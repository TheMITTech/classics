<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Socrates - GLAUCON
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>And so, Glaucon, we have arrived at the conclusion that in the 
<A NAME="12"></A>perfect State wives and children are to be in common; and that all education 
<A NAME="13"></A>and the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common, and the best philosophers 
<A NAME="14"></A>and the bravest warriors are to be their kings?
<A NAME="15"></A><BR><BR>That, replied Glaucon, has been acknowledged.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Yes, I said; and we have further acknowledged that the governors, when 
<A NAME="17"></A>appointed themselves, will take their soldiers and place them in houses 
<A NAME="18"></A>such as we were describing, which are common to all, and contain nothing 
<A NAME="19"></A>private, or individual; and about their property, you remember what we 
<A NAME="20"></A>agreed?
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions 
<A NAME="22"></A>of mankind; they were to be warrior athletes and guardians, receiving from 
<A NAME="23"></A>the other citizens, in lieu of annual payment, only their maintenance, 
<A NAME="24"></A>and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole 
<A NAME="25"></A>State.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>True, I said; and now that this division of our task is concluded, 
<A NAME="27"></A>let us find the point at which we digressed, that we may return into the 
<A NAME="28"></A>old path.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>There is no difficulty in returning; you implied, then as now, 
<A NAME="30"></A>that you had finished the description of the State: you said that such 
<A NAME="31"></A>a State was good, and that the man was good who answered to it, although, 
<A NAME="32"></A>as now appears, you had more excellent things to relate both of State and 
<A NAME="33"></A>man. And you said further, that if this was the true form, then the others 
<A NAME="34"></A>were false; and of the false forms, you said, as I remember, that there 
<A NAME="35"></A>were four principal ones, and that their defects, and the defects of the 
<A NAME="36"></A>individuals corresponding to them, were worth examining. When we had seen 
<A NAME="37"></A>all the individuals, and finally agreed as to who was the best and who 
<A NAME="38"></A>was the worst of them, we were to consider whether the best was not also 
<A NAME="39"></A>the happiest, and the worst the most miserable. I asked you what were the 
<A NAME="40"></A>four forms of government of which you spoke, and then Polemarchus and Adeimantus 
<A NAME="41"></A>put in their word; and you began again, and have found your way to the 
<A NAME="42"></A>point at which we have now arrived.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>Your recollection, I said, is most exact.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Then, like a wrestler, he replied, you must put yourself again in the 
<A NAME="45"></A>same position; and let me ask the same questions, and do you give me the 
<A NAME="46"></A>same answer which you were about to give me then.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>Yes, if I can, I will, I said.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>I shall particularly wish to hear what were the four constitutions 
<A NAME="49"></A>of which you were speaking.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>That question, I said, is easily answered: the four governments 
<A NAME="51"></A>of which I spoke, so far as they have distinct names, are, first, those 
<A NAME="52"></A>of Crete and Sparta, which are generally applauded; what is termed oligarchy 
<A NAME="53"></A>comes next; this is not equally approved, and is a form of government which 
<A NAME="54"></A>teems with evils: thirdly, democracy, which naturally follows oligarchy, 
<A NAME="55"></A>although very different: and lastly comes tyranny, great and famous, which 
<A NAME="56"></A>differs from them all, and is the fourth and worst disorder of a State. 
<A NAME="57"></A>I do not know, do you? of any other constitution which can be said to have 
<A NAME="58"></A>a distinct character. There are lordships and principalities which are 
<A NAME="59"></A>bought and sold, and some other intermediate forms of government. But these 
<A NAME="60"></A>are nondescripts and may be found equally among Hellenes and among 
<A NAME="61"></A>barbarians.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he replied, we certainly hear of many curious forms of government 
<A NAME="63"></A>which exist among them.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>Do you know, I said, that governments vary as the dispositions 
<A NAME="65"></A>of men vary, and that there must be as many of the one as there are of 
<A NAME="66"></A>the other? For we cannot suppose that States are made of 'oak and rock,' 
<A NAME="67"></A>and not out of the human natures which are in them, and which in a figure 
<A NAME="68"></A>turn the scale and draw other things after them?
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, the States are as the men are; they grow out of human 
<A NAME="70"></A>characters.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Then if the constitutions of States are five, the dispositions 
<A NAME="72"></A>of individual minds will also be five?
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Him who answers to aristocracy, and whom we rightly call just and good, 
<A NAME="75"></A>we have already described.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>We have.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Then let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures, being 
<A NAME="78"></A>the contentious and ambitious, who answer to the Spartan polity; also the 
<A NAME="79"></A>oligarchical, democratical, and tyrannical. Let us place the most just 
<A NAME="80"></A>by the side of the most unjust, and when we see them we shall be able to 
<A NAME="81"></A>compare the relative happiness or unhappiness of him who leads a life of 
<A NAME="82"></A>pure justice or pure injustice. The enquiry will then be completed. And 
<A NAME="83"></A>we shall know whether we ought to pursue injustice, as Thrasymachus advises, 
<A NAME="84"></A>or in accordance with the conclusions of the argument to prefer 
<A NAME="85"></A>justice.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he replied, we must do as you say.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Shall we follow our old plan, which we adopted with a view to clearness, 
<A NAME="88"></A>of taking the State first and then proceeding to the individual, and begin 
<A NAME="89"></A>with the government of honour? --I know of no name for such a government 
<A NAME="90"></A>other than timocracy, or perhaps timarchy. We will compare with this the 
<A NAME="91"></A>like character in the individual; and, after that, consider oligarchical 
<A NAME="92"></A>man; and then again we will turn our attention to democracy and the democratical 
<A NAME="93"></A>man; and lastly, we will go and view the city of tyranny, and once more 
<A NAME="94"></A>take a look into the tyrant's soul, and try to arrive at a satisfactory 
<A NAME="95"></A>decision.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>That way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very 
<A NAME="97"></A>suitable.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>First, then, I said, let us enquire how timocracy (the government of 
<A NAME="99"></A>honour) arises out of aristocracy (the government of the best). Clearly, 
<A NAME="100"></A>all political changes originate in divisions of the actual governing power; 
<A NAME="101"></A>a government which is united, however small, cannot be 
<A NAME="102"></A>moved.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>In what way, then, will our city be moved, and in what manner the two 
<A NAME="105"></A>classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or with one 
<A NAME="106"></A>another? Shall we, after the manner of Homer, pray the Muses to tell us 
<A NAME="107"></A>'how discord first arose'? Shall we imagine them in solemn mockery, to 
<A NAME="108"></A>play and jest with us as if we were children, and to address us in a lofty 
<A NAME="109"></A>tragic vein, making believe to be in earnest?
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>How would they address us?
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>After this manner: --A city which is thus constituted can hardly be 
<A NAME="112"></A>shaken; but, seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an end, 
<A NAME="113"></A>even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever, but will in time 
<A NAME="114"></A>be dissolved. And this is the dissolution: --In plants that grow in the 
<A NAME="115"></A>earth, as well as in animals that move on the earth's surface, fertility 
<A NAME="116"></A>and sterility of soul and body occur when the circumferences of the circles 
<A NAME="117"></A>of each are completed, which in short-lived existences pass over a short 
<A NAME="118"></A>space, and in long-lived ones over a long space. But to the knowledge of 
<A NAME="119"></A>human fecundity and sterility all the wisdom and education of your rulers 
<A NAME="120"></A>will not attain; the laws which regulate them will not be discovered by 
<A NAME="121"></A>an intelligence which is alloyed with sense, but will escape them, and 
<A NAME="122"></A>they will bring children into the world when they ought not. Now that which 
<A NAME="123"></A>is of divine birth has a period which is contained in a perfect number, 
<A NAME="124"></A>but the period of human birth is comprehended in a number in which first 
<A NAME="125"></A>increments by involution and evolution (or squared and cubed) obtaining 
<A NAME="126"></A>three intervals and four terms of like and unlike, waxing and waning numbers, 
<A NAME="127"></A>make all the terms commensurable and agreeable to one another. The base 
<A NAME="128"></A>of these (3) with a third added (4) when combined with five (20) and raised 
<A NAME="129"></A>to the third power furnishes two harmonies; the first a square which is 
<A NAME="130"></A>a hundred times as great (400 = 4 X 100), and the other a figure having 
<A NAME="131"></A>one side equal to the former, but oblong, consisting of a hundred numbers 
<A NAME="132"></A>squared upon rational diameters of a square (i. e. omitting fractions), 
<A NAME="133"></A>the side of which is five (7 X 7 = 49 X 100 = 4900), each of them being 
<A NAME="134"></A>less by one (than the perfect square which includes the fractions, sc. 
<A NAME="135"></A>50) or less by two perfect squares of irrational diameters (of a square 
<A NAME="136"></A>the side of which is five = 50 + 50 = 100); and a hundred cubes of three 
<A NAME="137"></A>(27 X 100 = 2700 + 4900 + 400 = 8000). Now this number represents a geometrical 
<A NAME="138"></A>figure which has control over the good and evil of births. For when your 
<A NAME="139"></A>guardians are ignorant of the law of births, and unite bride and bridegroom 
<A NAME="140"></A>out of season, the children will not be goodly or fortunate. And though 
<A NAME="141"></A>only the best of them will be appointed by their predecessors, still they 
<A NAME="142"></A>will be unworthy to hold their fathers' places, and when they come into 
<A NAME="143"></A>power as guardians, they will soon be found to fall in taking care of us, 
<A NAME="144"></A>the Muses, first by under-valuing music; which neglect will soon extend 
<A NAME="145"></A>to gymnastic; and hence the young men of your State will be less cultivated. 
<A NAME="146"></A>In the succeeding generation rulers will be appointed who have lost the 
<A NAME="147"></A>guardian power of testing the metal of your different races, which, like 
<A NAME="148"></A>Hesiod's, are of gold and silver and brass and iron. And so iron will be 
<A NAME="149"></A>mingled with silver, and brass with gold, and hence there will arise dissimilarity 
<A NAME="150"></A>and inequality and irregularity, which always and in all places are causes 
<A NAME="151"></A>of hatred and war. This the Muses affirm to be the stock from which discord 
<A NAME="152"></A>has sprung, wherever arising; and this is their answer to 
<A NAME="153"></A>us.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>Yes, and we may assume that they answer truly.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Why, yes, I said, of course they answer truly; how can the Muses speak 
<A NAME="156"></A>falsely?
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>And what do the Muses say next?
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>When discord arose, then the two races were drawn different ways: the 
<A NAME="159"></A>iron and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and 
<A NAME="160"></A>silver; but the gold and silver races, not wanting money but having the 
<A NAME="161"></A>true riches in their own nature, inclined towards virtue and the ancient 
<A NAME="162"></A>order of things. There was a battle between them, and at last they agreed 
<A NAME="163"></A>to distribute their land and houses among individual owners; and they enslaved 
<A NAME="164"></A>their friends and maintainers, whom they had formerly protected in the 
<A NAME="165"></A>condition of freemen, and made of them subjects and servants; and they 
<A NAME="166"></A>themselves were engaged in war and in keeping a watch against 
<A NAME="167"></A>them.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>I believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the 
<A NAME="169"></A>change.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>And the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate 
<A NAME="171"></A>between oligarchy and aristocracy?
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>Such will be the change, and after the change has been made, how will 
<A NAME="174"></A>they proceed? Clearly, the new State, being in a mean between oligarchy 
<A NAME="175"></A>and the perfect State, will partly follow one and partly the other, and 
<A NAME="176"></A>will also have some peculiarities.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>In the honour given to rulers, in the abstinence of the warrior class 
<A NAME="179"></A>from agriculture, handicrafts, and trade in general, in the institution 
<A NAME="180"></A>of common meals, and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military training 
<A NAME="181"></A>--in all these respects this State will resemble the 
<A NAME="182"></A>former.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>But in the fear of admitting philosophers to power, because they are 
<A NAME="185"></A>no longer to be had simple and earnest, but are made up of mixed elements; 
<A NAME="186"></A>and in turning from them to passionate and less complex characters, who 
<A NAME="187"></A>are by nature fitted for war rather than peace; and in the value set by 
<A NAME="188"></A>them upon military stratagems and contrivances, and in the waging of everlasting 
<A NAME="189"></A>wars --this State will be for the most part peculiar.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Yes, I said; and men of this stamp will be covetous of money, like 
<A NAME="192"></A>those who live in oligarchies; they will have, a fierce secret longing 
<A NAME="193"></A>after gold and silver, which they will hoard in dark places, having magazines 
<A NAME="194"></A>and treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment of them; also 
<A NAME="195"></A>castles which are just nests for their eggs, and in which they will spend 
<A NAME="196"></A>large sums on their wives, or on any others whom they 
<A NAME="197"></A>please.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>That is most true, he said.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>And they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring 
<A NAME="200"></A>the money which they prize; they will spend that which is another man's 
<A NAME="201"></A>on the gratification of their desires, stealing their pleasures and running 
<A NAME="202"></A>away like children from the law, their father: they have been schooled 
<A NAME="203"></A>not by gentle influences but by force, for they have neglected her who 
<A NAME="204"></A>is the true Muse, the companion of reason and philosophy, and have honoured 
<A NAME="205"></A>gymnastic more than music.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>Undoubtedly, he said, the form of government which you describe 
<A NAME="207"></A>is a mixture of good and evil.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>Why, there is a mixture, I said; but one thing, and one thing only, 
<A NAME="209"></A>is predominantly seen, --the spirit of contention and ambition; and these 
<A NAME="210"></A>are due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited 
<A NAME="211"></A>element.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>Assuredly, he said.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Such is the origin and such the character of this State, which has 
<A NAME="214"></A>been described in outline only; the more perfect execution was not required, 
<A NAME="215"></A>for a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly just and 
<A NAME="216"></A>most perfectly unjust; and to go through all the States and all the characters 
<A NAME="217"></A>of men, omitting none of them, would be an interminable 
<A NAME="218"></A>labour.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he replied.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Now what man answers to this form of government-how did he come into 
<A NAME="221"></A>being, and what is he like?
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>Socrates - ADEIMANTUS
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>I think, said Adeimantus, that in the spirit of contention which 
<A NAME="224"></A>characterises him, he is not unlike our friend Glaucon.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps, I said, he may be like him in that one point; but there 
<A NAME="226"></A>are other respects in which he is very different.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>In what respects?
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>He should have more of self-assertion and be less cultivated, and yet 
<A NAME="229"></A>a friend of culture; and he should be a good listener, but no speaker. 
<A NAME="230"></A>Such a person is apt to be rough with slaves, unlike the educated man, 
<A NAME="231"></A>who is too proud for that; and he will also be courteous to freemen, and 
<A NAME="232"></A>remarkably obedient to authority; he is a lover of power and a lover of 
<A NAME="233"></A>honour; claiming to be a ruler, not because he is eloquent, or on any ground 
<A NAME="234"></A>of that sort, but because he is a soldier and has performed feats of arms; 
<A NAME="235"></A>he is also a lover of gymnastic exercises and of the 
<A NAME="236"></A>chase.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that is the type of character which answers to 
<A NAME="238"></A>timocracy.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Such an one will despise riches only when he is young; but as he gets 
<A NAME="240"></A>older he will be more and more attracted to them, because he has a piece 
<A NAME="241"></A>of the avaricious nature in him, and is not singleminded towards virtue, 
<A NAME="242"></A>having lost his best guardian.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>Who was that? said Adeimantus.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Philosophy, I said, tempered with music, who comes and takes her abode 
<A NAME="245"></A>in a man, and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout 
<A NAME="246"></A>life.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>Good, he said.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Such, I said, is the timocratical youth, and he is like the timocratical 
<A NAME="249"></A>State.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>His origin is as follows: --He is often the young son of a grave father, 
<A NAME="252"></A>who dwells in an ill-governed city, of which he declines the honours and 
<A NAME="253"></A>offices, and will not go to law, or exert himself in any way, but is ready 
<A NAME="254"></A>to waive his rights in order that he may escape trouble.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>And how does the son come into being?
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>The character of the son begins to develop when he hears his mother 
<A NAME="257"></A>complaining that her husband has no place in the government, of which the 
<A NAME="258"></A>consequence is that she has no precedence among other women. Further, when 
<A NAME="259"></A>she sees her husband not very eager about money, and instead of battling 
<A NAME="260"></A>and railing in the law courts or assembly, taking whatever happens to him 
<A NAME="261"></A>quietly; and when she observes that his thoughts always centre in himself, 
<A NAME="262"></A>while he treats her with very considerable indifference, she is annoyed, 
<A NAME="263"></A>and says to her son that his father is only half a man and far too easy-going: 
<A NAME="264"></A>adding all the other complaints about her own ill-treatment which women 
<A NAME="265"></A>are so fond of rehearsing.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>Yes, said Adeimantus, they give us plenty of them, and their complaints 
<A NAME="267"></A>are so like themselves.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>And you know, I said, that the old servants also, who are supposed 
<A NAME="269"></A>to be attached to the family, from time to time talk privately in the same 
<A NAME="270"></A>strain to the son; and if they see any one who owes money to his father, 
<A NAME="271"></A>or is wronging him in any way, and he falls to prosecute them, they tell 
<A NAME="272"></A>the youth that when he grows up he must retaliate upon people of this sort, 
<A NAME="273"></A>and be more of a man than his father. He has only to walk abroad and he 
<A NAME="274"></A>hears and sees the same sort of thing: those who do their own business 
<A NAME="275"></A>in the city are called simpletons, and held in no esteem, while the busy-bodies 
<A NAME="276"></A>are honoured and applauded. The result is that the young man, hearing and 
<A NAME="277"></A>seeing all these thing --hearing too, the words of his father, and having 
<A NAME="278"></A>a nearer view of his way of life, and making comparisons of him and others 
<A NAME="279"></A>--is drawn opposite ways: while his father is watering and nourishing the 
<A NAME="280"></A>rational principle in his soul, the others are encouraging the passionate 
<A NAME="281"></A>and appetitive; and he being not originally of a bad nature, but having 
<A NAME="282"></A>kept bad company, is at last brought by their joint influence to a middle 
<A NAME="283"></A>point, and gives up the kingdom which is within him to the middle principle 
<A NAME="284"></A>of contentiousness and passion, and becomes arrogant and 
<A NAME="285"></A>ambitious.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>You seem to me to have described his origin 
<A NAME="287"></A>perfectly.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Then we have now, I said, the second form of government and the second 
<A NAME="289"></A>type of character?
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>We have.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Next, let us look at another man who, as Aeschylus 
<A NAME="292"></A>says,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>Is set over against another State; or rather, as our plan requires, 
<A NAME="294"></A>begin with the State.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>By all means.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>I believe that oligarchy follows next in order.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>And what manner of government do you term oligarchy?
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>A government resting on a valuation of property, in which the rich 
<A NAME="299"></A>have power and the poor man is deprived of it.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>I understand, he replied.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Ought I not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to 
<A NAME="302"></A>oligarchy arises?
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>Well, I said, no eyes are required in order to see how the one passes 
<A NAME="305"></A>into the other.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>How?
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>The accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is 
<A NAME="308"></A>ruin the of timocracy; they invent illegal modes of expenditure; for what 
<A NAME="309"></A>do they or their wives care about the law?
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>Yes, indeed.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>And then one, seeing another grow rich, seeks to rival him, and thus 
<A NAME="312"></A>the great mass of the citizens become lovers of money.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>Likely enough.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>And so they grow richer and richer, and the more they think of making 
<A NAME="315"></A>a fortune the less they think of virtue; for when riches and virtue are 
<A NAME="316"></A>placed together in the scales of the balance, the one always rises as the 
<A NAME="317"></A>other falls.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>And in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the State, 
<A NAME="320"></A>virtue and the virtuous are dishonoured.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>And what is honoured is cultivated, and that which has no honour is 
<A NAME="323"></A>neglected.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>That is obvious.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>And so at last, instead of loving contention and glory, men become 
<A NAME="326"></A>lovers of trade and money; they honour and look up to the rich man, and 
<A NAME="327"></A>make a ruler of him, and dishonour the poor man.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>They do so.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>They next proceed to make a law which fixes a sum of money as the qualification 
<A NAME="330"></A>of citizenship; the sum is higher in one place and lower in another, as 
<A NAME="331"></A>the oligarchy is more or less exclusive; and they allow no one whose property 
<A NAME="332"></A>falls below the amount fixed to have any share in the government. These 
<A NAME="333"></A>changes in the constitution they effect by force of arms, if intimidation 
<A NAME="334"></A>has not already done their work.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>And this, speaking generally, is the way in which oligarchy is 
<A NAME="337"></A>established.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; but what are the characteristics of this form of 
<A NAME="339"></A>government, and what are the defects of which we were 
<A NAME="340"></A>speaking?
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>First of all, I said, consider the nature of the qualification 
<A NAME="342"></A>just think what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their 
<A NAME="343"></A>property, and a poor man were refused permission to steer, even though 
<A NAME="344"></A>he were a better pilot?
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>You mean that they would shipwreck?
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>Yes; and is not this true of the government of anything?
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>I should imagine so.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Except a city? --or would you include a city?
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Nay, he said, the case of a city is the strongest of all, inasmuch 
<A NAME="350"></A>as the rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of 
<A NAME="351"></A>all.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>This, then, will be the first great defect of 
<A NAME="353"></A>oligarchy?
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>And here is another defect which is quite as bad.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>What defect?
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>The inevitable division: such a State is not one, but two States, the 
<A NAME="358"></A>one of poor, the other of rich men; and they are living on the same spot 
<A NAME="359"></A>and always conspiring against one another.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>That, surely, is at least as bad.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Another discreditable feature is, that, for a like reason, they are 
<A NAME="362"></A>incapable of carrying on any war. Either they arm the multitude, and then 
<A NAME="363"></A>they are more afraid of them than of the enemy; or, if they do not call 
<A NAME="364"></A>them out in the hour of battle, they are oligarchs indeed, few to fight 
<A NAME="365"></A>as they are few to rule. And at the same time their fondness for money 
<A NAME="366"></A>makes them unwilling to pay taxes.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR>How discreditable!
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>And, as we said before, under such a constitution the same persons 
<A NAME="369"></A>have too many callings --they are husbandmen, tradesmen, warriors, all 
<A NAME="370"></A>in one. Does that look well?
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>Anything but well.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>There is another evil which is, perhaps, the greatest of all, and to 
<A NAME="373"></A>which this State first begins to be liable.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>What evil?
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>A man may sell all that he has, and another may acquire his property; 
<A NAME="376"></A>yet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a 
<A NAME="377"></A>part, being neither trader, nor artisan, nor horseman, nor hoplite, but 
<A NAME="378"></A>only a poor, helpless creature.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that is an evil which also first begins in this 
<A NAME="380"></A>State.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>The evil is certainly not prevented there; for oligarchies have both 
<A NAME="382"></A>the extremes of great wealth and utter poverty.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>But think again: In his wealthy days, while he was spending his money, 
<A NAME="385"></A>was a man of this sort a whit more good to the State for the purposes of 
<A NAME="386"></A>citizenship? Or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body, although 
<A NAME="387"></A>in truth he was neither ruler nor subject, but just a 
<A NAME="388"></A>spendthrift?
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>As you say, he seemed to be a ruler, but was only a 
<A NAME="390"></A>spendthrift.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>May we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the 
<A NAME="392"></A>drone in the honeycomb, and that the one is the plague of the city as the 
<A NAME="393"></A>other is of the hive?
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>Just so, Socrates.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>And God has made the flying drones, Adeimantus, all without stings, 
<A NAME="396"></A>whereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but others 
<A NAME="397"></A>have dreadful stings; of the stingless class are those who in their old 
<A NAME="398"></A>age end as paupers; of the stingers come all the criminal class, as they 
<A NAME="399"></A>are termed.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>Most true, he said.
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Clearly then, whenever you see paupers in a State, somewhere in that 
<A NAME="402"></A>neighborhood there are hidden away thieves, and cutpurses and robbers of 
<A NAME="403"></A>temples, and all sorts of malefactors.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>Well, I said, and in oligarchical States do you not find 
<A NAME="406"></A>paupers?
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Yes, he said; nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a 
<A NAME="408"></A>ruler.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>And may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals 
<A NAME="410"></A>to be found in them, rogues who have stings, and whom the authorities are 
<A NAME="411"></A>careful to restrain by force?
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, we may be so bold.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>The existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education, 
<A NAME="414"></A>ill-training, and an evil constitution of the State?
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>Such, then, is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy; and there 
<A NAME="417"></A>may be many other evils.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>Very likely.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Then oligarchy, or the form of government in which the rulers are elected 
<A NAME="420"></A>for their wealth, may now be dismissed. Let us next proceed to consider 
<A NAME="421"></A>the nature and origin of the individual who answers to this 
<A NAME="422"></A>State.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>By all means.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this 
<A NAME="425"></A>wise?
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>How?
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>A time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son: at first 
<A NAME="428"></A>he begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps, but presently 
<A NAME="429"></A>he sees him of a sudden foundering against the State as upon a sunken reef, 
<A NAME="430"></A>and he and all that he has is lost; he may have been a general or some 
<A NAME="431"></A>other high officer who is brought to trial under a prejudice raised by 
<A NAME="432"></A>informers, and either put to death, or exiled, or deprived of the privileges 
<A NAME="433"></A>of a citizen, and all his property taken from him.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>Nothing more likely.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>And the son has seen and known all this --he is a ruined man, and his 
<A NAME="436"></A>fear has taught him to knock ambition and passion head-foremost from his 
<A NAME="437"></A>bosom's throne; humbled by poverty he takes to money-making and by mean 
<A NAME="438"></A>and miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together. Is not such 
<A NAME="439"></A>an one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the vacant 
<A NAME="440"></A>throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him, girt with tiara 
<A NAME="441"></A>and chain and scimitar?
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>Most true, he replied.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>And when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground obediently 
<A NAME="444"></A>on either side of their sovereign, and taught them to know their place, 
<A NAME="445"></A>he compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be turned into 
<A NAME="446"></A>larger ones, and will not allow the other to worship and admire anything 
<A NAME="447"></A>but riches and rich men, or to be ambitious of anything so much as the 
<A NAME="448"></A>acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it.
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR>Of all changes, he said, there is none so speedy or so sure as 
<A NAME="450"></A>the conversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious 
<A NAME="451"></A>one.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>And the avaricious, I said, is the oligarchical 
<A NAME="453"></A>youth?
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Yes, he said; at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like 
<A NAME="455"></A>the State out of which oligarchy came.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>Let us then consider whether there is any likeness between 
<A NAME="457"></A>them.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Very good.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>First, then, they resemble one another in the value which they set 
<A NAME="460"></A>upon wealth?
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Also in their penurious, laborious character; the individual only satisfies 
<A NAME="463"></A>his necessary appetites, and confines his expenditure to them; his other 
<A NAME="464"></A>desires he subdues, under the idea that they are unprofitable.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>He is a shabby fellow, who saves something out of everything and makes 
<A NAME="467"></A>a purse for himself; and this is the sort of man whom the vulgar applaud. 
<A NAME="468"></A>Is he not a true image of the State which he represents?
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>He appears to me to be so; at any rate money is highly valued by 
<A NAME="470"></A>him as well as by the State.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>You see that he is not a man of cultivation, I 
<A NAME="472"></A>said.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>I imagine not, he said; had he been educated he would never have made 
<A NAME="474"></A>a blind god director of his chorus, or given him chief 
<A NAME="475"></A>honour.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR>Excellent! I said. Yet consider: Must we not further admit that 
<A NAME="477"></A>owing to this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike 
<A NAME="478"></A>desires as of pauper and rogue, which are forcibly kept down by his general 
<A NAME="479"></A>habit of life?
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his 
<A NAME="482"></A>rogueries?
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>Where must I look?
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>You should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting dishonestly, 
<A NAME="485"></A>as in the guardianship of an orphan.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>Aye.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>It will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give 
<A NAME="488"></A>him a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad passions by an enforced 
<A NAME="489"></A>virtue; not making them see that they are wrong, or taming them by reason, 
<A NAME="490"></A>but by necessity and fear constraining them, and because he trembles for 
<A NAME="491"></A>his possessions.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>To be sure.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Yes, indeed, my dear friend, but you will find that the natural desires 
<A NAME="494"></A>of the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to spend 
<A NAME="495"></A>what is not his own.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>Yes, and they will be strong in him too.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>The man, then, will be at war with himself; he will be two men, and 
<A NAME="498"></A>not one; but, in general, his better desires will be found to prevail over 
<A NAME="499"></A>his inferior ones.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>For these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most people; 
<A NAME="502"></A>yet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will flee far away 
<A NAME="503"></A>and never come near him.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>I should expect so.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>And surely, the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in 
<A NAME="506"></A>a State for any prize of victory, or other object of honourable ambition; 
<A NAME="507"></A>he will not spend his money in the contest for glory; so afraid is he of 
<A NAME="508"></A>awakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help and join in 
<A NAME="509"></A>the struggle; in true oligarchical fashion he fights with a small part 
<A NAME="510"></A>only of his resources, and the result commonly is that he loses the prize 
<A NAME="511"></A>and saves his money.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Can we any longer doubt, then, that the miser and money-maker answers 
<A NAME="514"></A>to the oligarchical State?
<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR>There can be no doubt.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Next comes democracy; of this the origin and nature have still to be 
<A NAME="517"></A>considered by us; and then we will enquire into the ways of the democratic 
<A NAME="518"></A>man, and bring him up for judgement.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>That, he said, is our method.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Well, I said, and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy 
<A NAME="521"></A>arise? Is it not on this wise? --The good at which such a State alms is 
<A NAME="522"></A>to become as rich as possible, a desire which is insatiable?
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>What then?
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>The rulers, being aware that their power rests upon their wealth, refuse 
<A NAME="525"></A>to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because they 
<A NAME="526"></A>gain by their ruin; they take interest from them and buy up their estates 
<A NAME="527"></A>and thus increase their own wealth and importance?
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>To be sure.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>There can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of moderation 
<A NAME="530"></A>cannot exist together in citizens of the same State to any considerable 
<A NAME="531"></A>extent; one or the other will be disregarded.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR>That is tolerably clear.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>And in oligarchical States, from the general spread of carelessness 
<A NAME="534"></A>and extravagance, men of good family have often been reduced to 
<A NAME="535"></A>beggary?
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>Yes, often.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>And still they remain in the city; there they are, ready to sting and 
<A NAME="538"></A>fully armed, and some of them owe money, some have forfeited their citizenship; 
<A NAME="539"></A>a third class are in both predicaments; and they hate and conspire against 
<A NAME="540"></A>those who have got their property, and against everybody else, and are 
<A NAME="541"></A>eager for revolution.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>On the other hand, the men of business, stooping as they walk, and 
<A NAME="544"></A>pretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined, insert 
<A NAME="545"></A>their sting --that is, their money --into some one else who is not on his 
<A NAME="546"></A>guard against them, and recover the parent sum many times over multiplied 
<A NAME="547"></A>into a family of children: and so they make drone and pauper to abound 
<A NAME="548"></A>in the State.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, there are plenty of them --that is 
<A NAME="550"></A>certain.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>The evil blazes up like a fire; and they will not extinguish it, either 
<A NAME="552"></A>by restricting a man's use of his own property, or by another 
<A NAME="553"></A>remedy:
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>What other?
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>One which is the next best, and has the advantage of compelling the 
<A NAME="556"></A>citizens to look to their characters: --Let there be a general rule that 
<A NAME="557"></A>every one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk, and there 
<A NAME="558"></A>will be less of this scandalous money-making, and the evils of which we 
<A NAME="559"></A>were speaking will be greatly lessened in the State.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>Yes, they will be greatly lessened.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>At present the governors, induced by the motives which I have named, 
<A NAME="562"></A>treat their subjects badly; while they and their adherents, especially 
<A NAME="563"></A>the young men of the governing class, are habituated to lead a life of 
<A NAME="564"></A>luxury and idleness both of body and mind; they do nothing, and are incapable 
<A NAME="565"></A>of resisting either pleasure or pain.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>They themselves care only for making money, and are as indifferent 
<A NAME="568"></A>as the pauper to the cultivation of virtue.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>Yes, quite as indifferent.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Such is the state of affairs which prevails among them. And often rulers 
<A NAME="571"></A>and their subjects may come in one another's way, whether on a pilgrimage 
<A NAME="572"></A>or a march, as fellow-soldiers or fellow-sailors; aye, and they may observe 
<A NAME="573"></A>the behaviour of each other in the very moment of danger --for where danger 
<A NAME="574"></A>is, there is no fear that the poor will be despised by the rich --and very 
<A NAME="575"></A>likely the wiry sunburnt poor man may be placed in battle at the side of 
<A NAME="576"></A>a wealthy one who has never spoilt his complexion and has plenty of superfluous 
<A NAME="577"></A>flesh --when he sees such an one puffing and at his wit's end, how can 
<A NAME="578"></A>he avoid drawing the conclusion that men like him are only rich because 
<A NAME="579"></A>no one has the courage to despoil them? And when they meet in private will 
<A NAME="580"></A>not people be saying to one another 'Our warriors are not good for 
<A NAME="581"></A>much'?
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, I am quite aware that this is their way of 
<A NAME="583"></A>talking.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>And, as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from without 
<A NAME="585"></A>may bring on illness, and sometimes even when there is no external provocation 
<A NAME="586"></A>a commotion may arise within-in the same way wherever there is weakness 
<A NAME="587"></A>in the State there is also likely to be illness, of which the occasions 
<A NAME="588"></A>may be very slight, the one party introducing from without their oligarchical, 
<A NAME="589"></A>the other their democratical allies, and then the State falls sick, and 
<A NAME="590"></A>is at war with herself; and may be at times distracted, even when there 
<A NAME="591"></A>is no external cause.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>Yes, surely.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>And then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their 
<A NAME="594"></A>opponents, slaughtering some and banishing some, while to the remainder 
<A NAME="595"></A>they give an equal share of freedom and power; and this is the form of 
<A NAME="596"></A>government in which the magistrates are commonly elected by 
<A NAME="597"></A>lot.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that is the nature of democracy, whether the revolution 
<A NAME="599"></A>has been effected by arms, or whether fear has caused the opposite party 
<A NAME="600"></A>to withdraw.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>And now what is their manner of life, and what sort of a government 
<A NAME="602"></A>have they? for as the government is, such will be the 
<A NAME="603"></A>man.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR>Clearly, he said.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>In the first place, are they not free; and is not the city full of 
<A NAME="606"></A>freedom and frankness --a man may say and do what he 
<A NAME="607"></A>likes?
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>'Tis said so, he replied.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>And where freedom is, the individual is clearly able to order for himself 
<A NAME="610"></A>his own life as he pleases?
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Then in this kind of State there will be the greatest variety of human 
<A NAME="613"></A>natures?
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>There will.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>This, then, seems likely to be the fairest of States, being an embroidered 
<A NAME="616"></A>robe which is spangled with every sort of flower. And just as women and 
<A NAME="617"></A>children think a variety of colours to be of all things most charming, 
<A NAME="618"></A>so there are many men to whom this State, which is spangled with the manners 
<A NAME="619"></A>and characters of mankind, will appear to be the fairest of 
<A NAME="620"></A>States.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Yes, my good Sir, and there will be no better in which to look for 
<A NAME="623"></A>a government.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>Why?
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>Because of the liberty which reigns there --they have a complete assortment 
<A NAME="626"></A>of constitutions; and he who has a mind to establish a State, as we have 
<A NAME="627"></A>been doing, must go to a democracy as he would to a bazaar at which they 
<A NAME="628"></A>sell them, and pick out the one that suits him; then, when he has made 
<A NAME="629"></A>his choice, he may found his State.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>He will be sure to have patterns enough.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>And there being no necessity, I said, for you to govern in this State, 
<A NAME="632"></A>even if you have the capacity, or to be governed, unless you like, or go 
<A NAME="633"></A>to war when the rest go to war, or to be at peace when others are at peace, 
<A NAME="634"></A>unless you are so disposed --there being no necessity also, because some 
<A NAME="635"></A>law forbids you to hold office or be a dicast, that you should not hold 
<A NAME="636"></A>office or be a dicast, if you have a fancy --is not this a way of life 
<A NAME="637"></A>which for the moment is supremely delightful
<A NAME="638"></A><BR><BR>For the moment, yes.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>And is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite charming? 
<A NAME="640"></A>Have you not observed how, in a democracy, many persons, although they 
<A NAME="641"></A>have been sentenced to death or exile, just stay where they are and walk 
<A NAME="642"></A>about the world --the gentleman parades like a hero, and nobody sees or 
<A NAME="643"></A>cares?
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he replied, many and many a one.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>See too, I said, the forgiving spirit of democracy, and the 'don't 
<A NAME="646"></A>care' about trifles, and the disregard which she shows of all the fine 
<A NAME="647"></A>principles which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the city --as 
<A NAME="648"></A>when we said that, except in the case of some rarely gifted nature, there 
<A NAME="649"></A>never will be a good man who has not from his childhood been used to play 
<A NAME="650"></A>amid things of beauty and make of them a joy and a study --how grandly 
<A NAME="651"></A>does she trample all these fine notions of ours under her feet, never giving 
<A NAME="652"></A>a thought to the pursuits which make a statesman, and promoting to honour 
<A NAME="653"></A>any one who professes to be the people's friend.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>Yes, she is of a noble spirit.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>These and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy, which 
<A NAME="656"></A>is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and dispensing 
<A NAME="657"></A>a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>We know her well.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Consider now, I said, what manner of man the individual is, or rather 
<A NAME="660"></A>consider, as in the case of the State, how he comes into 
<A NAME="661"></A>being.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>Very good, he said.
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>Is not this the way --he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical 
<A NAME="664"></A>father who has trained him in his own habits?
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>And, like his father, he keeps under by force the pleasures which are 
<A NAME="667"></A>of the spending and not of the getting sort, being those which are called 
<A NAME="668"></A>unnecessary?
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>Obviously.
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Would you like, for the sake of clearness, to distinguish which are 
<A NAME="671"></A>the necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures?
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>I should.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid, and of 
<A NAME="674"></A>which the satisfaction is a benefit to us? And they are rightly so, because 
<A NAME="675"></A>we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial and what is necessary, 
<A NAME="676"></A>and cannot help it.
<A NAME="677"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>We are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary?
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>We are not.
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>And the desires of which a man may get rid, if he takes pains from 
<A NAME="681"></A>his youth upwards --of which the presence, moreover, does no good, and 
<A NAME="682"></A>in some cases the reverse of good --shall we not be right in saying that 
<A NAME="683"></A>all these are unnecessary?
<A NAME="684"></A><BR><BR>Yes, certainly.
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>Suppose we select an example of either kind, in order that we may have 
<A NAME="686"></A>a general notion of them?
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR>Very good.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>Will not the desire of eating, that is, of simple food and condiments, 
<A NAME="689"></A>in so far as they are required for health and strength, be of the necessary 
<A NAME="690"></A>class?
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>That is what I should suppose.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>The pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways; it does us good and 
<A NAME="693"></A>it is essential to the continuance of life?
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>But the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for 
<A NAME="696"></A>health?
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>And the desire which goes beyond this, or more delicate food, or other 
<A NAME="699"></A>luxuries, which might generally be got rid of, if controlled and trained 
<A NAME="700"></A>in youth, and is hurtful to the body, and hurtful to the soul in the pursuit 
<A NAME="701"></A>of wisdom and virtue, may be rightly called unnecessary?
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>May we not say that these desires spend, and that the others make money 
<A NAME="704"></A>because they conduce to production?
<A NAME="705"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>And of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same holds 
<A NAME="707"></A>good?
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>And the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures 
<A NAME="710"></A>and desires of this sort, and was the slave of the unnecessary desires, 
<A NAME="711"></A>whereas he who was subject o the necessary only was miserly and 
<A NAME="712"></A>oligarchical?
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Again, let us see how the democratical man grows out of the oligarchical: 
<A NAME="715"></A>the following, as I suspect, is commonly the process.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR>What is the process?
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>When a young man who has been brought up as we were just now describing, 
<A NAME="718"></A>in a vulgar and miserly way, has tasted drones' honey and has come to associate 
<A NAME="719"></A>with fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide for him all sorts 
<A NAME="720"></A>of refinements and varieties of pleasure --then, as you may imagine, the 
<A NAME="721"></A>change will begin of the oligarchical principle within him into the 
<A NAME="722"></A>democratical?
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>Inevitably.
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>And as in the city like was helping like, and the change was effected 
<A NAME="725"></A>by an alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens, so 
<A NAME="726"></A>too the young man is changed by a class of desires coming from without 
<A NAME="727"></A>to assist the desires within him, that which is and alike again helping 
<A NAME="728"></A>that which is akin and alike?
<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>And if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within 
<A NAME="731"></A>him, whether the influence of a father or of kindred, advising or rebuking 
<A NAME="732"></A>him, then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite faction, and 
<A NAME="733"></A>he goes to war with himself.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR>It must be so.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>And there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the 
<A NAME="736"></A>oligarchical, and some of his desires die, and others are banished; a spirit 
<A NAME="737"></A>of reverence enters into the young man's soul and order is 
<A NAME="738"></A>restored.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that sometimes happens.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>And then, again, after the old desires have been driven out, fresh 
<A NAME="741"></A>ones spring up, which are akin to them, and because he, their father, does 
<A NAME="742"></A>not know how to educate them, wax fierce and numerous.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that is apt to be the way.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>They draw him to his old associates, and holding secret intercourse 
<A NAME="745"></A>with them, breed and multiply in him.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>At length they seize upon the citadel of the young man's soul, which 
<A NAME="748"></A>they perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits and true 
<A NAME="749"></A>words, which make their abode in the minds of men who are dear to the gods, 
<A NAME="750"></A>and are their best guardians and sentinels.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR>None better.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>False and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their 
<A NAME="753"></A>place.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>They are certain to do so.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>And so the young man returns into the country of the lotus-eaters, 
<A NAME="756"></A>and takes up his dwelling there in the face of all men; and if any help 
<A NAME="757"></A>be sent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him, the aforesaid vain 
<A NAME="758"></A>conceits shut the gate of the king's fastness; and they will neither allow 
<A NAME="759"></A>the embassy itself to enter, private if private advisers offer the fatherly 
<A NAME="760"></A>counsel of the aged will they listen to them or receive them. There is 
<A NAME="761"></A>a battle and they gain the day, and then modesty, which they call silliness, 
<A NAME="762"></A>is ignominiously thrust into exile by them, and temperance, which they 
<A NAME="763"></A>nickname unmanliness, is trampled in the mire and cast forth; they persuade 
<A NAME="764"></A>men that moderation and orderly expenditure are vulgarity and meanness, 
<A NAME="765"></A>and so, by the help of a rabble of evil appetites, they drive them beyond 
<A NAME="766"></A>the border.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR><BR>Yes, with a will.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>And when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of him who is now 
<A NAME="769"></A>in their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries, the 
<A NAME="770"></A>next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy and waste 
<A NAME="771"></A>and impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads, and a great 
<A NAME="772"></A>company with them, hymning their praises and calling them by sweet names; 
<A NAME="773"></A>insolence they term breeding, and anarchy liberty, and waste magnificence, 
<A NAME="774"></A>and impudence courage. And so the young man passes out of his original 
<A NAME="775"></A>nature, which was trained in the school of necessity, into the freedom 
<A NAME="776"></A>and libertinism of useless and unnecessary pleasures.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, the change in him is visible enough.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>After this he lives on, spending his money and labour and time on unnecessary 
<A NAME="779"></A>pleasures quite as much as on necessary ones; but if he be fortunate, and 
<A NAME="780"></A>is not too much disordered in his wits, when years have elapsed, and the 
<A NAME="781"></A>heyday of passion is over --supposing that he then re-admits into the city 
<A NAME="782"></A>some part of the exiled virtues, and does not wholly give himself up to 
<A NAME="783"></A>their successors --in that case he balances his pleasures and lives in 
<A NAME="784"></A>a sort of equilibrium, putting the government of himself into the hands 
<A NAME="785"></A>of the one which comes first and wins the turn; and when he has had enough 
<A NAME="786"></A>of that, then into the hands of another; he despises none of them but encourages 
<A NAME="787"></A>them all equally.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Neither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word 
<A NAME="790"></A>of advice; if any one says to him that some pleasures are the satisfactions 
<A NAME="791"></A>of good and noble desires, and others of evil desires, and that he ought 
<A NAME="792"></A>to use and honour some and chastise and master the others --whenever this 
<A NAME="793"></A>is repeated to him he shakes his head and says that they are all alike, 
<A NAME="794"></A>and that one is as good as another.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; that is the way with him.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>Yes, I said, he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the 
<A NAME="797"></A>hour; and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute; then 
<A NAME="798"></A>he becomes a water-drinker, and tries to get thin; then he takes a turn 
<A NAME="799"></A>at gymnastics; sometimes idling and neglecting everything, then once more 
<A NAME="800"></A>living the life of a philosopher; often he-is busy with politics, and starts 
<A NAME="801"></A>to his feet and says and does whatever comes into his head; and, if he 
<A NAME="802"></A>is emulous of any one who is a warrior, off he is in that direction, or 
<A NAME="803"></A>of men of business, once more in that. His life has neither law nor order; 
<A NAME="804"></A>and this distracted existence he terms joy and bliss and freedom; and so 
<A NAME="805"></A>he goes on.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he replied, he is all liberty and equality.
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>Yes, I said; his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the 
<A NAME="808"></A>lives of many; --he answers to the State which we described as fair and 
<A NAME="809"></A>spangled. And many a man and many a woman will take him for their pattern, 
<A NAME="810"></A>and many a constitution and many an example of manners is contained in 
<A NAME="811"></A>him.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR><BR>Just so.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>Let him then be set over against democracy; he may truly be called 
<A NAME="814"></A>the democratic man.
<A NAME="815"></A><BR><BR>Let that be his place, he said.
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>Last of all comes the most beautiful of all, man and State alike, tyranny 
<A NAME="817"></A>and the tyrant; these we have now to consider.
<A NAME="818"></A><BR><BR>Quite true, he said.
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>Say then, my friend, in what manner does tyranny arise? --that it has 
<A NAME="820"></A>a democratic origin is evident.
<A NAME="821"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>And does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as democracy 
<A NAME="823"></A>from oligarchy --I mean, after a sort?
<A NAME="824"></A><BR><BR>How?
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>The good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which 
<A NAME="826"></A>it was maintained was excess of wealth --am I not right?
<A NAME="827"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>And the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things 
<A NAME="829"></A>for the sake of money-getting was also the ruin of oligarchy?
<A NAME="830"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>And democracy has her own good, of which the insatiable desire brings 
<A NAME="832"></A>her to dissolution?
<A NAME="833"></A><BR><BR>What good?
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>Freedom, I replied; which, as they tell you in a democracy, is the 
<A NAME="835"></A>glory of the State --and that therefore in a democracy alone will the freeman 
<A NAME="836"></A>of nature deign to dwell.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR><BR>Yes; the saying is in everybody's mouth.
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>I was going to observe, that the insatiable desire of this and the 
<A NAME="839"></A>neglect of other things introduces the change in democracy, which occasions 
<A NAME="840"></A>a demand for tyranny.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR><BR>How so?
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>When a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cupbearers 
<A NAME="843"></A>presiding over the feast, and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine of 
<A NAME="844"></A>freedom, then, unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful 
<A NAME="845"></A>draught, she calls them to account and punishes them, and says that they 
<A NAME="846"></A>are cursed oligarchs.
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he replied, a very common occurrence.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>Yes, I said; and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves 
<A NAME="849"></A>who hug their chains and men of naught; she would have subjects who are 
<A NAME="850"></A>like rulers, and rulers who are like subjects: these are men after her 
<A NAME="851"></A>own heart, whom she praises and honours both in private and public. Now, 
<A NAME="852"></A>in such a State, can liberty have any limit?
<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>By degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses, and ends by 
<A NAME="855"></A>getting among the animals and infecting them.
<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR>How do you mean?
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>I mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of 
<A NAME="858"></A>his sons and to fear them, and the son is on a level with his father, he 
<A NAME="859"></A>having no respect or reverence for either of his parents; and this is his 
<A NAME="860"></A>freedom, and metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen with the metic, 
<A NAME="861"></A>and the stranger is quite as good as either.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that is the way.
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>And these are not the only evils, I said --there are several lesser 
<A NAME="864"></A>ones: In such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars, 
<A NAME="865"></A>and the scholars despise their masters and tutors; young and old are all 
<A NAME="866"></A>alike; and the young man is on a level with the old, and is ready to compete 
<A NAME="867"></A>with him in word or deed; and old men condescend to the young and are full 
<A NAME="868"></A>of pleasantry and gaiety; they are loth to be thought morose and authoritative, 
<A NAME="869"></A>and therefore they adopt the manners of the young.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR>Quite true, he said.
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>The last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with money, 
<A NAME="872"></A>whether male or female, is just as free as his or her purchaser; nor must 
<A NAME="873"></A>I forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes in relation 
<A NAME="874"></A>to each other.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR><BR>Why not, as Aeschylus says, utter the word which rises to our 
<A NAME="876"></A>lips?
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>That is what I am doing, I replied; and I must add that no one who 
<A NAME="878"></A>does not know would believe, how much greater is the liberty which the 
<A NAME="879"></A>animals who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in any 
<A NAME="880"></A>other State: for truly, the she-dogs, as the proverb says, are as good 
<A NAME="881"></A>as their she-mistresses, and the horses and asses have a way of marching 
<A NAME="882"></A>along with all the rights and dignities of freemen; and they will run at 
<A NAME="883"></A>anybody who comes in their way if he does not leave the road clear for 
<A NAME="884"></A>them: and all things are just ready to burst with liberty.
<A NAME="885"></A><BR><BR>When I take a country walk, he said, I often experience what you 
<A NAME="886"></A>describe. You and I have dreamed the same thing.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR><BR>And above all, I said, and as the result of all, see how sensitive 
<A NAME="888"></A>the citizens become; they chafe impatiently at the least touch of authority 
<A NAME="889"></A>and at length, as you know, they cease to care even for the laws, written 
<A NAME="890"></A>or unwritten; they will have no one over them.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, I know it too well.
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>Such, my friend, I said, is the fair and glorious beginning out of 
<A NAME="893"></A>which springs tyranny.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR><BR>Glorious indeed, he said. But what is the next 
<A NAME="895"></A>step?
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; the same disease magnified 
<A NAME="897"></A>and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy --the truth being that 
<A NAME="898"></A>the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in the opposite 
<A NAME="899"></A>direction; and this is the case not only in the seasons and in vegetable 
<A NAME="900"></A>and animal life, but above all in forms of government.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>The excess of liberty, whether in States or individuals, seems only 
<A NAME="903"></A>to pass into excess of slavery.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR><BR>Yes, the natural order.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>And so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated 
<A NAME="906"></A>form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of 
<A NAME="907"></A>liberty?
<A NAME="908"></A><BR><BR>As we might expect.
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>That, however, was not, as I believe, your question-you rather desired 
<A NAME="910"></A>to know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and 
<A NAME="911"></A>democracy, and is the ruin of both?
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR>Just so, he replied.
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>Well, I said, I meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts, of 
<A NAME="914"></A>whom the more courageous are the-leaders and the more timid the followers, 
<A NAME="915"></A>the same whom we were comparing to drones, some stingless, and others having 
<A NAME="916"></A>stings.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR>A very just comparison.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>These two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are generated, 
<A NAME="919"></A>being what phlegm and bile are to the body. And the good physician and 
<A NAME="920"></A>lawgiver of the State ought, like the wise bee-master, to keep them at 
<A NAME="921"></A>a distance and prevent, if possible, their ever coming in; and if they 
<A NAME="922"></A>have anyhow found a way in, then he should have them and their cells cut 
<A NAME="923"></A>out as speedily as possible.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR><BR>Yes, by all means, he said.
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>Then, in order that we may see clearly what we are doing, let us imagine 
<A NAME="926"></A>democracy to be divided, as indeed it is, into three classes; for in the 
<A NAME="927"></A>first place freedom creates rather more drones in the democratic than there 
<A NAME="928"></A>were in the oligarchical State.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>And in the democracy they are certainly more intensified.
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>How so?
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>Because in the oligarchical State they are disqualified and driven 
<A NAME="933"></A>from office, and therefore they cannot train or gather strength; whereas 
<A NAME="934"></A>in a democracy they are almost the entire ruling power, and while the keener 
<A NAME="935"></A>sort speak and act, the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do not suffer 
<A NAME="936"></A>a word to be said on the other side; hence in democracies almost everything 
<A NAME="937"></A>is managed by the drones.
<A NAME="938"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>Then there is another class which is always being severed from the 
<A NAME="940"></A>mass.
<A NAME="941"></A><BR><BR>What is that?
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>They are the orderly class, which in a nation of traders sure to be 
<A NAME="943"></A>the richest.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR><BR>Naturally so.
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>They are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount of 
<A NAME="946"></A>honey to the drones.
<A NAME="947"></A><BR><BR>Why, he said, there is little to be squeezed out of people who 
<A NAME="948"></A>have little.
<A NAME="949"></A><BR><BR>And this is called the wealthy class, and the drones feed upon 
<A NAME="950"></A>them.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>That is pretty much the case, he said.
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>The people are a third class, consisting of those who work with their 
<A NAME="953"></A>own hands; they are not politicians, and have not much to live upon. This, 
<A NAME="954"></A>when assembled, is the largest and most powerful class in a 
<A NAME="955"></A>democracy.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR>True, he said; but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate 
<A NAME="957"></A>unless they get a little honey.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR><BR>And do they not share? I said. Do not their leaders deprive the 
<A NAME="959"></A>rich of their estates and distribute them among the people; at the same 
<A NAME="960"></A>time taking care to reserve the larger part for themselves?
<A NAME="961"></A><BR><BR>Why, yes, he said, to that extent the people do 
<A NAME="962"></A>share.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>And the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to 
<A NAME="964"></A>defend themselves before the people as they best can?
<A NAME="965"></A><BR><BR>What else can they do?
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>And then, although they may have no desire of change, the others charge 
<A NAME="967"></A>them with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy? 
<A NAME="968"></A>True.
<A NAME="969"></A><BR><BR>And the end is that when they see the people, not of their own 
<A NAME="970"></A>accord, but through ignorance, and because they are deceived by informers, 
<A NAME="971"></A>seeking to do them wrong, then at last they are forced to become oligarchs 
<A NAME="972"></A>in reality; they do not wish to be, but the sting of the drones torments 
<A NAME="973"></A>them and breeds revolution in them.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR><BR>That is exactly the truth.
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>Then come impeachments and judgments and trials of one 
<A NAME="976"></A>another.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>The people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse 
<A NAME="979"></A>into greatness.
<A NAME="980"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that is their way.
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he 
<A NAME="982"></A>first appears above ground he is a protector.
<A NAME="983"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that is quite clear.
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>How then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant? Clearly when 
<A NAME="985"></A>he does what the man is said to do in the tale of the Arcadian temple of 
<A NAME="986"></A>Lycaean Zeus.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR><BR>What tale?
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>The tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human victim 
<A NAME="989"></A>minced up with the entrails of other victims is destined to become a wolf. 
<A NAME="990"></A>Did you never hear it?
<A NAME="991"></A><BR><BR>Oh, yes.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>And the protector of the people is like him; having a mob entirely 
<A NAME="993"></A>at his disposal, he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen; 
<A NAME="994"></A>by the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court and 
<A NAME="995"></A>murders them, making the life of man to disappear, and with unholy tongue 
<A NAME="996"></A>and lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizen; some he kills and others 
<A NAME="997"></A>he banishes, at the same time hinting at the abolition of debts and partition 
<A NAME="998"></A>of lands: and after this, what will be his destiny? Must he not either 
<A NAME="999"></A>perish at the hands of his enemies, or from being a man become a wolf --that 
<A NAME="1000"></A>is, a tyrant?
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR><BR>Inevitably.
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>This, I said, is he who begins to make a party against the 
<A NAME="1003"></A>rich?
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>The same.
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>After a while he is driven out, but comes back, in spite of his enemies, 
<A NAME="1006"></A>a tyrant full grown.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR><BR>That is clear.
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>And if they are unable to expel him, or to get him condemned to death 
<A NAME="1009"></A>by a public accusation, they conspire to assassinate 
<A NAME="1010"></A>him.
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that is their usual way.
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>Then comes the famous request for a bodyguard, which is the device 
<A NAME="1013"></A>of all those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career --'Let not 
<A NAME="1014"></A>the people's friend,' as they say, 'be lost to them.'
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>The people readily assent; all their fears are for him --they have 
<A NAME="1017"></A>none for themselves.
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>And when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy 
<A NAME="1020"></A>of the people sees this, then, my friend, as the oracle said to 
<A NAME="1021"></A>Croesus,
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR><BR>By pebbly Hermus' shore he flees and rests not and is not ashamed 
<A NAME="1023"></A>to be a coward.
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR><BR>And quite right too, said he, for if he were, he would never be 
<A NAME="1025"></A>ashamed again.
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR><BR>But if he is caught he dies.
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>And he, the protector of whom we spoke, is to be seen, not 'larding 
<A NAME="1029"></A>the plain' with his bulk, but himself the overthrower of many, standing 
<A NAME="1030"></A>up in the chariot of State with the reins in his hand, no longer protector, 
<A NAME="1031"></A>but tyrant absolute.
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR><BR>No doubt, he said.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>And now let us consider the happiness of the man, and also of the State 
<A NAME="1034"></A>in which a creature like him is generated.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, let us consider that.
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>At first, in the early days of his power, he is full of smiles, and 
<A NAME="1037"></A>he salutes every one whom he meets; --he to be called a tyrant, who is 
<A NAME="1038"></A>making promises in public and also in private! liberating debtors, and 
<A NAME="1039"></A>distributing land to the people and his followers, and wanting to be so 
<A NAME="1040"></A>kind and good to every one!
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR><BR>Of course, he said.
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>But when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty, 
<A NAME="1043"></A>and there is nothing to fear from them, then he is always stirring up some 
<A NAME="1044"></A>war or other, in order that the people may require a 
<A NAME="1045"></A>leader.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR><BR>To be sure.
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>Has he not also another object, which is that they may be impoverished 
<A NAME="1048"></A>by payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves to their daily 
<A NAME="1049"></A>wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him? 
<A NAME="1050"></A>Clearly.
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR><BR>And if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom, 
<A NAME="1052"></A>and of resistance to his authority, he will have a good pretext for destroying 
<A NAME="1053"></A>them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy; and for all these reasons 
<A NAME="1054"></A>the tyrant must be always getting up a war.
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR><BR>He must.
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>Now he begins to grow unpopular.
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>A necessary result.
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>Then some of those who joined in setting him up, and who are in power, 
<A NAME="1059"></A>speak their minds to him and to one another, and the more courageous of 
<A NAME="1060"></A>them cast in his teeth what is being done.
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that may be expected.
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>And the tyrant, if he means to rule, must get rid of them; he cannot 
<A NAME="1063"></A>stop while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for 
<A NAME="1064"></A>anything.
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR><BR>He cannot.
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>And therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant, who is 
<A NAME="1067"></A>high-minded, who is wise, who is wealthy; happy man, he is the enemy of 
<A NAME="1068"></A>them all, and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no, until 
<A NAME="1069"></A>he has made a purgation of the State.
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, and a rare purgation.
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>Yes, I said, not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of 
<A NAME="1072"></A>the body; for they take away the worse and leave the better part, but he 
<A NAME="1073"></A>does the reverse.
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR><BR>If he is to rule, I suppose that he cannot help 
<A NAME="1075"></A>himself.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>What a blessed alternative, I said: --to be compelled to dwell only 
<A NAME="1077"></A>with the many bad, and to be by them hated, or not to live at 
<A NAME="1078"></A>all!
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that is the alternative.
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>And the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more satellites 
<A NAME="1081"></A>and the greater devotion in them will he require?
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>And who are the devoted band, and where will he procure 
<A NAME="1084"></A>them?
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>They will flock to him, he said, of their own accord, if lie pays 
<A NAME="1086"></A>them.
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR><BR>By the dog! I said, here are more drones, of every sort and from 
<A NAME="1088"></A>every land.
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, there are.
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>But will he not desire to get them on the spot?
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>How do you mean?
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>He will rob the citizens of their slaves; he will then set them free 
<A NAME="1093"></A>and enrol them in his bodyguard.
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR><BR>To be sure, he said; and he will be able to trust them best of 
<A NAME="1095"></A>all.
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>What a blessed creature, I said, must this tyrant be; he has put to 
<A NAME="1097"></A>death the others and has these for his trusted friends.
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; they are quite of his sort.
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>Yes, I said, and these are the new citizens whom he has called into 
<A NAME="1100"></A>existence, who admire him and are his companions, while the good hate and 
<A NAME="1101"></A>avoid him.
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>Verily, then, tragedy is a wise thing and Euripides a great 
<A NAME="1104"></A>tragedian.
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR><BR>Why so?
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>Why, because he is the author of the pregnant saying,
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR><BR>Tyrants are wise by living with the wise; and he clearly meant 
<A NAME="1108"></A>to say that they are the wise whom the tyrant makes his 
<A NAME="1109"></A>companions.
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, and he also praises tyranny as godlike; and many 
<A NAME="1111"></A>other things of the same kind are said by him and by the other 
<A NAME="1112"></A>poets.
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR><BR>And therefore, I said, the tragic poets being wise men will forgive 
<A NAME="1114"></A>us and any others who live after our manner if we do not receive them into 
<A NAME="1115"></A>our State, because they are the eulogists of tyranny.
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, those who have the wit will doubtless forgive 
<A NAME="1117"></A>us.
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>But they will continue to go to other cities and attract mobs, and 
<A NAME="1119"></A>hire voices fair and loud and persuasive, and draw the cities over to tyrannies 
<A NAME="1120"></A>and democracies.
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>Moreover, they are paid for this and receive honour --the greatest 
<A NAME="1123"></A>honour, as might be expected, from tyrants, and the next greatest from 
<A NAME="1124"></A>democracies; but the higher they ascend our constitution hill, the more 
<A NAME="1125"></A>their reputation fails, and seems unable from shortness of breath to proceed 
<A NAME="1126"></A>further.
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>But we are wandering from the subject: Let us therefore return and 
<A NAME="1129"></A>enquire how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various 
<A NAME="1130"></A>and ever-changing army of his.
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR><BR>If, he said, there are sacred treasures in the city, he will confiscate 
<A NAME="1132"></A>and spend them; and in so far as the fortunes of attainted persons may 
<A NAME="1133"></A>suffice, he will be able to diminish the taxes which he would otherwise 
<A NAME="1134"></A>have to impose upon the people.
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR><BR>And when these fail?
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>Why, clearly, he said, then he and his boon companions, whether male 
<A NAME="1137"></A>or female, will be maintained out of his father's estate.
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR><BR>You mean to say that the people, from whom he has derived his being, 
<A NAME="1139"></A>will maintain him and his companions?
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; they cannot help themselves.
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR>But what if the people fly into a passion, and aver that a grown-up 
<A NAME="1142"></A>son ought not to be supported by his father, but that the father should 
<A NAME="1143"></A>be supported by the son? The father did not bring him into being, or settle 
<A NAME="1144"></A>him in life, in order that when his son became a man he should himself 
<A NAME="1145"></A>be the servant of his own servants and should support him and his rabble 
<A NAME="1146"></A>of slaves and companions; but that his son should protect him, and that 
<A NAME="1147"></A>by his help he might be emancipated from the government of the rich and 
<A NAME="1148"></A>aristocratic, as they are termed. And so he bids him and his companions 
<A NAME="1149"></A>depart, just as any other father might drive out of the house a riotous 
<A NAME="1150"></A>son and his undesirable associates.
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR><BR>By heaven, he said, then the parent will discover what a monster 
<A NAME="1152"></A>he has been fostering in his bosom; and, when he wants to drive him out, 
<A NAME="1153"></A>he will find that he is weak and his son strong.
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR><BR>Why, you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence? 
<A NAME="1155"></A>What! beat his father if he opposes him?
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he will, having first disarmed him.
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR>Then he is a parricide, and a cruel guardian of an aged parent; and 
<A NAME="1158"></A>this is real tyranny, about which there can be no longer a mistake: as 
<A NAME="1159"></A>the saying is, the people who would escape the smoke which is the slavery 
<A NAME="1160"></A>of freemen, has fallen into the fire which is the tyranny of slaves. Thus 
<A NAME="1161"></A>liberty, getting out of all order and reason, passes into the harshest 
<A NAME="1162"></A>and bitterest form of slavery.
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR>Very well; and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently discussed 
<A NAME="1165"></A>the nature of tyranny, and the manner of the transition from democracy 
<A NAME="1166"></A>to tyranny?
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR><BR>Yes, quite enough, he said.
