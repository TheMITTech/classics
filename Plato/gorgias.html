<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR><B>Callicles.</B> The wise man, as the proverb says, is late for 
<A NAME="18"></A>a fray, but not for a feast.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR><B>Socrates.</B> And are we late for a feast?
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR><B>Cal.</B> Yes, and a delightful feast; for Gorgias has just been 
<A NAME="21"></A>exhibiting to us many fine things.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> It is not my fault, Callicles; our friend Chaerephon 
<A NAME="23"></A>is to blame; for he would keep us loitering in the Agora.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR><B>Chaerephon.</B> Never mind, Socrates; the misfortune of which 
<A NAME="25"></A>I have been the cause I will also repair; for Gorgias is a friend of mine, 
<A NAME="26"></A>and I will make him give the exhibition again either now, or, if you prefer, 
<A NAME="27"></A>at some other time.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR><B>Cal.</B> What is the matter, Chaerephon-does Socrates want to 
<A NAME="29"></A>hear Gorgias?
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR><B>Chaer.</B> Yes, that was our intention in 
<A NAME="31"></A>coming.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR><B>Cal.</B> Come into my house, then; for Gorgias is staying with 
<A NAME="33"></A>me, and he shall exhibit to you.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Very good, Callicles; but will he answer our questions? 
<A NAME="35"></A>for I want to hear from him what is the nature of his art, and what it 
<A NAME="36"></A>is which he professes and teaches; he may, as you [Chaerephon] suggest, 
<A NAME="37"></A>defer the exhibition to some other time.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR><B>Cal.</B> There is nothing like asking him, Socrates; and indeed 
<A NAME="39"></A>to answer questions is a part of his exhibition, for he was saying only 
<A NAME="40"></A>just now, that any one in my house might put any question to him, and that 
<A NAME="41"></A>he would answer.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> How fortunate! will you ask him, 
<A NAME="43"></A>Chaerephon-?
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR><B>Chaer.</B> What shall I ask him?
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Ask him who he is.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR><B>Chaer.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I mean such a question as would elicit from him, if 
<A NAME="48"></A>he had been a maker of shoes, the answer that he is a cobbler. Do you 
<A NAME="49"></A>understand?
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR><B>Chaer.</B> I understand, and will ask him: Tell me, Gorgias, 
<A NAME="51"></A>is our friend Callicles right in saying that you undertake to answer any 
<A NAME="52"></A>questions which you are asked?
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR><B>Gorgias.</B> Quite right, Chaerephon: I was saying as much only 
<A NAME="54"></A>just now; and I may add, that many years have elapsed since any one has 
<A NAME="55"></A>asked me a new one.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR><B>Chaer.</B> Then you must be very ready, Gorgias.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Of that, Chaerephon, you can make 
<A NAME="58"></A>trial.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR><B>Polus.</B> Yes, indeed, and if you like, Chaerephon, you may 
<A NAME="60"></A>make trial of me too, for I think that Gorgias, who has been talking a 
<A NAME="61"></A>long time, is tired.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR><B>Chaer.</B> And do you, Polus, think that you can answer better 
<A NAME="63"></A>than Gorgias?
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> What does that matter if I answer well enough for 
<A NAME="65"></A>you?
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR><B>Chaer.</B> Not at all:-and you shall answer if you 
<A NAME="67"></A>like.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Ask:-
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR><B>Chaer.</B> My question is this: If Gorgias had the skill of 
<A NAME="70"></A>his brother Herodicus, what ought we to call him? Ought he not to have 
<A NAME="71"></A>the name which is given to his brother?
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR><B>Chaer.</B> Then we should be right in calling him a 
<A NAME="74"></A>physician?
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR><B>Chaer.</B> And if he had the skill of Aristophon the son of 
<A NAME="77"></A>Aglaophon, or of his brother Polygnotus, what ought we to call 
<A NAME="78"></A>him?
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Clearly, a painter.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR><B>Chaer.</B> But now what shall we call him-what is the art in 
<A NAME="81"></A>which he is skilled.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> O Chaerephon, there are many arts among mankind which 
<A NAME="83"></A>are experimental, and have their origin in experience, for experience makes 
<A NAME="84"></A>the days of men to proceed according to art, and inexperience according 
<A NAME="85"></A>to chance, and different persons in different ways are proficient in different 
<A NAME="86"></A>arts, and the best persons in the best arts. And our friend Gorgias is 
<A NAME="87"></A>one of the best, and the art in which he is a proficient is the 
<A NAME="88"></A>noblest.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Polus has been taught how to make a capital speech, 
<A NAME="90"></A>Gorgias; but he is not fulfilling the promise which he made to 
<A NAME="91"></A>Chaerephon.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> What do you mean, Socrates?
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I mean that he has not exactly answered the question 
<A NAME="94"></A>which he was asked.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Then why not ask him yourself?
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But I would much rather ask you, if you are disposed 
<A NAME="97"></A>to answer: for I see, from the few words which Polus has uttered, that 
<A NAME="98"></A>he has attended more to the art which is called rhetoric than to 
<A NAME="99"></A>dialectic.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> What makes you say so, Socrates?
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Because, Polus, when Chaerephon asked you what was 
<A NAME="102"></A>the art which Gorgias knows, you praised it as if you were answering some 
<A NAME="103"></A>one who found fault with it, but you never said what the art 
<A NAME="104"></A>was.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Why, did I not say that it was the noblest of 
<A NAME="106"></A>arts?
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, indeed, but that was no answer to the question: 
<A NAME="108"></A>nobody asked what was the quality, but what was the nature, of the art, 
<A NAME="109"></A>and by what name we were to describe Gorgias. And I would still beg you 
<A NAME="110"></A>briefly and clearly, as you answered Chaerephon when he asked you at first, 
<A NAME="111"></A>to say what this art is, and what we ought to call Gorgias: Or rather, 
<A NAME="112"></A>Gorgias, let me turn to you, and ask the same question what are we to call 
<A NAME="113"></A>you, and what is the art which you profess?
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Rhetoric, Socrates, is my art.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then I am to call you a rhetorician?
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes, Socrates, and a good one too, if you would call 
<A NAME="117"></A>me that which, in Homeric language, "I boast myself to 
<A NAME="118"></A>be."
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I should wish to do so.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Then pray do.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And are we to say that you are able to make other men 
<A NAME="122"></A>rhetoricians?
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes, that is exactly what I profess to make them, not 
<A NAME="124"></A>only at Athens, but in all places.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And will you continue to ask and answer questions, 
<A NAME="126"></A>Gorgias, as we are at present doing and reserve for another occasion the 
<A NAME="127"></A>longer mode of speech which Polus was attempting? Will you keep your promise, 
<A NAME="128"></A>and answer shortly the questions which are asked of 
<A NAME="129"></A>you?
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Some answers, Socrates, are of necessity longer; but 
<A NAME="131"></A>I will do my best to make them as short as possible; for a part of my profession 
<A NAME="132"></A>is that I can be as short as any one.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That is what is wanted, Gorgias; exhibit the shorter 
<A NAME="134"></A>method now, and the longer one at some other time.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Well, I will; and you will certainly say, that you 
<A NAME="136"></A>never heard a man use fewer words.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Very good then; as you profess to be a rhetorician, 
<A NAME="138"></A>and a maker of rhetoricians, let me ask you, with what is rhetoric concerned: 
<A NAME="139"></A>I might ask with what is weaving concerned, and you would reply (would 
<A NAME="140"></A>you not?), with the making of garments?
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And music is concerned with the composition of 
<A NAME="143"></A>melodies?
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> It is.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> By Here, Gorgias, I admire the surpassing brevity of 
<A NAME="146"></A>your answers.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes, Socrates, I do think myself good at 
<A NAME="148"></A>that.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I am glad to hear it; answer me in like manner about 
<A NAME="150"></A>rhetoric: with what is rhetoric concerned?
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> With discourse.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What sort of discourse, Gorgias?-such discourse as 
<A NAME="153"></A>would teach the sick under what treatment they might get 
<A NAME="154"></A>well?
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> No.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then rhetoric does not treat of all kinds of 
<A NAME="157"></A>discourse?
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And yet rhetoric makes men able to 
<A NAME="160"></A>speak?
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And to understand that about which they 
<A NAME="163"></A>speak?
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But does not the art of medicine, which we were just 
<A NAME="166"></A>now mentioning, also make men able to understand and speak about the 
<A NAME="167"></A>sick?
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then medicine also treats of discourse?
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Of discourse concerning diseases?
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Just so.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And does not gymnastic also treat of discourse concerning 
<A NAME="174"></A>the good or evil condition of the body?
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the same, Gorgias, is true of the other arts:-all 
<A NAME="177"></A>of them treat of discourse concerning the subjects with which they severally 
<A NAME="178"></A>have to do.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Clearly.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then why, if you call rhetoric the art which treats 
<A NAME="181"></A>of discourse, and all the other arts treat of discourse, do you not call 
<A NAME="182"></A>them arts of rhetoric?
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Because, Socrates, the knowledge of the other arts 
<A NAME="184"></A>has only to do with some sort of external action, as of the hand; but there 
<A NAME="185"></A>is no such action of the hand in rhetoric which works and takes effect 
<A NAME="186"></A>only through the medium of discourse. And therefore I am justified in saying 
<A NAME="187"></A>that rhetoric treats of discourse.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I am not sure whether I entirely understand you, but 
<A NAME="189"></A>I dare say I shall soon know better; please to answer me a question:-you 
<A NAME="190"></A>would allow that there are arts?
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> As to the arts generally, they are for the most part 
<A NAME="193"></A>concerned with doing, and require little or no speaking; in painting, and 
<A NAME="194"></A>statuary, and many other arts, the work may proceed in silence; and of 
<A NAME="195"></A>such arts I suppose you would say that they do not come within the province 
<A NAME="196"></A>of rhetoric.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> You perfectly conceive my meaning, 
<A NAME="198"></A>Socrates.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But there are other arts which work wholly through 
<A NAME="200"></A>the medium of language, and require either no action or very little, as, 
<A NAME="201"></A>for example, the arts of arithmetic, of calculation, of geometry, and of 
<A NAME="202"></A>playing draughts; in some of these speech is pretty nearly co-extensive 
<A NAME="203"></A>with action, but in most of them the verbal element is greater-they depend 
<A NAME="204"></A>wholly on words for their efficacy and power: and I take your meaning to 
<A NAME="205"></A>be that rhetoric is an art of this latter sort?
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Exactly.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And yet I do not believe that you really mean to call 
<A NAME="208"></A>any of these arts rhetoric; although the precise expression which you used 
<A NAME="209"></A>was, that rhetoric is an art which works and takes effect only through 
<A NAME="210"></A>the medium of discourse; and an adversary who wished to be captious might 
<A NAME="211"></A>say, "And so, Gorgias, you call arithmetic rhetoric." But I do not think 
<A NAME="212"></A>that you really call arithmetic rhetoric any more than geometry would be 
<A NAME="213"></A>so called by you.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> You are quite right, Socrates, in your apprehension 
<A NAME="215"></A>of my meaning.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, then, let me now have the rest of my answer:-seeing 
<A NAME="217"></A>that rhetoric is one of those arts which works mainly by the use of words, 
<A NAME="218"></A>and there are other arts which also use words, tell me what is that quality 
<A NAME="219"></A>in words with which rhetoric is concerned:-Suppose that a person asks me 
<A NAME="220"></A>about some of the arts which I was mentioning just now; he might say, "Socrates, 
<A NAME="221"></A>what is arithmetic?" and I should reply to him, as you replied to me, that 
<A NAME="222"></A>arithmetic is one of those arts which take effect through words. And then 
<A NAME="223"></A>he would proceed to ask: "Words about what?" and I should reply, Words 
<A NAME="224"></A>about and even numbers, and how many there are of each. And if he asked 
<A NAME="225"></A>again: "What is the art of calculation?" I should say, That also is one 
<A NAME="226"></A>of the arts which is concerned wholly with words. And if he further said, 
<A NAME="227"></A>"Concerned with what?" I should say, like the clerks in the assembly, "as 
<A NAME="228"></A>aforesaid" of arithmetic, but with a difference, the difference being that 
<A NAME="229"></A>the art of calculation considers not only the quantities of odd and even 
<A NAME="230"></A>numbers, but also their numerical relations to themselves and to one another. 
<A NAME="231"></A>And suppose, again, I were to say that astronomy is only word-he would 
<A NAME="232"></A>ask, "Words about what, Socrates?" and I should answer, that astronomy 
<A NAME="233"></A>tells us about the motions of the stars and sun and moon, and their relative 
<A NAME="234"></A>swiftness.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> You would be quite right, Socrates.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And now let us have from you, Gorgias, the truth about 
<A NAME="237"></A>rhetoric: which you would admit (would you not?) to be one of those arts 
<A NAME="238"></A>which act always and fulfil all their ends through the medium of 
<A NAME="239"></A>words?
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> True.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Words which do what? I should ask. To what class of 
<A NAME="242"></A>things do the words which rhetoric uses relate?
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> To the greatest, Socrates, and the best of human 
<A NAME="244"></A>things.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That again, Gorgias is ambiguous; I am still in the 
<A NAME="246"></A>dark: for which are the greatest and best of human things? I dare say that 
<A NAME="247"></A>you have heard men singing at feasts the old drinking song, in which the 
<A NAME="248"></A>singers enumerate the goods of life, first health, beauty next, thirdly, 
<A NAME="249"></A>as the writer of the song says, wealth honesty obtained.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes, I know the song; but what is your 
<A NAME="251"></A>drift?
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I mean to say, that the producers of those things which 
<A NAME="253"></A>the author of the song praises, that is to say, the physician, the trainer, 
<A NAME="254"></A>the money-maker, will at once come to you, and first the physician will 
<A NAME="255"></A>say: "O Socrates, Gorgias is deceiving you, for my art is concerned with 
<A NAME="256"></A>the greatest good of men and not his." And when I ask, Who are you? he 
<A NAME="257"></A>will reply, "I am a physician." What do you mean? I shall say. Do you mean 
<A NAME="258"></A>that your art produces the greatest good? "Certainly," he will answer, 
<A NAME="259"></A>"for is not health the greatest good? What greater good can men have, Socrates?" 
<A NAME="260"></A>And after him the trainer will come and say, "I too, Socrates, shall be 
<A NAME="261"></A>greatly surprised if Gorgias can show more good of his art than I can show 
<A NAME="262"></A>of mine." To him again I shall say, Who are you, honest friend, and what 
<A NAME="263"></A>is your business? "I am a trainer," he will reply, "and my business is 
<A NAME="264"></A>to make men beautiful and strong in body." When I have done with the trainer, 
<A NAME="265"></A>there arrives the money-maker, and he, as I expect, utterly despise them 
<A NAME="266"></A>all. "Consider Socrates," he will say, "whether Gorgias or any one-else 
<A NAME="267"></A>can produce any greater good than wealth." Well, you and I say to him, 
<A NAME="268"></A>and are you a creator of wealth? "Yes," he replies. And who are you? "A 
<A NAME="269"></A>money-maker." And do you consider wealth to be the greatest good of man? 
<A NAME="270"></A>"Of course," will be his reply. And we shall rejoin: Yes; but our friend 
<A NAME="271"></A>Gorgias contends that his art produces a greater good than yours. And then 
<A NAME="272"></A>he will be sure to go on and ask, "What good? Let Gorgias answer." Now 
<A NAME="273"></A>I want you, Gorgias, to imagine that this question is asked of you by them 
<A NAME="274"></A>and by me; What is that which, as you say, is the greatest good of man, 
<A NAME="275"></A>and of which you are the creator? Answer us.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> That good, Socrates, which is truly the greatest, being 
<A NAME="277"></A>that which gives to men freedom in their own persons, and to individuals 
<A NAME="278"></A>the power of ruling over others in their several states.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And what would you consider this to 
<A NAME="280"></A>be?
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> What is there greater than the word which persuades 
<A NAME="282"></A>the judges in the courts, or the senators in the council, or the citizens 
<A NAME="283"></A>in the assembly, or at any other political meeting?-if you have the power 
<A NAME="284"></A>of uttering this word, you will have the physician your slave, and the 
<A NAME="285"></A>trainer your slave, and the money-maker of whom you talk will be found 
<A NAME="286"></A>to gather treasures, not for himself, but for you who are able to speak 
<A NAME="287"></A>and to persuade the multitude.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Now I think, Gorgias, that you have very accurately 
<A NAME="289"></A>explained what you conceive to be the art of rhetoric; and you mean to 
<A NAME="290"></A>say, if I am not mistaken, that rhetoric is the artificer of persuasion, 
<A NAME="291"></A>having this and no other business, and that this is her crown and end. 
<A NAME="292"></A>Do you know any other effect of rhetoric over and above that of producing 
<A NAME="293"></A>persuasion?
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> No: the definition seems to me very fair, Socrates; 
<A NAME="295"></A>for persuasion is the chief end of rhetoric.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then hear me, Gorgias, for I am quite sure that if 
<A NAME="297"></A>there ever was a man who-entered on the discussion of a matter from a pure 
<A NAME="298"></A>love of knowing the truth, I am such a one, and I should say the same of 
<A NAME="299"></A>you.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> What is coming, Socrates?
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I will tell you: I am very well aware that do not know 
<A NAME="302"></A>what, according to you, is the exact nature, or what are the topics of 
<A NAME="303"></A>that persuasion of which you speak, and which is given by rhetoric; although 
<A NAME="304"></A>I have a suspicion about both the one and the other. And I am going to 
<A NAME="305"></A>ask-what is this power of persuasion which is given by rhetoric, and about 
<A NAME="306"></A>what? But why, if I have a suspicion, do I ask instead of telling you? 
<A NAME="307"></A>Not for your sake, but in order that the argument may proceed in such a 
<A NAME="308"></A>manner as is most likely to set forth the truth. And I would have you observe, 
<A NAME="309"></A>that I am right in asking this further question: If I asked, "What sort 
<A NAME="310"></A>of a painter is Zeuxis?" and you said, "The painter of figures," should 
<A NAME="311"></A>I not be right in asking, What kind of figures, and where do you find 
<A NAME="312"></A>them?"
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the reason for asking this second question would 
<A NAME="315"></A>be, that there are other painters besides, who paint many other 
<A NAME="316"></A>figures?
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> True.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But if there had been no one but Zeuxis who painted 
<A NAME="319"></A>them, then you would have answered very well?
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Quite so.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Now I was it to know about rhetoric in the same way;-is 
<A NAME="322"></A>rhetoric the only art which brings persuasion, or do other arts have the 
<A NAME="323"></A>same effect? I mean to say-Does he who teaches anything persuade men of 
<A NAME="324"></A>that which he teaches or not?
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> He persuades, Socrates,-there can be no mistake about 
<A NAME="326"></A>that.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Again, if we take the arts of which we were just now 
<A NAME="328"></A>speaking:-do not arithmetic and the arithmeticians teach us the properties 
<A NAME="329"></A>of number?
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And therefore persuade us of them?
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then arithmetic as well as rhetoric is an artificer 
<A NAME="334"></A>of persuasion?
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Clearly.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if any one asks us what sort of persuasion, and 
<A NAME="337"></A>about what,-we shall answer, persuasion which teaches the quantity of odd 
<A NAME="338"></A>and even; and we shall be able to show that all the other arts of which 
<A NAME="339"></A>we were just now speaking are artificers of persuasion, and of what sort, 
<A NAME="340"></A>and about what.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then rhetoric is not the only artificer of 
<A NAME="343"></A>persuasion?
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> True.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Seeing, then, that not only rhetoric works by persuasion, 
<A NAME="346"></A>but that other arts do the same, as in the case of the painter, a question 
<A NAME="347"></A>has arisen which is a very fair one: Of what persuasion is rhetoric the 
<A NAME="348"></A>artificer, and about what?-is not that a fair way of putting the 
<A NAME="349"></A>question?
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> I think so.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, if you approve the question, Gorgias, what is 
<A NAME="352"></A>the answer?
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> I answer, Socrates, that rhetoric is the art of persuasion 
<A NAME="354"></A>in courts of law and other assemblies, as I was just now saying, and about 
<A NAME="355"></A>the just and unjust.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And that, Gorgias, was what I was suspecting to be 
<A NAME="357"></A>your notion; yet I would not have you wonder if by-and-by I am found repeating 
<A NAME="358"></A>a seemingly plain question; for I ask not in order to confute you, but 
<A NAME="359"></A>as I was saying that the argument may proceed consecutively, and that we 
<A NAME="360"></A>may not get the habit of anticipating and suspecting the meaning of one 
<A NAME="361"></A>another's words; I would have you develop your own views in your own way, 
<A NAME="362"></A>whatever may be your hypothesis.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> I think that you are quite right, 
<A NAME="364"></A>Socrates.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then let me raise another question; there is such a 
<A NAME="366"></A>thing as "having learned"?
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And there is also "having believed"?
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is the "having learned" the same "having believed," 
<A NAME="371"></A>and are learning and belief the same things?
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> In my judgment, Socrates, they are not the 
<A NAME="373"></A>same.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And your judgment is right, as you may ascertain in 
<A NAME="375"></A>this way:-If a person were to say to you, "Is there, Gorgias, a false belief 
<A NAME="376"></A>as well as a true?" -you would reply, if I am not mistaken, that there 
<A NAME="377"></A>is.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, but is there a false knowledge as well as a 
<A NAME="380"></A>true?
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> No.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> No, indeed; and this again proves that knowledge and 
<A NAME="383"></A>belief differ.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And yet those who have learned as well as those who 
<A NAME="386"></A>have believed are persuaded?
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Just so.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Shall we then assume two sorts of persuasion,-one which 
<A NAME="389"></A>is the source of belief without knowledge, as the other is of 
<A NAME="390"></A>knowledge?
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And which sort of persuasion does rhetoric create in 
<A NAME="393"></A>courts of law and other assemblies about the just and unjust, the sort 
<A NAME="394"></A>of persuasion which gives belief without knowledge, or that which gives 
<A NAME="395"></A>knowledge?
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Clearly, Socrates, that which only gives 
<A NAME="397"></A>belief.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then rhetoric, as would appear, is the artificer of 
<A NAME="399"></A>a persuasion which creates belief about the just and unjust, but gives 
<A NAME="400"></A>no instruction about them?
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> True.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the rhetorician does not instruct the courts of 
<A NAME="403"></A>law or other assemblies about things just and unjust, but he creates belief 
<A NAME="404"></A>about them; for no one can be supposed to instruct such a vast multitude 
<A NAME="405"></A>about such high matters in a short time?
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Come, then, and let us see what we really mean about 
<A NAME="408"></A>rhetoric; for I do not know what my own meaning is as yet. When the assembly 
<A NAME="409"></A>meets to elect a physician or a shipwright or any other craftsman, will 
<A NAME="410"></A>the rhetorician be taken into counsel? Surely not. For at every election 
<A NAME="411"></A>he ought to be chosen who is most skilled; and, again, when walls have 
<A NAME="412"></A>to be built or harbours or docks to be constructed, not the rhetorician 
<A NAME="413"></A>but the master workman will advise; or when generals have to be chosen 
<A NAME="414"></A>and an order of battle arranged, or a proposition taken, then the military 
<A NAME="415"></A>will advise and not the rhetoricians: what do you say, Gorgias? Since you 
<A NAME="416"></A>profess to be a rhetorician and a maker of rhetoricians, I cannot do better 
<A NAME="417"></A>than learn the nature of your art from you. And here let me assure you 
<A NAME="418"></A>that I have your interest in view as well as my own. For likely enough 
<A NAME="419"></A>some one or other of the young men present might desire to become your 
<A NAME="420"></A>pupil, and in fact I see some, and a good many too, who have this wish, 
<A NAME="421"></A>but they would be too modest to question you. And therefore when you are 
<A NAME="422"></A>interrogated by me, I would have you imagine that you are interrogated 
<A NAME="423"></A>by them. "What is the use of coming to you, Gorgias? they will say about 
<A NAME="424"></A>what will you teach us to advise the state?-about the just and unjust only, 
<A NAME="425"></A>or about those other things also which Socrates has just mentioned? How 
<A NAME="426"></A>will you answer them?
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> I like your way of leading us on, Socrates, and I will 
<A NAME="428"></A>endeavour to reveal to you the whole nature of rhetoric. You must have 
<A NAME="429"></A>heard, I think, that the docks and the walls of the Athenians and the plan 
<A NAME="430"></A>of the harbour were devised in accordance with the counsels, partly of 
<A NAME="431"></A>Themistocles, and partly of Pericles, and not at the suggestion of the 
<A NAME="432"></A>builders.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Such is the tradition, Gorgias, about Themistocles; 
<A NAME="434"></A>and I myself heard the speech of Pericles when he advised us about the 
<A NAME="435"></A>middle wall.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> And you will observe, Socrates, that when a decision 
<A NAME="437"></A>has to be given in such matters the rhetoricians are the advisers; they 
<A NAME="438"></A>are the men who win their point.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I had that in my admiring mind, Gorgias, when I asked 
<A NAME="440"></A>what is the nature of rhetoric, which always appears to me, when I look 
<A NAME="441"></A>at the matter in this way, to be a marvel of greatness.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> A marvel, indeed, Socrates, if you only knew how rhetoric 
<A NAME="443"></A>comprehends and holds under her sway all the inferior arts. Let me offer 
<A NAME="444"></A>you a striking example of this. On several occasions I have been with my 
<A NAME="445"></A>brother Herodicus or some other physician to see one of his patients, who 
<A NAME="446"></A>would not allow the physician to give him medicine, or apply a knife or 
<A NAME="447"></A>hot iron to him; and I have persuaded him to do for me what he would not 
<A NAME="448"></A>do for the physician just by the use of rhetoric. And I say that if a rhetorician 
<A NAME="449"></A>and a physician were to go to any city, and had there to argue in the Ecclesia 
<A NAME="450"></A>or any other assembly as to which of them should be elected state-physician, 
<A NAME="451"></A>the physician would have no chance; but he who could speak would be chosen 
<A NAME="452"></A>if he wished; and in a contest with a man of any other profession the rhetorician 
<A NAME="453"></A>more than any one would have the power of getting himself chosen, for he 
<A NAME="454"></A>can speak more persuasively to the multitude than any of them, and on any 
<A NAME="455"></A>subject. Such is the nature and power of the art of rhetoric And yet, Socrates, 
<A NAME="456"></A>rhetoric should be used like any other competitive art, not against everybody-the 
<A NAME="457"></A>rhetorician ought not to abuse his strength any more than a pugilist or 
<A NAME="458"></A>pancratiast or other master of fence; because he has powers which are more 
<A NAME="459"></A>than a match either for friend or enemy, he ought not therefore to strike, 
<A NAME="460"></A>stab, or slay his friends. Suppose a man to have been trained in the palestra 
<A NAME="461"></A>and to be a skilful boxer-he in the fulness of his strength goes and strikes 
<A NAME="462"></A>his father or mother or one of his familiars or friends; but that is no 
<A NAME="463"></A>reason why the trainers or fencing-masters should be held in detestation 
<A NAME="464"></A>or banished from the city-surely not. For they taught their art for a good 
<A NAME="465"></A>purpose, to be used against enemies and evil-doers, in self-defence not 
<A NAME="466"></A>in aggression, and others have perverted their instructions, and turned 
<A NAME="467"></A>to a bad use their own strength and skill. But not on this account are 
<A NAME="468"></A>the teachers bad, neither is the art in fault, or bad in itself; I should 
<A NAME="469"></A>rather say that those who make a bad use of the art are to blame. And the 
<A NAME="470"></A>same argument holds good of rhetoric; for the rhetorician can speak against 
<A NAME="471"></A>all men and upon any subject-in short, he can persuade the multitude better 
<A NAME="472"></A>than any other man of anything which he pleases, but he should not therefore 
<A NAME="473"></A>seek to defraud the physician or any other artist of his reputation merely 
<A NAME="474"></A>because he has the power; he ought to use rhetoric fairly, as he would 
<A NAME="475"></A>also use his athletic powers. And if after having become a rhetorician 
<A NAME="476"></A>he makes a bad use of his strength and skill, his instructor surely ought 
<A NAME="477"></A>not on that account to be held in detestation or banished. For he was intended 
<A NAME="478"></A>by his teacher to make a good use of his instructions, but he abuses them. 
<A NAME="479"></A>And therefore he is the person who ought to be held in detestation, banished, 
<A NAME="480"></A>and put to death, and not his instructor.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You, Gorgias, like myself, have had great experience 
<A NAME="482"></A>of disputations, and you must have observed, I think, that they do not 
<A NAME="483"></A>always terminate in mutual edification, or in the definition by either 
<A NAME="484"></A>party of the subjects which they are discussing; but disagreements are 
<A NAME="485"></A>apt to arise-somebody says that another has not spoken truly or clearly; 
<A NAME="486"></A>and then they get into a passion and begin to quarrel, both parties conceiving 
<A NAME="487"></A>that their opponents are arguing from personal feeling only and jealousy 
<A NAME="488"></A>of themselves, not from any interest in the question at issue. And sometimes 
<A NAME="489"></A>they will go on abusing one another until the company at last are quite 
<A NAME="490"></A>vexed at themselves for ever listening to such fellows. Why do I say this? 
<A NAME="491"></A>Why, because I cannot help feeling that you are now saying what is not 
<A NAME="492"></A>quite consistent or accordant with what you were saying at first about 
<A NAME="493"></A>rhetoric. And I am afraid to point this out to you, lest you should think 
<A NAME="494"></A>that I have some animosity against you, and that I speak, not for the sake 
<A NAME="495"></A>of discovering the truth, but from jealousy of you. Now if you are one 
<A NAME="496"></A>of my sort, I should like to cross-examine you, but if not I will let you 
<A NAME="497"></A>alone. And what is my sort? you will ask. I am one of those who are very 
<A NAME="498"></A>willing to be refuted if I say anything which is not true, and very willing 
<A NAME="499"></A>to refute any one else who says what is not true, and quite as ready to 
<A NAME="500"></A>be refuted as to refute-I for I hold that this is the greater gain of the 
<A NAME="501"></A>two, just as the gain is greater of being cured of a very great evil than 
<A NAME="502"></A>of curing another. For I imagine that there is no evil which a man can 
<A NAME="503"></A>endure so great as an erroneous opinion about the matters of which we are 
<A NAME="504"></A>speaking and if you claim to be one of my sort, let us have the discussion 
<A NAME="505"></A>out, but if you would rather have done, no matter-let us make an end of 
<A NAME="506"></A>it.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> I should say, Socrates, that I am quite the man whom 
<A NAME="508"></A>you indicate; but, perhaps, we ought to consider the audience, for, before 
<A NAME="509"></A>you came, I had already given a long exhibition, and if we proceed the 
<A NAME="510"></A>argument may run on to a great length. And therefore I think that we should 
<A NAME="511"></A>consider whether we, may not be detaining some part of the company when 
<A NAME="512"></A>they are wanting to do something else.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR><B>Chaer.</B> You hear the audience cheering, Gorgias and Socrates, 
<A NAME="514"></A>which shows their desire to listen to you; and for myself, Heaven forbid 
<A NAME="515"></A>that I should have any business on hand which would take me Away from a 
<A NAME="516"></A>discussion so interesting and so ably maintained.
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR><B>Cal.</B> By the gods, Chaerephon, although I have been present 
<A NAME="518"></A>at many discussions, I doubt whether I was ever so much delighted before, 
<A NAME="519"></A>and therefore if you go on discoursing all day I shall be the better 
<A NAME="520"></A>pleased.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I may truly say, Callicles, that I am willing, if Gorgias 
<A NAME="522"></A>is.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> After all this, Socrates, I should be disgraced if 
<A NAME="524"></A>I refused, especially as I have promised to answer all comers; in accordance 
<A NAME="525"></A>with the wishes of the company, them, do you begin. and ask of me any question 
<A NAME="526"></A>which you like.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let me tell you then, Gorgias, what surprises me in 
<A NAME="528"></A>your words; though I dare say that you may be right, and I may have understood 
<A NAME="529"></A>your meaning. You say that you can make any man, who will learn of you, 
<A NAME="530"></A>a rhetorician?
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do you mean that you will teach him to gain the ears 
<A NAME="533"></A>of the multitude on any subject, and this not by instruction but by 
<A NAME="534"></A>persuasion?
<A NAME="535"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Quite so.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You were saying, in fact, that the rhetorician will 
<A NAME="537"></A>have, greater powers of persuasion than the physician even in a matter 
<A NAME="538"></A>of health?
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes, with the multitude-that is.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You mean to say, with the ignorant; for with those 
<A NAME="541"></A>who know he cannot be supposed to have greater powers of 
<A NAME="542"></A>persuasion.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But if he is to have more power of persuasion than 
<A NAME="545"></A>the physician, he will have greater power than he who 
<A NAME="546"></A>knows?
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Although he is not a physician:-is 
<A NAME="549"></A>he?
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> No.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And he who is not a physician must, obviously, be ignorant 
<A NAME="552"></A>of what the physician knows.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Clearly.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, when the rhetorician is more persuasive than 
<A NAME="555"></A>the physician, the ignorant is more persuasive with the ignorant than he 
<A NAME="556"></A>who has knowledge?-is not that the inference?
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> In the case supposed:-Yes.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the same holds of the relation of rhetoric to all 
<A NAME="559"></A>the other arts; the rhetorician need not know the truth about things; he 
<A NAME="560"></A>has only to discover some way of persuading the ignorant that he has more 
<A NAME="561"></A>knowledge than those who know?
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes, Socrates, and is not this a great comfort?-not 
<A NAME="563"></A>to have learned the other arts, but the art of rhetoric only, and yet to 
<A NAME="564"></A>be in no way inferior to the professors of them?
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Whether the rhetorician is or not inferior on this 
<A NAME="566"></A>account is a question which we will hereafter examine if the enquiry is 
<A NAME="567"></A>likely to be of any service to us; but I would rather begin by asking, 
<A NAME="568"></A>whether he is as ignorant of the just and unjust, base and honourable, 
<A NAME="569"></A>good and evil, as he is of medicine and the other arts; I mean to say, 
<A NAME="570"></A>does he really know anything of what is good and evil, base or honourable, 
<A NAME="571"></A>just or unjust in them; or has he only a way with the ignorant of persuading 
<A NAME="572"></A>them that he not knowing is to be esteemed to know more about these things 
<A NAME="573"></A>than some. one else who knows? Or must the pupil know these things and 
<A NAME="574"></A>come to you knowing them before he can acquire the art of rhetoric? If 
<A NAME="575"></A>he is ignorant, you who are the teacher of rhetoric will not teach him-it 
<A NAME="576"></A>is not your business; but you will make him seem to the multitude to know 
<A NAME="577"></A>them, when he does not know them; and seem to be a good man, when he is 
<A NAME="578"></A>not. Or will you be unable to teach him rhetoric at all, unless he knows 
<A NAME="579"></A>the truth of these things first? What is to be said about all this? By 
<A NAME="580"></A>heavens, Gorgias, I wish that you would reveal to me the power of rhetoric, 
<A NAME="581"></A>as you were saying that you would.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Well, Socrates, I suppose that if the pupil does chance 
<A NAME="583"></A>not to know them, he will have to learn of me these things as 
<A NAME="584"></A>well.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Say no more, for there you are right; and so he whom 
<A NAME="586"></A>you make a rhetorician must either know the nature of the just and unjust 
<A NAME="587"></A>already, or he must be taught by you.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, and is not he who has learned carpentering a 
<A NAME="590"></A>carpenter?
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And he who has learned music a musician?
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And he who has learned medicine is a physician, in 
<A NAME="595"></A>like manner? He who has learned anything whatever is that which his knowledge 
<A NAME="596"></A>makes him.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And in the same way, he who has learned what is just 
<A NAME="599"></A>is just?
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And he who is just may be supposed to do what is 
<A NAME="602"></A>just?
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And must not the just man always desire to do what 
<A NAME="605"></A>is just?
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> That is clearly the inference.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Surely, then, the just man will never consent to do 
<A NAME="608"></A>injustice?
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And according to the argument the rhetorician must 
<A NAME="611"></A>be a just man?
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And will therefore never be willing to do 
<A NAME="614"></A>injustice?
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Clearly not.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But do you remember saying just now that the trainer 
<A NAME="617"></A>is not to be accused or banished if the pugilist makes a wrong use of his 
<A NAME="618"></A>pugilistic art; and in like manner, if the rhetorician makes a bad and 
<A NAME="619"></A>unjust use of rhetoric, that is not to be laid to the charge of his teacher, 
<A NAME="620"></A>who is not to be banished, but the wrong-doer himself who made a bad use 
<A NAME="621"></A>of his rhetoric-he is to be banished-was not that said?
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes, it was.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But now we are affirming that the aforesaid rhetorician 
<A NAME="624"></A>will never have done injustice at all?
<A NAME="625"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> True.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And at the very outset, Gorgias, it was said that rhetoric 
<A NAME="627"></A>treated of discourse, not [like arithmetic] about odd and even, but about 
<A NAME="628"></A>just and unjust? Was not this said?
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I was thinking at the time, when I heard you saying 
<A NAME="631"></A>so, that rhetoric, which is always discoursing about justice, could not 
<A NAME="632"></A>possibly be an unjust thing. But when you added, shortly afterwards, that 
<A NAME="633"></A>the rhetorician might make a bad use of rhetoric I noted with surprise 
<A NAME="634"></A>the inconsistency into which you had fallen; and I said, that if you thought, 
<A NAME="635"></A>as I did, that there was a gain in being refuted, there would be an advantage 
<A NAME="636"></A>in going on with the question, but if not, I would leave off. And in the 
<A NAME="637"></A>course of our investigations, as you will see yourself, the rhetorician 
<A NAME="638"></A>has been acknowledged to be incapable of making an unjust use of rhetoric, 
<A NAME="639"></A>or of willingness to do injustice. By the dog, Gorgias, there will be a 
<A NAME="640"></A>great deal of discussion, before we get at the truth of all 
<A NAME="641"></A>this.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR><BR><B>Polus.</B> And do even you, Socrates, seriously believe what 
<A NAME="643"></A>you are now saying about rhetoric? What! because Gorgias was ashamed to 
<A NAME="644"></A>deny that the rhetorician knew the just and the honourable and the good, 
<A NAME="645"></A>and admitted that to any one who came to him ignorant of them he could 
<A NAME="646"></A>teach them, and then out of this admission there arose a contradiction-the 
<A NAME="647"></A>thing which you dearly love, and to which not he, but you, brought the 
<A NAME="648"></A>argument by your captious questions-[do you seriously believe that there 
<A NAME="649"></A>is any truth in all this?] For will any one ever acknowledge that he does 
<A NAME="650"></A>not know, or cannot teach, the nature of justice? The truth is, that there 
<A NAME="651"></A>is great want of manners in bringing the argument to such a 
<A NAME="652"></A>pass.
<A NAME="653"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Illustrious Polus, the reason why we provide ourselves 
<A NAME="654"></A>with friends and children is, that when we get old and stumble, a younger 
<A NAME="655"></A>generation may be at hand to set us on our legs again in our words and 
<A NAME="656"></A>in our actions: and now, if I and Gorgias are stumbling, here are you who 
<A NAME="657"></A>should raise us up; and I for my part engage to retract any error into 
<A NAME="658"></A>which you may think that I have fallen-upon one condition:
<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> What condition?
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That you contract, Polus, the prolixity of speech in 
<A NAME="661"></A>which you indulged at first.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> What! do you mean that I may not use as many words 
<A NAME="663"></A>as I please?
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Only to think, my friend, that having come on a visit 
<A NAME="665"></A>to Athens, which is the most free-spoken state in Hellas, you when you 
<A NAME="666"></A>got there, and you alone, should be deprived of the power of speech-that 
<A NAME="667"></A>would be hard indeed. But then consider my case:-shall not I be very hardly 
<A NAME="668"></A>used, if, when you are making a long oration, and refusing to answer what 
<A NAME="669"></A>you are asked, I am compelled to stay and listen to you, and may not go 
<A NAME="670"></A>away? I say rather, if you have a real interest in the argument, or, to 
<A NAME="671"></A>repeat my former expression, have any desire to set it on its legs, take 
<A NAME="672"></A>back any statement which you please; and in your turn ask and answer, like 
<A NAME="673"></A>myself and Gorgias-refute and be refuted: for I suppose that you would 
<A NAME="674"></A>claim to know what Gorgias knows-would you not?
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And you, like him, invite any one to ask you about 
<A NAME="677"></A>anything which he pleases, and you will know how to answer 
<A NAME="678"></A>him?
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="680"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And now, which will you do, ask or 
<A NAME="681"></A>answer?
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> I will ask; and do you answer me, Socrates, the same 
<A NAME="683"></A>question which Gorgias, as you suppose, is unable to answer: What is 
<A NAME="684"></A>rhetoric?
<A NAME="685"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do you mean what sort of an art?
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> To say the truth, Polus, it is not an art at all, in 
<A NAME="688"></A>my opinion.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Then what, in your opinion, is rhetoric?
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> A thing which, as I was lately reading in a book of 
<A NAME="691"></A>yours, you say that you have made an art.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> What thing?
<A NAME="693"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I should say a sort of experience.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Does rhetoric seem to you to be an 
<A NAME="695"></A>experience?
<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That is my view, but you may be of another 
<A NAME="697"></A>mind.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> An experience in what?
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> An experience in producing a sort of delight and 
<A NAME="700"></A>gratification.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> And if able to gratify others, must not rhetoric be 
<A NAME="702"></A>a fine thing?
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What are you saying, Polus? Why do you ask me whether 
<A NAME="704"></A>rhetoric is a fine thing or not, when I have not as yet told you what rhetoric 
<A NAME="705"></A>is?
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Did I not hear you say that rhetoric was a sort of 
<A NAME="707"></A>experience?
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Will you, who are so desirous to gratify others, afford 
<A NAME="709"></A>a slight gratification to me?
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> I will.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Will you ask me, what sort of an art is 
<A NAME="712"></A>cookery?
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> What sort of an art is cookery?
<A NAME="714"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Not an art at all, Polus.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> What then?
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I should say an experience.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> In what? I wish that you would explain to 
<A NAME="718"></A>me.
<A NAME="719"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> An experience in producing a sort of delight and gratification, 
<A NAME="720"></A>Polus.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Then are cookery and rhetoric the 
<A NAME="722"></A>same?
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> No, they are only different parts of the same 
<A NAME="724"></A>profession.
<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Of what profession?
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I am afraid that the truth may seem discourteous; and 
<A NAME="727"></A>I hesitate to answer, lest Gorgias should imagine that I am making fun 
<A NAME="728"></A>of his own profession. For whether or no this is that art of rhetoric which 
<A NAME="729"></A>Gorgias practises I really cannot tell:-from what he was just now saying, 
<A NAME="730"></A>nothing appeared of what he thought of his art, but the rhetoric which 
<A NAME="731"></A>I mean is a part of a not very creditable whole.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> A part of what, Socrates? Say what you mean, and never 
<A NAME="733"></A>mind me.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> In my opinion then, Gorgias, the whole of which rhetoric 
<A NAME="735"></A>is a part is not an art at all, but the habit of a bold and ready wit, 
<A NAME="736"></A>which knows how to manage mankind: this habit I sum up under the word "flattery"; 
<A NAME="737"></A>and it appears to me to have many other parts, one of which is cookery, 
<A NAME="738"></A>which may seem to be an art, but, as I maintain, is only an experience 
<A NAME="739"></A>or routine and not an art:-another part is rhetoric, and the art of attiring 
<A NAME="740"></A>and sophistry are two others: thus there are four branches, and four different 
<A NAME="741"></A>things answering to them. And Polus may ask, if he likes, for he has not 
<A NAME="742"></A>as yet been informed, what part of flattery is rhetoric: he did not see 
<A NAME="743"></A>that I had not yet answered him when he proceeded to ask a further question: 
<A NAME="744"></A>Whether I do not think rhetoric a fine thing? But I shall not tell him 
<A NAME="745"></A>whether rhetoric is a fine thing or not, until I have first answered, "What 
<A NAME="746"></A>is rhetoric?" For that would not be right, Polus; but I shall be happy 
<A NAME="747"></A>to answer, if you will ask me, What part of flattery is 
<A NAME="748"></A>rhetoric?
<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> I will ask and do you answer? What part of flattery 
<A NAME="750"></A>is rhetoric?
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Will you understand my answer? Rhetoric, according 
<A NAME="752"></A>to my view, is the ghost or counterfeit of a part of 
<A NAME="753"></A>politics.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> And noble or ignoble?
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Ignoble, I should say, if I am compelled to answer, 
<A NAME="756"></A>for I call what is bad ignoble: though I doubt whether you understand what 
<A NAME="757"></A>I was saying before.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Indeed, Socrates, I cannot say that I understand 
<A NAME="759"></A>myself.
<A NAME="760"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I do not wonder, Gorgias; for I have not as yet explained 
<A NAME="761"></A>myself, and our friend Polus, colt by name and colt by nature, is apt to 
<A NAME="762"></A>run away.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Never mind him, but explain to me what you mean by 
<A NAME="764"></A>saying that rhetoric is the counterfeit of a part of 
<A NAME="765"></A>politics.
<A NAME="766"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I will try, then, to explain my notion of rhetoric, 
<A NAME="767"></A>and if I am mistaken, my friend Polus shall refute me. We may assume the 
<A NAME="768"></A>existence of bodies and of souls?
<A NAME="769"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="770"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You would further admit that there is a good condition 
<A NAME="771"></A>of either of them?
<A NAME="772"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Which condition may not be really good, but good only 
<A NAME="774"></A>in appearance? I mean to say, that there are many persons who appear to 
<A NAME="775"></A>be in good health, and whom only a physician or trainer will discern at 
<A NAME="776"></A>first sight not to be in good health.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> True.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And this applies not only to the body, but also to 
<A NAME="779"></A>the soul: in either there may be that which gives the appearance of health 
<A NAME="780"></A>and not the reality?
<A NAME="781"></A><BR><BR><B>Gor.</B> Yes, certainly.
<A NAME="782"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And now I will endeavour to explain to you more clearly 
<A NAME="783"></A>what I mean: The soul and body being two, have two arts corresponding to 
<A NAME="784"></A>them: there is the art of politics attending on the soul; and another art 
<A NAME="785"></A>attending on the body, of which I know no single name, but which may be 
<A NAME="786"></A>described as having two divisions, one of them gymnastic, and the other 
<A NAME="787"></A>medicine. And in politics there is a legislative part, which answers to 
<A NAME="788"></A>gymnastic, as justice does to medicine; and the two parts run into one 
<A NAME="789"></A>another, justice having to do with the same subject as legislation, and 
<A NAME="790"></A>medicine with the same subject as gymnastic, but with a difference. Now, 
<A NAME="791"></A>seeing that there are these four arts, two attending on the body and two 
<A NAME="792"></A>on the soul for their highest good; flattery knowing, or rather guessing 
<A NAME="793"></A>their natures, has distributed herself into four shams or simulations of 
<A NAME="794"></A>them; she puts on the likeness of some one or other of them, and pretends 
<A NAME="795"></A>to be that which she simulates, and having no regard for men's highest 
<A NAME="796"></A>interests, is ever making pleasure the bait of the unwary, and deceiving 
<A NAME="797"></A>them into the belief that she is of the highest value to them. Cookery 
<A NAME="798"></A>simulates the disguise of medicine, and pretends to know what food is the 
<A NAME="799"></A>best for the body; and if the physician and the cook had to enter into 
<A NAME="800"></A>a competition in which children were the judges, or men who had no more 
<A NAME="801"></A>sense than children, as to which of them best understands the goodness 
<A NAME="802"></A>or badness of food, the physician would be starved to death. A flattery 
<A NAME="803"></A>I deem this to be and of an ignoble sort, Polus, for to you I am now addressing 
<A NAME="804"></A>myself, because it aims at pleasure without any thought of the best. An 
<A NAME="805"></A>art I do not call it, but only an experience, because it is unable to explain 
<A NAME="806"></A>or to give a reason of the nature of its own applications. And I do not 
<A NAME="807"></A>call any irrational thing an art; but if you dispute my words, I am prepared 
<A NAME="808"></A>to argue in defence of them.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR>Cookery, then, I maintain to be a flattery which takes the form 
<A NAME="810"></A>of medicine; and tiring, in like manner, is a flattery which takes the 
<A NAME="811"></A>form of gymnastic, and is knavish, false, ignoble, illiberal, working deceitfully 
<A NAME="812"></A>by the help of lines, and colours, and enamels, and garments, and making 
<A NAME="813"></A>men affect a spurious beauty to the neglect of the true beauty which is 
<A NAME="814"></A>given by gymnastic.
<A NAME="815"></A><BR><BR>I would rather not be tedious, and therefore I will only say, after 
<A NAME="816"></A>the manner of the geometricians (for I think that by this time you will 
<A NAME="817"></A>be able to follow)
<A NAME="818"></A><BR><BR>astiring : gymnastic :: cookery : medicine; or 
<A NAME="819"></A>rather,
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR>astiring : gymnastic :: sophistry : legislation; 
<A NAME="821"></A>and
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR>as cookery : medicine :: rhetoric : justice. And this, I say, is 
<A NAME="823"></A>the natural difference between the rhetorician and the sophist, but by 
<A NAME="824"></A>reason of their near connection, they are apt to be jumbled up together; 
<A NAME="825"></A>neither do they know what to make of themselves, nor do other men know 
<A NAME="826"></A>what to make of them. For if the body presided over itself, and were not 
<A NAME="827"></A>under the guidance of the soul, and the soul did not discern and discriminate 
<A NAME="828"></A>between cookery and medicine, but the body was made the judge of them, 
<A NAME="829"></A>and the rule of judgment was the bodily delight which was given by them, 
<A NAME="830"></A>then the word of Anaxagoras, that word with which you, friend Polus, are 
<A NAME="831"></A>so well acquainted, would prevail far and wide: "Chaos" would come again, 
<A NAME="832"></A>and cookery, health, and medicine would mingle in an indiscriminate mass. 
<A NAME="833"></A>And now I have told you my notion of rhetoric, which is, in relation to 
<A NAME="834"></A>the soul, what cookery is to the body. I may have been inconsistent in 
<A NAME="835"></A>making a long speech, when I would not allow you to discourse at length. 
<A NAME="836"></A>But I think that I may be excused, because you did not understand me, and 
<A NAME="837"></A>could make no use of my answer when I spoke shortly, and therefore I had 
<A NAME="838"></A>to enter into explanation. And if I show an equal inability to make use 
<A NAME="839"></A>of yours, I hope that you will speak at equal length; but if I am able 
<A NAME="840"></A>to understand you, let me have the benefit of your brevity, as is only 
<A NAME="841"></A>fair: And now you may do what you please with my answer.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> What do you mean? do you think that rhetoric is 
<A NAME="843"></A>flattery?
<A NAME="844"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Nay, I said a part of flattery-if at your age, Polus, 
<A NAME="845"></A>you cannot remember, what will you do by-and-by, when you get 
<A NAME="846"></A>older?
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> And are the good rhetoricians meanly regarded in states, 
<A NAME="848"></A>under the idea that they are flatterers?
<A NAME="849"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Is that a question or the beginning of a 
<A NAME="850"></A>speech?
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> I am asking a question.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then my answer is, that they are not regarded at 
<A NAME="853"></A>all.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> How not regarded? Have they not very great power in 
<A NAME="855"></A>states?
<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Not if you mean to say that power is a good to the 
<A NAME="857"></A>possessor.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> And that is what I do mean to say.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, if so, I think that they have the least power 
<A NAME="860"></A>of all the citizens.
<A NAME="861"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> What! Are they not like tyrants? They kill and despoil 
<A NAME="862"></A>and exile any one whom they please.
<A NAME="863"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> By the dog, Polus, I cannot make out at each deliverance 
<A NAME="864"></A>of yours, whether you are giving an opinion of your own, or asking a question 
<A NAME="865"></A>of me.
<A NAME="866"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> I am asking a question of you.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, my friend, but you ask two questions at 
<A NAME="868"></A>once.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> How two questions?
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why, did you not say just now that the rhetoricians 
<A NAME="871"></A>are like tyrants, and that they kill and despoil or exile any one whom 
<A NAME="872"></A>they please?
<A NAME="873"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> I did.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well then, I say to you that here are two questions 
<A NAME="875"></A>in one, and I will answer both of them. And I tell you, Polus, that rhetoricians 
<A NAME="876"></A>and tyrants have the least possible power in states, as I was just now 
<A NAME="877"></A>saying; for they do literally nothing which they will, but only what they 
<A NAME="878"></A>think best.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> And is not that a great power?
<A NAME="880"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Polus has already said the reverse.
<A NAME="881"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> No, by the great-what do you call him?-not you, for 
<A NAME="882"></A>you say that power is a good to him who has the power.
<A NAME="883"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> I do.
<A NAME="884"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And would you maintain that if a fool does what he 
<A NAME="885"></A>think best, this is a good, and would you call this great 
<A NAME="886"></A>power?
<A NAME="887"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> I should not.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then you must prove that the rhetorician is not a fool, 
<A NAME="889"></A>and that rhetoric is an art and not a flattery-and so you will have refuted 
<A NAME="890"></A>me; but if you leave me unrefuted, why, the rhetoricians who do what they 
<A NAME="891"></A>think best in states, and the tyrants, will have nothing upon which to 
<A NAME="892"></A>congratulate themselves, if as you say, power be indeed a good, admitting 
<A NAME="893"></A>at the same time that what is done without sense is an 
<A NAME="894"></A>evil.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Yes; I admit that.
<A NAME="896"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> How then can the rhetoricians or the tyrants have great 
<A NAME="897"></A>power in states, unless Polus can refute Socrates, and prove to him that 
<A NAME="898"></A>they do as they will?
<A NAME="899"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> This fellow-
<A NAME="900"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I say that they do not do as they will-now refute 
<A NAME="901"></A>me.
<A NAME="902"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Why, have you not already said that they do as they 
<A NAME="903"></A>think best?
<A NAME="904"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And I say so still.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Then surely they do as they will?
<A NAME="906"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I deny it.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> But they do what they think best?
<A NAME="908"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Aye.
<A NAME="909"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> That, Socrates, is monstrous and 
<A NAME="910"></A>absurd.
<A NAME="911"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Good words, good Polus, as I may say in your own peculiar 
<A NAME="912"></A>style; but if you have any questions to ask of me, either prove that I 
<A NAME="913"></A>am in error or give the answer yourself.
<A NAME="914"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Very well, I am willing to answer that I may know what 
<A NAME="915"></A>you mean.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do men appear to you to will that which they do, or 
<A NAME="917"></A>to will that further end for the sake of which they do a thing? when they 
<A NAME="918"></A>take medicine, for example, at the bidding of a physician, do they will 
<A NAME="919"></A>the drinking of the medicine which is painful, or the health for the sake 
<A NAME="920"></A>of which they drink?
<A NAME="921"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Clearly, the health.
<A NAME="922"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And when men go on a voyage or engage in business, 
<A NAME="923"></A>they do not will that which they are doing at the time; for who would desire 
<A NAME="924"></A>to take the risk of a voyage or the trouble of business?-But they will, 
<A NAME="925"></A>to have the wealth for the sake of which they go on a 
<A NAME="926"></A>voyage.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is not this universally true? If a man does something 
<A NAME="929"></A>for the sake of something else, he wills not that which he does, but that 
<A NAME="930"></A>for the sake of which he does it.
<A NAME="931"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And are not all things either good or evil, or intermediate 
<A NAME="933"></A>and indifferent?
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> To be sure, Socrates.
<A NAME="935"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Wisdom and health and wealth and the like you would 
<A NAME="936"></A>call goods, and their opposites evils?
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> I should.
<A NAME="938"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the things which are neither good nor evil, and 
<A NAME="939"></A>which partake sometimes of the nature of good and at other times of evil, 
<A NAME="940"></A>or of neither, are such as sitting, walking, running, sailing; or, again, 
<A NAME="941"></A>wood, stones, and the like:-these are the things which you call neither 
<A NAME="942"></A>good nor evil?
<A NAME="943"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Exactly so.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Are these indifferent things done for the sake of the 
<A NAME="945"></A>good, or the good for the sake of the indifferent?
<A NAME="946"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Clearly, the indifferent for the sake of the 
<A NAME="947"></A>good.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> When we walk we walk for the sake of the good, and 
<A NAME="949"></A>under the idea that it is better to walk, and when we stand we stand equally 
<A NAME="950"></A>for the sake of the good?
<A NAME="951"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="952"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And when we kill a man we kill him or exile him or 
<A NAME="953"></A>despoil him of his goods, because, as we think, it will conduce to our 
<A NAME="954"></A>good?
<A NAME="955"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Men who do any of these things do them for the sake 
<A NAME="957"></A>of the good?
<A NAME="958"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="959"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And did we not admit that in doing something for the 
<A NAME="960"></A>sake of something else, we do not will those things which we do, but that 
<A NAME="961"></A>other thing for the sake of which we do them?
<A NAME="962"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then we do not will simply to kill a man or to exile 
<A NAME="964"></A>him or to despoil him of his goods, but we will to do that which conduces 
<A NAME="965"></A>to our good, and if the act is not conducive to our good we do not will 
<A NAME="966"></A>it; for we will, as you say, that which is our good, but that which is 
<A NAME="967"></A>neither good nor evil, or simply evil, we do not will. Why are you silent, 
<A NAME="968"></A>Polus? Am I not right?
<A NAME="969"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> You are right.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Hence we may infer, that if any one, whether he be 
<A NAME="971"></A>a tyrant or a rhetorician, kills another or exiles another or deprives 
<A NAME="972"></A>him of his property, under the idea that the act is for his own interests 
<A NAME="973"></A>when really not for his own interests, he may be said to do what seems 
<A NAME="974"></A>best to him?
<A NAME="975"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="976"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But does he do what he wills if he does what is evil? 
<A NAME="977"></A>Why do you not answer?
<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Well, I suppose not.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then if great power is a good as you allow, will such 
<A NAME="980"></A>a one have great power in a state?
<A NAME="981"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> He will not.
<A NAME="982"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then I was right in saying that a man may do what seems 
<A NAME="983"></A>good to him in a state, and not have great power, and not do what he 
<A NAME="984"></A>wills?
<A NAME="985"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> As though you, Socrates, would not like to have the 
<A NAME="986"></A>power of doing what seemed good to you in the state, rather than not; you 
<A NAME="987"></A>would not be jealous when you saw any one killing or despoiling or imprisoning 
<A NAME="988"></A>whom he pleased, Oh, no!
<A NAME="989"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Justly or unjustly, do you mean?
<A NAME="990"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> In either case is he not equally to be 
<A NAME="991"></A>envied?
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Forbear, Polus!
<A NAME="993"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Why "forbear"?
<A NAME="994"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Because you ought not to envy wretches who are not 
<A NAME="995"></A>to be envied, but only to pity them.
<A NAME="996"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> And are those of whom spoke wretches?
<A NAME="997"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, certainly they are.
<A NAME="998"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> And so you think that he who slays any one whom he 
<A NAME="999"></A>pleases, and justly slays him, is pitiable and wretched?
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> No, I do not say that of him: but neither do I think 
<A NAME="1001"></A>that he is to be envied.
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Were you not saying just now that he is 
<A NAME="1003"></A>wretched?
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, my friend, if he killed another unjustly, in which 
<A NAME="1005"></A>case he is also to be pitied; and he is not to be envied if he killed him 
<A NAME="1006"></A>justly.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> At any rate you will allow that he who is unjustly 
<A NAME="1008"></A>put to death is wretched, and to be pitied?
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Not so much, Polus, as he who kills him, and not so 
<A NAME="1010"></A>much as he who is justly killed.
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> How can that be, Socrates?
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That may very well be, inasmuch as doing injustice 
<A NAME="1013"></A>is the greatest of evils.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> But is it the greatest? Is not suffering injustice 
<A NAME="1015"></A>a greater evil?
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Then would you rather suffer than do 
<A NAME="1018"></A>injustice?
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I should not like either, but if I must choose between 
<A NAME="1020"></A>them, I would rather suffer than do.
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Then you would not wish to be a 
<A NAME="1022"></A>tyrant?
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Not if you mean by tyranny what I 
<A NAME="1024"></A>mean.
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> I mean, as I said before, the power of doing whatever 
<A NAME="1026"></A>seems good to you in a state, killing, banishing, doing in all things as 
<A NAME="1027"></A>you like.
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well then, illustrious friend, when I have said my 
<A NAME="1029"></A>say, do you reply to me. Suppose that I go into a crowded Agora, and take 
<A NAME="1030"></A>a dagger under my arm. Polus, I say to you, I have just acquired rare power, 
<A NAME="1031"></A>and become a tyrant; for if I think that any of these men whom you see 
<A NAME="1032"></A>ought to be put to death, the man whom I have a mind to kill is as good 
<A NAME="1033"></A>as dead; and if I am disposed to break his head or tear his garment, he 
<A NAME="1034"></A>will have his head broken or his garment torn in an instant. Such is my 
<A NAME="1035"></A>great power in this city. And if you do not believe me, and I show you 
<A NAME="1036"></A>the dagger, you would probably reply: Socrates, in that sort of way any 
<A NAME="1037"></A>one may have great power-he may burn any house which he pleases, and the 
<A NAME="1038"></A>docks and triremes of the Athenians, and all their other vessels, whether 
<A NAME="1039"></A>public or private-but can you believe that this mere doing as you think 
<A NAME="1040"></A>best is great power?
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Certainly not such doing as this.
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But can you tell me why you disapprove of such a 
<A NAME="1043"></A>power?
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> I can.
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why then?
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Why, because he who did as you say would be certain 
<A NAME="1047"></A>to be punished.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And punishment is an evil?
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And you would admit once more, my good sir, that great 
<A NAME="1051"></A>power is a benefit to a man if his actions turn out to his advantage, and 
<A NAME="1052"></A>that this is the meaning of great power; and if not, then his power is 
<A NAME="1053"></A>an evil and is no power. But let us look at the matter in another way do 
<A NAME="1054"></A>we not acknowledge that the things of which we were speaking, the infliction 
<A NAME="1055"></A>of death, and exile, and the deprivation of property are sometimes a good 
<A NAME="1056"></A>and sometimes not a good?
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> About that you and I may be supposed to 
<A NAME="1059"></A>agree?
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Tell me, then, when do you say that they are good and 
<A NAME="1062"></A>when that they are evil-what principle do you lay down?
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> I would rather, Socrates, that you should answer as 
<A NAME="1064"></A>well as ask that question.
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, Polus, since you would rather have the answer 
<A NAME="1066"></A>from me, I say that they are good when they are just, and evil when they 
<A NAME="1067"></A>are unjust.
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> You are hard of refutation, Socrates, but might not 
<A NAME="1069"></A>a child refute that statement?
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then I shall be very grateful to the child, and equally 
<A NAME="1071"></A>grateful to you if you will refute me and deliver me from my foolishness. 
<A NAME="1072"></A>And I hope that refute me you will, and not weary of doing good to a 
<A NAME="1073"></A>friend.
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Yes, Socrates, and I need not go far or appeal to antiquity; 
<A NAME="1075"></A>events which happened only a few days ago are enough to refute you, and 
<A NAME="1076"></A>to prove that many men who do wrong are happy.
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What events?
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> You see, I presume, that Archelaus the son of Perdiccas 
<A NAME="1079"></A>is now the ruler of Macedonia?
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> At any rate I hear that he is.
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> And do you think that he is happy or 
<A NAME="1082"></A>miserable?
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I cannot say, Polus, for I have never had any acquaintance 
<A NAME="1084"></A>with him.
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> And cannot you tell at once, and without having an 
<A NAME="1086"></A>acquaintance with him, whether a man is happy?
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Most certainly not.
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Then clearly, Socrates, you would say that you did 
<A NAME="1089"></A>not even know whether the great king was a happy man?
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And I should speak the truth; for I do not know how 
<A NAME="1091"></A>he stands in the matter of education and justice.
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> What! and does all happiness consist in 
<A NAME="1093"></A>this?
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, indeed, Polus, that is my doctrine; the men and 
<A NAME="1095"></A>women who are gentle and good are also happy, as I maintain, and the unjust 
<A NAME="1096"></A>and evil are miserable.
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Then, according to your doctrine, the said Archelaus 
<A NAME="1098"></A>is miserable?
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, my friend, if he is wicked.
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> That he is wicked I cannot deny; for he had no title 
<A NAME="1101"></A>at all to the throne which he now occupies, he being only the son of a 
<A NAME="1102"></A>woman who was the slave of Alcetas the brother of Perdiccas; he himself 
<A NAME="1103"></A>therefore in strict right was the slave of Alcetas; and if he had meant 
<A NAME="1104"></A>to do rightly he would have remained his slave, and then, according to 
<A NAME="1105"></A>your doctrine, he would have been happy. But now he is unspeakably miserable, 
<A NAME="1106"></A>for he has been guilty of the greatest crimes: in the first place he invited 
<A NAME="1107"></A>his uncle and master, Alcetas, to come to him, under the pretence that 
<A NAME="1108"></A>he would restore to him the throne which Perdiccas has usurped, and after 
<A NAME="1109"></A>entertaining him and his son Alexander, who was his own cousin, and nearly 
<A NAME="1110"></A>of an age with him, and making them drunk, he threw them into a waggon 
<A NAME="1111"></A>and carried them off by night, and slew them, and got both of them out 
<A NAME="1112"></A>of the way; and when he had done all this wickedness he never discovered 
<A NAME="1113"></A>that he was the most miserable of all men, was very far from repenting: 
<A NAME="1114"></A>shall I tell you how he showed his remorse? he had a younger brother, a 
<A NAME="1115"></A>child of seven years old, who was the legitimate son of Perdiccas, and 
<A NAME="1116"></A>to him of right the kingdom belonged; Archelaus, however, had no mind to 
<A NAME="1117"></A>bring him up as he ought and restore the kingdom to him; that was not his 
<A NAME="1118"></A>notion of happiness; but not long afterwards he threw him into a well and 
<A NAME="1119"></A>drowned him, and declared to his mother Cleopatra that he had fallen in 
<A NAME="1120"></A>while running after a goose, and had been killed. And now as he is the 
<A NAME="1121"></A>greatest criminal of all the Macedonians, he may be supposed to be the 
<A NAME="1122"></A>most miserable and not the happiest of them, and I dare say that there 
<A NAME="1123"></A>are many Athenians, and you would be at the head of them, who would rather 
<A NAME="1124"></A>be any other Macedonian than Archelaus!
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I praised you at first, Polus, for being a rhetorician 
<A NAME="1126"></A>rather than a reasoner. And this, as I suppose, is the sort of argument 
<A NAME="1127"></A>with which you fancy that a child might refute me, and by which I stand 
<A NAME="1128"></A>refuted when I say that the unjust man is not happy. But, my good friend, 
<A NAME="1129"></A>where is the refutation? I cannot admit a word which you have been 
<A NAME="1130"></A>saying.
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> That is because you will not; for you surely must think 
<A NAME="1132"></A>as I do.
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Not so, my simple friend, but because you will refute 
<A NAME="1134"></A>me after the manner which rhetoricians practise in courts of law. For there 
<A NAME="1135"></A>the one party think that they refute the other when they bring forward 
<A NAME="1136"></A>a number of witnesses of good repute in proof of their allegations, and 
<A NAME="1137"></A>their adversary has only a single one or none at all. But this kind of 
<A NAME="1138"></A>proof is of no value where truth is the aim; a man may often be sworn down 
<A NAME="1139"></A>by a multitude of false witnesses who have a great air of respectability. 
<A NAME="1140"></A>And in this argument nearly every one, Athenian and stranger alike, would 
<A NAME="1141"></A>be on your side, if you should bring witnesses in disproof of my statement-you 
<A NAME="1142"></A>may, if you will, summon Nicias the son of Niceratus, and let his brothers, 
<A NAME="1143"></A>who gave the row of tripods which stand in the precincts of Dionysus, come 
<A NAME="1144"></A>with him; or you may summon Aristocrates, the son of Scellius, who is the 
<A NAME="1145"></A>giver of that famous offering which is at Delphi; summon, if you will, 
<A NAME="1146"></A>the whole house of Pericles, or any other great Athenian family whom you 
<A NAME="1147"></A>choose-they will all agree with you: I only am left alone and cannot agree, 
<A NAME="1148"></A>for you do not convince me; although you produce many false witnesses against 
<A NAME="1149"></A>me, in the hope of depriving me of my inheritance, which is the truth. 
<A NAME="1150"></A>But I consider that nothing worth speaking of will have been effected by 
<A NAME="1151"></A>me unless I make you the one witness of my words; nor by you, unless you 
<A NAME="1152"></A>make me the one witness of yours; no matter about the rest of the world. 
<A NAME="1153"></A>For there are two ways of refutation, one which is yours and that of the 
<A NAME="1154"></A>world in general; but mine is of another sort-let us compare them, and 
<A NAME="1155"></A>see in what they differ. For, indeed, we are at issue about matters which 
<A NAME="1156"></A>to know is honourable and not to know disgraceful; to know or not to know 
<A NAME="1157"></A>happiness and misery-that is the chief of them. And what knowledge can 
<A NAME="1158"></A>be nobler? or what ignorance more disgraceful than this? And therefore 
<A NAME="1159"></A>I will begin by asking you whether you do not think that a man who is unjust 
<A NAME="1160"></A>and doing injustice can be happy, seeing that you think Archelaus unjust, 
<A NAME="1161"></A>and yet happy? May I assume this to be your opinion?
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But I say that this is an impossibility-here is one 
<A NAME="1164"></A>point about which we are at issue:-very good. And do you mean to say also 
<A NAME="1165"></A>that if he meets with retribution and punishment he will still be 
<A NAME="1166"></A>happy?
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Certainly not; in that case he will be most 
<A NAME="1168"></A>miserable.
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> On the other hand, if the unjust be not punished, then, 
<A NAME="1170"></A>according to you, he will be happy?
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1172"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But in my opinion, Polus, the unjust or doer of unjust 
<A NAME="1173"></A>actions is miserable in any case,-more miserable, however, if he be not 
<A NAME="1174"></A>punished and does not meet with retribution, and less miserable if he be 
<A NAME="1175"></A>punished and meets with retribution at the hands of gods and 
<A NAME="1176"></A>men.
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> You are maintaining a strange doctrine, 
<A NAME="1178"></A>Socrates.
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I shall try to make you agree with me, O my friend, 
<A NAME="1180"></A>for as a friend I regard you. Then these are the points at issue between 
<A NAME="1181"></A>us-are they not? I was saying that to do is worse than to suffer 
<A NAME="1182"></A>injustice?
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Exactly so.
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And you said the opposite?
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I said also that the wicked are miserable, and you 
<A NAME="1187"></A>refuted me?
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> By Zeus, I did.
<A NAME="1189"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> In your own opinion, Polus.
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Yes, and I rather suspect that I was in the 
<A NAME="1191"></A>right.
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You further said that the wrong-doer is happy if he 
<A NAME="1193"></A>be unpunished?
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And I affirm that he is most miserable, and that those 
<A NAME="1196"></A>who are punished are less miserable-are you going to refute this proposition 
<A NAME="1197"></A>also?
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> A proposition which is harder of refutation than the 
<A NAME="1199"></A>other, Socrates.
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Say rather, Polus, impossible; for who can refute the 
<A NAME="1201"></A>truth?
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> What do you mean? If a man is detected in an unjust 
<A NAME="1203"></A>attempt to make himself a tyrant, and when detected is racked, mutilated, 
<A NAME="1204"></A>has his eyes burned out, and after having had all sorts of great injuries 
<A NAME="1205"></A>inflicted on him, and having seen his wife and children suffer the like, 
<A NAME="1206"></A>is at last impaled or tarred and burned alive, will he be happier than 
<A NAME="1207"></A>if he escape and become a tyrant, and continue all through life doing what 
<A NAME="1208"></A>he likes and holding the reins of government, the envy and admiration both 
<A NAME="1209"></A>of citizens and strangers? Is that the paradox which, as you say, cannot 
<A NAME="1210"></A>be refuted?
<A NAME="1211"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> There again, noble Polus, you are raising hobgoblins 
<A NAME="1212"></A>instead of refuting me; just now you were calling witnesses against me. 
<A NAME="1213"></A>But please to refresh my memory a little; did you say-"in an unjust attempt 
<A NAME="1214"></A>to make himself a tyrant"?
<A NAME="1215"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Yes, I did.
<A NAME="1216"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then I say that neither of them will be happier than 
<A NAME="1217"></A>the other-neither he who unjustly acquires a tyranny, nor he who suffers 
<A NAME="1218"></A>in the attempt, for of two miserables one cannot be the happier, but that 
<A NAME="1219"></A>he who escapes and becomes a tyrant is the more miserable of the two. Do 
<A NAME="1220"></A>you laugh, Polus? Well, this is a new kind of refutation-when any one says 
<A NAME="1221"></A>anything, instead of refuting him to laugh at him.
<A NAME="1222"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> But do you not think, Socrates, that you have been 
<A NAME="1223"></A>sufficiently refuted, when you say that which no human being will allow? 
<A NAME="1224"></A>Ask the company.
<A NAME="1225"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> O Polus, I am not a public man, and only last year, 
<A NAME="1226"></A>when my tribe were serving as Prytanes, and it became my duty as their 
<A NAME="1227"></A>president to take the votes, there was a laugh at me, because I was unable 
<A NAME="1228"></A>to take them. And as I failed then, you must not ask me to count the suffrages 
<A NAME="1229"></A>of the company now; but if, as I was saying, you have no better argument 
<A NAME="1230"></A>than numbers, let me have a turn, and do you make trial of the sort of 
<A NAME="1231"></A>proof which, as I think, is required; for I shall produce one witness only 
<A NAME="1232"></A>of the truth of my words, and he is the person with whom I am arguing; 
<A NAME="1233"></A>his suffrage I know how to take; but with the many I have nothing to do, 
<A NAME="1234"></A>and do not even address myself to them. May I ask then whether you will 
<A NAME="1235"></A>answer in turn and have your words put to the proof? For I certainly think 
<A NAME="1236"></A>that I and you and every man do really believe, that to do is a greater 
<A NAME="1237"></A>evil than to suffer injustice: and not to be punished than to be 
<A NAME="1238"></A>punished.
<A NAME="1239"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> And I should say neither I, nor any man: would you 
<A NAME="1240"></A>yourself, for example, suffer rather than do injustice?
<A NAME="1241"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, and you, too; I or any man 
<A NAME="1242"></A>would.
<A NAME="1243"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Quite the reverse; neither you, nor I, nor any 
<A NAME="1244"></A>man.
<A NAME="1245"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But will you answer?
<A NAME="1246"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> To be sure, I will-for I am curious to hear what you 
<A NAME="1247"></A>can have to say.
<A NAME="1248"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Tell me, then, and you will know, and let us suppose 
<A NAME="1249"></A>that I am beginning at the beginning: which of the two, Polus, in your 
<A NAME="1250"></A>opinion, is the worst?-to do injustice or to suffer?
<A NAME="1251"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> I should say that suffering was 
<A NAME="1252"></A>worst.
<A NAME="1253"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And which is the greater disgrace?-Answer.
<A NAME="1254"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> To do.
<A NAME="1255"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the greater disgrace is the greater 
<A NAME="1256"></A>evil?
<A NAME="1257"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="1258"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I understand you to say, if I am not mistaken, that 
<A NAME="1259"></A>the honourable is not the same as the good, or the disgraceful as the 
<A NAME="1260"></A>evil?
<A NAME="1261"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="1262"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let me ask a question of you: When you speak of beautiful 
<A NAME="1263"></A>things, such as bodies, colours, figures, sounds, institutions, do you 
<A NAME="1264"></A>not call them beautiful in reference to some standard: bodies, for example, 
<A NAME="1265"></A>are beautiful in proportion as they are useful, or as the sight of them 
<A NAME="1266"></A>gives pleasure to the spectators; can you give any other account of personal 
<A NAME="1267"></A>beauty?
<A NAME="1268"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> I cannot.
<A NAME="1269"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And you would say of figures or colours generally that 
<A NAME="1270"></A>they were beautiful, either by reason of the pleasure which they give, 
<A NAME="1271"></A>or of their use, or both?
<A NAME="1272"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Yes, I should.
<A NAME="1273"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And you would call sounds and music beautiful for the 
<A NAME="1274"></A>same reason?
<A NAME="1275"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> I should.
<A NAME="1276"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Laws and institutions also have no beauty in them except 
<A NAME="1277"></A>in so far as they are useful or pleasant or both?
<A NAME="1278"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> I think not.
<A NAME="1279"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And may not the same be said of the beauty of 
<A NAME="1280"></A>knowledge?
<A NAME="1281"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> To be sure, Socrates; and I very much approve of your 
<A NAME="1282"></A>measuring beauty by the standard of pleasure and utility.
<A NAME="1283"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And deformity or disgrace may be equally measured by 
<A NAME="1284"></A>the opposite standard of pain and evil?
<A NAME="1285"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1286"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then when of two beautiful things one exceeds in beauty, 
<A NAME="1287"></A>the measure of the excess is to be taken in one or both of these; that 
<A NAME="1288"></A>is to say, in pleasure or utility or both?
<A NAME="1289"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="1290"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And of two deformed things, that which exceeds in deformity 
<A NAME="1291"></A>or disgrace, exceeds either in pain or evil-must it not be 
<A NAME="1292"></A>so?
<A NAME="1293"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1294"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But then again, what was the observation which you 
<A NAME="1295"></A>just now made, about doing and suffering wrong? Did you not say, that suffering 
<A NAME="1296"></A>wrong was more evil, and doing wrong more disgraceful?
<A NAME="1297"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> I did.
<A NAME="1298"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, if doing wrong is more disgraceful than suffering, 
<A NAME="1299"></A>the more disgraceful must be more painful and must exceed in pain or in 
<A NAME="1300"></A>evil or both: does not that also follow?
<A NAME="1301"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="1302"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> First, then, let us consider whether the doing of injustice 
<A NAME="1303"></A>exceeds the suffering in the consequent pain: Do the injurers suffer more 
<A NAME="1304"></A>than the injured?
<A NAME="1305"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> No, Socrates; certainly not.
<A NAME="1306"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then they do not exceed in pain?
<A NAME="1307"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> No.
<A NAME="1308"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But if not in pain, then not in 
<A NAME="1309"></A>both?
<A NAME="1310"></A><BR><BR><B>Pol.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="1311"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then they can only exceed in the 
<A NAME="1312"></A>ot
