<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Place OF THE NARRATION: Phlius.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR><B>Echecrates.</B> Were you yourself, Phaedo, in the prison with 
<A NAME="22"></A>Socrates on the day when he drank the poison?
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaedo.</B> Yes, Echecrates, I was.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR><B>Ech.</B> I wish that you would tell me about his death. What 
<A NAME="25"></A>did he say in his last hours? We were informed that he died by taking poison, 
<A NAME="26"></A>but no one knew anything more; for no Phliasian ever goes to Athens now, 
<A NAME="27"></A>and a long time has elapsed since any Athenian found his way to Phlius, 
<A NAME="28"></A>and therefore we had no clear account.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaed.</B> Did you not hear of the proceedings at the 
<A NAME="30"></A>trial?
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR><B>Ech.</B> Yes; someone told us about the trial, and we could 
<A NAME="32"></A>not understand why, having been condemned, he was put to death, as appeared, 
<A NAME="33"></A>not at the time, but long afterwards. What was the reason of 
<A NAME="34"></A>this?
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaed.</B> An accident, Echecrates. The reason was that the 
<A NAME="36"></A>stern of the ship which the Athenians send to Delos happened to have been 
<A NAME="37"></A>crowned on the day before he was tried.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR><B>Ech.</B> What is this ship?
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaed.</B> This is the ship in which, as the Athenians say, 
<A NAME="40"></A>Theseus went to Crete when he took with him the fourteen youths, and was 
<A NAME="41"></A>the saviour of them and of himself. And they were said to have vowed to 
<A NAME="42"></A>Apollo at the time, that if they were saved they would make an annual pilgrimage 
<A NAME="43"></A>to Delos. Now this custom still continues, and the whole period of the 
<A NAME="44"></A>voyage to and from Delos, beginning when the priest of Apollo crowns the 
<A NAME="45"></A>stern of the ship, is a holy season, during which the city is not allowed 
<A NAME="46"></A>to be polluted by public executions; and often, when the vessel is detained 
<A NAME="47"></A>by adverse winds, there may be a very considerable delay. As I was saying, 
<A NAME="48"></A>the ship was crowned on the day before the trial, and this was the reason 
<A NAME="49"></A>why Socrates lay in prison and was not put to death until long after he 
<A NAME="50"></A>was condemned.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR><B>Ech.</B> What was the manner of his death, Phaedo? What was 
<A NAME="52"></A>said or done? And which of his friends had he with him? Or were they not 
<A NAME="53"></A>allowed by the authorities to be present? And did he die 
<A NAME="54"></A>alone?
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaed.</B> No; there were several of his friends with 
<A NAME="56"></A>him.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR><B>Ech.</B> If you have nothing to do, I wish that you would tell 
<A NAME="58"></A>me what passed, as exactly as you can.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaed.</B> I have nothing to do, and will try to gratify your 
<A NAME="60"></A>wish. For to me, too, there is no greater pleasure than to have Socrates 
<A NAME="61"></A>brought to my recollection, whether I speak myself or hear another speak 
<A NAME="62"></A>of him.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR><B>Ech.</B> You will have listeners who are of the same mind with 
<A NAME="64"></A>you, and I hope that you will be as exact as you can.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaed.</B> I remember the strange feeling which came over me 
<A NAME="66"></A>at being with him. For I could hardly believe that I was present at the 
<A NAME="67"></A>death of a friend, and therefore I did not pity him, Echecrates; his mien 
<A NAME="68"></A>and his language were so noble and fearless in the hour of death that to 
<A NAME="69"></A>me he appeared blessed. I thought that in going to the other world he could 
<A NAME="70"></A>not be without a divine call, and that he would be happy, if any man ever 
<A NAME="71"></A>was, when he arrived there, and therefore I did not pity him as might seem 
<A NAME="72"></A>natural at such a time. But neither could I feel the pleasure which I usually 
<A NAME="73"></A>felt in philosophical discourse (for philosophy was the theme of which 
<A NAME="74"></A>we spoke). I was pleased, and I was also pained, because I knew that he 
<A NAME="75"></A>was soon to die, and this strange mixture of feeling was shared by us all; 
<A NAME="76"></A>we were laughing and weeping by turns, especially the excitable Apollodorus-you 
<A NAME="77"></A>know the sort of man?
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR><B>Ech.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaed.</B> He was quite overcome; and I myself and all of us 
<A NAME="80"></A>were greatly moved.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR><B>Ech.</B> Who were present?
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaed.</B> Of native Athenians there were, besides Apollodorus, 
<A NAME="83"></A>Critobulus and his father Crito, Hermogenes, Epigenes, Aeschines, and Antisthenes; 
<A NAME="84"></A>likewise Ctesippus of the deme of Paeania, Menexenus, and some others; 
<A NAME="85"></A>but Plato, if I am not mistaken, was ill.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR><B>Ech.</B> Were there any strangers?
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaed.</B> Yes, there were; Simmias the Theban, and Cebes, and 
<A NAME="88"></A>Phaedondes; Euclid and Terpison, who came from Megara.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR><B>Ech.</B> And was Aristippus there, and Cleombrotus?
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaed.</B> No, they were said to be in Aegina.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR><B>Ech.</B> Anyone else?
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaed.</B> I think that these were about 
<A NAME="93"></A>all.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR><B>Ech.</B> And what was the discourse of which you 
<A NAME="95"></A>spoke?
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR><B>Phaed.</B> I will begin at the beginning, and endeavor to repeat 
<A NAME="97"></A>the entire conversation. You must understand that we had been previously 
<A NAME="98"></A>in the habit of assembling early in the morning at the court in which the 
<A NAME="99"></A>trial was held, and which is not far from the prison. There we remained 
<A NAME="100"></A>talking with one another until the opening of the prison doors (for they 
<A NAME="101"></A>were not opened very early), and then went in and generally passed the 
<A NAME="102"></A>day with Socrates. On the last morning the meeting was earlier than usual; 
<A NAME="103"></A>this was owing to our having heard on the previous evening that the sacred 
<A NAME="104"></A>ship had arrived from Delos, and therefore we agreed to meet very early 
<A NAME="105"></A>at the accustomed place. On our going to the prison, the jailer who answered 
<A NAME="106"></A>the door, instead of admitting us, came out and bade us wait and he would 
<A NAME="107"></A>call us. "For the Eleven," he said, "are now with Socrates; they are taking 
<A NAME="108"></A>off his chains, and giving orders that he is to die to-day." He soon returned 
<A NAME="109"></A>and said that we might come in. On entering we found Socrates just released 
<A NAME="110"></A>from chains, and Xanthippe, whom you know, sitting by him, and holding 
<A NAME="111"></A>his child in her arms. When she saw us she uttered a cry and said, as women 
<A NAME="112"></A>will: "O Socrates, this is the last time that either you will converse 
<A NAME="113"></A>with your friends, or they with you." Socrates turned to Crito and said: 
<A NAME="114"></A>"Crito, let someone take her home." Some of Crito's people accordingly 
<A NAME="115"></A>led her away, crying out and beating herself. And when she was gone, Socrates, 
<A NAME="116"></A>sitting up on the couch, began to bend and rub his leg, saying, as he rubbed: 
<A NAME="117"></A>"How singular is the thing called pleasure, and how curiously related to 
<A NAME="118"></A>pain, which might be thought to be the opposite of it; for they never come 
<A NAME="119"></A>to a man together, and yet he who pursues either of them is generally compelled 
<A NAME="120"></A>to take the other. They are two, and yet they grow together out of one 
<A NAME="121"></A>head or stem; and I cannot help thinking that if Aesop had noticed them, 
<A NAME="122"></A>he would have made a fable about God trying to reconcile their strife, 
<A NAME="123"></A>and when he could not, he fastened their heads together; and this is the 
<A NAME="124"></A>reason why when one comes the other follows, as I find in my own case pleasure 
<A NAME="125"></A>comes following after the pain in my leg, which was caused by the 
<A NAME="126"></A>chain."
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>Upon this Cebes said: I am very glad indeed, Socrates, that you 
<A NAME="128"></A>mentioned the name of Aesop. For that reminds me of a question which has 
<A NAME="129"></A>been asked by others, and was asked of me only the day before yesterday 
<A NAME="130"></A>by Evenus the poet, and as he will be sure to ask again, you may as well 
<A NAME="131"></A>tell me what I should say to him, if you would like him to have an answer. 
<A NAME="132"></A>He wanted to know why you who never before wrote a line of poetry, now 
<A NAME="133"></A>that you are in prison are putting Aesop into verse, and also composing 
<A NAME="134"></A>that hymn in honor of Apollo.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>Tell him, Cebes, he replied, that I had no idea of rivalling him 
<A NAME="136"></A>or his poems; which is the truth, for I knew that I could not do that. 
<A NAME="137"></A>But I wanted to see whether I could purge away a scruple which I felt about 
<A NAME="138"></A>certain dreams. In the course of my life I have often had intimations in 
<A NAME="139"></A>dreams "that I should make music." The same dream came to me sometimes 
<A NAME="140"></A>in one form, and sometimes in another, but always saying the same or nearly 
<A NAME="141"></A>the same words: Make and cultivate music, said the dream. And hitherto 
<A NAME="142"></A>I had imagined that this was only intended to exhort and encourage me in 
<A NAME="143"></A>the study of philosophy, which has always been the pursuit of my life, 
<A NAME="144"></A>and is the noblest and best of music. The dream was bidding me to do what 
<A NAME="145"></A>I was already doing, in the same way that the competitor in a race is bidden 
<A NAME="146"></A>by the spectators to run when he is already running. But I was not certain 
<A NAME="147"></A>of this, as the dream might have meant music in the popular sense of the 
<A NAME="148"></A>word, and being under sentence of death, and the festival giving me a respite, 
<A NAME="149"></A>I thought that I should be safer if I satisfied the scruple, and, in obedience 
<A NAME="150"></A>to the dream, composed a few verses before I departed. And first I made 
<A NAME="151"></A>a hymn in honor of the god of the festival, and then considering that a 
<A NAME="152"></A>poet, if he is really to be a poet or maker, should not only put words 
<A NAME="153"></A>together but make stories, and as I have no invention, I took some fables 
<A NAME="154"></A>of esop, which I had ready at hand and knew, and turned them into verse. 
<A NAME="155"></A>Tell Evenus this, and bid him be of good cheer; that I would have him come 
<A NAME="156"></A>after me if he be a wise man, and not tarry; and that to-day I am likely 
<A NAME="157"></A>to be going, for the Athenians say that I must.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>Simmias said: What a message for such a man! having been a frequent 
<A NAME="159"></A>companion of his, I should say that, as far as I know him, he will never 
<A NAME="160"></A>take your advice unless he is obliged.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>Why, said Socrates,-is not Evenus a philosopher?
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>I think that he is, said Simmias.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Then he, or any man who has the spirit of philosophy, will be willing 
<A NAME="164"></A>to die, though he will not take his own life, for that is held not to be 
<A NAME="165"></A>right.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>Here he changed his position, and put his legs off the couch on 
<A NAME="167"></A>to the ground, and during the rest of the conversation he remained 
<A NAME="168"></A>sitting.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>Why do you say, inquired Cebes, that a man ought not to take his 
<A NAME="170"></A>own life, but that the philosopher will be ready to follow the 
<A NAME="171"></A>dying?
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Socrates replied: And have you, Cebes and Simmias, who are acquainted 
<A NAME="173"></A>with Philolaus, never heard him speak of this?
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>I never understood him, Socrates.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>My words, too, are only an echo; but I am very willing to say what 
<A NAME="176"></A>I have heard: and indeed, as I am going to another place, I ought to be 
<A NAME="177"></A>thinking and talking of the nature of the pilgrimage which I am about to 
<A NAME="178"></A>make. What can I do better in the interval between this and the setting 
<A NAME="179"></A>of the sun?
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>Then tell me, Socrates, why is suicide held not to be right? as 
<A NAME="181"></A>I have certainly heard Philolaus affirm when he was staying with us at 
<A NAME="182"></A>Thebes: and there are others who say the same, although none of them has 
<A NAME="183"></A>ever made me understand him.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>But do your best, replied Socrates, and the day may come when you 
<A NAME="185"></A>will understand. I suppose that you wonder why, as most things which are 
<A NAME="186"></A>evil may be accidentally good, this is to be the only exception (for may 
<A NAME="187"></A>not death, too, be better than life in some cases?), and why, when a man 
<A NAME="188"></A>is better dead, he is not permitted to be his own benefactor, but must 
<A NAME="189"></A>wait for the hand of another.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>By Jupiter! yes, indeed, said Cebes, laughing, and speaking in 
<A NAME="191"></A>his native Doric.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>I admit the appearance of inconsistency, replied Socrates, but 
<A NAME="193"></A>there may not be any real inconsistency after all in this. There is a doctrine 
<A NAME="194"></A>uttered in secret that man is a prisoner who has no right to open the door 
<A NAME="195"></A>of his prison and run away; this is a great mystery which I do not quite 
<A NAME="196"></A>understand. Yet I, too, believe that the gods are our guardians, and that 
<A NAME="197"></A>we are a possession of theirs. Do you not agree?
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I agree to that, said Cebes.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>And if one of your own possessions, an ox or an ass, for example took 
<A NAME="200"></A>the liberty of putting himself out of the way when you had given no intimation 
<A NAME="201"></A>of your wish that he should die, would you not be angry with him, and would 
<A NAME="202"></A>you not punish him if you could?
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, replied Cebes.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Then there may be reason in saying that a man should wait, and not 
<A NAME="205"></A>take his own life until God summons him, as he is now summoning 
<A NAME="206"></A>me.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>Yes, Socrates, said Cebes, there is surely reason in that. And 
<A NAME="208"></A>yet how can you reconcile this seemingly true belief that God is our guardian 
<A NAME="209"></A>and we his possessions, with that willingness to die which we were attributing 
<A NAME="210"></A>to the philosopher? That the wisest of men should be willing to leave this 
<A NAME="211"></A>service in which they are ruled by the gods who are the best of rulers 
<A NAME="212"></A>is not reasonable, for surely no wise man thinks that when set at liberty 
<A NAME="213"></A>he can take better care of himself than the gods take of him. A fool may 
<A NAME="214"></A>perhaps think this-he may argue that he had better run away from his master, 
<A NAME="215"></A>not considering that his duty is to remain to the end, and not to run away 
<A NAME="216"></A>from the good, and that there is no sense in his running away. But the 
<A NAME="217"></A>wise man will want to be ever with him who is better than himself. Now 
<A NAME="218"></A>this, Socrates, is the reverse of what was just now said; for upon this 
<A NAME="219"></A>view the wise man should sorrow and the fool rejoice at passing out of 
<A NAME="220"></A>life.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>The earnestness of Cebes seemed to please Socrates. Here, said 
<A NAME="222"></A>he, turning to us, is a man who is always inquiring, and is not to be convinced 
<A NAME="223"></A>all in a moment, nor by every argument.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>And in this case, added Simmias, his objection does appear to me 
<A NAME="225"></A>to have some force. For what can be the meaning of a truly wise man wanting 
<A NAME="226"></A>to fly away and lightly leave a master who is better than himself? And 
<A NAME="227"></A>I rather imagine that Cebes is referring to you; he thinks that you are 
<A NAME="228"></A>too ready to leave us, and too ready to leave the gods who, as you acknowledge, 
<A NAME="229"></A>are our good rulers.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>Yes, replied Socrates; there is reason in that. And this indictment 
<A NAME="231"></A>you think that I ought to answer as if I were in court?
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>That is what we should like, said Simmias.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Then I must try to make a better impression upon you than I did when 
<A NAME="234"></A>defending myself before the judges. For I am quite ready to acknowledge, 
<A NAME="235"></A>Simmias and Cebes, that I ought to be grieved at death, if I were not persuaded 
<A NAME="236"></A>that I am going to other gods who are wise and good (of this I am as certain 
<A NAME="237"></A>as I can be of anything of the sort) and to men departed (though I am not 
<A NAME="238"></A>so certain of this), who are better than those whom I leave behind; and 
<A NAME="239"></A>therefore I do not grieve as I might have done, for I have good hope that 
<A NAME="240"></A>there is yet something remaining for the dead, and, as has been said of 
<A NAME="241"></A>old, some far better thing for the good than for the 
<A NAME="242"></A>evil.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>But do you mean to take away your thoughts with you, Socrates? 
<A NAME="244"></A>said Simmias. Will you not communicate them to us?-the benefit is one in 
<A NAME="245"></A>which we too may hope to share. Moreover, if you succeed in convincing 
<A NAME="246"></A>us, that will be an answer to the charge against yourself.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>I will do my best, replied Socrates. But you must first let me 
<A NAME="248"></A>hear what Crito wants; he was going to say something to 
<A NAME="249"></A>me.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>Only this, Socrates, replied Crito: the attendant who is to give 
<A NAME="251"></A>you the poison has been telling me that you are not to talk much, and he 
<A NAME="252"></A>wants me to let you know this; for that by talking heat is increased, and 
<A NAME="253"></A>this interferes with the action of the poison; those who excite themselves 
<A NAME="254"></A>are sometimes obliged to drink the poison two or three 
<A NAME="255"></A>times.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>Then, said Socrates, let him mind his business and be prepared 
<A NAME="257"></A>to give the poison two or three times, if necessary; that is 
<A NAME="258"></A>all.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>I was almost certain that you would say that, replied Crito; but 
<A NAME="260"></A>I was obliged to satisfy him.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>Never mind him, he said.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>And now I will make answer to you, O my judges, and show that he who 
<A NAME="263"></A>has lived as a true philosopher has reason to be of good cheer when he 
<A NAME="264"></A>is about to die, and that after death he may hope to receive the greatest 
<A NAME="265"></A>good in the other world. And how this may be, Simmias and Cebes, I will 
<A NAME="266"></A>endeavor to explain. For I deem that the true disciple of philosophy is 
<A NAME="267"></A>likely to be misunderstood by other men; they do not perceive that he is 
<A NAME="268"></A>ever pursuing death and dying; and if this is true, why, having had the 
<A NAME="269"></A>desire of death all his life long, should he repine at the arrival of that 
<A NAME="270"></A>which he has been always pursuing and desiring?
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>Simmias laughed and said: Though not in a laughing humor, I swear 
<A NAME="272"></A>that I cannot help laughing when I think what the wicked world will say 
<A NAME="273"></A>when they hear this. They will say that this is very true, and our people 
<A NAME="274"></A>at home will agree with them in saying that the life which philosophers 
<A NAME="275"></A>desire is truly death, and that they have found them out to be deserving 
<A NAME="276"></A>of the death which they desire.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>And they are right, Simmias, in saying this, with the exception 
<A NAME="278"></A>of the words "They have found them out"; for they have not found out what 
<A NAME="279"></A>is the nature of this death which the true philosopher desires, or how 
<A NAME="280"></A>he deserves or desires death. But let us leave them and have a word with 
<A NAME="281"></A>ourselves: Do we believe that there is such a thing as 
<A NAME="282"></A>death?
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>To be sure, replied Simmias.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>And is this anything but the separation of soul and body? And being 
<A NAME="285"></A>dead is the attainment of this separation; when the soul exists in herself, 
<A NAME="286"></A>and is parted from the body and the body is parted from the soul-that is 
<A NAME="287"></A>death?
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR><B>Exactly:</B> that and nothing else, he replied.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>And what do you say of another question, my friend, about which I should 
<A NAME="290"></A>like to have your opinion, and the answer to which will probably throw 
<A NAME="291"></A>light on our present inquiry: Do you think that the philosopher ought to 
<A NAME="292"></A>care about the pleasures-if they are to be called pleasures-of eating and 
<A NAME="293"></A>drinking?
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not, answered Simmias.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>And what do you say of the pleasures of love-should he care about 
<A NAME="296"></A>them?
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>By no means.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>And will he think much of the other ways of indulging the body-for 
<A NAME="299"></A>example, the acquisition of costly raiment, or sandals, or other adornments 
<A NAME="300"></A>of the body? Instead of caring about them, does he not rather despise anything 
<A NAME="301"></A>more than nature needs? What do you say?
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>I should say the true philosopher would despise 
<A NAME="303"></A>them.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>Would you not say that he is entirely concerned with the soul and not 
<A NAME="305"></A>with the body? He would like, as far as he can, to be quit of the body 
<A NAME="306"></A>and turn to the soul.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>In matters of this sort philosophers, above all other men, may be observed 
<A NAME="309"></A>in every sort of way to dissever the soul from the body.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Whereas, Simmias, the rest of the world are of opinion that a life 
<A NAME="312"></A>which has no bodily pleasures and no part in them is not worth having; 
<A NAME="313"></A>but that he who thinks nothing of bodily pleasures is almost as though 
<A NAME="314"></A>he were dead.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>That is quite true.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>What again shall we say of the actual acquirement of knowledge?-is 
<A NAME="317"></A>the body, if invited to share in the inquiry, a hinderer or a helper? I 
<A NAME="318"></A>mean to say, have sight and hearing any truth in them? Are they not, as 
<A NAME="319"></A>the poets are always telling us, inaccurate witnesses? and yet, if even 
<A NAME="320"></A>they are inaccurate and indistinct, what is to be said of the other senses?-for 
<A NAME="321"></A>you will allow that they are the best of them?
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he replied.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Then when does the soul attain truth?-for in attempting to consider 
<A NAME="324"></A>anything in company with the body she is obviously deceived.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that is true.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Then must not existence be revealed to her in thought, if at 
<A NAME="327"></A>all?
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>And thought is best when the mind is gathered into herself and none 
<A NAME="330"></A>of these things trouble her-neither sounds nor sights nor pain nor any 
<A NAME="331"></A>pleasure-when she has as little as possible to do with the body, and has 
<A NAME="332"></A>no bodily sense or feeling, but is aspiring after being?
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>And in this the philosopher dishonors the body; his soul runs away 
<A NAME="335"></A>from the body and desires to be alone and by herself?
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Well, but there is another thing, Simmias: Is there or is there not 
<A NAME="338"></A>an absolute justice?
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>Assuredly there is.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>And an absolute beauty and absolute good?
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>But did you ever behold any of them with your eyes?
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Or did you ever reach them with any other bodily sense? (and I speak 
<A NAME="345"></A>not of these alone, but of absolute greatness, and health, and strength, 
<A NAME="346"></A>and of the essence or true nature of everything). Has the reality of them 
<A NAME="347"></A>ever been perceived by you through the bodily organs? or rather, is not 
<A NAME="348"></A>the nearest approach to the knowledge of their several natures made by 
<A NAME="349"></A>him who so orders his intellectual vision as to have the most exact conception 
<A NAME="350"></A>of the essence of that which he considers?
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>And he attains to the knowledge of them in their highest purity who 
<A NAME="353"></A>goes to each of them with the mind alone, not allowing when in the act 
<A NAME="354"></A>of thought the intrusion or introduction of sight or any other sense in 
<A NAME="355"></A>the company of reason, but with the very light of the mind in her clearness 
<A NAME="356"></A>penetrates into the very fight of truth in each; he has got rid, as far 
<A NAME="357"></A>as he can, of eyes and ears and of the whole body, which he conceives of 
<A NAME="358"></A>only as a disturbing element, hindering the soul from the acquisition of 
<A NAME="359"></A>knowledge when in company with her-is not this the sort of man who, if 
<A NAME="360"></A>ever man did, is likely to attain the knowledge of existence?
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>There is admirable truth in that, Socrates, replied 
<A NAME="362"></A>Simmias.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>And when they consider all this, must not true philosophers make a 
<A NAME="364"></A>reflection, of which they will speak to one another in such words as these: 
<A NAME="365"></A>We have found, they will say, a path of speculation which seems to bring 
<A NAME="366"></A>us and the argument to the conclusion that while we are in the body, and 
<A NAME="367"></A>while the soul is mingled with this mass of evil, our desire will not be 
<A NAME="368"></A>satisfied, and our desire is of the truth. For the body is a source of 
<A NAME="369"></A>endless trouble to us by reason of the mere requirement of food; and also 
<A NAME="370"></A>is liable to diseases which overtake and impede us in the search after 
<A NAME="371"></A>truth: and by filling us so full of loves, and lusts, and fears, and fancies, 
<A NAME="372"></A>and idols, and every sort of folly, prevents our ever having, as people 
<A NAME="373"></A>say, so much as a thought. For whence come wars, and fightings, and factions? 
<A NAME="374"></A>whence but from the body and the lusts of the body? For wars are occasioned 
<A NAME="375"></A>by the love of money, and money has to be acquired for the sake and in 
<A NAME="376"></A>the service of the body; and in consequence of all these things the time 
<A NAME="377"></A>which ought to be given to philosophy is lost. Moreover, if there is time 
<A NAME="378"></A>and an inclination toward philosophy, yet the body introduces a turmoil 
<A NAME="379"></A>and confusion and fear into the course of speculation, and hinders us from 
<A NAME="380"></A>seeing the truth: and all experience shows that if we would have pure knowledge 
<A NAME="381"></A>of anything we must be quit of the body, and the soul in herself must behold 
<A NAME="382"></A>all things in themselves: then I suppose that we shall attain that which 
<A NAME="383"></A>we desire, and of which we say that we are lovers, and that is wisdom, 
<A NAME="384"></A>not while we live, but after death, as the argument shows; for if while 
<A NAME="385"></A>in company with the body the soul cannot have pure knowledge, one of two 
<A NAME="386"></A>things seems to follow-either knowledge is not to be attained at all, or, 
<A NAME="387"></A>if at all, after death. For then, and not till then, the soul will be in 
<A NAME="388"></A>herself alone and without the body. In this present life, I reckon that 
<A NAME="389"></A>we make the nearest approach to knowledge when we have the least possible 
<A NAME="390"></A>concern or interest in the body, and are not saturated with the bodily 
<A NAME="391"></A>nature, but remain pure until the hour when God himself is pleased to release 
<A NAME="392"></A>us. And then the foolishness of the body will be cleared away and we shall 
<A NAME="393"></A>be pure and hold converse with other pure souls, and know of ourselves 
<A NAME="394"></A>the clear light everywhere; and this is surely the light of truth. For 
<A NAME="395"></A>no impure thing is allowed to approach the pure. These are the sort of 
<A NAME="396"></A>words, Simmias, which the true lovers of wisdom cannot help saying to one 
<A NAME="397"></A>another, and thinking. You will agree with me in that?
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, Socrates.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>But if this is true, O my friend, then there is great hope that, going 
<A NAME="400"></A>whither I go, I shall there be satisfied with that which has been the chief 
<A NAME="401"></A>concern of you and me in our past lives. And now that the hour of departure 
<A NAME="402"></A>is appointed to me, this is the hope with which I depart, and not I only, 
<A NAME="403"></A>but every man who believes that he has his mind purified.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, replied Simmias.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>And what is purification but the separation of the soul from the body, 
<A NAME="406"></A>as I was saying before; the habit of the soul gathering and collecting 
<A NAME="407"></A>herself into herself, out of all the courses of the body; the dwelling 
<A NAME="408"></A>in her own place alone, as in another life, so also in this, as far as 
<A NAME="409"></A>she can; the release of the soul from the chains of the 
<A NAME="410"></A>body?
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>And what is that which is termed death, but this very separation and 
<A NAME="413"></A>release of the soul from the body?
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>To be sure, he said.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>And the true philosophers, and they only, study and are eager to release 
<A NAME="416"></A>the soul. Is not the separation and release of the soul from the body their 
<A NAME="417"></A>especial study?
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>And as I was saying at first, there would be a ridiculous contradiction 
<A NAME="420"></A>in men studying to live as nearly as they can in a state of death, and 
<A NAME="421"></A>yet repining when death comes.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Then, Simmias, as the true philosophers are ever studying death, to 
<A NAME="424"></A>them, of all men, death is the least terrible. Look at the matter in this 
<A NAME="425"></A>way: how inconsistent of them to have been always enemies of the body, 
<A NAME="426"></A>and wanting to have the soul alone, and when this is granted to them, to 
<A NAME="427"></A>be trembling and repining; instead of rejoicing at their departing to that 
<A NAME="428"></A>place where, when they arrive, they hope to gain that which in life they 
<A NAME="429"></A>loved (and this was wisdom), and at the same time to be rid of the company 
<A NAME="430"></A>of their enemy. Many a man has been willing to go to the world below in 
<A NAME="431"></A>the hope of seeing there an earthly love, or wife, or son, and conversing 
<A NAME="432"></A>with them. And will he who is a true lover of wisdom, and is persuaded 
<A NAME="433"></A>in like manner that only in the world below he can worthily enjoy her, 
<A NAME="434"></A>still repine at death? Will he not depart with joy? Surely he will, my 
<A NAME="435"></A>friend, if he be a true philosopher. For he will have a firm conviction 
<A NAME="436"></A>that there only, and nowhere else, he can find wisdom in her purity. And 
<A NAME="437"></A>if this be true, he would be very absurd, as I was saying, if he were to 
<A NAME="438"></A>fear death.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>He would, indeed, replied Simmias.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>And when you see a man who is repining at the approach of death, is 
<A NAME="441"></A>not his reluctance a sufficient proof that he is not a lover of wisdom, 
<A NAME="442"></A>but a lover of the body, and probably at the same time a lover of either 
<A NAME="443"></A>money or power, or both?
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>That is very true, he replied.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>There is a virtue, Simmias, which is named courage. Is not that a special 
<A NAME="446"></A>attribute of the philosopher?
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Again, there is temperance. Is not the calm, and control, and disdain 
<A NAME="449"></A>of the passions which even the many call temperance, a quality belonging 
<A NAME="450"></A>only to those who despise the body and live in philosophy?
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>That is not to be denied.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>For the courage and temperance of other men, if you will consider them, 
<A NAME="453"></A>are really a contradiction.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>How is that, Socrates?
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>Well, he said, you are aware that death is regarded by men in general 
<A NAME="456"></A>as a great evil.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>That is true, he said.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>And do not courageous men endure death because they are afraid of yet 
<A NAME="459"></A>greater evils?
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Then all but the philosophers are courageous only from fear, and because 
<A NAME="462"></A>they are afraid; and yet that a man should be courageous from fear, and 
<A NAME="463"></A>because he is a coward, is surely a strange thing.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>And are not the temperate exactly in the same case? They are temperate 
<A NAME="466"></A>because they are intemperate-which may seem to be a contradiction, but 
<A NAME="467"></A>is nevertheless the sort of thing which happens with this foolish temperance. 
<A NAME="468"></A>For there are pleasures which they must have, and are afraid of losing; 
<A NAME="469"></A>and therefore they abstain from one class of pleasures because they are 
<A NAME="470"></A>overcome by another: and whereas intemperance is defined as "being under 
<A NAME="471"></A>the dominion of pleasure," they overcome only because they are overcome 
<A NAME="472"></A>by pleasure. And that is what I mean by saying that they are temperate 
<A NAME="473"></A>through intemperance.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>That appears to be true.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Yet the exchange of one fear or pleasure or pain for another fear or 
<A NAME="476"></A>pleasure or pain, which are measured like coins, the greater with the less, 
<A NAME="477"></A>is not the exchange of virtue. O my dear Simmias, is there not one true 
<A NAME="478"></A>coin for which all things ought to exchange?-and that is wisdom; and only 
<A NAME="479"></A>in exchange for this, and in company with this, is anything truly bought 
<A NAME="480"></A>or sold, whether courage or temperance or justice. And is not all true 
<A NAME="481"></A>virtue the companion of wisdom, no matter what fears or pleasures or other 
<A NAME="482"></A>similar goods or evils may or may not attend her? But the virtue which 
<A NAME="483"></A>is made up of these goods, when they are severed from wisdom and exchanged 
<A NAME="484"></A>with one another, is a shadow of virtue only, nor is there any freedom 
<A NAME="485"></A>or health or truth in her; but in the true exchange there is a purging 
<A NAME="486"></A>away of all these things, and temperance, and justice, and courage, and 
<A NAME="487"></A>wisdom herself are a purgation of them. And I conceive that the founders 
<A NAME="488"></A>of the mysteries had a real meaning and were not mere triflers when they 
<A NAME="489"></A>intimated in a figure long ago that he who passes unsanctified and uninitiated 
<A NAME="490"></A>into the world below will live in a slough, but that he who arrives there 
<A NAME="491"></A>after initiation and purification will dwell with the gods. For "many," 
<A NAME="492"></A>as they say in the mysteries, "are the thyrsus bearers, but few are the 
<A NAME="493"></A>mystics,"-meaning, as I interpret the words, the true philosophers. In 
<A NAME="494"></A>the number of whom I have been seeking, according to my ability, to find 
<A NAME="495"></A>a place during my whole life; whether I have sought in a right way or not, 
<A NAME="496"></A>and whether I have succeeded or not, I shall truly know in a little while, 
<A NAME="497"></A>if God will, when I myself arrive in the other world: that is my belief. 
<A NAME="498"></A>And now, Simmias and Cebes, I have answered those who charge me with not 
<A NAME="499"></A>grieving or repining at parting from you and my masters in this world; 
<A NAME="500"></A>and I am right in not repining, for I believe that I shall find other masters 
<A NAME="501"></A>and friends who are as good in the world below. But all men cannot believe 
<A NAME="502"></A>this, and I shall be glad if my words have any more success with you than 
<A NAME="503"></A>with the judges of the Athenians.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>Cebes answered: I agree, Socrates, in the greater part of what 
<A NAME="505"></A>you say. But in what relates to the soul, men are apt to be incredulous; 
<A NAME="506"></A>they fear that when she leaves the body her place may be nowhere, and that 
<A NAME="507"></A>on the very day of death she may be destroyed and perish-immediately on 
<A NAME="508"></A>her release from the body, issuing forth like smoke or air and vanishing 
<A NAME="509"></A>away into nothingness. For if she could only hold together and be herself 
<A NAME="510"></A>after she was released from the evils of the body, there would be good 
<A NAME="511"></A>reason to hope, Socrates, that what you say is true. But much persuasion 
<A NAME="512"></A>and many arguments are required in order to prove that when the man is 
<A NAME="513"></A>dead the soul yet exists, and has any force of intelligence.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR>True, Cebes, said Socrates; and shall I suggest that we talk a 
<A NAME="515"></A>little of the probabilities of these things?
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>I am sure, said Cebes, that I should gready like to know your opinion 
<A NAME="517"></A>about them.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>I reckon, said Socrates, that no one who heard me now, not even 
<A NAME="519"></A>if he were one of my old enemies, the comic poets, could accuse me of idle 
<A NAME="520"></A>talking about matters in which I have no concern. Let us, then, if you 
<A NAME="521"></A>please, proceed with the inquiry.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>Whether the souls of men after death are or are not in the world 
<A NAME="523"></A>below, is a question which may be argued in this manner: The ancient doctrine 
<A NAME="524"></A>of which I have been speaking affirms that they go from this into the other 
<A NAME="525"></A>world, and return hither, and are born from the dead. Now if this be true, 
<A NAME="526"></A>and the living come from the dead, then our souls must be in the other 
<A NAME="527"></A>world, for if not, how could they be born again? And this would be conclusive, 
<A NAME="528"></A>if there were any real evidence that the living are only born from the 
<A NAME="529"></A>dead; but if there is no evidence of this, then other arguments will have 
<A NAME="530"></A>to be adduced.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>That is very true, replied Cebes.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Then let us consider this question, not in relation to man only, but 
<A NAME="533"></A>in relation to animals generally, and to plants, and to everything of which 
<A NAME="534"></A>there is generation, and the proof will be easier. Are not all things which 
<A NAME="535"></A>have opposites generated out of their opposites? I mean such things as 
<A NAME="536"></A>good and evil, just and unjust-and there are innumerable other opposites 
<A NAME="537"></A>which are generated out of opposites. And I want to show that this holds 
<A NAME="538"></A>universally of all opposites; I mean to say, for example, that anything 
<A NAME="539"></A>which becomes greater must become greater after being 
<A NAME="540"></A>less.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>And that which becomes less must have been once greater and then become 
<A NAME="543"></A>less.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>And the weaker is generated from the stronger, and the swifter from 
<A NAME="546"></A>the slower.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>And the worse is from the better, and the more just is from the more 
<A NAME="549"></A>unjust.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>And is this true of all opposites? and are we convinced that all of 
<A NAME="552"></A>them are generated out of opposites?
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>And in this universal opposition of all things, are there not also 
<A NAME="555"></A>two intermediate processes which are ever going on, from one to the other, 
<A NAME="556"></A>and back again; where there is a greater and a less there is also an intermediate 
<A NAME="557"></A>process of increase and diminution, and that which grows is said to wax, 
<A NAME="558"></A>and that which decays to wane?
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>And there are many other processes, such as division and composition, 
<A NAME="561"></A>cooling and heating, which equally involve a passage into and out of one 
<A NAME="562"></A>another. And this holds of all opposites, even though not always expressed 
<A NAME="563"></A>in words-they are generated out of one another, and there is a passing 
<A NAME="564"></A>or process from one to the other of them?
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he replied.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Well, and is there not an opposite of life, as sleep is the opposite 
<A NAME="567"></A>of waking?
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>And what is that?
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Death, he answered.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>And these, then, are generated, if they are opposites, the one from 
<A NAME="572"></A>the other, and have there their two intermediate processes 
<A NAME="573"></A>also?
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Now, said Socrates, I will analyze one of the two pairs of opposites 
<A NAME="576"></A>which I have mentioned to you, and also its intermediate processes, and 
<A NAME="577"></A>you shall analyze the other to me. The state of sleep is opposed to the 
<A NAME="578"></A>state of waking, and out of sleeping waking is generated, and out of waking, 
<A NAME="579"></A>sleeping, and the process of generation is in the one case falling asleep, 
<A NAME="580"></A>and in the other waking up. Are you agreed about that?
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR>Quite agreed.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Then suppose that you analyze life and death to me in the same manner. 
<A NAME="583"></A>Is not death opposed to life?
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>And they are generated one from the other?
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>What is generated from life?
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Death.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>And what from death?
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>I can only say in answer-life.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>Then the living, whether things or persons, Cebes, are generated from 
<A NAME="592"></A>the dead?
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR>That is clear, he replied.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Then the inference is, that our souls are in the world 
<A NAME="595"></A>below?
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>And one of the two processes or generations is visible-for surely the 
<A NAME="598"></A>act of dying is visible?
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>Surely, he said.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>And may not the other be inferred as the complement of nature, who 
<A NAME="601"></A>is not to be supposed to go on one leg only? And if not, a corresponding 
<A NAME="602"></A>process of generation in death must also be assigned to 
<A NAME="603"></A>her?
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he replied.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>And what is that process?
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Revival.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>And revival, if there be such a thing, is the birth of the dead into 
<A NAME="608"></A>the world of the living?
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR>Quite true.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Then there is a new way in which we arrive at the inference that the 
<A NAME="611"></A>living come from the dead, just as the dead come from the living; and if 
<A NAME="612"></A>this is true, then the souls of the dead must be in some place out of which 
<A NAME="613"></A>they come again. And this, as I think, has been satisfactorily 
<A NAME="614"></A>proved.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>Yes, Socrates, he said; all this seems to flow necessarily out 
<A NAME="616"></A>of our previous admissions.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR>And that these admissions are not unfair, Cebes, he said, may be 
<A NAME="618"></A>shown, as I think, in this way: If generation were in a straight line only, 
<A NAME="619"></A>and there were no compensation or circle in nature, no turn or return into 
<A NAME="620"></A>one another, then you know that all things would at last have the same 
<A NAME="621"></A>form and pass into the same state, and there would be no more generation 
<A NAME="622"></A>of them.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean? he said.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>A simple thing enough, which I will illustrate by the case of sleep, 
<A NAME="625"></A>he replied. You know that if there were no compensation of sleeping and 
<A NAME="626"></A>waking, the story of the sleeping Endymion would in the end have no meaning, 
<A NAME="627"></A>because all other things would be asleep, too, and he would not be thought 
<A NAME="628"></A>of. Or if there were composition only, and no division of substances, then 
<A NAME="629"></A>the chaos of Anaxagoras would come again. And in like manner, my dear Cebes, 
<A NAME="630"></A>if all things which partook of life were to die, and after they were dead 
<A NAME="631"></A>remained in the form of death, and did not come to life again, all would 
<A NAME="632"></A>at last die, and nothing would be alive-how could this be otherwise? For 
<A NAME="633"></A>if the living spring from any others who are not the dead, and they die, 
<A NAME="634"></A>must not all things at last be swallowed up in death?
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>There is no escape from that, Socrates, said Cebes; and I think 
<A NAME="636"></A>that what you say is entirely true.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, Cebes, I entirely think so, too; and we are not walking 
<A NAME="638"></A>in a vain imagination; but I am confident in the belief that there truly 
<A NAME="639"></A>is such a thing as living again, and that the living spring from the dead, 
<A NAME="640"></A>and that the souls of the dead are in existence, and that the good souls 
<A NAME="641"></A>have a better portion than the evil.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR><BR>Cebes added: Your favorite doctrine, Socrates, that knowledge is 
<A NAME="643"></A>simply recollection, if true, also necessarily implies a previous time 
<A NAME="644"></A>in which we learned that which we now recollect. But this would be impossible 
<A NAME="645"></A>unless our soul was in some place before existing in the human form; here, 
<A NAME="646"></A>then, is another argument of the soul's immortality.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR>But tell me, Cebes, said Simmias, interposing, what proofs are 
<A NAME="648"></A>given of this doctrine of recollection? I am not very sure at this moment 
<A NAME="649"></A>that I remember them.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>One excellent proof, said Cebes, is afforded by questions. If you 
<A NAME="651"></A>put a question to a person in a right way, he will give a true answer of 
<A NAME="652"></A>himself; but how could he do this unless there were knowledge and right 
<A NAME="653"></A>reason already in him? And this is most clearly shown when he is taken 
<A NAME="654"></A>to a diagram or to anything of that sort.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>But if, said Socrates, you are still incredulous, Simmias, I would 
<A NAME="656"></A>ask you whether you may not agree with me when you look at the matter in 
<A NAME="657"></A>another way; I mean, if you are still incredulous as to whether knowledge 
<A NAME="658"></A>is recollection.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR>Incredulous, I am not, said Simmias; but I want to have this doctrine 
<A NAME="660"></A>of recollection brought to my own recollection, and, from what Cebes has 
<A NAME="661"></A>said, I am beginning to recollect and be convinced; but I should still 
<A NAME="662"></A>like to hear what more you have to say.
<A NAME="663"></A><BR><BR>This is what I would say, he replied: We should agree, if I am 
<A NAME="664"></A>not mistaken, that what a man recollects he must have known at some previous 
<A NAME="665"></A>time.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>And what is the nature of this recollection? And, in asking this, I 
<A NAME="668"></A>mean to ask whether, when a person has already seen or heard or in any 
<A NAME="669"></A>way perceived anything, and he knows not only that, but something else 
<A NAME="670"></A>of which he has not the same, but another knowledge, we may not fairly 
<A NAME="671"></A>say that he recollects that which comes into his mind. Are we agreed about 
<A NAME="672"></A>that?
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean?
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>I mean what I may illustrate by the following instance: The knowledge 
<A NAME="675"></A>of a lyre is not the same as the knowledge of a man?
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>And yet what is the feeling of lovers when they recognize a lyre, or 
<A NAME="678"></A>a garment, or anything else which the beloved has been in the habit of 
<A NAME="679"></A>using? Do not they, from knowing the lyre, form in the mind's eye an image 
<A NAME="680"></A>of the youth to whom the lyre belongs? And this is recollection: and in 
<A NAME="681"></A>the same way anyone who sees Simmias may remember Cebes; and there are 
<A NAME="682"></A>endless other things of the same nature.
<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR>Yes, indeed, there are-endless, replied Simmias.
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>And this sort of thing, he said, is recollection, and is most commonly 
<A NAME="685"></A>a process of recovering that which has been forgotten through time and 
<A NAME="686"></A>inattention.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>Well; and may you not also from seeing the picture of a horse or a 
<A NAME="689"></A>lyre remember a man? and from the picture of Simmias, you may be led to 
<A NAME="690"></A>remember Cebes?
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>Or you may also be led to the recollection of Simmias 
<A NAME="693"></A>himself?
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>And in all these cases, the recollection may be derived from things 
<A NAME="696"></A>either like or unlike?
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>And when the recollection is derived from like things, then there is 
<A NAME="699"></A>sure to be another question, which is, whether the likeness of that which 
<A NAME="700"></A>is recollected is in any way defective or not.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>And shall we proceed a step further, and affirm that there is such 
<A NAME="703"></A>a thing as equality, not of wood with wood, or of stone with stone, but 
<A NAME="704"></A>that, over and above this, there is equality in the abstract? Shall we 
<A NAME="705"></A>affirm this?
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR>Affirm, yes, and swear to it, replied Simmias, with all the confidence 
<A NAME="707"></A>in life.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>And do we know the nature of this abstract essence?
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>To be sure, he said.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>And whence did we obtain this knowledge? Did we not see equalities 
<A NAME="711"></A>of material things, such as pieces of wood and stones, and gather from 
<A NAME="712"></A>them the idea of an equality which is different from them?-you will admit 
<A NAME="713"></A>that? Or look at the matter again in this way: Do not the same pieces of 
<A NAME="714"></A>wood or stone appear at one time equal, and at another time 
<A NAME="715"></A>unequal?
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR>That is certain.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>But are real equals ever unequal? or is the idea of equality ever 
<A NAME="718"></A>inequality?
<A NAME="719"></A><BR><BR>That surely was never yet known, Socrates.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>Then these (so-called) equals are not the same with the idea of 
<A NAME="721"></A>equality?
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>I should say, clearly not, Socrates.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>And yet from these equals, although differing from the idea of equality, 
<A NAME="724"></A>you conceived and attained that idea?
<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Which might be like, or might be unlike them?
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>But that makes no difference; whenever from seeing one thing you conceived 
<A NAME="729"></A>another, whether like or unlike, there must surely have been an act of 
<A NAME="730"></A>recollection?
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>But what would you say of equal portions of wood and stone, or other 
<A NAME="733"></A>material equals? and what is the impression produced by them? Are they 
<A NAME="734"></A>equals in the same sense as absolute equality? or do they fall short of 
<A NAME="735"></A>this in a measure?
<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, in a very great measure, too.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>And must we not allow that when I or anyone look at any object, and 
<A NAME="738"></A>perceive that the object aims at being some other thing, but falls short 
<A NAME="739"></A>of, and cannot attain to it-he who makes this observation must have had 
<A NAME="740"></A>previous knowledge of that to which, as he says, the other, although similar, 
<A NAME="741"></A>was inferior?
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>And has not this been our case in the matter of equals and of absolute 
<A NAME="744"></A>equality?
<A NAME="745"></A><BR><BR>Precisely.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>Then we must have known absolute equality previously to the time when 
<A NAME="747"></A>we first saw the material equals, and reflected that all these apparent 
<A NAME="748"></A>equals aim at this absolute equality, but fall short of 
<A NAME="749"></A>it?
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>And we recognize also that this absolute equality has only been known, 
<A NAME="752"></A>and can only be known, through the medium of sight or touch, or of some 
<A NAME="753"></A>other sense. And this I would affirm of all such conceptions.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>Yes, Socrates, as far as the argument is concerned, one of them 
<A NAME="755"></A>is the same as the other.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>And from the senses, then, is derived the knowledge that all sensible 
<A NAME="757"></A>things aim at an idea of equality of which they fall short-is not that 
<A NAME="758"></A>true?
<A NAME="759"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Then before we began to see or hear or perceive in any way, we must 
<A NAME="761"></A>have had a knowledge of absolute equality, or we could not have referred 
<A NAME="762"></A>to that the equals which are derived from the senses-for to that they all 
<A NAME="763"></A>aspire, and of that they fall short?
<A NAME="764"></A><BR><BR>That, Socrates, is certainly to be inferred from the previous 
<A NAME="765"></A>statements.
<A NAME="766"></A><BR><BR>And did we not see and hear and acquire our other senses as soon 
<A NAME="767"></A>as we were born?
<A NAME="768"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Then we must have acquired the knowledge of the ideal equal at some 
<A NAME="770"></A>time previous to this?
<A NAME="771"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>That is to say, before we were born, I suppose?
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>And if we acquired this knowledge before we were born, and were born 
<A NAME="775"></A>having it, then we also knew before we were born and at the instant of 
<A NAME="776"></A>birth not only equal or the greater or the less, but all other ideas; for 
<A NAME="777"></A>we are not speaking only of equality absolute, but of beauty, goodness, 
<A NAME="778"></A>justice, holiness, and all which we stamp with the name of essence in the 
<A NAME="779"></A>dialectical process, when we ask and answer questions. Of all this we may 
<A NAME="780"></A>certainly affirm that we acquired the knowledge before 
<A NAME="781"></A>birth?
<A NAME="782"></A><BR><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>But if, after having acquired, we have not forgotten that which we 
<A NAME="784"></A>acquired, then we must always have been born with knowledge, and shall 
<A NAME="785"></A>always continue to know as long as life lasts-for knowing is the acquiring 
<A NAME="786"></A>and retaining knowledge and not forgetting. Is not forgetting, Simmias, 
<A NAME="787"></A>just the losing of knowledge?
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR>Quite true, Socrates.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>But if the knowledge which we acquired before birth was lost by us 
<A NAME="790"></A>at birth, and afterwards by the use of the senses we recovered that which 
<A NAME="791"></A>we previously knew, will not that which we call learning be a process of 
<A NAME="792"></A>recovering our knowledge, and may not this be rightly termed recollection 
<A NAME="793"></A>by us?
<A NAME="794"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>For this is clear, that when we perceived something, either by the 
<A NAME="796"></A>help of sight or hearing, or some other sense, there was no difficulty 
<A NAME="797"></A>in receiving from this a conception of some other thing like or unlike 
<A NAME="798"></A>which had been forgotten and which was associated with this; and therefore, 
<A NAME="799"></A>as I was saying, one of two alternatives follows: either we had this knowledge 
<A NAME="800"></A>at birth, and continued to know through life; or, after birth, those who 
<A NAME="801"></A>are said to learn only remember, and learning is recollection 
<A NAME="802"></A>only.
<A NAME="803"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that is quite true, Socrates.
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>And which alternative, Simmias, do you prefer? Had we the knowledge 
<A NAME="805"></A>at our birth, or did we remember afterwards the things which we knew previously 
<A NAME="806"></A>to our birth?
<A NAME="807"></A><BR><BR>I cannot decide at the moment.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>At any rate you can decide whether he who has knowledge ought or ought 
<A NAME="809"></A>not to be able to give a reason for what he knows.
<A NAME="810"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he ought.
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>But do you think that every man is able to give a reason about these 
<A NAME="812"></A>very matters of which we are speaking?
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR>I wish that they could, Socrates, but I greatly fear that to-morrow 
<A NAME="814"></A>at this time there will be no one able to give a reason worth 
<A NAME="815"></A>having.
<A NAME="816"></A><BR><BR>Then you are not of opinion, Simmias, that all men know these 
<A NAME="817"></A>things?
<A NAME="818"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>Then they are in process of recollecting that which they learned 
<A NAME="820"></A>before.
<A NAME="821"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>But when did our souls acquire this knowledge?-not since we were born 
<A NAME="823"></A>as men?
<A NAME="824"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>And therefore previously?
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>Then, Simmias, our souls must have existed before they were in the 
<A NAME="828"></A>form of man-without bodies, and must have had intelligence.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><BR>Unless indeed you suppose, Socrates, that these notions were given 
<A NAME="830"></A>us at the moment of birth; for this is the only time that 
<A NAME="831"></A>remains.
<A NAME="832"></A><BR><BR>Yes, my friend, but when did we lose them? for they are not in 
<A NAME="833"></A>us when we are born-that is admitted. Did we lose them at the moment of 
<A NAME="834"></A>receiving them, or at some other time?
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>No, Socrates, I perceive that I was unconsciously talking 
<A NAME="836"></A>nonsense.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>Then may we not say, Simmias, that if, as we are always repeating, 
<A NAME="838"></A>there is an absolute beauty, and goodness, and essence in general, and 
<A NAME="839"></A>to this, which is now discovered to be a previous condition of our being, 
<A NAME="840"></A>we refer all our sensations, and with this compare them-assuming this to 
<A NAME="841"></A>have a prior existence, then our souls must have had a prior existence, 
<A NAME="842"></A>but if not, there would be no force in the argument? There can be no doubt 
<A NAME="843"></A>that if these absolute ideas existed before we were born, then our souls 
<A NAME="844"></A>must have existed before we were born, and if not the ideas, then not the 
<A NAME="845"></A>souls.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR><BR>Yes, Socrates; I am convinced that there is precisely the same 
<A NAME="847"></A>necessity for the existence of the soul before birth, and of the essence 
<A NAME="848"></A>of which you are speaking: and the argument arrives at a result which happily 
<A NAME="849"></A>agrees with my own notion. For there is nothing which to my mind is so 
<A NAME="850"></A>evident as that beauty, goodness, and other notions of which you were just 
<A NAME="851"></A>now speaking have a most real and absolute existence; and I am satisfied 
<A NAME="852"></A>with the proof.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR>Well, but is Cebes equally satisfied? for I must convince him 
<A NAME="854"></A>too.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>I think, said Simmias, that Cebes is satisfied: although he is the 
<A NAME="856"></A>most incredulous of mortals, yet I believe that he is convinced of the 
<A NAME="857"></A>existence of the soul before birth. But that after death the soul will 
<A NAME="858"></A>continue to exist is not yet proven even to my own satisfaction. I cannot 
<A NAME="859"></A>get rid of the feeling of the many to which Cebes was referring-the feeling 
<A NAME="860"></A>that when the man dies the soul may be scattered, and that this may be 
<A NAME="861"></A>the end of her. For admitting that she may be generated and created in 
<A NAME="862"></A>some other place, and may have existed before entering the human body, 
<A NAME="863"></A>why after having entered in and gone out again may she not herself be destroyed 
<A NAME="864"></A>and come to an end?
<A NAME="865"></A><BR><BR>Very true, Simmias, said Cebes; that our soul existed before we 
<A NAME="866"></A>were born was the first half of the argument, and this appears to have 
<A NAME="867"></A>been proven; that the soul will exist after death as well as before birth 
<A NAME="868"></A>is the other half of which the proof is still wanting, and has to be 
<A NAME="869"></A>supplied.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR>But that proof, Simmias and Cebes, has been already given, said 
<A NAME="871"></A>Socrates, if you put the two arguments together-I mean this and the former 
<A NAME="872"></A>one, in which we admitted that everything living is born of the dead. For 
<A NAME="873"></A>if the soul existed before birth, and in coming to life and being born 
<A NAME="874"></A>can be born only from death and dying, must she not after death continue 
<A NAME="875"></A>to exist, since she has to be born again? surely the proof which you desire 
<A NAME="876"></A>has been already furnished. Still I suspect that you and Simmias would 
<A NAME="877"></A>be glad to probe the argument further; like children, you are haunted with 
<A NAME="878"></A>a fear that when the soul leaves the body, the wind may really blow her 
<A NAME="879"></A>away and scatter her; especially if a man should happen to die in stormy 
<A NAME="880"></A>weather and not when the sky is calm.
<A NAME="881"></A><BR><BR>Cebes answered with a smile: Then, Socrates, you must argue us 
<A NAME="882"></A>out of our fears-and yet, strictly speaking, they are not our fears, but 
<A NAME="883"></A>there is a child within us to whom death is a sort of hobgoblin; him too 
<A NAME="884"></A>we must persuade not to be afraid when he is alone with him in the 
<A NAME="885"></A>dark.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR><BR>Socrates said: Let the voice of the charmer be applied daily until 
<A NAME="887"></A>you have charmed him away.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR><BR>And where shall we find a good charmer of our fears, Socrates, 
<A NAME="889"></A>when you are gone?
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR>Hellas, he replied, is a large place, Cebes, and has many good 
<A NAME="891"></A>men, and there are barbarous races not a few: seek for him among them all, 
<A NAME="892"></A>far and wide, sparing neither pains nor money; for there is no better way 
<A NAME="893"></A>of using your money. And you must not forget to seek for him among yourselves 
<A NAME="894"></A>too; for he is nowhere more likely to be found.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR>The search, replied Cebes, shall certainly be made. And now, if 
<A NAME="896"></A>you please, let us return to the point of the argument at which we 
<A NAME="897"></A>digressed.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR><BR>By all means, replied Socrates; what else should I 
<A NAME="899"></A>please?
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>Very good, he said.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>Must we not, said Socrates, ask ourselves some question of this sort?-What 
<A NAME="902"></A>is that which, as we imagine, is liable to be scattered away, and about 
<A NAME="903"></A>which we fear? and what again is that about which we have no fear? And 
<A NAME="904"></A>then we may proceed to inquire whether that which suffers dispersion is 
<A NAME="905"></A>or is not of the nature of soul-our hopes and fears as to our own souls 
<A NAME="906"></A>will turn upon that.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR><BR>That is true, he said.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>Now the compound or composite may be supposed to be naturally capable 
<A NAME="909"></A>of being dissolved in like manner as of being compounded; but that which 
<A NAME="910"></A>is uncompounded, and that only, must be, if anything is, 
<A NAME="911"></A>indissoluble.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR>Yes; that is what I should imagine, said Cebes.
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>And the uncompounded may be assumed to be the same and unchanging, 
<A NAME="914"></A>where the compound is always changing and never the 
<A NAME="915"></A>same?
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR>That I also think, he said.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>Then now let us return to the previous discussion. Is that idea or 
<A NAME="918"></A>essence, which in the dialectical process we define as essence of true 
<A NAME="919"></A>existence-whether essence of equality, beauty, or anything else: are these 
<A NAME="920"></A>essences, I say, liable at times to some degree of change? or are they 
<A NAME="921"></A>each of them always what they are, having the same simple, self-existent 
<A NAME="922"></A>and unchanging forms, and not admitting of variation at all, or in any 
<A NAME="923"></A>way, or at any time?
<A NAME="924"></A><BR><BR>They must be always the same, Socrates, replied 
<A NAME="925"></A>Cebes.
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>And what would you say of the many beautiful-whether men or horses 
<A NAME="927"></A>or garments or any other things which may be called equal or beautiful-are 
<A NAME="928"></A>they all unchanging and the same always, or quite the reverse? May they 
<A NAME="929"></A>not rather be described as almost always changing and hardly ever the same 
<A NAME="930"></A>either with themselves or with one another?
<A NAME="931"></A><BR><BR>The latter, replied Cebes; they are always in a state of 
<A NAME="932"></A>change.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>And these you can touch and see and perceive with the senses, but the 
<A NAME="934"></A>unchanging things you can only perceive with the mind-they are invisible 
<A NAME="935"></A>and are not seen?
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR>That is very true, he said.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>Well, then, he added, let us suppose that there are two sorts of existences, 
<A NAME="938"></A>one seen, the other unseen.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR><BR>Let us suppose them.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>The seen is the changing, and the unseen is the 
<A NAME="941"></A>unchanging.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>That may be also supposed.
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>And, further, is not one part of us body, and the rest of us 
<A NAME="944"></A>soul?
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>To be sure.
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>And to which class may we say that the body is more alike and 
<A NAME="947"></A>akin?
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>Clearly to the seen: no one can doubt that.
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>And is the soul seen or not seen?
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>Not by man, Socrates.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>And by "seen" and "not seen" is meant by us that which is or is not 
<A NAME="952"></A>visible to the eye of man?
<A NAME="953"></A><BR><BR>Yes, to the eye of man.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>And what do we say of the soul? is that seen or not 
<A NAME="955"></A>seen?
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>Not seen.
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>Unseen then?
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>Then the soul is more like to the unseen, and the body to the 
<A NAME="960"></A>seen?
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>That is most certain, Socrates.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>And were we not saying long ago that the soul when using the body as 
<A NAME="963"></A>an instrument of perception, that is to say, when using the sense of sight 
<A NAME="964"></A>or hearing or some other sense (for the meaning of perceiving through the 
<A NAME="965"></A>body is perceiving through the senses)-were we not saying that the soul 
<A NAME="966"></A>too is then dragged by the body into the region of the changeable, and 
<A NAME="967"></A>wanders and is confused; the world spins round her, and she is like a drunkard 
<A NAME="968"></A>when under their influence?
<A NAME="969"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>But when returning into herself she reflects; then she passes into 
<A NAME="971"></A>the realm of purity, and eternity, and immortality, and unchangeableness, 
<A NAME="972"></A>which are her kindred, and with them she ever lives, when she is by herself 
<A NAME="973"></A>and is not let or hindered; then she ceases from her erring ways, and being 
<A NAME="974"></A>in communion with the unchanging is unchanging. And this state of the soul 
<A NAME="975"></A>is called wisdom?
<A NAME="976"></A><BR><BR>That is well and truly said, Socrates, he replied.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>And to which class is the soul more nearly alike and akin, as far as 
<A NAME="978"></A>may be inferred from this argument, as well as from the preceding 
<A NAME="979"></A>one?
<A NAME="980"></A><BR><BR>I think, Socrates, that, in the opinion of everyone who follows 
<A NAME="981"></A>the argument, the soul will be infinitely more like the unchangeable even 
<A NAME="982"></A>the most stupid person will not deny that.
<A NAME="983"></A><BR><BR>And the body is more like the changing?
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>Yet once more consider the matter in this light: When the soul and 
<A NAME="986"></A>the body are united, then nature orders the soul to rule and govern, and 
<A NAME="987"></A>the body to obey and serve.
<A NAME="988"></A><BR><BR>Now which of these two functions is akin to the divine? and which 
<A NAME="989"></A>to the mortal? Does not the divine appear to you to be that which naturally 
<A NAME="990"></A>orders and rules, and the mortal that which is subject and 
<A NAME="991"></A>servant?
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>And which does the soul resemble?
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>The soul resembles the divine and the body the mortal-there can be 
<A NAME="995"></A>no doubt of that, Socrates.
<A NAME="996"></A><BR><BR>Then reflect, Cebes: is not the conclusion of the whole matter 
<A NAME="997"></A>this?-that the soul is in the very likeness of the divine, and immortal, 
<A NAME="998"></A>and intelligible, and uniform, and indissoluble, and unchangeable; and 
<A NAME="999"></A>the body is in the very likeness of the human, and mortal, and unintelligible, 
<A NAME="1000"></A>and multiform, and dissoluble, and changeable. Can this, my dear Cebes, 
<A NAME="1001"></A>be denied?
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR><BR>No, indeed.
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>But if this is true, then is not the body liable to speedy 
<A NAME="1004"></A>dissolution?
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR><BR>and is not the soul almost or altogether indissoluble?
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>And do you further observe, that after a man is dead, the body, which 
<A NAME="1008"></A>is the visible part of man, and has a visible framework, which is called 
<A NAME="1009"></A>a corpse, and which would naturally be dissolved and decomposed and dissipated, 
<A NAME="1010"></A>is not dissolved or decomposed at once, but may remain for a good while, 
<A NAME="1011"></A>if the constitution be sound at the time of death, and the season of the 
<A NAME="1012"></A>year favorable? For the body when shrunk and embalmed, as is the custom 
<A NAME="1013"></A>in Egypt, may remain almost entire through infinite ages; and even in decay, 
<A NAME="1014"></A>still there are some portions, such as the bones and ligaments, which are 
<A NAME="1015"></A>practically indestructible. You allow that?
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>And are we to suppose that the soul, which is invisible, in passing 
<A NAME="1018"></A>to the true Hades, which like her is invisible, and pure, and noble, and 
<A NAME="1019"></A>on her way to the good and wise God, whither, if God will, my soul is also 
<A NAME="1020"></A>soon to go-that the soul, I repeat, if this be her nature and origin, is 
<A NAME="1021"></A>blown away and perishes immediately on quitting the body as the many say? 
<A NAME="1022"></A>That can never be, dear Simmias and Cebes. The truth rather is that the 
<A NAME="1023"></A>soul which is pure at departing draws after her no bodily taint, having 
<A NAME="1024"></A>never voluntarily had connection with the body, which she is ever avoiding, 
<A NAME="1025"></A>herself gathered into herself (for such abstraction has been the study 
<A NAME="1026"></A>of her life). And what does this mean but that she has been a true disciple 
<A NAME="1027"></A>of philosophy and has practised how to die easily? And is not philosophy 
<A NAME="1028"></A>the practice of death?
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>That soul, I say, herself invisible, departs to the invisible worldto 
<A NAME="1031"></A>the divine and immortal and rational: thither arriving, she lives in bliss 
<A NAME="1032"></A>and is released from the error and folly of men, their fears and wild passions 
<A NAME="1033"></A>and all other human ills, and forever dwells, as they say of the initiated, 
<A NAME="1034"></A>in company with the gods. Is not this true, Cebes?
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR><BR>Yes, said Cebes, beyond a doubt.
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>But the soul which has been polluted, and is impure at the time of 
<A NAME="1037"></A>her departure, and is the companion and servant of the body always, and 
<A NAME="1038"></A>is in love with and fascinated by the body and by the desires and pleasures 
<A NAME="1039"></A>of the body, until she is led to believe that the truth only exists in 
<A NAME="1040"></A>a bodily form, which a man may touch and see and taste and use for the 
<A NAME="1041"></A>purposes of his lusts-the soul, I mean, accustomed to hate and fear and 
<A NAME="1042"></A>avoid the intellectual principle, which to the bodily eye is dark and invisible, 
<A NAME="1043"></A>and can be attained only by philosophy-do you suppose that such a soul 
<A NAME="1044"></A>as this will depart pure and unalloyed?
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR><BR>That is impossible, he replied.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>She is engrossed by the corporeal, which the continual association 
<A NAME="1047"></A>and constant care of the body have made natural to her.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>And this, my friend, may be conceived to be that heavy, weighty, earthy 
<A NAME="1050"></A>element of sight by which such a soul is depressed and dragged down again 
<A NAME="1051"></A>into the visible world, because she is afraid of the invisible and of the 
<A NAME="1052"></A>world below-prowling about tombs and sepulchres, in the neighborhood of 
<A NAME="1053"></A>which, as they tell us, are seen certain ghostly apparitions of souls which 
<A NAME="1054"></A>have not departed pure, but are cloyed with sight and therefore 
<A NAME="1055"></A>visible.
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR><BR>That is very likely, Socrates.
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>Yes, that is very likely, Cebes; and these must be the souls, not of 
<A NAME="1058"></A>the good, but of the evil, who are compelled to wander about such places 
<A NAME="1059"></A>in payment of the penalty of their former evil way of life; and they continue 
<A NAME="1060"></A>to wander until the desire which haunts them is satisfied and they are 
<A NAME="1061"></A>imprisoned in another body. And they may be supposed to be fixed in the 
<A NAME="1062"></A>same natures which they had in their former life.
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR><BR>What natures do you mean, Socrates?
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>I mean to say that men who have followed after gluttony, and wantonness, 
<A NAME="1065"></A>and drunkenness, and have had no thought of avoiding them, would pass into 
<A NAME="1066"></A>asses and animals of that sort. What do you think?
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR><BR>I think that exceedingly probable.
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>And those who have chosen the portion of injustice, and tyranny, and 
<A NAME="1069"></A>violence, will pass into wolves, or into hawks and kites; whither else 
<A NAME="1070"></A>can we suppose them to go?
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR><BR>Yes, said Cebes; that is doubtless the place of natures such as 
<A NAME="1072"></A>theirs. And there is no difficulty, he said, in assigning to all of them 
<A NAME="1073"></A>places answering to their several natures and propensities?
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR><BR>There is not, he said.
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>Even among them some are happier than others; and the happiest both 
<A NAME="1076"></A>in themselves and their place of abode are those who have practised the 
<A NAME="1077"></A>civil and social virtues which are called temperance and justice, and are 
<A NAME="1078"></A>acquired by habit and attention without philosophy and 
<A NAME="1079"></A>mind.
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR><BR>Why are they the happiest?
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>Because they may be expected to pass into some gentle, social nature 
<A NAME="1082"></A>which is like their own, such as that of bees or ants, or even back again 
<A NAME="1083"></A>into the form of man, and just and moderate men spring from 
<A NAME="1084"></A>them.
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR><BR>That is not impossible.
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>But he who is a philosopher or lover of learning, and is entirely pure 
<A NAME="1087"></A>at departing, is alone permitted to reach the gods. And this is the reason, 
<A NAME="1088"></A>Simmias and Cebes, why the true votaries of philosophy abstain from all 
<A NAME="1089"></A>fleshly lusts, and endure and refuse to give themselves up to them-not 
<A NAME="1090"></A>because they fear poverty or the ruin of their families, like the lovers 
<A NAME="1091"></A>of money, and the world in general; nor like the lovers of power and honor, 
<A NAME="1092"></A>because they dread the dishonor or disgrace of evil 
<A NAME="1093"></A>deeds.
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR><BR>No, Socrates, that would not become them, said 
<A NAME="1095"></A>Cebes.
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>No, indeed, he replied; and therefore they who have a care of their 
<A NAME="1097"></A>souls, and do not merely live in the fashions of the body, say farewell 
<A NAME="1098"></A>to all this; they will not walk in the ways of the blind: and when philosophy 
<A NAME="1099"></A>offers them purification and release from evil, they feel that they ought 
<A NAME="1100"></A>not to resist her influence, and to her they incline, and whither she leads 
<A NAME="1101"></A>they follow her.
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean, Socrates?
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>I will tell you, he said. The lovers of knowledge are conscious that 
<A NAME="1104"></A>their souls, when philosophy receives them, are simply fastened and glued 
<A NAME="1105"></A>to their bodies: the soul is only able to view existence through the bars 
<A NAME="1106"></A>of a prison, and not in her own nature; she is wallowing in the mire of 
<A NAME="1107"></A>all ignorance; and philosophy, seeing the terrible nature of her confinement, 
<A NAME="1108"></A>and that the captive through desire is led to conspire in her own captivity 
<A NAME="1109"></A>(for the lovers of knowledge are aware that this was the original state 
<A NAME="1110"></A>of the soul, and that when she was in this state philosophy received and 
<A NAME="1111"></A>gently counseled her, and wanted to release her, pointing out to her that 
<A NAME="1112"></A>the eye is full of deceit, and also the ear and other senses, and persuading 
<A NAME="1113"></A>her to retire from them in all but the necessary use of them and to be 
<A NAME="1114"></A>gathered up and collected into herself, and to trust only to herself and 
<A NAME="1115"></A>her own intuitions of absolute existence, and mistrust that which comes 
<A NAME="1116"></A>to her through others and is subject to vicissitude)-philosophy shows her 
<A NAME="1117"></A>that this is visible and tangible, but that what she sees in her own nature 
<A NAME="1118"></A>is intellectual and invisible. And the soul of the true philosopher thinks 
<A NAME="1119"></A>that she ought not to resist this deliverance, and therefore abstains from 
<A NAME="1120"></A>pleasures and desires and pains and fears, as far as she is able; reflecting 
<A NAME="1121"></A>that when a man has great joys or sorrows or fears or desires he suffers 
<A NAME="1122"></A>from them, not the sort of evil which might be anticipated-as, for example, 
<A NAME="1123"></A>the loss of his health or property, which he has sacrificed to his lusts-but 
<A NAME="1124"></A>he has suffered an evil greater far, which is the greatest and worst of 
<A NAME="1125"></A>all evils, and one of which he never thinks.
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR><BR>And what is that, Socrates? said Cebes.
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>Why, this: When the feeling of pleasure or pain in the soul is most 
<A NAME="1128"></A>intense, all of us naturally suppose that the object of this intense feeling 
<A NAME="1129"></A>is then plainest and truest: but this is not the case.
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>And this is the state in which the soul is most enthralled by the 
<A NAME="1132"></A>body.
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR><BR>How is that?
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>Why, because each pleasure and pain is a sort of nail which nails and 
<A NAME="1135"></A>rivets the soul to the body, and engrosses her and makes her believe that 
<A NAME="1136"></A>to be true which the body affirms to be true; and from agreeing with the 
<A NAME="1137"></A>body and having the same delights she is obliged to have the same habits 
<A NAME="1138"></A>and ways, and is not likely ever to be pure at her departure to the world 
<A NAME="1139"></A>below, but is always saturated with the body; so that she soon sinks into 
<A NAME="1140"></A>another body and there germinates and grows, and has therefore no part 
<A NAME="1141"></A>in the communion of the divine and pure and simple.
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR><BR>That is most true, Socrates, answered Cebes.
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>And this, Cebes, is the reason why the true lovers of knowledge are 
<A NAME="1144"></A>temperate and brave; and not for the reason which the world 
<A NAME="1145"></A>gives.
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>Certainly not! For not in that way does the soul of a philosopher reason; 
<A NAME="1148"></A>she will not ask philosophy to release her in order that when released 
<A NAME="1149"></A>she may deliver herself up again to the thraldom of pleasures and pains, 
<A NAME="1150"></A>doing a work only to be undone again, weaving instead of unweaving her 
<A NAME="1151"></A>Penelope's web. But she will make herself a calm of passion and follow 
<A NAME="1152"></A>Reason, and dwell in her, beholding the true and divine (which is not matter 
<A NAME="1153"></A>of opinion), and thence derive nourishment. Thus she seeks to live while 
<A NAME="1154"></A>she lives, and after death she hopes to go to her own kindred and to be 
<A NAME="1155"></A>freed from human ills. Never fear, Simmias and Cebes, that a soul which 
<A NAME="1156"></A>has been thus nurtured and has had these pursuits, will at her departure 
<A NAME="1157"></A>from the body be scattered and blown away by the winds and be nowhere and 
<A NAME="1158"></A>nothing.
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR><BR>When Socrates had done speaking, for a considerable time there 
<A NAME="1160"></A>was silence; he himself and most of us appeared to be meditating on what 
<A NAME="1161"></A>had been said; only Cebes and Simmias spoke a few words to one another. 
<A NAME="1162"></A>And Socrates observing this asked them what they thought of the argument, 
<A NAME="1163"></A>and whether there was anything wanting? For, said he, much is still open 
<A NAME="1164"></A>to suspicion and attack, if anyone were disposed to sift the matter thoroughly. 
<A NAME="1165"></A>If you are talking of something else I would rather not interrupt you, 
<A NAME="1166"></A>but if you are still doubtful about the argument do not hesitate to say 
<A NAME="1167"></A>exactly what you think, and let us have anything better which you can suggest; 
<A NAME="1168"></A>and if I am likely to be of any use, allow me to help 
<A NAME="1169"></A>you.
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR><BR>Simmias said: I must confess, Socrates, that doubts did arise in 
<A NAME="1171"></A>our minds, and each of us was urging and inciting the other to put the 
<A NAME="1172"></A>question which he wanted to have answered and which neither of us liked 
<A NAME="1173"></A>to ask, fearing that our importunity might be troublesome under present 
<A NAME="1174"></A>circumstances.
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR><BR>Socrates smiled and said: O Simmias, how strange that is; I am 
<A NAME="1176"></A>not very likely to persuade other men that I do not regard my present situation 
<A NAME="1177"></A>as a misfortune, if I am unable to persuade you, and you will keep fancying 
<A NAME="1178"></A>that I am at all more troubled now than at any other time. Will you not 
<A NAME="1179"></A>allow that I have as much of the spirit of prophecy in me as the swans? 
<A NAME="1180"></A>For they, when they perceive that they must die, having sung all their 
<A NAME="1181"></A>life long, do then sing more than ever, rejoicing in the thought that they 
<A NAME="1182"></A>are about to go away to the god whose ministers they are. But men, because 
<A NAME="1183"></A>they are themselves afraid of death, slanderously affirm of the swans that 
<A NAME="1184"></A>they sing a lament at the last, not considering that no bird sings when 
<A NAME="1185"></A>cold, or hungry, or in pain, not even the nightingale, nor the swallow, 
<A NAME="1186"></A>nor yet the hoopoe; which are said indeed to tune a lay of sorrow, although 
<A NAME="1187"></A>I do not believe this to be true of them any more than of the swans. But 
<A NAME="1188"></A>because they are sacred to Apollo and have the gift of prophecy and anticipate 
<A NAME="1189"></A>the good things of another world, therefore they sing and rejoice in that 
<A NAME="1190"></A>day more than they ever did before. And I, too, believing myself to be 
<A NAME="1191"></A>the consecrated servant of the same God, and the fellow servant of the 
<A NAME="1192"></A>swans, and thinking that I have received from my master gifts of prophecy 
<A NAME="1193"></A>which are not inferior to theirs, would not go out of life less merrily 
<A NAME="1194"></A>than the swans. Cease to mind then about this, but speak and ask anything 
<A NAME="1195"></A>which you like, while the eleven magistrates of Athens 
<A NAME="1196"></A>allow.
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR><BR>Well, Socrates, said Simmias, then I will tell you my difficulty, 
<A NAME="1198"></A>and Cebes will tell you his. For I dare say that you, Socrates, feel, as 
<A NAME="1199"></A>I do, how very hard or almost impossible is the attainment of any certainty 
<A NAME="1200"></A>about questions such as these in the present life. And yet I should deem 
<A NAME="1201"></A>him a coward who did not prove what is said about them to the uttermost, 
<A NAME="1202"></A>or whose heart failed him before he had examined them on every side. For 
<A NAME="1203"></A>he should persevere until he has attained one of two things: either he 
<A NAME="1204"></A>should discover or learn the truth about them; or, if this is impossible, 
<A NAME="1205"></A>I would have him take the best and most irrefragable of human notions, 
<A NAME="1206"></A>and let this be the raft upon which he sails through life-not without risk, 
<A NAME="1207"></A>as I admit, if he cannot find some word of God which will more surely and 
<A NAME="1208"></A>safely carry him. And now, as you bid me, I will venture to question you, 
<A NAME="1209"></A>as I should not like to reproach myself hereafter with not having said 
<A NAME="1210"></A>at the time what I think. For when I consider the matter either alone or 
<A NAME="1211"></A>with Cebes, the argument does certainly appear to me, Socrates, to be not 
<A NAME="1212"></A>sufficient.
<A NAME="1213"></A><BR><BR>Socrates answered: I dare say, my friend, that you may be right, 
<A NAME="1214"></A>but I should like to know in what respect the argument is not 
<A NAME="1215"></A>sufficient.
<A NAME="1216"></A><BR><BR>In this respect, replied Simmias: Might not a person use the same 
<A NAME="1217"></A>argument about harmony and the lyre-might he not say that harmony is a 
<A NAME="1218"></A>thing invisible, incorporeal, fair, divine, abiding in the lyre which is 
<A NAME="1219"></A>harmonized, but that the lyre and the strings are matter and material, 
<A NAME="1220"></A>composite, earthy, and akin to mortality? And when someone breaks the lyre, 
<A NAME="1221"></A>or cuts and rends the strings, then he who takes this view would argue 
<A NAME="1222"></A>as you do, and on the same analogy, that the harmony survives and has not 
<A NAME="1223"></A>perished; for you cannot imagine, as we would say, that the lyre without 
<A NAME="1224"></A>the strings, and the broken strings themselves, remain, and yet that the 
<A NAME="1225"></A>harmony, which is of heavenly and immortal nature and kindred, has perished-and 
<A NAME="1226"></A>perished too before the mortal. The harmony, he would say, certainly exists 
<A NAME="1227"></A>somewhere, and the wood and strings will decay before that decays. For 
<A NAME="1228"></A>I suspect, Socrates, that the notion of the soul which we are all of us 
<A NAME="1229"></A>inclined to entertain, would also be yours, and that you too would conceive 
<A NAME="1230"></A>the body to be strung up, and held together, by the elements of hot and 
<A NAME="1231"></A>cold, wet and dry, and the like, and that the soul is the harmony or due 
<A NAME="1232"></A>proportionate admixture of them. And, if this is true, the inference clearly 
<A NAME="1233"></A>is that when the strings of the body are unduly loosened or overstrained 
<A NAME="1234"></A>through disorder or other injury, then the soul, though most divine, like 
<A NAME="1235"></A>other harmonies of music or of the works of art, of course perishes at 
<A NAME="1236"></A>once, although the material remains of the body may last for a considerable 
<A NAME="1237"></A>time, until they are either decayed or burnt. Now if anyone maintained 
<A NAME="1238"></A>that the soul, being the harmony of the elements of the body, first perishes 
<A NAME="1239"></A>in that which is called death, how shall we answer him?
<A NAME="1240"></A><BR><BR>Socrates looked round at us as his manner was, and said, with a 
<A NAME="1241"></A>smile: Simmias has reason on his side; and why does not some one of you 
<A NAME="1242"></A>who is abler than myself answer him? for there is force in his attack upon 
<A NAME="1243"></A>me. But perhaps, before we answer him, we had better also hear what Cebes 
<A NAME="1244"></A>has to say against the argument-this will give us time for reflection, 
<A NAME="1245"></A>and when both of them have spoken, we may either assent to them if their 
<A NAME="1246"></A>words appear to be in consonance with the truth, or if not, we may take 
<A NAME="1247"></A>up the other side, and argue with them. Please to tell me then, Cebes, 
<A NAME="1248"></A>he said, what was the difficulty which troubled you?
<A NAME="1249"></A><BR><BR>Cebes said: I will tell you. My feeling is that the argument is 
<A NAME="1250"></A>still in the same position, and open to the same objections which were 
<A NAME="1251"></A>urged before; for I am ready to admit that the existence of the soul before 
<A NAME="1252"></A>entering into the bodily form has been very ingeniously, and, as I may 
<A NAME="1253"></A>be allowed to say, quite sufficiently proven; but the existence of the 
<A NAME="1254"></A>soul after death is still, in my judgment, unproven. Now my objection is 
<A NAME="1255"></A>not the same as that of Simmias; for I am not disposed to deny that the 
<A NAME="1256"></A>soul is stronger and more lasting than the body, being of opinion that 
<A NAME="1257"></A>in all such respects the soul very far excels the body. Well, then, says 
<A NAME="1258"></A>the argument to me, why do you remain unconvinced? When you see that the 
<A NAME="1259"></A>weaker is still in existence after the man is dead, will you not admit 
<A NAME="1260"></A>that the more lasting must also survive during the same period of time? 
<A NAME="1261"></A>Now I, like Simmias, must employ a figure; and I shall ask you to consider 
<A NAME="1262"></A>whether the figure is to the point. The parallel which I will suppose is 
<A NAME="1263"></A>that of an old weaver, who dies, and after his death somebo
