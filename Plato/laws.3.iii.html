<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Athenian Stranger. Enough of this. And what, then, is to be regarded as 
<A NAME="11"></A>the origin of government? Will not a man be able to judge of it best from 
<A NAME="12"></A>a point of view in which he may behold the progress of states and their 
<A NAME="13"></A>transitions to good or evil?
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR><B>Cleinias.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="15"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I mean that he might watch them from the point of view 
<A NAME="16"></A>of time, and observe the changes which take place in them during infinite 
<A NAME="17"></A>ages.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How so?
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Why, do you think that you can reckon the time which has 
<A NAME="20"></A>elapsed since cities first existed and men were citizens of 
<A NAME="21"></A>them?
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Hardly.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But are sure that it must be vast and 
<A NAME="24"></A>incalculable?
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And have not thousands and thousands of cities come into 
<A NAME="27"></A>being during this period and as many perished? And has not each of them 
<A NAME="28"></A>had every form of government many times over, now growing larger, now smaller, 
<A NAME="29"></A>and again improving or declining?
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us endeavour to ascertain the cause of these changes; 
<A NAME="32"></A>for that will probably explain the first origin and development of forms 
<A NAME="33"></A>of government.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very good. You shall endeavour to impart your thoughts 
<A NAME="35"></A>to us, and we will make an effort to understand you.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Do you believe that there is any truth in ancient 
<A NAME="37"></A>traditions?
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> What traditions?
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The traditions about the many destructions of mankind which 
<A NAME="40"></A>have been occasioned by deluges and pestilences, and in many other ways, 
<A NAME="41"></A>and of the survival of a remnant?
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Every one is disposed to believe 
<A NAME="43"></A>them.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us consider one of them, that which was caused by the 
<A NAME="45"></A>famous deluge.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What are we to observe about it?
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I mean to say that those who then escaped would only be 
<A NAME="48"></A>hill shepherds-small sparks of the human race preserved on the tops of 
<A NAME="49"></A>mountains.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Clearly.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Such survivors would necessarily be unacquainted with the 
<A NAME="52"></A>arts and the various devices which are suggested to the dwellers in cities 
<A NAME="53"></A>by interest or ambition, and with all the wrongs which they contrive against 
<A NAME="54"></A>one another.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us suppose, then, that the cities in the plain and 
<A NAME="57"></A>on the sea-coast were utterly destroyed at that time.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Would not all implements have then perished and every other 
<A NAME="60"></A>excellent invention of political or any other sort of wisdom have utterly 
<A NAME="61"></A>disappeared?
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Why, yes, my friend; and if things had always continued 
<A NAME="63"></A>as they are at present ordered, how could any discovery have ever been 
<A NAME="64"></A>made even in the least particular? For it is evident that the arts were 
<A NAME="65"></A>unknown during ten thousand times ten thousand years. And no more than 
<A NAME="66"></A>a thousand or two thousand years have elapsed since the discoveries of 
<A NAME="67"></A>Daedalus, Orpheus and Palamedes-since Marsyas and Olympus invented music, 
<A NAME="68"></A>and Amphion the lyre-not to speak of numberless other inventions which 
<A NAME="69"></A>are but of yesterday.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Have you forgotten, Cleinias, the name of a friend 
<A NAME="71"></A>who is really of yesterday?
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I suppose that you mean Epimenides.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The same, my friend; he does indeed far overleap the heads 
<A NAME="74"></A>of all mankind by his invention; for he carried out in practice, as you 
<A NAME="75"></A>declare, what of old Hesiod only preached.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes, according to our tradition.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> After the great destruction, may we not suppose that the 
<A NAME="78"></A>state of man was something of this sort:-In the beginning of things there 
<A NAME="79"></A>was a fearful illimitable desert and a vast expanse of land; a herd or 
<A NAME="80"></A>two of oxen would be the only survivors of the animal world; and there 
<A NAME="81"></A>might be a few goats, these too hardly enough to maintain the shepherds 
<A NAME="82"></A>who tended them?
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And of cities or governments or legislation, about which 
<A NAME="85"></A>we are now talking, do you suppose that they could have any recollection 
<A NAME="86"></A>at all?
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> None whatever.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And out of this state of things has there not sprung all 
<A NAME="89"></A>that we now are and have: cities and governments, and arts and laws, and 
<A NAME="90"></A>a great deal of vice and a great deal of virtue?
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Why, my good friend, how can we possibly suppose that those 
<A NAME="93"></A>who knew nothing of all the good and evil of cities could have attained 
<A NAME="94"></A>their full development, whether of virtue or of vice?
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I understand your meaning, and you are quite 
<A NAME="96"></A>right.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But, as time advanced and the race multiplied, the world 
<A NAME="98"></A>came to be what the world is.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Doubtless the change was not made all in a moment, but 
<A NAME="101"></A>little by little, during a very long period of time.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> A highly probable supposition.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> At first, they would have a natural fear ringing in their 
<A NAME="104"></A>ears which would prevent their descending from the heights into the 
<A NAME="105"></A>plain.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The fewness of the survivors at that time would have made 
<A NAME="108"></A>them all the more desirous of seeing one another; but then the means of 
<A NAME="109"></A>travelling either by land or sea had been almost entirely lost, as I may 
<A NAME="110"></A>say, with the loss of the arts, and there was great difficulty in getting 
<A NAME="111"></A>at one another; for iron and brass and all metals were jumbled together 
<A NAME="112"></A>and had disappeared in the chaos; nor was there any possibility of extracting 
<A NAME="113"></A>ore from them; and they had scarcely any means of felling timber. Even 
<A NAME="114"></A>if you suppose that some implements might have been preserved in the mountains, 
<A NAME="115"></A>they must quickly have worn out and vanished, and there would be no more 
<A NAME="116"></A>of them until the art of metallurgy had again revived.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> There could not have been.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In how many generations would this be 
<A NAME="119"></A>attained?
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Clearly, not for many generations.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> During this period, and for some time afterwards, all the 
<A NAME="122"></A>arts which require iron and brass and the like would 
<A NAME="123"></A>disappear.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Faction and war would also have died out in those days, 
<A NAME="126"></A>and for many reasons.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How would that be?
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In the first place, the desolation of these primitive men 
<A NAME="129"></A>would create in them a feeling of affection and good-will towards one another; 
<A NAME="130"></A>and, secondly, they would have no occasion to quarrel about their subsistence, 
<A NAME="131"></A>for they would have pasture in abundance, except just at first, and in 
<A NAME="132"></A>some particular cases; and from their pasture-land they would obtain the 
<A NAME="133"></A>greater part of their food in a primitive age, having plenty of milk and 
<A NAME="134"></A>flesh; moreover they would procure other food by the chase, not to be despised 
<A NAME="135"></A>either in quantity or quality. They would also have abundance of clothing, 
<A NAME="136"></A>and bedding, and dwellings, and utensils either capable of standing on 
<A NAME="137"></A>the fire or not; for the plastic and weaving arts do not require any use 
<A NAME="138"></A>of iron: and God has given these two arts to man in order to provide him 
<A NAME="139"></A>with all such things, that, when reduced to the last extremity, the human 
<A NAME="140"></A>race may still grow and increase. Hence in those days mankind were not 
<A NAME="141"></A>very poor; nor was poverty a cause of difference among them; and rich they 
<A NAME="142"></A>could not have been, having neither gold nor silver:-such at that time 
<A NAME="143"></A>was their condition. And the community which has neither poverty nor riches 
<A NAME="144"></A>will always have the noblest principles; in it there is no insolence or 
<A NAME="145"></A>injustice, nor, again, are there any contentions or envyings. And therefore 
<A NAME="146"></A>they were good, and also because they were what is called simple-minded; 
<A NAME="147"></A>and when they were told about good and evil, they in their simplicity believed 
<A NAME="148"></A>what they heard to be very truth and practised it. No one had the wit to 
<A NAME="149"></A>suspect another of a falsehood, as men do now; but what they heard about 
<A NAME="150"></A>Gods and men they believed to be true, and lived accordingly; and therefore 
<A NAME="151"></A>they were in all respects such as we have described 
<A NAME="152"></A>them.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That quite accords with my views, and with those of 
<A NAME="154"></A>my friend here.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Would not many generations living on in a simple manner, 
<A NAME="156"></A>although ruder, perhaps, and more ignorant of the arts generally, and in 
<A NAME="157"></A>particular of those of land or naval warfare, and likewise of other arts, 
<A NAME="158"></A>termed in cities legal practices and party conflicts, and including all 
<A NAME="159"></A>conceivable ways of hurting one another in word and deed;-although inferior 
<A NAME="160"></A>to those who lived before the deluge, or to the men of our day in these 
<A NAME="161"></A>respects, would they not, I say, be simpler and more manly, and also more 
<A NAME="162"></A>temperate and altogether more just? The reason has been already 
<A NAME="163"></A>explained.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I should wish you to understand that what has preceded 
<A NAME="166"></A>and what is about to follow, has been, and will be said, with the intention 
<A NAME="167"></A>of explaining what need the men of that time had of laws, and who was their 
<A NAME="168"></A>lawgiver.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> And thus far what you have said has been very well 
<A NAME="170"></A>said.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> They could hardly have wanted lawgivers as yet; nothing 
<A NAME="172"></A>of that sort was likely to have existed in their days, for they had no 
<A NAME="173"></A>letters at this early period; they lived by habit and the customs of their 
<A NAME="174"></A>ancestors, as they are called.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Probably.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But there was already existing a form of government which, 
<A NAME="177"></A>if I am not mistaken, is generally termed a lordship, and this still remains 
<A NAME="178"></A>in many places, both among Hellenes and barbarians, and is the government 
<A NAME="179"></A>which is declared by Homer to have prevailed among the 
<A NAME="180"></A>Cyclopes:
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>They have neither councils nor judgments, but they dwell in hollow 
<A NAME="182"></A>caves on the tops of high mountains, and every one gives law to his wife 
<A NAME="183"></A>and children, and they do not busy themselves about one 
<A NAME="184"></A>another.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That seems to be a charming poet of yours; I have read 
<A NAME="186"></A>some other verses of his, which are very clever; but I do not know much 
<A NAME="187"></A>of him, for foreign poets are very little read among the 
<A NAME="188"></A>Cretans.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR><B>Megillus.</B> But they are in Lacedaemon, and he appears to 
<A NAME="190"></A>be the prince of them all; the manner of life, however, which he describes 
<A NAME="191"></A>is not Spartan, but rather Ionian, and he seems quite to confirm what you 
<A NAME="192"></A>are saying, when he traces up the ancient state of mankind by the help 
<A NAME="193"></A>of tradition to barbarism.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes, he does confirm it; and we may accept his witness 
<A NAME="195"></A>to the fact that such forms of government sometimes 
<A NAME="196"></A>arise.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> We may.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And were not such states composed of men who had been dispersed 
<A NAME="199"></A>in single habitations and families by the poverty which attended the devastations; 
<A NAME="200"></A>and did not the eldest then rule among them, because with them government 
<A NAME="201"></A>originated in the authority of a father and a mother, whom, like a flock 
<A NAME="202"></A>of birds, they followed, forming one troop under the patriarchal rule and 
<A NAME="203"></A>sovereignty of their parents, which of all sovereignties is the most 
<A NAME="204"></A>just?
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> After this they came together in greater numbers, and increased 
<A NAME="207"></A>the size of their cities, and betook themselves to husbandry, first of 
<A NAME="208"></A>all at the foot of the mountains, and made enclosures of loose walls and 
<A NAME="209"></A>works of defence, in order to keep off wild beasts; thus creating a single 
<A NAME="210"></A>large and common habitation.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes; at least we may suppose so.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> There is another thing which would probably 
<A NAME="213"></A>happen.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> What?
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> When these larger habitations grew up out of the lesser 
<A NAME="216"></A>original ones, each of the lesser ones would survive in the larger; every 
<A NAME="217"></A>family would be under the rule of the eldest, and, owing to their separation 
<A NAME="218"></A>from one another, would have peculiar customs in things divine and human, 
<A NAME="219"></A>which they would have received from their several parents who had educated 
<A NAME="220"></A>them; and these customs would incline them to order, when the parents had 
<A NAME="221"></A>the element of order in their nature, and to courage, when they had the 
<A NAME="222"></A>element of courage. And they would naturally stamp upon their children, 
<A NAME="223"></A>and upon their children's children, their own likings; and, as we are saying, 
<A NAME="224"></A>they would find their way into the larger society, having already their 
<A NAME="225"></A>own peculiar laws.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And every man surely likes his own laws best, and the laws 
<A NAME="228"></A>of others not so well.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then now we seem to have stumbled upon the beginnings of 
<A NAME="231"></A>legislation.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Exactly.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The next step will be that these persons who have met together, 
<A NAME="234"></A>will select some arbiters, who will review the laws of all of them, and 
<A NAME="235"></A>will publicly present such as they approve to the chiefs who lead the tribes, 
<A NAME="236"></A>and who are in a manner their kings, allowing them to choose those which 
<A NAME="237"></A>they think best. These persons will themselves be called legislators, and 
<A NAME="238"></A>will appoint the magistrates, framing some sort of aristocracy, or perhaps 
<A NAME="239"></A>monarchy, out of the dynasties or lordships, and in this altered state 
<A NAME="240"></A>of the government they will live.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes, that would be the natural order of 
<A NAME="242"></A>things.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then, now let us speak of a third form of government, in 
<A NAME="244"></A>which all other forms and conditions of polities and cities 
<A NAME="245"></A>concur.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What is that?
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The form which in fact Homer indicates as following the 
<A NAME="248"></A>second. This third form arose when, as he says, Dardanus founded 
<A NAME="249"></A>Dardania:
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>For not as yet had the holy Ilium been built on the plain to be 
<A NAME="251"></A>a city of speaking men; but they were still dwelling at the foot of many-fountained 
<A NAME="252"></A>Ida. For indeed, in these verses, and in what he said of the Cyclopes, 
<A NAME="253"></A>he speaks the words of God and nature; for poets are a divine race and 
<A NAME="254"></A>often in their strains, by the aid of the Muses and the Graces, they attain 
<A NAME="255"></A>truth.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then now let us proceed with the rest of our tale, which 
<A NAME="258"></A>will probably be found to illustrate in some degree our proposed design:-Shall 
<A NAME="259"></A>we do so?
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Ilium was built, when they descended from the mountain, 
<A NAME="262"></A>in a large and fair plain, on a sort of low hill, watered by many rivers 
<A NAME="263"></A>descending from Ida.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Such is the tradition.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And we must suppose this event to have taken place many 
<A NAME="266"></A>ages after the deluge?
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> A marvellous forgetfulness of the former destruction 
<A NAME="268"></A>would appear to have come over them, when they placed their town right 
<A NAME="269"></A>under numerous streams flowing from the heights, trusting for their security 
<A NAME="270"></A>to not very high hills, either.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> There must have been a long interval, 
<A NAME="272"></A>clearly.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And, as population increased, many other cities would begin 
<A NAME="274"></A>to be inhabited.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Doubtless.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Those cities made war against Troy-by sea as well as land-for 
<A NAME="277"></A>at that time men were ceasing to be afraid of the sea.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Clearly.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The Achaeans remained ten years, and overthrew 
<A NAME="280"></A>Troy.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And during the ten years in which the Achaeans were besieging 
<A NAME="283"></A>Ilium, the homes of the besiegers were falling into an evil plight. Their 
<A NAME="284"></A>youth revolted; and when the soldiers returned to their own cities and 
<A NAME="285"></A>families, they did not receive them properly, and as they ought to have 
<A NAME="286"></A>done, and numerous deaths, murders, exiles, were the consequence. The exiles 
<A NAME="287"></A>came again, under a new name, no longer Achaeans, but Dorians-a name which 
<A NAME="288"></A>they derived from Dorieus; for it was he who gathered them together. The 
<A NAME="289"></A>rest of the story is told by you Lacedaemonians as part of the history 
<A NAME="290"></A>of Sparta.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Thus, after digressing from the original subject of laws 
<A NAME="293"></A>into music and drinking-bouts, the argument has, providentially, come back 
<A NAME="294"></A>to the same point, and presents to us another handle. For we have reached 
<A NAME="295"></A>the settlement of Lacedaemon; which, as you truly say, is in laws and in 
<A NAME="296"></A>institutions the sister of Crete. And we are all the better for the digression, 
<A NAME="297"></A>because we have gone through various governments and settlements, and have 
<A NAME="298"></A>been present at the foundation of a first, second, and third state, succeeding 
<A NAME="299"></A>one another in infinite time. And now there appears on the horizon a fourth 
<A NAME="300"></A>state or nation which was once in process of settlement and has continued 
<A NAME="301"></A>settled to this day. If, out of all this, we are able to discern what is 
<A NAME="302"></A>well or ill settled, and what laws are the salvation and what are the destruction 
<A NAME="303"></A>of cities, and what changes would make a state happy, O Megillus and Cleinias, 
<A NAME="304"></A>we may now begin again, unless we have some fault to find with the previous 
<A NAME="305"></A>discussion.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> If some God, Stranger, would promise us that our new 
<A NAME="307"></A>enquiry about legislation would be as good and full as the present, I would 
<A NAME="308"></A>go a great way to hear such another, and would think that a day as long 
<A NAME="309"></A>as this-and we are now approaching the longest day of the year-was too 
<A NAME="310"></A>short for the discussion.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then I suppose that we must consider this 
<A NAME="312"></A>subject?
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><B>Meg.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us place ourselves in thought at the moment when Lacedaemon 
<A NAME="315"></A>and Argos and Messene and the rest of the Peloponnesus were all in complete 
<A NAME="316"></A>subjection, Megillus, to your ancestors; for afterwards, as the legend 
<A NAME="317"></A>informs us, they divided their army into three portions, and settled three 
<A NAME="318"></A>cities, Argos, Messene, Lacedaemon.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> True.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Temenus was the king of Argos, Cresphontes of Messene, 
<A NAME="321"></A>Procles and Eurysthenes of Lacedaemon.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> To these kings all the men of that day made oath that they 
<A NAME="324"></A>would assist them, if any one subverted their kingdom.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> True.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But can a kingship be destroyed, or was any other form 
<A NAME="327"></A>of government ever destroyed, by any but the rulers themselves? No indeed, 
<A NAME="328"></A>by Zeus. Have we already forgotten what was said a little while 
<A NAME="329"></A>ago?
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> No.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And may we not now further confirm what was then mentioned? 
<A NAME="332"></A>For we have come upon facts which have brought us back again to the same 
<A NAME="333"></A>principle; so that, in resuming the discussion, we shall not be enquiring 
<A NAME="334"></A>about an empty theory, but about events which actually happened. The case 
<A NAME="335"></A>was as follows:-Three royal heroes made oath to three cities which were 
<A NAME="336"></A>under a kingly government, and the cities to the kings, that both rulers 
<A NAME="337"></A>and subjects should govern and be governed according to the laws which 
<A NAME="338"></A>were common to all of them: the rulers promised that as time and the race 
<A NAME="339"></A>went forward they would not make their rule more arbitrary; and the subjects 
<A NAME="340"></A>said that, if the rulers observed these conditions, they would never subvert 
<A NAME="341"></A>or permit others to subvert those kingdoms; the kings were to assist kings 
<A NAME="342"></A>and peoples when injured, and the peoples were to assist peoples and kings 
<A NAME="343"></A>in like manner. Is not this the fact?
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And the three states to whom these laws were given, whether 
<A NAME="346"></A>their kings or any others were the authors of them, had therefore the greatest 
<A NAME="347"></A>security for the maintenance of their constitutions?
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> What security?
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> That the other two states were always to come to the rescue 
<A NAME="350"></A>against a rebellious third.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> True.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Many persons say that legislators ought to impose such 
<A NAME="353"></A>laws as the mass of the people will be ready to receive; but this is just 
<A NAME="354"></A>as if one were to command gymnastic masters or physicians to treat or cure 
<A NAME="355"></A>their pupils or patients in an agreeable manner.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Exactly.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Whereas the physician may often be too happy if he can 
<A NAME="358"></A>restore health, and make the body whole, without any very great infliction 
<A NAME="359"></A>of pain.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> There was also another advantage possessed by the men of 
<A NAME="362"></A>that day, which greatly lightened the task of passing 
<A NAME="363"></A>laws.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> What advantage?
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The legislators of that day, when they equalized property, 
<A NAME="366"></A>escaped the great accusation which generally arises in legislation, if 
<A NAME="367"></A>a person attempts to disturb the possession of land, or to abolish debts, 
<A NAME="368"></A>because he sees that without this reform there can never be any real equality. 
<A NAME="369"></A>Now, in general, when the legislator attempts to make a new settlement 
<A NAME="370"></A>of such matters, every one meets him with the cry, that "he is not to disturb 
<A NAME="371"></A>vested interests"-declaring with imprecations that he is introducing agrarian 
<A NAME="372"></A>laws and cancelling of debts, until a man is at his wits end; whereas no 
<A NAME="373"></A>one could quarrel with the Dorians for distributing the land-there was 
<A NAME="374"></A>nothing to hinder them; and as for debts, they had none which were considerable 
<A NAME="375"></A>or of old standing.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But then, my good friends, why did the settlement and legislation 
<A NAME="378"></A>of their country turn out so badly?
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> How do you mean; and why do you blame 
<A NAME="380"></A>them?
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> There were three kingdoms, and of these, two quickly corrupted 
<A NAME="382"></A>their original constitution and laws, and the only one which remained was 
<A NAME="383"></A>the Spartan.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> The question which you ask is not easily 
<A NAME="385"></A>answered.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And yet must be answered when we are enquiring about laws, 
<A NAME="387"></A>this being our old man's sober game of play, whereby we beguile the way, 
<A NAME="388"></A>as I was saying when we first set out on our journey.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Certainly; and we must find out why this 
<A NAME="390"></A>was.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> What laws are more worthy of our attention than those which 
<A NAME="392"></A>have regulated such cities? or what settlements of states are greater or 
<A NAME="393"></A>more famous?
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> I know of none.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Can we doubt that your ancestors intended these institutions 
<A NAME="396"></A>not only for the protection of Peloponnesus, but of all the Hellenes. in 
<A NAME="397"></A>case they were attacked by the barbarian? For the inhabitants of the region 
<A NAME="398"></A>about Ilium, when they provoked by their insolence the Trojan war, relied 
<A NAME="399"></A>upon the power of the Assyrians and the Empire of Ninus, which still existed 
<A NAME="400"></A>and had a great prestige; the people of those days fearing the united Assyrian 
<A NAME="401"></A>Empire just as we now fear the Great King. And the second capture of Troy 
<A NAME="402"></A>was a serious offence against them, because Troy was a portion of the Assyrian 
<A NAME="403"></A>Empire. To meet the danger the single army was distributed between three 
<A NAME="404"></A>cities by the royal brothers, sons of Heracles-a fair device, as it seemed, 
<A NAME="405"></A>and a far better arrangement than the expedition against Troy. For, firstly, 
<A NAME="406"></A>the people of that day had, as they thought, in the Heraclidae better leaders 
<A NAME="407"></A>than the Pelopidae; in the next place, they considered that their army 
<A NAME="408"></A>was superior in valour to that which went against Troy; for, although the 
<A NAME="409"></A>latter conquered the Trojans, they were themselves conquered by the Heraclidae-Achaeans 
<A NAME="410"></A>by Dorians. May we not suppose that this was the intention with which the 
<A NAME="411"></A>men of those days framed the constitutions of their 
<A NAME="412"></A>states?
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And would not men who had shared with one another many 
<A NAME="415"></A>dangers, and were governed by a single race of royal brothers, and had 
<A NAME="416"></A>taken the advice of oracles, and in particular of the Delphian Apollo, 
<A NAME="417"></A>be likely to think that such states would be firmly and lastingly 
<A NAME="418"></A>established?
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Of course they would.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yet these institutions, of which such great expectations 
<A NAME="421"></A>were entertained, seem to have all rapidly vanished away; with the exception, 
<A NAME="422"></A>as I was saying, of that small part of them which existed in yourland.And 
<A NAME="423"></A>this third part has never to this day ceased warring against the two others; 
<A NAME="424"></A>whereas, if the original idea had been carried out, and they had agreed 
<A NAME="425"></A>to be one, their power would have been invincible in 
<A NAME="426"></A>war.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> No doubt.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But what was the ruin of this glorious confederacy? Here 
<A NAME="429"></A>is a subject well worthy of consideration.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Certainly, no one will ever find more striking instances 
<A NAME="431"></A>of laws or governments being the salvation or destruction of great and 
<A NAME="432"></A>noble interests, than are here presented to his view.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then now we seem to have happily arrived at a real 
<A NAME="434"></A>and important question.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Did you never remark, sage friend, that all men, and we 
<A NAME="437"></A>ourselves at this moment, often fancy that they see some beautiful thing 
<A NAME="438"></A>which might have effected wonders if any one had only known how to make 
<A NAME="439"></A>a right use of it in some way; and yet this mode of looking at things may 
<A NAME="440"></A>turn out after all to be a mistake, and not according to nature, either 
<A NAME="441"></A>in our own case or in any other?
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> To what are you referring, and what do you 
<A NAME="443"></A>mean?
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I was thinking of my own admiration of the aforesaid Heracleid 
<A NAME="445"></A>expedition, which was so noble, and might have had such wonderful results 
<A NAME="446"></A>for the Hellenes, if only rightly used; and I was just laughing at 
<A NAME="447"></A>myself.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> But were you not right and wise in speaking as you 
<A NAME="449"></A>did, and we in assenting to you?
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Perhaps; and yet I cannot help observing that any one 
<A NAME="451"></A>who sees anything great or powerful, immediately has the feeling that-"If 
<A NAME="452"></A>the owner only knew how to use his great and noble possession, how happy 
<A NAME="453"></A>would he be, and what great results would he achieve!"
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> And would he not be justified?
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Reflect; in what point of view does this sort of praise 
<A NAME="456"></A>appear just: First, in reference to the question in hand:-If the then commanders 
<A NAME="457"></A>had known how to arrange their army properly, how would they have attained 
<A NAME="458"></A>success? Would not this have been the way? They would have bound them all 
<A NAME="459"></A>firmly together and preserved them for ever, giving them freedom and dominion 
<A NAME="460"></A>at pleasure, combined with the power of doing in the whole world, Hellenic 
<A NAME="461"></A>and barbarian, whatever they and their descendants desired. What other 
<A NAME="462"></A>aim would they have had?
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Suppose any one were in the same way to express his admiration 
<A NAME="465"></A>at the sight of great wealth or family honour, or the like, he would praise 
<A NAME="466"></A>them under the idea that through them he would attain either all or the 
<A NAME="467"></A>greater and chief part of what he desires.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> He would.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Well, now, and does not the argument show that there is 
<A NAME="470"></A>one common desire of all mankind?
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The desire which a man has, that all things, if possible-at 
<A NAME="473"></A>any rate, things human-may come to pass in accordance with his soul's 
<A NAME="474"></A>desire.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And having this desire always, and at every time of life, 
<A NAME="477"></A>in youth, in manhood, in age, he cannot help always praying for the fulfilment 
<A NAME="478"></A>of it.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> No doubt.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And we join in the prayers of our friends, and ask for 
<A NAME="481"></A>them what they ask for themselves.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> We do.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Dear is the son to the father-the younger to the 
<A NAME="484"></A>elder.
<A NAME="485"></A><BR><B>Meg.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And yet the son often prays to obtain things which the 
<A NAME="487"></A>father prays that he may not obtain.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> When the son is young and foolish, you 
<A NAME="489"></A>mean?
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes; or when the father, in the dotage of age or the heat 
<A NAME="491"></A>of youth, having no sense of right and justice, prays with fervour, under 
<A NAME="492"></A>the influence of feelings akin to those of Theseus when he cursed the unfortunate 
<A NAME="493"></A>Hippolytus, do you imagine that the son, having a sense of right and justice, 
<A NAME="494"></A>will join in his father's prayers?
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> I understand you to mean that a man should not desire 
<A NAME="496"></A>or be in a hurry to have all things according to his wish, for his wish 
<A NAME="497"></A>may be at variance with his reason. But every state and every individual 
<A NAME="498"></A>ought to pray and strive for wisdom.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes; and I remember, and you will remember, what I 
<A NAME="500"></A>said at first, that a statesman and legislator ought to ordain laws with 
<A NAME="501"></A>a view to wisdom; while you were arguing that the good lawgiver ought to 
<A NAME="502"></A>order all with a view to war. And to this I replied that there were four 
<A NAME="503"></A>virtues, but that upon your view one of them only was the aim of legislation; 
<A NAME="504"></A>whereas you ought to regard all virtue, and especially that which comes 
<A NAME="505"></A>first, and is the leader of all the rest-I mean wisdom and mind and opinion, 
<A NAME="506"></A>having affection and desire in their train. And now the argument returns 
<A NAME="507"></A>to the same point, and I say once more, in jest if you like, or in earnest 
<A NAME="508"></A>if you like, that the prayer of a fool is full of danger, being likely 
<A NAME="509"></A>to end in the opposite of what he desires. And if you would rather receive 
<A NAME="510"></A>my words in earnest, I am willing that you should; and you will find, I 
<A NAME="511"></A>suspect, as I have said already, that not cowardice was the cause of the 
<A NAME="512"></A>ruin of the Dorian kings and of their whole design, nor ignorance of military 
<A NAME="513"></A>matters, either on the part of the rulers or of their subjects; but their 
<A NAME="514"></A>misfortunes were due to their general degeneracy, and especially to their 
<A NAME="515"></A>ignorance of the most important human affairs. That was then, and is still, 
<A NAME="516"></A>and always will be the case, as I will endeavour, if you will allow me, 
<A NAME="517"></A>to make out and demonstrate as well as I am able to you who are my friends, 
<A NAME="518"></A>in the course of the argument.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Pray go on, Stranger;-compliments are troublesome, 
<A NAME="520"></A>but we will show, not in word but in deed, how greatly we prize your words, 
<A NAME="521"></A>for we will give them our best attention; and that is the way in which 
<A NAME="522"></A>a freeman best shows his approval or disapproval.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Excellent, Cleinias; let us do as you 
<A NAME="524"></A>say.
<A NAME="525"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> By all means, if Heaven wills. Go on.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Well, then, proceeding in the same train of thought, I 
<A NAME="527"></A>say that the greatest ignorance was the ruin of the Dorian power, and that 
<A NAME="528"></A>now, as then, ignorance is ruin. And if this be true, the legislator must 
<A NAME="529"></A>endeavour to implant wisdom in states, and banish ignorance to the utmost 
<A NAME="530"></A>of his power.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That is evident.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then now consider what is really the greatest ignorance. 
<A NAME="533"></A>I should like to know whether you and Megillus would agree with me in what 
<A NAME="534"></A>I am about to say; for my opinion is-
<A NAME="535"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What?
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> That the greatest ignorance is when a man hates that which 
<A NAME="537"></A>he nevertheless thinks to be good and noble, and loves and embraces that 
<A NAME="538"></A>which he knows to be unrighteous and evil. This disagreement between the 
<A NAME="539"></A>sense of pleasure and the judgment of reason in the soul is, in my opinion, 
<A NAME="540"></A>the worst ignorance; and also the greatest, because affecting the great 
<A NAME="541"></A>mass of the human soul; for the principle which feels pleasure and pain 
<A NAME="542"></A>in the individual is like the mass or populace in a state. And when the 
<A NAME="543"></A>soul is opposed to knowledge, or opinion, or reason, which are her natural 
<A NAME="544"></A>lords, that I call folly, just as in the state, when the multitude refuses 
<A NAME="545"></A>to obey their rulers and the laws; or, again, in the individual, when fair 
<A NAME="546"></A>reasonings have their habitation in the soul and yet do no good, but rather 
<A NAME="547"></A>the reverse of good. All these cases I term the worst ignorance, whether 
<A NAME="548"></A>in individuals or in states. You will understand, Stranger, that I am speaking 
<A NAME="549"></A>of something which is very different from the ignorance of 
<A NAME="550"></A>handicraftsmen.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes, my friend, we understand and 
<A NAME="552"></A>agree.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us, then, in the first place declare and affirm that 
<A NAME="554"></A>the citizen who does not know these things ought never to have any kind 
<A NAME="555"></A>of authority entrusted to him: he must be stigmatized as ignorant, even 
<A NAME="556"></A>though he be versed in calculation and skilled in all sorts of accomplishments, 
<A NAME="557"></A>and feats of mental dexterity; and the opposite are to be called wise, 
<A NAME="558"></A>even although, in the words of the proverb, they know neither how to read 
<A NAME="559"></A>nor how to swim; and to them, as to men of sense, authority is to be committed. 
<A NAME="560"></A>For, O my friends, how can there be the least shadow of wisdom when there 
<A NAME="561"></A>is no harmony? There is none; but the noblest and greatest of harmonies 
<A NAME="562"></A>may be truly said to be the greatest wisdom; and of this he is a partaker 
<A NAME="563"></A>who lives according to reason; whereas he who is devoid of reason is the 
<A NAME="564"></A>destroyer of his house and the very opposite of a saviour of the state: 
<A NAME="565"></A>he is utterly ignorant of political wisdom. Let this, then, as I was saying, 
<A NAME="566"></A>be laid down by us.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Let it be so laid down.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I suppose that there must be rulers and subjects in 
<A NAME="569"></A>states?
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And what are the principles on which men rule and obey 
<A NAME="572"></A>in cities, whether great or small; and similarly in families? What are 
<A NAME="573"></A>they, and how many in number? Is there not one claim of authority which 
<A NAME="574"></A>is always just-that of fathers and mothers and in general of progenitors 
<A NAME="575"></A>to rule over their offspring?
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> There is.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Next follows the principle that the noble should rule over 
<A NAME="578"></A>the ignoble; and, thirdly, that the elder should rule and the younger 
<A NAME="579"></A>obey?
<A NAME="580"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And, fourthly, that slaves should be ruled, and their masters 
<A NAME="582"></A>rule?
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Fifthly, if I am not mistaken, comes the principle that 
<A NAME="585"></A>the stronger shall rule, and the weaker be ruled?
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That is a rule not to be disobeyed.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes, and a rule which prevails very widely among all creatures, 
<A NAME="588"></A>and is according to nature, as the Theban poet Pindar once said; and the 
<A NAME="589"></A>sixth principle, and the greatest of all, is, that the wise should lead 
<A NAME="590"></A>and command, and the ignorant follow and obey; and yet, O thou most wise 
<A NAME="591"></A>Pindar, as I should reply him, this surely is not contrary to nature, but 
<A NAME="592"></A>according to nature, being the rule of law over willing subjects, and not 
<A NAME="593"></A>a rule of compulsion.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> There is a seventh kind of rule which is awarded by lot, 
<A NAME="596"></A>and is dear to the Gods and a token of good fortune: he on whom the lot 
<A NAME="597"></A>falls is a ruler, and he who fails in obtaining the lot goes away and is 
<A NAME="598"></A>the subject; and this we affirm to be quite just.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Ath. "Then now," as we say playfully to any of those who lightly undertake 
<A NAME="601"></A>the making of laws, "you see, legislator, the principles of government, 
<A NAME="602"></A>how many they are, and that they are naturally opposed to each other. There 
<A NAME="603"></A>we have discovered a fountain-head of seditions, to which you must attend. 
<A NAME="604"></A>And, first, we will ask you to consider with us, how and in what respect 
<A NAME="605"></A>the kings of Argos and Messene violated these our maxims, and ruined themselves 
<A NAME="606"></A>and the great and famous Hellenic power of the olden time. Was it because 
<A NAME="607"></A>they did not know how wisely Hesiod spoke when he said that the half is 
<A NAME="608"></A>often more than the whole? His meaning was, that when to take the whole 
<A NAME="609"></A>would be dangerous, and to take the half would be the safe and moderate 
<A NAME="610"></A>course, then the moderate or better was more than the immoderate or 
<A NAME="611"></A>worse."
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And may we suppose this immoderate spirit to be more fatal 
<A NAME="614"></A>when found among kings than when among peoples?
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> The probability is that ignorance will be a disorder 
<A NAME="616"></A>especially prevalent among kings, because they lead a proud and luxurious 
<A NAME="617"></A>life.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Is it not palpable that the chief aim of the kings 
<A NAME="619"></A>of that time was to get the better of the established laws, and that they 
<A NAME="620"></A>were not in harmony with the principles which they had agreed to observe 
<A NAME="621"></A>by word and oath? This want of harmony may have had the appearance of wisdom, 
<A NAME="622"></A>but was really, as we assert, the greatest ignorance, and utterly overthrew 
<A NAME="623"></A>the whole empire by dissonance and harsh discord.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very likely.
<A NAME="625"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Good; and what measures ought the legislator to have then 
<A NAME="626"></A>taken in order to avert this calamity? Truly there is no great wisdom in 
<A NAME="627"></A>knowing, and no great difficulty in telling, after the evil has happened; 
<A NAME="628"></A>but to have foreseen the remedy at the time would have taken a much wiser 
<A NAME="629"></A>head than ours.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Any one who looks at what has occurred with you Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="632"></A>Megillus, may easily know and may easily say what ought to have been done 
<A NAME="633"></A>at that time.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Speak a little more clearly.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Nothing can be clearer than the observation which I am 
<A NAME="636"></A>about to make.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="638"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> That if any one gives too great a power to anything, too 
<A NAME="639"></A>large a sail to a vessel, too much food to the body, too much authority 
<A NAME="640"></A>to the mind, and does not observe the mean, everything is overthrown, and, 
<A NAME="641"></A>in the wantonness of excess runs in the one case to disorders, and in the 
<A NAME="642"></A>other to injustice, which is the child of excess. I mean to say, my dear 
<A NAME="643"></A>friends, that there is no soul of man, young and irresponsible, who will 
<A NAME="644"></A>be able to sustain the temptation of arbitrary power-no one who will not, 
<A NAME="645"></A>under such circumstances, become filled with folly, that worst of diseases, 
<A NAME="646"></A>and be hated by his nearest and dearest friends: when this happens, his 
<A NAME="647"></A>kingdom is undermined, and all his power vanishes from him. And great legislators 
<A NAME="648"></A>who know the mean should take heed of the danger. As far as we can guess 
<A NAME="649"></A>at this distance of time, what happened was as follows:-
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> What?
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> A God, who watched over Sparta, seeing into the future, 
<A NAME="652"></A>gave you two families of kings instead of one; and thus brought you more 
<A NAME="653"></A>within the limits of moderation. In the next place, some human wisdom mingled 
<A NAME="654"></A>with divine power, observing that the constitution of your government was 
<A NAME="655"></A>still feverish and excited, tempered your inborn strength and pride of 
<A NAME="656"></A>birth with the moderation which comes of age, making the power of your 
<A NAME="657"></A>twenty-eight elders equal with that of the kings in the most important 
<A NAME="658"></A>matters. But your third saviour, perceiving that your government was still 
<A NAME="659"></A>swelling and foaming, and desirous to impose a curb upon it, instituted 
<A NAME="660"></A>the Ephors, whose power he made to resemble that of magistrates elected 
<A NAME="661"></A>by lot; and by this arrangement the kingly office, being compounded of 
<A NAME="662"></A>the right elements and duly moderated, was preserved, and was the means 
<A NAME="663"></A>of preserving all the rest. Since, if there had been only the original 
<A NAME="664"></A>legislators, Temenus, Cresphontes, and their contemporaries, as far as 
<A NAME="665"></A>they were concerned not even the portion of Aristodemus would have been 
<A NAME="666"></A>preserved; for they had no proper experience in legislation, or they would 
<A NAME="667"></A>surely not have imagined that oaths would moderate a youthful spirit invested 
<A NAME="668"></A>with a power which might be converted into a tyranny. Now that God has 
<A NAME="669"></A>instructed us what sort of government would have been or will be lasting, 
<A NAME="670"></A>there is no wisdom, as I have already said, in judging after the event; 
<A NAME="671"></A>there is no difficulty in learning from an example which has already occurred. 
<A NAME="672"></A>But if any one could have foreseen all this at the time, and had been able 
<A NAME="673"></A>to moderate the government of the three kingdoms and unite them into one, 
<A NAME="674"></A>he might have saved all the excellent institutions which were then conceived; 
<A NAME="675"></A>and no Persian or any other armament would have dared to attack us, or 
<A NAME="676"></A>would have regarded Hellas as a power to be despised.
<A NAME="677"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> There was small credit to us, Cleinias, in defeating them; 
<A NAME="679"></A>and the discredit was, not that the conquerors did not win glorious victories 
<A NAME="680"></A>both by land and sea, but what, in my opinion, brought discredit was, first 
<A NAME="681"></A>of all, the circumstance that of the three cities one only fought on behalf 
<A NAME="682"></A>of Hellas, and the two others were so utterly good for nothing that the 
<A NAME="683"></A>one was waging a mighty war against Lacedaemon, and was thus preventing 
<A NAME="684"></A>her from rendering assistance, while the city of Argos, which had the precedence 
<A NAME="685"></A>at the time of the distribution, when asked to aid in repelling the barbarian, 
<A NAME="686"></A>would not answer to the call, or give aid. Many things might be told about 
<A NAME="687"></A>Hellas in connection with that war which are far from honourable; nor, 
<A NAME="688"></A>indeed, can we rightly say that Hellas repelled the invader; for the truth 
<A NAME="689"></A>is, that unless the Athenians and Lacedaemonians, acting in concert, had 
<A NAME="690"></A>warded off the impending yoke, all the tribes of Hellas would have been 
<A NAME="691"></A>fused in a chaos of Hellenes mingling with one another, of barbarians mingling 
<A NAME="692"></A>with Hellenes, and Hellenes with barbarians; just as nations who are now 
<A NAME="693"></A>subject to the Persian power, owing to unnatural separations and combinations 
<A NAME="694"></A>of them, are dispersed and scattered, and live miserably. These, Cleinias 
<A NAME="695"></A>and Megillus, are the reproaches which we have to make against statesmen 
<A NAME="696"></A>and legislators, as they are called, past and present, if we would analyse 
<A NAME="697"></A>the causes of their failure, and find out what else might have been done. 
<A NAME="698"></A>We said, for instance, just now, that there ought to be no great and unmixed 
<A NAME="699"></A>powers; and this was under the idea that a state ought to be free and wise 
<A NAME="700"></A>and harmonious, and that a legislator ought to legislate with a view to 
<A NAME="701"></A>this end. Nor is there any reason to be surprised at our continually proposing 
<A NAME="702"></A>aims for the legislator which appear not to be always the same; but we 
<A NAME="703"></A>should consider when we say that temperance is to be the aim, or wisdom 
<A NAME="704"></A>is to be the aim, or friendship is to be the aim, that all these aims are 
<A NAME="705"></A>really the same; and if so, a variety in the modes of expression ought 
<A NAME="706"></A>not to disturb us.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Let us resume the argument in that spirit. And now, 
<A NAME="708"></A>speaking of friendship and wisdom and freedom, I wish that you would tell 
<A NAME="709"></A>me at what, in your opinion, the legislator should aim.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Hear me, then: there are two mother forms of states 
<A NAME="711"></A>from which the rest may be truly said to be derived; and one of them may 
<A NAME="712"></A>be called monarchy and the other democracy: the Persians have the highest 
<A NAME="713"></A>form of the one, and we of the other; almost all the rest, as I was saying, 
<A NAME="714"></A>are variations of these. Now, if you are to have liberty and the combination 
<A NAME="715"></A>of friendship with wisdom, you must have both these forms of government 
<A NAME="716"></A>in a measure; the argument emphatically declares that no city can be well 
<A NAME="717"></A>governed which is not made up of both.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Impossible.
<A NAME="719"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Neither the one, if it be exclusively and excessively attached 
<A NAME="720"></A>to monarchy, nor the other, if it be similarly attached to freedom, observes 
<A NAME="721"></A>moderation; but your states, the Laconian and Cretan, have more of it; 
<A NAME="722"></A>and the same was the case with the Athenians and Persians of old time, 
<A NAME="723"></A>but now they have less. Shall I tell you why?
<A NAME="724"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> By all means, if it will tend to elucidate our 
<A NAME="725"></A>subject.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Hear, then:-There was a time when the Persians had more 
<A NAME="727"></A>of the state which is a mean between slavery and freedom. In the reign 
<A NAME="728"></A>of Cyrus they were freemen and also lords of many others: the rulers gave 
<A NAME="729"></A>a share of freedom to the subjects, and being treated as equals, the soldiers 
<A NAME="730"></A>were on better terms with their generals, and showed themselves more ready 
<A NAME="731"></A>in the hour of danger. And if there was any wise man among them, who was 
<A NAME="732"></A>able to give good counsel, he imparted his wisdom to the public; for the 
<A NAME="733"></A>king was not jealous, but allowed him full liberty of speech, and gave 
<A NAME="734"></A>honour to those who could advise him in any matter. And the nation waxed 
<A NAME="735"></A>in all respects, because there was freedom and friendship and communion 
<A NAME="736"></A>of mind among them.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That certainly appears to have been the 
<A NAME="738"></A>case.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> How, then, was this advantage lost under Cambyses, and 
<A NAME="740"></A>again recovered under Darius? Shall I try to divine?
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> The enquiry, no doubt, has a bearing upon our 
<A NAME="742"></A>subject.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I imagine that Cyrus, though a great and patriotic general, 
<A NAME="744"></A>had never given his mind to education, and never attended to the order 
<A NAME="745"></A>of his household.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What makes you say so?
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I think that from his youth upwards he was a soldier, and 
<A NAME="748"></A>entrusted the education of his children to the women; and they brought 
<A NAME="749"></A>them up from their childhood as the favourites of fortune, who were blessed 
<A NAME="750"></A>already, and needed no more blessings. They thought that they were happy 
<A NAME="751"></A>enough, and that no one should be allowed to oppose them in any way, and 
<A NAME="752"></A>they compelled every one to praise all that they said or did. This was 
<A NAME="753"></A>how they brought them up.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> A splendid education truly!
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Such an one as women were likely to give them, and especially 
<A NAME="756"></A>princesses who had recently grown rich, and in the absence of the men, 
<A NAME="757"></A>too, who were occupied in wars and dangers, and had no time to look after 
<A NAME="758"></A>them.
<A NAME="759"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What would you expect?
<A NAME="760"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Their father had possessions of cattle and sheep, and many 
<A NAME="761"></A>herds of men and other animals, but he did not consider that those to whom 
<A NAME="762"></A>he was about to make them over were not trained in his own calling, which 
<A NAME="763"></A>was Persian; for the Persians are shepherds-sons of a rugged land, which 
<A NAME="764"></A>is a stern mother, and well fitted to produce sturdy race able to live 
<A NAME="765"></A>in the open air and go without sleep, and also to fight, if fighting is 
<A NAME="766"></A>required. He did not observe that his sons were trained differently; through 
<A NAME="767"></A>the so-called blessing of being royal they were educated in the Median 
<A NAME="768"></A>fashion by women and eunuchs, which led to their becoming such as people 
<A NAME="769"></A>do become when they are brought up unreproved. And so, after the death 
<A NAME="770"></A>of Cyrus, his sons, in the fulness of luxury and licence, took the kingdom, 
<A NAME="771"></A>and first one slew the other because he could not endure a rival; and, 
<A NAME="772"></A>afterwards, the slayer himself, mad with wine and brutality, lost his kingdom 
<A NAME="773"></A>through the Medes and the Eunuch, as they called him, who despised the 
<A NAME="774"></A>folly of Cambyses.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> So runs the tale, and such probably were the 
<A NAME="776"></A>facts.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes; and the tradition says, that the empire came back 
<A NAME="778"></A>to the Persians, through Darius and the seven chiefs.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us note the rest of the story. Observe, that Darius 
<A NAME="781"></A>was not the son of a king, and had not received a luxurious education. 
<A NAME="782"></A>When he came to the throne, being one of the seven, he divided the country 
<A NAME="783"></A>into seven portions, and of this arrangement there are some shadowy traces 
<A NAME="784"></A>still remaining; he made laws upon the principle of introducing universal 
<A NAME="785"></A>equality in the order of the state, and he embodied in his laws the settlement 
<A NAME="786"></A>of the tribute which Cyrus promised-thus creating a feeling of friendship 
<A NAME="787"></A>and community among all the Persians, and attaching the people to him with 
<A NAME="788"></A>money and gifts. Hence his armies cheerfully acquired for him countries 
<A NAME="789"></A>as large as those which Cyrus had left behind him. Darius was succeeded 
<A NAME="790"></A>by his son Xerxes; and he again was brought up in the royal and luxurious 
<A NAME="791"></A>fashion. Might we not most justly say: "O Darius, how came you to bring 
<A NAME="792"></A>up Xerxes in the same way in which Cyrus brought up Cambyses, and not to 
<A NAME="793"></A>see his fatal mistake?" For Xerxes, being the creation of the same education, 
<A NAME="794"></A>met with much the same fortune as Cambyses; and from that time until now 
<A NAME="795"></A>there has never been a really great king among the Persians, although they 
<A NAME="796"></A>are all called Great. And their degeneracy is not to be attributed to chance, 
<A NAME="797"></A>as I maintain; the reason is rather the evil life which is generally led 
<A NAME="798"></A>by the sons of very rich and royal persons; for never will boy or man, 
<A NAME="799"></A>young or old, excel in virtue, who has been thus educated. And this, I 
<A NAME="800"></A>say, is what the legislator has to consider, and what at the present moment 
<A NAME="801"></A>has to be considered by us. Justly may you, O Lacedaemonians, be praised, 
<A NAME="802"></A>in that you do not give special honour or a special education to wealth 
<A NAME="803"></A>rather than to poverty, or to a royal rather than to a private station, 
<A NAME="804"></A>where the divine and inspired lawgiver has not originally commanded them 
<A NAME="805"></A>to be given. For no man ought to have pre-eminent honour in a state because 
<A NAME="806"></A>he surpasses others in wealth, any more than because he is swift of foot 
<A NAME="807"></A>or fair or strong, unless he have some virtue in him; nor even if he have 
<A NAME="808"></A>virtue, unless he have this particular virtue of temperance.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> What do you mean, Stranger?
<A NAME="810"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I suppose that courage is a part of 
<A NAME="811"></A>virtue?
<A NAME="812"></A><BR><B>Meg.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then, now hear and judge for yourself:-Would you like to 
<A NAME="814"></A>have for a fellow-lodger or neighbour a very courageous man, who had no 
<A NAME="815"></A>control over himself?
<A NAME="816"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Heaven forbid!
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Or an artist, who was clever in his profession, but a 
<A NAME="818"></A>rogue?
<A NAME="819"></A><BR><B>Meg.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And surely justice does not grow apart from 
<A NAME="821"></A>temperance?
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><B>Meg.</B> Impossible.
<A NAME="823"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Any more than our pattern wise man, whom we exhibited as 
<A NAME="824"></A>having his pleasures and pains in accordance with and corresponding to 
<A NAME="825"></A>true reason, can be intemperate?
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> No.
<A NAME="827"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> There is a further consideration relating to the due and 
<A NAME="828"></A>undue award of honours in states.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="830"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I should like to know whether temperance without the other 
<A NAME="831"></A>virtues, existing alone in the soul of man, is rightly to be praised or 
<A NAME="832"></A>blamed?
<A NAME="833"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> I cannot tell.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And that is the best answer; for whichever alternative 
<A NAME="835"></A>you had chosen, I think that you would have gone wrong.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> I am fortunate.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Very good; a quality, which is a mere appendage of things 
<A NAME="838"></A>which can be praised or blamed, does not deserve an expression of opinion, 
<A NAME="839"></A>but is best passed over in silence.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> You are speaking of temperance?
<A NAME="841"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes; but of the other virtues, that which having this appendage 
<A NAME="842"></A>is also most beneficial, will be most deserving of honour, and next that 
<A NAME="843"></A>which is beneficial in the next degree; and so each of them will be rightly 
<A NAME="844"></A>honoured according to a regular order.
<A NAME="845"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> True.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And ought not the legislator to determine these 
<A NAME="847"></A>classes?
<A NAME="848"></A><BR><B>Meg.</B> Certainly he should.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Suppose that we leave to him the arrangement of details. 
<A NAME="850"></A>But the general division of laws according to their importance into a first 
<A NAME="851"></A>and second and third class, we who are lovers of law may make 
<A NAME="852"></A>ourselves.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Very; good.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> We maintain, then, that a State which would be safe and 
<A NAME="855"></A>happy, as far as the nature of man allows, must and ought to distribute 
<A NAME="856"></A>honour and dishonour in the right way. And the right way is to place the 
<A NAME="857"></A>goods of the soul first and highest in the scale, always assuming temperance 
<A NAME="858"></A>to be the condition of them; and to assign the second place to the goods 
<A NAME="859"></A>of the body; and the third place to money and property. And it any legislator 
<A NAME="860"></A>or state departs from this rule by giving money the place of honour, or 
<A NAME="861"></A>in any way preferring that which is really last, may we not say, that he 
<A NAME="862"></A>or the state is doing an unholy and unpatriotic thing?
<A NAME="863"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Yes; let that be plainly declared.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The consideration of the Persian governments led us thus 
<A NAME="865"></A>far to enlarge. We remarked that the Persians grew worse and worse. And 
<A NAME="866"></A>we affirm the reason of this to have been, that they too much diminished 
<A NAME="867"></A>the freedom of the people, and introduced too much of despotism, and so 
<A NAME="868"></A>destroyed friendship and community of feeling. And when there is an end 
<A NAME="869"></A>of these, no longer do the governors govern on behalf of their subjects 
<A NAME="870"></A>or of the people, but on behalf of themselves; and if they think that they 
<A NAME="871"></A>can gain ever so small an advantage for themselves, they devastate cities, 
<A NAME="872"></A>and send fire and desolation among friendly races. And as they hate ruthlessly 
<A NAME="873"></A>and horribly, so are they hated; and when they want the people to fight 
<A NAME="874"></A>for them, they find no community of feeling or willingness to risk their 
<A NAME="875"></A>lives on their behalf; their untold myriads are useless to them on the 
<A NAME="876"></A>field of battle, and they think that their salvation depends on the employment 
<A NAME="877"></A>of mercenaries and strangers whom they hire, as if they were in want of 
<A NAME="878"></A>more men. And they cannot help being stupid, since they proclaim by actions 
<A NAME="879"></A>that the ordinary distinctions of right and wrong which are made in a state 
<A NAME="880"></A>are a trifle, when compared with gold and silver.
<A NAME="881"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And now enough of the Persians, and their present maladministration 
<A NAME="883"></A>of their government, which is owing to the excess of slavery and despotism 
<A NAME="884"></A>among them.
<A NAME="885"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Good.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Next, we must pass in review the government of Attica in 
<A NAME="887"></A>like manner, and from this show that entire freedom and the absence of 
<A NAME="888"></A>all superior authority is not by any means so good as government by others 
<A NAME="889"></A>when properly limited, which was our ancient Athenian constitution at the 
<A NAME="890"></A>time when the Persians made their attack on Hellas, or, speaking more correctly, 
<A NAME="891"></A>on the whole continent of Europe. There were four classes, arranged according 
<A NAME="892"></A>to a property census, and reverence was our queen and mistress, and made 
<A NAME="893"></A>us willing to live in obedience to the laws which then prevailed. Also 
<A NAME="894"></A>the vastness of the Persian armament, both by sea and on land, caused a 
<A NAME="895"></A>helpless terror, which made us more and more the servants of our rulers 
<A NAME="896"></A>and of the laws; and for all these reasons an exceeding harmony prevailed 
<A NAME="897"></A>among us. About ten years before the naval engagement at Salamis, Datis 
<A NAME="898"></A>came, leading a Persian host by command of Darius, which was expressly 
<A NAME="899"></A>directed against the Athenians and Eretrians, having orders to carry them 
<A NAME="900"></A>away captive; and these orders he was to execute under pain of death. Now 
<A NAME="901"></A>Datis and his myriads soon became complete masters of Eretria, and he sent 
<A NAME="902"></A>a fearful report to Athens that no Eretrian had escaped him; for the soldiers 
<A NAME="903"></A>of Datis had joined hands and netted the whole of Eretria. And this report, 
<A NAME="904"></A>whether well or ill founded, was terrible to all the Hellenes, and above 
<A NAME="905"></A>all to the Athenians, and they dispatched embassies in all directions, 
<A NAME="906"></A>but no one was willing to come to their relief, with the exception of the 
<A NAME="907"></A>Lacedaemonians; and they, either because they were detained by the Messenian 
<A NAME="908"></A>war, which was then going on, or for some other reason of which we are 
<A NAME="909"></A>not told, came a day too late for the battle of Marathon. After a while, 
<A NAME="910"></A>the news arrived of mighty preparations being made, and innumerable threats 
<A NAME="911"></A>came from the king. Then, as time went on, a rumour reached us that Darius 
<A NAME="912"></A>had died, and that his son, who was young and hot-headed, had come to the 
<A NAME="913"></A>throne and was persisting in his design. The Athenians were under the impression 
<A NAME="914"></A>that the whole expedition was directed against them, in consequence of 
<A NAME="915"></A>the battle of Marathon; and hearing of the bridge over the Hellespont, 
<A NAME="916"></A>and the canal of Athos, and the host of ships, considering that there was 
<A NAME="917"></A>no salvation for them either by land or by sea, for there was no one to 
<A NAME="918"></A>help them, and remembering that in the first expedition, when the Persians 
<A NAME="919"></A>destroyed Eretria, no one came to their help, or would risk the danger 
<A NAME="920"></A>of an alliance with them, they thought that this would happen again, at 
<A NAME="921"></A>least on land; nor, when they looked to the sea, could they descry any 
<A NAME="922"></A>hope of salvation; for they were attacked by a thousand vessels and more. 
<A NAME="923"></A>One chance of safety remained, slight indeed and desperate, but their only 
<A NAME="924"></A>one. They saw that on the former occasion they had gained a seemingly impossible 
<A NAME="925"></A>victory, and borne up by this hope, they found that their only refuge was 
<A NAME="926"></A>in themselves and in the Gods. All these things created in them the spirit 
<A NAME="927"></A>of friendship; there was the fear of the moment, and there was that higher 
<A NAME="928"></A>fear, which they had acquired by obedience to their ancient laws, and which 
<A NAME="929"></A>I have several times in the preceding discourse called reverence, of which 
<A NAME="930"></A>the good man ought to be a willing servant, and of which the coward is 
<A NAME="931"></A>independent and fearless. If this fear had not possessed them, they would 
<A NAME="932"></A>never have met the enemy, or defended their temples and sepulchres and 
<A NAME="933"></A>their country, and everything that was near and dear to them, as they did; 
<A NAME="934"></A>but little by little they would have been all scattered and 
<A NAME="935"></A>dispersed.
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Your words, Athenian, are quite true, and worthy of 
<A NAME="937"></A>yourself and of your country.
<A NAME="938"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> They are true, Megillus; and to you, who have inherited 
<A NAME="939"></A>the virtues of your ancestors, I may properly speak of the actions of that 
<A NAME="940"></A>day. And I would wish you and Cleinias to consider whether my words have 
<A NAME="941"></A>not also a bearing on legislation; for I am not discoursing only for the 
<A NAME="942"></A>pleasure of talking, but for the argument's sake. Please to remark that 
<A NAME="943"></A>the experience both of ourselves and the Persians was, in a certain sense, 
<A NAME="944"></A>the same; for as they led their people into utter servitude, so we too 
<A NAME="945"></A>led ours into all freedom. And now, how shall we proceed? for I would like 
<A NAME="946"></A>you to observe that our previous arguments have good deal to say for 
<A NAME="947"></A>themselves.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> True; but I wish that you would give us a fuller 
<A NAME="949"></A>explanation.
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I will. Under the ancient laws, my friends, the people 
<A NAME="951"></A>was not as now the master, but rather the willing servant of the 
<A NAME="952"></A>laws.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> What laws do you mean?
<A NAME="954"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In the first place, let us speak of the laws about music-that 
<A NAME="955"></A>is to say, such music as then existed-in order that we may trace the growth 
<A NAME="956"></A>of the excess of freedom from the beginning. Now music was early divided 
<A NAME="957"></A>among us into certain kinds and manners. One sort consisted of prayers 
<A NAME="958"></A>to the Gods, which were called hymns; and there was another and opposite 
<A NAME="959"></A>sort called lamentations, and another termed paeans, and another, celebrating 
<A NAME="960"></A>the birth of Dionysus, called, I believe, "dithyrambs." And they used the 
<A NAME="961"></A>actual word "laws," or nomoi, for another kind of song; and to this they 
<A NAME="962"></A>added the term "citharoedic." All these and others were duly distinguished, 
<A NAME="963"></A>nor were the performers allowed to confuse one style of music with another. 
<A NAME="964"></A>And the authority which determined and gave judgment, and punished the 
<A NAME="965"></A>disobedient, was not expressed in a hiss, nor in the most unmusical shouts 
<A NAME="966"></A>of the multitude, as in our days, nor in applause and clapping of hands. 
<A NAME="967"></A>But the directors of public instruction insisted that the spectators should 
<A NAME="968"></A>listen in silence to the end; and boys and their tutors, and the multitude 
<A NAME="969"></A>in general, were kept quiet by a hint from a stick. Such was the good order 
<A NAME="970"></A>which the multitude were willing to observe; they would never have dared 
<A NAME="971"></A>to give judgment by noisy cries. And then, as time went on, the poets themselves 
<A NAME="972"></A>introduced the reign of vulgar and lawless innovation. They were men of 
<A NAME="973"></A>genius, but they had no perception of what is just and lawful in music; 
<A NAME="974"></A>raging like Bacchanals and possessed with inordinate delights-mingling 
<A NAME="975"></A>lamentations with hymns, and paeans with dithyrambs; imitating the sounds 
<A NAME="976"></A>of the flute on the lyre, and making one general confusion; ignorantly 
<A NAME="977"></A>affirming that music has no truth, and, whether good or bad, can only be 
<A NAME="978"></A>judged of rightly by the pleasure of the hearer. And by composing such 
<A NAME="979"></A>licentious works, and adding to them words as licentious, they have inspired 
<A NAME="980"></A>the multitude with lawlessness and boldness, and made them fancy that they 
<A NAME="981"></A>can judge for themselves about melody and song. And in this way the theatres 
<A NAME="982"></A>from being mute have become vocal, as though they had understanding of 
<A NAME="983"></A>good and bad in music and poetry; and instead of an aristocracy, an evil 
<A NAME="984"></A>sort of theatrocracy has grown up. For if the democracy which judged had 
<A NAME="985"></A>only consisted of educated persons, no fatal harm would have been done; 
<A NAME="986"></A>but in music there first arose the universal conceit of omniscience and 
<A NAME="987"></A>general lawlessness;-freedom came following afterwards, and men, fancying 
<A NAME="988"></A>that they knew what they did not know, had no longer any fear, and the 
<A NAME="989"></A>absence of fear begets shamelessness. For what is this shamelessness, which 
<A NAME="990"></A>is so evil a thing, but the insolent refusal to regard the opinion of the 
<A NAME="991"></A>better by reason of an over-daring sort of liberty?
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Consequent upon this freedom comes the other freedom, of 
<A NAME="994"></A>disobedience to rulers; and then the attempt to escape the control and 
<A NAME="995"></A>exhortation of father, mother, elders, and when near the end, the control 
<A NAME="996"></A>of the laws also; and at the very end there is the contempt of oaths and 
<A NAME="997"></A>pledges, and no regard at all for the Gods-herein they exhibit and imitate 
<A NAME="998"></A>the old so called Titanic nature, and come to the same point as the Titans 
<A NAME="999"></A>when they rebelled against God, leading a life of endless evils. But why 
<A NAME="1000"></A>have I said all this? I ask, because the argument ought to be pulled up 
<A NAME="1001"></A>from time to time, and not be allowed to run away, but held with bit and 
<A NAME="1002"></A>bridle, and then we shall not, as the proverb says, fall off our ass. Let 
<A NAME="1003"></A>us then once more ask the question, To what end has all this been 
<A NAME="1004"></A>said?
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> This, then, has been said for the sake-
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR><B>Meg.</B> Of what?
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> We were maintaining that the lawgiver ought to have three 
<A NAME="1009"></A>things in view: first, that the city for which he legislates should be 
<A NAME="1010"></A>free; and secondly, be at unity with herself; and thirdly, should have 
<A NAME="1011"></A>understanding;-these were our principles, were they 
<A NAME="1012"></A>not?
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> With a view to this we selected two kinds of government, 
<A NAME="1015"></A>the despotic, and the other the most free; and now we are considering which 
<A NAME="1016"></A>of them is the right form: we took a mean in both cases, of despotism in 
<A NAME="1017"></A>the one, and of liberty in the other, and we saw that in a mean they attained 
<A NAME="1018"></A>their perfection; but that when they were carried to the extreme of either, 
<A NAME="1019"></A>slavery or licence, neither party were the gainers.
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And that was our reason for considering the settlement 
<A NAME="1022"></A>of the Dorian army, and of the city built by Dardanus at the foot of the 
<A NAME="1023"></A>mountains, and the removal of cities to the seashore, and of our mention 
<A NAME="1024"></A>of the first men, who were the survivors of the deluge. And all that was 
<A NAME="1025"></A>previously said about music and drinking, and what preceded, was said with 
<A NAME="1026"></A>the view of seeing how a state might be best administered, and how an individual 
<A NAME="1027"></A>might best order his own life. And now, Megillus and Cleinias, how can 
<A NAME="1028"></A>we put to the proof the value of our words?
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Stranger, I think that I see how a proof of their value 
<A NAME="1030"></A>may be obtained. This discussion of ours appears to me to have been singularly 
<A NAME="1031"></A>fortunate, and just what I at this moment want; most auspiciously have 
<A NAME="1032"></A>you and my friend Megillus come in my way. For I will tell you what has 
<A NAME="1033"></A>happened to me; and I regard the coincidence as a sort of omen. The greater 
<A NAME="1034"></A>part of Crete is going to send out a colony, and they have entrusted the 
<A NAME="1035"></A>management of the affair to the Cnosians; and the Cnosian government to 
<A NAME="1036"></A>me and nine others. And they desire us to give them any laws which we please, 
<A NAME="1037"></A>whether taken from the Cretan model or from any other; and they do not 
<A NAME="1038"></A>mind about their being foreign if they are better. Grant me then this favour, 
<A NAME="1039"></A>which will also be a gain to yourselves:-Let us make a selection from what 
<A NAME="1040"></A>has been said, and then let us imagine a State of which we will suppose 
<A NAME="1041"></A>ourselves to be the original founders. Thus we shall proceed with our enquiry, 
<A NAME="1042"></A>and, at the same time, I may have the use of the framework which you are 
<A NAME="1043"></A>constructing, for the city which is in contemplation.
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Good news, Cleinias; if Megillus has no objection, 
<A NAME="1045"></A>you may be sure that I will do all in my power to please 
<A NAME="1046"></A>you.
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Thank you.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR><B>Meg.</B> And so will I.
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Excellent; and now let us begin to frame the 
<A NAME="1050"></A>State.
