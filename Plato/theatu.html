<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR><B>Euclid.</B> Have you only just arrived from the country, 
<A NAME="17"></A>Terpsion?
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR><B>Terpsion.</B> No, I came some time ago: and I have been in the 
<A NAME="19"></A>Agora looking for you, and wondering that I could not find 
<A NAME="20"></A>you.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR><B>Euc.</B> But I was not in the city.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR><B>Terp.</B> Where then?
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR><B>Euc.</B> As I was going down to the harbour, I met Theaetetus-he 
<A NAME="24"></A>was being carried up to Athens from the army at Corinth.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR><B>Terp.</B> Was he alive or dead?
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR><B>Euc.</B> He was scarcely alive, for he has been badly wounded; 
<A NAME="27"></A>but he was suffering even more from the sickness which has broken out in 
<A NAME="28"></A>the army.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR><B>Terp.</B> The dysentery, you mean?
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR><B>Euc.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR><B>Terp.</B> Alas! what a loss he will be!
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR><B>Euc.</B> Yes, Terpsion, he is a noble fellow; only to-day I 
<A NAME="33"></A>heard some people highly praising his behaviour in this very 
<A NAME="34"></A>battle.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR><B>Terp.</B> No wonder; I should rather be surprised at hearing 
<A NAME="36"></A>anything else of him. But why did he go on, instead of stopping at 
<A NAME="37"></A>Megara?
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR><B>Euc.</B> He wanted to get home: although I entreated and advised 
<A NAME="39"></A>him to remain he would not listen to me; so I set him on his way, and turned 
<A NAME="40"></A>back, and then I remembered what Socrates had said of him, and thought 
<A NAME="41"></A>how remarkably this, like all his predictions, had been fulfilled. I believe 
<A NAME="42"></A>that he had seen him a little before his own death, when Theaetetus was 
<A NAME="43"></A>a youth, and he had a memorable conversation with him, which he repeated 
<A NAME="44"></A>to me when I came to Athens; he was full of admiration of his genius, and 
<A NAME="45"></A>said that he would most certainly be a great man, if he 
<A NAME="46"></A>lived.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR><B>Terp.</B> The prophecy has certainly been fulfilled; but what 
<A NAME="48"></A>was the conversation? can you tell me?
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR><B>Euc.</B> No, indeed, not offhand; but I took notes of it as 
<A NAME="50"></A>soon as I got home; these I filled up from memory, writing them out at 
<A NAME="51"></A>leisure; and whenever I went to Athens, I asked Socrates about any point 
<A NAME="52"></A>which I had forgotten, and on my return I made corrections; thus I have 
<A NAME="53"></A>nearly the whole conversation written down.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR><B>Terp.</B> I remember-you told me; and I have always been intending 
<A NAME="55"></A>to ask you to show me the writing, but have put off doing so; and now, 
<A NAME="56"></A>why should we not read it through?-having just come from the country, I 
<A NAME="57"></A>should greatly like to rest.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR><B>Euc.</B> I too shall be very glad of a rest, for I went with 
<A NAME="59"></A>Theaetetus as far as Erineum. Let us go in, then, and, while we are reposing, 
<A NAME="60"></A>the servant shall read to us.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR><B>Terp.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR><B>Euc.</B> Here is the roll, Terpsion; I may observe that I have 
<A NAME="63"></A>introduced Socrates, not as narrating to me, but as actually conversing 
<A NAME="64"></A>with the persons whom he mentioned-these were, Theodorus the geometrician 
<A NAME="65"></A>(of Cyrene), and Theaetetus. I have omitted, for the sake of convenience, 
<A NAME="66"></A>the interlocutory words "I said," "I remarked," which he used when he spoke 
<A NAME="67"></A>of himself, and again, "he agreed," or "disagreed," in the answer, lest 
<A NAME="68"></A>the repetition of them should be troublesome.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR><B>Terp.</B> Quite right, Euclid.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR><B>Euc.</B> And now, boy, you may take the roll and 
<A NAME="71"></A>read.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>Euclid's servant reads.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR><B>Socrates.</B> If I cared enough about the Cyrenians, Theodorus, 
<A NAME="74"></A>I would ask you whether there are any rising geometricians or philosophers 
<A NAME="75"></A>in that part of the world. But I am more interested in our own Athenian 
<A NAME="76"></A>youth, and I would rather know who among them are likely to do well. I 
<A NAME="77"></A>observe them as far as I can myself, and I enquire of any one whom they 
<A NAME="78"></A>follow, and I see that a great many of them follow you, in which they are 
<A NAME="79"></A>quite right, considering your eminence in geometry and in other ways. Tell 
<A NAME="80"></A>me then, if you have met with any one who is good for 
<A NAME="81"></A>anything.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR><B>Theodorus.</B> Yes, Socrates, I have become acquainted with 
<A NAME="83"></A>one very remarkable Athenian youth, whom I commend to you as well worthy 
<A NAME="84"></A>of your attention. If he had been a beauty I should have been afraid to 
<A NAME="85"></A>praise him, lest you should suppose that I was in love with him; but he 
<A NAME="86"></A>is no beauty, and you must not be offended if I say that he is very like 
<A NAME="87"></A>you; for he has a snub nose and projecting eyes, although these features 
<A NAME="88"></A>are less marked in him than in you. Seeing, then, that he has no personal 
<A NAME="89"></A>attractions, I may freely say, that in all my acquaintance, which is very 
<A NAME="90"></A>large, I never knew anyone who was his equal in natural gifts: for he has 
<A NAME="91"></A>a quickness of apprehension which is almost unrivalled, and he is exceedingly 
<A NAME="92"></A>gentle, and also the most courageous of men; there is a union of qualities 
<A NAME="93"></A>in him such as I have never seen in any other, and should scarcely have 
<A NAME="94"></A>thought possible; for those who, like him, have quick and ready and retentive 
<A NAME="95"></A>wits, have generally also quick tempers; they are ships without ballast, 
<A NAME="96"></A>and go darting about, and are mad rather than courageous; and the steadier 
<A NAME="97"></A>sort, when they have to face study, prove stupid and cannot remember. Whereas 
<A NAME="98"></A>he moves surely and smoothly and successfully in the path of knowledge 
<A NAME="99"></A>and enquiry; and he is full of gentleness, flowing on silently like a river 
<A NAME="100"></A>of oil; at his age, it is wonderful.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That is good news; whose son is 
<A NAME="102"></A>he?
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> The name of his father I have forgotten, but the 
<A NAME="104"></A>youth himself is the middle one of those who are approaching us; he and 
<A NAME="105"></A>his companions have been anointing themselves in the outer court, and now 
<A NAME="106"></A>they seem to have finished, and are towards us. Look and see whether you 
<A NAME="107"></A>know him.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I know the youth, but I do not know his name; he is 
<A NAME="109"></A>the son of Euphronius the Sunian, who was himself an eminent man, and such 
<A NAME="110"></A>another as his son is, according to your account of him; I believe that 
<A NAME="111"></A>he left a considerable fortune.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> Theaetetus, Socrates, is his name; but I rather think 
<A NAME="113"></A>that the property disappeared in the hands of trustees; notwithstanding 
<A NAME="114"></A>which he is wonderfully liberal.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> He must be a fine fellow; tell him to come and sit 
<A NAME="116"></A>by me.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> I will. Come hither, Theaetetus, and sit by 
<A NAME="118"></A>Socrates.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> By all means, Theaetetus, in order that I may see the 
<A NAME="120"></A>reflection of myself in your face, for Theodorus says that we are alike; 
<A NAME="121"></A>and yet if each of us held in his hands a lyre, and he said that they were, 
<A NAME="122"></A>tuned alike, should we at once take his word, or should we ask whether 
<A NAME="123"></A>he who said so was or was not a musician?
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaetetus.</B> We should ask.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if we found that he was, we should take his word; 
<A NAME="126"></A>and if not, not?
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if this supposed, likeness of our faces is a matter 
<A NAME="129"></A>of any interest to us we should enquire whether he who says that we are 
<A NAME="130"></A>alike is a painter or not?
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly we should.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is Theodorus a painter?
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I never heard that he was.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Is he a geometrician?
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Of course he is, Socrates.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is he an astronomer and calculator and musician, 
<A NAME="137"></A>and in general an educated man?
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I think so.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> If, then, he remarks on a similarity in our persons, 
<A NAME="140"></A>either by way of praise or blame, there is no particular reason why we 
<A NAME="141"></A>should attend to him.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I should say not.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But if he praises the virtue or wisdom which are the 
<A NAME="144"></A>mental endowments of either of us, then he who hears the praises will naturally 
<A NAME="145"></A>desire to examine him who is praised: and he again should be willing to 
<A NAME="146"></A>exhibit himself.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very true, Socrates.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then now is the time, my dear Theaetetus, for me to 
<A NAME="149"></A>examine, and for you to exhibit; since although Theodorus has praised many 
<A NAME="150"></A>a citizen and stranger in my hearing, never did I hear him praise any one 
<A NAME="151"></A>as he has been praising you.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I am glad to hear it, Socrates; but what if he was 
<A NAME="153"></A>only in jest?
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Nay, Theodorus is not given to jesting; and I cannot 
<A NAME="155"></A>allow you to retract your consent on any such pretence as that. If you 
<A NAME="156"></A>do, he will have to swear to his words; and we are perfectly sure that 
<A NAME="157"></A>no one will be found to impugn him. Do not be shy then, but stand to your 
<A NAME="158"></A>word.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I suppose I must, if you wish 
<A NAME="160"></A>it.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> In the first place, I should like to ask what you learn 
<A NAME="162"></A>of Theodorus: something of geometry, perhaps?
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And astronomy and harmony and calculation?
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I do my best.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, my boy, and so do I: and my desire is to learn 
<A NAME="167"></A>of him, or of anybody who seems to understand these things. And I get on 
<A NAME="168"></A>pretty well in general; but there is a little difficulty which I want you 
<A NAME="169"></A>and the company to aid me in investigating. Will you answer me a question: 
<A NAME="170"></A>"Is not learning growing wiser about that which you 
<A NAME="171"></A>learn?"
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And by wisdom the wise are wise?
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is that different in any way from 
<A NAME="176"></A>knowledge?
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What?
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Wisdom; are not men wise in that which they 
<A NAME="179"></A>know?
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly they are.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then wisdom and knowledge are the 
<A NAME="182"></A>same?
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Herein lies the difficulty which I can never solve 
<A NAME="185"></A>to my satisfaction-What is knowledge? Can we answer that question? What 
<A NAME="186"></A>say you? which of us will speak first? whoever misses shall sit down, as 
<A NAME="187"></A>at a game of ball, and shall be donkey, as the boys say; he who lasts out 
<A NAME="188"></A>his competitors in the game without missing, shall be our king, and shall 
<A NAME="189"></A>have the right of putting to us any questions which he pleases. .. Why 
<A NAME="190"></A>is there no reply? I hope, Theodorus, that I am not betrayed into rudeness 
<A NAME="191"></A>by my love of conversation? I only want to make us talk and be friendly 
<A NAME="192"></A>and sociable.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> The reverse of rudeness, Socrates: but I would rather 
<A NAME="194"></A>that you would ask one of the young fellows; for the truth is, that I am 
<A NAME="195"></A>unused to your game of question and answer, and I am too old to learn; 
<A NAME="196"></A>the young will be more suitable, and they will improve more than I shall, 
<A NAME="197"></A>for youth is always able to improve. And so having made a beginning with 
<A NAME="198"></A>Theaetetus, I would advise you to go on with him and not let him 
<A NAME="199"></A>off.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do you hear, Theaetetus, what Theodorus says? The philosopher, 
<A NAME="201"></A>whom you would not like to disobey, and whose word ought to be a command 
<A NAME="202"></A>to a young man, bids me interrogate you. Take courage, then, and nobly 
<A NAME="203"></A>say what you think that knowledge is.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Well, Socrates, I will answer as you and he bid 
<A NAME="205"></A>me; and if make a mistake, you will doubtless correct 
<A NAME="206"></A>me.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> We will, if we can.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Then, I think that the sciences which I learn from 
<A NAME="209"></A>Theodorus-geometry, and those which you just now mentioned-are knowledge; 
<A NAME="210"></A>and I would include the art of the cobbler and other craftsmen; these, 
<A NAME="211"></A>each and all of, them, are knowledge.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Too much, Theaetetus, too much; the nobility and liberality 
<A NAME="213"></A>of your nature make you give many and diverse things, when I am asking 
<A NAME="214"></A>for one simple thing.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What do you mean, Socrates?
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Perhaps nothing. I will endeavour, however, to explain 
<A NAME="217"></A>what I believe to be my meaning: When you speak of cobbling, you mean the 
<A NAME="218"></A>art or science of making shoes?
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Just so.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And when you speak of carpentering, you mean the art 
<A NAME="221"></A>of making wooden implements?
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I do.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> In both cases you define the subject matter of each 
<A NAME="224"></A>of the two arts?
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But that, Theaetetus, was not the point of my question: 
<A NAME="227"></A>we wanted to know not the subjects, nor yet the number of the arts or sciences, 
<A NAME="228"></A>for we were not going to count them, but we wanted to know the nature of 
<A NAME="229"></A>knowledge in the abstract. Am I not right?
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Perfectly right.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let me offer an illustration: Suppose that a person 
<A NAME="232"></A>were to ask about some very trivial and obvious thing-for example, What 
<A NAME="233"></A>is clay? and we were to reply, that there is a clay of potters, there is 
<A NAME="234"></A>a clay of oven-makers, there is a clay of brick-makers; would not the answer 
<A NAME="235"></A>be ridiculous?
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Truly.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> In the first place, there would be an absurdity in 
<A NAME="238"></A>assuming that he who asked the question would understand from our answer 
<A NAME="239"></A>the nature of "clay," merely because we added "of the image-makers," or 
<A NAME="240"></A>of any other workers. How can a man understand the name of anything, when 
<A NAME="241"></A>he does not know the nature of it?
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> He cannot.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then he who does not know what science or knowledge 
<A NAME="244"></A>is, has no knowledge of the art or science of making 
<A NAME="245"></A>shoes?
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> None.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Nor of any other science?
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> No.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And when a man is asked what science or knowledge is, 
<A NAME="250"></A>to give in answer the name of some art or science is ridiculous; for the 
<A NAME="251"></A>-question is, "What is knowledge?" and he replies, "A knowledge of this 
<A NAME="252"></A>or that."
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Moreover, he might answer shortly and simply, but he 
<A NAME="255"></A>makes an enormous circuit. For example, when asked about the day, he might 
<A NAME="256"></A>have said simply, that clay is moistened earth-what sort of clay is not 
<A NAME="257"></A>to the point.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, Socrates, there is no difficulty as you put 
<A NAME="259"></A>the question. You mean, if I am not mistaken, something like what occurred 
<A NAME="260"></A>to me and to my friend here, your namesake Socrates, in a recent 
<A NAME="261"></A>discussion.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What was that, Theaetetus?
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Theodorus was writing out for us something about 
<A NAME="264"></A>roots, such as the roots of three or five, showing that they are incommensurable 
<A NAME="265"></A>by the unit: he selected other examples up to seventeen-there he stopped. 
<A NAME="266"></A>Now as there are innumerable roots, the notion occurred to us of attempting 
<A NAME="267"></A>to include them all under one name or class.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And did you find such a class?
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I think that we did; but I should like to have your 
<A NAME="270"></A>opinion.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let me hear.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> We divided all numbers into two classes: those which 
<A NAME="273"></A>are made up of equal factors multiplying into one another, which we compared 
<A NAME="274"></A>to square figures and called square or equilateral numbers;-that was one 
<A NAME="275"></A>class.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> The intermediate numbers, such as three and five, 
<A NAME="278"></A>and every other number which is made up of unequal factors, either of a 
<A NAME="279"></A>greater multiplied by a less, or of a less multiplied by a greater, and 
<A NAME="280"></A>when regarded as a figure, is contained in unequal sides;-all these we 
<A NAME="281"></A>compared to oblong figures, and called them oblong numbers.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Capital; and what followed?
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> The lines, or sides, which have for their squares 
<A NAME="284"></A>the equilateral plane numbers, were called by us lengths or magnitudes; 
<A NAME="285"></A>and the lines which are the roots of (or whose squares are equal to) the 
<A NAME="286"></A>oblong numbers, were called powers or roots; the reason of this latter 
<A NAME="287"></A>name being, that they are commensurable with the former <BR><I>i.e., with 
<A NAME="288"></A>the so-called lengths or magnitudes</I>
<A NAME="289"></A>not in linearmeasurement, but in the value of the superficial content of 
<A NAME="290"></A>their squares; and the same about solids.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Excellent, my boys; I think that you fully justify 
<A NAME="292"></A>the praises of Theodorus, and that he will not be found guilty of false 
<A NAME="293"></A>witness.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> But I am unable, Socrates, to give you a similar 
<A NAME="295"></A>answer about knowledge, which is what you appear to want; and therefore 
<A NAME="296"></A>Theodorus is a deceiver after all.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, but if some one were to praise you for running, 
<A NAME="298"></A>and to say that he never met your equal among boys, and afterwards you 
<A NAME="299"></A>were beaten in a race by a grown-up man, who was a great runner-would the 
<A NAME="300"></A>praise be any the less true?
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is the discovery of the nature of knowledge so 
<A NAME="303"></A>small a matter, as just now said? Is it not one which would task the powers 
<A NAME="304"></A>of men perfect in every way?
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> By heaven, they should be the top of all 
<A NAME="306"></A>perfection!
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, then, be of good cheer; do not say that Theodorus 
<A NAME="308"></A>was mistaken about you, but do your best to ascertain the true nature of 
<A NAME="309"></A>knowledge, as well as of other things.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I am eager enough, Socrates, if that would bring 
<A NAME="311"></A>to light the truth.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Come, you made a good beginning just now; let your 
<A NAME="313"></A>own answer about roots be your model, and as you comprehended them all 
<A NAME="314"></A>in one class, try and bring the many sorts of knowledge under one 
<A NAME="315"></A>definition.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I can assure you, Socrates, that I have tried very 
<A NAME="317"></A>often, when the report of questions asked by you was brought to me; but 
<A NAME="318"></A>I can neither persuade myself that I have a satisfactory answer to give, 
<A NAME="319"></A>nor hear of any one who answers as you would have him; and I cannot shake 
<A NAME="320"></A>off a feeling of anxiety.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> These are the pangs of labour, my dear Theaetetus; 
<A NAME="322"></A>you have something within you which you are bringing to the 
<A NAME="323"></A>birth.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I do not know, Socrates; I only say what I 
<A NAME="325"></A>feel.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And have you never heard, simpleton, that I am the 
<A NAME="327"></A>son of a midwife, brave and burly, whose name was Phaenarete?
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, I have.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And that I myself practise midwifery?
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> No, never.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let me tell you that I do though, my friend: but you 
<A NAME="332"></A>must not reveal the secret, as the world in general have not found me out; 
<A NAME="333"></A>and therefore they only say of me, that I am the strangest of mortals and 
<A NAME="334"></A>drive men to their wits' end. Did you ever hear that 
<A NAME="335"></A>too?
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Shall I tell you the reason?
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Bear in mind the whole business of the mid-wives, and 
<A NAME="340"></A>then you will see my meaning better:-No woman, as you are probably aware, 
<A NAME="341"></A>who is still able to conceive and bear, attends other women, but only those 
<A NAME="342"></A>who are past bearing.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes; I know.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The reason of this is said to be that Artemis-the goddess 
<A NAME="345"></A>of childbirth-is not a mother, and she honours those who are like herself; 
<A NAME="346"></A>but she could not allow the barren to be mid-wives, because human nature 
<A NAME="347"></A>cannot know the mystery of an art without experience; and therefore she 
<A NAME="348"></A>assigned this office to those who are too old to bear.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I dare say.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And I dare say too, or rather I am absolutely certain, 
<A NAME="351"></A>that the mid-wives know better than others who is pregnant and who is 
<A NAME="352"></A>not?
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And by the use of potions and incantations they are 
<A NAME="355"></A>able to arouse the pangs and to soothe them at will; they can make those 
<A NAME="356"></A>bear who have a difficulty in bearing, and if they think fit they can smother 
<A NAME="357"></A>the embryo in the womb.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> They can.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Did you ever remark that they are also most cunning 
<A NAME="360"></A>matchmakers, and have a thorough knowledge of what unions are likely to 
<A NAME="361"></A>produce a brave brood?
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> No, never.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then let me tell you that this is their greatest pride, 
<A NAME="364"></A>more than cutting the umbilical cord. And if you reflect, you will see 
<A NAME="365"></A>that the same art which cultivates and gathers in the fruits of the earth, 
<A NAME="366"></A>will be most likely to know in what soils the several plants or seeds should 
<A NAME="367"></A>be deposited.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, the same art.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And do you suppose that with women the case is 
<A NAME="370"></A>otherwise?
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I should think not.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Certainly not; but mid-wives are respectable women 
<A NAME="373"></A>who have a character to lose, and they avoid this department of their profession, 
<A NAME="374"></A>because they are afraid of being called procuresses, which is a name given 
<A NAME="375"></A>to those who join together man and woman in an unlawful and unscientific 
<A NAME="376"></A>way; and yet the true midwife is also the true and only 
<A NAME="377"></A>matchmaker.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Clearly.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Such are the mid-wives, whose task is a very important 
<A NAME="380"></A>one but not so important as mine; for women do not bring into the world 
<A NAME="381"></A>at one time real children, and at another time counterfeits which are with 
<A NAME="382"></A>difficulty distinguished from them; if they did, then the, discernment 
<A NAME="383"></A>of the true and false birth would be the crowning achievement of the art 
<A NAME="384"></A>of midwifery-you would think so?
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Indeed I should.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, my art of midwifery is in most respects like 
<A NAME="387"></A>theirs; but differs, in that I attend men and not women; and look after 
<A NAME="388"></A>their souls when they are in labour, and not after their bodies: and the 
<A NAME="389"></A>triumph of my art is in thoroughly examining whether the thought which 
<A NAME="390"></A>the mind of the young man brings forth is a false idol or a noble and true 
<A NAME="391"></A>birth. And like the mid-wives, I am barren, and the reproach which is often 
<A NAME="392"></A>made against me, that I ask questions of others and have not the wit to 
<A NAME="393"></A>answer them myself, is very just-the reason is, that the god compels-me 
<A NAME="394"></A>to be a midwife, but does not allow me to bring forth. And therefore I 
<A NAME="395"></A>am not myself at all wise, nor have I anything to show which is the invention 
<A NAME="396"></A>or birth of my own soul, but those who converse with me profit. Some of 
<A NAME="397"></A>them appear dull enough at first, but afterwards, as our acquaintance ripens, 
<A NAME="398"></A>if the god is gracious to them, they all make astonishing progress; and 
<A NAME="399"></A>this in the opinion of others as well as in their own. It is quite dear 
<A NAME="400"></A>that they never learned anything from me; the many fine discoveries to 
<A NAME="401"></A>which they cling are of their own making. But to me and the god they owe 
<A NAME="402"></A>their delivery. And the proof of my words is, that many of them in their 
<A NAME="403"></A>ignorance, either in their self-conceit despising me, or falling under 
<A NAME="404"></A>the influence of others, have gone away too soon; and have not only lost 
<A NAME="405"></A>the children of whom I had previously delivered them by an ill bringing 
<A NAME="406"></A>up, but have stifled whatever else they had in them by evil communications, 
<A NAME="407"></A>being fonder of lies and shams than of the truth; and they have at last 
<A NAME="408"></A>ended by seeing themselves, as others see them, to be great fools. Aristeides, 
<A NAME="409"></A>the son of Lysimachus, is one of them, and there are many others. The truants 
<A NAME="410"></A>often return to me, and beg that I would consort with them again-they are 
<A NAME="411"></A>ready to go to me on their knees and then, if my familiar allows, which 
<A NAME="412"></A>is not always the case, I receive them, and they begin to grow again. Dire 
<A NAME="413"></A>are the pangs which my art is able to arouse and to allay in those who 
<A NAME="414"></A>consort with me, just like the pangs of women in childbirth; night and 
<A NAME="415"></A>day they are full of perplexity and travail which is even worse than that 
<A NAME="416"></A>of the women. So much for them. And there are -others, Theaetetus, who 
<A NAME="417"></A>come to me apparently having nothing in them; and as I know that they have 
<A NAME="418"></A>no need of my art, I coax them into marrying some one, and by the grace 
<A NAME="419"></A>of God I can generally tell who is likely to do them good. Many of them 
<A NAME="420"></A>I have given away to Prodicus, and many to other inspired sages. I tell 
<A NAME="421"></A>you this long story, friend Theaetetus, because I suspect, as indeed you 
<A NAME="422"></A>seem to think yourself, that you are in labour-great with some conception. 
<A NAME="423"></A>Come then to me, who am a midwife's son and myself a midwife, and do your 
<A NAME="424"></A>best to answer the questions which I will ask you. And if I abstract and 
<A NAME="425"></A>expose your first-born, because I discover upon inspection that the conception 
<A NAME="426"></A>which you have formed is a vain shadow, do not quarrel with me on that 
<A NAME="427"></A>account, as the manner of women is when their first children are taken 
<A NAME="428"></A>from them. For I have actually known some who were ready to bite me when 
<A NAME="429"></A>I deprived them of a darling folly; they did not perceive that I acted 
<A NAME="430"></A>from good will, not knowing that no god is the enemy of man-that was not 
<A NAME="431"></A>within the range of their ideas; neither am I their enemy in all this, 
<A NAME="432"></A>but it would be wrong for me to admit falsehood, or to stifle the truth. 
<A NAME="433"></A>Once more, then, Theaetetus, I repeat my old question, "What is knowledge?"-and 
<A NAME="434"></A>do not say that you cannot tell; but quit yourself like a man, and by the 
<A NAME="435"></A>help of God you will be able to tell.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> At any rate, Socrates, after such an exhortation 
<A NAME="437"></A>I should be ashamed of not trying to do my best. Now he who knows perceives 
<A NAME="438"></A>what he knows, and, as far as I can see at present, knowledge is 
<A NAME="439"></A>perception.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Bravely said, boy; that is the way in which you should 
<A NAME="441"></A>express your opinion. And now, let us examine together this conception 
<A NAME="442"></A>of yours, and see whether it is a true birth or a mere, wind-egg:-You say 
<A NAME="443"></A>that knowledge is perception?
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, you have delivered yourself of a very important 
<A NAME="446"></A>doctrine about knowledge; it is indeed the opinion of Protagoras, who has 
<A NAME="447"></A>another way of expressing it, Man, he says, is the measure of all things, 
<A NAME="448"></A>of the existence of things that are, and of the non-existence of things 
<A NAME="449"></A>that are not:-You have read him?
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> O yes, again and again.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Does he not say that things are to you such as they 
<A NAME="452"></A>appear to you, and to me such as they appear to me, and that you and I 
<A NAME="453"></A>are men?
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, he says so.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> A wise man is not likely to talk nonsense. Let us try 
<A NAME="456"></A>to understand him: the same wind is blowing, and yet one of us may be cold 
<A NAME="457"></A>and the other not, or one may be slightly and the other very 
<A NAME="458"></A>cold?
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Now is the wind, regarded not in relation to us but 
<A NAME="461"></A>absolutely, cold or not; or are we to say, with Protagoras, that the wind 
<A NAME="462"></A>is cold to him who is cold, and not to him who is not?
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I suppose the last.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then it must appear so to each of 
<A NAME="465"></A>them?
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And "appears to him" means the same as "he 
<A NAME="468"></A>perceives."
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then appearing and perceiving coincide in the case 
<A NAME="471"></A>of hot and cold, and in similar instances; for things appear, or may be 
<A NAME="472"></A>supposed to be, to each one such as he perceives them?
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then perception is always of existence, and being the 
<A NAME="475"></A>same as knowledge is unerring?
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Clearly.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> In the name of the Graces, what an almighty wise man 
<A NAME="478"></A>Protagoras must have been! He spoke these things in a parable to the common 
<A NAME="479"></A>herd, like you and me, but told the truth, his Truth, in secret to his 
<A NAME="480"></A>own disciples.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What do you mean, Socrates?
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I am about to speak of a high argument, in which all 
<A NAME="483"></A>things are said to be relative; you cannot rightly call anything by any 
<A NAME="484"></A>name, such as great or small, heavy or light, for the great will be small 
<A NAME="485"></A>and the heavy light-there is no single thing or quality, but out of motion 
<A NAME="486"></A>and change and admixture all things are becoming relatively to one another, 
<A NAME="487"></A>which "becoming" is by us incorrectly called being, but is really becoming, 
<A NAME="488"></A>for nothing ever is, but all things are becoming. Summon all philosophers-Protagoras, 
<A NAME="489"></A>Heracleitus, Empedocles, and the rest of them, one after another, and with 
<A NAME="490"></A>the exception of Parmenides they will agree with you in this. Summon the 
<A NAME="491"></A>great masters of either kind of poetry-Epicharmus, the prince of Comedy, 
<A NAME="492"></A>and Homer of Tragedy; when the latter sings of
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR>Ocean whence sprang the gods, and mother Tethys, does he not mean 
<A NAME="494"></A>that all things are the offspring, of flux and motion?
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I think so.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And who could take up arms against such a great army 
<A NAME="497"></A>having Homer for its general, and not appear ridiculous?
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Who indeed, Socrates?
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, Theaetetus; and there are plenty of other proofs 
<A NAME="500"></A>which will show that motion is the source of what is called being and becoming, 
<A NAME="501"></A>and inactivity of not-being and destruction; for fire and warmth, which 
<A NAME="502"></A>are supposed to be the parent and guardian of all other things, are born 
<A NAME="503"></A>of movement and friction, which is a kind of motion;-is not this the origin 
<A NAME="504"></A>of fire?
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> It is.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the race of animals is generated in the same 
<A NAME="507"></A>way?
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is not the bodily habit spoiled by rest and idleness, 
<A NAME="510"></A>but preserved for a long time by motion and exercise?
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And what of the mental habit? Is not the soul informed, 
<A NAME="513"></A>and improved, and preserved by study and attention, which are motions; 
<A NAME="514"></A>but when at rest, which in the soul only means want of attention and study, 
<A NAME="515"></A>is uninformed, and speedily forgets whatever she has 
<A NAME="516"></A>learned?
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then motion is a good, and rest an evil, to the soul 
<A NAME="519"></A>as well as to the body?
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Clearly.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I may add, that breathless calm, stillness and the 
<A NAME="522"></A>like waste and impair, while wind and storm preserve; and the palmary argument 
<A NAME="523"></A>of all, which I strongly urge, is the golden chain in Homer, by which he 
<A NAME="524"></A>means the sun, thereby indicating that so long as the sun and the heavens 
<A NAME="525"></A>go round in their orbits, all things human and divine are and are preserved, 
<A NAME="526"></A>but if they were chained up and their motions ceased, then all things would 
<A NAME="527"></A>be destroyed, and, as the saying is, turned upside down.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I believe, Socrates, that you have truly explained 
<A NAME="529"></A>his meaning.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then now apply his doctrine to perception, my good 
<A NAME="531"></A>friend, and first of all to vision; that which you call white colour is 
<A NAME="532"></A>not in your eyes, and is not a distinct thing which exists out of them. 
<A NAME="533"></A>And you must not assign any place to it: for if it had position it would 
<A NAME="534"></A>be, and be at rest, and there would be no process of 
<A NAME="535"></A>becoming.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Then what is colour?
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let us carry the principle which has just been affirmed, 
<A NAME="538"></A>that nothing is self-existent, and then we shall see that white, black, 
<A NAME="539"></A>and every other colour, arises out of the eye meeting the appropriate motion, 
<A NAME="540"></A>and that what we call a colour is in each case neither the active nor the 
<A NAME="541"></A>passive element, but something which passes between them, and is peculiar 
<A NAME="542"></A>to each percipient; are you quite certain that the several colours appear 
<A NAME="543"></A>to a dog or to any animal whatever as they appear to 
<A NAME="544"></A>you?
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Far from it.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Or that anything appears the same to you as to another 
<A NAME="547"></A>man? Are you so profoundly convinced of this? Rather would it not be true 
<A NAME="548"></A>that it never appears exactly the same to you, because you are never exactly 
<A NAME="549"></A>the same?
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> The latter.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if that with which I compare myself in size, or 
<A NAME="552"></A>which I apprehend by touch, were great or white or hot, it could not become 
<A NAME="553"></A>different by mere contact with another unless it actually changed; nor 
<A NAME="554"></A>again, if the comparing or apprehending subject were great or white or 
<A NAME="555"></A>hot, could this, when unchanged from within become changed by any approximation 
<A NAME="556"></A>or affection of any other thing. The fact is that in our ordinary way of 
<A NAME="557"></A>speaking we allow ourselves to be driven into most ridiculous and wonderful 
<A NAME="558"></A>contradictions, as Protagoras and all who take his line of argument would 
<A NAME="559"></A>remark.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> How? and of what sort do you 
<A NAME="561"></A>mean?
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> A little instance will sufficiently explain my meaning: 
<A NAME="563"></A>Here are six dice, which are more by a half when compared with four, and 
<A NAME="564"></A>fewer by a half than twelve-they are more and also fewer. How can you or 
<A NAME="565"></A>any one maintain the contrary?
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, then, suppose that Protagoras or some one asks 
<A NAME="568"></A>whether anything can become greater or more if not by increasing, how would 
<A NAME="569"></A>you answer him, Theaetetus?
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I should say "No," Socrates, if I were to speak 
<A NAME="571"></A>my mind in reference to this last question, and if I were not afraid of 
<A NAME="572"></A>contradicting my former answer.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Capital excellent! spoken like an oracle, my boy! And 
<A NAME="574"></A>if you reply "Yes," there will be a case for Euripides; for our tongue 
<A NAME="575"></A>will be unconvinced, but not our mind.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The thoroughbred Sophists, who know all that can be 
<A NAME="578"></A>known about the mind, and argue only out of the superfluity of their wits, 
<A NAME="579"></A>would have had a regular sparring-match over this, and would -have knocked 
<A NAME="580"></A>their arguments together finely. But you and I, who have no professional 
<A NAME="581"></A>aims, only desire to see what is the mutual relation of these principles-whether 
<A NAME="582"></A>they are consistent with each or not.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, that would be my desire.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And mine too. But since this is our feeling, and there 
<A NAME="585"></A>is plenty of time, why should we not calmly and patiently review our own 
<A NAME="586"></A>thoughts, and thoroughly examine and see what these appearances in us really 
<A NAME="587"></A>are? If I am not mistaken, they will be described by us as follows:-first, 
<A NAME="588"></A>that nothing can become greater or less, either in number or magnitude, 
<A NAME="589"></A>while remaining equal to itself-you would agree?
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Secondly, that without addition or subtraction there 
<A NAME="592"></A>is no increase or diminution of anything, but only equality.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Thirdly, that what was not before cannot be afterwards, 
<A NAME="595"></A>without becoming and having become.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, truly.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> These three axioms, if I am not mistaken, are fighting 
<A NAME="598"></A>with one another in our minds in the case of the dice, or, again, in such 
<A NAME="599"></A>a case as this-if I were to say that I, who am of a certain height and 
<A NAME="600"></A>taller than you, may within a year, without gaining or losing in height, 
<A NAME="601"></A>be not so tall-not that I should have lost, but that you would have increased. 
<A NAME="602"></A>In such a case, I am afterwards what I once was not, and yet I have not 
<A NAME="603"></A>become; for I could not have become without becoming, neither could I have 
<A NAME="604"></A>become less without losing somewhat of my height; and I could give you 
<A NAME="605"></A>ten thousand examples of similar contradictions, if we admit them at all. 
<A NAME="606"></A>I believe that you follow me, Theaetetus; for I suspect that you have thought 
<A NAME="607"></A>of these questions before now.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, Socrates, and I am amazed when I think of them; 
<A NAME="609"></A>by the Gods I am! and I want to know what on earth they mean; and there 
<A NAME="610"></A>are times when my head quite swims with the contemplation of 
<A NAME="611"></A>them.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I see, my dear Theaetetus, that Theodorus had a true 
<A NAME="613"></A>insight into your nature when he said that you were a philosopher, for 
<A NAME="614"></A>wonder is the feeling of a philosopher, and philosophy begins in wonder. 
<A NAME="615"></A>He was not a bad genealogist who said that Iris (the messenger of heaven) 
<A NAME="616"></A>is the child of Thaumas (wonder). But do you begin to see what is the explanation 
<A NAME="617"></A>of this perplexity on the hypothesis which we attribute to 
<A NAME="618"></A>Protagoras?
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Not as yet.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then you will be obliged to me if I help you to unearth 
<A NAME="621"></A>the hidden "truth" of a famous man or school.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> To be sure, I shall be very much 
<A NAME="623"></A>obliged.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Take a look round, then, and see that none of the uninitiated 
<A NAME="625"></A>are listening. Now by the uninitiated I mean: the people who believe in 
<A NAME="626"></A>nothing but what they can grasp in their hands, and who will not allow 
<A NAME="627"></A>that action or generation or anything invisible can have real 
<A NAME="628"></A>existence.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, indeed, Socrates, they are very hard and impenetrable 
<A NAME="630"></A>mortals.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, my boy, outer barbarians. Far more ingenious are 
<A NAME="632"></A>the brethren whose mysteries I am about to reveal to you. Their first principle 
<A NAME="633"></A>is, that all is motion, and upon this all the affections of which we were 
<A NAME="634"></A>just now speaking, are supposed to depend: there is nothing but motion, 
<A NAME="635"></A>which has two forms, one active and the other passive, both in endless 
<A NAME="636"></A>number; and out of the union and friction of them there is generated a 
<A NAME="637"></A>progeny endless in number, having two forms, sense and the object of sense, 
<A NAME="638"></A>which are ever breaking forth and coming to the birth at the same moment. 
<A NAME="639"></A>The senses are variously named hearing, seeing, smelling; there is the 
<A NAME="640"></A>sense of heat, cold, pleasure, pain, desire, fear, and many more which 
<A NAME="641"></A>have names, as well as innumerable others which are without them; each 
<A NAME="642"></A>has its kindred object each variety of colour has a corresponding variety 
<A NAME="643"></A>of sight, and so with sound and hearing, and with the rest of the senses 
<A NAME="644"></A>and the objects akin to them. Do you see, Theaetetus, the bearings of this 
<A NAME="645"></A>tale on the preceding argument?
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Indeed I do not.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then attend, and I will try to finish the story. The 
<A NAME="648"></A>purport is that all these things are in motion, as I was saying, and that 
<A NAME="649"></A>this motion is of two kinds, a slower and a quicker; and the slower elements 
<A NAME="650"></A>have their motions in the same place and with reference to things near 
<A NAME="651"></A>them, and so they beget; but what is begotten is swifter, for it is carried 
<A NAME="652"></A>to fro, and moves from place to place. Apply this to sense:-When the eye 
<A NAME="653"></A>and the appropriate object meet together and give birth to whiteness and 
<A NAME="654"></A>the sensation connatural with it, which could not have been given by either 
<A NAME="655"></A>of them going elsewhere, then, while the sight: is flowing from the eye, 
<A NAME="656"></A>whiteness proceeds from the object which combines in producing the colour; 
<A NAME="657"></A>and so the eye is fulfilled with sight, and really sees, and becomes, not 
<A NAME="658"></A>sight, but a seeing eye; and the object which combined to form the colour 
<A NAME="659"></A>is fulfilled with whiteness, and becomes not whiteness but a white thing, 
<A NAME="660"></A>whether wood or stone or whatever the object may be which happens to be 
<A NAME="661"></A>colour,ed white. And this is true of all sensible objects, hard, warm, 
<A NAME="662"></A>and the like, which are similarly to be regarded, as I was saying before, 
<A NAME="663"></A>not as having any absolute existence, but as being all of them of whatever 
<A NAME="664"></A>kind. generated by motion in their intercourse with one another; for of 
<A NAME="665"></A>the agent and patient, as existing in separation, no trustworthy conception, 
<A NAME="666"></A>as they say, can be formed, for the agent has no existence until united; 
<A NAME="667"></A>with the patient, and the patient has no existence until united with the 
<A NAME="668"></A>agent; and that which by uniting with something becomes an agent, by meeting 
<A NAME="669"></A>with some other thing is converted into a patient. And from all these considerations, 
<A NAME="670"></A>as I said at first, there arises a general reflection, that there is no 
<A NAME="671"></A>one self-existent thing, but everything is becoming and in relation; and 
<A NAME="672"></A>being must be altogether abolished, although from habit and ignorance we 
<A NAME="673"></A>are compelled even in this discussion to retain the use of the term. But 
<A NAME="674"></A>great philosophers tell us that we are not to allow either the word "something," 
<A NAME="675"></A>or "belonging to something," or "to me," or "this," or "that," or any other 
<A NAME="676"></A>detaining name to be used, in the language of nature all things are being 
<A NAME="677"></A>created and destroyed, coming into being and passing into new forms; nor 
<A NAME="678"></A>can any name fix or detain them; he who attempts to fix them is easily 
<A NAME="679"></A>refuted. And this should be the way of speaking, not only of particulars 
<A NAME="680"></A>but of aggregates such aggregates as are expressed in the word "man," or 
<A NAME="681"></A>"stone," or any name of animal or of a class. O Theaetetus, are not these 
<A NAME="682"></A>speculations sweet as honey? And do you not like the taste of them in the 
<A NAME="683"></A>mouth?
<A NAME="684"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I do not know what to say, Socrates, for, indeed, 
<A NAME="685"></A>I cannot make out whether you are giving your own opinion or only wanting 
<A NAME="686"></A>to draw me out.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You forget, my friend, that I neither know, nor profess 
<A NAME="688"></A>to know, anything of! these matters; you are the person who is in labour, 
<A NAME="689"></A>I am the barren midwife; and this is why I soothe you, and offer you one 
<A NAME="690"></A>good thing after another, that you may taste them. And I hope that I may 
<A NAME="691"></A>at last help to bring your own opinion into the light of day: when this 
<A NAME="692"></A>has been accomplished, then we will determine whether what you have brought 
<A NAME="693"></A>forth is only a wind-egg or a real and genuine birth. Therefore, keep up 
<A NAME="694"></A>your spirits, and answer like a man what you think.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Ask me.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then once more: Is it your opinion that nothing is 
<A NAME="697"></A>but what becomes? the good and the noble, as well; as all the other things 
<A NAME="698"></A>which we were just now mentioning?
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> When I hear you discoursing in this style, I think 
<A NAME="700"></A>that there is a great deal in what you say, and I am very ready to assent. 
<A NAME="701"></A>Soc. Let us not leave the argument unfinished, then; for there still remains 
<A NAME="702"></A>to be considered an objection which may be raised about dreams and diseases, 
<A NAME="703"></A>in particular about madness, and the various illusions of hearing and sight, 
<A NAME="704"></A>or of other senses. For you know that in all these cases the esse-percipi 
<A NAME="705"></A>theory appears to be unmistakably refuted, since in dreams and illusions 
<A NAME="706"></A>we certainly have false perceptions; and far from saying that everything 
<A NAME="707"></A>is which appears, we should rather say that nothing is which 
<A NAME="708"></A>appears.
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very true, Socrates.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But then, my boy, how can any one contend that knowledge 
<A NAME="711"></A>is perception, or that to every man what appears is?
<A NAME="712"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I am afraid to say, Socrates, that I have nothing 
<A NAME="713"></A>to answer, because you rebuked me just now for making this excuse; but 
<A NAME="714"></A>I certainly cannot undertake to argue that madmen or dreamers think truly, 
<A NAME="715"></A>when they imagine, some of them that they are gods, and others that they 
<A NAME="716"></A>can fly, and are flying in their sleep.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do you see another question which can be raised about 
<A NAME="718"></A>these phenomena, notably about dreaming and waking?
<A NAME="719"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What question?
<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> A question which I think that you must often have heard 
<A NAME="721"></A>persons ask:-How can you determine whether at this moment we are sleeping, 
<A NAME="722"></A>and all our thoughts are a dream; or whether we are awake, and talking 
<A NAME="723"></A>to one another in the waking state?
<A NAME="724"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Indeed, Socrates, I do not know how to prove the 
<A NAME="725"></A>one any more than the other, for in both cases the facts precisely correspond;-and 
<A NAME="726"></A>there is no difficulty in supposing that during all this discussion we 
<A NAME="727"></A>have been talking to one another in a dream; and when in a dream we seem 
<A NAME="728"></A>to be narrating dreams, the resemblance of the two states is quite 
<A NAME="729"></A>astonishing.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You see, then, that a doubt about the reality of sense 
<A NAME="731"></A>is easily raised, since there may even be a doubt whether we are awake 
<A NAME="732"></A>or in a dream. And as our time is equally divided between sleeping and 
<A NAME="733"></A>waking, in either sphere of existence the soul contends that the thoughts 
<A NAME="734"></A>which are present to our minds at the time are true; and during one half 
<A NAME="735"></A>of our lives we affirm the truth of the one, and, during the other half, 
<A NAME="736"></A>of the other; and are equally confident of both.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And may not the same be said of madness and other disorders? 
<A NAME="739"></A>the difference is only that the times are not equal.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is truth or falsehood to be determined by duration 
<A NAME="742"></A>of time?
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> That would be in many ways ridiculous.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But can you certainly determine: by any other means 
<A NAME="745"></A>which of these opinions is true?
<A NAME="746"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I do not think that I can.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Listen, then to a statement of the other side of the 
<A NAME="748"></A>argument, which is made by the champions of appearance. They would say, 
<A NAME="749"></A>as I imagine-can that which is wholly other than something, have the same 
<A NAME="750"></A>quality as that from which it differs? and observe, -Theaetetus, that the 
<A NAME="751"></A>word "other" means not "partially," but "wholly other."
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly, putting the question as you do, that 
<A NAME="753"></A>which is wholly other cannot either potentially or in any other way be 
<A NAME="754"></A>the same.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And must therefore be admitted to be 
<A NAME="756"></A>unlike?
<A NAME="757"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> If, then, anything happens to become like or unlike 
<A NAME="759"></A>itself or another, when it becomes like we call it the same-when unlike, 
<A NAME="760"></A>other?
<A NAME="761"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Were we not saying that there. are agents many and 
<A NAME="763"></A>infinite, and patients many and infinite?
<A NAME="764"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And also that different combinations will produce results 
<A NAME="766"></A>which are not the same, but different?
<A NAME="767"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let us take you and me, or anything as an example:-There 
<A NAME="769"></A>is Socrates in health, and Socrates sick-Are they like or 
<A NAME="770"></A>unlike?
<A NAME="771"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> You mean to, compare Socrates in health as a whole, 
<A NAME="772"></A>and Socrates in sickness as a whole?
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Exactly; that is my meaning.
<A NAME="774"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I answer, they are unlike.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if unlike, they are other?
<A NAME="776"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And would you not say the same of Socrates sleeping 
<A NAME="778"></A>and waking, or in any of the states which we were mentioning?
<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I should.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> All agents have a different patient in Socrates, accordingly 
<A NAME="781"></A>as he is well or ill.
<A NAME="782"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="783"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And I who am the patient, and that which is the agent, 
<A NAME="784"></A>will produce something different in each of the two 
<A NAME="785"></A>cases?
<A NAME="786"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="787"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The wine which I drink when I am in health, appears 
<A NAME="788"></A>sweet and pleasant to me?
<A NAME="789"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> For, as has been already acknowledged, the patient 
<A NAME="791"></A>and agent meet together and produce sweetness and a perception of sweetness, 
<A NAME="792"></A>which are in simultaneous motion, and the perception which comes from the 
<A NAME="793"></A>patient makes the tongue percipient, and the quality of sweetness which 
<A NAME="794"></A>arises out of and is moving about the wine, makes the wine, both to be 
<A NAME="795"></A>and to appear sweet to the healthy tongue.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly; that has been already 
<A NAME="797"></A>acknowledged.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But when I am sick, the wine really acts upon another 
<A NAME="799"></A>and a different person?
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The combination of the draught of wine, and the Socrates 
<A NAME="802"></A>who is sick, produces quite another result; which is the sensation of bitterness 
<A NAME="803"></A>in the tongue, and the, motion and creation of bitterness in and about 
<A NAME="804"></A>the wine, which becomes not bitterness but something bitter; as I myself 
<A NAME="805"></A>become not but percipient?
<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="807"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> There is no, other object of which I shall ever have 
<A NAME="808"></A>the same perception, for another object would give another perception, 
<A NAME="809"></A>and would make the perception other and different; nor can that object 
<A NAME="810"></A>which affects me, meeting another, subject, produce, the same, or become 
<A NAME="811"></A>similar, for that too would produce another result from another subject, 
<A NAME="812"></A>and become different.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Neither can by myself, have this sensation, nor the 
<A NAME="815"></A>object by itself, this quality.
<A NAME="816"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> When I perceive I must become percipient of something-there 
<A NAME="818"></A>can be no such thing as perceiving and perceiving nothing; the object, 
<A NAME="819"></A>whether it become sweet, bitter, or of any other quality, must have relation 
<A NAME="820"></A>to a percipient; nothing can become sweet which is sweet to no 
<A NAME="821"></A>one.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="823"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then the inference is, that we [the agent and patient] 
<A NAME="824"></A>are or become in relation to one another; there is a law which binds us 
<A NAME="825"></A>one to the other, but not to any other existence, nor each of us to himself; 
<A NAME="826"></A>and therefore we can only be bound to one another; so that whether a person 
<A NAME="827"></A>says that a thing is or becomes, he must say that it is or becomes to or 
<A NAME="828"></A>of or in relation to something else; but he must not say or allow any one 
<A NAME="829"></A>else to say that anything is or becomes absolutely: -such is our 
<A NAME="830"></A>conclusion.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very true, Socrates.
<A NAME="832"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, if that which acts upon me has relation to me 
<A NAME="833"></A>and to no other, I and no other am the percipient of 
<A NAME="834"></A>it?
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then my perception is true to me, being inseparable 
<A NAME="837"></A>from my own being; and, as Protagoras says, to myself I am judge of what 
<A NAME="838"></A>is and-what is not to me.
<A NAME="839"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I suppose so.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> How then, if I never err, and if my mind never trips 
<A NAME="841"></A>in the conception of being or becoming, can I fail of knowing that which 
<A NAME="842"></A>I perceive?
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> You cannot.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then you were quite right in affirming that knowledge 
<A NAME="845"></A>is only perception; and the meaning turns out to be the same, whether with 
<A NAME="846"></A>Homer and Heracleitus, and all that company, you say that all is motion 
<A NAME="847"></A>and flux, or with the great sage Protagoras, that man is the measure of 
<A NAME="848"></A>all things; or with Theaetetus, that, given these premises, perception 
<A NAME="849"></A>is knowledge. Am I not right, Theaetetus, and is not this your newborn 
<A NAME="850"></A>child, of which I have delivered you? What say you?
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I cannot but agree, Socrates.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then this is the child, however he may turn out, which 
<A NAME="853"></A>you and I have with difficulty brought into the world. And now that he 
<A NAME="854"></A>is born, we must run round the hearth with him, and see whether he is worth 
<A NAME="855"></A>rearing, or is only a wind-egg and a sham. Is he to be reared in any case, 
<A NAME="856"></A>and not exposed? or will you bear to see him rejected, and not get into 
<A NAME="857"></A>a passion if I take away your first-born?
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> Theaetetus will not be angry, for he is very good-natured. 
<A NAME="859"></A>But tell me, Socrates, in heaven's name, is this, after all, not the 
<A NAME="860"></A>truth?
<A NAME="861"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You, Theodorus, are a lover of theories, and now you 
<A NAME="862"></A>innocently fancy that I am a bag full of them, and can easily pull one 
<A NAME="863"></A>out which will overthrow its predecessor. But you do not see that in reality 
<A NAME="864"></A>none of these theories come from me; they all come from him who talks with 
<A NAME="865"></A>me. I only know just enough to extract them from the wisdom of another, 
<A NAME="866"></A>and to receive them in a spirit of fairness. And now I shall say nothing 
<A NAME="867"></A>myself, but shall endeavour to elicit something from our young 
<A NAME="868"></A>friend.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> Do as you say, Socrates; you are quite 
<A NAME="870"></A>right.
<A NAME="871"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Shall I tell you, Theodorus, what amazes me in your 
<A NAME="872"></A>acquaintance Protagoras?
<A NAME="873"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I am charmed with his doctrine, that what appears is 
<A NAME="875"></A>to each one, but I wonder that he did not begin his book on Truth with 
<A NAME="876"></A>a declaration that a pig or a dog-faced baboon, or some other yet stranger 
<A NAME="877"></A>monster which has sensation, is the measure of all things; then he might 
<A NAME="878"></A>have shown a magnificent contempt for our opinion of him by informing us 
<A NAME="879"></A>at the outset that while we were reverencing him like a God for his wisdom 
<A NAME="880"></A>he was no better than a tadpole, not to speak of his fellow-men-would not 
<A NAME="881"></A>this have produced an over-powering effect? For if truth is only sensation, 
<A NAME="882"></A>and no man can discern another's feelings better than he, or has any superior 
<A NAME="883"></A>right to determine whether his opinion is true or false, but each, as we 
<A NAME="884"></A>have several times repeated, is to himself the sole judge, and everything 
<A NAME="885"></A>that he judges is true and right, why, my friend, should Protagoras be 
<A NAME="886"></A>preferred to the place of wisdom and instruction, and deserve to be well 
<A NAME="887"></A>paid, and we poor ignoramuses have to go to him, if each one is the measure 
<A NAME="888"></A>of his own wisdom? Must he not be talking ad captandum in all this? I say 
<A NAME="889"></A>nothing of the ridiculous predicament in which my own midwifery and the 
<A NAME="890"></A>whole art of dialectic is placed; for the attempt to supervise or refute 
<A NAME="891"></A>the notions or opinions of others would be a tedious and enormous piece 
<A NAME="892"></A>of folly, if to each man his own are right; and this must be the case if 
<A NAME="893"></A>Protagoras Truth is the real truth, and the philosopher is not merely amusing 
<A NAME="894"></A>himself by giving oracles out of the shrine of his book.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> He was a friend of mine, Socrates, as you were saying, 
<A NAME="896"></A>and therefore I cannot have him refuted by my lips, nor can I oppose you 
<A NAME="897"></A>when I agree with you; please, then, to take Theaetetus again; he seemed 
<A NAME="898"></A>to answer very nicely.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> If you were to go into a Lacedaemonian palestra, Theodorus, 
<A NAME="900"></A>would you have a right to look on at the naked wrestlers, some of them 
<A NAME="901"></A>making a poor figure, if you did not strip and give them an opportunity 
<A NAME="902"></A>of judging of your own person?
<A NAME="903"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> Why not, Socrates, if they would allow me, as I think 
<A NAME="904"></A>you will in consideration of my age and stiffness; let some more supple 
<A NAME="905"></A>youth try a fall with you, and do not drag me into the 
<A NAME="906"></A>gymnasium.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Your will is my will, Theodorus, as the proverbial 
<A NAME="908"></A>philosophers say, and therefore I will return to the sage Theaetetus: Tell 
<A NAME="909"></A>me, Theaetetus, in reference to what I was saying, are you not lost in 
<A NAME="910"></A>wonder, like myself, when you find that all of a sudden you are raised 
<A NAME="911"></A>to the level of the wisest of men, or indeed of the gods?-for you would 
<A NAME="912"></A>assume the measure of Protagoras to apply to the gods as well as 
<A NAME="913"></A>men?
<A NAME="914"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly I should, and I confess to you that I 
<A NAME="915"></A>am lost in wonder. At first hearing, I was quite satisfied with the doctrine, 
<A NAME="916"></A>that whatever appears is to each one, but now the face of things has 
<A NAME="917"></A>changed.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why, my dear boy, you are young, and therefore your 
<A NAME="919"></A>ear is quickly caught and your mind influenced by popular arguments. Protagoras, 
<A NAME="920"></A>or some one speaking on his behalf, will doubtless say in reply, good people, 
<A NAME="921"></A>young and old, you meet and harangue, and bring in the gods, whose existence 
<A NAME="922"></A>of non-existence I banish from writing and speech, or you talk about the 
<A NAME="923"></A>reason of man being degraded to the level of the brutes, which is a telling 
<A NAME="924"></A>argument with the multitude, but not one word of proof or demonstration 
<A NAME="925"></A>do you offer. All is probability with you, and yet surely you and Theodorus 
<A NAME="926"></A>had better reflect whether you are disposed to admit of probability and 
<A NAME="927"></A>figures of speech in matters of such importance. He or any other mathematician 
<A NAME="928"></A>who argued from probabilities and likelihoods in geometry, would not be 
<A NAME="929"></A>worth an ace.
<A NAME="930"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> But neither you nor we, Socrates, would be satisfied 
<A NAME="931"></A>with such arguments.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then you and Theodorus mean to say that we must look 
<A NAME="933"></A>at the matter in some other way?
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, in quite another way.
<A NAME="935"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the way will be to ask whether perception is or 
<A NAME="936"></A>is not the same as knowledge; for this was the real point of our argument, 
<A NAME="937"></A>and with a view to this we raised (did we not?) those many strange 
<A NAME="938"></A>questions.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Shall we say that we know every thing which we see 
<A NAME="941"></A>and hear? for example, shall we say that not having learned, we do not 
<A NAME="942"></A>hear the language of foreigners when they speak to us? or shall we say 
<A NAME="943"></A>that we not only hear, but know what they are saying? Or again, if we see 
<A NAME="944"></A>letters which we do not understand, shall we say that we do not see them? 
<A NAME="945"></A>or shall we aver that, seeing them, we must know them?
<A NAME="946"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> We shall say, Socrates, that we know what we actually 
<A NAME="947"></A>see and hear of them-that is to say, we see and know the figure and colour 
<A NAME="948"></A>of the letters, and we hear and know the elevation or depression of the 
<A NAME="949"></A>sound of them; but we do not perceive by sight and hearing, or know, that 
<A NAME="950"></A>which grammarians and interpreters teach about them.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Capital, Theaetetus; and about this there shall be 
<A NAME="952"></A>no dispute, because I want you to grow; but there is another difficulty 
<A NAME="953"></A>coming, which you will also have to repulse.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="955"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Some one will say, Can a man who has ever known anything, 
<A NAME="956"></A>and still has and preserves a memory of that which he knows, not know that 
<A NAME="957"></A>which he remembers at the time when he remembers? I have, I fear, a tedious 
<A NAME="958"></A>way of putting a simple question, which is only, whether a man who has 
<A NAME="959"></A>learned, and remembers, can fail to know?
<A NAME="960"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Impossible, Socrates; the supposition is 
<A NAME="961"></A>monstrous.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Am I talking nonsense, then? Think: is not seeing perceiving, 
<A NAME="963"></A>and is not sight perception?
<A NAME="964"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="965"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if our recent definition holds, every man knows 
<A NAME="966"></A>that which he has seen?
<A NAME="967"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="968"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And you would admit that there is such a thing as 
<A NAME="969"></A>memory?
<A NAME="970"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="971"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is memory of something or of 
<A NAME="972"></A>nothing?
<A NAME="973"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Of something, surely.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Of things learned and perceived, that 
<A NAME="975"></A>is?
<A NAME="976"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Often a man remembers that which he has 
<A NAME="978"></A>seen?
<A NAME="979"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="980"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if he closed his eyes, would he 
<A NAME="981"></A>forget?
<A NAME="982"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Who, Socrates, would dare to say 
<A NAME="983"></A>so?
<A NAME="984"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But we must say so, if the previous argument is to 
<A NAME="985"></A>be maintained.
<A NAME="986"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> What do you mean? I am not quite sure that I understand 
<A NAME="987"></A>you, though I have a strong suspicion that you are right.
<A NAME="988"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> As thus: he who sees knows, as we say, that which he 
<A NAME="989"></A>sees; for perception and sight and knowledge are admitted to be the 
<A NAME="990"></A>same.
<A NAME="991"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But he who saw, and has knowledge of that which he 
<A NAME="993"></A>saw, remembers, when he closes his eyes, that which he no longer 
<A NAME="994"></A>sees.
<A NAME="995"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="996"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And seeing is knowing, and therefore not-seeing is 
<A NAME="997"></A>not-knowing?
<A NAME="998"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then the inference is, that a man may have attained 
<A NAME="1000"></A>the knowledge, of something, which he may remember and yet not know, because 
<A NAME="1001"></A>he does not see; and this has been affirmed by us to be a monstrous 
<A NAME="1002"></A>supposition.
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Thus, then, the assertion that knowledge and perception 
<A NAME="1005"></A>are one, involves a manifest impossibility?
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then they must be distinguished?
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I suppose that they must.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Once more we shall have to begin, and ask "What is 
<A NAME="1010"></A>knowledge?" and yet, Theaetetus, what are we going to 
<A NAME="1011"></A>do?
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> About what?
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Like a good-for-nothing cock, without having won the 
<A NAME="1014"></A>victory, we walk away from the argument and crow.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> How do you mean?
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> After the manner of disputers, we were satisfied with 
<A NAME="1017"></A>mere verbal consistency, and were well pleased if in this way we could 
<A NAME="1018"></A>gain an advantage. Although professing not to be mere Eristics, but philosophers, 
<A NAME="1019"></A>I suspect that we have unconsciously fallen into the error of that ingenious 
<A NAME="1020"></A>class of persons.
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I do not as yet understand you.
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then I will try to explain myself: just now we asked 
<A NAME="1023"></A>the question, whether a man who had learned and remembered could fail to 
<A NAME="1024"></A>know, and we showed that a person who had seen might remember when he had 
<A NAME="1025"></A>his eyes shut and could not see, and then he would at the same time remember 
<A NAME="1026"></A>and not know. But this was an impossibility. And so the Protagorean fable 
<A NAME="1027"></A>came to nought, and yours also, who maintained that knowledge is the same 
<A NAME="1028"></A>as perception.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> True.
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And yet, my friend, I rather suspect that the result 
<A NAME="1031"></A>would have been different if Protagoras, who was the father of the first 
<A NAME="1032"></A>of the two-brats, had been alive; he would have had a great deal to say 
<A NAME="1033"></A>on their behalf. But he is dead, and we insult over his orphan child; and 
<A NAME="1034"></A>even the guardians whom he left, and of whom our friend Theodorus is one, 
<A NAME="1035"></A>are unwilling to give any help, and therefore I suppose that must take 
<A NAME="1036"></A>up his cause myself, and see justice done?
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> Not I, Socrates, but rather Callias, the son of Hipponicus, 
<A NAME="1038"></A>is guardian of his orphans. I was too soon diverted from the abstractions 
<A NAME="1039"></A>of dialectic to geometry. Nevertheless, I shall be grateful to you if you 
<A NAME="1040"></A>assist him.
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Very good, Theodorus; you shall see how I will come 
<A NAME="1042"></A>to the rescue. If a person does not attend to the meaning of terms as they 
<A NAME="1043"></A>are commonly used in argument, he may be involved even in greater paradoxes 
<A NAME="1044"></A>than these. Shall I explain this matter to you or to 
<A NAME="1045"></A>Theaetetus?
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> To both of us, and let the younger answer; he will 
<A NAME="1047"></A>incur less disgrace if he is discomfited.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then now let me ask the awful question, which is this:-Can 
<A NAME="1049"></A>a man know and also not know that which he knows?
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> How shall we answer, Theaetetus?
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> He cannot, I should say.
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> He can, if you maintain that seeing is knowing. When 
<A NAME="1053"></A>you are imprisoned in a well, as the saying is, and the self-assured adversary 
<A NAME="1054"></A>closes one of your eyes with his hand, and asks whether you can see his 
<A NAME="1055"></A>cloak with the eye which he has closed, how will you answer the inevitable 
<A NAME="1056"></A>man?
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> I should answer, "Not with that eye but with the 
<A NAME="1058"></A>other."
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then you see and do not see the same thing at the same 
<A NAME="1060"></A>time.
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, in a certain sense.
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> None of that, he will reply; I do not ask or bid you 
<A NAME="1063"></A>answer in what sense you know, but only whether you know that which you 
<A NAME="1064"></A>do not know. You have been proved to see that which you do not see; and 
<A NAME="1065"></A>you have already admitted that seeing is knowing, and that not-seeing is 
<A NAME="1066"></A>not-knowing: I leave you to draw the inference.
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> Yes, the inference is the contradictory of my 
<A NAME="1068"></A>assertion.
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, my marvel, and there might have been yet worse 
<A NAME="1070"></A>things in store for you, if an opponent had gone on to ask whether you 
<A NAME="1071"></A>can have a sharp and also a dull knowledge, and whether you can know near, 
<A NAME="1072"></A>but not at a distance, or know the same thing with more or less intensity, 
<A NAME="1073"></A>and so on without end. Such questions might have been put to you by a light-armed 
<A NAME="1074"></A>mercenary, who argued for pay. He would have lain in wait for you, and 
<A NAME="1075"></A>when you took up the position, that sense is knowledge, he would have made 
<A NAME="1076"></A>an assault upon hearing, smelling, and the other senses;-he would have 
<A NAME="1077"></A>shown you no mercy; and while you were lost in envy and admiration of his 
<A NAME="1078"></A>wisdom, he would have got you into his net, out of which you would not 
<A NAME="1079"></A>have escaped until you had come to an understanding about the sum to be 
<A NAME="1080"></A>paid for your release. Well, you ask, and how will Protagoras reinforce 
<A NAME="1081"></A>his position? Shall I answer for him?
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR><BR><B>Theaet.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> He will repeat all those things which we have been 
<A NAME="1084"></A>urging on his behalf, and then he will close with us in disdain, and say:-The 
<A NAME="1085"></A>worthy Socrates asked a little boy, whether the same man could remember 
<A NAME="1086"></A>and not know the same thing, and the boy said No, because he was frightened, 
<A NAME="1087"></A>and could not see what was coming, and then Socrates made fun of poor me. 
<A NAME="1088"></A>The truth is, O slatternly Socrates, that when you ask questions about 
<A NAME="1089"></A>any assertion of mine, and the person asked is found tripping, if he has 
<A NAME="1090"></A>answered as I should have answered, then I am refuted, but if he answers 
<A NAME="1091"></A>something else, then he is refuted and not I. For do you really suppose 
<A NAME="1092"></A>that any one would admit the memory which a man has of an impression which 
<A NAME="1093"></A>has passed away to be the same with that which he experienced at the time? 
<A NAME="1094"></A>Assuredly not. Or would he hesitate to acknowledge that the same man may 
<A NAME="1095"></A>know and not know the same thing? Or, if he is afraid of making this admission, 
<A NAME="1096"></A>would he ever grant that one who has become unlike is the same as before 
<A NAME="1097"></A>he became unlike? Or would he admit that a man is one at all, and not rather 
<A NAME="1098"></A>many and infinite as the changes which take place in him? I speak by the 
<A NAME="1099"></A>card in order to avoid entanglements of words. But, O my good sir, he would 
<A NAME="1100"></A>say, come to the argument in a more generous spirit; and either show, if 
<A NAME="1101"></A>you can, that our sensations are not relative and individual, or, if you 
<A NAME="1102"></A>admit them to be so, prove that this does not involve the consequence that 
<A NAME="1103"></A>the appearance becomes, or, if you will have the word, is, to the individual 
<A NAME="1104"></A>only. As to your talk about pigs and baboons, you are yourself behaving 
<A NAME="1105"></A>like a pig, and you teach your hearers to make sport of my writings in 
<A NAME="1106"></A>the same ignorant manner; but this is not to your credit. For I declare 
<A NAME="1107"></A>that the truth is as I have written, and that each of us is a measure of 
<A NAME="1108"></A>existence and of non-existence. Yet one man may be a thousand times better 
<A NAME="1109"></A>than another in proportion as different things are and appear to 
<A NAME="1110"></A>him.
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR><BR>And I am far from saying that wisdom and the wise man have no existence; 
<A NAME="1112"></A>but I say that the wise man is he who makes the evils which appear and 
<A NAME="1113"></A>are to a man, into goods which are and appear to him. And I would beg you 
<A NAME="1114"></A>not to my words in the letter, but to take the meaning of them as I will 
<A NAME="1115"></A>explain them. Remember what has been already said,-that to the sick man 
<A NAME="1116"></A>his food appears to be and is bitter, and to the man in health the opposite 
<A NAME="1117"></A>of bitter. Now I cannot conceive that one of these men can be or ought 
<A NAME="1118"></A>to be made wiser than the other: nor can you assert that the sick man because 
<A NAME="1119"></A>he has one impression is foolish, and the healthy man because he has another 
<A NAME="1120"></A>is wise; but the one state requires to be changed into the other, the worse 
<A NAME="1121"></A>into the better. As in education, a change of state has to be effected, 
<A NAME="1122"></A>and the sophist accomplishes by words the change which the physician works 
<A NAME="1123"></A>by the aid of drugs. Not that any one ever made another think truly, who 
<A NAME="1124"></A>previously thought falsely. For no one can think what is not, or think 
<A NAME="1125"></A>anything different from that which he feels; and this is always true. But 
<A NAME="1126"></A>as the inferior habit of mind has thoughts of kindred nature, so I conceive 
<A NAME="1127"></A>that a good mind causes men to have good thoughts; and these which the 
<A NAME="1128"></A>inexperienced call true, I maintain to be only better, and not truer than 
<A NAME="1129"></A>others. And, O my dear Socrates, I do not call wise men tadpoles: far from 
<A NAME="1130"></A>it; I say that they are the physicians of the human body, and the husbandmen 
<A NAME="1131"></A>of plants-for the husbandmen also take away the evil and disordered sensations 
<A NAME="1132"></A>of plants, and infuse into them good and healthy sensations-aye and true 
<A NAME="1133"></A>ones; and the wise and good rhetoricians make the good instead of the evil 
<A NAME="1134"></A>to seem just to states; for whatever appears to a state to be just and 
<A NAME="1135"></A>fair, so long as it is regarded as such, is just and fair to it; but the 
<A NAME="1136"></A>teacher of wisdom causes the good to take the place of the evil, both in 
<A NAME="1137"></A>appearance and in reality. And in like manner the Sophist who is able to 
<A NAME="1138"></A>train his pupils in this spirit is a wise man, and deserves to be well 
<A NAME="1139"></A>paid by them. And so one man is wiser than another; and no one thinks falsely, 
<A NAME="1140"></A>and you, whether you will or not, must endure to be a measure. On these 
<A NAME="1141"></A>foundations the argument stands firm, which you, Socrates, may, if you 
<A NAME="1142"></A>please, overthrow by an opposite argument, or if you like you may put questions 
<A NAME="1143"></A>to me-a method to which no intelligent person will object, quite the reverse. 
<A NAME="1144"></A>But I must beg you to put fair questions: for there is great inconsistency 
<A NAME="1145"></A>in saying that you have a zeal for virtue, and then always behaving unfairly 
<A NAME="1146"></A>in argument. The unfairness of which I complain is that you do not distinguish 
<A NAME="1147"></A>between mere disputation and dialectic: the disputer may trip up his opponent 
<A NAME="1148"></A>as often as he likes, and make fun; but the dialectician will be in earnest, 
<A NAME="1149"></A>and only correct his adversary when necessary, telling him the errors into 
<A NAME="1150"></A>which he has fallen through his own fault, or that of the company which 
<A NAME="1151"></A>he has previously kept. If you do so, your adversary will lay the blame 
<A NAME="1152"></A>of his own confusion and perplexity on himself, and not on you; will follow 
<A NAME="1153"></A>and love you, and will hate himself, and escape from himself into philosophy, 
<A NAME="1154"></A>in order that he may become different from what he was. But the other mode 
<A NAME="1155"></A>of arguing, which is practised by the many, will have just the opposite 
<A NAME="1156"></A>effect upon him; and as he grows older, instead of turning philosopher, 
<A NAME="1157"></A>he will come to hate philosophy. I would recommend you, therefore, as I 
<A NAME="1158"></A>said before, not to encourage yourself in this polemical and controversial 
<A NAME="1159"></A>temper, but to find out, in a friendly and congenial spirit, what we really 
<A NAME="1160"></A>mean when we say that all things are in motion, and that to every individual 
<A NAME="1161"></A>and state what appears, is. In this manner you will consider whether knowledge 
<A NAME="1162"></A>and sensation are the same or different, but you will not argue, as you 
<A NAME="1163"></A>were just now doing, from the customary use of names and words, which the 
<A NAME="1164"></A>vulgar pervert in all sorts of ways, causing infinite perplexity to one 
<A NAME="1165"></A>another. Such, Theodorus, is the very slight help which I am able to offer 
<A NAME="1166"></A>to your old friend; had he been living, he would have helped himself in 
<A NAME="1167"></A>a far more gloriose style.
<A NAME="1168"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> You are jesting, Socrates; indeed, your defence of 
<A NAME="1169"></A>him has been most valorous.
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Thank you, friend; and I hope that you observed Protagoras 
<A NAME="1171"></A>bidding us be serious, as the text, "Man is the measure of all things," 
<A NAME="1172"></A>was a solemn one; and he reproached us with making a boy the medium of 
<A NAME="1173"></A>discourse, and said that the boy's timidity was made to tell against his 
<A NAME="1174"></A>argument; he also declared that we made a joke of him.
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> How could I fail to observe all that, 
<A NAME="1176"></A>Socrates?
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, and shall we do as he says?
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But if his wishes are to be regarded, you and I must 
<A NAME="1180"></A>take up the argument, and in all seriousness, and ask and answer one another, 
<A NAME="1181"></A>for you see that the rest of us are nothing but boys. In no other way can 
<A NAME="1182"></A>we escape the imputation, that in our fresh analysis of his thesis we are 
<A NAME="1183"></A>making fun with boys.
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> Well, but is not Theaetetus better able to follow 
<A NAME="1185"></A>a philosophical enquiry than a great many men who have long 
<A NAME="1186"></A>beards?
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, Theodorus, but not better than you; and therefore 
<A NAME="1188"></A>please not to imagine that I am to defend by every means in my power your 
<A NAME="1189"></A>departed friend; and that you are to defend nothing and nobody. At any 
<A NAME="1190"></A>rate, my good man, do not sheer off until we know whether you are a true 
<A NAME="1191"></A>measure of diagrams, or whether all men are equally measures and sufficient 
<A NAME="1192"></A>for themselves in astronomy and geometry, and the other branches of knowledge 
<A NAME="1193"></A>in which you are supposed to excel them.
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> He who is sitting by you, Socrates, will not easily 
<A NAME="1195"></A>avoid being drawn into an argument; and when I said just now that you would 
<A NAME="1196"></A>excuse me, and not, like the Lacedaemonians, compel me to strip and fight, 
<A NAME="1197"></A>I was talking nonsense-I should rather compare you to Scirrhon, who threw 
<A NAME="1198"></A>travellers from the rocks; for the Lacedaemonian rule is "strip or depart," 
<A NAME="1199"></A>but you seem to go about your work more after the fashion of Antaeus: you 
<A NAME="1200"></A>will not allow any one who approaches you to depart until you have stripped 
<A NAME="1201"></A>him, and he has been compelled to try a fall with you in 
<A NAME="1202"></A>argument.
<A NAME="1203"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> There, Theodorus, you have hit off precisely the nature 
<A NAME="1204"></A>of my complaint; but I am even more pugnacious than the giants of old, 
<A NAME="1205"></A>for I have met with no end of heroes; many a Heracles, many a Theseus, 
<A NAME="1206"></A>mighty in words, has broken my head; nevertheless I am always at this rough 
<A NAME="1207"></A>exercise, which inspires me like a passion. Please, then, to try a fall 
<A NAME="1208"></A>with me, whereby you will do yourself good as well as 
<A NAME="1209"></A>me.
<A NAME="1210"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> I consent; lead me whither you will, for I know that 
<A NAME="1211"></A>you are like destiny; no man can escape from any argument which you may 
<A NAME="1212"></A>weave for him. But I am not disposed to go further than you 
<A NAME="1213"></A>suggest.
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Once will be enough; and now take particular care that 
<A NAME="1215"></A>we do not again unwittingly expose ourselves to the reproach of talking 
<A NAME="1216"></A>childishly.
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> I will do my best to avoid that 
<A NAME="1218"></A>error.
<A NAME="1219"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> In the first place, let us return to our old objection, 
<A NAME="1220"></A>and see whether we were right in blaming and taking offence at Protagoras 
<A NAME="1221"></A>on the ground that he assumed all to be equal and sufficient in wisdom; 
<A NAME="1222"></A>although he admitted that there was a better and worse, and that in respect 
<A NAME="1223"></A>of this, some who as he said were the wise excelled 
<A NAME="1224"></A>others.
<A NAME="1225"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="1226"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Had Protagoras been living and answered for himself, 
<A NAME="1227"></A>instead of our answering for him, there would have been no need of our 
<A NAME="1228"></A>reviewing or reinforcing the argument. But as he is not here, and some 
<A NAME="1229"></A>one may accuse us of speaking without authority on his behalf, had we not 
<A NAME="1230"></A>better come to a clearer agreement about his meaning, for a great deal 
<A NAME="1231"></A>may be at stake?
<A NAME="1232"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> True.
<A NAME="1233"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then let us obtain, not through any third person, but 
<A NAME="1234"></A>from his own statement and in the fewest words possible, the basis of 
<A NAME="1235"></A>agreement.
<A NAME="1236"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> In what way?
<A NAME="1237"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> In this way:-His words are, "What seems to a man, is 
<A NAME="1238"></A>to him."
<A NAME="1239"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> Yes, so he says.
<A NAME="1240"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And are not we, Protagoras, uttering the opinion of 
<A NAME="1241"></A>man, or rather of all mankind, when we say that every one thinks himself 
<A NAME="1242"></A>wiser than other men in some things, and their inferior in others? In the 
<A NAME="1243"></A>hour of danger, when they are in perils of war, or of the sea, or of sickness, 
<A NAME="1244"></A>do they not look up to their commanders as if they were gods, and expect 
<A NAME="1245"></A>salvation from them, only because they excel them in knowledge? Is not 
<A NAME="1246"></A>the world full of men in their several employments, who are looking for 
<A NAME="1247"></A>teachers and rulers of themselves and of the animals? and there are plenty 
<A NAME="1248"></A>who think that they are able to teach and able to rule. Now, in all this 
<A NAME="1249"></A>is implied that ignorance and wisdom exist among them, least in their own 
<A NAME="1250"></A>opinion.
<A NAME="1251"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> Certain
