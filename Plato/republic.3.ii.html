<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Socrates - GLAUCON
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>With these words I was thinking that I had made an end of the discussion; 
<A NAME="12"></A>but the end, in truth, proved to be only a beginning. For Glaucon, who 
<A NAME="13"></A>is always the most pugnacious of men, was dissatisfied at Thrasymachus' 
<A NAME="14"></A>retirement; he wanted to have the battle out. So he said to me: Socrates, 
<A NAME="15"></A>do you wish really to persuade us, or only to seem to have persuaded us, 
<A NAME="16"></A>that to be just is always better than to be unjust?
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>I should wish really to persuade you, I replied, if I 
<A NAME="18"></A>could.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Then you certainly have not succeeded. Let me ask you now: --How would 
<A NAME="20"></A>you arrange goods --are there not some which we welcome for their own sakes, 
<A NAME="21"></A>and independently of their consequences, as, for example, harmless pleasures 
<A NAME="22"></A>and enjoyments, which delight us at the time, although nothing follows 
<A NAME="23"></A>from them?
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>I agree in thinking that there is such a class, I 
<A NAME="25"></A>replied.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Is there not also a second class of goods, such as knowledge, sight, 
<A NAME="27"></A>health, which are desirable not only in themselves, but also for their 
<A NAME="28"></A>results?
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, I said.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>And would you not recognize a third class, such as gymnastic, and the 
<A NAME="31"></A>care of the sick, and the physician's art; also the various ways of money-making 
<A NAME="32"></A>--these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable; and no one would 
<A NAME="33"></A>choose them for their own sakes, but only for the sake of some reward or 
<A NAME="34"></A>result which flows from them?
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>There is, I said, this third class also. But why do you 
<A NAME="36"></A>ask?
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Because I want to know in which of the three classes you would place 
<A NAME="38"></A>justice?
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>In the highest class, I replied, --among those goods which he who 
<A NAME="40"></A>would be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their 
<A NAME="41"></A>results.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>Then the many are of another mind; they think that justice is to 
<A NAME="43"></A>be reckoned in the troublesome class, among goods which are to be pursued 
<A NAME="44"></A>for the sake of rewards and of reputation, but in themselves are disagreeable 
<A NAME="45"></A>and rather to be avoided.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>I know, I said, that this is their manner of thinking, and that 
<A NAME="47"></A>this was the thesis which Thrasymachus was maintaining just now, when he 
<A NAME="48"></A>censured justice and praised injustice. But I am too stupid to be convinced 
<A NAME="49"></A>by him.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>I wish, he said, that you would hear me as well as him, and then 
<A NAME="51"></A>I shall see whether you and I agree. For Thrasymachus seems to me, like 
<A NAME="52"></A>a snake, to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have 
<A NAME="53"></A>been; but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet been 
<A NAME="54"></A>made clear. Setting aside their rewards and results, I want to know what 
<A NAME="55"></A>they are in themselves, and how they inwardly work in the soul. If you, 
<A NAME="56"></A>please, then, I will revive the argument of Thrasymachus. And first I will 
<A NAME="57"></A>speak of the nature and origin of justice according to the common view 
<A NAME="58"></A>of them. Secondly, I will show that all men who practise justice do so 
<A NAME="59"></A>against their will, of necessity, but not as a good. And thirdly, I will 
<A NAME="60"></A>argue that there is reason in this view, for the life of the unjust is 
<A NAME="61"></A>after all better far than the life of the just --if what they say is true, 
<A NAME="62"></A>Socrates, since I myself am not of their opinion. But still I acknowledge 
<A NAME="63"></A>that I am perplexed when I hear the voices of Thrasymachus and myriads 
<A NAME="64"></A>of others dinning in my ears; and, on the other hand, I have never yet 
<A NAME="65"></A>heard the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by any one in 
<A NAME="66"></A>a satisfactory way. I want to hear justice praised in respect of itself; 
<A NAME="67"></A>then I shall be satisfied, and you are the person from whom I think that 
<A NAME="68"></A>I am most likely to hear this; and therefore I will praise the unjust life 
<A NAME="69"></A>to the utmost of my power, and my manner of speaking will indicate the 
<A NAME="70"></A>manner in which I desire to hear you too praising justice and censuring 
<A NAME="71"></A>injustice. Will you say whether you approve of my proposal?
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>Indeed I do; nor can I imagine any theme about which a man of sense 
<A NAME="73"></A>would oftener wish to converse.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>I am delighted, he replied, to hear you say so, and shall begin 
<A NAME="75"></A>by speaking, as I proposed, of the nature and origin of 
<A NAME="76"></A>justice.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>Glaucon
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>They say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice, 
<A NAME="79"></A>evil; but that the evil is greater than the good. And so when men have 
<A NAME="80"></A>both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both, not being 
<A NAME="81"></A>able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they had better 
<A NAME="82"></A>agree among themselves to have neither; hence there arise laws and mutual 
<A NAME="83"></A>covenants; and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and 
<A NAME="84"></A>just. This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice; --it is 
<A NAME="85"></A>a mean or compromise, between the best of all, which is to do injustice 
<A NAME="86"></A>and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is to suffer injustice 
<A NAME="87"></A>without the power of retaliation; and justice, being at a middle point 
<A NAME="88"></A>between the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as the lesser evil, and 
<A NAME="89"></A>honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice. For no man 
<A NAME="90"></A>who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement 
<A NAME="91"></A>if he were able to resist; he would be mad if he did. Such is the received 
<A NAME="92"></A>account, Socrates, of the nature and origin of justice.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>Now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because 
<A NAME="94"></A>they have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine something 
<A NAME="95"></A>of this kind: having given both to the just and the unjust power to do 
<A NAME="96"></A>what they will, let us watch and see whither desire will lead them; then 
<A NAME="97"></A>we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be proceeding 
<A NAME="98"></A>along the same road, following their interest, which all natures deem to 
<A NAME="99"></A>be their good, and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force 
<A NAME="100"></A>of law. The liberty which we are supposing may be most completely given 
<A NAME="101"></A>to them in the form of such a power as is said to have been possessed by 
<A NAME="102"></A>Gyges the ancestor of Croesus the Lydian. According to the tradition, Gyges 
<A NAME="103"></A>was a shepherd in the service of the king of Lydia; there was a great storm, 
<A NAME="104"></A>and an earthquake made an opening in the earth at the place where he was 
<A NAME="105"></A>feeding his flock. Amazed at the sight, he descended into the opening, 
<A NAME="106"></A>where, among other marvels, he beheld a hollow brazen horse, having doors, 
<A NAME="107"></A>at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature, as appeared 
<A NAME="108"></A>to him, more than human, and having nothing on but a gold ring; this he 
<A NAME="109"></A>took from the finger of the dead and reascended. Now the shepherds met 
<A NAME="110"></A>together, according to custom, that they might send their monthly report 
<A NAME="111"></A>about the flocks to the king; into their assembly he came having the ring 
<A NAME="112"></A>on his finger, and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the 
<A NAME="113"></A>collet of the ring inside his hand, when instantly he became invisible 
<A NAME="114"></A>to the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were 
<A NAME="115"></A>no longer present. He was astonished at this, and again touching the ring 
<A NAME="116"></A>he turned the collet outwards and reappeared; he made several trials of 
<A NAME="117"></A>the ring, and always with the same result-when he turned the collet inwards 
<A NAME="118"></A>he became invisible, when outwards he reappeared. Whereupon he contrived 
<A NAME="119"></A>to be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court; where as 
<A NAME="120"></A>soon as he arrived he seduced the queen, and with her help conspired against 
<A NAME="121"></A>the king and slew him, and took the kingdom. Suppose now that there were 
<A NAME="122"></A>two such magic rings, and the just put on one of them and the unjust the 
<A NAME="123"></A>other;,no man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would 
<A NAME="124"></A>stand fast in justice. No man would keep his hands off what was not his 
<A NAME="125"></A>own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market, or go into 
<A NAME="126"></A>houses and lie with any one at his pleasure, or kill or release from prison 
<A NAME="127"></A>whom he would, and in all respects be like a God among men. Then the actions 
<A NAME="128"></A>of the just would be as the actions of the unjust; they would both come 
<A NAME="129"></A>at last to the same point. And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof 
<A NAME="130"></A>that a man is just, not willingly or because he thinks that justice is 
<A NAME="131"></A>any good to him individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks 
<A NAME="132"></A>that he can safely be unjust, there he is unjust. For all men believe in 
<A NAME="133"></A>their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than 
<A NAME="134"></A>justice, and he who argues as I have been supposing, will say that they 
<A NAME="135"></A>are right. If you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming 
<A NAME="136"></A>invisible, and never doing any wrong or touching what was another's, he 
<A NAME="137"></A>would be thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although 
<A NAME="138"></A>they would praise him to one another's faces, and keep up appearances with 
<A NAME="139"></A>one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice. Enough of 
<A NAME="140"></A>this.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>Now, if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just 
<A NAME="142"></A>and unjust, we must isolate them; there is no other way; and how is the 
<A NAME="143"></A>isolation to be effected? I answer: Let the unjust man be entirely unjust, 
<A NAME="144"></A>and the just man entirely just; nothing is to be taken away from either 
<A NAME="145"></A>of them, and both are to be perfectly furnished for the work of their respective 
<A NAME="146"></A>lives. First, let the unjust be like other distinguished masters of craft; 
<A NAME="147"></A>like the skilful pilot or physician, who knows intuitively his own powers 
<A NAME="148"></A>and keeps within their limits, and who, if he fails at any point, is able 
<A NAME="149"></A>to recover himself. So let the unjust make his unjust attempts in the right 
<A NAME="150"></A>way, and lie hidden if he means to be great in his injustice (he who is 
<A NAME="151"></A>found out is nobody): for the highest reach of injustice is: to be deemed 
<A NAME="152"></A>just when you are not. Therefore I say that in the perfectly unjust man 
<A NAME="153"></A>we must assume the most perfect injustice; there is to be no deduction, 
<A NAME="154"></A>but we must allow him, while doing the most unjust acts, to have acquired 
<A NAME="155"></A>the greatest reputation for justice. If he have taken a false step he must 
<A NAME="156"></A>be able to recover himself; he must be one who can speak with effect, if 
<A NAME="157"></A>any of his deeds come to light, and who can force his way where force is 
<A NAME="158"></A>required his courage and strength, and command of money and friends. And 
<A NAME="159"></A>at his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and simplicity, 
<A NAME="160"></A>wishing, as Aeschylus says, to be and not to seem good. There must be no 
<A NAME="161"></A>seeming, for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded, and 
<A NAME="162"></A>then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or for 
<A NAME="163"></A>the sake of honours and rewards; therefore, let him be clothed in justice 
<A NAME="164"></A>only, and have no other covering; and he must be imagined in a state of 
<A NAME="165"></A>life the opposite of the former. Let him be the best of men, and let him 
<A NAME="166"></A>be thought the worst; then he will have been put to the proof; and we shall 
<A NAME="167"></A>see whether he will be affected by the fear of infamy and its consequences. 
<A NAME="168"></A>And let him continue thus to the hour of death; being just and seeming 
<A NAME="169"></A>to be unjust. When both have reached the uttermost extreme, the one of 
<A NAME="170"></A>justice and the other of injustice, let judgment be given which of them 
<A NAME="171"></A>is the happier of the two.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Socrates - GLAUCON
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>Heavens! my dear Glaucon, I said, how energetically you polish 
<A NAME="174"></A>them up for the decision, first one and then the other, as if they were 
<A NAME="175"></A>two statues.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>I do my best, he said. And now that we know what they are like 
<A NAME="177"></A>there is no difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either 
<A NAME="178"></A>of them. This I will proceed to describe; but as you may think the description 
<A NAME="179"></A>a little too coarse, I ask you to suppose, Socrates, that the words which 
<A NAME="180"></A>follow are not mine. --Let me put them into the mouths of the eulogists 
<A NAME="181"></A>of injustice: They will tell you that the just man who is thought unjust 
<A NAME="182"></A>will be scourged, racked, bound --will have his eyes burnt out; and, at 
<A NAME="183"></A>last, after suffering every kind of evil, he will be impaled: Then he will 
<A NAME="184"></A>understand that he ought to seem only, and not to be, just; the words of 
<A NAME="185"></A>Aeschylus may be more truly spoken of the unjust than of the just. For 
<A NAME="186"></A>the unjust is pursuing a reality; he does not live with a view to appearances 
<A NAME="187"></A>--he wants to be really unjust and not to seem only:--
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>His mind has a soil deep and fertile,
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Out of which spring his prudent counsels. In the first place, he is 
<A NAME="190"></A>thought just, and therefore bears rule in the city; he can marry whom he 
<A NAME="191"></A>will, and give in marriage to whom he will; also he can trade and deal 
<A NAME="192"></A>where he likes, and always to his own advantage, because he has no misgivings 
<A NAME="193"></A>about injustice and at every contest, whether in public or private, he 
<A NAME="194"></A>gets the better of his antagonists, and gains at their expense, and is 
<A NAME="195"></A>rich, and out of his gains he can benefit his friends, and harm his enemies; 
<A NAME="196"></A>moreover, he can offer sacrifices, and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly 
<A NAME="197"></A>and magnificently, and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to 
<A NAME="198"></A>honour in a far better style than the just, and therefore he is likely 
<A NAME="199"></A>to be dearer than they are to the gods. And thus, Socrates, gods and men 
<A NAME="200"></A>are said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the life 
<A NAME="201"></A>of the just.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>Adeimantus -SOCRATES
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>I was going to say something in answer to Glaucon, when Adeimantus, 
<A NAME="204"></A>his brother, interposed: Socrates, he said, you do not suppose that there 
<A NAME="205"></A>is nothing more to be urged?
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>Why, what else is there? I answered.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>The strongest point of all has not been even mentioned, he 
<A NAME="208"></A>replied.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Well, then, according to the proverb, 'Let brother help brother' --if 
<A NAME="210"></A>he fails in any part do you assist him; although I must confess that Glaucon 
<A NAME="211"></A>has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust, and take from me the 
<A NAME="212"></A>power of helping justice.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>Adeimantus
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>Nonsense, he replied. But let me add something more: There is another 
<A NAME="215"></A>side to Glaucon's argument about the praise and censure of justice and 
<A NAME="216"></A>injustice, which is equally required in order to bring out what I believe 
<A NAME="217"></A>to be his meaning. Parents and tutors are always telling their sons and 
<A NAME="218"></A>their wards that they are to be just; but why? not for the sake of justice, 
<A NAME="219"></A>but for the sake of character and reputation; in the hope of obtaining 
<A NAME="220"></A>for him who is reputed just some of those offices, marriages, and the like 
<A NAME="221"></A>which Glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing to the unjust 
<A NAME="222"></A>from the reputation of justice. More, however, is made of appearances by 
<A NAME="223"></A>this class of persons than by the others; for they throw in the good opinion 
<A NAME="224"></A>of the gods, and will tell you of a shower of benefits which the heavens, 
<A NAME="225"></A>as they say, rain upon the pious; and this accords with the testimony of 
<A NAME="226"></A>the noble Hesiod and Homer, the first of whom says, that the gods make 
<A NAME="227"></A>the oaks of the just--
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>To hear acorns at their summit, and bees I the 
<A NAME="229"></A>middle;
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>And the sheep the bowed down bowed the with the their fleeces. and 
<A NAME="231"></A>many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them. And Homer has 
<A NAME="232"></A>a very similar strain; for he speaks of one whose fame 
<A NAME="233"></A>is--
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>As the fame of some blameless king who, like a 
<A NAME="235"></A>god,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Maintains justice to whom the black earth brings 
<A NAME="237"></A>forth
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Wheat and barley, whose trees are bowed with fruit,
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>And his sheep never fail to bear, and the sea gives him fish. Still 
<A NAME="240"></A>grander are the gifts of heaven which Musaeus and his son vouchsafe to 
<A NAME="241"></A>the just; they take them down into the world below, where they have the 
<A NAME="242"></A>saints lying on couches at a feast, everlastingly drunk, crowned with garlands; 
<A NAME="243"></A>their idea seems to be that an immortality of drunkenness is the highest 
<A NAME="244"></A>meed of virtue. Some extend their rewards yet further; the posterity, as 
<A NAME="245"></A>they say, of the faithful and just shall survive to the third and fourth 
<A NAME="246"></A>generation. This is the style in which they praise justice. But about the 
<A NAME="247"></A>wicked there is another strain; they bury them in a slough in Hades, and 
<A NAME="248"></A>make them carry water in a sieve; also while they are yet living they bring 
<A NAME="249"></A>them to infamy, and inflict upon them the punishments which Glaucon described 
<A NAME="250"></A>as the portion of the just who are reputed to be unjust; nothing else does 
<A NAME="251"></A>their invention supply. Such is their manner of praising the one and censuring 
<A NAME="252"></A>the other.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>Once more, Socrates, I will ask you to consider another way of 
<A NAME="254"></A>speaking about justice and injustice, which is not confined to the poets, 
<A NAME="255"></A>but is found in prose writers. The universal voice of mankind is always 
<A NAME="256"></A>declaring that justice and virtue are honourable, but grievous and toilsome; 
<A NAME="257"></A>and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of attainment, and 
<A NAME="258"></A>are only censured by law and opinion. They say also that honesty is for 
<A NAME="259"></A>the most part less profitable than dishonesty; and they are quite ready 
<A NAME="260"></A>to call wicked men happy, and to honour them both in public and private 
<A NAME="261"></A>when they are rich or in any other way influential, while they despise 
<A NAME="262"></A>and overlook those who may be weak and poor, even though acknowledging 
<A NAME="263"></A>them to be better than the others. But most extraordinary of all is their 
<A NAME="264"></A>mode of speaking about virtue and the gods: they say that the gods apportion 
<A NAME="265"></A>calamity and misery to many good men, and good and happiness to the wicked. 
<A NAME="266"></A>And mendicant prophets go to rich men's doors and persuade them that they 
<A NAME="267"></A>have a power committed to them by the gods of making an atonement for a 
<A NAME="268"></A>man's own or his ancestor's sins by sacrifices or charms, with rejoicings 
<A NAME="269"></A>and feasts; and they promise to harm an enemy, whether just or unjust, 
<A NAME="270"></A>at a small cost; with magic arts and incantations binding heaven, as they 
<A NAME="271"></A>say, to execute their will. And the poets are the authorities to whom they 
<A NAME="272"></A>appeal, now smoothing the path of vice with the words of Hesiod; 
<A NAME="273"></A>--
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>Vice may be had in abundance without trouble; the way is smooth 
<A NAME="275"></A>and her dwelling-place is near. But before virtue the gods have set toil, 
<A NAME="276"></A>and a tedious and uphill road: then citing Homer as a witness that the 
<A NAME="277"></A>gods may be influenced by men; for he also says:
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>The gods, too, may he turned from their purpose; and men pray to 
<A NAME="279"></A>them and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties, and by 
<A NAME="280"></A>libations and the odour of fat, when they have sinned and transgressed. 
<A NAME="281"></A>And they produce a host of books written by Musaeus and Orpheus, who were 
<A NAME="282"></A>children of the Moon and the Muses --that is what they say --according 
<A NAME="283"></A>to which they perform their ritual, and persuade not only individuals, 
<A NAME="284"></A>but whole cities, that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by 
<A NAME="285"></A>sacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour, and are equally at 
<A NAME="286"></A>the service of the living and the dead; the latter sort they call mysteries, 
<A NAME="287"></A>and they redeem us from the pains of hell, but if we neglect them no one 
<A NAME="288"></A>knows what awaits us.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>He proceeded: And now when the young hear all this said about virtue 
<A NAME="290"></A>and vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their 
<A NAME="291"></A>minds likely to be affected, my dear Socrates, --those of them, I mean, 
<A NAME="292"></A>who are quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower, 
<A NAME="293"></A>and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner 
<A NAME="294"></A>of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would 
<A NAME="295"></A>make the best of life? Probably the youth will say to himself in the words 
<A NAME="296"></A>of Pindar--
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>Can I by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier 
<A NAME="298"></A>tower which may he a fortress to me all my days? For what men say is that, 
<A NAME="299"></A>if I am really just and am not also thought just profit there is none, 
<A NAME="300"></A>but the pain and loss on the other hand are unmistakable. But if, though 
<A NAME="301"></A>unjust, I acquire the reputation of justice, a heavenly life is promised 
<A NAME="302"></A>to me. Since then, as philosophers prove, appearance tyrannizes over truth 
<A NAME="303"></A>and is lord of happiness, to appearance I must devote myself. I will describe 
<A NAME="304"></A>around me a picture and shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior 
<A NAME="305"></A>of my house; behind I will trail the subtle and crafty fox, as Archilochus, 
<A NAME="306"></A>greatest of sages, recommends. But I hear some one exclaiming that the 
<A NAME="307"></A>concealment of wickedness is often difficult; to which I answer, Nothing 
<A NAME="308"></A>great is easy. Nevertheless, the argument indicates this, if we would be 
<A NAME="309"></A>happy, to be the path along which we should proceed. With a view to concealment 
<A NAME="310"></A>we will establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs. And there are 
<A NAME="311"></A>professors of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and assemblies; 
<A NAME="312"></A>and so, partly by persuasion and partly by force, I shall make unlawful 
<A NAME="313"></A>gains and not be punished. Still I hear a voice saying that the gods cannot 
<A NAME="314"></A>be deceived, neither can they be compelled. But what if there are no gods? 
<A NAME="315"></A>or, suppose them to have no care of human things --why in either case should 
<A NAME="316"></A>we mind about concealment? And even if there are gods, and they do care 
<A NAME="317"></A>about us, yet we know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of 
<A NAME="318"></A>the poets; and these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced 
<A NAME="319"></A>and turned by 'sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings.' Let 
<A NAME="320"></A>us be consistent then, and believe both or neither. If the poets speak 
<A NAME="321"></A>truly, why then we had better be unjust, and offer of the fruits of injustice; 
<A NAME="322"></A>for if we are just, although we may escape the vengeance of heaven, we 
<A NAME="323"></A>shall lose the gains of injustice; but, if we are unjust, we shall keep 
<A NAME="324"></A>the gains, and by our sinning and praying, and praying and sinning, the 
<A NAME="325"></A>gods will be propitiated, and we shall not be punished. 'But there is a 
<A NAME="326"></A>world below in which either we or our posterity will suffer for our unjust 
<A NAME="327"></A>deeds.' Yes, my friend, will be the reflection, but there are mysteries 
<A NAME="328"></A>and atoning deities, and these have great power. That is what mighty cities 
<A NAME="329"></A>declare; and the children of the gods, who were their poets and prophets, 
<A NAME="330"></A>bear a like testimony.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>On what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather 
<A NAME="332"></A>than the worst injustice? when, if we only unite the latter with a deceitful 
<A NAME="333"></A>regard to appearances, we shall fare to our mind both with gods and men, 
<A NAME="334"></A>in life and after death, as the most numerous and the highest authorities 
<A NAME="335"></A>tell us. Knowing all this, Socrates, how can a man who has any superiority 
<A NAME="336"></A>of mind or person or rank or wealth, be willing to honour justice; or indeed 
<A NAME="337"></A>to refrain from laughing when he hears justice praised? And even if there 
<A NAME="338"></A>should be some one who is able to disprove the truth of my words, and who 
<A NAME="339"></A>is satisfied that justice is best, still he is not angry with the unjust, 
<A NAME="340"></A>but is very ready to forgive them, because he also knows that men are not 
<A NAME="341"></A>just of their own free will; unless, peradventure, there be some one whom 
<A NAME="342"></A>the divinity within him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice, or 
<A NAME="343"></A>who has attained knowledge of the truth --but no other man. He only blames 
<A NAME="344"></A>injustice who, owing to cowardice or age or some weakness, has not the 
<A NAME="345"></A>power of being unjust. And this is proved by the fact that when he obtains 
<A NAME="346"></A>the power, he immediately becomes unjust as far as he can 
<A NAME="347"></A>be.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>The cause of all this, Socrates, was indicated by us at the beginning 
<A NAME="349"></A>of the argument, when my brother and I told you how astonished we were 
<A NAME="350"></A>to find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice --beginning with 
<A NAME="351"></A>the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us, and ending 
<A NAME="352"></A>with the men of our own time --no one has ever blamed injustice or praised 
<A NAME="353"></A>justice except with a view to the glories, honours, and benefits which 
<A NAME="354"></A>flow from them. No one has ever adequately described either in verse or 
<A NAME="355"></A>prose the true essential nature of either of them abiding in the soul, 
<A NAME="356"></A>and invisible to any human or divine eye; or shown that of all the things 
<A NAME="357"></A>of a man's soul which he has within him, justice is the greatest good, 
<A NAME="358"></A>and injustice the greatest evil. Had this been the universal strain, had 
<A NAME="359"></A>you sought to persuade us of this from our youth upwards, we should not 
<A NAME="360"></A>have been on the watch to keep one another from doing wrong, but every 
<A NAME="361"></A>one would have been his own watchman, because afraid, if he did wrong, 
<A NAME="362"></A>of harbouring in himself the greatest of evils. I dare say that Thrasymachus 
<A NAME="363"></A>and others would seriously hold the language which I have been merely repeating, 
<A NAME="364"></A>and words even stronger than these about justice and injustice, grossly, 
<A NAME="365"></A>as I conceive, perverting their true nature. But I speak in this vehement 
<A NAME="366"></A>manner, as I must frankly confess to you, because I want to hear from you 
<A NAME="367"></A>the opposite side; and I would ask you to show not only the superiority 
<A NAME="368"></A>which justice has over injustice, but what effect they have on the possessor 
<A NAME="369"></A>of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil to him. 
<A NAME="370"></A>And please, as Glaucon requested of you, to exclude reputations; for unless 
<A NAME="371"></A>you take away from each of them his true reputation and add on the false, 
<A NAME="372"></A>we shall say that you do not praise justice, but the appearance of it; 
<A NAME="373"></A>we shall think that you are only exhorting us to keep injustice dark, and 
<A NAME="374"></A>that you really agree with Thrasymachus in thinking that justice is another's 
<A NAME="375"></A>good and the interest of the stronger, and that injustice is a man's own 
<A NAME="376"></A>profit and interest, though injurious to the weaker. Now as you have admitted 
<A NAME="377"></A>that justice is one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed 
<A NAME="378"></A>for their results, but in a far greater degree for their own sakes --like 
<A NAME="379"></A>sight or hearing or knowledge or health, or any other real and natural 
<A NAME="380"></A>and not merely conventional good --I would ask you in your praise of justice 
<A NAME="381"></A>to regard one point only: I mean the essential good and evil which justice 
<A NAME="382"></A>and injustice work in the possessors of them. Let others praise justice 
<A NAME="383"></A>and censure injustice, magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and 
<A NAME="384"></A>abusing the other; that is a manner of arguing which, coming from them, 
<A NAME="385"></A>I am ready to tolerate, but from you who have spent your whole life in 
<A NAME="386"></A>the consideration of this question, unless I hear the contrary from your 
<A NAME="387"></A>own lips, I expect something better. And therefore, I say, not only prove 
<A NAME="388"></A>to us that justice is better than injustice, but show what they either 
<A NAME="389"></A>of them do to the possessor of them, which makes the one to be a good and 
<A NAME="390"></A>the other an evil, whether seen or unseen by gods and 
<A NAME="391"></A>men.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>Socrates - ADEIMANTUS
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>I had always admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus, but 
<A NAME="394"></A>on hearing these words I was quite delighted, and said: Sons of an illustrious 
<A NAME="395"></A>father, that was not a bad beginning of the Elegiac verses which the admirer 
<A NAME="396"></A>of Glaucon made in honour of you after you had distinguished yourselves 
<A NAME="397"></A>at the battle of Megara:--
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>'Sons of Ariston,' he sang, 'divine offspring of an illustrious 
<A NAME="399"></A>hero.' The epithet is very appropriate, for there is something truly divine 
<A NAME="400"></A>in being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice, 
<A NAME="401"></A>and remaining unconvinced by your own arguments. And I do believe that 
<A NAME="402"></A>you are not convinced --this I infer from your general character, for had 
<A NAME="403"></A>I judged only from your speeches I should have mistrusted you. But now, 
<A NAME="404"></A>the greater my confidence in you, the greater is my difficulty in knowing 
<A NAME="405"></A>what to say. For I am in a strait between two; on the one hand I feel that 
<A NAME="406"></A>I am unequal to the task; and my inability is brought home to me by the 
<A NAME="407"></A>fact that you were not satisfied with the answer which I made to Thrasymachus, 
<A NAME="408"></A>proving, as I thought, the superiority which justice has over injustice. 
<A NAME="409"></A>And yet I cannot refuse to help, while breath and speech remain to me; 
<A NAME="410"></A>I am afraid that there would be an impiety in being present when justice 
<A NAME="411"></A>is evil spoken of and not lifting up a hand in her defence. And therefore 
<A NAME="412"></A>I had best give such help as I can.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>Glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question 
<A NAME="414"></A>drop, but to proceed in the investigation. They wanted to arrive at the 
<A NAME="415"></A>truth, first, about the nature of justice and injustice, and secondly, 
<A NAME="416"></A>about their relative advantages. I told them, what I --really thought, 
<A NAME="417"></A>that the enquiry would be of a serious nature, and would require very good 
<A NAME="418"></A>eyes. Seeing then, I said, that we are no great wits, I think that we had 
<A NAME="419"></A>better adopt a method which I may illustrate thus; suppose that a short-sighted 
<A NAME="420"></A>person had been asked by some one to read small letters from a distance; 
<A NAME="421"></A>and it occurred to some one else that they might be found in another place 
<A NAME="422"></A>which was larger and in which the letters were larger --if they were the 
<A NAME="423"></A>same and he could read the larger letters first, and then proceed to the 
<A NAME="424"></A>lesser --this would have been thought a rare piece of good 
<A NAME="425"></A>fortune.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>Very true, said Adeimantus; but how does the illustration apply 
<A NAME="427"></A>to our enquiry?
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>I will tell you, I replied; justice, which is the subject of our 
<A NAME="429"></A>enquiry, is, as you know, sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual, 
<A NAME="430"></A>and sometimes as the virtue of a State.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR>True, he replied.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>And is not a State larger than an individual?
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>It is.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and 
<A NAME="435"></A>more easily discernible. I propose therefore that we enquire into the nature 
<A NAME="436"></A>of justice and injustice, first as they appear in the State, and secondly 
<A NAME="437"></A>in the individual, proceeding from the greater to the lesser and comparing 
<A NAME="438"></A>them.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>That, he said, is an excellent proposal.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>And if we imagine the State in process of creation, we shall see the 
<A NAME="441"></A>justice and injustice of the State in process of creation 
<A NAME="442"></A>also.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>I dare say.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>When the State is completed there may be a hope that the object of 
<A NAME="445"></A>our search will be more easily discovered.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR>Yes, far more easily.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>But ought we to attempt to construct one? I said; for to do so, as 
<A NAME="448"></A>I am inclined to think, will be a very serious task. Reflect 
<A NAME="449"></A>therefore.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>I have reflected, said Adeimantus, and am anxious that you should 
<A NAME="451"></A>proceed.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>A State, I said, arises, as I conceive, out of the needs of mankind; 
<A NAME="453"></A>no one is self-sufficing, but all of us have many wants. Can any other 
<A NAME="454"></A>origin of a State be imagined?
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>There can I be no other.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Then, as we have many wants, and many persons are needed to supply 
<A NAME="457"></A>them, one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another; and when 
<A NAME="458"></A>these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation the 
<A NAME="459"></A>body of inhabitants is termed a State.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>And they exchange with one another, and one gives, and another receives, 
<A NAME="462"></A>under the idea that the exchange will be for their good.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Then, I said, let us begin and create in idea a State; and yet the 
<A NAME="465"></A>true creator is necessity, who is the mother of our 
<A NAME="466"></A>invention.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>Of course, he replied.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Now the first and greatest of necessities is food, which is the condition 
<A NAME="469"></A>of life and existence.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>The second is a dwelling, and the third clothing and the 
<A NAME="472"></A>like.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>And now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great demand: 
<A NAME="475"></A>We may suppose that one man is a husbandman, another a builder, some one 
<A NAME="476"></A>else a weaver --shall we add to them a shoemaker, or perhaps some other 
<A NAME="477"></A>purveyor to our bodily wants?
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>Quite right.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>The barest notion of a State must include four or five 
<A NAME="480"></A>men.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>And how will they proceed? Will each bring the result of his labours 
<A NAME="483"></A>into a common stock? --the individual husbandman, for example, producing 
<A NAME="484"></A>for four, and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the 
<A NAME="485"></A>provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself; or 
<A NAME="486"></A>will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of producing 
<A NAME="487"></A>for them, but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food in a fourth 
<A NAME="488"></A>of the time, and in the remaining three-fourths of his time be employed 
<A NAME="489"></A>in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes, having no partnership with 
<A NAME="490"></A>others, but supplying himself all his own wants?
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>Adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and 
<A NAME="492"></A>not at producing everything.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR>Probably, I replied, that would be the better way; and when I hear 
<A NAME="494"></A>you say this, I am myself reminded that we are not all alike; there are 
<A NAME="495"></A>diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different 
<A NAME="496"></A>occupations.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>And will you have a work better done when the workman has many occupations, 
<A NAME="499"></A>or when he has only one?
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>When he has only one.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Further, there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done 
<A NAME="502"></A>at the right time?
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR>No doubt.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>For business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business 
<A NAME="505"></A>is at leisure; but the doer must follow up what he is doing, and make the 
<A NAME="506"></A>business his first object.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>He must.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>And if so, we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully 
<A NAME="509"></A>and easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is 
<A NAME="510"></A>natural to him and does it at the right time, and leaves other 
<A NAME="511"></A>things.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>Undoubtedly..
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Then more than four citizens will be required; for the husbandman will 
<A NAME="514"></A>not make his own plough or mattock, or other implements of agriculture, 
<A NAME="515"></A>if they are to be good for anything. Neither will the builder make his 
<A NAME="516"></A>tools --and he too needs many; and in like manner the weaver and 
<A NAME="517"></A>shoemaker.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Then carpenters, and smiths, and many other artisans, will be sharers 
<A NAME="520"></A>in our little State, which is already beginning to grow?
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>Yet even if we add neatherds, shepherds, and other herdsmen, in order 
<A NAME="523"></A>that our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with, and builders as well 
<A NAME="524"></A>as husbandmen may have draught cattle, and curriers and weavers fleeces 
<A NAME="525"></A>and hides, --still our State will not be very large.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>That is true; yet neither will it be a very small State which contains 
<A NAME="527"></A>all these.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>Then, again, there is the situation of the city --to find a place 
<A NAME="529"></A>where nothing need be imported is well-nigh impossible.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>Then there must be another class of citizens who will bring the required 
<A NAME="532"></A>supply from another city?
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>There must.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>But if the trader goes empty-handed, having nothing which they require 
<A NAME="535"></A>who would supply his need, he will come back empty-handed.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>That is certain.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>And therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for 
<A NAME="538"></A>themselves, but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate those 
<A NAME="539"></A>from whom their wants are supplied.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required?
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>They will.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Not to mention the importers and exporters, who are called 
<A NAME="544"></A>merchants?
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Then we shall want merchants?
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>We shall.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>And if merchandise is to be carried over the sea, skilful sailors will 
<A NAME="549"></A>also be needed, and in considerable numbers?
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>Yes, in considerable numbers.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Then, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions? 
<A NAME="552"></A>To secure such an exchange was, as you will remember, one of our principal 
<A NAME="553"></A>objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a 
<A NAME="554"></A>State.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR>Clearly they will buy and sell.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Then they will need a market-place, and a money-token for purposes 
<A NAME="557"></A>of exchange.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>Suppose now that a husbandman, or an artisan, brings some production 
<A NAME="560"></A>to market, and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with 
<A NAME="561"></A>him, --is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the 
<A NAME="562"></A>market-place?
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>Not at all; he will find people there who, seeing the want, undertake 
<A NAME="564"></A>the office of salesmen. In well-ordered States they are commonly those 
<A NAME="565"></A>who are the weakest in bodily strength, and therefore of little use for 
<A NAME="566"></A>any other purpose; their duty is to be in the market, and to give money 
<A NAME="567"></A>in exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money from 
<A NAME="568"></A>those who desire to buy.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>This want, then, creates a class of retail-traders in our State. 
<A NAME="570"></A>Is not 'retailer' the term which is applied to those who sit in the market-place 
<A NAME="571"></A>engaged in buying and selling, while those who wander from one city to 
<A NAME="572"></A>another are called merchants?
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>And there is another class of servants, who are intellectually hardly 
<A NAME="575"></A>on the level of companionship; still they have plenty of bodily strength 
<A NAME="576"></A>for labour, which accordingly they sell, and are called, if I do not mistake, 
<A NAME="577"></A>hirelings, hire being the name which is given to the price of their 
<A NAME="578"></A>labour.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Then hirelings will help to make up our population?
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>And now, Adeimantus, is our State matured and perfected?
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>I think so.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>Where, then, is justice, and where is injustice, and in what part of 
<A NAME="585"></A>the State did they spring up?
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR>Probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another. cannot 
<A NAME="587"></A>imagine that they are more likely to be found anywhere 
<A NAME="588"></A>else.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>I dare say that you are right in your suggestion, I said; we had 
<A NAME="590"></A>better think the matter out, and not shrink from the 
<A NAME="591"></A>enquiry.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>Let us then consider, first of all, what will be their way of life, 
<A NAME="593"></A>now that we have thus established them. Will they not produce corn, and 
<A NAME="594"></A>wine, and clothes, and shoes, and build houses for themselves? And when 
<A NAME="595"></A>they are housed, they will work, in summer, commonly, stripped and barefoot, 
<A NAME="596"></A>but in winter substantially clothed and shod. They will feed on barley-meal 
<A NAME="597"></A>and flour of wheat, baking and kneading them, making noble cakes and loaves; 
<A NAME="598"></A>these they will serve up on a mat of reeds or on clean leaves, themselves 
<A NAME="599"></A>reclining the while upon beds strewn with yew or myrtle. And they and their 
<A NAME="600"></A>children will feast, drinking of the wine which they have made, wearing 
<A NAME="601"></A>garlands on their heads, and hymning the praises of the gods, in happy 
<A NAME="602"></A>converse with one another. And they will take care that their families 
<A NAME="603"></A>do not exceed their means; having an eye to poverty or 
<A NAME="604"></A>war.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>Socrates - GLAUCON
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR>But, said Glaucon, interposing, you have not given them a relish 
<A NAME="607"></A>to their meal.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>True, I replied, I had forgotten; of course they must have a relish-salt, 
<A NAME="609"></A>and olives, and cheese, and they will boil roots and herbs such as country 
<A NAME="610"></A>people prepare; for a dessert we shall give them figs, and peas, and beans; 
<A NAME="611"></A>and they will roast myrtle-berries and acorns at the fire, drinking in 
<A NAME="612"></A>moderation. And with such a diet they may be expected to live in peace 
<A NAME="613"></A>and health to a good old age, and bequeath a similar life to their children 
<A NAME="614"></A>after them.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>Yes, Socrates, he said, and if you were providing for a city of 
<A NAME="616"></A>pigs, how else would you feed the beasts?
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR>But what would you have, Glaucon? I replied.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Why, he said, you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life. 
<A NAME="619"></A>People who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas, and dine 
<A NAME="620"></A>off tables, and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern 
<A NAME="621"></A>style.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said, now I understand: the question which you would have 
<A NAME="623"></A>me consider is, not only how a State, but how a luxurious State is created; 
<A NAME="624"></A>and possibly there is no harm in this, for in such a State we shall be 
<A NAME="625"></A>more likely to see how justice and injustice originate. In my opinion the 
<A NAME="626"></A>true and healthy constitution of the State is the one which I have described. 
<A NAME="627"></A>But if you wish also to see a State at fever heat, I have no objection. 
<A NAME="628"></A>For I suspect that many will not be satisfied with the simpler way of way 
<A NAME="629"></A>They will be for adding sofas, and tables, and other furniture; also dainties, 
<A NAME="630"></A>and perfumes, and incense, and courtesans, and cakes, all these not of 
<A NAME="631"></A>one sort only, but in every variety; we must go beyond the necessaries 
<A NAME="632"></A>of which I was at first speaking, such as houses, and clothes, and shoes: 
<A NAME="633"></A>the arts of the painter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion, 
<A NAME="634"></A>and gold and ivory and all sorts of materials must be 
<A NAME="635"></A>procured.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Then we must enlarge our borders; for the original healthy State is 
<A NAME="638"></A>no longer sufficient. Now will the city have to fill and swell with a multitude 
<A NAME="639"></A>of callings which are not required by any natural want; such as the whole 
<A NAME="640"></A>tribe of hunters and actors, of whom one large class have to do with forms 
<A NAME="641"></A>and colours; another will be the votaries of music --poets and their attendant 
<A NAME="642"></A>train of rhapsodists, players, dancers, contractors; also makers of divers 
<A NAME="643"></A>kinds of articles, including women's dresses. And we shall want more servants. 
<A NAME="644"></A>Will not tutors be also in request, and nurses wet and dry, tirewomen and 
<A NAME="645"></A>barbers, as well as confectioners and cooks; and swineherds, too, who were 
<A NAME="646"></A>not needed and therefore had no place in the former edition of our State, 
<A NAME="647"></A>but are needed now? They must not be forgotten: and there will be animals 
<A NAME="648"></A>of many other kinds, if people eat them.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>And living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians 
<A NAME="651"></A>than before?
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>Much greater.
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>And the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants 
<A NAME="654"></A>will be too small now, and not enough?
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>Quite true.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Then a slice of our neighbours' land will be wanted by us for pasture 
<A NAME="657"></A>and tillage, and they will want a slice of ours, if, like ourselves, they 
<A NAME="658"></A>exceed the limit of necessity, and give themselves up to the unlimited 
<A NAME="659"></A>accumulation of wealth?
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR>That, Socrates, will be inevitable.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>And so we shall go to war, Glaucon. Shall we not?
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>Most certainly, he replied.
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>Then without determining as yet whether war does good or harm, thus 
<A NAME="664"></A>much we may affirm, that now we have discovered war to be derived from 
<A NAME="665"></A>causes which are also the causes of almost all the evils in States, private 
<A NAME="666"></A>as well as public.
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>Undoubtedly.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>And our State must once more enlarge; and this time the will be nothing 
<A NAME="669"></A>short of a whole army, which will have to go out and fight with the invaders 
<A NAME="670"></A>for all that we have, as well as for the things and persons whom we were 
<A NAME="671"></A>describing above.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>Why? he said; are they not capable of defending 
<A NAME="673"></A>themselves?
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>No, I said; not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged 
<A NAME="675"></A>by all of us when we were framing the State: the principle, as you will 
<A NAME="676"></A>remember, was that one man cannot practise many arts with 
<A NAME="677"></A>success.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>But is not war an art?
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>And an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking?
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Quite true.
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>And the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be husbandman, or a weaver, 
<A NAME="684"></A>a builder --in order that we might have our shoes well made; but to him 
<A NAME="685"></A>and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was by nature 
<A NAME="686"></A>fitted, and at that he was to continue working all his life long and at 
<A NAME="687"></A>no other; he was not to let opportunities slip, and then he would become 
<A NAME="688"></A>a good workman. Now nothing can be more important than that the work of 
<A NAME="689"></A>a soldier should be well done. But is war an art so easily acquired that 
<A NAME="690"></A>a man may be a warrior who is also a husbandman, or shoemaker, or other 
<A NAME="691"></A>artisan; although no one in the world would be a good dice or draught player 
<A NAME="692"></A>who merely took up the game as a recreation, and had not from his earliest 
<A NAME="693"></A>years devoted himself to this and nothing else?
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>No tools will make a man a skilled workman, or master of defence, 
<A NAME="695"></A>nor be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them, and has 
<A NAME="696"></A>never bestowed any attention upon them. How then will he who takes up a 
<A NAME="697"></A>shield or other implement of war become a good fighter all in a day, whether 
<A NAME="698"></A>with heavy-armed or any other kind of troops?
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, the tools which would teach men their own use would 
<A NAME="700"></A>be beyond price.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR>And the higher the duties of the guardian, I said, the more time, 
<A NAME="702"></A>and skill, and art, and application will be needed by 
<A NAME="703"></A>him?
<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR>No doubt, he replied.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Will he not also require natural aptitude for his 
<A NAME="706"></A>calling?
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Then it will be our duty to select, if we can, natures which are fitted 
<A NAME="709"></A>for the task of guarding the city?
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR>It will.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>And the selection will be no easy matter, I said; but we must be brave 
<A NAME="712"></A>and do our best.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR>We must.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Is not the noble youth very like a well-bred dog in respect of guarding 
<A NAME="715"></A>and watching?
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean?
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>I mean that both of them ought to be quick to see, and swift to overtake 
<A NAME="718"></A>the enemy when they see him; and strong too if, when they have caught him, 
<A NAME="719"></A>they have to fight with him.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR>All these qualities, he replied, will certainly be required by 
<A NAME="721"></A>them.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Well, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight 
<A NAME="723"></A>well?
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>And is he likely to be brave who has no spirit, whether horse or dog 
<A NAME="726"></A>or any other animal? Have you never observed how invincible and unconquerable 
<A NAME="727"></A>is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any creature to 
<A NAME="728"></A>be absolutely fearless and indomitable?
<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>I have.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Then now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are required 
<A NAME="731"></A>in the guardian.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>And also of the mental ones; his soul is to be full of 
<A NAME="734"></A>spirit?
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>But are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another, 
<A NAME="737"></A>and with everybody else?
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>A difficulty by no means easy to overcome, he 
<A NAME="739"></A>replied.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>Whereas, I said, they ought to be dangerous to their enemies, and gentle 
<A NAME="741"></A>to their friends; if not, they will destroy themselves without waiting 
<A NAME="742"></A>for their enemies to destroy them.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>What is to be done then? I said; how shall we find a gentle nature 
<A NAME="745"></A>which has also a great spirit, for the one is the contradiction of the 
<A NAME="746"></A>other?
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>He will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two 
<A NAME="749"></A>qualities; and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible; and 
<A NAME="750"></A>hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR>I am afraid that what you say is true, he replied.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>Here feeling perplexed I began to think over what had preceded. My 
<A NAME="753"></A>friend, I said, no wonder that we are in a perplexity; for we have lost 
<A NAME="754"></A>sight of the image which we had before us.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean? he said.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>I mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite 
<A NAME="757"></A>qualities.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR>And where do you find them?
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>Many animals, I replied, furnish examples of them; our friend the dog 
<A NAME="760"></A>is a very good one: you know that well-bred dogs are perfectly gentle to 
<A NAME="761"></A>their familiars and acquaintances, and the reverse to 
<A NAME="762"></A>strangers.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I know.
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>Then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our 
<A NAME="765"></A>finding a guardian who has a similar combination of 
<A NAME="766"></A>qualities?
<A NAME="767"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>Would not he who is fitted to be a guardian, besides the spirited nature, 
<A NAME="769"></A>need to have the qualities of a philosopher?
<A NAME="770"></A><BR><BR>I do not apprehend your meaning.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>The trait of which I am speaking, I replied, may be also seen in the 
<A NAME="772"></A>dog, and is remarkable in the animal.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR>What trait?
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>Why, a dog, whenever he sees a stranger, is angry; when an acquaintance, 
<A NAME="775"></A>he welcomes him, although the one has never done him any harm, nor the 
<A NAME="776"></A>other any good. Did this never strike you as curious?
<A NAME="777"></A><BR><BR>The matter never struck me before; but I quite recognise the truth 
<A NAME="778"></A>of your remark.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR>And surely this instinct of the dog is very charming; --your dog 
<A NAME="780"></A>is a true philosopher.
<A NAME="781"></A><BR><BR>Why?
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>Why, because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy 
<A NAME="783"></A>only by the criterion of knowing and not knowing. And must not an animal 
<A NAME="784"></A>be a lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the 
<A NAME="785"></A>test of knowledge and ignorance?
<A NAME="786"></A><BR><BR>Most assuredly.
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>And is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is 
<A NAME="788"></A>philosophy?
<A NAME="789"></A><BR><BR>They are the same, he replied.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>And may we not say confidently of man also, that he who is likely to 
<A NAME="791"></A>be gentle to his friends and acquaintances, must by nature be a lover of 
<A NAME="792"></A>wisdom and knowledge?
<A NAME="793"></A><BR><BR>That we may safely affirm.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>Then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the State 
<A NAME="795"></A>will require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and 
<A NAME="796"></A>strength?
<A NAME="797"></A><BR><BR>Undoubtedly.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>Then we have found the desired natures; and now that we have found 
<A NAME="799"></A>them, how are they to be reared and educated? Is not this enquiry which 
<A NAME="800"></A>may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final 
<A NAME="801"></A>end --How do justice and injustice grow up in States? for we do not want 
<A NAME="802"></A>either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an inconvenient 
<A NAME="803"></A>length.
<A NAME="804"></A><BR><BR>Socrates - ADEIMANTUS
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>Adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to 
<A NAME="806"></A>us.
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>Then, I said, my dear friend, the task must not be given up, even if 
<A NAME="808"></A>somewhat long.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>Come then, and let us pass a leisure hour in story-telling, and our 
<A NAME="811"></A>story shall be the education of our heroes.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR><BR>By all means.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>And what shall be their education? Can we find a better than the traditional 
<A NAME="814"></A>sort? --and this has two divisions, gymnastic for the body, and music for 
<A NAME="815"></A>the soul.
<A NAME="816"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>Shall we begin education with music, and go on to gymnastic 
<A NAME="818"></A>afterwards?
<A NAME="819"></A><BR><BR>By all means.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>And when you speak of music, do you include literature or 
<A NAME="821"></A>not?
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>I do.
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>And literature may be either true or false?
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>And the young should be trained in both kinds, and we begin with the 
<A NAME="826"></A>false?
<A NAME="827"></A><BR><BR>I do not understand your meaning, he said.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>You know, I said, that we begin by telling children stories which, 
<A NAME="829"></A>though not wholly destitute of truth, are in the main fictitious; and these 
<A NAME="830"></A>stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn 
<A NAME="831"></A>gymnastics.
<A NAME="832"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>That was my meaning when I said that we must teach music before 
<A NAME="834"></A>gymnastics.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>Quite right, he said.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>You know also that the beginning is the most important part of any 
<A NAME="837"></A>work, especially in the case of a young and tender thing; for that is the 
<A NAME="838"></A>time at which the character is being formed and the desired impression 
<A NAME="839"></A>is more readily taken.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR>Quite true.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>And shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales 
<A NAME="842"></A>which may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds 
<A NAME="843"></A>ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish 
<A NAME="844"></A>them to have when they are grown up?
<A NAME="845"></A><BR><BR>We cannot.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>Then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers 
<A NAME="847"></A>of fiction, and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good, 
<A NAME="848"></A>and reject the bad; and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their 
<A NAME="849"></A>children the authorised ones only. Let them fashion the mind with such 
<A NAME="850"></A>tales, even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands; but 
<A NAME="851"></A>most of those which are now in use must be discarded.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR>Of what tales are you speaking? he said.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>You may find a model of the lesser in the greater, I said; for they 
<A NAME="854"></A>are necessarily of the same type, and there is the same spirit in both 
<A NAME="855"></A>of them.
<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR>Very likely, he replied; but I do not as yet know what you would 
<A NAME="857"></A>term the greater.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR>Those, I said, which are narrated by Homer and Hesiod, and the 
<A NAME="859"></A>rest of the poets, who have ever been the great story-tellers of 
<A NAME="860"></A>mankind.
<A NAME="861"></A><BR><BR>But which stories do you mean, he said; and what fault do you find 
<A NAME="862"></A>with them?
<A NAME="863"></A><BR><BR>A fault which is most serious, I said; the fault of telling a lie, 
<A NAME="864"></A>and, what is more, a bad lie.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR><BR>But when is this fault committed?
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>Whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods 
<A NAME="867"></A>and heroes, --as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow 
<A NAME="868"></A>of a likeness to the original.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that sort of thing is certainly very blamable; but 
<A NAME="870"></A>what are the stories which you mean?
<A NAME="871"></A><BR><BR>First of all, I said, there was that greatest of all lies, in high 
<A NAME="872"></A>places, which the poet told about Uranus, and which was a bad lie too, 
<A NAME="873"></A>--I mean what Hesiod says that Uranus did, and how Cronus retaliated on 
<A NAME="874"></A>him. The doings of Cronus, and the sufferings which in turn his son inflicted 
<A NAME="875"></A>upon him, even if they were true, ought certainly not to be lightly told 
<A NAME="876"></A>to young and thoughtless persons; if possible, they had better be buried 
<A NAME="877"></A>in silence. But if there is an absolute necessity for their mention, a 
<A NAME="878"></A>chosen few might hear them in a mystery, and they should sacrifice not 
<A NAME="879"></A>a common [Eleusinian] pig, but some huge and unprocurable victim; and then 
<A NAME="880"></A>the number of the hearers will be very few indeed.
<A NAME="881"></A><BR><BR>Why, yes, said he, those stories are extremely 
<A NAME="882"></A>objectionable.
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>Yes, Adeimantus, they are stories not to be repeated in our State; 
<A NAME="884"></A>the young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes 
<A NAME="885"></A>he is far from doing anything outrageous; and that even if he chastises 
<A NAME="886"></A>his father when does wrong, in whatever manner, he will only be following 
<A NAME="887"></A>the example of the first and greatest among the gods.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR><BR>I entirely agree with you, he said; in my opinion those stories 
<A NAME="889"></A>are quite unfit to be repeated.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR>Neither, if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of 
<A NAME="891"></A>quarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest, should any word 
<A NAME="892"></A>be said to them of the wars in heaven, and of the plots and fightings of 
<A NAME="893"></A>the gods against one another, for they are not true. No, we shall never 
<A NAME="894"></A>mention the battles of the giants, or let them be embroidered on garments; 
<A NAME="895"></A>and we shall be silent about the innumerable other quarrels of gods and 
<A NAME="896"></A>heroes with their friends and relatives. If they would only believe us 
<A NAME="897"></A>we would tell them that quarrelling is unholy, and that never up to this 
<A NAME="898"></A>time has there been any, quarrel between citizens; this is what old men 
<A NAME="899"></A>and old women should begin by telling children; and when they grow up, 
<A NAME="900"></A>the poets also should be told to compose for them in a similar spirit. 
<A NAME="901"></A>But the narrative of Hephaestus binding Here his mother, or how on another 
<A NAME="902"></A>occasion Zeus sent him flying for taking her part when she was being beaten, 
<A NAME="903"></A>and all the battles of the gods in Homer --these tales must not be admitted 
<A NAME="904"></A>into our State, whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning 
<A NAME="905"></A>or not. For a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is 
<A NAME="906"></A>literal; anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely 
<A NAME="907"></A>to become indelible and unalterable; and therefore it is most important 
<A NAME="908"></A>that the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous 
<A NAME="909"></A>thoughts.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR><BR>There you are right, he replied; but if any one asks where are 
<A NAME="911"></A>such models to be found and of what tales are you speaking --how shall 
<A NAME="912"></A>we answer him?
<A NAME="913"></A><BR><BR>I said to him, You and I, Adeimantus, at this moment are not poets, 
<A NAME="914"></A>but founders of a State: now the founders of a State ought to know the 
<A NAME="915"></A>general forms in which poets should cast their tales, and the limits which 
<A NAME="916"></A>must be observed by them, but to make the tales is not their 
<A NAME="917"></A>business.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said; but what are these forms of theology which 
<A NAME="919"></A>you mean?
<A NAME="920"></A><BR><BR>Something of this kind, I replied: --God is always to be represented 
<A NAME="921"></A>as he truly is, whatever be the sort of poetry, epic, lyric or tragic, 
<A NAME="922"></A>in which the representation is given.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR>Right.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>And is he not truly good? and must he not be represented as 
<A NAME="925"></A>such?
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>And no good thing is hurtful?
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>No, indeed.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>And that which is not hurtful hurts not?
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>And that which hurts not does no evil?
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>No.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>And can that which does no evil be a cause of evil?
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>And the good is advantageous?
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>And therefore the cause of well-being?
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>It follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things, 
<A NAME="940"></A>but of the good only?
<A NAME="941"></A><BR><BR>Assuredly.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>Then God, if he be good, is not the author of all things, as the many 
<A NAME="943"></A>assert, but he is the cause of a few things only, and not of most things 
<A NAME="944"></A>that occur to men. For few are the goods of human life, and many are the 
<A NAME="945"></A>evils, and the good is to be attributed to God alone; of the evils the 
<A NAME="946"></A>causes are to be sought elsewhere, and not in him.
<A NAME="947"></A><BR><BR>That appears to me to be most true, he said.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>Then we must not listen to Homer or to any other poet who is guilty 
<A NAME="949"></A>of the folly of saying that two casks Lie at the threshold of Zeus, full 
<A NAME="950"></A>of lots, one of good, the other of evil lots, and that he to whom Zeus 
<A NAME="951"></A>gives a mixture of the two Sometimes meets with evil fortune, at other 
<A NAME="952"></A>times with good; but that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled 
<A NAME="953"></A>ill,
<A NAME="954"></A><BR><BR>Him wild hunger drives o'er the beauteous earth. And 
<A NAME="955"></A>again
<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR>Zeus, who is the dispenser of good and evil to us. And if any one 
<A NAME="957"></A>asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties, which was really the 
<A NAME="958"></A>work of Pandarus, was brought about by Athene and Zeus, or that the strife 
<A NAME="959"></A>and contention of the gods was instigated by Themis and Zeus, he shall 
<A NAME="960"></A>not have our approval; neither will we allow our young men to hear the 
<A NAME="961"></A>words of Aeschylus, that God plants guilt among men when he desires utterly 
<A NAME="962"></A>to destroy a house. And if a poet writes of the sufferings of Niobe --the 
<A NAME="963"></A>subject of the tragedy in which these iambic verses occur --or of the house 
<A NAME="964"></A>of Pelops, or of the Trojan war or on any similar theme, either we must 
<A NAME="965"></A>not permit him to say that these are the works of God, or if they are of 
<A NAME="966"></A>God, he must devise some explanation of them such as we are seeking; he 
<A NAME="967"></A>must say that God did what was just and right, and they were the better 
<A NAME="968"></A>for being punished; but that those who are punished are miserable, and 
<A NAME="969"></A>that God is the author of their misery --the poet is not to be permitted 
<A NAME="970"></A>to say; though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they require 
<A NAME="971"></A>to be punished, and are benefited by receiving punishment from God; but 
<A NAME="972"></A>that God being good is the author of evil to any one is to be strenuously 
<A NAME="973"></A>denied, and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or prose by any one 
<A NAME="974"></A>whether old or young in any well-ordered commonwealth. Such a fiction is 
<A NAME="975"></A>suicidal, ruinous, impious.
<A NAME="976"></A><BR><BR>I agree with you, he replied, and am ready to give my assent to 
<A NAME="977"></A>the law.
<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR>Let this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the 
<A NAME="979"></A>gods, to which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform --that 
<A NAME="980"></A>God is not the author of all things, but of good only.
<A NAME="981"></A><BR><BR>That will do, he said.
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>And what do you think of a second principle? Shall I ask you whether 
<A NAME="983"></A>God is a magician, and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one shape, 
<A NAME="984"></A>and now in another --sometimes himself changing and passing into many forms, 
<A NAME="985"></A>sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such transformations; or is 
<A NAME="986"></A>he one and the same immutably fixed in his own proper 
<A NAME="987"></A>image?
<A NAME="988"></A><BR><BR>I cannot answer you, he said, without more thought.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>Well, I said; but if we suppose a change in anything, that change must 
<A NAME="990"></A>be effected either by the thing itself, or by some other 
<A NAME="991"></A>thing?
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR>Most certainly.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>And things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered 
<A NAME="994"></A>or discomposed; for example, when healthiest and strongest, the human frame 
<A NAME="995"></A>is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks, and the plant which 
<A NAME="996"></A>is in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the heat of the 
<A NAME="997"></A>sun or any similar causes.
<A NAME="998"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>And will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged 
<A NAME="1000"></A>by any external influence?
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>And the same principle, as I should suppose, applies to all composite 
<A NAME="1003"></A>things --furniture, houses, garments; when good and well made, they are 
<A NAME="1004"></A>least altered by time and circumstances.
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>Then everything which is good, whether made by art or nature, or both, 
<A NAME="1007"></A>is least liable to suffer change from without?
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>But surely God and the things of God are in every way 
<A NAME="1010"></A>perfect?
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>Of course they are.
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>Then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many 
<A NAME="1013"></A>shapes?
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>He cannot.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>But may he not change and transform himself?
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>Clearly, he said, that must be the case if he is changed at 
<A NAME="1017"></A>all.
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>And will he then change himself for the better and fairer, or for the 
<A NAME="1019"></A>worse and more unsightly?
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR><BR>If he change at all he can only change for the worse, for we cannot 
<A NAME="1021"></A>suppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty.
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR><BR>Very true, Adeimantus; but then, would any one, whether God or 
<A NAME="1023"></A>man, desire to make himself worse?
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>Then it is impossible that God should ever be willing to change; being, 
<A NAME="1026"></A>as is supposed, the fairest and best that is conceivable, every god remains 
<A NAME="1027"></A>absolutely and for ever in his own form.
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR><BR>That necessarily follows, he said, in my judgment.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>Then, I said, my dear friend, let none of the poets tell us 
<A NAME="1030"></A>that
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR><BR>The gods, taking the disguise of strangers from other lands, walk 
<A NAME="1032"></A>up and down cities in all sorts of forms; and let no one slander Proteus 
<A NAME="1033"></A>and Thetis, neither let any one, either in tragedy or in any other kind 
<A NAME="1034"></A>of poetry, introduce Here disguised in the likeness of a priestess asking 
<A NAME="1035"></A>an alms
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR><BR>For the life-giving daughters of Inachus the river of Argos; --let 
<A NAME="1037"></A>us have no more lies of that sort. Neither must we have mothers under the 
<A NAME="1038"></A>influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad version of these 
<A NAME="1039"></A>myths --telling how certain gods, as they say, 'Go about by night in the 
<A NAME="1040"></A>likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms'; but let them take heed 
<A NAME="1041"></A>lest they make cowards of their children, and at the same time speak blasphemy 
<A NAME="1042"></A>against the gods.
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR><BR>Heaven forbid, he said.
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>But although the gods are themselves unchangeable, still by witchcraft 
<A NAME="1045"></A>and deception they may make us think that they appear in various 
<A NAME="1046"></A>forms?
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps, he replied.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>Well, but can you imagine that God will be willing to lie, whether 
<A NAME="1049"></A>in word or deed, or to put forth a phantom of himself?
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR><BR>I cannot say, he replied.
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>Do you not know, I said, that the true lie, if such an expression may 
<A NAME="1052"></A>be allowed, is hated of gods and men?
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean? he said.
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>I mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest 
<A NAME="1055"></A>and highest part of himself, or about the truest and highest matters; there, 
<A NAME="1056"></A>above all, he is most afraid of a lie having possession of 
<A NAME="1057"></A>him.
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR><BR>Still, he said, I do not comprehend you.
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>The reason is, I replied, that you attribute some profound meaning 
<A NAME="1060"></A>to my words; but I am only saying that deception, or being deceived or 
<A NAME="1061"></A>uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of themselves, 
<A NAME="1062"></A>which is the soul, and in that part of them to have and to hold the lie, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>is what mankind least like; --that, I say, is what they utterly 
<A NAME="1064"></A>detest.
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR><BR>There is nothing more hateful to them.
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>And, as I was just now remarking, this ignorance in the soul of him 
<A NAME="1067"></A>who is deceived may be called the true lie; for the lie in words is only 
<A NAME="1068"></A>a kind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the soul, 
<A NAME="1069"></A>not pure unadulterated falsehood. Am I not right?
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR><BR>Perfectly right.
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>The true lie is hated not only by the gods, but also by 
<A NAME="1072"></A>men?
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>Whereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful; 
<A NAME="1075"></A>in dealing with enemies --that would be an instance; or again, when those 
<A NAME="1076"></A>whom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to do 
<A NAME="1077"></A>some harm, then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or preventive; also 
<A NAME="1078"></A>in the tales of mythology, of which we were just now speaking --because 
<A NAME="1079"></A>we do not know the truth about ancient times, we make falsehood as much 
<A NAME="1080"></A>like truth as we can, and so turn it to account.
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>But can any of these reasons apply to God? Can we suppose that he is 
<A NAME="1083"></A>ignorant of antiquity, and therefore has recourse to 
<A NAME="1084"></A>invention?
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR><BR>That would be ridiculous, he said.
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>Then the lying poet has no place in our idea of 
<A NAME="1087"></A>God?
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>I should say not.
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>Or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of 
<A NAME="1090"></A>enemies?
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>That is inconceivable.
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>But he may have friends who are senseless or mad?
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>But no mad or senseless person can be a friend of 
<A NAME="1094"></A>God.
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>Then no motive can be imagined why God should lie?
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>None whatever.
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>Then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of 
<A NAME="1098"></A>falsehood?
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>Then is God perfectly simple and true both in word and deed; he changes 
<A NAME="1101"></A>not; he deceives not, either by sign or word, by dream or waking 
<A NAME="1102"></A>vision.
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR><BR>Your thoughts, he said, are the reflection of my 
<A NAME="1104"></A>own.
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>You agree with me then, I said, that this is the second type or form 
<A NAME="1106"></A>in which we should write and speak about divine things. The gods are not 
<A NAME="1107"></A>magicians who transform themselves, neither do they deceive mankind in 
<A NAME="1108"></A>any way.
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR><BR>I grant that.
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>Then, although we are admirers of Homer, we do not admire the lying 
<A NAME="1111"></A>dream which Zeus sends to Agamemnon; neither will we praise the verses 
<A NAME="1112"></A>of Aeschylus in which Thetis says that Apollo at her 
<A NAME="1113"></A>nuptials
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR><BR>Was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to he 
<A NAME="1115"></A>long, and to know no sickness. And when he had spoken of my lot as in all 
<A NAME="1116"></A>things blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my soul. 
<A NAME="1117"></A>And I thought that the word of Phoebus being divine and full of prophecy, 
<A NAME="1118"></A>would not fail. And now he himself who uttered the strain, he who was present 
<A NAME="1119"></A>at the banquet, and who said this --he it is who has slain my 
<A NAME="1120"></A>son.
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR><BR>These are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse 
<A NAME="1122"></A>our anger; and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus; neither shall 
<A NAME="1123"></A>we allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young, 
<A NAME="1124"></A>meaning, as we do, that our guardians, as far as men can be, should be 
<A NAME="1125"></A>true worshippers of the gods and like them.
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR><BR>I entirely agree, be said, in these principles, and promise to 
<A NAME="1127"></A>make them my laws.
