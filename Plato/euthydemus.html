The Lyceum.<BR></BLOCKQUOTE><HR SIZE="1" COLOR="990033" NOSHADE><BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR><B>Crito.</B> Who was the person, Socrates, with whom you were 
<A NAME="19"></A>talking yesterday at the Lyceum? There was such a crowd around you that 
<A NAME="20"></A>I could not get within hearing, but I caught a sight of him over their 
<A NAME="21"></A>heads, and I made out, as I thought, that he was a stranger with whom you 
<A NAME="22"></A>were talking: who was he?
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR><B>Socrates.</B> There were two, Crito; which of them do you 
<A NAME="24"></A>mean?
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> The one whom I mean was seated second from you on the 
<A NAME="26"></A>right-hand side. In the middle was Cleinias the young son of Axiochus, 
<A NAME="27"></A>who has wonderfully grown; he is only about the age of my own Critobulus, 
<A NAME="28"></A>but he is much forwarder and very good-looking: the other is thin and looks 
<A NAME="29"></A>younger than he is.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> He whom you mean, Crito, is Euthydemus; and on my left 
<A NAME="31"></A>hand there was his brother Dionysodorus, who also took part in the 
<A NAME="32"></A>conversation.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> Neither of them are known to me, Socrates; they are 
<A NAME="34"></A>a new importation of Sophists, as I should imagine. Of what country are 
<A NAME="35"></A>they, and what is their line of wisdom?
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> As to their origin, I believe that they are natives 
<A NAME="37"></A>of this part of the world, and have migrated from Chios to Thurii; they 
<A NAME="38"></A>were driven out of Thurii, and have been living for many years past in 
<A NAME="39"></A>these regions. As to their wisdom, about which you ask, Crito, they are 
<A NAME="40"></A>wonderful-consummate! I never knew what the true pancratiast was before; 
<A NAME="41"></A>they are simply made up of fighting, not like the two Acarnanian brothers 
<A NAME="42"></A>who fight with their bodies only, but this pair of heroes, besides being 
<A NAME="43"></A>perfect in the use of their bodies, are invincible in every sort of warfare; 
<A NAME="44"></A>for they are capital at fighting in armour, and will teach the art to any 
<A NAME="45"></A>one who pays them; and also they are most skilful in legal warfare; they 
<A NAME="46"></A>will plead themselves and teach others to speak and to compose speeches 
<A NAME="47"></A>which will have an effect upon the courts. And this was only the beginning 
<A NAME="48"></A>of their wisdom, but they have at last carried out the pancratiastic art 
<A NAME="49"></A>to the very end, and have mastered the only mode of fighting which had 
<A NAME="50"></A>been hitherto neglected by them; and now no one dares even to stand up 
<A NAME="51"></A>against them: such is their skill in the war of words, that they can refute 
<A NAME="52"></A>any proposition whether true or false. Now I am thinking, Crito, of placing 
<A NAME="53"></A>myself in their hands; for they say that in a short time they can impart 
<A NAME="54"></A>their skill to any one.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> But, Socrates, are you not too old? there may be reason 
<A NAME="56"></A>to fear that.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Certainly not, Crito; as I will prove to you, for I 
<A NAME="58"></A>have the consolation of knowing that they began this art of disputation 
<A NAME="59"></A>which I covet, quite, as I may say, in old age; last year, or the year 
<A NAME="60"></A>before, they had none of their new wisdom. I am only apprehensive that 
<A NAME="61"></A>I may bring the two strangers into disrepute, as I have done Connus the 
<A NAME="62"></A>son of Metrobius, the harp-player, who is still my music-master; for when 
<A NAME="63"></A>the boys who go to him see me going with them, they laugh at me and call 
<A NAME="64"></A>him grandpapa's master. Now I should not like the strangers to experience 
<A NAME="65"></A>similar treatment; the fear of ridicule may make them unwilling to receive 
<A NAME="66"></A>me; and therefore, Crito, I shall try and persuade some old men to accompany 
<A NAME="67"></A>me to them, as I persuaded them to go with me to Connus, and I hope that 
<A NAME="68"></A>you will make one: and perhaps we had better take your sons as a bait; 
<A NAME="69"></A>they will want to have them as pupils, and for the sake of them willing 
<A NAME="70"></A>to receive us.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> I see no objection, Socrates, if you like; but first 
<A NAME="72"></A>I wish that you would give me a description of their wisdom, that I may 
<A NAME="73"></A>know beforehand what we are going to learn.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> In less than no time you shall hear; for I cannot say 
<A NAME="75"></A>that I did not attend-I paid great attention to them, and I remember and 
<A NAME="76"></A>will endeavour to repeat the whole story. Providentially I was sitting 
<A NAME="77"></A>alone in the dressing-room of the Lyceum where you saw me, and was about 
<A NAME="78"></A>to depart; when I was getting up I recognized the familiar divine sign: 
<A NAME="79"></A>so I sat down again, and in a little while the two brothers Euthydemus 
<A NAME="80"></A>and Dionysodorus came in, and several others with them, whom I believe 
<A NAME="81"></A>to be their disciples, and they walked about in the covered court; they 
<A NAME="82"></A>had not taken more than two or three turns when Cleinias entered, who, 
<A NAME="83"></A>as you truly say, is very much improved: he was followed by a host of lovers, 
<A NAME="84"></A>one of whom was Ctesippus the Paeanian, a well-bred youth, but also having 
<A NAME="85"></A>the wildness of youth. Cleinias saw me from the entrance as I was sitting 
<A NAME="86"></A>alone, and at once came and sat down on the right hand of me, as you describe; 
<A NAME="87"></A>and Dionysodorus and Euthydemus, when they saw him, at first stopped and 
<A NAME="88"></A>talked with one another, now and then glancing at us, for I particularly 
<A NAME="89"></A>watched them; and then Euthydemus came and sat down by the youth, and the 
<A NAME="90"></A>other by me on the left hand; the rest anywhere. I saluted the brothers, 
<A NAME="91"></A>whom I had not seen for a long time; and then I said to Cleinias: Here 
<A NAME="92"></A>are two wise men, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, Cleinias, wise not in a 
<A NAME="93"></A>small but in a large way of wisdom, for they know all about war,-all that 
<A NAME="94"></A>a good general ought to know about the array and command of an army, and 
<A NAME="95"></A>the whole art of fighting in armour: and they know about law too, and can 
<A NAME="96"></A>teach a man how to use the weapons of the courts when he is 
<A NAME="97"></A>injured.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>They heard me say this, but only despised me. I observed that they 
<A NAME="99"></A>looked at one another, and both of them laughed; and then Euthydemus Those, 
<A NAME="100"></A>Socrates, are matters which we no longer pursue seriously; to us they are 
<A NAME="101"></A>secondary occupations.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, I said, if such occupations are regarded by you as secondary, 
<A NAME="103"></A>what must the principal one be; tell me, I beseech you, what that noble 
<A NAME="104"></A>study is?
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>The teaching of virtue, Socrates, he replied, is our principal 
<A NAME="106"></A>occupation; and we believe that we can impart it better and quicker than 
<A NAME="107"></A>any man.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>My God! I said, and where did you learn that? I always thought, 
<A NAME="109"></A>as I was saying just now, that your chief accomplishment was the art of 
<A NAME="110"></A>fighting in armour; and I used to say as much of you, for I remember that 
<A NAME="111"></A>you professed this when you were here before. But now if you really have 
<A NAME="112"></A>the other knowledge, O forgive me: I address you as I would superior beings, 
<A NAME="113"></A>and ask you to pardon the impiety of my former expressions. But are you 
<A NAME="114"></A>quite sure about this, Dionysodorus and Euthydemus? the promise is so vast, 
<A NAME="115"></A>that a feeling of incredulity steals over me.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>You may take our word, Socrates, for the fact.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>Then I think you happier in having such a treasure than the great king 
<A NAME="118"></A>is in the possession of his kingdom. And please to tell me whether you 
<A NAME="119"></A>intend to exhibit your wisdom; or what will you do?
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>That is why we have come hither, Socrates; and our purpose is not 
<A NAME="121"></A>only to exhibit, but also to teach any one who likes to 
<A NAME="122"></A>learn.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>But I can promise you, I said, that every unvirtuous person will 
<A NAME="124"></A>want to learn. I shall be the first; and there is the youth Cleinias, and 
<A NAME="125"></A>Ctesippus: and here are several others, I said, pointing to the lovers 
<A NAME="126"></A>of Cleinias, who were beginning to gather round us. Now Ctesippus was sitting 
<A NAME="127"></A>at some distance from Cleinias; and when Euthydemus leaned forward in talking 
<A NAME="128"></A>with me, he was prevented from seeing Cleinias, who was between us; and 
<A NAME="129"></A>so, partly because he wanted to look at his love, and also because he was 
<A NAME="130"></A>interested, he jumped up and stood opposite to us: and all the other admirers 
<A NAME="131"></A>of Cleinias, as well as the disciples of Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, followed 
<A NAME="132"></A>his example. And these were the persons whom I showed to Euthydemus, telling 
<A NAME="133"></A>him that they were all eager to learn: to which Ctesippus and all of them 
<A NAME="134"></A>with one voice vehemently assented, and bid him exhibit the power of his 
<A NAME="135"></A>wisdom. Then I said: O Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, I earnestly request 
<A NAME="136"></A>you to do myself and the company the favour to exhibit. There may be some 
<A NAME="137"></A>trouble in giving the whole exhibition; but tell me one thing,-can you 
<A NAME="138"></A>make a good man of him only who is already convinced that he ought to learn 
<A NAME="139"></A>of you, or of him also who is not convinced, either because he imagines 
<A NAME="140"></A>that virtue is a thing which cannot be taught at all, or that you are not 
<A NAME="141"></A>the teachers of it? Has your art power to persuade him, who is of the latter 
<A NAME="142"></A>temper of mind, that virtue can be taught; and that you are the men from 
<A NAME="143"></A>whom he will best learn it?
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, Socrates, said Dionysodorus; our art will do 
<A NAME="145"></A>both.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>And you and your brother, Dionysodorus, I said, of all men who are 
<A NAME="147"></A>now living are the most likely to stimulate him to philosophy and to the 
<A NAME="148"></A>study of virtue?
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>Yes, Socrates, I rather think that we are.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Then I wish that you would be so good as to defer the other part of 
<A NAME="151"></A>the exhibition, and only try to persuade the youth whom you see here that 
<A NAME="152"></A>he ought to be a philosopher and study virtue. Exhibit that, and you will 
<A NAME="153"></A>confer a great favour on me and on every one present; for the fact is I 
<A NAME="154"></A>and all of us are extremely anxious that he should become truly good. His 
<A NAME="155"></A>name is Cleinias, and he is the son of Axiochus, and grandson of the old 
<A NAME="156"></A>Alcibiades, cousin of the Alcibiades that now is. He is quite young, and 
<A NAME="157"></A>we are naturally afraid that some one may get the start of us, and turn 
<A NAME="158"></A>his mind in a wrong direction, and he may be ruined. Your visit, therefore, 
<A NAME="159"></A>is most happily timed; and I hope that you will make a trial of the young 
<A NAME="160"></A>man, and converse with him in our presence, if you have no 
<A NAME="161"></A>objection.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>These were pretty nearly the expressions which I used; and Euthydemus, 
<A NAME="163"></A>in a manly and at the same time encouraging tone, replied: There can be 
<A NAME="164"></A>no objection, Socrates, if the young man is only willing to answer 
<A NAME="165"></A>questions.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>He is quite accustomed to do so, I replied; for his friends often 
<A NAME="167"></A>come and ask him questions and argue with him; and therefore he is quite 
<A NAME="168"></A>at home in answering.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>What followed, Crito, how can I rightly narrate? For not slight 
<A NAME="170"></A>is the task of rehearsing infinite wisdom, and therefore, like the poets, 
<A NAME="171"></A>I ought to commence my relation with an invocation to Memory and the Muses. 
<A NAME="172"></A>Now Euthydemus, if I remember rightly, began nearly as follows: O Cleinias, 
<A NAME="173"></A>are those who learn the wise or the ignorant?
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>The youth, overpowered by the question blushed, and in his perplexity 
<A NAME="175"></A>looked at me for help; and I, knowing that he was disconcerted, said: Take 
<A NAME="176"></A>courage, Cleinias, and answer like a man whichever you think; for my belief 
<A NAME="177"></A>is that you will derive the greatest benefit from their 
<A NAME="178"></A>questions.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>Whichever he answers, said Dionysodorus, leaning forward so as 
<A NAME="180"></A>to catch my ear, his face beaming with laughter, I prophesy that he will 
<A NAME="181"></A>be refuted, Socrates.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>While he was speaking to me, Cleinias gave his answer: and therefore 
<A NAME="183"></A>I had no time to warn him of the predicament in which he was placed, and 
<A NAME="184"></A>he answered that those who learned were the wise.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>Euthydemus proceeded: There are some whom you would call teachers, 
<A NAME="186"></A>are there not?
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>The boy assented.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>And they are the teachers of those who learn-the grammar-master and 
<A NAME="189"></A>the lyre master used to teach you and other boys; and you were the 
<A NAME="190"></A>learners?
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>And when you were learners you did not as yet know the things which 
<A NAME="193"></A>you were learning?
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>No, he said.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>And were you wise then?
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>No, indeed, he said.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>But if you were not wise you were unlearned?
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>You then, learning what you did not know, were unlearned when you were 
<A NAME="200"></A>learning?
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>The youth nodded assent.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Then the unlearned learn, and not the wise, Cleinias, as you 
<A NAME="203"></A>imagine.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>At these words the followers of Euthydemus, of whom I spoke, like 
<A NAME="205"></A>a chorus at the bidding of their director, laughed and cheered. Then, before 
<A NAME="206"></A>the youth had time to recover his breath, Dionysodorus cleverly took him 
<A NAME="207"></A>in hand, and said: Yes, Cleinias; and when the grammar master dictated 
<A NAME="208"></A>anything to you, were they the wise boys or the unlearned who learned the 
<A NAME="209"></A>dictation?
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>The wise, replied Cleinias.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Then after all the wise are the learners and not the unlearned; and 
<A NAME="212"></A>your last answer to Euthydemus was wrong.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>Then once more the admirers of the two heroes, in an ecstasy at 
<A NAME="214"></A>their wisdom, gave vent to another peal of laughter, while the rest of 
<A NAME="215"></A>us were silent and amazed. Euthydemus, observing this, determined to persevere 
<A NAME="216"></A>with the youth; and in order to heighten the effect went on asking another 
<A NAME="217"></A>similar question, which might be compared to the double turn of an expert 
<A NAME="218"></A>dancer. Do those, said he, who learn, learn what they know, or what they 
<A NAME="219"></A>do not know?
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>Again Dionysodorus whispered to me: That, Socrates, is just another 
<A NAME="221"></A>of the same sort.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>Good heavens, I said; and your last question was so 
<A NAME="223"></A>good!
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>Like all our other questions, Socrates, he replied-inevitable.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>I see the reason, I said, why you are in such reputation among your 
<A NAME="226"></A>disciples.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>Meanwhile Cleinias had answered Euthydemus that those who learned 
<A NAME="228"></A>learn what they do not know; and he put him through a series of questions 
<A NAME="229"></A>the same as before.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>Do you not know letters?
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>He assented.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>All letters?
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>But when the teacher dictates to you, does he not dictate 
<A NAME="235"></A>letters?
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>To this also he assented.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Then if you know all letters, he dictates that which you 
<A NAME="238"></A>know?
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>This again was admitted by him.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Then, said the other, you do not learn that which he dictates; but 
<A NAME="241"></A>he only who does not know letters learns?
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>Nay, said Cleinias; but I do learn.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Then, said he, you learn what you know, if you know all the 
<A NAME="244"></A>letters?
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>He admitted that.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Then, he said, you were wrong in your answer.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>The word was hardly out of his mouth when Dionysodorus took up the 
<A NAME="248"></A>argument, like a ball which he caught, and had another throw at the youth. 
<A NAME="249"></A>Cleinias, he said, Euthydemus is deceiving you. For tell me now, is not 
<A NAME="250"></A>learning acquiring knowledge of that which one learns?
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>Cleinias assented.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>And knowing is having knowledge at the time?
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>He agreed.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>And not knowing is not having knowledge at the time?
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>He admitted that.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>And are those who acquire those who have or have not a 
<A NAME="257"></A>thing?
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Those who have not.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>And have you not admitted that those who do not know are of the number 
<A NAME="260"></A>of those who have not?
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>He nodded assent.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Then those who learn are of the class of those who acquire, and not 
<A NAME="263"></A>of those who have?
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>He agreed.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Then, Cleinias, he said, those who do not know learn, and not those 
<A NAME="266"></A>who know.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>Euthydemus was proceeding to give the youth a third fall; but I 
<A NAME="268"></A>knew that he was in deep water, and therefore, as I wanted to give him 
<A NAME="269"></A>a respite lest he should be disheartened, I said to him consolingly: You 
<A NAME="270"></A>must not be surprised, Cleinias, at the singularity of their mode of speech: 
<A NAME="271"></A>this I say because you may not understand what the two strangers are doing 
<A NAME="272"></A>with you; they are only initiating you after the manner of the Corybantes 
<A NAME="273"></A>in the mysteries; and this answers to the enthronement, which, if you have 
<A NAME="274"></A>ever been initiated, is, as you will know, accompanied by dancing and sport; 
<A NAME="275"></A>and now they are just prancing and dancing about you, and will next proceed 
<A NAME="276"></A>to initiate you; imagine then that you have gone through the first part 
<A NAME="277"></A>of the sophistical ritual, which, as Prodicus says, begins with initiation 
<A NAME="278"></A>into the correct use of terms. The two foreign gentlemen, perceiving that 
<A NAME="279"></A>you did not know, wanted to explain to you that the word "to learn" has 
<A NAME="280"></A>two meanings, and is used, first, in the sense of acquiring knowledge of 
<A NAME="281"></A>some matter of which you previously have no knowledge, and also, when you 
<A NAME="282"></A>have the knowledge, in the sense of reviewing this matter, whether something 
<A NAME="283"></A>done or spoken by the light of this newly-acquired knowledge; the latter 
<A NAME="284"></A>is generally called "knowing" rather than "learning," but the word "learning" 
<A NAME="285"></A>is also used; and you did not see, as they explained to you, that the term 
<A NAME="286"></A>is employed of two opposite sorts of men, of those who know, and of those 
<A NAME="287"></A>who do not know. There was a similar trick in the second question, when 
<A NAME="288"></A>they asked you whether men learn what they know or what they do not know. 
<A NAME="289"></A>These parts of learning are not serious, and therefore I say that the gentlemen 
<A NAME="290"></A>are not serious, but are only playing with you. For if a man had all that 
<A NAME="291"></A>sort of knowledge that ever was, he would not be at all the wiser; he would 
<A NAME="292"></A>only be able to play with men, tripping them up and over setting them with 
<A NAME="293"></A>distinctions of words. He would be like a person who pulls away a stool 
<A NAME="294"></A>from some one when he is about to sit down, and then laughs and makes merry 
<A NAME="295"></A>at the sight of his friend overturned and laid on his back. And you must 
<A NAME="296"></A>regard all that has hitherto passed between you and them as merely play. 
<A NAME="297"></A>But in what is to follow I am certain that they will exhibit to you their 
<A NAME="298"></A>serious purpose, and keep their promise (I will show them how); for they 
<A NAME="299"></A>promised to give me a sample of the hortatory philosophy, but I suppose 
<A NAME="300"></A>that they wanted to have a game with you first. And now, Euthydemus and 
<A NAME="301"></A>Dionysodorus, I think that we have had enough of this. Will you let me 
<A NAME="302"></A>see you explaining to the young man how he is to apply himself to the study 
<A NAME="303"></A>of virtue and wisdom? And I will first show you what I conceive to be the 
<A NAME="304"></A>nature of the task, and what sort of a discourse I desire to hear; and 
<A NAME="305"></A>if I do this in a very inartistic and ridiculous manner, do not laugh at 
<A NAME="306"></A>me, for I only venture to improvise before you because I am eager to hear 
<A NAME="307"></A>your wisdom: and I must therefore ask you and your disciples to refrain 
<A NAME="308"></A>from laughing. And now, O son of Axiochus, let me put a question to you: 
<A NAME="309"></A>Do not all men desire happiness? And yet, perhaps, this is one of those 
<A NAME="310"></A>ridiculous questions which I am afraid to ask, and which ought not to be 
<A NAME="311"></A>asked by a sensible man: for what human being is there who does not desire 
<A NAME="312"></A>happiness?
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>There is no one, said Cleinias, who does not.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Well, then, I said, since we all of us desire happiness, how can we 
<A NAME="315"></A>be happy?-that is the next question. Shall we not be happy if we have many 
<A NAME="316"></A>good things? And this, perhaps, is even a more simple question than the 
<A NAME="317"></A>first, for there can be no doubt of the answer.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>He assented.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>And what things do we esteem good? No solemn sage is required to tell 
<A NAME="320"></A>us this, which may be easily answered; for every one will say that wealth 
<A NAME="321"></A>is a good.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>And are not health and beauty goods, and other personal 
<A NAME="324"></A>gifts?
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>He agreed.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Can there be any doubt that good birth, and power, and honours in one's 
<A NAME="327"></A>own land, are goods?
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>He assented.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>And what other goods are there? I said. What do you say of temperance, 
<A NAME="330"></A>justice, courage: do you not verily and indeed think, Cleinias, that we 
<A NAME="331"></A>shall be more right in ranking them as goods than in not ranking them as 
<A NAME="332"></A>goods? For a dispute might possibly arise about this. What then do you 
<A NAME="333"></A>say?
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>They are goods, said Cleinias.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Very well, I said; and where in the company shall we find a place for 
<A NAME="336"></A>wisdom-among the goods or not?
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>Among the goods.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>And now, I said, think whether we have left out any considerable 
<A NAME="339"></A>goods.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>I do not think that we have, said Cleinias.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Upon recollection, I said, indeed I am afraid that we have left out 
<A NAME="342"></A>the greatest of them all.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>What is that? he asked.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Fortune, Cleinias, I replied; which all, even the most foolish, admit 
<A NAME="345"></A>to be the greatest of goods.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>On second thoughts, I added, how narrowly, O son of Axiochus, have 
<A NAME="348"></A>you and I escaped making a laughing-stock of ourselves to the 
<A NAME="349"></A>strangers.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>Why do you say so?
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>Why, because we have already spoken of good-fortune, and are but repeating 
<A NAME="352"></A>ourselves.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean?
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>I mean that there is something ridiculous in again putting forward 
<A NAME="355"></A>good-fortune, which has a place in the list already, and saying the same 
<A NAME="356"></A>thing twice over.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>He asked what was the meaning of this, and I replied: Surely wisdom 
<A NAME="358"></A>is good-fortune; even a child may know that.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>The simple-minded youth was amazed; and, observing his surprise, 
<A NAME="360"></A>I said to him: Do you not know, Cleinias, that flute-players are most fortunate 
<A NAME="361"></A>and successful in performing on the flute?
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>He assented.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>And are not the scribes most fortunate in writing and reading 
<A NAME="364"></A>letters?
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Amid the dangers of the sea, again, are any more fortunate on the whole 
<A NAME="367"></A>than wise pilots?
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>None, certainly.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>And if you were engaged in war, in whose company would you rather take 
<A NAME="370"></A>the risk-in company with a wise general, or with a foolish 
<A NAME="371"></A>one?
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>With a wise one.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>And if you were ill, whom would you rather have as a companion in a 
<A NAME="374"></A>dangerous illness-a wise physician, or an ignorant one?
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>A wise one.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>You think, I said, that to act with a wise man is more fortunate than 
<A NAME="377"></A>to act with an ignorant one?
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>He assented.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Then wisdom always makes men fortunate: for by wisdom no man would 
<A NAME="380"></A>ever err, and therefore he must act rightly and succeed, or his wisdom 
<A NAME="381"></A>would be wisdom no longer.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>We contrived at last, somehow or other, to agree in a general conclusion, 
<A NAME="383"></A>that he who had wisdom had no need of fortune. I then recalled to his mind 
<A NAME="384"></A>the previous state of the question. You remember, I said, our making the 
<A NAME="385"></A>admission that we should be happy and fortunate if many good things were 
<A NAME="386"></A>present with us?
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>He assented.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>And should we be happy by reason of the presence of good things, if 
<A NAME="389"></A>they profited us not, or if they profited us?
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR>If they profited us, he said.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>And would they profit us, if we only had them and did not use them? 
<A NAME="392"></A>For example, if we had a great deal of food and did not eat, or a great 
<A NAME="393"></A>deal of drink and did not drink, should we be profited?
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not, he said.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Or would an artisan, who had all the implements necessary for his work, 
<A NAME="396"></A>and did not use them, be any the better for the possession of them? For 
<A NAME="397"></A>example, would a carpenter be any the better for having all his tools and 
<A NAME="398"></A>plenty of wood, if he never worked?
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not, he said.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>And if a person had wealth and all the goods of which we were just 
<A NAME="401"></A>now speaking, and did not use them, would he be happy because he possessed 
<A NAME="402"></A>them?
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>No indeed, Socrates.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>Then, I said, a man who would be happy must not only have the good 
<A NAME="405"></A>things, but he must also use them; there is no advantage in merely having 
<A NAME="406"></A>them?
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Well, Cleinias, but if you have the use as well as the possession of 
<A NAME="409"></A>good things, is that sufficient to confer happiness?
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>Yes, in my opinion.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>And may a person use them either rightly or wrongly?
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>He must use them rightly.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>That is quite true, I said. And the wrong use of a thing is far worse 
<A NAME="414"></A>than the non-use; for the one is an evil, and the other is neither a good 
<A NAME="415"></A>nor an evil. You admit that?
<A NAME="416"></A><BR><BR>He assented.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Now in the working and use of wood, is not that which gives the right 
<A NAME="418"></A>use simply the knowledge of the carpenter?
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>Nothing else, he said.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>And surely, in the manufacture of vessels, knowledge is that which 
<A NAME="421"></A>gives the right way of making them?
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>He agreed.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>And in the use of the goods of which we spoke at first-wealth and health 
<A NAME="424"></A>and beauty, is not knowledge that which directs us to the right use of 
<A NAME="425"></A>them, and regulates our practice about them?
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>He assented.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Then in every possession and every use of a thing, knowledge is that 
<A NAME="428"></A>which gives a man not only good-fortune but success?
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>He again assented.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>And tell me, I said, O tell me, what do possessions profit a man, if 
<A NAME="431"></A>he have neither good sense nor wisdom? Would a man be better off, having 
<A NAME="432"></A>and doing many things without wisdom, or a few things with wisdom? Look 
<A NAME="433"></A>at the matter thus: If he did fewer things would he not make fewer mistakes? 
<A NAME="434"></A>if he made fewer mistakes would he not have fewer misfortunes? and if he 
<A NAME="435"></A>had fewer misfortunes would he not be less miserable?
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>And who would do least-a Poor man or a rich man?
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>A poor man.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>A weak man or a strong man?
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>A weak man.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>A noble man or a mean man?
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>A mean man.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>And a coward would do less than a courageous and temperate 
<A NAME="444"></A>man?
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>And an indolent man less than an active man?
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>He assented.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>And a slow man less than a quick; and one who had dull perceptions 
<A NAME="449"></A>of seeing and hearing less than one who had keen ones?
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>All this was mutually allowed by us.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Then, I said, Cleinias, the sum of the matter appears to be that the 
<A NAME="452"></A>goods of which we spoke before are not to be regarded as goods in themselves, 
<A NAME="453"></A>but the degree of good and evil in them depends on whether they are or 
<A NAME="454"></A>are not under the guidance of knowledge: under the guidance of ignorance, 
<A NAME="455"></A>they are greater evils than their opposites, inasmuch as they are more 
<A NAME="456"></A>able to minister to the evil principle which rules them; and when under 
<A NAME="457"></A>the guidance of wisdom and prudence, they are greater goods: but in themselves 
<A NAME="458"></A>are nothing?
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>That, he replied, is obvious.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>What then is the result of what has been said? Is not this the result-that 
<A NAME="461"></A>other things are indifferent, and that wisdom is the only good, and ignorance 
<A NAME="462"></A>the only evil?
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>He assented.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Let us consider a further point, I said: Seeing that all men desire 
<A NAME="465"></A>happiness, and happiness, as has been shown, is gained by a use, and a 
<A NAME="466"></A>right use, of the things of life, and the right use of them, and good fortune 
<A NAME="467"></A>in the use of them, is given by knowledge,-the inference is that everybody 
<A NAME="468"></A>ought by all means to try and make himself as wise as he 
<A NAME="469"></A>can?
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>And when a man thinks that he ought to obtain this treasure, far more 
<A NAME="472"></A>than money, from a father or a guardian or a friend or a suitor, whether 
<A NAME="473"></A>citizen or stranger-the eager desire and prayer to them that they would 
<A NAME="474"></A>impart wisdom to you, is not at all dishonourable, Cleinias; nor is any 
<A NAME="475"></A>one to be blamed for doing any honourable service or ministration to any 
<A NAME="476"></A>man, whether a lover or not, if his aim is to get wisdom. Do you agree? 
<A NAME="477"></A>I said.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, I quite agree, and think that you are 
<A NAME="479"></A>right.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Yes, I said, Cleinias, if only wisdom can be taught, and does not come 
<A NAME="481"></A>to man spontaneously; for this is a point which has still to be considered, 
<A NAME="482"></A>and is not yet agreed upon by you and me-
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>But I think, Socrates, that wisdom can be taught, he 
<A NAME="484"></A>said.
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Best of men, I said, I am delighted to hear you say so; and I am also 
<A NAME="486"></A>grateful to you for having saved me from a long and tiresome investigation 
<A NAME="487"></A>as to whether wisdom can be taught or not. But now, as you think that wisdom 
<A NAME="488"></A>can be taught, and that wisdom only can make a man happy and fortunate 
<A NAME="489"></A>will you not acknowledge that all of us ought to love wisdom, and you individually 
<A NAME="490"></A>will try to love her?
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, Socrates, he said; I will do my best.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>I was pleased at hearing this; and I turned to Dionysodorus and Euthydemus 
<A NAME="493"></A>and said: That is an example, clumsy and tedious I admit, of the sort of 
<A NAME="494"></A>exhortations which I would have you give; and I hope that one of you will 
<A NAME="495"></A>set forth what I have been saying in a more artistic style: or at least 
<A NAME="496"></A>take up the enquiry where I left off, and proceed to show the youth whether 
<A NAME="497"></A>he should have all knowledge; or whether there is one sort of knowledge 
<A NAME="498"></A>only which will make him good and happy, and what that is. For, as I was 
<A NAME="499"></A>saying at first, the improvement of this young man in virtue and wisdom 
<A NAME="500"></A>is a matter which we have very much at heart.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>Thus I spoke, Crito, and was all attention to what was coming. 
<A NAME="502"></A>I wanted to see how they would approach the question, and where they would 
<A NAME="503"></A>start in their exhortation to the young man that he should practise wisdom 
<A NAME="504"></A>and virtue. Dionysodorus, who was the elder, spoke first. Everybody's eyes 
<A NAME="505"></A>were directed towards him, perceiving that something wonderful might shortly 
<A NAME="506"></A>be expected. And certainly they were not far wrong; for the man, Crito, 
<A NAME="507"></A>began a remarkable discourse well worth hearing, and wonderfully persuasive 
<A NAME="508"></A>regarded as an exhortation to virtue.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>Tell me, he said, Socrates and the rest of you who say that you 
<A NAME="510"></A>want this young man to become wise, are you in jest or in real 
<A NAME="511"></A>earnest?
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>I was led by this to imagine that they fancied us to have been 
<A NAME="513"></A>jesting when we asked them to converse with the youth, and that this made 
<A NAME="514"></A>them jest and play, and being under this impression, I was the more decided 
<A NAME="515"></A>in saying that we were in profound earnest. Dionysodorus 
<A NAME="516"></A>said:
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>Reflect, Socrates; you may have to deny your 
<A NAME="518"></A>words.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>I have reflected, I said; and I shall never deny my 
<A NAME="520"></A>words.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Well, said he, and so you say that you wish Cleinias to become 
<A NAME="522"></A>wise?
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Undoubtedly.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>And he is not wise as yet?
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>At least his modesty will not allow him to say that he 
<A NAME="526"></A>is.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>You wish him, he said, to become wise and not, to be 
<A NAME="528"></A>ignorant?
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>That we do.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>You wish him to be what he is not, and no longer to be what he 
<A NAME="531"></A>is?
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>I was thrown into consternation at this.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Taking advantage of my consternation he added: You wish him no longer 
<A NAME="534"></A>to be what he is, which can only mean that you wish him to perish. Pretty 
<A NAME="535"></A>lovers and friends they must be who want their favourite not to be, or 
<A NAME="536"></A>to perish!
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>When Ctesippus heard this he got very angry (as a lover well might) 
<A NAME="538"></A>and said: Stranger of Thurii-if politeness would allow me I should say, 
<A NAME="539"></A>A plague upon you! What can make you tell such a lie about me and the others, 
<A NAME="540"></A>which I hardly like to repeat, as that I wish Cleinias to 
<A NAME="541"></A>perish?
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>Euthydemus replied: And do you think, Ctesippus, that it is possible 
<A NAME="543"></A>to tell a lie?
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR>Yes, said Ctesippus; I should be mad to say anything 
<A NAME="545"></A>else.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>And in telling a lie, do you tell the thing of which you speak or 
<A NAME="547"></A>not?
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR>You tell the thing of which you speak.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>And he who tells, tells that thing which he tells, and no 
<A NAME="550"></A>other?
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Yes, said Ctesippus.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>And that is a distinct thing apart from other things?
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>And he who says that thing says that which is?
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>And he who says that which is, says the truth. And therefore Dionysodorus, 
<A NAME="557"></A>if he says that which is, says the truth of you and no 
<A NAME="558"></A>lie.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>Yes, Euthydemus, said Ctesippus; but in saying this, he says what 
<A NAME="560"></A>is not.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR>Euthydemus answered: And that which is not is 
<A NAME="562"></A>not?
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>And that which is not is nowhere?
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Nowhere.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>And can any one do anything about that which has no existence, or do 
<A NAME="567"></A>to Cleinias that which is not and is nowhere?
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>I think not, said Ctesippus.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Well, but do rhetoricians, when they speak in the assembly, do 
<A NAME="570"></A>nothing?
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR>Nay, he said, they do something.
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>And doing is making?
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>And speaking is doing and making?
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>He agreed.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Then no one says that which is not, for in saying what is not he would 
<A NAME="577"></A>be doing something; and you have already acknowledged that no one can do 
<A NAME="578"></A>what is not. And therefore, upon your own showing, no one says what is 
<A NAME="579"></A>false; but if Dionysodorus says anything, he says what is true and what 
<A NAME="580"></A>is.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR>Yes, Euthydemus, said Ctesippus; but he speaks of things in a certain 
<A NAME="582"></A>way and manner, and not as they really are.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR>Why, Ctesippus, said Dionysodorus, do you mean to say that any 
<A NAME="584"></A>one speaks of things as they are?
<A NAME="585"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said-all gentlemen and truth-speaking 
<A NAME="586"></A>persons.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>And are not good things good, and evil things evil?
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>He assented.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>And you say that gentlemen speak of things as they 
<A NAME="590"></A>are?
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Then the good speak evil of evil things, if they speak of them as they 
<A NAME="593"></A>are?
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR>Yes, indeed, he said; and they speak evil of evil men. And if I 
<A NAME="595"></A>may give you a piece of advice, you had better take care that they do not 
<A NAME="596"></A>speak evil of you, since I can tell you that the good speak evil of the 
<A NAME="597"></A>evil.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>And do they speak great things of the great, rejoined Euthydemus, 
<A NAME="599"></A>and warm things of the warm?
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR>To be sure they do, said Ctesippus; and they speak coldly of the 
<A NAME="601"></A>insipid and cold dialectician.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR>You are abusive, Ctesippus, said Dionysodorus, you are 
<A NAME="603"></A>abusive!
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Indeed, I am not, Dionysodorus, he replied; for I love you and am giving 
<A NAME="605"></A>you friendly advice, and, if I could, would persuade you not like a boor 
<A NAME="606"></A>to say in my presence that I desire my beloved, whom I value above all 
<A NAME="607"></A>men, to perish.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>I saw that they were getting exasperated with one another, so I 
<A NAME="609"></A>made a joke with him and said: O Ctesippus, I think that we must allow 
<A NAME="610"></A>the strangers to use language in their own way, and not quarrel with them 
<A NAME="611"></A>about words, but be thankful for what they give us. If they know how to 
<A NAME="612"></A>destroy men in such a way as to make good and sensible men out of bad and 
<A NAME="613"></A>foolish ones-whether this is a discovery of their own, or whether they 
<A NAME="614"></A>have learned from some one else this new sort of death and destruction 
<A NAME="615"></A>which enables them to get rid of a bad man and turn him into a good one-if 
<A NAME="616"></A>they know this (and they do know this-at any rate they said just now that 
<A NAME="617"></A>this was the secret of their newly-discovered art)-let them, in their phraseology, 
<A NAME="618"></A>destroy the youth and make him wise, and all of us with him. But if you 
<A NAME="619"></A>young men do not like to trust yourselves with them, then fiat experimentum 
<A NAME="620"></A>in corpore senis; I will be the Carian on whom they shall operate. And 
<A NAME="621"></A>here I offer my old person to Dionysodorus; he may put me into the pot, 
<A NAME="622"></A>like Medea the Colchian, kill me, boil me, if he will only make me 
<A NAME="623"></A>good.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>Ctesippus said: And I, Socrates, am ready to commit myself to the 
<A NAME="625"></A>strangers; they may skin me alive, if they please (and I am pretty well 
<A NAME="626"></A>skinned by them already), if only my skin is made at last, not like that 
<A NAME="627"></A>of Marsyas, into a leathern bottle, but into a piece of virtue. And here 
<A NAME="628"></A>is Dionysodorus fancying that I am angry with him, when really I am not 
<A NAME="629"></A>angry at all; I do but contradict him when I think that he is speaking 
<A NAME="630"></A>improperly to me: and you must not confound abuse and contradiction, O 
<A NAME="631"></A>illustrious Dionysodorus; for they are quite different 
<A NAME="632"></A>things.
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>Contradiction! said Dionysodorus; why, there never was such a 
<A NAME="634"></A>thing.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>Certainly there is, he replied; there can be no question of that. Do 
<A NAME="636"></A>you, Dionysodorus, maintain that there is not?
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR>You will never prove to me, he said, that you have heard any one 
<A NAME="638"></A>contradicting any one else.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, said Ctesippus; then now you may hear me contradicting 
<A NAME="640"></A>Dionysodorus.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>Are you prepared to make that good?
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>Certainly, he said.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Well, have not all things words expressive of them?
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>Of their existence or of their non-existence?
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Of their existence.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Yes, Ctesippus, and we just now proved, as you may remember, that no 
<A NAME="648"></A>man could affirm a negative; for no one could affirm that which is 
<A NAME="649"></A>not.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>And what does that signify? said Ctesippus; you and I may contradict 
<A NAME="651"></A>all the same for that.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>But can we contradict one another, said Dionysodorus, when both 
<A NAME="653"></A>of us are describing the same thing? Then we must surely be speaking the 
<A NAME="654"></A>same thing?
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>He assented.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Or when neither of us is speaking of the same thing? For then neither 
<A NAME="657"></A>of us says a word about the thing at all?
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>He granted that proposition also.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>But when I describe something and you describe another thing, or I 
<A NAME="660"></A>say something and you say nothing-is there any contradiction? How can he 
<A NAME="661"></A>who speaks contradict him who speaks not?
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>Here Ctesippus was silent; and I in my astonishment said: What 
<A NAME="663"></A>do you mean, Dionysodorus? I have often heard, and have been amazed to 
<A NAME="664"></A>hear, this thesis of yours, which is maintained and employed by the disciples 
<A NAME="665"></A>of Protagoras, and others before them, and which to me appears to be quite 
<A NAME="666"></A>wonderful, and suicidal as well as destructive, and I think that I am most 
<A NAME="667"></A>likely to hear the truth about it from you. The dictum is that there is 
<A NAME="668"></A>no such thing as falsehood; a man must either say what is true or say nothing. 
<A NAME="669"></A>Is not that your position?
<A NAME="670"></A><BR><BR>He assented.
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>But if he cannot speak falsely, may he not think 
<A NAME="672"></A>falsely?
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>No, he cannot, he said.
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>Then there is no such thing as false opinion?
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>No, he said.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>Then there is no such thing as ignorance, or men who are ignorant; 
<A NAME="677"></A>for is not ignorance, if there be such a thing, a mistake of 
<A NAME="678"></A>fact?
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said.
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>And that is impossible?
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Impossible, he replied.
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Are you saying this as a paradox, Dionysodorus; or do you seriously 
<A NAME="683"></A>maintain no man to be ignorant?
<A NAME="684"></A><BR><BR>Refute me, he said.
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>But how can I refute you, if, as you say, to tell a falsehood is 
<A NAME="686"></A>impossible?
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR>Very true, said Euthydemus.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>Neither did I tell you just now to refute me, said Dionysodorus; for 
<A NAME="689"></A>how can I tell you to do that which is not?
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>O Euthydemus, I said, I have but a dull conception of these subtleties 
<A NAME="691"></A>and excellent devices of wisdom; I am afraid that I hardly understand them, 
<A NAME="692"></A>and you must forgive me therefore if I ask a very stupid question: if there 
<A NAME="693"></A>be no falsehood or false opinion or ignorance, there can be no such thing 
<A NAME="694"></A>as erroneous action, for a man cannot fail of acting as he is acting-that 
<A NAME="695"></A>is what you mean?
<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he replied.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>And now, I said, I will ask my stupid question: If there is no such 
<A NAME="698"></A>thing as error in deed, word, or thought, then what, in the name of goodness, 
<A NAME="699"></A>do you come hither to teach? And were you not just now saying that you 
<A NAME="700"></A>could teach virtue best of all men, to any one who was willing to 
<A NAME="701"></A>learn?
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>And are you such an old fool, Socrates, rejoined Dionysodorus, 
<A NAME="703"></A>that you bring up now what I said at first-and if I had said anything last 
<A NAME="704"></A>year, I suppose that you would bring that up too-but are non-plussed at 
<A NAME="705"></A>the words which I have just uttered?
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR>Why, I said, they are not easy to answer; for they are the words 
<A NAME="707"></A>of wise men: and indeed I know not what to make of this word "nonplussed," 
<A NAME="708"></A>which you used last: what do you mean by it, Dionysodorus? You must mean 
<A NAME="709"></A>that I cannot refute your argument. Tell me if the words have any other 
<A NAME="710"></A>sense.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR>No, he replied, they mean what you say. And now 
<A NAME="712"></A>answer.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>What, before you, Dionysodorus? I said.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Answer, said he.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>And is that fair?
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>Yes, quite fair, he said.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>Upon what principle? I said. I can only suppose that you are a very 
<A NAME="718"></A>wise man who comes to us in the character of a great logician, and who 
<A NAME="719"></A>knows when to answer and when not to answer-and now you will not open your 
<A NAME="720"></A>mouth at all, because you know that you ought not.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR>You prate, he said, instead of answering. But if, my good sir, 
<A NAME="722"></A>you admit that I am wise, answer as I tell you.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>I suppose that I must obey, for you are master. Put the 
<A NAME="724"></A>question.
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>Are the things which have sense alive or lifeless?
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>They are alive.
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>And do you know of any word which is alive?
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>I cannot say that I do.
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>Then why did you ask me what sense my words had?
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Why, because I was stupid and made a mistake. And yet, perhaps, I was 
<A NAME="731"></A>right after all in saying that words have a sense;-what do you say, wise 
<A NAME="732"></A>man? If I was not in error, even you will not refute me, and all your wisdom 
<A NAME="733"></A>will be non-plussed; but if I did fall into error, then again you are wrong 
<A NAME="734"></A>in saying that there is no error,-and this remark was made by you not quite 
<A NAME="735"></A>a year ago. I am inclined to think, however, Dionysodorus and Euthydemus, 
<A NAME="736"></A>that this argument lies where it was and is not very likely to advance: 
<A NAME="737"></A>even your skill in the subtleties of logic, which is really amazing, has 
<A NAME="738"></A>not found out the way of throwing another and not falling yourself, now 
<A NAME="739"></A>any more than of old.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR>Ctesippus said: Men of Chios, Thurii, or however and whatever you 
<A NAME="741"></A>call yourselves, I wonder at you, for you seem to have no objection to 
<A NAME="742"></A>talking nonsense.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR>Fearing that there would be high words, I again endeavoured to 
<A NAME="744"></A>soothe Ctesippus, and said to him: To you, Ctesippus, I must repeat what 
<A NAME="745"></A>I said before to Cleinias-that you do not understand the ways of these 
<A NAME="746"></A>philosophers from abroad. They are not serious, but, like the Egyptian 
<A NAME="747"></A>wizard, Proteus, they take different forms and deceive us by their enchantments: 
<A NAME="748"></A>and let us, like Menelaus, refuse to let them go until they show themselves 
<A NAME="749"></A>to us in earnest. When they begin to be in earnest their full beauty will 
<A NAME="750"></A>appear: let us then beg and entreat and beseech them to shine forth. And 
<A NAME="751"></A>I think that I had better once more exhibit the form in which I pray to 
<A NAME="752"></A>behold them; it might be a guide to them. I will go on therefore where 
<A NAME="753"></A>I left off, as well as I can, in the hope that I may touch their hearts 
<A NAME="754"></A>and move them to pity, and that when they see me deeply serious and interested, 
<A NAME="755"></A>they also may be serious. You, Cleinias, I said, shall remind me at what 
<A NAME="756"></A>point we left off. Did we not agree that philosophy should be studied? 
<A NAME="757"></A>and was not that our conclusion?
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he replied.
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>And philosophy is the acquisition of knowledge?
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Yes, he said.
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>And what knowledge ought we to acquire? May we not answer with absolute 
<A NAME="762"></A>truth-A knowledge which will do us good?
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said.
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>And should we be any the better if we went about having a knowledge 
<A NAME="765"></A>of the places where most gold was hidden in the earth?
<A NAME="766"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps we should, he said.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>But have we not already proved, I said, that we should be none the 
<A NAME="768"></A>better off, even if without trouble and digging all the gold which there 
<A NAME="769"></A>is in the earth were ours? And if we knew how to convert stones into gold, 
<A NAME="770"></A>the knowledge would be of no value to us, unless we also knew how to use 
<A NAME="771"></A>the gold? Do you not remember? I said.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR><BR>I quite remember, he said.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>Nor would any other knowledge, whether of money-making, or of medicine, 
<A NAME="774"></A>or of any other art which knows only how to make a thing, and not to use 
<A NAME="775"></A>it when made, be of any good to us. Am I not right?
<A NAME="776"></A><BR><BR>He agreed.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>And if there were a knowledge which was able to make men immortal, 
<A NAME="778"></A>without giving them the knowledge of the way to use the immortality, neither 
<A NAME="779"></A>would there be any use in that, if we may argue from the analogy of the 
<A NAME="780"></A>previous instances?
<A NAME="781"></A><BR><BR>To all this he agreed.
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>Then, my dear boy, I said, the knowledge which we want is one that 
<A NAME="783"></A>uses as well as makes?
<A NAME="784"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>And our desire is not to be skilful lyre-makers, or artists of that 
<A NAME="786"></A>sort-far otherwise; for with them the art which makes is one, and the art 
<A NAME="787"></A>which uses is another. Although they have to do with the same, they are 
<A NAME="788"></A>divided: for the art which makes and the art which plays on the lyre differ 
<A NAME="789"></A>widely from one another. Am I not right?
<A NAME="790"></A><BR><BR>He agreed.
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>And clearly we do not want the art of the flute-maker; this is only 
<A NAME="792"></A>another of the same sort?
<A NAME="793"></A><BR><BR>He assented.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>But suppose, I said, that we were to learn the art of making speeches-would 
<A NAME="795"></A>that be the art which would make us happy?
<A NAME="796"></A><BR><BR>I should say no, rejoined Cleinias.
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>And why should you say so? I asked.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>I see, he replied, that there are some composers of speeches who do 
<A NAME="799"></A>not know how to use the speeches which they make, just as the makers of 
<A NAME="800"></A>lyres do not know how to use the lyres; and also some who are of themselves 
<A NAME="801"></A>unable to compose speeches, but are able to use the speeches which the 
<A NAME="802"></A>others make for them; and this proves that the art of making speeches is 
<A NAME="803"></A>not the same as the art of using them.
<A NAME="804"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said; and I take your words to be a sufficient proof that 
<A NAME="805"></A>the art of making speeches is not one which will make a man happy. And 
<A NAME="806"></A>yet I did think that the art which we have so long been seeking might be 
<A NAME="807"></A>discovered in that direction; for the composers of speeches, whenever I 
<A NAME="808"></A>meet them, always appear to me to be very extraordinary men, Cleinias, 
<A NAME="809"></A>and their art is lofty and divine, and no wonder. For their art is a part 
<A NAME="810"></A>of the great art of enchantment, and hardly, if at all, inferior to it: 
<A NAME="811"></A>and whereas the art of the enchanter is a mode of charming snakes and spiders 
<A NAME="812"></A>and scorpions, and other monsters and pests, this art of theirs acts upon 
<A NAME="813"></A>dicasts and ecclesiasts and bodies of men, for the charming and pacifying 
<A NAME="814"></A>of them. Do you agree with me?
<A NAME="815"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, I think that you are quite right.
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>Whither then shall we go, I said, and to what art shall we have 
<A NAME="817"></A>recourse?
<A NAME="818"></A><BR><BR>I do not see my way, he said.
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>But I think that I do, I replied.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>And what is your notion? asked Cleinias.
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>I think that the art of the general is above all others the one of 
<A NAME="822"></A>which the possession is most likely to make a man happy.
<A NAME="823"></A><BR><BR>I do not think so, he said.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Why not? I said.
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>The art of the general is surely an art of hunting 
<A NAME="826"></A>mankind.
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>What of that? I said.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>Why, he said, no art of hunting extends beyond hunting and capturing; 
<A NAME="829"></A>and when the prey is taken the huntsman or fisherman cannot use it; but 
<A NAME="830"></A>they hand it over to the cook, and the geometricians and astronomers and 
<A NAME="831"></A>calculators (who all belong to the hunting class, for they do not make 
<A NAME="832"></A>their diagrams, but only find out that which was previously contained in 
<A NAME="833"></A>them)-they, I say, not being able to use but only to catch their prey, 
<A NAME="834"></A>hand over their inventions to the dialectician to be applied by him, if 
<A NAME="835"></A>they have any sense in them.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR><BR>Good, I said, fairest and wisest Cleinias. And is this 
<A NAME="837"></A>true?
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>Certainly, he said; just as a general when he takes a city or a camp 
<A NAME="839"></A>hands over his new acquisition to the statesman, for he does not know how 
<A NAME="840"></A>to use them himself; or as the quail-taker transfers the quails to the 
<A NAME="841"></A>keeper of them. If we are looking for the art which is to make us blessed, 
<A NAME="842"></A>and which is able to use that which it makes or takes, the art of the general 
<A NAME="843"></A>is not the one, and some other must be found.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> And do you mean, Socrates, that the youngster said 
<A NAME="845"></A>all this?
<A NAME="846"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Are you incredulous, Crito?
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> Indeed, I am; for if he did say so, then in my opinion 
<A NAME="848"></A>he needs neither Euthydemus nor any one else to be his 
<A NAME="849"></A>instructor.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Perhaps I may have forgotten, and Ctesippus was the 
<A NAME="851"></A>real answerer.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> Ctesippus! nonsense.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> All I know is that I heard these words, and that they 
<A NAME="854"></A>were not spoken either by Euthydemus or Dionysodorus. I dare say, my good 
<A NAME="855"></A>Crito, that they may have been spoken by some superior person: that I heard 
<A NAME="856"></A>them I am certain.
<A NAME="857"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> Yes, indeed, Socrates, by some one a good deal superior, 
<A NAME="858"></A>as I should be disposed to think. But did you carry the search any further, 
<A NAME="859"></A>and did you find the art which you were seeking?
<A NAME="860"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Find! my dear sir, no indeed. And we cut a poor figure; 
<A NAME="861"></A>we were like children after larks, always on the point of catching the 
<A NAME="862"></A>art, which was always getting away from us. But why should I repeat the 
<A NAME="863"></A>whole story? At last we came to the kingly art, and enquired whether that 
<A NAME="864"></A>gave and caused happiness, and then we got into a labyrinth, and when we 
<A NAME="865"></A>thought we were at the end, came out again at the beginning, having still 
<A NAME="866"></A>to seek as much as ever.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> How did that happen, Socrates?
<A NAME="868"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I will tell you; the kingly art was identified by us 
<A NAME="869"></A>with the political.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> Well, and what came of that?
<A NAME="871"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> To this royal or political art all the arts, including 
<A NAME="872"></A>the art of the general, seemed to render up the supremacy, that being the 
<A NAME="873"></A>only one which knew how to use what they produce. Here obviously was the 
<A NAME="874"></A>very art which we were seeking-the art which is the source of good government, 
<A NAME="875"></A>and which may be described, in the language of Aeschylus, as alone sitting 
<A NAME="876"></A>at the helm of the vessel of state, piloting and governing all things, 
<A NAME="877"></A>and utilizing them.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> And were you not right, Socrates?
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You shall judge, Crito, if you are willing to hear 
<A NAME="880"></A>what followed; for we resumed the enquiry, and a question of this sort 
<A NAME="881"></A>was asked: Does the kingly art, having this supreme authority, do anything 
<A NAME="882"></A>for us? To be sure, was the answer. And would not you, Crito, say the 
<A NAME="883"></A>same?
<A NAME="884"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> Yes, I should.
<A NAME="885"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And what would you say that the kingly art does? If 
<A NAME="886"></A>medicine were supposed to have supreme authority over the subordinate arts, 
<A NAME="887"></A>and I were to ask you a similar question about that, you would say-it produces 
<A NAME="888"></A>health?
<A NAME="889"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> I should.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And what of your own art of husbandry, supposing that 
<A NAME="891"></A>to have supreme authority over the subject arts-what does that do? Does 
<A NAME="892"></A>it not supply us with the fruits of the earth?
<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And what does the kingly art do when invested with 
<A NAME="895"></A>supreme power? Perhaps you may not be ready with an 
<A NAME="896"></A>answer?
<A NAME="897"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> Indeed I am not, Socrates.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> No more were we, Crito. But at any rate you know that 
<A NAME="899"></A>if this is the art which we were seeking, it ought to be 
<A NAME="900"></A>useful.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="902"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And surely it ought to do us some 
<A NAME="903"></A>good?
<A NAME="904"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> Certainly, Socrates.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And Cleinias and I had arrived at the conclusion that 
<A NAME="906"></A>knowledge of some kind is the only good.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> Yes, that was what you were saying.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> All the other results of politics, and they are many, 
<A NAME="909"></A>as for example, wealth, freedom, tranquillity, were neither good nor evil 
<A NAME="910"></A>in themselves; but the political science ought to make us wise, and impart 
<A NAME="911"></A>knowledge to us, if that is the science which is likely to do us good, 
<A NAME="912"></A>and make us happy.
<A NAME="913"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> Yes; that was the conclusion at which you had arrived, 
<A NAME="914"></A>according to your report of the conversation.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And does the kingly art make men wise and 
<A NAME="916"></A>good?
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> Why not, Socrates?
<A NAME="918"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What, all men, and in every respect? and teach them 
<A NAME="919"></A>all the arts,-carpentering, and cobbling, and the rest of 
<A NAME="920"></A>them?
<A NAME="921"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> I think not, Socrates.
<A NAME="922"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But then what is this knowledge, and what are we to 
<A NAME="923"></A>do with it? For it is not the source of any works which are neither good 
<A NAME="924"></A>nor evil, and gives no knowledge, but the knowledge of itself; what then 
<A NAME="925"></A>can it be, and what are we to do with it? Shall we say, Crito, that it 
<A NAME="926"></A>is the knowledge by which we are to make other men good?
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And in what will they be good and useful? Shall we 
<A NAME="929"></A>repeat that they will make others good, and that these others will make 
<A NAME="930"></A>others again, without ever determining in what they are to be good; for 
<A NAME="931"></A>we have put aside the results of politics, as they are called. This is 
<A NAME="932"></A>the old, old song over again; and we are just as far as ever, if not farther, 
<A NAME="933"></A>from the knowledge of the art or science of happiness.
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR>.Cri. Indeed, Socrates, you do appear to have got into a great 
<A NAME="935"></A>perplexity.
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Thereupon, Crito, seeing that I was on the point of 
<A NAME="937"></A>shipwreck, I lifted up my voice, and earnestly entreated and called upon 
<A NAME="938"></A>the strangers to save me and the youth from the whirlpool of the argument; 
<A NAME="939"></A>they were our Castor and Pollux, I said, and they should be serious, and 
<A NAME="940"></A>show us in sober earnest what that knowledge was which would enable us 
<A NAME="941"></A>to pass the rest of our lives in happiness.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR><BR><B>Cri.</B> And did Euthydemus show you this 
<A NAME="943"></A>knowledge?
<A NAME="944"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, indeed; he proceeded in a lofty strain to the 
<A NAME="945"></A>following effect: Would you rather, Socrates, said he, that I should show 
<A NAME="946"></A>you this knowledge about which you have been doubting, or shall I prove 
<A NAME="947"></A>that you already have it?
<A NAME="948"></A><BR><BR>What, I said, are you blessed with such a power as 
<A NAME="949"></A>this?
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>Indeed I am.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>Then I would much rather that you should prove me to have such a knowledge; 
<A NAME="952"></A>at my time of life that will be more agreeable than having to 
<A NAME="953"></A>learn.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR><BR>Then tell me, he said, do you know anything?
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>Yes, I said, I know many things, but not anything of much 
<A NAME="956"></A>importance.
<A NAME="957"></A><BR><BR>That will do, he said: And would you admit that anything is what 
<A NAME="958"></A>it is, and at the same time is not what it is?
<A NAME="959"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>And did you not say that you knew something?
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>I did.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>If you know, you are knowing.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>Certainly, of the knowledge which I have.
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>That makes no difference;-and must you not, if you are knowing, know 
<A NAME="965"></A>all things?
<A NAME="966"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not, I said, for there are many other things which I 
<A NAME="967"></A>do not know.
<A NAME="968"></A><BR><BR>And if you do not know, you are not knowing.
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>Yes, friend, of that which I do not know.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>Still you are not knowing, and you said just now that you were knowing; 
<A NAME="971"></A>and therefore you are and are not at the same time, and in reference to 
<A NAME="972"></A>the same things.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR><BR>A pretty clatter, as men say, Euthydemus, this of yours! and will 
<A NAME="974"></A>you explain how I possess that knowledge for which we were seeking? Do 
<A NAME="975"></A>you mean to say that the same thing cannot be and also not be; and therefore, 
<A NAME="976"></A>since I know one thing, that I know all, for I cannot be knowing and not 
<A NAME="977"></A>knowing at the same time, and if I know all things, then I must have the 
<A NAME="978"></A>knowledge for which we are seeking-May I assume this to be your ingenious 
<A NAME="979"></A>notion?
<A NAME="980"></A><BR><BR>Out of your own mouth, Socrates, you are convicted, he 
<A NAME="981"></A>said.
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>Well, but, Euthydemus, I said, has that never happened to you? for 
<A NAME="983"></A>if I am only in the same case with you and our beloved Dionysodorus, I 
<A NAME="984"></A>cannot complain. Tell me, then, you two, do you not know some things, and 
<A NAME="985"></A>not know others?
<A NAME="986"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not, Socrates, said Dionysodorus.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>What do you mean, I said; do you know nothing?
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>Nay, he replied, we do know something.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>Then, I said, you know all things, if you know anything?
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>Yes, all things, he said; and that is as true of you as of 
<A NAME="991"></A>us.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>O, indeed, I said, what a wonderful thing, and what a great blessing! 
<A NAME="993"></A>And do all other men know all things or nothing?
<A NAME="994"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he replied; they cannot know some things, and not know 
<A NAME="995"></A>others, and be at the same time knowing and not knowing.
<A NAME="996"></A><BR><BR>Then what is the inference? I said.
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>They all know all things, he replied, if they know one 
<A NAME="998"></A>thing.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>O heavens, Dionysodorus, I said, I see now that you are in earnest; 
<A NAME="1000"></A>hardly have I got you to that point. And do you really and truly know all 
<A NAME="1001"></A>things, including carpentering and leather cutting?
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said.
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>And do you know stitching?
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>Yes, by the gods, we do, and cobbling, too.
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>And do you know things such as the numbers of the stars and of the 
<A NAME="1006"></A>sand?
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR><BR>Certainly; did you think we should say no to 
<A NAME="1008"></A>that?
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>By Zeus, said Ctesippus, interrupting, I only wish that you would give 
<A NAME="1010"></A>me some proof which would enable me to know whether you speak 
<A NAME="1011"></A>truly.
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR><BR>What proof shall I give you? he said.
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>Will you tell me how many teeth Euthydemus has? and Euthydemus shall 
<A NAME="1014"></A>tell how many teeth you have.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR><BR>Will you not take our word that we know all 
<A NAME="1016"></A>things?
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>Certainly not, said Ctesippus: you must further tell us this one thing, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>and then we shall know that you are speak the truth; if you tell us the 
<A NAME="1019"></A>number, and we count them, and you are found to be right, we will believe 
<A NAME="1020"></A>the rest. They fancied that Ctesippus was making game of them, and they 
<A NAME="1021"></A>refused, and they would only say in answer to each of his questions, that 
<A NAME="1022"></A>they knew all things. For at last Ctesippus began to throw off all restraint; 
<A NAME="1023"></A>no question in fact was too bad for him; he would ask them if they knew 
<A NAME="1024"></A>the foulest things, and they, like wild boars, came rushing on his blows, 
<A NAME="1025"></A>and fearlessly replied that they did. At last, Crito, I too was carried 
<A NAME="1026"></A>away by my incredulity, and asked Euthydemus whether Dionysodorus could 
<A NAME="1027"></A>dance.
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he replied.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>And can he vault among swords, and turn upon a wheel, at his age? has 
<A NAME="1030"></A>he got to such a height of skill as that?
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR><BR>He can do anything, he said.
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>And did you always know this?
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>Always, he said.
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>When you were children, and at your birth?
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>They both said that they did.
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>This we could not believe. And Euthydemus said: You are incredulous, 
<A NAME="1037"></A>Socrates.
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said, and I might well be incredulous, if I did not know 
<A NAME="1039"></A>you to be wise men.
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR><BR>But if you will answer, he said, I will make you confess to similar 
<A NAME="1041"></A>marvels.
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR><BR>Well, I said, there is nothing that I should like better than to 
<A NAME="1043"></A>be self-convicted of this, for if I am really a wise man, which I never 
<A NAME="1044"></A>knew before, and you will prove to me that I know and have always known 
<A NAME="1045"></A>all things, nothing in life would be a greater gain to 
<A NAME="1046"></A>me.
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR><BR>Answer then, he said.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>Ask, I said, and I will answer.
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>Do you know something, Socrates, or nothing?
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>Something, I said.
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>And do you know with what you know, or with something 
<A NAME="1052"></A>else?
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>With what I know; and I suppose that you mean with my 
<A NAME="1054"></A>soul?
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>Are you not ashamed, Socrates, of asking a question when you are asked 
<A NAME="1056"></A>one?
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR><BR>Well, I said; but then what am I to do? for I will do whatever 
<A NAME="1058"></A>you bid; when I do not know what you are asking, you tell me to answer 
<A NAME="1059"></A>nevertheless, and not to ask again.
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR><BR>Why, you surely have some notion of my meaning, he 
<A NAME="1061"></A>said.
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>Yes, I replied.
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>Well, then, answer according to your notion of my 
<A NAME="1064"></A>meaning.
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>Yes, I said; but if the question which you ask in one sense is understood 
<A NAME="1066"></A>and answered by me in another, will that please you-if I answer what is 
<A NAME="1067"></A>not to the point?
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR><BR>That will please me very well; but will not please you equally 
<A NAME="1069"></A>well, as I imagine.
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR><BR>I certainly will not answer unless I understand you, I 
<A NAME="1071"></A>said.
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>You will not answer, he said, according to your view of the meaning, 
<A NAME="1073"></A>because you will be prating, and are an ancient.
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR><BR>Now I saw that he was getting angry with me for drawing distinctions, 
<A NAME="1075"></A>when he wanted to catch me in his springes of words. And I remembered that 
<A NAME="1076"></A>Connus was always angry with me when I opposed him, and then he neglected 
<A NAME="1077"></A>me, because he thought that I was stupid; and as I was intending to go 
<A NAME="1078"></A>to Euthydemus as a pupil, I reflected that I had better let him have his 
<A NAME="1079"></A>way, as he might think me a blockhead, and refuse to take me. So I said: 
<A NAME="1080"></A>You are a far better dialectician than myself, Euthydemus, for I have never 
<A NAME="1081"></A>made a profession of the art, and therefore do as you say; ask your questions 
<A NAME="1082"></A>once more, and I will answer.
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR><BR>Answer then, he said, again, whether you know what you know with 
<A NAME="1084"></A>something, or with nothing.
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said; I know with my soul.
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>The man will answer more than the question; for I did not ask you, 
<A NAME="1087"></A>he said, with what you know, but whether you know with 
<A NAME="1088"></A>something.
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR><BR>Again I replied, Through ignorance I have answered too much, but 
<A NAME="1090"></A>I hope that you will forgive me. And now I will answer simply that I always 
<A NAME="1091"></A>know what I know with something.
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR><BR>And is that something, he rejoined, always the same, or sometimes 
<A NAME="1093"></A>one thing, and sometimes another thing?
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR><BR>Always, I replied, when I know, I know with 
<A NAME="1095"></A>this.
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>Will you not cease adding to your answers?
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>My fear is that this word "always" may get us into 
<A NAME="1098"></A>trouble.
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>You, perhaps, but certainly not us. And now answer: Do you always know 
<A NAME="1100"></A>with this?
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR><BR>Always; since I am required to withdraw the words "when I 
<A NAME="1102"></A>know."
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>You always know with this, or, always knowing, do you know some things 
<A NAME="1104"></A>with this, and some things with something else, or do you know all things 
<A NAME="1105"></A>with this?
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR><BR>All that I know, I replied, I know with this.
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>There again, Socrates, he said, the addition is 
<A NAME="1108"></A>superfluous.
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>Well, then, I said, I will take away the words that I 
<A NAME="1110"></A>know."
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>Nay, take nothing away; I desire no favours of you; but let me ask: 
<A NAME="1112"></A>Would you be able to know all things, if you did not know all 
<A NAME="1113"></A>things?
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR><BR>Quite impossible.
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>And now, he said, you may add on whatever you like, for you confess 
<A NAME="1116"></A>that you know all things.
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR><BR>I suppose that is true, I said, if my qualification implied in 
<A NAME="1118"></A>the words "that I know" is not allowed to stand; and so I do know all 
<A NAME="1119"></A>things.
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR><BR>And have you not admitted that you always know all things with 
<A NAME="1121"></A>that which you know, whether you make the addition of "when you know them" 
<A NAME="1122"></A>or not? for you have acknowledged that you have always and at once known 
<A NAME="1123"></A>all things, that is to say, when you were a child, and at your birth, and 
<A NAME="1124"></A>when you were growing up, and before you were born, and before the heaven 
<A NAME="1125"></A>and earth existed, you knew all things if you always know them; and I swear 
<A NAME="1126"></A>that you shall always continue to know all things, if I am of the mind 
<A NAME="1127"></A>to make you.
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR><BR>But I hope that you will be of that mind, reverend Euthydemus, 
<A NAME="1129"></A>I said, if you are really speaking the truth, and yet I a little doubt 
<A NAME="1130"></A>your power to make good your words unless you have the help of your brother 
<A NAME="1131"></A>Dionysodorus; then you may do it. Tell me now, both of you, for although 
<A NAME="1132"></A>in the main I cannot doubt that I really do know all things, when I am 
<A NAME="1133"></A>told so by men of your prodigious wisdom-how can I say that I know such 
<A NAME="1134"></A>things, Euthydemus, as that the good are unjust; come, do I know that or 
<A NAME="1135"></A>not?
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, you know that.
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>What do I know?
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR>That the good are not unjust.
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>Quite true, I said; and that I have always known; but the question 
<A NAME="1140"></A>is, where did I learn that the good are unjust?
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR><BR>Nowhere, said Dionysodorus.
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>Then, I said, I do not know this.
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>You are ruining the argument, said Euthydemus to Dionysodorus; he will 
<A NAME="1144"></A>be proved not to know, and then after all he will be knowing and not knowing 
<A NAME="1145"></A>at the same time.
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR><BR>Dionysodorus blushed.
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>I turned to the other, and said, What do you think, Euthydemus? Does 
<A NAME="1148"></A>not your omniscient brother appear to you to have made a 
<A NAME="1149"></A>mistake?
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR><BR>What, replied Dionysodorus in a moment; am I the brother of 
<A NAME="1151"></A>Euthydemus?
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR><BR>Thereupon I said, Please not to interrupt, my good friend, or prevent 
<A NAME="1153"></A>Euthydemus from proving to me that I know the good to be unjust; such a 
<A NAME="1154"></A>lesson you might at least allow me to learn.
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR><BR>You are running away, Socrates, said Dionysodorus, and refusing 
<A NAME="1156"></A>to answer.
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR><BR>No wonder, I said, for I am not a match for one of you, and a fortiori 
<A NAME="1158"></A>I must run away from two. I am no Heracles; and even Heracles could not 
<A NAME="1159"></A>fight against the Hydra, who was a she-Sophist, and had the wit to shoot 
<A NAME="1160"></A>up many new heads when one of them was cut off; especially when he saw 
<A NAME="1161"></A>a second monster of a sea-crab, who was also a Sophist, and appeared to 
<A NAME="1162"></A>have newly arrived from a sea-voyage, bearing down upon him from the left, 
<A NAME="1163"></A>opening his mouth and biting. When the monster was growing troublesome 
<A NAME="1164"></A>he called Iolaus, his nephew, to his help, who ably succoured him; but 
<A NAME="1165"></A>if my Iolaus, who is my brother Patrocles [the statuary], were to come, 
<A NAME="1166"></A>he would only make a bad business worse.
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR><BR>And now that you have delivered yourself of this strain, said Dionysodorus, 
<A NAME="1168"></A>will you inform me whether Iolaus was the nephew of Heracles any more than 
<A NAME="1169"></A>he is yours?
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR><BR>I suppose that I had best answer you, Dionysodorus, I said, for 
<A NAME="1171"></A>you will insist on asking that I pretty well know-out of envy, in order 
<A NAME="1172"></A>to prevent me from learning the wisdom of Euthydemus.
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR><BR>Then answer me, he said.
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR>Well then, I said, I can only reply that Iolaus was not my nephew at 
<A NAME="1175"></A>all, but the nephew of Heracles; and his father was not my brother Patrocles, 
<A NAME="1176"></A>but Iphicles, who has a name rather like his, and was the brother of 
<A NAME="1177"></A>Heracles.
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR><BR>And is Patrocles, he said, your brother?
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR>Yes, I said, he is my half-brother, the son of my mother, but not of 
<A NAME="1180"></A>my father.
<A NAME="1181"></A><BR><BR>Then he is and is not your brother.
<A NAME="1182"></A><BR>Not by the same father, my good man, I said, for Chaeredemus was his 
<A NAME="1183"></A>father, and mine was Sophroniscus.
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR><BR>And was Sophroniscus a father, and Chaeredemus 
<A NAME="1185"></A>also?
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>Yes, I said; the former was my father, and the latter 
<A NAME="1187"></A>his.
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR>Then, he said, Chaeredemus is not a father.
<A NAME="1189"></A><BR>He is not my father, I said.
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR>But can a father be other than a father? or are you the same as a 
<A NAME="1191"></A>stone?
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR><BR>I certainly do not think that I am a stone, I said, though I am 
<A NAME="1193"></A>afraid that you may prove me to be one.
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR><BR>Are you not other than a stone?
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR>I am.
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR>And being other than a stone, you are not a stone; and being other 
<A NAME="1197"></A>than gold, you are not gold?
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="1199"></A><BR>And so Chaeredemus, he said, being other than a father, is not a 
<A NAME="1200"></A>father?
<A NAME="1201"></A><BR><BR>I suppose that he is not a father, I replied.
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR>For if, said Euthydemus, taking up the argument, Chaeredemus is a father, 
<A NAME="1203"></A>then Sophroniscus, being other than a father, is not a father; and you, 
<A NAME="1204"></A>Socrates, are without a father.
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR><BR>Ctesippus, here taking up the argument, said: And is not your father 
<A NAME="1206"></A>in the same case, for he is other than my father?
<A NAME="1207"></A><BR><BR>Assuredly not, said Euthydemus.
<A NAME="1208"></A><BR>Then he is the same?
<A NAME="1209"></A><BR>He is the same.
<A NAME="1210"></A><BR>I cannot say that I like the connection; but is he only my father, 
<A NAME="1211"></A>Euthydemus, or is he the father of all other men?
<A NAME="1212"></A><BR><BR>Of all other men, he replied. Do you suppose the same person to 
<A NAME="1213"></A>be a father and not a father?
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, I did so imagine, said Ctesippus.
<A NAME="1215"></A><BR>And do you suppose that gold is not gold, or that a man is not a 
<A NAME="1216"></A>man?
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR><BR>They are not "in pari materia," Euthydemus, said Ctesippus, and 
<A NAME="1218"></A>you had better take care, for it is monstrous to suppose that your father 
<A NAME="1219"></A>is the father of all.
<A NAME="1220"></A><BR><BR>But he is, he replied.
<A NAME="1221"></A><BR>What, of men only, said Ctesippus, or of horses and of all other 
<A NAME="1222"></A>animals?
<A NAME="1223"></A><BR><BR>Of all, he said.
<A NAME="1224"></A><BR>And your mother, too, is the mother of all?
<A NAME="1225"></A><BR>Yes, our mother too.
<A NAME="1226"></A><BR>Yes; and your mother has a progeny of sea-urchins 
<A NAME="1227"></A>then?
<A NAME="1228"></A><BR>Yes; and yours, he said.
<A NAME="1229"></A><BR>And gudgeons and puppies and pigs are your brothers?
<A NAME="1230"></A><BR>And yours too.
<A NAME="1231"></A><BR>And your papa is a dog?
<A NAME="1232"></A><BR>And so is yours, he said.
<A NAME="1233"></A><BR>If you will answer my questions, said Dionysodorus, I will soon extract 
<A NAME="1234"></A>the same admissions from you, Ctesippus. You say that you have a 
<A NAME="1235"></A>dog.
<A NAME="1236"></A><BR><BR>Yes, a villain of a one, said Ctesippus.
<A NAME="1237"></A><BR>And he has puppies?
<A NAME="1238"></A><BR>Yes, and they are very like himself.
<A NAME="1239"></A><BR>And the dog is the father of them?
<A NAME="1240"></A><BR>Yes, he said, I certainly saw him and the mother of the puppies come 
<A NAME="1241"></A>together.
<A NAME="1242"></A><BR><BR>And is he not yours?
<A NAME="1243"></A><BR>To be sure he is.
<A NAME="1244"></A><BR>Then he is a father, and he is yours; ergo, he is your father, and 
<A NAME="1245"></A>the puppies are your brothers.
<A NAME="1246"></A><BR><BR>Let me ask you one little question more, said Dionysodorus, quickly 
<A NAME="1247"></A>interposing, in order that Ctesippus might not get in his word: You beat 
<A NAME="1248"></A>this dog?
<A NAME="1249"></A><BR><BR>Ctesippus said, laughing, Indeed I do; and I only wish that I could 
<A NAME="1250"></A>beat you instead of him.
<A NAME="1251"></A><BR><BR>Then you beat your father, he said.
<A NAME="1252"></A><BR>I should have far more reason to beat yours, said Ctesippus; what could 
<A NAME="1253"></A>he have been thinking of when he begat such wise sons? much good has this 
<A NAME="1254"></A>father of you and your brethren the puppies got out of this wisdom of 
<A NAME="1255"></A>yours.
<A NAME="1256"></A><BR><BR>But neither he nor you, Ctesippus, have any need of much 
<A NAME="1257"></A>good.
<A NAME="1258"></A><BR>And have you no need, Euthydemus? he said.
<A NAME="1259"></A><BR>Neither I nor any other man; for tell me now, Ctesippus, if you think 
<A NAME="1260"></A>it good or evil for a man who is sick to drink medicine when he wants it; 
<A NAME="1261"></A>or to go to war armed rather than unarmed.
<A NAME="1262"></A><BR><BR>Good, I say. And yet I know that I am going to be caught in one 
<A NAME="1263"></A>of your charming puzzles.
<A NAME="1264"></A><BR><BR>That, he replied, you will discover, if you answer; since you admit 
<A NAME="1265"></A>medicine to be good for a man to drink, when wanted, must it not be good 
<A NAME="1266"></A>for him to drink as much as possible; when he takes his medicine, a cartload 
<A NAME="1267"></A>of hellebore will not be too much for him?
<A NAME="1268"></A><BR><BR>Ctesippus said: Quite so, Euthydemus, that is to say, if he who 
<A NAME="1269"></A>drinks is as big as the statue of Delphi.
<A NAME="1270"></A><BR><BR>And seeing that in war to have arms is a good thing, he ought to 
<A NAME="1271"></A>have as many spears and shields as possible?
<A NAME="1272"></A><BR><BR>Very true, said Ctesippus; and do you think, Euthydemus, that he 
<A NAME="1273"></A>ought to have one shield only, and one spear?
<A NAME="1274"></A><BR><BR>I do.
<A NAME="1275"></A><BR>And would you arm Geryon and Briarcus in that way? Considering that 
<A NAME="1276"></A>you and your companion fight in armour, I thought that you would have known 
<A NAME="1277"></A>better.... Here Euthydemus held his peace, but Dionysodorus returned to 
<A NAME="1278"></A>the previous answer of Ctesippus and said:-
<A NAME="1279"></A><BR><BR>Do you not think that the possession of gold is a good 
<A NAME="1280"></A>thing?
<A NAME="1281"></A><BR>Yes, said Ctesippus, and the more the better.
<A NAME="1282"></A><BR>And to have money everywhere and always is a good?
<A NAME="1283"></A><BR>Certain a great good, he said.
<A NAME="1284"></A><BR>And you admit gold to be a good?
<A NAME="1285"></A><BR>Certainly, he replied.
<A NAME="1286"></A><BR>And ought not a man then to have gold everywhere and always, and as 
<A NAME="1287"></A>much as possible in himself, and may he not be deemed the happiest of men 
<A NAME="1288"></A>who has three talents of gold in his belly, and a talent in his pate, and 
<A NAME="1289"></A>a stater of gold in either eye?
<A NAME="1290"></A><BR><BR>Yes, Euthydemus, said Ctesippus; and the Scythians reckon those 
<A NAME="1291"></A>who have gold in their own skulls to be the happiest and bravest of men 
<A NAME="1292"></A>(that is only another instance of your manner of speaking about the dog 
<A NAME="1293"></A>and father), and what is still more extraordinary, they drink out of their 
<A NAME="1294"></A>own skulls gilt and see the inside of them, and hold their own head in 
<A NAME="1295"></A>their hands.
<A NAME="1296"></A><BR><BR>And do the Scythians and others see that which has the quality 
<A NAME="1297"></A>of vision, or that which has not? said Euthydemus.
<A NAME="1298"></A><BR><BR>That which has the quality of vision clearly.
<A NAME="1299"></A><BR>And you also see that which has the quality Of vision? he 
<A NAME="1300"></A>said.
<A NAME="1301"></A><BR>Yes, I do.
<A NAME="1302"></A><BR>Then do you see our garments?
<A NAME="1303"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1304"></A><BR>Then our garments have the quality of vision.
<A NAME="1305"></A><BR>They can see to any extent, said Ctesippus.
<A NAME="1306"></A><BR>What can they see?
<A NAME="1307"></A><BR>Nothing; but you, my sweet man, may perhaps imagine that they do not 
<A NAME="1308"></A>see; and certainly, Euthydemus, you do seem to me to have been caught napping 
<A NAME="1309"></A>when you were not asleep, and that if it be possible to speak and say nothing-you 
<A NAME="1310"></A>are doing so.
<A NAME="1311"></A><BR><BR>And may there not be a silence of the speaker? said 
<A NAME="1312"></A>Dionysodorus.
<A NAME="1313"></A><BR>Impossible, said Ctesippus.
<A NAME="1314"></A><BR>Or a speaking of the silent?
<A NAME="1315"></A><BR>That is still more impossible, he said.
<A NAME="1316"></A><BR>But when you speak of stones, wood, iron bars, do you not speak of 
<A NAME="1317"></A>the silent?
<A NAME="1318"></A><BR><BR>Not when I pass a smithy; for then the iron bars make a tremendous 
<A NAME="1319"></A>noise and outcry if they are touched: so that here your wisdom is strangely 
<A NAME="1320"></A>mistaken, please, however, to tell me how you can be silent when speaking 
<A NAME="1321"></A>(I thought that Ctesippus was put upon his mettle because Cleinias was 
<A NAME="1322"></A>present).
<A NAME="1323"></A><BR><BR>When you are silent, said Euthydemus, is there not a silence of 
<A NAME="1324"></A>all things?
<A NAME="1325"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said.
<A NAME="1326"></A><BR>But if speaking things are included in all things, then the speaking 
<A NAME="1327"></A>are silent.
<A NAME="1328"></A><BR><BR>What, said Ctesippus; then all things are not 
<A NAME="1329"></A>silent?
<A NAME="1330"></A><BR>Certainly not, said Euthydemus.
<A NAME="1331"></A><BR>Then, my good friend, do they all speak?
<A NAME="1332"></A><BR>Yes; those which speak.
<A NAME="1333"></A><BR>Nay, said Ctesippus, but the question which I ask is whether all things 
<A NAME="1334"></A>are silent or speak?
<A NAME="1335"></A><BR><BR>Neither and both, said Dionysodorus, quickly interposing; I am 
<A NAME="1336"></A>sure that you will be "nonplussed" at that answer.
<A NAME="1337"></A><BR><BR>Here Ctesippus, as his manner was, burst into a roar of laughter; 
<A NAME="1338"></A>he said, That brother of yours, Euthydemus, has got into a dilemma; all 
<A NAME="1339"></A>is over with him. This delighted Cleinias, whose laughter made Ctesippus 
<A NAME="1340"></A>ten times as uproarious; but I cannot help thinking that the rogue must 
<A NAME="1341"></A>have picked up this answer from them; for there has been no wisdom like 
<A NAME="1342"></A>theirs in our time. Why do you laugh, Cleinias, I said, at such solemn 
<A NAME="1343"></A>and beautiful things?
<A NAME="1344"></A><BR><BR>Why, Socrates, said Dionysodorus, did you ever see a beautiful 
<A NAME="1345"></A>thing?
<A NAME="1346"></A><BR><BR>Yes, Dionysodorus, I replied, I have seen many.
<A NAME="1347"></A><BR>Were they other than the beautiful, or the same as the 
<A NAME="1348"></A>beautiful?
<A NAME="1349"></A><BR>Now I was in a great quandary at having to answer this question, and 
<A NAME="1350"></A>I thought that I was rightly served for having opened my mouth at all: 
<A NAME="1351"></A>I said however, They are not the same as absolute beauty, but they have 
<A NAME="1352"></A>beauty present with each of them.
<A NAME="1353"></A><BR><BR>And are you an ox because an ox is present with you, or are you 
<A NAME="1354"></A>Dionysodorus, because Dionysodorus is present with you?
<A NAME="1355"></A><BR><BR>God forbid, I replied.
<A NAME="1356"></A><BR>But how, he said, by reason of one thing being present with another, 
<A NAME="1357"></A>will one thing be another?
<A NAME="1358"></A><BR><BR>Is that your difficulty? I said. For I was beginning to imitate 
<A NAME="1359"></A>their skill, on which my heart was set.
<A NAME="1360"></A><BR
