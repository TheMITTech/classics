<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Next to all the matters which have preceded in the natural order of legislation 
<A NAME="11"></A>will come suits of law. Of suits those which relate to agriculture have 
<A NAME="12"></A>been already described, but the more important have not been described. 
<A NAME="13"></A>Having mentioned them severally under their usual names, we will proceed 
<A NAME="14"></A>to say what punishments are to be inflicted for each offence, and who are 
<A NAME="15"></A>to be the judges of them.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR><B>Cleinias.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Athenian Stranger. There is a sense of disgrace in legislating, as 
<A NAME="18"></A>we are about to do, for all the details of crime in a state which, as we 
<A NAME="19"></A>say, is to be well regulated and will be perfectly adapted to the practice 
<A NAME="20"></A>of virtue. To assume that in such a state there will arise some one who 
<A NAME="21"></A>will be guilty of crimes as heinous as any which are ever perpetrated in 
<A NAME="22"></A>other states, and that we must legislate for him by anticipation, and threaten 
<A NAME="23"></A>and make laws against him if he should arise, in order to deter him, and 
<A NAME="24"></A>punish his acts, under the idea that he will arise-this, as I was saying, 
<A NAME="25"></A>is in a manner disgraceful. Yet seeing that we are not like the ancient 
<A NAME="26"></A>legislators, who gave laws to heroes and sons of gods, being, according 
<A NAME="27"></A>to the popular belief, themselves the offspring of the gods, and legislating 
<A NAME="28"></A>for others, who were also the children of divine parents, but that we are 
<A NAME="29"></A>only men who are legislating for the sons of men, there is no uncharitableness 
<A NAME="30"></A>in apprehending that some one of our citizens may be like a seed which 
<A NAME="31"></A>has touched the ox's horn, having a heart so hard that it cannot be softened 
<A NAME="32"></A>any more than those seeds can be softened by fire. Among our citizens there 
<A NAME="33"></A>may be those who cannot be subdued by all the strength of the laws; and 
<A NAME="34"></A>for their sake, though an ungracious task, I will proclaim my first law 
<A NAME="35"></A>about the robbing of temples, in case any one should dare to commit such 
<A NAME="36"></A>a crime. I do not expect or imagine that any well-brought-up citizen will 
<A NAME="37"></A>ever take the infection, but their servants, and strangers, and strangers' 
<A NAME="38"></A>servants may be guilty of many impieties. And with a view to them especially, 
<A NAME="39"></A>and yet not without a provident eye to the weakness of human nature generally, 
<A NAME="40"></A>I will proclaim the law about robbers of temples and similar incurable, 
<A NAME="41"></A>or almost incurable, criminals. Having already agreed that such enactments 
<A NAME="42"></A>ought always to have a short prelude, we may speak to the criminal, whom 
<A NAME="43"></A>some tormenting desire by night and by day tempts to go and rob a temple, 
<A NAME="44"></A>the fewest possible words of admonition and exhortation:-O sir, we will 
<A NAME="45"></A>say to him, the impulse which moves you to rob temples is not an ordinary 
<A NAME="46"></A>human malady, nor yet a visitation of heaven, but a madness which is begotten 
<A NAME="47"></A>in a man from ancient and unexpiated crimes of his race, an ever-recurring 
<A NAME="48"></A>curse;-against this you must guard with all your might, and how you are 
<A NAME="49"></A>to guard we will explain to you. When any such thought comes into your 
<A NAME="50"></A>mind, go and perform expiations, go as a suppliant to the temples of the 
<A NAME="51"></A>Gods who avert evils, go to the society of those who are called good men 
<A NAME="52"></A>among you; hear them tell and yourself try to repeat after them, that every 
<A NAME="53"></A>man should honour the noble and the just. Fly from the company of the wicked-fly 
<A NAME="54"></A>and turn not back; and if your disorder is lightened by these remedies, 
<A NAME="55"></A>well and good, but if not, then acknowledge death to be nobler than life, 
<A NAME="56"></A>and depart hence.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>Such are the preludes which we sing to all who have thoughts of 
<A NAME="58"></A>unholy and treasonable actions, and to him who hearkens to them the law 
<A NAME="59"></A>has nothing to say. But to him who is disobedient when the prelude is over, 
<A NAME="60"></A>cry with a loud voice,-He who is taken in the act of robbing temples, if 
<A NAME="61"></A>he be a slave or stranger, shall have his evil deed engraven on his face 
<A NAME="62"></A>and hands, and shall be beaten with as many stripes as may seem good to 
<A NAME="63"></A>the judges, and be cast naked beyond the borders of the land. And if he 
<A NAME="64"></A>suffers this punishment he will probably return to his right mind and be 
<A NAME="65"></A>improved; for no penalty which the law inflicts is designed for evil, but 
<A NAME="66"></A>always makes him who suffers either better or not so much worse as he would 
<A NAME="67"></A>have been. But if any citizen be found guilty of any great or unmentionable 
<A NAME="68"></A>wrong, either in relation to the gods, or his parents, or the state, let 
<A NAME="69"></A>the judge deem him to be incurable, remembering that after receiving such 
<A NAME="70"></A>an excellent education and training from youth upward, he has not abstained 
<A NAME="71"></A>from the greatest of crimes. His punishment shall be death, which to him 
<A NAME="72"></A>will be the least of evils; and his example will benefit others, if he 
<A NAME="73"></A>perish ingloriously, and be cast beyond the borders of the land. But let 
<A NAME="74"></A>his children and family, if they avoid the ways of their father, have glory, 
<A NAME="75"></A>and let honourable mention be made of them, as having nobly and manfully 
<A NAME="76"></A>escaped out of evil into good. None of them should have their goods confiscated 
<A NAME="77"></A>to the state, for the lots of the citizens ought always to continue the 
<A NAME="78"></A>same and equal.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>Touching the exaction of penalties, when a man appears to have 
<A NAME="80"></A>done anything which deserves a fine, he shall pay the fine, if he have 
<A NAME="81"></A>anything in excess of the lot which is assigned to him; but more than that 
<A NAME="82"></A>he shall not pay. And to secure exactness, let the guardians of the law 
<A NAME="83"></A>refer to the registers, and inform the judges of the precise truth, in 
<A NAME="84"></A>order that none of the lots may go uncultivated for want of money. But 
<A NAME="85"></A>if any one seems to deserve a greater penalty, let him undergo a long and 
<A NAME="86"></A>public imprisonment and be dishonoured, unless some of his friends are 
<A NAME="87"></A>willing to be surety for him, and liberate him by assisting him to pay 
<A NAME="88"></A>the fine. No criminal shall go unpunished, not even for a single offence, 
<A NAME="89"></A>nor if he have fled the country; but let the penalty be according to his 
<A NAME="90"></A>deserts-death, or bonds, or blows, or degrading places of sitting or standing, 
<A NAME="91"></A>or removal to some temple on the borders of the land; or let him pay fines, 
<A NAME="92"></A>as we said before. In cases of death, let the judges be the guardians of 
<A NAME="93"></A>the law, and a court selected by merit from the last year's magistrates. 
<A NAME="94"></A>But how the causes are to be brought into to court, how the summonses are 
<A NAME="95"></A>to be served, the like, these things may be left to the younger generation 
<A NAME="96"></A>of legislators to determine; the manner of voting we must determine 
<A NAME="97"></A>ourselves.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>Let the vote be given openly; but before they come to the vote 
<A NAME="99"></A>let the judges sit in order of seniority over against plaintiff and defendant, 
<A NAME="100"></A>and let all the citizens who can spare time hear and take a serious interest 
<A NAME="101"></A>in listening to such causes. First of all the plaintiff shall make one 
<A NAME="102"></A>speech, and then the defendant shall make another; and after the speeches 
<A NAME="103"></A>have been made the eldest judge shall begin to examine the parties, and 
<A NAME="104"></A>proceed to make an adequate enquiry into what has been said; and after 
<A NAME="105"></A>the oldest has spoken, the rest shall proceed in order to examine either 
<A NAME="106"></A>party as to what he finds defective in the evidence, whether of statement 
<A NAME="107"></A>or omission; and he who has nothing to ask shall hand over the examination 
<A NAME="108"></A>to another. And on so much of what has been said as is to the purpose all 
<A NAME="109"></A>the judges shall set their seals, and place the writings on the altar of 
<A NAME="110"></A>Hestia. On the next day they shall meet again, and in like manner put their 
<A NAME="111"></A>questions and go through the cause, and again set their seals upon the 
<A NAME="112"></A>evidence; and when they have three times done this, and have had witnesses 
<A NAME="113"></A>and evidence enough, they shall each of them give a holy vote, after promising 
<A NAME="114"></A>by Hestia that they will decide justly and truly to the utmost of their 
<A NAME="115"></A>power; and so they shall put an end to the suit.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>Next, after what relates to the Gods, follows what relates to the 
<A NAME="117"></A>dissolution of the state:-Whoever by promoting a man to power enslaves 
<A NAME="118"></A>the laws, and subjects the city to factions, using violence and stirring 
<A NAME="119"></A>up sedition contrary to law, him we will deem the greatest enemy of the 
<A NAME="120"></A>whole state. But he who takes no part in such proceedings, and, being one 
<A NAME="121"></A>of the chief magistrates of the state, has no knowledge of the treason, 
<A NAME="122"></A>or, having knowledge of it, by reason of cowardice does not interfere on 
<A NAME="123"></A>behalf of his country, such an one we must consider nearly as bad. Every 
<A NAME="124"></A>man who is worth anything will inform the magistrates, and bring the conspirator 
<A NAME="125"></A>to trial for making a violent and illegal attempt to change the government. 
<A NAME="126"></A>The judges of such cases shall be the same as of the robbers of temples; 
<A NAME="127"></A>and let the whole proceeding be carried on in the same way, and the vote 
<A NAME="128"></A>of the majority condemn to death. But let there be a general rule, that 
<A NAME="129"></A>the disgrace and punishment of the father is not to be visited on the children, 
<A NAME="130"></A>except in the case of some one whose father, grandfather, and great-grandfather 
<A NAME="131"></A>have successively undergone the penalty of death. Such persons the city 
<A NAME="132"></A>shall send away with all their possessions to the city and country of their 
<A NAME="133"></A>ancestors, retaining only and wholly their appointed lot. And out of the 
<A NAME="134"></A>citizens who have more than one son of not less than ten years of age, 
<A NAME="135"></A>they shall select ten whom their father or grandfather by the mother's 
<A NAME="136"></A>or father's side shall appoint, and let them send to Delphi the names of 
<A NAME="137"></A>those who are selected, and him whom the God chooses they shall establish 
<A NAME="138"></A>as heir of the house which has failed; and may he have better fortune than 
<A NAME="139"></A>his predecessors!
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Once more let there be a third general law respecting the 
<A NAME="142"></A>judges who are to give judgment, and the manner of conducting suits against 
<A NAME="143"></A>those who are tried on an accusation of treason; and as concerning the 
<A NAME="144"></A>remaining or departure of their descendants-there shall be one law for 
<A NAME="145"></A>all three, for the traitor, and the robber of temples, and the subverter 
<A NAME="146"></A>by violence of the laws of the state. For a thief, whether he steal much 
<A NAME="147"></A>or little, let there be one law, and one punishment for all alike: in the 
<A NAME="148"></A>first place, let him pay double the amount of the theft if he be convicted, 
<A NAME="149"></A>and if he have so much over and above the allotment;-if he have not, he 
<A NAME="150"></A>shall be bound until he pay the penalty, or persuade him has obtained the 
<A NAME="151"></A>sentence against him to forgive him. But if a person be convicted of a 
<A NAME="152"></A>theft against the state, then if he can persuade the city, or if he will 
<A NAME="153"></A>pay back twice the amount of the theft, he shall be set free from his 
<A NAME="154"></A>bonds.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What makes you say, Stranger, that a theft is all one, 
<A NAME="156"></A>whether the thief may have taken much or little, and either from sacred 
<A NAME="157"></A>or secular places-and these are not the only differences in thefts:-seeing, 
<A NAME="158"></A>then, that they are of many kinds, ought not the legislator to adapt himself 
<A NAME="159"></A>to them, and impose upon them entirely different penalties?
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Excellent. I was running on too fast, Cleinias, and 
<A NAME="161"></A>you impinged upon me, and brought me to my senses, reminding me of what, 
<A NAME="162"></A>indeed, had occurred to mind already, that legislation was never yet rightly 
<A NAME="163"></A>worked out, as I may say in passing.-Do you remember the image in which 
<A NAME="164"></A>I likened the men for whom laws are now made to slaves who are doctored 
<A NAME="165"></A>by slaves? For of this you may be very sure, that if one of those empirical 
<A NAME="166"></A>physicians, who practise medicine without science, were to come upon the 
<A NAME="167"></A>gentleman physician talking to his gentleman patient, and using the language 
<A NAME="168"></A>almost of philosophy, beginning at the beginning of the disease and discoursing 
<A NAME="169"></A>about the whole nature of the body, he would burst into a hearty laugh-he 
<A NAME="170"></A>would say what most of those who are called doctors always have at their 
<A NAME="171"></A>tongue's end:-Foolish fellow, he would say, you are not healing the sick 
<A NAME="172"></A>man, but you are educating him; and he does not want to be made a doctor, 
<A NAME="173"></A>but to get well.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> And would he not be right?
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Perhaps he would; and he might remark upon us that he who 
<A NAME="176"></A>discourses about laws, as we are now doing, is giving the citizens education 
<A NAME="177"></A>and not laws; that would be rather a telling observation.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But we are fortunate.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> In what way?
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Inasmuch as we are not compelled to give laws, but we may 
<A NAME="182"></A>take into consideration every form of government, and ascertain what is 
<A NAME="183"></A>best and what is most needful, and how they may both be carried into execution; 
<A NAME="184"></A>and we may also, if we please, at this very moment choose what is best, 
<A NAME="185"></A>or, if we prefer, what is most necessary-which shall we 
<A NAME="186"></A>do?
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> There is something ridiculous, Stranger, in our proposing 
<A NAME="188"></A>such an alternative as if we were legislators, simply bound under some 
<A NAME="189"></A>great necessity which cannot be deferred to the morrow. But we, as I may 
<A NAME="190"></A>by grace of Heaven affirm, like, gatherers of stones or beginners of some 
<A NAME="191"></A>composite work, may gather a heap of materials, and out of this, at our 
<A NAME="192"></A>leisure, select what is suitable for our projected construction. Let us 
<A NAME="193"></A>then suppose ourselves to be at leisure, not of necessity building, but 
<A NAME="194"></A>rather like men who are partly providing materials, and partly putting 
<A NAME="195"></A>them together. And we may truly say that some of our laws, like stones, 
<A NAME="196"></A>are already fixed in their places, and others lie at 
<A NAME="197"></A>hand.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Certainly, in that case, Cleinias, our view of law 
<A NAME="199"></A>will be more in accordance with nature. For there is another matter affecting 
<A NAME="200"></A>legislators, which I must earnestly entreat you to consider.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> There are many writings to be found in cities, and among 
<A NAME="203"></A>them there, are composed by legislators as well as by other 
<A NAME="204"></A>persons.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Shall we give heed rather to the writings of those others-poets 
<A NAME="207"></A>and the like, who either in metre or out of metre have recorded their advice 
<A NAME="208"></A>about the conduct of life, and not to the writings of legislators? or shall 
<A NAME="209"></A>we give heed to them above all?
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes; to them far above all others.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And ought the legislator alone among writers to withhold 
<A NAME="212"></A>his opinion about the beautiful, the good, and the just, and not to teach 
<A NAME="213"></A>what they are, and how they are to be pursued by those who intend to be 
<A NAME="214"></A>happy?
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And is it disgraceful for Homer and Tyrtaeus and other 
<A NAME="217"></A>poets to lay down evil precepts in their writings respecting life and the 
<A NAME="218"></A>pursuits of men, but not so disgraceful for Lycurgus and Solon and others 
<A NAME="219"></A>who were legislators as well as writers? Is it not true that of all the 
<A NAME="220"></A>writings to be found in cities, those which relate to laws, when you unfold 
<A NAME="221"></A>and read them, ought to be by far the noblest and the best? and should 
<A NAME="222"></A>not other writings either agree with them, or if they disagree, be deemed 
<A NAME="223"></A>ridiculous? We should consider whether the laws of states ought not to 
<A NAME="224"></A>have the character of loving and wise parents, rather than of tyrants and 
<A NAME="225"></A>masters, who command and threaten, and, after writing their decrees on 
<A NAME="226"></A>walls, go their ways; and whether, in discoursing of laws, we should not 
<A NAME="227"></A>take the gentler view of them which may or may not be attainable-at any 
<A NAME="228"></A>rate, we will show our readiness to entertain such a view, and be prepared 
<A NAME="229"></A>to undergo whatever may be the result. And may the result be good, and 
<A NAME="230"></A>if God be gracious, it will be good!
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Excellent; let us do as you say.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then we will now consider accurately, as we proposed, what 
<A NAME="233"></A>relates to robbers of temples, and all kinds of thefts, and offences in 
<A NAME="234"></A>general; and we must not be annoyed if, in the course of legislation, we 
<A NAME="235"></A>have enacted some things, and have not made up our minds about some others; 
<A NAME="236"></A>for as yet we are not legislators, but we may soon be. Let us, if you please, 
<A NAME="237"></A>consider these matters.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Concerning all things honourable and just, let us then 
<A NAME="240"></A>endeavour to ascertain how far we are consistent with ourselves, and how 
<A NAME="241"></A>far we are inconsistent, and how far the many, from whom at any rate we 
<A NAME="242"></A>should profess a desire to differ, agree and disagree among 
<A NAME="243"></A>themselves.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What are the inconsistencies which you observe in 
<A NAME="245"></A>us?
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I will endeavour to explain. If I am not mistaken, we are 
<A NAME="247"></A>all agreed that justice, and just men and things and actions, are all fair, 
<A NAME="248"></A>and, if a person were to maintain that just men, even when they are deformed 
<A NAME="249"></A>in body, are still perfectly beautiful in respect of the excellent justice 
<A NAME="250"></A>of their minds, no one would say that there was any inconsistency in 
<A NAME="251"></A>this.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> They would be quite right.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Perhaps; but let us consider further, that if all things 
<A NAME="254"></A>which are just are fair and honourable, in the term "all" we must include 
<A NAME="255"></A>just sufferings which are the correlatives of just actions.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> And what is the inference?
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The inference is, that a just action in partaking of the 
<A NAME="258"></A>just partakes also in the same degree of the fair and 
<A NAME="259"></A>honourable.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And must not a suffering which partakes of the just principle 
<A NAME="262"></A>be admitted to be in the same degree fair and honourable, if the argument 
<A NAME="263"></A>is consistently carried out?
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But then if we admit suffering to be just and yet dishonourable, 
<A NAME="266"></A>and the term "dishonourable" is applied to justice, will not the just and 
<A NAME="267"></A>the honourable disagree?
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> A thing not difficult to understand; the laws which have 
<A NAME="270"></A>been already enacted would seem to announce principles directly opposed 
<A NAME="271"></A>to what we are saying.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To what?
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> We had enacted, if I am not mistaken, that the robber of 
<A NAME="274"></A>temples, and he who was the enemy of law and order, might justly be put 
<A NAME="275"></A>to death, and we were proceeding to make divers other enactments of a similar 
<A NAME="276"></A>nature. But we stopped short, because we saw that these sufferings are 
<A NAME="277"></A>infinite in number and degree, and that they are, at once, the most just 
<A NAME="278"></A>and also the most dishonourable of all sufferings. And if this be true, 
<A NAME="279"></A>are not the just and the honourable at one time all the same, and at another 
<A NAME="280"></A>time in the most diametrical opposition?
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Such appears to be the case.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In this discordant and inconsistent fashion does the language 
<A NAME="283"></A>of the many rend asunder the honourable and just.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true, Stranger.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then now, Cleinias, let us see how far we ourselves are 
<A NAME="286"></A>consistent about these matters.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Consistent in what?
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I think that I have clearly stated in the former part of 
<A NAME="289"></A>the discussion, but if I did not, let me now state-
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What?
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> That all bad men are always involuntarily bad; and from 
<A NAME="292"></A>this must proceed to draw a further inference.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> That the unjust man may be bad, but that he is bad against 
<A NAME="295"></A>his will. Now that an action which is voluntary should be done involuntarily 
<A NAME="296"></A>is a contradiction; wherefore he who maintains that injustice is involuntary 
<A NAME="297"></A>will deem that the unjust does injustice involuntarily. I too admit that 
<A NAME="298"></A>all men do injustice involuntarily, and if any contentious or disputatious 
<A NAME="299"></A>person says that men are unjust against their will, and yet that many do 
<A NAME="300"></A>injustice willingly, I do not agree with him. But, then, how can I avoid 
<A NAME="301"></A>being inconsistent with myself, if you, Cleinias, and you, Megillus, say 
<A NAME="302"></A>to me-Well, Stranger, if all this be as you say, how about legislating 
<A NAME="303"></A>for the city of the Magnetes-shall we legislate or not-what do you advise? 
<A NAME="304"></A>Certainly we will, I should reply. Then will you determine for them what 
<A NAME="305"></A>are voluntary and what are involuntary crimes, and shall we make the punishments 
<A NAME="306"></A>greater of voluntary errors and crimes and less for the involuntary? or 
<A NAME="307"></A>shall we make the punishment of all to be alike, under the idea that there 
<A NAME="308"></A>is no such thing as voluntary crime?
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very good, Stranger; and what shall we say in answer 
<A NAME="310"></A>to these objections?
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> That is a very fair question. In the first place, let 
<A NAME="312"></A>us-
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Do what?
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us remember what has been well said by us already, 
<A NAME="315"></A>that our ideas of justice are in the highest degree confused and contradictory. 
<A NAME="316"></A>Bearing this in mind, let us proceed to ask ourselves once more whether 
<A NAME="317"></A>we have discovered a way out of the difficulty. Have we ever determined 
<A NAME="318"></A>in what respect these two classes of actions differ from one another? For 
<A NAME="319"></A>in all states and by all legislators whatsoever, two kinds of actions have 
<A NAME="320"></A>been distinguished-the one, voluntary, the other, involuntary; and they 
<A NAME="321"></A>have legislated about them accordingly. But shall this new word of ours, 
<A NAME="322"></A>like an oracle of God, be only spoken, and get away without giving any 
<A NAME="323"></A>explanation or verification of itself? How can a word not understood be 
<A NAME="324"></A>the basis of legislation? Impossible. Before proceeding to legislate, then, 
<A NAME="325"></A>we must prove that they are two, and what is the difference between them, 
<A NAME="326"></A>that when we impose the penalty upon either, every one may understand our 
<A NAME="327"></A>proposal, and be able in some way to judge whether the penalty is fitly 
<A NAME="328"></A>or unfitly inflicted.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I agree with you, Stranger; for one of two things is 
<A NAME="330"></A>certain: either we must not say that all unjust acts are involuntary, or 
<A NAME="331"></A>we must show the meaning and truth of this statement.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Of these two alternatives, the one is quite intolerable-not 
<A NAME="333"></A>to speak what I believe to be the truth would be to me unlawful and unholy. 
<A NAME="334"></A>But if acts of injustice cannot be divided into voluntary and involuntary, 
<A NAME="335"></A>I must endeavour to find some other distinction between 
<A NAME="336"></A>them.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true, Stranger; there cannot be two opinions among 
<A NAME="338"></A>us upon that point.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Reflect, then; there are hurts of various kinds done 
<A NAME="340"></A>by the citizens to one another in the intercourse of life, affording plentiful 
<A NAME="341"></A>examples both of the voluntary and involuntary.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I would not have any one suppose that all these hurts are 
<A NAME="344"></A>injuries, and that these injuries are of two kinds-one, voluntary, and 
<A NAME="345"></A>the other, involuntary; for the involuntary hurts of all men are quite 
<A NAME="346"></A>as many and as great as the voluntary? And please to consider whether I 
<A NAME="347"></A>am right or quite wrong in what I am going to say; for I deny, Cleinias 
<A NAME="348"></A>and Megillus, that he who harms another involuntarily does him an injury 
<A NAME="349"></A>involuntarily, nor should I legislate about such an act under the idea 
<A NAME="350"></A>that I am legislating for an involuntary injury. But I should rather say 
<A NAME="351"></A>that such a hurt, whether great or small, is not an injury at all; and, 
<A NAME="352"></A>on the other hand, if I am right, when a benefit is wrongly conferred, 
<A NAME="353"></A>the author of the benefit may often be said to injure. For I maintain, 
<A NAME="354"></A>O my friends, that the mere giving or taking away of anything is not to 
<A NAME="355"></A>be described either as just or unjust; but the legislator has to consider 
<A NAME="356"></A>whether mankind do good or harm to one another out of a just principle 
<A NAME="357"></A>and intention. On the distinction between injustice and hurt he must fix 
<A NAME="358"></A>his eye; and when there is hurt, he must, as far as he can, make the hurt 
<A NAME="359"></A>good by law, and save that which is ruined, and raise up that which is 
<A NAME="360"></A>fallen, and make that which is dead or wounded whole. And when compensation 
<A NAME="361"></A>has been given for injustice, the law must always seek to win over the 
<A NAME="362"></A>doers and sufferers of the several hurts from feelings of enmity to those 
<A NAME="363"></A>of friendship.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then as to unjust hurts (and gains also, supposing the 
<A NAME="366"></A>injustice to bring gain), of these we may heal as many as are capable of 
<A NAME="367"></A>being healed, regarding them as diseases of the soul; and the cure of injustice 
<A NAME="368"></A>will take the following direction.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What direction?
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> When any one commits any injustice, small or great, the 
<A NAME="371"></A>law will admonish and compel him either never at all to do the like again, 
<A NAME="372"></A>or never voluntarily, or at any rate in a far less degree; and he must 
<A NAME="373"></A>in addition pay for the hurt. Whether the end is to be attained by word 
<A NAME="374"></A>or action, with pleasure or pain, by giving or taking away privileges, 
<A NAME="375"></A>by means of fines or gifts, or in whatsoever way the law shall proceed 
<A NAME="376"></A>to make a man hate injustice, and love or not hate the nature of the just-this 
<A NAME="377"></A>is quite the noblest work of law. But if the legislator sees any one who 
<A NAME="378"></A>is incurable, for him he will appoint a law and a penalty. He knows quite 
<A NAME="379"></A>well that to such men themselves there is no profit in the continuance 
<A NAME="380"></A>of their lives, and that they would do a double good to the rest of mankind 
<A NAME="381"></A>if they would take their departure, inasmuch as they would be an example 
<A NAME="382"></A>to other men not to offend, and they would relieve the city of bad citizens. 
<A NAME="383"></A>In such cases, and in such cases only, the legislator ought to inflict 
<A NAME="384"></A>death as the punishment of offences.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What you have said appears to me to be very reasonable, 
<A NAME="386"></A>but will you favour me by stating a little more clearly the difference 
<A NAME="387"></A>between hurt and injustice, and the various complications of the voluntary 
<A NAME="388"></A>and involuntary which enter into them?
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> I will endeavour to do as you wish:-Concerning the 
<A NAME="390"></A>soul, thus much would be generally said and allowed, that one element in 
<A NAME="391"></A>her nature is passion, which may be described either as a state or a part 
<A NAME="392"></A>of her, and is hard to be striven against and contended with, and by irrational 
<A NAME="393"></A>force overturns many things.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And pleasure is not the same with passion, but has an opposite 
<A NAME="396"></A>power, working her will by persuasion and by the force of deceit in all 
<A NAME="397"></A>things.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> A man may truly say that ignorance is a third cause of 
<A NAME="400"></A>crimes. Ignorance, however, may be conveniently divided by the legislator 
<A NAME="401"></A>into two sorts: there is simple ignorance, which is the source of lighter 
<A NAME="402"></A>offences, and double ignorance, which is accompanied by a conceit of wisdom; 
<A NAME="403"></A>and he who is under the influence of the latter fancies that he knows all 
<A NAME="404"></A>about matters of which he knows nothing. This second kind of ignorance, 
<A NAME="405"></A>when possessed of power and strength, will be held by the legislator to 
<A NAME="406"></A>be the source of great and monstrous times, but when attended with weakness, 
<A NAME="407"></A>will only result in the errors of children and old men; and these he will 
<A NAME="408"></A>treat as errors, and will make laws accordingly for those who commit them, 
<A NAME="409"></A>which will be the mildest and most merciful of all laws.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> You are perfectly right.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> We all of us remark of one man that he is superior to pleasure 
<A NAME="412"></A>and passion, and of another that he is inferior to them; and this is 
<A NAME="413"></A>true.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But no one was ever yet heard to say that one of us is 
<A NAME="416"></A>superior and another inferior to ignorance.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> We are speaking of motives which incite men to the fulfilment 
<A NAME="419"></A>of their will; although an individual may be often drawn by them in opposite 
<A NAME="420"></A>directions at the same time.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes, often.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And now I can define to you clearly, and without ambiguity, 
<A NAME="423"></A>what I mean by the just and unjust, according to my notion of them:-When 
<A NAME="424"></A>anger and fear, and pleasure and pain, and jealousies and desires, tyrannize 
<A NAME="425"></A>over the soul, whether they do any harm or not-I call all this injustice. 
<A NAME="426"></A>But when the opinion of the best, in whatever part of human nature states 
<A NAME="427"></A>or individuals may suppose that to dwell, has dominion in the soul and 
<A NAME="428"></A>orders the life of every man, even if it be sometimes mistaken, yet what 
<A NAME="429"></A>is done in accordance therewith, the principle in individuals which obeys 
<A NAME="430"></A>this rule, and is best for the whole life of man, is to be called just; 
<A NAME="431"></A>although the hurt done by mistake is thought by many to be involuntary 
<A NAME="432"></A>injustice. Leaving the question of names, about which we are not going 
<A NAME="433"></A>to quarrel, and having already delineated three sources of error, we may 
<A NAME="434"></A>begin by recalling them somewhat more vividly to our memory:-One of them 
<A NAME="435"></A>was of the painful sort, which we denominate anger and 
<A NAME="436"></A>fear.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Quite right.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> There was a second consisting of pleasures and desires, 
<A NAME="439"></A>and a third of hopes, which aimed at true opinion about the best. The latter 
<A NAME="440"></A>being subdivided into three, we now get five sources of actions; and for 
<A NAME="441"></A>these five we will make laws of two kinds.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What are the two kinds?
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> There is one kind of actions done by violence and in the 
<A NAME="444"></A>light of day, and another kind of actions which are done in darkness and 
<A NAME="445"></A>with secret deceit, or sometimes both with violence and deceit; the laws 
<A NAME="446"></A>concerning these last ought to have a character of severity.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Naturally.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And now let us return from this digression and complete 
<A NAME="449"></A>the work of legislation. Laws have been already enacted by us concerning 
<A NAME="450"></A>the robbers of the Gods, and concerning traitors, and also concerning those 
<A NAME="451"></A>who corrupt the laws for the purpose of subverting the government. A man 
<A NAME="452"></A>may very likely commit some of these crimes, either in a state of madness 
<A NAME="453"></A>or when affected by disease, or under the influence of extreme old age, 
<A NAME="454"></A>or in a fit of childish wantonness, himself no better than a child. And 
<A NAME="455"></A>if this be made evident to the judges elected to try the cause, on the 
<A NAME="456"></A>appeal of the criminal or his advocate, and he be judged to have been in 
<A NAME="457"></A>this state when he committed the offence, he shall simply pay for the hurt 
<A NAME="458"></A>which he may have done to another; but he shall be exempt from other penalties, 
<A NAME="459"></A>unless he have slain some one, and have on his hands the stain of blood. 
<A NAME="460"></A>And in that case he shall go to another land and country, and there dwell 
<A NAME="461"></A>for a year; and if he return before the expiration of the time which the 
<A NAME="462"></A>law appoints, or even set his foot at all on his native land, he shall 
<A NAME="463"></A>be bound by the guardians of the law in the public prison for two years, 
<A NAME="464"></A>and then go free.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>Having begun to speak of homicide, let us endeavour to lay down 
<A NAME="466"></A>laws concerning every different kind of homicides, and, first of all, concerning 
<A NAME="467"></A>violent and involuntary homicides. If any one in an athletic contest, and 
<A NAME="468"></A>at the public games, involuntarily kills a friend, and he dies either at 
<A NAME="469"></A>the time or afterwards of the blows which he has received; or if the like 
<A NAME="470"></A>misfortune happens to any one in war, or military exercises, or mimic contests. 
<A NAME="471"></A>of which the magistrates enjoin the practice, whether with or without arms, 
<A NAME="472"></A>when he has been purified according to the law brought from Delphi relating 
<A NAME="473"></A>to these matters, he shall be innocent. And so in the case of physicians: 
<A NAME="474"></A>if their patient dies against their will, they shall be held guiltless 
<A NAME="475"></A>by the law. And if one slay another with his own hand, but unintentionally, 
<A NAME="476"></A>whether he be unarmed or have some instrument or dart in his hand; or if 
<A NAME="477"></A>he kill him by administering food or drink or by the application of fire 
<A NAME="478"></A>or cold, or by suffocating him, whether he do the deed by his own hand, 
<A NAME="479"></A>or by the agency of others, he shall be deemed the agent, and shall suffer 
<A NAME="480"></A>one of the following penalties:-If he kill the slave of another in the 
<A NAME="481"></A>belief that he is his own, he shall bear the master of the dead man harmless 
<A NAME="482"></A>from loss, or shall pay a penalty of twice the value of the dead man, which 
<A NAME="483"></A>the judges shall assess; but purifications must be used greater and more 
<A NAME="484"></A>numerous than for those who committed homicide at the games;-what they 
<A NAME="485"></A>are to be, the interpreters whom the God appoints shall be authorized to 
<A NAME="486"></A>declare. And if a man kills his own slave, when he has been purified according 
<A NAME="487"></A>to laws he shall be quit of the homicide. And if a man kills a freeman 
<A NAME="488"></A>unintentionally, he shall undergo the same purification as he did who killed 
<A NAME="489"></A>the slave. But let him not forget also a tale of olden time, which is to 
<A NAME="490"></A>this effect:-He who has suffered a violent end, when newly dead, if he 
<A NAME="491"></A>has had the soul of a freeman in life, is angry with the author of his 
<A NAME="492"></A>death; and being himself full of fear and panic by reason of his violent 
<A NAME="493"></A>end, when he sees his murderer walking about in his own accustomed haunts, 
<A NAME="494"></A>he is stricken with terror and becomes disordered, and this disorder of 
<A NAME="495"></A>his, aided by the guilty recollection of is communicated by him with overwhelming 
<A NAME="496"></A>force to the murderer and his deeds. Wherefore also the murderer must go 
<A NAME="497"></A>out of the way of his victim for the entire period of a year, and not himself 
<A NAME="498"></A>be found in any spot which was familiar to him throughout the country. 
<A NAME="499"></A>And if the dead man be a stranger, the homicide shall be kept from the 
<A NAME="500"></A>country of the stranger during a like period. If any one voluntarily obeys 
<A NAME="501"></A>this law, the next of kin to the deceased, seeing all that has happened, 
<A NAME="502"></A>shall take pity on him, and make peace with him, and show him all gentleness. 
<A NAME="503"></A>But if any one is disobedient, either ventures to go to any of the temples 
<A NAME="504"></A>and sacrifice unpurified, or will not continue in exile during the appointed 
<A NAME="505"></A>time, the next of kin to the deceased shall proceed against him for murder; 
<A NAME="506"></A>and if he be convicted, every part of his punishment shall be 
<A NAME="507"></A>doubled.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>And if the next of kin do not proceed against the perpetrator of 
<A NAME="509"></A>the crime, then the pollution shall be deemed to fall upon his own head;-the 
<A NAME="510"></A>murdered man will fix the guilt upon his kinsman, and he who has a mind 
<A NAME="511"></A>to proceed against him may compel him to be absent from his country during 
<A NAME="512"></A>five years, according to law. If a stranger unintentionally kill a stranger 
<A NAME="513"></A>who is dwelling in the city, he who likes shall prosecute the cause according 
<A NAME="514"></A>to the same rules. If he be a metic, let him be absent for a year, or if 
<A NAME="515"></A>he be an entire stranger, in addition to the purification, whether he have 
<A NAME="516"></A>slain a stranger, or a metic, or a citizen, he shall be banished for life 
<A NAME="517"></A>from the country which is in possession of our laws. And if he return contrary 
<A NAME="518"></A>to law, let the guardians of the law punish him with death; and let them 
<A NAME="519"></A>hand over his property, if he have any, to him who is next of kin to the 
<A NAME="520"></A>sufferer. And if he be wrecked, and driven on the coast against his will, 
<A NAME="521"></A>he shall take up his abode on the seashore, wetting his feet in the sea, 
<A NAME="522"></A>and watching for an opportunity of sailing; but if he be brought by land, 
<A NAME="523"></A>and is not his own master, let the magistrate whom he first comes across 
<A NAME="524"></A>in the city, release him and send him unharmed over the 
<A NAME="525"></A>border.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>If any one slays a freeman with his own hand and the deed be done 
<A NAME="527"></A>in passion, in the case of such actions we must begin by making a distinction. 
<A NAME="528"></A>For a deed is done from passion either when men suddenly, and without intention 
<A NAME="529"></A>to kill, cause the death of another by blows and the like on a momentary 
<A NAME="530"></A>impulse, and are sorry for the deed immediately afterwards; or again, when 
<A NAME="531"></A>after having been insulted in deed or word, men pursue revenge, and kill 
<A NAME="532"></A>a person intentionally, and are not sorry for the act. And, therefore, 
<A NAME="533"></A>we must assume that these homicides are of two kinds, both of them arising 
<A NAME="534"></A>from passion, which may be justly said to be in a mean between the voluntary 
<A NAME="535"></A>and involuntary; at the same time, they are neither of them anything more 
<A NAME="536"></A>than a likeness or shadow of either. He who treasures up his anger, and 
<A NAME="537"></A>avenges himself, not immediately and at the moment, but with insidious 
<A NAME="538"></A>design, and after an interval, is like the voluntary; but he who does not 
<A NAME="539"></A>treasure up his anger, and takes vengeance on the instant, and without 
<A NAME="540"></A>malice prepense, approaches to the involuntary; and yet even he is not 
<A NAME="541"></A>altogether involuntary, but only the image or shadow of the involuntary; 
<A NAME="542"></A>wherefore about homicides committed in hot blood, there is a difficulty 
<A NAME="543"></A>in determining whether in legislating we shall reckon them as voluntary 
<A NAME="544"></A>or as partly involuntary. The best and truest view is to regard them respectively 
<A NAME="545"></A>as likenesses only of the voluntary and involuntary, and to distinguish 
<A NAME="546"></A>them accordingly as they are done with or without premeditation. And we 
<A NAME="547"></A>should make the penalties heavier for those who commit homicide with angry 
<A NAME="548"></A>premeditation, and lighter for those who do not premeditate, but smite 
<A NAME="549"></A>upon the instant; for that which is like a greater evil should be punished 
<A NAME="550"></A>more severely, and that which is like a less evil should be punished less 
<A NAME="551"></A>severely: this shall be the rule of our laws.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us proceed:-If any one slays a free man with his own 
<A NAME="554"></A>hand, and the deed be done in a moment of anger, and without premeditation, 
<A NAME="555"></A>let the offender suffer in other respects as the involuntary homicide would 
<A NAME="556"></A>have suffered, and also undergo an exile of two years, that he may learn 
<A NAME="557"></A>to school his passions. But he who slays another from passion, yet with 
<A NAME="558"></A>premeditation, shall in other respects suffer as the former; and to this 
<A NAME="559"></A>shall be added an exile of three instead of two years-his punishment is 
<A NAME="560"></A>to be longer because his passion is greater. The manner of their return 
<A NAME="561"></A>shall be on this wise: (and here the law has difficulty in determining 
<A NAME="562"></A>exactly; for in some cases the murderer who is judged by the law to be 
<A NAME="563"></A>the worse may really be the less cruel, and he who is judged the less cruel 
<A NAME="564"></A>may be really the worse, and may have executed the murder in a more savage 
<A NAME="565"></A>manner, whereas the other may have been gentler. But in general the degrees 
<A NAME="566"></A>of guilt will be such as we have described them. Of all these things the 
<A NAME="567"></A>guardians of the law must take cognisance):-When a homicide of either kind 
<A NAME="568"></A>has completed his term of exile, the guardians shall send twelve judges 
<A NAME="569"></A>to the borders of the land; these during the interval shall have informed 
<A NAME="570"></A>themselves of the actions of the criminals, and they shall judge respecting 
<A NAME="571"></A>their pardon and reception; and the homicides shall abide by their judgment. 
<A NAME="572"></A>But if after they have returned home, any one of them in a moment of anger 
<A NAME="573"></A>repeats the deed, let him be an exile, and return no more; or if he returns, 
<A NAME="574"></A>let him suffer as the stranger was to suffer in a similar case. He who 
<A NAME="575"></A>kills his own slave shall undergo a purification, but if he kills the slave 
<A NAME="576"></A>of another in anger, he shall pay twice the amount of the loss to his owner. 
<A NAME="577"></A>And if any homicide is disobedient to the law, and without purification 
<A NAME="578"></A>pollutes the agora, or the games, or the temples, he who pleases may bring 
<A NAME="579"></A>to trial the next of kin to the dead man for permitting him, and the murderer 
<A NAME="580"></A>with him, and may compel the one to exact and the other to suffer a double 
<A NAME="581"></A>amount of fines and purifications; and the accuser shall himself receive 
<A NAME="582"></A>the fine in accordance with the law. If a slave in a fit of passion kills 
<A NAME="583"></A>his master, the kindred of the deceased man may do with the murderer (provided 
<A NAME="584"></A>only they do not spare his life) whatever they please, and they will be 
<A NAME="585"></A>pure; or if he kills a freeman, who is not his master, the owner shall 
<A NAME="586"></A>give up the slave to the relatives of the deceased, and they shall be under 
<A NAME="587"></A>an obligation to put him to death, but this may be done in any manner which 
<A NAME="588"></A>they please.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>And if (which is a rare occurrence, but does sometimes happen) 
<A NAME="590"></A>a father or a mother in a moment of passion slays a son or daughter by 
<A NAME="591"></A>blows, or some other violence, the slayer shall undergo the same purification 
<A NAME="592"></A>as in other cases, and be exiled during three years; but when the exile 
<A NAME="593"></A>returns the wife shall separate from the husband, and the husband from 
<A NAME="594"></A>the wife, and they shall never afterwards beget children together, or live 
<A NAME="595"></A>under the same roof, or partake of the same sacred rites with those whom 
<A NAME="596"></A>they have deprived of a child or of a brother. And he who is impious and 
<A NAME="597"></A>disobedient in such a case shall be brought to trial for impiety by any 
<A NAME="598"></A>one who pleases. If in a fit of anger a husband kills his wedded wife, 
<A NAME="599"></A>or the wife her husband, the slayer shall undergo the same purification, 
<A NAME="600"></A>and the term of exile shall be three years. And when he who has committed 
<A NAME="601"></A>any such crime returns, let him have no communication in sacred rites with 
<A NAME="602"></A>his children, neither let him sit at the same table with them, and the 
<A NAME="603"></A>father or son who disobeys shall be liable to be brought to trial for impiety 
<A NAME="604"></A>by any one who pleases. If a brother or a sister in a fit of passion kills 
<A NAME="605"></A>a brother or a sister, they shall undergo purification and exile, as was 
<A NAME="606"></A>the case with parents who killed their offspring: they shall not come under 
<A NAME="607"></A>the same roof, or share in the sacred rites of those whom they have deprived 
<A NAME="608"></A>of their brethren, or of their children.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR>And he who is disobedient shall be justly liable to the law concerning 
<A NAME="610"></A>impiety, which relates to these matters. If any one is so violent in his 
<A NAME="611"></A>passion against his parents, that in the madness of his anger he dares 
<A NAME="612"></A>to kill one of them, if the murdered person before dying freely forgives 
<A NAME="613"></A>the murderer, let him undergo the purification which is assigned to those 
<A NAME="614"></A>who have been guilty of involuntary homicide, and do as they do, and he 
<A NAME="615"></A>shall be pure. But if he be not acquitted, the perpetrator of such a deed 
<A NAME="616"></A>shall be amenable to many laws;-he shall be amenable to the extreme punishments 
<A NAME="617"></A>for assault, and impiety, and robbing of temples, for he has robbed his 
<A NAME="618"></A>parent of life; and if a man could be slain more than once, most justly 
<A NAME="619"></A>would he who in a fit of passion has slain father or mother, undergo many 
<A NAME="620"></A>deaths. How can he, whom, alone of all men, even in defence of his life, 
<A NAME="621"></A>and when about to suffer death at the hands of his parents, no law will 
<A NAME="622"></A>allow to kill his father or his mother who are the authors of his being, 
<A NAME="623"></A>and whom the legislator will command to endure any extremity rather than 
<A NAME="624"></A>do this-how can he, I say, lawfully receive any other punishment? Let death 
<A NAME="625"></A>then be the appointed punishment of him who in a fit of passion slays his 
<A NAME="626"></A>father or his mother. But if brother kills brother in a civil broil, or 
<A NAME="627"></A>under other like circumstances, if the other has begun, and he only defends 
<A NAME="628"></A>himself, let him be free from guilt, as he would be if he had slain an 
<A NAME="629"></A>enemy; and the same rule will apply if a citizen kill a citizen, or a stranger 
<A NAME="630"></A>a stranger. Or if a stranger kill a citizen or a citizen a stranger in 
<A NAME="631"></A>self-defence, let him be free from guilt in like manner; and so in the 
<A NAME="632"></A>case of a slave who has killed a slave; but if a slave have killed a freeman 
<A NAME="633"></A>in self-defence, let him be subject to the same law as he who has killed 
<A NAME="634"></A>a father; and let the law about the remission of penalties in the case 
<A NAME="635"></A>of parricide apply equally to every other remission. Whenever any sufferer 
<A NAME="636"></A>of his own accord remits the guilt of homicide to another, under the idea 
<A NAME="637"></A>that his act was involuntary, let the perpetrator of the deed undergo a 
<A NAME="638"></A>purification and remain in exile for a year, according to 
<A NAME="639"></A>law.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>Enough has been said of murders violent and involuntary and committed 
<A NAME="641"></A>in passion: we have now to speak of voluntary crimes done with injustice 
<A NAME="642"></A>of every kind and with premeditation, through the influence of pleasures, 
<A NAME="643"></A>and desires, and jealousies.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us first speak, as far as we are able, of their various 
<A NAME="646"></A>kinds. The greatest cause of them is lust, which gets the mastery of the 
<A NAME="647"></A>soul maddened by desire; and this is most commonly found to exist where 
<A NAME="648"></A>the passion reigns which is strongest and most prevalent among mass of 
<A NAME="649"></A>mankind: I mean where the power of wealth breeds endless desires of never-to-be-satisfied 
<A NAME="650"></A>acquisition, originating in natural disposition, and a miserable want of 
<A NAME="651"></A>education. Of this want of education, the false praise of wealth which 
<A NAME="652"></A>is bruited about both among Hellenes and barbarians is the cause; they 
<A NAME="653"></A>deem that to be the first of goods which in reality is only the third. 
<A NAME="654"></A>And in this way they wrong both posterity and themselves, for nothing can 
<A NAME="655"></A>be nobler and better than that the truth about wealth should be spoken 
<A NAME="656"></A>in all states-namely, that riches are for the sake of the body, as the 
<A NAME="657"></A>body is for the sake of the soul. They are good, and wealth is intended 
<A NAME="658"></A>by nature to be for the sake of them, and is therefore inferior to them 
<A NAME="659"></A>both, and third in order of excellence. This argument teaches us that he 
<A NAME="660"></A>who would be happy ought not to seek to be rich, or rather he should seek 
<A NAME="661"></A>to be rich justly and temperately, and then there would be no murders in 
<A NAME="662"></A>states requiring to be purged away by other murders. But now, as I said 
<A NAME="663"></A>at first, avarice is the chiefest cause and source of the worst trials 
<A NAME="664"></A>for voluntary homicide. A second cause is ambition: this creates jealousies, 
<A NAME="665"></A>which are troublesome companions, above all to the jealous man himself, 
<A NAME="666"></A>and in a less degree to the chiefs of the state. And a third cause is cowardly 
<A NAME="667"></A>and unjust fear, which has been the occasion of many murders. When a man 
<A NAME="668"></A>is doing or has done something which he desires that no one should know 
<A NAME="669"></A>him to be doing or to have done, he will take the life of those who are 
<A NAME="670"></A>likely to inform of such things, if he have no other means of getting rid 
<A NAME="671"></A>of them. Let this be said as a prelude concerning crimes of violence in 
<A NAME="672"></A>general; and I must not omit to mention a tradition which is firmly believed 
<A NAME="673"></A>by many, and has been received by them from those who are learned in the 
<A NAME="674"></A>mysteries: they say that such deeds will be punished in the world below, 
<A NAME="675"></A>and also that when the perpetrators return to this world they will pay 
<A NAME="676"></A>the natural penalty which is due to the sufferer, and end their lives in 
<A NAME="677"></A>like manner by the hand of another. If he who is about to commit murder 
<A NAME="678"></A>believes this, and is made by the mere prelude to dread such a penalty, 
<A NAME="679"></A>there is no need to proceed with the proclamation of the law. But if he 
<A NAME="680"></A>will not listen, let the following law be declared and registered against 
<A NAME="681"></A>him:
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><BR>Whoever shall wrongfully and of design slay with his own hand any 
<A NAME="683"></A>of his kinsmen, shall in the first place be deprived of legal privileges; 
<A NAME="684"></A>and he shall not pollute the temples, or the agora, or the harbours, or 
<A NAME="685"></A>any other place of meeting, whether he is forbidden of men or not; for 
<A NAME="686"></A>the law, which represents the whole state, forbids him, and always is and 
<A NAME="687"></A>will be in the attitude of forbidding him. And if a cousin or nearer relative 
<A NAME="688"></A>of the deceased, whether on the male or female side, does not prosecute 
<A NAME="689"></A>the homicide when he ought, and have him proclaimed an outlaw, he shall 
<A NAME="690"></A>in the first place be involved in the pollution, and incur the hatred of 
<A NAME="691"></A>the Gods, even as the curse of the law stirs up the voices of men against 
<A NAME="692"></A>him; and in the second place he shall be liable to be prosecuted by any 
<A NAME="693"></A>one who is willing to inflict retribution on behalf of the dead. And he 
<A NAME="694"></A>who would avenge a murder shall observe all the precautionary ceremonies 
<A NAME="695"></A>of lavation, and any others which the God commands in cases of this kind. 
<A NAME="696"></A>Let him have proclamation made, and then go forth and compel the perpetrator 
<A NAME="697"></A>to suffer the execution of justice according to the law. Now the legislator 
<A NAME="698"></A>may easily show that these things must be accomplished by prayers and sacrifices 
<A NAME="699"></A>to certain Gods, who are concerned with the prevention of murders in states. 
<A NAME="700"></A>But who these Gods are, and what should be the true manner of instituting 
<A NAME="701"></A>such trials with due regard to religion, the guardians of the law, aided 
<A NAME="702"></A>by the interpreters, and the prophets, and the God, shall determine, and 
<A NAME="703"></A>when they have determined let them carry on the prosecution at law. The 
<A NAME="704"></A>cause shall have the same judges who are appointed to decide in the case 
<A NAME="705"></A>of those who plunder temples. Let him who is convicted be punished with 
<A NAME="706"></A>death, and let him not be buried in the country of the murdered man, for 
<A NAME="707"></A>this would be shameless as well as impious. But if he fly and will not 
<A NAME="708"></A>stand his trial, let him fly for ever; or, if he set foot anywhere on any 
<A NAME="709"></A>part of the murdered man's country, let any relation of the deceased, or 
<A NAME="710"></A>any other citizen who may first happen to meet with him, kill him with 
<A NAME="711"></A>impunity, or bind and deliver him to those among the judges of the case 
<A NAME="712"></A>who are magistrates, that they may put him to death. And let the prosecutor 
<A NAME="713"></A>demand surety of him whom he prosecutes; three sureties sufficient in the 
<A NAME="714"></A>opinion of the magistrates who try the cause shall be provided by him, 
<A NAME="715"></A>and they shall undertake to produce him at the trial. But if he be unwilling 
<A NAME="716"></A>or unable to provide sureties, then the magistrates shall take him and 
<A NAME="717"></A>keep him in bonds, and produce him at the day of trial.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR><BR>If a man do not commit a murder with his own hand, but contrives 
<A NAME="719"></A>the death of another, and is the author of the deed in intention and design, 
<A NAME="720"></A>and he continues to dwell in the city, having his soul not pure of the 
<A NAME="721"></A>guilt of murder, let him be tried in the same way, except in what relates 
<A NAME="722"></A>to the sureties; and also, if he be found guilty, his body after execution 
<A NAME="723"></A>may have burial in his native land, but in all other respects his case 
<A NAME="724"></A>shall be as the former; and whether a stranger shall kill a citizen, or 
<A NAME="725"></A>a citizen a stranger, or a slave a slave, there shall be no difference 
<A NAME="726"></A>as touching murder by one's own hand or by contrivance, except in the matter 
<A NAME="727"></A>of sureties; and these, as has been said, shall be required of the actual 
<A NAME="728"></A>murderer only, and he who brings the accusation shall bind them over at 
<A NAME="729"></A>the time. If a slave be convicted of slaying a freeman voluntarily, either 
<A NAME="730"></A>by his own hand or by contrivance, let the public executioner take him 
<A NAME="731"></A>in the direction of the sepulchre, to a place whence he can see the tomb 
<A NAME="732"></A>of the dead man, and inflict upon him as many stripes as the person who 
<A NAME="733"></A>caught him orders, and if he survive, let him put him to death. And if 
<A NAME="734"></A>any one kills a slave who has done no wrong, because he is afraid that 
<A NAME="735"></A>he may inform of some base and evil deeds of his own, or for any similar 
<A NAME="736"></A>reason, in such a case let him pay the penalty of murder, as he would have 
<A NAME="737"></A>done if he had slain a citizen. There are things about which it is terrible 
<A NAME="738"></A>and unpleasant to legislate, but impossible not to legislate. If, for example, 
<A NAME="739"></A>there should be murders of kinsmen, either perpetrated by the hands of 
<A NAME="740"></A>kinsmen, or by their contrivance, voluntary and purely malicious, which 
<A NAME="741"></A>most often happen in ill-regulated and ill-educated states, and may perhaps 
<A NAME="742"></A>occur even in a country where a man would not expect to find them, we must 
<A NAME="743"></A>repeat once more the tale which we narrated a little while ago, in the 
<A NAME="744"></A>hope that he who hears us will be the more disposed to abstain voluntarily 
<A NAME="745"></A>on these grounds from murders which are utterly abominable. For the myth, 
<A NAME="746"></A>or saying, or whatever we ought to call it, has been plainly set forth 
<A NAME="747"></A>by priests of old; they have pronounced that the justice which guards and 
<A NAME="748"></A>avenges the blood of kindred, follows the law of retaliation, and ordains 
<A NAME="749"></A>that he who has done any murderous act should of necessity suffer that 
<A NAME="750"></A>which he has done. He who has slain a father shall himself be slain at 
<A NAME="751"></A>some time or other by his children-if a mother, he shall of necessity take 
<A NAME="752"></A>a woman's nature, and lose his life at the hands of his offspring in after 
<A NAME="753"></A>ages; for where the blood of a family has been polluted there is no other 
<A NAME="754"></A>purification, nor can the pollution be washed out until the homicidal soul 
<A NAME="755"></A>which the deed has given life for life, and has propitiated and laid to 
<A NAME="756"></A>sleep the wrath of the whole family. These are the retributions of Heaven, 
<A NAME="757"></A>and by such punishments men should be deterred. But if they are not deterred, 
<A NAME="758"></A>and any one should be incited by some fatality to deprive his father or 
<A NAME="759"></A>mother, or brethren, or children, of life voluntarily and of purpose, for 
<A NAME="760"></A>him the earthly lawgiver legislates as follows:-There shall be the same 
<A NAME="761"></A>proclamations about outlawry, and there shall be the same sureties which 
<A NAME="762"></A>have been enacted in the former cases. But in his case, if he be convicted, 
<A NAME="763"></A>the servants of the judges and the magistrates shall slay him at an appointed 
<A NAME="764"></A>place without the city where three ways meet, and there expose his body 
<A NAME="765"></A>naked, and each of the magistrates on behalf of the whole city shall take 
<A NAME="766"></A>a stone and cast it upon the head of the dead man, and so deliver the city 
<A NAME="767"></A>from pollution; after that, they shall bear him to the borders of the land, 
<A NAME="768"></A>and cast him forth unburied, according to law. And what shall he suffer 
<A NAME="769"></A>who slays him who of all men, as they say, is his own best friend? I mean 
<A NAME="770"></A>the suicide, who deprives himself by violence of his appointed share of 
<A NAME="771"></A>life, not because the law of the state requires him, nor yet under the 
<A NAME="772"></A>compulsion of some painful and inevitable misfortune which has come upon 
<A NAME="773"></A>him, nor because he has had to suffer from irremediable and intolerable 
<A NAME="774"></A>shame, but who from sloth or want of manliness imposes upon himself an 
<A NAME="775"></A>unjust penalty. For him, what ceremonies there are to be of purification 
<A NAME="776"></A>and burial God knows, and about these the next of kin should enquire of 
<A NAME="777"></A>the interpreters and of the laws thereto relating, and do according to 
<A NAME="778"></A>their injunctions. They who meet their death in this way shall be buried 
<A NAME="779"></A>alone, and none shall be laid by their side; they shall be buried ingloriously 
<A NAME="780"></A>in the borders of the twelve portions the land, in such places as are uncultivated 
<A NAME="781"></A>and nameless, and no column or inscription shall mark the place of their 
<A NAME="782"></A>interment. And if a beast of burden or other animal cause the death of 
<A NAME="783"></A>any one, except in the case of anything of that kind happening to a competitor 
<A NAME="784"></A>in the public contests, the kinsmen of the deceased shall prosecute the 
<A NAME="785"></A>slayer for murder, and the wardens of the country, such, and so many as 
<A NAME="786"></A>the kinsmen appoint, shall try the cause, and let the beast when condemned 
<A NAME="787"></A>be slain by them, and let them cast it beyond the borders. And if any lifeless 
<A NAME="788"></A>thing deprive a man of life, except in the case of a thunderbolt or other 
<A NAME="789"></A>fatal dart sent from the Gods-whether a man is killed by lifeless objects, 
<A NAME="790"></A>falling upon him, or by his falling upon them, the nearest of kin shall 
<A NAME="791"></A>appoint the nearest neighbour to be a judge, and thereby acquit himself 
<A NAME="792"></A>and the whole family of guilt. And he shall cast forth the guilty thing 
<A NAME="793"></A>beyond the border, as has been said about the animals.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR><BR>If a man is found dead, and his murderer be unknown, and after 
<A NAME="795"></A>a diligent search cannot be detected, there shall be the same proclamation 
<A NAME="796"></A>as in the previous cases, and the same interdict on the murderer; and having 
<A NAME="797"></A>proceeded against him, they shall proclaim in the agora by a herald, that 
<A NAME="798"></A>he who has slain such and such a person, and has been convicted of murder, 
<A NAME="799"></A>shall not set his foot in the temples, nor at all in the country of the 
<A NAME="800"></A>murdered man, and if he appears and is discovered, he shall die, and be 
<A NAME="801"></A>cast forth unburied beyond the border. Let this one law then be laid down 
<A NAME="802"></A>by us about murder; and let cases of this sort be so 
<A NAME="803"></A>regarded.
<A NAME="804"></A><BR><BR>And now let us say in what cases and under what circumstances the 
<A NAME="805"></A>murderer is rightly free from guilt:-If a man catch a thief coming, into 
<A NAME="806"></A>his house by night to steal, and he take and kill him, or if he slay a 
<A NAME="807"></A>footpad in self-defence, he shall be guiltless. And any one who does violence 
<A NAME="808"></A>to a free woman or a youth, shall be slain with impunity by the injured 
<A NAME="809"></A>person, or by his or her father or brothers or sons. If a man find his 
<A NAME="810"></A>wife suffering violence, he may kill the violator, and be guiltless in 
<A NAME="811"></A>the eye of the law; or if a person kill another in warding off death from 
<A NAME="812"></A>his father or mother or children or brethren or wife who are doing no wrong, 
<A NAME="813"></A>he shall assuredly be guiltless.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR><BR>Thus much as to the nurture and education of the living soul of 
<A NAME="815"></A>man, having which, he can, and without which, if he unfortunately be without 
<A NAME="816"></A>them, he cannot live; and also concerning the punishments:-which are to 
<A NAME="817"></A>be inflicted for violent deaths, let thus much be enacted. Of the nurture 
<A NAME="818"></A>and education of the body we have spoken before, and next in order we have 
<A NAME="819"></A>to speak of deeds of violence, voluntary and involuntary, which men do 
<A NAME="820"></A>to one another; these we will now distinguish, as far as we are able, according 
<A NAME="821"></A>to their nature and number, and determine what will be the suitable penalties 
<A NAME="822"></A>of each, and so assign to them their proper place in the series of our 
<A NAME="823"></A>enactments. The poorest legislator will have no difficulty in determining 
<A NAME="824"></A>that wounds and mutilations arising out of wounds should follow next in 
<A NAME="825"></A>order after deaths. Let wounds be divided as homicides were divided-into 
<A NAME="826"></A>those which are involuntary, and which are given in passion or from fear, 
<A NAME="827"></A>and those inflicted voluntarily and with premeditation. Concerning all 
<A NAME="828"></A>this, we must make some such proclamation as the following:-Mankind must 
<A NAME="829"></A>have laws, and conform to them, or their life would be as bad as that of 
<A NAME="830"></A>the most savage beast. And the reason of this is that no man's nature is 
<A NAME="831"></A>able to know what is best for human society; or knowing, always able and 
<A NAME="832"></A>willing to do what is best. In the first place, there is a difficulty in 
<A NAME="833"></A>apprehending that the true art or politics is concerned, not with private 
<A NAME="834"></A>but with public good (for public good binds together states, but private 
<A NAME="835"></A>only distracts them); and that both the public and private good as well 
<A NAME="836"></A>of individuals as of states is greater when the state and not the individual 
<A NAME="837"></A>is first considered. In the second place, although a person knows in the 
<A NAME="838"></A>abstract that this is true, yet if he be possessed of absolute and irresponsible 
<A NAME="839"></A>power, he will never remain firm in his principles or persist in regarding 
<A NAME="840"></A>the public good as primary in the state, and the private good as secondary. 
<A NAME="841"></A>Human nature will be always drawing him into avarice and selfishness, avoiding 
<A NAME="842"></A>pain and pursuing Pleasure without any reason, and will bring these to 
<A NAME="843"></A>the front, obscuring the juster and better; and so working darkness in 
<A NAME="844"></A>his soul will at last fill with evils both him and the whole city. For 
<A NAME="845"></A>if a man were born so divinely gifted that he could naturally apprehend 
<A NAME="846"></A>the truth, he would have no need of laws to rule over him; for there is 
<A NAME="847"></A>no law or order which is above knowledge, nor can mind, without impiety, 
<A NAME="848"></A>be deemed the subject or slave of any man, but rather the lord of all. 
<A NAME="849"></A>I speak of mind, true and free, and in harmony with nature. But then there 
<A NAME="850"></A>is no such mind anywhere, or at least not much; and therefore we must choose 
<A NAME="851"></A>law and order, which are second best. These look at things as they exist 
<A NAME="852"></A>for the most part only, and are unable to survey the whole of them. And 
<A NAME="853"></A>therefore I have spoken as I have.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><BR>And now we will determine what penalty he ought to pay or suffer 
<A NAME="855"></A>who has hurt or wounded another. Any one may easily imagine the questions 
<A NAME="856"></A>which have to be asked in all such cases:-What did he wound, or whom, or 
<A NAME="857"></A>how, or when? for there are innumerable particulars of this sort which 
<A NAME="858"></A>greatly vary from one another. And to allow courts of law to determine 
<A NAME="859"></A>all these things, or not to determine any of them, is alike impossible. 
<A NAME="860"></A>There is one particular which they must determine in all cases-the question 
<A NAME="861"></A>of fact. And then, again, that the legislator should not permit them to 
<A NAME="862"></A>determine what punishment is to be inflicted in any of these cases, but 
<A NAME="863"></A>should himself decide about, of them, small or great, is next to 
<A NAME="864"></A>impossible.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Then what is to be the inference?
<A NAME="866"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The inference is, that some things should be left to courts 
<A NAME="867"></A>of law; others the legislator must decide for himself.
<A NAME="868"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> And what ought the legislator to decide, and what ought 
<A NAME="869"></A>he to leave to courts of law?
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> I may reply, that in a state in which the courts are 
<A NAME="871"></A>bad and mute, because the judges conceal their opinions and decide causes 
<A NAME="872"></A>clandestinely; or what is worse, when they are disorderly and noisy, as 
<A NAME="873"></A>in a theatre, clapping or hooting in turn this or that orator-I say that 
<A NAME="874"></A>then there is a very serious evil, which affects the whole state. Unfortunate 
<A NAME="875"></A>is the necessity of having to legislate for such courts, but where the 
<A NAME="876"></A>necessity exists, the legislator should only allow them to ordain the penalties 
<A NAME="877"></A>for the smallest offences; if the state for which he is legislating be 
<A NAME="878"></A>of this character, he must take most matters into his own hands and speak 
<A NAME="879"></A>distinctly. But when a state has good courts, and the judges are well trained 
<A NAME="880"></A>and scrupulously tested, the determination of the penalties or punishments 
<A NAME="881"></A>which shall be inflicted on the guilty may fairly and with advantage be 
<A NAME="882"></A>left to them. And we are not to be blamed for not legislating concerning 
<A NAME="883"></A>all that large class of matters which judges far worse educated than ours 
<A NAME="884"></A>would be able to determine, assigning to each offence what is due both 
<A NAME="885"></A>to the perpetrator and to the sufferer. We believe those for whom we are 
<A NAME="886"></A>legislating to be best able to judge, and therefore to them the greater 
<A NAME="887"></A>part may be left. At the same time, as I have often said, we should exhibit 
<A NAME="888"></A>to the judges, as we have done, the outline and form of the punishments 
<A NAME="889"></A>to be inflicted, and then they will not transgress the just rule. That 
<A NAME="890"></A>was an excellent practice, which we observed before, and which now that 
<A NAME="891"></A>we are resuming the work of legislation, may with advantage be repeated 
<A NAME="892"></A>by us.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR>Let the enactment about wounding be in the following terms:-If 
<A NAME="894"></A>anyone has a purpose and intention to slay another who is not his enemy, 
<A NAME="895"></A>and whom the law does not permit him to slay, and he wounds him, but is 
<A NAME="896"></A>unable to kill him, he who had the intent and has wounded him is not to 
<A NAME="897"></A>be pitied-he deserves no consideration, but should be regarded as a murderer 
<A NAME="898"></A>and be tried for murder. Still having respect to the fortune which has 
<A NAME="899"></A>in a manner favoured him, and to the providence which in pity to him and 
<A NAME="900"></A>to the wounded man saved the one from a fatal blow, and the other from 
<A NAME="901"></A>an accursed fate and calamity-as a thank-offering to this deity, and in 
<A NAME="902"></A>order not to oppose his will-in such a case the law will remit the punishment 
<A NAME="903"></A>of death, and only compel the offender to emigrate to a neighbouring city 
<A NAME="904"></A>for the rest of his life, where he shall remain in the enjoyment of all 
<A NAME="905"></A>his possessions. But if he have injured the wounded man, he shall make 
<A NAME="906"></A>such compensation for the injury as the court deciding the cause shall 
<A NAME="907"></A>assess, and the same judges shall decide who would have decided if the 
<A NAME="908"></A>man had died of his wounds. And if a child intentionally wound his parents, 
<A NAME="909"></A>or a servant his master, death shall be the penalty. And if a brother ora 
<A NAME="910"></A>sister intentionally wound a brother or a sister, and is found guilty, 
<A NAME="911"></A>death shall be the penalty. And if a husband wound a wife, or a wife a 
<A NAME="912"></A>husband, with intent to kill, let him or her undergo perpetual exile; if 
<A NAME="913"></A>they have sons or daughters who are still young, the guardians shall take 
<A NAME="914"></A>care of their property, and have charge of the children as orphans. If 
<A NAME="915"></A>their sons are grown up, they shall be under no obligation to support the 
<A NAME="916"></A>exiled parent, but they shall possess the property themselves. And if he 
<A NAME="917"></A>who meets with such a misfortune has no children, the kindred of the exiled 
<A NAME="918"></A>man to the degree of sons of cousins, both on the male and female side, 
<A NAME="919"></A>shall meet together, and after taking counsel with the guardians of the 
<A NAME="920"></A>and the priests, shall appoint a 5040th citizen to be the heir of the house, 
<A NAME="921"></A>considering and reasoning that no house of all the 5040 belongs to the 
<A NAME="922"></A>inhabitant or to the whole family, but is the public and private property 
<A NAME="923"></A>of the state. Now the state should seek to have its houses as holy and 
<A NAME="924"></A>happy as possible. And if any one of the houses be unfortunate, and stained 
<A NAME="925"></A>with impiety, and the owner leave no posterity, but dies unmarried, or 
<A NAME="926"></A>married and childless, having suffered death as the penalty of murder or 
<A NAME="927"></A>some other crime committed against the Gods or against his fellow-citizens, 
<A NAME="928"></A>of which death is the penalty distinctly laid down in the law; or if any 
<A NAME="929"></A>of the citizens be in perpetual exile, and also childless, that house shall 
<A NAME="930"></A>first of all be purified and undergo expiation according to law; and then 
<A NAME="931"></A>let the kinsmen of the house, as we were just now saying, and the guardians 
<A NAME="932"></A>of the law, meet and consider what family there is in the state which is 
<A NAME="933"></A>of the highest repute for virtue and also for good fortune, in which there 
<A NAME="934"></A>are a number of sons; from that family let them take one and introduce 
<A NAME="935"></A>him to the father and forefathers of the dead man as their son, and, for 
<A NAME="936"></A>the sake of the omen, let him be called so, that he may be the continuer 
<A NAME="937"></A>of their family, the keeper of their hearth, and the minister of their 
<A NAME="938"></A>sacred rites with better fortune than his father had; and when they have 
<A NAME="939"></A>made this supplication, they shall make him heir according to law, and 
<A NAME="940"></A>the offending person they shall leave nameless and childless and portionless 
<A NAME="941"></A>when calamities such as these overtake him.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR><BR>Now the boundaries of some things do not touch one another, but 
<A NAME="943"></A>there is a borderland which comes in between, preventing them from touching. 
<A NAME="944"></A>And we were saying that actions done from passion are of this nature, and 
<A NAME="945"></A>come in between the voluntary and involuntary. If a person be convicted 
<A NAME="946"></A>of having inflicted wounds in a passion, in the first place he shall pay 
<A NAME="947"></A>twice the amount of the injury, if the wound be curable, or, if incurable, 
<A NAME="948"></A>four times the amount of the injury; or if the wound be curable, and at 
<A NAME="949"></A>the same time cause great and notable disgrace to the wounded person, he 
<A NAME="950"></A>shall pay fourfold. And whenever any one in wounding another injures not 
<A NAME="951"></A>only the sufferer, but also the city, and makes him incapable of defending 
<A NAME="952"></A>his country against the enemy, he, besides the other penalties, shall pay 
<A NAME="953"></A>a penalty for the loss which the state has incurred. And the penalty shall 
<A NAME="954"></A>be, that in addition to his own times of service, he shall serve on behalf 
<A NAME="955"></A>of the disabled person, and shall take his place in war; or, if he refuse, 
<A NAME="956"></A>he shall be liable to be convicted by law of refusal to serve. The compensation 
<A NAME="957"></A>for the injury, whether to be twofold or threefold or fourfold, shall be 
<A NAME="958"></A>fixed by the judges who convict him. And if, in like manner, a brother 
<A NAME="959"></A>wounds a brother, the parents and kindred of either sex, including the 
<A NAME="960"></A>children of cousins, whether on the male or female side, shall meet, and 
<A NAME="961"></A>when they have judged the cause, they shall entrust the assessment of damages 
<A NAME="962"></A>to the parents, as is natural; and if the estimate be disputed, then the 
<A NAME="963"></A>kinsmen on the male side shall make the estimate, or if they cannot, they 
<A NAME="964"></A>shall commit the matter to the guardians of the law. And when similar charges 
<A NAME="965"></A>of wounding are brought by children against their parents, those who are 
<A NAME="966"></A>more than sixty years of age, having children of their own, not adopted, 
<A NAME="967"></A>shall be required to decide; and if any one is convicted, they shall determine 
<A NAME="968"></A>whether he or she ought to die, or suffer some other punishment either 
<A NAME="969"></A>greater than death, or, at any rate, not much less. A kinsman of the offender 
<A NAME="970"></A>shall not be allowed to judge the cause, not even if he be of the age which 
<A NAME="971"></A>is prescribed by the law. If a slave in a fit of anger wound a freeman, 
<A NAME="972"></A>the owner of the slave shall give him up to the wounded man, who may do 
<A NAME="973"></A>as he pleases with him, and if be not give him up he shall himself make 
<A NAME="974"></A>good the injury. And if any one says that the slave and the wounded man 
<A NAME="975"></A>are conspiring together, let him argue the point, and if he is cast, he 
<A NAME="976"></A>shall pay for the wrong three times over, but if he gains his case, the 
<A NAME="977"></A>freeman who conspired with the slave shall reliable to an action for kidnapping. 
<A NAME="978"></A>And if any one unintentionally wounds another he shall simply pay for the 
<A NAME="979"></A>harm, for no legislator is able to control chance. In such a case the judges 
<A NAME="980"></A>shall be the same as those who are appointed in the case of children suing 
<A NAME="981"></A>their parents; and they shall estimate the amount of the 
<A NAME="982"></A>injury.
<A NAME="983"></A><BR><BR>All the preceding injuries and every kind of assault are deeds 
<A NAME="984"></A>of violence; and every man, woman, or child ought to consider that the 
<A NAME="985"></A>elder has the precedence of the younger in honour, both among the Gods 
<A NAME="986"></A>and also among men who would live in security and happiness. Wherefore 
<A NAME="987"></A>it is a foul thing and hateful to the Gods to see an elder man assaulted 
<A NAME="988"></A>by a younger in the city; and it is reasonable that a young man when struck 
<A NAME="989"></A>by an elder should lightly endure his anger, laying up in store for himself 
<A NAME="990"></A>a like honour when he is old. Let this be the law:-Every one shall reverence 
<A NAME="991"></A>his elder in word and deed; he shall respect any one who is twenty years 
<A NAME="992"></A>older than himself, whether male or female, regarding him or her as his 
<A NAME="993"></A>father or mother; and he shall abstain from laying hands on any one who 
<A NAME="994"></A>is of an age to have been his father or his mother, out of reverence to 
<A NAME="995"></A>the Gods who preside over birth; similarly he shall keep his hands from 
<A NAME="996"></A>a stranger, whether he be an old inhabitant or newly arrived; he shall 
<A NAME="997"></A>not venture to correct such an one by blows, either as the aggressor or 
<A NAME="998"></A>in self-defence. If he thinks that some stranger has struck him out of 
<A NAME="999"></A>wantonness or insolence, and ought to be punished, he shall take him to 
<A NAME="1000"></A>the wardens of the city, but let him not strike him, that the stranger 
<A NAME="1001"></A>may be kept far away from the possibility of lifting up his hand against 
<A NAME="1002"></A>a citizen, and let the wardens of the city take the offender and examine 
<A NAME="1003"></A>him, not forgetting their duty to the God of Strangers, and in case the 
<A NAME="1004"></A>stranger appears to have struck the citizen unjustly, let them inflict 
<A NAME="1005"></A>upon him as many blows with the scourge as he has himself inflicted, and 
<A NAME="1006"></A>quell his presumption. But if he be innocent, they shall threaten and rebuke 
<A NAME="1007"></A>the man who arrested him, and let them both go. If a person strikes another 
<A NAME="1008"></A>of the same age or somewhat older than himself, who has no children, whether 
<A NAME="1009"></A>he be an old man who strikes an old man or a young man who strikes a young 
<A NAME="1010"></A>man, let the person struck defend himself in the natural way without a 
<A NAME="1011"></A>weapon and with his hands only. He who, being more than forty years of 
<A NAME="1012"></A>age, dares to fight with another, whether he be the aggressor or in self 
<A NAME="1013"></A>defence, shall be regarded as rude and ill-mannered and slavish;-this will 
<A NAME="1014"></A>be a disgraceful punishment, and therefore suitable to him. The obedient 
<A NAME="1015"></A>nature will readily yield to such exhortations, but the disobedient, who 
<A NAME="1016"></A>heeds not the prelude, shall have the law ready for him:-If any man smite 
<A NAME="1017"></A>another who is older than himself, either by twenty or by more years, in 
<A NAME="1018"></A>the first place, he who is at hand, not being younger than the combatants, 
<A NAME="1019"></A>nor their equal in age, shall separate them, or be disgraced according 
<A NAME="1020"></A>to law; but if he be the equal in age of the person who is struck or younger, 
<A NAME="1021"></A>he shall defend the person injured as he would a brother or father or still 
<A NAME="1022"></A>older relative. Further, let him who dares to smite an elder be tried for 
<A NAME="1023"></A>assault, as I have said, and if he be found guilty, let him be imprisoned 
<A NAME="1024"></A>for a period of not less than a year, or if the judges approve of a longer 
<A NAME="1025"></A>period, their decision shall be final. But if a stranger or metic smite 
<A NAME="1026"></A>one who is older by twenty years or more, the same law shall hold about 
<A NAME="1027"></A>the bystanders assisting, and he who is found guilty in such a suit, if 
<A NAME="1028"></A>he be a stranger but not resident, shall be imprisoned during a period 
<A NAME="1029"></A>of two years; and a metic who disobeys the laws shall be imprisoned for 
<A NAME="1030"></A>three years, unless the court assign him a longer term. And let him who 
<A NAME="1031"></A>was present in any of these cases and did not assist according to law be 
<A NAME="1032"></A>punished, if he be of the highest dass, by paying a fine of a mina; or 
<A NAME="1033"></A>if he be of the second class, of fifty drachmas; or if of the third class, 
<A NAME="1034"></A>by a fine of thirty drachmas; or if he be of the fourth class, by a fine 
<A NAME="1035"></A>of twenty drachmas; and the generals and taxiarchs and phylarchs and hipparchs 
<A NAME="1036"></A>shall form the court in such cases.
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR><BR>Laws are partly framed for the sake of good men, in order to instruct 
<A NAME="1038"></A>them how they thay live on friendly terms with one another, and partly 
<A NAME="1039"></A>for the sake of those who refuse to be instructed, whose spirit cannot 
<A NAME="1040"></A>be subdued, or softened, or hindered from plunging into evil. These are 
<A NAME="1041"></A>the persons who cause the word to be spoken which I am about to utter; 
<A NAME="1042"></A>for them the legislator legislates of necessity, and in the hope that there 
<A NAME="1043"></A>may be no need of his laws. He who shall dare to lay violent hands upon 
<A NAME="1044"></A>his father or mother, or any still older relative, having no fear either 
<A NAME="1045"></A>of the wrath of the Gods above, or of the punishments that are spoken of 
<A NAME="1046"></A>in the world below, but transgresses in contempt of ancient and universal 
<A NAME="1047"></A>traditions as though he were too wise to believe in them, requires some 
<A NAME="1048"></A>extreme measure of prevention. Now death is not the worst that can happen 
<A NAME="1049"></A>to men; far worse are the punishments which are said to pursue them in 
<A NAME="1050"></A>the world below. But although they are most true tales, they work on such 
<A NAME="1051"></A>souls no prevention; for if they had any effect there would be no slayers 
<A NAME="1052"></A>of mothers, or impious hands lifted up against parents; and therefore the 
<A NAME="1053"></A>punishments of this world which are inflicted during life ought not in 
<A NAME="1054"></A>such cases to fall short, if possible, of the terrors of the world below. 
<A NAME="1055"></A>Let our enactment then be as follows:-If a man dare to strike his father 
<A NAME="1056"></A>or his mother, or their fathers or mothers, he being at the time of sound 
<A NAME="1057"></A>mind, then let any one who is at hand come to the rescue as has been already 
<A NAME="1058"></A>said, and the metic or stranger who comes to the rescue shall be called 
<A NAME="1059"></A>to the first place in the games; but if he do not come he shall suffer 
<A NAME="1060"></A>the punishment of perpetual exile. He who is not a metic, if he comes to 
<A NAME="1061"></A>the rescue, shall have praise, and if he do not come, blame. And if a slave 
<A NAME="1062"></A>come to the rescue, let him be made free, but if he do not come the rescue, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>let him receive 100 strokes of the whip, by order of the wardens of the 
<A NAME="1064"></A>agora, if the occurrence take place in the agora; or if somewhere in the 
<A NAME="1065"></A>city beyond the limits of the agora, any warden of the city is in residence 
<A NAME="1066"></A>shall punish him; or if in the country, then the commanders of the wardens 
<A NAME="1067"></A>of the country. If those who are near at the time be inhabitants of the 
<A NAME="1068"></A>same place, whether they be youths, or men, or women, let them come to 
<A NAME="1069"></A>the rescue and denounce him as the impious one; and he who does not come 
<A NAME="1070"></A>to the rescue shall fall under the curse of Zeus, the God of kindred and 
<A NAME="1071"></A>of ancestors, according to law. And if any one is found guilty of assaulting 
<A NAME="1072"></A>a parent, let him in the first place be for ever banished from the city 
<A NAME="1073"></A>into the country, and let him abstain from the temples; and if he do not 
<A NAME="1074"></A>abstain, the wardens of the country shall punish him with blows, or in 
<A NAME="1075"></A>any way which they please, and if he return he shall be put to death. And 
<A NAME="1076"></A>if any freeman eat or drink, or have any other sort of intercourse with 
<A NAME="1077"></A>him, or only meeting him have voluntarily touched him, he shall not enter 
<A NAME="1078"></A>into any temple, nor into the agora, nor into the city, until he is purified; 
<A NAME="1079"></A>for he should consider that he has become tainted by a curse. And if he 
<A NAME="1080"></A>disobeys the law, and pollutes the city and the temples contrary to law, 
<A NAME="1081"></A>and one of the magistrates sees him and does not indict him, when he gives 
<A NAME="1082"></A>in his account this omission shall be a most serious 
<A NAME="1083"></A>charge.
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR><BR>If a slave strike a freeman, whether a stranger or a citizen, let 
<A NAME="1085"></A>any one who is present come to the rescue, or pay the penalty already mentioned; 
<A NAME="1086"></A>and let the bystanders bind him, and deliver him up to the injured person, 
<A NAME="1087"></A>and he receiving him shall put him in chains, and inflict on him as many 
<A NAME="1088"></A>stripes as he pleases; but having punished him he must surrender him to 
<A NAME="1089"></A>his master according to law, and not deprive him of his property. Let the 
<A NAME="1090"></A>law be as follows:-The slave who strikes a freeman, not at the command 
<A NAME="1091"></A>of the magistrates, his owner shall receive bound from the man whom he 
<A NAME="1092"></A>has stricken, and not release him until the slave has persuaded the man 
<A NAME="1093"></A>whom he has stricken that he ought to be released. And let there be the 
<A NAME="1094"></A>same laws about women in relation to women, about men and women in relation 
<A NAME="1095"></A>to one another.
