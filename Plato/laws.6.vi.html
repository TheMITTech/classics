<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Athenian Stranger. And now having made an end of the preliminaries we will 
<A NAME="11"></A>proceed to the appointment of magistracies.
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR><B>Cleinias.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="13"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In the ordering of a state there are two parts: first, 
<A NAME="14"></A>the number of the magistracies, and the mode of establishing them; and, 
<A NAME="15"></A>secondly, when they have been established, laws again will have to be provided 
<A NAME="16"></A>for each of them, suitable in nature and number. But before electing the 
<A NAME="17"></A>magistrates let us stop a little and say a word in season about the election 
<A NAME="18"></A>of them.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What have you got to say?
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> This is what I have to say; every one can see, that although 
<A NAME="21"></A>the work of legislation is a most important matter, yet if a well-ordered 
<A NAME="22"></A>city superadd to good laws unsuitable offices, not only will there be no 
<A NAME="23"></A>use in having the good laws-not only will they be ridiculous and useless, 
<A NAME="24"></A>but the greatest political injury and evil will accrue from 
<A NAME="25"></A>them.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then now, my friend, let us observe what will happen in 
<A NAME="28"></A>the constitution of out intended state. In the first place, you will acknowledge 
<A NAME="29"></A>that those who are duly appointed to magisterial power, and their families, 
<A NAME="30"></A>should severally have given satisfactory proof of what they are, from youth 
<A NAME="31"></A>upward until the time of election; in the next place, those who are to 
<A NAME="32"></A>elect should have been trained in habits of law, and be well educated, 
<A NAME="33"></A>that they may have a right judgment, and may be able to select or reject 
<A NAME="34"></A>men whom they approve or disapprove, as they are worthy of either. But 
<A NAME="35"></A>how can we imagine that those who are brought together for the first time, 
<A NAME="36"></A>and are strangers to one another, and also uneducated, will avoid making 
<A NAME="37"></A>mistakes in the choice of magistrates?
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Impossible.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The matter is serious, and excuses will not serve the turn. 
<A NAME="40"></A>I will tell you, then, what you and I will have to do, since you, as you 
<A NAME="41"></A>tell me, with nine others, have offered to settle the new state on behalf 
<A NAME="42"></A>of the people of Crete, and I am to help you by the invention of the present 
<A NAME="43"></A>romance. I certainly should not like to leave the tale wandering all over 
<A NAME="44"></A>the world without a head;-a headless monster is such a hideous 
<A NAME="45"></A>thing.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Excellent, Stranger.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes; and I will be as good as my word.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Let us by all means do as you propose.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> That we will, by the grace of God, if old age will only 
<A NAME="50"></A>permit us.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> But God will be gracious.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes; and under his guidance let us consider further 
<A NAME="53"></A>point.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us remember what a courageously mad and daring creation 
<A NAME="56"></A>this our city is.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What had you in your mind when you said 
<A NAME="58"></A>that?
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I had in my mind the free and easy manner in which we are 
<A NAME="60"></A>ordaining that the inexperienced colonists shall receive our laws. Now 
<A NAME="61"></A>a man need not be very wise, Cleinias, in order to see that no one can 
<A NAME="62"></A>easily receive laws at their first imposition. But if we could anyhow wait 
<A NAME="63"></A>until those who have been imbued with them from childhood, and have been 
<A NAME="64"></A>nurtured in them, and become habituated to them, take their part in the 
<A NAME="65"></A>public elections of the state; I say, if this could be accomplished, and 
<A NAME="66"></A>rightly accomplished by any way or contrivance-then, I think that there 
<A NAME="67"></A>would be very little danger, at the end of the time, of a state thus trained 
<A NAME="68"></A>not being permanent.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> A reasonable supposition.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then let us consider if we can find any way out of the 
<A NAME="71"></A>difficulty; for I maintain, Cleinias, that the Cnosians, above all the 
<A NAME="72"></A>other Cretans, should not be satisfied with barely discharging their duty 
<A NAME="73"></A>to the colony, but they ought to take the utmost pains to establish the 
<A NAME="74"></A>offices which are first created by them in the best and surest manner. 
<A NAME="75"></A>Above all, this applies to the selection of the guardians of the law, who 
<A NAME="76"></A>must be chosen first of all, and with the greatest care; the others are 
<A NAME="77"></A>of less importance.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What method can we devise of electing 
<A NAME="79"></A>them?
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> This will be the method:-Sons of the Cretans, I shall say 
<A NAME="81"></A>to them, inasmuch as the Cnosians have precedence over the other states, 
<A NAME="82"></A>they should, in common with those who join this settlement, choose a body 
<A NAME="83"></A>of thirty-seven in all, nineteen of them being taken from the settlers, 
<A NAME="84"></A>and the remainder from the citizens of Cnosus. Of those latter the Cnosians 
<A NAME="85"></A>shall make a present to your colony, and you yourself shall be one of the 
<A NAME="86"></A>eighteen, and shall become a citizen of the new state; and if you and they 
<A NAME="87"></A>cannot be persuaded to go, the Cnosians may fairly use a little violence 
<A NAME="88"></A>in order to make you.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> But why, Stranger, do not you and Megillus take a part 
<A NAME="90"></A>in our new city?
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>Ath. O, Cleinias, Athens is proud, and Sparta too; and they are 
<A NAME="92"></A>both a long way off. But you and likewise the other colonists are conveniently 
<A NAME="93"></A>situated as you describe. I have been speaking of the way in which the 
<A NAME="94"></A>new citizens may be best managed under present circumstances; but in after-ages, 
<A NAME="95"></A>if the city continues to exist, let the election be on this wise. All who 
<A NAME="96"></A>are horse or foot soldiers, or have seen military service at the proper 
<A NAME="97"></A>ages when they were severally fitted for it, shall share in the election 
<A NAME="98"></A>of magistrates; and the election shall be held in whatever temple the state 
<A NAME="99"></A>deems most venerable, and every one shall carry his vote to the altar of 
<A NAME="100"></A>the God, writing down on a tablet the name of the person for whom he votes, 
<A NAME="101"></A>and his father's name, and his tribe, and ward; and at the side he shall 
<A NAME="102"></A>write his own name in like manner. Any one who pleases may take away any 
<A NAME="103"></A>tablet which he does not think properly filled up, and exhibit it in the 
<A NAME="104"></A>Agara for a period of not less than thirty days. The tablets which are 
<A NAME="105"></A>judged to be first, to the number of 300, shall be shown by the magistrates 
<A NAME="106"></A>to the whole city, and the citizens shall in like manner select from these 
<A NAME="107"></A>the candidates whom they prefer; and this second selection, to the number 
<A NAME="108"></A>of 100, shall be again exhibited to the citizens; in the third, let any 
<A NAME="109"></A>one who pleases select whom pleases out of the 100, walking through the 
<A NAME="110"></A>parts of victims, and let them choose for magistrates and proclaim the 
<A NAME="111"></A>seven and thirty who have the greatest number of votes. But who, Cleinias 
<A NAME="112"></A>and Megillus, will order for us in the colony all this matter of the magistrates, 
<A NAME="113"></A>and the scrutinies of them? If we reflect, we shall see that cities which 
<A NAME="114"></A>are in process of construction like ours must have some such persons, who 
<A NAME="115"></A>cannot possibly be elected before there are any magistrates; and yet they 
<A NAME="116"></A>must be elected in some way, and they are not to be inferior men, but the 
<A NAME="117"></A>best possible. For as the proverb says, "a good beginning is half the business"; 
<A NAME="118"></A>and "to have begun well" is praised by all, and in my opinion is a great 
<A NAME="119"></A>deal more than half the business, and has never been praised by any one 
<A NAME="120"></A>enough.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That is very true.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then let us recognize the difficulty, and make clear to 
<A NAME="123"></A>our own minds how the beginning is to be accomplished. There is only one 
<A NAME="124"></A>proposal which I have to offer, and that is one which, under our circumstances, 
<A NAME="125"></A>is both necessary and expedient.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I maintain that this colony of ours has a father and mother, 
<A NAME="128"></A>who are no other than the colonizing state. Well I know that many colonies 
<A NAME="129"></A>have been, and will be, at enmity with their parents. But in early days 
<A NAME="130"></A>the child, as in a family, loves and is beloved; even if there come a time 
<A NAME="131"></A>later when the tie is broken, still, while he is in want of education, 
<A NAME="132"></A>he naturally loves his parents and is beloved by them, and flies to his 
<A NAME="133"></A>relatives for protection, and finds in them his only natural allies in 
<A NAME="134"></A>time of need; and this parental feeling already exists in the Cnosians, 
<A NAME="135"></A>as is shown by their care of the new city; and there is a similar feeling 
<A NAME="136"></A>on the part of the young city towards Cnosus. And I repeat what I was saying-for 
<A NAME="137"></A>there is no harm in repeating a good thing-that the Cnosians should take 
<A NAME="138"></A>a common interest in all these matters, and choose, as far as they can, 
<A NAME="139"></A>the eldest and best of the colonists, to the number of not less than a 
<A NAME="140"></A>hundred; and let there be another hundred of the Cnosians themselves. These, 
<A NAME="141"></A>I say, on their arrival, should have a joint care that the magistrates 
<A NAME="142"></A>should be appointed according to law, and that when they are appointed 
<A NAME="143"></A>they should undergo a scrutiny. When this has been effected, the Cnosians 
<A NAME="144"></A>shall return home, and the new city do the best she can for her own preservation 
<A NAME="145"></A>and happiness. I would have the seven-and-thirty now, and in all future 
<A NAME="146"></A>time, chosen to fulfil the following duties:-Let them, in the first place, 
<A NAME="147"></A>be the guardians of the law; and, secondly, of the registers in which each 
<A NAME="148"></A>one registers before the magistrate the amount of his property, excepting 
<A NAME="149"></A>four minae which are allowed to citizens of the first class, three allowed 
<A NAME="150"></A>to the second, two to the third, and a single mina to the fourth. And if 
<A NAME="151"></A>any one, despising the laws for the sake of gain, be found to possess anything 
<A NAME="152"></A>more which has not been registered, let all that he has in excess be confiscated, 
<A NAME="153"></A>and let him be liable to a suit which shall be the reverse of honourable 
<A NAME="154"></A>or fortunate. And let any one who will, indict him on the charge of loving 
<A NAME="155"></A>base gains, and proceed against him before the guardians of the law. And 
<A NAME="156"></A>if he be cast, let him lose his share of the public possessions, and when 
<A NAME="157"></A>there is any public distribution, let him have nothing but his original 
<A NAME="158"></A>lot; and let him be written down a condemned man as long as he lives, in 
<A NAME="159"></A>some place in which any one who pleases can read about his onces. The guardian 
<A NAME="160"></A>of the law shall not hold office longer than twenty years, and shall not 
<A NAME="161"></A>be less than fifty years of age when he is elected; or if he is elected 
<A NAME="162"></A>when he is sixty years of age, he shall hold office for ten years only; 
<A NAME="163"></A>and upon the same principle, he must not imagine that he will be permitted 
<A NAME="164"></A>to hold such an important office as that of guardian of the laws after 
<A NAME="165"></A>he is seventy years of age, if he live so long.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>These are the three first ordinances about the guardians of the 
<A NAME="167"></A>law; as the work of legislation progresses, each law in turn will assign 
<A NAME="168"></A>to them their further duties. And now we may proceed in order to speak 
<A NAME="169"></A>of the election of other officers; for generals have to be elected, and 
<A NAME="170"></A>these again must have their ministers, commanders, and colonels of horse, 
<A NAME="171"></A>and commanders of brigades of foot, who would be more rightly called by 
<A NAME="172"></A>their popular name of brigadiers. The guardians of the law shall propose 
<A NAME="173"></A>as generals men who are natives of the city, and a selection from the candidates 
<A NAME="174"></A>proposed shall be made by those who are or have been of the age for military 
<A NAME="175"></A>service. And if one who is not proposed is thought by somebody to be better 
<A NAME="176"></A>than one who is, let him name whom he prefers in the place of whom, and 
<A NAME="177"></A>make oath that he is better, and propose him; and whichever of them is 
<A NAME="178"></A>approved by vote shall be admitted to the final selection; and the three 
<A NAME="179"></A>who have the greatest number of votes shall be appointed generals, and 
<A NAME="180"></A>superintendents of military affairs, after previously undergoing a scrutiny, 
<A NAME="181"></A>like the guardians of the law. And let the generals thus elected propose 
<A NAME="182"></A>twelve brigadiers, one for each tribe; and there shall be a right of counterproposal 
<A NAME="183"></A>as in the case of the generals, and the voting and decision shall take 
<A NAME="184"></A>place in the same way. Until the prytanes and council are elected, the 
<A NAME="185"></A>guardians of the law shall convene the assembly in some holy spot which 
<A NAME="186"></A>is suitable to the purpose, placing the hoplites by themselves, and the 
<A NAME="187"></A>cavalry by themselves, and in a third division all the rest of the army. 
<A NAME="188"></A>All are to vote for the generals [and for the colonels of horse], but the 
<A NAME="189"></A>brigadiers are to be voted for only by those who carry shields [i.e. the 
<A NAME="190"></A>hoplites]. Let the body of cavalry choose phylarchs for the generals; but 
<A NAME="191"></A>captains of light troops, or archers, or any other division of the army, 
<A NAME="192"></A>shall be appointed by the generals for themselves. There only remains the 
<A NAME="193"></A>appointment of officers of cavalry: these shall be proposed by the same 
<A NAME="194"></A>persons who proposed the generals, and the election and the counter-proposal 
<A NAME="195"></A>of other candidates shall be arranged in the same way as in the case of 
<A NAME="196"></A>the generals, and let the cavalry vote and the infantry look on at the 
<A NAME="197"></A>election; the two who have the greatest number of votes shall be the leaders 
<A NAME="198"></A>of all the horse. Disputes about the voting may be raised once or twice; 
<A NAME="199"></A>but if the dispute be raised a third time, the officers who preside at 
<A NAME="200"></A>the several elections shall decide.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>The council shall consist of 30 x 12 members-360 will be a convenient 
<A NAME="202"></A>number for sub-division. If we divide the whole number into four parts 
<A NAME="203"></A>of ninety each, we get ninety counsellors for each class. First, all the 
<A NAME="204"></A>citizens shall select candidates from the first class; they shall be compelled 
<A NAME="205"></A>to vote, and, if they do not, shall be duly fined. When the candidates 
<A NAME="206"></A>have been selected, some one shall mark them down; this shall be the business 
<A NAME="207"></A>of the first day. And on the following day, candidates shall be selected 
<A NAME="208"></A>from the second class in the same manner and under the same conditions 
<A NAME="209"></A>as on the previous day; and on the third day a selection shall be made 
<A NAME="210"></A>from the third class, at which every one may, if he likes, vote, and the 
<A NAME="211"></A>three first classes shall be compelled to vote; but the fourth and lowest 
<A NAME="212"></A>class shall be under no compulsion, and any member of this class who does 
<A NAME="213"></A>not vote shall not be punished. On the fourth day candidates shall be selected 
<A NAME="214"></A>from the fourth and smallest class; they shall be selected by all, but 
<A NAME="215"></A>he who is of the fourth class shall suffer no penalty, nor he who is of 
<A NAME="216"></A>the third, if he be not willing to vote; but he who is of the first or 
<A NAME="217"></A>second class, if he does not vote shall be punished;-he who is of the second 
<A NAME="218"></A>class shall pay a fine of triple the amount which was exacted at first, 
<A NAME="219"></A>and he who is of the first class quadruple. On the fifth day the rulers 
<A NAME="220"></A>shall bring out the names noted down, for all the citizens to see, and 
<A NAME="221"></A>every man shall choose out of them, under pain, if he do not, of suffering 
<A NAME="222"></A>the first penalty; and when they have chosen out of each of the classes, 
<A NAME="223"></A>they shall choose one-half of them by lot, who shall undergo a scrutiny:-These 
<A NAME="224"></A>are to form the council for the year.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>The mode of election which has been described is in a mean between 
<A NAME="226"></A>monarchy and democracy, and such a mean the state ought always to observe; 
<A NAME="227"></A>for servants and masters never can be friends, nor good and bad, merely 
<A NAME="228"></A>because they are declared to have equal privileges. For to unequals equals 
<A NAME="229"></A>become unequal, if they are not harmonized by measure; and both by reason 
<A NAME="230"></A>of equality, and by reason of inequality, cities are filled with seditions. 
<A NAME="231"></A>The old saying, that "equality makes friendship," is happy and also true; 
<A NAME="232"></A>but there is obscurity and confusion as to what sort of equality is meant. 
<A NAME="233"></A>For there are two equalities which are called by the same name, but are 
<A NAME="234"></A>in reality in many ways almost the opposite of one another; one of them 
<A NAME="235"></A>may be introduced without difficulty, by any state or any legislator in 
<A NAME="236"></A>the distribution of honours: this is the rule of measure, weight, and number, 
<A NAME="237"></A>which regulates and apportions them. But there is another equality, of 
<A NAME="238"></A>a better and higher kind, which is not so easily recognized. This is the 
<A NAME="239"></A>judgment of Zeus; among men it avails but little; that little, however, 
<A NAME="240"></A>is the source of the greatest good to individuals and states. For it gives 
<A NAME="241"></A>to the greater more, and to the inferior less and in proportion to the 
<A NAME="242"></A>nature of each; and, above all, greater honour always to the greater virtue, 
<A NAME="243"></A>and to the less less; and to either in proportion to their respective measure 
<A NAME="244"></A>of virtue and education. And this is justice, and is ever the true principle 
<A NAME="245"></A>of states, at which we ought to aim, and according to this rule order the 
<A NAME="246"></A>new city which is now being founded, and any other city which may be hereafter 
<A NAME="247"></A>founded. To this the legislator should look-not to the interests of tyrants 
<A NAME="248"></A>one or more, or to the power of the people, but to justice always; which, 
<A NAME="249"></A>as I was saying, the distribution of natural equality among unequals in 
<A NAME="250"></A>each case. But there are times at which every state is compelled to use 
<A NAME="251"></A>the words, "just," "equal," in a secondary sense, in the hope of escaping 
<A NAME="252"></A>in some degree from factions. For equity and indulgence are infractions 
<A NAME="253"></A>of the perfect and strict rule of justice. And this is the reason why we 
<A NAME="254"></A>are obliged to use the equality of the lot, in order to avoid the discontent 
<A NAME="255"></A>of the people; and so we invoke God and fortune in our prayers, and beg 
<A NAME="256"></A>that they themselves will direct the lot with a view to supreme justice. 
<A NAME="257"></A>And therefore, although we are compelled to use both equalities, we should 
<A NAME="258"></A>use that into which the element of chance enters as seldom as 
<A NAME="259"></A>possible.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>Thus, O my friends, and for the reasons given, should a state act 
<A NAME="261"></A>which would endure and be saved. But as a ship sailing on the sea has to 
<A NAME="262"></A>be watched night and day, in like manner a city also is sailing on a sea 
<A NAME="263"></A>of politics, and is liable to all sorts of insidious assaults; and therefore 
<A NAME="264"></A>from morning to night, and from night to morning, rulers must join hands 
<A NAME="265"></A>with rulers, and watchers with watchers, receiving and giving up their 
<A NAME="266"></A>trust in a perpetual succession. Now a multitude can never fulfil a duty 
<A NAME="267"></A>of this sort with anything like energy. Moreover, the greater number of 
<A NAME="268"></A>the senators will have to be left during the greater part of the year to 
<A NAME="269"></A>order their concerns at their own homes. They will therefore have to be 
<A NAME="270"></A>arranged in twelve portions, answering to the twelve months, and furnish 
<A NAME="271"></A>guardians of the state, each portion for a single month. Their business 
<A NAME="272"></A>is to be at hand and receive any foreigner or citizen who comes to them, 
<A NAME="273"></A>whether to give information, or to put one of those questions, to which, 
<A NAME="274"></A>when asked by other cities, a city should give an answer, and to which, 
<A NAME="275"></A>if she ask them herself, she should receive an answer; or again, when there 
<A NAME="276"></A>is a likelihood of internal commotions, which are always liable to happen 
<A NAME="277"></A>in some form or other, they will, if they can, prevent their occurring; 
<A NAME="278"></A>or if they have already occurred, will lose time in making them known to 
<A NAME="279"></A>the city, and healing the evil. Wherefore, also, this which is the presiding 
<A NAME="280"></A>body of the state ought always to have the control of their assemblies, 
<A NAME="281"></A>and of the dissolutions of them, ordinary as well as extraordinary. All 
<A NAME="282"></A>this is to be ordered by the twelfth part of the council, which is always 
<A NAME="283"></A>to keep watch together with the other officers of the state during one 
<A NAME="284"></A>portion of the year, and to rest during the remaining eleven 
<A NAME="285"></A>portions.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>Thus will the city be fairly ordered. And now, who is to have, 
<A NAME="287"></A>the superintendence of the country, and what shall be the arrangement? 
<A NAME="288"></A>Seeing that the whole city and the entire country have been both of them 
<A NAME="289"></A>divided into twelve portions, ought there not to be appointed superintendents 
<A NAME="290"></A>of the streets of the city, and of the houses, and buildings, and harbours, 
<A NAME="291"></A>and the agora, and fountains, and sacred domains, and temples, and the 
<A NAME="292"></A>like?
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To be sure there ought.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us assume, then, that there ought to be servants of 
<A NAME="295"></A>the temples, and priests and priestesses. There must also be superintendents 
<A NAME="296"></A>of roads and buddings, who will have a care of men, that they may do no 
<A NAME="297"></A>harm, and also of beasts, both within the enclosure and in the suburbs. 
<A NAME="298"></A>Three kinds of officers will thus have to be appointed, in order that the 
<A NAME="299"></A>city may be suitably provided according to her needs. Those who have the 
<A NAME="300"></A>care of the city shall be called wardens of the city; and those who have 
<A NAME="301"></A>the care of the agora shall be called wardens of the agora; and those who 
<A NAME="302"></A>have the care of the temples shall be called priests. Those who hold hereditary 
<A NAME="303"></A>offices as priests or priestesses, shall not be disturbed; but if there 
<A NAME="304"></A>be few or none such, as is probable at the foundation of a new city, priests 
<A NAME="305"></A>and priestesses shall be appointed to be servants of the Gods who have 
<A NAME="306"></A>no servants. Some of our officers shall be elected, and others appointed 
<A NAME="307"></A>by lot, those who are of the people and those who are not of the people 
<A NAME="308"></A>mingling in a friendly manner in every place and city, that the state may 
<A NAME="309"></A>be as far as possible of one mind. The officers of the temples shall be 
<A NAME="310"></A>appointed by lot; in this way their election will be committed to God, 
<A NAME="311"></A>that he may do what is agreeable to him. And he who obtains a lot shall 
<A NAME="312"></A>undergo a scrutiny, first, as to whether he is sound of body and of legitimate 
<A NAME="313"></A>birth; and in the second place, in order to show that he is of a perfectly 
<A NAME="314"></A>pure family, not stained with homicide or any similar impiety in his own 
<A NAME="315"></A>person, and also that his father and mother have led a similar unstained 
<A NAME="316"></A>life. Now the laws about all divine things should be brought from Delphi, 
<A NAME="317"></A>and interpreters appointed, under whose direction they should be used. 
<A NAME="318"></A>The tenure of the priesthood should always be for a year and no longer; 
<A NAME="319"></A>and he who will duly execute the sacred office, according to the laws of 
<A NAME="320"></A>religion, must be not less than sixty years of age-the laws shall be the 
<A NAME="321"></A>same about priestesses. As for the interpreters, they shall be appointed 
<A NAME="322"></A>thus:-Let the twelve tribes be distributed into groups of four, and let 
<A NAME="323"></A>each group select four, one out of each tribe within the group, three times; 
<A NAME="324"></A>and let the three who have the greatest number of votes [out of the twelve 
<A NAME="325"></A>appointed by each group], after undergoing a scrutiny, nine in all, be 
<A NAME="326"></A>sent to Delphi, in order that the God may return one out of each triad; 
<A NAME="327"></A>their age shall be the same as that of the priests, and the scrutiny of 
<A NAME="328"></A>them shall be conducted in the same manner; let them be interpreters for 
<A NAME="329"></A>life, and when any one dies let the four tribes select another from the 
<A NAME="330"></A>tribe of the deceased. Moreover, besides priests and interpreters, there 
<A NAME="331"></A>must be treasurers, who will take charge of the property of the several 
<A NAME="332"></A>temples, and of the sacred domains, and shall have authority over the produce 
<A NAME="333"></A>and the letting of them; and three of them shall be chosen from the highest 
<A NAME="334"></A>classes for the greater temples, and two for the lesser, and one for the 
<A NAME="335"></A>least of all; the manner of their election and the scrutiny of them shall 
<A NAME="336"></A>be the same as that of the generals. This shall be the order of the 
<A NAME="337"></A>temples.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>Let everything have a guard as far as possible. Let the defence 
<A NAME="339"></A>of the city be commited to the generals, and taxiarchs, and hipparchs, 
<A NAME="340"></A>and phylarchs, and prytanes, and the wardens of the city, and of the agora, 
<A NAME="341"></A>when the election of them has been completed. The defence of the country 
<A NAME="342"></A>shall be provided for as follows:-The entire land has been already distributed 
<A NAME="343"></A>into twelve as nearly as possible equal parts, and let the tribe allotted 
<A NAME="344"></A>to a division provide annually for it five wardens of the country and commanders 
<A NAME="345"></A>of the watch; and let each body of five have the power of selecting twelve 
<A NAME="346"></A>others out of the youth of their own tribe-these shall be not less than 
<A NAME="347"></A>twenty-five years of age, and not more than thirty. And let there be allotted 
<A NAME="348"></A>to them severally every month the various districts, in order that they 
<A NAME="349"></A>may all acquire knowledge and experience of the whole country. The term 
<A NAME="350"></A>of service for commanders and for watchers shall continue during two years. 
<A NAME="351"></A>After having had their stations allotted to them, they will go from place 
<A NAME="352"></A>to place in regular order, making their round from left to right as their 
<A NAME="353"></A>commanders direct them; (when I speak of going to the right, I mean that 
<A NAME="354"></A>they are to go to the east). And at the commencement of the second year, 
<A NAME="355"></A>in order that as many as possible of the guards may not only get a knowledge 
<A NAME="356"></A>of the country at any one season of the year, but may also have experience 
<A NAME="357"></A>of the manner in which different places are affected at different seasons 
<A NAME="358"></A>of the year, their then commanders shall lead them again towards the left, 
<A NAME="359"></A>from place to place in succession, until they have completed the second 
<A NAME="360"></A>year. In the third year other wardens of the country shall be chosen and 
<A NAME="361"></A>commanders of the watch, five for each division, who are to be the superintendents 
<A NAME="362"></A>of the bands of twelve. While on service at each station, their attention 
<A NAME="363"></A>shall be directed to the following points:-In the first place, they shall 
<A NAME="364"></A>see that the country is well protected against enemies; they shall trench 
<A NAME="365"></A>and dig wherever this is required, and, as far as they can, they shall 
<A NAME="366"></A>by fortifications keep off the evil-disposed, in order to prevent them 
<A NAME="367"></A>from doing any harm to the country or the property; they shall use the 
<A NAME="368"></A>beasts of burden and the labourers whom they find on the spot: these will 
<A NAME="369"></A>be their instruments whom they will superintend, taking them, as far as 
<A NAME="370"></A>possible, at the times when they are not engaged in their regular business. 
<A NAME="371"></A>They shall make every part of the country inaccessible to enemies, and 
<A NAME="372"></A>as accessible as possible to friends; there shall be ways for man and beasts 
<A NAME="373"></A>of burden and for cattle, and they shall take care to have them always 
<A NAME="374"></A>as smooth as they can; and shall provide against the rains doing harm instead 
<A NAME="375"></A>of good to the land, when they come down from the mountains into the hollow 
<A NAME="376"></A>dells; and shall keep in the overflow by the help of works and ditches, 
<A NAME="377"></A>in order that the valleys, receiving and drinking up the rain from heaven, 
<A NAME="378"></A>and providing fountains and streams in the fields and regions which lie 
<A NAME="379"></A>underneath, may furnish even to the dry places plenty of good water. The 
<A NAME="380"></A>fountains of water, whether of rivers or of springs, shall be ornamented 
<A NAME="381"></A>with plantations and buildings for beauty; and let them bring together 
<A NAME="382"></A>the streams in subterraneous channels, and make all things plenteous; and 
<A NAME="383"></A>if there be a sacred grove or dedicated precinct in the neighbourhood, 
<A NAME="384"></A>they shall conduct the water to the actual temples of the Gods, and so 
<A NAME="385"></A>beautify them at all seasons of the year. Everywhere in such places the 
<A NAME="386"></A>youth shall make gymnasia for themselves, and warm baths for the aged, 
<A NAME="387"></A>placing by them abundance of dry wood, for the benefit of those labouring 
<A NAME="388"></A>under disease-there the weary frame of the rustic, worn with toil, will 
<A NAME="389"></A>receive a kindly welcome, far better than he would at the hands of a not 
<A NAME="390"></A>over-wise doctor.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>The building of these and the like works will be useful and ornamental; 
<A NAME="392"></A>they will provide a pleasing amusement, but they will be a serious employment 
<A NAME="393"></A>too; for the sixty wardens will have to guard their several divisions, 
<A NAME="394"></A>not only with a view to enemies, but also with an eye to professing friends. 
<A NAME="395"></A>When a quarrel arises among neighbours or citizens, and any one, whether 
<A NAME="396"></A>slave or freeman wrongs another, let the five wardens decide small matters 
<A NAME="397"></A>on their own authority; but where the charge against another relates to 
<A NAME="398"></A>greater matters, the seventeen composed of the fives and twelves, shall 
<A NAME="399"></A>determine any charges which one man brings against another, not involving 
<A NAME="400"></A>more than three minae. Every judge and magistrate shall be liable to give 
<A NAME="401"></A>an account of his conduct in office, except those who, like kings, have 
<A NAME="402"></A>the final decision. Moreover, as regards the aforesaid wardens of the country, 
<A NAME="403"></A>if they do any wrong to those of whom they have the care, whether by imposing 
<A NAME="404"></A>upon them unequal tasks, or by taking the produce of the soil or implements 
<A NAME="405"></A>of husbandry without their consent; also if they receive anything in the 
<A NAME="406"></A>way of a bribe, or decide suits unjustly, or if they yield to the influences 
<A NAME="407"></A>of flattery, let them be publicly dishonoured; and in regard to any other 
<A NAME="408"></A>wrong which they do to the inhabitants of the country, if the question 
<A NAME="409"></A>be of a mina, let them submit to the decision of the villagers in the neighbourhood; 
<A NAME="410"></A>but in suits of greater amount, or in case of lesser, if they refuse to 
<A NAME="411"></A>submit, trusting that their monthly removal into another part of the country 
<A NAME="412"></A>will enable them to escape-in such cases the injured party may bring his 
<A NAME="413"></A>suit in the common court, and if he obtain a verdict he may exact from 
<A NAME="414"></A>the defendant, who refused to submit, a double penalty.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>The wardens and the overseers of the country, while on their two 
<A NAME="416"></A>years service, shall have common meals at their several stations, and shall 
<A NAME="417"></A>all live together; and he who is absent from the common meal, or sleeps 
<A NAME="418"></A>out, if only for one day or night, unless by order of his commanders, or 
<A NAME="419"></A>by reason of absolute necessity, if the five denounce him and inscribe 
<A NAME="420"></A>his name the agora as not having kept his guard, let him be deemed to have 
<A NAME="421"></A>betrayed the city, as far as lay in his power, and let him be disgraced 
<A NAME="422"></A>and beaten with impunity by any one who meets him and is willing to punish 
<A NAME="423"></A>him. If any of the commanders is guilty of such an irregularity, the whole 
<A NAME="424"></A>company of sixty shall see to it, and he who is cognizant of the offence, 
<A NAME="425"></A>and does not bring the offender to trial, shall be amenable to the same 
<A NAME="426"></A>laws as the younger offender himself, and shall pay a heavier fine, and 
<A NAME="427"></A>be incapable of ever commanding the young. The guardians of the law are 
<A NAME="428"></A>to be careful inspectors of these matters, and shall either prevent or 
<A NAME="429"></A>punish offenders. Every man should remember the universal rule, that he 
<A NAME="430"></A>who is not a good servant will not be a good master; a man should pride 
<A NAME="431"></A>himself more upon serving well than upon commanding well: first upon serving 
<A NAME="432"></A>the laws, which is also the service of the Gods; in the second place, upon 
<A NAME="433"></A>having. served ancient and honourable men in the days of his youth. Furthermore, 
<A NAME="434"></A>during the two years in which any one is a warden of the country, his daily 
<A NAME="435"></A>food ought to be of a simple and humble kind. When the twelve have been 
<A NAME="436"></A>chosen, let them and the five meet together, and determine that they will 
<A NAME="437"></A>be their own servants, and, like servants, will not have other slaves and 
<A NAME="438"></A>servants for their own use, neither will they use those of the villagers 
<A NAME="439"></A>and husbandmen for their private advantage, but for the public service 
<A NAME="440"></A>only; and in general they should make up their minds to live independently 
<A NAME="441"></A>by themselves, servants of each other and of themselves. Further, at all 
<A NAME="442"></A>seasons of the year, summer and winter alike, let them be under arms and 
<A NAME="443"></A>survey minutely the whole country; thus they will at once keep guard, and 
<A NAME="444"></A>at the same time acquire a perfect knowledge of every locality. There can 
<A NAME="445"></A>be no more important kind of information than the exact knowledge of a 
<A NAME="446"></A>man's own country; and for this as well as for more general reasons of 
<A NAME="447"></A>pleasure and advantage, hunting with dogs and other kinds of sports should 
<A NAME="448"></A>be pursued by the young. The service to whom this is committed may be called 
<A NAME="449"></A>the secret police, or wardens of the country; the name does not much signify, 
<A NAME="450"></A>but every one who has the safety of the state at heart will use his utmost 
<A NAME="451"></A>diligence in this service.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>After the wardens of the country, we have to speak of the election 
<A NAME="453"></A>of wardens of the agora and of the city. The wardens of the country were 
<A NAME="454"></A>sixty in number, and the wardens of the city will be three, and will divide 
<A NAME="455"></A>the twelve parts of the city into three; like the former, they shall have 
<A NAME="456"></A>care of the ways, and of the different high roads which lead out of the 
<A NAME="457"></A>country into the city, and of the buildings, that they may be all made 
<A NAME="458"></A>according to law;-also of the waters, which the guardians of the supply 
<A NAME="459"></A>preserve and convey to them, care being taken that they may reach the fountains 
<A NAME="460"></A>pure and abundant, and be both an ornament and a benefit to the city. These 
<A NAME="461"></A>also should be men of influence, and at leisure to take care of the public 
<A NAME="462"></A>interest. Let every man propose as warden of the city any one whom he likes 
<A NAME="463"></A>out of the highest class, and when the vote has been given on them, and 
<A NAME="464"></A>the number is reduced to the six who have the greatest number of votes, 
<A NAME="465"></A>let the electing officers choose by lot three out of the six, and when 
<A NAME="466"></A>they have undergone a scrutiny let them hold office according to the laws 
<A NAME="467"></A>laid down for them. Next, let the wardens of the agora be elected in like 
<A NAME="468"></A>manner, out of the first and second class, five in number: ten are to be 
<A NAME="469"></A>first elected, and out of the ten five are to be chosen by lot, as in the 
<A NAME="470"></A>election of the wardens of the city:-these when they have undergone a scrutiny 
<A NAME="471"></A>are to be declared magistrates. Every one shall vote for every one, and 
<A NAME="472"></A>he who will not vote, if he be informed against before the magistrates, 
<A NAME="473"></A>shall be fined fifty drachmae, and shall also be deemed a bad citizen. 
<A NAME="474"></A>Let any one who likes go to the assembly and to the general council; it 
<A NAME="475"></A>shall be compulsory to go on citizens of the first and second class, and 
<A NAME="476"></A>they shall pay a fine of ten drachmae if they be found not answering to 
<A NAME="477"></A>their names at the assembly. the third and fourth class shall be under 
<A NAME="478"></A>no compulsion, and shall be let off without a fine, unless the magistrates 
<A NAME="479"></A>have commanded all to be present, in consequence of some urgent necessity. 
<A NAME="480"></A>The wardens of the agora shall observe the order appointed by law for the 
<A NAME="481"></A>agora, and shall have the charge of the temples and fountains which are 
<A NAME="482"></A>in the agora; and they shall see that no one injures anything, and punish 
<A NAME="483"></A>him who does, with stripes and bonds, if he be a slave or stranger; but 
<A NAME="484"></A>if he be a citizen who misbehaves in this way, they shall have the power 
<A NAME="485"></A>themselves of inflicting a fine upon him to the amount of a hundred drachmae, 
<A NAME="486"></A>or with the consent of the wardens of the city up to double that amount. 
<A NAME="487"></A>And let the wardens of the city have a similar power of imposing punishments 
<A NAME="488"></A>and fines in their own department; and let them impose fines by their own 
<A NAME="489"></A>department; and let them impose fines by their own authority, up to a mina, 
<A NAME="490"></A>or up to two minae with the consent of the wardens of the 
<A NAME="491"></A>agora.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>In the next place, it will be proper to appoint directors of music 
<A NAME="493"></A>and gymnastic, two kinds of each-of the one kind the business will be education, 
<A NAME="494"></A>of the other, the superintendence of contests. In speaking of education, 
<A NAME="495"></A>the law means to speak of those who have the care of order and instruction 
<A NAME="496"></A>in gymnasia and schools, and of the going to school, and of school buildings 
<A NAME="497"></A>for boys and girls; and in speaking of contests, the law refers to the 
<A NAME="498"></A>judges of gymnastics and of music; these again are divided into two classes, 
<A NAME="499"></A>the one having to do with music, the other with gymnastics; and the same 
<A NAME="500"></A>who judge of the gymnastic contests of men, shall judge of horses; but 
<A NAME="501"></A>in music there shall be one set of judges of solo singing, and of imitation-I 
<A NAME="502"></A>mean of rhapsodists, players on the harp, the flute and the like, and another 
<A NAME="503"></A>who shall judge of choral song. First of all, we must choose directors 
<A NAME="504"></A>for the choruses of boys, and men, and maidens, whom they shall follow 
<A NAME="505"></A>in the amusement of the dance, and for our other musical arrangements; 
<A NAME="506"></A>-one director will be enough for the choruses, and he should be not less 
<A NAME="507"></A>than forty years of age. One director will also be enough to introduce 
<A NAME="508"></A>the solo singers, and to give judgment on the competitors, and he ought 
<A NAME="509"></A>not to be less than thirty years of age. The director and manager of the 
<A NAME="510"></A>choruses shall be elected after the following manner:-Let any persons who 
<A NAME="511"></A>commonly take an interest in such matters go to the meeting, and be fined 
<A NAME="512"></A>if they do not go (the guardians of the law shall judge of their fault), 
<A NAME="513"></A>but those who have no interest shall not be compelled. The elector shall 
<A NAME="514"></A>propose as director some one who understands music, and he in the scrutiny 
<A NAME="515"></A>may be challenged on the one part by those who say he has no skill, and 
<A NAME="516"></A>defended on the other hand by those who say that he has. Ten are to be 
<A NAME="517"></A>elected by vote, and he of the ten who is chosen by lot shall undergo a 
<A NAME="518"></A>scrutiny, and lead the choruses for a year according to law. And in like 
<A NAME="519"></A>manner the competitor who wins the lot shall be leader of the solo and 
<A NAME="520"></A>concert music for that year; and he who is thus elected shall deliver the 
<A NAME="521"></A>award to the judges. In the next place, we have to choose judges in the 
<A NAME="522"></A>contests of horses and of men; these shall be selected from the third and 
<A NAME="523"></A>also from the second class of citizens, and three first classes shall be 
<A NAME="524"></A>compelled to go to the election, but the lowest may stay away with impunity; 
<A NAME="525"></A>and let there be three elected by lot out of the twenty who have been chosen 
<A NAME="526"></A>previously, and they must also have the vote and approval of the examiners. 
<A NAME="527"></A>But if any one is rejected in the scrutiny at any ballot or decision, others 
<A NAME="528"></A>shall be chosen in the same manner, and undergo a similar 
<A NAME="529"></A>scrutiny.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>There remains the minister of the education of youth, male and 
<A NAME="531"></A>female; he too will rule according to law; one such minister will be sufficient, 
<A NAME="532"></A>and he must be fifty years old, and have children lawfully begotten, both 
<A NAME="533"></A>boys and girls by preference, at any rate, one or the other. He who is 
<A NAME="534"></A>elected, and he who is the elector, should consider that of all the great 
<A NAME="535"></A>offices of state, this is the greatest; for the first shoot of any plant, 
<A NAME="536"></A>if it makes a good start towards the attainment of its natural excellence, 
<A NAME="537"></A>has the greatest effect on its maturity; and this is not only true of plants, 
<A NAME="538"></A>but of animals wild and tame, and also of men. Man, as we say, is a tame 
<A NAME="539"></A>or civilized animal; nevertheless, he requires proper instruction and a 
<A NAME="540"></A>fortunate nature, and then of all animals he becomes the most divine and 
<A NAME="541"></A>most civilized; but if he be insufficiently or ill educated he is the most 
<A NAME="542"></A>savage of earthly creatures. Wherefore the legislator ought not to allow 
<A NAME="543"></A>the education of children to become a secondary or accidental matter. In 
<A NAME="544"></A>the first place, he who would be rightly provident about them, should begin 
<A NAME="545"></A>by taking care that he is elected, who of all the citizens is in every 
<A NAME="546"></A>way best; him the legislator shall do his utmost to appoint guardian and 
<A NAME="547"></A>superintendent. To this end all the magistrates, with the exception of 
<A NAME="548"></A>the council and prytanes, shall go to the temple of Apollo, and elect by 
<A NAME="549"></A>ballot him of the guardians of the law whom they severally think will be 
<A NAME="550"></A>the best superintendent of education. And he who has the greatest number 
<A NAME="551"></A>of votes, after he has undergone a scrutiny at the hands of all the magistrates 
<A NAME="552"></A>who have been his electors, with the exception of the guardians of the 
<A NAME="553"></A>law-shall hold office for five years; and in the sixth year let another 
<A NAME="554"></A>be chosen in like manner to fill his office.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR>If any one dies while he is holding a public office, and more than 
<A NAME="556"></A>thirty days before his term of office expires, let those whose business 
<A NAME="557"></A>it is elect another to the office in the same manner as before. And if 
<A NAME="558"></A>any one who is entrusted with orphans dies, let the relations both on the 
<A NAME="559"></A>father's and mother's side, who are residing at home, including cousins, 
<A NAME="560"></A>appoint another guardian within ten days, or be fined a drachma a day for 
<A NAME="561"></A>neglect to do so.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><BR>A city which has no regular courts of law ceases to be a city; 
<A NAME="563"></A>and again, if a judge is silent and says no more in preliminary proceedings 
<A NAME="564"></A>than the litigants, as is the case in arbitrations, he will never be able 
<A NAME="565"></A>to decide justly; wherefore a multitude of judges will not easily judge 
<A NAME="566"></A>well, nor a few if they are bad. The point in dispute between the parties 
<A NAME="567"></A>should be made clear; and time, and deliberation, and repeated examination, 
<A NAME="568"></A>greatly tend to clear up doubts. For this reason, he who goes to law with 
<A NAME="569"></A>another should go first of all to his neighbours and friends who know best 
<A NAME="570"></A>the questions at issue. And if he be unable to obtain from them a satisfactory 
<A NAME="571"></A>decision, let him have recourse to another court; and if the two courts 
<A NAME="572"></A>cannot settle the matter, let a third put an end to the 
<A NAME="573"></A>suit.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>Now the establishment of courts of justice may be regarded as a 
<A NAME="575"></A>choice of magistrates, for every magistrate must also be a judge of some 
<A NAME="576"></A>things; and the judge, though he be not a magistrate, yet in certain respects 
<A NAME="577"></A>is a very important magistrate on the day on which he is determining a 
<A NAME="578"></A>suit. Regarding then the judges also as magistrates, let us say who are 
<A NAME="579"></A>fit to be judges, and of what they are to be judges, and how many of them 
<A NAME="580"></A>are to judge in each suit. Let that be the supreme tribunal which the litigants 
<A NAME="581"></A>appoint in common for themselves, choosing certain persons by agreement. 
<A NAME="582"></A>And let there be two other tribunals: one for private causes, when a citizen 
<A NAME="583"></A>accuses another of wronging him and wishes to get a decision; the other 
<A NAME="584"></A>for public causes, in which some citizen is of opinion that the public 
<A NAME="585"></A>has been wronged by an individual, and is willing to vindicate the common 
<A NAME="586"></A>interests. And we must not forget to mention how the judges are to be qualified, 
<A NAME="587"></A>and who they are to be. In the first place, let there be a tribunal open 
<A NAME="588"></A>to all private persons who are trying causes one against another for the 
<A NAME="589"></A>third time, and let this be composed as follows:-All the officers of state, 
<A NAME="590"></A>as well annual as those holding office for a longer period, when the new 
<A NAME="591"></A>year is about to commence, in the month following after the summer solstice, 
<A NAME="592"></A>on the last day but one of the year, shall meet in some temple, and calling 
<A NAME="593"></A>God to witness, shall dedicate one judge from every magistracy to be their 
<A NAME="594"></A>first-fruits, choosing in each office him who seems to them to be the best, 
<A NAME="595"></A>and whom they deem likely to decide the causes of his fellow-citizens during 
<A NAME="596"></A>the ensuing year in the best and holiest manner. And when the election 
<A NAME="597"></A>is completed, a scrutiny shall be held in the presence of the electors 
<A NAME="598"></A>themselves, and if any one be rejected another shall be chosen in the same 
<A NAME="599"></A>manner. Those who have undergone the scrutiny shall judge the causes of 
<A NAME="600"></A>those who have declined the inferior courts, and shall give their vote 
<A NAME="601"></A>openly. The councillors and other magistrates who have elected them shall 
<A NAME="602"></A>be required to be hearers and spectators of the causes; and any one else 
<A NAME="603"></A>may be present who pleases. If one man charges another with having intentionally 
<A NAME="604"></A>decided wrong, let him go to the guardians of the law and lay his accusation 
<A NAME="605"></A>before them, and he who is found guilty in such a case shall pay damages 
<A NAME="606"></A>to the injured party equal to half the injury; but if he shall appear to 
<A NAME="607"></A>deserve a greater penalty, the judges shall determine what additional punishment 
<A NAME="608"></A>he shall suffer, and how much more he ought to pay to the public treasury, 
<A NAME="609"></A>and to the party who brought the suit.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>In the judgment of offences against the state, the people ought 
<A NAME="611"></A>to participate, for when any one wrongs the state all are wronged, and 
<A NAME="612"></A>may reasonably complain if they are not allowed to share in the decision. 
<A NAME="613"></A>Such causes ought to originate with the people, and the ought also to have 
<A NAME="614"></A>the final decision of them, but the trial of them shall take place before 
<A NAME="615"></A>three of the highest magistrates, upon whom the plaintiff and the defendant 
<A NAME="616"></A>shall agree; and if they are not able to come to an agreement themselves, 
<A NAME="617"></A>the council shall choose one of the two proposed. And in private suits, 
<A NAME="618"></A>too, as far as is possible, all should have a share; for he who has no 
<A NAME="619"></A>share in the administration of justice, is apt to imagine that he has no 
<A NAME="620"></A>share in the state at all. And for this reason there shall be a court of 
<A NAME="621"></A>law in every tribe, and the judges shall be chosen by lot;-they shall give 
<A NAME="622"></A>their decisions at once, and shall be inaccessible to entreaties. The final 
<A NAME="623"></A>judgment shall rest with that court which, as we maintain, has been established 
<A NAME="624"></A>in the most incorruptible form of which human things admit: this shall 
<A NAME="625"></A>be the court established for those who are unable to get rid of their suits 
<A NAME="626"></A>either in the courts of neighbours or of the tribes.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>Thus much of the courts of law, which, as I was saying, cannot 
<A NAME="628"></A>be precisely defined either as being or not being offices; a superficial 
<A NAME="629"></A>sketch has been given of them, in which some things have been told and 
<A NAME="630"></A>others omitted. For the right place of an exact statement of the laws respecting 
<A NAME="631"></A>suits, under their several heads, will be at the end of the body of legislation;-let 
<A NAME="632"></A>us then expect them at the end. Hitherto our legislation has been chiefly 
<A NAME="633"></A>occupied with the appointment of offices. Perfect unity and exactness, 
<A NAME="634"></A>extending to the whole and every particular of political administration, 
<A NAME="635"></A>cannot be attained to the full, until the discussion shall have a beginning, 
<A NAME="636"></A>middle, and end, and is complete in every part. At present we have reached 
<A NAME="637"></A>the election of magistrates, and this may be regarded as a sufficient termination 
<A NAME="638"></A>of what preceded. And now there need no longer be any delay or hesitation 
<A NAME="639"></A>in beginning the work of legislation.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I like what you have said, Stranger-and I particularly 
<A NAME="641"></A>like your manner of tacking on the beginning of your new discourse to the 
<A NAME="642"></A>end of the former one.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Thus far, then, the old men's rational pastime has 
<A NAME="644"></A>gone off well.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> You mean, I suppose, their serious and noble 
<A NAME="646"></A>pursuit?
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Perhaps; but I should like to know whether you and I are 
<A NAME="648"></A>agreed about a certain thing.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> About what thing?
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> You know. the endless labour which painters expend upon 
<A NAME="651"></A>their pictures-they are always putting in or taking out colours, or whatever 
<A NAME="652"></A>be the term which artists employ; they seem as if they would never cease 
<A NAME="653"></A>touching up their works, which are always being made brighter and more 
<A NAME="654"></A>beautiful.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I know something of these matters from report, although 
<A NAME="656"></A>I have never had any great acquaintance with the art.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> No matter; we may make use of the illustration notwithstanding:-Suppose 
<A NAME="658"></A>that some one had a mind to paint a figure in the most beautiful manner, 
<A NAME="659"></A>in the hope that his work instead of losing would always improve as time 
<A NAME="660"></A>went on-do you not see that being a mortal, unless he leaves some one to 
<A NAME="661"></A>succeed him who will correct the flaws which time may introduce, and be 
<A NAME="662"></A>able to add what is left imperfect through the defect of the artist, and 
<A NAME="663"></A>who will further brighten up and improve the picture, all his great labour 
<A NAME="664"></A>will last but a short time?
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And is not the aim of the legislator similar? First, he 
<A NAME="667"></A>desires that his laws should be written down with all possible exactness; 
<A NAME="668"></A>in the second place, as time goes on and he has made an actual trial of 
<A NAME="669"></A>his decrees, will he not find omissions? Do you imagine that there ever 
<A NAME="670"></A>was a legislator so foolish as not to know that many things are necessarily 
<A NAME="671"></A>omitted, which some one coming after him must correct, if the constitution 
<A NAME="672"></A>and the order of government is not to deteriorate, but to improve in the 
<A NAME="673"></A>state which he has established?
<A NAME="674"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Assuredly, that is the sort of thing which every one 
<A NAME="675"></A>would desire.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> And if any one possesses any means of accomplishing 
<A NAME="677"></A>this by word or deed, or has any way great or small by which he can teach 
<A NAME="678"></A>a person to understand how he can maintain and amend the laws, he should 
<A NAME="679"></A>finish what he has to say, and not leave the work incomplete.
<A NAME="680"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And is not this what you and I have to do at the present 
<A NAME="682"></A>moment?
<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What have we to do?
<A NAME="684"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> As we are about to legislate and have chosen our guardians 
<A NAME="685"></A>of the law, and are ourselves in the evening of life, and they as compared 
<A NAME="686"></A>with us are young men, we ought not only to legislate for them, but to 
<A NAME="687"></A>endeavour to make them not only guardians of the law but legislators themselves, 
<A NAME="688"></A>as far as this is possible.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly; if we can.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> At any rate, we must do our best.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> We will say to them-O friends and saviours of our laws, 
<A NAME="693"></A>in laying down any law, there are many particulars which we shall omit, 
<A NAME="694"></A>and this cannot be helped; at the same time, we will do our utmost to describe 
<A NAME="695"></A>what is important, and will give an outline which you shall fill up. And 
<A NAME="696"></A>I will explain on what principle you are to act. Megillus and Cleinias 
<A NAME="697"></A>and I have often spoken to one another touching these matters, and we are 
<A NAME="698"></A>of opinion that we have spoken well. And we hope that you will be of the 
<A NAME="699"></A>same mind with us, and become our disciples, and keep in view the things 
<A NAME="700"></A>which in our united opinion the legislator and guardian of the law ought 
<A NAME="701"></A>to keep in view. There was one main point about which we were agreed-that 
<A NAME="702"></A>a man's whole energies throughout life should be devoted to the acquisition 
<A NAME="703"></A>of the virtue proper to a man, whether this was to be gained by study, 
<A NAME="704"></A>or habit, or some mode of acquisition, or desire, or opinion, or knowledge-and 
<A NAME="705"></A>this applies equally to men and women, old and young-the aim of all should 
<A NAME="706"></A>always be such as I have described; anything which may be an impediment, 
<A NAME="707"></A>the good man ought to show that he utterly disregards. And if at last necessity 
<A NAME="708"></A>plainly compels him to be an outlaw from his native land, rather than bow 
<A NAME="709"></A>his neck to the yoke of slavery and be ruled by inferiors, and he has to 
<A NAME="710"></A>fly, an exile he must be and endure all such trials, rather than accept 
<A NAME="711"></A>another form of government, which is likely to make men worse. These are 
<A NAME="712"></A>our original principles; and do you now, fixing your eyes upon the standard 
<A NAME="713"></A>of what a man and a citizen ought or ought not to be, praise and blame 
<A NAME="714"></A>the laws-blame those which have not this power of making the citizen better, 
<A NAME="715"></A>but embrace those which have; and with gladness receive and live in them; 
<A NAME="716"></A>bidding a long farewell to other institutions which aim at goods, as they 
<A NAME="717"></A>are termed, of a different kind.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR><BR>Let us proceed to another class of laws, beginning with their foundation 
<A NAME="719"></A>in religion. And we must first return to the number 5040-the entire number 
<A NAME="720"></A>had, and has, a great many convenient divisions, and the number of the 
<A NAME="721"></A>tribes which was a twelfth part of the whole, being correctly formed by 
<A NAME="722"></A>21 X 20 [5040/(21 X 20), i.e., 5040/420=12], also has them. And not only 
<A NAME="723"></A>is the whole number divisible by twelve, but also the number of each tribe 
<A NAME="724"></A>is divisible by twelve. Now every portion should be regarded by us as a 
<A NAME="725"></A>sacred gift of Heaven, corresponding to the months and to the revolution 
<A NAME="726"></A>of the universe. Every city has a guiding and sacred principle given by 
<A NAME="727"></A>nature, but in some the division or distribution has been more right than 
<A NAME="728"></A>in others, and has been more sacred and fortunate. In our opinion, nothing 
<A NAME="729"></A>can be more right than the selection of the number 5040, which may be divided 
<A NAME="730"></A>by all numbers from one to twelve with the single exception of eleven, 
<A NAME="731"></A>and that admits of a very easy correction; for if, turning to the dividend 
<A NAME="732"></A>(5040), we deduct two families, the defect in the division is cured. And 
<A NAME="733"></A>the truth of this may be easily proved when we have leisure. But for the 
<A NAME="734"></A>present, trusting to the mere assertion of this principle, let us divide 
<A NAME="735"></A>the state; and assigning to each portion some God or son of a God, let 
<A NAME="736"></A>us give them altars and sacred rites, and at the altars let us hold assemblies 
<A NAME="737"></A>for sacrifice twice in the month-twelve assemblies for the tribes, and 
<A NAME="738"></A>twelve for the city, according to their divisions; the first in honour 
<A NAME="739"></A>of the Gods and divine things, and the second to promote friendship and 
<A NAME="740"></A>"better acquaintance," as the phrase is, and every sort of good fellowship 
<A NAME="741"></A>with one another. For people must be acquainted with those into whose families 
<A NAME="742"></A>and whom they marry and with those to whom they give in marriage; in such 
<A NAME="743"></A>matters, as far as possible, a man should deem it all important to avoid 
<A NAME="744"></A>a mistake, and with this serious purpose let games be instituted in which 
<A NAME="745"></A>youths and maidens shall dance together, seeing one another and being seen 
<A NAME="746"></A>naked, at a proper age, and on a suitable occasion, not transgressing the 
<A NAME="747"></A>rules of modesty.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR><BR>The directors of choruses will be the superintendents and regulators 
<A NAME="749"></A>of these games, and they, together with the guardians of the law, will 
<A NAME="750"></A>legislate in any matters which we have omitted; for, as we said, where 
<A NAME="751"></A>there are numerous and minute details, the legislator must leave out something. 
<A NAME="752"></A>And the annual officers who have experience, and know what is wanted, must 
<A NAME="753"></A>make arrangements and improvements year by year, until such enactments 
<A NAME="754"></A>and provisions are sufficiently determined. A ten years experience of sacrifices 
<A NAME="755"></A>and dances, if extending to all particulars, will be quite sufficient; 
<A NAME="756"></A>and if the legislator be alive they shall communicate with him, but if 
<A NAME="757"></A>he be dead then the several officers shall refer the omissions which come 
<A NAME="758"></A>under their notice to the guardians of the law, and correct them, until 
<A NAME="759"></A>all is perfect; and from that time there shall be no more change, and they 
<A NAME="760"></A>shall establish and use the new laws with the others which the legislator 
<A NAME="761"></A>originally gave them, and of which they are never, if they can help, to 
<A NAME="762"></A>change aught; or, if some necessity overtakes them, the magistrates must 
<A NAME="763"></A>be called into counsel, and the whole people, and they must go to all the 
<A NAME="764"></A>oracles of the Gods; and if they are all agreed, in that case they may 
<A NAME="765"></A>make the change, but if they are not agreed, by no manner of means, and 
<A NAME="766"></A>any one who dissents shall prevail, as the law ordains.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR><BR>Whenever any one over twenty-five years of age, having seen and 
<A NAME="768"></A>been seen by others, believes himself to have found a marriage connection 
<A NAME="769"></A>which is to his mind, and suitable for the procreation of children, let 
<A NAME="770"></A>him marry if he be still under the age of five-and-thirty years; but let 
<A NAME="771"></A>him first hear how he ought to seek after what is suitable and appropriate. 
<A NAME="772"></A>For, as Cleinias says, every law should have a suitable 
<A NAME="773"></A>prelude.
<A NAME="774"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> You recollect at the right moment, Stranger, and do 
<A NAME="775"></A>not miss the opportunity which the argument affords of saying a word in 
<A NAME="776"></A>season.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> I thank you. We will say to him who is born of good 
<A NAME="778"></A>parents-O my son, you ought to make such a marriage as wise men would approve. 
<A NAME="779"></A>Now they would advise you neither to avoid a poor marriage, nor specially 
<A NAME="780"></A>to desire a rich one; but if other things are equal, always to honour inferiors, 
<A NAME="781"></A>and with them to form connections;-this will be for the benefit of the 
<A NAME="782"></A>city and of the families which are united; for the equable and symmetrical 
<A NAME="783"></A>tends infinitely more to virtue than the unmixed. And he who is conscious 
<A NAME="784"></A>of being too headstrong, and carried away more than is fitting in all his 
<A NAME="785"></A>actions, ought to desire to become the relation of orderly parents; and 
<A NAME="786"></A>he who is of the opposite temper ought to seek the opposite alliance. Let 
<A NAME="787"></A>there be one word concerning all marriages:-Every man shall follow, not 
<A NAME="788"></A>after the marriage which is most pleasing to himself, but after that which 
<A NAME="789"></A>is most beneficial to the state. For somehow every one is by nature prone 
<A NAME="790"></A>to that which is likest to himself, and in this way the whole city becomes 
<A NAME="791"></A>unequal in property and in disposition; and hence there arise in most states 
<A NAME="792"></A>the very results which we least desire to happen. Now, to add to the law 
<A NAME="793"></A>an express provision, not only that the rich man shall not marry into the 
<A NAME="794"></A>rich family, nor the powerful into the family of the powerful, but that 
<A NAME="795"></A>the slower natures shall be compelled to enter into marriage with the quicker, 
<A NAME="796"></A>and the quicker with the slower, may awaken anger as well as laughter in 
<A NAME="797"></A>the minds of many; for there is a difficulty in perceiving that the city 
<A NAME="798"></A>ought to be well mingled like a cup, in which the maddening wine is hot 
<A NAME="799"></A>and fiery, but when chastened by a soberer God, receives a fair associate 
<A NAME="800"></A>and becomes an excellent and temperate drink. Yet in marriage no one is 
<A NAME="801"></A>able to see that the same result occurs. Wherefore also the law must let 
<A NAME="802"></A>alone such matters, but we should try to charm the spirits of men into 
<A NAME="803"></A>believing the equability of their children's disposition to be of more 
<A NAME="804"></A>importance than equality in excessive fortune when they marry; and him 
<A NAME="805"></A>who is too desirous of making a rich marriage we should endeavour to turn 
<A NAME="806"></A>aside by reproaches, not, however, by any compulsion of written 
<A NAME="807"></A>law.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR>Let this then be our exhortation concerning marriage, and let us 
<A NAME="809"></A>remember what was said before-that a man should cling to immortality, and 
<A NAME="810"></A>leave behind him children's children to be the servants of God in his place 
<A NAME="811"></A>for ever. All this and much more may be truly said by way of prelude about 
<A NAME="812"></A>the duty of marriage. But if a man will not listen and remains unsocial 
<A NAME="813"></A>and alien among his fellow-citizens, and is still unmarried at thirty-five 
<A NAME="814"></A>years of age, let him pay a yearly fine;-he who of the highest class shall 
<A NAME="815"></A>pay a fine of a hundred drachmae, and he who is of the second dass a fine 
<A NAME="816"></A>of seventy drachmae; the third class shall pay sixty drachmae, and the 
<A NAME="817"></A>fourth thirty drachmae, and let the money be sacred to Here; he who does 
<A NAME="818"></A>not pay the fine annually shall owe ten times the sum, which the treasurer 
<A NAME="819"></A>of the goddess shall exact; and if he fails in doing so, let him be answerable 
<A NAME="820"></A>and give an account of the. money at his audit. He who refuses to marry 
<A NAME="821"></A>shall be thus punished in money, and also be deprived of all honour which 
<A NAME="822"></A>the younger show to the elder; let no young man voluntarily obey him, and 
<A NAME="823"></A>if he attempt to punish any one, let every one come to the rescue and defend 
<A NAME="824"></A>the injured person, and he who is present and does not come to the rescue, 
<A NAME="825"></A>shall be pronounced by the law to be a coward and a bad citizen. Of the 
<A NAME="826"></A>marriage portion I have already spoken; and again I say for the instruction 
<A NAME="827"></A>of poor men that he who neither gives nor receives a dowry on account of 
<A NAME="828"></A>poverty, has a compensation; for the citizens of our state are provided 
<A NAME="829"></A>with the necessaries of life, and wives will be less likely to be insolent, 
<A NAME="830"></A>and husbands to be mean and subservient to them on account of property. 
<A NAME="831"></A>And he who obeys this law will do a noble action; but he who will not obey, 
<A NAME="832"></A>and gives or receives more than fifty drachmae as the price of the marriage 
<A NAME="833"></A>garments if he be of the lowest, or more than a mina, or a mina and-a-half, 
<A NAME="834"></A>if he be of the third or second classes, or two minae if he be of the highest 
<A NAME="835"></A>class, shall owe to the public treasury a similar sum, and that which is 
<A NAME="836"></A>given or received shall be sacred to Here and Zeus; and let the treasurers 
<A NAME="837"></A>of these Gods exact the money, as was said before about the unmarried-that 
<A NAME="838"></A>the treasurers of Here were to exact the money, or pay the fine 
<A NAME="839"></A>themselves.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR>The betrothal by a father shall be valid in the first degree, that 
<A NAME="841"></A>by a grandfather in the second degree, and in the third degree, betrothal 
<A NAME="842"></A>by brothers who have the same father; but if there are none of these alive, 
<A NAME="843"></A>the betrothal by a mother shall be valid in like manner; in cases of unexampled 
<A NAME="844"></A>fatality, the next of kin and the guardians shall have authority. What 
<A NAME="845"></A>are to be the rites before marriages, or any other sacred acts, relating 
<A NAME="846"></A>either to future, present, or past marriages, shall be referred to the 
<A NAME="847"></A>interpreters; and he who follows their advice may be satisfied. Touching 
<A NAME="848"></A>the marriage festival, they shall assemble not more than five male and 
<A NAME="849"></A>five female friends of both families; and a like number of members of the 
<A NAME="850"></A>family of either sex, and no man shall spend more than his means will allow; 
<A NAME="851"></A>he who is of the richest class may spend a mina-he who is of the second, 
<A NAME="852"></A>half a mina, and in the same proportion as the census of each decreases: 
<A NAME="853"></A>all men shall praise him who is obedient to the law; but he who is disobedient 
<A NAME="854"></A>shall be punished by the guardians of the law as a man wanting in true 
<A NAME="855"></A>taste, and uninstructed in the laws of bridal song. Drunkenness is always 
<A NAME="856"></A>improper, except at the festivals of the God who gave wine; and peculiarly 
<A NAME="857"></A>dangerous, when a man is engaged in the business of marriage; at such a 
<A NAME="858"></A>crisis of their lives a bride and bridegroom ought to have all their wits 
<A NAME="859"></A>about them-they ought to take care that their offspring may be born of 
<A NAME="860"></A>reasonable beings; for on what day or night Heaven will give them increase, 
<A NAME="861"></A>who can say? Moreover, they ought not to begetting children when their 
<A NAME="862"></A>bodies are dissipated by intoxication, but their offspring should be compact 
<A NAME="863"></A>and solid, quiet and compounded properly; whereas the drunkard is all abroad 
<A NAME="864"></A>in all his actions, and beside himself both in body and soul. Wherefore, 
<A NAME="865"></A>also, the drunken man is bad and unsteady in sowing the seed of increase, 
<A NAME="866"></A>and is likely to beget offspring who will be unstable and untrustworthy, 
<A NAME="867"></A>and cannot be expected to walk straight either in body or mind. Hence during 
<A NAME="868"></A>the whole year and all his life long, and especially while he is begetting 
<A NAME="869"></A>children, ought to take care and not intentionally do what is injurious 
<A NAME="870"></A>to health, or what involves insolence and wrong; for he cannot help leaving 
<A NAME="871"></A>the impression of himself on the souls and bodies of his offspring, and 
<A NAME="872"></A>he begets children in every way inferior. And especially on the day and 
<A NAME="873"></A>night of marriage should a man abstain from such things. For the beginning, 
<A NAME="874"></A>which is also a God dwelling in man, preserves all things, if it meet with 
<A NAME="875"></A>proper respect from each individual. He who marries is further to consider 
<A NAME="876"></A>that one of the two houses in the lot is the nest and nursery of his young, 
<A NAME="877"></A>and there he is to marry and make a home for himself and bring up his children, 
<A NAME="878"></A>going away from his father and mother. For in friendships there must be 
<A NAME="879"></A>some degree of desire, in order to cement and bind together diversities 
<A NAME="880"></A>of character; but excessive intercourse not having the desire which is 
<A NAME="881"></A>created by time, insensibly dissolves friendships from a feeling of satiety; 
<A NAME="882"></A>wherefore a man and his wife shall leave to his and her father and mother 
<A NAME="883"></A>their own dwelling-places, and themselves go as to a colony and dwell there, 
<A NAME="884"></A>and visit and be visited by their parents; and they shall beget and bring 
<A NAME="885"></A>up children, handing on the torch of life from one generation to another, 
<A NAME="886"></A>and worshipping the Gods according to law for ever.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR><BR>In the next place, we have to consider what sort of property will 
<A NAME="888"></A>be most convenient. There is no difficulty either in understanding or acquiring 
<A NAME="889"></A>most kinds of property, but there is great difficulty in what relates to 
<A NAME="890"></A>slaves. And the reason is that we speak about them in a way which is right 
<A NAME="891"></A>and which is not right; for what we say about our slaves is consistent 
<A NAME="892"></A>and also inconsistent with our practice about them.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR><B>Megillus.</B> I do not understand, Stranger, what you 
<A NAME="894"></A>mean.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I am not surprised, Megillus, for the state of the Helots 
<A NAME="896"></A>among the Lacedaemonians is of all Hellenic forms of slavery the most controverted 
<A NAME="897"></A>and disputed about, some approving and some condemning it; there is less 
<A NAME="898"></A>dispute about the slavery which exists among the Heracleots, who have subjugated 
<A NAME="899"></A>the Mariandynians, and about the Thessalian Penestae. Looking at these 
<A NAME="900"></A>and the like examples, what ought we to do concerning property in slaves? 
<A NAME="901"></A>I made a remark, in passing, which naturally elicited a question about 
<A NAME="902"></A>my meaning from you. It was this:-We know that all would agree that we 
<A NAME="903"></A>should have the best and most attached slaves whom we can get. For many 
<A NAME="904"></A>a man has found his slaves better in every way than brethren or sons, and 
<A NAME="905"></A>many times they have saved the lives and property of their masters and 
<A NAME="906"></A>their whole house-such tales are well known.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But may we not also say that the soul of the slave is utterly 
<A NAME="909"></A>corrupt, and that no man of sense ought to trust them? And the wisest of 
<A NAME="910"></A>our poets, speaking of Zeus, says:
<A NAME="911"></A><BR><BR>Far-seeing Zeus takes away half the understanding of men whom the 
<A NAME="912"></A>day of slavery subdues. Different persons have got these two different 
<A NAME="913"></A>notions of slaves in their minds-some of them utterly distrust their servants, 
<A NAME="914"></A>and, as if they were wild beasts, chastise them with goads and whips, and 
<A NAME="915"></A>make their souls three times, or rather many times, as slavish as they 
<A NAME="916"></A>were before;-and others do just the opposite.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> True.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Then what are we to do in our own country, Stranger, seeing 
<A NAME="919"></A>that there are, such differences in the treatment of slaves by their 
<A NAME="920"></A>owners?
<A NAME="921"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Well, Cleinias, there can be no doubt that man is a 
<A NAME="922"></A>troublesome animal, and therefore he is not very manageable, nor likely 
<A NAME="923"></A>to become so, when you attempt to introduce the necessary division, slave, 
<A NAME="924"></A>and freeman, and master.
<A NAME="925"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That is obvious.
<A NAME="926"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> He is a troublesome piece of goods, as has been often shown 
<A NAME="927"></A>by the frequent revolts of the Messenians, and the great mischiefs which 
<A NAME="928"></A>happen in states having many slaves who speak the same language, and the 
<A NAME="929"></A>numerous robberies and lawless life of the Italian banditti, as they are 
<A NAME="930"></A>called. A man who considers all this is fairly at a loss. Two remedies 
<A NAME="931"></A>alone remain to us-not to have the slaves of the same country, nor if possible, 
<A NAME="932"></A>speaking the same language; in this way they will more easily be held in 
<A NAME="933"></A>subjection: secondly, we should tend them carefully, not only out of regard 
<A NAME="934"></A>to them, but yet more out of respect to ourselves. And the right treatment 
<A NAME="935"></A>of slaves is to behave properly to them, and to do to them, if possible, 
<A NAME="936"></A>even more justice than to those who are our equals; for he who naturally 
<A NAME="937"></A>and genuinely reverences justice, and hates injustice, is discovered in 
<A NAME="938"></A>his dealings with any class of men to whom he can easily be unjust. And 
<A NAME="939"></A>he who in regard to the natures and actions of his slaves is undefiled 
<A NAME="940"></A>by impiety and injustice, will best sow the seeds of virtue in them; and 
<A NAME="941"></A>this may be truly said of every master, and tyrant, and of every other 
<A NAME="942"></A>having authority in relation to his inferiors. Slaves ought to be punished 
<A NAME="943"></A>as they deserve, and not admonished as if they were freemen, which will 
<A NAME="944"></A>only make them conceited. The language used to a servant ought always to 
<A NAME="945"></A>be that of a command, and we ought not to jest with them, whether they 
<A NAME="946"></A>are males or females-this is a foolish way which many people have of setting 
<A NAME="947"></A>up their slaves, and making the life of servitude more disagreeable both 
<A NAME="948"></A>for them and for their masters.
<A NAME="949"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Now that each of the citizens is provided, as far as possible, 
<A NAME="951"></A>with a sufficient number of suitable slaves who can help him in what he 
<A NAME="952"></A>has to do, we may next proceed to describe their dwellings.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The city being new and hitherto uninhabited, care ought 
<A NAME="955"></A>to be taken of all the buildings, and the manner of building each of them, 
<A NAME="956"></A>and also of the temples and walls. These, Cleinias, were matters which 
<A NAME="957"></A>properly came before the marriages; but, as we are only talking, there 
<A NAME="958"></A>is no objection to changing the order. If, however, our plan of legislation 
<A NAME="959"></A>is ever to take effect, then the house shall precede the marriage if God 
<A NAME="960"></A>so will, and afterwards we will come to the regulations about marriage; 
<A NAME="961"></A>but at present we are only describing these matters in a general 
<A NAME="962"></A>outline.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="964"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The temples are to be placed all round the agora, and the 
<A NAME="965"></A>whole city built on the heights in a circle, for the sake of defence and 
<A NAME="966"></A>for the sake of purity. Near the temples are to be placed buildings for 
<A NAME="967"></A>the magistrates and the courts of law; in these plaintiff and defendant 
<A NAME="968"></A>will receive their due, and the places will be regarded as most holy, partly 
<A NAME="969"></A>because they have to do with the holy things: and partly because they are 
<A NAME="970"></A>the dwelling-places of holy Gods: and in them will be held the courts in 
<A NAME="971"></A>which cases of homicide and other trials of capital offenses may fitly 
<A NAME="972"></A>take place. As to the walls, Megillus, I agree with Sparta in thinking 
<A NAME="973"></A>that they should be allowed to sleep in the earth, and that we should not 
<A NAME="974"></A>attempt to disinter them; there is a poetical saying, which is finely expressed, 
<A NAME="975"></A>that "walls ought to be of steel and iron, and not of earth; besides, how 
<A NAME="976"></A>ridiculous of us to be sending out our young men annually into the country 
<A NAME="977"></A>to dig and to trench, and to keep off the enemy by fortifications, under 
<A NAME="978"></A>the idea that they are not to be allowed to set foot in our territory, 
<A NAME="979"></A>and then, that we should surround ourselves with a wall, which, in the 
<A NAME="980"></A>first place, is by no means conducive to the health of cities, and is also 
<A NAME="981"></A>apt to produce a certain effeminacy in the minds of the inhabitants, inviting 
<A NAME="982"></A>men to run thither instead of repelling their enemies, and leading them 
<A NAME="983"></A>to imagine that their safety is due not to their keeping guard day and 
<A NAME="984"></A>night, but that when they are protected by walls and gates, then they may 
<A NAME="985"></A>sleep in safety; as if they were not meant to labour, and did not know 
<A NAME="986"></A>that true repose comes from labour, and that disgraceful indolence and 
<A NAME="987"></A>a careless temper of mind is only the renewal of trouble. But if men must 
<A NAME="988"></A>have walls, the private houses ought to be so arranged from the first that 
<A NAME="989"></A>the whole city may be one wall, having all the houses capable of defence 
<A NAME="990"></A>by reason of their uniformity and equality towards the streets. The form 
<A NAME="991"></A>of the city being that of a single dwelling will have an agreeable aspect, 
<A NAME="992"></A>and being easily guarded will be infinitely better for security. Until 
<A NAME="993"></A>the original building is completed, these should be the principal objects 
<A NAME="994"></A>of the inhabitants; and the wardens of the city should superintend the 
<A NAME="995"></A>work, and should impose a fine on him who is negligent; and in all that 
<A NAME="996"></A>relates to the city they should have a care of cleanliness, and not allow 
<A NAME="997"></A>a private person to encroach upon any public property either by buildings 
<A NAME="998"></A>or excavations. Further, they ought to take care that the rains from heaven 
<A NAME="999"></A>flow off easily, and of any other matters which may have to be administered 
<A NAME="1000"></A>either within or without the city. The guardians of the law shall pass 
<A NAME="1001"></A>any further enactments which their experience may show to be necessary, 
<A NAME="1002"></A>and supply any other points in which the law may be deficient. And now 
<A NAME="1003"></A>that these matters, and the buildings about the agora, and the gymnasia, 
<A NAME="1004"></A>and places of instruction, and theatres, are all ready and waiting for 
<A NAME="1005"></A>scholars and spectators, let us proceed to the subjects which follow marriage 
<A NAME="1006"></A>in the order of legislation.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Assuming that marriages exist already, Cleinias, the mode 
<A NAME="1009"></A>of life during the year after marriage, before children are born, will 
<A NAME="1010"></A>follow next in order. In what way bride and bridegroom ought to live in 
<A NAME="1011"></A>a city which is to be superior to other cities, is a matter not at all 
<A NAME="1012"></A>easy for us to determine. There have been many difficulties already, but 
<A NAME="1013"></A>this will be the greatest of them, and the most disagreeable to the many. 
<A NAME="1014"></A>Still I cannot but say what appears to me to be right and true, 
<A NAME="1015"></A>Cleinias.
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> He who imagines that he can give laws for the public conduct 
<A NAME="1018"></A>of states, while he leaves the private life of citizens wholly to take 
<A NAME="1019"></A>care of itself; who thinks that individuals may pass the day as they please, 
<A NAME="1020"></A>and that there is no necessity of order in all things; he, I say, who gives 
<A NAME="1021"></A>up the control of their private lives, and supposes that they will conform 
<A NAME="1022"></A>to law in their common and public life, is making a great mistake. Why 
<A NAME="1023"></A>have I made this remark? Why, because I am going to enact that the bridegrooms 
<A NAME="1024"></A>should live at the common tables, just as they did before marriage. This 
<A NAME="1025"></A>was a singularity when first enacted by the legislator in your parts of 
<A NAME="1026"></A>the world, Megillus and Cleinias, as I should suppose, on the occasion 
<A NAME="1027"></A>of some war or other similar danger, which caused the passing of the law, 
<A NAME="1028"></A>and which would be likely to occur in thinly-peopled places, and in times 
<A NAME="1029"></A>of pressure. But when men had once tried and been accustomed to a common 
<A NAME="1030"></A>table, experience showed that the institution greatly conduced to security; 
<A NAME="1031"></A>and in some such manner the custom of having common tables arose among 
<A NAME="1032"></A>you.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Likely enough.
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I said that there may have been singularity and danger 
<A NAME="1035"></A>in imposing such a custom at first, but that now there is not the same 
<A NAME="1036"></A>difficulty. There is, however, another institution which is the natural 
<A NAME="1037"></A>sequel to this, and would be excellent, if it existed anywhere, but at 
<A NAME="1038"></A>present it does not. The institution of which I am about to speak is not 
<A NAME="1039"></A>easily described or executed; and would be like the legislator "combing 
<A NAME="1040"></A>wool into the fire," as people say, or performing any other impossible 
<A NAME="1041"></A>and useless feat.
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What is the cause, Stranger, of this extreme 
<A NAME="1043"></A>hesitation?
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> You shall hear without any fruitless loss of time. That 
<A NAME="1045"></A>which has law and order in a state is the cause of every good, but that 
<A NAME="1046"></A>which is disordered or ill-ordered is often the ruin of that which is well-ordered; 
<A NAME="1047"></A>and at this point the argument is now waiting. For with you, Cleinias and 
<A NAME="1048"></A>Megillus, the common tables of men are, as I said, a heaven-born and admirable 
<A NAME="1049"></A>institution, but you are mistaken in leaving the women unregulated by law. 
<A NAME="1050"></A>They have no similar institution of public tables in the light of day, 
<A NAME="1051"></A>and just that part of the human race which is by nature prone to secrecy 
<A NAME="1052"></A>and stealth on account of their weakness-I mean the female sex-has been 
<A NAME="1053"></A>left without regulation by the legislator, which is a great mistake. And, 
<A NAME="1054"></A>in consequence of this neglect, many things have grown lax among you, which 
<A NAME="1055"></A>might have been far better, if they had been only regulated by law; for 
<A NAME="1056"></A>the neglect of regulations about women may not only be regarded as a neglect 
<A NAME="1057"></A>of half the entire matter, but in proportion as woman's nature is inferior 
<A NAME="1058"></A>to that of men in capacity for virtue, in that degree the consequence of 
<A NAME="1059"></A>such neglect is more than twice as important. The careful consideration 
<A NAME="1060"></A>of this matter, and the arranging and ordering on a common principle of 
<A NAME="1061"></A>all our institutions relating both to men and women, greatly conduces to 
<A NAME="1062"></A>the happiness of the state. But at present, such is the unfortunate condition 
<A NAME="1063"></A>of mankind, that no man of sense will even venture to speak of common tables 
<A NAME="1064"></A>in places and cities in which they have never been established at all; 
<A NAME="1065"></A>and how can any one avoid being utterly ridiculous, who attempts to compel 
<A NAME="1066"></A>women to show in public how much they eat and drink? There is nothing at 
<A NAME="1067"></A>which the sex is more likely to take offence. For women are accustomed 
<A NAME="1068"></A>to creep into dark places, and when dragged out into the light they will 
<A NAME="1069"></A>exert their utmost powers of resistance, and be far too much for the legislator. 
<A NAME="1070"></A>And therefore, as I said before, in most places they will not endure to 
<A NAME="1071"></A>have the truth spoken without raising a tremendous outcry, but in this 
<A NAME="1072"></A>state perhaps they may. And if we may assume that our whole discussion 
<A NAME="1073"></A>about the state has not been mere idle talk, I should like to prove to 
<A NAME="1074"></A>you, if you will consent to listen, that this institution is good and proper; 
<A NAME="1075"></A>but if you had rather not, I will refrain.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> There is nothing which we should both of us like better, 
<A NAME="1077"></A>Stranger, than to hear what you have to say.
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Very good; and you must not be surprised if I go back 
<A NAME="1079"></A>a little, for we have plenty of leisure, and there is nothing to prevent 
<A NAME="1080"></A>us from considering in every point of view the subject of 
<A NAME="1081"></A>law.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then let us return once more to what we were saying at 
<A NAME="1084"></A>first. Every man should understand that the human race either had no beginning 
<A NAME="1085"></A>at all, and will never have an end, but always will be and has been; or 
<A NAME="1086"></A>that it began an immense while ago.
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Well, and have there not been constitutions and destructions 
<A NAME="1089"></A>of states, and all sorts of pursuits both orderly and disorderly, and diverse 
<A NAME="1090"></A>desires of meats and drinks always, and in all the world, and all sorts 
<A NAME="1091"></A>of changes of the seasons in which animals may be expected to have undergone 
<A NAME="1092"></A>innumerable transformations of themselves?
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> No doubt.
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And may we not suppose that vines appeared, which had previously 
<A NAME="1095"></A>no existence, and also olives, and the gifts of Demeter and her daughter, 
<A NAME="1096"></A>of which one Triptolemus was the minister, and that, before these existed, 
<A NAME="1097"></A>animals took to devouring each other as they do still?
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
