<A NAME="10"></A>Persons f THE DIALOGUE: An ATHENIAN STRANGER; CLEINIAS, a Cretan; MEGILLUS, 
<A NAME="11"></A>a Lacedaemonian
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>Athenian Stranger. Tell me, Strangers, is a God or some man supposed 
<A NAME="13"></A>to be the author of your laws?
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR><B>Cleinias.</B> A God, Stranger; in very truth a, God: among us 
<A NAME="15"></A>Cretans he is said to have been Zeus, but in Lacedaemon, whence our friend 
<A NAME="16"></A>here comes, I believe they would say that Apollo is their lawgiver: would 
<A NAME="17"></A>they not, Megillus?
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR><B>Megillus.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And do you, Cleinias, believe, as Homer tells, that every 
<A NAME="20"></A>ninth year Minos went to converse with his Olympian sire, and was inspired 
<A NAME="21"></A>by him to make laws for your cities?
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes, that is our tradition; and there was Rhadamanthus, 
<A NAME="23"></A>a brother of his, with whose name you are familiar; he is reputed to have 
<A NAME="24"></A>been the justest of men, and we Cretans are of opinion that he earned this 
<A NAME="25"></A>reputation from his righteous administration of justice when he was 
<A NAME="26"></A>alive.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes, and a noble reputation it was, worthy of a son 
<A NAME="28"></A>of Zeus. As you and Megillus have been trained in these institutions, I 
<A NAME="29"></A>dare say that you will not be unwilling to give an account of your government 
<A NAME="30"></A>and laws; on our way we can pass the time pleasantly in about them, for 
<A NAME="31"></A>I am told that the distance from Cnosus to the cave and temple of Zeus 
<A NAME="32"></A>is considerable; and doubtless there are shady places under the lofty trees, 
<A NAME="33"></A>which will protect us from this scorching sun. Being no longer young, we 
<A NAME="34"></A>may often stop to rest beneath them, and get over the whole journey without 
<A NAME="35"></A>difficulty, beguiling the time by conversation.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes, Stranger, and if we proceed onward we shall come 
<A NAME="37"></A>to groves of cypresses, which are of rare height and beauty, and there 
<A NAME="38"></A>are green meadows, in which we may repose and converse.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very good, indeed; and still better when we see them; let 
<A NAME="41"></A>us move on cheerily.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> I am willing-And first, I want to know why the law 
<A NAME="43"></A>has ordained that you shall have common meals and gymnastic exercises, 
<A NAME="44"></A>and wear arms.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I think, Stranger, that the aim of our institutions 
<A NAME="46"></A>is easily intelligible to any one. Look at the character of our country: 
<A NAME="47"></A>Crete is not like Thessaly, a large plain; and for this reason they have 
<A NAME="48"></A>horsemen in Thessaly, and we have runners-the inequality of the ground 
<A NAME="49"></A>in our country is more adapted to locomotion on foot; but then, if you 
<A NAME="50"></A>have runners you must have light arms-no one can carry a heavy weight when 
<A NAME="51"></A>running, and bows and arrows are convenient because they are light. Now 
<A NAME="52"></A>all these regulations have been made with a view to war, and the legislator 
<A NAME="53"></A>appears to me to have looked to this in all his arrangements:-the common 
<A NAME="54"></A>meals, if I am not mistaken, were instituted by him for a similar reason, 
<A NAME="55"></A>because he saw that while they are in the field the citizens are by the 
<A NAME="56"></A>nature of the case compelled to take their meals together for the sake 
<A NAME="57"></A>of mutual protection. He seems to me to have thought the world foolish 
<A NAME="58"></A>in not understanding that all are always at war with one another; and if 
<A NAME="59"></A>in war there ought to be common meals and certain persons regularly appointed 
<A NAME="60"></A>under others to protect an army, they should be continued in peace. For 
<A NAME="61"></A>what men in general term peace would be said by him to be only a name; 
<A NAME="62"></A>in reality every city is in a natural state of war with every other, not 
<A NAME="63"></A>indeed proclaimed by heralds, but everlasting. And if you look closely, 
<A NAME="64"></A>you will find that this was the intention of the Cretan legislator; all 
<A NAME="65"></A>institutions, private as well as public, were arranged by him with a view 
<A NAME="66"></A>to war; in giving them he was under the impression that no possessions 
<A NAME="67"></A>or institutions are of any value to him who is defeated in battle; for 
<A NAME="68"></A>all the good things of the conquered pass into the hands of the 
<A NAME="69"></A>conquerors.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> You appear to me, Stranger, to have been thoroughly 
<A NAME="71"></A>trained in the Cretan institutions, and to be well informed about them; 
<A NAME="72"></A>will you tell me a little more explicitly what is the principle of government 
<A NAME="73"></A>which you would lay down? You seem to imagine that a well governed state 
<A NAME="74"></A>ought to be so ordered as to conquer all other states in war: am I right 
<A NAME="75"></A>in supposing this to be your meaning?
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly; and our Lacedaemonian friend, if I am not 
<A NAME="77"></A>mistaken, will agree with me.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Why, my good friend, how could any Lacedaemonian say 
<A NAME="79"></A>anything else?
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> And is what you say applicable only to states, or also 
<A NAME="81"></A>to villages?
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To both alike.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The case is the same?
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And in the village will there be the same war of family 
<A NAME="86"></A>against family, and of individual against individual?
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> The same.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And should each man conceive himself to be his own enemy:-what 
<A NAME="89"></A>shall we say?
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> O Athenian Stranger-inhabitant of Attica I will not 
<A NAME="91"></A>call you, for you seem to deserve rather to be named after the goddess 
<A NAME="92"></A>herself, because you go back to first principles you have thrown a light 
<A NAME="93"></A>upon the argument, and will now be better able to understand what I was 
<A NAME="94"></A>just saying-that all men are publicly one another's enemies, and each man 
<A NAME="95"></A>privately his own.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>(Ath. My good sir, what do you mean?)--
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Cle..... Moreover, there is a victory and defeat-the first and best 
<A NAME="98"></A>of victories, the lowest and worst of defeats-which each man gains or sustains 
<A NAME="99"></A>at the hands, not of another, but of himself; this shows that there is 
<A NAME="100"></A>a war against ourselves going on within every one of 
<A NAME="101"></A>us.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us now reverse the order of the argument: Seeing 
<A NAME="103"></A>that every individual is either his own superior or his own inferior, may 
<A NAME="104"></A>we say that there is the same principle in the house, the village, and 
<A NAME="105"></A>the state?
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> You mean that in each of them there is a principle 
<A NAME="107"></A>of superiority or inferiority to self?
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> You are quite right in asking the question, for there certainly 
<A NAME="110"></A>is such a principle, and above all in states; and the state in which the 
<A NAME="111"></A>better citizens win a victory over the mob and over the inferior classes 
<A NAME="112"></A>may be truly said to be better than itself, and may be justly praised, 
<A NAME="113"></A>where such a victory is gained, or censured in the opposite 
<A NAME="114"></A>case.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Whether the better is ever really conquered by the 
<A NAME="116"></A>worse, is a question which requires more discussion, and may be therefore 
<A NAME="117"></A>left for the present. But I now quite understand your meaning when you 
<A NAME="118"></A>say that citizens who are of the same race and live in the same cities 
<A NAME="119"></A>may unjustly conspire, and having the superiority in numbers may overcome 
<A NAME="120"></A>and enslave the few just; and when they prevail, the state may be truly 
<A NAME="121"></A>called its own inferior and therefore bad; and when they are defeated, 
<A NAME="122"></A>its own superior and therefore good.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Your remark, Stranger, is a paradox, and yet we cannot 
<A NAME="124"></A>possibly deny it.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Here is another case for consideration;-in a family 
<A NAME="126"></A>there may be several brothers, who are the offspring of a single pair; 
<A NAME="127"></A>very possibly the majority of them may be unjust, and the just may be in 
<A NAME="128"></A>a minority.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very possibly.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And you and I ought not to raise a question of words as 
<A NAME="131"></A>to whether this family and household are rightly said to be superior when 
<A NAME="132"></A>they conquer, and inferior when they are conquered; for we are not now 
<A NAME="133"></A>considering what may or may not be the proper or customary way of speaking, 
<A NAME="134"></A>but we are considering the natural principles of right and wrong in 
<A NAME="135"></A>laws.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What you say, Stranger, is most 
<A NAME="137"></A>true.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><B>Meg.</B> Quite excellent, in my opinion, as far as we have 
<A NAME="139"></A>gone.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Again; might there not be a judge over these brethren, 
<A NAME="141"></A>of whom we were speaking?
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Now, which would be the better judge-one who destroyed 
<A NAME="144"></A>the bad and appointed the good to govern themselves; or one who, while 
<A NAME="145"></A>allowing the good to govern, let the bad live, and made them voluntarily 
<A NAME="146"></A>submit? Or third, I suppose, in the scale of excellence might be placed 
<A NAME="147"></A>a judge, who, finding the family distracted, not only did not destroy any 
<A NAME="148"></A>one, but reconciled them to one another for ever after, and gave them laws 
<A NAME="149"></A>which they mutually observed, and was able to keep them 
<A NAME="150"></A>friends.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> The last would be by far the best sort of judge and 
<A NAME="152"></A>legislator.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And yet the aim of all the laws which he gave would be 
<A NAME="154"></A>the reverse of war.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And will he who constitutes the state and orders the life 
<A NAME="157"></A>of man have in view external war, or that kind of intestine war called 
<A NAME="158"></A>civil, which no one, if he could prevent, would like to have occurring 
<A NAME="159"></A>in his own state; and when occurring, every one would wish to be quit of 
<A NAME="160"></A>as soon as possible?
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> He would have the latter chiefly in 
<A NAME="162"></A>view.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And would he prefer that this civil war should be terminated 
<A NAME="164"></A>by the destruction of one of the parties, and by the victory of the other, 
<A NAME="165"></A>or that peace and friendship should be re-established, and that, being 
<A NAME="166"></A>reconciled, they should give their attention to foreign 
<A NAME="167"></A>enemies?
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Every one would desire the latter in the case of his 
<A NAME="169"></A>own state.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And would not that also be the desire of the 
<A NAME="171"></A>legislator?
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And would not every one always make laws for the sake of 
<A NAME="174"></A>the best?
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But war, whether external or civil, is not the best, and 
<A NAME="177"></A>the need of either is to be deprecated; but peace with one another, and 
<A NAME="178"></A>good will, are best. Nor is the victory of the state over itself to be 
<A NAME="179"></A>regarded as a really good thing, but as a necessity; a man might as well 
<A NAME="180"></A>say that the body was in the best state when sick and purged by medicine, 
<A NAME="181"></A>forgetting that there is also a state of the body which needs no purge. 
<A NAME="182"></A>And in like manner no one can be a true statesman, whether he aims at the 
<A NAME="183"></A>happiness of the individual or state, who looks only, or first of all, 
<A NAME="184"></A>to external warfare; nor will he ever be a sound legislator who orders 
<A NAME="185"></A>peace for the sake of war, and not war for the sake of 
<A NAME="186"></A>peace.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I suppose that there is truth, Stranger, in that remark 
<A NAME="188"></A>of yours; and yet I am greatly mistaken if war is not the entire aim and 
<A NAME="189"></A>object of our own institutions, and also of the Lacedaemonian.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> I dare say; but there is no reason why we should rudely 
<A NAME="191"></A>quarrel with one another about your legislators, instead of gently questioning 
<A NAME="192"></A>them, seeing that both we and they are equally in earnest. Please follow 
<A NAME="193"></A>me and the argument closely:-And first I will put forward Tyrtaeus, an 
<A NAME="194"></A>Athenian by birth, but also a Spartan citizen, who of all men was most 
<A NAME="195"></A>eager about war: Well, he says, "I sing not, I care not, about any man, 
<A NAME="196"></A>even if he were the richest of men, and possessed every good (and then 
<A NAME="197"></A>he gives a whole list of them), if he be not at all times a brave warrior." 
<A NAME="198"></A>I imagine that you, too, must have heard his poems; our Lacedaemonian friend 
<A NAME="199"></A>has probably heard more than enough of them.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> And they have found their way from Lacedaemon to 
<A NAME="202"></A>Crete.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Come now and let us all join in asking this question of 
<A NAME="204"></A>Tyrtaeus: O most divine poet, we will say to him, the excellent praise 
<A NAME="205"></A>which you have bestowed on those who excel in war sufficiently proves that 
<A NAME="206"></A>you are wise and good, and I and Megillus and Cleinias of Cnosus do, as 
<A NAME="207"></A>I believe, entirely agree with you. But we should like to be quite sure 
<A NAME="208"></A>that we are speaking of the same men; tell us, then, do you agree with 
<A NAME="209"></A>us in thinking that there are two kinds of war; or what would you say? 
<A NAME="210"></A>A far inferior man to Tyrtaeus would have no difficulty in replying quite 
<A NAME="211"></A>truly, that war is of two kinds one which is universally called civil war, 
<A NAME="212"></A>and is as we were just now saying, of all wars the worst; the other, as 
<A NAME="213"></A>we should all admit, in which we fall out with other nations who are of 
<A NAME="214"></A>a different race, is a far milder form of warfare.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly, far milder.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Well, now, when you praise and blame war in this high-flown 
<A NAME="217"></A>strain, whom are you praising or blaming, and to which kind of war are 
<A NAME="218"></A>you referring? I suppose that you must mean foreign war, if I am to judge 
<A NAME="219"></A>from expressions of yours in which you say that you abominate 
<A NAME="220"></A>those
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>Who refuse to look upon fields of blood, and will not draw near 
<A NAME="222"></A>and strike at their enemies. And we shall naturally go on to say to him-You, 
<A NAME="223"></A>Tyrtaeus, as it seems, praise those who distinguish themselves in external 
<A NAME="224"></A>and foreign war; and he must admit this.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Evidently.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> They are good; but we say that there are still better men 
<A NAME="227"></A>whose virtue is displayed in the greatest of all battles. And we too have 
<A NAME="228"></A>a poet whom we summon as a witness, Theognis, citizen of Megara in 
<A NAME="229"></A>Sicily:
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>Cyrnus, he who is faithful in a civil broil is worth his weight 
<A NAME="231"></A>in gold and silver. And such an one is far better, as we affirm, than the 
<A NAME="232"></A>other in a more difficult kind of war, much in the same degree as justice 
<A NAME="233"></A>and temperance and wisdom, when united with courage, are better than courage 
<A NAME="234"></A>only; for a man cannot be faithful and good in civil strife without having 
<A NAME="235"></A>all virtue. But in the war of which Tyrtaeus speaks, many a mercenary soldier 
<A NAME="236"></A>will take his stand and be ready to die at his post, and yet they are generally 
<A NAME="237"></A>and almost without exception insolent, unjust, violent men, and the most 
<A NAME="238"></A>senseless of human beings. You will ask what the conclusion is, and what 
<A NAME="239"></A>I am seeking to prove: I maintain that the divine legislator of Crete, 
<A NAME="240"></A>like any other who is worthy of consideration, will always and above all 
<A NAME="241"></A>things in making laws have regard to the greatest virtue; which, according 
<A NAME="242"></A>to Theognis, is loyalty in the hour of danger, and may be truly called 
<A NAME="243"></A>perfect justice. Whereas, that virtue which Tyrtaeus highly praises is 
<A NAME="244"></A>well enough, and was praised by the poet at the right time, yet in place 
<A NAME="245"></A>and dignity may be said to be only fourth rate.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Stranger, we are degrading our inspired lawgiver to 
<A NAME="247"></A>a rank which is far beneath him.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Nay, I think that we degrade not him but ourselves, 
<A NAME="249"></A>if we imagine that Lycurgus and Minos laid down laws both in Lacedaemon 
<A NAME="250"></A>and Crete mainly with a view to war.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What ought we to say then?
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> What truth and what justice require of us, if I am not 
<A NAME="253"></A>mistaken, when speaking in behalf of divine excellence;-at the legislator 
<A NAME="254"></A>when making his laws had in view not a part only, and this the lowest part 
<A NAME="255"></A>of virtue, but all virtue, and that he devised classes of laws answering 
<A NAME="256"></A>to the kinds of virtue; not in the way in which modern inventors of laws 
<A NAME="257"></A>make the classes, for they only investigate and offer laws whenever a want 
<A NAME="258"></A>is felt, and one man has a class of laws about allotments and heiresses, 
<A NAME="259"></A>another about assaults; others about ten thousand other such matters. But 
<A NAME="260"></A>we maintain that the right way of examining into laws is to proceed as 
<A NAME="261"></A>we have now done, and I admired the spirit of your exposition; for you 
<A NAME="262"></A>were quite right in beginning with virtue, and saying that this was the 
<A NAME="263"></A>aim of the giver of the law, but I thought that you went wrong when you 
<A NAME="264"></A>added that all his legislation had a view only to a part, and the least 
<A NAME="265"></A>part of virtue, and this called forth my subsequent remarks. Will you allow 
<A NAME="266"></A>me then to explain how I should have liked to have heard you expound the 
<A NAME="267"></A>matter?
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> You ought to have said, Stranger-The Cretan laws are with 
<A NAME="270"></A>reason famous among the Hellenes; for they fulfil the object of laws, which 
<A NAME="271"></A>is to make those who use them happy; and they confer every sort of good. 
<A NAME="272"></A>Now goods are of two kinds: there are human and there are divine goods, 
<A NAME="273"></A>and the human hang upon the divine; and the state which attains the greater, 
<A NAME="274"></A>at the same time acquires the less, or, not having the greater, has neither. 
<A NAME="275"></A>Of the lesser goods the first is health, the second beauty, the third strength, 
<A NAME="276"></A>including swiftness in running and bodily agility generally, and the fourth 
<A NAME="277"></A>is wealth, not the blind god [Pluto], but one who is keen of sight, if 
<A NAME="278"></A>only he has wisdom for his companion. For wisdom is chief and leader of 
<A NAME="279"></A>the divine dass of goods, and next follows temperance; and from the union 
<A NAME="280"></A>of these two with courage springs justice, and fourth in the scale of virtue 
<A NAME="281"></A>is courage. All these naturally take precedence of the other goods, and 
<A NAME="282"></A>this is the order in which the legislator must place them, and after them 
<A NAME="283"></A>he will enjoin the rest of his ordinances on the citizens with a view to 
<A NAME="284"></A>these, the human looking to the divine, and the divine looking to their 
<A NAME="285"></A>leader mind. Some of his ordinances will relate to contracts of marriage 
<A NAME="286"></A>which they make one with another, and then to the procreation and education 
<A NAME="287"></A>of children, both male and female; the duty of the lawgiver will be to 
<A NAME="288"></A>take charge of his citizens, in youth and age, and at every time of life, 
<A NAME="289"></A>and to give them punishments and rewards; and in reference to all their 
<A NAME="290"></A>intercourse with one another, he ought to consider their pains and pleasures 
<A NAME="291"></A>and desires, and the vehemence of all their passions; he should keep a 
<A NAME="292"></A>watch over them, and blame and praise them rightly by the mouth of the 
<A NAME="293"></A>laws themselves. Also with regard to anger and terror, and the other perturbations 
<A NAME="294"></A>of the soul, which arise out of misfortune, and the deliverances from them 
<A NAME="295"></A>which prosperity brings, and the experiences which come to men in diseases, 
<A NAME="296"></A>or in war, or poverty, or the opposite of these; in all these states he 
<A NAME="297"></A>should determine and teach what is the good and evil of the condition of 
<A NAME="298"></A>each. In the next place, the legislator has to be careful how the citizens 
<A NAME="299"></A>make their money and in what way they spend it, and to have an eye to their 
<A NAME="300"></A>mutual contracts and dissolutions of contracts, whether voluntary or involuntary: 
<A NAME="301"></A>he should see how they order all this, and consider where justice as well 
<A NAME="302"></A>as injustice is found or is wanting in their several dealings with one 
<A NAME="303"></A>another; and honour those who obey the law, and impose fixed penalties 
<A NAME="304"></A>on those who disobey, until the round of civil life is ended, and the time 
<A NAME="305"></A>has come for the consideration of the proper funeral rites and honours 
<A NAME="306"></A>of the dead. And the lawgiver reviewing his work, will appoint guardians 
<A NAME="307"></A>to preside over these things-some who walk by intelligence, others by true 
<A NAME="308"></A>opinion only, and then mind will bind together all his ordinances and show 
<A NAME="309"></A>them to be in harmony with temperance and justice, and not with wealth 
<A NAME="310"></A>or ambition. This is the spirit, Stranger, in which I was and am desirous 
<A NAME="311"></A>that you should pursue the subject. And I want to know the nature of all 
<A NAME="312"></A>these things, and how they are arranged in the laws of Zeus, as they are 
<A NAME="313"></A>termed, and in those of the Pythian Apollo, which Minos and Lycurgus gave; 
<A NAME="314"></A>and how the order of them is discovered to his eyes, who has experience 
<A NAME="315"></A>in laws gained either by study or habit, although they are far from being 
<A NAME="316"></A>self-evident to the rest of mankind like ourselves.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How shall we proceed, Stranger?
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I think that we must begin again as before, and first consider 
<A NAME="319"></A>the habit of courage; and then we will go on and discuss another and then 
<A NAME="320"></A>another form of virtue, if you please. In this way we shall have a model 
<A NAME="321"></A>of the whole; and with these and similar discourses we will beguile the 
<A NAME="322"></A>way. And when we have gone through all the virtues, we will show, by the 
<A NAME="323"></A>grace of God, that the institutions of which I was speaking look to 
<A NAME="324"></A>virtue.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Very good; and suppose that you first criticize this 
<A NAME="326"></A>praiser of Zeus and the laws of Crete.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> I will try to criticize you and myself, as well as 
<A NAME="328"></A>him, for the argument is a common concern. Tell me-were not first the syssitia, 
<A NAME="329"></A>and secondly the gymnasia, invented by your legislator with a view to 
<A NAME="330"></A>war?
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And what comes third, and what fourth? For that, I think, 
<A NAME="333"></A>is the sort of enumeration which ought to be made of the remaining parts 
<A NAME="334"></A>of virtue, no matter whether you call them parts or what their name is, 
<A NAME="335"></A>provided the meaning is clear.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Then I, or any other Lacedaemonian, would reply that 
<A NAME="337"></A>hunting is third in order.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us see if we can discover what comes fourth and 
<A NAME="339"></A>fifth.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><B>Meg.</B> I think that I can get as far as the fouth head, which 
<A NAME="341"></A>is the frequent endurance of pain, exhibited among us Spartans in certain 
<A NAME="342"></A>hand-to-hand fights; also in stealing with the prospect of getting a good 
<A NAME="343"></A>beating; there is, too, the so-called Crypteia, or secret service, in which 
<A NAME="344"></A>wonderful endurance is shown-our people wander over the whole country by 
<A NAME="345"></A>day and by night, and even in winter have not a shoe to their foot, and 
<A NAME="346"></A>are without beds to lie upon, and have to attend upon themselves. Marvellous, 
<A NAME="347"></A>too, is the endurance which our citizens show in their naked exercises, 
<A NAME="348"></A>contending against the violent summer heat; and there are many similar 
<A NAME="349"></A>practices, to speak of which in detail would be endless.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Excellent, O Lacedaemonian Stranger. But how ought 
<A NAME="351"></A>we to define courage? Is it to be regarded only as a combat against fears 
<A NAME="352"></A>and pains, or also against desires and pleasures, and against flatteries; 
<A NAME="353"></A>which exercise such a tremendous power, that they make the hearts even 
<A NAME="354"></A>of respectable citizens to melt like wax?
<A NAME="355"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> I should say the latter.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In what preceded, as you will remember, our Cnosian friend 
<A NAME="357"></A>was speaking of a man or a city being inferior to themselves:-Were you 
<A NAME="358"></A>not, Cleinias?
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I was.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Now, which is in the truest sense inferior, the man who 
<A NAME="361"></A>is overcome by pleasure or by pain?
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I should say the man who is overcome by pleasure; for 
<A NAME="363"></A>all men deem him to be inferior in a more disgraceful sense, than the other 
<A NAME="364"></A>who is overcome by pain.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> But surely the lawgivers of Crete and Lacedaemon have 
<A NAME="366"></A>not legislated for a courage which is lame of one leg, able only to meet 
<A NAME="367"></A>attacks which come from the left, but impotent against the insidious flatteries 
<A NAME="368"></A>which come from the right?
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Able to meet both, I should say.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then let me once more ask, what institutions have you in 
<A NAME="371"></A>either of your states which give a taste of pleasures, and do not avoid 
<A NAME="372"></A>them any more than they avoid pains; but which set a person in the midst 
<A NAME="373"></A>of them, and compel or induce him by the prospect of reward to get the 
<A NAME="374"></A>better of them? Where is an ordinance about pleasure similar to that about 
<A NAME="375"></A>pain to be found in your laws? Tell me what there is of this nature among 
<A NAME="376"></A>you:-What is there which makes your citizen equally brave against pleasure 
<A NAME="377"></A>and pain, conquering what they ought to conquer, and superior to the enemies 
<A NAME="378"></A>who are most dangerous and nearest home?
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> I was able to tell you, Stranger, many laws which were 
<A NAME="380"></A>directed against pain; but I do not know that I can point out any great 
<A NAME="381"></A>or obvious examples of similar institutions which are concerned with pleasure; 
<A NAME="382"></A>there are some lesser provisions, however, which I might 
<A NAME="383"></A>mention.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Neither can I show anything of that sort which is at 
<A NAME="385"></A>all equally prominent in the Cretan laws.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> No wonder, my dear friends; and if, as is very likely, 
<A NAME="387"></A>in our search after the true and good, one of us may have to censure the 
<A NAME="388"></A>laws of the others, we must not be offended, but take kindly what another 
<A NAME="389"></A>says.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> You are quite right, Athenian Stranger, and we will 
<A NAME="391"></A>do as you say.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> At our time of life, Cleinias, there should be no feeling 
<A NAME="393"></A>of irritation.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I will not at present determine whether he who censures 
<A NAME="396"></A>the Cretan or Lacedaemonian polities is right or wrong. But I believe that 
<A NAME="397"></A>I can tell better than either of you what the many say about them. For 
<A NAME="398"></A>assuming that you have reasonably good laws, one of the best of them will 
<A NAME="399"></A>be the law forbidding any young men to enquire which of them are right 
<A NAME="400"></A>or wrong; but with one mouth and one voice they must all agree that the 
<A NAME="401"></A>laws are all good, for they came from God; and any one who says the contrary 
<A NAME="402"></A>is not to be listened to. But an old man who remarks any defect in your 
<A NAME="403"></A>laws may communicate his observation to a ruler or to an equal in years 
<A NAME="404"></A>when no young man is present.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Exactly so, Stranger; and like a diviner, although 
<A NAME="406"></A>not there at the time, you seem to me quite to have hit the meaning of 
<A NAME="407"></A>the legislator, and to say what is most true.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> As there are no young men present, and the legislator 
<A NAME="409"></A>has given old men free licence, there will be no impropriety in our discussing 
<A NAME="410"></A>these very matters now that we are alone.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True. And therefore you may be as free as you like 
<A NAME="412"></A>in your censure of our laws, for there is no discredit in knowing what 
<A NAME="413"></A>is wrong; he who receives what is said in a generous and friendly spirit 
<A NAME="414"></A>will be all the better for it.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Very good; however, I am not going to say anything 
<A NAME="416"></A>against your laws until to the best of my ability I have examined them, 
<A NAME="417"></A>but I am going to raise doubts about them. For you are the only people 
<A NAME="418"></A>known to us, whether Greek or barbarian, whom the legislator commanded 
<A NAME="419"></A>to eschew all great pleasures and amusements and never to touch them; whereas 
<A NAME="420"></A>in the matter of pains or fears which we have just been discussing, he 
<A NAME="421"></A>thought that they who from infancy had always avoided pains and fears and 
<A NAME="422"></A>sorrows, when they were compelled to face them would run away from those 
<A NAME="423"></A>who were hardened in them, and would become their subjects. Now the legislator 
<A NAME="424"></A>ought to have considered that this was equally true of pleasure; he should 
<A NAME="425"></A>have said to himself, that if our citizens are from their youth upward 
<A NAME="426"></A>unacquainted with the greatest pleasures, and unused to endure amid the 
<A NAME="427"></A>temptations of pleasure, and are not disciplined to refrain from all things 
<A NAME="428"></A>evil, the sweet feeling of pleasure will overcome them just as fear would 
<A NAME="429"></A>overcome the former class; and in another, and even a worse manner, they 
<A NAME="430"></A>will be the slaves of those who are able to endure amid pleasures, and 
<A NAME="431"></A>have had the opportunity of enjoying them, they being often the worst of 
<A NAME="432"></A>mankind. One half of their souls will be a slave, the other half free; 
<A NAME="433"></A>and they will not be worthy to be called in the true sense men and freemen. 
<A NAME="434"></A>Tell me whether you assent to my words?
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> On first hearing, what you say appears to be the truth; 
<A NAME="436"></A>but to be hasty in coming to a conclusion about such important matters 
<A NAME="437"></A>would be very childish and simple.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Suppose, Cleinias and Megillus, that we consider the 
<A NAME="439"></A>virtue which follows next of those which we intended to discuss (for after 
<A NAME="440"></A>courage comes temperance), what institutions shall we find relating to 
<A NAME="441"></A>temperance, either in Crete or Lacedaemon, which, like your military institutions, 
<A NAME="442"></A>differ from those of any ordinary state.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> That is not an easy question to answer; still I should 
<A NAME="444"></A>say that the common meals and gymnastic exercises have been excellently 
<A NAME="445"></A>devised for the promotion both of temperance and courage.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> There seems to be a difficulty, Stranger, with regard 
<A NAME="447"></A>to states, in making words and facts coincide so that there can be no dispute 
<A NAME="448"></A>about them. As in the human body, the regimen which does good in one way 
<A NAME="449"></A>does harm in another; and we can hardly say that any one course of treatment 
<A NAME="450"></A>is adapted to a particular constitution. Now the gymnasia and common meals 
<A NAME="451"></A>do a great deal of good, and yet they are a source of evil in civil troubles; 
<A NAME="452"></A>as is shown in the case of the Milesian, and Boeotian, and Thurian youth, 
<A NAME="453"></A>among whom these institutions seem always to have had a tendency to degrade 
<A NAME="454"></A>the ancient and natural custom of love below the level, not only of man, 
<A NAME="455"></A>but of the beasts. The charge may be fairly brought against your cities 
<A NAME="456"></A>above all others, and is true also of most other states which especially 
<A NAME="457"></A>cultivate gymnastics. Whether such matters are to be regarded jestingly 
<A NAME="458"></A>or seriously, I think that the pleasure is to be deemed natural which arises 
<A NAME="459"></A>out of the intercourse between men and women; but that the intercourse 
<A NAME="460"></A>of men with men, or of women with women, is contrary to nature, and that 
<A NAME="461"></A>the bold attempt was originally due to unbridled lust. The Cretans are 
<A NAME="462"></A>always accused of having invented the story of Ganymede and Zeus because 
<A NAME="463"></A>they wanted to justify themselves in the enjoyment of unnatural pleasures 
<A NAME="464"></A>by the practice of the god whom they believe to have been their lawgiver. 
<A NAME="465"></A>Leaving the story, we may observe that any speculation about laws turns 
<A NAME="466"></A>almost entirely on pleasure and pain, both in states and in individuals: 
<A NAME="467"></A>these are two fountains which nature lets flow, and he who draws from them 
<A NAME="468"></A>where and when, and as much as he ought, is happy; and this holds of men 
<A NAME="469"></A>and animals-of individuals as well as states; and he who indulges in them 
<A NAME="470"></A>ignorantly and at the wrong time, is the reverse of 
<A NAME="471"></A>happy.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> I admit, Stranger, that your words are well spoken, 
<A NAME="473"></A>and I hardly know what to say in answer to you; but still I think that 
<A NAME="474"></A>the Spartan lawgiver was quite right in forbidding pleasure. Of the Cretan 
<A NAME="475"></A>laws, I shall leave the defence to my Cnosian friend. But the laws of Sparta, 
<A NAME="476"></A>in as far as they relate to pleasure, appear to me to be the best in the 
<A NAME="477"></A>world; for that which leads mankind in general into the wildest pleasure 
<A NAME="478"></A>and licence, and every other folly, the law has clean driven out; and neither 
<A NAME="479"></A>in the country nor in towns which are under the control of Sparta, will 
<A NAME="480"></A>you find revelries and the many incitements of every kind of pleasure which 
<A NAME="481"></A>accompany them; and any one who meets a drunken and disorderly person, 
<A NAME="482"></A>will immediately have him most severely punished, and will not let him 
<A NAME="483"></A>off on any pretence, not even at the time of a Dionysiac festival; although 
<A NAME="484"></A>I have remarked that this may happen at your performances "on the cart," 
<A NAME="485"></A>as they are called; and among our Tarentine colonists I have seen the whole 
<A NAME="486"></A>city drunk at a Dionysiac festival; but nothing of the sort happens among 
<A NAME="487"></A>us.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> O Lacedaemonian Stranger, these festivities are praiseworthy 
<A NAME="489"></A>where there is a spirit of endurance, but are very senseless when they 
<A NAME="490"></A>are under no regulations. In order to retaliate, an Athenian has only to 
<A NAME="491"></A>point out the licence which exists among your women. To all such accusations, 
<A NAME="492"></A>whether they are brought against the Tarentines, or us, or you, there is 
<A NAME="493"></A>one answer which exonerates the practice in question from impropriety. 
<A NAME="494"></A>When a stranger expresses wonder at the singularity of what he sees, any 
<A NAME="495"></A>inhabitant will naturally answer him:-Wonder not, O stranger; this is our 
<A NAME="496"></A>custom, and you may very likely have some other custom about the same things. 
<A NAME="497"></A>Now we are speaking, my friends, not about men in general, but about the 
<A NAME="498"></A>merits and defects of the lawgivers themselves. Let us then discourse a 
<A NAME="499"></A>little more at length about intoxication, which is a very important subject, 
<A NAME="500"></A>and will seriously task the discrimination of the legislator. I am not 
<A NAME="501"></A>speaking of drinking, or not drinking, wine at all, but of intoxication. 
<A NAME="502"></A>Are we to follow the custom of the Scythians, and Persians, and Carthaginians, 
<A NAME="503"></A>and Celts, and Iberians, and Thracians, who are all warlike nations, or 
<A NAME="504"></A>that of your countrymen, for they, as you say, altogether abstain? But 
<A NAME="505"></A>the Scythians and Thracians, both men and women, drink unmixed wine, which 
<A NAME="506"></A>they pour on their garments, and this they think a happy and glorious institution. 
<A NAME="507"></A>The Persians, again, are much given to other practices of luxury which 
<A NAME="508"></A>you reject, but they have more moderation in them than the Thracians and 
<A NAME="509"></A>Scythians.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> O best of men, we have only to take arms into our hands, 
<A NAME="511"></A>and we send all these nations flying before us.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Nay, my good friend, do not say that; there have been, 
<A NAME="513"></A>as there always will be, flights and pursuits of which no account can be 
<A NAME="514"></A>given, and therefore we cannot say that victory or defeat in battle affords 
<A NAME="515"></A>more than a doubtful proof of the goodness or badness of institutions. 
<A NAME="516"></A>For when the greater states conquer and enslave the lesser, as the Syracusans 
<A NAME="517"></A>have done the Locrians, who appear to be the best-governed people in their 
<A NAME="518"></A>part of the world, or as the Athenians have done the Ceans (and there are 
<A NAME="519"></A>ten thousand other instances of the same sort of thing), all this is not 
<A NAME="520"></A>to the point; let us endeavour rather to form a conclusion about each institution 
<A NAME="521"></A>in itself and say nothing, at present, of victories and defeats. Let us 
<A NAME="522"></A>only say that such and such a custom is honourable, and another not. And 
<A NAME="523"></A>first permit me to tell you how good and bad are to be estimated in reference 
<A NAME="524"></A>to these very matters.
<A NAME="525"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> How do you mean?
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> All those who are ready at a moment's notice to praise 
<A NAME="527"></A>or censure any practice which is matter of discussion, seem to me to proceed 
<A NAME="528"></A>in a wrong way. Let me give you an illustration of what I mean:-You may 
<A NAME="529"></A>suppose a person to be praising wheat as a good kind of food, whereupon 
<A NAME="530"></A>another person instantly blames wheat, without ever enquiring into its 
<A NAME="531"></A>effect or use, or in what way, or to whom, or with what, or in what state 
<A NAME="532"></A>and how, wheat is to be given. And that is just what we are doing in this 
<A NAME="533"></A>discussion. At the very mention of the word intoxication, one side is ready 
<A NAME="534"></A>with their praises and the other with their censures; which is absurd. 
<A NAME="535"></A>For either side adduce their witnesses and approvers, and some of us think 
<A NAME="536"></A>that we speak with authority because we have many witnesses; and others 
<A NAME="537"></A>because they see those who abstain conquering in battle, and this again 
<A NAME="538"></A>is disputed by us. Now I cannot say that I shall be satisfied, if we go 
<A NAME="539"></A>on discussing each of the remaining laws in the same way. And about this 
<A NAME="540"></A>very point of intoxication I should like to speak in another way, which 
<A NAME="541"></A>I hold to be the right one; for if number is to be the criterion, are there 
<A NAME="542"></A>not myriads upon myriads of nations ready to dispute the point with you, 
<A NAME="543"></A>who are only two cities?
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> I shall gladly welcome any method of enquiry which 
<A NAME="545"></A>is right.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let me put the matter thus:-Suppose a person to praise 
<A NAME="547"></A>the keeping of goats, and the creatures themselves as capital things to 
<A NAME="548"></A>have, and then some one who had seen goats feeding without a goatherd in 
<A NAME="549"></A>cultivated spots, and doing mischief, were to censure a goat or any other 
<A NAME="550"></A>animal who has no keeper, or a bad keeper, would there be any sense or 
<A NAME="551"></A>justice in such censure?
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Does a captain require only to have nautical knowledge 
<A NAME="554"></A>in order to be a good captain, whether he is sea-sick or not? What do you 
<A NAME="555"></A>say?
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> I say that he is not a good captain if, although he 
<A NAME="557"></A>have nautical skill, he is liable to sea-sickness.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> And what would you say of the commander of an army? 
<A NAME="559"></A>Will he be able to command merely because he has military skill if he be 
<A NAME="560"></A>a coward, who, when danger comes, is sick and drunk with 
<A NAME="561"></A>fear?
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Impossible.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And what if besides being a coward he has no 
<A NAME="564"></A>skill?
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><B>Meg.</B> He is a miserable fellow, not fit to be a commander of 
<A NAME="566"></A>men, but only of old women.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> And what would you say of some one who blames or praises 
<A NAME="568"></A>any sort of meeting which is intended by nature to have a ruler, and is 
<A NAME="569"></A>well enough when under his presidency? The critic, however, has never seen 
<A NAME="570"></A>the society meeting together at an orderly feast under the control of a 
<A NAME="571"></A>president, but always without a ruler or with a bad one:-when observers 
<A NAME="572"></A>of this class praise or blame such meetings, are we to suppose that what 
<A NAME="573"></A>they say is of any value?
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Certainly not, if they have never seen or been present 
<A NAME="575"></A>at such a meeting when rightly ordered.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Reflect; may not banqueters and banquets be said to 
<A NAME="577"></A>constitute a kind of meeting?
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And did any one ever see this sort of convivial meeting 
<A NAME="580"></A>rightly ordered? Of course you two will answer that you have never seen 
<A NAME="581"></A>them at all, because they are not customary or lawful in your country; 
<A NAME="582"></A>but I have come across many of them in many different places, and moreover 
<A NAME="583"></A>I have made enquiries about them wherever I went, as I may say, and never 
<A NAME="584"></A>did I see or hear of anything of the kind which was carried on altogether 
<A NAME="585"></A>rightly; in some few particulars they might be right, but in general they 
<A NAME="586"></A>were utterly wrong.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What do you mean, Stranger, by this remark? Explain; 
<A NAME="588"></A>For we, as you say, from our inexperience in such matters, might very likely 
<A NAME="589"></A>not know, even if they came in our way, what was right or wrong in such 
<A NAME="590"></A>societies.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Likely enough; then let me try to be your instructor: 
<A NAME="592"></A>You would acknowledge, would you not, that in all gatherings of man, kind, 
<A NAME="593"></A>of whatever sort, there ought to be a leader?
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly I should.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And we were saying just now, that when men are at war the 
<A NAME="596"></A>leader ought to be a brave man?
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> We were.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The brave man is less likely than the coward to be disturbed 
<A NAME="599"></A>by fears?
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That again is true.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And if there were a possibility of having a general of 
<A NAME="602"></A>an army who was absolutely fearless and imperturbable, should we not by 
<A NAME="603"></A>all means appoint him?
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Assuredly.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Now, however, we are speaking not of a general who is to 
<A NAME="606"></A>command an army, when foe meets foe in time of war, but of one who is to 
<A NAME="607"></A>regulate meetings of another sort, when friend meets friend in time of 
<A NAME="608"></A>peace.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And that sort of meeting, if attended with drunkenness, 
<A NAME="611"></A>is apt to be unquiet.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly; the reverse of quiet.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In the first place, then, the revellers as well as the 
<A NAME="614"></A>soldiers will require a ruler?
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To be sure; no men more so.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And we ought, if possible, to provide them with a quiet 
<A NAME="617"></A>ruler?
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And he should be a man who understands society; for his 
<A NAME="620"></A>duty is to preserve the friendly feelings which exist among the company 
<A NAME="621"></A>at the time, and to increase them for the future by his use of the 
<A NAME="622"></A>occasion.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Must we not appoint a sober man and a wise to be our master 
<A NAME="625"></A>of the revels? For if the ruler of drinkers be himself young and drunken, 
<A NAME="626"></A>and not over-wise, only by some special good fortune will he be saved from 
<A NAME="627"></A>doing some great evil.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> It will be by a singular good fortune that he is 
<A NAME="629"></A>saved.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Now suppose such associations to be framed in the best 
<A NAME="631"></A>way possible in states, and that some one blames the very fact of their 
<A NAME="632"></A>existence-he may very likely be right. But if he blames a practice which 
<A NAME="633"></A>he only sees very much mismanaged, he shows in the first place that he 
<A NAME="634"></A>is not aware of the mismanagement, and also not aware that everything done 
<A NAME="635"></A>in this way will turn out to be wrong, because done without the superintendence 
<A NAME="636"></A>of a sober ruler. Do you not see that a drunken pilot or a drunken ruler 
<A NAME="637"></A>of any sort will ruin ship, chariot, army-anything, in short, of which 
<A NAME="638"></A>he has the direction?
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> The last remark is very true, Stranger; and I see quite 
<A NAME="640"></A>clearly the advantage of an army having a good leader-he will give victory 
<A NAME="641"></A>in war to his followers, which is a very great advantage; and so of other 
<A NAME="642"></A>things. But I do not see any similar advantage which either individuals 
<A NAME="643"></A>or states gain from the good management of a feast; and I want you to tell 
<A NAME="644"></A>me what great good will be effected, supposing that this drinking ordinance 
<A NAME="645"></A>is duly established.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> If you mean to ask what great good accrues to the state 
<A NAME="647"></A>from the right training of a single youth, or of a single chorus-when the 
<A NAME="648"></A>question is put in that form, we cannot deny that the good is not very 
<A NAME="649"></A>great in any particular instance. But if you ask what is the good of education 
<A NAME="650"></A>in general, the answer is easy-that education makes good men, and that 
<A NAME="651"></A>good men act nobly, and conquer their enemies in battle, because they are 
<A NAME="652"></A>good. Education certainly gives victory, although victory sometimes produces 
<A NAME="653"></A>forgetfulness of education; for many have grown insolent from victory in 
<A NAME="654"></A>war, and this insolence has engendered in them innumerable evils; and many 
<A NAME="655"></A>a victory has been and will be suicidal to the victors; but education is 
<A NAME="656"></A>never suicidal.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> You seem to imply, my friend, that convivial meetings, 
<A NAME="658"></A>when rightly ordered, are an important element of education.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Certainly I do.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> And can you show that what you have been saying is 
<A NAME="661"></A>true?
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> To be absolutely sure of the truth of matters concerning 
<A NAME="663"></A>which there are many opinions, is an attribute of the Gods not given to 
<A NAME="664"></A>man, Stranger; but I shall be very happy to tell you what I think, especially 
<A NAME="665"></A>as we are now proposing to enter on a discussion concerning laws and 
<A NAME="666"></A>constitutions.
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Your opinion, Stranger, about the questions which are 
<A NAME="668"></A>now being raised, is precisely what we want to hear.
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Very good; I will try to find a way of explaining my 
<A NAME="670"></A>meaning, and you shall try to have the gift of understanding me. But first 
<A NAME="671"></A>let me make an apology. The Athenian citizen is reputed among all the Hellenes 
<A NAME="672"></A>to be a great talker, whereas Sparta is renowned for brevity, and the Cretans 
<A NAME="673"></A>have more wit than words. Now I am afraid of appearing to elicit a very 
<A NAME="674"></A>long discourse out of very small materials. For drinking indeed may appear 
<A NAME="675"></A>to be a slight matter, and yet is one which cannot be rightly ordered according 
<A NAME="676"></A>to nature, without correct principles of music; these are necessary to 
<A NAME="677"></A>any clear or satisfactory treatment of the subject, and music again runs 
<A NAME="678"></A>up into education generally, and there is much to be said about all this. 
<A NAME="679"></A>What would you say then to leaving these matters for the present, and passing 
<A NAME="680"></A>on to some other question of law?
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> O Athenian Stranger, let me tell you what perhaps you 
<A NAME="682"></A>do not know, that our family is the proxenus of your state. I imagine that 
<A NAME="683"></A>from their earliest youth all boys, when they are told that they are the 
<A NAME="684"></A>proxeni of a particular state, feel kindly towards their second and this 
<A NAME="685"></A>has certainly been my own feeling. I can well remember from the days of 
<A NAME="686"></A>my boyhood, how, when any Lacedaemonians praised or blamed the Athenians, 
<A NAME="687"></A>they used to say to me-"See, Megillus, how ill or how well," as the case 
<A NAME="688"></A>might be, "has your state treated us"; and having always had to fight your 
<A NAME="689"></A>battles against detractors when I heard you assailed, I became warmly attached 
<A NAME="690"></A>to you. And I always like to hear the Athenian tongue spoken; the common 
<A NAME="691"></A>saying is quite true, that a good Athenian is more than ordinarily good, 
<A NAME="692"></A>for he is the only man who is freely and genuinely good by the divine inspiration 
<A NAME="693"></A>of his own nature, and is not manufactured. Therefore be assured that I 
<A NAME="694"></A>shall like to hear you say whatever you have to say.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes, Stranger; and when you have heard me speak, say 
<A NAME="696"></A>boldly what is in your thoughts. Let me remind you of a tie which unites 
<A NAME="697"></A>you to Crete. You must have heard here the story of the prophet Epimenides, 
<A NAME="698"></A>who was of my family, and came to Athens ten years before the Persian war, 
<A NAME="699"></A>in accordance with the response of the Oracle, and offered certain sacrifices 
<A NAME="700"></A>which the God commanded. The Athenians were at that time in dread of the 
<A NAME="701"></A>Persian invasion; and he said that for ten years they would not come, and 
<A NAME="702"></A>that when they came, they would go away again without accomplishing any 
<A NAME="703"></A>of their objects, and would suffer more evil than they inflicted. At that 
<A NAME="704"></A>time my forefathers formed ties of hospitality with you; thus ancient is 
<A NAME="705"></A>the friendship which I and my parents have had for you.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> You seem to be quite ready to listen; and I am also 
<A NAME="707"></A>ready to perform as much as I can of an almost impossible task, which I 
<A NAME="708"></A>will nevertheless attempt. At the outset of the discussion, let me define 
<A NAME="709"></A>the nature and power of education; for this is the way by which our argument 
<A NAME="710"></A>must travel onwards to the God Dionysus.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Let us proceed, if you please.
<A NAME="712"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Well, then, if I tell you what are my notions of education, 
<A NAME="713"></A>will you consider whether they satisfy you?
<A NAME="714"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Let us hear.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> According to my view, any one who would be good at anything 
<A NAME="716"></A>must practise that thing from his youth upwards, both in sport and earnest, 
<A NAME="717"></A>in its several branches: for example, he who is to be a good builder, should 
<A NAME="718"></A>play at building children's houses; he who is to be a good husbandman, 
<A NAME="719"></A>at tilling the ground; and those who have the care of their education should 
<A NAME="720"></A>provide them when young with mimic tools. They should learn beforehand 
<A NAME="721"></A>the knowledge which they will afterwards require for their art. For example, 
<A NAME="722"></A>the future carpenter should learn to measure or apply the line in play; 
<A NAME="723"></A>and the future warrior should learn riding, or some other exercise, for 
<A NAME="724"></A>amusement, and the teacher should endeavour to direct the children's inclinations 
<A NAME="725"></A>and pleasures, by the help of amusements, to their final aim in life. The 
<A NAME="726"></A>most important part of education is right training in the nursery. The 
<A NAME="727"></A>soul of the child in his play should be guided to the love of that sort 
<A NAME="728"></A>of excellence in which when he grows up to manhood he will have to be perfected. 
<A NAME="729"></A>Do you agree with me thus far?
<A NAME="730"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then let us not leave the meaning of education ambiguous 
<A NAME="732"></A>or ill-defined. At present, when we speak in terms of praise or blame about 
<A NAME="733"></A>the bringing-up of each person, we call one man educated and another uneducated, 
<A NAME="734"></A>although the uneducated man may be sometimes very well educated for the 
<A NAME="735"></A>calling of a retail trader, or of a captain of a ship, and the like. For 
<A NAME="736"></A>we are not speaking of education in this narrower sense, but of that other 
<A NAME="737"></A>education in virtue from youth upwards, which makes a man eagerly pursue 
<A NAME="738"></A>the ideal perfection of citizenship, and teaches him how rightly to rule 
<A NAME="739"></A>and how to obey. This is the only education which, upon our view, deserves 
<A NAME="740"></A>the name; that other sort of training, which aims at the acquisition of 
<A NAME="741"></A>wealth or bodily strength, or mere cleverness apart from intelligence and 
<A NAME="742"></A>justice, is mean and illiberal, and is not worthy to be called education 
<A NAME="743"></A>at all. But let us not quarrel with one another about a word, provided 
<A NAME="744"></A>that the proposition which has just been granted hold good: to wit, that 
<A NAME="745"></A>those who are rightly educated generally become good men. Neither must 
<A NAME="746"></A>we cast a slight upon education, which is the first and fairest thing that 
<A NAME="747"></A>the best of men can ever have, and which, though liable to take a wrong 
<A NAME="748"></A>direction, is capable of reformation. And this work of reformation is the 
<A NAME="749"></A>great business of every man while he lives.
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true; and we entirely agree with 
<A NAME="751"></A>you.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And we agreed before that they are good men who are able 
<A NAME="753"></A>to rule themselves, and bad men who are not.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> You are quite right.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let me now proceed, if I can, to clear up the subject a 
<A NAME="756"></A>little further by an illustration which I will offer 
<A NAME="757"></A>you.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Proceed.
<A NAME="759"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Do we not consider each of ourselves to be 
<A NAME="760"></A>one?
<A NAME="761"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> We do.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And each one of us has in his bosom two counsellors, both 
<A NAME="763"></A>foolish and also antagonistic; of which we call the one pleasure, and the 
<A NAME="764"></A>other pain.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Exactly.
<A NAME="766"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Also there are opinions about the future, which have the 
<A NAME="767"></A>general name of expectations; and the specific name of fear, when the expectation 
<A NAME="768"></A>is of pain; and of hope, when of pleasure; and further, there is reflection 
<A NAME="769"></A>about the good or evil of them, and this, when embodied in a decree by 
<A NAME="770"></A>the State, is called Law.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I am hardly able to follow you; proceed, however, as 
<A NAME="772"></A>if I were.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><B>Meg.</B> I am in the like case.
<A NAME="774"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us look at the matter thus: May we not conceive each 
<A NAME="775"></A>of us living beings to be a puppet of the Gods, either their plaything 
<A NAME="776"></A>only, or created with a purpose-which of the two we cannot certainly know? 
<A NAME="777"></A>But we do know, that these affections in us are like cords and strings, 
<A NAME="778"></A>which pull us different and opposite ways, and to opposite actions; and 
<A NAME="779"></A>herein lies the difference between virtue and vice. According to the argument 
<A NAME="780"></A>there is one among these cords which every man ought to grasp and never 
<A NAME="781"></A>let go, but to pull with it against all the rest; and this is the sacred 
<A NAME="782"></A>and golden cord of reason, called by us the common law of the State; there 
<A NAME="783"></A>are others which are hard and of iron, but this one is soft because golden; 
<A NAME="784"></A>and there are several other kinds. Now we ought always to cooperate with 
<A NAME="785"></A>the lead of the best, which is law. For inasmuch as reason is beautiful 
<A NAME="786"></A>and gentle, and not violent, her rule must needs have ministers in order 
<A NAME="787"></A>to help the golden principle in vanquishing the other principles. And thus 
<A NAME="788"></A>the moral of the tale about our being puppets will not have been lost, 
<A NAME="789"></A>and the meaning of the expression "superior or inferior to a man's self" 
<A NAME="790"></A>will become clearer; and the individual, attaining to right reason in this 
<A NAME="791"></A>matter of pulling the strings of the puppet, should live according to its 
<A NAME="792"></A>rule; while the city, receiving the same from some god or from one who 
<A NAME="793"></A>has knowledge of these things, should embody it in a law, to be her guide 
<A NAME="794"></A>in her dealings with herself and with other states. In this way virtue 
<A NAME="795"></A>and vice will be more clearly distinguished by us. And when they have become 
<A NAME="796"></A>clearer, education and other institutions will in like manner become clearer; 
<A NAME="797"></A>and in particular that question of convivial entertainment, which may seem, 
<A NAME="798"></A>perhaps, to have been a very trifling matter, and to have taken a great 
<A NAME="799"></A>many more words than were necessary.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Perhaps, however, the theme may turn out not to be 
<A NAME="801"></A>unworthy of the length of discourse.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Very good; let us proceed with any enquiry which really 
<A NAME="803"></A>bears on our present object.
<A NAME="804"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Proceed.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Suppose that we give this puppet of ours drink-what will 
<A NAME="806"></A>be the effect on him?
<A NAME="807"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Having what in view do you ask that 
<A NAME="808"></A>question?
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Nothing as yet; but I ask generally, when the puppet is 
<A NAME="810"></A>brought to the drink, what sort of result is likely to follow. I will endeavour 
<A NAME="811"></A>to explain my meaning more clearly: what I am now asking is this-Does the 
<A NAME="812"></A>drinking of wine heighten and increase pleasures and pains, and passions 
<A NAME="813"></A>and loves?
<A NAME="814"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very greatly.
<A NAME="815"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And are perception and memory, and opinion and prudence, 
<A NAME="816"></A>heightened and increased? Do not these qualities entirely desert a man 
<A NAME="817"></A>if he becomes saturated with drink?
<A NAME="818"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes, they entirely desert him.
<A NAME="819"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Does he not return to the state of soul in which he was 
<A NAME="820"></A>when a young child?
<A NAME="821"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> He does.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then at that time he will have the least control over 
<A NAME="823"></A>himself?
<A NAME="824"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> The least.
<A NAME="825"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And will he not be in a most wretched 
<A NAME="826"></A>plight?
<A NAME="827"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Most wretched.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then not only an old man but also a drunkard becomes a 
<A NAME="829"></A>second time a child?
<A NAME="830"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Well said, Stranger.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Is there any argument which will prove to us that we ought 
<A NAME="832"></A>to encourage the taste for drinking instead of doing all we can to avoid 
<A NAME="833"></A>it?
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I suppose that there is; you at any rate, were just 
<A NAME="835"></A>now saying that you were ready to maintain such a doctrine.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> True, I was; and I am ready still, seeing that you 
<A NAME="837"></A>have both declared that you are anxious to hear me.
<A NAME="838"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To sure we are, if only for the strangeness of the 
<A NAME="839"></A>paradox, which asserts that a man ought of his own accord to plunge into 
<A NAME="840"></A>utter degradation.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Are you speaking of the soul?
<A NAME="842"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And what would you say about the body, my friend? Are you 
<A NAME="844"></A>not surprised at any one of his own accord bringing upon himself deformity, 
<A NAME="845"></A>leanness, ugliness, decrepitude?
<A NAME="846"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yet when a man goes of his own accord to a doctor's shop, 
<A NAME="848"></A>and takes medicine, is he not aware that soon, and for many days afterwards, 
<A NAME="849"></A>he will be in a state of body which he would die rather than accept as 
<A NAME="850"></A>the permanent condition of his life? Are not those who train in gymnasia, 
<A NAME="851"></A>at first beginning reduced to a state of weakness?
<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes, all that is well known.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Also that they go of their own accord for the sake of the 
<A NAME="854"></A>subsequent benefit?
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="856"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And we may conceive this to be true in the same way of 
<A NAME="857"></A>other practices?
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And the same view may be taken of the pastime of drinking 
<A NAME="860"></A>wine, if we are right in supposing that the same good effect 
<A NAME="861"></A>follows?
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="863"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> If such convivialities should turn out to have any advantage 
<A NAME="864"></A>equal in importance to that of gymnastic, they are in their very nature 
<A NAME="865"></A>to be preferred to mere bodily exercise, inasmuch as they have no accompaniment 
<A NAME="866"></A>of pain.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True; but I hardly think that we shall be able to discover 
<A NAME="868"></A>any such benefits to be derived from them.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> That is just what we must endeavour to show. And let 
<A NAME="870"></A>me ask you a question:-Do we not distinguish two kinds of fear, which are 
<A NAME="871"></A>very different?
<A NAME="872"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What are they?
<A NAME="873"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> There is the fear of expected evil.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And there is the fear of an evil reputation; we are afraid 
<A NAME="876"></A>of being thought evil, because we do or say some dishonourable thing, which 
<A NAME="877"></A>fear we and all men term shame.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> These are the two fears, as I called them; one of which 
<A NAME="880"></A>is the opposite of pain and other fears, and the opposite also of the greatest 
<A NAME="881"></A>and most numerous sort of pleasures.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="883"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And does not the legislator and every one who is good for 
<A NAME="884"></A>anything, hold this fear in the greatest honour? This is what he terms 
<A NAME="885"></A>reverence, and the confidence which is the reverse of this he terms insolence; 
<A NAME="886"></A>and the latter he always deems to be a very great evil both to individuals 
<A NAME="887"></A>and to states.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="889"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Does not this kind of fear preserve us in many important 
<A NAME="890"></A>ways? What is there which so surely gives victory and safety in war? For 
<A NAME="891"></A>there are two things which give victory-confidence before enemies, and 
<A NAME="892"></A>fear of disgrace before friends.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> There are.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then each of us should be fearless and also fearful; and 
<A NAME="895"></A>why we should be either has now been determined.
<A NAME="896"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="897"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And when we want to make any one fearless, we and the law 
<A NAME="898"></A>bring him face to face with many fears.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Clearly.
<A NAME="900"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And when we want to make him rightly fearful, must we not 
<A NAME="901"></A>introduce him to shameless pleasures, and train him to take up arms against 
<A NAME="902"></A>them, and to overcome them? Or does this principle apply to courage only, 
<A NAME="903"></A>and must he who would be perfect in valour fight against and overcome his 
<A NAME="904"></A>own natural character-since if he be unpractised and inexperienced in such 
<A NAME="905"></A>conflicts, he will not be half the man which he might have been-and are 
<A NAME="906"></A>we to suppose, that with temperance it is otherwise, and that he who has 
<A NAME="907"></A>never fought with the shameless and unrighteous temptations of his pleasures 
<A NAME="908"></A>and lusts, and conquered them, in earnest and in play, by word, deed, and 
<A NAME="909"></A>act, will still be perfectly temperate?
<A NAME="910"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> A most unlikely supposition.
<A NAME="911"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Suppose that some God had given a fear-potion to men, and 
<A NAME="912"></A>that the more a man drank of this the more he regarded himself at every 
<A NAME="913"></A>draught as a child of misfortune, and that he feared everything happening 
<A NAME="914"></A>or about to happen to him; and that at last the most courageous of men 
<A NAME="915"></A>utterly lost his presence of mind for a time, and only came to himself 
<A NAME="916"></A>again when he had slept off the influence of the draught.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> But has such a draught, Stranger, ever really been 
<A NAME="918"></A>known among men?
<A NAME="919"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> No; but, if there had been, might not such a draught 
<A NAME="920"></A>have been of use to the legislator as a test of courage? Might we not go 
<A NAME="921"></A>and say to him, "O legislator, whether you are legislating for the Cretan, 
<A NAME="922"></A>or for any other state, would you not like to have a touchstone of the 
<A NAME="923"></A>courage and cowardice of your citizens?"
<A NAME="924"></A><BR><BR>Cle. "I should," will be the answer of every 
<A NAME="925"></A>one.
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>Ath. "And you would rather have a touchstone in which there is no risk 
<A NAME="927"></A>and no great danger than the reverse?"
<A NAME="928"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> In that proposition every one may safely 
<A NAME="929"></A>agree.
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>Ath. "And in order to make use of the draught, you would lead them 
<A NAME="931"></A>amid these imaginary terrors, and prove them, when the affection of fear 
<A NAME="932"></A>was working upon them, and compel them to be fearless, exhorting and admonishing 
<A NAME="933"></A>them; and also honouring them, but dishonouring any one who will not be 
<A NAME="934"></A>persuaded by you to be in all respects such as you command him; and if 
<A NAME="935"></A>he underwent the trial well and manfully, you would let him go unscathed; 
<A NAME="936"></A>but if ill, you would inflict a punishment upon him? Or would you abstain 
<A NAME="937"></A>from using the potion altogether, although you have no reason for 
<A NAME="938"></A>abstaining?"
<A NAME="939"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> He would be certain, Stranger, to use the 
<A NAME="940"></A>potion.
<A NAME="941"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> This would be a mode of testing and training which would 
<A NAME="942"></A>be wonderfully easy in comparison with those now in use, and might be applied 
<A NAME="943"></A>to a single person, or to a few, or indeed to any number; and he would 
<A NAME="944"></A>do well who provided himself with the potion only, rather than with any 
<A NAME="945"></A>number of other things, whether he preferred to be by himself in solitude, 
<A NAME="946"></A>and there contend with his fears, because he was ashamed to be seen by 
<A NAME="947"></A>the eye of man until he was perfect; or trusting to the force of his own 
<A NAME="948"></A>nature and habits, and believing that he had been already disciplined sufficiently, 
<A NAME="949"></A>he did not hesitate to train himself in company with any number of others, 
<A NAME="950"></A>and display his power in conquering the irresistible change effected by 
<A NAME="951"></A>the draught-his virtue being such, that he never in any instance fell into 
<A NAME="952"></A>any great unseemliness, but was always himself, and left off before he 
<A NAME="953"></A>arrived at the last cup, fearing that he, like all other men, might be 
<A NAME="954"></A>overcome by the potion.
<A NAME="955"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes, Stranger, in that last case, too, he might equally 
<A NAME="956"></A>show his self-control.
<A NAME="957"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us return to the lawgiver, and say to him:-"Well, 
<A NAME="958"></A>lawgiver, there is certainly no such fear-potion which man has either received 
<A NAME="959"></A>from the Gods or himself discovered; for witchcraft has no place at our 
<A NAME="960"></A>board. But is there any potion which might serve as a test of overboldness 
<A NAME="961"></A>and excessive and indiscreet boasting?
<A NAME="962"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I suppose that he will say, Yes-meaning that wine is 
<A NAME="963"></A>such a potion.
<A NAME="964"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Is not the effect of this quite the opposite of the 
<A NAME="965"></A>effect of the other? When a man drinks wine he begins to be better pleased 
<A NAME="966"></A>with himself, and the more he drinks the more he is filled full of brave 
<A NAME="967"></A>hopes, and conceit of his power, and at last the string of his tongue is 
<A NAME="968"></A>loosened, and fancying himself wise, he is brimming over with lawlessness, 
<A NAME="969"></A>and has no more fear or respect, and is ready to do or say 
<A NAME="970"></A>anything.
<A NAME="971"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I think that every one will admit the truth of your 
<A NAME="972"></A>description.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Now, let us remember, as we were saying, that there are 
<A NAME="975"></A>two things which should be cultivated in the soul: first, the greatest 
<A NAME="976"></A>courage; secondly, the greatest fear-
<A NAME="977"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Which you said to be characteristic of reverence, if 
<A NAME="978"></A>I am not mistaken.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Thank you for reminding me. But now, as the habit of 
<A NAME="980"></A>courage and fearlessness is to be trained amid fears, let us consider whether 
<A NAME="981"></A>the opposite quality is not also to be trained among 
<A NAME="982"></A>opposites.
<A NAME="983"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That is probably the case.
<A NAME="984"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> There are times and seasons at which we are by nature more 
<A NAME="985"></A>than commonly valiant and bold; now we ought to train ourselves on these 
<A NAME="986"></A>occasions to be as free from impudence and shamelessness as possible, and 
<A NAME="987"></A>to be afraid to say or suffer or do anything that is 
<A NAME="988"></A>base.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="990"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Are not the moments in which we are apt to be bold and 
<A NAME="991"></A>shameless such as these?-when we are under the influence of anger, love, 
<A NAME="992"></A>pride, ignorance, avarice, cowardice? or when wealth, beauty, strength, 
<A NAME="993"></A>and all the intoxicating workings of pleasure madden us? What is better 
<A NAME="994"></A>adapted than the festive use of wine, in the first place to test, and in 
<A NAME="995"></A>the second place to train the character of a man, if care be taken in the 
<A NAME="996"></A>use of it? What is there cheaper, or more innocent? For do but consider 
<A NAME="997"></A>which is the greater risk:-Would you rather test a man of a morose and 
<A NAME="998"></A>savage nature, which is the source of ten thousand acts of injustice, by 
<A NAME="999"></A>making bargains with him at a risk to yourself, or by having him as a companion 
<A NAME="1000"></A>at the festival of Dionysus? Or would you, if you wanted to apply a touchstone 
<A NAME="1001"></A>to a man who is prone to love, entrust your wife, or your sons, or daughters 
<A NAME="1002"></A>to him, perilling your dearest interests in order to have a view of the 
<A NAME="1003"></A>condition of his soul? I might mention numberless cases, in which the advantage 
<A NAME="1004"></A>would be manifest of getting to know a character in sport, and without 
<A NAME="1005"></A>paying dearly for experience. And I do not believe that either a Cretan, 
<A NAME="1006"></A>or any other man, will doubt that such a test is a fair test, and safer, 
<A NAME="1007"></A>cheaper, and speedier than any other.
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That is certainly true.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And this knowledge of the natures and habits of men's souls 
<A NAME="1010"></A>will be of the greatest use in that art which has the management of them; 
<A NAME="1011"></A>and that art, if I am not mistaken, is politics.
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Exactly so.
