<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Athenian Stranger. And now we have to consider whether the insight into 
<A NAME="11"></A>human nature is the only benefit derived from well ordered potations, or 
<A NAME="12"></A>whether there are not other advantages great and much to be desired. The 
<A NAME="13"></A>argument seems to imply that there are. But how and in what way these are 
<A NAME="14"></A>to be attained, will have to be considered attentively, or we may be entangled 
<A NAME="15"></A>in error.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR><B>Cleinias.</B> Proceed.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let me once more recall our doctrine of right education; 
<A NAME="18"></A>which, if I am not mistaken, depends on the due regulation of convivial 
<A NAME="19"></A>intercourse.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> You talk rather grandly.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Pleasure and pain I maintain to be the first perceptions 
<A NAME="22"></A>of children, and I say that they are the forms under which virtue and vice 
<A NAME="23"></A>are originally present to them. As to wisdom and true and fixed opinions, 
<A NAME="24"></A>happy is the man who acquires them, even when declining in years; and we 
<A NAME="25"></A>may say that he who possesses them, and the blessings which are contained 
<A NAME="26"></A>in them, is a perfect man. Now I mean by education that training which 
<A NAME="27"></A>is given by suitable habits to the first instincts of virtue in children;-when 
<A NAME="28"></A>pleasure, and friendship, and pain, and hatred, are rightly implanted in 
<A NAME="29"></A>souls not yet capable of understanding the nature of them, and who find 
<A NAME="30"></A>them, after they have attained reason, to be in harmony with her. This 
<A NAME="31"></A>harmony of the soul, taken as a whole, is virtue; but the particular training 
<A NAME="32"></A>in respect of pleasure and pain, which leads you always to hate what you 
<A NAME="33"></A>ought to hate, and love what you ought to love from the beginning of life 
<A NAME="34"></A>to the end, may be separated off; and, in my view, will be rightly called 
<A NAME="35"></A>education.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I think, Stranger, that you are quite right in all 
<A NAME="37"></A>that you have said and are saying about education.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> I am glad to hear that you agree with me; for, indeed, 
<A NAME="39"></A>the discipline of pleasure and pain which, when rightly ordered, is a principle 
<A NAME="40"></A>of education, has been often relaxed and corrupted in human life. And the 
<A NAME="41"></A>Gods, pitying the toils which our race is born to undergo, have appointed 
<A NAME="42"></A>holy festivals, wherein men alternate rest with labour; and have given 
<A NAME="43"></A>them the Muses and Apollo, the leader of the Muses, and Dionysus, to be 
<A NAME="44"></A>companions in their revels, that they may improve their education by taking 
<A NAME="45"></A>part in the festivals of the Gods, and with their help. I should like to 
<A NAME="46"></A>know whether a common saying is in our opinion true to nature or not. For 
<A NAME="47"></A>men say that the young of all creatures cannot be quiet in their bodies 
<A NAME="48"></A>or in their voices; they are always wanting to move and cry out; some leaping 
<A NAME="49"></A>and skipping, and overflowing with sportiveness and delight at something, 
<A NAME="50"></A>others uttering all sorts of cries. But, whereas the animals have no perception 
<A NAME="51"></A>of order or disorder in their movements, that is, of rhythm or harmony, 
<A NAME="52"></A>as they are called, to us, the Gods, who, as we say, have been appointed 
<A NAME="53"></A>to be our companions in the dance, have given the pleasurable sense of 
<A NAME="54"></A>harmony and rhythm; and so they stir us into life, and we follow them, 
<A NAME="55"></A>joining hands together in dances and songs; and these they call choruses, 
<A NAME="56"></A>which is a term naturally expressive of cheerfulness. Shall we begin, then, 
<A NAME="57"></A>with the acknowledgment that education is first given through Apollo and 
<A NAME="58"></A>the Muses? What do you say?
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I assent.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And the uneducated is he who has not been trained in the 
<A NAME="61"></A>chorus, and the educated is he who has been well trained?
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And the chorus is made up of two parts, dance and 
<A NAME="64"></A>song?
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then he who is well educated will be able to sing and dance 
<A NAME="67"></A>well?
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I suppose that he will.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us see; what are we saying?
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> What?
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> He sings well and dances well; now must we add that he 
<A NAME="72"></A>sings what is good and dances what is good?
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Let us make the addition.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> We will suppose that he knows the good to be good, and 
<A NAME="75"></A>the bad to be bad, and makes use of them accordingly: which now is the 
<A NAME="76"></A>better trained in dancing and music-he who is able to move his body and 
<A NAME="77"></A>to use his voice in what is understood to be the right manner, but has 
<A NAME="78"></A>no delight in good or hatred of evil; or he who is incorrect in gesture 
<A NAME="79"></A>and voice, but is right in his sense of pleasure and pain, and welcomes 
<A NAME="80"></A>what is good, and is offended at what is evil?
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> There is a great difference, Stranger, in the two kinds 
<A NAME="82"></A>of education.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> If we three know what is good in song and dance, then 
<A NAME="84"></A>we truly know also who is educated and who is uneducated; but if not, then 
<A NAME="85"></A>we certainly shall not know wherein lies the safeguard of education, and 
<A NAME="86"></A>whether there is any or not.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us follow the scent like hounds, and go in pursuit 
<A NAME="89"></A>of beauty of figure, and melody, and song, and dance; if these escape us, 
<A NAME="90"></A>there will be no use in talking about true education, whether Hellenic 
<A NAME="91"></A>or barbarian.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And what is beauty of figure, or beautiful melody? When 
<A NAME="94"></A>a manly soul is in trouble, and when a cowardly soul is in similar case, 
<A NAME="95"></A>are they likely to use the same figures and gestures, or to give utterance 
<A NAME="96"></A>to the same sounds?
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How can they, when the very colours of their faces 
<A NAME="98"></A>differ?
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Good, my friend; I may observe, however, in passing, that 
<A NAME="100"></A>in music there certainly are figures and there are melodies: and music 
<A NAME="101"></A>is concerned with harmony and rhythm, so that you may speak of a melody 
<A NAME="102"></A>or figure having good rhythm or good harmony-the term is correct enough; 
<A NAME="103"></A>but to speak metaphorically of a melody or figure having a "good colour," 
<A NAME="104"></A>as the masters of choruses do, is not allowable, although you can speak 
<A NAME="105"></A>of the melodies or figures of the brave and the coward, praising the one 
<A NAME="106"></A>and censuring the other. And not to be tedious, let us say that the figures 
<A NAME="107"></A>and melodies which are expressive of virtue of soul or body, or of images 
<A NAME="108"></A>of virtue, are without exception good, and those which are expressive of 
<A NAME="109"></A>vice are the reverse of good.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Your suggestion is excellent; and let us answer that 
<A NAME="111"></A>these things are so.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Once more, are all of us equally delighted with every 
<A NAME="113"></A>sort of dance?
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Far otherwise.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> What, then, leads us astray? Are beautiful things not the 
<A NAME="116"></A>same to us all, or are they the same in themselves, but not in our opinion 
<A NAME="117"></A>of them? For no one will admit that forms of vice in the dance are more 
<A NAME="118"></A>beautiful than forms of virtue, or that he himself delights in the forms 
<A NAME="119"></A>of vice, and others in a muse of another character. And yet most persons 
<A NAME="120"></A>say, that the excellence of music is to give pleasure to our souls. But 
<A NAME="121"></A>this is intolerable and blasphemous; there is, however, a much more plausible 
<A NAME="122"></A>account of the delusion.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What?
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The adaptation of art to the characters of men. Choric 
<A NAME="125"></A>movements are imitations of manners occurring in various actions, fortunes, 
<A NAME="126"></A>dispositions-each particular is imitated, and those to whom the words, 
<A NAME="127"></A>or songs, or dances are suited, either by nature or habit or both, cannot 
<A NAME="128"></A>help feeling pleasure in them and applauding them, and calling them beautiful. 
<A NAME="129"></A>But those whose natures, or ways, or habits are unsuited to them, cannot 
<A NAME="130"></A>delight in them or applaud them, and they call them base. There are others, 
<A NAME="131"></A>again, whose natures are right and their habits wrong, or whose habits 
<A NAME="132"></A>are right and their natures wrong, and they praise one thing, but are pleased 
<A NAME="133"></A>at another. For they say that all these imitations are pleasant, but not 
<A NAME="134"></A>good. And in the presence of those whom they think wise, they are ashamed 
<A NAME="135"></A>of dancing and singing in the baser manner, or of deliberately lending 
<A NAME="136"></A>any countenance to such proceedings; and yet, they have a secret pleasure 
<A NAME="137"></A>in them.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And is any harm done to the lover of vicious dances or 
<A NAME="140"></A>songs, or any good done to the approver of the opposite sort of 
<A NAME="141"></A>pleasure?
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I think that there is.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Ath. "I think" is not the word, but I would say, rather, "I am certain." 
<A NAME="144"></A>For must they not have the same effect as when a man associates with bad 
<A NAME="145"></A>characters, whom he likes and approves rather than dislikes, and only censures 
<A NAME="146"></A>playfully because he has a suspicion of his own badness? In that case, 
<A NAME="147"></A>he who takes pleasure in them will surely become like those in whom he 
<A NAME="148"></A>takes pleasure, even though he be ashamed to praise them. And what greater 
<A NAME="149"></A>good or evil can any destiny ever make us undergo?
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I know of none.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then in a city which has good laws, or in future ages is 
<A NAME="152"></A>to have them, bearing in mind the instruction and amusement which are given 
<A NAME="153"></A>by music, can we suppose that the poets are to be allowed to teach in the 
<A NAME="154"></A>dance anything which they themselves like, in the way of rhythm, or melody, 
<A NAME="155"></A>or words, to the young children of any well-conditioned parents? Is the 
<A NAME="156"></A>poet to train his choruses as he pleases, without reference to virtue or 
<A NAME="157"></A>vice?
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That is surely quite unreasonable, and is not to be 
<A NAME="159"></A>thought of.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And yet he may do this in almost any state with the exception 
<A NAME="161"></A>of Egypt.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> And what are the laws about music and dancing in 
<A NAME="163"></A>Egypt?
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> You will wonder when I tell you: Long ago they appear to 
<A NAME="165"></A>have recognized the very principle of which we are now speaking-that their 
<A NAME="166"></A>young citizens must be habituated to forms and strains of virtue. These 
<A NAME="167"></A>they fixed, and exhibited the patterns of them in their temples; and no 
<A NAME="168"></A>painter or artist is allowed to innovate upon them, or to leave the traditional 
<A NAME="169"></A>forms and invent new ones. To this day, no alteration is allowed either 
<A NAME="170"></A>in these arts, or in music at all. And you will find that their works of 
<A NAME="171"></A>art are painted or moulded in the same forms which they had ten thousand 
<A NAME="172"></A>years ago;-this is literally true and no exaggeration-their ancient paintings 
<A NAME="173"></A>and sculptures are not a whit better or worse than the work of to-day, 
<A NAME="174"></A>but are made with just the same skill.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How extraordinary!
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I should rather say, How statesmanlike, how worthy of a 
<A NAME="177"></A>legislator! I know that other things in Egypt are nat so well. But what 
<A NAME="178"></A>I am telling you about music is true and deserving of consideration, because 
<A NAME="179"></A>showing that a lawgiver may institute melodies which have a natural truth 
<A NAME="180"></A>and correctness without any fear of failure. To do this, however, must 
<A NAME="181"></A>be the work of God, or of a divine person; in Egypt they have a tradition 
<A NAME="182"></A>that their ancient chants which have been preserved for so many ages are 
<A NAME="183"></A>the composition of the Goddess Isis. And therefore, as I was saying, if 
<A NAME="184"></A>a person can only find in any way the natural melodies, he may confidently 
<A NAME="185"></A>embody them in a fixed and legal form. For the love of novelty which arises 
<A NAME="186"></A>out of pleasure in the new and weariness of the old, has not strength enough 
<A NAME="187"></A>to corrupt the consecrated song and dance, under the plea that they have 
<A NAME="188"></A>become antiquated. At any rate, they are far from being corrupted in 
<A NAME="189"></A>Egypt.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Your arguments seem to prove your 
<A NAME="191"></A>point.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> May we not confidently say that the true use of music and 
<A NAME="193"></A>of choral festivities is as follows: We rejoice when we think that we prosper, 
<A NAME="194"></A>and again we think that we prosper when we rejoice?
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Exactly.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And when rejoicing in our good fortune, we are unable to 
<A NAME="197"></A>be still?
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Our young men break forth into dancing and singing, and 
<A NAME="200"></A>we who are their elders deem that we are fulfilling our part in life when 
<A NAME="201"></A>we look on at them. Having lost our agility, we delight in their sports 
<A NAME="202"></A>and merry-making, because we love to think of our former selves; and gladly 
<A NAME="203"></A>institute contests for those who are able to awaken in us the memory of 
<A NAME="204"></A>our youth.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Is it altogether unmeaning to say, as the common people 
<A NAME="207"></A>do about festivals, that he should be adjudged the wisest of men, and the 
<A NAME="208"></A>winner of the palm, who gives us the greatest amount of pleasure and mirth? 
<A NAME="209"></A>For on such occasions, and when mirth is the order of the day, ought not 
<A NAME="210"></A>he to be honoured most, and, as I was saying, bear the palm, who gives 
<A NAME="211"></A>most mirth to the greatest number? Now is this a true way of speaking or 
<A NAME="212"></A>of acting?
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Possibly.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But, my dear friend, let us distinguish between different 
<A NAME="215"></A>cases, and not be hasty in forming a judgment: One way of considering the 
<A NAME="216"></A>question will be to imagine a festival at which there are entertainments 
<A NAME="217"></A>of all sorts, including gymnastic, musical, and equestrian contests: the 
<A NAME="218"></A>citizens are assembled; prizes are offered, and proclamation is made that 
<A NAME="219"></A>any one who likes may enter the lists, and that he is to bear the palm 
<A NAME="220"></A>who gives the most pleasure to the spectators-there is to be no regulation 
<A NAME="221"></A>about the manner how; but he who is most successful in giving pleasure 
<A NAME="222"></A>is to be crowned victor, and deemed to be the pleasantest of the candidates: 
<A NAME="223"></A>What is likely to be the result of such a proclamation?
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> In what respect?
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> There would be various exhibitions: one man, like Homer, 
<A NAME="226"></A>will exhibit a rhapsody, another a performance on the lute; one will have 
<A NAME="227"></A>a tragedy, and another a comedy. Nor would there be anything astonishing 
<A NAME="228"></A>in some one imagining that he could gain the prize by exhibiting a puppet-show. 
<A NAME="229"></A>Suppose these competitors to meet, and not these only, but innumerable 
<A NAME="230"></A>others as well can you tell me who ought to be the victor?
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I do not see how any one can answer you, or pretend 
<A NAME="232"></A>to know, unless he has heard with his own ears the several competitors; 
<A NAME="233"></A>the question is absurd.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Well, then, if neither of you can answer, shall I answer 
<A NAME="235"></A>this question which you deem so absurd?
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> If very small children are to determine the question, they 
<A NAME="238"></A>will decide for the puppet show.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The older children will be advocates of comedy; educated 
<A NAME="241"></A>women, and young men, and people in general, will favour 
<A NAME="242"></A>tragedy.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very likely.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And I believe that we old men would have the greatest pleasure 
<A NAME="245"></A>in hearing a rhapsodist recite well the Iliad and Odyssey, or one of the 
<A NAME="246"></A>Hesiodic poems, and would award the victory to him. But, who would really 
<A NAME="247"></A>be the victor?-that is the question.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Clearly you and I will have to declare that those whom 
<A NAME="250"></A>we old men adjudge victors ought to win; for our ways are far and away 
<A NAME="251"></A>better than any which at present exist anywhere in the 
<A NAME="252"></A>world.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Thus far I too should agree with the many, that the excellence 
<A NAME="255"></A>of music is to be measured by pleasure. But the pleasure must not be that 
<A NAME="256"></A>of chance persons; the fairest music is that which delights the best and 
<A NAME="257"></A>best educated, and especially that which delights the one man who is pre-eminent 
<A NAME="258"></A>in virtue and education. And therefore the judges must be men of character, 
<A NAME="259"></A>for they will require both wisdom and courage; the true judge must not 
<A NAME="260"></A>draw his inspiration from the theatre, nor ought he to be unnerved by the 
<A NAME="261"></A>clamour of the many and his own incapacity; nor again, knowing the truth, 
<A NAME="262"></A>ought he through cowardice and unmanliness carelessly to deliver a lying 
<A NAME="263"></A>judgment, with the very same lips which have just appealed to the Gods 
<A NAME="264"></A>before he judged. He is sitting not as the disciple of the theatre, but, 
<A NAME="265"></A>in his proper place, as their instructor, and he ought to be the enemy 
<A NAME="266"></A>of all pandering to the pleasure of the spectators. The ancient and common 
<A NAME="267"></A>custom of Hellas, which still prevails in Italy and Sicily, did certainly 
<A NAME="268"></A>leave the judgment to the body of spectators, who determined the victor 
<A NAME="269"></A>by show of hands. But this custom has been the destruction of the poets; 
<A NAME="270"></A>for they are now in the habit of composing with a view to please the bad 
<A NAME="271"></A>taste of their judges, and the result is that the spectators instruct themselves;-and 
<A NAME="272"></A>also it has been the ruin of the theatre; they ought to be having characters 
<A NAME="273"></A>put before them better than their own, and so receiving a higher pleasure, 
<A NAME="274"></A>but now by their own act the opposite result follows. What inference is 
<A NAME="275"></A>to be drawn from all this? Shall I tell you?
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What?
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The inference at which we arrive for the third or fourth 
<A NAME="278"></A>time is, that education is the constraining and directing of youth towards 
<A NAME="279"></A>that right reason, which the law affirms, and which the experience of the 
<A NAME="280"></A>eldest and best has agreed to be truly right. In order, then, that the 
<A NAME="281"></A>soul of the child may not be habituated to feel joy and sorrow in a manner 
<A NAME="282"></A>at variance with the law, and those who obey the law, but may rather follow 
<A NAME="283"></A>the law and rejoice and sorrow at the same things as the aged-in order, 
<A NAME="284"></A>I say, to produce this effect, chants appear to have been invented, which 
<A NAME="285"></A>really enchant, and are designed to implant that harmony of which we speak. 
<A NAME="286"></A>And, because the mind of the child is incapable of enduring serious training, 
<A NAME="287"></A>they are called plays and songs, and are performed in play; just as when 
<A NAME="288"></A>men are sick and ailing in their bodies, their attendants give them wholesome 
<A NAME="289"></A>diet in pleasant meats and drinks, but unwholesome diet in disagreeable 
<A NAME="290"></A>things, in order that they may learn, as they ought, to like the one, and 
<A NAME="291"></A>to dislike the other. And similarly the true legislator will persuade, 
<A NAME="292"></A>and, if he cannot persuade, will compel the poet to express, as he ought, 
<A NAME="293"></A>by fair and noble words, in his rhythms, the figures, and in his melodies, 
<A NAME="294"></A>the music of temperate and brave and in every way good 
<A NAME="295"></A>men.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> But do you really imagine, Stranger, that this is the 
<A NAME="297"></A>way in which poets generally compose in States at the present day? As far 
<A NAME="298"></A>as I can observe, except among us and among the Lacedaemonians, there are 
<A NAME="299"></A>no regulations like those of which you speak; in other places novelties 
<A NAME="300"></A>are always being introduced in dancing and in music, generally not under 
<A NAME="301"></A>the authority of any law, but at the instigation of lawless pleasures; 
<A NAME="302"></A>and these pleasures are so far from being the same, as you describe the 
<A NAME="303"></A>Egyptian to be, or having the same principles, that they are never the 
<A NAME="304"></A>same.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Most true, Cleinias; and I daresay that I may have 
<A NAME="306"></A>expressed myself obscurely, and so led you to imagine that I was speaking 
<A NAME="307"></A>of some really existing state of things, whereas I was only saying what 
<A NAME="308"></A>regulations I would like to have about music; and hence there occurred 
<A NAME="309"></A>a misapprehension on your part. For when evils are far gone and irremediable, 
<A NAME="310"></A>the task of censuring them is never pleasant, although at times necessary. 
<A NAME="311"></A>But as we do not really differ, will you let me ask you whether you consider 
<A NAME="312"></A>such institutions to be more prevalent among the Cretans and Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="313"></A>than among the other Hellenes?
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly they are.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And if they were extended to the other Hellenes, would 
<A NAME="316"></A>it be an improvement on the present state of things?
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> A very great improvement, if the customs which prevail 
<A NAME="318"></A>among them were such as prevail among us and the Lacedaemonians, and such 
<A NAME="319"></A>as you were just now saying ought to prevail.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us see whether we understand one another:-Are not 
<A NAME="321"></A>the principles of education and music which prevail among you as follows: 
<A NAME="322"></A>you compel your poets to say that the good man, if he be temperate and 
<A NAME="323"></A>just, is fortunate and happy; and this whether he be great and strong or 
<A NAME="324"></A>small and weak, and whether he be rich or poor; and, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="325"></A>if he have a wealth passing that of Cinyras or Midas, and be unjust, he 
<A NAME="326"></A>is wretched and lives in misery? As the poet says, and with truth: I sing 
<A NAME="327"></A>not, I care not about him who accomplishes all noble things, not having 
<A NAME="328"></A>justice; let him who "draws near and stretches out his hand against his 
<A NAME="329"></A>enemies be a just man." But if he be unjust, I would not have him "look 
<A NAME="330"></A>calmly upon bloody death," nor "surpass in swiftness the Thracian Boreas"; 
<A NAME="331"></A>and let no other thing that is called good ever be his. For the goods of 
<A NAME="332"></A>which the many speak are not really good: first in the catalogue is placed 
<A NAME="333"></A>health, beauty next, wealth third; and then innumerable others, as for 
<A NAME="334"></A>example to have a keen eye or a quick ear, and in general to have all the 
<A NAME="335"></A>senses perfect; or, again, to be a tyrant and do as you like; and the final 
<A NAME="336"></A>consummation of happiness is to have acquired all these things, and when 
<A NAME="337"></A>you have acquired them to become at once immortal. But you and I say, that 
<A NAME="338"></A>while to the just and holy all these things are the best of possessions, 
<A NAME="339"></A>to the unjust they are all, including even health, the greatest of evils. 
<A NAME="340"></A>For in truth, to have sight, and hearing, and the use of the senses, or 
<A NAME="341"></A>to live at all without justice and virtue, even though a man be rich in 
<A NAME="342"></A>all the so-called goods of fortune, is the greatest of evils, if life be 
<A NAME="343"></A>immortal; but not so great, if the bad man lives only a very short time. 
<A NAME="344"></A>These are the truths which, if I am not mistaken, you will persuade or 
<A NAME="345"></A>compel your poets to utter with suitable accompaniments of harmony and 
<A NAME="346"></A>rhythm, and in these they must train up your youth. Am I not right? For 
<A NAME="347"></A>I plainly declare that evils as they are termed are goods to the unjust, 
<A NAME="348"></A>and only evils to the just, and that goods are truly good to the good, 
<A NAME="349"></A>but evil to the evil. Let me ask again, Are you and I agreed about 
<A NAME="350"></A>this?
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I think that we partly agree and partly do 
<A NAME="352"></A>not.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> When a man has health and wealth and a tyranny which lasts, 
<A NAME="354"></A>and when he is preeminent in strength and courage, and has the gift of 
<A NAME="355"></A>immortality, and none of the so-called evils which counter-balance these 
<A NAME="356"></A>goods, but only the injustice and insolence of his own nature-of such an 
<A NAME="357"></A>one you are, I suspect, unwilling to believe that he is miserable rather 
<A NAME="358"></A>than happy.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That is quite true.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Once more: Suppose that he be valiant and strong, and handsome 
<A NAME="361"></A>and rich, and does throughout his whole life whatever he likes, still, 
<A NAME="362"></A>if he be unrighteous and insolent, would not both of you agree that he 
<A NAME="363"></A>will of necessity live basely? You will surely grant so 
<A NAME="364"></A>much?
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And an evil life too?
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> I am not equally disposed to grant that.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Will he not live painfully and to his own 
<A NAME="369"></A>disadvantage?
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> How can I possibly say so?
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> How! Then may Heaven make us to be of one mind, for now 
<A NAME="372"></A>we are of two. To me, dear Cleinias, the truth of what I am saying is as 
<A NAME="373"></A>plain as the fact that Crete is an island. And, if I were a lawgiver, I 
<A NAME="374"></A>would try to make the poets and all the citizens speak in this strain, 
<A NAME="375"></A>and I would inflict the heaviest penalties on any one in all the land who 
<A NAME="376"></A>should dare to say that there are bad men who lead pleasant lives, or that 
<A NAME="377"></A>the profitable and gainful is one thing, and the just another; and there 
<A NAME="378"></A>are many other matters about which I should make my citizens speak in a 
<A NAME="379"></A>manner different from the Cretans and Lacedaemonians of this age, and I 
<A NAME="380"></A>may say, indeed, from the world in general. For tell me, my good friends, 
<A NAME="381"></A>by Zeus and Apollo tell me, if I were to ask these same Gods who were your 
<A NAME="382"></A>legislators-Is not the most just life also the pleasantest? or are there 
<A NAME="383"></A>two lives, one of which is the justest and the other the pleasantest?-and 
<A NAME="384"></A>they were to reply that there are two; and thereupon I proceeded to ask, 
<A NAME="385"></A>(that would be the right way of pursuing the enquiry), Which are the happier-those 
<A NAME="386"></A>who lead the justest, or those who lead the pleasantest life? and they 
<A NAME="387"></A>replied, Those who lead the pleasantest-that would be a very strange answer, 
<A NAME="388"></A>which I should not like to put into the mouth of the Gods. The words will 
<A NAME="389"></A>come with more propriety from the lips of fathers and legislators, and 
<A NAME="390"></A>therefore I will repeat my former questions to one of them, and suppose 
<A NAME="391"></A>him to say again that he who leads the pleasantest life is the happiest. 
<A NAME="392"></A>And to that I rejoin:-O my father, did you not wish me to live as happily 
<A NAME="393"></A>as possible? And yet you also never ceased telling me that I should live 
<A NAME="394"></A>as justly as possible. Now, here the giver of the rule, whether he be legislator 
<A NAME="395"></A>or father, will be in a dilemma, and will in vain endeavour to be consistent 
<A NAME="396"></A>with himself. But if he were to declare that the justest life is also the 
<A NAME="397"></A>happiest, every one hearing him would enquire, if I am not mistaken, what 
<A NAME="398"></A>is that good and noble principle in life which the law approves, and which 
<A NAME="399"></A>is superior to pleasure. For what good can the just man have which is separated 
<A NAME="400"></A>from pleasure? Shall we say that glory and fame, coming from Gods and men, 
<A NAME="401"></A>though good and noble, are nevertheless unpleasant, and infamy pleasant? 
<A NAME="402"></A>Certainly not, sweet legislator. Or shall we say that the not-doing of 
<A NAME="403"></A>wrong and there being no wrong done is good and honourable, although there 
<A NAME="404"></A>is no pleasure in it, and that the doing wrong is pleasant, but evil and 
<A NAME="405"></A>base?
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Impossible.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The view which identifies the pleasant and the pleasant 
<A NAME="408"></A>and the just and the good and the noble has an excellent moral and religious 
<A NAME="409"></A>tendency. And the opposite view is most at variance with the designs of 
<A NAME="410"></A>the legislator, and is, in his opinion, infamous; for no one, if he can 
<A NAME="411"></A>help, will be persuaded to do that which gives him more pain than pleasure. 
<A NAME="412"></A>But as distant prospects are apt to make us dizzy, especially in childhood, 
<A NAME="413"></A>the legislator will try to purge away the darkness and exhibit the truth; 
<A NAME="414"></A>he will persuade the citizens, in some way or other, by customs and praises 
<A NAME="415"></A>and words, that just and unjust are shadows only, and that injustice, which 
<A NAME="416"></A>seems opposed to justice, when contemplated by the unjust and evil man 
<A NAME="417"></A>appears pleasant and the just most unpleasant; but that from the just man's 
<A NAME="418"></A>point of view, the very opposite is the appearance of both of 
<A NAME="419"></A>them.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And which may be supposed to be the truer judgment-that 
<A NAME="422"></A>of the inferior or of the better soul?
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Surely, that of the better soul.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then the unjust life must not only be more base and depraved, 
<A NAME="425"></A>but also more unpleasant than the just and holy life?
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That seems to be implied in the present 
<A NAME="427"></A>argument.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And even supposing this were otherwise, and not as the 
<A NAME="429"></A>argument has proven, still the lawgiver, who is worth anything, if he ever 
<A NAME="430"></A>ventures to tell a lie to the young for their good, could not invent a 
<A NAME="431"></A>more useful lie than this, or one which will have a better effect in making 
<A NAME="432"></A>them do what is right, not on compulsion but voluntarily.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Truth, Stranger, is a noble thing and a lasting, but 
<A NAME="434"></A>a thing of which men are hard to be persuaded.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> And yet the story of the Sidonian Cadmus, which is 
<A NAME="436"></A>so improbable, has been readily believed, and also innumerable other 
<A NAME="437"></A>tales.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What is that story?
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The story of armed men springing up after the sowing of 
<A NAME="440"></A>teeth, which the legislator may take as a proof that he can persuade the 
<A NAME="441"></A>minds of the young of anything; so that he has only to reflect and find 
<A NAME="442"></A>out what belief will be of the greatest public advantage, and then use 
<A NAME="443"></A>all his efforts to make the whole community utter one and the same word 
<A NAME="444"></A>in their songs and tales and discourses all their life long. But if you 
<A NAME="445"></A>do not agree with me, there is no reason why you should not argue on the 
<A NAME="446"></A>other side.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I do not see that any argument can fairly be raised 
<A NAME="448"></A>by either of us against what you are now saying.
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> The next suggestion which I have to offer is, that 
<A NAME="450"></A>all our three choruses shall sing to the young and tender souls of children, 
<A NAME="451"></A>reciting in their strains all the noble thoughts of which we have already 
<A NAME="452"></A>spoken, or are about to speak; and the sum of them shall be, that the life 
<A NAME="453"></A>which is by the Gods deemed to be the happiest is also the best;-we shall 
<A NAME="454"></A>affirm this to be a most certain truth; and the minds of our young disciples 
<A NAME="455"></A>will be more likely to receive these words of ours than any others which 
<A NAME="456"></A>we might address to them.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I assent to what you say.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> First will enter in their natural order the sacred choir 
<A NAME="459"></A>composed of children, which is to sing lustily the heaven-taught lay to 
<A NAME="460"></A>the whole city. Next will follow the choir of young men under the age of 
<A NAME="461"></A>thirty, who will call upon the God Paean to testify to the truth of their 
<A NAME="462"></A>words, and will pray him to be gracious to the youth and to turn their 
<A NAME="463"></A>hearts. Thirdly, the choir of elder men, who are from thirty to sixty years 
<A NAME="464"></A>of age, will also sing. There remain those who are too old to sing, and 
<A NAME="465"></A>they will tell stories, illustrating the same virtues, as with the voice 
<A NAME="466"></A>of an oracle.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Who are those who compose the third choir, Stranger? 
<A NAME="468"></A>for I do not clearly understand what you mean to say about 
<A NAME="469"></A>them.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> And yet almost all that I have been saying has said 
<A NAME="471"></A>with a view to them.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Will you try to be a little plainer?
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I was speaking at the commencement of our discourse, as 
<A NAME="474"></A>you will remember, of the fiery nature of young creatures: I said that 
<A NAME="475"></A>they were unable to keep quiet either in limb or voice, and that they called 
<A NAME="476"></A>out and jumped about in a disorderly manner; and that no other animal attained 
<A NAME="477"></A>to any perception of order, but man only. Now the order of motion is called 
<A NAME="478"></A>rhythm, and the order of the voice, in which high and low are duly mingled, 
<A NAME="479"></A>is called harmony; and both together are termed choric song. And I said 
<A NAME="480"></A>that the Gods had pity on us, and gave us Apollo and the Muses to be our 
<A NAME="481"></A>playfellows and leaders in the dance; and Dionysus, as I dare say that 
<A NAME="482"></A>you will remember, was the third.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I quite remember.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Thus far I have spoken of the chorus of Apollo and the 
<A NAME="485"></A>Muses, and I have still to speak of the remaining chorus, which is that 
<A NAME="486"></A>of Dionysus.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How is that arranged? There is something strange, at 
<A NAME="488"></A>any rate on first hearing, in a Dionysiac chorus of old men, if you really 
<A NAME="489"></A>mean that those who are above thirty, and may be fifty, or from fifty to 
<A NAME="490"></A>sixty years of age, are to dance in his honour.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Very true; and therefore it must be shown that there 
<A NAME="492"></A>is good reason for the proposal.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Are we agreed thus far?
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> About what?
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> That every man and boy, slave and free, both sexes, and 
<A NAME="497"></A>the whole city, should never cease charming themselves with the strains 
<A NAME="498"></A>of which we have spoken; and that there should be every sort of change 
<A NAME="499"></A>and variation of them in order to take away the effect of sameness, so 
<A NAME="500"></A>that the singers may always receive pleasure from their hymns, and may 
<A NAME="501"></A>never weary of them?
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Every one will agree.
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Where, then, will that best part of our city which, by 
<A NAME="504"></A>reason of age and intelligence, has the greatest influence, sing these 
<A NAME="505"></A>fairest of strains, which are to do so much good? Shall we be so foolish 
<A NAME="506"></A>as to let them off who would give us the most beautiful and also the most 
<A NAME="507"></A>useful of songs?
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> But, says the argument, we cannot let them 
<A NAME="509"></A>off.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then how can we carry out our purpose with decorum? Will 
<A NAME="511"></A>this be the way?
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What?
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> When a man is advancing in years, he is afraid and reluctant 
<A NAME="514"></A>to sing;-he has no pleasure in his own performances; and if compulsion 
<A NAME="515"></A>is used, he will be more and more ashamed, the older and more discreet 
<A NAME="516"></A>he grows;-is not this true?
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Well, and will he not be yet more ashamed if he has to 
<A NAME="519"></A>stand up and sing in the theatre to a mixed audience?-and if moreover when 
<A NAME="520"></A>he is required to do so, like the other choirs who contend for prizes, 
<A NAME="521"></A>and have been trained under a singing master, he is pinched and hungry, 
<A NAME="522"></A>he will certainly have a feeling of shame and discomfort which will make 
<A NAME="523"></A>him very unwilling to exhibit.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> No doubt.
<A NAME="525"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> How, then, shall we reassure him, and get him to sing? 
<A NAME="526"></A>Shall we begin by enacting that boys shall not taste wine at all until 
<A NAME="527"></A>they are eighteen years of age; we will tell them that fire must not be 
<A NAME="528"></A>poured upon fire, whether in the body or in the soul, until they begin 
<A NAME="529"></A>to go to work-this is a precaution which has to be taken against the excitableness 
<A NAME="530"></A>of youth;-afterwards they may taste wine in moderation up to the age of 
<A NAME="531"></A>thirty, but while a man is young he should abstain altogether from intoxication 
<A NAME="532"></A>and from excess of wine; when, at length, he has reached forty years, after 
<A NAME="533"></A>dinner at a public mess, he may invite not only the other Gods, but Dionysus 
<A NAME="534"></A>above all, to the mystery and festivity of the elder men, making use of 
<A NAME="535"></A>the wine which he has given men to lighten the sourness of old age; that 
<A NAME="536"></A>in age we may renew our youth, and forget our sorrows; and also in order 
<A NAME="537"></A>that the nature of the soul, like iron melted in the fire, may become softer 
<A NAME="538"></A>and so more impressible. In the first place, will not any one who is thus 
<A NAME="539"></A>mellowed be more ready and less ashamed to sing-I do not say before a large 
<A NAME="540"></A>audience, but before a moderate company; nor yet among strangers, but among 
<A NAME="541"></A>his familiars, and, as we have often said, to chant, and to 
<A NAME="542"></A>enchant?
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> He will be far more ready.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> There will be no impropriety in our using such a method 
<A NAME="545"></A>of persuading them to join with us in song.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> None at all.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And what strain will they sing, and what muse will they 
<A NAME="548"></A>hymn? The strain should clearly be one suitable to them.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And what strain is suitable for heroes? Shall they sing 
<A NAME="551"></A>a choric strain?
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Truly, Stranger, we of Crete and Lacedaemon know no 
<A NAME="553"></A>strain other than that which we have learnt and been accustomed to sing 
<A NAME="554"></A>in our chorus.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> I dare say; for you have never acquired the knowledge 
<A NAME="556"></A>of the most beautiful kind of song, in your military way of life, which 
<A NAME="557"></A>is modelled after the camp, and is not like that of dwellers in cities; 
<A NAME="558"></A>and you have your young men herding and feeding together like young colts. 
<A NAME="559"></A>No one takes his own individual colt and drags him away from his fellows 
<A NAME="560"></A>against his will, raging and foaming, and gives him a groom to attend to 
<A NAME="561"></A>him alone, and trains and rubs him down privately, and gives him the qualities 
<A NAME="562"></A>in education which will make him not only a good soldier, but also a governor 
<A NAME="563"></A>of a state and of cities. Such an one, as we said at first, would be a 
<A NAME="564"></A>greater warrior than he of whom Tyrtaeus sings; and he would honour courage 
<A NAME="565"></A>everywhere, but always as the fourth, and not as the first part of virtue, 
<A NAME="566"></A>either in individuals or states.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Once more, Stranger, I must complain that you depreciate 
<A NAME="568"></A>our lawgivers.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Not intentionally, if at all, my good friend; but whither 
<A NAME="570"></A>the argument leads, thither let us follow; for if there be indeed some 
<A NAME="571"></A>strain of song more beautiful than that of the choruses or the public theatres, 
<A NAME="572"></A>I should like to impart it to those who, as we say, are ashamed of these, 
<A NAME="573"></A>and want to have the best.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> When things have an accompanying charm, either the best 
<A NAME="576"></A>thing in them is this very charm, or there is some rightness or utility 
<A NAME="577"></A>possessed by them;-for example, I should say that eating and drinking, 
<A NAME="578"></A>and the use of food in general, have an accompanying charm which we call 
<A NAME="579"></A>pleasure; but that this rightness and utility is just the healthfulness 
<A NAME="580"></A>of the things served up to us, which is their true rightness.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Just so.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Thus, too, I should say that learning has a certain accompanying 
<A NAME="583"></A>charm which is the pleasure; but that the right and the profitable, the 
<A NAME="584"></A>good and the noble, are qualities which the truth gives to 
<A NAME="585"></A>it.
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Exactly.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And so in the imitative arts-if they succeed in making 
<A NAME="588"></A>likenesses, and are accompanied by pleasure, may not their works be said 
<A NAME="589"></A>to have a charm?
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But equal proportions, whether of quality or quantity, 
<A NAME="592"></A>and not pleasure, speaking generally, would give them truth or 
<A NAME="593"></A>rightness.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then that only can be rightly judged by the standard of 
<A NAME="596"></A>pleasure, which makes or furnishes no utility or truth or likeness, nor 
<A NAME="597"></A>on the other hand is productive of any hurtful quality, but exists solely 
<A NAME="598"></A>for the sake of the accompanying charm; and the term "pleasure" is most 
<A NAME="599"></A>appropriately applied to it when these other qualities are 
<A NAME="600"></A>absent.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> You are speaking of harmless pleasure, are you 
<A NAME="602"></A>not?
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes; and this I term amusement, when doing neither harm 
<A NAME="604"></A>nor good in any degree worth speaking of.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then, if such be our principles, we must assert that imitation 
<A NAME="607"></A>is not to be judged of by pleasure and false opinion; and this is true 
<A NAME="608"></A>of all equality, for the equal is not equal or the symmetrical symmetrical, 
<A NAME="609"></A>because somebody thinks or likes something, but they are to be judged of 
<A NAME="610"></A>by the standard of truth, and by no other whatever.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Do we not regard all music as representative and 
<A NAME="613"></A>imitative?
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then, when any one says that music is to be judged of by 
<A NAME="616"></A>pleasure, his doctrine cannot be admitted; and if there be any music of 
<A NAME="617"></A>which pleasure is the criterion, such music is not to be sought out or 
<A NAME="618"></A>deemed to have any real excellence, but only that other kind of music which 
<A NAME="619"></A>is an imitation of the good.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And those who seek for the best kind of song and music 
<A NAME="622"></A>ought not to seek for that which is pleasant, but for that which is true; 
<A NAME="623"></A>and the truth of imitation consists, as we were saying, in rendering the 
<A NAME="624"></A>thing imitated according to quantity and quality.
<A NAME="625"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And every one will admit that musical compositions are 
<A NAME="627"></A>all imitative and representative. Will not poets and spectators and actors 
<A NAME="628"></A>all agree in this?
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> They will.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Surely then he who would judge correctly must know what 
<A NAME="631"></A>each composition is; for if he does not know what is the character and 
<A NAME="632"></A>meaning of the piece, and what it represents, he will never discern whether 
<A NAME="633"></A>the intention is true or false.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And will he who does not know what is true be able to distinguish 
<A NAME="636"></A>what is good and bad? My statement is not very clear; but perhaps you will 
<A NAME="637"></A>understand me better if I put the matter in another 
<A NAME="638"></A>way.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How?
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> There are ten thousand likenesses of objects of 
<A NAME="641"></A>sight?
<A NAME="642"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And can he who does not know what the exact object is which 
<A NAME="644"></A>is imitated, ever know whether the resemblance is truthfully executed? 
<A NAME="645"></A>I mean, for example, whether a statue has the proportions of a body, and 
<A NAME="646"></A>the true situation of the parts; what those proportions are, and how the 
<A NAME="647"></A>parts fit into one another in due order; also their colours and conformations, 
<A NAME="648"></A>or whether this is all confused in the execution: do you think that any 
<A NAME="649"></A>one can know about this, who does not know what the animal is which has 
<A NAME="650"></A>been imitated?
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Impossible.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But even if we know that the thing pictured or sculptured 
<A NAME="653"></A>is a man, who has received at the hand of the artist all his proper parts 
<A NAME="654"></A>and colours and shapes, must we not also know whether the work is beautiful 
<A NAME="655"></A>or in any respect deficient in beauty?
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> If this were not required, Stranger, we should all 
<A NAME="657"></A>of us be judges of beauty.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Very true; and may we not say that in everything imitated, 
<A NAME="659"></A>whether in drawing, music, or any other art, he who is to be a competent 
<A NAME="660"></A>judge must possess three things;-he must know, in the first place, of what 
<A NAME="661"></A>the imitation is; secondly, he must know that it is true; and thirdly, 
<A NAME="662"></A>that it has been well executed in words and melodies and 
<A NAME="663"></A>rhythms?
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then let us not faint in discussing the peculiar difficulty 
<A NAME="666"></A>of music. Music is more celebrated than any other kind of imitation, and 
<A NAME="667"></A>therefore requires the greatest care of them all. For if a man makes a 
<A NAME="668"></A>mistake here, he may do himself the greatest injury by welcoming evil dispositions, 
<A NAME="669"></A>and the mistake may be very difficult to discern, because the poets are 
<A NAME="670"></A>artists very inferior in character to the Muses themselves, who would never 
<A NAME="671"></A>fall into the monstrous error of assigning to the words of men the gestures 
<A NAME="672"></A>and songs of women; nor after combining the melodies with the gestures 
<A NAME="673"></A>of freemen would they add on the rhythms of slaves and men of the baser 
<A NAME="674"></A>sort; nor, beginning with the rhythms and gestures of freemen, would they 
<A NAME="675"></A>assign to them a melody or words which are of an opposite character; nor 
<A NAME="676"></A>would they mix up the voices and sounds of animals and of men and instruments, 
<A NAME="677"></A>and every other sort of noise, as if they were all one. But human poets 
<A NAME="678"></A>are fond of introducing this sort of inconsistent mixture, and so make 
<A NAME="679"></A>themselves ridiculous in the eyes of those who, as Orpheus says, "are ripe 
<A NAME="680"></A>for true pleasure." The experienced see all this confusion, and yet the 
<A NAME="681"></A>poets go on and make still further havoc by separating the rhythm and the 
<A NAME="682"></A>figure of the dance from the melody, setting bare words to metre, and also 
<A NAME="683"></A>separating the melody and the rhythm from the words, using the lyre or 
<A NAME="684"></A>the flute alone. For when there are no words, it is very difficult to recognize 
<A NAME="685"></A>the meaning of the harmony and rhythm, or to see that any worthy object 
<A NAME="686"></A>is imitated by them. And we must acknowledge that all this sort of thing, 
<A NAME="687"></A>which aims only at swiftness and smoothness and a brutish noise, and uses 
<A NAME="688"></A>the flute and the lyre not as the mere accompaniments of the dance and 
<A NAME="689"></A>song, is exceedingly coarse and tasteless. The use of either instrument, 
<A NAME="690"></A>when unaccompanied, leads to every sort of irregularity and trickery. This 
<A NAME="691"></A>is all rational enough. But we are considering not how our choristers, 
<A NAME="692"></A>who are from thirty to fifty years of age, and may be over fifty, are not 
<A NAME="693"></A>to use the Muses, but how they are to use them. And the considerations 
<A NAME="694"></A>which we have urged seem to show in what way these fifty year-old choristers 
<A NAME="695"></A>who are to sing, may be expected to be better trained. For they need to 
<A NAME="696"></A>have a quick perception and knowledge of harmonies and rhythms; otherwise, 
<A NAME="697"></A>how can they ever know whether a melody would be rightly sung to the Dorian 
<A NAME="698"></A>mode, or to the rhythm which the poet has assigned to 
<A NAME="699"></A>it?
<A NAME="700"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Clearly they cannot.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The many are ridiculous in imagining that they know what 
<A NAME="702"></A>is in proper harmony and rhythm, and what is not, when they can only be 
<A NAME="703"></A>made to sing and step in rhythm by force; it never occurs to them that 
<A NAME="704"></A>they are ignorant of what they are doing. Now every melody is right when 
<A NAME="705"></A>it has suitable harmony and rhythm, and wrong when unsuitable.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That is most certain.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But can a man who does not know a thing, as we were saying, 
<A NAME="708"></A>know that the thing is right?
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Impossible.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then now, as would appear, we are making the discovery 
<A NAME="711"></A>that our newly-appointed choristers, whom we hereby invite and, although 
<A NAME="712"></A>they are their own masters, compel to sing, must be educated to such an 
<A NAME="713"></A>extent as to be able to follow the steps of the rhythm and the notes of 
<A NAME="714"></A>the song, that they may know the harmonies and rhythms, and be able to 
<A NAME="715"></A>select what are suitable for men of their age and character to sing; and 
<A NAME="716"></A>may sing them, and have innocent pleasure from their own performance, and 
<A NAME="717"></A>also lead younger men to welcome with dutiful delight good dispositions. 
<A NAME="718"></A>Having such training, they will attain a more accurate knowledge than falls 
<A NAME="719"></A>to the lot of the common people, or even of the poets themselves. For the 
<A NAME="720"></A>poet need not know the third point, viz., whether the imitation is good 
<A NAME="721"></A>or not, though he can hardly help knowing the laws of melody and rhythm. 
<A NAME="722"></A>But the aged chorus must know all the three, that they may choose the best, 
<A NAME="723"></A>and that which is nearest to the best; for otherwise they will never be 
<A NAME="724"></A>able to charm the souls of young men in the way of virtue. And now the 
<A NAME="725"></A>original design of the argument which was intended to bring eloquent aid 
<A NAME="726"></A>to the Chorus of Dionysus, has been accomplished to the best of our ability, 
<A NAME="727"></A>and let us see whether we were right:-I should imagine that a drinking 
<A NAME="728"></A>assembly is likely to become more and more tumultuous as the drinking goes 
<A NAME="729"></A>on: this, as we were saying at first, will certainly be the 
<A NAME="730"></A>case.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Every man has a more than natural elevation; his heart 
<A NAME="733"></A>is glad within him, and he will say anything and will be restrained by 
<A NAME="734"></A>nobody at such a time; he fancies that he is able to rule over himself 
<A NAME="735"></A>and all mankind.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Were we not saying that on such occasions the souls of 
<A NAME="738"></A>the drinkers become like iron heated in the fire, and grow softer and younger, 
<A NAME="739"></A>and are easily moulded by him who knows how to educate and fashion them, 
<A NAME="740"></A>just as when they were young, and that this fashioner of them is the same 
<A NAME="741"></A>who prescribed for them in the days of their youth, viz., the good legislator; 
<A NAME="742"></A>and that he ought to enact laws of the banquet, which, when a man is confident, 
<A NAME="743"></A>bold, and impudent, and unwilling to wait his turn and have his share of 
<A NAME="744"></A>silence and speech, and drinking and music, will change his character into 
<A NAME="745"></A>the opposite-such laws as will infuse into him a just and noble fear, which 
<A NAME="746"></A>will take up arms at the approach of insolence, being that divine fear 
<A NAME="747"></A>which we have called reverence and shame?
<A NAME="748"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And the guardians of these laws and fellow-workers with 
<A NAME="750"></A>them are the calm and sober generals of the drinkers; and without their 
<A NAME="751"></A>help there is greater difficulty in fighting against drink than in fighting 
<A NAME="752"></A>against enemies when the commander of an army is not himself calm; and 
<A NAME="753"></A>he who is unwilling to obey them and the commanders of Dionysiac feasts 
<A NAME="754"></A>who are more than sixty years of age, shall suffer a disgrace as great 
<A NAME="755"></A>as he who disobeys military leaders, or even greater.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Right.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> If, then, drinking and amusement were regulated in this 
<A NAME="758"></A>way, would not the companions of our revels be improved? they would part 
<A NAME="759"></A>better friends than they were, and not, as now enemies. Their whole intercourse 
<A NAME="760"></A>would be regulated by law and observant of it, and the sober would be the 
<A NAME="761"></A>leaders of the drunken.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I think so too, if drinking were regulated as you 
<A NAME="763"></A>propose.
<A NAME="764"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us not then simply censure the gift of Dionysus as 
<A NAME="765"></A>bad and unfit to be received into the State. For wine has many excellences, 
<A NAME="766"></A>and one pre-eminent one, about which there is a difficulty in speaking 
<A NAME="767"></A>to the many, from a fear of their misconceiving and misunderstanding what 
<A NAME="768"></A>is said.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To what do you refer?
<A NAME="770"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> There is a tradition or story, which has somehow crept 
<A NAME="771"></A>about the world, that Dionysus was robbed of his wits by his stepmother 
<A NAME="772"></A>Here, and that out of revenge he inspires Bacchic furies and dancing madnesses 
<A NAME="773"></A>in others; for which reason he gave men wine. Such traditions concerning 
<A NAME="774"></A>the Gods I leave to those who think that they may be safely uttered; I 
<A NAME="775"></A>only know that no animal at birth is mature or perfect in intelligence; 
<A NAME="776"></A>and in the intermediate period, in which he has not yet acquired his own 
<A NAME="777"></A>proper sense, he rages and roars without rhyme or reason; and when he has 
<A NAME="778"></A>once got on his legs he jumps about without rhyme or reason; and this, 
<A NAME="779"></A>as you will remember, has been already said by us to be the origin of music 
<A NAME="780"></A>and gymnastic.
<A NAME="781"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To be sure, I remember.
<A NAME="782"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And did we not say that the sense of harmony and rhythm 
<A NAME="783"></A>sprang from this beginning among men, and that Apollo and the Muses and 
<A NAME="784"></A>Dionysus were the Gods whom we had to thank for them?
<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The other story implied that wine was given man out of 
<A NAME="787"></A>revenge, and in order to make him mad; but our present doctrine, on the 
<A NAME="788"></A>contrary, is, that wine was given him as a balm, and in order to implant 
<A NAME="789"></A>modesty in the soul, and health and strength in the 
<A NAME="790"></A>body.
<A NAME="791"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That, Stranger, is precisely what was 
<A NAME="792"></A>said.
<A NAME="793"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then half the subject may now be considered to have been 
<A NAME="794"></A>discussed; shall we proceed to the consideration of the other 
<A NAME="795"></A>half?
<A NAME="796"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What is the other half, and how do you divide the 
<A NAME="797"></A>subject?
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The whole choral art is also in our view the whole of education; 
<A NAME="799"></A>and of this art, rhythms and harmonies form the part which has to do with 
<A NAME="800"></A>the voice.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The movement of the body has rhythm in common with the 
<A NAME="803"></A>movement of the voice, but gesture is peculiar to it, whereas song is simply 
<A NAME="804"></A>the movement of the voice.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And the sound of the voice which reaches and educates the 
<A NAME="807"></A>soul, we have ventured to term music.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> We were right.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And the movement of the body, when regarded as an amusement, 
<A NAME="810"></A>we termed dancing; but when extended and pursued with a view to the excellence 
<A NAME="811"></A>of the body, this scientific training may be called 
<A NAME="812"></A>gymnastic.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Exactly.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Music, which was one half of the choral art, may be said 
<A NAME="815"></A>to have been completely discussed. Shall we proceed to the other half or 
<A NAME="816"></A>not? What would you like?
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> My good friend, when you are talking with a Cretan 
<A NAME="818"></A>and Lacedaemonian, and we have discussed music and not gymnastic, what 
<A NAME="819"></A>answer are either of us likely to make to such an enquiry?
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> An answer is contained in your question; and I understand 
<A NAME="821"></A>and accept what you say not only as an answer, but also as a command to 
<A NAME="822"></A>proceed with gymnastic.
<A NAME="823"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> You quite understand me; do as you 
<A NAME="824"></A>say.
<A NAME="825"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I will; and there will not be any difficulty in speaking 
<A NAME="826"></A>intelligibly to you about a subject with which both of you are far more 
<A NAME="827"></A>familiar than with music.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> There will not.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Is not the origin of gymnastics, too, to be sought in the 
<A NAME="830"></A>tendency to rapid motion which exists in all animals; man, as we were saying, 
<A NAME="831"></A>having attained the sense of rhythm, created and invented dancing; and 
<A NAME="832"></A>melody arousing and awakening rhythm, both united formed the choral 
<A NAME="833"></A>art?
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And one part of this subject has been already discussed 
<A NAME="836"></A>by us, and there still remains another to be discussed?
<A NAME="837"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Exactly.
<A NAME="838"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I have first a final word to add to my discourse about 
<A NAME="839"></A>drink, if you will allow me to do so.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What more have you to say?
<A NAME="841"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I should say that if a city seriously means to adopt the 
<A NAME="842"></A>practice of drinking under due regulation and with a view to the enforcement 
<A NAME="843"></A>of temperance, and in like manner, and on the same principle, will allow 
<A NAME="844"></A>of other pleasures, designing to gain the victory over them in this way 
<A NAME="845"></A>all of them may be used. But if the State makes drinking an amusement only, 
<A NAME="846"></A>and whoever likes may drink whenever he likes, and with whom he likes, 
<A NAME="847"></A>and add to this any other indulgences, I shall never agree or allow that 
<A NAME="848"></A>this city or this man should practise drinking. I would go further than 
<A NAME="849"></A>the Cretans and Lacedaemonians, and am disposed rather to the law of the 
<A NAME="850"></A>Carthaginians, that no one while he is on a campaign should be allowed 
<A NAME="851"></A>to taste wine at all, but that he should drink water during all that time, 
<A NAME="852"></A>and that in the city no slave, male or female, should ever drink wine; 
<A NAME="853"></A>and that no magistrates should drink during their year of office, nor should 
<A NAME="854"></A>pilots of vessels or judges while on duty taste wine at all, nor any one 
<A NAME="855"></A>who is going to hold a consultation about any matter of importance; nor 
<A NAME="856"></A>in the daytime at all, unless in consequence of exercise or as medicine; 
<A NAME="857"></A>nor again at night, when any one, either man or woman, is minded to get 
<A NAME="858"></A>children. There are numberless other cases also in which those who have 
<A NAME="859"></A>good sense and good laws ought not to drink wine, so that if what I say 
<A NAME="860"></A>is true, no city will need many vineyards. Their husbandry and their way 
<A NAME="861"></A>of life in general will follow an appointed order, and their cultivation 
<A NAME="862"></A>of the vine will be the most limited and the least common of their employments. 
<A NAME="863"></A>And this, Stranger, shall be the crown of my discourse about wine, if you 
<A NAME="864"></A>agree.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Excellent: we agree.
