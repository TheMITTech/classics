<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Socrates - GLAUCON
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Of he many excellences which I perceive in the order of our State, 
<A NAME="12"></A>there is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule about 
<A NAME="13"></A>poetry.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>To what do you refer?
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>To the rejection of imitative poetry, which certainly ought not to 
<A NAME="16"></A>be received; as I see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have 
<A NAME="17"></A>been distinguished.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean?
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Speaking in confidence, for I should not like to have my words repeated 
<A NAME="20"></A>to the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe --but I do not mind 
<A NAME="21"></A>saying to you, that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the understanding 
<A NAME="22"></A>of the hearers, and that the knowledge of their true nature is the only 
<A NAME="23"></A>antidote to them.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>Explain the purport of your remark.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Well, I will tell you, although I have always from my earliest youth 
<A NAME="26"></A>had an awe and love of Homer, which even now makes the words falter on 
<A NAME="27"></A>my lips, for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of that charming 
<A NAME="28"></A>tragic company; but a man is not to be reverenced more than the truth, 
<A NAME="29"></A>and therefore I will speak out.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Very good, he said.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Listen to me then, or rather, answer me.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Put your question.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Can you tell me what imitation is? for I really do not 
<A NAME="34"></A>know.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>A likely thing, then, that I should know.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>Why not? for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the 
<A NAME="37"></A>keener.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said; but in your presence, even if I had any faint 
<A NAME="39"></A>notion, I could not muster courage to utter it. Will you enquire 
<A NAME="40"></A>yourself?
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>Well then, shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner: Whenever 
<A NAME="42"></A>a number of individuals have a common name, we assume them to have also 
<A NAME="43"></A>a corresponding idea or form. Do you understand me?
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>I do.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Let us take any common instance; there are beds and tables in the world 
<A NAME="46"></A>--plenty of them, are there not?
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>But there are only two ideas or forms of them --one the idea of a bed, 
<A NAME="49"></A>the other of a table.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>And the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for 
<A NAME="52"></A>our use, in accordance with the idea --that is our way of speaking in this 
<A NAME="53"></A>and similar instances --but no artificer makes the ideas themselves: how 
<A NAME="54"></A>could he?
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>And there is another artist, --I should like to know what you would 
<A NAME="57"></A>say of him.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>Who is he?
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>One who is the maker of all the works of all other 
<A NAME="60"></A>workmen.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>What an extraordinary man!
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Wait a little, and there will be more reason for your saying so. For 
<A NAME="63"></A>this is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind, but plants 
<A NAME="64"></A>and animals, himself and all other things --the earth and heaven, and the 
<A NAME="65"></A>things which are in heaven or under the earth; he makes the gods 
<A NAME="66"></A>also.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>He must be a wizard and no mistake.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Oh! you are incredulous, are you? Do you mean that there is no such 
<A NAME="69"></A>maker or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these 
<A NAME="70"></A>things but in another not? Do you see that there is a way in which you 
<A NAME="71"></A>could make them all yourself?
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>What way?
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>An easy way enough; or rather, there are many ways in which the feat 
<A NAME="74"></A>might be quickly and easily accomplished, none quicker than that of turning 
<A NAME="75"></A>a mirror round and round --you would soon enough make the sun and the heavens, 
<A NAME="76"></A>and the earth and yourself, and other animals and plants, and all the, 
<A NAME="77"></A>other things of which we were just now speaking, in the 
<A NAME="78"></A>mirror.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; but they would be appearances 
<A NAME="80"></A>only.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Very good, I said, you are coming to the point now. And the painter 
<A NAME="82"></A>too is, as I conceive, just such another --a creator of appearances, is 
<A NAME="83"></A>he not?
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>But then I suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue. And 
<A NAME="86"></A>yet there is a sense in which the painter also creates a 
<A NAME="87"></A>bed?
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, but not a real bed.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>And what of the maker of the bed? Were you not saying that he too makes, 
<A NAME="90"></A>not the idea which, according to our view, is the essence of the bed, but 
<A NAME="91"></A>only a particular bed?
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I did.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Then if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true existence, 
<A NAME="94"></A>but only some semblance of existence; and if any one were to say that the 
<A NAME="95"></A>work of the maker of the bed, or of any other workman, has real existence, 
<A NAME="96"></A>he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>At any rate, he replied, philosophers would say that he was not 
<A NAME="98"></A>speaking the truth.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>No wonder, then, that his work too is an indistinct expression 
<A NAME="100"></A>of truth.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>No wonder.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire 
<A NAME="103"></A>who this imitator is?
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>If you please.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Well then, here are three beds: one existing in nature, which is made 
<A NAME="106"></A>by God, as I think that we may say --for no one else can be the 
<A NAME="107"></A>maker?
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>No.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>There is another which is the work of the carpenter?
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>And the work of the painter is a third?
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Beds, then, are of three kinds, and there are three artists who superintend 
<A NAME="114"></A>them: God, the maker of the bed, and the painter?
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>Yes, there are three of them.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>God, whether from choice or from necessity, made one bed in nature 
<A NAME="117"></A>and one only; two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever 
<A NAME="118"></A>will be made by God.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>Why is that?
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Because even if He had made but two, a third would still appear behind 
<A NAME="121"></A>them which both of them would have for their idea, and that would be the 
<A NAME="122"></A>ideal bed and the two others.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>God knew this, and He desired to be the real maker of a real bed, not 
<A NAME="125"></A>a particular maker of a particular bed, and therefore He created a bed 
<A NAME="126"></A>which is essentially and by nature one only.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>So we believe.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Shall we, then, speak of Him as the natural author or maker of the 
<A NAME="129"></A>bed?
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he replied; inasmuch as by the natural process of creation 
<A NAME="131"></A>He is the author of this and of all other things.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>And what shall we say of the carpenter --is not he also the maker 
<A NAME="133"></A>of the bed?
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>But would you call the painter a creator and maker?
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Yet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the 
<A NAME="138"></A>bed?
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>I think, he said, that we may fairly designate him as the imitator 
<A NAME="140"></A>of that which the others make.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>Good, I said; then you call him who is third in the descent from 
<A NAME="142"></A>nature an imitator?
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>And the tragic poet is an imitator, and therefore, like all other imitators, 
<A NAME="145"></A>he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth?
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>That appears to be so.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Then about the imitator we are agreed. And what about the painter? 
<A NAME="148"></A>--I would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which 
<A NAME="149"></A>originally exists in nature, or only the creations of 
<A NAME="150"></A>artists?
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>The latter.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>As they are or as they appear? You have still to determine 
<A NAME="153"></A>this.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>What do you mean?
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>I mean, that you may look at a bed from different points of view, obliquely 
<A NAME="156"></A>or directly or from any other point of view, and the bed will appear different, 
<A NAME="157"></A>but there is no difference in reality. And the same of all 
<A NAME="158"></A>things.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, the difference is only apparent.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Now let me ask you another question: Which is the art of painting designed 
<A NAME="161"></A>to be --an imitation of things as they are, or as they appear --of appearance 
<A NAME="162"></A>or of reality?
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>Of appearance.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Then the imitator, I said, is a long way off the truth, and can do 
<A NAME="165"></A>all things because he lightly touches on a small part of them, and that 
<A NAME="166"></A>part an image. For example: A painter will paint a cobbler, carpenter, 
<A NAME="167"></A>or any other artist, though he knows nothing of their arts; and, if he 
<A NAME="168"></A>is a good artist, he may deceive children or simple persons, when he shows 
<A NAME="169"></A>them his picture of a carpenter from a distance, and they will fancy that 
<A NAME="170"></A>they are looking at a real carpenter.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>And whenever any one informs us that he has found a man knows all the 
<A NAME="173"></A>arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single thing with 
<A NAME="174"></A>a higher degree of accuracy than any other man --whoever tells us this, 
<A NAME="175"></A>I think that we can only imagine to be a simple creature who is likely 
<A NAME="176"></A>to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and whom he 
<A NAME="177"></A>thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyse the nature 
<A NAME="178"></A>of knowledge and ignorance and imitation.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>Most true.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>And so, when we hear persons saying that the tragedians, and Homer, 
<A NAME="181"></A>who is at their head, know all the arts and all things human, virtue as 
<A NAME="182"></A>well as vice, and divine things too, for that the good poet cannot compose 
<A NAME="183"></A>well unless he knows his subject, and that he who has not this knowledge 
<A NAME="184"></A>can never be a poet, we ought to consider whether here also there may not 
<A NAME="185"></A>be a similar illusion. Perhaps they may have come across imitators and 
<A NAME="186"></A>been deceived by them; they may not have remembered when they saw their 
<A NAME="187"></A>works that these were but imitations thrice removed from the truth, and 
<A NAME="188"></A>could easily be made without any knowledge of the truth, because they are 
<A NAME="189"></A>appearances only and not realities? Or, after all, they may be in the right, 
<A NAME="190"></A>and poets do really know the things about which they seem to the many to 
<A NAME="191"></A>speak so well?
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>The question, he said, should by all means be 
<A NAME="193"></A>considered.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original 
<A NAME="195"></A>as well as the image, he would seriously devote himself to the image-making 
<A NAME="196"></A>branch? Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life, 
<A NAME="197"></A>as if he had nothing higher in him?
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>I should say not.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>The real artist, who knew what he was imitating, would be interested 
<A NAME="200"></A>in realities and not in imitations; and would desire to leave as memorials 
<A NAME="201"></A>of himself works many and fair; and, instead of being the author of encomiums, 
<A NAME="202"></A>he would prefer to be the theme of them.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that would be to him a source of much greater honour 
<A NAME="204"></A>and profit.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>Then, I said, we must put a question to Homer; not about medicine, 
<A NAME="206"></A>or any of the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer: we are not 
<A NAME="207"></A>going to ask him, or any other poet, whether he has cured patients like 
<A NAME="208"></A>Asclepius, or left behind him a school of medicine such as the Asclepiads 
<A NAME="209"></A>were, or whether he only talks about medicine and other arts at second 
<A NAME="210"></A>hand; but we have a right to know respecting military tactics, politics, 
<A NAME="211"></A>education, which are the chiefest and noblest subjects of his poems, and 
<A NAME="212"></A>we may fairly ask him about them. 'Friend Homer,' then we say to him, 'if 
<A NAME="213"></A>you are only in the second remove from truth in what you say of virtue, 
<A NAME="214"></A>and not in the third --not an image maker or imitator --and if you are 
<A NAME="215"></A>able to discern what pursuits make men better or worse in private or public 
<A NAME="216"></A>life, tell us what State was ever better governed by your help? The good 
<A NAME="217"></A>order of Lacedaemon is due to Lycurgus, and many other cities great and 
<A NAME="218"></A>small have been similarly benefited by others; but who says that you have 
<A NAME="219"></A>been a good legislator to them and have done them any good? Italy and Sicily 
<A NAME="220"></A>boast of Charondas, and there is Solon who is renowned among us; but what 
<A NAME="221"></A>city has anything to say about you?' Is there any city which he might 
<A NAME="222"></A>name?
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>I think not, said Glaucon; not even the Homerids themselves pretend 
<A NAME="224"></A>that he was a legislator.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully 
<A NAME="226"></A>by him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>There is not.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>Or is there any invention of his, applicable to the arts or to human 
<A NAME="229"></A>life, such as Thales the Milesian or Anacharsis the Scythian, and other 
<A NAME="230"></A>ingenious men have conceived, which is attributed to 
<A NAME="231"></A>him?
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>There is absolutely nothing of the kind.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>But, if Homer never did any public service, was he privately a guide 
<A NAME="234"></A>or teacher of any? Had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate 
<A NAME="235"></A>with him, and who handed down to posterity an Homeric way of life, such 
<A NAME="236"></A>as was established by Pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his wisdom, 
<A NAME="237"></A>and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the order which 
<A NAME="238"></A>was named after him?
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>Nothing of the kind is recorded of him. For surely, Socrates, Creophylus, 
<A NAME="240"></A>the companion of Homer, that child of flesh, whose name always makes us 
<A NAME="241"></A>laugh, might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity, if, as is said, 
<A NAME="242"></A>Homer was greatly neglected by him and others in his own day when he was 
<A NAME="243"></A>alive?
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I replied, that is the tradition. But can you imagine, Glaucon, 
<A NAME="245"></A>that if Homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind --if 
<A NAME="246"></A>he had possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator --can you imagine, 
<A NAME="247"></A>I say, that he would not have had many followers, and been honoured and 
<A NAME="248"></A>loved by them? Protagoras of Abdera, and Prodicus of Ceos, and a host of 
<A NAME="249"></A>others, have only to whisper to their contemporaries: 'You will never be 
<A NAME="250"></A>able to manage either your own house or your own State until you appoint 
<A NAME="251"></A>us to be your ministers of education' --and this ingenious device of theirs 
<A NAME="252"></A>has such an effect in making them love them that their companions all but 
<A NAME="253"></A>carry them about on their shoulders. And is it conceivable that the contemporaries 
<A NAME="254"></A>of Homer, or again of Hesiod, would have allowed either of them to go about 
<A NAME="255"></A>as rhapsodists, if they had really been able to make mankind virtuous? 
<A NAME="256"></A>Would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold, and 
<A NAME="257"></A>have compelled them to stay at home with them? Or, if the master would 
<A NAME="258"></A>not stay, then the disciples would have followed him about everywhere, 
<A NAME="259"></A>until they had got education enough?
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>Yes, Socrates, that, I think, is quite true.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals, beginning 
<A NAME="262"></A>with Homer, are only imitators; they copy images of virtue and the like, 
<A NAME="263"></A>but the truth they never reach? The poet is like a painter who, as we have 
<A NAME="264"></A>already observed, will make a likeness of a cobbler though he understands 
<A NAME="265"></A>nothing of cobbling; and his picture is good enough for those who know 
<A NAME="266"></A>no more than he does, and judge only by colours and 
<A NAME="267"></A>figures.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>Quite so.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>In like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to lay 
<A NAME="270"></A>on the colours of the several arts, himself understanding their nature 
<A NAME="271"></A>only enough to imitate them; and other people, who are as ignorant as he 
<A NAME="272"></A>is, and judge only from his words, imagine that if he speaks of cobbling, 
<A NAME="273"></A>or of military tactics, or of anything else, in metre and harmony and rhythm, 
<A NAME="274"></A>he speaks very well --such is the sweet influence which melody and rhythm 
<A NAME="275"></A>by nature have. And I think that you must have observed again and again 
<A NAME="276"></A>what a poor appearance the tales of poets make when stripped of the colours 
<A NAME="277"></A>which music puts upon them, and recited in simple prose.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>They are like faces which were never really beautiful, but only blooming; 
<A NAME="280"></A>and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them?
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>Here is another point: The imitator or maker of the image knows nothing 
<A NAME="283"></A>of true existence; he knows appearances only. Am I not 
<A NAME="284"></A>right?
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Then let us have a clear understanding, and not be satisfied with half 
<A NAME="287"></A>an explanation.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>Proceed.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Of the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint a 
<A NAME="290"></A>bit?
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>And the worker in leather and brass will make them?
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>But does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins? Nay, 
<A NAME="295"></A>hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them; only the horseman 
<A NAME="296"></A>who knows how to use them --he knows their right form.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>Most true.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>And may we not say the same of all things?
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>What?
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>That there are three arts which are concerned with all things: one 
<A NAME="301"></A>which uses, another which makes, a third which imitates 
<A NAME="302"></A>them?
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>And the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure, animate or 
<A NAME="305"></A>inanimate, and of every action of man, is relative to the use for which 
<A NAME="306"></A>nature or the artist has intended them.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>Then the user of them must have the greatest experience of them, and 
<A NAME="309"></A>he must indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop themselves 
<A NAME="310"></A>in use; for example, the flute-player will tell the flute-maker which of 
<A NAME="311"></A>his flutes is satisfactory to the performer; he will tell him how he ought 
<A NAME="312"></A>to make them, and the other will attend to his instructions?
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>The one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness 
<A NAME="315"></A>and badness of flutes, while the other, confiding in him, will do what 
<A NAME="316"></A>he is told by him?
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>The instrument is the same, but about the excellence or badness of 
<A NAME="319"></A>it the maker will only attain to a correct belief; and this he will gain 
<A NAME="320"></A>from him who knows, by talking to him and being compelled to hear what 
<A NAME="321"></A>he has to say, whereas the user will have knowledge?
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>But will the imitator have either? Will he know from use whether or 
<A NAME="324"></A>no his drawing is correct or beautiful? Or will he have right opinion from 
<A NAME="325"></A>being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him instructions 
<A NAME="326"></A>about what he should draw?
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>Neither.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge 
<A NAME="329"></A>about the goodness or badness of his imitations?
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>I suppose not.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>The imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about 
<A NAME="332"></A>his own creations?
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>Nay, very much the reverse.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>And still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing 
<A NAME="335"></A>good or bad, and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which appears 
<A NAME="336"></A>to be good to the ignorant multitude?
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>Just so.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Thus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no knowledge 
<A NAME="339"></A>worth mentioning of what he imitates. Imitation is only a kind of play 
<A NAME="340"></A>or sport, and the tragic poets, whether they write in iambic or in Heroic 
<A NAME="341"></A>verse, are imitators in the highest degree?
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>And now tell me, I conjure you, has not imitation been shown by us 
<A NAME="344"></A>to be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the 
<A NAME="345"></A>truth?
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>And what is the faculty in man to which imitation is 
<A NAME="348"></A>addressed?
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>What do you mean?
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>I will explain: The body which is large when seen near, appears small 
<A NAME="351"></A>when seen at a distance?
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>And the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water, 
<A NAME="354"></A>and crooked when in the water; and the concave becomes convex, owing to 
<A NAME="355"></A>the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable. Thus every sort 
<A NAME="356"></A>of confusion is revealed within us; and this is that weakness of the human 
<A NAME="357"></A>mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light and shadow 
<A NAME="358"></A>and other ingenious devices imposes, having an effect upon us like 
<A NAME="359"></A>magic.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>And the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue 
<A NAME="362"></A>of the human understanding-there is the beauty of them --and the apparent 
<A NAME="363"></A>greater or less, or more or heavier, no longer have the mastery over us, 
<A NAME="364"></A>but give way before calculation and measure and weight?
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>Most true.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>And this, surely, must be the work of the calculating and rational 
<A NAME="367"></A>principle in the soul
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>To be sure.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>And when this principle measures and certifies that some things are 
<A NAME="370"></A>equal, or that some are greater or less than others, there occurs an apparent 
<A NAME="371"></A>contradiction?
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>But were we not saying that such a contradiction is the same faculty 
<A NAME="374"></A>cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same 
<A NAME="375"></A>thing?
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure 
<A NAME="378"></A>is not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with 
<A NAME="379"></A>measure?
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>And the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to 
<A NAME="382"></A>measure and calculation?
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>And that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles 
<A NAME="385"></A>of the soul?
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>No doubt.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>This was the conclusion at which I was seeking to arrive when I said 
<A NAME="388"></A>that painting or drawing, and imitation in general, when doing their own 
<A NAME="389"></A>proper work, are far removed from truth, and the companions and friends 
<A NAME="390"></A>and associates of a principle within us which is equally removed from reason, 
<A NAME="391"></A>and that they have no true or healthy aim.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>The imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior, and has inferior 
<A NAME="394"></A>offspring.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>And is this confined to the sight only, or does it extend to the hearing 
<A NAME="397"></A>also, relating in fact to what we term poetry?
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>Probably the same would be true of poetry.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Do not rely, I said, on a probability derived from the analogy of painting; 
<A NAME="400"></A>but let us examine further and see whether the faculty with which poetical 
<A NAME="401"></A>imitation is concerned is good or bad.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>By all means.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>We may state the question thus: --Imitation imitates the actions of 
<A NAME="404"></A>men, whether voluntary or involuntary, on which, as they imagine, a good 
<A NAME="405"></A>or bad result has ensued, and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly. Is there 
<A NAME="406"></A>anything more?
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>No, there is nothing else.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>But in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with himself 
<A NAME="409"></A>--or rather, as in the instance of sight there was confusion and opposition 
<A NAME="410"></A>in his opinions about the same things, so here also is there not strife 
<A NAME="411"></A>and inconsistency in his life? Though I need hardly raise the question 
<A NAME="412"></A>again, for I remember that all this has been already admitted; and the 
<A NAME="413"></A>soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten thousand similar 
<A NAME="414"></A>oppositions occurring at the same moment?
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>And we were right, he said.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>Yes, I said, thus far we were right; but there was an omission which 
<A NAME="417"></A>must now be supplied.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>What was the omission?
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Were we not saying that a good man, who has the misfortune to lose 
<A NAME="420"></A>his son or anything else which is most dear to him, will bear the loss 
<A NAME="421"></A>with more equanimity than another?
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>But will he have no sorrow, or shall we say that although he cannot 
<A NAME="424"></A>help sorrowing, he will moderate his sorrow?
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>The latter, he said, is the truer statement.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Tell me: will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his 
<A NAME="427"></A>sorrow when he is seen by his equals, or when he is 
<A NAME="428"></A>alone?
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>It will make a great difference whether he is seen or 
<A NAME="430"></A>not.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>When he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things 
<A NAME="432"></A>which he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him 
<A NAME="433"></A>do?
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>There is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist, 
<A NAME="436"></A>as well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge 
<A NAME="437"></A>his sorrow?
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>But when a man is drawn in two opposite directions, to and from the 
<A NAME="440"></A>same object, this, as we affirm, necessarily implies two distinct principles 
<A NAME="441"></A>in him?
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>One of them is ready to follow the guidance of the 
<A NAME="444"></A>law?
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>How do you mean?
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>The law would say that to be patient under suffering is best, and that 
<A NAME="447"></A>we should not give way to impatience, as there is no knowing whether such 
<A NAME="448"></A>things are good or evil; and nothing is gained by impatience; also, because 
<A NAME="449"></A>no human thing is of serious importance, and grief stands in the way of 
<A NAME="450"></A>that which at the moment is most required.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>What is most required? he asked.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>That we should take counsel about what has happened, and when the dice 
<A NAME="453"></A>have been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best; 
<A NAME="454"></A>not, like children who have had a fall, keeping hold of the part struck 
<A NAME="455"></A>and wasting time in setting up a howl, but always accustoming the soul 
<A NAME="456"></A>forthwith to apply a remedy, raising up that which is sickly and fallen, 
<A NAME="457"></A>banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that is the true way of meeting the attacks of 
<A NAME="459"></A>fortune.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said; and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion 
<A NAME="461"></A>of reason?
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>And the other principle, which inclines us to recollection of our troubles 
<A NAME="464"></A>and to lamentation, and can never have enough of them, we may call irrational, 
<A NAME="465"></A>useless, and cowardly?
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, we may.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>And does not the latter --I mean the rebellious principle --furnish 
<A NAME="468"></A>a great variety of materials for imitation? Whereas the wise and calm temperament, 
<A NAME="469"></A>being always nearly equable, is not easy to imitate or to appreciate when 
<A NAME="470"></A>imitated, especially at a public festival when a promiscuous crowd is assembled 
<A NAME="471"></A>in a theatre. For the feeling represented is one to which they are 
<A NAME="472"></A>strangers.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Then the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature 
<A NAME="475"></A>made, nor is his art intended, to please or to affect the principle in 
<A NAME="476"></A>the soul; but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper, which is 
<A NAME="477"></A>easily imitated?
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>And now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the painter, 
<A NAME="480"></A>for he is like him in two ways: first, inasmuch as his creations have an 
<A NAME="481"></A>inferior degree of truth --in this, I say, he is like him; and he is also 
<A NAME="482"></A>like him in being concerned with an inferior part of the soul; and therefore 
<A NAME="483"></A>we shall be right in refusing to admit him into a well-ordered State, because 
<A NAME="484"></A>he awakens and nourishes and strengthens the feelings and impairs the reason. 
<A NAME="485"></A>As in a city when the evil are permitted to have authority and the good 
<A NAME="486"></A>are put out of the way, so in the soul of man, as we maintain, the imitative 
<A NAME="487"></A>poet implants an evil constitution, for he indulges the irrational nature 
<A NAME="488"></A>which has no discernment of greater and less, but thinks the same thing 
<A NAME="489"></A>at one time great and at another small-he is a manufacturer of images and 
<A NAME="490"></A>is very far removed from the truth.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>But we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our accusation: 
<A NAME="493"></A>--the power which poetry has of harming even the good (and there are very 
<A NAME="494"></A>few who are not harmed), is surely an awful thing?
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>Yes, certainly, if the effect is what you say.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Hear and judge: The best of us, as I conceive, when we listen to a 
<A NAME="497"></A>passage of Homer, or one of the tragedians, in which he represents some 
<A NAME="498"></A>pitiful hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration, or weeping, 
<A NAME="499"></A>and smiting his breast --the best of us, you know, delight in giving way 
<A NAME="500"></A>to sympathy, and are in raptures at the excellence of the poet who stirs 
<A NAME="501"></A>our feelings most.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>Yes, of course I know.
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>But when any sorrow of our own happens to us, then you may observe 
<A NAME="504"></A>that we pride ourselves on the opposite quality --we would fain be quiet 
<A NAME="505"></A>and patient; this is the manly part, and the other which delighted us in 
<A NAME="506"></A>the recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>Now can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that 
<A NAME="509"></A>which any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own 
<A NAME="510"></A>person?
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>No, he said, that is certainly not reasonable.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Nay, I said, quite reasonable from one point of 
<A NAME="513"></A>view.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>What point of view?
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>If you consider, I said, that when in misfortune we feel a natural 
<A NAME="516"></A>hunger and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation, and 
<A NAME="517"></A>that this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is 
<A NAME="518"></A>satisfied and delighted by the poets;-the better nature in each of us, 
<A NAME="519"></A>not having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit, allows the sympathetic 
<A NAME="520"></A>element to break loose because the sorrow is another's; and the spectator 
<A NAME="521"></A>fancies that there can be no disgrace to himself in praising and pitying 
<A NAME="522"></A>any one who comes telling him what a good man he is, and making a fuss 
<A NAME="523"></A>about his troubles; he thinks that the pleasure is a gain, and why should 
<A NAME="524"></A>he be supercilious and lose this and the poem too? Few persons ever reflect, 
<A NAME="525"></A>as I should imagine, that from the evil of other men something of evil 
<A NAME="526"></A>is communicated to themselves. And so the feeling of sorrow which has gathered 
<A NAME="527"></A>strength at the sight of the misfortunes of others is with difficulty repressed 
<A NAME="528"></A>in our own.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>How very true!
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>And does not the same hold also of the ridiculous? There are jests 
<A NAME="531"></A>which you would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic stage, 
<A NAME="532"></A>or indeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused by them, 
<A NAME="533"></A>and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness; --the case of pity 
<A NAME="534"></A>is repeated; --there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to 
<A NAME="535"></A>raise a laugh, and this which you once restrained by reason, because you 
<A NAME="536"></A>were afraid of being thought a buffoon, is now let out again; and having 
<A NAME="537"></A>stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre, you are betrayed unconsciously 
<A NAME="538"></A>to yourself into playing the comic poet at home.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>Quite true, he said.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>And the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections, 
<A NAME="541"></A>of desire and pain and pleasure, which are held to be inseparable from 
<A NAME="542"></A>every action ---in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions instead 
<A NAME="543"></A>of drying them up; she lets them rule, although they ought to be controlled, 
<A NAME="544"></A>if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>I cannot deny it.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Therefore, Glaucon, I said, whenever you meet with any of the eulogists 
<A NAME="547"></A>of Homer declaring that he has been the educator of Hellas, and that he 
<A NAME="548"></A>is profitable for education and for the ordering of human things, and that 
<A NAME="549"></A>you should take him up again and again and get to know him and regulate 
<A NAME="550"></A>your whole life according to him, we may love and honour those who say 
<A NAME="551"></A>these things --they are excellent people, as far as their lights extend; 
<A NAME="552"></A>and we are ready to acknowledge that Homer is the greatest of poets and 
<A NAME="553"></A>first of tragedy writers; but we must remain firm in our conviction that 
<A NAME="554"></A>hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the only poetry which ought 
<A NAME="555"></A>to be admitted into our State. For if you go beyond this and allow the 
<A NAME="556"></A>honeyed muse to enter, either in epic or lyric verse, not law and the reason 
<A NAME="557"></A>of mankind, which by common consent have ever been deemed best, but pleasure 
<A NAME="558"></A>and pain will be the rulers in our State.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>That is most true, he said.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>And now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry, let this our 
<A NAME="561"></A>defence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in sending 
<A NAME="562"></A>away out of our State an art having the tendencies which we have described; 
<A NAME="563"></A>for reason constrained us. But that she may impute to us any harshness 
<A NAME="564"></A>or want of politeness, let us tell her that there is an ancient quarrel 
<A NAME="565"></A>between philosophy and poetry; of which there are many proofs, such as 
<A NAME="566"></A>the saying of 'the yelping hound howling at her lord,' or of one 'mighty 
<A NAME="567"></A>in the vain talk of fools,' and 'the mob of sages circumventing Zeus,' 
<A NAME="568"></A>and the 'subtle thinkers who are beggars after all'; and there are innumerable 
<A NAME="569"></A>other signs of ancient enmity between them. Notwithstanding this, let us 
<A NAME="570"></A>assure our sweet friend and the sister arts of imitation that if she will 
<A NAME="571"></A>only prove her title to exist in a well-ordered State we shall be delighted 
<A NAME="572"></A>to receive her --we are very conscious of her charms; but we may not on 
<A NAME="573"></A>that account betray the truth. I dare say, Glaucon, that you are as much 
<A NAME="574"></A>charmed by her as I am, especially when she appears in 
<A NAME="575"></A>Homer?
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>Yes, indeed, I am greatly charmed.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Shall I propose, then, that she be allowed to return from exile, but 
<A NAME="578"></A>upon this condition only --that she make a defence of herself in lyrical 
<A NAME="579"></A>or some other metre?
<A NAME="580"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>And we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of 
<A NAME="582"></A>poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf: 
<A NAME="583"></A>let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to States and 
<A NAME="584"></A>to human life, and we will listen in a kindly spirit; for if this can be 
<A NAME="585"></A>proved we shall surely be the gainers --I mean, if there is a use in poetry 
<A NAME="586"></A>as well as a delight?
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said, we shall the gainers.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>If her defence fails, then, my dear friend, like other persons who 
<A NAME="589"></A>are enamoured of something, but put a restraint upon themselves when they 
<A NAME="590"></A>think their desires are opposed to their interests, so too must we after 
<A NAME="591"></A>the manner of lovers give her up, though not without a struggle. We too 
<A NAME="592"></A>are inspired by that love of poetry which the education of noble States 
<A NAME="593"></A>has implanted in us, and therefore we would have her appear at her best 
<A NAME="594"></A>and truest; but so long as she is unable to make good her defence, this 
<A NAME="595"></A>argument of ours shall be a charm to us, which we will repeat to ourselves 
<A NAME="596"></A>while we listen to her strains; that we may not fall away into the childish 
<A NAME="597"></A>love of her which captivates the many. At all events we are well aware 
<A NAME="598"></A>that poetry being such as we have described is not to be regarded seriously 
<A NAME="599"></A>as attaining to the truth; and he who listens to her, fearing for the safety 
<A NAME="600"></A>of the city which is within him, should be on his guard against her seductions 
<A NAME="601"></A>and make our words his law.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, I quite agree with you.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>Yes, I said, my dear Glaucon, for great is the issue at stake, greater 
<A NAME="604"></A>than appears, whether a man is to be good or bad. And what will any one 
<A NAME="605"></A>be profited if under the influence of honour or money or power, aye, or 
<A NAME="606"></A>under the excitement of poetry, he neglect justice and 
<A NAME="607"></A>virtue?
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; I have been convinced by the argument, as I believe 
<A NAME="609"></A>that any one else would have been.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>And yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards 
<A NAME="611"></A>which await virtue.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>What, are there any greater still? If there are, they must be of 
<A NAME="613"></A>an inconceivable greatness.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>Why, I said, what was ever great in a short time? The whole period 
<A NAME="615"></A>of threescore years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison 
<A NAME="616"></A>with eternity?
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR>Say rather 'nothing,' he replied.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>And should an immortal being seriously think of this little space rather 
<A NAME="619"></A>than of the whole?
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>Of the whole, certainly. But why do you ask?
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Are you not aware, I said, that the soul of man is immortal and 
<A NAME="622"></A>imperishable?
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>He looked at me in astonishment, and said: No, by heaven: And are 
<A NAME="624"></A>you really prepared to maintain this?
<A NAME="625"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said, I ought to be, and you too --there is no difficulty 
<A NAME="626"></A>in proving it.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>I see a great difficulty; but I should like to hear you state this 
<A NAME="628"></A>argument of which you make so light.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>Listen then.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>I am attending.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>There is a thing which you call good and another which you call 
<A NAME="632"></A>evil?
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he replied.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>Would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying 
<A NAME="635"></A>element is the evil, and the saving and improving element the 
<A NAME="636"></A>good?
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>And you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil; as ophthalmia 
<A NAME="639"></A>is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body; as mildew is of 
<A NAME="640"></A>corn, and rot of timber, or rust of copper and iron: in everything, or 
<A NAME="641"></A>in almost everything, there is an inherent evil and 
<A NAME="642"></A>disease?
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>And anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil, 
<A NAME="645"></A>and at last wholly dissolves and dies?
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>The vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction of each; 
<A NAME="648"></A>and if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will; for 
<A NAME="649"></A>good certainly will not destroy them, nor again, that which is neither 
<A NAME="650"></A>good nor evil.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>If, then, we find any nature which having this inherent corruption 
<A NAME="653"></A>cannot be dissolved or destroyed, we may be certain that of such a nature 
<A NAME="654"></A>there is no destruction?
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>That may be assumed.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Well, I said, and is there no evil which corrupts the 
<A NAME="657"></A>soul?
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Yes, he said, there are all the evils which we were just now passing 
<A NAME="659"></A>in review: unrighteousness, intemperance, cowardice, 
<A NAME="660"></A>ignorance.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR>But does any of these dissolve or destroy her? --and here do not 
<A NAME="662"></A>let us fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man, 
<A NAME="663"></A>when he is detected, perishes through his own injustice, which is an evil 
<A NAME="664"></A>of the soul. Take the analogy of the body: The evil of the body is a disease 
<A NAME="665"></A>which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body; and all the things of 
<A NAME="666"></A>which we were just now speaking come to annihilation through their own 
<A NAME="667"></A>corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so destroying them. 
<A NAME="668"></A>Is not this true?
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Consider the soul in like manner. Does the injustice or other evil 
<A NAME="671"></A>which exists in the soul waste and consume her? Do they by attaching to 
<A NAME="672"></A>the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate 
<A NAME="673"></A>her from the body ?
<A NAME="674"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>And yet, I said, it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish 
<A NAME="676"></A>from without through affection of external evil which could not be destroyed 
<A NAME="677"></A>from within by a corruption of its own?
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>It is, he replied.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Consider, I said, Glaucon, that even the badness of food, whether staleness, 
<A NAME="680"></A>decomposition, or any other bad quality, when confined to the actual food, 
<A NAME="681"></A>is not supposed to destroy the body; although, if the badness of food communicates 
<A NAME="682"></A>corruption to the body, then we should say that the body has been destroyed 
<A NAME="683"></A>by a corruption of itself, which is disease, brought on by this; but that 
<A NAME="684"></A>the body, being one thing, can be destroyed by the badness of food, which 
<A NAME="685"></A>is another, and which does not engender any natural infection --this we 
<A NAME="686"></A>shall absolutely deny?
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>And, on the same principle, unless some bodily evil can produce an 
<A NAME="689"></A>evil of the soul, we must not suppose that the soul, which is one thing, 
<A NAME="690"></A>can be dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to 
<A NAME="691"></A>another?
<A NAME="692"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, there is reason in that.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>Either then, let us refute this conclusion, or, while it remains unrefuted, 
<A NAME="694"></A>let us never say that fever, or any other disease, or the knife put to 
<A NAME="695"></A>the throat, or even the cutting up of the whole body into the minutest 
<A NAME="696"></A>pieces, can destroy the soul, until she herself is proved to become more 
<A NAME="697"></A>unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things being done to the 
<A NAME="698"></A>body; but that the soul, or anything else if not destroyed by an internal 
<A NAME="699"></A>evil, can be destroyed by an external one, is not to. be affirmed by any 
<A NAME="700"></A>man.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR>And surely, he replied, no one will ever prove that the souls of 
<A NAME="702"></A>men become more unjust in consequence of death.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR>But if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the 
<A NAME="704"></A>soul boldly denies this, and says that the dying do really become more 
<A NAME="705"></A>evil and unrighteous, then, if the speaker is right, I suppose that injustice, 
<A NAME="706"></A>like disease, must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust, and that those 
<A NAME="707"></A>who take this disorder die by the natural inherent power of destruction 
<A NAME="708"></A>which evil has, and which kills them sooner or later, but in quite another 
<A NAME="709"></A>way from that in which, at present, the wicked receive death at the hands 
<A NAME="710"></A>of others as the penalty of their deeds?
<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR>Nay, he said, in that case injustice, if fatal to the unjust, will 
<A NAME="712"></A>not be so very terrible to him, for he will be delivered from evil. But 
<A NAME="713"></A>I rather suspect the opposite to be the truth, and that injustice which, 
<A NAME="714"></A>if it have the power, will murder others, keeps the murderer alive --aye, 
<A NAME="715"></A>and well awake too; so far removed is her dwelling-place from being a house 
<A NAME="716"></A>of death.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR>True, I said; if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul 
<A NAME="718"></A>is unable to kill or destroy her, hardly will that which is appointed to 
<A NAME="719"></A>be the destruction of some other body, destroy a soul or anything else 
<A NAME="720"></A>except that of which it was appointed to be the destruction.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that can hardly be.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>But the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil, whether inherent 
<A NAME="723"></A>or external, must exist for ever, and if existing for ever, must be 
<A NAME="724"></A>immortal?
<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>That is the conclusion, I said; and, if a true conclusion, then the 
<A NAME="727"></A>souls must always be the same, for if none be destroyed they will not diminish 
<A NAME="728"></A>in number. Neither will they increase, for the increase of the immortal 
<A NAME="729"></A>natures must come from something mortal, and all things would thus end 
<A NAME="730"></A>in immortality.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>But this we cannot believe --reason will not allow us --any more than 
<A NAME="733"></A>we can believe the soul, in her truest nature, to be full of variety and 
<A NAME="734"></A>difference and dissimilarity.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean? he said.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>The soul, I said, being, as is now proven, immortal, must be the fairest 
<A NAME="737"></A>of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements?
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>Her immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument, and there 
<A NAME="740"></A>are many other proofs; but to see her as she really is, not as we now behold 
<A NAME="741"></A>her, marred by communion with the body and other miseries, you must contemplate 
<A NAME="742"></A>her with the eye of reason, in her original purity; and then her beauty 
<A NAME="743"></A>will be revealed, and justice and injustice and all the things which we 
<A NAME="744"></A>have described will be manifested more clearly. Thus far, we have spoken 
<A NAME="745"></A>the truth concerning her as she appears at present, but we must remember 
<A NAME="746"></A>also that we have seen her only in a condition which may be compared to 
<A NAME="747"></A>that of the sea-god Glaucus, whose original image can hardly be discerned 
<A NAME="748"></A>because his natural members are broken off and crushed and damaged by the 
<A NAME="749"></A>waves in all sorts of ways, and incrustations have grown over them of seaweed 
<A NAME="750"></A>and shells and stones, so that he is more like some monster than he is 
<A NAME="751"></A>to his own natural form. And the soul which we behold is in a similar condition, 
<A NAME="752"></A>disfigured by ten thousand ills. But not there, Glaucon, not there must 
<A NAME="753"></A>we look.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>Where then?
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>At her love of wisdom. Let us see whom she affects, and what society 
<A NAME="756"></A>and converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal 
<A NAME="757"></A>and eternal and divine; also how different she would become if wholly following 
<A NAME="758"></A>this superior principle, and borne by a divine impulse out of the ocean 
<A NAME="759"></A>in which she now is, and disengaged from the stones and shells and things 
<A NAME="760"></A>of earth and rock which in wild variety spring up around her because she 
<A NAME="761"></A>feeds upon earth, and is overgrown by the good things of this life as they 
<A NAME="762"></A>are termed: then you would see her as she is, and know whether she has 
<A NAME="763"></A>one shape only or many, or what her nature is. Of her affections and of 
<A NAME="764"></A>the forms which she takes in this present life I think that we have now 
<A NAME="765"></A>said enough.
<A NAME="766"></A><BR><BR>True, he replied.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>And thus, I said, we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument; 
<A NAME="768"></A>we have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice, which, as you 
<A NAME="769"></A>were saying, are to be found in Homer and Hesiod; but justice in her own 
<A NAME="770"></A>nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature. Let a 
<A NAME="771"></A>man do what is just, whether he have the ring of Gyges or not, and even 
<A NAME="772"></A>if in addition to the ring of Gyges he put on the helmet of 
<A NAME="773"></A>Hades.
<A NAME="774"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>And now, Glaucon, there will be no harm in further enumerating how 
<A NAME="776"></A>many and how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues 
<A NAME="777"></A>procure to the soul from gods and men, both in life and after 
<A NAME="778"></A>death.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not, he said.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>Will you repay me, then, what you borrowed in the 
<A NAME="781"></A>argument?
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>What did I borrow?
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>The assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust 
<A NAME="784"></A>just: for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case could 
<A NAME="785"></A>not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men, still this admission ought 
<A NAME="786"></A>to be made for the sake of the argument, in order that pure justice might 
<A NAME="787"></A>be weighed against pure injustice. Do you remember?
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR>I should be much to blame if I had forgotten.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Then, as the cause is decided, I demand on behalf of justice that the 
<A NAME="790"></A>estimation in which she is held by gods and men and which we acknowledge 
<A NAME="791"></A>to be her due should now be restored to her by us; since she has been shown 
<A NAME="792"></A>to confer reality, and not to deceive those who truly possess her, let 
<A NAME="793"></A>what has been taken from her be given back, that so she may win that palm 
<A NAME="794"></A>of appearance which is hers also, and which she gives to her 
<A NAME="795"></A>own.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR><BR>The demand, he said, is just.
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>In the first place, I said --and this is the first thing which you 
<A NAME="798"></A>will have to give back --the nature both of the just and unjust is truly 
<A NAME="799"></A>known to the gods.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR>Granted.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>And if they are both known to them, one must be the friend and the 
<A NAME="802"></A>other the enemy of the gods, as we admitted from the 
<A NAME="803"></A>beginning?
<A NAME="804"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>And the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all 
<A NAME="806"></A>things at their best, excepting only such evil as is the necessary consequence 
<A NAME="807"></A>of former sins?
<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>Then this must be our notion of the just man, that even when he is 
<A NAME="810"></A>in poverty or sickness, or any other seeming misfortune, all things will 
<A NAME="811"></A>in the end work together for good to him in life and death: for the gods 
<A NAME="812"></A>have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like God, 
<A NAME="813"></A>as far as man can attain the divine likeness, by the pursuit of 
<A NAME="814"></A>virtue?
<A NAME="815"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; if he is like God he will surely not be neglected 
<A NAME="816"></A>by him.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR>And of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed?
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>Such, then, are the palms of victory which the gods give the 
<A NAME="820"></A>just?
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>That is my conviction.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>And what do they receive of men? Look at things as they really are, 
<A NAME="823"></A>and you will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners, who 
<A NAME="824"></A>run well from the starting-place to the goal but not back again from the 
<A NAME="825"></A>goal: they go off at a great pace, but in the end only look foolish, slinking 
<A NAME="826"></A>away with their ears draggling on their shoulders, and without a crown; 
<A NAME="827"></A>but the true runner comes to the finish and receives the prize and is crowned. 
<A NAME="828"></A>And this is the way with the just; he who endures to the end of every action 
<A NAME="829"></A>and occasion of his entire life has a good report and carries off the prize 
<A NAME="830"></A>which men have to bestow.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>And now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which 
<A NAME="833"></A>you were attributing to the fortunate unjust. I shall say of them, what 
<A NAME="834"></A>you were saying of the others, that as they grow older, they become rulers 
<A NAME="835"></A>in their own city if they care to be; they marry whom they like and give 
<A NAME="836"></A>in marriage to whom they will; all that you said of the others I now say 
<A NAME="837"></A>of these. And, on the other hand, of the unjust I say that the greater 
<A NAME="838"></A>number, even though they escape in their youth, are found out at last and 
<A NAME="839"></A>look foolish at the end of their course, and when they come to be old and 
<A NAME="840"></A>miserable are flouted alike by stranger and citizen; they are beaten and 
<A NAME="841"></A>then come those things unfit for ears polite, as you truly term them; they 
<A NAME="842"></A>will be racked and have their eyes burned out, as you were saying. And 
<A NAME="843"></A>you may suppose that I have repeated the remainder of your tale of horrors. 
<A NAME="844"></A>But will you let me assume, without reciting them, that these things are 
<A NAME="845"></A>true?
<A NAME="846"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said, what you say is true.
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>These, then, are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed 
<A NAME="848"></A>upon the just by gods and men in this present life, in addition to the 
<A NAME="849"></A>other good things which justice of herself provides.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; and they are fair and lasting.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>And yet, I said, all these are as nothing, either in number or greatness 
<A NAME="852"></A>in comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and unjust 
<A NAME="853"></A>after death. And you ought to hear them, and then both just and unjust 
<A NAME="854"></A>will have received from us a full payment of the debt which the argument 
<A NAME="855"></A>owes to them.
<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR>Speak, he said; there are few things which I would more gladly 
<A NAME="857"></A>hear.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR>Socrates
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR>Well, I said, I will tell you a tale; not one of the tales which 
<A NAME="860"></A>Odysseus tells to the hero Alcinous, yet this too is a tale of a hero, 
<A NAME="861"></A>Er the son of Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth. He was slain in battle, 
<A NAME="862"></A>and ten days afterwards, when the bodies of the dead were taken up already 
<A NAME="863"></A>in a state of corruption, his body was found unaffected by decay, and carried 
<A NAME="864"></A>away home to be buried. And on the twelfth day, as he was lying on the 
<A NAME="865"></A>funeral pile, he returned to life and told them what he had seen in the 
<A NAME="866"></A>other world. He said that when his soul left the body he went on a journey 
<A NAME="867"></A>with a great company, and that they came to a mysterious place at which 
<A NAME="868"></A>there were two openings in the earth; they were near together, and over 
<A NAME="869"></A>against them were two other openings in the heaven above. In the intermediate 
<A NAME="870"></A>space there were judges seated, who commanded the just, after they had 
<A NAME="871"></A>given judgment on them and had bound their sentences in front of them, 
<A NAME="872"></A>to ascend by the heavenly way on the right hand; and in like manner the 
<A NAME="873"></A>unjust were bidden by them to descend by the lower way on the left hand; 
<A NAME="874"></A>these also bore the symbols of their deeds, but fastened on their backs. 
<A NAME="875"></A>He drew near, and they told him that he was to be the messenger who would 
<A NAME="876"></A>carry the report of the other world to men, and they bade him hear and 
<A NAME="877"></A>see all that was to be heard and seen in that place. Then he beheld and 
<A NAME="878"></A>saw on one side the souls departing at either opening of heaven and earth 
<A NAME="879"></A>when sentence had been given on them; and at the two other openings other 
<A NAME="880"></A>souls, some ascending out of the earth dusty and worn with travel, some 
<A NAME="881"></A>descending out of heaven clean and bright. And arriving ever and anon they 
<A NAME="882"></A>seemed to have come from a long journey, and they went forth with gladness 
<A NAME="883"></A>into the meadow, where they encamped as at a festival; and those who knew 
<A NAME="884"></A>one another embraced and conversed, the souls which came from earth curiously 
<A NAME="885"></A>enquiring about the things above, and the souls which came from heaven 
<A NAME="886"></A>about the things beneath. And they told one another of what had happened 
<A NAME="887"></A>by the way, those from below weeping and sorrowing at the remembrance of 
<A NAME="888"></A>the things which they had endured and seen in their journey beneath the 
<A NAME="889"></A>earth (now the journey lasted a thousand years), while those from above 
<A NAME="890"></A>were describing heavenly delights and visions of inconceivable beauty. 
<A NAME="891"></A>The Story, Glaucon, would take too long to tell; but the sum was this: 
<A NAME="892"></A>--He said that for every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered 
<A NAME="893"></A>tenfold; or once in a hundred years --such being reckoned to be the length 
<A NAME="894"></A>of man's life, and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a thousand 
<A NAME="895"></A>years. If, for example, there were any who had been the cause of many deaths, 
<A NAME="896"></A>or had betrayed or enslaved cities or armies, or been guilty of any other 
<A NAME="897"></A>evil behaviour, for each and all of their offences they received punishment 
<A NAME="898"></A>ten times over, and the rewards of beneficence and justice and holiness 
<A NAME="899"></A>were in the same proportion. I need hardly repeat what he said concerning 
<A NAME="900"></A>young children dying almost as soon as they were born. Of piety and impiety 
<A NAME="901"></A>to gods and parents, and of murderers, there were retributions other and 
<A NAME="902"></A>greater far which he described. He mentioned that he was present when one 
<A NAME="903"></A>of the spirits asked another, 'Where is Ardiaeus the Great?' (Now this 
<A NAME="904"></A>Ardiaeus lived a thousand years before the time of Er: he had been the 
<A NAME="905"></A>tyrant of some city of Pamphylia, and had murdered his aged father and 
<A NAME="906"></A>his elder brother, and was said to have committed many other abominable 
<A NAME="907"></A>crimes.) The answer of the other spirit was: 'He comes not hither and will 
<A NAME="908"></A>never come. And this,' said he, 'was one of the dreadful sights which we 
<A NAME="909"></A>ourselves witnessed. We were at the mouth of the cavern, and, having completed 
<A NAME="910"></A>all our experiences, were about to reascend, when of a sudden Ardiaeus 
<A NAME="911"></A>appeared and several others, most of whom were tyrants; and there were 
<A NAME="912"></A>also besides the tyrants private individuals who had been great criminals: 
<A NAME="913"></A>they were just, as they fancied, about to return into the upper world, 
<A NAME="914"></A>but the mouth, instead of admitting them, gave a roar, whenever any of 
<A NAME="915"></A>these incurable sinners or some one who had not been sufficiently punished 
<A NAME="916"></A>tried to ascend; and then wild men of fiery aspect, who were standing by 
<A NAME="917"></A>and heard the sound, seized and carried them off; and Ardiaeus and others 
<A NAME="918"></A>they bound head and foot and hand, and threw them down and flayed them 
<A NAME="919"></A>with scourges, and dragged them along the road at the side, carding them 
<A NAME="920"></A>on thorns like wool, and declaring to the passers-by what were their crimes, 
<A NAME="921"></A>and that they were being taken away to be cast into hell.' And of all the 
<A NAME="922"></A>many terrors which they had endured, he said that there was none like the 
<A NAME="923"></A>terror which each of them felt at that moment, lest they should hear the 
<A NAME="924"></A>voice; and when there was silence, one by one they ascended with exceeding 
<A NAME="925"></A>joy. These, said Er, were the penalties and retributions, and there were 
<A NAME="926"></A>blessings as great.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR>Now when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven 
<A NAME="928"></A>days, on the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey, and, 
<A NAME="929"></A>on the fourth day after, he said that they came to a place where they could 
<A NAME="930"></A>see from above a line of light, straight as a column, extending right through 
<A NAME="931"></A>the whole heaven and through the earth, in colour resembling the rainbow, 
<A NAME="932"></A>only brighter and purer; another day's journey brought them to the place, 
<A NAME="933"></A>and there, in the midst of the light, they saw the ends of the chains of 
<A NAME="934"></A>heaven let down from above: for this light is the belt of heaven, and holds 
<A NAME="935"></A>together the circle of the universe, like the under-girders of a trireme. 
<A NAME="936"></A>From these ends is extended the spindle of Necessity, on which all the 
<A NAME="937"></A>revolutions turn. The shaft and hook of this spindle are made of steel, 
<A NAME="938"></A>and the whorl is made partly of steel and also partly of other materials. 
<A NAME="939"></A>Now the whorl is in form like the whorl used on earth; and the description 
<A NAME="940"></A>of it implied that there is one large hollow whorl which is quite scooped 
<A NAME="941"></A>out, and into this is fitted another lesser one, and another, and another, 
<A NAME="942"></A>and four others, making eight in all, like vessels which fit into one another; 
<A NAME="943"></A>the whorls show their edges on the upper side, and on their lower side 
<A NAME="944"></A>all together form one continuous whorl. This is pierced by the spindle, 
<A NAME="945"></A>which is driven home through the centre of the eighth. The first and outermost 
<A NAME="946"></A>whorl has the rim broadest, and the seven inner whorls are narrower, in 
<A NAME="947"></A>the following proportions --the sixth is next to the first in size, the 
<A NAME="948"></A>fourth next to the sixth; then comes the eighth; the seventh is fifth, 
<A NAME="949"></A>the fifth is sixth, the third is seventh, last and eighth comes the second. 
<A NAME="950"></A>The largest (of fixed stars) is spangled, and the seventh (or sun) is brightest; 
<A NAME="951"></A>the eighth (or moon) coloured by the reflected light of the seventh; the 
<A NAME="952"></A>second and fifth (Saturn and Mercury) are in colour like one another, and 
<A NAME="953"></A>yellower than the preceding; the third (Venus) has the whitest light; the 
<A NAME="954"></A>fourth (Mars) is reddish; the sixth (Jupiter) is in whiteness second. Now 
<A NAME="955"></A>the whole spindle has the same motion; but, as the whole revolves in one 
<A NAME="956"></A>direction, the seven inner circles move slowly in the other, and of these 
<A NAME="957"></A>the swiftest is the eighth; next in swiftness are the seventh, sixth, and 
<A NAME="958"></A>fifth, which move together; third in swiftness appeared to move according 
<A NAME="959"></A>to the law of this reversed motion the fourth; the third appeared fourth 
<A NAME="960"></A>and the second fifth. The spindle turns on the knees of Necessity; and 
<A NAME="961"></A>on the upper surface of each circle is a siren, who goes round with them, 
<A NAME="962"></A>hymning a single tone or note. The eight together form one harmony; and 
<A NAME="963"></A>round about, at equal intervals, there is another band, three in number, 
<A NAME="964"></A>each sitting upon her throne: these are the Fates, daughters of Necessity, 
<A NAME="965"></A>who are clothed in white robes and have chaplets upon their heads, Lachesis 
<A NAME="966"></A>and Clotho and Atropos, who accompany with their voices the harmony of 
<A NAME="967"></A>the sirens --Lachesis singing of the past, Clotho of the present, Atropos 
<A NAME="968"></A>of the future; Clotho from time to time assisting with a touch of her right 
<A NAME="969"></A>hand the revolution of the outer circle of the whorl or spindle, and Atropos 
<A NAME="970"></A>with her left hand touching and guiding the inner ones, and Lachesis laying 
<A NAME="971"></A>hold of either in turn, first with one hand and then with the 
<A NAME="972"></A>other.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR><BR>When Er and the spirits arrived, their duty was to go at once to 
<A NAME="974"></A>Lachesis; but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in order; 
<A NAME="975"></A>then he took from the knees of Lachesis lots and samples of lives, and 
<A NAME="976"></A>having mounted a high pulpit, spoke as follows: 'Hear the word of Lachesis, 
<A NAME="977"></A>the daughter of Necessity. Mortal souls, behold a new cycle of life and 
<A NAME="978"></A>mortality. Your genius will not be allotted to you, but you choose your 
<A NAME="979"></A>genius; and let him who draws the first lot have the first choice, and 
<A NAME="980"></A>the life which he chooses shall be his destiny. Virtue is free, and as 
<A NAME="981"></A>a man honours or dishonours her he will have more or less of her; the responsibility 
<A NAME="982"></A>is with the chooser --God is justified.' When the Interpreter had thus 
<A NAME="983"></A>spoken he scattered lots indifferently among them all, and each of them 
<A NAME="984"></A>took up the lot which fell near him, all but Er himself (he was not allowed), 
<A NAME="985"></A>and each as he took his lot perceived the number which he had obtained. 
<A NAME="986"></A>Then the Interpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives; 
<A NAME="987"></A>and there were many more lives than the souls present, and they were of 
<A NAME="988"></A>all sorts. There were lives of every animal and of man in every condition. 
<A NAME="989"></A>And there were tyrannies among them, some lasting out the tyrant's life, 
<A NAME="990"></A>others which broke off in the middle and came to an end in poverty and 
<A NAME="991"></A>exile and beggary; and there were lives of famous men, some who were famous 
<A NAME="992"></A>for their form and beauty as well as for their strength and success in 
<A NAME="993"></A>games, or, again, for their birth and the qualities of their ancestors; 
<A NAME="994"></A>and some who were the reverse of famous for the opposite qualities. And 
<A NAME="995"></A>of women likewise; there was not, however, any definite character them, 
<A NAME="996"></A>because the soul, when choosing a new life, must of necessity become different. 
<A NAME="997"></A>But there was every other quality, and the all mingled with one another, 
<A NAME="998"></A>and also with elements of wealth and poverty, and disease and health; and 
<A NAME="999"></A>there were mean states also. And here, my dear Glaucon, is the supreme 
<A NAME="1000"></A>peril of our human state; and therefore the utmost care should be taken. 
<A NAME="1001"></A>Let each one of us leave every other kind of knowledge and seek and follow 
<A NAME="1002"></A>one thing only, if peradventure he may be able to learn and may find some 
<A NAME="1003"></A>one who will make him able to learn and discern between good and evil, 
<A NAME="1004"></A>and so to choose always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity. 
<A NAME="1005"></A>He should consider the bearing of all these things which have been mentioned 
<A NAME="1006"></A>severally and collectively upon virtue; he should know what the effect 
<A NAME="1007"></A>of beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a particular soul, 
<A NAME="1008"></A>and what are the good and evil consequences of noble and humble birth, 
<A NAME="1009"></A>of private and public station, of strength and weakness, of cleverness 
<A NAME="1010"></A>and dullness, and of all the soul, and the operation of them when conjoined; 
<A NAME="1011"></A>he will then look at the nature of the soul, and from the consideration 
<A NAME="1012"></A>of all these qualities he will be able to determine which is the better 
<A NAME="1013"></A>and which is the worse; and so he will choose, giving the name of evil 
<A NAME="1014"></A>to the life which will make his soul more unjust, and good to the life 
<A NAME="1015"></A>which will make his soul more just; all else he will disregard. For we 
<A NAME="1016"></A>have seen and know that this is the best choice both in life and after 
<A NAME="1017"></A>death. A man must take with him into the world below an adamantine faith 
<A NAME="1018"></A>in truth and right, that there too he may be undazzled by the desire of 
<A NAME="1019"></A>wealth or the other allurements of evil, lest, coming upon tyrannies and 
<A NAME="1020"></A>similar villainies, he do irremediable wrongs to others and suffer yet 
<A NAME="1021"></A>worse himself; but let him know how to choose the mean and avoid the extremes 
<A NAME="1022"></A>on either side, as far as possible, not only in this life but in all that 
<A NAME="1023"></A>which is to come. For this is the way of happiness.
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR><BR>And according to the report of the messenger from the other world 
<A NAME="1025"></A>this was what the prophet said at the time: 'Even for the last comer, if 
<A NAME="1026"></A>he chooses wisely and will live diligently, there is appointed a happy 
<A NAME="1027"></A>and not undesirable existence. Let not him who chooses first be careless, 
<A NAME="1028"></A>and let not the last despair.' And when he had spoken, he who had the first 
<A NAME="1029"></A>choice came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny; his mind 
<A NAME="1030"></A>having been darkened by folly and sensuality, he had not thought out the 
<A NAME="1031"></A>whole matter before he chose, and did not at first sight perceive that 
<A NAME="1032"></A>he was fated, among other evils, to devour his own children. But when he 
<A NAME="1033"></A>had time to reflect, and saw what was in the lot, he began to beat his 
<A NAME="1034"></A>breast and lament over his choice, forgetting the proclamation of the prophet; 
<A NAME="1035"></A>for, instead of throwing the blame of his misfortune on himself, he accused 
<A NAME="1036"></A>chance and the gods, and everything rather than himself. Now he was one 
<A NAME="1037"></A>of those who came from heaven, and in a former life had dwelt in a well-ordered 
<A NAME="1038"></A>State, but his virtue was a matter of habit only, and he had no philosophy. 
<A NAME="1039"></A>And it was true of others who were similarly overtaken, that the greater 
<A NAME="1040"></A>number of them came from heaven and therefore they had never been schooled 
<A NAME="1041"></A>by trial, whereas the pilgrims who came from earth, having themselves suffered 
<A NAME="1042"></A>and seen others suffer, were not in a hurry to choose. And owing to this 
<A NAME="1043"></A>inexperience of theirs, and also because the lot was a chance, many of 
<A NAME="1044"></A>the souls exchanged a good destiny for an evil or an evil for a good. For 
<A NAME="1045"></A>if a man had always on his arrival in this world dedicated himself from 
<A NAME="1046"></A>the first to sound philosophy, and had been moderately fortunate in the 
<A NAME="1047"></A>number of the lot, he might, as the messenger reported, be happy here, 
<A NAME="1048"></A>and also his journey to another life and return to this, instead of being 
<A NAME="1049"></A>rough and underground, would be smooth and heavenly. Most curious, he said, 
<A NAME="1050"></A>was the spectacle --sad and laughable and strange; for the choice of the 
<A NAME="1051"></A>souls was in most cases based on their experience of a previous life. There 
<A NAME="1052"></A>he saw the soul which had once been Orpheus choosing the life of a swan 
<A NAME="1053"></A>out of enmity to the race of women, hating to be born of a woman because 
<A NAME="1054"></A>they had been his murderers; he beheld also the soul of Thamyras choosing 
<A NAME="1055"></A>the life of a nightingale; birds, on the other hand, like the swan and 
<A NAME="1056"></A>other musicians, wanting to be men. The soul which obtained the twentieth 
<A NAME="1057"></A>lot chose the life of a lion, and this was the soul of Ajax the son of 
<A NAME="1058"></A>Telamon, who would not be a man, remembering the injustice which was done 
<A NAME="1059"></A>him the judgment about the arms. The next was Agamemnon, who took the life 
<A NAME="1060"></A>of an eagle, because, like Ajax, he hated human nature by reason of his 
<A NAME="1061"></A>sufferings. About the middle came the lot of Atalanta; she, seeing the 
<A NAME="1062"></A>great fame of an athlete, was unable to resist the temptation: and after 
<A NAME="1063"></A>her there followed the soul of Epeus the son of Panopeus passing into the 
<A NAME="1064"></A>nature of a woman cunning in the arts; and far away among the last who 
<A NAME="1065"></A>chose, the soul of the jester Thersites was putting on the form of a monkey. 
<A NAME="1066"></A>There came also the soul of Odysseus having yet to make a choice, and his 
<A NAME="1067"></A>lot happened to be the last of them all. Now the recollection of former 
<A NAME="1068"></A>tolls had disenchanted him of ambition, and he went about for a considerable 
<A NAME="1069"></A>time in search of the life of a private man who had no cares; he had some 
<A NAME="1070"></A>difficulty in finding this, which was lying about and had been neglected 
<A NAME="1071"></A>by everybody else; and when he saw it, he said that he would have done 
<A NAME="1072"></A>the had his lot been first instead of last, and that he was delighted to 
<A NAME="1073"></A>have it. And not only did men pass into animals, but I must also mention 
<A NAME="1074"></A>that there were animals tame and wild who changed into one another and 
<A NAME="1075"></A>into corresponding human natures --the good into the gentle and the evil 
<A NAME="1076"></A>into the savage, in all sorts of combinations.
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR><BR>All the souls had now chosen their lives, and they went in the 
<A NAME="1078"></A>order of their choice to Lachesis, who sent with them the genius whom they 
<A NAME="1079"></A>had severally chosen, to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller 
<A NAME="1080"></A>of the choice: this genius led the souls first to Clotho, and drew them 
<A NAME="1081"></A>within the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand, thus ratifying 
<A NAME="1082"></A>the destiny of each; and then, when they were fastened to this, carried 
<A NAME="1083"></A>them to Atropos, who spun the threads and made them irreversible, whence 
<A NAME="1084"></A>without turning round they passed beneath the throne of Necessity; and 
<A NAME="1085"></A>when they had all passed, they marched on in a scorching heat to the plain 
<A NAME="1086"></A>of Forgetfulness, which was a barren waste destitute of trees and verdure; 
<A NAME="1087"></A>and then towards evening they encamped by the river of Unmindfulness, whose 
<A NAME="1088"></A>water no vessel can hold; of this they were all obliged to drink a certain 
<A NAME="1089"></A>quantity, and those who were not saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary; 
<A NAME="1090"></A>and each one as he drank forgot all things. Now after they had gone to 
<A NAME="1091"></A>rest, about the middle of the night there was a thunderstorm and earthquake, 
<A NAME="1092"></A>and then in an instant they were driven upwards in all manner of ways to 
<A NAME="1093"></A>their birth, like stars shooting. He himself was hindered from drinking 
<A NAME="1094"></A>the water. But in what manner or by what means he returned to the body 
<A NAME="1095"></A>he could not say; only, in the morning, awaking suddenly, he found himself 
<A NAME="1096"></A>lying on the pyre.
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR><BR>And thus, Glaucon, the tale has been saved and has not perished, 
<A NAME="1098"></A>and will save us if we are obedient to the word spoken; and we shall pass 
<A NAME="1099"></A>safely over the river of Forgetfulness and our soul will not be defiled. 
<A NAME="1100"></A>Wherefore my counsel is that we hold fast ever to the heavenly way and 
<A NAME="1101"></A>follow after justice and virtue always, considering that the soul is immortal 
<A NAME="1102"></A>and able to endure every sort of good and every sort of evil. Thus shall 
<A NAME="1103"></A>we live dear to one another and to the gods, both while remaining here 
<A NAME="1104"></A>and when, like conquerors in the games who go round to gather gifts, we 
<A NAME="1105"></A>receive our reward. And it shall be well with us both in this life and 
<A NAME="1106"></A>in the pilgrimage of a thousand years which we have been 
<A NAME="1107"></A>describing.
