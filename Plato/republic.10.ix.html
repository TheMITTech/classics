<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Socrates - ADEIMANTUS
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Last of all comes the tyrannical man; about whom we have once more 
<A NAME="12"></A>to ask, how is he formed out of the democratical? and how does he live, 
<A NAME="13"></A>in happiness or in misery?
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, he is the only one remaining.
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>There is, however, I said, a previous question which remains 
<A NAME="16"></A>unanswered.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>What question?
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>I do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number 
<A NAME="19"></A>of the appetites, and until this is accomplished the enquiry will always 
<A NAME="20"></A>be confused.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>Well, he said, it is not too late to supply the 
<A NAME="22"></A>omission.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Very true, I said; and observe the point which I want to understand: 
<A NAME="24"></A>Certain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites I conceive to be unlawful; 
<A NAME="25"></A>every one appears to have them, but in some persons they are controlled 
<A NAME="26"></A>by the laws and by reason, and the better desires prevail over them-either 
<A NAME="27"></A>they are wholly banished or they become few and weak; while in the case 
<A NAME="28"></A>of others they are stronger, and there are more of them.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>Which appetites do you mean?
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>I mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling 
<A NAME="31"></A>power is asleep; then the wild beast within us, gorged with meat or drink, 
<A NAME="32"></A>starts up and having shaken off sleep, goes forth to satisfy his desires; 
<A NAME="33"></A>and there is no conceivable folly or crime --not excepting incest or any 
<A NAME="34"></A>other unnatural union, or parricide, or the eating of forbidden food --which 
<A NAME="35"></A>at such a time, when he has parted company with all shame and sense, a 
<A NAME="36"></A>man may not be ready to commit.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>Most true, he said.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>But when a man's pulse is healthy and temperate, and when before going 
<A NAME="39"></A>to sleep he has awakened his rational powers, and fed them on noble thoughts 
<A NAME="40"></A>and enquiries, collecting himself in meditation; after having first indulged 
<A NAME="41"></A>his appetites neither too much nor too little, but just enough to lay them 
<A NAME="42"></A>to sleep, and prevent them and their enjoyments and pains from interfering 
<A NAME="43"></A>with the higher principle --which he leaves in the solitude of pure abstraction, 
<A NAME="44"></A>free to contemplate and aspire to the knowledge of the unknown, whether 
<A NAME="45"></A>in past, present, or future: when again he has allayed the passionate element, 
<A NAME="46"></A>if he has a quarrel against any one --I say, when, after pacifying the 
<A NAME="47"></A>two irrational principles, he rouses up the third, which is reason, before 
<A NAME="48"></A>he takes his rest, then, as you know, he attains truth most nearly, and 
<A NAME="49"></A>is least likely to be the sport of fantastic and lawless 
<A NAME="50"></A>visions.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>I quite agree.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>In saying this I have been running into a digression; but the point 
<A NAME="53"></A>which I desire to note is that in all of us, even in good men, there is 
<A NAME="54"></A>a lawless wild-beast nature, which peers out in sleep. Pray, consider whether 
<A NAME="55"></A>I am right, and you agree with me.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I agree.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>And now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic 
<A NAME="58"></A>man. He was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under 
<A NAME="59"></A>a miserly parent, who encouraged the saving appetites in him, but discountenanced 
<A NAME="60"></A>the unnecessary, which aim only at amusement and ornament?
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>And then he got into the company of a more refined, licentious sort 
<A NAME="63"></A>of people, and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite 
<A NAME="64"></A>extreme from an abhorrence of his father's meanness. At last, being a better 
<A NAME="65"></A>man than his corruptors, he was drawn in both directions until he halted 
<A NAME="66"></A>midway and led a life, not of vulgar and slavish passion, but of what he 
<A NAME="67"></A>deemed moderate indulgence in various pleasures. After this manner the 
<A NAME="68"></A>democrat was generated out of the oligarch?
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; that was our view of him, and is so 
<A NAME="70"></A>still.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>And now, I said, years will have passed away, and you must conceive 
<A NAME="72"></A>this man, such as he is, to have a son, who is brought up in his father's 
<A NAME="73"></A>principles.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>I can imagine him.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son which 
<A NAME="76"></A>has already happened to the father: --he is drawn into a perfectly lawless 
<A NAME="77"></A>life, which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty; and his father and 
<A NAME="78"></A>friends take part with his moderate desires, and the opposite party assist 
<A NAME="79"></A>the opposite ones. As soon as these dire magicians and tyrant-makers find 
<A NAME="80"></A>that they are losing their hold on him, they contrive to implant in him 
<A NAME="81"></A>a master passion, to be lord over his idle and spendthrift lusts --a sort 
<A NAME="82"></A>of monstrous winged drone --that is the only image which will adequately 
<A NAME="83"></A>describe him.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that is the only adequate image of 
<A NAME="85"></A>him.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>And when his other lusts, amid clouds of incense and perfumes and garlands 
<A NAME="87"></A>and wines, and all the pleasures of a dissolute life, now let loose, come 
<A NAME="88"></A>buzzing around him, nourishing to the utmost the sting of desire which 
<A NAME="89"></A>they implant in his drone-like nature, then at last this lord of the soul, 
<A NAME="90"></A>having Madness for the captain of his guard, breaks out into a frenzy: 
<A NAME="91"></A>and if he finds in himself any good opinions or appetites in process of 
<A NAME="92"></A>formation, and there is in him any sense of shame remaining, to these better 
<A NAME="93"></A>principles he puts an end, and casts them forth until he has purged away 
<A NAME="94"></A>temperance and brought in madness to the full.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that is the way in which the tyrannical man is 
<A NAME="96"></A>generated.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a 
<A NAME="98"></A>tyrant?
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>I should not wonder.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Further, I said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a 
<A NAME="101"></A>tyrant?
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>He has.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>And you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind, 
<A NAME="104"></A>will fancy that he is able to rule, not only over men, but also over the 
<A NAME="105"></A>gods?
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>That he will.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>And the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being 
<A NAME="108"></A>when, either under the influence of nature, or habit, or both, he becomes 
<A NAME="109"></A>drunken, lustful, passionate? O my friend, is not that 
<A NAME="110"></A>so?
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>Assuredly.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Such is the man and such is his origin. And next, how does he 
<A NAME="113"></A>live?
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Suppose, as people facetiously say, you were to tell 
<A NAME="115"></A>me.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>I imagine, I said, at the next step in his progress, that there will 
<A NAME="117"></A>be feasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans, and all that sort 
<A NAME="118"></A>of thing; Love is the lord of the house within him, and orders all the 
<A NAME="119"></A>concerns of his soul.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>That is certain.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Yes; and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable, 
<A NAME="122"></A>and their demands are many.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>They are indeed, he said.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>His revenues, if he has any, are soon spent.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Then comes debt and the cutting down of his property.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>When he has nothing left, must not his desires, crowding in the nest 
<A NAME="129"></A>like young ravens, be crying aloud for food; and he, goaded on by them, 
<A NAME="130"></A>and especially by love himself, who is in a manner the captain of them, 
<A NAME="131"></A>is in a frenzy, and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil 
<A NAME="132"></A>of his property, in order that he may gratify them?
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that is sure to be the case.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>He must have money, no matter how, if he is to escape horrid pains 
<A NAME="135"></A>and pangs.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>He must.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>And as in himself there was a succession of pleasures, and the new 
<A NAME="138"></A>got the better of the old and took away their rights, so he being younger 
<A NAME="139"></A>will claim to have more than his father and his mother, and if he has spent 
<A NAME="140"></A>his own share of the property, he will take a slice of 
<A NAME="141"></A>theirs.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>No doubt he will.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>And if his parents will not give way, then he will try first of all 
<A NAME="144"></A>to cheat and deceive them.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>And if he fails, then he will use force and plunder 
<A NAME="147"></A>them.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Yes, probably.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>And if the old man and woman fight for their own, what then, my friend? 
<A NAME="150"></A>Will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over 
<A NAME="151"></A>them?
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>Nay, he said, I should not feel at all comfortable about his 
<A NAME="153"></A>parents.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>But, O heavens! Adeimantus, on account of some newfangled love 
<A NAME="155"></A>of a harlot, who is anything but a necessary connection, can you believe 
<A NAME="156"></A>that he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary 
<A NAME="157"></A>to his very existence, and would place her under the authority of the other, 
<A NAME="158"></A>when she is brought under the same roof with her; or that, under like circumstances, 
<A NAME="159"></A>he would do the same to his withered old father, first and most indispensable 
<A NAME="160"></A>of friends, for the sake of some newly found blooming youth who is the 
<A NAME="161"></A>reverse of indispensable?
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>Yes, indeed, he said; I believe that he would.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Truly, then, I said, a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and 
<A NAME="164"></A>mother.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>He is indeed, he replied.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>He first takes their property, and when that falls, and pleasures are 
<A NAME="167"></A>beginning to swarm in the hive of his soul, then he breaks into a house, 
<A NAME="168"></A>or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer; next he proceeds to clear 
<A NAME="169"></A>a temple. Meanwhile the old opinions which he had when a child, and which 
<A NAME="170"></A>gave judgment about good and evil, are overthrown by those others which 
<A NAME="171"></A>have just been emancipated, and are now the bodyguard of love and share 
<A NAME="172"></A>his empire. These in his democratic days, when he was still subject to 
<A NAME="173"></A>the laws and to his father, were only let loose in the dreams of sleep. 
<A NAME="174"></A>But now that he is under the dominion of love, he becomes always and in 
<A NAME="175"></A>waking reality what he was then very rarely and in a dream only; he will 
<A NAME="176"></A>commit the foulest murder, or eat forbidden food, or be guilty of any other 
<A NAME="177"></A>horrid act. Love is his tyrant, and lives lordly in him and lawlessly, 
<A NAME="178"></A>and being himself a king, leads him on, as a tyrant leads a State, to the 
<A NAME="179"></A>performance of any reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and the 
<A NAME="180"></A>rabble of his associates, whether those whom evil communications have brought 
<A NAME="181"></A>in from without, or those whom he himself has allowed to break loose within 
<A NAME="182"></A>him by reason of a similar evil nature in himself. Have we not here a picture 
<A NAME="183"></A>of his way of life?
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>Yes, indeed, he said.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>And if there are only a few of them in the State, the rest of the people 
<A NAME="186"></A>are well disposed, they go away and become the bodyguard or mercenary soldiers 
<A NAME="187"></A>of some other tyrant who may probably want them for a war; and if there 
<A NAME="188"></A>is no war, they stay at home and do many little pieces of mischief in the 
<A NAME="189"></A>city.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>What sort of mischief?
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>For example, they are the thieves, burglars, cutpurses, footpads, robbers 
<A NAME="192"></A>of temples, man-stealers of the community; or if they are able to speak 
<A NAME="193"></A>they turn informers, and bear false witness, and take 
<A NAME="194"></A>bribes.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>A small catalogue of evils, even if the perpetrators of them are 
<A NAME="196"></A>few in number.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said; but small and great are comparative terms, and all 
<A NAME="198"></A>these things, in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a State, do 
<A NAME="199"></A>not come within a thousand miles of the tyrant; when this noxious class 
<A NAME="200"></A>and their followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength, 
<A NAME="201"></A>assisted by the infatuation of the people, they choose from among themselves 
<A NAME="202"></A>the one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul, and him they create 
<A NAME="203"></A>their tyrant.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, and he will be the most fit to be a 
<A NAME="205"></A>tyrant.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>If the people yield, well and good; but if they resist him, as he began 
<A NAME="207"></A>by beating his own father and mother, so now, if he has the power, he beats 
<A NAME="208"></A>them, and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland, as the Cretans 
<A NAME="209"></A>say, in subjection to his young retainers whom he has introduced to be 
<A NAME="210"></A>their rulers and masters. This is the end of his passions and 
<A NAME="211"></A>desires.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>When such men are only private individuals and before they get power, 
<A NAME="214"></A>this is their character; they associate entirely with their own flatterers 
<A NAME="215"></A>or ready tools; or if they want anything from anybody, they in their turn 
<A NAME="216"></A>are equally ready to bow down before them: they profess every sort of affection 
<A NAME="217"></A>for them; but when they have gained their point they know them no 
<A NAME="218"></A>more.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>Yes, truly.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>They are always either the masters or servants and never the friends 
<A NAME="221"></A>of anybody; the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or 
<A NAME="222"></A>friendship.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>And may we not rightly call such men treacherous?
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>No question.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Also they are utterly unjust, if we were right in our notion of 
<A NAME="227"></A>justice?
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, and we were perfectly right.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Let us then sum up in a word, I said, the character of the worst man: 
<A NAME="230"></A>he is the waking reality of what we dreamed.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>Most true.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>And this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule, and 
<A NAME="233"></A>the longer he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>Socrates - GLAUCON
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>That is certain, said Glaucon, taking his turn to 
<A NAME="236"></A>answer.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>And will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest, be also the 
<A NAME="238"></A>most miserable? and he who has tyrannized longest and most, most continually 
<A NAME="239"></A>and truly miserable; although this may not be the opinion of men in 
<A NAME="240"></A>general?
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, inevitably.
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>And must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical, State, and 
<A NAME="243"></A>the democratical man like the democratical State; and the same of the 
<A NAME="244"></A>others?
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>And as State is to State in virtue and happiness, so is man in relation 
<A NAME="247"></A>to man?
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>To be sure.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Then comparing our original city, which was under a king, and the city 
<A NAME="250"></A>which is under a tyrant, how do they stand as to virtue?
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>They are the opposite extremes, he said, for one is the very best 
<A NAME="252"></A>and the other is the very worst.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>There can be no mistake, I said, as to which is which, and therefore 
<A NAME="254"></A>I will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision about 
<A NAME="255"></A>their relative happiness and misery. And here we must not allow ourselves 
<A NAME="256"></A>to be panic-stricken at the apparition of the tyrant, who is only a unit 
<A NAME="257"></A>and may perhaps have a few retainers about him; but let us go as we ought 
<A NAME="258"></A>into every corner of the city and look all about, and then we will give 
<A NAME="259"></A>our opinion.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>A fair invitation, he replied; and I see, as every one must, that 
<A NAME="261"></A>a tyranny is the wretchedest form of government, and the rule of a king 
<A NAME="262"></A>the happiest.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>And in estimating the men too, may I not fairly make a like request, 
<A NAME="264"></A>that I should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through human 
<A NAME="265"></A>nature? He must not be like a child who looks at the outside and is dazzled 
<A NAME="266"></A>at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to the beholder, 
<A NAME="267"></A>but let him be one who has a clear insight. May I suppose that the judgment 
<A NAME="268"></A>is given in the hearing of us all by one who is able to judge, and has 
<A NAME="269"></A>dwelt in the same place with him, and been present at his dally life and 
<A NAME="270"></A>known him in his family relations, where he may be seen stripped of his 
<A NAME="271"></A>tragedy attire, and again in the hour of public danger --he shall tell 
<A NAME="272"></A>us about the happiness and misery of the tyrant when compared with other 
<A NAME="273"></A>men?
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>That again, he said, is a very fair proposal.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Shall I assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and 
<A NAME="276"></A>have before now met with such a person? We shall then have some one who 
<A NAME="277"></A>will answer our enquiries.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>By all means.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>Let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the 
<A NAME="280"></A>State; bearing this in mind, and glancing in turn from one to the other 
<A NAME="281"></A>of them, will you tell me their respective conditions?
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean? he asked.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Beginning with the State, I replied, would you say that a city which 
<A NAME="284"></A>is governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved?
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>No city, he said, can be more completely enslaved.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>And yet, as you see, there are freemen as well as masters in such a 
<A NAME="287"></A>State?
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, I see that there are --a few; but the people, speaking 
<A NAME="289"></A>generally, and the best of them, are miserably degraded and 
<A NAME="290"></A>enslaved.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>Then if the man is like the State, I said, must not the same rule 
<A NAME="292"></A>prevail? his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity --the best elements 
<A NAME="293"></A>in him are enslaved; and there is a small ruling part, which is also the 
<A NAME="294"></A>worst and maddest.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>Inevitably.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>And would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman, 
<A NAME="297"></A>or of a slave?
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>He has the soul of a slave, in my opinion.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>And the State which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable 
<A NAME="300"></A>of acting voluntarily?
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>Utterly incapable.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>And also the soul which is under a tyrant (I am speaking of the soul 
<A NAME="303"></A>taken as a whole) is least capable of doing what she desires; there is 
<A NAME="304"></A>a gadfly which goads her, and she is full of trouble and 
<A NAME="305"></A>remorse?
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>And is the city which is under a tyrant rich or 
<A NAME="308"></A>poor?
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Poor.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>And the tyrannical soul must be always poor and 
<A NAME="311"></A>insatiable?
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>And must not such a State and such a man be always full of 
<A NAME="314"></A>fear?
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>Yes, indeed.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Is there any State in which you will find more of lamentation and sorrow 
<A NAME="317"></A>and groaning and pain?
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>And is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery 
<A NAME="320"></A>than in the tyrannical man, who is in a fury of passions and 
<A NAME="321"></A>desires?
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Reflecting upon these and similar evils, you held the tyrannical State 
<A NAME="324"></A>to be the most miserable of States?
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>And I was right, he said.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Certainly, I said. And when you see the same evils in the tyrannical 
<A NAME="327"></A>man, what do you say of him?
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>I say that he is by far the most miserable of all 
<A NAME="329"></A>men.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>There, I said, I think that you are beginning to go 
<A NAME="331"></A>wrong.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>What do you mean?
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>I do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of 
<A NAME="334"></A>misery.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>Then who is more miserable?
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>One of whom I am about to speak.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Who is that?
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>He who is of a tyrannical nature, and instead of leading a private 
<A NAME="339"></A>life has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public 
<A NAME="340"></A>tyrant.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>From what has been said, I gather that you are 
<A NAME="342"></A>right.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Yes, I replied, but in this high argument you should be a little more 
<A NAME="344"></A>certain, and should not conjecture only; for of all questions, this respecting 
<A NAME="345"></A>good and evil is the greatest.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>Let me then offer you an illustration, which may, I think, throw a 
<A NAME="348"></A>light upon this subject.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>What is your illustration?
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>The case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves: from 
<A NAME="351"></A>them you may form an idea of the tyrant's condition, for they both have 
<A NAME="352"></A>slaves; the only difference is that he has more slaves.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that is the difference.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>You know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from 
<A NAME="355"></A>their servants?
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>What should they fear?
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><B>Nothing.</B> But do you observe the reason of 
<A NAME="358"></A>this?
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Yes; the reason is, that the whole city is leagued together for the 
<A NAME="360"></A>protection of each individual.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>Very true, I said. But imagine one of these owners, the master 
<A NAME="362"></A>say of some fifty slaves, together with his family and property and slaves, 
<A NAME="363"></A>carried off by a god into the wilderness, where there are no freemen to 
<A NAME="364"></A>help him --will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and 
<A NAME="365"></A>children should be put to death by his slaves?
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, he will be in the utmost fear.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>The time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of 
<A NAME="368"></A>his slaves, and make many promises to them of freedom and other things, 
<A NAME="369"></A>much against his will --he will have to cajole his own 
<A NAME="370"></A>servants.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that will be the only way of saving 
<A NAME="372"></A>himself.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>And suppose the same god, who carried him away, to surround him with 
<A NAME="374"></A>neighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another, and 
<A NAME="375"></A>who, if they could catch the offender, would take his 
<A NAME="376"></A>life?
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>His case will be still worse, if you suppose him to be everywhere 
<A NAME="378"></A>surrounded and watched by enemies.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>And is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be 
<A NAME="380"></A>bound --he who being by nature such as we have described, is full of all 
<A NAME="381"></A>sorts of fears and lusts? His soul is dainty and greedy, and yet alone, 
<A NAME="382"></A>of all men in the city, he is never allowed to go on a journey, or to see 
<A NAME="383"></A>the things which other freemen desire to see, but he lives in his hole 
<A NAME="384"></A>like a woman hidden in the house, and is jealous of any other citizen who 
<A NAME="385"></A>goes into foreign parts and sees anything of interest.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>And amid evils such as these will not he who is ill-governed in his 
<A NAME="388"></A>own person --the tyrannical man, I mean --whom you just now decided to 
<A NAME="389"></A>be the most miserable of all --will not he be yet more miserable when, 
<A NAME="390"></A>instead of leading a private life, he is constrained by fortune to be a 
<A NAME="391"></A>public tyrant? He has to be master of others when he is not master of himself: 
<A NAME="392"></A>he is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his life, 
<A NAME="393"></A>not in retirement, but fighting and combating with other 
<A NAME="394"></A>men.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, the similitude is most exact.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>Is not his case utterly miserable? and does not the actual tyrant lead 
<A NAME="397"></A>a worse life than he whose life you determined to be the 
<A NAME="398"></A>worst?
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>He who is the real tyrant, whatever men may think, is the real slave, 
<A NAME="401"></A>and is obliged to practise the greatest adulation and servility, and to 
<A NAME="402"></A>be the flatterer of the vilest of mankind. He has desires which he is utterly 
<A NAME="403"></A>unable to satisfy, and has more wants than any one, and is truly poor, 
<A NAME="404"></A>if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him: all his life long he 
<A NAME="405"></A>is beset with fear and is full of convulsions, and distractions, even as 
<A NAME="406"></A>the State which he resembles: and surely the resemblance 
<A NAME="407"></A>holds?
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Moreover, as we were saying before, he grows worse from having power: 
<A NAME="410"></A>he becomes and is of necessity more jealous, more faithless, more unjust, 
<A NAME="411"></A>more friendless, more impious, than he was at first; he is the purveyor 
<A NAME="412"></A>and cherisher of every sort of vice, and the consequence is that he is 
<A NAME="413"></A>supremely miserable, and that he makes everybody else as miserable as 
<A NAME="414"></A>himself.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>No man of any sense will dispute your words.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>Come then, I said, and as the general umpire in theatrical contests 
<A NAME="417"></A>proclaims the result, do you also decide who in your opinion is first in 
<A NAME="418"></A>the scale of happiness, and who second, and in what order the others follow: 
<A NAME="419"></A>there are five of them in all --they are the royal, timocratical, oligarchical, 
<A NAME="420"></A>democratical, tyrannical.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>The decision will be easily given, he replied; they shall be choruses 
<A NAME="422"></A>coming on the stage, and I must judge them in the order in which they enter, 
<A NAME="423"></A>by the criterion of virtue and vice, happiness and misery.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>Need we hire a herald, or shall I announce, that the son of Ariston 
<A NAME="425"></A>(the best) has decided that the best and justest is also the happiest, 
<A NAME="426"></A>and that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself; and 
<A NAME="427"></A>that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable, and that 
<A NAME="428"></A>this is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the greatest 
<A NAME="429"></A>tyrant of his State?
<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR>Make the proclamation yourself, he said.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>And shall I add, 'whether seen or unseen by gods and 
<A NAME="432"></A>men'?
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Let the words be added.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Then this, I said, will be our first proof; and there is another, which 
<A NAME="435"></A>may also have some weight.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>What is that?
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>The second proof is derived from the nature of the soul: seeing that 
<A NAME="438"></A>the individual soul, like the State, has been divided by us into three 
<A NAME="439"></A>principles, the division may, I think, furnish a new 
<A NAME="440"></A>demonstration.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>Of what nature?
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>It seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures correspond; 
<A NAME="443"></A>also three desires and governing powers.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>How do you mean? he said.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>There is one principle with which, as we were saying, a man learns, 
<A NAME="446"></A>another with which he is angry; the third, having many forms, has no special 
<A NAME="447"></A>name, but is denoted by the general term appetitive, from the extraordinary 
<A NAME="448"></A>strength and vehemence of the desires of eating and drinking and the other 
<A NAME="449"></A>sensual appetites which are the main elements of it; also money-loving, 
<A NAME="450"></A>because such desires are generally satisfied by the help of 
<A NAME="451"></A>money.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>That is true, he said.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>If we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were 
<A NAME="454"></A>concerned with gain, we should then be able to fall back on a single notion; 
<A NAME="455"></A>and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul as loving 
<A NAME="456"></A>gain or money.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>I agree with you.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Again, is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering 
<A NAME="459"></A>and getting fame?
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious --would the term be 
<A NAME="462"></A>suitable?
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>Extremely suitable.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>On the other hand, every one sees that the principle of knowledge is 
<A NAME="465"></A>wholly directed to the truth, and cares less than either of the others 
<A NAME="466"></A>for gain or fame.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>Far less.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>'Lover of wisdom,' 'lover of knowledge,' are titles which we may fitly 
<A NAME="469"></A>apply to that part of the soul?
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>One principle prevails in the souls of one class of men, another in 
<A NAME="472"></A>others, as may happen?
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of men --lovers 
<A NAME="475"></A>of wisdom, lovers of honour, lovers of gain?
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>And there are three kinds of pleasure, which are their several 
<A NAME="478"></A>objects?
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Now, if you examine the three classes of men, and ask of them in turn 
<A NAME="481"></A>which of their lives is pleasantest, each will be found praising his own 
<A NAME="482"></A>and depreciating that of others: the money-maker will contrast the vanity 
<A NAME="483"></A>of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid advantages 
<A NAME="484"></A>of gold and silver?
<A NAME="485"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>And the lover of honour --what will be his opinion? Will he not think 
<A NAME="487"></A>that the pleasure of riches is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning, 
<A NAME="488"></A>if it brings no distinction, is all smoke and nonsense to 
<A NAME="489"></A>him?
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>And are we to suppose, I said, that the philosopher sets any value 
<A NAME="492"></A>on other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth, 
<A NAME="493"></A>and in that pursuit abiding, ever learning, not so far indeed from the 
<A NAME="494"></A>heaven of pleasure? Does he not call the other pleasures necessary, under 
<A NAME="495"></A>the idea that if there were no necessity for them, he would rather not 
<A NAME="496"></A>have them?
<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR>There can be no doubt of that, he replied.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Since, then, the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in 
<A NAME="499"></A>dispute, and the question is not which life is more or less honourable, 
<A NAME="500"></A>or better or worse, but which is the more pleasant or painless --how shall 
<A NAME="501"></A>we know who speaks truly?
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>I cannot myself tell, he said.
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>Well, but what ought to be the criterion? Is any better than experience 
<A NAME="504"></A>and wisdom and reason?
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>There cannot be a better, he said.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Then, I said, reflect. Of the three individuals, which has the greatest 
<A NAME="507"></A>experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated? Has the lover of gain, 
<A NAME="508"></A>in learning the nature of essential truth, greater experience of the pleasure 
<A NAME="509"></A>of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of 
<A NAME="510"></A>gain?
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>The philosopher, he replied, has greatly the advantage; for he 
<A NAME="512"></A>has of necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his 
<A NAME="513"></A>childhood upwards: but the lover of gain in all his experience has not 
<A NAME="514"></A>of necessity tasted --or, I should rather say, even had he desired, could 
<A NAME="515"></A>hardly have tasted --the sweetness of learning and knowing 
<A NAME="516"></A>truth.
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>Then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of 
<A NAME="518"></A>gain, for he has a double experience?
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>Yes, very great.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the 
<A NAME="521"></A>lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>Nay, he said, all three are honoured in proportion as they attain 
<A NAME="523"></A>their object; for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike 
<A NAME="524"></A>have their crowd of admirers, and as they all receive honour they all have 
<A NAME="525"></A>experience of the pleasures of honour; but the delight which is to be found 
<A NAME="526"></A>in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher 
<A NAME="527"></A>only.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>His experience, then, will enable him to judge better than any 
<A NAME="529"></A>one?
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Far better.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>And he is the only one who has wisdom as well as 
<A NAME="532"></A>experience?
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>Further, the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not 
<A NAME="535"></A>possessed by the covetous or ambitious man, but only by the 
<A NAME="536"></A>philosopher?
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>What faculty?
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Reason, with whom, as we were saying, the decision ought to 
<A NAME="539"></A>rest.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>And reasoning is peculiarly his instrument?
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>If wealth and gain were the criterion, then the praise or blame of 
<A NAME="544"></A>the lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy?
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>Assuredly.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Or if honour or victory or courage, in that case the judgement of the 
<A NAME="547"></A>ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest?
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>But since experience and wisdom and reason are the 
<A NAME="550"></A>judges--
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>The only inference possible, he replied, is that pleasures which are 
<A NAME="552"></A>approved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>And so we arrive at the result, that the pleasure of the intelligent 
<A NAME="554"></A>part of the soul is the pleasantest of the three, and that he of us in 
<A NAME="555"></A>whom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest 
<A NAME="556"></A>life.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>Unquestionably, he said, the wise man speaks with authority when 
<A NAME="558"></A>he approves of his own life.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and 
<A NAME="560"></A>the pleasure which is next?
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR>Clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour; who is nearer 
<A NAME="562"></A>to himself than the money-maker.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>Last comes the lover of gain?
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Twice in succession, then, has the just man overthrown the unjust in 
<A NAME="566"></A>this conflict; and now comes the third trial, which is dedicated to Olympian 
<A NAME="567"></A>Zeus the saviour: a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure except that 
<A NAME="568"></A>of the wise is quite true and pure --all others are a shadow only; and 
<A NAME="569"></A>surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of 
<A NAME="570"></A>falls?
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR>Yes, the greatest; but will you explain yourself?
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>I will work out the subject and you shall answer my 
<A NAME="573"></A>questions.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Proceed.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Say, then, is not pleasure opposed to pain?
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>And there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor 
<A NAME="578"></A>pain?
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>There is.
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>A state which is intermediate, and a sort of repose of the soul about 
<A NAME="581"></A>either --that is what you mean?
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>You remember what people say when they are sick?
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>What do they say?
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>That after all nothing is pleasanter than health. But then they never 
<A NAME="586"></A>knew this to be the greatest of pleasures until they were 
<A NAME="587"></A>ill.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I know, he said.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>And when persons are suffering from acute pain, you must. have heard 
<A NAME="590"></A>them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their 
<A NAME="591"></A>pain?
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>I have.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>And there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest 
<A NAME="594"></A>and cessation of pain, and not any positive enjoyment, is extolled by them 
<A NAME="595"></A>as the greatest pleasure?
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; at the time they are pleased and well content to 
<A NAME="597"></A>be at rest.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>Again, when pleasure ceases, that sort of rest or cessation will 
<A NAME="599"></A>be painful?
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR>Doubtless, he said.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>Then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also 
<A NAME="602"></A>be pain?
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>So it would seem.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>But can that which is neither become both?
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>I should say not.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>And both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul, are they 
<A NAME="607"></A>not?
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>But that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion, 
<A NAME="610"></A>and in a mean between them?
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>How, then, can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is 
<A NAME="613"></A>pleasure, or that the absence of pleasure is pain?
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>This then is an appearance only and not a reality; that is tc say, 
<A NAME="616"></A>the rest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful, 
<A NAME="617"></A>and painful in comparison of what is pleasant; but all these representations, 
<A NAME="618"></A>when tried by the test of true pleasure, are not real but a sort of 
<A NAME="619"></A>imposition?
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>That is the inference.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Look at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains 
<A NAME="622"></A>and you will no longer suppose, as you perhaps may at present, that pleasure 
<A NAME="623"></A>is only the cessation of pain, or pain of pleasure.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>What are they, he said, and where shall I find 
<A NAME="625"></A>them?
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>There are many of them: take as an example the pleasures, of smell, 
<A NAME="627"></A>which are very great and have no antecedent pains; they come in a moment, 
<A NAME="628"></A>and when they depart leave no pain behind them.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>Most true, he said.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>Let us not, then, be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the cessation 
<A NAME="631"></A>of pain, or pain of pleasure.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR>No.
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Still, the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul 
<A NAME="634"></A>through the body are generally of this sort --they are reliefs of 
<A NAME="635"></A>pain.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>And the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like 
<A NAME="638"></A>nature?
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Shall I give you an illustration of them?
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Let me hear.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>You would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and lower 
<A NAME="643"></A>and middle region?
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>I should.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>And if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region, would 
<A NAME="646"></A>he not imagine that he is going up; and he who is standing in the middle 
<A NAME="647"></A>and sees whence he has come, would imagine that he is already in the upper 
<A NAME="648"></A>region, if he has never seen the true upper world?
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>To be sure, he said; how can he think otherwise?
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine, 
<A NAME="651"></A>that he was descending?
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>No doubt.
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>All that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle 
<A NAME="654"></A>and lower regions?
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Then can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth, 
<A NAME="657"></A>as they have wrong ideas about many other things, should also have wrong 
<A NAME="658"></A>ideas about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state; so that when 
<A NAME="659"></A>they are only being drawn towards the painful they feel pain and think 
<A NAME="660"></A>the pain which they experience to be real, and in like manner, when drawn 
<A NAME="661"></A>away from pain to the neutral or intermediate state, they firmly believe 
<A NAME="662"></A>that they have reached the goal of satiety and pleasure; they, not knowing 
<A NAME="663"></A>pleasure, err in contrasting pain with the absence of pain. which is like 
<A NAME="664"></A>contrasting black with grey instead of white --can you wonder, I say, at 
<A NAME="665"></A>this?
<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR>No, indeed; I should be much more disposed to wonder at the 
<A NAME="667"></A>opposite.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR>Look at the matter thus: --Hunger, thirst, and the like, are inanitions 
<A NAME="669"></A>of the bodily state?
<A NAME="670"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>And ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul?
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>And food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of 
<A NAME="674"></A>either?
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>And is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that 
<A NAME="677"></A>which has more existence the truer?
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>Clearly, from that which has more.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>What classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your 
<A NAME="680"></A>judgment --those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of 
<A NAME="681"></A>sustenance are examples, or the class which contains true opinion and knowledge 
<A NAME="682"></A>and mind and all the different kinds of virtue? Put the question in this 
<A NAME="683"></A>way: --Which has a more pure being --that which is concerned with the invariable, 
<A NAME="684"></A>the immortal, and the true, and is of such a nature, and is found in such 
<A NAME="685"></A>natures; or that which is concerned with and found in the variable and 
<A NAME="686"></A>mortal, and is itself variable and mortal?
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR>Far purer, he replied, is the being of that which is concerned 
<A NAME="688"></A>with the invariable.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR><BR>And does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in 
<A NAME="690"></A>the same degree as of essence?
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>Yes, of knowledge in the same degree.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>And of truth in the same degree?
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>And, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of 
<A NAME="695"></A>essence?
<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR>Necessarily.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Then, in general, those kinds of things which are in the service of 
<A NAME="698"></A>the body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service 
<A NAME="699"></A>of the soul?
<A NAME="700"></A><BR><BR>Far less.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>And has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the 
<A NAME="702"></A>soul?
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>What is filled with more real existence, and actually has a more real 
<A NAME="705"></A>existence, is more really filled than that which is filled with less real 
<A NAME="706"></A>existence and is less real?
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>And if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according 
<A NAME="709"></A>to nature, that which is more really filled with more real being will more 
<A NAME="710"></A>really and truly enjoy true pleasure; whereas that which participates in 
<A NAME="711"></A>less real being will be less truly and surely satisfied, and will participate 
<A NAME="712"></A>in an illusory and less real pleasure?
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR>Unquestionably.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Those then who know not wisdom and virtue, and are always busy with 
<A NAME="715"></A>gluttony and sensuality, go down and up again as far as the mean; and in 
<A NAME="716"></A>this region they move at random throughout life, but they never pass into 
<A NAME="717"></A>the true upper world; thither they neither look, nor do they ever find 
<A NAME="718"></A>their way, neither are they truly filled with true being, nor do they taste 
<A NAME="719"></A>of pure and abiding pleasure. Like cattle, with their eyes always looking 
<A NAME="720"></A>down and their heads stooping to the earth, that is, to the dining-table, 
<A NAME="721"></A>they fatten and feed and breed, and, in their excessive love of these delights, 
<A NAME="722"></A>they kick and butt at one another with horns and hoofs which are made of 
<A NAME="723"></A>iron; and they kill one another by reason of their insatiable lust. For 
<A NAME="724"></A>they fill themselves with that which is not substantial, and the part of 
<A NAME="725"></A>themselves which they fill is also unsubstantial and 
<A NAME="726"></A>incontinent.
<A NAME="727"></A><BR><BR>Verily, Socrates, said Glaucon, you describe the life of the many 
<A NAME="728"></A>like an oracle.
<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>Their pleasures are mixed with pains --how can they be otherwise? 
<A NAME="730"></A>For they are mere shadows and pictures of the true, and are coloured by 
<A NAME="731"></A>contrast, which exaggerates both light and shade, and so they implant in 
<A NAME="732"></A>the minds of fools insane desires of themselves; and they are fought about 
<A NAME="733"></A>as Stesichorus says that the Greeks fought about the shadow of Helen at 
<A NAME="734"></A>Troy in ignorance of the truth.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR><BR>Something of that sort must inevitably happen.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>And must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element 
<A NAME="737"></A>of the soul? Will not the passionate man who carries his passion into action, 
<A NAME="738"></A>be in the like case, whether he is envious and ambitious, or violent and 
<A NAME="739"></A>contentious, or angry and discontented, if he be seeking to attain honour 
<A NAME="740"></A>and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without reason or 
<A NAME="741"></A>sense?
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, the same will happen with the spirited element 
<A NAME="743"></A>also.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>Then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour, 
<A NAME="745"></A>when they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company of 
<A NAME="746"></A>reason and knowledge, and pursue after and win the pleasures which wisdom 
<A NAME="747"></A>shows them, will also have the truest pleasures in the highest degree which 
<A NAME="748"></A>is attainable to them, inasmuch as they follow truth; and they will have 
<A NAME="749"></A>the pleasures which are natural to them, if that which is best for each 
<A NAME="750"></A>one is also most natural to him?
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR>Yes, certainly; the best is the most natural.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>And when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle, and there 
<A NAME="753"></A>is no division, the several parts are just, and do each of them their own 
<A NAME="754"></A>business, and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of which they 
<A NAME="755"></A>are capable?
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>But when either of the two other principles prevails, it fails in attaining 
<A NAME="758"></A>its own pleasure, and compels the rest to pursue after a pleasure which 
<A NAME="759"></A>is a shadow only and which is not their own?
<A NAME="760"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>And the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and 
<A NAME="762"></A>reason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>And is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance 
<A NAME="765"></A>from law and order?
<A NAME="766"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>And the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the greatest 
<A NAME="768"></A>distance? Yes.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR><BR>And the royal and orderly desires are nearest?
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>Then the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural 
<A NAME="772"></A>pleasure, and the king at the least?
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>But if so, the tyrant will live most unpleasantly, and the king most 
<A NAME="775"></A>pleasantly?
<A NAME="776"></A><BR><BR>Inevitably.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Would you know the measure of the interval which separates 
<A NAME="778"></A>them?
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>Will you tell me?
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>There appear to be three pleasures, one genuine and two spurious: now 
<A NAME="781"></A>the transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious; he 
<A NAME="782"></A>has run away from the region of law and reason, and taken up his abode 
<A NAME="783"></A>with certain slave pleasures which are his satellites, and the measure 
<A NAME="784"></A>of his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR>How do you mean?
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>I assume, I said, that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch; 
<A NAME="787"></A>the democrat was in the middle?
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>And if there is truth in what has preceded, he will be wedded to an 
<A NAME="790"></A>image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure 
<A NAME="791"></A>of the oligarch?
<A NAME="792"></A><BR><BR>He will.
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>And the oligarch is third from the royal; since we count as one royal 
<A NAME="794"></A>and aristocratical?
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he is third.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>Then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number 
<A NAME="797"></A>which is three times three?
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR>Manifestly.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>The shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of 
<A NAME="800"></A>length will be a plane figure.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>And if you raise the power and make the plane a solid, there is no 
<A NAME="803"></A>difficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is parted 
<A NAME="804"></A>from the king.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>Yes; the arithmetician will easily do the sum.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>Or if some person begins at the other end and measures the interval 
<A NAME="807"></A>by which the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure, he will 
<A NAME="808"></A>find him, when the multiplication is complete, living 729 times more pleasantly, 
<A NAME="809"></A>and the tyrant more painfully by this same interval.
<A NAME="810"></A><BR><BR>What a wonderful calculation! And how enormous is the distance 
<A NAME="811"></A>which separates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and 
<A NAME="812"></A>pain!
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR>Yet a true calculation, I said, and a number which nearly concerns 
<A NAME="814"></A>human life, if human beings are concerned with days and nights and months 
<A NAME="815"></A>and years.
<A NAME="816"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, human life is certainly concerned with 
<A NAME="817"></A>them.
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>Then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil 
<A NAME="819"></A>and unjust, his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of 
<A NAME="820"></A>life and in beauty and virtue?
<A NAME="821"></A><BR><BR>Immeasurably greater.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>Well, I said, and now having arrived at this stage of the argument, 
<A NAME="823"></A>we may revert to the words which brought us hither: Was not some one saying 
<A NAME="824"></A>that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed to be 
<A NAME="825"></A>just?
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that was said.
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>Now then, having determined the power and quality of justice and injustice, 
<A NAME="828"></A>let us have a little conversation with him.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><BR>What shall we say to him?
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>Let us make an image of the soul, that he may have his own words presented 
<A NAME="831"></A>before his eyes.
<A NAME="832"></A><BR><BR>Of what sort?
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>An ideal image of the soul, like the composite creations of ancient 
<A NAME="834"></A>mythology, such as the Chimera or Scylla or Cerberus, and there are many 
<A NAME="835"></A>others in which two or more different natures are said to grow into 
<A NAME="836"></A>one.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR><BR>There are said of have been such unions.
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>Then do you now model the form of a multitudinous, many-headed monster, 
<A NAME="839"></A>having a ring of heads of all manner of beasts, tame and wild, which he 
<A NAME="840"></A>is able to generate and metamorphose at will.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR><BR>You suppose marvellous powers in the artist; but, as language is 
<A NAME="842"></A>more pliable than wax or any similar substance, let there be such a model 
<A NAME="843"></A>as you propose.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR><BR>Suppose now that you make a second form as of a lion, and a third 
<A NAME="845"></A>of a man, the second smaller than the first, and the third smaller than 
<A NAME="846"></A>the second.
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><BR>That, he said, is an easier task; and I have made them as you 
<A NAME="848"></A>say.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>And now join them, and let the three grow into one.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>That has been accomplished.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>Next fashion the outside of them into a single image, as of a man, 
<A NAME="852"></A>so that he who is not able to look within, and sees only the outer hull, 
<A NAME="853"></A>may believe the beast to be a single human creature. I have done so, he 
<A NAME="854"></A>said.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR>And now, to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human 
<A NAME="856"></A>creature to be unjust, and unprofitable to be just, let us reply that, 
<A NAME="857"></A>if he be right, it is profitable for this creature to feast the multitudinous 
<A NAME="858"></A>monster and strengthen the lion and the lion-like qualities, but to starve 
<A NAME="859"></A>and weaken the man, who is consequently liable to be dragged about at the 
<A NAME="860"></A>mercy of either of the other two; and he is not to attempt to familiarize 
<A NAME="861"></A>or harmonize them with one another --he ought rather to suffer them to 
<A NAME="862"></A>fight and bite and devour one another.
<A NAME="863"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said; that is what the approver of injustice 
<A NAME="864"></A>says.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>To him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so 
<A NAME="866"></A>speak and act as to give the man within him in some way or other the most 
<A NAME="867"></A>complete mastery over the entire human creature.
<A NAME="868"></A><BR><BR>He should watch over the many-headed monster like a good husbandman, 
<A NAME="869"></A>fostering and cultivating the gentle qualities, and preventing the wild 
<A NAME="870"></A>ones from growing; he should be making the lion-heart his ally, and in 
<A NAME="871"></A>common care of them all should be uniting the several parts with one another 
<A NAME="872"></A>and with himself.
<A NAME="873"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that is quite what the maintainer of justice 
<A NAME="874"></A>say.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>And so from every point of view, whether of pleasure, honour, or advantage, 
<A NAME="876"></A>the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth, and the disapprover 
<A NAME="877"></A>is wrong and false and ignorant.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR>Yes, from every point of view.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>Come, now, and let us gently reason with the unjust, who is not intentionally 
<A NAME="880"></A>in error. 'Sweet Sir,' we will say to him, what think you of things esteemed 
<A NAME="881"></A>noble and ignoble? Is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the 
<A NAME="882"></A>man, or rather to the god in man; and the ignoble that which subjects the 
<A NAME="883"></A>man to the beast?' He can hardly avoid saying yes --can he 
<A NAME="884"></A>now?
<A NAME="885"></A><BR><BR>Not if he has any regard for my opinion.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>But, if he agree so far, we may ask him to answer another question: 
<A NAME="887"></A>'Then how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the condition 
<A NAME="888"></A>that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst? Who can imagine 
<A NAME="889"></A>that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery for money, especially 
<A NAME="890"></A>if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men, would be the gainer, 
<A NAME="891"></A>however large might be the sum which he received? And will any one say 
<A NAME="892"></A>that he is not a miserable caitiff who remorselessly sells his own divine 
<A NAME="893"></A>being to that which is most godless and detestable? Eriphyle took the necklace 
<A NAME="894"></A>as the price of her husband's life, but he is taking a bribe in order to 
<A NAME="895"></A>compass a worse ruin.'
<A NAME="896"></A><BR><BR>Yes, said Glaucon, far worse --I will answer for 
<A NAME="897"></A>him.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>Has not the intemperate been censured of old, because in him the huge 
<A NAME="899"></A>multiform monster is allowed to be too much at large?
<A NAME="900"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>And men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent 
<A NAME="902"></A>element in them disproportionately grows and gains strength?
<A NAME="903"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>And luxury and softness are blamed, because they relax and weaken this 
<A NAME="905"></A>same creature, and make a coward of him?
<A NAME="906"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>And is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates 
<A NAME="908"></A>the spirited animal to the unruly monster, and, for the sake of money, 
<A NAME="909"></A>of which he can never have enough, habituates him in the days of his youth 
<A NAME="910"></A>to be trampled in the mire, and from being a lion to become a 
<A NAME="911"></A>monkey?
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>And why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach Only because 
<A NAME="914"></A>they imply a natural weakness of the higher principle; the individual is 
<A NAME="915"></A>unable to control the creatures within him, but has to court them, and 
<A NAME="916"></A>his great study is how to flatter them.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR>Such appears to be the reason.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>And therefore, being desirous of placing him under a rule like that 
<A NAME="919"></A>of the best, we say that he ought to be the servant of the best, in whom 
<A NAME="920"></A>the Divine rules; not, as Thrasymachus supposed, to the injury of the servant, 
<A NAME="921"></A>but because every one had better be ruled by divine wisdom dwelling within 
<A NAME="922"></A>him; or, if this be impossible, then by an external authority, in order 
<A NAME="923"></A>that we may be all, as far as possible, under the same government, friends 
<A NAME="924"></A>and equals.
<A NAME="925"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>And this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law, which is the 
<A NAME="927"></A>ally of the whole city; and is seen also in the authority which we exercise 
<A NAME="928"></A>over children, and the refusal to let them be free until we have established 
<A NAME="929"></A>in them a principle analogous to the constitution of a state, and by cultivation 
<A NAME="930"></A>of this higher element have set up in their hearts a guardian and ruler 
<A NAME="931"></A>like our own, and when this is done they may go their 
<A NAME="932"></A>ways.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, the purpose of the law is manifest.
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>From what point of view, then, and on what ground can we say that a 
<A NAME="935"></A>man is profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness, which will 
<A NAME="936"></A>make him a worse man, even though he acquire money or power by his 
<A NAME="937"></A>wickedness?
<A NAME="938"></A><BR><BR>From no point of view at all.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>What shall he profit, if his injustice be undetected and unpunished? 
<A NAME="940"></A>He who is undetected only gets worse, whereas he who is detected and punished 
<A NAME="941"></A>has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized; the gentler element 
<A NAME="942"></A>in him is liberated, and his whole soul is perfected and ennobled by the 
<A NAME="943"></A>acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom, more than the body ever 
<A NAME="944"></A>is by receiving gifts of beauty, strength and health, in proportion as 
<A NAME="945"></A>the soul is more honourable than the body.
<A NAME="946"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said.
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>To this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the energies 
<A NAME="948"></A>of his life. And in the first place, he will honour studies which impress 
<A NAME="949"></A>these qualities on his soul and disregard others?
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><BR>Clearly, he said.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>In the next place, he will regulate his bodily habit and training, 
<A NAME="952"></A>and so far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures, 
<A NAME="953"></A>that he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter; his first 
<A NAME="954"></A>object will be not that he may be fair or strong or well, unless he is 
<A NAME="955"></A>likely thereby to gain temperance, but he will always desire so to attemper 
<A NAME="956"></A>the body as to preserve the harmony of the soul?
<A NAME="957"></A><BR><BR>Certainly he will, if he has true music in him.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>And in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and 
<A NAME="959"></A>harmony which he will also observe; he will not allow himself to be dazzled 
<A NAME="960"></A>by the foolish applause of the world, and heap up riches to his own infinite 
<A NAME="961"></A>harm?
<A NAME="962"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not, he said.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>He will look at the city which is within him, and take heed that no 
<A NAME="964"></A>disorder occur in it, such as might arise either from superfluity or from 
<A NAME="965"></A>want; and upon this principle he will regulate his property and gain or 
<A NAME="966"></A>spend according to his means.
<A NAME="967"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>And, for the same reason, he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours 
<A NAME="969"></A>as he deems likely to make him a better man; but those, whether private 
<A NAME="970"></A>or public, which are likely to disorder his life, he will 
<A NAME="971"></A>avoid?
<A NAME="972"></A><BR><BR>Then, if that is his motive, he will not be a 
<A NAME="973"></A>statesman.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>By the dog of Egypt, he will! in the city which 's his own he certainly 
<A NAME="975"></A>will, though in the land of his birth perhaps not, unless he have a divine 
<A NAME="976"></A>call.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR><BR>I understand; you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which 
<A NAME="978"></A>we are the founders, and which exists in idea only; for I do not believe 
<A NAME="979"></A>that there is such an one anywhere on earth?
<A NAME="980"></A><BR><BR>In heaven, I replied, there is laid up a pattern of it, methinks, 
<A NAME="981"></A>which he who desires may behold, and beholding, may set his own house in 
<A NAME="982"></A>order. But whether such an one exists, or ever will exist in fact, is no 
<A NAME="983"></A>matter; for he will live after the manner of that city, having nothing 
<A NAME="984"></A>to do with any other.
<A NAME="985"></A><BR><BR>I think so, he said.
