<A NAME="13"></A><BR><BR><B>Socrates.</B> Welcome, Ion. Are you from your native city of 
<A NAME="14"></A>Ephesus?
<A NAME="15"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> No, Socrates; but from Epidaurus, where I attended 
<A NAME="16"></A>the festival of Asclepius.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And do the Epidaurians have contests of rhapsodes at 
<A NAME="18"></A>the festival?
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> O yes; and of all sorts of musical 
<A NAME="20"></A>performers.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And were you one of the competitors- and did you 
<A NAME="22"></A>succeed?
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> I obtained the first prize of all, 
<A NAME="24"></A>Socrates.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well done; and I hope that you will do the same for 
<A NAME="26"></A>us at the Panathenaea.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> And I will, please heaven.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I often envy the profession of a rhapsode, Ion; for 
<A NAME="29"></A>you have always to wear fine clothes, and to look as beautiful as you can 
<A NAME="30"></A>is a part of your art. Then, again, you are obliged to be continually in 
<A NAME="31"></A>the company of many good poets; and especially of Homer, who is the best 
<A NAME="32"></A>and most divine of them; and to understand him, and not merely learn his 
<A NAME="33"></A>words by rote, is a thing greatly to be envied. And no man can be a rhapsode 
<A NAME="34"></A>who does not understand the meaning of the poet. For the rhapsode ought 
<A NAME="35"></A>to interpret the mind of the poet to his hearers, but how can he interpret 
<A NAME="36"></A>him well unless he knows what he means? All this is greatly to be 
<A NAME="37"></A>envied.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Very true, Socrates; interpretation has certainly been 
<A NAME="39"></A>the most laborious part of my art; and I believe myself able to speak about 
<A NAME="40"></A>Homer better than any man; and that neither Metrodorus of Lampsacus, nor 
<A NAME="41"></A>Stesimbrotus of Thasos, nor Glaucon, nor any one else who ever was, had 
<A NAME="42"></A>as good ideas about Homer as I have, or as many.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I am glad to hear you say so, Ion; I see that you will 
<A NAME="44"></A>not refuse to acquaint me with them.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Certainly, Socrates; and you really ought to hear how 
<A NAME="46"></A>exquisitely I render Homer. I think that the Homeridae should give me a 
<A NAME="47"></A>golden crown.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I shall take an opportunity of hearing your embellishments 
<A NAME="49"></A>of him at some other time. But just now I should like to ask you a question: 
<A NAME="50"></A>Does your art extend to Hesiod and Archilochus, or to Homer 
<A NAME="51"></A>only?
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> To Homer only; he is in himself quite 
<A NAME="53"></A>enough.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Are there any things about which Homer and Hesiod 
<A NAME="55"></A>agree?
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes; in my opinion there are a good 
<A NAME="57"></A>many.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And can you interpret better what Homer says, or what 
<A NAME="59"></A>Hesiod says, about these matters in which they agree?
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> I can interpret them equally well, Socrates, where 
<A NAME="61"></A>they agree.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But what about matters in which they do not agree?- 
<A NAME="63"></A>for example, about divination, of which both Homer and Hesiod have something 
<A NAME="64"></A>to say-
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Very true:
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Would you or a good prophet be a better interpreter 
<A NAME="67"></A>of what these two poets say about divination, not only when they agree, 
<A NAME="68"></A>but when they disagree?
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> A prophet.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if you were a prophet, would you be able to interpret 
<A NAME="71"></A>them when they disagree as well as when they agree?
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Clearly.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But how did you come to have this skill about Homer 
<A NAME="74"></A>only, and not about Hesiod or the other poets? Does not Homer speak of 
<A NAME="75"></A>the same themes which all other poets handle? Is not war his great argument? 
<A NAME="76"></A>and does he not speak of human society and of intercourse of men, good 
<A NAME="77"></A>and bad, skilled and unskilled, and of the gods conversing with one another 
<A NAME="78"></A>and with mankind, and about what happens in heaven and in the world below, 
<A NAME="79"></A>and the generations of gods and heroes? Are not these the themes of which 
<A NAME="80"></A>Homer sings?
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Very true, Socrates.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And do not the other poets sing of the 
<A NAME="83"></A>same?
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes, Socrates; but not in the same way as 
<A NAME="85"></A>Homer.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What, in a worse way?
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes, in a far worse.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And Homer in a better way?
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> He is incomparably better.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And yet surely, my dear friend Ion, in a discussion 
<A NAME="91"></A>about arithmetic, where many people are speaking, and one speaks better 
<A NAME="92"></A>than the rest, there is somebody who can judge which of them is the good 
<A NAME="93"></A>speaker?
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And he who judges of the good will be the same as he 
<A NAME="96"></A>who judges of the bad speakers?
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> The same.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And he will be the arithmetician?
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, and in discussions about the wholesomeness of 
<A NAME="101"></A>food, when many persons are speaking, and one speaks better than the rest, 
<A NAME="102"></A>will he who recognizes the better speaker be a different person from him 
<A NAME="103"></A>who recognizes the worse, or the same?
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Clearly the same.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And who is he, and what is his name?
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> The physician.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And speaking generally, in all discussions in which 
<A NAME="108"></A>the subject is the same and many men are speaking, will not he who knows 
<A NAME="109"></A>the good know the bad speaker also? For if he does not know the bad, neither 
<A NAME="110"></A>will he know the good when the same topic is being discussed.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> True.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Is not the same person skilful in 
<A NAME="113"></A>both?
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And you say that Homer and the other poets, such as 
<A NAME="116"></A>Hesiod and Archilochus, speak of the same things, although not in the same 
<A NAME="117"></A>way; but the one speaks well and the other not so well?
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes; and I am right in saying so.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if you knew the good speaker, you would also know 
<A NAME="120"></A>the inferior speakers to be inferior?
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> That is true.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, my dear friend, can I be mistaken in saying that 
<A NAME="123"></A>Ion is equally skilled in Homer and in other poets, since he himself acknowledges 
<A NAME="124"></A>that the same person will be a good judge of all those who speak of the 
<A NAME="125"></A>same things; and that almost all poets do speak of the same 
<A NAME="126"></A>things?
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Why then, Socrates, do I lose attention and go to sleep 
<A NAME="128"></A>and have absolutely no ideas of the least value, when any one speaks of 
<A NAME="129"></A>any other poet; but when Homer is mentioned, I wake up at once and am all 
<A NAME="130"></A>attention and have plenty to say?
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The reason, my friend, is obvious. No one can fail 
<A NAME="132"></A>to see that you speak of Homer without any art or knowledge. If you were 
<A NAME="133"></A>able to speak of him by rules of art, you would have been able to speak 
<A NAME="134"></A>of all other poets; for poetry is a whole.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And when any one acquires any other art as a whole, 
<A NAME="137"></A>the same may be said of them. Would you like me to explain my meaning, 
<A NAME="138"></A>Ion?
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes, indeed, Socrates; I very much wish that you would: 
<A NAME="140"></A>for I love to hear you wise men talk.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> O that we were wise, Ion, and that you could truly 
<A NAME="142"></A>call us so; but you rhapsodes and actors, and the poets whose verses you 
<A NAME="143"></A>sing, are wise; whereas I am a common man, who only speak the truth. For 
<A NAME="144"></A>consider what a very commonplace and trivial thing is this which I have 
<A NAME="145"></A>said- a thing which any man might say: that when a man has acquired a knowledge 
<A NAME="146"></A>of a whole art, the enquiry into good and bad is one and the same. Let 
<A NAME="147"></A>us consider this matter; is not the art of painting a 
<A NAME="148"></A>whole?
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And there are and have been many painters good and 
<A NAME="151"></A>bad?
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And did you ever know any one who was skilful in pointing 
<A NAME="154"></A>out the excellences and defects of Polygnotus the son of Aglaophon, but 
<A NAME="155"></A>incapable of criticizing other painters; and when the work of any other 
<A NAME="156"></A>painter was produced, went to sleep and was at a loss, and had no ideas; 
<A NAME="157"></A>but when he had to give his opinion about Polygnotus, or whoever the painter 
<A NAME="158"></A>might be, and about him only, woke up and was attentive and had plenty 
<A NAME="159"></A>to say?
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> No indeed, I have never known such a 
<A NAME="161"></A>person.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Or did you ever know of any one in sculpture, who was 
<A NAME="163"></A>skilful in expounding the merits of Daedalus the son of Metion, or of Epeius 
<A NAME="164"></A>the son of Panopeus, or of Theodorus the Samian, or of any individual sculptor; 
<A NAME="165"></A>but when the works of sculptors in general were produced, was at a loss 
<A NAME="166"></A>and went to sleep and had nothing to say?
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> No indeed; no more than the other.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if I am not mistaken, you never met with any one 
<A NAME="169"></A>among flute-players or harp- players or singers to the harp or rhapsodes 
<A NAME="170"></A>who was able to discourse of Olympus or Thamyras or Orpheus, or Phemius 
<A NAME="171"></A>the rhapsode of Ithaca, but was at a loss when he came to speak of Ion 
<A NAME="172"></A>of Ephesus, and had no notion of his merits or defects?
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> I cannot deny what you say, Socrates. Nevertheless 
<A NAME="174"></A>I am conscious in my own self, and the world agrees with me in thinking 
<A NAME="175"></A>that I do speak better and have more to say about Homer than any other 
<A NAME="176"></A>man. But I do not speak equally well about others- tell me the reason of 
<A NAME="177"></A>this.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I perceive, Ion; and I will proceed to explain to you 
<A NAME="179"></A>what I imagine to be the reason of this. The gift which you possess of 
<A NAME="180"></A>speaking excellently about Homer is not an art, but, as I was just saying, 
<A NAME="181"></A>an inspiration; there is a divinity moving you, like that contained in 
<A NAME="182"></A>the stone which Euripides calls a magnet, but which is commonly known as 
<A NAME="183"></A>the stone of Heraclea. This stone not only attracts iron rings, but also 
<A NAME="184"></A>imparts to them a similar power of attracting other rings; and sometimes 
<A NAME="185"></A>you may see a number of pieces of iron and rings suspended from one another 
<A NAME="186"></A>so as to form quite a long chain: and all of them derive their power of 
<A NAME="187"></A>suspension from the original stone. In like manner the Muse first of all 
<A NAME="188"></A>inspires men herself; and from these inspired persons a chain of other 
<A NAME="189"></A>persons is suspended, who take the inspiration. For all good poets, epic 
<A NAME="190"></A>as well as lyric, compose their beautiful poems not by art, but because 
<A NAME="191"></A>they are inspired and possessed. And as the Corybantian revellers when 
<A NAME="192"></A>they dance are not in their right mind, so the lyric poets are not in their 
<A NAME="193"></A>right mind when they are composing their beautiful strains: but when falling 
<A NAME="194"></A>under the power of music and metre they are inspired and possessed; like 
<A NAME="195"></A>Bacchic maidens who draw milk and honey from the rivers when they are under 
<A NAME="196"></A>the influence of Dionysus but not when they are in their right mind. And 
<A NAME="197"></A>the soul of the lyric poet does the same, as they themselves say; for they 
<A NAME="198"></A>tell us that they bring songs from honeyed fountains, culling them out 
<A NAME="199"></A>of the gardens and dells of the Muses; they, like the bees, winging their 
<A NAME="200"></A>way from flower to flower. And this is true. For the poet is a light and 
<A NAME="201"></A>winged and holy thing, and there is no invention in him until he has been 
<A NAME="202"></A>inspired and is out of his senses, and the mind is no longer in him: when 
<A NAME="203"></A>he has not attained to this state, he is powerless and is unable to utter 
<A NAME="204"></A>his oracles.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>Many are the noble words in which poets speak concerning the actions 
<A NAME="206"></A>of men; but like yourself when speaking about Homer, they do not speak 
<A NAME="207"></A>of them by any rules of art: they are simply inspired to utter that to 
<A NAME="208"></A>which the Muse impels them, and that only; and when inspired, one of them 
<A NAME="209"></A>will make dithyrambs, another hymns of praise, another choral strains, 
<A NAME="210"></A>another epic or iambic verses- and he who is good at one is not good any 
<A NAME="211"></A>other kind of verse: for not by art does the poet sing, but by power divine. 
<A NAME="212"></A>Had he learned by rules of art, he would have known how to speak not of 
<A NAME="213"></A>one theme only, but of all; and therefore God takes away the minds of poets, 
<A NAME="214"></A>and uses them as his ministers, as he also uses diviners and holy prophets, 
<A NAME="215"></A>in order that we who hear them may know them to be speaking not of themselves 
<A NAME="216"></A>who utter these priceless words in a state of unconsciousness, but that 
<A NAME="217"></A>God himself is the speaker, and that through them he is conversing with 
<A NAME="218"></A>us. And Tynnichus the Chalcidian affords a striking instance of what I 
<A NAME="219"></A>am saying: he wrote nothing that any one would care to remember but the 
<A NAME="220"></A>famous paean which; in every one's mouth, one of the finest poems ever 
<A NAME="221"></A>written, simply an invention of the Muses, as he himself says. For in this 
<A NAME="222"></A>way, the God would seem to indicate to us and not allow us to doubt that 
<A NAME="223"></A>these beautiful poems are not human, or the work of man, but divine and 
<A NAME="224"></A>the work of God; and that the poets are only the interpreters of the Gods 
<A NAME="225"></A>by whom they are severally possessed. Was not this the lesson which the 
<A NAME="226"></A>God intended to teach when by the mouth of the worst of poets he sang the 
<A NAME="227"></A>best of songs? Am I not right, Ion?
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes, indeed, Socrates, I feel that you are; for your 
<A NAME="229"></A>words touch my soul, and I am persuaded that good poets by a divine inspiration 
<A NAME="230"></A>interpret the things of the Gods to us.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And you rhapsodists are the interpreters of the 
<A NAME="232"></A>poets?
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> There again you are right.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then you are the interpreters of 
<A NAME="235"></A>interpreters?
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Precisely.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I wish you would frankly tell me, Ion, what I am going 
<A NAME="238"></A>to ask of you: When you produce the greatest effect upon the audience in 
<A NAME="239"></A>the recitation of some striking passage, such as the apparition of Odysseus 
<A NAME="240"></A>leaping forth on the floor, recognized by the suitors and casting his arrows 
<A NAME="241"></A>at his feet, or the description of Achilles rushing at Hector, or the sorrows 
<A NAME="242"></A>of Andromache, Hecuba, or Priam,- are you in your right mind? Are you not 
<A NAME="243"></A>carried out of yourself, and does not your soul in an ecstasy seem to be 
<A NAME="244"></A>among the persons or places of which you are speaking, whether they are 
<A NAME="245"></A>in Ithaca or in Troy or whatever may be the scene of the 
<A NAME="246"></A>poem?
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> That proof strikes home to me, Socrates. For I must 
<A NAME="248"></A>frankly confess that at the tale of pity, my eyes are filled with tears, 
<A NAME="249"></A>and when I speak of horrors, my hair stands on end and my heart 
<A NAME="250"></A>throbs.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, Ion, and what are we to say of a man who at a 
<A NAME="252"></A>sacrifice or festival, when he is dressed in holiday attire and has golden 
<A NAME="253"></A>crowns upon his head, of which nobody has robbed him, appears sweeping 
<A NAME="254"></A>or panic-stricken in the presence of more than twenty thousand friendly 
<A NAME="255"></A>faces, when there is no one despoiling or wronging him;- is he in his right 
<A NAME="256"></A>mind or is he not?
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> No indeed, Socrates, I must say that, strictly speaking, 
<A NAME="258"></A>he is not in his right mind.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And are you aware that you produce similar effects 
<A NAME="260"></A>on most spectators?
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Only too well; for I look down upon them from the stage, 
<A NAME="262"></A>and behold the various emotions of pity, wonder, sternness, stamped upon 
<A NAME="263"></A>their countenances when I am speaking: and I am obliged to give my very 
<A NAME="264"></A>best attention to them; for if I make them cry I myself shall laugh, and 
<A NAME="265"></A>if I make them laugh I myself shall cry when the time of payment 
<A NAME="266"></A>arrives.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do you know that the spectator is the last of the rings 
<A NAME="268"></A>which, as I am saying, receive the power of the original magnet from one 
<A NAME="269"></A>another? The rhapsode like yourself and the actor are intermediate links, 
<A NAME="270"></A>and the poet himself is the first of them. Through all these the God sways 
<A NAME="271"></A>the souls of men in any direction which he pleases, and makes one man hang 
<A NAME="272"></A>down from another. Thus there is a vast chain of dancers and masters and 
<A NAME="273"></A>undermasters of choruses, who are suspended, as if from the stone, at the 
<A NAME="274"></A>side of the rings which hang down from the Muse. And every poet has some 
<A NAME="275"></A>Muse from whom he is suspended, and by whom he is said to be possessed, 
<A NAME="276"></A>which is nearly the same thing; for he is taken hold of. And from these 
<A NAME="277"></A>first rings, which are the poets, depend others, some deriving their inspiration 
<A NAME="278"></A>from Orpheus, others from Musaeus; but the greater number are possessed 
<A NAME="279"></A>and held by Homer. Of whom, Ion, you are one, and are possessed by Homer; 
<A NAME="280"></A>and when any one repeats the words of another poet you go to sleep, and 
<A NAME="281"></A>know not what to say; but when any one recites a strain of Homer you wake 
<A NAME="282"></A>up in a moment, and your soul leaps within you, and you have plenty to 
<A NAME="283"></A>say; for not by art or knowledge about Homer do you say what you say, but 
<A NAME="284"></A>by divine inspiration and by possession; just as the Corybantian revellers 
<A NAME="285"></A>too have a quick perception of that strain only which is appropriated to 
<A NAME="286"></A>the God by whom they are possessed, and have plenty of dances and words 
<A NAME="287"></A>for that, but take no heed of any other. And you, Ion, when the name of 
<A NAME="288"></A>Homer is mentioned have plenty to say, and have nothing to say of others. 
<A NAME="289"></A>You ask, "Why is this?" The answer is that you praise Homer not by art 
<A NAME="290"></A>but by divine inspiration.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> That is good, Socrates; and yet I doubt whether you 
<A NAME="292"></A>will ever have eloquence enough to persuade me that I praise Homer only 
<A NAME="293"></A>when I am mad and possessed; and if you could hear me speak of him I am 
<A NAME="294"></A>sure you would never think this to be the case.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I should like very much to hear you, but not until 
<A NAME="296"></A>you have answered a question which I have to ask. On what part of Homer 
<A NAME="297"></A>do you speak well?- not surely about every part.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> There is no part, Socrates, about which I do not speak 
<A NAME="299"></A>well of that I can assure you.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Surely not about things in Homer of which you have 
<A NAME="301"></A>no knowledge?
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> And what is there in Homer of which I have no 
<A NAME="303"></A>knowledge?
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why, does not Homer speak in many passages about arts? 
<A NAME="305"></A>For example, about driving; if I can only remember the lines I will repeat 
<A NAME="306"></A>them.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> I remember, and will repeat them.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Tell me then, what Nestor says to Antilochus, his son, 
<A NAME="309"></A>where he bids him be careful of the turn at the horse-race in honour of 
<A NAME="310"></A>Patroclus.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> He says:
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>Bend gently in the polished chariot to the left of them, and urge 
<A NAME="313"></A>the horse on the right hand with whip and voice; and slacken the rein. 
<A NAME="314"></A>And when you are at the goal, let the left horse draw near, yet so that 
<A NAME="315"></A>the nave of the well-wrought wheel may not even seem to touch the extremity; 
<A NAME="316"></A>and avoid catching the stone.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Enough. Now, Ion, will the charioteer or the physician 
<A NAME="318"></A>be the better judge of the propriety of these lines?
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> The charioteer, clearly.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And will the reason be that this is his art, or will 
<A NAME="321"></A>there be any other reason?
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> No, that will be the reason.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And every art is appointed by God to have knowledge 
<A NAME="324"></A>of a certain work; for that which we know by the art of the pilot we do 
<A NAME="325"></A>not know by the art of medicine?
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Nor do we know by the art of the carpenter that which 
<A NAME="328"></A>we know by the art of medicine?
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And this is true of all the arts;- that which we know 
<A NAME="331"></A>with one art we do not know with the other? But let me ask a prior question: 
<A NAME="332"></A>You admit that there are differences of arts?
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You would argue, as I should, that when one art is 
<A NAME="335"></A>of one kind of knowledge and another of another, they are 
<A NAME="336"></A>different?
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, surely; for if the subject of knowledge were the 
<A NAME="339"></A>same, there would be no meaning in saying that the arts were different,- 
<A NAME="340"></A>if they both gave the same knowledge. For example, I know that here are 
<A NAME="341"></A>five fingers, and you know the same. And if I were to ask whether I and 
<A NAME="342"></A>you became acquainted with this fact by the help of the same art of arithmetic, 
<A NAME="343"></A>you would acknowledge that we did?
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Tell me, then, what I was intending to ask you- whether 
<A NAME="346"></A>this holds universally? Must the same art have the same subject of knowledge, 
<A NAME="347"></A>and different arts other subjects of knowledge?
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> That is my opinion, Socrates.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then he who has no knowledge of a particular art will 
<A NAME="350"></A>have no right judgment of the sayings and doings of that 
<A NAME="351"></A>art?
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then which will be a better judge of the lines which 
<A NAME="354"></A>you were reciting from Homer, you or the charioteer?
<A NAME="355"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> The charioteer.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why, yes, because you are a rhapsode and not a 
<A NAME="357"></A>charioteer.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the art of the rhapsode is different from that 
<A NAME="360"></A>of the charioteer?
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if a different knowledge, then a knowledge of different 
<A NAME="363"></A>matters?
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> True.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You know the passage in which Hecamede, the concubine 
<A NAME="366"></A>of Nestor, is described as giving to the wounded Machaon a posset, as he 
<A NAME="367"></A>says,
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>Made with Pramnian wine; and she grated cheese of goat's milk with 
<A NAME="369"></A>a grater of bronze, and at his side placed an onion which gives a relish 
<A NAME="370"></A>to drink. Now would you say that the art of the rhapsode or the art of 
<A NAME="371"></A>medicine was better able to judge of the propriety of these 
<A NAME="372"></A>lines?
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> The art of medicine.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And when Homer says,
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>And she descended into the deep like a leaden plummet, which, set 
<A NAME="376"></A>in the horn of ox that ranges in the fields, rushes along carrying death 
<A NAME="377"></A>among the ravenous fishes,- will the art of the fisherman or of the rhapsode 
<A NAME="378"></A>be better able to judge whether these lines are rightly expressed or 
<A NAME="379"></A>not?
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Clearly, Socrates, the art of the 
<A NAME="381"></A>fisherman.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Come now, suppose that you were to say to me: "Since 
<A NAME="383"></A>you, Socrates, are able to assign different passages in Homer to their 
<A NAME="384"></A>corresponding arts, I wish that you would tell me what are the passages 
<A NAME="385"></A>of which the excellence ought to be judged by the prophet and prophetic 
<A NAME="386"></A>art"; and you will see how readily and truly I shall answer you. For there 
<A NAME="387"></A>are many such passages, particularly in the Odyssey; as, for example, the 
<A NAME="388"></A>passage in which Theoclymenus the prophet of the house of Melampus says 
<A NAME="389"></A>to the suitors:-
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR>Wretched men! what is happening to you? Your heads and your faces 
<A NAME="391"></A>and your limbs underneath are shrouded in night; and the voice of lamentation 
<A NAME="392"></A>bursts forth, and your cheeks are wet with tears. And the vestibule is 
<A NAME="393"></A>full, and the court is full, of ghosts descending into the darkness of 
<A NAME="394"></A>Erebus, and the sun has perished out of heaven, and an evil mist is spread 
<A NAME="395"></A>abroad.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>And there are many such passages in the Iliad also; as for example 
<A NAME="397"></A>in the description of the battle near the rampart, where he 
<A NAME="398"></A>says:-
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>As they were eager to pass the ditch, there came to them an omen: 
<A NAME="400"></A>a soaring eagle, holding back the people on the left, bore a huge bloody 
<A NAME="401"></A>dragon in his talons, still living and panting; nor had he yet resigned 
<A NAME="402"></A>the strife, for he bent back and smote the bird which carried him on the 
<A NAME="403"></A>breast by the neck, and he in pain let him fall from him to the ground 
<A NAME="404"></A>into the midst of the multitude. And the eagle, with a cry, was borne afar 
<A NAME="405"></A>on the wings of the wind.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR>These are the sort of things which I should say that the prophet 
<A NAME="407"></A>ought to consider and determine.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> And you are quite right, Socrates, in saying 
<A NAME="409"></A>so.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, Ion, and you are right also. And as I have selected 
<A NAME="411"></A>from the Iliad and Odyssey for you passages which describe the office of 
<A NAME="412"></A>the prophet and the physician and the fisherman, do you, who know Homer 
<A NAME="413"></A>so much better than I do, Ion, select for me passages which relate to the 
<A NAME="414"></A>rhapsode and the rhapsode's art, and which the rhapsode ought to examine 
<A NAME="415"></A>and judge of better than other men.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> All passages, I should say, Socrates.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Not all, Ion, surely. Have you already forgotten what 
<A NAME="418"></A>you were saying? A rhapsode ought to have a better memory.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Why, what am I forgetting?
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do you not remember that you declared the art of the 
<A NAME="421"></A>rhapsode to be different from the art of the charioteer?
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes, I remember.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And you admitted that being different they would have 
<A NAME="424"></A>different subjects of knowledge?
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then upon your own showing the rhapsode, and the art 
<A NAME="427"></A>of the rhapsode, will not know everything?
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> I should exclude certain things, 
<A NAME="429"></A>Socrates.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You mean to say that you would exclude pretty much 
<A NAME="431"></A>the subjects of the other arts. As he does not know all of them, which 
<A NAME="432"></A>of them will he know?
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> He will know what a man and what a woman ought to say, 
<A NAME="434"></A>and what a freeman and what a slave ought to say, and what a ruler and 
<A NAME="435"></A>what a subject.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do you mean that a rhapsode will know better than the 
<A NAME="437"></A>pilot what the ruler of a sea-tossed vessel ought to 
<A NAME="438"></A>say?
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> No; the pilot will know best.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Or will the rhapsode know better than the physician 
<A NAME="441"></A>what the ruler of a sick man ought to say?
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> He will not.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But he will know what a slave ought to 
<A NAME="444"></A>say?
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Suppose the slave to be a cowherd; the rhapsode will 
<A NAME="447"></A>know better than the cowherd what he ought to say in order to soothe the 
<A NAME="448"></A>infuriated cows?
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> No, he will not.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But he will know what a spinning-woman ought to say 
<A NAME="451"></A>about the working of wool?
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> No.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> At any rate he will know what a general ought to say 
<A NAME="454"></A>when exhorting his soldiers?
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes, that is the sort of thing which the rhapsode will 
<A NAME="456"></A>be sure to know.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, but is the art of the rhapsode the art of the 
<A NAME="458"></A>general?
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> I am sure that I should know what a general ought to 
<A NAME="460"></A>say.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why, yes, Ion, because you may possibly have a knowledge 
<A NAME="462"></A>of the art of the general as well as of the rhapsode; and you may also 
<A NAME="463"></A>have a knowledge of horsemanship as well as of the lyre: and then you would 
<A NAME="464"></A>know when horses were well or ill managed. But suppose I were to ask you: 
<A NAME="465"></A>By the help of which art, Ion, do you know whether horses are well managed, 
<A NAME="466"></A>by your skill as a horseman or as a performer on the lyre- what would you 
<A NAME="467"></A>answer?
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> I should reply, by my skill as a 
<A NAME="469"></A>horseman.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if you judged of performers on the lyre, you would 
<A NAME="471"></A>admit that you judged of them as a performer on the lyre, and not as a 
<A NAME="472"></A>horseman?
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And in judging of the general's art, do you judge of 
<A NAME="475"></A>it as a general or a rhapsode?
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> To me there appears to be no difference between 
<A NAME="477"></A>them.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What do you mean? Do you mean to say that the art of 
<A NAME="479"></A>the rhapsode and of the general is the same?
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Yes, one and the same.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then he who is a good rhapsode is also a good 
<A NAME="482"></A>general?
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Certainly, Socrates.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And he who is a good general is also a good 
<A NAME="485"></A>rhapsode?
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> No; I do not say that.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But you do say that he who is a good rhapsode is also 
<A NAME="488"></A>a good general.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And you are the best of Hellenic 
<A NAME="491"></A>rhapsodes?
<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Far the best, Socrates.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And are you the best general, Ion?
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> To be sure, Socrates; and Homer was my 
<A NAME="495"></A>master.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But then, Ion, what in the name of goodness can be 
<A NAME="497"></A>the reason why you, who are the best of generals as well as the best of 
<A NAME="498"></A>rhapsodes in all Hellas, go about as a rhapsode when you might be a general? 
<A NAME="499"></A>Do you think that the Hellenes want a rhapsode with his golden crown, and 
<A NAME="500"></A>do not want a general?
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Why, Socrates, the reason is, that my countrymen, the 
<A NAME="502"></A>Ephesians, are the servants and soldiers of Athens, and do not need a general; 
<A NAME="503"></A>and you and Sparta are not likely to have me, for you think that you have 
<A NAME="504"></A>enough generals of your own.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> My good Ion, did you never hear of Apollodorus of 
<A NAME="506"></A>Cyzicus?
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> Who may he be?
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> One who, though a foreigner, has often been chosen 
<A NAME="509"></A>their general by the Athenians: and there is Phanosthenes of Andros, and 
<A NAME="510"></A>Heraclides of Clazomenae, whom they have also appointed to the command 
<A NAME="511"></A>of their armies and to other offices, although aliens, after they had shown 
<A NAME="512"></A>their merit. And will they not choose Ion the Ephesian to be their general, 
<A NAME="513"></A>and honour him, if he prove himself worthy? Were not the Ephesians originally 
<A NAME="514"></A>Athenians, and Ephesus is no mean city? But, indeed, Ion, if you are correct 
<A NAME="515"></A>in saying that by art and knowledge you are able to praise Homer, you do 
<A NAME="516"></A>not deal fairly with me, and after all your professions of knowing many, 
<A NAME="517"></A>glorious things about Homer, and promises that you would exhibit them, 
<A NAME="518"></A>you are only a deceiver, and so far from exhibiting the art of which you 
<A NAME="519"></A>are a master, will not, even after my repeated entreaties, explain to me 
<A NAME="520"></A>the nature of it. You have literally as many forms as Proteus; and now 
<A NAME="521"></A>you go all manner of ways, twisting and turning, and, like Proteus, become 
<A NAME="522"></A>all manner of people at once, and at last slip away from me in the disguise 
<A NAME="523"></A>of a general, in order that you may escape exhibiting your Homeric lore. 
<A NAME="524"></A>And if you have art, then, as I was saying, in falsifying your promise 
<A NAME="525"></A>that you would exhibit Homer, you are not dealing fairly with me. But if, 
<A NAME="526"></A>as I believe, you have no art, but speak all these beautiful words about 
<A NAME="527"></A>Homer unconsciously under his inspiring influence, then I acquit you of 
<A NAME="528"></A>dishonesty, and shall only say that you are inspired. Which do you prefer 
<A NAME="529"></A>to be thought, dishonest or inspired?
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR><B>Ion.</B> There is a great difference, Socrates, between the 
<A NAME="531"></A>two alternatives; and inspiration is by far the nobler.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, Ion, I shall assume the nobler alternative; and 
<A NAME="533"></A>attribute to you in your praises of Homer inspiration, and not 
<A NAME="534"></A>art.
