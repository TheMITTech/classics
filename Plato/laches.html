<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR><B>Lys.</B> You have seen the exhibition of the man fighting in 
<A NAME="18"></A>armour, Nicias and Laches, but we did not tell you at the time the reason 
<A NAME="19"></A>why my friend Melesias and I asked you to go with us and see him. I think 
<A NAME="20"></A>that we may as well confess what this was, for we certainly ought not to 
<A NAME="21"></A>have any reserve with you. The reason was, that we were intending to ask 
<A NAME="22"></A>your advice. Some laugh at the very notion of advising others, and when 
<A NAME="23"></A>they are asked will not say what they think. They guess at the wishes of 
<A NAME="24"></A>the person who asks them, and answer according to his, and not according 
<A NAME="25"></A>to their own, opinion. But as we know that you are good judges, and will 
<A NAME="26"></A>say exactly what you think, we have taken you into our counsels. The matter 
<A NAME="27"></A>about which I am making all this preface is as follows: Melesias and I 
<A NAME="28"></A>have two sons; that is his son, and he is named Thucydides, after his grandfather; 
<A NAME="29"></A>and this is mine, who is also called after his grandfather, Aristides. 
<A NAME="30"></A>Now, we are resolved to take the greatest care of the youths, and not to 
<A NAME="31"></A>let them run about as they like, which is too often the way with the young, 
<A NAME="32"></A>when they are no longer children, but to begin at once and do the utmost 
<A NAME="33"></A>that we can for them. And knowing you to have sons of your own, we thought 
<A NAME="34"></A>that you were most likely to have attended to their training and improvement, 
<A NAME="35"></A>and, if perchance you have not attended to them, we may remind you that 
<A NAME="36"></A>you ought to have done so, and would invite you to assist us in the fulfillment 
<A NAME="37"></A>of a common duty. I will tell you, Nicias and Laches, even at the risk 
<A NAME="38"></A>of being tedious, how we came to think of this. Melesias and I live together, 
<A NAME="39"></A>and our sons live with us; and now, as I was saying at first, we are going 
<A NAME="40"></A>to confess to you. Both of us often talk to the lads about the many noble 
<A NAME="41"></A>deeds which our own fathers did in war and peace-in the management of the 
<A NAME="42"></A>allies, and in the administration of the city; but neither of us has any 
<A NAME="43"></A>deeds of his own which he can show. The truth is that we are ashamed of 
<A NAME="44"></A>this contrast being seen by them, and we blame our fathers for letting 
<A NAME="45"></A>us be spoiled in the days of our youth, while they were occupied with the 
<A NAME="46"></A>concerns of others; and we urge all this upon the lads, pointing out to 
<A NAME="47"></A>them that they will not grow up to honour if they are rebellious and take 
<A NAME="48"></A>no pains about themselves; but that if they take pains they may, perhaps, 
<A NAME="49"></A>become worthy of the names which they bear. They, on their part, promise 
<A NAME="50"></A>to comply with our wishes; and our care is to discover what studies or 
<A NAME="51"></A>pursuits are likely to be most improving to them. Some one commended to 
<A NAME="52"></A>us the art of fighting in armour, which he thought an excellent accomplishment 
<A NAME="53"></A>for a young man to learn; and he praised the man whose exhibition you have 
<A NAME="54"></A>seen, and told us to go and see him. And we determined that we would go, 
<A NAME="55"></A>and get you to accompany us; and we were intending at the same time, if 
<A NAME="56"></A>you did not object, to take counsel with you about the education of our 
<A NAME="57"></A>sons. That is the matter which we wanted to talk over with you; and we 
<A NAME="58"></A>hope that you will give us your opinion about this art of fighting in armour, 
<A NAME="59"></A>and about any other studies or pursuits which may or may not be desirable 
<A NAME="60"></A>for a young man to learn. Please to say whether you agree to our 
<A NAME="61"></A>proposal.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> As far as I am concerned, Lysimachus and Melesias, 
<A NAME="63"></A>I applaud your purpose, and will gladly assist you; and I believe that 
<A NAME="64"></A>you, Laches, will be equally glad.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Certainly, Nicias; and I quite approve of the remark 
<A NAME="66"></A>which Lysimachus made about his own father and the father of Melesias, 
<A NAME="67"></A>and which is applicable, not only to them, but to us, and to every one 
<A NAME="68"></A>who is occupied with public affairs. As he says, such persons are too apt 
<A NAME="69"></A>to be negligent and careless of their own children and their private concerns. 
<A NAME="70"></A>There is much truth in that remark of yours, Lysimachus. But why, instead 
<A NAME="71"></A>of consulting us, do you not consult our friend Socrates about the education 
<A NAME="72"></A>of the youths? He is of the same deme with you, and is always passing his 
<A NAME="73"></A>time in places where the youth have any noble study or pursuit, such as 
<A NAME="74"></A>you are enquiring after.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR><B>Lys.</B> Why, Laches, has Socrates ever attended to matters 
<A NAME="76"></A>of this sort?
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Certainly, Lysimachus.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> That I have the means of knowing as well as Laches; 
<A NAME="79"></A>for quite lately he supplied me with a teacher of music for my sons,-Damon, 
<A NAME="80"></A>the disciple of Agathocles, who is a most accomplished man in every way, 
<A NAME="81"></A>as well as a musician, and a companion of inestimable value for young men 
<A NAME="82"></A>at their age.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR><B>Lys.</B> Those who have reached my time of life, Socrates and 
<A NAME="84"></A>Nicias and Laches, fall out of acquaintance with the young, because they 
<A NAME="85"></A>are generally detained at home by old age; but you, O son of Sophroniscus, 
<A NAME="86"></A>should let your fellow demesman have the benefits of any advice which you 
<A NAME="87"></A>are able to give. Moreover I have a claim upon you as an old friend of 
<A NAME="88"></A>your father; for I and he were always companions and friends, and to the 
<A NAME="89"></A>hour of his death there never was a difference between us; and now it comes 
<A NAME="90"></A>back to me, at the mention of your name, that I have heard these lads talking 
<A NAME="91"></A>to one another at home, and often speaking of Socrates in terms of the 
<A NAME="92"></A>highest praise; but I have never thought to ask them whether the son of 
<A NAME="93"></A>Sophroniscus was the person whom they meant. Tell me, my boys, whether 
<A NAME="94"></A>this is the Socrates of whom you have often spoken?
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR><B>Son.</B> Certainly, father, this is he.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR><B>Lys.</B> I am delighted to hear, Socrates, that you maintain 
<A NAME="97"></A>the name of your father, who was a most excellent man; and I further rejoice 
<A NAME="98"></A>at the prospect of our family ties being renewed.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Indeed, Lysimachus, you ought not to give him up; for 
<A NAME="100"></A>I can assure you that I have seen him maintaining, not only his father's, 
<A NAME="101"></A>but also his country's name. He was my companion in the retreat from Delium, 
<A NAME="102"></A>and I can tell you that if others had only been like him, the honour of 
<A NAME="103"></A>our country would have been upheld, and the great defeat would never have 
<A NAME="104"></A>occurred.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR><B>Lys.</B> That is very high praise which is accorded to you, 
<A NAME="106"></A>Socrates, by faithful witnesses and for actions like those which they praise. 
<A NAME="107"></A>Let me tell you the pleasure which I feel in hearing of your fame; and 
<A NAME="108"></A>I hope that you will regard me as one of your warmest friends. You ought 
<A NAME="109"></A>to have visited us long ago, and made yourself at home with us; but now, 
<A NAME="110"></A>from this day forward, as we have at last found one another out, do as 
<A NAME="111"></A>I say-come and make acquaintance with me, and with these young men, that 
<A NAME="112"></A>I may continue your friend, as I was your father's. I shall expect you 
<A NAME="113"></A>to do so, and shall venture at some future time to remind you of your duty. 
<A NAME="114"></A>But what say you of the matter of which we were beginning to speak-the 
<A NAME="115"></A>art of fighting in armour? Is that a practice in which the lads may be 
<A NAME="116"></A>advantageously instructed?
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I will endeavour to advise you, Lysimachus, as far 
<A NAME="118"></A>as I can in this matter, and also in every way will comply with your wishes; 
<A NAME="119"></A>but as I am younger and not so experienced, I think that I ought certainly 
<A NAME="120"></A>to hear first what my elders have to say, and to learn of them, and if 
<A NAME="121"></A>I have anything to add, then I may venture to give my opinion to them as 
<A NAME="122"></A>well as to you. Suppose, Nicias, that one or other of you 
<A NAME="123"></A>begin.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> I have no objection, Socrates; and my opinion is that 
<A NAME="125"></A>the acquirement of this art is in many ways useful to young men. It is 
<A NAME="126"></A>an advantage to them that among the favourite amusements of their leisure 
<A NAME="127"></A>hours they should have one which tends to improve and not to injure their 
<A NAME="128"></A>bodily health. No gymnastics could be better or harder exercise; and this, 
<A NAME="129"></A>and the art of riding, are of all arts most befitting to a freeman; for 
<A NAME="130"></A>they only who are thus trained in the use of arms are the athletes of our 
<A NAME="131"></A>military profession, trained in that on which the conflict turns. Moreover 
<A NAME="132"></A>in actual battle, when you have to fight in a line with a number of others, 
<A NAME="133"></A>such an acquirement will be of some use, and will be of the greatest whenever 
<A NAME="134"></A>the ranks are broken and you have to fight singly, either in pursuit, when 
<A NAME="135"></A>you are attacking some one who is defending himself, or in flight, when 
<A NAME="136"></A>you have to defend yourself against an assailant. Certainly he who possessed 
<A NAME="137"></A>the art could not meet with any harm at the hands of a single person, or 
<A NAME="138"></A>perhaps of several; and in any case he would have a great advantage. Further, 
<A NAME="139"></A>this sort of skill inclines a man to the love of other noble lessons; for 
<A NAME="140"></A>every man who has learned how to fight in armour will desire to learn the 
<A NAME="141"></A>proper arrangement of an army, which is the sequel of the lesson: and when 
<A NAME="142"></A>he has learned this, and his ambition is once fired, he will go on to learn 
<A NAME="143"></A>the complete art of the general. There is no difficulty in seeing that 
<A NAME="144"></A>the knowledge and practice of other military arts will be honourable and 
<A NAME="145"></A>valuable to a man; and this lesson may be the beginning of them. Let me 
<A NAME="146"></A>add a further advantage, which is by no means a slight one,-that this science 
<A NAME="147"></A>will make any man a great deal more valiant and self-possessed in the field. 
<A NAME="148"></A>And I will not disdain to mention, what by some may he thought to be a 
<A NAME="149"></A>small matter;-he will make a better appearance at the right time; that 
<A NAME="150"></A>is to say, at the time when his appearance will strike terror into his 
<A NAME="151"></A>enemies. My opinion then, Lysimachus, is, as I say, that the youths should 
<A NAME="152"></A>be instructed in this art, and for the reasons which I have given. But 
<A NAME="153"></A>Laches may take a different view; and I shall be very glad to hear what 
<A NAME="154"></A>he has to say.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> I should not like to maintain, Nicias, that any kind 
<A NAME="156"></A>of knowledge is not to be learned; for all knowledge appears to be a good: 
<A NAME="157"></A>and if, as Nicias and as the teachers of the art affirm, this use of arms 
<A NAME="158"></A>is really a species of knowledge, then it ought to be learned; but if not, 
<A NAME="159"></A>and if those who profess to teach it are deceivers only; or if it be knowledge, 
<A NAME="160"></A>but not of a valuable sort, then what is the use of learning it? I say 
<A NAME="161"></A>this, because I think that if it had been really valuable, the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="162"></A>whose whole life is passed in finding out and practising the arts which 
<A NAME="163"></A>give them an advantage over other nations in war, would have discovered 
<A NAME="164"></A>this one. And even if they had not, still these professors of the art would 
<A NAME="165"></A>certainly not have failed to discover that of all the Hellenes the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="166"></A>have the greatest interest in such matters, and that a master of the art 
<A NAME="167"></A>who was honoured among them would be sure to make his fortune among other 
<A NAME="168"></A>nations, just as a tragic poet would who is honoured among ourselves; which 
<A NAME="169"></A>is the reason why he who fancies that he can write a tragedy does not go 
<A NAME="170"></A>about itinerating in the neighbouring states, but rushes straight, and 
<A NAME="171"></A>exhibits at Athens; and this is natural. Whereas I perceive that these 
<A NAME="172"></A>fighters in armour regard Lacedaemon as a sacred inviolable territory, 
<A NAME="173"></A>which they do not touch with the point of their foot; but they make a circuit 
<A NAME="174"></A>of the neighbouring states, and would rather exhibit to any others than 
<A NAME="175"></A>to the Spartans; and particularly to those who would themselves acknowledge 
<A NAME="176"></A>that they are by no means first-rate in the arts of war. Further, Lysimachus, 
<A NAME="177"></A>I have encountered a good many of these gentlemen in actual service, and 
<A NAME="178"></A>have taken their measure, which I can give you at once; for none of these 
<A NAME="179"></A>masters of fence have ever been distinguished in war,-there has been a 
<A NAME="180"></A>sort of fatality about them; while in all other arts the men of note have 
<A NAME="181"></A>been always those who have practised the art, they appear to be a most 
<A NAME="182"></A>unfortunate exception. For example, this very Stesilaus, whom you and I 
<A NAME="183"></A>have just witnessed exhibiting in all that crowd and making such great 
<A NAME="184"></A>professions of his powers, I have seen at another time making, in sober 
<A NAME="185"></A>truth, an involuntary exhibition of himself, which was a far better spectacle. 
<A NAME="186"></A>He was a marine on board a ship which struck a transport vessel, and was 
<A NAME="187"></A>armed with a weapon, half spear half scythe; the singularity of this weapon 
<A NAME="188"></A>was worthy of the singularity of the man. To make a long story short, I 
<A NAME="189"></A>will only tell you what happened to this notable invention of the scythe-spear. 
<A NAME="190"></A>He was fighting, and the scythe was caught in the rigging of the other 
<A NAME="191"></A>ship, and stuck fast; and he tugged, but was unable to get his weapon free. 
<A NAME="192"></A>The two ships were passing one another. He first ran along his own ship 
<A NAME="193"></A>holding on to the spear; but as the other ship passed by and drew him after 
<A NAME="194"></A>as he was holding on, he let the spear slip through his hand until he retained 
<A NAME="195"></A>only the end of the handle. The people in the transport clapped their hands, 
<A NAME="196"></A>and laughed at his ridiculous figure; and when some one threw a stone, 
<A NAME="197"></A>which fell on the deck at his feet, and he quitted of the scythe-spear, 
<A NAME="198"></A>the crew of his own trireme also burst out laughing; they could not refrain 
<A NAME="199"></A>when they beheld the weapon waving in the air, suspended from the transport. 
<A NAME="200"></A>Now I do not deny that there may be something in such an art, as Nicias 
<A NAME="201"></A>asserts, but I tell you my experience; and, as I said at first, whether 
<A NAME="202"></A>this be an art of which the advantage is so slight, or not an art at all, 
<A NAME="203"></A>but only an imposition, in either case such an acquirement is not worth 
<A NAME="204"></A>having. For my opinion is, that if the professor of this art be a coward, 
<A NAME="205"></A>he will be likely to become rash, and his character will be only more notorious; 
<A NAME="206"></A>or if he be brave, and fail ever so little, other men will be on the watch, 
<A NAME="207"></A>and he will be greatly traduced; for there is a jealousy of such pretenders; 
<A NAME="208"></A>and unless a man be preeminent in valour, he cannot help being ridiculous, 
<A NAME="209"></A>if he says that he has this sort of skill. Such is my judgment, Lysimachus, 
<A NAME="210"></A>of the desirableness of this art; but, as I said at first, ask Socrates, 
<A NAME="211"></A>and do not let him go until he has given you his opinion of the 
<A NAME="212"></A>matter.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR><B>Lys.</B> I am going to ask this favour of you, Socrates; as 
<A NAME="214"></A>is the more necessary because the two councillors disagree, and some one 
<A NAME="215"></A>is in a manner still needed who will decide between them. Had they agreed, 
<A NAME="216"></A>no arbiter would have been required. But as Laches has voted one way and 
<A NAME="217"></A>Nicias another, I should like to hear with which of our two friends you 
<A NAME="218"></A>agree.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What, Lysimachus, are you going to accept the opinion 
<A NAME="220"></A>of the majority?
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR><B>Lys.</B> Why, yes, Socrates; what else am I to 
<A NAME="222"></A>do?
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And would you do so too, Melesias? If you were deliberating 
<A NAME="224"></A>about the gymnastic training of your son, would you follow the advice of 
<A NAME="225"></A>the majority of us, or the opinion of the one who had been trained and 
<A NAME="226"></A>exercised under a skilful master?
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR><B>Mel.</B> The latter, Socrates; as would surely be 
<A NAME="228"></A>reasonable.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> His one vote would be worth more than the vote of all 
<A NAME="230"></A>us four?
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR><B>Mel.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And for this reason, as I imagine,-because a good decision 
<A NAME="233"></A>is based on knowledge and not on numbers?
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR><B>Mel.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Must we not then first of all ask, whether there is 
<A NAME="236"></A>any one of us who has knowledge of that about which we are deliberating? 
<A NAME="237"></A>If there is, let us take his advice, though he be one only, and not mind 
<A NAME="238"></A>the rest; if there is not, let us seek further counsel. Is this a slight 
<A NAME="239"></A>matter about which you and Lysimachus are deliberating? Are you not risking 
<A NAME="240"></A>the greatest of your possessions? For children are your riches; and upon 
<A NAME="241"></A>their turning out well or ill depends the whole order of their father's 
<A NAME="242"></A>house.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR><B>Mel.</B> That is true.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Great care, then, is required in this 
<A NAME="245"></A>matter?
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR><B>Mel.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Suppose, as I was just now saying, that we were considering, 
<A NAME="248"></A>or wanting to consider, who was the best trainer. Should we not select 
<A NAME="249"></A>him who knew and had practised the art, and had the best 
<A NAME="250"></A>teachers?
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR><B>Mel.</B> I think that we should.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But would there not arise a prior question about the 
<A NAME="253"></A>nature of the art of which we want to find the masters?
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR><B>Mel.</B> I do not understand.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let me try to make my meaning plainer then. I do not 
<A NAME="256"></A>think that we have as yet decided what that is about which we are consulting, 
<A NAME="257"></A>when we ask which of us is or is not skilled in the art, and has or has 
<A NAME="258"></A>not had a teacher of the art.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> Why, Socrates, is not the question whether young men 
<A NAME="260"></A>ought or ought not to learn the art of fighting in armour?
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, Nicias; but there is also a prior question, which 
<A NAME="262"></A>I may illustrate in this way: When a person considers about applying a 
<A NAME="263"></A>medicine to the eyes, would you say that he is consulting about the medicine 
<A NAME="264"></A>or about the eyes?
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> About the eyes.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And when he considers whether he shall set a bridle 
<A NAME="267"></A>on a horse and at what time, he is thinking of the horse and not of the 
<A NAME="268"></A>bridle?
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> True.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And in a word, when he considers anything for the sake 
<A NAME="271"></A>of another thing, he thinks of the end and not of the 
<A NAME="272"></A>means?
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And when you call in an adviser, you should see whether 
<A NAME="275"></A>he too is skilful in the accomplishment of the end which you have in 
<A NAME="276"></A>view?
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And at present we have in view some knowledge, of which 
<A NAME="279"></A>the end is the soul of youth?
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And we are enquiring, Which of us is skilful or successful 
<A NAME="282"></A>in the treatment of the soul, and which of us has had good 
<A NAME="283"></A>teachers?
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Well but, Socrates; did you never observe that some 
<A NAME="285"></A>persons, who have had no teachers, are more skilful than those who have, 
<A NAME="286"></A>in some things?
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, Laches, I have observed that; but you would not 
<A NAME="288"></A>be very willing to trust them if they only professed to be masters of their 
<A NAME="289"></A>art, unless they could show some proof of their skill or excellence in 
<A NAME="290"></A>one or more works.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> That is true.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And therefore, Laches and Nicias, as Lysimachus and 
<A NAME="293"></A>Melesias, in their anxiety to improve the minds of their sons, have asked 
<A NAME="294"></A>our advice about them, we too should tell them who our teachers were, if 
<A NAME="295"></A>we say that we have had any, and prove them to be in the first place men 
<A NAME="296"></A>of merit and experienced trainers of the minds of youth and also to have 
<A NAME="297"></A>been really our teachers. Or if any of us says that he has no teacher, 
<A NAME="298"></A>but that he has works of his own to show; then he should point out to them 
<A NAME="299"></A>what Athenians or strangers, bond or free, he is generally acknowledged 
<A NAME="300"></A>to have improved. But if he can show neither teachers nor works, then he 
<A NAME="301"></A>should tell them to look out for others; and not run the risk of spoiling 
<A NAME="302"></A>the children of friends, and thereby incurring the most formidable accusation 
<A NAME="303"></A>which can be brought against any one by those nearest to him. As for myself, 
<A NAME="304"></A>Lysimachus and Melesias, I am the first to confess that I have never had 
<A NAME="305"></A>a teacher of the art of virtue; although I have always from my earliest 
<A NAME="306"></A>youth desired to have one. But I am too poor to give money to the Sophists, 
<A NAME="307"></A>who are the only professors of moral improvement; and to this day I have 
<A NAME="308"></A>never been able to discover the art myself, though I should not be surprised 
<A NAME="309"></A>if Nicias or Laches may have discovered or learned it; for they are far 
<A NAME="310"></A>wealthier than I am, and may therefore have learnt of others. And they 
<A NAME="311"></A>are older too; so that they have had more time to make the discovery. And 
<A NAME="312"></A>I really believe that they are able to educate a man; for unless they had 
<A NAME="313"></A>been confident in their own knowledge, they would never have spoken thus 
<A NAME="314"></A>decidedly of the pursuits which are advantageous or hurtful to a young 
<A NAME="315"></A>man. I repose confidence in both of them; but I am surprised to find that 
<A NAME="316"></A>they differ from one another. And therefore, Lysimachus, as Laches suggested 
<A NAME="317"></A>that you should detain me, and not let me go until I answered, I in turn 
<A NAME="318"></A>earnestly beseech and advise you to detain Laches and Nicias, and question 
<A NAME="319"></A>them. I would have you say to them: Socrates avers that he has no knowledge 
<A NAME="320"></A>of the matter-he is unable to decide which of you speaks truly; neither 
<A NAME="321"></A>discoverer nor student is he of anything of the kind. But you, Laches and 
<A NAME="322"></A>Nicias, should each of you tell us who is the most skilful educator whom 
<A NAME="323"></A>you have ever known; and whether you invented the art yourselves, or learned 
<A NAME="324"></A>of another; and if you learned, who were your respective teachers, and 
<A NAME="325"></A>who were their brothers in the art; and then, if you are too much occupied 
<A NAME="326"></A>in politics to teach us yourselves, let us go to them, and present them 
<A NAME="327"></A>with gifts, or make interest with them, or both, in the hope that they 
<A NAME="328"></A>may be induced to take charge of our children and of yours; and then they 
<A NAME="329"></A>will not grow up inferior, and disgrace their ancestors. But if you are 
<A NAME="330"></A>yourselves original discoverers in that field, give us some proof of your 
<A NAME="331"></A>skill. Who are they who, having been inferior persons, have become under 
<A NAME="332"></A>your care good and noble? For if this is your first attempt at education, 
<A NAME="333"></A>there is a danger that you may be trying the experiment, not on the "vile 
<A NAME="334"></A>corpus" of a Carian slave, but on your own sons, or the sons of your friend, 
<A NAME="335"></A>and, as the proverb says, "break the large vessel in learning to make pots." 
<A NAME="336"></A>Tell us then, what qualities you claim or do not claim. Make them tell 
<A NAME="337"></A>you that, Lysimachus, and do not let them off.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR><B>Lys.</B> I very much approve of the words of Socrates, my friends; 
<A NAME="339"></A>but you, Nicias and Laches, must determine whether you will be questioned, 
<A NAME="340"></A>and give an explanation about matters of this sort. Assuredly, I and Melesias 
<A NAME="341"></A>would be greatly pleased to hear you answer the questions which Socrates 
<A NAME="342"></A>asks, if you will: for I began by saying that we took you into our counsels 
<A NAME="343"></A>because we thought that you would have attended to the subject, especially 
<A NAME="344"></A>as you have children who, like our own, are nearly of an age to be educated. 
<A NAME="345"></A>Well, then, if you have no objection, suppose that you take Socrates into 
<A NAME="346"></A>partnership; and do you and he ask and answer one another's questions: 
<A NAME="347"></A>for, as he has well said, we are deliberating about the most important 
<A NAME="348"></A>of our concerns. I hope that you will see fit to comply with our 
<A NAME="349"></A>request.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> I see very clearly, Lysimachus, that you have only 
<A NAME="351"></A>known Socrates' father, and have no acquaintance with Socrates himself: 
<A NAME="352"></A>at least, you can only have known him when he was a child, and may have 
<A NAME="353"></A>met him among his fellow wardsmen, in company with his father, at a sacrifice, 
<A NAME="354"></A>or at some other gathering. You clearly show that you have never known 
<A NAME="355"></A>him since he arrived at manhood.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR><B>Lys.</B> Why do you say that, Nicias?
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> Because you seem not to be aware that any one who has 
<A NAME="358"></A>an intellectual affinity to Socrates and enters into conversation with 
<A NAME="359"></A>him is liable to be drawn into an argument; and whatever subject he may 
<A NAME="360"></A>start, he will be continually carried round and round by him, until at 
<A NAME="361"></A>last he finds that he has to give an account both of his present and past 
<A NAME="362"></A>life; and when he is once entangled, Socrates will not let him go until 
<A NAME="363"></A>he has completely and thoroughly sifted him. Now I am used to his ways; 
<A NAME="364"></A>and I know that he will certainly do as I say, and also that I myself shall 
<A NAME="365"></A>be the sufferer; for I am fond of his conversation, Lysimachus. And I think 
<A NAME="366"></A>that there is no harm in being reminded of any wrong thing which we are, 
<A NAME="367"></A>or have been, doing: he who does not fly from reproof will be sure to take 
<A NAME="368"></A>more heed of his after-life; as Solon says, he will wish and desire to 
<A NAME="369"></A>be learning so long as he lives, and will not think that old age of itself 
<A NAME="370"></A>brings wisdom. To me, to be cross examined by Socrates is neither unusual 
<A NAME="371"></A>nor unpleasant; indeed, I knew all along that where Socrates was, the argument 
<A NAME="372"></A>would soon pass from our sons to ourselves; and therefore, I say that for 
<A NAME="373"></A>my part, I am quite willing to discourse with Socrates in his own manner; 
<A NAME="374"></A>but you had better ask our friend Laches what his feeling may 
<A NAME="375"></A>be.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> I have but one feeling, Nicias, or (shall I say?) two 
<A NAME="377"></A>feelings, about discussions. Some would think that I am a lover, and to 
<A NAME="378"></A>others I may seem to be a hater of discourse; for when I hear a man discoursing 
<A NAME="379"></A>of virtue, or of any sort of wisdom, who is a true man and worthy of his 
<A NAME="380"></A>theme, I am delighted beyond measure: and I compare the man and his words, 
<A NAME="381"></A>and note the harmony and correspondence of them. And such an one I deem 
<A NAME="382"></A>to be the true musician, attuned to a fairer harmony than that of the lyre, 
<A NAME="383"></A>or any pleasant instrument of music; for truly he has in his own life a 
<A NAME="384"></A>harmony of words and deeds arranged, not in the Ionian, or in the Phrygian 
<A NAME="385"></A>mode, nor yet in the Lydian, but in the true Hellenic mode, which is the 
<A NAME="386"></A>Dorian, and no other. Such an one makes me merry with the sound of his 
<A NAME="387"></A>voice; and when I hear him I am thought to be a lover of discourse; so 
<A NAME="388"></A>eager am I in drinking in his words. But a man whose actions do not agree 
<A NAME="389"></A>with his words is an annoyance to me; and the better he speaks the more 
<A NAME="390"></A>I hate him, and then I seem to be a hater of discourse. As to Socrates, 
<A NAME="391"></A>I have no knowledge of his words, but of old, as would seem, I have had 
<A NAME="392"></A>experience of his deeds; and his deeds show that free and noble sentiments 
<A NAME="393"></A>are natural to him. And if his words accord, then I am of one mind with 
<A NAME="394"></A>him, and shall be delighted to be interrogated by a man such as he is, 
<A NAME="395"></A>and shall not be annoyed at having to learn of him: for I too agree with 
<A NAME="396"></A>Solon, "that I would fain grow old, learning many things." But I must be 
<A NAME="397"></A>allowed to add "of the good only." Socrates must be willing to allow that 
<A NAME="398"></A>he is a good teacher, or I shall be a dull and uncongenial pupil: but that 
<A NAME="399"></A>the teacher is younger, or not as yet in repute-anything of that sort is 
<A NAME="400"></A>of no account with me. And therefore, Socrates, I give you notice that 
<A NAME="401"></A>you may teach and confute me as much as ever you like, and also learn of 
<A NAME="402"></A>me anything which I know. So high is the opinion which I have entertained 
<A NAME="403"></A>of you ever since the day on which you were my companion in danger, and 
<A NAME="404"></A>gave a proof of your valour such as only the man of merit can give. Therefore, 
<A NAME="405"></A>say whatever you like, and do not mind about the difference of our 
<A NAME="406"></A>ages.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I cannot say that either of you show any reluctance 
<A NAME="408"></A>to take counsel and advise with me.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR><B>Lys.</B> But this is our proper business; and yours as well 
<A NAME="410"></A>as ours, for I reckon you as one of us. Please then to take my place, and 
<A NAME="411"></A>find out from Nicias and Laches what we want to know, for the sake of the 
<A NAME="412"></A>youths, and talk and consult with them: for I am old, and my memory is 
<A NAME="413"></A>bad; and I do not remember the questions which I am going to ask, or the 
<A NAME="414"></A>answers to them; and if there is any interruption I am quite lost. I will 
<A NAME="415"></A>therefore beg of you to carry on the proposed discussion by yourselves; 
<A NAME="416"></A>and I will listen, and Melesias and I will act upon your 
<A NAME="417"></A>conclusions.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let us, Nicias and Laches, comply with the request 
<A NAME="419"></A>of Lysimachus and Melesias. There will be no harm in asking ourselves the 
<A NAME="420"></A>question which was first proposed to us: "Who have been our own instructors 
<A NAME="421"></A>in this sort of training, and whom have we made better?" But the other 
<A NAME="422"></A>mode of carrying on the enquiry will bring us equally to the same point, 
<A NAME="423"></A>and will be more like proceeding from first principles. For if we knew 
<A NAME="424"></A>that the addition of something would improve some other thing, and were 
<A NAME="425"></A>able to make the addition, then, clearly, we must know how that about which 
<A NAME="426"></A>we are advising may be best and most easily attained. Perhaps you do not 
<A NAME="427"></A>understand what I mean. Then let me make my meaning plainer in this way. 
<A NAME="428"></A>Suppose we knew that the addition of sight makes better the eyes which 
<A NAME="429"></A>possess this gift, and also were able to impart sight to the eyes, then, 
<A NAME="430"></A>clearly, we should know the nature of sight, and should be able to advise 
<A NAME="431"></A>how this gift of sight may be best and most easily attained; but if we 
<A NAME="432"></A>knew neither what sight is, nor what hearing is, we should not be very 
<A NAME="433"></A>good medical advisers about the eyes or the ears, or about the best mode 
<A NAME="434"></A>of giving sight and hearing to them.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> That is true, Socrates.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And are not our two friends, Laches, at this very moment 
<A NAME="437"></A>inviting us to consider in what way the gift of virtue may be imparted 
<A NAME="438"></A>to their sons for the improvement of their minds?
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then must we not first know the nature of virtue? For 
<A NAME="441"></A>how can we advise any one about the best mode of attaining something of 
<A NAME="442"></A>which we are wholly ignorant?
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> I do not think that we can, Socrates.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, Laches, we may presume that we know the nature 
<A NAME="445"></A>of virtue?
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And that which we know we must surely be able to 
<A NAME="448"></A>tell?
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I would not have us begin, my friend, with enquiring 
<A NAME="451"></A>about the whole of virtue; for that may be more than we can accomplish; 
<A NAME="452"></A>let us first consider whether we have a sufficient knowledge of a part; 
<A NAME="453"></A>the enquiry will thus probably be made easier to us.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Let us do as you say, Socrates.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then which of the parts of virtue shall we select? 
<A NAME="456"></A>Must we not select that to which the art of fighting in armour is supposed 
<A NAME="457"></A>to conduce? And is not that generally thought to be 
<A NAME="458"></A>courage?
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Yes, certainly.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, Laches, suppose that we first set about determining 
<A NAME="461"></A>the nature of courage, and in the second place proceed to enquire how the 
<A NAME="462"></A>young men may attain this quality by the help of studies and pursuits. 
<A NAME="463"></A>Tell me, if you can, what is courage.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Indeed, Socrates, I see no difficulty in answering; 
<A NAME="465"></A>he is a man of courage who does not run away, but remains at his post and 
<A NAME="466"></A>fights against the enemy; there can be no mistake about 
<A NAME="467"></A>that.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Very good, Laches; and yet I fear that I did not express 
<A NAME="469"></A>myself clearly; and therefore you have answered not the question which 
<A NAME="470"></A>I intended to ask, but another.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> What do you mean, Socrates?
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I will endeavour to explain; you would call a man courageous 
<A NAME="473"></A>who remains at his post, and fights with the enemy?
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Certainly I should.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And so should I; but what would you say of another 
<A NAME="476"></A>man, who fights flying, instead of remaining?
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> How flying?
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why, as the Scythians are said to fight, flying as 
<A NAME="479"></A>well as pursuing; and as Homer says in praise of the horses of Aeneas, 
<A NAME="480"></A>that they knew "how to pursue, and fly quickly hither and thither"; and 
<A NAME="481"></A>he passes an encomium on Aeneas himself, as having a knowledge of fear 
<A NAME="482"></A>or flight, and calls him "an author of fear or flight."
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Yes, Socrates, and there Homer is right: for he was 
<A NAME="484"></A>speaking of chariots, as you were speaking of the Scythian cavalry, who 
<A NAME="485"></A>have that way of fighting; but the heavy-armed Greek fights, as I say, 
<A NAME="486"></A>remaining in his rank.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And yet, Laches, you must except the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="488"></A>at Plataea, who, when they came upon the light shields of the Persians, 
<A NAME="489"></A>are said not to have been willing to stand and fight, and to have fled; 
<A NAME="490"></A>but when the ranks of the Persians were broken, they turned upon them like 
<A NAME="491"></A>cavalry, and won the battle of Plataea.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> That is true.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That was my meaning when I said that I was to blame 
<A NAME="494"></A>in having put my question badly, and that this was the reason of your answering 
<A NAME="495"></A>badly. For I meant to ask you not only about the courage of heavy-armed 
<A NAME="496"></A>soldiers, but about the courage of cavalry and every other style of soldier; 
<A NAME="497"></A>and not only who are courageous in war, but who are courageous in perils 
<A NAME="498"></A>by sea, and who in disease, or in poverty, or again in politics, are courageous; 
<A NAME="499"></A>and not only who are courageous against pain or fear, but mighty to contend 
<A NAME="500"></A>against desires and pleasures, either fixed in their rank or turning upon 
<A NAME="501"></A>their enemy. There is this sort of courage-is there not, 
<A NAME="502"></A>Laches?
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Certainly, Socrates.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And all these are courageous, but some have courage 
<A NAME="505"></A>in pleasures, and some in pains: some in desires, and some in fears, and 
<A NAME="506"></A>some are cowards under the same conditions, as I should 
<A NAME="507"></A>imagine.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Now I was asking about courage and cowardice in general. 
<A NAME="510"></A>And I will begin with courage, and once more ask, What is that common quality, 
<A NAME="511"></A>which is the same in all these cases, and which is called courage? Do you 
<A NAME="512"></A>now understand what I mean?
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Not over well.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I mean this: As I might ask what is that quality which 
<A NAME="515"></A>is called quickness, and which is found in running, in playing the lyre, 
<A NAME="516"></A>in speaking, in learning, and in many other similar actions, or rather 
<A NAME="517"></A>which we possess in nearly every action that is worth mentioning of arms, 
<A NAME="518"></A>legs, mouth, voice, mind;-would you not apply the term quickness to all 
<A NAME="519"></A>of them?
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And suppose I were to be asked by some one: What is 
<A NAME="522"></A>that common quality, Socrates, which, in all these uses of the word, you 
<A NAME="523"></A>call quickness? I should say the quality which accomplishes much in a little 
<A NAME="524"></A>time-whether in running, speaking, or in any other sort of 
<A NAME="525"></A>action.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> You would be quite correct.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And now, Laches, do you try and tell me in like manner, 
<A NAME="528"></A>What is that common quality which is called courage, and which includes 
<A NAME="529"></A>all the various uses of the term when applied both to pleasure and pain, 
<A NAME="530"></A>and in all the cases to which I was just now referring?
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> I should say that courage is a sort of endurance of 
<A NAME="532"></A>the soul, if I am to speak of the universal nature which pervades them 
<A NAME="533"></A>all.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But that is what we must do if we are to answer the 
<A NAME="535"></A>question. And yet I cannot say that every kind of endurance is, in my opinion, 
<A NAME="536"></A>to be deemed courage. Hear my reason: I am sure, Laches, that you would 
<A NAME="537"></A>consider courage to be a very noble quality.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Most noble, certainly.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And you would say that a wise endurance is also good 
<A NAME="540"></A>and noble?
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Very noble.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But what would you say of a foolish endurance? Is not 
<A NAME="543"></A>that, on the other hand, to be regarded as evil and 
<A NAME="544"></A>hurtful?
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> True.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is anything noble which is evil and 
<A NAME="547"></A>hurtful?
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> I ought not to say that, Socrates.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then you would not admit that sort of endurance to 
<A NAME="550"></A>be courage-for it is not noble, but courage is noble?
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> You are right.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, according to you, only the wise endurance is 
<A NAME="553"></A>courage?
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> True.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But as to the epithet "wise,"-wise in what? In all 
<A NAME="556"></A>things small as well as great? For example, if a man shows the quality 
<A NAME="557"></A>of endurance in spending his money wisely, knowing that by spending he 
<A NAME="558"></A>will acquire more in the end, do you call him courageous?
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Assuredly not.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Or, for example, if a man is a physician, and his son, 
<A NAME="561"></A>or some patient of his, has inflammation of the lungs, and begs that he 
<A NAME="562"></A>may be allowed to eat or drink something, and the other is firm and refuses; 
<A NAME="563"></A>is that courage?
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> No; that is not courage at all, any more than the 
<A NAME="565"></A>last.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Again, take the case of one who endures in war, and 
<A NAME="567"></A>is willing to fight, and wisely calculates and knows that others will help 
<A NAME="568"></A>him, and that there will be fewer and inferior men against him than there 
<A NAME="569"></A>are with him; and suppose that he has also advantages of position; would 
<A NAME="570"></A>you say of such a one who endures with all this wisdom and preparation, 
<A NAME="571"></A>that he, or some man in the opposing army who is in the opposite circumstances 
<A NAME="572"></A>to these and yet endures and remains at his post, is the 
<A NAME="573"></A>braver?
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> I should say that the latter, Socrates, was the 
<A NAME="575"></A>braver.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But, surely, this is a foolish endurance in comparison 
<A NAME="577"></A>with the other?
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> That is true.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then you would say that he who in an engagement of 
<A NAME="580"></A>cavalry endures, having the knowledge of horsemanship, is not so courageous 
<A NAME="581"></A>as he who endures, having no such knowledge?
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> So I should say.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And he who endures, having a knowledge of the use of 
<A NAME="584"></A>the sling, or the bow, or of any other art, is not so courageous as he 
<A NAME="585"></A>who endures, not having such a knowledge?
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> True.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And he who descends into a well, and dives, and holds 
<A NAME="588"></A>out in this or any similar action, having no knowledge of diving, or the 
<A NAME="589"></A>like, is, as you would say, more courageous than those who have this 
<A NAME="590"></A>knowledge?
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Why, Socrates, what else can a man 
<A NAME="592"></A>say?
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Nothing, if that be what he thinks.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> But that is what I do think.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And yet men who thus run risks and endure are foolish, 
<A NAME="596"></A>Laches, in comparison of those who do the same things, having the skill 
<A NAME="597"></A>to do them.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> That is true.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But foolish boldness and endurance appeared before 
<A NAME="600"></A>to be base and hurtful to us.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Whereas courage was acknowledged to be a noble 
<A NAME="603"></A>quality.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> True.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And now on the contrary we are saying that the foolish 
<A NAME="606"></A>endurance, which was before held in dishonour, is courage.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And are we right in saying so?
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Indeed, Socrates, I am sure that we are not 
<A NAME="610"></A>right.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then according to your statement, you and I, Laches, 
<A NAME="612"></A>are not attuned to the Dorian mode, which is a harmony of words and deeds; 
<A NAME="613"></A>for our deeds are not in accordance with our words. Any one would say that 
<A NAME="614"></A>we had courage who saw us in action, but not, I imagine, he who heard us 
<A NAME="615"></A>talking about courage just now.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> That is most true.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is this condition of ours satisfactory?
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Quite the reverse.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Suppose, however, that we admit the principle of which 
<A NAME="620"></A>we are speaking to a certain extent.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> To what extent and what principle do you 
<A NAME="622"></A>mean?
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The principle of endurance. We too must endure and 
<A NAME="624"></A>persevere in the enquiry, and then courage will not laugh at our faintheartedness 
<A NAME="625"></A>in searching for courage; which after all may, very likely, be 
<A NAME="626"></A>endurance.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> I am ready to go on, Socrates; and yet I am unused to 
<A NAME="628"></A>investigations of this sort. But the spirit of controversy has been aroused 
<A NAME="629"></A>in me by what has been said; and I am really grieved at being thus unable 
<A NAME="630"></A>to-express my meaning. For I fancy that I do know the nature of courage; 
<A NAME="631"></A>but, somehow or other, she has slipped away from me, and I cannot get hold 
<A NAME="632"></A>of her and tell her nature.
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But, my dear friend, should not the good sportsman 
<A NAME="634"></A>follow the track, and not be lazy?
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Certainly, he should.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And shall we invite Nicias to join us? he may be better 
<A NAME="637"></A>at the sport than we are. What do you say?
<A NAME="638"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> I should like that.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Come then, Nicias, and do what you can to help your 
<A NAME="640"></A>friends, who are tossing on the waves of argument, and at the last gasp: 
<A NAME="641"></A>you see our extremity, and may save us and also settle your own opinion, 
<A NAME="642"></A>if you will tell us what you think about courage.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> I have been thinking, Socrates, that you and Laches 
<A NAME="644"></A>are not defining courage in the right way; for you have forgotten an excellent 
<A NAME="645"></A>saying which I have heard from your own lips.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What is it, Nicias?
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> I have often heard you say that "Every man is good 
<A NAME="648"></A>in that in which he is wise, and bad in that in which he is 
<A NAME="649"></A>unwise."
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That is certainly true, Nicias.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> And therefore if the brave man is good, he is also 
<A NAME="652"></A>wise.
<A NAME="653"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do you hear him, Laches?
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Yes, I hear him, but I do not very well understand 
<A NAME="655"></A>him.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I think that I understand him; and he appears to me 
<A NAME="657"></A>to mean that courage is a sort of wisdom.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> What can he possibly mean, Socrates?
<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That is a question which you must ask of 
<A NAME="660"></A>himself.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Tell him then, Nicias, what you mean by this wisdom; 
<A NAME="663"></A>for you surely do not mean the wisdom which plays the 
<A NAME="664"></A>flute?
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Nor the wisdom which plays the lyre?
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> No.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But what is this knowledge then, and of 
<A NAME="669"></A>what?
<A NAME="670"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> I think that you put the question to him very well, 
<A NAME="671"></A>Socrates; and I would like him to say what is the nature of this knowledge 
<A NAME="672"></A>or wisdom.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> I mean to say, Laches, that courage is the knowledge 
<A NAME="674"></A>of that which inspires fear or confidence in war, or in 
<A NAME="675"></A>anything.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> How strangely he is talking, Socrates.
<A NAME="677"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why do you say so, Laches?
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Why, surely courage is one thing, and wisdom 
<A NAME="679"></A>another.
<A NAME="680"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That is just what Nicias denies.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Yes, that is what he denies; but he is 
<A NAME="682"></A>so.
<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Suppose that we instruct instead of abusing 
<A NAME="684"></A>him?
<A NAME="685"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> Laches does not want to instruct me, Socrates; but 
<A NAME="686"></A>having been proved to be talking nonsense himself, he wants to prove that 
<A NAME="687"></A>I have been doing the same.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Very true, Nicias; and you are talking nonsense, as 
<A NAME="689"></A>I shall endeavour to show. Let me ask you a question: Do not physicians 
<A NAME="690"></A>know the dangers of disease? or do the courageous know them? or are the 
<A NAME="691"></A>physicians the same as the courageous?
<A NAME="692"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> Not at all.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> No more than the husbandmen who know the dangers of 
<A NAME="694"></A>husbandry, or than other craftsmen, who have a knowledge of that which 
<A NAME="695"></A>inspires them with fear or confidence in their own arts, and yet they are 
<A NAME="696"></A>not courageous a whit the more for that.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What is Laches saying, Nicias? He appears to be saying 
<A NAME="698"></A>something of importance.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> Yes, he is saying something, but it is not 
<A NAME="700"></A>true.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> How so?
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> Why, because he does not see that the physician's knowledge 
<A NAME="703"></A>only extends to the nature of health and disease: he can tell the sick 
<A NAME="704"></A>man no more than this. Do you imagine, Laches, that the physician knows 
<A NAME="705"></A>whether health or disease is the more terrible to a man? Had not many a 
<A NAME="706"></A>man better never get up from a sick bed? I should like to know whether 
<A NAME="707"></A>you think that life is always better than death. May not death often be 
<A NAME="708"></A>the better of the two?
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Yes certainly so in my opinion.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> And do you think that the same things are terrible 
<A NAME="711"></A>to those who had better die, and to those who had better 
<A NAME="712"></A>live?
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> And do you suppose that the physician or any other 
<A NAME="715"></A>artist knows this, or any one indeed, except he who is skilled in the grounds 
<A NAME="716"></A>of fear and hope? And him I call the courageous.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do you understand his meaning, Laches?
<A NAME="718"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Yes; I suppose that, in his way of speaking, the soothsayers 
<A NAME="719"></A>are courageous. For who but one of them can know to whom to die or to live 
<A NAME="720"></A>is better? And yet Nicias, would you allow that you are yourself a soothsayer, 
<A NAME="721"></A>or are you neither a soothsayer nor courageous?
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> What! do you mean to say that the soothsayer ought 
<A NAME="723"></A>to know the grounds of hope or fear?
<A NAME="724"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Indeed I do: who but he?
<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> Much rather I should say he of whom I speak; for the 
<A NAME="726"></A>soothsayer ought to know only the signs of things that are about to come 
<A NAME="727"></A>to pass, whether death or disease, or loss of property, or victory, or 
<A NAME="728"></A>defeat in war, or in any sort of contest; but to whom the suffering or 
<A NAME="729"></A>not suffering of these things will be for the best, can no more be decided 
<A NAME="730"></A>by the soothsayer than by one who is no soothsayer.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> I cannot understand what Nicias would be at, Socrates; 
<A NAME="732"></A>for he represents the courageous man as neither a soothsayer, nor a physician, 
<A NAME="733"></A>nor in any other character, unless he means to say that he is a god. My 
<A NAME="734"></A>opinion is that he does not like honestly to confess that he is talking 
<A NAME="735"></A>nonsense, but that he shuffles up and down in order to conceal the difficulty 
<A NAME="736"></A>into which he has got himself. You and I, Socrates, might have practised 
<A NAME="737"></A>a similar shuffle just now, if we had only wanted to avoid the appearance 
<A NAME="738"></A>of inconsistency. And if we had been arguing in a court of law there might 
<A NAME="739"></A>have been reason in so doing; but why should a man deck himself out with 
<A NAME="740"></A>vain words at a meeting of friends such as this?
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I quite agree with you, Laches, that he should not. 
<A NAME="742"></A>But perhaps Nicias is serious, and not merely talking for the sake of talking. 
<A NAME="743"></A>Let us ask him just to explain what he means, and if he has reason on his 
<A NAME="744"></A>side we will agree with him; if not, we will instruct 
<A NAME="745"></A>him.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Do you, Socrates, if you like, ask him: I think that 
<A NAME="747"></A>I have asked enough.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I do not see why I should not; and my question will 
<A NAME="749"></A>do for both of us.
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then tell me, Nicias, or rather tell us, for Laches 
<A NAME="752"></A>and I are partners in the argument: Do you mean to affirm that courage 
<A NAME="753"></A>is the knowledge of the grounds of hope and fear?
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> I do.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And not every man has this knowledge; the physician 
<A NAME="756"></A>and the soothsayer have it not; and they will not be courageous unless 
<A NAME="757"></A>they acquire it-that is what you were saying?
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> I was.
<A NAME="759"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then this is certainly not a thing which every pig 
<A NAME="760"></A>would know, as the proverb says, and therefore he could not be 
<A NAME="761"></A>courageous.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> I think not.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Clearly not, Nicias; not even such a big pig as the 
<A NAME="764"></A>Crommyonian sow would be called by you courageous. And this I say not as 
<A NAME="765"></A>a joke, but because I think that he who assents to your doctrine, that 
<A NAME="766"></A>courage is the knowledge of the grounds of fear and hope, cannot allow 
<A NAME="767"></A>that any wild beast is courageous, unless he admits that a lion, or a leopard, 
<A NAME="768"></A>or perhaps a boar, or any other animal, has such a degree of wisdom that 
<A NAME="769"></A>he knows things which but a few human beings ever know by reason of their 
<A NAME="770"></A>difficulty. He who takes your view of courage must affirm that a lion, 
<A NAME="771"></A>and a stag, and a bull, and a monkey, have equally little pretensions to 
<A NAME="772"></A>courage.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Capital, Socrates; by the gods, that is truly good. 
<A NAME="774"></A>And I hope, Nicias, that you will tell us whether these animals, which 
<A NAME="775"></A>we all admit to be courageous, are really wiser than mankind; or whether 
<A NAME="776"></A>you will have the boldness, in the face of universal opinion, to deny their 
<A NAME="777"></A>courage.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> Why, Laches, I do not call animals or any other things 
<A NAME="779"></A>which have no fear of dangers, because they are ignorant of them, courageous, 
<A NAME="780"></A>but only fearless and senseless. Do you imagine that I should call little 
<A NAME="781"></A>children courageous, which fear no dangers because they know none? There 
<A NAME="782"></A>is a difference, to my way of thinking, between fearlessness and courage. 
<A NAME="783"></A>I am of opinion that thoughtful courage is a quality possessed by very 
<A NAME="784"></A>few, but that rashness and boldness, and fearlessness, which has no forethought, 
<A NAME="785"></A>are very common qualities possessed by many men, many women, many children, 
<A NAME="786"></A>many animals. And you, and men in general, call by the term "courageous" 
<A NAME="787"></A>actions which I call rash;-my courageous actions are wise 
<A NAME="788"></A>actions.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Behold, Socrates, how admirably, as he thinks, he dresses 
<A NAME="790"></A>himself out in words, while seeking to deprive of the honour of courage 
<A NAME="791"></A>those whom all the world acknowledges to be courageous.
<A NAME="792"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> Not so, Laches, but do not be alarmed; for I am quite 
<A NAME="793"></A>willing to say of you and also of Lamachus, and of many other Athenians, 
<A NAME="794"></A>that you are courageous and therefore wise.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> I could answer that; but I would not have you cast in 
<A NAME="796"></A>my teeth that I am a haughty Aexonian.
<A NAME="797"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do not answer him, Laches; I rather fancy that you 
<A NAME="798"></A>are not aware of the source from which his wisdom is derived. He has got 
<A NAME="799"></A>all this from my friend Damon, and Damon is always with Prodicus, who, 
<A NAME="800"></A>of all the Sophists, is considered to be the best puller to pieces of words 
<A NAME="801"></A>of this sort.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Yes, Socrates; and the examination of such niceties 
<A NAME="803"></A>is a much more suitable employment for a Sophist than for a great statesman 
<A NAME="804"></A>whom the city chooses to preside over her.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, my sweet friend, but a great statesman is likely 
<A NAME="806"></A>to have a great intelligence. And I think that the view which is implied 
<A NAME="807"></A>in Nicias' definition of courage is worthy of examination.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Then examine for yourself, Socrates.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That is what I am going to do, my dear friend. Do not, 
<A NAME="810"></A>however, suppose I shall let you out of the partnership; for I shall expect 
<A NAME="811"></A>you to apply your mind, and join with me in the consideration of the 
<A NAME="812"></A>question.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> I will if you think that I ought.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, I do; but I must beg of you, Nicias, to begin 
<A NAME="815"></A>again. You remember that we originally considered courage to be a part 
<A NAME="816"></A>of virtue.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="818"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And you yourself said that it was a part; and there 
<A NAME="819"></A>were many other parts, all of which taken together are called 
<A NAME="820"></A>virtue.
<A NAME="821"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do you agree with me about the parts? For I say that 
<A NAME="823"></A>justice, temperance, and the like, are all of them parts of virtue as well 
<A NAME="824"></A>as courage. Would you not say the same?
<A NAME="825"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well then, so far we are agreed. And now let us proceed 
<A NAME="827"></A>a step, and try to arrive at a similar agreement about the fearful and 
<A NAME="828"></A>the hopeful: I do not want you to be thinking one thing and myself another. 
<A NAME="829"></A>Let me then tell you my own opinion, and if I am wrong you shall set me 
<A NAME="830"></A>in my opinion the terrible and the are the things which do or do not create 
<A NAME="831"></A>fear, and fear is not of the present, nor of the past, but is of future 
<A NAME="832"></A>and expected evil. Do you not agree to that, Laches?
<A NAME="833"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Yes, Socrates, entirely.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That is my view, Nicias; the terrible things, as I 
<A NAME="835"></A>should say, are the evils which are future; and the hopeful are the good 
<A NAME="836"></A>or not evil things which are future. Do you or do you not agree with 
<A NAME="837"></A>me?
<A NAME="838"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> I agree.
<A NAME="839"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the knowledge of these things you call 
<A NAME="840"></A>courage?
<A NAME="841"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> Precisely.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And now let me see whether you agree with Laches and 
<A NAME="843"></A>myself as to a third point.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> What is that?
<A NAME="845"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I will tell you. He and I have a notion that there 
<A NAME="846"></A>is not one knowledge or science of the past, another of the present, a 
<A NAME="847"></A>third of what is likely to be best and what will be best in the future; 
<A NAME="848"></A>but that of all three there is one science only: for example, there is 
<A NAME="849"></A>one science of medicine which is concerned with the inspection of health 
<A NAME="850"></A>equally in all times, present, past, and future; and one science of husbandry 
<A NAME="851"></A>in like manner, which is concerned with the productions of the earth in 
<A NAME="852"></A>all times. As to the art of the general, you yourselves will be my witnesses 
<A NAME="853"></A>that he has an excellent foreknowledge of the future, and that he claims 
<A NAME="854"></A>to be the master and not the servant of the soothsayer, because he knows 
<A NAME="855"></A>better what is happening or is likely to happen in war: and accordingly 
<A NAME="856"></A>the law places the soothsayer under the general, and not the general under 
<A NAME="857"></A>the soothsayer. Am I not correct in saying so, Laches?
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> Quite correct.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And do you, Nicias, also acknowledge that the same 
<A NAME="860"></A>science has understanding of the same things, whether future, present, 
<A NAME="861"></A>or past?
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> Yes, indeed Socrates; that is my 
<A NAME="863"></A>opinion.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And courage, my friend, is, as you say, a knowledge 
<A NAME="865"></A>of the fearful and of the hopeful?
<A NAME="866"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the fearful, and the hopeful, are admitted to be 
<A NAME="868"></A>future goods and future evils?
<A NAME="869"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> True.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the same science has to do with the same things 
<A NAME="871"></A>in the future or at any time?
<A NAME="872"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> That is true.
<A NAME="873"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then courage is not the science which is concerned 
<A NAME="874"></A>with the fearful and hopeful, for they are future only; courage, like the 
<A NAME="875"></A>other sciences, is concerned not only with good and evil of the future, 
<A NAME="876"></A>but of the present and past, and of any time?
<A NAME="877"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> That, as I suppose, is true.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then the answer which you have given, Nicias, includes 
<A NAME="879"></A>only a third part of courage; but our question extended to the whole nature 
<A NAME="880"></A>of courage: and according to your view, that is, according to your present 
<A NAME="881"></A>view, courage is not only the knowledge of the hopeful and the fearful, 
<A NAME="882"></A>but seems to include nearly every good and evil without reference to time. 
<A NAME="883"></A>What do you say to that alteration in your statement?
<A NAME="884"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> I agree, Socrates.
<A NAME="885"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But then, my dear friend, if a man knew all good and 
<A NAME="886"></A>evil, and how. they are, and have been, and will be produced, would he 
<A NAME="887"></A>not be perfect, and wanting in no virtue, whether justice, or temperance, 
<A NAME="888"></A>or holiness? He would possess them all, and he would know which were dangers' 
<A NAME="889"></A>and which were not, and guard against them whether they were supernatural 
<A NAME="890"></A>or natural; and he would provide the good, as he would know how to deal 
<A NAME="891"></A>both with gods or men.
<A NAME="892"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> I think, Socrates, that there is a great deal of truth 
<A NAME="893"></A>in what you say.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But then, Nicias, courage, according to this new definition 
<A NAME="895"></A>of yours, instead of being a part of virtue only, will be all 
<A NAME="896"></A>virtue?
<A NAME="897"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> It would seem so.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But we were saying that courage is one of the parts 
<A NAME="899"></A>of virtue?
<A NAME="900"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> Yes, that was what we were saying.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And that is in contradiction with our present 
<A NAME="902"></A>view?
<A NAME="903"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> That appears to be the case.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, Nicias, we have not discovered what courage 
<A NAME="905"></A>is.
<A NAME="906"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> We have not.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> And yet, friend Nicias,l imagined that you would have 
<A NAME="908"></A>made the discovery, when you were so contemptuous of the answers which 
<A NAME="909"></A>I made to Socrates. I had very great hopes that you would have been enlightened 
<A NAME="910"></A>by the wisdom of Damon.
<A NAME="911"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> I perceive, Laches, that you think nothing of having 
<A NAME="912"></A>displayed your ignorance of the nature of courage, but you look only to 
<A NAME="913"></A>see whether I have not made a similar display; and if we are both equally 
<A NAME="914"></A>ignorant of the things which a man who is good for anything should know, 
<A NAME="915"></A>that, I suppose, will be of no consequence. You certainly appear to me 
<A NAME="916"></A>very like the rest of the world, looking at your neighbour and not at yourself. 
<A NAME="917"></A>I am of opinion that enough has been said on the subject which we have 
<A NAME="918"></A>been discussing; and if anything has been imperfectly said, that may be 
<A NAME="919"></A>hereafter corrected by the help of Damon, whom you think to laugh down, 
<A NAME="920"></A>although you have never seen him, and with the help of others. And when 
<A NAME="921"></A>I am satisfied myself, I will freely impart my satisfaction to you, for 
<A NAME="922"></A>I think that you are very much in want of knowledge.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR><B>La.</B> You are a philosopher, Nicias; of that I am aware: nevertheless 
<A NAME="924"></A>I would recommend Lysimachus and Melesias not to take you and me as advisers 
<A NAME="925"></A>about the education of their children; but, as I said at first, they should 
<A NAME="926"></A>ask Socrates and not let him off; if my own sons were old enough, I would 
<A NAME="927"></A>have asked him myself.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR><BR><B>Nic.</B> To that I quite agree, if Socrates is willing to take 
<A NAME="929"></A>them under his charge. I should not wish for any one else to be the tutor 
<A NAME="930"></A>of Niceratus. But I observe that when I mention the matter to him he recommends 
<A NAME="931"></A>to me some other tutor and refuses himself. Perhaps he may be more ready 
<A NAME="932"></A>to listen to you, Lysimachus.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR><BR><B>Lys.</B> He ought, Nicias: for certainly I would do things for 
<A NAME="934"></A>him which I would not do for many others. What do you say, Socrates-will 
<A NAME="935"></A>you comply? And are you ready to give assistance in the improvement of 
<A NAME="936"></A>the youths?
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Indeed, Lysimachus, I should be very wrong in refusing 
<A NAME="938"></A>to aid in the improvement of anybody. And if I had shown in this conversation 
<A NAME="939"></A>that I had a knowledge which Nicias and Laches have not, then I admit that 
<A NAME="940"></A>you would be right in inviting me to perform this duty; but as we are all 
<A NAME="941"></A>in the same perplexity, why should one of us be preferred to another? I 
<A NAME="942"></A>certainly think that no one should; and under these circumstances, let 
<A NAME="943"></A>me offer you a piece of advice (and this need not go further than ourselves). 
<A NAME="944"></A>I maintain, my friends, that every one of us should seek out the best teacher 
<A NAME="945"></A>whom he can find, first for ourselves, who are greatly in need of one, 
<A NAME="946"></A>and then for the youth, regardless of expense or anything. But I cannot 
<A NAME="947"></A>advise that we remain as we are. And if any one laughs at us for going 
<A NAME="948"></A>to school at our age, I would quote to them the authority of Homer, who 
<A NAME="949"></A>says, that
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><BR>Modesty is not good for a needy man. Let us, then, regardless of 
<A NAME="951"></A>what may be said of us, make the education of the youths our own 
<A NAME="952"></A>education.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR><BR><B>Lys.</B> I like your proposal, Socrates; and as I am the oldest, 
<A NAME="954"></A>I am also the most eager to go to school with the boys. Let me beg a favour 
<A NAME="955"></A>of you: Come to my house to-morrow at dawn, and we will advise about these 
<A NAME="956"></A>matters. For the present, let us make an end of the 
<A NAME="957"></A>conversation.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I will come to you to-morrow, Lysimachus, as you propose, 
<A NAME="959"></A>God willing.
