<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Athenian Stranger. Listen, all ye who have just now heard the laws about 
<A NAME="11"></A>Gods, and about our dear forefathers:-Of all the things which a man has, 
<A NAME="12"></A>next to the Gods, his soul is the most divine and most truly his own. Now 
<A NAME="13"></A>in every man there are two parts: the better and superior, which rules, 
<A NAME="14"></A>and the worse and inferior, which serves; and the ruling part of him is 
<A NAME="15"></A>always to be preferred to the subject. Wherefore I am right in bidding 
<A NAME="16"></A>every one next to the Gods, who are our masters, and those who in order 
<A NAME="17"></A>follow them [i.e., the demons], to honour his own soul, which every one 
<A NAME="18"></A>seems to honour, but no one honours as he ought; for honour is a divine 
<A NAME="19"></A>good, and no evil thing is honourable; and he who thinks that he can honour 
<A NAME="20"></A>the soul by word or gift, or any sort of compliance, without making her 
<A NAME="21"></A>in any way better, seems to honour her, but honours her not at all. For 
<A NAME="22"></A>example, every man, from his very boyhood, fancies that he is able to know 
<A NAME="23"></A>everything, and thinks that he honours his soul by praising her, and he 
<A NAME="24"></A>is very ready to let her do whatever she may like. But I mean to say that 
<A NAME="25"></A>in acting thus he injures his soul, and is far from honouring her; whereas, 
<A NAME="26"></A>in our opinion, he ought to honour her as second only to the Gods. Again, 
<A NAME="27"></A>when a man thinks that others are to be blamed, and not himself, for the 
<A NAME="28"></A>errors which he has committed from time to time, and the many and great 
<A NAME="29"></A>evils which befell him in consequence, and is always fancying himself to 
<A NAME="30"></A>be exempt and innocent, he is under the idea that he is honouring his soul; 
<A NAME="31"></A>whereas the very reverse is the fact, for he is really injuring her. And 
<A NAME="32"></A>when, disregarding the word and approval of the legislator, he indulges 
<A NAME="33"></A>in pleasure, then again he is far from honouring her; he only dishonours 
<A NAME="34"></A>her, and fills her full of evil and remorse; or when he does not endure 
<A NAME="35"></A>to the end the labours and fears and sorrows and pains which the legislator 
<A NAME="36"></A>approves, but gives way before them, then, by yielding, he does not honour 
<A NAME="37"></A>the soul, but by all such conduct he makes her to be dishonourable; nor 
<A NAME="38"></A>when he thinks that life at any price is a good, does he honour her, but 
<A NAME="39"></A>yet once more he dishonours her; for the soul having a notion that the 
<A NAME="40"></A>world below is all evil, he yields to her, and does not resist and teach 
<A NAME="41"></A>or convince her that, for aught she knows, the world of the Gods below, 
<A NAME="42"></A>instead of being evil, may be the greatest of all goods. Again, when any 
<A NAME="43"></A>one prefers beauty to virtue, what is this but the real and utter dishonour 
<A NAME="44"></A>of the soul? For such a preference implies that the body is more honourable 
<A NAME="45"></A>than the soul; and this is false, for there is nothing of earthly birth 
<A NAME="46"></A>which is more honourable than the heavenly, and he who thinks otherwise 
<A NAME="47"></A>of the soul has no idea how greatly he undervalues this wonderful possession; 
<A NAME="48"></A>nor, again, when a person is willing, or not unwilling, to acquire dishonest 
<A NAME="49"></A>gains, does he then honour his soul with gifts-far otherwise; he sells 
<A NAME="50"></A>her glory and honour for a small piece of gold; but all the gold which 
<A NAME="51"></A>is under or upon the earth is not enough to give in exchange for virtue. 
<A NAME="52"></A>In a word, I may say that he who does not estimate the base and evil, the 
<A NAME="53"></A>good and noble, according to the standard of the legislator, and abstain 
<A NAME="54"></A>in every possible way from the one and practise the other to the utmost 
<A NAME="55"></A>of his power, does not know that in all these respects he is most foully 
<A NAME="56"></A>and disgracefully abusing his soul, which is the divinest part of man; 
<A NAME="57"></A>for no one, as I may say, ever considers that which is declared to be the 
<A NAME="58"></A>greatest penalty of evil-doing--namely, to grow into the likeness of bad 
<A NAME="59"></A>men, and growing like them to fly from the conversation of the good, and 
<A NAME="60"></A>be cut off from them, and cleave to and follow after the company of the 
<A NAME="61"></A>bad. And he who is joined to them must do and suffer what such men by nature 
<A NAME="62"></A>do and say to one another-a suffering which is not justice but retribution; 
<A NAME="63"></A>for justice and the just are noble, whereas retribution is the suffering 
<A NAME="64"></A>which waits upon injustice; and whether a man escape or endure this, he 
<A NAME="65"></A>is miserable-in the former case, because he is not cured; while in the 
<A NAME="66"></A>latter, he perishes in order that the rest of mankind may be 
<A NAME="67"></A>saved.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>Speaking generally, our glory is to follow the better and improve 
<A NAME="69"></A>the inferior, which is susceptible of improvement, as far as this is possible. 
<A NAME="70"></A>And of all human possessions, the soul is by nature most inclined to avoid 
<A NAME="71"></A>the evil, and track out and find the chief good; which when a man has found, 
<A NAME="72"></A>he should take up his abode with it during the remainder of his life. Wherefore 
<A NAME="73"></A>the soul also is second [or next to God] in honour; and third, as every 
<A NAME="74"></A>one will perceive, comes the honour of the body in natural order. Having 
<A NAME="75"></A>determined this, we have next to consider that there is a natural honour 
<A NAME="76"></A>of the body, and that of honours some are true and some are counterfeit. 
<A NAME="77"></A>To decide which are which is the business of the legislator; and he, I 
<A NAME="78"></A>suspect, would intimate that they are as follows:-Honour is not to be given 
<A NAME="79"></A>to the fair body, or to the strong or the swift or the tall, or to the 
<A NAME="80"></A>healthy body (although many may think otherwise), any more than to their 
<A NAME="81"></A>opposites; but the mean states of all these habits are by far the safest 
<A NAME="82"></A>and most moderate; for the one extreme makes the soul braggart and insolent, 
<A NAME="83"></A>and the other, illiberal and base; and money, and property, and distinction 
<A NAME="84"></A>all go to the same tune. The excess of any of these things is apt to be 
<A NAME="85"></A>a source of hatreds and divisions among states and individuals; and the 
<A NAME="86"></A>defect of them is commonly a cause of slavery. And, therefore, I would 
<A NAME="87"></A>not have any one fond of heaping up riches for the sake of his children, 
<A NAME="88"></A>in order that he may leave them as rich as possible. For the possession 
<A NAME="89"></A>of great wealth is of no use, either to them or to the state. The condition 
<A NAME="90"></A>of youth which is free from flattery, and at the same time not in need 
<A NAME="91"></A>of the necessaries of life, is the best and most harmonious of all, being 
<A NAME="92"></A>in accord and agreement with our nature, and making life to be most entirely 
<A NAME="93"></A>free from sorrow. Let parents, then, bequeath to their children not a heap 
<A NAME="94"></A>of riches, but the spirit of reverence. We, indeed, fancy that they will 
<A NAME="95"></A>inherit reverence from us, if we rebuke them when they show a want of reverence. 
<A NAME="96"></A>But this quality is not really imparted to them by the present style of 
<A NAME="97"></A>admonition, which only tells them that the young ought always to be reverential. 
<A NAME="98"></A>A sensible legislator will rather exhort the elders to reverence the younger, 
<A NAME="99"></A>and above all to take heed that no young man sees or hears one of themselves 
<A NAME="100"></A>doing or saying anything disgraceful; for where old men have no shame, 
<A NAME="101"></A>there young men will most certainly be devoid of reverence. The best way 
<A NAME="102"></A>of training the young is to train yourself at the same time; not to admonish 
<A NAME="103"></A>them, but to be always carrying out your own admonitions in practice. He 
<A NAME="104"></A>who honours his kindred, and reveres those who share in the same Gods and 
<A NAME="105"></A>are of the same blood and family, may fairly expect that the Gods who preside 
<A NAME="106"></A>over generation will be propitious to him, and will quicken his seed. And 
<A NAME="107"></A>he who deems the services which his friends and acquaintances do for him, 
<A NAME="108"></A>greater and more important than they themselves deem them, and his own 
<A NAME="109"></A>favours to them less than theirs to him, will have their good-will in the 
<A NAME="110"></A>intercourse of life. And surely in his relations to the state and his fellow 
<A NAME="111"></A>citizens, he is by far the best, who rather than the Olympic or any other 
<A NAME="112"></A>victory of peace or war, desires to win the palm of obedience to the laws 
<A NAME="113"></A>of his country, and who, of all mankind, is the person reputed to have 
<A NAME="114"></A>obeyed them best through life. In his relations to strangers, a man should 
<A NAME="115"></A>consider that a contract is a most holy thing, and that all concerns and 
<A NAME="116"></A>wrongs of strangers are more directly dependent on the protection of God, 
<A NAME="117"></A>than wrongs done to citizens; for the stranger, having no kindred and friends, 
<A NAME="118"></A>is more to be pitied by Gods and men. Wherefore, also, he who is most able 
<A NAME="119"></A>to avenge him is most zealous in his cause; and he who is most able is 
<A NAME="120"></A>the genius and the god of the stranger, who follow in the train of Zeus, 
<A NAME="121"></A>the god of strangers. And for this reason, he who has a spark of caution 
<A NAME="122"></A>in him, will do his best to pass through life without sinning against the 
<A NAME="123"></A>stranger. And of offences committed, whether against strangers or fellow-countrymen, 
<A NAME="124"></A>that against suppliants is the greatest. For the god who witnessed to the 
<A NAME="125"></A>agreement made with the suppliant, becomes in a special manner the guardian 
<A NAME="126"></A>of the sufferer; and he will certainly not suffer unavenged.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>Thus we have fairly described the manner in which a man is to act 
<A NAME="128"></A>about his parents, and himself, and his own affairs; and in relation to 
<A NAME="129"></A>the state, and his friends, and kindred, both in what concerns his own 
<A NAME="130"></A>countrymen, and in what concerns the stranger. We will now consider what 
<A NAME="131"></A>manner of man he must be who would best pass through life in respect of 
<A NAME="132"></A>those other things which are not matters of law, but of praise and blame 
<A NAME="133"></A>only; in which praise and blame educate a man, and make him more tractable 
<A NAME="134"></A>and amenable to the laws which are about to be imposed.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>Truth is the beginning of every good thing, both to Gods and men; 
<A NAME="136"></A>and he who would be blessed and happy, should be from the first a partaker 
<A NAME="137"></A>of the truth, that he may live a true man as long as possible, for then 
<A NAME="138"></A>he can be trusted; but he is not to be trusted who loves voluntary falsehood, 
<A NAME="139"></A>and he who loves involuntary falsehood is a fool. Neither condition is 
<A NAME="140"></A>enviable, for the untrustworthy and ignorant has no friend, and as time 
<A NAME="141"></A>advances he becomes known, and lays up in store for himself isolation in 
<A NAME="142"></A>crabbed age when life is on the wane: so that, whether his children or 
<A NAME="143"></A>friends are alive or not, he is equally solitary.-Worthy of honour is he 
<A NAME="144"></A>who does no injustice, and of more than twofold honour, if he not only 
<A NAME="145"></A>does no injustice himself, but hinders others from doing any; the first 
<A NAME="146"></A>may count as one man, the second is worth many men, because he informs 
<A NAME="147"></A>the rulers of the injustice of others. And yet more highly to be esteemed 
<A NAME="148"></A>is he who co-operates with the rulers in correcting the citizens as far 
<A NAME="149"></A>as he can-he shall be proclaimed the great and perfect citizen, and bear 
<A NAME="150"></A>away the palm of virtue. The same praise may be given about temperance 
<A NAME="151"></A>and wisdom, and all other goods which may be imparted to others, as well 
<A NAME="152"></A>as acquired by a man for himself; he who imparts them shall be honoured 
<A NAME="153"></A>as the man of men, and he who is willing, yet is not able, may be allowed 
<A NAME="154"></A>the second place; but he who is jealous and will not, if he can help, allow 
<A NAME="155"></A>others to partake in a friendly way of any good, is deserving of blame: 
<A NAME="156"></A>the good, however, which he has, is not to be undervalued by us because 
<A NAME="157"></A>it is possessed by him, but must be acquired by us also to the utmost of 
<A NAME="158"></A>our power. Let every man, then, freely strive for the prize of virtue, 
<A NAME="159"></A>and let there be no envy. For the unenvious nature increases the greatness 
<A NAME="160"></A>of states-he himself contends in the race, blasting the fair fame of no 
<A NAME="161"></A>man; but the envious, who thinks that he ought to get the better by defaming 
<A NAME="162"></A>others, is less energetic himself in the pursuit of true virtue, and reduces 
<A NAME="163"></A>his rivals to despair by his unjust slanders of them. And so he makes the 
<A NAME="164"></A>whole city to enter the arena untrained in the practice of virtue, and 
<A NAME="165"></A>diminishes her glory as far as in him lies. Now every man should be valiant, 
<A NAME="166"></A>but he should also be gentle. From the cruel, or hardly curable, or altogether 
<A NAME="167"></A>incurable acts of injustice done to him by others, a man can only escape 
<A NAME="168"></A>by fighting and defending himself and conquering, and by never ceasing 
<A NAME="169"></A>to punish them; and no man who is not of a noble spirit is able to accomplish 
<A NAME="170"></A>this. As to the actions of those who do evil, but whose evil is curable, 
<A NAME="171"></A>in the first place, let us remember that the unjust man is not unjust of 
<A NAME="172"></A>his own free will. For no man of his own free will would choose to possess 
<A NAME="173"></A>the greatest of evils, and least of all in the most honourable part of 
<A NAME="174"></A>himself. And the soul, as we said, is of a truth deemed by all men the 
<A NAME="175"></A>most honourable. In the soul, then, which is the most honourable part of 
<A NAME="176"></A>him, no one, if he could help, would admit, or allow to continue the greatest 
<A NAME="177"></A>of evils. The unrighteous and vicious are always to be pitied in any case; 
<A NAME="178"></A>and one can afford to forgive as well as pity him who is curable, and refrain 
<A NAME="179"></A>and calm one's anger, not getting into a passion, like a woman, and nursing 
<A NAME="180"></A>ill-feeling. But upon him who is incapable of reformation and wholly evil, 
<A NAME="181"></A>the vials of our wrath should be poured out; wherefore I say that good 
<A NAME="182"></A>men ought, when occasion demands, to be both gentle and 
<A NAME="183"></A>passionate.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>Of all evils the greatest is one which in the souls of most men 
<A NAME="185"></A>is innate, and which a man is always excusing in himself and never correcting; 
<A NAME="186"></A>mean, what is expressed in the saying that "Every man by nature is and 
<A NAME="187"></A>ought to be his own friend." Whereas the excessive love of self is in reality 
<A NAME="188"></A>the source to each man of all offences; for the lover is blinded about 
<A NAME="189"></A>the beloved, so that he judges wrongly of the just, the good, and the honourable, 
<A NAME="190"></A>and thinks that he ought always to prefer himself to the truth. But he 
<A NAME="191"></A>who would be a great man ought to regard, not himself or his interests, 
<A NAME="192"></A>but what is just, whether the just act be his own or that of another. Through 
<A NAME="193"></A>a similar error men are induced to fancy that their own ignorance is wisdom, 
<A NAME="194"></A>and thus we who may be truly said to know nothing, think that we know all 
<A NAME="195"></A>things; and because we will not let others act for us in what we do not 
<A NAME="196"></A>know, we are compelled to act amiss ourselves. Wherefore let every man 
<A NAME="197"></A>avoid excess of self-love, and condescend to follow a better man than himself, 
<A NAME="198"></A>not allowing any false shame to stand in the way. There are also minor 
<A NAME="199"></A>precepts which are often repeated, and are quite as useful; a man should 
<A NAME="200"></A>recollect them and remind himself of them. For when a stream is flowing 
<A NAME="201"></A>out, there should be water flowing in too; and recollection flows in while 
<A NAME="202"></A>wisdom is departing. Therefore I say that a man should refrain from excess 
<A NAME="203"></A>either of laughter or tears, and should exhort his neighbour to do the 
<A NAME="204"></A>same; he should veil his immoderate sorrow or joy, and seek to behave with 
<A NAME="205"></A>propriety, whether the genius of his good fortune remains with him, or 
<A NAME="206"></A>whether at the crisis of his fate, when he seems to be mounting high and 
<A NAME="207"></A>steep places, the Gods oppose him in some of his enterprises. Still he 
<A NAME="208"></A>may ever hope, in the case of good men, that whatever afflictions are to 
<A NAME="209"></A>befall them in the future God will lessen, and that present evils he will 
<A NAME="210"></A>change for the better; and as to the goods which are the opposite of these 
<A NAME="211"></A>evils, he will not doubt that they will be added to them, and that they 
<A NAME="212"></A>will be fortunate. Such should be men's hopes, and such should be the exhortations 
<A NAME="213"></A>with which they admonish one another, never losing an opportunity, but 
<A NAME="214"></A>on every occasion distinctly reminding themselves and others of all these 
<A NAME="215"></A>things, both in jest and earnest.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>Enough has now been said of divine matters, both as touching the 
<A NAME="217"></A>practices which men ought to follow, and as to the sort of persons who 
<A NAME="218"></A>they ought severally to be. But of human things we have not as yet spoken, 
<A NAME="219"></A>and we must; for to men we are discoursing and not to Gods. Pleasures and 
<A NAME="220"></A>pains and desires are a part of human nature, and on them every mortal 
<A NAME="221"></A>being must of necessity hang and depend with the most eager interest. And 
<A NAME="222"></A>therefore we must praise the noblest life, not only as the fairest in appearance, 
<A NAME="223"></A>but as being one which, if a man will only taste, and not, while still 
<A NAME="224"></A>in his youth, desert for another, he will find to surpass also in the very 
<A NAME="225"></A>thing which we all of us desire-I mean in having a greater amount of pleasure 
<A NAME="226"></A>and less of pain during the whole of life. And this will be plain, if a 
<A NAME="227"></A>man has a true taste of them, as will be quickly and clearly seen. But 
<A NAME="228"></A>what is a true taste? That we have to learn from the argument-the point 
<A NAME="229"></A>being what is according to nature, and what is not according to nature. 
<A NAME="230"></A>One life must be compared with another, the more pleasurable with the more 
<A NAME="231"></A>painful, after this manner:-We desire to have pleasure, but we neither 
<A NAME="232"></A>desire nor choose pain; and the neutral state we are ready to take in exchange, 
<A NAME="233"></A>not for pleasure but for pain; and we also wish for less pain and greater 
<A NAME="234"></A>pleasure, but less pleasure and greater pain we do not wish for; and an 
<A NAME="235"></A>equal balance of either we cannot venture to assert that we should desire. 
<A NAME="236"></A>And all these differ or do not differ severally in number and magnitude 
<A NAME="237"></A>and intensity and equality, and in the opposites of these when regarded 
<A NAME="238"></A>as objects of choice, in relation to desire. And such being the necessary 
<A NAME="239"></A>order of things, we wish for that life in which there are many great and 
<A NAME="240"></A>intense elements of pleasure and pain, and in which the pleasures are in 
<A NAME="241"></A>excess, and do not wish for that in which the opposites exceed; nor, again, 
<A NAME="242"></A>do we wish for that in which the clements of either are small and few and 
<A NAME="243"></A>feeble, and the pains exceed. And when, as I said before, there is a balance 
<A NAME="244"></A>of pleasure and pain in life, this is to be regarded by us as the balanced 
<A NAME="245"></A>life; while other lives are preferred by us because they exceed in what 
<A NAME="246"></A>we like, or are rejected by us because they exceed in what we dislike. 
<A NAME="247"></A>All the lives of men may be regarded by us as bound up in these, and we 
<A NAME="248"></A>must also consider what sort of lives we by nature desire. And if we wish 
<A NAME="249"></A>for any others, I say that we desire them only through some ignorance and 
<A NAME="250"></A>inexperience of the lives which actually exist.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>Now, what lives are they, and how many in which, having searched 
<A NAME="252"></A>out and beheld the objects of will and desire and their opposites, and 
<A NAME="253"></A>making of them a law, choosing, I say, the dear and the pleasant and the 
<A NAME="254"></A>best and noblest, a man may live in the happiest way possible? Let us say 
<A NAME="255"></A>that the temperate life is one kind of life, and the rational another, 
<A NAME="256"></A>and the courageous another, and the healthful another; and to these four 
<A NAME="257"></A>let us oppose four other lives-the foolish, the cowardly, the intemperate, 
<A NAME="258"></A>the diseased. He who knows the temperate life will describe it as in all 
<A NAME="259"></A>things gentle, having gentle pains and gentle pleasures, and placid desires 
<A NAME="260"></A>and loves not insane; whereas the intemperate life is impetuous in all 
<A NAME="261"></A>things, and has violent pains and pleasures, and vehement and stinging 
<A NAME="262"></A>desires, and loves utterly insane; and in the temperate life the pleasures 
<A NAME="263"></A>exceed the pains, but in the intemperate life the pains exceed the pleasures 
<A NAME="264"></A>in greatness and number and frequency. Hence one of the two lives is naturally 
<A NAME="265"></A>and necessarily more pleasant and the other more painful, and he who would 
<A NAME="266"></A>live pleasantly cannot possibly choose to live intemperately. And if this 
<A NAME="267"></A>is true, the inference clearly is that no man is voluntarily intemperate; 
<A NAME="268"></A>but that the whole multitude of men lack temperance in their lives, either 
<A NAME="269"></A>from ignorance, or from want of self-control, or both. And the same holds 
<A NAME="270"></A>of the diseased and healthy life; they both have pleasures and pains, but 
<A NAME="271"></A>in health the pleasure exceeds the pain, and in sickness the pain exceeds 
<A NAME="272"></A>the pleasure. Now our intention in choosing the lives is not that the painful 
<A NAME="273"></A>should exceed, but the life in which pain is exceeded by pleasure we have 
<A NAME="274"></A>determined to be the more pleasant life. And we should say that the temperate 
<A NAME="275"></A>life has the elements both of pleasure and pain fewer and smaller and less 
<A NAME="276"></A>frequent than the intemperate, and the wise life than the foolish life, 
<A NAME="277"></A>and the life of courage than the life of cowardice; one of each pair exceeding 
<A NAME="278"></A>in pleasure and the other in pain, the courageous surpassing the cowardly, 
<A NAME="279"></A>and the wise exceeding the foolish. And so the one dass of lives exceeds 
<A NAME="280"></A>the other class in pleasure; the temperate and courageous and wise and 
<A NAME="281"></A>healthy exceed the cowardly and foolish and intemperate and diseased lives; 
<A NAME="282"></A>and generally speaking, that which has any virtue, whether of body or soul, 
<A NAME="283"></A>is pleasanter than the vicious life, and far superior in beauty and rectitude 
<A NAME="284"></A>and excellence and reputation, and causes him who lives accordingly to 
<A NAME="285"></A>be infinitely happier than the opposite.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>Enough of the preamble; and now the laws should follow; or, to 
<A NAME="287"></A>speak more correctly, outline of them. As, then, in the case of a web or 
<A NAME="288"></A>any other tissue, the warp and the woof cannot be made of the same materials, 
<A NAME="289"></A>but the warp is necessarily superior as being stronger, and having a certain 
<A NAME="290"></A>character of firmness, whereas the woof is softer and has a proper degree 
<A NAME="291"></A>of elasticity;-in a similar manner those who are to hold great offices 
<A NAME="292"></A>in states, should be distinguished truly in each case from those who have 
<A NAME="293"></A>been but slenderly proven by education. Let us suppose that there are two 
<A NAME="294"></A>parts in the constitution of a state-one the creation of offices, the other 
<A NAME="295"></A>the laws which are assigned to them to administer.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>But, before all this, comes the following consideration:-The shepherd 
<A NAME="297"></A>or herdsman, or breeder of horses or the like, when he has received his 
<A NAME="298"></A>animals will not begin to train them until he has first purified them in 
<A NAME="299"></A>a manner which befits a community of animals; he will divide the healthy 
<A NAME="300"></A>and unhealthy, and the good breed and the bad breed, and will send away 
<A NAME="301"></A>the unhealthy and badly bred to other herds, and tend the rest, reflecting 
<A NAME="302"></A>that his labours will be vain and have no effect, either on the souls or 
<A NAME="303"></A>bodies of those whom nature and ill nurture have corrupted, and that they 
<A NAME="304"></A>will involve in destruction the pure and healthy nature and being of every 
<A NAME="305"></A>other animal, if he should neglect to purify them. Now the case of other 
<A NAME="306"></A>animals is not so important-they are only worth introducing for the sake 
<A NAME="307"></A>of illustration; but what relates to man is of the highest importance; 
<A NAME="308"></A>and the legislator should make enquiries, and indicate what is proper for 
<A NAME="309"></A>each one in the way of purification and of any other procedure. Take, for 
<A NAME="310"></A>example, the purification of a city-there are many kinds of purification, 
<A NAME="311"></A>some easier and others more difficult; and some of them, and the best and 
<A NAME="312"></A>most difficult of them, the legislator, if he be also a despot, may be 
<A NAME="313"></A>able to effect; but the legislator, who, not being a despot, sets up a 
<A NAME="314"></A>new government and laws, even if he attempt the mildest of purgations, 
<A NAME="315"></A>may think himself happy if he can complete his work. The best kind of purification 
<A NAME="316"></A>is painful, like similar cures in medicine, involving righteous punishment 
<A NAME="317"></A>and inflicting death or exile in the last resort. For in this way we commonly 
<A NAME="318"></A>dispose of great sinners who are incurable, and are the greatest injury 
<A NAME="319"></A>of the whole state. But the milder form of purification is as follows:-when 
<A NAME="320"></A>men who have nothing, and are in want of food, show a disposition to follow 
<A NAME="321"></A>their leaders in an attack on the property of the rich-these, who are the 
<A NAME="322"></A>natural plague of the state, are sent away by the legislator in a friendly 
<A NAME="323"></A>spirit as far as he is able; and this dismissal of them is euphemistically 
<A NAME="324"></A>termed a colony. And every legislator should contrive to do this at once. 
<A NAME="325"></A>Our present case, however, is peculiar. For there is no need to devise 
<A NAME="326"></A>any colony or purifying separation under the circumstances in which we 
<A NAME="327"></A>are placed. But as, when many streams flow together from many sources, 
<A NAME="328"></A>whether springs or mountain torrents, into a single lake, we ought to attend 
<A NAME="329"></A>and take care that the confluent waters should be perfectly clear, and 
<A NAME="330"></A>in order to effect this, should pump and draw off and divert impurities, 
<A NAME="331"></A>so in every political arrangement there may be trouble and danger. But, 
<A NAME="332"></A>seeing that we are now only discoursing and not acting, let our selection 
<A NAME="333"></A>be supposed to be completed, and the desired purity attained. Touching 
<A NAME="334"></A>evil men, who want to join and be citizens of our state, after we have 
<A NAME="335"></A>tested them by every sort of persuasion and for a sufficient time, we will 
<A NAME="336"></A>prevent them from coming; but the good we will to the utmost of our ability 
<A NAME="337"></A>receive as friends with open arms.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>Another piece of good fortune must not be forgotten, which, as 
<A NAME="339"></A>we were saying, the Heraclid colony had, and which is also ours-that we 
<A NAME="340"></A>have escaped division of land and the abolition of debts; for these are 
<A NAME="341"></A>always a source of dangerous contention, and a city which is driven by 
<A NAME="342"></A>necessity to legislate upon such matters can neither allow the old ways 
<A NAME="343"></A>to continue, nor yet venture to alter them. We must have recourse to prayers, 
<A NAME="344"></A>so to speak, and hope that a slight change may be cautiously effected in 
<A NAME="345"></A>a length of time. And such a change can be accomplished by those who have 
<A NAME="346"></A>abundance of land, and having also many debtors, are willing, in a kindly 
<A NAME="347"></A>spirit, to share with those who are in want, sometimes remitting and sometimes 
<A NAME="348"></A>giving, holding fast in a path of moderation, and deeming poverty to be 
<A NAME="349"></A>the increase of a man's desires and not the diminution of his property. 
<A NAME="350"></A>For this is the great beginning of salvation to a state, and upon this 
<A NAME="351"></A>lasting basis may be erected afterwards whatever political order is suitable 
<A NAME="352"></A>under the circumstances; but if the change be based upon an unsound principle, 
<A NAME="353"></A>the future administration of the country will be full of difficulties. 
<A NAME="354"></A>That is a danger which, as I am saying, is escaped by us, and yet we had 
<A NAME="355"></A>better say how, if we had not escaped, we might have escaped; and we may 
<A NAME="356"></A>venture now to assert that no other way of escape, whether narrow or broad, 
<A NAME="357"></A>can be devised but freedom from avarice and a sense of justice-upon this 
<A NAME="358"></A>rock our city shall be built; for there ought to be no disputes among citizens 
<A NAME="359"></A>about property. If there are quarrels of long standing among them, no legislator 
<A NAME="360"></A>of any degree of sense will proceed a step in the arrangement of the state 
<A NAME="361"></A>until they are settled. But that they to whom God has given, as he has 
<A NAME="362"></A>to us, to be the founders of a new state as yet free from enmity-that they 
<A NAME="363"></A>should create themselves enmities by their mode of distributing lands and 
<A NAME="364"></A>houses, would be superhuman folly and wickedness.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>How then can we rightly order the distribution of the land? In 
<A NAME="366"></A>the first place, the number of the citizens has to be determined, and also 
<A NAME="367"></A>the number and size of the divisions into which they will have to be formed; 
<A NAME="368"></A>and the land and the houses will then have to be apportioned by us as fairly 
<A NAME="369"></A>as we can. The number of citizens can only be estimated satisfactorily 
<A NAME="370"></A>in relation to the territory and the neighbouring states. The territory 
<A NAME="371"></A>must be sufficient to maintain a certain number of inhabitants in a moderate 
<A NAME="372"></A>way of life-more than this is not required; and the number of citizens 
<A NAME="373"></A>should be sufficient to defend themselves against the injustice of their 
<A NAME="374"></A>neighbours, and also to give them the power of rendering efficient aid 
<A NAME="375"></A>to their neighbours when they are wronged. After having taken a survey 
<A NAME="376"></A>of theirs and their neighbours' territory, we will determine the limits 
<A NAME="377"></A>of them in fact as well as in theory. And now, let us proceed to legislate 
<A NAME="378"></A>with a view to perfecting the form and outline of our state. The number 
<A NAME="379"></A>of our citizens shall be 5040-this will be a convenient number; and these 
<A NAME="380"></A>shall be owners of the land and protectors of the allotment. The houses 
<A NAME="381"></A>and the land will be divided in the same way, so that every man may correspond 
<A NAME="382"></A>to a lot. Let the whole number be first divided into two parts, and then 
<A NAME="383"></A>into three; and the number is further capable of being divided into four 
<A NAME="384"></A>or five parts, or any number of parts up to ten. Every legislator ought 
<A NAME="385"></A>to know so much arithmetic as to be able to tell what number is most likely 
<A NAME="386"></A>to be useful to all cities; and we are going to take that number which 
<A NAME="387"></A>contains the greatest and most regular and unbroken series of divisions. 
<A NAME="388"></A>The whole of number has every possible division, and the number 5040 can 
<A NAME="389"></A>be divided by exactly fifty-nine divisors, and ten of these proceed without 
<A NAME="390"></A>interval from one to ten: this will furnish numbers for war and peace, 
<A NAME="391"></A>and for all contracts and dealings, including taxes and divisions of the 
<A NAME="392"></A>land. These properties of number should be ascertained at leisure by those 
<A NAME="393"></A>who are bound by law to know them; for they are true, and should be proclaimed 
<A NAME="394"></A>at the foundation of the city, with a view to use. Whether the legislator 
<A NAME="395"></A>is establishing a new state or restoring an old and decayed one, in respect 
<A NAME="396"></A>of Gods and temples-the temples which are to be built in each city, and 
<A NAME="397"></A>the Gods or demi-gods after whom they are to be called-if he be a man of 
<A NAME="398"></A>sense, he will make no change in anything which the oracle of Delphi, or 
<A NAME="399"></A>Dodona, or the God Ammon, or any ancient tradition has sanctioned in whatever 
<A NAME="400"></A>manner, whether by apparitions or reputed inspiration of Heaven, in obedience 
<A NAME="401"></A>to which mankind have established sacrifices in connection with mystic 
<A NAME="402"></A>rites, either originating on the spot, or derived from Tyrrhenia or Cyprus 
<A NAME="403"></A>or some other place, and on the strength of which traditions they have 
<A NAME="404"></A>consecrated oracles and images, and altars and temples, and portioned out 
<A NAME="405"></A>a sacred domain for each of them. The least part of all these ought not 
<A NAME="406"></A>to be disturbed by the legislator; but he should assign to the several 
<A NAME="407"></A>districts some God, or demi-god, or hero, and, in the distribution of the 
<A NAME="408"></A>soil, should give to these first their chosen domain and all things fitting, 
<A NAME="409"></A>that the inhabitants of the several districts may meet at fixed times, 
<A NAME="410"></A>and that they may readily supply their various wants, and entertain one 
<A NAME="411"></A>another with sacrifices, and become friends and acquaintances; for there 
<A NAME="412"></A>is no greater good in a state than that the citizens should be known to 
<A NAME="413"></A>one another. When not light but darkness and ignorance of each other's 
<A NAME="414"></A>characters prevails among them, no one will receive the honour of which 
<A NAME="415"></A>he is deserving, or the power or the justice to which he is fairly entitled: 
<A NAME="416"></A>wherefore, in every state, above all things, every man should take heed 
<A NAME="417"></A>that he have no deceit in him, but that he be always true and simple; and 
<A NAME="418"></A>that no deceitful person take any advantage of him.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>The next move in our pastime of legislation, like the withdrawal 
<A NAME="420"></A>of the stone from the holy line in the game of draughts, being an unusual 
<A NAME="421"></A>one, will probably excite wonder when mentioned for the first time. And 
<A NAME="422"></A>yet, if a man will only reflect and weigh the matter with care, he will 
<A NAME="423"></A>see that our city is ordered in a manner which, if not the best, is the 
<A NAME="424"></A>second best. Perhaps also some one may not approve this form, because he 
<A NAME="425"></A>thinks that such a constitution is ill adapted to a legislator who has 
<A NAME="426"></A>not despotic power. The truth is, that there are three forms of government, 
<A NAME="427"></A>the best, the second and the third best, which we may just mention, and 
<A NAME="428"></A>then leave the selection to the ruler of the settlement. Following this 
<A NAME="429"></A>method in the present instance, let us speak of the states which are respectively 
<A NAME="430"></A>first, second, and third in excellence, and then we will leave the choice 
<A NAME="431"></A>to Cleinias now, or to any one else who may hereafter have to make a similar 
<A NAME="432"></A>choice among constitutions, and may desire to give to his state some feature 
<A NAME="433"></A>which is congenial to him and which he approves in his own 
<A NAME="434"></A>country.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>The first and highest form of the state and of the government and 
<A NAME="436"></A>of the law is that in which there prevails most widely the ancient saying, 
<A NAME="437"></A>that "Friends have all things in common." Whether there is anywhere now, 
<A NAME="438"></A>or will ever be, this communion of women and children and of property, 
<A NAME="439"></A>in which the private and individual is altogether banished from life, and 
<A NAME="440"></A>things which are by nature private, such as eyes and ears and hands, have 
<A NAME="441"></A>become common, and in some way see and hear and act in common, and all 
<A NAME="442"></A>men express praise and blame and feel joy and sorrow on the same occasions, 
<A NAME="443"></A>and whatever laws there are unite the city to the utmost-whether all this 
<A NAME="444"></A>is possible or not, I say that no man, acting upon any other principle, 
<A NAME="445"></A>will ever constitute a state which will be truer or better or more exalted 
<A NAME="446"></A>in virtue. Whether such a state is governed by Gods or sons of Gods, one, 
<A NAME="447"></A>or more than one, happy are the men who, living after this manner, dwell 
<A NAME="448"></A>there; and therefore to this we are to look for the pattern of the state, 
<A NAME="449"></A>and to cling to this, and to seek with all our might for one which is like 
<A NAME="450"></A>this. The state which we have now in hand, when created, will be nearest 
<A NAME="451"></A>to immortality and the only one which takes the second place; and after 
<A NAME="452"></A>that, by the grace of God, we will complete the third one. And we will 
<A NAME="453"></A>begin by speaking of the nature and origin of the second.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>Let the citizens at once distribute their land and houses, and 
<A NAME="455"></A>not till the land in common, since a community of goods goes beyond their 
<A NAME="456"></A>proposed origin, and nurture, and education. But in making the distribution, 
<A NAME="457"></A>let the several possessors feel that their particular lots also belong 
<A NAME="458"></A>to the whole city; and seeing that the earth is their parent, let them 
<A NAME="459"></A>tend her more carefully than children do their mother. For she is a goddess 
<A NAME="460"></A>and their queen, and they are her mortal subjects. Such also are the feelings 
<A NAME="461"></A>which they ought to entertain to the Gods and demi-gods of the country. 
<A NAME="462"></A>And in order that the distribution may always remain, they ought to consider 
<A NAME="463"></A>further that the present number of families should be always retained, 
<A NAME="464"></A>and neither increased nor diminished. This may be secured for the whole 
<A NAME="465"></A>city in the following manner:-Let the possessor of a lot leave the one 
<A NAME="466"></A>of his children who is his best beloved, and one only, to be the heir of 
<A NAME="467"></A>his dwelling, and his successor in the duty of ministering to the Gods, 
<A NAME="468"></A>the state and the family, as well the living members of it as those who 
<A NAME="469"></A>are departed when he comes into the inheritance; but of his other children, 
<A NAME="470"></A>if he have more than one, he shall give the females in marriage according 
<A NAME="471"></A>to the law to be hereafter enacted, and the males he shall distribute as 
<A NAME="472"></A>sons to those citizens who have no children and are disposed to receive 
<A NAME="473"></A>them; or if there should be none such, and particular individuals have 
<A NAME="474"></A>too many children, male or female, or too few, as in the case of barrenness-in 
<A NAME="475"></A>all these cases let the highest and most honourable magistracy created 
<A NAME="476"></A>by us judge and determine what is to be done with the redundant or deficient, 
<A NAME="477"></A>and devise a means that the number of 5040 houses shall always remain the 
<A NAME="478"></A>same. There are many ways of regulating numbers; for they in whom generation 
<A NAME="479"></A>is affluent may be made to refrain, and, on the other hand, special care 
<A NAME="480"></A>may be taken to increase the number of births by rewards and stigmas, or 
<A NAME="481"></A>we may meet the evil by the elder men giving advice and administering rebuke 
<A NAME="482"></A>to the younger-in this way the object may be attained. And if after all 
<A NAME="483"></A>there be very great difficulty about the equal preservation of the 5040 
<A NAME="484"></A>houses, and there be an excess of citizens, owing to the too great love 
<A NAME="485"></A>of those who live together, and we are at our wits' end, there is still 
<A NAME="486"></A>the old device often mentioned by us of sending out a colony, which will 
<A NAME="487"></A>part friends with us, and be composed of suitable persons. If, on the other 
<A NAME="488"></A>hand, there come a wave bearing a deluge of disease, or a plague of war, 
<A NAME="489"></A>and the inhabitants become much fewer than the appointed number by reason 
<A NAME="490"></A>of bereavement, we ought not to introduce citizens of spurious birth and 
<A NAME="491"></A>education, if this can be avoided; but even God is said not to be able 
<A NAME="492"></A>to fight against necessity.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR>Wherefore let us suppose this "high argument" of ours to address 
<A NAME="494"></A>us in the following terms:-Best of men, cease not to honour according to 
<A NAME="495"></A>nature similarity and equality and sameness and agreement, as regards number 
<A NAME="496"></A>and every good and noble quality. And, above all, observe the aforesaid 
<A NAME="497"></A>number 5040 throughout life; in the second place, do not disparage the 
<A NAME="498"></A>small and modest proportions of the inheritances which you received in 
<A NAME="499"></A>the distribution, by buying and selling them to one another. For then neither 
<A NAME="500"></A>will the God who gave you the lot be your friend, nor will the legislator; 
<A NAME="501"></A>and indeed the law declares to the disobedient that these are the terms 
<A NAME="502"></A>upon which he may or may not take the lot. In the first place, the earth 
<A NAME="503"></A>as he is informed is sacred to the Gods; and in the next place, priests 
<A NAME="504"></A>and priestesses will offer up prayers over a first, and second, and even 
<A NAME="505"></A>a third sacrifice, that he who buys or sells the houses or lands which 
<A NAME="506"></A>he has received, may suffer the punishment which he deserves; and these 
<A NAME="507"></A>their prayers they shall write down in the temples, on tablets of cypress-wood, 
<A NAME="508"></A>for the instruction of posterity. Moreover they will set a watch over all 
<A NAME="509"></A>these things, that they may be observed;-the magistracy which has the sharpest 
<A NAME="510"></A>eyes shall keep watch that any infringement of these commands may be discovered 
<A NAME="511"></A>and punished as offences both against the law and the God. How great is 
<A NAME="512"></A>the benefit of such an ordinance to all those cities, which obey and are 
<A NAME="513"></A>administered accordingly, no bad man can ever know, as the old proverb 
<A NAME="514"></A>says; but only a man of experience and good habits. For in such an order 
<A NAME="515"></A>of things there will not be much opportunity for making money; no man either 
<A NAME="516"></A>ought, or indeed will be allowed, to exercise any ignoble occupation, of 
<A NAME="517"></A>which the vulgarity is a matter of reproach to a freeman, and should never 
<A NAME="518"></A>want to acquire riches by any such means.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>Further, the law enjoins that no private man shall be allowed to 
<A NAME="520"></A>possess gold and silver, but only coin for daily use, which is almost necessary 
<A NAME="521"></A>in dealing with artisans, and for payment of hirelings, whether slaves 
<A NAME="522"></A>or immigrants, by all those persons who require the use of them. Wherefore 
<A NAME="523"></A>our citizens, as we say, should have a coin passing current among themselves, 
<A NAME="524"></A>but not accepted among the rest of mankind; with a view, however, to expeditions 
<A NAME="525"></A>and journeys to other lands-for embassies, or for any other occasion which 
<A NAME="526"></A>may arise of sending out a herald, the state must also possess a common 
<A NAME="527"></A>Hellenic currency. If a private person is ever obliged to go abroad, let 
<A NAME="528"></A>him have the consent of the magistrates and go; and if when he returns 
<A NAME="529"></A>he has any foreign money remaining, let him give the surplus back to the 
<A NAME="530"></A>treasury, and receive a corresponding sum in the local currency. And if 
<A NAME="531"></A>he is discovered to appropriate it, let it be confiscated, and let him 
<A NAME="532"></A>who knows and does not inform be subject to curse and dishonour equally 
<A NAME="533"></A>him who brought the money, and also to a fine not less in amount than the 
<A NAME="534"></A>foreign money which has been brought back. In marrying and giving in marriage, 
<A NAME="535"></A>no one shall give or receive any dowry at all; and no one shall deposit 
<A NAME="536"></A>money with another whom he does not trust as a friend, nor shall he lend 
<A NAME="537"></A>money upon interest; and the borrower should be under no obligation to 
<A NAME="538"></A>repay either capital or interest. That these principles are best, any one 
<A NAME="539"></A>may see who compares them with the first principle and intention of a state. 
<A NAME="540"></A>The intention, as we affirm, of a reasonable statesman, is not what the 
<A NAME="541"></A>many declare to be the object of a good legislator, namely, that the state 
<A NAME="542"></A>for the true interests of which he is advising should be as great and as 
<A NAME="543"></A>rich as possible, and should possess gold and silver, and have the greatest 
<A NAME="544"></A>empire by sea and land;-this they imagine to be the real object of legislation, 
<A NAME="545"></A>at the same time adding, inconsistently, that the true legislator desires 
<A NAME="546"></A>to have the city the best and happiest possible. But they do not see that 
<A NAME="547"></A>some of these things are possible, and some of them are impossible; and 
<A NAME="548"></A>he who orders the state will desire what is possible, and will not indulge 
<A NAME="549"></A>in vain wishes or attempts to accomplish that which is impossible. The 
<A NAME="550"></A>citizen must indeed be happy and good, and the legislator will seek to 
<A NAME="551"></A>make him so; but very rich and very good at the same time he cannot be, 
<A NAME="552"></A>not, at least, in the sense in which the many speak of riches. For they 
<A NAME="553"></A>mean by "the rich" the few who have the most valuable possessions, although 
<A NAME="554"></A>the owner of them may quite well be a rogue. And if this is true, I can 
<A NAME="555"></A>never assent to the doctrine that the rich man will be happy-he must be 
<A NAME="556"></A>good as well as rich. And good in a high degree, and rich in a high degree 
<A NAME="557"></A>at the same time, he cannot be. Some one will ask, why not? And we shall 
<A NAME="558"></A>answer-Because acquisitions which come from sources which are just and 
<A NAME="559"></A>unjust indifferently, are more than double those which come from just sources 
<A NAME="560"></A>only; and the sums which are expended neither honourably nor disgracefully, 
<A NAME="561"></A>are only half as great as those which are expended honourably and on honourable 
<A NAME="562"></A>purposes. Thus, if the one acquires double and spends half, the other who 
<A NAME="563"></A>is in the opposite case and is a good man cannot possibly be wealthier 
<A NAME="564"></A>than he. The first-I am speaking of the saver and not of the spender-is 
<A NAME="565"></A>not always bad; he may indeed in some cases be utterly bad, but, as I was 
<A NAME="566"></A>saying, a good man he never is. For he who receives money unjustly as well 
<A NAME="567"></A>as justly, and spends neither nor unjustly, will be a rich man if he be 
<A NAME="568"></A>also thrifty. On the other hand, the utterly bad is in general profligate, 
<A NAME="569"></A>and therefore very poor; while he who spends on noble objects, and acquires 
<A NAME="570"></A>wealth by just means only, can hardly be remarkable for riches, any more 
<A NAME="571"></A>than he can be very poor. Our statement, then, is true, that the very rich 
<A NAME="572"></A>are not good, and, if they are not good, they are not happy. But the intention 
<A NAME="573"></A>of our laws was that the citizens should be as happy as may be, and as 
<A NAME="574"></A>friendly as possible to one another. And men who are always at law with 
<A NAME="575"></A>one another, and amongst whom there are many wrongs done, can never be 
<A NAME="576"></A>friends to one another, but only those among whom crimes and lawsuits are 
<A NAME="577"></A>few and slight. Therefore we say that gold and silver ought not to be allowed 
<A NAME="578"></A>in the city, nor much of the vulgar sort of trade which is carried on by 
<A NAME="579"></A>lending money, or rearing the meaner kinds of live stock; but only the 
<A NAME="580"></A>produce of agriculture, and only so much of this as will not compel us 
<A NAME="581"></A>in pursuing it to neglect that for the sake of which riches exist-I mean, 
<A NAME="582"></A>soul and body, which without gymnastics, and without education, will never 
<A NAME="583"></A>be worth anything; and therefore, as we have said not once but many times, 
<A NAME="584"></A>the care of riches should have the last place in our thoughts. For there 
<A NAME="585"></A>are in all three things about which every man has an interest; and the 
<A NAME="586"></A>interest about money, when rightly regarded, is the third and lowest of 
<A NAME="587"></A>them: midway comes the interest of the body; and, first of all, that of 
<A NAME="588"></A>the soul; and the state which we are describing will have been rightly 
<A NAME="589"></A>constituted if it ordains honours according to this scale. But if, in any 
<A NAME="590"></A>of the laws which have been ordained, health has been preferred to temperance, 
<A NAME="591"></A>or wealth to health and temperate habits, that law must clearly be wrong. 
<A NAME="592"></A>Wherefore, also, the legislator ought often to impress upon himself the 
<A NAME="593"></A>question-"What do I want?" and "Do I attain my aim, or do I miss the mark?" 
<A NAME="594"></A>In this way, and in this way only, he ma acquit himself and free others 
<A NAME="595"></A>from the work of legislation.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>Let the allottee then hold his lot upon the conditions which we 
<A NAME="597"></A>have mentioned.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>It would be well that every man should come to the colony having 
<A NAME="599"></A>all things equal; but seeing that this is not possible, and one man will 
<A NAME="600"></A>have greater possessions than another, for many reasons and in particular 
<A NAME="601"></A>in order to preserve equality in special crises of the state, qualifications 
<A NAME="602"></A>of property must be unequal, in order that offices and contributions and 
<A NAME="603"></A>distributions may be proportioned to the value of each person's wealth, 
<A NAME="604"></A>and not solely to the virtue of his ancestors or himself, nor yet to the 
<A NAME="605"></A>strength and beauty of his person, but also to the measure of his wealth 
<A NAME="606"></A>or poverty; and so by a law of inequality, which will be in proportion 
<A NAME="607"></A>to his wealth, he will receive honours and offices as equally as possible, 
<A NAME="608"></A>and there will be no quarrels and disputes. To which end there should be 
<A NAME="609"></A>four different standards appointed according to the amount of property: 
<A NAME="610"></A>there should be a first and a second and a third and a fourth class, in 
<A NAME="611"></A>which the citizens will be placed, and they will be called by these or 
<A NAME="612"></A>similar names: they may continue in the same rank, or pass into another 
<A NAME="613"></A>in any individual case, on becoming richer from being, poorer, or poorer 
<A NAME="614"></A>from being richer. The form of law which I should propose as the natural 
<A NAME="615"></A>sequel would be as follows:-In a state which is desirous of being saved 
<A NAME="616"></A>from the greatest of all plagues-not faction, but rather distraction;-here 
<A NAME="617"></A>should exist among the citizens neither extreme poverty, nor, again, excess 
<A NAME="618"></A>of wealth, for both are productive of both these evils. Now the legislator 
<A NAME="619"></A>should determine what is to be the limit of poverty or wealth. Let the 
<A NAME="620"></A>limit of poverty be the value of the lot; this ought to be preserved, and 
<A NAME="621"></A>no ruler, nor any one else who aspires after a reputation for virtue, will 
<A NAME="622"></A>allow the lot to be impaired in any case. This the legislator gives as 
<A NAME="623"></A>a measure, and he will permit a man to acquire double or triple, or as 
<A NAME="624"></A>much as four times the amount of this. But if a person have yet greater 
<A NAME="625"></A>riches, whether he has found them, or they have been given to him, or he 
<A NAME="626"></A>has made them in business, or has acquired by any stroke of fortune that 
<A NAME="627"></A>which is in excess of the measure, if he give back the surplus to the state, 
<A NAME="628"></A>and to the Gods who are the patrons of the state, he shall suffer no penalty 
<A NAME="629"></A>or loss of reputation; but if he disobeys this our law any one who likes 
<A NAME="630"></A>may inform against him and receive half the value of the excess, and the 
<A NAME="631"></A>delinquent shall pay a sum equal to the excess out of his own property, 
<A NAME="632"></A>and the other half of the excess shall belong to the Gods. And let every 
<A NAME="633"></A>possession of every man, with the exception of the lot, be publicly registered 
<A NAME="634"></A>before the magistrates whom the law appoints, so that all suits about money 
<A NAME="635"></A>may be easy and quite simple.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>The next thing to be noted is, that the city should be placed as 
<A NAME="637"></A>nearly as possible in the centre of the country; we should choose a place 
<A NAME="638"></A>which possesses what is suitable for a city, and this may easily be imagined 
<A NAME="639"></A>and described. Then we will divide the city into twelve portions, first 
<A NAME="640"></A>founding temples to Hestia, to Zeus and to Athene, in a spot which we will 
<A NAME="641"></A>call the Acropolis, and surround with a circular wall, making the division 
<A NAME="642"></A>of the entire city and country radiate from this point. The twelve portions 
<A NAME="643"></A>shall be equalized by the provision that those which are of good land shall 
<A NAME="644"></A>be smaller. while those of inferior quality shall be larger. The number 
<A NAME="645"></A>of the lots shall be 5040, and each of them shall be divided into two, 
<A NAME="646"></A>and every allotment shall be composed of two such sections; one of land 
<A NAME="647"></A>near the city, the other of land which is at a distance. This arrangement 
<A NAME="648"></A>shall be carried out in the following manner: The section which is near 
<A NAME="649"></A>the city shall be added to that which is on borders, and form one lot, 
<A NAME="650"></A>and the portion which is next nearest shall be added to the portion which 
<A NAME="651"></A>is next farthest; and so of the rest. Moreover, in the two sections of 
<A NAME="652"></A>the lots the same principle of equalization of the soil ought to be maintained; 
<A NAME="653"></A>the badness and goodness shall be compensated by more and less. And the 
<A NAME="654"></A>legislator shall divide the citizens into twelve parts, and arrange the 
<A NAME="655"></A>rest of their property, as far as possible, so as to form twelve equal 
<A NAME="656"></A>parts; and there shall be a registration of all. After this they shall 
<A NAME="657"></A>assign twelve lots to twelve Gods, and call them by their names, and dedicate 
<A NAME="658"></A>to each God their several portions, and call the tribes after them. And 
<A NAME="659"></A>they shall distribute the twelve divisions of the city in the same way 
<A NAME="660"></A>in which they divided the country; and every man shall have two habitations, 
<A NAME="661"></A>one in the centre of the country, and the other at the extremity. Enough 
<A NAME="662"></A>of the manner of settlement.
<A NAME="663"></A><BR><BR>Now we ought by all means to consider that there can never be such 
<A NAME="664"></A>a happy concurrence of circumstances as we have described; neither can 
<A NAME="665"></A>all things coincide as they are wanted. Men who will not take offence at 
<A NAME="666"></A>such a mode of living together, and will endure all their life long to 
<A NAME="667"></A>have their property fixed at a moderate limit, and to beget children in 
<A NAME="668"></A>accordance with our ordinances, and will allow themselves to be deprived 
<A NAME="669"></A>of gold and other things which the legislator, as is evident from these 
<A NAME="670"></A>enactments, will certainly forbid them; and will endure, further, the situation 
<A NAME="671"></A>of the land with the city in the middle and dwellings round about;-all 
<A NAME="672"></A>this is as if the legislator were telling his dreams, or making a city 
<A NAME="673"></A>and citizens of wax. There is truth in these objections, and therefore 
<A NAME="674"></A>every one should take to heart what I am going to say. Once more, then, 
<A NAME="675"></A>the legislator shall appear and address us:-"O my friends," he will say 
<A NAME="676"></A>to us, "do not suppose me ignorant that there is a certain degree of truth 
<A NAME="677"></A>in your words; but I am of opinion that, in matters which are not present 
<A NAME="678"></A>but future, he who exhibits a pattern of that at which he aims, should 
<A NAME="679"></A>in nothing fall short of the fairest and truest; and that if he finds any 
<A NAME="680"></A>part of this work impossible of execution he should avoid and not execute 
<A NAME="681"></A>it, but he should contrive to carry out that which is nearest and most 
<A NAME="682"></A>akin to it; you must allow the legislator to perfect his design, and when 
<A NAME="683"></A>it is perfected, you should join with him in considering what part of his 
<A NAME="684"></A>legislation is expedient and what will arouse opposition; for surely the 
<A NAME="685"></A>artist who is to be deemed worthy of any regard at all, ought always to 
<A NAME="686"></A>make his work self-consistent."
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR>Having determined that there is to be a distribution into twelve 
<A NAME="688"></A>parts, let us now see in what way this may be accomplished. There is no 
<A NAME="689"></A>difficulty in perceiving that the twelve parts admit of the greatest number 
<A NAME="690"></A>of divisions of that which they include, or in seeing the other numbers 
<A NAME="691"></A>which are consequent upon them, and are produced out of them up to 5040; 
<A NAME="692"></A>wherefore the law ought to order phratries and demes and villages, and 
<A NAME="693"></A>also military ranks and movements, as well as coins and measures, dry and 
<A NAME="694"></A>liquid, and weights, so as to be commensurable and agreeable to one another. 
<A NAME="695"></A>Nor should we fear the appearance of minuteness, if the law commands that 
<A NAME="696"></A>all the vessels which a man possesses should have a common measure, when 
<A NAME="697"></A>we consider generally that the divisions and variations of numbers have 
<A NAME="698"></A>a use in respect of all the variations of which they are susceptible, both 
<A NAME="699"></A>in themselves and as measures of height and depth, and in all sounds, and 
<A NAME="700"></A>in motions, as well those which proceed in a straight direction, upwards 
<A NAME="701"></A>or downwards, as in those which go round and round. The legislator is to 
<A NAME="702"></A>consider all these things and to bid the citizens, as far as possible, 
<A NAME="703"></A>not to lose sight of numerical order; for no single instrument of youthful 
<A NAME="704"></A>education has such mighty power, both as regards domestic economy and politics, 
<A NAME="705"></A>and in the arts, as the study of arithmetic. Above all, arithmetic stirs 
<A NAME="706"></A>up him who is by nature sleepy and dull, and makes him quick to learn, 
<A NAME="707"></A>retentive, shrewd, and aided by art divine he makes progress quite beyond 
<A NAME="708"></A>his natural powers. All such things, if only the legislator, by other laws 
<A NAME="709"></A>and institutions, can banish meanness and covetousness from the souls of 
<A NAME="710"></A>men, so that they can use them properly and to their own good, will be 
<A NAME="711"></A>excellent and suitable instruments of education. But if he cannot, he will 
<A NAME="712"></A>unintentionally create in them, instead of wisdom, the habit of craft, 
<A NAME="713"></A>which evil tendency may be observed in the Egyptians and Phoenicians, and 
<A NAME="714"></A>many other races, through the general vulgarity of their pursuits and acquisitions, 
<A NAME="715"></A>whether some unworthy legislator theirs has been the cause, or some impediment 
<A NAME="716"></A>of chance or nature. For we must not fail to observe, O Megillus and Cleinias, 
<A NAME="717"></A>that there is a difference in places, and that some beget better men and 
<A NAME="718"></A>others worse; and we must legislate accordingly. Some places are subject 
<A NAME="719"></A>to strange and fatal influences by reason of diverse winds and violent 
<A NAME="720"></A>heats, some by reason of waters; or, again, from the character of the food 
<A NAME="721"></A>given by the earth, which not only affects the bodies of men for good or 
<A NAME="722"></A>evil, but produces similar results in their souls. And in all such qualities 
<A NAME="723"></A>those spots excel in which there is a divine inspiration, and in which 
<A NAME="724"></A>the demi-gods have their appointed lots, and are propitious, not adverse, 
<A NAME="725"></A>to the settlers in them. To all these matters the legislator, if he have 
<A NAME="726"></A>any sense in him, will attend as far as man can, and frame his laws accordingly. 
<A NAME="727"></A>And this is what you, Cleinias, must do, and to matters of this kind you 
<A NAME="728"></A>must turn your mind since you are going to colonize a new 
<A NAME="729"></A>country.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR><BR><B>Cleinias.</B> Your words, Athenian Stranger, are excellent, 
<A NAME="731"></A>and I will do as you say.
