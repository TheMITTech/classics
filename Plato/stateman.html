<A NAME="15"></A><BR><BR><B>Socrates.</B> I owe you many thanks, indeed, Theodorus, for 
<A NAME="16"></A>the acquaintance both of Theaetetus and of the Stranger.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR><B>Theodorus.</B> And in a little while, Socrates, you will owe 
<A NAME="18"></A>me three times as many, when they have completed for you the delineation 
<A NAME="19"></A>of the Statesman and of the Philosopher, as well as of the 
<A NAME="20"></A>Sophist.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Sophist, statesman, philosopher! O my dear Theodorus, 
<A NAME="22"></A>do my ears truly witness that this is the estimate formed of them by the 
<A NAME="23"></A>great calculator and geometrician?
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> What do you mean, Socrates?
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I mean that you rate them all at the same value, whereas 
<A NAME="26"></A>they are really separated by an interval, which no geometrical ratio can 
<A NAME="27"></A>express.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> By Ammon, the god of Cyrene, Socrates, that is a 
<A NAME="29"></A>very fair hit; and shows that you have not forgotten your geometry. I will 
<A NAME="30"></A>retaliate on you at some other time, but I must now ask the Stranger, who 
<A NAME="31"></A>will not, I hope, tire of his goodness to us, to proceed either with the 
<A NAME="32"></A>Statesman or with the Philosopher, whichever he prefers.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR><B>Stranger.</B> That is my duty, Theodorus; having begun I must 
<A NAME="34"></A>go on, and not leave the work unfinished. But what shall be done with 
<A NAME="35"></A>Theaetetus?
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> In what respect?
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Shall we relieve him, and take his companion, the Young 
<A NAME="38"></A>Socrates, instead of him? What do you advise?
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR><B>Theod.</B> Yes, give the other a turn, as you propose. The young 
<A NAME="40"></A>always do better when they have intervals of rest.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I think, Stranger, that both of them may be said to 
<A NAME="42"></A>be in some way related to me; for the one, as you affirm, has the cut of 
<A NAME="43"></A>my ugly face, the other is called by my name. And we should always be on 
<A NAME="44"></A>the look-out to recognize a kinsman by the style of his conversation. I 
<A NAME="45"></A>myself was discoursing with Theaetetus yesterday, and I have just been 
<A NAME="46"></A>listening to his answers; my namesake I have not yet examined, but I must. 
<A NAME="47"></A>Another time will, do for me; to-day let him answer 
<A NAME="48"></A>you.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Very good. Young Socrates, do you hear what the elder 
<A NAME="50"></A>Socrates is proposing?
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>Young Socrates. I do.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And do you agree to his proposal?
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> As you do not object, still less can I. After the Sophist, 
<A NAME="55"></A>then, I think that the Statesman naturally follows next in the order of 
<A NAME="56"></A>enquiry. And please to say, whether he, too, should be ranked among those 
<A NAME="57"></A>who have science.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then the sciences must be divided as 
<A NAME="60"></A>before?
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. I dare say.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But yet the division will not be the 
<A NAME="63"></A>same?
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. How then?
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> They will be divided at some other 
<A NAME="66"></A>point.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Where shall we discover the path of the Statesman? 
<A NAME="69"></A>We must find and separate off, and set our seal upon this, and we will 
<A NAME="70"></A>set the mark of another class upon all diverging paths. Thus the soul will 
<A NAME="71"></A>conceive of ail kinds of knowledge under two classes.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. To find the path is your business, Stranger, and 
<A NAME="73"></A>not mine.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Yes, Socrates, but the discovery, when once made, must 
<A NAME="75"></A>be yours as well as mine.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very good.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Well, and are not arithmetic and certain other kindred 
<A NAME="78"></A>arts, merely abstract knowledge, wholly separated from 
<A NAME="79"></A>action?
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. True.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But in the art of carpentering and all other handicrafts, 
<A NAME="82"></A>the knowledge of the workman is merged in his work; he not only knows, 
<A NAME="83"></A>but he also makes things which previously did not exist.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then let us divide sciences in general into those which 
<A NAME="86"></A>are practical and those which are-purely intellectual.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Let us assume these two divisions of science, which 
<A NAME="88"></A>is one whole.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And are "statesman," "king," "master," or "householder," 
<A NAME="90"></A>one and the same; or is there a science or art answering to each of these 
<A NAME="91"></A>names? Or rather, allow me to put the matter in another 
<A NAME="92"></A>way.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Let me hear.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> If any one who is in a private station has the skill 
<A NAME="95"></A>to advise one of the public physicians, must not he also be called a 
<A NAME="96"></A>physician?
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And if any one who is in a private station is able 
<A NAME="99"></A>to advise the ruler of a country, may not he be said to have the knowledge 
<A NAME="100"></A>which the ruler himself ought to have?
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. True.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But, surely the science of a true king is royal 
<A NAME="103"></A>science?
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And will not he who possesses this knowledge, whether 
<A NAME="106"></A>he happens to be a ruler or a private man, when regarded only in reference 
<A NAME="107"></A>to his art, be truly called "royal"?
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. He certainly ought to be.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And the householder and master are the 
<A NAME="110"></A>same?
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Of course.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Again, a large household may be compared to a small 
<A NAME="113"></A>state:-will they differ at all, as far as government is 
<A NAME="114"></A>concerned?
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. They will not.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then, returning to the point which we were just now 
<A NAME="117"></A>discussing, do we not clearly see that there is one science of all of them; 
<A NAME="118"></A>and this science may be called either royal or political or economical; 
<A NAME="119"></A>we will not quarrel with any one about the name.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly not.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> This too, is evident, that the king cannot do much 
<A NAME="122"></A>with his hands, or with his whole body, towards the maintenance of his 
<A NAME="123"></A>empire, compared with what he does by the intelligence and strength of 
<A NAME="124"></A>his mind.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Clearly not.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then, shall we say that the king has a greater affinity 
<A NAME="127"></A>to knowledge than to manual arts and to practical life in 
<A NAME="128"></A>general?
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly he has.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then we may put all together as one and the same-statesmanship 
<A NAME="131"></A>and the statesman-the kingly science and the king.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Clearly.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And now we shall only be proceeding in due order if 
<A NAME="134"></A>we go on to divide the sphere of knowledge?
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very good.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Think whether you can find any joint or parting in 
<A NAME="137"></A>knowledge.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Tell me of what sort.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Such as this: You may remember that we made an art 
<A NAME="140"></A>of calculation?
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Which was, unmistakably, one of the arts of 
<A NAME="143"></A>knowledge?
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And to this art of calculation which discerns the differences 
<A NAME="146"></A>of numbers shall we assign any other function except to pass judgment on 
<A NAME="147"></A>their differences?
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. How could we?
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> You know that the master-builder does not work himself, 
<A NAME="150"></A>but is the ruler of workmen?
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> He contributes knowledge, not manual 
<A NAME="153"></A>labour?
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. True.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And may therefore be justly said to share in theoretical 
<A NAME="156"></A>science?
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Quite true.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But he ought not, like the calculator, to regard his 
<A NAME="159"></A>functions as at and when he has formed a judgment;-he must assign to the 
<A NAME="160"></A>individual workmen their appropriate task until they have completed the 
<A NAME="161"></A>work.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. True.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Are not all such sciences, no less than arithmetic 
<A NAME="164"></A>and the like, subjects of pure knowledge; and is not the difference between 
<A NAME="165"></A>the two classes, that the one sort has the power of judging only, and the 
<A NAME="166"></A>other of ruling as well?
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. That is evident.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> May we not very properly say, that of all knowledge, 
<A NAME="169"></A>there are there are two divisions-one which rules, and the other which 
<A NAME="170"></A>judges?
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. I should think so.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And when men have anything to do in common, that they 
<A NAME="173"></A>should be of one mind is surely a desirable thing?
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very true.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then while we are at unity among ourselves, we need 
<A NAME="176"></A>not mind about the fancies of others?
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly not.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And now, in which of these divisions shall we place 
<A NAME="179"></A>the king?-Is he a judge and a kind of spectator? Or shall we assign to 
<A NAME="180"></A>him the art of command-for he is a ruler?
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. The latter, clearly.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then we must see whether there is any mark of division 
<A NAME="183"></A>in the art of command too. I am inclined to think that there is a distinction 
<A NAME="184"></A>similar to that of manufacturer and retail dealer, which parts off the 
<A NAME="185"></A>king from the herald.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. How is this?
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Why, does not the retailer receive and sell over again 
<A NAME="188"></A>the productions of others, which have been sold before?
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly he does.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And is not the herald under command, and does he not 
<A NAME="191"></A>receive orders, and in his turn give them to others?
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very true.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then shall we mingle the kingly art in the same class 
<A NAME="194"></A>with the art of the herald, the interpreter, the boatswain, the prophet, 
<A NAME="195"></A>and the numerous kindred arts which exercise command; or, as in the preceding 
<A NAME="196"></A>comparison we spoke of manufacturers, or sellers for themselves, and of 
<A NAME="197"></A>retailers,-seeing, too, that the class of supreme rulers, or rulers for 
<A NAME="198"></A>themselves, is almost nameless-shall we make a word following the same 
<A NAME="199"></A>analogy, and refer kings to a supreme or ruling-for-self science, leaving 
<A NAME="200"></A>the rest to receive a name from some one else? For we are seeking the ruler; 
<A NAME="201"></A>and our enquiry is not concerned with him who is not a 
<A NAME="202"></A>ruler.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very good.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Thus a very fair distinction has been attained between 
<A NAME="205"></A>the man who gives his own commands, and him who gives another's. And now 
<A NAME="206"></A>let us see if the supreme power allows of any further 
<A NAME="207"></A>division.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. By all means.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I think that it does; and please to assist me in making 
<A NAME="210"></A>the division.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. At what point?
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> May not all rulers be supposed to command for the sake 
<A NAME="213"></A>of producing something?
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Nor is there any difficulty in dividing the things 
<A NAME="216"></A>produced into two classes.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. How would you divide them?
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Of the whole class some have life and some are without 
<A NAME="219"></A>life.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. True.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And by the help of this distinction we may make, if 
<A NAME="222"></A>we please, a subdivision of the section of knowledge which 
<A NAME="223"></A>commands.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. At what point?
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> One part may be set over the production of lifeless, 
<A NAME="226"></A>the other of living objects; and in this way the whole will be 
<A NAME="227"></A>divided.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> That division, then, is complete; and now we may leave 
<A NAME="230"></A>one half, and take up the other; which may also be divided into 
<A NAME="231"></A>two.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Which of the two halves do you 
<A NAME="233"></A>men?
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Of course that which exercises command about animals. 
<A NAME="235"></A>For, surely, the royal science is not like that of a master-workman, a 
<A NAME="236"></A>science presiding over lifeless objects;-the king has a nobler function, 
<A NAME="237"></A>which is the management and control of living beings.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. True.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And the breeding and tending of living beings may be 
<A NAME="240"></A>observed to be sometimes a tending of the individual; in other cases, a 
<A NAME="241"></A>common care of creatures in flocks?
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. True.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But the statesman is not a tender of individuals-not 
<A NAME="244"></A>like the driver or groom of a single ox or horse; he is rather to be compared 
<A NAME="245"></A>with the keeper of a drove of horses or oxen.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes, I see, thanks to you.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Shall we call this art of tending many animals together, 
<A NAME="248"></A>the art of managing a herd, or the art of collective 
<A NAME="249"></A>management?
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. No matter;-Whichever suggests itself to us in the 
<A NAME="251"></A>course of conversation.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Very good, Socrates; and, if you continue to be not 
<A NAME="253"></A>too particular about names, you will be all the richer in wisdom when you 
<A NAME="254"></A>are an old man. And now, as you say, leaving the discussion of the name, 
<A NAME="255"></A>-can you see a way in which a person, by showing the art of herding to 
<A NAME="256"></A>be of two kinds, may cause that which is now sought amongst twice the number 
<A NAME="257"></A>of things, to be then sought amongst half that number?
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. I will try;-there appears to me to be one management 
<A NAME="259"></A>of men and another of beasts.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> You have certainly divided them in a most straightforward 
<A NAME="261"></A>and manly style; but you have fallen into an error which hereafter I think 
<A NAME="262"></A>that we had better avoid.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What is the error?
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I think that we had better not cut off a single small 
<A NAME="265"></A>portion which is not a species, from many larger portions; the part should 
<A NAME="266"></A>be a species. To separate off at once the subject of investigation, is 
<A NAME="267"></A>a most excellent plan, if only the separation be rightly made; and you 
<A NAME="268"></A>were under the impression that you were right, because you saw that you 
<A NAME="269"></A>would come to man; and this led you to hasten the steps. But you should 
<A NAME="270"></A>not chip off too small a piece, my friend; the safer way is to cut through 
<A NAME="271"></A>the middle; which is also the more likely way of finding classes. Attention 
<A NAME="272"></A>to this principle makes all the difference in a process of 
<A NAME="273"></A>enquiry.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What do you mean, Stranger?
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I will endeavour to speak more plainly out of love 
<A NAME="276"></A>to your good parts, Socrates; and, although I cannot at present entirely 
<A NAME="277"></A>explain myself, I will try, as we proceed, to make my meaning a little 
<A NAME="278"></A>clearer.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What was the error of which, as you say, we were 
<A NAME="280"></A>guilty in our recent division?
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The error was just as if some one who wanted to divide 
<A NAME="282"></A>the human race, were to divide them after the fashion which prevails in 
<A NAME="283"></A>this part of the world; here they cut off the Hellenes as one species, 
<A NAME="284"></A>and all the other species of mankind, which are innumerable, and have no 
<A NAME="285"></A>ties or common language, they include under the single name of "barbarians," 
<A NAME="286"></A>and because they have one name they are supposed to be of one species also. 
<A NAME="287"></A>Or suppose that in dividing numbers you were to cut off ten thousand from 
<A NAME="288"></A>all the rest, and make of it one species, comprehending the first under 
<A NAME="289"></A>another separate name, you might say that here too was a single class, 
<A NAME="290"></A>because you had given it a single name. Whereas you would make a much better 
<A NAME="291"></A>and more equal and logical classification of numbers, if you divided them 
<A NAME="292"></A>into odd and even; or of the human species, if you divided them into male 
<A NAME="293"></A>and female; and only separated off Lydians or Phrygians, or any other tribe, 
<A NAME="294"></A>and arrayed them against the rest of the world, when you could no longer 
<A NAME="295"></A>make a division into parts which were also classes.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very true; but I wish that this distinction between 
<A NAME="297"></A>a part and a class could still be made somewhat plainer.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> O Socrates, best of men, you are imposing upon me a 
<A NAME="299"></A>very difficult task. We have already digressed further from our original 
<A NAME="300"></A>intention than we ought, and you would have us wander still further away. 
<A NAME="301"></A>But we must now return to our subject; and hereafter, when there is a leisure 
<A NAME="302"></A>hour, we will follow up the other track; at the same time I wish you to 
<A NAME="303"></A>guard against imagining that you ever heard me declare-
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What?
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> That a class and a part are distinct.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What did I hear, then?
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> That a class is necessarily a part, but there is no 
<A NAME="308"></A>similar necessity that a part should be a dass; that is the view which 
<A NAME="309"></A>I should always wish you to attribute to me, Socrates.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. So be it.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There is another thing which I should like to 
<A NAME="312"></A>know.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What is it?
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The point at which we digressed; for, if I am not mistaken, 
<A NAME="315"></A>the exact place was at the question, Where you would divide the management 
<A NAME="316"></A>of herds. To this you appeared rather too ready to answer that them were 
<A NAME="317"></A>two species of animals; man being one, and all brutes making up the 
<A NAME="318"></A>other.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. True.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I thought that in taking away a part you imagined that 
<A NAME="321"></A>the remainder formed a class, because you were able to call them by the 
<A NAME="322"></A>common name of brutes.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. That again is true.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Suppose now, O most courageous of dialecticians, that 
<A NAME="325"></A>some wise and understanding creature, such as a crane is reputed to be, 
<A NAME="326"></A>were, in imitation of you, to make a similar division, and set up cranes 
<A NAME="327"></A>against all other animals to their own special glorification, at the same 
<A NAME="328"></A>time jumbling together all the others, including man, under the appellation 
<A NAME="329"></A>of brutes,-here would be the sort of error which we must try to 
<A NAME="330"></A>avoid.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. How can we be safe?
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> If we do not divide the whole class of animals, we 
<A NAME="333"></A>shall be less likely to fall into that error.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. We had better not take the whole?
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Yes, there lay the source of error in our former 
<A NAME="336"></A>division.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. How?
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> You remember how that part of the art of knowledge 
<A NAME="339"></A>which was concerned with command, had to do with the rearing of living 
<A NAME="340"></A>creatures,-I mean, with animals in herds?
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> In that case, there was already implied a division 
<A NAME="343"></A>of all animals into tame and wild; those whose nature can be tamed are 
<A NAME="344"></A>called tame, and those which cannot be tamed are called 
<A NAME="345"></A>wild.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. True.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And the political science of which we are in search, 
<A NAME="348"></A>is and ever was concerned with tame animals, and is also confined to gregarious 
<A NAME="349"></A>animals.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But then ought not to divide, as we did, taking the 
<A NAME="352"></A>whole class at once. Neither let us be in too great haste to arrive quickly 
<A NAME="353"></A>at the political science; for this mistake has already brought upon us 
<A NAME="354"></A>the misfortune of which the proverb speaks.
<A NAME="355"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What misfortune?
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The misfortune of too much haste, which is too little 
<A NAME="357"></A>speed.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. And all the better, Stranger;-we got what we 
<A NAME="359"></A>deserved.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Very well: Let us then begin again, and endeavour to 
<A NAME="361"></A>divide the collective rearing of animals; for probably the completion of 
<A NAME="362"></A>the argument will best show what you are so anxious to know. Tell me, 
<A NAME="363"></A>then-
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What?
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Have you ever heard, as you very likely may-for I do 
<A NAME="366"></A>not suppose that you ever actually visited them-of the preserves of fishes 
<A NAME="367"></A>in the Nile, and in the ponds of the Great King; or you may have seen similar 
<A NAME="368"></A>preserves in wells at home?
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes, to be sure, I have seen them, and I have often 
<A NAME="370"></A>heard the others described.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And you may have heard also, and may have been-assured 
<A NAME="372"></A>by report, although you have not travelled in those regions, of nurseries 
<A NAME="373"></A>of geese and cranes in the plains of Thessaly?
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I asked you, because here is a new division of the 
<A NAME="376"></A>management of herds, into the management of land and of water 
<A NAME="377"></A>herds.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. There is.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And do you agree that we ought to divide the collective 
<A NAME="380"></A>rearing of herds into two corresponding parts, the one the rearing of water, 
<A NAME="381"></A>and the other the rearing of land herds?
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There is surely no need to ask which of these two contains 
<A NAME="384"></A>the royal art, for it is evident to everybody.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Any one can divide the herds which feed on dry 
<A NAME="387"></A>land?
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. How would you divide them?
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I should distinguish between those which fly and those 
<A NAME="390"></A>which walk.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Most true.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And where shall we look for the political animal? Might 
<A NAME="393"></A>not an idiot, so to speak, know that he is a pedestrian?
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The art of managing the walking animal has to be further 
<A NAME="396"></A>divided, just as you might have an even number.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Clearly.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Let me note that here appear in view two ways to that 
<A NAME="399"></A>part or class which the argument aims at reaching-the one is speedier way, 
<A NAME="400"></A>which cuts off a small portion and leaves a large; the other agrees better 
<A NAME="401"></A>with the principle which we were laying down, that as far as we can we 
<A NAME="402"></A>should divide in the middle; but it is longer. We can take either of them, 
<A NAME="403"></A>whichever we please.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Cannot we have both ways?
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Together? What a thing to ask! but, if you take them 
<A NAME="406"></A>in turn, you clearly may.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Then I should like to have them in 
<A NAME="408"></A>turn.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There will be no difficulty, as we are near the end; 
<A NAME="410"></A>if we had been at the beginning, or in the middle, I should have demurred 
<A NAME="411"></A>to your request; but now, in accordance with your desire, let us begin 
<A NAME="412"></A>with the longer way; while we are fresh, we shall get on better. And now 
<A NAME="413"></A>attend to the division.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Let me hear.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The tame walking herding animals are distributed by 
<A NAME="416"></A>nature into two classes.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Upon what principle?
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The one grows horns; and the other is without 
<A NAME="419"></A>horns.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Clearly.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Suppose that you divide the science which manages pedestrian 
<A NAME="422"></A>animals into two corresponding parts, and define them; for if you try to 
<A NAME="423"></A>invent names for them, you will find the intricacy too 
<A NAME="424"></A>great.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. How must I speak of them, then?
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> In this way: let the science of managing pedestrian 
<A NAME="427"></A>animals be divided into two parts and one part assigned to the horned herd 
<A NAME="428"></A>and the other to the herd that has no horns.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. All that you say has been abundantly proved, and 
<A NAME="430"></A>may therefore, be assumed.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The king is clearly the shepherd a polled herd, who 
<A NAME="432"></A>have no horns.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. That is evident.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Shall we break up this hornless herd into sections, 
<A NAME="435"></A>and endeavour to assign to him what is his?
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. By all means.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Shall we distinguish them by their having or not having 
<A NAME="438"></A>cloven feet, or by their mixing or not mixing the breed? You know what 
<A NAME="439"></A>I mean.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What?
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I mean that horses and asses naturally breed from one 
<A NAME="442"></A>another.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But the remainder of the hornless herd of tame animals 
<A NAME="445"></A>will not mix the breed.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very true.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And of which has the Statesman charge,-of the mixed 
<A NAME="448"></A>or of the unmixed race?
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Clearly of the unmixed.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I suppose that we must divide this again as 
<A NAME="451"></A>before.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. We must.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Every tame and herding animal has now been split up, 
<A NAME="454"></A>with the exception of two species; for I hardly think that dogs should 
<A NAME="455"></A>be reckoned among gregarious animals.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly not; but how shall we divide the two remaining 
<A NAME="457"></A>species?
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There is a measure of difference which may be appropriately 
<A NAME="459"></A>employed by you and Theaetetus, who are students of 
<A NAME="460"></A>geometry.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What is that?
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The diameter; and, again, the diameter of a 
<A NAME="463"></A>diameter.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What do you mean?
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> How does man walk, but as a diameter whose power is 
<A NAME="466"></A>two feet?
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Just so.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And the power of the remaining kind, being the power 
<A NAME="469"></A>of twice two feet, may be said to be the diameter of our 
<A NAME="470"></A>diameter.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly; and now I think that I pretty nearly 
<A NAME="472"></A>understand you.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> In these divisions, Socrates, I descry what would make 
<A NAME="474"></A>another famous jest.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What is it?
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Human beings have come out in the same class with the 
<A NAME="477"></A>freest and airiest of creation, and have been running a race with 
<A NAME="478"></A>them.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. I remark that very singular coincidence.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And would you not expect the slowest to arrive 
<A NAME="481"></A>last?
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Indeed I should.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And there is a still more ridiculous consequence, that 
<A NAME="484"></A>the king is found running about with the herd and in close competition 
<A NAME="485"></A>with the bird-catcher, who of all mankind is most of an adept at the airy 
<A NAME="486"></A>life.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then here, Socrates, is still clearer evidence of the 
<A NAME="489"></A>truth of what was said in the enquiry about the Sophist?
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What?
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> That the dialectical method is no respecter of persons, 
<A NAME="492"></A>and does not set the great above the small, but always arrives in her own 
<A NAME="493"></A>way at the truest result.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Clearly.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And now, I will not wait for you to ask the, but will 
<A NAME="496"></A>of my own accord take you by the shorter road to the definition of a 
<A NAME="497"></A>king.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. By all means.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I say that we should have begun at first by dividing 
<A NAME="500"></A>land animals into biped and quadruped; and since the winged herd, and that 
<A NAME="501"></A>alone, comes out in the same class with man, should divide bipeds into 
<A NAME="502"></A>those which have feathers and those which have not, and when they have 
<A NAME="503"></A>been divided, and the art of the management of mankind is brought to light, 
<A NAME="504"></A>the time will have come to produce our Statesman and ruler, and set him 
<A NAME="505"></A>like a charioteer in his place, and hand over to him the reins of state, 
<A NAME="506"></A>for that too is a vocation which belongs to him.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very good; you have paid me the debt-I mean, that 
<A NAME="508"></A>you have completed the argument, and I suppose that you added the digression 
<A NAME="509"></A>by way of interest.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then now, let us go back to the beginning, and join 
<A NAME="511"></A>the links, which together make the definition of the name of the Statesman's 
<A NAME="512"></A>art.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. By all means.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The science of pure knowledge had, as we said originally, 
<A NAME="515"></A>a part which was the science of rule or command, and from this was derived 
<A NAME="516"></A>another part, which was called command-for-self, on the analogy of selling-for-self; 
<A NAME="517"></A>an important section of this was the management of living animals, and 
<A NAME="518"></A>this again was further limited to the manage merit of them in herds; and 
<A NAME="519"></A>again in herds of pedestrian animals. The chief division of the latter 
<A NAME="520"></A>was the art of managing pedestrian animals which are without horns; this 
<A NAME="521"></A>again has a part which can only be comprehended under one term by joining 
<A NAME="522"></A>together three names-shepherding pure-bred animals. The only further subdivision 
<A NAME="523"></A>is the art of man herding-this has to do with bipeds, and is what we were 
<A NAME="524"></A>seeking after, and have now found, being at once the royal and 
<A NAME="525"></A>political.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. To be sure.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And do you think, Socrates, that we really have done 
<A NAME="528"></A>as you say?
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What?
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Do you think, I mean, that we have really fulfilled 
<A NAME="531"></A>our intention?-There has been a sort of discussion, and yet the investigation 
<A NAME="532"></A>seems to me not to be perfectly worked out: this is where the enquiry 
<A NAME="533"></A>fails.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. I do not understand.
<A NAME="535"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I will try to make the thought, which is at this moment 
<A NAME="536"></A>present in my mind, clearer to us both.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Let me hear.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There were many arts of shepherding, and one of them 
<A NAME="539"></A>was the political, which had the charge of one particular 
<A NAME="540"></A>herd?
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And this the argument defined to be the art of rearing, 
<A NAME="543"></A>not horses or other brutes, but the art of rearing man 
<A NAME="544"></A>collectively?
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. True.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Note, however, a difference which distinguishes the 
<A NAME="547"></A>king from all other shepherds.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. To what do you refer?
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I want to ask, whether any one of the other herdsmen 
<A NAME="550"></A>has a rival who professes and claims to share with him in the management 
<A NAME="551"></A>of the herd?
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What do you mean?
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I mean to say that merchants husbandmen, providers 
<A NAME="554"></A>of food, and also training-masters and physicians, will all contend with 
<A NAME="555"></A>the herdsmen of humanity, whom we call Statesmen, declaring that they themselves 
<A NAME="556"></A>have the care of rearing of managing mankind, and that they rear not only 
<A NAME="557"></A>the common herd, but also the rulers themselves.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Are they not right in saying 
<A NAME="559"></A>so?
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Very likely they may be, and we will consider their 
<A NAME="561"></A>claim. But we are certain of this,-that no one will raise a similar claim 
<A NAME="562"></A>as against the herdsman, who is allowed on all hands to be the sole and 
<A NAME="563"></A>only feeder and physician of his herd; he is also their matchmaker and 
<A NAME="564"></A>accoucheur; no one else knows that department of science. And he is their 
<A NAME="565"></A>merry-maker and musician, as far as their nature is susceptible of such 
<A NAME="566"></A>influences, and no one can console and soothe his own herd better than 
<A NAME="567"></A>he can, either with the natural tones of his voice or with instruments. 
<A NAME="568"></A>And the same may be said of tenders of animals in general.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very true.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But if this is as you say, can our argument about the 
<A NAME="571"></A>king be true and unimpeachable? Were we right in selecting him out of ten 
<A NAME="572"></A>thousand other claimants to be the shepherd and rearer of the human 
<A NAME="573"></A>flock?
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Surely not.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Had we not reason just to now apprehend, that although 
<A NAME="576"></A>we may have described a sort of royal form, we have not as yet accurately 
<A NAME="577"></A>worked out the true image of the Statesman? and that we cannot reveal him 
<A NAME="578"></A>as he truly is in his own nature, until we have disengaged and separated 
<A NAME="579"></A>him from those who bang about him and claim to share in his 
<A NAME="580"></A>prerogatives?
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very true.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And that, Socrates, is what we must do, if we do not 
<A NAME="583"></A>mean to bring disgrace upon the argument at its close.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. We must certainly avoid that.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then let us make a new beginning, and travel by a different 
<A NAME="586"></A>road.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What road?
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I think that we may have a little amusement; there 
<A NAME="589"></A>is a famous tale, of which a good portion may with advantage be interwoven, 
<A NAME="590"></A>and then we may resume our series of divisions, and proceed in the old 
<A NAME="591"></A>path until we arrive at the desired summit. Shall we do as I 
<A NAME="592"></A>say?
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. By all means.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Listen, then, to a tale which a child would love to 
<A NAME="595"></A>hear; and you are not too old for childish amusement.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Let me hear.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There did really happen, and will again happen, like 
<A NAME="598"></A>many other events of which ancient tradition has preserved the record, 
<A NAME="599"></A>the portent which is traditionally said to have occurred in the quarrel 
<A NAME="600"></A>of Atreus and Thyestes. You have heard no doubt, and remember what they 
<A NAME="601"></A>say happened at that time?
<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. I suppose you to mean the token of the birth of 
<A NAME="603"></A>the golden lamb.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> No, not that; but another part of the story, which 
<A NAME="605"></A>tells how the sun and the stars once rose in the west, and set in the east, 
<A NAME="606"></A>and that the god reversed their motion, and gave them that which they now 
<A NAME="607"></A>have as a testimony to the right of Atreus.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes; there is that legend also.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Again, we have been often told of the reign of 
<A NAME="610"></A>Cronos.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes, very often.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Did you ever hear that the men of former times were 
<A NAME="613"></A>earthborn, and not begotten of one another?
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes, that is another old tradition.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> All these stories, and ten thousand others which are 
<A NAME="616"></A>still more wonderful, have a common origin; many of them have been lost 
<A NAME="617"></A>in the lapse of ages, or are repeated only in a disconnected form; but 
<A NAME="618"></A>the origin of them is what no one has told, and may as well be told now; 
<A NAME="619"></A>for the tale is suited to throw light on the nature of the 
<A NAME="620"></A>king.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very good; and I hope that you will give the whole 
<A NAME="622"></A>story, and leave out nothing.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Listen, then. There is a time when God himself guides 
<A NAME="624"></A>and helps to roll the world in its course; and there is a time, on the 
<A NAME="625"></A>completion of a certain cycle, when he lets go, and the world being a living 
<A NAME="626"></A>creature, and having originally received intelligence from its author and 
<A NAME="627"></A>creator turns about and by an inherent necessity revolves in the opposite 
<A NAME="628"></A>direction.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Why is that?
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Why, because only the most divine things of all remain 
<A NAME="631"></A>ever unchanged and the same, and body is not included in this class. Heaven 
<A NAME="632"></A>and the universe, as we have termed them, although they have been endowed 
<A NAME="633"></A>by the Creator with many glories, partake of a bodily nature, and therefore 
<A NAME="634"></A>cannot be entirely free from perturbation. But their motion is, as far 
<A NAME="635"></A>as possible, single and in the same place, and of the same kind; and is 
<A NAME="636"></A>therefore only subject to a reversal, which is the least alteration possible. 
<A NAME="637"></A>For the lord of all moving things is alone able to move of himself; and 
<A NAME="638"></A>to think that he moves them at one time in one direction and at another 
<A NAME="639"></A>time in another is blasphemy. Hence we must not say that the world is either 
<A NAME="640"></A>self-moved always, or all made to go round by God in two opposite courses; 
<A NAME="641"></A>or that two Gods, having opposite purposes, make it move round. But as 
<A NAME="642"></A>I have already said (and this is the only remaining alternative) the world 
<A NAME="643"></A>is guided at one time by an external power which is divine and receives 
<A NAME="644"></A>fresh life and immortality from the renewing hand of the Creator, and again, 
<A NAME="645"></A>when let go, moves spontaneously, being set free at such a time as to have, 
<A NAME="646"></A>during infinite cycles of years, a reverse movement: this is due to its 
<A NAME="647"></A>perfect balance, to its vast size, and to the fact that it turns on the 
<A NAME="648"></A>smallest pivot.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Your account of the world seems to be very reasonable 
<A NAME="650"></A>indeed.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Let us now reflect and try to gather from what has 
<A NAME="652"></A>been said the nature of the phenomenon which we affirmed to be the cause 
<A NAME="653"></A>of all these wonders. It is this.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What?
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The reversal which takes place from time to time of 
<A NAME="656"></A>the motion of the universe.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. How is that the cause?
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Of all changes of the heavenly motions, we may consider 
<A NAME="659"></A>this to be the greatest and most complete.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. I should imagine so.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And it may be supposed to result in the greatest changes 
<A NAME="662"></A>to the human beings who are the inhabitants of the world at the 
<A NAME="663"></A>time.
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Such changes would naturally 
<A NAME="665"></A>occur.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And animals, as we know, survive with difficulty great 
<A NAME="667"></A>and serious changes of many different kinds when they come upon them at 
<A NAME="668"></A>once.
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very true.
<A NAME="670"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Hence there necessarily occurs a great destruction 
<A NAME="671"></A>of them, which extends also to-the life of man; few survivors of the race 
<A NAME="672"></A>are left, and those who remain become the subjects of several novel and 
<A NAME="673"></A>remarkable phenomena, and of one in particular, which takes place at the 
<A NAME="674"></A>time when the transition is made to the cycle opposite to that in which 
<A NAME="675"></A>we are now living.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What is it?
<A NAME="677"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The life of all animals first came to a standstill, 
<A NAME="678"></A>and the mortal nature ceased to be or look older, and was then reversed 
<A NAME="679"></A>and grew young and delicate; the white locks of the aged darkened again, 
<A NAME="680"></A>and the cheeks the bearded man became smooth, and recovered their former 
<A NAME="681"></A>bloom; the bodies of youths in their prime grew softer and smaller, continually 
<A NAME="682"></A>by day and night returning and becoming assimilated to the nature of a 
<A NAME="683"></A>newly-born child in mind as well as body; in the succeeding stage they 
<A NAME="684"></A>wasted away and wholly disappeared. And the bodies of those who died by 
<A NAME="685"></A>violence at that time quickly passed through the like changes, and in a 
<A NAME="686"></A>few days were no more seen.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Then how, Stranger, were the animals created in 
<A NAME="688"></A>those days; and in what way were they begotten of one 
<A NAME="689"></A>another?
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> It is evident, Socrates, that there was no such thing 
<A NAME="691"></A>in the then order of nature as the procreation of animals from one another; 
<A NAME="692"></A>the earth-born race, of which we hear in story, was the one which existed 
<A NAME="693"></A>in those days-they rose again from the ground; and of this tradition, which 
<A NAME="694"></A>is now-a-days often unduly discredited, our ancestors, who were nearest 
<A NAME="695"></A>in point of time to the end of the last period and came into being at the 
<A NAME="696"></A>beginning of this, are to us the heralds. And mark how consistent the sequel 
<A NAME="697"></A>of the tale is; after the return of age to youth, follows the return of 
<A NAME="698"></A>the dead, who are lying in the earth, to life; simultaneously with the 
<A NAME="699"></A>reversal of the world the wheel of their generation has been turned back, 
<A NAME="700"></A>and they are put together and rise and live in the opposite order, unless 
<A NAME="701"></A>God has carried any of them away to some other lot. According to this tradition 
<A NAME="702"></A>they of necessity sprang from the earth and have the name of earth-born, 
<A NAME="703"></A>and so the above legend clings to them.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly that is quite consistent with what has 
<A NAME="705"></A>preceded; but tell me, was the life which you said existed in the reign 
<A NAME="706"></A>of Cronos in that cycle of the world, or in this? For the change in the 
<A NAME="707"></A>course of the stars and the sun must have occurred in 
<A NAME="708"></A>both.
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I see that you enter into my meaning;-no, that blessed 
<A NAME="710"></A>and spontaneous life does not belong to the present cycle of the world, 
<A NAME="711"></A>but to the previous one, in which God superintended the whole revolution 
<A NAME="712"></A>of the universe; and the several parts the universe were distributed under 
<A NAME="713"></A>the rule. certain inferior deities, as is the way in some places still 
<A NAME="714"></A>There were demigods, who were the shepherds of the various species and 
<A NAME="715"></A>herds of animals, and each one was in all respects sufficient for those 
<A NAME="716"></A>of whom he was the shepherd; neither was there any violence, or devouring 
<A NAME="717"></A>of one another or war or quarrel among them; and I might tell of ten thousand 
<A NAME="718"></A>other blessings, which belonged to that dispensation. The reason why the 
<A NAME="719"></A>life of man was, as tradition says, spontaneous, is as follows: In those 
<A NAME="720"></A>days God himself was their shepherd, and ruled over them, just as man, 
<A NAME="721"></A>over them, who is by comparison a divine being, still rules over the lower 
<A NAME="722"></A>animals. Under him there were no forms of government or separate possession 
<A NAME="723"></A>of women and children; for all men rose again from the earth, having no 
<A NAME="724"></A>memory, of the past. And although they had nothing of this sort, the earth 
<A NAME="725"></A>gave them fruits in abundance, which grew on trees and shrubs unbidden, 
<A NAME="726"></A>and were not planted by the hand of man. And they dwelt naked, and mostly 
<A NAME="727"></A>in the open air, for the temperature of their seasons, was mild; and they 
<A NAME="728"></A>had no beds, but lay on Soft couches of grass, which grew plentifully out 
<A NAME="729"></A>of: the earth. Such was the life of man in the days of Cronos, Socrates; 
<A NAME="730"></A>the character of our present life which is said to be under Zeus, you know 
<A NAME="731"></A>from your own experience. Can you, and will you, determine which of them 
<A NAME="732"></A>you deem the happier?
<A NAME="733"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Impossible.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then shall I determine for you as well as I 
<A NAME="735"></A>can?
<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. By all means.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Suppose that the nurslings of Cronos, having this boundless 
<A NAME="738"></A>leisure, and the power of holding intercourse, not only with men, but with 
<A NAME="739"></A>the brute creation, had used all these advantages with a view to philosophy, 
<A NAME="740"></A>conversing with the brutes as well as with one another, and learning of 
<A NAME="741"></A>every nature which was gifted with any special power, and was able to contribute 
<A NAME="742"></A>some special experience to the store of wisdom there would be no difficulty 
<A NAME="743"></A>in deciding that they would be a thousand times happier than the men of 
<A NAME="744"></A>our own day. Or, again, if they had merely eaten and drunk until they were 
<A NAME="745"></A>full, and told stories to one another and to the animals-such stories as 
<A NAME="746"></A>are now attributed to them-in this case also, as I should imagine, the 
<A NAME="747"></A>answer would be easy. But until some satisfactory witness can be found 
<A NAME="748"></A>of the love of that age for knowledge and: discussion, we had better let 
<A NAME="749"></A>the matter drop, and give the reason why we have unearthed this tale, and 
<A NAME="750"></A>then we shall be able to get on.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR>In the fulness of time, when the change was to take place, and 
<A NAME="752"></A>the earth-born race had all perished, and every soul had completed its 
<A NAME="753"></A>proper cycle of births and been sown in the earth her appointed number 
<A NAME="754"></A>of times, the pilot of the universe let the helm go, and retired to his 
<A NAME="755"></A>place of view; and then Fate and innate desire reversed the motion of the 
<A NAME="756"></A>world. Then also all the inferior deities who share the rule of the supreme 
<A NAME="757"></A>power, being informed of what was happening, let go the parts of the world 
<A NAME="758"></A>which were under their control. And the world turning round with a sudden 
<A NAME="759"></A>shock, being impelled in an opposite direction from beginning to end, was 
<A NAME="760"></A>shaken by a mighty earthquake, which wrought a new destruction of all manner 
<A NAME="761"></A>of animals. Afterwards, when sufficient time had elapsed, the tumult and 
<A NAME="762"></A>confusion and earthquake ceased, and the universal creature, once more 
<A NAME="763"></A>at peace attained to a calm, and settle down into his own orderly and accustomed 
<A NAME="764"></A>course, having the charge and rule of himself and of all the creatures 
<A NAME="765"></A>which are contained in him, and executing, as far as he remembered them, 
<A NAME="766"></A>the instructions of his Father and Creator, more precisely at first, but 
<A NAME="767"></A>afterwords with less exactness. The reason of the falling off was the admixture 
<A NAME="768"></A>of matter in him; this was inherent in the primal nature, which was full 
<A NAME="769"></A>of disorder, until attaining to the present order. From God, the constructor; 
<A NAME="770"></A>the world received all that is good in him, but from a previous state came 
<A NAME="771"></A>elements of evil and unrighteousness, which, thence derived, first of all 
<A NAME="772"></A>passed into the world, and were then transmitted to the animals. While 
<A NAME="773"></A>the world was aided by the pilot in nurturing the animals, the evil was 
<A NAME="774"></A>small, and great the good which he produced, but after the separation, 
<A NAME="775"></A>when the world was let go, at first all proceeded well enough; but, as 
<A NAME="776"></A>time went there was more and more forgetting, and the old discord again 
<A NAME="777"></A>held sway and burst forth in full glory; and at last small was the good, 
<A NAME="778"></A>and great was the admixture of evil, and there was a danger of universal 
<A NAME="779"></A>ruin to the world, and the things contained in him. Wherefore God, the 
<A NAME="780"></A>orderer of all, in his tender care, seeing that the world was in great 
<A NAME="781"></A>straits, and fearing that all might be dissolved in the storm and disappear 
<A NAME="782"></A>in infinite chaos, again seated himself at the helm; and bringing back 
<A NAME="783"></A>the elements which had fallen into dissolution and disorder to the motion 
<A NAME="784"></A>which had prevailed under his dispensation, he set them in order and restored 
<A NAME="785"></A>them, and made the world imperishable and immortal.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR><BR>And this is the whole tale, of which the first part will suffice 
<A NAME="787"></A>to illustrate the nature of the king. For when the world turned towards 
<A NAME="788"></A>the present cycle of generation, the age of man again stood still, and 
<A NAME="789"></A>a change opposite to the previous one was the result. The small creatures 
<A NAME="790"></A>which had almost disappeared grew in and stature, and the newly-born children 
<A NAME="791"></A>of the earth became grey and died and sank into the earth again. All things 
<A NAME="792"></A>changed, imitating and following the condition of the universe, and of 
<A NAME="793"></A>necessity agreeing with that in their mode of conception and generation 
<A NAME="794"></A>and nurture; for no animal; was any longer allowed to come into being in 
<A NAME="795"></A>the earth through the agency of other creative beings, but as the world 
<A NAME="796"></A>was ordained to be the lord of his own progress, in like manner the parts 
<A NAME="797"></A>were ordained to grow and generate and give nourishment, as far as they 
<A NAME="798"></A>could, of themselves, impelled by a similar movement. And so we have arrived 
<A NAME="799"></A>at the real end of this discourse; for although there might be much to 
<A NAME="800"></A>tell of the lower animals, and of the condition out of which they changed 
<A NAME="801"></A>and of the causes of the change, about men there is not much, and that 
<A NAME="802"></A>little is more to the purpose. Deprived of the care of God, who had possessed 
<A NAME="803"></A>and tended them, they were left helpless and defenceless, and were torn 
<A NAME="804"></A>in pieces by the beasts, who were naturally fierce and had now grown wild. 
<A NAME="805"></A>And in the first ages they were still without skill or resource; the food 
<A NAME="806"></A>which once grew spontaneously had failed, and as yet they knew not how 
<A NAME="807"></A>to procure it, because they-had never felt the pressure of necessity. For 
<A NAME="808"></A>all these reasons they were in a great strait; wherefore also the gifts 
<A NAME="809"></A>spoken of in the old tradition were imparted to man by the gods, together 
<A NAME="810"></A>with so much teaching and education as was indispensable; fire was given 
<A NAME="811"></A>to them by Prometheus, the arts by Hephaestus and his fellow-worker, Athene, 
<A NAME="812"></A>seeds and plants by others. From these is derived all that has helped to 
<A NAME="813"></A>frame human life; since the care of the Gods, as I was saying, had now 
<A NAME="814"></A>failed men, and they had to order their course of life for themselves, 
<A NAME="815"></A>and were their own masters, just like the universal creature whom they 
<A NAME="816"></A>imitate and follow, ever changing, as he changes, and ever living and growing, 
<A NAME="817"></A>at one time in one manner, and at another time in another. Enough of the 
<A NAME="818"></A>story, which may be of use in showing us how greatly we erred in the delineation 
<A NAME="819"></A>of the king and the statesman in our previous discourse.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What was this great error of which you 
<A NAME="821"></A>speak?
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There were two; the first a lesser one, the other was 
<A NAME="823"></A>an error on a much larger and grander scale.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What do you mean?
<A NAME="825"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I mean to say that when we were asked about a king 
<A NAME="826"></A>and statesman of the present; and generation, we told of a shepherd of 
<A NAME="827"></A>a human flock who belonged to the other cycle, and of one who was a god 
<A NAME="828"></A>when he ought to have been a man; and this a great error. Again, we declared 
<A NAME="829"></A>him to be, the ruler of the entire State, without, explaining how: this 
<A NAME="830"></A>was not the whole truth, nor very intelligible; but still it was true, 
<A NAME="831"></A>and therefore the second error was not so, great as the 
<A NAME="832"></A>first.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR><BR>Y Soc. Very good.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Before we can expect to have a perfect description 
<A NAME="835"></A>of the statesman we must define the nature of his office.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And the myth was introduced in order to show, not only 
<A NAME="838"></A>that all others are rivals of true shepherd who is the object of our search, 
<A NAME="839"></A>but in order that we might have a clearer view of him who is alone worthy 
<A NAME="840"></A>to receive this appellation, because, he alone of shepherds and herdsmen, 
<A NAME="841"></A>according to the image which we have employed, has the care of human 
<A NAME="842"></A>beings.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very true.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And I cannot help thinking, Socrates, that the form 
<A NAME="845"></A>of the divine shepherd is even higher than that of a king; whereas the 
<A NAME="846"></A>statesmen who are now on earth seem to be much more like their subjects 
<A NAME="847"></A>in character, and which more nearly to partake of their breeding and 
<A NAME="848"></A>education.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Still they must be investigated all the same, to see 
<A NAME="851"></A>whether, like the divine shepherd, they are above their subjects or on 
<A NAME="852"></A>a level with them.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Of course.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> To resume:-Do you remember that we spoke of a command-for-self 
<A NAME="855"></A>exercised over animals, not singly but collectively, which we called the 
<A NAME="856"></A>art of rearing a herd?
<A NAME="857"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes, I remember.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There, somewhere, lay our error; for we never included 
<A NAME="859"></A>or mentioned the Statesman; and we did not observe that he had no place 
<A NAME="860"></A>in our nomenclature.
<A NAME="861"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. How was that?
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> All other herdsmen "rear" their herds, but this is 
<A NAME="863"></A>not a suitable term to apply to the Statesman; we should use a name which 
<A NAME="864"></A>is common to them all.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. True, if there be such a name.
<A NAME="866"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Why, is not "care" of herds applicable to all? For 
<A NAME="867"></A>this implies no feeding, or any special duty; if we say either "tending" 
<A NAME="868"></A>the herds, or "managing" the herds, or "having the care" of them, the same 
<A NAME="869"></A>word will include all, and then we may wrap up the Statesman with the rest, 
<A NAME="870"></A>as the argument seems to require.
<A NAME="871"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Quite right; but how shall we take the-next step 
<A NAME="872"></A>in the division?
<A NAME="873"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> As before we divided the art of "rearing" herds accordingly 
<A NAME="874"></A>as they were land or water herds, winged and wingless, mixing or not mixing 
<A NAME="875"></A>the breed, horned and hornless, so we may divide by these same differences 
<A NAME="876"></A>the "teading" of herds, comprehending in our definition the kingship of 
<A NAME="877"></A>to-day and the rule of Cronos.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. That is clear; but I still ask, what is to 
<A NAME="879"></A>follow.
<A NAME="880"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> If the word had been "managing" herds, instead of feeding 
<A NAME="881"></A>or rearing them, no one would have argued that there was no care of men 
<A NAME="882"></A>in the case of the politician, although it was justly contended, that there 
<A NAME="883"></A>was no human art of feeding them which was worthy of the name, or at least, 
<A NAME="884"></A>if there were, many a man had a prior and greater right to share in such 
<A NAME="885"></A>an art than any king.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. True.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But no other art or science will have a prior or better 
<A NAME="888"></A>right than the royal science to care for human society and to rule over 
<A NAME="889"></A>men in general.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Quite true.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> In the next place, Socrates, we must surely notice 
<A NAME="892"></A>that a great error was committed at the end of our analysis.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What was it?
<A NAME="894"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Why, supposing we were ever so sure that there is such 
<A NAME="895"></A>an art as the art of rearing or feeding bipeds, there was no reason why 
<A NAME="896"></A>we should call this the royal or political art, as though there were no 
<A NAME="897"></A>more to be said.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly not.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Our first duty, as we were saying, was to remodel the 
<A NAME="900"></A>name, so as to have the notion of care rather than of feeding, and then 
<A NAME="901"></A>to divide, for there may be still considerable divisions.
<A NAME="902"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. How can they be made?
<A NAME="903"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> First, by separating the divine shepherd from the human 
<A NAME="904"></A>guardian or manager.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. True.
<A NAME="906"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And the art of management which is assigned to man 
<A NAME="907"></A>would again have to be subdivided.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. On what principle?
<A NAME="909"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> On the principle of voluntary and 
<A NAME="910"></A>compulsory.
<A NAME="911"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Why?
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Because, if I am not mistaken, there has been an error 
<A NAME="913"></A>here; for our simplicity led us to rank king and tyrant together, whereas 
<A NAME="914"></A>they are utterly distinct, like their modes of government.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. True.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then, now, as I said, let us make the correction and 
<A NAME="917"></A>divide human care into two parts, on the principle of voluntary and 
<A NAME="918"></A>compulsory.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly.
<A NAME="920"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And if we call the management of violent rulers tyranny, 
<A NAME="921"></A>and the voluntary management of herds of voluntary bipeds politics, may 
<A NAME="922"></A>we not further assert that he who has this latter art of management is 
<A NAME="923"></A>the true king and statesman?
<A NAME="924"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. I think, Stranger, that we have now completed the 
<A NAME="925"></A>account of the Statesman.
<A NAME="926"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Would that we had Socrates, but I have to satisfy myself 
<A NAME="927"></A>as well as you; and in my judgment the figure of the king is not yet perfected; 
<A NAME="928"></A>like statuaries who, in their too great haste, having overdone the several 
<A NAME="929"></A>parts of their work, lose time in cutting them down, so too we, partly 
<A NAME="930"></A>out of haste, partly out of haste, partly out of a magnanimous desire to 
<A NAME="931"></A>expose our former error, and also because we imagined that a king required 
<A NAME="932"></A>grand illustrations, have taken up a marvellous lump of fable, and have 
<A NAME="933"></A>been obliged to use more than was necessary. This made us discourse at 
<A NAME="934"></A>large, and, nevertheless, the story never came to an end. And our discussion 
<A NAME="935"></A>might be compared to a picture of some living being which had been fairly 
<A NAME="936"></A>drawn in outline, but had not yet attained the life and clearness which 
<A NAME="937"></A>is given by the blending of colours. Now to intelligent persons a living 
<A NAME="938"></A>being had better be delineated by language and discourse than by any painting 
<A NAME="939"></A>or work of art: to the duller sort by works of art.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very true; but what is the imperfection which still 
<A NAME="941"></A>remains? I wish that you would tell me.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The higher ideas, my dear friend, can hardly be set 
<A NAME="943"></A>forth except through the medium of examples; every man seems to know all 
<A NAME="944"></A>things in a dreamy sort of way, and then again to wake up and to know 
<A NAME="945"></A>nothing.
<A NAME="946"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What do you mean?
<A NAME="947"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I fear that I have been unfortunate in raising a question 
<A NAME="948"></A>about our experience of knowledge.
<A NAME="949"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Why so?
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Why, because my "example" requires the assistance of 
<A NAME="951"></A>another example.
<A NAME="952"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Proceed; you need not fear that I shall 
<A NAME="953"></A>tire.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I will proceed, finding, as I do, such a ready listener 
<A NAME="955"></A>in you: when children are beginning to know their letters-
<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What are you going to say?
<A NAME="957"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> That they distinguish the several letters well enough 
<A NAME="958"></A>in very short and easy syllables, and are able to tell them 
<A NAME="959"></A>correctly.
<A NAME="960"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Whereas in other syllables they do not recognize them, 
<A NAME="962"></A>and think and speak falsely of them.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very true.
<A NAME="964"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Will not the best and easiest way of bringing them 
<A NAME="965"></A>to a knowledge of what they do not as yet know be-
<A NAME="966"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Be what?
<A NAME="967"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> To refer them first of all to cases in which they judge 
<A NAME="968"></A>correctly about the letters in question, and then to compare these with 
<A NAME="969"></A>the cases in which they do not as yet know, and to show them that the letters 
<A NAME="970"></A>are the same, and have the same character in both combination, until all 
<A NAME="971"></A>cases in which they are right have been Placed side by side with all cases 
<A NAME="972"></A>in which they are wrong. In this way they have examples, and are made to 
<A NAME="973"></A>learn that each letter in every combination is always the same and not 
<A NAME="974"></A>another, and is always called by the same name.
<A NAME="975"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly.
<A NAME="976"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Are not examples formed in this manner? We take a thing 
<A NAME="977"></A>and compare it with another distinct instance of the same thing, of which 
<A NAME="978"></A>we have a right conception, and out of the comparison there arises one 
<A NAME="979"></A>true notion, which includes both of them.
<A NAME="980"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Exactly.
<A NAME="981"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Can we wonder, then, that the soul has the same uncertainty 
<A NAME="982"></A>about the alphabet of things, and sometimes and in some cases is firmly 
<A NAME="983"></A>fixed by the truth in each particular, and then, again, in other cases 
<A NAME="984"></A>is altogether at sea; having somehow or other a correction of combinations; 
<A NAME="985"></A>but when the elements are transferred into the long and difficult language 
<A NAME="986"></A>(syllables) of facts, is again ignorant of them?
<A NAME="987"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. There is nothing wonderful in 
<A NAME="988"></A>that.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Could any one, my friend, who began with false opinion 
<A NAME="990"></A>ever expect to arrive even at a small portion of truth and to attain 
<A NAME="991"></A>wisdom?
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Hardly.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then you and I will not be far wrong in trying to see 
<A NAME="994"></A>the nature of example in general in a small and particular instance; afterwards 
<A NAME="995"></A>from lesser things we intend to pass to the royal class, which is the highest 
<A NAME="996"></A>form of the same nature, and endeavour to discover by rules of art what 
<A NAME="997"></A>the management of cities is; and then the dream will become a reality to 
<A NAME="998"></A>us.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very true.
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then, once more, let us resume the previous argument, 
<A NAME="1001"></A>and as there were innumerable rivals of the royal race who claim to have 
<A NAME="1002"></A>the care of states, let us part them all off, and leave him alone; and, 
<A NAME="1003"></A>as I was saying, a model or example of this process has first to be 
<A NAME="1004"></A>framed.
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Exactly.
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> What model is there which is small, and yet has any 
<A NAME="1007"></A>analogy with the political occupation? Suppose, Socrates, that if we have 
<A NAME="1008"></A>no other example at hand, we choose weaving, or, more precisely, weaving 
<A NAME="1009"></A>of wool-this will be quite enough, without taking the whole of weaving, 
<A NAME="1010"></A>to illustrate our meaning?
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly.
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Why should we not apply to weaving the same processes 
<A NAME="1013"></A>of division and subdivision which we have already applied to other classes; 
<A NAME="1014"></A>going once more as rapidly as we can through all the steps until we come 
<A NAME="1015"></A>to that which is needed for our purpose?
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. How do you mean?
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I shall reply by actually performing the 
<A NAME="1018"></A>process.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very good.
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> All things which we make or acquire are either creative 
<A NAME="1021"></A>or preventive; of the preventive class are antidotes, divine and human, 
<A NAME="1022"></A>and also defences; and defences are either military weapons or protections; 
<A NAME="1023"></A>and protections are veils, and also shields against heat and cold, and 
<A NAME="1024"></A>shields against heat and cold are shelters and coverings; and coverings 
<A NAME="1025"></A>are blankets and garments; and garments are some of them in one piece, 
<A NAME="1026"></A>and others of them are made in several parts; and of these latter some 
<A NAME="1027"></A>are stitched, others are fastened and not stitched; and of the not stitched, 
<A NAME="1028"></A>some are made of the sinews of plants, and some of hair; and of these, 
<A NAME="1029"></A>again, some are cemented with water and earth, and others are fastened 
<A NAME="1030"></A>together by themselves. And these last defences and coverings which are 
<A NAME="1031"></A>fastened together by themselves are called clothes, and the art which superintends 
<A NAME="1032"></A>them we may call, from the nature of the operation, the art of clothing, 
<A NAME="1033"></A>just as before the art of the Statesman was derived from the State; and 
<A NAME="1034"></A>may we not say that the art of weaving, at least that largest portion of 
<A NAME="1035"></A>it which was concerned with the making of clothes, differs only in name 
<A NAME="1036"></A>from this art of clothing, in the same way that, in the previous case, 
<A NAME="1037"></A>the royal science differed from the political?
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Most true.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> In the next place, let us make the reflection, that 
<A NAME="1040"></A>the art of weaving clothes, which an incompetent person might fancy to 
<A NAME="1041"></A>have been sufficiently described, has been separated off from several others 
<A NAME="1042"></A>which are of the same family, but not from the co-operative 
<A NAME="1043"></A>arts.
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. And which are the kindred arts?
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I see that I have not taken you with me. So I think 
<A NAME="1046"></A>that we had better go backwards, starting from the end. We just now parted 
<A NAME="1047"></A>off from the weaving of clothes, the making of blankets, which differ from 
<A NAME="1048"></A>each other in that one is put under and the other is put around! and these 
<A NAME="1049"></A>are what I termed kindred arts.
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. I understand.
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And we have subtracted the manufacture of all articles 
<A NAME="1052"></A>made of flax and cords, and all that we just now metaphorically termed 
<A NAME="1053"></A>the sinews of plants, and we have also separated off the process of felting 
<A NAME="1054"></A>and the putting together of materials by stitching and sewing, of which 
<A NAME="1055"></A>the most important part is the cobbler's art.
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Precisely.
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then we separated off the currier's art, which prepared 
<A NAME="1058"></A>coverings in entire pieces, and the art of sheltering, and subtracted the 
<A NAME="1059"></A>various arts of making water-tight which are employed in building, and 
<A NAME="1060"></A>in general in carpentering, and in other crafts, and all such arts as furnish 
<A NAME="1061"></A>impediments to thieving and acts of violence, and are concerned with making 
<A NAME="1062"></A>the lids of boxes and the fixing of doors, being divisions of the art of 
<A NAME="1063"></A>joining; and we also cut off the manufacture of arms, which is a section 
<A NAME="1064"></A>of the great and manifold art of making defences; and we originally began 
<A NAME="1065"></A>by parting off the whole of the magic art which is concerned with antidoter, 
<A NAME="1066"></A>and have left, as would appear, the very art of which we were in search, 
<A NAME="1067"></A>the art of protection against winter cold, which fabricates woollen defences, 
<A NAME="1068"></A>and has the name of weaving.
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very true.
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Yes, my boy, but that is not all; for the first process 
<A NAME="1071"></A>to which the material is subjected is the opposite of 
<A NAME="1072"></A>weaving.
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. How so?
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Weaving is a sort of uniting?
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But the first process is a separation of the clotted 
<A NAME="1077"></A>and matted fibres?
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What do you mean?
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> I mean the work of the carder's art; for we cannot 
<A NAME="1080"></A>say that carding is weaving, or that the carder is a 
<A NAME="1081"></A>weaver.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly not.
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Again, if a person were to say that the art of making 
<A NAME="1084"></A>the warp and the woof was the art of weaving, he would say what was paradoxical 
<A NAME="1085"></A>and false.
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. To be sure.
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Shall we say that the whole art of the fuller or of 
<A NAME="1088"></A>the mender has nothing to do with the care and treatment clotes, or are 
<A NAME="1089"></A>we to regard all these as arts of weaving?
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly not.
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And yet surely all these arts will maintain that they 
<A NAME="1092"></A>are concerned with the treatment and production of clothes; they will dispute 
<A NAME="1093"></A>the exclusive prerogative of weaving, and though assigning a larger sphere 
<A NAME="1094"></A>to that, will still reserve a considerable field for 
<A NAME="1095"></A>themselves.
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very true.
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Besides these, there are the arts which make tools 
<A NAME="1098"></A>and instruments of weaving, and which will claim at least to be cooperative 
<A NAME="1099"></A>causes in every work of the weaver.
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Most true.
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Well, then, suppose that we define weaving, or rather 
<A NAME="1102"></A>that part of it which has been selected by us, to be the greatest and noblest 
<A NAME="1103"></A>of arts which are concerned with woollen garments-shall we be right? Is 
<A NAME="1104"></A>not the definition, although true, wanting in clearness and completeness; 
<A NAME="1105"></A>for do not all those other arts require to be first cleared 
<A NAME="1106"></A>away?
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. True.
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then the next thing will be to separate them, in order 
<A NAME="1109"></A>that the argument may proceed in a regular manner?
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. By all means.
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Let us consider, in the first place, that there are 
<A NAME="1112"></A>two kinds of arts entering into everything which we 
<A NAME="1113"></A>do.
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What are they?
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The one kind is the conditional or cooperative, the 
<A NAME="1116"></A>other the principal cause.
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What do you mean?
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The arts which do not manufacture the actual thing, 
<A NAME="1119"></A>but which furnish the necessary tools for the manufacture, without which 
<A NAME="1120"></A>the several arts could not fulfil their appointed work, are co-operative; 
<A NAME="1121"></A>but those which make the things themselves are causal.
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. A very reasonable distinction.
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Thus the arts which make spindles, combs, and other 
<A NAME="1124"></A>instruments of the production of clothes may be called co-operative, and 
<A NAME="1125"></A>those which treat and fabricate the things themselves, 
<A NAME="1126"></A>causal.
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very true.
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The arts of washing and mending, and the other preparatory 
<A NAME="1129"></A>arts which belong to the causal class, and form a division of the great 
<A NAME="1130"></A>art of adornment, may be all comprehended under what we call the fuller's 
<A NAME="1131"></A>art.
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very good.
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Carding and spinning threads and all the parts of the 
<A NAME="1134"></A>process which are concerned with the actual manufacture of a woollen garment 
<A NAME="1135"></A>form a single art, which is one of thow universally acknowledged-the art 
<A NAME="1136"></A>of working in wool.
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. To be sure.
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Of working in wool again, there are two divisions, 
<A NAME="1139"></A>and both these are parts of two arts at once.
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. How is that?
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Carding and one half of the use of the comb, and the 
<A NAME="1142"></A>other processes of wool-working which separate the composite, may be classed 
<A NAME="1143"></A>together as belonging both to the art of woolworking, and also to one of 
<A NAME="1144"></A>the two great arts which are of universal application-the art of composition 
<A NAME="1145"></A>and the art of division.
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes.
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> To the latter belong carding and the other processes 
<A NAME="1148"></A>of which I was just now speaking the art of discernment or division in 
<A NAME="1149"></A>wool and yarn, which is effected in one manner with the comb and in another 
<A NAME="1150"></A>with the hands, is variously described under all the names which I just 
<A NAME="1151"></A>now mentioned.
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very true.
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Again, let us take some process of woolworking which 
<A NAME="1154"></A>is also a portion of the art of composition, and, dismissing the elements 
<A NAME="1155"></A>of division which we found there, make two halves, one on the principle 
<A NAME="1156"></A>of composition, and the other on the principle of division.
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Let that be done.
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And once more, Socrates, we must divide the part which 
<A NAME="1159"></A>belongs at once both to woolworking and composition, if we are ever to 
<A NAME="1160"></A>discover satisfactorily the aforesaid art of weaving.
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. We must.
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Yes, certainly, and let us call one part of the art 
<A NAME="1163"></A>the art of twisting threads, the other the art of combining 
<A NAME="1164"></A>them.
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Do I understand you, in speaking of twisting, to 
<A NAME="1166"></A>be referring to manufacture of the warp?
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Yes, and of the woof too; how, if not by twisting, 
<A NAME="1168"></A>is the woof made?
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. There is no other way.
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then suppose that you define the warp and the woof, 
<A NAME="1171"></A>for I think that the definition will be of use to you.
<A NAME="1172"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. How shall I define them?
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> As thus: A piece of carded wool which is drawn out 
<A NAME="1174"></A>lengthwise and breadth-wise is said to be pulled out.
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes.
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And the wool thus prepared when twisted by the spindle, 
<A NAME="1177"></A>and made into a firm thread, is called the warp, And the art which regulates 
<A NAME="1178"></A>these operations the art of spinning the warp.
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. True.
<A NAME="1180"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And the threads which are more loosely spun, having 
<A NAME="1181"></A>a softness proportioned to the intertexture of the warp and to the degree 
<A NAME="1182"></A>of force used in dressing the cloth-the threads which are thus spun are 
<A NAME="1183"></A>called the woof, and the art which is set over them may be called the art 
<A NAME="1184"></A>of spinning the woof.
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very true.
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And, now, there can be no mistake about the nature 
<A NAME="1187"></A>of the part of weaving which we have undertaken to define. For when that 
<A NAME="1188"></A>part of the art of composition which is employed in the working of wool 
<A NAME="1189"></A>forms a web by the regular intertexture of warp and woof, the entire woven 
<A NAME="1190"></A>substance is called by us a woollen garment, and the art which presides 
<A NAME="1191"></A>over this is the art of weaving.
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very true.
<A NAME="1193"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But why did we not say at once that weaving is the 
<A NAME="1194"></A>art of entwining warp and woof, instead of making a long and useless 
<A NAME="1195"></A>circuit?
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. I thought, Stranger, that there was nothing useless 
<A NAME="1197"></A>in what was said.
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Very likely, but you may not always think so, my sweet 
<A NAME="1199"></A>friend; and in case any feeling of dissatisfaction should hereafter arise 
<A NAME="1200"></A>in your mind, as it very well may, let me lay down a principle which will 
<A NAME="1201"></A>apply to arguments in general.
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Proceed.
<A NAME="1203"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Let us begin by considering the whole nature of excess 
<A NAME="1204"></A>and defect, and then we shall have a rational ground on which we may praise 
<A NAME="1205"></A>or blame too much length or too much shortness in discussions of this 
<A NAME="1206"></A>kind.
<A NAME="1207"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Let us do so.
<A NAME="1208"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The points on which I think that we ought to dwell 
<A NAME="1209"></A>are the following:-
<A NAME="1210"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What?
<A NAME="1211"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Length and shortness, excess and defect; with all of 
<A NAME="1212"></A>these the art of measurement is conversant.
<A NAME="1213"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes.
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And the art of measurement has to be divided into two 
<A NAME="1215"></A>parts, with a view to our present purpose.
<A NAME="1216"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Where would you make the division?
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> As thus: I would make two parts, one having regard 
<A NAME="1218"></A>to the relativity of greatness and smallness to each other; and there is 
<A NAME="1219"></A>another, without which the existence of production would be 
<A NAME="1220"></A>impossible.
<A NAME="1221"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What do you mean?
<A NAME="1222"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Do you not think that it is only natural for the greater 
<A NAME="1223"></A>to be called greater with reference to the less alone, and the less reference 
<A NAME="1224"></A>to the greater alone?
<A NAME="1225"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes.
<A NAME="1226"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Well, but is there not also something exceeding and 
<A NAME="1227"></A>exceeded by the principle of the mean, both in speech and action, and is 
<A NAME="1228"></A>not this a reality, and the chief mark of difference between good and bad 
<A NAME="1229"></A>men?
<A NAME="1230"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Plainly.
<A NAME="1231"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Then we must suppose that the great and small exist 
<A NAME="1232"></A>and are discerned in both these ways, and not, as we were saying before, 
<A NAME="1233"></A>only relatively to one another, but there must also be another comparison 
<A NAME="1234"></A>of them with the mean or ideal standard; would you like to hear the reason 
<A NAME="1235"></A>why?
<A NAME="1236"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly.
<A NAME="1237"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> If we assume the greater to exist only in relation 
<A NAME="1238"></A>to the less, there will never be any comparison of either with the 
<A NAME="1239"></A>mean.
<A NAME="1240"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. True.
<A NAME="1241"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> And would not this doctrine be the ruin of all the 
<A NAME="1242"></A>arts and their creations; would not the art of the Statesman and the aforesaid 
<A NAME="1243"></A>art of weaving disappear? For all these arts are on the watch against excess 
<A NAME="1244"></A>and defect, not as unrealities, but as real evils, which occasion a difficulty 
<A NAME="1245"></A>in action; and the excellence of beauty of every work of art is due to 
<A NAME="1246"></A>this observance of measure.
<A NAME="1247"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Certainly.
<A NAME="1248"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But if the science of the Statesman disappears, the 
<A NAME="1249"></A>search for the royal science will be impossible.
<A NAME="1250"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Very true.
<A NAME="1251"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> Well, then, as in the case of the Sophist we extorted 
<A NAME="1252"></A>the inference that not-being had an existence, because here was the point 
<A NAME="1253"></A>at which the argument eluded our grasp, so in this we must endeavour to 
<A NAME="1254"></A>show that the greater and, less are not only to be measured with one another, 
<A NAME="1255"></A>but also have to do with the production of the mean; for if this is not 
<A NAME="1256"></A>admitted, neither a statesman nor any other man of action can be an undisputed 
<A NAME="1257"></A>master of his science.
<A NAME="1258"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Yes, we must certainly do again what we did 
<A NAME="1259"></A>then.
<A NAME="1260"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> But this, Socrates, is a greater work than the other, 
<A NAME="1261"></A>of which we only too well remember the length. I think, however, that we 
<A NAME="1262"></A>may fairly assume something of this sort-
<A NAME="1263"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. What?
<A NAME="1264"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> That we shall some day require this notion of a mean 
<A NAME="1265"></A>with a view to the demonstration of absolute truth; meanwhile, the argument 
<A NAME="1266"></A>that the very existence of the arts must be held to depend on the possibility 
<A NAME="1267"></A>of measuring more or less, not only with one another, but also with a view 
<A NAME="1268"></A>to the attainment of the mean, seems to afford a grand support and satisfactory 
<A NAME="1269"></A>proof of the doctrine which we are maintaining; for if there are arts, 
<A NAME="1270"></A>there is a standard of measure, and if there is a standard of measure, 
<A NAME="1271"></A>there are arts; but if either is wanting, there is neither.
<A NAME="1272"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. True; and what is the next step?
<A NAME="1273"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> The next step clearly is to divide the art of measurement 
<A NAME="1274"></A>into two parts, all we have said already, and to place in the one part 
<A NAME="1275"></A>all the arts which measure number, length, depth, breadth, swiftness with 
<A NAME="1276"></A>their opposites; and to have another part in which they are measured with 
<A NAME="1277"></A>the mean, and the fit, and the opportune, and the due, and with all those 
<A NAME="1278"></A>words, in short, which denote a mean or standard removed from the 
<A NAME="1279"></A>extremes.
<A NAME="1280"></A><BR><BR><B>Y.</B> Soc. Here are two vast divisions, embracing two very 
<A NAME="1281"></A>different spheres.
<A NAME="1282"></A><BR><BR><B>Str.</B> There are many accomplished men, Socrates, who say, 
<A NAME="1283"></A>believing themselves to speak wisely, that the art of measurement is universal, 
<A NAME="1284"></A>and has to do with all things. And this means what we are now saying; for 
<A NAME="1285"></A>all things which come within the province of art do certainly in some sense 
<A NAME="1286"></A>partake of measure. But these persons, because they are not accustomed 
<A NAME="1287"></A>to distinguish classes according to real forms, jumble together two widely 
<A NAME="1288"></A>different things, relation to one another, and to a standard, under the 
<A NAME="1289"></A>idea that they are the same, and also fall into the converse error of dividing 
<A NAME="1290"></A>other things not according to their real parts. Whereas the right way is, 
<A NAME="1291"></A>if a man has first seen the unity of things, to go on with the enquiry 
<A NAME="1292"></A>and not desist until he has found all the differences contained in it which 
<A NAME="1293"></A>form distinct classes; nor again should he be able to rest contented with 
<A NAME="1294"></A>the manifold diversities which are seen in a multitude of things until 
<A NAME="1295"></A>he has comprehended all of them that have any affinity within the bounds 
<A NAME="1296"></A>of one similarity and embraced them within the reality of a single kind. 
<A NAME="1297"></A>But we have said enough on
