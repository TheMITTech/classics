<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Athenian Stranger. And now, what will this city be? I do not mean to ask 
<A NAME="11"></A>what is or will hereafter be the name of the place; that may be determined 
<A NAME="12"></A>by the accident of locality or of the original settlement-a river or fountain, 
<A NAME="13"></A>or some local deity may give the sanction of a name to the newly-founded 
<A NAME="14"></A>city; but I do want to know what the situation is, whether maritime or 
<A NAME="15"></A>inland.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR><B>Cleinias.</B> I should imagine, Stranger, that the city of which 
<A NAME="17"></A>we are speaking is about eighty stadia distant from the 
<A NAME="18"></A>sea.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> And are there harbours on the seaboard?
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Excellent harbours, Stranger; there could not be 
<A NAME="21"></A>better.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Alas! what a prospect! And is the surrounding country productive, 
<A NAME="23"></A>or in need of importations?
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Hardly in need of anything.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And is there any neighbouring State?
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> None whatever, and that is the reason for selecting the 
<A NAME="27"></A>place; in days of old, there was a migration of the inhabitants, and the 
<A NAME="28"></A>region has been deserted from time immemorial.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> And has the place a fair proportion of hill, and plain, 
<A NAME="30"></A>and wood?
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Like the rest of Crete in that.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> You mean to say that there is more rock than 
<A NAME="33"></A>plain?
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Exactly.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then there is some hope that your citizens may be virtuous: 
<A NAME="36"></A>had you been on the sea, and well provided with harbours, and an importing 
<A NAME="37"></A>rather than a producing country, some mighty saviour would have been needed, 
<A NAME="38"></A>and lawgivers more than mortal, if you were ever to have a chance of preserving 
<A NAME="39"></A>your state from degeneracy and discordance of manners. But there is comfort 
<A NAME="40"></A>in the eighty stadia; although the sea is too near, especially if, as you 
<A NAME="41"></A>say, the harbours are so good. Still we may be content. The sea is pleasant 
<A NAME="42"></A>enough as a daily companion, but has indeed also a bitter and brackish 
<A NAME="43"></A>quality; filling the streets with merchants and shopkeepers, and begetting 
<A NAME="44"></A>in the souls of men uncertain and unfaithful ways-making the state unfriendly 
<A NAME="45"></A>and unfaithful both to her own citizens, and also to other nations. There 
<A NAME="46"></A>is a consolation, therefore, in the country producing all things at home; 
<A NAME="47"></A>and yet, owing to the ruggedness of the soil, not providing anything in 
<A NAME="48"></A>great abundance. Had there been abundance, there might have been a great 
<A NAME="49"></A>export trade, and a great return of gold and silver; which, as we may safely 
<A NAME="50"></A>affirm, has the most fatal results on a State whose aim is the attainment 
<A NAME="51"></A>of just and noble sentiments: this was said by us, if you remember, in 
<A NAME="52"></A>the previous discussion.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I remember, and am of opinion that we both were and 
<A NAME="54"></A>are in the right.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Well, but let me ask, how is the country supplied with 
<A NAME="56"></A>timber for ship-building?
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> There is no fir of any consequence, nor pine, and not 
<A NAME="58"></A>much cypress; and you will find very little stone-pine or plane-wood, which 
<A NAME="59"></A>shipwrights always require for the interior of ships.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> These are also natural advantages.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Why so?
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Because no city ought to be easily able to imitate its 
<A NAME="63"></A>enemies in what is mischievous.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How does that bear upon any of the matters of which 
<A NAME="65"></A>we have been speaking?
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Remember, my good friend, what I said at first about 
<A NAME="67"></A>the Cretan laws, that they look to one thing only, and this, as you both 
<A NAME="68"></A>agreed, was war; and I replied that such laws, in so far as they tended 
<A NAME="69"></A>to promote virtue, were good; but in that they regarded a part only, and 
<A NAME="70"></A>not the whole of virtue, I disapproved of them. And now I hope that you 
<A NAME="71"></A>in your turn will follow and watch me if I legislate with a view to anything 
<A NAME="72"></A>but virtue, or with a view to a part of virtue only. For I consider that 
<A NAME="73"></A>the true lawgiver, like an archer, aims only at that on which some eternal 
<A NAME="74"></A>beauty is always attending, and dismisses everything else, whether wealth 
<A NAME="75"></A>or any other benefit, when separated from virtue. I was saying that the 
<A NAME="76"></A>imitation of enemies was a bad thing; and I was thinking of a case in which 
<A NAME="77"></A>a maritime people are harassed by enemies, as the Athenians were by Minos 
<A NAME="78"></A>(I do not speak from any desire to recall past grievances); but he, as 
<A NAME="79"></A>we know, was a great naval potentate, who compelled the inhabitants of 
<A NAME="80"></A>Attica to pay him a cruel tribute; and in those days they had no ships 
<A NAME="81"></A>of war as they now have, nor was the country filled with ship-timber, and 
<A NAME="82"></A>therefore they could not readily build them. Hence they could not learn 
<A NAME="83"></A>how to imitate their enemy at sea, and in this way, becoming sailors themselves, 
<A NAME="84"></A>directly repel their enemies. Better for them to have lost many times over 
<A NAME="85"></A>the seven youths, than that heavy-armed and stationary troops should have 
<A NAME="86"></A>been turned into sailors, and accustomed to be often leaping on shore, 
<A NAME="87"></A>and again to come running back to their ships; or should have fancied that 
<A NAME="88"></A>there was no disgrace in not awaiting the attack of an enemy and dying 
<A NAME="89"></A>boldly; and that there were good reasons, and plenty of them, for a man 
<A NAME="90"></A>throwing away his arms, and betaking himself to flight-which is not dishonourable, 
<A NAME="91"></A>as people say, at certain times. This is the language of naval warfare, 
<A NAME="92"></A>and is anything but worthy of extraordinary praise. For we should not teach 
<A NAME="93"></A>bad habits, least of all to the best part of the citizens. You may learn 
<A NAME="94"></A>the evil of such a practice from Homer, by whom Odysseus is introduced, 
<A NAME="95"></A>rebuking Agamemnon because he desires to draw down the ships to the sea 
<A NAME="96"></A>at a time when the Achaeans are hard pressed by the Trojans-he gets angry 
<A NAME="97"></A>with him, and says:
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>Who, at a time when the battle is in full cry, biddest to drag 
<A NAME="99"></A>the well-benched ships into the sea, that the prayers of the Trojans may 
<A NAME="100"></A>be accomplished yet more, and high ruin falls upon us. For the Achaeans 
<A NAME="101"></A>will not maintain the battle, when the ships are drawn into the sea, but 
<A NAME="102"></A>they will look behind and will cease from strife; in that the counsel which 
<A NAME="103"></A>you give will prove injurious. You see that he quite knew triremes on the 
<A NAME="104"></A>sea, in the neighbourhood of fighting men, to be an evil;-lions might be 
<A NAME="105"></A>trained in that way to fly from a herd of deer. Moreover, naval powers 
<A NAME="106"></A>which owe their safety to ships, do not give honour to that sort of warlike 
<A NAME="107"></A>excellence which is most deserving of it. For he who owes his safety to 
<A NAME="108"></A>the pilot and the captain, and the oarsman, and all sorts of rather inferior 
<A NAME="109"></A>persons cannot rightly give honour to whom honour is due. But how can a 
<A NAME="110"></A>state be in a right condition which cannot justly award 
<A NAME="111"></A>honour?
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> It is hardly possible, I admit; and yet, Stranger, 
<A NAME="113"></A>we Cretans are in the habit of saying that the battle of Salamis was the 
<A NAME="114"></A>salvation of Hellas.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Why, yes; and that is an opinion which is widely spread 
<A NAME="116"></A>both among Hellenes and barbarians. But Megillus and I say rather, that 
<A NAME="117"></A>the battle of Marathon was the beginning, and the battle of Plataea the 
<A NAME="118"></A>completion, of the great deliverance, and that these battles by land made 
<A NAME="119"></A>the Hellenes better; whereas the sea-fights of Salamis and Artemisium-for 
<A NAME="120"></A>I may as well put them both together-made them no better, if I may say 
<A NAME="121"></A>so without offence about the battles which helped to save us. And in estimating 
<A NAME="122"></A>the goodness of a state, we regard both the situation of the country and 
<A NAME="123"></A>the order of the laws, considering that the mere preservation and continuance 
<A NAME="124"></A>of life is not the most honourable thing for men, as the vulgar think, 
<A NAME="125"></A>but the continuance of the best life, while we live; and that again, if 
<A NAME="126"></A>I am jot mistaken, is remark which has been made already.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then we have only to ask whether we are taking the course 
<A NAME="129"></A>which we acknowledge to be the best for the settlement and legislation 
<A NAME="130"></A>of states.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> The best by far.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And now let me proceed to another question: Who are to 
<A NAME="133"></A>be the colonists? May any one come out of all Crete; and is the idea that 
<A NAME="134"></A>the population in the several states is too numerous for the means of subsistence? 
<A NAME="135"></A>For I suppose that you are not going to send out a general invitation to 
<A NAME="136"></A>any Hellene who likes to come. And yet I observe that to your country settlers 
<A NAME="137"></A>have come from Argos and Aegina and other parts of Hellas. Tell me, then, 
<A NAME="138"></A>whence do you draw your recruits in the present enterprise?
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> They will come from all Crete; and of other Hellenes, 
<A NAME="140"></A>Peloponnesians will be most acceptable. For, as you truly observe, there 
<A NAME="141"></A>are Cretans of Argive descent; and the race of Cretans which has the highest 
<A NAME="142"></A>character at the present day is the Gortynian, and this has come from Gortys 
<A NAME="143"></A>in the Peloponnesus.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Cities find colonization in some respects easier if 
<A NAME="145"></A>the colonists are one race, which like a swarm of bees is sent out from 
<A NAME="146"></A>a single country, either when friends leave friends, owing to some pressure 
<A NAME="147"></A>of population or other similar necessity, or when a portion of a state 
<A NAME="148"></A>is driven by factions to emigrate. And there have been whole cities which 
<A NAME="149"></A>have taken flight when utterly conquered by a superior power in war. This, 
<A NAME="150"></A>however, which is in one way an advantage to the colonist or legislator, 
<A NAME="151"></A>in another point of view creates a difficulty. There is an element of friendship 
<A NAME="152"></A>in the community of race, and language, and language, and laws, and in 
<A NAME="153"></A>common temples and rites of worship; but colonies which are of this homogeneous 
<A NAME="154"></A>sort are apt to kick against any laws or any form of constitution differing 
<A NAME="155"></A>from that which they had at home; and although the badness of their own 
<A NAME="156"></A>laws may have been the cause of the factions which prevailed among them, 
<A NAME="157"></A>yet from the force of habit they would fain preserve the very customs which 
<A NAME="158"></A>were their ruin, and the leader of the colony, who is their legislator, 
<A NAME="159"></A>finds them troublesome and rebellious. On the other hand, the conflux of 
<A NAME="160"></A>several populations might be more disposed to listen to new laws; but then, 
<A NAME="161"></A>to make them combine and pull together, as they say of horses, is a most 
<A NAME="162"></A>difficult task, and the work of years. And yet there is nothing which tends 
<A NAME="163"></A>more to the improvement of mankind than legislation and 
<A NAME="164"></A>colonization.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> No doubt; but I should like to know why you say 
<A NAME="166"></A>so.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> My good friend, I am afraid that the course of my speculations 
<A NAME="168"></A>is leading me to say something depreciatory of legislators; but if the 
<A NAME="169"></A>word be to the purpose, there can be no harm. And yet, why am I disquieted, 
<A NAME="170"></A>for I believe that the same principle applies equally to all human 
<A NAME="171"></A>things?
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To what are you referring?
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I was going to say that man never legislates, but accidents 
<A NAME="174"></A>of all sorts, which legislate for us in all sorts of ways. The violence 
<A NAME="175"></A>of war and the hard necessity of poverty are constantly overturning governments 
<A NAME="176"></A>and changing laws. And the power of discase has often caused innovations 
<A NAME="177"></A>in the state, when there have been pestilences, or when there has been 
<A NAME="178"></A>a succession of bad seasons continuing during many years. Any one who sees 
<A NAME="179"></A>all this, naturally rushes to the conclusion of which I was speaking, that 
<A NAME="180"></A>no mortal legislates in anything, but that in human affairs chance is almost 
<A NAME="181"></A>everything. And this may be said of the arts of the sailor, and the pilot, 
<A NAME="182"></A>and the physician, and the general, and may seem to be well said; and yet 
<A NAME="183"></A>there is another thing which may be said with equal truth of all of 
<A NAME="184"></A>them.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> That God governs all things, and that chance and opportunity 
<A NAME="187"></A>co-operate with him in the government of human affairs. There is, however, 
<A NAME="188"></A>a third and less extreme view, that art should be there also; for I should 
<A NAME="189"></A>say that in a storm there must surely be a great advantage in having the 
<A NAME="190"></A>aid of the pilot's art. You would agree?
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And does not a like principle apply to legislation as well 
<A NAME="193"></A>as to other things: even supposing all the conditions to be favourable 
<A NAME="194"></A>which are needed for the happiness of the state, yet the true legislator 
<A NAME="195"></A>must from time to time appear on the scene?
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In each case the artist would be able to pray rightly for 
<A NAME="198"></A>certain conditions, and if these were granted by fortune, he would then 
<A NAME="199"></A>only require to exercise his art?
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And all the other artists just now mentioned, if they were 
<A NAME="202"></A>bidden to offer up each their special prayer, would do 
<A NAME="203"></A>so?
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And the legislator would do likewise?
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> I believe that he would.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Ath. "Come, legislator," we will say to him; "what are the conditions 
<A NAME="208"></A>which you require in a state before you can organize it?" How ought he 
<A NAME="209"></A>to answer this question? Shall I give his answer?
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> He will say-"Give me a state which is governed by a tyrant, 
<A NAME="212"></A>and let the tyrant be young and have a good memory; let him be quick at 
<A NAME="213"></A>learning, and of a courageous and noble nature; let him have that quality 
<A NAME="214"></A>which, as I said before, is the inseparable companion of all the other 
<A NAME="215"></A>parts of virtue, if there is to be any good in them."
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I suppose, Megillus, that this companion virtue of 
<A NAME="217"></A>which the Stranger speaks, must be temperance?
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes, Cleinias, temperance in the vulgar sense; not 
<A NAME="219"></A>that which in the forced and exaggerated language of some philosophers 
<A NAME="220"></A>is called prudence, but that which is the natural gift of children and 
<A NAME="221"></A>animals, of whom some live continently and others incontinently, but when 
<A NAME="222"></A>isolated, was as we said, hardly worth reckoning in the catalogue of goods. 
<A NAME="223"></A>I think that you must understand my meaning.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then our tyrant must have this as well as the other qualities, 
<A NAME="226"></A>if the state is to acquire in the best manner and in the shortest time 
<A NAME="227"></A>the form of government which is most conducive to happiness; for there 
<A NAME="228"></A>neither is nor ever will be a better or speedier way of establishing a 
<A NAME="229"></A>polity than by a tyranny.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> By what possible arguments, Stranger, can any man persuade 
<A NAME="231"></A>himself of such a monstrous doctrine?
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> There is surely no difficulty in seeing, Cleinias, 
<A NAME="233"></A>what is in accordance with the order of nature?
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> You would assume, as you say, a tyrant who was young, 
<A NAME="235"></A>temperate, quick at learning, having a good memory, courageous, of a noble 
<A NAME="236"></A>nature?
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes; and you must add fortunate; and his good fortune 
<A NAME="238"></A>must be that he is the contemporary of a great legislator, and that some 
<A NAME="239"></A>happy chance brings them together. When this has been accomplished, God 
<A NAME="240"></A>has done all that he ever does for a state which he desires to be eminently 
<A NAME="241"></A>prosperous; He has done second best for a state in which there are two 
<A NAME="242"></A>such rulers, and third best for a state in which there are three. The difficulty 
<A NAME="243"></A>increases with the increase, and diminishes with the diminution of the 
<A NAME="244"></A>number.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> You mean to say, I suppose, that the best government 
<A NAME="246"></A>is produced from a tyranny, and originates in a good lawgiver and an orderly 
<A NAME="247"></A>tyrant, and that the change from such a tyranny into a perfect form of 
<A NAME="248"></A>government takes place most easily; less easily when from an oligarchy; 
<A NAME="249"></A>and, in the third degree, from a democracy: is not that your 
<A NAME="250"></A>meaning?
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Not so; I mean rather to say that the change is best 
<A NAME="252"></A>made out of a tyranny; and secondly, out of a monarchy; and thirdly, out 
<A NAME="253"></A>of some sort of democracy: fourth, in the capacity for improvement, comes 
<A NAME="254"></A>oligarchy, which has the greatest difficulty in admitting of such a change, 
<A NAME="255"></A>because the government is in the hands of a number of potentates. I am 
<A NAME="256"></A>supposing that the legislator is by nature of the true sort, and that his 
<A NAME="257"></A>strength is united with that of the chief men of the state; and when the 
<A NAME="258"></A>ruling element is numerically small, and at the same time very strong, 
<A NAME="259"></A>as in a tyranny, there the change is likely to be easiest and most 
<A NAME="260"></A>rapid.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How? I do not understand.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And yet I have repeated what I am saying a good many times; 
<A NAME="263"></A>but I suppose that you have never seen a city which is under a 
<A NAME="264"></A>tyranny?
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> No, and I cannot say that I have any great desire to 
<A NAME="266"></A>see one.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And yet, where there is a tyranny, you might certainly 
<A NAME="268"></A>see that of which I am now speaking.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I mean that you might see how, without trouble and in no 
<A NAME="271"></A>very long period of time, the tyrant, if he wishes, can change the manners 
<A NAME="272"></A>of a state: he has only to go in the direction of virtue or of vice, whichever 
<A NAME="273"></A>he prefers, he himself indicating by his example the lines of conduct, 
<A NAME="274"></A>praising and rewarding some actions and reproving others, and degrading 
<A NAME="275"></A>those who disobey.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> But how can we imagine that the citizens in general 
<A NAME="277"></A>will at once follow the example set to them; and how can he have this power 
<A NAME="278"></A>both of persuading and of compelling them?
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let no one, my friends, persuade us that there is any 
<A NAME="280"></A>quicker and easier way in which states change their laws than when the 
<A NAME="281"></A>rulers lead: such changes never have, nor ever will, come to pass in any 
<A NAME="282"></A>other way. The real impossibility or difficulty is of another sort, and 
<A NAME="283"></A>is rarely surmounted in the course of ages; but when once it is surmounted, 
<A NAME="284"></A>ten thousand or rather all blessings follow.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Of what are you speaking?
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The difficulty is to find the divine love of temperate 
<A NAME="287"></A>and just institutions existing in any powerful forms of government, whether 
<A NAME="288"></A>in a monarchy or oligarchy of wealth or of birth. You might as well hope 
<A NAME="289"></A>to reproduce the character of Nestor, who is said to have excelled all 
<A NAME="290"></A>men in the power of speech, and yet more in his temperance. This, however, 
<A NAME="291"></A>according to the tradition, was in the times of Troy; in our own days there 
<A NAME="292"></A>is nothing of the sort; but if such an one either has or ever shall come 
<A NAME="293"></A>into being, or is now among us, blessed is he and blessed are they who 
<A NAME="294"></A>hear the wise words that flow from his lips. And this may be said of power 
<A NAME="295"></A>in general: When the supreme power in man coincides with the greatest wisdom 
<A NAME="296"></A>and temperance, then the best laws and the best constitution come into 
<A NAME="297"></A>being; but in no other way. And let what I have been saying be regarded 
<A NAME="298"></A>as a kind of sacred legend or oracle, and let this be our proof that, in 
<A NAME="299"></A>one point of view, there may be a difficulty for a city to have good laws, 
<A NAME="300"></A>but that there is another point of view in which nothing can be easier 
<A NAME="301"></A>or sooner effected, granting our supposition.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How do you mean?
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us try to amuse ourselves, old boys as we are, by moulding 
<A NAME="304"></A>in words the laws which are suitable to your state.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Let us proceed without delay.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then let us invoke God at the settlement of our state; 
<A NAME="307"></A>may he hear and be propitious to us, and come and set in order the State 
<A NAME="308"></A>and the laws!
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> May he come!
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But what form of polity are we going to give the 
<A NAME="311"></A>city?
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Tell us what you mean a little more clearly. Do you mean 
<A NAME="313"></A>some form of democracy, or oligarchy, or aristocracy, or monarchy? For 
<A NAME="314"></A>we cannot suppose that you would include tyranny.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Which of you will first tell me to which of these classes 
<A NAME="316"></A>his own government is to be referred?
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR><B>Megillus.</B> Ought I to answer first, since I am the 
<A NAME="318"></A>elder?
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Perhaps you should.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><B>Meg.</B> And yet, Stranger, I perceive that I cannot say, without 
<A NAME="321"></A>more thought, what I should call the government of Lacedaemon, for it seems 
<A NAME="322"></A>to me to be like a tyranny-the power of our Ephors is marvellously tyrannical; 
<A NAME="323"></A>and sometimes it appears to me to be of all cities the most democratical; 
<A NAME="324"></A>and who can reasonably deny that it is an aristocracy? We have also a monarchy 
<A NAME="325"></A>which is held for life, and is said by all mankind, and not by ourselves 
<A NAME="326"></A>only, to be the most ancient of all monarchies; and, therefore, when asked 
<A NAME="327"></A>on a sudden, I cannot precisely say which form of government the Spartan 
<A NAME="328"></A>is.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I am in the same difficulty, Megillus; for I do not 
<A NAME="330"></A>feel confident that the polity of Cnosus is any of these.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> The reason is, my excellent friends, that you really 
<A NAME="332"></A>have polities, but the states of which we were just now speaking are merely 
<A NAME="333"></A>aggregations of men dwelling in cities who are the subjects and servants 
<A NAME="334"></A>of a part of their own state, and each of them is named after the dominant 
<A NAME="335"></A>power; they are not polities at all. But if states are to be named after 
<A NAME="336"></A>their rulers, the true state ought to be called by the name of the God 
<A NAME="337"></A>who rules over wise men.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> And who is this God?
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> May I still make use of fable to some extent, in the hope 
<A NAME="340"></A>that I may be better able to answer your question: shall 
<A NAME="341"></A>I?
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In the primeval world, and a long while before the cities 
<A NAME="344"></A>came into being whose settlements we have described, there is said to have 
<A NAME="345"></A>been in the time of Cronos a blessed rule and life, of which the best-ordered 
<A NAME="346"></A>of existing states is a copy.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> It will be very necessary to hear about 
<A NAME="348"></A>that.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I quite agree with you; and therefore I have introduced 
<A NAME="350"></A>the subject.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Most appropriately; and since the tale is to the point, 
<A NAME="352"></A>you will do well in giving us the whole story.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> I will do as you suggest. There is a tradition of the 
<A NAME="354"></A>happy life of mankind in days when all things were spontaneous and abundant. 
<A NAME="355"></A>And of this the reason is said to have been as follows:-Cronos knew what 
<A NAME="356"></A>we ourselves were declaring, that no human nature invested with supreme 
<A NAME="357"></A>power is able to order human affairs and not overflow with insolence and 
<A NAME="358"></A>wrong. Which reflection led him to appoint not men but demigods, who are 
<A NAME="359"></A>of a higher and more divine race, to be the kings and rulers of our cities; 
<A NAME="360"></A>he did as we do with flocks of sheep and other tame animals. For we do 
<A NAME="361"></A>not appoint oxen to be the lords of oxen, or goats of goats; but we ourselves 
<A NAME="362"></A>are a superior race, and rule over them. In like manner God, in his love 
<A NAME="363"></A>of mankind, placed over us the demons, who are a superior race, and they 
<A NAME="364"></A>with great case and pleasure to themselves, and no less to us, taking care 
<A NAME="365"></A>us and giving us peace and reverence and order and justice never failing, 
<A NAME="366"></A>made the tribes of men happy and united. And this tradition, which is true, 
<A NAME="367"></A>declares that cities of which some mortal man and not God is the ruler, 
<A NAME="368"></A>have no escape from evils and toils. Still we must do all that we can to 
<A NAME="369"></A>imitate the life which is said to have existed in the days of Cronos, and, 
<A NAME="370"></A>as far as the principle of immortality dwells in us, to that we must hearken, 
<A NAME="371"></A>both in private and public life, and regulate our cities and houses according 
<A NAME="372"></A>to law, meaning by the very term "law," the distribution of mind. But if 
<A NAME="373"></A>either a single person or an oligarchy or a democracy has a soul eager 
<A NAME="374"></A>after pleasures and desires-wanting to be filled with them, yet retaining 
<A NAME="375"></A>none of them, and perpetually afflicted with an endless and insatiable 
<A NAME="376"></A>disorder; and this evil spirit, having first trampled the laws under foot, 
<A NAME="377"></A>becomes the master either of a state or of an individual-then, as I was 
<A NAME="378"></A>saying, salvation is hopeless. And now, Cleinias, we have to consider whether 
<A NAME="379"></A>you will or will not accept this tale of mine.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly we will.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> You are aware-are you not?-that there are of said to be 
<A NAME="382"></A>as many forms of laws as there are of governments, and of the latter we 
<A NAME="383"></A>have already mentioned all those which are commonly recognized. Now you 
<A NAME="384"></A>must regard this as a matter of first-rate importance. For what is to be 
<A NAME="385"></A>the standard of just and unjust, is once more the point at issue. Men say 
<A NAME="386"></A>that the law ought not to regard either military virtue, or virtue in general, 
<A NAME="387"></A>but only the interests and power and preservation of the established form 
<A NAME="388"></A>of government; this is thought by them to be the best way of expressing 
<A NAME="389"></A>the natural definition of justice.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How?
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Justice is said by them to be the interest of the 
<A NAME="392"></A>stronger.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Speak plainer.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I will:-"Surely," they say, "the governing power makes 
<A NAME="395"></A>whatever laws have authority in any state?"
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Ath. "Well," they would add, "and do you suppose that tyranny or democracy, 
<A NAME="398"></A>or any other conquering power, does not make the continuance of the power 
<A NAME="399"></A>which is possessed by them the first or principal object of their 
<A NAME="400"></A>laws?"
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How can they have any other?
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>Ath. "And whoever transgresses these laws is punished as an evil-doer 
<A NAME="403"></A>by the legislator, who calls the laws just?"
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Naturally.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>Ath. "This, then, is always the mode and fashion in which justice 
<A NAME="406"></A>exists."
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly, if they are correct in their 
<A NAME="408"></A>view.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Why, yes, this is one of those false principles of government 
<A NAME="410"></A>to which we were referring.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Which do you mean?
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Those which we were examining when we spoke of who ought 
<A NAME="413"></A>to govern whom. Did we not arrive at the conclusion that parents ought 
<A NAME="414"></A>to govern their children, and the elder the younger, and the noble the 
<A NAME="415"></A>ignoble? And there were many other principles, if you remember, and they 
<A NAME="416"></A>were not always consistent. One principle was this very principle of might, 
<A NAME="417"></A>and we said that Pindar considered violence natural and justified 
<A NAME="418"></A>it.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes; I remember.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Consider, then, to whom our state is to be entrusted. For 
<A NAME="421"></A>there is a thing which has occurred times without number in 
<A NAME="422"></A>states-
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What thing?
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> That when there has been a contest for power, those who 
<A NAME="425"></A>gain the upper hand so entirely monopolize the government, as to refuse 
<A NAME="426"></A>all share to the defeated party and their descendants-they live watching 
<A NAME="427"></A>one another, the ruling class being in perpetual fear that some one who 
<A NAME="428"></A>has a recollection of former wrongs will come into power and rise up against 
<A NAME="429"></A>them. Now, according to our view, such governments are not polities at 
<A NAME="430"></A>all, nor are laws right which are passed for the good of particular classes 
<A NAME="431"></A>and not for the good of the whole state. States which have such laws are 
<A NAME="432"></A>not polities but parties, and their notions of justice are simply unmeaning. 
<A NAME="433"></A>I say this, because I am going to assert that we must not entrust the government 
<A NAME="434"></A>in your state to any one because he is rich, or because he possesses any 
<A NAME="435"></A>other advantage, such as strength, or stature, or again birth: but he who 
<A NAME="436"></A>is most obedient to the laws of the state, he shall win the palm; and to 
<A NAME="437"></A>him who is victorious in the first degree shall be given the highest office 
<A NAME="438"></A>and chief ministry of the gods; and the second to him who bears the second 
<A NAME="439"></A>palm; and on a similar principle shall all the other be assigned to those 
<A NAME="440"></A>who come next in order. And when I call the rulers servants or ministers 
<A NAME="441"></A>of the law, I give them this name not for the sake of novelty, but because 
<A NAME="442"></A>I certainly believe that upon such service or ministry depends the well- 
<A NAME="443"></A>or ill-being of the state. For that state in which the law is subject and 
<A NAME="444"></A>has no authority, I perceive to be on the highway to ruin; but I see that 
<A NAME="445"></A>the state in which the law is above the rulers, and the rulers are the 
<A NAME="446"></A>inferiors of the law, has salvation, and every blessing which the Gods 
<A NAME="447"></A>can confer.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Truly, Stranger, you see with the keen vision of 
<A NAME="449"></A>age.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Why, yes; every man when he is young has that sort of vision 
<A NAME="451"></A>dullest, and when he is old keenest.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And now, what is to be the next step? May we not suppose 
<A NAME="454"></A>the colonists to have arrived, and proceed to make our speech to 
<A NAME="455"></A>them?
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Ath. "Friends," we say to them,-"God, as the old tradition declares, 
<A NAME="458"></A>holding in his hand the beginning, middle, and end of all that is, travels 
<A NAME="459"></A>according to his nature in a straight line towards the accomplishment of 
<A NAME="460"></A>his end. Justice always accompanies him, and is the punisher of those who 
<A NAME="461"></A>fall short of the divine law. To justice, he who would be happy holds fast, 
<A NAME="462"></A>and follows in her company with all humility and order; but he who is lifted 
<A NAME="463"></A>up with pride, or elated by wealth or rank, or beauty, who is young and 
<A NAME="464"></A>foolish, and has a soul hot with insolence, and thinks that he has no need 
<A NAME="465"></A>of any guide or ruler, but is able himself to be the guide of others, he, 
<A NAME="466"></A>I say, is left deserted of God; and being thus deserted, he takes to him 
<A NAME="467"></A>others who are like himself, and dances about, throwing all things into 
<A NAME="468"></A>confusion, and many think that he is a great man, but in a short time he 
<A NAME="469"></A>pays a penalty which justice cannot but approve, and is utterly destroyed, 
<A NAME="470"></A>and his family and city with him. Wherefore, seeing that human things are 
<A NAME="471"></A>thus ordered, what should a wise man do or think, or not do or 
<A NAME="472"></A>think?
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Every man ought to make up his mind that he will be 
<A NAME="474"></A>one of the followers of God; there can be no doubt of 
<A NAME="475"></A>that.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then what life is agreeable to God, and becoming in 
<A NAME="477"></A>his followers? One only, expressed once for all in the old saying that 
<A NAME="478"></A>"like agrees with like, with measure measure," but things which have no 
<A NAME="479"></A>measure agree neither with themselves nor with the things which have. Now 
<A NAME="480"></A>God ought to be to us the measure of all things, and not man, as men commonly 
<A NAME="481"></A>say (Protagoras): the words are far more true of him. And he who would 
<A NAME="482"></A>be dear to God must, as far as is possible, be like him and such as he 
<A NAME="483"></A>is. Wherefore the temperate man is the friend of God, for he is like him; 
<A NAME="484"></A>and the intemperate man is unlike him, and different from him, and unjust. 
<A NAME="485"></A>And the same applies to other things; and this is the conclusion, which 
<A NAME="486"></A>is also the noblest and truest of all sayings-that for the good man to 
<A NAME="487"></A>offer sacrifice to the Gods, and hold converse with them by means of prayers 
<A NAME="488"></A>and offerings and every kind of service, is the noblest and best of all 
<A NAME="489"></A>things, and also the most conducive to a happy life, and very fit and meet. 
<A NAME="490"></A>But with the bad man, the opposite of this is true: for the bad man has 
<A NAME="491"></A>an impure soul, whereas the good is pure; and from one who is polluted, 
<A NAME="492"></A>neither good man nor God can without impropriety receive gifts. Wherefore 
<A NAME="493"></A>the unholy do only waste their much service upon the Gods, but when offered 
<A NAME="494"></A>by any holy man, such service is most acceptable to them. This is the mark 
<A NAME="495"></A>at which we ought to aim. But what weapons shall we use, and how shall 
<A NAME="496"></A>we direct them? In the first place, we affirm that next after the Olympian 
<A NAME="497"></A>Gods and the Gods of the State, honour should be given to the Gods below; 
<A NAME="498"></A>they should receive everything in even and of the second choice, and ill 
<A NAME="499"></A>omen, while the odd numbers, and the first choice, and the things of lucky 
<A NAME="500"></A>omen, are given to the Gods above, by him who would rightly hit the mark 
<A NAME="501"></A>of piety. Next to these Gods, a wise man will do service to the demons 
<A NAME="502"></A>or spirits, and then to the heroes, and after them will follow the private 
<A NAME="503"></A>and ancestral Gods, who are worshipped as the law prescribes in the places 
<A NAME="504"></A>which are sacred to them. Next comes the honour of living parents, to whom, 
<A NAME="505"></A>as is meet, we have to pay the first and greatest and oldest of all debts, 
<A NAME="506"></A>considering that all which a man has belongs to those who gave him birth 
<A NAME="507"></A>and brought him up, and that he must do all that he can to minister to 
<A NAME="508"></A>them, first, in his property, secondly, in his person, and thirdly, in 
<A NAME="509"></A>his soul, in return for the endless care and travail which they bestowed 
<A NAME="510"></A>upon him of old, in the days of his infancy, and which he is now to pay 
<A NAME="511"></A>back to them when they are old and in the extremity of their need. And 
<A NAME="512"></A>all his life long he ought never to utter, or to have uttered, an unbecoming 
<A NAME="513"></A>word to them; for of light and fleeting words the penalty is most severe; 
<A NAME="514"></A>Nemesis, the messenger of justice, is appointed to watch over all such 
<A NAME="515"></A>matters. When they are angry and want to satisfy their feelings in word 
<A NAME="516"></A>or deed, he should give way to them; for a father who thinks that he has 
<A NAME="517"></A>been wronged by his son may be reasonably expected to be very angry. At 
<A NAME="518"></A>their death, the most moderate funeral is best, neither exceeding the customary 
<A NAME="519"></A>expense, nor yet falling short of the honour which has been usually shown 
<A NAME="520"></A>by the former generation to their parents. And let a man not forget to 
<A NAME="521"></A>pay the yearly tribute of respect to the dead, honouring them chiefly by 
<A NAME="522"></A>omitting nothing that conduces to a perpetual remembrance of them, and 
<A NAME="523"></A>giving a reasonable portion of his fortune to the dead. Doing this, and 
<A NAME="524"></A>living after this manner, we shall receive our reward from the Gods and 
<A NAME="525"></A>those who are above us [i.e., the demons]; and we shall spend our days 
<A NAME="526"></A>for the most part in good hope. And how a man ought to order what relates 
<A NAME="527"></A>to his descendants and his kindred and friends and fellow-citizens, and 
<A NAME="528"></A>the rites of hospitality taught by Heaven, and the intercourse which arises 
<A NAME="529"></A>out of all these duties, with a view to the embellishment and orderly regulation 
<A NAME="530"></A>of his own life-these things, I say, the laws, as we proceed with them, 
<A NAME="531"></A>will accomplish, partly persuading, and partly when natures do not yield 
<A NAME="532"></A>to the persuasion of custom, chastising them by might and right, and will 
<A NAME="533"></A>thus render our state, if the Gods co-operate with us, prosperous and happy. 
<A NAME="534"></A>But of what has to be said, and must be said by the legislator who is of 
<A NAME="535"></A>my way of thinking, and yet, if said in the form of law, would be out of 
<A NAME="536"></A>place-of this I think that he may give a sample for the instruction of 
<A NAME="537"></A>himself and of those for whom he is legislating; and then when, as far 
<A NAME="538"></A>as he is able, he has gone through all the preliminaries, he may proceed 
<A NAME="539"></A>to the work of legislation. Now, what will be the form of such prefaces? 
<A NAME="540"></A>There may be a difficulty in including or describing them all under a single 
<A NAME="541"></A>form, but I think that we may get some notion of them if we can guarantee 
<A NAME="542"></A>one thing.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What is that?
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I should wish the citizens to be as readily persuaded to 
<A NAME="545"></A>virtue as possible; this will surely be the aim of the legislator in all 
<A NAME="546"></A>his laws.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The proposal appears to me to be of some value; and I think 
<A NAME="549"></A>that a person will listen with more gentleness and good-will to the precepts 
<A NAME="550"></A>addressed to him by the legislator, when his soul is not altogether unprepared 
<A NAME="551"></A>to receive them. Even a little done in the way of conciliation gains his 
<A NAME="552"></A>ear, and is always worth having. For there is no great inclination or readiness 
<A NAME="553"></A>on the part of mankind to be made as good, or as quickly good, as possible. 
<A NAME="554"></A>The case of the many proves the wisdom of Hesiod, who says that the road 
<A NAME="555"></A>to wickedness is smooth and can be travelled without perspiring, because 
<A NAME="556"></A>it is so very short:
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>But before virtue the immortal Gods have placed the sweat of labour, 
<A NAME="558"></A>and long and steep is the way thither, and rugged at first; but when you 
<A NAME="559"></A>have reached the top, although difficult before, it is then 
<A NAME="560"></A>easy.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes; and he certainly speaks well.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Very true: and now let me tell you the effect which the 
<A NAME="563"></A>preceding discourse has had upon me.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Proceed.
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Suppose that we have a little conversation with the legislator, 
<A NAME="566"></A>and say to him-"O, legislator, speak; if you know what we ought to say 
<A NAME="567"></A>and do, you can surely tell."
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Of course he can.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Ath. "Did we not hear you just now saying, that the legislator ought 
<A NAME="570"></A>not to allow the poets to do what they liked? For that they would not know 
<A NAME="571"></A>in which of their words they went against the laws, to the hurt of the 
<A NAME="572"></A>state."
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That is true.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> May we not fairly make answer to him on behalf of the 
<A NAME="575"></A>poets?
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> What answer shall we make to him?
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> That the poet, according to the tradition which has ever 
<A NAME="578"></A>prevailed among us, and is accepted of all men, when he sits down on the 
<A NAME="579"></A>tripod of the muse, is not in his right mind; like a fountain, he allows 
<A NAME="580"></A>to flow out freely whatever comes in, and his art being imitative, he is 
<A NAME="581"></A>often compelled to represent men of opposite dispositions, and thus to 
<A NAME="582"></A>contradict himself; neither can he tell whether there is more truth in 
<A NAME="583"></A>one thing that he has said than in another. this is not the case in a law; 
<A NAME="584"></A>the legislator must give not two rules about the same thing, but one only. 
<A NAME="585"></A>Take an example from what you have just been saying. Of three kinds of 
<A NAME="586"></A>funerals, there is one which is too extravagant, another is too niggardly, 
<A NAME="587"></A>the third is a mean; and you choose and approve and order the last without 
<A NAME="588"></A>qualification. But if I had an extremely rich wife, and she bade me bury 
<A NAME="589"></A>her and describe her burial in a poem, I should praise the extravagant 
<A NAME="590"></A>sort; and a poor miserly man, who had not much money to spend, would approve 
<A NAME="591"></A>of the niggardly; and the man of moderate means, who was himself moderate, 
<A NAME="592"></A>would praise a moderate funeral. Now you in the capacity of legislator 
<A NAME="593"></A>must not barely say "a moderate funeral," but you must define what moderation 
<A NAME="594"></A>is, and how much; unless you are definite, you must not suppose that you 
<A NAME="595"></A>are speaking a language that can become law.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And is our legislator to have no preface to his laws, but 
<A NAME="598"></A>to say at once Do this, avoid that-and then holding the penalty in terrorem 
<A NAME="599"></A>to go on to another law; offering never a word of advice or exhortation 
<A NAME="600"></A>to those for whom he is legislating, after the manner of some doctors? 
<A NAME="601"></A>For of doctors, as I may remind you, some have a gentler, others a ruder 
<A NAME="602"></A>method of cure; and as children ask the doctor to be gentle with them, 
<A NAME="603"></A>so we will ask the legislator to cure our disorders with the gentlest remedies. 
<A NAME="604"></A>What I mean to say is, that besides doctors there are doctors' servants, 
<A NAME="605"></A>who are also styled doctors.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And whether they are slaves or freemen makes no difference; 
<A NAME="608"></A>they acquire their knowledge of medicine by obeying and observing their 
<A NAME="609"></A>masters; empirically and not according to the natural way of learning, 
<A NAME="610"></A>as the manner of freemen is, who have learned scientifically themselves 
<A NAME="611"></A>the art which they impart scientifically to their pupils. You are aware 
<A NAME="612"></A>that there are these two classes of doctors?
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And did you ever observe that there are two classes of 
<A NAME="615"></A>patients in states, slaves and freemen; and the slave doctors run about 
<A NAME="616"></A>and cure the slaves, or wait for them in the dispensaries-practitioners 
<A NAME="617"></A>of this sort never talk to their patients individually, or let them talk 
<A NAME="618"></A>about their own individual complaints? The slave doctor prescribes what 
<A NAME="619"></A>mere experience suggests, as if he had exact knowledge; and when he has 
<A NAME="620"></A>given his orders, like a tyrant, he rushes off with equal assurance to 
<A NAME="621"></A>some other servant who is ill; and so he relieves the master of the house 
<A NAME="622"></A>of the care of his invalid slaves. But the other doctor, who is a freeman, 
<A NAME="623"></A>attends and practises upon freemen; and he carries his enquiries far back, 
<A NAME="624"></A>and goes into the nature of the disorder; he enters into discourse with 
<A NAME="625"></A>the patient and with his friends, and is at once getting information from 
<A NAME="626"></A>the sick man, and also instructing him as far as he is able, and he will 
<A NAME="627"></A>not prescribe for him until he has first convinced him; at last, when he 
<A NAME="628"></A>has brought the patient more and more under his persuasive influences and 
<A NAME="629"></A>set him on the road to health, he attempts to effect a cure. Now which 
<A NAME="630"></A>is the better way of proceeding in a physician and in a trainer? Is he 
<A NAME="631"></A>the better who accomplishes his ends in a double way, or he who works in 
<A NAME="632"></A>one way, and that the ruder and inferior?
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I should say, Stranger, that the double way is far 
<A NAME="634"></A>better.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Should you like to see an example of the double and single 
<A NAME="636"></A>method in legislation?
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly I should.
<A NAME="638"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> What will be our first law? Will not the the order of nature, 
<A NAME="639"></A>begin by making regulations for states about births?
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> He will.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In all states the birth of children goes back to the connection 
<A NAME="642"></A>of marriage?
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And, according to the true order, the laws relating to 
<A NAME="645"></A>marriage should be those which are first determined in every 
<A NAME="646"></A>state?
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Quite so.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then let me first give the law of marriage in a simple 
<A NAME="649"></A>form; it may run as follows:-A man shall marry between the ages of thirty 
<A NAME="650"></A>and thirty-five, or, if he does not, he shall pay such and such a fine, 
<A NAME="651"></A>or shall suffer the loss of such and such privileges. This would be the 
<A NAME="652"></A>simple law about marriage. The double law would run thus:-A man shall marry 
<A NAME="653"></A>between the ages of thirty and thirty-five, considering that in a manner 
<A NAME="654"></A>the human race naturally partakes of immortality, which every man is by 
<A NAME="655"></A>nature inclined to desire to the utmost; for the desire of every man that 
<A NAME="656"></A>he may become famous, and not lie in the grave without a name, is only 
<A NAME="657"></A>the love of continuance. Now mankind are coeval with all time, and are 
<A NAME="658"></A>ever following, and will ever follow, the course of time; and so they are 
<A NAME="659"></A>immortal, because they leave children's children behind them, and partake 
<A NAME="660"></A>of immortality in the unity of generation. And for a man voluntarily to 
<A NAME="661"></A>deprive himself of this gift, as he deliberately does who will not have 
<A NAME="662"></A>a wife or children, is impiety. He who obeys the law shall be free, and 
<A NAME="663"></A>shall pay no fine; but he who is disobedient, and does not marry, when 
<A NAME="664"></A>he has arrived at the age of thirty-five, shall pay a yearly fine of a 
<A NAME="665"></A>certain amount, in order that he may not imagine his celibacy to bring 
<A NAME="666"></A>ease and profit to him; and he shall not share in the honours which the 
<A NAME="667"></A>young men in the state give to the aged. Comparing now the two forms of 
<A NAME="668"></A>the law, you will be able to arrive at a judgment about any other laws-whether 
<A NAME="669"></A>they should be double in length even when shortest, because they have to 
<A NAME="670"></A>persuade as well as threaten, or whether they shall only threaten and be 
<A NAME="671"></A>of half the length.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> The shorter form, Stranger, would be more in accordance 
<A NAME="673"></A>with Lacedaemonian custom; although, for my own part, if any one were to 
<A NAME="674"></A>ask me which I myself prefer in the state, I should certainly determine 
<A NAME="675"></A>in favour of the longer; and I would have every law made after the same 
<A NAME="676"></A>pattern, if I had to choose. But I think that Cleinias is the person to 
<A NAME="677"></A>be consulted, for his is the state which is going to use these 
<A NAME="678"></A>laws.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Thank you, Megillus.
<A NAME="680"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Whether, in the abstract, words are to be many or few, 
<A NAME="681"></A>is a very foolish question; the best form, and not the shortest, is to 
<A NAME="682"></A>be approved; nor is length at all to be regarded. Of the two forms of law 
<A NAME="683"></A>which have been recited, the one is not only twice as good in practical 
<A NAME="684"></A>usefulness as the other, but the case is like that of the two kinds of 
<A NAME="685"></A>doctors, which I was just now mentioning. And yet legislators never appear 
<A NAME="686"></A>to have considered that they have two instruments which they might use 
<A NAME="687"></A>in legislation-persuasion and force; for in dealing with the rude and uneducated 
<A NAME="688"></A>multitude, they use the one only as far as they can; they do not mingle 
<A NAME="689"></A>persuasion with coercion, but employ force pure and simple. Moreover, there 
<A NAME="690"></A>is a third point, sweet friends, which ought to be, and never is, regarded 
<A NAME="691"></A>in our existing laws.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="693"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> A point arising out of our previous discussion, which comes 
<A NAME="694"></A>into my mind in some mysterious way. All this time, from early dawn until 
<A NAME="695"></A>noon, have we been talking about laws in this charming retreat: now we 
<A NAME="696"></A>are going to promulgate our laws, and what has preceded was only the prelude 
<A NAME="697"></A>of them. Why do I mention this? For this reason:-Because all discourses 
<A NAME="698"></A>and vocal exercises have preludes and overtures, which are a sort of artistic 
<A NAME="699"></A>beginnings intended to help the strain which is to be performed; lyric 
<A NAME="700"></A>measures and music of every other kind have preludes framed with wonderful 
<A NAME="701"></A>care. But of the truer and higher strain of law and politics, no one has 
<A NAME="702"></A>ever yet uttered any prelude, or composed or published any, as though there 
<A NAME="703"></A>was no such thing in nature. Whereas our present discussion seems to me 
<A NAME="704"></A>to imply that there is;-these double laws, of which we were speaking, are 
<A NAME="705"></A>not exactly double, but they are in two parts, the law and the prelude 
<A NAME="706"></A>of the law. The arbitrary command, which was compared to the commands of 
<A NAME="707"></A>doctors, whom we described as of the meaner sort, was the law pure and 
<A NAME="708"></A>simple; and that which preceded, and was described by our friend here as 
<A NAME="709"></A>being hortatory only, was, although in fact, an exhortation, likewise analogous 
<A NAME="710"></A>to the preamble of a discourse. For I imagine that all this language of 
<A NAME="711"></A>conciliation, which the legislator has been uttering in the preface of 
<A NAME="712"></A>the law, was intended to create goodwill in the person whom he addressed, 
<A NAME="713"></A>in order that, by reason of this good-will, he might more intelligently 
<A NAME="714"></A>receive his command, that is to say, the law. And therefore, in my way 
<A NAME="715"></A>of speaking, this is more rightly described as the preamble than as the 
<A NAME="716"></A>matter of the law. And I must further proceed to observe, that to all his 
<A NAME="717"></A>laws, and to each separately, the legislator should prefix a preamble; 
<A NAME="718"></A>he should remember how great will be the difference between them, according 
<A NAME="719"></A>as they have, or have not, such preambles, as in the case already 
<A NAME="720"></A>given.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> The lawgiver, if he asks my opinion, will certainly 
<A NAME="722"></A>legislate in the form which you advise.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> I think that you are right, Cleinias, in affirming 
<A NAME="724"></A>that all laws have preambles, and that throughout the whole of this work 
<A NAME="725"></A>of legislation every single law should have a suitable preamble at the 
<A NAME="726"></A>beginning; for that which is to follow is most important, and it makes 
<A NAME="727"></A>all the difference whether we clearly remember the preambles or not. Yet 
<A NAME="728"></A>we should be wrong in requiring that all laws, small and great alike, should 
<A NAME="729"></A>have preambles of the same kind, any more than all songs or speeches; although 
<A NAME="730"></A>they may be natural to all, they are not always necessary, and whether 
<A NAME="731"></A>they are to be employed or not has in each case to be left to the judgment 
<A NAME="732"></A>of the speaker or the musician, or, in the present instance, of the 
<A NAME="733"></A>lawgiver.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That I think is most true. And now, Stranger, without 
<A NAME="735"></A>delay let us return to the argument, and, as people say in play, make a 
<A NAME="736"></A>second and better beginning, if you please, with the principles which we 
<A NAME="737"></A>have been laying down, which we never thought of regarding as a preamble 
<A NAME="738"></A>before, but of which we may now make a preamble, and not merely consider 
<A NAME="739"></A>them to be chance topics of discourse. Let us acknowledge, then, that we 
<A NAME="740"></A>have a preamble. About the honour of the Gods and the respect of parents, 
<A NAME="741"></A>enough has been already said; and we may proceed to the topics which follow 
<A NAME="742"></A>next in order, until the preamble is deemed by you to be complete; and 
<A NAME="743"></A>after that you shall go through the laws themselves.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> I understand you to mean that we have made a sufficient 
<A NAME="745"></A>preamble about Gods and demi-gods, and about parents living or dead; and 
<A NAME="746"></A>now you would have us bring the rest of the subject into the light of 
<A NAME="747"></A>day?
<A NAME="748"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Exactly.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> After this, as is meet and for the interest of us all, 
<A NAME="750"></A>I the speaker, and you the listeners, will try to estimate all that relates 
<A NAME="751"></A>to the souls and bodies and properties of the citizens, as regards both 
<A NAME="752"></A>their occupations and arrive, as far as in us lies, at the nature of education. 
<A NAME="753"></A>These then are the topics which follow next in order.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very good.
