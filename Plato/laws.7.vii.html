<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>And now, assuming children of both sexes to have been born, it will be 
<A NAME="11"></A>proper for us to consider, in the next place, their nurture and education; 
<A NAME="12"></A>this cannot be left altogether unnoticed, and yet may be thought a subject 
<A NAME="13"></A>fitted rather for precept and admonition than for law. In private life 
<A NAME="14"></A>there are many little things, not always apparent, arising out of the pleasures 
<A NAME="15"></A>and pains and desires of individuals, which run counter to the intention 
<A NAME="16"></A>of the legislator, and make the characters of the citizens various and 
<A NAME="17"></A>dissimilar:-this is an evil in states; for by reason of their smallness 
<A NAME="18"></A>and frequent occurrence, there would be an unseemliness and want of propriety 
<A NAME="19"></A>in making them penal by law; and if made penal, they are the destruction 
<A NAME="20"></A>of the written law because mankind get the habit of frequently transgressing 
<A NAME="21"></A>the law in small matters. The result is that you cannot legislate about 
<A NAME="22"></A>them, and still less can you be silent. I speak somewhat darkly, but I 
<A NAME="23"></A>shall endeavour also to bring my wares into the light of day, for I acknowledge 
<A NAME="24"></A>that at present there is a want of clearness in what I am 
<A NAME="25"></A>saying.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR><B>Cleinias.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><B>Athenian.</B> Stranger. Am I not right in maintaining that a good 
<A NAME="28"></A>education is that which tends most, to the improvement of mind and 
<A NAME="29"></A>body?
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Undoubtedly.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And nothing can be plainer than that the fairest bodies 
<A NAME="32"></A>are those which grow up from infancy in the best and straightest 
<A NAME="33"></A>manner?
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And do we not further observe that the first shoot of every 
<A NAME="36"></A>living thing is by far the greatest and fullest? Many will even contend 
<A NAME="37"></A>that a man at twenty-five does not reach twice the height which he attained 
<A NAME="38"></A>at five.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Well, and is not rapid growth without proper and abundant 
<A NAME="41"></A>exercise the source endless evils in the body?
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And the body should have the most exercise when it receives 
<A NAME="44"></A>most nourishment?
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> But, Stranger, are we to impose this great amount of 
<A NAME="46"></A>exercise upon newly-born infants?
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Nay, rather on the bodies of infants still 
<A NAME="48"></A>unborn.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> What do you mean, my good sir? In the process of 
<A NAME="50"></A>gestation?
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Exactly. I am not at all surprised that you have never 
<A NAME="52"></A>heard of this very peculiar sort of gymnastic applied to such little creatures, 
<A NAME="53"></A>which, although strange, I will endeavour to explain to 
<A NAME="54"></A>you.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The practice is more easy for us to understand than for 
<A NAME="57"></A>you, by reason of certain amusements which are carried to excess by us 
<A NAME="58"></A>at Athens. Not only boys, but often older persons, are in the habit of 
<A NAME="59"></A>keeping quails and cocks, which they train to fight one another. And they 
<A NAME="60"></A>are far from thinking that the contests in which they stir them up to fight 
<A NAME="61"></A>with one another are sufficient exercise; for, in addition to this, they 
<A NAME="62"></A>carry them about tucked beneath their armpits, holding the smaller birds 
<A NAME="63"></A>in their hands, the larger under their arms, and go for a walk of a great 
<A NAME="64"></A>many miles for the sake of health, that is to say, not their own, health, 
<A NAME="65"></A>but the health of the birds; whereby they prove to any intelligent person, 
<A NAME="66"></A>that all bodies are benefited by shakings and movements, when they are 
<A NAME="67"></A>moved without weariness, whether motion proceeds from themselves, or is 
<A NAME="68"></A>caused by a swing, or at sea, or on horseback, or by other bodies in whatever 
<A NAME="69"></A>way moving, and that thus gaining the mastery over food and drink, they 
<A NAME="70"></A>are able to impart beauty and health and strength. But admitting all this, 
<A NAME="71"></A>what follows? Shall we make a ridiculous law that the pregnant woman shall 
<A NAME="72"></A>walk about and fashion the embryo within as we fashion wax before it hardens, 
<A NAME="73"></A>and after birth swathe the infant for two years? Suppose that we compel 
<A NAME="74"></A>nurses, under penalty of a legal fine, to be always carrying the children 
<A NAME="75"></A>somewhere or other, either to the temples, or into the country, or to their 
<A NAME="76"></A>relations, houses, until they are well able to stand, and to take care 
<A NAME="77"></A>that their limbs are not distorted by leaning on them when they are too 
<A NAME="78"></A>young-they should continue to carry them until the infant has completed 
<A NAME="79"></A>its third year; the nurses should be strong, and there should be more than 
<A NAME="80"></A>one of them. Shall these be our rules, and shall we impose a penalty for 
<A NAME="81"></A>the neglect of them? No, no; the penalty of which we were speaking will 
<A NAME="82"></A>fall upon our own heads more than enough.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What penalty?
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Ridicule, and the difficulty of getting the feminine and 
<A NAME="85"></A>servant-like dispositions of the nurses to comply.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Then why was there any need to speak of the matter 
<A NAME="87"></A>at all?
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The reason is that masters and freemen in states, when 
<A NAME="89"></A>they hear of it, are very likely to arrive at a true conviction that without 
<A NAME="90"></A>due regulation of private life in cities, stability in the laying down 
<A NAME="91"></A>of laws is hardly to be expected; and he who makes this reflection may 
<A NAME="92"></A>himself adopt the laws just now mentioned, and, adopting them, may order 
<A NAME="93"></A>his house and state well and be happy.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Likely enough.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And therefore let us proceed with our legislation until 
<A NAME="96"></A>we have determined the exercises which are suited to the souls of young 
<A NAME="97"></A>children, in the same manner in which we have begun to go through the rules 
<A NAME="98"></A>relating to their bodies.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us assume, then, as a first principle in relation both 
<A NAME="101"></A>to the body and soul of very young creatures, that nursing and moving about 
<A NAME="102"></A>by day and night is good for them all, and that the younger they are, the 
<A NAME="103"></A>more they will need it; infants should live, if that were possible, as 
<A NAME="104"></A>if they were always rocking at sea. This is the lesson which we may gather 
<A NAME="105"></A>from the experience of nurses, and likewise from the use of the remedy 
<A NAME="106"></A>of motion in the rites of the Corybantes; for when mothers want their restless 
<A NAME="107"></A>children to go to sleep they do not employ rest, but, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="108"></A>motion-rocking them in their arms; nor do they give them silence, but they 
<A NAME="109"></A>sing to them and lap them in sweet strains; and the Bacchic women are cured 
<A NAME="110"></A>of their frenzy in the same manner by the use of the dance and of 
<A NAME="111"></A>music.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Well, Stranger, and what is the reason of 
<A NAME="113"></A>this?
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The reason is obvious.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> What?
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The affection both of the Bacchantes and of the children 
<A NAME="117"></A>is an emotion of fear, which springs out of an evil habit of the soul. 
<A NAME="118"></A>And when some one applies external agitation to affections of this sort, 
<A NAME="119"></A>the motion coming from without gets the better of the terrible and violent 
<A NAME="120"></A>internal one, and produces a peace and calm in the soul, and quiets the 
<A NAME="121"></A>restless palpitation of the heart, which is a thing much to be desired, 
<A NAME="122"></A>sending the children to sleep, and making the Bacchantes, although they 
<A NAME="123"></A>remain awake, to dance to the pipe with the help of the Gods to whom they 
<A NAME="124"></A>offer acceptable sacrifices, and producing in them a sound mind, which 
<A NAME="125"></A>takes the place of their frenzy. And, to express what I mean in a word, 
<A NAME="126"></A>there is a good deal to be said in favour of this treatment.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But if fear has such a power we ought to infer from these 
<A NAME="129"></A>facts, that every soul which from youth upward has been familiar with fears, 
<A NAME="130"></A>will be made more liable to fear, and every one will allow that this is 
<A NAME="131"></A>the way to form a habit of cowardice and not of courage.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> No doubt.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And, on the other hand, the habit of overcoming, from our 
<A NAME="134"></A>youth upwards, the fears and terrors which beset us, may be said to be 
<A NAME="135"></A>an exercise of courage.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And we may say that the use of exercise and motion in the 
<A NAME="138"></A>earliest years of life greatly contributes to create a part of virtue in 
<A NAME="139"></A>the soul.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Further, a cheerful temper, or the reverse, may be regarded 
<A NAME="142"></A>as having much to do with high spirit on the one hand, or with cowardice 
<A NAME="143"></A>on the other.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then now we must endeavour to show how and to what extent 
<A NAME="146"></A>we may, if we please, without difficulty implant either character in the 
<A NAME="147"></A>young.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> There is a common opinion, that luxury makes the disposition 
<A NAME="150"></A>of youth discontented and irascible and vehemently excited by trifles; 
<A NAME="151"></A>that on the other hand excessive and savage servitude makes men mean and 
<A NAME="152"></A>abject, and haters of their kind, and therefore makes them undesirable 
<A NAME="153"></A>associates.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> But how must the state educate those who do not as 
<A NAME="155"></A>yet understand the language of the country, and are therefore incapable 
<A NAME="156"></A>of appreciating any sort of instruction?
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> I will tell you how:-Every animal that is born is wont 
<A NAME="158"></A>to utter some cry, and this is especially the case with man, and he is 
<A NAME="159"></A>also affected with the inclination to weep more than any other 
<A NAME="160"></A>animal.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Do not nurses, when they want to know what an infant desires, 
<A NAME="163"></A>judge by these signs?-when anything is brought to the infant and he is 
<A NAME="164"></A>silent, then he is supposed to be pleased, but, when he weeps and cries 
<A NAME="165"></A>out, then he is not pleased. For tears and cries are the inauspicious signs 
<A NAME="166"></A>by which children show what they love and hate. Now the time which is thus 
<A NAME="167"></A>spent is no less than three years, and is a very considerable portion of 
<A NAME="168"></A>life to be passed ill or well.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Does not the discontented and ungracious nature appear 
<A NAME="171"></A>to you to be full of lamentations and sorrows more than a good man ought 
<A NAME="172"></A>to be?
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Well, but if during these three years every possible care 
<A NAME="175"></A>were taken that our nursling should have as little of sorrow and fear, 
<A NAME="176"></A>and in general of pain as was possible, might we not expect in early childhood 
<A NAME="177"></A>to make his soul more gentle and cheerful?
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To be sure, Stranger-more especially if we could procure 
<A NAME="179"></A>him a variety of pleasures.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> There I can no longer agree, Cleinias: you amaze me. 
<A NAME="181"></A>To bring him up in such a way would be his utter ruin; for the beginning 
<A NAME="182"></A>is always the most critical part of education. Let us see whether I am 
<A NAME="183"></A>right.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Proceed.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The point about which you and I differ is of great importance, 
<A NAME="186"></A>and I hope that you, Megillus, will help to decide between us. For I maintain 
<A NAME="187"></A>that the true life should neither seek for pleasures, nor, on the other 
<A NAME="188"></A>hand, entirely avoid pains, but should embrace the middle state, which 
<A NAME="189"></A>I just spoke of as gentle and benign, and is a state which we by some divine 
<A NAME="190"></A>presage and inspiration rightly ascribe to God. Now, I say, he among men, 
<A NAME="191"></A>too, who would be divine ought to pursue after this mean habit-he should 
<A NAME="192"></A>not rush headlong into pleasures, for he will not be free from pains; nor 
<A NAME="193"></A>should we allow any one, young or old, male or female, to be thus given 
<A NAME="194"></A>any more than ourselves, and least of all the newly-born infant, for in 
<A NAME="195"></A>infancy more than at any other time the character is engrained by habit. 
<A NAME="196"></A>Nay, more, if I were not afraid of appearing to be ridiculous, I would 
<A NAME="197"></A>say that a woman during her year of pregnancy should of all women be most 
<A NAME="198"></A>carefully tended, and kept from violent or excessive pleasures and pains, 
<A NAME="199"></A>and should at that time cultivate gentleness and benevolence and 
<A NAME="200"></A>kindness.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> You need not, ask Megillus, Stranger, which of us has 
<A NAME="202"></A>most truly spoken; for I myself agree that all men ought to avoid the life 
<A NAME="203"></A>of unmingled pain or pleasure, and pursue always a middle course. And having 
<A NAME="204"></A>spoken well, may I add that you have been well answered?
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Very good, Cleinias; and now let us all three consider 
<A NAME="206"></A>a further point.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> That all the matters which we are now describing are commonly 
<A NAME="209"></A>called by the general name of unwritten customs, and what are termed the 
<A NAME="210"></A>laws of our ancestors are all of similar nature. And the reflection which 
<A NAME="211"></A>lately arose in our minds, that we can neither call these things laws, 
<A NAME="212"></A>nor yet leave them unmentioned, is justified; for they are the bonds of 
<A NAME="213"></A>the whole state, and come in between the written laws which are or are 
<A NAME="214"></A>hereafter to be laid down; they are just ancestral customs of great antiquity, 
<A NAME="215"></A>which, if they are rightly ordered and made habitual, shield and preserve 
<A NAME="216"></A>the previously existing written law; but if they depart from right and 
<A NAME="217"></A>fall into disorder, then they are like the props of builders which slip 
<A NAME="218"></A>away out of their Place and cause a universal ruin-one part drags another 
<A NAME="219"></A>down, and the fair super-structure falls because the old foundations are 
<A NAME="220"></A>undermined. Reflecting upon this, Cleinias, you ought to bind together 
<A NAME="221"></A>the new state in every possible way, omitting nothing, whether great or 
<A NAME="222"></A>small, of what are called laws or manners or pursuits, for by these means 
<A NAME="223"></A>a city is bound together, and all these things are only lasting when they 
<A NAME="224"></A>depend upon one another; and, therefore, we must not wonder if we find 
<A NAME="225"></A>that many apparently trifling customs or usages come pouring in and lengthening 
<A NAME="226"></A>out our laws.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true: we are disposed to agree with 
<A NAME="228"></A>you.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Up to the age of three years, whether of boy or girl, if 
<A NAME="230"></A>a person strictly carries out our previous regulations and makes them a 
<A NAME="231"></A>principal aim, he will do much for the advantage of the young creatures. 
<A NAME="232"></A>But at three, four, five, and even six years the childish nature will require 
<A NAME="233"></A>sports; now is the time to get rid of self-will in him, punishing him, 
<A NAME="234"></A>but not so as to disgrace him. We were saying about slaves, that we ought 
<A NAME="235"></A>neither to add insult to punishment so as to anger them, nor yet to leave 
<A NAME="236"></A>them unpunished lest they become self-willed; and a like rule is to be 
<A NAME="237"></A>observed in the case of the free-born. Children at that age have certain 
<A NAME="238"></A>natural modes of amusement which they find out for themselves when they 
<A NAME="239"></A>meet. And all the children who are between the ages of three and six ought 
<A NAME="240"></A>to meet at the temples the villages, the several families of a village 
<A NAME="241"></A>uniting on one spot. The nurses are to see that the children behave properly 
<A NAME="242"></A>and orderly-they themselves and all their companies are to be under the 
<A NAME="243"></A>control of twelve matrons, one for each company, who are annually selected 
<A NAME="244"></A>to inspect them from the women previously mentioned, [i.e., the women who 
<A NAME="245"></A>have authority over marriage], whom the guardians of the law appoint. These 
<A NAME="246"></A>matrons shall be chosen by the women who have authority over marriage, 
<A NAME="247"></A>one out of each tribe; all are to be of the same age; and let each of them, 
<A NAME="248"></A>as soon as she is appointed, hold office and go to the temples every day, 
<A NAME="249"></A>punishing all offenders, male or female, who are slaves or strangers, by 
<A NAME="250"></A>the help of some of the public slaves; but if any citizen disputes the 
<A NAME="251"></A>punishment, let her bring him before the wardens of the city; or, if there 
<A NAME="252"></A>be no dispute, let her punish him herself. After the age of six years the 
<A NAME="253"></A>time has arrived for the separation of the sexes-let boys live with boys, 
<A NAME="254"></A>and girls in like manner with girls. Now they must begin to learn-the boys 
<A NAME="255"></A>going to teachers of horsemanship and the use of the bow, the javelin, 
<A NAME="256"></A>and sling, and the girls too, if they do not object, at any rate until 
<A NAME="257"></A>they know how to manage these weapons, and especially how to handle heavy 
<A NAME="258"></A>arms; for I may note, that the practice which now prevails is almost universally 
<A NAME="259"></A>misunderstood.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> In what respect?
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In that the right and left hand are supposed to be by nature 
<A NAME="262"></A>differently suited for our various uses of them; whereas no difference 
<A NAME="263"></A>is found in the use of the feet and the lower limbs; but in the use of 
<A NAME="264"></A>the hands we are, as it were, maimed by the folly of nurses and mothers; 
<A NAME="265"></A>for although our several limbs are by nature balanced, we create a difference 
<A NAME="266"></A>in them by bad habit. In some cases this is of no consequence, as, for 
<A NAME="267"></A>example, when we hold the lyre in the left hand, and the plectrum in the 
<A NAME="268"></A>right, but it is downright folly to make the same distinction in other 
<A NAME="269"></A>cases. The custom of the Scythians proves our error; for they not only 
<A NAME="270"></A>hold the bow from them with the left hand and draw the arrow to them with 
<A NAME="271"></A>their right, but use either hand for both purposes. And there are many 
<A NAME="272"></A>similar examples in charioteering and other things, from which we may learn 
<A NAME="273"></A>that those who make the left side weaker than the right act contrary to 
<A NAME="274"></A>nature. In the case of the plectrum, which is of horn only, and similar 
<A NAME="275"></A>instruments, as I was saying, it is of no consequence, but makes a great 
<A NAME="276"></A>difference, and may be of very great importance to the warrior who has 
<A NAME="277"></A>to use iron weapons, bows and javelins, and the like; above all, when in 
<A NAME="278"></A>heavy armour, he has to fight against heavy armour. And there is a very 
<A NAME="279"></A>great difference between one who has learnt and one who has not, and between 
<A NAME="280"></A>one who has been trained in gymnastic exercises and one who has not been. 
<A NAME="281"></A>For as he who is perfectly skilled in the Pancratium or boxing or wrestling, 
<A NAME="282"></A>is not unable to fight from his left side, and does not limp and draggle 
<A NAME="283"></A>in confusion when his opponent makes him change his position, so in heavy-armed 
<A NAME="284"></A>fighting, and in all other things if I am not mistaken, the like holds-he 
<A NAME="285"></A>who has these double powers of attack and defence ought not in any case 
<A NAME="286"></A>to leave them either unused or untrained, if he can help; and if a person 
<A NAME="287"></A>had the nature of Geryon or Briareus he ought to be able with his hundred 
<A NAME="288"></A>hands to throw a hundred darts. Now, the magistrates, male and female, 
<A NAME="289"></A>should see to all these things, the women superintending the nursing and 
<A NAME="290"></A>amusements of the children, and the men superintending their education, 
<A NAME="291"></A>that all of them, boys and girls alike, may be sound hand and foot, and 
<A NAME="292"></A>may not, if they can help, spoil the gifts of nature by bad 
<A NAME="293"></A>habits.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>Education has two branches-one of gymnastic, which is concerned 
<A NAME="295"></A>with the body, and the other of music, which is designed for the improvement 
<A NAME="296"></A>of the soul. And gymnastic has also two branches-dancing and wrestling; 
<A NAME="297"></A>and one sort of dancing imitates musical recitation, and aims at preserving 
<A NAME="298"></A>dignity and freedom, the other aims at producing health, agility, and beauty 
<A NAME="299"></A>in the limbs and parts of the body, giving the proper flexion and extension 
<A NAME="300"></A>to each of them, a harmonious motion being diffused everywhere, and forming 
<A NAME="301"></A>a suitable accompaniment to the dance. As regards wrestling, the tricks 
<A NAME="302"></A>which Antaeus and Cercyon devised in their systems out of a vain spirit 
<A NAME="303"></A>of competition, or the tricks of boxing which Epeius or Amycus invented, 
<A NAME="304"></A>are useless and unsuitable for war, and do not deserve to have much said 
<A NAME="305"></A>about them; but the art of wrestling erect and keeping free the neck and 
<A NAME="306"></A>hands and sides, working with energy and constancy, with a composed strength, 
<A NAME="307"></A>and for the sake of health-these are always useful, and are not to be neglected, 
<A NAME="308"></A>but to be enjoined alike on masters and scholars, when we reach that part 
<A NAME="309"></A>of legislation; and we will desire the one to give their instructions freely, 
<A NAME="310"></A>and the others to receive them thankfully. Nor, again, must we omit suitable 
<A NAME="311"></A>imitations of war in our choruses; here in Crete you have the armed dances 
<A NAME="312"></A>if the Curetes, and the Lacedaemonians have those of the Dioscuri. And 
<A NAME="313"></A>our virgin lady, delighting in the amusement of the dance, thought it not 
<A NAME="314"></A>fit to amuse herself with empty hands; she must be clothed in a complete 
<A NAME="315"></A>suit of armour, and in this attire go through the dance; and youths and 
<A NAME="316"></A>maidens should in every respect imitate her, esteeming highly the favour 
<A NAME="317"></A>of the Goddess, both with a view to the necessities of war, and to festive 
<A NAME="318"></A>occasions: it will be right also for the boys, until such time as they 
<A NAME="319"></A>go out to war, to make processions and supplications to all the Gods in 
<A NAME="320"></A>goodly array, armed and on horseback, in dances, and marches, fast or slow, 
<A NAME="321"></A>offering up prayers to the Gods and to the sons of Gods; and also engaging 
<A NAME="322"></A>in contests and preludes of contests, if at all, with these objects: For 
<A NAME="323"></A>these sorts of exercises, and no others, are useful both in peace and war, 
<A NAME="324"></A>and are beneficial alike to states and to private houses. But other labours 
<A NAME="325"></A>and sports and exercises of the body are unworthy of freemen, O Megillus 
<A NAME="326"></A>and Cleinias.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>I have now completely described the kind of gymnastic which I said 
<A NAME="328"></A>at first ought to be described; if you know of any better, will you communicate 
<A NAME="329"></A>your thoughts?
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> It is not easy, Stranger, to put aside these principles 
<A NAME="331"></A>of gymnastic and wrestling and to enunciate better ones.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Now we must say what has yet to be said about the gifts 
<A NAME="333"></A>of the Muses and of Apollo: before, we fancied that we had said all, and 
<A NAME="334"></A>that gymnastic alone remained; but now we see clearly what points have 
<A NAME="335"></A>been omitted, and should be first proclaimed; of these, then, let us proceed 
<A NAME="336"></A>to speak.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let me tell you once more-although you have heard me say 
<A NAME="339"></A>the same before that caution must be always exercised, both by the speaker 
<A NAME="340"></A>and by the hearer, about anything that is very singular and unusual. For 
<A NAME="341"></A>my tale is one, which many a man would be afraid to tell, and yet I have 
<A NAME="342"></A>a confidence which makes me go on.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What have you to say, Stranger?
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I say that in states generally no one has observed that 
<A NAME="345"></A>the plays of childhood have a great deal to do with the permanence or want 
<A NAME="346"></A>of permanence in legislation. For when plays are ordered with a view to 
<A NAME="347"></A>children having the same plays, and amusing themselves after the same manner, 
<A NAME="348"></A>and finding delight in the same playthings, the more solemn institutions 
<A NAME="349"></A>of the state are allowed to remain undisturbed. Whereas if sports are disturbed, 
<A NAME="350"></A>and innovations are made in them, and they constantly change, and the young 
<A NAME="351"></A>never speak of their having the same likings, or the same established notions 
<A NAME="352"></A>of good and bad taste, either in the bearing of their bodies or in their 
<A NAME="353"></A>dress, but he who devises something new and out of the way in figures and 
<A NAME="354"></A>colours and the like is held in special honour, we may truly say that no 
<A NAME="355"></A>greater evil can happen in a state; for he who changes the sports is secretly 
<A NAME="356"></A>changing the manners of the young, and making the old to be dishonoured 
<A NAME="357"></A>among them and the new to be honoured. And I affirm that there is nothing 
<A NAME="358"></A>which is a greater injury to all states than saying or thinking thus. Will 
<A NAME="359"></A>you hear me tell how great I deem the evil to be?
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> You mean the evil of blaming antiquity in 
<A NAME="361"></A>states?
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Exactly.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> If you are speaking of that, you will find in us hearers 
<A NAME="364"></A>who are disposed to receive what you say not unfavourably but most 
<A NAME="365"></A>favourably.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> I should expect so.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Proceed.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Well, then, let us give all the greater heed to one another's 
<A NAME="369"></A>words. The argument affirms that any change whatever except from evil is 
<A NAME="370"></A>the most dangerous of all things; this is true in the case of the seasons 
<A NAME="371"></A>and of the winds, in the management of our bodies and the habits of our 
<A NAME="372"></A>minds-true of all things except, as I said before, of the bad. He who looks 
<A NAME="373"></A>at the constitution of individuals accustomed to eat any sort of meat, 
<A NAME="374"></A>or drink any drink, or to do any work which they can get, may see that 
<A NAME="375"></A>they are at first disordered by them, but afterwards, as time goes on, 
<A NAME="376"></A>their bodies grow adapted to them, and they learn to know and like variety, 
<A NAME="377"></A>and have good health and enjoyment of life; and if ever afterwards they 
<A NAME="378"></A>are confined again to a superior diet, at first they are troubled with 
<A NAME="379"></A>disorders, and with difficulty become habituated to their new food. A similar 
<A NAME="380"></A>principle we may imagine to hold good about the minds of men and the natures 
<A NAME="381"></A>of their souls. For when they have been brought up in certain laws, which 
<A NAME="382"></A>by some Divine Providence have remained unchanged during long ages, so 
<A NAME="383"></A>that no one has any memory or tradition of their ever having been otherwise 
<A NAME="384"></A>than they are, then every one is afraid and ashamed to change that which 
<A NAME="385"></A>is established. The legislator must somehow find a way of implanting this 
<A NAME="386"></A>reverence for antiquity, and I would propose the following way:-People 
<A NAME="387"></A>are apt to fancy, as I was saying before, that when the plays of children 
<A NAME="388"></A>are altered they are merely plays, not seeing that the most serious and 
<A NAME="389"></A>detrimental consequences arise out of the change; and they readily comply 
<A NAME="390"></A>with the child's wishes instead of deterring him, not considering that 
<A NAME="391"></A>these children who make innovations in their games, when they grow up to 
<A NAME="392"></A>be men, will be different from the last generation of children, and, being 
<A NAME="393"></A>different, will desire a different sort of life, and under the influence 
<A NAME="394"></A>of this desire will want other institutions and laws; and no one of them 
<A NAME="395"></A>reflects that there will follow what I just now called the greatest of 
<A NAME="396"></A>evils to states. Changes in bodily fashions are no such serious evils, 
<A NAME="397"></A>but frequent changes in the praise and censure of manners are the greatest 
<A NAME="398"></A>of evils, and require the utmost prevision.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And now do we still hold to our former assertion, that 
<A NAME="401"></A>rhythms and music in general are imitations of good and evil characters 
<A NAME="402"></A>in men? What say you?
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That is the only doctrine which we can 
<A NAME="404"></A>admit.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Must we not, then, try in every possible way to prevent 
<A NAME="406"></A>our youth from even desiring to imitate new modes either in dance or song? 
<A NAME="407"></A>nor must any one be allowed to offer them varieties of 
<A NAME="408"></A>pleasures.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Can any of us imagine a better mode of effecting this object 
<A NAME="411"></A>than that of the Egyptians?
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What is their method?
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> To consecrate every sort of dance or melody. First we should 
<A NAME="414"></A>ordain festivals-calculating for the year what they ought to be, and at 
<A NAME="415"></A>what time, and in honour of what Gods, sons of Gods, and heroes they ought 
<A NAME="416"></A>to be celebrated; and, in the next place, what hymns ought to be sung at 
<A NAME="417"></A>the several sacrifices, and with what dances the particular festival is 
<A NAME="418"></A>to be honoured. This has to be arranged at first by certain persons, and, 
<A NAME="419"></A>when arranged, the whole assembly of the citizens are to offer sacrifices 
<A NAME="420"></A>and libations to the Fates and all the other Gods, and to consecrate the 
<A NAME="421"></A>several odes to gods and heroes: and if any one offers any other hymns 
<A NAME="422"></A>or dances to any one of the Gods, the priests and priestesses, acting in 
<A NAME="423"></A>concert with the guardians of the law, shall, with the sanction of religion 
<A NAME="424"></A>and the law, exclude him, and he who is excluded, if he do not submit, 
<A NAME="425"></A>shall be liable all his life long to have a suit of impiety brought against 
<A NAME="426"></A>him by any one who likes.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In the consideration of this subject, let us remember what 
<A NAME="429"></A>is due to ourselves.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To what are you referring?
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I mean that any young man, and much more any old one, when 
<A NAME="432"></A>he sees or hears anything strange or unaccustomed, does not at once run 
<A NAME="433"></A>to embrace the paradox, but he stands considering, like a person who is 
<A NAME="434"></A>at a place where three paths meet, and does not very well know his way-he 
<A NAME="435"></A>may be alone or he may be walking with others, and he will say to himself 
<A NAME="436"></A>and them, "Which is the way?" and will not move forward until he is satisfied 
<A NAME="437"></A>that he is going right. And this is what we must do in the present instance:-A 
<A NAME="438"></A>strange discussion on the subject of law has arisen, which requires the 
<A NAME="439"></A>utmost consideration, and we should not at our age be too ready to speak 
<A NAME="440"></A>about such great matters, or be confident that we can say anything certain 
<A NAME="441"></A>all in a moment.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then we will allow time for reflection, and decide when 
<A NAME="444"></A>we have given the subject sufficient consideration. But that we may not 
<A NAME="445"></A>be hindered from completing the natural arrangement of our laws, let us 
<A NAME="446"></A>proceed to the conclusion of them in due order; for very possibly, if God 
<A NAME="447"></A>will, the exposition of them, when completed, may throw light on our present 
<A NAME="448"></A>perplexity.
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Excellent, Stranger; let us do as you 
<A NAME="450"></A>propose.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us then affirm the paradox that strains of music are 
<A NAME="452"></A>our laws (nomoi), and this latter being the name which the ancients gave 
<A NAME="453"></A>to lyric songs, they probably would not have very much objected to our 
<A NAME="454"></A>proposed application of the word. Some one, either asleep or awake, must 
<A NAME="455"></A>have had a dreamy suspicion of their nature. And let our decree be as follows:-No 
<A NAME="456"></A>one in singing or dancing shall offend against public and consecrated models, 
<A NAME="457"></A>and the general fashion among the youth, any more than he would offend 
<A NAME="458"></A>against any other law. And he who observes this law shall be blameless; 
<A NAME="459"></A>but he who is disobedient, as I was saying, shall be punished by the guardians 
<A NAME="460"></A>of the laws, and by the priests and priestesses. Suppose that we imagine 
<A NAME="461"></A>this to be our law.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Can any one who makes such laws escape ridicule? Let us 
<A NAME="464"></A>see. I think that our only safety will be in first framing certain models 
<A NAME="465"></A>for composers. One of these models shall be as follows:-If when a sacrifice 
<A NAME="466"></A>is going on, and the victims are being burnt according to law-if, I say, 
<A NAME="467"></A>any one who may be a son or brother, standing by another at the altar and 
<A NAME="468"></A>over the victims, horribly blasphemes, will not his words inspire despondency 
<A NAME="469"></A>and evil omens and forebodings in the mind of his father and of his other 
<A NAME="470"></A>kinsmen?
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And this is just what takes place in almost all our cities. 
<A NAME="473"></A>A magistrate offers a public sacrifice, and there come in not one but many 
<A NAME="474"></A>choruses, who take up a position a little way from the altar, and from 
<A NAME="475"></A>time to time pour forth all sorts of horrible blasphemies on the sacred 
<A NAME="476"></A>rites, exciting the souls of the audience with words and rhythms and melodies 
<A NAME="477"></A>most sorrowful to hear; and he who at the moment when the city is offering 
<A NAME="478"></A>sacrifice makes the citizens weep most, carries away the palm of victory. 
<A NAME="479"></A>Now, ought we not to forbid such strains as these? And if ever our citizens 
<A NAME="480"></A>must hear such lamentations, then on some unblest and inauspicious day 
<A NAME="481"></A>let there be choruses of foreign and hired minstrels, like those hirelings 
<A NAME="482"></A>who accompany the departed at funerals with barbarous Carian chants. That 
<A NAME="483"></A>is the sort of thing which will be appropriate if we have such strains 
<A NAME="484"></A>at all; and let the apparel of the singers be, not circlets and ornaments 
<A NAME="485"></A>of gold, but the reverse. Enough of all this. I will simply ask once more 
<A NAME="486"></A>whether we shall lay down as one of our principles of 
<A NAME="487"></A>song-
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What?
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> That we should avoid every word of evil omen; let that 
<A NAME="490"></A>kind of song which is of good omen be heard everywhere and always in our 
<A NAME="491"></A>state. I need hardly ask again, but shall assume that you agree with 
<A NAME="492"></A>me.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> By all means; that law is approved by the suffrages 
<A NAME="494"></A>of us all.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But what shall be our next musical law or type? Ought not 
<A NAME="496"></A>prayers to be offered up to the Gods when we sacrifice?
<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And our third law, if I am not mistaken, will be to the 
<A NAME="499"></A>effect that our poets, understanding prayers to be requests which we make 
<A NAME="500"></A>to the Gods, will take especial heed that they do not by mistake ask for 
<A NAME="501"></A>evil instead of good. To make such a prayer would surely be too 
<A NAME="502"></A>ridiculous.
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Were we not a little while ago quite convinced that no 
<A NAME="505"></A>silver or golden Plutus should dwell in our state?
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And what has it been the object of our argument to show? 
<A NAME="508"></A>Did we not imply that the poets are not always quite capable of knowing 
<A NAME="509"></A>what is good or evil? And if one of them utters a mistaken prayer in song 
<A NAME="510"></A>or words, he will make our citizens pray for the opposite of what is good 
<A NAME="511"></A>in matters of the highest import; than which, as I was saying, there can 
<A NAME="512"></A>be few greater mistakes. Shall we then propose as one of our laws and models 
<A NAME="513"></A>relating to the Muses-
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What?-will you explain the law more 
<A NAME="515"></A>precisely?
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Shall we make a law that the poet shall compose nothing 
<A NAME="517"></A>contrary to the ideas of the lawful, or just, or beautiful, or good, which 
<A NAME="518"></A>are allowed in the state? nor shall he be permitted to communicate his 
<A NAME="519"></A>compositions to any private individuals, until he shall have shown them 
<A NAME="520"></A>to the appointed judges and the guardians of the law, and they are satisfied 
<A NAME="521"></A>with them. As to the persons whom we appoint to be our legislators about 
<A NAME="522"></A>music and as to the director of education, these have been already indicated. 
<A NAME="523"></A>Once more then, as I have asked more than once, shall this be our third 
<A NAME="524"></A>law, and type, and model-What do you say?
<A NAME="525"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Let it be so, by all means.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then it will be proper to have hymns and praises of the 
<A NAME="527"></A>Gods, intermingled with prayers; and after the Gods prayers and praises 
<A NAME="528"></A>should be offered in like manner to demigods and heroes, suitable to their 
<A NAME="529"></A>several characters.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In the next place there will be no objection to a law, 
<A NAME="532"></A>that citizens who are departed and have done good and energetic deeds, 
<A NAME="533"></A>either with their souls or with their bodies, and have been obedient to 
<A NAME="534"></A>the laws, should receive eulogies; this will be very 
<A NAME="535"></A>fitting.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But to honour with hymns and panegyrics those who are still 
<A NAME="538"></A>alive is not safe; a man should run his course, and make a fair ending, 
<A NAME="539"></A>and then we will praise him; and let praise be given equally to women as 
<A NAME="540"></A>well as men who have been distinguished in virtue. The order of songs and 
<A NAME="541"></A>dances shall be as follows:-There are many ancient musical compositions 
<A NAME="542"></A>and dances which are excellent, and from these the newly-founded city may 
<A NAME="543"></A>freely select what is proper and suitable; and they shall choose judges 
<A NAME="544"></A>of not less than fifty years of age, who shall make the selection, and 
<A NAME="545"></A>any of the old poems which they deem sufficient they shall include; any 
<A NAME="546"></A>that are deficient or altogether unsuitable, they shall either utterly 
<A NAME="547"></A>throw aside, or examine and amend, taking into their counsel poets and 
<A NAME="548"></A>musicians, and making use of their poetical genius; but explaining to them 
<A NAME="549"></A>the wishes of the legislator in order that they may regulate dancing, music, 
<A NAME="550"></A>and all choral strains, according to the mind of the judges; and not allowing 
<A NAME="551"></A>them to indulge, except in some few matters, their individual pleasures 
<A NAME="552"></A>and fancies. Now the irregular strain of music is always made ten thousand 
<A NAME="553"></A>times better by attaining to law and order, and rejecting the honeyed Muse-not 
<A NAME="554"></A>however that we mean wholly to exclude pleasure, which is the characteristic 
<A NAME="555"></A>of all music. And if a man be brought up from childhood to the age of discretion 
<A NAME="556"></A>and maturity in the use of the orderly and severe music, when he hears 
<A NAME="557"></A>the opposite he detests it, and calls it illiberal; but if trained in the 
<A NAME="558"></A>sweet and vulgar music, he deems the severer kind cold and displeasing. 
<A NAME="559"></A>So that, as I was saying before, while he who hears them gains no more 
<A NAME="560"></A>pleasure from the one than from the other, the one has the advantage of 
<A NAME="561"></A>making those who are trained in it better men, whereas the other makes 
<A NAME="562"></A>them worse.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Again, we must distinguish and determine on some general 
<A NAME="565"></A>principle what songs are suitable to women, and what to men, and must assign 
<A NAME="566"></A>to them their proper melodies and rhythms. It is shocking for a whole harmony 
<A NAME="567"></A>to be inharmonical, or for a rhythm to be unrhythmical, and this will happen 
<A NAME="568"></A>when the melody is inappropriate to them. And therefore the legislator 
<A NAME="569"></A>must assign to these also their forms. Now both sexes have melodies and 
<A NAME="570"></A>rhythms which of necessity belong to them; and those of women are clearly 
<A NAME="571"></A>enough indicated by their natural difference. The grand, and that which 
<A NAME="572"></A>tends to courage, may be fairly called manly; but that which inclines to 
<A NAME="573"></A>moderation and temperance, may be declared both in law and in ordinary 
<A NAME="574"></A>speech to be the more womanly quality. This, then, will be the general 
<A NAME="575"></A>order of them.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>Let us now speak of the manner of teaching and imparting them, 
<A NAME="577"></A>and the persons to whom, and the time when, they are severally to be imparted. 
<A NAME="578"></A>As the shipwright first lays down the lines of the keel, and thus, as it 
<A NAME="579"></A>were, draws the ship in outline, so do I seek to distinguish the patterns 
<A NAME="580"></A>of life, and lay down their keels according to the nature of different 
<A NAME="581"></A>men's souls; seeking truly to consider by what means, and in what ways, 
<A NAME="582"></A>we may go through the voyage of life best. Now human affairs are hardly 
<A NAME="583"></A>worth considering in earnest, and yet we must be in earnest about them-a 
<A NAME="584"></A>sad necessity constrains us. And having got thus far, there will be a fitness 
<A NAME="585"></A>in our completing the matter, if we can only find some suitable method 
<A NAME="586"></A>of doing so. But what do I mean? Some one may ask this very question, and 
<A NAME="587"></A>quite rightly, too.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I say that about serious matters a man should be serious, 
<A NAME="590"></A>and about a matter which is not serious he should not be, serious; and 
<A NAME="591"></A>that God is the natural and worthy object of our most serious and blessed 
<A NAME="592"></A>endeavours, for man, as I said before, is made to be the plaything of God, 
<A NAME="593"></A>and this, truly considered, is the best of him; wherefore also every man 
<A NAME="594"></A>and woman should walk seriously, and pass life in the noblest of pastimes, 
<A NAME="595"></A>and be of another mind from what they are at present.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> In what respect?
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> At present they think that their serious suits should be 
<A NAME="598"></A>for the sake of their sports, for they deem war a serious. pursuit, which 
<A NAME="599"></A>must be managed well for the sake of peace; but the truth is, that there 
<A NAME="600"></A>neither is, nor has been, nor ever will be, either amusement or instruction 
<A NAME="601"></A>in any degree worth, speaking of in war, which is nevertheless deemed by 
<A NAME="602"></A>us to be the most serious of our pursuits. And therefore, as we say, every 
<A NAME="603"></A>one of us should live the life of peace as long and as well as he can. 
<A NAME="604"></A>And what is the right way of living? Are we to live in sports always? If 
<A NAME="605"></A>so, in what kind of sports? We ought to live sacrificing, and singing, 
<A NAME="606"></A>and dancing, and then a man will be able to propitiate the Gods, and to 
<A NAME="607"></A>defend himself against his enemies and conquer them in battle. The type 
<A NAME="608"></A>of song or dance by which he will propitiate them has been described, and 
<A NAME="609"></A>the paths along which he is to proceed have been cut for him. He will go 
<A NAME="610"></A>forward in the spirit of the poet:
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR>Telemachus, some things thou wilt thyself find in thy heart, but 
<A NAME="612"></A>other things God will suggest; for I deem that thou wast not brought up 
<A NAME="613"></A>without the will of the Gods. And this ought to be the view of our alumni; 
<A NAME="614"></A>they ought to think that what has been said is enough for them, and that 
<A NAME="615"></A>any other things their Genius and God will suggest to them-he will tell 
<A NAME="616"></A>them to whom, and when, and to what Gods severally they are to sacrifice 
<A NAME="617"></A>and perform dances, and how they may propitiate the deities, and live according 
<A NAME="618"></A>to the appointment of nature; being for the most part puppets, but having 
<A NAME="619"></A>some little share of reality.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR><B>Megillus.</B> You have a low opinion of mankind, 
<A NAME="621"></A>Stranger.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Nay, Megillus, be not amazed, but forgive me:-I was comparing 
<A NAME="623"></A>them with the Gods; and under that feeling I spoke. Let us grant, if you 
<A NAME="624"></A>wish, that the human race is not to be despised, but is worthy of some 
<A NAME="625"></A>consideration.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>Next follow the buildings for gymnasia and schools open to all; 
<A NAME="627"></A>these are to be in three places in the midst of the city; and outside the 
<A NAME="628"></A>city and in the surrounding country, also in three places, there shall 
<A NAME="629"></A>be schools for horse exercise, and large grounds arranged with a view to 
<A NAME="630"></A>archery and the throwing of missiles, at which young men may learn and 
<A NAME="631"></A>practise. Of these mention has already been made, and if the mention be 
<A NAME="632"></A>not sufficiently explicit, let us speak, further of them and embody them 
<A NAME="633"></A>in laws. In these several schools let there be dwellings for teachers, 
<A NAME="634"></A>who shall be brought from foreign parts by pay, and let them teach those 
<A NAME="635"></A>who attend the schools the art of war and the art of music, and the children 
<A NAME="636"></A>shall come not only if their parents please, but if they do not please; 
<A NAME="637"></A>there shall be compulsory education, as the saying is, of all and sundry, 
<A NAME="638"></A>as far this is possible; and the pupils shall be regarded as belonging 
<A NAME="639"></A>to the state rather than to their parents. My law would apply to females 
<A NAME="640"></A>as well as males; they shall both go through the same exercises. I assert 
<A NAME="641"></A>without fear of contradiction that gymnastic and horsemanship are as suitable 
<A NAME="642"></A>to women as to men. Of the truth of this I am persuaded from ancient tradition, 
<A NAME="643"></A>and at the present day there are said to be countless myriads of women 
<A NAME="644"></A>in the neighbourhood of the Black Sea, called Sauromatides, who not only 
<A NAME="645"></A>ride on horseback like men, but have enjoined upon them the use of bows 
<A NAME="646"></A>and other weapons equally with the men. And I further affirm, that if these 
<A NAME="647"></A>things are possible, nothing can be more absurd than the practice which 
<A NAME="648"></A>prevails in our own country, of men and women not following the same pursuits 
<A NAME="649"></A>with all their strength and with one mind, for thus the state, instead 
<A NAME="650"></A>of being a whole, is reduced to a half, but has the same imposts to pay 
<A NAME="651"></A>and the same toils to undergo; and what can be a greater mistake for any 
<A NAME="652"></A>legislator to make than this?
<A NAME="653"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true; yet much of what has been asserted by us, 
<A NAME="654"></A>Stranger is contrary to the custom of states; still, in saying that the 
<A NAME="655"></A>discourse should be allowed to proceed, and that when the discussion is 
<A NAME="656"></A>completed, we should choose what seems best, you spoke very properly, and 
<A NAME="657"></A>I now feel compunction for what I have said. Tell me, then, what you would 
<A NAME="658"></A>next wish to say.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> I should wish to say, Cleinias, as I said before, that 
<A NAME="660"></A>if the possibility of these things were not sufficiently proven in fact, 
<A NAME="661"></A>then there might be an objection to the argument, but the fact being as 
<A NAME="662"></A>I have said, he who rejects the law must find some other ground of objection; 
<A NAME="663"></A>and, failing this, our exhortation will still hold good, nor will any one 
<A NAME="664"></A>deny that women ought to share as far as possible in education and in other 
<A NAME="665"></A>ways with men. For consider;-if women do not share in their whole life 
<A NAME="666"></A>with men, then they must have some other order of life.
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And what arrangement of life to be found anywhere is preferable 
<A NAME="669"></A>to this community which we are now assigning to them? Shall we prefer that 
<A NAME="670"></A>which is adopted by the Thracians and many other races who use their women 
<A NAME="671"></A>to till the ground and to be shepherds of their herds and flocks, and to 
<A NAME="672"></A>minister to them like slaves?-Or shall we do as we and people in our part 
<A NAME="673"></A>of the world do-getting together, as the phrase is, all our goods and chattels 
<A NAME="674"></A>into one dwelling, we entrust them to our women, who are the stewards of 
<A NAME="675"></A>them, and who also preside over the shuttles and the whole art of spinning? 
<A NAME="676"></A>Or shall we take a middle course, in Lacedaemon, Megillus-letting the girls 
<A NAME="677"></A>share in gymnastic and music, while the grown-up women, no longer employed 
<A NAME="678"></A>in spinning wool, are hard at work weaving the web of life, which will 
<A NAME="679"></A>be no cheap or mean employment, and in the duty of serving and taking care 
<A NAME="680"></A>of the household and bringing up children, in which they will observe a 
<A NAME="681"></A>sort of mean, not participating in the toils of war; and if there were 
<A NAME="682"></A>any necessity that they should fight for their city and families, unlike 
<A NAME="683"></A>the Amazons, they would be unable to take part in archery or any other 
<A NAME="684"></A>skilled use of missiles, nor could they, after the example of the Goddess, 
<A NAME="685"></A>carry shield or spear, or stand up nobly for their country when it was 
<A NAME="686"></A>being destroyed, and strike terror into their enemies, if only because 
<A NAME="687"></A>they were seen in regular order? Living as they do, they would never dare 
<A NAME="688"></A>at all to imitate the Sauromatides, who, when compared with ordinary women, 
<A NAME="689"></A>would appear to be like men. Let him who will, praise your legislators, 
<A NAME="690"></A>but I must say what I think. The legislator ought to be whole and perfect, 
<A NAME="691"></A>and not half a man only; he ought not to let the female sex live softly 
<A NAME="692"></A>and waste money and have no order of life, while he takes the utmost care 
<A NAME="693"></A>of the male sex, and leaves half of life only blest with happiness, when 
<A NAME="694"></A>he might have made the whole state happy.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> What shall we do, Cleinias? Shall we allow a stranger 
<A NAME="696"></A>to run down Sparta in this fashion?
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes; for as we have given him liberty of speech we 
<A NAME="698"></A>must let him go on until we have perfected the work of 
<A NAME="699"></A>legislation.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then now I may proceed?
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> What will be the manner of life among men who may be supposed 
<A NAME="704"></A>to have their food and clothing provided for them in moderation, and who 
<A NAME="705"></A>have entrusted the practice of the arts to others, and whose husbandry, 
<A NAME="706"></A>committed to slaves paying a part of the produce, brings them a return 
<A NAME="707"></A>sufficient for men living temperately; who, moreover, have common tables 
<A NAME="708"></A>in which the men are placed apart, and near them are the common tables 
<A NAME="709"></A>of their families, of their daughters and mothers, which day by day, the 
<A NAME="710"></A>officers, male and female, are to inspect-they shall see to the behaviour 
<A NAME="711"></A>of the company, and so dismiss them; after which the presiding magistrate 
<A NAME="712"></A>and his attendants shall honour with libations those Gods to whom that 
<A NAME="713"></A>day and night are dedicated, and then go home? To men whose lives are thus 
<A NAME="714"></A>ordered, is there no work remaining to be done which is necessary and fitting, 
<A NAME="715"></A>but shall each one of them live fattening like a beast? Such a life is 
<A NAME="716"></A>neither just nor honourable, nor can he who lives it fail of meeting his 
<A NAME="717"></A>due; and the due reward of the idle fatted beast is that he should be torn 
<A NAME="718"></A>in pieces by some other valiant beast whose fatness is worn down by brave 
<A NAME="719"></A>deeds and toil. These regulations, if we duly consider them, will never 
<A NAME="720"></A>be exactly carried into execution under present circumstances, nor as long 
<A NAME="721"></A>as women and children and houses and all other things are the private property 
<A NAME="722"></A>of individuals; but if we can attain the second-best form of polity, we 
<A NAME="723"></A>shall be very well off. And to men living under this second polity there 
<A NAME="724"></A>remains a work to be accomplished which is far from being small or insignificant, 
<A NAME="725"></A>but is the greatest of all works, and ordained by the appointment of righteous 
<A NAME="726"></A>law. For the life which may be truly said to be concerned with the virtue 
<A NAME="727"></A>of body and soul is twice, or more than twice, as full of toil and trouble 
<A NAME="728"></A>as the pursuit after Pythian and Olympic victories, which debars a man 
<A NAME="729"></A>from every employment of life. For there ought to be no bye-work interfering 
<A NAME="730"></A>with the greater work of providing the necessary exercise and nourishment 
<A NAME="731"></A>for the body, and instruction and education for the soul. Night and day 
<A NAME="732"></A>are not long enough for the accomplishment of their perfection and consummation; 
<A NAME="733"></A>and therefore to this end all freemen ought to arrange the way in which 
<A NAME="734"></A>they will spend their time during the whole course of the day, from morning 
<A NAME="735"></A>till evening and from evening till the morning of the next sunrise. There 
<A NAME="736"></A>may seem to be some impropriety in the legislator determining minutely 
<A NAME="737"></A>the numberless details of the management of the house, including such particulars 
<A NAME="738"></A>as the duty of wakefulness in those who are to be perpetual watchmen of 
<A NAME="739"></A>the whole city; for that any citizen should continue during the whole of 
<A NAME="740"></A>any night in sleep, instead of being seen by all his servants, always the 
<A NAME="741"></A>first to awake and get up-this, whether the regulation is to be called 
<A NAME="742"></A>a law or only a practice, should be deemed base and unworthy of a freeman; 
<A NAME="743"></A>also that the mistress of the house should be awakened by her handmaidens 
<A NAME="744"></A>instead of herself first awakening them, is what the slaves, male and female, 
<A NAME="745"></A>and the serving-boys, and, if that were possible, everybody and everything 
<A NAME="746"></A>in the house should regard as base. If they rise early, they may all of 
<A NAME="747"></A>them do much of their public and of their household business, as magistrates 
<A NAME="748"></A>in the city, and masters and mistresses in their private houses, before 
<A NAME="749"></A>the sun is up. Much sleep is not required by nature, either for our souls 
<A NAME="750"></A>or bodies, or for the actions which they perform. For no one who is asleep 
<A NAME="751"></A>is good for anything, any more than if he were dead; but he of us who has 
<A NAME="752"></A>the most regard for life and reason keeps awake as long he can, reserving 
<A NAME="753"></A>only so much time for sleep as is expedient for health; and much sleep 
<A NAME="754"></A>is not required, if the habit of moderation be once rightly formed. Magistrates 
<A NAME="755"></A>in states who keep awake at night are terrible to the bad, whether enemies 
<A NAME="756"></A>or citizens, and are honoured and reverenced by the just and temperate, 
<A NAME="757"></A>and are useful to themselves and to the whole state.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR>A night which is passed in such a manner, in addition to all the 
<A NAME="759"></A>above-mentioned advantages, infuses a sort of courage into the minds of 
<A NAME="760"></A>the citizens. When the day breaks, the time has arrived for youth to go 
<A NAME="761"></A>to their schoolmasters. Now neither sheep nor any other animals can live 
<A NAME="762"></A>without a shepherd, nor can children be left without tutors, or slaves 
<A NAME="763"></A>without masters. And of all animals the boy is the most unmanageable, inasmuch 
<A NAME="764"></A>as he has the fountain of reason in him not yet regulated; he is the most 
<A NAME="765"></A>insidious, sharp-witted, and insubordinate of animals. Wherefore he must 
<A NAME="766"></A>be bound with many bridles; in the first place, when he gets away from 
<A NAME="767"></A>mothers and nurses, he must be under the management of tutors on account 
<A NAME="768"></A>of his childishness and foolishness; then, again, being a freeman, he must 
<A NAME="769"></A>be controlled by teachers, no matter what they teach, and by studies; but 
<A NAME="770"></A>he is also a slave, and in that regard any freeman who comes in his way 
<A NAME="771"></A>may punish him and his tutor and his instructor, if any of them does anything 
<A NAME="772"></A>wrong; and he who comes across him and does not inflict upon him the punishment 
<A NAME="773"></A>which he deserves, shall incur the greatest disgrace; and let the guardian 
<A NAME="774"></A>of the law, who is the director of education, see to him who coming in 
<A NAME="775"></A>the way of the offences which we have mentioned, does not chastise them 
<A NAME="776"></A>when he ought, or chastises them in a way which he ought not; let him keep 
<A NAME="777"></A>a sharp look-out, and take especial care of the training of our children, 
<A NAME="778"></A>directing their natures, and always turning them to good according to the 
<A NAME="779"></A>law.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR><BR>But how can our law sufficiently train the director of education. 
<A NAME="781"></A>himself; for as yet all has been imperfect, and nothing has been said either 
<A NAME="782"></A>clear or satisfactory? Now, as far as possible, the law ought to leave 
<A NAME="783"></A>nothing to him, but to explain everything, that he may be an interpreter 
<A NAME="784"></A>and tutor to others. About dances and music and choral strains, I have 
<A NAME="785"></A>already spoken both to the character of the selection of them, and the 
<A NAME="786"></A>manner in which they are to be amended and consecrated. But we have not 
<A NAME="787"></A>as yet spoken, O illustrious guardian of education, of the manner in which 
<A NAME="788"></A>your pupils are to use those strains which are written in prose, although 
<A NAME="789"></A>you have been informed what martial strains they are to learn and practise; 
<A NAME="790"></A>what relates in the first place to the learning of letters, and secondly, 
<A NAME="791"></A>to the lyre, and also to calculation, which, as we were saying, is needful 
<A NAME="792"></A>for them all to learn, and any other things which are required with a view 
<A NAME="793"></A>to war and the management of house and city, and, looking to the same object, 
<A NAME="794"></A>what is useful in the revolutions of the heavenly bodies-the stars and 
<A NAME="795"></A>sun and moon, and the various regulations about these matters which are 
<A NAME="796"></A>necessary for the whole state-I am speaking of the arrangements of; days 
<A NAME="797"></A>in periods of months, and of months in years, which are to be observed, 
<A NAME="798"></A>in order that seasons and sacrifices and festivals may have their regular 
<A NAME="799"></A>and natural order, and keep the city alive and awake, the Gods receiving 
<A NAME="800"></A>the honours due to them, and men having a better understanding about them: 
<A NAME="801"></A>all these things, O my friend, have not yet been sufficiently declared 
<A NAME="802"></A>to you by the legislator. Attend, then, to what I am now going to say:-We 
<A NAME="803"></A>were telling you, in the first place, that you were not sufficiently informed 
<A NAME="804"></A>about letters, and the objection was to this effect-that you were never 
<A NAME="805"></A>told whether he who was meant to be a respectable citizen should apply 
<A NAME="806"></A>himself in detail to that sort of learning, or not apply himself at all; 
<A NAME="807"></A>and the same remark holds good of the study of the lyre. But now we say 
<A NAME="808"></A>that he ought to attend to them. A fair time for a boy of ten years old 
<A NAME="809"></A>to spend in letters is three years; the age of thirteen is the proper time 
<A NAME="810"></A>for him to begin to handle the lyre, and he may continue at this for another 
<A NAME="811"></A>three years, neither more nor less, and whether his father or himself like 
<A NAME="812"></A>or dislike the study, he is not to be allowed to spend more or less time 
<A NAME="813"></A>in learning music than the law allows. And let him who disobeys the law 
<A NAME="814"></A>be deprived of those youthful honours of which we shall hereafter speak. 
<A NAME="815"></A>Hear, however, first of all, what the young ought to learn in the early 
<A NAME="816"></A>years of life, and what their instructors ought to teach them. They ought 
<A NAME="817"></A>to be occupied with their letters until they are to read and write; but 
<A NAME="818"></A>the acquisition of perfect beauty or quickness in writinig, if nature has 
<A NAME="819"></A>not stimulated them to acquire these accomplishments in the given number 
<A NAME="820"></A>of years, they should let alone. And as to the learning of compositions 
<A NAME="821"></A>committed to writing which are not set to the lyre, whether metrical or 
<A NAME="822"></A>without rhythmical divisions, compositions in prose, as they are termed, 
<A NAME="823"></A>having no rhythm or harmony-seeing how dangerous are the writings handed 
<A NAME="824"></A>down to us by many writers of this class-what will you do with them, O 
<A NAME="825"></A>most excellent guardians of the law? or how can the lawgiver rightly direct 
<A NAME="826"></A>you about them? I believe that he will be in great difficulty.
<A NAME="827"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What troubles you, Stranger? and why are you so perplexed 
<A NAME="828"></A>in your mind?
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> You naturally ask, Cleinias, and to you and Megillus, 
<A NAME="830"></A>who are my partners in the work of legislation, I must state the more difficult 
<A NAME="831"></A>as well as the easier parts of the task.
<A NAME="832"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To what do you refer in this instance?
<A NAME="833"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I will tell you. There is a difficulty in opposing many 
<A NAME="834"></A>myriads of mouths.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Well, and have we not already opposed the popular voice 
<A NAME="836"></A>in many important enactments?
<A NAME="837"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> That is quite true; and you mean to imply, that the 
<A NAME="838"></A>road which we are taking may be disagreeable to some but is agreeable to 
<A NAME="839"></A>as many others, or if not to as many, at any rate to persons not inferior 
<A NAME="840"></A>to the others, and in company with them you bid me, at whatever risk, to 
<A NAME="841"></A>proceed along the path of legislation which has opened out of our present 
<A NAME="842"></A>discourse, and to be of good cheer, and not to faint.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And I do not faint; I say, indeed, that we have a great 
<A NAME="845"></A>many poets writing in hexameter, trimeter, and all sorts of measures-some 
<A NAME="846"></A>who are serious, others who aim only at raising a laugh-and all mankind 
<A NAME="847"></A>declare that the youth who are rightly educated should be brought up in 
<A NAME="848"></A>them and saturated with them; some insist that they should be constantly 
<A NAME="849"></A>hearing them read aloud, and always learning them, so as to get by heart 
<A NAME="850"></A>entire poets; while others select choice passages and long speeches, and 
<A NAME="851"></A>make compendiums of them, saying that these ought to be committed to memory, 
<A NAME="852"></A>if a man is to be made good and wise by experience and learning of many 
<A NAME="853"></A>things. And you want me now to tell them plainly in what they are right 
<A NAME="854"></A>and in what they are wrong.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes, I do. Ath. But how can I in one word rightly comprehend 
<A NAME="856"></A>all of them? I am of opinion, and, if I am not mistaken, there is a general 
<A NAME="857"></A>agreement, that every one of these poets has said many things well and 
<A NAME="858"></A>many things the reverse of well; and if this be true, then I do affirm 
<A NAME="859"></A>that much learning is dangerous to youth.
<A NAME="860"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How would you advise the guardian of the law to 
<A NAME="861"></A>act?
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In what respect?
<A NAME="863"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> I mean to what pattern should he look as his guide in permitting 
<A NAME="864"></A>the young to learn some things and forbidding them to learn others. Do 
<A NAME="865"></A>not shrink from answering.
<A NAME="866"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> My good Cleinias, I rather think that I am 
<A NAME="867"></A>fortunate.
<A NAME="868"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> How so?
<A NAME="869"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I think that I am not wholly in want of a pattern, for 
<A NAME="870"></A>when I consider the words which we have spoken from early dawn until now, 
<A NAME="871"></A>and which, as I believe, have been inspired by Heaven, they appear to me 
<A NAME="872"></A>to be quite like a poem. When I reflected upon all these words of ours. 
<A NAME="873"></A>I naturally felt pleasure, for of all the discourses which I have ever 
<A NAME="874"></A>learnt or heard, either in poetry or prose, this seemed to me to be the 
<A NAME="875"></A>justest, and most suitable for young men to hear; I cannot imagine any 
<A NAME="876"></A>better pattern than this which the guardian of the law who is also the 
<A NAME="877"></A>director of education can have. He cannot do better than advise the teachers 
<A NAME="878"></A>to teach the young these words and any which are of a like nature, if he 
<A NAME="879"></A>should happen to find them, either in poetry or prose, or if he come across 
<A NAME="880"></A>unwritten discourses akin to ours, he should certainly preserve them, and 
<A NAME="881"></A>commit them to writing. And, first of all, he shall constrain the teachers 
<A NAME="882"></A>themselves to learn and approve them, and any of them who will not, shall 
<A NAME="883"></A>not be employed by him, but those whom he finds agreeing in his judgment, 
<A NAME="884"></A>he shall make use of and shall commit to them the instruction and education 
<A NAME="885"></A>of youth. And here and on this wise let my fanciful tale about letters 
<A NAME="886"></A>and teachers of letters come to an end.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I do not think, Stranger, that we have wandered out 
<A NAME="888"></A>of the proposed limits of the argument; but whether we are right or not 
<A NAME="889"></A>in our whole conception, I cannot be very certain.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> The truth, Cleinias, may be expected to become clearer 
<A NAME="891"></A>when, as we have often said, we arrive at the end of the whole discussion 
<A NAME="892"></A>about laws.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And now that we have done with the teacher of letters, 
<A NAME="895"></A>the teacher of the lyre has to receive orders from us.
<A NAME="896"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="897"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I think that we have only to recollect our previous discussions, 
<A NAME="898"></A>and we shall be able to give suitable regulations touching all this part 
<A NAME="899"></A>of instruction and education to the teachers of the 
<A NAME="900"></A>lyre.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To what do you refer?
<A NAME="902"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> We were saying, if I remember rightly, that the sixty-year-old 
<A NAME="903"></A>choristers of Dionysus were to be specially quick in their perceptions 
<A NAME="904"></A>of rhythm and musical composition, that they might be able to distinguish 
<A NAME="905"></A>good and bad imitation, that is to say, the imitation of the good or bad 
<A NAME="906"></A>soul when under the influence of passion, rejecting the one and displaying 
<A NAME="907"></A>the other in hymns and songs, charming the souls of youth, and inviting 
<A NAME="908"></A>them to follow and attain virtue by the way of imitation.
<A NAME="909"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And with this view, the teacher and the learner ought to 
<A NAME="911"></A>use the sounds of the lyre, because its notes are pure, the player who 
<A NAME="912"></A>teaches and his pupil rendering note for note in unison; but complexity, 
<A NAME="913"></A>and variation of notes, when the strings give one sound and the poet or 
<A NAME="914"></A>composer of the melody gives another-also when they make concords and harmonies 
<A NAME="915"></A>in which lesser and greater intervals, slow and quick, or high and low 
<A NAME="916"></A>notes, are combined-or, again, when they make complex variations of rhythms, 
<A NAME="917"></A>which they adapt to the notes of the lyre-all that sort of thing is not 
<A NAME="918"></A>suited to those who have to acquire a speedy and useful knowledge of music 
<A NAME="919"></A>in three years; for opposite principles are confusing, and create a difficulty 
<A NAME="920"></A>in learning, and our young men should learn quickly, and their mere necessary 
<A NAME="921"></A>acquirements are not few or trifling, as will be shown in due course. Let 
<A NAME="922"></A>the director of education attend to the principles concerning music which 
<A NAME="923"></A>we are laying down. As to the songs and words themselves which the masters 
<A NAME="924"></A>of choruses are to teach and the character of them, they have been already 
<A NAME="925"></A>described by us, and are the same which, when consecrated and adapted to 
<A NAME="926"></A>the different festivals, we said were to benefit cities by affording them 
<A NAME="927"></A>an innocent amusement.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That, again, is true.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then let him who has been elected a director of music receive 
<A NAME="930"></A>these rules from us as containing the very truth; and may he prosper in 
<A NAME="931"></A>his office! Let us now proceed to lay down other rules in addition to the 
<A NAME="932"></A>preceding about dancing and gymnastic exercise in general. Having said 
<A NAME="933"></A>what remained to be said about the teaching of music, let us speak in like 
<A NAME="934"></A>manner about gymnastic. For boys and girls ought to learn to dance and 
<A NAME="935"></A>practise gymnastic exercises-ought they not?
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then the boys ought to have dancing masters, and the girls 
<A NAME="938"></A>dancing mistresses to exercise them.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then once more let us summon him who has the chief concern 
<A NAME="941"></A>in the business, the superintendent of youth [i.e., the director of education]; 
<A NAME="942"></A>he will have plenty to do, if he is to have the charge of music and 
<A NAME="943"></A>gymnastic.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> But how will old man be able to attend to such great 
<A NAME="945"></A>charges?
<A NAME="946"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> O my friend, there will be no difficulty, for the law has 
<A NAME="947"></A>already given and will give him permission to select as his assistants 
<A NAME="948"></A>in this charge any citizens, male or female, whom he desires; and he will 
<A NAME="949"></A>know whom he ought to choose, and will be anxious not to make a mistake, 
<A NAME="950"></A>from a due sense of responsibility, and from a consciousness of the importance 
<A NAME="951"></A>of his office, and also because he will consider that if young men have 
<A NAME="952"></A>been and are well brought up, then all things go swimmingly, but if not, 
<A NAME="953"></A>it is not meet to say, nor do we say, what will follow, lest the regarders 
<A NAME="954"></A>of omens should take alarm about our infant state. Many things have been 
<A NAME="955"></A>said by us about dancing and about gymnastic movements in general; for 
<A NAME="956"></A>we include under gymnastics all military exercises, such as archery, and 
<A NAME="957"></A>all hurling of weapons, and the use of the light shield, and all fighting 
<A NAME="958"></A>with heavy arms, and military evolutions, and movements of armies, and 
<A NAME="959"></A>encampings, and all that relates to horsemanship. Of all these things there 
<A NAME="960"></A>ought to be public teachers, receiving pay from the state, and their pupils 
<A NAME="961"></A>should be the men and boys in the state, and also the girls and women, 
<A NAME="962"></A>who are to know all these things. While they are yet girls they should 
<A NAME="963"></A>have practised dancing in arms and the whole art of fighting-when grown-up 
<A NAME="964"></A>women, they should apply themselves to evolutions and tactics, and the 
<A NAME="965"></A>mode of grounding and taking up arms; if for no other reason, yet in case 
<A NAME="966"></A>the whole military force should have to leave the city and carry on operations 
<A NAME="967"></A>of war outside, that those who will have to guard the young and the rest 
<A NAME="968"></A>of the city may be equal to the task; and, on the other hand, when enemies, 
<A NAME="969"></A>whether barbarian or Hellenic, come from without with mighty force and 
<A NAME="970"></A>make a violent assault upon them, and thus compel them to fight for the 
<A NAME="971"></A>possession of the city, which is far from being an impossibility, great 
<A NAME="972"></A>would be the disgrace to the state, if the women had been so miserably 
<A NAME="973"></A>trained that they could not fight for their young, as birds will, against 
<A NAME="974"></A>any creature however strong, and die or undergo any danger, but must instantly 
<A NAME="975"></A>rush to the temples and crowd at the altars and shrines, and bring upon 
<A NAME="976"></A>human nature the reproach, that of all animals man is the most 
<A NAME="977"></A>cowardly!
<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Such a want of education, Stranger, is certainly an 
<A NAME="979"></A>unseemly thing to happen in a state, as well as a great 
<A NAME="980"></A>misfortune.
<A NAME="981"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Suppose that we carry our law to the extent of saying 
<A NAME="982"></A>that women ought not to neglect military matters, but that all citizens, 
<A NAME="983"></A>male and female alike, shall attend to them?
<A NAME="984"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I quite agree.
<A NAME="985"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Of wrestling we have spoken in part, but of what I should 
<A NAME="986"></A>call the most important part we have not spoken, and cannot easily speak 
<A NAME="987"></A>without showing at the same time by gesture as well as in word what we 
<A NAME="988"></A>mean; when word and action combine, and not till then, we shall explain 
<A NAME="989"></A>clearly what has been said, pointing out that of all movements wrestling 
<A NAME="990"></A>is most akin to the military art, and is to be pursued for the sake of 
<A NAME="991"></A>this, and not this for the sake of wrestling.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Excellent.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Enough of wrestling; we will now proceed to speak of other 
<A NAME="994"></A>movements of the body. Such motion may be in general called dancing, and 
<A NAME="995"></A>is of two kinds: one of nobler figures, imitating the honourable, the other 
<A NAME="996"></A>of the more ignoble figures, imitating the mean; and of both these there 
<A NAME="997"></A>are two further subdivisions. Of the serious, one kind is of those engaged 
<A NAME="998"></A>in war and vehement action, and is the exercise of a noble person and a 
<A NAME="999"></A>manly heart; the other exhibits a temperate soul in the enjoyment of prosperity 
<A NAME="1000"></A>and modest pleasures, and may be truly called and is the dance of peace. 
<A NAME="1001"></A>The warrior dance is different from the peaceful one, and may be rightly 
<A NAME="1002"></A>termed Pyrrhic; this imitates the modes of avoiding blows and missiles 
<A NAME="1003"></A>by dropping or giving way, or springing aside, or rising up or falling 
<A NAME="1004"></A>down; also the opposite postures which are those of action, as, for example, 
<A NAME="1005"></A>the imitation of archery and the hurling of javelins, and of all sorts 
<A NAME="1006"></A>of blows. And when the imitation is of brave bodies and souls, and the 
<A NAME="1007"></A>action is direct and muscular, giving for the most part a straight movement 
<A NAME="1008"></A>to the limbs of the body-that, I say, is the true sort; but the opposite 
<A NAME="1009"></A>is not right. In the dance of peace what we have to consider is whether 
<A NAME="1010"></A>a man bears himself naturally and gracefully, and after the manner of men 
<A NAME="1011"></A>who duly conform to the law. But before proceeding I must distinguish the 
<A NAME="1012"></A>dancing about which there is any doubt, from that about which there is 
<A NAME="1013"></A>no doubt. Which is the doubtful kind, and how are the two to be distinguished? 
<A NAME="1014"></A>There are dances of the Bacchic sort, both those in which, as they say, 
<A NAME="1015"></A>they imitate drunken men, and which are named after the Nymphs, and Pan, 
<A NAME="1016"></A>and Silenuses, and Satyrs; and also those in which purifications are made 
<A NAME="1017"></A>or mysteries celebrated-all this sort of dancing cannot be rightly defined 
<A NAME="1018"></A>as having either a peaceful or a warlike character, or indeed as having 
<A NAME="1019"></A>any meaning whatever and may, I think, be most truly described as distinct 
<A NAME="1020"></A>from the warlike dance, and distinct from the peaceful, and not suited 
<A NAME="1021"></A>for a city at all. There let it lie; and so leaving it to lie, we will 
<A NAME="1022"></A>proceed to the dances of war and peace, for with these we are undoubtedly 
<A NAME="1023"></A>concerned. Now the unwarlike muse, which honours in dance the Gods and 
<A NAME="1024"></A>the sons of the Gods, is entirely associated with the consciousness of 
<A NAME="1025"></A>prosperity; this class may be subdivided into two lesser classes, of which 
<A NAME="1026"></A>one is expressive of an escape from some labour or danger into good, and 
<A NAME="1027"></A>has greater pleasures, the other expressive of preservation and increase 
<A NAME="1028"></A>of former good, in which the pleasure is less exciting;-in all these cases, 
<A NAME="1029"></A>every man when the pleasure is greater, moves his body more, and less when 
<A NAME="1030"></A>the pleasure is less; and, again, if he be more orderly and has learned 
<A NAME="1031"></A>courage from discipline he waves less, but if he be a coward, and has no 
<A NAME="1032"></A>training or self-control, he makes greater and more violent movements, 
<A NAME="1033"></A>and in general when he is speaking or singing he is not altogether able 
<A NAME="1034"></A>to keep his body still; and so out of the imitation of words in gestures 
<A NAME="1035"></A>the whole art of dancing has arisen. And in these various kinds of imitation 
<A NAME="1036"></A>one man moves in an orderly, another in a disorderly manner; and as the 
<A NAME="1037"></A>ancients may be observed to have given many names which are according to 
<A NAME="1038"></A>nature and deserving of praise, so there is an excellent one which they 
<A NAME="1039"></A>have given to the dances of men who in their times of prosperity are moderate 
<A NAME="1040"></A>in their pleasures-the giver of names, whoever he was, assigned to them 
<A NAME="1041"></A>a very true, and poetical, and rational name, when he called them Emmeleiai, 
<A NAME="1042"></A>or dances of order, thus establishing two kinds of dances of the nobler 
<A NAME="1043"></A>sort, the dance of war which he called the Pyrrhic, and the dance of peace 
<A NAME="1044"></A>which he called Emmeleia, or the dance of order; giving to each their appropriate 
<A NAME="1045"></A>and becoming name. These things the legislator should indicate in general 
<A NAME="1046"></A>outline, and the guardian of the law should enquire into them and search 
<A NAME="1047"></A>them out, combining dancing with music, and assigning to the several sacrificial 
<A NAME="1048"></A>feasts that which is suitable to them; and when he has consecrated all 
<A NAME="1049"></A>of them in due order, he shall for the future change nothing, whether of 
<A NAME="1050"></A>dance or song. Thenceforward the city and the citizens shall continue to 
<A NAME="1051"></A>have the same pleasures, themselves being as far as possible alike, and 
<A NAME="1052"></A>shall live well and happily.
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR><BR>I have described the dances which are appropriate to noble bodies 
<A NAME="1054"></A>and generous souls. But it is necessary also to consider and know uncomely 
<A NAME="1055"></A>persons and thoughts, and those which are intended to produce laughter 
<A NAME="1056"></A>in comedy, and have a comic character in respect of style, song, and dance, 
<A NAME="1057"></A>and of the imitations which these afford. For serious things cannot be 
<A NAME="1058"></A>understood without laughable things, nor opposites at all without opposites, 
<A NAME="1059"></A>if a man is really to have intelligence of either; but he can not carry 
<A NAME="1060"></A>out both in action, if he is to have any degree of virtue. And for this 
<A NAME="1061"></A>very reason he should learn them both, in order that he may not in ignorance 
<A NAME="1062"></A>do or say anything which is ridiculous and out of place-he should command 
<A NAME="1063"></A>slaves and hired strangers to imitate such things, but he should never 
<A NAME="1064"></A>take any serious interest in them himself, nor should any freeman or freewoman 
<A NAME="1065"></A>be discovered taking pains to learn them; and there should always be some 
<A NAME="1066"></A>element of novelty in the imitation. Let these then be laid down, both 
<A NAME="1067"></A>in law and in our discourse, as the regulations of laughable amusements 
<A NAME="1068"></A>which are generally called comedy. And, if any of the serious poets, as 
<A NAME="1069"></A>they are termed, who write tragedy, come to us and say-"O strangers, may 
<A NAME="1070"></A>we go to your city and country or may we not, and shall we bring with us 
<A NAME="1071"></A>our poetry-what is your will about these matters?"-how shall we answer 
<A NAME="1072"></A>the divine men? I think that our answer should be as follows:-Best of strangers, 
<A NAME="1073"></A>we will say to them, we also according to our ability are tragic poets, 
<A NAME="1074"></A>and our tragedy is the best and noblest; for our whole state is an imitation 
<A NAME="1075"></A>of the best and noblest life, which we affirm to be indeed the very truth 
<A NAME="1076"></A>of tragedy. You are poets and we are poets, both makers of the same strains, 
<A NAME="1077"></A>rivals and antagonists in the noblest of dramas, which true law can alone 
<A NAME="1078"></A>perfect, as our hope is. Do not then suppose that we shall all in a moment 
<A NAME="1079"></A>allow you to erect your stage in the agora, or introduce the fair voices 
<A NAME="1080"></A>of your actors, speaking above our own, and permit you to harangue our 
<A NAME="1081"></A>women and children, and the common people, about our institutions, in language 
<A NAME="1082"></A>other than our own, and very often the opposite of our own. For a state 
<A NAME="1083"></A>would be mad which gave you this licence, until the magistrates had determined 
<A NAME="1084"></A>whether your poetry might be recited, and was fit for publication or not. 
<A NAME="1085"></A>Wherefore, O ye sons and scions of the softer Muses, first of all show 
<A NAME="1086"></A>your songs to the magistrates, and let them compare them with our own, 
<A NAME="1087"></A>and if they are the same or better we will give you a chorus; but if not, 
<A NAME="1088"></A>then, my friends, we cannot. Let these, then, be the customs ordained by 
<A NAME="1089"></A>law about all dances and the teaching of them, and let matters relating 
<A NAME="1090"></A>to slaves be separated from those relating to masters, if you do not 
<A NAME="1091"></A>object.
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> We can have no hesitation in assenting when you put 
<A NAME="1093"></A>the matter thus.
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> There still remain three studies suitable for freemen. 
<A NAME="1095"></A>Arithmetic is one of them; the measurement of length, surface, and depth 
<A NAME="1096"></A>is the second; and the third has to do with the revolutions of the stars 
<A NAME="1097"></A>in relation to one another. Not every one has need to toil through all 
<A NAME="1098"></A>these things in a strictly scientific manner, but only a few, and who they 
<A NAME="1099"></A>are to be we will hereafter indicate at the end, which will be the proper 
<A NAME="1100"></A>place; not to know what is necessary for mankind in general, and what is 
<A NAME="1101"></A>the truth, is disgraceful to every one: and yet to enter into these matters 
<A NAME="1102"></A>minutely is neither easy, nor at all possible for every one; but there 
<A NAME="1103"></A>is something in them which is necessary and cannot be set aside, and probably 
<A NAME="1104"></A>he who made the proverb about God originally had this in view when he said, 
<A NAME="1105"></A>that "not even God himself can fight against necessity";-he meant, if I 
<A NAME="1106"></A>am not mistaken, divine necessity; for as to the human necessities of which 
<A NAME="1107"></A>the many speak, when they talk in this manner, nothing can be more ridiculous 
<A NAME="1108"></A>than such an application of the words.
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> And what necessities of knowledge are there, Stranger, 
<A NAME="1110"></A>which are divine and not human?
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> I conceive them to be those of which he who has no 
<A NAME="1112"></A>use nor any knowledge at all cannot be a God, or demi-god, or hero to mankind, 
<A NAME="1113"></A>or able to take any serious thought or charge of them. And very unlike 
<A NAME="1114"></A>a divine man would he be, who is unable to count one, two, three, or to 
<A NAME="1115"></A>distinguish odd and even numbers, or is unable to count at all, or reckon 
<A NAME="1116"></A>night and day, and who is totally unacquainted with the revolution of the 
<A NAME="1117"></A>sun and moon, and the other stars. There would be great folly in supposing 
<A NAME="1118"></A>that all these are not necessary parts of knowledge to him who intends 
<A NAME="1119"></A>to know anything about the highest kinds of knowledge; but which these 
<A NAME="1120"></A>are, and how many there are of them, and when they are to be learned, and 
<A NAME="1121"></A>what is to be learned together and what apart, and the whole correlation 
<A NAME="1122"></A>of them, must be rightly apprehended first; and these leading the way we 
<A NAME="1123"></A>may proceed to the other parts of knowledge. For so necessity grounded 
<A NAME="1124"></A>in nature constrains us, against which we say that no God contends, or 
<A NAME="1125"></A>ever will contend.

<A NAME="1127"></A>true and agreeable to nature.
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes, Cleinias, that is so. But it is difficult for 
<A NAME="1129"></A>the legislator to begin with these studies; at a more convenient time we 
<A NAME="1130"></A>will make regulations for them.
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> You seem, Stranger, to be afraid of our habitual ignorance 
<A NAME="1132"></A>of the subject: there is no reason why that should prevent you from speaking 
<A NAME="1133"></A>out.
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> I certainly am afraid of the difficulties to which 
<A NAME="1135"></A>you allude, but I am still more afraid of those who apply themselves to 
<A NAME="1136"></A>this sort of knowledge, and apply themselves badly. For entire ignorance 
<A NAME="1137"></A>is not so terrible or extreme an evil, and is far from being the greatest 
<A NAME="1138"></A>of all; too much cleverness and too much learning, accompanied with an 
<A NAME="1139"></A>ill bringing up, are far more fatal.
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> All freemen, I conceive, should learn as much of these 
<A NAME="1142"></A>branches of knowledge as every child in Egypt is taught when he learns 
<A NAME="1143"></A>the alphabet. In that country arithmetical games have been invented for 
<A NAME="1144"></A>the use of mere children, which they learn as a pleasure and amusement.
