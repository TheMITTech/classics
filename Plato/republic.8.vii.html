<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Socrates - GLAUCON
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>And now, I said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is 
<A NAME="12"></A>enlightened or unenlightened: --Behold! human beings living in a underground 
<A NAME="13"></A>den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the 
<A NAME="14"></A>den; here they have been from their childhood, and have their legs and 
<A NAME="15"></A>necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see before them, being 
<A NAME="16"></A>prevented by the chains from turning round their heads. Above and behind 
<A NAME="17"></A>them a fire is blazing at a distance, and between the fire and the prisoners 
<A NAME="18"></A>there is a raised way; and you will see, if you look, a low wall built 
<A NAME="19"></A>along the way, like the screen which marionette players have in front of 
<A NAME="20"></A>them, over which they show the puppets.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>I see.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>And do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying all sorts 

<A NAME="23"></A>of vessels, and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone and 
<A NAME="24"></A>various materials, which appear over the wall? Some of them are talking, 
<A NAME="25"></A>others silent.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>You have shown me a strange image, and they are strange 
<A NAME="27"></A>prisoners.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Like ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or 
<A NAME="29"></A>the shadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite wall 
<A NAME="30"></A>of the cave?
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>True, he said; how could they see anything but the shadows if they 
<A NAME="32"></A>were never allowed to move their heads?
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they 
<A NAME="34"></A>would only see the shadows?
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>And if they were able to converse with one another, would they not 
<A NAME="37"></A>suppose that they were naming what was actually before 
<A NAME="38"></A>them?
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>Very true.

<A NAME="40"></A><BR>And suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the 
<A NAME="41"></A>other side, would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers-by 
<A NAME="42"></A>spoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing 
<A NAME="43"></A>shadow?
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>No question, he replied.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>To them, I said, the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows 
<A NAME="46"></A>of the images.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>That is certain.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>And now look again, and see what will naturally follow it' the prisoners 
<A NAME="49"></A>are released and disabused of their error. At first, when any of them is 
<A NAME="50"></A>liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and 
<A NAME="51"></A>walk and look towards the light, he will suffer sharp pains; the glare 
<A NAME="52"></A>will distress him, and he will be unable to see the realities of which 
<A NAME="53"></A>in his former state he had seen the shadows; and then conceive some one 
<A NAME="54"></A>saying to him, that what he saw before was an illusion, but that now, when 
<A NAME="55"></A>he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned towards more real 
<A NAME="56"></A>existence, he has a clearer vision, -what will be his reply? And you may 

<A NAME="57"></A>further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they 
<A NAME="58"></A>pass and requiring him to name them, -will he not be perplexed? Will he 
<A NAME="59"></A>not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects 
<A NAME="60"></A>which are now shown to him?
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>Far truer.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have 
<A NAME="63"></A>a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take and take in the 
<A NAME="64"></A>objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be in 
<A NAME="65"></A>reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to 
<A NAME="66"></A>him?
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>True, he now
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>And suppose once more, that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and 
<A NAME="69"></A>rugged ascent, and held fast until he 's forced into the presence of the 
<A NAME="70"></A>sun himself, is he not likely to be pained and irritated? When he approaches 
<A NAME="71"></A>the light his eyes will be dazzled, and he will not be able to see anything 
<A NAME="72"></A>at all of what are now called realities.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Not all in a moment, he said.

<A NAME="74"></A><BR>He will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper world. 
<A NAME="75"></A>And first he will see the shadows best, next the reflections of men and 
<A NAME="76"></A>other objects in the water, and then the objects themselves; then he will 
<A NAME="77"></A>gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled heaven; 
<A NAME="78"></A>and he will see the sky and the stars by night better than the sun or the 
<A NAME="79"></A>light of the sun by day?
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Last of he will be able to see the sun, and not mere reflections of 
<A NAME="82"></A>him in the water, but he will see him in his own proper place, and not 
<A NAME="83"></A>in another; and he will contemplate him as he is.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>He will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season 
<A NAME="86"></A>and the years, and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world, 
<A NAME="87"></A>and in a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have 
<A NAME="88"></A>been accustomed to behold?
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>Clearly, he said, he would first see the sun and then reason about 
<A NAME="90"></A>him.

<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>And when he remembered his old habitation, and the wisdom of the 
<A NAME="92"></A>den and his fellow-prisoners, do you not suppose that he would felicitate 
<A NAME="93"></A>himself on the change, and pity them?
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he would.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>And if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves 
<A NAME="96"></A>on those who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark 
<A NAME="97"></A>which of them went before, and which followed after, and which were together; 
<A NAME="98"></A>and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as to the future, 
<A NAME="99"></A>do you think that he would care for such honours and glories, or envy the 
<A NAME="100"></A>possessors of them? Would he not say with Homer,
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>Better to be the poor servant of a poor master, and to endure anything, 
<A NAME="102"></A>rather than think as they do and live after their manner?
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, I think that he would rather suffer anything than 
<A NAME="104"></A>entertain these false notions and live in this miserable 
<A NAME="105"></A>manner.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>Imagine once more, I said, such an one coming suddenly out of the 
<A NAME="107"></A>sun to be replaced in his old situation; would he not be certain to have 

<A NAME="108"></A>his eyes full of darkness?
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>To be sure, he said.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>And if there were a contest, and he had to compete in measuring the 
<A NAME="111"></A>shadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den, while his 
<A NAME="112"></A>sight was still weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and the time 
<A NAME="113"></A>which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be very 
<A NAME="114"></A>considerable) would he not be ridiculous? Men would say of him that up 
<A NAME="115"></A>he went and down he came without his eyes; and that it was better not even 
<A NAME="116"></A>to think of ascending; and if any one tried to loose another and lead him 
<A NAME="117"></A>up to the light, let them only catch the offender, and they would put him 
<A NAME="118"></A>to death.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>No question, he said.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>This entire allegory, I said, you may now append, dear Glaucon, to 
<A NAME="121"></A>the previous argument; the prison-house is the world of sight, the light 
<A NAME="122"></A>of the fire is the sun, and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret 
<A NAME="123"></A>the journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual 
<A NAME="124"></A>world according to my poor belief, which, at your desire, I have expressed 

<A NAME="125"></A>whether rightly or wrongly God knows. But, whether true or false, my opinion 
<A NAME="126"></A>is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all, 
<A NAME="127"></A>and is seen only with an effort; and, when seen, is also inferred to be 
<A NAME="128"></A>the universal author of all things beautiful and right, parent of light 
<A NAME="129"></A>and of the lord of light in this visible world, and the immediate source 
<A NAME="130"></A>of reason and truth in the intellectual; and that this is the power upon 
<A NAME="131"></A>which he who would act rationally, either in public or private life must 
<A NAME="132"></A>have his eye fixed.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>I agree, he said, as far as I am able to understand 
<A NAME="134"></A>you.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Moreover, I said, you must not wonder that those who attain to this 
<A NAME="136"></A>beatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs; for their souls 
<A NAME="137"></A>are ever hastening into the upper world where they desire to dwell; which 
<A NAME="138"></A>desire of theirs is very natural, if our allegory may be 
<A NAME="139"></A>trusted.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>Yes, very natural.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>And is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine contemplations 

<A NAME="142"></A>to the evil state of man, misbehaving himself in a ridiculous manner; if, 
<A NAME="143"></A>while his eyes are blinking and before he has become accustomed to the 
<A NAME="144"></A>surrounding darkness, he is compelled to fight in courts of law, or in 
<A NAME="145"></A>other places, about the images or the shadows of images of justice, and 
<A NAME="146"></A>is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of those who have never yet seen 
<A NAME="147"></A>absolute justice?
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>Anything but surprising, he replied.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of 
<A NAME="150"></A>the eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming 
<A NAME="151"></A>out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the mind's 
<A NAME="152"></A>eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who remembers this when 
<A NAME="153"></A>he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too ready 
<A NAME="154"></A>to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the 
<A NAME="155"></A>brighter light, and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark, 
<A NAME="156"></A>or having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light. 
<A NAME="157"></A>And he will count the one happy in his condition and state of being, and 
<A NAME="158"></A>he will pity the other; or, if he have a mind to laugh at the soul which 

<A NAME="159"></A>comes from below into the light, there will be more reason in this than 
<A NAME="160"></A>in the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of the light into 
<A NAME="161"></A>the den.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>That, he said, is a very just distinction.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>But then, if I am right, certain professors of education must be wrong 
<A NAME="164"></A>when they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was not 
<A NAME="165"></A>there before, like sight into blind eyes.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>They undoubtedly say this, he replied.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>Whereas, our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning 
<A NAME="168"></A>exists in the soul already; and that just as the eye was unable to turn 
<A NAME="169"></A>from darkness to light without the whole body, so too the instrument of 
<A NAME="170"></A>knowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the 
<A NAME="171"></A>world of becoming into that of being, and learn by degrees to endure the 
<A NAME="172"></A>sight of being, and of the brightest and best of being, or in other words, 
<A NAME="173"></A>of the good.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>And must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the 

<A NAME="176"></A>easiest and quickest manner; not implanting the faculty of sight, for that 
<A NAME="177"></A>exists already, but has been turned in the wrong direction, and is looking 
<A NAME="178"></A>away from the truth?
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, such an art may be presumed.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>And whereas the other so-called virtues of the soul seem to be akin 
<A NAME="181"></A>to bodily qualities, for even when they are not originally innate they 
<A NAME="182"></A>can be implanted later by habit and exercise, the of wisdom more than anything 
<A NAME="183"></A>else contains a divine element which always remains, and by this conversion 
<A NAME="184"></A>is rendered useful and profitable; or, on the other hand, hurtful and useless. 
<A NAME="185"></A>Did you never observe the narrow intelligence flashing from the keen eye 
<A NAME="186"></A>of a clever rogue --how eager he is, how clearly his paltry soul sees the 
<A NAME="187"></A>way to his end; he is the reverse of blind, but his keen eyesight is forced 
<A NAME="188"></A>into the service of evil, and he is mischievous in proportion to his 
<A NAME="189"></A>cleverness.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>But what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days 
<A NAME="192"></A>of their youth; and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures, 

<A NAME="193"></A>such as eating and drinking, which, like leaden weights, were attached 
<A NAME="194"></A>to them at their birth, and which drag them down and turn the vision of 
<A NAME="195"></A>their souls upon the things that are below --if, I say, they had been released 
<A NAME="196"></A>from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction, the very same 
<A NAME="197"></A>faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly as they see what their 
<A NAME="198"></A>eyes are turned to now.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>Very likely.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Yes, I said; and there is another thing which is likely. or rather 
<A NAME="201"></A>a necessary inference from what has preceded, that neither the uneducated 
<A NAME="202"></A>and uninformed of the truth, nor yet those who never make an end of their 
<A NAME="203"></A>education, will be able ministers of State; not the former, because they 
<A NAME="204"></A>have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their actions, private 
<A NAME="205"></A>as well as public; nor the latter, because they will not act at all except 
<A NAME="206"></A>upon compulsion, fancying that they are already dwelling apart in the islands 
<A NAME="207"></A>of the blest.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he replied.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Then, I said, the business of us who are the founders of the State 

<A NAME="210"></A>will be to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we have 
<A NAME="211"></A>already shown to be the greatest of all-they must continue to ascend until 
<A NAME="212"></A>they arrive at the good; but when they have ascended and seen enough we 
<A NAME="213"></A>must not allow them to do as they do now.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean?
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>I mean that they remain in the upper world: but this must not be allowed; 
<A NAME="216"></A>they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the den, and 
<A NAME="217"></A>partake of their labours and honours, whether they are worth having or 
<A NAME="218"></A>not.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>But is not this unjust? he said; ought we to give them a worse 
<A NAME="220"></A>life, when they might have a better?
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>You have again forgotten, my friend, I said, the intention of the 
<A NAME="222"></A>legislator, who did not aim at making any one class in the State happy 
<A NAME="223"></A>above the rest; the happiness was to be in the whole State, and he held 
<A NAME="224"></A>the citizens together by persuasion and necessity, making them benefactors 
<A NAME="225"></A>of the State, and therefore benefactors of one another; to this end he 
<A NAME="226"></A>created them, not to please themselves, but to be his instruments in binding 

<A NAME="227"></A>up the State.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>True, he said, I had forgotten.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Observe, Glaucon, that there will be no injustice in compelling our 
<A NAME="230"></A>philosophers to have a care and providence of others; we shall explain 
<A NAME="231"></A>to them that in other States, men of their class are not obliged to share 
<A NAME="232"></A>in the toils of politics: and this is reasonable, for they grow up at their 
<A NAME="233"></A>own sweet will, and the government would rather not have them. Being self-taught, 
<A NAME="234"></A>they cannot be expected to show any gratitude for a culture which they 
<A NAME="235"></A>have never received. But we have brought you into the world to be rulers 
<A NAME="236"></A>of the hive, kings of yourselves and of the other citizens, and have educated 
<A NAME="237"></A>you far better and more perfectly than they have been educated, and you 
<A NAME="238"></A>are better able to share in the double duty. Wherefore each of you, when 
<A NAME="239"></A>his turn comes, must go down to the general underground abode, and get 
<A NAME="240"></A>the habit of seeing in the dark. When you have acquired the habit, you 
<A NAME="241"></A>will see ten thousand times better than the inhabitants of the den, and 
<A NAME="242"></A>you will know what the several images are, and what they represent, because 
<A NAME="243"></A>you have seen the beautiful and just and good in their truth. And thus 

<A NAME="244"></A>our State which is also yours will be a reality, and not a dream only, 
<A NAME="245"></A>and will be administered in a spirit unlike that of other States, in which 
<A NAME="246"></A>men fight with one another about shadows only and are distracted in the 
<A NAME="247"></A>struggle for power, which in their eyes is a great good. Whereas the truth 
<A NAME="248"></A>is that the State in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always 
<A NAME="249"></A>the best and most quietly governed, and the State in which they are most 
<A NAME="250"></A>eager, the worst.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>Quite true, he replied.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>And will our pupils, when they hear this, refuse to take their turn 
<A NAME="253"></A>at the toils of State, when they are allowed to spend the greater part 
<A NAME="254"></A>of their time with one another in the heavenly light?
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>Impossible, he answered; for they are just men, and the commands 
<A NAME="256"></A>which we impose upon them are just; there can be no doubt that every one 
<A NAME="257"></A>of them will take office as a stern necessity, and not after the fashion 
<A NAME="258"></A>of our present rulers of State.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>Yes, my friend, I said; and there lies the point. You must contrive 
<A NAME="260"></A>for your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler, 

<A NAME="261"></A>and then you may have a well-ordered State; for only in the State which 
<A NAME="262"></A>offers this, will they rule who are truly rich, not in silver and gold, 
<A NAME="263"></A>but in virtue and wisdom, which are the true blessings of life. Whereas 
<A NAME="264"></A>if they go to the administration of public affairs, poor and hungering 
<A NAME="265"></A>after the' own private advantage, thinking that hence they are to snatch 
<A NAME="266"></A>the chief good, order there can never be; for they will be fighting about 
<A NAME="267"></A>office, and the civil and domestic broils which thus arise will be the 
<A NAME="268"></A>ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole State.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>Most true, he replied.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>And the only life which looks down upon the life of political ambition 
<A NAME="271"></A>is that of true philosophy. Do you know of any other?
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, I do not, he said.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>And those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task? For, if they 
<A NAME="274"></A>are, there will be rival lovers, and they will fight.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>No question.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>Who then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians? Surely they 
<A NAME="277"></A>will be the men who are wisest about affairs of State, and by whom the 

<A NAME="278"></A>State is best administered, and who at the same time have other honours 
<A NAME="279"></A>and another and a better life than that of politics?
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>They are the men, and I will choose them, he 
<A NAME="281"></A>replied.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>And now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced, 
<A NAME="283"></A>and how they are to be brought from darkness to light, --as some are said 
<A NAME="284"></A>to have ascended from the world below to the gods?
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>By all means, he replied.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>The process, I said, is not the turning over of an oyster-shell, but 
<A NAME="287"></A>the turning round of a soul passing from a day which is little better than 
<A NAME="288"></A>night to the true day of being, that is, the ascent from below, which we 
<A NAME="289"></A>affirm to be true philosophy?
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>Quite so.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>And should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of effecting 
<A NAME="292"></A>such a change?
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>What sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming 

<A NAME="295"></A>to being? And another consideration has just occurred to me: You will remember 
<A NAME="296"></A>that our young men are to be warrior athletes
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that was said.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional 
<A NAME="299"></A>quality?
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>What quality?
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Usefulness in war.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Yes, if possible.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>There were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there 
<A NAME="304"></A>not?
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>Just so.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>There was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the 
<A NAME="307"></A>body, and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and 
<A NAME="308"></A>corruption?
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover? 
<A NAME="311"></A>No.

<A NAME="312"></A><BR>But what do you say of music, which also entered to a certain extent 
<A NAME="313"></A>into our former scheme?
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>Music, he said, as you will remember, was the counterpart of gymnastic, 
<A NAME="315"></A>and trained the guardians by the influences of habit, by harmony making 
<A NAME="316"></A>them harmonious, by rhythm rhythmical, but not giving them science; and 
<A NAME="317"></A>the words, whether fabulous or possibly true, had kindred elements of rhythm 
<A NAME="318"></A>and harmony in them. But in music there was nothing which tended to that 
<A NAME="319"></A>good which you are now seeking.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>You are most accurate, I said, in your recollection; in music there 
<A NAME="321"></A>certainly was nothing of the kind. But what branch of knowledge is there, 
<A NAME="322"></A>my dear Glaucon, which is of the desired nature; since all the useful arts 
<A NAME="323"></A>were reckoned mean by us?
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>Undoubtedly; and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded, and the 
<A NAME="325"></A>arts are also excluded, what remains?
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>Well, I said, there may be nothing left of our special subjects; 
<A NAME="327"></A>and then we shall have to take something which is not special, but of universal 
<A NAME="328"></A>application.

<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>What may that be?
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>A something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in common, 
<A NAME="331"></A>and which every one first has to learn among the elements of 
<A NAME="332"></A>education.
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>What is that?
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>The little matter of distinguishing one, two, and three --in a word, 
<A NAME="335"></A>number and calculation: --do not all arts and sciences necessarily partake 
<A NAME="336"></A>of them?
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Then the art of war partakes of them?
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>To the sure.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Then Palamedes, whenever he appears in tragedy, proves Agamemnon ridiculously 
<A NAME="341"></A>unfit to be a general. Did you never remark how he declares that he had 
<A NAME="342"></A>invented number, and had numbered the ships and set in array the ranks 
<A NAME="343"></A>of the army at Troy; which implies that they had never been numbered before, 
<A NAME="344"></A>and Agamemnon must be supposed literally to have been incapable of counting 
<A NAME="345"></A>his own feet --how could he if he was ignorant of number? And if that is 

<A NAME="346"></A>true, what sort of general must he have been?
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>I should say a very strange one, if this was as you 
<A NAME="348"></A>say.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Can we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of 
<A NAME="350"></A>arithmetic?
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>Certainly he should, if he is to have the smallest understanding of 
<A NAME="352"></A>military tactics, or indeed, I should rather say, if he is to be a man 
<A NAME="353"></A>at all.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>I should like to know whether you have the same notion which I 
<A NAME="355"></A>have of this study?
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>What is your notion?
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>It appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking, and 
<A NAME="358"></A>which leads naturally to reflection, but never to have been rightly used; 
<A NAME="359"></A>for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards 
<A NAME="360"></A>being.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>Will you explain your meaning? he said.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>I will try, I said; and I wish you would share the enquiry with me, 

<A NAME="363"></A>and say 'yes' or 'no' when I attempt to distinguish in my own mind what 
<A NAME="364"></A>branches of knowledge have this attracting power, in order that we may 
<A NAME="365"></A>have clearer proof that arithmetic is, as I suspect, one of 
<A NAME="366"></A>them.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR>Explain, he said.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>I mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds; some of them 
<A NAME="369"></A>do not invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them; while 
<A NAME="370"></A>in the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that further enquiry 
<A NAME="371"></A>is imperatively demanded.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>You are clearly referring, he said, to the manner in which the 
<A NAME="373"></A>senses are imposed upon by distance, and by painting in light and 
<A NAME="374"></A>shade.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>No, I said, that is not at all my meaning.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Then what is your meaning?
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>When speaking of uninviting objects, I mean those which do not pass 
<A NAME="378"></A>from one sensation to the opposite; inviting objects are those which do; 
<A NAME="379"></A>in this latter case the sense coming upon the object, whether at a distance 

<A NAME="380"></A>or near, gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular than of its 
<A NAME="381"></A>opposite. An illustration will make my meaning clearer: --here are three 
<A NAME="382"></A>fingers --a little finger, a second finger, and a middle 
<A NAME="383"></A>finger.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>Very good.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>You may suppose that they are seen quite close: And here comes the 
<A NAME="386"></A>point.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>What is it?
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Each of them equally appears a finger, whether seen in the middle or 
<A NAME="389"></A>at the extremity, whether white or black, or thick or thin --it makes no 
<A NAME="390"></A>difference; a finger is a finger all the same. In these cases a man is 
<A NAME="391"></A>not compelled to ask of thought the question, what is a finger? for the 
<A NAME="392"></A>sight never intimates to the mind that a finger is other than a 
<A NAME="393"></A>finger.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>And therefore, I said, as we might expect, there is nothing here which 
<A NAME="396"></A>invites or excites intelligence.

<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>There is not, he said.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>But is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers? 
<A NAME="399"></A>Can sight adequately perceive them? and is no difference made by the circumstance 
<A NAME="400"></A>that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at the extremity? 
<A NAME="401"></A>And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the qualities of 
<A NAME="402"></A>thickness or thinness, or softness or hardness? And so of the other senses; 
<A NAME="403"></A>do they give perfect intimations of such matters? Is not their mode of 
<A NAME="404"></A>operation on this wise --the sense which is concerned with the quality 
<A NAME="405"></A>of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the quality of softness, 
<A NAME="406"></A>and only intimates to the soul that the same thing is felt to be both hard 
<A NAME="407"></A>and soft?
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>You are quite right, he said.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>And must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the sense 
<A NAME="410"></A>gives of a hard which is also soft? What, again, is the meaning of light 
<A NAME="411"></A>and heavy, if that which is light is also heavy, and that which is heavy, 
<A NAME="412"></A>light?
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, these intimations which the soul receives are very 

<A NAME="414"></A>curious and require to be explained.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said, and in these perplexities the soul naturally summons 
<A NAME="416"></A>to her aid calculation and intelligence, that she may see whether the several 
<A NAME="417"></A>objects announced to her are one or two.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>And if they turn out to be two, is not each of them one and 
<A NAME="420"></A>different?
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>And if each is one, and both are two, she will conceive the two as 
<A NAME="423"></A>in a state of division, for if there were undivided they could only be 
<A NAME="424"></A>conceived of as one?
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>The eye certainly did see both small and great, but only in a confused 
<A NAME="427"></A>manner; they were not distinguished.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Whereas the thinking mind, intending to light up the chaos, was compelled 
<A NAME="430"></A>to reverse the process, and look at small and great as separate and not 

<A NAME="431"></A>confused.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Was not this the beginning of the enquiry 'What is great?' and 'What 
<A NAME="434"></A>is small?'
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>Exactly so.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>And thus arose the distinction of the visible and the 
<A NAME="437"></A>intelligible.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Most true.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>This was what I meant when I spoke of impressions which invited the 
<A NAME="440"></A>intellect, or the reverse --those which are simultaneous with opposite 
<A NAME="441"></A>impressions, invite thought; those which are not simultaneous do 
<A NAME="442"></A>not.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>I understand, he said, and agree with you.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>And to which class do unity and number belong?
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>I do not know, he replied.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Think a little and you will see that what has preceded will supply 
<A NAME="447"></A>the answer; for if simple unity could be adequately perceived by the sight 

<A NAME="448"></A>or by any other sense, then, as we were saying in the case of the finger, 
<A NAME="449"></A>there would be nothing to attract towards being; but when there is some 
<A NAME="450"></A>contradiction always present, and one is the reverse of one and involves 
<A NAME="451"></A>the conception of plurality, then thought begins to be aroused within us, 
<A NAME="452"></A>and the soul perplexed and wanting to arrive at a decision asks 'What is 
<A NAME="453"></A>absolute unity?' This is the way in which the study of the one has a power 
<A NAME="454"></A>of drawing and converting the mind to the contemplation of true 
<A NAME="455"></A>being.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>And surely, he said, this occurs notably in the case of one; for 
<A NAME="457"></A>we see the same thing to be both one and infinite in 
<A NAME="458"></A>multitude?
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said; and this being true of one must be equally true of 
<A NAME="460"></A>all number?
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>And all arithmetic and calculation have to do with 
<A NAME="463"></A>number?
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Yes.

<A NAME="465"></A><BR>And they appear to lead the mind towards truth?
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>Yes, in a very remarkable manner.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Then this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking, having 
<A NAME="468"></A>a double use, military and philosophical; for the man of war must learn 
<A NAME="469"></A>the art of number or he will not know how to array his troops, and the 
<A NAME="470"></A>philosopher also, because he has to rise out of the sea of change and lay 
<A NAME="471"></A>hold of true being, and therefore he must be an arithmetician.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>And our guardian is both warrior and philosopher?
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Then this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe; 
<A NAME="476"></A>and we must endeavour to persuade those who are prescribe to be the principal 
<A NAME="477"></A>men of our State to go and learn arithmetic, not as amateurs, but they 
<A NAME="478"></A>must carry on the study until they see the nature of numbers with the mind 
<A NAME="479"></A>only; nor again, like merchants or retail-traders, with a view to buying 
<A NAME="480"></A>or selling, but for the sake of their military use, and of the soul herself; 
<A NAME="481"></A>and because this will be the easiest way for her to pass from becoming 

<A NAME="482"></A>to truth and being.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>That is excellent, he said.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Yes, I said, and now having spoken of it, I must add how charming the 
<A NAME="485"></A>science is! and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end, if pursued 
<A NAME="486"></A>in the spirit of a philosopher, and not of a shopkeeper!
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>How do you mean?
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>I mean, as I was saying, that arithmetic has a very great and elevating 
<A NAME="489"></A>effect, compelling the soul to reason about abstract number, and rebelling 
<A NAME="490"></A>against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into the argument. 
<A NAME="491"></A>You know how steadily the masters of the art repel and ridicule any one 
<A NAME="492"></A>who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is calculating, and if you 
<A NAME="493"></A>divide, they multiply, taking care that one shall continue one and not 
<A NAME="494"></A>become lost in fractions.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>That is very true.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Now, suppose a person were to say to them: O my friends, what are these 
<A NAME="497"></A>wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning, in which, as you say, 
<A NAME="498"></A>there is a unity such as you demand, and each unit is equal, invariable, 

<A NAME="499"></A>indivisible, --what would they answer?
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>They would answer, as I should conceive, that they were speaking 
<A NAME="501"></A>of those numbers which can only be realised in thought.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>Then you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary, 
<A NAME="503"></A>necessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the 
<A NAME="504"></A>attainment of pure truth?
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>Yes; that is a marked characteristic of it.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>And have you further observed, that those who have a natural talent 
<A NAME="507"></A>for calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge; and 
<A NAME="508"></A>even the dull if they have had an arithmetical training, although they 
<A NAME="509"></A>may derive no other advantage from it, always become much quicker than 
<A NAME="510"></A>they would otherwise have been.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>And indeed, you will not easily find a more difficult study, and not 
<A NAME="513"></A>many as difficult.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR>You will not.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>And, for all these reasons, arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which 

<A NAME="516"></A>the best natures should be trained, and which must not be given 
<A NAME="517"></A>up.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>I agree.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Let this then be made one of our subjects of education. And next, shall 
<A NAME="520"></A>we enquire whether the kindred science also concerns 
<A NAME="521"></A>us?
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>You mean geometry?
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Exactly so.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Clearly, he said, we are concerned with that part of geometry which 
<A NAME="525"></A>relates to war; for in pitching a camp, or taking up a position, or closing 
<A NAME="526"></A>or extending the lines of an army, or any other military manoeuvre, whether 
<A NAME="527"></A>in actual battle or on a march, it will make all the difference whether 
<A NAME="528"></A>a general is or is not a geometrician.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said, but for that purpose a very little of either geometry 
<A NAME="530"></A>or calculation will be enough; the question relates rather to the greater 
<A NAME="531"></A>and more advanced part of geometry --whether that tends in any degree to 
<A NAME="532"></A>make more easy the vision of the idea of good; and thither, as I was saying, 

<A NAME="533"></A>all things tend which compel the soul to turn her gaze towards that place, 
<A NAME="534"></A>where is the full perfection of being, which she ought, by all means, to 
<A NAME="535"></A>behold.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>Then if geometry compels us to view being, it concerns us; if becoming 
<A NAME="538"></A>only, it does not concern us?
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that is what we assert.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Yet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not deny 
<A NAME="541"></A>that such a conception of the science is in flat contradiction to the ordinary 
<A NAME="542"></A>language of geometricians.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR>How so?
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>They have in view practice only, and are always speaking? in a narrow 
<A NAME="545"></A>and ridiculous manner, of squaring and extending and applying and the like 
<A NAME="546"></A>--they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of daily life; whereas 
<A NAME="547"></A>knowledge is the real object of the whole science.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Then must not a further admission be made?

<A NAME="550"></A><BR>What admission?
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>That the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal, 
<A NAME="552"></A>and not of aught perishing and transient.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>That, he replied, may be readily allowed, and is 
<A NAME="554"></A>true.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Then, my noble friend, geometry will draw the soul towards truth, and 
<A NAME="556"></A>create the spirit of philosophy, and raise up that which is now unhappily 
<A NAME="557"></A>allowed to fall down.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>Nothing will be more likely to have such an 
<A NAME="559"></A>effect.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>Then nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants 
<A NAME="561"></A>of your fair city should by all means learn geometry. Moreover the science 
<A NAME="562"></A>has indirect effects, which are not small.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>Of what kind? he said.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>There are the military advantages of which you spoke, I said; and in 
<A NAME="565"></A>all departments of knowledge, as experience proves, any one who has studied 
<A NAME="566"></A>geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one who has 

<A NAME="567"></A>not.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>Yes indeed, he said, there is an infinite difference between 
<A NAME="569"></A>them.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Then shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our 
<A NAME="571"></A>youth will study?
<A NAME="572"></A><BR><BR>Let us do so, he replied.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>And suppose we make astronomy the third --what do you 
<A NAME="574"></A>say?
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>I am strongly inclined to it, he said; the observation of the seasons 
<A NAME="576"></A>and of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the 
<A NAME="577"></A>farmer or sailor.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>I am amused, I said, at your fear of the world, which makes you 
<A NAME="579"></A>guard against the appearance of insisting upon useless studies; and I quite 
<A NAME="580"></A>admit the difficulty of believing that in every man there is an eye of 
<A NAME="581"></A>the soul which, when by other pursuits lost and dimmed, is by these purified 
<A NAME="582"></A>and re-illumined; and is more precious far than ten thousand bodily eyes, 
<A NAME="583"></A>for by it alone is truth seen. Now there are two classes of persons: one 

<A NAME="584"></A>class of those who will agree with you and will take your words as a revelation; 
<A NAME="585"></A>another class to whom they will be utterly unmeaning, and who will naturally 
<A NAME="586"></A>deem them to be idle tales, for they see no sort of profit which is to 
<A NAME="587"></A>be obtained from them. And therefore you had better decide at once with 
<A NAME="588"></A>which of the two you are proposing to argue. You will very likely say with 
<A NAME="589"></A>neither, and that your chief aim in carrying on the argument is your own 
<A NAME="590"></A>improvement; at the same time you do not grudge to others any benefit which 
<A NAME="591"></A>they may receive.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>I think that I should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on 
<A NAME="593"></A>my own behalf.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR>Then take a step backward, for we have gone wrong in the order 
<A NAME="595"></A>of the sciences.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>What was the mistake? he said.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>After plane geometry, I said, we proceeded at once to solids in revolution, 
<A NAME="598"></A>instead of taking solids in themselves; whereas after the second dimension 
<A NAME="599"></A>the third, which is concerned with cubes and dimensions of depth, ought 
<A NAME="600"></A>to have followed.

<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>That is true, Socrates; but so little seems to be known as yet 
<A NAME="602"></A>about these subjects.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>Why, yes, I said, and for two reasons: --in the first place, no 
<A NAME="604"></A>government patronises them; this leads to a want of energy in the pursuit 
<A NAME="605"></A>of them, and they are difficult; in the second place, students cannot learn 
<A NAME="606"></A>them unless they have a director. But then a director can hardly be found, 
<A NAME="607"></A>and even if he could, as matters now stand, the students, who are very 
<A NAME="608"></A>conceited, would not attend to him. That, however, would be otherwise if 
<A NAME="609"></A>the whole State became the director of these studies and gave honour to 
<A NAME="610"></A>them; then disciples would want to come, and there would be continuous 
<A NAME="611"></A>and earnest search, and discoveries would be made; since even now, disregarded 
<A NAME="612"></A>as they are by the world, and maimed of their fair proportions, and although 
<A NAME="613"></A>none of their votaries can tell the use of them, still these studies force 
<A NAME="614"></A>their way by their natural charm, and very likely, if they had the help 
<A NAME="615"></A>of the State, they would some day emerge into light.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, there is a remarkable charm in them. But I do not 
<A NAME="617"></A>clearly understand the change in the order. First you began with a geometry 

<A NAME="618"></A>of plane surfaces?
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>And you placed astronomy next, and then you made a step 
<A NAME="621"></A>backward?
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Yes, and I have delayed you by my hurry; the ludicrous state of solid 
<A NAME="623"></A>geometry, which, in natural order, should have followed, made me pass over 
<A NAME="624"></A>this branch and go on to astronomy, or motion of solids.
<A NAME="625"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>Then assuming that the science now omitted would come into existence 
<A NAME="627"></A>if encouraged by the State, let us go on to astronomy, which will be 
<A NAME="628"></A>fourth.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>The right order, he replied. And now, Socrates, as you rebuked 
<A NAME="630"></A>the vulgar manner in which I praised astronomy before, my praise shall 
<A NAME="631"></A>be given in your own spirit. For every one, as I think, must see that astronomy 
<A NAME="632"></A>compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world to 
<A NAME="633"></A>another.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR>Every one but myself, I said; to every one else this may be clear, 

<A NAME="635"></A>but not to me.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>And what then would you say?
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>I should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy 
<A NAME="638"></A>appear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean? he asked.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>You, I replied, have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our 
<A NAME="641"></A>knowledge of the things above. And I dare say that if a person were to 
<A NAME="642"></A>throw his head back and study the fretted ceiling, you would still think 
<A NAME="643"></A>that his mind was the percipient, and not his eyes. And you are very likely 
<A NAME="644"></A>right, and I may be a simpleton: but, in my opinion, that knowledge only 
<A NAME="645"></A>which is of being and of the unseen can make the soul look upwards, and 
<A NAME="646"></A>whether a man gapes at the heavens or blinks on the ground, seeking to 
<A NAME="647"></A>learn some particular of sense, I would deny that he can learn, for nothing 
<A NAME="648"></A>of that sort is matter of science; his soul is looking downwards, not upwards, 
<A NAME="649"></A>whether his way to knowledge is by water or by land, whether he floats, 
<A NAME="650"></A>or only lies on his back.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR>I acknowledge, he said, the justice of your rebuke. Still, I should 

<A NAME="652"></A>like to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more conducive 
<A NAME="653"></A>to that knowledge of which we are speaking?
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>I will tell you, I said: The starry heaven which we behold is wrought 
<A NAME="655"></A>upon a visible ground, and therefore, although the fairest and most perfect 
<A NAME="656"></A>of visible things, must necessarily be deemed inferior far to the true 
<A NAME="657"></A>motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness, which are relative 
<A NAME="658"></A>to each other, and carry with them that which is contained in them, in 
<A NAME="659"></A>the true number and in every true figure. Now, these are to be apprehended 
<A NAME="660"></A>by reason and intelligence, but not by sight.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR>True, he replied.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>The spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to 
<A NAME="663"></A>that higher knowledge; their beauty is like the beauty of figures or pictures 
<A NAME="664"></A>excellently wrought by the hand of Daedalus, or some other great artist, 
<A NAME="665"></A>which we may chance to behold; any geometrician who saw them would appreciate 
<A NAME="666"></A>the exquisiteness of their workmanship, but he would never dream of thinking 
<A NAME="667"></A>that in them he could find the true equal or the true double, or the truth 
<A NAME="668"></A>of any other proportion.

<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>No, he replied, such an idea would be ridiculous.
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks 
<A NAME="671"></A>at the movements of the stars? Will he not think that heaven and the things 
<A NAME="672"></A>in heaven are framed by the Creator of them in the most perfect manner? 
<A NAME="673"></A>But he will never imagine that the proportions of night and day, or of 
<A NAME="674"></A>both to the month, or of the month to the year, or of the stars to these 
<A NAME="675"></A>and to one another, and any other things that are material and visible 
<A NAME="676"></A>can also be eternal and subject to no deviation --that would be absurd; 
<A NAME="677"></A>and it is equally absurd to take so much pains in investigating their exact 
<A NAME="678"></A>truth.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>I quite agree, though I never thought of this 
<A NAME="680"></A>before.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Then, I said, in astronomy, as in geometry, we should employ problems, 
<A NAME="682"></A>and let the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the right 
<A NAME="683"></A>way and so make the natural gift of reason to be of any real 
<A NAME="684"></A>use.
<A NAME="685"></A><BR><BR>That, he said, is a work infinitely beyond our present 

<A NAME="686"></A>astronomers.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>Yes, I said; and there are many other things which must also have a 
<A NAME="688"></A>similar extension given to them, if our legislation is to be of any value. 
<A NAME="689"></A>But can you tell me of any other suitable study?
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>No, he said, not without thinking.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Motion, I said, has many forms, and not one only; two of them are obvious 
<A NAME="692"></A>enough even to wits no better than ours; and there are others, as I imagine, 
<A NAME="693"></A>which may be left to wiser persons.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>But where are the two?
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>There is a second, I said, which is the counterpart of the one already 
<A NAME="696"></A>named.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR>And what may that be?
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>The second, I said, would seem relatively to the ears to be what the 
<A NAME="699"></A>first is to the eyes; for I conceive that as the eyes are designed to look 
<A NAME="700"></A>up at the stars, so are the ears to hear harmonious motions; and these 
<A NAME="701"></A>are sister sciences --as the Pythagoreans say, and we, Glaucon, agree with 
<A NAME="702"></A>them?

<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he replied.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>But this, I said, is a laborious study, and therefore we had better 
<A NAME="705"></A>go and learn of them; and they will tell us whether there are any other 
<A NAME="706"></A>applications of these sciences. At the same time, we must not lose sight 
<A NAME="707"></A>of our own higher object.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>What is that?
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>There is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach, and which 
<A NAME="710"></A>our pupils ought also to attain, and not to fall short of, as I was saying 
<A NAME="711"></A>that they did in astronomy. For in the science of harmony, as you probably 
<A NAME="712"></A>know, the same thing happens. The teachers of harmony compare the sounds 
<A NAME="713"></A>and consonances which are heard only, and their labour, like that of the 
<A NAME="714"></A>astronomers, is in vain.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>Yes, by heaven! he said; and 'tis as good as a play to hear them 
<A NAME="716"></A>talking about their condensed notes, as they call them; they put their 
<A NAME="717"></A>ears close alongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from 
<A NAME="718"></A>their neighbour's wall --one set of them declaring that they distinguish 
<A NAME="719"></A>an intermediate note and have found the least interval which should be 

<A NAME="720"></A>the unit of measurement; the others insisting that the two sounds have 
<A NAME="721"></A>passed into the same --either party setting their ears before their 
<A NAME="722"></A>understanding.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>You mean, I said, those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings 
<A NAME="724"></A>and rack them on the pegs of the instrument: might carry on the metaphor 
<A NAME="725"></A>and speak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives, and 
<A NAME="726"></A>make accusations against the strings, both of backwardness and forwardness 
<A NAME="727"></A>to sound; but this would be tedious, and therefore I will only say that 
<A NAME="728"></A>these are not the men, and that I am referring to the Pythagoreans, of 
<A NAME="729"></A>whom I was just now proposing to enquire about harmony. For they too are 
<A NAME="730"></A>in error, like the astronomers; they investigate the numbers of the harmonies 
<A NAME="731"></A>which are heard, but they never attain to problems-that is to say, they 
<A NAME="732"></A>never reach the natural harmonies of number, or reflect why some numbers 
<A NAME="733"></A>are harmonious and others not.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR>That, he said, is a thing of more than mortal 
<A NAME="735"></A>knowledge.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>A thing, I replied, which I would rather call useful; that is, if sought 

<A NAME="737"></A>after with a view to the beautiful and good; but if pursued in any other 
<A NAME="738"></A>spirit, useless. Very true, he said.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>Now, when all these studies reach the point of inter-communion 
<A NAME="740"></A>and connection with one another, and come to be considered in their mutual 
<A NAME="741"></A>affinities, then, I think, but not till then, will the pursuit of them 
<A NAME="742"></A>have a value for our objects; otherwise there is no profit in 
<A NAME="743"></A>them.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR>I suspect so; but you are speaking, Socrates, of a vast 
<A NAME="745"></A>work.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>What do you mean? I said; the prelude or what? Do you not know that 
<A NAME="747"></A>all this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn? 
<A NAME="748"></A>For you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a 
<A NAME="749"></A>dialectician?
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR>Assuredly not, he said; I have hardly ever known a mathematician 
<A NAME="751"></A>who was capable of reasoning.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR>But do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason 
<A NAME="753"></A>will have the knowledge which we require of them?

<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>Neither can this be supposed.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>And so, Glaucon, I said, we have at last arrived at the hymn of dialectic. 
<A NAME="756"></A>This is that strain which is of the intellect only, but which the faculty 
<A NAME="757"></A>of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate; for sight, as you may remember, 
<A NAME="758"></A>was imagined by us after a while to behold the real animals and stars, 
<A NAME="759"></A>and last of all the sun himself. And so with dialectic; when a person starts 
<A NAME="760"></A>on the discovery of the absolute by the light of reason only, and without 
<A NAME="761"></A>any assistance of sense, and perseveres until by pure intelligence he arrives 
<A NAME="762"></A>at the perception of the absolute good, he at last finds himself at the 
<A NAME="763"></A>end of the intellectual world, as in the case of sight at the end of the 
<A NAME="764"></A>visible.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR>Exactly, he said.
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>Then this is the progress which you call dialectic?
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>But the release of the prisoners from chains, and their translation 
<A NAME="769"></A>from the shadows to the images and to the light, and the ascent from the 
<A NAME="770"></A>underground den to the sun, while in his presence they are vainly trying 

<A NAME="771"></A>to look on animals and plants and the light of the sun, but are able to 
<A NAME="772"></A>perceive even with their weak eyes the images in the water (which are divine), 
<A NAME="773"></A>and are the shadows of true existence (not shadows of images cast by a 
<A NAME="774"></A>light of fire, which compared with the sun is only an image) --this power 
<A NAME="775"></A>of elevating the highest principle in the soul to the contemplation of 
<A NAME="776"></A>that which is best in existence, with which we may compare the raising 
<A NAME="777"></A>of that faculty which is the very light of the body to the sight of that 
<A NAME="778"></A>which is brightest in the material and visible world --this power is given, 
<A NAME="779"></A>as I was saying, by all that study and pursuit of the arts which has been 
<A NAME="780"></A>described.
<A NAME="781"></A><BR><BR>I agree in what you are saying, he replied, which may be hard to 
<A NAME="782"></A>believe, yet, from another point of view, is harder still to deny. This, 
<A NAME="783"></A>however, is not a theme to be treated of in passing only, but will have 
<A NAME="784"></A>to be discussed again and again. And so, whether our conclusion be true 
<A NAME="785"></A>or false, let us assume all this, and proceed at once from the prelude 
<A NAME="786"></A>or preamble to the chief strain, and describe that in like manner. Say, 
<A NAME="787"></A>then, what is the nature and what are the divisions of dialectic, and what 

<A NAME="788"></A>are the paths which lead thither; for these paths will also lead to our 
<A NAME="789"></A>final rest?
<A NAME="790"></A><BR><BR>Dear Glaucon, I said, you will not be able to follow me here, though 
<A NAME="791"></A>I would do my best, and you should behold not an image only but the absolute 
<A NAME="792"></A>truth, according to my notion. Whether what I told you would or would not 
<A NAME="793"></A>have been a reality I cannot venture to say; but you would have seen something 
<A NAME="794"></A>like reality; of that I am confident.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR>Doubtless, he replied.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>But I must also remind you, that the power of dialectic alone can reveal 
<A NAME="797"></A>this, and only to one who is a disciple of the previous 
<A NAME="798"></A>sciences.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR><BR>Of that assertion you may be as confident as of the 
<A NAME="800"></A>last.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>And assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method of comprehending 
<A NAME="802"></A>by any regular process all true existence or of ascertaining what each 
<A NAME="803"></A>thing is in its own nature; for the arts in general are concerned with 
<A NAME="804"></A>the desires or opinions of men, or are cultivated with a view to production 

<A NAME="805"></A>and construction, or for the preservation of such productions and constructions; 
<A NAME="806"></A>and as to the mathematical sciences which, as we were saying, have some 
<A NAME="807"></A>apprehension of true being --geometry and the like --they only dream about 
<A NAME="808"></A>being, but never can they behold the waking reality so long as they leave 
<A NAME="809"></A>the hypotheses which they use unexamined, and are unable to give an account 
<A NAME="810"></A>of them. For when a man knows not his own first principle, and when the 
<A NAME="811"></A>conclusion and intermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows 
<A NAME="812"></A>not what, how can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever 
<A NAME="813"></A>become science?
<A NAME="814"></A><BR><BR>Impossible, he said.
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>Then dialectic, and dialectic alone, goes directly to the first principle 
<A NAME="816"></A>and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in order to make 
<A NAME="817"></A>her ground secure; the eye of the soul, which is literally buried in an 
<A NAME="818"></A>outlandish slough, is by her gentle aid lifted upwards; and she uses as 
<A NAME="819"></A>handmaids and helpers in the work of conversion, the sciences which we 
<A NAME="820"></A>have been discussing. Custom terms them sciences, but they ought to have 
<A NAME="821"></A>some other name, implying greater clearness than opinion and less clearness 

<A NAME="822"></A>than science: and this, in our previous sketch, was called understanding. 
<A NAME="823"></A>But why should we dispute about names when we have realities of such importance 
<A NAME="824"></A>to consider?
<A NAME="825"></A><BR><BR>Why indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the 
<A NAME="826"></A>thought of the mind with clearness?
<A NAME="827"></A><BR><BR>At any rate, we are satisfied, as before, to have four divisions; 
<A NAME="828"></A>two for intellect and two for opinion, and to call the first division science, 
<A NAME="829"></A>the second understanding, the third belief, and the fourth perception of 
<A NAME="830"></A>shadows, opinion being concerned with becoming, and intellect with being; 
<A NAME="831"></A>and so to make a proportion: --
<A NAME="832"></A><BR><BR>As being is to becoming, so is pure intellect to 
<A NAME="833"></A>opinion.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>And as intellect is to opinion, so is science to belief, and understanding 
<A NAME="835"></A>to the perception of shadows. But let us defer the further correlation 
<A NAME="836"></A>and subdivision of the subjects of opinion and of intellect, for it will 
<A NAME="837"></A>be a long enquiry, many times longer than this has been.
<A NAME="838"></A><BR><BR>As far as I understand, he said, I agree.

<A NAME="839"></A><BR>And do you also agree, I said, in describing the dialectician as one 
<A NAME="840"></A>who attains a conception of the essence of each thing? And he who does 
<A NAME="841"></A>not possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in whatever 
<A NAME="842"></A>degree he fails, may in that degree also be said to fail in intelligence? 
<A NAME="843"></A>Will you admit so much?
<A NAME="844"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; how can I deny it?
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>And you would say the same of the conception of the 
<A NAME="846"></A>good?
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>Until the person is able to abstract and define rationally the idea 
<A NAME="848"></A>of good, and unless he can run the gauntlet of all objections, and is ready 
<A NAME="849"></A>to disprove them, not by appeals to opinion, but to absolute truth, never 
<A NAME="850"></A>faltering at any step of the argument --unless he can do all this, you 
<A NAME="851"></A>would say that he knows neither the idea of good nor any other good; he 
<A NAME="852"></A>apprehends only a shadow, if anything at all, which is given by opinion 
<A NAME="853"></A>and not by science; --dreaming and slumbering in this life, before he is 
<A NAME="854"></A>well awake here, he arrives at the world below, and has his final 
<A NAME="855"></A>quietus.

<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR>In all that I should most certainly agree with 
<A NAME="857"></A>you.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>And surely you would not have the children of your ideal State, whom 
<A NAME="859"></A>you are nurturing and educating --if the ideal ever becomes a reality --you 
<A NAME="860"></A>would not allow the future rulers to be like posts, having no reason in 
<A NAME="861"></A>them, and yet to be set in authority over the highest 
<A NAME="862"></A>matters?
<A NAME="863"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>Then you will make a law that they shall have such an education as 
<A NAME="865"></A>will enable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering 
<A NAME="866"></A>questions?
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, you and I together will make it.
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>Dialectic, then, as you will agree, is the coping-stone of the sciences, 
<A NAME="869"></A>and is set over them; no other science can be placed higher --the nature 
<A NAME="870"></A>of knowledge can no further go?
<A NAME="871"></A><BR><BR>I agree, he said.
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>But to whom we are to assign these studies, and in what way they are 

<A NAME="873"></A>to be assigned, are questions which remain to be considered?
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR>Yes, clearly.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>You remember, I said, how the rulers were chosen 
<A NAME="876"></A>before?
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>Certainly, he said.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>The same natures must still be chosen, and the preference again given 
<A NAME="879"></A>to the surest and the bravest, and, if possible, to the fairest; and, having 
<A NAME="880"></A>noble and generous tempers, they should also have the natural gifts which 
<A NAME="881"></A>will facilitate their education.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR><BR>And what are these?
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>Such gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition; for the mind 
<A NAME="884"></A>more often faints from the severity of study than from the severity of 
<A NAME="885"></A>gymnastics: the toil is more entirely the mind's own, and is not shared 
<A NAME="886"></A>with the body.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he replied.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>Further, he of whom we are in search should have a good memory, and 
<A NAME="889"></A>be an unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line; or he will 

<A NAME="890"></A>never be able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise and to go through 
<A NAME="891"></A>all the intellectual discipline and study which we require of 
<A NAME="892"></A>him.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said; he must have natural gifts.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>The mistake at present is, that those who study philosophy have no 
<A NAME="895"></A>vocation, and this, as I was before saying, is the reason why she has fallen 
<A NAME="896"></A>into disrepute: her true sons should take her by the hand and not 
<A NAME="897"></A>bastards.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean?
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>In the first place, her votary should not have a lame or halting industry 
<A NAME="900"></A>--I mean, that he should not be half industrious and half idle: as, for 
<A NAME="901"></A>example, when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting, and all other 
<A NAME="902"></A>bodily exercises, but a hater rather than a lover of the labour of learning 
<A NAME="903"></A>or listening or enquiring. Or the occupation to which he devotes himself 
<A NAME="904"></A>may be of an opposite kind, and he may have the other sort of 
<A NAME="905"></A>lameness.
<A NAME="906"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said.

<A NAME="907"></A><BR>And as to truth, I said, is not a soul equally to be deemed halt and 
<A NAME="908"></A>lame which hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at herself 
<A NAME="909"></A>and others when they tell lies, but is patient of involuntary falsehood, 
<A NAME="910"></A>and does not mind wallowing like a swinish beast in the mire of ignorance, 
<A NAME="911"></A>and has no shame at being detected?
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR>To be sure.
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>And, again, in respect of temperance, courage, magnificence, and every 
<A NAME="914"></A>other virtue, should we not carefully distinguish between the true son 
<A NAME="915"></A>and the bastard? for where there is no discernment of such qualities States 
<A NAME="916"></A>and individuals unconsciously err and the State makes a ruler, and the 
<A NAME="917"></A>individual a friend, of one who, being defective in some part of virtue, 
<A NAME="918"></A>is in a figure lame or a bastard.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR><BR>That is very true, he said.
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>All these things, then, will have to be carefully considered by us; 
<A NAME="921"></A>and if only those whom we introduce to this vast system of education and 
<A NAME="922"></A>training are sound in body and mind, justice herself will have nothing 
<A NAME="923"></A>to say against us, and we shall be the saviours of the constitution and 

<A NAME="924"></A>of the State; but, if our pupils are men of another stamp, the reverse 
<A NAME="925"></A>will happen, and we shall pour a still greater flood of ridicule on philosophy 
<A NAME="926"></A>than she has to endure at present.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR>That would not be creditable.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>Certainly not, I said; and yet perhaps, in thus turning jest into earnest 
<A NAME="929"></A>I am equally ridiculous.
<A NAME="930"></A><BR><BR>In what respect?
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>I had forgotten, I said, that we were not serious, and spoke with too 
<A NAME="932"></A>much excitement. For when I saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled under 
<A NAME="933"></A>foot of men I could not help feeling a sort of indignation at the authors 
<A NAME="934"></A>of her disgrace: and my anger made me too vehement.
<A NAME="935"></A><BR><BR>Indeed! I was listening, and did not think so.
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>But I, who am the speaker, felt that I was. And now let me remind you 
<A NAME="937"></A>that, although in our former selection we chose old men, we must not do 
<A NAME="938"></A>so in this. Solon was under a delusion when he said that a man when he 
<A NAME="939"></A>grows old may learn many things --for he can no more learn much than he 
<A NAME="940"></A>can run much; youth is the time for any extraordinary 

<A NAME="941"></A>toil.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>And, therefore, calculation and geometry and all the other elements 
<A NAME="944"></A>of instruction, which are a preparation for dialectic, should be presented 
<A NAME="945"></A>to the mind in childhood; not, however, under any notion of forcing our 
<A NAME="946"></A>system of education.
<A NAME="947"></A><BR><BR>Why not?
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>Because a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of knowledge 
<A NAME="949"></A>of any kind. Bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm to the body; 
<A NAME="950"></A>but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the 
<A NAME="951"></A>mind.
<A NAME="952"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>Then, my good friend, I said, do not use compulsion, but let early 
<A NAME="954"></A>education be a sort of amusement; you will then be better able to find 
<A NAME="955"></A>out the natural bent.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR>That is a very rational notion, he said.
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>Do you remember that the children, too, were to be taken to see the 

<A NAME="958"></A>battle on horseback; and that if there were no danger they were to be brought 
<A NAME="959"></A>close up and, like young hounds, have a taste of blood given 
<A NAME="960"></A>them?
<A NAME="961"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I remember.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>The same practice may be followed, I said, in all these things --labours, 
<A NAME="963"></A>lessons, dangers --and he who is most at home in all of them ought to be 
<A NAME="964"></A>enrolled in a select number.
<A NAME="965"></A><BR><BR>At what age?
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>At the age when the necessary gymnastics are over: the period whether 
<A NAME="967"></A>of two or three years which passes in this sort of training is useless 
<A NAME="968"></A>for any other purpose; for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to learning; 
<A NAME="969"></A>and the trial of who is first in gymnastic exercises is one of the most 
<A NAME="970"></A>important tests to which our youth are subjected.
<A NAME="971"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he replied.
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>After that time those who are selected from the class of twenty years 
<A NAME="973"></A>old will be promoted to higher honour, and the sciences which they learned 
<A NAME="974"></A>without any order in their early education will now be brought together, 

<A NAME="975"></A>and they will be able to see the natural relationship of them to one another 
<A NAME="976"></A>and to true being.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that is the only kind of knowledge which takes lasting 
<A NAME="978"></A>root.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said; and the capacity for such knowledge is the great criterion 
<A NAME="980"></A>of dialectical talent: the comprehensive mind is always the 
<A NAME="981"></A>dialectical.
<A NAME="982"></A><BR><BR>I agree with you, he said.
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>These, I said, are the points which you must consider; and those who 
<A NAME="984"></A>have most of this comprehension, and who are more steadfast in their learning, 
<A NAME="985"></A>and in their military and other appointed duties, when they have arrived 
<A NAME="986"></A>at the age of thirty have to be chosen by you out of the select class, 
<A NAME="987"></A>and elevated to higher honour; and you will have to prove them by the help 
<A NAME="988"></A>of dialectic, in order to learn which of them is able to give up the use 
<A NAME="989"></A>of sight and the other senses, and in company with truth to attain absolute 
<A NAME="990"></A>being: And here, my friend, great caution is required.
<A NAME="991"></A><BR><BR>Why great caution?

<A NAME="992"></A><BR>Do you not remark, I said, how great is the evil which dialectic has 
<A NAME="993"></A>introduced?
<A NAME="994"></A><BR><BR>What evil? he said.
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>The students of the art are filled with lawlessness.
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>Quite true, he said.
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>Do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable 
<A NAME="998"></A>in their case? or will you make allowance for them?
<A NAME="999"></A><BR><BR>In what way make allowance?
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>I want you, I said, by way of parallel, to imagine a supposititious 
<A NAME="1001"></A>son who is brought up in great wealth; he is one of a great and numerous 
<A NAME="1002"></A>family, and has many flatterers. When he grows up to manhood, he learns 
<A NAME="1003"></A>that his alleged are not his real parents; but who the real are he is unable 
<A NAME="1004"></A>to discover. Can you guess how he will be likely to behave towards his 
<A NAME="1005"></A>flatterers and his supposed parents, first of all during the period when 
<A NAME="1006"></A>he is ignorant of the false relation, and then again when he knows? Or 
<A NAME="1007"></A>shall I guess for you?
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR><BR>If you please.

<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>Then I should say, that while he is ignorant of the truth he will be 
<A NAME="1010"></A>likely to honour his father and his mother and his supposed relations more 
<A NAME="1011"></A>than the flatterers; he will be less inclined to neglect them when in need, 
<A NAME="1012"></A>or to do or say anything against them; and he will be less willing to disobey 
<A NAME="1013"></A>them in any important matter.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>He will.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>But when he has made the discovery, I should imagine that he would 
<A NAME="1016"></A>diminish his honour and regard for them, and would become more devoted 
<A NAME="1017"></A>to the flatterers; their influence over him would greatly increase; he 
<A NAME="1018"></A>would now live after their ways, and openly associate with them, and, unless 
<A NAME="1019"></A>he were of an unusually good disposition, he would trouble himself no more 
<A NAME="1020"></A>about his supposed parents or other relations.
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR><BR>Well, all that is very probable. But how is the image applicable 
<A NAME="1022"></A>to the disciples of philosophy?
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR><BR>In this way: you know that there are certain principles about justice 
<A NAME="1024"></A>and honour, which were taught us in childhood, and under their parental 
<A NAME="1025"></A>authority we have been brought up, obeying and honouring 

<A NAME="1026"></A>them.
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>There are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure which flatter 
<A NAME="1029"></A>and attract the soul, but do not influence those of us who have any sense 
<A NAME="1030"></A>of right, and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of their 
<A NAME="1031"></A>fathers.
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>Now, when a man is in this state, and the questioning spirit asks what 
<A NAME="1034"></A>is fair or honourable, and he answers as the legislator has taught him, 
<A NAME="1035"></A>and then arguments many and diverse refute his words, until he is driven 
<A NAME="1036"></A>into believing that nothing is honourable any more than dishonourable, 
<A NAME="1037"></A>or just and good any more than the reverse, and so of all the notions which 
<A NAME="1038"></A>he most valued, do you think that he will still honour and obey them as 
<A NAME="1039"></A>before?
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>And when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as heretofore, 
<A NAME="1042"></A>and he fails to discover the true, can he be expected to pursue any life 

<A NAME="1043"></A>other than that which flatters his desires?
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR><BR>He cannot.
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>And from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of 
<A NAME="1046"></A>it?
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR><BR>Unquestionably.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>Now all this is very natural in students of philosophy such as I have 
<A NAME="1049"></A>described, and also, as I was just now saying, most 
<A NAME="1050"></A>excusable.
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; and, I may add, pitiable.
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>Therefore, that your feelings may not be moved to pity about our citizens 
<A NAME="1053"></A>who are now thirty years of age, every care must be taken in introducing 
<A NAME="1054"></A>them to dialectic.
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>There is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too early; 
<A NAME="1057"></A>for youngsters, as you may have observed, when they first get the taste 
<A NAME="1058"></A>in their mouths, argue for amusement, and are always contradicting and 
<A NAME="1059"></A>refuting others in imitation of those who refute them; like puppy-dogs, 

<A NAME="1060"></A>they rejoice in pulling and tearing at all who come near 
<A NAME="1061"></A>them.
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, there is nothing which they like 
<A NAME="1063"></A>better.
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>And when they have made many conquests and received defeats at the 
<A NAME="1065"></A>hands of many, they violently and speedily get into a way of not believing 
<A NAME="1066"></A>anything which they believed before, and hence, not only they, but philosophy 
<A NAME="1067"></A>and all that relates to it is apt to have a bad name with the rest of the 
<A NAME="1068"></A>world.
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR><BR>Too true, he said.
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>But when a man begins to get older, he will no longer be guilty of 
<A NAME="1071"></A>such insanity; he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for truth, 
<A NAME="1072"></A>and not the eristic, who is contradicting for the sake of amusement; and 
<A NAME="1073"></A>the greater moderation of his character will increase instead of diminishing 
<A NAME="1074"></A>the honour of the pursuit.
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>And did we not make special provision for this, when we said that the 

<A NAME="1077"></A>disciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast, not, as now, 
<A NAME="1078"></A>any chance aspirant or intruder?
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>Suppose, I said, the study of philosophy to take the place of gymnastics 
<A NAME="1081"></A>and to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively for twice 
<A NAME="1082"></A>the number of years which were passed in bodily exercise --will that be 
<A NAME="1083"></A>enough?
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR><BR>Would you say six or four years? he asked.
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>Say five years, I replied; at the end of the time they must be sent 
<A NAME="1086"></A>down again into the den and compelled to hold any military or other office 
<A NAME="1087"></A>which young men are qualified to hold: in this way they will get their 
<A NAME="1088"></A>experience of life, and there will be an opportunity of trying whether, 
<A NAME="1089"></A>when they are drawn all manner of ways by temptation, they will stand firm 
<A NAME="1090"></A>or flinch.
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR><BR>And how long is this stage of their lives to 
<A NAME="1092"></A>last?
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>Fifteen years, I answered; and when they have reached fifty years of 

<A NAME="1094"></A>age, then let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves 
<A NAME="1095"></A>in every action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come at 
<A NAME="1096"></A>last to their consummation; the time has now arrived at which they must 
<A NAME="1097"></A>raise the eye of the soul to the universal light which lightens all things, 
<A NAME="1098"></A>and behold the absolute good; for that is the, pattern according to which 
<A NAME="1099"></A>they are to order the State and the lives of individuals, and the remainder 
<A NAME="1100"></A>of their own lives also; making philosophy their chief pursuit, but, when 
<A NAME="1101"></A>their turn comes, toiling also at politics and ruling for the public good, 
<A NAME="1102"></A>not as though they were performing some heroic action, but simply as a 
<A NAME="1103"></A>matter of duty; and when they have brought up in each generation others 
<A NAME="1104"></A>like themselves and left them in their place to be governors of the State, 
<A NAME="1105"></A>then they will depart to the Islands of the Blest and dwell there; and 
<A NAME="1106"></A>the city will give them public memorials and sacrifices and honour them, 
<A NAME="1107"></A>if the Pythian oracle consent, as demi-gods, but if not, as in any case 
<A NAME="1108"></A>blessed and divine.
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR><BR>You are a sculptor, Socrates, and have made statues of our governors 
<A NAME="1110"></A>faultless in beauty.

<A NAME="1111"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said, Glaucon, and of our governesses too; for you must 
<A NAME="1112"></A>not suppose that what I have been saying applies to men only and not to 
<A NAME="1113"></A>women as far as their natures can go.
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR><BR>There you are right, he said, since we have made them to share 
<A NAME="1115"></A>in all things like the men.
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR><BR>Well, I said, and you would agree (would you not?) that what has 
<A NAME="1117"></A>been said about the State and the government is not a mere dream, and although 
<A NAME="1118"></A>difficult not impossible, but only possible in the way which has been supposed; 
<A NAME="1119"></A>that is to say, when the true philosopher kings are born in a State, one 
<A NAME="1120"></A>or more of them, despising the honours of this present world which they 
<A NAME="1121"></A>deem mean and worthless, esteeming above all things right and the honour 
<A NAME="1122"></A>that springs from right, and regarding justice as the greatest and most 
<A NAME="1123"></A>necessary of all things, whose ministers they are, and whose principles 
<A NAME="1124"></A>will be exalted by them when they set in order their own 
<A NAME="1125"></A>city?
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR><BR>How will they proceed?
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>They will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants 

<A NAME="1128"></A>of the city who are more than ten years old, and will take possession of 
<A NAME="1129"></A>their children, who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents; 
<A NAME="1130"></A>these they will train in their own habits and laws, I mean in the laws 
<A NAME="1131"></A>which we have given them: and in this way the State and constitution of 
<A NAME="1132"></A>which we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness, and 
<A NAME="1133"></A>the nation which has such a constitution will gain most.
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that will be the best way. And I think, Socrates, that you 
<A NAME="1135"></A>have very well described how, if ever, such a constitution might come into 
<A NAME="1136"></A>being.
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR><BR>Enough then of the perfect State, and of the man who bears its 
<A NAME="1138"></A>image --there is no difficulty in seeing how we shall describe 
<A NAME="1139"></A>him.
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR><BR>There is no difficulty, he replied; and I agree with you in thinking 
<A NAME="1141"></A>that nothing more need be said.
