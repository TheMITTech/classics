<A NAME="21"></A>Cephalus rehearses a dialogue which is supposed to have been narrated in 
<A NAME="22"></A>his presence by Antiphon, the half-brother of Adeimantus and Glaucon, to 
certain Clazomenians.<BR></BLOCKQUOTE><HR SIZE="1" COLOR="990033" NOSHADE><BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR>We had come from our home at Clazomenae to Athens, and met Adeimantus 
<A NAME="24"></A>and Glaucon in the Agora. Welcome, Cephalus, said Adeimantus, taking me 
<A NAME="25"></A>by the hand; is there anything which we can do for you in 
<A NAME="26"></A>Athens?
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>Yes; that is why I am here; I wish to ask a favour of 
<A NAME="28"></A>you.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>What may that be? he said.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>I want you to tell me the name of your half brother, which I have forgotten; 
<A NAME="31"></A>he was a mere child when I last came hither from Clazomenae, but that was 
<A NAME="32"></A>a long time ago; his father's name, if I remember rightly, was 
<A NAME="33"></A>Pyrilampes?
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, and the name of our brother, Antiphon; but why do 
<A NAME="35"></A>you ask?
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>Let me introduce some countrymen of mine, I said; they are lovers 
<A NAME="37"></A>of philosophy, and have heard that Antiphon was intimate with a certain 
<A NAME="38"></A>Pythodorus, a friend of Zeno, and remembers a conversation which took place 
<A NAME="39"></A>between Socrates, Zeno, and Parmenides many years ago, Pythodorus having 
<A NAME="40"></A>often recited it to him.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>Quite true.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>And could we hear it? I asked.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Nothing easier, he replied; when he was a youth he made a careful study 
<A NAME="44"></A>of the piece; at present his thoughts run in another direction; like his 
<A NAME="45"></A>grandfather Antiphon he is devoted to horses. But, if that is what you 
<A NAME="46"></A>want, let us go and look for him; he dwells at Melita, which is quite near, 
<A NAME="47"></A>and he has only just left us to go home.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly we went to look for him; he was at home, and in the 
<A NAME="49"></A>act of giving a bridle to a smith to be fitted. When he had done with the 
<A NAME="50"></A>smith, his brothers told him the purpose of our visit; and he saluted me 
<A NAME="51"></A>as an acquaintance whom he remembered from my former visit, and we asked 
<A NAME="52"></A>him to repeat the dialogue. At first he was not very willing, and complained 
<A NAME="53"></A>of the trouble, but at length he consented. He told us that Pythodorus 
<A NAME="54"></A>had described to him the appearance of Parmenides and Zeno; they came to 
<A NAME="55"></A>Athens, as he said, at the great Panathenaea; the former was, at the time 
<A NAME="56"></A>of his visit, about 65 years old, very white with age, but well favoured. 
<A NAME="57"></A>Zeno was nearly 40 years of age, tall and fair to look upon; in the days 
<A NAME="58"></A>of his youth he was reported to have been beloved by Parmenides. He said 
<A NAME="59"></A>that they lodged with Pythodorus in the Ceramicus, outside the wall, whither 
<A NAME="60"></A>Socrates, then a very young man, came to see them, and many others with 
<A NAME="61"></A>him; they wanted to hear the writings of Zeno, which had been brought to 
<A NAME="62"></A>Athens for the first time on the occasion of their visit. These Zeno himself 
<A NAME="63"></A>read to them in the absence of Parmenides, and had very nearly finished 
<A NAME="64"></A>when Pythodorus entered, and with him Parmenides and Aristoteles who was 
<A NAME="65"></A>afterwards one of the Thirty, and heard the little that remained of the 
<A NAME="66"></A>dialogue. Pythodorus had heard Zeno repeat them before.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>When the recitation was completed, Socrates requested that the 
<A NAME="68"></A>first thesis of the first argument might be read over again, and this having 
<A NAME="69"></A>been done, he said: What is your meaning, Zeno? Do you maintain that if 
<A NAME="70"></A>being is many, it must be both like and unlike, and that this is impossible, 
<A NAME="71"></A>for neither can the like be unlike, nor the unlike like-is that your 
<A NAME="72"></A>position?
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Just so, said Zeno.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>And if the unlike cannot be like, or the like unlike, then according 
<A NAME="75"></A>to you, being could not be many; for this would involve an impossibility. 
<A NAME="76"></A>In all that you say have you any other purpose except to disprove the being 
<A NAME="77"></A>of the many? and is not each division of your treatise intended to furnish 
<A NAME="78"></A>a separate proof of this, there being in all as many proofs of the not-being 
<A NAME="79"></A>of the many as you have composed arguments? Is that your meaning, or have 
<A NAME="80"></A>I misunderstood you?
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>No, said Zeno; you have correctly understood my general 
<A NAME="82"></A>purpose.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>I see, Parmenides, said Socrates, that Zeno would like to be not only 
<A NAME="84"></A>one with you in friendship but your second self in his writings too; he 
<A NAME="85"></A>puts what you say in another way, and would fain make believe that he is 
<A NAME="86"></A>telling us something which is new. For you, in your poems, say The All 
<A NAME="87"></A>is one, and of this you adduce excellent proofs; and he on the other hand 
<A NAME="88"></A>says There is no many; and on behalf of this he offers overwhelming evidence. 
<A NAME="89"></A>You affirm unity, he denies plurality. And so you deceive the world into 
<A NAME="90"></A>believing that you are saying different things when really you are saying 
<A NAME="91"></A>much the same. This is a strain of art beyond the reach of most of 
<A NAME="92"></A>us.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>Yes, Socrates, said Zeno. But although you are as keen as a Spartan 
<A NAME="94"></A>hound in pursuing the track, you do not fully apprehend the true motive 
<A NAME="95"></A>of the composition, which is not really such an artificial work as you 
<A NAME="96"></A>imagine; for what you speak of was an accident; there was no pretence of 
<A NAME="97"></A>a great purpose; nor any serious intention of deceiving the world. The 
<A NAME="98"></A>truth is, that these writings of mine were meant to protect the arguments 
<A NAME="99"></A>of Parmenides against those who make fun of him and seek to show the many 
<A NAME="100"></A>ridiculous and contradictory results which they suppose to follow from 
<A NAME="101"></A>the affirmation of the one. My answer is addressed to the partisans of 
<A NAME="102"></A>the many, whose attack I return with interest by retorting upon them that 
<A NAME="103"></A>their hypothesis of the being of many, if carried out, appears to be still 
<A NAME="104"></A>more ridiculous than the hypothesis of the being of one. Zeal for my master 
<A NAME="105"></A>led me to write the book in the days of my youth, but some one stole the 
<A NAME="106"></A>copy; and therefore I had no choice whether it should be published or not; 
<A NAME="107"></A>the motive, however, of writing, was not the ambition of an elder man, 
<A NAME="108"></A>but the pugnacity of a young one. This you do not seem to see, Socrates; 
<A NAME="109"></A>though in other respects, as I was saying, your notion is a very just 
<A NAME="110"></A>one.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>I understand, said Socrates, and quite accept your account. But 
<A NAME="112"></A>tell me, Zeno, do you not further think that there is an idea of likeness 
<A NAME="113"></A>in itself, and another idea of unlikeness, which is the opposite of likeness, 
<A NAME="114"></A>and that in these two, you and I and all other things to which we apply 
<A NAME="115"></A>the term many, participate-things which participate in likeness become 
<A NAME="116"></A>in that degree and manner like; and so far as they participate in unlikeness 
<A NAME="117"></A>become in that degree unlike, or both like and unlike in the degree in 
<A NAME="118"></A>which they participate in both? And may not all things partake of both 
<A NAME="119"></A>opposites, and be both like and unlike, by reason of this participation?-Where 
<A NAME="120"></A>is the wonder? Now if a person could prove the absolute like to become 
<A NAME="121"></A>unlike, or the absolute unlike to become like, that, in my opinion, would 
<A NAME="122"></A>indeed be a wonder; but there is nothing extraordinary, Zeno, in showing 
<A NAME="123"></A>that the things which only partake of likeness and unlikeness experience 
<A NAME="124"></A>both. Nor, again, if a person were to show that all is one by partaking 
<A NAME="125"></A>of one, and at the same time many by partaking of many, would that be very 
<A NAME="126"></A>astonishing. But if he were to show me that the absolute one was many, 
<A NAME="127"></A>or the absolute many one, I should be truly amazed. And so of all the rest: 
<A NAME="128"></A>I should be surprised to hear that the natures or ideas themselves had 
<A NAME="129"></A>these opposite qualities; but not if a person wanted to prove of me that 
<A NAME="130"></A>I was many and also one. When he wanted to show that I was many he would 
<A NAME="131"></A>say that I have a right and a left side, and a front and a back, and an 
<A NAME="132"></A>upper and a lower half, for I cannot deny that I partake of multitude; 
<A NAME="133"></A>when, on the other hand, he wants to prove that I am one, he will say, 
<A NAME="134"></A>that we who are here assembled are seven, and that I am one and partake 
<A NAME="135"></A>of the one. In both instances he proves his case. So again, if a person 
<A NAME="136"></A>shows that such things as wood, stones, and the like, being many are also 
<A NAME="137"></A>one, we admit that he shows the coexistence the one and many, but he does 
<A NAME="138"></A>not show that the many are one or the one many; he is uttering not a paradox 
<A NAME="139"></A>but a truism. If however, as I just now suggested, some one were to abstract 
<A NAME="140"></A>simple notions of like, unlike, one, many, rest, motion, and similar ideas, 
<A NAME="141"></A>and then to show that these admit of admixture and separation in themselves, 
<A NAME="142"></A>I should be very much astonished. This part of the argument appears to 
<A NAME="143"></A>be treated by you, Zeno, in a very spirited manner; but, as I was saying, 
<A NAME="144"></A>I should be far more amazed if any one found in the ideas themselves which 
<A NAME="145"></A>are apprehended by reason, the same puzzle and entanglement which you have 
<A NAME="146"></A>shown to exist in visible objects.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>While Socrates was speaking, Pythodorus thought that Parmenides 
<A NAME="148"></A>and Zeno were not altogether pleased at the successive steps of the argument; 
<A NAME="149"></A>but still they gave the closest attention and often looked at one another, 
<A NAME="150"></A>and smiled as if in admiration of him. When he had finished, Parmenides 
<A NAME="151"></A>expressed their feelings in the following words:-
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>Socrates, he said, I admire the bent of your mind towards philosophy; 
<A NAME="153"></A>tell me now, was this your own distinction between ideas in themselves 
<A NAME="154"></A>and the things which partake of them? and do you think that there is an 
<A NAME="155"></A>idea of likeness apart from the likeness which we possess, and of the one 
<A NAME="156"></A>and many, and of the other things which Zeno mentioned?
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>I think that there are such ideas, said Socrates.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Parmenides proceeded: And would you also make absolute ideas of the 
<A NAME="159"></A>just and the beautiful and the good, and of all that 
<A NAME="160"></A>class?
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, I should.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>And would you make an idea of man apart from us and from all other 
<A NAME="163"></A>human creatures, or of fire and water?
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>I am often undecided, Parmenides, as to whether I ought to include 
<A NAME="165"></A>them or not.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>And would you feel equally undecided, Socrates, about things of 
<A NAME="167"></A>which the mention may provoke a smile?-I mean such things as hair, mud, 
<A NAME="168"></A>dirt, or anything else which is vile and paltry; would you suppose that 
<A NAME="169"></A>each of these has an idea distinct from the actual objects with which we 
<A NAME="170"></A>come into contact, or not?
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not, said Socrates; visible things like these are such 
<A NAME="172"></A>as they appear to us, and I am afraid that there would be an absurdity 
<A NAME="173"></A>in assuming any idea of them, although I sometimes get disturbed, and begin 
<A NAME="174"></A>to think that there is nothing without an idea; but then again, when I 
<A NAME="175"></A>have taken up this position, I run away, because I am afraid that I may 
<A NAME="176"></A>fall into a bottomless pit of nonsense, and perish; and so I return to 
<A NAME="177"></A>the ideas of which I was just now speaking, and occupy myself with 
<A NAME="178"></A>them.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>Yes, Socrates, said Parmenides; that is because you are still young; 
<A NAME="180"></A>the time will come, if I am not mistaken, when philosophy will have a firmer 
<A NAME="181"></A>grasp of you, and then you will not despise even the meanest things; at 
<A NAME="182"></A>your age, you are too much disposed to regard opinions of men. But I should 
<A NAME="183"></A>like to know whether you mean that there are certain ideas of which all 
<A NAME="184"></A>other things partake, and from which they derive their names; that similars, 
<A NAME="185"></A>for example, become similar, because they partake of similarity; and great 
<A NAME="186"></A>things become great, because they partake of greatness; and that just and 
<A NAME="187"></A>beautiful things become just and beautiful, because they partake of justice 
<A NAME="188"></A>and beauty?
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>Yes, certainly, said Socrates that is my meaning.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Then each individual partakes either of the whole of the idea or else 
<A NAME="191"></A>of a part of the idea? Can there be any other mode of 
<A NAME="192"></A>participation?
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>There cannot be, he said.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Then do you think that the whole idea is one, and yet, being one, is 
<A NAME="195"></A>in each one of the many?
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>Why not, Parmenides? said Socrates.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>Because one and the same thing will exist as a whole at the same time 
<A NAME="198"></A>in many separate individuals, and will therefore be in a state of separation 
<A NAME="199"></A>from itself.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>Nay, but the idea may be like the day which is one and the same 
<A NAME="201"></A>in many places at once, and yet continuous with itself; in this way each 
<A NAME="202"></A>idea may be one; and the same in all at the same time.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>I like your way, Socrates, of making one in many places at once. 
<A NAME="204"></A>You mean to say, that if I were to spread out a sail and cover a number 
<A NAME="205"></A>of men, there would be one whole including many-is not that your 
<A NAME="206"></A>meaning?
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>I think so.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>And would you say that the whole sail includes each man, or a part 
<A NAME="209"></A>of it only, and different parts different men?
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>The latter.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Then, Socrates, the ideas themselves will be divisible, and things 
<A NAME="212"></A>which participate in them will have a part of them only and not the whole 
<A NAME="213"></A>idea existing in each of them?
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>That seems to follow.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Then would you like to say, Socrates, that the one idea is really divisible 
<A NAME="216"></A>and yet remains one?
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not, he said.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Suppose that you divide absolute greatness, and that of the many great 
<A NAME="219"></A>things, each one is great in virtue of a portion of greatness less than 
<A NAME="220"></A>absolute greatness-is that conceivable?
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>No.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Or will each equal thing, if possessing some small portion of equality 
<A NAME="223"></A>less than absolute equality, be equal to some other thing by virtue of 
<A NAME="224"></A>that portion only?
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Or suppose one of us to have a portion of smallness; this is but a 
<A NAME="227"></A>part of the small, and therefore the absolutely small is greater; if the 
<A NAME="228"></A>absolutely small be greater, that to which the part of the small is added 
<A NAME="229"></A>will be smaller and not greater than before.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>How absurd!
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Then in what way, Socrates, will all things participate in the ideas, 
<A NAME="232"></A>if they are unable to participate in them either as parts or 
<A NAME="233"></A>wholes?
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, he said, you have asked a question which is not easily 
<A NAME="235"></A>answered.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>Well, said Parmenides, and what do you say of another 
<A NAME="237"></A>question?
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>What question?
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>I imagine that the way in which you are led to assume one idea of each 
<A NAME="240"></A>kind is as follows: -You see a number of great objects, and when you look 
<A NAME="241"></A>at them there seems to you to be one and the same idea (or nature) in them 
<A NAME="242"></A>all; hence you conceive of greatness as one.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>Very true, said Socrates.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>And if you go on and allow your mind in like manner to embrace in one 
<A NAME="245"></A>view the idea of greatness and of great things which are not the idea, 
<A NAME="246"></A>and -to compare them, will not another greatness arise, which will appear 
<A NAME="247"></A>to be the source of all these?
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>It would seem so.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Then another idea of greatness now comes into view over and above absolute 
<A NAME="250"></A>greatness, and the individuals which partake of it; and then another, over 
<A NAME="251"></A>and above all these, by virtue of which they will all be great, and so 
<A NAME="252"></A>each idea instead of being one will be infinitely multiplied.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>But may not the ideas, asked Socrates, be thoughts only, and have 
<A NAME="254"></A>no proper existence except in our minds, Parmenides? For in that case each 
<A NAME="255"></A>idea may still be one, and not experience this infinite 
<A NAME="256"></A>multiplication.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>And can there be individual thoughts which are thoughts of 
<A NAME="258"></A>nothing?
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Impossible, he said.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>The thought must be of something?
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Of something which is or which is not?
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Of something which is.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Must it not be of a single something, which the thought recognizes 
<A NAME="265"></A>as attaching to all, being a single form or nature?
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>And will not the something which is apprehended as one and the same 
<A NAME="268"></A>in all, be an idea?
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>From that, again, there is no escape.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Then, said Parmenides, if you say that everything else participates 
<A NAME="271"></A>in the ideas, must you not say either that everything is made up of thoughts, 
<A NAME="272"></A>and that all things think; or that they are thoughts but have no 
<A NAME="273"></A>thought?
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>The latter view, Parmenides, is no more rational than the previous 
<A NAME="275"></A>one. In my opinion, the ideas are, as it were, patterns fixed in nature, 
<A NAME="276"></A>and other things are like them, and resemblances of them-what is meant 
<A NAME="277"></A>by the participation of other things in the ideas, is really assimilation 
<A NAME="278"></A>to them.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>But if, said he, the individual is like the idea, must not the 
<A NAME="280"></A>idea also be like the individual, in so far as the individual is a resemblance 
<A NAME="281"></A>of the idea? That which is like, cannot be conceived of as other than the 
<A NAME="282"></A>like of like.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>And when two things are alike, must they not partake of the same 
<A NAME="285"></A>idea?
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>They must.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>And will not that of which the two partake, and which makes them alike, 
<A NAME="288"></A>be the idea itself?
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Then the idea cannot be like the individual, or the individual like 
<A NAME="291"></A>the idea; for if they are alike, some further idea of likeness will always 
<A NAME="292"></A>be coming to light, and if that be like anything else, another; and new 
<A NAME="293"></A>ideas will be always arising, if the idea resembles that which partakes 
<A NAME="294"></A>of it?
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>Quite true.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>The theory, then that other things participate in the ideas by resemblance, 
<A NAME="297"></A>has to be given up, and some other mode of participation 
<A NAME="298"></A>devised?
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>It would seem so.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>Do you see then, Socrates, how great is the difficulty of affirming 
<A NAME="301"></A>the ideas to be absolute?
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>Yes, indeed.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>And, further, let me say that as yet you only understand a small part 
<A NAME="304"></A>of the difficulty which is involved if you make of each thing a single 
<A NAME="305"></A>idea, parting it off from other things.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>What difficulty? he said.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>There are many, but the greatest of all is this:-If an opponent argues 
<A NAME="308"></A>that these ideas, being such as we say they ought to be, must remain unknown, 
<A NAME="309"></A>no one can prove to him that he is wrong, unless he who denies their existence 
<A NAME="310"></A>be a man of great ability and knowledge, and is willing to follow a long 
<A NAME="311"></A>and laborious demonstration; he will remain unconvinced, and still insist 
<A NAME="312"></A>that they cannot be known.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean, Parmenides? said Socrates.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>In the first place, I think, Socrates, that you, or any one who maintains 
<A NAME="315"></A>the existence of absolute essences, will admit that they cannot exist in 
<A NAME="316"></A>us.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>No, said Socrates; for then they would be no longer 
<A NAME="318"></A>absolute.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>True, he said; and therefore when ideas are what they are in relation 
<A NAME="320"></A>to one another, their essence is determined by a relation among themselves, 
<A NAME="321"></A>and has nothing to do with the resemblances, or whatever they are to be 
<A NAME="322"></A>termed, which are in our sphere, and from which we receive this or that 
<A NAME="323"></A>name when we partake of them. And the things which are within our sphere 
<A NAME="324"></A>and have the same names with them, are likewise only relative to one another, 
<A NAME="325"></A>and not to the ideas which have the same names with them, but belong to 
<A NAME="326"></A>themselves and not to them.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean? said Socrates.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>I may illustrate my meaning in this way, said Parmenides:-A master 
<A NAME="329"></A>has a slave; now there is nothing absolute in the relation between them, 
<A NAME="330"></A>which is simply a relation of one man to another. But there is also an 
<A NAME="331"></A>idea of mastership in the abstract, which is relative to the idea of slavery 
<A NAME="332"></A>in the abstract. These natures have nothing to do with us, nor we with 
<A NAME="333"></A>them; they are concerned with themselves only, and we with ourselves. Do 
<A NAME="334"></A>you see my meaning?
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>Yes, said Socrates, I quite see your meaning.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>And will not knowledge-I mean absolute knowledge-answer to absolute 
<A NAME="337"></A>truth?
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>And each kind of absolute knowledge will answer to each kind of absolute 
<A NAME="340"></A>being?
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>But the knowledge which we have, will answer to the truth which we 
<A NAME="343"></A>have; and again, each kind of knowledge which we have, will be a knowledge 
<A NAME="344"></A>of each kind of being which we have?
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>But the ideas themselves, as you admit, we have not, and cannot 
<A NAME="347"></A>have?
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>No, we cannot.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>And the absolute natures or kinds are known severally by the absolute 
<A NAME="350"></A>idea of knowledge?
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>And we have not got the idea of knowledge?
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>No.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>Then none of the ideas are known to us, because we have no share in 
<A NAME="355"></A>absolute knowledge?
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>I suppose not.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Then the nature of the beautiful in itself, and of the good in itself, 
<A NAME="358"></A>and all other ideas which we suppose to exist absolutely, are unknown to 
<A NAME="359"></A>us?
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>It would seem so.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>I think that there is a stranger consequence still.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>What is it?
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>Would you, or would you not say, that absolute knowledge, if there 
<A NAME="364"></A>is such a thing, must be a far more exact knowledge than our knowledge; 
<A NAME="365"></A>and the same of beauty and of the rest?
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>And if there be such a thing as participation in absolute knowledge, 
<A NAME="368"></A>no one is more likely than God to have this most exact 
<A NAME="369"></A>knowledge?
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>But then, will God, having absolute knowledge, have a knowledge of 
<A NAME="372"></A>human things?
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>Why not?
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Because, Socrates, said Parmenides, we have admitted that the ideas 
<A NAME="375"></A>are not valid in relation to human things; nor human things in relation 
<A NAME="376"></A>to them; the relations of either are limited to their respective 
<A NAME="377"></A>spheres.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that has been admitted.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>And if God has this perfect authority, and perfect knowledge, his authority 
<A NAME="380"></A>cannot rule us, nor his knowledge know us, or any human thing; just as 
<A NAME="381"></A>our authority does not extend to the gods, nor our knowledge know anything 
<A NAME="382"></A>which is divine, so by parity of reason they, being gods, are not our masters, 
<A NAME="383"></A>neither do they know the things of men.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>Yet, surely, said Socrates, to deprive God of knowledge is 
<A NAME="385"></A>monstrous.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>These, Socrates, said Parmenides, are a few, and only a few of 
<A NAME="387"></A>the difficulties in which we are involved if ideas really are and we determine 
<A NAME="388"></A>each one of them to be an absolute unity. He who hears what may be said 
<A NAME="389"></A>against them will deny the very existence of them-and even if they do exist, 
<A NAME="390"></A>he will say that they must of necessity be unknown to man; and he will 
<A NAME="391"></A>seem to have reason on his side, and as we were remarking just now, will 
<A NAME="392"></A>be very difficult to convince; a man must be gifted with very considerable 
<A NAME="393"></A>ability before he can learn that everything has a class and an absolute 
<A NAME="394"></A>essence; and still more remarkable will he be who discovers all these things 
<A NAME="395"></A>for himself, and having thoroughly investigated them is able to teach them 
<A NAME="396"></A>to others.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>I agree with you, Parmenides, said Socrates; and what you say is 
<A NAME="398"></A>very much to my mind.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>And yet, Socrates, said Parmenides, if a man, fixing his attention 
<A NAME="400"></A>on these and the like difficulties, does away with ideas of things and 
<A NAME="401"></A>will not admit that every individual thing has its own determinate idea 
<A NAME="402"></A>which is always one and the same, he will have nothing on which his mind 
<A NAME="403"></A>can rest; and so he will utterly destroy the power of reasoning, as you 
<A NAME="404"></A>seem to me to have particularly noted.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>But, then, what is to become of philosophy? Whither shall we turn, 
<A NAME="407"></A>if the ideas are unknown?
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>I certainly do not see my way at present.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Yes, said Parmenides; and I think that this arises, Socrates, out of 
<A NAME="410"></A>your attempting to define the beautiful, the just, the good, and the ideas 
<A NAME="411"></A>generally, without sufficient previous training. I noticed your deficiency, 
<A NAME="412"></A>when I heard you talking here with your friend Aristoteles, the day before 
<A NAME="413"></A>yesterday. The impulse that carries you towards philosophy is assuredly 
<A NAME="414"></A>noble and divine; but there is an art which is called by the vulgar idle 
<A NAME="415"></A>talking, and which is of imagined to be useless; in that you must train 
<A NAME="416"></A>and exercise yourself, now that you are young, or truth will elude your 
<A NAME="417"></A>grasp.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>And what is the nature of this exercise, Parmenides, which you 
<A NAME="419"></A>would recommend?
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>That which you heard Zeno practising; at the same time, I give 
<A NAME="421"></A>you credit for saying to him that you did not care to examine the perplexity 
<A NAME="422"></A>in reference to visible things, or to consider the question that way; but 
<A NAME="423"></A>only in reference to objects of thought, and to what may be called 
<A NAME="424"></A>ideas.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>Why, yes, he said, there appears to me to be no difficulty in showing 
<A NAME="426"></A>by this method that visible things are like and unlike and may experience 
<A NAME="427"></A>anything.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>Quite true, said Parmenides; but I think that you should go a step 
<A NAME="429"></A>further, and consider not only the consequences which flow from a given 
<A NAME="430"></A>hypothesis, but also the consequences which flow from denying the hypothesis; 
<A NAME="431"></A>and that will be still better training for you.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean? he said.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>I mean, for example, that in the case of this very hypothesis of Zeno's 
<A NAME="434"></A>about the many, you should inquire not only what will be the consequences 
<A NAME="435"></A>to the many in relation to themselves and to the one, and to the one in 
<A NAME="436"></A>relation to itself and the many, on the hypothesis of the being of the 
<A NAME="437"></A>many, but also what will be the consequences to the one and the many in 
<A NAME="438"></A>their relation to themselves and to each other, on the opposite hypothesis. 
<A NAME="439"></A>Or, again, if likeness is or is not, what will be the consequences in either 
<A NAME="440"></A>of these cases to the subjects of the hypothesis, and to other things, 
<A NAME="441"></A>in relation both to themselves and to one another, and so of unlikeness; 
<A NAME="442"></A>and the same holds good of motion and rest, of generation and destruction, 
<A NAME="443"></A>and even of being and not-being. In a word, when you suppose anything to 
<A NAME="444"></A>be or not to be, or to be in any way affected, you must look at the consequences 
<A NAME="445"></A>in relation to the thing itself, and to any other things which you choose-to 
<A NAME="446"></A>each of them singly, to more than one, and to all; and so of other things, 
<A NAME="447"></A>you must look at them in relation to themselves and to anything else which 
<A NAME="448"></A>you suppose either to be or not to be, if you would train yourself perfectly 
<A NAME="449"></A>and see the real truth.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>That, Parmenides, is a tremendous business of which you speak, 
<A NAME="451"></A>and I do not quite understand you; will you take some hypothesis and go 
<A NAME="452"></A>through the steps?-then I shall apprehend you better.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR>That, Socrates, is a serious task to impose on a man of my 
<A NAME="454"></A>years.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>Then will you, Zeno? said Socrates.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Zeno answered with a smile:-Let us make our petition to Parmenides 
<A NAME="457"></A>himself, who is quite right in saying that you are hardly aware of the 
<A NAME="458"></A>extent of the task which you are imposing on him; and if there were more 
<A NAME="459"></A>of us I should not ask him, for these are not subjects which any one, especially 
<A NAME="460"></A>at his age, can well speak of before a large audience; most people are 
<A NAME="461"></A>not aware that this round-about progress through all things is the only 
<A NAME="462"></A>way in which the mind can attain truth and wisdom. And therefore, Parmenides, 
<A NAME="463"></A>I join in the request of Socrates, that I may hear the process again which 
<A NAME="464"></A>I have not heard for a long time.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>When Zeno had thus spoken, Pythodorus, according to Antiphon's 
<A NAME="466"></A>report of him, said, that he himself and Aristoteles and the whole company 
<A NAME="467"></A>entreated Parmenides to give an example of the process. I cannot refuse, 
<A NAME="468"></A>said Parmenides; and yet I feel rather like Ibycus, who, when in his old 
<A NAME="469"></A>age, against his will, he fell in love, compared himself to an old racehorse, 
<A NAME="470"></A>who was about to run in a chariot race, shaking with fear at the course 
<A NAME="471"></A>he knew so well-this was his simile of himself. And I also experience a 
<A NAME="472"></A>trembling when I remember through what an ocean of words I have to wade 
<A NAME="473"></A>at my time of life. But I must indulge you, as Zeno says that I ought, 
<A NAME="474"></A>and we are alone. Where shall I begin? And what shall be our first hypothesis, 
<A NAME="475"></A>if I am to attempt this laborious pastime? Shall I begin with myself, and 
<A NAME="476"></A>take my own hypothesis the one? and consider the consequences which follow 
<A NAME="477"></A>on the supposition either of the being or of the not being of 
<A NAME="478"></A>one?
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>By all means, said Zeno.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>And who will answer me? he said. Shall I propose the youngest? He will 
<A NAME="481"></A>not make difficulties and will be the most likely to say what he thinks; 
<A NAME="482"></A>and his answers will give me time to breathe.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>I am the one whom you mean, Parmenides, said Aristoteles; for I 
<A NAME="484"></A>am the youngest and at your service. Ask, and I will 
<A NAME="485"></A>answer.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>Parmenides proceeded: If one is, he said, the one cannot be 
<A NAME="487"></A>many?
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Then the one cannot have parts, and cannot be a 
<A NAME="490"></A>whole?
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>Why not?
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>Because every part is part of a whole; is it not?
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>And what is a whole? would not that of which no part is wanting be 
<A NAME="495"></A>a whole?
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Then, in either case, the one would be made up of parts; both as being 
<A NAME="498"></A>a whole, and also as having parts?
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR>To be sure.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>And in either case, the one would be many, and not 
<A NAME="501"></A>one?
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>But, surely, it ought to be one and not many?
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>It ought.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Then, if the one is to remain one, it will not be a whole, and will 
<A NAME="506"></A>not have parts?
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>No.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>But if it has no parts, it will have neither beginning, middle, nor 
<A NAME="509"></A>end; for these would of course be parts of it.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>Right.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>But then, again, a beginning and an end are the limits of 
<A NAME="512"></A>everything?
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Then the one, having neither beginning nor end, is 
<A NAME="515"></A>unlimited?
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Yes, unlimited.
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>And therefore formless; for it cannot partake either of round or 
<A NAME="518"></A>straight.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>But why?
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Why, because the round is that of which all the extreme points are 
<A NAME="521"></A>equidistant from the centre?
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>And the straight is that of which the centre intercepts the view of 
<A NAME="524"></A>the extremes?
<A NAME="525"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Then the one would have parts and would be many, if it partook either 
<A NAME="527"></A>of a straight or of a circular form?
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>Assuredly.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>But having no parts, it will be neither straight nor 
<A NAME="530"></A>round?
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>Right.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>And, being of such a nature, it cannot be in any place, for it cannot 
<A NAME="533"></A>be either in another or in itself.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>How so?
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>Because if it were in another, it would be encircled by that in which 
<A NAME="536"></A>it was, and would touch it at many places and with many parts; but that 
<A NAME="537"></A>which is one and indivisible, and does not partake of a circular nature, 
<A NAME="538"></A>cannot be touched all round in many places.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>But if, on the other hand, one were in itself, it would also be contained 
<A NAME="541"></A>by nothing else but itself; that is to say, if it were really in itself; 
<A NAME="542"></A>for nothing can be in anything which does not contain 
<A NAME="543"></A>it.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>But then, that which contains must be other than that which is contained? 
<A NAME="546"></A>for the same whole cannot do and suffer both at once; and if so, one will 
<A NAME="547"></A>be no longer one, but two?
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Then one cannot be anywhere, either in itself or in 
<A NAME="550"></A>another?
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>No.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Further consider, whether that which is of such a nature can have either 
<A NAME="553"></A>rest or motion.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>Why not?
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Why, because the one, if it were moved, would be either moved in place 
<A NAME="556"></A>or changed in nature; for these are the only kinds of 
<A NAME="557"></A>motion.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>And the one, when it changes and ceases to be itself, cannot be any 
<A NAME="560"></A>longer one.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR>It cannot.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>It cannot therefore experience the sort of motion which is change of 
<A NAME="563"></A>nature?
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>Clearly not.
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Then can the motion of the one be in place?
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Perhaps.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>But if the one moved in place, must it not either move round and round 
<A NAME="568"></A>in the same place, or from one place to another?
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>It must.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>And that which moves in a circle must rest upon a centre; and that 
<A NAME="571"></A>which goes round upon a centre must have parts which are different from 
<A NAME="572"></A>the centre; but that which has no centre and no parts cannot possibly be 
<A NAME="573"></A>carried round upon a centre?
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>But perhaps the motion of the one consists in change of 
<A NAME="576"></A>place?
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Perhaps so, if it moves at all.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>And have we not already shown that it cannot be in 
<A NAME="579"></A>anything?
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Then its coming into being in anything is still more impossible; is 
<A NAME="582"></A>it not?
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR>I do not see why.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>Why, because anything which comes into being in anything, can neither 
<A NAME="585"></A>as yet be in that other thing while still coming into being, nor be altogether 
<A NAME="586"></A>out of it, if already coming into being in it.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>And therefore whatever comes into being in another must have parts, 
<A NAME="589"></A>and then one part may be in, and another part out of that other; but that 
<A NAME="590"></A>which has no parts can never be at one and the same time neither wholly 
<A NAME="591"></A>within nor wholly without anything.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>And is there not a still greater impossibility in that which has no 
<A NAME="594"></A>parts, and is not a whole, coming into being anywhere, since it cannot 
<A NAME="595"></A>come into being either as a part or as a whole?
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Then it does not change place by revolving in the same spot, not by 
<A NAME="598"></A>going somewhere and coming into being in something; nor again, by change 
<A NAME="599"></A>in itself?
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>Then in respect of any kind of motion the one is 
<A NAME="602"></A>immoveable?
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>Immoveable.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>But neither can the one be in anything, as we affirm.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Yes, we said so.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Then it is never in the same?
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>Why not?
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>Because if it were in the same it would be in something.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>And we said that it could not be in itself, and could not be in 
<A NAME="611"></A>other?
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>Then one is never in the same place?
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>It would seem not.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>But that which is never in the same place is never quiet or at 
<A NAME="616"></A>rest?
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Never.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>One then, as would seem, is neither rest nor in 
<A NAME="619"></A>motion?
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>It certainly appears so.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Neither will it be the same with itself or other; nor again, other 
<A NAME="622"></A>than itself or other.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>How is that?
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>If other than itself it would be other than one, and would not be 
<A NAME="625"></A>one.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>And if the same with other, it would be that other, and not itself; 
<A NAME="628"></A>so that upon this supposition too, it would not have the nature of one, 
<A NAME="629"></A>but would be other than one?
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>It would.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Then it will not be the same with other, or other than 
<A NAME="632"></A>itself?
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>It will not.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>Neither will it be other than other, while it remains one; for not 
<A NAME="635"></A>one, but only other, can be other than other, and nothing 
<A NAME="636"></A>else.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Then not by virtue of being one will it be other?
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>But if not by virtue of being one, not by virtue of itself; and if 
<A NAME="641"></A>not by virtue of itself, not itself, and itself not being other at all, 
<A NAME="642"></A>will not be other than anything?
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR>Right.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Neither will one be the same with itself.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>How not?
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Surely the nature of the one is not the nature of the 
<A NAME="647"></A>same.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Why not?
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>It is not when anything becomes the same with anything that it becomes 
<A NAME="650"></A>one.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR>What of that?
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Anything which becomes the same with the many, necessarily becomes 
<A NAME="653"></A>many and not one.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>But, if there were no difference between the one and the same, when 
<A NAME="656"></A>a thing became the same, it would always become one; and when it became 
<A NAME="657"></A>one, the same?
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>And, therefore, if one be the same with itself, it is not one with 
<A NAME="660"></A>itself, and will therefore be one and also not one.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR>Surely that is impossible.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>And therefore the one can neither be other than other, nor the same 
<A NAME="663"></A>with itself.
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>And thus the one can neither be the same, nor other, either in relation 
<A NAME="666"></A>to itself or other?
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>No.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>Neither will the one be like anything or unlike itself or 
<A NAME="669"></A>other.
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Why not?
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Because likeness is sameness of affections.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>And sameness has been shown to be of a nature distinct from 
<A NAME="674"></A>oneness?
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>That has been shown.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>But if the one had any other affection than that of being one, it would 
<A NAME="677"></A>be affected in such a way as to be more than one; which is 
<A NAME="678"></A>impossible.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Then the one can never be so affected as to be the same either with 
<A NAME="681"></A>another or with itself?
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><BR>Clearly not.
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>Then it cannot be like another, or like itself?
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>No.
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>Nor can it be affected so as to be other, for then it would be affected 
<A NAME="686"></A>in such a way as to be more than one.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR>It would.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>That which is affected otherwise than itself or another, will be unlike 
<A NAME="689"></A>itself or another, for sameness of affections is likeness.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>But the one, as appears, never being affected otherwise, is never unlike 
<A NAME="692"></A>itself or other?
<A NAME="693"></A><BR><BR>Never.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Then the one will never be either like or unlike itself or 
<A NAME="695"></A>other?
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Plainly not.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Again, being of this nature, it can neither be equal nor unequal either 
<A NAME="698"></A>to itself or to other.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>How is that?
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>Why, because the one if equal must be of the same measures as that 
<A NAME="701"></A>to which it is equal.
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>And if greater or less than things which are commensurable with it, 
<A NAME="704"></A>the one will have more measures than that which is less, and fewer than 
<A NAME="705"></A>that which is greater?
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>And so of things which are not commensurate with it, the one will have 
<A NAME="708"></A>greater measures than that which is less and smaller than that which is 
<A NAME="709"></A>greater.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>But how can that which does not partake of sameness, have either the 
<A NAME="712"></A>same measures or have anything else the same?
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>And not having the same measures, the one cannot be equal either with 
<A NAME="715"></A>itself or with another?
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR>It appears so.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>But again, whether it have fewer or more measures, it will have as 
<A NAME="718"></A>many parts as it has measures; and thus again the one will be no longer 
<A NAME="719"></A>one but will have as many parts as measures.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR>Right.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>And if it were of one measure, it would be equal to that measure; yet 
<A NAME="722"></A>it has been shown to be incapable of equality.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>It has.
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>Then it will neither partake of one measure, nor of many, nor of few, 
<A NAME="725"></A>nor of the same at all, nor be equal to itself or another; nor be greater 
<A NAME="726"></A>or less than itself, or other?
<A NAME="727"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>Well, and do we suppose that one can be older, or younger than anything, 
<A NAME="729"></A>or of the same age with it?
<A NAME="730"></A><BR><BR>Why not?
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Why, because that which is of the same age with itself or other, must 
<A NAME="732"></A>partake of equality or likeness of time; and we said that the one did not 
<A NAME="733"></A>partake either of equality or of likeness?
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR>We did say so.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>And we also said, that it did not partake of inequality or 
<A NAME="736"></A>unlikeness.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>How then can one, being of this nature, be either older or younger 
<A NAME="739"></A>than anything, or have the same age with it?
<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR>In no way.
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>Then one cannot be older or younger, or of the same age, either with 
<A NAME="742"></A>itself or with another?
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR>Clearly not.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>Then the one, being of this nature, cannot be in time at all; for must 
<A NAME="745"></A>not that which is in time, be always growing older than 
<A NAME="746"></A>itself?
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>And that which is older, must always be older than something which 
<A NAME="749"></A>is younger?
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>Then, that which becomes older than itself, also becomes at the same 
<A NAME="752"></A>time younger than itself, if it is to have something to become older 
<A NAME="753"></A>than.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean?
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>I mean this:-A thing does not need to become different from another 
<A NAME="756"></A>thing which is already different; it is different, and if its different 
<A NAME="757"></A>has become, it has become different; if its different will be, it will 
<A NAME="758"></A>be different; but of that which is becoming different, there cannot have 
<A NAME="759"></A>been, or be about to be, or yet be, a different-the only different possible 
<A NAME="760"></A>is one which is becoming.
<A NAME="761"></A><BR><BR>That is inevitable.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>But, surely, the elder is a difference relative to the younger, and 
<A NAME="763"></A>to nothing else.
<A NAME="764"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>Then that which becomes older than itself must also, at the same time, 
<A NAME="766"></A>become younger than itself?
<A NAME="767"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>But again, it is true that it cannot become for a longer or for a shorter 
<A NAME="769"></A>time than itself, but it must become, and be, and have become, and be about 
<A NAME="770"></A>to be, for the same time with itself?
<A NAME="771"></A><BR><BR>That again is inevitable.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>Then things which are in time, and partake of time, must in every case, 
<A NAME="773"></A>I suppose, be of the same age with themselves; and must also become at 
<A NAME="774"></A>once older and younger than themselves?
<A NAME="775"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>But the one did not partake of those affections?
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Not at all.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>Then it does not partake of time, and is not in any 
<A NAME="779"></A>time?
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>So the argument shows.
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>Well, but do not the expressions "was," and "has become," and "was 
<A NAME="782"></A>becoming," signify a participation of past time?
<A NAME="783"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>And do not "will be," "will become," "will have become," signify a 
<A NAME="785"></A>participation of future time?
<A NAME="786"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>And "is," or "becomes," signifies a participation of present 
<A NAME="788"></A>time?
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>And if the one is absolutely without participation in time, it never 
<A NAME="791"></A>had become, or was becoming, or was at any time, or is now become or is 
<A NAME="792"></A>becoming, or is, or will become, or will have become, or will be, 
<A NAME="793"></A>hereafter.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR><BR>Most true.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>But are there any modes of partaking of being other than 
<A NAME="796"></A>these?
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>There are none.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>Then the one cannot possibly partake of being?
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>That is the inference.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>Then the one is not at all?
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>Clearly not.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Then the one does not exist in such way as to be one; for if it were 
<A NAME="803"></A>and partook of being, it would already be; but if the argument is to be 
<A NAME="804"></A>trusted, the one neither is nor is one?
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>But that which is not admits of no attribute or 
<A NAME="807"></A>relation?
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>Of course not.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>Then there is no name, nor expression, nor perception, nor opinion, 
<A NAME="810"></A>nor knowledge of it?
<A NAME="811"></A><BR><BR>Clearly not.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Then it is neither named, nor expressed, nor opined, nor known, nor 
<A NAME="813"></A>does anything that is perceive it.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR><BR>So we must infer.
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>But can all this be true about the one?
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>I think not.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR>Suppose, now, that we return once more to the original hypothesis; 
<A NAME="818"></A>let us see whether, on a further review, any new aspect of the question 
<A NAME="819"></A>appears.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR>I shall be very happy to do so.
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>We say that we have to work out together all the consequences, whatever 
<A NAME="822"></A>they may be, which follow, if the one is?
<A NAME="823"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Then we will begin at the beginning:-If one is, can one be, and not 
<A NAME="825"></A>partake of being?
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>Then the one will have being, but its being will not be the same with 
<A NAME="828"></A>the one; for if the same, it would not be the being of the one; nor would 
<A NAME="829"></A>the one have participated in being, for the proposition that one is would 
<A NAME="830"></A>have been identical with the proposition that one is one; but our hypothesis 
<A NAME="831"></A>is not if one is one, what will follow, but if one is:-am I not 
<A NAME="832"></A>right?
<A NAME="833"></A><BR><BR>Quite right.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>We mean to say, that being has not the same significance as 
<A NAME="835"></A>one?
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>And when we put them together shortly, and say "One is," that is equivalent 
<A NAME="838"></A>to saying, "partakes of being"?
<A NAME="839"></A><BR><BR>Quite true.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Once more then let us ask, if one is what will follow. Does not this 
<A NAME="841"></A>hypothesis necessarily imply that one is of such a nature as to have 
<A NAME="842"></A>parts?
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR>How so?
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>In this way:-If being is predicated of the one, if the one is, and 
<A NAME="845"></A>one of being, if being is one; and if being and one are not the same; and 
<A NAME="846"></A>since the one, which we have assumed, is, must not the whole, if it is 
<A NAME="847"></A>one, itself be, and have for its parts, one and being?
<A NAME="848"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>And is each of these parts-one and being to be simply called a part, 
<A NAME="850"></A>or must the word "part" be relative to the word "whole"?
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR>The latter.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>Then that which is one is both a whole and has a 
<A NAME="853"></A>part?
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>Again, of the parts of the one, if it is-I mean being and one-does 
<A NAME="856"></A>either fail to imply the other? is the one wanting to being, or being to 
<A NAME="857"></A>the one?
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>Thus, each of the parts also has in turn both one and being, and is 
<A NAME="860"></A>at the least made up of two parts; and the same principle goes on for ever, 
<A NAME="861"></A>and every part whatever has always these two parts; for being always involves 
<A NAME="862"></A>one, and one being; so that one is always disappearing, and becoming 
<A NAME="863"></A>two.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>And so the one, if it is, must be infinite in multiplicity?
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>Let us take another direction.
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>What direction?
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>We say that the one partakes of being and therefore it 
<A NAME="870"></A>is?
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>And in this way, the one, if it has being, has turned out to be 
<A NAME="873"></A>many?
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>But now, let us abstract the one which, as we say, partakes of being, 
<A NAME="876"></A>and try to imagine it apart from that of which, as we say, it partakes-will 
<A NAME="877"></A>this abstract one be one only or many?
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR>One, I think.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>Let us see:-Must not the being of one be other than one? for the one 
<A NAME="880"></A>is not being, but, considered as one, only partook of 
<A NAME="881"></A>being?
<A NAME="882"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>If being and the one be two different things, it is not because the 
<A NAME="884"></A>one is one that it is other than being; nor because being is being that 
<A NAME="885"></A>it is other than the one; but they differ from one another in virtue of 
<A NAME="886"></A>otherness and difference.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>So that the other is not the same either with the one or with 
<A NAME="889"></A>being?
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>And therefore whether we take being and the other, or being and the 
<A NAME="892"></A>one, or the one and the other, in every such case we take two things, which 
<A NAME="893"></A>may be rightly called both.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR><BR>How so.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>In this way-you may speak of being?
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>And also of one?
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>Then now we have spoken of either of them?
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>Well, and when I speak of being and one, I speak of them 
<A NAME="902"></A>both?
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>And if I speak of being and the other, or of the one and the other-in 
<A NAME="905"></A>any such case do I not speak of both?
<A NAME="906"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>And must not that which is correctly called both, be also 
<A NAME="908"></A>two?
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>Undoubtedly.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>And of two things how can either by any possibility not be 
<A NAME="911"></A>one?
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>It cannot.
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>Then, if the individuals of the pair are together two, they must be 
<A NAME="914"></A>severally one?
<A NAME="915"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>And if each of them is one, then by the addition of any one to any 
<A NAME="917"></A>pair, the whole becomes three?
<A NAME="918"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>And three are odd, and two are even?
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>And if there are two there must also be twice, and if there are three 
<A NAME="922"></A>there must be thrice; that is, if twice one makes two, and thrice one 
<A NAME="923"></A>three?
<A NAME="924"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>There are two, and twice, and therefore there must be twice two; and 
<A NAME="926"></A>there are three, and there is thrice, and therefore there must be thrice 
<A NAME="927"></A>three?
<A NAME="928"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>If there are three and twice, there is twice three; and if there are 
<A NAME="930"></A>two and thrice, there is thrice two?
<A NAME="931"></A><BR><BR>Undoubtedly.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>Here, then, we have even taken even times, and odd taken odd times, 
<A NAME="933"></A>and even taken odd times, and odd taken even times.
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>And if this is so, does any number remain which has no necessity to 
<A NAME="936"></A>be?
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR>None whatever.
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>Then if one is, number must also be?
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>It must.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>But if there is number, there must also be many, and infinite multiplicity 
<A NAME="941"></A>of being; for number is infinite in multiplicity, and partakes also of 
<A NAME="942"></A>being: am I not right?
<A NAME="943"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>And if all number participates in being, every part of number will 
<A NAME="945"></A>also participate?
<A NAME="946"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>Then being is distributed over the whole multitude of things, and nothing 
<A NAME="948"></A>that is, however small or however great, is devoid of it? And, indeed, 
<A NAME="949"></A>the very supposition of this is absurd, for how can that which is, be devoid 
<A NAME="950"></A>of being?
<A NAME="951"></A><BR><BR>In no way.
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>And it is divided into the greatest and into the smallest, and into 
<A NAME="953"></A>being of all sizes, and is broken up more than all things; the divisions 
<A NAME="954"></A>of it have no limit.
<A NAME="955"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>Then it has the greatest number of parts?
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>Yes, the greatest number.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>Is there any of these which is a part of being, and yet no 
<A NAME="959"></A>part?
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>But if it is at all and so long as it is, it must be one, and cannot 
<A NAME="962"></A>be none?
<A NAME="963"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>Then the one attaches to every single part of being, and does not fail 
<A NAME="965"></A>in any part, whether great or small, or whatever may be the size of 
<A NAME="966"></A>it?
<A NAME="967"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>But reflect:-an one in its entirety, be in many places at the same 
<A NAME="969"></A>time?
<A NAME="970"></A><BR><BR>No; I see the impossibility of that.
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>And if not in its entirety, then it is divided; for it cannot be present 
<A NAME="972"></A>with all the parts of being, unless divided.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>And that which has parts will be as many as the parts 
<A NAME="975"></A>are?
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>Then we were wrong in saying just now, that being was distributed into 
<A NAME="978"></A>the greatest number of parts. For it is not distributed into parts more 
<A NAME="979"></A>than the one, into parts equal to the one; the one is never wanting to 
<A NAME="980"></A>being, or being to the one, but being two they are co-equal and 
<A NAME="981"></A>coextensive.
<A NAME="982"></A><BR><BR>Certainly that is true.
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>The one itself, then, having been broken up into parts by being, is 
<A NAME="984"></A>many and infinite?
<A NAME="985"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>Then not only the one which has being is many, but the one itself distributed 
<A NAME="987"></A>by being, must also be many?
<A NAME="988"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>Further, inasmuch as the parts are parts of a whole, the one, as a 
<A NAME="990"></A>whole, will be limited; for are not the parts contained the 
<A NAME="991"></A>whole?
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>And that which contains, is a limit?
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>Then the one if it has being is one and many, whole and parts, having 
<A NAME="996"></A>limits and yet unlimited in number?
<A NAME="997"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>And because having limits, also having extremes?
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>And if a whole, having beginning and middle and end. For can anything 
<A NAME="1001"></A>be a whole without these three? And if any one of them is wanting to anything, 
<A NAME="1002"></A>will that any longer be a whole?
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR><BR>No.
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>Then the one, as appears, will have beginning, middle, and 
<A NAME="1005"></A>end.
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>It will.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>But, again, the middle will be equidistant from the extremes; or it 
<A NAME="1008"></A>would not be in the middle?
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>Then the one will partake of figure, either rectilinear or round, or 
<A NAME="1011"></A>a union of the two?
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>And if this is the case, it will be both in itself and in another 
<A NAME="1014"></A>too.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR><BR>How?
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>Every part is in the whole, and none is outside the 
<A NAME="1017"></A>whole.
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>And all the parts are contained by the whole?
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>And the one is all its parts, and neither more nor less than 
<A NAME="1022"></A>all?
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>No.
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>And the one is the whole?
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>But if all the parts are in the whole, and the one is all of them and 
<A NAME="1027"></A>the whole, and they are all contained by the whole, the one will be contained 
<A NAME="1028"></A>by the one; and thus the one will be in itself.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>But then, again, the whole is not in the parts-neither in all the parts, 
<A NAME="1031"></A>nor in some one of them. For if it is in all, it must be in one; for if 
<A NAME="1032"></A>there were any one in which it was not, it could not be in all the parts; 
<A NAME="1033"></A>for the part in which it is wanting is one of all, and if the whole is 
<A NAME="1034"></A>not in this, how can it be in them all?
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR><BR>It cannot.
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>Nor can the whole be in some of the parts; for if the whole were in 
<A NAME="1037"></A>some of the parts, the greater would be in the less, which is 
<A NAME="1038"></A>impossible.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR><BR>Yes, impossible.
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>But if the whole is neither in one, nor in more than one, nor in all 
<A NAME="1041"></A>of the parts, it must be in something else, or cease to be anywhere at 
<A NAME="1042"></A>all?
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>If it were nowhere, it would be nothing; but being a whole, and not 
<A NAME="1045"></A>being in itself, it must be in another.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>The one then, regarded as a whole, is in another, but regarded as being 
<A NAME="1048"></A>all its parts, is in itself; and therefore the one must be itself in itself 
<A NAME="1049"></A>and also in another.
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>The one then, being of this nature, is of necessity both at rest and 
<A NAME="1052"></A>in motion?
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR><BR>How?
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>The one is at rest since it is in itself, for being in one, and not 
<A NAME="1055"></A>passing out of this, it is in the same, which is itself.
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>And that which is ever in the same, must be ever at 
<A NAME="1058"></A>rest?
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>Well, and must not that, on the contrary, which is ever in other, never 
<A NAME="1061"></A>be in the same; and if never in the same, never at rest, and if not at 
<A NAME="1062"></A>rest, in motion?
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>Then the one being always itself in itself and other, must always be 
<A NAME="1065"></A>both at rest and in motion?
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>And must be the same with itself, and other than itself; and also the 
<A NAME="1068"></A>same with the others, and other than the others; this follows from its 
<A NAME="1069"></A>previous affections.
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR><BR>How so?
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>Every thing in relation to every other thing, is either the same or 
<A NAME="1072"></A>other; or if neither the same nor other, then in the relation of a part 
<A NAME="1073"></A>to a whole, or of a whole to a part.
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>And is the one a part of itself?
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>Since it is not a part in relation to itself it cannot be related to 
<A NAME="1078"></A>itself as whole to part?
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR><BR>It cannot.
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>But is the one other than one?
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>No.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>And therefore not other than itself?
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>If then it be neither other, nor a whole, nor a part in relation to 
<A NAME="1085"></A>itself, must it not be the same with itself?
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>But then, again, a thing which is in another place from "itself," if 
<A NAME="1088"></A>this "itself" remains in the same place with itself, must be other than 
<A NAME="1089"></A>"itself," for it will be in another place?
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>Then the one has been shown to be at once in itself and in 
<A NAME="1092"></A>another?
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>Thus, then, as appears, the one will be other than 
<A NAME="1095"></A>itself?
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>Well, then, if anything be other than anything, will it not be other 
<A NAME="1098"></A>than that which is other?
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>And will not all things that are not one, be other than the one, and 
<A NAME="1101"></A>the one other than the not-one?
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>Then the one will be other than the others?
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>But, consider:-Are not the absolute same, and the absolute other, opposites 
<A NAME="1106"></A>to one another?
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>Then will the same ever be in the other, or the other in the 
<A NAME="1109"></A>same?
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>They will not.
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>If then the other is never in the same, there is nothing in which the 
<A NAME="1112"></A>other is during any space of time; for during that space of time, however 
<A NAME="1113"></A>small, the other would be in the game. Is not that true?
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR><BR>Yes. And since the other-is never in the same, it can never be 
<A NAME="1115"></A>in anything that is.
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>Then the other will never be either in the not one, or in the 
<A NAME="1118"></A>one?
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>Then not by reason of otherness is the one other than the not-one, 
<A NAME="1121"></A>or the not-one other than the one.
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR><BR>No.
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>Nor by reason of themselves will they be other than one another, if 
<A NAME="1124"></A>not partaking of the other.
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR><BR>How can they be?
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>But if they are not other, either by reason of themselves or of the 
<A NAME="1127"></A>other, will they not altogether escape being other than one 
<A NAME="1128"></A>another?
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR><BR>They will.
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>Again, the not-one cannot partake of the one; otherwise it would not 
<A NAME="1131"></A>have been not-one, but would have been in some way one.
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>Nor can the not-one be number; for having number, it would not have 
<A NAME="1134"></A>been not-one at all.
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR><BR>It would not.
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>Again, is the not-one part of the one; or rather, would it not in that 
<A NAME="1137"></A>case partake of the one?
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR><BR>It would.
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>If then, in every point of view, the one and the not-one are distinct, 
<A NAME="1140"></A>then neither is the one part or whole of the not-one, nor is the not-one 
<A NAME="1141"></A>part or whole of the one?
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR><BR>No.
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>But we said that things which are neither parts nor wholes of one another, 
<A NAME="1144"></A>nor other than one another, will be the same with one another: -so we 
<A NAME="1145"></A>said?
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>Then shall we say that the one, being in this relation to the not-one, 
<A NAME="1148"></A>is the same with it?
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR><BR>Let us say so.
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR>Then it is the same with itself and the others, and also other than 
<A NAME="1151"></A>itself and the others.
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR><BR>That appears to be the inference. And it will also be like and 
<A NAME="1153"></A>unlike itself and the others?
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps.
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>Since the one was shown to be other than the others, the others will 
<A NAME="1156"></A>also be other than the one.
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR>And the one is other than the others in the same degree that the others 
<A NAME="1159"></A>are other than it, and neither more nor less?
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR>And if neither more nor less, then in a like degree?
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR>In virtue of the affection by which the one is other than others and 
<A NAME="1164"></A>others in like manner other than it, the one will be affected like the 
<A NAME="1165"></A>others and the others like the one.
<A NAME="1166"></A><BR><BR>How do you mean?
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR>I may take as an illustration the case of names: You give a name to 
<A NAME="1168"></A>a thing?
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR>And you may say the name once or oftener?
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1172"></A><BR>And when you say it once, you mention that of which it is the name? 
<A NAME="1173"></A>and when more than once, is it something else which you mention? or must 
<A NAME="1174"></A>it always be the same thing of which you speak, whether you utter the name 
<A NAME="1175"></A>once or more than once?
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR><BR>Of course it is the same.
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR>And is not "other" a name given to a thing?
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR>Whenever, then, you use the word "other," whether once or oftener, 
<A NAME="1180"></A>you name that of which it is the name, and to no other do you give the 
<A NAME="1181"></A>name?
<A NAME="1182"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR>Then when we say that the others are other than the one, and the one 
<A NAME="1184"></A>other than the others, in repeating the word "other" we speak of that nature 
<A NAME="1185"></A>to which the name is applied, and of no other?
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR><BR>Quite true.
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR>Then the one which is other than others, and the other which is other 
<A NAME="1188"></A>than the one, in that the word "other" is applied to both, will be in the 
<A NAME="1189"></A>same condition; and that which is in the same condition is 
<A NAME="1190"></A>like?
<A NAME="1191"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR>Then in virtue of the affection by which the one is other than the 
<A NAME="1193"></A>others, every thing will be like every thing, for every thing is other 
<A NAME="1194"></A>than every thing.
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR>Again, the like is opposed to the unlike?
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR>And the other to the same?
<A NAME="1199"></A><BR>True again.
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR>And the one was also shown to be the same with the 
<A NAME="1201"></A>others?
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1203"></A><BR>And to be, the same with the others is the opposite of being other 
<A NAME="1204"></A>than the others?
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1206"></A><BR>And in that it was other it was shown to be like?
<A NAME="1207"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1208"></A><BR>But in that it was the same it will be unlike by virtue of the opposite 
<A NAME="1209"></A>affection to that which made it and this was the affection of 
<A NAME="1210"></A>otherness.
<A NAME="1211"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1212"></A><BR>The same then will make it unlike; otherwise it will not be the opposite 
<A NAME="1213"></A>of the other.
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1215"></A><BR>Then the one will be both like and unlike the others; like in so far 
<A NAME="1216"></A>as it is other, and unlike in so far as it is the same.
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that argument may be used.
<A NAME="1218"></A><BR>And there is another argument.
<A NAME="1219"></A><BR>What?
<A NAME="1220"></A><BR>In so far as it is affected in the same way it is not affected otherwise, 
<A NAME="1221"></A>and not being affected otherwise is not unlike, and not being unlike, is 
<A NAME="1222"></A>like; but in so far as it is affected by other it is otherwise, and being 
<A NAME="1223"></A>otherwise affected is unlike.
<A NAME="1224"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1225"></A><BR>Then because the one is the same with the others and other than the 
<A NAME="1226"></A>others, on either of these two grounds, or on both of them, it will be 
<A NAME="1227"></A>both like and unlike the others?
<A NAME="1228"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1229"></A><BR>And in the same way as being other than itself, and the same with itself 
<A NAME="1230"></A>on either of these two grounds and on both of them, it will be like and 
<A NAME="1231"></A>unlike itself.
<A NAME="1232"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="1233"></A><BR>Again, how far can the one touch or not touch itself and 
<A NAME="1234"></A>others?-Consider.
<A NAME="1235"></A><BR><BR>I am considering.
<A NAME="1236"></A><BR>The one was shown to be in itself which was a whole?
<A NAME="1237"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="1238"></A><BR>And also in other things?
<A NAME="1239"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1240"></A><BR>In so far as it is in other things it would touch other things, but 
<A NAME="1241"></A>in so far as it is in itself it would be debarred from touching them, and 
<A NAME="1242"></A>would touch itself only.
<A NAME="1243"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="1244"></A><BR>Then the inference is that it would touch both?
<A NAME="1245"></A><BR>It would.
<A NAME="1246"></A><BR>But what do you say to a new point of view? Must not that which is 
<A NAME="1247"></A>to touch another be next to that which it is to touch, and occupy the place 
<A NAME="1248"></A>nearest to that in which what it touches is situated?
<A NAME="1249"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1250"></A><BR>Then the one, if it is to touch itself, ought to be situated next to 
<A NAME="1251"></A>itself, and occupy the place next to that in which itself 
<A NAME="1252"></A>is?
<A NAME="1253"></A><BR><BR>It ought.
<A NAME="1254"></A><BR>And that would require that the one should be two, and be in two places 
<A NAME="1255"></A>at once, and this, while it is one, will never happen.
<A NAME="1256"></A><BR><BR>No.
<A NAME="1257"></A><BR>Then the one cannot touch itself any more than it can be 
<A NAME="1258"></A>two?
<A NAME="1259"></A><BR>It cannot.
<A NAME="1260"></A><BR>Neither can it touch others.
<A NAME="1261"></A><BR>Why not?
<A NAME="1262"></A><BR>The reason is, that whatever is to touch another must be in separation 
<A NAME="1263"></A>from, and next to, that which it is to touch, and no third thing can be 
<A NAME="1264"></A>between them.
<A NAME="1265"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1266"></A><BR>Two things, then, at the least ate necessary to make contact 
<A NAME="1267"></A>possible?
<A NAME="1268"></A><BR><BR>They are.
<A NAME="1269"></A><BR>And if to the two a third be added in due order, the number of terms 
<A NAME="1270"></A>will be three, and the contacts two?
<A NAME="1271"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1272"></A><BR>And every additional term makes one additional contact, whence it follows 
<A NAME="1273"></A>that the contacts are one less in number than the terms; the first two 
<A NAME="1274"></A>terms exceeded the number of contacts by one, and the whole number of terms 
<A NAME="1275"></A>exceeds the whole number of contacts by one in like manner; and for every 
<A NAME="1276"></A>one which is afterwards added to the number of terms, one contact is added 
<A NAME="1277"></A>to the contacts.
<A NAME="1278"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1279"></A><BR>Whatever is the whole number of things, the contacts will be always 
<A NAME="1280"></A>one less.
<A NAME="1281"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1282"></A><BR>But if there be only one, and not two, there will be no 
<A NAME="1283"></A>contact?
<A NAME="1284"></A><BR>How can there be?
<A NAME="1285"></A><BR>And do we not say that the others being other than the one are not 
<A NAME="1286"></A>one and have no part in the one?
<A NAME="1287"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1288"></A><BR>Then they have no number, if they have no one in 
<A NAME="1289"></A>them?
<A NAME="1290"></A><BR>Of course not.
<A NAME="1291"></A><BR>Then the others are neither one nor two, nor are they called by the 
<A NAME="1292"></A>name of any number?
<A NAME="1293"></A><BR><BR>No.
<A NAME="1294"></A><BR>One, then, alone is one, and two do not exist?
<A NAME="1295"></A><BR>Clearly not.
<A NAME="1296"></A><BR>And if there are not two, there is no contact?
<A NAME="1297"></A><BR>There is not.
<A NAME="1298"></A><BR>Then neither does the one touch the others, nor the others the one, 
<A NAME="1299"></A>if there is no contact?
<A NAME="1300"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="1301"></A><BR>For all which reasons the one touches and does not touch itself and 
<A NAME="1302"></A>the others?
<A NAME="1303"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1304"></A><BR>Further-is the one equal and unequal to itself and 
<A NAME="1305"></A>others?
<A NAME="1306"></A><BR>How do you mean?
<A NAME="1307"></A><BR>If the one were greater or less than the others, or the others greater 
<A NAME="1308"></A>or less than the one, they would not be greater or less than each other 
<A NAME="1309"></A>in virtue of their being the one and the others; but, if in addition to 
<A NAME="1310"></A>their being what they are they had equality, they would be equal to one 
<A NAME="1311"></A>another, or if the one had smallness and the others greatness, or the one 
<A NAME="1312"></A>had greatness and the others smallness-whichever kind had greatness would 
<A NAME="1313"></A>be greater, and whichever had smallness would be smaller?
<A NAME="1314"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1315"></A><BR>Then there are two such ideas as greatness and smallness; for if they 
<A NAME="1316"></A>were not they could not be opposed to each other and be present in that 
<A NAME="1317"></A>which is.
<A NAME="1318"></A><BR><BR>How could they?
<A NAME="1319"></A><BR>If, then, smallness is present in the one it will be present either 
<A NAME="1320"></A>in the whole or in a part of the whole?
<A NAME="1321"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1322"></A><BR>Suppose the first; it will be either co-equal and co-extensive with 
<A NAME="1323"></A>the whole one, or will contain the one?
<A NAME="1324"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="1325"></A><BR>If it be co-extensive with the one it will be coequal with the one, 
<A NAME="1326"></A>or if containing the one it will be greater than the 
<A NAME="1327"></A>one?
<A NAME="1328"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="1329"></A><BR>But can smallness be equal to anything or greater than anything, and 
<A NAME="1330"></A>have the functions of greatness and equality and not its own 
<A NAME="1331"></A>functions?
<A NAME="1332"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="1333"></A><BR>Then smallness cannot be in the whole of one, but, if at all, in a 
<A NAME="1334"></A>part only?
<A NAME="1335"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1336"></A><BR>And surely not in all of a part, for then the difficulty of the whole 
<A NAME="1337"></A>will recur; it will be equal to or greater than any part in which it 
<A NAME="1338"></A>is.
<A NAME="1339"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1340"></A><BR>Then smallness will not be in anything, whether in a whole or in a 
<A NAME="1341"></A>part; nor will there be anything small but actual smallness.
<A NAME="1342"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1343"></A><BR>Neither will greatness be in the one, for if greatness be in anything 
<A NAME="1344"></A>there will be something greater other and besides greatness itself, namely, 
<A NAME="1345"></A>that in which greatness is; and this too when the small itself is not there, 
<A NAME="1346"></A>which the one, if it is great, must exceed; this, however, is impossible, 
<A NAME="1347"></A>seeing that smallness is wholly absent.
<A NAME="1348"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1349"></A><BR>But absolute greatness is only greater than absolute smallness, and 
<A NAME="1350"></A>smallness is only smaller than absolute greatness.
<A NAME="1351"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="1352"></A><BR>Then other things not greater or less than the one, if they have neither 
<A NAME="1353"></A>greatness nor smallness; nor have greatness or smallness any power of exceeding 
<A NAME="1354"></A>or being exceeded in relation to the one, but only in relation to one another; 
<A NAME="1355"></A>nor will the one be greater or less than them or others, if it has neither 
<A NAME="1356"></A>greatness nor smallness.
<A NAME="1357"></A><BR><BR>Clearly not.
<A NAME="1358"></A><BR>Then if the one is neither greater nor less than the others, it cannot 
<A NAME="1359"></A>either exceed or be exceeded by them?
<A NAME="1360"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="1361"></A><BR>And that which neither exceeds nor is exceeded, must be on an equality; 
<A NAME="1362"></A>and being on an equality, must be equal.
<A NAME="1363"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="1364"></A><BR>And this will be true also of the relation of the one to itself; having 
<A NAME="1365"></A>neither greatness nor smallness in itself, it will neither exceed nor be 
<A NAME="1366"></A>exceeded by itself, but will be on an equality with and equal to 
<A NAME="1367"></A>itself.
<A NAME="1368"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1369"></A><BR>Then the one will be equal to both itself and the 
<A NAME="1370"></A>others?
<A NAME="1371"></A><BR>Clearly so.
<A NAME="1372"></A><BR>And yet the one, being itself in itself, will also surround and be 
<A NAME="1373"></A>without itself; and, as containing itself, will be greater than itself; 
<A NAME="1374"></A>and, as contained in itself, will be less; and will thus be greater and 
<A NAME="1375"></A>less than itself.
<A NAME="1376"></A><BR><BR>It will.
<A NAME="1377"></A><BR>Now there cannot possibly be anything which is not included in the 
<A NAME="1378"></A>one and the others?
<A NAME="1379"></A><BR><BR>Of course not.
<A NAME="1380"></A><BR>But, surely, that which is must always be somewhere?
<A NAME="1381"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1382"></A><BR>But that which is in anything will be less, and that in which it is 
<A NAME="1383"></A>will be greater; in no other way can one thing be in 
<A NAME="1384"></A>another.
<A NAME="1385"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1386"></A><BR>And since there is nothing other or besides the one and the others, 
<A NAME="1387"></A>and they must be in something, must they not be in one another, the one 
<A NAME="1388"></A>in the others and the others in the one, if they are to be 
<A NAME="1389"></A>anywhere?
<A NAME="1390"></A><BR><BR>That is clear.
<A NAME="1391"></A><BR>But inasmuch as the one is in the others, the others will be greater 
<A NAME="1392"></A>than the one, because they contain the one, which will be less than the 
<A NAME="1393"></A>others, because it is contained in them; and inasmuch as the others are 
<A NAME="1394"></A>in the one, the one on the same principle will be greater than the others, 
<A NAME="1395"></A>and the others less than the one.
<A NAME="1396"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1397"></A><BR>The one, then, will be equal to and greater and less than itself and 
<A NAME="1398"></A>the others?
<A NAME="1399"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="1400"></A><BR>And if it be greater and less and equal, it will be of equal and more 
<A NAME="1401"></A>and less measures or divisions than itself and the others, and if of measures, 
<A NAME="1402"></A>also of parts?
<A NAME="1403"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="1404"></A><BR>And if of equal and more and less measures or divisions, it will be 
<A NAME="1405"></A>in number more or less than itself and the others, and likewise equal in 
<A NAME="1406"></A>number to itself and to the others?
<A NAME="1407"></A><BR><BR>How is that?
<A NAME="1408"></A><BR>It will be of more measures than those things which it exceeds, and 
<A NAME="1409"></A>of as many parts as measures; and so with that to which it is equal, and 
<A NAME="1410"></A>that than which it is less.
<A NAME="1411"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1412"></A><BR>And being greater and less than itself, and equal to itself, it will 
<A NAME="1413"></A>be of equal measures with itself and of more and fewer measures than itself; 
<A NAME="1414"></A>and if of measures then also of parts?
<A NAME="1415"></A><BR><BR>It will.
<A NAME="1416"></A><BR>And being of equal parts with itself, it will be numerically equal 
<A NAME="1417"></A>to itself; and being of more parts, more, and being of less, less than 
<A NAME="1418"></A>itself?
<A NAME="1419"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1420"></A><BR>And the same will hold of its relation to other things; inasmuch as 
<A NAME="1421"></A>it is greater than them, it will be more in number than them; and inasmuch 
<A NAME="1422"></A>as it is smaller, it will be less in number; and inasmuch as it is equal 
<A NAME="1423"></A>in size to other things, it will be equal to them in 
<A NAME="1424"></A>number.
<A NAME="1425"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1426"></A><BR>Once more then, as would appear, the one will be in number both equal 
<A NAME="1427"></A>to and more and less than both itself and all other 
<A NAME="1428"></A>things.
<A NAME="1429"></A><BR><BR>It will.
<A NAME="1430"></A><BR><BR>Does the one also partake of time? And is it and does it become 
<A NAME="1431"></A>older and younger than itself and others, and again, neither younger nor 
<A NAME="1432"></A>older than itself and others, by virtue of participation in 
<A NAME="1433"></A>time?
<A NAME="1434"></A><BR><BR>How do you mean?
<A NAME="1435"></A><BR>If one is, being must be predicated of it?
<A NAME="1436"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1437"></A><BR>But to be (einai) is only participation of being in present time, and 
<A NAME="1438"></A>to have been is the participation of being at a past time, and to be about 
<A NAME="1439"></A>to be is the participation of being at a future time?
<A NAME="1440"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="1441"></A><BR>Then the one, since it partakes of being, partakes of 
<A NAME="1442"></A>time?
<A NAME="1443"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1444"></A><BR>And is not time always moving forward?
<A NAME="1445"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1446"></A><BR>Then the one is always becoming older than itself, since it moves forward 
<A NAME="1447"></A>in time?
<A NAME="1448"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1449"></A><BR>And do you remember that the older becomes older than that which becomes 
<A NAME="1450"></A>younger?
<A NAME="1451"></A><BR><BR>I remember.
<A NAME="1452"></A><BR>Then since the one becomes older than itself, it becomes younger at 
<A NAME="1453"></A>the same time?
<A NAME="1454"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1455"></A><BR>Thus, then, the one becomes older as well as younger than 
<A NAME="1456"></A>itself?
<A NAME="1457"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1458"></A><BR>And it is older (is it not?) when in becoming, it gets to the point 
<A NAME="1459"></A>of time. between "was" and "will be," which is "now": for surely in going 
<A NAME="1460"></A>from the past to the future, it cannot skip the present?
<A NAME="1461"></A><BR><BR>No.
<A NAME="1462"></A><BR>And when it arrives at the present it stops from becoming older, and 
<A NAME="1463"></A>no longer becomes, but is older, for if it went on it would never be reached 
<A NAME="1464"></A>by the present, for it is the nature of that which goes on, to touch both 
<A NAME="1465"></A>the present and the future, letting go the present and seizing the future, 
<A NAME="1466"></A>while in process of becoming between them.
<A NAME="1467"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1468"></A><BR>But that which is becoming cannot skip the present; when it reaches 
<A NAME="1469"></A>the present it ceases to become, and is then whatever it may happen to 
<A NAME="1470"></A>be becoming.
<A NAME="1471"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="1472"></A><BR>And so the one, when in becoming older it reaches the present, ceases 
<A NAME="1473"></A>to become, and is then older.
<A NAME="1474"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1475"></A><BR>And it is older than that than which it was becoming older, and it 
<A NAME="1476"></A>was becoming older than itself.
<A NAME="1477"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1478"></A><BR>And that which is older is older than that which is 
<A NAME="1479"></A>younger?
<A NAME="1480"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="1481"></A><BR>Then the one is younger than itself, when in becoming older it reaches 
<A NAME="1482"></A>the present?
<A NAME="1483"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1484"></A><BR>But the present is always present with the one during all its being; 
<A NAME="1485"></A>for whenever it is it is always now.
<A NAME="1486"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1487"></A><BR>Then the one always both is and becomes older and younger than 
<A NAME="1488"></A>itself?
<A NAME="1489"></A><BR><BR>Truly.
<A NAME="1490"></A><BR>And is it or does it become a longer time than itself or an equal time 
<A NAME="1491"></A>with itself?
<A NAME="1492"></A><BR><BR>An equal time.
<A NAME="1493"></A><BR>But if it becomes or is for an equal time with itself, it is of the 
<A NAME="1494"></A>same age with itself?
<A NAME="1495"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="1496"></A><BR>And that which is of the same age, is neither older nor 
<A NAME="1497"></A>younger?
<A NAME="1498"></A><BR>No.
<A NAME="1499"></A><BR>The one, then, becoming and being the same time with itself, neither 
<A NAME="1500"></A>is nor becomes older or younger than itself?
<A NAME="1501"></A><BR><BR>I should say not.
<A NAME="1502"></A><BR>And what are its relations to other things? Is it or does it become 
<A NAME="1503"></A>older or younger than they?
<A NAME="1504"></A><BR><BR>I cannot tell you.
