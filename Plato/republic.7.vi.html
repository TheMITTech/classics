<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Socrates - GLAUCON
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>And thus, Glaucon, after the argument has gone a weary way, the 
<A NAME="12"></A>true and the false philosophers have at length appeared in 
<A NAME="13"></A>view.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>I do not think, he said, that the way could have been 
<A NAME="15"></A>shortened.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>I suppose not, I said; and yet I believe that we might have had a better 
<A NAME="17"></A>view of both of them if the discussion could have been confined to this 
<A NAME="18"></A>one subject and if there were not many other questions awaiting us, which 
<A NAME="19"></A>he who desires to see in what respect the life of the just differs from 
<A NAME="20"></A>that of the unjust must consider.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>And what is the next question? he asked.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Surely, I said, the one which follows next in order. Inasmuch as philosophers 
<A NAME="23"></A>only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable, and those who wander 
<A NAME="24"></A>in the region of the many and variable are not philosophers, I must ask 
<A NAME="25"></A>you which of the two classes should be the rulers of our 
<A NAME="26"></A>State?
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>And how can we rightly answer that question?
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Whichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and institutions 
<A NAME="29"></A>of our State --let them be our guardians.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Very good.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Neither, I said, can there be any question that the guardian who is 
<A NAME="32"></A>to keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>There can be no question of that.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>And are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge 
<A NAME="35"></A>of the true being of each thing, and who have in their souls no clear pattern, 
<A NAME="36"></A>and are unable as with a painter's eye to look at the absolute truth and 
<A NAME="37"></A>to that original to repair, and having perfect vision of the other world 
<A NAME="38"></A>to order the laws about beauty, goodness, justice in this, if not already 
<A NAME="39"></A>ordered, and to guard and preserve the order of them --are not such persons, 
<A NAME="40"></A>I ask, simply blind?
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>Truly, he replied, they are much in that condition.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>And shall they be our guardians when there are others who, besides 
<A NAME="43"></A>being their equals in experience and falling short of them in no particular 
<A NAME="44"></A>of virtue, also know the very truth of each thing?
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>There can be no reason, he said, for rejecting those who have this 
<A NAME="46"></A>greatest of all great qualities; they must always have the first place 
<A NAME="47"></A>unless they fail in some other respect.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>Suppose then, I said, that we determine how far they can unite 
<A NAME="49"></A>this and the other excellences.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>By all means.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>In the first place, as we began by observing, the nature of the philosopher 
<A NAME="52"></A>has to be ascertained. We must come to an understanding about him, and, 
<A NAME="53"></A>when we have done so, then, if I am not mistaken, we shall also acknowledge 
<A NAME="54"></A>that such an union of qualities is possible, and that those in whom they 
<A NAME="55"></A>are united, and those only, should be rulers in the 
<A NAME="56"></A>State.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean?
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Let us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a 
<A NAME="59"></A>sort which shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation and 
<A NAME="60"></A>corruption.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>Agreed.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>And further, I said, let us agree that they are lovers of all true 
<A NAME="63"></A>being; there is no part whether greater or less, or more or less honourable, 
<A NAME="64"></A>which they are willing to renounce; as we said before of the lover and 
<A NAME="65"></A>the man of ambition.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>And if they are to be what we were describing, is there not another 
<A NAME="68"></A>quality which they should also possess?
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>What quality?
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>Truthfulness: they will never intentionally receive into their mind 
<A NAME="71"></A>falsehood, which is their detestation, and they will love the 
<A NAME="72"></A>truth.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that may be safely affirmed of them.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>'May be,' my friend, I replied, is not the word; say rather 'must be 
<A NAME="75"></A>affirmed:' for he whose nature is amorous of anything cannot help loving 
<A NAME="76"></A>all that belongs or is akin to the object of his affections.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>Right, he said.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>And is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth?
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>How can there be?
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Can the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of 
<A NAME="81"></A>falsehood?
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Never.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>The true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth, as far 
<A NAME="84"></A>as in him lies, desire all truth?
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>Assuredly.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>But then again, as we know by experience, he whose desires are strong 
<A NAME="87"></A>in one direction will have them weaker in others; they will be like a stream 
<A NAME="88"></A>which has been drawn off into another channel.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>He whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be 
<A NAME="91"></A>absorbed in the pleasures of the soul, and will hardly feel bodily pleasure 
<A NAME="92"></A>--I mean, if he be a true philosopher and not a sham 
<A NAME="93"></A>one.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>That is most certain.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Such an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous; for 
<A NAME="96"></A>the motives which make another man desirous of having and spending, have 
<A NAME="97"></A>no place in his character.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>Another criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be 
<A NAME="100"></A>considered.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>What is that?
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>There should be no secret corner of illiberality; nothing can more 
<A NAME="103"></A>antagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the whole 
<A NAME="104"></A>of things both divine and human.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>Most true, he replied.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Then how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of 
<A NAME="107"></A>all time and all existence, think much of human life?
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>He cannot.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Or can such an one account death fearful?
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>No indeed.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true 
<A NAME="112"></A>philosophy?
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Or again: can he who is harmoniously constituted, who is not covetous 
<A NAME="115"></A>or mean, or a boaster, or a coward-can he, I say, ever be unjust or hard 
<A NAME="116"></A>in his dealings?
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Then you will soon observe whether a man is just and gentle, or rude 
<A NAME="119"></A>and unsociable; these are the signs which distinguish even in youth the 
<A NAME="120"></A>philosophical nature from the unphilosophical.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>There is another point which should be remarked.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>What point?
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Whether he has or has not a pleasure in learning; for no one will love 
<A NAME="125"></A>that which gives him pain, and in which after much toil he makes little 
<A NAME="126"></A>progress.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>And again, if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he learns, 
<A NAME="129"></A>will he not be an empty vessel?
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>That is certain.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Labouring in vain, he must end in hating himself and his fruitless 
<A NAME="132"></A>occupation? Yes.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>Then a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine philosophic 
<A NAME="134"></A>natures; we must insist that the philosopher should have a good 
<A NAME="135"></A>memory?
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>And once more, the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend to 
<A NAME="138"></A>disproportion?
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>Undoubtedly.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>And do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to 
<A NAME="141"></A>disproportion?
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>To proportion.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Then, besides other qualities, we must try to find a naturally well-proportioned 
<A NAME="144"></A>and gracious mind, which will move spontaneously towards the true being 
<A NAME="145"></A>of everything.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Well, and do not all these qualities, which we have been enumerating, 
<A NAME="148"></A>go together, and are they not, in a manner, necessary to a soul, which 
<A NAME="149"></A>is to have a full and perfect participation of being?
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>They are absolutely necessary, he replied.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>And must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who 
<A NAME="152"></A>has the gift of a good memory, and is quick to learn, --noble, gracious, 
<A NAME="153"></A>the friend of truth, justice, courage, temperance, who are his 
<A NAME="154"></A>kindred?
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>The god of jealousy himself, he said, could find no fault with 
<A NAME="156"></A>such a study.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>And to men like him, I said, when perfected by years and education, 
<A NAME="158"></A>and to these only you will entrust the State.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>Socrates - ADEIMANTUS
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>Here Adeimantus interposed and said: To these statements, Socrates, 
<A NAME="161"></A>no one can offer a reply; but when you talk in this way, a strange feeling 
<A NAME="162"></A>passes over the minds of your hearers: They fancy that they are led astray 
<A NAME="163"></A>a little at each step in the argument, owing to their own want of skill 
<A NAME="164"></A>in asking and answering questions; these littles accumulate, and at the 
<A NAME="165"></A>end of the discussion they are found to have sustained a mighty overthrow 
<A NAME="166"></A>and all their former notions appear to be turned upside down. And as unskilful 
<A NAME="167"></A>players of draughts are at last shut up by their more skilful adversaries 
<A NAME="168"></A>and have no piece to move, so they too find themselves shut up at last; 
<A NAME="169"></A>for they have nothing to say in this new game of which words are the counters; 
<A NAME="170"></A>and yet all the time they are in the right. The observation is suggested 
<A NAME="171"></A>to me by what is now occurring. For any one of us might say, that although 
<A NAME="172"></A>in words he is not able to meet you at each step of the argument, he sees 
<A NAME="173"></A>as a fact that the votaries of philosophy, when they carry on the study, 
<A NAME="174"></A>not only in youth as a part of education, but as the pursuit of their maturer 
<A NAME="175"></A>years, most of them become strange monsters, not to say utter rogues, and 
<A NAME="176"></A>that those who may be considered the best of them are made useless to the 
<A NAME="177"></A>world by the very study which you extol.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>Well, and do you think that those who say so are 
<A NAME="179"></A>wrong?
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>I cannot tell, he replied; but I should like to know what is your 
<A NAME="181"></A>opinion.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>Hear my answer; I am of opinion that they are quite 
<A NAME="183"></A>right.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>Then how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease 
<A NAME="185"></A>from evil until philosophers rule in them, when philosophers are acknowledged 
<A NAME="186"></A>by us to be of no use to them?
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>You ask a question, I said, to which a reply can only be given 
<A NAME="188"></A>in a parable.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>Yes, Socrates; and that is a way of speaking to which you are not 
<A NAME="190"></A>at all accustomed, I suppose.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>I perceive, I said, that you are vastly amused at having plunged 
<A NAME="192"></A>me into such a hopeless discussion; but now hear the parable, and then 
<A NAME="193"></A>you will be still more amused at the meagreness of my imagination: for 
<A NAME="194"></A>the manner in which the best men are treated in their own States is so 
<A NAME="195"></A>grievous that no single thing on earth is comparable to it; and therefore, 
<A NAME="196"></A>if I am to plead their cause, I must have recourse to fiction, and put 
<A NAME="197"></A>together a figure made up of many things, like the fabulous unions of goats 
<A NAME="198"></A>and stags which are found in pictures. Imagine then a fleet or a ship in 
<A NAME="199"></A>which there is a captain who is taller and stronger than any of the crew, 
<A NAME="200"></A>but he is a little deaf and has a similar infirmity in sight, and his knowledge 
<A NAME="201"></A>of navigation is not much better. The sailors are quarrelling with one 
<A NAME="202"></A>another about the steering --every one is of opinion that he has a right 
<A NAME="203"></A>to steer, though he has never learned the art of navigation and cannot 
<A NAME="204"></A>tell who taught him or when he learned, and will further assert that it 
<A NAME="205"></A>cannot be taught, and they are ready to cut in pieces any one who says 
<A NAME="206"></A>the contrary. They throng about the captain, begging and praying him to 
<A NAME="207"></A>commit the helm to them; and if at any time they do not prevail, but others 
<A NAME="208"></A>are preferred to them, they kill the others or throw them overboard, and 
<A NAME="209"></A>having first chained up the noble captain's senses with drink or some narcotic 
<A NAME="210"></A>drug, they mutiny and take possession of the ship and make free with the 
<A NAME="211"></A>stores; thus, eating and drinking, they proceed on their voyage in such 
<A NAME="212"></A>a manner as might be expected of them. Him who is their partisan and cleverly 
<A NAME="213"></A>aids them in their plot for getting the ship out of the captain's hands 
<A NAME="214"></A>into their own whether by force or persuasion, they compliment with the 
<A NAME="215"></A>name of sailor, pilot, able seaman, and abuse the other sort of man, whom 
<A NAME="216"></A>they call a good-for-nothing; but that the true pilot must pay attention 
<A NAME="217"></A>to the year and seasons and sky and stars and winds, and whatever else 
<A NAME="218"></A>belongs to his art, if he intends to be really qualified for the command 
<A NAME="219"></A>of a ship, and that he must and will be the steerer, whether other people 
<A NAME="220"></A>like or not-the possibility of this union of authority with the steerer's 
<A NAME="221"></A>art has never seriously entered into their thoughts or been made part of 
<A NAME="222"></A>their calling. Now in vessels which are in a state of mutiny and by sailors 
<A NAME="223"></A>who are mutineers, how will the true pilot be regarded? Will he not be 
<A NAME="224"></A>called by them a prater, a star-gazer, a good-for-nothing?
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>Of course, said Adeimantus.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Then you will hardly need, I said, to hear the interpretation of the 
<A NAME="227"></A>figure, which describes the true philosopher in his relation to the State; 
<A NAME="228"></A>for you understand already.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Then suppose you now take this parable to the gentleman who is surprised 
<A NAME="231"></A>at finding that philosophers have no honour in their cities; explain it 
<A NAME="232"></A>to him and try to convince him that their having honour would be far more 
<A NAME="233"></A>extraordinary.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>I will.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Say to him, that, in deeming the best votaries of philosophy to be 
<A NAME="236"></A>useless to the rest of the world, he is right; but also tell him to attribute 
<A NAME="237"></A>their uselessness to the fault of those who will not use them, and not 
<A NAME="238"></A>to themselves. The pilot should not humbly beg the sailors to be commanded 
<A NAME="239"></A>by him --that is not the order of nature; neither are 'the wise to go to 
<A NAME="240"></A>the doors of the rich' --the ingenious author of this saying told a lie 
<A NAME="241"></A>--but the truth is, that, when a man is ill, whether he be rich or poor, 
<A NAME="242"></A>to the physician he must go, and he who wants to be governed, to him who 
<A NAME="243"></A>is able to govern. The ruler who is good for anything ought not to beg 
<A NAME="244"></A>his subjects to be ruled by him; although the present governors of mankind 
<A NAME="245"></A>are of a different stamp; they may be justly compared to the mutinous sailors, 
<A NAME="246"></A>and the true helmsmen to those who are called by them good-for-nothings 
<A NAME="247"></A>and star-gazers.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>Precisely so, he said.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>For these reasons, and among men like these, philosophy, the noblest 
<A NAME="250"></A>pursuit of all, is not likely to be much esteemed by those of the opposite 
<A NAME="251"></A>faction; not that the greatest and most lasting injury is done to her by 
<A NAME="252"></A>her opponents, but by her own professing followers, the same of whom you 
<A NAME="253"></A>suppose the accuser to say, that the greater number of them are arrant 
<A NAME="254"></A>rogues, and the best are useless; in which opinion I 
<A NAME="255"></A>agreed.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>And the reason why the good are useless has now been 
<A NAME="258"></A>explained?
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>Then shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority is 
<A NAME="261"></A>also unavoidable, and that this is not to be laid to the charge of philosophy 
<A NAME="262"></A>any more than the other?
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>By all means.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>And let us ask and answer in turn, first going back to the description 
<A NAME="265"></A>of the gentle and noble nature. Truth, as you will remember, was his leader, 
<A NAME="266"></A>whom he followed always and in all things; failing in this, he was an impostor, 
<A NAME="267"></A>and had no part or lot in true philosophy.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that was said.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Well, and is not this one quality, to mention no others, greatly at 
<A NAME="270"></A>variance with present notions of him?
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>And have we not a right to say in his defence, that the true lover 
<A NAME="273"></A>of knowledge is always striving after being --that is his nature; he will 
<A NAME="274"></A>not rest in the multiplicity of individuals which is an appearance only, 
<A NAME="275"></A>but will go on --the keen edge will not be blunted, nor the force of his 
<A NAME="276"></A>desire abate until he have attained the knowledge of the true nature of 
<A NAME="277"></A>every essence by a sympathetic and kindred power in the soul, and by that 
<A NAME="278"></A>power drawing near and mingling and becoming incorporate with very being, 
<A NAME="279"></A>having begotten mind and truth, he will have knowledge and will live and 
<A NAME="280"></A>grow truly, and then, and not till then, will he cease from his 
<A NAME="281"></A>travail.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>Nothing, he said, can be more just than such a description of 
<A NAME="283"></A>him.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>And will the love of a lie be any part of a philosopher's nature? Will 
<A NAME="285"></A>he not utterly hate a lie?
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>He will.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>And when truth is the captain, we cannot suspect any evil of the band 
<A NAME="288"></A>which he leads?
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Justice and health of mind will be of the company, and temperance will 
<A NAME="291"></A>follow after?
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>True, he replied.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Neither is there any reason why I should again set in array the philosopher's 
<A NAME="294"></A>virtues, as you will doubtless remember that courage, magnificence, apprehension, 
<A NAME="295"></A>memory, were his natural gifts. And you objected that, although no one 
<A NAME="296"></A>could deny what I then said, still, if you leave words and look at facts, 
<A NAME="297"></A>the persons who are thus described are some of them manifestly useless, 
<A NAME="298"></A>and the greater number utterly depraved; we were then led to enquire into 
<A NAME="299"></A>the grounds of these accusations, and have now arrived at the point of 
<A NAME="300"></A>asking why are the majority bad, which question of necessity brought us 
<A NAME="301"></A>back to the examination and definition of the true philosopher.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>And we have next to consider the of the philosophic nature, why so 
<A NAME="304"></A>many are spoiled and so few escape spoiling --I am speaking of those who 
<A NAME="305"></A>were said to be useless but not wicked --and, when we have done with them, 
<A NAME="306"></A>we will speak of the imitators of philosophy, what manner of men are they 
<A NAME="307"></A>who aspire after a profession which is above them and of which they are 
<A NAME="308"></A>unworthy, and then, by their manifold inconsistencies, bring upon philosophy, 
<A NAME="309"></A>and upon all philosophers, that universal reprobation of which we 
<A NAME="310"></A>speak.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>What are these corruptions? he said.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>I will see if I can explain them to you. Every one will admit that 
<A NAME="313"></A>a nature having in perfection all the qualities which we required in a 
<A NAME="314"></A>philosopher, is a rare plant which is seldom seen among 
<A NAME="315"></A>men.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>Rare indeed.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>And what numberless and powerful causes tend to destroy these rare 
<A NAME="318"></A>natures!
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>What causes?
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>In the first place there are their own virtues, their courage, temperance, 
<A NAME="321"></A>and the rest of them, every one of which praise worthy qualities (and this 
<A NAME="322"></A>is a most singular circumstance) destroys and distracts from philosophy 
<A NAME="323"></A>the soul which is the possessor of them.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>That is very singular, he replied.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Then there are all the ordinary goods of life --beauty, wealth, strength, 
<A NAME="326"></A>rank, and great connections in the State --you understand the sort of things 
<A NAME="327"></A>--these also have a corrupting and distracting effect.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>I understand; but I should like to know more precisely what you 
<A NAME="329"></A>mean about them.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>Grasp the truth as a whole, I said, and in the right way; you will 
<A NAME="331"></A>then have no difficulty in apprehending the preceding remarks, and they 
<A NAME="332"></A>will no longer appear strange to you.
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>And how am I to do so? he asked.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Why, I said, we know that all germs or seeds, whether vegetable or 
<A NAME="335"></A>animal, when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climate or soil, 
<A NAME="336"></A>in proportion to their vigour, are all the more sensitive to the want of 
<A NAME="337"></A>a suitable environment, for evil is a greater enemy to what is good than 
<A NAME="338"></A>what is not.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>There is reason in supposing that the finest natures, when under alien 
<A NAME="341"></A>conditions, receive more injury than the inferior, because the contrast 
<A NAME="342"></A>is greater.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>And may we not say, Adeimantus, that the most gifted minds, when they 
<A NAME="345"></A>are ill-educated, become pre-eminently bad? Do not great crimes and the 
<A NAME="346"></A>spirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by education 
<A NAME="347"></A>rather than from any inferiority, whereas weak natures are scarcely capable 
<A NAME="348"></A>of any very great good or very great evil?
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>There I think that you are right.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>And our philosopher follows the same analogy-he is like a plant which, 
<A NAME="351"></A>having proper nurture, must necessarily grow and mature into all virtue, 
<A NAME="352"></A>but, if sown and planted in an alien soil, becomes the most noxious of 
<A NAME="353"></A>all weeds, unless he be preserved by some divine power. Do you really think, 
<A NAME="354"></A>as people so often say, that our youth are corrupted by Sophists, or that 
<A NAME="355"></A>private teachers of the art corrupt them in any degree worth speaking of? 
<A NAME="356"></A>Are not the public who say these things the greatest of all Sophists? And 
<A NAME="357"></A>do they not educate to perfection young and old, men and women alike, and 
<A NAME="358"></A>fashion them after their own hearts?
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>When is this accomplished? he said.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>When they meet together, and the world sits down at an assembly, or 
<A NAME="361"></A>in a court of law, or a theatre, or a camp, or in any other popular resort, 
<A NAME="362"></A>and there is a great uproar, and they praise some things which are being 
<A NAME="363"></A>said or done, and blame other things, equally exaggerating both, shouting 
<A NAME="364"></A>and clapping their hands, and the echo of the rocks and the place in which 
<A NAME="365"></A>they are assembled redoubles the sound of the praise or blame --at such 
<A NAME="366"></A>a time will not a young man's heart, as they say, leap within him? Will 
<A NAME="367"></A>any private training enable him to stand firm against the overwhelming 
<A NAME="368"></A>flood of popular opinion? or will he be carried away by the stream? Will 
<A NAME="369"></A>he not have the notions of good and evil which the public in general have 
<A NAME="370"></A>--he will do as they do, and as they are, such will he 
<A NAME="371"></A>be?
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>Yes, Socrates; necessity will compel him.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>And yet, I said, there is a still greater necessity, which has not 
<A NAME="374"></A>been mentioned.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>What is that?
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>The gentle force of attainder or confiscation or death which, as you 
<A NAME="377"></A>are aware, these new Sophists and educators who are the public, apply when 
<A NAME="378"></A>their words are powerless.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>Indeed they do; and in right good earnest.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Now what opinion of any other Sophist, or of any private person, can 
<A NAME="381"></A>be expected to overcome in such an unequal contest?
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>None, he replied.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>No, indeed, I said, even to make the attempt is a great piece of folly; 
<A NAME="384"></A>there neither is, nor has been, nor is ever likely to be, any different 
<A NAME="385"></A>type of character which has had no other training in virtue but that which 
<A NAME="386"></A>is supplied by public opinion --I speak, my friend, of human virtue only; 
<A NAME="387"></A>what is more than human, as the proverb says, is not included: for I would 
<A NAME="388"></A>not have you ignorant that, in the present evil state of governments, whatever 
<A NAME="389"></A>is saved and comes to good is saved by the power of God, as we may truly 
<A NAME="390"></A>say.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>I quite assent, he replied.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Then let me crave your assent also to a further 
<A NAME="393"></A>observation.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>What are you going to say?
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Why, that all those mercenary individuals, whom the many call Sophists 
<A NAME="396"></A>and whom they deem to be their adversaries, do, in fact, teach nothing 
<A NAME="397"></A>but the opinion of the many, that is to say, the opinions of their assemblies; 
<A NAME="398"></A>and this is their wisdom. I might compare them to a man who should study 
<A NAME="399"></A>the tempers and desires of a mighty strong beast who is fed by him-he would 
<A NAME="400"></A>learn how to approach and handle him, also at what times and from what 
<A NAME="401"></A>causes he is dangerous or the reverse, and what is the meaning of his several 
<A NAME="402"></A>cries, and by what sounds, when another utters them, he is soothed or infuriated; 
<A NAME="403"></A>and you may suppose further, that when, by continually attending upon him, 
<A NAME="404"></A>he has become perfect in all this, he calls his knowledge wisdom, and makes 
<A NAME="405"></A>of it a system or art, which he proceeds to teach, although he has no real 
<A NAME="406"></A>notion of what he means by the principles or passions of which he is speaking, 
<A NAME="407"></A>but calls this honourable and that dishonourable, or good or evil, or just 
<A NAME="408"></A>or unjust, all in accordance with the tastes and tempers of the great brute. 
<A NAME="409"></A>Good he pronounces to be that in which the beast delights and evil to be 
<A NAME="410"></A>that which he dislikes; and he can give no other account of them except 
<A NAME="411"></A>that the just and noble are the necessary, having never himself seen, and 
<A NAME="412"></A>having no power of explaining to others the nature of either, or the difference 
<A NAME="413"></A>between them, which is immense. By heaven, would not such an one be a rare 
<A NAME="414"></A>educator?
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, he would.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>And in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment of 
<A NAME="417"></A>the tempers and tastes of the motley multitude, whether in painting or 
<A NAME="418"></A>music, or, finally, in politics, differ from him whom I have been describing 
<A NAME="419"></A>For when a man consorts with the many, and exhibits to them his poem or 
<A NAME="420"></A>other work of art or the service which he has done the State, making them 
<A NAME="421"></A>his judges when he is not obliged, the so-called necessity of Diomede will 
<A NAME="422"></A>oblige him to produce whatever they praise. And yet the reasons are utterly 
<A NAME="423"></A>ludicrous which they give in confirmation of their own notions about the 
<A NAME="424"></A>honourable and good. Did you ever hear any of them which were 
<A NAME="425"></A>not?
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>No, nor am I likely to hear.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>You recognise the truth of what I have been saying? Then let me ask 
<A NAME="428"></A>you to consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe 
<A NAME="429"></A>in the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many beautiful, 
<A NAME="430"></A>or of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each 
<A NAME="431"></A>kind?
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Then the world cannot possibly be a philosopher?
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>And therefore philosophers must inevitably fall under the censure of 
<A NAME="436"></A>the world?
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>They must.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>And of individuals who consort with the mob and seek to please 
<A NAME="439"></A>them?
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>That is evident.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Then, do you see any way in which the philosopher can be preserved 
<A NAME="442"></A>in his calling to the end? and remember what we were saying of him, that 
<A NAME="443"></A>he was to have quickness and memory and courage and magnificence --these 
<A NAME="444"></A>were admitted by us to be the true philosopher's gifts.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Will not such an one from his early childhood be in all things first 
<A NAME="447"></A>among all, especially if his bodily endowments are like his mental 
<A NAME="448"></A>ones?
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>And his friends and fellow-citizens will want to use him as he gets 
<A NAME="451"></A>older for their own purposes?
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>No question.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Falling at his feet, they will make requests to him and do him honour 
<A NAME="454"></A>and flatter him, because they want to get into their hands now, the power 
<A NAME="455"></A>which he will one day possess.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>That often happens, he said.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>And what will a man such as he be likely to do under such circumstances, 
<A NAME="458"></A>especially if he be a citizen of a great city, rich and noble, and a tall 
<A NAME="459"></A>proper youth? Will he not be full of boundless aspirations, and fancy himself 
<A NAME="460"></A>able to manage the affairs of Hellenes and of barbarians, and having got 
<A NAME="461"></A>such notions into his head will he not dilate and elevate himself in the 
<A NAME="462"></A>fulness of vain pomp and senseless pride?
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>To be sure he will.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Now, when he is in this state of mind, if some one gently comes to 
<A NAME="465"></A>him and tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding, which can 
<A NAME="466"></A>only be got by slaving for it, do you think that, under such adverse circumstances, 
<A NAME="467"></A>he will be easily induced to listen?
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR>Far otherwise.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>And even if there be some one who through inherent goodness or natural 
<A NAME="470"></A>reasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and taken 
<A NAME="471"></A>captive by philosophy, how will his friends behave when they think that 
<A NAME="472"></A>they are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping to reap from 
<A NAME="473"></A>his companionship? Will they not do and say anything to prevent him from 
<A NAME="474"></A>yielding to his better nature and to render his teacher powerless, using 
<A NAME="475"></A>to this end private intrigues as well as public prosecutions?
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR>There can be no doubt of it.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>And how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a 
<A NAME="478"></A>philosopher?
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Then were we not right in saying that even the very qualities which 
<A NAME="481"></A>make a man a philosopher may, if he be ill-educated, divert him from philosophy, 
<A NAME="482"></A>no less than riches and their accompaniments and the other so-called goods 
<A NAME="483"></A>of life?
<A NAME="484"></A><BR><BR>We were quite right.
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Thus, my excellent friend, is brought about all that ruin and failure 
<A NAME="486"></A>which I have been describing of the natures best adapted to the best of 
<A NAME="487"></A>all pursuits; they are natures which we maintain to be rare at any time; 
<A NAME="488"></A>this being the class out of which come the men who are the authors of the 
<A NAME="489"></A>greatest evil to States and individuals; and also of the greatest good 
<A NAME="490"></A>when the tide carries them in that direction; but a small man never was 
<A NAME="491"></A>the doer of any great thing either to individuals or to 
<A NAME="492"></A>States.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR>That is most true, he said.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>And so philosophy is left desolate, with her marriage rite incomplete: 
<A NAME="495"></A>for her own have fallen away and forsaken her, and while they are leading 
<A NAME="496"></A>a false and unbecoming life, other unworthy persons, seeing that she has 
<A NAME="497"></A>no kinsmen to be her protectors, enter in and dishonour her; and fasten 
<A NAME="498"></A>upon her the reproaches which, as you say, her reprovers utter, who affirm 
<A NAME="499"></A>of her votaries that some are good for nothing, and that the greater number 
<A NAME="500"></A>deserve the severest punishment.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>That is certainly what people say.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Yes; and what else would you expect, I said, when you think of the 
<A NAME="503"></A>puny creatures who, seeing this land open to them --a land well stocked 
<A NAME="504"></A>with fair names and showy titles --like prisoners running out of prison 
<A NAME="505"></A>into a sanctuary, take a leap out of their trades into philosophy; those 
<A NAME="506"></A>who do so being probably the cleverest hands at their own miserable crafts? 
<A NAME="507"></A>For, although philosophy be in this evil case, still there remains a dignity 
<A NAME="508"></A>about her which is not to be found in the arts. And many are thus attracted 
<A NAME="509"></A>by her whose natures are imperfect and whose souls are maimed and disfigured 
<A NAME="510"></A>by their meannesses, as their bodies are by their trades and crafts. Is 
<A NAME="511"></A>not this unavoidable?
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Are they not exactly like a bald little tinker who has just got out 
<A NAME="514"></A>of durance and come into a fortune; he takes a bath and puts on a new coat, 
<A NAME="515"></A>and is decked out as a bridegroom going to marry his master's daughter, 
<A NAME="516"></A>who is left poor and desolate?
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>A most exact parallel.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>What will be the issue of such marriages? Will they not be vile and 
<A NAME="519"></A>bastard?
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>There can be no question of it.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>And when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy 
<A NAME="522"></A>and make an alliance with her who is a rank above them what sort of ideas 
<A NAME="523"></A>and opinions are likely to be generated? Will they not be sophisms captivating 
<A NAME="524"></A>to the ear, having nothing in them genuine, or worthy of or akin to true 
<A NAME="525"></A>wisdom?
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>No doubt, he said.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Then, Adeimantus, I said, the worthy disciples of philosophy will be 
<A NAME="528"></A>but a small remnant: perchance some noble and well-educated person, detained 
<A NAME="529"></A>by exile in her service, who in the absence of corrupting influences remains 
<A NAME="530"></A>devoted to her; or some lofty soul born in a mean city, the politics of 
<A NAME="531"></A>which he contemns and neglects; and there may be a gifted few who leave 
<A NAME="532"></A>the arts, which they justly despise, and come to her; --or peradventure 
<A NAME="533"></A>there are some who are restrained by our friend Theages' bridle; for everything 
<A NAME="534"></A>in the life of Theages conspired to divert him from philosophy; but ill-health 
<A NAME="535"></A>kept him away from politics. My own case of the internal sign is hardly 
<A NAME="536"></A>worth mentioning, for rarely, if ever, has such a monitor been given to 
<A NAME="537"></A>any other man. Those who belong to this small class have tasted how sweet 
<A NAME="538"></A>and blessed a possession philosophy is, and have also seen enough of the 
<A NAME="539"></A>madness of the multitude; and they know that no politician is honest, nor 
<A NAME="540"></A>is there any champion of justice at whose side they may fight and be saved. 
<A NAME="541"></A>Such an one may be compared to a man who has fallen among wild beasts --he 
<A NAME="542"></A>will not join in the wickedness of his fellows, but neither is he able 
<A NAME="543"></A>singly to resist all their fierce natures, and therefore seeing that he 
<A NAME="544"></A>would be of no use to the State or to his friends, and reflecting that 
<A NAME="545"></A>he would have to throw away his life without doing any good either to himself 
<A NAME="546"></A>or others, he holds his peace, and goes his own way. He is like one who, 
<A NAME="547"></A>in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along, retires 
<A NAME="548"></A>under the shelter of a wall; and seeing the rest of mankind full of wickedness, 
<A NAME="549"></A>he is content, if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or 
<A NAME="550"></A>unrighteousness, and depart in peace and good-will, with bright 
<A NAME="551"></A>hopes.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, and he will have done a great work before he 
<A NAME="553"></A>departs.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>A great work --yes; but not the greatest, unless he find a State suitable 
<A NAME="555"></A>to him; for in a State which is suitable to him, he will have a larger 
<A NAME="556"></A>growth and be the saviour of his country, as well as of 
<A NAME="557"></A>himself.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>The causes why philosophy is in such an evil name have now been 
<A NAME="559"></A>sufficiently explained: the injustice of the charges against her has been 
<A NAME="560"></A>shown-is there anything more which you wish to say?
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR>Nothing more on that subject, he replied; but I should like to 
<A NAME="562"></A>know which of the governments now existing is in your opinion the one adapted 
<A NAME="563"></A>to her.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>Not any of them, I said; and that is precisely the accusation which 
<A NAME="565"></A>I bring against them --not one of them is worthy of the philosophic nature, 
<A NAME="566"></A>and hence that nature is warped and estranged; --as the exotic seed which 
<A NAME="567"></A>is sown in a foreign land becomes denaturalized, and is wont to be overpowered 
<A NAME="568"></A>and to lose itself in the new soil, even so this growth of philosophy, 
<A NAME="569"></A>instead of persisting, degenerates and receives another character. But 
<A NAME="570"></A>if philosophy ever finds in the State that perfection which she herself 
<A NAME="571"></A>is, then will be seen that she is in truth divine, and that all other things, 
<A NAME="572"></A>whether natures of men or institutions, are but human; --and now, I know 
<A NAME="573"></A>that you are going to ask, what that State is.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>No, he said; there you are wrong, for I was going to ask another 
<A NAME="575"></A>question --whether it is the State of which. we are the founders and inventors, 
<A NAME="576"></A>or some other?
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I replied, ours in most respects; but you may remember my 
<A NAME="578"></A>saying before, that some living authority would always be required in the 
<A NAME="579"></A>State having the same idea of the constitution which guided you when as 
<A NAME="580"></A>legislator you were laying down the laws.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR>That was said, he replied.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Yes, but not in a satisfactory manner; you frightened us by interposing 
<A NAME="583"></A>objections, which certainly showed that the discussion would be long and 
<A NAME="584"></A>difficult; and what still remains is the reverse of 
<A NAME="585"></A>easy.
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR>What is there remaining?
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>The question how the study of philosophy may be so ordered as not to 
<A NAME="588"></A>be the ruin of the State: All great attempts are attended with risk; 'hard 
<A NAME="589"></A>is the good,' as men say.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>Still, he said, let the point be cleared up, and the enquiry will 
<A NAME="591"></A>then be complete.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>I shall not be hindered, I said, by any want of will, but, if at 
<A NAME="593"></A>all, by a want of power: my zeal you may see for yourselves; and please 
<A NAME="594"></A>to remark in what I am about to say how boldly and unhesitatingly I declare 
<A NAME="595"></A>that States should pursue philosophy, not as they do now, but in a different 
<A NAME="596"></A>spirit.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>In what manner?
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>At present, I said, the students of philosophy are quite young; beginning 
<A NAME="599"></A>when they are hardly past childhood, they devote only the time saved from 
<A NAME="600"></A>moneymaking and housekeeping to such pursuits; and even those of them who 
<A NAME="601"></A>are reputed to have most of the philosophic spirit, when they come within 
<A NAME="602"></A>sight of the great difficulty of the subject, I mean dialectic, take themselves 
<A NAME="603"></A>off. In after life when invited by some one else, they may, perhaps, go 
<A NAME="604"></A>and hear a lecture, and about this they make much ado, for philosophy is 
<A NAME="605"></A>not considered by them to be their proper business: at last, when they 
<A NAME="606"></A>grow old, in most cases they are extinguished more truly than Heracleitus' 
<A NAME="607"></A>sun, inasmuch as they never light up again.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>But what ought to be their course?
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Just the opposite. In childhood and youth their study, and what philosophy 
<A NAME="610"></A>they learn, should be suited to their tender years: during this period 
<A NAME="611"></A>while they are growing up towards manhood, the chief and special care should 
<A NAME="612"></A>be given to their bodies that they may have them to use in the service 
<A NAME="613"></A>of philosophy; as life advances and the intellect begins to mature, let 
<A NAME="614"></A>them increase the gymnastics of the soul; but when the strength of our 
<A NAME="615"></A>citizens fails and is past civil and military duties, then let them range 
<A NAME="616"></A>at will and engage in no serious labour, as we intend them to live happily 
<A NAME="617"></A>here, and to crown this life with a similar happiness in 
<A NAME="618"></A>another.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>How truly in earnest you are, Socrates! he said; I am sure of that; 
<A NAME="620"></A>and yet most of your hearers, if I am not mistaken, are likely to be still 
<A NAME="621"></A>more earnest in their opposition to you, and will never be convinced; Thrasymachus 
<A NAME="622"></A>least of all.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>Do not make a quarrel, I said, between Thrasymachus and me, who 
<A NAME="624"></A>have recently become friends, although, indeed, we were never enemies; 
<A NAME="625"></A>for I shall go on striving to the utmost until I either convert him and 
<A NAME="626"></A>other men, or do something which may profit them against the day when they 
<A NAME="627"></A>live again, and hold the like discourse in another state of 
<A NAME="628"></A>existence.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>You are speaking of a time which is not very 
<A NAME="630"></A>near.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Rather, I replied, of a time which is as nothing in comparison with 
<A NAME="632"></A>eternity. Nevertheless, I do not wonder that the many refuse to believe; 
<A NAME="633"></A>for they have never seen that of which we are now speaking realised; they 
<A NAME="634"></A>have seen only a conventional imitation of philosophy, consisting of words 
<A NAME="635"></A>artificially brought together, not like these of ours having a natural 
<A NAME="636"></A>unity. But a human being who in word and work is perfectly moulded, as 
<A NAME="637"></A>far as he can be, into the proportion and likeness of virtue --such a man 
<A NAME="638"></A>ruling in a city which bears the same image, they have never yet seen, 
<A NAME="639"></A>neither one nor many of them --do you think that they ever 
<A NAME="640"></A>did?
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>No indeed.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>No, my friend, and they have seldom, if ever, heard free and noble 
<A NAME="643"></A>sentiments; such as men utter when they are earnestly and by every means 
<A NAME="644"></A>in their power seeking after truth for the sake of knowledge, while they 
<A NAME="645"></A>look coldly on the subtleties of controversy, of which the end is opinion 
<A NAME="646"></A>and strife, whether they meet with them in the courts of law or in 
<A NAME="647"></A>society.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR>They are strangers, he said, to the words of which you 
<A NAME="649"></A>speak.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>And this was what we foresaw, and this was the reason why truth forced 
<A NAME="651"></A>us to admit, not without fear and hesitation, that neither cities nor States 
<A NAME="652"></A>nor individuals will ever attain perfection until the small class of philosophers 
<A NAME="653"></A>whom we termed useless but not corrupt are providentially compelled, whether 
<A NAME="654"></A>they will or not, to take care of the State, and until a like necessity 
<A NAME="655"></A>be laid on the State to obey them; or until kings, or if not kings, the 
<A NAME="656"></A>sons of kings or princes, are divinely inspired ' d with a true love of 
<A NAME="657"></A>true philosophy. That either or both of these alternatives are impossible, 
<A NAME="658"></A>I see no reason to affirm: if they were so, we might indeed be justly ridiculed 
<A NAME="659"></A>as dreamers and visionaries. Am I not right?
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR>Quite right.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>If then, in the countless ages of the past, or at the present hour 
<A NAME="662"></A>in some foreign clime which is far away and beyond our ken, the perfected 
<A NAME="663"></A>philosopher is or has been or hereafter shall be compelled by a superior 
<A NAME="664"></A>power to have the charge of the State, we are ready to assert to the death, 
<A NAME="665"></A>that this our constitution has been, and is --yea, and will be whenever 
<A NAME="666"></A>the Muse of Philosophy is queen. There is no impossibility in all this; 
<A NAME="667"></A>that there is a difficulty, we acknowledge ourselves.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR>My opinion agrees with yours, he said.
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>But do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the 
<A NAME="670"></A>multitude?
<A NAME="671"></A><BR><BR>I should imagine not, he replied.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>O my friend, I said, do not attack the multitude: they will change 
<A NAME="673"></A>their minds, if, not in an aggressive spirit, but gently and with the view 
<A NAME="674"></A>of soothing them and removing their dislike of over-education, you show 
<A NAME="675"></A>them your philosophers as they really are and describe as you were just 
<A NAME="676"></A>now doing their character and profession, and then mankind will see that 
<A NAME="677"></A>he of whom you are speaking is not such as they supposed --if they view 
<A NAME="678"></A>him in this new light, they will surely change their notion of him, and 
<A NAME="679"></A>answer in another strain. Who can be at enmity with one who loves them, 
<A NAME="680"></A>who that is himself gentle and free from envy will be jealous of one in 
<A NAME="681"></A>whom there is no jealousy? Nay, let me answer for you, that in a few this 
<A NAME="682"></A>harsh temper may be found but not in the majority of 
<A NAME="683"></A>mankind.
<A NAME="684"></A><BR><BR>I quite agree with you, he said.
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>And do you not also think, as I do, that the harsh feeling which the 
<A NAME="686"></A>many entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders, who rush 
<A NAME="687"></A>in uninvited, and are always abusing them, and finding fault with them, 
<A NAME="688"></A>who make persons instead of things the theme of their conversation? and 
<A NAME="689"></A>nothing can be more unbecoming in philosophers than 
<A NAME="690"></A>this.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>It is most unbecoming.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>For he, Adeimantus, whose mind is fixed upon true being, has surely 
<A NAME="693"></A>no time to look down upon the affairs of earth, or to be filled with malice 
<A NAME="694"></A>and envy, contending against men; his eye is ever directed towards things 
<A NAME="695"></A>fixed and immutable, which he sees neither injuring nor injured by one 
<A NAME="696"></A>another, but all in order moving according to reason; these he imitates, 
<A NAME="697"></A>and to these he will, as far as he can, conform himself. Can a man help 
<A NAME="698"></A>imitating that with which he holds reverential converse?
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>And the philosopher holding converse with the divine order, becomes 
<A NAME="701"></A>orderly and divine, as far as the nature of man allows; but like every 
<A NAME="702"></A>one else, he will suffer from detraction.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>And if a necessity be laid upon him of fashioning, not only himself, 
<A NAME="705"></A>but human nature generally, whether in States or individuals, into that 
<A NAME="706"></A>which he beholds elsewhere, will he, think you, be an unskilful artificer 
<A NAME="707"></A>of justice, temperance, and every civil virtue?
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>Anything but unskilful.
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>And if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the 
<A NAME="710"></A>truth, will they be angry with philosophy? Will they disbelieve us, when 
<A NAME="711"></A>we tell them that no State can be happy which is not designed by artists 
<A NAME="712"></A>who imitate the heavenly pattern?
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR>They will not be angry if they understand, he said. But how will 
<A NAME="714"></A>they draw out the plan of which you are speaking?
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>They will begin by taking the State and the manners of men, from 
<A NAME="716"></A>which, as from a tablet, they will rub out the picture, and leave a clean 
<A NAME="717"></A>surface. This is no easy task. But whether easy or not, herein will lie 
<A NAME="718"></A>the difference between them and every other legislator, --they will have 
<A NAME="719"></A>nothing to do either with individual or State, and will inscribe no laws, 
<A NAME="720"></A>until they have either found, or themselves made, a clean 
<A NAME="721"></A>surface.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>They will be very right, he said.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Having effected this, they will proceed to trace an outline of the 
<A NAME="724"></A>constitution?
<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR>No doubt.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>And when they are filling in the work, as I conceive, they will often 
<A NAME="727"></A>turn their eyes upwards and downwards: I mean that they will first look 
<A NAME="728"></A>at absolute justice and beauty and temperance, and again at the human copy; 
<A NAME="729"></A>and will mingle and temper the various elements of life into the image 
<A NAME="730"></A>of a man; and thus they will conceive according to that other image, which, 
<A NAME="731"></A>when existing among men, Homer calls the form and likeness of 
<A NAME="732"></A>God.
<A NAME="733"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>And one feature they will erase, and another they will put in, they 
<A NAME="735"></A>have made the ways of men, as far as possible, agreeable to the ways of 
<A NAME="736"></A>God?
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, he said, in no way could they make a fairer 
<A NAME="738"></A>picture.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>And now, I said, are we beginning to persuade those whom you described 
<A NAME="740"></A>as rushing at us with might and main, that the painter of constitutions 
<A NAME="741"></A>is such an one as we are praising; at whom they were so very indignant 
<A NAME="742"></A>because to his hands we committed the State; and are they growing a little 
<A NAME="743"></A>calmer at what they have just heard?
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR>Much calmer, if there is any sense in them.
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Why, where can they still find any ground for objection? Will they 
<A NAME="746"></A>doubt that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being?
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>They would not be so unreasonable.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Or that his nature, being such as we have delineated, is akin to the 
<A NAME="749"></A>highest good?
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR>Neither can they doubt this.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>But again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable 
<A NAME="752"></A>circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was? Or 
<A NAME="753"></A>will they prefer those whom we have rejected?
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>Surely not.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>Then will they still be angry at our saying, that, until philosophers 
<A NAME="756"></A>bear rule, States and individuals will have no rest from evil, nor will 
<A NAME="757"></A>this our imaginary State ever be realised?
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR>I think that they will be less angry.
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>Shall we assume that they are not only less angry but quite gentle, 
<A NAME="760"></A>and that they have been converted and for very shame, if for no other reason, 
<A NAME="761"></A>cannot refuse to come to terms?
<A NAME="762"></A><BR><BR>By all means, he said.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>Then let us suppose that the reconciliation has been effected. Will 
<A NAME="764"></A>any one deny the other point, that there may be sons of kings or princes 
<A NAME="765"></A>who are by nature philosophers?
<A NAME="766"></A><BR><BR>Surely no man, he said.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>And when they have come into being will any one say that they must 
<A NAME="768"></A>of necessity be destroyed; that they can hardly be saved is not denied 
<A NAME="769"></A>even by us; but that in the whole course of ages no single one of them 
<A NAME="770"></A>can escape --who will venture to affirm this?
<A NAME="771"></A><BR><BR>Who indeed!
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>But, said I, one is enough; let there be one man who has a city obedient 
<A NAME="773"></A>to his will, and he might bring into existence the ideal polity about which 
<A NAME="774"></A>the world is so incredulous.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR><BR>Yes, one is enough.
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>The ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been describing, 
<A NAME="777"></A>and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them?
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>And that others should approve of what we approve, is no miracle or 
<A NAME="780"></A>impossibility?
<A NAME="781"></A><BR><BR>I think not.
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>But we have sufficiently shown, in what has preceded, that all this, 
<A NAME="783"></A>if only possible, is assuredly for the best.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR><BR>We have.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>And now we say not only that our laws, if they could be enacted, would 
<A NAME="786"></A>be for the best, but also that the enactment of them, though difficult, 
<A NAME="787"></A>is not impossible.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR>Very good.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>And so with pain and toil we have reached the end of one subject, but 
<A NAME="790"></A>more remains to be discussed; --how and by what studies and pursuits will 
<A NAME="791"></A>the saviours of the constitution be created, and at what ages are they 
<A NAME="792"></A>to apply themselves to their several studies?
<A NAME="793"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>I omitted the troublesome business of the possession of women, and 
<A NAME="795"></A>the procreation of children, and the appointment of the rulers, because 
<A NAME="796"></A>I knew that the perfect State would be eyed with jealousy and was difficult 
<A NAME="797"></A>of attainment; but that piece of cleverness was not of much service to 
<A NAME="798"></A>me, for I had to discuss them all the same. The women and children are 
<A NAME="799"></A>now disposed of, but the other question of the rulers must be investigated 
<A NAME="800"></A>from the very beginning. We were saying, as you will remember, that they 
<A NAME="801"></A>were to be lovers of their country, tried by the test of pleasures and 
<A NAME="802"></A>pains, and neither in hardships, nor in dangers, nor at any other critical 
<A NAME="803"></A>moment were to lose their patriotism --he was to be rejected who failed, 
<A NAME="804"></A>but he who always came forth pure, like gold tried in the refiner's fire, 
<A NAME="805"></A>was to be made a ruler, and to receive honours and rewards in life and 
<A NAME="806"></A>after death. This was the sort of thing which was being said, and then 
<A NAME="807"></A>the argument turned aside and veiled her face; not liking to stir the question 
<A NAME="808"></A>which has now arisen.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR>I perfectly remember, he said.
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>Yes, my friend, I said, and I then shrank from hazarding the bold word; 
<A NAME="811"></A>but now let me dare to say --that the perfect guardian must be a 
<A NAME="812"></A>philosopher.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, let that be affirmed.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>And do not suppose that there will be many of them; for the gifts which 
<A NAME="815"></A>were deemed by us to be essential rarely grow together; they are mostly 
<A NAME="816"></A>found in shreds and patches.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean? he said.
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>You are aware, I replied, that quick intelligence, memory, sagacity, 
<A NAME="819"></A>cleverness, and similar qualities, do not often grow together, and that 
<A NAME="820"></A>persons who possess them and are at the same time high-spirited and magnanimous 
<A NAME="821"></A>are not so constituted by nature as to live orderly and in a peaceful and 
<A NAME="822"></A>settled manner; they are driven any way by their impulses, and all solid 
<A NAME="823"></A>principle goes out of them.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>On the other hand, those steadfast natures which can better be depended 
<A NAME="826"></A>upon, which in a battle are impregnable to fear and immovable, are equally 
<A NAME="827"></A>immovable when there is anything to be learned; they are always in a torpid 
<A NAME="828"></A>state, and are apt to yawn and go to sleep over any intellectual 
<A NAME="829"></A>toil.
<A NAME="830"></A><BR><BR>Quite true.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>And yet we were saying that both qualities were necessary in those 
<A NAME="832"></A>to whom the higher education is to be imparted, and who are to share in 
<A NAME="833"></A>any office or command.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>And will they be a class which is rarely found?
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>Yes, indeed.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>Then the aspirant must not only be tested in those labours and dangers 
<A NAME="838"></A>and pleasures which we mentioned before, but there is another kind of probation 
<A NAME="839"></A>which we did not mention --he must be exercised also in many kinds of knowledge, 
<A NAME="840"></A>to see whether the soul will be able to endure the highest of all, will 
<A NAME="841"></A>faint under them, as in any other studies and exercises.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, you are quite right in testing him. But what do you 
<A NAME="843"></A>mean by the highest of all knowledge?
<A NAME="844"></A><BR><BR>You may remember, I said, that we divided the soul into three parts; 
<A NAME="845"></A>and distinguished the several natures of justice, temperance, courage, 
<A NAME="846"></A>and wisdom?
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, he said, if I had forgotten, I should not deserve to hear 
<A NAME="848"></A>more.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR><BR>And do you remember the word of caution which preceded the discussion 
<A NAME="850"></A>of them?
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR>To what do you refer?
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>We were saying, if I am not mistaken, that he who wanted to see them 
<A NAME="853"></A>in their perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way, at 
<A NAME="854"></A>the end of which they would appear; but that we could add on a popular 
<A NAME="855"></A>exposition of them on a level with the discussion which had preceded. And 
<A NAME="856"></A>you replied that such an exposition would be enough for you, and so the 
<A NAME="857"></A>enquiry was continued in what to me seemed to be a very inaccurate manner; 
<A NAME="858"></A>whether you were satisfied or not, it is for you to 
<A NAME="859"></A>say.
<A NAME="860"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, I thought and the others thought that you gave us 
<A NAME="861"></A>a fair measure of truth.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR>But, my friend, I said, a measure of such things Which in any degree 
<A NAME="863"></A>falls short of the whole truth is not fair measure; for nothing imperfect 
<A NAME="864"></A>is the measure of anything, although persons are too apt to be contented 
<A NAME="865"></A>and think that they need search no further.
<A NAME="866"></A><BR><BR>Not an uncommon case when people are indolent.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>Yes, I said; and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of the 
<A NAME="868"></A>State and of the laws.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>The guardian then, I said, must be required to take the longer circuit, 
<A NAME="871"></A>and toll at learning as well as at gymnastics, or he will never reach the 
<A NAME="872"></A>highest knowledge of all which, as we were just now saying, is his proper 
<A NAME="873"></A>calling.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR>What, he said, is there a knowledge still higher than this --higher 
<A NAME="875"></A>than justice and the other virtues?
<A NAME="876"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said, there is. And of the virtues too we must behold not 
<A NAME="877"></A>the outline merely, as at present --nothing short of the most finished 
<A NAME="878"></A>picture should satisfy us. When little things are elaborated with an infinity 
<A NAME="879"></A>of pains, in order that they may appear in their full beauty and utmost 
<A NAME="880"></A>clearness, how ridiculous that we should not think the highest truths worthy 
<A NAME="881"></A>of attaining the highest accuracy!
<A NAME="882"></A><BR><BR>A right noble thought; but do you suppose that we shall refrain 
<A NAME="883"></A>from asking you what is this highest knowledge?
<A NAME="884"></A><BR><BR>Nay, I said, ask if you will; but I am certain that you have heard 
<A NAME="885"></A>the answer many times, and now you either do not understand me or, as I 
<A NAME="886"></A>rather think, you are disposed to be troublesome; for you have of been 
<A NAME="887"></A>told that the idea of good is the highest knowledge, and that all other 
<A NAME="888"></A>things become useful and advantageous only by their use of this. You can 
<A NAME="889"></A>hardly be ignorant that of this I was about to speak, concerning which, 
<A NAME="890"></A>as you have often heard me say, we know so little; and, without which, 
<A NAME="891"></A>any other knowledge or possession of any kind will profit us nothing. Do 
<A NAME="892"></A>you think that the possession of all other things is of any value if we 
<A NAME="893"></A>do not possess the good? or the knowledge of all other things if we have 
<A NAME="894"></A>no knowledge of beauty and goodness?
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR>Assuredly not.
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>You are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good, 
<A NAME="897"></A>but the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge
<A NAME="898"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>And you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean 
<A NAME="900"></A>by knowledge, but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the 
<A NAME="901"></A>good?
<A NAME="902"></A><BR><BR>How ridiculous!
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>Yes, I said, that they should begin by reproaching us with our ignorance 
<A NAME="904"></A>of the good, and then presume our knowledge of it --for the good they define 
<A NAME="905"></A>to be knowledge of the good, just as if we understood them when they use 
<A NAME="906"></A>the term 'good' --this is of course ridiculous.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR><BR>Most true, he said.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>And those who make pleasure their good are in equal perplexity; for 
<A NAME="909"></A>they are compelled to admit that there are bad pleasures as well as 
<A NAME="910"></A>good.
<A NAME="911"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>And therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the 
<A NAME="913"></A>same?
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>There can be no doubt about the numerous difficulties in which this 
<A NAME="916"></A>question is involved.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR>There can be none.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>Further, do we not see that many are willing to do or to have or to 
<A NAME="919"></A>seem to be what is just and honourable without the reality; but no one 
<A NAME="920"></A>is satisfied with the appearance of good --the reality is what they seek; 
<A NAME="921"></A>in the case of the good, appearance is despised by every 
<A NAME="922"></A>one.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>Of this then, which every soul of man pursues and makes the end of 
<A NAME="925"></A>all his actions, having a presentiment that there is such an end, and yet 
<A NAME="926"></A>hesitating because neither knowing the nature nor having the same assurance 
<A NAME="927"></A>of this as of other things, and therefore losing whatever good there is 
<A NAME="928"></A>in other things, --of a principle such and so great as this ought the best 
<A NAME="929"></A>men in our State, to whom everything is entrusted, to be in the darkness 
<A NAME="930"></A>of ignorance?
<A NAME="931"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not, he said.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>I am sure, I said, that he who does not know now the beautiful and 
<A NAME="933"></A>the just are likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them; and I 
<A NAME="934"></A>suspect that no one who is ignorant of the good will have a true knowledge 
<A NAME="935"></A>of them.
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR>That, he said, is a shrewd suspicion of yours.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>And if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our State will 
<A NAME="938"></A>be perfectly ordered?
<A NAME="939"></A><BR><BR>Of course, he replied; but I wish that you would tell me whether 
<A NAME="940"></A>you conceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure, 
<A NAME="941"></A>or different from either.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR><BR>Aye, I said, I knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like 
<A NAME="943"></A>you would not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these 
<A NAME="944"></A>matters.
<A NAME="945"></A><BR><BR>True, Socrates; but I must say that one who like you has passed 
<A NAME="946"></A>a lifetime in the study of philosophy should not be always repeating the 
<A NAME="947"></A>opinions of others, and never telling his own.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR><BR>Well, but has any one a right to say positively what he does not 
<A NAME="949"></A>know?
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><BR>Not, he said, with the assurance of positive certainty; he has 
<A NAME="951"></A>no right to do that: but he may say what he thinks, as a matter of 
<A NAME="952"></A>opinion.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR><BR>And do you not know, I said, that all mere opinions are bad, and 
<A NAME="954"></A>the best of them blind? You would not deny that those who have any true 
<A NAME="955"></A>notion without intelligence are only like blind men who feel their way 
<A NAME="956"></A>along the road?
<A NAME="957"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>And do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base, when 
<A NAME="959"></A>others will tell you of brightness and beauty?
<A NAME="960"></A><BR><BR>Glaucon - SOCRATES
<A NAME="961"></A><BR><BR>Still, I must implore you, Socrates, said Glaucon, not to turn 
<A NAME="962"></A>away just as you are reaching the goal; if you will only give such an explanation 
<A NAME="963"></A>of the good as you have already given of justice and temperance and the 
<A NAME="964"></A>other virtues, we shall be satisfied.
<A NAME="965"></A><BR><BR>Yes, my friend, and I shall be at least equally satisfied, but 
<A NAME="966"></A>I cannot help fearing that I shall fall, and that my indiscreet zeal will 
<A NAME="967"></A>bring ridicule upon me. No, sweet sirs, let us not at present ask what 
<A NAME="968"></A>is the actual nature of the good, for to reach what is now in my thoughts 
<A NAME="969"></A>would be an effort too great for me. But of the child of the good who is 
<A NAME="970"></A>likest him, I would fain speak, if I could be sure that you wished to hear 
<A NAME="971"></A>--otherwise, not.
<A NAME="972"></A><BR><BR>By all means, he said, tell us about the child, and you shall remain 
<A NAME="973"></A>in our debt for the account of the parent.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR><BR>I do indeed wish, I replied, that I could pay, and you receive, 
<A NAME="975"></A>the account of the parent, and not, as now, of the offspring only; take, 
<A NAME="976"></A>however, this latter by way of interest, and at the same time have a care 
<A NAME="977"></A>that i do not render a false account, although I have no intention of deceiving 
<A NAME="978"></A>you.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR><BR>Yes, we will take all the care that we can: 
<A NAME="980"></A>proceed.
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>Yes, I said, but I must first come to an understanding with you, and 
<A NAME="982"></A>remind you of what I have mentioned in the course of this discussion, and 
<A NAME="983"></A>at many other times.
<A NAME="984"></A><BR><BR>What?
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>The old story, that there is a many beautiful and a many good, and 
<A NAME="986"></A>so of other things which we describe and define; to all of them 'many' 
<A NAME="987"></A>is applied.
<A NAME="988"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>And there is an absolute beauty and an absolute good, and of other 
<A NAME="990"></A>things to which the term 'many' is applied there is an absolute; for they 
<A NAME="991"></A>may be brought under a single idea, which is called the essence of 
<A NAME="992"></A>each.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>The many, as we say, are seen but not known, and the ideas are known 
<A NAME="995"></A>but not seen.
<A NAME="996"></A><BR><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>And what is the organ with which we see the visible 
<A NAME="998"></A>things?
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>The sight, he said.
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>And with the hearing, I said, we hear, and with the other senses perceive 
<A NAME="1001"></A>the other objects of sense?
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>But have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex 
<A NAME="1004"></A>piece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever 
<A NAME="1005"></A>contrived?
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR><BR>No, I never have, he said.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>Then reflect; has the ear or voice need of any third or additional 
<A NAME="1008"></A>nature in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to be 
<A NAME="1009"></A>heard?
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR><BR>Nothing of the sort.
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>No, indeed, I replied; and the same is true of most, if not all, the 
<A NAME="1012"></A>other senses --you would not say that any of them requires such an 
<A NAME="1013"></A>addition?
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>But you see that without the addition of some other nature there is 
<A NAME="1016"></A>no seeing or being seen?
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR><BR>How do you mean?
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>Sight being, as I conceive, in the eyes, and he who has eyes wanting 
<A NAME="1019"></A>to see; colour being also present in them, still unless there be a third 
<A NAME="1020"></A>nature specially adapted to the purpose, the owner of the eyes will see 
<A NAME="1021"></A>nothing and the colours will be invisible.
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR><BR>Of what nature are you speaking?
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>Of that which you term light, I replied.
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>Noble, then, is the bond which links together sight and visibility, 
<A NAME="1026"></A>and great beyond other bonds by no small difference of nature; for light 
<A NAME="1027"></A>is their bond, and light is no ignoble thing?
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR><BR>Nay, he said, the reverse of ignoble.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>And which, I said, of the gods in heaven would you say was the lord 
<A NAME="1030"></A>of this element? Whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly 
<A NAME="1031"></A>and the visible to appear?
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR><BR>You mean the sun, as you and all mankind say.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>May not the relation of sight to this deity be described as 
<A NAME="1034"></A>follows?
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>How?
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>Neither sight nor the eye in which sight resides is the 
<A NAME="1037"></A>sun?
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>No.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>Yet of all the organs of sense the eye is the most like the 
<A NAME="1040"></A>sun?
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>By far the most like.
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>And the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which 
<A NAME="1043"></A>is dispensed from the sun?
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>Then the sun is not sight, but the author of sight who is recognised 
<A NAME="1046"></A>by sight.
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>And this is he whom I call the child of the good, whom the good begat 
<A NAME="1049"></A>in his own likeness, to be in the visible world, in relation to sight and 
<A NAME="1050"></A>the things of sight, what the good is in the intellectual world in relation 
<A NAME="1051"></A>to mind and the things of mind.
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR><BR>Will you be a little more explicit? he said.
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>Why, you know, I said, that the eyes, when a person directs them towards 
<A NAME="1054"></A>objects on which the light of day is no longer shining, but the moon and 
<A NAME="1055"></A>stars only, see dimly, and are nearly blind; they seem to have no clearness 
<A NAME="1056"></A>of vision in them?
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>But when they are directed towards objects on which the sun shines, 
<A NAME="1059"></A>they see clearly and there is sight in them?
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>And the soul is like the eye: when resting upon that on which truth 
<A NAME="1062"></A>and being shine, the soul perceives and understands and is radiant with 
<A NAME="1063"></A>intelligence; but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and perishing, 
<A NAME="1064"></A>then she has opinion only, and goes blinking about, and is first of one 
<A NAME="1065"></A>opinion and then of another, and seems to have no intelligence?
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR><BR>Just so.
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>Now, that which imparts truth to the known and the power of knowing 
<A NAME="1068"></A>to the knower is what I would have you term the idea of good, and this 
<A NAME="1069"></A>you will deem to be the cause of science, and of truth in so far as the 
<A NAME="1070"></A>latter becomes the subject of knowledge; beautiful too, as are both truth 
<A NAME="1071"></A>and knowledge, you will be right in esteeming this other nature as more 
<A NAME="1072"></A>beautiful than either; and, as in the previous instance, light and sight 
<A NAME="1073"></A>may be truly said to be like the sun, and yet not to be the sun, so in 
<A NAME="1074"></A>this other sphere, science and truth may be deemed to be like the good, 
<A NAME="1075"></A>but not the good; the good has a place of honour yet 
<A NAME="1076"></A>higher.
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR><BR>What a wonder of beauty that must be, he said, which is the author 
<A NAME="1078"></A>of science and truth, and yet surpasses them in beauty; for you surely 
<A NAME="1079"></A>cannot mean to say that pleasure is the good?
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR><BR>God forbid, I replied; but may I ask you to consider the image 
<A NAME="1081"></A>in another point of view?
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR><BR>In what point of view?
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>You would say, would you not, that the sun is only the author of visibility 
<A NAME="1084"></A>in all visible things, but of generation and nourishment and growth, though 
<A NAME="1085"></A>he himself is not generation?
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>In like manner the good may be said to be not only the author of knowledge 
<A NAME="1088"></A>to all things known, but of their being and essence, and yet the good is 
<A NAME="1089"></A>not essence, but far exceeds essence in dignity and 
<A NAME="1090"></A>power.
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR><BR>Glaucon said, with a ludicrous earnestness: By the light of heaven, 
<A NAME="1092"></A>how amazing!
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said, and the exaggeration may be set down to you; for you 
<A NAME="1094"></A>made me utter my fancies.
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR><BR>And pray continue to utter them; at any rate let us hear if there 
<A NAME="1096"></A>is anything more to be said about the similitude of the 
<A NAME="1097"></A>sun.
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said, there is a great deal more.
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>Then omit nothing, however slight.
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>I will do my best, I said; but I should think that a great deal will 
<A NAME="1101"></A>have to be omitted.
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR><BR>You have to imagine, then, that there are two ruling powers, and 
<A NAME="1103"></A>that one of them is set over the intellectual world, the other over the 
<A NAME="1104"></A>visible. I do not say heaven, lest you should fancy that I am playing upon 
<A NAME="1105"></A>the name ('ourhanoz, orhatoz'). May I suppose that you have this distinction 
<A NAME="1106"></A>of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR><BR>I have.
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>Now take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts, and divide 
<A NAME="1109"></A>each of them again in the same proportion, and suppose the two main divisions 
<A NAME="1110"></A>to answer, one to the visible and the other to the intelligible, and then 
<A NAME="1111"></A>compare the subdivisions in respect of their clearness and want of clearness, 
<A NAME="1112"></A>and you will find that the first section in the sphere of the visible consists 
<A NAME="1113"></A>of images. And by images I mean, in the first place, shadows, and in the 
<A NAME="1114"></A>second place, reflections in water and in solid, smooth and polished bodies 
<A NAME="1115"></A>and the like: Do you understand?
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I understand.
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>Imagine, now, the other section, of which this is only the resemblance, 
<A NAME="1118"></A>to include the animals which we see, and everything that grows or is 
<A NAME="1119"></A>made.
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR><BR>Very good.
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>Would you not admit that both the sections of this division have different 
<A NAME="1122"></A>degrees of truth, and that the copy is to the original as the sphere of 
<A NAME="1123"></A>opinion is to the sphere of knowledge?
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR><BR>Most undoubtedly.
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>Next proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the intellectual 
<A NAME="1126"></A>is to be divided.
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR><BR>In what manner?
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>Thus: --There are two subdivisions, in the lower or which the soul 
<A NAME="1129"></A>uses the figures given by the former division as images; the enquiry can 
<A NAME="1130"></A>only be hypothetical, and instead of going upwards to a principle descends 
<A NAME="1131"></A>to the other end; in the higher of the two, the soul passes out of hypotheses, 
<A NAME="1132"></A>and goes up to a principle which is above hypotheses, making no use of 
<A NAME="1133"></A>images as in the former case, but proceeding only in and through the ideas 
<A NAME="1134"></A>themselves.
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR><BR>I do not quite understand your meaning, he said.
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>Then I will try again; you will understand me better when I have made 
<A NAME="1137"></A>some preliminary remarks. You are aware that students of geometry, arithmetic, 
<A NAME="1138"></A>and the kindred sciences assume the odd and the even and the figures and 
<A NAME="1139"></A>three kinds of angles and the like in their several branches of science; 
<A NAME="1140"></A>these are their hypotheses, which they and everybody are supposed to know, 
<A NAME="1141"></A>and therefore they do not deign to give any account of them either to themselves 
<A NAME="1142"></A>or others; but they begin with them, and go on until they arrive at last, 
<A NAME="1143"></A>and in a consistent manner, at their conclusion?
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, I know.
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR>And do you not know also that although they make use of the visible 
<A NAME="1146"></A>forms and reason about them, they are thinking not of these, but of the 
<A NAME="1147"></A>ideals which they resemble; not of the figures which they draw, but of 
<A NAME="1148"></A>the absolute square and the absolute diameter, and so on --the forms which 
<A NAME="1149"></A>they draw or make, and which have shadows and reflections in water of their 
<A NAME="1150"></A>own, are converted by them into images, but they are really seeking to 
<A NAME="1151"></A>behold the things themselves, which can only be seen with the eye of the 
<A NAME="1152"></A>mind?
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR>And of this kind I spoke as the intelligible, although in the search 
<A NAME="1155"></A>after it the soul is compelled to use hypotheses; not ascending to a first 
<A NAME="1156"></A>principle, because she is unable to rise above the region of hypothesis, 
<A NAME="1157"></A>but employing the objects of which the shadows below are resemblances in 
<A NAME="1158"></A>their turn as images, they having in relation to the shadows and reflections 
<A NAME="1159"></A>of them a greater distinctness, and therefore a higher 
<A NAME="1160"></A>value.
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR><BR>I understand, he said, that you are speaking of the province of 
<A NAME="1162"></A>geometry and the sister arts.
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR><BR>And when I speak of the other division of the intelligible, you 
<A NAME="1164"></A>will understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason 
<A NAME="1165"></A>herself attains by the power of dialectic, using the hypotheses not as 
<A NAME="1166"></A>first principles, but only as hypotheses --that is to say, as steps and 
<A NAME="1167"></A>points of departure into a world which is above hypotheses, in order that 
<A NAME="1168"></A>she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole; and clinging 
<A NAME="1169"></A>to this and then to that which depends on this, by successive steps she 
<A NAME="1170"></A>descends again without the aid of any sensible object, from ideas, through 
<A NAME="1171"></A>ideas, and in ideas she ends.
<A NAME="1172"></A><BR><BR>I understand you, he replied; not perfectly, for you seem to me 
<A NAME="1173"></A>to be describing a task which is really tremendous; but, at any rate, I 
<A NAME="1174"></A>understand you to say that knowledge and being, which the science of dialectic 
<A NAME="1175"></A>contemplates, are clearer than the notions of the arts, as they are termed, 
<A NAME="1176"></A>which proceed from hypotheses only: these are also contemplated by the 
<A NAME="1177"></A>understanding, and not by the senses: yet, because they start from hypotheses 
<A NAME="1178"></A>and do not ascend to a principle, those who contemplate them appear to 
<A NAME="1179"></A>you not to exercise the higher reason upon them, although when a first 
<A NAME="1180"></A>principle is added to them they are cognizable by the higher reason. And 
<A NAME="1181"></A>the habit which is concerned with geometry and the cognate sciences I suppose 
<A NAME="1182"></A>that you would term understanding and not reason, as being intermediate 
<A NAME="1183"></A>between opinion and reason.
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR><BR>You have quite conceived my meaning, I said; and now, corresponding 
<A NAME="1185"></A>to these four divisions, let there be four faculties in the soul-reason 
<A NAME="1186"></A>answering to the highest, understanding to the second, faith (or conviction) 
<A NAME="1187"></A>to the third, and perception of shadows to the last-and let there be a 
<A NAME="1188"></A>scale of them, and let us suppose that the several faculties have clearness 
<A NAME="1189"></A>in the same degree that their objects have truth.
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR><BR>I understand, he replied, and give my assent, and accept your 
<A NAME="1191"></A>arrangement.
