<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>And now having spoken of assaults, let us sum up all acts of violence under 
<A NAME="11"></A>a single law, which shall be as follows:-No one shall take or carry away 
<A NAME="12"></A>any of his neighbour's goods, neither shall he use anything which is his 
<A NAME="13"></A>neighbour's without the consent of the owner; for these are the offences 
<A NAME="14"></A>which are and have been, and will ever be, the source of all the aforesaid 
<A NAME="15"></A>evils. The greatest of them are excesses and insolences of youth, and are 
<A NAME="16"></A>offences against the greatest when they are done against religion; and 
<A NAME="17"></A>especially great when in violation of public and holy rites, or of the 
<A NAME="18"></A>partly-common rites in which tribes and phratries share; and in the second 
<A NAME="19"></A>degree great when they are committed against private rites and sepulchres, 
<A NAME="20"></A>and in the third degree (not to repeat the acts formerly mentioned), when 
<A NAME="21"></A>insults are offered to parents; the fourth kind of violence is when any 
<A NAME="22"></A>one, regardless of the authority of the rulers, takes or carries away or 
<A NAME="23"></A>makes use of anything which belongs to them, not having their consent; 
<A NAME="24"></A>and the fifth kind is when the violation of the civil rights of an individual 
<A NAME="25"></A>demands reparation. There should be a common law embracing all these cases. 
<A NAME="26"></A>For we have already said in general terms what shall be the punishment 
<A NAME="27"></A>of sacrilege, whether fraudulent or violent, and now we have to determine 
<A NAME="28"></A>what is to be the punishment of those who speak or act insolently toward 
<A NAME="29"></A>the Gods. But first we must give them an admonition which may be in the 
<A NAME="30"></A>following terms:-No one who in obedience to the laws believed that there 
<A NAME="31"></A>were Gods, ever intentionally did any unholy act, or uttered any unlawful 
<A NAME="32"></A>word; but he who did must have supposed one of three things-either that 
<A NAME="33"></A>they did not exist,-which is the first possibility, or secondly, that, 
<A NAME="34"></A>if they did, they took no care of man, or thirdly, that they were easily 
<A NAME="35"></A>appeased and turned aside from their purpose, by sacrifices and 
<A NAME="36"></A>prayers.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR><B>Cleinias.</B> What shall we say or do to these 
<A NAME="38"></A>persons?
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Athenian Stranger. My good friend, let us first hear the jests which 
<A NAME="40"></A>I suspect that they in their superiority will utter against 
<A NAME="41"></A>us.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What jests?
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> They will make some irreverent speech of this sort:-"O 
<A NAME="44"></A>inhabitants of Athens, and Sparta, and Cnosus," they will reply, "in that 
<A NAME="45"></A>you speak truly; for some of us deny the very existence of the Gods, while 
<A NAME="46"></A>others, as you say, are of opinion that they do not care about us; and 
<A NAME="47"></A>others that they are turned from their course by gifts. Now we have a right 
<A NAME="48"></A>to claim, as you yourself allowed, in the matter of laws, that before you 
<A NAME="49"></A>are hard upon us and threaten us, you should argue with us and convince 
<A NAME="50"></A>us-you should first attempt to teach and persuade us that there are Gods 
<A NAME="51"></A>by reasonable evidences, and also that they are too good to be unrighteous, 
<A NAME="52"></A>or to be propitiated, or turned from their course by gifts. For when we 
<A NAME="53"></A>hear such things said of them by those who are esteemed to be the best 
<A NAME="54"></A>of poets, and orators, and prophets, and priests, and by innumerable others, 
<A NAME="55"></A>the thoughts of most of us are not set upon abstaining from unrighteous 
<A NAME="56"></A>acts, but upon doing them and atoning for them. When lawgivers profess 
<A NAME="57"></A>that they are gentle and not stern, we think that they should first of 
<A NAME="58"></A>all use persuasion to us, and show us the existence of Gods, if not in 
<A NAME="59"></A>a better manner than other men, at any rate in a truer; and who knows but 
<A NAME="60"></A>that we shall hearken to you? If then our request is a fair one, please 
<A NAME="61"></A>to accept our challenge."
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> But is there any difficulty in proving the existence 
<A NAME="63"></A>of the Gods?
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> How would you prove it?
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> How? In the first place, the earth and the sun, and the 
<A NAME="66"></A>stars and the universe, and the fair order of the seasons, and the division 
<A NAME="67"></A>of them into years and months, furnish proofs of their existence; and also 
<A NAME="68"></A>there is the fact that all Hellenes and barbarians believe in 
<A NAME="69"></A>them.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> I fear, my sweet friend, though I will not say that 
<A NAME="71"></A>I much regard, the contempt with which the profane will be likely to assail 
<A NAME="72"></A>us. For you do not understand the nature of their complaint, and you fancy 
<A NAME="73"></A>that they rush into impiety only from a love of sensual 
<A NAME="74"></A>pleasure.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Why, Stranger, what other reason is 
<A NAME="76"></A>there?
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> One which you who live in a different atmosphere would 
<A NAME="78"></A>never guess.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> A very grievous sort of ignorance which is imagined to 
<A NAME="81"></A>be the greatest wisdom.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> At Athens there are tales preserved in writing which the 
<A NAME="84"></A>virtue of your state, as I am informed, refuses to admit. They speak of 
<A NAME="85"></A>the Gods in prose as well as verse, and the oldest of them tell of the 
<A NAME="86"></A>origin of the heavens and of the world, and not far from the beginning 
<A NAME="87"></A>of their story they proceed to narrate the birth of the Gods, and how after 
<A NAME="88"></A>they were born they behaved to one another. Whether these stories have 
<A NAME="89"></A>in other ways a good or a bad influence, I should not like to be severe 
<A NAME="90"></A>upon them, because they are ancient; but, looking at them with reference 
<A NAME="91"></A>to the duties of children to their parents, I cannot praise them, or think 
<A NAME="92"></A>that they are useful, or at all true. Of the words of the ancients I have 
<A NAME="93"></A>nothing more to say; and I should wish to say of them only what is pleasing 
<A NAME="94"></A>to the Gods. But as to our younger generation and their wisdom, I cannot 
<A NAME="95"></A>let them off when they do mischief. For do but mark the effect of their 
<A NAME="96"></A>words: when you and I argue for the existence of the Gods, and produce 
<A NAME="97"></A>the sun, moon, stars, and earth, claiming for them a divine being, if we 
<A NAME="98"></A>would listen to the aforesaid philosophers we should say that they are 
<A NAME="99"></A>earth and stones only, which can have no care at all of human affairs, 
<A NAME="100"></A>and that all religion is a cooking up of words and a 
<A NAME="101"></A>make-believe.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> One such teacher, O Stranger, would be bad enough, 
<A NAME="103"></A>and you imply that there are many of them, which is 
<A NAME="104"></A>worse.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Well, then; what shall we say or do?-Shall we assume 
<A NAME="106"></A>that some one is accusing us among unholy men, who are trying to escape 
<A NAME="107"></A>from the effect of our legislation; and that they say of us-How dreadful 
<A NAME="108"></A>that you should legislate on the supposition that there are Gods! Shall 
<A NAME="109"></A>we make a defence of ourselves? or shall we leave them and return to our 
<A NAME="110"></A>laws, lest the prelude should become longer than the law? For the discourse 
<A NAME="111"></A>will certainly extend to great length, if we are to treat the impiously 
<A NAME="112"></A>disposed as they desire, partly demonstrating to them at some length the 
<A NAME="113"></A>things of which they demand an explanation, partly making them afraid or 
<A NAME="114"></A>dissatisfied, and then proceed to the requisite enactments.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes, Stranger; but then how often have we repeated 
<A NAME="116"></A>already that on the present occasion there is no reason why brevity should 
<A NAME="117"></A>be preferred to length; who is "at our heels"?-as the saying goes, and 
<A NAME="118"></A>it would be paltry and ridiculous to prefer the shorter to the better. 
<A NAME="119"></A>It is a matter of no small consequence, in some way or other to prove that 
<A NAME="120"></A>there are Gods, and that they are good, and regard justice more than men 
<A NAME="121"></A>do. The demonstration of this would be the best and noblest prelude of 
<A NAME="122"></A>all our laws. And therefore, without impatience, and without hurry, let 
<A NAME="123"></A>us unreservedly consider the whole matter, summoning up all the power of 
<A NAME="124"></A>persuasion which we possess.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Seeing you thus in earnest, I would fain offer up a 
<A NAME="126"></A>prayer that I may succeed:-but I must proceed at once. Who can be calm 
<A NAME="127"></A>when he is called upon to prove the existence of the Gods? Who can avoid 
<A NAME="128"></A>hating and abhorring the men who are and have been the cause of this argument; 
<A NAME="129"></A>I speak of those who will not believe the tales which they have heard as 
<A NAME="130"></A>babes and sucklings from their mothers and nurses, repeated by them both 
<A NAME="131"></A>in jest and earnest, like charms, who have also heard them in the sacrificial 
<A NAME="132"></A>prayers, and seen sights accompanying them-sights and sounds delightful 
<A NAME="133"></A>to children-and their parents during the sacrifices showing an intense 
<A NAME="134"></A>earnestness on behalf of their children and of themselves, and with eager 
<A NAME="135"></A>interest talking to the Gods, and beseeching them, as though they were 
<A NAME="136"></A>firmly convinced of their existence; who likewise see and hear the prostrations 
<A NAME="137"></A>and invocations which are made by Hellenes and barbarians at the rising 
<A NAME="138"></A>and setting of the sun and moon, in all the vicissitudes of life, not as 
<A NAME="139"></A>if they thought that there were no Gods, but as if there could be no doubt 
<A NAME="140"></A>of their existence, and no suspicion of their non-existence; when men, 
<A NAME="141"></A>knowing all these things, despise them on no real grounds, as would be 
<A NAME="142"></A>admitted by all who have any particle of intelligence, and when they force 
<A NAME="143"></A>us to say what we are now saying, how can any one in gentle terms remonstrate 
<A NAME="144"></A>with the like of them, when he has to begin by proving to them the very 
<A NAME="145"></A>existence of the Gods? Yet the attempt must be made; for it would be unseemly 
<A NAME="146"></A>that one half of mankind should go mad in their lust of pleasure, and the 
<A NAME="147"></A>other half in their indignation at such persons. Our address to these lost 
<A NAME="148"></A>and perverted natures should not be spoken in passion; let us suppose ourselves 
<A NAME="149"></A>to select some one of them, and gently reason with him, smothering our 
<A NAME="150"></A>anger:-O my son, we will say to him, you are young, and the advance of 
<A NAME="151"></A>time will make you reverse may of the opinions which you now hold. Wait 
<A NAME="152"></A>awhile, and do not attempt to judge at present of the highest things; and 
<A NAME="153"></A>that is the highest of which you now think nothing-to know the Gods rightly 
<A NAME="154"></A>and to live accordingly. And in the first place let me indicate to you 
<A NAME="155"></A>one point which is of great importance, and about which I cannot be deceived:-You 
<A NAME="156"></A>and your friends are not the first who have held this opinion about the 
<A NAME="157"></A>Gods. There have always been persons more or less numerous who have had 
<A NAME="158"></A>the same disorder. I have known many of them, and can tell you, that no 
<A NAME="159"></A>one who had taken up in youth this opinion, that the Gods do not exist, 
<A NAME="160"></A>ever continued in the same until he was old; the two other notions certainly 
<A NAME="161"></A>do continue in some cases, but not in many; the notion, I mean, that the 
<A NAME="162"></A>Gods exist, but take no heed of human things, and the other notion that 
<A NAME="163"></A>they do take heed of them, but are easily propitiated with sacrifices and 
<A NAME="164"></A>prayers. As to the opinion about the Gods which may some day become clear 
<A NAME="165"></A>to you, I advise you go wait and consider if it be true or not; ask of 
<A NAME="166"></A>others, and above all of the legislator. In the meantime take care that 
<A NAME="167"></A>you do not offend against the Gods. For the duty of the legislator is and 
<A NAME="168"></A>always will be to teach you the truth of these matters.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Our address, Stranger, thus far, is 
<A NAME="170"></A>excellent.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Quite true, Megillus and Cleinias, but I am afraid that 
<A NAME="172"></A>we have unconsciously lighted on a strange doctrine.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What doctrine do you mean?
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The wisest of all doctrines, in the opinion of 
<A NAME="175"></A>many.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> I wish that you would speak plainer.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The doctrine that all things do become, have become, and 
<A NAME="178"></A>will become, some by nature, some by art, and some by 
<A NAME="179"></A>chance.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Is not that true?
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Well, philosophers are probably right; at any rate we may 
<A NAME="182"></A>as well follow in their track, and examine what is the meaning of them 
<A NAME="183"></A>and their disciples.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> They say that the greatest and fairest things are the work 
<A NAME="186"></A>of nature and of chance, the lesser of art, which, receiving from nature 
<A NAME="187"></A>the greater and primeval creations, moulds and fashions all those lesser 
<A NAME="188"></A>works which are generally termed artificial.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How is that?
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I will explain my meaning still more clearly. They say 
<A NAME="191"></A>that fire and water, and earth and air, all exist by nature and chance, 
<A NAME="192"></A>and none of them by art, and that as to the bodies which come next in order-earth, 
<A NAME="193"></A>and sun, and moon, and stars-they have been created by means of these absolutely 
<A NAME="194"></A>inanimate existences. The elements are severally moved by chance and some 
<A NAME="195"></A>inherent force according to certain affinities among them-of hot with cold, 
<A NAME="196"></A>or of dry with moist, or of soft with hard, and according to all the other 
<A NAME="197"></A>accidental admixtures of opposites which have been formed by necessity. 
<A NAME="198"></A>After this fashion and in this manner the whole heaven has been created, 
<A NAME="199"></A>and all that is in the heaven, as well as animals and all plants, and all 
<A NAME="200"></A>the seasons come from these elements, not by the action of mind, as they 
<A NAME="201"></A>say, or of any God, or from art, but as I was saying, by nature and chance 
<A NAME="202"></A>only. Art sprang up afterwards and out of these, mortal and of mortal birth, 
<A NAME="203"></A>and produced in play certain images and very partial imitations of the 
<A NAME="204"></A>truth, having an affinity to one another, such as music and painting create 
<A NAME="205"></A>and their companion arts. And there are other arts which have a serious 
<A NAME="206"></A>purpose, and these co-operate with nature, such, for example, as medicine, 
<A NAME="207"></A>and husbandry, and gymnastic. And they say that politics cooperate with 
<A NAME="208"></A>nature, but in a less degree, and have more of art; also that legislation 
<A NAME="209"></A>is entirely a work of art, and is based on assumptions which are not 
<A NAME="210"></A>true.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How do you mean?
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In the first place, my dear friend, these people would 
<A NAME="213"></A>say that the Gods exist not by nature, but by art, and by the laws of states, 
<A NAME="214"></A>which are different in different places, according to the agreement of 
<A NAME="215"></A>those who make them; and that the honourable is one thing by nature and 
<A NAME="216"></A>another thing by law, and that the principles of justice have no existence 
<A NAME="217"></A>at all in nature, but that mankind are always disputing about them and 
<A NAME="218"></A>altering them; and that the alterations which are made by art and by law 
<A NAME="219"></A>have no basis in nature, but are of authority for the moment and at the 
<A NAME="220"></A>time at which they are made.-These, my friends, are the sayings of wise 
<A NAME="221"></A>men, poets and prose writers, which find a way into the minds of youth. 
<A NAME="222"></A>They are told by them that the highest right is might, and in this way 
<A NAME="223"></A>the young fall into impieties, under the idea that the Gods are not such 
<A NAME="224"></A>as the law bids them imagine; and hence arise factions, these philosophers 
<A NAME="225"></A>inviting them to lead a true life according to nature, that is, to live 
<A NAME="226"></A>in real dominion over others, and not in legal subjection to 
<A NAME="227"></A>them.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What a dreadful picture, Stranger, have you given, 
<A NAME="229"></A>and how great is the injury which is thus inflicted on young men to the 
<A NAME="230"></A>ruin both of states and families!
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> True, Cleinias; but then what should the lawgiver do 
<A NAME="232"></A>when this evil is of long standing? should he only rise up in the state 
<A NAME="233"></A>and threaten all mankind, proclaiming that if they will not say and think 
<A NAME="234"></A>that the Gods are such as the law ordains (and this may be extended generally 
<A NAME="235"></A>to the honourable, the just, and to all the highest things, and to all 
<A NAME="236"></A>that relates to virtue and vice), and if they will not make their actions 
<A NAME="237"></A>conform to the copy which the law gives them, then he who refuses to obey 
<A NAME="238"></A>the law shall die, or suffer stripes and bonds, or privation of citizenship, 
<A NAME="239"></A>or in some cases be punished by loss of property and exile? Should he not 
<A NAME="240"></A>rather, when he is making laws for men, at the same time infuse the spirit 
<A NAME="241"></A>of persuasion into his words, and mitigate the severity of them as far 
<A NAME="242"></A>as he can?
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Why, Stranger, if such persuasion be at all possible, 
<A NAME="244"></A>then a legislator who has anything in him ought never to weary of persuading 
<A NAME="245"></A>men; he ought to leave nothing unsaid in support of the ancient opinion 
<A NAME="246"></A>that there are Gods, and of all those other truths which you were just 
<A NAME="247"></A>now mentioning; he ought to support the law and also art, and acknowledge 
<A NAME="248"></A>that both alike exist by nature, and no less than nature, if they are the 
<A NAME="249"></A>creations of mind in accordance with right reason, you appear to me to 
<A NAME="250"></A>maintain, and I am disposed to agree with you in thinking.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes, my enthusiastic Cleinias; but are not these things 
<A NAME="252"></A>when spoken to a multitude hard to be understood, not to mention that they 
<A NAME="253"></A>take up a dismal length of time?
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Why, Stranger, shall we, whose patience failed not 
<A NAME="255"></A>when drinking or music were the themes of discourse, weary now of discoursing 
<A NAME="256"></A>about the Gods, and about divine things? And the greatest help to rational 
<A NAME="257"></A>legislation is that the laws when once written down are always at rest; 
<A NAME="258"></A>they can be put to the test at any future time, and therefore, if on first 
<A NAME="259"></A>hearing they seem difficult, there is no reason for apprehension about 
<A NAME="260"></A>them, because any man however dull can go over them and consider them again 
<A NAME="261"></A>and again; nor if they are tedious but useful, is there any reason or religion, 
<A NAME="262"></A>as it seems to me, in any man refusing to maintain the principles of them 
<A NAME="263"></A>to the utmost of his power.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR><B>Megillus.</B> Stranger, I like what Cleinias is 
<A NAME="265"></A>saying.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes, Megillus, and we should do as he proposes; for if 
<A NAME="267"></A>impious discourses were not scattered, as I may say, throughout the world, 
<A NAME="268"></A>there would have been no need for any vindication of the existence of the 
<A NAME="269"></A>Gods-but seeing that they are spread far and wide, such arguments are needed; 
<A NAME="270"></A>and who should come to the rescue of the greatest laws, when they are being 
<A NAME="271"></A>undermined by bad men, but the legislator himself?
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> There is no more proper champion of 
<A NAME="273"></A>them.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Well, then, tell me, Cleinias-for I must ask you to be 
<A NAME="275"></A>my partner-does not he who talks in this way conceive fire and water and 
<A NAME="276"></A>earth and air to be the first elements of all things? These he calls nature, 
<A NAME="277"></A>and out of these he supposes the soul to be formed afterwards; and this 
<A NAME="278"></A>is not a mere conjecture of ours about his meaning, but is what he really 
<A NAME="279"></A>means.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then, by Heaven, we have discovered the source of this 
<A NAME="282"></A>vain opinion of all those physical investigators; and I would have you 
<A NAME="283"></A>examine their arguments with the utmost care, for their impiety is a very 
<A NAME="284"></A>serious matter; they not only make a bad and mistaken use of argument, 
<A NAME="285"></A>but they lead away the minds of others: that is my opinion of 
<A NAME="286"></A>them.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> You are right; but I should like to know how this 
<A NAME="288"></A>happens.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I fear that the argument may seem singular.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Do not hesitate, Stranger; I see that you are afraid of 
<A NAME="291"></A>such a discussion carrying you beyond the limits of legislation. But if 
<A NAME="292"></A>there be no other way of showing our agreement in the belief that there 
<A NAME="293"></A>are Gods, of whom the law is said now to approve, let us take this way, 
<A NAME="294"></A>my good sir.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then I suppose that I must repeat the singular argument 
<A NAME="296"></A>of those who manufacture the soul according to their own impious notions; 
<A NAME="297"></A>they affirm that which is the first cause of the generation and destruction 
<A NAME="298"></A>of all things, to be not first, but last, and that which is last to be 
<A NAME="299"></A>first, and hence they have fallen into error about the true nature of the 
<A NAME="300"></A>Gods.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Still I do not understand you.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Nearly all of them, my friends, seem to be ignorant of 
<A NAME="303"></A>the nature and power of the soul, especially in what relates to her origin: 
<A NAME="304"></A>they do not know that she is among the first of things, and before all 
<A NAME="305"></A>bodies, and is the chief author of their changes and transpositions. And 
<A NAME="306"></A>if this is true, and if the soul is older than the body, must not the things 
<A NAME="307"></A>which are of the soul's kindred be of necessity prior to those which appertain 
<A NAME="308"></A>to the body?
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then thought and attention and mind and art and law will 
<A NAME="311"></A>be prior to that which is hard and soft and heavy and light; and the great 
<A NAME="312"></A>and primitive works and actions will be works of art; they will be the 
<A NAME="313"></A>first, and after them will come nature and works of nature, which however 
<A NAME="314"></A>is a wrong term for men to apply to them; these will follow, and will be 
<A NAME="315"></A>under the government of art and mind.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> But why is the word "nature" wrong?
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Because those who use the term mean to say that nature 
<A NAME="318"></A>is the first creative power; but if the soul turn out to be the primeval 
<A NAME="319"></A>element, and not fire or air, then in the truest sense and beyond other 
<A NAME="320"></A>things the soul may be said to exist by nature; and this would be true 
<A NAME="321"></A>if you proved that the soul is older than the body, but not 
<A NAME="322"></A>otherwise.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> You are quite right.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Shall we, then, take this as the next point to which our 
<A NAME="325"></A>attention should be directed?
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us be on our guard lest this most deceptive argument 
<A NAME="328"></A>with its youthful looks, beguiling us old men, give us the slip and make 
<A NAME="329"></A>a laughing-stock of us. Who knows but we may be aiming at the greater, 
<A NAME="330"></A>and fail of attaining the lesser? Suppose that we three have to pass a 
<A NAME="331"></A>rapid river, and I, being the youngest of the three and experienced in 
<A NAME="332"></A>rivers, take upon me the duty of making the attempt first by myself; leaving 
<A NAME="333"></A>you in safety on the bank, I am to examine whether the river is passable 
<A NAME="334"></A>by older men like yourselves, and if such appears to be the case then I 
<A NAME="335"></A>shall invite you to follow, and my experience will help to convey you across; 
<A NAME="336"></A>but if the river is impassable by you, then there will have been no danger 
<A NAME="337"></A>to anybody but myself-would not that seem to be a very fair proposal? I 
<A NAME="338"></A>mean to say that the argument in prospect is likely to be too much for 
<A NAME="339"></A>you, out of your depth and beyond your strength, and I should be afraid 
<A NAME="340"></A>that the stream of my questions might create in you who are not in the 
<A NAME="341"></A>habit of answering, giddiness and confusion of mind, and hence a feeling 
<A NAME="342"></A>of unpleasantness and unsuitableness might arise. I think therefore that 
<A NAME="343"></A>I had better first ask the questions and then answer them myself while 
<A NAME="344"></A>you listen in safety; in that way I can carry on the argument until I have 
<A NAME="345"></A>completed the proof that the soul is prior to the body.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Excellent, Stranger, and I hope that you will do as 
<A NAME="347"></A>you propose.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Come, then, and if ever we are to call upon the Gods, 
<A NAME="349"></A>let us call upon them now in all seriousness to come to the demonstration 
<A NAME="350"></A>of their own existence. And so holding fast to the rope we will venture 
<A NAME="351"></A>upon the depths of the argument. When questions of this sort are asked 
<A NAME="352"></A>of me, my safest answer would appear to be as follows:-Some one says to 
<A NAME="353"></A>me, "O Stranger, are all things at rest and nothing in motion, or is the 
<A NAME="354"></A>exact opposite of this true, or are some things in motion and others at 
<A NAME="355"></A>rest?-To this I shall reply that some things are in motion and others at 
<A NAME="356"></A>rest. "And do not things which move a place, and are not the things which 
<A NAME="357"></A>are at rest at rest in a place?" Certainly. "And some move or rest in one 
<A NAME="358"></A>place and some in more places than one?" You mean to say, we shall rejoin, 
<A NAME="359"></A>that those things which rest at the centre move in one place, just as the 
<A NAME="360"></A>circumference goes round of globes which are said to be at rest? "Yes." 
<A NAME="361"></A>And we observe that, in the revolution, the motion which carries round 
<A NAME="362"></A>the larger and the lesser circle at the same time is proportionally distributed 
<A NAME="363"></A>to greater and smaller, and is greater and smaller in a certain proportion. 
<A NAME="364"></A>Here is a wonder which might be thought an impossibility, that the same 
<A NAME="365"></A>motion should impart swiftness and slowness in due proportion to larger 
<A NAME="366"></A>and lesser circles. "Very true." And when you speak of bodies moving in 
<A NAME="367"></A>many places, you seem to me to mean those which move from one place to 
<A NAME="368"></A>another, and sometimes have one centre of motion and sometimes more than 
<A NAME="369"></A>one because they turn upon their axis; and whenever they meet anything, 
<A NAME="370"></A>if it be stationary, they are divided by it; but if they get in the midst 
<A NAME="371"></A>between bodies which are approaching and moving towards the same spot from 
<A NAME="372"></A>opposite directions, they unite with them. "I admit the truth of what you 
<A NAME="373"></A>are saying." Also when they unite they grow, and when they are divided 
<A NAME="374"></A>they waste away-that is, supposing the constitution of each to remain, 
<A NAME="375"></A>or if that fails, then there is a second reason of their dissolution. "And 
<A NAME="376"></A>when are all things created and how?" Clearly, they are created when the 
<A NAME="377"></A>first principle receives increase and attains to the second dimension, 
<A NAME="378"></A>and from this arrives at the one which is neighbour to this, and after 
<A NAME="379"></A>reaching the third becomes perceptible to sense. Everything which is thus 
<A NAME="380"></A>changing and moving is in process of generation; only when at rest has 
<A NAME="381"></A>it real existence, but when passing into another state it is destroyed 
<A NAME="382"></A>utterly. Have we not mentioned all motions that there are, and comprehended 
<A NAME="383"></A>them under their kinds and numbered them with the exception, my friends, 
<A NAME="384"></A>of two?
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Which are they?
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Just the two, with which our present enquiry is 
<A NAME="387"></A>concerned.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Speak plainer.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I suppose that our enquiry has reference to the 
<A NAME="390"></A>soul?
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us assume that there is a motion able to move other 
<A NAME="393"></A>things, but not to move itself;-that is one kind; and there is another 
<A NAME="394"></A>kind which can move itself as well as other things, working in composition 
<A NAME="395"></A>and decomposition, by increase and diminution and generation and destruction-that 
<A NAME="396"></A>is also one of the many kinds of motion.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Granted.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And we will assume that which moves other, and is changed 
<A NAME="399"></A>by other, to be the ninth, and that which changes itself and others, and 
<A NAME="400"></A>is co-incident with every action and every passion, and is the true principle 
<A NAME="401"></A>of change and motion in all that is-that we shall be inclined to call the 
<A NAME="402"></A>tenth.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And which of these ten motions ought we to prefer as being 
<A NAME="405"></A>the mightiest and most efficient?
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I must say that the motion which is able to move itself 
<A NAME="407"></A>is ten thousand times superior to all the others.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Very good; but may I make one or two corrections in 
<A NAME="409"></A>what I have been saying?
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What are they?
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> When I spoke of the tenth sort of motion, that was not 
<A NAME="412"></A>quite correct.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What was the error?
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> According to the true order, the tenth was really the first 
<A NAME="415"></A>in generation and power; then follows the second, which was strangely enough 
<A NAME="416"></A>termed the ninth by us.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I mean this: when one thing changes another, and that another, 
<A NAME="419"></A>of such will there be any primary changing element? How can a thing which 
<A NAME="420"></A>is moved by another ever be the beginning of change? Impossible. But when 
<A NAME="421"></A>the self-moved changes other, and that again other, and thus thousands 
<A NAME="422"></A>upon tens of thousands of bodies are set in motion, must not the beginning 
<A NAME="423"></A>of all this motion be the change of the self-moving 
<A NAME="424"></A>principle?
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true, and I quite agree.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Or, to put the question in another way, making answer to 
<A NAME="427"></A>ourselves:-If, as most of these philosophers have the audacity to affirm, 
<A NAME="428"></A>all things were at rest in one mass, which of the above-mentioned principles 
<A NAME="429"></A>of motion would first spring up among them?
<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Clearly the self-moving; for there could be no change 
<A NAME="431"></A>in them arising out of any external cause; the change must first take place 
<A NAME="432"></A>in themselves.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then we must say that self-motion being the origin 
<A NAME="434"></A>of all motions, and the first which arises among things at rest as well 
<A NAME="435"></A>as among things in motion, is the eldest and mightiest principle of change, 
<A NAME="436"></A>and that which is changed by another and yet moves other is 
<A NAME="437"></A>second.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> At this stage of the argument let us put a 
<A NAME="440"></A>question.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> What question?
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> If we were to see this power existing in any earthy, watery, 
<A NAME="443"></A>or fiery substance, simple or compound-how should we describe 
<A NAME="444"></A>it?
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> You mean to ask whether we should call such a self-moving 
<A NAME="446"></A>power life?
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> I do.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly we should.
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And when we see soul in anything, must we not do the same-must 
<A NAME="450"></A>we not admit that this is life?
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> We must.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And now, I beseech you, reflect;-you would admit that we 
<A NAME="453"></A>have a threefold knowledge of things?
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I mean that we know the essence, and that we know the definition 
<A NAME="456"></A>of the essence, and the name,-these are the three; and there are two questions 
<A NAME="457"></A>which may be raised about anything.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How two?
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Sometimes a person may give the name and ask the definition; 
<A NAME="460"></A>or he may give the definition and ask the name. I may illustrate what I 
<A NAME="461"></A>mean in this way.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How?
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Number like some other things is capable of being divided 
<A NAME="464"></A>into equal parts; when thus divided, number is named "even," and the definition 
<A NAME="465"></A>of the name "even" is "number divisible into two equal 
<A NAME="466"></A>parts"?
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I mean, that when we are asked about the definition and 
<A NAME="469"></A>give the name, or when we are asked about the name and give the definition-in 
<A NAME="470"></A>either case, whether we give name or definition, we speak of the same thing, 
<A NAME="471"></A>calling "even" the number which is divided into two equal 
<A NAME="472"></A>parts.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And what is the definition of that which is named "soul"? 
<A NAME="475"></A>Can we conceive of any other than that which has been already given-the 
<A NAME="476"></A>motion which can move itself?
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> You mean to say that the essence which is defined as 
<A NAME="478"></A>the self-moved is the same with that which has the name 
<A NAME="479"></A>soul?
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes; and if this is true, do we still maintain that 
<A NAME="481"></A>there is anything wanting in the proof that the soul is the first origin 
<A NAME="482"></A>and moving power of all that is, or has become, or will be, and their contraries, 
<A NAME="483"></A>when she has been clearly shown to be the source of change and motion in 
<A NAME="484"></A>all things?
<A NAME="485"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly not; the soul as being the source of motion, 
<A NAME="486"></A>has been most satisfactorily shown to be the oldest of all 
<A NAME="487"></A>things.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> And is not that motion which is produced in another, 
<A NAME="489"></A>by reason of another, but never has any self-moving power at all, being 
<A NAME="490"></A>in truth the change of an inanimate body, to be reckoned second, or by 
<A NAME="491"></A>any lower number which you may prefer?
<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Exactly.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then we are right, and speak the most perfect and absolute 
<A NAME="494"></A>truth, when we say that the soul is prior to the body, and that the body 
<A NAME="495"></A>is second and comes afterwards, and is born to obey the soul, which is 
<A NAME="496"></A>the ruler?
<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Nothing can be more true.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Do you remember our old admission, that if the soul was 
<A NAME="499"></A>prior to the body the things of the soul were also prior to those of the 
<A NAME="500"></A>body?
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then characters and manners, and wishes and reasonings, 
<A NAME="503"></A>and true opinions, and reflections, and recollections are prior to length 
<A NAME="504"></A>and breadth and depth and strength of bodies, if the soul is prior to the 
<A NAME="505"></A>body.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In the next place, must we not of necessity admit that 
<A NAME="508"></A>the soul is the cause of good and evil, base and honourable, just and unjust, 
<A NAME="509"></A>and of all other opposites, if we suppose her to be the cause of all 
<A NAME="510"></A>things?
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> We must.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And as the soul orders and inhabits all things that move, 
<A NAME="513"></A>however moving, must we not say that she orders also the 
<A NAME="514"></A>heavens?
<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> One soul or more? More than one-I will answer for you; 
<A NAME="517"></A>at any rate, we must not suppose that there are less than two-one the author 
<A NAME="518"></A>of good, and the other of evil.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes, very true; the soul then directs all things in heaven, 
<A NAME="521"></A>and earth, and sea by her movements, and these are described by the terms-will, 
<A NAME="522"></A>consideration, attention, deliberation, opinion true and false, joy and 
<A NAME="523"></A>sorrow, confidence, fear, hatred, love, and other primary motions akin 
<A NAME="524"></A>to these; which again receive the secondary motions of corporeal substances, 
<A NAME="525"></A>and guide all things to growth and decay, to composition and decomposition, 
<A NAME="526"></A>and to the qualities which accompany them, such as heat and cold, heaviness 
<A NAME="527"></A>and lightness, hardness and softness, blackness and whiteness, bitterness 
<A NAME="528"></A>and sweetness, and all those other qualities which the soul uses, herself 
<A NAME="529"></A>a goddess, when truly receiving the divine mind she disciplines all things 
<A NAME="530"></A>rightly to their happiness; but when she is the companion of folly, she 
<A NAME="531"></A>does the very contrary of all this. Shall we assume so much, or do we still 
<A NAME="532"></A>entertain doubts?
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> There is no room at all for doubt.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Shall we say then that it is the soul which controls heaven 
<A NAME="535"></A>and earth, and the whole world?-that it is a principle of wisdom and virtue, 
<A NAME="536"></A>or a principle which has neither wisdom nor virtue? Suppose that we make 
<A NAME="537"></A>answer as follows:-
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How would you answer?
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> If, my friend, we say that the whole path and movement 
<A NAME="540"></A>of heaven, and of all that is therein, is by nature akin to the movement 
<A NAME="541"></A>and revolution and calculation of mind, and proceeds by kindred laws, then, 
<A NAME="542"></A>as is plain, we must say that the best soul takes care of the world and 
<A NAME="543"></A>guides it along the good path.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But if the world moves wildly and irregularly, then the 
<A NAME="546"></A>evil soul guides it.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True again.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Of what nature is the movement of mind?-To this question 
<A NAME="549"></A>it is not easy to give an intelligent answer; and therefore I ought to 
<A NAME="550"></A>assist you in framing one.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then let us not answer as if we would look straight at 
<A NAME="553"></A>the sun, making ourselves darkness at midday-I mean as if we were under 
<A NAME="554"></A>the impression that we could see with mortal eyes, or know adequately the 
<A NAME="555"></A>nature of mind;-it will be safer to look at the image 
<A NAME="556"></A>only.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us select of the ten motions the one which mind chiefly 
<A NAME="559"></A>resembles; this I will bring to your recollection, and will then make the 
<A NAME="560"></A>answer on behalf of us all.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That will be excellent.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> You will surely remember our saying that all things were 
<A NAME="563"></A>either at rest or in motion?
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I do.
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And that of things in motion some were moving in one place, 
<A NAME="566"></A>and others in more than one?
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Of these two kinds of motion, that which moves in one place 
<A NAME="569"></A>must move about a centre like globes made in a lathe, and is most entirely 
<A NAME="570"></A>akin and similar to the circular movement of mind.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="572"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In saying that both mind and the motion which is in one 
<A NAME="573"></A>place move in the same and like manner, in and about the same, and in relation 
<A NAME="574"></A>to the same, and according to one proportion and order, and are like the 
<A NAME="575"></A>motion of a globe, we invented a fair image, which does no discredit to 
<A NAME="576"></A>our ingenuity.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> It does us great credit.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And the motion of the other sort which is not after the 
<A NAME="579"></A>same manner, nor in the same, nor about the same, nor in relation to the 
<A NAME="580"></A>same, nor in one place, nor in order, nor according to any rule or proportion, 
<A NAME="581"></A>may be said to be akin to senselessness and folly?
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That is most true.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then, after what has been said, there is no difficulty 
<A NAME="584"></A>in distinctly stating, that since soul carries all things round, either 
<A NAME="585"></A>the best soul or the contrary must of necessity carry round and order and 
<A NAME="586"></A>arrange the revolution of the heaven.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> And judging from what has been said, Stranger, there 
<A NAME="588"></A>would be impiety in asserting that any but the most perfect soul or souls 
<A NAME="589"></A>carries round the heavens.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> You have understood my meaning right well, Cleinias, 
<A NAME="591"></A>and now let me ask you another question.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What are you going to ask?
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> If the soul carries round the sun and moon, and the other 
<A NAME="594"></A>stars, does she not carry round each individual of them?
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then of one of them let us speak, and the same argument 
<A NAME="597"></A>will apply to all.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Which will you take?
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Every one sees the body of the sun, but no one sees his 
<A NAME="600"></A>soul, nor the soul of any other body living or dead; and yet there is great 
<A NAME="601"></A>reason to believe that this nature, unperceived by any of our senses, is 
<A NAME="602"></A>circumfused around them all, but is perceived by mind; and therefore by 
<A NAME="603"></A>mind and reflection only let us apprehend the following 
<A NAME="604"></A>point.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What is that?
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> If the soul carries round the sun, we shall not be far 
<A NAME="607"></A>wrong in supposing one of three alternatives.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What are they?
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Either the soul which moves the sun this way and that, 
<A NAME="610"></A>resides within the circular and visible body, like the soul which carries 
<A NAME="611"></A>us about every way; or the soul provides herself with an external body 
<A NAME="612"></A>of fire or air, as some affirm, and violently propels body by body; or 
<A NAME="613"></A>thirdly, she is without such abody, but guides the sun by some extraordinary 
<A NAME="614"></A>and wonderful power.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes, certainly; the soul can only order all things 
<A NAME="616"></A>in one of these three ways.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> And this soul of the sun, which is therefore better 
<A NAME="618"></A>than the sun, whether taking the sun about in a chariot to give light to 
<A NAME="619"></A>men, or acting from without or in whatever way, ought by every man to be 
<A NAME="620"></A>deemed a God.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes, by every man who has the least particle of 
<A NAME="622"></A>sense.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And of the stars too, and of the moon, and of the years 
<A NAME="624"></A>and months and seasons, must we not say in like manner, that since a soul 
<A NAME="625"></A>or souls having every sort of excellence are the causes of all of them, 
<A NAME="626"></A>those souls are Gods, whether they are living beings and reside in bodies, 
<A NAME="627"></A>and in this way order the whole heaven, or whatever be the place and mode 
<A NAME="628"></A>of their existence;-and will any one who admits all this venture to deny 
<A NAME="629"></A>that all things full of Gods?
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> No one, Stranger, would be such a 
<A NAME="631"></A>madman.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And now, Megillus and Cleinias, let us offer terms to him 
<A NAME="633"></A>who has hitherto denied the existence of the Gods, and leave 
<A NAME="634"></A>him.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What terms?
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Either he shall teach us that we were wrong in saying that 
<A NAME="637"></A>the soul is the original of all things, and arguing accordingly; or, if 
<A NAME="638"></A>he be not able to say anything better, then he must yield to us and live 
<A NAME="639"></A>for the remainder of his life in the belief that there are Gods.-Let us 
<A NAME="640"></A>see, then, whether we have said enough or not enough to those who deny 
<A NAME="641"></A>that there are Gods.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly-quite enough, Stranger.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then to them we will say no more. And now we are to address 
<A NAME="644"></A>him who, believing that there are Gods, believes also that they take no 
<A NAME="645"></A>heed of human affairs: To him we say-O thou best of men, in believing that 
<A NAME="646"></A>there are Gods you are led by some affinity to them, which attracts you 
<A NAME="647"></A>towards your kindred and makes you honour and believe in them. But the 
<A NAME="648"></A>fortunes of evil and unrighteous men in private as well as public life, 
<A NAME="649"></A>which, though not really happy, are wrongly counted happy in the judgment 
<A NAME="650"></A>of men, and are celebrated both by poets and prose writers-these draw you 
<A NAME="651"></A>aside from your natural piety. Perhaps you have seen impious men growing 
<A NAME="652"></A>old and leaving their children's children in high offices, and their prosperity 
<A NAME="653"></A>shakes your faith-you have known or heard or been yourself an eyewitness 
<A NAME="654"></A>of many monstrous impieties, and have beheld men by such criminal means 
<A NAME="655"></A>from small beginnings attaining to sovereignty and the pinnacle of greatness; 
<A NAME="656"></A>and considering all these things you do not like to accuse the Gods of 
<A NAME="657"></A>them, because they are your relatives; and so from some want of reasoning 
<A NAME="658"></A>power, and also from an unwillingness to find fault with them, you have 
<A NAME="659"></A>come to believe that they exist indeed, but have no thought or care of 
<A NAME="660"></A>human things. Now, that your present evil opinion may not grow to still 
<A NAME="661"></A>greater impiety, and that we may if possible use arguments which may conjure 
<A NAME="662"></A>away the evil before it arrives, we will add another argument to that originally 
<A NAME="663"></A>addressed to him who utterly denied the existence of the Gods. And do you, 
<A NAME="664"></A>Megillus and Cleinias, answer for the young man as you did before; and 
<A NAME="665"></A>if any impediment comes in our way, I will take the word out of your mouths, 
<A NAME="666"></A>and carry you over the river as I did just now.
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very good; do as you say, and we will help you as well 
<A NAME="668"></A>as we can.
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> There will probably be no difficulty in proving to 
<A NAME="670"></A>him that the Gods care about the small as well as about the great. For 
<A NAME="671"></A>he was present and heard what was said, that they are perfectly good, and 
<A NAME="672"></A>that the care of all things is most entirely natural to 
<A NAME="673"></A>them.
<A NAME="674"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> No doubt he heard that.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us consider together in the next place what we mean 
<A NAME="676"></A>by this virtue which we ascribe to them. Surely we should say that to be 
<A NAME="677"></A>temperate and to possess mind belongs to virtue, and the contrary to 
<A NAME="678"></A>vice?
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="680"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Yes; and courage is a part of virtue, and cowardice of 
<A NAME="681"></A>vice?
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="683"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And the one is honourable, and the other 
<A NAME="684"></A>dishonourable?
<A NAME="685"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And the one, like other meaner things, is a human quality, 
<A NAME="687"></A>but the Gods have no part in anything of the sort?
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That again is what everybody will 
<A NAME="689"></A>admit.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But do we imagine carelessness and idleness and luxury 
<A NAME="691"></A>to be virtues? What do you think?
<A NAME="692"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Decidedly not.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> They rank under the opposite class?
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And their opposites, therefore, would fall under the opposite 
<A NAME="696"></A>class?
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But are we to suppose that one who possesses all these 
<A NAME="699"></A>good qualities will be luxurious and heedless and idle, like those whom 
<A NAME="700"></A>the poet compares to stingless drones?
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> And the comparison is a most just 
<A NAME="702"></A>one.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Surely God must not be supposed to have a nature which 
<A NAME="704"></A>he himself hates?-he who dares to say this sort of thing must not be tolerated 
<A NAME="705"></A>for a moment.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Of course not. How could he have?
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Should we not on any principle be entirely mistaken in 
<A NAME="708"></A>praising any one who has some special business entrusted to him, if he 
<A NAME="709"></A>have a mind which takes care of great matters and no care of small ones? 
<A NAME="710"></A>Reflect; he who acts in this way, whether he be God or man, must act from 
<A NAME="711"></A>one of two principles.
<A NAME="712"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What are they?
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Either he must think that the neglect of the small matters 
<A NAME="714"></A>is of no consequence to the whole, or if he knows that they are of consequence, 
<A NAME="715"></A>and he neglects them, his neglect must be attributed to carelessness and 
<A NAME="716"></A>indolence. Is there any other way in which his neglect can be explained? 
<A NAME="717"></A>For surely, when it is impossible for him to take care of all, he is not 
<A NAME="718"></A>negligent if he fails to attend to these things great or small, which a 
<A NAME="719"></A>God or some inferior being might be wanting in strength or capacity to 
<A NAME="720"></A>manage?
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Now, then, let us examine the offenders, who both alike 
<A NAME="723"></A>confess that there are Gods, but with a difference-the one saying that 
<A NAME="724"></A>they may be appeased, and the other that they have no care of small matters: 
<A NAME="725"></A>there are three of us and two of them, and we will say to them-In the first 
<A NAME="726"></A>place, you both acknowledge that the Gods hear and see and know all things, 
<A NAME="727"></A>and that nothing can escape them which is matter of sense and knowledge:-do 
<A NAME="728"></A>you admit this?
<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And do you admit also that they have all power which mortals 
<A NAME="731"></A>and immortals can have?
<A NAME="732"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> They will, of course, admit this 
<A NAME="733"></A>also.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And surely we three and they two-five in all-have acknowledged 
<A NAME="735"></A>that they are good and perfect?
<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Assuredly.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> But, if they are such as we conceive them to be, can we 
<A NAME="738"></A>possibly suppose that they ever act in the spirit of carelessness and indolence? 
<A NAME="739"></A>For in us inactivity is the child of cowardice, and carelessness of inactivity 
<A NAME="740"></A>and indolence.
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then not from inactivity and carelessness is any God ever 
<A NAME="743"></A>negligent; for there is no cowardice in them.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That is very true.
<A NAME="745"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then the alternative which remains is, that if the Gods 
<A NAME="746"></A>neglect the lighter and lesser concerns of the universe, they neglect them 
<A NAME="747"></A>because they know that they ought not to care about such matters-what other 
<A NAME="748"></A>alternative is there but the opposite of their knowing?
<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> There is none.
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And, O most excellent and best of men, do I understand 
<A NAME="751"></A>you to mean that they are careless because they are ignorant, and do not 
<A NAME="752"></A>know that they ought to take care, or that they know, and yet like the 
<A NAME="753"></A>meanest sort of men, knowing the better, choose the worse because they 
<A NAME="754"></A>are overcome by pleasures and pains?
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Impossible.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Do not all human things partake of the nature of soul? 
<A NAME="757"></A>And is not man the most religious of all animals?
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That is not to be denied.
<A NAME="759"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And we acknowledge that all mortal creatures are the property 
<A NAME="760"></A>of the Gods, to whom also the whole of heaven belongs?
<A NAME="761"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And, therefore, whether a person says that these things 
<A NAME="763"></A>are to the Gods great or small-in either case it would not be natural for 
<A NAME="764"></A>the Gods who own us, and who are the most careful and the best of owners 
<A NAME="765"></A>to neglect us.-There is also a further consideration.
<A NAME="766"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="767"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Sensation and power are in an inverse ratio to each other 
<A NAME="768"></A>in respect to their case and difficulty.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="770"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I mean that there is greater difficulty in seeing and hearing 
<A NAME="771"></A>the small than the great, but more facility in moving and controlling and 
<A NAME="772"></A>taking care of and unimportant things than of their 
<A NAME="773"></A>opposites.
<A NAME="774"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Far more.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Suppose the case of a physician who is willing and able 
<A NAME="776"></A>to cure some living thing as a whole-how will the whole fare at his hands 
<A NAME="777"></A>if he takes care only of the greater and neglects the parts which are 
<A NAME="778"></A>lesser?
<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Decidedly not well.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> No better would be the result with pilots or generals, 
<A NAME="781"></A>or householders or statesmen, or any other such class, if they neglected 
<A NAME="782"></A>the small and regarded only the great;-as the builders say, the larger 
<A NAME="783"></A>stones do not lie well without the lesser.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Of course not.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us not, then, deem God inferior to human workmen, who, 
<A NAME="786"></A>in proportion to their skill, finish and perfect their works, small as 
<A NAME="787"></A>well as great, by one and the same art; or that God, the wisest of beings, 
<A NAME="788"></A>who is both willing and able to take care, is like a lazy good-for-nothing, 
<A NAME="789"></A>or a coward, who turns his back upon labour and gives no thought to smaller 
<A NAME="790"></A>and easier matters, but to the greater only.
<A NAME="791"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Never, Stranger, let us admit a supposition about the 
<A NAME="792"></A>Gods which is both impious and false.
<A NAME="793"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> I think that we have now argued enough with him who 
<A NAME="794"></A>delights to accuse the Gods of neglect.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> He has been forced to acknowledge that he is in error, 
<A NAME="797"></A>but he still seems to me to need some words of consolation.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What consolation will you offer 
<A NAME="799"></A>him?
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us say to the youth:-The ruler of the universe has 
<A NAME="801"></A>ordered all things with a view to the excellence and preservation of the 
<A NAME="802"></A>whole, and each part, as far as may be, has an action and passion appropriate 
<A NAME="803"></A>to it. Over these, down to the least fraction of them, ministers have been 
<A NAME="804"></A>appointed to preside, who have wrought out their perfection with infinitesimal 
<A NAME="805"></A>exactness. And one of these portions of the universe is thine own, unhappy 
<A NAME="806"></A>man, which, however little, contributes to the whole; and you do not seem 
<A NAME="807"></A>to be aware that this and every other creation is for the sake of the whole, 
<A NAME="808"></A>and in order that the life of the whole may be blessed; and that you are 
<A NAME="809"></A>created for the sake of the whole, and not the whole for the sake of you. 
<A NAME="810"></A>For every physician and every skilled artist does all things for the sake 
<A NAME="811"></A>of the whole, directing his effort towards the common good, executing the 
<A NAME="812"></A>part for the sake of the whole, and not the whole for the sake of the part. 
<A NAME="813"></A>And you are annoyed because you are ignorant how what is best for you happens 
<A NAME="814"></A>to you and to the universe, as far as the laws of the common creation admit. 
<A NAME="815"></A>Now, as the soul combining first with one body and then with another undergoes 
<A NAME="816"></A>all sorts of changes, either of herself, or through the influence of another 
<A NAME="817"></A>soul, all that remains to the player of the game is that he should shift 
<A NAME="818"></A>the pieces; sending the better nature to the better place, and the worse 
<A NAME="819"></A>to the worse, and so assigning to them their proper 
<A NAME="820"></A>portion.
<A NAME="821"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> In what way do you mean?
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> In a way which may be supposed to make the care of all 
<A NAME="823"></A>things easy to the Gods. If any one were to form or fashion all things 
<A NAME="824"></A>without any regard to the whole-if, for example, he formed a living element 
<A NAME="825"></A>of water out of fire, instead of forming many things out of one or one 
<A NAME="826"></A>out of many in regular order attaining to a first or second or third birth, 
<A NAME="827"></A>the transmutation would have been infinite; but now the ruler of the world 
<A NAME="828"></A>has a wonderfully easy task.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How so?
<A NAME="830"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I will explain:-When the king saw that our actions had 
<A NAME="831"></A>life, and that there was much virtue in them and much vice, and that the 
<A NAME="832"></A>soul and body, although not, like the Gods of popular opinion, eternal, 
<A NAME="833"></A>yet having once come into existence, were indestructible (for if either 
<A NAME="834"></A>of them had been destroyed, there would have been no generation of living 
<A NAME="835"></A>beings); and when he observed that the good of the soul was ever by nature 
<A NAME="836"></A>designed to profit men, and the evil to harm them-he, seeing all this, 
<A NAME="837"></A>contrived so to place each of the parts that their position might in the 
<A NAME="838"></A>easiest and best manner procure the victory of good and the defeat of evil 
<A NAME="839"></A>in the whole. And he contrived a general plan by which a thing of a certain 
<A NAME="840"></A>nature found a certain seat and room. But the formation of qualities he 
<A NAME="841"></A>left to the wills of individuals. For every one of us is made pretty much 
<A NAME="842"></A>what he is by the bent of his desires and the nature of his 
<A NAME="843"></A>soul.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes, that is probably true.
<A NAME="845"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then all things which have a soul change, and possess in 
<A NAME="846"></A>themselves a principle of change, and in changing move according to law 
<A NAME="847"></A>and to the order of destiny: natures which have undergone a lesser change 
<A NAME="848"></A>move less and on the earth's surface, but those which have suffered more 
<A NAME="849"></A>change and have become more criminal sink into the abyss, that is to say, 
<A NAME="850"></A>into Hades and other places in the world below, of which the very names 
<A NAME="851"></A>terrify men, and which they picture to themselves as in a dream, both while 
<A NAME="852"></A>alive and when released from the body. And whenever the soul receives more 
<A NAME="853"></A>of good or evil from her own energy and the strong influence of others-when 
<A NAME="854"></A>she has communion with divine virtue and becomes divine, she is carried 
<A NAME="855"></A>into another and better place, which is perfect in holiness; but when she 
<A NAME="856"></A>has communion with evil, then she also changes the Place of her 
<A NAME="857"></A>life.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR>This is the justice of the Gods who inhabit Olympus. O youth or 
<A NAME="859"></A>young man, who fancy that you are neglected by the Gods, know that if you 
<A NAME="860"></A>become worse you shall go to the worse souls, or if better to the better, 
<A NAME="861"></A>and in every succession of life and death you will do and suffer what like 
<A NAME="862"></A>may fitly suffer at the hands of like. This is the justice of heaven, which 
<A NAME="863"></A>neither you nor any other unfortunate will ever glory in escaping, and 
<A NAME="864"></A>which the ordaining powers have specially ordained; take good heed thereof, 
<A NAME="865"></A>for it will be sure to take heed of you. If you say:-I am small and will 
<A NAME="866"></A>creep into the depths of the earth, or I am high and will fly up to heaven, 
<A NAME="867"></A>you are not so small or so high but that you shall pay the fitting penalty, 
<A NAME="868"></A>either here or in the world below or in some still more savage place whither 
<A NAME="869"></A>you shall be conveyed. This is also the explanation of the fate of those 
<A NAME="870"></A>whom you saw, who had done unholy and evil deeds, and from small beginnings 
<A NAME="871"></A>had grown great, and you fancied that from being miserable they had become 
<A NAME="872"></A>happy; and in their actions, as in a mirror, you seemed to see the universal 
<A NAME="873"></A>neglect of the Gods, not knowing how they make all things work together 
<A NAME="874"></A>and contribute to the great whole. And thinkest thou, bold man, that thou 
<A NAME="875"></A>needest not to know this?-he who knows it not can never form any true idea 
<A NAME="876"></A>of the happiness or unhappiness of life or hold any rational discourse 
<A NAME="877"></A>respecting either. If Cleinias and this our reverend company succeed in 
<A NAME="878"></A>bringing to you that you know not what you say of the Gods, then will God 
<A NAME="879"></A>help you; but should you desire to hear more, listen to what we say to 
<A NAME="880"></A>the third opponent, if you have any understanding whatsoever. For I think 
<A NAME="881"></A>that we have sufficiently proved the existence of the Gods, and that they 
<A NAME="882"></A>care for men:-The other notion that they are appeased by the wicked, and 
<A NAME="883"></A>take gifts, is what we must not concede to any one, and what every man 
<A NAME="884"></A>should disprove to the utmost of his power.
<A NAME="885"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very good; let us do as you say.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Well, then, by the Gods themselves I conjure you to tell 
<A NAME="887"></A>me-if they are to be propitiated, how are they to be propitiated? Who are 
<A NAME="888"></A>they, and what is their nature? Must they not be at least rulers who have 
<A NAME="889"></A>to order unceasingly the whole heaven?
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And to what earthly rulers can they be compared, or who 
<A NAME="892"></A>to them? How in the less can we find an image of the greater? Are they 
<A NAME="893"></A>charioteers of contending pairs of steeds, or pilots of vessels? Perhaps 
<A NAME="894"></A>they might be compared to the generals of armies, or they might be likened 
<A NAME="895"></A>to physicians providing against the diseases which make war upon the body, 
<A NAME="896"></A>or to husbandmen observing anxiously the effects of the seasons on the 
<A NAME="897"></A>growth of plants; or I perhaps, to shepherds of flocks. For as we acknowledge 
<A NAME="898"></A>the world to be full of many goods and also of evils, and of more evils 
<A NAME="899"></A>than goods, there is, as we affirm, an immortal conflict going on among 
<A NAME="900"></A>us, which requires marvellous watchfulness; and in that conflict the Gods 
<A NAME="901"></A>and demigods are our allies, and we are their property. Injustice and insolence 
<A NAME="902"></A>and folly are the destruction of us, and justice and temperance and wisdom 
<A NAME="903"></A>are our salvation; and the place of these latter is in the life of the 
<A NAME="904"></A>Gods, although some vestige of them may occasionally be discerned among 
<A NAME="905"></A>mankind. But upon this earth we know that there dwell souls possessing 
<A NAME="906"></A>an unjust spirit, who may be compared to brute animals, which fawn upon 
<A NAME="907"></A>their keepers, whether dogs or shepherds, or the best and most perfect 
<A NAME="908"></A>masters; for they in like manner, as the voices of the wicked declare, 
<A NAME="909"></A>prevail by flattery and prayers and incantations, and are allowed to make 
<A NAME="910"></A>their gains with impunity. And this sin, which is termed dishonesty, is 
<A NAME="911"></A>an evil of the same kind as what is termed disease in living bodies or 
<A NAME="912"></A>pestilence in years or seasons of the year, and in cities and governments 
<A NAME="913"></A>has another name, which is injustice.
<A NAME="914"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> What else can he say who declares that the Gods are always 
<A NAME="916"></A>lenient to the doers of unjust acts, if they divide the spoil with them? 
<A NAME="917"></A>As if wolves were to toss a portion of their prey to the dogs, and they, 
<A NAME="918"></A>mollified by the gift, suffered them to tear the flocks. Must not he who 
<A NAME="919"></A>maintains that the Gods can be propitiated argue thus?
<A NAME="920"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Precisely so.
<A NAME="921"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And to which of the above-mentioned classes of guardians 
<A NAME="922"></A>would any man compare the Gods without absurdity? Will he say that they 
<A NAME="923"></A>are like pilots, who are themselves turned away from their duty by "libations 
<A NAME="924"></A>of wine and the savour of fat," and at last overturn both ship and 
<A NAME="925"></A>sailors?
<A NAME="926"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Assuredly not.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And surely they are not like charioteers who are bribed 
<A NAME="928"></A>to give up the victory to other chariots?
<A NAME="929"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> That would be a fearful image of the 
<A NAME="930"></A>Gods.
<A NAME="931"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Nor are they like generals, or physicians, or husbandmen, 
<A NAME="932"></A>or shepherds; and no one would compare them to dogs who have silenced by 
<A NAME="933"></A>wolves.
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> A thing not to be spoken of.
<A NAME="935"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And are not all the Gods the chiefest of all guardians, 
<A NAME="936"></A>and do they not guard our highest interests?
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Yes; the chiefest.
<A NAME="938"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And shall we say that those who guard our noblest interests, 
<A NAME="939"></A>and are the best of guardians, are inferior in virtue to dogs, and to men 
<A NAME="940"></A>even of moderate excellence, who would never betray justice for the sake 
<A NAME="941"></A>of gifts which unjust men impiously offer them?
<A NAME="942"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Certainly not: nor is such a notion to be endured, 
<A NAME="943"></A>and he who holds this opinion may be fairly singled out and characterized 
<A NAME="944"></A>as of all impious men the wickedest and most impious.
<A NAME="945"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then are the three assertions-that the Gods exist, 
<A NAME="946"></A>and that they take care of men, and that they can never be persuaded to 
<A NAME="947"></A>do injustice, now sufficiently demonstrated? May we say that they 
<A NAME="948"></A>are?
<A NAME="949"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> You have our entire assent to your 
<A NAME="950"></A>words.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I have spoken with vehemence because I am zealous against 
<A NAME="952"></A>evil men; and I will tell dear Cleinias, why I am so. I would not have 
<A NAME="953"></A>the wicked think that, having the superiority in argument, they may do 
<A NAME="954"></A>as they please and act according to their various imaginations about the 
<A NAME="955"></A>Gods; and this zeal has led me to speak too vehemently; but if we have 
<A NAME="956"></A>at all succeeded in persuading the men to hate themselves and love their 
<A NAME="957"></A>opposites, the prelude of our laws about impiety will not have been spoken 
<A NAME="958"></A>in vain.
<A NAME="959"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> So let us hope; and even if we have failed, the style 
<A NAME="960"></A>of our argument will not discredit the lawgiver.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> After the prelude shall follow a discourse, which will 
<A NAME="962"></A>be the interpreter of the law; this shall proclaim to all impious persons:-that 
<A NAME="963"></A>they must depart from their ways and go over to the pious. And to those 
<A NAME="964"></A>who disobey, let the law about impiety be as follows:-If a man is guilty 
<A NAME="965"></A>of any impiety in word or deed, any one who happens to present shall give 
<A NAME="966"></A>information to the magistrates, in aid of the law; and let the magistrates 
<A NAME="967"></A>who. first receive the information bring him before the appointed court 
<A NAME="968"></A>according to the law; and if a magistrate, after receiving information, 
<A NAME="969"></A>refuses to act, he shall be tried for impiety at the instance of any one 
<A NAME="970"></A>who is willing to vindicate the laws; and if any one be cast, the court 
<A NAME="971"></A>shall estimate the punishment of each act of impiety; and let all such 
<A NAME="972"></A>criminals be imprisoned. There shall be three prisons in the state: the 
<A NAME="973"></A>first of them is to be the common prison in the neighbourhood of the agora 
<A NAME="974"></A>for the safe-keeping of the generality of offenders; another is to be in 
<A NAME="975"></A>the neighbourhood of the nocturnal council, and is to be called the "House 
<A NAME="976"></A>of Reformation"; another, to be situated in some wild and desolate region 
<A NAME="977"></A>in the centre of the country, shall be called by some name expressive of 
<A NAME="978"></A>retribution. Now, men fall into impiety from three causes, which have been 
<A NAME="979"></A>already mentioned, and from each of these causes arise two sorts of impiety, 
<A NAME="980"></A>in all six, which are worth distinguishing, and should not all have the 
<A NAME="981"></A>same punishment. For he who does not believe in Gods, and yet has a righteous 
<A NAME="982"></A>nature, hates the wicked and dislikes and refuses to do injustice, and 
<A NAME="983"></A>avoids unrighteous men, and loves the righteous. But they who besides believing 
<A NAME="984"></A>that the world is devoid of Gods are intemperate, and have at the same 
<A NAME="985"></A>time good memories and quick wits, are worse; although both of them are 
<A NAME="986"></A>unbelievers, much less injury is done by the one than by the other. The 
<A NAME="987"></A>one may talk loosely about the Gods and about sacrifices and oaths, and 
<A NAME="988"></A>perhaps by laughing at other men he may make them like himself, if he be 
<A NAME="989"></A>not punished. But the other who holds the same opinions and is called a 
<A NAME="990"></A>clever man, is full of stratagem and deceit-men of this class deal in prophecy 
<A NAME="991"></A>and jugglery of all kinds, and out of their ranks sometimes come tyrants 
<A NAME="992"></A>and demagogues and generals and hierophants of private mysteries and the 
<A NAME="993"></A>Sophists, as they are termed, with their ingenious devices. There are many 
<A NAME="994"></A>kinds of unbelievers, but two only for whom legislation is required; one 
<A NAME="995"></A>the hypocritical sort, whose crime is deserving of death many times over, 
<A NAME="996"></A>while the other needs only bonds and admonition. In like manner also the 
<A NAME="997"></A>notion that the Gods take no thought of men produces two other sorts of 
<A NAME="998"></A>crimes, and the notion that they may be propitiated produces two more. 
<A NAME="999"></A>Assuming these divisions, let those who have been made what they are only 
<A NAME="1000"></A>from want of understanding, and not from malice or an evil nature, be placed 
<A NAME="1001"></A>by the judge in the House of Reformation, and ordered to suffer imprisonment 
<A NAME="1002"></A>during a period of not less than five years. And in the meantime let them 
<A NAME="1003"></A>have no intercourse with the other citizens, except with members of the 
<A NAME="1004"></A>nocturnal council, and with them let them converse with a view to the improvement 
<A NAME="1005"></A>of their soul's health. And when the time of their imprisonment has expired, 
<A NAME="1006"></A>if any of them be of sound mind let him be restored to sane company, but 
<A NAME="1007"></A>if not, and if he be condemned a second time, let him be punished with 
<A NAME="1008"></A>death. As to that class of monstrous natures who not only believe that 
<A NAME="1009"></A>there are no Gods, or that they are negligent, or to be propitiated, but 
<A NAME="1010"></A>in contempt of mankind conjure the souls of the living and say that they 
<A NAME="1011"></A>can conjure the dead and promise to charm the Gods with sacrifices and 
<A NAME="1012"></A>prayers, and will utterly overthrow individuals and whole houses and states 
<A NAME="1013"></A>for the sake of money-let him who is guilty of any of these things be condemned 
<A NAME="1014"></A>by the court to be bound according to law in the prison which is in the 
<A NAME="1015"></A>centre of the land, and let no freeman ever approach him, but let him receive 
<A NAME="1016"></A>the rations of food appointed by the guardians of the law from the hands 
<A NAME="1017"></A>of the public slaves; and when he is dead let him be cast beyond the borders 
<A NAME="1018"></A>unburied, and if any freeman assist in burying him, let him pay the penalty 
<A NAME="1019"></A>of impiety to any one who is willing to bring a suit against him. But if 
<A NAME="1020"></A>he leaves behind him children who are fit to be citizens, let the guardians 
<A NAME="1021"></A>of orphans take care of them, just as they would of any other orphans, 
<A NAME="1022"></A>from the day on which their father is convicted.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR><BR>In all these cases there should be one law, which will make men 
<A NAME="1024"></A>in general less liable to transgress in word or deed, and less foolish, 
<A NAME="1025"></A>because they will not be allowed to practise religious rites contrary to 
<A NAME="1026"></A>law. And let this be the simple form of the law:-No man shall have sacred 
<A NAME="1027"></A>rites in a private house. When he would sacrifice, let him go to the temples 
<A NAME="1028"></A>and hand over his offerings to the priests and priestesses, who see to 
<A NAME="1029"></A>the sanctity of such things, and let him pray himself, and let any one 
<A NAME="1030"></A>who pleases join with him in prayer. The reason of this is as follows:-Gods 
<A NAME="1031"></A>and temples are not easily instituted, and to establish them rightly is 
<A NAME="1032"></A>the work of a mighty intellect. And women especially, and men too, when 
<A NAME="1033"></A>they are sick or in danger, or in any sort of difficulty, or again on their 
<A NAME="1034"></A>receiving any good fortune, have a way of consecrating the occasion, vowing 
<A NAME="1035"></A>sacrifices, and promising shrines to Gods, demigods, and sons of Gods; 
<A NAME="1036"></A>and when they are awakened by terrible apparitions and dreams or remember 
<A NAME="1037"></A>visions, they find in altars and temples the remedies of them, and will 
<A NAME="1038"></A>fill every house and village with them, placing them in the open air, or 
<A NAME="1039"></A>wherever they may have had such visions; and with a view to all these cases 
<A NAME="1040"></A>we should obey the law. The law has also regard to the impious, and would 
<A NAME="1041"></A>not have them fancy that by the secret performance of these actions-by 
<A NAME="1042"></A>raising temples and by building altars in private houses, they can propitiate 
<A NAME="1043"></A>the God secretly with sacrifices and prayers, while they are really multiplying 
<A NAME="1044"></A>their crimes infinitely, bringing guilt from heaven upon themselves, and 
<A NAME="1045"></A>also upon those who permit them, and who are better men than they are; 
<A NAME="1046"></A>and the consequence is that the whole state reaps the fruit of their impiety, 
<A NAME="1047"></A>which, in a certain sense, is deserved. Assuredly God will not blame the 
<A NAME="1048"></A>legislator, who will enact the following law:-No one shall possess shrines 
<A NAME="1049"></A>of the Gods in private houses, and he who is found to possess them, and 
<A NAME="1050"></A>perform any sacred rites not publicly authorized-supposing the offender 
<A NAME="1051"></A>to be some man or woman who is not guilty of any other great and impious 
<A NAME="1052"></A>crime-shall be informed against by him who is acquainted with the fact, 
<A NAME="1053"></A>which shall be announced by him to the guardians of the law; and let them 
<A NAME="1054"></A>issue orders that he or she shall carry away their private rites to the 
<A NAME="1055"></A>public temples, and if they do not persuade them, let them inflict a penalty 
<A NAME="1056"></A>on them until they comply. And if a person be proven guilty of impiety, 
<A NAME="1057"></A>not merely from childish levity, but such as grown-up men may be guilty 
<A NAME="1058"></A>of, whether he have sacrificed publicly or privately to any Gods, let him 
<A NAME="1059"></A>be punished with death, for his sacrifice is impure. Whether the deed has 
<A NAME="1060"></A>been done in earnest, or only from childish levity, let the guardians of 
<A NAME="1061"></A>the law determine, before they bring the matter into court and prosecute 
<A NAME="1062"></A>the offender for impiety.
