<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR><B>Socrates.</B> Observe, Protarchus, the nature of the position 
<A NAME="15"></A>which you are now going to take from Philebus, and what the other position 
<A NAME="16"></A>is which I maintain, and which, if you do not approve of it, is to be controverted 
<A NAME="17"></A>by you. Shall you and I sum up the two sides?
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR><B>Protarchus.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Philebus was saying that enjoyment and pleasure and 
<A NAME="20"></A>delight, and the class of feelings akin to them, are a good to every living 
<A NAME="21"></A>being, whereas I contend, that not these, but wisdom and intelligence and 
<A NAME="22"></A>memory, and their kindred, right opinion and true reasoning, are better 
<A NAME="23"></A>and more desirable than pleasure for all who are able to partake of them, 
<A NAME="24"></A>and that to all such who are or ever will be they are the most advantageous 
<A NAME="25"></A>of all things. Have I not given, Philebus, a fair statement of the two 
<A NAME="26"></A>sides of the argument?
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>Philebus Nothing could be fairer, Socrates.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And do you, the position which is assigned to 
<A NAME="29"></A>you?
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> I cannot do otherwise, since our excellent Philebus 
<A NAME="31"></A>has left the field.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Surely the truth about these matters ought, by all 
<A NAME="33"></A>means, to be ascertained.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Shall we further agree-
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> To what?
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That you and I must now try to indicate some state 
<A NAME="38"></A>and disposition of the soul, which has the property of making all men 
<A NAME="39"></A>happy.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes, by all means.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And you say that pleasure and I say that wisdom, is 
<A NAME="42"></A>such a state?
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> True.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And what if there be a third state, which is better 
<A NAME="45"></A>than either? Then both of us are vanquished-are we not? But if this life, 
<A NAME="46"></A>which really has the power of making men happy, turn out to be more akin 
<A NAME="47"></A>to pleasure than to wisdom, the life of pleasure may still have the advantage 
<A NAME="48"></A>over the life of wisdom.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> True.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Or suppose that the better life is more nearly allied 
<A NAME="51"></A>to wisdom, then wisdom conquers, and pleasure is defeated;-do you 
<A NAME="52"></A>agree?
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And what do you say, Philebus?
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR><B>Phi.</B> I say; and shall always say, that pleasure is easily 
<A NAME="56"></A>the conqueror; but you must decide for yourself, Protarchus.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> You, Philebus, have handed over the argument to me, 
<A NAME="58"></A>and have no longer a voice in the matter?
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR><B>Phi.</B> True enough. Nevertheless I would dear myself and deliver 
<A NAME="60"></A>my soul of you; and I call the goddess herself to witness that I now do 
<A NAME="61"></A>so.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> You may appeal to us; we too be the witnesses of your 
<A NAME="63"></A>words. And now, Socrates, whether Philebus is pleased or displeased, we 
<A NAME="64"></A>will proceed with the argument.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then let us begin with the goddess herself, of whom 
<A NAME="66"></A>Philebus says that she is called Aphrodite, but that her real name is 
<A NAME="67"></A>Pleasure.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The awe which I always feel, Protarchus, about the 
<A NAME="70"></A>names of the gods is more than human-it exceeds all other fears. And now 
<A NAME="71"></A>I would not sin against Aphrodite by naming her amiss; let her be called 
<A NAME="72"></A>what she pleases. But Pleasure I know to be manifold, and with her, as 
<A NAME="73"></A>I was just now saying, we must begin, and consider what her nature is. 
<A NAME="74"></A>She has one name, and therefore you would imagine that she is one; and 
<A NAME="75"></A>yet surely she takes the most varied and even unlike forms. For do we not 
<A NAME="76"></A>say that the intemperate has pleasure, and that the temperate has pleasure 
<A NAME="77"></A>in his very temperance-that the fool is pleased when he is full of foolish 
<A NAME="78"></A>fancies and hopes, and that the wise man has pleasure in his wisdom? and 
<A NAME="79"></A>how foolish would any one be who affirmed that all these opposite pleasures 
<A NAME="80"></A>are severally alike!
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Why, Socrates, they are opposed in so far as they spring 
<A NAME="82"></A>from opposite sources, but they are not in themselves opposite. For must 
<A NAME="83"></A>not pleasure be of all things most absolutely like pleasure-that is, like 
<A NAME="84"></A>himself?
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, my good friend, just as colour is like colour;-in 
<A NAME="86"></A>so far as colours are colours, there is no difference between them; and 
<A NAME="87"></A>yet we all know that black is not only unlike, but even absolutely opposed 
<A NAME="88"></A>to white: or again, as figure is like figure, for all figures are comprehended 
<A NAME="89"></A>under one class; and yet particular figures may be absolutely opposed to 
<A NAME="90"></A>one another, and there is an infinite diversity of them. And we might find 
<A NAME="91"></A>similar examples in many other things; therefore do not rely upon this 
<A NAME="92"></A>argument, which would go to prove the unity of the most extreme opposites. 
<A NAME="93"></A>And I suspect that we shall find a similar opposition among 
<A NAME="94"></A>pleasures.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Very likely; but how will this invalidate the 
<A NAME="96"></A>argument?
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why, I shall reply, that dissimilar as they are, you 
<A NAME="98"></A>apply to them a now predicate, for you say that all pleasant things are 
<A NAME="99"></A>good; now although no one can argue that pleasure is not pleasure, he may 
<A NAME="100"></A>argue, as we are doing, that pleasures are oftener bad than good; but you 
<A NAME="101"></A>call them all good, and at the same time are compelled, if you are pressed, 
<A NAME="102"></A>to acknowledge that they are unlike. And so you must tell us what is the 
<A NAME="103"></A>identical quality existing alike in good and bad pleasures, which makes. 
<A NAME="104"></A>you designate all of them as good.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What do you mean, Socrates? Do you think that any one 
<A NAME="106"></A>who asserts pleasure to be the good, will tolerate the notion that some 
<A NAME="107"></A>Pleasures are good and others bad?
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And yet you will acknowledge that they are different 
<A NAME="109"></A>from one another, and sometimes opposed?
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Not in so far as they are pleasures.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That is a return to the old position, Protarchus, and 
<A NAME="112"></A>so we are to say (are we?) that there is no difference in pleasures, but 
<A NAME="113"></A>that they are all alike; and the examples which have just been cited do 
<A NAME="114"></A>not pierce our dull minds, but we go on arguing all the same, like the 
<A NAME="115"></A>weakest and most inexperienced reasoners?
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why, I mean to say, that in self-defence I may, if 
<A NAME="118"></A>I like, follow your example, and assert boldly that the two things most 
<A NAME="119"></A>unlike are most absolutely alike; and the result will be that you and I 
<A NAME="120"></A>will prove ourselves to be very tyros in the art of disputing; and the 
<A NAME="121"></A>argument will be blown away and lost. Suppose that we put back, and return 
<A NAME="122"></A>to the old position; then perhaps we may come to an understanding with 
<A NAME="123"></A>one another.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> How do you mean?
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Shall I, Protarchus, have my own question asked of 
<A NAME="126"></A>me by you?
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What question?
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Ask me whether wisdom and science and mind, and those 
<A NAME="129"></A>other qualities which I, when asked by you at first what is the nature 
<A NAME="130"></A>of the good, affirmed to be good, are not in the same case with the pleasures 
<A NAME="131"></A>of which you spoke.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The sciences are a numerous class, and will be found 
<A NAME="134"></A>to present great differences. But even admitting that, like the pleasures, 
<A NAME="135"></A>they are opposite as well as different, should I be worthy of the name 
<A NAME="136"></A>of dialectician if, in order to avoid this difficulty, I were to say (as 
<A NAME="137"></A>you are saying of pleasure) that there is no difference between one science 
<A NAME="138"></A>and another;-would not the argument founder and disappear like an idle 
<A NAME="139"></A>tale, although we might ourselves escape drowning by clinging to a 
<A NAME="140"></A>fallacy?
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> May none of this befall us, except the deliverance! 
<A NAME="142"></A>Yet I like the even-handed justice which is applied to both our arguments. 
<A NAME="143"></A>Let us assume, then, that there are many and diverse pleasures, and many 
<A NAME="144"></A>and different sciences.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And let us have no concealment, Protarchus, of the 
<A NAME="146"></A>differences between my good and yours; but let us bring them to the light 
<A NAME="147"></A>in the hope that, in the process of testing them, they may show whether 
<A NAME="148"></A>pleasure is to be called the good, or wisdom, or some third quality; for 
<A NAME="149"></A>surely we are not now simply contending in order that my view or that yours 
<A NAME="150"></A>may prevail, but I presume that we ought both of us to be fighting for 
<A NAME="151"></A>the truth.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly we ought.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then let us have a more definite understanding and 
<A NAME="154"></A>establish the principle on which the argument rests.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What principle?
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> A principle about which all men are always in a difficulty, 
<A NAME="157"></A>and some men sometimes against their will.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Speak plainer.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The principle which has just turned up, which is a 
<A NAME="160"></A>marvel of nature; for that one should be many or many one, are wonderful 
<A NAME="161"></A>propositions; and he who affirms either is very open to 
<A NAME="162"></A>attack.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Do you mean, when a person says that I, Protarchus, 
<A NAME="164"></A>am by nature one and also many, dividing the single "me" into many "mens," 
<A NAME="165"></A>and even opposing them as great and small, light and heavy, and in ten 
<A NAME="166"></A>thousand other ways?
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Those, Protarchus, are the common and acknowledged 
<A NAME="168"></A>paradoxes about the one and many, which I may say that everybody has by 
<A NAME="169"></A>this time agreed to dismiss as childish and obvious and detrimental to 
<A NAME="170"></A>the true course of thought; and no more favour is shown to that other puzzle, 
<A NAME="171"></A>in which a person proves the members and parts of anything to be divided, 
<A NAME="172"></A>and then confessing that they are all one, says laughingly in disproof 
<A NAME="173"></A>of his own words: Why, here is a miracle, the one is many and infinite, 
<A NAME="174"></A>and the many are only one.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> But what, Socrates, are those other marvels connected 
<A NAME="176"></A>with this subject which, as you imply, have not yet become common and 
<A NAME="177"></A>acknowledged?
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> When, my boy, the one does not belong to the class 
<A NAME="179"></A>of things that are born and perish, as in the instances which we were giving, 
<A NAME="180"></A>for in those cases, and when unity is of this concrete nature, there is, 
<A NAME="181"></A>as I was saying, a universal consent that no refutation is needed; but 
<A NAME="182"></A>when the assertion is made that man is one, or ox is one, or beauty one, 
<A NAME="183"></A>or the good one, then the interest which attaches to these and similar 
<A NAME="184"></A>unities and the attempt which is made to divide them gives birth to a 
<A NAME="185"></A>controversy.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Of what nature?
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> In the first place, as to whether these unities have 
<A NAME="188"></A>a real existence; and then how each individual unity, being always the 
<A NAME="189"></A>same, and incapable either of generation of destruction, but retaining 
<A NAME="190"></A>a permanent individuality, can be conceived either as dispersed and multiplied 
<A NAME="191"></A>in the infinity of the world of generation, or as still entire and yet 
<A NAME="192"></A>divided from itself, which latter would seem to be the greatest impossibility 
<A NAME="193"></A>of all, for how can one and the same thing be at the same time in one and 
<A NAME="194"></A>in many things? These, Protarchus, are the real difficulties, and this 
<A NAME="195"></A>is the one and many to which they relate; they are the source of great 
<A NAME="196"></A>perplexity if ill decided, and the right determination of them is very 
<A NAME="197"></A>helpful.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Then, Socrates, let us begin by clearing up these 
<A NAME="199"></A>questions.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That is what I should wish.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> And I am sure that all my other friends will be glad 
<A NAME="202"></A>to hear them discussed; Philebus, fortunately for us, is not disposed to 
<A NAME="203"></A>move, and we had better not stir him up with questions.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Good; and where shall we begin this great and multifarious 
<A NAME="205"></A>battle, in which such various points are at issue? Shall begin 
<A NAME="206"></A>thus?
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> How?
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> We say that the one and many become identified by thought, 
<A NAME="209"></A>and that now, as in time past, they run about together, in and out of every 
<A NAME="210"></A>word which is uttered, and that this union of them will never cease, and 
<A NAME="211"></A>is not now beginning, but is, as I believe, an everlasting quality of thought 
<A NAME="212"></A>itself, which never grows old. Any young man, when he first tastes these 
<A NAME="213"></A>subtleties, is delighted, and fancies that he has found a treasure of wisdom; 
<A NAME="214"></A>in the first enthusiasm of his joy he leaves no stone, or rather no thought 
<A NAME="215"></A>unturned, now rolling up the many into the one, and kneading them together, 
<A NAME="216"></A>now unfolding and dividing them; he puzzles himself first and above all, 
<A NAME="217"></A>and then he proceeds to puzzle his neighbours, whether they are older or 
<A NAME="218"></A>younger, or of his own age-that makes no difference; neither father nor 
<A NAME="219"></A>mother does he spare; no human being who has ears is safe from him, hardly 
<A NAME="220"></A>even his dog, and a barbarian would have no chance of escaping him, if 
<A NAME="221"></A>an interpreter could only be found.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Considering, Socrates, how many we are, and that all 
<A NAME="223"></A>of us are young men, is there not a danger that we and Philebus may all 
<A NAME="224"></A>set upon you, if you abuse us? We understand what you mean; but is there 
<A NAME="225"></A>no charm by which we may dispel all this confusion, no more excellent way 
<A NAME="226"></A>of arriving at the truth? If there is, we hope that you will guide us into 
<A NAME="227"></A>that way, and we will do our best to follow, for the enquiry in which we 
<A NAME="228"></A>are engaged, Socrates, is not unimportant.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The reverse of unimportant, my boys, as Philebus calls 
<A NAME="230"></A>you, and there neither is nor ever will be a better than my own favourite 
<A NAME="231"></A>way, which has nevertheless already often deserted me and left me helpless 
<A NAME="232"></A>in the hour of need.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Tell us what that is.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> One which may be easily pointed out, but is by no means 
<A NAME="235"></A>easy of application; it is the parent of all the discoveries in the 
<A NAME="236"></A>arts.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Tell us what it is.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> A gift of heaven, which, as I conceive, the gods tossed 
<A NAME="239"></A>among men by the hands of a new Prometheus, and therewith a blaze of light; 
<A NAME="240"></A>and the ancients, who were our betters and nearer the gods than we are, 
<A NAME="241"></A>handed down the tradition, that whatever things are said to be are composed 
<A NAME="242"></A>of one and many, and have the finite, and infinite implanted in them: seeing, 
<A NAME="243"></A>then, that such is the order of the world, we too ought in every enquiry 
<A NAME="244"></A>to begin by laying down one idea of that which is the subject of enquiry; 
<A NAME="245"></A>this unity we shall find in everything. Having found it, we may next proceed 
<A NAME="246"></A>to look for two, if there be two, or, if not, then for three or some other 
<A NAME="247"></A>number, subdividing each of these units, until at last the unity with which 
<A NAME="248"></A>we began is seen not only to be one and many and infinite, but also a definite 
<A NAME="249"></A>number; the infinite must not be suffered to approach the many until the 
<A NAME="250"></A>entire number of the species intermediate between unity and infinity has 
<A NAME="251"></A>been discovered-then, and not till then, we may, rest from division, and 
<A NAME="252"></A>without further troubling ourselves about the endless individuals may allow 
<A NAME="253"></A>them to drop into infinity. This, as I was saying, is the way of considering 
<A NAME="254"></A>and learning and teaching one another, which the gods have handed down 
<A NAME="255"></A>to us. But the wise men of our time are either too quick or too slow, in 
<A NAME="256"></A>conceiving plurality in unity. Having no method, they make their one and 
<A NAME="257"></A>many anyhow, and from unity pass at once to infinity; the intermediate 
<A NAME="258"></A>steps never occur to them. And this, I repeat, is what makes the difference 
<A NAME="259"></A>between the mere art of disputation and true dialectic.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> I think that I partly understand you Socrates, but 
<A NAME="261"></A>I should like to have a clearer notion of what you are 
<A NAME="262"></A>saying.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I may illustrate my meaning by the letters of the alphabet, 
<A NAME="264"></A>Protarchus, which you were made to learn as a child.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> How do they afford an illustration?
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The sound which passes through the lips whether of 
<A NAME="267"></A>an individual or of all men is one and yet infinite.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And yet not by knowing either that sound is one or 
<A NAME="270"></A>that sound is infinite are we perfect in the art of speech, but the knowledge 
<A NAME="271"></A>of the number and nature of sounds is what makes a man a 
<A NAME="272"></A>grammarian.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the knowledge which makes a man a musician is of 
<A NAME="275"></A>the same kind.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> How so?
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Sound is one in music as well as in 
<A NAME="278"></A>grammar?
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And there is a higher note and a lower note, and a 
<A NAME="281"></A>note of equal pitch:-may we affirm so much?
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But you would not be a real musician if this was all 
<A NAME="284"></A>that you knew; though if you did not know this you would know almost nothing 
<A NAME="285"></A>of music.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Nothing.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But when you have learned what sounds are high and 
<A NAME="288"></A>what low, and the number and nature of the intervals and their limits or 
<A NAME="289"></A>proportions, and the systems compounded out of them, which our fathers 
<A NAME="290"></A>discovered, and have handed down to us who are their descendants under 
<A NAME="291"></A>the name of harmonies; and the affections corresponding to them in the 
<A NAME="292"></A>movements of the human body, which when measured by numbers ought, as they 
<A NAME="293"></A>say, to be called rhythms and measures; and they tell us that the same 
<A NAME="294"></A>principle should be applied to every one and many;-when, I say, you have 
<A NAME="295"></A>learned all this, then, my dear friend, you are perfect; and you may be 
<A NAME="296"></A>said to understand any other subject, when you have a similar grasp of 
<A NAME="297"></A>it. But the, infinity of kinds and the infinity of individuals which there 
<A NAME="298"></A>is in each of them, when not classified, creates in every one of us a state 
<A NAME="299"></A>of infinite ignorance; and he who never looks for number in anything, will 
<A NAME="300"></A>not himself be looked for in the number of famous men.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> I think that what Socrates is now saying is excellent, 
<A NAME="302"></A>Philebus.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR><B>Phi.</B> I think so too, but how do his words bear upon us and 
<A NAME="304"></A>upon the argument?
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Philebus is right in asking that question of us, 
<A NAME="306"></A>Protarchus.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Indeed he is, and you must answer 
<A NAME="308"></A>him.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I will; but you must let me make one little remark 
<A NAME="310"></A>first about these matters; I was saying, that he who begins with any individual 
<A NAME="311"></A>unity, should proceed from that, not to infinity, but to a definite number, 
<A NAME="312"></A>and now I say conversely, that he who has to begin with infinity should 
<A NAME="313"></A>not jump to unity, but he should look about for some number, representing 
<A NAME="314"></A>a certain quantity, and thus out of all end in one. And now let us return 
<A NAME="315"></A>for an illustration of our principle to the case of 
<A NAME="316"></A>letters.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Some god or divine man, who in the Egyptian legend 
<A NAME="319"></A>is said to have been Theuth, observing that the human voice was infinite, 
<A NAME="320"></A>first distinguished in this infinity a certain number of vowels, and then 
<A NAME="321"></A>other letters which had sound, but were not pure vowels (i.e., the semivowels); 
<A NAME="322"></A>these too exist in a definite number; and lastly, he distinguished a third 
<A NAME="323"></A>class of letters which we now call mutes, without voice and without sound, 
<A NAME="324"></A>and divided these, and likewise the two other classes of vowels and semivowels, 
<A NAME="325"></A>into the individual sounds, told the number of them, and gave to each and 
<A NAME="326"></A>all of them the name of letters; and observing that none of us could learn 
<A NAME="327"></A>any one of them and not learn them all, and in consideration of this common 
<A NAME="328"></A>bond which in a manner united them, he assigned to them all a single art, 
<A NAME="329"></A>and this he called the art of grammar or letters.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR><B>Phi.</B> The illustration, Protarchus, has assisted me in understanding 
<A NAME="331"></A>the original statement, but I still feel the defect of which I just now 
<A NAME="332"></A>complained.
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Are you going to ask, Philebus, what this has to do 
<A NAME="334"></A>with the argument?
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR><B>Phi.</B> Yes, that is a question which Protarchus and I have 
<A NAME="336"></A>been long asking.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Assuredly you have already arrived at the answer to 
<A NAME="338"></A>the question which, as you say, you have been so long 
<A NAME="339"></A>asking?
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR><B>Phi.</B> How so?
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Did we not begin by enquiring into the comparative 
<A NAME="342"></A>eligibility of pleasure and wisdom?
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR><B>Phi.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And we maintain that they are each of them 
<A NAME="345"></A>one?
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR><B>Phi.</B> True.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the precise question to which the previous discussion 
<A NAME="348"></A>desires an answer is, how they are one and also many [i.e., how they have 
<A NAME="349"></A>one genus and many species], and are not at once infinite, and what number 
<A NAME="350"></A>of species is to be assigned to either of them before they pass into 
<A NAME="351"></A>infinity.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> That is a very serious question, Philebus, to which 
<A NAME="353"></A>Socrates has ingeniously brought us round, and please to consider which 
<A NAME="354"></A>of us shall answer him; there may be something ridiculous in my being unable 
<A NAME="355"></A>to answer, and therefore imposing the task upon you, when I have undertaken 
<A NAME="356"></A>the whole charge of the argument, but if neither of us were able to answer, 
<A NAME="357"></A>the result methinks would be still more ridiculous. Let us consider, then, 
<A NAME="358"></A>what we are to do:-Socrates, if I understood him rightly, is asking whether 
<A NAME="359"></A>there are not kinds of pleasure, and what is the number and nature of them, 
<A NAME="360"></A>and the same of wisdom.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Most true, O son of Callias; and the previous argument 
<A NAME="362"></A>showed that if we are not able to tell the kinds of everything that has 
<A NAME="363"></A>unity, likeness, sameness, or their opposites, none of us will be of the 
<A NAME="364"></A>smallest use in any enquiry.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> That seems to be very near the truth, Socrates. Happy 
<A NAME="366"></A>would the wise man be if he knew all things, and the next best thing for 
<A NAME="367"></A>him is that he should know himself. Why do I say so at this moment? I will 
<A NAME="368"></A>tell you. You, Socrates, have granted us this opportunity of conversing 
<A NAME="369"></A>with you, and are ready to assist us in determining what is the best of 
<A NAME="370"></A>human goods. For when Philebus said that pleasure and delight and enjoyment 
<A NAME="371"></A>and the like were the chief good, you answered-No, not those, but another 
<A NAME="372"></A>class of goods; and we are constantly reminding ourselves of what you said, 
<A NAME="373"></A>and very properly, in order that we may not forget to examine and compare 
<A NAME="374"></A>the two. And these goods, which in your opinion are to be designated as 
<A NAME="375"></A>superior to pleasure, and are the true objects of pursuit, are mind and 
<A NAME="376"></A>knowledge and understanding and art and the like. There was a dispute about 
<A NAME="377"></A>which were the best, and we playfully threatened that you should not be 
<A NAME="378"></A>allowed to go home until the question was settled; and you agreed, and 
<A NAME="379"></A>placed yourself at our disposal. And now, as children say, what has been 
<A NAME="380"></A>fairly given cannot be taken back; cease then to fight against us in this 
<A NAME="381"></A>way.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> In what way?
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR><B>Phi.</B> Do not perplex us, and keep asking questions of us 
<A NAME="384"></A>to which we have not as yet any sufficient answer to give; let us not imagine 
<A NAME="385"></A>that a general puzzling of us all is to be the end of our discussion, but 
<A NAME="386"></A>if we are unable to answer, do you answer, as you have promised. Consider, 
<A NAME="387"></A>then, whether you will divide pleasure and knowledge according to their 
<A NAME="388"></A>kinds; or you may let the matter drop, if you are able and willing to find 
<A NAME="389"></A>some other mode of clearing up our controversy.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> If you say that, I have nothing to apprehend, for the 
<A NAME="391"></A>words "if you are willing" dispel all my fear; and, moreover, a god seems 
<A NAME="392"></A>to have recalled something to my mind.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR><B>Phi.</B> What is that?
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I remember to have heard long ago certain discussions 
<A NAME="395"></A>about pleasure and wisdom, whether awake or in a dream I cannot tell; they 
<A NAME="396"></A>were to the effect that neither the one nor the other of them was the good, 
<A NAME="397"></A>but some third thing, which was different from them, and better than either. 
<A NAME="398"></A>If this be clearly established, then pleasure will lose the victory, for 
<A NAME="399"></A>the good will cease to be identified with her:-Am I not 
<A NAME="400"></A>right?
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And there will cease to be any need of distinguishing 
<A NAME="403"></A>the kinds of pleasures, as I am inclined to think, but this will appear 
<A NAME="404"></A>more clearly as we proceed.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Capital, Socrates; pray go on as you 
<A NAME="406"></A>propose.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But, let us first agree on some little 
<A NAME="408"></A>points.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What are they?
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Is the good perfect or imperfect?
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> The most perfect, Socrates, of all 
<A NAME="412"></A>things.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is the good sufficient?
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes, certainly, and in a degree surpassing all other 
<A NAME="415"></A>things.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And no one can deny that all percipient beings desire 
<A NAME="417"></A>and hunt after good, and are eager to catch and have the good about them, 
<A NAME="418"></A>and care not for the attainment of anything which its not accompanied by 
<A NAME="419"></A>good.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> That is undeniable.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Now let us part off the life of pleasure from the life 
<A NAME="422"></A>of wisdom, and pass them in review.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> How do you mean?
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let there be no wisdom in the life of pleasure, nor 
<A NAME="425"></A>any pleasure in the life of wisdom, for if either of them is the chief 
<A NAME="426"></A>good, it cannot be supposed to want anything, but if either is shown to 
<A NAME="427"></A>want anything, then it cannot really be the chief good.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Impossible.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And will you help us to test these two 
<A NAME="430"></A>lives?
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then answer.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Ask.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Would you choose, Protarchus, to live all your life 
<A NAME="435"></A>long in the enjoyment of the greatest pleasures?
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly I should.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Would you consider that there was still anything wanting 
<A NAME="438"></A>to you if you had perfect pleasure?
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Reflect; would you not want wisdom and intelligence 
<A NAME="441"></A>and forethought, and similar qualities? would you not at any rate want 
<A NAME="442"></A>sight?
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Why should I? Having pleasure I should have all 
<A NAME="444"></A>things.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Living thus, you would always throughout your life 
<A NAME="446"></A>enjoy the greatest pleasures?
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> I should.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But if you had neither mind, nor memory, nor knowledge, 
<A NAME="449"></A>nor true opinion, you would in the first place be utterly ignorant of whether 
<A NAME="450"></A>you were pleased or not, because you would be entirely devoid of 
<A NAME="451"></A>intelligence.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And similarly, if you had no memory you would not recollect 
<A NAME="454"></A>that you had ever been pleased, nor would the slightest recollection of 
<A NAME="455"></A>the pleasure which you feel at any moment remain with you; and if you had 
<A NAME="456"></A>no true opinion you would not think that you were pleased when you were; 
<A NAME="457"></A>and if you had no power of calculation you would not be able to calculate 
<A NAME="458"></A>on future pleasure, and your life would be the life, not of a man, but 
<A NAME="459"></A>of an oyster or pulmo marinus. Could this be otherwise?
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> No.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But is such a life eligible?
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> I cannot answer you, Socrates; the argument has taken 
<A NAME="463"></A>away from me the power of speech.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> We must keep up our spirits;-let us now take the life 
<A NAME="465"></A>of mind and examine it in turn.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> And what is this life of mind?
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I want to know whether any one of us would consent 
<A NAME="468"></A>to live, having wisdom and mind and knowledge and memory of all things, 
<A NAME="469"></A>but having no sense of pleasure or pain, and wholly unaffected by these 
<A NAME="470"></A>and the like feelings?
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Neither life, Socrates, appears eligible to me, or 
<A NAME="472"></A>is likely, as I should imagine, to be chosen by any one 
<A NAME="473"></A>else.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What would you say, Protarchus, to both of these in 
<A NAME="475"></A>one, or to one that was made out of the union of the 
<A NAME="476"></A>two?
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Out of the union, that is, of pleasure with mind and 
<A NAME="478"></A>wisdom?
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, that is the life which I mean.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> There can be no difference of opinion; not some but 
<A NAME="481"></A>all would surely choose this third rather than either of the other two, 
<A NAME="482"></A>and in addition to them.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But do you see the consequence?
<A NAME="484"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> To be sure I do. The consequence is, that two out of 
<A NAME="485"></A>the three lives which have been proposed are neither sufficient nor eligible 
<A NAME="486"></A>for man or for animal.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then now there can be no doubt that neither of them 
<A NAME="488"></A>has the good, for the one which had would certainly have been sufficient 
<A NAME="489"></A>and perfect and eligible for every living creature or thing that was able 
<A NAME="490"></A>to live such a life; and if any of us had chosen any other, he would have 
<A NAME="491"></A>chosen contrary to the nature of the truly eligible, and not of his own 
<A NAME="492"></A>free will, but either through ignorance or from some unhappy 
<A NAME="493"></A>necessity.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly that seems to be true.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And now have I not sufficiently shown that Philebus, 
<A NAME="496"></A>goddess is not to be regarded as identical with the 
<A NAME="497"></A>good?
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><BR><B>Phi.</B> Neither is your "mind" the good, Socrates, for that 
<A NAME="499"></A>will be open to the same objections.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Perhaps, Philebus, you may be right in saying so of 
<A NAME="501"></A>my "mind"; but of the true, which is also the divine mind, far otherwise. 
<A NAME="502"></A>However, I will not at present claim the first place for mind as against 
<A NAME="503"></A>the mixed life; but we must come to some understanding about the second 
<A NAME="504"></A>place. For you might affirm pleasure and I mind to be the cause of the 
<A NAME="505"></A>mixed life; and in that case although neither of them would be the good, 
<A NAME="506"></A>one of them might be imagined to be the cause of the good. And I might 
<A NAME="507"></A>proceed further to argue in opposition to Phoebus, that the element which 
<A NAME="508"></A>makes this mixed life eligible and good, is more akin and more similar 
<A NAME="509"></A>to mind than to pleasure. And if this is true, pleasure cannot be truly 
<A NAME="510"></A>said to share either in the first or second place, and does not, if I may 
<A NAME="511"></A>trust my own mind, attain even to the third.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Truly, Socrates, pleasure appears to me to have had 
<A NAME="513"></A>a fall; in fighting for the palm, she has been smitten by the argument, 
<A NAME="514"></A>and is laid low. I must say that mind would have fallen too, and may therefore 
<A NAME="515"></A>be thought to show discretion in not putting forward a similar claim. And 
<A NAME="516"></A>if pleasure were deprived not only of the first but of the second place, 
<A NAME="517"></A>she would be terribly damaged in the eyes of her admirers, for not even 
<A NAME="518"></A>to them would she still appear as fair as before.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, but had we not better leave her now, and not 
<A NAME="520"></A>pain her by applying the crucial test, and finally detecting 
<A NAME="521"></A>her?
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Nonsense, Socrates.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why? because I said that we had better not pain pleasure, 
<A NAME="524"></A>which is an impossibility?
<A NAME="525"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes, and more than that, because you do not seem to 
<A NAME="526"></A>be aware that none of us will let you go home until you have finished the 
<A NAME="527"></A>argument.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Heavens! Protarchus, that will be a tedious business, 
<A NAME="529"></A>and just at present not at all an easy one. For in going to war in the 
<A NAME="530"></A>cause of mind, who is aspiring to the second prize, I ought to have weapons 
<A NAME="531"></A>of another make from those which I used before; some, however, of the old 
<A NAME="532"></A>ones may do again. And must I then finish the argument?
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Of course you must.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let us be very careful in laying the 
<A NAME="535"></A>foundation.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let us divide all existing things into two, or rather, 
<A NAME="538"></A>if you do not object, into three classes.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Upon what principle would you make the 
<A NAME="540"></A>division?
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let us take some of our newly-found 
<A NAME="542"></A>notions.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Which of them?
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Were we not saying that God revealed a finite element 
<A NAME="545"></A>of existence, and also an infinite?
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let us assume these two principles, and also a third, 
<A NAME="548"></A>which is compounded out of them; but I fear that am ridiculously clumsy 
<A NAME="549"></A>at these processes of division and enumeration.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What do you mean, my good friend?
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I say that a fourth class is still 
<A NAME="552"></A>wanted.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What will that be?
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Find the cause of the third or compound, and add this 
<A NAME="555"></A>as a fourth class to the three others.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> And would you like to have a fifth dass or cause of 
<A NAME="557"></A>resolution as well as a cause of composition?
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Not, I think, at present; but if I want a fifth at 
<A NAME="559"></A>some future time you shall allow me to have it.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let us begin with the first three; and as we find two 
<A NAME="562"></A>out of the three greatly divided and dispersed, let us endeavour to reunite 
<A NAME="563"></A>them, and see how in each of them there is a one and 
<A NAME="564"></A>many.
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> If you would explain to me a little more about them, 
<A NAME="566"></A>perhaps I might be able to follow you.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, the two classes are the same which I mentioned 
<A NAME="568"></A>before, one the finite, and the other the infinite; I will first show that 
<A NAME="569"></A>the infinite is in a certain sense many, and the finite may be hereafter 
<A NAME="570"></A>discussed.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> I agree.
<A NAME="572"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And now consider well; for the question to which I 
<A NAME="573"></A>invite your attention is difficult and controverted. When you speak of 
<A NAME="574"></A>hotter and colder, can you conceive any limit in those qualities? Does 
<A NAME="575"></A>not the more and less, which dwells in their very nature, prevent their 
<A NAME="576"></A>having any end? for if they had an end, the more and less would themselves 
<A NAME="577"></A>have an end.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> That is most true.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Ever, as we say, into the hotter and the colder there 
<A NAME="580"></A>enters a more and a less.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, says the argument, there is never any end of 
<A NAME="583"></A>them, and being endless they must also be infinite.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes, Socrates, that is exceedingly 
<A NAME="585"></A>true.
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, my dear Protarchus, and your answer reminds me 
<A NAME="587"></A>that such an expression as "exceedingly," which you have just uttered, 
<A NAME="588"></A>and also the term "gently," have the same significance as more or less; 
<A NAME="589"></A>for whenever they occur they do not allow of the existence of quantity-they 
<A NAME="590"></A>are always introducing degrees into actions, instituting a comparison of 
<A NAME="591"></A>a more or a less excessive or a more or a less gentle, and at each creation 
<A NAME="592"></A>of more or less, quantity disappears. For, as I was just now saying, if 
<A NAME="593"></A>quantity and measure did not disappear, but were allowed to intrude in 
<A NAME="594"></A>the sphere of more and less and the other comparatives, these last would 
<A NAME="595"></A>be driven out of their own domain. When definite quantity is once admitted, 
<A NAME="596"></A>there can be no longer a "hotter" or a "colder" (for these are always progressing, 
<A NAME="597"></A>and are never in one stay); but definite quantity is at rest, and has ceased 
<A NAME="598"></A>to progress. Which proves that comparatives, such as the hotter, and the 
<A NAME="599"></A>colder, are to be ranked in the class of the infinite.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Your remark certainly, has the look of truth, Socrates; 
<A NAME="601"></A>but these subjects, as you were saying, are difficult to follow at first. 
<A NAME="602"></A>I think however, that if I could hear the argument repeated by you once 
<A NAME="603"></A>or twice, there would be a substantial agreement between 
<A NAME="604"></A>us.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, and I will try to meet your wish; but, as I would 
<A NAME="606"></A>rather not waste time in the enumeration of endless particulars, let me 
<A NAME="607"></A>know whether I may not assume as a note of the infinite-
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What?
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I want to know whether such things as appear to us 
<A NAME="610"></A>to admit of more or less, or are denoted by the words "exceedingly," "gently," 
<A NAME="611"></A>"extremely," and the like, may not be referred to the class of the infinite, 
<A NAME="612"></A>which is their unity, for, as was asserted in the previous argument, all 
<A NAME="613"></A>things that were divided and dispersed should be brought together, and 
<A NAME="614"></A>have the mark or seal of some one nature, if possible, set upon them-do 
<A NAME="615"></A>you remember?
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And all things which do not admit of more or less, 
<A NAME="618"></A>but admit their opposites, that is to say, first of all, equality, and 
<A NAME="619"></A>the equal, or again, the double, or any other ratio of number and measure-all 
<A NAME="620"></A>these may, I think, be rightly reckoned by us in the class of the limited 
<A NAME="621"></A>or finite; what do you say?
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Excellent, Socrates.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And now what nature shall we ascribe to the third or 
<A NAME="624"></A>compound kind?
<A NAME="625"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> You, I think, will have to tell me 
<A NAME="626"></A>that.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Rather God will tell you, if there be any God who will 
<A NAME="628"></A>listen to my prayers.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Offer up a prayer, then, and think.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I am thinking, Protarchus, and I believe that some 
<A NAME="631"></A>God has befriended us.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What do you mean, and what proof have you to offer 
<A NAME="633"></A>of what you are saying?
<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I will tell you, and do you listen to my 
<A NAME="635"></A>words.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Proceed.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Were we not speaking just now of hotter and 
<A NAME="638"></A>colder?
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> True.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Add to them drier, wetter, more, less, swifter, slower, 
<A NAME="641"></A>greater, smaller, and all that in the preceding argument we placed under 
<A NAME="642"></A>the unity of more and less.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> In the class of the infinite, you 
<A NAME="644"></A>mean?
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes; and now mingle this with the 
<A NAME="646"></A>other.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What is the other.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The class of the finite which we ought to have brought 
<A NAME="649"></A>together as we did the infinite; but, perhaps, it will come to the same 
<A NAME="650"></A>thing if we do so now;-when the two are combined, a third will 
<A NAME="651"></A>appear.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What do you mean by the class of the 
<A NAME="653"></A>finite?
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The class of the equal and the double, and any class 
<A NAME="655"></A>which puts an end to difference and opposition, and by introducing number 
<A NAME="656"></A>creates harmony and proportion among the different elements.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> I understand; you seem to me to mean that the various 
<A NAME="658"></A>opposites, when you mingle with them the class of the finite, takes certain 
<A NAME="659"></A>forms.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, that is my meaning.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Proceed.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Does not the right participation in the finite give 
<A NAME="663"></A>health-in disease, for instance?
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And whereas the high and low, the swift and the slow 
<A NAME="666"></A>are infinite or unlimited, does not the addition of the principles aforesaid 
<A NAME="667"></A>introduce a limit, and perfect the whole frame of music?
<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes, certainly.
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Or, again, when cold and heat prevail, does not the 
<A NAME="670"></A>introduction of them take away excess and indefiniteness, and infuse moderation 
<A NAME="671"></A>and harmony?
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And from a like admixture of the finite and infinite 
<A NAME="674"></A>come the seasons, and all the delights of life?
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I omit ten thousand other things, such as beauty and 
<A NAME="677"></A>health and strength, and the many beauties and high perfections of the 
<A NAME="678"></A>soul: O my beautiful Philebus, the goddess, methinks, seeing the universal 
<A NAME="679"></A>wantonness and wickedness of all things, and that there was in them no 
<A NAME="680"></A>limit to pleasures and self-indulgence, devised the limit of law and order, 
<A NAME="681"></A>whereby, as you say, Philebus, she torments, or as I maintain, delivers 
<A NAME="682"></A>the soul-What think you, Protarchus?
<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Her ways are much to my mind, Socrates.
<A NAME="684"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You will observe that I have spoken of three 
<A NAME="685"></A>classes?
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes, I think that I understand you: you mean to say 
<A NAME="687"></A>that the infinite is one class, and that the finite is a second class of 
<A NAME="688"></A>existences; but what you would make the third I am not so 
<A NAME="689"></A>certain.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That is because the amazing variety of the third class 
<A NAME="691"></A>is too much for you, my dear friend; but there was not this difficulty 
<A NAME="692"></A>with the infinite, which also comprehended many classes, for all of them 
<A NAME="693"></A>were sealed with the note of more and less, and therefore appeared 
<A NAME="694"></A>one.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> True.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the finite or limit had not many divisions, and 
<A NAME="697"></A>we ready acknowledged it to be by nature one?
<A NAME="698"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, indeed; and when I speak of the third class, understand 
<A NAME="700"></A>me to mean any offspring of these, being a birth into true being, effected 
<A NAME="701"></A>by the measure which the limit introduces.
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> I understand.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Still there was, as we said, a fourth class to be investigated, 
<A NAME="704"></A>and you must assist in the investigation; for does not everything which 
<A NAME="705"></A>comes into being, of necessity come into being through a 
<A NAME="706"></A>cause?
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes, certainly; for how can there be anything which 
<A NAME="708"></A>has no cause?
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is not the agent the same as the cause in all except 
<A NAME="710"></A>name; the agent and the cause may be rightly called 
<A NAME="711"></A>one?
<A NAME="712"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the same may be said of the patient, or effect; 
<A NAME="714"></A>we shall find that they too differ, as I was saying, only in name-shall 
<A NAME="715"></A>we not?
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> We shall.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The agent or cause always naturally leads, and the 
<A NAME="718"></A>patient or effect naturally follows it?
<A NAME="719"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then the cause and what is subordinate to it in generation 
<A NAME="721"></A>are not the same, but different?
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> True.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Did not the things which were generated, and the things 
<A NAME="724"></A>out of which they were generated, furnish all the three 
<A NAME="725"></A>classes?
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="727"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the creator or cause of them has been satisfactorily 
<A NAME="728"></A>proven to be distinct from them-and may therefore be called a fourth 
<A NAME="729"></A>principle?
<A NAME="730"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> So let us call it.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Quite right; but now, having distinguished the four, 
<A NAME="732"></A>I think that we had better refresh our memories by recapitulating each 
<A NAME="733"></A>of them in order.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then the first I will call the infinite or unlimited, 
<A NAME="736"></A>and the second the finite or limited; then follows the third, an essence 
<A NAME="737"></A>compound and generated; and I do not think that I shall be far wrong in 
<A NAME="738"></A>speaking of the cause of mixture and generation as the 
<A NAME="739"></A>fourth.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And now what is the next question, and how came we 
<A NAME="742"></A>hither? Were we not enquiring whether the second place belonged to pleasure 
<A NAME="743"></A>or wisdom?
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> We were.
<A NAME="745"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And now, having determined these points, shall we not 
<A NAME="746"></A>be better able to decide about the first and second place, which was the 
<A NAME="747"></A>original subject of dispute?
<A NAME="748"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> I dare say.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> We said, if you remember, that the mixed life of pleasure 
<A NAME="750"></A>and wisdom was the conqueror-did we not?
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> True.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And we see what is the place and nature of this life 
<A NAME="753"></A>and to what class it is to be assigned?
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Beyond a doubt.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> This is evidently comprehended in the third or mixed 
<A NAME="756"></A>class; which is not composed of any two particular ingredients, but of 
<A NAME="757"></A>all the elements of infinity, bound down by the finite, and may therefore 
<A NAME="758"></A>be truly said to comprehend the conqueror life.
<A NAME="759"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="760"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And what shall we say, Philebus, of your life which 
<A NAME="761"></A>is all sweetness; and in which of the aforesaid classes is that to be placed? 
<A NAME="762"></A>Perhaps you will allow me to ask you a question before you 
<A NAME="763"></A>answer?
<A NAME="764"></A><BR><BR><B>Phi.</B> Let me hear.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Have pleasure and pain a limit, or do they belong to 
<A NAME="766"></A>the class which admits of more and less?
<A NAME="767"></A><BR><BR><B>Phi.</B> They belong to the class which admits of more, Socrates; 
<A NAME="768"></A>for pleasure would not be perfectly good if she were not infinite in quantity 
<A NAME="769"></A>and degree.
<A NAME="770"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Nor would pain, Philebus, be perfectly evil. And therefore 
<A NAME="771"></A>the infinite cannot be that element which imparts to pleasure some degree 
<A NAME="772"></A>of good. But now-admitting, if you like, that pleasure is of the nature 
<A NAME="773"></A>of the infinite-in which of the aforesaid classes, O Protarchus and Philebus, 
<A NAME="774"></A>can we without irreverence place wisdom and knowledge and mind? And let 
<A NAME="775"></A>us be careful, for I think that the danger will be very serious if we err 
<A NAME="776"></A>on this point.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR><BR><B>Phi.</B> You magnify, Socrates, the importance of your favourite 
<A NAME="778"></A>god.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And you, my friend, are also magnifying your favourite 
<A NAME="780"></A>goddess; but still I must beg you to answer the question.
<A NAME="781"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Socrates is quite right, Philebus, and we must submit 
<A NAME="782"></A>to him.
<A NAME="783"></A><BR><BR><B>Phi.</B> And did not you, Protarchus, propose to answer in my 
<A NAME="784"></A>place?
<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly I did; but I am now in a great strait, and 
<A NAME="786"></A>I must entreat you, Socrates, to be our spokesman, and then we shall not 
<A NAME="787"></A>say anything wrong or disrespectful of your favourite.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I must obey you, Protarchus; nor is the task which 
<A NAME="789"></A>you impose a difficult one; but did I really, as Philebus implies, disconcert 
<A NAME="790"></A>you with my playful solemnity, when I asked the question to what class 
<A NAME="791"></A>mind and knowledge belong?
<A NAME="792"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> You did, indeed, Socrates.
<A NAME="793"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yet the answer is easy, since all philosophers assert 
<A NAME="794"></A>with one voice that mind is the king of heaven and earth-in reality they 
<A NAME="795"></A>are magnifying themselves. And perhaps they are right. But still I should 
<A NAME="796"></A>like to consider the class of mind, if you do not object, a little more 
<A NAME="797"></A>fully.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR><B>Phi.</B> Take your own course, Socrates, and never mind length; 
<A NAME="799"></A>we shall not tire of you.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Very good; let us begin then, Protarchus, by asking 
<A NAME="801"></A>a question.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What question?
<A NAME="803"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Whether all this which they call the universe is left 
<A NAME="804"></A>to the guidance of unreason and chance medley, or, on the contrary, as 
<A NAME="805"></A>our fathers have declared, ordered and governed by a marvellous intelligence 
<A NAME="806"></A>and wisdom.
<A NAME="807"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Wide asunder are the two assertions, illustrious Socrates, 
<A NAME="808"></A>for that which you were just now saying to me appears to be blasphemy; 
<A NAME="809"></A>but the other assertion, that mind orders all things, is worthy of the 
<A NAME="810"></A>aspect of the world, and of the sun, and of the moon, and of the stars 
<A NAME="811"></A>and of the whole circle of the heavens; and never will I say or think 
<A NAME="812"></A>otherwise.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Shall we then agree with them of old time in maintaining 
<A NAME="814"></A>this doctrine-not merely reasserting the notions of others, without risk 
<A NAME="815"></A>to ourselves,-but shall we share in the danger, and take our part of the 
<A NAME="816"></A>reproach which will await us, when an ingenious individual declares that 
<A NAME="817"></A>all is disorder?
<A NAME="818"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> That would certainly be my wish.
<A NAME="819"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then now please to consider the next stage of the 
<A NAME="820"></A>argument.
<A NAME="821"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Let me hear.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> We see that the elements which enter into the nature 
<A NAME="823"></A>of the bodies of all animals, fire, water, air, and, as the storm-tossed 
<A NAME="824"></A>sailor cries, "land" [i.e., earth], reappear in the constitution of the 
<A NAME="825"></A>world.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> The proverb may be applied to us; for truly the storm 
<A NAME="827"></A>gathers over us, and we are at our wit's end.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> There is something to be remarked about each of these 
<A NAME="829"></A>elements.
<A NAME="830"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="831"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Only a small fraction of any one of them exists in 
<A NAME="832"></A>us, and that of a mean sort, and not in any way pure, or having any power 
<A NAME="833"></A>worthy of its nature. One instance will prove this of all of them; there 
<A NAME="834"></A>is fire within us, and in the universe.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> True.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is not our fire small and weak and mean? But the 
<A NAME="837"></A>fire in the universe is wonderful in quantity and beauty, and in every 
<A NAME="838"></A>power that fire has.
<A NAME="839"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is the fire in the universe nourished and generated 
<A NAME="841"></A>and ruled by the fire in us, or is the fire in you and me, and in other 
<A NAME="842"></A>animals, dependent on the universal fire?
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> That is a question which does not deserve an 
<A NAME="844"></A>answer.
<A NAME="845"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Right; and you would say the same, if I am not mistaken, 
<A NAME="846"></A>of the earth which is in animals and the earth which is in the universe, 
<A NAME="847"></A>and you would give a similar reply about all the other 
<A NAME="848"></A>elements?
<A NAME="849"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Why, how could any man who gave any other be deemed 
<A NAME="850"></A>in his senses?
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I do not think that he could-but now go on to the next 
<A NAME="852"></A>step. When we saw those elements of which we have been speaking gathered 
<A NAME="853"></A>up in one, did we not call them a body?
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> We did.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the same may be said of the cosmos, which for the 
<A NAME="856"></A>same reason may be considered to be a body, because made up of the same 
<A NAME="857"></A>elements.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But is our body nourished wholly by this body, or is 
<A NAME="860"></A>this body nourished by our body, thence deriving and having the qualities 
<A NAME="861"></A>of which we were just now speaking?
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> That again, Socrates, is a question which does not 
<A NAME="863"></A>deserve to be asked.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, tell me, is this question worth 
<A NAME="865"></A>asking?
<A NAME="866"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What question?
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> May our body be said to have a soul?
<A NAME="868"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Clearly.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And whence comes that soul, my dear Protarchus, unless 
<A NAME="870"></A>the body of the universe, which contains elements like those in our bodies 
<A NAME="871"></A>but in every way fairer, had also a soul? Can there be another 
<A NAME="872"></A>source?
<A NAME="873"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Clearly, Socrates, that is the only 
<A NAME="874"></A>source.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why, yes, Protarchus; for surely we cannot imagine 
<A NAME="876"></A>that of the four classes, the finite, the infinite, the composition of 
<A NAME="877"></A>the two, and the cause, the fourth, which enters into all things, giving 
<A NAME="878"></A>to our bodies souls, and the art of self-management, and of healing disease, 
<A NAME="879"></A>and operating in other ways to heal and organize, having too all the attributes 
<A NAME="880"></A>of wisdom;-we cannot, I say, imagine that whereas the self-same elements 
<A NAME="881"></A>exist, both in the entire heaven and in great provinces of the heaven, 
<A NAME="882"></A>only fairer and purer, this last should not also in that higher sphere 
<A NAME="883"></A>have designed the noblest and fairest things?
<A NAME="884"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Such a supposition is quite unreasonable.
<A NAME="885"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then if this be denied, should we not be wise in adopting 
<A NAME="886"></A>the other view and maintaining that there is in the universe a mighty infinite 
<A NAME="887"></A>and an adequate limit, of which we have often spoken, as well as a presiding 
<A NAME="888"></A>cause of no mean power, which orders and arranges years and seasons and 
<A NAME="889"></A>months, and may be justly called wisdom and mind?
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Most justly.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And wisdom and mind cannot exist without 
<A NAME="892"></A>soul?
<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And in the divine nature of Zeus would you not say 
<A NAME="895"></A>that there is the soul and mind of a king, because there is in him the 
<A NAME="896"></A>power of the cause? And other gods have other attributes, by which they 
<A NAME="897"></A>are pleased to be called.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do not then suppose that these words are rashly spoken 
<A NAME="900"></A>by us, O Protarchus, for they are in harmony with the testimony of those 
<A NAME="901"></A>who said of old time that mind rules the universe.
<A NAME="902"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> True.
<A NAME="903"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And they furnish an answer to my enquiry; for they 
<A NAME="904"></A>imply that mind is the parent of that class of the four which we called 
<A NAME="905"></A>the cause of all; and I think that you now have my answer.
<A NAME="906"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> I have indeed, and yet I did not observe that you had 
<A NAME="907"></A>answered.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> A jest is sometimes refreshing, Protarchus, when it 
<A NAME="909"></A>interrupts earnest.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="911"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I think, friend, that we have now pretty clearly set 
<A NAME="912"></A>forth the class to which mind belongs and what is the power of 
<A NAME="913"></A>mind.
<A NAME="914"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> True.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the class to which pleasure belongs has also been 
<A NAME="916"></A>long ago discovered?
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And let us remember, too, of both of them, (1) that 
<A NAME="919"></A>mind was akin to the cause and of this family; and (2) that pleasure is 
<A NAME="920"></A>infinite and belongs to the class which neither has, nor ever will have 
<A NAME="921"></A>in itself, a beginning, middle, or end of its own.
<A NAME="922"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> I shall be sure to remember.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> We must next examine what is their place and under 
<A NAME="924"></A>what conditions they are generated. And we will begin with pleasure, since 
<A NAME="925"></A>her class was first examined; and yet pleasure cannot be rightly tested 
<A NAME="926"></A>apart from pain ever
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> If this is the road, let us take 
<A NAME="928"></A>it.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I wonder whether you would agree with me about the 
<A NAME="930"></A>origin of pleasure and pain.
<A NAME="931"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="932"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I mean to say that their natural seat is in the mixed 
<A NAME="933"></A>class.
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> And would you tell me again, sweet Socrates, which 
<A NAME="935"></A>of the aforesaid classes is the mixed one?
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I will my fine fellow, to the best of my 
<A NAME="937"></A>ability.
<A NAME="938"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let us then understand the mixed class to be that which 
<A NAME="940"></A>we placed third in the list of four.
<A NAME="941"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> That which followed the infinite and the finite; and 
<A NAME="942"></A>in which you ranked health, and, if I am not mistaken, 
<A NAME="943"></A>harmony.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Capital; and now will you please to give me your best 
<A NAME="945"></A>attention?
<A NAME="946"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Proceed; I am attending.
<A NAME="947"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I say that when the harmony in animals is dissolved, 
<A NAME="948"></A>there is also a dissolution of nature and a generation of 
<A NAME="949"></A>pain.
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> That is very probable.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the restoration of harmony and return to nature 
<A NAME="952"></A>is the source of pleasure, if I may be allowed to speak in the fewest and 
<A NAME="953"></A>shortest words about matters of the greatest moment.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> I believe that you are right, Socrates; but will you 
<A NAME="955"></A>try to be a little plainer?
<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do not obvious and every-day phenomena furnish the 
<A NAME="957"></A>simplest illustration?
<A NAME="958"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What phenomena do you mean?
<A NAME="959"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Hunger, for example, is a dissolution and a 
<A NAME="960"></A>pain.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> True.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Whereas eating is a replenishment and a 
<A NAME="963"></A>pleasure?
<A NAME="964"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="965"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Thirst again is a destruction and a pain, but the effect 
<A NAME="966"></A>of moisture replenishing the dry Place is a pleasure: once more, the unnatural 
<A NAME="967"></A>separation and dissolution caused by heat is painful, and the natural restoration 
<A NAME="968"></A>and refrigeration is pleasant.
<A NAME="969"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the unnatural freezing of the moisture in an animal 
<A NAME="971"></A>is pain, and the natural process of resolution and return of the elements 
<A NAME="972"></A>to their original state is pleasure. And would not the general proposition 
<A NAME="973"></A>seem to you to hold, that the destroying of the natural union of the finite 
<A NAME="974"></A>and infinite, which, as I was observing before, make up the class of living 
<A NAME="975"></A>beings, is pain, and that the process of return of all things to their 
<A NAME="976"></A>own nature is pleasure?
<A NAME="977"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Granted; what you say has a general 
<A NAME="978"></A>truth.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Here then is one kind of pleasures and pains originating 
<A NAME="980"></A>severally in the two processes which we have described?
<A NAME="981"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Good.
<A NAME="982"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let us next assume that in the soul herself there is 
<A NAME="983"></A>an antecedent hope of pleasure which is sweet and refreshing, and an expectation 
<A NAME="984"></A>of pain, fearful and anxious.
<A NAME="985"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes; this is another class of pleasures and pains, 
<A NAME="986"></A>which is of the soul only, apart from the body, and is produced by 
<A NAME="987"></A>expectation.
<A NAME="988"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Right; for in the analysis of these, pure, as I suppose 
<A NAME="989"></A>them to be, the pleasures being unalloyed with pain and the pains with 
<A NAME="990"></A>pleasure, methinks that we shall see clearly whether the whole class of 
<A NAME="991"></A>pleasure is to be desired, or whether this quality of entire desirableness 
<A NAME="992"></A>is not rather to be attributed to another of the classes which have been 
<A NAME="993"></A>mentioned; and whether pleasure and pain, like heat and cold, and other 
<A NAME="994"></A>things of the same kind, are not sometimes to be desired and sometimes 
<A NAME="995"></A>not to be desired, as being not in themselves good, but only sometimes 
<A NAME="996"></A>and in some instances admitting of the nature of good.
<A NAME="997"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> You say most truly that this is the track which the 
<A NAME="998"></A>investigation should pursue.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, then, assuming that pain ensues on the dissolution, 
<A NAME="1000"></A>and pleasure on the restoration of the harmony, let us now ask what will 
<A NAME="1001"></A>be the condition of animated beings who are neither in process of restoration 
<A NAME="1002"></A>nor of dissolution. And mind what you say: I ask whether any animal who 
<A NAME="1003"></A>is in that condition can possibly have any feeling of pleasure or pain, 
<A NAME="1004"></A>great or small?
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then here we have a third state, over and above that 
<A NAME="1007"></A>of pleasure and of pain?
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And do not forget that there is such a state; it will 
<A NAME="1010"></A>make a great difference in our judgment of pleasure, whether we remember 
<A NAME="1011"></A>this or not. And I should like to say a few words about 
<A NAME="1012"></A>it.
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What have you to say?
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why, you know that if a man chooses the life of wisdom, 
<A NAME="1015"></A>there is no reason why he should not live in this neutral 
<A NAME="1016"></A>state.
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> You mean that he may live neither rejoicing nor 
<A NAME="1018"></A>sorrowing?
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes; and if I remember rightly, when the lives were 
<A NAME="1020"></A>compared, no degree of pleasure, whether great or small, was thought to 
<A NAME="1021"></A>be necessary to him who chose the life of thought and 
<A NAME="1022"></A>wisdom.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes, certainly, we said so.
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then he will live without pleasure; and who knows whether 
<A NAME="1025"></A>this may not be the most divine of all lives?
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> If so, the gods, at any rate, cannot be supposed to 
<A NAME="1027"></A>have either joy or sorrow.
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Certainly not-there would be a great impropriety in 
<A NAME="1029"></A>the assumption of either alternative. But whether the gods are or are not 
<A NAME="1030"></A>indifferent to pleasure is a point which may be considered hereafter if 
<A NAME="1031"></A>in any way relevant to the argument, and whatever is the conclusion we 
<A NAME="1032"></A>will place it to the account of mind in her contest for the second place, 
<A NAME="1033"></A>should she have to resign the first.
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Just so.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The other class of pleasures, which as we were saying 
<A NAME="1036"></A>is purely mental, is entirely derived from memory.
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I must first of all analyse memory, or rather perception 
<A NAME="1039"></A>which is prior to, memory, if the subject of our discussion is ever to 
<A NAME="1040"></A>be properly cleared up.
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> How will you proceed?
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let us imagine affections of the body which are extinguished 
<A NAME="1043"></A>before they reach the soul, and leave her unaffected; and again, other 
<A NAME="1044"></A>affections which vibrate through both soul and body, and impart a shock 
<A NAME="1045"></A>to both and to each of them.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Granted.
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the soul may be truly said to be oblivious of the 
<A NAME="1048"></A>first but not of the second?
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> When I say oblivious, do not suppose that I mean forgetfulness 
<A NAME="1051"></A>in a literal sense; for forgetfulness is the exit of memory, which in this 
<A NAME="1052"></A>case has not yet entered; and to speak of the loss of that which is not 
<A NAME="1053"></A>yet in existence, and never has been, is a contradiction; do you 
<A NAME="1054"></A>see?
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then just be so good as to change the 
<A NAME="1057"></A>terms.
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> How shall I change them?
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Instead of the oblivion of the soul, when you are describing 
<A NAME="1060"></A>the state in which she is unaffected by the shocks of the body, say 
<A NAME="1061"></A>unconsciousness.
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> I see.
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the union or communion of soul and body in one 
<A NAME="1064"></A>feeling and motion would be properly called consciousness?
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then now we know the meaning of the 
<A NAME="1067"></A>word?
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And memory may, I think, be rightly described as the 
<A NAME="1070"></A>preservation of consciousness?
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Right.
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But do we not distinguish memory from 
<A NAME="1073"></A>recollection?
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> I think so.
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And do we not mean by recollection the power which 
<A NAME="1076"></A>the soul has of recovering, when by herself, some feeling which she experienced 
<A NAME="1077"></A>when in company with the body?
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And when she recovers of herself the lost recollection 
<A NAME="1080"></A>of some consciousness or knowledge, the recovery is termed recollection 
<A NAME="1081"></A>and reminiscence?
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> There is a reason why I say all 
<A NAME="1084"></A>this.
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I want to attain the plainest possible notion of pleasure 
<A NAME="1087"></A>and desire, as they exist in the mind only, apart from the body; and the 
<A NAME="1088"></A>previous analysis helps to show the nature of both.
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Then now, Socrates, let us proceed to the next 
<A NAME="1090"></A>point.
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> There are certainly many things to be considered in 
<A NAME="1092"></A>discussing the generation and whole complexion of pleasure. At the outset 
<A NAME="1093"></A>we must determine the nature and seat of desire.
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Ay; let us enquire into that, for we shall lose 
<A NAME="1095"></A>nothing.
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Nay, Protarchus, we shall surely lose the puzzle if 
<A NAME="1097"></A>we find the answer.
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> A fair retort; but let us proceed.
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Did we not place hunger, thirst, and the like, in the 
<A NAME="1100"></A>class of desires?
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And yet they are very different; what common nature 
<A NAME="1103"></A>have we in view when we call them by a single name?
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> By heavens, Socrates, that is a question which is, 
<A NAME="1105"></A>not easily answered; but it must be answered.
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then let us go back to our examples.
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Where shall we begin?
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do we mean anything when we say "a man 
<A NAME="1109"></A>thirsts"?
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> We mean to say that he "is empty"?
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is not thirst desire?
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes, of drink.
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Would you say of drink, or of replenishment with 
<A NAME="1116"></A>drink?
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> I should say, of replenishment with 
<A NAME="1118"></A>drink.
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then he who is empty desires, as would appear, the 
<A NAME="1120"></A>opposite of what he experiences; for he is empty and desires to be 
<A NAME="1121"></A>full?
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Clearly so.
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But how can a man who is empty for the first time, 
<A NAME="1124"></A>attain either by perception or memory to any apprehension of replenishment, 
<A NAME="1125"></A>of which he has no present or past experience?
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Impossible.
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And yet he who desires, surely desires 
<A NAME="1128"></A>something?
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> He does not desire that which he experiences, for he 
<A NAME="1131"></A>experiences thirst, and thirst is emptiness; but he desires 
<A NAME="1132"></A>replenishment?
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> True.
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then there must be something in the thirsty man which 
<A NAME="1135"></A>in some way apprehends replenishment?
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> There must.
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And that cannot be the body, for the body is supposed 
<A NAME="1138"></A>to be emptied?
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The only remaining alternative is that the soul apprehends 
<A NAME="1141"></A>the replenishment by the help of memory; as is obvious, for what other 
<A NAME="1142"></A>way can there be?
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> I cannot imagine any other.
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But do you see the consequence?
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That there is no such thing as desire of the 
<A NAME="1147"></A>body.
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Why so?
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why, because the argument shows that the endeavour 
<A NAME="1150"></A>of every animal is to the reverse of his bodily state.
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the impulse which leads him to the opposite of 
<A NAME="1153"></A>what he is experiencing proves that he has a memory of the opposite 
<A NAME="1154"></A>state.
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> True.
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the argument, having proved that memory attracts 
<A NAME="1157"></A>us towards the objects of desire, proves also that the impulses and the 
<A NAME="1158"></A>desires and the moving principle in every living being have their origin 
<A NAME="1159"></A>in the soul.
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Most true.
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The argument will not allow that our body either hungers 
<A NAME="1162"></A>or thirsts or has any similar experience.
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Quite right.
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let me make a further observation; the argument appears 
<A NAME="1165"></A>to me to imply that there is a kind of life which consists in these 
<A NAME="1166"></A>affections.
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Of what affections, and of what kind of life, are you 
<A NAME="1168"></A>speaking?
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I am speaking of being emptied and replenished, and 
<A NAME="1170"></A>of all that relates to the preservation and destruction of living beings, 
<A NAME="1171"></A>as well as of the pain which is felt in one of these states and of the 
<A NAME="1172"></A>pleasure which succeeds to it.
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> True.
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And what would you say of the intermediate 
<A NAME="1175"></A>state?
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What do you mean by "intermediate"?
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I mean when a person is in actual suffering and yet 
<A NAME="1178"></A>remembers past pleasures which, if they would only return, would relieve 
<A NAME="1179"></A>him; but as yet he has them not. May we not say of him, that he is in an 
<A NAME="1180"></A>intermediate state?
<A NAME="1181"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1182"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Would you say that he was wholly pained or wholly 
<A NAME="1183"></A>pleased?
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Nay, I should say that he has two pains; in his body 
<A NAME="1185"></A>there is the actual experience of pain, and in his soul longing and 
<A NAME="1186"></A>expectation.
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What do you mean, Protarchus, by the two pains? May 
<A NAME="1188"></A>not a man who is empty have at one time a sure hope of being filled, and 
<A NAME="1189"></A>at other times be quite in despair?
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="1191"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And has he not the pleasure of memory when he is hoping 
<A NAME="1192"></A>to be filled, and yet in that he is empty is he not at the same time in 
<A NAME="1193"></A>pain?
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then man and the other animals have at the same time 
<A NAME="1196"></A>both pleasure and pain?
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> I suppose so.
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But when a man is empty and has no hope of being filled, 
<A NAME="1199"></A>there will be the double experience of pain. You observed this and inferred 
<A NAME="1200"></A>that the double experience was the single case possible.
<A NAME="1201"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Quite true, Socrates.
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Shall the enquiry into these states of feeling be made 
<A NAME="1203"></A>the occasion of raising a question?
<A NAME="1204"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What question?
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Whether we ought to say that the pleasures and pains 
<A NAME="1206"></A>of which we are speaking are true or false? or some true and some 
<A NAME="1207"></A>false?
<A NAME="1208"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> But how, Socrates, can there be false pleasures and 
<A NAME="1209"></A>pains?
<A NAME="1210"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And how, Protarchus, can there be true and false fears, 
<A NAME="1211"></A>or true and false expectations, or true and false opinions?
<A NAME="1212"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> I grant that opinions may be true or false, but not 
<A NAME="1213"></A>pleasures.
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What do you mean? I am afraid that we are raising a 
<A NAME="1215"></A>very serious enquiry.
<A NAME="1216"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> There I agree.
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And yet, my boy, for you are one of Philebus' boys, 
<A NAME="1218"></A>the point to be considered, is, whether the enquiry is relevant to the 
<A NAME="1219"></A>argument.
<A NAME="1220"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Surely.
<A NAME="1221"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> No tedious and irrelevant discussion can be allowed; 
<A NAME="1222"></A>what is said should be pertinent.
<A NAME="1223"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Right.
<A NAME="1224"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I am always wondering at the question which has now 
<A NAME="1225"></A>been raised.
<A NAME="1226"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> How so?
<A NAME="1227"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do you deny that some pleasures are false, and others 
<A NAME="1228"></A>true?
<A NAME="1229"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> To be sure I do.
<A NAME="1230"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Would you say that no one ever seemed to rejoice and 
<A NAME="1231"></A>yet did not rejoice, or seemed to feel pain and yet did not feel pain, 
<A NAME="1232"></A>sleeping or waking, mad or lunatic?
<A NAME="1233"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> So we have always held, Socrates.
<A NAME="1234"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But were you right? Shall we enquire into the truth 
<A NAME="1235"></A>of your opinion?
<A NAME="1236"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> I think that we should.
<A NAME="1237"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let us then put into more precise terms the question 
<A NAME="1238"></A>which has arisen about pleasure and opinion. Is there such a thing as 
<A NAME="1239"></A>opinion?
<A NAME="1240"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1241"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And such a thing as pleasure?
<A NAME="1242"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1243"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And an opinion must of something?
<A NAME="1244"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> True.
<A NAME="1245"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And a man must be pleased by something?
<A NAME="1246"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Quite correct.
<A NAME="1247"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And whether the opinion be right or wrong, makes no 
<A NAME="1248"></A>difference; it will still be an opinion?
<A NAME="1249"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1250"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And he who is pleased, whether he is rightly pleased 
<A NAME="1251"></A>or not will always have a real feeling of pleasure?
<A NAME="1252"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes; that is also quite true.
<A NAME="1253"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, how can opinion be both true and false, and pleasure 
<A NAME="1254"></A>true only, although pleasure and opinion are both equally 
<A NAME="1255"></A>real?
<A NAME="1256"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes; that is the question.
<A NAME="1257"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You mean that opinion admits of truth and falsehood, 
<A NAME="1258"></A>and hence becomes not merely opinion, but opinion of a certain quality; 
<A NAME="1259"></A>and this is what you think should be examined?
<A NAME="1260"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1261"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And further, even if we admit the existence of qualities 
<A NAME="1262"></A>in other objects, may not pleasure and pain be simple and devoid of 
<A NAME="1263"></A>quality?
<A NAME="1264"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Clearly.
<A NAME="1265"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But there is no difficulty in seeing that Pleasure 
<A NAME="1266"></A>and pain as well as opinion have qualities, for they are great or small, 
<A NAME="1267"></A>and have various degrees of intensity; as was indeed said long ago by 
<A NAME="1268"></A>us.
<A NAME="1269"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="1270"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if badness attaches to any of them, Protarchus, 
<A NAME="1271"></A>then we should speak of a bad opinion or of a bad pleasure?
<A NAME="1272"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Quite true, Socrates.
<A NAME="1273"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if rightness attaches to any of them, should we 
<A NAME="1274"></A>not speak of a right opinion or right pleasure; and in like manner of the 
<A NAME="1275"></A>reverse of rightness?
<A NAME="1276"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1277"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if the thing opined be erroneous, might we not 
<A NAME="1278"></A>say that opinion, being erroneous, is not right or rightly 
<A NAME="1279"></A>opined?
<A NAME="1280"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1281"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if we see a pleasure or pain which errs in respect 
<A NAME="1282"></A>of its object, shall we call that right or good, or by any honourable 
<A NAME="1283"></A>name?
<A NAME="1284"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Not if the pleasure is mistaken; how could 
<A NAME="1285"></A>we?
<A NAME="1286"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And surely pleasure often appears to accompany an opinion 
<A NAME="1287"></A>which is not true, but false?
<A NAME="1288"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly it does; and in that case, Socrates, as we 
<A NAME="1289"></A>were saying, the opinion is false, but no one could call the actual pleasure 
<A NAME="1290"></A>false.
<A NAME="1291"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> How eagerly, Protarchus, do you rush to the defence 
<A NAME="1292"></A>of pleasure!
<A NAME="1293"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Nay, Socrates, I only repeat what I 
<A NAME="1294"></A>hear.
<A NAME="1295"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is there no difference, my friend, between that 
<A NAME="1296"></A>pleasure which is associated with right opinion and knowledge, and that 
<A NAME="1297"></A>which is often found in all of us associated with falsehood and 
<A NAME="1298"></A>ignorance?
<A NAME="1299"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> There must be a very great difference, between 
<A NAME="1300"></A>them.
<A NAME="1301"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, now let us proceed to contemplate this 
<A NAME="1302"></A>difference.
<A NAME="1303"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Lead, and I will follow.
<A NAME="1304"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, then, my view is-
<A NAME="1305"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="1306"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> We agree-do we not?-that there is such a thing as false, 
<A NAME="1307"></A>and also such a thing as true opinion?
<A NAME="1308"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1309"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And pleasure and pain, as I was just now saying, are 
<A NAME="1310"></A>often consequent upon these upon true and false opinion, I 
<A NAME="1311"></A>mean.
<A NAME="1312"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="1313"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And do not opinion and the endeavour to form an opinion 
<A NAME="1314"></A>always spring from memory and perception?
<A NAME="1315"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1316"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Might we imagine the process to be something of this 
<A NAME="1317"></A>nature?
<A NAME="1318"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Of what nature?
<A NAME="1319"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> An object may be often seen at a distance not very 
<A NAME="1320"></A>clearly, and the seer may want to determine what it is which he 
<A NAME="1321"></A>sees.
<A NAME="1322"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Very likely.
<A NAME="1323"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Soon he begins to interrogate himself.
<A NAME="1324"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> In what manner?
<A NAME="1325"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> He asks himself-"What is that which appears to be standing 
<A NAME="1326"></A>by the rock under the tree?" This is the question which he may be supposed 
<A NAME="1327"></A>to put to himself when he sees such an appearance.
<A NAME="1328"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> True.
<A NAME="1329"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> To which he may guess the right answer, saying as if 
<A NAME="1330"></A>in a whisper to himself-"It is a man."
<A NAME="1331"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="1332"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Or again, he may be misled, and then he will say-"No, 
<A NAME="1333"></A>it is a figure made by the shepherds."
<A NAME="1334"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1335"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if he has a companion, he repeats his thought to 
<A NAME="1336"></A>him in articulate sounds, and what was before an opinion, has now become 
<A NAME="1337"></A>a proposition.
<A NAME="1338"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1339"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But if he be walking alone when these thoughts occur 
<A NAME="1340"></A>to him, he may not unfrequently keep them in his mind for a considerable 
<A NAME="1341"></A>time.
<A NAME="1342"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="1343"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, now, I wonder whether, you would agree in my 
<A NAME="1344"></A>explanation of this phenomenon.
<A NAME="1345"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro.</B> What is your explanation?
<A NAME="1346"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I think that the soul at such times is like a 
<A NAME="1347"></A>book.
<A NAME="1348"></A><BR><BR><B>Pro
