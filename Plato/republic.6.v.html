<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Socrates - GLAUCON - ADEIMANTUS
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Such is the good and true City or State, and the good and man is 
<A NAME="12"></A>of the same pattern; and if this is right every other is wrong; and the 
<A NAME="13"></A>evil is one which affects not only the ordering of the State, but also 
<A NAME="14"></A>the regulation of the individual soul, and is exhibited in four 
<A NAME="15"></A>forms.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>What are they? he said.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>I was proceeding to tell the order in which the four evil forms appeared 
<A NAME="18"></A>to me to succeed one another, when Pole marchus, who was sitting a little 
<A NAME="19"></A>way off, just beyond Adeimantus, began to whisper to him: stretching forth 
<A NAME="20"></A>his hand, he took hold of the upper part of his coat by the shoulder, and 
<A NAME="21"></A>drew him towards him, leaning forward himself so as to be quite close and 
<A NAME="22"></A>saying something in his ear, of which I only caught the words, 'Shall we 
<A NAME="23"></A>let him off, or what shall we do?
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not, said Adeimantus, raising his 
<A NAME="25"></A>voice.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Who is it, I said, whom you are refusing to let 
<A NAME="27"></A>off?
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>You, he said.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>I repeated, Why am I especially not to be let off?
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Why, he said, we think that you are lazy, and mean to cheat us out 
<A NAME="31"></A>of a whole chapter which is a very important part of the story; and you 
<A NAME="32"></A>fancy that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding; as if it were 
<A NAME="33"></A>self-evident to everybody, that in the matter of women and children 'friends 
<A NAME="34"></A>have all things in common.'
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>And was I not right, Adeimantus?
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>Yes, he said; but what is right in this particular case, like everything 
<A NAME="37"></A>else, requires to be explained; for community may be of many kinds. Please, 
<A NAME="38"></A>therefore, to say what sort of community you mean. We have been long expecting 
<A NAME="39"></A>that you would tell us something about the family life of your citizens 
<A NAME="40"></A>--how they will bring children into the world, and rear them when they 
<A NAME="41"></A>have arrived, and, in general, what is the nature of this community of 
<A NAME="42"></A>women and children-for we are of opinion that the right or wrong management 
<A NAME="43"></A>of such matters will have a great and paramount influence on the State 
<A NAME="44"></A>for good or for evil. And now, since the question is still undetermined, 
<A NAME="45"></A>and you are taking in hand another State, we have resolved, as you heard, 
<A NAME="46"></A>not to let you go until you give an account of all this.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>To that resolution, said Glaucon, you may regard me as saying 
<A NAME="48"></A>Agreed.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>Socrates - ADEIMANTUS - GLAUCON - THRASYMACHUS
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>And without more ado, said Thrasymachus, you may consider us all 
<A NAME="51"></A>to be equally agreed.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>I said, You know not what you are doing in thus assailing me: What 
<A NAME="53"></A>an argument are you raising about the State! Just as I thought that I had 
<A NAME="54"></A>finished, and was only too glad that I had laid this question to sleep, 
<A NAME="55"></A>and was reflecting how fortunate I was in your acceptance of what I then 
<A NAME="56"></A>said, you ask me to begin again at the very foundation, ignorant of what 
<A NAME="57"></A>a hornet's nest of words you are stirring. Now I foresaw this gathering 
<A NAME="58"></A>trouble, and avoided it.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>For what purpose do you conceive that we have come here, said Thrasymachus, 
<A NAME="60"></A>--to look for gold, or to hear discourse?
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>Yes, but discourse should have a limit.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Yes, Socrates, said Glaucon, and the whole of life is the only limit 
<A NAME="63"></A>which wise men assign to the hearing of such discourses. But never mind 
<A NAME="64"></A>about us; take heart yourself and answer the question in your own way: 
<A NAME="65"></A>What sort of community of women and children is this which is to prevail 
<A NAME="66"></A>among our guardians? and how shall we manage the period between birth and 
<A NAME="67"></A>education, which seems to require the greatest care? Tell us how these 
<A NAME="68"></A>things will be.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>Yes, my simple friend, but the answer is the reverse of easy; many 
<A NAME="70"></A>more doubts arise about this than about our previous conclusions. For the 
<A NAME="71"></A>practicability of what is said may be doubted; and looked at in another 
<A NAME="72"></A>point of view, whether the scheme, if ever so practicable, would be for 
<A NAME="73"></A>the best, is also doubtful. Hence I feel a reluctance to approach the subject, 
<A NAME="74"></A>lest our aspiration, my dear friend, should turn out to be a dream 
<A NAME="75"></A>only.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>Fear not, he replied, for your audience will not be hard upon you; 
<A NAME="77"></A>they are not sceptical or hostile.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>I said: My good friend, I suppose that you mean to encourage me 
<A NAME="79"></A>by these words.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Then let me tell you that you are doing just the reverse; the encouragement 
<A NAME="82"></A>which you offer would have been all very well had I myself believed that 
<A NAME="83"></A>I knew what I was talking about: to declare the truth about matters of 
<A NAME="84"></A>high interest which a man honours and loves among wise men who love him 
<A NAME="85"></A>need occasion no fear or faltering in his mind; but to carry on an argument 
<A NAME="86"></A>when you are yourself only a hesitating enquirer, which is my condition, 
<A NAME="87"></A>is a dangerous and slippery thing; and the danger is not that I shall be 
<A NAME="88"></A>laughed at (of which the fear would be childish), but that I shall miss 
<A NAME="89"></A>the truth where I have most need to be sure of my footing, and drag my 
<A NAME="90"></A>friends after me in my fall. And I pray Nemesis not to visit upon me the 
<A NAME="91"></A>words which I am going to utter. For I do indeed believe that to be an 
<A NAME="92"></A>involuntary homicide is a less crime than to be a deceiver about beauty 
<A NAME="93"></A>or goodness or justice in the matter of laws. And that is a risk which 
<A NAME="94"></A>I would rather run among enemies than among friends, and therefore you 
<A NAME="95"></A>do well to encourage me.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>Glaucon laughed and said: Well then, Socrates, in case you and 
<A NAME="97"></A>your argument do us any serious injury you shall be acquitted beforehand 
<A NAME="98"></A>of the and shall not be held to be a deceiver; take courage then and 
<A NAME="99"></A>speak.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>Well, I said, the law says that when a man is acquitted he is free 
<A NAME="101"></A>from guilt, and what holds at law may hold in argument.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>Then why should you mind?
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Well, I replied, I suppose that I must retrace my steps and say what 
<A NAME="104"></A>I perhaps ought to have said before in the proper place. The part of the 
<A NAME="105"></A>men has been played out, and now properly enough comes the turn of the 
<A NAME="106"></A>women. Of them I will proceed to speak, and the more readily since I am 
<A NAME="107"></A>invited by you.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>For men born and educated like our citizens, the only way, in my 
<A NAME="109"></A>opinion, of arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and use 
<A NAME="110"></A>of women and children is to follow the path on which we originally started, 
<A NAME="111"></A>when we said that the men were to be the guardians and watchdogs of the 
<A NAME="112"></A>herd.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Let us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be subject 
<A NAME="115"></A>to similar or nearly similar regulations; then we shall see whether the 
<A NAME="116"></A>result accords with our design.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean?
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>What I mean may be put into the form of a question, I said: Are dogs 
<A NAME="119"></A>divided into hes and shes, or do they both share equally in hunting and 
<A NAME="120"></A>in keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs? or do we entrust to the 
<A NAME="121"></A>males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks, while we leave the females 
<A NAME="122"></A>at home, under the idea that the bearing and suckling their puppies is 
<A NAME="123"></A>labour enough for them?
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>No, he said, they share alike; the only difference between them 
<A NAME="125"></A>is that the males are stronger and the females weaker.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>But can you use different animals for the same purpose, unless 
<A NAME="127"></A>they are bred and fed in the same way?
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>You cannot.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Then, if women are to have the same duties as men, they must have the 
<A NAME="130"></A>same nurture and education?
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>The education which was assigned to the men was music and gymnastic. 
<A NAME="133"></A>Yes.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>Then women must be taught music and gymnastic and also the art 
<A NAME="135"></A>of war, which they must practise like the men?
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>That is the inference, I suppose.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>I should rather expect, I said, that several of our proposals, if they 
<A NAME="138"></A>are carried out, being unusual, may appear ridiculous.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>No doubt of it.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>Yes, and the most ridiculous thing of all will be the sight of women 
<A NAME="141"></A>naked in the palaestra, exercising with the men, especially when they are 
<A NAME="142"></A>no longer young; they certainly will not be a vision of beauty, any more 
<A NAME="143"></A>than the enthusiastic old men who in spite of wrinkles and ugliness continue 
<A NAME="144"></A>to frequent the gymnasia.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>Yes, indeed, he said: according to present notions the proposal 
<A NAME="146"></A>would be thought ridiculous.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>But then, I said, as we have determined to speak our minds, we 
<A NAME="148"></A>must not fear the jests of the wits which will be directed against this 
<A NAME="149"></A>sort of innovation; how they will talk of women's attainments both in music 
<A NAME="150"></A>and gymnastic, and above all about their wearing armour and riding upon 
<A NAME="151"></A>horseback!
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he replied.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Yet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the law; 
<A NAME="154"></A>at the same time begging of these gentlemen for once in their life to be 
<A NAME="155"></A>serious. Not long ago, as we shall remind them, the Hellenes were of the 
<A NAME="156"></A>opinion, which is still generally received among the barbarians, that the 
<A NAME="157"></A>sight of a naked man was ridiculous and improper; and when first the Cretans 
<A NAME="158"></A>and then the Lacedaemonians introduced the custom, the wits of that day 
<A NAME="159"></A>might equally have ridiculed the innovation.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>No doubt.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>But when experience showed that to let all things be uncovered was 
<A NAME="162"></A>far better than to cover them up, and the ludicrous effect to the outward 
<A NAME="163"></A>eye vanished before the better principle which reason asserted, then the 
<A NAME="164"></A>man was perceived to be a fool who directs the shafts of his ridicule at 
<A NAME="165"></A>any other sight but that of folly and vice, or seriously inclines to weigh 
<A NAME="166"></A>the beautiful by any other standard but that of the 
<A NAME="167"></A>good.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he replied.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>First, then, whether the question is to be put in jest or in earnest, 
<A NAME="170"></A>let us come to an understanding about the nature of woman: Is she capable 
<A NAME="171"></A>of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men, or not at 
<A NAME="172"></A>all? And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not 
<A NAME="173"></A>share? That will be the best way of commencing the enquiry, and will probably 
<A NAME="174"></A>lead to the fairest conclusion.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>That will be much the best way.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Shall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against ourselves; 
<A NAME="177"></A>in this manner the adversary's position will not be 
<A NAME="178"></A>undefended.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>Why not? he said.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Then let us put a speech into the mouths of our opponents. They will 
<A NAME="181"></A>say: 'Socrates and Glaucon, no adversary need convict you, for you yourselves, 
<A NAME="182"></A>at the first foundation of the State, admitted the principle that everybody 
<A NAME="183"></A>was to do the one work suited to his own nature.' And certainly, if I am 
<A NAME="184"></A>not mistaken, such an admission was made by us. 'And do not the natures 
<A NAME="185"></A>of men and women differ very much indeed?' And we shall reply: Of course 
<A NAME="186"></A>they do. Then we shall be asked, 'Whether the tasks assigned to men and 
<A NAME="187"></A>to women should not be different, and such as are agreeable to their different 
<A NAME="188"></A>natures?' Certainly they should. 'But if so, have you not fallen into a 
<A NAME="189"></A>serious inconsistency in saying that men and women, whose natures are so 
<A NAME="190"></A>entirely different, ought to perform the same actions?' --What defence 
<A NAME="191"></A>will you make for us, my good Sir, against any one who offers these 
<A NAME="192"></A>objections?
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>That is not an easy question to answer when asked suddenly; and 
<A NAME="194"></A>I shall and I do beg of you to draw out the case on our 
<A NAME="195"></A>side.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>These are the objections, Glaucon, and there are many others of 
<A NAME="197"></A>a like kind, which I foresaw long ago; they made me afraid and reluctant 
<A NAME="198"></A>to take in hand any law about the possession and nurture of women and 
<A NAME="199"></A>children.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>By Zeus, he said, the problem to be solved is anything but 
<A NAME="201"></A>easy.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Why yes, I said, but the fact is that when a man is out of his depth, 
<A NAME="203"></A>whether he has fallen into a little swimming bath or into mid-ocean, he 
<A NAME="204"></A>has to swim all the same.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>And must not we swim and try to reach the shore: we will hope that 
<A NAME="207"></A>Arion's dolphin or some other miraculous help may save 
<A NAME="208"></A>us?
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>I suppose so, he said.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Well then, let us see if any way of escape can be found. We acknowledged 
<A NAME="211"></A>--did we not? that different natures ought to have different pursuits, 
<A NAME="212"></A>and that men's and women's natures are different. And now what are we saying? 
<A NAME="213"></A>--that different natures ought to have the same pursuits, --this is the 
<A NAME="214"></A>inconsistency which is charged upon us.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>Precisely.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Verily, Glaucon, I said, glorious is the power of the art of 
<A NAME="217"></A>contradiction!
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>Why do you say so?
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Because I think that many a man falls into the practice against his 
<A NAME="220"></A>will. When he thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing, just 
<A NAME="221"></A>because he cannot define and divide, and so know that of which he is speaking; 
<A NAME="222"></A>and he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the spirit of contention 
<A NAME="223"></A>and not of fair discussion.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he replied, such is very often the case; but what has that 
<A NAME="225"></A>to do with us and our argument?
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>A great deal; for there is certainly a danger of our getting unintentionally 
<A NAME="227"></A>into a verbal opposition.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>In what way?
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Why, we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth, that 
<A NAME="230"></A>different natures ought to have different pursuits, but we never considered 
<A NAME="231"></A>at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of nature, or why 
<A NAME="232"></A>we distinguished them when we assigned different pursuits to different 
<A NAME="233"></A>natures and the same to the same natures.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>Why, no, he said, that was never considered by 
<A NAME="235"></A>us.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>I said: Suppose that by way of illustration we were to ask the question 
<A NAME="237"></A>whether there is not an opposition in nature between bald men and hairy 
<A NAME="238"></A>men; and if this is admitted by us, then, if bald men are cobblers, we 
<A NAME="239"></A>should forbid the hairy men to be cobblers, and conversely?
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>That would be a jest, he said.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Yes, I said, a jest; and why? because we never meant when we constructed 
<A NAME="242"></A>the State, that the opposition of natures should extend to every difference, 
<A NAME="243"></A>but only to those differences which affected the pursuit in which the individual 
<A NAME="244"></A>is engaged; we should have argued, for example, that a physician and one 
<A NAME="245"></A>who is in mind a physician may be said to have the same 
<A NAME="246"></A>nature.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Whereas the physician and the carpenter have different 
<A NAME="249"></A>natures?
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>And if, I said, the male and female sex appear to differ in their fitness 
<A NAME="252"></A>for any art or pursuit, we should say that such pursuit or art ought to 
<A NAME="253"></A>be assigned to one or the other of them; but if the difference consists 
<A NAME="254"></A>only in women bearing and men begetting children, this does not amount 
<A NAME="255"></A>to a proof that a woman differs from a man in respect of the sort of education 
<A NAME="256"></A>she should receive; and we shall therefore continue to maintain that our 
<A NAME="257"></A>guardians and their wives ought to have the same pursuits.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Next, we shall ask our opponent how, in reference to any of the pursuits 
<A NAME="260"></A>or arts of civic life, the nature of a woman differs from that of a 
<A NAME="261"></A>man?
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>That will be quite fair.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>And perhaps he, like yourself, will reply that to give a sufficient 
<A NAME="264"></A>answer on the instant is not easy; but after a little reflection there 
<A NAME="265"></A>is no difficulty.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>Yes, perhaps.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Suppose then that we invite him to accompany us in the argument, and 
<A NAME="268"></A>then we may hope to show him that there is nothing peculiar in the constitution 
<A NAME="269"></A>of women which would affect them in the administration of the 
<A NAME="270"></A>State.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>By all means.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Let us say to him: Come now, and we will ask you a question: --when 
<A NAME="273"></A>you spoke of a nature gifted or not gifted in any respect, did you mean 
<A NAME="274"></A>to say that one man will acquire a thing easily, another with difficulty; 
<A NAME="275"></A>a little learning will lead the one to discover a great deal; whereas the 
<A NAME="276"></A>other, after much study and application, no sooner learns than he forgets; 
<A NAME="277"></A>or again, did you mean, that the one has a body which is a good servant 
<A NAME="278"></A>to his mind, while the body of the other is a hindrance to him?-would not 
<A NAME="279"></A>these be the sort of differences which distinguish the man gifted by nature 
<A NAME="280"></A>from the one who is ungifted?
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>No one will deny that.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>And can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex has 
<A NAME="283"></A>not all these gifts and qualities in a higher degree than the female? Need 
<A NAME="284"></A>I waste time in speaking of the art of weaving, and the management of pancakes 
<A NAME="285"></A>and preserves, in which womankind does really appear to be great, and in 
<A NAME="286"></A>which for her to be beaten by a man is of all things the most 
<A NAME="287"></A>absurd?
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>You are quite right, he replied, in maintaining the general inferiority 
<A NAME="289"></A>of the female sex: although many women are in many things superior to many 
<A NAME="290"></A>men, yet on the whole what you say is true.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>And if so, my friend, I said, there is no special faculty of administration 
<A NAME="292"></A>in a state which a woman has because she is a woman, or which a man has 
<A NAME="293"></A>by virtue of his sex, but the gifts of nature are alike diffused in both; 
<A NAME="294"></A>all the pursuits of men are the pursuits of women also, but in all of them 
<A NAME="295"></A>a woman is inferior to a man.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>Then are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on 
<A NAME="298"></A>women?
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>That will never do.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>One woman has a gift of healing, another not; one is a musician, and 
<A NAME="301"></A>another has no music in her nature?
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>And one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises, and 
<A NAME="304"></A>another is unwarlike and hates gymnastics?
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>And one woman is a philosopher, and another is an enemy of philosophy; 
<A NAME="307"></A>one has spirit, and another is without spirit?
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>That is also true.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Then one woman will have the temper of a guardian, and another not. 
<A NAME="310"></A>Was not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of 
<A NAME="311"></A>this sort?
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>Men and women alike possess the qualities which make a guardian; they 
<A NAME="314"></A>differ only in their comparative strength or weakness.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>Obviously.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>And those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the companions 
<A NAME="317"></A>and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom they resemble 
<A NAME="318"></A>in capacity and in character?
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>And ought not the same natures to have the same 
<A NAME="321"></A>pursuits?
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>They ought.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Then, as we were saying before, there is nothing unnatural in assigning 
<A NAME="324"></A>music and gymnastic to the wives of the guardians --to that point we come 
<A NAME="325"></A>round again.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>The law which we then enacted was agreeable to nature, and therefore 
<A NAME="328"></A>not an impossibility or mere aspiration; and the contrary practice, which 
<A NAME="329"></A>prevails at present, is in reality a violation of nature.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>That appears to be true.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>We had to consider, first, whether our proposals were possible, and 
<A NAME="332"></A>secondly whether they were the most beneficial?
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>And the possibility has been acknowledged?
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>The very great benefit has next to be established?
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Quite so.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>You will admit that the same education which makes a man a good guardian 
<A NAME="339"></A>will make a woman a good guardian; for their original nature is the 
<A NAME="340"></A>same?
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>I should like to ask you a question.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>What is it?
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Would you say that all men are equal in excellence, or is one man better 
<A NAME="345"></A>than another?
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>The latter.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>And in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the 
<A NAME="348"></A>guardians who have been brought up on our model system to be more perfect 
<A NAME="349"></A>men, or the cobblers whose education has been cobbling?
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>What a ridiculous question!
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>You have answered me, I replied: Well, and may we not further say that 
<A NAME="352"></A>our guardians are the best of our citizens?
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>By far the best.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>And will not their wives be the best women?
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Yes, by far the best.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>And can there be anything better for the interests of the State than 
<A NAME="357"></A>that the men and women of a State should be as good as 
<A NAME="358"></A>possible?
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>There can be nothing better.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>And this is what the arts of music and gymnastic, when present in such 
<A NAME="361"></A>manner as we have described, will accomplish?
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>Then we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest 
<A NAME="364"></A>degree beneficial to the State?
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Then let the wives of our guardians strip, for their virtue will be 
<A NAME="367"></A>their robe, and let them share in the toils of war and the defence of their 
<A NAME="368"></A>country; only in the distribution of labours the lighter are to be assigned 
<A NAME="369"></A>to the women, who are the weaker natures, but in other respects their duties 
<A NAME="370"></A>are to be the same. And as for the man who laughs at naked women exercising 
<A NAME="371"></A>their bodies from the best of motives, in his laughter he is 
<A NAME="372"></A>plucking
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>A fruit of unripe wisdom, and he himself is ignorant of what he 
<A NAME="374"></A>is laughing at, or what he is about; --for that is, and ever will be, the 
<A NAME="375"></A>best of sayings, That the useful is the noble and the hurtful is the 
<A NAME="376"></A>base.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Here, then, is one difficulty in our law about women, which we may 
<A NAME="379"></A>say that we have now escaped; the wave has not swallowed us up alive for 
<A NAME="380"></A>enacting that the guardians of either sex should have all their pursuits 
<A NAME="381"></A>in common; to the utility and also to the possibility of this arrangement 
<A NAME="382"></A>the consistency of the argument with itself bears witness.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that was a mighty wave which you have escaped.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>Yes, I said, but a greater is coming; you will of this when you see 
<A NAME="385"></A>the next.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>Go on; let me see.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>The law, I said, which is the sequel of this and of all that has preceded, 
<A NAME="388"></A>is to the following effect, --'that the wives of our guardians are to be 
<A NAME="389"></A>common, and their children are to be common, and no parent is to know his 
<A NAME="390"></A>own child, nor any child his parent.'
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that is a much greater wave than the other; and the 
<A NAME="392"></A>possibility as well as the utility of such a law are far more 
<A NAME="393"></A>questionable.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>I do not think, I said, that there can be any dispute about the 
<A NAME="395"></A>very great utility of having wives and children in common; the possibility 
<A NAME="396"></A>is quite another matter, and will be very much disputed.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>I think that a good many doubts may be raised about 
<A NAME="398"></A>both.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>You imply that the two questions must be combined, I replied. Now I 
<A NAME="400"></A>meant that you should admit the utility; and in this way, as I thought; 
<A NAME="401"></A>I should escape from one of them, and then there would remain only the 
<A NAME="402"></A>possibility.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>But that little attempt is detected, and therefore you will please 
<A NAME="404"></A>to give a defence of both.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>Well, I said, I submit to my fate. Yet grant me a little favour: 
<A NAME="406"></A>let me feast my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of 
<A NAME="407"></A>feasting themselves when they are walking alone; for before they have discovered 
<A NAME="408"></A>any means of effecting their wishes --that is a matter which never troubles 
<A NAME="409"></A>them --they would rather not tire themselves by thinking about possibilities; 
<A NAME="410"></A>but assuming that what they desire is already granted to them, they proceed 
<A NAME="411"></A>with their plan, and delight in detailing what they mean to do when their 
<A NAME="412"></A>wish has come true --that is a way which they have of not doing much good 
<A NAME="413"></A>to a capacity which was never good for much. Now I myself am beginning 
<A NAME="414"></A>to lose heart, and I should like, with your permission, to pass over the 
<A NAME="415"></A>question of possibility at present. Assuming therefore the possibility 
<A NAME="416"></A>of the proposal, I shall now proceed to enquire how the rulers will carry 
<A NAME="417"></A>out these arrangements, and I shall demonstrate that our plan, if executed, 
<A NAME="418"></A>will be of the greatest benefit to the State and to the guardians. First 
<A NAME="419"></A>of all, then, if you have no objection, I will endeavour with your help 
<A NAME="420"></A>to consider the advantages of the measure; and hereafter the question of 
<A NAME="421"></A>possibility.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>I have no objection; proceed.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>First, I think that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to be worthy 
<A NAME="424"></A>of the name which they bear, there must be willingness to obey in the one 
<A NAME="425"></A>and the power of command in the other; the guardians must themselves obey 
<A NAME="426"></A>the laws, and they must also imitate the spirit of them in any details 
<A NAME="427"></A>which are entrusted to their care.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>That is right, he said.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>You, I said, who are their legislator, having selected the men, will 
<A NAME="430"></A>now select the women and give them to them; --they must be as far as possible 
<A NAME="431"></A>of like natures with them; and they must live in common houses and meet 
<A NAME="432"></A>at common meals, None of them will have anything specially his or her own; 
<A NAME="433"></A>they will be together, and will be brought up together, and will associate 
<A NAME="434"></A>at gymnastic exercises. And so they will be drawn by a necessity of their 
<A NAME="435"></A>natures to have intercourse with each other --necessity is not too strong 
<A NAME="436"></A>a word, I think?
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; --necessity, not geometrical, but another sort of 
<A NAME="438"></A>necessity which lovers know, and which is far more convincing and constraining 
<A NAME="439"></A>to the mass of mankind.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>True, I said; and this, Glaucon, like all the rest, must proceed 
<A NAME="441"></A>after an orderly fashion; in a city of the blessed, licentiousness is an 
<A NAME="442"></A>unholy thing which the rulers will forbid.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, and it ought not to be permitted.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Then clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony sacred in the 
<A NAME="445"></A>highest degree, and what is most beneficial will be deemed 
<A NAME="446"></A>sacred?
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>And how can marriages be made most beneficial? --that is a question 
<A NAME="449"></A>which I put to you, because I see in your house dogs for hunting, and of 
<A NAME="450"></A>the nobler sort of birds not a few. Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have 
<A NAME="451"></A>you ever attended to their pairing and breeding?
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>In what particulars?
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Why, in the first place, although they are all of a good sort, are 
<A NAME="454"></A>not some better than others?
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>And do you breed from them all indifferently, or do you take care to 
<A NAME="457"></A>breed from the best only?
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR>From the best.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>And do you take the oldest or the youngest, or only those of ripe 
<A NAME="460"></A>age?
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>I choose only those of ripe age.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>And if care was not taken in the breeding, your dogs and birds would 
<A NAME="463"></A>greatly deteriorate?
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>And the same of horses and animals in general?
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>Undoubtedly.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Good heavens! my dear friend, I said, what consummate skill will our 
<A NAME="468"></A>rulers need if the same principle holds of the human 
<A NAME="469"></A>species!
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, the same principle holds; but why does this involve 
<A NAME="471"></A>any particular skill?
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>Because, I said, our rulers will often have to practise upon the 
<A NAME="473"></A>body corporate with medicines. Now you know that when patients do not require 
<A NAME="474"></A>medicines, but have only to be put under a regimen, the inferior sort of 
<A NAME="475"></A>practitioner is deemed to be good enough; but when medicine has to be given, 
<A NAME="476"></A>then the doctor should be more of a man.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR>That is quite true, he said; but to what are you 
<A NAME="478"></A>alluding?
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>I mean, I replied, that our rulers will find a considerable dose of 
<A NAME="480"></A>falsehood and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects: we were 
<A NAME="481"></A>saying that the use of all these things regarded as medicines might be 
<A NAME="482"></A>of advantage.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>And we were very right.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>And this lawful use of them seems likely to be often needed in the 
<A NAME="485"></A>regulations of marriages and births.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>How so?
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Why, I said, the principle has been already laid down that the best 
<A NAME="488"></A>of either sex should be united with the best as often, and the inferior 
<A NAME="489"></A>with the inferior, as seldom as possible; and that they should rear the 
<A NAME="490"></A>offspring of the one sort of union, but not of the other, if the flock 
<A NAME="491"></A>is to be maintained in first-rate condition. Now these goings on must be 
<A NAME="492"></A>a secret which the rulers only know, or there will be a further danger 
<A NAME="493"></A>of our herd, as the guardians may be termed, breaking out into 
<A NAME="494"></A>rebellion.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Had we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring 
<A NAME="497"></A>together the brides and bridegrooms, and sacrifices will be offered and 
<A NAME="498"></A>suitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets: the number of weddings is 
<A NAME="499"></A>a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers, whose aim 
<A NAME="500"></A>will be to preserve the average of population? There are many other things 
<A NAME="501"></A>which they will have to consider, such as the effects of wars and diseases 
<A NAME="502"></A>and any similar agencies, in order as far as this is possible to prevent 
<A NAME="503"></A>the State from becoming either too large or too small.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he replied.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>We shall have to invent some ingenious kind of lots which the less 
<A NAME="506"></A>worthy may draw on each occasion of our bringing them together, and then 
<A NAME="507"></A>they will accuse their own ill-luck and not the rulers.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>To be sure, he said.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>And I think that our braver and better youth, besides their other honours 
<A NAME="510"></A>and rewards, might have greater facilities of intercourse with women given 
<A NAME="511"></A>them; their bravery will be a reason, and such fathers ought to have as 
<A NAME="512"></A>many sons as possible.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>And the proper officers, whether male or female or both, for offices 
<A NAME="515"></A>are to be held by women as well as by men --
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>Yes --
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>The proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to 
<A NAME="518"></A>the pen or fold, and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who 
<A NAME="519"></A>dwell in a separate quarter; but the offspring of the inferior, or of the 
<A NAME="520"></A>better when they chance to be deformed, will be put away in some mysterious, 
<A NAME="521"></A>unknown place, as they should be.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that must be done if the breed of the guardians is 
<A NAME="523"></A>to be kept pure.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>They will provide for their nurture, and will bring the mothers 
<A NAME="525"></A>to the fold when they are full of milk, taking the greatest possible care 
<A NAME="526"></A>that no mother recognizes her own child; and other wet-nurses may be engaged 
<A NAME="527"></A>if more are required. Care will also be taken that the process of suckling 
<A NAME="528"></A>shall not be protracted too long; and the mothers will have no getting 
<A NAME="529"></A>up at night or other trouble, but will hand over all this sort of thing 
<A NAME="530"></A>to the nurses and attendants.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>You suppose the wives of our guardians to have a fine easy time 
<A NAME="532"></A>of it when they are having children.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>Why, said I, and so they ought. Let us, however, proceed with our 
<A NAME="534"></A>scheme. We were saying that the parents should be in the prime of 
<A NAME="535"></A>life?
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>And what is the prime of life? May it not be defined as a period of 
<A NAME="538"></A>about twenty years in a woman's life, and thirty in a 
<A NAME="539"></A>man's?
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>Which years do you mean to include?
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>A woman, I said, at twenty years of age may begin to bear children 
<A NAME="542"></A>to the State, and continue to bear them until forty; a man may begin at 
<A NAME="543"></A>five-and-twenty, when he has passed the point at which the pulse of life 
<A NAME="544"></A>beats quickest, and continue to beget children until he be 
<A NAME="545"></A>fifty-five.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said, both in men and women those years are the prime 
<A NAME="547"></A>of physical as well as of intellectual vigour.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR>Any one above or below the prescribed ages who takes part in the 
<A NAME="549"></A>public hymeneals shall be said to have done an unholy and unrighteous thing; 
<A NAME="550"></A>the child of which he is the father, if it steals into life, will have 
<A NAME="551"></A>been conceived under auspices very unlike the sacrifices and prayers, which 
<A NAME="552"></A>at each hymeneal priestesses and priest and the whole city will offer, 
<A NAME="553"></A>that the new generation may be better and more useful than their good and 
<A NAME="554"></A>useful parents, whereas his child will be the offspring of darkness and 
<A NAME="555"></A>strange lust.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he replied.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>And the same law will apply to any one of those within the prescribed 
<A NAME="558"></A>age who forms a connection with any woman in the prime of life without 
<A NAME="559"></A>the sanction of the rulers; for we shall say that he is raising up a bastard 
<A NAME="560"></A>to the State, uncertified and unconsecrated.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he replied.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>This applies, however, only to those who are within the specified age: 
<A NAME="563"></A>after that we allow them to range at will, except that a man may not marry 
<A NAME="564"></A>his daughter or his daughter's daughter, or his mother or his mother's 
<A NAME="565"></A>mother; and women, on the other hand, are prohibited from marrying their 
<A NAME="566"></A>sons or fathers, or son's son or father's father, and so on in either direction. 
<A NAME="567"></A>And we grant all this, accompanying the permission with strict orders to 
<A NAME="568"></A>prevent any embryo which may come into being from seeing the light; and 
<A NAME="569"></A>if any force a way to the birth, the parents must understand that the offspring 
<A NAME="570"></A>of such an union cannot be maintained, and arrange accordingly.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR>That also, he said, is a reasonable proposition. But how will they 
<A NAME="572"></A>know who are fathers and daughters, and so on?
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>They will never know. The way will be this: --dating from the day 
<A NAME="574"></A>of the hymeneal, the bridegroom who was then married will call all the 
<A NAME="575"></A>male children who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards his 
<A NAME="576"></A>sons, and the female children his daughters, and they will call him father, 
<A NAME="577"></A>and he will call their children his grandchildren, and they will call the 
<A NAME="578"></A>elder generation grandfathers and grandmothers. All who were begotten at 
<A NAME="579"></A>the time when their fathers and mothers came together will be called their 
<A NAME="580"></A>brothers and sisters, and these, as I was saying, will be forbidden to 
<A NAME="581"></A>inter-marry. This, however, is not to be understood as an absolute prohibition 
<A NAME="582"></A>of the marriage of brothers and sisters; if the lot favours them, and they 
<A NAME="583"></A>receive the sanction of the Pythian oracle, the law will allow 
<A NAME="584"></A>them.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR><BR>Quite right, he replied.
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Such is the scheme, Glaucon, according to which the guardians of our 
<A NAME="587"></A>State are to have their wives and families in common. And now you would 
<A NAME="588"></A>have the argument show that this community is consistent with the rest 
<A NAME="589"></A>of our polity, and also that nothing can be better --would you 
<A NAME="590"></A>not?
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR>Yes, certainly.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Shall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought 
<A NAME="593"></A>to be the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the organization 
<A NAME="594"></A>of a State, --what is the greatest I good, and what is the greatest evil, 
<A NAME="595"></A>and then consider whether our previous description has the stamp of the 
<A NAME="596"></A>good or of the evil?
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>By all means.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Can there be any greater evil than discord and distraction and plurality 
<A NAME="599"></A>where unity ought to reign? or any greater good than the bond of 
<A NAME="600"></A>unity?
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>There cannot.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>And there is unity where there is community of pleasures and pains 
<A NAME="603"></A>--where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions of joy 
<A NAME="604"></A>and sorrow?
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>No doubt.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Yes; and where there is no common but only private feeling a State 
<A NAME="607"></A>is disorganized --when you have one half of the world triumphing and the 
<A NAME="608"></A>other plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city or the 
<A NAME="609"></A>citizens?
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Such differences commonly originate in a disagreement about the use 
<A NAME="612"></A>of the terms 'mine' and 'not mine,' 'his' and 'not his.'
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR>Exactly so.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>And is not that the best-ordered State in which the greatest number 
<A NAME="615"></A>of persons apply the terms 'mine' and 'not mine' in the same way to the 
<A NAME="616"></A>same thing?
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR>Quite true.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Or that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the 
<A NAME="619"></A>individual --as in the body, when but a finger of one of us is hurt, the 
<A NAME="620"></A>whole frame, drawn towards the soul as a center and forming one kingdom 
<A NAME="621"></A>under the ruling power therein, feels the hurt and sympathizes all together 
<A NAME="622"></A>with the part affected, and we say that the man has a pain in his finger; 
<A NAME="623"></A>and the same expression is used about any other part of the body, which 
<A NAME="624"></A>has a sensation of pain at suffering or of pleasure at the alleviation 
<A NAME="625"></A>of suffering.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he replied; and I agree with you that in the best-ordered 
<A NAME="627"></A>State there is the nearest approach to this common feeling which you 
<A NAME="628"></A>describe.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>Then when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil, 
<A NAME="630"></A>the whole State will make his case their own, and will either rejoice or 
<A NAME="631"></A>sorrow with him?
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that is what will happen in a well-ordered 
<A NAME="633"></A>State.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>It will now be time, I said, for us to return to our State and see 
<A NAME="635"></A>whether this or some other form is most in accordance with these fundamental 
<A NAME="636"></A>principles.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR>Very good.
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Our State like every other has rulers and subjects?
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>All of whom will call one another citizens?
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>But is there not another name which people give to their rulers in 
<A NAME="643"></A>other States?
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>Generally they call them masters, but in democratic States they 
<A NAME="645"></A>simply call them rulers.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>And in our State what other name besides that of citizens do the 
<A NAME="647"></A>people give the rulers?
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR>They are called saviours and helpers, he replied.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>And what do the rulers call the people?
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Their maintainers and foster-fathers.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>And what do they call them in other States?
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Slaves.
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>And what do the rulers call one another in other 
<A NAME="654"></A>States?
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>Fellow-rulers.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>And what in ours?
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>Fellow-guardians.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Did you ever know an example in any other State of a ruler who would 
<A NAME="659"></A>speak of one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not being 
<A NAME="660"></A>his friend?
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR>Yes, very often.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>And the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest, 
<A NAME="663"></A>and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>But would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian 
<A NAME="666"></A>as a stranger?
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>Certainly he would not; for every one whom they meet will be regarded 
<A NAME="668"></A>by them either as a brother or sister, or father or mother, or son or daughter, 
<A NAME="669"></A>or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected with 
<A NAME="670"></A>him.
<A NAME="671"></A><BR><BR>Capital, I said; but let me ask you once more: Shall they be a 
<A NAME="672"></A>family in name only; or shall they in all their actions be true to the 
<A NAME="673"></A>name? For example, in the use of the word 'father,' would the care of a 
<A NAME="674"></A>father be implied and the filial reverence and duty and obedience to him 
<A NAME="675"></A>which the law commands; and is the violator of these duties to be regarded 
<A NAME="676"></A>as an impious and unrighteous person who is not likely to receive much 
<A NAME="677"></A>good either at the hands of God or of man? Are these to be or not to be 
<A NAME="678"></A>the strains which the children will hear repeated in their ears by all 
<A NAME="679"></A>the citizens about those who are intimated to them to be their parents 
<A NAME="680"></A>and the rest of their kinsfolk?
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>These, he said, and none other; for what can be more ridiculous 
<A NAME="682"></A>than for them to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and 
<A NAME="683"></A>not to act in the spirit of them?
<A NAME="684"></A><BR><BR>Then in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more 
<A NAME="685"></A>often beard than in any other. As I was describing before, when any one 
<A NAME="686"></A>is well or ill, the universal word will be with me it is well' or 'it is 
<A NAME="687"></A>ill.'
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>Most true.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>And agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking, were we not saying 
<A NAME="690"></A>that they will have their pleasures and pains in common?
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>Yes, and so they will.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>And they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will 
<A NAME="693"></A>alike call 'my own,' and having this common interest they will have a common 
<A NAME="694"></A>feeling of pleasure and pain?
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>Yes, far more so than in other States.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>And the reason of this, over and above the general constitution of 
<A NAME="697"></A>the State, will be that the guardians will have a community of women and 
<A NAME="698"></A>children?
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>That will be the chief reason.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>And this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good, as was 
<A NAME="701"></A>implied in our own comparison of a well-ordered State to the relation of 
<A NAME="702"></A>the body and the members, when affected by pleasure or 
<A NAME="703"></A>pain?
<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR>That we acknowledged, and very rightly.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Then the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly 
<A NAME="706"></A>the source of the greatest good to the State?
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>And this agrees with the other principle which we were affirming, --that 
<A NAME="709"></A>the guardians were not to have houses or lands or any other property; their 
<A NAME="710"></A>pay was to be their food, which they were to receive from the other citizens, 
<A NAME="711"></A>and they were to have no private expenses; for we intended them to preserve 
<A NAME="712"></A>their true character of guardians.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR>Right, he replied.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Both the community of property and the community of families, as I 
<A NAME="715"></A>am saying, tend to make them more truly guardians; they will not tear the 
<A NAME="716"></A>city in pieces by differing about 'mine' and 'not mine;' each man dragging 
<A NAME="717"></A>any acquisition which he has made into a separate house of his own, where 
<A NAME="718"></A>he has a separate wife and children and private pleasures and pains; but 
<A NAME="719"></A>all will be affected as far as may be by the same pleasures and pains because 
<A NAME="720"></A>they are all of one opinion about what is near and dear to them, and therefore 
<A NAME="721"></A>they all tend towards a common end.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he replied.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>And as they have nothing but their persons which they can call their 
<A NAME="724"></A>own, suits and complaints will have no existence among them; they will 
<A NAME="725"></A>be delivered from all those quarrels of which money or children or relations 
<A NAME="726"></A>are the occasion.
<A NAME="727"></A><BR><BR>Of course they will.
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>Neither will trials for assault or insult ever be likely to occur among 
<A NAME="729"></A>them. For that equals should defend themselves against equals we shall 
<A NAME="730"></A>maintain to be honourable and right; we shall make the protection of the 
<A NAME="731"></A>person a matter of necessity.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR><BR>That is good, he said.
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Yes; and there is a further good in the law; viz. that if a man has 
<A NAME="734"></A>a quarrel with another he will satisfy his resentment then and there, and 
<A NAME="735"></A>not proceed to more dangerous lengths.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>To the elder shall be assigned the duty of ruling and chastising the 
<A NAME="738"></A>younger.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>Nor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do any 
<A NAME="741"></A>other violence to an elder, unless the magistrates command him; nor will 
<A NAME="742"></A>he slight him in any way. For there are two guardians, shame and fear, 
<A NAME="743"></A>mighty to prevent him: shame, which makes men refrain from laying hands 
<A NAME="744"></A>on those who are to them in the relation of parents; fear, that the injured 
<A NAME="745"></A>one will be succoured by the others who are his brothers, sons, one wi 
<A NAME="746"></A>fathers.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>That is true, he replied.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Then in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace 
<A NAME="749"></A>with one another?
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR>Yes, there will be no want of peace.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>And as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there will 
<A NAME="752"></A>be no danger of the rest of the city being divided either against them 
<A NAME="753"></A>or against one another.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>None whatever.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>I hardly like even to mention the little meannesses of which they will 
<A NAME="756"></A>be rid, for they are beneath notice: such, for example, as the flattery 
<A NAME="757"></A>of the rich by the poor, and all the pains and pangs which men experience 
<A NAME="758"></A>in bringing up a family, and in finding money to buy necessaries for their 
<A NAME="759"></A>household, borrowing and then repudiating, getting how they can, and giving 
<A NAME="760"></A>the money into the hands of women and slaves to keep --the many evils of 
<A NAME="761"></A>so many kinds which people suffer in this way are mean enough and obvious 
<A NAME="762"></A>enough, and not worth speaking of.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, a man has no need of eyes in order to perceive 
<A NAME="764"></A>that.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>And from all these evils they will be delivered, and their life will 
<A NAME="766"></A>be blessed as the life of Olympic victors and yet more 
<A NAME="767"></A>blessed.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR><BR>How so?
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>The Olympic victor, I said, is deemed happy in receiving a part only 
<A NAME="770"></A>of the blessedness which is secured to our citizens, who have won a more 
<A NAME="771"></A>glorious victory and have a more complete maintenance at the public cost. 
<A NAME="772"></A>For the victory which they have won is the salvation of the whole State; 
<A NAME="773"></A>and the crown with which they and their children are crowned is the fulness 
<A NAME="774"></A>of all that life needs; they receive rewards from the hands of their country 
<A NAME="775"></A>while living, and after death have an honourable burial.
<A NAME="776"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, and glorious rewards they are.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Do you remember, I said, how in the course of the previous discussion 
<A NAME="778"></A>some one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians unhappy 
<A NAME="779"></A>--they had nothing and might have possessed all things-to whom we replied 
<A NAME="780"></A>that, if an occasion offered, we might perhaps hereafter consider this 
<A NAME="781"></A>question, but that, as at present advised, we would make our guardians 
<A NAME="782"></A>truly guardians, and that we were fashioning the State with a view to the 
<A NAME="783"></A>greatest happiness, not of any particular class, but of the 
<A NAME="784"></A>whole?
<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I remember.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>And what do you say, now that the life of our protectors is made out 
<A NAME="787"></A>to be far better and nobler than that of Olympic victors --is the life 
<A NAME="788"></A>of shoemakers, or any other artisans, or of husbandmen, to be compared 
<A NAME="789"></A>with it?
<A NAME="790"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>At the same time I ought here to repeat what I have said elsewhere, 
<A NAME="792"></A>that if any of our guardians shall try to be happy in such a manner that 
<A NAME="793"></A>he will cease to be a guardian, and is not content with this safe and harmonious 
<A NAME="794"></A>life, which, in our judgment, is of all lives the best, but infatuated 
<A NAME="795"></A>by some youthful conceit of happiness which gets up into his head shall 
<A NAME="796"></A>seek to appropriate the whole State to himself, then he will have to learn 
<A NAME="797"></A>how wisely Hesiod spoke, when he said, 'half is more than the 
<A NAME="798"></A>whole.'
<A NAME="799"></A><BR><BR>If he were to consult me, I should say to him: Stay where you are, 
<A NAME="800"></A>when you have the offer of such a life.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR><BR>You agree then, I said, that men and women are to have a common 
<A NAME="802"></A>way of life such as we have described --common education, common children; 
<A NAME="803"></A>and they are to watch over the citizens in common whether abiding in the 
<A NAME="804"></A>city or going out to war; they are to keep watch together, and to hunt 
<A NAME="805"></A>together like dogs; and always and in all things, as far as they are able, 
<A NAME="806"></A>women are to share with the men? And in so doing they will do what is best, 
<A NAME="807"></A>and will not violate, but preserve the natural relation of the 
<A NAME="808"></A>sexes.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR>I agree with you, he replied.
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>The enquiry, I said, has yet to be made, whether such a community be 
<A NAME="811"></A>found possible --as among other animals, so also among men --and if possible, 
<A NAME="812"></A>in what way possible?
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR>You have anticipated the question which I was about to 
<A NAME="814"></A>suggest.
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>There is no difficulty, I said, in seeing how war will be carried on 
<A NAME="816"></A>by them.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR>How?
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>Why, of course they will go on expeditions together; and will take 
<A NAME="819"></A>with them any of their children who are strong enough, that, after the 
<A NAME="820"></A>manner of the artisan's child, they may look on at the work which they 
<A NAME="821"></A>will have to do when they are grown up; and besides looking on they will 
<A NAME="822"></A>have to help and be of use in war, and to wait upon their fathers and mothers. 
<A NAME="823"></A>Did you never observe in the arts how the potters' boys look on and help, 
<A NAME="824"></A>long before they touch the wheel?
<A NAME="825"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I have.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>And shall potters be more careful in educating their children and in 
<A NAME="827"></A>giving them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties than 
<A NAME="828"></A>our guardians will be?
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><BR>The idea is ridiculous, he said.
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>There is also the effect on the parents, with whom, as with other animals, 
<A NAME="831"></A>the presence of their young ones will be the greatest incentive to 
<A NAME="832"></A>valour.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR><BR>That is quite true, Socrates; and yet if they are defeated, which 
<A NAME="834"></A>may often happen in war, how great the danger is! the children will be 
<A NAME="835"></A>lost as well as their parents, and the State will never 
<A NAME="836"></A>recover.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR><BR>True, I said; but would you never allow them to run any 
<A NAME="838"></A>risk?
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>I am far from saying that.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Well, but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on some 
<A NAME="841"></A>occasion when, if they escape disaster, they will be the better for 
<A NAME="842"></A>it?
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>Whether the future soldiers do or do not see war in the days of their 
<A NAME="845"></A>youth is a very important matter, for the sake of which some risk may fairly 
<A NAME="846"></A>be incurred.
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><BR>Yes, very important.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>This then must be our first step, --to make our children spectators 
<A NAME="849"></A>of war; but we must also contrive that they shall be secured against danger; 
<A NAME="850"></A>then all will be well.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>Their parents may be supposed not to be blind to the risks of war, 
<A NAME="853"></A>but to know, as far as human foresight can, what expeditions are safe and 
<A NAME="854"></A>what dangerous?
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR>That may be assumed.
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>And they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about 
<A NAME="857"></A>the dangerous ones?
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>And they will place them under the command of experienced veterans 
<A NAME="860"></A>who will be their leaders and teachers?
<A NAME="861"></A><BR><BR>Very properly.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>Still, the dangers of war cannot be always foreseen; there is a good 
<A NAME="863"></A>deal of chance about them?
<A NAME="864"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>Then against such chances the children must be at once furnished with 
<A NAME="866"></A>wings, in order that in the hour of need they may fly away and 
<A NAME="867"></A>escape.
<A NAME="868"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean? he said.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>I mean that we must mount them on horses in their earliest youth, and 
<A NAME="870"></A>when they have learnt to ride, take them on horseback to see war: the horses 
<A NAME="871"></A>must be spirited and warlike, but the most tractable and yet the swiftest 
<A NAME="872"></A>that can be had. In this way they will get an excellent view of what is 
<A NAME="873"></A>hereafter to be their own business; and if there is danger they have only 
<A NAME="874"></A>to follow their elder leaders and escape.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR><BR>I believe that you are right, he said.
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>Next, as to war; what are to be the relations of your soldiers to one 
<A NAME="877"></A>another and to their enemies? I should be inclined to propose that the 
<A NAME="878"></A>soldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms, or is guilty of any 
<A NAME="879"></A>other act of cowardice, should be degraded into the rank of a husbandman 
<A NAME="880"></A>or artisan. What do you think?
<A NAME="881"></A><BR><BR>By all means, I should say.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>And he who allows himself to be taken prisoner may as well be made 
<A NAME="883"></A>a present of to his enemies; he is their lawful prey, and let them do what 
<A NAME="884"></A>they like with him.
<A NAME="885"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>But the hero who has distinguished himself, what shall be done to him? 
<A NAME="887"></A>In the first place, he shall receive honour in the army from his youthful 
<A NAME="888"></A>comrades; every one of them in succession shall crown him. What do you 
<A NAME="889"></A>say?
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR>I approve.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>And what do you say to his receiving the right hand of 
<A NAME="892"></A>fellowship?
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>To that too, I agree.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>But you will hardly agree to my next proposal.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>What is your proposal?
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>That he should kiss and be kissed by them.
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>Most certainly, and I should be disposed to go further, and say: Let 
<A NAME="898"></A>no one whom he has a mind to kiss refuse to be kissed by him while the 
<A NAME="899"></A>expedition lasts. So that if there be a lover in the army, whether his 
<A NAME="900"></A>love be youth or maiden, he may be more eager to win the prize of 
<A NAME="901"></A>valour.
<A NAME="902"></A><BR><BR>Capital, I said. That the brave man is to have more wives than 
<A NAME="903"></A>others has been already determined: and he is to have first choices in 
<A NAME="904"></A>such matters more than others, in order that he may have as many children 
<A NAME="905"></A>as possible?
<A NAME="906"></A><BR><BR>Agreed.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>Again, there is another manner in which, according to Homer, brave 
<A NAME="908"></A>youths should be honoured; for he tells how Ajax, after he had distinguished 
<A NAME="909"></A>himself in battle, was rewarded with long chines, which seems to be a compliment 
<A NAME="910"></A>appropriate to a hero in the flower of his age, being not only a tribute 
<A NAME="911"></A>of honour but also a very strengthening thing.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR>Most true, he said.
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>Then in this, I said, Homer shall be our teacher; and we too, at sacrifices 
<A NAME="914"></A>and on the like occasions, will honour the brave according to the measure 
<A NAME="915"></A>of their valour, whether men or women, with hymns and those other distinctions 
<A NAME="916"></A>which we were mentioning; also with
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR>seats of precedence, and meats and full cups; and in honouring 
<A NAME="918"></A>them, we shall be at the same time training them.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR><BR>That, he replied, is excellent.
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>Yes, I said; and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not say, 
<A NAME="921"></A>in the first place, that he is of the golden race?
<A NAME="922"></A><BR><BR>To be sure.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>Nay, have we not the authority of Hesiod for affirming that when they 
<A NAME="924"></A>are dead
<A NAME="925"></A><BR><BR>They are holy angels upon the earth, authors of good, averters 
<A NAME="926"></A>of evil, the guardians of speech-gifted men?
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR>Yes; and we accept his authority.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>We must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of divine 
<A NAME="929"></A>and heroic personages, and what is to be their special distinction and 
<A NAME="930"></A>we must do as he bids?
<A NAME="931"></A><BR><BR>By all means.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>And in ages to come we will reverence them and knee. before their sepulchres 
<A NAME="933"></A>as at the graves of heroes. And not only they but any who are deemed pre-eminently 
<A NAME="934"></A>good, whether they die from age, or in any other way, shall be admitted 
<A NAME="935"></A>to the same honours.
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR>That is very right, he said.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>Next, how shall our soldiers treat their enemies? What about 
<A NAME="938"></A>this?
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>In what respect do you mean?
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>First of all, in regard to slavery? Do you think it right that Hellenes 
<A NAME="941"></A>should enslave Hellenic States, or allow others to enslave them, if they 
<A NAME="942"></A>can help? Should not their custom be to spare them, considering the danger 
<A NAME="943"></A>which there is that the whole race may one day fall under the yoke of the 
<A NAME="944"></A>barbarians?
<A NAME="945"></A><BR><BR>To spare them is infinitely better.
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>Then no Hellene should be owned by them as a slave; that is a rule 
<A NAME="947"></A>which they will observe and advise the other Hellenes to 
<A NAME="948"></A>observe.
<A NAME="949"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said; they will in this way be united against the 
<A NAME="950"></A>barbarians and will keep their hands off one another.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR><BR>Next as to the slain; ought the conquerors, I said, to take anything 
<A NAME="952"></A>but their armour? Does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford an 
<A NAME="953"></A>excuse for not facing the battle? Cowards skulk about the dead, pretending 
<A NAME="954"></A>that they are fulfilling a duty, and many an army before now has been lost 
<A NAME="955"></A>from this love of plunder.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>And is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse, and 
<A NAME="958"></A>also a degree of meanness and womanishness in making an enemy of the dead 
<A NAME="959"></A>body when the real enemy has flown away and left only his fighting gear 
<A NAME="960"></A>behind him, --is not this rather like a dog who cannot get at his assailant, 
<A NAME="961"></A>quarrelling with the stones which strike him instead?
<A NAME="962"></A><BR><BR>Very like a dog, he said.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>Then we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their 
<A NAME="964"></A>burial?
<A NAME="965"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he replied, we most certainly must.
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>Neither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods, least of 
<A NAME="967"></A>all the arms of Hellenes, if we care to maintain good feeling with other 
<A NAME="968"></A>Hellenes; and, indeed, we have reason to fear that the offering of spoils 
<A NAME="969"></A>taken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by the god 
<A NAME="970"></A>himself?
<A NAME="971"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>Again, as to the devastation of Hellenic territory or the burning of 
<A NAME="973"></A>houses, what is to be the practice?
<A NAME="974"></A><BR><BR>May I have the pleasure, he said, of hearing your 
<A NAME="975"></A>opinion?
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>Both should be forbidden, in my judgment; I would take the annual produce 
<A NAME="977"></A>and no more. Shall I tell you why?
<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR>Pray do.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>Why, you see, there is a difference in the names 'discord' and 'war,' 
<A NAME="980"></A>and I imagine that there is also a difference in their natures; the one 
<A NAME="981"></A>is expressive of what is internal and domestic, the other of what is external 
<A NAME="982"></A>and foreign; and the first of the two is termed discord, and only the second, 
<A NAME="983"></A>war.
<A NAME="984"></A><BR><BR>That is a very proper distinction, he replied.
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>And may I not observe with equal propriety that the Hellenic race is 
<A NAME="986"></A>all united together by ties of blood and friendship, and alien and strange 
<A NAME="987"></A>to the barbarians?
<A NAME="988"></A><BR><BR>Very good, he said.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>And therefore when Hellenes fight with barbarians and barbarians with 
<A NAME="990"></A>Hellenes, they will be described by us as being at war when they fight, 
<A NAME="991"></A>and by nature enemies, and this kind of antagonism should be called war; 
<A NAME="992"></A>but when Hellenes fight with one another we shall say that Hellas is then 
<A NAME="993"></A>in a state of disorder and discord, they being by nature friends and such 
<A NAME="994"></A>enmity is to be called discord.
<A NAME="995"></A><BR><BR>I agree.
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>Consider then, I said, when that which we have acknowledged to be discord 
<A NAME="997"></A>occurs, and a city is divided, if both parties destroy the lands and burn 
<A NAME="998"></A>the houses of one another, how wicked does the strife appear! No true lover 
<A NAME="999"></A>of his country would bring himself to tear in pieces his own nurse and 
<A NAME="1000"></A>mother: There might be reason in the conqueror depriving the conquered 
<A NAME="1001"></A>of their harvest, but still they would have the idea of peace in their 
<A NAME="1002"></A>hearts and would not mean to go on fighting for ever.
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that is a better temper than the 
<A NAME="1004"></A>other.
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>And will not the city, which you are founding, be an Hellenic 
<A NAME="1006"></A>city?
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>It ought to be, he replied.
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>Then will not the citizens be good and civilized?
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>Yes, very civilized.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>And will they not be lovers of Hellas, and think of Hellas as their 
<A NAME="1011"></A>own land, and share in the common temples?
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR><BR>Most certainly.
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>And any difference which arises among them will be regarded by them 
<A NAME="1014"></A>as discord only --a quarrel among friends, which is not to be called a 
<A NAME="1015"></A>war?
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>Then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled? 
<A NAME="1018"></A>Certainly.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR><BR>They will use friendly correction, but will not enslave or destroy 
<A NAME="1020"></A>their opponents; they will be correctors, not enemies?
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR><BR>Just so.
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>And as they are Hellenes themselves they will not devastate Hellas, 
<A NAME="1023"></A>nor will they burn houses, not even suppose that the whole population of 
<A NAME="1024"></A>a city --men, women, and children --are equally their enemies, for they 
<A NAME="1025"></A>know that the guilt of war is always confined to a few persons and that 
<A NAME="1026"></A>the many are their friends. And for all these reasons they will be unwilling 
<A NAME="1027"></A>to waste their lands and raze their houses; their enmity to them will only 
<A NAME="1028"></A>last until the many innocent sufferers have compelled the guilty few to 
<A NAME="1029"></A>give satisfaction?
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR><BR>I agree, he said, that our citizens should thus deal with their 
<A NAME="1031"></A>Hellenic enemies; and with barbarians as the Hellenes now deal with one 
<A NAME="1032"></A>another.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR><BR>Then let us enact this law also for our guardians:-that they are 
<A NAME="1034"></A>neither to devastate the lands of Hellenes nor to burn their 
<A NAME="1035"></A>houses.
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR><BR>Agreed; and we may agree also in thinking that these, all our previous 
<A NAME="1037"></A>enactments, are very good.
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR><BR>But still I must say, Socrates, that if you are allowed to go on 
<A NAME="1039"></A>in this way you will entirely forget the other question which at the commencement 
<A NAME="1040"></A>of this discussion you thrust aside: --Is such an order of things possible, 
<A NAME="1041"></A>and how, if at all? For I am quite ready to acknowledge that the plan which 
<A NAME="1042"></A>you propose, if only feasible, would do all sorts of good to the State. 
<A NAME="1043"></A>I will add, what you have omitted, that your citizens will be the bravest 
<A NAME="1044"></A>of warriors, and will never leave their ranks, for they will all know one 
<A NAME="1045"></A>another, and each will call the other father, brother, son; and if you 
<A NAME="1046"></A>suppose the women to join their armies, whether in the same rank or in 
<A NAME="1047"></A>the rear, either as a terror to the enemy, or as auxiliaries in case of 
<A NAME="1048"></A>need, I know that they will then be absolutely invincible; and there are 
<A NAME="1049"></A>many domestic tic advantages which might also be mentioned and which I 
<A NAME="1050"></A>also fully acknowledge: but, as I admit all these advantages and as many 
<A NAME="1051"></A>more as you please, if only this State of yours were to come into existence, 
<A NAME="1052"></A>we need say no more about them; assuming then the existence of the State, 
<A NAME="1053"></A>let us now turn to the question of possibility and ways and means --the 
<A NAME="1054"></A>rest may be left.
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR><BR>If I loiter for a moment, you instantly make a raid upon me, I 
<A NAME="1056"></A>said, and have no mercy; I have hardly escaped the first and second waves, 
<A NAME="1057"></A>and you seem not to be aware that you are now bringing upon me the third, 
<A NAME="1058"></A>which is the greatest and heaviest. When you have seen and heard the third 
<A NAME="1059"></A>wave, I think you be more considerate and will acknowledge that some fear 
<A NAME="1060"></A>and hesitation was natural respecting a proposal so extraordinary as that 
<A NAME="1061"></A>which I have now to state and investigate.
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR><BR>The more appeals of this sort which you make, he said, the more 
<A NAME="1063"></A>determined are we that you shall tell us how such a State is possible: 
<A NAME="1064"></A>speak out and at once.
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR><BR>Let me begin by reminding you that we found our way hither in the 
<A NAME="1066"></A>search after justice and injustice.
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR><BR>True, he replied; but what of that?
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>I was only going to ask whether, if we have discovered them, we are 
<A NAME="1069"></A>to require that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice; 
<A NAME="1070"></A>or may we be satisfied with an approximation, and the attainment in him 
<A NAME="1071"></A>of a higher degree of justice than is to be found in other 
<A NAME="1072"></A>men?
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR><BR>The approximation will be enough.
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>We are enquiring into the nature of absolute justice and into the character 
<A NAME="1075"></A>of the perfectly just, and into injustice and the perfectly unjust, that 
<A NAME="1076"></A>we might have an ideal. We were to look at these in order that we might 
<A NAME="1077"></A>judge of our own happiness and unhappiness according to the standard which 
<A NAME="1078"></A>they exhibited and the degree in which we resembled them, but not with 
<A NAME="1079"></A>any view of showing that they could exist in fact.
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>Would a painter be any the worse because, after having delineated with 
<A NAME="1082"></A>consummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man, he was unable to 
<A NAME="1083"></A>show that any such man could ever have existed?
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR><BR>He would be none the worse.
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>Well, and were we not creating an ideal of a perfect 
<A NAME="1086"></A>State?
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>To be sure.
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>And is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to prove the 
<A NAME="1089"></A>possibility of a city being ordered in the manner described?
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR><BR>Surely not, he replied.
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>That is the truth, I said. But if, at your request, I am to try and 
<A NAME="1092"></A>show how and under what conditions the possibility is highest, I must ask 
<A NAME="1093"></A>you, having this in view, to repeat your former admissions.
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR><BR>What admissions?
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>I want to know whether ideals are ever fully realised in language? 
<A NAME="1096"></A>Does not the word express more than the fact, and must not the actual, 
<A NAME="1097"></A>whatever a man may think, always, in the nature of things, fall short of 
<A NAME="1098"></A>the truth? What do you say?
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR><BR>I agree.
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>Then you must not insist on my proving that the actual State will in 
<A NAME="1101"></A>every respect coincide with the ideal: if we are only able to discover 
<A NAME="1102"></A>how a city may be governed nearly as we proposed, you will admit that we 
<A NAME="1103"></A>have discovered the possibility which you demand; and will be contented. 
<A NAME="1104"></A>I am sure that I should be contented --will not you?
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I will.
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>Let me next endeavour to show what is that fault in States which is 
<A NAME="1107"></A>the cause of their present maladministration, and what is the least change 
<A NAME="1108"></A>which will enable a State to pass into the truer form; and let the change, 
<A NAME="1109"></A>if possible, be of one thing only, or if not, of two; at any rate, let 
<A NAME="1110"></A>the changes be as few and slight as possible.
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he replied.
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>I think, I said, that there might be a reform of the State if only 
<A NAME="1113"></A>one change were made, which is not a slight or easy though still a possible 
<A NAME="1114"></A>one.
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR><BR>What is it? he said.
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>Now then, I said, I go to meet that which I liken to the greatest of 
<A NAME="1117"></A>the waves; yet shall the word be spoken, even though the wave break and 
<A NAME="1118"></A>drown me in laughter and dishonour; and do you mark my 
<A NAME="1119"></A>words.
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR><BR>Proceed.
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>I said: Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this 
<A NAME="1122"></A>world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political greatness 
<A NAME="1123"></A>and wisdom meet in one, and those commoner natures who pursue either to 
<A NAME="1124"></A>the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside, cities will never 
<A NAME="1125"></A>have rest from their evils, --nor the human race, as I believe, --and then 
<A NAME="1126"></A>only will this our State have a possibility of life and behold the light 
<A NAME="1127"></A>of day. Such was the thought, my dear Glaucon, which I would fain have 
<A NAME="1128"></A>uttered if it had not seemed too extravagant; for to be convinced that 
<A NAME="1129"></A>in no other State can there be happiness private or public is indeed a 
<A NAME="1130"></A>hard thing.
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR><BR>Socrates, what do you mean? I would have you consider that the 
<A NAME="1132"></A>word which you have uttered is one at which numerous persons, and very 
<A NAME="1133"></A>respectable persons too, in a figure pulling off their coats all in a moment, 
<A NAME="1134"></A>and seizing any weapon that comes to hand, will run at you might and main, 
<A NAME="1135"></A>before you know where you are, intending to do heaven knows what; and if 
<A NAME="1136"></A>you don't prepare an answer, and put yourself in motion, you will be prepared 
<A NAME="1137"></A>by their fine wits,' and no mistake.
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR><BR>You got me into the scrape, I said.
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>And I was quite right; however, I will do all I can to get you out 
<A NAME="1140"></A>of it; but I can only give you good-will and good advice, and, perhaps, 
<A NAME="1141"></A>I may be able to fit answers to your questions better than another --that 
<A NAME="1142"></A>is all. And now, having such an auxiliary, you must do your best to show 
<A NAME="1143"></A>the unbelievers that you are right.
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR><BR>I ought to try, I said, since you offer me such invaluable assistance. 
<A NAME="1145"></A>And I think that, if there is to be a chance of our escaping, we must explain 
<A NAME="1146"></A>to them whom we mean when we say that philosophers are to rule in the State; 
<A NAME="1147"></A>then we shall be able to defend ourselves: There will be discovered to 
<A NAME="1148"></A>be some natures who ought to study philosophy and to be leaders in the 
<A NAME="1149"></A>State; and others who are not born to be philosophers, and are meant to 
<A NAME="1150"></A>be followers rather than leaders.
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR><BR>Then now for a definition, he said.
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR>Follow me, I said, and I hope that I may in some way or other be able 
<A NAME="1153"></A>to give you a satisfactory explanation.
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR><BR>Proceed.
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>I dare say that you remember, and therefore I need not remind you, 
<A NAME="1156"></A>that a lover, if lie is worthy of the name, ought to show his love, not 
<A NAME="1157"></A>to some one part of that which he loves, but to the 
<A NAME="1158"></A>whole.
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR><BR>I really do not understand, and therefore beg of you to assist 
<A NAME="1160"></A>my memory.
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR><BR>Another person, I said, might fairly reply as you do; but a man 
<A NAME="1162"></A>of pleasure like yourself ought to know that all who are in the flower 
<A NAME="1163"></A>of youth do somehow or other raise a pang or emotion in a lover's breast, 
<A NAME="1164"></A>and are thought by him to be worthy of his affectionate regards. Is not 
<A NAME="1165"></A>this a way which you have with the fair: one has a snub nose, and you praise 
<A NAME="1166"></A>his charming face; the hook-nose of another has, you say, a royal look; 
<A NAME="1167"></A>while he who is neither snub nor hooked has the grace of regularity: the 
<A NAME="1168"></A>dark visage is manly, the fair are children of the gods; and as to the 
<A NAME="1169"></A>sweet 'honey pale,' as they are called, what is the very name but the invention 
<A NAME="1170"></A>of a lover who talks in diminutives, and is not adverse to paleness if 
<A NAME="1171"></A>appearing on the cheek of youth? In a word, there is no excuse which you 
<A NAME="1172"></A>will not make, and nothing which you will not say, in order not to lose 
<A NAME="1173"></A>a single flower that blooms in the spring-time of youth.
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR><BR>If you make me an authority in matters of love, for the sake of 
<A NAME="1175"></A>the argument, I assent.
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR><BR>And what do you say of lovers of wine? Do you not see them doing 
<A NAME="1177"></A>the same? They are glad of any pretext of drinking any 
<A NAME="1178"></A>wine.
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR><BR>Very good.
<A NAME="1180"></A><BR>And the same is true of ambitious men; if they cannot command an army, 
<A NAME="1181"></A>they are willing to command a file; and if they cannot be honoured by really 
<A NAME="1182"></A>great and important persons, they are glad to be honoured by lesser and 
<A NAME="1183"></A>meaner people, but honour of some kind they must have.
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR>Once more let me ask: Does he who desires any class of goods, desire 
<A NAME="1186"></A>the whole class or a part only?
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR><BR>The whole.
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR>And may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover, not of a 
<A NAME="1189"></A>part of wisdom only, but of the whole?
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR><BR>Yes, of the whole.
<A NAME="1191"></A><BR>And he who dislikes learnings, especially in youth, when he has no 
<A NAME="1192"></A>power of judging what is good and what is not, such an one we maintain 
<A NAME="1193"></A>not to be a philosopher or a lover of knowledge, just as he who refuses 
<A NAME="1194"></A>his food is not hungry, and may be said to have a bad appetite and not 
<A NAME="1195"></A>a good one?
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR>Whereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is curious 
<A NAME="1198"></A>to learn and is never satisfied, may be justly termed a philosopher? Am 
<A NAME="1199"></A>I not right?
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR><BR>Glaucon said: If curiosity makes a philosopher, you will find many 
<A NAME="1201"></A>a strange being will have a title to the name. All the lovers of sights 
<A NAME="1202"></A>have a delight in learning, and must therefore be included. Musical amateurs, 
<A NAME="1203"></A>too, are a folk strangely out of place among philosophers, for they are 
<A NAME="1204"></A>the last persons in the world who would come to anything like a philosophical 
<A NAME="1205"></A>discussion, if they could help, while they run about at the Dionysiac festivals 
<A NAME="1206"></A>as if they had let out their ears to hear every chorus; whether the performance 
<A NAME="1207"></A>is in town or country --that makes no difference --they are there. Now 
<A NAME="1208"></A>are we to maintain that all these and any who have similar tastes, as well 
<A NAME="1209"></A>as the professors of quite minor arts, are philosophers?
<A NAME="1210"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not, I replied; they are only an imitation.
<A NAME="1211"></A><BR>He said: Who then are the true philosophers?
<A NAME="1212"></A><BR>Those, I said, who are lovers of the vision of truth.
<A NAME="1213"></A><BR>That is also good, he said; but I should like to know what you 
<A NAME="1214"></A>mean?
<A NAME="1215"></A><BR>To another, I replied, I might have a difficulty in explaining; but 
<A NAME="1216"></A>I am sure that you will admit a proposition which I am about to 
<A NAME="1217"></A>make.
<A NAME="1218"></A><BR><BR>What is the proposition?
<A NAME="1219"></A><BR>That since beauty is the opposite of ugliness, they are 
<A NAME="1220"></A>two?
<A NAME="1221"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1222"></A><BR>And inasmuch as they are two, each of them is one?
<A NAME="1223"></A><BR>True again.
<A NAME="1224"></A><BR>And of just and unjust, good and evil, and of every other class, the 
<A NAME="1225"></A>same remark holds: taken singly, each of them one; but from the various 
<A NAME="1226"></A>combinations of them with actions and things and with one another, they 
<A NAME="1227"></A>are seen in all sorts of lights and appear many? Very 
<A NAME="1228"></A>true.
<A NAME="1229"></A><BR><BR>And this is the distinction which I draw between the sight-loving, 
<A NAME="1230"></A>art-loving, practical class and those of whom I am speaking, and who are 
<A NAME="1231"></A>alone worthy of the name of philosophers.
<A NAME="1232"></A><BR><BR>How do you distinguish them? he said.
<A NAME="1233"></A><BR>The lovers of sounds and sights, I replied, are, as I conceive, fond 
<A NAME="1234"></A>of fine tones and colours and forms and all the artificial products that 
<A NAME="1235"></A>are made out of them, but their mind is incapable of seeing or loving absolute 
<A NAME="1236"></A>beauty.
<A NAME="1237"></A><BR><BR>True, he replied.
<A NAME="1238"></A><BR>Few are they who are able to attain to the sight of 
<A NAME="1239"></A>this.
<A NAME="1240"></A><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="1241"></A><BR>And he who, having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute 
<A NAME="1242"></A>beauty, or who, if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty is unable 
<A NAME="1243"></A>to follow --of such an one I ask, Is he awake or in a dream only? Reflect: 
<A NAME="1244"></A>is not the dreamer, sleeping or waking, one who likens dissimilar things, 
<A NAME="1245"></A>who puts the copy in the place of the real object?
<A NAME="1246"></A><BR><BR>I should certainly say that such an one was 
<A NAME="1247"></A>dreaming.
<A NAME="1248"></A><BR>But take the case of the other, who recognises the existence of absolute 
<A NAME="1249"></A>beauty and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects which participate 
<A NAME="1250"></A>in the idea, neither putting the objects in the place of the idea nor the 
<A NAME="1251"></A>idea in the place of the objects --is he a dreamer, or is he 
<A NAME="1252"></A>awake?
<A NAME="1253"></A><BR><BR>He is wide awake.
<A NAME="1254"></A><BR>And may we not say that the mind of the one who knows has knowledge, 
<A NAME="1255"></A>and that the mind of the other, who opines only, has 
<A NAME="1256"></A>opinion
<A NAME="1257"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1258"></A><BR>But suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our 
<A NAME="1259"></A>statement, can we administer any soothing cordial or advice to him, without 
<A NAME="1260"></A>revealing to him that there is sad disorder in his wits?
<A NAME="1261"></A><BR><BR>We must certainly offer him some good advice, he 
<A NAME="1262"></A>replied.
<A NAME="1263"></A><BR>Come, then, and let us think of something to say to him. Shall we begin 
<A NAME="1264"></A>by assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have, 
<A NAME="1265"></A>and that we are rejoiced at his having it? But we should like to ask him 
<A NAME="1266"></A>a question: Does he who has knowledge know something or nothing? (You must 
<A NAME="1267"></A>answer for him.)
<A NAME="1268"></A><BR><BR>I answer that he knows something.
<A NAME="1269"></A><BR>Something that is or is not?
<A NAME="1270"></A><BR>Something that is; for how can that which is not ever be 
<A NAME="1271"></A>known?
<A NAME="1272"></A><BR>And are we assured, after looking at the matter from many points of 
<A NAME="1273"></A>view, that absolute being is or may be absolutely known, but that the utterly 
<A NAME="1274"></A>non-existent is utterly unknown?
<A NAME="1275"></A><BR><BR>Nothing can be more certain.
<A NAME="1276"></A><BR><B>Good.</B> But if there be anything which is of such a nature as 
<A NAME="1277"></A>to be and not to be, that will have a place intermediate between pure being 
<A NAME="1278"></A>and the absolute negation of being?
<A NAME="1279"></A><BR><BR>Yes, between them.
<A NAME="1280"></A><BR>And, as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity 
<A NAME="1281"></A>to not-being, for that intermediate between being and not-being there has 
<A NAME="1282"></A>to be discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance and knowledge, 
<A NAME="1283"></A>if there be such?
<A NAME="1284"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1285"></A><BR>Do we admit the existence of opinion?
<A NAME="1286"></A><BR>Undoubtedly.
<A NAME="1287"></A><BR>As being the same with knowledge, or another faculty?
<A NAME="1288"></A><BR>Another faculty.
<A NAME="1289"></A><BR>Then opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter 
<A NAME="1290"></A>corresponding to this difference of faculties?
<A NAME="1291"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1292"></A><BR>And knowledge is relative to being and knows being. But before I proceed 
<A NAME="1293"></A>further I will make a division.
<A NAME="1294"></A><BR><BR>What division?
<A NAME="1295"></A><BR>I will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves: they are 
<A NAME="1296"></A>powers in us, and in all other things, by which we do as we do. Sight and 
<A NAME="1297"></A>hearing, for example, I should call faculties. Have I clearly explained 
<A NAME="1298"></A>the class which I mean?
<A NAME="1299"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I quite understand.
<A NAME="1300"></A><BR>Then let me tell you my view about them. I do not see them, and therefore 
<A NAME="1301"></A>the distinctions of fire, colour, and the like, which enable me to discern 
<A NAME="1302"></A>the differences of some things, do not apply to them. In speaking of a 
<A NAME="1303"></A>faculty I think only of its sphere and its result; and that which has the 
<A NAME="1304"></A>same sphere and the same result I call the same faculty, but that which 
<A NAME="1305"></A>has another sphere and another result I call different. Would that be your 
<A NAME="1306"></A>way of speaking?
<A NAME="1307"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1308"></A><BR>And will you be so very good as to answer one more question? Would 
<A NAME="1309"></A>you say that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place 
<A NAME="1310"></A>it?
<A NAME="1311"></A><BR><BR>Certainly knowledge is a faculty, and the mightiest of all 
<A NAME="1312"></A>faculties.
<A NAME="1313"></A><BR><BR>And is opinion also a faculty?
<A NAME="1314"></A><BR>Certainly, he said; for opinion is that wi
