The Prison of Socrates.<BR></BLOCKQUOTE><HR SIZE="1" COLOR="990033" NOSHADE><BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR><B>Socrates.</B> WHY have you come at this hour, Crito? it must 
<A NAME="15"></A>be quite early.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR><B>Crito.</B> Yes, certainly.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What is the exact time?
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> The dawn is breaking.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I wonder the keeper of the prison would let you 
<A NAME="20"></A>in.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> He knows me because I often come, Socrates; moreover. 
<A NAME="22"></A>I have done him a kindness.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And are you only just come?
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> No, I came some time ago.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then why did you sit and say nothing, instead of awakening 
<A NAME="26"></A>me at once?
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Why, indeed, Socrates, I myself would rather not have 
<A NAME="28"></A>all this sleeplessness and sorrow. But I have been wondering at your peaceful 
<A NAME="29"></A>slumbers, and that was the reason why I did not awaken you, because I wanted 
<A NAME="30"></A>you to be out of pain. I have always thought you happy in the calmness 
<A NAME="31"></A>of your temperament; but never did I see the like of the easy, cheerful 
<A NAME="32"></A>way in which you bear this calamity.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why, Crito, when a man has reached my age he ought 
<A NAME="34"></A>not to be repining at the prospect of death.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> And yet other old men find themselves in similar misfortunes, 
<A NAME="36"></A>and age does not prevent them from repining.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That may be. But you have not told me why you come 
<A NAME="38"></A>at this early hour.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> I come to bring you a message which is sad and painful; 
<A NAME="40"></A>not, as I believe, to yourself but to all of us who are your friends, and 
<A NAME="41"></A>saddest of all to me.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What! I suppose that the ship has come from Delos, 
<A NAME="43"></A>on the arrival of which I am to die?
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> No, the ship has not actually arrived, but she will 
<A NAME="45"></A>probably be here to-day, as persons who have come from Sunium tell me that 
<A NAME="46"></A>they have left her there; and therefore to-morrow, Socrates, will be the 
<A NAME="47"></A>last day of your life.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Very well, Crito; if such is the will of God, I am 
<A NAME="49"></A>willing; but my belief is that there will be a delay of a 
<A NAME="50"></A>day.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Why do you say this?
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I will tell you. I am to die on the day after the arrival 
<A NAME="53"></A>of the ship?
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Yes; that is what the authorities 
<A NAME="55"></A>say.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But I do not think that the ship will be here until 
<A NAME="57"></A>to-morrow; this I gather from a vision which I had last night, or rather 
<A NAME="58"></A>only just now, when you fortunately allowed me to sleep.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> And what was the nature of the vision?
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> There came to me the likeness of a woman, fair and 
<A NAME="61"></A>comely, clothed in white raiment, who called to me and said: O 
<A NAME="62"></A>Socrates-
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>"The third day hence, to Phthia shalt thou go."
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> What a singular dream, Socrates!
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> There can be no doubt about the meaning Crito, I 
<A NAME="66"></A>think.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Yes: the meaning is only too clear. But, O! my beloved 
<A NAME="68"></A>Socrates, let me entreat you once more to take my advice and escape. For 
<A NAME="69"></A>if you die I shall not only lose a friend who can never be replaced, but 
<A NAME="70"></A>there is another evil: people who do not know you and me will believe that 
<A NAME="71"></A>I might have saved you if I had been willing to give money, but that I 
<A NAME="72"></A>did not care. Now, can there be a worse disgrace than this- that I should 
<A NAME="73"></A>be thought to value money more than the life of a friend? For the many 
<A NAME="74"></A>will not be persuaded that I wanted you to escape, and that you 
<A NAME="75"></A>refused.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But why, my dear Crito, should we care about the opinion 
<A NAME="77"></A>of the many? Good men, and they are the only persons who are worth considering, 
<A NAME="78"></A>will think of these things truly as they happened.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> But do you see. Socrates, that the opinion of the many 
<A NAME="80"></A>must be regarded, as is evident in your own case, because they can do the 
<A NAME="81"></A>very greatest evil to anyone who has lost their good 
<A NAME="82"></A>opinion?
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I only wish, Crito, that they could; for then they 
<A NAME="84"></A>could also do the greatest good, and that would be well. But the truth 
<A NAME="85"></A>is, that they can do neither good nor evil: they cannot make a man wise 
<A NAME="86"></A>or make him foolish; and whatever they do is the result of 
<A NAME="87"></A>chance.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Well, I will not dispute about that; but please to tell 
<A NAME="89"></A>me, Socrates, whether you are not acting out of regard to me and your other 
<A NAME="90"></A>friends: are you not afraid that if you escape hence we may get into trouble 
<A NAME="91"></A>with the informers for having stolen you away, and lose either the whole 
<A NAME="92"></A>or a great part of our property; or that even a worse evil may happen to 
<A NAME="93"></A>us? Now, if this is your fear, be at ease; for in order to save you, we 
<A NAME="94"></A>ought surely to run this or even a greater risk; be persuaded, then, and 
<A NAME="95"></A>do as I say.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, Crito, that is one fear which you mention, but 
<A NAME="97"></A>by no means the only one.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Fear not. There are persons who at no great cost are 
<A NAME="99"></A>willing to save you and bring you out of prison; and as for the informers, 
<A NAME="100"></A>you may observe that they are far from being exorbitant in their demands; 
<A NAME="101"></A>a little money will satisfy them. My means, which, as I am sure, are ample, 
<A NAME="102"></A>are at your service, and if you have a scruple about spending all mine, 
<A NAME="103"></A>here are strangers who will give you the use of theirs; and one of them, 
<A NAME="104"></A>Simmias the Theban, has brought a sum of money for this very purpose; and 
<A NAME="105"></A>Cebes and many others are willing to spend their money too. I say, therefore, 
<A NAME="106"></A>do not on that account hesitate about making your escape, and do not say, 
<A NAME="107"></A>as you did in the court, that you will have a difficulty in knowing what 
<A NAME="108"></A>to do with yourself if you escape. For men will love you in other places 
<A NAME="109"></A>to which you may go, and not in Athens only; there are friends of mine 
<A NAME="110"></A>in Thessaly, if you like to go to them, who will value and protect you, 
<A NAME="111"></A>and no Thessalian will give you any trouble. Nor can I think that you are 
<A NAME="112"></A>justified, Socrates, in betraying your own life when you might be saved; 
<A NAME="113"></A>this is playing into the hands of your enemies and destroyers; and moreover 
<A NAME="114"></A>I should say that you were betraying your children; for you might bring 
<A NAME="115"></A>them up and educate them; instead of which you go away and leave them, 
<A NAME="116"></A>and they will have to take their chance; and if they do not meet with the 
<A NAME="117"></A>usual fate of orphans, there will be small thanks to you. No man should 
<A NAME="118"></A>bring children into the world who is unwilling to persevere to the end 
<A NAME="119"></A>in their nurture and education. But you are choosing the easier part, as 
<A NAME="120"></A>I think, not the better and manlier, which would rather have become one 
<A NAME="121"></A>who professes virtue in all his actions, like yourself. And, indeed, I 
<A NAME="122"></A>am ashamed not only of you, but of us who are your friends, when I reflect 
<A NAME="123"></A>that this entire business of yours will be attributed to our want of courage. 
<A NAME="124"></A>The trial need never have come on, or might have been brought to another 
<A NAME="125"></A>issue; and the end of all, which is the crowning absurdity, will seem to 
<A NAME="126"></A>have been permitted by us, through cowardice and baseness, who might have 
<A NAME="127"></A>saved you, as you might have saved yourself, if we had been good for anything 
<A NAME="128"></A>(for there was no difficulty in escaping); and we did not see how disgraceful, 
<A NAME="129"></A>Socrates, and also miserable all this will be to us as well as to you. 
<A NAME="130"></A>Make your mind up then, or rather have your mind already made up, for the 
<A NAME="131"></A>time of deliberation is over, and there is only one thing to be done, which 
<A NAME="132"></A>must be done, if at all, this very night, and which any delay will render 
<A NAME="133"></A>all but impossible; I beseech you therefore, Socrates, to be persuaded 
<A NAME="134"></A>by me, and to do as I say.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Dear Crito, your zeal is invaluable, if a right one; 
<A NAME="136"></A>but if wrong, the greater the zeal the greater the evil; and therefore 
<A NAME="137"></A>we ought to consider whether these things shall be done or not. For I am 
<A NAME="138"></A>and always have been one of those natures who must be guided by reason, 
<A NAME="139"></A>whatever the reason may be which upon reflection appears to me to be the 
<A NAME="140"></A>best; and now that this fortune has come upon me, I cannot put away the 
<A NAME="141"></A>reasons which I have before given: the principles which I have hitherto 
<A NAME="142"></A>honored and revered I still honor, and unless we can find other and better 
<A NAME="143"></A>principles on the instant, I am certain not to agree with you; no, not 
<A NAME="144"></A>even if the power of the multitude could inflict many more imprisonments, 
<A NAME="145"></A>confiscations, deaths, frightening us like children with hobgoblin terrors. 
<A NAME="146"></A>But what will be the fairest way of considering the question? Shall I return 
<A NAME="147"></A>to your old argument about the opinions of men, some of which are to be 
<A NAME="148"></A>regarded, and others, as we were saying, are not to be regarded? Now were 
<A NAME="149"></A>we right in maintaining this before I was condemned? And has the argument 
<A NAME="150"></A>which was once good now proved to be talk for the sake of talking; in fact 
<A NAME="151"></A>an amusement only, and altogether vanity? That is what I want to consider 
<A NAME="152"></A>with your help, Crito: whether, under my present circumstances, the argument 
<A NAME="153"></A>appears to be in any way different or not; and is to be allowed by me or 
<A NAME="154"></A>disallowed. That argument, which, as I believe, is maintained by many who 
<A NAME="155"></A>assume to be authorities, was to the effect, as I was saying, that the 
<A NAME="156"></A>opinions of some men are to be regarded, and of other men not to be regarded. 
<A NAME="157"></A>Now you, Crito, are a disinterested person who are not going to die to-morrow- 
<A NAME="158"></A>at least, there is no human probability of this, and you are therefore 
<A NAME="159"></A>not liable to be deceived by the circumstances in which you are placed. 
<A NAME="160"></A>Tell me, then, whether I am right in saying that some opinions, and the 
<A NAME="161"></A>opinions of some men only, are to be valued, and other opinions, and the 
<A NAME="162"></A>opinions of other men, are not to be valued. I ask you whether I was right 
<A NAME="163"></A>in maintaining this?
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The good are to be regarded, and not the 
<A NAME="166"></A>bad?
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the opinions of the wise are good, and the opinions 
<A NAME="169"></A>of the unwise are evil?
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And what was said about another matter? Was the disciple 
<A NAME="172"></A>in gymnastics supposed to attend to the praise and blame and opinion of 
<A NAME="173"></A>every man, or of one man only- his physician or trainer, whoever that 
<A NAME="174"></A>was?
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Of one man only.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And he ought to fear the censure and welcome the praise 
<A NAME="177"></A>of that one only, and not of the many?
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> That is clear.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And he ought to live and train, and eat and drink in 
<A NAME="180"></A>the way which seems good to his single master who has understanding, rather 
<A NAME="181"></A>than according to the opinion of all other men put together?
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> True.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if he disobeys and disregards the opinion and approval 
<A NAME="184"></A>of the one, and regards the opinion of the many who have no understanding, 
<A NAME="185"></A>will he not suffer evil?
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Certainly he will.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And what will the evil be, whither tending and what 
<A NAME="188"></A>affcting, in the disobedient person?
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Clearly, affecting the body; that is what is destroyed 
<A NAME="190"></A>by the evil.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Very good; and is not this true, Crito, of other things 
<A NAME="192"></A>which we need not separately enumerate? In the matter of just and unjust, 
<A NAME="193"></A>fair and foul, good and evil, which are the subjects of our present consultation, 
<A NAME="194"></A>ought we to follow the opinion of the many and to fear them; or the opinion 
<A NAME="195"></A>of the one man who has understanding, and whom we ought to fear and reverence 
<A NAME="196"></A>more than all the rest of the world: and whom deserting we shall destroy 
<A NAME="197"></A>and injure that principle in us which may be assumed to be improved by 
<A NAME="198"></A>justice and deteriorated by injustice; is there not such a 
<A NAME="199"></A>principle?
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Certainly there is, Socrates.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Take a parallel instance; if, acting under the advice 
<A NAME="202"></A>of men who have no understanding, we destroy that which is improvable by 
<A NAME="203"></A>health and deteriorated by disease- when that has been destroyed, I say, 
<A NAME="204"></A>would life be worth having? And that is- the body?
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Could we live, having an evil and corrupted 
<A NAME="207"></A>body?
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And will life be worth having, if that higher part 
<A NAME="210"></A>of man be depraved, which is improved by justice and deteriorated by injustice? 
<A NAME="211"></A>Do we suppose that principle, whatever it may be in man, which has to do 
<A NAME="212"></A>with justice and injustice, to be inferior to the body?
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> More honored, then?
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Far more honored.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, my friend, we must not regard what the many say 
<A NAME="217"></A>of us: but what he, the one man who has understanding of just and unjust, 
<A NAME="218"></A>will say, and what the truth will say. And therefore you begin in error 
<A NAME="219"></A>when you suggest that we should regard the opinion of the many about just 
<A NAME="220"></A>and unjust, good and evil, honorable and dishonorable. Well, someone will 
<A NAME="221"></A>say, "But the many can kill us."
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Yes, Socrates; that will clearly be the 
<A NAME="223"></A>answer.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That is true; but still I find with surprise that the 
<A NAME="225"></A>old argument is, as I conceive, unshaken as ever. And I should like to 
<A NAME="226"></A>know Whether I may say the same of another proposition- that not life, 
<A NAME="227"></A>but a good life, is to be chiefly valued?
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Yes, that also remains.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And a good life is equivalent to a just and honorable 
<A NAME="230"></A>one- that holds also?
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Yes, that holds.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> From these premises I proceed to argue the question 
<A NAME="233"></A>whether I ought or ought not to try to escape without the consent of the 
<A NAME="234"></A>Athenians: and if I am clearly right in escaping, then I will make the 
<A NAME="235"></A>attempt; but if not, I will abstain. The other considerations which you 
<A NAME="236"></A>mention, of money and loss of character, and the duty of educating children, 
<A NAME="237"></A>are, I fear, only the doctrines of the multitude, who would be as ready 
<A NAME="238"></A>to call people to life, if they were able, as they are to put them to death- 
<A NAME="239"></A>and with as little reason. But now, since the argument has thus far prevailed, 
<A NAME="240"></A>the only question which remains to be considered is, whether we shall do 
<A NAME="241"></A>rightly either in escaping or in suffering others to aid in our escape 
<A NAME="242"></A>and paying them in money and thanks, or whether we shan not do rightly; 
<A NAME="243"></A>and if the latter, then death or any other calamity which may ensue on 
<A NAME="244"></A>my remaining here must not be allowed to enter into the 
<A NAME="245"></A>calculation.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> I think that you are right, Socrates; how then shall 
<A NAME="247"></A>we proceed?
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let us consider the matter together, and do you either 
<A NAME="249"></A>refute me if you can, and I will be convinced; or else cease, my dear friend, 
<A NAME="250"></A>from repeating to me that I ought to escape against the wishes of the Athenians: 
<A NAME="251"></A>for I am extremely desirous to be persuaded by you, but not against my 
<A NAME="252"></A>own better judgment. And now please to consider my first position, and 
<A NAME="253"></A>do your best to answer me.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> I will do my best.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Are we to say that we are never intentionally to do 
<A NAME="256"></A>wrong, or that in one way we ought and in another way we ought not to do 
<A NAME="257"></A>wrong, or is doing wrong always evil and dishonorable, as I was just now 
<A NAME="258"></A>saying, and as has been already acknowledged by us? Are all our former 
<A NAME="259"></A>admissions which were made within a few days to be thrown away? And have 
<A NAME="260"></A>we, at our age, been earnestly discoursing with one another all our life 
<A NAME="261"></A>long only to discover that we are no better than children? Or are we to 
<A NAME="262"></A>rest assured, in spite of the opinion of the many, and in spite of consequences 
<A NAME="263"></A>whether better or worse, of the truth of what was then said, that injustice 
<A NAME="264"></A>is always an evil and dishonor to him who acts unjustly? Shall we affirm 
<A NAME="265"></A>that?
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then we must do no wrong?
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Nor when injured injure in return, as the many imagine; 
<A NAME="270"></A>for we must injure no one at all?
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Clearly not.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Again, Crito, may we do evil?
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Surely not, Socrates.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And what of doing evil in return for evil, which is 
<A NAME="275"></A>the morality of the many-is that just or not?
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Not just.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> For doing evil to another is the same as injuring 
<A NAME="278"></A>him?
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then we ought not to retaliate or render evil for evil 
<A NAME="281"></A>to anyone, whatever evil we may have suffered from him. But I would have 
<A NAME="282"></A>you consider, Crito, whether you really mean what you are saying. For this 
<A NAME="283"></A>opinion has never been held, and never will be held, by any considerable 
<A NAME="284"></A>number of persons; and those who are agreed and those who are not agreed 
<A NAME="285"></A>upon this point have no common ground, and can only despise one another, 
<A NAME="286"></A>when they see how widely they differ. Tell me, then, whether you agree 
<A NAME="287"></A>with and assent to my first principle, that neither injury nor retaliation 
<A NAME="288"></A>nor warding off evil by evil is ever right. And shall that be the premise 
<A NAME="289"></A>of our agreement? Or do you decline and dissent from this? For this has 
<A NAME="290"></A>been of old and is still my opinion; but, if you are of another opinion, 
<A NAME="291"></A>let me hear what you have to say. If, however, you remain of the same mind 
<A NAME="292"></A>as formerly, I will proceed to the next step.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> You may proceed, for I have not changed my 
<A NAME="294"></A>mind.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then I will proceed to the next step, which may be 
<A NAME="296"></A>put in the form of a question: Ought a man to do what he admits to be right, 
<A NAME="297"></A>or ought he to betray the right?
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> He ought to do what he thinks right.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But if this is true, what is the application? In leaving 
<A NAME="300"></A>the prison against the will of the Athenians, do I wrong any? or rather 
<A NAME="301"></A>do I not wrong those whom I ought least to wrong? Do I not desert the principles 
<A NAME="302"></A>which were acknowledged by us to be just? What do you 
<A NAME="303"></A>say?
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> I cannot tell, Socrates, for I do not 
<A NAME="305"></A>know.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then consider the matter in this way: Imagine that 
<A NAME="307"></A>I am about to play truant (you may call the proceeding by any name which 
<A NAME="308"></A>you like), and the laws and the government come and interrogate me: "Tell 
<A NAME="309"></A>us, Socrates," they say; "what are you about? are you going by an act of 
<A NAME="310"></A>yours to overturn us- the laws and the whole State, as far as in you lies? 
<A NAME="311"></A>Do you imagine that a State can subsist and not be overthrown, in which 
<A NAME="312"></A>the decisions of law have no power, but are set aside and overthrown by 
<A NAME="313"></A>individuals?" What will be our answer, Crito, to these and the like words? 
<A NAME="314"></A>Anyone, and especially a clever rhetorician, will have a good deal to urge 
<A NAME="315"></A>about the evil of setting aside the law which requires a sentence to be 
<A NAME="316"></A>carried out; and we might reply, "Yes; but the State has injured us and 
<A NAME="317"></A>given an unjust sentence." Suppose I say that?
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> Very good, Socrates.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Soc. "And was that our agreement with you?" the law would sar, "or 
<A NAME="320"></A>were you to abide by the sentence of the State?" And if I were to express 
<A NAME="321"></A>astonishment at their saying this, the law would probably add: "Answer, 
<A NAME="322"></A>Socrates, instead of opening your eyes: you are in the habit of asking 
<A NAME="323"></A>and answering questions. Tell us what complaint you have to make against 
<A NAME="324"></A>us which justifies you in attempting to destroy us and the State? In the 
<A NAME="325"></A>first place did we not bring you into existence? Your father married your 
<A NAME="326"></A>mother by our aid and begat you. Say whether you have any objection to 
<A NAME="327"></A>urge against those of us who regulate marriage?" None, I should reply. 
<A NAME="328"></A>"Or against those of us who regulate the system of nurture and education 
<A NAME="329"></A>of children in which you were trained? Were not the laws, who have the 
<A NAME="330"></A>charge of this, right in commanding your father to train you in music and 
<A NAME="331"></A>gymnastic?" Right, I should reply. "Well, then, since you were brought 
<A NAME="332"></A>into the world and nurtured and educated by us, can you deny in the first 
<A NAME="333"></A>place that you are our child and slave, as your fathers were before you? 
<A NAME="334"></A>And if this is true you are not on equal terms with us; nor can you think 
<A NAME="335"></A>that you have a right to do to us what we are doing to you. Would you have 
<A NAME="336"></A>any right to strike or revile or do any other evil to a father or to your 
<A NAME="337"></A>master, if you had one, when you have been struck or reviled by him, or 
<A NAME="338"></A>received some other evil at his hands?- you would not say this? And because 
<A NAME="339"></A>we think right to destroy you, do you think that you have any right to 
<A NAME="340"></A>destroy us in return, and your country as far as in you lies? And will 
<A NAME="341"></A>you, O professor of true virtue, say that you are justified in this? Has 
<A NAME="342"></A>a philosopher like you failed to discover that our country is more to be 
<A NAME="343"></A>valued and higher and holier far than mother or father or any ancestor, 
<A NAME="344"></A>and more to be regarded in the eyes of the gods and of men of understanding? 
<A NAME="345"></A>also to be soothed, and gently and reverently entreated when angry, even 
<A NAME="346"></A>more than a father, and if not persuaded, obeyed? And when we are punished 
<A NAME="347"></A>by her, whether with imprisonment or stripes, the punishment is to be endured 
<A NAME="348"></A>in silence; and if she leads us to wounds or death in battle, thither we 
<A NAME="349"></A>follow as is right; neither may anyone yield or retreat or leave his rank, 
<A NAME="350"></A>but whether in battle or in a court of law, or in any other place, he must 
<A NAME="351"></A>do what his city and his country order him; or he must change their view 
<A NAME="352"></A>of what is just: and if he may do no violence to his father or mother, 
<A NAME="353"></A>much less may he do violence to his country." What answer shall we make 
<A NAME="354"></A>to this, Crito? Do the laws speak truly, or do they 
<A NAME="355"></A>not?
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> I think that they do.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then the laws will say: "Consider, Socrates, if this 
<A NAME="358"></A>is true, that in your present attempt you are going to do us wrong. For, 
<A NAME="359"></A>after having brought you into the world, and nurtured and educated you, 
<A NAME="360"></A>and given you and every other citizen a share in every good that we had 
<A NAME="361"></A>to give, we further proclaim and give the right to every Athenian, that 
<A NAME="362"></A>if he does not like us when he has come of age and has seen the ways of 
<A NAME="363"></A>the city, and made our acquaintance, he may go where he pleases and take 
<A NAME="364"></A>his goods with him; and none of us laws will forbid him or interfere with 
<A NAME="365"></A>him. Any of you who does not like us and the city, and who wants to go 
<A NAME="366"></A>to a colony or to any other city, may go where he likes, and take his goods 
<A NAME="367"></A>with him. But he who has experience of the manner in which we order justice 
<A NAME="368"></A>and administer the State, and still remains, has entered into an implied 
<A NAME="369"></A>contract that he will do as we command him. And he who disobeys us is, 
<A NAME="370"></A>as we maintain, thrice wrong: first, because in disobeying us he is disobeying 
<A NAME="371"></A>his parents; secondly, because we are the authors of his education; thirdly, 
<A NAME="372"></A>because he has made an agreement with us that he will duly obey our commands; 
<A NAME="373"></A>and he neither obeys them nor convinces us that our commands are wrong; 
<A NAME="374"></A>and we do not rudely impose them, but give him the alternative of obeying 
<A NAME="375"></A>or convincing us; that is what we offer and he does neither. These are 
<A NAME="376"></A>the sort of accusations to which, as we were saying, you, Socrates, will 
<A NAME="377"></A>be exposed if you accomplish your intentions; you, above all other Athenians." 
<A NAME="378"></A>Suppose I ask, why is this? they will justly retort upon me that I above 
<A NAME="379"></A>all other men have acknowledged the agreement. "There is clear proof," 
<A NAME="380"></A>they will say, "Socrates, that we and the city were not displeasing to 
<A NAME="381"></A>you. Of all Athenians you have been the most constant resident in the city, 
<A NAME="382"></A>which, as you never leave, you may be supposed to love. For you never went 
<A NAME="383"></A>out of the city either to see the games, except once when you went to the 
<A NAME="384"></A>Isthmus, or to any other place unless when you were on military service; 
<A NAME="385"></A>nor did you travel as other men do. Nor had you any curiosity to know other 
<A NAME="386"></A>States or their laws: your affections did not go beyond us and our State; 
<A NAME="387"></A>we were your especial favorites, and you acquiesced in our government of 
<A NAME="388"></A>you; and this is the State in which you begat your children, which is a 
<A NAME="389"></A>proof of your satisfaction. Moreover, you might, if you had liked, have 
<A NAME="390"></A>fixed the penalty at banishment in the course of the trial-the State which 
<A NAME="391"></A>refuses to let you go now would have let you go then. But you pretended 
<A NAME="392"></A>that you preferred death to exile, and that you were not grieved at death. 
<A NAME="393"></A>And now you have forgotten these fine sentiments, and pay no respect to 
<A NAME="394"></A>us, the laws, of whom you are the destroyer; and are doing what only a 
<A NAME="395"></A>miserable slave would do, running away and turning your back upon the compacts 
<A NAME="396"></A>and agreements which you made as a citizen. And first of all answer this 
<A NAME="397"></A>very question: Are we right in saying that you agreed to be governed according 
<A NAME="398"></A>to us in deed, and not in word only? Is that true or not?" How shall we 
<A NAME="399"></A>answer that, Crito? Must we not agree?
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> There is no help, Socrates.
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then will they not say: "You, Socrates, are breaking 
<A NAME="402"></A>the covenants and agreements which you made with us at your leisure, not 
<A NAME="403"></A>in any haste or under any compulsion or deception, but having had seventy 
<A NAME="404"></A>years to think of them, during which time you were at liberty to leave 
<A NAME="405"></A>the city, if we were not to your mind, or if our covenants appeared to 
<A NAME="406"></A>you to be unfair. You had your choice, and might have gone either to Lacedaemon 
<A NAME="407"></A>or Crete, which you often praise for their good government, or to some 
<A NAME="408"></A>other Hellenic or foreign State. Whereas you, above all other Athenians, 
<A NAME="409"></A>seemed to be so fond of the State, or, in other words, of us her laws (for 
<A NAME="410"></A>who would like a State that has no laws?), that you never stirred out of 
<A NAME="411"></A>her: the halt, the blind, the maimed, were not more stationary in her than 
<A NAME="412"></A>you were. And now you run away and forsake your agreements. Not so, Socrates, 
<A NAME="413"></A>if you will take our advice; do not make yourself ridiculous by escaping 
<A NAME="414"></A>out of the city.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>"For just consider, if you transgress and err in this sort of way, 
<A NAME="416"></A>what good will you do, either to yourself or to your friends? That your 
<A NAME="417"></A>friends will be driven into exile and deprived of citizenship, or will 
<A NAME="418"></A>lose their property, is tolerably certain; and you yourself, if you fly 
<A NAME="419"></A>to one of the neighboring cities, as, for example, Thebes or Megara, both 
<A NAME="420"></A>of which are well-governed cities, will come to them as an enemy, Socrates, 
<A NAME="421"></A>and their government will be against you, and all patriotic citizens will 
<A NAME="422"></A>cast an evil eye upon you as a subverter of the laws, and you will confirm 
<A NAME="423"></A>in the minds of the judges the justice of their own condemnation of you. 
<A NAME="424"></A>For he who is a corrupter of the laws is more than likely to be corrupter 
<A NAME="425"></A>of the young and foolish portion of mankind. Will you then flee from well-ordered 
<A NAME="426"></A>cities and virtuous men? and is existence worth having on these terms? 
<A NAME="427"></A>Or will you go to them without shame, and talk to them, Socrates? And what 
<A NAME="428"></A>will you say to them? What you say here about virtue and justice and institutions 
<A NAME="429"></A>and laws being the best things among men? Would that be decent of you? 
<A NAME="430"></A>Surely not. But if you go away from well-governed States to Crito's friends 
<A NAME="431"></A>in Thessaly, where there is great disorder and license, they will be charmed 
<A NAME="432"></A>to have the tale of your escape from prison, set off with ludicrous particulars 
<A NAME="433"></A>of the manner in which you were wrapped in a goatskin or some other disguise, 
<A NAME="434"></A>and metamorphosed as the fashion of runaways is- that is very likely; but 
<A NAME="435"></A>will there be no one to remind you that in your old age you violated the 
<A NAME="436"></A>most sacred laws from a miserable desire of a little more life? Perhaps 
<A NAME="437"></A>not, if you keep them in a good temper; but if they are out of temper you 
<A NAME="438"></A>will hear many degrading things; you will live, but how?- as the flatterer 
<A NAME="439"></A>of all men, and the servant of all men; and doing what?- eating and drinking 
<A NAME="440"></A>in Thessaly, having gone abroad in order that you may get a dinner. And 
<A NAME="441"></A>where will be your fine sentiments about justice and virtue then? Say that 
<A NAME="442"></A>you wish to live for the sake of your children, that you may bring them 
<A NAME="443"></A>up and educate them- will you take them into Thessaly and deprive them 
<A NAME="444"></A>of Athenian citizenship? Is that the benefit which you would confer upon 
<A NAME="445"></A>them? Or are you under the impression that they will be better cared for 
<A NAME="446"></A>and educated here if you are still alive, although absent from them; for 
<A NAME="447"></A>that your friends will take care of them? Do you fancy that if you are 
<A NAME="448"></A>an inhabitant of Thessaly they will take care of them, and if you are an 
<A NAME="449"></A>inhabitant of the other world they will not take care of them? Nay; but 
<A NAME="450"></A>if they who call themselves friends are truly friends, they surely 
<A NAME="451"></A>will.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>"Listen, then, Socrates, to us who have brought you up. Think not 
<A NAME="453"></A>of life and children first, and of justice afterwards, but of justice first, 
<A NAME="454"></A>that you may be justified before the princes of the world below. For neither 
<A NAME="455"></A>will you nor any that belong to you be happier or holier or juster in this 
<A NAME="456"></A>life, or happier in another, if you do as Crito bids. Now you depart in 
<A NAME="457"></A>innocence, a sufferer and not a doer of evil; a victim, not of the laws, 
<A NAME="458"></A>but of men. But if you go forth, returning evil for evil, and injury for 
<A NAME="459"></A>injury, breaking the covenants and agreements which you have made with 
<A NAME="460"></A>us, and wronging those whom you ought least to wrong, that is to say, yourself, 
<A NAME="461"></A>your friends, your country, and us, we shall be angry with you while you 
<A NAME="462"></A>live, and our brethren, the laws in the world below, will receive you as 
<A NAME="463"></A>an enemy; for they will know that you have done your best to destroy us. 
<A NAME="464"></A>Listen, then, to us and not to Crito."
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>This is the voice which I seem to hear murmuring in my ears, like 
<A NAME="466"></A>the sound of the flute in the ears of the mystic; that voice, I say, is 
<A NAME="467"></A>humming in my ears, and prevents me from hearing any other. And I know 
<A NAME="468"></A>that anything more which you will say will be in vain. Yet speak, if you 
<A NAME="469"></A>have anything to say.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR><B>Cr.</B> I have nothing to say, Socrates.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then let me follow the intimations of the will of 
<A NAME="472"></A>God.
