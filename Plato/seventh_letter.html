<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Plato TO THE RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OF DION. WELFARE.
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>You write to me that I must consider your views the same as those 
<A NAME="12"></A>of Dion, and you urge me to aid your cause so far as I can in word and 
<A NAME="13"></A>deed. My answer is that, if you have the same opinion and desire as he 
<A NAME="14"></A>had, I consent to aid your cause; but if not, I shall think more than once 
<A NAME="15"></A>about it. Now what his purpose and desire was, I can inform you from no 
<A NAME="16"></A>mere conjecture but from positive knowledge. For when I made my first visit 
<A NAME="17"></A>to Sicily, being then about forty years old, Dion was of the same age as 
<A NAME="18"></A>Hipparinos is now, and the opinion which he then formed was that which 
<A NAME="19"></A>he always retained, I mean the belief that the Syracusans ought to be free 
<A NAME="20"></A>and governed by the best laws. So it is no matter for surprise if some 
<A NAME="21"></A>God should make Hipparinos adopt the same opinion as Dion about forms of 
<A NAME="22"></A>government. But it is well worth while that you should all, old as well 
<A NAME="23"></A>as young, hear the way in which this opinion was formed, and I will attempt 
<A NAME="24"></A>to give you an account of it from the beginning. For the present is a suitable 
<A NAME="25"></A>opportunity.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>In my youth I went through the same experience as many other men. 
<A NAME="27"></A>I fancied that if, early in life, I became my own master, I should at once 
<A NAME="28"></A>embark on a political career. And I found myself confronted with the following 
<A NAME="29"></A>occurrences in the public affairs of my own city. The existing constitution 
<A NAME="30"></A>being generally condemned, a revolution took place, and fifty-one men came 
<A NAME="31"></A>to the front as rulers of the revolutionary government, namely eleven in 
<A NAME="32"></A>the city and ten in the Peiraeus-each of these bodies being in charge of 
<A NAME="33"></A>the market and municipal matters-while thirty were appointed rulers with 
<A NAME="34"></A>full powers over public affairs as a whole. Some of these were relatives 
<A NAME="35"></A>and acquaintances of mine, and they at once invited me to share in their 
<A NAME="36"></A>doings, as something to which I had a claim. The effect on me was not surprising 
<A NAME="37"></A>in the case of a young man. I considered that they would, of course, so 
<A NAME="38"></A>manage the State as to bring men out of a bad way of life into a good one. 
<A NAME="39"></A>So I watched them very closely to see what they would 
<A NAME="40"></A>do.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>And seeing, as I did, that in quite a short time they made the 
<A NAME="42"></A>former government seem by comparison something precious as gold-for among 
<A NAME="43"></A>other things they tried to send a friend of mine, the aged Socrates, whom 
<A NAME="44"></A>I should scarcely scruple to describe as the most upright man of that day, 
<A NAME="45"></A>with some other persons to carry off one of the citizens by force to execution, 
<A NAME="46"></A>in order that, whether he wished it, or not, he might share the guilt of 
<A NAME="47"></A>their conduct; but he would not obey them, risking all consequences in 
<A NAME="48"></A>preference to becoming a partner in their iniquitous deeds-seeing all these 
<A NAME="49"></A>things and others of the same kind on a considerable scale, I disapproved 
<A NAME="50"></A>of their proceedings, and withdrew from any connection with the abuses 
<A NAME="51"></A>of the time.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>Not long after that a revolution terminated the power of the thirty 
<A NAME="53"></A>and the form of government as it then was. And once more, though with more 
<A NAME="54"></A>hesitation, I began to be moved by the desire to take part in public and 
<A NAME="55"></A>political affairs. Well, even in the new government, unsettled as it was, 
<A NAME="56"></A>events occurred which one would naturally view with disapproval; and it 
<A NAME="57"></A>was not surprising that in a period of revolution excessive penalties were 
<A NAME="58"></A>inflicted by some persons on political opponents, though those who had 
<A NAME="59"></A>returned from exile at that time showed very considerable forbearance. 
<A NAME="60"></A>But once more it happened that some of those in power brought my friend 
<A NAME="61"></A>Socrates, whom I have mentioned, to trial before a court of law, laying 
<A NAME="62"></A>a most iniquitous charge against him and one most inappropriate in his 
<A NAME="63"></A>case: for it was on a charge of impiety that some of them prosecuted and 
<A NAME="64"></A>others condemned and executed the very man who would not participate in 
<A NAME="65"></A>the iniquitous arrest of one of the friends of the party then in exile, 
<A NAME="66"></A>at the time when they themselves were in exile and misfortune.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>As I observed these incidents and the men engaged in public affairs, 
<A NAME="68"></A>the laws too and the customs, the more closely I examined them and the 
<A NAME="69"></A>farther I advanced in life, the more difficult it seemed to me to handle 
<A NAME="70"></A>public affairs aright. For it was not possible to be active in politics 
<A NAME="71"></A>without friends and trustworthy supporters; and to find these ready to 
<A NAME="72"></A>my hand was not an easy matter, since public affairs at Athens were not 
<A NAME="73"></A>carried on in accordance with the manners and practices of our fathers; 
<A NAME="74"></A>nor was there any ready method by which I could make new friends. The laws 
<A NAME="75"></A>too, written and unwritten, were being altered for the worse, and the evil 
<A NAME="76"></A>was growing with startling rapidity. The result was that, though at first 
<A NAME="77"></A>I had been full of a strong impulse towards political life, as I looked 
<A NAME="78"></A>at the course of affairs and saw them being swept in all directions by 
<A NAME="79"></A>contending currents, my head finally began to swim; and, though I did not 
<A NAME="80"></A>stop looking to see if there was any likelihood of improvement in these 
<A NAME="81"></A>symptoms and in the general course of public life, I postponed action till 
<A NAME="82"></A>a suitable opportunity should arise. Finally, it became clear to me, with 
<A NAME="83"></A>regard to all existing cornmunities, that they were one and all misgoverned. 
<A NAME="84"></A>For their laws have got into a state that is almost incurable, except by 
<A NAME="85"></A>some extraordinary reform with good luck to support it. And I was forced 
<A NAME="86"></A>to say, when praising true philosophy that it is by this that men are enabled 
<A NAME="87"></A>to see what justice in public and private life really is. Therefore, I 
<A NAME="88"></A>said, there will be no cessation of evils for the sons of men, till either 
<A NAME="89"></A>those who are pursuing a right and true philosophy receive sovereign power 
<A NAME="90"></A>in the States, or those in power in the States by some dispensation of 
<A NAME="91"></A>providence become true philosophers.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>With these thoughts in my mind I came to Italy and Sicily on my 
<A NAME="93"></A>first visit. My first impressions on arrival were those of strong disapproval-disapproval 
<A NAME="94"></A>of the kind of life which was there called the life of happiness, stuffed 
<A NAME="95"></A>full as it was with the banquets of the Italian Greeks and Syracusans, 
<A NAME="96"></A>who ate to repletion twice every day, and were never without a partner 
<A NAME="97"></A>for the night; and disapproval of the habits which this manner of life 
<A NAME="98"></A>produces. For with these habits formed early in life, no man under heaven 
<A NAME="99"></A>could possibly attain to wisdom-human nature is not capable of such an 
<A NAME="100"></A>extraordinary combination. Temperance also is out of the question for such 
<A NAME="101"></A>a man; and the same applies to virtue generally. No city could remain in 
<A NAME="102"></A>a state of tranquillity under any laws whatsoever, when men think it right 
<A NAME="103"></A>to squander all their property in extravagant, and consider it a duty to 
<A NAME="104"></A>be idle in everything else except eating and drinking and the laborious 
<A NAME="105"></A>prosecution of debauchery. It follows necessarily that the constitutions 
<A NAME="106"></A>of such cities must be constantly changing, tyrannies, oligarchies and 
<A NAME="107"></A>democracies succeeding one another, while those who hold the power cannot 
<A NAME="108"></A>so much as endure the name of any form of government which maintains justice 
<A NAME="109"></A>and equality of rights.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>With a mind full of these thoughts, on the top of my previous convictions, 
<A NAME="111"></A>I crossed over to Syracuse-led there perhaps by chance-but it really looks 
<A NAME="112"></A>as if some higher power was even then planning to lay a foundation for 
<A NAME="113"></A>all that has now come to pass with regard to Dion and Syracuse-and for 
<A NAME="114"></A>further troubles too, I fear, unless you listen to the advice which is 
<A NAME="115"></A>now for the second time offered by me. What do I mean by saying that my 
<A NAME="116"></A>arrival in Sicily at that movement proved to be the foundation on which 
<A NAME="117"></A>all the sequel rests? I was brought into close intercourse with Dion who 
<A NAME="118"></A>was then a young man, and explained to him my views as to the ideals at 
<A NAME="119"></A>which men should aim, advising him to carry them out in practice. In doing 
<A NAME="120"></A>this I seem to have been unaware that I was, in a fashion, without knowing 
<A NAME="121"></A>it, contriving the overthrow of the tyranny which; subsequently took place. 
<A NAME="122"></A>For Dion, who rapidly assimilated my teaching as he did all forms of knowledge, 
<A NAME="123"></A>listened to me with an eagerness which I had never seen equalled in any 
<A NAME="124"></A>young man, and resolved to live for the future in a better way than the 
<A NAME="125"></A>majority of Italian and Sicilian Greeks, having set his affection on virtue 
<A NAME="126"></A>in preference to pleasure and self-indulgence. The result was that until 
<A NAME="127"></A>the death of Dionysios he lived in a way which rendered him somewhat unpopular 
<A NAME="128"></A>among those whose manner of life was that which is usual in the courts 
<A NAME="129"></A>of despots.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>After that event he came to the conclusion that this conviction, 
<A NAME="131"></A>which he himself had gained under the influence of good teaching, was not 
<A NAME="132"></A>likely to be confined to himself. Indeed, he saw it being actually implanted 
<A NAME="133"></A>in other minds-not many perhaps, but certainly in some; and he thought 
<A NAME="134"></A>that with the aid of the Gods, Dionysios might perhaps become one of these, 
<A NAME="135"></A>and that, if such a thing did come to pass, the result would be a life 
<A NAME="136"></A>of unspeakable happiness both for himself and for the rest of the Syracusans. 
<A NAME="137"></A>Further, he thought it essential that I should come to Syracuse by all 
<A NAME="138"></A>manner of means and with the utmost possible speed to be his partner in 
<A NAME="139"></A>these plans, remembering in his own case how readily intercourse with me 
<A NAME="140"></A>had produced in him a longing for the noblest and best life. And if it 
<A NAME="141"></A>should produce a similar effect on Dionysios, as his aim was that it should, 
<A NAME="142"></A>he had great hope that, without bloodshed, loss of life, and those disastrous 
<A NAME="143"></A>events which have now taken place, he would be able to introduce the true 
<A NAME="144"></A>life of happiness throughout the whole territory.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>Holding these sound views, Dion persuaded Dionysios to send for 
<A NAME="146"></A>me; he also wrote himself entreating me to come by all manner of means 
<A NAME="147"></A>and with the utmost possible speed, before certain other persons coming 
<A NAME="148"></A>in contact with Dionysios should turn him aside into some way of life other 
<A NAME="149"></A>than the best. What he said, though perhaps it is rather long to repeat, 
<A NAME="150"></A>was as follows: "What opportunities," he said, "shall we wait for, greater 
<A NAME="151"></A>than those now offered to us by Providence?" And he described the Syracusan 
<A NAME="152"></A>empire in Italy and Sicily, his own influential position in it, and the 
<A NAME="153"></A>youth of Dionysios and how strongly his desire was directed towards philosophy 
<A NAME="154"></A>and education. His own nephews and relatives, he said, would be readily 
<A NAME="155"></A>attracted towards the principles and manner of life described by me, and 
<A NAME="156"></A>would be most influential in attracting Dionysios in the same direction, 
<A NAME="157"></A>so that, now if ever, we should see the accomplishment of every hope that 
<A NAME="158"></A>the same persons might actually become both philosophers and the rulers 
<A NAME="159"></A>of great States. These were the appeals addressed to me and much more to 
<A NAME="160"></A>the same effect.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>My own opinion, so far as the young men were concerned, and the 
<A NAME="162"></A>probable line which their conduct would take, was full of apprehension-for 
<A NAME="163"></A>young men are quick in forming desires, which often take directions conflicting 
<A NAME="164"></A>with one another. But I knew that the character of Dion's mind was naturally 
<A NAME="165"></A>a stable one and had also the advantage of somewhat advanced 
<A NAME="166"></A>years.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>Therefore, I pondered the matter and was in two minds as to whether 
<A NAME="168"></A>I ought to listen to entreaties and go, or how I ought to act; and finally 
<A NAME="169"></A>the scale turned in favour of the view that, if ever anyone was to try 
<A NAME="170"></A>to carry out in practice my ideas about laws and constitutions, now was 
<A NAME="171"></A>the time for making the attempt; for if only I could fully convince one 
<A NAME="172"></A>man, I should have secured thereby the accomplishment of all good 
<A NAME="173"></A>things.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>With these views and thus nerved to the task, I sailed from home, 
<A NAME="175"></A>in the spirit which some imagined, but principally through a feeling of 
<A NAME="176"></A>shame with regard to myself, lest I might some day appear to myself wholly 
<A NAME="177"></A>and solely a mere man of words, one who would never of his own will lay 
<A NAME="178"></A>his hand to any act. Also there was reason to think that I should be betraying 
<A NAME="179"></A>first and foremost my friendship and comradeship with Dion, who in very 
<A NAME="180"></A>truth was in a position of considerable danger. If therefore anything should 
<A NAME="181"></A>happen to him, or if he were banished by Dionysios and his other enemies 
<A NAME="182"></A>and coming to us as exile addressed this question to me: "Plato, I have 
<A NAME="183"></A>come to you as a fugitive, not for want of hoplites, nor because I had 
<A NAME="184"></A>no cavalry for defence against my enemies, but for want of words and power 
<A NAME="185"></A>of persuasion, which I knew to be a special gift of yours, enabling you 
<A NAME="186"></A>to lead young men into the path of goodness and justice, and to establish 
<A NAME="187"></A>in every case relations of friendship and comradeship among them. It is 
<A NAME="188"></A>for the want of this assistance on your part that I have left Syracuse 
<A NAME="189"></A>and am here now. And the disgrace attaching to your treatment of me is 
<A NAME="190"></A>a small matter. But philosophy-whose praises you are always singing, while 
<A NAME="191"></A>you say she is held in dishonour by the rest of mankind-must we not say 
<A NAME="192"></A>that philosophy along with me has now been betrayed, so far as your action 
<A NAME="193"></A>was concerned? Had I been living at Megara, you would certainly have come 
<A NAME="194"></A>to give me your aid towards the objects for which I asked it; or you would 
<A NAME="195"></A>have thought yourself the most contemptible of mankind. But as it is, do 
<A NAME="196"></A>you think that you will escape the reputation of cowardice by making excuses 
<A NAME="197"></A>about the distance of the journey, the length of the sea voyage, and the 
<A NAME="198"></A>amount of labour involved? Far from it." To reproaches of this kind what 
<A NAME="199"></A>creditable reply could I have made? Surely none.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>I took my departure, therefore, acting, so far as a man can act, 
<A NAME="201"></A>in obedience to reason and justice, and for these reasons leaving my own 
<A NAME="202"></A>occupations, which were certainly not discreditable ones, to put myself 
<A NAME="203"></A>under a tyranny which did not seem likely to harmonise with my teaching 
<A NAME="204"></A>or with myself. By my departure I secured my own freedom from the displeasure 
<A NAME="205"></A>of Zeus Xenios, and made myself clear of any charge on the part of philosophy, 
<A NAME="206"></A>which would have been exposed to detraction, if any disgrace had come upon 
<A NAME="207"></A>me for faint-heartedness and cowardice.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>On my arrival, to cut a long story short, I found the court of 
<A NAME="209"></A>Dionysios full of intrigues and of attempts to create in the sovereign 
<A NAME="210"></A>ill-feeling against Dion. I combated these as far as I could, but with 
<A NAME="211"></A>very little success; and in the fourth month or thereabouts, charging Dion 
<A NAME="212"></A>with conspiracy to seize the throne, Dionysios put him on board a small 
<A NAME="213"></A>boat and expelled him from Syracuse with ignominy. All of us who were Dion's 
<A NAME="214"></A>friends were afraid that he might take vengeance on one or other of us 
<A NAME="215"></A>as an accomplice in Dion's conspiracy. With regard to me, there was even 
<A NAME="216"></A>a rumour current in Syracuse that I had been put to death by Dionysios 
<A NAME="217"></A>as the cause of all that had occurred. Perceiving that we were all in this 
<A NAME="218"></A>state of mind and apprehending that our fears might lead to some serious 
<A NAME="219"></A>consequence, he now tried to win all of us over by kindness: me in particular 
<A NAME="220"></A>he encouraged, bidding me be of good cheer and entreating me on all grounds 
<A NAME="221"></A>to remain. For my flight from him was not likely to redound to his credit, 
<A NAME="222"></A>but my staying might do so. Therefore, he made a great pretence of entreating 
<A NAME="223"></A>me. And we know that the entreaties of sovereigns are mixed with compulsion. 
<A NAME="224"></A>So to secure his object he proceeded to render my departure impossible, 
<A NAME="225"></A>bringing me into the acropolis, and establishing me in quarters from which 
<A NAME="226"></A>not a single ship's captain would have taken me away against the will of 
<A NAME="227"></A>Dionysios, nor indeed without a special messenger sent by him to order 
<A NAME="228"></A>my removal. Nor was there a single merchant, or a single official in charge 
<A NAME="229"></A>of points of departure from the country, who would have allowed me to depart 
<A NAME="230"></A>unaccompanied, and would not have promptly seized me and taken me back 
<A NAME="231"></A>to Dionysios, especially since a statement had now been circulated contradicting 
<A NAME="232"></A>the previous rumours and giving out that Dionysios was becoming extraordinarily 
<A NAME="233"></A>attached to Plato. What were the facts about this attachment? I must tell 
<A NAME="234"></A>the truth. As time went on, and as intercourse made him acquainted with 
<A NAME="235"></A>my disposition and character, he did become more and more attached to me, 
<A NAME="236"></A>and wished me to praise him more than I praised Dion, and to look upon 
<A NAME="237"></A>him as more specially my friend than Dion, and he was extraordinarily eager 
<A NAME="238"></A>about this sort of thing. But when confronted with the one way in which 
<A NAME="239"></A>this might have been done, if it was to be done at all, he shrank from 
<A NAME="240"></A>coming into close and intimate relations with me as a pupil and listener 
<A NAME="241"></A>to my discourses on philosophy, fearing the danger suggested by mischief-makers, 
<A NAME="242"></A>that he might be ensnared, and so Dion would prove to have accomplished 
<A NAME="243"></A>all his object. I endured all this patiently, retaining the purpose with 
<A NAME="244"></A>which I had come and the hope that he might come to desire the philosophic 
<A NAME="245"></A>life. But his resistance prevailed against me.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>The time of my first visit to Sicily and my stay there was taken 
<A NAME="247"></A>up with all these incidents. On a later occasion I left home and again 
<A NAME="248"></A>came on an urgent summons from Dionysios. But before giving the motives 
<A NAME="249"></A>and particulars of my conduct then and showing how suitable and right it 
<A NAME="250"></A>was, I must first, in order that I may not treat as the main point what 
<A NAME="251"></A>is only a side issue, give you my advice as to what your acts should be 
<A NAME="252"></A>in the present position of affairs; afterwards, to satisfy those who put 
<A NAME="253"></A>the question why I came a second time, I will deal fully with the facts 
<A NAME="254"></A>about my second visit; what I have now to say is this.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>He who advises a sick man, whose manner of life is prejudicial 
<A NAME="256"></A>to health, is clearly bound first of all to change his patient's manner 
<A NAME="257"></A>of life, and if the patient is willing to obey him, he may go on to give 
<A NAME="258"></A>him other advice. But if he is not willing, I shall consider one who declines 
<A NAME="259"></A>to advise such a patient to be a man and a physician, and one who gives 
<A NAME="260"></A>in to him to be unmanly and unprofessional. In the same way with regard 
<A NAME="261"></A>to a State, whether it be under a single ruler or more than one, if, while 
<A NAME="262"></A>the government is being carried on methodically and in a right course, 
<A NAME="263"></A>it asks advice about any details of policy, it is the part of a wise man 
<A NAME="264"></A>to advise such people. But when men are travelling altogether outside the 
<A NAME="265"></A>path of right government and flatly refuse to move in the right path, and 
<A NAME="266"></A>start by giving notice to their adviser that he must leave the government 
<A NAME="267"></A>alone and make no change in it under penalty of death-if such men should 
<A NAME="268"></A>order their counsellors to pander to their wishes and desires and to advise 
<A NAME="269"></A>them in what way their object may most readily and easily be once for all 
<A NAME="270"></A>accomplished, I should consider as unmanly one who accepts the duty of 
<A NAME="271"></A>giving such forms of advice, and one who refuses it to be a true 
<A NAME="272"></A>man.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>Holding these views, whenever anyone consults me about any of the 
<A NAME="274"></A>weightiest matters affecting his own life, as, for instance, the acquisition 
<A NAME="275"></A>of property or the proper treatment of body or mind, if it seems to me 
<A NAME="276"></A>that his daily life rests on any system, or if he seems likely to listen 
<A NAME="277"></A>to advice about the things on which he consults me, I advise him with readiness, 
<A NAME="278"></A>and do not content myself with giving him a merely perfunctory answer. 
<A NAME="279"></A>But if a man does not consult me at all, or evidently does not intend to 
<A NAME="280"></A>follow my advice, I do not take the initiative in advising such a man, 
<A NAME="281"></A>and will not use compulsion to him, even if he be my own son. I would advise 
<A NAME="282"></A>a slave under such circumstances, and would use compulsion to him if he 
<A NAME="283"></A>were unwilling. To a father or mother I do not think that piety allows 
<A NAME="284"></A>one to offer compulsion, unless they are suffering from an attack of insanity; 
<A NAME="285"></A>and if they are following any regular habits of life which please them 
<A NAME="286"></A>but do not please me, I would not offend them by offering useless, advice, 
<A NAME="287"></A>nor would I flatter them or truckle to them, providing them with the means 
<A NAME="288"></A>of satisfying desires which I myself would sooner die than cherish. The 
<A NAME="289"></A>wise man should go through life with the same attitude of mind towards 
<A NAME="290"></A>his country. If she should appear to him to be following a policy which 
<A NAME="291"></A>is not a good one, he should say so, provided that his words are not likely 
<A NAME="292"></A>either to fall on deaf ears or to lead to the loss of his own life. But 
<A NAME="293"></A>force against his native land he should not use in order to bring about 
<A NAME="294"></A>a change of constitution, when it is not possible for the best constitution 
<A NAME="295"></A>to be introduced without driving men into exile or putting them to death; 
<A NAME="296"></A>he should keep quiet and offer up prayers for his own welfare and for that 
<A NAME="297"></A>of his country.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>These are the principles in accordance with which I should advise 
<A NAME="299"></A>you, as also, jointly with Dion, I advised Dionysios, bidding him in the 
<A NAME="300"></A>first place to live his daily life in a way that would make him as far 
<A NAME="301"></A>as possible master of himself and able to gain faithful friends and supporters, 
<A NAME="302"></A>in order that he might not have the same experience as his father. For 
<A NAME="303"></A>his father, having taken under his rule many great cities of Sicily which 
<A NAME="304"></A>had been utterly destroyed by the barbarians, was not able to found them 
<A NAME="305"></A>afresh and to establish in them trustworthy governments carried on by his 
<A NAME="306"></A>own supporters, either by men who had no ties of blood with him, or by 
<A NAME="307"></A>his brothers whom he had brought up when they were younger, and had raised 
<A NAME="308"></A>from humble station to high office and from poverty to immense wealth. 
<A NAME="309"></A>Not one of these was he able to work upon by persuasion, instruction, services 
<A NAME="310"></A>and ties of kindred, so as to make him a partner in his rule; and he showed 
<A NAME="311"></A>himself inferior to Darius with a sevenfold inferiority. For Darius did 
<A NAME="312"></A>not put his trust in brothers or in men whom he had brought up, but only 
<A NAME="313"></A>in his confederates in the overthrow of the Mede and Eunuch; and to these 
<A NAME="314"></A>he assigned portions of his empire, seven in number, each of them greater 
<A NAME="315"></A>than all Sicily; and they were faithful to him and did not attack either 
<A NAME="316"></A>him or one another. Thus he showed a pattern of what the good lawgiver 
<A NAME="317"></A>and king ought to be; for he drew up laws by which he has secured the Persian 
<A NAME="318"></A>empire in safety down to the present time.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>Again, to give another instance, the Athenians took under their 
<A NAME="320"></A>rule very many cities not founded by themselves, which had been hard hit 
<A NAME="321"></A>by the barbarians but were still in existence, and maintained their rule 
<A NAME="322"></A>over these for seventy years, because they had in each them men whom they 
<A NAME="323"></A>could trust. But Dionysios, who had gathered the whole of Sicily into a 
<A NAME="324"></A>single city, and was so clever that he trusted no one, only secured his 
<A NAME="325"></A>own safety with great difficulty. For he was badly off for trustworthy 
<A NAME="326"></A>friends; and there is no surer criterion of virtue and vice than this, 
<A NAME="327"></A>whether a man is or is not destitute of such friends.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>This, then, was the advice which Dion and I gave to Dionysios, 
<A NAME="329"></A>since, owing to bringing up which he had received from his father, he had 
<A NAME="330"></A>had no advantages in the way of education or of suitable lessons, in the 
<A NAME="331"></A>first place...; and, in the second place, that, after starting in this 
<A NAME="332"></A>way, he should make friends of others among his connections who were of 
<A NAME="333"></A>the same age and were in sympathy with his pursuit of virtue, but above 
<A NAME="334"></A>all that he should be in harmony with himself; for this it was of which 
<A NAME="335"></A>he was remarkably in need. This we did not say in plain words, for that 
<A NAME="336"></A>would not have been safe; but in covert language we maintained that every 
<A NAME="337"></A>man in this way would save both himself and those whom he was leading, 
<A NAME="338"></A>and if he did not follow this path, he would do just the opposite of this. 
<A NAME="339"></A>And after proceeding on the course which we described, and making himself 
<A NAME="340"></A>a wise and temperate man, if he were then to found again the cities of 
<A NAME="341"></A>Sicily which had been laid waste, and bind them together by laws and constitutions, 
<A NAME="342"></A>so as to be loyal to him and to one another in their resistance to the 
<A NAME="343"></A>attacks of the barbarians, he would, we told him, make his father's empire 
<A NAME="344"></A>not merely double what it was but many times greater. For, if these things 
<A NAME="345"></A>were done, his way would be clear to a more complete subjugation of the 
<A NAME="346"></A>Carthaginians than that which befell them in Gelon's time, whereas in our 
<A NAME="347"></A>own day his father had followed the opposite course of levying attribute 
<A NAME="348"></A>for the barbarians. This was the language and these the exhortations given 
<A NAME="349"></A>by us, the conspirators against Dionysios according to the charges circulated 
<A NAME="350"></A>from various sources-charges which, prevailing as they did with Dionysios, 
<A NAME="351"></A>caused the expulsion of Dion and reduced me to a state of apprehension. 
<A NAME="352"></A>But when-to summarise great events which happened in no great time-Dion 
<A NAME="353"></A>returned from the Peloponnese and Athens, his advice to Dionysios took 
<A NAME="354"></A>the form of action.
<A NAME="355"></A><BR><BR>To proceed-when Dion had twice over delivered the city and restored 
<A NAME="356"></A>it to the citizens, the Syracusans went through the same changes of feeling 
<A NAME="357"></A>towards him as Dionysios had gone through, when Dion attempted first to 
<A NAME="358"></A>educate him and train him to be a sovereign worthy of supreme power and, 
<A NAME="359"></A>when that was done, to be his coadjutor in all the details of his career. 
<A NAME="360"></A>Dionysios listened to those who circulated slanders to the effect that 
<A NAME="361"></A>Dion was aiming at the tyranny in all the steps which he took at that time 
<A NAME="362"></A>his intention being that Dionysios, when his mind had fallen under the 
<A NAME="363"></A>spell of culture, should neglect the government and leave it in his hands, 
<A NAME="364"></A>and that he should then appropriate it for himself and treacherously depose 
<A NAME="365"></A>Dionysios. These slanders were victorious on that occasion; they were so 
<A NAME="366"></A>once more when circulated among the Syracusans, winning a victory which 
<A NAME="367"></A>took an extraordinary course and proved disgraceful to its authors. The 
<A NAME="368"></A>story of what then took place is one which deserves careful attention on 
<A NAME="369"></A>the part of those who are inviting me to deal with the present 
<A NAME="370"></A>situation.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>I, an Athenian and friend of Dion, came as his ally to the court 
<A NAME="372"></A>of Dionysios, in order that I might create good will in place of a state 
<A NAME="373"></A>war; in my conflict with the authors of these slanders I was worsted. When 
<A NAME="374"></A>Dionysios tried to persuade me by offers of honours and wealth to attach 
<A NAME="375"></A>myself to him, and with a view to giving a decent colour to Dion's expulsion 
<A NAME="376"></A>a witness and friend on his side, he failed completely in his attempt. 
<A NAME="377"></A>Later on, when Dion returned from exile, he took with him from Athens two 
<A NAME="378"></A>brothers, who had been his friends, not from community in philosophic study, 
<A NAME="379"></A>but with the ordinary companionship common among most friends, which they 
<A NAME="380"></A>form as the result of relations of hospitality and the intercourse which 
<A NAME="381"></A>occurs when one man initiates the other in the mysteries. It was from this 
<A NAME="382"></A>kind of intercourse and from services connected with his return that these 
<A NAME="383"></A>two helpers in his restoration became his companions. Having come to Sicily, 
<A NAME="384"></A>when they perceived that Dion had been misrepresented to the Sicilian Greeks, 
<A NAME="385"></A>whom he had liberated, as one that plotted to become monarch, they not 
<A NAME="386"></A>only betrayed their companion and friend, but shared personally in the 
<A NAME="387"></A>guilt of his murder, standing by his murderers as supporters with weapons 
<A NAME="388"></A>in their hands. The guilt and impiety of their conduct I neither excuse 
<A NAME="389"></A>nor do I dwell upon it. For many others make it their business to harp 
<A NAME="390"></A>upon it, and will make it their business in the future. But I do take exception 
<A NAME="391"></A>to the statement that, because they were Athenians, they have brought shame 
<A NAME="392"></A>upon this city. For I say that he too is an Athenian who refused to betray 
<A NAME="393"></A>this same Dion, when he had the offer of riches and many other honours. 
<A NAME="394"></A>For his was no common or vulgar friendship, but rested on community in 
<A NAME="395"></A>liberal education, and this is the one thing in which a wise man will put 
<A NAME="396"></A>his trust, far more than in ties of personal and bodily kinship. So the 
<A NAME="397"></A>two murderers of Dion were not of sufficient importance to be causes of 
<A NAME="398"></A>disgrace to this city, as though they had been men of any 
<A NAME="399"></A>note.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>All this has been said with a view to counselling the friends and 
<A NAME="401"></A>family of Dion. And in addition to this I give for the third time to you 
<A NAME="402"></A>the same advice and counsel which I have given twice before to others-not 
<A NAME="403"></A>to enslave Sicily or any other State to despots-this my counsel but-to 
<A NAME="404"></A>put it under the rule of laws-for the other course is better neither for 
<A NAME="405"></A>the enslavers nor for the enslaved, for themselves, their children's children 
<A NAME="406"></A>and descendants; the attempt is in every way fraught with disaster. It 
<A NAME="407"></A>is only small and mean natures that are bent upon seizing such gains for 
<A NAME="408"></A>themselves, natures that know nothing of goodness and justice, divine as 
<A NAME="409"></A>well as human, in this life and in the next.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>These are the lessons which I tried to teach, first to Dion, secondly 
<A NAME="411"></A>to Dionysios, and now for the third time to you. Do you obey me thinking 
<A NAME="412"></A>of Zeus the Preserver, the patron of third ventures, and looking at the 
<A NAME="413"></A>lot of Dionysios and Dion, of whom the one who disobeyed me is living in 
<A NAME="414"></A>dishonour, while he who obeyed me has died honourably. For the one thing 
<A NAME="415"></A>which is wholly right and noble is to strive for that which is most honourable 
<A NAME="416"></A>for a man's self and for his country, and to face the consequences whatever 
<A NAME="417"></A>they may be. For none of us can escape death, nor, if a man could do so, 
<A NAME="418"></A>would it, as the vulgar suppose, make him happy. For nothing evil or good, 
<A NAME="419"></A>which is worth mentioning at all, belongs to things soulless; but good 
<A NAME="420"></A>or evil will be the portion of every soul, either while attached to the 
<A NAME="421"></A>body or when separated from it.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>And we should in very truth always believe those ancient and sacred 
<A NAME="423"></A>teachings, which declare that the soul is immortal, that it has judges, 
<A NAME="424"></A>and suffers the greatest penalties when it has been separated from the 
<A NAME="425"></A>body. Therefore also we should consider it a lesser evil to suffer great 
<A NAME="426"></A>wrongs and outrages than to do them. The covetous man, impoverished as 
<A NAME="427"></A>he is in the soul, turns a deaf ear to this teaching; or if he hears it, 
<A NAME="428"></A>he laughs it to scorn with fancied superiority, and shamelessly snatches 
<A NAME="429"></A>for himself from every source whatever his bestial fancy supposes will 
<A NAME="430"></A>provide for him the means of eating or drinking or glutting himself with 
<A NAME="431"></A>that slavish and gross pleasure which is falsely called after the goddess 
<A NAME="432"></A>of love. He is blind and cannot see in those acts of plunder which are 
<A NAME="433"></A>accompanied by impiety what heinous guilt is attached to each wrongful 
<A NAME="434"></A>deed, and that the offender must drag with him the burden of this impiety 
<A NAME="435"></A>while he moves about on earth, and when he has travelled beneath the earth 
<A NAME="436"></A>on a journey which has every circumstance of shame and 
<A NAME="437"></A>misery.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>It was by urging these and other like truths that I convinced Dion, 
<A NAME="439"></A>and it is I who have the best right to be angered with his murderers in 
<A NAME="440"></A>much the same way as I have with Dionysios. For both they and he have done 
<A NAME="441"></A>the greatest injury to me, and I might almost say to all mankind, they 
<A NAME="442"></A>by slaying the man that was willing to act righteously, and he by refusing 
<A NAME="443"></A>to act righteously during the whole of his rule, when he held supreme power, 
<A NAME="444"></A>in which rule if philosophy and power had really met together, it would 
<A NAME="445"></A>have sent forth a light to all men, Greeks and barbarians, establishing 
<A NAME="446"></A>fully for all the true belief that there can be no happiness either for 
<A NAME="447"></A>the community or for the individual man, unless he passes his life under 
<A NAME="448"></A>the rule of righteousness with the guidance of wisdom, either possessing 
<A NAME="449"></A>these virtues in himself, or living under the rule of godly men and having 
<A NAME="450"></A>received a right training and education in morals. These were the aims 
<A NAME="451"></A>which Dionysios injured, and for me everything else is a trifling injury 
<A NAME="452"></A>compared with this.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR>The murderer of Dion has, without knowing it, done the same as 
<A NAME="454"></A>Dionysios. For as regards Dion, I know right well, so far as it is possible 
<A NAME="455"></A>for a man to say anything positively about other men, that, if he had got 
<A NAME="456"></A>the supreme power, he would never have turned his mind to any other form 
<A NAME="457"></A>of rule, but that, dealing first with Syracuse, his own native land, when 
<A NAME="458"></A>he had made an end of her slavery, clothed her in bright apparel, and given 
<A NAME="459"></A>her the garb of freedom, he would then by every means in his power have 
<A NAME="460"></A>ordered aright the lives of his fellow-citizens by suitable and excellent 
<A NAME="461"></A>laws; and the thing next in order, which he would have set his heart to 
<A NAME="462"></A>accomplish, was to found again all the States of Sicily and make them free 
<A NAME="463"></A>from the barbarians, driving out some and subduing others, an easier task 
<A NAME="464"></A>for him than it was for Hiero. If these things had been accomplished by 
<A NAME="465"></A>a man who was just and brave and temperate and a philosopher, the same 
<A NAME="466"></A>belief with regard to virtue would have been established among the majority 
<A NAME="467"></A>which, if Dionysios had been won over, would have been established, I might 
<A NAME="468"></A>almost say, among all mankind and would have given them salvation. But 
<A NAME="469"></A>now some higher power or avenging fiend has fallen upon them, inspiring 
<A NAME="470"></A>them with lawlessness, godlessness and acts of recklessness issuing from 
<A NAME="471"></A>ignorance, the seed from which all evils for all mankind take root and 
<A NAME="472"></A>grow and will in future bear the bitterest harvest for those who brought 
<A NAME="473"></A>them into being. This ignorance it was which in that second venture wrecked 
<A NAME="474"></A>and ruined everything.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR>And now, for good luck's sake, let us on this third venture abstain 
<A NAME="476"></A>from words of ill omen. But, nevertheless, I advise you, his friends, to 
<A NAME="477"></A>imitate in Dion his love for his country and his temperate habits of daily 
<A NAME="478"></A>life, and to try with better auspices to carry out his wishes-what these 
<A NAME="479"></A>were, you have heard from me in plain words. And whoever among you cannot 
<A NAME="480"></A>live the simple Dorian life according to the customs of your forefathers, 
<A NAME="481"></A>but follows the manner of life of Dion's murderers and of the Sicilians, 
<A NAME="482"></A>do not invite this man to join you, or expect him to do any loyal or salutary 
<A NAME="483"></A>act; but invite all others to the work of resettling all the States of 
<A NAME="484"></A>Sicily and establishing equality under the laws, summoning them from Sicily 
<A NAME="485"></A>itself and from the whole Peloponnese-and have no fear even of Athens; 
<A NAME="486"></A>for there, also, are men who excel all mankind in their devotion to virtue 
<A NAME="487"></A>and in hatred of the reckless acts of those who shed the blood of 
<A NAME="488"></A>friends.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR>But if, after all, this is work for a future time, whereas immediate 
<A NAME="490"></A>action is called for by the disorders of all sorts and kinds which arise 
<A NAME="491"></A>every day from your state of civil strife, every man to whom Providence 
<A NAME="492"></A>has given even a moderate share of right intelligence ought to know that 
<A NAME="493"></A>in times of civil strife there is no respite from trouble till the victors 
<A NAME="494"></A>make an end of feeding their grudge by combats and banishments and executions, 
<A NAME="495"></A>and of wreaking their vengeance on their enemies. They should master themselves 
<A NAME="496"></A>and, enacting impartial laws, framed not to gratify themselves more than 
<A NAME="497"></A>the conquered party, should compel men to obey these by two restraining 
<A NAME="498"></A>forces, respect and fear; fear, because they are the masters and can display 
<A NAME="499"></A>superior force; respect, because they rise superior to pleasures and are 
<A NAME="500"></A>willing and able to be servants to the laws. There is no other way save 
<A NAME="501"></A>this for terminating the troubles of a city that is in a state of civil 
<A NAME="502"></A>strife; but a constant continuance of internal disorders, struggles, hatred 
<A NAME="503"></A>and mutual distrust is the common lot of cities which are in that 
<A NAME="504"></A>plight.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>Therefore, those who have for the time being gained the upper hand, 
<A NAME="506"></A>when they desire to secure their position, must by their own act and choice 
<A NAME="507"></A>select from all Hellas men whom they have ascertained to be the best for 
<A NAME="508"></A>the purpose. These must in the first place be men of mature years, who 
<A NAME="509"></A>have children and wives at home, and, as far as possible, a long line of 
<A NAME="510"></A>ancestors of good repute, and all must be possessed of sufficient property. 
<A NAME="511"></A>For a city of ten thousand householders their numbers should be fifty; 
<A NAME="512"></A>that is enough. These they must induce to come from their own homes by 
<A NAME="513"></A>entreaties and the promise of the highest honours; and having induced them 
<A NAME="514"></A>to come they must entreat and command them to draw up laws after binding 
<A NAME="515"></A>themselves by oath to show no partiality either to conquerors or to conquered, 
<A NAME="516"></A>but to give equal and common rights to the whole State.
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>When laws have been enacted, what everything then hinges on is 
<A NAME="518"></A>this. If the conquerors show more obedience to the laws than the conquered, 
<A NAME="519"></A>the whole State will be full of security and happiness, and there will 
<A NAME="520"></A>be an escape from all your troubles. But if they do not, then do not summon 
<A NAME="521"></A>me or any other helper to aid you against those who do not obey the counsel 
<A NAME="522"></A>I now give you. For this course is akin to that which Dion and I attempted 
<A NAME="523"></A>to carry out with our hearts set on the welfare of Syracuse. It is indeed 
<A NAME="524"></A>a second best course. The first and best was that scheme of welfare to 
<A NAME="525"></A>all mankind which we attempted to carry out with the co-operation of Dionysios; 
<A NAME="526"></A>but some chance, mightier than men, brought it to nothing. Do you now, 
<A NAME="527"></A>with good fortune attending you and with Heaven's help, try to bring your 
<A NAME="528"></A>efforts to a happier issue.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>Let this be the end of my advice and injunction and of the narrative 
<A NAME="530"></A>of my first visit to Dionysios. Whoever wishes may next hear of my second 
<A NAME="531"></A>journey and voyage, and learn that it was a reasonable and suitable proceeding. 
<A NAME="532"></A>My first period of residence in Sicily was occupied in the way which I 
<A NAME="533"></A>related before giving my advice to the relatives and friends of Dion. After 
<A NAME="534"></A>those events I persuaded Dionysios by such arguments as I could to let 
<A NAME="535"></A>me go; and we made an agreement as to what should be done when peace was 
<A NAME="536"></A>made; for at that time there was a state of war in Sicily. Dionysios said 
<A NAME="537"></A>that, when he had put the affairs of his empire in a position of greater 
<A NAME="538"></A>safety for himself, he would send for Dion and me again; and he desired 
<A NAME="539"></A>that Dion should regard what had befallen him not as an exile, but as a 
<A NAME="540"></A>change of residence. I agreed to come again on these 
<A NAME="541"></A>conditions.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>When peace had been made, he began sending for me; he requested 
<A NAME="543"></A>that Dion should wait for another year, but begged that I should by all 
<A NAME="544"></A>means come. Dion now kept urging and entreating me to go. For persistent 
<A NAME="545"></A>rumours came from Sicily that Dionysios was now once more possessed by 
<A NAME="546"></A>an extraordinary desire for philosophy. For this reason Dion pressed me 
<A NAME="547"></A>urgently not to decline his invitation. But though I was well aware that 
<A NAME="548"></A>as regards philosophy such symptoms were not uncommon in young men, still 
<A NAME="549"></A>it seemed to me safer at that time to part company altogether with Dion 
<A NAME="550"></A>and Dionysios; and I offended both of them by replying that I was an old 
<A NAME="551"></A>man, and that the steps now being taken were quite at variance with the 
<A NAME="552"></A>previous agreement.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>After this, it seems, Archytes came to the court of Dionysios. 
<A NAME="554"></A>Before my departure I had brought him and his Tarentine circle into friendly 
<A NAME="555"></A>relations with Dionysios. There were some others in Syracuse who had received 
<A NAME="556"></A>some instruction from Dion, and others had learnt from these, getting their 
<A NAME="557"></A>heads full of erroneous teaching on philosophical questions. These, it 
<A NAME="558"></A>seems, were attempting to hold discussions with Dionysios on questions 
<A NAME="559"></A>connected with such subjects, in the idea that he had been fully instructed 
<A NAME="560"></A>in my views. Now is not at all devoid of natural gifts for learning, and 
<A NAME="561"></A>he has a great craving for honour and glory. What was said probably pleased 
<A NAME="562"></A>him, and he felt some shame when it became clear that he had not taken 
<A NAME="563"></A>advantage of my teaching during my visit. For these reasons he conceived 
<A NAME="564"></A>a desire for more definite instruction, and his love of glory was an additional 
<A NAME="565"></A>incentive to him. The real reasons why he had learnt nothing during my 
<A NAME="566"></A>previous visit have just been set forth in the preceding narrative. Accordingly, 
<A NAME="567"></A>now that I was safe at home and had refused his second invitation, as I 
<A NAME="568"></A>just now related, Dionysios seems to have felt all manner of anxiety lest 
<A NAME="569"></A>certain people should suppose that I was unwilling to visit him again because 
<A NAME="570"></A>I had formed a poor opinion of his natural gifts and character, and because, 
<A NAME="571"></A>knowing as I did his manner of life, I disapproved of 
<A NAME="572"></A>it.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>It is right for me to speak the truth, and make no complaint if 
<A NAME="574"></A>anyone, after hearing the facts, forms a poor opinion of my philosophy, 
<A NAME="575"></A>and thinks that the tyrant was in the right. Dionysios now invited me for 
<A NAME="576"></A>the third time, sending a trireme to ensure me comfort on the voyage; he 
<A NAME="577"></A>sent also Archedemos-one of those who had spent some time with Archytes, 
<A NAME="578"></A>and of whom he supposed that I had a higher opinion than of any of the 
<A NAME="579"></A>Sicilian Greeks-and, with him, other men of repute in Sicily. These all 
<A NAME="580"></A>brought the same report, that Dionysios had made progress in philosophy. 
<A NAME="581"></A>He also sent a very long letter, knowing as he did my relations with Dion 
<A NAME="582"></A>and Dion's eagerness also that I should take ship and go to Syracuse. The 
<A NAME="583"></A>letter was framed in its opening sentences to meet all these conditions, 
<A NAME="584"></A>and the tenor of it was as follows: "Dionysios to Plato," here followed 
<A NAME="585"></A>the customary greeting and immediately after it he said, "If in compliance 
<A NAME="586"></A>with our request you come now, in the first place, Dion's affairs will 
<A NAME="587"></A>be dealt with in whatever way you yourself desire; I know that you will 
<A NAME="588"></A>desire what is reasonable, and I shall consent to it. But if not, none 
<A NAME="589"></A>of Dion's affairs will have results in accordance with your wishes, with 
<A NAME="590"></A>regard either to Dion himself or to other matters." This he said in these 
<A NAME="591"></A>words; the rest it would be tedious and inopportune to quote. Other letters 
<A NAME="592"></A>arrived from Archytes and the Tarentines, praising the philosophical studies 
<A NAME="593"></A>of Dionysios and saying that, if I did not now come, I should cause a complete 
<A NAME="594"></A>rupture in their friendship with Dionysios, which had been brought about 
<A NAME="595"></A>by me and was of no small importance to their political 
<A NAME="596"></A>interests.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>When this invitation came to me at that time in such terms, and 
<A NAME="598"></A>those who had come from Sicily and Italy were trying to drag me thither, 
<A NAME="599"></A>while my friends at Athens were literally pushing me out with their urgent 
<A NAME="600"></A>entreaties, it was the same old tale-that I must not betray Dion and my 
<A NAME="601"></A>Tarentine friends and supporters. Also I myself had a lurking feeling that 
<A NAME="602"></A>there was nothing surprising in the fact that a young man, quick to learn, 
<A NAME="603"></A>hearing talk of the great truths of philosophy, should feel a craving for 
<A NAME="604"></A>the higher life. I thought therefore that I must put the matter definitely 
<A NAME="605"></A>to the test to see whether his desire was genuine or the reverse, and on 
<A NAME="606"></A>no account leave such an impulse unaided nor make myself responsible for 
<A NAME="607"></A>such a deep and real disgrace, if the reports brought by anyone were really 
<A NAME="608"></A>true. So blindfolding myself with this reflection, I set out, with many 
<A NAME="609"></A>fears and with no very favourable anticipations, as was natural enough. 
<A NAME="610"></A>However, I went, and my action on this occasion at any rate was really 
<A NAME="611"></A>a case of "the third to the Preserver," for I had the good fortune to return 
<A NAME="612"></A>safely; and for this I must, next to the God, thank Dionysios, because, 
<A NAME="613"></A>though many wished to make an end of me, he prevented them and paid some 
<A NAME="614"></A>proper respect to my situation.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>On my arrival, I thought that first I must put to the test the 
<A NAME="616"></A>question whether Dionysios had really been kindled with the fire of philosophy, 
<A NAME="617"></A>or whether all the reports which had come to Athens were empty rumours. 
<A NAME="618"></A>Now there is a way of putting such things to the test which is not to be 
<A NAME="619"></A>despised and is well suited to monarchs, especially to those who have got 
<A NAME="620"></A>their heads full of erroneous teaching, which immediately my arrival I 
<A NAME="621"></A>found to be very much the case with Dionysios. One should show such men 
<A NAME="622"></A>what philosophy is in all its extent; what their range of studies is by 
<A NAME="623"></A>which it is approached, and how much labour it involves. For the man who 
<A NAME="624"></A>has heard this, if he has the true philosophic spirit and that godlike 
<A NAME="625"></A>temperament which makes him a kin to philosophy and worthy of it, thinks 
<A NAME="626"></A>that he has been told of a marvellous road lying before him, that he must 
<A NAME="627"></A>forthwith press on with all his strength, and that life is not worth living 
<A NAME="628"></A>if he does anything else. After this he uses to the full his own powers 
<A NAME="629"></A>and those of his guide in the path, and relaxes not his efforts, till he 
<A NAME="630"></A>has either reached the end of the whole course of study or gained such 
<A NAME="631"></A>power that he is not incapable of directing his steps without the aid of 
<A NAME="632"></A>a guide. This is the spirit and these are the thoughts by which such a 
<A NAME="633"></A>man guides his life, carrying out his work, whatever his occupation may 
<A NAME="634"></A>be, but throughout it all ever cleaving to philosophy and to such rules 
<A NAME="635"></A>of diet in his daily life as will give him inward sobriety and therewith 
<A NAME="636"></A>quickness in learning, a good memory, and reasoning power; the kind of 
<A NAME="637"></A>life which is opposed to this he consistently hates. Those who have not 
<A NAME="638"></A>the true philosophic temper, but a mere surface colouring of opinions penetrating, 
<A NAME="639"></A>like sunburn, only skin deep, when they see how great the range of studies 
<A NAME="640"></A>is, how much labour is involved in it, and how necessary to the pursuit 
<A NAME="641"></A>it is to have an orderly regulation of the daily life, come to the conclusion 
<A NAME="642"></A>that the thing is difficult and impossible for them, and are actually incapable 
<A NAME="643"></A>of carrying out the course of study; while some of them persuade themselves 
<A NAME="644"></A>that they have sufficiently studied the whole matter and have no need of 
<A NAME="645"></A>any further effort. This is the sure test and is the safest one to apply 
<A NAME="646"></A>to those who live in luxury and are incapable of continuous effort; it 
<A NAME="647"></A>ensures that such a man shall not throw the blame upon his teacher but 
<A NAME="648"></A>on himself, because he cannot bring to the pursuit all the qualities necessary 
<A NAME="649"></A>to it. Thus it came about that I said to Dionysios what I did say on that 
<A NAME="650"></A>occasion.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR>I did not, however, give a complete exposition, nor did Dionysios 
<A NAME="652"></A>ask for one. For he professed to know many, and those the most important, 
<A NAME="653"></A>points, and to have a sufficient hold of them through instruction given 
<A NAME="654"></A>by others. I hear also that he has since written about what he heard from 
<A NAME="655"></A>me, composing what professes to be his own handbook, very different, so 
<A NAME="656"></A>he says, from the doctrines which he heard from me; but of its contents 
<A NAME="657"></A>I know nothing; I know indeed that others have written on the same subjects; 
<A NAME="658"></A>but who they are, is more than they know themselves. Thus much at least, 
<A NAME="659"></A>I can say about all writers, past or future, who say they know the things 
<A NAME="660"></A>to which I devote myself, whether by hearing the teaching of me or of others, 
<A NAME="661"></A>or by their own discoveries-that according to my view it is not possible 
<A NAME="662"></A>for them to have any real skill in the matter. There neither is nor ever 
<A NAME="663"></A>will be a treatise of mine on the subject. For it does not admit of exposition 
<A NAME="664"></A>like other branches of knowledge; but after much converse about the matter 
<A NAME="665"></A>itself and a life lived together, suddenly a light, as it were, is kindled 
<A NAME="666"></A>in one soul by a flame that leaps to it from another, and thereafter sustains 
<A NAME="667"></A>itself. Yet this much I know-that if the things were written or put into 
<A NAME="668"></A>words, it would be done best by me, and that, if they were written badly, 
<A NAME="669"></A>I should be the person most pained. Again, if they had appeared to me to 
<A NAME="670"></A>admit adequately of writing and exposition, what task in life could I have 
<A NAME="671"></A>performed nobler than this, to write what is of great service to mankind 
<A NAME="672"></A>and to bring the nature of things into the light for all to see? But I 
<A NAME="673"></A>do not think it a good thing for men that there should be a disquisition, 
<A NAME="674"></A>as it is called, on this topic-except for some few, who are able with a 
<A NAME="675"></A>little teaching to find it out for themselves. As for the rest, it would 
<A NAME="676"></A>fill some of them quite illogically with a mistaken feeling of contempt, 
<A NAME="677"></A>and others with lofty and vain-glorious expectations, as though they had 
<A NAME="678"></A>learnt something high and mighty.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>On this point I intend to speak a little more at length; for perhaps, 
<A NAME="680"></A>when I have done so, things will be clearer with regard to my present subject. 
<A NAME="681"></A>There is an argument which holds good against the man ventures to put anything 
<A NAME="682"></A>whatever into writing on questions of this nature; it has often before 
<A NAME="683"></A>been stated by me, and it seems suitable to the present 
<A NAME="684"></A>occasion.
<A NAME="685"></A><BR><BR>For everything that exists there are three instruments by which 
<A NAME="686"></A>the knowledge of it is necessarily imparted; fourth, there is the knowledge 
<A NAME="687"></A>itself, and, as fifth, we must count the thing itself which is known and 
<A NAME="688"></A>truly exists. The first is the name, the, second the definition, the third. 
<A NAME="689"></A>the image, and the fourth the knowledge. If you wish to learn what I mean, 
<A NAME="690"></A>take these in the case of one instance, and so understand them in the case 
<A NAME="691"></A>of all. A circle is a thing spoken of, and its name is that very word which 
<A NAME="692"></A>we have just uttered. The second thing belonging to it is its definition, 
<A NAME="693"></A>made up names and verbal forms. For that which has the name "round," "annular," 
<A NAME="694"></A>or, "circle," might be defined as that which has the distance from its 
<A NAME="695"></A>circumference to its centre everywhere equal. Third, comes that which is 
<A NAME="696"></A>drawn and rubbed out again, or turned on a lathe and broken up-none of 
<A NAME="697"></A>which things can happen to the circle itself-to which the other things, 
<A NAME="698"></A>mentioned have reference; for it is something of a different order from 
<A NAME="699"></A>them. Fourth, comes knowledge, intelligence and right opinion about these 
<A NAME="700"></A>things. Under this one head we must group everything which has its existence, 
<A NAME="701"></A>not in words nor in bodily shapes, but in souls-from which it is dear that 
<A NAME="702"></A>it is something different from the nature of the circle itself and from 
<A NAME="703"></A>the three things mentioned before. Of these things intelligence comes closest 
<A NAME="704"></A>in kinship and likeness to the fifth, and the others are farther 
<A NAME="705"></A>distant.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR>The same applies to straight as well as to circular form, to colours, 
<A NAME="707"></A>to the good, the, beautiful, the just, to all bodies whether manufactured 
<A NAME="708"></A>or coming into being in the course of nature, to fire, water, and all such 
<A NAME="709"></A>things, to every living being, to character in souls, and to all things 
<A NAME="710"></A>done and suffered. For in the case of all these, no one, if he has not 
<A NAME="711"></A>some how or other got hold of the four things first mentioned, can ever 
<A NAME="712"></A>be completely a partaker of knowledge of the fifth. Further, on account 
<A NAME="713"></A>of the weakness of language, these (i.e., the four) attempt to show what 
<A NAME="714"></A>each thing is like, not less than what each thing is. For this reason no 
<A NAME="715"></A>man of intelligence will venture to express his philosophical views in 
<A NAME="716"></A>language, especially not in language that is unchangeable, which is true 
<A NAME="717"></A>of that which is set down in written characters.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR><BR>Again you must learn the point which comes next. Every circle, 
<A NAME="719"></A>of those which are by the act of man drawn or even turned on a lathe, is 
<A NAME="720"></A>full of that which is opposite to the fifth thing. For everywhere it has 
<A NAME="721"></A>contact with the straight. But the circle itself, we say, has nothing in 
<A NAME="722"></A>either smaller or greater, of that which is its opposite. We say also that 
<A NAME="723"></A>the name is not a thing of permanence for any of them, and that nothing 
<A NAME="724"></A>prevents the things now called round from being called straight, and the 
<A NAME="725"></A>straight things round; for those who make changes and call things by opposite 
<A NAME="726"></A>names, nothing will be less permanent (than a name). Again with regard 
<A NAME="727"></A>to the definition, if it is made up of names and verbal forms, the same 
<A NAME="728"></A>remark holds that there is no sufficiently durable permanence in it. And 
<A NAME="729"></A>there is no end to the instances of the ambiguity from which each of the 
<A NAME="730"></A>four suffers; but the greatest of them is that which we mentioned a little 
<A NAME="731"></A>earlier, that, whereas there are two things, that which has real being, 
<A NAME="732"></A>and that which is only a quality, when the soul is seeking to know, not 
<A NAME="733"></A>the quality, but the essence, each of the four, presenting to the soul 
<A NAME="734"></A>by word and in act that which it is not seeking (i.e., the quality), a 
<A NAME="735"></A>thing open to refutation by the senses, being merely the thing presented 
<A NAME="736"></A>to the soul in each particular case whether by statement or the act of 
<A NAME="737"></A>showing, fills, one may say, every man with puzzlement and 
<A NAME="738"></A>perplexity.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>Now in subjects in which, by reason of our defective education, 
<A NAME="740"></A>we have not been accustomed even to search for the truth, but are satisfied 
<A NAME="741"></A>with whatever images are presented to us, we are not held up to ridicule 
<A NAME="742"></A>by one another, the questioned by questioners, who can pull to pieces and 
<A NAME="743"></A>criticise the four things. But in subjects where we try to compel a man 
<A NAME="744"></A>to give a clear answer about the fifth, any one of those who are capable 
<A NAME="745"></A>of overthrowing an antagonist gets the better of us, and makes the man, 
<A NAME="746"></A>who gives an exposition in speech or writing or in replies to questions, 
<A NAME="747"></A>appear to most of his hearers to know nothing of the things on which he 
<A NAME="748"></A>is attempting to write or speak; for they are sometimes not aware that 
<A NAME="749"></A>it is not the mind of the writer or speaker which is proved to be at fault, 
<A NAME="750"></A>but the defective nature of each of the four instruments. The process however 
<A NAME="751"></A>of dealing with all of these, as the mind moves up and down to each in 
<A NAME="752"></A>turn, does after much effort give birth in a well-constituted mind to knowledge 
<A NAME="753"></A>of that which is well constituted. But if a man is ill-constituted by nature 
<A NAME="754"></A>(as the state of the soul is naturally in the majority both in its capacity 
<A NAME="755"></A>for learning and in what is called moral character)-or it may have become 
<A NAME="756"></A>so by deterioration-not even Lynceus could endow such men with the power 
<A NAME="757"></A>of sight.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR>In one word, the man who has no natural kinship with this matter 
<A NAME="759"></A>cannot be made akin to it by quickness of learning or memory; for it cannot 
<A NAME="760"></A>be engendered at all in natures which are foreign to it. Therefore, if 
<A NAME="761"></A>men are not by nature kinship allied to justice and all other things that 
<A NAME="762"></A>are honourable, though they may be good at learning and remembering other 
<A NAME="763"></A>knowledge of various kinds-or if they have the kinship but are slow learners 
<A NAME="764"></A>and have no memory-none of all these will ever learn to the full the truth 
<A NAME="765"></A>about virtue and vice. For both must be learnt together; and together also 
<A NAME="766"></A>must be learnt, by complete and long continued study, as I said at the 
<A NAME="767"></A>beginning, the true and the false about all that has real being. After 
<A NAME="768"></A>much effort, as names, definitions, sights, and other data of sense, are 
<A NAME="769"></A>brought into contact and friction one with another, in the course of scrutiny 
<A NAME="770"></A>and kindly testing by men who proceed by question and answer without ill 
<A NAME="771"></A>will, with a sudden flash there shines forth understanding about every 
<A NAME="772"></A>problem, and an intelligence whose efforts reach the furthest limits of 
<A NAME="773"></A>human powers. Therefore every man of worth, when dealing with matters of 
<A NAME="774"></A>worth, will be far from exposing them to ill feeling and misunderstanding 
<A NAME="775"></A>among men by committing them to writing. In one word, then, it may be known 
<A NAME="776"></A>from this that, if one sees written treatises composed by anyone, either 
<A NAME="777"></A>the laws of a lawgiver, or in any other form whatever, these are not for 
<A NAME="778"></A>that man the things of most worth, if he is a man of worth, but that his 
<A NAME="779"></A>treasures are laid up in the fairest spot that he possesses. But if these 
<A NAME="780"></A>things were worked at by him as things of real worth, and committed to 
<A NAME="781"></A>writing, then surely, not gods, but men "have themselves bereft him of 
<A NAME="782"></A>his wits."
<A NAME="783"></A><BR><BR>Anyone who has followed this discourse and digression will know 
<A NAME="784"></A>well that, if Dionysios or anyone else, great or small, has written a treatise 
<A NAME="785"></A>on the highest matters and the first principles of things, he has, so I 
<A NAME="786"></A>say, neither heard nor learnt any sound teaching about the subject of his 
<A NAME="787"></A>treatise; otherwise, he would have had the same reverence for it, which 
<A NAME="788"></A>I have, and would have shrunk from putting it forth into a world of discord 
<A NAME="789"></A>and uncomeliness. For he wrote it, not as an aid to memory-since there 
<A NAME="790"></A>is no risk of forgetting it, if a man's soul has once laid hold of it; 
<A NAME="791"></A>for it is expressed in the shortest of statements-but if he wrote it at 
<A NAME="792"></A>all, it was from a mean craving for honour, either putting it forth as 
<A NAME="793"></A>his own invention, or to figure as a man possessed of culture, of which 
<A NAME="794"></A>he was not worthy, if his heart was set on the credit of possessing it. 
<A NAME="795"></A>If then Dionysios gained this culture from the one lesson which he had 
<A NAME="796"></A>from me, we may perhaps grant him the possession of it, though how he acquired 
<A NAME="797"></A>it-God wot, as the Theban says; for I gave him the teaching, which I have 
<A NAME="798"></A>described, on that one occasion and never again.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR><BR>The next point which requires to be made clear to anyone who wishes 
<A NAME="800"></A>to discover how things really happened, is the reason why it came about 
<A NAME="801"></A>that I did not continue my teaching in a second and third lesson and yet 
<A NAME="802"></A>oftener. Does Dionysios, after a single lesson, believe himself to know 
<A NAME="803"></A>the matter, and has he an adequate knowledge of it, either as having discovered 
<A NAME="804"></A>it for himself or learnt it before from others, or does he believe my teaching 
<A NAME="805"></A>to be worthless, or, thirdly, to be beyond his range and too great for 
<A NAME="806"></A>him, and himself to be really unable to live as one who gives his mind 
<A NAME="807"></A>to wisdom and virtue? For if he thinks it worthless, he will have to contend 
<A NAME="808"></A>with many who say the opposite, and who would be held in far higher repute 
<A NAME="809"></A>as judges than Dionysios, if on the other hand, he thinks he has discovered 
<A NAME="810"></A>or learnt the things and that they are worth having as part of a liberal 
<A NAME="811"></A>education, how could he, unless he is an extraordinary person, have so 
<A NAME="812"></A>recklessly dishonoured the master who has led the way in these subjects? 
<A NAME="813"></A>How he dishonoured him, I will now state.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR><BR>Up to this time he had allowed Dion to remain in possession of 
<A NAME="815"></A>his property and to receive the income from it. But not long after the 
<A NAME="816"></A>foregoing events, as if he had entirely forgotten his letter to that effect, 
<A NAME="817"></A>he no longer allowed Dion's trustees to send him remittances to the Peloponnese, 
<A NAME="818"></A>on the pretence that the owner of the property was not Dion but Dion's 
<A NAME="819"></A>son, his own nephew, of whom he himself was legally the trustee. These 
<A NAME="820"></A>were the actual facts which occurred up to the point which we have reached. 
<A NAME="821"></A>They had opened my eyes as to the value of Dionysios' desire for philosophy, 
<A NAME="822"></A>and I had every right to complain, whether I wished to do so or not. Now 
<A NAME="823"></A>by this time it was summer and the season for sea voyages; therefore I 
<A NAME="824"></A>decided that I must not be vexed with Dionysios rather than with myself 
<A NAME="825"></A>and those who had forced me to come for the third time into the strait 
<A NAME="826"></A>of Scylla, that once again I might to fell Charybdis measure back my course, 
<A NAME="827"></A>but must tell Dionysios that it was impossible for me to remain after this 
<A NAME="828"></A>outrage had been put upon Dion. He tried to soothe me and begged me to 
<A NAME="829"></A>remain, not thinking it desirable for himself that I should arrive post 
<A NAME="830"></A>haste in person as the bearer of such tidings. When his entreaties produced 
<A NAME="831"></A>no effect, he promised that he himself would provide me with transport. 
<A NAME="832"></A>For my intention was to embark on one of the trading ships and sail away, 
<A NAME="833"></A>being indignant and thinking it my duty to face all dangers, in case I 
<A NAME="834"></A>was prevented from going-since plainly and obviously I was doing no wrong, 
<A NAME="835"></A>but was the party wronged.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR><BR>Seeing me not at all inclined to stay, he devised the following 
<A NAME="837"></A>scheme to make me stay during that sading season. On the next day he came 
<A NAME="838"></A>to me and made a plausible proposal: "Let us put an end," he said, "to 
<A NAME="839"></A>these constant quarrels between you and me about Dion and his affairs. 
<A NAME="840"></A>For your sake I will do this for Dion. I require him to take his own property 
<A NAME="841"></A>and reside in the Peloponnese, not as an exile, but on the understanding 
<A NAME="842"></A>that it is open for him to migrate here, when this step has the joint approval 
<A NAME="843"></A>of himself, me, and you his friends; and this shall be open to him on the 
<A NAME="844"></A>understanding that he does not plot against me. You and your friends and 
<A NAME="845"></A>Dion's friends here must be sureties for him in this, and he must give 
<A NAME="846"></A>you security. Let the funds which he receives be deposited in the Peloponnese 
<A NAME="847"></A>and at Athens, with persons approved by you, and let Dion enjoy the income 
<A NAME="848"></A>from them but have no power to take them out of deposit without the approval 
<A NAME="849"></A>of you and your friends. For I have no great confidence in him, that, if 
<A NAME="850"></A>he has this property at his disposal, he will act justly towards me, for 
<A NAME="851"></A>it will be no small amount; but I have more confidence in you and your 
<A NAME="852"></A>friends. See if this satisfies you; and on these conditions remain for 
<A NAME="853"></A>the present year, and at the next season you shall depart taking the property 
<A NAME="854"></A>with you. I am quite sure that Dion will be grateful to you, if you accomplish 
<A NAME="855"></A>so much on his behalf."
<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR>When I heard this proposal I was vexed, but after reflection said 
<A NAME="857"></A>I would let him know my view of it on the following day. We agreed to that 
<A NAME="858"></A>effect for the moment, and afterwards when I was by myself I pondered the 
<A NAME="859"></A>matter in much distress. The first reflection that came up, leading the 
<A NAME="860"></A>way in my self-communing, was this: "Come suppose that Dionysios intends 
<A NAME="861"></A>to do none of the things which he has mentioned, but that, after my departure, 
<A NAME="862"></A>he writes a plausible letter to Dion, and orders several of his creatures 
<A NAME="863"></A>to write to the same effect, telling him of the proposal which he has now 
<A NAME="864"></A>made to me, making out that he was willing to do what he proposed, but 
<A NAME="865"></A>that I refused and completely neglected Dion's interests. Further, suppose 
<A NAME="866"></A>that he is not willing to allow my departure, and without giving personal 
<A NAME="867"></A>orders to any of the merchants, makes it clear, as he easily can, to all 
<A NAME="868"></A>that he not wish me to sail, will anyone consent to take me as a passenger, 
<A NAME="869"></A>when I leave the house: of Dionysios?"
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR>For in addition to my other troubles, I was lodging at that time 
<A NAME="871"></A>in the garden which surround his house, from which even the gatekeeper 
<A NAME="872"></A>would have refused to let me go, unless an order had been sent to him from 
<A NAME="873"></A>Dionysios. "Suppose however that I wait for the year, I shall be able to 
<A NAME="874"></A>write word of these things to Dion, stating the position in which I am, 
<A NAME="875"></A>and the steps which I am trying to take. And if Dionysios does any of the 
<A NAME="876"></A>things which he says, I shall have accomplished something that is not altogether 
<A NAME="877"></A>to be sneered at; for Dion's property is, at a fair estimate, perhaps not 
<A NAME="878"></A>less than a hundred talents. If however the prospect which I see looming 
<A NAME="879"></A>in the future takes the course which may reasonably be expected, I know 
<A NAME="880"></A>not what I shall do with myself. Still it is perhaps necessary to go on 
<A NAME="881"></A>working for a year, and to attempt to prove by actual fact the machinations 
<A NAME="882"></A>of Dionysios."
<A NAME="883"></A><BR><BR>Having come to this decision, on the following day I said to Dionysios, 
<A NAME="884"></A>"I have decided to remain. But," I continued, "I must ask that you will 
<A NAME="885"></A>not regard me as empowered to act for Dion, but will along with me write 
<A NAME="886"></A>a letter to him, stating what has now been decided, and enquire whether 
<A NAME="887"></A>this course satisfies him. If it does not, and if he has other wishes and 
<A NAME="888"></A>demands, he must write particulars of them as soon as possible, and you 
<A NAME="889"></A>must not as yet take any hasty step with regard to his 
<A NAME="890"></A>interests."
<A NAME="891"></A><BR><BR>This was what was said and this was the agreement which was made, 
<A NAME="892"></A>almost in these words. Well, after this the trading-ships took their departure, 
<A NAME="893"></A>and it was no longer possible for me to take mine, when Dionysios, if you 
<A NAME="894"></A>please, addressed me with the remark that half the property must be regarded 
<A NAME="895"></A>as belonging to Dion and half to his son. Therefore, he said, he would 
<A NAME="896"></A>sell it, and when it was sold would give half to me to take away, and would 
<A NAME="897"></A>leave half on the spot for the son. This course, he said, was the most 
<A NAME="898"></A>just. This proposal was a blow to me, and I thought it absurd to argue 
<A NAME="899"></A>any longer with him; however, I said that we must wait for Dion's letter, 
<A NAME="900"></A>and then once more write to tell him of this new proposal. His next step 
<A NAME="901"></A>was the brilliant one of selling the whole of Dion's property, using his 
<A NAME="902"></A>own discretion with regard to the manner and terms of the sale and of the 
<A NAME="903"></A>purchasers. He spoke not a word to me about the matter from beginning to 
<A NAME="904"></A>end, and I followed his example and never talked to him again about Dion's 
<A NAME="905"></A>affairs; for I did not think that I could do any good by doing so. This 
<A NAME="906"></A>is the history so far of my efforts to come to the rescue of philosophy 
<A NAME="907"></A>and of my friends.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR><BR>After this Dionysios and I went on with our daily life, I with 
<A NAME="909"></A>my eyes turned abroad like a bird yearning to fly from its perch, and he 
<A NAME="910"></A>always devising some new way of scaring me back and of keeping a tight 
<A NAME="911"></A>hold on Dion's property. However, we gave out to all Sicily that we were 
<A NAME="912"></A>friends. Dionysios, now deserting the policy of his father, attempted to 
<A NAME="913"></A>lower the pay of the older members of his body guard. The soldiers were 
<A NAME="914"></A>furious, and, assembling in great numbers, declared that they would not 
<A NAME="915"></A>submit. He attempted to use force to them, shutting the gates of the acropolis; 
<A NAME="916"></A>but they charged straight for the walls, yelling out an unintelligible 
<A NAME="917"></A>and ferocious war cry. Dionysios took fright and conceded all their demands 
<A NAME="918"></A>and more to the peltasts then assembled.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR><BR>A rumour soon spread that Heracleides had been the cause of all 
<A NAME="920"></A>the trouble. Hearing this, Heracleides kept out of the way. Dionysios was 
<A NAME="921"></A>trying to get hold of him, and being unable to do so, sent for Theodotes 
<A NAME="922"></A>to come to him in his garden. It happened that I was walking in the garden 
<A NAME="923"></A>at the same time. I neither know nor did I hear the rest of what passed 
<A NAME="924"></A>between them, but what Theodotes said to Dionysios in my presence I know 
<A NAME="925"></A>and remember. "Plato," he said, "I am trying to convince our friend Dionysios 
<A NAME="926"></A>that, if I am able to bring Heracleides before us to defend himself on 
<A NAME="927"></A>the charges which have been made against him, and if he decides that Heracleides 
<A NAME="928"></A>must no longer live in Sicily, he should be allowed (this is my point) 
<A NAME="929"></A>to take his son and wife and sail to the Peloponnese and reside there, 
<A NAME="930"></A>taking no action there against Dionysios and enjoying the income of his 
<A NAME="931"></A>property. I have already sent for him and will send for him again; and 
<A NAME="932"></A>if he comes in obedience either to my former message or to this one-well 
<A NAME="933"></A>and good. But I beg and entreat Dionysios that, if anyone finds Heracleides 
<A NAME="934"></A>either in the country or here, no harm shall come to him, but that he may 
<A NAME="935"></A>retire from the country till Dionysios comes to some other decision. Do 
<A NAME="936"></A>you agree to this?" he added, addressing Dionysios. "I agree," he replied, 
<A NAME="937"></A>"that even if he is found at your house, no harm shall be done to him beyond 
<A NAME="938"></A>what has now been said."
<A NAME="939"></A><BR><BR>On the following day Eurybios and Theodotes came to me in the evening, 
<A NAME="940"></A>both greatly disturbed. Theodotes said, "Plato, you were present yesterday 
<A NAME="941"></A>during the promises made by Dionysios to me and to you about Heracleides?" 
<A NAME="942"></A>"Certainly," I replied. "Well," he continued, "at this moment peltasts 
<A NAME="943"></A>are scouring the country seeking to arrest Heracleides; and he must be 
<A NAME="944"></A>somewhere in this neighbourhood. For Heaven's sake come with us to Dionysios." 
<A NAME="945"></A>So we went and stood in the presence of Dionysios; and those two stood 
<A NAME="946"></A>shedding silent tears, while I said: "These men are afraid that you may 
<A NAME="947"></A>take strong measures with regard to Heracleides contrary to what was agreed 
<A NAME="948"></A>yesterday. For it seems that he has returned and has been seen somewhere 
<A NAME="949"></A>about here." On hearing this he blazed up and turned all colours, as a 
<A NAME="950"></A>man would in a rage. Theodotes, falling before him in tears, took his hand 
<A NAME="951"></A>and entreated him to do nothing of the sort. But I broke in and tried to 
<A NAME="952"></A>encourage him, saying: "Be of good cheer, Theodotes; Dionysios will not 
<A NAME="953"></A>have the heart to take any fresh step contrary to his promises of yesterday." 
<A NAME="954"></A>Fixing his eye on me, and assuming his most autocratic air he said, "To 
<A NAME="955"></A>you I promised nothing small or great." "By the gods," I said, "you did 
<A NAME="956"></A>promise that forbearance for which our friend here now appeals." With these 
<A NAME="957"></A>words I turned away and went out. After this he continued the hunt for 
<A NAME="958"></A>Heracleides, and Theodotes, sending messages, urged Heracleides to take 
<A NAME="959"></A>flight. Dionysios sent out Teisias and some peltasts with orders to pursue 
<A NAME="960"></A>him. But Heracleides, as it was said, was just in time, by a small fraction 
<A NAME="961"></A>of a day, in making his escape into Carthaginian territory.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR><BR>After this Dionysios thought that his long cherished scheme not 
<A NAME="963"></A>to restore Dion's property would give him a plausible excuse for hostility 
<A NAME="964"></A>towards me; and first of all he sent me out of the acropolis, finding a 
<A NAME="965"></A>pretext that the women were obliged to hold a sacrificial service for ten 
<A NAME="966"></A>days in the garden in which I had my lodging. He therefore ordered me to 
<A NAME="967"></A>stay outside in the house of Archedemos during this period. While I was 
<A NAME="968"></A>there, Theodotes sent for me and made a great outpouring of indignation 
<A NAME="969"></A>at these occurrences, throwing the blame on Dionysios. Hearing that I had 
<A NAME="970"></A>been to see Theodotes he regarded this, as another excuse, sister to the 
<A NAME="971"></A>previous one, for quarrelling with me. Sending a messenger he enquired 
<A NAME="972"></A>if I had really been conferring with Theodotes on his invitation "Certainly," 
<A NAME="973"></A>I replied, "Well," continued the messenger, "he ordered me to tell you 
<A NAME="974"></A>that you are not acting at all well in preferring always Dion and Dion's 
<A NAME="975"></A>friends to him." And he did not send for me to return to his house, as 
<A NAME="976"></A>though it were now clear that Theodotes and Heracleides were my friends, 
<A NAME="977"></A>and he my enemy. He also thought that I had no kind feelings towards him 
<A NAME="978"></A>because the property of Dion was now entirely done for.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR><BR>After this I resided outside the acropolis among the mercenaries. 
<A NAME="980"></A>Various people then came to me, among them those of the ships' crews who 
<A NAME="981"></A>came from Athens, my own fellow citizens, and reported that I was evil 
<A NAME="982"></A>spoken of among the peltasts, and that some of them were threatening to 
<A NAME="983"></A>make an end of me, if they could ket hold of me Accordingly I devised the 
<A NAME="984"></A>following plan for my safety.
<A NAME="985"></A><BR><BR>I sent to Archytes and my other friends in Taras, telling them 
<A NAME="986"></A>the plight I was in. Finding some excuse for an embassy from their city, 
<A NAME="987"></A>they sent a thirty-oared galley with Lamiscos, one of themselves, who came 
<A NAME="988"></A>and entreated Dionysios about me, saying that I wanted to go, and that 
<A NAME="989"></A>he should on no account stand in my way. He consented and allowed me to 
<A NAME="990"></A>go, giving me money for the journey. But for Dion's property I made no 
<A NAME="991"></A>further request, nor was any of it restored.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR>I made my way to the Peloponnese to Olympia, where I found Dion 
<A NAME="993"></A>a spectator at the Games, and told him what had occurred. Calling Zeus 
<A NAME="994"></A>to be his witness, he at once urged me with my relatives and friends to 
<A NAME="995"></A>make preparations for taking vengeance on Dionysios-our ground for action 
<A NAME="996"></A>being the breach of faith to a guest-so he put it and regarded it, while 
<A NAME="997"></A>his own was his unjust expulsion and banishment. Hearing this, I told him 
<A NAME="998"></A>that he might call my friends to his aid, if they wished to go; "But for 
<A NAME="999"></A>myself," I continued, "you and others in a way forced me to be the sharer 
<A NAME="1000"></A>of Dionysios' table and hearth and his associate in the acts of religion. 
<A NAME="1001"></A>He probably believed the current slanders, that I was plotting with you 
<A NAME="1002"></A>against him and his despotic rule; yet feelings of scruple prevailed with 
<A NAME="1003"></A>him, and he spared my life. Again, I am hardly of the age for being comrade 
<A NAME="1004"></A>in arms to anyone; also I stand as a neutral between you, if ever you desire 
<A NAME="1005"></A>friendship and wish to benefit one another; so long as you aim at injuring 
<A NAME="1006"></A>one another, call others to your aid." This I said, because I was disgusted 
<A NAME="1007"></A>with my misguided journeyings to Sicily and my ill-fortune there. But they 
<A NAME="1008"></A>disobeyed me and would not listen to my attempts at reconciliation, and 
<A NAME="1009"></A>so brought on their own heads all the evils which have since taken place. 
<A NAME="1010"></A>For if Dionysios had restored to Dion his property or been reconciled with 
<A NAME="1011"></A>him on any terms, none of these things would have happened, so far as human 
<A NAME="1012"></A>foresight can foretell. Dion would have easily been kept in check by my 
<A NAME="1013"></A>wishes and influence. But now, rushing upon one another, they have caused 
<A NAME="1014"></A>universal disaster.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR><BR>Dion's aspiration however was the same that I should say my own 
<A NAME="1016"></A>or that of any other right-minded man ought to be. With regard to his own 
<A NAME="1017"></A>power, his friends and his country the ideal of such a man would be to 
<A NAME="1018"></A>win the greatest power and honour by rendering the greatest services. And 
<A NAME="1019"></A>this end is not attained if a man gets riches for himself, his supporters 
<A NAME="1020"></A>and his country, by forming plots and getting together conspirators, being 
<A NAME="1021"></A>all the while a poor creature, not master of himself, overcome by the cowardice 
<A NAME="1022"></A>which fears to fight against pleasures; nor is it attained if he goes on 
<A NAME="1023"></A>to kill the men of substance, whom he speaks of as the enemy, and to plunder 
<A NAME="1024"></A>their possessions, and invites his confederates and supporters to do the 
<A NAME="1025"></A>same, with the object that no one shall say that it is his fault, if he 
<A NAME="1026"></A>complains of being poor. The same is true if anyone renders services of 
<A NAME="1027"></A>this kind to the State and receives honours from her for distributing by 
<A NAME="1028"></A>decrees the property of the few among the many-or if, being in charge the 
<A NAME="1029"></A>affairs of a great State which rules over many small ones, he unjustly 
<A NAME="1030"></A>appropriates to his own State the possessions of the small ones. For neither 
<A NAME="1031"></A>a Dion nor any other man will, with his eyes open, make his way by steps 
<A NAME="1032"></A>like these to a power which will be fraught with destruction to himself 
<A NAME="1033"></A>and his descendants for all time; but he will advance towards constitutional 
<A NAME="1034"></A>government and the framing of the justest and best laws, reaching these 
<A NAME="1035"></A>ends without executions and murders even on the smallest 
<A NAME="1036"></A>scale.
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR><BR>This course Dion actually followed, thinking it preferable to suffer 
<A NAME="1038"></A>iniquitous deeds rather than to do them; but, while taking precautions 
<A NAME="1039"></A>against them, he nevertheless, when he had reached the climax of victory 
<A NAME="1040"></A>over his enemies, took a false step and fell, a catastrophe not at all 
<A NAME="1041"></A>surprising. For a man of piety, temperance and wisdom, when dealing with 
<A NAME="1042"></A>the impious, would not be entirely blind to the character of such men, 
<A NAME="1043"></A>but it would perhaps not be surprising if he suffered the catastrophe that 
<A NAME="1044"></A>might befall a good ship's captain, who would not be entirely unaware of 
<A NAME="1045"></A>the approach of a storm, but might be unaware of its extraordinary and 
<A NAME="1046"></A>startling violence, and might therefore be overwhelmed by its force. The 
<A NAME="1047"></A>same thing caused Dion's downfall. For he was not unaware that his assailants 
<A NAME="1048"></A>were thoroughly bad men, but he was unaware how high a pitch of infatuation 
<A NAME="1049"></A>and of general wickedness and greed they had reached. This was the cause 
<A NAME="1050"></A>of his downfall, which has involved Sicily in countless 
<A NAME="1051"></A>sorrows.
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR><BR>As to the steps which should be taken after the events which I 
<A NAME="1053"></A>have now related, my advice has been given pretty fully and may be regarded 
<A NAME="1054"></A>as finished; and if you ask my reasons for recounting the story of my second 
<A NAME="1055"></A>journey to Sicily, it seemed to me essential that an account of it must 
<A NAME="1056"></A>be given because of the strange and paradoxical character of the incidents. 
<A NAME="1057"></A>If in this present account of them they appear to anyone more intelligible, 
<A NAME="1058"></A>and seem to anyone to show sufficient grounds in view of the circumstances, 
<A NAME="1059"></A>the present statement is adequate and not too lengthy.
