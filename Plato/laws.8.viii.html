<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Athenian Stranger. Next, with the help of the Delphian oracle, we have 
<A NAME="11"></A>to institute festivals and make laws about them, and to determine what 
<A NAME="12"></A>sacrifices will be for the good of the city, and to what Gods they shall 
<A NAME="13"></A>be offered; but when they shall be offered, and how often, may be partly 
<A NAME="14"></A>regulated by us.
<A NAME="15"></A><BR><BR><B>Cleinias.</B> The number-yes.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then we will first determine the number; and let the whole 
<A NAME="17"></A>number be 365-one for every day-so that one magistrate at least will sacrifice 
<A NAME="18"></A>daily to some God or demi-god on behalf of the city, and the citizens, 
<A NAME="19"></A>and their possessions. And the interpreters, and priests, and priestesses, 
<A NAME="20"></A>and prophets shall meet, and, in company with the guardians of the law, 
<A NAME="21"></A>ordain those things which the legislator of necessity omits; and I may 
<A NAME="22"></A>remark that they are the very persons who ought to take note of what is 
<A NAME="23"></A>omitted. The law will say that there are twelve feasts dedicated to the 
<A NAME="24"></A>twelve Gods, after whom the several tribes are named; and that to each 
<A NAME="25"></A>of them they shall sacrifice every month, and appoint choruses, and musical 
<A NAME="26"></A>and gymnastic contests, assigning them so as to suit the Gods and seasons 
<A NAME="27"></A>of the year. And they shall have festivals for women, distinguishing those 
<A NAME="28"></A>which ought to be separated from the men's festivals, and those which ought 
<A NAME="29"></A>not. Further, they shall not confuse the infernal deities and their rites 
<A NAME="30"></A>with the Gods who are termed heavenly and their rites, but shall separate 
<A NAME="31"></A>them, giving to Pluto his own in the twelfth month, which is sacred to 
<A NAME="32"></A>him, according to the law. To such a deity warlike men should entertain 
<A NAME="33"></A>no aversion, but they should honour him as being always the best friend 
<A NAME="34"></A>of man. For the connection of soul and body is no way better than the dissolution 
<A NAME="35"></A>of them, as I am ready to maintain quite seriously. Moreover, those who 
<A NAME="36"></A>would regulate these matters rightly should consider, that our city among 
<A NAME="37"></A>existing cities has fellow, either in respect of leisure or comin and of 
<A NAME="38"></A>the necessaries of life, and that like an individual she ought to live 
<A NAME="39"></A>happily. And those who would live happily should in the first place do 
<A NAME="40"></A>no wrong to one another, and ought not themselves to be wronged by others; 
<A NAME="41"></A>to attain the first is not difficult, but there is great difficulty, in 
<A NAME="42"></A>acquiring the power of not being wronged. No man can be perfectly secure 
<A NAME="43"></A>against wrong, unless he has become perfectly good; and cities are like 
<A NAME="44"></A>individuals in this, for a city if good has a life of peace, but if evil, 
<A NAME="45"></A>a life of war within and without. Wherefore the citizens ought to practise 
<A NAME="46"></A>war-not in time of war, but rather while they are at peace. And every city 
<A NAME="47"></A>which has any sense, should take the field at least for one day in every 
<A NAME="48"></A>month; and for more if the magistrates think fit, having no regard to winter 
<A NAME="49"></A>cold or summer heat; and they should go out en masse, including their wives 
<A NAME="50"></A>and their children, when the magistrates determine to lead forth the whole 
<A NAME="51"></A>people, or in separate portions when summoned by them; and they should 
<A NAME="52"></A>always provide that there should be games and sacrificial feasts, and they 
<A NAME="53"></A>should have tournaments, imitating in as lively a manner as they can real 
<A NAME="54"></A>battles. And they should distribute prizes of victory and valour to the 
<A NAME="55"></A>competitors, passing censures and encomiums on one another according to 
<A NAME="56"></A>the characters which they bear in the contests and their whole life, honouring 
<A NAME="57"></A>him who seems to be the best, and blaming him who is the opposite. And 
<A NAME="58"></A>let poets celebrate the victors-not however every poet, but only one who 
<A NAME="59"></A>in the first place is not less than fifty years of age; nor should he be 
<A NAME="60"></A>one who, although he may have musical and poetical gifts, has never in 
<A NAME="61"></A>his life done any noble or illustrious action; but those who are themselves 
<A NAME="62"></A>good and also honourable in the state, creators of noble actions-let their 
<A NAME="63"></A>poems be sung, even though they be not very musical. And let the judgment 
<A NAME="64"></A>of them rest with the instructor of youth and the other guardians of the 
<A NAME="65"></A>laws, who shall give them this privilege, and they alone shall be free 
<A NAME="66"></A>to sing; but the rest of the world shall not have this liberty. Nor shall 
<A NAME="67"></A>any one dare to sing a song which has not been approved by the judgment 
<A NAME="68"></A>of the guardians of the laws, not even if his strain be sweeter than the 
<A NAME="69"></A>songs of Thamyras and Orpheus; but only and Orpheus; but only such poems 
<A NAME="70"></A>as have been judged sacred and dedicated to the Gods, and such as are the 
<A NAME="71"></A>works of good men, which praise of blame has been awarded and which have 
<A NAME="72"></A>been deemed to fulfil their design fairly.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>The regulations about and about liberty of speech in poitry, ought 
<A NAME="74"></A>to apply equally to men and women. The legislator may be supposed to argue 
<A NAME="75"></A>the question in his own mind:-Who are my citizens for whom I have set in 
<A NAME="76"></A>order the city? Are they not competitors in the greatest of all contests, 
<A NAME="77"></A>and have they not innumerable rivals? To be sure, will be the natural, 
<A NAME="78"></A>reply. Well, but if we were training boxers, or pancratiasts, or any other 
<A NAME="79"></A>sort of athletes, would they never meet until the hour of contest arrived; 
<A NAME="80"></A>and should we do nothing to prepare ourselves previously by daily practice? 
<A NAME="81"></A>Surely, if we were boxers we should have been learning to fight for many 
<A NAME="82"></A>days before, and exercising ourselves in imitating all those blows and 
<A NAME="83"></A>wards which we were intending to use in the hour of conflict; and in order 
<A NAME="84"></A>that we might come as near to reality as possible, instead of cestuses 
<A NAME="85"></A>we should put on boxing gloves, that the blows and the wards might be practised 
<A NAME="86"></A>by us to the utmost of our power. And if there were a lack of competitors, 
<A NAME="87"></A>the ridicule of fools would ryot deter us from hanging up a lifeless image 
<A NAME="88"></A>and practising at that. Or if we had no adversary at all, animate or inanimate, 
<A NAME="89"></A>should we not venture in the dearth of antagonists to spar by ourselves? 
<A NAME="90"></A>In what other manner could we ever study the art of 
<A NAME="91"></A>self-defence?
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> The way which you mention Stranger, would be the only 
<A NAME="93"></A>way.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And shall the warriors of our city, who are destined when 
<A NAME="95"></A>occasion calli to enter the greatest of all contests, and to fight for 
<A NAME="96"></A>their lives, and their children, and their property, and the whole city, 
<A NAME="97"></A>be worse prepared than boxers? And will the legislator, because he is afraid 
<A NAME="98"></A>that their practising with one another may appear to some ridiculous, abstain 
<A NAME="99"></A>from commanding them to go out and fight; will he not ordain that soldiers 
<A NAME="100"></A>shall perform lesser exercises without arms every day, making dancing and 
<A NAME="101"></A>all gymnastic tend to this end; and also will he not require that they 
<A NAME="102"></A>shall practise some gymnastic exercises, greater as well as lesser, as 
<A NAME="103"></A>often as every month; and that they shall have contests one with another 
<A NAME="104"></A>in every part of the country, seizing upon posts and lying in ambush, and 
<A NAME="105"></A>imitating in every respect the reality of war; fighting with boxing-gloves 
<A NAME="106"></A>and hurling javelins, and using weapons somewhat dangerous, and as nearly 
<A NAME="107"></A>as possible like the true ones, in order that the sport may not be altogether 
<A NAME="108"></A>without fear, but may have terrors and to a certain degree show the man 
<A NAME="109"></A>who has and who has not courage; and that the honour and dishonour which 
<A NAME="110"></A>are assigned to them respectively, may prepare the whole city for the true 
<A NAME="111"></A>conflict of life? If any one dies in these mimic contests, the homicide 
<A NAME="112"></A>is involuntary, and we will make the slayer, when he has been purified 
<A NAME="113"></A>according to law, to be pure of blood, considering that if a few men should 
<A NAME="114"></A>die, others as good as they will be born; but that if fear is dead then 
<A NAME="115"></A>the citizens will never find a test of superior and inferior natures, which 
<A NAME="116"></A>is a far greater evil to the state than the loss of a 
<A NAME="117"></A>few.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> We are quite agreed, Stranger, that we should legislate 
<A NAME="119"></A>about such things, and that the whole state should practise them 
<A NAME="120"></A>supposed
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> And what is the reason that dances and contests of 
<A NAME="122"></A>this sort hardly ever exist in states, at least not to any extent worth 
<A NAME="123"></A>speaking of? Is this due to the ignorance of mankind and their 
<A NAME="124"></A>legislators?
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Perhaps.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Certainly not, sweet Cleinias; there are two causes, which 
<A NAME="127"></A>are quite enough to account for the deficiency.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What are they?
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> One cause is the love of wealth, which wholly absorbs men, 
<A NAME="130"></A>and never for a moment allows them to think of anything but their own private 
<A NAME="131"></A>possessions; on this the soul of every citizen hangs suspended, and can 
<A NAME="132"></A>attend to nothing but his daily gain; mankind are ready to learn any branch 
<A NAME="133"></A>of knowledge, and to follow any pursuit which tends to this end, and they 
<A NAME="134"></A>laugh at every other:-that is one reason why a city will not be in earnest 
<A NAME="135"></A>about such contests or any other good and honourable pursuit. But from 
<A NAME="136"></A>an insatiable love of gold and silver, every man will stoop to any art 
<A NAME="137"></A>or contrivance, seemly or unseemly, in the hope of becoming rich; and will 
<A NAME="138"></A>make no objection to performing any action, holy, or unholy and utterly 
<A NAME="139"></A>base, if only like a beast he have the power of eating and drinking all 
<A NAME="140"></A>kinds of things, and procuring for himself in every sort of way the gratification 
<A NAME="141"></A>of his lusts.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let this, then, be deemed one of the causes which prevent 
<A NAME="144"></A>states from pursuing in an efficient manner the art of war, or any other 
<A NAME="145"></A>noble aim, but makes the orderly and temperate part of mankind into merchants, 
<A NAME="146"></A>and captains of ships, and servants, and converts the valiant sort into 
<A NAME="147"></A>thieves and burglars and robbers of temples, and violent, tyrannical persons; 
<A NAME="148"></A>many of whom are not without ability, but they are unfortunate.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Must not they be truly unfortunate whose souls are compelled 
<A NAME="151"></A>to pass through life always hungering?
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Then that is one cause, Stranger; but you spoke of 
<A NAME="153"></A>another.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Thank you for reminding me.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> The insatiable life long love of wealth, as you were saying 
<A NAME="156"></A>is one clause which absorbs mankind, and prevents them from rightly practising 
<A NAME="157"></A>the arts of war:-Granted; and now tell me, what is the 
<A NAME="158"></A>other?
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Do you imagine that I delay because I am in a 
<A NAME="160"></A>perplexity?
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> No; but we think that you are too severe upon the money-loving 
<A NAME="162"></A>temper, of which you seem in the present discussion to have a peculiar 
<A NAME="163"></A>dislike.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> That is a very fair rebuke, Cleinias; and I will now 
<A NAME="165"></A>proceed to the second cause.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Proceed.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I say that governments are a cause-democracy, oligarchy, 
<A NAME="168"></A>tyranny, concerning which I have often spoken in the previous discourse; 
<A NAME="169"></A>or rather governments they are not, for none of them exercises a voluntary 
<A NAME="170"></A>rule over voluntary subjects; but they may be truly called states of discord, 
<A NAME="171"></A>in which while the government is voluntary, the subjects always obey against 
<A NAME="172"></A>their will, and have to be coerced; and the ruler fears the subject, and 
<A NAME="173"></A>will not, if he can help, allow him to become either noble, or rich, or 
<A NAME="174"></A>strong, or valiant, or warlike at all. These two are the chief causes of 
<A NAME="175"></A>almost all evils, and of the evils of which I have been speaking they are 
<A NAME="176"></A>notably the causes. But our state has escaped both of them; for her citizens 
<A NAME="177"></A>have the greatest leisure, and they are not subject to one another, and 
<A NAME="178"></A>will, I think, be made by these laws the reverse of lovers of money. Such 
<A NAME="179"></A>a constitution may be reasonably supposed to be the only one existing which 
<A NAME="180"></A>will accept the education which we have described, and the martial pastimes 
<A NAME="181"></A>which have been perfected according to our idea.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> True.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then next we must remember, about all gymnastic contests, 
<A NAME="184"></A>that only the warlike sort of them are to be practised and to have prizes 
<A NAME="185"></A>of victory; and those which are not military are to be given up. The military 
<A NAME="186"></A>sort had better be completely described and established by law; and first, 
<A NAME="187"></A>let us speak of running and swiftness.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Certainly the most military of all qualities is general 
<A NAME="190"></A>activity of body, whether of foot or hand. For escaping or for capturing 
<A NAME="191"></A>an enemy, quickness of foot is required; but hand-to-hand conflict and 
<A NAME="192"></A>combat need vigour and strength.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Neither of them can attain their greatest efficiency without 
<A NAME="195"></A>arms.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How can they?
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Then our herald, in accordance with the prevailing practice, 
<A NAME="198"></A>will first summon the runner;-he will appear armed, for to an unarmed competitor 
<A NAME="199"></A>we will not give a prize. And he shall enter first who is to run the single 
<A NAME="200"></A>course bearing arms; next, he who is to run the double course; third, he 
<A NAME="201"></A>who is to run the horse-course; and fourthly, he who is to run the long 
<A NAME="202"></A>course; the fifth whom we start, shall be the first sent forth in heavy 
<A NAME="203"></A>armour, and shall run a course of sixty stadia to some temple of Ares-and 
<A NAME="204"></A>we will send forth another, whom we will style the more heavily armed, 
<A NAME="205"></A>to run over smoother ground. There remains the archer; and he shall run 
<A NAME="206"></A>in the full equipments of an archer a distance of 100 stadia over mountains, 
<A NAME="207"></A>and across every sort of country, to a temple of Apollo and Artemis; this 
<A NAME="208"></A>shall be the order of the contest, and we will wait for them until they 
<A NAME="209"></A>return, and will give a prize to the conqueror in each.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Let us suppose that there are three kinds of contests-one 
<A NAME="212"></A>of boys, another of beardless youths, and a third of men. For the youths 
<A NAME="213"></A>we will fix the length of the contest at two-thirds, and for the boys at 
<A NAME="214"></A>half of the entire course, whether they contend as archers or as heavy 
<A NAME="215"></A>armed. Touching the women, let the girls who are not grown up compete naked 
<A NAME="216"></A>in the stadium and the double course, and the horse-course and the long 
<A NAME="217"></A>course, and let them run on the race-ground itself; those who are thirteen 
<A NAME="218"></A>years of age and upwards until their marriage shall continue to share in 
<A NAME="219"></A>contests if they are not more than twenty, and shall be compelled to run 
<A NAME="220"></A>up to eighteen; and they shall descend into the arena in suitable dresses. 
<A NAME="221"></A>Let these be the regulations about contests in running both for men and 
<A NAME="222"></A>women.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>Respecting contests of strength, instead of wrestling and similar 
<A NAME="224"></A>contests of the heavier sort, we will institute conflicts in armour of 
<A NAME="225"></A>one against one, and two against two, and so on up to ten against ten. 
<A NAME="226"></A>As to what a man ought not to suffer or do, and to what extent, in order 
<A NAME="227"></A>to gain the victory-as in wrestling, the masters of the art have laid down 
<A NAME="228"></A>what is fair and what is not fair, so in fighting in armour-we ought to 
<A NAME="229"></A>call in skilful persons, who shall judge for us and be our assessors in 
<A NAME="230"></A>the work of legislation; they shall say who deserves to be victor in combats 
<A NAME="231"></A>of this sort, and what he is not to do or have done to him, and in like 
<A NAME="232"></A>manner what rule determines who is defeated; and let these ordinances apply 
<A NAME="233"></A>to women until they married as well as to men. The pancration shall have 
<A NAME="234"></A>a counterpart in a combat of the light armed; they shall contend with bows 
<A NAME="235"></A>and with light shields and with javelins and in the throwing of stones 
<A NAME="236"></A>by slings and by hand: and laws shall be made about it, and rewards and 
<A NAME="237"></A>prizes given to him who best fulfils the ordinances of the 
<A NAME="238"></A>law.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>Next in order we shall have to legislate about the horse contests. 
<A NAME="240"></A>Now we do not need many horses, for they cannot be of much use in a country 
<A NAME="241"></A>like Crete, and hence we naturally do not take great pains about the rearing 
<A NAME="242"></A>of them or about horse races. There is no one who keeps a chariot among 
<A NAME="243"></A>us, and any rivalry in such matters would be altogether out of place; there 
<A NAME="244"></A>would be no sense nor any shadow of sense in instituting contests which 
<A NAME="245"></A>are not after the manner of our country. And therefore we give our prizes 
<A NAME="246"></A>for single horses-for colts who have not yet cast their teeth, and for 
<A NAME="247"></A>those who are intermediate, and for the full-grown horses themselves; and 
<A NAME="248"></A>thus our equestrian games will accord with the nature of the country. Let 
<A NAME="249"></A>them have conflict and rivalry in these matters in accordance with the 
<A NAME="250"></A>law, and let the colonels and generals of horse decide together about all 
<A NAME="251"></A>courses and about the armed competitors in them. But we have nothing to 
<A NAME="252"></A>say to the unarmed either in gymnastic exercises or in these contests. 
<A NAME="253"></A>On the other hand, the Cretan bowman or javelin-man who fights in armour 
<A NAME="254"></A>on horseback is useful, and therefore we may as well place a competition 
<A NAME="255"></A>of this sort among amusements. Women are not to be forced to compete by 
<A NAME="256"></A>laws and ordinances; but if from previous training they have acquired the 
<A NAME="257"></A>habit and are strong enough and like to take part, let them do so, girls 
<A NAME="258"></A>as well as boys, and no blame to them.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>Thus the competition in gymnastic and the mode of learning it have 
<A NAME="260"></A>been described; and we have spoken also of the toils of the contest, and 
<A NAME="261"></A>of daily exercises under the superintendence of masters. Likewise, what 
<A NAME="262"></A>relates to music has been, for the most part, completed. But as to rhapsodes 
<A NAME="263"></A>and the like, and the contests of choruses which are to perform at feasts, 
<A NAME="264"></A>all this shall be arranged when the months and days and years have been 
<A NAME="265"></A>appointed for Gods and demi-gods, whether every third year, or again every 
<A NAME="266"></A>fifth year, or in whatever way or manner the Gods may put into men's minds 
<A NAME="267"></A>the distribution and order of them. At the same time, we may expect that 
<A NAME="268"></A>the musical contests will be celebrated in their turn by the command of 
<A NAME="269"></A>the judges and the director of education and the guardians of the law meeting 
<A NAME="270"></A>together for this purpose, and themselves becoming legislators of the times 
<A NAME="271"></A>and nature and conditions of the choral contests and of dancing in general. 
<A NAME="272"></A>What they ought severally to be in language and song, and in the admixture 
<A NAME="273"></A>of harmony with rhythm and the dance, has been often declared by the original 
<A NAME="274"></A>legislator; and his successors ought to follow him, making the games and 
<A NAME="275"></A>sacrifices duly to correspond at fitting times, and appointing public festivals. 
<A NAME="276"></A>It is not difficult to determine how these and the like matters may have 
<A NAME="277"></A>a regular order; nor, again, will the alteration of them do any great good 
<A NAME="278"></A>or harm to the state. There is, however, another matter of great importance 
<A NAME="279"></A>and difficulty, concerning which God should legislate, if there were any 
<A NAME="280"></A>possibility of obtaining from him an ordinance about it. But seeing that 
<A NAME="281"></A>divine aid is not to be had, there appears to be a need of some bold man 
<A NAME="282"></A>who specially honours plainness of speech, and will say outright what he 
<A NAME="283"></A>thinks best for the city and citizens-ordaining what is good and convenient 
<A NAME="284"></A>for the whole state amid the corruptions of human souls, opposing the mightiest 
<A NAME="285"></A>lusts, and having no man his helper but himself standing alone and following 
<A NAME="286"></A>reason only.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What is this, Stranger, that you are saying? For we 
<A NAME="288"></A>do not as yet understand your meaning.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Very likely; I will endeavour to explain myself more 
<A NAME="290"></A>clearly. When I came to the subject of education, I beheld young men and 
<A NAME="291"></A>maidens holding friendly intercourse with one another. And there naturally 
<A NAME="292"></A>arose in my mind a sort of apprehension-I could not help thinking how one 
<A NAME="293"></A>is to deal with a city in which youths and maidens are well nurtured, and 
<A NAME="294"></A>have nothing to do, and are not undergoing the excessive and servile toils 
<A NAME="295"></A>which extinguish wantonness, and whose only cares during their whole life 
<A NAME="296"></A>are sacrifices and festivals and dances. How, in such a state as this, 
<A NAME="297"></A>will they abstain from desires which thrust many a man and woman into perdition; 
<A NAME="298"></A>and from which reason, assuming the functions of law, commands them to 
<A NAME="299"></A>abstain? The ordinances already made may possibly get the better of most 
<A NAME="300"></A>of these desires; the prohibition of excessive wealth is a very considerable 
<A NAME="301"></A>gain in the direction of temperance, and the whole education of our youth 
<A NAME="302"></A>imposes a law of moderation on them; moreover, the eye of the rulers is 
<A NAME="303"></A>required always to watch over the young, and never to lose sight of them; 
<A NAME="304"></A>and these provisions do, as far as human means can effect anything, exercise 
<A NAME="305"></A>a regulating influence upon the desires in general. But how can we take 
<A NAME="306"></A>precautions against the unnatural loves of either sex, from which innumerable 
<A NAME="307"></A>evils have come upon individuals and cities? How shall we devise a remedy 
<A NAME="308"></A>and way of escape out of so great a danger? Truly, Cleinias, here is a 
<A NAME="309"></A>difficulty. In many ways Crete and Lacedaemon furnish a great help to those 
<A NAME="310"></A>who make peculiar laws; but in the matter of love, as we are alone, I must 
<A NAME="311"></A>confess that they are quite against us. For if any one following nature 
<A NAME="312"></A>should lay down the law which existed before the days of Laius, and denounce 
<A NAME="313"></A>these lusts as contrary to nature, adducing the animals as a proof that 
<A NAME="314"></A>such unions were monstrous, he might prove his point, but he would be wholly 
<A NAME="315"></A>at variance with the custom of your states. Further, they are repugnant 
<A NAME="316"></A>to a principle which we say that a legislator should always observe; for 
<A NAME="317"></A>we are always enquiring which of our enactments tends to virtue and which 
<A NAME="318"></A>not. And suppose we grant that these loves are accounted by law to be honourable, 
<A NAME="319"></A>or at least not disgraceful, in what degree will they contribute to virtue? 
<A NAME="320"></A>Will such passions implant in the soul of him who is seduced the habit 
<A NAME="321"></A>of courage, or in the soul of the seducer the principle of temperance? 
<A NAME="322"></A>Who will ever believe this?-or rather, who will not blame the effeminacy 
<A NAME="323"></A>of him who yields to pleasures and is unable to hold out against them? 
<A NAME="324"></A>Will not all men censure as womanly him who imitates the woman? And who 
<A NAME="325"></A>would ever think of establishing such a practice by law? Certainly no one 
<A NAME="326"></A>who had in his mind the image of true law. How can we prove, that what 
<A NAME="327"></A>I am saying is true? He who would rightly consider these matters must see 
<A NAME="328"></A>the nature of friendship and desire, and of these so-called loves, for 
<A NAME="329"></A>they are of two kinds, and out of the two arises a third kind, having the 
<A NAME="330"></A>same name; and this similarity of name causes all the difficulty and 
<A NAME="331"></A>obscurity.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> How is that?
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Dear is the like in virtue to the like, and the equal to 
<A NAME="334"></A>the equal; dear also, though unlike, is he who has abundance to him who 
<A NAME="335"></A>is in want. And when either of these friendships becomes excessive, we 
<A NAME="336"></A>term the excess love.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The friendship which arises from contraries is horrible 
<A NAME="339"></A>and coarse, and has often no tie of communion; but that which, arises from 
<A NAME="340"></A>likeness is gentle, and has a tie of communion which lasts through life. 
<A NAME="341"></A>As to the mixed sort which is made up of them both, there is, first of 
<A NAME="342"></A>all, a in determining what he who is possessed by this third love desires; 
<A NAME="343"></A>moreover, he is drawn different ways, and is in doubt between the two principles; 
<A NAME="344"></A>the one exhorting him to enjoy the beauty of youth, and the other forbidding 
<A NAME="345"></A>him. For the one is a lover of the body, and hungers after beauty, like 
<A NAME="346"></A>ripe fruit, and would fain satisfy himself without any regard to the character 
<A NAME="347"></A>of the beloved; the other holds the desire of the body to be a secondary 
<A NAME="348"></A>matter, and looking rather than loving and with his soul desiring the soul 
<A NAME="349"></A>of the other in a becoming manner, regards the satisfaction of the bodily 
<A NAME="350"></A>love as wantonness; he reverences and respects temperance and courage and 
<A NAME="351"></A>magnanimity and wisdom, and wishes to live chastely with the chaste object 
<A NAME="352"></A>of his affection. Now the sort of love which is made up of the other two 
<A NAME="353"></A>is that which we have described as the third. Seeing then that there are 
<A NAME="354"></A>these three sorts of love, ought the law to prohibit and forbid them all 
<A NAME="355"></A>to exist among us? Is it not rather clear that we should wish to have in 
<A NAME="356"></A>the state the love which is of virtue and which desires the beloved youth 
<A NAME="357"></A>to be the best possible; and the other two, if possible, we should hinder? 
<A NAME="358"></A>What do you say, friend Megillus?
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR><B>Megillus.</B> I think, Stranger, that you are perfectly right 
<A NAME="360"></A>in what you have been now saying.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> I knew well, my friend, that I should obtain your assent, 
<A NAME="362"></A>which I accept, and therefore have no need to analyse your custom any further. 
<A NAME="363"></A>Cleinias shall be prevailed upon to give me his assent at some other time. 
<A NAME="364"></A>Enough of this; and now let us proceed to the laws.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Upon reflection I see a way of imposing the law, which, 
<A NAME="367"></A>in one respect, is easy, but, in another, is of the utmost 
<A NAME="368"></A>difficulty.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> We are all aware that most men, in spite of their lawless 
<A NAME="371"></A>natures, are very strictly and precisely restrained from intercourse with 
<A NAME="372"></A>the fair, and this is not at all against their will, but entirely with 
<A NAME="373"></A>their will.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> When do you mean?
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> When any one has a brother or sister who is fair; and about 
<A NAME="376"></A>a son or daughter the same unwritten law holds, and is a most perfect safeguard, 
<A NAME="377"></A>so that no open or secret connection ever takes place between them. Nor 
<A NAME="378"></A>does the thought of such a thing ever enter at all into the minds of most 
<A NAME="379"></A>of them.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Does not a little word extinguish all pleasures of that 
<A NAME="382"></A>sort?
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><B>Meg.</B> What word?
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The declaration that they are unholy, hated of God, and 
<A NAME="385"></A>most infamous; and is not the reason of this that no one has ever said 
<A NAME="386"></A>the opposite, but every one from his earliest childhood has heard men speaking 
<A NAME="387"></A>in the same manner about them always and everywhere, whether in comedy 
<A NAME="388"></A>or in the graver language of tragedy? When the poet introduces on the stage 
<A NAME="389"></A>a Thyestes or an Oedipus, or a Macareus having secret intercourse with 
<A NAME="390"></A>his sister, he represents him, when found out, ready to kill himself as 
<A NAME="391"></A>the penalty of his sin.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> You are very right in saying that tradition, if no 
<A NAME="393"></A>breath of opposition ever assails it, has a marvellous 
<A NAME="394"></A>power.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> Am I not also right in saying that the legislator who 
<A NAME="396"></A>wants to master any of the passions which master man may easily know how 
<A NAME="397"></A>to subdue them? He will consecrate the tradition of their evil character 
<A NAME="398"></A>among all, slaves and freemen, women and children, throughout the city:-that 
<A NAME="399"></A>will be the surest foundation of the law which he can 
<A NAME="400"></A>make.
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Yes; but will he ever succeed in making all mankind 
<A NAME="402"></A>use the same language about them?
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> A good objection; but was I not just now saying that 
<A NAME="404"></A>I had a way to make men use natural love and abstain from unnatural, not 
<A NAME="405"></A>intentionally destroying the seeds of human increase, or sowing them in 
<A NAME="406"></A>stony places, in which they will take no root; and that I would command 
<A NAME="407"></A>them to abstain too from any female field of increase in which that which 
<A NAME="408"></A>is sown is not likely to grow? Now if a law to this effect could only be 
<A NAME="409"></A>made perpetual, and gain an authority such as already prevents intercourse 
<A NAME="410"></A>of parents and children-such a law, extending to other sensual desires, 
<A NAME="411"></A>and conquering them, would be the source of ten thousand blessings. For, 
<A NAME="412"></A>in the first place, moderation is the appointment of nature, and deters 
<A NAME="413"></A>men from all frenzy and madness of love, and from all adulteries and immoderate 
<A NAME="414"></A>use of meats and drinks, and makes them good friends to their own wives. 
<A NAME="415"></A>And innumerable other benefits would result if such a could only be enforced. 
<A NAME="416"></A>I can imagine some lusty youth who is standing by, and who, on hearing 
<A NAME="417"></A>this enactment, declares in scurrilous terms that we are making foolish 
<A NAME="418"></A>and impossible laws, and fills the world with his outcry. And therefore 
<A NAME="419"></A>I said that I knew a way of enacting and perpetuating such a law, which 
<A NAME="420"></A>was very easy in one respect, but in another most difficult. There is no 
<A NAME="421"></A>difficulty in seeing that such a law is possible, and in what way; for, 
<A NAME="422"></A>as I was saying, the ordinance once consecrated would master the soul of, 
<A NAME="423"></A>every man, and terrify him into obedience. But matters have now come to 
<A NAME="424"></A>such a pass that even then the desired result seems as if it could not 
<A NAME="425"></A>be attained, just as the continuance of an entire state in the practice 
<A NAME="426"></A>of common meals is also deemed impossible. And although this latter is 
<A NAME="427"></A>partly disproven by the fact of their existence among you, still even in 
<A NAME="428"></A>your cities the common meals of women would be regarded as unnatural and 
<A NAME="429"></A>impossible. I was thinking of the rebelliousness of the human heart when 
<A NAME="430"></A>I said that the permanent establishment of these things is very 
<A NAME="431"></A>difficult.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Shall I try and find some sort of persuasive argument which 
<A NAME="434"></A>will prove to you that such enactments are possible, and not beyond human 
<A NAME="435"></A>nature?
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Is a man more likely to abstain from the pleasures of love 
<A NAME="438"></A>and to do what he is bidden about them, when his body is in a good condition, 
<A NAME="439"></A>or when he is in an ill condition, and out of training?
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> He will be far more temperate when he is in 
<A NAME="441"></A>training.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And have we not heard of Iccus of Tarentum, who, with a 
<A NAME="443"></A>view to the Olympic and other contests, in his zeal for his art, ind also 
<A NAME="444"></A>because he was of a manly and temperate disposition, never had any connection 
<A NAME="445"></A>with a woman or a youth during the whole time of his training? And the 
<A NAME="446"></A>same is said of Crison and Astylus and Diopompus and many others; and yet, 
<A NAME="447"></A>Cleinias, they were far worse educated in their minds than your and my 
<A NAME="448"></A>citizens, and in their bodies far more lusty.
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> No doubt this fact has been often affirmed positively 
<A NAME="450"></A>by the ancients of these athletes.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR><B>Ath.</B> And had they; courage to abstain from what is ordinarilly 
<A NAME="452"></A>deemed a pleasure for the sake of a victory in wrestling, running, and 
<A NAME="453"></A>the like; and shall our young men be incapable of a similar endurance for 
<A NAME="454"></A>the sake of a much nobler victory, which is the noblest of all, as from 
<A NAME="455"></A>their youth upwards we will tell them, charming them, as we hope, into 
<A NAME="456"></A>the belief of this by tales and sayings and songs?
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Of what victory are you speaking?
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Of the victory over pleasure, which if they win, they will 
<A NAME="459"></A>live happily; or if they are conquered, the reverse of happily. And, further, 
<A NAME="460"></A>may we not suppose that the fear of impiety will enable them to master 
<A NAME="461"></A>that which other inferior people have mastered?
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I dare say.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> And since we have reached this point in our legislation, 
<A NAME="464"></A>and have fallen into a difficulty by reason of the vices of mankind, I 
<A NAME="465"></A>affirm that our ordinance should simply run in the following terms: Our 
<A NAME="466"></A>citizens ought not to fall below the nature of birds and beasts in general, 
<A NAME="467"></A>who are born in great multitudes, and yet remain until the age for procreation 
<A NAME="468"></A>virgin and unmarried, but when they have reached the proper time of life 
<A NAME="469"></A>are coupled, male and female, and lovingly pair together, and live the 
<A NAME="470"></A>rest of their lives in holiness and innocence, abiding firmly in their 
<A NAME="471"></A>original compact:-surely, we will say to them, you should be better than 
<A NAME="472"></A>the animals. But if they are corrupted by the other Hellenes and the common 
<A NAME="473"></A>practice of barbarians, and they see with their eyes and hear with their 
<A NAME="474"></A>ears of the so-called free love everywhere prevailing among them, and they 
<A NAME="475"></A>themselves are not able to get the better of the temptation, the guardians 
<A NAME="476"></A>of the law, exercising the functions of lawgivers, shall devise a second 
<A NAME="477"></A>law against them.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> And what law would you advise them to pass if this 
<A NAME="479"></A>one failed?
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Clearly, Cleinias, the one which would naturally 
<A NAME="481"></A>follow.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><B>Cle.</B> What is that?
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Our citizens should not allow pleasures to strengthen with 
<A NAME="484"></A>indulgence, but should by toil divert the aliment and exuberance of them 
<A NAME="485"></A>into other parts of the body; and this will happen if no immodesty be allowed 
<A NAME="486"></A>in the practice of love. Then they will be ashamed of frequent intercourse, 
<A NAME="487"></A>and they will find pleasure, if seldom enjoyed, to be a less imperious 
<A NAME="488"></A>mistress. They should not be found out doing anything of the sort. Concealment 
<A NAME="489"></A>shall be honourable, and sanctioned by custom and made law by unwritten 
<A NAME="490"></A>prescription; on the other hand, to be detected shall be esteemed dishonourable, 
<A NAME="491"></A>but not, to abstain wholly. In this way there will be a second legal standard 
<A NAME="492"></A>of honourable and dishonourable, involving a second notion of right. Three 
<A NAME="493"></A>principles will comprehend all those corrupt natures whom we call inferior 
<A NAME="494"></A>to themselves, and who form but one dass, and will compel them not to 
<A NAME="495"></A>transgress.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What are they?
<A NAME="497"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> The principle of piety, the love of honour, and the desire 
<A NAME="498"></A>of beauty, not in the body but in the soul. These are, perhaps, romantic 
<A NAME="499"></A>aspirations; but they are the noblest of aspirations, if they could only 
<A NAME="500"></A>be realized in all states, and, God willing, in the matter of love we may 
<A NAME="501"></A>be able to enforce one of two things-either that no one shall venture to 
<A NAME="502"></A>touch any person of the freeborn or noble class except his wedded wife, 
<A NAME="503"></A>or sow the unconsecrated and bastard seed among harlots, or in barren and 
<A NAME="504"></A>unnatural lusts; or at least we may abolish altogether the connection of 
<A NAME="505"></A>men with men; and as to women, if any man has to do with any but those 
<A NAME="506"></A>who come into his house duly married by sacred rites, whether they be bought 
<A NAME="507"></A>or acquired in any other way, and he offends publicly in the face of all 
<A NAME="508"></A>mankind, we shall be right in enacting that he be deprived of civic honours 
<A NAME="509"></A>and privileges, and be deemed to be, as he truly is, a stranger. Let this 
<A NAME="510"></A>law, then, whether it is one, or ought rather to be called two, be laid 
<A NAME="511"></A>down respecting love in general, and the intercourse of the sexes which 
<A NAME="512"></A>arises out of the desires, whether rightly or wrongly 
<A NAME="513"></A>indulged.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR>Meg. I, for my part, Stranger, would gladly receive this law. Cleinias 
<A NAME="515"></A>shall speak for himself, and tell you what is his opinion.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> I will, Megillus, when an opportunity offers; at present, 
<A NAME="517"></A>I think that we had better allow the Stranger to proceed with his 
<A NAME="518"></A>laws.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR><B>Meg.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> We had got about as far as the establishment of the common 
<A NAME="521"></A>tables, which in most places would be difficult, but in Crete no one would 
<A NAME="522"></A>think of introducing any other custom. There might arise a question about 
<A NAME="523"></A>the manner of them-whether they shall be such as they are here in Crete, 
<A NAME="524"></A>or such as they are in Lacedaemon,-or is there a third kind which may be 
<A NAME="525"></A>better than either of them? The answer to this question might be easily 
<A NAME="526"></A>discovered, but the discovery would do no great good, for at present they 
<A NAME="527"></A>are very well ordered.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>Leaving the common tables, we may therefore proceed to the means 
<A NAME="529"></A>of providing food. Now, in cities the means of life are gained in many 
<A NAME="530"></A>ways and from divers sources, and in general from two sources, whereas 
<A NAME="531"></A>our city has only one. For most of the Hellenes obtain their food from 
<A NAME="532"></A>sea and land, but our citizens from land only. And this makes the task 
<A NAME="533"></A>of the legislator less difficult-half as many laws will be enough, and 
<A NAME="534"></A>much less than half; and they will be of a kind better suited to free men. 
<A NAME="535"></A>For he has nothing to do with laws about shipowners and merchants and retailers 
<A NAME="536"></A>and innkeepers and tax collectors and mines and moneylending and compound 
<A NAME="537"></A>interest and innumerable other things-bidding good-bye to these, he gives 
<A NAME="538"></A>laws to husbandmen and shepherds and bee-keepers, and to the guardians 
<A NAME="539"></A>and superintendents of their implements; and he has already legislated 
<A NAME="540"></A>for greater matters, as for example, respecting marriage and the procreation 
<A NAME="541"></A>and nurture of children, and for education, and the establishment of offices-and 
<A NAME="542"></A>now he must direct his laws to those who provide food and labour in preparing 
<A NAME="543"></A>it.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR>Let us first of all, then, have a class of laws which shall be 
<A NAME="545"></A>called the laws of husbandmen. And let the first of them be the law of 
<A NAME="546"></A>Zeus, the god of boundaries. Let no one shift the boundary line either 
<A NAME="547"></A>of a fellow-citizen who is a neighbour, or, if he dwells at the extremity 
<A NAME="548"></A>of the land, of any stranger who is conterminous with him, considering 
<A NAME="549"></A>that this is truly "to move the immovable," and every one should be more 
<A NAME="550"></A>willing to move the largest rock which is not a landmark, than the least 
<A NAME="551"></A>stone which is the sworn mark of friendship and hatred between neighbours; 
<A NAME="552"></A>for Zeus, the god of kindred, is the witness of the citizen, and Zeus, 
<A NAME="553"></A>the god of strangers, of the stranger, and when aroused, terrible are the 
<A NAME="554"></A>wars which they stir up. He who obeys the law will never know the fatal 
<A NAME="555"></A>consequences of disobedience, but he who despises the law shall be liable 
<A NAME="556"></A>to a double penalty, the first coming from the Gods, and the second from 
<A NAME="557"></A>the law. For let no one wilfully remove the boundaries of his neighbour's 
<A NAME="558"></A>land, and if any one does, let him who will inform the landowners, and 
<A NAME="559"></A>let them bring him into court, and if he be convicted of re-dividing the 
<A NAME="560"></A>land by stealth or by force, let the court determine what he ought to suffer 
<A NAME="561"></A>or pay. In the next place, many small injuries done by neighbours to one 
<A NAME="562"></A>another, through their multiplication, may cause a weight of enmity, and 
<A NAME="563"></A>make neighbourhood a very disagreeable and bitter thing. Wherefore a man 
<A NAME="564"></A>ought to be very careful of committing any offence against his neighbour, 
<A NAME="565"></A>and especially of encroaching on his neighbour's land; for any man may 
<A NAME="566"></A>easily do harm, but not every man can do good to another. He who encroaches 
<A NAME="567"></A>on his neighbour's land, and transgresses his boundaries, shall make good 
<A NAME="568"></A>the damage, and, to cure him of his impudence and also of his meanness, 
<A NAME="569"></A>he shall pay a double penalty to the injured party. Of these and the like 
<A NAME="570"></A>matters the wardens of the country shall take cognizance, and be the judges 
<A NAME="571"></A>of them and assessors of the damage; in the more important cases, as has 
<A NAME="572"></A>been already said, the whole number of them belonging to any one of the 
<A NAME="573"></A>twelve divisions shall decide, and in the lesser cases the commanders: 
<A NAME="574"></A>or, again, if any one pastures his cattle on his neighbour's land, they 
<A NAME="575"></A>shall see the injury, and adjudge the penalty. And if any one, by decoying 
<A NAME="576"></A>the bees, gets possession of another's swarms, and draws them to himself 
<A NAME="577"></A>by making noises, he shall pay the damage; or if anyone sets fire to his 
<A NAME="578"></A>own wood and takes no care of his neighbour's property, he shall be fined 
<A NAME="579"></A>at the discretion of the magistrates. And if in planting he does not leave 
<A NAME="580"></A>a fair distance between his own and his neighbour's land, he shall be punished, 
<A NAME="581"></A>in accordance with the enactments of many law givers, which we may use, 
<A NAME="582"></A>not deeming it necessary that the great legislator of our state should 
<A NAME="583"></A>determine all the trifles which might be decided by any body; for example, 
<A NAME="584"></A>husbandmen have had of old excellent laws about waters, and there is no 
<A NAME="585"></A>reason why we should propose to divert their course: who likes may draw 
<A NAME="586"></A>water from the fountain-head of the common stream on to his own land, if 
<A NAME="587"></A>he do not cut off the spring which clearly belongs to some other owner; 
<A NAME="588"></A>and he may take the water in any direction which he pleases, except through 
<A NAME="589"></A>a house or temple or sepulchre, but he must be careful to do no harm beyond 
<A NAME="590"></A>the channel. And if there be in any place a natural dryness of the earth, 
<A NAME="591"></A>which keeps in the rain from heaven, and causes a deficiency in the supply 
<A NAME="592"></A>of water, let him dig down on his own land as far as the clay, and if at 
<A NAME="593"></A>this depth he finds no water, let him obtain water from his neighbours, 
<A NAME="594"></A>as much, as is required for his servants' drinking, and if his neighbours, 
<A NAME="595"></A>too, are limited in their supply, let him have a fixed measure, which shall 
<A NAME="596"></A>be determined by the wardens of the country. This he shall receive each 
<A NAME="597"></A>day, and on these terms have a share of his neighbours' water. If there 
<A NAME="598"></A>be heavy rain, and one of those on the lower ground injures some tiller 
<A NAME="599"></A>of the upper ground, or some one who has a common wall, by refusing to 
<A NAME="600"></A>give the man outlet for water; or, again, if some one living on the higher 
<A NAME="601"></A>ground recklessly lets off the water on his lower neighbour, and they cannot 
<A NAME="602"></A>come to terms with one another, let him who will call in a warden of the 
<A NAME="603"></A>city, if he be in the city, or if he be in the country, warden of the country, 
<A NAME="604"></A>and let him obtain a decision determining what each of them is to do. And 
<A NAME="605"></A>he who will not abide by the decision shall suffer for his malignant and 
<A NAME="606"></A>morose temper, and pay a fine to the injured party, equivalent to double 
<A NAME="607"></A>the value of the injury, because he was unwilling to submit to the 
<A NAME="608"></A>magistrates.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR>Now the participation of fruits shall be ordered on this wise. 
<A NAME="610"></A>The goddess of Autumn has two gracious gifts: one, the joy of Dionysus 
<A NAME="611"></A>which is not treasured up; the other, which nature intends to be stored. 
<A NAME="612"></A>Let this be the law, then, concerning the fruits of autumn: He who tastes 
<A NAME="613"></A>the common or storing fruits of autumn, whether grapes or figs, before 
<A NAME="614"></A>the season of vintage which coincides with Arcturus, either on his own 
<A NAME="615"></A>land or on that of others-let him pay fifty drachmae, which shall be sacred 
<A NAME="616"></A>to Dionysus, if he pluck them from his own land; and if from his neighbour's 
<A NAME="617"></A>land, a mina, and if from any others', two-thirds of a mina. And he who 
<A NAME="618"></A>would gather the "choice" grapes or the "choice" figs, as they are now 
<A NAME="619"></A>termed, if he take them off his own land, let him pluck them how and when 
<A NAME="620"></A>he likes; but if he take them from the ground of others without their leave, 
<A NAME="621"></A>let him in that case be always punished in accordance with the law which 
<A NAME="622"></A>ordains that he should not move what he has not laid down. And if a slave 
<A NAME="623"></A>touches any fruit of this sort, without the consent of the owner of the 
<A NAME="624"></A>land, he shall be beaten with as many blows as there are grapes on the 
<A NAME="625"></A>bunch, or figs on the fig-tree. Let a metic purchase the "choice" autumnal 
<A NAME="626"></A>fruit, and then, if he pleases, he may gather it; but if a stranger is 
<A NAME="627"></A>passing along the road, and desires to eat, let him take of the "choice" 
<A NAME="628"></A>grapes for himself and a single follower without payment, as a tribute 
<A NAME="629"></A>of hospitality. The law however forbids strangers from sharing in the sort 
<A NAME="630"></A>which is not used for eating; and if any one, whether he be master or slave, 
<A NAME="631"></A>takes of them in ignorance, let the slave be beaten, and the freeman dismissed 
<A NAME="632"></A>with admonitions, and instructed to take of the other autumnal fruits which 
<A NAME="633"></A>are unfit for making raisins and wine, or for laying by as dried figs. 
<A NAME="634"></A>As to pears, and apples, and pomegranates, and similar fruits, there shall 
<A NAME="635"></A>be no disgrace in taking them secretly; but he who is caught, if he be 
<A NAME="636"></A>of less than thirty years of age, shall be struck and beaten off, but not 
<A NAME="637"></A>wounded; and no freeman shall have any right of satisfaction for such blows. 
<A NAME="638"></A>Of these fruits the stranger may partake, just as he may of the fruits 
<A NAME="639"></A>of autumn. And if an elder, who is more than thirty years of age, eat of 
<A NAME="640"></A>them on the spot, let him, like the stranger, be allowed to partake of 
<A NAME="641"></A>all such fruits, but he must carry away nothing. If, however, he will not 
<A NAME="642"></A>obey the law, let him run risk of failing in the competition of virtue, 
<A NAME="643"></A>in case any one takes notice of his actions before the judges at the 
<A NAME="644"></A>time.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR>Water is the greatest element of nutrition in gardens, but is easily 
<A NAME="646"></A>polluted. You cannot poison the soil, or the soil, or the sun, or the air, 
<A NAME="647"></A>which are other elements of nutrition in plants, or divert them, or steal 
<A NAME="648"></A>them; but all these things may very likely happen in regard to water, which 
<A NAME="649"></A>must therefore be protected by law. And let this be the law:-If any one 
<A NAME="650"></A>intentionally pollutes the water of another, whether the water of a spring, 
<A NAME="651"></A>or collected in reservoirs, either by poisonous substances, or by digging 
<A NAME="652"></A>or by theft, let the injured party bring the cause before the wardens of 
<A NAME="653"></A>the city, and claim in writing the value of the loss; if the accused be 
<A NAME="654"></A>found guilty of injuring the water by deleterious substances, let him not 
<A NAME="655"></A>only pay damages, but purify the stream or the cistern which contains the 
<A NAME="656"></A>water, in such manner as the laws of the interpreters order the purification 
<A NAME="657"></A>to be made by the offender in each case.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>With respect to the gathering in of the fruits of the soil, let 
<A NAME="659"></A>a man, if he pleases, carry his own fruits through any place in which he 
<A NAME="660"></A>either does no harm to any one, or himself gains three times as much as 
<A NAME="661"></A>his neighbour loses. Now of these things the magistrates should be cognisant, 
<A NAME="662"></A>as of all other things in which a man intentionally does injury to another 
<A NAME="663"></A>or to the property of another, by fraud or force, in the use which he makes 
<A NAME="664"></A>of his own property. All these matters a man should lay before the magistrates, 
<A NAME="665"></A>and receive damages, supposing the injury to be not more than three minae; 
<A NAME="666"></A>or if he have a charge against another which involves a larger amount, 
<A NAME="667"></A>let him bring his suit into the public courts and have the evil-doer punished. 
<A NAME="668"></A>But if any of the magistrates appear to adjudge the penalties which he 
<A NAME="669"></A>imposes in an unjust spirit, let him be liable to pay double to the injured 
<A NAME="670"></A>party. Any one may bring the offences of magistrates, in any particular 
<A NAME="671"></A>case, before the public courts. There are innumerable little matters relating 
<A NAME="672"></A>to the modes of punishment, and applications for suits, and summonses and 
<A NAME="673"></A>the witnesses to summonses-for example, whether two witnesses should be 
<A NAME="674"></A>required for a summons, or how many-and all such details, which cannot 
<A NAME="675"></A>be omitted in legislation, but are beneath the wisdom of an aged legislator. 
<A NAME="676"></A>These lesser matters, as they indeed are in comparison with the greater 
<A NAME="677"></A>ones, let a younger generation regulate by law, after the patterns which 
<A NAME="678"></A>have preceded, and according to their own experience of the usefulness 
<A NAME="679"></A>and necessity of such laws; and when they are duly regulated let there 
<A NAME="680"></A>be no alteration, but let the citizens live in the observance of 
<A NAME="681"></A>them.
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><BR>Now of artisans, let the regulations be as follows:-In the first 
<A NAME="683"></A>place, let no citizen or servant of a citizen be occupied in handicraft 
<A NAME="684"></A>arts; for he who is to secure and preserve the public order of the state, 
<A NAME="685"></A>has an art which requires much study and many kinds of knowledge, and does 
<A NAME="686"></A>not admit of being made a secondary occupation; and hardly any human being 
<A NAME="687"></A>is capable of pursuing two professions or two arts rightly, or of practising 
<A NAME="688"></A>one art himself, and superintending some one else who is practising another. 
<A NAME="689"></A>Let this, then, be our first principle in the state:-No one who is a smith 
<A NAME="690"></A>shall also be a carpenter, and if he be a carpenter, he shall not superintend 
<A NAME="691"></A>the smith's art rather than his own, under the pretext that in superintending 
<A NAME="692"></A>many servants who are working for him, he is likely to superintend them 
<A NAME="693"></A>better, because more revenue will accrue to him from them than from his 
<A NAME="694"></A>own art; but let every man in the state have one art, and get his living 
<A NAME="695"></A>by that. Let the wardens of the city labour to maintain this law, and if 
<A NAME="696"></A>any citizen incline to any other art than the study of virtue, let them 
<A NAME="697"></A>punish him with disgrace and infamy, until they bring him back into his 
<A NAME="698"></A>own right course; and if any stranger profess two arts, let them chastise 
<A NAME="699"></A>him with bonds and money penalties, and expulsion from the state, until 
<A NAME="700"></A>they compel him to be one only and not many.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR>But as touching payments for hire, and contracts of work, or in 
<A NAME="702"></A>case any one does wrong to any of the citizens or they do wrong to any 
<A NAME="703"></A>other, up to fifty drachmae, let the wardens of the city decide the case; 
<A NAME="704"></A>but if greater amount be involved, then let the public courts decide according 
<A NAME="705"></A>to law. Let no one pay any duty either on the importation or exportation 
<A NAME="706"></A>of goods; and as to frankincense and similar perfumes, used in the service 
<A NAME="707"></A>of the Gods, which come from abroad, and purple and other dyes which are 
<A NAME="708"></A>not produced in the country, or the materials of any art which have to 
<A NAME="709"></A>be imported, and which are not necessary-no one should import them; nor 
<A NAME="710"></A>again, should any one export anything which is wanted in the country. Of 
<A NAME="711"></A>all these things let there be inspectors and superintendents, taken from 
<A NAME="712"></A>the guardians of the law; and they shall be the twelve next in order to 
<A NAME="713"></A>the five seniors. Concerning arms, and all implements which are for military 
<A NAME="714"></A>purposes, if there be need of introducing any art, or plant, or metal, 
<A NAME="715"></A>or chains of any kind, or animals for use in war, let the commanders of 
<A NAME="716"></A>the horse and the generals have authority over their importation and exportation; 
<A NAME="717"></A>the city shall send them out and also receive them, and the guardians of 
<A NAME="718"></A>the law shall make fit and proper laws about them. But let there be no 
<A NAME="719"></A>retail trade for the sake of money-making, either in these or any other 
<A NAME="720"></A>articles, in the city or country at all.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR>With respect to food and the distribution of the produce of the 
<A NAME="722"></A>country, the right and proper way seems to be nearly that which is the 
<A NAME="723"></A>custom of Crete; for all should be required to distribute the fruits of 
<A NAME="724"></A>the soil into twelve parts, and in this way consume them. Let the twelfth 
<A NAME="725"></A>portion of each (as for instance of wheat and barley, to which the rest 
<A NAME="726"></A>of the fruits of the earth shall be added, as well as the animals which 
<A NAME="727"></A>are for sale in each of the twelve divisions) be divided in due proportion 
<A NAME="728"></A>into three parts; one part for freemen, another for their servants, and 
<A NAME="729"></A>a third for craftsmen and in general for strangers, whether sojourners 
<A NAME="730"></A>who may be dwelling in the city, and like other men must live, or those 
<A NAME="731"></A>who come on some business which they have with the state, or with some 
<A NAME="732"></A>individual. Let only this third part of all necessaries be required to 
<A NAME="733"></A>be sold; out of the other two-thirds no one shall be compelled to sell. 
<A NAME="734"></A>And how will they be best distributed? In the first place, we see clearly 
<A NAME="735"></A>that the distribution will be of equals in one point of view, and in another 
<A NAME="736"></A>point of view of unequals.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> I mean that the earth of necessity produces and nourishes 
<A NAME="739"></A>the various articles of food, sometimes better and sometimes 
<A NAME="740"></A>worse.
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR><B>Cle.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><B>Ath.</B> Such being the case, let no one of the three portions be 
<A NAME="743"></A>greater than either of the other two-neither that which is assigned to 
<A NAME="744"></A>masters or to slaves, nor again that of the stranger; but let the distribution 
<A NAME="745"></A>to all be equal and alike, and let every citizen take his two portions 
<A NAME="746"></A>and distribute them among slaves and freemen, he having power to determine 
<A NAME="747"></A>the quantity and quality. And what remains he shall distribute by measure 
<A NAME="748"></A>and numb among the animals who have to be sustained from the earth, taking 
<A NAME="749"></A>the whole number of them.
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR>In the second place, our citizens should have separate houses duly 
<A NAME="751"></A>ordered, and this will be the order proper for men like them. There shall 
<A NAME="752"></A>be twelve hamlets, one in the middle of each twelfth portion, and in each 
<A NAME="753"></A>hamlet they shall first set apart a market-place, and the temples of the 
<A NAME="754"></A>Gods, and of their attendant demigods; and if there be any local deities 
<A NAME="755"></A>of the Magnetes, or holy seats of other ancient deities, whose memory has 
<A NAME="756"></A>been preserved, to these let them pay their ancient honours. But Hestia, 
<A NAME="757"></A>and Zeus, and Athene will have temples everywhere together with the God 
<A NAME="758"></A>who presides in each of the twelve districts. And the first erection of 
<A NAME="759"></A>houses shall be around these temples, where the ground is highest, in order 
<A NAME="760"></A>to provide the safest and most defensible place of retreat for the guards. 
<A NAME="761"></A>All the rest of the country they shall settle in the following manner:-They 
<A NAME="762"></A>shall make thirteen divisions of the craftsmen; one of them they shall 
<A NAME="763"></A>establish in the city, and this, again, they shall subdivide into twelve 
<A NAME="764"></A>lesser divisions, among the twelve districts of the city, and the remainder 
<A NAME="765"></A>shall be distributed in the country round about; and in each village they 
<A NAME="766"></A>shall settle various classes of craftsmen, with a view to the convenience 
<A NAME="767"></A>of the husbandmen. And the chief officers of the wardens of the country 
<A NAME="768"></A>shall superintend all these matters, and see how many of them, and which 
<A NAME="769"></A>class of them, each place requires; and fix them where they are likely 
<A NAME="770"></A>to be least troublesome, and most useful to the husbandman. And the wardens 
<A NAME="771"></A>of the city shall see to similar matters in the city.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR><BR>Now the wardens of the agora ought to see to the details of the 
<A NAME="773"></A>agora. Their first care, after the temples which are in the agora have 
<A NAME="774"></A>been seen to, should be to prevent any one from doing any in dealings between 
<A NAME="775"></A>man and man; in the second; place, as being inspectors of temperance and 
<A NAME="776"></A>violence, they should chastise him who requires chastisement. Touching 
<A NAME="777"></A>articles of gale, they should first see whether the articles which the 
<A NAME="778"></A>citizens are under regulations to sell to strangers are sold to them, as 
<A NAME="779"></A>the law ordains. And let the law be as follows:-on the first day of the 
<A NAME="780"></A>month, the persons in charge, whoever they are, whether strangers or slaves, 
<A NAME="781"></A>who have the charge on behalf of the citizens, shall produce to the strangers 
<A NAME="782"></A>the portion which falls to them, in the first place, a twelfth portion 
<A NAME="783"></A>of the corn;-the stranger shall purchase corn for the whole month, and 
<A NAME="784"></A>other cereals, on the first market day; and on the tenth day of the month 
<A NAME="785"></A>the one party shall sell, and the other buy, liquids sufficient to last 
<A NAME="786"></A>during the whole month; and on the twenty-third day there shall be a sale 
<A NAME="787"></A>of animals by those who are willing to sell to the people who want to buy, 
<A NAME="788"></A>and of implements and other things which husbandmen sell (such as skins 
<A NAME="789"></A>and all kinds of clothing, either woven or made of felt and other goods 
<A NAME="790"></A>of the same sort), and which strangers are compelled to buy and purchase 
<A NAME="791"></A>of others. As to the retail trade in these things, whether of barley or 
<A NAME="792"></A>wheat set apart for meal and flour, or any other kind of food, no one shall 
<A NAME="793"></A>sell them to citizens or their slaves, nor shall any one buy of a citizen; 
<A NAME="794"></A>but let the stranger sell them in the market of strangers, to artisans 
<A NAME="795"></A>and their slaves, making an exchange of wine and food, which is commonly 
<A NAME="796"></A>called retail trade. And butchers shall offer for sale parts of dismembered 
<A NAME="797"></A>animals to the strangers, and artisans, and their servants. Let any stranger 
<A NAME="798"></A>who likes buy fuel from day to day wholesale, from those who have the care 
<A NAME="799"></A>of it in the country, and let him sell to the strangers as much he pleases 
<A NAME="800"></A>and when he pleases. As to other goods and implements which are likely 
<A NAME="801"></A>to be wanted, they shall sell them in common market, at any place which 
<A NAME="802"></A>the guardians of the law and the wardens of the market and city, choosing 
<A NAME="803"></A>according to their judgment, shall determine; at such places they shall 
<A NAME="804"></A>exchange money for goods, and goods for money, neither party giving credit 
<A NAME="805"></A>to the other; and he who gives credit must be satisfied, whether he obtain 
<A NAME="806"></A>his money not, for in such exchanges he will not be protected by law. But 
<A NAME="807"></A>whenever property has been bought or sold, greater in quantity or value 
<A NAME="808"></A>than is allowed by the law, which has determined within what limited a 
<A NAME="809"></A>man may increase and diminish his possessions, let the excess be registered 
<A NAME="810"></A>in the books of the guardians of the law; in case of diminution, let there 
<A NAME="811"></A>be an erasure made. And let the same rule be observed about the registration 
<A NAME="812"></A>of the property of the metics. Any one who likes may come and be a metic 
<A NAME="813"></A>on certain conditions; a foreigner, if he likes, and is able to settle, 
<A NAME="814"></A>may dwell in the land, but he must practise an art, and not abide more 
<A NAME="815"></A>than twenty years from the time at which he has registered himself; and 
<A NAME="816"></A>he shall pay no sojourner's tax, however small, except good conduct, nor 
<A NAME="817"></A>any other tax for buying and selling. But when the twenty years have expired, 
<A NAME="818"></A>he shall take his property with him and depart. And if in the course of 
<A NAME="819"></A>these years he should chance to distinguish himself by any considerable 
<A NAME="820"></A>benefit which he confers on the state, and he thinks that he can persuade

<A NAME="827"></A>any of them who wishes to remain, may do so, if he can persuade the council 
<A NAME="828"></A>and assembly. And if he depart, let him erase all the entries which have 
<A NAME="829"></A>been made by him in the register kept by the magistrates.
