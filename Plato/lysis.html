A newly-erected Palaestra outside the walls of Athens.<BR></BLOCKQUOTE><HR SIZE="1" COLOR="990033" NOSHADE><BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>I was going from the Academy straight to the Lyceum, intending 
<A NAME="18"></A>to take the outer road, which is close under the wall. When I came to the 
<A NAME="19"></A>postern gate of the city, which is by the fountain of Panops, I fell in 
<A NAME="20"></A>with Hippothales, the son of Hieronymus, and Ctesippus the Paeanian, and 
<A NAME="21"></A>a company of young men who were standing with them. Hippothales, seeing 
<A NAME="22"></A>me approach, asked whence I came and whither I was going.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR>I am going, I replied, from the Academy straight to the 
<A NAME="24"></A>Lyceum.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Then come straight to us, he said, and put in here; you may as 
<A NAME="26"></A>well.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Who are you, I said; and where am I to come?
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>He showed me an enclosed space and an open door over against the wall. 
<A NAME="29"></A>And there, he said, is the building at which we all meet: and a goodly 
<A NAME="30"></A>company we are.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>And what is this building, I asked; and what sort of entertainment 
<A NAME="32"></A>have you?
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>The building, he replied, is a newly erected Palaestra; and the 
<A NAME="34"></A>entertainment is generally conversation, to which you are 
<A NAME="35"></A>welcome.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>Thank you, I said; and is there any teacher 
<A NAME="37"></A>there?
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Yes, he said, your old friend and admirer, Miccus.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Indeed, I replied; he is a very eminent professor.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Are you disposed, he said, to go with me and see 
<A NAME="41"></A>them?
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Yes, I said; but I should like to know first, what is expected of me, 
<A NAME="43"></A>and who is the favourite among you?
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>Some persons have one favourite, Socrates, and some another, he 
<A NAME="45"></A>said.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>And who is yours? I asked: tell me that, Hippothales.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>At this he blushed; and I said to him, O Hippothales, thou son of Hieronymus! 
<A NAME="48"></A>do not say that you are, or that you are not, in love; the confession is 
<A NAME="49"></A>too late; for I see that you are not only in love, but are already far 
<A NAME="50"></A>gone in your love. Simple and foolish as I am, the Gods have given me the 
<A NAME="51"></A>power of understanding affections of this kind.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>Whereupon he blushed more and more.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Ctesippus said: I like to see you blushing, Hippothales, and hesitating 
<A NAME="54"></A>to tell Socrates the name; when, if he were with you but for a very short 
<A NAME="55"></A>time, you would have plagued him to death by talking about nothing else. 
<A NAME="56"></A>Indeed, Socrates, he has literally deafened us, and stopped our ears with 
<A NAME="57"></A>the praises of Lysis; and if he is a little intoxicated, there is every 
<A NAME="58"></A>likelihood that we may have our sleep murdered with a cry of Lysis. His 
<A NAME="59"></A>performances in prose are bad enough, but nothing at all in comparison 
<A NAME="60"></A>with his verse; and when he drenches us with his poems and other compositions, 
<A NAME="61"></A>it is really too bad; and worse still is his manner of singing them to 
<A NAME="62"></A>his love; he has a voice which is truly appalling, and we cannot help hearing 
<A NAME="63"></A>him: and now having a question put to him by you, behold he is 
<A NAME="64"></A>blushing.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>Who is Lysis? I said: I suppose that he must be young; for the 
<A NAME="66"></A>name does not recall any one to me.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>Why, he said, his father being a very well known man, he retains 
<A NAME="68"></A>his patronymic, and is not as yet commonly called by his own name; but, 
<A NAME="69"></A>although you do not know his name, I am sure that you must know his face, 
<A NAME="70"></A>for that is quite enough to distinguish him.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>But tell me whose son he is, I said.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>He is the eldest son of Democrates, of the deme of 
<A NAME="73"></A>Aexone.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Ah, Hippothales, I said; what a noble and really perfect love you have 
<A NAME="75"></A>found! I wish that you would favour me with the exhibition which you have 
<A NAME="76"></A>been making to the rest of the company, and then I shall be able to judge 
<A NAME="77"></A>whether you know what a lover ought to say about his love, either to the 
<A NAME="78"></A>youth himself, or to others.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>Nay, Socrates, he said; you surely do not attach any importance 
<A NAME="80"></A>to what he is saying.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>Do you mean, I said, that you disown the love of the person whom 
<A NAME="82"></A>he says that you love?
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>No; but I deny that I make verses or address compositions to 
<A NAME="84"></A>him.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>He is not in his right mind, said Ctesippus; he is talking nonsense, 
<A NAME="86"></A>and is stark mad.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>O Hippothales, I said, if you have ever made any verses or songs 
<A NAME="88"></A>in honour of your favourite, I do not want to hear them; but I want to 
<A NAME="89"></A>know the purport of them, that I may be able to judge of your mode of approaching 
<A NAME="90"></A>your fair one.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>Ctesippus will be able to tell you, he said; for if, as he avers, 
<A NAME="92"></A>the sound of my words is always dinning in his ears, he must have a very 
<A NAME="93"></A>accurate knowledge and recollection of them.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>Yes, indeed, said Ctesippus; I know only too well; and very ridiculous 
<A NAME="95"></A>the tale is: for although he is a lover, and very devotedly in love, he 
<A NAME="96"></A>has nothing particular to talk about to his beloved which a child might 
<A NAME="97"></A>not say. Now is not that ridiculous? He can only speak of the wealth of 
<A NAME="98"></A>Democrates, which the whole city celebrates, and grandfather Lysis, and 
<A NAME="99"></A>the other ancestors of the youth, and their stud of horses, and their victory 
<A NAME="100"></A>at the Pythian games, and at the Isthmus, and at Nemea with four horses 
<A NAME="101"></A>and single horses-these are the tales which he composes and repeats. And 
<A NAME="102"></A>there is greater twaddle still. Only the day before yesterday he made a 
<A NAME="103"></A>poem in which he described the entertainment of Heracles, who was a connexion 
<A NAME="104"></A>of the family, setting forth how in virtue of this relationship he was 
<A NAME="105"></A>hospitably received by an ancestor of Lysis; this ancestor was himself 
<A NAME="106"></A>begotten of Zeus by the daughter of the founder of the deme. And these 
<A NAME="107"></A>are the sort of old wives' tales which he sings and recites to us, and 
<A NAME="108"></A>we are obliged to listen to him.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>When I heard this, I said: O ridiculous Hippothales! how can you 
<A NAME="110"></A>be making and singing hymns in honour of yourself before you have 
<A NAME="111"></A>won?
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>But my songs and verses, he said, are not in honour of myself, 
<A NAME="113"></A>Socrates.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>You think not? I said.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>Nay, but what do you think? he replied.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Most assuredly, I said, those songs are all in your own honour; for 
<A NAME="117"></A>if you win your beautiful love, your discourses and songs will be a glory, 
<A NAME="118"></A>to you, and may be truly regarded as hymns of praise composed in honour 
<A NAME="119"></A>of you who have conquered and won such a love; but if he slips away from 
<A NAME="120"></A>you, the more you have praised him, the more ridiculous you will look at 
<A NAME="121"></A>having lost this fairest and best of blessings; and therefore the wise 
<A NAME="122"></A>lover does not praise his beloved until he has won him, because he is afraid 
<A NAME="123"></A>of accidents. There is also another danger; the fair, when any one praises 
<A NAME="124"></A>or magnifies them, are filled with the spirit of pride and vain-glory. 
<A NAME="125"></A>Do you not agree with me?
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>And the more vain-glorious they are, the more difficult is the capture 
<A NAME="128"></A>of them?
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>I believe you.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>What should you say of a hunter who frightened away his prey, and made 
<A NAME="131"></A>the capture of the animals which he is hunting more 
<A NAME="132"></A>difficult?
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>He would be a bad hunter, undoubtedly.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Yes; and if, instead of soothing them, he were to infuriate them with 
<A NAME="135"></A>words and songs, that would show a great want of wit: do you not 
<A NAME="136"></A>agree.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>And now reflect, Hippothales, and see whether you are not guilty of 
<A NAME="139"></A>all these errors in writing poetry. For I can hardly suppose that you will 
<A NAME="140"></A>affirm a man to be a good poet who injures himself by his 
<A NAME="141"></A>poetry.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>Assuredly not, he said; such a poet would be a fool. And this is 
<A NAME="143"></A>the reason why I take you into my counsels, Socrates, and I shall be glad 
<A NAME="144"></A>of any further advice which you may have to offer. Will you tell me by 
<A NAME="145"></A>what words or actions I may become endeared to my love?
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>That is not easy to determine, I said; but if you will bring your 
<A NAME="147"></A>love to me, and will let me talk with him, I may perhaps be able to show 
<A NAME="148"></A>you how to converse with him, instead of singing and reciting in the fashion 
<A NAME="149"></A>of which you are accused.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>There will be no difficulty in bringing him, he replied; if you 
<A NAME="151"></A>will only go with Ctesippus into the Palaestra, and sit down and talk, 
<A NAME="152"></A>I believe that he will come of his own accord; for he is fond of listening, 
<A NAME="153"></A>Socrates. And as this is the festival of the Hermaea, the young men and 
<A NAME="154"></A>boys are all together, and there is no separation between them. He will 
<A NAME="155"></A>be sure to come: but if he does not, Ctesippus with whom he is familiar, 
<A NAME="156"></A>and whose relation Menexenus is his great friend, shall call 
<A NAME="157"></A>him.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>That will be the way, I said. Thereupon I led Ctesippus into the 
<A NAME="159"></A>Palaestra, and the rest followed.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>Upon entering we found that the boys had just been sacrificing; 
<A NAME="161"></A>and this part of the festival was nearly at an end. They were all in their 
<A NAME="162"></A>white array, and games at dice were going on among them. Most of them were 
<A NAME="163"></A>in the outer court amusing themselves; but some were in a corner of the 
<A NAME="164"></A>Apodyterium playing at odd and even with a number of dice, which they took 
<A NAME="165"></A>out of little wicker baskets. There was also a circle of lookers-on; among 
<A NAME="166"></A>them was Lysis. He was standing with the other boys and youths, having 
<A NAME="167"></A>a crown upon his head, like a fair vision, and not less worthy of praise 
<A NAME="168"></A>for his goodness than for his beauty. We left them, and went over to the 
<A NAME="169"></A>opposite side of the room, where, finding a quiet place, we sat down; and 
<A NAME="170"></A>then we began to talk. This attracted Lysis, who was constantly turning 
<A NAME="171"></A>round to look at us -he was evidently wanting to come to us. For a time 
<A NAME="172"></A>he hesitated and had not the courage to come alone; but first of all, his 
<A NAME="173"></A>friend Menexenus, leaving his play, entered the Palaestra from the court, 
<A NAME="174"></A>and when he saw Ctesippus and myself, was going to take a seat by us; and 
<A NAME="175"></A>then Lysis, seeing him, followed, and sat down by his side; and the other 
<A NAME="176"></A>boys joined. I should observe that Hippothales, when he saw the crowd, 
<A NAME="177"></A>got behind them, where he thought that he would be out of sight of Lysis, 
<A NAME="178"></A>lest he should anger him; and there he stood and listened.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>I turned to Menexenus, and said: Son of Demophon, which of you 
<A NAME="180"></A>two youths is the elder?
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>That is a matter of dispute between us, he said.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>And which is the nobler? Is that also a matter of 
<A NAME="183"></A>dispute?
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>Yes, certainly.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>And another disputed point is, which is the fairer?
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>The two boys laughed.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>I shall not ask which is the richer of the two, I said; for you are 
<A NAME="188"></A>friends, are you not?
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, they replied.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>And friends have all things in common, so that one of you can be no 
<A NAME="191"></A>richer than the other, if you say truly that you are 
<A NAME="192"></A>friends.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>They assented. I was about to ask which was the juster of the two, 
<A NAME="194"></A>and which was the wiser of the two; but at this moment Menexenus was called 
<A NAME="195"></A>away by some one who came and said that the gymnastic-master wanted him. 
<A NAME="196"></A>I supposed that he had to offer sacrifice. So he went away, and I asked 
<A NAME="197"></A>Lysis some more questions. I dare say, Lysis, I said, that your father 
<A NAME="198"></A>and mother love you very much.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>And they would wish you to be perfectly happy.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>But do you think that any one is happy who is in the condition of a 
<A NAME="203"></A>slave, and who cannot do what he likes?
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>I should think not indeed, he said.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>And if your father and mother love you, and desire that you should 
<A NAME="206"></A>be happy, no one can doubt that they are very ready to promote your 
<A NAME="207"></A>happiness.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he replied.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>And do they then permit you to do what you like, and never rebuke you 
<A NAME="210"></A>or hinder you from doing what you desire?
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>Yes, indeed, Socrates; there are a great many things which they 
<A NAME="212"></A>hinder me from doing.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean? I said. Do they want you to be happy, and yet 
<A NAME="214"></A>hinder you from doing what you like? For example, if you want to mount 
<A NAME="215"></A>one of your father's chariots, and take the reins at a race, they will 
<A NAME="216"></A>not allow you to do so-they will prevent you?
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said, they will not allow me to do 
<A NAME="218"></A>so.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Whom then will they allow?
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>There is a charioteer, whom my father pays for driving.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>And do they trust a hireling more than you? and may he do what he likes 
<A NAME="222"></A>with the horses? and do they pay him for this?
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>They do.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>But I dare say that you may take the whip and guide the mule-cart if 
<A NAME="225"></A>you like;-they will permit that?
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>Permit me! indeed they will not.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Then, I said, may no one use the whip to the mules?
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>Yes, he said, the muleteer.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>And is he a slave or a free man?
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>A slave, he said.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>And do they esteem a slave of more value than you who are their son? 
<A NAME="232"></A>And do they entrust their property to him rather than to you? and allow 
<A NAME="233"></A>him to do what he likes, when they prohibit you? Answer me now: Are you 
<A NAME="234"></A>your own master, or do they not even allow that?
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>Nay, he said; of course they do not allow it.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Then you have a master?
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Yes, my tutor; there he is.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>And is he a slave?
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>To be sure; he is our slave, he replied.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Surely, I said, this is a strange thing, that a free man should be 
<A NAME="241"></A>governed by a slave. And what does he do with you?
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>He takes me to my teachers.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>You do not mean to say that your teachers also rule over 
<A NAME="244"></A>you?
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Of course they do.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Then I must say that your father is pleased to inflict many lords and 
<A NAME="247"></A>masters on you. But at any rate when you go home to your mother, she will 
<A NAME="248"></A>let you have your own way, and will not interfere with your happiness; 
<A NAME="249"></A>her wool, or the piece of cloth which she is weaving, are at your disposal: 
<A NAME="250"></A>I am sure that there is nothing to hinder you from touching her wooden 
<A NAME="251"></A>spathe, or her comb, or any other of her spinning implements.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>Nay, Socrates, he replied, laughing; not only does she hinder me, 
<A NAME="253"></A>but I should be beaten if I were to touch one of them.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>Well, I said, this is amazing. And did you ever behave ill to your 
<A NAME="255"></A>father or your mother?
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>No, indeed, he replied.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>But why then are they so terribly anxious to prevent you from being 
<A NAME="258"></A>happy, and doing as you like?-keeping you all day long in subjection to 
<A NAME="259"></A>another, and, in a word, doing nothing which you desire; so that you have 
<A NAME="260"></A>no good, as would appear, out of their great possessions, which are under 
<A NAME="261"></A>the control of anybody rather than of you, and have no use of your own 
<A NAME="262"></A>fair person, which is tended and taken care of by another; while you, Lysis, 
<A NAME="263"></A>are master of nobody, and can do nothing?
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>Why, he said, Socrates, the reason is that I am not of 
<A NAME="265"></A>age.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>I doubt whether that is the real reason, I said; for I should imagine 
<A NAME="267"></A>that your father Democrates, and your mother, do permit you to do many 
<A NAME="268"></A>things already, and do not wait until you are of age: for example, if they 
<A NAME="269"></A>want anything read or written, you, I presume, would be the first person 
<A NAME="270"></A>in the house who is summoned by them.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>And you would be allowed to write or read the letters in any order 
<A NAME="273"></A>which you please, or to take up the lyre and tune the notes, and play with 
<A NAME="274"></A>the fingers, or strike with the plectrum, exactly as you please, and neither 
<A NAME="275"></A>father nor mother would interfere with you.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>That is true, he said.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Then what can be the reason, Lysis, I said, why they allow you to do 
<A NAME="278"></A>the one and not the other?
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>I suppose, he said, because I understand the one, and not the 
<A NAME="280"></A>other.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Yes, my dear youth, I said, the reason is not any deficiency of years, 
<A NAME="282"></A>but a deficiency of knowledge; and whenever your father thinks that you 
<A NAME="283"></A>are wiser than he is, he will instantly commit himself and his possessions 
<A NAME="284"></A>to you.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>I think so.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Aye, I said; and about your neighbour, too, does not the same rule 
<A NAME="287"></A>hold as about your father? If he is satisfied that you know more of housekeeping 
<A NAME="288"></A>than he does, will he continue to administer his affairs himself, or will 
<A NAME="289"></A>he commit them to you?
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>I think that he will commit them to me.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Will not the Athenian people, too, entrust their affairs to you when 
<A NAME="292"></A>they see that you have wisdom enough to manage them?
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>And oh! let me put another case, I said: There is the great king, and 
<A NAME="295"></A>he has an eldest son, who is the Prince of Asia;-suppose that you and I 
<A NAME="296"></A>go to him and establish to his satisfaction that we are better cooks than 
<A NAME="297"></A>his son, will he not entrust to us the prerogative of making soup, and 
<A NAME="298"></A>putting in anything that we like while the pot is boiling, rather than 
<A NAME="299"></A>to the Prince of Asia, who is his son?
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>To us, clearly.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>And we shall be allowed to throw in salt by handfuls, whereas the son 
<A NAME="302"></A>will not be allowed to put in as much as he can take up between his 
<A NAME="303"></A>fingers?
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Or suppose again that the son has bad eyes, will he allow him, or will 
<A NAME="306"></A>he not allow him, to touch his own eyes if he thinks that he has no knowledge 
<A NAME="307"></A>of medicine?
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>He will not allow him.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Whereas, if he supposes us to have a knowledge of medicine, he will 
<A NAME="310"></A>allow us to do what we like with him-even to open the eyes wide and sprinkle 
<A NAME="311"></A>ashes upon them, because he supposes that we know what is 
<A NAME="312"></A>best?
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>And everything in which we appear to him to be wiser than himself or 
<A NAME="315"></A>his son he will commit to us?
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>That is very true, Socrates, he replied.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Then now, my dear Lysis, I said, you perceive that in things which 
<A NAME="318"></A>we know every one will trust us-Hellenes and barbarians, men and women-and 
<A NAME="319"></A>we may do as we please about them, and no one will like to interfere with 
<A NAME="320"></A>us; we shall be free, and masters of others; and these things will be really 
<A NAME="321"></A>ours, for we shall be benefited by them. But in things of which we have 
<A NAME="322"></A>no understanding, no one will trust us to do as seems good to us-they will 
<A NAME="323"></A>hinder us as far as they can; and not only strangers, but father and mother, 
<A NAME="324"></A>and the friend, if there be one, who is dearer still, will also hinder 
<A NAME="325"></A>us; and we shall be subject to others; and these things will not be ours, 
<A NAME="326"></A>for we shall not be benefited by them. Do you agree?
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>He assented.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>And shall we be friends to others, and will any others love us, in 
<A NAME="329"></A>as far as we are useless to them?
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Neither can your father or mother love you, nor can anybody love anybody 
<A NAME="332"></A>else, in so far as they are useless to them?
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>No.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>And therefore, my boy, if you are wise, -all men will be your friends 
<A NAME="335"></A>and kindred, for you will be useful and good; but if you are not wise, 
<A NAME="336"></A>neither father, nor mother, nor kindred, nor any one else, will be your 
<A NAME="337"></A>friends. And in matters of which you have as yet no knowledge, can you 
<A NAME="338"></A>have any conceit of knowledge?
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>That is impossible, he replied.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>And you, Lysis, if you require a teacher, have not yet attained to 
<A NAME="341"></A>wisdom.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>And therefore you are not conceited, having nothing of which to be 
<A NAME="344"></A>conceited.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, Socrates, I think not.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>When I heard him say this, I turned to Hippothales, and was very nearly 
<A NAME="347"></A>making a blunder, for I was going to say to him: That is the way, Hippothales, 
<A NAME="348"></A>in which you should talk to your beloved, humbling and lowering him, and 
<A NAME="349"></A>not as you do, puffing him up and spoiling him. But I saw that he was in 
<A NAME="350"></A>great excitement and confusion at what had been said, and I remembered 
<A NAME="351"></A>that, although he was in the neighbourhood, he did not want to be seen 
<A NAME="352"></A>by Lysis; so upon second thoughts I refrained.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>In the meantime Menexenus came back and sat down in his place by 
<A NAME="354"></A>Lysis; and Lysis, in a childish and affectionate manner, whispered privately 
<A NAME="355"></A>in my ear, so that Menexenus should not hear: Do, Socrates, tell Menexenus 
<A NAME="356"></A>what you have been telling me.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>Suppose that you tell him yourself, Lysis, I replied; for I am 
<A NAME="358"></A>sure that you were attending.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he replied.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Try, then, to remember the words, and be as exact as you can in repeating 
<A NAME="361"></A>them to him, and if you have forgotten anything, ask me again the next 
<A NAME="362"></A>time that you see me.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>I will be sure to do so, Socrates; but go on telling him something 
<A NAME="364"></A>new, and let me hear, as long as I am allowed to stay.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>I certainly cannot refuse, I said, since you ask me; but then, 
<A NAME="366"></A>as you know, Menexenus is very pugnacious, and therefore you must come 
<A NAME="367"></A>to the rescue if he attempts to upset me.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>Yes, indeed, he said; he is very pugnacious, and that is the reason 
<A NAME="369"></A>why I want you to argue with him.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>That I may make a fool of myself?
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>No, indeed, he said; but I want you to put him down.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>That is no easy matter, I replied; for he is a terrible fellow-a pupil 
<A NAME="373"></A>of Ctesippus. And there is Ctesippus himself: do you see 
<A NAME="374"></A>him?
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>Never mind, Socrates, you shall argue with him.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Well, I suppose that I must, I replied.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Hereupon Ctesippus complained that we were talking in secret, and keeping 
<A NAME="378"></A>the feast to ourselves.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>I shall be happy, I said, to let you have a share. Here is Lysis, 
<A NAME="380"></A>who does not understand something that I was saying, and wants me to ask 
<A NAME="381"></A>Menexenus, who, as he thinks, is likely to know.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>And why do you not ask him? he said.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Very well, I said, I will; and do you, Menexenus, answer. But first 
<A NAME="384"></A>I must tell you that I am one who from my childhood upward have set my 
<A NAME="385"></A>heart upon a certain thing. All people have their fancies; some desire 
<A NAME="386"></A>horses, and others dogs; and some are fond of gold, and others of honour. 
<A NAME="387"></A>Now, I have no violent desire of any of these things; but I have a passion 
<A NAME="388"></A>for friends; and I would rather have a good friend than the best cock or 
<A NAME="389"></A>quail in the world: I would even go further, and say the best horse or 
<A NAME="390"></A>dog. Yea, by the dog of Egypt, I should greatly prefer a real friend to 
<A NAME="391"></A>all the gold of Darius, or even to Darius himself: I am such a lover of 
<A NAME="392"></A>friends as that. And when I see you and Lysis, at your early age, so easily 
<A NAME="393"></A>possessed of this treasure, and so soon, he of you, and you of him, I am 
<A NAME="394"></A>amazed and delighted, seeing that I myself, although I am now advanced 
<A NAME="395"></A>in years, am so far from having made a similar acquisition, that I do not 
<A NAME="396"></A>even know in what way a friend is acquired. But want to ask you a question 
<A NAME="397"></A>about this, for you have experience: tell me then, when one loves another, 
<A NAME="398"></A>is the lover or the beloved the friend; or may either be the 
<A NAME="399"></A>friend?
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>Either may, I should think, be the friend of 
<A NAME="401"></A>either.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>Do you mean, I said, that if only one of them loves the other, they 
<A NAME="403"></A>are mutual friends?
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; that is my meaning.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>But what if the lover is not loved in return? which is a very possible 
<A NAME="406"></A>case.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Or is, perhaps, even hated? which is a fancy which sometimes is entertained 
<A NAME="409"></A>by lovers respecting their beloved. Nothing can exceed their love; and 
<A NAME="410"></A>yet they imagine either that they are not loved in return, or that they 
<A NAME="411"></A>are hated. Is not that true?
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, quite true.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>In that case, the one loves, and the other is loved?
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Then which is the friend of which? Is the lover the friend of the beloved, 
<A NAME="416"></A>whether he be loved in return, or hated; or is the beloved the friend; 
<A NAME="417"></A>or is there no friendship at all on either side, unless they both love 
<A NAME="418"></A>one another?
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>There would seem to be none at all.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Then this notion is not in accordance with our previous one. We were 
<A NAME="421"></A>saying that both were friends, if one only loved; but now, unless they 
<A NAME="422"></A>both love, neither is a friend.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>That appears to be true.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Then nothing which does not love in return is beloved by a 
<A NAME="425"></A>lover?
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>I think not.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Then they are not lovers of horses, whom the horses do not love in 
<A NAME="428"></A>return; nor lovers of quails, nor of dogs, nor of wine, nor of gymnastic 
<A NAME="429"></A>exercises, who have no return of love; no, nor of wisdom, unless wisdom 
<A NAME="430"></A>loves them in return. Or shall we say that they do love them, although 
<A NAME="431"></A>they are not beloved by them; and that the poet was wrong who 
<A NAME="432"></A>sings-
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>Happy the man to whom his children are dear, and steeds having 
<A NAME="434"></A>single hoofs, and dogs of chase, and the stranger of another 
<A NAME="435"></A>land?
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>I do not think that he was wrong.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>You think that he is right?
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Then, Menexenus, the conclusion is, that what is beloved, whether loving 
<A NAME="440"></A>or hating, may be dear to the lover of it: for example, very young children, 
<A NAME="441"></A>too young to love, or even hating their father or mother when they are 
<A NAME="442"></A>punished by them, are never dearer to them than at the time when they are 
<A NAME="443"></A>being hated by them.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>I think that what you say is true.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>And, if so, not the lover, but the beloved, is the friend or dear 
<A NAME="446"></A>one?
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>And the hated one, and not the hater, is the enemy?
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>Then many men are loved by their enemies, and hated by their friends, 
<A NAME="451"></A>and are the friends of their enemies, and the enemies of their friends. 
<A NAME="452"></A>Yet how absurd, my dear friend, or indeed impossible is this paradox of 
<A NAME="453"></A>a man being an enemy to his friend or a friend to his 
<A NAME="454"></A>enemy.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>I quite agree, Socrates, in what you say.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>But if this cannot be, the lover will be the friend of that which is 
<A NAME="457"></A>loved?
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>And the hater will be the enemy of that which is 
<A NAME="460"></A>hated?
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Yet we must acknowledge in this, as in the preceding instance, that 
<A NAME="463"></A>a man may be the friend of one who is not his friend, or who may be his 
<A NAME="464"></A>enemy, when he loves that which does not love him or which even hates him. 
<A NAME="465"></A>And he may be the enemy of one who is not his enemy, and is even his friend: 
<A NAME="466"></A>for example, when he hates that which does not hate him, or which even 
<A NAME="467"></A>loves him.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR>That appears to be true.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>But if the lover is not a friend, nor the beloved a friend, nor both 
<A NAME="470"></A>together, what are we to say? Whom are we to call friends to one another? 
<A NAME="471"></A>Do any remain?
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, Socrates, I cannot find any.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>But, O Menexenus! I said, may we not have been altogether wrong in 
<A NAME="474"></A>our conclusions?
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR>I am sure that we have been wrong, Socrates, said Lysis. And he 
<A NAME="476"></A>blushed as he spoke, the words seeming to come from his lips involuntarily, 
<A NAME="477"></A>because his whole mind was taken up with the argument; there was no mistaking 
<A NAME="478"></A>his attentive look while he was listening.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>I was pleased at the interest which was shown by Lysis, and I wanted 
<A NAME="480"></A>to give Menexenus a rest, so I turned to him and said, I think, Lysis, 
<A NAME="481"></A>that what you say is true, and that, if we had been right, we should never 
<A NAME="482"></A>have gone so far wrong; let us proceed no further in this direction (for 
<A NAME="483"></A>the road seems to be getting troublesome), but take the other path into 
<A NAME="484"></A>which we turned, and see what the poets have to say; for they are to us 
<A NAME="485"></A>in a manner the fathers and authors of wisdom, and they speak of friends 
<A NAME="486"></A>in no light or trivial manner, but God himself, as they say, makes them 
<A NAME="487"></A>and draws them to one another; and this they express, if I am not mistaken, 
<A NAME="488"></A>in the following words:-
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR>God is ever drawing like towards like, and
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>making them acquainted. I dare say that you have heard those 
<A NAME="491"></A>words.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; I have.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>And have you not also met with the treatises of philosophers who say 
<A NAME="494"></A>that like must love like? they are the people who argue and write about 
<A NAME="495"></A>nature and the universe.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he replied.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>And are they right in saying this?
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>They may be.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Perhaps, I said, about half, or possibly, altogether, right, if their 
<A NAME="500"></A>meaning were rightly apprehended by us. For the more a bad man has to do 
<A NAME="501"></A>with a bad man, and the more nearly he is brought into contact with him, 
<A NAME="502"></A>the more he will be likely to hate him, for he injures him; and injurer 
<A NAME="503"></A>and injured cannot be friends. Is not that true?
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Then one half of the saying is untrue, if the wicked are like one 
<A NAME="506"></A>another?
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>But the real meaning of the saying, as I imagine, is, that, the good 
<A NAME="509"></A>are like one another, friends to one another; and that the bad, as is often 
<A NAME="510"></A>said of them, are never at unity with one another or with themselves; for 
<A NAME="511"></A>they are passionate and restless, and anything which is at variance and 
<A NAME="512"></A>enmity with itself is not likely to be in union or harmony with any other 
<A NAME="513"></A>thing. Do you not agree?
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I do.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Then, my friend, those who say that the like is friendly to the like 
<A NAME="516"></A>mean to intimate, if I rightly apprehend them, that the good only is the 
<A NAME="517"></A>friend of the good, and of him only; but that the evil never attains to 
<A NAME="518"></A>any real friendship, either with good or evil. Do you 
<A NAME="519"></A>agree?
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>He nodded assent.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Then now we know how to answer the question "Who are friends? for the 
<A NAME="522"></A>argument declares "That the good are friends."
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that is true.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Yes, I replied; and yet I am not quite satisfied with this answer. 
<A NAME="525"></A>By heaven, and shall I tell you what I suspect? I will. Assuming that like, 
<A NAME="526"></A>inasmuch as he is like, is the friend of like, and useful to him-or rather 
<A NAME="527"></A>let me try another way of putting the matter: Can like do any good or harm 
<A NAME="528"></A>to like which he could not do to himself, or suffer anything from his like 
<A NAME="529"></A>which he would not suffer from himself? And if neither can be of any use 
<A NAME="530"></A>to the other, how can they be loved by one another? Can they 
<A NAME="531"></A>now?
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR>They cannot.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>And can he who is not loved be a friend?
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>But say that the like is not the friend of the like in so far as he 
<A NAME="536"></A>is like; still the good may be the friend of the good in so far as he is 
<A NAME="537"></A>good?
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>But then again, will not the good, in so far as he is good, be sufficient 
<A NAME="540"></A>for himself? Certainly he will. And he who is sufficient wants nothing-that 
<A NAME="541"></A>is implied in the word sufficient.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>Of course not.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>And he who wants nothing will desire nothing?
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>He will not.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Neither can he love that which he does not desire?
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>He cannot.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>And he who not is not a lover of friend?
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Clearly not.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>What place then is there for friendship, if, when absent, good men 
<A NAME="550"></A>have no need of one another (for even when alone they are sufficient for 
<A NAME="551"></A>themselves), and when present have no use of one another? How can such 
<A NAME="552"></A>persons ever be induced to value one another?
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>They cannot.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>And friends they cannot be, unless they value one 
<A NAME="555"></A>another?
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>But see now, Lysis, whether we are not being deceived in all this-are 
<A NAME="558"></A>we not indeed entirely wrong?
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>How so? he replied.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>Have I not heard some one say, as I just now recollect, that the like 
<A NAME="561"></A>is the greatest enemy of the like, the good of the good?-Yes, and he quoted 
<A NAME="562"></A>the authority of Hesiod, who says:
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>Potter quarrels with potter, hard with bard,
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Beggar with beggar; and of all other things he affirmed, in like manner, 
<A NAME="565"></A>"That of necessity the most like are most full of envy, strife, and hatred 
<A NAME="566"></A>of one another, and the most unlike, of friendship. For the poor man is 
<A NAME="567"></A>compelled to be the friend of the rich, and the weak requires the aid of 
<A NAME="568"></A>the strong, and the sick man of the physician; and every one who is ignorant, 
<A NAME="569"></A>has to love and court him who knows." And indeed he went on to say in grandiloquent 
<A NAME="570"></A>language, that the idea of friendship existing between similars is not 
<A NAME="571"></A>the truth, but the very reverse of the truth, and that the most opposed 
<A NAME="572"></A>are the most friendly; for that everything desires not like but that which 
<A NAME="573"></A>is most unlike: for example, the dry desires the moist, the cold the hot, 
<A NAME="574"></A>the bitter the sweet, the sharp the blunt, the void the full, the full 
<A NAME="575"></A>the void, and so of all other things; for the opposite is the food of the 
<A NAME="576"></A>opposite, whereas like receives nothing from like. And I thought that he 
<A NAME="577"></A>who said this was a charming man, and that he spoke well. What do the rest 
<A NAME="578"></A>of you say?
<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR>I should say, at first hearing, that he is right, said 
<A NAME="580"></A>Menexenus.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Then we are to say that the greatest friendship is of 
<A NAME="582"></A>opposites?
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>Yes, Menexenus; but will not that be a monstrous answer? and will not 
<A NAME="585"></A>the all-wise eristics be down upon us in triumph, and ask, fairly enough, 
<A NAME="586"></A>whether love is not the very opposite of hate; and what answer shall we 
<A NAME="587"></A>make to them-must we not admit that they speak the truth?
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR>We must.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>They will then proceed to ask whether the enemy is the friend of the 
<A NAME="590"></A>friend, or the friend the friend of the enemy?
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR>Neither, he replied.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Well, but is a just man the friend of the unjust, or the temperate 
<A NAME="593"></A>of the intemperate, or the good of the bad?
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR>I do not see how that is possible.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>And yet, I said, if friendship goes by contraries, the contraries must 
<A NAME="596"></A>be friends.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>They must.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Then neither like and like nor unlike and unlike are 
<A NAME="599"></A>friends.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>I suppose not.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>And yet there is a further consideration: may not all these notions 
<A NAME="602"></A>of friendship be erroneous? but may not that which is neither good nor 
<A NAME="603"></A>evil still in some cases be the friend of the good?
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR>How do you mean? he said.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Why really, I said, the truth is that I do not know; but my head is 
<A NAME="606"></A>dizzy with thinking of the argument, and therefore I hazard the conjecture, 
<A NAME="607"></A>that "the beautiful is the friend," as the old proverb says. Beauty is 
<A NAME="608"></A>certainly a soft, smooth, slippery thing, and therefore of a nature which 
<A NAME="609"></A>easily slips in and permeates our souls. For I affirm that the good is 
<A NAME="610"></A>the beautiful. You will agree to that?
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>This I say from a sort of notion that what is neither good nor evil 
<A NAME="613"></A>is the friend of the beautiful and the good, and I will tell you why I 
<A NAME="614"></A>am inclined to think so: I assume that there are three principles-the good, 
<A NAME="615"></A>the bad, and that which is neither good nor bad. You would agree-would 
<A NAME="616"></A>you not?
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR>I agree.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>And neither is the good the friend of the good, nor the evil of the 
<A NAME="619"></A>good, nor the good of the evil;-these alternatives are excluded by the 
<A NAME="620"></A>previous argument; and therefore, if there be such a thing as friendship 
<A NAME="621"></A>or love at all, we must infer that what is neither good nor evil must be 
<A NAME="622"></A>the friend, either of the good, or of that which is neither good nor evil, 
<A NAME="623"></A>for nothing can be the friend of the bad.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>But neither can like be the friend of like, as we were just now 
<A NAME="626"></A>saying.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>And if so, that which is neither good nor evil can have no friend which 
<A NAME="629"></A>is neither good nor evil.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>Clearly not.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Then the good alone is the friend of that only which is neither good 
<A NAME="632"></A>nor evil.
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>That may be assumed to be certain.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>And does not this seem to put us in the right way? Just remark, that 
<A NAME="635"></A>the body which is in health requires neither medical nor any other aid, 
<A NAME="636"></A>but is well enough; and the healthy man has no love of the physician, because 
<A NAME="637"></A>he is in health.
<A NAME="638"></A><BR><BR>He has none.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>But the sick loves him, because he is sick?
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>And sickness is an evil, and the art of medicine a good and useful 
<A NAME="642"></A>thing?
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>But the human body, regarded as a body, is neither good nor 
<A NAME="645"></A>evil?
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>And the body is compelled by reason of disease to court and make friends 
<A NAME="648"></A>of the art of medicine?
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Then that which is neither good nor evil becomes the friend of good, 
<A NAME="651"></A>by reason of the presence of evil?
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>So we may infer.
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>And clearly this must have happened before that which was neither good 
<A NAME="654"></A>nor evil had become altogether corrupted with the element of evil-if itself 
<A NAME="655"></A>had become evil it would not still desire and love the good; for, as we 
<A NAME="656"></A>were saying, the evil cannot be the friend of the good.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Further, I must observe that some substances are assimilated when others 
<A NAME="659"></A>are present with them; and there are some which are not assimilated: take, 
<A NAME="660"></A>for example, the case of an ointment or colour which is put on another 
<A NAME="661"></A>substance.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>Very good.
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>In such a case, is the substance which is anointed the same as the 
<A NAME="664"></A>colour or ointment?
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean? he said.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>This is what I mean: Suppose that I were to cover your auburn locks 
<A NAME="667"></A>with white lead, would they be really white, or would they only appear 
<A NAME="668"></A>to be white?
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>They would only appear to be white, he replied.
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>And yet whiteness would be present in them?
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>But that would not make them at all the more white, notwithstanding 
<A NAME="673"></A>the presence of white in them-they would not be white any more than 
<A NAME="674"></A>black?
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR>No.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>But when old age infuses whiteness into them, then they become assimilated, 
<A NAME="677"></A>and are white by the presence of white.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Now I want to know whether in all cases a substance is assimilated 
<A NAME="680"></A>by the presence of another substance; or must the presence be after a peculiar 
<A NAME="681"></A>sort?
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><BR>The latter, he said.
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>Then that which is neither good nor evil may be in the presence of 
<A NAME="684"></A>evil, but not as yet evil, and that has happened before 
<A NAME="685"></A>now?
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>And when anything is in the presence of evil, not being as yet evil, 
<A NAME="688"></A>the presence of good arouses the desire of good in that thing; but the 
<A NAME="689"></A>presence of evil, which makes a thing evil, takes away the desire and friendship 
<A NAME="690"></A>of the good; for that which was once both good and evil has now become 
<A NAME="691"></A>evil only, and the good was supposed to have no friendship with the 
<A NAME="692"></A>evil?
<A NAME="693"></A><BR><BR>None.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>And therefore we say that those who are already wise, whether Gods 
<A NAME="695"></A>or men, are no longer lovers of wisdom; nor can they be lovers of wisdom 
<A NAME="696"></A>who are ignorant to the extent of being evil, for no evil or ignorant person 
<A NAME="697"></A>is a lover of wisdom. There remain those who have the misfortune to be 
<A NAME="698"></A>ignorant, but are not yet hardened in their ignorance, or void of understanding, 
<A NAME="699"></A>and do not as yet fancy that they know what they do not know: and therefore 
<A NAME="700"></A>those who are the lovers of wisdom are as yet neither good nor bad. But 
<A NAME="701"></A>the bad do not love wisdom any more than the good; for, as we have already 
<A NAME="702"></A>seen, neither is unlike the friend of unlike, nor like of like. You remember 
<A NAME="703"></A>that?
<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR>Yes, they both said.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>And so, Lysis and Menexenus, we have discovered the nature of friendship-there 
<A NAME="706"></A>can be no doubt of it: Friendship is the love which by reason of the presence 
<A NAME="707"></A>of evil the neither good nor evil has of the good, either in the soul, 
<A NAME="708"></A>or in the body, or anywhere.
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR>They both agreed and entirely assented, and for a moment I rejoiced 
<A NAME="710"></A>and was satisfied like a huntsman just holding fast his prey. But then 
<A NAME="711"></A>a most unaccountable suspicion came across me, and I felt that the conclusion 
<A NAME="712"></A>was untrue. I was pained, and said, Alas! Lysis and Menexenus, I am afraid 
<A NAME="713"></A>that we have been grasping at a shadow only.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR><BR>Why do you say so? said Menexenus.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>I am afraid, I said, that the argument about friendship is false: arguments, 
<A NAME="716"></A>like men, are often pretenders.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR>How do you mean? he asked.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Well, I said; look at the matter in this way: a friend is the friend 
<A NAME="719"></A>of some one; is he not?
<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR>Certainly he is.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>And has he a motive and object in being a friend, or has he no motive 
<A NAME="722"></A>and object?
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>He has a motive and object.
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>And is the object which makes him a friend, dear to him, neither dear 
<A NAME="725"></A>nor hateful to him?
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><BR>I do not quite follow you, he said.
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>I do not wonder at that, I said. But perhaps, if I put the matter in 
<A NAME="728"></A>another way, you will be able to follow me, and my own meaning will be 
<A NAME="729"></A>clearer to myself. The sick man, as I was just now saying, is the friend 
<A NAME="730"></A>of the physician-is he not?
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>And he is the friend of the physician because of disease, and for the 
<A NAME="733"></A>sake of health?
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>And disease is an evil?
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>And what of health? I said. Is that good or evil, or 
<A NAME="738"></A>neither?
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>Good, he replied.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>And we were saying, I believe, that the body being neither good nor 
<A NAME="741"></A>evil, because of disease, that is to say because of evil, is the friend 
<A NAME="742"></A>of medicine, and medicine is a good: and medicine has entered into this 
<A NAME="743"></A>friendship for the sake of health, and health is a good.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>And is health a friend, or not a friend?
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>A friend.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>And disease is an enemy?
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Then that which is neither good nor evil is the friend of the good 
<A NAME="750"></A>because of the evil and hateful, and for the sake of the good and the 
<A NAME="751"></A>friend?
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Then the friend is a friend for the sake of the friend, and because 
<A NAME="754"></A>of the enemy?
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR>That is to be inferred.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>Then at this point, my boys, let us take heed, and be on our guard 
<A NAME="757"></A>against deceptions. I will not again repeat that the friend is the friend 
<A NAME="758"></A>of the friend, and the like of the like, which has been declared by us 
<A NAME="759"></A>to be an impossibility; but, in order that this new statement may not delude 
<A NAME="760"></A>us, let us attentively examine another point, which I will proceed to explain: 
<A NAME="761"></A>Medicine, as we were saying, is a friend, dear to us for the sake of 
<A NAME="762"></A>health?
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>And health is also dear?
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>And if dear, then dear for the sake of something?
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>And surely this object must also be dear, as is implied in our previous 
<A NAME="769"></A>admissions?
<A NAME="770"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>And that something dear involves something else 
<A NAME="772"></A>dear?
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>But then, proceeding in this way, shall we not arrive at some first 
<A NAME="775"></A>principle of friendship or dearness which is not capable of being referred 
<A NAME="776"></A>to any other, for the sake of which, as we maintain, all other things are 
<A NAME="777"></A>dear, and, having there arrived, we shall stop?
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>My fear is that all those other things, which, as we say, are dear 
<A NAME="780"></A>for the sake of another, are illusions and deceptions only, but where that 
<A NAME="781"></A>first principle is, there is the true ideal of friendship. Let me put the 
<A NAME="782"></A>matter thus: Suppose the case of a great treasure (this may be a son, who 
<A NAME="783"></A>is more precious to his father than all his other treasures); would not 
<A NAME="784"></A>the father, who values his son above all things, value other things also 
<A NAME="785"></A>for the sake of his son? I mean, for instance, if he knew that his son 
<A NAME="786"></A>had drunk hemlock, and the father thought that wine would save him, he 
<A NAME="787"></A>would value the wine?
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR>He would.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>And also the vessel which contains the wine?
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>But does he therefore value the three measures of wine, or the earthen 
<A NAME="792"></A>vessel which contains them, equally with his son? Is not this rather the 
<A NAME="793"></A>true state of the case? All his anxiety has regard not to the means which 
<A NAME="794"></A>are provided for the sake of an object, but to the object for the sake 
<A NAME="795"></A>of which they are provided. And although we may often say that gold and 
<A NAME="796"></A>silver are highly valued by us, that is not the truth; for there is a further 
<A NAME="797"></A>object, whatever it may be, which we value most of all, and for the sake 
<A NAME="798"></A>of which gold and all out other possessions are acquired by us. Am I not 
<A NAME="799"></A>right?
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR>Yes, certainly.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>And may not the same be said of the friend? That which is only dear 
<A NAME="802"></A>to us for the sake of something else is improperly said to be dear, but 
<A NAME="803"></A>the truly dear is that in which all these so called dear friendships 
<A NAME="804"></A>terminate.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>That, he said, appears to be true.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>And the truly dear or ultimate principle of friendship is not for the 
<A NAME="807"></A>sake of any other or further dear.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>Then we have done with the notion that friendship has any further object. 
<A NAME="810"></A>May we then infer that the good is the friend?
<A NAME="811"></A><BR><BR>I think so.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>And the good is loved for the sake of the evil? Let me put the case 
<A NAME="813"></A>in this way: Suppose that of the three principles, good, evil, and that 
<A NAME="814"></A>which is neither good nor evil, there remained only the good and the neutral, 
<A NAME="815"></A>and that evil went far away, and in no way affected soul or body, nor ever 
<A NAME="816"></A>at all that class of things which, as we say, are neither good nor evil 
<A NAME="817"></A>in themselves;-would the good be of any use, or other than useless to us? 
<A NAME="818"></A>For if there were nothing to hurt us any longer, we should have no need 
<A NAME="819"></A>of anything that would do us good. Then would be clearly seen that we did 
<A NAME="820"></A>but love and desire the good because of the evil, and as the remedy of 
<A NAME="821"></A>the evil, which was the disease; but if there had been no disease, there 
<A NAME="822"></A>would have been no need of a remedy. Is not this the nature of the good-to 
<A NAME="823"></A>be loved by us who are placed between the two, because of the evil? but 
<A NAME="824"></A>there is no use in the good for its own sake.
<A NAME="825"></A><BR><BR>I suppose not.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>Then the final principle of friendship, in which all other friendships 
<A NAME="827"></A>terminated, those, I mean, which are relatively dear and for the sake of 
<A NAME="828"></A>something else, is of another and a different nature from them. For they 
<A NAME="829"></A>are called dear because of another dear or friend. But with the true friend 
<A NAME="830"></A>or dear, the case is quite the reverse; for that is proved to be dear because 
<A NAME="831"></A>of the hated, and if the hated were away it would be no longer 
<A NAME="832"></A>dear.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he replied: at any rate not if our present view holds 
<A NAME="834"></A>good.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>But, oh! will you tell me, I said, whether if evil were to perish, 
<A NAME="836"></A>we should hunger any more, or thirst any more, or have any similar desire? 
<A NAME="837"></A>Or may we suppose that hunger will remain while men and animals remain, 
<A NAME="838"></A>but not so as to be hurtful? And the same of thirst and the other desires,-that 
<A NAME="839"></A>they will remain, but will not be evil because evil has perished? Or rather 
<A NAME="840"></A>shall I say, that to ask what either will be then or will not be is ridiculous, 
<A NAME="841"></A>for who knows? This we do know, that in our present condition hunger may 
<A NAME="842"></A>injure us, and may also benefit us:-Is not that true?
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>And in like manner thirst or any similar desire may sometimes be a 
<A NAME="845"></A>good and sometimes an evil to us, and sometimes neither one nor the 
<A NAME="846"></A>other?
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><BR>To be sure.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>But is there any reason why, because evil perishes, that which is not 
<A NAME="849"></A>evil should perish with it?
<A NAME="850"></A><BR><BR>None.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>Then, even if evil perishes, the desires which are neither good nor 
<A NAME="852"></A>evil will remain?
<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR>Clearly they will.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>And must not a man love that which he desires and 
<A NAME="855"></A>affects?
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>He must.
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>Then, even if evil perishes, there may still remain some elements of 
<A NAME="858"></A>love or friendship?
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>But not if evil is the cause of friendship: for in that case nothing 
<A NAME="861"></A>will be the friend of any other thing after the destruction of evil; for 
<A NAME="862"></A>the effect cannot remain when the cause is destroyed.
<A NAME="863"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>And have we not admitted already that the friend loves something for 
<A NAME="865"></A>a reason? and at the time of making the admission we were of opinion that 
<A NAME="866"></A>the neither good nor evil loves the good because of the 
<A NAME="867"></A>evil?
<A NAME="868"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>But now our view is changed, and we conceive that there must be some 
<A NAME="870"></A>other cause of friendship?
<A NAME="871"></A><BR><BR>I suppose so.
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>May not the truth be rather, as we were saying just now, that desire 
<A NAME="873"></A>is the cause of friendship; for that which desires is dear to that which 
<A NAME="874"></A>is desired at the time of desiring it? and may not the other theory have 
<A NAME="875"></A>been only a long story about nothing?
<A NAME="876"></A><BR><BR>Likely enough.
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>But surely, I said, he who desires, desires that of which he is in 
<A NAME="878"></A>want?
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>And that of which he is in want is dear to him?
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>And he is in want of that of which he is deprived?
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>Then love, and desire, and friendship would appear to be of the natural 
<A NAME="885"></A>or congenial. Such, Lysis and Menexenus, is the inference.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR><BR>They assented.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>Then if you are friends, you must have natures which are congenial 
<A NAME="888"></A>to one another?
<A NAME="889"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, they both said.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>And I say, my boys, that no one who loves or desires another would 
<A NAME="891"></A>ever have loved or desired or affected him, if he had not been in some 
<A NAME="892"></A>way congenial to him, either in his soul, or in his character, or in his 
<A NAME="893"></A>manners, or in his form.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR><BR>Yes, yes, said Menexenus. But Lysis was silent.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>Then, I said, the conclusion is, that what is of a congenial nature 
<A NAME="896"></A>must be loved.
<A NAME="897"></A><BR><BR>It follows, he said.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>Then the lover, who is true and no counterfeit, must of necessity be 
<A NAME="899"></A>loved by his love.
<A NAME="900"></A><BR><BR>Lysis and Menexenus gave a faint assent to this; and Hippothales 
<A NAME="901"></A>changed into all manner of colours with delight.
<A NAME="902"></A><BR><BR>Here, intending to revise the argument, I said: Can we point out 
<A NAME="903"></A>any difference between the congenial and the like? For if that is possible, 
<A NAME="904"></A>then I think, Lysis and Menexenus, there may be some sense in our argument 
<A NAME="905"></A>about friendship. But if the congenial is only the like, how will you get 
<A NAME="906"></A>rid of the other argument, of the uselessness of like to like in as far 
<A NAME="907"></A>as they are like; for to say that what is useless is dear, would be absurd? 
<A NAME="908"></A>Suppose, then, that we agree to distinguish between the congenial and the 
<A NAME="909"></A>like-in the intoxication of argument, that may perhaps be 
<A NAME="910"></A>allowed.
<A NAME="911"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>And shall we further say that the good is congenial, and the evil uncongenial 
<A NAME="913"></A>to every one? Or again that the evil is congenial to the evil, and the 
<A NAME="914"></A>good to the good; and that which is neither good nor evil to that which 
<A NAME="915"></A>is neither good nor evil?
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR>They agreed to the latter alternative.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>Then, my boys, we have again fallen into the old discarded error; for 
<A NAME="918"></A>the unjust will be the friend of the unjust, and the bad of the bad, as 
<A NAME="919"></A>well as the good of the good.
<A NAME="920"></A><BR><BR>That appears to be the result.
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>But again, if we say that the congenial is the same as the good, in 
<A NAME="922"></A>that case the good and he only will be the friend of the 
<A NAME="923"></A>good.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>But that too was a position of ours which, as you will remember, has 
<A NAME="926"></A>been already refuted by ourselves.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR>We remember.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>Then what is to be done? Or rather is there anything to be done? I 
<A NAME="929"></A>can only, like the wise men who argue in courts, sum up the arguments:-If 
<A NAME="930"></A>neither the beloved, nor the lover, nor the like, nor the unlike, nor the 
<A NAME="931"></A>good, nor the congenial, nor any other of whom we spoke-for there were 
<A NAME="932"></A>such a number of them that I cannot remember all-if none of these are friends, 
<A NAME="933"></A>I know not what remains to be said.
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR>Here I was going to invite the opinion of some older person, when 
<A NAME="935"></A>suddenly we were interrupted by the tutors of Lysis and Menexenus, who 
<A NAME="936"></A>came upon us like an evil apparition with their brothers, and bade them 
<A NAME="937"></A>go home, as it was getting late. At first, we and the bystanders drove 
<A NAME="938"></A>them off; but afterwards, as they would not mind, and only went on shouting 
<A NAME="939"></A>in their barbarous dialect, and got angry, and kept calling the boys-they 
<A NAME="940"></A>appeared to us to have been drinking rather too much at the Hermaea, which 
<A NAME="941"></A>made them difficult to manage we fairly gave way and broke up the 
<A NAME="942"></A>company.
<A NAME="943"></A><BR><BR>I said, however, a few words to the boys at parting: O Menexenus 
<A NAME="944"></A>and Lysis, how ridiculous that you two boys, and I, an old boy, who would 
<A NAME="945"></A>fain be one of you, should imagine ourselves to be friends-this is what 
<A NAME="946"></A>the by-standers will go away and say-and as yet we have not been able to 
<A NAME="947"></A>discover what is a friend!
