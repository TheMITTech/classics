<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR><B>Hermogenes.</B> Suppose that we make Socrates a party to the 
<A NAME="15"></A>argument?
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR><B>Cratylus.</B> If you please.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I should explain to you, Socrates, that our friend 
<A NAME="18"></A>Cratylus has been arguing about names; he says that they are natural and 
<A NAME="19"></A>not conventional; not a portion of the human voice which men agree to use; 
<A NAME="20"></A>but that there is a truth or correctness in them, which is the same for 
<A NAME="21"></A>Hellenes as for barbarians. Whereupon I ask him, whether his own name of 
<A NAME="22"></A>Cratylus is a true name or not, and he answers "Yes." And Socrates? "Yes." 
<A NAME="23"></A>Then every man's name, as I tell him, is that which he is called. To this 
<A NAME="24"></A>he replies- "If all the world were to call you Hermogenes, that would not 
<A NAME="25"></A>be your name." And when I am anxious to have a further explanation he is 
<A NAME="26"></A>ironical and mysterious, and seems to imply that he has a notion of his 
<A NAME="27"></A>own about the matter, if he would only tell, and could entirely convince 
<A NAME="28"></A>me, if he chose to be intelligible. Tell me, Socrates, what this oracle 
<A NAME="29"></A>means; or rather tell me, if you will be so good, what is your own view 
<A NAME="30"></A>of the truth or correctness of names, which I would far sooner 
<A NAME="31"></A>hear.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR><B>Socrates.</B> Son of Hipponicus, there is an ancient saying, 
<A NAME="33"></A>that "hard is the knowledge of the good." And the knowledge of names is 
<A NAME="34"></A>a great part of knowledge. If I had not been poor, I might have heard the 
<A NAME="35"></A>fifty-drachma course of the great Prodicus, which is a complete education 
<A NAME="36"></A>in grammar and language- these are his own words- and then I should have 
<A NAME="37"></A>been at once able to answer your question about the correctness of names. 
<A NAME="38"></A>But, indeed, I have only heard the single-drachma course, and therefore, 
<A NAME="39"></A>I do not know the truth about such matters; I will, however, gladly assist 
<A NAME="40"></A>you and Cratylus in the investigation of them. When he declares that your 
<A NAME="41"></A>name is not really Hermogenes, I suspect that he is only making fun of 
<A NAME="42"></A>you;- he means to say that you are no true son of Hermes, because you are 
<A NAME="43"></A>always looking after a fortune and never in luck. But, as I was saying, 
<A NAME="44"></A>there is a good deal of difficulty in this sort of knowledge, and therefore 
<A NAME="45"></A>we had better leave the question open until we have heard both 
<A NAME="46"></A>sides.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I have often talked over this matter, both with Cratylus 
<A NAME="48"></A>and others, and cannot convince myself that there is any principle of correctness 
<A NAME="49"></A>in names other than convention and agreement; any name which you give, 
<A NAME="50"></A>in my opinion, is the right one, and if you change that and give another, 
<A NAME="51"></A>the new name is as correct as the old- we frequently change the names of 
<A NAME="52"></A>our slaves, and the newly-imposed name is as good as the old: for there 
<A NAME="53"></A>is no name given to anything by nature; all is convention and habit of 
<A NAME="54"></A>the users;- such is my view. But if I am mistaken I shall be happy to hear 
<A NAME="55"></A>and learn of Cratylus, or of any one else.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I dare say that you be right, Hermogenes: let us see;- 
<A NAME="57"></A>Your meaning is, that the name of each thing is only that which anybody 
<A NAME="58"></A>agrees to call it?
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> That is my notion.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Whether the giver of the name be an individual or a 
<A NAME="61"></A>city?
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, now, let me take an instance;- suppose that I 
<A NAME="64"></A>call a man a horse or a horse a man, you mean to say that a man will be 
<A NAME="65"></A>rightly called a horse by me individually, and rightly called a man by 
<A NAME="66"></A>the rest of the world; and a horse again would be rightly called a man 
<A NAME="67"></A>by me and a horse by the world:- that is your meaning?
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> He would, according to my view.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But how about truth, then? you would acknowledge that 
<A NAME="70"></A>there is in words a true and a false?
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And there are true and false propositions?
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And a true proposition says that which is, and a false 
<A NAME="75"></A>proposition says that which is not?
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes; what other answer is possible?
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then in a proposition there is a true and 
<A NAME="78"></A>false?
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But is a proposition true as a whole only, and are 
<A NAME="81"></A>the parts untrue?
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> No; the parts are true as well as the 
<A NAME="83"></A>whole.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Would you say the large parts and not the smaller ones, 
<A NAME="85"></A>or every part?
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I should say that every part is 
<A NAME="87"></A>true.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Is a proposition resolvable into any part smaller than 
<A NAME="89"></A>a name?
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> No; that is the smallest.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then the name is a part of the true 
<A NAME="92"></A>proposition?
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, and a true part, as you say.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is not the part of a falsehood also a 
<A NAME="97"></A>falsehood?
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, if propositions may be true and false, names 
<A NAME="100"></A>may be true and false?
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> So we must infer.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the name of anything is that which any one affirms 
<A NAME="103"></A>to be the name?
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And will there be so many names of each thing as everybody 
<A NAME="106"></A>says that there are? and will they be true names at the time of uttering 
<A NAME="107"></A>them?
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes, Socrates, I can conceive no correctness of names 
<A NAME="109"></A>other than this; you give one name, and I another; and in different cities 
<A NAME="110"></A>and countries there are different names for the same things; Hellenes differ 
<A NAME="111"></A>from barbarians in their use of names, and the several Hellenic tribes 
<A NAME="112"></A>from one another.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But would you say, Hermogenes, that the things differ 
<A NAME="114"></A>as the names differ? and are they relative to individuals, as Protagoras 
<A NAME="115"></A>tells us? For he says that man is the measure of all things, and that things 
<A NAME="116"></A>are to me as they appear to me, and that they are to you as they appear 
<A NAME="117"></A>to you. Do you agree with him, or would you say that things have a permanent 
<A NAME="118"></A>essence of their own?
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> There have been times, Socrates, when I have been driven 
<A NAME="120"></A>in my perplexity to take refuge with Protagoras; not that I agree with 
<A NAME="121"></A>him at all.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What! have you ever been driven to admit that there 
<A NAME="123"></A>was no such thing as a bad man?
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> No, indeed; but I have often had reason to think that 
<A NAME="125"></A>there are very bad men, and a good many of them.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, and have you ever found any very good 
<A NAME="127"></A>ones?
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Not many.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Still you have found them?
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And would you hold that the very good were the very 
<A NAME="132"></A>wise, and the very evil very foolish? Would that be your 
<A NAME="133"></A>view?
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> It would.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But if Protagoras is right, and the truth is that things 
<A NAME="136"></A>are as they appear to any one, how can some of us be wise and some of us 
<A NAME="137"></A>foolish?
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Impossible.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if, on the other hand, wisdom and folly are really 
<A NAME="140"></A>distinguishable, you will allow, I think, that the assertion of Protagoras 
<A NAME="141"></A>can hardly be correct. For if what appears to each man is true to him, 
<A NAME="142"></A>one man cannot in reality be wiser than another.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> He cannot.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Nor will you be disposed to say with Euthydemus, that 
<A NAME="145"></A>all things equally belong to all men at the same moment and always; for 
<A NAME="146"></A>neither on his view can there be some good and other bad, if virtue and 
<A NAME="147"></A>vice are always equally to be attributed to all.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> There cannot.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But if neither is right, and things are not relative 
<A NAME="150"></A>to individuals, and all things do not equally belong to all at the same 
<A NAME="151"></A>moment and always, they must be supposed to have their own proper and permanent 
<A NAME="152"></A>essence: they are not in relation to us, or influenced by us, fluctuating 
<A NAME="153"></A>according to our fancy, but they are independent, and maintain to their 
<A NAME="154"></A>own essence the relation prescribed by nature.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I think, Socrates, that you have said the 
<A NAME="156"></A>truth.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Does what I am saying apply only to the things themselves, 
<A NAME="158"></A>or equally to the actions which proceed from them? Are not actions also 
<A NAME="159"></A>a class of being?
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes, the actions are real as well as the 
<A NAME="161"></A>things.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then the actions also are done according to their proper 
<A NAME="163"></A>nature, and not according to our opinion of them? In cutting, for example, 
<A NAME="164"></A>we do not cut as we please, and with any chance instrument; but we cut 
<A NAME="165"></A>with the proper instrument only, and according to the natural process of 
<A NAME="166"></A>cutting; and the natural process is right and will succeed, but any other 
<A NAME="167"></A>will fail and be of no use at all.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I should say that the natural way is the right 
<A NAME="169"></A>way.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Again, in burning, not every way is the right way; 
<A NAME="171"></A>but the right way is the natural way, and the right instrument the natural 
<A NAME="172"></A>instrument.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> True.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And this holds good of all actions?
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And speech is a kind of action?
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> True.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And will a man speak correctly who speaks as he pleases? 
<A NAME="179"></A>Will not the successful speaker rather be he who speaks in the natural 
<A NAME="180"></A>way of speaking, and as things ought to be spoken, and with the natural 
<A NAME="181"></A>instrument? Any other mode of speaking will result in error and 
<A NAME="182"></A>failure.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I quite agree with you.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is not naming a part of speaking? for in giving 
<A NAME="185"></A>names men speak.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> That is true.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if speaking is a sort of action and has a relation 
<A NAME="188"></A>to acts, is not naming also a sort of action?
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> True.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And we saw that actions were not relative to ourselves, 
<A NAME="191"></A>but had a special nature of their own?
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Precisely.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then the argument would lead us to infer that names 
<A NAME="194"></A>ought to be given according to a natural process, and with a proper instrument, 
<A NAME="195"></A>and not at our pleasure: in this and no other way shall we name with 
<A NAME="196"></A>success.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I agree.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But again, that which has to be cut has to be cut with 
<A NAME="199"></A>something?
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And that which has to be woven or pierced has to be 
<A NAME="202"></A>woven or pierced with something?
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And that which has to be named has to be named with 
<A NAME="205"></A>something?
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> True.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What is that with which we pierce?
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> An awl.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And with which we weave?
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> A shuttle.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And with which we name?
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> A name.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Very good: then a name is an instrument?
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Suppose that I ask, "What sort of instrument is a shuttle?" 
<A NAME="216"></A>And you answer, "A weaving instrument."
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Well.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And I ask again, "What do we do when we weave?"- The 
<A NAME="219"></A>answer is, that we separate or disengage the warp from the 
<A NAME="220"></A>woof.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And may not a similar description be given of an awl, 
<A NAME="223"></A>and of instruments in general?
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And now suppose that I ask a similar question about 
<A NAME="226"></A>names: will you answer me? Regarding the name as an instrument, what do 
<A NAME="227"></A>we do when we name?
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I cannot say.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do we not give information to one another, and distinguish 
<A NAME="230"></A>things according to their natures?
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Certainly we do.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then a name is an instrument of teaching and of distinguishing 
<A NAME="233"></A>natures, as the shuttle is of distinguishing the threads of the 
<A NAME="234"></A>web.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the shuttle is the instrument of the 
<A NAME="237"></A>weaver?
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Assuredly.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then the weaver will use the shuttle well- and well 
<A NAME="240"></A>means like a weaver? and the teacher will use the name well- and well means 
<A NAME="241"></A>like a teacher?
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And when the weaver uses the shuttle, whose work will 
<A NAME="244"></A>he be using well?
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> That of the carpenter.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is every man a carpenter, or the skilled 
<A NAME="247"></A>only?
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Only the skilled.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And when the piercer uses the awl, whose work will 
<A NAME="250"></A>he be using well?
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> That of the smith.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is every man a smith, or only the 
<A NAME="253"></A>skilled?
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> The skilled only.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And when the teacher uses the name, whose work will 
<A NAME="256"></A>he be using?
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> There again I am puzzled.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Cannot you at least say who gives us the names which 
<A NAME="259"></A>we use?
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Indeed I cannot.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Does not the law seem to you to give us 
<A NAME="262"></A>them?
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes, I suppose so.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then the teacher, when he gives us a name, uses the 
<A NAME="265"></A>work of the legislator?
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I agree.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is every man a legislator, or the skilled 
<A NAME="268"></A>only?
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> The skilled only.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, Hermogenes, not every man is able to give a name, 
<A NAME="271"></A>but only a maker of names; and this is the legislator, who of all skilled 
<A NAME="272"></A>artisans in the world is the rarest.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> True.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And how does the legislator make names? and to what 
<A NAME="275"></A>does he look? Consider this in the light of the previous instances: to 
<A NAME="276"></A>what does the carpenter look in making the shuttle? Does he not look to 
<A NAME="277"></A>that which is naturally fitted to act as a shuttle?
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And suppose the shuttle to be broken in making, will 
<A NAME="280"></A>he make another, looking to the broken one? or will he look to the form 
<A NAME="281"></A>according to which he made the other?
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> To the latter, I should imagine.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Might not that be justly called the true or ideal 
<A NAME="284"></A>shuttle?
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I think so.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR><B>SOC.</B> And whatever shuttles are wanted, for the manufacture 
<A NAME="287"></A>of garments, thin or thick, of flaxen, woollen, or other material, ought 
<A NAME="288"></A>all of them to have the true form of the shuttle; and whatever is the shuttle 
<A NAME="289"></A>best adapted to each kind of work, that ought to be the form which the 
<A NAME="290"></A>maker produces in each case.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the same holds of other instruments: when a man 
<A NAME="293"></A>has discovered the instrument which is naturally adapted to each work, 
<A NAME="294"></A>he must express this natural form, and not others which he fancies, in 
<A NAME="295"></A>the material, whatever it may be, which he employs; for example, he ought 
<A NAME="296"></A>to know how to put into iron the forms of awls adapted by nature to their 
<A NAME="297"></A>several uses?
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And how to put into wood forms of shuttles adapted 
<A NAME="300"></A>by nature to their uses?
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> True.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> For the several forms of shuttles naturally answer 
<A NAME="303"></A>to the several kinds of webs; and this is true of instruments in 
<A NAME="304"></A>general.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, as to names: ought not our legislator also to 
<A NAME="307"></A>know how to put the true natural names of each thing into sounds and syllables 
<A NAME="308"></A>and to make and give all names with a view to the ideal name, if he is 
<A NAME="309"></A>to be a namer in any true sense? And we must remember that different legislators 
<A NAME="310"></A>will not use the same syllables. For neither does every smith, although 
<A NAME="311"></A>he may be making the same instrument for the same purpose, make them all 
<A NAME="312"></A>of the same iron. The form must be the same, but the material may vary, 
<A NAME="313"></A>and still the instrument may be equally good of whatever iron made, whether 
<A NAME="314"></A>in Hellas or in a foreign country;- there is no difference.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the legislator, whether he be Hellene or barbarian, 
<A NAME="317"></A>is not therefore to be deemed by you a worse legislator, provided he gives 
<A NAME="318"></A>the true and proper form of the name in whatever syllables; this or that 
<A NAME="319"></A>country makes no matter.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But who then is to determine whether the proper form 
<A NAME="322"></A>is given to the shuttle, whatever sort of wood may be used? the carpenter 
<A NAME="323"></A>who makes, or the weaver who is to use them?
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I should say, he who is to use them, 
<A NAME="325"></A>Socrates.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And who uses the work of the lyremaker? Will not he 
<A NAME="327"></A>be the man who knows how to direct what is being done, and who will know 
<A NAME="328"></A>also whether the work is being well done or not?
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And who is he?
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> The player of the lyre.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And who will direct the shipwright?
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> The pilot.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And who will be best able to direct the legislator 
<A NAME="335"></A>in his work, and will know whether the work is well done, in this or any 
<A NAME="336"></A>other country? Will not the user be the man?
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And this is he who knows how to ask 
<A NAME="339"></A>questions?
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And how to answer them?
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And him who knows how to ask and answer you would call 
<A NAME="344"></A>a dialectician?
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes; that would be his name.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then the work of the carpenter is to make a rudder, 
<A NAME="347"></A>and the pilot has to direct him, if the rudder is to be well 
<A NAME="348"></A>made.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> True.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And the work of the legislator is to give names, and 
<A NAME="351"></A>the dialectician must be his director if the names are to be rightly 
<A NAME="352"></A>given?
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> That is true.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then, Hermogenes, I should say that this giving of 
<A NAME="355"></A>names can be no such light matter as you fancy, or the work of light or 
<A NAME="356"></A>chance persons; and Cratylus is right in saying that things have names 
<A NAME="357"></A>by nature, and that not every man is an artificer of names, but he only 
<A NAME="358"></A>who looks to the name which each thing by nature has, and is able to express 
<A NAME="359"></A>the true forms of things in letters and syllables.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I cannot answer you, Socrates; but I find a difficulty 
<A NAME="361"></A>in changing my opinion all in a moment, and I think that I should be more 
<A NAME="362"></A>readily persuaded, if you would show me what this is which you term the 
<A NAME="363"></A>natural fitness of names.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> My good Hermogenes, I have none to show. Was I not 
<A NAME="365"></A>telling you just now (but you have forgotten), that I knew nothing, and 
<A NAME="366"></A>proposing to share the enquiry with you? But now that you and I have talked 
<A NAME="367"></A>over the matter, a step has been gained; for we have discovered that names 
<A NAME="368"></A>have by nature a truth, and that not every man knows how to give a thing 
<A NAME="369"></A>a name.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And what is the nature of this truth or correctness 
<A NAME="372"></A>of names? That, if you care to know, is the next question.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Certainly, I care to know.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then reflect.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> How shall I reflect?
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The true way is to have the assistance of those who 
<A NAME="377"></A>know, and you must pay them well both in money and in thanks; these are 
<A NAME="378"></A>the Sophists, of whom your brother, Callias, has- rather dearly- bought 
<A NAME="379"></A>the reputation of wisdom. But you have not yet come into your inheritance, 
<A NAME="380"></A>and therefore you had better go to him, and beg and entreat him to tell 
<A NAME="381"></A>you what he has learnt from Protagoras about the fitness of 
<A NAME="382"></A>names.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> But how inconsistent should I be, if, whilst repudiating 
<A NAME="384"></A>Protagoras and his Truth, I were to attach any value to what he and his 
<A NAME="385"></A>book affirm!
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then if you despise him, you must learn of Homer and 
<A NAME="387"></A>the poets.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> And where does Homer say anything about names, and 
<A NAME="389"></A>what does he say?
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> He often speaks of them; notably and nobly in the places 
<A NAME="391"></A>where he distinguishes the different names which Gods and men give to the 
<A NAME="392"></A>same things. Does he not in these passages make a remarkable statement 
<A NAME="393"></A>about the correctness of names? For the Gods must clearly be supposed to 
<A NAME="394"></A>call things by their right and natural names; do you not think 
<A NAME="395"></A>so?
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Why, of course they call them rightly, if they call 
<A NAME="397"></A>them at all. But to what are you referring?
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do you not know what he says about the river in Troy 
<A NAME="399"></A>who had a single combat with Hephaestus?
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>Whom the Gods call Xanthus, and men call Scamander.
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I remember.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, and about this river- to know that he ought to 
<A NAME="403"></A>be called Xanthus and not Scamander- is not that a solemn lesson? Or about 
<A NAME="404"></A>the bird which, as he says,
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>The Gods call Chalcis, and men Cymindis: to be taught how much 
<A NAME="406"></A>more correct the name Chalcis is than the name Cymindis- do you deem that 
<A NAME="407"></A>a light matter? Or about Batieia and Myrina? And there are many other observations 
<A NAME="408"></A>of the same kind in Homer and other poets. Now, I think that this is beyond 
<A NAME="409"></A>the understanding of you and me; but the names of Scamandrius and Astyanax, 
<A NAME="410"></A>which he affirms to have been the names of Hector's son, are more within 
<A NAME="411"></A>the range of human faculties, as I am disposed to think; and what the poet 
<A NAME="412"></A>means by correctness may be more readily apprehended in that instance: 
<A NAME="413"></A>you will remember I dare say the lines to which I refer?
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I do.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Let me ask you, then, which did Homer think the more 
<A NAME="416"></A>correct of the names given to Hector's son- Astyanax or 
<A NAME="417"></A>Scamandrius?
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I do not know.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> How would you answer, if you were asked whether the 
<A NAME="420"></A>wise or the unwise are more likely to give correct names?
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I should say the wise, of course.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And are the men or the women of a city, taken as a 
<A NAME="423"></A>class, the wiser?
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I should say, the men.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And Homer, as you know, says that the Trojan men called 
<A NAME="426"></A>him Astyanax (king of the city); but if the men called him Astyanax, the 
<A NAME="427"></A>other name of Scamandrius could only have been given to him by the 
<A NAME="428"></A>women.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> That may be inferred.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And must not Homer have imagined the Trojans to be 
<A NAME="431"></A>wiser than their wives?
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then he must have thought Astyanax to be a more correct 
<A NAME="434"></A>name for the boy than Scamandrius?
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Clearly.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And what is the reason of this? Let us consider:- does 
<A NAME="437"></A>he not himself suggest a very good reason, when he says,
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>For he alone defended their city and long walls? This appears to 
<A NAME="439"></A>be a good reason for calling the son of the saviour king of the city which 
<A NAME="440"></A>his father was saving, as Homer observes.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I see.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why, Hermogenes, I do not as yet see myself; and do 
<A NAME="443"></A>you?
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> No, indeed; not I.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But tell me, friend, did not Homer himself also give 
<A NAME="446"></A>Hector his name?
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> What of that?
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The name appears to me to be very nearly the same as 
<A NAME="449"></A>the name of Astyanax- both are Hellenic; and a king (anax) and a holder 
<A NAME="450"></A>(ektor) have nearly the same meaning, and are both descriptive of a king; 
<A NAME="451"></A>for a man is clearly the holder of that of which he is king; he rules, 
<A NAME="452"></A>and owns, and holds it. But, perhaps, you may think that I am talking nonsense; 
<A NAME="453"></A>and indeed I believe that I myself did not know what I meant when I imagined 
<A NAME="454"></A>that I had found some indication of the opinion of Homer about the correctness 
<A NAME="455"></A>of names.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I assure you that I think otherwise, and I believe 
<A NAME="457"></A>you to be on the right track.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> There is reason, I think, in calling the lion's whelp 
<A NAME="459"></A>a lion, and the foal of a horse a horse; I am speaking only of the ordinary 
<A NAME="460"></A>course of nature, when an animal produces after his kind, and not of extraordinary 
<A NAME="461"></A>births;- if contrary to nature a horse have a calf, then I should not call 
<A NAME="462"></A>that a foal but a calf; nor do I call any inhuman birth a man, but only 
<A NAME="463"></A>a natural birth. And the same may be said of trees and other things. Do 
<A NAME="464"></A>you agree with me?
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes, I agree.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Very good. But you had better watch me and see that 
<A NAME="467"></A>I do not play tricks with you. For on the same principle the son of a king 
<A NAME="468"></A>is to be called a king. And whether the syllables of the name are the same 
<A NAME="469"></A>or not the same, makes no difference, provided the meaning is retained; 
<A NAME="470"></A>nor does the addition or subtraction of a letter make any difference so 
<A NAME="471"></A>long as the essence of the thing remains in possession of the name and 
<A NAME="472"></A>appears in it.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> A very simple matter. I may illustrate my meaning by 
<A NAME="475"></A>the names of letters, which you know are not the same as the letters themselves 
<A NAME="476"></A>with the exception of the four e, u, o (short), o (long); the names of 
<A NAME="477"></A>the rest, whether vowels or consonants, are made up of other letters which 
<A NAME="478"></A>we add to them; but so long as we introduce the meaning, and there can 
<A NAME="479"></A>be no mistake, the name of the letter is quite correct. Take, for example, 
<A NAME="480"></A>the letter beta- the addition of e, t, a, gives no offence, and does not 
<A NAME="481"></A>prevent the whole name from having the value which the legislator intended- 
<A NAME="482"></A>so well did he know how to give the letters names.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I believe you are right.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And may not the same be said of a king? a king will 
<A NAME="485"></A>often be the son of a king, the good son or the noble son of a good or 
<A NAME="486"></A>noble sire; and similarly the off spring of every kind, in the regular 
<A NAME="487"></A>course of nature, is like the parent, and therefore has the same name. 
<A NAME="488"></A>Yet the syllables may be disguised until they appear different to the ignorant 
<A NAME="489"></A>person, and he may not recognize them, although they are the same, just 
<A NAME="490"></A>as any one of us would not recognize the same drugs under different disguises 
<A NAME="491"></A>of colour and smell, although to the physician, who regards the power of 
<A NAME="492"></A>them, they are the same, and he is not put out by the addition; and in 
<A NAME="493"></A>like manner the etymologist is not put out by the addition or transposition 
<A NAME="494"></A>or subtraction of a letter or two, or indeed by the change of all the letters, 
<A NAME="495"></A>for this need not interfere with the meaning. As was just now said, the 
<A NAME="496"></A>names of Hector and Astyanax have only one letter alike, which is t, and 
<A NAME="497"></A>yet they have the same meaning. And how little in common with the letters 
<A NAME="498"></A>of their names has Archepolis (ruler of the city)- and yet the meaning 
<A NAME="499"></A>is the same. And there are many other names which just mean "king." Again, 
<A NAME="500"></A>there are several names for a general, as, for example, Agis (leader) and 
<A NAME="501"></A>Polemarchus (chief in war) and Eupolemus (good warrior); and others which 
<A NAME="502"></A>denote a physician, as Iatrocles (famous healer) and Acesimbrotus (curer 
<A NAME="503"></A>of mortals); and there are many others which might be cited, differing 
<A NAME="504"></A>in their syllables and letters, but having the same meaning. Would you 
<A NAME="505"></A>not say so?
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The same names, then, ought to be assigned to those 
<A NAME="508"></A>who follow in the course of nature?
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And what of those who follow out of the course of nature, 
<A NAME="511"></A>and are prodigies? for example, when a good and religious man has an irreligious 
<A NAME="512"></A>son, he ought to bear the name not of his father, but of the class to which 
<A NAME="513"></A>he belongs, just as in the case which was before supposed of a horse foaling 
<A NAME="514"></A>a calf.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Quite true.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then the irreligious son of a religious father should 
<A NAME="517"></A>be called irreligious?
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> He should not be called Theophilus (beloved of God) 
<A NAME="520"></A>or Mnesitheus (mindful of God), or any of these names: if names are correctly 
<A NAME="521"></A>given, his should have an opposite meaning.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Certainly, Socrates.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Again, Hermogenes, there is Orestes (the man of the 
<A NAME="524"></A>mountains) who appears to be rightly called; whether chance gave the name, 
<A NAME="525"></A>or perhaps some poet who meant to express the brutality and fierceness 
<A NAME="526"></A>and mountain wildness of his hero's nature.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> That is very likely, Socrates.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And his father's name is also according to 
<A NAME="529"></A>nature.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Clearly.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, for as his name, so also is his nature; Agamemnon 
<A NAME="532"></A>(admirable for remaining) is one who is patient and persevering in the 
<A NAME="533"></A>accomplishment of his resolves, and by his virtue crowns them; and his 
<A NAME="534"></A>continuance at Troy with all the vast army is a proof of that admirable 
<A NAME="535"></A>endurance in him which is signified by the name Agamemnon. I also think 
<A NAME="536"></A>that Atreus is rightly called; for his murder of Chrysippus and his exceeding 
<A NAME="537"></A>cruelty to Thyestes are damaging and destructive to his reputation- the 
<A NAME="538"></A>name is a little altered and disguised so as not to be intelligible to 
<A NAME="539"></A>every one, but to the etymologist there is no difficulty in seeing the 
<A NAME="540"></A>meaning, for whether you think of him as ateires the stubborn, or as atrestos 
<A NAME="541"></A>the fearless, or as ateros the destructive one, the name is perfectly correct 
<A NAME="542"></A>in every point of view. And I think that Pelops is also named appropriately; 
<A NAME="543"></A>for, as the name implies, he is rightly called Pelops who sees what is 
<A NAME="544"></A>near only (o ta pelas oron).
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> How so?
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Because, according to the tradition, he had no forethought 
<A NAME="547"></A>or foresight of all the evil which the murder of Myrtilus would entail 
<A NAME="548"></A>upon his whole race in remote ages; he saw only what was at hand and immediate,- 
<A NAME="549"></A>Or in other words, pelas (near), in his eagerness to win Hippodamia by 
<A NAME="550"></A>all means for his bride. Every one would agree that the name of Tantalus 
<A NAME="551"></A>is rightly given and in accordance with nature, if the traditions about 
<A NAME="552"></A>him are true.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> And what are the traditions?
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Many terrible misfortunes are said to have happened 
<A NAME="555"></A>to him in his life- last of all, came the utter ruin of his country; and 
<A NAME="556"></A>after his death he had the stone suspended (talanteia) over his head in 
<A NAME="557"></A>the world below- all this agrees wonderfully well with his name. You might 
<A NAME="558"></A>imagine that some person who wanted to call him Talantatos (the most weighted 
<A NAME="559"></A>down by misfortune), disguised the name by altering it into Tantalus; and 
<A NAME="560"></A>into this form, by some accident of tradition, it has actually been transmuted. 
<A NAME="561"></A>The name of Zeus, who is his alleged father, has also an excellent meaning, 
<A NAME="562"></A>although hard to be understood, because really like a sentence, which is 
<A NAME="563"></A>divided into two parts, for some call him Zena, and use the one half, and 
<A NAME="564"></A>others who use the other half call him Dia; the two together signify the 
<A NAME="565"></A>nature of the God, and the business of a name, as we were saying, is to 
<A NAME="566"></A>express the nature. For there is none who is more the author of life to 
<A NAME="567"></A>us and to all, than the lord and king of all. Wherefore we are right in 
<A NAME="568"></A>calling him Zena and Dia, which are one name, although divided, meaning 
<A NAME="569"></A>the God through whom all creatures always have life (di on zen aei pasi 
<A NAME="570"></A>tois zosin uparchei). There is an irreverence, at first sight, in calling 
<A NAME="571"></A>him son of Cronos (who is a proverb for stupidity), and we might rather 
<A NAME="572"></A>expect Zeus to be the child of a mighty intellect. Which is the fact; for 
<A NAME="573"></A>this is the meaning of his father's name: Kronos quasi Koros (Choreo, to 
<A NAME="574"></A>sweep), not in the sense of a youth, but signifying to chatharon chai acheraton 
<A NAME="575"></A>tou nou, the pure and garnished mind (sc. apo tou chorein). He, as we are 
<A NAME="576"></A>informed by tradition, was begotten of Uranus, rightly so called (apo tou 
<A NAME="577"></A>oran ta ano) from looking upwards; which, as philosophers tell us, is the 
<A NAME="578"></A>way to have a pure mind, and the name Uranus is therefore correct. If I 
<A NAME="579"></A>could remember the genealogy of Hesiod, I would have gone on and tried 
<A NAME="580"></A>more conclusions of the same sort on the remoter ancestors of the Gods,- 
<A NAME="581"></A>then I might have seen whether this wisdom, which has come to me all in 
<A NAME="582"></A>an instant, I know not whence, will or will not hold good to the 
<A NAME="583"></A>end.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> You seem to me, Socrates, to be quite like a prophet 
<A NAME="585"></A>newly inspired, and to be uttering oracles.
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, Hermogenes, and I believe that I caught the inspiration 
<A NAME="587"></A>from the great Euthyphro of the Prospaltian deme, who gave me a long lecture 
<A NAME="588"></A>which commenced at dawn: he talked and I listened, and his wisdom and enchanting 
<A NAME="589"></A>ravishment has not only filled my ears but taken possession of my soul,and 
<A NAME="590"></A>to-day I shall let his superhuman power work and finish the investigation 
<A NAME="591"></A>of names- that will be the way; but to-morrow, if you are so disposed, 
<A NAME="592"></A>we will conjure him away, and make a purgation of him, if we can only find 
<A NAME="593"></A>some priest or sophist who is skilled in purifications of this 
<A NAME="594"></A>sort.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> With all my heart; for am very curious to hear the 
<A NAME="596"></A>rest of the enquiry about names.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then let us proceed; and where would you have us begin, 
<A NAME="598"></A>now that we have got a sort of outline of the enquiry? Are there any names 
<A NAME="599"></A>which witness of themselves that they are not given arbitrarily, but have 
<A NAME="600"></A>a natural fitness? The names of heroes and of men in general are apt to 
<A NAME="601"></A>be deceptive because they are often called after ancestors with whose names, 
<A NAME="602"></A>as we were saying, they may have no business; or they are the expression 
<A NAME="603"></A>of a wish like Eutychides (the son of good fortune), or Sosias (the Saviour), 
<A NAME="604"></A>or Theophilus (the beloved of God), and others. But I think that we had 
<A NAME="605"></A>better leave these, for there will be more chance of finding correctness 
<A NAME="606"></A>in the names of immutable essences;- there ought to have been more care 
<A NAME="607"></A>taken about them when they were named, and perhaps there may have been 
<A NAME="608"></A>some more than human power at work occasionally in giving them 
<A NAME="609"></A>names.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I think so, Socrates.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Ought we not to begin with the consideration of the 
<A NAME="612"></A>Gods, and show that they are" rightly named Gods?
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes, that will be well.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> My notion would be something of this sort:- I suspect 
<A NAME="615"></A>that the sun, moon, earth, stars, and heaven, which are still the Gods 
<A NAME="616"></A>of many barbarians, were the only Gods known to the aboriginal Hellenes. 
<A NAME="617"></A>Seeing that they were always moving and running, from their running nature 
<A NAME="618"></A>they were called Gods or runners (Theous, Theontas); and when men became 
<A NAME="619"></A>acquainted with the other Gods, they proceeded to apply the same name to 
<A NAME="620"></A>them all. Do you think that likely?
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I think it very likely indeed.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What shall follow the Gods?
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Must not demons and heroes and men come 
<A NAME="624"></A>next?
<A NAME="625"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Demons! And what do you consider to be the meaning 
<A NAME="626"></A>of this word? Tell me if my view is right.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Let me hear.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You know how Hesiod uses the word?
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I do not.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do you not remember that he speaks of a golden race 
<A NAME="631"></A>of men who came first?
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes, I do.
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> He says of them-
<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR>But now that fate has closed over this race
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>They are holy demons upon the earth,
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Beneficent, averters of ills, guardians of mortal 
<A NAME="637"></A>men.
<A NAME="638"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> What is the inference?
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What is the inference! Why, I suppose that he means 
<A NAME="640"></A>by the golden men, not men literally made of gold, but good and noble; 
<A NAME="641"></A>and I am convinced of this, because he further says that we are the iron 
<A NAME="642"></A>race.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> That is true.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And do you not suppose that good men of our own day 
<A NAME="645"></A>would by him be said to be of golden race?
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Very likely.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And are not the good wise?
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes, they are wise.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And therefore I have the most entire conviction that 
<A NAME="650"></A>he called them demons, because they were daemones (knowing or wise), and 
<A NAME="651"></A>in our older Attic dialect the word itself occurs. Now he and other poets 
<A NAME="652"></A>say truly, that when a good man dies he has honour and a mighty portion 
<A NAME="653"></A>among the dead, and becomes a demon; which is a name given to him signifying 
<A NAME="654"></A>wisdom. And I say too, that every wise man who happens to be a good man 
<A NAME="655"></A>is more than human (daimonion) both in life and death, and is rightly called 
<A NAME="656"></A>a demon.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Then I rather think that I am of one mind with you; 
<A NAME="658"></A>but what is the meaning of the word "hero"? (eros)
<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I think that there is no difficulty in explaining, 
<A NAME="660"></A>for the name is not much altered, and signifies that they were born of 
<A NAME="661"></A>love.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="663"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Do you not know that the heroes are 
<A NAME="664"></A>demigods?
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> What then?
<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> All of them sprang either from the love of a God for 
<A NAME="667"></A>a mortal woman, or of a mortal man for a Goddess; think of the word in 
<A NAME="668"></A>the old Attic, and you will see better that the name heros is only a slight 
<A NAME="669"></A>alteration of Eros, from whom the heroes sprang: either this is the meaning, 
<A NAME="670"></A>or, if not this, then they must have been skilful as rhetoricians and dialecticians, 
<A NAME="671"></A>and able to put the question (erotan), for eirein is equivalent to legein. 
<A NAME="672"></A>And therefore, as I was saying, in the Attic dialect the heroes turn out 
<A NAME="673"></A>to be rhetoricians and questioners. All this is easy enough; the noble 
<A NAME="674"></A>breed of heroes are a tribe of sophists and rhetors. But can you tell me 
<A NAME="675"></A>why men are called anthropoi?- that is more difficult.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> No, I cannot; and I would not try even if I could, 
<A NAME="677"></A>because I think that you are the more likely to succeed.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That is to say, you trust to the inspiration of 
<A NAME="679"></A>Euthyphro.
<A NAME="680"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Your faith is not vain; for at this very moment a new 
<A NAME="682"></A>and ingenious thought strikes me, and, if I am not careful, before tomorrow's 
<A NAME="683"></A>dawn I shall be wiser than I ought to be. Now, attend to me; and first, 
<A NAME="684"></A>remember that we of put in and pull out letters in words, and give names 
<A NAME="685"></A>as we please and change the accents. Take, for example, the word Dii Philos; 
<A NAME="686"></A>in order to convert this from a sentence into a noun, we omit one of the 
<A NAME="687"></A>iotas and sound the middle syllable grave instead of acute; as, on the 
<A NAME="688"></A>other hand, letters are sometimes inserted in words instead of being omitted, 
<A NAME="689"></A>and the acute takes the place of the grave.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> That is true.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The name anthropos, which was once a sentence, and 
<A NAME="692"></A>is now a noun, appears to be a case just of this sort, for one letter, 
<A NAME="693"></A>which is the a, has been omitted, and the acute on the last syllable has 
<A NAME="694"></A>been changed to a grave.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> What do you mean?
<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I mean to say that the word "man" implies that other 
<A NAME="697"></A>animals never examine, or consider, or look up at what they see, but that 
<A NAME="698"></A>man not only sees (opope) but considers and looks up at that which he sees, 
<A NAME="699"></A>and hence he alone of all animals is rightly anthropos, meaning anathron 
<A NAME="700"></A>a opopen.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> May I ask you to examine another word about which I 
<A NAME="702"></A>am curious?
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I will take that which appears to me to follow next 
<A NAME="705"></A>in order. You know the distinction of soul and body?
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Of course.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Let us endeavour to analyze them like the previous 
<A NAME="708"></A>words.
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You want me first of all to examine the natural fitness 
<A NAME="710"></A>of the word psnche (soul), and then of the word soma 
<A NAME="711"></A>(body)?
<A NAME="712"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> If I am to say what occurs to me at the moment, I should 
<A NAME="714"></A>imagine that those who first use the name psnche meant to express that 
<A NAME="715"></A>the soul when in the body is the source of life, and gives the power of 
<A NAME="716"></A>breath and revival (anapsuchon), and when this reviving power fails then 
<A NAME="717"></A>the body perishes and dies, and this, if I am not mistaken, they called 
<A NAME="718"></A>psyche. But please stay a moment; I fancy that I can discover something 
<A NAME="719"></A>which will be more acceptable to the disciples of Euthyphro, for I am afraid 
<A NAME="720"></A>that they will scorn this explanation. What do you say to 
<A NAME="721"></A>another?
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Let me hear.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What is that which holds and carries and gives life 
<A NAME="724"></A>and motion to the entire nature of the body? What else but the 
<A NAME="725"></A>soul?
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Just that.
<A NAME="727"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And do you not believe with Anaxagoras, that mind or 
<A NAME="728"></A>soul is the ordering and containing principle of all 
<A NAME="729"></A>things?
<A NAME="730"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes; I do.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then you may well call that power phuseche which carries 
<A NAME="732"></A>and holds nature (e phusin okei, kai ekei), and this may be refined away 
<A NAME="733"></A>into psuche. Her. Certainly; and this derivation is, I think, more scientific 
<A NAME="734"></A>than the other.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> It is so; but I cannot help laughing, if I am to suppose 
<A NAME="736"></A>that this was the true meaning of the name.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> But what shall we say of the next 
<A NAME="738"></A>word?
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You mean soma (the body).
<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That may be variously interpreted; and yet more variously 
<A NAME="742"></A>if a little permutation is allowed. For some say that the body is the grave 
<A NAME="743"></A>(sema) of the soul which may be thought to be buried in our present life; 
<A NAME="744"></A>or again the index of the soul, because the soul gives indications to (semainei) 
<A NAME="745"></A>the body; probably the Orphic poets were the inventors of the name, and 
<A NAME="746"></A>they were under the impression that the soul is suffering the punishment 
<A NAME="747"></A>of sin, and that the body is an enclosure or prison in which the soul is 
<A NAME="748"></A>incarcerated, kept safe (soma, sozetai), as the name ooma implies, until 
<A NAME="749"></A>the penalty is paid; according to this view, not even a letter of the word 
<A NAME="750"></A>need be changed.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I think, Socrates, that we have said enough of this 
<A NAME="752"></A>class of words. But have we any more explanations of the names of the Gods, 
<A NAME="753"></A>like that which you were giving of Zeus? I should like to know whether 
<A NAME="754"></A>any similar principle of correctness is to be applied to 
<A NAME="755"></A>them.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, indeed, Hermogenes; and there is one excellent 
<A NAME="757"></A>principle which, as men of sense, we must acknowledge,- that of the Gods 
<A NAME="758"></A>we know nothing, either of their natures or of the names which they give 
<A NAME="759"></A>themselves; but we are sure that the names by which they call themselves, 
<A NAME="760"></A>whatever they may be, are true. And this is the best of all principles; 
<A NAME="761"></A>and the next best is to say, as in prayers, that we will call them by any 
<A NAME="762"></A>sort of kind names or patronymics which they like, because we do not know 
<A NAME="763"></A>of any other. That also, I think, is a very good custom, and one which 
<A NAME="764"></A>I should much wish to observe. Let us, then, if you please, in the first 
<A NAME="765"></A>place announce to them that we are not enquiring about them; we do not 
<A NAME="766"></A>presume that we are able to do so; but we are enquiring about the meaning 
<A NAME="767"></A>of men in giving them these names,- in this there can be small 
<A NAME="768"></A>blame.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I think, Socrates, that you are quite right, and I 
<A NAME="770"></A>would like to do as you say.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Shall we begin, then, with Hestia, according to 
<A NAME="772"></A>custom?
<A NAME="773"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes, that will be very proper.
<A NAME="774"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What may we suppose him to have meant who gave the 
<A NAME="775"></A>name Hestia?
<A NAME="776"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> That is another and certainly a most difficult 
<A NAME="777"></A>question.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> My dear Hermogenes, the first imposers of names must 
<A NAME="779"></A>surely have been considerable persons; they were philosophers, and had 
<A NAME="780"></A>a good deal to say.
<A NAME="781"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Well, and what of them?
<A NAME="782"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> They are the men to whom I should attribute the imposition 
<A NAME="783"></A>of names. Even in foreign names, if you analyze them, a meaning is still 
<A NAME="784"></A>discernible. For example, that which we term ousia is by some called esia, 
<A NAME="785"></A>and by others again osia. Now that the essence of things should be called 
<A NAME="786"></A>estia, which is akin to the first of these (esia = estia), is rational 
<A NAME="787"></A>enough. And there is reason in the Athenians calling that estia which participates 
<A NAME="788"></A>in ousia. For in ancient times we too seem to have said esia for ousia, 
<A NAME="789"></A>and this you may note to have been the idea of those who appointed that 
<A NAME="790"></A>sacrifices should be first offered to estia, which was natural enough if 
<A NAME="791"></A>they meant that estia was the essence of things. Those again who read osia 
<A NAME="792"></A>seem to have inclined to the opinion of Heracleitus, that all things flow 
<A NAME="793"></A>and nothing stands; with them the pushing principle (othoun) is the cause 
<A NAME="794"></A>and ruling power of all things, and is therefore rightly called osia. Enough 
<A NAME="795"></A>of this, which is all that we who know nothing can affirm. Next in order 
<A NAME="796"></A>after Hestia we ought to consider Rhea and Cronos, although the name of 
<A NAME="797"></A>Cronos has been already discussed. But I dare say that I am talking great 
<A NAME="798"></A>nonsense.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Why, Socrates?
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> My good friend, I have discovered a hive of 
<A NAME="801"></A>wisdom.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Of what nature?
<A NAME="803"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, rather ridiculous, and yet 
<A NAME="804"></A>plausible.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> How plausible?
<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I fancy to myself Heracleitus repeating wise traditions 
<A NAME="807"></A>of antiquity as old as the days of Cronos and Rhea, and of which Homer 
<A NAME="808"></A>also spoke.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> How do you mean?
<A NAME="810"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Heracleitus is supposed to say that all things are 
<A NAME="811"></A>in motion and nothing at rest; he compares them to the stream of a river, 
<A NAME="812"></A>and says that you cannot go into the same water twice.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> That is true.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, then, how can we avoid inferring that he who 
<A NAME="815"></A>gave the names of Cronos and Rhea to the ancestors of the Gods, agreed 
<A NAME="816"></A>pretty much in the doctrine of Heracleitus? Is the giving of the names 
<A NAME="817"></A>of streams to both of them purely accidental? Compare the line in which 
<A NAME="818"></A>Homer, and, as I believe, Hesiod also, tells of
<A NAME="819"></A><BR><BR>Ocean, the origin of Gods, and mother Tethys. And again, Orpheus 
<A NAME="820"></A>says, that
<A NAME="821"></A><BR><BR>The fair river of Ocean was the first to marry, and he espoused 
<A NAME="822"></A>his sister Tethys, who was his mother's daughter. You see that this is 
<A NAME="823"></A>a remarkable coincidence, and all in the direction of 
<A NAME="824"></A>Heracleitus.
<A NAME="825"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I think that there is something in what you say, Socrates; 
<A NAME="826"></A>but I do not understand the meaning of the name Tethys.
<A NAME="827"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well, that is almost self-explained, being only the 
<A NAME="828"></A>name of a spring, a little disguised; for that which is strained and filtered 
<A NAME="829"></A>(diattomenon, ethoumenon) may be likened to a spring, and the name Tethys 
<A NAME="830"></A>is made up of these two words.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> The idea is ingenious, Socrates.
<A NAME="832"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> To be sure. But what comes next?- of Zeus we have 
<A NAME="833"></A>spoken.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then let us next take his two brothers, Poseidon and 
<A NAME="836"></A>Pluto, whether the latter is called by that or by his other 
<A NAME="837"></A>name.
<A NAME="838"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> By all means.
<A NAME="839"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Poseidon is Posidesmos, the chain of the feet; the 
<A NAME="840"></A>original inventor of the name had been stopped by the watery element in 
<A NAME="841"></A>his walks, and not allowed to go on, and therefore he called the ruler 
<A NAME="842"></A>of this element Poseidon; the e was probably inserted as an ornament. Yet, 
<A NAME="843"></A>perhaps, not so; but the name may have been originally written with a double 
<A NAME="844"></A>l and not with an s, meaning that the God knew many things (Polla eidos). 
<A NAME="845"></A>And perhaps also he being the shaker of the earth, has been named from 
<A NAME="846"></A>shaking (seiein), and then p and d have been added. Pluto gives wealth 
<A NAME="847"></A>(Ploutos), and his name means the giver of wealth, which comes out of the 
<A NAME="848"></A>earth beneath. People in general appear to imagine that the term Hades 
<A NAME="849"></A>is connected with the invisible (aeides) and so they are led by their fears 
<A NAME="850"></A>to call the God Pluto instead.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> And what is the true derivation?
<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> In spite of the mistakes which are made about the power 
<A NAME="853"></A>of this deity, and the foolish fears which people have of him, such as 
<A NAME="854"></A>the fear of always being with him after death, and of the soul denuded 
<A NAME="855"></A>of the body going to him, my belief is that all is quite consistent, and 
<A NAME="856"></A>that the office and name of the God really correspond.
<A NAME="857"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Why, how is that?
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I will tell you my own opinion; but first, I should 
<A NAME="859"></A>like to ask you which chain does any animal feel to be the stronger? and 
<A NAME="860"></A>which confines him more to the same spot,- desire or 
<A NAME="861"></A>necessity?
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Desire, Socrates, is stronger far.
<A NAME="863"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And do you not think that many a one would escape from 
<A NAME="864"></A>Hades, if he did not bind those who depart to him by the strongest of 
<A NAME="865"></A>chains?
<A NAME="866"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Assuredly they would.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And if by the greatest of chains, then by some desire, 
<A NAME="868"></A>as I should certainly infer, and not by necessity?
<A NAME="869"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> That is clear.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And there are many desires?
<A NAME="871"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="872"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And therefore by the greatest desire, if the chain 
<A NAME="873"></A>is to be the greatest?
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is any desire stronger than the thought that you 
<A NAME="876"></A>will be made better by associating with another?
<A NAME="877"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Certainly not.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is not that the reason, Hermogenes, why no one, 
<A NAME="879"></A>who has been to him, is willing to come back to us? Even the Sirens, like 
<A NAME="880"></A>all the rest of the world, have been laid under his spells. Such a charm, 
<A NAME="881"></A>as I imagine, is the God able to infuse into his words. And, according 
<A NAME="882"></A>to this view, he is the perfect and accomplished Sophist, and the great 
<A NAME="883"></A>benefactor of the inhabitants of the other world; and even to us who are 
<A NAME="884"></A>upon earth he sends from below exceeding blessings. For he has much more 
<A NAME="885"></A>than he wants down there; wherefore he is called Pluto (or the rich). Note 
<A NAME="886"></A>also, that he will have nothing to do with men while they are in the body, 
<A NAME="887"></A>but only when the soul is liberated from the desires and evils of the body. 
<A NAME="888"></A>Now there is a great deal of philosophy and reflection in that; for in 
<A NAME="889"></A>their liberated state he can bind them with the desire of virtue, but while 
<A NAME="890"></A>they are flustered and maddened by the body, not even father Cronos himself 
<A NAME="891"></A>would suffice to keep them with him in his own far-famed 
<A NAME="892"></A>chains.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> There is a deal of truth in what you 
<A NAME="894"></A>say.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Yes, Hermogenes, and the legislator called him Hades, 
<A NAME="896"></A>not from the unseen (aeides)- far otherwise, but from his knowledge (eidenai) 
<A NAME="897"></A>of all noble things.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Very good; and what do we say of Demeter, and Here, 
<A NAME="899"></A>and Apollo, and Athene, and Hephaestus, and Ares, and the other 
<A NAME="900"></A>deities?
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Demeter is e didousa meter, who gives food like a mother; 
<A NAME="902"></A>Here is the lovely one (erate)- for Zeus, according to tradition, loved 
<A NAME="903"></A>and married her; possibly also the name may have been given when the legislator 
<A NAME="904"></A>was thinking of the heavens, and may be only a disguise of the air (aer), 
<A NAME="905"></A>putting the end in the place of the beginning. You will recognize the truth 
<A NAME="906"></A>of this if you repeat the letters of Here several times over. People dread 
<A NAME="907"></A>the name of Pherephatta as they dread the name of Apollo- and with as little 
<A NAME="908"></A>reason; the fear, if I am not mistaken, only arises from their ignorance 
<A NAME="909"></A>of the nature of names. But they go changing the name into Phersephone, 
<A NAME="910"></A>and they are terrified at this; whereas the new name means only that the 
<A NAME="911"></A>Goddess is wise (sophe); for seeing that all things in the world are in 
<A NAME="912"></A>motion (pheromenon), that principle which embraces and touches and is able 
<A NAME="913"></A>to follow them, is wisdom. And therefore the Goddess may be truly called 
<A NAME="914"></A>Pherepaphe (Pherepapha), or some name like it, because she touches that 
<A NAME="915"></A>which is (tou pheromenon ephaptomene), herein showing her wisdom. And Hades, 
<A NAME="916"></A>who is wise, consorts with her, because she is wise. They alter her name 
<A NAME="917"></A>into Pherephatta now-a-days, because the present generation care for euphony 
<A NAME="918"></A>more than truth. There is the other name, Apollo, which, as I was saying, 
<A NAME="919"></A>is generally supposed to have some terrible signification. Have you remarked 
<A NAME="920"></A>this fact?
<A NAME="921"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> To be sure I have, and what you say is 
<A NAME="922"></A>true.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But the name, in my opinion, is really most expressive 
<A NAME="924"></A>of the power of the God.
<A NAME="925"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> How so?
<A NAME="926"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I will endeavour to explain, for I do not believe that 
<A NAME="927"></A>any single name could have been better adapted to express the attributes 
<A NAME="928"></A>of the God, embracing and in a manner signifying all four of them,- music, 
<A NAME="929"></A>and prophecy, and medicine, and archery.
<A NAME="930"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> That must be a strange name, and I should like to hear 
<A NAME="931"></A>the explanation.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Say rather an harmonious name, as beseems the God of 
<A NAME="933"></A>Harmony. In the first place, the purgations and purifications which doctors 
<A NAME="934"></A>and diviners use, and their fumigations with drugs magical or medicinal, 
<A NAME="935"></A>as well as their washings and lustral sprinklings, have all one and the 
<A NAME="936"></A>same object, which is to make a man pure both in body and 
<A NAME="937"></A>soul.
<A NAME="938"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And is not Apollo the purifier, and the washer, and 
<A NAME="940"></A>the absolver from all impurities?
<A NAME="941"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then in reference to his ablutions and absolutions, 
<A NAME="943"></A>as being the physician who orders them, he may be rightly called Apolouon 
<A NAME="944"></A>(purifier); or in respect of his powers of divination, and his truth and 
<A NAME="945"></A>sincerity, which is the same as truth, he may be most fitly called Aplos, 
<A NAME="946"></A>from aplous (sincere), as in the Thessalian dialect, for all the Thessalians 
<A NAME="947"></A>call him Aplos; also he is Ballon (always shooting), because he is a master 
<A NAME="948"></A>archer who never misses; or again, the name may refer to his musical attributes, 
<A NAME="949"></A>and then, as in akolouthos, and akoitis, and in many other words the a 
<A NAME="950"></A>is supposed to mean "together," so the meaning of the name Apollo will 
<A NAME="951"></A>be "moving together," whether in the poles of heaven as they are called, 
<A NAME="952"></A>or in the harmony of song, which is termed concord, because he moves all 
<A NAME="953"></A>together by an harmonious power, as astronomers and musicians ingeniously 
<A NAME="954"></A>declare. And he is the God who presides over harmony, and makes all things 
<A NAME="955"></A>move together, both among Gods and among men. And as in the words akolouthos 
<A NAME="956"></A>and akoitis the a is substituted for an o, so the name Apollon is equivalent 
<A NAME="957"></A>to omopolon; only the second l is added in order to avoid the ill-omened 
<A NAME="958"></A>sound of destruction (apolon). Now the suspicion of this destructive power 
<A NAME="959"></A>still haunts the minds of some who do not consider the true value of the 
<A NAME="960"></A>name, which, as I was saying just now, has reference to all the powers 
<A NAME="961"></A>of the God, who is the single one, the everdarting, the purifier, the mover 
<A NAME="962"></A>together (aplous, aei Ballon, apolouon, omopolon). The name of the Muses 
<A NAME="963"></A>and of music would seem to be derived from their making philosophical enquiries 
<A NAME="964"></A>(mosthai); and Leto is called by this name, because she is such a gentle 
<A NAME="965"></A>Goddess, and so willing (ethelemon) to grant our requests; or her name 
<A NAME="966"></A>may be Letho, as she is often called by strangers- they seem to imply by 
<A NAME="967"></A>it her amiability, and her smooth and easy-going way of behaving. Artemis 
<A NAME="968"></A>is named from her healthy (artemes), well-ordered nature, and because of 
<A NAME="969"></A>her love of virginity, perhaps because she is a proficient in virtue (arete), 
<A NAME="970"></A>and perhaps also as hating intercourse of the sexes (ton aroton miseasa). 
<A NAME="971"></A>He who gave the Goddess her name may have had any or all of these 
<A NAME="972"></A>reasons.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> What is the meaning of Dionysus and 
<A NAME="974"></A>Aphrodite?
<A NAME="975"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Son of Hipponicus, you ask a solemn question; there 
<A NAME="976"></A>is a serious and also a facetious explanation of both these names; the 
<A NAME="977"></A>serious explanation is not to be had from me, but there is no objection 
<A NAME="978"></A>to your hearing the facetious one; for the Gods too love a joke. Dionusos 
<A NAME="979"></A>is simply didous oinon (giver of wine), as he might be called in fun,- 
<A NAME="980"></A>and oinos is properly oionous, because wine makes those who drink, think 
<A NAME="981"></A>(oiesthai) that they have a mind (noun) when they have none. The derivation 
<A NAME="982"></A>of Aphrodite, born of the foam (aphoros), may be fairly accepted on the 
<A NAME="983"></A>authority of Hesiod.
<A NAME="984"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Still there remains Athene, whom you, Socrates, as 
<A NAME="985"></A>an Athenian, will surely not forget; there are also Hephaestus and 
<A NAME="986"></A>Ares.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I am not likely to forget them.
<A NAME="988"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> No, indeed.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> There is no difficulty in explaining the other appellation 
<A NAME="990"></A>of Athene.
<A NAME="991"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> What other appellation?
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> We call her Pallas.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> To be sure.
<A NAME="994"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And we cannot be wrong in supposing that this is derived 
<A NAME="995"></A>from armed dances. For the elevation of oneself or anything else above 
<A NAME="996"></A>the earth, or by the use of the hands, we call shaking (pallein), or 
<A NAME="997"></A>dancing.
<A NAME="998"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> That is quite true.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then that is the explanation of the name 
<A NAME="1000"></A>Pallas?
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes; but what do you say of the other 
<A NAME="1002"></A>name?
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Athene?
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That is a graver matter, and there, my friend, the 
<A NAME="1006"></A>modern interpreters of Homer may, I think, assist in explaining the view 
<A NAME="1007"></A>of the ancients. For most of these in their explanations of the poet, assert 
<A NAME="1008"></A>that he meant by Athene "mind" (nous) and "intelligence" (dianoia), and 
<A NAME="1009"></A>the maker of names appears to have had a singular notion about her; and 
<A NAME="1010"></A>indeed calls her by a still higher title, "divine intelligence" (Thou noesis), 
<A NAME="1011"></A>as though he would say: This is she who has the mind of God (Theonoa);- 
<A NAME="1012"></A>using a as a dialectical variety e, and taking away i and s. Perhaps, however, 
<A NAME="1013"></A>the name Theonoe may mean "she who knows divine things" (Theia noousa) 
<A NAME="1014"></A>better than others. Nor shall we be far wrong in supposing that the author 
<A NAME="1015"></A>of it wished to identify this Goddess with moral intelligence (en ethei 
<A NAME="1016"></A>noesin), and therefore gave her the name ethonoe; which, however, either 
<A NAME="1017"></A>he or his successors have altered into what they thought a nicer form, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>and called her Athene.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> But what do you say of Hephaestus?
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Speak you of the princely lord of light (Phaeos 
<A NAME="1021"></A>istora)?
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Surely.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Ephaistos is Phaistos, and has added the e by attraction; 
<A NAME="1024"></A>that is obvious to anybody.
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> That is very probable, until some more probable notion 
<A NAME="1026"></A>gets into your head.
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> To prevent that, you had better ask what is the derivation 
<A NAME="1028"></A>of Ares.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> What is Ares?
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Ares may be called, if you will, from his manhood (arren) 
<A NAME="1031"></A>and manliness, or if you please, from his hard and unchangeable nature, 
<A NAME="1032"></A>which is the meaning of arratos: the latter is a derivation in every way 
<A NAME="1033"></A>appropriate to the God of war.
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And now, by the Gods, let us have no more of the Gods, 
<A NAME="1036"></A>for I am afraid of them; ask about anything but them, and thou shalt see 
<A NAME="1037"></A>how the steeds of Euthyphro can prance.
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Only one more God! I should like to know about Hermes, 
<A NAME="1039"></A>of whom I am said not to be a true son. Let us make him out, and then I 
<A NAME="1040"></A>shall know whether there is any meaning in what Cratylus 
<A NAME="1041"></A>says.
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I should imagine that the name Hermes has to do with 
<A NAME="1043"></A>speech, and signifies that he is the interpreter (ermeneus), or messenger, 
<A NAME="1044"></A>or thief, or liar, or bargainer; all that sort of thing has a great deal 
<A NAME="1045"></A>to do with language; as I was telling you the word eirein is expressive 
<A NAME="1046"></A>of the use of speech, and there is an often-recurring Homeric word emesato, 
<A NAME="1047"></A>which means "he contrived"- out of these two words, eirein and mesasthai, 
<A NAME="1048"></A>the legislator formed the name of the God who invented language and speech; 
<A NAME="1049"></A>and we may imagine him dictating to us the use of this name: "O my friends," 
<A NAME="1050"></A>says he to us, "seeing that he is the contriver of tales or speeches, you 
<A NAME="1051"></A>may rightly call him Eirhemes." And this has been improved by us, as we 
<A NAME="1052"></A>think, into Hermes. Iris also appears to have been called from the verb 
<A NAME="1053"></A>"to tell" (eirein), because she was a messenger.
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Then I am very sure that Cratylus was quite right in 
<A NAME="1055"></A>saying that I was no true son of Hermes (Ermogenes), for I am not a good 
<A NAME="1056"></A>hand at speeches.
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> There is also reason, my friend, in Pan being the double-formed 
<A NAME="1058"></A>son of Hermes.
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> How do you make that out?
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You are aware that speech signifies all things (pan), 
<A NAME="1061"></A>and is always turning them round and round, and has two forms, true and 
<A NAME="1062"></A>false?
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Certainly.
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Is not the truth that is in him the smooth or sacred 
<A NAME="1065"></A>form which dwells above among the Gods, whereas falsehood dwells among 
<A NAME="1066"></A>men below, and is rough like the goat of tragedy; for tales and falsehoods 
<A NAME="1067"></A>have generally to do with the tragic or goatish life, and tragedy is the 
<A NAME="1068"></A>place of them?
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Then surely Pan, who is the declarer of all things 
<A NAME="1071"></A>(pan) and the perpetual mover (aei polon) of all things, is rightly called 
<A NAME="1072"></A>aipolos (goat-herd), he being the two-formed son of Hermes, smooth in his 
<A NAME="1073"></A>upper part, and rough and goatlike in his lower regions. And, as the son 
<A NAME="1074"></A>of Hermes, he is speech or the brother of speech, and that brother should 
<A NAME="1075"></A>be like brother is no marvel. But, as I was saying, my dear Hermogenes, 
<A NAME="1076"></A>let us get away from the Gods.
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> From these sort of Gods, by all means, Socrates. But 
<A NAME="1078"></A>why should we not discuss another kind of Gods- the sun, moon, stars, earth, 
<A NAME="1079"></A>aether, air, fire, water, the seasons, and the year?
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> You impose a great many tasks upon me. Still, if you 
<A NAME="1081"></A>wish, I will not refuse.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> You will oblige me.
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> How would you have me begin? Shall I take first of 
<A NAME="1084"></A>all him whom you mentioned first- the sun?
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Very good.
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The origin of the sun will probably be clearer in the 
<A NAME="1087"></A>Doric form, for the Dorians call him alios, and this name is given to him 
<A NAME="1088"></A>because when he rises he gathers (alizoi) men together or because he is 
<A NAME="1089"></A>always rolling in his course (aei eilein ion) about the earth; or from 
<A NAME="1090"></A>aiolein, of which meaning is the same as poikillein (to variegate), because 
<A NAME="1091"></A>he variegates the productions of the earth.
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> But what is selene (the moon)?
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That name is rather unfortunate for 
<A NAME="1094"></A>Anaxagoras.
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> How so?
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The word seems to forestall his recent discovery, that 
<A NAME="1097"></A>the moon receives her light from the sun.
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Why do you say so?
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The two words selas (brightness) and phos (light) have 
<A NAME="1100"></A>much the same meaning?
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes.
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> This light about the moon is always new (neon) and 
<A NAME="1103"></A>always old (enon), if the disciples of Anaxagoras say truly. For the sun 
<A NAME="1104"></A>in his revolution always adds new light, and there is the old light of 
<A NAME="1105"></A>the previous month.
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The moon is not unfrequently called 
<A NAME="1108"></A>selanaia.
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> True.
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And as she has a light which is always old and always 
<A NAME="1111"></A>new (enon neon aei) she may very properly have the name selaenoneoaeia; 
<A NAME="1112"></A>and this when hammered into shape becomes selanaia.
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> A real dithyrambic sort of name that, Socrates. But 
<A NAME="1114"></A>what do you say of the month and the stars?
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Meis (month) is called from meiousthai (to lessen), 
<A NAME="1116"></A>because suffering diminution; the name of astra (stars) seems to be derived 
<A NAME="1117"></A>from astrape, which is an improvement on anastphope, signifying the upsetting 
<A NAME="1118"></A>of the eyes (anastrephein opa).
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> What do you say of pur (fire) and udor 
<A NAME="1120"></A>(water)?
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I am at a loss how to explain pur; either the muse 
<A NAME="1122"></A>of Euthyphro has deserted me, or there is some very great difficulty in 
<A NAME="1123"></A>the word. Please, however, to note the contrivance which I adopt whenever 
<A NAME="1124"></A>I am in a difficulty of this sort.
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> What is it?
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I will tell you; but I should like to know first whether 
<A NAME="1127"></A>you can tell me what is the meaning of the pur?
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Indeed I cannot.
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Shall I tell you what I suspect to be the true explanation 
<A NAME="1130"></A>of this and several other words?- My belief is that they are of foreign 
<A NAME="1131"></A>origin. For the Hellenes, especially those who were under the dominion 
<A NAME="1132"></A>of the barbarians, often borrowed from them.
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> What is the inference?
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Why, you know that any one who seeks to demonstrate 
<A NAME="1135"></A>the fitness of these names according to the Hellenic language, and not 
<A NAME="1136"></A>according to the language from which the words are derived, is rather likely 
<A NAME="1137"></A>to be at fault.
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Yes, certainly.
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Well then, consider whether this pur is not foreign; 
<A NAME="1140"></A>for the word is not easily brought into relation with the Hellenic tongue, 
<A NAME="1141"></A>and the Phrygians may be observed to have the same word slightly changed, 
<A NAME="1142"></A>just as they have udor (water) and kunes (dogs), and many other 
<A NAME="1143"></A>words.
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> That is true.
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Any violent interpretations of the words should be 
<A NAME="1146"></A>avoided; for something to say about them may easily be found. And thus 
<A NAME="1147"></A>I get rid of pur and udor. Aer (air), Hermogenes, may be explained as the 
<A NAME="1148"></A>element which raises (airei) things from the earth, or as ever flowing 
<A NAME="1149"></A>(aei pei), or because the flux of the air is wind, and the poets call the 
<A NAME="1150"></A>winds "air-blasts," (aetai); he who uses the term may mean, so to speak, 
<A NAME="1151"></A>air-flux (aetorroun), in the sense of wind-flux (pneumatorroun); and because 
<A NAME="1152"></A>this moving wind may be expressed by either term he employs the word air 
<A NAME="1153"></A>(aer = aetes rheo). Aither (aether) I should interpret as  aeitheer; this 
<A NAME="1154"></A>may be correctly said, because this element is always running in a flux 
<A NAME="1155"></A>about the air (aei thei peri tou aera ron). The meaning of the word ge 
<A NAME="1156"></A>(earth) comes out better when in the form of gaia, for the earth may be 
<A NAME="1157"></A>truly called "mother" (gaia, genneteira), as in the language of Homer (Od. 
<A NAME="1158"></A>ix. 118; xiii. 160) gegaasi means gegennesthai.
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Good.
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> What shall we take next? Her. There are orai (the seasons), 
<A NAME="1161"></A>and the two names of the year, eniautos and etos.
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> The orai should be spelt in the old Attic way, if you 
<A NAME="1163"></A>desire to know the probable truth about them; they are rightly called the 
<A NAME="1164"></A>orai because they divide (orizousin) the summers and winters and winds 
<A NAME="1165"></A>and the fruits of the earth. The words eniautos and etos appear to be the 
<A NAME="1166"></A>same,- "that which brings to light the plants and growths of the earth 
<A NAME="1167"></A>in their turn, and passes them in review within itself (en eauto exetazei)": 
<A NAME="1168"></A>this is broken up into two words, eniautos from en eauto, and etos from 
<A NAME="1169"></A>etazei, just as the original name of Zeus was divided into Zena and Dia; 
<A NAME="1170"></A>and the whole proposition means that his power of reviewing from within 
<A NAME="1171"></A>is one, but has two names, two words etos and eniautos being thus formed 
<A NAME="1172"></A>out of a single proposition.
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Indeed, Socrates, you make surprising 
<A NAME="1174"></A>progress.
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> I am run away with.
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Very true.
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> But am not yet at my utmost speed.
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I should like very much to know, in the next place, 
<A NAME="1179"></A>how you would explain the virtues. What principle of correctness is there 
<A NAME="1180"></A>in those charming words- wisdom, understanding, justice, and the rest of 
<A NAME="1181"></A>them?
<A NAME="1182"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> That is a tremendous class of names which you are disinterring; 
<A NAME="1183"></A>still, as I have put on the lion's skin, I must not be faint of heart; 
<A NAME="1184"></A>and I suppose that I must consider the meaning of wisdom (phronesis) and 
<A NAME="1185"></A>understanding (sunesis), and judgment (gnome), and knowledge (episteme), 
<A NAME="1186"></A>and all those other charming words, as you call them?
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Surely, we must not leave off until we find out their 
<A NAME="1188"></A>meaning.
<A NAME="1189"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> By the dog of Egypt I have not a bad notion which came 
<A NAME="1190"></A>into my head only this moment: I believe that the primeval givers of names 
<A NAME="1191"></A>were undoubtedly like too many of our modern philosophers, who, in their 
<A NAME="1192"></A>search after the nature of things, are always getting dizzy from constantly 
<A NAME="1193"></A>going round and round, and then they imagine that the world is going round 
<A NAME="1194"></A>and round and moving in all directions; and this appearance, which arises 
<A NAME="1195"></A>out of their own internal condition, they suppose to be a reality of nature; 
<A NAME="1196"></A>they think that there is nothing stable or permanent, but only flux and 
<A NAME="1197"></A>motion, and that the world is always full of every sort of motion and change. 
<A NAME="1198"></A>The consideration of the names which I mentioned has led me into making 
<A NAME="1199"></A>this reflection.
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> How is that, Socrates?
<A NAME="1201"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Perhaps you did not observe that in the names which 
<A NAME="1202"></A>have been just cited, the motion or flux or generation of things is most 
<A NAME="1203"></A>surely indicated.
<A NAME="1204"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> No, indeed, I never thought of it.
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> Take the first of those which you mentioned; clearly 
<A NAME="1206"></A>that is a name indicative of motion.
<A NAME="1207"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> What was the name? Soc. Phronesis (wisdom), which may 
<A NAME="1208"></A>signify Phoras kai rhou noesis (perception of motion and flux), or perhaps 
<A NAME="1209"></A>Phoras onesis (the blessing of motion), but is at any rate connected with 
<A NAME="1210"></A>Pheresthai (motion); gnome (judgment), again, certainly implies the ponderation 
<A NAME="1211"></A>or consideration (nomesis) of generation, for to ponder is the same as 
<A NAME="1212"></A>to consider; or, if you would rather, here is noesis, the very word just 
<A NAME="1213"></A>now mentioned, which is neou esis (the desire of the new); the word neos 
<A NAME="1214"></A>implies that the world is always in process of creation. The giver of the 
<A NAME="1215"></A>name wanted to express his longing of the soul, for the original name was 
<A NAME="1216"></A>neoesis, and not noesis. The word sophrosune is the salvation (soteria) 
<A NAME="1217"></A>of that wisdom (phronesis) which we were just now considering. Epioteme 
<A NAME="1218"></A>(knowledge) is akin to this, and indicates that the soul which is good 
<A NAME="1219"></A>for anything follows (epetai) the motion of things, neither anticipating 
<A NAME="1220"></A>them nor falling behind them; wherefor the word should rather be read as 
<A NAME="1221"></A>epistemene, inserting en. Sunesis (understanding) may be regarded in like 
<A NAME="1222"></A>manner as a kind of conclusion; the word is derived from sunienai (to go 
<A NAME="1223"></A>along with), and, like epistasthai (to know), implies the progression of 
<A NAME="1224"></A>the soul in company with the nature of things. Sophia (wisdom) is very 
<A NAME="1225"></A>dark, and appears not to be of native growth; the meaning is, touching 
<A NAME="1226"></A>the motion or stream of things. You must remember that the poets, when 
<A NAME="1227"></A>they speak of the commencement of any rapid motion, often use the word 
<A NAME="1228"></A>esuthe (he rushed); and there was a famous Lacedaemonian who was named 
<A NAME="1229"></A>Sous (Rush), for by this word the Lacedaemonians signify rapid motion, 
<A NAME="1230"></A>and the touching (epaphe) of motion is expressed by sophia, for all things 
<A NAME="1231"></A>are supposed to be in motion. Good (agathon) is the name which is given 
<A NAME="1232"></A>to the admirable (agasto) in nature; for, although all things move, still 
<A NAME="1233"></A>there are degrees of motion; some are swifter, some slower; but there are 
<A NAME="1234"></A>some things which are admirable for their swiftness, and this admirable 
<A NAME="1235"></A>part of nature is called agathon. Dikaiosune (justice) is clearly dikaiou 
<A NAME="1236"></A>sunesis (understanding of the just); but the actual word dikaion is more 
<A NAME="1237"></A>difficult: men are only agreed to a certain extent about justice, and then 
<A NAME="1238"></A>they begin to disagree.
<A NAME="1239"></A><BR><BR>For those who suppose all things to be in motion conceive the greater 
<A NAME="1240"></A>part of nature to be a mere receptacle; and they say that there is a penetrating 
<A NAME="1241"></A>power which passes through all this, and is the instrument of creation 
<A NAME="1242"></A>in all, and is the subtlest and swiftest element; for if it were not the 
<A NAME="1243"></A>subtlest, and a power which none can keep out, and also the swiftest, passing 
<A NAME="1244"></A>by other things as if they were standing still, it could not penetrate 
<A NAME="1245"></A>through the moving universe. And this element, which superintends all things 
<A NAME="1246"></A>and pieces (diaion) all, is rightly called dikaion; the letter k is only 
<A NAME="1247"></A>added for the sake of euphony. Thus far, as I was saying, there is a general 
<A NAME="1248"></A>agreement about the nature of justice; but I, Hermogenes, being an enthusiastic 
<A NAME="1249"></A>disciple, have been told in a mystery that the justice of which I am speaking 
<A NAME="1250"></A>is also the cause of the world: now a cause is that because of which anything 
<A NAME="1251"></A>is created; and some one comes and whispers in my ear that justice is rightly 
<A NAME="1252"></A>so called because partaking of the nature of the cause, and I begin, after 
<A NAME="1253"></A>hearing what he has said, to interrogate him gently: "Well, my excellent 
<A NAME="1254"></A>friend," say I, "but if all this be true, I still want to know what is 
<A NAME="1255"></A>justice." Thereupon they think that I ask tiresome questions, and am leaping 
<A NAME="1256"></A>over the barriers, and have been already sufficiently answered, and they 
<A NAME="1257"></A>try to satisfy me with one derivation after another, and at length they 
<A NAME="1258"></A>quarrel. For one of them says that justice is the sun, and that he only 
<A NAME="1259"></A>is the piercing (diaionta) and burning (kaonta) element which is the guardian 
<A NAME="1260"></A>of nature. And when I joyfully repeat this beautiful notion, I am answered 
<A NAME="1261"></A>by the satirical remark, "What, is there no justice in the world when the 
<A NAME="1262"></A>sun is down?" And when I earnestly beg my questioner to tell me his own 
<A NAME="1263"></A>honest opinion, he says, "Fire in the abstract"; but this is not very intelligible. 
<A NAME="1264"></A>Another says, "No, not fire in the abstract, but the abstraction of heat 
<A NAME="1265"></A>in the fire." Another man professes to laugh at all this, and says, as 
<A NAME="1266"></A>Anaxagoras says, that justice is mind, for mind, as they say, has absolute 
<A NAME="1267"></A>power, and mixes with nothing, and orders all things, and passes through 
<A NAME="1268"></A>all things. At last, my friend, I find myself in far greater perplexity 
<A NAME="1269"></A>about the nature of justice than I was before I began to learn. But still 
<A NAME="1270"></A>I am of opinion that the name, which has led me into this digression, was 
<A NAME="1271"></A>given to justice for the reasons which I have mentioned.
<A NAME="1272"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> I think, Socrates, that you are not improvising now; 
<A NAME="1273"></A>you must have heard this from some one else.
<A NAME="1274"></A><BR><BR><B>Soc.</B> And not the rest?
<A NAME="1275"></A><BR><BR><B>Her.</B> Hardly. Soc. Well, then, let me go on in the hope of 
<A NAME="1276"></A>making you believe in the originality of the rest. What remains after justice? 
<A NAME="1277"></A>I do not think that we have as yet discussed courage (andreia),- injustice 
<A NAME="1278"></A>(adikia), which is obviously nothing more than a hindrance to the penetrating 
<A NAME="1279"></A>principle (diaiontos), need not be considered. Well, then, the name of 
<A NAME="1280"></A>andreia seems to imply a battle;- this battle is in the world of existence,
