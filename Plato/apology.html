<A NAME="10"></A><B>Socrates' Defense</B>

<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>How you have felt, O men of Athens, at hearing the speeches of 
<A NAME="12"></A>my accusers, I cannot tell; but I know that their persuasive words almost 
<A NAME="13"></A>made me forget who I was - such was the effect of them; and yet they have 
<A NAME="14"></A>hardly spoken a word of truth. But many as their falsehoods were, there 
<A NAME="15"></A>was one of them which quite amazed me; - I mean when they told you to be 
<A NAME="16"></A>upon your guard, and not to let yourselves be deceived by the force of 
<A NAME="17"></A>my eloquence. They ought to have been ashamed of saying this, because they 
<A NAME="18"></A>were sure to be detected as soon as I opened my lips and displayed my deficiency; 
<A NAME="19"></A>they certainly did appear to be most shameless in saying this, unless by 
<A NAME="20"></A>the force of eloquence they mean the force of truth; for then I do indeed 
<A NAME="21"></A>admit that I am eloquent. But in how different a way from theirs!  Well, 
<A NAME="22"></A>as I was saying, they have hardly uttered a word, or not more than a word, 
<A NAME="23"></A>of truth; but you shall hear from me the whole truth: not, however, delivered 
<A NAME="24"></A>after their manner, in a set oration duly ornamented with words and phrases. 
<A NAME="25"></A>No indeed!  but I shall use the words and arguments which occur to me at 
<A NAME="26"></A>the moment; for I am certain that this is right, and that at my time of 
<A NAME="27"></A>life I ought not to be appearing before you, O men of Athens, in the character 
<A NAME="28"></A>of a juvenile orator - let no one expect this of me. And I must beg of 
<A NAME="29"></A>you to grant me one favor, which is this - If you hear me using the same 
<A NAME="30"></A>words in my defence which I have been in the habit of using, and which 
<A NAME="31"></A>most of you may have heard in the agora, and at the tables of the money-changers, 
<A NAME="32"></A>or anywhere else, I would ask you not to be surprised at this, and not 
<A NAME="33"></A>to interrupt me.  For I am more than seventy years of age, and this is 
<A NAME="34"></A>the first time that I have ever appeared in a court of law, and I am quite 
<A NAME="35"></A>a stranger to the ways of the place; and therefore I would have you regard 
<A NAME="36"></A>me as if I were really a stranger, whom you would excuse if he spoke in 
<A NAME="37"></A>his native tongue, and after the fashion of his country; - that I think 
<A NAME="38"></A>is not an unfair request. Never mind the manner, which may or may not be 
<A NAME="39"></A>good; but think only of the justice of my cause, and give heed to that: 
<A NAME="40"></A>let the judge decide justly and the speaker speak truly.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>And first, I have to reply to the older charges and to my first 
<A NAME="42"></A>accusers, and then I will go to the later ones. For I have had many accusers, 
<A NAME="43"></A>who accused me of old, and their false charges have continued during many 
<A NAME="44"></A>years; and I am more afraid of them than of Anytus and his associates, 
<A NAME="45"></A>who are dangerous, too, in their own way. But far more dangerous are these, 
<A NAME="46"></A>who began when you were children, and took possession of your minds with 
<A NAME="47"></A>their falsehoods, telling of one Socrates, a wise man, who speculated about 
<A NAME="48"></A>the heaven above, and searched into the earth beneath, and made the worse 
<A NAME="49"></A>appear the better cause. These are the accusers whom I dread; for they 
<A NAME="50"></A>are the circulators of this rumor, and their hearers are too apt to fancy 
<A NAME="51"></A>that speculators of this sort do not believe in the gods. And they are 
<A NAME="52"></A>many, and their charges against me are of ancient date, and they made them 
<A NAME="53"></A>in days when you were impressible - in childhood, or perhaps in youth - 
<A NAME="54"></A>and the cause when heard went by default, for there was none to answer. 
<A NAME="55"></A>And, hardest of all, their names I do not know and cannot tell; unless 
<A NAME="56"></A>in the chance of a comic poet. But the main body of these slanderers who 
<A NAME="57"></A>from envy and malice have wrought upon you - and there are some of them 
<A NAME="58"></A>who are convinced themselves, and impart their convictions to others - 
<A NAME="59"></A>all these, I say, are most difficult to deal with; for I cannot have them 
<A NAME="60"></A>up here, and examine them, and therefore I must simply fight with shadows 
<A NAME="61"></A>in my own defence, and examine when there is no one who answers. I will 
<A NAME="62"></A>ask you then to assume with me, as I was saying, that my opponents are 
<A NAME="63"></A>of two kinds - one recent, the other ancient; and I hope that you will 
<A NAME="64"></A>see the propriety of my answering the latter first, for these accusations 
<A NAME="65"></A>you heard long before the others, and much oftener.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>Well, then, I will make my defence, and I will endeavor in the 
<A NAME="67"></A>short time which is allowed to do away with this evil opinion of me which 
<A NAME="68"></A>you have held for such a long time; and I hope I may succeed, if this be 
<A NAME="69"></A>well for you and me, and that my words may find favor with you. But I know 
<A NAME="70"></A>that to accomplish this is not easy - I quite see the nature of the task. 
<A NAME="71"></A>Let the event be as God wills: in obedience to the law I make my 
<A NAME="72"></A>defence.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>I will begin at the beginning, and ask what the accusation is which 
<A NAME="74"></A>has given rise to this slander of me, and which has encouraged Meletus 
<A NAME="75"></A>to proceed against me. What do the slanderers say? They shall be my prosecutors, 
<A NAME="76"></A>and I will sum up their words in an affidavit. "Socrates is an evil-doer, 
<A NAME="77"></A>and a curious person, who searches into things under the earth and in heaven, 
<A NAME="78"></A>and he makes the worse appear the better cause; and he teaches the aforesaid 
<A NAME="79"></A>doctrines to others." That is the nature of the accusation, and that is 
<A NAME="80"></A>what you have seen yourselves in the comedy of Aristophanes; who has introduced 
<A NAME="81"></A>a man whom he calls Socrates, going about and saying that he can walk in 
<A NAME="82"></A>the air, and talking a deal of nonsense concerning matters of which I do 
<A NAME="83"></A>not pretend to know either much or little - not that I mean to say anything 
<A NAME="84"></A>disparaging of anyone who is a student of natural philosophy. I should 
<A NAME="85"></A>be very sorry if Meletus could lay that to my charge. But the simple truth 
<A NAME="86"></A>is, O Athenians, that I have nothing to do with these studies. Very many 
<A NAME="87"></A>of those here present are witnesses to the truth of this, and to them I 
<A NAME="88"></A>appeal. Speak then, you who have heard me, and tell your neighbors whether 
<A NAME="89"></A>any of you have ever known me hold forth in few words or in many upon matters 
<A NAME="90"></A>of this sort. ... You hear their answer. And from what they say of this 
<A NAME="91"></A>you will be able to judge of the truth of the rest.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>As little foundation is there for the report that I am a teacher, 
<A NAME="93"></A>and take money; that is no more true than the other. Although, if a man 
<A NAME="94"></A>is able to teach, I honor him for being paid. There is Gorgias of Leontium, 
<A NAME="95"></A>and Prodicus of Ceos, and Hippias of Elis, who go the round of the cities, 
<A NAME="96"></A>and are able to persuade the young men to leave their own citizens, by 
<A NAME="97"></A>whom they might be taught for nothing, and come to them, whom they not 
<A NAME="98"></A>only pay, but are thankful if they may be allowed to pay them. There is 
<A NAME="99"></A>actually a Parian philosopher residing in Athens, of whom I have heard; 
<A NAME="100"></A>and I came to hear of him in this way: - I met a man who has spent a world 
<A NAME="101"></A>of money on the Sophists, Callias the son of Hipponicus, and knowing that 
<A NAME="102"></A>he had sons, I asked him: "Callias," I said, "if your two sons were foals 
<A NAME="103"></A>or calves, there would be no difficulty in finding someone to put over 
<A NAME="104"></A>them; we should hire a trainer of horses or a farmer probably who would 
<A NAME="105"></A>improve and perfect them in their own proper virtue and excellence; but 
<A NAME="106"></A>as they are human beings, whom are you thinking of placing over them? Is 
<A NAME="107"></A>there anyone who understands human and political virtue? You must have 
<A NAME="108"></A>thought about this as you have sons; is there anyone?" "There is," he said. 
<A NAME="109"></A>"Who is he?" said I, "and of what country? and what does he charge?" "Evenus 
<A NAME="110"></A>the Parian," he replied; "he is the man, and his charge is five minae." 
<A NAME="111"></A>Happy is Evenus, I said to myself, if he really has this wisdom, and teaches 
<A NAME="112"></A>at such a modest charge. Had I the same, I should have been very proud 
<A NAME="113"></A>and conceited; but the truth is that I have no knowledge of the 
<A NAME="114"></A>kind.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>I dare say, Athenians, that someone among you will reply, "Why 
<A NAME="116"></A>is this, Socrates, and what is the origin of these accusations of you: 
<A NAME="117"></A>for there must have been something strange which you have been doing? All 
<A NAME="118"></A>this great fame and talk about you would never have arisen if you had been 
<A NAME="119"></A>like other men: tell us, then, why this is, as we should be sorry to judge 
<A NAME="120"></A>hastily of you." Now I regard this as a fair challenge, and I will endeavor 
<A NAME="121"></A>to explain to you the origin of this name of "wise," and of this evil fame. 
<A NAME="122"></A>Please to attend then. And although some of you may think I am joking, 
<A NAME="123"></A>I declare that I will tell you the entire truth. Men of Athens, this reputation 
<A NAME="124"></A>of mine has come of a certain sort of wisdom which I possess. If you ask 
<A NAME="125"></A>me what kind of wisdom, I reply, such wisdom as is attainable by man, for 
<A NAME="126"></A>to that extent I am inclined to believe that I am wise; whereas the persons 
<A NAME="127"></A>of whom I was speaking have a superhuman wisdom, which I may fail to describe, 
<A NAME="128"></A>because I have it not myself; and he who says that I have, speaks falsely, 
<A NAME="129"></A>and is taking away my character. And here, O men of Athens, I must beg 
<A NAME="130"></A>you not to interrupt me, even if I seem to say something extravagant. For 
<A NAME="131"></A>the word which I will speak is not mine. I will refer you to a witness 
<A NAME="132"></A>who is worthy of credit, and will tell you about my wisdom - whether I 
<A NAME="133"></A>have any, and of what sort - and that witness shall be the god of Delphi. 
<A NAME="134"></A>You must have known Chaerephon; he was early a friend of mine, and also 
<A NAME="135"></A>a friend of yours, for he shared in the exile of the people, and returned 
<A NAME="136"></A>with you. Well, Chaerephon, as you know, was very impetuous in all his 
<A NAME="137"></A>doings, and he went to Delphi and boldly asked the oracle to tell him whether 
<A NAME="138"></A>- as I was saying, I must beg you not to interrupt - he asked the oracle 
<A NAME="139"></A>to tell him whether there was anyone wiser than I was, and the Pythian 
<A NAME="140"></A>prophetess answered that there was no man wiser. Chaerephon is dead himself, 
<A NAME="141"></A>but his brother, who is in court, will confirm the truth of this 
<A NAME="142"></A>story.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>Why do I mention this? Because I am going to explain to you why 
<A NAME="144"></A>I have such an evil name. When I heard the answer, I said to myself, What 
<A NAME="145"></A>can the god mean? and what is the interpretation of this riddle? for I 
<A NAME="146"></A>know that I have no wisdom, small or great. What can he mean when he says 
<A NAME="147"></A>that I am the wisest of men? And yet he is a god and cannot lie; that would 
<A NAME="148"></A>be against his nature. After a long consideration, I at last thought of 
<A NAME="149"></A>a method of trying the question. I reflected that if I could only find 
<A NAME="150"></A>a man wiser than myself, then I might go to the god with a refutation in 
<A NAME="151"></A>my hand. I should say to him, "Here is a man who is wiser than I am; but 
<A NAME="152"></A>you said that I was the wisest." Accordingly I went to one who had the 
<A NAME="153"></A>reputation of wisdom, and observed to him - his name I need not mention; 
<A NAME="154"></A>he was a politician whom I selected for examination - and the result was 
<A NAME="155"></A>as follows: When I began to talk with him, I could not help thinking that 
<A NAME="156"></A>he was not really wise, although he was thought wise by many, and wiser 
<A NAME="157"></A>still by himself; and I went and tried to explain to him that he thought 
<A NAME="158"></A>himself wise, but was not really wise; and the consequence was that he 
<A NAME="159"></A>hated me, and his enmity was shared by several who were present and heard 
<A NAME="160"></A>me. So I left him, saying to myself, as I went away: Well, although I do 
<A NAME="161"></A>not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good, 
<A NAME="162"></A>I am better off than he is - for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows. 
<A NAME="163"></A>I neither know nor think that I know. In this latter particular, then, 
<A NAME="164"></A>I seem to have slightly the advantage of him. Then I went to another, who 
<A NAME="165"></A>had still higher philosophical pretensions, and my conclusion was exactly 
<A NAME="166"></A>the same. I made another enemy of him, and of many others besides 
<A NAME="167"></A>him.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>After this I went to one man after another, being not unconscious 
<A NAME="169"></A>of the enmity which I provoked, and I lamented and feared this: but necessity 
<A NAME="170"></A>was laid upon me - the word of God, I thought, ought to be considered first. 
<A NAME="171"></A>And I said to myself, Go I must to all who appear to know, and find out 
<A NAME="172"></A>the meaning of the oracle. And I swear to you, Athenians, by the dog I 
<A NAME="173"></A>swear! - for I must tell you the truth - the result of my mission was just 
<A NAME="174"></A>this: I found that the men most in repute were all but the most foolish; 
<A NAME="175"></A>and that some inferior men were really wiser and better. I will tell you 
<A NAME="176"></A>the tale of my wanderings and of the "Herculean" labors, as I may call 
<A NAME="177"></A>them, which I endured only to find at last the oracle irrefutable. When 
<A NAME="178"></A>I left the politicians, I went to the poets; tragic, dithyrambic, and all 
<A NAME="179"></A>sorts. And there, I said to myself, you will be detected; now you will 
<A NAME="180"></A>find out that you are more ignorant than they are. Accordingly, I took 
<A NAME="181"></A>them some of the most elaborate passages in their own writings, and asked 
<A NAME="182"></A>what was the meaning of them - thinking that they would teach me something. 
<A NAME="183"></A>Will you believe me? I am almost ashamed to speak of this, but still I 
<A NAME="184"></A>must say that there is hardly a person present who would not have talked 
<A NAME="185"></A>better about their poetry than they did themselves. That showed me in an 
<A NAME="186"></A>instant that not by wisdom do poets write poetry, but by a sort of genius 
<A NAME="187"></A>and inspiration; they are like diviners or soothsayers who also say many 
<A NAME="188"></A>fine things, but do not understand the meaning of them. And the poets appeared 
<A NAME="189"></A>to me to be much in the same case; and I further observed that upon the 
<A NAME="190"></A>strength of their poetry they believed themselves to be the wisest of men 
<A NAME="191"></A>in other things in which they were not wise. So I departed, conceiving 
<A NAME="192"></A>myself to be superior to them for the same reason that I was superior to 
<A NAME="193"></A>the politicians.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>At last I went to the artisans, for I was conscious that I knew 
<A NAME="195"></A>nothing at all, as I may say, and I was sure that they knew many fine things; 
<A NAME="196"></A>and in this I was not mistaken, for they did know many things of which 
<A NAME="197"></A>I was ignorant, and in this they certainly were wiser than I was. But I 
<A NAME="198"></A>observed that even the good artisans fell into the same error as the poets; 
<A NAME="199"></A>because they were good workmen they thought that they also knew all sorts 
<A NAME="200"></A>of high matters, and this defect in them overshadowed their wisdom - therefore 
<A NAME="201"></A>I asked myself on behalf of the oracle, whether I would like to be as I 
<A NAME="202"></A>was, neither having their knowledge nor their ignorance, or like them in 
<A NAME="203"></A>both; and I made answer to myself and the oracle that I was better off 
<A NAME="204"></A>as I was.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>This investigation has led to my having many enemies of the worst 
<A NAME="206"></A>and most dangerous kind, and has given occasion also to many calumnies, 
<A NAME="207"></A>and I am called wise, for my hearers always imagine that I myself possess 
<A NAME="208"></A>the wisdom which I find wanting in others: but the truth is, O men of Athens, 
<A NAME="209"></A>that God only is wise; and in this oracle he means to say that the wisdom 
<A NAME="210"></A>of men is little or nothing; he is not speaking of Socrates, he is only 
<A NAME="211"></A>using my name as an illustration, as if he said, He, O men, is the wisest, 
<A NAME="212"></A>who, like Socrates, knows that his wisdom is in truth worth nothing. And 
<A NAME="213"></A>so I go my way, obedient to the god, and make inquisition into the wisdom 
<A NAME="214"></A>of anyone, whether citizen or stranger, who appears to be wise; and if 
<A NAME="215"></A>he is not wise, then in vindication of the oracle I show him that he is 
<A NAME="216"></A>not wise; and this occupation quite absorbs me, and I have no time to give 
<A NAME="217"></A>either to any public matter of interest or to any concern of my own, but 
<A NAME="218"></A>I am in utter poverty by reason of my devotion to the 
<A NAME="219"></A>god.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>There is another thing: - young men of the richer classes, who 
<A NAME="221"></A>have not much to do, come about me of their own accord; they like to hear 
<A NAME="222"></A>the pretenders examined, and they often imitate me, and examine others 
<A NAME="223"></A>themselves; there are plenty of persons, as they soon enough discover, 
<A NAME="224"></A>who think that they know something, but really know little or nothing: 
<A NAME="225"></A>and then those who are examined by them instead of being angry with themselves 
<A NAME="226"></A>are angry with me: This confounded Socrates, they say; this villainous 
<A NAME="227"></A>misleader of youth! - and then if somebody asks them, Why, what evil does 
<A NAME="228"></A>he practise or teach? they do not know, and cannot tell; but in order that 
<A NAME="229"></A>they may not appear to be at a loss, they repeat the ready-made charges 
<A NAME="230"></A>which are used against all philosophers about teaching things up in the 
<A NAME="231"></A>clouds and under the earth, and having no gods, and making the worse appear 
<A NAME="232"></A>the better cause; for they do not like to confess that their pretence of 
<A NAME="233"></A>knowledge has been detected - which is the truth: and as they are numerous 
<A NAME="234"></A>and ambitious and energetic, and are all in battle array and have persuasive 
<A NAME="235"></A>tongues, they have filled your ears with their loud and inveterate calumnies. 
<A NAME="236"></A>And this is the reason why my three accusers, Meletus and Anytus and Lycon, 
<A NAME="237"></A>have set upon me; Meletus, who has a quarrel with me on behalf of the poets; 
<A NAME="238"></A>Anytus, on behalf of the craftsmen; Lycon, on behalf of the rhetoricians: 
<A NAME="239"></A>and as I said at the beginning, I cannot expect to get rid of this mass 
<A NAME="240"></A>of calumny all in a moment. And this, O men of Athens, is the truth and 
<A NAME="241"></A>the whole truth; I have concealed nothing, I have dissembled nothing. And 
<A NAME="242"></A>yet I know that this plainness of speech makes them hate me, and what is 
<A NAME="243"></A>their hatred but a proof that I am speaking the truth? - this is the occasion 
<A NAME="244"></A>and reason of their slander of me, as you will find out either in this 
<A NAME="245"></A>or in any future inquiry.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>I have said enough in my defence against the first class of my 
<A NAME="247"></A>accusers; I turn to the second class, who are headed by Meletus, that good 
<A NAME="248"></A>and patriotic man, as he calls himself. And now I will try to defend myself 
<A NAME="249"></A>against them: these new accusers must also have their affidavit read. What 
<A NAME="250"></A>do they say? Something of this sort: - That Socrates is a doer of evil, 
<A NAME="251"></A>and corrupter of the youth, and he does not believe in the gods of the 
<A NAME="252"></A>state, and has other new divinities of his own. That is the sort of charge; 
<A NAME="253"></A>and now let us examine the particular counts. He says that I am a doer 
<A NAME="254"></A>of evil, who corrupt the youth; but I say, O men of Athens, that Meletus 
<A NAME="255"></A>is a doer of evil, and the evil is that he makes a joke of a serious matter, 
<A NAME="256"></A>and is too ready at bringing other men to trial from a pretended zeal and 
<A NAME="257"></A>interest about matters in which he really never had the smallest interest. 
<A NAME="258"></A>And the truth of this I will endeavor to prove.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>Come hither, Meletus, and let me ask a question of you. You think 
<A NAME="260"></A>a great deal about the improvement of youth?
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I do.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>Tell the judges, then, who is their improver; for you must know, 
<A NAME="263"></A>as you have taken the pains to discover their corrupter, and are citing 
<A NAME="264"></A>and accusing me before them. Speak, then, and tell the judges who their 
<A NAME="265"></A>improver is. Observe, Meletus, that you are silent, and have nothing to 
<A NAME="266"></A>say. But is not this rather disgraceful, and a very considerable proof 
<A NAME="267"></A>of what I was saying, that you have no interest in the matter? Speak up, 
<A NAME="268"></A>friend, and tell us who their improver is.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>The laws.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>But that, my good sir, is not my meaning. I want to know who the 
<A NAME="271"></A>person is, who, in the first place, knows the laws.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>The judges, Socrates, who are present in court.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean to say, Meletus, that they are able to instruct 
<A NAME="274"></A>and improve youth?
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>Certainly they are.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>What, all of them, or some only and not others?
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>All of them.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>By the goddess Here, that is good news! There are plenty of improvers, 
<A NAME="279"></A>then. And what do you say of the audience, - do they improve 
<A NAME="280"></A>them?
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>Yes, they do.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>And the senators?
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>Yes, the senators improve them.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>But perhaps the members of the citizen assembly corrupt them? - 
<A NAME="285"></A>or do they too improve them?
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>They improve them.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>Then every Athenian improves and elevates them; all with the exception 
<A NAME="288"></A>of myself; and I alone am their corrupter? Is that what you 
<A NAME="289"></A>affirm?
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>That is what I stoutly affirm.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>I am very unfortunate if that is true. But suppose I ask you a 
<A NAME="292"></A>question: Would you say that this also holds true in the case of horses? 
<A NAME="293"></A>Does one man do them harm and all the world good? Is not the exact opposite 
<A NAME="294"></A>of this true? One man is able to do them good, or at least not many; - 
<A NAME="295"></A>the trainer of horses, that is to say, does them good, and others who have 
<A NAME="296"></A>to do with them rather injure them? Is not that true, Meletus, of horses, 
<A NAME="297"></A>or any other animals? Yes, certainly. Whether you and Anytus say yes or 
<A NAME="298"></A>no, that is no matter. Happy indeed would be the condition of youth if 
<A NAME="299"></A>they had one corrupter only, and all the rest of the world were their improvers. 
<A NAME="300"></A>And you, Meletus, have sufficiently shown that you never had a thought 
<A NAME="301"></A>about the young: your carelessness is seen in your not caring about matters 
<A NAME="302"></A>spoken of in this very indictment.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>And now, Meletus, I must ask you another question: Which is better, 
<A NAME="304"></A>to live among bad citizens, or among good ones? Answer, friend, I say; 
<A NAME="305"></A>for that is a question which may be easily answered. Do not the good do 
<A NAME="306"></A>their neighbors good, and the bad do them evil?
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>And is there anyone who would rather be injured than benefited 
<A NAME="309"></A>by those who live with him? Answer, my good friend; the law requires you 
<A NAME="310"></A>to answer - does anyone like to be injured?
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>And when you accuse me of corrupting and deteriorating the youth, 
<A NAME="313"></A>do you allege that I corrupt them intentionally or unintentionally?
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>Intentionally, I say.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>But you have just admitted that the good do their neighbors good, 
<A NAME="316"></A>and the evil do them evil. Now is that a truth which your superior wisdom 
<A NAME="317"></A>has recognized thus early in life, and am I, at my age, in such darkness 
<A NAME="318"></A>and ignorance as not to know that if a man with whom I have to live is 
<A NAME="319"></A>corrupted by me, I am very likely to be harmed by him, and yet I corrupt 
<A NAME="320"></A>him, and intentionally, too; - that is what you are saying, and of that 
<A NAME="321"></A>you will never persuade me or any other human being. But either I do not 
<A NAME="322"></A>corrupt them, or I corrupt them unintentionally, so that on either view 
<A NAME="323"></A>of the case you lie. If my offence is unintentional, the law has no cognizance 
<A NAME="324"></A>of unintentional offences: you ought to have taken me privately, and warned 
<A NAME="325"></A>and admonished me; for if I had been better advised, I should have left 
<A NAME="326"></A>off doing what I only did unintentionally - no doubt I should; whereas 
<A NAME="327"></A>you hated to converse with me or teach me, but you indicted me in this 
<A NAME="328"></A>court, which is a place not of instruction, but of punishment.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>I have shown, Athenians, as I was saying, that Meletus has no care 
<A NAME="330"></A>at all, great or small, about the matter. But still I should like to know, 
<A NAME="331"></A>Meletus, in what I am affirmed to corrupt the young. I suppose you mean, 
<A NAME="332"></A>as I infer from your indictment, that I teach them not to acknowledge the 
<A NAME="333"></A>gods which the state acknowledges, but some other new divinities or spiritual 
<A NAME="334"></A>agencies in their stead. These are the lessons which corrupt the youth, 
<A NAME="335"></A>as you say.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that I say emphatically.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>Then, by the gods, Meletus, of whom we are speaking, tell me and 
<A NAME="338"></A>the court, in somewhat plainer terms, what you mean! for I do not as yet 
<A NAME="339"></A>understand whether you affirm that I teach others to acknowledge some gods, 
<A NAME="340"></A>and therefore do believe in gods and am not an entire atheist - this you 
<A NAME="341"></A>do not lay to my charge; but only that they are not the same gods which 
<A NAME="342"></A>the city recognizes - the charge is that they are different gods. Or, do 
<A NAME="343"></A>you mean to say that I am an atheist simply, and a teacher of 
<A NAME="344"></A>atheism?
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>I mean the latter - that you are a complete 
<A NAME="346"></A>atheist.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>That is an extraordinary statement, Meletus. Why do you say that? 
<A NAME="348"></A>Do you mean that I do not believe in the godhead of the sun or moon, which 
<A NAME="349"></A>is the common creed of all men?
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>I assure you, judges, that he does not believe in them; for he 
<A NAME="351"></A>says that the sun is stone, and the moon earth.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>Friend Meletus, you think that you are accusing Anaxagoras; and 
<A NAME="353"></A>you have but a bad opinion of the judges, if you fancy them ignorant to 
<A NAME="354"></A>such a degree as not to know that those doctrines are found in the books 
<A NAME="355"></A>of Anaxagoras the Clazomenian, who is full of them. And these are the doctrines 
<A NAME="356"></A>which the youth are said to learn of Socrates, when there are not unfrequently 
<A NAME="357"></A>exhibitions of them at the theatre (price of admission one drachma at the 
<A NAME="358"></A>most); and they might cheaply purchase them, and laugh at Socrates if he 
<A NAME="359"></A>pretends to father such eccentricities. And so, Meletus, you really think 
<A NAME="360"></A>that I do not believe in any god?
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>I swear by Zeus that you believe absolutely in none at 
<A NAME="362"></A>all.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>You are a liar, Meletus, not believed even by yourself. For I cannot 
<A NAME="364"></A>help thinking, O men of Athens, that Meletus is reckless and impudent, 
<A NAME="365"></A>and that he has written this indictment in a spirit of mere wantonness 
<A NAME="366"></A>and youthful bravado. Has he not compounded a riddle, thinking to try me? 
<A NAME="367"></A>He said to himself: - I shall see whether this wise Socrates will discover 
<A NAME="368"></A>my ingenious contradiction, or whether I shall be able to deceive him and 
<A NAME="369"></A>the rest of them. For he certainly does appear to me to contradict himself 
<A NAME="370"></A>in the indictment as much as if he said that Socrates is guilty of not 
<A NAME="371"></A>believing in the gods, and yet of believing in them - but this surely is 
<A NAME="372"></A>a piece of fun.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>I should like you, O men of Athens, to join me in examining what 
<A NAME="374"></A>I conceive to be his inconsistency; and do you, Meletus, answer. And I 
<A NAME="375"></A>must remind you that you are not to interrupt me if I speak in my accustomed 
<A NAME="376"></A>manner.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>Did ever man, Meletus, believe in the existence of human things, 
<A NAME="378"></A>and not of human beings? ... I wish, men of Athens, that he would answer, 
<A NAME="379"></A>and not be always trying to get up an interruption. Did ever any man believe 
<A NAME="380"></A>in horsemanship, and not in horses? or in flute-playing, and not in flute-players? 
<A NAME="381"></A>No, my friend; I will answer to you and to the court, as you refuse to 
<A NAME="382"></A>answer for yourself. There is no man who ever did. But now please to answer 
<A NAME="383"></A>the next question: Can a man believe in spiritual and divine agencies, 
<A NAME="384"></A>and not in spirits or demigods?
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>He cannot.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>I am glad that I have extracted that answer, by the assistance 
<A NAME="387"></A>of the court; nevertheless you swear in the indictment that I teach and 
<A NAME="388"></A>believe in divine or spiritual agencies (new or old, no matter for that); 
<A NAME="389"></A>at any rate, I believe in spiritual agencies, as you say and swear in the 
<A NAME="390"></A>affidavit; but if I believe in divine beings, I must believe in spirits 
<A NAME="391"></A>or demigods; - is not that true? Yes, that is true, for I may assume that 
<A NAME="392"></A>your silence gives assent to that. Now what are spirits or demigods? are 
<A NAME="393"></A>they not either gods or the sons of gods? Is that true?
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that is true.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>But this is just the ingenious riddle of which I was speaking: 
<A NAME="396"></A>the demigods or spirits are gods, and you say first that I don't believe 
<A NAME="397"></A>in gods, and then again that I do believe in gods; that is, if I believe 
<A NAME="398"></A>in demigods. For if the demigods are the illegitimate sons of gods, whether 
<A NAME="399"></A>by the Nymphs or by any other mothers, as is thought, that, as all men 
<A NAME="400"></A>will allow, necessarily implies the existence of their parents. You might 
<A NAME="401"></A>as well affirm the existence of mules, and deny that of horses and asses. 
<A NAME="402"></A>Such nonsense, Meletus, could only have been intended by you as a trial 
<A NAME="403"></A>of me. You have put this into the indictment because you had nothing real 
<A NAME="404"></A>of which to accuse me. But no one who has a particle of understanding will 
<A NAME="405"></A>ever be convinced by you that the same man can believe in divine and superhuman 
<A NAME="406"></A>things, and yet not believe that there are gods and demigods and 
<A NAME="407"></A>heroes.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>I have said enough in answer to the charge of Meletus: any elaborate 
<A NAME="409"></A>defence is unnecessary; but as I was saying before, I certainly have many 
<A NAME="410"></A>enemies, and this is what will be my destruction if I am destroyed; of 
<A NAME="411"></A>that I am certain; - not Meletus, nor yet Anytus, but the envy and detraction 
<A NAME="412"></A>of the world, which has been the death of many good men, and will probably 
<A NAME="413"></A>be the death of many more; there is no danger of my being the last of 
<A NAME="414"></A>them.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>Someone will say: And are you not ashamed, Socrates, of a course 
<A NAME="416"></A>of life which is likely to bring you to an untimely end? To him I may fairly 
<A NAME="417"></A>answer: There you are mistaken: a man who is good for anything ought not 
<A NAME="418"></A>to calculate the chance of living or dying; he ought only to consider whether 
<A NAME="419"></A>in doing anything he is doing right or wrong - acting the part of a good 
<A NAME="420"></A>man or of a bad. Whereas, according to your view, the heroes who fell at 
<A NAME="421"></A>Troy were not good for much, and the son of Thetis above all, who altogether 
<A NAME="422"></A>despised danger in comparison with disgrace; and when his goddess mother 
<A NAME="423"></A>said to him, in his eagerness to slay Hector, that if he avenged his companion 
<A NAME="424"></A>Patroclus, and slew Hector, he would die himself - "Fate," as she said, 
<A NAME="425"></A>"waits upon you next after Hector"; he, hearing this, utterly despised 
<A NAME="426"></A>danger and death, and instead of fearing them, feared rather to live in 
<A NAME="427"></A>dishonor, and not to avenge his friend.  "Let me die next," he replies, 
<A NAME="428"></A>"and be avenged of my enemy, rather than abide here by the beaked ships, 
<A NAME="429"></A>a scorn and a burden of the earth." Had Achilles any thought of death and 
<A NAME="430"></A>danger? For wherever a man's place is, whether the place which he has chosen 
<A NAME="431"></A>or that in which he has been placed by a commander, there he ought to remain 
<A NAME="432"></A>in the hour of danger; he should not think of death or of anything, but 
<A NAME="433"></A>of disgrace. And this, O men of Athens, is a true saying.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>Strange, indeed, would be my conduct, O men of Athens, if I who, 
<A NAME="435"></A>when I was ordered by the generals whom you chose to command me at Potidaea 
<A NAME="436"></A>and Amphipolis and Delium, remained where they placed me, like any other 
<A NAME="437"></A>man, facing death; if, I say, now, when, as I conceive and imagine, God 
<A NAME="438"></A>orders me to fulfil the philosopher's mission of searching into myself 
<A NAME="439"></A>and other men, I were to desert my post through fear of death, or any other 
<A NAME="440"></A>fear; that would indeed be strange, and I might justly be arraigned in 
<A NAME="441"></A>court for denying the existence of the gods, if I disobeyed the oracle 
<A NAME="442"></A>because I was afraid of death: then I should be fancying that I was wise 
<A NAME="443"></A>when I was not wise. For this fear of death is indeed the pretence of wisdom, 
<A NAME="444"></A>and not real wisdom, being the appearance of knowing the unknown; since 
<A NAME="445"></A>no one knows whether death, which they in their fear apprehend to be the 
<A NAME="446"></A>greatest evil, may not be the greatest good. Is there not here conceit 
<A NAME="447"></A>of knowledge, which is a disgraceful sort of ignorance? And this is the 
<A NAME="448"></A>point in which, as I think, I am superior to men in general, and in which 
<A NAME="449"></A>I might perhaps fancy myself wiser than other men, - that whereas I know 
<A NAME="450"></A>but little of the world below, I do not suppose that I know: but I do know 
<A NAME="451"></A>that injustice and disobedience to a better, whether God or man, is evil 
<A NAME="452"></A>and dishonorable, and I will never fear or avoid a possible good rather 
<A NAME="453"></A>than a certain evil. And therefore if you let me go now, and reject the 
<A NAME="454"></A>counsels of Anytus, who said that if I were not put to death I ought not 
<A NAME="455"></A>to have been prosecuted, and that if I escape now, your sons will all be 
<A NAME="456"></A>utterly ruined by listening to my words - if you say to me, Socrates, this 
<A NAME="457"></A>time we will not mind Anytus, and will let you off, but upon one condition, 
<A NAME="458"></A>that are to inquire and speculate in this way any more, and that if you 
<A NAME="459"></A>are caught doing this again you shall die; - if this was the condition 
<A NAME="460"></A>on which you let me go, I should reply: Men of Athens, I honor and love 
<A NAME="461"></A>you; but I shall obey God rather than you, and while I have life and strength 
<A NAME="462"></A>I shall never cease from the practice and teaching of philosophy, exhorting 
<A NAME="463"></A>anyone whom I meet after my manner, and convincing him, saying: O my friend, 
<A NAME="464"></A>why do you who are a citizen of the great and mighty and wise city of Athens, 
<A NAME="465"></A>care so much about laying up the greatest amount of money and honor and 
<A NAME="466"></A>reputation, and so little about wisdom and truth and the greatest improvement 
<A NAME="467"></A>of the soul, which you never regard or heed at all? Are you not ashamed 
<A NAME="468"></A>of this? And if the person with whom I am arguing says: Yes, but I do care; 
<A NAME="469"></A>I do not depart or let him go at once; I interrogate and examine and cross-examine 
<A NAME="470"></A>him, and if I think that he has no virtue, but only says that he has, I 
<A NAME="471"></A>reproach him with undervaluing the greater, and overvaluing the less. And 
<A NAME="472"></A>this I should say to everyone whom I meet, young and old, citizen and alien, 
<A NAME="473"></A>but especially to the citizens, inasmuch as they are my brethren. For this 
<A NAME="474"></A>is the command of God, as I would have you know; and I believe that to 
<A NAME="475"></A>this day no greater good has ever happened in the state than my service 
<A NAME="476"></A>to the God. For I do nothing but go about persuading you all, old and young 
<A NAME="477"></A>alike, not to take thought for your persons and your properties, but first 
<A NAME="478"></A>and chiefly to care about the greatest improvement of the soul. I tell 
<A NAME="479"></A>you that virtue is not given by money, but that from virtue come money 
<A NAME="480"></A>and every other good of man, public as well as private. This is my teaching, 
<A NAME="481"></A>and if this is the doctrine which corrupts the youth, my influence is ruinous 
<A NAME="482"></A>indeed. But if anyone says that this is not my teaching, he is speaking 
<A NAME="483"></A>an untruth. Wherefore, O men of Athens, I say to you, do as Anytus bids 
<A NAME="484"></A>or not as Anytus bids, and either acquit me or not; but whatever you do, 
<A NAME="485"></A>know that I shall never alter my ways, not even if I have to die many 
<A NAME="486"></A>times.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>Men of Athens, do not interrupt, but hear me; there was an agreement 
<A NAME="488"></A>between us that you should hear me out. And I think that what I am going 
<A NAME="489"></A>to say will do you good: for I have something more to say, at which you 
<A NAME="490"></A>may be inclined to cry out; but I beg that you will not do this. I would 
<A NAME="491"></A>have you know that, if you kill such a one as I am, you will injure yourselves 
<A NAME="492"></A>more than you will injure me. Meletus and Anytus will not injure me: they 
<A NAME="493"></A>cannot; for it is not in the nature of things that a bad man should injure 
<A NAME="494"></A>a better than himself. I do not deny that he may, perhaps, kill him, or 
<A NAME="495"></A>drive him into exile, or deprive him of civil rights; and he may imagine, 
<A NAME="496"></A>and others may imagine, that he is doing him a great injury: but in that 
<A NAME="497"></A>I do not agree with him; for the evil of doing as Anytus is doing - of 
<A NAME="498"></A>unjustly taking away another man's life - is greater far. And now, Athenians, 
<A NAME="499"></A>I am not going to argue for my own sake, as you may think, but for yours, 
<A NAME="500"></A>that you may not sin against the God, or lightly reject his boon by condemning 
<A NAME="501"></A>me. For if you kill me you will not easily find another like me, who, if 
<A NAME="502"></A>I may use such a ludicrous figure of speech, am a sort of gadfly, given 
<A NAME="503"></A>to the state by the God; and the state is like a great and noble steed 
<A NAME="504"></A>who is tardy in his motions owing to his very size, and requires to be 
<A NAME="505"></A>stirred into life. I am that gadfly which God has given the state and all 
<A NAME="506"></A>day long and in all places am always fastening upon you, arousing and persuading 
<A NAME="507"></A>and reproaching you. And as you will not easily find another like me, I 
<A NAME="508"></A>would advise you to spare me. I dare say that you may feel irritated at 
<A NAME="509"></A>being suddenly awakened when you are caught napping; and you may think 
<A NAME="510"></A>that if you were to strike me dead, as Anytus advises, which you easily 
<A NAME="511"></A>might, then you would sleep on for the remainder of your lives, unless 
<A NAME="512"></A>God in his care of you gives you another gadfly. And that I am given to 
<A NAME="513"></A>you by God is proved by this: - that if I had been like other men, I should 
<A NAME="514"></A>not have neglected all my own concerns, or patiently seen the neglect of 
<A NAME="515"></A>them during all these years, and have been doing yours, coming to you individually, 
<A NAME="516"></A>like a father or elder brother, exhorting you to regard virtue; this I 
<A NAME="517"></A>say, would not be like human nature. And had I gained anything, or if my 
<A NAME="518"></A>exhortations had been paid, there would have been some sense in that: but 
<A NAME="519"></A>now, as you will perceive, not even the impudence of my accusers dares 
<A NAME="520"></A>to say that I have ever exacted or sought pay of anyone; they have no witness 
<A NAME="521"></A>of that. And I have a witness of the truth of what I say; my poverty is 
<A NAME="522"></A>a sufficient witness.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>Someone may wonder why I go about in private, giving advice and 
<A NAME="524"></A>busying myself with the concerns of others, but do not venture to come 
<A NAME="525"></A>forward in public and advise the state. I will tell you the reason of this. 
<A NAME="526"></A>You have often heard me speak of an oracle or sign which comes to me, and 
<A NAME="527"></A>is the divinity which Meletus ridicules in the indictment. This sign I 
<A NAME="528"></A>have had ever since I was a child. The sign is a voice which comes to me 
<A NAME="529"></A>and always forbids me to do something which I am going to do, but never 
<A NAME="530"></A>commands me to do anything, and this is what stands in the way of my being 
<A NAME="531"></A>a politician. And rightly, as I think. For I am certain, O men of Athens, 
<A NAME="532"></A>that if I had engaged in politics, I should have perished long ago and 
<A NAME="533"></A>done no good either to you or to myself. And don't be offended at my telling 
<A NAME="534"></A>you the truth: for the truth is that no man who goes to war with you or 
<A NAME="535"></A>any other multitude, honestly struggling against the commission of unrighteousness 
<A NAME="536"></A>and wrong in the state, will save his life; he who will really fight for 
<A NAME="537"></A>the right, if he would live even for a little while, must have a private 
<A NAME="538"></A>station and not a public one.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>I can give you as proofs of this, not words only, but deeds, which 
<A NAME="540"></A>you value more than words. Let me tell you a passage of my own life, which 
<A NAME="541"></A>will prove to you that I should never have yielded to injustice from any 
<A NAME="542"></A>fear of death, and that if I had not yielded I should have died at once. 
<A NAME="543"></A>I will tell you a story - tasteless, perhaps, and commonplace, but nevertheless 
<A NAME="544"></A>true. The only office of state which I ever held, O men of Athens, was 
<A NAME="545"></A>that of senator; the tribe Antiochis, which is my tribe, had the presidency 
<A NAME="546"></A>at the trial of the generals who had not taken up the bodies of the slain 
<A NAME="547"></A>after the battle of Arginusae; and you proposed to try them all together, 
<A NAME="548"></A>which was illegal, as you all thought afterwards; but at the time I was 
<A NAME="549"></A>the only one of the Prytanes who was opposed to the illegality, and I gave 
<A NAME="550"></A>my vote against you; and when the orators threatened to impeach and arrest 
<A NAME="551"></A>me, and have me taken away, and you called and shouted, I made up my mind 
<A NAME="552"></A>that I would run the risk, having law and justice with me, rather than 
<A NAME="553"></A>take part in your injustice because I feared imprisonment and death. This 
<A NAME="554"></A>happened in the days of the democracy. But when the oligarchy of the Thirty 
<A NAME="555"></A>was in power, they sent for me and four others into the rotunda, and bade 
<A NAME="556"></A>us bring Leon the Salaminian from Salamis, as they wanted to execute him. 
<A NAME="557"></A>This was a specimen of the sort of commands which they were always giving 
<A NAME="558"></A>with the view of implicating as many as possible in their crimes; and then 
<A NAME="559"></A>I showed, not in words only, but in deed, that, if I may be allowed to 
<A NAME="560"></A>use such an expression, I cared not a straw for death, and that my only 
<A NAME="561"></A>fear was the fear of doing an unrighteous or unholy thing. For the strong 
<A NAME="562"></A>arm of that oppressive power did not frighten me into doing wrong; and 
<A NAME="563"></A>when we came out of the rotunda the other four went to Salamis and fetched 
<A NAME="564"></A>Leon, but I went quietly home. For which I might have lost my life, had 
<A NAME="565"></A>not the power of the Thirty shortly afterwards come to an end. And to this 
<A NAME="566"></A>many will witness.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR>Now do you really imagine that I could have survived all these 
<A NAME="568"></A>years, if I had led a public life, supposing that like a good man I had 
<A NAME="569"></A>always supported the right and had made justice, as I ought, the first 
<A NAME="570"></A>thing? No, indeed, men of Athens, neither I nor any other. But I have been 
<A NAME="571"></A>always the same in all my actions, public as well as private, and never 
<A NAME="572"></A>have I yielded any base compliance to those who are slanderously termed 
<A NAME="573"></A>my disciples or to any other.  For the truth is that I have no regular 
<A NAME="574"></A>disciples: but if anyone likes to come and hear me while I am pursuing 
<A NAME="575"></A>my mission, whether he be young or old, he may freely come. Nor do I converse 
<A NAME="576"></A>with those who pay only, and not with those who do not pay; but anyone, 
<A NAME="577"></A>whether he be rich or poor, may ask and answer me and listen to my words; 
<A NAME="578"></A>and whether he turns out to be a bad man or a good one, that cannot be 
<A NAME="579"></A>justly laid to my charge, as I never taught him anything. And if anyone 
<A NAME="580"></A>says that he has ever learned or heard anything from me in private which 
<A NAME="581"></A>all the world has not heard, I should like you to know that he is speaking 
<A NAME="582"></A>an untruth.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR>But I shall be asked, Why do people delight in continually conversing 
<A NAME="584"></A>with you? I have told you already, Athenians, the whole truth about this: 
<A NAME="585"></A>they like to hear the cross-examination of the pretenders to wisdom; there 
<A NAME="586"></A>is amusement in this. And this is a duty which the God has imposed upon 
<A NAME="587"></A>me, as I am assured by oracles, visions, and in every sort of way in which 
<A NAME="588"></A>the will of divine power was ever signified to anyone. This is true, O 
<A NAME="589"></A>Athenians; or, if not true, would be soon refuted. For if I am really corrupting 
<A NAME="590"></A>the youth, and have corrupted some of them already, those of them who have 
<A NAME="591"></A>grown up and have become sensible that I gave them bad advice in the days 
<A NAME="592"></A>of their youth should come forward as accusers and take their revenge; 
<A NAME="593"></A>and if they do not like to come themselves, some of their relatives, fathers, 
<A NAME="594"></A>brothers, or other kinsmen, should say what evil their families suffered 
<A NAME="595"></A>at my hands. Now is their time. Many of them I see in the court. There 
<A NAME="596"></A>is Crito, who is of the same age and of the same deme with myself; and 
<A NAME="597"></A>there is Critobulus his son, whom I also see. Then again there is Lysanias 
<A NAME="598"></A>of Sphettus, who is the father of Aeschines - he is present; and also there 
<A NAME="599"></A>is Antiphon of Cephisus, who is the father of Epignes; and there are the 
<A NAME="600"></A>brothers of several who have associated with me. There is Nicostratus the 
<A NAME="601"></A>son of Theosdotides, and the brother of Theodotus (now Theodotus himself 
<A NAME="602"></A>is dead, and therefore he, at any rate, will not seek to stop him); and 
<A NAME="603"></A>there is Paralus the son of Demodocus, who had a brother Theages; and Adeimantus 
<A NAME="604"></A>the son of Ariston, whose brother Plato is present; and Aeantodorus, who 
<A NAME="605"></A>is the brother of Apollodorus, whom I also see. I might mention a great 
<A NAME="606"></A>many others, any of whom Meletus should have produced as witnesses in the 
<A NAME="607"></A>course of his speech; and let him still produce them, if he has forgotten 
<A NAME="608"></A>- I will make way for him. And let him say, if he has any testimony of 
<A NAME="609"></A>the sort which he can produce. Nay, Athenians, the very opposite is the 
<A NAME="610"></A>truth. For all these are ready to witness on behalf of the corrupter, of 
<A NAME="611"></A>the destroyer of their kindred, as Meletus and Anytus call me; not the 
<A NAME="612"></A>corrupted youth only - there might have been a motive for that - but their 
<A NAME="613"></A>uncorrupted elder relatives. Why should they too support me with their 
<A NAME="614"></A>testimony? Why, indeed, except for the sake of truth and justice, and because 
<A NAME="615"></A>they know that I am speaking the truth, and that Meletus is 
<A NAME="616"></A>lying.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR>Well, Athenians, this and the like of this is nearly all the defence 
<A NAME="618"></A>which I have to offer. Yet a word more. Perhaps there may be someone who 
<A NAME="619"></A>is offended at me, when he calls to mind how he himself, on a similar or 
<A NAME="620"></A>even a less serious occasion, had recourse to prayers and supplications 
<A NAME="621"></A>with many tears, and how he produced his children in court, which was a 
<A NAME="622"></A>moving spectacle, together with a posse of his relations and friends; whereas 
<A NAME="623"></A>I, who am probably in danger of my life, will do none of these things. 
<A NAME="624"></A>Perhaps this may come into his mind, and he may be set against me, and 
<A NAME="625"></A>vote in anger because he is displeased at this. Now if there be such a 
<A NAME="626"></A>person among you, which I am far from affirming, I may fairly reply to 
<A NAME="627"></A>him: My friend, I am a man, and like other men, a creature of flesh and 
<A NAME="628"></A>blood, and not of wood or stone, as Homer says; and I have a family, yes, 
<A NAME="629"></A>and sons. O Athenians, three in number, one of whom is growing up, and 
<A NAME="630"></A>the two others are still young; and yet I will not bring any of them hither 
<A NAME="631"></A>in order to petition you for an acquittal. And why not? Not from any self-will 
<A NAME="632"></A>or disregard of you. Whether I am or am not afraid of death is another 
<A NAME="633"></A>question, of which I will not now speak. But my reason simply is that I 
<A NAME="634"></A>feel such conduct to be discreditable to myself, and you, and the whole 
<A NAME="635"></A>state. One who has reached my years, and who has a name for wisdom, whether 
<A NAME="636"></A>deserved or not, ought not to debase himself. At any rate, the world has 
<A NAME="637"></A>decided that Socrates is in some way superior to other men. And if those 
<A NAME="638"></A>among you who are said to be superior in wisdom and courage, and any other 
<A NAME="639"></A>virtue, demean themselves in this way, how shameful is their conduct! I 
<A NAME="640"></A>have seen men of reputation, when they have been condemned, behaving in 
<A NAME="641"></A>the strangest manner: they seemed to fancy that they were going to suffer 
<A NAME="642"></A>something dreadful if they died, and that they could be immortal if you 
<A NAME="643"></A>only allowed them to live; and I think that they were a dishonor to the 
<A NAME="644"></A>state, and that any stranger coming in would say of them that the most 
<A NAME="645"></A>eminent men of Athens, to whom the Athenians themselves give honor and 
<A NAME="646"></A>command, are no better than women. And I say that these things ought not 
<A NAME="647"></A>to be done by those of us who are of reputation; and if they are done, 
<A NAME="648"></A>you ought not to permit them; you ought rather to show that you are more 
<A NAME="649"></A>inclined to condemn, not the man who is quiet, but the man who gets up 
<A NAME="650"></A>a doleful scene, and makes the city ridiculous.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR>But, setting aside the question of dishonor, there seems to be 
<A NAME="652"></A>something wrong in petitioning a judge, and thus procuring an acquittal 
<A NAME="653"></A>instead of informing and convincing him. For his duty is, not to make a 
<A NAME="654"></A>present of justice, but to give judgment; and he has sworn that he will 
<A NAME="655"></A>judge according to the laws, and not according to his own good pleasure; 
<A NAME="656"></A>and neither he nor we should get into the habit of perjuring ourselves 
<A NAME="657"></A>- there can be no piety in that. Do not then require me to do what I consider 
<A NAME="658"></A>dishonorable and impious and wrong, especially now, when I am being tried 
<A NAME="659"></A>for impiety on the indictment of Meletus. For if, O men of Athens, by force 
<A NAME="660"></A>of persuasion and entreaty, I could overpower your oaths, then I should 
<A NAME="661"></A>be teaching you to believe that there are no gods, and convict myself, 
<A NAME="662"></A>in my own defence, of not believing in them. But that is not the case; 
<A NAME="663"></A>for I do believe that there are gods, and in a far higher sense than that 
<A NAME="664"></A>in which any of my accusers believe in them. And to you and to God I commit 
<A NAME="665"></A>my cause, to be determined by you as is best for you and 
<A NAME="666"></A>me.
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR><BR><I>The jury finds Socrates guilty.</I>

<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR><B>Socrates' Proposal for his Sentence</B>

<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>There are many reasons why I am not grieved, O men of Athens, at 
<A NAME="670"></A>the vote of condemnation. I expected it, and am only surprised that the 
<A NAME="671"></A>votes are so nearly equal; for I had thought that the majority against 
<A NAME="672"></A>me would have been far larger; but now, had thirty votes gone over to the 
<A NAME="673"></A>other side, I should have been acquitted. And I may say that I have escaped 
<A NAME="674"></A>Meletus. And I may say more; for without the assistance of Anytus and Lycon, 
<A NAME="675"></A>he would not have had a fifth part of the votes, as the law requires, in 
<A NAME="676"></A>which case he would have incurred a fine of a thousand drachmae, as is 
<A NAME="677"></A>evident.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>And so he proposes death as the penalty. And what shall I propose 
<A NAME="679"></A>on my part, O men of Athens? Clearly that which is my due. And what is 
<A NAME="680"></A>that which I ought to pay or to receive? What shall be done to the man 
<A NAME="681"></A>who has never had the wit to be idle during his whole life; but has been 
<A NAME="682"></A>careless of what the many care about - wealth, and family interests, and 
<A NAME="683"></A>military offices, and speaking in the assembly, and magistracies, and plots, 
<A NAME="684"></A>and parties. Reflecting that I was really too honest a man to follow in 
<A NAME="685"></A>this way and live, I did not go where I could do no good to you or to myself; 
<A NAME="686"></A>but where I could do the greatest good privately to everyone of you, thither 
<A NAME="687"></A>I went, and sought to persuade every man among you that he must look to 
<A NAME="688"></A>himself, and seek virtue and wisdom before he looks to his private interests, 
<A NAME="689"></A>and look to the state before he looks to the interests of the state; and 
<A NAME="690"></A>that this should be the order which he observes in all his actions. What 
<A NAME="691"></A>shall be done to such a one? Doubtless some good thing, O men of Athens, 
<A NAME="692"></A>if he has his reward; and the good should be of a kind suitable to him. 
<A NAME="693"></A>What would be a reward suitable to a poor man who is your benefactor, who 
<A NAME="694"></A>desires leisure that he may instruct you? There can be no more fitting 
<A NAME="695"></A>reward than maintenance in the Prytaneum, O men of Athens, a reward which 
<A NAME="696"></A>he deserves far more than the citizen who has won the prize at Olympia 
<A NAME="697"></A>in the horse or chariot race, whether the chariots were drawn by two horses 
<A NAME="698"></A>or by many. For I am in want, and he has enough; and he only gives you 
<A NAME="699"></A>the appearance of happiness, and I give you the reality. And if I am to 
<A NAME="700"></A>estimate the penalty justly, I say that maintenance in the Prytaneum is 
<A NAME="701"></A>the just return.
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps you may think that I am braving you in saying this, as 
<A NAME="703"></A>in what I said before about the tears and prayers. But that is not the 
<A NAME="704"></A>case. I speak rather because I am convinced that I never intentionally 
<A NAME="705"></A>wronged anyone, although I cannot convince you of that - for we have had 
<A NAME="706"></A>a short conversation only; but if there were a law at Athens, such as there 
<A NAME="707"></A>is in other cities, that a capital cause should not be decided in one day, 
<A NAME="708"></A>then I believe that I should have convinced you; but now the time is too 
<A NAME="709"></A>short. I cannot in a moment refute great slanders; and, as I am convinced 
<A NAME="710"></A>that I never wronged another, I will assuredly not wrong myself. I will 
<A NAME="711"></A>not say of myself that I deserve any evil, or propose any penalty. Why 
<A NAME="712"></A>should I? Because I am afraid of the penalty of death which Meletus proposes? 
<A NAME="713"></A>When I do not know whether death is a good or an evil, why should I propose 
<A NAME="714"></A>a penalty which would certainly be an evil? Shall I say imprisonment? And 
<A NAME="715"></A>why should I live in prison, and be the slave of the magistrates of the 
<A NAME="716"></A>year - of the Eleven? Or shall the penalty be a fine, and imprisonment 
<A NAME="717"></A>until the fine is paid? There is the same objection. I should have to lie 
<A NAME="718"></A>in prison, for money I have none, and I cannot pay. And if I say exile 
<A NAME="719"></A>(and this may possibly be the penalty which you will affix), I must indeed 
<A NAME="720"></A>be blinded by the love of life if I were to consider that when you, who 
<A NAME="721"></A>are my own citizens, cannot endure my discourses and words, and have found 
<A NAME="722"></A>them so grievous and odious that you would fain have done with them, others 
<A NAME="723"></A>are likely to endure me. No, indeed, men of Athens, that is not very likely. 
<A NAME="724"></A>And what a life should I lead, at my age, wandering from city to city, 
<A NAME="725"></A>living in ever-changing exile, and always being driven out! For I am quite 
<A NAME="726"></A>sure that into whatever place I go, as here so also there, the young men 
<A NAME="727"></A>will come to me; and if I drive them away, their elders will drive me out 
<A NAME="728"></A>at their desire: and if I let them come, their fathers and friends will 
<A NAME="729"></A>drive me out for their sakes.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR><BR>Someone will say: Yes, Socrates, but cannot you hold your tongue, 
<A NAME="731"></A>and then you may go into a foreign city, and no one will interfere with 
<A NAME="732"></A>you? Now I have great difficulty in making you understand my answer to 
<A NAME="733"></A>this. For if I tell you that this would be a disobedience to a divine command, 
<A NAME="734"></A>and therefore that I cannot hold my tongue, you will not believe that I 
<A NAME="735"></A>am serious; and if I say again that the greatest good of man is daily to 
<A NAME="736"></A>converse about virtue, and all that concerning which you hear me examining 
<A NAME="737"></A>myself and others, and that the life which is unexamined is not worth living 
<A NAME="738"></A>- that you are still less likely to believe. And yet what I say is true, 
<A NAME="739"></A>although a thing of which it is hard for me to persuade you. Moreover, 
<A NAME="740"></A>I am not accustomed to think that I deserve any punishment. Had I money 
<A NAME="741"></A>I might have proposed to give you what I had, and have been none the worse. 
<A NAME="742"></A>But you see that I have none, and can only ask you to proportion the fine 
<A NAME="743"></A>to my means. However, I think that I could afford a minae, and therefore 
<A NAME="744"></A>I propose that penalty; Plato, Crito, Critobulus, and Apollodorus, my friends 
<A NAME="745"></A>here, bid me say thirty minae, and they will be the sureties. Well then, 
<A NAME="746"></A>say thirty minae, let that be the penalty; for that they will be ample 
<A NAME="747"></A>security to you.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR><BR><BR><I>The jury condemns Socrates to death.</I>

<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR><B>Socrates' Comments on his Sentence</B>

<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR>Not much time will be gained, O Athenians, in return for the evil 
<A NAME="751"></A>name which you will get from the detractors of the city, who will say that 
<A NAME="752"></A>you killed Socrates, a wise man; for they will call me wise even although 
<A NAME="753"></A>I am not wise when they want to reproach you. If you had waited a little 
<A NAME="754"></A>while, your desire would have been fulfilled in the course of nature. For 
<A NAME="755"></A>I am far advanced in years, as you may perceive, and not far from death. 
<A NAME="756"></A>I am speaking now only to those of you who have condemned me to death. 
<A NAME="757"></A>And I have another thing to say to them: You think that I was convicted 
<A NAME="758"></A>through deficiency of words - I mean, that if I had thought fit to leave 
<A NAME="759"></A>nothing undone, nothing unsaid, I might have gained an acquittal. Not so; 
<A NAME="760"></A>the deficiency which led to my conviction was not of words - certainly 
<A NAME="761"></A>not. But I had not the boldness or impudence or inclination to address 
<A NAME="762"></A>you as you would have liked me to address you, weeping and wailing and 
<A NAME="763"></A>lamenting, and saying and doing many things which you have been accustomed 
<A NAME="764"></A>to hear from others, and which, as I say, are unworthy of me. But I thought 
<A NAME="765"></A>that I ought not to do anything common or mean in the hour of danger: nor 
<A NAME="766"></A>do I now repent of the manner of my defence, and I would rather die having 
<A NAME="767"></A>spoken after my manner, than speak in your manner and live. For neither 
<A NAME="768"></A>in war nor yet at law ought any man to use every way of escaping death. 
<A NAME="769"></A>For often in battle there is no doubt that if a man will throw away his 
<A NAME="770"></A>arms, and fall on his knees before his pursuers, he may escape death; and 
<A NAME="771"></A>in other dangers there are other ways of escaping death, if a man is willing 
<A NAME="772"></A>to say and do anything. The difficulty, my friends, is not in avoiding 
<A NAME="773"></A>death, but in avoiding unrighteousness; for that runs faster than death. 
<A NAME="774"></A>I am old and move slowly, and the slower runner has overtaken me, and my 
<A NAME="775"></A>accusers are keen and quick, and the faster runner, who is unrighteousness, 
<A NAME="776"></A>has overtaken them. And now I depart hence condemned by you to suffer the 
<A NAME="777"></A>penalty of death, and they, too, go their ways condemned by the truth to 
<A NAME="778"></A>suffer the penalty of villainy and wrong; and I must abide by my award 
<A NAME="779"></A>- let them abide by theirs. I suppose that these things may be regarded 
<A NAME="780"></A>as fated, - and I think that they are well.
<A NAME="781"></A><BR><BR>And now, O men who have condemned me, I would fain prophesy to 
<A NAME="782"></A>you; for I am about to die, and that is the hour in which men are gifted 
<A NAME="783"></A>with prophetic power. And I prophesy to you who are my murderers, that 
<A NAME="784"></A>immediately after my death punishment far heavier than you have inflicted 
<A NAME="785"></A>on me will surely await you. Me you have killed because you wanted to escape 
<A NAME="786"></A>the accuser, and not to give an account of your lives. But that will not 
<A NAME="787"></A>be as you suppose: far otherwise. For I say that there will be more accusers 
<A NAME="788"></A>of you than there are now; accusers whom hitherto I have restrained: and 
<A NAME="789"></A>as they are younger they will be more severe with you, and you will be 
<A NAME="790"></A>more offended at them. For if you think that by killing men you can avoid 
<A NAME="791"></A>the accuser censuring your lives, you are mistaken; that is not a way of 
<A NAME="792"></A>escape which is either possible or honorable; the easiest and noblest way 
<A NAME="793"></A>is not to be crushing others, but to be improving yourselves. This is the 
<A NAME="794"></A>prophecy which I utter before my departure, to the judges who have condemned 
<A NAME="795"></A>me.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR><BR>Friends, who would have acquitted me, I would like also to talk 
<A NAME="797"></A>with you about this thing which has happened, while the magistrates are 
<A NAME="798"></A>busy, and before I go to the place at which I must die. Stay then awhile, 
<A NAME="799"></A>for we may as well talk with one another while there is time. You are my 
<A NAME="800"></A>friends, and I should like to show you the meaning of this event which 
<A NAME="801"></A>has happened to me. O my judges - for you I may truly call judges - I should 
<A NAME="802"></A>like to tell you of a wonderful circumstance. Hitherto the familiar oracle 
<A NAME="803"></A>within me has constantly been in the habit of opposing me even about trifles, 
<A NAME="804"></A>if I was going to make a slip or error about anything; and now as you see 
<A NAME="805"></A>there has come upon me that which may be thought, and is generally believed 
<A NAME="806"></A>to be, the last and worst evil. But the oracle made no sign of opposition, 
<A NAME="807"></A>either as I was leaving my house and going out in the morning, or when 
<A NAME="808"></A>I was going up into this court, or while I was speaking, at anything which 
<A NAME="809"></A>I was going to say; and yet I have often been stopped in the middle of 
<A NAME="810"></A>a speech; but now in nothing I either said or did touching this matter 
<A NAME="811"></A>has the oracle opposed me. What do I take to be the explanation of this? 
<A NAME="812"></A>I will tell you. I regard this as a proof that what has happened to me 
<A NAME="813"></A>is a good, and that those of us who think that death is an evil are in 
<A NAME="814"></A>error. This is a great proof to me of what I am saying, for the customary 
<A NAME="815"></A>sign would surely have opposed me had I been going to evil and not to 
<A NAME="816"></A>good.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR>Let us reflect in another way, and we shall see that there is great 
<A NAME="818"></A>reason to hope that death is a good, for one of two things: - either death 
<A NAME="819"></A>is a state of nothingness and utter unconsciousness, or, as men say, there 
<A NAME="820"></A>is a change and migration of the soul from this world to another. Now if 
<A NAME="821"></A>you suppose that there is no consciousness, but a sleep like the sleep 
<A NAME="822"></A>of him who is undisturbed even by the sight of dreams, death will be an 
<A NAME="823"></A>unspeakable gain. For if a person were to select the night in which his 
<A NAME="824"></A>sleep was undisturbed even by dreams, and were to compare with this the 
<A NAME="825"></A>other days and nights of his life, and then were to tell us how many days 
<A NAME="826"></A>and nights he had passed in the course of his life better and more pleasantly 
<A NAME="827"></A>than this one, I think that any man, I will not say a private man, but 
<A NAME="828"></A>even the great king, will not find many such days or nights, when compared 
<A NAME="829"></A>with the others. Now if death is like this, I say that to die is gain; 
<A NAME="830"></A>for eternity is then only a single night. But if death is the journey to 
<A NAME="831"></A>another place, and there, as men say, all the dead are, what good, O my 
<A NAME="832"></A>friends and judges, can be greater than this? If indeed when the pilgrim 
<A NAME="833"></A>arrives in the world below, he is delivered from the professors of justice 
<A NAME="834"></A>in this world, and finds the true judges who are said to give judgment 
<A NAME="835"></A>there, Minos and Rhadamanthus and Aeacus and Triptolemus, and other sons 
<A NAME="836"></A>of God who were righteous in their own life, that pilgrimage will be worth 
<A NAME="837"></A>making. What would not a man give if he might converse with Orpheus and 
<A NAME="838"></A>Musaeus and Hesiod and Homer? Nay, if this be true, let me die again and 
<A NAME="839"></A>again. I, too, shall have a wonderful interest in a place where I can converse 
<A NAME="840"></A>with Palamedes, and Ajax the son of Telamon, and other heroes of old, who 
<A NAME="841"></A>have suffered death through an unjust judgment; and there will be no small 
<A NAME="842"></A>pleasure, as I think, in comparing my own sufferings with theirs. Above 
<A NAME="843"></A>all, I shall be able to continue my search into true and false knowledge; 
<A NAME="844"></A>as in this world, so also in that; I shall find out who is wise, and who 
<A NAME="845"></A>pretends to be wise, and is not. What would not a man give, O judges, to 
<A NAME="846"></A>be able to examine the leader of the great Trojan expedition; or Odysseus 
<A NAME="847"></A>or Sisyphus, or numberless others, men and women too! What infinite delight 
<A NAME="848"></A>would there be in conversing with them and asking them questions! For in 
<A NAME="849"></A>that world they do not put a man to death for this; certainly not. For 
<A NAME="850"></A>besides being happier in that world than in this, they will be immortal, 
<A NAME="851"></A>if what is said is true.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR>Wherefore, O judges, be of good cheer about death, and know this 
<A NAME="853"></A>of a truth - that no evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after 
<A NAME="854"></A>death. He and his are not neglected by the gods; nor has my own approaching 
<A NAME="855"></A>end happened by mere chance. But I see clearly that to die and be released 
<A NAME="856"></A>was better for me; and therefore the oracle gave no sign. For which reason 
<A NAME="857"></A>also, I am not angry with my accusers, or my condemners; they have done 
<A NAME="858"></A>me no harm, although neither of them meant to do me any good; and for this 
<A NAME="859"></A>I may gently blame them.
<A NAME="860"></A><BR><BR>Still I have a favor to ask of them. When my sons are grown up, 
<A NAME="861"></A>I would ask you, O my friends, to punish them; and I would have you trouble 
<A NAME="862"></A>them, as I have troubled you, if they seem to care about riches, or anything, 
<A NAME="863"></A>more than about virtue; or if they pretend to be something when they are 
<A NAME="864"></A>really nothing, - then reprove them, as I have reproved you, for not caring 
<A NAME="865"></A>about that for which they ought to care, and thinking that they are something 
<A NAME="866"></A>when they are really nothing. And if you do this, I and my sons will have 
<A NAME="867"></A>received justice at your hands.
<A NAME="868"></A><BR><BR>The hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways - I to die, 
<A NAME="869"></A>and you to live. Which is better God only knows.
