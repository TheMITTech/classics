<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>Yesterday evening I returned from the army at Potidaea, and having 
<A NAME="18"></A>been a good while away, I thought that I should like to go and look at 
<A NAME="19"></A>my old haunts. So I went into the palaestra of Taureas, which is over against 
<A NAME="20"></A>the temple adjoining the porch of the King Archon, and there I found a 
<A NAME="21"></A>number of persons, most of whom I knew, but not all. My visit was unexpected, 
<A NAME="22"></A>and no sooner did they see me entering than they saluted me from afar on 
<A NAME="23"></A>all sides; and Chaerephon, who is a kind of madman, started up and ran 
<A NAME="24"></A>to me, seizing my hand, and saying, How did you escape, Socrates?-(I should 
<A NAME="25"></A>explain that an engagement had taken place at Potidaea not long before 
<A NAME="26"></A>we came away, of which the news had only just reached 
<A NAME="27"></A>Athens.)
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>You see, I replied, that here I am.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>There was a report, he said, that the engagement was very severe, and 
<A NAME="30"></A>that many of our acquaintance had fallen.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>That, I replied, was not far from the truth.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>I suppose, he said, that you were present.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>I was.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Then sit down, and tell us the whole story, which as yet we have only 
<A NAME="35"></A>heard imperfectly.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>I took the place which he assigned to me, by the side of Critias 
<A NAME="37"></A>the son of Callaeschrus, and when I had saluted him and the rest of the 
<A NAME="38"></A>company, I told them the news from the army, and answered their several 
<A NAME="39"></A>enquiries.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>Then, when there had been enough of this, I, in my turn, began 
<A NAME="41"></A>to make enquiries about matters at home-about the present state of philosophy, 
<A NAME="42"></A>and about the youth. I asked whether any of them were remarkable for wisdom 
<A NAME="43"></A>or beauty, or both. Critias, glancing at the door, invited my attention 
<A NAME="44"></A>to some youths who were coming in, and talking noisily to one another, 
<A NAME="45"></A>followed by a crowd. Of the beauties, Socrates, he said, I fancy that you 
<A NAME="46"></A>will soon be able to form a judgment. For those who are just entering are 
<A NAME="47"></A>the advanced guard of the great beauty, as he is thought to be, of the 
<A NAME="48"></A>day, and he is likely to be not far off himself.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>Who is he, I said; and who is his father?
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Charmides, he replied, is his name; he is my cousin, and the son of 
<A NAME="51"></A>my uncle Glaucon: I rather think that you know him too, although he was 
<A NAME="52"></A>not grown up at the time of your departure.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, I know him, I said, for he was remarkable even then 
<A NAME="54"></A>when he was still a child, and I should imagine that by this time he must 
<A NAME="55"></A>be almost a young man.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>You will see, he said, in a moment what progress he has made and 
<A NAME="57"></A>what he is like. He had scarcely said the word, when Charmides 
<A NAME="58"></A>entered.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>Now you know, my friend, that I cannot measure anything, and of 
<A NAME="60"></A>the beautiful, I am simply such a measure as a white line is of chalk; 
<A NAME="61"></A>for almost all young persons appear to be beautiful in my eyes. But at 
<A NAME="62"></A>that moment, when I saw him coming in, I confess that I was quite astonished 
<A NAME="63"></A>at his beauty and stature; all the world seemed to be enamoured of him; 
<A NAME="64"></A>amazement and confusion reigned when he entered; and a troop of lovers 
<A NAME="65"></A>followed him. That grown-up men like ourselves should have been affected 
<A NAME="66"></A>in this way was not surprising, but I observed that there was the same 
<A NAME="67"></A>feeling among the boys; all of them, down to the very least child, turned 
<A NAME="68"></A>and looked at him, as if he had been a statue.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>Chaerephon called me and said: What do you think of him, Socrates? 
<A NAME="70"></A>Has he not a beautiful face?
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Most beautiful, I said.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>But you would think nothing of his face, he replied, if you could see 
<A NAME="73"></A>his naked form: he is absolutely perfect.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>And to this they all agreed.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>By Heracles, I said, there never was such a paragon, if he has only 
<A NAME="76"></A>one other slight addition.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>What is that? said Critias.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>If he has a noble soul; and being of your house, Critias, he may be 
<A NAME="79"></A>expected to have this.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>He is as fair and good within, as he is without, replied 
<A NAME="81"></A>Critias.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Then, before we see his body, should we not ask him to show us his 
<A NAME="83"></A>soul, naked and undisguised? he is just of an age at which he will like 
<A NAME="84"></A>to talk.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>That he will, said Critias, and I can tell you that he is a philosopher 
<A NAME="86"></A>already, and also a considerable poet, not in his own opinion only, but 
<A NAME="87"></A>in that of others.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>That, my dear Critias, I replied, is a distinction which has long 
<A NAME="89"></A>been in your family, and is inherited by you from Solon. But why do you 
<A NAME="90"></A>not call him, and show him to us? for even if he were younger than he is, 
<A NAME="91"></A>there could be no impropriety in his talking to us in the presence of you, 
<A NAME="92"></A>who are his guardian and cousin.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>Very well, he said; then I will call him; and turning to the attendant, 
<A NAME="94"></A>he said, Call Charmides, and tell him that I want him to come and see a 
<A NAME="95"></A>physician about the illness of which he spoke to me the day before yesterday. 
<A NAME="96"></A>Then again addressing me, he added: He has been complaining lately of having 
<A NAME="97"></A>a headache when he rises in the morning: now why should you not make him 
<A NAME="98"></A>believe that you know a cure for the headache?
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>Why not, I said; but will he come?
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>He will be sure to come, he replied.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>He came as he was bidden, and sat down between Critias and me. Great 
<A NAME="102"></A>amusement was occasioned by every one pushing with might and main at his 
<A NAME="103"></A>neighbour in order to make a place for him next to themselves, until at 
<A NAME="104"></A>the two ends of the row one had to get up and the other was rolled over 
<A NAME="105"></A>sideways. Now my friend, was beginning to feel awkward; former bold belief 
<A NAME="106"></A>in my powers of conversing with him had vanished. And when Critias told 
<A NAME="107"></A>him that I was the person who had the cure, he looked at me in such an 
<A NAME="108"></A>indescribable manner, and was just going to ask a question. And at that 
<A NAME="109"></A>moment all the people in the palaestra crowded about us, and, O rare! I 
<A NAME="110"></A>caught a sight of the inwards of his garment, and took the flame. Then 
<A NAME="111"></A>I could no longer contain myself. I thought how well Cydias understood 
<A NAME="112"></A>the nature of love, when, in speaking of a fair youth, he warns some one 
<A NAME="113"></A>"not to bring the fawn in the sight of the lion to be devoured by him," 
<A NAME="114"></A>for I felt that I had been overcome by a sort of wild-beast appetite. But 
<A NAME="115"></A>I controlled myself, and when he asked me if I knew the cure of the headache, 
<A NAME="116"></A>I answered, but with an effort, that I did know.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>And what is it? he said.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>I replied that it was a kind of leaf, which required to be accompanied 
<A NAME="119"></A>by a charm, and if a person would repeat the charm at the same time that 
<A NAME="120"></A>he used the cure, he would be made whole; but that without the charm the 
<A NAME="121"></A>leaf would be of no avail.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>Then I will write out the charm from your dictation, he 
<A NAME="123"></A>said.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>With my consent? I said, or without my consent?
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>With your consent, Socrates, he said, laughing.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Very good, I said; and are you quite sure that you know my 
<A NAME="127"></A>name?
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>I ought to know you, he replied, for there is a great deal said about 
<A NAME="129"></A>you among my companions; and I remember when I was a child seeing you in 
<A NAME="130"></A>company with my cousin Critias.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>I am glad to find that you remember me, I said; for I shall now 
<A NAME="132"></A>be more at home with you and shall be better able to explain the nature 
<A NAME="133"></A>of the charm, about which I felt a difficulty before. For the charm will 
<A NAME="134"></A>do more, Charmides, than only cure the headache. I dare say that you have 
<A NAME="135"></A>heard eminent physicians say to a patient who comes to them with bad eyes, 
<A NAME="136"></A>that they cannot cure his eyes by themselves, but that if his eyes are 
<A NAME="137"></A>to be cured, his head must be treated; and then again they say that to 
<A NAME="138"></A>think of curing the head alone, and not the rest of the body also, is the 
<A NAME="139"></A>height of folly. And arguing in this way they apply their methods to the 
<A NAME="140"></A>whole body, and try to treat and heal the whole and the part together. 
<A NAME="141"></A>Did you ever observe that this is what they say?
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>And they are right, and you would agree with them?
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Yes, he said, certainly I should.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>His approving answers reassured me, and I began by degrees to regain 
<A NAME="146"></A>confidence, and the vital heat returned. Such, Charmides, I said, is the 
<A NAME="147"></A>nature of the charm, which I learned when serving with the army from one 
<A NAME="148"></A>of the physicians of the Thracian king Zamolxis, who are to be so skilful 
<A NAME="149"></A>that they can even give immortality. This Thracian told me that in these 
<A NAME="150"></A>notions of theirs, which I was just now mentioning, the Greek physicians 
<A NAME="151"></A>are quite right as far as they go; but Zamolxis, he added, our king, who 
<A NAME="152"></A>is also a god, says further, "that as you ought not to attempt to cure 
<A NAME="153"></A>the eyes without the head, or the head without the body, so neither ought 
<A NAME="154"></A>you to attempt to cure the body without the soul; and this," he said, "is 
<A NAME="155"></A>the reason why the cure of many diseases is unknown to the physicians of 
<A NAME="156"></A>Hellas, because they are ignorant of the whole, which ought to be studied 
<A NAME="157"></A>also; for the part can never be well unless the whole is well." For all 
<A NAME="158"></A>good and evil, whether in the body or in human nature, originates, as he 
<A NAME="159"></A>declared, in the soul, and overflows from thence, as if from the head into 
<A NAME="160"></A>the eyes. And therefore if the head and body are to be well, you must begin 
<A NAME="161"></A>by curing the soul; that is the first thing. And the cure, my dear youth, 
<A NAME="162"></A>has to be effected by the use of certain charms, and these charms are fair 
<A NAME="163"></A>words; and by them temperance is implanted in the soul, and where temperance 
<A NAME="164"></A>is, there health is speedily imparted, not only to the head, but to the 
<A NAME="165"></A>whole body. And he who taught me the cure and the charm at the same time 
<A NAME="166"></A>added a special direction: "Let no one," he said, "persuade you to cure 
<A NAME="167"></A>the head, until he has first given you his soul to be cured by the charm. 
<A NAME="168"></A>For this," he said, "is the great error of our day in the treatment of 
<A NAME="169"></A>the human body, that physicians separate the soul from the body." And he 
<A NAME="170"></A>added with emphasis, at the same time making me swear to his words, "Let 
<A NAME="171"></A>no one, however rich, or noble, or fair, persuade you to give him the cure, 
<A NAME="172"></A>without the charm." Now I have sworn, and I must keep my oath, and therefore 
<A NAME="173"></A>if you will allow me to apply the Thracian charm first to your soul, as 
<A NAME="174"></A>the stranger directed, I will afterwards proceed to apply the cure to your 
<A NAME="175"></A>head. But if not, I do not know what I am to do with you, my dear 
<A NAME="176"></A>Charmides.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>Critias, when he heard this, said: The headache will be an unexpected 
<A NAME="178"></A>gain to my young relation, if the pain in his head compels him to improve 
<A NAME="179"></A>his mind: and I can tell you, Socrates, that Charmides is not only pre-eminent 
<A NAME="180"></A>in beauty among his equals, but also in that quality which is given by 
<A NAME="181"></A>the charm; and this, as you say, is temperance?
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Then let me tell you that he is the most temperate of human beings, 
<A NAME="184"></A>and for his age inferior to none in any quality.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said, Charmides; and indeed I think that you ought to excel 
<A NAME="186"></A>others in all good qualities; for if I am not mistaken there is no one 
<A NAME="187"></A>present who could easily point out two Athenian houses, whose union would 
<A NAME="188"></A>be likely to produce a better or nobler scion than the two from which you 
<A NAME="189"></A>are sprung. There is your father's house, which is descended from Critias 
<A NAME="190"></A>the son of Dropidas, whose family has been commemorated in the panegyrical 
<A NAME="191"></A>verses of Anacreon, Solon, and many other poets, as famous for beauty and 
<A NAME="192"></A>virtue and all other high fortune: and your mother's house is equally distinguished; 
<A NAME="193"></A>for your maternal uncle, Pyrilampes, is reputed never to have found his 
<A NAME="194"></A>equal, in Persia at the court of the great king, or on the continent of 
<A NAME="195"></A>Asia, in all the places to which he went as ambassador, for stature and 
<A NAME="196"></A>beauty; that whole family is not a whit inferior to the other. Having such 
<A NAME="197"></A>ancestors you ought to be first in all things, and, sweet son of Glaucon, 
<A NAME="198"></A>your outward form is no dishonour to any of them. If to beauty you add 
<A NAME="199"></A>temperance, and if in other respects you are what Critias declares you 
<A NAME="200"></A>to be, then, dear Charmides, blessed art thou, in being the son of thy 
<A NAME="201"></A>mother. And here lies the point; for if, as he declares, you have this 
<A NAME="202"></A>gift of temperance already, and are temperate enough, in that case you 
<A NAME="203"></A>have no need of any charms, whether of Zamolxis or of Abaris the Hyperborean, 
<A NAME="204"></A>and I may as well let you have the cure of the head at once; but if you 
<A NAME="205"></A>have not yet acquired this quality, I must use the charm before I give 
<A NAME="206"></A>you the medicine. Please, therefore, to inform me whether you admit the 
<A NAME="207"></A>truth of what Critias has been saying;-have you or have you not this quality 
<A NAME="208"></A>of temperance?
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>Charmides blushed, and the blush heightened his beauty, for modesty 
<A NAME="210"></A>is becoming in youth; he then said very ingenuously, that he really could 
<A NAME="211"></A>not at once answer, either yes, or no, to the question which I had asked: 
<A NAME="212"></A>For, said he, if I affirm that I am not temperate, that would be a strange 
<A NAME="213"></A>thing for me to say of myself, and also I should give the lie to Critias, 
<A NAME="214"></A>and many others who think as he tells you, that I am temperate: but, on 
<A NAME="215"></A>the other hand, if I say that I am, I shall have to praise myself, which 
<A NAME="216"></A>would be ill manners; and therefore I do not know how to answer 
<A NAME="217"></A>you.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>I said to him: That is a natural reply, Charmides, and I think 
<A NAME="219"></A>that you and I ought together to enquire whether you have this quality 
<A NAME="220"></A>about which I am asking or not; and then you will not be compelled to say 
<A NAME="221"></A>what you do not like; neither shall I be a rash practitioner of medicine: 
<A NAME="222"></A>therefore, if you please, I will share the enquiry with you, but I will 
<A NAME="223"></A>not press you if you would rather not.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>There is nothing which I should like better, he said; and as far 
<A NAME="225"></A>as I am concerned you may proceed in the way which you think 
<A NAME="226"></A>best.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>I think, I said, that I had better begin by asking you a question; 
<A NAME="228"></A>for if temperance abides in you, you must have an opinion about her; she 
<A NAME="229"></A>must give some intimation of her nature and qualities, which may enable 
<A NAME="230"></A>you to form a notion of her. Is not that true?
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that I think is true.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>You know your native language, I said, and therefore you must be able 
<A NAME="233"></A>to tell what you feel about this.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>In order, then, that I may form a conjecture whether you have temperance 
<A NAME="236"></A>abiding in you or not, tell me, I said, what, in your opinion, is 
<A NAME="237"></A>Temperance?
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>At first he hesitated, and was very unwilling to answer: then he 
<A NAME="239"></A>said that he thought temperance was doing things orderly and quietly, such 
<A NAME="240"></A>things for example as walking in the streets, and talking, or anything 
<A NAME="241"></A>else of that nature. In a word, he said, I should answer that, in my opinion, 
<A NAME="242"></A>temperance is quietness.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>Are you right, Charmides? I said. No doubt some would affirm that 
<A NAME="244"></A>the quiet are the temperate; but let us see whether these words have any 
<A NAME="245"></A>meaning; and first tell me whether you would not acknowledge temperance 
<A NAME="246"></A>to be of the class of the noble and good?
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>But which is best when you are at the writing-master's, to write the 
<A NAME="249"></A>same letters quickly or quietly?
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>Quickly.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>And to read quickly or slowly?
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Quickly again.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>And in playing the lyre, or wrestling, quickness or sharpness are far 
<A NAME="254"></A>better than quietness and slowness?
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>And the same holds in boxing and in the pancratium?
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>And in leaping and running and in bodily exercises generally, quickness 
<A NAME="259"></A>and agility are good; slowness, and inactivity, and quietness, are 
<A NAME="260"></A>bad?
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>That is evident.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Then, I said, in all bodily actions, not quietness, but the greatest 
<A NAME="263"></A>agility and quickness, is noblest and best?
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>Yes, certainly.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>And is temperance a good?
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Then, in reference to the body, not quietness, but quickness will be 
<A NAME="268"></A>the higher degree of temperance, if temperance is a 
<A NAME="269"></A>good?
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>And which, I said, is better-facility in learning, or difficulty in 
<A NAME="272"></A>learning?
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>Facility.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Yes, I said; and facility in learning is learning quickly, and difficulty 
<A NAME="275"></A>in learning is learning quietly and slowly?
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>And is it not better to teach another quickly and energetically, rather 
<A NAME="278"></A>than quietly and slowly?
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>And which is better, to call to mind, and to remember, quickly and 
<A NAME="281"></A>readily, or quietly and slowly?
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>The former.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>And is not shrewdness a quickness or cleverness of the soul, and not 
<A NAME="284"></A>a quietness?
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>And is it not best to understand what is said, whether at the writing-master's 
<A NAME="287"></A>or the music-master's, or anywhere else, not as quietly as possible, but 
<A NAME="288"></A>as quickly as possible?
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>And in the searchings or deliberations of the soul, not the quietest, 
<A NAME="291"></A>as I imagine, and he who with difficulty deliberates and discovers, is 
<A NAME="292"></A>thought worthy of praise, but he who does so most easily and 
<A NAME="293"></A>quickly?
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>Quite true, he said.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>And in all that concerns either body or soul, swiftness and activity 
<A NAME="296"></A>are clearly better than slowness and quietness?
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>Clearly they are.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Then temperance is not quietness, nor is the temperate life quiet,-certainly 
<A NAME="299"></A>not upon this view; for the life which is temperate is supposed to be the 
<A NAME="300"></A>good. And of two things, one is true, either never, or very seldom, do 
<A NAME="301"></A>the quiet actions in life appear to be better than the quick and energetic 
<A NAME="302"></A>ones; or supposing that of the nobler actions, there are as many quiet, 
<A NAME="303"></A>as quick and vehement: still, even if we grant this, temperance will not 
<A NAME="304"></A>be acting quietly any more than acting quickly and energetically, either 
<A NAME="305"></A>in walking or talking or in anything else; nor will the quiet life be more 
<A NAME="306"></A>temperate than the unquiet, seeing that temperance is admitted by us to 
<A NAME="307"></A>be a good and noble thing, and the quick have been shown to be as good 
<A NAME="308"></A>as the quiet.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>I think, he said, Socrates, that you are right.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Then once more, Charmides, I said, fix your attention, and look within; 
<A NAME="311"></A>consider the effect which temperance has upon yourself, and the nature 
<A NAME="312"></A>of that which has the effect. Think over all this, and, like a brave youth, 
<A NAME="313"></A>tell me-What is temperance?
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>After a moment's pause, in which he made a real manly effort to 
<A NAME="315"></A>think, he said: My opinion is, Socrates, that temperance makes a man ashamed 
<A NAME="316"></A>or modest, and that temperance is the same as modesty.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>Very good, I said; and did you not admit, just now, that temperance 
<A NAME="318"></A>is noble?
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>Yes, certainly, he said.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>And the temperate are also good?
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>And can that be good which does not make men good?
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>And you would infer that temperance is not only noble, but also 
<A NAME="325"></A>good?
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>That is my opinion.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Well, I said; but surely you would agree with Homer when he 
<A NAME="328"></A>says,
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>Modesty is not good for a needy man?
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; I agree.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Then I suppose that modesty is and is not good?
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>But temperance, whose presence makes men only good, and not bad, is 
<A NAME="334"></A>always good?
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>That appears to me to be as you say.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>And the inference is that temperance cannot be modesty-if temperance 
<A NAME="337"></A>is a good, and if modesty is as much an evil as a good?
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>All that, Socrates, appears to me to be true; but I should like 
<A NAME="339"></A>to know what you think about another definition of temperance, which I 
<A NAME="340"></A>just now remember to have heard from some one, who said, "That temperance 
<A NAME="341"></A>is doing our own business." Was he right who affirmed 
<A NAME="342"></A>that?
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>You monster! I said; this is what Critias, or some philosopher 
<A NAME="344"></A>has told you.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>Some one else, then, said Critias; for certainly I have 
<A NAME="346"></A>not.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>But what matter, said Charmides, from whom I heard 
<A NAME="348"></A>this?
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>No matter at all, I replied; for the point is not who said the words, 
<A NAME="350"></A>but whether they are true or not.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>There you are in the right, Socrates, he replied.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>To be sure, I said; yet I doubt whether we shall ever be able to discover 
<A NAME="353"></A>their truth or falsehood; for they are a kind of riddle.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>What makes you think so? he said.
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Because, I said, he who uttered them seems to me to have meant one 
<A NAME="356"></A>thing, and said another. Is the scribe, for example, to be regarded as 
<A NAME="357"></A>doing nothing when he reads or writes?
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>I should rather think that he was doing something.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>And does the scribe write or read, or teach you boys to write or read, 
<A NAME="360"></A>your own names only, or did you write your enemies' names as well as your 
<A NAME="361"></A>own and your friends'?
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>As much one as the other.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>And was there anything meddling or intemperate in 
<A NAME="364"></A>this?
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>And yet if reading and writing are the same as doing, you were doing 
<A NAME="367"></A>what was not your own business?
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>But they are the same as doing.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>And the healing art, my friend, and building, and weaving, and doing 
<A NAME="370"></A>anything whatever which is done by art,-these all clearly come under the 
<A NAME="371"></A>head of doing?
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>And do you think that a state would be well ordered by a law which 
<A NAME="374"></A>compelled every man to weave and wash his own coat, and make his own shoes, 
<A NAME="375"></A>and his own flask and strigil, and other implements, on this principle 
<A NAME="376"></A>of every one doing and performing his own, and abstaining from what is 
<A NAME="377"></A>not his own?
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>I think not, he said.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>But, I said, a temperate state will be a well ordered 
<A NAME="380"></A>state.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Of course, he replied.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Then temperance, I said, will not be doing one's own business; not 
<A NAME="383"></A>at least in this way, or doing things of this sort?
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>Clearly not.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Then, as I was just now saying, he who declared that temperance is 
<A NAME="386"></A>a man doing his own business had another and a hidden meaning; for I do 
<A NAME="387"></A>not think that he could have been such a fool as to mean this. Was he a 
<A NAME="388"></A>fool who told you, Charmides?
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>Nay, he replied, I certainly thought him a very wise 
<A NAME="390"></A>man.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>Then I am quite certain that he put forth his definition as a riddle, 
<A NAME="392"></A>thinking that no one would know the meaning of the words "doing his own 
<A NAME="393"></A>business."
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>I dare say, he replied.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>And what is the meaning of a man doing his own business? Can you tell 
<A NAME="396"></A>me?
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, I cannot; and I should not wonder if the man himself who 
<A NAME="398"></A>used this phrase did not understand what he was saying. Whereupon he laughed 
<A NAME="399"></A>slyly, and looked at Critias.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>Critias had long been showing uneasiness, for he felt that he had 
<A NAME="401"></A>a reputation to maintain with Charmides and the rest of the company. He 
<A NAME="402"></A>had, however, hitherto managed to restrain himself; but now he could no 
<A NAME="403"></A>longer forbear, and I am convinced of the truth of the suspicion which 
<A NAME="404"></A>I entertained at the time, that Charmides had heard this answer about temperance 
<A NAME="405"></A>from Critias. And Charmides, who did not want to answer himself, but to 
<A NAME="406"></A>make Critias answer, tried to stir him up. He went on pointing out that 
<A NAME="407"></A>he had been refuted, at which Critias grew angry, and appeared, as I thought, 
<A NAME="408"></A>inclined to quarrel with him; just as a poet might quarrel with an actor 
<A NAME="409"></A>who spoiled his poems in repeating them; so he looked hard at him and 
<A NAME="410"></A>said--
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>Do you imagine, Charmides, that the author of this definition of 
<A NAME="412"></A>temperance did not understand the meaning of his own words, because you 
<A NAME="413"></A>do not understand them?
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>Why, at his age, I said, most excellent Critias, he can hardly 
<A NAME="415"></A>be expected to understand; but you, who are older, and have studied, may 
<A NAME="416"></A>well be assumed to know the meaning of them; and therefore, if you agree 
<A NAME="417"></A>with him, and accept his definition of temperance, I would much rather 
<A NAME="418"></A>argue with you than with him about the truth or falsehood of the 
<A NAME="419"></A>definition.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>I entirely agree, said Critias, and accept the 
<A NAME="421"></A>definition.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Very good, I said; and now let me repeat my question-Do you admit, 
<A NAME="423"></A>as I was just now saying, that all craftsmen make or do 
<A NAME="424"></A>something?
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>I do.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>And do they make or do their own business only, or that of others 
<A NAME="427"></A>also?
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>They make or do that of others also.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>And are they temperate, seeing that they make not for themselves or 
<A NAME="430"></A>their own business only?
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR>Why not? he said.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>No objection on my part, I said, but there may be a difficulty on his 
<A NAME="433"></A>who proposes as a definition of temperance, "doing one's own business," 
<A NAME="434"></A>and then says that there is no reason why those who do the business of 
<A NAME="435"></A>others should not be temperate.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>Nay, said he; did I ever acknowledge that those who do the business 
<A NAME="437"></A>of others are temperate? I said, those who make, not those who 
<A NAME="438"></A>do.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>What! I asked; do you mean to say that doing and making are not 
<A NAME="440"></A>the same?
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>No more, he replied, than making or working are the same; thus 
<A NAME="442"></A>much I have learned from Hesiod, who says that "work is no disgrace." Now 
<A NAME="443"></A>do you imagine that if he had meant by working and doing such things as 
<A NAME="444"></A>you were describing, he would have said that there was no disgrace in them-for 
<A NAME="445"></A>example, in the manufacture of shoes, or in selling pickles, or sitting 
<A NAME="446"></A>for hire in a house of ill-fame? That, Socrates, is not to be supposed: 
<A NAME="447"></A>but I conceive him to have distinguished making from doing and work; and, 
<A NAME="448"></A>while admitting that the making anything might sometimes become a disgrace, 
<A NAME="449"></A>when the employment was not honourable, to have thought that work was never 
<A NAME="450"></A>any disgrace at all. For things nobly and usefully made he called works; 
<A NAME="451"></A>and such makings he called workings, and doings; and he must be supposed 
<A NAME="452"></A>to have called such things only man's proper business, and what is hurtful, 
<A NAME="453"></A>not his business: and in that sense Hesiod, and any other wise man, may 
<A NAME="454"></A>be reasonably supposed to call him wise who does his own 
<A NAME="455"></A>work.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>O Critias, I said, no sooner had you opened your mouth, than I 
<A NAME="457"></A>pretty well knew that you would call that which is proper to a man, and 
<A NAME="458"></A>that which is his own, good; and that the markings of the good you would 
<A NAME="459"></A>call doings, for I am no stranger to the endless distinctions which Prodicus 
<A NAME="460"></A>draws about names. Now I have no objection to your giving names any signification 
<A NAME="461"></A>which you please, if you will only tell me what you mean by them. Please 
<A NAME="462"></A>then to begin again, and be a little plainer. Do you mean that this doing 
<A NAME="463"></A>or making, or whatever is the word which you would use, of good actions, 
<A NAME="464"></A>is temperance?
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>I do, he said.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>Then not he who does evil, but he who does good, is 
<A NAME="467"></A>temperate?
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Yes, he said; and you, friend, would agree.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>No matter whether I should or not; just now, not what I think, but 
<A NAME="470"></A>what you are saying, is the point at issue.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>Well, he answered; I mean to say, that he who does evil, and not 
<A NAME="472"></A>good, is not temperate; and that he is temperate who does good, and not 
<A NAME="473"></A>evil: for temperance I define in plain words to be the doing of good 
<A NAME="474"></A>actions.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR>And you may be very likely right in what you are saying; but I 
<A NAME="476"></A>am curious to know whether you imagine that temperate men are ignorant 
<A NAME="477"></A>of their own temperance?
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>I do not think so, he said.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>And yet were you not saying, just now, that craftsmen might be temperate 
<A NAME="480"></A>in doing another's work, as well as in doing their own?
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR>I was, he replied; but what is your drift?
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>I have no particular drift, but I wish that you would tell me whether 
<A NAME="483"></A>a physician who cures a patient may do good to himself and good to another 
<A NAME="484"></A>also?
<A NAME="485"></A><BR><BR>I think that he may.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>And he who does so does his duty?
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>And does not he who does his duty act temperately or 
<A NAME="489"></A>wisely?
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Yes, he acts wisely.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>But must the physician necessarily know when his treatment is likely 
<A NAME="492"></A>to prove beneficial, and when not? or must the craftsman necessarily know 
<A NAME="493"></A>when he is likely to be benefited, and when not to be benefited, by the 
<A NAME="494"></A>work which he is doing?
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>I suppose not.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Then, I said, he may sometimes do good or harm, and not know what he 
<A NAME="497"></A>is himself doing, and yet, in doing good, as you say, he has done temperately 
<A NAME="498"></A>or wisely. Was not that your statement?
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Then, as would seem, in doing good, he may act wisely or temperately, 
<A NAME="501"></A>and be wise or temperate, but not know his own wisdom or 
<A NAME="502"></A>temperance?
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR>But that, Socrates, he said, is impossible; and therefore if this 
<A NAME="504"></A>is, as you imply, the necessary consequence of any of my previous admissions, 
<A NAME="505"></A>I will withdraw them, rather than admit that a man can be temperate or 
<A NAME="506"></A>wise who does not know himself; and I am not ashamed to confess that I 
<A NAME="507"></A>was in error. For self-knowledge would certainly be maintained by me to 
<A NAME="508"></A>be the very essence of knowledge, and in this I agree with him who dedicated 
<A NAME="509"></A>the inscription, "Know thyself!" at Delphi. That word, if I am not mistaken, 
<A NAME="510"></A>is put there as a sort of salutation which the god addresses to those who 
<A NAME="511"></A>enter the temple; as much as to say that the ordinary salutation of "Hail!" 
<A NAME="512"></A>is not right, and that the exhortation "Be temperate!" would be a far better 
<A NAME="513"></A>way of saluting one another. The notion of him who dedicated the inscription 
<A NAME="514"></A>was, as I believe, that the god speaks to those who enter his temple, not 
<A NAME="515"></A>as men speak; but, when a worshipper enters, the first word which he hears 
<A NAME="516"></A>is "Be temperate!" This, however, like a prophet he expresses in a sort 
<A NAME="517"></A>of riddle, for "Know thyself!" and "Be temperate!" are the same, as I maintain, 
<A NAME="518"></A>and as the letters imply, and yet they may be easily misunderstood; and 
<A NAME="519"></A>succeeding sages who added "Never too much," or, "Give a pledge, and evil 
<A NAME="520"></A>is nigh at hand," would appear to have so misunderstood them; for they 
<A NAME="521"></A>imagined that "Know thyself!" was a piece of advice which the god gave, 
<A NAME="522"></A>and not his salutation of the worshippers at their first coming in; and 
<A NAME="523"></A>they dedicated their own inscription under the idea that they too would 
<A NAME="524"></A>give equally useful pieces of advice. Shall I tell you, Socrates, why I 
<A NAME="525"></A>say all this? My object is to leave the previous discussion (in which I 
<A NAME="526"></A>know not whether you or I are more right, but, at any rate, no clear result 
<A NAME="527"></A>was attained), and to raise a new one in which I will attempt to prove, 
<A NAME="528"></A>if you deny, that temperance is self-knowledge.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said, Critias; but you come to me as though I professed 
<A NAME="530"></A>to know about the questions which I ask, and as though I could, if I only 
<A NAME="531"></A>would, agree with you. Whereas the fact is that I enquire with you into 
<A NAME="532"></A>the truth of that which is advanced from time to time, just because I do 
<A NAME="533"></A>not know; and when I have enquired, I will say whether I agree with you 
<A NAME="534"></A>or not. Please then to allow me time to reflect.
<A NAME="535"></A><BR><BR>Reflect, he said.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>I am reflecting, I replied, and discover that temperance, or wisdom, 
<A NAME="537"></A>if implying a knowledge of anything, must be a science, and a science of 
<A NAME="538"></A>something.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; the science of itself.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Is not medicine, I said, the science of health?
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>And suppose, I said, that I were asked by you what is the use or effect 
<A NAME="543"></A>of medicine, which is this science of health, I should answer that medicine 
<A NAME="544"></A>is of very great use in producing health, which, as you will admit, is 
<A NAME="545"></A>an excellent effect.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR>Granted.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>And if you were to ask me, what is the result or effect of architecture, 
<A NAME="548"></A>which is the science of building, I should say houses, and so of other 
<A NAME="549"></A>arts, which all have their different results. Now I want you, Critias, 
<A NAME="550"></A>to answer a similar question about temperance, or wisdom, which, according 
<A NAME="551"></A>to you, is the science of itself. Admitting this view, I ask of you, what 
<A NAME="552"></A>good work, worthy of the name wise, does temperance or wisdom, which is 
<A NAME="553"></A>the science of itself, effect? Answer me.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>That is not the true way of pursuing the enquiry, Socrates, he 
<A NAME="555"></A>said; for wisdom is not like the other sciences, any more than they are 
<A NAME="556"></A>like one another: but you proceed as if they were alike. For tell me, he 
<A NAME="557"></A>said, what result is there of computation or geometry, in the same sense 
<A NAME="558"></A>as a house is the result of building, or a garment of weaving, or any other 
<A NAME="559"></A>work of any other art? Can you show me any such result of them? You 
<A NAME="560"></A>cannot.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR>That is true, I said; but still each of these sciences has a subject 
<A NAME="562"></A>which is different from the science. I can show you that the art of computation 
<A NAME="563"></A>has to do with odd and even numbers in their numerical relations to themselves 
<A NAME="564"></A>and to each other. Is not that true?
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>And the odd and even numbers are not the same with the art of 
<A NAME="567"></A>computation?
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>They are not.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>The art of weighing, again, has to do with lighter and heavier; but 
<A NAME="570"></A>the art of weighing is one thing, and the heavy and the light another. 
<A NAME="571"></A>Do you admit that?
<A NAME="572"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Now, I want to know, what is that which is not wisdom, and of which 
<A NAME="574"></A>wisdom is the science?
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR>You are just falling into the old error, Socrates, he said. You 
<A NAME="576"></A>come asking in what wisdom or temperance differs from the other sciences, 
<A NAME="577"></A>and then you try to discover some respect in which they are alike; but 
<A NAME="578"></A>they are not, for all the other sciences are of something else, and not 
<A NAME="579"></A>of themselves; wisdom alone is a science of other sciences, and of itself. 
<A NAME="580"></A>And of this, as I believe, you are very well aware: and that you are only 
<A NAME="581"></A>doing what you denied that you were doing just now, trying to refute me, 
<A NAME="582"></A>instead of pursuing the argument.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR>And what if I am? How can you think that I have any other motive 
<A NAME="584"></A>in refuting you but what I should have in examining into myself? which 
<A NAME="585"></A>motive would be just a fear of my unconsciously fancying that I knew something 
<A NAME="586"></A>of which I was ignorant. And at this moment I pursue the argument chiefly 
<A NAME="587"></A>for my own sake, and perhaps in some degree also for the sake of my other 
<A NAME="588"></A>friends. For is not the discovery of things as they truly are, a good common 
<A NAME="589"></A>to all mankind?
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>Yes, certainly, Socrates, he said.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>Then, I said, be cheerful, sweet sir, and give your opinion in answer 
<A NAME="592"></A>to the question which I asked, never minding whether Critias or Socrates 
<A NAME="593"></A>is the person refuted; attend only to the argument, and see what will come 
<A NAME="594"></A>of the refutation.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>I think that you are right, he replied; and I will do as you 
<A NAME="596"></A>say.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Tell me, then, I said, what you mean to affirm about 
<A NAME="598"></A>wisdom.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>I mean to say that wisdom is the only science which is the science 
<A NAME="600"></A>of itself as well as of the other sciences.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>But the science of science, I said, will also be the science of 
<A NAME="602"></A>the absence of science.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Then the wise or temperate man, and he only, will know himself, and 
<A NAME="605"></A>be able to examine what he knows or does not know, and to see what others 
<A NAME="606"></A>know and think that they know and do really know; and what they do not 
<A NAME="607"></A>know, and fancy that they know, when they do not. No other person will 
<A NAME="608"></A>be able to do this. And this is wisdom and temperance and self-knowledge-for 
<A NAME="609"></A>a man to know what he knows, and what he does not know. That is your 
<A NAME="610"></A>meaning?
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Now then, I said, making an offering of the third or last argument 
<A NAME="613"></A>to Zeus the Saviour, let us begin again, and ask, in the first place, whether 
<A NAME="614"></A>it is or is not possible for a person to know that he knows and does not 
<A NAME="615"></A>know what he knows and does not know; and in the second place, whether, 
<A NAME="616"></A>if perfectly possible, such knowledge is of any use.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR>That is what we have to consider, he said.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>And here, Critias, I said, I hope that you will find a way out of a 
<A NAME="619"></A>difficulty into which I have got myself. Shall I tell you the nature of 
<A NAME="620"></A>the difficulty?
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR>By all means, he replied.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Does not what you have been saying, if true, amount to this: that there 
<A NAME="623"></A>must be a single science which is wholly a science of itself and of other 
<A NAME="624"></A>sciences, and that the same is also the science of the absence of 
<A NAME="625"></A>science?
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>But consider how monstrous this proposition is, my friend: in any parallel 
<A NAME="628"></A>case, the impossibility will be transparent to you.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>How is that? and in what cases do you mean?
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>In such cases as this: Suppose that there is a kind of vision which 
<A NAME="631"></A>is not like ordinary vision, but a vision of itself and of other sorts 
<A NAME="632"></A>of vision, and of the defect of them, which in seeing sees no colour, but 
<A NAME="633"></A>only itself and other sorts of vision: Do you think that there is such 
<A NAME="634"></A>a kind of vision?
<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Or is there a kind of hearing which hears no sound at all, but only 
<A NAME="637"></A>itself and other sorts of hearing, or the defects of 
<A NAME="638"></A>them?
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>There is not.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Or take all the senses: can you imagine that there is any sense of 
<A NAME="641"></A>itself and of other senses, but which is incapable of perceiving the objects 
<A NAME="642"></A>of the senses?
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR>I think not.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Could there be any desire which is not the desire of any pleasure, 
<A NAME="645"></A>but of itself, and of all other desires?
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Or can you imagine a wish which wishes for no good, but only for itself 
<A NAME="648"></A>and all other wishes?
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>I should answer, No.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Or would you say that there is a love which is not the love of beauty, 
<A NAME="651"></A>but of itself and of other loves?
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>I should not.
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Or did you ever know of a fear which fears itself or other fears, but 
<A NAME="654"></A>has no object of fear?
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>I never did, he said.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Or of an opinion which is an opinion of itself and of other opinions, 
<A NAME="657"></A>and which has no opinion on the subjects of opinion in 
<A NAME="658"></A>general?
<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>But surely we are assuming a science of this kind, which, having no 
<A NAME="661"></A>subject-matter, is a science of itself and of the other 
<A NAME="662"></A>sciences?
<A NAME="663"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that is what is affirmed.
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>But how strange is this, if it be indeed true: must not however as 
<A NAME="665"></A>yet absolutely deny the possibility of such a science; let us rather consider 
<A NAME="666"></A>the matter.
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>You are quite right.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>Well then, this science of which we are speaking is a science of something, 
<A NAME="669"></A>and is of a nature to be a science of something?
<A NAME="670"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Just as that which is greater is of a nature to be greater than something 
<A NAME="672"></A>else?
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>Which is less, if the other is conceived to be greater?
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>To be sure.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>And if we could find something which is at once greater than itself, 
<A NAME="677"></A>and greater than other great things, but not greater than those things 
<A NAME="678"></A>in comparison of which the others are greater, then that thing would have 
<A NAME="679"></A>the property of being greater and also less than itself?
<A NAME="680"></A><BR><BR>That, Socrates, he said, is the inevitable inference.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Or if there be a double which is double of itself and of other doubles, 
<A NAME="682"></A>these will be halves; for the double is relative to the 
<A NAME="683"></A>half?
<A NAME="684"></A><BR><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>And that which is greater than itself will also be less, and that which 
<A NAME="686"></A>is heavier will also be lighter, and that which is older will also be younger: 
<A NAME="687"></A>and the same of other things; that which has a nature relative to self 
<A NAME="688"></A>will retain also the nature of its object: I mean to say, for example, 
<A NAME="689"></A>that hearing is, as we say, of sound or voice. Is that 
<A NAME="690"></A>true?
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>Then if hearing hears itself, it must hear a voice; for there is no 
<A NAME="693"></A>other way of hearing.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>And sight also, my excellent friend, if it sees itself must see a colour, 
<A NAME="696"></A>for sight cannot see that which has no colour.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR>No.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>Do you remark, Critias, that in several of the examples which have 
<A NAME="699"></A>been recited the notion of a relation to self is altogether inadmissible, 
<A NAME="700"></A>and in other cases hardly credible-inadmissible, for example, in the case 
<A NAME="701"></A>of magnitudes, numbers, and the like?
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>But in the case of hearing and sight, or in the power of self-motion, 
<A NAME="704"></A>and the power of heat to burn, this relation to self will be regarded as 
<A NAME="705"></A>incredible by some, but perhaps not by others. And some great man, my friend, 
<A NAME="706"></A>is wanted, who will satisfactorily determine for us, whether there is nothing 
<A NAME="707"></A>which has an inherent property of relation to self, or some things only 
<A NAME="708"></A>and not others; and whether in this class of self-related things, if there 
<A NAME="709"></A>be such a class, that science which is called wisdom or temperance is included. 
<A NAME="710"></A>I altogether distrust my own power of determining these matters: I am not 
<A NAME="711"></A>certain whether there is such a science of science at all; and even if 
<A NAME="712"></A>there be, I should not acknowledge this to be wisdom or temperance, until 
<A NAME="713"></A>I can also see whether such a science would or would not do us any good; 
<A NAME="714"></A>for I have an impression that temperance is a benefit and a good. And therefore, 
<A NAME="715"></A>O son of Callaeschrus, as you maintain that temperance or wisdom is a science 
<A NAME="716"></A>of science, and also of the absence of science, I will request you to show 
<A NAME="717"></A>in the first place, as I was saying before, the possibility, and in the 
<A NAME="718"></A>second place, the advantage, of such a science; and then perhaps you may 
<A NAME="719"></A>satisfy me that you are right in your view of temperance.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR>Critias heard me say this, and saw that I was in a difficulty; 
<A NAME="721"></A>and as one person when another yawns in his presence catches the infection 
<A NAME="722"></A>of yawning from him, so did he seem to be driven into a difficulty by my 
<A NAME="723"></A>difficulty. But as he had a reputation to maintain, he was ashamed to admit 
<A NAME="724"></A>before the company that he could not answer my challenge or determine the 
<A NAME="725"></A>question at issue; and he made an unintelligible attempt to hide his perplexity. 
<A NAME="726"></A>In order that the argument might proceed, I said to him, Well then Critias, 
<A NAME="727"></A>if you like, let us assume that there is this science of science; whether 
<A NAME="728"></A>the assumption is right or wrong may hereafter be investigated. Admitting 
<A NAME="729"></A>the existence of it, will you tell me how such a science enables us to 
<A NAME="730"></A>distinguish what we know or do not know, which, as we were saying, is self-knowledge 
<A NAME="731"></A>or wisdom: so we were saying?
<A NAME="732"></A><BR><BR>Yes, Socrates, he said; and that I think is certainly true: for 
<A NAME="733"></A>he who has this science or knowledge which knows itself will become like 
<A NAME="734"></A>the knowledge which he has, in the same way that he who has swiftness will 
<A NAME="735"></A>be swift, and he who has beauty will be beautiful, and he who has knowledge 
<A NAME="736"></A>will know. In the same way he who has that knowledge which is self-knowing, 
<A NAME="737"></A>will know himself.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>I do not doubt, I said, that a man will know himself, when he possesses 
<A NAME="739"></A>that which has self-knowledge: but what necessity is there that, having 
<A NAME="740"></A>this, he should know what he knows and what he does not 
<A NAME="741"></A>know?
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR>Because, Socrates, they are the same.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>Very likely, I said; but I remain as stupid as ever; for still I fail 
<A NAME="744"></A>to comprehend how this knowing what you know and do not know is the same 
<A NAME="745"></A>as the knowledge of self.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean? he said.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>This is what I mean, I replied: I will admit that there is a science 
<A NAME="748"></A>of science;-can this do more than determine that of two things one is and 
<A NAME="749"></A>the other is not science or knowledge?
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR>No, just that.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>But is knowledge or want of knowledge of health the same as knowledge 
<A NAME="752"></A>or want of knowledge of justice?
<A NAME="753"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>The one is medicine, and the other is politics; whereas that of which 
<A NAME="755"></A>we are speaking is knowledge pure and simple.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>And if a man knows only, and has only knowledge of knowledge, and has 
<A NAME="758"></A>no further knowledge of health and justice, the probability is that he 
<A NAME="759"></A>will only know that he knows something, and has a certain knowledge, whether 
<A NAME="760"></A>concerning himself or other men.
<A NAME="761"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>Then how will this knowledge or science teach him to know what he knows? 
<A NAME="763"></A>Say that he knows health;-not wisdom or temperance, but the art of medicine 
<A NAME="764"></A>has taught it to him; and he has learned harmony from the art of music, 
<A NAME="765"></A>and building from the art of building, neither, from wisdom or temperance: 
<A NAME="766"></A>and the same of other things.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR><BR>That is evident.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>How will wisdom, regarded only as a knowledge of knowledge or science 
<A NAME="769"></A>of science, ever teach him that he knows health, or that he knows 
<A NAME="770"></A>building?
<A NAME="771"></A><BR><BR>It is impossible.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>Then he who is ignorant of these things will only know that he knows, 
<A NAME="773"></A>but not what he knows?
<A NAME="774"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>Then wisdom or being wise appears to be not the knowledge of the things 
<A NAME="776"></A>which we do or do not know, but only the knowledge that we know or do not 
<A NAME="777"></A>know?
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR>That is the inference.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>Then he who has this knowledge will not be able to examine whether 
<A NAME="780"></A>a pretender knows or does not know that which he says that he knows: he 
<A NAME="781"></A>will only know that he has a knowledge of some kind; but wisdom will not 
<A NAME="782"></A>show him of what the knowledge is?
<A NAME="783"></A><BR><BR>Plainly not.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>Neither will he be able to distinguish the pretender in medicine from 
<A NAME="785"></A>the true physician, nor between any other true and false professor of knowledge. 
<A NAME="786"></A>Let us consider the matter in this way: If the wise man or any other man 
<A NAME="787"></A>wants to distinguish the true physician from the false, how will he proceed? 
<A NAME="788"></A>He will not talk to him about medicine; and that, as we were saying, is 
<A NAME="789"></A>the only thing which the physician understands.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>And, on the other hand, the physician knows nothing of science, for 
<A NAME="792"></A>this has been assumed to be the province of wisdom.
<A NAME="793"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>And further, since medicine is science, we must infer that he does 
<A NAME="795"></A>not know anything of medicine.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>Then the wise man may indeed know that the physician has some kind 
<A NAME="798"></A>of science or knowledge; but when he wants to discover the nature of this 
<A NAME="799"></A>he will ask, What is the subject-matter? For the several sciences are distinguished 
<A NAME="800"></A>not by the mere fact that they are sciences, but by the nature of their 
<A NAME="801"></A>subjects. Is not that true?
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>Quite true.
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>And medicine is distinguished from other sciences as having the subject-matter 
<A NAME="804"></A>of health and disease?
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>And he who would enquire into the nature of medicine must pursue the 
<A NAME="807"></A>enquiry into health and disease, and not into what is 
<A NAME="808"></A>extraneous?
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>And he who judges rightly will judge of the physician as a physician 
<A NAME="811"></A>in what relates to these?
<A NAME="812"></A><BR><BR>He will.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>He will consider whether what he says is true, and whether what he 
<A NAME="814"></A>does is right, in relation to health and disease?
<A NAME="815"></A><BR><BR>He will.
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>But can any one attain the knowledge of either unless he have a of 
<A NAME="817"></A>medicine?
<A NAME="818"></A><BR><BR>He cannot.
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>No one at all, it would seem, except the physician can have this knowledge; 
<A NAME="820"></A>and therefore not the wise man; he would have to be a physician as well 
<A NAME="821"></A>as a wise man.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>Then, assuredly, wisdom or temperance, if only a science of science, 
<A NAME="824"></A>and of the absence of science or knowledge, will not be able to distinguish 
<A NAME="825"></A>the physician who knows from one who does not know but pretends or thinks 
<A NAME="826"></A>that he knows, or any other professor of anything at all; like any other 
<A NAME="827"></A>artist, he will only know his fellow in art or wisdom, and no one 
<A NAME="828"></A>else.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><BR>That is evident, he said.
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>But then what profit, Critias, I said, is there any longer in wisdom 
<A NAME="831"></A>or temperance which yet remains, if this is wisdom? If, indeed, as we were 
<A NAME="832"></A>supposing at first, the wise man had been able to distinguish what he knew 
<A NAME="833"></A>and did not know, and that he knew the one and did not know the other, 
<A NAME="834"></A>and to recognize a similar faculty of discernment in others, there would 
<A NAME="835"></A>certainly have been a great advantage in being wise; for then we should 
<A NAME="836"></A>never have made a mistake, but have passed through life the unerring guides 
<A NAME="837"></A>of ourselves and of those who are under us; and we should not have attempted 
<A NAME="838"></A>to do what we did not know, but we should have found out those who knew, 
<A NAME="839"></A>and have handed the business over to them and trusted in them; nor should 
<A NAME="840"></A>we have allowed those who were under us to do anything which they were 
<A NAME="841"></A>not likely to do well and they would be likely to do well just that of 
<A NAME="842"></A>which they had knowledge; and the house or state which was ordered or administered 
<A NAME="843"></A>under the guidance of wisdom, and everything else of which wisdom was the 
<A NAME="844"></A>lord, would have been well ordered; for truth guiding, and error having 
<A NAME="845"></A>been eliminated, in all their doings, men would have done well, and would 
<A NAME="846"></A>have been happy. Was not this, Critias, what we spoke of as the great advantage 
<A NAME="847"></A>of wisdom to know what is known and what is unknown to 
<A NAME="848"></A>us?
<A NAME="849"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>And now you perceive, I said, that no such science is to be found 
<A NAME="851"></A>anywhere.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR>I perceive, he said.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>May we assume then, I said, that wisdom, viewed in this new light merely 
<A NAME="854"></A>as a knowledge of knowledge and ignorance, has this advantage:-that he 
<A NAME="855"></A>who possesses such knowledge will more easily learn anything which he learns; 
<A NAME="856"></A>and that everything will be clearer to him, because, in addition to the 
<A NAME="857"></A>knowledge of individuals, he sees the science, and this also will better 
<A NAME="858"></A>enable him to test the knowledge which others have of what he knows himself; 
<A NAME="859"></A>whereas the enquirer who is without this knowledge may be supposed to have 
<A NAME="860"></A>a feebler and weaker insight? Are not these, my friend, the real advantages 
<A NAME="861"></A>which are to be gained from wisdom? And are not we looking and seeking 
<A NAME="862"></A>after something more than is to be found in her?
<A NAME="863"></A><BR><BR>That is very likely, he said.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>That is very likely, I said; and very likely, too, we have been enquiring 
<A NAME="865"></A>to no purpose; as I am led to infer, because I observe that if this is 
<A NAME="866"></A>wisdom, some strange consequences would follow. Let us, if you please, 
<A NAME="867"></A>assume the possibility of this science of sciences, and further admit and 
<A NAME="868"></A>allow, as was originally suggested, that wisdom is the knowledge of what 
<A NAME="869"></A>we know and do not know. Assuming all this, still, upon further consideration, 
<A NAME="870"></A>I am doubtful, Critias, whether wisdom, such as this, would do us much 
<A NAME="871"></A>good. For we were wrong, I think, in supposing, as we were saying just 
<A NAME="872"></A>now, that such wisdom ordering the government of house or state would be 
<A NAME="873"></A>a great benefit.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR>How so? he said.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>Why, I said, we were far too ready to admit the great benefits which 
<A NAME="876"></A>mankind would obtain from their severally doing the things which they knew, 
<A NAME="877"></A>and committing the things of which they are ignorant to those who were 
<A NAME="878"></A>better acquainted with them.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR>Were we not right in making that admission?
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>I think not.
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>How very strange, Socrates!
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>By the dog of Egypt, I said, there I agree with you; and I was thinking 
<A NAME="883"></A>as much just now when I said that strange consequences would follow, and 
<A NAME="884"></A>that I was afraid we were on the wrong track; for however ready we may 
<A NAME="885"></A>be to admit that this is wisdom, I certainly cannot make out what good 
<A NAME="886"></A>this sort of thing does to us.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean? he said; I wish that you could make me understand 
<A NAME="888"></A>what you mean.
<A NAME="889"></A><BR><BR>I dare say that what I am saying is nonsense, I replied; and yet 
<A NAME="890"></A>if a man has any feeling of what is due to himself, he cannot let the thought 
<A NAME="891"></A>which comes into his mind pass away unheeded and unexamined.
<A NAME="892"></A><BR><BR>I like that, he said.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>Hear, then, I said, my own dream; whether coming through the horn or 
<A NAME="894"></A>the ivory gate, I cannot tell. The dream is this: Let us suppose that wisdom 
<A NAME="895"></A>is such as we are now defining, and that she has absolute sway over us; 
<A NAME="896"></A>then each action will be done according to the arts or sciences, and no 
<A NAME="897"></A>one professing to be a pilot when he is not, or any physician or general, 
<A NAME="898"></A>or any one else pretending to know matters of which he is ignorant, will 
<A NAME="899"></A>deceive or elude us; our health will be improved; our safety at sea, and 
<A NAME="900"></A>also in battle, will be assured; our coats and shoes, and all other instruments 
<A NAME="901"></A>and implements will be skilfully made, because the workmen will be good 
<A NAME="902"></A>and true. Aye, and if you please, you may suppose that prophecy, which 
<A NAME="903"></A>is the knowledge of the future, will be under the control of wisdom, and 
<A NAME="904"></A>that she will deter deceivers and set up the true prophets in their place 
<A NAME="905"></A>as the revealers of the future. Now I quite agree that mankind, thus provided, 
<A NAME="906"></A>would live and act according to knowledge, for wisdom would watch and prevent 
<A NAME="907"></A>ignorance from intruding on us. But whether by acting according to knowledge 
<A NAME="908"></A>we shall act well and be happy, my dear Critias,-this is a point which 
<A NAME="909"></A>we have not yet been able to determine.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR><BR>Yet I think, he replied, that if you discard knowledge, you will 
<A NAME="911"></A>hardly find the crown of happiness in anything else.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR>But of what is this knowledge? I said. Just answer me that small 
<A NAME="913"></A>question. Do you mean a knowledge of shoemaking?
<A NAME="914"></A><BR><BR>God forbid.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>Or of working in brass?
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>Or in wool, or wood, or anything of that sort?
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>No, I do not.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>Then, I said, we are giving up the doctrine that he who lives according 
<A NAME="920"></A>to knowledge is happy, for these live according to knowledge, and yet they 
<A NAME="921"></A>are not allowed by you to be happy; but I think that you mean to confine 
<A NAME="922"></A>happiness to particular individuals who live according to knowledge, such 
<A NAME="923"></A>for example as the prophet, who, as I was saying, knows the future. Is 
<A NAME="924"></A>it of him you are speaking or of some one else?
<A NAME="925"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I mean him, but there are others as well.
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>Yes, I said, some one who knows the past and present as well as the 
<A NAME="927"></A>future, and is ignorant of nothing. Let us suppose that there is such a 
<A NAME="928"></A>person, and if there is, you will allow that he is the most knowing of 
<A NAME="929"></A>all living men.
<A NAME="930"></A><BR><BR>Certainly he is.
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>Yet I should like to know one thing more: which of the different kinds 
<A NAME="932"></A>of knowledge makes him happy? or do all equally make him 
<A NAME="933"></A>happy?
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR>Not all equally, he replied.
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>But which most tends to make him happy? the knowledge of what past, 
<A NAME="936"></A>present, or future thing? May I infer this to be the knowledge of the game 
<A NAME="937"></A>of draughts?
<A NAME="938"></A><BR><BR>Nonsense about the game of draughts.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>Or of computation?
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>No.
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>Or of health?
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>That is nearer the truth, he said.
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>And that knowledge which is nearest of all, I said, is the knowledge 
<A NAME="944"></A>of what?
<A NAME="945"></A><BR><BR>The knowledge with which he discerns good and 
<A NAME="946"></A>evil.
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>Monster! I said; you have been carrying me round in a circle, and all 
<A NAME="948"></A>this time hiding from me the fact that the life according to knowledge 
<A NAME="949"></A>is not that which makes men act rightly and be happy, not even if knowledge 
<A NAME="950"></A>include all the sciences, but one science only, that of good and evil. 
<A NAME="951"></A>For, let me ask you, Critias, whether, if you take away this, medicine 
<A NAME="952"></A>will not equally give health, and shoemaking equally produce shoes, and 
<A NAME="953"></A>the art of the weaver clothes?-whether the art of the pilot will not equally 
<A NAME="954"></A>save our lives at sea, and the art of the general in 
<A NAME="955"></A>war?
<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR>Quite so.
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>And yet, my dear Critias, none of these things will be well or beneficially 
<A NAME="958"></A>done, if the science of the good be wanting.
<A NAME="959"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>But that science is not wisdom or temperance, but a science of human 
<A NAME="961"></A>advantage; not a science of other sciences, or of ignorance, but of good 
<A NAME="962"></A>and evil: and if this be of use, then wisdom or temperance will not be 
<A NAME="963"></A>of use.
<A NAME="964"></A><BR><BR>And why, he replied, will not wisdom be of use? For, however much 
<A NAME="965"></A>we assume that wisdom is a science of sciences, and has a sway over other 
<A NAME="966"></A>sciences, surely she will have this particular science of the good under 
<A NAME="967"></A>her control, and in this way will benefit us.
<A NAME="968"></A><BR><BR>And will wisdom give health? I said; is not this rather the effect 
<A NAME="969"></A>of medicine? Or does wisdom do the work any of the other arts, do they 
<A NAME="970"></A>not each of them do their own work? Have we not long ago asseverated that 
<A NAME="971"></A>wisdom is only the knowledge of knowledge and of ignorance, and of nothing 
<A NAME="972"></A>else?
<A NAME="973"></A><BR><BR>That is obvious.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>Then wisdom will not be the producer of health.
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>The art of health is different.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>Yes, different.
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>Nor does wisdom give advantage, my good friend; for that again we have 
<A NAME="979"></A>just now been attributing to another art.
<A NAME="980"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>How then can wisdom be advantageous, when giving no 
<A NAME="982"></A>advantage?
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>That, Socrates, is certainly inconceivable.
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>You see then, Critias, that I was not far wrong in fearing that I could 
<A NAME="985"></A>have no sound notion about wisdom; I was quite right in depreciating myself; 
<A NAME="986"></A>for that which is admitted to be the best of all things would never have 
<A NAME="987"></A>seemed to us useless, if I had been good for anything at an enquiry. But 
<A NAME="988"></A>now I have been utterly defeated, and have failed to discover what that 
<A NAME="989"></A>is to which the imposer of names gave this name of temperance or wisdom. 
<A NAME="990"></A>And yet many more admissions were made by us than could be fairly granted; 
<A NAME="991"></A>for we admitted that there was a science of science, although the argument 
<A NAME="992"></A>said No, and protested against us; and we admitted further, that this science 
<A NAME="993"></A>knew the works of the other sciences (although this too was denied by the 
<A NAME="994"></A>argument), because we wanted to show that the wise man had knowledge of 
<A NAME="995"></A>what he knew and did not know; also we nobly disregarded, and never even 
<A NAME="996"></A>considered, the impossibility of a man knowing in a sort of way that which 
<A NAME="997"></A>he does not know at all; for our assumption was, that he knows that which 
<A NAME="998"></A>he does not know; than which nothing, as I think, can be more irrational. 
<A NAME="999"></A>And yet, after finding us so easy and good-natured, the enquiry is still 
<A NAME="1000"></A>unable to discover the truth; but mocks us to a degree, and has gone out 
<A NAME="1001"></A>of its way to prove the inutility of that which we admitted only by a sort 
<A NAME="1002"></A>of supposition and fiction to be the true definition of temperance or wisdom: 
<A NAME="1003"></A>which result, as far as I am concerned, is not so much to be lamented, 
<A NAME="1004"></A>I said. But for your sake, Charmides, I am very sorry-that you, having 
<A NAME="1005"></A>such beauty and such wisdom and temperance of soul, should have no profit 
<A NAME="1006"></A>or good in life from your wisdom and temperance. And still more am I grieved 
<A NAME="1007"></A>about the charm which I learned with so much pain, and to so little profit, 
<A NAME="1008"></A>from the Thracian, for the sake of a thing which is nothing worth. I think 
<A NAME="1009"></A>indeed that there is a mistake, and that I must be a bad enquirer, for 
<A NAME="1010"></A>wisdom or temperance I believe to be really a great good; and happy are 
<A NAME="1011"></A>you, Charmides, if you certainly possess it. Wherefore examine yourself, 
<A NAME="1012"></A>and see whether you have this gift and can do without the charm; for if 
<A NAME="1013"></A>you can, I would rather advise you to regard me simply as a fool who is 
<A NAME="1014"></A>never able to reason out anything; and to rest assured that the more wise 
<A NAME="1015"></A>and temperate you are, the happier you will be.
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR><BR>Charmides said: I am sure that I do not know, Socrates, whether 
<A NAME="1017"></A>I have or have not this gift of wisdom and temperance; for how can I know 
<A NAME="1018"></A>whether I have a thing, of which even you and Critias are, as you say, 
<A NAME="1019"></A>unable to discover the nature?-(not that I believe you.) And further, I 
<A NAME="1020"></A>am sure, Socrates, that I do need the charm, and as far as I am concerned, 
<A NAME="1021"></A>I shall be willing to be charmed by you daily, until you say that I have 
<A NAME="1022"></A>had enough.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR><BR>Very good, Charmides, said Critias; if you do this I shall have 
<A NAME="1024"></A>a proof of your temperance, that is, if you allow yourself to be charmed 
<A NAME="1025"></A>by Socrates, and never desert him at all.
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR><BR>You may depend on my following and not deserting him, said Charmides: 
<A NAME="1027"></A>if you who are my guardian command me, I should be very wrong not to obey 
<A NAME="1028"></A>you.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR>And I do command you, he said.
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>Then I will do as you say, and begin this very day.
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>You sirs, I said, what are you conspiring about?
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>We are not conspiring, said Charmides, we have conspired 
<A NAME="1033"></A>already.
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>And are you about to use violence, without even going through the forms 
<A NAME="1035"></A>of justice?
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I shall use violence, he replied, since he orders me; and 
<A NAME="1037"></A>therefore you had better consider well.
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR><BR>But the time for consideration has passed, I said, when violence 
<A NAME="1039"></A>is employed; and you, when you are determined on anything, and in the mood 
<A NAME="1040"></A>of violence, are irresistible.
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR><BR>Do not you resist me then, he said.
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>I will not resist you, I replied.
