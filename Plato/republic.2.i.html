<A NAME="10"></A>Socrates - GLAUCON
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>I went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston, 
<A NAME="12"></A>that I might offer up my prayers to the goddess; and also because I wanted 
<A NAME="13"></A>to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival, which was a new 
<A NAME="14"></A>thing. I was delighted with the procession of the inhabitants; but that 
<A NAME="15"></A>of the Thracians was equally, if not more, beautiful. When we had finished 
<A NAME="16"></A>our prayers and viewed the spectacle, we turned in the direction of the 
<A NAME="17"></A>city; and at that instant Polemarchus the son of Cephalus chanced to catch 
<A NAME="18"></A>sight of us from a distance as we were starting on our way home, and told 
<A NAME="19"></A>his servant to run and bid us wait for him. The servant took hold of me 
<A NAME="20"></A>by the cloak behind, and said: Polemarchus desires you to 
<A NAME="21"></A>wait.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>I turned round, and asked him where his master 
<A NAME="23"></A>was.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>There he is, said the youth, coming after you, if you will only 
<A NAME="25"></A>wait.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>Certainly we will, said Glaucon; and in a few minutes Polemarchus 
<A NAME="27"></A>appeared, and with him Adeimantus, Glaucon's brother, Niceratus the son 
<A NAME="28"></A>of Nicias, and several others who had been at the procession.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>Socrates - POLEMARCHUS - GLAUCON - ADEIMANTUS
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Polemarchus said to me: I perceive, Socrates, that you and our 
<A NAME="31"></A>companion are already on your way to the city.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>You are not far wrong, I said.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>But do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>And are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will have to remain 
<A NAME="36"></A>where you are.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>May there not be the alternative, I said, that we may persuade 
<A NAME="38"></A>you to let us go?
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>But can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he 
<A NAME="40"></A>said.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Certainly not, replied Glaucon.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Then we are not going to listen; of that you may be 
<A NAME="43"></A>assured.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Adeimantus added: Has no one told you of the torch-race on horseback 
<A NAME="45"></A>in honour of the goddess which will take place in the 
<A NAME="46"></A>evening?
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>With horses! I replied: That is a novelty. Will horsemen carry 
<A NAME="48"></A>torches and pass them one to another during the race?
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>Yes, said Polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will he 
<A NAME="50"></A>celebrated at night, which you certainly ought to see. Let us rise soon 
<A NAME="51"></A>after supper and see this festival; there will be a gathering of young 
<A NAME="52"></A>men, and we will have a good talk. Stay then, and do not be 
<A NAME="53"></A>perverse.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>Glaucon said: I suppose, since you insist, that we 
<A NAME="55"></A>must.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Very good, I replied.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>Glaucon - CEPHALUS - SOCRATES
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly we went with Polemarchus to his house; and there we 
<A NAME="59"></A>found his brothers Lysias and Euthydemus, and with them Thrasymachus the 
<A NAME="60"></A>Chalcedonian, Charmantides the Paeanian, and Cleitophon the son of Aristonymus. 
<A NAME="61"></A>There too was Cephalus the father of Polemarchus, whom I had not seen for 
<A NAME="62"></A>a long time, and I thought him very much aged. He was seated on a cushioned 
<A NAME="63"></A>chair, and had a garland on his head, for he had been sacrificing in the 
<A NAME="64"></A>court; and there were some other chairs in the room arranged in a semicircle, 
<A NAME="65"></A>upon which we sat down by him. He saluted me eagerly, and then he said: 
<A NAME="66"></A>--
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>You don't come to see me, Socrates, as often as you ought: If I 
<A NAME="68"></A>were still able to go and see you I would not ask you to come to me. But 
<A NAME="69"></A>at my age I can hardly get to the city, and therefore you should come oftener 
<A NAME="70"></A>to the Piraeus. For let me tell you, that the more the pleasures of the 
<A NAME="71"></A>body fade away, the greater to me is the pleasure and charm of conversation. 
<A NAME="72"></A>Do not then deny my request, but make our house your resort and keep company 
<A NAME="73"></A>with these young men; we are old friends, and you will be quite at home 
<A NAME="74"></A>with us.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>I replied: There is nothing which for my part I like better, Cephalus, 
<A NAME="76"></A>than conversing with aged men; for I regard them as travellers who have 
<A NAME="77"></A>gone a journey which I too may have to go, and of whom I ought to enquire, 
<A NAME="78"></A>whether the way is smooth and easy, or rugged and difficult. And this is 
<A NAME="79"></A>a question which I should like to ask of you who have arrived at that time 
<A NAME="80"></A>which the poets call the 'threshold of old age' --Is life harder towards 
<A NAME="81"></A>the end, or what report do you give of it?
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>I will tell you, Socrates, he said, what my own feeling is. Men 
<A NAME="83"></A>of my age flock together; we are birds of a feather, as the old proverb 
<A NAME="84"></A>says; and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is --I cannot 
<A NAME="85"></A>eat, I cannot drink; the pleasures of youth and love are fled away: there 
<A NAME="86"></A>was a good time once, but now that is gone, and life is no longer life. 
<A NAME="87"></A>Some complain of the slights which are put upon them by relations, and 
<A NAME="88"></A>they will tell you sadly of how many evils their old age is the cause. 
<A NAME="89"></A>But to me, Socrates, these complainers seem to blame that which is not 
<A NAME="90"></A>really in fault. For if old age were the cause, I too being old, and every 
<A NAME="91"></A>other old man, would have felt as they do. But this is not my own experience, 
<A NAME="92"></A>nor that of others whom I have known. How well I remember the aged poet 
<A NAME="93"></A>Sophocles, when in answer to the question, How does love suit with age, 
<A NAME="94"></A>Sophocles, --are you still the man you were? Peace, he replied; most gladly 
<A NAME="95"></A>have I escaped the thing of which you speak; I feel as if I had escaped 
<A NAME="96"></A>from a mad and furious master. His words have often occurred to my mind 
<A NAME="97"></A>since, and they seem as good to me now as at the time when he uttered them. 
<A NAME="98"></A>For certainly old age has a great sense of calm and freedom; when the passions 
<A NAME="99"></A>relax their hold, then, as Sophocles says, we are freed from the grasp 
<A NAME="100"></A>not of one mad master only, but of many. The truth is, Socrates, that these 
<A NAME="101"></A>regrets, and also the complaints about relations, are to be attributed 
<A NAME="102"></A>to the same cause, which is not old age, but men's characters and tempers; 
<A NAME="103"></A>for he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressure 
<A NAME="104"></A>of age, but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age are 
<A NAME="105"></A>equally a burden.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>I listened in admiration, and wanting to draw him out, that he 
<A NAME="107"></A>might go on --Yes, Cephalus, I said: but I rather suspect that people in 
<A NAME="108"></A>general are not convinced by you when you speak thus; they think that old 
<A NAME="109"></A>age sits lightly upon you, not because of your happy disposition, but because 
<A NAME="110"></A>you are rich, and wealth is well known to be a great 
<A NAME="111"></A>comforter.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>You are right, he replied; they are not convinced: and there is 
<A NAME="113"></A>something in what they say; not, however, so much as they imagine. I might 
<A NAME="114"></A>answer them as Themistocles answered the Seriphian who was abusing him 
<A NAME="115"></A>and saying that he was famous, not for his own merits but because he was 
<A NAME="116"></A>an Athenian: 'If you had been a native of my country or I of yours, neither 
<A NAME="117"></A>of us would have been famous.' And to those who are not rich and are impatient 
<A NAME="118"></A>of old age, the same reply may be made; for to the good poor man old age 
<A NAME="119"></A>cannot be a light burden, nor can a bad rich man ever have peace with 
<A NAME="120"></A>himself.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>May I ask, Cephalus, whether your fortune was for the most part 
<A NAME="122"></A>inherited or acquired by you?
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>Acquired! Socrates; do you want to know how much I acquired? In 
<A NAME="124"></A>the art of making money I have been midway between my father and grandfather: 
<A NAME="125"></A>for my grandfather, whose name I bear, doubled and trebled the value of 
<A NAME="126"></A>his patrimony, that which he inherited being much what I possess now; but 
<A NAME="127"></A>my father Lysanias reduced the property below what it is at present: and 
<A NAME="128"></A>I shall be satisfied if I leave to these my sons not less but a little 
<A NAME="129"></A>more than I received.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>That was why I asked you the question, I replied, because I see 
<A NAME="131"></A>that you are indifferent about money, which is a characteristic rather 
<A NAME="132"></A>of those who have inherited their fortunes than of those who have acquired 
<A NAME="133"></A>them; the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as a creation 
<A NAME="134"></A>of their own, resembling the affection of authors for their own poems, 
<A NAME="135"></A>or of parents for their children, besides that natural love of it for the 
<A NAME="136"></A>sake of use and profit which is common to them and all men. And hence they 
<A NAME="137"></A>are very bad company, for they can talk about nothing but the praises of 
<A NAME="138"></A>wealth. That is true, he said.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that is very true, but may I ask another question? What do 
<A NAME="140"></A>you consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your 
<A NAME="141"></A>wealth?
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>One, he said, of which I could not expect easily to convince others. 
<A NAME="143"></A>For let me tell you, Socrates, that when a man thinks himself to be near 
<A NAME="144"></A>death, fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had before; the 
<A NAME="145"></A>tales of a world below and the punishment which is exacted there of deeds 
<A NAME="146"></A>done here were once a laughing matter to him, but now he is tormented with 
<A NAME="147"></A>the thought that they may be true: either from the weakness of age, or 
<A NAME="148"></A>because he is now drawing nearer to that other place, he has a clearer 
<A NAME="149"></A>view of these things; suspicions and alarms crowd thickly upon him, and 
<A NAME="150"></A>he begins to reflect and consider what wrongs he has done to others. And 
<A NAME="151"></A>when he finds that the sum of his transgressions is great he will many 
<A NAME="152"></A>a time like a child start up in his sleep for fear, and he is filled with 
<A NAME="153"></A>dark forebodings. But to him who is conscious of no sin, sweet hope, as 
<A NAME="154"></A>Pindar charmingly says, is the kind nurse of his age:
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Hope, he says, cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice and 
<A NAME="156"></A>holiness and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his journey; 
<A NAME="157"></A>--hope which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of 
<A NAME="158"></A>man.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>How admirable are his words! And the great blessing of riches, 
<A NAME="160"></A>I do not say to every man, but to a good man, is, that he has had no occasion 
<A NAME="161"></A>to deceive or to defraud others, either intentionally or unintentionally; 
<A NAME="162"></A>and when he departs to the world below he is not in any apprehension about 
<A NAME="163"></A>offerings due to the gods or debts which he owes to men. Now to this peace 
<A NAME="164"></A>of mind the possession of wealth greatly contributes; and therefore I say, 
<A NAME="165"></A>that, setting one thing against another, of the many advantages which wealth 
<A NAME="166"></A>has to give, to a man of sense this is in my opinion the 
<A NAME="167"></A>greatest.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>Well said, Cephalus, I replied; but as concerning justice, what 
<A NAME="169"></A>is it? --to speak the truth and to pay your debts --no more than this? 
<A NAME="170"></A>And even to this are there not exceptions? Suppose that a friend when in 
<A NAME="171"></A>his right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he 
<A NAME="172"></A>is not in his right mind, ought I to give them back to him? No one would 
<A NAME="173"></A>say that I ought or that I should be right in doing so, any more than they 
<A NAME="174"></A>would say that I ought always to speak the truth to one who is in his 
<A NAME="175"></A>condition.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>You are quite right, he replied.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>But then, I said, speaking the truth and paying your debts is not a 
<A NAME="178"></A>correct definition of justice.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>Cephalus - SOCRATES - POLEMARCHUS
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>Quite correct, Socrates, if Simonides is to be believed, said Polemarchus 
<A NAME="181"></A>interposing.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>I fear, said Cephalus, that I must go now, for I have to look after 
<A NAME="183"></A>the sacrifices, and I hand over the argument to Polemarchus and the 
<A NAME="184"></A>company.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>Is not Polemarchus your heir? I said.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>To be sure, he answered, and went away laughing to the 
<A NAME="187"></A>sacrifices.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>Socrates - POLEMARCHUS
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>Tell me then, O thou heir of the argument, what did Simonides say, 
<A NAME="190"></A>and according to you truly say, about justice?
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>He said that the repayment of a debt is just, and in saying so 
<A NAME="192"></A>he appears to me to be right.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>I should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired 
<A NAME="194"></A>man, but his meaning, though probably clear to you, is the reverse of clear 
<A NAME="195"></A>to me. For he certainly does not mean, as we were now saying that I ought 
<A NAME="196"></A>to return a return a deposit of arms or of anything else to one who asks 
<A NAME="197"></A>for it when he is not in his right senses; and yet a deposit cannot be 
<A NAME="198"></A>denied to be a debt.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind I am by no 
<A NAME="201"></A>means to make the return?
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>When Simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice, he did 
<A NAME="204"></A>not mean to include that case?
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not; for he thinks that a friend ought always to do good 
<A NAME="206"></A>to a friend and never evil.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>You mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injury 
<A NAME="208"></A>of the receiver, if the two parties are friends, is not the repayment of 
<A NAME="209"></A>a debt, --that is what you would imagine him to say?
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>And are enemies also to receive what we owe to them?
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>To be sure, he said, they are to receive what we owe them, and an enemy, 
<A NAME="213"></A>as I take it, owes to an enemy that which is due or proper to him --that 
<A NAME="214"></A>is to say, evil.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>Simonides, then, after the manner of poets, would seem to have 
<A NAME="216"></A>spoken darkly of the nature of justice; for he really meant to say that 
<A NAME="217"></A>justice is the giving to each man what is proper to him, and this he termed 
<A NAME="218"></A>a debt.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>That must have been his meaning, he said.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>By heaven! I replied; and if we asked him what due or proper thing 
<A NAME="221"></A>is given by medicine, and to whom, what answer do you think that he would 
<A NAME="222"></A>make to us?
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>He would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink 
<A NAME="224"></A>to human bodies.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>And what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to 
<A NAME="226"></A>what?
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Seasoning to food.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>And what is that which justice gives, and to whom?
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>If, Socrates, we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the preceding 
<A NAME="230"></A>instances, then justice is the art which gives good to friends and evil 
<A NAME="231"></A>to enemies.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>That is his meaning then?
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>I think so.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>And who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies 
<A NAME="235"></A>in time of sickness?
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>The physician.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Or when they are on a voyage, amid the perils of the 
<A NAME="238"></A>sea?
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>The pilot.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>And in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the just 
<A NAME="241"></A>man most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his 
<A NAME="242"></A>friends?
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>In going to war against the one and in making alliances with the 
<A NAME="244"></A>other.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>But when a man is well, my dear Polemarchus, there is no need of 
<A NAME="246"></A>a physician?
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>No.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>And he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot?
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>No.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Then in time of peace justice will be of no use?
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>I am very far from thinking so.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>You think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in 
<A NAME="253"></A>war?
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Like husbandry for the acquisition of corn?
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes, --that is what you 
<A NAME="258"></A>mean?
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>And what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of 
<A NAME="261"></A>peace?
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>In contracts, Socrates, justice is of use.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>And by contracts you mean partnerships?
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>But is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and better 
<A NAME="266"></A>partner at a game of draughts?
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>The skilful player.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>And in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more useful 
<A NAME="269"></A>or better partner than the builder?
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>Quite the reverse.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than 
<A NAME="272"></A>the harp-player, as in playing the harp the harp-player is certainly a 
<A NAME="273"></A>better partner than the just man?
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>In a money partnership.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Yes, Polemarchus, but surely not in the use of money; for you do not 
<A NAME="276"></A>want a just man to be your counsellor the purchase or sale of a horse; 
<A NAME="277"></A>a man who is knowing about horses would be better for that, would he 
<A NAME="278"></A>not?
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>And when you want to buy a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would 
<A NAME="281"></A>be better?
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man 
<A NAME="284"></A>is to be preferred?
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>When you want a deposit to be kept safely.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>You mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to 
<A NAME="287"></A>lie?
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Precisely.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>That is to say, justice is useful when money is 
<A NAME="290"></A>useless?
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>That is the inference.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>And when you want to keep a pruning-hook safe, then justice is useful 
<A NAME="293"></A>to the individual and to the state; but when you want to use it, then the 
<A NAME="294"></A>art of the vine-dresser?
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>And when you want to keep a shield or a lyre, and not to use them, 
<A NAME="297"></A>you would say that justice is useful; but when you want to use them, then 
<A NAME="298"></A>the art of the soldier or of the musician?
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>And so of all the other things; --justice is useful when they are useless, 
<A NAME="301"></A>and useless when they are useful?
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>That is the inference.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Then justice is not good for much. But let us consider this further 
<A NAME="304"></A>point: Is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxing match or in any 
<A NAME="305"></A>kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow?
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>And he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease 
<A NAME="308"></A>is best able to create one?
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>And he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a march 
<A NAME="311"></A>upon the enemy?
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>Then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good 
<A NAME="314"></A>thief?
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>That, I suppose, is to be inferred.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Then if the just man is good at keeping money, he is good at stealing 
<A NAME="317"></A>it.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>That is implied in the argument.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief. And this 
<A NAME="320"></A>is a lesson which I suspect you must have learnt out of Homer; for he, 
<A NAME="321"></A>speaking of Autolycus, the maternal grandfather of Odysseus, who is a favourite 
<A NAME="322"></A>of his, affirms that
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>He was excellent above all men in theft and perjury. And so, you 
<A NAME="324"></A>and Homer and Simonides are agreed that justice is an art of theft; to 
<A NAME="325"></A>be practised however 'for the good of friends and for the harm of enemies,' 
<A NAME="326"></A>--that was what you were saying?
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>No, certainly not that, though I do not now know what I did say; 
<A NAME="328"></A>but I still stand by the latter words.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>Well, there is another question: By friends and enemies do we mean 
<A NAME="330"></A>those who are so really, or only in seeming?
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>Surely, he said, a man may be expected to love those whom he thinks 
<A NAME="332"></A>good, and to hate those whom he thinks evil.
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>Yes, but do not persons often err about good and evil: many who 
<A NAME="334"></A>are not good seem to be so, and conversely?
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>That is true.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their friends? 
<A NAME="337"></A>True.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>And in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and 
<A NAME="339"></A>evil to the good?
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>But the good are just and would not do an injustice?
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do no 
<A NAME="344"></A>wrong?
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>Nay, Socrates; the doctrine is immoral.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>Then I suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the 
<A NAME="347"></A>unjust?
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>I like that better.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>But see the consequence: --Many a man who is ignorant of human nature 
<A NAME="350"></A>has friends who are bad friends, and in that case he ought to do harm to 
<A NAME="351"></A>them; and he has good enemies whom he ought to benefit; but, if so, we 
<A NAME="352"></A>shall be saying the very opposite of that which we affirmed to be the meaning 
<A NAME="353"></A>of Simonides.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said: and I think that we had better correct an error 
<A NAME="355"></A>into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the words 'friend' and 
<A NAME="356"></A>'enemy.'
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>What was the error, Polemarchus? I asked.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>We assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thought 
<A NAME="359"></A>good.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>And how is the error to be corrected?
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>We should rather say that he is a friend who is, as well as seems, 
<A NAME="362"></A>good; and that he who seems only, and is not good, only seems to be and 
<A NAME="363"></A>is not a friend; and of an enemy the same may be said.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>You would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our 
<A NAME="365"></A>enemies?
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>And instead of saying simply as we did at first, that it is just to 
<A NAME="368"></A>do good to our friends and harm to our enemies, we should further say: 
<A NAME="369"></A>It is just to do good to our friends when they are good and harm to our 
<A NAME="370"></A>enemies when they are evil?
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that appears to me to be the truth.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>But ought the just to injure any one at all?
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his 
<A NAME="374"></A>enemies.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>When horses are injured, are they improved or 
<A NAME="376"></A>deteriorated?
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>The latter.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Deteriorated, that is to say, in the good qualities of horses, not 
<A NAME="379"></A>of dogs?
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>Yes, of horses.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>And dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs, and not of 
<A NAME="382"></A>horses?
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>And will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which is the 
<A NAME="385"></A>proper virtue of man?
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>And that human virtue is justice?
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>To be sure.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>Then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust?
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>That is the result.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>But can the musician by his art make men unmusical?
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen?
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>And can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking general can 
<A NAME="396"></A>the good by virtue make them bad?
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>Assuredly not.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Any more than heat can produce cold?
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>It cannot.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Or drought moisture?
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Clearly not.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>Nor can the good harm any one?
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>And the just is the good?
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man, 
<A NAME="407"></A>but of the opposite, who is the unjust?
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>I think that what you say is quite true, Socrates.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of debts, 
<A NAME="410"></A>and that good is the debt which a man owes to his friends, and evil the 
<A NAME="411"></A>debt which he owes to his enemies, --to say this is not wise; for it is 
<A NAME="412"></A>not true, if, as has been clearly shown, the injuring of another can be 
<A NAME="413"></A>in no case just.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>I agree with you, said Polemarchus.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Then you and I are prepared to take up arms against any one who attributes 
<A NAME="416"></A>such a saying to Simonides or Bias or Pittacus, or any other wise man or 
<A NAME="417"></A>seer?
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>I am quite ready to do battle at your side, he 
<A NAME="419"></A>said.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Shall I tell you whose I believe the saying to be?
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Whose?
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>I believe that Periander or Perdiccas or Xerxes or Ismenias the Theban, 
<A NAME="423"></A>or some other rich and mighty man, who had a great opinion of his own power, 
<A NAME="424"></A>was the first to say that justice is 'doing good to your friends and harm 
<A NAME="425"></A>to your enemies.'
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>Most true, he said.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Yes, I said; but if this definition of justice also breaks down, what 
<A NAME="428"></A>other can be offered?
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>Several times in the course of the discussion Thrasymachus had 
<A NAME="430"></A>made an attempt to get the argument into his own hands, and had been put 
<A NAME="431"></A>down by the rest of the company, who wanted to hear the end. But when Polemarchus 
<A NAME="432"></A>and I had done speaking and there was a pause, he could no longer hold 
<A NAME="433"></A>his peace; and, gathering himself up, he came at us like a wild beast, 
<A NAME="434"></A>seeking to devour us. We were quite panic-stricken at the sight of 
<A NAME="435"></A>him.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>Socrates - POLEMARCHUS - THRASYMACHUS
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>He roared out to the whole company: What folly. Socrates, has taken 
<A NAME="438"></A>possession of you all? And why, sillybillies, do you knock under to one 
<A NAME="439"></A>another? I say that if you want really to know what justice is, you should 
<A NAME="440"></A>not only ask but answer, and you should not seek honour to yourself from 
<A NAME="441"></A>the refutation of an opponent, but have your own answer; for there is many 
<A NAME="442"></A>a one who can ask and cannot answer. And now I will not have you say that 
<A NAME="443"></A>justice is duty or advantage or profit or gain or interest, for this sort 
<A NAME="444"></A>of nonsense will not do for me; I must have clearness and 
<A NAME="445"></A>accuracy.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR>I was panic-stricken at his words, and could not look at him without 
<A NAME="447"></A>trembling. Indeed I believe that if I had not fixed my eye upon him, I 
<A NAME="448"></A>should have been struck dumb: but when I saw his fury rising, I looked 
<A NAME="449"></A>at him first, and was therefore able to reply to him.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>Thrasymachus, I said, with a quiver, don't be hard upon us. Polemarchus 
<A NAME="451"></A>and I may have been guilty of a little mistake in the argument, but I can 
<A NAME="452"></A>assure you that the error was not intentional. If we were seeking for a 
<A NAME="453"></A>piece of gold, you would not imagine that we were 'knocking under to one 
<A NAME="454"></A>another,' and so losing our chance of finding it. And why, when we are 
<A NAME="455"></A>seeking for justice, a thing more precious than many pieces of gold, do 
<A NAME="456"></A>you say that we are weakly yielding to one another and not doing our utmost 
<A NAME="457"></A>to get at the truth? Nay, my good friend, we are most willing and anxious 
<A NAME="458"></A>to do so, but the fact is that we cannot. And if so, you people who know 
<A NAME="459"></A>all things should pity us and not be angry with us.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>How characteristic of Socrates! he replied, with a bitter laugh; 
<A NAME="461"></A>--that's your ironical style! Did I not foresee --have I not already told 
<A NAME="462"></A>you, that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer, and try irony 
<A NAME="463"></A>or any other shuffle, in order that he might avoid answering?
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR>You are a philosopher, Thrasymachus, I replied, and well know that 
<A NAME="465"></A>if you ask a person what numbers make up twelve, taking care to prohibit 
<A NAME="466"></A>him whom you ask from answering twice six, or three times four, or six 
<A NAME="467"></A>times two, or four times three, 'for this sort of nonsense will not do 
<A NAME="468"></A>for me,' --then obviously, that is your way of putting the question, no 
<A NAME="469"></A>one can answer you. But suppose that he were to retort, 'Thrasymachus, 
<A NAME="470"></A>what do you mean? If one of these numbers which you interdict be the true 
<A NAME="471"></A>answer to the question, am I falsely to say some other number which is 
<A NAME="472"></A>not the right one? --is that your meaning?' -How would you answer 
<A NAME="473"></A>him?
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>Just as if the two cases were at all alike! he 
<A NAME="475"></A>said.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>Why should they not be? I replied; and even if they are not, but only 
<A NAME="477"></A>appear to be so to the person who is asked, ought he not to say what he 
<A NAME="478"></A>thinks, whether you and I forbid him or not?
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>I presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted 
<A NAME="480"></A>answers?
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR>I dare say that I may, notwithstanding the danger, if upon reflection 
<A NAME="482"></A>I approve of any of them.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>But what if I give you an answer about justice other and better, 
<A NAME="484"></A>he said, than any of these? What do you deserve to have done to 
<A NAME="485"></A>you?
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>Done to me! --as becomes the ignorant, I must learn from the wise 
<A NAME="487"></A>--that is what I deserve to have done to me.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR>What, and no payment! a pleasant notion!
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>I will pay when I have the money, I replied.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR>Socrates - THRASYMACHUS - GLAUCON
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>But you have, Socrates, said Glaucon: and you, Thrasymachus, need 
<A NAME="492"></A>be under no anxiety about money, for we will all make a contribution for 
<A NAME="493"></A>Socrates.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he replied, and then Socrates will do as he always does --refuse 
<A NAME="495"></A>to answer himself, but take and pull to pieces the answer of some one 
<A NAME="496"></A>else.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR>Why, my good friend, I said, how can any one answer who knows, 
<A NAME="498"></A>and says that he knows, just nothing; and who, even if he has some faint 
<A NAME="499"></A>notions of his own, is told by a man of authority not to utter them? The 
<A NAME="500"></A>natural thing is, that the speaker should be some one like yourself who 
<A NAME="501"></A>professes to know and can tell what he knows. Will you then kindly answer, 
<A NAME="502"></A>for the edification of the company and of myself ?
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR>Glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request and Thrasymachus, 
<A NAME="504"></A>as any one might see, was in reality eager to speak; for he thought that 
<A NAME="505"></A>he had an excellent answer, and would distinguish himself. But at first 
<A NAME="506"></A>he to insist on my answering; at length he consented to begin. Behold, 
<A NAME="507"></A>he said, the wisdom of Socrates; he refuses to teach himself, and goes 
<A NAME="508"></A>about learning of others, to whom he never even says thank 
<A NAME="509"></A>you.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>That I learn of others, I replied, is quite true; but that I am 
<A NAME="511"></A>ungrateful I wholly deny. Money I have none, and therefore I pay in praise, 
<A NAME="512"></A>which is all I have: and how ready I am to praise any one who appears to 
<A NAME="513"></A>me to speak well you will very soon find out when you answer; for I expect 
<A NAME="514"></A>that you will answer well.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR>Listen, then, he said; I proclaim that justice is nothing else 
<A NAME="516"></A>than the interest of the stronger. And now why do you not me? But of course 
<A NAME="517"></A>you won't.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>Let me first understand you, I replied. justice, as you say, is 
<A NAME="519"></A>the interest of the stronger. What, Thrasymachus, is the meaning of this? 
<A NAME="520"></A>You cannot mean to say that because Polydamas, the pancratiast, is stronger 
<A NAME="521"></A>than we are, and finds the eating of beef conducive to his bodily strength, 
<A NAME="522"></A>that to eat beef is therefore equally for our good who are weaker than 
<A NAME="523"></A>he is, and right and just for us?
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>That's abominable of you, Socrates; you take the words in the sense 
<A NAME="525"></A>which is most damaging to the argument.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>Not at all, my good sir, I said; I am trying to understand them; 
<A NAME="527"></A>and I wish that you would be a little clearer.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>Well, he said, have you never heard that forms of government differ; 
<A NAME="529"></A>there are tyrannies, and there are democracies, and there are 
<A NAME="530"></A>aristocracies?
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I know.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>And the government is the ruling power in each state?
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>And the different forms of government make laws democratical, aristocratical, 
<A NAME="535"></A>tyrannical, with a view to their several interests; and these laws, which 
<A NAME="536"></A>are made by them for their own interests, are the justice which they deliver 
<A NAME="537"></A>to their subjects, and him who transgresses them they punish as a breaker 
<A NAME="538"></A>of the law, and unjust. And that is what I mean when I say that in all 
<A NAME="539"></A>states there is the same principle of justice, which is the interest of 
<A NAME="540"></A>the government; and as the government must be supposed to have power, the 
<A NAME="541"></A>only reasonable conclusion is, that everywhere there is one principle of 
<A NAME="542"></A>justice, which is the interest of the stronger.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR>Now I understand you, I said; and whether you are right or not 
<A NAME="544"></A>I will try to discover. But let me remark, that in defining justice you 
<A NAME="545"></A>have yourself used the word 'interest' which you forbade me to use. It 
<A NAME="546"></A>is true, however, that in your definition the words 'of the stronger' are 
<A NAME="547"></A>added.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR>A small addition, you must allow, he said.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Great or small, never mind about that: we must first enquire whether 
<A NAME="550"></A>what you are saying is the truth. Now we are both agreed that justice is 
<A NAME="551"></A>interest of some sort, but you go on to say 'of the stronger'; about this 
<A NAME="552"></A>addition I am not so sure, and must therefore consider 
<A NAME="553"></A>further.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>Proceed.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>I will; and first tell me, Do you admit that it is just or subjects 
<A NAME="556"></A>to obey their rulers?
<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>I do.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>But are the rulers of states absolutely infallible, or are they sometimes 
<A NAME="559"></A>liable to err?
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>To be sure, he replied, they are liable to err.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Then in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly, and 
<A NAME="562"></A>sometimes not?
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>When they make them rightly, they make them agreeably to their interest; 
<A NAME="565"></A>when they are mistaken, contrary to their interest; you admit 
<A NAME="566"></A>that?
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>And the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects, --and 
<A NAME="569"></A>that is what you call justice?
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR>Doubtless.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Then justice, according to your argument, is not only obedience to 
<A NAME="572"></A>the interest of the stronger but the reverse?
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>What is that you are saying? he asked.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>I am only repeating what you are saying, I believe. But let us consider: 
<A NAME="575"></A>Have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about their own interest 
<A NAME="576"></A>in what they command, and also that to obey them is justice? Has not that 
<A NAME="577"></A>been admitted?
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the interest 
<A NAME="580"></A>of the stronger, when the rulers unintentionally command things to be done 
<A NAME="581"></A>which are to their own injury. For if, as you say, justice is the obedience 
<A NAME="582"></A>which the subject renders to their commands, in that case, O wisest of 
<A NAME="583"></A>men, is there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker are commanded 
<A NAME="584"></A>to do, not what is for the interest, but what is for the injury of the 
<A NAME="585"></A>stronger?
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR>Nothing can be clearer, Socrates, said Polemarchus.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR>Socrates - CLEITOPHON - POLEMARCHUS - THRASYMACHUS
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR>Yes, said Cleitophon, interposing, if you are allowed to be his 
<A NAME="589"></A>witness.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>But there is no need of any witness, said Polemarchus, for Thrasymachus 
<A NAME="591"></A>himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not for 
<A NAME="592"></A>their own interest, and that for subjects to obey them is 
<A NAME="593"></A>justice.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR>Yes, Polemarchus, --Thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what 
<A NAME="595"></A>was commanded by their rulers is just.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>Yes, Cleitophon, but he also said that justice is the interest 
<A NAME="597"></A>of the stronger, and, while admitting both these propositions, he further 
<A NAME="598"></A>acknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are his subjects 
<A NAME="599"></A>to do what is not for his own interest; whence follows that justice is 
<A NAME="600"></A>the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>But, said Cleitophon, he meant by the interest of the stronger 
<A NAME="602"></A>what the stronger thought to be his interest, --this was what the weaker 
<A NAME="603"></A>had to do; and this was affirmed by him to be justice.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR>Those were not his words, rejoined Polemarchus.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>Socrates - THRASYMACHUS
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR>Never mind, I replied, if he now says that they are, let us accept 
<A NAME="607"></A>his statement. Tell me, Thrasymachus, I said, did you mean by justice what 
<A NAME="608"></A>the stronger thought to be his interest, whether really so or 
<A NAME="609"></A>not?
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not, he said. Do you suppose that I call him who is mistaken 
<A NAME="611"></A>the stronger at the time when he is mistaken?
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said, my impression was that you did so, when you admitted 
<A NAME="613"></A>that the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes 
<A NAME="614"></A>mistaken.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>You argue like an informer, Socrates. Do you mean, for example, 
<A NAME="616"></A>that he who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken? 
<A NAME="617"></A>or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or grammarian 
<A NAME="618"></A>at the me when he is making the mistake, in respect of the mistake? True, 
<A NAME="619"></A>we say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian has made a mistake, 
<A NAME="620"></A>but this is only a way of speaking; for the fact is that neither the grammarian 
<A NAME="621"></A>nor any other person of skill ever makes a mistake in so far as he is what 
<A NAME="622"></A>his name implies; they none of them err unless their skill fails them, 
<A NAME="623"></A>and then they cease to be skilled artists. No artist or sage or ruler errs 
<A NAME="624"></A>at the time when he is what his name implies; though he is commonly said 
<A NAME="625"></A>to err, and I adopted the common mode of speaking. But to be perfectly 
<A NAME="626"></A>accurate, since you are such a lover of accuracy, we should say that the 
<A NAME="627"></A>ruler, in so far as he is the ruler, is unerring, and, being unerring, 
<A NAME="628"></A>always commands that which is for his own interest; and the subject is 
<A NAME="629"></A>required to execute his commands; and therefore, as I said at first and 
<A NAME="630"></A>now repeat, justice is the interest of the stronger.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, Thrasymachus, and do I really appear to you to argue like 
<A NAME="632"></A>an informer?
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he replied.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>And you suppose that I ask these questions with any design of injuring 
<A NAME="635"></A>you in the argument?
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>Nay, he replied, 'suppose' is not the word --I know it; but you 
<A NAME="637"></A>will be found out, and by sheer force of argument you will never 
<A NAME="638"></A>prevail.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>I shall not make the attempt, my dear man; but to avoid any misunderstanding 
<A NAME="640"></A>occurring between us in future, let me ask, in what sense do you speak 
<A NAME="641"></A>of a ruler or stronger whose interest, as you were saying, he being the 
<A NAME="642"></A>superior, it is just that the inferior should execute --is he a ruler in 
<A NAME="643"></A>the popular or in the strict sense of the term?
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>In the strictest of all senses, he said. And now cheat and play 
<A NAME="645"></A>the informer if you can; I ask no quarter at your hands. But you never 
<A NAME="646"></A>will be able, never.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR>And do you imagine, I said, that I am such a madman as to try and 
<A NAME="648"></A>cheat, Thrasymachus? I might as well shave a lion.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>Why, he said, you made the attempt a minute ago, and you 
<A NAME="650"></A>failed.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>Enough, I said, of these civilities. It will be better that I should 
<A NAME="652"></A>ask you a question: Is the physician, taken in that strict sense of which 
<A NAME="653"></A>you are speaking, a healer of the sick or a maker of money? And remember 
<A NAME="654"></A>that I am now speaking of the true physician.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>A healer of the sick, he replied.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>And the pilot --that is to say, the true pilot --is he a captain of 
<A NAME="657"></A>sailors or a mere sailor?
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>A captain of sailors.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>The circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken into 
<A NAME="660"></A>account; neither is he to be called a sailor; the name pilot by which he 
<A NAME="661"></A>is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing, but is significant of 
<A NAME="662"></A>his skill and of his authority over the sailors.
<A NAME="663"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he said.
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>Now, I said, every art has an interest?
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>For which the art has to consider and provide?
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Yes, that is the aim of art.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>And the interest of any art is the perfection of it --this and nothing 
<A NAME="669"></A>else?
<A NAME="670"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean?
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>I mean what I may illustrate negatively by the example of the body. 
<A NAME="672"></A>Suppose you were to ask me whether the body is self-sufficing or has wants, 
<A NAME="673"></A>I should reply: Certainly the body has wants; for the body may be ill and 
<A NAME="674"></A>require to be cured, and has therefore interests to which the art of medicine 
<A NAME="675"></A>ministers; and this is the origin and intention of medicine, as you will 
<A NAME="676"></A>acknowledge. Am I not right?
<A NAME="677"></A><BR><BR>Quite right, he replied.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>But is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in 
<A NAME="679"></A>any quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight or the 
<A NAME="680"></A>ear fail of hearing, and therefore requires another art to provide for 
<A NAME="681"></A>the interests of seeing and hearing --has art in itself, I say, any similar 
<A NAME="682"></A>liability to fault or defect, and does every art require another supplementary 
<A NAME="683"></A>art to provide for its interests, and that another and another without 
<A NAME="684"></A>end? Or have the arts to look only after their own interests? Or have they 
<A NAME="685"></A>no need either of themselves or of another? --having no faults or defects, 
<A NAME="686"></A>they have no need to correct them, either by the exercise of their own 
<A NAME="687"></A>art or of any other; they have only to consider the interest of their subject-matter. 
<A NAME="688"></A>For every art remains pure and faultless while remaining true --that is 
<A NAME="689"></A>to say, while perfect and unimpaired. Take the words in your precise sense, 
<A NAME="690"></A>and tell me whether I am not right."
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>Yes, clearly.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>Then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine, but the interest 
<A NAME="693"></A>of the body?
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>Nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art 
<A NAME="696"></A>of horsemanship, but the interests of the horse; neither do any other arts 
<A NAME="697"></A>care for themselves, for they have no needs; they care only for that which 
<A NAME="698"></A>is the subject of their art?
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>But surely, Thrasymachus, the arts are the superiors and rulers of 
<A NAME="701"></A>their own subjects?
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>To this he assented with a good deal of reluctance.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>Then, I said, no science or art considers or enjoins the interest of 
<A NAME="704"></A>the stronger or superior, but only the interest of the subject and 
<A NAME="705"></A>weaker?
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR>He made an attempt to contest this proposition also, but finally 
<A NAME="707"></A>acquiesced.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>Then, I continued, no physician, in so far as he is a physician, 
<A NAME="709"></A>considers his own good in what he prescribes, but the good of his patient; 
<A NAME="710"></A>for the true physician is also a ruler having the human body as a subject, 
<A NAME="711"></A>and is not a mere money-maker; that has been admitted?
<A NAME="712"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>And the pilot likewise, in the strict sense of the term, is a ruler 
<A NAME="714"></A>of sailors and not a mere sailor?
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>That has been admitted.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>And such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for the interest 
<A NAME="717"></A>of the sailor who is under him, and not for his own or the ruler's 
<A NAME="718"></A>interest?
<A NAME="719"></A><BR><BR>He gave a reluctant 'Yes.'
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>Then, I said, Thrasymachus, there is no one in any rule who, in so 
<A NAME="721"></A>far as he is a ruler, considers or enjoins what is for his own interest, 
<A NAME="722"></A>but always what is for the interest of his subject or suitable to his art; 
<A NAME="723"></A>to that he looks, and that alone he considers in everything which he says 
<A NAME="724"></A>and does.
<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR>When we had got to this point in the argument, and every one saw 
<A NAME="726"></A>that the definition of justice had been completely upset, Thrasymachus, 
<A NAME="727"></A>instead of replying to me, said: Tell me, Socrates, have you got a 
<A NAME="728"></A>nurse?
<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>Why do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to 
<A NAME="730"></A>be answering?
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>Because she leaves you to snivel, and never wipes your nose: she 
<A NAME="732"></A>has not even taught you to know the shepherd from the 
<A NAME="733"></A>sheep.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR>What makes you say that? I replied.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens of tends the 
<A NAME="736"></A>sheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good of himself 
<A NAME="737"></A>or his master; and you further imagine that the rulers of states, if they 
<A NAME="738"></A>are true rulers, never think of their subjects as sheep, and that they 
<A NAME="739"></A>are not studying their own advantage day and night. Oh, no; and so entirely 
<A NAME="740"></A>astray are you in your ideas about the just and unjust as not even to know 
<A NAME="741"></A>that justice and the just are in reality another's good; that is to say, 
<A NAME="742"></A>the interest of the ruler and stronger, and the loss of the subject and 
<A NAME="743"></A>servant; and injustice the opposite; for the unjust is lord over the truly 
<A NAME="744"></A>simple and just: he is the stronger, and his subjects do what is for his 
<A NAME="745"></A>interest, and minister to his happiness, which is very far from being their 
<A NAME="746"></A>own. Consider further, most foolish Socrates, that the just is always a 
<A NAME="747"></A>loser in comparison with the unjust. First of all, in private contracts: 
<A NAME="748"></A>wherever the unjust is the partner of the just you will find that, when 
<A NAME="749"></A>the partnership is dissolved, the unjust man has always more and the just 
<A NAME="750"></A>less. Secondly, in their dealings with the State: when there is an income 
<A NAME="751"></A>tax, the just man will pay more and the unjust less on the same amount 
<A NAME="752"></A>of income; and when there is anything to be received the one gains nothing 
<A NAME="753"></A>and the other much. Observe also what happens when they take an office; 
<A NAME="754"></A>there is the just man neglecting his affairs and perhaps suffering other 
<A NAME="755"></A>losses, and getting nothing out of the public, because he is just; moreover 
<A NAME="756"></A>he is hated by his friends and acquaintance for refusing to serve them 
<A NAME="757"></A>in unlawful ways. But all this is reversed in the case of the unjust man. 
<A NAME="758"></A>I am speaking, as before, of injustice on a large scale in which the advantage 
<A NAME="759"></A>of the unjust is more apparent; and my meaning will be most clearly seen 
<A NAME="760"></A>if we turn to that highest form of injustice in which the criminal is the 
<A NAME="761"></A>happiest of men, and the sufferers or those who refuse to do injustice 
<A NAME="762"></A>are the most miserable --that is to say tyranny, which by fraud and force 
<A NAME="763"></A>takes away the property of others, not little by little but wholesale; 
<A NAME="764"></A>comprehending in one, things sacred as well as profane, private and public; 
<A NAME="765"></A>for which acts of wrong, if he were detected perpetrating any one of them 
<A NAME="766"></A>singly, he would be punished and incur great disgrace --they who do such 
<A NAME="767"></A>wrong in particular cases are called robbers of temples, and man-stealers 
<A NAME="768"></A>and burglars and swindlers and thieves. But when a man besides taking away 
<A NAME="769"></A>the money of the citizens has made slaves of them, then, instead of these 
<A NAME="770"></A>names of reproach, he is termed happy and blessed, not only by the citizens 
<A NAME="771"></A>but by all who hear of his having achieved the consummation of injustice. 
<A NAME="772"></A>For mankind censure injustice, fearing that they may be the victims of 
<A NAME="773"></A>it and not because they shrink from committing it. And thus, as I have 
<A NAME="774"></A>shown, Socrates, injustice, when on a sufficient scale, has more strength 
<A NAME="775"></A>and freedom and mastery than justice; and, as I said at first, justice 
<A NAME="776"></A>is the interest of the stronger, whereas injustice is a man's own profit 
<A NAME="777"></A>and interest.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR>Thrasymachus, when he had thus spoken, having, like a bathman, 
<A NAME="779"></A>deluged our ears with his words, had a mind to go away. But the company 
<A NAME="780"></A>would not let him; they insisted that he should remain and defend his position; 
<A NAME="781"></A>and I myself added my own humble request that he would not leave us. Thrasymachus, 
<A NAME="782"></A>I said to him, excellent man, how suggestive are your remarks! And are 
<A NAME="783"></A>you going to run away before you have fairly taught or learned whether 
<A NAME="784"></A>they are true or not? Is the attempt to determine the way of man's life 
<A NAME="785"></A>so small a matter in your eyes --to determine how life may be passed by 
<A NAME="786"></A>each one of us to the greatest advantage?
<A NAME="787"></A><BR><BR>And do I differ from you, he said, as to the importance of the 
<A NAME="788"></A>enquiry?
<A NAME="789"></A><BR><BR>You appear rather, I replied, to have no care or thought about 
<A NAME="790"></A>us, Thrasymachus --whether we live better or worse from not knowing what 
<A NAME="791"></A>you say you know, is to you a matter of indifference. Prithee, friend, 
<A NAME="792"></A>do not keep your knowledge to yourself; we are a large party; and any benefit 
<A NAME="793"></A>which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded. For my own part I openly 
<A NAME="794"></A>declare that I am not convinced, and that I do not believe injustice to 
<A NAME="795"></A>be more gainful than justice, even if uncontrolled and allowed to have 
<A NAME="796"></A>free play. For, granting that there may be an unjust man who is able to 
<A NAME="797"></A>commit injustice either by fraud or force, still this does not convince 
<A NAME="798"></A>me of the superior advantage of injustice, and there may be others who 
<A NAME="799"></A>are in the same predicament with myself. Perhaps we may be wrong; if so, 
<A NAME="800"></A>you in your wisdom should convince us that we are mistaken in preferring 
<A NAME="801"></A>justice to injustice.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>And how am I to convince you, he said, if you are not already convinced 
<A NAME="803"></A>by what I have just said; what more can I do for you? Would you have me 
<A NAME="804"></A>put the proof bodily into your souls?
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>Heaven forbid! I said; I would only ask you to be consistent; or, 
<A NAME="806"></A>if you change, change openly and let there be no deception. For I must 
<A NAME="807"></A>remark, Thrasymachus, if you will recall what was previously said, that 
<A NAME="808"></A>although you began by defining the true physician in an exact sense, you 
<A NAME="809"></A>did not observe a like exactness when speaking of the shepherd; you thought 
<A NAME="810"></A>that the shepherd as a shepherd tends the sheep not with a view to their 
<A NAME="811"></A>own good, but like a mere diner or banqueter with a view to the pleasures 
<A NAME="812"></A>of the table; or, again, as a trader for sale in the market, and not as 
<A NAME="813"></A>a shepherd. Yet surely the art of the shepherd is concerned only with the 
<A NAME="814"></A>good of his subjects; he has only to provide the best for them, since the 
<A NAME="815"></A>perfection of the art is already ensured whenever all the requirements 
<A NAME="816"></A>of it are satisfied. And that was what I was saying just now about the 
<A NAME="817"></A>ruler. I conceived that the art of the ruler, considered as ruler, whether 
<A NAME="818"></A>in a state or in private life, could only regard the good of his flock 
<A NAME="819"></A>or subjects; whereas you seem to think that the rulers in states, that 
<A NAME="820"></A>is to say, the true rulers, like being in authority.
<A NAME="821"></A><BR><BR>Think! Nay, I am sure of it.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>Then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them willingly 
<A NAME="823"></A>without payment, unless under the idea that they govern for the advantage 
<A NAME="824"></A>not of themselves but of others? Let me ask you a question: Are not the 
<A NAME="825"></A>several arts different, by reason of their each having a separate function? 
<A NAME="826"></A>And, my dear illustrious friend, do say what you think, that we may make 
<A NAME="827"></A>a little progress.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that is the difference, he replied.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>And each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general one 
<A NAME="830"></A>--medicine, for example, gives us health; navigation, safety at sea, and 
<A NAME="831"></A>so on?
<A NAME="832"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>And the art of payment has the special function of giving pay: but 
<A NAME="834"></A>we do not confuse this with other arts, any more than the art of the pilot 
<A NAME="835"></A>is to be confused with the art of medicine, because the health of the pilot 
<A NAME="836"></A>may be improved by a sea voyage. You would not be inclined to say, would 
<A NAME="837"></A>you, that navigation is the art of medicine, at least if we are to adopt 
<A NAME="838"></A>your exact use of language?
<A NAME="839"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not 
<A NAME="841"></A>say that the art of payment is medicine?
<A NAME="842"></A><BR><BR>I should say not.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>Nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because 
<A NAME="844"></A>a man takes fees when he is engaged in healing?
<A NAME="845"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>And we have admitted, I said, that the good of each art is specially 
<A NAME="847"></A>confined to the art?
<A NAME="848"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>Then, if there be any good which all artists have in common, that is 
<A NAME="850"></A>to be attributed to something of which they all have the common 
<A NAME="851"></A>use?
<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR>True, he replied.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>And when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is 
<A NAME="854"></A>gained by an additional use of the art of pay, which is not the art professed 
<A NAME="855"></A>by him?
<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR>He gave a reluctant assent to this.
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>Then the pay is not derived by the several artists from their respective 
<A NAME="858"></A>arts. But the truth is, that while the art of medicine gives health, and 
<A NAME="859"></A>the art of the builder builds a house, another art attends them which is 
<A NAME="860"></A>the art of pay. The various arts may be doing their own business and benefiting 
<A NAME="861"></A>that over which they preside, but would the artist receive any benefit 
<A NAME="862"></A>from his art unless he were paid as well?
<A NAME="863"></A><BR><BR>I suppose not.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>But does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for 
<A NAME="865"></A>nothing?
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>Certainly, he confers a benefit.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>Then now, Thrasymachus, there is no longer any doubt that neither arts 
<A NAME="868"></A>nor governments provide for their own interests; but, as we were before 
<A NAME="869"></A>saying, they rule and provide for the interests of their subjects who are 
<A NAME="870"></A>the weaker and not the stronger --to their good they attend and not to 
<A NAME="871"></A>the good of the superior.
<A NAME="872"></A><BR><BR>And this is the reason, my dear Thrasymachus, why, as I was just 
<A NAME="873"></A>now saying, no one is willing to govern; because no one likes to take in 
<A NAME="874"></A>hand the reformation of evils which are not his concern without remuneration. 
<A NAME="875"></A>For, in the execution of his work, and in giving his orders to another, 
<A NAME="876"></A>the true artist does not regard his own interest, but always that of his 
<A NAME="877"></A>subjects; and therefore in order that rulers may be willing to rule, they 
<A NAME="878"></A>must be paid in one of three modes of payment: money, or honour, or a penalty 
<A NAME="879"></A>for refusing.
<A NAME="880"></A><BR><BR>Socrates - GLAUCON
<A NAME="881"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean, Socrates? said Glaucon. The first two modes of 
<A NAME="882"></A>payment are intelligible enough, but what the penalty is I do not understand, 
<A NAME="883"></A>or how a penalty can be a payment.
<A NAME="884"></A><BR><BR>You mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment 
<A NAME="885"></A>which to the best men is the great inducement to rule? Of course you know 
<A NAME="886"></A>that ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a 
<A NAME="887"></A>disgrace?
<A NAME="888"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>And for this reason, I said, money and honour have no attraction for 
<A NAME="890"></A>them; good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing 
<A NAME="891"></A>and so to get the name of hirelings, nor by secretly helping themselves 
<A NAME="892"></A>out of the public revenues to get the name of thieves. And not being ambitious 
<A NAME="893"></A>they do not care about honour. Wherefore necessity must be laid upon them, 
<A NAME="894"></A>and they must be induced to serve from the fear of punishment. And this, 
<A NAME="895"></A>as I imagine, is the reason why the forwardness to take office, instead 
<A NAME="896"></A>of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed dishonourable. Now the worst 
<A NAME="897"></A>part of the punishment is that he who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled 
<A NAME="898"></A>by one who is worse than himself. And the fear of this, as I conceive, 
<A NAME="899"></A>induces the good to take office, not because they would, but because they 
<A NAME="900"></A>cannot help --not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit 
<A NAME="901"></A>or enjoyment themselves, but as a necessity, and because they are not able 
<A NAME="902"></A>to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better than themselves, 
<A NAME="903"></A>or indeed as good. For there is reason to think that if a city were composed 
<A NAME="904"></A>entirely of good men, then to avoid office would be as much an object of 
<A NAME="905"></A>contention as to obtain office is at present; then we should have plain 
<A NAME="906"></A>proof that the true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest, 
<A NAME="907"></A>but that of his subjects; and every one who knew this would choose rather 
<A NAME="908"></A>to receive a benefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring 
<A NAME="909"></A>one. So far am I from agreeing with Thrasymachus that justice is the interest 
<A NAME="910"></A>of the stronger. This latter question need not be further discussed at 
<A NAME="911"></A>present; but when Thrasymachus says that the life of the unjust is more 
<A NAME="912"></A>advantageous than that of the just, his new statement appears to me to 
<A NAME="913"></A>be of a far more serious character. Which of us has spoken truly? And which 
<A NAME="914"></A>sort of life, Glaucon, do you prefer?
<A NAME="915"></A><BR><BR>I for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous, 
<A NAME="916"></A>he answered.
<A NAME="917"></A><BR><BR>Did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which Thrasymachus 
<A NAME="918"></A>was rehearsing?
<A NAME="919"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I heard him, he replied, but he has not convinced 
<A NAME="920"></A>me.
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>Then shall we try to find some way of convincing him, if we can, that 
<A NAME="922"></A>he is saying what is not true?
<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR>Most certainly, he replied.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>If, I said, he makes a set speech and we make another recounting all 
<A NAME="925"></A>the advantages of being just, and he answers and we rejoin, there must 
<A NAME="926"></A>be a numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed on either side, 
<A NAME="927"></A>and in the end we shall want judges to decide; but if we proceed in our 
<A NAME="928"></A>enquiry as we lately did, by making admissions to one another, we shall 
<A NAME="929"></A>unite the offices of judge and advocate in our own persons.
<A NAME="930"></A><BR><BR>Very good, he said.
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>And which method do I understand you to prefer? I 
<A NAME="932"></A>said.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>That which you propose.
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>Well, then, Thrasymachus, I said, suppose you begin at the beginning 
<A NAME="935"></A>and answer me. You say that perfect injustice is more gainful than perfect 
<A NAME="936"></A>justice?
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR>Socrates - GLAUCON - THRASYMACHUS
<A NAME="938"></A><BR><BR>Yes, that is what I say, and I have given you my 
<A NAME="939"></A>reasons.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>And what is your view about them? Would you call one of them virtue 
<A NAME="941"></A>and the other vice?
<A NAME="942"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>I suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice 
<A NAME="944"></A>vice?
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>What a charming notion! So likely too, seeing that I affirm injustice 
<A NAME="946"></A>to be profitable and justice not.
<A NAME="947"></A><BR><BR>What else then would you say?
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>The opposite, he replied.
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>And would you call justice vice?
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>No, I would rather say sublime simplicity.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>Then would you call injustice malignity?
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>No; I would rather say discretion.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>And do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good?
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>Yes, he said; at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly 
<A NAME="955"></A>unjust, and who have the power of subduing states and nations; but perhaps 
<A NAME="956"></A>you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses.
<A NAME="957"></A><BR><BR>Even this profession if undetected has advantages, though they 
<A NAME="958"></A>are not to be compared with those of which I was just now 
<A NAME="959"></A>speaking.
<A NAME="960"></A><BR><BR>I do not think that I misapprehend your meaning, Thrasymachus, 
<A NAME="961"></A>I replied; but still I cannot hear without amazement that you class injustice 
<A NAME="962"></A>with wisdom and virtue, and justice with the opposite.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR><BR>Certainly I do so class them.
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>Now, I said, you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable ground; 
<A NAME="965"></A>for if the injustice which you were maintaining to be profitable had been 
<A NAME="966"></A>admitted by you as by others to be vice and deformity, an answer might 
<A NAME="967"></A>have been given to you on received principles; but now I perceive that 
<A NAME="968"></A>you will call injustice honourable and strong, and to the unjust you will 
<A NAME="969"></A>attribute all the qualities which were attributed by us before to the just, 
<A NAME="970"></A>seeing that you do not hesitate to rank injustice with wisdom and 
<A NAME="971"></A>virtue.
<A NAME="972"></A><BR><BR>You have guessed most infallibly, he replied.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>Then I certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the argument 
<A NAME="974"></A>so long as I have reason to think that you, Thrasymachus, are speaking 
<A NAME="975"></A>your real mind; for I do believe that you are now in earnest and are not 
<A NAME="976"></A>amusing yourself at our expense.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR><BR>I may be in earnest or not, but what is that to you? --to refute 
<A NAME="978"></A>the argument is your business.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR><BR>Very true, I said; that is what I have to do: But will you be so 
<A NAME="980"></A>good as answer yet one more question? Does the just man try to gain any 
<A NAME="981"></A>advantage over the just?
<A NAME="982"></A><BR><BR>Far otherwise; if he did would not be the simple, amusing creature 
<A NAME="983"></A>which he is.
<A NAME="984"></A><BR><BR>And would he try to go beyond just action?
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>He would not.
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>And how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the unjust; 
<A NAME="987"></A>would that be considered by him as just or unjust?
<A NAME="988"></A><BR><BR>He would think it just, and would try to gain the advantage; but 
<A NAME="989"></A>he would not be able.
<A NAME="990"></A><BR><BR>Whether he would or would not be able, I said, is not to the point. 
<A NAME="991"></A>My question is only whether the just man, while refusing to have more than 
<A NAME="992"></A>another just man, would wish and claim to have more than the 
<A NAME="993"></A>unjust?
<A NAME="994"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he would.
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>And what of the unjust --does he claim to have more than the just man 
<A NAME="996"></A>and to do more than is just
<A NAME="997"></A><BR><BR>Of course, he said, for he claims to have more than all 
<A NAME="998"></A>men.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>And the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the 
<A NAME="1000"></A>unjust man or action, in order that he may have more than 
<A NAME="1001"></A>all?
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>We may put the matter thus, I said --the just does not desire more 
<A NAME="1004"></A>than his like but more than his unlike, whereas the unjust desires more 
<A NAME="1005"></A>than both his like and his unlike?
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR><BR>Nothing, he said, can be better than that statement.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>And the unjust is good and wise, and the just is 
<A NAME="1008"></A>neither?
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>Good again, he said.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>And is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike 
<A NAME="1011"></A>them?
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR><BR>Of course, he said, he who is of a certain nature, is like those 
<A NAME="1013"></A>who are of a certain nature; he who is not, not.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>Each of them, I said, is such as his like is?
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>Certainly, he replied.
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>Very good, Thrasymachus, I said; and now to take the case of the arts: 
<A NAME="1017"></A>you would admit that one man is a musician and another not a 
<A NAME="1018"></A>musician?
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>And which is wise and which is foolish?
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>Clearly the musician is wise, and he who is not a musician is 
<A NAME="1022"></A>foolish.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR><BR>And he is good in as far as he is wise, and bad in as far as he 
<A NAME="1024"></A>is foolish?
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>And you would say the same sort of thing of the 
<A NAME="1027"></A>physician?
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>And do you think, my excellent friend, that a musician when he adjusts 
<A NAME="1030"></A>the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the 
<A NAME="1031"></A>tightening and loosening the strings?
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR><BR>I do not think that he would.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>But he would claim to exceed the non-musician?
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>And what would you say of the physician? In prescribing meats and drinks 
<A NAME="1036"></A>would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the practice of 
<A NAME="1037"></A>medicine?
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR><BR>He would not.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>But he would wish to go beyond the non-physician?
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>And about knowledge and ignorance in general; see whether you think 
<A NAME="1042"></A>that any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have the choice of saying 
<A NAME="1043"></A>or doing more than another man who has knowledge. Would he not rather say 
<A NAME="1044"></A>or do the same as his like in the same case?
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR><BR>That, I suppose, can hardly be denied.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>And what of the ignorant? would he not desire to have more than either 
<A NAME="1047"></A>the knowing or the ignorant?
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR><BR>I dare say.
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>And the knowing is wise?
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>And the wise is good?
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>Then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his like, 
<A NAME="1054"></A>but more than his unlike and opposite?
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR><BR>I suppose so.
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>Whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than 
<A NAME="1057"></A>both?
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>But did we not say, Thrasymachus, that the unjust goes beyond both 
<A NAME="1060"></A>his like and unlike? Were not these your words? They 
<A NAME="1061"></A>were.
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR><BR>They were.
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>And you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like but his 
<A NAME="1064"></A>unlike?
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>Then the just is like the wise and good, and the unjust like the evil 
<A NAME="1067"></A>and ignorant?
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR><BR>That is the inference.
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>And each of them is such as his like is?
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>That was admitted.
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>Then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust evil 
<A NAME="1072"></A>and ignorant.
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR><BR>Thrasymachus made all these admissions, not fluently, as I repeat 
<A NAME="1074"></A>them, but with extreme reluctance; it was a hot summer's day, and the perspiration 
<A NAME="1075"></A>poured from him in torrents; and then I saw what I had never seen before, 
<A NAME="1076"></A>Thrasymachus blushing. As we were now agreed that justice was virtue and 
<A NAME="1077"></A>wisdom, and injustice vice and ignorance, I proceeded to another 
<A NAME="1078"></A>point:
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR><BR>Well, I said, Thrasymachus, that matter is now settled; but were 
<A NAME="1080"></A>we not also saying that injustice had strength; do you 
<A NAME="1081"></A>remember?
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I remember, he said, but do not suppose that I approve of 
<A NAME="1083"></A>what you are saying or have no answer; if however I were to answer, you 
<A NAME="1084"></A>would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing; therefore either permit 
<A NAME="1085"></A>me to have my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and I will answer 
<A NAME="1086"></A>'Very good,' as they say to story-telling old women, and will nod 'Yes' 
<A NAME="1087"></A>and 'No.'
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not, I said, if contrary to your real 
<A NAME="1089"></A>opinion.
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>Yes, he said, I will, to please you, since you will not let me speak. 
<A NAME="1091"></A>What else would you have?
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR><BR>Nothing in the world, I said; and if you are so disposed I will 
<A NAME="1093"></A>ask and you shall answer.
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR><BR>Proceed.
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>Then I will repeat the question which I asked before, in order that 
<A NAME="1096"></A>our examination of the relative nature of justice and injustice may be 
<A NAME="1097"></A>carried on regularly. A statement was made that injustice is stronger and 
<A NAME="1098"></A>more powerful than justice, but now justice, having been identified with 
<A NAME="1099"></A>wisdom and virtue, is easily shown to be stronger than injustice, if injustice 
<A NAME="1100"></A>is ignorance; this can no longer be questioned by any one. But I want to 
<A NAME="1101"></A>view the matter, Thrasymachus, in a different way: You would not deny that 
<A NAME="1102"></A>a state may be unjust and may be unjustly attempting to enslave other states, 
<A NAME="1103"></A>or may have already enslaved them, and may be holding many of them in 
<A NAME="1104"></A>subjection?
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR><BR>True, he replied; and I will add the best and perfectly unjust 
<A NAME="1106"></A>state will be most likely to do so.
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR><BR>I know, I said, that such was your position; but what I would further 
<A NAME="1108"></A>consider is, whether this power which is possessed by the superior state 
<A NAME="1109"></A>can exist or be exercised without justice.
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR><BR>If you are right in you view, and justice is wisdom, then only 
<A NAME="1111"></A>with justice; but if I am right, then without justice.
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR><BR>I am delighted, Thrasymachus, to see you not only nodding assent 
<A NAME="1113"></A>and dissent, but making answers which are quite excellent.
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR><BR>That is out of civility to you, he replied.
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>You are very kind, I said; and would you have the goodness also to 
<A NAME="1116"></A>inform me, whether you think that a state, or an army, or a band of robbers 
<A NAME="1117"></A>and thieves, or any other gang of evil-doers could act at all if they injured 
<A NAME="1118"></A>one another?
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR><BR>No indeed, he said, they could not.
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>But if they abstained from injuring one another, then they might act 
<A NAME="1121"></A>together better?
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>And this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and fighting, 
<A NAME="1124"></A>and justice imparts harmony and friendship; is not that true, 
<A NAME="1125"></A>Thrasymachus?
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR><BR>I agree, he said, because I do not wish to quarrel with 
<A NAME="1127"></A>you.
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>How good of you, I said; but I should like to know also whether injustice, 
<A NAME="1129"></A>having this tendency to arouse hatred, wherever existing, among slaves 
<A NAME="1130"></A>or among freemen, will not make them hate one another and set them at variance 
<A NAME="1131"></A>and render them incapable of common action?
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>And even if injustice be found in two only, will they not quarrel and 
<A NAME="1134"></A>fight, and become enemies to one another and to the 
<A NAME="1135"></A>just
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR><BR>They will.
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>And suppose injustice abiding in a single person, would your wisdom 
<A NAME="1138"></A>say that she loses or that she retains her natural power?
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR><BR>Let us assume that she retains her power.
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>Yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that 
<A NAME="1141"></A>wherever she takes up her abode, whether in a city, in an army, in a family, 
<A NAME="1142"></A>or in any other body, that body is, to begin with, rendered incapable of 
<A NAME="1143"></A>united action by reason of sedition and distraction; and does it not become 
<A NAME="1144"></A>its own enemy and at variance with all that opposes it, and with the just? 
<A NAME="1145"></A>Is not this the case?
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR><BR>Yes, certainly.
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>And is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single person; 
<A NAME="1148"></A>in the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is not 
<A NAME="1149"></A>at unity with himself, and in the second place making him an enemy to himself 
<A NAME="1150"></A>and the just? Is not that true, Thrasymachus?
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR>And O my friend, I said, surely the gods are just?
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR>Granted that they are.
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR>But if so, the unjust will be the enemy of the gods, and the just will 
<A NAME="1155"></A>be their friend?
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR><BR>Feast away in triumph, and take your fill of the argument; I will 
<A NAME="1157"></A>not oppose you, lest I should displease the company.
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR><BR>Well then, proceed with your answers, and let me have the remainder 
<A NAME="1159"></A>of my repast. For we have already shown that the just are clearly wiser 
<A NAME="1160"></A>and better and abler than the unjust, and that the unjust are incapable 
<A NAME="1161"></A>of common action; nay ing at more, that to speak as we did of men who are 
<A NAME="1162"></A>evil acting at any time vigorously together, is not strictly true, for 
<A NAME="1163"></A>if they had been perfectly evil, they would have laid hands upon one another; 
<A NAME="1164"></A>but it is evident that there must have been some remnant of justice in 
<A NAME="1165"></A>them, which enabled them to combine; if there had not been they would have 
<A NAME="1166"></A>injured one another as well as their victims; they were but half --villains 
<A NAME="1167"></A>in their enterprises; for had they been whole villains, and utterly unjust, 
<A NAME="1168"></A>they would have been utterly incapable of action. That, as I believe, is 
<A NAME="1169"></A>the truth of the matter, and not what you said at first. But whether the 
<A NAME="1170"></A>just have a better and happier life than the unjust is a further question 
<A NAME="1171"></A>which we also proposed to consider. I think that they have, and for the 
<A NAME="1172"></A>reasons which to have given; but still I should like to examine further, 
<A NAME="1173"></A>for no light matter is at stake, nothing less than the rule of human 
<A NAME="1174"></A>life.
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR><BR>Proceed.
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR>I will proceed by asking a question: Would you not say that a horse 
<A NAME="1177"></A>has some end?
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR><BR>I should.
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR>And the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could 
<A NAME="1180"></A>not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other 
<A NAME="1181"></A>thing?
<A NAME="1182"></A><BR><BR>I do not understand, he said.
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR>Let me explain: Can you see, except with the eye?
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR>Or hear, except with the ear?
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>No.
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR>These then may be truly said to be the ends of these 
<A NAME="1188"></A>organs?
<A NAME="1189"></A><BR>They may.
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR>But you can cut off a vine-branch with a dagger or with a chisel, and 
<A NAME="1191"></A>in many other ways?
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="1193"></A><BR>And yet not so well as with a pruning-hook made for the 
<A NAME="1194"></A>purpose?
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR>May we not say that this is the end of a pruning-hook?
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR>We may.
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR>Then now I think you will have no difficulty in understanding my meaning 
<A NAME="1199"></A>when I asked the question whether the end of anything would be that which 
<A NAME="1200"></A>could not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other 
<A NAME="1201"></A>thing?
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR><BR>I understand your meaning, he said, and assent.
<A NAME="1203"></A><BR>And that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence? Need 
<A NAME="1204"></A>I ask again whether the eye has an end?
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR><BR>It has.
<A NAME="1206"></A><BR>And has not the eye an excellence?
<A NAME="1207"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1208"></A><BR>And the ear has an end and an excellence also?
<A NAME="1209"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="1210"></A><BR>And the same is true of all other things; they have each of them an 
<A NAME="1211"></A>end and a special excellence?
<A NAME="1212"></A><BR><BR>That is so.
<A NAME="1213"></A><BR>Well, and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in their 
<A NAME="1214"></A>own proper excellence and have a defect instead?
<A NAME="1215"></A><BR><BR>How can they, he said, if they are blind and cannot 
<A NAME="1216"></A>see?
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR>You mean to say, if they have lost their proper excellence, which is 
<A NAME="1218"></A>sight; but I have not arrived at that point yet. I would rather ask the 
<A NAME="1219"></A>question more generally, and only enquire whether the things which fulfil 
<A NAME="1220"></A>their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence, and fall of fulfilling 
<A NAME="1221"></A>them by their own defect?
<A NAME="1222"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he replied.
<A NAME="1223"></A><BR>I might say the same of the ears; when deprived of their own proper 
<A NAME="1224"></A>excellence they cannot fulfil their end?
<A NAME="1225"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1226"></A><BR>And the same observation will apply to all other 
<A NAME="1227"></A>things?
<A NAME="1228"></A><BR>I agree.
<A NAME="1229"></A><BR>Well; and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil? for 
<A NAME="1230"></A>example, to superintend and command and deliberate and the like. Are not 
<A NAME="1231"></A>these functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be assigned to 
<A NAME="1232"></A>any other?
<A NAME="1233"></A><BR><BR>To no other.
<A NAME="1234"></A><BR>And is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the 
<A NAME="1235"></A>soul?
<A NAME="1236"></A><BR>Assuredly, he said.
<A NAME="1237"></A><BR>And has not the soul an excellence also?
<A NAME="1238"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1239"></A><BR>And can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of that 
<A NAME="1240"></A>excellence?
<A NAME="1241"></A><BR><BR>She cannot.
<A NAME="1242"></A><BR>Then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and superintendent, 
<A NAME="1243"></A>and the good soul a good ruler?
<A NAME="1244"></A><BR><BR>Yes, necessarily.
<A NAME="1245"></A><BR>And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and 
<A NAME="1246"></A>injustice the defect of the soul?
<A NAME="1247"></A><BR><BR>That has been admitted.
<A NAME="1248"></A><BR>Then the just soul and the just man will live well, and the unjust 
<A NAME="1249"></A>man will live ill?
<A NAME="1250"></A><BR><BR>That is what your argument proves.
<A NAME="1251"></A><BR>And he who lives well is blessed and happy, and he who lives ill the 
<A NAME="1252"></A>reverse of happy?
<A NAME="1253"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1254"></A><BR>Then the just is happy, and the unjust miserable?
<A NAME="1255"></A><BR>So be it.
<A NAME="1256"></A><BR>But happiness and not misery is profitable.
<A NAME="1257"></A><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="1258"></A><BR>Then, my blessed Thrasymachus, injustice can never be more profitable 
<A NAME="1259"></A>than justice.
<A NAME="1260"></A><BR><BR>Let this, Socrates, he said, be your entertainment at the 
<A NAME="1261"></A>Bendidea.
<A NAME="1262"></A><BR>For which I am indebted to you, I said, now that you have grown gentle 
<A NAME="1263"></A>towards me and have left off scolding. Nevertheless, I have not been well 
<A NAME="1264"></A>entertained; but that was my own fault and not yours. As an epicure snatches 
<A NAME="1265"></A>a taste of every dish which is successively brought to table, he not having 
<A NAME="1266"></A>allowed himself time to enjoy the one before, so have I gone from one subject 
<A NAME="1267"></A>to another without having discovered what I sought at first, the nature 
<A NAME="1268"></A>of justice. I left that enquiry and turned away to consider whether justice 
<A NAME="1269"></A>is virtue and wisdom or evil and folly; and when there arose a further 
<A NAME="1270"></A>question about the comparative advantages of justice and injustice, I could 
<A NAME="1271"></A>not refrain from passing on to that. And the result of the whole discussion 
<A NAME="1272"></A>has been that I know nothing at all. For I know not what justice is, and 
<A NAME="1273"></A>therefore I am not likely to know whether it is or is not a virtue, nor 
<A NAME="1274"></A>can I say whether the just man is happy or unhappy.
