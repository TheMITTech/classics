<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Socrates - ADEIMANTUS
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Such then, I said, are our principles of theology --some tales 
<A NAME="12"></A>are to be told, and others are not to be told to our disciples from their 
<A NAME="13"></A>youth upwards, if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents, and 
<A NAME="14"></A>to value friendship with one another.
<A NAME="15"></A><BR><BR>Yes; and I think that our principles are right, he 
<A NAME="16"></A>said.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>But if they are to be courageous, must they not learn other lessons 
<A NAME="18"></A>besides these, and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of 
<A NAME="19"></A>death? Can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in 
<A NAME="20"></A>him?
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not, he said.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>And can he be fearless of death, or will he choose death in battle 
<A NAME="23"></A>rather than defeat and slavery, who believes the world below to be real 
<A NAME="24"></A>and terrible?
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>Impossible.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Then we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of tales 
<A NAME="27"></A>as well as over the others, and beg them not simply to but rather to commend 
<A NAME="28"></A>the world below, intimating to them that their descriptions are untrue, 
<A NAME="29"></A>and will do harm to our future warriors.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>That will be our duty, he said.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Then, I said, we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages, 
<A NAME="32"></A>beginning with the verses,
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>I would rather he a serf on the land of a poor and portionless 
<A NAME="34"></A>man than rule over all the dead who have come to nought. We must also expunge 
<A NAME="35"></A>the verse, which tells us how Pluto feared,
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>Lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should 
<A NAME="37"></A>he seen both of mortals and immortals. And again:
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>O heavens! verily in the house of Hades there is soul and ghostly 
<A NAME="39"></A>form but no mind at all! Again of Tiresias: --
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>[To him even after death did Persephone grant mind,] that he alone 
<A NAME="41"></A>should be wise; but the other souls are flitting shades. Again: 
<A NAME="42"></A>--
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>The soul flying from the limbs had gone to Hades, lamentng her 
<A NAME="44"></A>fate, leaving manhood and youth. Again: --
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>And the soul, with shrilling cry, passed like smoke beneath the 
<A NAME="46"></A>earth. And, --
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>As bats in hollow of mystic cavern, whenever any of the has dropped 
<A NAME="48"></A>out of the string and falls from the rock, fly shrilling and cling to one 
<A NAME="49"></A>another, so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they moved. And 
<A NAME="50"></A>we must beg Homer and the other poets not to be angry if we strike out 
<A NAME="51"></A>these and similar passages, not because they are unpoetical, or unattractive 
<A NAME="52"></A>to the popular ear, but because the greater the poetical charm of them, 
<A NAME="53"></A>the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men who are meant to be 
<A NAME="54"></A>free, and who should fear slavery more than death.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>Undoubtedly.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Also we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names describe 
<A NAME="57"></A>the world below --Cocytus and Styx, ghosts under the earth, and sapless 
<A NAME="58"></A>shades, and any similar words of which the very mention causes a shudder 
<A NAME="59"></A>to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears them. I do not say that 
<A NAME="60"></A>these horrible stories may not have a use of some kind; but there is a 
<A NAME="61"></A>danger that the nerves of our guardians may be rendered too excitable and 
<A NAME="62"></A>effeminate by them.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>There is a real danger, he said.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Then we must have no more of them.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Another and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by 
<A NAME="67"></A>us.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>And shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous 
<A NAME="70"></A>men?
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>They will go with the rest.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>But shall we be right in getting rid of them? Reflect: our principle 
<A NAME="73"></A>is that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good 
<A NAME="74"></A>man who is his comrade.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>Yes; that is our principle.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>And therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though 
<A NAME="77"></A>he had suffered anything terrible?
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>He will not.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Such an one, as we further maintain, is sufficient for himself and 
<A NAME="80"></A>his own happiness, and therefore is least in need of other 
<A NAME="81"></A>men.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>And for this reason the loss of a son or brother, or the deprivation 
<A NAME="84"></A>of fortune, is to him of all men least terrible.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>Assuredly.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>And therefore he will be least likely to lament, and will bear with 
<A NAME="87"></A>the greatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall 
<A NAME="88"></A>him.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he will feel such a misfortune far less than 
<A NAME="90"></A>another.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Then we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous 
<A NAME="92"></A>men, and making them over to women (and not even to women who are good 
<A NAME="93"></A>for anything), or to men of a baser sort, that those who are being educated 
<A NAME="94"></A>by us to be the defenders of their country may scorn to do the 
<A NAME="95"></A>like.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>That will be very right.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Then we will once more entreat Homer and the other poets not to depict 
<A NAME="98"></A>Achilles, who is the son of a goddess, first lying on his side, then on 
<A NAME="99"></A>his back, and then on his face; then starting up and sailing in a frenzy 
<A NAME="100"></A>along the shores of the barren sea; now taking the sooty ashes in both 
<A NAME="101"></A>his hands and pouring them over his head, or weeping and wailing in the 
<A NAME="102"></A>various modes which Homer has delineated. Nor should he describe Priam 
<A NAME="103"></A>the kinsman of the gods as praying and beseeching,
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>Rolling in the dirt, calling each man loudly by his name. Still 
<A NAME="105"></A>more earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce the gods 
<A NAME="106"></A>lamenting and saying,
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>Alas! my misery! Alas! that I bore the harvest to my sorrow. But 
<A NAME="108"></A>if he must introduce the gods, at any rate let him not dare so completely 
<A NAME="109"></A>to misrepresent the greatest of the gods, as to make him say 
<A NAME="110"></A>--
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>O heavens! with my eyes verily I behold a dear friend of mine chased 
<A NAME="112"></A>round and round the city, and my heart is sorrowful. Or again: 
<A NAME="113"></A>--
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>Woe is me that I am fated to have Sarpedon, dearest of men to me, 
<A NAME="115"></A>subdued at the hands of Patroclus the son of Menoetius. For if, my sweet 
<A NAME="116"></A>Adeimantus, our youth seriously listen to such unworthy representations 
<A NAME="117"></A>of the gods, instead of laughing at them as they ought, hardly will any 
<A NAME="118"></A>of them deem that he himself, being but a man, can be dishonoured by similar 
<A NAME="119"></A>actions; neither will he rebuke any inclination which may arise in his 
<A NAME="120"></A>mind to say and do the like. And instead of having any shame or self-control, 
<A NAME="121"></A>he will be always whining and lamenting on slight occasions.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that is most true.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Yes, I replied; but that surely is what ought not to be, as the argument 
<A NAME="124"></A>has just proved to us; and by that proof we must abide until it is disproved 
<A NAME="125"></A>by a better.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>It ought not to be.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Neither ought our guardians to be given to laughter. For a fit of laughter 
<A NAME="128"></A>which has been indulged to excess almost always produces a violent 
<A NAME="129"></A>reaction.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>So I believe.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Then persons of worth, even if only mortal men, must not be represented 
<A NAME="132"></A>as overcome by laughter, and still less must such a representation of the 
<A NAME="133"></A>gods be allowed.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>Still less of the gods, as you say, he replied.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Then we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods 
<A NAME="136"></A>as that of Homer when he describes how
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>Inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods, when they 
<A NAME="138"></A>saw Hephaestus bustling about the mansion. On your views, we must not admit 
<A NAME="139"></A>them.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>On my views, if you like to father them on me; that we must not 
<A NAME="141"></A>admit them is certain.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>Again, truth should be highly valued; if, as we were saying, a 
<A NAME="143"></A>lie is useless to the gods, and useful only as a medicine to men, then 
<A NAME="144"></A>the use of such medicines should be restricted to physicians; private individuals 
<A NAME="145"></A>have no business with them.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>Clearly not, he said.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Then if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying, the rulers 
<A NAME="148"></A>of the State should be the persons; and they, in their dealings either 
<A NAME="149"></A>with enemies or with their own citizens, may be allowed to lie for the 
<A NAME="150"></A>public good. But nobody else should meddle with anything of the kind; and 
<A NAME="151"></A>although the rulers have this privilege, for a private man to lie to them 
<A NAME="152"></A>in return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than for the patient or 
<A NAME="153"></A>the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about his own bodily illnesses 
<A NAME="154"></A>to the physician or to the trainer, or for a sailor not to tell the captain 
<A NAME="155"></A>what is happening about the ship and the rest of the crew, and how things 
<A NAME="156"></A>are going with himself or his fellow sailors.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Most true, he said.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>If, then, the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the 
<A NAME="159"></A>State,
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>Any of the craftsmen, whether he priest or physician or carpenter. 
<A NAME="161"></A>he will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally subversive 
<A NAME="162"></A>and destructive of ship or State.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>Most certainly, he said, if our idea of the State is ever carried 
<A NAME="164"></A>out.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>In the next place our youth must be temperate?
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>Are not the chief elements of temperance, speaking generally, obedience 
<A NAME="168"></A>to commanders and self-control in sensual pleasures?
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Then we shall approve such language as that of Diomede in 
<A NAME="171"></A>Homer,
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Friend, sit still and obey my word, and the verses which 
<A NAME="173"></A>follow,
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>The Greeks marched breathing prowess,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>...in silent awe of their leaders, and other sentiments of the same 
<A NAME="176"></A>kind.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>We shall.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>What of this line,
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>O heavy with wine, who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of 
<A NAME="180"></A>a stag, and of the words which follow? Would you say that these, or any 
<A NAME="181"></A>similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address 
<A NAME="182"></A>to their rulers, whether in verse or prose, are well or ill 
<A NAME="183"></A>spoken?
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>They are ill spoken.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>They may very possibly afford some amusement, but they do not conduce 
<A NAME="186"></A>to temperance. And therefore they are likely to do harm to our young men 
<A NAME="187"></A>--you would agree with me there?
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>And then, again, to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his 
<A NAME="190"></A>opinion is more glorious than
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>When the tables are full of bread and meat, and the cup-bearer 
<A NAME="192"></A>carries round wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups, 
<A NAME="193"></A>is it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such words? 
<A NAME="194"></A>Or the verse
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>The saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger? What 
<A NAME="196"></A>would you say again to the tale of Zeus, who, while other gods and men 
<A NAME="197"></A>were asleep and he the only person awake, lay devising plans, but forgot 
<A NAME="198"></A>them all in a moment through his lust, and was so completely overcome at 
<A NAME="199"></A>the sight of Here that he would not even go into the hut, but wanted to 
<A NAME="200"></A>lie with her on the ground, declaring that he had never been in such a 
<A NAME="201"></A>state of rapture before, even when they first met one 
<A NAME="202"></A>another
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>Without the knowledge of their parents; or that other tale of how 
<A NAME="204"></A>Hephaestus, because of similar goings on, cast a chain around Ares and 
<A NAME="205"></A>Aphrodite?
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, he said, I am strongly of opinion that they ought not to 
<A NAME="207"></A>hear that sort of thing.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>But any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men, 
<A NAME="209"></A>these they ought to see and hear; as, for example, what is said in the 
<A NAME="210"></A>verses,
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>He smote his breast, and thus reproached his 
<A NAME="212"></A>heart,
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Endure, my heart; far worse hast thou endured!
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>In the next place, we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers 
<A NAME="216"></A>of money.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Neither must we sing to them of
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>Gifts persuading gods, and persuading reverend kings. Neither is 
<A NAME="220"></A>Phoenix, the tutor of Achilles, to be approved or deemed to have given 
<A NAME="221"></A>his pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take the gifts of 
<A NAME="222"></A>the Greeks and assist them; but that without a gift he should not lay aside 
<A NAME="223"></A>his anger. Neither will we believe or acknowledge Achilles himself to have 
<A NAME="224"></A>been such a lover of money that he took Agamemnon's or that when he had 
<A NAME="225"></A>received payment he restored the dead body of Hector, but that without 
<A NAME="226"></A>payment he was unwilling to do so.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>Undoubtedly, he said, these are not sentiments which can be 
<A NAME="228"></A>approved.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>Loving Homer as I do, I hardly like to say that in attributing 
<A NAME="230"></A>these feelings to Achilles, or in believing that they are truly to him, 
<A NAME="231"></A>he is guilty of downright impiety. As little can I believe the narrative 
<A NAME="232"></A>of his insolence to Apollo, where he says,
<A NAME="233"></A><BR><BR>Thou hast wronged me, O far-darter, most abominable of deities. 
<A NAME="234"></A>Verily I would he even with thee, if I had only the power, or his insubordination 
<A NAME="235"></A>to the river-god, on whose divinity he is ready to lay hands; or his offering 
<A NAME="236"></A>to the dead Patroclus of his own hair, which had been previously dedicated 
<A NAME="237"></A>to the other river-god Spercheius, and that he actually performed this 
<A NAME="238"></A>vow; or that he dragged Hector round the tomb of Patroclus, and slaughtered 
<A NAME="239"></A>the captives at the pyre; of all this I cannot believe that he was guilty, 
<A NAME="240"></A>any more than I can allow our citizens to believe that he, the wise Cheiron's 
<A NAME="241"></A>pupil, the son of a goddess and of Peleus who was the gentlest of men and 
<A NAME="242"></A>third in descent from Zeus, was so disordered in his wits as to be at one 
<A NAME="243"></A>time the slave of two seemingly inconsistent passions, meanness, not untainted 
<A NAME="244"></A>by avarice, combined with overweening contempt of gods and 
<A NAME="245"></A>men.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>You are quite right, he replied.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>And let us equally refuse to believe, or allow to be repeated, the 
<A NAME="248"></A>tale of Theseus son of Poseidon, or of Peirithous son of Zeus, going forth 
<A NAME="249"></A>as they did to perpetrate a horrid rape; or of any other hero or son of 
<A NAME="250"></A>a god daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they falsely ascribe 
<A NAME="251"></A>to them in our day: and let us further compel the poets to declare either 
<A NAME="252"></A>that these acts were not done by them, or that they were not the sons of 
<A NAME="253"></A>gods; --both in the same breath they shall not be permitted to affirm. 
<A NAME="254"></A>We will not have them trying to persuade our youth that the gods are the 
<A NAME="255"></A>authors of evil, and that heroes are no better than men-sentiments which, 
<A NAME="256"></A>as we were saying, are neither pious nor true, for we have already proved 
<A NAME="257"></A>that evil cannot come from the gods.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>Assuredly not.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>And further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear 
<A NAME="260"></A>them; for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is convinced 
<A NAME="261"></A>that similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by 
<A NAME="262"></A>--
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>The kindred of the gods, the relatives of Zeus, whose ancestral 
<A NAME="264"></A>altar, the attar of Zeus, is aloft in air on the peak of Ida, and who 
<A NAME="265"></A>have
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins. And therefore 
<A NAME="267"></A>let us put an end to such tales, lest they engender laxity of morals among 
<A NAME="268"></A>the young.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>By all means, he replied.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>But now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are 
<A NAME="271"></A>not to be spoken of, let us see whether any have been omitted by us. The 
<A NAME="272"></A>manner in which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below should 
<A NAME="273"></A>be treated has been already laid down.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>And what shall we say about men? That is clearly the remaining portion 
<A NAME="276"></A>of our subject.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>Clearly so.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>But we are not in a condition to answer this question at present, my 
<A NAME="279"></A>friend.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>Why not?
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Because, if I am not mistaken, we shall have to say that about men 
<A NAME="282"></A>poets and story-tellers are guilty of making the gravest misstatements 
<A NAME="283"></A>when they tell us that wicked men are often happy, and the good miserable; 
<A NAME="284"></A>and that injustice is profitable when undetected, but that justice is a 
<A NAME="285"></A>man's own loss and another's gain --these things we shall forbid them to 
<A NAME="286"></A>utter, and command them to sing and say the opposite.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>To be sure we shall, he replied.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>But if you admit that I am right in this, then I shall maintain that 
<A NAME="289"></A>you have implied the principle for which we have been all along 
<A NAME="290"></A>contending.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>I grant the truth of your inference.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>That such things are or are not to be said about men is a question 
<A NAME="293"></A>which we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is, and 
<A NAME="294"></A>how naturally advantageous to the possessor, whether he seems to be just 
<A NAME="295"></A>or not.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>Most true, he said.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>Enough of the subjects of poetry: let us now speak of the style; and 
<A NAME="298"></A>when this has been considered, both matter and manner will have been completely 
<A NAME="299"></A>treated.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>I do not understand what you mean, said Adeimantus.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Then I must make you understand; and perhaps I may be more intelligible 
<A NAME="302"></A>if I put the matter in this way. You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology 
<A NAME="303"></A>and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to 
<A NAME="304"></A>come?
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he replied.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union 
<A NAME="307"></A>of the two?
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>That again, he said, I do not quite understand.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>I fear that I must be a ridiculous teacher when I have so much difficulty 
<A NAME="310"></A>in making myself apprehended. Like a bad speaker, therefore, I will not 
<A NAME="311"></A>take the whole of the subject, but will break a piece off in illustration 
<A NAME="312"></A>of my meaning. You know the first lines of the Iliad, in which the poet 
<A NAME="313"></A>says that Chryses prayed Agamemnon to release his daughter, and that Agamemnon 
<A NAME="314"></A>flew into a passion with him; whereupon Chryses, failing of his object, 
<A NAME="315"></A>invoked the anger of the God against the Achaeans. Now as far as these 
<A NAME="316"></A>lines,
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>And he prayed all the Greeks, but especially the two sons of Atreus, 
<A NAME="318"></A>the chiefs of the people, the poet is speaking in his own person; he never 
<A NAME="319"></A>leads us to suppose that he is any one else. But in what follows he takes 
<A NAME="320"></A>the person of Chryses, and then he does all that he can to make us believe 
<A NAME="321"></A>that the speaker is not Homer, but the aged priest himself. And in this 
<A NAME="322"></A>double form he has cast the entire narrative of the events which occurred 
<A NAME="323"></A>at Troy and in Ithaca and throughout the Odyssey.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>And a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites 
<A NAME="326"></A>from time to time and in the intermediate passages?
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>Quite true.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>But when the poet speaks in the person of another, may we not say that 
<A NAME="329"></A>he assimilates his style to that of the person who, as he informs you, 
<A NAME="330"></A>is going to speak?
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice 
<A NAME="333"></A>or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he 
<A NAME="334"></A>assumes?
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed 
<A NAME="337"></A>by way of imitation?
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>Or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then 
<A NAME="340"></A>again the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration. 
<A NAME="341"></A>However, in order that I may make my meaning quite clear, and that you 
<A NAME="342"></A>may no more say, I don't understand,' I will show how the change might 
<A NAME="343"></A>be effected. If Homer had said, 'The priest came, having his daughter's 
<A NAME="344"></A>ransom in his hands, supplicating the Achaeans, and above all the kings;' 
<A NAME="345"></A>and then if, instead of speaking in the person of Chryses, he had continued 
<A NAME="346"></A>in his own person, the words would have been, not imitation, but simple 
<A NAME="347"></A>narration. The passage would have run as follows (I am no poet, and therefore 
<A NAME="348"></A>I drop the metre), 'The priest came and prayed the gods on behalf of the 
<A NAME="349"></A>Greeks that they might capture Troy and return safely home, but begged 
<A NAME="350"></A>that they would give him back his daughter, and take the ransom which he 
<A NAME="351"></A>brought, and respect the God. Thus he spoke, and the other Greeks revered 
<A NAME="352"></A>the priest and assented. But Agamemnon was wroth, and bade him depart and 
<A NAME="353"></A>not come again, lest the staff and chaplets of the God should be of no 
<A NAME="354"></A>avail to him --the daughter of Chryses should not be released, he said 
<A NAME="355"></A>--she should grow old with him in Argos. And then he told him to go away 
<A NAME="356"></A>and not to provoke him, if he intended to get home unscathed. And the old 
<A NAME="357"></A>man went away in fear and silence, and, when he had left the camp, he called 
<A NAME="358"></A>upon Apollo by his many names, reminding him of everything which he had 
<A NAME="359"></A>done pleasing to him, whether in building his temples, or in offering sacrifice, 
<A NAME="360"></A>and praying that his good deeds might be returned to him, and that the 
<A NAME="361"></A>Achaeans might expiate his tears by the arrows of the god,' --and so on. 
<A NAME="362"></A>In this way the whole becomes simple narrative.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>I understand, he said.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Or you may suppose the opposite case --that the intermediate passages 
<A NAME="365"></A>are omitted, and the dialogue only left.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>That also, he said, I understand; you mean, for example, as in 
<A NAME="367"></A>tragedy.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>You have conceived my meaning perfectly; and if I mistake not, 
<A NAME="369"></A>what you failed to apprehend before is now made clear to you, that poetry 
<A NAME="370"></A>and mythology are, in some cases, wholly imitative --instances of this 
<A NAME="371"></A>are supplied by tragedy and comedy; there is likewise the opposite style, 
<A NAME="372"></A>in which the my poet is the only speaker --of this the dithyramb affords 
<A NAME="373"></A>the best example; and the combination of both is found in epic, and in 
<A NAME="374"></A>several other styles of poetry. Do I take you with me?
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; I see now what you meant.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>I will ask you to remember also what I began by saying, that we had 
<A NAME="377"></A>done with the subject and might proceed to the style.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I remember.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>In saying this, I intended to imply that we must come to an understanding 
<A NAME="380"></A>about the mimetic art, --whether the poets, in narrating their stories, 
<A NAME="381"></A>are to be allowed by us to imitate, and if so, whether in whole or in part, 
<A NAME="382"></A>and if the latter, in what parts; or should all imitation be 
<A NAME="383"></A>prohibited?
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>You mean, I suspect, to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be 
<A NAME="385"></A>admitted into our State?
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said; but there may be more than this in question: I really 
<A NAME="387"></A>do not know as yet, but whither the argument may blow, thither we 
<A NAME="388"></A>go.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>And go we will, he said.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Then, Adeimantus, let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be 
<A NAME="391"></A>imitators; or rather, has not this question been decided by the rule already 
<A NAME="392"></A>laid down that one man can only do one thing well, and not many; and that 
<A NAME="393"></A>if he attempt many, he will altogether fall of gaining much reputation 
<A NAME="394"></A>in any?
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>And this is equally true of imitation; no one man can imitate many 
<A NAME="397"></A>things as well as he would imitate a single one?
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>He cannot.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in 
<A NAME="400"></A>life, and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other parts 
<A NAME="401"></A>as well; for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied, the 
<A NAME="402"></A>same persons cannot succeed in both, as, for example, the writers of tragedy 
<A NAME="403"></A>and comedy --did you not just now call them imitations?
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I did; and you are right in thinking that the same persons 
<A NAME="405"></A>cannot succeed in both.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR>Any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at 
<A NAME="407"></A>once?
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>True.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Neither are comic and tragic actors the same; yet all these things 
<A NAME="410"></A>are but imitations.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>They are so.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>And human nature, Adeimantus, appears to have been coined into yet 
<A NAME="413"></A>smaller pieces, and to be as incapable of imitating many things well, as 
<A NAME="414"></A>of performing well the actions of which the imitations are 
<A NAME="415"></A>copies.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR><BR>Quite true, he replied.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>If then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our 
<A NAME="418"></A>guardians, setting aside every other business, are to dedicate themselves 
<A NAME="419"></A>wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the State, making this their craft, 
<A NAME="420"></A>and engaging in no work which does not bear on this end, they ought not 
<A NAME="421"></A>to practise or imitate anything else; if they imitate at all, they should 
<A NAME="422"></A>imitate from youth upward only those characters which are suitable to their 
<A NAME="423"></A>profession --the courageous, temperate, holy, free, and the like; but they 
<A NAME="424"></A>should not depict or be skilful at imitating any kind of illiberality or 
<A NAME="425"></A>baseness, lest from imitation they should come to be what they imitate. 
<A NAME="426"></A>Did you never observe how imitations, beginning in early youth and continuing 
<A NAME="427"></A>far into life, at length grow into habits and become a second nature, affecting 
<A NAME="428"></A>body, voice, and mind?
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>Yes, certainly, he said.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Then, I said, we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and 
<A NAME="431"></A>of whom we say that they ought to be good men, to imitate a woman, whether 
<A NAME="432"></A>young or old, quarrelling with her husband, or striving and vaunting against 
<A NAME="433"></A>the gods in conceit of her happiness, or when she is in affliction, or 
<A NAME="434"></A>sorrow, or weeping; and certainly not one who is in sickness, love, or 
<A NAME="435"></A>labour.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>Very right, he said.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Neither must they represent slaves, male or female, performing the 
<A NAME="438"></A>offices of slaves?
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>They must not.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>And surely not bad men, whether cowards or any others, who do the reverse 
<A NAME="441"></A>of what we have just been prescribing, who scold or mock or revile one 
<A NAME="442"></A>another in drink or out of in drink or, or who in any other manner sin 
<A NAME="443"></A>against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed, as the manner 
<A NAME="444"></A>of such is. Neither should they be trained to imitate the action or speech 
<A NAME="445"></A>of men or women who are mad or bad; for madness, like vice, is to be known 
<A NAME="446"></A>but not to be practised or imitated.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he replied.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, or 
<A NAME="449"></A>boatswains, or the like?
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>How can they, he said, when they are not allowed to apply their 
<A NAME="451"></A>minds to the callings of any of these?
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>Nor may they imitate the neighing of horses, the bellowing of bulls, 
<A NAME="453"></A>the murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean, thunder, and all that sort 
<A NAME="454"></A>of thing?
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>Nay, he said, if madness be forbidden, neither may they copy the 
<A NAME="456"></A>behaviour of madmen.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>You mean, I said, if I understand you aright, that there is one 
<A NAME="458"></A>sort of narrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when 
<A NAME="459"></A>he has anything to say, and that another sort will be used by a man of 
<A NAME="460"></A>an opposite character and education.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>And which are these two sorts? he asked.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Suppose, I answered, that a just and good man in the course of a narration 
<A NAME="463"></A>comes on some saying or action of another good man, --I should imagine 
<A NAME="464"></A>that he will like to personate him, and will not be ashamed of this sort 
<A NAME="465"></A>of imitation: he will be most ready to play the part of the good man when 
<A NAME="466"></A>he is acting firmly and wisely; in a less degree when he is overtaken by 
<A NAME="467"></A>illness or love or drink, or has met with any other disaster. But when 
<A NAME="468"></A>he comes to a character which is unworthy of him, he will not make a study 
<A NAME="469"></A>of that; he will disdain such a person, and will assume his likeness, if 
<A NAME="470"></A>at all, for a moment only when he is performing some good action; at other 
<A NAME="471"></A>times he will be ashamed to play a part which he has never practised, nor 
<A NAME="472"></A>will he like to fashion and frame himself after the baser models; he feels 
<A NAME="473"></A>the employment of such an art, unless in jest, to be beneath him, and his 
<A NAME="474"></A>mind revolts at it.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR>So I should expect, he replied.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>Then he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated 
<A NAME="477"></A>out of Homer, that is to say, his style will be both imitative and narrative; 
<A NAME="478"></A>but there will be very little of the former, and a great deal of the latter. 
<A NAME="479"></A>Do you agree?
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, he said; that is the model which such a speaker must 
<A NAME="481"></A>necessarily take.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>But there is another sort of character who will narrate anything, 
<A NAME="483"></A>and, the worse lie is, the more unscrupulous he will be; nothing will be 
<A NAME="484"></A>too bad for him: and he will be ready to imitate anything, not as a joke, 
<A NAME="485"></A>but in right good earnest, and before a large company. As I was just now 
<A NAME="486"></A>saying, he will attempt to represent the roll of thunder, the noise of 
<A NAME="487"></A>wind and hall, or the creaking of wheels, and pulleys, and the various 
<A NAME="488"></A>sounds of flutes; pipes, trumpets, and all sorts of instruments: he will 
<A NAME="489"></A>bark like a dog, bleat like a sheep, or crow like a cock; his entire art 
<A NAME="490"></A>will consist in imitation of voice and gesture, and there will be very 
<A NAME="491"></A>little narration.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>That, he said, will be his mode of speaking.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>These, then, are the two kinds of style?
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>And you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and 
<A NAME="496"></A>has but slight changes; and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen for 
<A NAME="497"></A>their simplicity, the result is that the speaker, if hc speaks correctly, 
<A NAME="498"></A>is always pretty much the same in style, and he will keep within the limits 
<A NAME="499"></A>of a single harmony (for the changes are not great), and in like manner 
<A NAME="500"></A>he will make use of nearly the same rhythm?
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>That is quite true, he said.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of 
<A NAME="503"></A>rhythms, if the music and the style are to correspond, because the style 
<A NAME="504"></A>has all sorts of changes.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>That is also perfectly true, he replied.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>And do not the two styles, or the mixture of the two, comprehend all 
<A NAME="507"></A>poetry, and every form of expression in words? No one can say anything 
<A NAME="508"></A>except in one or other of them or in both together.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>They include all, he said.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>And shall we receive into our State all the three styles, or one only 
<A NAME="511"></A>of the two unmixed styles? or would you include the 
<A NAME="512"></A>mixed?
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR>I should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of 
<A NAME="514"></A>virtue.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Yes, I said, Adeimantus, but the mixed style is also very charming: 
<A NAME="516"></A>and indeed the pantomimic, which is the opposite of the one chosen by you, 
<A NAME="517"></A>is the most popular style with children and their attendants, and with 
<A NAME="518"></A>the world in general.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>I do not deny it.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>But I suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our 
<A NAME="521"></A>State, in which human nature is not twofold or manifold, for one man plays 
<A NAME="522"></A>one part only?
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>Yes; quite unsuitable.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>And this is the reason why in our State, and in our State only, we 
<A NAME="525"></A>shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also, and a husbandman 
<A NAME="526"></A>to be a husbandman and not a dicast also, and a soldier a soldier and not 
<A NAME="527"></A>a trader also, and the same throughout?
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>And therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen, who are so 
<A NAME="530"></A>clever that they can imitate anything, comes to us, and makes a proposal 
<A NAME="531"></A>to exhibit himself and his poetry, we will fall down and worship him as 
<A NAME="532"></A>a sweet and holy and wonderful being; but we must also inform him that 
<A NAME="533"></A>in our State such as he are not permitted to exist; the law will not allow 
<A NAME="534"></A>them. And so when we have anointed him with myrrh, and set a garland of 
<A NAME="535"></A>wool upon his head, we shall send him away to another city. For we mean 
<A NAME="536"></A>to employ for our souls' health the rougher and severer poet or story-teller, 
<A NAME="537"></A>who will imitate the style of the virtuous only, and will follow those 
<A NAME="538"></A>models which we prescribed at first when we began the education of our 
<A NAME="539"></A>soldiers.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>We certainly will, he said, if we have the power.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Then now, my friend, I said, that part of music or literary education 
<A NAME="542"></A>which relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished; for 
<A NAME="543"></A>the matter and manner have both been discussed.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR>I think so too, he said.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Next in order will follow melody and song.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>That is obvious.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Every one can see already what we ought to say about them, if we are 
<A NAME="548"></A>to be consistent with ourselves.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>Socrates - GLAUCON
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>I fear, said Glaucon, laughing, that the words 'every one' hardly 
<A NAME="551"></A>includes me, for I cannot at the moment say what they should be; though 
<A NAME="552"></A>I may guess.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>At any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts --the 
<A NAME="554"></A>words, the melody, and the rhythm; that degree of knowledge I may 
<A NAME="555"></A>presuppose?
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; so much as that you may.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>And as for the words, there surely be no difference words between words 
<A NAME="558"></A>which are and which are not set to music; both will conform to the same 
<A NAME="559"></A>laws, and these have been already determined by us?
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>And the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words?
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>We were saying, when we spoke of the subject-matter, that we had no 
<A NAME="564"></A>need of lamentations and strains of sorrow?
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>And which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow? You are musical, 
<A NAME="567"></A>and can tell me.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>The harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor Lydian, and 
<A NAME="569"></A>the full-toned or bass Lydian, and such like.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR>These then, I said, must be banished; even to women who have a 
<A NAME="571"></A>character to maintain they are of no use, and much less to men. 
<A NAME="572"></A>Certainly.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>In the next place, drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly 
<A NAME="574"></A>unbecoming the character of our guardians.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR>Utterly unbecoming.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>And which are the soft or drinking harmonies?
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>The Ionian, he replied, and the Lydian; they are termed 
<A NAME="578"></A>'relaxed.'
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Well, and are these of any military use?
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Quite the reverse, he replied; and if so the Dorian and the Phrygian 
<A NAME="581"></A>are the only ones which you have left.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>I answered: Of the harmonies I know nothing, but I want to have 
<A NAME="583"></A>one warlike, to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the 
<A NAME="584"></A>hour of danger and stern resolve, or when his cause is failing, and he 
<A NAME="585"></A>is going to wounds or death or is overtaken by some other evil, and at 
<A NAME="586"></A>every such crisis meets the blows of fortune with firm step and a determination 
<A NAME="587"></A>to endure; and another to be used by him in times of peace and freedom 
<A NAME="588"></A>of action, when there is no pressure of necessity, and he is seeking to 
<A NAME="589"></A>persuade God by prayer, or man by instruction and admonition, or on the 
<A NAME="590"></A>other hand, when he is expressing his willingness to yield to persuasion 
<A NAME="591"></A>or entreaty or admonition, and which represents him when by prudent conduct 
<A NAME="592"></A>he has attained his end, not carried away by his success, but acting moderately 
<A NAME="593"></A>and wisely under the circumstances, and acquiescing in the event. These 
<A NAME="594"></A>two harmonies I ask you to leave; the strain of necessity and the strain 
<A NAME="595"></A>of freedom, the strain of the unfortunate and the strain of the fortunate, 
<A NAME="596"></A>the strain of courage, and the strain of temperance; these, I say, 
<A NAME="597"></A>leave.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>And these, he replied, are the Dorian and Phrygian harmonies of 
<A NAME="599"></A>which I was just now speaking.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR>Then, I said, if these and these only are to be used in our songs 
<A NAME="601"></A>and melodies, we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic 
<A NAME="602"></A>scale?
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>I suppose not.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Then we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners 
<A NAME="605"></A>and complex scales, or the makers of any other many-stringed curiously-harmonised 
<A NAME="606"></A>instruments?
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>But what do you say to flute-makers and flute-players? Would you admit 
<A NAME="609"></A>them into our State when you reflect that in this composite use of harmony 
<A NAME="610"></A>the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put together; even 
<A NAME="611"></A>the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute?
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>Clearly not.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>There remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city, and 
<A NAME="614"></A>the shepherds may have a pipe in the country.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>That is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the 
<A NAME="616"></A>argument.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>The preferring of Apollo and his instruments to Marsyas and his instruments 
<A NAME="618"></A>is not at all strange, I said.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>Not at all, he replied.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>And so, by the dog of Egypt, we have been unconsciously purging the 
<A NAME="621"></A>State, which not long ago we termed luxurious.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>And we have done wisely, he replied.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>Then let us now finish the purgation, I said. Next in order to harmonies, 
<A NAME="624"></A>rhythms will naturally follow, and they should be subject to the same rules, 
<A NAME="625"></A>for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre, or metres of every 
<A NAME="626"></A>kind, but rather to discover what rhythms are the expressions of a courageous 
<A NAME="627"></A>and harmonious life; and when we have found them, we shall adapt the foot 
<A NAME="628"></A>and the melody to words having a like spirit, not the words to the foot 
<A NAME="629"></A>and melody. To say what these rhythms are will be your duty --you must 
<A NAME="630"></A>teach me them, as you have already taught me the harmonies.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>But, indeed, he replied, I cannot tell you. I only know that there 
<A NAME="632"></A>are some three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are framed, 
<A NAME="633"></A>just as in sounds there are four notes out of which all the harmonies are 
<A NAME="634"></A>composed; that is an observation which I have made. But of what sort of 
<A NAME="635"></A>lives they are severally the imitations I am unable to 
<A NAME="636"></A>say.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR>Then, I said, we must take Damon into our counsels; and he will 
<A NAME="638"></A>tell us what rhythms are expressive of meanness, or insolence, or fury, 
<A NAME="639"></A>or other unworthiness, and what are to be reserved for the expression of 
<A NAME="640"></A>opposite feelings. And I think that I have an indistinct recollection of 
<A NAME="641"></A>his mentioning a complex Cretic rhythm; also a dactylic or heroic, and 
<A NAME="642"></A>he arranged them in some manner which I do not quite understand, making 
<A NAME="643"></A>the rhythms equal in the rise and fall of the foot, long and short alternating; 
<A NAME="644"></A>and, unless I am mistaken, he spoke of an iambic as well as of a trochaic 
<A NAME="645"></A>rhythm, and assigned to them short and long quantities. Also in some cases 
<A NAME="646"></A>he appeared to praise or censure the movement of the foot quite as much 
<A NAME="647"></A>as the rhythm; or perhaps a combination of the two; for I am not certain 
<A NAME="648"></A>what he meant. These matters, however, as I was saying, had better be referred 
<A NAME="649"></A>to Damon himself, for the analysis of the subject would be difficult, you 
<A NAME="650"></A>know.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR>Rather so, I should say.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>But there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of grace 
<A NAME="653"></A>is an effect of good or bad rhythm.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>None at all.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>And also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good and 
<A NAME="656"></A>bad style; and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style; for 
<A NAME="657"></A>our principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the words, and 
<A NAME="658"></A>not the words by them.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR>Just so, he said, they should follow the words.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>And will not the words and the character of the style depend on the 
<A NAME="661"></A>temper of the soul?
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>And everything else on the style?
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on 
<A NAME="666"></A>simplicity, --I mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered 
<A NAME="667"></A>mind and character, not that other simplicity which is only an euphemism 
<A NAME="668"></A>for folly?
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he replied.
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>And if our youth are to do their work in life, must they not make these 
<A NAME="671"></A>graces and harmonies their perpetual aim?
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>They must.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>And surely the art of the painter and every other creative and constructive 
<A NAME="674"></A>art are full of them, --weaving, embroidery, architecture, and every kind 
<A NAME="675"></A>of manufacture; also nature, animal and vegetable, --in all of them there 
<A NAME="676"></A>is grace or the absence of grace. And ugliness and discord and inharmonious 
<A NAME="677"></A>motion are nearly allied to ill words and ill nature, as grace and harmony 
<A NAME="678"></A>are the twin sisters of goodness and virtue and bear their 
<A NAME="679"></A>likeness.
<A NAME="680"></A><BR><BR>That is quite true, he said.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>But shall our superintendence go no further, and are the poets only 
<A NAME="682"></A>to be required by us to express the image of the good in their works, on 
<A NAME="683"></A>pain, if they do anything else, of expulsion from our State? Or is the 
<A NAME="684"></A>same control to be extended to other artists, and are they also to be prohibited 
<A NAME="685"></A>from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance and meanness 
<A NAME="686"></A>and indecency in sculpture and building and the other creative arts; and 
<A NAME="687"></A>is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be prevented from practising 
<A NAME="688"></A>his art in our State, lest the taste of our citizens be corrupted by him? 
<A NAME="689"></A>We would not have our guardians grow up amid images of moral deformity, 
<A NAME="690"></A>as in some noxious pasture, and there browse and feed upon many a baneful 
<A NAME="691"></A>herb and flower day by day, little by little, until they silently gather 
<A NAME="692"></A>a festering mass of corruption in their own soul. Let our artists rather 
<A NAME="693"></A>be those who are gifted to discern the true nature of the beautiful and 
<A NAME="694"></A>graceful; then will our youth dwell in a land of health, amid fair sights 
<A NAME="695"></A>and sounds, and receive the good in everything; and beauty, the effluence 
<A NAME="696"></A>of fair works, shall flow into the eye and ear, like a health-giving breeze 
<A NAME="697"></A>from a purer region, and insensibly draw the soul from earliest years into 
<A NAME="698"></A>likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>There can be no nobler training than that, he 
<A NAME="700"></A>replied.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>And therefore, I said, Glaucon, musical training is a more potent instrument 
<A NAME="702"></A>than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward 
<A NAME="703"></A>places of the soul, on which they mightily fasten, imparting grace, and 
<A NAME="704"></A>making the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful, or of him who 
<A NAME="705"></A>is ill-educated ungraceful; and also because he who has received this true 
<A NAME="706"></A>education of the inner being will most shrewdly perceive omissions or faults 
<A NAME="707"></A>in art and nature, and with a true taste, while he praises and rejoices 
<A NAME="708"></A>over and receives into his soul the good, and becomes noble and good, he 
<A NAME="709"></A>will justly blame and hate the bad, now in the days of his youth, even 
<A NAME="710"></A>before he is able to know the reason why; and when reason comes he will 
<A NAME="711"></A>recognise and salute the friend with whom his education has made him long 
<A NAME="712"></A>familiar.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, I quite agree with you in thinking that our youth 
<A NAME="714"></A>should be trained in music and on the grounds which you 
<A NAME="715"></A>mention.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR>Just as in learning to read, I said, we were satisfied when we 
<A NAME="717"></A>knew the letters of the alphabet, which are very few, in all their recurring 
<A NAME="718"></A>sizes and combinations; not slighting them as unimportant whether they 
<A NAME="719"></A>occupy a space large or small, but everywhere eager to make them out; and 
<A NAME="720"></A>not thinking ourselves perfect in the art of reading until we recognise 
<A NAME="721"></A>them wherever they are found:
<A NAME="722"></A><BR><BR>True --
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Or, as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water, or in a 
<A NAME="724"></A>mirror, only when we know the letters themselves; the same art and study 
<A NAME="725"></A>giving us the knowledge of both:
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><BR>Exactly --
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>Even so, as I maintain, neither we nor our guardians, whom we have 
<A NAME="728"></A>to educate, can ever become musical until we and they know the essential 
<A NAME="729"></A>forms, in all their combinations, and can recognise them and their images 
<A NAME="730"></A>wherever they are found, not slighting them either in small things or great, 
<A NAME="731"></A>but believing them all to be within the sphere of one art and 
<A NAME="732"></A>study.
<A NAME="733"></A><BR><BR>Most assuredly.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>And when a beautiful soul harmonises with a beautiful form, and the 
<A NAME="735"></A>two are cast in one mould, that will be the fairest of sights to him who 
<A NAME="736"></A>has an eye to see it?
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR>The fairest indeed.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>And the fairest is also the loveliest?
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>That may be assumed.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>And the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with 
<A NAME="741"></A>the loveliest; but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious 
<A NAME="742"></A>soul?
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR>That is true, he replied, if the deficiency be in his soul; but 
<A NAME="744"></A>if there be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of it, 
<A NAME="745"></A>and will love all the same.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR><BR>I perceive, I said, that you have or have had experiences of this 
<A NAME="747"></A>sort, and I agree. But let me ask you another question: Has excess of pleasure 
<A NAME="748"></A>any affinity to temperance?
<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR>How can that be? he replied; pleasure deprives a man of the use 
<A NAME="750"></A>of his faculties quite as much as pain.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR>Or any affinity to virtue in general?
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>None whatever.
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Any affinity to wantonness and intemperance?
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>Yes, the greatest.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>And is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual 
<A NAME="756"></A>love?
<A NAME="757"></A><BR><BR>No, nor a madder.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>Whereas true love is a love of beauty and order --temperate and 
<A NAME="759"></A>harmonious?
<A NAME="760"></A><BR><BR>Quite true, he said.
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true 
<A NAME="762"></A>love?
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>Then mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near 
<A NAME="765"></A>the lover and his beloved; neither of them can have any part in it if their 
<A NAME="766"></A>love is of the right sort?
<A NAME="767"></A><BR><BR>No, indeed, Socrates, it must never come near 
<A NAME="768"></A>them.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Then I suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make 
<A NAME="770"></A>a law to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity to his 
<A NAME="771"></A>love than a father would use to his son, and then only for a noble purpose, 
<A NAME="772"></A>and he must first have the other's consent; and this rule is to limit him 
<A NAME="773"></A>in all his intercourse, and he is never to be seen going further, or, if 
<A NAME="774"></A>he exceeds, he is to be deemed guilty of coarseness and bad 
<A NAME="775"></A>taste.
<A NAME="776"></A><BR><BR>I quite agree, he said.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Thus much of music, which makes a fair ending; for what should be the 
<A NAME="778"></A>end of music if not the love of beauty?
<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR>I agree, he said.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>After music comes gymnastic, in which our youth are next to be 
<A NAME="781"></A>trained.
<A NAME="782"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>Gymnastic as well as music should begin in early years; the training 
<A NAME="784"></A>in it should be careful and should continue through life. Now my belief 
<A NAME="785"></A>is, --and this is a matter upon which I should like to have your opinion 
<A NAME="786"></A>in confirmation of my own, but my own belief is, --not that the good body 
<A NAME="787"></A>by any bodily excellence improves the soul, but, on the contrary, that 
<A NAME="788"></A>the good soul, by her own excellence, improves the body as far as this 
<A NAME="789"></A>may be possible. What do you say?
<A NAME="790"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I agree.
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>Then, to the mind when adequately trained, we shall be right in handing 
<A NAME="792"></A>over the more particular care of the body; and in order to avoid prolixity 
<A NAME="793"></A>we will now only give the general outlines of the subject.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR><BR>Very good.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>That they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked 
<A NAME="796"></A>by us; for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and 
<A NAME="797"></A>not know where in the world he is.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; that a guardian should require another guardian to 
<A NAME="799"></A>take care of him is ridiculous indeed.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR>But next, what shall we say of their food; for the men are in training 
<A NAME="801"></A>for the great contest of all --are they not?
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said.
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>And will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to 
<A NAME="804"></A>them?
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>Why not?
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>I am afraid, I said, that a habit of body such as they have is but 
<A NAME="807"></A>a sleepy sort of thing, and rather perilous to health. Do you not observe 
<A NAME="808"></A>that these athletes sleep away their lives, and are liable to most dangerous 
<A NAME="809"></A>illnesses if they depart, in ever so slight a degree, from their customary 
<A NAME="810"></A>regimen?
<A NAME="811"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I do.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Then, I said, a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior 
<A NAME="813"></A>athletes, who are to be like wakeful dogs, and to see and hear with the 
<A NAME="814"></A>utmost keenness; amid the many changes of water and also of food, of summer 
<A NAME="815"></A>heat and winter cold, which they will have to endure when on a campaign, 
<A NAME="816"></A>they must not be liable to break down in health.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR>That is my view.
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>The really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music 
<A NAME="819"></A>which we were just now describing.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR>How so?
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>Why, I conceive that there is a gymnastic which, like our music, is 
<A NAME="822"></A>simple and good; and especially the military gymnastic.
<A NAME="823"></A><BR><BR>What do you mean?
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>My meaning may be learned from Homer; he, you know, feeds his heroes 
<A NAME="825"></A>at their feasts, when they are campaigning, on soldiers' fare; they have 
<A NAME="826"></A>no fish, although they are on the shores of the Hellespont, and they are 
<A NAME="827"></A>not allowed boiled meats but only roast, which is the food most convenient 
<A NAME="828"></A>for soldiers, requiring only that they should light a fire, and not involving 
<A NAME="829"></A>the trouble of carrying about pots and pans.
<A NAME="830"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>And I can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere 
<A NAME="832"></A>mentioned in Homer. In proscribing them, however, he is not singular; all 
<A NAME="833"></A>professional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in good condition 
<A NAME="834"></A>should take nothing of the kind.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; and knowing this, they are quite right in not taking 
<A NAME="836"></A>them.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR><BR>Then you would not approve of Syracusan dinners, and the refinements 
<A NAME="838"></A>of Sicilian cookery?
<A NAME="839"></A><BR><BR>I think not.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Nor, if a man is to be in condition, would you allow him to have a 
<A NAME="841"></A>Corinthian girl as his fair friend?
<A NAME="842"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>Neither would you approve of the delicacies, as they are thought, of 
<A NAME="844"></A>Athenian confectionery?
<A NAME="845"></A><BR><BR>Certainly not.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>All such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to melody 
<A NAME="847"></A>and song composed in the panharmonic style, and in all the rhythms. 
<A NAME="848"></A>Exactly.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR><BR>There complexity engendered license, and here disease; whereas 
<A NAME="850"></A>simplicity in music was the parent of temperance in the soul; and simplicity 
<A NAME="851"></A>in gymnastic of health in the body.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR>Most true, he said.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>But when intemperance and disease multiply in a State, halls of justice 
<A NAME="854"></A>and medicine are always being opened; and the arts of the doctor and the 
<A NAME="855"></A>lawyer give themselves airs, finding how keen is the interest which not 
<A NAME="856"></A>only the slaves but the freemen of a city take about 
<A NAME="857"></A>them.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR>Of course.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>And yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state 
<A NAME="860"></A>of education than this, that not only artisans and the meaner sort of people 
<A NAME="861"></A>need the skill of first-rate physicians and judges, but also those who 
<A NAME="862"></A>would profess to have had a liberal education? Is it not disgraceful, and 
<A NAME="863"></A>a great sign of want of good-breeding, that a man should have to go abroad 
<A NAME="864"></A>for his law and physic because he has none of his own at home, and must 
<A NAME="865"></A>therefore surrender himself into the hands of other men whom he makes lords 
<A NAME="866"></A>and judges over him?
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR>Of all things, he said, the most disgraceful.
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>Would you say 'most,' I replied, when you consider that there is a 
<A NAME="869"></A>further stage of the evil in which a man is not only a life-long litigant, 
<A NAME="870"></A>passing all his days in the courts, either as plaintiff or defendant, but 
<A NAME="871"></A>is actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his litigiousness; 
<A NAME="872"></A>he imagines that he is a master in dishonesty; able to take every crooked 
<A NAME="873"></A>turn, and wriggle into and out of every hole, bending like a withy and 
<A NAME="874"></A>getting out of the way of justice: and all for what? --in order to gain 
<A NAME="875"></A>small points not worth mentioning, he not knowing that so to order his 
<A NAME="876"></A>life as to be able to do without a napping judge is a far higher and nobler 
<A NAME="877"></A>sort of thing. Is not that still more disgraceful?
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that is still more disgraceful.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>Well, I said, and to require the help of medicine, not when a wound 
<A NAME="880"></A>has to be cured, or on occasion of an epidemic, but just because, by indolence 
<A NAME="881"></A>and a habit of life such as we have been describing, men fill themselves 
<A NAME="882"></A>with waters and winds, as if their bodies were a marsh, compelling the 
<A NAME="883"></A>ingenious sons of Asclepius to find more names for diseases, such as flatulence 
<A NAME="884"></A>and catarrh; is not this, too, a disgrace?
<A NAME="885"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, they do certainly give very strange and newfangled 
<A NAME="886"></A>names to diseases.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said, and I do not believe that there were any such diseases 
<A NAME="888"></A>in the days of Asclepius; and this I infer from the circumstance that the 
<A NAME="889"></A>hero Eurypylus, after he has been wounded in Homer, drinks a posset of 
<A NAME="890"></A>Pramnian wine well besprinkled with barley-meal and grated cheese, which 
<A NAME="891"></A>are certainly inflammatory, and yet the sons of Asclepius who were at the 
<A NAME="892"></A>Trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink, or rebuke Patroclus, 
<A NAME="893"></A>who is treating his case.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR><BR>Well, he said, that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given 
<A NAME="895"></A>to a person in his condition.
<A NAME="896"></A><BR><BR>Not so extraordinary, I replied, if you bear in mind that in former 
<A NAME="897"></A>days, as is commonly said, before the time of Herodicus, the guild of Asclepius 
<A NAME="898"></A>did not practise our present system of medicine, which may be said to educate 
<A NAME="899"></A>diseases. But Herodicus, being a trainer, and himself of a sickly constitution, 
<A NAME="900"></A>by a combination of training and doctoring found out a way of torturing 
<A NAME="901"></A>first and chiefly himself, and secondly the rest of the 
<A NAME="902"></A>world.
<A NAME="903"></A><BR><BR>How was that? he said.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>By the invention of lingering death; for he had a mortal disease which 
<A NAME="905"></A>he perpetually tended, and as recovery was out of the question, he passed 
<A NAME="906"></A>his entire life as a valetudinarian; he could do nothing but attend upon 
<A NAME="907"></A>himself, and he was in constant torment whenever he departed in anything 
<A NAME="908"></A>from his usual regimen, and so dying hard, by the help of science he struggled 
<A NAME="909"></A>on to old age.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR><BR>A rare reward of his skill!
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>Yes, I said; a reward which a man might fairly expect who never understood 
<A NAME="912"></A>that, if Asclepius did not instruct his descendants in valetudinarian arts, 
<A NAME="913"></A>the omission arose, not from ignorance or inexperience of such a branch 
<A NAME="914"></A>of medicine, but because he knew that in all well-ordered states every 
<A NAME="915"></A>individual has an occupation to which he must attend, and has therefore 
<A NAME="916"></A>no leisure to spend in continually being ill. This we remark in the case 
<A NAME="917"></A>of the artisan, but, ludicrously enough, do not apply the same rule to 
<A NAME="918"></A>people of the richer sort.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR><BR>How do you mean? he said.
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>I mean this: When a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough 
<A NAME="921"></A>and ready cure; an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife, --these 
<A NAME="922"></A>are his remedies. And if some one prescribes for him a course of dietetics, 
<A NAME="923"></A>and tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head, and all that sort 
<A NAME="924"></A>of thing, he replies at once that he has no time to be ill, and that he 
<A NAME="925"></A>sees no good in a life which is spent in nursing his disease to the neglect 
<A NAME="926"></A>of his customary employment; and therefore bidding good-bye to this sort 
<A NAME="927"></A>of physician, he resumes his ordinary habits, and either gets well and 
<A NAME="928"></A>lives and does his business, or, if his constitution falls, he dies and 
<A NAME="929"></A>has no more trouble.
<A NAME="930"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, and a man in his condition of life ought to use the 
<A NAME="931"></A>art of medicine thus far only.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR><BR>Has he not, I said, an occupation; and what profit would there 
<A NAME="933"></A>be in his life if he were deprived of his occupation?
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR>Quite true, he said.
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>But with the rich man this is otherwise; of him we do not say that 
<A NAME="936"></A>he has any specially appointed work which he must perform, if he would 
<A NAME="937"></A>live.
<A NAME="938"></A><BR><BR>He is generally supposed to have nothing to 
<A NAME="939"></A>do.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>Then you never heard of the saying of Phocylides, that as soon as a 
<A NAME="941"></A>man has a livelihood he should practise virtue?
<A NAME="942"></A><BR><BR>Nay, he said, I think that he had better begin somewhat 
<A NAME="943"></A>sooner.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>Let us not have a dispute with him about this, I said; but rather ask 
<A NAME="945"></A>ourselves: Is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man, or can 
<A NAME="946"></A>he live without it? And if obligatory on him, then let us raise a further 
<A NAME="947"></A>question, whether this dieting of disorders which is an impediment to the 
<A NAME="948"></A>application of the mind t in carpentering and the mechanical arts, does 
<A NAME="949"></A>not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of Phocylides?
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><BR>Of that, he replied, there can be no doubt; such excessive care 
<A NAME="951"></A>of the body, when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic, is most inimical 
<A NAME="952"></A>to the practice of virtue.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR><BR>Yes, indeed, I replied, and equally incompatible with the management 
<A NAME="954"></A>of a house, an army, or an office of state; and, what is most important 
<A NAME="955"></A>of all, irreconcilable with any kind of study or thought or self-reflection 
<A NAME="956"></A>--there is a constant suspicion that headache and giddiness are to be ascribed 
<A NAME="957"></A>to philosophy, and hence all practising or making trial of virtue in the 
<A NAME="958"></A>higher sense is absolutely stopped; for a man is always fancying that he 
<A NAME="959"></A>is being made ill, and is in constant anxiety about the state of his 
<A NAME="960"></A>body.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR><BR>Yes, likely enough.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>And therefore our politic Asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited 
<A NAME="963"></A>the power of his art only to persons who, being generally of healthy constitution 
<A NAME="964"></A>and habits of life, had a definite ailment; such as these he cured by purges 
<A NAME="965"></A>and operations, and bade them live as usual, herein consulting the interests 
<A NAME="966"></A>of the State; but bodies which disease had penetrated through and through 
<A NAME="967"></A>he would not have attempted to cure by gradual processes of evacuation 
<A NAME="968"></A>and infusion: he did not want to lengthen out good-for-nothing lives, or 
<A NAME="969"></A>to have weak fathers begetting weaker sons; --if a man was not able to 
<A NAME="970"></A>live in the ordinary way he had no business to cure him; for such a cure 
<A NAME="971"></A>would have been of no use either to himself, or to the 
<A NAME="972"></A>State.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR><BR>Then, he said, you regard Asclepius as a statesman.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>Clearly; and his character is further illustrated by his sons. Note 
<A NAME="975"></A>that they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines of 
<A NAME="976"></A>which I am speaking at the siege of Troy: You will remember how, when Pandarus 
<A NAME="977"></A>wounded Menelaus, they
<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR>Sucked the blood out of the wound, and sprinkled soothing remedies, 
<A NAME="979"></A>but they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or drink 
<A NAME="980"></A>in the case of Menelaus, any more than in the case of Eurypylus; the remedies, 
<A NAME="981"></A>as they conceived, were enough to heal any man who before he was wounded 
<A NAME="982"></A>was healthy and regular in habits; and even though he did happen to drink 
<A NAME="983"></A>a posset of Pramnian wine, he might get well all the same. But they would 
<A NAME="984"></A>have nothing to do with unhealthy and intemperate subjects, whose lives 
<A NAME="985"></A>were of no use either to themselves or others; the art of medicine was 
<A NAME="986"></A>not designed for their good, and though they were as rich as Midas, the 
<A NAME="987"></A>sons of Asclepius would have declined to attend them.
<A NAME="988"></A><BR><BR>They were very acute persons, those sons of 
<A NAME="989"></A>Asclepius.
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>Naturally so, I replied. Nevertheless, the tragedians and Pindar disobeying 
<A NAME="991"></A>our behests, although they acknowledge that Asclepius was the son of Apollo, 
<A NAME="992"></A>say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man who was at the point 
<A NAME="993"></A>of death, and for this reason he was struck by lightning. But we, in accordance 
<A NAME="994"></A>with the principle already affirmed by us, will not believe them when they 
<A NAME="995"></A>tell us both; --if he was the son of a god, we maintain that hd was not 
<A NAME="996"></A>avaricious; or, if he was avaricious he was not the son of a 
<A NAME="997"></A>god.
<A NAME="998"></A><BR><BR>All that, Socrates, is excellent; but I should like to put a question 
<A NAME="999"></A>to you: Ought there not to be good physicians in a State, and are not the 
<A NAME="1000"></A>best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions good and 
<A NAME="1001"></A>bad? and are not the best judges in like manner those who are acquainted 
<A NAME="1002"></A>with all sorts of moral natures?
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR><BR>Yes, I said, I too would have good judges and good physicians. 
<A NAME="1004"></A>But do you know whom I think good?
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR><BR>Will you tell me?
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>I will, if I can. Let me however note that in the same question you 
<A NAME="1007"></A>join two things which are not the same.
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR><BR>How so? he asked.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>Why, I said, you join physicians and judges. Now the most skilful physicians 
<A NAME="1010"></A>are those who, from their youth upwards, have combined with the knowledge 
<A NAME="1011"></A>of their art the greatest experience of disease; they had better not be 
<A NAME="1012"></A>robust in health, and should have had all manner of diseases in their own 
<A NAME="1013"></A>persons. For the body, as I conceive, is not the instrument with which 
<A NAME="1014"></A>they cure the body; in that case we could not allow them ever to be or 
<A NAME="1015"></A>to have been sickly; but they cure the body with the mind, and the mind 
<A NAME="1016"></A>which has become and is sick can cure nothing.
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR><BR>That is very true, he said.
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>But with the judge it is otherwise; since he governs mind by mind; 
<A NAME="1019"></A>he ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds, and to 
<A NAME="1020"></A>have associated with them from youth upwards, and to have gone through 
<A NAME="1021"></A>the whole calendar of crime, only in order that he may quickly infer the 
<A NAME="1022"></A>crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from his own self-consciousness; 
<A NAME="1023"></A>the honourable mind which is to form a healthy judgment should have had 
<A NAME="1024"></A>no experience or contamination of evil habits when young. And this is the 
<A NAME="1025"></A>reason why in youth good men often appear to be simple, and are easily 
<A NAME="1026"></A>practised upon by the dishonest, because they have no examples of what 
<A NAME="1027"></A>evil is in their own souls.
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, they are far too apt to be deceived.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>Therefore, I said, the judge should not be young; he should have learned 
<A NAME="1030"></A>to know evil, not from his own soul, but from late and long observation 
<A NAME="1031"></A>of the nature of evil in others: knowledge should be his guide, not personal 
<A NAME="1032"></A>experience.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, that is the ideal of a judge.
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>Yes, I replied, and he will be a good man (which is my answer to your 
<A NAME="1035"></A>question); for he is good who has a good soul. But the cunning and suspicious 
<A NAME="1036"></A>nature of which we spoke, --he who has committed many crimes, and fancies 
<A NAME="1037"></A>himself to be a master in wickedness, when he is amongst his fellows, is 
<A NAME="1038"></A>wonderful in the precautions which he takes, because he judges of them 
<A NAME="1039"></A>by himself: but when he gets into the company of men of virtue, who have 
<A NAME="1040"></A>the experience of age, he appears to be a fool again, owing to his unseasonable 
<A NAME="1041"></A>suspicions; he cannot recognise an honest man, because he has no pattern 
<A NAME="1042"></A>of honesty in himself; at the same time, as the bad are more numerous than 
<A NAME="1043"></A>the good, and he meets with them oftener, he thinks himself, and is by 
<A NAME="1044"></A>others thought to be, rather wise than foolish.
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR><BR>Most true, he said.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>Then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man, but 
<A NAME="1047"></A>the other; for vice cannot know virtue too, but a virtuous nature, educated 
<A NAME="1048"></A>by time, will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice: the virtuous, 
<A NAME="1049"></A>and not the vicious, man has wisdom --in my opinion.
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR><BR>And in mine also.
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>This is the sort of medicine, and this is the sort of law, which you 
<A NAME="1052"></A>sanction in your State. They will minister to better natures, giving health 
<A NAME="1053"></A>both of soul and of body; but those who are diseased in their bodies they 
<A NAME="1054"></A>will leave to die, and the corrupt and incurable souls they will put an 
<A NAME="1055"></A>end to themselves.
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR><BR>That is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the 
<A NAME="1057"></A>State.
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR><BR>And thus our youth, having been educated only in that simple music 
<A NAME="1059"></A>which, as we said, inspires temperance, will be reluctant to go to 
<A NAME="1060"></A>law.
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>And the musician, who, keeping to the same track, is content to practise 
<A NAME="1063"></A>the simple gymnastic, will have nothing to do with medicine unless in some 
<A NAME="1064"></A>extreme case.
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR><BR>That I quite believe.
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>The very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to stimulate 
<A NAME="1067"></A>the spirited element of his nature, and not to increase his strength; he 
<A NAME="1068"></A>will not, like common athletes, use exercise and regimen to develop his 
<A NAME="1069"></A>muscles.
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR><BR>Very right, he said.
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>Neither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed, as 
<A NAME="1072"></A>is often supposed, the one for the training of the soul, the other fir 
<A NAME="1073"></A>the training of the body.
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR><BR>What then is the real object of them?
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>I believe, I said, that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the 
<A NAME="1076"></A>improvement of the soul.
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR><BR>How can that be? he asked.
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>Did you never observe, I said, the effect on the mind itself of exclusive 
<A NAME="1079"></A>devotion to gymnastic, or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion 
<A NAME="1080"></A>to music?
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR><BR>In what way shown? he said.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>The one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity, the other of softness 
<A NAME="1083"></A>and effeminacy, I replied.
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said, I am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too 
<A NAME="1085"></A>much of a savage, and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond 
<A NAME="1086"></A>what is good for him.
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR><BR>Yet surely, I said, this ferocity only comes from spirit, which, 
<A NAME="1088"></A>if rightly educated, would give courage, but, if too much intensified, 
<A NAME="1089"></A>is liable to become hard and brutal.
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR><BR>That I quite think.
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>On the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness. 
<A NAME="1092"></A>And this also, when too much indulged, will turn to softness, but, if educated 
<A NAME="1093"></A>rightly, will be gentle and moderate.
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>And in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these 
<A NAME="1096"></A>qualities?
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>Assuredly.
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>And both should be in harmony?
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>Beyond question.
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>And the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>And the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish?
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>And, when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his 
<A NAME="1105"></A>soul through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy 
<A NAME="1106"></A>airs of which we were just now speaking, and his whole life is passed in 
<A NAME="1107"></A>warbling and the delights of song; in the first stage of the process the 
<A NAME="1108"></A>passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron, and made useful, 
<A NAME="1109"></A>instead of brittle and useless. But, if he carries on the softening and 
<A NAME="1110"></A>soothing process, in the next stage he begins to melt and waste, until 
<A NAME="1111"></A>he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of his soul; and he 
<A NAME="1112"></A>becomes a feeble warrior.
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR><BR>Very true.
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>If the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is speedily 
<A NAME="1115"></A>accomplished, but if he have a good deal, then the power of music weakening 
<A NAME="1116"></A>the spirit renders him excitable; --on the least provocation he flames 
<A NAME="1117"></A>up at once, and is speedily extinguished; instead of having spirit he grows 
<A NAME="1118"></A>irritable and passionate and is quite impracticable.
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR><BR>Exactly.
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>And so in gymnastics, if a man takes violent exercise and is a great 
<A NAME="1121"></A>feeder, and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy, at 
<A NAME="1122"></A>first the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit, and 
<A NAME="1123"></A>lie becomes twice the man that he was.
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>And what happens? if he do nothing else, and holds no con-a verse with 
<A NAME="1126"></A>the Muses, does not even that intelligence which there may be in him, having 
<A NAME="1127"></A>no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture, grow 
<A NAME="1128"></A>feeble and dull and blind, his mind never waking up or receiving nourishment, 
<A NAME="1129"></A>and his senses not being purged of their mists?
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR><BR>True, he said.
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>And he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy, uncivilized, never using 
<A NAME="1132"></A>the weapon of persuasion, --he is like a wild beast, all violence and fierceness, 
<A NAME="1133"></A>and knows no other way of dealing; and he lives in all ignorance and evil 
<A NAME="1134"></A>conditions, and has no sense of propriety and grace.
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR><BR>That is quite true, he said.
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>And as there are two principles of human nature, one the spirited and 
<A NAME="1137"></A>the other the philosophical, some God, as I should say, has given mankind 
<A NAME="1138"></A>two arts answering to them (and only indirectly to the soul and body), 
<A NAME="1139"></A>in order that these two principles (like the strings of an instrument) 
<A NAME="1140"></A>may be relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly 
<A NAME="1141"></A>harmonised.
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR><BR>That appears to be the intention.
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>And he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions, 
<A NAME="1144"></A>and best attempers them to the soul, may be rightly called the true musician 
<A NAME="1145"></A>and harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the 
<A NAME="1146"></A>strings.
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR><BR>You are quite right, Socrates.
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR>And such a presiding genius will be always required in our State if 
<A NAME="1149"></A>the government is to last.
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he will be absolutely necessary.
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR>Such, then, are our principles of nurture and education: Where would 
<A NAME="1152"></A>be the use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens, 
<A NAME="1153"></A>or about their hunting and coursing, their gymnastic and equestrian contests? 
<A NAME="1154"></A>For these all follow the general principle, and having found that, we shall 
<A NAME="1155"></A>have no difficulty in discovering them.
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR><BR>I dare say that there will be no difficulty.
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR>Very good, I said; then what is the next question? Must we not ask 
<A NAME="1158"></A>who are to be rulers and who subjects?
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR><BR>Certainly.
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR>There can be no doubt that the elder must rule the 
<A NAME="1161"></A>younger.
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>Clearly.
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR>And that the best of these must rule.
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR>That is also clear.
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR>Now, are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to 
<A NAME="1166"></A>husbandry?
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1168"></A><BR>And as we are to have the best of guardians for our city, must they 
<A NAME="1169"></A>not be those who have most the character of guardians?
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR>And to this end they ought to be wise and efficient, and to have a 
<A NAME="1172"></A>special care of the State?
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR><BR>True.
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR>And a man will be most likely to care about that which he 
<A NAME="1175"></A>loves?
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR>To be sure.
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR>And he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having 
<A NAME="1178"></A>the same interests with himself, and that of which the good or evil fortune 
<A NAME="1179"></A>is supposed by him at any time most to affect his own?
<A NAME="1180"></A><BR><BR>Very true, he replied.
<A NAME="1181"></A><BR>Then there must be a selection. Let us note among the guardians those 
<A NAME="1182"></A>who in their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is for the 
<A NAME="1183"></A>good of their country, and the greatest repugnance to do what is against 
<A NAME="1184"></A>her interests.
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR><BR>Those are the right men.
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>And they will have to be watched at every age, in order that we may 
<A NAME="1187"></A>see whether they preserve their resolution, and never, under the influence 
<A NAME="1188"></A>either of force or enchantment, forget or cast off their sense of duty 
<A NAME="1189"></A>to the State.
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR><BR>How cast off? he said.
<A NAME="1191"></A><BR>I will explain to you, I replied. A resolution may go out of a man's 
<A NAME="1192"></A>mind either with his will or against his will; with his will when he gets 
<A NAME="1193"></A>rid of a falsehood and learns better, against his will whenever he is deprived 
<A NAME="1194"></A>of a truth.
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR><BR>I understand, he said, the willing loss of a resolution; the meaning 
<A NAME="1196"></A>of the unwilling I have yet to learn.
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR><BR>Why, I said, do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of 
<A NAME="1198"></A>good, and willingly of evil? Is not to have lost the truth an evil, and 
<A NAME="1199"></A>to possess the truth a good? and you would agree that to conceive things 
<A NAME="1200"></A>as they are is to possess the truth?
<A NAME="1201"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he replied; I agree with you in thinking that mankind are 
<A NAME="1202"></A>deprived of truth against their will.
<A NAME="1203"></A><BR><BR>And is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft, 
<A NAME="1204"></A>or force, or enchantment?
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR><BR>Still, he replied, I do not understand you.
<A NAME="1206"></A><BR>I fear that I must have been talking darkly, like the tragedians. I 
<A NAME="1207"></A>only mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others forget; 
<A NAME="1208"></A>argument steals away the hearts of one class, and time of the other; and 
<A NAME="1209"></A>this I call theft. Now you understand me?
<A NAME="1210"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1211"></A><BR>Those again who are forced are those whom the violence of some pain 
<A NAME="1212"></A>or grief compels to change their opinion.
<A NAME="1213"></A><BR><BR>I understand, he said, and you are quite right.
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR>And you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change 
<A NAME="1215"></A>their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure, or the sterner 
<A NAME="1216"></A>influence of fear?
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR><BR>Yes, he said; everything that deceives may be said to 
<A NAME="1218"></A>enchant.
<A NAME="1219"></A><BR>Therefore, as I was just now saying, we must enquire who are the best 
<A NAME="1220"></A>guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest of 
<A NAME="1221"></A>the State is to be the rule of their lives. We must watch them from their 
<A NAME="1222"></A>youth upwards, and make them perform actions in which they are most likely 
<A NAME="1223"></A>to forget or to be deceived, and he who remembers and is not deceived is 
<A NAME="1224"></A>to be selected, and he who falls in the trial is to be rejected. That will 
<A NAME="1225"></A>be the way?
<A NAME="1226"></A><BR><BR>Yes.
<A NAME="1227"></A><BR>And there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for 
<A NAME="1228"></A>them, in which they will be made to give further proof of the same 
<A NAME="1229"></A>qualities.
<A NAME="1230"></A><BR><BR>Very right, he replied.
<A NAME="1231"></A><BR>And then, I said, we must try them with enchantments that is the third 
<A NAME="1232"></A>sort of test --and see what will be their behaviour: like those who take 
<A NAME="1233"></A>colts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature, so must 
<A NAME="1234"></A>we take our youth amid terrors of some kind, and again pass them into pleasures, 
<A NAME="1235"></A>and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved in the furnace, that 
<A NAME="1236"></A>we may discover whether they are armed against all enchantments, and of 
<A NAME="1237"></A>a noble bearing always, good guardians of themselves and of the music which 
<A NAME="1238"></A>they have learned, and retaining under all circumstances a rhythmical and 
<A NAME="1239"></A>harmonious nature, such as will be most serviceable to the individual and 
<A NAME="1240"></A>to the State. And he who at every age, as boy and youth and in mature life, 
<A NAME="1241"></A>has come out of the trial victorious and pure, shall be appointed a ruler 
<A NAME="1242"></A>and guardian of the State; he shall be honoured in life and death, and 
<A NAME="1243"></A>shall receive sepulture and other memorials of honour, the greatest that 
<A NAME="1244"></A>we have to give. But him who fails, we must reject. I am inclined to think 
<A NAME="1245"></A>that this is the sort of way in which our rulers and guardians should be 
<A NAME="1246"></A>chosen and appointed. I speak generally, and not with any pretension to 
<A NAME="1247"></A>exactness.
<A NAME="1248"></A><BR><BR>And, speaking generally, I agree with you, he 
<A NAME="1249"></A>said.
<A NAME="1250"></A><BR>And perhaps the word 'guardian' in the fullest sense ought to be applied 
<A NAME="1251"></A>to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign enemies and maintain 
<A NAME="1252"></A>peace among our citizens at home, that the one may not have the will, or 
<A NAME="1253"></A>the others the power, to harm us. The young men whom we before called guardians 
<A NAME="1254"></A>may be more properly designated auxiliaries and supporters of the principles 
<A NAME="1255"></A>of the rulers.
<A NAME="1256"></A><BR><BR>I agree with you, he said.
<A NAME="1257"></A><BR>How then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we 
<A NAME="1258"></A>lately spoke --just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers, if that 
<A NAME="1259"></A>be possible, and at any rate the rest of the city?
<A NAME="1260"></A><BR><BR>What sort of lie? he said.
<A NAME="1261"></A><BR>Nothing new, I replied; only an old Phoenician tale of what has often 
<A NAME="1262"></A>occurred before now in other places, (as the poets say, and have made the 
<A NAME="1263"></A>world believe,) though not in our time, and I do not know whether such 
<A NAME="1264"></A>an event could ever happen again, or could now even be made probable, if 
<A NAME="1265"></A>it did.
<A NAME="1266"></A><BR><BR>How your words seem to hesitate on your lips!
<A NAME="1267"></A><BR>You will not wonder, I replied, at my hesitation when you have 
<A NAME="1268"></A>heard.
<A NAME="1269"></A><BR><BR>Speak, he said, and fear not.
<A NAME="1270"></A><BR>Well then, I will speak, although I really know not how to look you 
<A NAME="1271"></A>in the face, or in what words to utter the audacious fiction, which I propose 
<A NAME="1272"></A>to communicate gradually, first to the rulers, then to the soldiers, and 
<A NAME="1273"></A>lastly to the people. They are to be told that their youth was a dream, 
<A NAME="1274"></A>and the education and training which they received from us, an appearance 
<A NAME="1275"></A>only; in reality during all that time they were being formed and fed in 
<A NAME="1276"></A>the womb of the earth, where they themselves and their arms and appurtenances 
<A NAME="1277"></A>were manufactured; when they were completed, the earth, their mother, sent 
<A NAME="1278"></A>them up; and so, their country being their mother and also their nurse, 
<A NAME="1279"></A>they are bound to advise for her good, and to defend her against attacks, 
<A NAME="1280"></A>and her citizens they are to regard as children of the earth and their 
<A NAME="1281"></A>own brothers.
<A NAME="1282"></A><BR><BR>You had good reason, he said, to be ashamed of the lie which you 
<A NAME="1283"></A>were going to tell.
<A NAME="1284"></A><BR><BR>True, I replied, but there is more coming; I have only told you 
<A NAME="1285"></A>half. Citizens, we shall say to them in our tale, you are brothers, yet 
<A NAME="1286"></A>God has framed you differently. Some of you have the power of command, 
<A NAME="1287"></A>and in the composition of these he has mingled gold, wherefore also they 
<A NAME="1288"></A>have the greatest honour;
