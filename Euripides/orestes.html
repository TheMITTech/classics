<A NAME="23"></A><B>ELECTRA</B>
<A NAME="24"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>There is naught so terrible to describe, be it physical pain 
<A NAME="25"></A>or heaven-sent affliction, that man's nature may not have to bear the burden 
<A NAME="26"></A>of it. Tantalus, they say, once so prosperous,-and I am not now taunting 
<A NAME="27"></A>him with his misfortunes,-Tantalus, the reputed son of Zeus, hangs suspended 
<A NAME="28"></A>in mid air, quailing at the crag which looms above his head; paying this 
<A NAME="29"></A>penalty, they say, for the shameful weakness he displayed in failing to 
<A NAME="30"></A>keep a bridle on his lips, when admitted by gods, though he was but mortal, 
<A NAME="31"></A>to share the honours of their feasts like one of them.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>He it was that begat Pelops, the father of Atreus, for whom the 
<A NAME="33"></A>goddess, when she had carded her wool, spun a web of strife, even to the 
<A NAME="34"></A>making of war with his own brother Thyestes. But why need I repeat that 
<A NAME="35"></A>hideous tale?
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>Well, Atreus slew Thyestes' children and feasted him on them; but,-passing 
<A NAME="37"></A>over intermediate events-from Atreus and Aerope of Crete sprang Agamemnon, 
<A NAME="38"></A>that famous chief,-if his was really fame,-and Menelaus. Now it was this 
<A NAME="39"></A>Menelaus who married Helen, Heaven's abhorrence; while his brother, King 
<A NAME="40"></A>Agamemnon, took Clytemnestra to wife, name of note in Hellas, and we three 
<A NAME="41"></A>daughters were his issue, Chrysothemis, Iphigenia, and myself Electra; 
<A NAME="42"></A>also a son Orestes; all of that one accursed mother, who slew her lord, 
<A NAME="43"></A>after snaring him in a robe that had no outlet. Her reason a maiden's lips 
<A NAME="44"></A>may not declare, and so leave that unexplained for the world to guess at. 
<A NAME="45"></A>What need for me to charge Phoebus with wrong-doing, though he instigated 
<A NAME="46"></A>Orestes to slay his own mother, a deed that few approved; still it was 
<A NAME="47"></A>his obedience to the god that made him slay her; I, too, feebly as a woman 
<A NAME="48"></A>would, shared in the deed of blood, as did Pylades who helped us to bring 
<A NAME="49"></A>it about.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>After this my poor Orestes fell sick of a cruel wasting disease; 
<A NAME="51"></A>upon his couch he lies prostrated, and it is his mother's blood that goads 
<A NAME="52"></A>him into frenzied fits; this I say, from dread of naming those goddesses, 
<A NAME="53"></A>whose terrors are chasing him before them,-even the Eumenides. 'Tis now 
<A NAME="54"></A>the sixth day since the body of his murdered mother was committed to the 
<A NAME="55"></A>cleansing fire; since then no food has passed his lips, nor hath he washed 
<A NAME="56"></A>his skin; but wrapped in his cloak he weeps in his lucid moments, whenever 
<A NAME="57"></A>the fever leaves him; other whiles he bounds headlong from his couch, as 
<A NAME="58"></A>colt when it is loosed from the yoke. Moreover, this city of Argos has 
<A NAME="59"></A>decreed that no man give us shelter at his fireside or speak to matricides 
<A NAME="60"></A>like us; yea, and this is the fateful day on which Argos will decide our 
<A NAME="61"></A>sentence, whether we are both to die by stoning, or to whet the steel and 
<A NAME="62"></A>plunge it in our necks. There is, 'tis true, one hope of escape still left 
<A NAME="63"></A>us; Menelaus has landed from Troy; his fleet now crowds the haven of Nauplia 
<A NAME="64"></A>where he is come to anchor, returned at last from Troy after ceaseless 
<A NAME="65"></A>wanderings; but Helen, that "lady of sorrows," as she styles herself, hath 
<A NAME="66"></A>he sent on to our palace, carefully waiting for the night, lest any of 
<A NAME="67"></A>those parents whose sons were slain beneath the walls of Troy, might see 
<A NAME="68"></A>her if she went by day, and set to stoning her. Within she sits, weeping 
<A NAME="69"></A>for her sister and the calamities of her family, and yet she hath still 
<A NAME="70"></A>some solace in her woe; for Hermione, the child she left at home in the 
<A NAME="71"></A>hour she sailed for Troys-the maid whom Menelaus brought from Sparta and 
<A NAME="72"></A>entrusted to my mother's keeping,-is still a cause of joy to her and a 
<A NAME="73"></A>reason to forget her sorrows.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>I, meantime, am watching each approach, against the moment I see 
<A NAME="75"></A>Menelaus arriving; for unless we find some safety there, we have but feeble 
<A NAME="76"></A>anchor to ride on otherwise.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>A helpless thing, an unlucky house! </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="79"></A><B>HELEN</B>
<A NAME="80"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Daughter of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon, hapless Electra, too 
<A NAME="81"></A>long now left a maid unwed! how is it with thee and thy brother, this ill-starred 
<A NAME="82"></A>Orestes who slew his mother! Speak; for referring the sin as I do to Phoebus, 
<A NAME="83"></A>I incur no pollution by letting thee accost me; and yet am truly sorry 
<A NAME="84"></A>for the fate of my sister Clytenmestra, on whom I ne'er set eyes after 
<A NAME="85"></A>I was driven by heaven-sent frenzy to sail on my disastrous voyage to Ilium; 
<A NAME="86"></A>but now that I am parted from her I bewail our misfortunes. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="87"></A><B>ELECTRA</B>
<A NAME="88"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Prithee, Helen, why should I speak of that which thine own 
<A NAME="89"></A>eyes can see the son of Agamemnon in his misery?
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>Beside his wretched corpse I sit, a sleepless sentinel; for corpse 
<A NAME="91"></A>he is, so faint his breath; not that I reproach him with his sufferings; 
<A NAME="92"></A>but thou art highly blest and thy husband too, and ye are come upon us 
<A NAME="93"></A>in the hour of adversity. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="101"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Unhappy enough to succumb to his misery.

<A NAME="103"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Prithee, maiden, wilt hear me a moment? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="104"></A><B>ELECTRA</B>
<A NAME="105"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Aye, with such small leisure as this watching o'er a brother

<A NAME="110"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Wouldst have me seek my mother's tomb? And why? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="111"></A><B>HELEN</B>
<A NAME="112"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>To carry an offering of hair and a libation from me. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="113"></A><B>ELECTRA</B>
<A NAME="114"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Art forbidden then to go to the tombs of those thou lovest? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="115"></A><B>HELEN</B>
<A NAME="116"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Nay, but I am ashamed to show myself in Argos. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="117"></A><B>ELECTRA</B>
<A NAME="118"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>A late repentance surely for one who left her home so shamefully 
<A NAME="119"></A>then. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="120"></A><B>HELEN</B>
<A NAME="121"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Thou hast told the truth, but thy telling is not kind to me. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="122"></A><B>ELECTRA</B>
<A NAME="123"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What is this supposed modesty before the eyes of Mycenae that 
<A NAME="124"></A>possesses thee? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="125"></A><B>HELEN</B>
<A NAME="126"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I am afraid of the fathers of those who lie dead beneath the 
<A NAME="127"></A>walls of Ilium. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="128"></A><B>ELECTRA</B>
<A NAME="129"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Good cause for fear; thy name is on every tongue in Argos. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="130"></A><B>HELEN</B>
<A NAME="131"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Then free me of my fear and grant me this boon. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="132"></A><B>ELECTRA</B>
<A NAME="133"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I could not bear to face my mother's grave. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="134"></A><B>HELEN</B>
<A NAME="135"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And yet 'twere shame indeed to send these offerings by a servant's 
<A NAME="136"></A>hand. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="137"></A><B>ELECTRA</B>
<A NAME="138"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Then why not send thy daughter Hermione?

<A NAME="151"></A>take these libations and these tresses of mine in thy hands, and go pour 
<A NAME="152"></A>round Clytemnestra's tomb a mingled cup of honey, milk, and frothing wine; 
<A NAME="153"></A>then stand upon the heaped-up grave, and proclaim therefrom, "Helen, thy 
<A NAME="154"></A>sister, sends thee these libations as her gift, fearing herself to approach 
<A NAME="155"></A>thy tomb from terror of the Argive mob"; and bid her harbour kindly thoughts 
<A NAME="156"></A>towards me and thee and my husband; towards these two wretched sufferers, 
<A NAME="157"></A>too, whom Heaven hath afflicted. Likewise promise that I will pay in full 
<A NAME="158"></A>whatever funeral gifts are due from me to a sister. Now go, my child, and 
<A NAME="159"></A>tarry not; and soon as thou hast made the offering at the tomb, bethink

<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>Did ye mark how she cut off her hair only at the ends, careful 
<A NAME="168"></A>to preserve its beauty? 'Tis the same woman as of old. May Heaven's hate

<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>Alack! here are my friends once more, coming to unite their plaintive

<A NAME="547"></A>a third having a drawn sword; but Pylades came to meet us, all undaunted, 
<A NAME="548"></A>like Hector of Troy or Ajax triple-plumed, as I saw him on the threshold 
<A NAME="549"></A>of Priam's palace; and we met point to point. But then it became most manifest 
<A NAME="550"></A>how inferior we Phrygians were to the warriors of Hellas in martial prowess. 
<A NAME="551"></A>There was one man flying, another slain, a third wounded, yet another craving 
<A NAME="552"></A>mercy to stave off death; but we escaped under cover of the darkness: while 
<A NAME="553"></A>some were falling, others staggering, and some laid low in death. And just 
<A NAME="554"></A>as her unhappy mother sunk to the ground to die, came luckless Hermione 
<A NAME="555"></A>to the palace; whereon those twain, like Bacchanals when they drop their 
<A NAME="556"></A>wands and seize a mountain-cub, rushed and seized her; then turned again 
<A NAME="557"></A>to the daughter of Zeus to slay her; but lo! she had vanished from the 
<A NAME="558"></A>room, passing right through the house by magic spells or wizards'arts or 
<A NAME="559"></A>heavenly fraud; O Zeus and earth, O day and night!
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>What happened afterwards I know not, for I stole out of the palace
