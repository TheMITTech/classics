<A NAME="21"></A><B>GHOST</B>
<A NAME="22"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Lo! I am come from out the charnel-house and gates of gloom, 
<A NAME="23"></A>where Hades dwells apart from gods, I Polydorus, a son of Hecuba the daughter 
<A NAME="24"></A>of Cisseus and of Priam. Now my father, when Phrygia's capital was threatened 
<A NAME="25"></A>with destruction by the spear of Hellas, took alarm and conveyed me secretly 
<A NAME="26"></A>from the land of Troy unto Polymestor's house, his friend in Thrace, who 
<A NAME="27"></A>sows these fruitful plains of Chersonese, curbing by his might a nation 
<A NAME="28"></A>delighting in horses. And with me my father sent great store of gold by 
<A NAME="29"></A>stealth, that, if ever Ilium's walls should fall, his children that survived 
<A NAME="30"></A>might not want for means to live. I was the youngest of Priam's sons; and 
<A NAME="31"></A>this it was that caused my stealthy removal from the land; for my childish 
<A NAME="32"></A>arm availed not to carry weapons or to wield the spear. So long then as 
<A NAME="33"></A>the bulwarks of our land stood firm, and Troy's battlements abode unshaken, 
<A NAME="34"></A>and my brother Hector prospered in his warring, I, poor child, grew up 
<A NAME="35"></A>and flourished, like some vigorous shoot, at the court of the Thracian, 
<A NAME="36"></A>my father's friend. But when Troy fell and Hector lost his life and my 
<A NAME="37"></A>father's hearth was rooted up, and himself fell butchered at the god-built 
<A NAME="38"></A>altar by the hands of Achilles' murderous son; then did my father's friend 
<A NAME="39"></A>slay me his helpless guest for the sake of the gold, and thereafter cast 
<A NAME="40"></A>me into the swell of the sea, to keep the gold for himself in his house. 
<A NAME="41"></A>And there I lie one time upon the strand, another in the salt sea's surge, 
<A NAME="42"></A>drifting ever up and down upon the billows, unwept, unburied; but now am 
<A NAME="43"></A>I hovering o'er the head of my dear mother Hecuba, a disembodied spirit, 
<A NAME="44"></A>keeping my airy station these three days, ever since my poor mother came 
<A NAME="45"></A>from Troy to linger here in Chersonese. Meantime all the Achaeans sit idly 
<A NAME="46"></A>here in their ships at the shores of Thrace; for the son of Peleus, even 
<A NAME="47"></A>Achilles, appeared above his tomb and stayed the whole host of Hellas, 
<A NAME="48"></A>as they were making straight for home across the sea, demanding to have 
<A NAME="49"></A>my sister Polyxena offered at his tomb, and to receive his guerdon. And 
<A NAME="50"></A>he will obtain this prize, nor will they that are his friends refuse the 
<A NAME="51"></A>gift; and on this very day is fate leading my sister to her doom. So will 
<A NAME="52"></A>my mother see two children dead at once, me and that ill-fated maid. For 
<A NAME="53"></A>I, to win a grave, ah me! will appear amid the rippling waves before her 
<A NAME="54"></A>bond-maid's feet. Yes! I have won this boon from the powers below, that 
<A NAME="55"></A>I should find tomb and fall into my mother's hands; so shall I get my heart's 
<A NAME="56"></A>desire; wherefore I will go and waylay aged Hecuba, for yonder she passeth 
<A NAME="57"></A>on her way from the shelter of Agamemnon's tent, terrified at my spectre. 
<A NAME="58"></A>Woe is thee! ah, mother mine! from a palace dragged to face a life of slavery! 
<A NAME="59"></A>how sad thy lot, as sad as once 'twas blest! Some god is now destroying 
<A NAME="60"></A>thee, setting this in the balance to outweigh thy former bliss.

<A NAME="65"></A>Guide these aged steps, my servants, forth before the house; support your 
<A NAME="66"></A>fellow-slave, your queen of yore, ye maids of Troy. Take hold upon my aged 
<A NAME="67"></A>hand, support me, guide me, lift me up; and I will lean upon your bended 
<A NAME="68"></A>arm as on a staff and quicken my halting footsteps onwards. O dazzling 
<A NAME="69"></A>light of Zeus! O gloom of night! why am I thus scared by fearful visions 
<A NAME="70"></A>of the night? O earth, dread queen, mother of dreams that flit on sable 
<A NAME="71"></A>wings! I am seeking to avert the vision of the night, the sight of horror 
<A NAME="72"></A>which I saw so clearly in my dreams touching my son, who is safe in Thrace, 
<A NAME="73"></A>and Polyxena my daughter dear. Ye gods of this land! preserve my son, the 
<A NAME="74"></A>last and only anchor of my house, now settled in Thrace, the land of snow, 
<A NAME="75"></A>safe in the keeping of his father's friend. Some fresh disaster is in store, 
<A NAME="76"></A>a new strain of sorrow will be added to our woe. Such ceaseless thrills 
<A NAME="77"></A>of terror never wrung my heart before. Oh! where, ye Trojan maidens, can 
<A NAME="78"></A>I find inspired Helenus or Cassandra, that they may read me my dream? For 
<A NAME="79"></A>I saw a dappled hind mangled by a wolf's bloody fangs, torn from my knees 
<A NAME="80"></A>by force in piteous wise. And this too filled me with affright; o'er the 
<A NAME="81"></A>summit of his tomb appeared Achilles' phantom, and for his guerdon he would 
<A NAME="82"></A>have one of the luckless maids of Troy. Wherefore, I implore you, powers 
<A NAME="83"></A>divine, avert this horror from my daughter, from my child.

<A NAME="84"></A><I>The CHORUS OF CAPTIVE TROJAN WOMEN enters.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="85"></A><B>CHORUS </B>
<A NAME="86"></A><I>singing</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="87"></A>Hecuba, I have hastened away to thee, leaving my master's tent, where the 
<A NAME="88"></A>lot assigned me as his appointed slave, in the day that was driven from 
<A NAME="89"></A>the city of Ilium, hunted by Achaeans thence at the point of the spear; 
<A NAME="90"></A>no alleviation bring I for thy sufferings; nay have laden myself with heavy 
<A NAME="91"></A>news, and am a herald of sorrow to thee, lady. 'Tis said the Achaeans have 
<A NAME="92"></A>determined in full assembly to offer thy daughter in sacrifice to Achilles; 
<A NAME="93"></A>for thou knowest how one day he appeared standing on his tomb in golden 
<A NAME="94"></A>harness, and stayed the sea-borne barques, though they had their sails 
<A NAME="95"></A>already hoisted, with this pealing cry, "Whither away so fast, ye Danai, 
<A NAME="96"></A>leaving my tomb without its prize?" Thereon arose a violent dispute with 
<A NAME="97"></A>stormy altercation, and opinion was divided in the warrior host of Hellas, 
<A NAME="98"></A>some being in favour of offering the sacrifice at the tomb, others dissenting. 
<A NAME="99"></A>There was Agamemnon, all eagerness in thy interest, because of his love 
<A NAME="100"></A>for the frenzied prophetess; but the two sons of Theseus, scions of Athens, 
<A NAME="101"></A>though supporting different proposals, yet agreed on the same decision, 
<A NAME="102"></A>which was to crown Achilles' tomb with fresh-spilt blood; for they said 
<A NAME="103"></A>they never would set Cassandra's love before Achilles' valour. Now the 
<A NAME="104"></A>zeal of the rival disputants was almost equal, until that shifty, smooth-mouthed 
<A NAME="105"></A>varlet, the son of Laertes, whose tongue is ever at the service of the 
<A NAME="106"></A>mob, persuaded the army not to put aside the best of all the Danai for 
<A NAME="107"></A>want of a bond-maid's sacrifice, nor have it said by any of the dead that 
<A NAME="108"></A>stand beside Persephone, "The Danai have left the plains of Troy without 
<A NAME="109"></A>one thought of gratitude for their brethren who died for Hellas." Odysseus 
<A NAME="110"></A>will be here in an instant, to drag the tender maiden from thy breast and 
<A NAME="111"></A>tear her from thy aged arms. To the temples, to the altars with thee! at 
<A NAME="112"></A>Agamemnon's knees throw thyself as a suppliant! Invoke alike the gods in 
<A NAME="113"></A>heaven and those beneath the earth. For either shall thy prayers avail 
<A NAME="114"></A>to spare thee the loss of thy unhappy child, or thou must live to see thy 
<A NAME="115"></A>daughter fall before the tomb, her crimson blood spurting in deep dark 
<A NAME="116"></A>jets from her neck with gold encircled. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="126"></A>messengers of woe! ye have made an end, an utter end of me; life on earth

<A NAME="216"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Art not thou then playing a sorry part to plot against me thus, 
<A NAME="217"></A>after the kind treatment thou didst by thy own confession receive from 
<A NAME="218"></A>me, showing me no gratitude but all the ill thou canst? A thankless race! 
<A NAME="219"></A>all ye who covet honour from the mob for your oratory. Oh that ye were 
<A NAME="220"></A>unknown to me ye who harm your friends and think no more of it, if ye can 
<A NAME="221"></A>but say a word to win the mob. But tell me, what kind of cleverness did 
<A NAME="222"></A>they think it, when against this child they passed their bloody vote? Was 
<A NAME="223"></A>it duty led them to slay a human victim at the tomb, where sacrifice of 
<A NAME="224"></A>oxen more befits? or does Achilles, if claiming the lives of those who 
<A NAME="225"></A>slew him as his recompense, show his justice by marking her out for death? 
<A NAME="226"></A>No! she at least ne'er injured him. He should have demanded Helen as a 
<A NAME="227"></A>victim at his tomb, for she it was that proved his ruin, bringing him to 
<A NAME="228"></A>Troy; or if some captive of surpassing beauty was to be singled out for 
<A NAME="229"></A>doom, this pointed not to us; for the daughter of Tyndareus was fairer 
<A NAME="230"></A>than all womankind, and her injury to him was proved no les than ours. 
<A NAME="231"></A>Against the justice of his plea I pit this argument. Now hear the recompense 
<A NAME="232"></A>due from thee to me at my request. On thy own confession, thou didst fall 
<A NAME="233"></A>at my feet and embrace my hand and aged cheek; I in my turn now do the 
<A NAME="234"></A>same to thee, and claim the favour then bestowed; and I implore thee, tear 
<A NAME="235"></A>not my child from my arms, nor slay her. There be dead enough; she is my 
<A NAME="236"></A>only joy, in her I forget my sorrows; My one comfort she in place of many 
<A NAME="237"></A>a loss, my city and my nurse, my staff and journey's guide. 'Tis never 
<A NAME="238"></A>right that those in power should use it out of season, or when prosperous 
<A NAME="239"></A>suppose they will be always so. For I like them was prosperous once, but

<A NAME="242"></A>them over, saying how hateful a thing it is to slay women whom at first 
<A NAME="243"></A>ye spared out of pity, after dragging them from the altars. For amongst 
<A NAME="244"></A>you the self-same law holds good for bond and free alike respecting bloodshed; 
<A NAME="245"></A>such influence as thine will persuade them even though thy words are weak; 
<A NAME="246"></A>for the same argument, when proceeding from those of no account, has not 
<A NAME="247"></A>the same force as when it is uttered by men of mark.

<A NAME="261"></A>him so no more? How now? what will they say, if once more there comes gathering 
<A NAME="262"></A>of the host and a contest with the foe? "Shall we fight or nurse our lives, 
<A NAME="263"></A>seeing the dead have no honours?" For myself, indeed, though in life my 
<A NAME="264"></A>daily store were scant, yet would it be all-sufficient, but as touching 
<A NAME="265"></A>a tomb I should wish mine to be an object of respect, for this gratitude 
<A NAME="266"></A>has long to run. Thou speakest of cruel sufferings; hear my answer. Amongst 
<A NAME="267"></A>us are aged dames and grey old men no less miserable than thou, and brides

<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>All Achaea's host was gathered there in full array before the tomb 
<A NAME="468"></A>to see thy daughter offered; and the son of Achilles took Polyxena by the 
<A NAME="469"></A>hand and set her on the top of the mound, while I stood near; and a chosen 
<A NAME="470"></A>band of young Achaeans followed to hold thy child and prevent her struggling. 
<A NAME="471"></A>Then did Achilles' son take in his hands a brimming cup of gold and poured 
<A NAME="472"></A>an offering to his dead sire, making a sign to me to proclaim silence throughout 
<A NAME="473"></A>the Achaean host. So I stood at his side and in their midst proclaimed, 
<A NAME="474"></A>"Silence, ye Achaeans! hushed be the people all! peace! be still! "Therewith 
<A NAME="475"></A>I hushed the host. Then spake he, "Son of Peleus, father mine, accept the 
<A NAME="476"></A>offering I pour thee to appease thy spirit, strong to raise the dead; and 
<A NAME="477"></A>come to drink the black blood of a virgin pure, which I and the host are 
<A NAME="478"></A>offering thee; oh! be propitious to us; grant that we may loose our prows 
<A NAME="479"></A>and the cables of our ships, and, meeting with prosperous voyage from Ilium, 
<A NAME="480"></A>all to our country come." So he; and all the army echoed his prayer. Then 
<A NAME="481"></A>seizing his golden sword by the hilt he drew it from its scabbard, signing 
<A NAME="482"></A>the while to the picked young Argive warriors to hold the maid. But she, 
<A NAME="483"></A>when she was ware thereof, uttered her voice and said: "O Argives, who 
<A NAME="484"></A>have sacked my city! of my free will I die; let none lay hand on me; for 
<A NAME="485"></A>bravely will I yield my neck. Leave me free, I do beseech; so slay me, 
<A NAME="486"></A>that death may find me free; for to be called a slave amongst the dead 
<A NAME="487"></A>fills my royal heart with shame." Thereat the people shouted their applause, 
<A NAME="488"></A>and king Agamemnon bade the young men loose the maid. So they set her free, 
<A NAME="489"></A>as soon as they heard this last command from him whose might was over all. 
<A NAME="490"></A>And she, hearing her captors' words took her robe and tore it open from 
<A NAME="491"></A>the shoulder to the waist, displaying a breast and bosom fair as a statue's; 
<A NAME="492"></A>then sinking on her knee, one word she spake more piteous than all the 
<A NAME="493"></A>rest, "Young prince, if 'tis my breast thou'dst strike, lo! here it is, 
<A NAME="494"></A>strike home! or if at my neck thy sword thou'lt aim, behold! that neck 
<A NAME="495"></A>is bared."
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>Then he, half glad, half sorry in his pity for the maid, cleft 
<A NAME="497"></A>with the steel the channels of her breath, and streams of blood gushed 
<A NAME="498"></A>forth; but she, e'en in death's agony, took good heed to fall with maiden 
<A NAME="499"></A>grace, hiding from gaze of man what modest maiden must. Soon as she had 
<A NAME="500"></A>breathed her last through the fatal gash, each Argive set his hand to different 
<A NAME="501"></A>tasks, some strewing leaves o'er the corpse in handfuls, others bringing 
<A NAME="502"></A>pine-logs and heaping up a pyre; and he, who brought nothing, would hear

<A NAME="1102"></A><B>POLYMESTOR</B>
<A NAME="1103"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I will tell my tale. There was a son of Priam, Polydorus, the 
<A NAME="1104"></A>youngest, a child by Hecuba, whom his father Priam sent to me from Troy 
<A NAME="1105"></A>to bring up in my halls, suspecting no doubt the fall of Troy. Him I slew; 
<A NAME="1106"></A>but hear my reason for so doing, to show how cleverly and wisely I had 
<A NAME="1107"></A>planned. My fear was that if that child were left to be thy enemy, he would 
<A NAME="1108"></A>re-people Troy and settle it afresh; and the Achaeans, knowing that a son 
<A NAME="1109"></A>of Priam survived, might bring another expedition against the Phrygian 
<A NAME="1110"></A>land and harry and lay waste these plains of Thrace hereafter, for the 
<A NAME="1111"></A>neighbours of Troy to experience the very troubles we were lately suffering, 
<A NAME="1112"></A>O king. Now Hecuba, having discovered the death of her son, brought me 
<A NAME="1113"></A>hither on this pretext, saying she would tell me of hidden treasure stored 
<A NAME="1114"></A>up in Ilium by the race of Priam; and she led me apart with my children 
<A NAME="1115"></A>into the tent, that none but I might hear her news. So I sat me down on 
<A NAME="1116"></A>a couch in their midst to rest; for there were many of the Trojan maidens 
<A NAME="1117"></A>seated there, some on my right hand, some on my left, as it had been beside 
<A NAME="1118"></A>a friend; and they were praising the weaving of our Thracian handiwork, 
<A NAME="1119"></A>looking at this robe as they held it up to the light; meantime others examined 
<A NAME="1120"></A>my Thracian spear and so stripped me of the protection of both. And those 
<A NAME="1121"></A>that were young mothers were dandling my children in their arms, with loud 
<A NAME="1122"></A>admiration, as they passed them on from hand to hand to remove them far 
<A NAME="1123"></A>from their father; and then after their smooth speeches 
<A NAME="1124"></A> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="1125"></A><I>wouldst thou believe it?</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="1126"></A>in an instant snatching daggers from some secret place in their dress they 
<A NAME="1127"></A>stab my children; whilst others, like foes, seized me hand and foot; and 
<A NAME="1128"></A>if I tried to raise my head, anxious to help my babes, they would clutch 
<A NAME="1129"></A>me by the hair; while if I stirred my hands, I could do nothing, poor wretch! 
<A NAME="1130"></A>for the numbers of the women. At last they wrought a fearful deed, worse 
<A NAME="1131"></A>than what had gone before; for they took their brooches and stabbed the 
<A NAME="1132"></A>pupils of my hapless eyes, making them gush with blood, and then fled through 
<A NAME="1133"></A>the chambers; up I sprang like a wild beast in pursuit of the shameless 
<A NAME="1134"></A>murderesses, searching along each wall with hunter's care, dealing buffets, 
<A NAME="1135"></A>spreading ruin. This then is what I have suffered because of my zeal for 
<A NAME="1136"></A>thee, O Agamemnon, for slaying an enemy of thine. But to spare thee a lengthy 
<A NAME="1137"></A>speech; if any of the men of former times have spoken ill of women, if 
<A NAME="1138"></A>any doth so now, or shall do so hereafter, all this in one short sentence 
<A NAME="1139"></A>will say; for neither land or sea produces a race so pestilent, as whosoever 
<A NAME="1140"></A>hath had to do with them knows full well. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="1143"></A>thus embrace the whole race of women in one reproach; for though some of

<A NAME="1145"></A>amongst us who rank naturally amongst the good. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="1146"></A><B>HECUBA</B>
<A NAME="1147"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Never ought words to have outweighed deeds in this world, Agamemnon. 
<A NAME="1148"></A>No! if a man's deeds had been good, so should his words have been; if, 
<A NAME="1149"></A>on the other hand, evil, his words should have betrayed their unsoundness, 
<A NAME="1150"></A>instead of its being possible at times to give a fair complexion to injustice. 
<A NAME="1151"></A>There are, 'tis true, clever persons, who have made a science of this, 
<A NAME="1152"></A>but their cleverness cannot last for ever; a miserable end awaits them; 
<A NAME="1153"></A>none ever yet escaped. This is a warning I give thee at the outset. Now 
<A NAME="1154"></A>will I turn to this fellow, and will give thee thy answer, thou who sayest 
<A NAME="1155"></A>it was to save Achaea double toil and for Agamemnon's sake that thou didst 
<A NAME="1156"></A>slay my son. Nay, villain, in the first place how could the barbarian race 
<A NAME="1157"></A>ever be friends with Hellas? Impossible, ever. Again, what interest hadst 
<A NAME="1158"></A>thou to further by thy zeal? was it to form some marriage, or on the score 
<A NAME="1159"></A>of kin, or, prithee, why? or was it likely that they would sail hither 
<A NAME="1160"></A>again and destroy thy country's crops? Whom dost thou expect to persuade 
<A NAME="1161"></A>into believing that? Wouldst thou but speak the truth, it was the gold 
<A NAME="1162"></A>that slew my son, and thy greedy spirit. Now tell me this; why, when Troy 
<A NAME="1163"></A>was victorious, when her ramparts still stood round her, when Priam was 
<A NAME="1164"></A>alive, and Hector's warring prospered, why didst thou not, if thou wert 
<A NAME="1165"></A>really minded to do Agamemnon a service, then slay the child, for thou 
<A NAME="1166"></A>hadst him in thy palace 'neath thy care, or bring him with thee alive to 
<A NAME="1167"></A>the Argives? Instead of this, when our sun was set and the smoke of our 
<A NAME="1168"></A>city showed it was in the enemy's power, thou didst murder the guest who 
<A NAME="1169"></A>had come to thy hearth. Furthermore, to prove thy villainly, hear this; 
<A NAME="1170"></A>if thou wert really a friend to those Achaeans, thou shouldst have brought 
<A NAME="1171"></A>the gold, which thou sayst thou art keeping not for thyself but for Agamemnon, 
<A NAME="1172"></A>and given it to them, for they were in need and had endured a long exile 
<A NAME="1173"></A>from their native land. Whereas not even now canst thou bring thyself to 
<A NAME="1174"></A>part with it, but persistest in keeping it in thy palace. Again, hadst 
<A NAME="1175"></A>thou kept my son safe and sound, as thy duty was, a fair renown would have 
<A NAME="1176"></A>been thy reward, for it is in trouble's hour that the good most clearly 
<A NAME="1177"></A>show their friendship; though prosperity of itself in every case finds 
<A NAME="1178"></A>friends. Wert thou in need of money and he prosperous, that son of mine 
<A NAME="1179"></A>would have been as a mighty treasure for thee to draw upon; but now thou 
<A NAME="1180"></A>hast him no longer to be thy friend, and the benefit of the gold is gone 
<A NAME="1181"></A>from thee, thy children too are dead, and thyself art in this sorry 
<A NAME="1182"></A>plight.
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR><BR>To thee, Agamemnon, I say, if thou help this man, thou wilt show 
<A NAME="1184"></A>thy worthlessness; for thou wilt be serving one devoid of honour or piety, 
<A NAME="1185"></A>a stranger to the claims of good faith, a wicked host; while I shall say 
<A NAME="1186"></A>thou delightest in evil-doers, being such an one thyself; but I rail not 
<A NAME="1187"></A>at my masters. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="1193"></A>but still I must; yea, for to take this matter in hand and then put it 
<A NAME="1194"></A>from me is a shameful course. My opinion, that thou mayst know it, is that 
<A NAME="1195"></A>it was not for the sake of the Achaeans or me that thou didst slay thy 
<A NAME="1196"></A>guest, but to keep that gold in thy own house. In thy trouble thou makest 
<A NAME="1197"></A>a case in thy own interests. Maybe amongst you 'tis a light thing to murder 
<A NAME="1198"></A>guests, but with us in Hellas 'tis a disgrace. How can I escape reproach 
<A NAME="1199"></A>if I judge the not guilty? I cannot do it. Nay, since thou didst dare thy 
<A NAME="1200"></A>horrid crime, endure as well its painful consequence.
