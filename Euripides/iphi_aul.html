<A NAME="26"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I am all eagerness. 'Tis little enough sleep old age allows

<A NAME="34"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>The birds are still at any rate and the sea is calm; hushed

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="36"></A><B>ATTENDANT</B>
<A NAME="37"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Then why art thou outside thy tent, why so restless, my lord 
<A NAME="38"></A>Agamemnon? All is yet quiet here in Aulis, the watch on the walls is not 
<A NAME="39"></A>yet astir. Let us go in. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="40"></A><B>AGAMEMNON</B>
<A NAME="41"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I envy thee, old man, aye, and every man who leads a life secure, 
<A NAME="42"></A>unknown and unrenowned; but little I envy those in office. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="43"></A><B>ATTENDANT</B>
<A NAME="44"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And yet 'tis there we place the be-all and end-all of existence. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="45"></A><B>AGAMEMNON</B>
<A NAME="46"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Aye, but that is where the danger comes; and ambition, sweet 
<A NAME="47"></A>though it seems, brings sorrow with its near approach. At one time the 
<A NAME="48"></A>unsatisfied claims of Heaven upset our life, at another the numerous peevish 
<A NAME="49"></A>fancies of our subjects shatter it. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="50"></A><B>ATTENDANT</B>
<A NAME="51"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I like not these sentiments in one who is a chief. It was not 
<A NAME="52"></A>to enjoy all blessings that Atreus begot thee, O Agamemnon; but thou must 
<A NAME="53"></A>needs experience joy and sorrow alike, mortal as thou art. E'en though 
<A NAME="54"></A>thou like it not, this is what the gods decree; but thou, after letting 
<A NAME="55"></A>thy taper spread its light abroad, writest the letter which is still in 
<A NAME="56"></A>thy hands and then erasest the same words again, sealing and re-opening 
<A NAME="57"></A>the scroll, then flinging the tablet to the ground with floods of tears 
<A NAME="58"></A>and leaving nothing undone in thy aimless behaviour to stamp thee mad. 
<A NAME="59"></A>What is it troubles thee? what news is there affecting thee, my liege? 
<A NAME="60"></A>Come, share with me thy story; to a loyal and trusty heart wilt thou be 
<A NAME="61"></A>telling it; for Tyndareus sent me that day to form part of thy wife's dowry 
<A NAME="62"></A>and to wait upon the bride with loyalty. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="63"></A><B>AGAMEMNON</B>
<A NAME="64"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Leda, the daughter of Thestius, had three children, maidens, 
<A NAME="65"></A>Phoebe, Clytaemnestra my wife, and Helen; this last it was who had for 
<A NAME="66"></A>wooers the foremost of the favoured sons of Hellas; but terrible threats 
<A NAME="67"></A>of spilling his rival's blood were uttered by each of them, should he fail 
<A NAME="68"></A>to win the maid. Now the matter filled Tyndareus, her father, with perplexity; 
<A NAME="69"></A>at length this thought occurred to him; the suitors should swear unto each 
<A NAME="70"></A>other and join right hands thereon and pour libations with burnt sacrifice, 
<A NAME="71"></A>binding themselves by this curse, "Whoever wins the child of Tyndareus 
<A NAME="72"></A>for wife, him will we assist, in case a rival takes her from his house 
<A NAME="73"></A>and goes his way, robbing her husband of his rights; and we will march 
<A NAME="74"></A>against that man in armed array and raze his city to the ground, Hellene 
<A NAME="75"></A>no less than barbarian."
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>Now when they had once pledged their word and old Tyndareus with 
<A NAME="77"></A>no small cleverness had beguiled them by his shrewd device, he allowed 
<A NAME="78"></A>his daughter to choose from among her suitors the one towards whom the 
<A NAME="79"></A>breath of love might fondly waft her. Her choice fell on Menelaus; would 
<A NAME="80"></A>she had never taken him! Anon there came to Lacedaemon from Phrygia's folk 
<A NAME="81"></A>the man who, legend says, adjudged the goddesses' dispute; in robes of 
<A NAME="82"></A>gorgeous hue, ablaze with gold, in true barbaric pomp; and he, finding 
<A NAME="83"></A>Menelaus gone from home, carried Helen off with him to his steading on 
<A NAME="84"></A>Ida, a willing paramour. Goaded to frenzy Menelaus flew through Hellas, 
<A NAME="85"></A>invoking the ancient oath exacted by Tyndareus and declaring the duty of 
<A NAME="86"></A>helping the injured husband. Whereat the chivalry of Hellas, brandishing 
<A NAME="87"></A>their spears and donning their harness, came hither to the narrow straits 
<A NAME="88"></A>of Aulis with armaments of ships and troops, with many a steed and many 
<A NAME="89"></A>a car, and they chose me to captain them all for the sake of Menelaus, 
<A NAME="90"></A>since I was his brother. Would that some other had gained that distinction 
<A NAME="91"></A>instead of me! But after the army was gathered and come together, we still 
<A NAME="92"></A>remained at Aulis weather-bound; and Calchas, the seer, bade us in our 
<A NAME="93"></A>perplexity sacrifice my own begotten child Iphigenia to Artemis, whose 
<A NAME="94"></A>home is in this land, declaring that if we offered her, we should sail 
<A NAME="95"></A>and sack the Phrygians' capital, but if we forbore, this was not for us. 
<A NAME="96"></A>When I heard this, I commanded Talthybius with loud proclamation to disband 
<A NAME="97"></A>the whole host, as I could never bear to slay daughter of mine. Whereupon 
<A NAME="98"></A>my brother, bringing every argument to bear, persuaded me at last to face 
<A NAME="99"></A>the crime; so I wrote in a folded scroll and sent to my wife, bidding her 
<A NAME="100"></A>despatch our daughter to me on the pretence of wedding Achilles, it the 
<A NAME="101"></A>same time magnifying his exalted rank and saying that he refused to sail 
<A NAME="102"></A>with the Achaeans, unless a bride of our lineage should go to Phthia. Yes, 
<A NAME="103"></A>this was the inducement I offered my wife, inventing, as I did, a sham 
<A NAME="104"></A>marriage for the maiden. Of all the Achaeans we alone know the real truth, 
<A NAME="105"></A>Calchas, Odysseus, Menelaus and myself; but that which I then decided wrongly, 
<A NAME="106"></A>I now rightly countermand again in this scroll, which thou, old man, hast 
<A NAME="107"></A>found me opening and resealing beneath the shade of night. Up now and away 
<A NAME="108"></A>with this missive to Argos, and I will tell thee by word of mouth all that 
<A NAME="109"></A>is written herein, the contents of the folded scroll, for thou art loyal 
<A NAME="110"></A>to my wife and house. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="111"></A><B>ATTENDANT</B>
<A NAME="112"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Say on and make it plain, that what my tongue utters may accord 
<A NAME="113"></A>with what thou hast written. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="114"></A><B>AGAMEMNON</B>
<A NAME="115"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>"Daughter of Leda, in addition to my first letter I now send 
<A NAME="116"></A>thee word not to despatch thy daughter to Euboea's embosomed wing, to the 
<A NAME="117"></A>to the waveless bay of Aulis; for after all we wiltlelebrate our child's 
<A NAME="118"></A>wedding at another time." </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="119"></A><B>ATTENDANT</B>
<A NAME="120"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And how will Achilles, cheated of his bride, curb the fury 
<A NAME="121"></A>of his indignation against thee and thy wife? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="122"></A><B>AGAMEMNON</B>
<A NAME="123"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Here also is a danger. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="124"></A><B>ATTENDANT</B>
<A NAME="125"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Tell me what thou meanest. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="126"></A><B>AGAMEMNON</B>
<A NAME="127"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>It is but his name, not himself, that Achilles is lending, 
<A NAME="128"></A>knowing nothing of the marriage or of my scheming or my professed readiness 
<A NAME="129"></A>to betroth my daughter to him for a husband's embrace. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="130"></A><B>ATTENDANT</B>
<A NAME="131"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>A dreadful venture thine king Agamemnon! thou that, by promise 
<A NAME="132"></A>of thy daughter's hand to the son of the goddess, wert for bringing the 
<A NAME="133"></A>maid hither to be sacrificed for the Danai. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="134"></A><B>AGAMEMNON</B>
<A NAME="135"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Woe is me! ah woe! I am utterly distraught; bewilderment comes 
<A NAME="136"></A>o'er me. Away hurry thy steps, yielding nothing to old age.

<A NAME="143"></A><B>AGAMEMNON</B>
<A NAME="144"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And when thou passest any place where roads diverge, cast thine

<A NAME="146"></A>bearing my daughter hither to the ships of the Danai, and thou see it not.

<A NAME="163"></A><I>Enter CHORUS OF WOMEN OF CHALCIS.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="164"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="165"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>To the sandy beach of sea-coast Aulis I came after a voyage 
<A NAME="166"></A>through the tides of Euripus, leaving Chalcis on its narrow firth, my city 
<A NAME="167"></A>which feedeth the waters of far-famed Arethusa near the sea, that I might 
<A NAME="168"></A>behold the army of the Achaeans and the ships rowed by those god-like heroes; 
<A NAME="169"></A>for our husbands tell us that fair-haired Menelaus and high-born Agamemnon 
<A NAME="170"></A>are leading them to Troy on a thousand ships in quest of the lady Helen, 
<A NAME="171"></A>whom herdsman Paris carried off from the banks of reedy Eurotas-his guerdon 
<A NAME="172"></A>from Aphrodite, when that queen of Cyprus entered beauty's lists with Hera 
<A NAME="173"></A>and Pallas at the gushing fount.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>Through the grove of-Artemis, rich with sacrifice, I sped my course, 
<A NAME="175"></A>the red blush mantling on my cheeks from maiden modesty, in my eagerness 
<A NAME="176"></A>to see the soldiers' camp, the tents of the mail-clad Danai, and their 
<A NAME="177"></A>gathered steeds. Two chieftains there I saw met together in council; one 
<A NAME="178"></A>was Aias, son of Oileus; the other Aias, son of Telamon, crown of glory 
<A NAME="179"></A>to the men of Salamis; and I saw Protesilaus and Palamedes, sprung from 
<A NAME="180"></A>the son of Poseidon, sitting there amusing themselves with intricate figures 
<A NAME="181"></A>at draughts; Diomedes too at his favourite sport of hurling quoits; and 
<A NAME="182"></A>Meriones, the War-god's son, a marvel to mankind, stood at his side; likewise 
<A NAME="183"></A>I beheld the offspring of Laertes, who came from his island hills, and 
<A NAME="184"></A>with him Nireus, handsomest of all Achaeans; Achilles next, that nimble 
<A NAME="185"></A>runner, swift on his feet as the wind, whom Thetis bore and Chiron trained; 
<A NAME="186"></A>him I saw upon the beach, racing in full armour along the shingle and straining 
<A NAME="187"></A>every nerve to beat a team of four horses, as he sped round the track on 
<A NAME="188"></A>foot; and Eumelus, the grandson of Pheres, their driver, was shouting when 
<A NAME="189"></A>I saw him. goading on his goodly steeds, with their bits of chased goldwork; 
<A NAME="190"></A>whereof the centre pair, that bore the yoke, had dappled coats picked out 
<A NAME="191"></A>with white, while the trace-horses, on the outside, facing the turning-post 
<A NAME="192"></A>in the course, were bays with spotted fetlocks. Close beside them Peleus' 
<A NAME="193"></A>son leapt on his way, in all his harness, keeping abreast the rail by the 
<A NAME="194"></A>axle-box.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>Next I sought the countless fleet, a wonder to behold, that I might 
<A NAME="196"></A>fill my girlish eyes with gazing, a sweet delight. 'the warlike Myrmidons 
<A NAME="197"></A>from Phthia held the right wing with fifty swift cruisers, upon whose sterns, 
<A NAME="198"></A>right at the ends, stood Nereid goddesses in golden-effigy, the ensign 
<A NAME="199"></A>of Achilles' armament. Near these were moored the Argive ships in equal 
<A NAME="200"></A>numbers, o'er which Mecisteus' son, whom Taulaus his grandsire reared, 
<A NAME="201"></A>and Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, were in command; next in order, Theseus' 
<A NAME="202"></A>son was stationed at the head of sixty ships from Attica, having the goddess 
<A NAME="203"></A>Pallas set in a winged car drawn by steeds with solid hoof, a lucky sight 
<A NAME="204"></A>for mariners. Then I saw Boeotia's fleet of fifty sails decked with ensigns; 
<A NAME="205"></A>these had Cadmus at the stern holding a golden dragon at the beaks of the 
<A NAME="206"></A>vessels, and earth-born Leitus was their admiral. Likewise there were ships 
<A NAME="207"></A>from Phocis; and from Locris came the son of Oileus with an equal contingent, 
<A NAME="208"></A>leaving famed Thronium's citadel; and from Mycenae, the Cyclopes' town, 
<A NAME="209"></A>Atreus' son sent a hundred wellmanned galleys, his brother being with him 
<A NAME="210"></A>in command, as friend with friend, that Hellas might exact on her, who 
<A NAME="211"></A>had fled her home to wed a foreigner. Also I saw upon Gerenian Nestor's 
<A NAME="212"></A>prows twelve from Pylos the sign of his neighbor Alpheus, four-footed like 
<A NAME="213"></A>a bull. Moreover there was a squadron of Aenianian sail under King and 
<A NAME="214"></A>next the lords of Elis, stationed near'-them, whom all the people named 
<A NAME="215"></A>Epeians; and Eurytus was lord of these; likewise he led the Taphian warriors 
<A NAME="216"></A>with the white oar-blades, the subjects of Meges, son of Phyleus, who had 
<A NAME="217"></A>left the isles of the Echinades, where sailors cannot land. Lastly, Aias, 
<A NAME="218"></A>reared in Salamis, was joining his right wing to the left of those near 
<A NAME="219"></A>whom he was posted, closing the line with his outermost ships-twelve barques 
<A NAME="220"></A>obedient to the helm-as I heard and then saw the crews; no safe return 
<A NAME="221"></A>shall he obtain, who bringeth his barbaric boats to grapple Aias. There 
<A NAME="222"></A>I saw the naval armament, but some things I heard at home about the gathered 
<A NAME="223"></A>host, whereof I still have a recollection. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="301"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Aye, but a mind unstable is an unjust possession, disloyal 
<A NAME="302"></A>to friends. Now I am anxious to test thee, and seek not thou from rage 
<A NAME="303"></A>to turn aside from the truth, nor will I on my part overstrain the case. 
<A NAME="304"></A>Thou rememberest when thou wert all eagerness to captain the Danai against 
<A NAME="305"></A>Troy, making a pretence of declining, though eager for it in thy heart; 
<A NAME="306"></A>how humble thou wert then! taking each man by the hand and keeping open 
<A NAME="307"></A>doors for every fellow townsman who cared to enter, affording each in turn 
<A NAME="308"></A>a chance to speak with thee, even though some desired it not, seeking by 
<A NAME="309"></A>these methods to purchase popularity from all bidders; then when thou hadst 
<A NAME="310"></A>secured the command, there came a change over thy manners; thou wert no 
<A NAME="311"></A>longer so cordial before to whilom friends, but hard of access, seldom 
<A NAME="312"></A>to be found at home. But the man of real worth ought not to change his 
<A NAME="313"></A>manners in the hour of prosperity, but should then show himself most staunch 
<A NAME="314"></A>to friends, when his own good fortune can help them most effectually. This 
<A NAME="315"></A>was the first cause I had to reprove thee, for it was here I first discovered 
<A NAME="316"></A>thy villainy; but afterwards, when thou camest to Aulis with all the gathered 
<A NAME="317"></A>hosts of Hellas, thou wert of no account; no! the want of a favourable 
<A NAME="318"></A>breeze filled thee with consternation at the chance dealt out by Heaven. 
<A NAME="319"></A>Anon the Danai began demanding that thou shouldst send the fleet away instead 
<A NAME="320"></A>of vainly toiling on at Aulis; what dismay and confusion was then depicted 
<A NAME="321"></A>in thy looks, to think that thou, with a thousand ships at thy command, 
<A NAME="322"></A>hadst not occupied the plains of Priam with thy armies! And thou wouldst 
<A NAME="323"></A>ask my counsel, "What am I to do? what scheme can I devise. where find 
<A NAME="324"></A>one?" to save thyself being stripped of thy command and losing thy fair 
<A NAME="325"></A>fame. Next when Calchas bade thee offer thy daughter in sacrifice to Artemis, 
<A NAME="326"></A>declaring that the Danai should then sail, thou wert overjoyed, and didst 
<A NAME="327"></A>gladly undertake to offer the maid, and of thine own accord-never allege 
<A NAME="328"></A>compulsion!-thou art sending word to thy wife to despatch thy daughter 
<A NAME="329"></A>hither on pretence of wedding Achilles. This is the same air that heard 
<A NAME="330"></A>thee say it; and after all thou turnest round and hast been caught recasting 
<A NAME="331"></A>thy letter to this effect, "I will no longer be my daughter's murderer." 
<A NAME="332"></A>Exactly so! Countless others have gone through this phase in their conduct 
<A NAME="333"></A>of public affairs; they make an effort while in power, and then retire 
<A NAME="334"></A>dishonourably, sometimes owing to the senselessness of the citizens, sometimes 
<A NAME="335"></A>deservedly, because they are too feeble of themselves to maintain their 
<A NAME="336"></A>watch upon the state. For my part, I am more sorry for our unhappy Hellas, 
<A NAME="337"></A>whose purpose was to read these worthless foreigners a lesson, while now 
<A NAME="338"></A>she will let them escape and mock her, thanks to thee and thy daughter. 
<A NAME="339"></A>May I never then appoint a man to rule my country or lead its warriors 
<A NAME="340"></A>because his kinship! Ability what the general must have; since any man, 
<A NAME="341"></A>with ordinary intelligence, can govern a state. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="349"></A>these bloodshot eyes? who wrongs thee? what is it thou wantest? Thou art 
<A NAME="350"></A>fain to win a virtuous bride. Well, I cannot supply thee; for she, whom 
<A NAME="351"></A>thou once hadst, was ill controlled by thee. Am I then, a man who never 
<A NAME="352"></A>went astray, to suffer for thy sins? or is it my popularity that galls 
<A NAME="353"></A>thee? No! it is the longing thou hast to keep a fair wife in thy embrace, 
<A NAME="354"></A>casting reason and honour to the winds. A bad man's pleasures are like 
<A NAME="355"></A>himself Am I mad, if I change to wiser counsels, after previously deciding 
<A NAME="356"></A>amiss? Thine is the madness rather in wishing to recover a wicked wife, 
<A NAME="357"></A>once thou hadst lost her-a stroke of Heaven-sent luck. Those foolish suitors 
<A NAME="358"></A>swore that oath to Tyndareus in their longing to wed; but Hope was the 
<A NAME="359"></A>goddess that led them on, I trow, and she it was that brought it about 
<A NAME="360"></A>rather then thou and thy mightiness. So take the field with them; they 
<A NAME="361"></A>are ready for it in the folly of their hearts; for the deity is not without

<A NAME="417"></A>Ah, woe is me! unhappy wretch, what can I say? where shall I begin? Into

<A NAME="419"></A>far cleverer than any cunning of mine. What an advantage humble birth possesses! 
<A NAME="420"></A>for it is easy for her sons to weep and tell out all their sorrows; while 
<A NAME="421"></A>to the high-born man come these same sorrows, but we have dignity throned 
<A NAME="422"></A>o'er our life and are the people's slaves. I, for instance, am ashamed

<A NAME="1058"></A>this maiden perishes, she that hath suffered past endurance and been the 
<A NAME="1059"></A>victim of affronts most strangely undeserved. So am I made the poorest 
<A NAME="1060"></A>wretch in Argos; I a thing of naught, and Menelaus counting for a man! 
<A NAME="1061"></A>No son of Peleus I, but the issue of a vengeful fiend, if my name shall 
<A NAME="1062"></A>serve thy husband for the murder. Nay! by Nereus, who begat my mother Thetis, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>in his home amid the flowing waves, never shall king Agamemnon touch thy 
<A NAME="1064"></A>daughter, no! not even to the laying of a finger-tip upon her robe; else 
<A NAME="1065"></A>will Sipylus, that frontier town of barbarism, the cradle of those chieftains' 
<A NAME="1066"></A>line, be henceforth a city indeed, while Phthia's name will nowhere find 
<A NAME="1067"></A>mention. Calchas, the seer, shall rue beginning the sacrifice with his 
<A NAME="1068"></A>barley-meal and lustral water. Why, what is a seer? A man who with luck 
<A NAME="1069"></A>tells the truth sometimes, with frequent falsehoods, but when his luck 
<A NAME="1070"></A>deserts him, collapses then and there. It is not to secure a bride that 
<A NAME="1071"></A>I have spoken thus-there be maids unnumbered eager to have my love-no! 
<A NAME="1072"></A>but king Agamemnon has put an insult on me; he should have asked my leave 
<A NAME="1073"></A>to use my name as a means to catch the child, for it was I chiefly who 
<A NAME="1074"></A>induced Clytaemnestra to betroth her daughter to me; verily I had yielded 
<A NAME="1075"></A>this to Hellas, if that was where our going to Ilium broke down; I would 
<A NAME="1076"></A>never have refused to further my fellow soldiers' common interest. But, 
<A NAME="1077"></A>as it is, I am as naught in the eyes of those chieftains, and little they 
<A NAME="1078"></A>reck of treating me well or ill. My sword shall soon know if any one is 
<A NAME="1079"></A>to snatch thy daughter from me, for then will I make it reek with the bloody 
<A NAME="1080"></A>stains of slaughter, ere it reach Phrygia. Calm thyself then; as a god 
<A NAME="1081"></A>in his might I appeared to thee, without being so, but such will I show

<A NAME="1149"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="1150"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What wedding-hymn was that which raised its strains to the 
<A NAME="1151"></A>sound of Libyan flutes, to the music of the dancer's lyre, and the note 
<A NAME="1152"></A>of the pipe of reeds?
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR><BR>'Twas in the day Pieria's fair-tressed choir came o'er the slopes 
<A NAME="1154"></A>of Pelion to the marriage-feast of Peleus, beating the ground with print 
<A NAME="1155"></A>of golden sandals at the banquet of the gods, and hymning in dulcet strains 
<A NAME="1156"></A>the praise of Thetis and the son of Aeacus, o'er the Centaurs' hill, down 
<A NAME="1157"></A>through the woods of Pelion.
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR><BR>There was the Dardanian boy, Phrygian Ganymede, whom Zeus delights 
<A NAME="1159"></A>to honour, drawing off the wine he mixed in the depths of golden bowls; 
<A NAME="1160"></A>while, along the gleaming sand, the fifty daughters of Nereus graced the 
<A NAME="1161"></A>marriage with their dancing, circling in a mazy ring.
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR><BR>Came too the revel-rout of Centaurs, mounted on horses, to the 
<A NAME="1163"></A>feast of the gods and the mixing-bowl of Bacchus, leaning on fir-trees, 
<A NAME="1164"></A>with wreaths of green foliage round their heads; and loudly cried the prophet 
<A NAME="1165"></A>Chiron, skilled in arts inspired by Phoebus; "Daughter of Nereus, thou 
<A NAME="1166"></A>shalt bear a son"-whose name he gave-"a dazzling light to Thessaly; for 
<A NAME="1167"></A>he shall come with an army of spearmen to the far-famed land of Priam, 
<A NAME="1168"></A>to set it in a blaze, his body cased in a suit of golden mail forged by 
<A NAME="1169"></A>Hephaestus, a gift from his goddess-mother, even from Thetis who bore 
<A NAME="1170"></A>him."
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR><BR>Then shed the gods a blessing on the marriage of the high-born 
<A NAME="1172"></A>bride, who was first of Nereus' daughters, and on the wedding of Peleus. 
<A NAME="1173"></A>But thee, will Argives crown, wreathing the lovely tresses of thy hair, 
<A NAME="1174"></A>like a dappled mountain hind brought from some rocky cave or a heifer undefiled, 
<A NAME="1175"></A>and staining with blood thy human throat; though thou wert never reared 
<A NAME="1176"></A>like these amid the piping and whistling of herdsmen, but at thy mother's 
<A NAME="1177"></A>side, to be decked one day by her as the bride of a son of Inachus. Where 
<A NAME="1178"></A>now does the face of modesty or virtue avail aught? seeing that godlessness 
<A NAME="1179"></A>holds sway, and virtue is neglected by men and thrust behind them, lawlessness 
<A NAME="1180"></A>o'er law prevailing, and mortals no longer making common cause to keep 
<A NAME="1181"></A>the jealousy of gods from reaching them. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="1256"></A><B>CLYTAEMNESTRA</B>
<A NAME="1257"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Well, listen; for I will now unfold my meaning and no longer 
<A NAME="1258"></A>employ dark riddles. In the first place-to reproach thee first with this-it 
<A NAME="1259"></A>was not of my own free will but by force that thou didst take and wed me, 
<A NAME="1260"></A>after slaying Tantalus, my former husband, and dashing my babe on the ground 
<A NAME="1261"></A>alive, when thou hadst torn him from my breast with brutal violence. Then, 
<A NAME="1262"></A>when those two sons of Zeus, who were likewise my brothers, came flashing 
<A NAME="1263"></A>on horseback to war with thee, Tyndareus, my aged sire, rescued thee because 
<A NAME="1264"></A>of thy suppliant prayers, and thou in turn hadst me to wife. Once reconciled 
<A NAME="1265"></A>to thee upon this footing, thou wilt bear me witness I have been a blameless 
<A NAME="1266"></A>wife to thee and thy family, chaste in love, an honour to thy house, that 
<A NAME="1267"></A>so thy coming in might be with joy and thy going out with gladness. And 
<A NAME="1268"></A>'tis seldom a man secures a wife like this, though the getting of a worthless 
<A NAME="1269"></A>woman is no rarity.
<A NAME="1270"></A><BR><BR>Besides three daughters, of one of whom thou art heartlessly depriving 
<A NAME="1271"></A>me, I am the mother of this son of thine. If anyone asks thee thy reason 
<A NAME="1272"></A>for slaying her, tell me, what wilt thou say? or must say it for thee? 
<A NAME="1273"></A>"It is that Menelaus may recover Helen." An honourable exchange, indeed, 
<A NAME="1274"></A>to pay a wicked woman's price in children's lives! 'Tis buying what we 
<A NAME="1275"></A>most detest with what we hold most dear. Again, if thou go forth with the 
<A NAME="1276"></A>host, leaving me in thy halls, and art long absent at Troy, what will my 
<A NAME="1277"></A>feelings be at home, dost think? when I behold each vacant chair and her 
<A NAME="1278"></A>chamber now deserted, and then sit down alone in tears, making ceaseless 
<A NAME="1279"></A>lamentation for her, "Ah! my child, he that begat thee hath slain thee 
<A NAME="1280"></A>himself, he and no one else, nor was it by another's hand...to thy home, 
<A NAME="1281"></A>after leaving such a price to be paid; for it needs now but a trifling 
<A NAME="1282"></A>pretext for me and the daughters remaining to give thee the reception it 
<A NAME="1283"></A>is right thou shouldst receive. I adjure thee by the gods, compel me not 
<A NAME="1284"></A>to sin against thee, nor sin thyself. Go to; suppose thou sacrifice the 
<A NAME="1285"></A>child; what prayer wilt thou utter, when 'tis done? what will the blessing 
<A NAME="1286"></A>be that thou wilt invoke upon thyself as thou art slaying our daughter? 
<A NAME="1287"></A>an ill returning maybe, seeing the disgrace that speeds thy going forth. 
<A NAME="1288"></A>Is it right that I should pray for any luck to attend thee? Surely we should 
<A NAME="1289"></A>deem the gods devoid of sense, if we harboured a kindly feeling towards 
<A NAME="1290"></A>murderers. Shalt thou embrace thy children on thy coming back to Argos? 
<A NAME="1291"></A>Nay, thou hast no right. Will any child of thing e'er face thee, if thou 
<A NAME="1292"></A>have surrendered one of them to death? Has this ever entered into thy calculations, 
<A NAME="1293"></A>or does thy one duty consist in carrying a sceptre about and marching at 
<A NAME="1294"></A>the head of an army? when thou mightest have made this fair proposal among 
<A NAME="1295"></A>
