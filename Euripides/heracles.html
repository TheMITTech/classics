<A NAME="21"></A><B>AMPHITRYON</B>
<A NAME="22"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What mortal hath not heard of him who shared a wife with Zeus, 
<A NAME="23"></A>Amphitryon of Argos, whom on a day Alcaeus, son of Perseus begat, Amphitryon 
<A NAME="24"></A>the father of Heracles? He it was dwelt here in Thebes, where from the 
<A NAME="25"></A>sowing of the dragon's teeth grew up a crop of earth-born giants; for of 
<A NAME="26"></A>these Ares saved a scanty band, and their children's children people the 
<A NAME="27"></A>city of Cadmus. Hence sprung Creon, son of Menoeceus, king of this land; 
<A NAME="28"></A>and Creon became the father of this lady Megara, whom once all Cadmus' 
<A NAME="29"></A>race escorted with the glad music of lutes at her wedding, in the day that 
<A NAME="30"></A>Heracles, illustrious chief, led her to my halls. Now he, my son, left 
<A NAME="31"></A>Thebes where I was settled, left his wife Megara and her kin, eager to 
<A NAME="32"></A>make his home in Argolis, in that walled town which the Cyclopes built, 
<A NAME="33"></A>whence I am exiled for the slaying of Electryon; so he, wishing to lighten 
<A NAME="34"></A>my affliction and to find a home in his own land, did offer Eurystheus 
<A NAME="35"></A>a mighty price for my recall, even to free the world of savage monsters, 
<A NAME="36"></A>whether it was that Hera goaded him to submit to this, or that fate was 
<A NAME="37"></A>leagued against him. Divers are the toils he hath accomplished, and last 
<A NAME="38"></A>of all hath he passed through the mouth of Taenarus into the halls of Hades 
<A NAME="39"></A>to drag to the light that hound with bodies three, and thence is he never 
<A NAME="40"></A>returned. Now there is an ancient legend amongst the race of Cadmus, that 
<A NAME="41"></A>one Lycus in days gone by was husband to Dirce being king of this city 
<A NAME="42"></A>with its seven towers, before that Amphion and Zethus, sons of Zeus, lords 
<A NAME="43"></A>of the milk-white steeds, became rulers in the land. His son, called by 
<A NAME="44"></A>the same name as his father, albeit no Theban but a stranger from Euboea, 
<A NAME="45"></A>slew Creon, and after that seized the government, having fallen on this 
<A NAME="46"></A>city when weakened by dissension. So this connection with Creon is likely 
<A NAME="47"></A>to prove to us a serious evil; for now that my son is in the bowels of 
<A NAME="48"></A>the earth, this illustrious monarch Lycus is bent on extirpating the children 
<A NAME="49"></A>of Heracles, to quench one bloody feud with another, likewise his wife 
<A NAME="50"></A>and me, if useless age like mine is to rank amongst men, that the boys 
<A NAME="51"></A>may never grow up to exact a blood-penalty of their uncle's family. So 
<A NAME="52"></A>I, left here by my son, whilst he is gone into the pitchy darkness of the 
<A NAME="53"></A>earth, to tend and guard his children in his house, am taking my place 
<A NAME="54"></A>with their mother, that the race of Heracles may not perish, here at the 
<A NAME="55"></A>altar of Zeus the Saviour, which my own gallant child set up to commemorate 
<A NAME="56"></A>his glorious victory over the Minyae. And here we are careful to keep our 
<A NAME="57"></A>station, though in need of everything, of food, of drink, and raiment, 
<A NAME="58"></A>huddled together on the hard bare ground; for we are barred out from our 
<A NAME="59"></A>house and sit here for want of any other safety. As for friends, some I 
<A NAME="60"></A>see are insincere; while others, who are staunch, have no power to help 
<A NAME="61"></A>us further. This is what misfortune means to man; God grant it may never 
<A NAME="62"></A>fall to the lot of any who bears the least goodwill to me, to apply this 
<A NAME="63"></A>never-failing test of friendship! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="64"></A><B>MEGARA</B>
<A NAME="65"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Old warrior, who erst did raze the citadel of the Taphians 
<A NAME="66"></A>leading on the troops of Thebes to glory, how uncertain are God's dealings 
<A NAME="67"></A>with man! For I, as far as concerned my sire was never an outcast of fortune, 
<A NAME="68"></A>for he was once accounted a man of might by reason of his wealth, possessed 
<A NAME="69"></A>as he was of royal power, for which long spears are launched at the lives 
<A NAME="70"></A>of the fortunate through love of it; children too he had; and me did he 
<A NAME="71"></A>betroth to thy son, matching me in glorious marriage with Heracles. Whereas 
<A NAME="72"></A>now all that is dead and gone from us; and I and thou, old friend, art 
<A NAME="73"></A>doomed to die, and these children of Heracles, whom I am guarding 'neath 
<A NAME="74"></A>my wing as a bird keepeth her tender chicks under her. And they the while 
<A NAME="75"></A>in turn keep asking me, "Mother, whither is our father gone from the land? 
<A NAME="76"></A>what is he about? when will he return?" Thus they inquire for their father, 
<A NAME="77"></A>in childish perplexity; while I put them off with excuses, inventing stories; 
<A NAME="78"></A>but still I wonder if 'tis he whenever a door creaks on its hinges, and 
<A NAME="79"></A>up they all start, thinking to embrace their father's knees. What hope 
<A NAME="80"></A>or way of salvation art thou now devising, old friend? for to thee I look. 
<A NAME="81"></A>We can never steal beyond the boundaries of the land unseen, for there 
<A NAME="82"></A>is too strict a watch set on us at every outlet, nor have we any longer 
<A NAME="83"></A>hopes of safety in our friends. Whatever thy scheme is, declare it, lest 
<A NAME="84"></A>our death be made ready, while we are only prolonging the time, powerless 
<A NAME="85"></A>to escape. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="99"></A><B>AMPHITRYON</B>
<A NAME="100"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Daughter, there may yet be a happy escape from present troubles 
<A NAME="101"></A>for me and thee; my son, thy husband, may yet arrive. So calm thyself, 
<A NAME="102"></A>and wipe those tears from thy children's eyes, and soothe them with soft 
<A NAME="103"></A>words, inventing a tale to delude them, piteous though such fraud be. Yea, 
<A NAME="104"></A>for men's misfortunes ofttimes flag, and the stormy wind doth not always 
<A NAME="105"></A>blow so strong, nor are the prosperous ever so; for all things change, 
<A NAME="106"></A>making way for each other. The bravest man is he who relieth ever on his 
<A NAME="107"></A>hopes, but despair is the mark of a coward. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="114"></A>am but a voice and nothing more, a fancy bred of the visions of sleep by 
<A NAME="115"></A>night, palsied with age, yet meaning kindly. All hail! ye orphaned babes!

<A NAME="120"></A>the weight of a wheeled car. Take hold of hand or robe, whoso feels his 
<A NAME="121"></A>footsteps falter. Old friend, escort another like thyself, who erst amid 
<A NAME="122"></A>his toiling peers in the days of our youth would take his place beside 
<A NAME="123"></A>thee, no blot upon his country's glorious record.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>See, how like their father's sternly flash these children's eyes! 
<A NAME="125"></A>Misfortune, God wot, hath not failed his children, nor yet hath his comeliness

<A NAME="131"></A><B>LYCUS</B>
<A NAME="132"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>One question, if I may, to this father of Heracles and his 
<A NAME="133"></A>wife; and certainly as your lord and master I have a right to put what 
<A NAME="134"></A>questions choose. How long do ye seek to prolong your lives? What hope, 
<A NAME="135"></A>what succour do ye see to save you from death? Do you trust that these 
<A NAME="136"></A>children's father, who lies dead in the halls of Hades, will return? How 
<A NAME="137"></A>unworthily ye show your sorrow at having to die, thou 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="138"></A><I>to AMPHITRYON</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="139"></A>after thy idle boasts, scattered broadcast through Hellas, that Zeus was 
<A NAME="140"></A>partner in thy marriage-bed and there begat a new god; and thou 
<A NAME="141"></A> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="142"></A><I>to MEGARA</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="143"></A>after calling thyself the wife of so peerless a lord.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>After all, what was the fine exploit thy husband achieved, if he 
<A NAME="145"></A>did kil a hydra in a marsh or that monster of Nemea? which he caught in 
<A NAME="146"></A>a snare, for all he says he strangled it to death in his arms. Are these 
<A NAME="147"></A>your weapons for the hard struggle? Is it for this then that Heracles' 
<A NAME="148"></A>children should be spared? a man who has won a reputation for valour in 
<A NAME="149"></A>his contests with beasts, in all else a weakling; who ne'er buckled shield 
<A NAME="150"></A>to arm nor faced the spear, but with a bow, that coward's weapon, was ever 
<A NAME="151"></A>ready to run away. Archery is no test of manly bravery; no! he is a man 
<A NAME="152"></A>who keeps his post in the ranks and steadily faces the swift wound the 
<A NAME="153"></A>spear may plough. My policy, again, old man, shows no reckless cruelty, 
<A NAME="154"></A>but caution; for I am well aware I slew Creon, the father of Megara, and 
<A NAME="155"></A>am in possession of his throne. So I have no wish that these children should 
<A NAME="156"></A>grow up and be left to take vengeance on me in requital for what I have 
<A NAME="157"></A>done. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="158"></A><B>AMPHITRYON</B>
<A NAME="159"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>As for Zeus, let Zeus defend his son's case; but as for me, 
<A NAME="160"></A>Heracles, I am only anxious on thy behalf to prove by what I say this tyrant's 
<A NAME="161"></A>ignorance; for I cannot allow thee to be ill spoken of. First then for 
<A NAME="162"></A>that which should never have been said,-for to speak of thee Heracles as 
<A NAME="163"></A>coward is, methinks, outside the pale of speech,-of that must I clear the 
<A NAME="164"></A>with heaven to witness. I appeal then to the thunder of Zeus, and the chariot 
<A NAME="165"></A>wherein he rode, when he pierced the giants, earth's brood, to the heart 
<A NAME="166"></A>with his winged shafts, and with gods uplifted the glorious triumph-song; 
<A NAME="167"></A>or go to Pholoe and ask the insolent tribe of four-legged Centaurs, thou 
<A NAME="168"></A>craven king, ask them who they would judge their bravest foe; will they 
<A NAME="169"></A>not say my son, who according to thee is but a pretender? Wert thou to 
<A NAME="170"></A>ask Euboean Dirphys, thy native place, it would nowise sing thy praise, 
<A NAME="171"></A>for thou hast never done a single gallant deed to which thy country can 
<A NAME="172"></A>witness. Next thou dost disparage that clever invention, an archer's weapon; 
<A NAME="173"></A>come, listen to me and learn wisdom. A man who fights in line is a slave 
<A NAME="174"></A>to his weapons, and if his fellow-comrades want for courage he is slain 
<A NAME="175"></A>himself through the cowardice of his neighbours, or, if he break his spear, 
<A NAME="176"></A>he has not wherewithal to defend his body from death, having only one means 
<A NAME="177"></A>of defence; whereas all who are armed with the trusty bow, though they 
<A NAME="178"></A>have but one weapon, yet is it the best; for a man, after discharging countless 
<A NAME="179"></A>arrows, still has others wherewith to defend himself from death, and standing 
<A NAME="180"></A>at a distance keeps off the enemy, wounding them for all their watchfulness 
<A NAME="181"></A>with shafts invisible, and never exposing himself to the foe, but keeping 
<A NAME="182"></A>under cover; and this is far the wisest course in battle, to harm the enemy, 
<A NAME="183"></A>if they are not stationed out of shot, and keep safe oneself. These arguments 
<A NAME="184"></A>are completely opposite to thine with regard to the point at issue. Next, 
<A NAME="185"></A>why art thou desirous of slaying these children? What have they done to 
<A NAME="186"></A>thee? One piece of wisdom credit thee with, thy coward terror of a brave 
<A NAME="187"></A>man's descendants. Still it is hard on us, if for thy cowardice we must 
<A NAME="188"></A>die; a fate that ought to have overtaken thee at our braver hands, if Zeus 
<A NAME="189"></A>had been fairly disposed towards us. But, if thou art so anxious to make 
<A NAME="190"></A>thyself supreme in the land, let us at least go into exile; abstain from 
<A NAME="191"></A>all violence, else thou wilt suffer by it whenso the deity causes fortune's 
<A NAME="192"></A>breeze to veer round.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>Ah! thou land of Cadmus,-for to thee too will I turn, upbraiding 
<A NAME="194"></A>thee with words of reproach,-is this your succour of Heracles and his children? 
<A NAME="195"></A>the man who faced alone the Minyan host in battle and allowed Thebes to 
<A NAME="196"></A>see the light with freemen's eyes. I cannot praise Hellas, nor will I ever 
<A NAME="197"></A>keep silence, finding her so craven as regards my son; she should have 
<A NAME="198"></A>come with fire and sword and warrior's arms to help these tender babes, 
<A NAME="199"></A>to requite him for all his labours in purging land and sea. Such help, 
<A NAME="200"></A>my children, neither Hellas nor the city of Thebes affords you; to me a 
<A NAME="201"></A>feeble friend ye look, that am but empty sound and nothing more. For the 
<A NAME="202"></A>vigour which once I had, is gone from me; my limbs are palsied with age, 
<A NAME="203"></A>and my strength is decayed. Were I but young and still a man of my hands, 
<A NAME="204"></A>I would have seized my spear and dabbled those flaxen locks of his with 
<A NAME="205"></A>blood, so that the coward would now be flying from my prowes beyond the 
<A NAME="206"></A>bounds of Atlas. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="242"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Old sirs, I thank you; 'tis right that friends should feel 
<A NAME="243"></A>virtuous indignation on behalf of those they love; but do not on our account 
<A NAME="244"></A>vent your anger on the tyrant to your own undoing. Hear my advice, Amphitryon, 
<A NAME="245"></A>if haply there appear to thee to be aught in what I say. I love my children; 
<A NAME="246"></A>strange if I did not love those whom I laboured to bring forth! Death I 
<A NAME="247"></A>count a dreadful fate; but the man who wrestles with necessity I esteem 
<A NAME="248"></A>a fool. Since we must die, let us do so without being burnt alive, to furnish 
<A NAME="249"></A>our foes with food for merriment, which to my mind is an evil worse than 
<A NAME="250"></A>death; for many a fair guerdon do we owe our family. Thine has ever been 
<A NAME="251"></A>a warrior's fair fame, so 'tis not to be endured that thou shouldst die 
<A NAME="252"></A>a coward's death; and my husband's reputation needs no one to witness that 
<A NAME="253"></A>he would ne'er consent to save these children's lives by letting them incur 
<A NAME="254"></A>the stain of cowardice; for the noble are afflicted by disgrace on account 
<A NAME="255"></A>of their children, nor must I shrink from following my lord's example. 
<A NAME="256"></A>As to thy hopes consider how I weigh them. Thou thinkest thy son will return 
<A NAME="257"></A>from beneath the earth: who ever has come back from the dead out of the 
<A NAME="258"></A>halls of Hades? Thou hast a hope perhaps of softening this man by entreaty: 
<A NAME="259"></A>no, no! better to fly from one's enemy when he is so brutish, but yield 
<A NAME="260"></A>to men of breeding and wisdom; for thou wilt more easily obtain mercy there 
<A NAME="261"></A>by friendly overtures. True, a thought has already occurred to me that 
<A NAME="262"></A>we might by entreaty obtain a sentence of exile for the children; yet this 
<A NAME="263"></A>too is misery, to compass their deliverance with dire penury as the result; 
<A NAME="264"></A>for 'tis a saying that hosts look sweetly on banished friends for a day 
<A NAME="265"></A>and no more. Steel thy heart to die with us, for that awaits thee after 
<A NAME="266"></A>all. By thy brave soul I challenge thee, old friend; for whoso struggles 
<A NAME="267"></A>hard to escape destiny shows zeal no doubt, but 'tis zeal with a taint 
<A NAME="268"></A>of folly; for what must be, no one will ever avail to alter.

<A NAME="311"></A><I>strophe 1</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="312"></A>Phoebus is singing a plaintive dirge to drown his happier strains, striking 
<A NAME="313"></A>with key of gold his sweet-tongued lyre; so too am I fain to sing a song 
<A NAME="314"></A>of praise, a crown to all his toil, concerning him who is gone to the gloom 
<A NAME="315"></A>beneath the nether world, whether I am to call him son of Zeus or of Amphitryon. 
<A NAME="316"></A>For the praise of noble toils accomplished is a glory to the dead. First 
<A NAME="317"></A>he cleared the grove of Zeus of a lion, and put its skin upon his back, 
<A NAME="318"></A>hiding his auburn hair in its fearful gaping jaws; <BR><BR><I>antistrophe 
<A NAME="319"></A>1</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="320"></A>Then on a day, with murderous bow he wounded the race of wild Centaurs, 
<A NAME="321"></A>that range the hills, slaying them with winged shafts; Peneus, the river 
<A NAME="322"></A>of fair eddies, knows him well, and those far fields unharvested, and the 
<A NAME="323"></A>steadings on Pelion and they who haunt the glens of Homole bordering thereupon, 
<A NAME="324"></A>whence they rode forth to conquer Thessaly, arming themselves with pines 
<A NAME="325"></A>for clubs; likewise he slew that dappled hind with horns of gold, that 
<A NAME="326"></A>preyed upon the country-folk, glorifying Artemis, huntress queen of Oenoe; 
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR><I>strophe 2</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="328"></A>Next he mounted on a car and tamed with the bit the steeds of Diomede, 
<A NAME="329"></A>that greedily champed their bloody food at gory mangers with jaws unbridled, 
<A NAME="330"></A>devouring with hideous joy the flesh of men; then crossing Hebrus' silver 
<A NAME="331"></A>stream he still toiled on to perform the hests of the tyrant of Mycenae, 
<A NAME="332"></A>till he came to the strand of the Malian gulf by the streams of Anaurus, 
<A NAME="333"></A>where he slew with his arrows Cycnus, murderer of his guests, the savage 
<A NAME="334"></A>wretch who dwelt in Amphanae; <BR><BR><I>antistrophe 
<A NAME="335"></A>2</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="336"></A>Also he came to those minstrel maids, to their orchard in the west, to 
<A NAME="337"></A>pluck from the leafy apple-tree its golden fruit, when he had slain the 
<A NAME="338"></A>tawny dragon, whose awful coils were twined all round to guard it; and 
<A NAME="339"></A>he made his way into ocean's lairs, bringing calm to men that use the oar; 
<A NAME="340"></A>moreover he sought the home of Atlas, and stretched out his hands to uphold 
<A NAME="341"></A>the firmament, and on his manly shoulders took the starry mansions of the 
<A NAME="342"></A>gods; <BR><BR><I>strophe 3</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="343"></A>Then he went through the waves of heaving Euxine against the mounted host 
<A NAME="344"></A>of Amazons dwelling round Maeotis, the lake that is fed by many a stream, 
<A NAME="345"></A>having gathered to his standard all his friends from Hellas, to fetch the 
<A NAME="346"></A>gold-embroidered raiment of the warrior queen, a deadly quest for a girdle. 
<A NAME="347"></A>And Hellas won those glorious spoils of the barbarian maid, and safe in 
<A NAME="348"></A>Mycenae are they now. On Lerna's murderous hound, the many-headed hydra, 
<A NAME="349"></A>he set his branding-iron, and smeared its venom on his darts, wherewith 
<A NAME="350"></A>he slew the shepherd of Erytheia, a monster with three bodies; <BR><BR><I>antistrophe 
<A NAME="351"></A>3</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="352"></A>And many another glorious achievement he brought to a happy issue; to Hades' 
<A NAME="353"></A>house of tears hath he now sailed, the goal of his labours, where he is 
<A NAME="354"></A>ending his career of toil, nor cometh he thence again. Now is thy house 
<A NAME="355"></A>left without a friend, and Charon's boat awaits thy children to bear them 
<A NAME="356"></A>on that journey out of life, whence is no returning, contrary to God's 
<A NAME="357"></A>law and man's justice; and it is to thy prowess that thy house is looking 
<A NAME="358"></A>although thou art not here. Had I been strong and lusty, able to brandish 
<A NAME="359"></A>the spear in battle's onset, my Theban compeers too, I would have stood 
<A NAME="360"></A>by thy children to champion them; but now my happy youth is gone and I 
<A NAME="361"></A>am left.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>But lo! I see the children of Heracles who was erst so great, clad 
<A NAME="363"></A>in the vesture of the grave, and his loving wife dragging her babes along 
<A NAME="364"></A>at her side, and that hero's aged sire. Ah! woe is me! no longer can I

<A NAME="380"></A>and o'er thy head would he throw that lion's skin wherewith himself was 
<A NAME="381"></A>girt. Thou wert to be king of Thebes, famed for its chariots, receiving 
<A NAME="382"></A>as thy heritage my broad lands, for so thou didst coax thy father dear; 
<A NAME="383"></A>and to thy hand used he to resign the carved club, his sure defence, pretending 
<A NAME="384"></A>to give it thee. To thee he promised to give Oechalia, which once his archery 
<A NAME="385"></A>had wasted. Thus with three principalities would your father exalt you

<A NAME="393"></A>of your brides, a grim relationship to make. Ah me! which of you shall 
<A NAME="394"></A>I first press to my bosom, which last? on which bestow my kiss, or clasp 
<A NAME="395"></A>close to me? Oh! would that like the bee with russet wing, I could collect 
<A NAME="396"></A>from every source my sighs in one, and, blending them together, shed them 
<A NAME="397"></A>in one copious flood! Heracles, dear husband mine, to thee I call, if haply

<A NAME="842"></A><B>MESSENGER</B>
<A NAME="843"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Victims to purify the house were stationed before the altar 
<A NAME="844"></A>of Zeus, for Heracles had slain and cast from his halls the king of the 
<A NAME="845"></A>land. There stood his group of lovely children, with his sire and Megara; 
<A NAME="846"></A>and already the basket was being passed round the altar, and we were keeping 
<A NAME="847"></A>holy silence. But just as Alcmena's son was bringing the torch in his right 
<A NAME="848"></A>hand to dip it in the holy water, he stopped without a word. And as their 
<A NAME="849"></A>father lingered, his children looked at him; and lo! he was changed; his 
<A NAME="850"></A>eyes were rolling; he was distraught; his eyeballs were bloodshot and starting 
<A NAME="851"></A>from their sockets, and foam was oozing down his bearded cheek. Anon he 
<A NAME="852"></A>spoke, laughing the while a madman's laugh, "Father, why should I sacrifice 
<A NAME="853"></A>before I have slain Eurystheus, why kindle the purifying flame and have 
<A NAME="854"></A>the toil twice over, when I might at one stroke so fairly end it all? Soon 
<A NAME="855"></A>as I have brought the head of Eurystheus hither, I will cleanse my hands 
<A NAME="856"></A>for those already slain. Spill the water, cast the baskets from your hands. 
<A NAME="857"></A>Ho! give me now my bow and club! To famed Mycenae will I go; crow-bars 
<A NAME="858"></A>and pick-axes must I take, for I will heave from their very base with iron 
<A NAME="859"></A>levers those city-walls which the Cyclopes squared with red plumb-line 
<A NAME="860"></A>and mason's tools."
<A NAME="861"></A><BR><BR>Then he set out, and though he had no chariot there, he thought 
<A NAME="862"></A>he had, and was for mounting to its seat, and using a goad as though his 
<A NAME="863"></A>fingers really held one. A twofold feeling filled his servants' breasts, 
<A NAME="864"></A>half amusement, and half fear; and one looking to his neighbour said, "Is 
<A NAME="865"></A>our master making sport for us, or is he mad?" But he the while was pacing 
<A NAME="866"></A>to and fro in his house; and, rushing into the men's chamber, he thought 
<A NAME="867"></A>he had reached the city of Nisus, albeit he had gone into his own halls. 
<A NAME="868"></A>So he threw himself upon the floor, as if he were there, and made ready 
<A NAME="869"></A>to feast. But after waiting a brief space he began saying he was on his 
<A NAME="870"></A>way to the plains amid the valleys of the Isthmus; and then stripping himself 
<A NAME="871"></A>of his mantle, he fell to competing with an imaginary rival, o'er whom 
<A NAME="872"></A>he proclaimed himself victor with his own voice, calling on imaginary spectators 
<A NAME="873"></A>to listen. Next, fancy carrying him to Mycenae, he was uttering fearful 
<A NAME="874"></A>threats against Eurystheus. Meantime his father caught him by his stalwart 
<A NAME="875"></A>arm, and thus addressed him, "My son, what meanest thou hereby? What strange 
<A NAME="876"></A>doings are these? Can it be that the blood of thy late victims has driven 
<A NAME="877"></A>thee frantic?" But he, supposing it was the father of Eurystheus striving 
<A NAME="878"></A>in abject supplication to touch his hand, thrust him aside, and then against 
<A NAME="879"></A>his own children aimed his bow and made ready his quiver, thinking to slay 
<A NAME="880"></A>the sons of Eurystheus. And they in wild affright darted hither and thither, 
<A NAME="881"></A>one to his hapless mother's skirts, another to the shadow of a pillar, 
<A NAME="882"></A>while a third cowered 'neath the altar like a bird. Then cried their mother, 
<A NAME="883"></A>"O father, what art thou doing? dost mean to slay thy children?" Likewise 
<A NAME="884"></A>his aged sire and all the gathered servants cried aloud. But he, hunting 
<A NAME="885"></A>the child round and round, the column, in dreadful circles, and coming 
<A NAME="886"></A>face to face with him shot him to the heart; and he fell upon his back, 
<A NAME="887"></A>sprinkling the stone pillars with blood as he gasped out his life. Then 
<A NAME="888"></A>did Heracles shout for joy and boasted loud, "Here lies one of Eurystheus' 
<A NAME="889"></A>brood dead at my feet, atoning for his father's hate." Against a second 
<A NAME="890"></A>did he aim his bow, who had crouched at the altar's foot thinking to escape 
<A NAME="891"></A>unseen. But ere he fired, the poor child threw himself at his father's 
<A NAME="892"></A>knees, and, flinging his hand to reach his beard or neck, cried, "Oh! slay 
<A NAME="893"></A>me not, dear father mine! I am thy child, thine own; 'tis no son of Eurystheus 
<A NAME="894"></A>thou wilt slay."
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR>But that other, with savage Gorgon-scowl, as the child now stood 
<A NAME="896"></A>in range of his baleful archery, smote him on the head, as smites a smith 
<A NAME="897"></A>his molten iron, bringing down his club upon the fair-haired boy, and crushed 
<A NAME="898"></A>the bones. The second caught, away he hies to add a third victim to the 
<A NAME="899"></A>other twain. But ere he could, the poor mother caught up her babe and carried 
<A NAME="900"></A>him within the house and shut the doors; forthwith the madman, as though 
<A NAME="901"></A>he really were at the Cyclopean walls, prizes open the doors with levers, 
<A NAME="902"></A>and, hurling down their posts, with one fell shaft laid low his wife and 
<A NAME="903"></A>child. Then in wild career he starts to slay his aged sire; but lo! there 
<A NAME="904"></A>came a phantom,-so it seemed to us on-lookers,-Of Pallas, with plumed helm, 
<A NAME="905"></A>brandishing a spear; and she hurled a rock against the breast of Heracles, 
<A NAME="906"></A>which stayed him from his frenzied thirst for blood and plunged him into 
<A NAME="907"></A>sleep; to the ground he fell, smiting his back against a column that had 
<A NAME="908"></A>fallen on the floor in twain when the roof fell in. Thereon we rallied 
<A NAME="909"></A>from our flight, and with the old man's aid bound him fast with knotted 
<A NAME="910"></A>cords to the pillar, that on his awakening he might do no further evil. 
<A NAME="911"></A>So there he sleeps, poor wretch! a sleep that is not blest, having murdered 
<A NAME="912"></A>wife and children; nay, for my part know not any son of man more miserable

<A NAME="1240"></A>her aged sire. Now when the foundation is badly laid at birth, needs must 
<A NAME="1241"></A>the race be cursed with woe; and Zeus, whoever this Zeus may be, begot 
<A NAME="1242"></A>me as a butt for Hera's hate; yet be not thou vexed thereat, old man; for 
<A NAME="1243"></A>thee rather than Zeus do I regard as my father. Then whilst I was yet being 
<A NAME="1244"></A>suckled, that bride of Zeus did foist into my cradle fearsome snakes to 
<A NAME="1245"></A>compass my death. After I was grown to man's estate, of all the toils I 
<A NAME="1246"></A>then endured what need to tell? of all the lions, Typhons triple-bodied, 
<A NAME="1247"></A>and giants that I slew; or of the battle I won against the hosts of four-legged 
<A NAME="1248"></A>Centaurs? or how when I had killed the hydra, that monster with a ring 
<A NAME="1249"></A>of heads with power to grow again, I passed through countless other toils 
<A NAME="1250"></A>besides and came unto the dead to fetch to the light at the bidding of 
<A NAME="1251"></A>Eurystheus the three-headed hound, hell's porter. Last, ah, woe is me have 
<A NAME="1252"></A>I perpetrated this bloody deed to crown the sorrows of my house with my 
<A NAME="1253"></A>children's murder. To this sore strait am I come; no longer may I dwell 
<A NAME="1254"></A>in Thebes, the city that I love; for suppose I stay, to what temple or 
<A NAME="1255"></A>gathering of friends shall I repair? For mine is no curse that invites 
<A NAME="1256"></A>address. Shall I to Argos? how can I, when I am an exile from my country? 
<A NAME="1257"></A>Well, is there a single other city I can fly to? And if there were, am 
<A NAME="1258"></A>I to be looked at askance as a marked man, branded by cruel stabbing tongues,
