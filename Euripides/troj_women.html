<A NAME="20"></A><B>POSEIDON</B>
<A NAME="21"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Lo! From the depths of salt Aegean floods I, Poseidon, come, 
<A NAME="22"></A>where choirs of Nereids trip in the mazes of the graceful dance; for since 
<A NAME="23"></A>the day that Phoebus and myself with measurement exact set towers of stone 
<A NAME="24"></A>about this land of Troy and ringed it round, never from my heart hath passed 
<A NAME="25"></A>away a kindly feeling for my Phrygian town, which now is smouldering and 
<A NAME="26"></A>o'erthrown, a prey to Argive prowess. For, from his home beneath Parnassus, 
<A NAME="27"></A>Phocian Epeus, aided by the craft of Pallas, framed a horse to bear within 
<A NAME="28"></A>its womb an armed host, and sent it within the battlements, fraught with 
<A NAME="29"></A>death; whence in days to come men shall tell of "the wooden horse," with 
<A NAME="30"></A>its hidden load of warriors. Groves forsaken stand and temples of the gods 
<A NAME="31"></A>run down with blood, and at the altar's very base, before the god who watched 
<A NAME="32"></A>his home, lies Priam dead. While to Achaean ships great store of gold and 
<A NAME="33"></A>Phrygian spoils are being conveyed, and they who came against this town, 
<A NAME="34"></A>those sons Of Hellas, only wait a favouring breeze to follow in their wake, 
<A NAME="35"></A>that after ten long years they may with joy behold their wives and children. 
<A NAME="36"></A>Vanquished by Hera, Argive goddess, and by Athena, who helped to ruin Phrygia, 
<A NAME="37"></A>I am leaving Ilium, that famous town, and the altars that I love; for when 
<A NAME="38"></A>drear desolation seizes on a town, the worship of the gods decays and tends 
<A NAME="39"></A>to lose respect. Scamander's banks re-echo long and loud the screams of 
<A NAME="40"></A>captive maids, as they by lot receive their masters. Arcadia taketh some, 
<A NAME="41"></A>and some the folk of Thessaly; others are assigned to Theseus' sons, the 
<A NAME="42"></A>Athenian chiefs. And such of the Trojan dames as are not portioned out, 
<A NAME="43"></A>are in these tents, set apart for the leaders of the host; and with them 
<A NAME="44"></A>Spartan Helen, daughter of Tyndarus, justly counted among the captives. 
<A NAME="45"></A>And wouldst thou see that queen of misery, Hecuba, thou canst; for there 
<A NAME="46"></A>she lies before the gates, weeping many a bitter tear for many a tribulation; 
<A NAME="47"></A>for at Achilles' tomb-though she knows not this-her daughter Polyxena has 
<A NAME="48"></A>died most piteously; likewise is Priam dead, and her children too; Cassandra, 
<A NAME="49"></A>whom the king Apollo left to be a virgin, frenzied maid, hath Agamemnon, 
<A NAME="50"></A>in contempt of the god's ordinance and of piety, forced to a dishonoured 
<A NAME="51"></A>wedlock. Farewell, O city prosperous once! farewell, ye ramparts of hewn 
<A NAME="52"></A>stone! had not Pallas, daughter of Zeus, decreed thy ruin, thou wert standing 
<A NAME="53"></A>firmly still. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="54"></A><I>Enter ATHENA.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="55"></A><B>ATHENA</B>
<A NAME="56"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>May I address the mighty god whom Heaven reveres and who to 
<A NAME="57"></A>my own sire is very nigh in blood, laying aside our former enmity? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="58"></A><B>POSEIDON</B>
<A NAME="59"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Thou mayst; for o'er the soul the ties of kin exert no feeble 
<A NAME="60"></A>spell, great queen Athena. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="61"></A><B>ATHENA</B>
<A NAME="62"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>For thy forgiving mood my thanks! Somewhat have I to impart 
<A NAME="63"></A>affecting both thyself and me, O king. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="64"></A><B>POSEIDON</B>
<A NAME="65"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Bringst thou fresh tidings from some god, from Zeus, or from 
<A NAME="66"></A>some lesser power? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="67"></A><B>ATHENA</B>
<A NAME="68"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>From none of these; but on behalf of Troy, whose soil we tread, 
<A NAME="69"></A>am I come to seek thy mighty aid, to make it one with mine. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="70"></A><B>POSEIDON</B>
<A NAME="71"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What! hast thou laid thy former hate aside to take compassion 
<A NAME="72"></A>on the town now that it is burnt to ashes? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="73"></A><B>ATHENA</B>
<A NAME="74"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>First go back to the former point; wilt thou make common cause 
<A NAME="75"></A>with me in the scheme I purpose? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="76"></A><B>POSEIDON</B>
<A NAME="77"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ay surely; but I would fain learn thy wishes, whether thou 
<A NAME="78"></A>art come to help Achaens or Phrygians. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="79"></A><B>ATHENA</B>
<A NAME="80"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I wish to give my former foes, the Trojans, joy, and on the 
<A NAME="81"></A>Achaean host impose a return that they will rue. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="82"></A><B>POSEIDON</B>
<A NAME="83"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Why leap'st thou thus from mood to mood? Thy love and hate 
<A NAME="84"></A>both go too far, on whomsoever centred. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="85"></A><B>ATHENA</B>
<A NAME="86"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Dost not know the insult done to me and to the shrine I love? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="87"></A><B>POSEIDON</B>
<A NAME="88"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Surely, in the hour that Aias tore Cassandra thence. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="89"></A><B>ATHENA</B>
<A NAME="90"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Yea, and the Achaeans did naught, said naught to him. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="91"></A><B>POSEIDON</B>
<A NAME="92"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And yet 'twas by thy mighty aid they sacked Ilium. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="93"></A><B>ATHENA</B>
<A NAME="94"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>For which cause I would join with thee to work their bane. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="95"></A><B>POSEIDON</B>
<A NAME="96"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>My powers are ready at thy will. What is thy intent? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="97"></A><B>ATHENA</B>
<A NAME="98"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>A returning fraught with woe will I impose on them. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="99"></A><B>POSEIDON</B>
<A NAME="100"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>While yet they stay on shore, or as they cross the briny deep? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="101"></A><B>ATHENA</B>
<A NAME="102"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>When they have set sail from Ilium for their homes. On them 
<A NAME="103"></A>will Zeus also send his rain and fearful hail, and inky tempests from the 
<A NAME="104"></A>sky; yea, and he promises to grant me his levin-bolts to hurl on the Achaeans 
<A NAME="105"></A>and fire their ships. And do thou, for thy part, make the Aegean strait 
<A NAME="106"></A>to roar with mighty billows and whirlpools, and fill Euboea's hollow bay 
<A NAME="107"></A>with corpses, that Achaeans may learn henceforth to reverence my temples 
<A NAME="108"></A>and regard all other deities. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="109"></A><B>POSEIDON</B>
<A NAME="110"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>So shall it be, for the boon thou cravest needs but few words. 
<A NAME="111"></A>I will vex the broad Aegean sea; and the beach of Myconus and the reefs 
<A NAME="112"></A>round Delos, Scyros and Lemnos too, and the cliffs of Caphareus shall be 
<A NAME="113"></A>strown with many a corpse. Mount thou to Olympus, and taking from thy father's 
<A NAME="114"></A>hand his lightning bolts, keep careful watch against the hour when Argos' 
<A NAME="115"></A>host lets slip its cables. A fool is he who sacks the towns of men, with 
<A NAME="116"></A>shrines and tombs, the dead man's hallowed home, for at the last he makes 
<A NAME="117"></A>a desert round himself, and dies. Exeunt. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="118"></A><B>HECUBA </B>
<A NAME="119"></A><I>Awakening</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="120"></A>Lift thy head, unhappy lady, from the ground; thy neck upraise; this is 
<A NAME="121"></A>Troy no more, no longer am I queen in Ilium. Though fortune change, endure 
<A NAME="122"></A>thy lot; sail with the stream, and follow fortune's tack, steer not thy 
<A NAME="123"></A>barque of life against the tide, since chance must guide thy course. Ah 
<A NAME="124"></A>me! ah me! What else but tears is now my hapless lot, whose country, children, 
<A NAME="125"></A>husband, all are lost? Ah! the high-blown pride of ancestors! how cabined 
<A NAME="126"></A>now how brought to nothing after all What woe must I suppress, or what 
<A NAME="127"></A>declare? What plaintive dirge shall I awake? Ah, woe is me! the anguish 
<A NAME="128"></A>I suffer lying here stretched upon this pallet hard! O my head, my temples, 
<A NAME="129"></A>my side! Ah! could I but turn over, and he now on this, now on that, to 
<A NAME="130"></A>rest my back and spine, while ceaselessly my tearful wail ascends. Fore 
<A NAME="131"></A>'en this is music to the wretched, to chant their cheerless dirge of 
<A NAME="132"></A>sorrow.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>Ye swift-prowed ships, rowed to sacred Ilium o'er the deep dark 
<A NAME="134"></A>sea, past the fair havens of Hellas, to the flute's ill-omened music and 
<A NAME="135"></A>the dulcet voice of pipes, even to the bays of Troyland (alack the day!), 
<A NAME="136"></A>wherein ye tied your hawsers, twisted handiwork from Egypt, in quest of 
<A NAME="137"></A>that hateful wife of Menelaus, who brought disgrace on Castor, and on Eurotas 
<A NAME="138"></A>foul reproach; murderess she of Priam, sire of fifty children, the cause 
<A NAME="139"></A>why I, the hapless Hecuba, have wrecked my life upon this troublous strand. 
<A NAME="140"></A>Oh that I should sit here o'er against the tent of Agamemnon Forth from 
<A NAME="141"></A>my home to slavery they hale my aged frame, while from my head in piteous 
<A NAME="142"></A>wise the hair is shorn for grief. Ah! hapless wives of those mail-clad 
<A NAME="143"></A>sons of Troy! Ah! poor maidens, luckless brides, come weep, for Ilium is 
<A NAME="144"></A>now but a ruin; and I, like some mother-bird that o're her fledglings screams, 
<A NAME="145"></A>will begin the strain; how different from that song I sang to the gods 
<A NAME="146"></A>in days long past, as I leaned on Priam's staff, and beat with my foot 
<A NAME="147"></A>in Phrygian time to lead the dance! </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="149"></A><B>SEMI-CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="150"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>O Hecuba why these cries, these piercing shrieks? What mean 
<A NAME="151"></A>thy words? For I heard thy piteous wail echo through the building, and 
<A NAME="152"></A>a pang terror shoots through each captive Trojan's breast, as pent within 
<A NAME="153"></A>these walls they mourn their slavish lot. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="154"></A><B>HECUBA</B>
<A NAME="155"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>My child, e'en now the hands of Argive rowers are busy at their

<A NAME="157"></A><B>SEMI-CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="158"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ah, woe is me! what is their intent? Will they really bear

<A NAME="161"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I know not, though I guess our doom. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="162"></A><B>SEMI-CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="163"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>O misery! woe to us Trojan dames, soon to hear the order given, 
<A NAME="164"></A>"Come forth from the house; the Argives are preparing to return." 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="165"></A><B>HECUBA</B>
<A NAME="166"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh! do not bid the wild Cassandra leave her chamber, the frantic 
<A NAME="167"></A>prophetess, for Argives to insult, nor to my griefs add yet another. Woe 
<A NAME="168"></A>to thee, ill-fated Troy, thy sun is set; and woe to thy unhappy children, 
<A NAME="169"></A>quick and dead alike, who are leaving thee behind! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="170"></A><B>SEMI-CHORUS II</B>
<A NAME="171"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>With trembling step, alas! I leave this tent of Agamemnon to 
<A NAME="172"></A>learn of thee, my royal mistress, whether the Argives have resolved to 
<A NAME="173"></A>take my wretched life, whether the sailors at the prow are making ready 
<A NAME="174"></A>to ply their oars. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="175"></A><B>HECUBA</B>
<A NAME="176"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>My child, a fearful dread seized on my wakeful heart and sent 
<A NAME="177"></A>me hither. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="178"></A><B>SEMI-CHORUS II</B>
<A NAME="179"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Hath a herald from the Danai already come? To whom am I, poor 
<A NAME="180"></A>captive, given as a slave? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="182"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Thou art not far from being allotted now.

<A NAME="184"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Woe worth the day! What Argive or Phthiotian chief will bear

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="186"></A><B>HECUBA</B>
<A NAME="187"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ah me! ah me! Whose slave shall I become in my old age? in 
<A NAME="188"></A>what far clime? a poor old drone, the wretched copy of a corpse, set to 
<A NAME="189"></A>keep the gate or tend their children, I who once held royal rank in Troy. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="190"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="191"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Woe, woe is thee! What piteous dirge wilt thou devise to mourn 
<A NAME="192"></A>the outrage done thee? No more through Ida's looms shall I-ply the shuttle 
<A NAME="193"></A>to and fro. I look my last and latest on my children's bodies; henceforth 
<A NAME="194"></A>shall I endure surpassing misery; it may be as the unwilling bride of some 
<A NAME="195"></A>Hellene (perish the night and fortune that brings me to this!); it may 
<A NAME="196"></A>be as a wretched slave I from Peirene's sacred fount shall draw their store 
<A NAME="197"></A>of water.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>Oh be it ours to come to Theseus' famous realm, a land of joy! 
<A NAME="199"></A>Never, never let me see Eurotas' swirling tide, hateful home of Helen, 
<A NAME="200"></A>there to meet and be the slave of Menelaus, whose hand laid Troyland waste! 
<A NAME="201"></A>Yon holy land by Peneus fed, nestling in all its beauty at Olympus' foot, 
<A NAME="202"></A>is said, so have I heard, to be a very granary of wealth and teeming fruitage; 
<A NAME="203"></A>next to the sacred soil of Theseus, I could wish to reach that land. They 
<A NAME="204"></A>tell me too Hephaestus' home, beneath the shadow of Aetna, fronting Phoenicia, 
<A NAME="205"></A>the mother of Sicilian hills, is famous for the crowns it gives to worth. 
<A NAME="206"></A>Or may I find a home on that shore which lieth very nigh Ionia's sea, a 
<A NAME="207"></A>land by Crathis watered, lovely stream, that dyes the hair an auburn tint, 
<A NAME="208"></A>feeding with its holy waves and making glad therewith the home of heroes 
<A NAME="209"></A>good and true.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>But mark! a herald from the host of Danai, with store of fresh 
<A NAME="211"></A>proclamations, comes hasting hither. What is his errand? what saith he? 
<A NAME="212"></A>List, for we are slaves to Dorian lords henceforth.

<A NAME="343"></A>will so far rise above my frantic fit, that I will prove this city happier 
<A NAME="344"></A>far than those Achaeans, who for the sake of one woman and one man's love 
<A NAME="345"></A>of her have lost a countless host in seeking Helen. Their captain too, 
<A NAME="346"></A>whom men call wise, hath lost for what he hated most what most he prized, 
<A NAME="347"></A>yielding to his brother for a woman's sake-and she a willing prize whom 
<A NAME="348"></A>no man forced-the joy he had of his own children in his home. For from 
<A NAME="349"></A>the day that they did land upon Scamander's strand, their doom began, not 
<A NAME="350"></A>for loss of stolen frontier nor yet for fatherland with frowning towers; 
<A NAME="351"></A>whomso Ares slew, those never saw their babes again, nor were they shrouded 
<A NAME="352"></A>for the tomb by hand of wife, but in a foreign land they lie. At home the 
<A NAME="353"></A>case was still the same; wives were dying widows, parents were left childless 
<A NAME="354"></A>in their homes, having reared their sons for others, and none is left to 
<A NAME="355"></A>make libations of blood upon the ground before their tombs. Truly to such 
<A NAME="356"></A>praise as this their host can make an ample claim. Tis better to pass their 
<A NAME="357"></A>shame in silence by, nor be mine the Muse to tell that evil tale. But the 
<A NAME="358"></A>Trojans were dying, first for their fatherland, fairest fame to win; whomso 
<A NAME="359"></A>the sword laid low, all these found friends to bear their bodies home and 
<A NAME="360"></A>were laid to rest in the bosom of their native land, their funeral rites 
<A NAME="361"></A>all duly paid by duteous hands. And all such Phrygians as escaped the warrior's 
<A NAME="362"></A>death lived ever day by day with wife and children by them-joys the Achaeans 
<A NAME="363"></A>had left behind. As for Hector and his griefs, prithee hear how stands 
<A NAME="364"></A>the case; he is dead and gone, but still his fame remains as bravest of 
<A NAME="365"></A>the brave, and this was a result of the Achaeans' coming; for had they 
<A NAME="366"></A>remained at home, his worth would have gone unnoticed. So too with Paris, 
<A NAME="367"></A>he married the daughter of Zeus, whereas, had he never done so, the alliance 
<A NAME="368"></A>he made in his family would have been forgotten. Whoso is wise should fly 
<A NAME="369"></A>from making war; but if he be brought to this pass, a noble death will 
<A NAME="370"></A>crown his city with glory, a coward's end with shame. Wherefore, mother

<A NAME="467"></A>its trappings of gold and its freight of warriors; and our folk cried out

<A NAME="469"></A>drag this sacred image to the shrine of the Zeus-born maiden, goddess of 
<A NAME="470"></A>our Ilium!" Forth from his house came every youth and every grey-head too; 
<A NAME="471"></A>and with songs of joy they took the fatal snare within. Then hastened all 
<A NAME="472"></A>the race of Phrygia to the gates, to make the goddess a present of an Argive 
<A NAME="473"></A>band ambushed in the polished mountain-pine, Dardania's ruin, a welcome 
<A NAME="474"></A>gift to be to her, the virgin queen of deathless steeds; and with nooses 
<A NAME="475"></A>of cord they dragged it, as it had been a ship's dark hull, to the stone-built 
<A NAME="476"></A>fane of the goddess Pallas, and set it on that floor so soon to drink our 
<A NAME="477"></A>country's blood. But, as they laboured and made merry, came on the pitchy 
<A NAME="478"></A>night; loud the Libyan flute was sounding, and Phrygian songs awoke, while

<A NAME="480"></A>and in the halls a blaze of torchlight shed its flickering shadows on sleeping 
<A NAME="481"></A>eyes. In that hour around the house was I singing as I danced to that maiden

<A NAME="486"></A>and desolation reigned o'er every bed where young men lay beheaded, a glorious

<A NAME="599"></A>been born and to be dead, and better far is death than life with misery. 
<A NAME="600"></A>For the dead feel no sorrow any more and know no grief; but he who has 
<A NAME="601"></A>known prosperity and has fallen on evil days feels his spirit straying 
<A NAME="602"></A>from the scene of former joys. Now that child of thine is dead as though 
<A NAME="603"></A>she ne'er had seen the light, and little she recks of her calamity; whereas 
<A NAME="604"></A>I, who aimed at a fair repute, though I won a higher lot than most, yet 
<A NAME="605"></A>missed my lick in life. For all that stamps the wife a woman chaste, I 
<A NAME="606"></A>strove to do in Hector's home. In the first place, whether there is a slur 
<A NAME="607"></A>upon a woman, or whether there is not, the very fact of her not staying 
<A NAME="608"></A>at home brings in its train an evil name; therefore I gave up any wish 
<A NAME="609"></A>to do so, and abode ever within my house, nor would I admit the clever 
<A NAME="610"></A>gossip women love, but conscious of a heart that told an honest tale I 
<A NAME="611"></A>was content therewith. And ever would I keep a silent tongue and modest 
<A NAME="612"></A>eye before my lord; and well I knew where I might rule my lord, and where 
<A NAME="613"></A>'twas best to yield to him; the fame whereof hath reached the Achaean host, 
<A NAME="614"></A>and proved my ruin; for when I was taken captive, Achilles' son would have 
<A NAME="615"></A>me as his wife, and I must serve in the house of murderers. And if I set 
<A NAME="616"></A>aside my love for Hector, and ope my heart to this new lord, I shall appear 
<A NAME="617"></A>a traitress to the dead, while, if I hate him, I shall incur my master's 
<A NAME="618"></A>displeasure. And yet they say a single night removes a woman's dislike 
<A NAME="619"></A>for her husband; nay, I do hate the woman who, when she hath lost her former 
<A NAME="620"></A>lord, transfers her love by marrying another. Not e'en the horse, if from 
<A NAME="621"></A>his fellow torn, will cheerfully draw the yoke; and yet the brutes have 
<A NAME="622"></A>neither speech nor sense to help them, and are by nature man's inferiors. 
<A NAME="623"></A>O Hector mine! in thee I found a husband amply dowered with wisdom, noble 
<A NAME="624"></A>birth and fortune, a brave man and a mighty; whilst thou didst take me 
<A NAME="625"></A>from my father's house a spotless bride, thyself the first to make this 
<A NAME="626"></A>maiden wife. But now death hath claimed thee, and I to Hellas am soon to 
<A NAME="627"></A>sail, a captive doomed to wear the yoke of slavery. Hath not then the dead 
<A NAME="628"></A>Polyxena, for whom thou wailest, less evil to bear than I? I have not so 
<A NAME="629"></A>much as hope, the last resource of every human heart, nor do I beguile 
<A NAME="630"></A>myself with dreams of future bliss, the very thought whereof is sweet.

<A NAME="823"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>This boon needs leisure; still, if she wishes to speak, the

<A NAME="827"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Perhaps thou wilt not answer me, from counting me a foe, whether 
<A NAME="828"></A>my words seem good or ill. Yet will I put my charges and thine over against 
<A NAME="829"></A>each other, and then reply to the accusations I suppose thou wilt advance 
<A NAME="830"></A>against me. First, then, she was the author of these troubles by giving 
<A NAME="831"></A>birth to Paris; next, old Priam ruined Troy and me, because he did not 
<A NAME="832"></A>slay his babe Alexander, baleful semblance of a fire-brand, long ago. Hear 
<A NAME="833"></A>what followed. This Paris was to judge the claims of three rival goddesses; 
<A NAME="834"></A>so Pallas offered him command of all the Phrygians, and the destruction 
<A NAME="835"></A>of Hellas; Hera promised he should spread his dominion over Asia, and the 
<A NAME="836"></A>utmost bounds of Europe, if he would decide for her; but Cypris spoke in 
<A NAME="837"></A>rapture of my loveliness, and promised him this boon, if she should have 
<A NAME="838"></A>the preference o'er those twain for beauty; now mark the inference I deduce 
<A NAME="839"></A>from this; Cypris won the day o'er them, and thus far hath my marriage 
<A NAME="840"></A>proved of benefit to Hellas, that ye are not subject to barbarian rule, 
<A NAME="841"></A>neither vanquished in the strife, nor yet by tyrants crushed. What Hellas 
<A NAME="842"></A>gained, was ruin to me, a victim for my beauty sold, and now am I reproached 
<A NAME="843"></A>for that which should have set a crown upon my head. But thou wilt say 
<A NAME="844"></A>I am silent on the real matter at issue, how it was I started forth and 
<A NAME="845"></A>left thy house by stealth. With no mean goddess at his side he came, my 
<A NAME="846"></A>evil genius, call him Alexander or Paris, as thou wilt; and him didst thou, 
<A NAME="847"></A>thrice guilty wretch, leave behind thee in thy house, and sail away from 
<A NAME="848"></A>Sparta to the land of Crete. Enough of this! For all that followed I must 
<A NAME="849"></A>question my own heart, not thee; what frantic thought led me to follow 
<A NAME="850"></A>the stranger from thy house, traitress to my country and my home? Punish 
<A NAME="851"></A>the goddess, show thyself more mighty e'en than Zeus, who, though he lords 
<A NAME="852"></A>it o'er the other gods, is yet her slave; wherefore I may well be pardoned. 
<A NAME="853"></A>Still, from hence thou mightest draw a specious argument against me; when 
<A NAME="854"></A>Paris died, and Earth concealed his corpse, I should have left his house 
<A NAME="855"></A>and sought the Argive fleet, since my marriage was no longer in the hands 
<A NAME="856"></A>of gods. That was what I fain had done; yea, and the warders on the towers 
<A NAME="857"></A>and watchmen on the walls can bear me witness, for oft they found me seeking 
<A NAME="858"></A>to let myself down stealthily by cords from the battlements; but there 
<A NAME="859"></A>was that new husband, Deiphobus, that carried me off by force to be his 
<A NAME="860"></A>wife against the will of Troy. How then, my lord, could I be justly put 
<A NAME="861"></A>to death by thee, with any show of right, seeing that he wedded me against 
<A NAME="862"></A>my will, and those my other natural gifts have served a bitter slavery, 
<A NAME="863"></A>instead of leading on to triumph? If 'tis thy will indeed to master gods, 
<A NAME="864"></A>that very wish displays thy folly. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="869"></A><B>HECUBA</B>
<A NAME="870"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>First will I take up the cause of those goddesses, and prove 
<A NAME="871"></A>how she perverts the truth. For I can ne'er believe that Hera or the maiden 
<A NAME="872"></A>Pallas would have been guilty of such folly, as to sell, the one, her Argos 
<A NAME="873"></A>to barbarians, or that Pallas e'er would make her Athens subject to the 
<A NAME="874"></A>Phrygians, coming as they did in mere wanton sport to Ida to contest the 
<A NAME="875"></A>palm of beauty. For why should goddess Hera set her heart so much on such 
<A NAME="876"></A>a prize? Was it to win a nobler lord than Zeus? or was Athena bent on finding 
<A NAME="877"></A>'mongst the gods a husband, she who in her dislike of marriage won from 
<A NAME="878"></A>her sire the boon of remaining unwed? Seek not to impute folly to the goddesses, 
<A NAME="879"></A>in the attempt to gloze o'er thy own sin; never wilt thou persuade the 
<A NAME="880"></A>wise. Next thou hast said-what well may make men jeer-that Cypris came 
<A NAME="881"></A>with my son to the house of Menelaus. Could she not have stayed quietly 
<A NAME="882"></A>in heaven and brought thee and Amyclae to boot to Ilium? Nay! my son was 
<A NAME="883"></A>passing fair, and when thou sawest him thy fancy straight became thy Cypris; 
<A NAME="884"></A>for every sensual act that men commit, they lay upon this goddess, and 
<A NAME="885"></A>rightly does her name of Aphrodite begin the word for "senselessness"; 
<A NAME="886"></A>so when thou didst catch sight of him in gorgeous foreign garb, ablaze 
<A NAME="887"></A>with gold, thy senses utterly forsook thee. Yea, for in Argos thou hadst 
<A NAME="888"></A>moved in simple state, but, once free of Sparta, 'twas thy fond hope to 
<A NAME="889"></A>deluge by thy lavish outlay Phrygia's town, that flowed with gold; nor 
<A NAME="890"></A>was the palace of Menelaus rich enough for thy luxury to riot in. Ha! my 
<A NAME="891"></A>son carried thee off by force, so thou savest; what Spartan saw this? what 
<A NAME="892"></A>cry for help didst thou ever raise, though Castor was still alive, a vigorous 
<A NAME="893"></A>youth, and his brother also, not yet amid the stars? Then when thou wert 
<A NAME="894"></A>come to Troy, and the Argives were on thy track, and the mortal combat 
<A NAME="895"></A>was begun, whenever tidings came to thee of Menelaus' prowess, him wouldst 
<A NAME="896"></A>thou praise, to grieve my son, because he had so powerful a rival in his 
<A NAME="897"></A>love; but if so the Trojans prospered, Menelaus was nothing to thee. Thy 
<A NAME="898"></A>eye was fixed on Fortune, and by such practice wert thou careful to follow 
<A NAME="899"></A>in her steps, careless of virtue's cause. And then, in spite of all, thou 
<A NAME="900"></A>dost assert that thou didst try to let thyself down from the towers by 
<A NAME="901"></A>stealth with twisted cords, as if loth to stay? Pray then, wert thou ever 
<A NAME="902"></A>found fastening the noose about thy neck, or whetting the knife, as noble 
<A NAME="903"></A>wife would have done in regret for her former husband? And yet full oft 
<A NAME="904"></A>I advised thee saying, "Get thee gone, daughter, and let my sons take other 
<A NAME="905"></A>brides; I will help thee to steal away, and convey thee to the Achaean 
<A NAME="906"></A>fleet; oh end the strife 'twixt us and Hellas!" But this was bitter in 
<A NAME="907"></A>thy ears. For thou wert wantoning in Alexander's house, fain to have obeisance 
<A NAME="908"></A>done thee by barbarians. Yes, 'twas a proud time for thee; and now after 
<A NAME="909"></A>all this thou hast bedizened thyself, and come forth and hast dared to 
<A NAME="910"></A>appear under the same sky as thy husband, revolting wretchl Better hadst 
<A NAME="911"></A>thou come in tattered raiment, cowering humbly in terror, with hair shorn 
<A NAME="912"></A>short, if for thy past sins thy feeling were one of shame rather than effrontery.

<A NAME="1095"></A>nor ever sung in Muses' songs, furnishing to bards of after-days a subject 
<A NAME="1096"></A>for their minstrelsy. Go, bury now in his poor tomb the dead, wreathed 
<A NAME="1097"></A>all duly as befits a corpse. And yet I deem it makes but little difference 
<A NAME="1098"></A>to the dead, although they get a gorgeous funeral; for this is but a cause 
<A NAME="1099"></A>of idle pride to the living.

<A NAME="1102"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Alas! for thy unhappy mother, who o'er thy corpse hath closed 
<A NAME="1103"></A>the high hopes of her life! Born of a noble stock, counted most happy in 
<A NAME="1104"></A>thy lot, ah! what a tragic death is thine! Ha! who are those I see on yonder 
<A NAME="1105"></A>pinnacles darting to and fro with flaming torches in their hands? Some 
<A NAME="1106"></A>new calamity will soon on Troy alight. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="1110"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ye captains, whose allotted task it is to fire this town of 
<A NAME="1111"></A>Priam, to you I speak. No longer keep the firebrand idle in your hands, 
<A NAME="1112"></A>but launch the flame, that when we have destroyed the city of Ilium we 
<A NAME="1113"></A>may set forth in gladness on our homeward voyage from Troy. And you, ye 
<A NAME="1114"></A>sons of Troy-to let my orders take at once a double form-start for the 
<A NAME="1115"></A>Achaean ships for your departure hence, soon as ever the leaders of the

<A NAME="1118"></A>to him thou art assigned by lot to be a slave far from thy country.

<A NAME="1120"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ah, woe is me! This surely is the last, the utmost limit this, 
<A NAME="1121"></A>of all my sorrows; forth from my land I go; my city is ablaze with flame. 
<A NAME="1122"></A>Yet, thou aged foot, make one painful struggle to hasten, that I may say 
<A NAME="1123"></A>a farewell to this wretched town. O Troy, that erst hadst such a grand 
<A NAME="1124"></A>career amongst barbarian towns, soon wilt thou be reft of that splendid 
<A NAME="1125"></A>name. Lo! they are burning thee, and leading us e'en now from our land 
<A NAME="1126"></A>to slavery. Great gods! Yet why call on the gods? They did not hearken 
<A NAME="1127"></A>e'en aforetime to our call. Come, let us rush into the flames, for to die 
<A NAME="1128"></A>with my country in its blazing ruin were a noble death for me.
