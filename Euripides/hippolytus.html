<A NAME="20"></A><B>APHRODITE</B>
<A NAME="21"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Wide o'er man my realm extends, and proud the name that I, 
<A NAME="22"></A>the goddess Cypris, bear, both in heaven's courts and 'mongst all those 
<A NAME="23"></A>who dwell within the limits of the sea and the bounds of Atlas, beholding 
<A NAME="24"></A>the sun-god's light; those that respect my power I advance to honour, but 
<A NAME="25"></A>bring to ruin all who vaunt themselves at me. For even in the race of gods 
<A NAME="26"></A>this feeling finds a home, even pleasure at the honour men pay them. And 
<A NAME="27"></A>the truth of this I soon will show; for that son of Theseus, born of the 
<A NAME="28"></A>Amazon, Hippolytus, whom holy Pittheus taught, alone of all the dwellers 
<A NAME="29"></A>in this land of Troezen, calls me vilest of the deities. Love he scorns, 
<A NAME="30"></A>and, as for marriage, will none of it; but Artemis, daughter of Zeus, sister 
<A NAME="31"></A>of Phoebus, he doth honour, counting her the chief of goddesses, and ever 
<A NAME="32"></A>through the greenwood, attendant on his virgin goddess, he clears the earth 
<A NAME="33"></A>of wild beasts with his fleet hounds, enjoying the comradeship of one too 
<A NAME="34"></A>high for mortal ken. 'Tis not this I grudge him, no! why should I? But 
<A NAME="35"></A>for his sins against me, I will this very day take vengeance on Hippolytus; 
<A NAME="36"></A>for long ago I cleared the ground of many obstacles, so it needs but trifling 
<A NAME="37"></A>toil. For as he came one day from the home of Pittheus to witness the solemn 
<A NAME="38"></A>mystic rites and be initiated therein in Pandion's land, Phaedra, his father's 
<A NAME="39"></A>noble wife, caught sight of him, and by my designs she found her heart 
<A NAME="40"></A>was seized with wild desire. And ere she came to this Troezenian realm, 
<A NAME="41"></A>a temple did she rear to Cypris hard by the rock of Pallas where it o'erlooks 
<A NAME="42"></A>this country, for love of the youth in another land; and to win his love 
<A NAME="43"></A>in days to come she called after his name the temple she had founded for 
<A NAME="44"></A>the goddess. Now, when Theseus left the land of Cecrops, flying the pollution 
<A NAME="45"></A>of the blood of Pallas' sons, and with his wife sailed to this shore, content 
<A NAME="46"></A>to suffer exile for a year, then began the wretched wife to pine away in 
<A NAME="47"></A>silence, moaning 'neath love's cruel scourge, and none of her servants 
<A NAME="48"></A>knows what disease afflicts her. But this passion of hers must not fail 
<A NAME="49"></A>thus. No, I will discover the matter to Theseus, and all shall be laid 
<A NAME="50"></A>bare. Then will the father slay his child, my bitter foe, by curses, for 
<A NAME="51"></A>the lord Poseidon granted this boon to Theseus; three wishes of the god 
<A NAME="52"></A>to ask, nor ever ask in vain. So Phaedra is to die, an honoured death 'tis 
<A NAME="53"></A>true, but still to die; for I will not let her suffering outweigh the payment 
<A NAME="54"></A>of such forfeit by my foes as shall satisfy my honour. But lo! I see the 
<A NAME="55"></A>son of Theseus coming hither-Hippolytus, fresh from the labours of the 
<A NAME="56"></A>chase. I will get me hence. At his back follows a long train of retainers, 
<A NAME="57"></A>in joyous cries of revelry uniting and hymns of praise to Artemis, his 
<A NAME="58"></A>goddess; for little he recks that Death hath oped his gates for him, and 
<A NAME="59"></A>that this is his last look upon the light. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="77"></A>with the dew from rivers drawn purity that garden tends. Such as know no 
<A NAME="78"></A>cunning lore, yet in whose nature self-control, made perfect, hath a home, 
<A NAME="79"></A>these may pluck the flowers, but not the wicked world. Accept, I pray, 
<A NAME="80"></A>dear mistress, mine this chaplet from my holy hand to crown thy locks of 
<A NAME="81"></A>gold; for I, and none other of mortals, have this high guerdon, to be with

<A NAME="143"></A><I>strophe 1</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="144"></A>A rock there is, where, as they say, the ocean dew distils, and from its 
<A NAME="145"></A>beetling brow it pours a copious stream for pitchers to be dipped therein; 
<A NAME="146"></A>'twas here I had a friend washing robes of purple in the trickling stream, 
<A NAME="147"></A>and she was spreading them out on the face of warm sunny rock; from her 
<A NAME="148"></A>I had the tidings, first of all, that my mistress- <BR><BR><I>antistrophe 
<A NAME="149"></A>1</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="150"></A>Was wasting on the bed of sickness, pent within her house, a thin veil 
<A NAME="151"></A>o'ershadowing her head of golden hair. And this is the third day I hear 
<A NAME="152"></A>that she hath closed her lovely lips and denied her chaste body all sustenance, 
<A NAME="153"></A>eager to hide her suffering and reach death's cheerless bourn. <BR><BR><I>strophe 
<A NAME="154"></A>2</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="155"></A>Maiden, thou must be possessed, by Pan made frantic or by Hecate, or by 
<A NAME="156"></A>the Corybantes dread, and Cybele the mountain mother. Or maybe thou hast 
<A NAME="157"></A>sinned against Dictynna, huntress-queen, and art wasting for thy guilt 
<A NAME="158"></A>in sacrifice unoffered. For she doth range o'er lakes' expanse and past 
<A NAME="159"></A>the bounds of earth upon the ocean's tossing billows. <BR><BR><I>antistrophe 
<A NAME="160"></A>2</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="161"></A>Or doth some rival in thy house beguile thy lord, the captain of Erechtheus' 
<A NAME="162"></A>sons, that hero nobly born, to secret amours hid from thee? Or hath some 
<A NAME="163"></A>mariner sailing hither from Crete reached this port that sailors love, 
<A NAME="164"></A>with evil tidings for our queen, and she with sorrow for her grievous fate 
<A NAME="165"></A>is to her bed confined? <BR><BR><I>epode</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="166"></A>Yea, and oft o'er woman's wayward nature settles a feeling of miserable 
<A NAME="167"></A>helplessness, arising from pains of child-birth or of passionate desire. 
<A NAME="168"></A>I, too, have felt at times this sharp thrill shoot through me, but I would 
<A NAME="169"></A>cry to Artemis, queen of archery, who comes from heaven to aid us in our 
<A NAME="170"></A>travail, and thanks to heaven's grace she ever comes at my call with welcome 
<A NAME="171"></A>help. Look! where the aged nurse is bringing her forth from the house before 
<A NAME="172"></A>the door, while on her brow the cloud of gloom is deepening. My soul longs 
<A NAME="173"></A>to learn what is her grief, the canker that is wasting our queen's fading

<A NAME="181"></A>here the azure sky; lo! we have brought thee on thy bed of sickness without 
<A NAME="182"></A>the palace; for all thy talk was of coming hither, but soon back to thy 
<A NAME="183"></A>chamber wilt thou hurry. Disappointment follows fast with thee, thou hast 
<A NAME="184"></A>no joy in aught for long; the present has no power to please; on something 
<A NAME="185"></A>absent next thy heart is set. Better be sick than tend the sick; the first 
<A NAME="186"></A>is but a single ill, the last unites mental grief with manual toil. Man's 
<A NAME="187"></A>whole life is full of anguish; no respite from his woes he finds; but if 
<A NAME="188"></A>there is aught to love beyond this life, night's dark pall doth wrap it 
<A NAME="189"></A>round. And so we show our mad love of this life because its light is shed

<A NAME="405"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Women of Troezen, who dwell here upon the frontier edge of 
<A NAME="406"></A>Pelops' land, oft ere now in heedless mood through the long hours of night 
<A NAME="407"></A>have I wondered why man's life is spoiled; and it seems to me their evil 
<A NAME="408"></A>case is not due to any natural fault of judgment, for there be many dowered 
<A NAME="409"></A>with sense, but we must view the matter in this light: by teaching and 
<A NAME="410"></A>experience to learn the right but neglect it in practice, some from sloth, 
<A NAME="411"></A>others from preferring pleasure of some kind or other to duty. Now life 
<A NAME="412"></A>has many pleasures, protracted talk, and leisure, that seductive evil; 
<A NAME="413"></A>likewise there is shame which is of two kinds, one a noble quality, the 
<A NAME="414"></A>other a curse to families; but if for each its proper time were clearly 
<A NAME="415"></A>known, these twain could not have had the selfsame letters to denote them. 
<A NAME="416"></A>So then since I had made up my mind on these points, 'twas not likely any 
<A NAME="417"></A>drug would alter it and make me think the contrary. And I will tell the 
<A NAME="418"></A>too the way my judgment went. When love wounded me, I bethought me how 
<A NAME="419"></A>I best might bear the smart. So from that day forth I began to hide in 
<A NAME="420"></A>silence what I suffered. For I put no faith in counsellors, who know well 
<A NAME="421"></A>to lecture others for presumption, yet themselves have countless troubles 
<A NAME="422"></A>of their own. Next I did devise noble endurance of these wanton thoughts, 
<A NAME="423"></A>striving by continence for victory. And last when I could not succeed in 
<A NAME="424"></A>mastering love hereby, methought it best to die; and none can gainsay my 
<A NAME="425"></A>purpose. For fain I would my virtue should to all appear, my shame have 
<A NAME="426"></A>few to witness it. I knew my sickly passion now; to yield to it I saw how 
<A NAME="427"></A>infamous; and more, I learnt to know so well that I was but woman, a thing 
<A NAME="428"></A>the world detests. Curses, hideous curses on that wife who first did shame 
<A NAME="429"></A>her marriage-vow for lovers other than her lord! 'Twas from noble families 
<A NAME="430"></A>this curse began to spread among our sex. For when the noble countenance 
<A NAME="431"></A>disgrace, poor folk of course will think that it is right. Those too I 
<A NAME="432"></A>hate who make profession of purity, though in secret reckless sinners. 
<A NAME="433"></A>How can these, queen Cypris, ocean's child, e'er look their husbands in 
<A NAME="434"></A>the face? do they never feel one guilty thrill that their accomplice, night, 
<A NAME="435"></A>or the chambers of their house will find a voice and speak? This it is 
<A NAME="436"></A>that calls on me to die, kind friends, that so I may ne'er be found to 
<A NAME="437"></A>have disgraced my lord, or the children I have borne; no! may they grow 
<A NAME="438"></A>up and dwell in glorious Athens, free to speak and act, heirs to such fair 
<A NAME="439"></A>fame as a mother can bequeath. For to know that father or mother has sinned 
<A NAME="440"></A>doth turn the stoutest heart to slavishness. This alone, men say, can stand 
<A NAME="441"></A>the buffets of life's battle, a just and virtuous soul in whomsoever found. 
<A NAME="442"></A>For time unmasks the villain soon or late, holding up to them a mirror

<A NAME="450"></A>second thoughts are often best even with men. Thy fate is no uncommon nor

<A NAME="452"></A>Thou art in love; what wonder? so are many more. Wilt thou, because thou 
<A NAME="453"></A>lov'st, destroy thyself? 'Tis little gain, I trow, for those who love or 
<A NAME="454"></A>yet may love their fellows, if death must be their end; for though the 
<A NAME="455"></A>Love-Queen's onset in her might is more than man can bear, yet doth she 
<A NAME="456"></A>gently visit yielding hearts, and only when she finds a proud unnatural 
<A NAME="457"></A>spirit, doth she take and mock it past belief. Her path is in the sky, 
<A NAME="458"></A>and mid the ocean's surge she rides; from her all nature springs; she sows 
<A NAME="459"></A>the seeds of love, inspires the warm desire to which we sons of earth all 
<A NAME="460"></A>owe our being. They who have aught to do with books of ancient scribes, 
<A NAME="461"></A>or themselves engage in studious pursuits, know how Zeus of Semele was 
<A NAME="462"></A>enamoured, how the bright-eyed goddess of the Dawn once stole Cephalus 
<A NAME="463"></A>to dwell in heaven for the love she bore him; yet these in heaven abide 
<A NAME="464"></A>nor shun the gods' approach, content, I trow, to yield to their misfortune. 
<A NAME="465"></A>Wilt thou refuse to yield? thy sire, it seems, should have begotten thee 
<A NAME="466"></A>on special terms or with different gods for masters, if in these laws thou 
<A NAME="467"></A>wilt not acquiesce. How many, prithee, men of sterling sense, when they 
<A NAME="468"></A>see their wives unfaithful, make as though they saw it not? How many fathers, 
<A NAME="469"></A>when their sons have gone astray, assist them in their amours? 'Tis part 
<A NAME="470"></A>of human wisdom to conceal the deed of shame. Nor should man aim at too 
<A NAME="471"></A>great refinement in his life; for they cannot with exactness finish e'en 
<A NAME="472"></A>the roof that covers in a house; and how dost thou, after falling into 
<A NAME="473"></A>so deep a pit, think to escape? Nay, if thou hast more of good than bad, 
<A NAME="474"></A>thou wilt fare exceeding well, thy human nature considered. O cease, my

<A NAME="637"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Great Zeus, why didst thou, to man's sorrow, put woman, evil 
<A NAME="638"></A>counterfeit, to dwell where shines the sun? If thou wert minded that the 
<A NAME="639"></A>human race should multiply, it was not from women they should have drawn 
<A NAME="640"></A>their stock, but in thy temples they should have paid gold or iron or ponderous 
<A NAME="641"></A>bronze and bought a family, each man proportioned to his offering, and 
<A NAME="642"></A>so in independence dwelt, from women free. But now as soon as ever we would 
<A NAME="643"></A>bring this plague into our home we bring its fortune to the ground. 'Tis 
<A NAME="644"></A>clear from this how great a curse a woman is; the very father, that begot 
<A NAME="645"></A>and nurtured her, to rid him of the mischief, gives her a dower and packs 
<A NAME="646"></A>her off; while the husband, who takes the noxious weed into his home, fondly 
<A NAME="647"></A>decks his sorry idol in fine raiment and tricks her out in robes, squandering 
<A NAME="648"></A>by degrees, unhappy wight! his house's wealth. For he is in this dilemma; 
<A NAME="649"></A>say his marriage has brought him good connections, he is glad then to keep 
<A NAME="650"></A>the wife he loathes; or, if he gets a good wife but useless kin, he tries 
<A NAME="651"></A>to stifle the bad luck with the good. But it is easiest for him who has 
<A NAME="652"></A>settled in his house as wife mere cipher, incapable from simplicity. I 
<A NAME="653"></A>hate a clever woman; never may she set foot in my house who aims at knowing 
<A NAME="654"></A>more than women need; for in these clever women Cypris implants a larger 
<A NAME="655"></A>store of villainy, while the artless woman is by her shallow wit from levity 
<A NAME="656"></A>debarred. No servant should ever have had access to a wife, but men should 
<A NAME="657"></A>put to live with them beasts, which bite, not talk, in which case they 
<A NAME="658"></A>could not speak to any one nor be answered back by them. But, as it is, 
<A NAME="659"></A>the wicked in their chambers plot wickedness, and their servants carry 
<A NAME="660"></A>it abroad. Even thus, vile wretch, thou cam'st to make me partner in an 
<A NAME="661"></A>outrage on my father's honour; wherefore I must wash that stain away in 
<A NAME="662"></A>running streams, dashing the water into my ears. How could I commit so 
<A NAME="663"></A>foul a crime when by the very mention of it I feel myself polluted? Be 
<A NAME="664"></A>well assured, woman, 'tis only my religious scruple saves thee. For had 
<A NAME="665"></A>not I unawares been caught by an oath, 'fore heaven! I would not have refrained 
<A NAME="666"></A>from telling all unto my father. But now I will from the house away, so 
<A NAME="667"></A>long as Theseus is abroad, and will maintain strict silence. But, when 
<A NAME="668"></A>my father comes, I will return and see how thou and thy mistress face him, 
<A NAME="669"></A>and so shall I learn by experience the extent of thy audacity. Perdition 
<A NAME="670"></A>seize you both! I can never satisfy my hate for women, no! not even though 
<A NAME="671"></A>some say this is ever my theme, for of a truth they always are evil. So 
<A NAME="672"></A>either let some one prove them chaste, or let me still trample on them 
<A NAME="673"></A>for ever. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="949"></A>Thou wilt assert she hated thee, that 'twixt the bastard and the true-born

<A NAME="967"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Father, thy wrath and the tension of thy mind are terrible; 
<A NAME="968"></A>yet this charge, specious though its arguments appear, becomes a calumny, 
<A NAME="969"></A>if one lay it bare. Small skill have I in speaking to a crowd, but have 
<A NAME="970"></A>a readier wit for comrades of mine own age and small companies. Yea, and 
<A NAME="971"></A>this is as it should be; for they, whom the wise despise, are better qualified 
<A NAME="972"></A>to speak before a mob. Yet am I constrained under the present circumstances 
<A NAME="973"></A>to break silence. And at the outset will I take the point which formed 
<A NAME="974"></A>the basis of thy stealthy attack on me, designed to put me out of court 
<A NAME="975"></A>unheard; dost see yon sun, this earth? These do not contain, for all thou 
<A NAME="976"></A>dost deny it, chastity surpassing mine. To reverence God I count the highest 
<A NAME="977"></A>knowledge, and to adopt as friends not those who attempt injustice, but 
<A NAME="978"></A>such as would blush to propose to their companions aught disgraceful or 
<A NAME="979"></A>pleasure them by shameful services; to mock at friends is not my way, father, 
<A NAME="980"></A>but I am still the same behind their backs as to their face. The very crime 
<A NAME="981"></A>thou thinkest to catch me in, is just the one I am untainted with, for 
<A NAME="982"></A>to this day have I kept me pure from women. Nor know I aught thereof, save 
<A NAME="983"></A>what I hear or see in pictures, for I have no wish to look even on these, 
<A NAME="984"></A>so pure my virgin soul. I grant my claim to chastity may not convince thee; 
<A NAME="985"></A>well, 'tis then for thee to show the way I was corrupted. Did this woman 
<A NAME="986"></A>exceed in beauty all her sex? Did aspire to fill the husband's place after 
<A NAME="987"></A>thee and succeed to thy house? That surely would have made me out a fool, 
<A NAME="988"></A>a creature void of sense. Thou wilt say, "Your chaste man loves to lord 
<A NAME="989"></A>it." No, no! say I, sovereignty pleases only those whose hearts are quite 
<A NAME="990"></A>corrupt. Now, I would be the first and best at all the games in Hellas, 
<A NAME="991"></A>but second in the state, for ever happy thus with the noblest for my friends. 
<A NAME="992"></A>For there one may be happy, and the absence of danger gives a charm beyond 
<A NAME="993"></A>all princely joys. One thing I have not said, the rest thou hast. Had I 
<A NAME="994"></A>a witness to attest my purity, and were I pitted 'gainst her still alive, 
<A NAME="995"></A>facts would show thee on enquiry who the culprit was. Now by Zeus, the 
<A NAME="996"></A>god of oaths, and by the earth, whereon we stand, I swear to thee I never 
<A NAME="997"></A>did lay hand upon thy wife nor would have wished to, or have harboured 
<A NAME="998"></A>such a thought. Slay me, ye gods! rob me of name and honour, from home 
<A NAME="999"></A>and city cast me forth, a wandering exile o'er the earth! nor sea nor land 
<A NAME="1000"></A>receive my bones when I am dead, if I am such a miscreant! I cannot say 
<A NAME="1001"></A>if she through fear destroyed herself, for more than this am I forbid.

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="1147"></A><B>MESSENGER</B>
<A NAME="1148"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Hard by the wave-beat shore were we combing out his horses' 
<A NAME="1149"></A>manes, weeping the while, for one had come to say that Hippolytus was harshly 
<A NAME="1150"></A>exiled by thee and nevermore would return to set foot in this land. Then 
<A NAME="1151"></A>came he, telling the same doleful tale to us upon the beach, and with him 
<A NAME="1152"></A>was a countless throng of friends who followed after. At length he stayed 
<A NAME="1153"></A>his lamentation and spake: "Why weakly rave on this wise? My father's commands 
<A NAME="1154"></A>must be obeyed. Ho! servants, harness my horses to the chariot; this is 
<A NAME="1155"></A>no longer now city of mine." Thereupon each one of us bestirred himself, 
<A NAME="1156"></A>and, ere a man could say 'twas done, we had the horses standing ready at 
<A NAME="1157"></A>our master's side. Then he caught up the reins from the chariot-rail, first 
<A NAME="1158"></A>fitting his feet exactly in the hollows made for them. But first with outspread 
<A NAME="1159"></A>palms he called upon the gods, "O Zeus, now strike me dead, if I have sinned, 
<A NAME="1160"></A>and let my father learn how he is wronging me, in death at least, if not 
<A NAME="1161"></A>in life." Therewith he seized the whip and lashed each horse in turn; while 
<A NAME="1162"></A>we, close by his chariot, near the reins, kept up with him along the road 
<A NAME="1163"></A>that leads direct to Argos and Epidaurus. And just as we were coming to 
<A NAME="1164"></A>a desert spot, a strip of sand beyond the borders of this country, sloping 
<A NAME="1165"></A>right to the Saronic gulf, there issued thence a deep rumbling sound, as 
<A NAME="1166"></A>it were an earthquake, fearsome noise, and the horses reared their heads 
<A NAME="1167"></A>and pricked their ears, while we were filled with wild alarm to know whence 
<A NAME="1168"></A>came the sound; when, as we gazed toward the wave-beat shore, a wave tremendous 
<A NAME="1169"></A>we beheld towering to the skies, so that from our view the cliffs of Sciron 
<A NAME="1170"></A>vanished, for it hid the isthmus and the rock of Asclepius; then swelling 
<A NAME="1171"></A>and frothing with a crest of foam, the sea discharged it toward the beach 
<A NAME="1172"></A>where stood the harnessed car, and in the moment that it broke, that mighty 
<A NAME="1173"></A>wall of waters, there issued from the wave a monstrous bull, whose bellowing 
<A NAME="1174"></A>filled the land with fearsome echoes, a sight too awful as it seemed to 
<A NAME="1175"></A>us who witnessed it. A panic seized the horses there and then, but our 
<A NAME="1176"></A>master, to horses' ways quite used, gripped in both hands his reins, and 
<A NAME="1177"></A>tying them to his body pulled them backward as the sailor pulls his oar; 
<A NAME="1178"></A>but the horses gnashed the forged bits between their teeth and bore him 
<A NAME="1179"></A>wildly on, regardless of their master's guiding hand or rein or jointed 
<A NAME="1180"></A>car. And oft as he would take the guiding rein and steer for softer ground, 
<A NAME="1181"></A>showed that bull in front to turn him back again, maddening his team with 
<A NAME="1182"></A>terror; but if in their frantic career they ran towards the rocks, he would 
<A NAME="1183"></A>draw nigh the chariot-rail, keeping up with them, until, suddenly dashing 
<A NAME="1184"></A>the wheel against a stone, he upset and wrecked the car; then was dire 
<A NAME="1185"></A>confusion, axle-boxes and linchpins springing into the air. While he, poor 
<A NAME="1186"></A>youth, entangled in the reins was dragged along, bound by a stubborn knot, 
<A NAME="1187"></A>his poor head dashed against the rocks, his flesh all torn, the while he 
<A NAME="1188"></A>cried out piteously, "Stay, stay, my horses whom my own hand hath fed at 
<A NAME="1189"></A>the manger, destroy me not utterly. O luckless curse of a father! Will 
<A NAME="1190"></A>no one come and save me for all my virtue?" Now we, though much we longed 
<A NAME="1191"></A>to help, were left far behind. At last, I know not how, he broke loose 
<A NAME="1192"></A>from the shapely reins that bound him, a faint breath of life still in 
<A NAME="1193"></A>him; but the horses disappeared, and that portentous bull, among the rocky 
<A NAME="1194"></A>ground, I know not where. I am but a slave in thy house, 'tis true, O king, 
<A NAME="1195"></A>yet will I never believe so monstrous a charge against thy son's character, 
<A NAME="1196"></A>no! not though the whole race of womankind should hang itself, or one should
