<BR><BR>Before the temple of Demeter at Eleusis. On the steps of the great altar is seated AETHRA. Around her, in the garb of suppliants, is the CHORUS OF ARGIVE MOTHERS.

<A NAME="22"></A><B>AETHRA</B>
<A NAME="23"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>O Demeter, guardian of this Eleusinian land, and ye servants 
<A NAME="24"></A>of the goddess who attend her fane, grant happiness to me and my son Theseus, 
<A NAME="25"></A>to the city of Athens and the country of Pittheus, wherein my father reared 
<A NAME="26"></A>me, Aethra, in a happy home, and gave me in marriage to Aegeus, Pandion's 
<A NAME="27"></A>son, according to the oracle of Loxias. This prayer I make, when I behold 
<A NAME="28"></A>these aged dames, who, leaving their homes in Argos, now throw themselves 
<A NAME="29"></A>with suppliant branches at my knees in their awful trouble; for around 
<A NAME="30"></A>the gates of Cadmus have they lost their seven noble sons, whom on a day 
<A NAME="31"></A>Adrastus, king of Argos, led thither, eager to secure for exiled Polyneices, 
<A NAME="32"></A>his son-in-law, a share in the heritage of Oedipus; so now their mothers 
<A NAME="33"></A>would bury in the grave the dead, whom the spear hath slain, but the victors 
<A NAME="34"></A>prevent them and will not allow them to take up the corpses, spurning Heaven's 
<A NAME="35"></A>laws. Here lies Adrastus on the ground with streaming eye, sharing with 
<A NAME="36"></A>them the burden of their prayer to me, and bemoaning the havoc of the sword 
<A NAME="37"></A>and the sorry fate of the warriors whom he led from their homes. And he 
<A NAME="38"></A>doth urge me use entreaty, to persuade my son to take up the dead and help 
<A NAME="39"></A>to bury them, either by winning words or force of arms, laying on my son 
<A NAME="40"></A>and on Athens this task alone. Now it chanced, that I had left my house 
<A NAME="41"></A>and come to offer sacrifice on behalf of the earth's crop at this shrine, 
<A NAME="42"></A>where first the fruitful corn showed its bristling shocks above the soil. 
<A NAME="43"></A>And here at the holy altars of the twain goddesses, Demeter and her daughter, 
<A NAME="44"></A>I wait, holding these sprays of foliage, a bond that bindeth not, in compassion 
<A NAME="45"></A>for these childless mothers, hoary with age, and from reverence for the 
<A NAME="46"></A>sacred fillets. To call Theseus hither is my herald to the city gone, that 
<A NAME="47"></A>he may rid the land of that which grieveth them, or loose these my suppliant 
<A NAME="48"></A>bonds, with pious observance of the gods' will; for such as are discreet 
<A NAME="49"></A>amongst women should in all cases invoke the aid of men.

<A NAME="52"></A><I>strophe 1</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="53"></A>At thy knees I fall, aged dame, and my old lips beseech thee; arise, rescue 
<A NAME="54"></A>from the slain my children's bodies, whose limbs, by death relaxed, are 
<A NAME="55"></A>left a prey to savage mountain beasts, <BR><BR><I>antistrophe 
<A NAME="56"></A>1</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="57"></A>Beholding the bitter tears which spring to my eyes and my old wrinkled 
<A NAME="58"></A>skin torn by my hands; for what can I do else? who never laid out my children 
<A NAME="59"></A>dead within my halls, nor now behold their tombs heaped up with earth. 
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR><I>strophe 2</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="61"></A>Thou too, honoured lady, once a son didst bear, crowning thy lord's marriage 
<A NAME="62"></A>with fond joy; then share, O share with me thy mother's feelings, in such 
<A NAME="63"></A>measure as my sad heart grieves for my own dead sons; and persuade thy 
<A NAME="64"></A>son, whose aid we implore, to go unto the river Ismenus, there to place 
<A NAME="65"></A>within my hapless arms the bodies of my children, slain in their prime 
<A NAME="66"></A>and left without a tomb. <BR><BR><I>antistrophe 2</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="67"></A>Though not as piety enjoins, yet from sheer necessity I have come to the 
<A NAME="68"></A>fire-crowned altars of the gods, falling on my knees with instant supplication, 
<A NAME="69"></A>for my cause is just, and 'tis in thy power, blest as thou art in thy children, 
<A NAME="70"></A>to remove from me my woe; so in my sore distress I do beseech thee of my 
<A NAME="71"></A>misery place in my hands my son's dead body, that I may throw my arms about 
<A NAME="72"></A>his hapless limbs. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="73"></A><I>The attendants of the goddess take up the lament.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR><I>strophe 3</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="75"></A>Behold a rivalry in sorrow! woe takes up the tale of woe; hark! thy servants 
<A NAME="76"></A>beat their breasts. Come ye who join the mourners' wail, come, O sympathetic 
<A NAME="77"></A>band, to join the dance, which Hades honours; let the pearly nail be stained 
<A NAME="78"></A>red, as it rends your cheeks, let your skin be streaked with gore; for 
<A NAME="79"></A>honours rendered to the dead are credit to the living. <BR><BR><I>antistrophe 
<A NAME="80"></A>3</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="81"></A>Sorrow's charm doth drive me wild, insatiate, painful, endless, even as 
<A NAME="82"></A>the trickling stream that gushes from some steep rock's face; for 'tis 
<A NAME="83"></A>woman's way to fall a-weeping o'er the cruel calamity of children dead. 
<A NAME="84"></A>Ah me! would I could die and forget my anguish </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="86"></A><B>THESEUS</B>
<A NAME="87"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What is this lamentation that I hear, this beating of the breast, 
<A NAME="88"></A>these dirges for the dead, with cries that echo from this shrine? How fluttering 
<A NAME="89"></A>fear disquiets me, lest haply my mother have gotted some mischance, in 
<A NAME="90"></A>quest of whom I come, for she hath been long absent from home. Ha! what 
<A NAME="91"></A>now? A strange sight challenges my speech; I see my aged mother sitting 
<A NAME="92"></A>at the altar and stranger dames are with her, who in various note proclaim 
<A NAME="93"></A>their woe; from aged eyes the piteous tear is starting to the ground, their 
<A NAME="94"></A>hair is shorn, their robes are not the robes of joy. What means it, mother? 
<A NAME="95"></A>'Tis thine to make it plain to me, mine to listen; yea, for I expect some 
<A NAME="96"></A>tidings strange. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="97"></A><B>AETHRA</B>
<A NAME="98"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>My son, these are the mothers of those chieftains seven, who 
<A NAME="99"></A>fell around the gates of Cadmus' town. With suppliant boughs they keep 
<A NAME="100"></A>me prisoner, as thou seest, in their midst. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="114"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>To thee, in thy mantle muffled, I address my inquiries; thy

<A NAME="220"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Thou didst favour courage instead of discretion. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="221"></A><B>ADRASTUS</B>
<A NAME="222"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>True; and many a general owes defeat to that. O king of Athens, 
<A NAME="223"></A>bravest of the sons of Hellas, I blush to throw myself upon the ground 
<A NAME="224"></A>and clasp thy knees, I a grey-haired king, blest in days gone by; yet needs 
<A NAME="225"></A>must yield to my misfortunes. I pray thee save the dead; have pity on my 
<A NAME="226"></A>sorrows and on these, the mothers of the slain, whom hoary eld finds reft 
<A NAME="227"></A>of their sons; yet they endured to journey hither and tread a foreign soil 
<A NAME="228"></A>with aged tottering steps, bearing no embassy to Demeter's mysteries; only 
<A NAME="229"></A>seeking burial for their dead, which lot should have been theirs, e'en 
<A NAME="230"></A>burial by the hands of sons still in their prime. And 'tis wise in the 
<A NAME="231"></A>rich to see the poor man's poverty, and in the poor man to turn ambitious 
<A NAME="232"></A>eyes toward the rich, that so he may himself indulge a longing for possessions; 
<A NAME="233"></A>and they, whom fortune frowns not on, should gaze on misery's presentment; 
<A NAME="234"></A>likewise, who maketh songs should take a pleasure in their making; for 
<A NAME="235"></A>if it be not so with him, he will in no wise avail to gladden others, if 
<A NAME="236"></A>himself have sorrow in his home; nay, 'tis not even right to expect it. 
<A NAME="237"></A>Mayhap thou'lt say, "Why pass the land of Pelops o'er, and lay this toil 
<A NAME="238"></A>on Athens?" This am I bound to declare. Sparta is cruel, her customs variable; 
<A NAME="239"></A>the other states are small and weak. Thy city alone would be able to undertake 
<A NAME="240"></A>this labour; for it turns an eye on suffering, and hath in thee a young 
<A NAME="241"></A>and gallant king, for want whereof to lead their hosts states ere now have

<A NAME="249"></A>I hold contrary view, that good o'er bad predominates in man, for if it 
<A NAME="250"></A>were not so, we should not exist. He hath my praise, whoe'er of gods brought 
<A NAME="251"></A>us to live by rule from chaos and from brutishness, first by implanting 
<A NAME="252"></A>reason, and next by giving us a tongue to declare our thoughts, so as to 
<A NAME="253"></A>know the meaning of what is said, bestowing fruitful crops, and drops of 
<A NAME="254"></A>rain from heaven to make them grow, wherewith to nourish earth's fruits 
<A NAME="255"></A>and to water her lap; and more than this, protection from the wintry storm, 
<A NAME="256"></A>and means to ward from us the sun-god's scorching heat; the art of sailing 
<A NAME="257"></A>o'er the sea, so that we might exchange with one another whatso our countries 
<A NAME="258"></A>lack. And where sight fails us and our knowledge is not sure, the seer 
<A NAME="259"></A>foretells by gazing on the flame, by reading signs in folds of entrails, 
<A NAME="260"></A>or by divination from the flight of birds. Are we not then to proud, when 
<A NAME="261"></A>heaven hath made such preparation for our life, not to be content therewith? 
<A NAME="262"></A>But our presumption seeks to lord it over heaven, and in the pride of our 
<A NAME="263"></A>hearts we think we are wiser than the gods. Methinks thou art even of this

<A NAME="267"></A>no! never should the wise man have joined the stock of just and unjust 
<A NAME="268"></A>in one, but should have gotten prosperous friends for his family. For the 
<A NAME="269"></A>deity, confusing their destinies, doth oft destroy by the sinner's fate 
<A NAME="270"></A>him who never sinned nor committed injustice. Thou didst lead all Argos 
<A NAME="271"></A>forth to battle, though seers proclaimed the will of heaven, and then in 
<A NAME="272"></A>scorn of them and in violent disregard of the gods hast ruined thy city, 
<A NAME="273"></A>led away by younger men, such as court distinction, and add war to war 
<A NAME="274"></A>unrighteously, destroying their fellow-citizens; one aspires to lead an

<A NAME="276"></A>a third is bent on gain, careless of any ill the people thereby suffer.

<A NAME="279"></A>more than is right, and shoot out grievous stings against the men who have 
<A NAME="280"></A>aught, beguiled as they are by the eloquence of vicious leaders; while 
<A NAME="281"></A>the class that is midmost of the three preserveth cities, observing such

<A NAME="449"></A>than a despot; where he is, there are first no laws common to all, but 
<A NAME="450"></A>one man is tyrant, in whose keeping and in his alone the law resides, and 
<A NAME="451"></A>in that case equality is at an end. But when the laws are written down, 
<A NAME="452"></A>rich and poor alike have equal justice, and it is open to the weaker to 
<A NAME="453"></A>use the same language to the prosperous when he is reviled by him, and 
<A NAME="454"></A>the weaker prevails over the stronger if he have justice on his side. Freedom's 
<A NAME="455"></A>mark is also seen in this: "Who hath wholesome counsel to declare unto 
<A NAME="456"></A>the state?" And he who chooses to do so gains renown, while he, who hath 
<A NAME="457"></A>no wish, remains silent. What greater equality can there be in a city? 
<A NAME="458"></A>Again, where the people are absolute rulers of the land, they rejoice in 
<A NAME="459"></A>having reserve of youthful citizens, while a king counts this a hostile 
<A NAME="460"></A>element, and strives to slay the leading men, all such as he deems discreet, 
<A NAME="461"></A>for he feareth for his power. How then can a city remain stable, where 
<A NAME="462"></A>one cuts short all enterprise and mows down the young like meadow-flowers 
<A NAME="463"></A>in spring-time? What boots it to acquire wealth and livelihood for children, 
<A NAME="464"></A>merely to add to the tyrant's substance by one's toil? Why train up virgin

<A NAME="497"></A>Now thou art helping our foes even after death, trying to rescue and bury

<A NAME="525"></A>the law of all Hellas. What is not well in this? If ye suffered aught from 
<A NAME="526"></A>the Argives-lo! they are dead; ye took a splendid vengeance on your foes 
<A NAME="527"></A>and covered them with shame, and now your right is at an end. Let the dead 
<A NAME="528"></A>now be buried in the earth, and each element return to the place from whence 
<A NAME="529"></A>it came to the body, the breath to the air, the body to the ground; for 
<A NAME="530"></A>in no wise did we get it for our own, but to live our life in, and after 
<A NAME="531"></A>that its mother earth must take it back again. Dost think 'tis Argos thou 
<A NAME="532"></A>art injuring in refusing burial to the dead? Nay! all Hellas shares herein, 
<A NAME="533"></A>if a man rob the dead of their due and keep them from the tomb; for, if 
<A NAME="534"></A>this law be enacted, it will strike dismay into the stoutest hearts. And 
<A NAME="535"></A>art thou come to cast dire threats at me while thy own folk are afraid 
<A NAME="536"></A>of giving burial to the dead? What is your fear? Think you they will undermine 
<A NAME="537"></A>your land in their graves, or that they will beget children in the womb 
<A NAME="538"></A>of earth, from whom shall rise an avenger? A silly waste of words, in truth 
<A NAME="539"></A>it was, to show your fear of paltry groundless terrors. Go, triflers, learn 
<A NAME="540"></A>the lesson of human misery; our life is made up of struggles; some men 
<A NAME="541"></A>there be that find their fortune soon, others have to wait, while some 
<A NAME="542"></A>at once are blest. Fortune lives a dainty life; to her the wretched pays 
<A NAME="543"></A>his court and homage to win her smile; her likewise doth the prosperous 
<A NAME="544"></A>man extol, for fear the favouring gale may leave him. These lessons should 
<A NAME="545"></A>we take to heart, to bear with moderation, free from wrath, our wrongs, 
<A NAME="546"></A>and do naught to hurt a whole city. What then? Let us, who will the pious 
<A NAME="547"></A>deed perform, bury the corpses of the slain. Else is the issue clear; I 
<A NAME="548"></A>will go and bury them by force. For never shall it be proclaimed through 
<A NAME="549"></A>Hellas that heaven's ancient law was set at naught, when it devolved on 
<A NAME="550"></A>me and the city of Pandion. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="673"></A><B>MESSENGER</B>
<A NAME="674"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Bright shone the sun, one levelled line of light, upon the 
<A NAME="675"></A>world, as by Electra's gate I stood to watch, from a turret with a far 
<A NAME="676"></A>outlook. And lo! I saw the host in three divisions, deploying its mail-clad 
<A NAME="677"></A>warriors on the high ground by the banks of Ismenus; this last I heard; 
<A NAME="678"></A>and with them was the king himself, famous son of Aegeus; his own men, 
<A NAME="679"></A>natives of old Cecropia, were ranged upon the right; while on the left, 
<A NAME="680"></A>hard by the fountain of Ares, were the dwellers by the sea, harnessed spearmen 
<A NAME="681"></A>they; on either wing were posted cavalry, in equal numbers, and chariots 
<A NAME="682"></A>were stationed in the shelter of Amphion's holy tomb. Meantime, the folk 
<A NAME="683"></A>of Cadmus set themselves before the walls, placing in the rear the bodies 
<A NAME="684"></A>for which they fought. Horse to horse, and car to car stood ranged. Then 
<A NAME="685"></A>did the herald of Theseus cry aloud to all: "Be still, ye folk! hush, ye 
<A NAME="686"></A>ranks of Cadmus, hearken! we are come to fetch the bodies of the slain, 
<A NAME="687"></A>wishing to bury them in observance of the universal law of Hellas; no wish 
<A NAME="688"></A>have we to lengthen out the slaughter." Not a word would Creon let his 
<A NAME="689"></A>herald answer back, but there he stood in silence under arms. Then did 
<A NAME="690"></A>the drivers of the four-horse cars begin the fray; on, past each other 
<A NAME="691"></A>they drave their chariots, bringing the warriors at their sides up into 
<A NAME="692"></A>line. Some fought with swords, some wheeled the horses back to the fray 
<A NAME="693"></A>again for those they drove. Now when Phorbas, who captained the cavalry 
<A NAME="694"></A>of the Erechtheidae, saw the thronging chariots, he and they who had the 
<A NAME="695"></A>charge of the Theban horse met hand to hand, and by turns were victors 
<A NAME="696"></A>and vanquished. The many horrors happening there I saw, not merely heard 
<A NAME="697"></A>about, for I was at the spot where the chariots and their riders met and 
<A NAME="698"></A>fought, but which to tell of first I know not,-the clouds of dust that 
<A NAME="699"></A>mounted to the sky, the warriors tangled in the reins and dragged this 
<A NAME="700"></A>way and that, the streams of crimson gore, when men fell dead, or when, 
<A NAME="701"></A>from shattered chariot-seats, they tumbled headlong to the ground, and, 
<A NAME="702"></A>amid the splinters of their cars, gave up the ghost. But Creon, when he 
<A NAME="703"></A>marked our cavalry's success on one wing, caught up a shield and rushed 
<A NAME="704"></A>into the fray, ere that despondency should seize his men; but not for that 
<A NAME="705"></A>did Theseus recoil in fear; no! snatching up at once his glittering harnes 
<A NAME="706"></A>he hied him on. And the twain, clashing their shields together as they 
<A NAME="707"></A>met in the midst of the assembled host, were dealing death and courting 
<A NAME="708"></A>it, shouting loudly each to his fellow the battle-cry: "Slay, and with 
<A NAME="709"></A>thy spear strike home against the sons of Erechtheus." Fierce foes to cope 
<A NAME="710"></A>with were the warriors whom the dragon's teeth to manhood reared; so fierce, 
<A NAME="711"></A>they broke our left wing, albeit theirs was routed by our right and put 
<A NAME="712"></A>to flight, so that the struggle was evenly balanced. Here again our chief 
<A NAME="713"></A>deserved all praise, for this success was not the only one he gained; no! 
<A NAME="714"></A>next he sought that part of his army which was wavering; and loud he called 
<A NAME="715"></A>to them, that the earth rang again, "My sons, if ye cannot restrain the 
<A NAME="716"></A>earth-born warriors' stubborn spear, the cause of Pallas is lost." His 
<A NAME="717"></A>word inspired new courage in all the Danaid host. Therewith himself did 
<A NAME="718"></A>seize a fearsome mace, weapon of Epidaurian warfare, and swung it to and 
<A NAME="719"></A>fro, and with that club, as with a sickle, he shore off necks and heads 
<A NAME="720"></A>and helmets thereupon. Scarce even then they turned themselves to fly. 
<A NAME="721"></A>I cried aloud for joy, and danced and clapped my hands; while to the gates 
<A NAME="722"></A>they ran. Throughout the town echoed the shrieks of young and old, as they 
<A NAME="723"></A>crowded the temples in terror. But Theseus, when he might have come inside 
<A NAME="724"></A>the walls, held back his men, for he had not come, said he, to sack the 
<A NAME="725"></A>town, but to ask for the bodies of the dead. Such the general men should 
<A NAME="726"></A>choose, one who shows his bravery in danger, yet hates the pride of those 
<A NAME="727"></A>that in their hour of fortune lose the bliss they might have enjoyed, through 
<A NAME="728"></A>seeking to scale the ladder's topmost step. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="736"></A>when Eteocles was for making terms, in spite of his fair offer we would 
<A NAME="737"></A>not accept them, and so we perished. Then in their turn those foolish folk 
<A NAME="738"></A>of Cadmus, to fortune raised, like some beggar with his newly-gotten wealth, 
<A NAME="739"></A>waxed wanton, and, waxing so, were ruined in their turn. Ye foolish sons

<A NAME="741"></A>by suffering many evils as ye deserve, though deaf to friends, yet yield

<A NAME="864"></A>of thy fuller wisdom, for thou art skilled to know. Myself beheld their 
<A NAME="865"></A>daring deeds, too high for words to tell, whereby they thought to capture 
<A NAME="866"></A>Thebes. One question will I spare thee, lest I provoke thy laughter; the 
<A NAME="867"></A>foe that each of them encountered in the fray, the spear from which each 
<A NAME="868"></A>received his death-wound. These be idle tales alike for those who hear 
<A NAME="869"></A>or him who speaks, that any man amid the fray, when clouds of darts are 
<A NAME="870"></A>hurtling before his eyes, should declare for certain who each champion 
<A NAME="871"></A>is. I could not ask such questions, nor yet believe those who dare assert 
<A NAME="872"></A>the like; for when a man is face to face with the foe, he scarce can see 
<A NAME="873"></A>even that which 'tis his bounden duty to observe. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="874"></A><B>ADRASTUS</B>
<A NAME="875"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Hearken then. For in giving this task to me thou findest a 
<A NAME="876"></A>willing eulogist of friends, whose praise I would declare in all truth 
<A NAME="877"></A>and sincerity. Dost see yon corpse by Zeus's bolt transfixed? That is Capaneus; 
<A NAME="878"></A>though he had ample wealth, yet was he the last to boast of his prosperity; 
<A NAME="879"></A>nor would he ever vaunt himself above a poorer neighbour, but shunned the 
<A NAME="880"></A>man whose sumptuous board had puffed him up too high and made him scorn 
<A NAME="881"></A>mere competence, for he held that virtue lies not in greedy gluttony, but 
<A NAME="882"></A>that moderate means suffice. True friend was he, alike to present or to 
<A NAME="883"></A>absent friends the same; of such the number is not great. His was guileless 
<A NAME="884"></A>character, a courteous address, that left no promise unperformed either 
<A NAME="885"></A>towards his own household or his fellow-citizens. The next I name is Eteoclus; 
<A NAME="886"></A>a master he of other kinds of excellence; young, nor richly dowered with 
<A NAME="887"></A>store, yet high in honour in the Argive land. And though his friends oft 
<A NAME="888"></A>offered gifts of gold, he would not have it in his house, to make his character 
<A NAME="889"></A>its slave by taking wealth's yoke upon him. Not his city, but those that 
<A NAME="890"></A>sinned against her did he hate, for a city is no wise to be blamed if it 
<A NAME="891"></A>get an evil name by reason of an evil governor. Such another was Hippomedon, 
<A NAME="892"></A>third of all this band; from his very boyhood he refrained from turning 
<A NAME="893"></A>towards the allurements of the Muses, to lead life of ease; his home was 
<A NAME="894"></A>in the fields, and gladly would he school his nature to hardships with 
<A NAME="895"></A>a view to manliness, aye hasting to the chase, rejoicing in his steeds 
<A NAME="896"></A>or straining of his bow, because he would make himself of use unto his 
<A NAME="897"></A>state. Next behold the huntress Atalanta's son, Parthenopaeus, a youth 
<A NAME="898"></A>of peerless beauty; from Arcady he came even to the streams of Inachus, 
<A NAME="899"></A>and in Argos spent his boyhood. There, when he grew to man's estate, first, 
<A NAME="900"></A>as is the duty of strangers settled in another land, he showed no pique 
<A NAME="901"></A>or jealousy against the state, became no quibbler, chiefest source of annoyance 
<A NAME="902"></A>citizen or stranger can give, but took his stand amid the host, and fought 
<A NAME="903"></A>for Argos as he were her own son, glad at heart whenso the city prospered, 
<A NAME="904"></A>deeply grieved if e'er reverses came; many a lover though he had midst 
<A NAME="905"></A>men and maids, yet was he careful to avoid offence. Of Tydeus next the 
<A NAME="906"></A>lofty praise I will express in brief; no brilliant spokesman he, but a 
<A NAME="907"></A>clever craftsman in the art of war, with many a shrewd device; inferior 
<A NAME="908"></A>in judgment to his brother Meleager, yet through his warrior skill lending 
<A NAME="909"></A>his name to equal praise, for he had found in arms a perfect science; his 
<A NAME="910"></A>was an ambitious nature, a spirit rich in store of deeds, with words less 
<A NAME="911"></A>fully dowered. From this account then wonder not, Theseus, that they dared 
<A NAME="912"></A>to die before the towers; for noble nurture carries honour with it, and 
<A NAME="913"></A>every man, when once he hath practised virtue, scorns the name of villain. 
<A NAME="914"></A>Courage may be learnt, for even a babe doth learn to speak and hear things 
<A NAME="915"></A>it cannot comprehend; and whatso'er a child hath learnt, this it is his 
<A NAME="916"></A>wont to treasure up till he is old. So train up your children in a virtuous

<A NAME="1101"></A>should have fallen on such evil days as these,-I who did beget a brave 
<A NAME="1102"></A>young son, proud parent that I was, and after all am now bereft of him. 
<A NAME="1103"></A>Enough of this. What remains for such a hapless wretch as me? Shall I to 
<A NAME="1104"></A>my home, there to see its utter desolation and the blank within my life? 
<A NAME="1105"></A>or shall to the halls of that dead Capaneus?-halls I smiled to see in days 
<A NAME="1106"></A>gone by, when yet my daughter was alive. But she is lost and gone, she 
<A NAME="1107"></A>that would ever draw down my cheek to her lips, and take my head between 
<A NAME="1108"></A>her hands; for naught is there more sweet unto an aged sire than a daughter's 
<A NAME="1109"></A>love; our sons are made of sterner stuff, but less winning are their caresses. 
<A NAME="1110"></A>Oh! take me to my house at once, in darkness hide me there, to waste and 
<A NAME="1111"></A>fret this aged frame with fasting! What shall it avail me to touch my daughter's 
<A NAME="1112"></A>bones? Old age, resistless foe, how do I loathe thy presence! Them too 
<A NAME="1113"></A>I hate, whoso desire to lengthen out the span of life, seeking to turn 
<A NAME="1114"></A>the tide of death aside by philtres, drugs, and magic spells,-folk that 
<A NAME="1115"></A>death should take away to leave the young their place, when they no more 
<A NAME="1116"></A>can benefit the world. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="1206"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Hearken, Theseus, to the words that I Athena utter, telling 
<A NAME="1207"></A>thee thy duty, which, if thou perform it, will serve thy city. Give not 
<A NAME="1208"></A>these bones to the children to carry to the land of Argos, letting them 
<A NAME="1209"></A>go so lightly; nay, take first an oath of them that they will requite thee 
<A NAME="1210"></A>and thy city for your efforts. This oath must Adrastus swear, for as their 
<A NAME="1211"></A>king it is his right to take the oath for the whole realm of Argos. And 
<A NAME="1212"></A>this shall be the form thereof: "We Argives swear we never will against 
<A NAME="1213"></A>this land lead on our mail-clad troops to war, and, if others come, we 
<A NAME="1214"></A>will repel them." But if they violate their oath and come against the city, 
<A NAME="1215"></A>pray that the land of Argos may be miserably destroyed. Now hearken while 
<A NAME="1216"></A>I tell thee where thou must slay the victims. Thou hast within thy halls 
<A NAME="1217"></A>a tripod with brazen feet, which Heracles, in days gone by, after he had 
<A NAME="1218"></A>o'erthrown the foundations of Ilium and was starting on another enterprise, 
<A NAME="1219"></A>enjoined the to set up at the Pythian shrine. O'er it cut the throats of 
<A NAME="1220"></A>three sheep; then grave within the tripod's hollow belly the oath; this 
<A NAME="1221"></A>done, deliver it to the god who watches over Delphi to keep, a witness 
<A NAME="1222"></A>and memorial unto Hellas of the oath. And bury the sharp-edged knife, wherewith 
<A NAME="1223"></A>thou shalt have laid the victims open and shed their blood, deep in the 
<A NAME="1224"></A>bowels of the earth, hard by the pyres where the seven chieftains burn; 
<A NAME="1225"></A>for its appearance shall strike them with dismay, if e'er against thy town 
<A NAME="1226"></A>they come, and shall cause them to return with sorrow. When thou hast done 
<A NAME="1227"></A>all this, dismiss the dead from thy land. And to the god resign as sacred 
<A NAME="1228"></A>land the spot where their bodies were purified by fire, there by the meeting 
<A NAME="1229"></A>of the triple roads that lead unto the Isthmus. Thus much to thee, Theseus, 
<A NAME="1230"></A>address; next to the sons of Argos I speak; when ye are grown to men's 
<A NAME="1231"></A>estate, the town beside Ismenus shall ye sack, avenging the slaughter of 
<A NAME="1232"></A>your dead sires; thou too, Aegialeus, shalt take thy father's place and 
<A NAME="1233"></A>in thy youth command the host, and with thee Tydeus' son marching from 
<A NAME="1234"></A>Aetolia,-him whom his father named Diomedes. Soon as the beards your cheeks 
<A NAME="1235"></A>o'ershadow must ye lead an armed Danaid host against the battlements of 
<A NAME="1236"></A>Thebes with sevenfold gates. For to their sorrow shall ye come like lion's 
<A NAME="1237"></A>whelps in full-grown might to sack their city. No otherwise is it to be; 
<A NAME="1238"></A>and ye shall be a theme for minstrels' songs in days to come, known through 
<A NAME="1239"></A>Hellas as "the After-born"; so famous shall your expedition be, thanks
