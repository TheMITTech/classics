<A NAME="23"></A><B>ANDROMACHE</B>
<A NAME="24"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>O city of Thebes, glory of Asia, whence on a day I came to 
<A NAME="25"></A>Priam's princely home with many a rich and costly thing in my dower, affianced 
<A NAME="26"></A>unto Hector to be the mother of his children, I Andromache, envied name 
<A NAME="27"></A>in days of yore, but now of all women that have been or yet shall be the 
<A NAME="28"></A>most unfortunate; for I have lived to see my husband Hector slain by Achilles, 
<A NAME="29"></A>and the babe Astyanax, whom I bore my lord, hurled from the towering battlements, 
<A NAME="30"></A>when the Hellenes sacked our Trojan home; and I myself am come to Hellas 
<A NAME="31"></A>as a slave, though I was esteemed a daughter of a race most free, given 
<A NAME="32"></A>to Neoptolemus that island-prince, and set apart for him as his special 
<A NAME="33"></A>prize from the spoils of Troy. And here I dwell upon the boundaries of 
<A NAME="34"></A>Phthia and Pharsalia's town, where Thetis erst, the goddess of the sea, 
<A NAME="35"></A>abode with Peleus apart from the world, avoiding the throng of men; wherefore 
<A NAME="36"></A>the folk of Thessaly call it the sacred place of Thetis, in honour of the 
<A NAME="37"></A>goddess's marriage. Here dwells the son of Achilles and suffers Peleus 
<A NAME="38"></A>still to rule Pharsalia, not wishing to assume the sceptre while the old 
<A NAME="39"></A>man lives. Within these halls have borne a boy to the son of Achilles, 
<A NAME="40"></A>my master. Now aforetime for all my misery I ever had a hope to lead me 
<A NAME="41"></A>on, that, if my child were safe, I might find some help and protection 
<A NAME="42"></A>from my woes; but since my lord in scorn of his bondmaid's charms hath 
<A NAME="43"></A>wedded that Spartan Hermione, I am tormented by her most cruelly; for she 
<A NAME="44"></A>saith that I by secret enchantment am making her barren and distasteful 
<A NAME="45"></A>to her husband, and that I design to take her place in this house, ousting 
<A NAME="46"></A>her the rightful mistress by force; whereas I at first submitted against 
<A NAME="47"></A>my will and now have resigned my place; be almighty Zeus my witness that 
<A NAME="48"></A>it was not of my own free will I became her rival!
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>But I cannot convince her, and she longs to kill me, and her father 
<A NAME="50"></A>Menelaus is an accomplice in this. E'en now is he within, arrived from 
<A NAME="51"></A>Sparta for this very purpose, while I in terror am come to take up position 
<A NAME="52"></A>here in the shrine of Thetis adjoining the house, if haply it may save 
<A NAME="53"></A>me from death; for Peleus and his descendants hold it in honour as symbol 
<A NAME="54"></A>of his marriage with the Nereid. My only son am I secretly conveying to 
<A NAME="55"></A>a neighbour's house in fear for his life. For his sire stands not by my 
<A NAME="56"></A>side to lend his aid and cannot avail his child at all, being absent in 
<A NAME="57"></A>the land of Delphi, where he is offering recompense to Loxias for the madness 
<A NAME="58"></A>he committed, when on a day he went to Pytho and demanded of Phoebus satisfaction 
<A NAME="59"></A>for his father's death, if haply his prayer might avert those past sins 
<A NAME="60"></A>and win for him the god's goodwill hereafter. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="62"></A><B>MAID</B>
<A NAME="63"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Mistress mine, be sure I do not hesitate to call thee by that 
<A NAME="64"></A>name, seeing that I thought it thy right in thine own house also, when 
<A NAME="65"></A>we dwelt in Troy-land; as I was ever thy friend and thy husband's while 
<A NAME="66"></A>yet he was alive, so now have I come with strange tidings, in terror lest 
<A NAME="67"></A>any of our masters learn hereof but still out of pity for thee; for Menelaus 
<A NAME="68"></A>and his daughter are forming dire plots against thee, whereof thou must 
<A NAME="69"></A>beware. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="70"></A><B>ANDROMACHE</B>
<A NAME="71"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ah! kind companion of my bondage, for such thou art to her, 
<A NAME="72"></A>who, erst thy queen, is now sunk in misery; what are they doing? What new 
<A NAME="73"></A>schemes are they devising in their eagerness to take away my wretched life? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="74"></A><B>MAID</B>
<A NAME="75"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Alas! poor lady, they intend to slay thy son, whom thou hast 
<A NAME="76"></A>privily conveyed from out the house. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="77"></A><B>ANDROMACHE</B>
<A NAME="78"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ah me! Has she heard that my babe was put out of her reach? 
<A NAME="79"></A>Who told her? Woe is me! how utterly undone! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="80"></A><B>MAID</B>
<A NAME="81"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I know not, but thus much of their schemes I heard myself; 
<A NAME="82"></A>and Menelaus has left the house to fetch him. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="83"></A><B>ANDROMACHE</B>
<A NAME="84"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Then am I lost; ah, my child! those vultures twain will take 
<A NAME="85"></A>and slay thee; while he who is called thy father lingers still in Delphi. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="86"></A><B>MAID</B>
<A NAME="87"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>True, for had he been here thou wouldst not have fared so hardly, 
<A NAME="88"></A>am sure; but, as it is, thou art friendless. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="89"></A><B>ANDROMACHE</B>

<A NAME="107"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Dost look to that? Thou art disowning thy friends in distress.

<A NAME="108"></A><B>MAID</B>
<A NAME="109"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Not so; never taunt me with that. I will go, for of a truth 
<A NAME="110"></A>a woman and a slave is not of much account, e'en if aught befall me.

<A NAME="111"></A><I>The MAID withdraws.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="112"></A><B>ANDROMACHE</B>
<A NAME="113"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Go then, while I will tell to heaven the lengthy tale of lamentation, 
<A NAME="114"></A>mourning, and weeping, that has ever been my hard lot; for 'tis woman's 
<A NAME="115"></A>way to delight in present misfortunes even to keeping them always on her 
<A NAME="116"></A>tongue and lips. But I have many reasons, not merely one for tears,-my 
<A NAME="117"></A>city's fall, my Hector's death, the hardness of the lot to which I am bound, 
<A NAME="118"></A>since I fell on slavery's evil days undeservedly. 'Tis never right to call 
<A NAME="119"></A>a son of man happy, till thou hast seen his end, to judge from the way 
<A NAME="120"></A>he passes it how he will descend to that other world. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="121"></A><I>She begins to chant.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="122"></A>'Twas no bride Paris took with him to the towers of Ilium, but curse to 
<A NAME="123"></A>his bed when he brought Helen to her bower. For her sake, Troy, did eager 
<A NAME="124"></A>warriors, sailing from Hellas in a thousand ships, capture and make thee 
<A NAME="125"></A>a prey to fire and sword; and the son of sea-born Thetis mounted on his 
<A NAME="126"></A>chariot dragged my husband Hector round the walls, ah woe is me! while 
<A NAME="127"></A>I was hurried from my chamber to the beach, with slavery's hateful pall 
<A NAME="128"></A>upon me. And many tear I shed as I left my city, my bridal bower, and my 
<A NAME="129"></A>husband in the dust. Woe, woe is me! why should I prolong my life, to serve 
<A NAME="130"></A>Hermione? Her cruelty it is that drives me hither to the image of the goddess 
<A NAME="131"></A>to throw my suppliant arms about it, melting to tears as doth a spring 
<A NAME="132"></A>that gushes from the rock. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="136"></A><I>strophe 1</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="137"></A>Lady, thus keeping thy weary station without pause upon the floor of Thetis' 
<A NAME="138"></A>shrine, Phthian though I am, to thee a daughter of Asia I come, to see 
<A NAME="139"></A>if I can devise some remedy for these perplexing troubles, which have involved 
<A NAME="140"></A>thee and Hermione in fell discord, because to thy sorrow thou sharest with 
<A NAME="141"></A>her the love of Achilles' son. <BR><BR><I>antistrophe 
<A NAME="142"></A>1</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="143"></A>Recognize thy position, weigh the present evil into the which thou art 
<A NAME="144"></A>come. Thou art a Trojan captive; thy rival is thy mistress, a true-born 
<A NAME="145"></A>daughter of Sparta. Leave then this home of sacrifice, the shrine of our 
<A NAME="146"></A>sea-goddess. How can it avail thee to waste thy comeliness and disfigure 
<A NAME="147"></A>it by weeping by reason of a mistress's harsh usage? Might will prevail 
<A NAME="148"></A>against thee; why vainly toil in thy feebleness? <BR><BR><I>strophe 
<A NAME="149"></A>2</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="150"></A>Come, quit the bright sanctuary of the Nereid divine. Recognize that thou 
<A NAME="151"></A>art in bondage on a foreign soil, in a strange city, where thou seest none 
<A NAME="152"></A>of all thy friends, luckless lady, cast on evil days. <BR><BR><I>antistrophe 
<A NAME="153"></A>2</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="154"></A>Yea, I did pity thee most truly, Trojan dame, when thou camest to this 
<A NAME="155"></A>house; but from fear of my mistress I hold my peace, albeit I sympathize 
<A NAME="156"></A>with thee, lest she, whom Zeus's daughter bore, discover my good will toward 
<A NAME="157"></A>thee. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="158"></A><I>HERMIONE enters, in complete royal regalia.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="159"></A><B>HERMIONE</B>
<A NAME="160"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>With a crown of golden workmanship upon my head and about my 
<A NAME="161"></A>body this embroidered robe am I come hither; no presents these I wear from 
<A NAME="162"></A>the palace of Achilles or Peleus, but gifts my father Menelaus gave me 
<A NAME="163"></A>together with a sumptuous dower from Sparta in Laconia, to insure me freedom 
<A NAME="164"></A>of speech. Such is my answer to you; </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="165"></A><I>to the CHORUS</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="166"></A>but as for thee, slave and captive, thou wouldst fain oust me and secure 
<A NAME="167"></A>this palace for thyself, and thanks to thy enchantment I am hated by my 
<A NAME="168"></A>husband; thou it is that hast made my womb barren and cheated my hopes; 
<A NAME="169"></A>for Asia's daughters have clever heads for such villainy; yet will I check 
<A NAME="170"></A>thee therefrom, nor shall this temple of the Nereid avail thee aught, no! 
<A NAME="171"></A>neither its altar or shrine, but thou shalt die. But if or god or man should 
<A NAME="172"></A>haply wish to save thee, thou must atone for thy proud thoughts of happier 
<A NAME="173"></A>days now past by humbling thyself and crouching prostrate at my knees, 
<A NAME="174"></A>by sweeping out my halls, and by learning, as thou sprinklest water from 
<A NAME="175"></A>a golden ewer, where thou now art. Here is no Hector, no Priam with his 
<A NAME="176"></A>gold, but a city of Hellas. Yet thou, miserable woman, hast gone so far 
<A NAME="177"></A>in wantonness that thou canst lay thee down with the son of the very man 
<A NAME="178"></A>that slew thy husband, and bear children to the murderer. Such is all the 
<A NAME="179"></A>race of barbarians; father and daughter, mother and son, sister and brother 
<A NAME="180"></A>mate together; the nearest and dearest stain their path with each other's 
<A NAME="181"></A>blood, and no law restrains such horrors. Bring not these crimes amongst 
<A NAME="182"></A>us, for here we count it shame that one man should have the control of 
<A NAME="183"></A>two wives, and men are content to turn to one lawful love, that is, all 
<A NAME="184"></A>who care to live an honourable life. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="185"></A><B>LEADER OF THE CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="186"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Women are by nature somewhat jealous, and do ever show the 
<A NAME="187"></A>keenest hate to rivals in their love. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="188"></A><B>ANDROMACHE</B>
<A NAME="189"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ah! well-a-day! Youth is a bane to mortals, in every case, 
<A NAME="190"></A>that is, where a man embraces injustice in his early days. Now I am afraid 
<A NAME="191"></A>that my being a slave will prevent thee listening to me in spite of many 
<A NAME="192"></A>a just plea, or if I win my case, I fear I may be damaged on this very 
<A NAME="193"></A>ground, for the high and mighty cannot brook refuting arguments from their 
<A NAME="194"></A>inferiors; still I will not be convicted of betraying my own cause. Tell 
<A NAME="195"></A>me, proud young wife, what assurance can make me confident of wresting 
<A NAME="196"></A>from thee thy lawful lord? Is it that Laconia's capital yields to Phrygia? 
<A NAME="197"></A>is it that my fortune outstrips thine? or that in me thou seest a free 
<A NAME="198"></A>woman? Am I so elated by my youth, my full healthy figure, the extent of 
<A NAME="199"></A>my city, the number of my friends that I wish to supplant thee in thy home? 
<A NAME="200"></A>Is my purpose to take thy place and rear myself a race of slaves, mere 
<A NAME="201"></A>appendages to my misery? or, supposing thou bear no children, will any 
<A NAME="202"></A>one endure that sons of mine should rule o'er Phthia? Ah no! there is the 
<A NAME="203"></A>love that Hellas bears me, both for Hector's sake and for my own humble 
<A NAME="204"></A>rank forsooth, that never knew a queen's estate in Troy. 'Tis not my sorcery 
<A NAME="205"></A>that makes thy husband hate thee, nay, but thy own failure to prove thyself 
<A NAME="206"></A>his help-meet. Herein lies love's only charm; 'tis not beauty, lady, but 
<A NAME="207"></A>virtuous acts that win our husbands' hearts. And though it gall thee to 
<A NAME="208"></A>be told so, albeit thy city in Laconia is no doubt mighty fact, yet thou 
<A NAME="209"></A>findest no place for his Scyros, displaying wealth 'midst poverty and setting 
<A NAME="210"></A>Menelaus above Achilles: and that is what alienates thy lord. Take heed; 
<A NAME="211"></A>for a woman, though bestowed upon worthless husband, must be with him content, 
<A NAME="212"></A>and ne'er advance presumptuous claims. Suppose thou hadst wedded a prince 
<A NAME="213"></A>of Thrace, the land of flood and melting snow, where one lord shares his 
<A NAME="214"></A>affections with a host of wives, wouldst thou have slain them? If so, thou 
<A NAME="215"></A>wouldst have set a stigma of insatiate lust on all our sex. A shameful 
<A NAME="216"></A>charge! And yet herein we suffer more than men, though we make a good stand 
<A NAME="217"></A>against it. Ah! my dear lord Hector, for thy sake would I e'en brook a 
<A NAME="218"></A>rival, if ever Cypris led thee astray, and oft in days gone by I held thy 
<A NAME="219"></A>bastard babes to my own breast, to spare thee any cause for grief. By this 
<A NAME="220"></A>course I bound my husband to me by virtue's chains, whereas thou wilt never 
<A NAME="221"></A>so much as let the drops of dew from heaven above settle on thy lord, in 
<A NAME="222"></A>thy jealous fear. Oh! seek not to surpass thy mother in hankering after 
<A NAME="223"></A>men, for 'tis well that all wise children should avoid the habits of such 
<A NAME="224"></A>evil mothers. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="336"></A>have aught but the accidental appearance of wisdom. Thou for instance, 
<A NAME="337"></A>caitiff that thou art, didst thou ever wrest Troy from Priam with thy picked 
<A NAME="338"></A>troops of Hellenes? thou that hast raised such a storm, at the word of 
<A NAME="339"></A>thy daughter, a mere child, and hast entered the lists with a poor captive; 
<A NAME="340"></A>unworthy I count thee of Troy's capture, and Troy still more disgraced 
<A NAME="341"></A>by thy victory. Those who only in appearance are men of sense make an outward 
<A NAME="342"></A>show, but inwardly resemble the common herd, save it be in wealth, which 
<A NAME="343"></A>is their chiefest strength.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>Come now, Menelaus, let us carry through this argument. Suppose 
<A NAME="345"></A>I am slain by thy daughter, and she work her will on me, yet can she never 
<A NAME="346"></A>escape the pollution of murder, and public opinion will make thee too an 
<A NAME="347"></A>accomplice in this deed of blood, for thy share in the business must needs 
<A NAME="348"></A>implicate thee. But even supposing I escape death myself, will ye kill 
<A NAME="349"></A>my child? Even then, how will his father brook the murder of his child? 
<A NAME="350"></A>Troy has no such coward's tale to tell of him; nay, he will follow duty's 
<A NAME="351"></A>call; his actions will prove him a worthy scion of Peleus and Achilles. 
<A NAME="352"></A>Thy daughter will be thrust forth from his house; and what wilt thou say 
<A NAME="353"></A>when seeking to betroth her to another? wilt say her virtue made her leave 
<A NAME="354"></A>a worthless lord? Nay, that will be false. Who then will wed her? wilt 
<A NAME="355"></A>thou keep her without a husband in thy halls, grown grey in widowhood? 
<A NAME="356"></A>Unhappy wretch! dost not see the flood-gates of trouble opening wide for 
<A NAME="357"></A>thee? How many a wrong against a wife wouldst thou prefer thy daughter 
<A NAME="358"></A>to have found to suffering what I now describe? We ought not on trifling 
<A NAME="359"></A>grounds to promote great ills; nor should men, if we women are so deadly 
<A NAME="360"></A>a curse, bring their nature down to our level. No! if, as thy daughter 
<A NAME="361"></A>asserts, I am practising sorcery against her and making her barren, right 
<A NAME="362"></A>willingly will I, without any crouching at altars, submit in my own person 
<A NAME="363"></A>to the penalty that lies in her husband's hands, seeing that I am no less 
<A NAME="364"></A>chargeable with injuring him if I make him childless. This is my case; 
<A NAME="365"></A>but for thee, there is one thing I fear in thy disposition; it was a quarrel 
<A NAME="366"></A>for a woman that really induced thee to destroy poor Ilium's town.

<A NAME="376"></A>if she loses her husband's love she loses her life therewith. Now, as it

<A NAME="398"></A>Hector's murderer as his mistress. What pleasure then has life for me? 
<A NAME="399"></A>Whither am I to turn my gaze? to the present or the past? My babe alone 
<A NAME="400"></A>was left me, the light of my life, and him these ministers of death would 
<A NAME="401"></A>slay. No! they shall not, if my poor life can save him; for if he be saved, 
<A NAME="402"></A>hope in him lives on, while to me 'twere shame to refuse to die for my 
<A NAME="403"></A>son. Lo! here I leave the altar and give myself into your hands, to cut 
<A NAME="404"></A>or stab, to bind or hang. Ah! my child, to Hades now thy mother passes 
<A NAME="405"></A>to save thy dear life. Yet if thou escape thy doom, remember me, my sufferings 
<A NAME="406"></A>and my death, and tell thy father how I fared, with fond caress and streaming 
<A NAME="407"></A>eye and arms thrown round his neck. Ah! yes, his children are to every

<A NAME="593"></A>the cursed woman thou hadst there was a model of virtue. No! a Spartan 
<A NAME="594"></A>maid could not be chaste, e'en if she would, who leaves her home and bares 
<A NAME="595"></A>her limbs and lets her robe float free, to share with youths their races 
<A NAME="596"></A>and their sports,-customs I cannot away with. Is it any wonder then that 
<A NAME="597"></A>ye fail to educate your women in virtue? Helen might have asked thee this, 
<A NAME="598"></A>seeing that she said goodbye to thy affection and tripped off with her 
<A NAME="599"></A>young gallant to a foreign land. And yet for her sake thou didst marshal 
<A NAME="600"></A>all the hosts of Hellas and lead them to Ilium, whereas thou shouldst have 
<A NAME="601"></A>shown thy loathing for her by refusing to stir a spear, once thou hadst 
<A NAME="602"></A>found her false; yea, thou shouldst have let her stay there, and even paid 
<A NAME="603"></A>a price to save ever having her back again. But that was not at all the 
<A NAME="604"></A>way thy thoughts were turned; wherefore many a brave life hast thou ended, 
<A NAME="605"></A>and many an aged mother hast thou left childless in her home, and grey-haired 
<A NAME="606"></A>sires of gallant sons hast reft. Of that sad band am I member, seeing in 
<A NAME="607"></A>thee Achilles' murderer like a malignant fiend; for thou and thou alone 
<A NAME="608"></A>hast returned from Troy without a scratch, bringing back thy splendid weapons 
<A NAME="609"></A>in their splendid cases just as they went. As for me, I ever told that 
<A NAME="610"></A>amorous boy to form no alliance with thee nor take unto his home an evil 
<A NAME="611"></A>mother's child; for daughters bear the marks of their mothers' ill-repute 
<A NAME="612"></A>into their new homes. Wherefore, ye wooers, take heed to this my warning: 
<A NAME="613"></A>"Choose the daughter of a good mother." And more than this, with what wanton 
<A NAME="614"></A>insult didst thou treat thy brother, bidding him sacrifice his daughter 
<A NAME="615"></A>in his simpleness! So fearful wast thou of losing thy worthless wife. Then 
<A NAME="616"></A>after capturing Troy,-for thither too will I accompany thee,-thou didst 
<A NAME="617"></A>not slay that woman, when she was in thy power; but as soon as thine eyes 
<A NAME="618"></A>caught sight of her breast, thy sword was dropped and thou didst take her 
<A NAME="619"></A>kisses, fondling the shameless traitress, too weak to stem thy hot desire, 
<A NAME="620"></A>thou caitiff wretch! Yet spite of all thou art the man to come and work 
<A NAME="621"></A>havoc in my grandson's halls when he is absent, seeking to slay with all 
<A NAME="622"></A>indignity a poor weak woman and her babe: but that babe shall one day make 
<A NAME="623"></A>thee and thy daughter in thy home rue it, e'en though his birth be trebly 
<A NAME="624"></A>base. Yea, for oft ere now hath seed, sown on barren soil, prevailed o'er 
<A NAME="625"></A>rich deep tilth, and many bastard has proved a better man than children 
<A NAME="626"></A>better born. Take thy daughter hence with thee! Far better is it for mortals 
<A NAME="627"></A>to have a poor honest man either as married kin or friend than a wealthy 
<A NAME="628"></A>knave; but as for thee, thou art a thing of naught.

<A NAME="638"></A>shouldst have banished her far beyond the streams of Nile or Phasis, and 
<A NAME="639"></A>ever encouraged me; seeing that she comes from Asia's continent where fell 
<A NAME="640"></A>so many of the sons of Hellas, victims to the spear; and likewise because 
<A NAME="641"></A>she shared in the spilling of thy son's blood; for Paris who slew thy son 
<A NAME="642"></A>Achilles, was brother to Hector, whose wife she was. And dost thou enter 
<A NAME="643"></A>the same abode with her, and deign to let her share thy board, and suffer 
<A NAME="644"></A>her to rear her brood of vipers in thy house? But I, after all this foresight 
<A NAME="645"></A>for thee, old man, and myself, am to have her torn from my clutches for 
<A NAME="646"></A>wishing to slay her. Yet come now, for 'tis no disgrace to argue; suppose 
<A NAME="647"></A>my daughter has no child, while this woman's sons grow up, wilt thou set 
<A NAME="648"></A>them up to rule the land of Phthia, barbarians born and bred to lord it 
<A NAME="649"></A>over Hellenes? Am I then so void of sense because I hate injustice, and 
<A NAME="650"></A>thou so full of cleverness? Consider yet another point; say thou hadst 
<A NAME="651"></A>given a daughter of thine to some citizen, and hadst then seen her thus 
<A NAME="652"></A>treated, wouldst thou have sat looking on in silence? I trow not. Dost 
<A NAME="653"></A>thou then for a foreigner rail thus at thy nearest friends? Again, thou 
<A NAME="654"></A>mayst say, husband and wife have an equally strong case if she is wronged 
<A NAME="655"></A>by him, and similarly if he find her guilty of indiscretion in his house; 
<A NAME="656"></A>yet while he has ample powers in his own hands, she depends on parents 
<A NAME="657"></A>and friends for her case. Surely then I am right in helping my own kin! 
<A NAME="658"></A>Thou art in thy dotage; for thou wilt do me more good by speaking of my 
<A NAME="659"></A>generalship than by concealing it. Helen's trouble was not of her own choosing, 
<A NAME="660"></A>but sent by heaven, and it proved a great benefit to Hellas; her sons, 
<A NAME="661"></A>till then untried in war or arms, turned to deeds of prowess, and it is 
<A NAME="662"></A>experience which teaches man all he knows. I showed my wisdom in refraining 
<A NAME="663"></A>from slaying my wife, directly I caught sight of her. Would that thou too 
<A NAME="664"></A>hadst ne'er slain Phocus! All this I bring before thee in pure good-will,

<A NAME="899"></A>for these very walls seem to cry out "Begone!" and all the land of Phthia 
<A NAME="900"></A>hates me. But if my lord return ere that from the oracle of Phoebus, he 
<A NAME="901"></A>will put me to death on a shameful charge, or enslave me to his mistress, 
<A NAME="902"></A>whom ruled before. Maybe some one will say, "How was it thou didst go thus 
<A NAME="903"></A>astray?" I was ruined by evil women who came to me and puffed me up with 
<A NAME="904"></A>words like these: "Wait! wilt thou suffer that vile captive, a mere bondmaid, 
<A NAME="905"></A>to dwell within thy house and share thy wedded rights? By Heaven's queen! 
<A NAME="906"></A>if it were my house she should not live to reap my marriage-harvest!" And 
<A NAME="907"></A>I listened to the words of these Sirens, the cunning, knavish, subtle praters, 
<A NAME="908"></A>and was filled with silly thoughts. What need had I to care about my lord? 
<A NAME="909"></A>I had all I wanted, wealth in plenty, a house in which I was mistress, 
<A NAME="910"></A>and as for children, mine would be born in wedlock, while hers would be

<A NAME="927"></A>see whether thou wouldst stay here or from fear of that captive art minded

<A NAME="929"></A>brought me thither, as the intention of carrying thee away from this house, 
<A NAME="930"></A>if, as now, thou shouldst grant me a chance of saying so. For thou wert 
<A NAME="931"></A>mine formerly, but art now living with thy present husband through thy 
<A NAME="932"></A>father's baseness; since he, before invading Troy's domains, betrothed 
<A NAME="933"></A>thee to me, and then afterwards promised thee to thy present lord, provided 
<A NAME="934"></A>he captured the city of Troy.
<A NAME="935"></A><BR><BR>So, as soon as Achilles' son returned hither, I forgave thy father, 
<A NAME="936"></A>but entreated the bridegroom to forego his marriage with thee, telling 
<A NAME="937"></A>him all I had endured and my present misfortune; I might get a wife, I 
<A NAME="938"></A>said, from amongst friends, but outside their circle 'twas no easy task 
<A NAME="939"></A>for one exiled like myself from home. Thereat he grew abusive, taunting 
<A NAME="940"></A>me with my mother's murder and those blood-boltered fiends. And I was humbled 
<A NAME="941"></A>by the fortunes of my house, and though 'tis true, I grieved, yet did I 
<A NAME="942"></A>bear my sorrow, and reluctantly departed, robbed of thy promised hand. 
<A NAME="943"></A>Now therefore, since thou findest thy fortune so abruptly changed and art 
<A NAME="944"></A>fallen thus on evil days and hast no help, I will take thee hence and place 
<A NAME="945"></A>thee in thy father's hands. For kinship hath strong claims, and in adversity

<A NAME="1049"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>As soon as we reached the famous soil of Phoebus, for three 
<A NAME="1050"></A>whole days were we feasting our eyes with the sight. And this, it seems, 
<A NAME="1051"></A>caused suspicion; for the folk, who dwell near the god's shrine, began 
<A NAME="1052"></A>to collect in groups, while Agamemnon's son, going to and fro through the 
<A NAME="1053"></A>town, would whisper in each man's ear malignant hints: "Do ye see yon fellow, 
<A NAME="1054"></A>going in and out of the god's treasure-chambers, which are full of the 
<A NAME="1055"></A>gold stored there by all mankind? He is come hither a second time on the 
<A NAME="1056"></A>same mission as before, eager to sack the temple of Phoebus." Thereon there 
<A NAME="1057"></A>ran an angry murmur through the city, and the magistrates flocked to their 
<A NAME="1058"></A>council-chamber, while those, who have charge of the god's treasures, had 
<A NAME="1059"></A>a guard privately placed amongst the colonnades. But we, knowing naught 
<A NAME="1060"></A>as yet of this, took sheep fed in the pastures of Parnassus, and went our 
<A NAME="1061"></A>way and stationed ourselves at the altars with vouchers and Pythian seers. 
<A NAME="1062"></A>And one said: "What prayer, young warrior, wouldst thou have us offer to 
<A NAME="1063"></A>the god? Wherefore art thou come?" And he answered: "I wish to make atonement 
<A NAME="1064"></A>to Phoebus for my past transgression; for once I claimed from him satisfaction 
<A NAME="1065"></A>for my father's blood." Thereupon the rumour, spread by Orestes, proved 
<A NAME="1066"></A>to have great weight, suggesting that my master was lying and had come 
<A NAME="1067"></A>on a shameful errand. But he crosses the threshold of the temple to pray 
<A NAME="1068"></A>to Phoebus before his oracle, and was busy with his burnt-offering; when 
<A NAME="1069"></A>a body of men armed with swords set themselves in ambush against him in 
<A NAME="1070"></A>the cover of the bay-trees, and Clytemnestra's son, that had contrived 
<A NAME="1071"></A>the whole plot was one of them. There stood the young man praying to the 
<A NAME="1072"></A>god in sight of all, when lo! with their sharp swords they stabbed Achilles' 
<A NAME="1073"></A>unprotected son from behind. But he stepped back, for it was not a mortal 
<A NAME="1074"></A>wound he had received, and drew his sword, and snatching armour from the 
<A NAME="1075"></A>pegs where it hung on a pillar, took his stand upon the altar-steps, the 
<A NAME="1076"></A>picture of a warrior grim; then cried he to the sons of Delphi, and asked 
<A NAME="1077"></A>them: "Why seek to slay me when I am come on a holy mission? What cause 
<A NAME="1078"></A>is there why I should die? But of all that throng of bystanders, no man 
<A NAME="1079"></A>answered him a word, but they set to hurling stones. Then he, though bruised 
<A NAME="1080"></A>and battered by the showers of missiles from all sides, covered himself 
<A NAME="1081"></A>behind his mail and tried to ward off the attack, holding his shield first 
<A NAME="1082"></A>here, then there, at arm's length, but all of no avail; for a storm of 
<A NAME="1083"></A>darts, arrows and javelins, hurtling spits with double points, and butchers' 
<A NAME="1084"></A>knives for slaying steers, came flying at his feet; and terrible was the 
<A NAME="1085"></A>war-dance thou hadst then seen thy grandson dance to avoid their marksmanship. 
<A NAME="1086"></A>At last, when they were hemming him in on all sides, allowing him no breathing 
<A NAME="1087"></A>space, he left the shelter of the altar, the hearth where victims are placed, 
<A NAME="1088"></A>and with one bound was on them as on the Trojans of yore; and they turned 
<A NAME="1089"></A>and fled like doves when they see the hawk. Many fell in the confusion: 
<A NAME="1090"></A>some wounded, and others trodden down by one another along the narrow passages; 
<A NAME="1091"></A>and in that hushed holy house uprose unholy din and echoed back from the 
<A NAME="1092"></A>rocks. Calm and still my master stood there in his gleaming harness like 
<A NAME="1093"></A>a flash of light, till from the inmost shrine there came a voice of thrilling 
<A NAME="1094"></A>horror, stirring the crowd to make a stand. Then fell Achilles' son, smitten 
<A NAME="1095"></A>through the flank by some Delphian's biting blade, some fellow that slew 
<A NAME="1096"></A>him with a host to help; and as he fell, there was not one that did not 
<A NAME="1097"></A>stab him, or cast a rock and batter his corpse. So his whole body, once 
<A NAME="1098"></A>so fair, was marred with savage wounds. At last they cast the lifeless 
<A NAME="1099"></A>clay, Iying near the altar, forth from the fragrant fane. And we gathered 
<A NAME="1100"></A>up his remains forthwith and are bringing them to thee, old prince, to 
<A NAME="1101"></A>mourn and weep and honour with a deep-dug tomb.
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR><BR>This is how that prince who vouchsafeth oracles to others, that 
<A NAME="1103"></A>judge of what is right for all the world, hath revenged himself on Achilles' 
<A NAME="1104"></A>son, remembering his ancient quarrel as a wicked man would. How then can 
<A NAME="1105"></A>he be wise? </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="1172"></A>O Peleus! because of my wedded days with thee now long agone, I Thetis 
<A NAME="1173"></A>am come from the halls of Nereus. And first I counsel thee not to grieve 
<A NAME="1174"></A>to excess in thy present distress, for I too who need ne'er have borne 
<A NAME="1175"></A>children to my sorrow, have lost the child of our love, Achilles swift 
<A NAME="1176"></A>of foot, foremost of the sons of Hellas. Next will I declare why I am come, 
<A NAME="1177"></A>and do thou give ear. Carry yonder corpse, Achilles' son, to the Pythian 
<A NAME="1178"></A>altar and there bury it, a reproach to Delphi, that his tomb may proclaim 
<A NAME="1179"></A>the violent death he met at the hand of Orestes. And for his captive wife 
<A NAME="1180"></A>Andromache,-she must dwell in the Molossian land, united in honourable 
<A NAME="1181"></A>wedlock with Helenus, and with her this babe, the sole survivor as he is 
<A NAME="1182"></A>of all the line of Aeacus, for from him a succession of prosperous kings 
<A NAME="1183"></A>of Molossia is to go on unbroken; for the race that springs from thee and 
<A NAME="1184"></A>me, my aged lord, must not thus be brought to naught; no! nor Troy's line 
<A NAME="1185"></A>either; for her fate too is cared for by the gods, albeit her fall was 
<A NAME="1186"></A>due to the eager wish of Pallas. Thee too, that thou mayst know the saving 
<A NAME="1187"></A>grace of wedding me, will I, a goddess born and daughter of a god, release 
<A NAME="1188"></A>from all the ills that flesh is heir to and make a deity to know not death 
<A NAME="1189"></A>nor decay. From henceforth in the halls of Nereus shalt thou dwell with 
<A NAME="1190"></A>me, god and goddess together; thence shalt thou rise dry-shod from out 
<A NAME="1191"></A>the main and see Achilles, our dear son, settled in his island-home by 
<A NAME="1192"></A>the strand of Leuce, that is girdled by the Euxine sea. But get thee to 
<A NAME="1193"></A>Delphi's god-built town, carrying this corpse with thee, and, after thou 
<A NAME="1194"></A>hast buried him, return and settle in the cave which time hath hollowed 
<A NAME="1195"></A>in the Sepian rock and there abide, till from the sea I come with choir 
<A NAME="1196"></A>of fifty Nereids to be thy escort thence; for fate's decree thou must fulfil; 
<A NAME="1197"></A>such is the pleasure of Zeus. Cease then to mourn the dead; this is the 
<A NAME="1198"></A>lot which heaven assigns to all, and all must pay their debt to death. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="1199"></A><B>PELEUS</B>
<A NAME="1200"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Great queen, my honoured wife, from Nereus sprung, all hail! 
<A NAME="1201"></A>thou art acting herein as befits thyself and thy children. So I will stay 
<A NAME="1202"></A>my grief at thy bidding, goddess, and, when I have buried the dead, will 
<A NAME="1203"></A>seek the glens of Pelion, even the place where I took thy beauteous form 
<A NAME="1204"></A>to my embrace. Surely after this every prudent man will seek to marry a 
<A NAME="1205"></A>wife of noble stock and give his daughter to a husband good and true, never 
<A NAME="1206"></A>setting his heart on a worthless woman, not even though she bring a sumptuous 
<A NAME="1207"></A>dowry to his house. So would men ne'er suffer ill at heaven's hand.

<A NAME="1211"></A>Many are the shapes of Heaven's denizens, and many a thing they bring to
