<A NAME="24"></A><B>JOCASTA</B>
<A NAME="25"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>O sun-god, who cleavest thy way along the starry sky, mounted 
<A NAME="26"></A>on golden-studded car, rolling on thy path of flame behind fleet coursers, 
<A NAME="27"></A>how curst the beam thou didst shed on Thebes, the day that Cadmus left 
<A NAME="28"></A>Phoenicia's realm beside the sea and reached this land! He it was that 
<A NAME="29"></A>in days long gone wedded Harmonia, the daughter of Cypris, and begat Polydorus 
<A NAME="30"></A>from whom they say sprung Labdacus, and Laius from him. I am known as the 
<A NAME="31"></A>daughter of Menoeceus, and Creon is my brother by the same mother. Men 
<A NAME="32"></A>called me Jocasta, for so my father named me, and I am married to Laius. 
<A NAME="33"></A>Now when he was still childless after being wedded to me a long time, he 
<A NAME="34"></A>went and questioned Phoebus, craving moreover that our love might be crowned 
<A NAME="35"></A>with sons born to his house. But the god said, "King of Thebes for horses 
<A NAME="36"></A>famed! seek not to beget children against the will of heaven; for if thou 
<A NAME="37"></A>beget a son, that child shall slay thee, and all thy house shall wade through 
<A NAME="38"></A>blood." But he, yielding to his lust in a drunken fit, begat a son of me, 
<A NAME="39"></A>and when his babe was born, conscious of his sin and of the god's warning, 
<A NAME="40"></A>he gave the child to shepherds to expose in Hera's meadow on mount Cithaeron, 
<A NAME="41"></A>after piercing his ankles with iron spikes; whence it was that Hellas named 
<A NAME="42"></A>him Oedipus. But the keepers of the horses of Polybus finding him took 
<A NAME="43"></A>him home and laid him in the arms of their mistress. So she suckled the 
<A NAME="44"></A>child that I had borne and persuaded her husband she was its mother. Soon 
<A NAME="45"></A>as my son was grown to man's estate, the tawny beard upon his cheek, either 
<A NAME="46"></A>because he had guessed the fraud or learnt it from another, he set out 
<A NAME="47"></A>for the shrine of Phoebus, eager to know for certain who his parents were; 
<A NAME="48"></A>and likewise Laius, my husband, was on his way thither, anxious to find 
<A NAME="49"></A>out if the child he had exposed was dead. And they twain met where the 
<A NAME="50"></A>branching roads to Phocis unite; and the charioteer of Laius called to 
<A NAME="51"></A>him, "Out of the way, stranger, room for my lord!" But he, with never a 
<A NAME="52"></A>word, strode on in his pride; and the horses with their hoofs drew blood 
<A NAME="53"></A>from the tendons of his feet. Then-but why need I tell aught beyond the 
<A NAME="54"></A>sad issue?-son slew father, and taking his chariot gave it to Polybus his 
<A NAME="55"></A>foster-father. Now when the Sphinx was grievously harrying our city after 
<A NAME="56"></A>my husband's death, my brother Creon proclaimed that he would wed me to 
<A NAME="57"></A>any who should guess the riddle of that crafty maiden. By some strange 
<A NAME="58"></A>chance, my own son, Oedipus, guessed the Sphinx's riddle, and so he became 
<A NAME="59"></A>king of this land and received its sceptre as his prize, and married his 
<A NAME="60"></A>mother, all unwitting, luckless wretch! nor did I his mother know that 
<A NAME="61"></A>I was wedded to my son; and I bore him two sons, Eteocles and the hero 
<A NAME="62"></A>Polyneices, and two daughters as well; the one her father called Ismene, 
<A NAME="63"></A>the other, which was the elder, I named Antigone. Now when Oedipus, that 
<A NAME="64"></A>awful sufferer, learnt that I his wedded wife was his mother too, he inflicted 
<A NAME="65"></A>a ghastly outrage upon his eyes, tearing the bleeding orbs with a golden 
<A NAME="66"></A>brooch. But since my sons have grown to bearded men, they have confined 
<A NAME="67"></A>their father closely, that his misfortune, needing as it did full many 
<A NAME="68"></A>a shift to hide it, might be forgotten. He is still living in the palace, 
<A NAME="69"></A>but his misfortunes have so unhinged him that he imprecates the most unholy 
<A NAME="70"></A>curses on his sons, praying that they may have to draw the sword before 
<A NAME="71"></A>they share this house between them. So they, fearful that heaven may accomplish 
<A NAME="72"></A>his prayer if they dwell together, have made an agreement, arranging that 
<A NAME="73"></A>Polyneices, the younger, should first leave the land in voluntary exile, 
<A NAME="74"></A>while Eteocles should stay and hold the sceptre for a year and then change 
<A NAME="75"></A>places. But as soon as Eteocles was seated high in power, he refused to 
<A NAME="76"></A>give up the throne, and drove Polyneices into exile from the kingdom; so 
<A NAME="77"></A>Polyneices went to Argos and married into the family of Adrastus, and having 
<A NAME="78"></A>collected a numerous force of Argives is leading them hither; and he is 
<A NAME="79"></A>come up against our seven-gated walls, demanding the sceptre of his father 
<A NAME="80"></A>and his share in the kingdom. Wherefore I, to end their strife, have prevailed 
<A NAME="81"></A>on one son to meet the other under truce, before appealing to arms; and 
<A NAME="82"></A>the messenger I sent tells me that he will come. O Zeus, whose home is 
<A NAME="83"></A>heaven's radiant vault, save us, and grant that my sons may be reconciled! 
<A NAME="84"></A>For thou, if thou art really wise, must not suffer the same poor mortal 
<A NAME="85"></A>to be for ever wretched. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="216"></A>From the Tyrian main I come, an offering choice for Loxias from Phoenician 
<A NAME="217"></A>isle, to minister to Phoebus in his halls, where his fane lies nestling 
<A NAME="218"></A>'neath the snow-swept peaks of Parnassus; over the Ionian sea I rowed my

<A NAME="222"></A>Chosen from my city as beauty's gift for Loxias, to the land of Cadmus

<A NAME="296"></A>This was why I cut off my silvered locks and let them fall for grief with 
<A NAME="297"></A>many a tear, not clad in robes of white, my son, but instead thereof taking

<A NAME="548"></A>thy brother's cause prevail, how shalt thou return to Argos, leaving countless 
<A NAME="549"></A>dead behind? Some one will be sure to say, "Out on thee! Adrastus, for

<A NAME="832"></A>As for my sire he hath been guilty of folly against himself in putting

<A NAME="834"></A>slay us too. One thing only have we still to do, to ask Teiresias, the

<A NAME="836"></A>bears thy father's name, will I send to fetch Teiresias hither, Creon; 
<A NAME="837"></A>for with the he will readily converse, though I have ere now so scorned 
<A NAME="838"></A>his art prophetic to his face, that he has reasons to reproach me. This 
<A NAME="839"></A>commandment, Creon, I lay upon the city and thee; should my cause prevail, 
<A NAME="840"></A>never give Polyneices' corpse a grave in Theban soil, and if so be some 
<A NAME="841"></A>friend should bury him, let death reward the man. Thus far to thee; and 
<A NAME="842"></A>to my servants thus, bring forth my arms and coat of mail, that I may start 
<A NAME="843"></A>at once for the appointed combat, with right to lead to victory. To save

<A NAME="849"></A>O Ares, god of toil and trouble! why, why art thou possessed by love of 
<A NAME="850"></A>blood and death, out of harmony with the festivals of Bromius? 'Tis for 
<A NAME="851"></A>no crowns of dancers fair that thou dost toss thy youthful curls to the 
<A NAME="852"></A>breeze, singing the while to the lute's soft breath a strain to charm the 
<A NAME="853"></A>dancers' feet; but with warriors clad in mail thou dost lead thy sombre 
<A NAME="854"></A>revelry, breathing into Argive breasts lust for Theban blood; with no wild 
<A NAME="855"></A>waving of the thyrsus, clad in fawnskin thou dancest, but with chariots 
<A NAME="856"></A>and bitted steeds wheelest thy charger strong of hoof. O'er the waters 
<A NAME="857"></A>of Ismenus in wild career thou art urging thy horses, inspiring Argive 
<A NAME="858"></A>breasts with hate of the earth-born race, arraying in brazen harness against 
<A NAME="859"></A>these stone-built walls a host of warriors armed with shields. Truly Strife 
<A NAME="860"></A>is a goddess to fear, who devised these troubles for the princes of this

<A NAME="862"></A>O Cithaeron, apple of the eye of Artemis, holy vale of leaves, amid whose 
<A NAME="863"></A>snows full many a beast lies couched, would thou hadst never reared the 
<A NAME="864"></A>child exposed to die, Oedipus the fruit of Jocasta's womb, when as a babe 
<A NAME="865"></A>he was cast forth from his home, marked with golden brooch; and would the 
<A NAME="866"></A>Sphinx, that winged maid, fell monster from the hills, had never come to 
<A NAME="867"></A>curse our land with inharmonious strains; she that erst drew nigh our walls 
<A NAME="868"></A>and snatched the sons of Cadmus away in her taloned feet to the pathless 
<A NAME="869"></A>fields of light, a fiend sent by Hades from hell to plague the men of Thebes; 
<A NAME="870"></A>once more unhappy strife is bursting out between the sons of Oedipus in 
<A NAME="871"></A>city and home. For never can wrong be right, nor children of unnatural 
<A NAME="872"></A>parentage come as a glory to the mother that bears them, but as a stain

<A NAME="877"></A>crest, that fed on beasts, to be the glory and reproach of Thebes. In days 
<A NAME="878"></A>gone by the sons of heaven came to the wedding of Harmonia, and the walls

<A NAME="920"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>For Eteocles I would have closed my lips and refrained from 
<A NAME="921"></A>all response, but to thee I will speak, since 'tis thy wish to learn. This 
<A NAME="922"></A>country, Creon, has been long afflicted, ever since Laius became a father 
<A NAME="923"></A>in heaven's despite, begetting hapless Oedipus to be his own mother's husband. 
<A NAME="924"></A>That bloody outrage on his eyes was planned by heaven as an ensample to 
<A NAME="925"></A>Hellas; and the sons of Oedipus made a gross mistake in wishing to throw 
<A NAME="926"></A>over it the veil of time, as if forsooth they could outrun the gods' decree; 
<A NAME="927"></A>for by robbing their father of his due honour and allowing him no freedom, 
<A NAME="928"></A>they enraged their luckless sire; so he, stung by suffering and disgrace 
<A NAME="929"></A>as well, vented awful curses against them; and I, because I left nothing 
<A NAME="930"></A>undone or unsaid to prevent this, incurred the hatred of the sons of Oedipus. 
<A NAME="931"></A>But death inflicted by each other's hands awaits them, Creon; and the many 
<A NAME="932"></A>heaps of slain, some from Argive, some from Theban missiles, shall cause 
<A NAME="933"></A>bitter lamentation in the land of Thebes. Alas! for thee, poor city, thou 
<A NAME="934"></A>art being involved in their ruin, unless I can persuade one man. The best 
<A NAME="935"></A>course was to prevent any child of Oedipus becoming either citizen or king 
<A NAME="936"></A>in this land, since they were under a ban and would overthrow the city. 
<A NAME="937"></A>But as evil has the mastery of good, there is still one other way of safety;

<A NAME="1115"></A>this land of Thebes, a joy to them then but afterwards cause of grief; 
<A NAME="1116"></A>for, when he had read the riddle triumphantly, he formed with his mother 
<A NAME="1117"></A>an unhallowed union, woe to him! polluting the city; and by his curses, 
<A NAME="1118"></A>luckless wight, he plunged his sons into a guilty strife, causing them 
<A NAME="1119"></A>to wade through seas of blood. All reverence do we feel for him, who is 
<A NAME="1120"></A>gone to his death in his country's cause, bequeathing to Creon a legacy 
<A NAME="1121"></A>of tears, but destined to crown with victory our seven fenced towers. May 
<A NAME="1122"></A>our motherhood be blessed with such noble sons, O Pallas, kindly queen, 
<A NAME="1123"></A>who with well-aimed stone didst spill the serpent's blood, rousing Cadmus 
<A NAME="1124"></A>as thou didst to brood upon the task, whereof the issue was a demon's curse 
<A NAME="1125"></A>that swooped upon this land and harried it. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="1158"></A><B>MESSENGER</B>
<A NAME="1159"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>After Creon's son, who gave up life for country, had taken 
<A NAME="1160"></A>his stand on the turret's top and plunged a sword dark-hilted through his 
<A NAME="1161"></A>throat to save this land, thy son told off seven companies with their captains 
<A NAME="1162"></A>to the seven gates to keep watch on the Argive warriors, and stationed 
<A NAME="1163"></A>cavalry to cover cavalry, and infantry to support infantry, that assistance 
<A NAME="1164"></A>might be close at hand for any weak point in the walls. Then from our lofty 
<A NAME="1165"></A>towers we saw the Argive host with their white shields leaving Teumessus, 
<A NAME="1166"></A>and, when near the trench, they charged up to our Theban city at the double. 
<A NAME="1167"></A>In one loud burst from their ranks and from our battlements rang out the 
<A NAME="1168"></A>battle-cry and trumpet-call. First to the Neistian gate, Parthenopaeus, 
<A NAME="1169"></A>son of the huntress maid, led a company bristling with serried shields, 
<A NAME="1170"></A>himself with his own peculiar badge in the centre of his targe, Atalanta 
<A NAME="1171"></A>slaying the Aetolian boar with an arrow shot from far. To the gates of 
<A NAME="1172"></A>Proetus came the prophet Amphiaraus, bringing the victims on a chariot; 
<A NAME="1173"></A>no vaunting blazon he carried, but weapons chastely plain. Next, prince 
<A NAME="1174"></A>Hippomedon came marching to the Ogygian port with this device upon his 
<A NAME="1175"></A>boss, Argus the all-seeing with his spangled eyes upon the watch whereof 
<A NAME="1176"></A>some open with the rising stars, while others he closes when they set, 
<A NAME="1177"></A>as one could see after he was slain. At the Homoloian gates Tydeus was 
<A NAME="1178"></A>posting himself, a lion's skin with shaggy mane upon his buckler, while 
<A NAME="1179"></A>in his right hand he bore a torch, like Titan Prometheus, to fire the town. 
<A NAME="1180"></A>Thy own son Polyneices led the battle 'gainst the Fountain gate; upon his 
<A NAME="1181"></A>shield for blazon were the steeds of Potniae galloping at frantic speed, 
<A NAME="1182"></A>revolving by some clever contrivance on pivots inside the buckler close 
<A NAME="1183"></A>to the handle, so as to appear distraught. At Electra's gate famed Capaneus 
<A NAME="1184"></A>brought up his company, bold as Ares for the fray; this device his buckler 
<A NAME="1185"></A>bore upon its iron back, an earth-born giant carrying on his shoulders 
<A NAME="1186"></A>a whole city which he had wrenched from its base, hint to us of the fate 
<A NAME="1187"></A>in store for Thebes. Adrastus was stationed at the seventh gate; a hundred 
<A NAME="1188"></A>vipers filled his shield with graven work, as he bore on his left arm that 
<A NAME="1189"></A>proud Argive badge, the hydra, and serpents were carrying off in their 
<A NAME="1190"></A>jaws the sons of Thebes from within their very walls. Now I was enabled 
<A NAME="1191"></A>to see each of them, as I carried the watch-word along the line to the 
<A NAME="1192"></A>leaders of our companies. To begin with, we fought with bows and thonged 
<A NAME="1193"></A>javelins, with slings that shoot from far and showers of crashing stones; 
<A NAME="1194"></A>and as we were conquering, Tydeus and thy son on sudden cried aloud, "Ye 
<A NAME="1195"></A>sons of Argos, before being riddled by their fire, why delay to fall upon 
<A NAME="1196"></A>the gates with might and main, the whole of you, light-armed and horse 
<A NAME="1197"></A>and charioteers?" No loitering then, soon as they heard that call; and 
<A NAME="1198"></A>many a warrior fell with bloody crown, and not a few of us thou couldst 
<A NAME="1199"></A>have seen thrown to the earth like tumblers before the walls, after they 
<A NAME="1200"></A>had given up the ghost, bedewing the thirsty ground with streams of gore. 
<A NAME="1201"></A>Then Atalanta's son, who was not an Argive but an Arcadian, hurling himself 
<A NAME="1202"></A>like a hurricane at the gates, called for fire and picks to raze the town; 
<A NAME="1203"></A>but Periclymenus, son of the ocean-god, stayed his wild career, heaving 
<A NAME="1204"></A>on his head a waggon-load of stone, even the coping torn from the battlements; 
<A NAME="1205"></A>and it shattered his head with the hair and crashed through the sutures 
<A NAME="1206"></A>of the skull, dabbling with blood his cheek just showing manhood's flush; 
<A NAME="1207"></A>and never shall he go back alive to his fair archer-mother, the maid of 
<A NAME="1208"></A>Maenalus.
<A NAME="1209"></A><BR><BR>Thy son then, seeing these gates secure, went on to the next, and 
<A NAME="1210"></A>I with him. There I saw Tydeus and his serried ranks of targeteers hurling 
<A NAME="1211"></A>their Aetolian spears into the opening at the top of the turrets, with 
<A NAME="1212"></A>such good aim that our men fled and left the beetling battlements: but 
<A NAME="1213"></A>thy son rallied them once more, as a huntsman cheers his hounds, and made 
<A NAME="1214"></A>them man the towers again. And then away we hastened to other gates, after 
<A NAME="1215"></A>stopping the panic there. As for the madness of Capaneus, how am I to describe 
<A NAME="1216"></A>it? There was he, carrying with him a long scaling-ladder and loudly boasting 
<A NAME="1217"></A>that even the awful lightning of Zeus would not stay him from giving the 
<A NAME="1218"></A>city to utter destruction; and even as he spoke, he crept up beneath the 
<A NAME="1219"></A>hail of stones, gathered under the shelter of his shield, mounting from 
<A NAME="1220"></A>rung to rung on the smooth ladder; but, just as he was scaling the parapet 
<A NAME="1221"></A>of the wall, Zeus smote him with a thunderbolt; loud the earth re-echoed, 
<A NAME="1222"></A>and fear seized every heart; for his limbs were hurled from the ladder 
<A NAME="1223"></A>far apart as from a sling, his head toward the sky, his blood toward earth, 
<A NAME="1224"></A>while his legs and arms went spinning round like Ixion's wheel, till his 
<A NAME="1225"></A>charred corpse fell to the ground. But when Adrastus saw that Zeus was 
<A NAME="1226"></A>leagued against his army, he drew the Argive troops outside the trench 
<A NAME="1227"></A>and halted them. Meantime our horse, marking the lucky omen of Zeus, began 
<A NAME="1228"></A>driving forth their chariots, and our men-at-arms charged into the thick 
<A NAME="1229"></A>of the Argives, and everything combined to their discomfiture; men were 
<A NAME="1230"></A>falling and hurled headlong from chariots, wheels flew off, axles crashed 
<A NAME="1231"></A>together, while ever higher grew the heaps of slain; so for to-day at least 
<A NAME="1232"></A>have we prevented the destruction of our country's bulwarks; but whether 
<A NAME="1233"></A>fortune will hereafter smile upon this land, that rests with Heaven; for, 
<A NAME="1234"></A>even as it is, it owes its safety to some deity.
<A NAME="1235"></A><BR><BR>Victory is fair; and if the gods are growing kinder, it would be 
<A NAME="1236"></A>well with me. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
