<A NAME="19"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>To Hector's couch away, one of you wakeful squires that tend 
<A NAME="20"></A>the prince, to see if he have any fresh tidings from the warriors who were 
<A NAME="21"></A>set to guard the assembled host during the fourth watch of the night. 
<A NAME="22"></A> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="23"></A><I>Calls to HECTOR in the tent</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="24"></A>Lift up thy head! Prop thine arm beneath it! Unseal that louring eye from 
<A NAME="25"></A>its repose; thy lowly couch of scattered leaves, O Hector, quit! 'Tis time 
<A NAME="26"></A>to hearken. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="27"></A><I>Enter HECTOR.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="28"></A><B>HECTOR</B>
<A NAME="29"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Who goes there? Is it a friend who calls? Who art thou? Thy 
<A NAME="30"></A>watchword? Speak! Who in the dark hours comes nigh my couch, must tell 
<A NAME="31"></A>me who he is. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="32"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="33"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Sentinels we of the army. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="34"></A><B>HECTOR</B>
<A NAME="35"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Why this tumultuous haste? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="36"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="37"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Be of good courage. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="38"></A><B>HECTOR</B>
<A NAME="39"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Is there some midnight ambuscade? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="40"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="41"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Nay. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="42"></A><B>HECTOR</B>
<A NAME="43"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Then why dost thou desert thy post and rouse the army, save 
<A NAME="44"></A>thou have some tidings of the night? Art not aware how near the Argive 
<A NAME="45"></A>host we take our night's repose in all our harness clad? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="46"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="47"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>To arms! O Hector, seek thine allies' sleeping camp! Bid them 
<A NAME="48"></A>wield the spear! Awake them! thine own company despatch a friend. Saddle 
<A NAME="49"></A>and bridle the steeds. Who will to the son of Panthus? who to Europa's 
<A NAME="50"></A>son, captain of the Lycian band? Where are they who should inspect the 
<A NAME="51"></A>victims? Where be the leaders of the light-armed troops? Ye Phrygian archers, 
<A NAME="52"></A>string your horn-tipped bows. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="53"></A><B>HECTOR</B>
<A NAME="54"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Now fear, now confidence thy tidings inspire; nothing is plainly 
<A NAME="55"></A>set forth. Can it be that thou art smitten with wild affright by Pan, the 
<A NAME="56"></A>son of Cronion, and leaving thy watch therefore dost rouse the host? What 
<A NAME="57"></A>means thy noisy summons? What tidings can I say thou bringest? Thy words 
<A NAME="58"></A>are many, but no plain statement hast thou made. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="59"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="60"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>The long night through, O Hector, the Argive host hath kindled 
<A NAME="61"></A>fires, and bright with torches shines the anchored fleet. To Agamemnon's 
<A NAME="62"></A>tent the whole army moves clamorously by night, eager for fresh orders 
<A NAME="63"></A>maybe, for never before have I seen such commotion among yon sea-faring 
<A NAME="64"></A>folk. Wherefore I was suspicious of what might happen and came to tell 
<A NAME="65"></A>thee, that thou mayest have no cause to blame me hereafter. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="66"></A><B>HECTOR</B>
<A NAME="67"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>In good season com'st thou, albeit thy tidings are fraught 
<A NAME="68"></A>with terror; for those cowards are bent on giving me the slip and stealing 
<A NAME="69"></A>away from this land in their ships by night; their midnight signalling 
<A NAME="70"></A>convinces me of this. Ah! Fortune, to rob me in my hour of triumph, a lion 
<A NAME="71"></A>of his prey, or ever this spear of mine with one fell swoop had made an 
<A NAME="72"></A>end for aye of yonder Argive host! Yea, had not the sun's bright lamp withheld 
<A NAME="73"></A>his light, I had not stayed my victor's spear, ere I had fired their ships 
<A NAME="74"></A>and made my way from tent to tent, drenching this hand in Achaean gore. 
<A NAME="75"></A>Right eager was I to make a night attack and take advantage of the stroke 
<A NAME="76"></A>of luck by heaven sent, but those wise seers of mine, who have heaven's 
<A NAME="77"></A>will so pat, persuaded me to wait the dawn, and then leave not one Achaean 
<A NAME="78"></A>in the land. But those others await not the counsels of my soothsayers; 
<A NAME="79"></A>darkness turns runaways to heroes. Needs must we now without delay pass 
<A NAME="80"></A>this word along the line "Arm, arm! from slumber cease!" for many a man 
<A NAME="81"></A>of them, e'en as he leaps aboard his ship, shall be smitten through the 
<A NAME="82"></A>back and sprinkle the ladders with blood, and others shall be fast bound 
<A NAME="83"></A>with cords and learn to till our Phrygian glebe. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="84"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="85"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Thou hastest, Hector, before thou knowest clearly what is happening; 
<A NAME="86"></A>for we do not know for certain whether our foes are flying. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="87"></A><B>HECTOR</B>
<A NAME="88"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What reason else had the Argive host to kindle fires? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="89"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="90"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I cannot say; my soul doth much misgive me. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="91"></A><B>HECTOR</B>
<A NAME="92"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>If this thou fearest, be sure there's nought thou wouldst not 
<A NAME="93"></A>fear. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="94"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="95"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Never aforetime did the enemy kindle such a blaze. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="96"></A><B>HECTOR</B>
<A NAME="97"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No, nor ever before did they suffer such shameful defeat and 
<A NAME="98"></A>rout. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="99"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="100"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>This thou didst achieve; look now to what remains to do. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="101"></A><B>HECTOR</B>
<A NAME="102"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I have but one word to say, "Arm, arm against the foe!" 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="103"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="104"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Lo! where Aeneas comes, in hot haste too, as though he hath 
<A NAME="105"></A>news to tell his friends. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="106"></A><I>Enter ENEAS.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="107"></A><B>AENEAS</B>
<A NAME="108"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Why, Hector, have the sentinels in terror made their way through 
<A NAME="109"></A>the host to thy couch to hold a midnight conclave and disturb the army? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="110"></A><B>HECTOR</B>
<A NAME="111"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Case thee in thy coat of mail, Aeneas. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="112"></A><B>AENEAS</B>
<A NAME="113"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>How now? are tidings come of some secret stratagem set on foot 
<A NAME="114"></A>during the night by the foe? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="115"></A><B>HECTOR</B>
<A NAME="116"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>They are flying, these foes of ours, and going aboard their 
<A NAME="117"></A>ships. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="118"></A><B>AENEAS</B>
<A NAME="119"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What sure proof canst thou give of this? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="120"></A><B>HECTOR</B>
<A NAME="121"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>The livelong night they are kindling blazing torches; methinks 
<A NAME="122"></A>they will not wait for the morrow, but after lighting brands upon their 
<A NAME="123"></A>ships' decks will leave this and to their homes. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="124"></A><B>AENEAS</B>
<A NAME="125"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And thou, wherefore dost thou gird thee with thy sword? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="126"></A><B>HECTOR</B>
<A NAME="127"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>With my spear will I stop them even as they fly and leap aboard 
<A NAME="128"></A>their ships, and my hand shail be heavy upon them; for shameful it were 
<A NAME="129"></A>in us, aye, and cowardly as well as shameful, when God gives them into 
<A NAME="130"></A>our hands, to let our foes escape without a blow after all the injuries 
<A NAME="131"></A>they have done us. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="132"></A><B>AENEAS</B>
<A NAME="133"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Would thou wert as sage as thou art bold But lo! among mortals 
<A NAME="134"></A>the same man is not dowered by nature with universal knowledge; each hath 
<A NAME="135"></A>his special gift appointed him, thine is arms, another's is sage counsel. 
<A NAME="136"></A>Thou hearest their torches are blazing, and art fired with the hope that 
<A NAME="137"></A>the Achaeans are flying, and wouldst lead on our troops across the trenches 
<A NAME="138"></A>in the calm still night. Now after crossing the deep yawning trench, supposing 
<A NAME="139"></A>thou shouldst find the enemy are not flying from the land, but are awaiting 
<A NAME="140"></A>thy onset, beware lest thou suffer defeat and so never reach this city 
<A NAME="141"></A>again; for how wilt thou pass the palisades in a rout? And how shall thy 
<A NAME="142"></A>charioteers cross the bridges without dashing the axles of their cars to 
<A NAME="143"></A>pieces? And, if victorious, thou hast next the son of Peleus to engage; 
<A NAME="144"></A>he will ne'er suffer thee to cast the firebrand on the fleet, no, nor to 
<A NAME="145"></A>harry the Achaeans as thou dost fondly fancy. Nay, for yon man is fierce 
<A NAME="146"></A>as fire, a very tower of valiancy. Let us rather then leave our men to 
<A NAME="147"></A>sleep calmly under arms after the weariness of battle, while we send, as 
<A NAME="148"></A>I advise, whoe'er will volunteer, to spy upon the enemy; and if they really 
<A NAME="149"></A>are preparing to fly, let us arise and fall upon the Argive host, but if 
<A NAME="150"></A>this signalling is a trap to catch us, we shall discover from the spy the 
<A NAME="151"></A>enemy's designs and take our measures; such is my advice, O King. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="152"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="153"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>It likes me well; so change thy mind and adopt this counsel. 
<A NAME="154"></A>I love not hazardous commands in generals. What better scheme could be 
<A NAME="155"></A>than for a fleet spy to approach the ships and learn why our foes are lighting 
<A NAME="156"></A>fires in front of their naval station? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="157"></A><B>HECTOR</B>
<A NAME="158"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Since this finds favour with you all, prevail. 
<A NAME="159"></A> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="160"></A><I>To AENEAS</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="161"></A>Go thou and marshal our allies; mayhap the host hearing of our midnight 
<A NAME="162"></A>council is disturbed. Mine shall it be to send one forth to spy upon the 
<A NAME="163"></A>foe. And if I discover any plot amongst them, thou shalt fully hear thereof, 
<A NAME="164"></A>and at the council-board shalt learn our will; but in case they be starting 
<A NAME="165"></A>off in flight, with cager ear await the trumpet's call, for then I will 
<A NAME="166"></A>not stay, but will this very night engage the Argive host there where their 
<A NAME="167"></A>ships are hauled up. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="168"></A><B>AENEAS</B>
<A NAME="169"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Send out the spy forthwith; there's safety in thy counsels 
<A NAME="170"></A>now. And thou shalt find me steadfast at thy side, whene'er occasion call. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="171"></A><I>Exit AENEAS.</I>

<A NAME="172"></A><B>HECTOR</B>
<A NAME="173"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What Trojan now af all our company doth volunteer to go and 
<A NAME="174"></A>spy the Argive fleet? Who will be that patriot? Who saith "I will"? Myself 
<A NAME="175"></A>cannot at every point serve my country and my friends in arms.

<A NAME="177"></A><I>Comes from the rear</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="178"></A>I for my country will gladly run this risk and go to spy the Argive fleet,

<A NAME="181"></A><B>HECTOR</B>
<A NAME="182"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>True to his name in sooth, his country's friend is Dolon. Thy

<A NAME="427"></A>thrown by hostile Argive spears. Thou canst not say 'twas any want of invitation

<A NAME="434"></A>fell upon the Thracian chieftains face to face around Pangaeus in Paeonia's

<A NAME="440"></A>cairn, no mean proof of loyalty to the city, and others in harness clad

<A NAME="450"></A>Scythian folk, whose borders march with mine, made war on me on the very 
<A NAME="451"></A>eve of my departure for Ilium; already had I reached the strand of the 
<A NAME="452"></A>Euxine sea, there to transport my Thracian army. Then did my spear pour 
<A NAME="453"></A>out o'er Scythia's soil great drops of bloody rain, and Thrace too shared 
<A NAME="454"></A>in the mingled slaughter. This then was what did chance to keep me from 
<A NAME="455"></A>coming to the land of Troy and joining thy standard. But soon as I had 
<A NAME="456"></A>conquered these and taken their children as hostages and appointed the 
<A NAME="457"></A>yearly tribute they should pay my house, I crossed the firth, and lo! am

<A NAME="826"></A>not in array, nor were the whips hung ready on the horses' yokes, for our 
<A NAME="827"></A>prince was told that you were masters now, and had encamped hard on their

<A NAME="829"></A>awoke from my slumber, and with ungrudging hand did measure out the horses' 
<A NAME="830"></A>feed, expecting to harness them at dawn unto the fray; when lo! through

<A NAME="833"></A>to keep away from our army, for I thought they might be thieves from our 
<A NAME="834"></A>allies. No answer made they, so I too said no more, but came back to my 
<A NAME="835"></A>couch and slept again. And lo! as I slept came a strange fancy o'er me: 
<A NAME="836"></A>I saw, methought as in a dream, those steeds that I had groomed and used 
<A NAME="837"></A>to drive, stationed at Rhesus' side, with wolves mounted on their backs; 
<A NAME="838"></A>and these with their tails did lash the horses' flanks and urge them on, 
<A NAME="839"></A>while they did snort and breathe fury from their nostrils, striving in 
<A NAME="840"></A>terror to unseat their riders. Up I sprang to defend the horses from the 
<A NAME="841"></A>brutes, for the horror of the night scared me. Then as I raised my head 
<A NAME="842"></A>I heard the groans of dying men, and a warm stream of new-shed blood bespattered 
<A NAME="843"></A>me where I lay close to my murdered master as he gave up the ghost. To 
<A NAME="844"></A>my feet I start, but all unarmed; and as I peer about and grope to find 
<A NAME="845"></A>my sword, a stalwart hand from somewhere nigh dealt me a sword-thrust beneath 
<A NAME="846"></A>the ribs. I know the sword that dealt that blow from the deep gaping wound 
<A NAME="847"></A>it gave me. Down on my face I fell, while they fled clean away with steeds 
<A NAME="848"></A>and chariot. Alack, alack! Tortured with pain, too weak to stand, a piteous 
<A NAME="849"></A>object I know what happened, for I saw it; but how the victims met their 
<A NAME="850"></A>death I cannot say, nor whose the hand that smote them; but I can well 
<A NAME="851"></A>surmise we have our friends to thank for this mischance.

<A NAME="860"></A>through the host, and you drove them not away as they passed in or out? 
<A NAME="861"></A>Who but you shall pay the penalty for this? You, I say, were stationed 
<A NAME="862"></A>here to the host. But they are gone without a wound, with many a scoff 
<A NAME="863"></A>at Phrygian cowardice, and at me their leader. Now mark ye this-by father 
<A NAME="864"></A>Zeus I swear at least the scourge, if not the headsman's axe, awaits such

<A NAME="868"></A>see, great lord of my city, in the hour that I brought my news to thee 
<A NAME="869"></A>that the Argive host was kindling fires about the ships; for by the springs 
<A NAME="870"></A>of Simois I vow my eye kept sleepless watch by night, nor did I slumber 
<A NAME="871"></A>or sleep. O be not angered with me, my lord; I am guiltless of all; yet 
<A NAME="872"></A>if hereafter thou find that I in word or deed have done amiss, bury me

<A NAME="875"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Why threaten these? Why try to undermine my poor barbarian 
<A NAME="876"></A>wit by crafty words, barbarian thou thyself? Thou didst this deed; nor 
<A NAME="877"></A>they who have suffered ail, nor we by wounds disabled will believe it was 
<A NAME="878"></A>any other. A long and subtle speech thou'lt need to prove to me thou didst 
<A NAME="879"></A>not slay thy friends because thou didst covet the horses, and to gain them 
<A NAME="880"></A>didst murder thine own allies, after bidding them come so straitly. They 
<A NAME="881"></A>came, and they are dead. Why, Paris found more decent means to shame the 
<A NAME="882"></A>rights of hospitality than thou, with thy slaughter of thy allies. Never 
<A NAME="883"></A>tell me some Argive came and slaughtered us. Who could have passed the 
<A NAME="884"></A>Trojan lines and come against us without detection? Thou and thy Phrygian 
<A NAME="885"></A>troops were camped in front of us. Who was wounded, who was slain amongst 
<A NAME="886"></A>thy friends, when that foe thou speak'st of came? 'Twas we were wounded, 
<A NAME="887"></A>while some have met a sterner fate and said farewell to heaven's light. 
<A NAME="888"></A>Briefly, then, no Achaean do I blame. For what enemy could have come and 
<A NAME="889"></A>found the lowly bed of Rhesus in the dark, unless some deity were guiding 
<A NAME="890"></A>the murderers' steps? They did not so much as know of his arrival. No,

<A NAME="948"></A>that left her home in Hellas, and sailed hither with her Phrygian paramour, 
<A NAME="949"></A>bringing death to thee, my dearest son, 'neath Ilium's walls, and stripping 
<A NAME="950"></A>countless cities of their heroes brave. Deep, deep the wounds, son of Philammon, 
<A NAME="951"></A>hast thou inflicted on my heart, in life, nor less in Hades' halls. Yea, 
<A NAME="952"></A>for 'twas thy pride, thy own undoing, and thy rivalry with us Muses that 
<A NAME="953"></A>made me mother of this poor son of mine. For as I crossed the river's streams 
<A NAME="954"></A>I came too nigh to Strymon's fruitful couch, that day we Muses came unto 
<A NAME="955"></A>the brow of Mount Pangaeus with its soil of gold, with all our music furnished 
<A NAME="956"></A>forth for one great trial of minstrel skill with that clever Thracian bard, 
<A NAME="957"></A>and him we reft of sight, even Thamyris, the man who oft reviled our craft. 
<A NAME="958"></A>Anon, when I gave birth to thee, because I felt shame of my sisters and 
<A NAME="959"></A>my maiden years, I sent thee to the swirling stream of thy sire, the water-god; 
<A NAME="960"></A>and Strymon did not entrust thy nurture to mortal hands, but to the fountain 
<A NAME="961"></A>nymphs. There wert thou reared most fairly by the maiden nymphs, and didst 
<A NAME="962"></A>rule o'er Thrace, a leader amongst men, my child. So long as thou didst 
<A NAME="963"></A>range thy native land in quest of bloody deeds of prowess I feared not 
<A NAME="964"></A>for thy death, but I bade thee ne'er set out for Troy-town, for well I 
<A NAME="965"></A>knew thy doom; but Hector's messages and those countless embassies urged 
<A NAME="966"></A>thee to go and help thy friends. This was thy doing, Athena; thou alone 
<A NAME="967"></A>art to blame for his death (neither Odysseus nor the son of Tydeus had 
<A NAME="968"></A>aught to do with it); think not it hath escaped mine eye. And yet we sister 
<A NAME="969"></A>Muses do special honour to thy city, thy land we chiefly haunt; yea, and 
<A NAME="970"></A>Orpheus, own cousin of the dead whom thou hast slain, did for thee unfold 
<A NAME="971"></A>those dark mysteries with their torch processions. Musaeus, too, thy holy 
<A NAME="972"></A>citizen, of all men most advanced in lore, him did Phoebus with us sisters 
<A NAME="973"></A>train. And here is my reward for this; dead in my arms I hold my child 
<A NAME="974"></A>and mourn for him. Henceforth no other learned man I'll bring to thee.
