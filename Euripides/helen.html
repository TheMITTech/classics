<A NAME="23"></A><B>HELEN</B>
<A NAME="24"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Lo! These are the fair virgin streams of Nile, the river that 
<A NAME="25"></A>waters Egypt's tilth, fed by pure melting snow instead of rain from heaven. 
<A NAME="26"></A>Proteus during his life-time was king of this land, dwelling in the isle 
<A NAME="27"></A>of Pharos, and ruling o'er Egypt; and he took to wife one of the daughters 
<A NAME="28"></A>of the sea, Psamathe, after she left the embraces of Aeacus. Two children 
<A NAME="29"></A>she bare in this his palace, a son Theoclymenus, who hath passed his life 
<A NAME="30"></A>in duteous service to the gods, and likewise a noble daughter, her mother's 
<A NAME="31"></A>pride, called Eido in her infancy, but when she reached her youthful prime, 
<A NAME="32"></A>the age for wedded joys, renamed Theonoe; for well she knew whate'er the 
<A NAME="33"></A>gods design, both present and to come, for she had won this guerdon from 
<A NAME="34"></A>her grandsire Nereus. Nor is my fatherland unknown to fame, e'en Sparta, 
<A NAME="35"></A>or my sire Tyndareus; for a legend tells how Zeus winged his way to my 
<A NAME="36"></A>mother Leda's breast, in the semblance of a bird, even a swan, and thus 
<A NAME="37"></A>as he fled from an eagle's pursuit, achieved by guile his amorous purpose, 
<A NAME="38"></A>if this tale be true. My name is Helen, and I will now recount the sorrows 
<A NAME="39"></A>I have suffered. To a hollow vale on Ida came three goddesses to Paris, 
<A NAME="40"></A>for beauty's prize contending, Hera and Cypris, and the virgin child of 
<A NAME="41"></A>Zeus, eager to secure his verdict on their loveliness. Now Cypris held 
<A NAME="42"></A>out my beauty,-if aught so wretched deserves that name,-as a bride before 
<A NAME="43"></A>the eyes of Paris, saying he should marry me; and so she won the day; wherefore 
<A NAME="44"></A>the shepherd of Ida left his steading, and came to Sparta, thinking to 
<A NAME="45"></A>win me for his bride. But Hera, indignant at not defeating the goddesses, 
<A NAME="46"></A>brought to naught my marriage with Paris, and gave to Priam's princely 
<A NAME="47"></A>son not Helen, but a phantom endowed with life, that she made in my image 
<A NAME="48"></A>out of the breath of heaven; and Paris thought that I was his, although 
<A NAME="49"></A>I never was,-an idle fancy! Moreover, the counsels of Zeus added further 
<A NAME="50"></A>troubles unto these; for upon the land of Hellas and the hapless Phrygians 
<A NAME="51"></A>he brought a war, that he might lighten mother-earth of her myriad hosts 
<A NAME="52"></A>of men, and to the bravest of the sons of Hellas bring renown. So I was 
<A NAME="53"></A>set up as a prize for all the chivalry of Hellas, to test the might of 
<A NAME="54"></A>Phrygia, yet not I, but my name alone; for Hermes caught me up in the embracing 
<A NAME="55"></A>air, and veiled me in a cloud; for Zeus was not unmindful of me; and he 
<A NAME="56"></A>set me down here in the house of Proteus, judging him to be the most virtuous 
<A NAME="57"></A>of all mankind; that so I might preserve my marriage with Menelaus free 
<A NAME="58"></A>from taint. Here then I abide, while my hapless lord has gathered an army, 
<A NAME="59"></A>and is setting out for the towers of Ilium to track and recover me. And 
<A NAME="60"></A>there by Scamander's streams hath many a life breathed out its last, and 
<A NAME="61"></A>all for me; and I, that have endured all this, am accursed, and seem to 
<A NAME="62"></A>have embroiled all Hellas in a mighty war by proving a traitress to my 
<A NAME="63"></A>husband. Why, then, do I prolong my life? Because I heard Hermes declare, 
<A NAME="64"></A>that I should yet again make my home on Sparta's glorious soil, with my 
<A NAME="65"></A>lord,-for Hermes knew I never went to Ilium,-that so I might never submit 
<A NAME="66"></A>to any other's wooing. Now as long as Proteus gazed upon yon glorious sun, 
<A NAME="67"></A>I was safe from marriage; but when o'er him the dark grave closed, the 
<A NAME="68"></A>dead man's son was eager for my hand. But I, from regard to my former husband, 
<A NAME="69"></A>am throwing myself down in suppliant wise before this tomb of Proteus, 
<A NAME="70"></A>praying him to guard my husband's honour, that, though through Hellas I 
<A NAME="71"></A>bear a name dishonoured, at least my body here may not incur disgrace.

<A NAME="74"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Who is lord and master of this fenced palace? The house is 
<A NAME="75"></A>one I may compare to the halls of Plutus, with its royal bulwarks and towering 
<A NAME="76"></A>buildings. Ha! great gods! what sight is here? I see the counterfeit of 
<A NAME="77"></A>that fell murderous dame, who ruined me and all the Achaeans. May Heaven 
<A NAME="78"></A>show its loathing for thee, so much dost thou resemble Helen! Were I not 
<A NAME="79"></A>standing on a foreign soil, with this well-aimed shaft had worked thy death, 
<A NAME="80"></A>thy reward for resembling the daughter of Zeus. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="81"></A><B>HELEN</B>

<A NAME="84"></A><B>TEUCER</B>
<A NAME="85"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I was wrong; I yielded to my anger more than I ought; my reason

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="130"></A><B>TEUCER</B>
<A NAME="131"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Yes, because I did not join him in his death. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="132"></A><B>HELEN</B>
<A NAME="133"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>So thou camest, sir stranger, to Ilium's famous town? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="134"></A><B>TEUCER</B>
<A NAME="135"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Aye, and, after helping to sack it, myself did learn what ruin

<A NAME="216"></A>my griefs. The reason of my coming to this royal palace was a wish to see 
<A NAME="217"></A>that famous prophetess Theonoe. Do thou the means afford, that I from her 
<A NAME="218"></A>may obtain an oracle how I shall steer a favourable course to the sea-girt 
<A NAME="219"></A>shores of Cyprus; for there Apollo hath declared my home shall be, giving

<A NAME="225"></A>land, catch sight of thee. Now is he away with his trusty hounds tracking 
<A NAME="226"></A>his savage quarry to the death; for every stranger that he catcheth from

<A NAME="291"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Good friends, to what a fate am I united? Did not my mother 
<A NAME="292"></A>bear me to be a monster to the world? For no woman, Hellene or barbarian, 
<A NAME="293"></A>gives birth to babes in eggs inclosed, as they say Leda bare me to Zeus. 
<A NAME="294"></A>My life and all I do is one miracle, partly owing to Hera, and partly is 
<A NAME="295"></A>my beauty to blame. Would God I could rub my beauty out like a picture, 
<A NAME="296"></A>and assume hereafter in its stead a form less comely, and oh! that Hellas 
<A NAME="297"></A>had forgotten the evil fate that now I bear, and were now remembering my 
<A NAME="298"></A>career of honour as surely as they do my deeds of shame. Now, if a man 
<A NAME="299"></A>doth turn his eyes to a single phase of fortune, and meets ill-usage at 
<A NAME="300"></A>heaven's hands, 'tis hard no doubt; but still it can be borne; but I in 
<A NAME="301"></A>countless troubles am involved. First, although I never sinned, my good 
<A NAME="302"></A>name is gone. And this is a grief beyond the reality, if a man incurs blame 
<A NAME="303"></A>for sins that are not his. Next, have the gods removed me from my native 
<A NAME="304"></A>land, to dwell with men of barbarous ways, and reft of every friend, I 
<A NAME="305"></A>arn become a slave though free by birth; for amongst barbarians all are 
<A NAME="306"></A>slaves but one. And the last anchor that held my fortunes, the hope that 
<A NAME="307"></A>my husband would return one day, and rid me of my woes, is now no more, 
<A NAME="308"></A>lost since the day he died. My mother too is dead, and I am called her 
<A NAME="309"></A>murderess, unjustly it is true, but still that injustice is mine to bear; 
<A NAME="310"></A>and she that was the glory of my house, my darling child, is growing old 
<A NAME="311"></A>and grey, unwedded still; and those twin brethren, called the sons of Zeus, 
<A NAME="312"></A>are now no more. But 'tis fortune, not my own doing, that hath crushed 
<A NAME="313"></A>me with sorrow and slain me. And this is the last evil of all; if ever 
<A NAME="314"></A>I come to my native land. they will shut me up in prison, thinking me that 
<A NAME="315"></A>Helen of Ilium, in quest of whom Menelaus came thither. Were my husband 
<A NAME="316"></A>still alive, we might have recognized each other, by having recourse to 
<A NAME="317"></A>tokens which ourselves alone would know. But now this may not be, nor is 
<A NAME="318"></A>there any chance of his escape. Why then do I prolong my life? What fortune 
<A NAME="319"></A>have I still in store? Shall I choose marriage as an alternative of evils, 
<A NAME="320"></A>and dwell with a barbarian lord, seated at his sumptuous board? No! when 
<A NAME="321"></A>a husband she loathes is mated with a woman, even life is loathly to her. 
<A NAME="322"></A>Best for her to die; but how shall I die a noble death? The dangling noose 
<A NAME="323"></A>is an uncomely end; even slaves consider it disgrace; to stab oneself hath 
<A NAME="324"></A>something fair and. noble in it; 'tis a small thing that moment of ridding 
<A NAME="325"></A>the flesh of life. Yes, it must be; I am plunged so deep in misery; for 
<A NAME="326"></A>that beauty, which to other women is a boon, to me hath been a very bane.

<A NAME="418"></A>carried o'er the sea to Troy, using no violence to make them follow me, 
<A NAME="419"></A>but leading all the chivalry of Hellas by voluntary consent. And some of 
<A NAME="420"></A>these must we number 'mid the slain, and some to their joy have 'scaped 
<A NAME="421"></A>the sea, bearing to their homes again names long reckoned dead. But I, 
<A NAME="422"></A>poor wretch, go wandering o'er grey Ocean's swell a weary space, long as 
<A NAME="423"></A>that which saw me sick the towers of Ilium; and for all my longing to reach 
<A NAME="424"></A>my country I am not counted worthy of this boon by heaven, but to Libya's 
<A NAME="425"></A>desert cheerless roadsteads have I sailed, to each and all of them; and 
<A NAME="426"></A>whensoe'er I draw me near my native land, the storm-wind drives me back 
<A NAME="427"></A>again, and never yet have favouring breezes filled my sails, to let me 
<A NAME="428"></A>reach my fatherland. And now a wretched, shipwrecked mariner, my friends 
<A NAME="429"></A>all lost, am I cast up upon this shore; and my ship is shattered in a thousand 
<A NAME="430"></A>pieces against the rocks; and its keel was wrested from its cunning fastenings; 
<A NAME="431"></A>thereon did I with difficulty escape, most unexpectedly, and Helen also, 
<A NAME="432"></A>for her had I rescued from Troy and had with me. But the name of this country 
<A NAME="433"></A>and its people I know not; for I blushed to mingle with the crowd to question 
<A NAME="434"></A>them, anxious for very shame to hide my misfortunes which reduce me to 
<A NAME="435"></A>these sorry rags. For when a man of high degree meets with adversity, he 
<A NAME="436"></A>feels the strangeness of his fallen state more keenly than a sufferer of 
<A NAME="437"></A>long standing. Dire want is wasting me; for I have neither food, nor raiment 
<A NAME="438"></A>to gird myself withal; behold the facts before you to judge from-I am clad 
<A NAME="439"></A>in tatters cast up from the ship; while all the robes I once did wear, 
<A NAME="440"></A>glorious attire and ornaments, bath the sea swallowed; and in a cavern's

<A NAME="443"></A>her. Alone am I come, seeking for those there left some help, if haply

<A NAME="535"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What can I think or say? For after my previous troubles, this 
<A NAME="536"></A>is a fresh piece of ill-luck I hear, if, indeed, after recovering my wife 
<A NAME="537"></A>from Troy and bringing her hither, and putting her for safety in the cave, 
<A NAME="538"></A>I am then to find another woman living here with the same name as my wife. 
<A NAME="539"></A>She called her the begotten child of Zeus. Can there be a man that hath 
<A NAME="540"></A>the name of Zeus by the banks of Nile? The Zeus of heaven is only one, 
<A NAME="541"></A>at any rate. Where is there a Sparta in the world save where Eurotas glides 
<A NAME="542"></A>between his reedy banks? The name of Tyndareus is the name of one alone. 
<A NAME="543"></A>Is there any land of the same name as Lacedaemon or Troy? I know not what 
<A NAME="544"></A>to say; for naturally there are many in the wide world that have the same 
<A NAME="545"></A>names, cities and women too; there is nothing, then, to marvel at. Nor 
<A NAME="546"></A>yet again will I fly from the alarm a servant raises; for there is none 
<A NAME="547"></A>so cruel of heart as to refuse me food when once he hears my name. All 
<A NAME="548"></A>have heard of Ilium's burning, and I, that set it ablaze, am famous now 
<A NAME="549"></A>throughout the world, I, Menelaus. I therefore wait the master of this 
<A NAME="550"></A>house. There are two issues I must watch; if he prove somewhat stern of 
<A NAME="551"></A>heart, I will to my wreck and there conceal myself; but if he show any 
<A NAME="552"></A>sign of pity, I will ask for help in this my present strait. This is the 
<A NAME="553"></A>crowning woe in all my misery, to beg the means of life from other princes, 
<A NAME="554"></A>prince though I be myself; still needs must I. Yea, this is no saying of 
<A NAME="555"></A>mine, but a word of wisdom, "Naught in might exceedeth dread necessity."

<A NAME="838"></A><B>MESSENGER</B>
<A NAME="839"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Daughter, how changeful and inscrutable is the nature of God! 
<A NAME="840"></A>With some good end doth he vary men's fortune-now up, now down; one suffers; 
<A NAME="841"></A>another who ne'er knew suffering, is in his turn to awful ruin brought, 
<A NAME="842"></A>having no assurance in his lot from day to day. Thou and thy husband have 
<A NAME="843"></A>had your share of trouble-thou in what the world has said, he in battle's 
<A NAME="844"></A>heat. For all the striving that he strove, he got him naught; while now, 
<A NAME="845"></A>without an effort made, every blessing fortune boasts is his. And thou, 
<A NAME="846"></A>in spite of all, hast brought no shame upon thy aged sire, or those twin 
<A NAME="847"></A>sons of Zeus, nor art thou guilty of those rumoured crimes. Now again do 
<A NAME="848"></A>I recall thy wedding rites, remembering the blazing torch I bore beside 
<A NAME="849"></A>thee in a four-horsed chariot at full gallop; while thou with this thy 
<A NAME="850"></A>lord, a new-made bride, wert driving forth from thy happy home. A sorry 
<A NAME="851"></A>servant he, whoso regardeth not his master's interest, sympathizing with 
<A NAME="852"></A>his sorrows and his joys. Slave though I was born, yet may I be numbered 
<A NAME="853"></A>amongst honest servants; for in heart, though not in name, I am free. For 
<A NAME="854"></A>this is better far than in my single person to suffer these two evils, 
<A NAME="855"></A>to feel my heart corrupt, and as the slave of others to be at my neighbour's 
<A NAME="856"></A>beck and call. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="861"></A>hast found them, and the issue of my fortunes; and bid them wait upon the 
<A NAME="862"></A>beach and abide the result of the struggle, which I trow awaits me; and 
<A NAME="863"></A>if mayhap we find a way to take this lady from the land by stealth, tell 
<A NAME="864"></A>them to keep good watch that we may share the luck and escape, if possible,

<A NAME="867"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>It shall be done, O king. Now I see how worthless are the seers' 
<A NAME="868"></A>tricks, how full of falsehood; nor is there after all aught trustworthy 
<A NAME="869"></A>in the blaze of sacrifice or in the cry of feathered fowls; 'tis folly, 
<A NAME="870"></A>the very notion that birds can help mankind. Calchas never by word or sign 
<A NAME="871"></A>showed the host the truth, when he saw his friends dying on behalf of a 
<A NAME="872"></A>phantom, nor yet did Helenus; but the city was stormed in vain. Perhaps 
<A NAME="873"></A>thou wilt say, 'twas not heaven's will that they should do so. Then why 
<A NAME="874"></A>do we employ these prophets? Better were it to sacrifice to the gods, and 
<A NAME="875"></A>crave a blessing, leaving prophecy alone; for this was but devised as a 
<A NAME="876"></A>bait to catch livelihood, and no man grows rich by divination if he is 
<A NAME="877"></A>idle. No! sound judgment and discernment are the best of seers.

<A NAME="1068"></A>here; for there is strife in heaven, and Zeus this very day will sit in

<A NAME="1076"></A>or to save thy life by taking Hera's side, concealing thy coming from my

<A NAME="1084"></A>my husband is returned to these loving arms; save us, I beseech thee; never 
<A NAME="1085"></A>for thy brother's sake sacrifice thy character for uprightness, by evil 
<A NAME="1086"></A>and unjust means bidding for his favour. For the deity hates violence, 
<A NAME="1087"></A>and biddeth all men get lawful gains without plundering others. Wealth 
<A NAME="1088"></A>unjustly gotten, though it bring some power, is to be eschewed. The breath 
<A NAME="1089"></A>of heaven and the earth are man's common heritage, wherein to store his

<A NAME="1091"></A>Me did Hermes at a critical time, to my sorrow, intrust to thy father's

<A NAME="1096"></A>or would they forbear? restore them, I feel sure. It is not, therefore, 
<A NAME="1097"></A>right that thou shouldst more esteem thy wanton brother than thy righteous 
<A NAME="1098"></A>father. Yet if thou, prophetess as thou art and believer in divine providence, 
<A NAME="1099"></A>shalt pervert the just intention of thy father and gratify thy unrighteous 
<A NAME="1100"></A>brother, 'tis shameful thou shouldst have full knowledge of the heavenly 
<A NAME="1101"></A>will, both what is and what is not, and yet be ignorant of justice. Oh! 
<A NAME="1102"></A>save my wretched life from the troubles which beset it, granting this as 
<A NAME="1103"></A>an accession to our good fortune; for every living soul loathes Helen, 
<A NAME="1104"></A>seeing that there is gone a rumour throughout Hellas that I was false unto 
<A NAME="1105"></A>my lord, and took up my abode in Phrygia's sumptuous halls. Now, if I come 
<A NAME="1106"></A>to Hellas, and set foot once more in Sparta, they will hear and see how 
<A NAME="1107"></A>they were ruined by the wiles of goddesses, while was no traitress to my 
<A NAME="1108"></A>friends after all; and so will they restore to me my virtuous name again, 
<A NAME="1109"></A>and I shall give my daughter in marriage, whom no man now will wed; and, 
<A NAME="1110"></A>leaving this vagrant life in Egypt, shall enjoy the treasures in my home.

<A NAME="1121"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I will not deign to throw myself at thy knees, or wet mine 
<A NAME="1122"></A>eyes with tears; for were I to play the coward, I should most foully blur 
<A NAME="1123"></A>my Trojan fame. And yet men say it shows a noble soul to let the tear-drop 
<A NAME="1124"></A>fall in misfortune. But that will not be the honourable course that I will 
<A NAME="1125"></A>choose in preference to bravery, if what I shall say is honourable. Art 
<A NAME="1126"></A>thou disposed to save a stranger seeking in mere justice to regain his 
<A NAME="1127"></A>wife, why then restore her and save us likewise; if not, this will not 
<A NAME="1128"></A>be the first by many a time that I have suffered, though thou wilt get 
<A NAME="1129"></A>an evil name. All that I deem worthy of me and honest, all that will touch 
<A NAME="1130"></A>thy heart most nearly, will I utter at the tomb of thy sire with regret 
<A NAME="1131"></A>for his loss. Old king beneath this tomb of stone reposing, pay back thy 
<A NAME="1132"></A>trust! I ask of thee my wife whom Zeus sent hither unto thee to keep for 
<A NAME="1133"></A>me. I know thou canst never restore her to me thyself, for thou art dead; 
<A NAME="1134"></A>but this thy daughter will never allow her father once so glorious, whom 
<A NAME="1135"></A>I invoke in his grave, to bear a tarnished name; for the decision rests 
<A NAME="1136"></A>with her now. Thee, too, great god of death, I call to my assistance, who 
<A NAME="1137"></A>hast received full many a corpse, slain by me for Helen, and art keeping 
<A NAME="1138"></A>thy wage; either restore those dead now to life again, or compel the daughter 
<A NAME="1139"></A>to show herself a worthy equal of her virtuous sire, and give me back my 
<A NAME="1140"></A>wife. But if ye will rob me of her, I will tell you that which she omitted 
<A NAME="1141"></A>in her speech. Know then, maiden, I by an oath am bound, first, to meet 
<A NAME="1142"></A>thy brother sword to sword, when he or I must die-there is no alternative. 
<A NAME="1143"></A>But if he refuse to meet me fairly front to front, and seek by famine to 
<A NAME="1144"></A>chase away us suppliants twain at this tomb, I am resolved to slay Helen, 
<A NAME="1145"></A>and then to plunge this two-edged sword through my own heart, upon the 
<A NAME="1146"></A>top of the sepulchre, that our streaming blood may trickle down the tomb; 
<A NAME="1147"></A>and our two corpses will be lying side by side upon this polished slab, 
<A NAME="1148"></A>a source of deathless grief to thee, and to thy sire reproach. Never shall 
<A NAME="1149"></A>thy brother wed Helen, nor shall any other; I will bear her hence myself, 
<A NAME="1150"></A>if not to my house, at any rate to death. And why this stern resolve? Were 
<A NAME="1151"></A>I to resort to women's ways and weep, I should be a pitiful creature, not 
<A NAME="1152"></A>a man of action. Slay me, if it seems thee good; I will not die ingloriously; 
<A NAME="1153"></A>but better yield to what I say, that thou mayst act with justice, and I 
<A NAME="1154"></A>regain my wife. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="1162"></A>hath her temple firmly founded in my nature, and since I have this heritage 
<A NAME="1163"></A>from Nereus I will strive to save Menelaus; wherefore, seeing it is Hera's 
<A NAME="1164"></A>will to stand thy friend, I will give my vote with her. May Cypris be favourable 
<A NAME="1165"></A>to me! though in me she hath no part, and I will try to remain a maid alway. 
<A NAME="1166"></A>As for thy reproaches against my father at this tomb; lo! I have the same 
<A NAME="1167"></A>words to utter; I should be wronging thee, did I not restore thy wife; 
<A NAME="1168"></A>for my sire, were he living, would have given her back into thy keeping, 
<A NAME="1169"></A>and thee to her. Yea, for there is recompense for these things as well 
<A NAME="1170"></A>amongst the dead as amongst all those who breathe the breath of life. The 
<A NAME="1171"></A>soul indeed of the dead lives no more, yet hath it a consciousness that 
<A NAME="1172"></A>lasts for ever, eternal as the ether into which it takes the final plunge. 
<A NAME="1173"></A>Briefly then to end the matter, I will observe strict silence on all that 
<A NAME="1174"></A>ye prayed I should, and never with my counsel will I aid my brother's wanton 
<A NAME="1175"></A>will. For I am doing him good service, though he little thinks it, if turn 
<A NAME="1176"></A>him from his godless life to holiness. Wherefore devise yourselves some 
<A NAME="1177"></A>way of escape; my lips are scaled; I will not cross your path. First with 
<A NAME="1178"></A>the goddesses begin, and of the one,-and that one Cypris,-Crave permission 
<A NAME="1179"></A>to return unto thy country; and of Hera, that her goodwill may abide in 
<A NAME="1180"></A>the same quarter, even her scheme to save thee and thy husband. And thou,
