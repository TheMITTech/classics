<BR><BR>At Pherae, outside the Palace of ADMETUS, King of Thessaly. The centre of the scene represents a portico with columns and a large double-door. To the left are the women's quarters, to the right the guest rooms. The centre doors of the Palace slowly open inwards, and Apollo comes out. In his left hand he carries a large unstrung golden bow. He moves slowly and majestically, turns, and raises his right hand in salutation to the Palace.<BR><HR SIZE="1" COLOR="990033" NOSHADE>

<A NAME="21"></A><B>APOLLO</B>
<A NAME="22"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Dwelling of Admetus, wherein I, a God, deigned to accept the 
<A NAME="23"></A>food of serfs!
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>The cause was Zeus. He struck Asclepius, my son, full in the breast 
<A NAME="25"></A>with a bolt of thunder, and laid him dead. Then in wild rage I slew the 
<A NAME="26"></A>Cyclopes who forge the fire of Zeus. To atone for this my Father forced 
<A NAME="27"></A>me to labour as a hireling for a mortal man; and I came to this country, 
<A NAME="28"></A>and tended oxen for my host. To this hour I have protected him and his. 
<A NAME="29"></A>I, who am just, chanced on the son of Pheres, a just man, whom I have saved 
<A NAME="30"></A>from Death by tricking the Fates. The Goddesses pledged me their faith 
<A NAME="31"></A>Admetus should escape immediate death if, in exchange, another corpse were 
<A NAME="32"></A>given to the Under-Gods.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>One by one he tested all his friends, and even his father and the 
<A NAME="34"></A>old mother who bad brought him forth-and found none that would die for 
<A NAME="35"></A>him and never more behold the light of day, save only his wife. Now, her 
<A NAME="36"></A>spirit waiting to break loose, she droops upon his arm within the house; 
<A NAME="37"></A>this is the day when she must die and render up her 
<A NAME="38"></A>life.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>But I must leave this Palace's dear roof, for fear pollution soil 
<A NAME="40"></A>me in the house.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>See! Death, Lord of All the Dead, now comes to lead her to the 
<A NAME="42"></A>house of Hades! Most punctually he comes! How well he marked the day she 
<A NAME="43"></A>had to die! </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="44"></A><I>From the right comes DEATH, with a drawn sword in his hand. He moves 
<A NAME="45"></A>stealthily towards the Palace; then sees APOLLO and halts abruptly. The 
<A NAME="46"></A>two Deities confront each other.</I>

<A NAME="47"></A><B>DEATH</B>
<A NAME="48"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ha! Phoebus! You! Before this Palace! Lawlessly would you grasp, 
<A NAME="49"></A>abolish the rights of the Lower Gods! Did you not beguile the Fates and 
<A NAME="50"></A>snatch Admetus from the grave? Does not that suffice? Now, once again, 
<A NAME="51"></A>you have armed your hand with the bow, to guard the daughter of Pelias 
<A NAME="52"></A>who must die in her husband's stead! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="53"></A><B>APOLLO</B>
<A NAME="54"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Fear not! I hold for right, and proffer you just words. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="55"></A><B>DEATH</B>
<A NAME="56"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>If you hold for right, why then your bow?

<A NAME="58"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>My custom is ever to carry it. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="59"></A><B>DEATH</B>
<A NAME="60"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Yes! And you use it unjustly to aid this house! 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="61"></A><B>APOLLO</B>
<A NAME="62"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I grieve for a friend's woe. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="63"></A><B>DEATH</B>
<A NAME="64"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>So you would rob me of a second body? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="65"></A><B>APOLLO</B>
<A NAME="66"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Not by force I won the other. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="67"></A><B>DEATH</B>
<A NAME="68"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Why, then, is he in the world and not below the ground? 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="69"></A><B>APOLLO</B>
<A NAME="70"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>In his stead he gives his wife-whom you have come to take. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="71"></A><B>DEATH</B>
<A NAME="72"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>And shall take-to the Underworld below the earth! 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="73"></A><B>APOLLO</B>
<A NAME="74"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Take her, and go! I know not if I can persuade you... 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="75"></A><B>DEATH</B>
<A NAME="76"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Not to kill her I must kill? I am appointed to that task. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="77"></A><B>APOLLO</B>
<A NAME="78"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No, no! But to delay death for those about to die. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="79"></A><B>DEATH</B>
<A NAME="80"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I hear your words and guess your wish! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="83"></A><B>DEATH</B>
<A NAME="84"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>No! I also prize my rights! </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="85"></A><B>APOLLO</B>
<A NAME="86"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Yet at most you win one life. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="87"></A><B>DEATH</B>
<A NAME="88"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>They who die young yield me a greater prize. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="89"></A><B>APOLLO</B>
<A NAME="90"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>If she dies old, the burial will be richer. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="91"></A><B>DEATH</B>
<A NAME="92"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Phoebus, that argument favours the rich. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="93"></A><B>APOLLO</B>
<A NAME="94"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What! Are you witty unawares? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="95"></A><B>DEATH</B>
<A NAME="96"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>The rich would gladly pay to die old. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="97"></A><B>APOLLO</B>
<A NAME="98"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>So you will not grant me this favour? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="99"></A><B>DEATH</B>
<A NAME="100"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Not I! You know my nature. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="101"></A><B>APOLLO</B>
<A NAME="102"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Yes! Hateful to men and a horror to the gods! 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="103"></A><B>DEATH</B>
<A NAME="104"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>You cannot always have more than your due. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="105"></A><B>APOLLO</B>
<A NAME="106"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Yet you shall change, most cruel though you are! For a man 
<A NAME="107"></A>comes to the dwelling of Pheres, sent by Eurystheus to fetch a horse-drawn 
<A NAME="108"></A>chariot from the harsh-wintered lands of Thrace; and he shall be a guest 
<A NAME="109"></A>in the house of Admetus, and by force shall he tear this woman from you. 
<A NAME="110"></A>Thus shall you gain no thanks from us, and yet you shall do this thing-and 
<A NAME="111"></A>my hatred be upon you </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="112"></A><I>APOLLO goes out. DEATH gazes after him derisively.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="113"></A><B>DEATH</B>
<A NAME="114"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Talk all you will, you get no more of me! The woman shall go 
<A NAME="115"></A>down to the dwelling of Hades. Now must I go to consecrate her for the 
<A NAME="116"></A>sacrifice with this sword; for when once this blade has shorn the victim's 
<A NAME="117"></A>hair, then he is sacred to the Lower Gods! </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="118"></A><I>DEATH enters the Palace by the open main door. The CHORUS enters from 
<A NAME="119"></A>the right. They are the Elders or Notables of the city, and, therefore

<A NAME="125"></A>whether she lives and looks upon the light, Alcestis, the daughter of Pelias,

<A NAME="232"></A>than gladly to die for him? This the whole city knows, but you will marvel 
<A NAME="233"></A>when you hear what she has done within the house. When she knew that the 
<A NAME="234"></A>last of her days was come she bathed her white body in river water, she 
<A NAME="235"></A>took garments and gems from her rooms of cedar wood, and clad herself nobly; 
<A NAME="236"></A>then, standing before the hearth-shrine, she uttered this 
<A NAME="237"></A>prayer:
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>'O Goddess, since now I must descend beneath the earth, for the 
<A NAME="239"></A>last time I make supplication to you: and entreat you to protect my motherless 
<A NAME="240"></A>children. Wed my son to a fair bride, and my daughter to a noble husband. 
<A NAME="241"></A>Let not my children die untimely, as I their mother am destroyed, but grant 
<A NAME="242"></A>that they live out happy lives with good fortune in their own 
<A NAME="243"></A>land!'
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>To every altar in Admetus's house she went, hung them with garlands. 
<A NAME="245"></A>offered prayer, cut myrtle boughs-unweeping, unlamenting; nor did the coming 
<A NAME="246"></A>doom change the bright colour of her face.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>Then to her marriage-room she went, flung herself down upon her 
<A NAME="248"></A>bed, and wept, and said:
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>'O my marriage-bed, wherein I loosed my virgin girdle to him for 
<A NAME="250"></A>whom I die! Farewell! I have no hatred for you. Only me you lose. Because 
<A NAME="251"></A>I held my faith to you and to my lord-I must die. Another woman shall possess 
<A NAME="252"></A>you, not more chaste indeed than I, more fortunate perhaps.'
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>She fell upon her knees and kissed it, and all the bed was damp 
<A NAME="254"></A>with the, tide of tears which flooded to her eyes. And when she was fulfilled 
<A NAME="255"></A>of many tears, drooping she rose from her bed and made as if to go, and 
<A NAME="256"></A>many times she turned to go and many times turned back, and flung herself 
<A NAME="257"></A>once more upon the bed.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>Her children clung to their mother's dress, and wept; and she clasped 
<A NAME="259"></A>them in her arms and kissed them turn by turn, as a dying 
<A NAME="260"></A>woman.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>All the servants in the house wept with compassion for their Queen, 
<A NAME="262"></A>But she held out her hand to each, and there was none so base to whom she 
<A NAME="263"></A>did not speak, and who did not reply again.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>Such is the misery in Admetus's house. If he had died, he would 
<A NAME="265"></A>be nothing now; and, having escaped, he suffers an agony he will never

<A NAME="401"></A>behold the light, I die; and yet I might have lived and wedded any in Thessaly 
<A NAME="402"></A>I chose, and dwelt with happiness in a royal home. But, torn from you, 
<A NAME="403"></A>I would not live with fatherless children, nor have I hoarded up those 
<A NAME="404"></A>gifts of youth in which I found delight. Yet he who begot you, she who 
<A NAME="405"></A>brought you forth, abandoned you when it had been beautiful in them to 
<A NAME="406"></A>die, beautiful to die with dignity to save their son! They had no child 
<A NAME="407"></A>but you, no hope if you were dead that other children might be born to 
<A NAME="408"></A>them. Thus I should have lived my life out, and you too, and you would 
<A NAME="409"></A>not lament as now, made solitary from your wife, that you must rear our 
<A NAME="410"></A>children motherless!
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>But these things are a God's doing and are thus.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Well! Do not forget this gift, for I shall ask-not a recompense, since 
<A NAME="413"></A>nothing is more precious than life, but-only what is just, as you yourself 
<A NAME="414"></A>will say, since if you have not lost your senses you must love these children 
<A NAME="415"></A>no less than I. Let them be masters in my house; marry not again, and set 
<A NAME="416"></A>a stepmother over them, a woman harsher than I, who in her jealousy will 
<A NAME="417"></A>lift her hand against my children and yours. Ah! not this, let not this 
<A NAME="418"></A>be, I entreat you! The new stepmother hates the first wife's children, 
<A NAME="419"></A>the viper itself is not more cruel. The son indeed finds a strong rampart 
<A NAME="420"></A>in his father-but you, my daughter, how shall you live your virgin life 
<A NAME="421"></A>out in happiness? How will you fare with your father's new wife? Ah! Let 
<A NAME="422"></A>her not cast evil report upon you and thus wreck your marriage in the height 
<A NAME="423"></A>of your youth! You will have no mother, O my child, to give you in marriage, 
<A NAME="424"></A>to comfort you in childbed when none is tenderer than a 
<A NAME="425"></A>mother!
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>And I must die. Not to-morrow. nor to-morrow's morrow comes this 
<A NAME="427"></A>misfortune on me, but even now I shall be named with those that are no 
<A NAME="428"></A>more. Farewell! Live happy! You, my husband, may boast you had the best

<A NAME="918"></A>have I robbed you? Do not die for me, any more than I die for you. You 
<A NAME="919"></A>love to look upon the light of day-do you think your father hates it? I

<A NAME="1209"></A>O friends, whatsoever may be thought by others, to me it seems that my 
<A NAME="1210"></A>wife's fate is happier than mine. Now, no pain ever shall touch her again; 
<A NAME="1211"></A>she has reached the noble end of all her sufferings. But I, I who should 
<A NAME="1212"></A>have died, I have escaped my fate, only to drag out a wretched life. Only 
<A NAME="1213"></A>now do I perceive it.
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR><BR>How shall I summon strength to enter this house? Whom shall I greet? 
<A NAME="1215"></A>Who will greet me in joy at my coming? Whither shall I turn my steps? I 
<A NAME="1216"></A>shall be driven forth by solitude when I see my bed widowed of my wife, 
<A NAME="1217"></A>empty the chairs on which she sat, a dusty floor beneath my roof, my children 
<A NAME="1218"></A>falling at my knees and calling for their mother, and the servants lamenting 
<A NAME="1219"></A>for the noble lady lost from the house!
<A NAME="1220"></A><BR><BR>Such will be my life within the house. Without, I shall be driven 
<A NAME="1221"></A>from marriage-feasts and gatherings of the women of Thessaly. I shall not 
<A NAME="1222"></A>endure to look upon my wife's friends. Those who hate me will say: 'See 
<A NAME="1223"></A>how he lives in shame, the man who dared not die, the coward who gave his 
<A NAME="1224"></A>wife to Hades in his stead! Is that a man? He hates his parents, yet he 
<A NAME="1225"></A>himself refused to die!'
<A NAME="1226"></A><BR><BR>This evil fame I have added to my other sorrows. O my friends, 
<A NAME="1227"></A>what then avails it that I live, if I must live in misery and shame?

<A NAME="1281"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Admetus, a man should speak freely to his friends, and not 
<A NAME="1282"></A>keep reproaches silent in his heart. Since I was near you in your misfortune, 
<A NAME="1283"></A>should have wished to show myself your friend. But you did not tell me 
<A NAME="1284"></A>the dead body was your wife's, and you took me into your house as if you 
<A NAME="1285"></A>were in mourning only for a stranger. And I put a garland of flowers upon 
<A NAME="1286"></A>my head, and poured wine-offerings to the Gods, when your house was filled 
<A NAME="1287"></A>with lamentation. I blame you, yes, I blame you for this-but I will not 
<A NAME="1288"></A>upbraid you in your misfortune.
<A NAME="1289"></A><BR><BR>Why I turned back and am here, I shall tell you. Take and keep 
<A NAME="1290"></A>this woman for me until I have slain the King of the Bistones and return 
<A NAME="1291"></A>here with the horses of Thrace. If ill happens to me-may I return safely!-I 
<A NAME="1292"></A>give her to you to serve in your house.
<A NAME="1293"></A><BR><BR>With much striving I won her to my hands. On my way I found public 
<A NAME="1294"></A>games, worthy of athletes, and I have brought back this woman whom I won 
<A NAME="1295"></A>as the prize of victory. The winners of the easy tests had horses; heads 
<A NAME="1296"></A>of cattle were given to those who won in boxing and wrestling. Then came 
<A NAME="1297"></A>a woman as a prize. Since I was present, it would have been shameful for 
<A NAME="1298"></A>me to miss this glorious gain. Therefore, as I said, you must take care 
<A NAME="1299"></A>of this woman, whom I bring to you, not as one stolen but as the prize 
<A NAME="1300"></A>of my efforts. Perhaps in time you will approve of what I do.

<A NAME="1302"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Not from disdain, nor to treat you as a foe, did I conceal

<A NAME="1304"></A>one more grief had been added to my sorrow. It was enough that I should 
<A NAME="1305"></A>weep my woe.
<A NAME="1306"></A><BR><BR>This woman-O King, I beg it may be thus-enjoin some other Thessalian, 
<A NAME="1307"></A>one who is not in sorrow, to guard her. In Pherae there are many to welcome 
<A NAME="1308"></A>you. Do not remind me of my grief. Seeing her in my house, I could not 
<A NAME="1309"></A>restrain my tears. Add not a further anguish to my pain, for what I suffer 
<A NAME="1310"></A>is too great. And then-where could I harbour a young woman in my house? 
<A NAME="1311"></A>For she is young-I see by her clothes and jewels. Could she live with the 
<A NAME="1312"></A>men under my roof? How, then, could she remain chaste, if she moved to 
<A NAME="1313"></A>and fro among the young men? Heracles, it is not easy to restrain the young....I 
<A NAME="1314"></A>am thinking of your interests....Must I take her to my dead wife's room? 
<A NAME="1315"></A>How could I endure her to enter that bed? I fear a double reproach-from 
<A NAME="1316"></A>my people, who would accuse me of betraying my saviour to slip into another 
<A NAME="1317"></A>woman's bed, and from my dead wife, who deserves my respect, for which 
<A NAME="1318"></A>I must take care.
<A NAME="1319"></A><BR><BR>O woman, whosoever you may be, you have the form of Alcestis, and 
<A NAME="1320"></A>your body is like hers.
<A NAME="1321"></A><BR><BR>Ah! By all the Gods, take her from my sight! Do not insult a broken 
<A NAME="1322"></A>man. When I look upon her-she seems my wife-my heart is torn asunder-tears
