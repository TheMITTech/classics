<A NAME="20"></A><B>DIONYSUS</B>
<A NAME="21"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Lo! I am come to this land of Thebes, Dionysus' the son of 
<A NAME="22"></A>Zeus, of whom on a day Semele, the daughter of Cadmus, was delivered by 
<A NAME="23"></A>a flash of lightning. I have put off the god and taken human shape, and 
<A NAME="24"></A>so present myself at Dirce's springs and the waters of Ismenus. Yonder 
<A NAME="25"></A>I see my mother's monument where the bolt slew her nigh her house, and 
<A NAME="26"></A>there are the ruins of her home smouldering with the heavenly flame that 
<A NAME="27"></A>blazeth still-Hera's deathless outrage on my mother. To Cadmus all praise 
<A NAME="28"></A>I offer, because he keeps this spot hallowed, his daughter's precinct, 
<A NAME="29"></A>which my own hands have shaded round about with the vine's clustering 
<A NAME="30"></A>foliage.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>Lydia's glebes, where gold abounds, and Phrygia have I left behind; 
<A NAME="32"></A>o'er Persia's sun-baked plains, by Bactria's walled towns and Media's wintry 
<A NAME="33"></A>clime have I advanced through Arabia, land of promise; and Asia's length 
<A NAME="34"></A>and breadth, outstretched along the brackish sea, with many a fair walled 
<A NAME="35"></A>town, peopled with mingled race of Hellenes and barbarians; and this is 
<A NAME="36"></A>the first city in Hellas I have reached. There too have I ordained dances 
<A NAME="37"></A>and established my rites, that I might manifest my godhead to men; but 
<A NAME="38"></A>Thebes is the first city in the land of Hellas that I have made ring with 
<A NAME="39"></A>shouts of joy, girt in a fawn-skin, with a thyrsus, my ivy-bound spear, 
<A NAME="40"></A>in my hand; since my mother's sisters, who least of all should have done 
<A NAME="41"></A>it, denied that Dionysus was the son of Zeus, saying that Semele, when 
<A NAME="42"></A>she became a mother by some mortal lover, tried to foist her sin on Zeus-a 
<A NAME="43"></A>clever ruse of Cadmus, which, they boldly asserted, caused Zeus to slay 
<A NAME="44"></A>her for the falsehood about the marriage. Wherefore these are they whom 
<A NAME="45"></A>I have driven frenzied from their homes, and they are dwelling on the hills 
<A NAME="46"></A>with mind distraught; and I have forced them to assume the dress worn in 
<A NAME="47"></A>my orgies, and all the women-folk of Cadmus' stock have I driven raving 
<A NAME="48"></A>from their homes, one and all alike; and there they sit upon the roofless 
<A NAME="49"></A>rocks beneath the green pine-trees, mingling amongst the sons of Thebes. 
<A NAME="50"></A>For this city must learn, however loth, seeing that it is not initiated 
<A NAME="51"></A>in my Bacchic rites, and I must take up my mother's defence, by showing 
<A NAME="52"></A>to mortals that the child she bore to Zeus is a deity. Now Cadmus gave 
<A NAME="53"></A>his sceptre and its privileges to Pentheus, his daughter's child, who wages 
<A NAME="54"></A>war 'gainst my divinity, thrusting me away from his drink-offerings, and 
<A NAME="55"></A>making no mention of me in his prayers. Therefore will I prove to him and 
<A NAME="56"></A>all the race of Cadmus that I am a god. And when I have set all in order 
<A NAME="57"></A>here, I will pass hence to a fresh country, manifesting myself; but if 
<A NAME="58"></A>the city of Thebes in fury takes up arms and seeks to drive my votaries 
<A NAME="59"></A>from the mountain, I will meet them at the head of my frantic rout. This 
<A NAME="60"></A>is why I have assumed a mortal form, and put off my godhead to take man's 
<A NAME="61"></A>nature.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>O ye who left Tmolus, the bulwark of Lydia, ye women, my revel 
<A NAME="63"></A>rout! whom I brought from your foreign homes to be ever by my side and 
<A NAME="64"></A>bear me company, uplift the cymbals native to your Phrygian home, that 
<A NAME="65"></A>were by me and the great mother Rhea first devised, and march around the 
<A NAME="66"></A>royal halls of Pentheus smiting them, that the city of Cadmus may see you; 
<A NAME="67"></A>while I will seek Cithaeron's glens, there with my Bacchanals to join the 
<A NAME="68"></A>dance. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="69"></A><I>Exit DIONYSUS.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="70"></A><I>Enter CHORUS.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="71"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="72"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>From Asia o'er the holy ridge of Tmolus hasten to a pleasant 
<A NAME="73"></A>task, a toil that brings no weariness, for Bromius' sake, in honour of 
<A NAME="74"></A>the Bacchic god. Who loiters in the road? who lingers 'neath the roof? 
<A NAME="75"></A>Avaunt! I say, and let every lip be hushed in solemn silence; for I will 
<A NAME="76"></A>raise a hymn to Dionysus, as custom aye ordains. O happy he! who to his 
<A NAME="77"></A>joy is initiated in heavenly mysteries and leads a holy life, joining heart 
<A NAME="78"></A>and soul in Bacchic revelry upon the hills, purified from every sin; observing 
<A NAME="79"></A>the rites of Cybele, the mighty mother, and brandishing the thyrsus, with 
<A NAME="80"></A>ivy-wreathed head, he worships Dionysus. Go forth, go forth, ye Bacchanals, 
<A NAME="81"></A>bring home the Bromian god Dionysus, child of a god, from the mountains 
<A NAME="82"></A>of Phrygia to the spacious streets of Hellas, bring home the Bromian god! 
<A NAME="83"></A>whom on a day his mother in her sore travail brought forth untimely, yielding 
<A NAME="84"></A>up her life beneath the lightning stroke of Zeus' winged bolt; but forthwith 
<A NAME="85"></A>Zeus, the son of Cronos, found for him another womb wherein to rest, for 
<A NAME="86"></A>he hid him in his thigh and fastened it with golden pins to conceal him 
<A NAME="87"></A>from Hera. And when the Fates had fully formed the horned god, he brought 
<A NAME="88"></A>him forth and crowned him with a coronal of snakes, whence it is the thyrsus-bearing 
<A NAME="89"></A>Maenads hunt the snake to twine about their hair. O Thebes, nurse of Semele! 
<A NAME="90"></A>crown thyself with ivy; burst forth, burst forth with blossoms fair of 
<A NAME="91"></A>green convolvulus, and with the boughs of oak and pine join in the Bacchic 
<A NAME="92"></A>revelry; dor;-thy coat of dappled fawn-skin, decking it with tufts of silvered 
<A NAME="93"></A>hair; with reverent hand the sportive wand now wield. Anon shall the whole 
<A NAME="94"></A>land be dancing, when Bromius leads his revellers to the hills, to the 
<A NAME="95"></A>hills away! where wait him groups of maidens from loom and shuttle roused 
<A NAME="96"></A>in frantic haste by Dionysus. O hidden cave of the Curetes! O hallowed 
<A NAME="97"></A>haunts in Crete, that saw Zeus born, where Corybantes with crested helms 
<A NAME="98"></A>devised for me in their grotto the rounded timbrel of ox-hide, mingling 
<A NAME="99"></A>Bacchic minstrelsy with the shrill sweet accents of the Phrygian flute, 
<A NAME="100"></A>a gift bestowed by them on mother Rhea, to add its crash of music to the 
<A NAME="101"></A>Bacchantes' shouts of joy; but frantic satyrs won it from the mother-goddess 
<A NAME="102"></A>for their own, and added it to their dances in festivals, which gladden 
<A NAME="103"></A>the heart of Dionysus, each third recurrent year. Oh! happy that votary, 
<A NAME="104"></A>when from the hurrying revel-rout he sinks to earth, in his holy robe of 
<A NAME="105"></A>fawnskin, chasing the goat to drink its blood, a banquet sweet of flesh 
<A NAME="106"></A>uncooked, as he hastes to Phrygia's or to Libya's hills; while in the van 
<A NAME="107"></A>the Bromian god exults with cries of Evoe. With milk and wine and streams 
<A NAME="108"></A>of luscious honey flows the earth, and Syrian incense smokes. While the 
<A NAME="109"></A>Bacchante holding in his hand a blazing torch of pine uplifted on his wand 
<A NAME="110"></A>waves it, as he speeds along, rousing wandering votaries, and as he waves 
<A NAME="111"></A>it cries aloud with wanton tresses tossing in the breeze; and thus to crown 
<A NAME="112"></A>the revelry, he raises loud his voice, "On, on, ye Bacchanals, pride of 
<A NAME="113"></A>Tmolus with its rills of gold I to the sound of the booming drum, chanting 
<A NAME="114"></A>in joyous strains the praises of your joyous god with Phrygian accents 
<A NAME="115"></A>lifted high, what time the holy lute with sweet complaining note invites 
<A NAME="116"></A>you to your hallowed sport, according well with feet that hurry wildly 
<A NAME="117"></A>to the hills; like a colt that gambols at its mother's side in the pasture, 
<A NAME="118"></A>with gladsome heart each Bacchante bounds along." </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="123"></A>Go one of you, announce to him that Teiresias is seeking him; he knows 
<A NAME="124"></A>himself the reason of my coming and the compact I and he have made in our

<A NAME="131"></A>'tis but right I should magnify with all my might my own daughter's son, 
<A NAME="132"></A>Dionysus, who hath shown his godhead unto men. Where are we to join the 
<A NAME="133"></A>dance? where plant the foot and shake the hoary head? Do thou, Teiresias, 
<A NAME="134"></A>be my guide, age leading age, for thou art wise. Never shall I weary, night 
<A NAME="135"></A>or day, of beating the earth with my thyrsus. What joy to forget our years?

<A NAME="159"></A>faith we inherited from our fathers, old as time itself, no reasoning shall 
<A NAME="160"></A>cast down; no! though it were the subtlest invention of wits refined. Maybe 
<A NAME="161"></A>some one will say, I have no respect for my grey hair in going to dance 
<A NAME="162"></A>with ivy round my head; not so, for the god did not define whether old 
<A NAME="163"></A>or young should dance, but from all alike he claims a universal homage, 
<A NAME="164"></A>and scorns nice calculations in his worship. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="165"></A><B>CADMUS</B>
<A NAME="166"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Teiresias, since thou art blind, I must prompt thee what to 
<A NAME="167"></A>say. Pentheus is coming hither to the house in haste, Echion's son, to 
<A NAME="168"></A>whom I resign the government. How scared he looks I what strange tidings 
<A NAME="169"></A>will he tell? </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="170"></A><I>Enter PENTHEUS.</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="171"></A><B>PENTHEUS</B>
<A NAME="172"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I had left my kingdom for awhile, when tidings of strange mischief 
<A NAME="173"></A>in this city reached me; I hear that our women-folk have left their homes 
<A NAME="174"></A>on pretence of Bacchic rites, and on the wooded hills rush wildly to and 
<A NAME="175"></A>fro, honouring in the dance this new god Dionysus, whoe'er he is; and in 
<A NAME="176"></A>the midst of each revel-rout the brimming wine-bowl stands, and one by 
<A NAME="177"></A>one they steal away to lonely spots to gratify their lust, pretending forsooth 
<A NAME="178"></A>that they are Maenads bent on sacrifice, though it is Aphrodite they are 
<A NAME="179"></A>placing before the Bacchic god. As many as I caught, my gaolers are keeping 
<A NAME="180"></A>safe in the public prison fast bound; and all who are gone forth, will 
<A NAME="181"></A>I chase from the hills, Ino and Agave too who bore me to Echion, and Actaeon's 
<A NAME="182"></A>mother Autonoe. In fetters of iron will I bind them and soon put an end 
<A NAME="183"></A>to these outrageous Bacchic rites. They say there came a stranger hither, 
<A NAME="184"></A>a trickster and a sorcerer, from Lydia's land, with golden hair and perfumed 
<A NAME="185"></A>locks, the flush of wine upon his face, and in his eyes each grace that 
<A NAME="186"></A>Aphrodite gives; by day and night he lingers in our maidens' company on 
<A NAME="187"></A>the plea of teaching Bacchic mysteries. Once let me catch him within these 
<A NAME="188"></A>walls, and I will put an end to his thyrsus-beating and his waving of his 
<A NAME="189"></A>tresses, for I will cut his head from his body. This is the fellow who 
<A NAME="190"></A>says that Dionysus is a god, says that he was once stitched up in the thigh 
<A NAME="191"></A>of Zeus-that child who with his mother was blasted by the lightning flash, 
<A NAME="192"></A>because the woman falsely said her marriage was with Zeus. Is not this 
<A NAME="193"></A>enough to deserve the awful penalty of hanging, this stranger's wanton 
<A NAME="194"></A>insolence, whoe'er he be?
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>But lo! another marvel. I see Teiresias, our diviner, dressed in 
<A NAME="196"></A>dappled fawn-skins, and my mother's father too, wildly waving the Bacchic 
<A NAME="197"></A>wand; droll sight enough! Father, it grieves me to see you two old men 
<A NAME="198"></A>so void of sense. Oh! shake that ivy from thee! Let fall the thyrsus from 
<A NAME="199"></A>thy hand, my mother's sire! Was it thou, Teiresias, urged him on to this? 
<A NAME="200"></A>Art bent on introducing this fellow as another new deity amongst men, that 
<A NAME="201"></A>thou mayst then observe the fowls of the air and make a gain from fiery 
<A NAME="202"></A>divination? Were it not that thy grey hairs protected thee, thou shouldst 
<A NAME="203"></A>sit in chains amid the Bacchanals, for introducing knavish mysteries; for 
<A NAME="204"></A>where the gladsome grape is found at women's feasts, I deny that their 
<A NAME="205"></A>rites have any longer good results. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="206"></A><B>CHORUS</B>
<A NAME="207"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>What impiety! Hast thou no reverence, sir stranger, for the 
<A NAME="208"></A>gods or for Cadmus who sowed the crop of earth-born warriors? Son of Echion 
<A NAME="209"></A>as thou art, thou dost shame thy birth. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="210"></A><B>TEIRESIAS</B>
<A NAME="211"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Whenso a man of wisdom finds a good topic for argument, it 
<A NAME="212"></A>is no difficult matter to speak well; but thou, though possessing a glib 
<A NAME="213"></A>tongue as if endowed with sense, art yet devoid thereof in all thou sayest. 
<A NAME="214"></A>A headstrong man, if he have influence and a capacity for speaking, makes 
<A NAME="215"></A>a bad citizen because he lacks sense. This new deity, whom thou deridest, 
<A NAME="216"></A>will rise to power I cannot say how great, throughout Hellas. Two things 
<A NAME="217"></A>there are, young prince, that hold first rank among men, the goddess Demeter, 
<A NAME="218"></A>that is, the earth, calf her which name thou please; she it is that feedeth 
<A NAME="219"></A>men with solid food; and as her counterpart came this god, the son of Semele, 
<A NAME="220"></A>who discovered the juice of the grape and introduced it to mankind, stilling 
<A NAME="221"></A>thereby each grief that mortals suffer from, soon as e'er they are filled 
<A NAME="222"></A>with the juice of the vine; and sleep also he giveth, sleep that brings 
<A NAME="223"></A>forgetfulness of daily ills, the sovereign charm for all our woe. God though 
<A NAME="224"></A>he is, he serves all other gods for libations, so that through him mankind 
<A NAME="225"></A>is blest. He it is whom thou dost mock, because he was sewn up in the thigh 
<A NAME="226"></A>of Zeus. But I will show thee this fair mystery. When Zeus had snatched 
<A NAME="227"></A>him from the lightning's blaze, and to Olympus borne the tender babe, Hera 
<A NAME="228"></A>would have cast him forth from heaven, but Zeus, as such a god well might, 
<A NAME="229"></A>devised a counterplot. He broke off a fragment of the ether which surrounds 
<A NAME="230"></A>the world, and made thereof a hostage against Hera's bitterness, while 
<A NAME="231"></A>he gave out Dionysus into other hands; hence, in time, men said that he 
<A NAME="232"></A>was reared in the thigh of Zeus, having changed the word and invented a 
<A NAME="233"></A>legend, because the god was once a hostage to the goddess Hera. This god 
<A NAME="234"></A>too hath prophetic power, for there is no small prophecy inspired by Bacchic 
<A NAME="235"></A>frenzy; for whenever the god in his full might enters the human frame, 
<A NAME="236"></A>he makes his frantic votaries foretell the future. Likewise he hath some 
<A NAME="237"></A>share in Ares' rights; for oft, or ever a weapon is touched, a panic seizes 
<A NAME="238"></A>an army when it is marshalled in array; and this too is a frenzy sent by 
<A NAME="239"></A>Dionysus. Yet shalt thou behold him e'en on Delphi's rocks leaping o'er 
<A NAME="240"></A>the cloven height, torch in hand, waving and brandishing the branch by 
<A NAME="241"></A>Bacchus loved, yea, and through the length and breadth of Hellas. Hearken 
<A NAME="242"></A>to me, Pentheus; never boast that might alone doth sway the world, nor 
<A NAME="243"></A>if thou think so, unsound as thy opinion is, credit thyself with any wisdom; 
<A NAME="244"></A>but receive the god into thy realm, pour out libations, join the revel 
<A NAME="245"></A>rout, and crown thy head. It is not Dionysus that will force chastity on 
<A NAME="246"></A>women in their love; but this is what we should consider, whether chastity 
<A NAME="247"></A>is part of their nature for good and all; for if it is, no really modest 
<A NAME="248"></A>maid will ever fall 'mid Bacchic mysteries. Mark this: thou thyself art 
<A NAME="249"></A>glad when thousands throng thy gates, and citizens extol the name of Pentheus; 
<A NAME="250"></A>he too, I trow, delights in being honoured. Wherefore I and Cadmus, whom 
<A NAME="251"></A>thou jeerest so, will wreath our brows with ivy and join the dance; pair 
<A NAME="252"></A>of grey beards though we be, still must we take part therein; never will 
<A NAME="253"></A>I for any words of thine fight against heaven. Most grievous is thy madness, 
<A NAME="254"></A>nor canst thou find a charm to cure thee, albeit charms have caused thy 
<A NAME="255"></A>malady. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="293"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>O holiness, queen amongst the gods, sweeping on golden pinion 
<A NAME="294"></A>o'er the earth! dost hear the words of Pentheus, dost hear his proud blaspheming 
<A NAME="295"></A>Bromius, the son of Semele; first of all the blessed gods at every merry 
<A NAME="296"></A>festival? His it is to rouse the revellers to dance, to laugh away dull 
<A NAME="297"></A>care, and wake the flute, whene'er at banquets of the gods the luscious 
<A NAME="298"></A>grape appears, or when the winecup in the feast sheds sleep on men who 
<A NAME="299"></A>wear the ivy-spray. The end of all unbridled speech and lawless senselessness 
<A NAME="300"></A>is misery; but the life of calm repose and the rule of reason abide unshaken 
<A NAME="301"></A>and support the home; for far away in heaven though they dwell, the powers 
<A NAME="302"></A>divine behold man's state. Sophistry is not wisdom, and to indulge in thoughts 
<A NAME="303"></A>beyond man's ken is to shorten life; and if a man on such poor terms should 
<A NAME="304"></A>aim too high, he may miss the pleasures in his reach. These, to my mind, 
<A NAME="305"></A>are the ways of madmen and idiots. Oh! to make my way to Cyprus, isle of 
<A NAME="306"></A>Aphrodite, where dwell the love-gods strong to soothe man's soul, or to 
<A NAME="307"></A>Paphos, which that foreign river, never fed by rain, enriches with its 
<A NAME="308"></A>hundred mouths! Oh! lead me, Bromian god, celestial guide of Bacchic pilgrims, 
<A NAME="309"></A>to the hallowed slopes of Olympus, where Pierian Muses have their haunt 
<A NAME="310"></A>most fair. There dwell the Graces; there is soft desire; there thy votaries 
<A NAME="311"></A>may hold their revels freely. The joy of our god, the son of Zeus, is in 
<A NAME="312"></A>banquets, his delight is in peace, that giver of riches and nurse divine 
<A NAME="313"></A>of youth. Both to rich and poor alike hath he granted the delight of wine, 
<A NAME="314"></A>that makes all pain to cease; hateful to him is every one who careth not 
<A NAME="315"></A>to live the life of bliss, that lasts through days and nights of joy. True 
<A NAME="316"></A>wisdom is to keep the heart and soul aloof from over-subtle wits. That 
<A NAME="317"></A>which the less enlightened crowd approves and practises, will I accept.

<A NAME="546"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>There too I mocked him; he thinks he bound me, whereas he never 
<A NAME="547"></A>touched or caught hold of me, but fed himself on fancy. For at the stall, 
<A NAME="548"></A>to which he brought me for a gaol, he found a bull, whose legs and hoofs 
<A NAME="549"></A>he straightly tied, breathing out fury the while, the sweat trickling from 
<A NAME="550"></A>his body, and he biting his lips; but I from near at hand sat calmly looking 
<A NAME="551"></A>on. Meantime came the Bacchic god and made the house quake, and at his 
<A NAME="552"></A>mother's tomb relit the fire; but Pentheus, seeing this, thought his palace 
<A NAME="553"></A>was ablaze, and hither and thither he rushed, bidding his servants bring 
<A NAME="554"></A>water; but all in vain was every servant's busy toil. Thereon he let this 
<A NAME="555"></A>labour be awhile, and, thinking maybe that I had escaped, rushed into the 
<A NAME="556"></A>palace with his murderous sword unsheathed. Then did Bromius-so at least 
<A NAME="557"></A>it seemed to me; I only tell you what I thought-made a phantom in the hall, 
<A NAME="558"></A>and he rushed after it in headlong haste, and stabbed the lustrous air, 
<A NAME="559"></A>thinking he wounded me. Further the Bacchic god did other outrage to him; 
<A NAME="560"></A>he dashed the building to the ground, and there it lies a mass of ruin, 
<A NAME="561"></A>a sight to make him rue most bitterly my bonds. At last from sheer fatigue 
<A NAME="562"></A>he dropped his sword and fell fainting; for he a mortal frail, dared to 
<A NAME="563"></A>wage war upon a god; but I meantime quietly left the house and am come 
<A NAME="564"></A>to you, with never a thought of Pentheus. But methinks he will soon appear 
<A NAME="565"></A>before the house; at least there is a sound of steps within. What will 
<A NAME="566"></A>he say, I wonder, after this? Well, be his fury never so great, I will

<A NAME="619"></A><B>MESSENGER</B>
<A NAME="620"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I was just driving the herds of kine to a ridge of the hill 
<A NAME="621"></A>as I fed them, as the sun shot forth his rays and made the earth grow warm; 
<A NAME="622"></A>when lo! I see three revel-bands of women; Autonoe was chief of one, thy 
<A NAME="623"></A>mother Agave of the second, while Ino's was the third. There they lay asleep, 
<A NAME="624"></A>all tired out; some were resting on branches of the pine, others had laid 
<A NAME="625"></A>their heads in careless ease on oak-leaves piled upon the ground, observing 
<A NAME="626"></A>all modesty; not, as thou sayest, seeking to gratify their lusts alone 
<A NAME="627"></A>amid the woods, by wine and soft flute-music maddened.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR><BR>Anon in their midst thy mother uprose and cried aloud to wake them 
<A NAME="629"></A>from their sleep, when she heard the lowing of my horned kine. And up they 
<A NAME="630"></A>started to their feet, brushing from their eyes sleep's quickening dew, 
<A NAME="631"></A>a wondrous sight of grace and modesty, young and old and maidens yet unwed. 
<A NAME="632"></A>First o'er their shoulders they let stream their hair; then all did gird 
<A NAME="633"></A>their fawn-skins up, who hitherto had left the fastenings loose, girdling 
<A NAME="634"></A>the dappled hides with snakes that licked their cheeks. Others fondled 
<A NAME="635"></A>in their arms gazelles or savage whelps of wolves, and suckled them-young 
<A NAME="636"></A>mothers these with babes at home, whose breasts were still full of milk; 
<A NAME="637"></A>crowns they wore of ivy or of oak or blossoming convolvulus. And one took 
<A NAME="638"></A>her thyrsus and struck it into the earth, and forth there gushed a limpid 
<A NAME="639"></A>spring; and another plunged her wand into the lap of earth and there the 
<A NAME="640"></A>god sent up a fount of wine; and all who wished for draughts of milk had 
<A NAME="641"></A>but to scratch the soil with their finger-tips and there they had it in 
<A NAME="642"></A>abundance, while from every ivy-wreathed staff sweet rills of honey 
<A NAME="643"></A>trickled.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>Hadst thou been there and seen this, thou wouldst have turned to 
<A NAME="645"></A>pray to the god, whom now thou dost disparage. Anon we herdsmen and shepherds 
<A NAME="646"></A>met to discuss their strange and wondrous doings; then one, who wandereth 
<A NAME="647"></A>oft to town and hath a trick of speech, made harangue in the midst, "O 
<A NAME="648"></A>ye who dwell upon the hallowed mountain-terraces! shall we chase Agave, 
<A NAME="649"></A>mother of Pentheus, from her Bacchic rites, and thereby do our prince a 
<A NAME="650"></A>service?" We liked his speech, and placed ourselves in hidden ambush among 
<A NAME="651"></A>the leafy thickets; they at the appointed time began to wave the thyrsus 
<A NAME="652"></A>for their Bacchic rites, calling on Iacchus, the Bromian god, the son of 
<A NAME="653"></A>Zeus, in united chorus, and the whole mount and the wild creatures re-echoed 
<A NAME="654"></A>their cry; all nature stirred as they rushed on. Now Agave chanced to come 
<A NAME="655"></A>springing near me, so up I leapt from out my ambush where I lay concealed, 
<A NAME="656"></A>meaning to seize her. But she cried out, "What ho! my nimble hounds, here 
<A NAME="657"></A>are men upon our track; but follow me, ay, follow, with the thyrsus in 
<A NAME="658"></A>your hand for weapon." Thereat we fled, to escape being torn in pieces 
<A NAME="659"></A>by the Bacchantes; but they, with hands that bore no weapon of steel, attacked 
<A NAME="660"></A>our cattle as they browsed. Then wouldst thou have seen Agave mastering 
<A NAME="661"></A>some sleek lowing calf, while others rent the heifers limb from limb. Before 
<A NAME="662"></A>thy eyes there would have been hurling of ribs and hoofs this way and that; 
<A NAME="663"></A>and strips of flesh, all blood-bedabbled, dripped as they hung from the 
<A NAME="664"></A>pine-branches. Wild bulls, that glared but now with rage along their horns, 
<A NAME="665"></A>found themselves tripped up, dragged down to earth by countless maidens' 
<A NAME="666"></A>hands. The flesh upon their limbs was stripped therefrom quicker than thou 
<A NAME="667"></A>couldst have closed thy royal eye-lids. Then off they sped, like birds 
<A NAME="668"></A>that skim the air, to the plains beneath the hills, which bear a fruitful 
<A NAME="669"></A>harvest for Thebes beside the waters of Asopus; to Hysiae and Erythrae, 
<A NAME="670"></A>hamlets 'neath Cithaeron's peak, with fell intent, swooping on everything 
<A NAME="671"></A>and scattering all pellmell; and they would snatch children from their 
<A NAME="672"></A>homes; but all that they placed upon their shoulders, abode there firmly 
<A NAME="673"></A>without being tied, and fell not to the dusky earth, not even brass or 
<A NAME="674"></A>iron; and on their hair they carried fire and it burnt them not; but the 
<A NAME="675"></A>country-folk rushed to arms, furious at being pillaged by Bacchanals; whereon 
<A NAME="676"></A>ensued, O king, this wondrous spectacle. For though the ironshod dart would 
<A NAME="677"></A>draw no blood from them, they with the thyrsus, which they hurled, caused 
<A NAME="678"></A>many a wound and put their foes to utter rout, women chasing men, by some 
<A NAME="679"></A>god's intervention. Then they returned to the place whence they had started, 
<A NAME="680"></A>even to the springs the god had made to spout for them; and there washed 
<A NAME="681"></A>off the blood, while serpents with their tongues were licking clean each 
<A NAME="682"></A>gout from their cheeks. Wherefore, my lord and master, receive this deity, 
<A NAME="683"></A>whoe'er he be, within the city; for, great as he is in all else, I have 
<A NAME="684"></A>likewise heard men say, 'twas he that gave the vine to man, sorrow's antidote. 
<A NAME="685"></A>Take wine away and Cypris flies, and every other human joy is dead.

<A NAME="1008"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Soon as we had left the homesteads of this Theban land and 
<A NAME="1009"></A>had crossed the streams of Asopus, we began to breast Cithaeron's heights, 
<A NAME="1010"></A>Pentheus and I, for I went with my master, and the stranger too, who was 
<A NAME="1011"></A>to guide us to the scene. First then we sat us down in a grassy glen, carefully 
<A NAME="1012"></A>silencing each footfall and whispered breath, to see without being seen. 
<A NAME="1013"></A>Now there was a dell walled in by rocks, with rills to water it, and shady 
<A NAME="1014"></A>pines o'erhead; there were the Maenads seated, busied with joyous toils. 
<A NAME="1015"></A>Some were wreathing afresh the drooping thyrsus with curling ivy-sprays; 
<A NAME="1016"></A>others, like colts let loose from the carved chariot-yoke, were answering 
<A NAME="1017"></A>each other in hymns of Bacchic rapture. But Pentheus, son of sorrow, seeing 
<A NAME="1018"></A>not the women gathered there, exclaimed, "Sir stranger, from where I stand, 
<A NAME="1019"></A>I cannot clearly see the mock Bacchantes; but I will climb a hillock or 
<A NAME="1020"></A>a soaring pine whence to see clearly the shameful doings of the Bacchanals." 
<A NAME="1021"></A>Then and there I saw the stranger work a miracle; for catching a lofty 
<A NAME="1022"></A>fir-branch by the very end he drew it downward to the dusky earth, lower 
<A NAME="1023"></A>yet and ever lower; and like a bow it bent, or rounded wheel, whose curving 
<A NAME="1024"></A>circle grows complete, as chalk and line describe it; e'en so the stranger 
<A NAME="1025"></A>drew down the mountain-branch between his hands, bending it to earth, by 
<A NAME="1026"></A>more than human agency. And when he had seated Pentheus aloft on the pine 
<A NAME="1027"></A>branches, he let them slip through his hands gently, careful not to shake 
<A NAME="1028"></A>him from his seat. Up soared the branch straight into the air above, with 
<A NAME="1029"></A>my master perched thereon, seen by the Maenads better far than he saw them; 
<A NAME="1030"></A>for scarce was he beheld upon his lofty throne, when the stranger disappeared, 
<A NAME="1031"></A>while from the sky there came a voice, 'twould seem, by Dionysus 
<A NAME="1032"></A>uttered-
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR><BR>"Maidens, I bring the man who tried to mock you and me and my mystic 
<A NAME="1034"></A>rites; take vengeance on him." And as he spake he raised 'twixt heaven 
<A NAME="1035"></A>and earth a dazzling column of awful flame. Hushed grew the sky, and still 
<A NAME="1036"></A>hung each leaf throughout the grassy glen, nor couldst thou have heard 
<A NAME="1037"></A>one creature cry. But they, not sure of the voice they heard, sprang up 
<A NAME="1038"></A>and peered all round; then once again his bidding came; and when the daughters 
<A NAME="1039"></A>of Cadmus knew it was the Bacchic god in very truth that called, swift 
<A NAME="1040"></A>as doves they dirted off in cager haste, his mother Agave and her sisters 
<A NAME="1041"></A>dear and all the Bacchanals; through torrent glen, o'er boulders huge they 
<A NAME="1042"></A>bounded on, inspired with madness by the god. Soon as they saw my master 
<A NAME="1043"></A>perched upon the fir, they set to hurling stones at him with all their 
<A NAME="1044"></A>might, mounting a commanding eminence, and with pine-branches he was pelted 
<A NAME="1045"></A>as with darts; and others shot their wands through the air at Pentheus, 
<A NAME="1046"></A>their hapless target, but all to no purpose. For there he sat beyond the 
<A NAME="1047"></A>reach of their hot endeavours, a helpless, hopeless victim. At last they 
<A NAME="1048"></A>rent off limbs from oaks and were for prising up the roots with levers 
<A NAME="1049"></A>not of iron. But when they still could make no end to all their toil, Agave 
<A NAME="1050"></A>cried: "Come stand around, and grip the sapling trunk, my Bacchanals! that 
<A NAME="1051"></A>we may catch the beast that sits thereon, lest he divulge the secrets of 
<A NAME="1052"></A>our god's religion."
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR><BR>Then were a thousand hands laid on the fir, and from the ground 
<A NAME="1054"></A>they tore it up, while he from his seat aloft came tumbling to the ground 
<A NAME="1055"></A>with lamentations long and loud, e'en Pentheus; for well he knew his hour 
<A NAME="1056"></A>was come. His mother first, a priestess for the nonce, began the bloody 
<A NAME="1057"></A>deed and fell upon him; whereon he tore the snood from off his hair, that 
<A NAME="1058"></A>hapless Agave might recognize and spare him, crying as he touched her cheek, 
<A NAME="1059"></A>"O mother! it is I, thy own son Pentheus, the child thou didst bear in 
<A NAME="1060"></A>Echion's halls; have pity on me, mother dear! oh! do not for any sin of 
<A NAME="1061"></A>mine slay thy own son."
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR><BR>But she, the while, with foaming mouth and wildly rolling eyes, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>bereft of reason as she was, heeded him not; for the god possessed her. 
<A NAME="1064"></A>And she caught his left hand in her grip, and planting her foot upon her 
<A NAME="1065"></A>victim's trunk she tore the shoulder from its socket, not of her own strength, 
<A NAME="1066"></A>but the god made it an easy task to her hands; and Ino set to work upon 
<A NAME="1067"></A>the other side, rending the flesh with Autonoe and all the eager host of 
<A NAME="1068"></A>Bacchanals; and one united cry arose, the victim's groans while yet he 
<A NAME="1069"></A>breathed, and their triumphant shouts. One would make an arm her prey, 
<A NAME="1070"></A>another a foot with the sandal on it; and his ribs were stripped of flesh 
<A NAME="1071"></A>by their rending nails; and each one with blood-dabbled hands was tossing 
<A NAME="1072"></A>Pentheus' limbs about. Scattered lies his corpse, part beneath the rugged 
<A NAME="1073"></A>rocks, and part amid the deep dark woods, no easy task to find; but his 
<A NAME="1074"></A>poor head hath his mother made her own, and fixing it upon the point of 
<A NAME="1075"></A>a thyrsus, as it had been a mountain lion's, she bears it through the midst 
<A NAME="1076"></A>of Cithaeron, having left her sisters with the Maenads at their rites. 
<A NAME="1077"></A>And she is entering these walls exulting in her hunting fraught with woe, 
<A NAME="1078"></A>calling on the Bacchic god her fellow-hunter who had helped her to triumph 
<A NAME="1079"></A>in a chase, where her only prize was tears.
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR><BR>But I will get me hence, away from this piteous scene, before Agave
