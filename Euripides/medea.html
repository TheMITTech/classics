<A NAME="20"></A><B>NURSE</B>
<A NAME="21"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ah! Would to Heaven the good ship Argo ne'er had sped its course 
<A NAME="22"></A>to the Colchian land through the misty blue Symplegades, nor ever in the 
<A NAME="23"></A>glens of Pelion the pine been felled to furnish with oars the chieftain's 
<A NAME="24"></A>hands, who went to fetch the golden fleece for Pelias; for then would my 
<A NAME="25"></A>own mistress Medea never have sailed to the turrets of Iolcos, her soul 
<A NAME="26"></A>with love for Jason smitten, nor would she have beguiled the daughters 
<A NAME="27"></A>of Pelias to slay their father and come to live here in the land of Corinth 
<A NAME="28"></A>with her husband and children, where her exile found favour with the citizens 
<A NAME="29"></A>to whose land she had come, and in all things of her own accord was she 
<A NAME="30"></A>at one with Jason, the greatest safeguard this when wife and husband do 
<A NAME="31"></A>agree; but now their love is all turned to hate, and tenderest ties are 
<A NAME="32"></A>weak. For Jason hath betrayed his own children and my mistress dear for 
<A NAME="33"></A>the love of a royal bride, for he hath wedded the daughter of Creon, lord 
<A NAME="34"></A>of this land. While Medea, his hapless wife, thus scorned, appeals to the 
<A NAME="35"></A>oaths he swore, recalls the strong pledge his right hand gave, and bids 
<A NAME="36"></A>heaven be witness what requital she is finding from Jason. And here she 
<A NAME="37"></A>lies fasting, yielding her body to her grief, wasting away in tears ever 
<A NAME="38"></A>since she learnt that she was wronged by her husband, never lifting her 
<A NAME="39"></A>eye nor raising her face from off the ground; and she lends as deaf an 
<A NAME="40"></A>ear to her friend's warning as if she were a rock or ocean billow, save 
<A NAME="41"></A>when she turns her snow-white neck aside and softly to herself bemoans 
<A NAME="42"></A>her father dear, her country and her home, which she gave up to come hither 
<A NAME="43"></A>with the man who now holds her in dishonour. She, poor lady, hath by sad 
<A NAME="44"></A>experience learnt how good a thing it is never to quit one's native land. 
<A NAME="45"></A>And she hates her children now and feels no joy at seeing them; I fear 
<A NAME="46"></A>she may contrive some untoward scheme; for her mood is dangerous nor will 
<A NAME="47"></A>she brook her cruel treatment; full well I know her, and I much do dread 
<A NAME="48"></A>that she will plunge the keen sword through their hearts, stealing without 
<A NAME="49"></A>a word into the chamber where their marriage couch is spread, or else that 
<A NAME="50"></A>she will slay the prince and bridegroom too, and so find some calamity 
<A NAME="51"></A>still more grievous than the present; for dreadful is her wrath; verily 
<A NAME="52"></A>the man that doth incur her hate will have no easy task to raise o'er her 
<A NAME="53"></A>a song of triumph. Lo! where her sons come hither from their childish sports; 
<A NAME="54"></A>little they reck of their mother's woes, for the soul of the young is no 
<A NAME="55"></A>friend to sorrow. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="135"></A>Ah me! ah me! the pity of it! Why, pray, do thy children share their father's 
<A NAME="136"></A>crime? Why hatest thou them? Woe is you, poor children, how do I grieve 
<A NAME="137"></A>for you lest ye suffer some outrage! Strange are the tempers of princes, 
<A NAME="138"></A>and maybe because they seldom have to obey, and mostly lord it over others, 
<A NAME="139"></A>change they their moods with difficulty. 'Tis better then to have been 
<A NAME="140"></A>trained to live on equal terms. Be it mine to reach old age, not in proud 
<A NAME="141"></A>pomp, but in security! Moderation wins the day first as a better word for 
<A NAME="142"></A>men to use, and likewise it is far the best course for them to pursue; 
<A NAME="143"></A>but greatness that doth o'erreach itself, brings no blessing to mortal

<A NAME="163"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Didst hear, O Zeus, thou earth, and thou, O light, the piteous

<A NAME="165"></A>insatiate resting-place ever hasten for thee, poor reckless one, the end 
<A NAME="166"></A>that death alone can bring? Never pray for that. And if thy lord prefers 
<A NAME="167"></A>a fresh love, be not angered with him for that; Zeus will judge 'twixt

<A NAME="172"></A>Great Themis, and husband of Themis, behold what I am suffering now, though 
<A NAME="173"></A>I did bind that accursed one, my husband, by strong oaths to me! O, to 
<A NAME="174"></A>see him and his bride some day brought to utter destruction, they and their 
<A NAME="175"></A>house with them, for that they presume to wrong me thus unprovoked. O my

<A NAME="185"></A>fury of her wrath, and her temper stern. Never be my zeal at any rate denied 
<A NAME="186"></A>my friends! But go thou and bring her hither outside the house, and tell 
<A NAME="187"></A>her this our friendly thought; haste thee ere she do some mischief to those 
<A NAME="188"></A>inside the house, for this sorrow of hers is mounting high. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="190"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>This will I do; but I doubt whether I shall persuade my mistress;

<A NAME="192"></A>upon her servants with the look of a lioness with cubs, whenso anyone draws 
<A NAME="193"></A>nigh to speak to her. Wert thou to call the men of old time rude uncultured 
<A NAME="194"></A>boors thou wouldst not err, seeing that they devised their hymns for festive 
<A NAME="195"></A>occasions, for banquets, and to grace the board, a pleasure to catch the 
<A NAME="196"></A>ear, shed o'er our life, but no man hath found a way to allay hated grief 
<A NAME="197"></A>by music and the minstrel's varied strain, whence arise slaughters and 
<A NAME="198"></A>fell strokes of fate to o'erthrow the homes of men. And yet this were surely 
<A NAME="199"></A>a gain, to heal men's wounds by music's spell, but why tune they their 
<A NAME="200"></A>idle song where rich banquets are spread? For of itself doth the rich banquet,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="210"></A><B>MEDEA</B>
<A NAME="211"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>From the house I have come forth, Corinthian ladies, for fear 
<A NAME="212"></A>lest you be blaming me; for well I know that amongst men many by showing 
<A NAME="213"></A>pride have gotten them an ill name and a reputation for indifference, both 
<A NAME="214"></A>those who shun men's gaze and those who move amid the stranger crowd, and 
<A NAME="215"></A>likewise they who choose a quiet walk in life. For there is no just discernment 
<A NAME="216"></A>in the eyes of men, for they, or ever they have surely learnt their neighbour's 
<A NAME="217"></A>heart, loathe him at first sight, though never wronged by him; and so a 
<A NAME="218"></A>stranger most of all should adopt a city's views; nor do I commend that 
<A NAME="219"></A>citizen, who, in the stubbornness of his heart, from churlishness resents 
<A NAME="220"></A>the city's will.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>But on me hath fallen this unforeseen disaster, and sapped my life; 
<A NAME="222"></A>ruined I am, and long to resign the boon of existence, kind friends, and 
<A NAME="223"></A>die. For he who was all the world to me, as well thou knowest, hath turned 
<A NAME="224"></A>out the worst of men, my own husband. Of all things that have life and 
<A NAME="225"></A>sense we women are the most hapless creatures; first must we buy a husband 
<A NAME="226"></A>at a great price, and o'er ourselves a tyrant set which is an evil worse 
<A NAME="227"></A>than the first; and herein lies the most important issue, whether our choice 
<A NAME="228"></A>be good or bad. For divorce is not honourable to women, nor can we disown 
<A NAME="229"></A>our lords. Next must the wife, coming as she does to ways and customs new, 
<A NAME="230"></A>since she hath not learnt the lesson in her home, have a diviner's eye 
<A NAME="231"></A>to see how best to treat the partner of her life. If haply we perform these 
<A NAME="232"></A>tasks with thoroughness and tact, and the husband live with us, without 
<A NAME="233"></A>resenting the yoke, our life is a happy one; if not, 'twere best to die. 
<A NAME="234"></A>But when a man is vexed with what he finds indoors, he goeth forth and 
<A NAME="235"></A>rids his soul of its disgust, betaking him to some friend or comrade of 
<A NAME="236"></A>like age; whilst we must needs regard his single self.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>And yet they say we live secure at home, while they are at the 
<A NAME="238"></A>wars, with their sorry reasoning, for I would gladly take my stand in battle 
<A NAME="239"></A>array three times o'er, than once give birth. But enough! this language 
<A NAME="240"></A>suits not thee as it does me; thou hast a city here, a father's house, 
<A NAME="241"></A>some joy in life, and friends to share thy thoughts, but I am destitute, 
<A NAME="242"></A>without a city, and therefore scorned by my husband, a captive I from a 
<A NAME="243"></A>foreign shore, with no mother, brother, or kinsman in whom to find a new 
<A NAME="244"></A>haven of refuge from this calamity. Wherefore this one boon and only this 
<A NAME="245"></A>I wish to win from thee,-thy silence, if haply I can some way or means

<A NAME="437"></A>to come; for I shall ease my soul by reviling thee, and thou wilt be vexed 
<A NAME="438"></A>at my recital. I will begin at the very beginning. I saved thy life, as

<A NAME="440"></A>thou wert sent to tame and yoke fire-breathing bulls, and to sow the deadly

<A NAME="442"></A>sleepless watch o'er it with many a wreathed coil, and I raised for thee 
<A NAME="443"></A>a beacon of deliverance. Father and home of my free will I left and came 
<A NAME="444"></A>with the to Iolcos, 'neath Pelion's hills, for my love was stronger than 
<A NAME="445"></A>my prudence. Next I caused the death of Pelias by a doom most grievous, 
<A NAME="446"></A>even by his own children's hand, beguiling them of all their fear. All 
<A NAME="447"></A>this have I done for thee, thou traitor! and thou hast cast me over, taking 
<A NAME="448"></A>to thyself another wife, though children have been born to us. Hadst thou 
<A NAME="449"></A>been childless still, I could have pardoned thy desire for this new union. 
<A NAME="450"></A>Gone is now the trust I put in oaths. I cannot even understand whether 
<A NAME="451"></A>thou thinkest that the gods of old no longer rule, or that fresh decrees 
<A NAME="452"></A>are now in vogue amongst mankind, for thy conscience must tell thee thou 
<A NAME="453"></A>hast not kept faith with me. Ah! poor right hand, which thou didst often 
<A NAME="454"></A>grasp. These knees thou didst embrace! All in vain, I suffered a traitor 
<A NAME="455"></A>to touch me! How short of my hopes I am fallen! But come, I will deal with 
<A NAME="456"></A>the as though thou wert my friend. Yet what kindness can I expect from 
<A NAME="457"></A>one so base as thee? But yet I will do it, for my questioning will show 
<A NAME="458"></A>thee yet more base. Whither can I turn me now? to my father's house, to 
<A NAME="459"></A>my own country, which I for thee deserted to come hither? to the hapless 
<A NAME="460"></A>daughters of Pelias? A glad welcome, I trow, would they give me in their

<A NAME="778"></A>I will leave the land, escaping punishment for my dear children's murder,

<A NAME="781"></A>left. O, I did wrong, that hour I left my father's home, persuaded by that

<A NAME="1108"></A>hair at her bright mirror, with many a happy smile at her breathless counterfeit. 
<A NAME="1109"></A>Then rising from her seat she passed across the chamber, tripping lightly 
<A NAME="1110"></A>on her fair white foot, exulting in the gift, with many a glance at her 
<A NAME="1111"></A>uplifted ankle. When lo! a scene of awful horror did ensue. In a moment 
<A NAME="1112"></A>she turned pale, reeled backwards, trembling in every limb, and sinks upon 
<A NAME="1113"></A>a seat scarce soon enough to save herself from falling to the ground. An 
<A NAME="1114"></A>aged dame, one of her company, thinking belike it was a fit from Pan or 
<A NAME="1115"></A>some god sent, raised a cry of prayer, till from her mouth she saw the 
<A NAME="1116"></A>foam-flakes issue, her eyeballs rolling in their sockets, and all the blood 
<A NAME="1117"></A>her face desert; then did she raise a loud scream far different from her 
<A NAME="1118"></A>former cry. Forthwith one handmaid rushed to her father's house, another 
<A NAME="1119"></A>to her new bridegroom to tell his bride's sad fate, and the whole house 
<A NAME="1120"></A>echoed with their running to and fro. By this time would a quick walker 
<A NAME="1121"></A>have made the turn in a course of six plethra and reached the goal, when 
<A NAME="1122"></A>she with one awful shriek awoke, poor sufferer, from her speechless trance 
<A NAME="1123"></A>and oped her closed eyes, for against her a twofold anguish was warring. 
<A NAME="1124"></A>The chaplet of gold about her head was sending forth a wondrous stream 
<A NAME="1125"></A>of ravening flame, while the fine raiment, thy children's gift, was preying 
<A NAME="1126"></A>on the hapless maiden's fair white flesh; and she starts from her seat 
<A NAME="1127"></A>in a blaze and seeks to fly, shaking her hair and head this way and that, 
<A NAME="1128"></A>to cast the crown therefrom; but the gold held firm to its fastenings, 
<A NAME="1129"></A>and the flame, as she shook her locks, blazed forth the more with double 
<A NAME="1130"></A>fury. Then to the earth she sinks, by the cruel blow o'ercome; past all 
<A NAME="1131"></A>recognition now save to a father's eye; for her eyes had lost their tranquil 
<A NAME="1132"></A>gaze, her face no more its natural look preserved, and from the crown of 
<A NAME="1133"></A>her head blood and fire in mingled stream ran down; and from her bones 
<A NAME="1134"></A>the flesh kept peeling off beneath the gnawing of those secret drugs, e'en 
<A NAME="1135"></A>as when the pine-tree weeps its tears of pitch, a fearsome sight to see. 
<A NAME="1136"></A>And all were afraid to touch the corpse, for we were warned by what had 
<A NAME="1137"></A>chanced. Anon came her haples father unto the house, all unwitting of her 
<A NAME="1138"></A>doom, and stumbles o'er the dead, and loud he cried, and folding his arms 
<A NAME="1139"></A>about her kissed her, with words like these the while, "O my poor, poor 
<A NAME="1140"></A>child, which of the gods hath destroyed thee thus foully? Who is robbing 
<A NAME="1141"></A>me of thee, old as I am and ripe for death? O my child, alas! would I could 
<A NAME="1142"></A>die with thee!" He ceased his sad lament, and would have raised his aged 
<A NAME="1143"></A>frame, but found himself held fast by the fine-spun robe as ivy that clings 
<A NAME="1144"></A>to the branches of the bay, and then ensued a fearful struggle. He strove 
<A NAME="1145"></A>to rise, but she still held him back; and if ever he pulled with all his 
<A NAME="1146"></A>might, from off his bones his aged flesh he tore. At last he gave it up, 
<A NAME="1147"></A>and breathed forth his soul in awful suffering; for he could no longer 
<A NAME="1148"></A>master the pain. So there they lie, daughter and aged sire, dead side by 
<A NAME="1149"></A>side, a grievous sight that calls for tears. And as for thee, I leave thee 
<A NAME="1150"></A>out of my consideration, for thyself must discover a means to escape punishment. 
<A NAME="1151"></A>Not now for the first time I think this human life a shadow; yea, and without 
<A NAME="1152"></A>shrinking I will say that they amongst men who pretend to wisdom and expend 
<A NAME="1153"></A>deep thought on words do incur a serious charge of folly; for amongst mortals 
<A NAME="1154"></A>no man is happy; wealth may pour in and make one luckier than another, 
<A NAME="1155"></A>but none can happy be. </BLOCKQUOTE>
