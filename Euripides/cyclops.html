<A NAME="16"></A><B>SILENUS</B>
<A NAME="17"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>O Bromius, unnumbered are the toils I bear because of thee, 
<A NAME="18"></A>no less now than when I was young and hale; first, when thou wert driven 
<A NAME="19"></A>mad by Hera and didst leave the mountain nymphs, thy nurses; next, when 
<A NAME="20"></A>in battle with earth-born spearmen I stood beside thee on the right as 
<A NAME="21"></A>squire, and slew Enceladus, smiting him full in the middle of his targe 
<A NAME="22"></A>with my spear. Come, though, let me see; must I confess 'twas all a dream? 
<A NAME="23"></A>No, by Zeus! since I really showed his spoils to the Bacchic god. And now 
<A NAME="24"></A>am I enduring to the full a toil still worse than those. For when Hera 
<A NAME="25"></A>sent forth a race of Tyrrhene pirates against thee, that thou mightest 
<A NAME="26"></A>be smuggled far away, I, as soon as the news reached me, sailed in quest 
<A NAME="27"></A>of thee with my children; and, taking the helm myself, I stood on the end 
<A NAME="28"></A>of the stern and steered our trim craft; and my sons, sitting at the oars, 
<A NAME="29"></A>made the grey billows froth and foam as they sought thee, my liege, But 
<A NAME="30"></A>just as we had come nigh Malea in our course, an east wind blew upon the 
<A NAME="31"></A>ship and drove us hither to the rock of Aetna, where in lonely caverns 
<A NAME="32"></A>dwell the one-eyed children of ocean's god, the murdering Cyclopes. Captured 
<A NAME="33"></A>by one of them we are slaves in his house; Polyphemus they call him whom 
<A NAME="34"></A>we serve; and instead of Bacchic revelry we are herding a godless Cyclops's 
<A NAME="35"></A>flocks; and so it is my children, striplings as they are, tend the young 
<A NAME="36"></A>thereof on the edge of the downs; while my appointed task is to stay here 
<A NAME="37"></A>and fill the troughs and sweep out the cave, or wait upon the ungodly Cyclops 
<A NAME="38"></A>at his impious feasts. His orders now compel obedience; I have to scrape 
<A NAME="39"></A>out his house with the rake you see, so as to receive the Cyclops, my absent 
<A NAME="40"></A>master, and his sheep in clean caverns.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>But already I see my children driving their browsing flocks towards 
<A NAME="42"></A>me.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>What means this? is the beat of feet in the Sicinnis dance the 
<A NAME="44"></A>same to you now as when ye attended the Bacchic god in his revelries and 
<A NAME="45"></A>made your way with dainty steps to the music of lyres to the halls of Althaea? 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="51"></A>Offspring of well-bred sires and dams, pray whither wilt thou be gone from 
<A NAME="52"></A>me to the rocks? Hast thou not here a gentle breeze, and grass to browse, 
<A NAME="53"></A>and water from the eddying stream set near the cave in troughs? and are 
<A NAME="54"></A>not thy young ones bleating for thee? Pst! pst! wilt thou not browse here, 
<A NAME="55"></A>here on the dewy slope? Ho! ho ere long will I cast a stone at thee. Away, 
<A NAME="56"></A>away! O horned one, to the fold-keeper of the Cyclops, the country-ranging 
<A NAME="57"></A>shepherd. <BR><BR><I>antistrophe</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="58"></A>Loosen thy bursting udder; welcome to thy teats the kids, whom thou leavest 
<A NAME="59"></A>in the lambkins' pens. Those little bleating kids, asleep the livelong 
<A NAME="60"></A>day, miss thee; wilt then leave at last the rich grass pastures on the 
<A NAME="61"></A>peaks of Aetna and enter the fold?... <BR><BR><I>epode</I><BR><BR>
<A NAME="62"></A>Here we have no Bromian god; no dances here, or Bacchantes thyrsus-bearing; 
<A NAME="63"></A>no roll of drums, or drops of sparkling wine by gurgling founts; nor is 
<A NAME="64"></A>it now with Nymphs in Nysa I sing a song of Bacchus, Bacchus! to the queen 
<A NAME="65"></A>of love, in quest of whom I once sped on with Bacchantes, white of foot. 
<A NAME="66"></A>Dear friend, dear Bacchic god, whither art roaming alone, waving thy auburn 
<A NAME="67"></A>locks, while I, thy minister, do service to the one-eyed Cyclops, a slave 
<A NAME="68"></A>and wanderer I, clad in this wretched goat-skin dress, severed from thy

<A NAME="79"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I see the hull of a ship from Hellas at the shore, and men,

<A NAME="81"></A>their necks they carry empty vessels and pitchers for water; they are in 
<A NAME="82"></A>want of food. Luckless strangers! who can they be? They know not what manner 
<A NAME="83"></A>of man our master Polyphemus is, to have set foot here in his cheerless 
<A NAME="84"></A>abode and come to the jaws of the cannibal Cyclops in an evil hour. But 
<A NAME="85"></A>hold ye your peace, that we may inquire whence they come to the peak of

<A NAME="92"></A>mariners in need.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>Why, what is this? We seem to have chanced upon a city of the Bromian

<A NAME="187"></A><B>SILENUS</B>
<A NAME="188"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Why, that would not give me so much as a mouthful. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="189"></A><B>ODYSSEUS</B>
<A NAME="190"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>This, and twice as much again as will run from the skin.

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="195"></A><B>SILENUS</B>
<A NAME="196"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>A reasonable offer; for of a truth a taste invites the purchase.

<A NAME="228"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I will do so, with small thought of any master. For let me

<A NAME="231"></A>the Leucadian rock, once I have been well drunk and smoothed out my wrinkled 
<A NAME="232"></A>brow. For if a man rejoice not in his drinking, he is mad; for in drinking 
<A NAME="233"></A>it's possible for this to stand up straight, and then to fondle breasts, 
<A NAME="234"></A>and to caress well tended locks, and there is dancing withal, and oblivion 
<A NAME="235"></A>of woe. Shall not I then purchase so rare a drink, bidding the senseless

<A NAME="463"></A><B>ODYSSEUS</B>
<A NAME="464"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>When we had entered yonder rocky abode, he lighted first a 
<A NAME="465"></A>fire, throwing logs of towering oak upon his spacious hearth, enough for 
<A NAME="466"></A>three wagons to carry as their load; next, close by the blazing flame, 
<A NAME="467"></A>he placed his couch of pine-boughs laid upon the floor, and filled a bowl 
<A NAME="468"></A>of some ten firkins, pouring white milk thereinto, after he had milked 
<A NAME="469"></A>his kine; and by his side he put a can of ivy-wood, whose breadth was three 
<A NAME="470"></A>cubits and its depth four maybe; next he set his brazen pot a-boiling on 
<A NAME="471"></A>the fire, spits too he set beside him, fashioned of the branches of thorn, 
<A NAME="472"></A>their points hardened in the fire and the rest of them trimmed with the 
<A NAME="473"></A>hatchet, and the blood-bowls of Aetna for the axe's edge. Now when that 
<A NAME="474"></A>hell-cook, god-detested, had everything quite ready, he caught up a pair 
<A NAME="475"></A>of my companions and proceeded deliberately to cut the throat of one of 
<A NAME="476"></A>them over the yawning brazen pot; but the other he clutched by the tendon 
<A NAME="477"></A>of his heel, and, striking him against a sharp point of rocky stone, dashed 
<A NAME="478"></A>out his brains; then, after hacking the fleshy parts with glutton cleaver, 
<A NAME="479"></A>he set to grilling them, but the limbs he threw into his cauldron to seethe. 
<A NAME="480"></A>And I, poor wretch, drew near with streaming eyes and waited on the Cyclops; 
<A NAME="481"></A>but the others kept cowering like frightened birds in crannies of the rock, 
<A NAME="482"></A>and the blood forsook their skin. Anon, when he had gorged himself upon 
<A NAME="483"></A>my comrades' flesh and had fallen on his back, breathing heavily, there 
<A NAME="484"></A>came a sudden inspiration to me. I filled a cup of this Maronian wine and 
<A NAME="485"></A>offered him a draught, saying, "Cyclops, son of Ocean's god, see here what 
<A NAME="486"></A>heavenly drink the grapes of Hellas yield, glad gift of Dionysus." He, 
<A NAME="487"></A>glutted with his shameless meal, took and drained it at one draught, and, 
<A NAME="488"></A>lifting up his hand, he thanked me thus "Dearest to me of all my guests! 
<A NAME="489"></A>fair the drink thou givest me to crown so fair a feast." Now when I saw 
<A NAME="490"></A>his delight, I gave him another cup, knowing the wine would make him rue 
<A NAME="491"></A>it, and he would soon be paying the penalty. Then he set to singing; but 
<A NAME="492"></A>I kept filling bumper after bumper and heating him with drink. So there 
<A NAME="493"></A>he is singing discordantly amid the weeping of my fellow-sailors, and the 
<A NAME="494"></A>cave re-echoes; but I have made my way out quietly and would fain save 
<A NAME="495"></A>thee and myself, if thou wilt. Tell me then, is it your wish, or is it 
<A NAME="496"></A>not, to fly from this unsocial wretch and take up your abode with Naiad 
<A NAME="497"></A>nymphs in the halls of the Bacchic god? Thy father within approves this 
<A NAME="498"></A>scheme; but there! he is powerless, getting all he can out of his liquor; 
<A NAME="499"></A>his wings are snared by the cup as if he had flown against bird-lime, and 
<A NAME="500"></A>he is fuddled; but thou art young and lusty; so save thyself with my help
