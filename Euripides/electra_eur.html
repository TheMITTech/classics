<A NAME="21"></A><B>PEASANT</B>
<A NAME="22"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>O Argos, ancient land, and streams of Inachus, whence on a 
<A NAME="23"></A>day king Agamemnon sailed to the realm of Troy, carrying his warriors aboard 
<A NAME="24"></A>a thousand ships; and after he had slain Priam who was reigning in Ilium 
<A NAME="25"></A>and captured the famous city of Dardanus, he came hither to Argos and has 
<A NAME="26"></A>set up high on the temple-walls many a trophy, spoil of the barbarians. 
<A NAME="27"></A>Though all went well with him in Troy, yet was he slain in his own palace 
<A NAME="28"></A>by the guile of his wife Clytemnestra and the hand of Aegisthus, son of 
<A NAME="29"></A>Thyestes. So he died and left behind him the ancient sceptre of Tantalus, 
<A NAME="30"></A>and Aegisthus reigns in his stead, with the daughter of Tyndareus, Agamemnon's 
<A NAME="31"></A>queen, to wife. Now as for those whom he left in his halls, when he sailed 
<A NAME="32"></A>to Troy, his son Orestes and his tender daughter Electra,-the boy Orestes, 
<A NAME="33"></A>as he was like to be slain by Aegisthus, his sire's old foster-father secretly 
<A NAME="34"></A>removed to the land of Phocis and gave to Strophius to bring up, but the 
<A NAME="35"></A>maid Electra abode in her father's house, and soon as she had budded into 
<A NAME="36"></A>maidenhood, came all the princes of Hellas asking her hand in marriage. 
<A NAME="37"></A>But Aegisthus kept her at home for fear she might bear a son to some chieftain 
<A NAME="38"></A>who would avenge Agamemnon, nor would he betroth her unto any. But when 
<A NAME="39"></A>e'en thus there seemed some room for fear that she might bear some noble 
<A NAME="40"></A>lord a child by stealth and Aegisthus was minded to slay her, her mother, 
<A NAME="41"></A>though she had a cruel heart, yet rescued the maiden from his hand. For 
<A NAME="42"></A>she could find excuses for having slain her husband, but she feared the 
<A NAME="43"></A>hatred she would incur for her children's murder. Wherefore Aegisthus devised 
<A NAME="44"></A>this scheme; on Agamemnon's son who had escaped his realm by flight he 
<A NAME="45"></A>set a price to be paid to any who should slay him, while he gave Electra 
<A NAME="46"></A>to me in marriage, whose ancestors were citizens of Mycenae. It is not 
<A NAME="47"></A>that I blame myself for; my family was noble enough, though certainly impoverished, 
<A NAME="48"></A>and so my good birth suffers. By making for her this weak alliance he thought 
<A NAME="49"></A>he would have little to fear. For if some man of high position had married 
<A NAME="50"></A>her, he might have revived the vengeance for Agamemnon's murder, which 
<A NAME="51"></A>now is sleeping; in which case Aegisthus would have paid the penalty. But 
<A NAME="52"></A>Cypris is my witness that I have ever respected her maidenhood; she is 
<A NAME="53"></A>still as though unwed. Unworthy as I am, honour forbids that I should so 
<A NAME="54"></A>affront the daughter of a better man. Yea, and I am sorry for Orestes, 
<A NAME="55"></A>hapless youth, who is called my kinsman, to think that he should ever return 
<A NAME="56"></A>to Argos and behold his sister's wretched marriage. And whoso counts me 
<A NAME="57"></A>but a fool for leaving a tender maid untouched when I have her in my house, 
<A NAME="58"></A>to him I say, he measures purity by the vicious standard of his own soul, 
<A NAME="59"></A>a standard like himself. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="62"></A><B>ELECTRA</B>
<A NAME="63"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>O sable night, nurse of the golden stars! beneath thy pall 
<A NAME="64"></A>I go to fetch water from the brook with my pitcher poised upon my head, 
<A NAME="65"></A>not indeed because I am forced to this necessity, but that to the gods 
<A NAME="66"></A>I may display the affronts Aegisthus puts upon me, and to the wide firmament 
<A NAME="67"></A>pour out my lamentation for my sire. For my own mother, the baleful daughter 
<A NAME="68"></A>of Tyndareus, hath cast me forth from her house to gratify her lord; for 
<A NAME="69"></A>since she hath borne other children to Aegisthus she puts me and Orestes 
<A NAME="70"></A>on one side at home. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="71"></A><B>PEASANT</B>
<A NAME="72"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Oh! why, poor maiden, dost thou toil so hard on my behalf, 
<A NAME="73"></A>thou that aforetime wert reared so daintily? why canst thou not forego 
<A NAME="74"></A>thy labour, as I bid thee? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="75"></A><B>ELECTRA</B>
<A NAME="76"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>As a god's I count thy kindness to me, for in my distress thou 
<A NAME="77"></A>hast never made a mock at me. 'Tis rare fortune when mortals find such 
<A NAME="78"></A>healing balm for their cruel wounds as 'tis my lot to find in thee. Wherefore 
<A NAME="79"></A>I ought, though thou forbid me, to lighten thy labours, as far as my strength 
<A NAME="80"></A>allows, and share all burdens with thee to ease thy load. Thou hast enough 
<A NAME="81"></A>to do abroad; 'tis only right that I should keep thy house in order. For 
<A NAME="82"></A>when the toiler cometh to his home from the field, it is pleasant to find 
<A NAME="83"></A>all comfortable in the house. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="84"></A><B>PEASANT</B>
<A NAME="85"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>If such thy pleasure, go thy way; for, after all, the spring 
<A NAME="86"></A>is no great distance from my house. And at break of day I will drive my 
<A NAME="87"></A>steers to my glebe and sow my crop. For no idler, though he has the gods' 
<A NAME="88"></A>names ever on his lips, can gather a livelihood without hard work.

<A NAME="91"></A><B>ORESTES</B>
<A NAME="92"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Ah Pylades, I put thee first 'mongst men for thy love, thy 
<A NAME="93"></A>loyalty and friendliness to me; for thou alone of all my friends wouldst 
<A NAME="94"></A>still honour poor Orestes, in spite of the grievous plight whereto I am 
<A NAME="95"></A>reduced by Aegisthus, who with my accursed mother's aid slew my sire. I 
<A NAME="96"></A>am come from Apollo's mystic shrine to the soil of Argos, without the knowledge 
<A NAME="97"></A>of any, to avenge my father's death upon his murderers. Last night went 
<A NAME="98"></A>unto his tomb and wept thereon, cutting off my hair as an offering and 
<A NAME="99"></A>pouring o'er the grave the blood of a sheep for sacrifice, unmarked by 
<A NAME="100"></A>those who lord it o'er this land. And now though I enter not the walled 
<A NAME="101"></A>town, yet by coming to the borders of the land I combine two objects; I 
<A NAME="102"></A>can escape to another country if any spy me out and recognize me, and at 
<A NAME="103"></A>the same time seek my sister, for I am told she is a maid no longer but 
<A NAME="104"></A>is married and living here, that I may meet her, and, after enlisting her 
<A NAME="105"></A>aid in the deed of blood, learn for certain what is happening in the town. 
<A NAME="106"></A>Let us now, since dawn is uplifting her radiant eye, step aside from this 
<A NAME="107"></A>path. For maybe some labouring man or serving maid will come in sight, 
<A NAME="108"></A>of whom we may inquire whether it is here that my sister hath her home. 
<A NAME="109"></A>Lo! yonder I see a servant bearing a full pitcher of water on her shaven 
<A NAME="110"></A>head; let us sit down and make inquiry of this bond-maid, if haply we may 
<A NAME="111"></A>glean some tidings of the matter which brought us hither, Pylades.

<A NAME="120"></A>Ah me! for my cruel lot, my hateful existence! O my father Agamemnon! in 
<A NAME="121"></A>Hades art thou laid, butchered by thy wife and Aegisthus. Come, raise with

<A NAME="126"></A>the halls of our fathers to drain the cup of bitterness? Oh! come, great

<A NAME="130"></A>Take this pitcher from my head, put it down, that I may wake betimes, while 
<A NAME="131"></A>it is yet night, my lamentation for my sire, my doleful chant, my dirge 
<A NAME="132"></A>of death, for thee, my father in thy grave, which day by day I do rehearse, 
<A NAME="133"></A>rending my skin with my nails, and smiting on my shaven head in mourning 
<A NAME="134"></A>for thy death. Woe, woe! rend the cheek; like a swan with clear loud note 
<A NAME="135"></A>beside the brimming river calling to its parent dear that lies a-dying

<A NAME="138"></A>After that last fatal bath of thine laid out most piteously in death. Oh 
<A NAME="139"></A>I the horror of that axe which hacked thee so cruelly, my sire I oh! the 
<A NAME="140"></A>bitter thought that prompted thy return from Troy! With no garlands or 
<A NAME="141"></A>victor's crowns did thy wife welcome thee, but with his two-edged sword 
<A NAME="142"></A>she made thee the sad sport of Aegisthus and kept her treacherous paramour.

<A NAME="353"></A>whom they betrothed me before he joined the heavenly host, for I was his 
<A NAME="354"></A>kinswoman. Meantime my mother, 'mid the spoils of Troy, is seated on her

<A NAME="356"></A>of my father's spear, whose Trojan robes are fastened with brooches of 
<A NAME="357"></A>gold. And there on the wall my father's blood still leaves a deep dark 
<A NAME="358"></A>stain, while his murderer mounts the dead man's car and fareth forth, proudly 
<A NAME="359"></A>grasping in his blood-stained hands the sceptre with which Agamemnon would 
<A NAME="360"></A>marshal the sons of Hellas. Dishonoured lies his grave; naught as yet hath 
<A NAME="361"></A>it received of drink outpoured or myrtle-spray, but bare of ornament his 
<A NAME="362"></A>tomb is left. Yea, and 'tis said that noble hero who is wedded to my mother, 
<A NAME="363"></A>in his drunken fits, doth leap upon the grave, and pelt with stones my 
<A NAME="364"></A>father's monument, boldly gibing at us on this wise, "Where is thy son 
<A NAME="365"></A>Orestes? Is he ever coming in his glory to defend thy tomb?" Thus is Orestes 
<A NAME="366"></A>flouted behind his back. Oh! tell him this, kind sir, I pray thee. And 
<A NAME="367"></A>there be many calling him to come,-I am but their mouthpiece,-these suppliant 
<A NAME="368"></A>hands, this tongue, my broken heart, my shaven head, and his own father 
<A NAME="369"></A>too. For 'tis shameful that the sire should have destroyed Troy's race 
<A NAME="370"></A>and the son yet prove too weak to pit himself against one foe unto the

<A NAME="420"></A>necessity. To martial prowess must I turn? But who could pronounce who 
<A NAME="421"></A>is the valiant man merely from the look of his spear? Better is it to leave 
<A NAME="422"></A>these matters to themselves without troubling. For here is a man of no 
<A NAME="423"></A>account in Argos, with no family reputation to boast, one of the common 
<A NAME="424"></A>herd, proved a very hero. A truce to your folly! ye self-deceivers, swollen

<A NAME="882"></A><B>MESSENGER</B>
<A NAME="883"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>After we had set out from this house, we struck into the broad 
<A NAME="884"></A>highroad, and came to the place where was the far-famed King of Mycenae. 
<A NAME="885"></A>Now he was walking in a garden well-watered, culling a wreath of tender 
<A NAME="886"></A>myrtle-sprays for his head, and when he saw us, he called out, "All hail! 
<A NAME="887"></A>strangers; who are ye? whence come ye? from what country?" To him Orestes 
<A NAME="888"></A>answered, "We are from Thessaly, on our way to Alpheus' banks to sacrifice 
<A NAME="889"></A>to Olympian Zeus." When Aegisthus heard that, he said, "Ye must be my guests 
<A NAME="890"></A>to-day, and share the feast, for I am even now sacrificing to the Nymphs; 
<A NAME="891"></A>and by rising with tomorrow's light ye will be just as far upon your journey; 
<A NAME="892"></A>now let us go within." Therewith he caught us by the hand and led us by 
<A NAME="893"></A>the way; refuse we could not; and when we were come to the house, he gave 
<A NAME="894"></A>command: "Bring water for my guests to wash forthwith, that they may stand 
<A NAME="895"></A>around the altar near the laver." But Orestes answered, "'Twas but now 
<A NAME="896"></A>we purified ourselves and washed us clean in water from the river. So if 
<A NAME="897"></A>we strangers are to join your citizens in sacrifice, we are ready, King 
<A NAME="898"></A>Aegisthus, and will not refuse." So ended they their private conference. 
<A NAME="899"></A>Meantime the servants, that composed their master's bodyguard, laid aside 
<A NAME="900"></A>their weapons, and one and all were busied at their tasks. Some brought 
<A NAME="901"></A>the bowl to catch the blood, others took up baskets, while others kindled 
<A NAME="902"></A>fire and set cauldrons round about the altars, and the whole house rang. 
<A NAME="903"></A>Then did thy mother's husband take the barley for sprinkling, and began 
<A NAME="904"></A>casting it upon the hearth with these words, "Ye Nymphs, who dwell among 
<A NAME="905"></A>the rocks, grant that I may often sacrifice with my wife, the daughter 
<A NAME="906"></A>of Tyndareus, within my halls, as happily as now, and ruin seize my foes!" 
<A NAME="907"></A> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="908"></A><I>whereby he meant Orestes and thyself</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="909"></A>. But my master, lowering his voice, offered a different prayer, that he 
<A NAME="910"></A>might regain his father's house. Next Aegisthus took from basket a long 
<A NAME="911"></A>straight knife, and cutting off some of the calf's hair, laid it with his 
<A NAME="912"></A>right hand on the sacred fire, and then cut its throat when the servants 
<A NAME="913"></A>had lifted it upon their shoulders, and thus addressed thy brother; "Men 
<A NAME="914"></A>declare that amongst the Thessalians this is counted honourable, to cut 
<A NAME="915"></A>up a bull neatly and to manage steeds. So take the knife, sir stranger, 
<A NAME="916"></A>and show us if rumour speaks true about the Thessalians." Thereon Orestes 
<A NAME="917"></A>seized the Dorian knife of tempered steel and cast from his shoulders his 
<A NAME="918"></A>graceful buckled robe; then choosing Pylades to help him in his task, he 
<A NAME="919"></A>made the servants withdraw, and catching the calf by the hoof, proceeded 
<A NAME="920"></A>to lay bare its white flesh, with arm outstretched, and he flayed the hide 
<A NAME="921"></A>quicker than a runner ever finishes the two laps of the horses' race-course; 
<A NAME="922"></A>next he laid the belly open, and Aegisthus took the entrails in his hands 
<A NAME="923"></A>and carefully examined them. Now the liver had no lobe, while the portal 
<A NAME="924"></A>vein leading to the gall-bladder portended dangerous attack on him who 
<A NAME="925"></A>was observing it. Dark grows Aegisthus' brow, but my master asks, "Why 
<A NAME="926"></A>so despondent, good sir?" Said he, "I fear treachery from a stranger. Agamemnon's 
<A NAME="927"></A>son of all men most I hate, and he hates my house." But Orestes cried, 
<A NAME="928"></A>"What! fear treachery from an exile! thou the ruler of the city? Ho! take 
<A NAME="929"></A>this Dorian knife away and bring me a Thessalian cleaver, that we by sacrificial 
<A NAME="930"></A>feast may learn the will of heaven; let me cleave the breast-bone." And 
<A NAME="931"></A>he took the axe and cut it through. Now Aegisthus was examining the entrails, 
<A NAME="932"></A>separating them in his hands, and as he was bending down, thy brother rose 
<A NAME="933"></A>on tiptoe and smote him on the spine, severing the bones of his back; and 
<A NAME="934"></A>his body gave one convulsive shudder from head to foot and writhed in the 
<A NAME="935"></A>death-agony. No sooner did his servants see it, than they rushed to arms, 
<A NAME="936"></A>a host to fight with two; yet did Pylades and Orestes of their valiancy 
<A NAME="937"></A>meet them with brandished spears. Then cried Orestes, "I am no foe that 
<A NAME="938"></A>come against this city and my own servants, but I have avenged me on the 
<A NAME="939"></A>murderer of my sire, I, ill-starred Orestes. Slay me not, my father's former 
<A NAME="940"></A>thralls!" They, when they heard him speak, restrained their spears, and 
<A NAME="941"></A>an old man, who had been in the family many a long year, recognized him. 
<A NAME="942"></A>Forthwith they crown thy brother with a wreath, and utter shouts of joy. 
<A NAME="943"></A>And lo! he is coming to show thee the head, not the Gorgon's, but the head 
<A NAME="944"></A>of thy hated foe Aegisthus; his death today has paid in blood a bitter

<A NAME="1003"></A>I were freed from my old terrors; and now I am; so I will pay thee back 
<A NAME="1004"></A>with the abuse I fain had uttered to thee when alive. Thou wert my ruin, 
<A NAME="1005"></A>making me and my brother orphans, though we had never injured thee, and 
<A NAME="1006"></A>thou didst make a shameful marriage with my mother, having slain her lord 
<A NAME="1007"></A>who led the host of Hellas, though thyself didst never go to Troy. Such 
<A NAME="1008"></A>was thy folly, thou didst never dream that my mother would prove thy curse 
<A NAME="1009"></A>when thou didst marry her, though thou wert wronging my father's honour. 
<A NAME="1010"></A>Know this; whoso defiles his neighbour's wife, and afterward is forced 
<A NAME="1011"></A>to take her to himself, is a wretched wight, if he supposes she will be 
<A NAME="1012"></A>chaste as his wife, though she sinned against her former lord. Thine was 
<A NAME="1013"></A>a life most miserable, though thou didst pretend 'twas otherwise; well 
<A NAME="1014"></A>thou knewest how guilty thy marriage was, and my mother knew she had a 
<A NAME="1015"></A>villain for husband. Sinners both ye took each other's lot, she thy fortune, 
<A NAME="1016"></A>thou her curse. While everywhere in Argos thou-wouldst hear such phrases 
<A NAME="1017"></A>as, "that woman's husband," never "that man's wife." Yet 'tis shameful 
<A NAME="1018"></A>for the wife and not the man to rule the house; wherefore I loathe those 
<A NAME="1019"></A>children, who are called in the city not the sons of the man, their father, 
<A NAME="1020"></A>but of their mother. For if a man makes a great match above his rank, there 
<A NAME="1021"></A>is no talk of the husband but only of the wife. Herein lay thy grievous 
<A NAME="1022"></A>error, due to ignorance; thou thoughtest thyself some one, relying on thy 
<A NAME="1023"></A>wealth, but this is naught save to stay with us a space. 'Tis nature that 
<A NAME="1024"></A>stands fast, not wealth. For it, if it abide unchanged, exalts man's horn; 
<A NAME="1025"></A>but riches dishonestly acquired and in the hands of fools, soon take their 
<A NAME="1026"></A>flight, their blossom quickly shed. As for thy sins with women, I pass 
<A NAME="1027"></A>them by, 'tis not for maiden's lips to mention them, but I will shrewdly 
<A NAME="1028"></A>hint thereat. And then thy arrogance! because forsooth thou hadst a palace 
<A NAME="1029"></A>and some looks to boast. May I never have a husband with a girl's face, 
<A NAME="1030"></A>but one that bears him like a man! For the children of these latter cling

<A NAME="1127"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>True; but thy father plotted so wickedly against those of his 
<A NAME="1128"></A>own kin whom least of all he should have treated so. Speak I must; albeit, 
<A NAME="1129"></A>when woman gets an evil reputation, there is a feeling of bitterness against 
<A NAME="1130"></A>all she says; unfairly indeed in my case, for it were only fair to hate 
<A NAME="1131"></A>after learning the circumstances, and seeing if the object deserves it; 
<A NAME="1132"></A>otherwise, why hate at all? Now Tyndareus bestowed me on thy father not 
<A NAME="1133"></A>that I or any children I might bear should be slain. Yet he went and took 
<A NAME="1134"></A>my daughter from our house to the fleet at Aulis, persuading me that Achilles 
<A NAME="1135"></A>was to wed her; and there he held her o'er the pyre, and cut Iphigenia's 
<A NAME="1136"></A>snowy throat. Had he slain her to save his city from capture, or to benefit 
<A NAME="1137"></A>his house, or to preserve his other children, a sacrifice of one for many, 
<A NAME="1138"></A>could have pardoned him. But, as it was, his reasons for murdering my child 
<A NAME="1139"></A>were these: the wantonness of Helen and her husband's folly in not punishing 
<A NAME="1140"></A>the traitress. Still, wronged as I was, my rage had not burst forth for 
<A NAME="1141"></A>this, nor would I have slain my lord, had he not returned to me with that 
<A NAME="1142"></A>frenzied maiden and made her his mistress, keeping at once two brides beneath 
<A NAME="1143"></A>the same roof. Women maybe are given to folly, I do not deny it; this granted, 
<A NAME="1144"></A>when a husband goes astray and sets aside his own true wife, she fain will 
<A NAME="1145"></A>follow his example and find another love; and then in our case hot abuse 
<A NAME="1146"></A>is heard, while the men, who are to blame for this, escape without a word. 
<A NAME="1147"></A>Again, suppose Menelaus had been secretly snatched from his home, should 
<A NAME="1148"></A>I have had to kill Orestes to save Menelaus, my sister's husband? How would 
<A NAME="1149"></A>thy father have endured this? Was he then to escape death for slaying what 
<A NAME="1150"></A>was mine, while I was to suffer at his hands? I slew him, turning, as my 
<A NAME="1151"></A>only course, to his enemies. For which of all thy father's friends would 
<A NAME="1152"></A>have joined me in his murder? Speak all that is in thy heart, and prove 
<A NAME="1153"></A>against me with all free speech, that thy father's death was not deserved.

<A NAME="1166"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Then will I speak, and this shall be the prelude of my speech: 
<A NAME="1167"></A>Ah, mother mine! would thou hadst had a better heart; for though thy beauty 
<A NAME="1168"></A>and Helen's win you praises well deserved, yet are ye akin in nature, pair 
<A NAME="1169"></A>of wantons, unworthy of Castor. She was carried off, 'tis true, but her 
<A NAME="1170"></A>fall was voluntary: and thou hast slain the bravest soul in Hellas, excusing 
<A NAME="1171"></A>thyself on the ground that thou didst kill a husband to avenge a daughter; 
<A NAME="1172"></A>the world does not know thee so well as I do, thou who before ever thy 
<A NAME="1173"></A>daughter's death was decided, yea, soon as thy lord had started from his 
<A NAME="1174"></A>home, wert combing thy golden tresses at thy mirror. That wife who, when 
<A NAME="1175"></A>her lord is gone from home, sets to beautifying herself, strike off from 
<A NAME="1176"></A>virtue's list; for she has no need to carry her beauty abroad, save she 
<A NAME="1177"></A>is seeking some mischief. Of all the wives in Hellas thou wert the only 
<A NAME="1178"></A>one I know who wert overjoyed when Troy's star was in the ascendant, while, 
<A NAME="1179"></A>if it set, thy brow was clouded, since thou hadst no wish that Agamemnon 
<A NAME="1180"></A>should return from Troy. And yet thou couldst have played a virtuous part 
<A NAME="1181"></A>to thy own glory. The husband thou hadst was no whit inferior to Aegisthus, 
<A NAME="1182"></A>for he it was whom Hellas chose to be her captain. And when thy sister 
<A NAME="1183"></A>Helen wrought that deed of shame, thou couldst have won thyself great glory, 
<A NAME="1184"></A>for vice is a warning and calls attention to virtue. If, as thou allegest, 
<A NAME="1185"></A>my father slew thy daughter, what is the wrong I and my brother have done 
<A NAME="1186"></A>thee? How was it thou didst not bestow on us our father's halls after thy 
<A NAME="1187"></A>husband's death, instead of bartering them to buy a paramour? Again, thy 
<A NAME="1188"></A>husband is not exiled for thy son's sake, nor is he slain to avenge my 
<A NAME="1189"></A>death, although by him this life is quenched twice as much as e'er my sister's 
<A NAME="1190"></A>was; so if murder is to succeed murder in requital, I and thy son Orestes 
<A NAME="1191"></A>must slay thee to avenge our father; if that was just, why so is this. 
<A NAME="1192"></A>Whoso fixes his gaze on wealth or noble birth and weds a wicked woman, 
<A NAME="1193"></A>is a fool; better is a humble partner in his home, if she be virtuous, 
<A NAME="1194"></A>than a proud one. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
