<BR><BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="22"></A><B>IOLAUS</B>
<A NAME="23"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>I hold this true, and long have held: Nature hath made one 
<A NAME="24"></A>man upright for his neighbours' good, while another hath a disposition 
<A NAME="25"></A>wholly given over to gain, useless alike to the state and difficult to 
<A NAME="26"></A>have dealings with, but for himself the best of men; and this I know, not 
<A NAME="27"></A>from mere hearsay. For I, from pure regard and reverence for my kith and 
<A NAME="28"></A>kin, though might have lived at peace in Argos, alone of all my race shared 
<A NAME="29"></A>with Heracles his labours, while he was yet with us, and now that he dwells 
<A NAME="30"></A>in heaven, I keep these his children safe beneath my wing, though myself 
<A NAME="31"></A>need protection. For when their father passed from earth away, Eurystheus 
<A NAME="32"></A>would first of all have slain us, but we escaped. And though our home is 
<A NAME="33"></A>lost, our life was saved. But in exile we wander from city to city, ever 
<A NAME="34"></A>forced to roam. For, added to our former wrongs, Eurystheus thought it 
<A NAME="35"></A>fit to put this further outrage upon us: wheresoe'er he heard that we were 
<A NAME="36"></A>settling, thither would he send heralds demanding our surrender and driving 
<A NAME="37"></A>us from thence, holding out this threat, that Argos is no meal city to 
<A NAME="38"></A>make a friend or foe, and furthermore pointing to his own prosperity. So 
<A NAME="39"></A>they, seeing how weak my means, and these little ones left without a father, 
<A NAME="40"></A>bow to his superior might and drive us from their land. And I share the 
<A NAME="41"></A>exile of these children, and help them bear their evil lot by my sympathy, 
<A NAME="42"></A>loth to betray them, lest someone say, "Look you! now that the children's 
<A NAME="43"></A>sire is dead, Iolaus no more protects them, kinsman though he is." Not 
<A NAME="44"></A>one corner left us in the whole of Hellas, we are come to Marathon and 
<A NAME="45"></A>its neighbouring land, and here we sit as suppliants at the altars of the 
<A NAME="46"></A>gods, and pray their aid; for 'tis said two sons of Theseus dwell upon 
<A NAME="47"></A>these plains, the lot of their inheritance, scions of Pandion's stock, 
<A NAME="48"></A>related to these children; this the reason we have come on this our way 
<A NAME="49"></A>to the borders of glorious Athens. To lead the flight two aged guides are 
<A NAME="50"></A>we; my care is centred on these boys, while she, I mean Alcmena, clasps 
<A NAME="51"></A>her son's daughter in her arms, and bears her for safety within this shrine, 
<A NAME="52"></A>for we shrink from letting tender maidens come anigh the crowd or stand 
<A NAME="53"></A>as suppliants at the altar. Now Hvllus and the elder of his brethren are 
<A NAME="54"></A>seeking some place for us to find a refuge, if we are driven by force from 
<A NAME="55"></A>this land. O children, children, come hither! hold unto my robe; for lo! 
<A NAME="56"></A>I see a herald coming towards us from Eurystheus, by whom we are persecuted, 
<A NAME="57"></A>wanderers excluded from every land. A curse on the and him that sent thee, 
<A NAME="58"></A>hateful wretch! for that same tongue of thine hath oft announced its master's 
<A NAME="59"></A>evil hests to these children's noble sire as well. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="62"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Doubtless thy folly lets thee think this is a good position 
<A NAME="63"></A>to have taken up, and that thou art come to a city that will help thee. 
<A NAME="64"></A>No! there is none that will prefer thy feeble arm to the might of Eurystheus. 
<A NAME="65"></A>Begone! why take this trouble? Thou must arise and go to Argos, where awaits 
<A NAME="66"></A>thee death by stoning. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="67"></A><B>IOLAUS</B>
<A NAME="68"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Not so, for the god's altar will protect me, and this land

<A NAME="70"></A><B>COPREUS</B>
<A NAME="71"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Wilt give me the trouble of laying hands on thee?

<A NAME="73"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>By force at least shalt thou never drag these children hence. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="74"></A><B>COPREUS</B>
<A NAME="75"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>That shalt thou soon learn; it seems thou wert a poor prophet,

<A NAME="87"></A>sacred wreaths defiled, shame to your city, to the gods dishonour.

<A NAME="102"></A>From what land, old stranger, art thou come to this confederate state of

<A NAME="104"></A>the sea, put in here from across the firth? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<A NAME="123"></A>What is their quest? Are they anxious, tell me, to obtain an audience of

<A NAME="125"></A><B>IOLAUS</B>
<A NAME="126"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>That so they may escape surrender, nor be torn with violence

<A NAME="128"></A><B>COPREUS</B>
<A NAME="129"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Nay, this will nowise satisfy thy masters, who o'er thee have

<A NAME="132"></A><I>chanting</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="133"></A>Stranger, 'tis but right we should reverence the gods' suppliants, suffering

<A NAME="135"></A>justice ne'er permit. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="136"></A><B>COPREUS</B>
<A NAME="137"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Do thou then drive these subjects of Eurystheus forth, and

<A NAME="164"></A><B>LEADER</B>
<A NAME="165"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>There sit the sons of Heracles as suppliants, having wreathed

<A NAME="168"></A><B>DEMOPHON</B>

<A NAME="171"></A><I>turning to COPREUS</I><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="172"></A>This fellow caused the uproar by trying to drag them forcibly from this 
<A NAME="173"></A>altar, and he hurled down the old man, till my tears for pity flowed.

<A NAME="174"></A><B>DEMOPHON</B>
<A NAME="175"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Hellenic dress and fashion in his robes doth he no doubt adopt, 
<A NAME="176"></A>but deeds like these betray the barbarian. Thou, sirrah, tell me straight 
<A NAME="177"></A>the country whence thou camest thither. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="178"></A><B>COPREUS</B>
<A NAME="179"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>An Argive I; since that thou seek'st to know. Who sent me, 
<A NAME="180"></A>and the object of my coming, will I freely tell. Eurystheus, king of Mycenae, 
<A NAME="181"></A>sends me hither to fetch these back; and I have come, sir stranger, with 
<A NAME="182"></A>just grounds in plenty, alike for speech or action. An Argive myself, Argives 
<A NAME="183"></A>I come to fetch, taking with me these runaways from my native city, on 
<A NAME="184"></A>whom the doom of death was passed by our laws there; and we have right, 
<A NAME="185"></A>since we rule our city independently, to ratify its sentences. And though 
<A NAME="186"></A>they have come as suppliants to the altars of numerous others, we have 
<A NAME="187"></A>taken our stand on these same arguments, and no one has ventured to bring 
<A NAME="188"></A>upon himself evils of his own getting. But they have come hither, either 
<A NAME="189"></A>because they perceived some folly in thee, or, in their perplexity, staking 
<A NAME="190"></A>all on one risky throw to win or lose; for surely they do not suppose that 
<A NAME="191"></A>thou, if so thou hast thy senses still, and only thou, in all the breadth 
<A NAME="192"></A>of Hellas they have traversed, wilt pity their foolish troubles. Come now, 
<A NAME="193"></A>put argument against argument: what will be thy gain, suppose thou admit 
<A NAME="194"></A>them to thy land, or let us take them hence? From us these benefits are 
<A NAME="195"></A>thine to win: this city can secure as friends Argos, with its far-reaching 
<A NAME="196"></A>arm, and Eurystheus' might complete; whilst if thou lend an ear to their 
<A NAME="197"></A>piteous pleading and grow soft, the matter must result in trial of arms; 
<A NAME="198"></A>for be sure we shall not yield this struggle without appealing to the sword. 
<A NAME="199"></A>What pretext wilt thou urge? Of what domains art thou robbed that thou 
<A NAME="200"></A>shouldst take and wage war with the Tirynthian Argives? What kind of allies 
<A NAME="201"></A>art thou aiding? For whom will they have fallen whom thou buriest? Surely 
<A NAME="202"></A>thou wilt get an evil name from the citizens, if for the sake of an old 
<A NAME="203"></A>man near the grave, a mere shadow I may say, and for these children, thou 
<A NAME="204"></A>wilt plunge into troublous waters. The best thou canst say is, that thou 
<A NAME="205"></A>wilt find in them a hope, and nothing more; and yet this falls far short 
<A NAME="206"></A>of the present need; for these would be but a poor match for Argives even 
<A NAME="207"></A>when fully armed and in their prime, if haply that raises thy spirits; 
<A NAME="208"></A>moreover, the time 'twixt now and then is long, wherein ye may be blotted 
<A NAME="209"></A>out. Nay, hearken to me; give me naught, but let me take mine own, and 
<A NAME="210"></A>so gain Mycenae; but forbear to act now, as is your Athenian way, and take 
<A NAME="211"></A>the weaker side, when it is in thy power to choose the stronger as thy 
<A NAME="212"></A>friends. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="213"></A><B>LEADER</B>
<A NAME="214"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>Who can decide a cause or ascertain its merits, till from both 
<A NAME="215"></A>sides he clearly learn what they would say? </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<A NAME="216"></A><B>IOLAUS</B>
<A NAME="217"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>O king, in thy land I start with this advantage, the right 
<A NAME="218"></A>to hear and speak in turn, and none, ere that, will drive me hence as elsewhere 
<A NAME="219"></A>they would. 'Twixt us and him is naught in common, for we no longer have 
<A NAME="220"></A>aught to do with Argos since that decree was passed, but we are exiles 
<A NAME="221"></A>from our native land; how then can he justly drag us back as subjects of 
<A NAME="222"></A>Mycenae, seeing that they have banished us? For we are strangers. Or do 
<A NAME="223"></A>ye claim that every exile from Argos is exiled from the bounds of Hellas? 
<A NAME="224"></A>Not from Athens surely; for ne'er will she for fear of Argos drive the 
<A NAME="225"></A>children of Heracles from her land. Here is no Trachis, not at all; no! 
<A NAME="226"></A>nor that Achaean town, whence thou, defying justice, but boasting of the 
<A NAME="227"></A>might of Argos in the very words thou now art using, didst drive the suppliants 
<A NAME="228"></A>from their station at the altar. If this shall be, and they thy words approve, 
<A NAME="229"></A>why then I trow this is no more Athens, the home of freedom. Nay, but I 
<A NAME="230"></A>know the temper and nature of these citizens; they would rather die, for 
<A NAME="231"></A>honour ranks before mere life with men of worth. Enough of Athens! for 
<A NAME="232"></A>excessive praise is apt to breed disgust; and oft ere now have myself felt 
<A NAME="233"></A>vexed at praise that knows no bounds. But to thee, as ruler of this land, 
<A NAME="234"></A>fain would show the reason why thou art bound to save these children. Pittheus 
<A NAME="235"></A>was the son of Pelops; from him sprung Aethra, and from her Theseus thy 
<A NAME="236"></A>sire was born. And now will I trace back these children's lineage for thee. 
<A NAME="237"></A>Heracles was son of Zeus and Alcmena; Alcmena sprang from Pelops' daughter; 
<A NAME="238"></A>therefore thy father and their father would be the sons of first cousins. 
<A NAME="239"></A>Thus then art thou to them related, O Demophon, but thy just debt to them 
<A NAME="240"></A>beyond the ties of kinship do I now declare to thee; for I assert, in days 
<A NAME="241"></A>gone by, I was with Theseus on the ship, as their father's squire, when 
<A NAME="242"></A>they went to fetch that girdle fraught with death; yea, and from Hades' 
<A NAME="243"></A>murky dungeons did Heracles bring thy father up; as all Hellas doth attest. 
<A NAME="244"></A>Wherefore in return they crave this boon of thee, that they be not surrendered

<A NAME="837"></A><B>SERVANT</B>
<A NAME="838"></A><BLOCKQUOTE>One speech of mine puts it all clearly before thee. When we 
<A NAME="839"></A>had deployed our troops and marshalled them face to face with one another, 
<A NAME="840"></A>Hyllus dismounted from his four-horsed chariot and stood midway betwixt 
<A NAME="841"></A>the hosts. Then cried he, "Captain, who art come from Argos, why cannot 
<A NAME="842"></A>we leave this land alone? No hurt wilt thou do Mycenae, if of one man thou 
<A NAME="843"></A>rob her; come! meet me in single combat. and if thou slay me, take the 
<A NAME="844"></A>children of Heracles away with thee, but, if thou fall, leave me to possess 
<A NAME="845"></A>my ancestral honours and my home." The host cried yes! saying the scheme 
<A NAME="846"></A>he offered was a fair one, both to rid them of their trouble and satisfy 
<A NAME="847"></A>their valour. But that other, feeling no shame before those who heard the 
<A NAME="848"></A>challenge or at his own cowardice, quailed, general though he was, to come 
<A NAME="849"></A>within reach of the stubborn spear, showing himself an abject coward; yet 
<A NAME="850"></A>with such a spirit he came to enslave the children of Heracles. Then did 
<A NAME="851"></A>Hyllus withdraw to his own ranks again, and the prophets seeing that no 
<A NAME="852"></A>reconciliation would be effected by single combat, began the sacrifice 
<A NAME="853"></A>without delay and forthwith let flow from a human throat auspicious streams 
<A NAME="854"></A>of blood. And some were mounting chariots, while others couched beneath 
<A NAME="855"></A>the shelter of their shields, and the king of the Athenians, as a highborn 
<A NAME="856"></A>chieftain should, would exhort his host-"Fellow-citizens, the land, that 
<A NAME="857"></A>feeds you and that gave you birth, demands to-day the help of every man." 
<A NAME="858"></A>Likewise Eurystheus besought his allies that they should scorn to sully 
<A NAME="859"></A>the fame of Argos and Mycenae. Anon the Etrurian trumpet sounded loud and 
<A NAME="860"></A>clear, and hand to hand they rushed; then think how loudly clashed their 
<A NAME="861"></A>ringing shields, what din arose of cries and groans confused! At first 
<A NAME="862"></A>the onset of the Argive spearmen broke our ranks; then they in turn gave 
<A NAME="863"></A>ground; next, foot to foot and man to man, they fought their stubborn fray, 
<A NAME="864"></A>many falling the while. And either chief cheered on his men, "Sons of Athens! 
<A NAME="865"></A>Ye who till the fields of Argos! ward from your land disgrace." Do all 
<A NAME="866"></A>we could, and spite of every effort, scarce could we turn the Argive line 
<A NAME="867"></A>in flight. When lo! old Iolaus sees Hyllus starting from the ranks, whereon 
<A NAME="868"></A>he lifts his hands to him with a prayer to take him up into his chariot. 
<A NAME="869"></A>Thereon he seized the reins and went hard after the horses of Eurystheus. 
<A NAME="870"></A>From this point onward must I speak from hearsay, though hitherto as one 
<A NAME="871"></A>whose own eyes saw. For as he was crossing Pallene's hill, sacred to the 
<A NAME="872"></A>goddess Athene, he caught sight of Eurystheus' chariot, and prayed to Hebe 
<A NAME="873"></A>and to Zeus, that for one single day he might grow young again and wreak 
<A NAME="874"></A>his vengeance on his foes. Now must thou hear a wondrous tale: two stars 
<A NAME="875"></A>settled on the horses' yokes and threw the chariot into dark shadow, which-at 
<A NAME="876"></A>least so say our wiser folk-were thy son and Hebe; and from that murky 
<A NAME="877"></A>gloom appeared that aged man in the form of a youth with strong young arms; 
<A NAME="878"></A>then by the rocks of Sciron the hero Iolaus o'ertakes Eurystheus' chariot. 
<A NAME="879"></A>And he bound his hands with gyves, and is bringing that chieftain once 
<A NAME="880"></A>so prosperous as a trophy hither, whose fortune now doth preach a lesson, 
<A NAME="881"></A>clear as day, to all the sons of men, that none should envy him, who seems 
<A NAME="882"></A>to thrive, until they see his death; for fortune's moods last but a day.

<A NAME="995"></A>thy cousin, and kinsman to Heracles, thy son; but whether I would or no, 
<A NAME="996"></A>Hera, by her power divine, caused me to be afflicted thus. Still, when 
<A NAME="997"></A>undertook to be his foe, and when I knew I had to enter on this struggle, 
<A NAME="998"></A>I set myself to devise trouble in plenty, and oft from time to time my 
<A NAME="999"></A>midnight communing bore fruit, scheming how to push aside and slay my foes, 
<A NAME="1000"></A>and for the future divorce myself from fear; for I knew that son of thine 
<A NAME="1001"></A>was no mere cipher, but a man indeed; yea, for, though he was my foe, I 
<A NAME="1002"></A>will speak well of him, because he was a man of worth. Now, after he was 
<A NAME="1003"></A>taken hence, was I not forced, by reason of these children's hatred, and 
<A NAME="1004"></A>because I was conscious of an hereditary feud, to leave no stone unturned 
<A NAME="1005"></A>by slaying, banishing, and plotting against them? So long as I did so, 
<A NAME="1006"></A>my safety was assured. Suppose thyself hadst had my lot, wouldst not thou

<A NAME="1009"></A>since they did not slay me then, when I was prepared to die, by the laws 
<A NAME="1010"></A>of Hellas my death becomes a curse on him who slays me now. The city wisely
