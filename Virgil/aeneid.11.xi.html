<A NAME="10"></A>Scarce had the rosy Morning rais'd her head
<A NAME="11"></A><BR>Above the waves, and left her wat'ry bed;
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>The pious chief, whom double cares attend
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>For his unburied soldiers and his friend,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>Yet first to Heav'n perform'd a victor's vows:
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>He bar'd an ancient oak of all her boughs;
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Then on a rising ground the trunk he plac'd,
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Which with the spoils of his dead foe he grac'd.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>The coat of arms by proud Mezentius worn,
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Now on a naked snag in triumph borne,
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Was hung on high, and glitter'd from afar,
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>A trophy sacred to the God of War.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Above his arms, fix'd on the leafless wood,
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Appear'd his plumy crest, besmear'd with blood:
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>His brazen buckler on the left was seen;
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Truncheons of shiver'd lances hung between;
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>And on the right was placed his corslet, bor'd;
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>And to the neck was tied his unavailing sword.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>A crowd of chiefs inclose the godlike man,
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Who thus, conspicuous in the midst, began:
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>"Our toils, my friends, are crown'd with sure success;
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>The greater part perform'd, achieve the less.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Now follow cheerful to the trembling town;
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Press but an entrance, and presume it won.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Fear is no more, for fierce Mezentius lies,
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>As the first fruits of war, a sacrifice.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>Turnus shall fall extended on the plain,
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>And, in this omen, is already slain.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Prepar'd in arms, pursue your happy chance;
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>That none unwarn'd may plead his ignorance,
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>And I, at Heav'n's appointed hour, may find
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Your warlike ensigns waving in the wind.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Meantime the rites and fun'ral pomps prepare,
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Due to your dead companions of the war:
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>The last respect the living can bestow,
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>To shield their shadows from contempt below.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>That conquer'd earth be theirs, for which they fought,
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>And which for us with their own blood they bought;
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>But first the corpse of our unhappy friend
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>To the sad city of Evander send,
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Who, not inglorious, in his age's bloom,
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Was hurried hence by too severe a doom."
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>Thus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way,
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Where, new in death, lamented Pallas lay.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Acoetes watch'd the corpse; whose youth deserv'd
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>The father's trust; and now the son he serv'd
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>With equal faith, but less auspicious care.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>Th' attendants of the slain his sorrow share.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>A troop of Trojans mix'd with these appear,
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>And mourning matrons with dishevel'd hair.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Soon as the prince appears, they raise a cry;
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>All beat their breasts, and echoes rend the sky.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>They rear his drooping forehead from the ground;
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>But, when Aeneas view'd the grisly wound
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Which Pallas in his manly bosom bore,
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>And the fair flesh distain'd with purple gore;
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>First, melting into tears, the pious man
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Deplor'd so sad a sight, then thus began:
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>"Unhappy youth! when Fortune gave the rest
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Of my full wishes, she refus'd the best!
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>She came; but brought not thee along, to bless
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>My longing eyes, and share in my success:
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>She grudg'd thy safe return, the triumphs due
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>To prosp'rous valor, in the public view.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Not thus I promis'd, when thy father lent
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Thy needless succor with a sad consent;
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Embrac'd me, parting for th' Etrurian land,
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>And sent me to possess a large command.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>He warn'd, and from his own experience told,
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Our foes were warlike, disciplin'd, and bold.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>And now perhaps, in hopes of thy return,
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Rich odors on his loaded altars burn,
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>While we, with vain officious pomp, prepare
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>To send him back his portion of the war,
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>A bloody breathless body, which can owe
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>No farther debt, but to the pow'rs below.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>The wretched father, ere his race is run,
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Shall view the fun'ral honors of his son.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>These are my triumphs of the Latian war,
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care!
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>And yet, unhappy sire, thou shalt not see
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>A son whose death disgrac'd his ancestry;
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Thou shalt not blush, old man, however griev'd:
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Thy Pallas no dishonest wound receiv'd.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>He died no death to make thee wish, too late,
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Thou hadst not liv'd to see his shameful fate:
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>But what a champion has th' Ausonian coast,
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>And what a friend hast thou, Ascanius, lost!"
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Thus having mourn'd, he gave the word around,
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>To raise the breathless body from the ground;
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>And chose a thousand horse, the flow'r of all
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>His warlike troops, to wait the funeral,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>To bear him back and share Evander's grief:
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>A well-becoming, but a weak relief.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier,
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Then on their shoulders the sad burden rear.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>The body on this rural hearse is borne:
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Strew'd leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>All pale he lies, and looks a lovely flow'r,
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>New cropp'd by virgin hands, to dress the bow'r:
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>Unfaded yet, but yet unfed below,
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>No more to mother earth or the green stern shall 
<A NAME="112"></A>owe.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Then two fair vests, of wondrous work and cost,
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Of purple woven, and with gold emboss'd,
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>For ornament the Trojan hero brought,
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Which with her hands Sidonian Dido wrought.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>One vest array'd the corpse; and one they spread
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>O'er his clos'd eyes, and wrapp'd around his head,
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>That, when the yellow hair in flame should fall,
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>The catching fire might burn the golden caul.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Besides, the spoils of foes in battle slain,
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>When he descended on the Latian plain;
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Arms, trappings, horses, by the hearse are led
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>In long array- th' achievements of the dead.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Then, pinion'd with their hands behind, appear
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Th' unhappy captives, marching in the rear,
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Appointed off'rings in the victor's name,
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>To sprinkle with their blood the fun'ral flame.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Inferior trophies by the chiefs are borne;
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Gauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn;
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>And fair inscriptions fix'd, and titles read
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Of Latian leaders conquer'd by the dead.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>Acoetes on his pupil's corpse attends,
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>With feeble steps, supported by his friends.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Pausing at ev'ry pace, in sorrow drown'd,
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Betwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground;
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Where grov'ling while he lies in deep despair,
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>He beats his breast, and rends his hoary hair.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>The champion's chariot next is seen to roll,
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>Besmear'd with hostile blood, and honorably foul.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>To close the pomp, Aethon, the steed of state,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Is led, the fun'rals of his lord to wait.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Stripp'd of his trappings, with a sullen pace
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>He walks; and the big tears run rolling down his 
<A NAME="145"></A>face.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>The lance of Pallas, and the crimson crest,
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Are borne behind: the victor seiz'd the rest.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>The march begins: the trumpets hoarsely sound;
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>The pikes and lances trail along the ground.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Thus while the Trojan and Arcadian horse
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>To Pallantean tow'rs direct their course,
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>In long procession rank'd, the pious chief
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Stopp'd in the rear, and gave a vent to grief:
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>"The public care," he said, "which war attends,
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Diverts our present woes, at least suspends.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Peace with the manes of great Pallas dwell!
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>Hail, holy relics! and a last farewell!"
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>He said no more, but, inly thro' he mourn'd,
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Restrained his tears, and to the camp return'd.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Now suppliants, from Laurentum sent, demand
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>A truce, with olive branches in their hand;
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Obtest his clemency, and from the plain
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>They plead, that none those common rites deny
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>To conquer'd foes that in fair battle die.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>All cause of hate was ended in their death;
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>Nor could he war with bodies void of breath.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>A king, they hop'd, would hear a king's request,
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Whose son he once was call'd, and once his guest.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Their suit, which was too just to be denied,
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>The hero grants, and farther thus replied:
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>"O Latian princes, how severe a fate
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>In causeless quarrels has involv'd your state,
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>And arm'd against an unoffending man,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Who sought your friendship ere the war began!
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>You beg a truce, which I would gladly give,
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Not only for the slain, but those who live.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>I came not hither but by Heav'n's command,
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>And sent by fate to share the Latian land.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Nor wage I wars unjust: your king denied
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>My proffer'd friendship, and my promis'd bride;
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Left me for Turnus. Turnus then should try
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>His cause in arms, to conquer or to die.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>My right and his are in dispute: the slain
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Fell without fault, our quarrel to maintain.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>In equal arms let us alone contend;
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>And let him vanquish, whom his fates befriend.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>This is the way (so tell him) to possess
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>The royal virgin, and restore the peace.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Bear this message back, with ample leave,
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>That your slain friends may fun'ral rites receive."
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Thus having said- th' embassadors, amaz'd,
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Stood mute a while, and on each other gaz'd.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Drances, their chief, who harbor'd in his breast
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Long hate to Turnus, as his foe profess'd,
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Broke silence first, and to the godlike man,
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>With graceful action bowing, thus began:
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>"Auspicious prince, in arms a mighty name,
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>But yet whose actions far transcend your fame;
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Would I your justice or your force express,
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Thought can but equal; and all words are less.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Your answer we shall thankfully relate,
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>And favors granted to the Latian state.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>If wish'd success our labor shall attend,
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Think peace concluded, and the king your friend:
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Let Turnus leave the realm to your command,
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>And seek alliance in some other land:
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Build you the city which your fates assign;
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>We shall be proud in the great work to join."
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Thus Drances; and his words so well persuade
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>The rest impower'd, that soon a truce is made.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>Twelve days the term allow'd: and, during those,
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Latians and Trojans, now no longer foes,
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Mix'd in the woods, for fun'ral piles prepare
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>To fell the timber, and forget the war.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Loud axes thro' the groaning groves resound;
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Oak, mountain ash, and poplar spread the ground;
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>First fall from high; and some the trunks receive
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>In loaden wains; with wedges some they cleave.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>And now the fatal news by Fame is blown
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Thro' the short circuit of th' Arcadian town,
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Of Pallas slain- by Fame, which just before
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>His triumphs on distended pinions bore.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>Rushing from out the gate, the people stand,
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>Each with a fun'ral flambeau in his hand.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Wildly they stare, distracted with amaze:
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>The fields are lighten'd with a fiery blaze,
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>That cast a sullen splendor on their friends,
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>The marching troop which their dead prince attends.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Both parties meet: they raise a doleful cry;
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply,
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>And their mix'd mourning rends the vaulted sky.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>The town is fill'd with tumult and with tears,
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>Till the loud clamors reach Evander's ears:
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Forgetful of his state, he runs along,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>With a disorder'd pace, and cleaves the throng;
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Falls on the corpse; and groaning there he lies,
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>With silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Short sighs and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>A passage, and at once he weeps and speaks:
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>"O Pallas! thou hast fail'd thy plighted word,
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>To fight with caution, not to tempt the sword!
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>I warn'd thee, but in vain; for well I knew
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>What perils youthful ardor would pursue,
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>That boiling blood would carry thee too far,
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Young as thou wert in dangers, raw to war!
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>O curst essay of arms, disastrous doom,
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Prelude of bloody fields, and fights to come!
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Hard elements of unauspicious war,
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Vain vows to Heav'n, and unavailing care!
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Thrice happy thou, dear partner of my bed,
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Whose holy soul the stroke of Fortune fled,
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Praescious of ills, and leaving me behind,
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>To drink the dregs of life by fate assign'd!
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Beyond the goal of nature I have gone:
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>My Pallas late set out, but reach'd too soon.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>If, for my league against th' Ausonian state,
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Amidst their weapons I had found my fate,
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>(Deserv'd from them,) then I had been return'd
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>A breathless victor, and my son had mourn'd.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Yet will I not my Trojan friend upbraid,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Nor grudge th' alliance I so gladly made.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>'T was not his fault, my Pallas fell so young,
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>But my own crime, for having liv'd too long.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Yet, since the gods had destin'd him to die,
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>At least he led the way to victory:
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>First for his friends he won the fatal shore,
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>And sent whole herds of slaughter'd foes before;
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>A death too great, too glorious to deplore.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Nor will I add new honors to thy grave,
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Content with those the Trojan hero gave:
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>That funeral pomp thy Phrygian friends design'd,
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>In which the Tuscan chiefs and army join'd.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Great spoils and trophies, gain'd by thee, they 
<A NAME="275"></A>bear:
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>Then let thy own achievements be thy share.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood,
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>Whose mighty trunk had better grac'd the wood,
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>If Pallas had arriv'd, with equal length
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>But why, unhappy man, dost thou detain
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>These troops, to view the tears thou shedd'st in 
<A NAME="283"></A>vain?
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Go, friends, this message to your lord relate:
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Tell him, that, if I bear my bitter fate,
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>And, after Pallas' death, live ling'ring on,
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>'T is to behold his vengeance for my son.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>I stay for Turnus, whose devoted head
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Is owing to the living and the dead.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>My son and I expect it from his hand;
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>'T is all that he can give, or we demand.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Joy is no more; but I would gladly go,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>To greet my Pallas with such news below."
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>The morn had now dispell'd the shades of night,
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Restoring toils, when she restor'd the light.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>The Trojan king and Tuscan chief command
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>To raise the piles along the winding strand.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Their friends convey the dead fun'ral fires;
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Black smold'ring smoke from the green wood expires;
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>The light of heav'n is chok'd, and the new day retires.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Then thrice around the kindled piles they go
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>(For ancient custom had ordain'd it so)
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led;
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>And thrice, with loud laments, they hail the dead.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Tears, trickling down their breasts, bedew the ground,
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Amid the blaze, their pious brethren throw
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>The spoils, in battle taken from the foe:
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Helms, bits emboss'd, and swords of shining steel;
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>One casts a target, one a chariot wheel;
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Some to their fellows their own arms restore:
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>The fauchions which in luckless fight they bore,
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>Their bucklers pierc'd, their darts bestow'd in 
<A NAME="314"></A>vain,
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>And shiver'd lances gather'd from the plain.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Whole herds of offer'd bulls, about the fire,
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>And bristled boars, and woolly sheep expire.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Around the piles a careful troop attends,
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>To watch the wasting flames, and weep their burning 
<A NAME="320"></A>friends;
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Ling'ring along the shore, till dewy night
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>New decks the face of heav'n with starry light.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>The conquer'd Latians, with like pious care,
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>Piles without number for their dead prepare.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Part in the places where they fell are laid;
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>And part are to the neighb'ring fields convey'd.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>The corps of kings, and captains of renown,
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Borne off in state, are buried in the town;
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>The rest, unhonor'd, and without a name,
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Are cast a common heap to feed the flame.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Trojans and Latians vie with like desires
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>To make the field of battle shine with fires,
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>And the promiscuous blaze to heav'n aspires.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Now had the morning thrice renew'd the light,
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>And thrice dispell'd the shadows of the night,
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>When those who round the wasted fires remain,
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Perform the last sad office to the slain.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>They rake the yet warm ashes from below;
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>These, and the bones unburn'd, in earth bestow;
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>These relics with their country rites they grace,
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>And raise a mount of turf to mark the place.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>But, in the palace of the king, appears
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>A scene more solemn, and a pomp of tears.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Maids, matrons, widows, mix their common moans;
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>Orphans their sires, and sires lament their sons.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>All in that universal sorrow share,
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>And curse the cause of this unhappy war:
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>A broken league, a bride unjustly sought,
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>A crown usurp'd, which with their blood is bought!
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>These are the crimes with which they load the name
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>Of Turnus, and on him alone exclaim:
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>"Let him who lords it o'er th' Ausonian land
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Engage the Trojan hero hand to hand:
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>His is the gain; our lot is but to serve;
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>'T is just, the sway he seeks, he should deserve."
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>This Drances aggravates; and adds, with spite:
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>"His foe expects, and dares him to the fight."
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Nor Turnus wants a party, to support
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>His cause and credit in the Latian court.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>His former acts secure his present fame,
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>And the queen shades him with her mighty name.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>While thus their factious minds with fury burn,
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>The legates from th' Aetolian prince return:
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Sad news they bring, that, after all the cost
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>And care employ'd, their embassy is lost;
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>That Diomedes refus'd his aid in war,
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>Unmov'd with presents, and as deaf to pray'r.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Some new alliance must elsewhere be sought,
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>Or peace with Troy on hard conditions bought.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Latinus, sunk in sorrow, finds too late,
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>A foreign son is pointed out by fate;
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>And, till Aeneas shall Lavinia wed,
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>The wrath of Heav'n is hov'ring o'er his head.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>The gods, he saw, espous'd the juster side,
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>When late their titles in the field were tried:
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Witness the fresh laments, and fun'ral tears undried.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Thus, full of anxious thought, he summons all
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>The Latian senate to the council hall.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>The princes come, commanded by their head,
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>And crowd the paths that to the palace lead.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Supreme in pow'r, and reverenc'd for his years,
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>He takes the throne, and in the midst appears.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Majestically sad, he sits in state,
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>And bids his envoys their success relate.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>When Venulus began, the murmuring sound
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Was hush'd, and sacred silence reign'd around.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>"We have," said he, "perform'd your high command,
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>And pass'd with peril a long tract of land:
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>We reach'd the place desir'd; with wonder fill'd,
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>The Grecian tents and rising tow'rs beheld.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>Great Diomede has compass'd round with walls
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>The city, which Argyripa he calls,
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>From his own Argos nam'd. We touch'd, with joy,
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>The royal hand that raz'd unhappy Troy.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>When introduc'd, our presents first we bring,
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>Then crave an instant audience from the king.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>His leave obtain'd, our native soil we name,
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>And tell th' important cause for which we came.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Attentively he heard us, while we spoke;
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Then, with soft accents, and a pleasing look,
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Made this return: 'Ausonian race, of old
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>Renown'd for peace, and for an age of gold,
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>What madness has your alter'd minds possess'd,
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>To change for war hereditary rest,
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>Solicit arms unknown, and tempt the sword,
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>A needless ill your ancestors abhorr'd?
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>We- for myself I speak, and all the name
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Of Grecians, who to Troy's destruction came,
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Omitting those who were in battle slain,
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Or borne by rolling Simois to the main-
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>Not one but suffer'd, and too dearly bought
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>The prize of honor which in arms he sought;
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Some doom'd to death, and some in exile driv'n.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Outcasts, abandon'd by the care of Heav'n;
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>So worn, so wretched, so despis'd a crew,
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>As ev'n old Priam might with pity view.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Witness the vessels by Minerva toss'd
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>In storms; the vengeful Capharean coast;
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Th' Euboean rocks! the prince, whose brother led
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Our armies to revenge his injur'd bed,
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>In Egypt lost! Ulysses with his men
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Have seen Charybdis and the Cyclops' den.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Why should I name Idomeneus, in vain
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Restor'd to scepters, and expell'd again?
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Or young Achilles, by his rival slain?
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Ev'n he, the King of Men, the foremost name
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Of all the Greeks, and most renown'd by fame,
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>The proud revenger of another's wife,
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Yet by his own adult'ress lost his life;
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Fell at his threshold; and the spoils of Troy
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>The foul polluters of his bed enjoy.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>The gods have envied me the sweets of life,
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>My much lov'd country, and my more lov'd wife:
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Banish'd from both, I mourn; while in the sky,
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Transform'd to birds, my lost companions fly:
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Hov'ring about the coasts, they make their moan,
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>And cuff the cliffs with pinions not their own.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>What squalid specters, in the dead of night,
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Break my short sleep, and skim before my sight!
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>I might have promis'd to myself those harms,
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Mad as I was, when I, with mortal arms,
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>Presum'd against immortal pow'rs to move,
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>And violate with wounds the Queen of Love.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Such arms this hand shall never more employ;
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>No hate remains with me to ruin'd Troy.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>I war not with its dust; nor am I glad
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>To think of past events, or good or bad.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Your presents I return: whate'er you bring
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>To buy my friendship, send the Trojan king.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>We met in fight; I know him, to my cost:
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>With what a whirling force his lance he toss'd!
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Heav'ns! what a spring was in his arm, to throw!
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>How high he held his shield, and rose at ev'ry blow!
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Had Troy produc'd two more his match in might,
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>They would have chang'd the fortune of the fight:
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Th' invasion of the Greeks had been return'd,
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Our empire wasted, and our cities burn'd.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>The long defense the Trojan people made,
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>The war protracted, and the siege delay'd,
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Were due to Hector's and this hero's hand:
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Both brave alike, and equal in command;
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Aeneas, not inferior in the field,
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>In pious reverence to the gods excell'd.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Make peace, ye Latians, and avoid with care
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Th' impending dangers of a fatal war.'
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>He said no more; but, with this cold excuse,
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Refus'd th' alliance, and advis'd a truce."
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Thus Venulus concluded his report.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>A jarring murmur fill'd the factious court:
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>As, when a torrent rolls with rapid force,
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>And dashes o'er the stones that stop the course,
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>The flood, constrain'd within a scanty space,
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Roars horrible along th' uneasy race;
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>White foam in gath'ring eddies floats around;
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>The rocky shores rebellow to the sound.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>The murmur ceas'd: then from his lofty throne
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>The king invok'd the gods, and thus begun:
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>"I wish, ye Latins, what we now debate
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Had been resolv'd before it was too late.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Much better had it been for you and me,
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Unforc'd by this our last necessity,
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>To have been earlier wise, than now to call
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>A council, when the foe surrounds the wall.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>O citizens, we wage unequal war,
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>With men not only Heav'n's peculiar care,
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>But Heav'n's own race; unconquer'd in the field,
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Or, conquer'd, yet unknowing how to yield.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>What hopes you had in Diomedes, lay down:
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Our hopes must center on ourselves alone.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Yet those how feeble, and, indeed, how vain,
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>You see too well; nor need my words explain.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>Vanquish'd without resource; laid flat by fate;
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Factions within, a foe without the gate!
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Not but I grant that all perform'd their parts
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>With manly force, and with undaunted hearts:
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>With our united strength the war we wag'd;
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>With equal numbers, equal arms, engag'd.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>You see th' event.- Now hear what I propose,
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>To save our friends, and satisfy our foes.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>A tract of land the Latins have possess'd
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Along the Tiber, stretching to the west,
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Which now Rutulians and Auruncans till,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>And their mix'd cattle graze the fruitful hill.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>Those mountains fill'd with firs, that lower land,
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>If you consent, the Trojan shall command,
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Call'd into part of what is ours; and there,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>On terms agreed, the common country share.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>There let'em build and settle, if they please;
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Unless they choose once more to cross the seas,
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>In search of seats remote from Italy,
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>And from unwelcome inmates set us free.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Then twice ten galleys let us build with speed,
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Or twice as many more, if more they need.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Materials are at hand; a well-grown wood
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Runs equal with the margin of the flood:
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Let them the number and the form assign;
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>The care and cost of all the stores be mine.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>To treat the peace, a hundred senators
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Shall be commission'd hence with ample pow'rs,
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>With olive the presents they shall bear,
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>A purple robe, a royal iv'ry chair,
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>And all the marks of sway that Latian monarchs wear,
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>And sums of gold. Among yourselves debate
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>This great affair, and save the sinking state."
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Then Drances took the word, who grudg'd, long since,
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>The rising glories of the Daunian prince.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Factious and rich, bold at the council board,
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>But cautious in the field, he shunn'd the sword;
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>A close caballer, and tongue-valiant lord.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Noble his mother was, and near the throne;
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>But, what his father's parentage, unknown.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>He rose, and took th' advantage of the times,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>To load young Turnus with invidious crimes.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>"Such truths, O king," said he, "your words contain,
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>As strike the sense, and all replies are vain;
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>Nor are your loyal subjects now to seek
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>What common needs require, but fear to speak.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Let him give leave of speech, that haughty man,
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Whose pride this unauspicious war began;
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>For whose ambition (let me dare to say,
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Fear set apart, tho' death is in my way)
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>The plains of Latium run with blood around.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>So many valiant heroes bite the ground;
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Dejected grief in ev'ry face appears;
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>A town in mourning, and a land in tears;
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>While he, th' undoubted author of our harms,
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>The man who menaces the gods with arms,
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Yet, after all his boasts, forsook the fight,
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>And sought his safety in ignoble flight.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>Now, best of kings, since you propose to send
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Such bounteous presents to your Trojan friend;
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Add yet a greater at our joint request,
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>One which he values more than all the rest:
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Give him the fair Lavinia for his bride;
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>With that alliance let the league be tied,
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>And for the bleeding land a lasting peace provide.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Let insolence no longer awe the throne;
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>But, with a father's right, bestow your own.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>For this maligner of the general good,
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>If still we fear his force, he must be woo'd;
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>His haughty godhead we with pray'rs implore,
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Your scepter to release, and our just rights restore.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>O cursed cause of all our ills, must we
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Wage wars unjust, and fall in fight, for thee!
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>What right hast thou to rule the Latian state,
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>And send us out to meet our certain fate?
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>'T is a destructive war: from Turnus' hand
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>Our peace and public safety we demand.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Let the fair bride to the brave chief remain;
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>If not, the peace, without the pledge, is vain.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Turnus, I know you think me not your friend,
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>Nor will I much with your belief contend:
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>I beg your greatness not to give the law
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>In others' realms, but, beaten, to withdraw.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Pity your own, or pity our estate;
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Nor twist our fortunes with your sinking fate.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Your interest is, the war should never cease;
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>But we have felt enough to wish the peace:
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>A land exhausted to the last remains,
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Depopulated towns, and driven plains.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Yet, if desire of fame, and thirst of pow'r,
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>A beauteous princess, with a crown in dow'r,
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>So fire your mind, in arms assert your right,
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>And meet your foe, who dares you to the fight.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Mankind, it seems, is made for you alone;
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>We, but the slaves who mount you to the throne:
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>A base ignoble crowd, without a name,
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Unwept, unworthy, of the fun'ral flame,
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>By duty bound to forfeit each his life,
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>That Turnus may possess a royal wife.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>Permit not, mighty man, so mean a crew
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Should share such triumphs, and detain from you
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>The post of honor, your undoubted due.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Rather alone your matchless force employ,
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>To merit what alone you must enjoy."
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>These words, so full of malice mix'd with art,
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Inflam'd with rage the youthful hero's heart.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Then, groaning from the bottom of his breast,
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>He heav'd for wind, and thus his wrath express'd:
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>"You, Drances, never want a stream of words,
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>Then, when the public need requires our swords.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>First in the council hall to steer the state,
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>And ever foremost in a tongue-debate,
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>While our strong walls secure us from the foe,
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Ere yet with blood our ditches overflow:
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>But let the potent orator declaim,
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>And with the brand of coward blot my name;
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>Free leave is giv'n him, when his fatal hand
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Has cover'd with more corps the sanguine strand,
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>And high as mine his tow'ring trophies stand.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>If any doubt remains, who dares the most,
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Let us decide it at the Trojan's cost,
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>And issue both abreast, where honor calls-
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>Foes are not far to seek without the walls-
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>Unless his noisy tongue can only fight,
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>And feet were giv'n him but to speed his flight.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>I beaten from the field? I forc'd away?
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Who, but so known a dastard, dares to say?
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>Had he but ev'n beheld the fight, his eyes
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Had witness'd for me what his tongue denies:
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>What heaps of Trojans by this hand were slain,
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>And how the bloody Tiber swell'd the main.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>All saw, but he, th' Arcadian troops retire
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>In scatter'd squadrons, and their prince expire.
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>The giant brothers, in their camp, have found,
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>I was not forc'd with ease to quit my ground.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Not such the Trojans tried me, when, inclos'd,
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>I singly their united arms oppos'd:
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>First forc'd an entrance thro' their thick array;
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>Then, glutted with their slaughter, freed my way.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>'T is a destructive war? So let it be,
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>But to the Phrygian pirate, and to thee!
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Meantime proceed to fill the people's ears
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>With false reports, their minds with panic fears:
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>Extol the strength of a twice-conquer'd race;
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Our foes encourage, and our friends debase.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Believe thy fables, and the Trojan town
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Triumphant stands; the Grecians are o'erthrown;
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Suppliant at Hector's feet Achilles lies,
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>And Diomede from fierce Aeneas flies.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Say rapid Aufidus with awful dread
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>Runs backward from the sea, and hides his head,
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>When the great Trojan on his bank appears;
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>For that's as true as thy dissembled fears
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>Of my revenge. Dismiss that vanity:
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Thou, Drances, art below a death from me.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Let that vile soul in that vile body rest;
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>The lodging is well worthy of the guest.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>"Now, royal father, to the present state
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Of our affairs, and of this high debate:
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>If in your arms thus early you diffide,
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>And think your fortune is already tried;
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>If one defeat has brought us down so low,
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>As never more in fields to meet the foe;
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>Then I conclude for peace: 't is time to treat,
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>And lie like vassals at the victor's feet.
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>But, O! if any ancient blood remains,
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>One drop of all our fathers', in our veins,
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>That man would I prefer before the rest,
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>Who dar'd his death with an undaunted breast;
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>Who comely fell, by no dishonest wound,
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>To shun that sight, and, dying, gnaw'd the ground.
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>But, if we still have fresh recruits in store,
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>If our confederates can afford us more;
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>If the contended field we bravely fought,
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>And not a bloodless victory was bought;
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Their losses equal'd ours; and, for their slain,
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>With equal fires they fill'd the shining plain;
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>Why thus, unforc'd, should we so tamely yield,
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>And, ere the trumpet sounds, resign the field?
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Good unexpected, evils unforeseen,
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Appear by turns, as fortune shifts the scene:
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Some, rais'd aloft, come tumbling down amain;
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>Then fall so hard, they bound and rise again.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>If Diomede refuse his aid to lend,
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>The great Messapus yet remains our friend:
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>Tolumnius, who foretells events, is ours;
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Th' Italian chiefs and princes join their pow'rs:
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Nor least in number, nor in name the last,
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Your own brave subjects have your cause embrac'd
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Above the rest, the Volscian Amazon
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Contains an army in herself alone,
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>And heads a squadron, terrible to sight,
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>With glitt'ring shields, in brazen armor bright.
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>Yet, if the foe a single fight demand,
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>And I alone the public peace withstand;
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>If you consent, he shall not be refus'd,
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>Nor find a hand to victory unus'd.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>This new Achilles, let him take the field,
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>With fated armor, and Vulcanian shield!
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>For you, my royal father, and my fame,
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>I, Turnus, not the least of all my name,
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>Devote my soul. He calls me hand to hand,
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>And I alone will answer his demand.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>Drances shall rest secure, and neither share
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>The danger, nor divide the prize of war."
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>While they debate, nor these nor those will yield,
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>Aeneas draws his forces to the field,
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>And moves his camp. The scouts with flying speed
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>Return, and thro' the frighted city spread
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>Th' unpleasing news, the Trojans are descried,
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>In battle marching by the river side,
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>And bending to the town. They take th' alarm:
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Some tremble, some are bold; all in confusion arm.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Th' impetuous youth press forward to the field;
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>They clash the sword, and clatter on the shield:
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>The fearful matrons raise a screaming cry;
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Old feeble men with fainter groans reply;
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>A jarring sound results, and mingles in the sky,
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>Like that of swans remurm'ring to the floods,
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>Or birds of diff'ring kinds in hollow woods.
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>Turnus th' occasion takes, and cries aloud:
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>"Talk on, ye quaint haranguers of the crowd:
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Declaim in praise of peace, when danger calls,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>And the fierce foes in arms approach the walls."
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>He said, and, turning short, with speedy pace,
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>Casts back a scornful glance, and quits the place:
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>"Thou, Volusus, the Volscian troops command
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>To mount; and lead thyself our Ardean band.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>Messapus and Catillus, post your force
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>Along the fields, to charge the Trojan horse.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Some guard the passes, others man the wall;
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Drawn up in arms, the rest attend my call."
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>They swarm from ev'ry quarter of the town,
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>And with disorder'd haste the rampires crown.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Good old Latinus, when he saw, too late,
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>The gath'ring storm just breaking on the state,
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>Dismiss'd the council till a fitter time,
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>And own'd his easy temper as his crime,
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Who, forc'd against his reason, had complied
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>To break the treaty for the promis'd bride.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Some help to sink new trenches; others aid
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>To ram the stones, or raise the palisade.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>Hoarse trumpets sound th' alarm; around the walls
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Runs a distracted crew, whom their last labor calls.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>A sad procession in the streets is seen,
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>Of matrons, that attend the mother queen:
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>High in her chair she sits, and, at her side,
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>With downcast eyes, appears the fatal bride.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>They mount the cliff, where Pallas' temple stands;
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>Pray'rs in their mouths, and presents in their hands,
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>With censers first they fume the sacred shrine,
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>Then in this common supplication join:
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>"O patroness of arms, unspotted maid,
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Propitious hear, and lend thy Latins aid!
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>Break short the pirate's lance; pronounce his fate,
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>And lay the Phrygian low before the gate."
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Now Turnus arms for fight. His back and breast
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Well-temper'd steel and scaly brass invest:
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>The cuishes which his brawny thighs infold
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>Are mingled metal damask'd o'er with gold.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>His faithful fauchion sits upon his side;
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Nor casque, nor crest, his manly features hide:
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>But, bare to view, amid surrounding friends,
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>With godlike grace, he from the tow'r descends.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>Exulting in his strength, he seems to dare
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>His absent rival, and to promise war.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>Freed from his keepers, thus, with broken reins,
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>The wanton courser prances o'er the plains,
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Or in the pride of youth o'erleaps the mounds,
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>And snuffs the females in forbidden grounds.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>Or seeks his wat'ring in the well-known flood,
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>To quench his thirst, and cool his fiery blood:
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>He swims luxuriant in the liquid plain,
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>And o'er his shoulder flows his waving mane:
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>He neighs, he snorts, he bears his head on high;
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>Before his ample chest the frothy waters fly.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>Soon as the prince appears without the gate,
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>The Volscians, with their virgin leader, wait
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>His last commands. Then, with a graceful mien,
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>Lights from her lofty steed the warrior queen:
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>Her squadron imitates, and each descends;
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>Whose common suit Camilla thus commends:
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>"If sense of honor, if a soul secure
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>Of inborn worth, that can all tests endure,
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>Can promise aught, or on itself rely
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Greatly to dare, to conquer or to die;
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>Then, I alone, sustain'd by these, will meet
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>The Tyrrhene troops, and promise their defeat.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>Ours be the danger, ours the sole renown:
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>You, gen'ral, stay behind, and guard the town:"
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>Turnus a while stood mute, with glad surprise,
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>And on the fierce virago fix'd his eyes;
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>Then thus return'd: "O grace of Italy,
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>With what becoming thanks can I reply?
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>Not only words lie lab'ring in my breast,
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>But thought itself is by thy praise oppress'd.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>Yet rob me not of all; but let me join
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>My toils, my hazard, and my fame, with thine.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>The Trojan, not in stratagem unskill'd,
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>Sends his light horse before to scour the field:
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>Himself, thro' steep ascents and thorny brakes,
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>A larger compass to the city takes.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>This news my scouts confirm, and I prepare
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>To foil his cunning, and his force to dare;
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>With chosen foot his passage to forelay,
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>And place an ambush in the winding way.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>Thou, with thy Volscians, face the Tuscan horse;
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>The brave Messapus shall thy troops inforce
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>With those of Tibur, and the Latian band,
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>Subjected all to thy supreme command."
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>This said, he warns Messapus to the war,
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>Then ev'ry chief exhorts with equal care.
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>All thus encourag'd, his own troops he joins,
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>And hastes to prosecute his deep designs.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>Inclos'd with hills, a winding valley lies,
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>By nature form'd for fraud, and fitted for surprise.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>A narrow track, by human steps untrode,
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>Leads, thro' perplexing thorns, to this obscure 
<A NAME="810"></A>abode.
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>High o'er the vale a steepy mountain stands,
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>The top is level, an offensive seat
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Of war; and from the war a safe retreat:
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>For, on the right and left, is room to press
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>The foes at hand, or from afar distress;
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>To drive 'em headlong downward, and to pour
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>On their descending backs a stony show'r.
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>Thither young Turnus took the well-known way,
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>Possess'd the pass, and in blind ambush lay.
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>Meantime Latonian Phoebe, from the skies,
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>Beheld th' approaching war with hateful eyes,
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>And call'd the light-foot Opis to her aid,
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Her most belov'd and ever-trusty maid;
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>Then with a sigh began: "Camilla goes
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>To meet her death amidst her fatal foes:
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>The nymphs I lov'd of all my mortal train,
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>Invested with Diana's arms, in vain.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>Nor is my kindness for the virgin new:
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>'T was born with her; and with her years it grew.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>Her father Metabus, when forc'd away
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>From old Privernum, for tyrannic sway,
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>Snatch'd up, and sav'd from his prevailing foes,
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>This tender babe, companion of his woes.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>Casmilla was her mother; but he drown'd
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>One hissing letter in a softer sound,
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>And call'd Camilla. Thro' the woods he flies;
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>Wrapp'd in his robe the royal infant lies.
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>His foes in sight, he mends his weary pace;
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>With shout and clamors they pursue the chase.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>The banks of Amasene at length he gains:
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>The raging flood his farther flight restrains,
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>Rais'd o'er the borders with unusual rains.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>Prepar'd to plunge into the stream, he fears,
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>Not for himself, but for the charge he bears.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>Anxious, he stops a while, and thinks in haste;
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>Then, desp'rate in distress, resolves at last.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>A knotty lance of well-boil'd oak he bore;
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>The middle part with cork he cover'd o'er:
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>He clos'd the child within the hollow space;
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>With twigs of bending osier bound the case;
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>Then pois'd the spear, heavy with human weight,
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>And thus invok'd my favor for the freight:
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>'Accept, great goddess of the woods,' he said,
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>'Sent by her sire, this dedicated maid!
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>Thro' air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine;
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>And the first weapons that she knows, are thine.'
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>He said; and with full force the spear he threw:
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>Above the sounding waves Camilla flew.
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>Then, press'd by foes, he stemm'd the stormy tide,
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>And gain'd, by stress of arms, the farther side.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>His fasten'd spear he pull'd from out the ground,
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>And, victor of his vows, his infant nymph unbound;
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>Nor, after that, in towns which walls inclose,
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>Would trust his hunted life amidst his foes;
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>But, rough, in open air he chose to lie;
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>Earth was his couch, his cov'ring was the sky.
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>On hills unshorn, or in a desart den,
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>He shunn'd the dire society of men.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>A shepherd's solitary life he led;
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>His daughter with the milk of mares he fed.
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>The dugs of bears, and ev'ry salvage beast,
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>He drew, and thro' her lips the liquor press'd.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>The little Amazon could scarcely go:
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>He loads her with a quiver and a bow;
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>And, that she might her stagg'ring steps command,
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>He with a slender jav'lin fills her hand.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>Her flowing hair no golden fillet bound;
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>Nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground.
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>Instead of these, a tiger's hide o'erspread
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>Her back and shoulders, fasten'd to her head.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>The flying dart she first attempts to fling,
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>And round her tender temples toss'd the sling;
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>Then, as her strength with years increas'd, began
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>To pierce aloft in air the soaring swan,
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>And from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>The Tuscan matrons with each other vied,
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>To bless their rival sons with such a bride;
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>But she disdains their love, to share with me
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>The sylvan shades and vow'd virginity.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>And, O! I wish, contented with my cares
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>Of salvage spoils, she had not sought the wars!
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>Then had she been of my celestial train,
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>And shunn'd the fate that dooms her to be slain.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>But since, opposing Heav'n's decree, she goes
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>To find her death among forbidden foes,
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>Haste with these arms, and take thy steepy flight.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>Where, with the gods, averse, the Latins fight.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>This bow to thee, this quiver I bequeath,
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>This chosen arrow, to revenge her death:
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>By whate'er hand Camilla shall be slain,
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>Or of the Trojan or Italian train,
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>Let him not pass unpunish'd from the plain.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>Then, in a hollow cloud, myself will aid
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>To bear the breathless body of my maid:
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>Unspoil'd shall be her arms, and unprofan'd
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>Her holy limbs with any human hand,
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>And in a marble tomb laid in her native land."
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>She said. The faithful nymph descends from high
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>With rapid flight, and cuts the sounding sky:
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>Black clouds and stormy winds around her body fly.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>By this, the Trojan and the Tuscan horse,
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>Drawn up in squadrons, with united force,
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>Approach the walls: the sprightly coursers bound,
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>Press forward on their bits, and shift their ground.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>Shields, arms, and spears flash horribly from far;
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>And the fields glitter with a waving war.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>Oppos'd to these, come on with furious force
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>Messapus, Coras, and the Latian horse;
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>These in the body plac'd, on either hand
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>Sustain'd and clos'd by fair Camilla's band.
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>Advancing in a line, they couch their spears;
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>And less and less the middle space appears.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>Thick smoke obscures the field; and scarce are seen
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>The neighing coursers, and the shouting men.
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>In distance of their darts they stop their course;
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>Then man to man they rush, and horse to horse.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>The face of heav'n their flying jav'lins hide,
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>And deaths unseen are dealt on either side.
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>Tyrrhenus, and Aconteus, void of fear,
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>By mettled coursers borne in full career,
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>Meet first oppos'd; and, with a mighty shock,
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>Their horses' heads against each other knock.
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>Far from his steed is fierce Aconteus cast,
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>As with an engine's force, or lightning's blast:
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>He rolls along in blood, and breathes his last.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>The Latin squadrons take a sudden fright,
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>And sling their shields behind, to save their backs in 
<A NAME="939"></A>flight
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>Spurring at speed to their own walls they drew;
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>Close in the rear the Tuscan troops pursue,
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>And urge their flight: Asylas leads the chase;
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>Till, seiz'd, with shame, they wheel about and face,
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>Receive their foes, and raise a threat'ning cry.
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>The Tuscans take their turn to fear and fly.
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>So swelling surges, with a thund'ring roar,
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>Driv'n on each other's backs, insult the shore,
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>Bound o'er the rocks, incroach upon the land,
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>And far upon the beach eject the sand;
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>Then backward, with a swing, they take their way,
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>Repuls'd from upper ground, and seek their mother 
<A NAME="952"></A>sea;
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>With equal hurry quit th' invaded shore,
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>And swallow back the sand and stones they spew'd 
<A NAME="955"></A>before.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>Twice were the Tuscans masters of the field,
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>Twice by the Latins, in their turn, repell'd.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>Asham'd at length, to the third charge they ran;
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>Both hosts resolv'd, and mingled man to man.
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>Now dying groans are heard; the fields are strow'd
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>With falling bodies, and are drunk with blood.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>Arms, horses, men, on heaps together lie:
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>Confus'd the fight, and more confus'd the cry.
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>Orsilochus, who durst not press too near
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>Strong Remulus, at distance drove his spear,
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>And stuck the steel beneath his horse's ear.
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>The fiery steed, impatient of the wound,
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>Curvets, and, springing upward with a bound,
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>His helpless lord cast backward on the ground.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>Catillus pierc'd Iolas first; then drew
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>His reeking lance, and at Herminius threw,
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>The mighty champion of the Tuscan crew.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>His neck and throat unarm'd, his head was bare,
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>But shaded with a length of yellow hair:
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>Secure, he fought, expos'd on ev'ry part,
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>A spacious mark for swords, and for the flying dart.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>Across the shoulders came the feather'd wound;
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>Transfix'd he fell, and doubled to the ground.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>The sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed,
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>And death with honor sought on either side.
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>Resistless thro' the war Camilla rode,
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>In danger unappall'd, and pleas'd with blood.
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>One side was bare for her exerted breast;
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>One shoulder with her painted quiver press'd.
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>Now from afar her fatal jav'lins play;
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>Now with her ax's edge she hews her way:
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>Diana's arms upon her shoulder sound;
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>And when, too closely press'd, she quits the ground,
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>From her bent bow she sends a backward wound.
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>Her maids, in martial pomp, on either side,
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>Larina, Tulla, fierce Tarpeia, ride:
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>Italians all; in peace, their queen's delight;
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>In war, the bold companions of the fight.
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>So march'd the Tracian Amazons of old,
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>When Thermodon with bloody billows roll'd:
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>Such troops as these in shining arms were seen,
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>When Theseus met in fight their maiden queen:
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>Such to the field Penthisilea led,
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>From the fierce virgin when the Grecians fled;
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>With such, return'd triumphant from the war,
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>Her maids with cries attend the lofty car;
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>They clash with manly force their moony shields;
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>With female shouts resound the Phrygian fields.
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>Who foremost, and who last, heroic maid,
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>On the cold earth were by thy courage laid?
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>Thy spear, of mountain ash, Eumenius first,
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>With fury driv'n, from side to side transpierc'd:
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>A purple stream came spouting from the wound;
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>Bath'd in his blood he lies, and bites the ground.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>Liris and Pegasus at once she slew:
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>The former, as the slacken'd reins he drew
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>Of his faint steed; the latter, as he stretch'd
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>His arm to prop his friend, the jav'lin reach'd.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>By the same weapon, sent from the same hand,
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>Both fall together, and both spurn the sand.
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>Amastrus next is added to the slain:
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>The rest in rout she follows o'er the plain:
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>Tereus, Harpalycus, Demophoon,
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>And Chromis, at full speed her fury shun.
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>Of all her deadly darts, not one she lost;
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>Each was attended with a Trojan ghost.
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>Young Ornithus bestrode a hunter steed,
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>Swift for the chase, and of Apulian breed.
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>Him from afar she spied, in arms unknown:
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>O'er his broad back an ox's hide was thrown;
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>His helm a wolf, whose gaping jaws were spread
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>A cov'ring for his cheeks, and grinn'd around his 
<A NAME="1028"></A>head,
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>He clench'd within his hand an iron prong,
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>And tower'd above the rest, conspicuous in the throng.
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>Him soon she singled from the flying train,
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>And slew with ease; then thus insults the slain:
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>"Vain hunter, didst thou think thro' woods to chase
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>The savage herd, a vile and trembling race?
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>Here cease thy vaunts, and own my victory:
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>A woman warrior was too strong for thee.
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>Yet, if the ghosts demand the conqu'ror's name,
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>Confessing great Camilla, save thy shame."
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>Then Butes and Orsilochus she slew,
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>The bulkiest bodies of the Trojan crew;
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>But Butes breast to breast: the spear descends
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>Above the gorget, where his helmet ends,
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>And o'er the shield which his left side defends.
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>Orsilochus and she their courses ply:
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>He seems to follow, and she seems to fly;
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>But in a narrower ring she makes the race;
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>And then he flies, and she pursues the chase.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>Gath'ring at length on her deluded foe,
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>She swings her ax, and rises to the blow
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>Full on the helm behind, with such a sway
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>The weapon falls, the riven steel gives way:
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>He groans, he roars, he sues in vain for grace;
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>Brains, mingled with his blood, besmear his face.
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>Astonish'd Aunus just arrives by chance,
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>To see his fall; nor farther dares advance;
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>But, fixing on the horrid maid his eye,
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>He stares, and shakes, and finds it vain to fly;
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>Yet, like a true Ligurian, born to cheat,
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>(At least while fortune favor'd his deceit,)
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>Cries out aloud: "What courage have you shown,
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>Who trust your courser's strength, and not your 
<A NAME="1062"></A>own?
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>Forego the vantage of your horse, alight,
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>And then on equal terms begin the fight:
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>It shall be seen, weak woman, what you can,
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>When, foot to foot, you combat with a man,"
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>He said. She glows with anger and disdain,
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>Dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain,
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>And leaves her horse at large among her train;
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>With her drawn sword defies him to the field,
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>And, marching, lifts aloft her maiden shield.
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>The youth, who thought his cunning did succeed,
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>Reins round his horse, and urges all his speed;
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>Adds the remembrance of the spur, and hides
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>The goring rowels in his bleeding sides.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>"Vain fool, and coward!" cries the lofty maid,
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>"Caught in the train which thou thyself hast laid!
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>On others practice thy Ligurian arts;
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>Thin stratagems and tricks of little hearts
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>Are lost on me: nor shalt thou safe retire,
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>With vaunting lies, to thy fallacious sire."
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>At this, so fast her flying feet she sped,
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>That soon she strain'd beyond his horse's head:
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>Then turning short, at once she seiz'd the rein,
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>And laid the boaster grov'ling on the plain.
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>Not with more ease the falcon, from above,
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>Trusses in middle air the trembling dove,
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>Then plumes the prey, in her strong pounces bound:
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>The feathers, foul with blood, come tumbling to the 
<A NAME="1090"></A>ground.
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>Now mighty Jove, from his superior height,
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>With his broad eye surveys th' unequal fight.
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>He fires the breast of Tarchon with disdain,
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>And sends him to redeem th' abandon'd plain.
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>Betwixt the broken ranks the Tuscan rides,
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>And these encourages, and those he chides;
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>Recalls each leader, by his name, from flight;
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>Renews their ardor, and restores the fight.
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>"What panic fear has seiz'd your souls? O shame,
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>O brand perpetual of th' Etrurian name!
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>Cowards incurable, a woman's hand
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>Drives, breaks, and scatters your ignoble band!
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>Now cast away the sword, and quit the shield!
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>What use of weapons which you dare not wield?
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>Not thus you fly your female foes by night,
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>Nor shun the feast, when the full bowls invite;
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>When to fat off'rings the glad augur calls,
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>And the shrill hornpipe sounds to bacchanals.
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>These are your studied cares, your lewd delight:
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>Swift to debauch, but slow to manly fight."
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>Thus having said, he spurs amid the foes,
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>Not managing the life he meant to lose.
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>The first he found he seiz'd with headlong haste,
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>In his strong gripe, and clasp'd around the waist;
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>'T was Venulus, whom from his horse he tore,
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>And, laid athwart his own, in triumph bore.
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>Loud shouts ensue; the Latins turn their eyes,
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>And view th' unusual sight with vast surprise.
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>The fiery Tarchon, flying o'er the plains,
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>Press'd in his arms the pond'rous prey sustains;
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>Then, with his shorten'd spear, explores around
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>His jointed arms, to fix a deadly wound.
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>Nor less the captive struggles for his life:
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>He writhes his body to prolong the strife,
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>And, fencing for his naked throat, exerts
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>His utmost vigor, and the point averts.
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>So stoops the yellow eagle from on high,
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>And bears a speckled serpent thro' the sky,
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>Fast'ning his crooked talons on the prey:
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>The pris'ner hisses thro' the liquid way;
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>Resists the royal hawk; and, tho' oppress'd,
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>She fights in volumes, and erects her crest:
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>Turn'd to her foe, she stiffens ev'ry scale,
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>And shoots her forky tongue, and whisks her threat'ning 
<A NAME="1135"></A>tail.
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>Against the victor, all defense is weak:
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>Th' imperial bird still plies her with his beak;
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR>He tears her bowels, and her breast he gores;
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>Then claps his pinions, and securely soars.
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>Thus, thro' the midst of circling enemies,
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR>Strong Tarchon snatch'd and bore away his prize.
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>The Tyrrhene troops, that shrunk before, now press
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>The Latins, and presume the like success.
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR>Then Aruns, doom'd to death, his arts assay'd,
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR>To murther, unespied, the Volscian maid:
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>This way and that his winding course he bends,
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>And, whereso'er she turns, her steps attends.
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR>When she retires victorious from the chase,
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR>He wheels about with care, and shifts his place;
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR>When, rushing on, she seeks her foes flight,
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR>He keeps aloof, but keeps her still in sight:
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR>He threats, and trembles, trying ev'ry way,
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR>Unseen to kill, and safely to betray.
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR>Chloreus, the priest of Cybele, from far,
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>Glitt'ring in Phrygian arms amidst the war,
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR>Was by the virgin view'd. The steed he press'd
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR>Was proud with trappings, and his brawny chest
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR>With scales of gilded brass was cover'd o'er;
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR>A robe of Tyrian dye the rider wore.
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR>With deadly wounds he gall'd the distant foe;
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR>Gnossian his shafts, and Lycian was his bow:
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>A golden helm his front and head surrounds
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR>A gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds.
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR>Gold, weav'd with linen, on his thighs he wore,
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR>With flowers of needlework distinguish'd o'er,
<A NAME="1166"></A><BR>With golden buckles bound, and gather'd up before.
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR>Him the fierce maid beheld with ardent eyes,
<A NAME="1168"></A><BR>Fond and ambitious of so rich a prize,
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR>Or that the temple might his trophies hold,
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR>Or else to shine herself in Trojan gold.
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR>Blind in her haste, she chases him alone.
<A NAME="1172"></A><BR>And seeks his life, regardless of her own.
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR>This lucky moment the sly traitor chose:
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR>Then, starting from his ambush, up he rose,
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR>And threw, but first to Heav'n address'd his vows:
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR>"O patron of Socrates' high abodes,
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR>Phoebus, the ruling pow'r among the gods,
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR>Whom first we serve, whole woods of unctuous pine
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR>Are fell'd for thee, and to thy glory shine;
<A NAME="1180"></A><BR>By thee protected with our naked soles,
<A NAME="1181"></A><BR>Thro' flames unsing'd we march, and tread the kindled 
<A NAME="1182"></A>coals
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR>Give me, propitious pow'r, to wash away
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR>The stains of this dishonorable day:
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR>Nor spoils, nor triumph, from the fact I claim,
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>But with my future actions trust my fame.
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR>Let me, by stealth, this female plague o'ercome,
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR>And from the field return inglorious home."
<A NAME="1189"></A><BR>Apollo heard, and, granting half his pray'r,
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR>Shuffled in winds the rest, and toss'd in empty 
<A NAME="1191"></A>air.
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR>He gives the death desir'd; his safe return
<A NAME="1193"></A><BR>By southern tempests to the seas is borne.
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR>Now, when the jav'lin whizz'd along the skies,
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR>Both armies on Camilla turn'd their eyes,
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR>Directed by the sound. Of either host,
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR>Th' unhappy virgin, tho' concern'd the most,
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR>Was only deaf; so greedy was she bent
<A NAME="1199"></A><BR>On golden spoils, and on her prey intent;
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR>Till in her pap the winged weapon stood
<A NAME="1201"></A><BR>Infix'd, and deeply drunk the purple blood.
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR>Her sad attendants hasten to sustain
<A NAME="1203"></A><BR>Their dying lady, drooping on the plain.
<A NAME="1204"></A><BR>Far from their sight the trembling Aruns flies,
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR>With beating heart, and fear confus'd with joys;
<A NAME="1206"></A><BR>Nor dares he farther to pursue his blow,
<A NAME="1207"></A><BR>Or ev'n to bear the sight of his expiring foe.
<A NAME="1208"></A><BR>As, when the wolf has torn a bullock's hide
<A NAME="1209"></A><BR>At unawares, or ranch'd a shepherd's side,
<A NAME="1210"></A><BR>Conscious of his audacious deed, he flies,
<A NAME="1211"></A><BR>And claps his quiv'ring tail between his thighs:
<A NAME="1212"></A><BR>So, speeding once, the wretch no more attends,
<A NAME="1213"></A><BR>But, spurring forward, herds among his friends.
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR>She wrench'd the jav'lin with her dying hands,
<A NAME="1215"></A><BR>But wedg'd within her breast the weapon stands;
<A NAME="1216"></A><BR>The wood she draws, the steely point remains;
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR>She staggers in her seat with agonizing pains:
<A NAME="1218"></A><BR>(A gath'ring mist o'erclouds her cheerful eyes,
<A NAME="1219"></A><BR>And from her cheeks the rosy color flies:)
<A NAME="1220"></A><BR>Then turns to her, whom of her female train
<A NAME="1221"></A><BR>She trusted most, and thus she speaks with pain:
<A NAME="1222"></A><BR>"Acca, 't is past! he swims before my sight,
<A NAME="1223"></A><BR>Inexorable Death; and claims his right.
<A NAME="1224"></A><BR>Bear my last words to Turnus; fly with speed,
<A NAME="1225"></A><BR>And bid him timely to my charge succeed,
<A NAME="1226"></A><BR>Repel the Trojans, and the town relieve:
<A NAME="1227"></A><BR>Farewell! and in this kiss my parting breath receive."
<A NAME="1228"></A><BR>She said, and, sliding, sunk upon the plain:
<A NAME="1229"></A><BR>Dying, her open'd hand forsakes the rein;
<A NAME="1230"></A><BR>Short, and more short, she pants; by slow degrees
<A NAME="1231"></A><BR>Her mind the passage from her body frees.
<A NAME="1232"></A><BR>She drops her sword; she nods her plumy crest,
<A NAME="1233"></A><BR>Her drooping head declining on her breast:
<A NAME="1234"></A><BR>In the last sigh her struggling soul expires,
<A NAME="1235"></A><BR>And, murm'ring with disdain, to Stygian sounds retires.
<A NAME="1236"></A><BR>A shout, that struck the golden stars, ensued;
<A NAME="1237"></A><BR>Despair and rage the languish'd fight renew'd.
<A NAME="1238"></A><BR>The Trojan troops and Tuscans, in a line,
<A NAME="1239"></A><BR>Advance to charge; the mix'd Arcadians join.
<A NAME="1240"></A><BR>But Cynthia's maid, high seated, from afar
<A NAME="1241"></A><BR>Surveys the field, and fortune of the war,
<A NAME="1242"></A><BR>Unmov'd a while, till, prostrate on the plain,
<A NAME="1243"></A><BR>Welt'ring in blood, she sees Camilla slain,
<A NAME="1244"></A><BR>And, round her corpse, of friends and foes a fighting 
<A NAME="1245"></A>train.
<A NAME="1246"></A><BR>Then, from the bottom of her breast, she drew
<A NAME="1247"></A><BR>A mournful sigh, and these sad words ensue:
<A NAME="1248"></A><BR>"Too dear a fine, ah much lamented maid,
<A NAME="1249"></A><BR>For warring with the Trojans, thou hast paid!
<A NAME="1250"></A><BR>Nor aught avail'd, in this unhappy strife,
<A NAME="1251"></A><BR>Diana's sacred arms, to save thy life.
<A NAME="1252"></A><BR>Yet unreveng'd thy goddess will not leave
<A NAME="1253"></A><BR>Her vot'ry's death, nor; with vain sorrow grieve.
<A NAME="1254"></A><BR>Branded the wretch, and be his name abhorr'd;
<A NAME="1255"></A><BR>But after ages shall thy praise record.
<A NAME="1256"></A><BR>Th' inglorious coward soon shall press the plain:
<A NAME="1257"></A><BR>Thus vows thy queen, and thus the Fates ordain."
<A NAME="1258"></A><BR>High o'er the field there stood a hilly mound,
<A NAME="1259"></A><BR>Sacred the place, and spread with oaks around,
<A NAME="1260"></A><BR>Where, in a marble tomb, Dercennus lay,
<A NAME="1261"></A><BR>A king that once in Latium bore the sway.
<A NAME="1262"></A><BR>The beauteous Opis thither bent her flight,
<A NAME="1263"></A><BR>To mark the traitor Aruns from the height.
<A NAME="1264"></A><BR>Him in refulgent arms she soon espied,
<A NAME="1265"></A><BR>Swoln with success; and loudly thus she cried:
<A NAME="1266"></A><BR>"Thy backward steps, vain boaster, are too late;
<A NAME="1267"></A><BR>Turn like a man, at length, and meet thy fate.
<A NAME="1268"></A><BR>Charg'd with my message, to Camilla go,
<A NAME="1269"></A><BR>And say I sent thee to the shades below,
<A NAME="1270"></A><BR>An honor undeserv'd from Cynthia's bow."
<A NAME="1271"></A><BR>She said, and from her quiver chose with speed
<A NAME="1272"></A><BR>The winged shaft, predestin'd for the deed;
<A NAME="1273"></A><BR>Then to the stubborn yew her strength applied,
<A NAME="1274"></A><BR>Till the far distant horns approach'd on either 
<A NAME="1275"></A>side.
<A NAME="1276"></A><BR>The bowstring touch'd her breast, so strong she 
<A NAME="1277"></A>drew;
<A NAME="1278"></A><BR>Whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew.
<A NAME="1279"></A><BR>At once the twanging bow and sounding dart
<A NAME="1280"></A><BR>The traitor heard, and felt the point within his 
<A NAME="1281"></A>heart.
<A NAME="1282"></A><BR>Him, beating with his heels in pangs of death,
<A NAME="1283"></A><BR>His flying friends to foreign fields bequeath.
<A NAME="1284"></A><BR>The conqu'ring damsel, with expanded wings,
<A NAME="1285"></A><BR>The welcome message to her mistress brings.
<A NAME="1286"></A><BR>Their leader lost, the Volscians quit the field,
<A NAME="1287"></A><BR>And, unsustain'd, the chiefs of Turnus yield.
<A NAME="1288"></A><BR>The frighted soldiers, when their captains fly,
<A NAME="1289"></A><BR>More on their speed than on their strength rely.
<A NAME="1290"></A><BR>Confus'd in flight, they bear each other down,
<A NAME="1291"></A><BR>And spur their horses headlong to the town.
<A NAME="1292"></A><BR>Driv'n by their foes, and to their fears resign'd,
<A NAME="1293"></A><BR>Not once they turn, but take their wounds behind.
<A NAME="1294"></A><BR>These drop the shield, and those the lance forego,
<A NAME="1295"></A><BR>Or on their shoulders bear the slacken'd bow.
<A NAME="1296"></A><BR>The hoofs of horses, with a rattling sound,
<A NAME="1297"></A><BR>Beat short and thick, and shake the rotten ground.
<A NAME="1298"></A><BR>Black clouds of dust come rolling in the sky,
<A NAME="1299"></A><BR>And o'er the darken'd walls and rampires fly.
<A NAME="1300"></A><BR>The trembling matrons, from their lofty stands,
<A NAME="1301"></A><BR>Rend heav'n with female shrieks, and wring their 
<A NAME="1302"></A>hands.
<A NAME="1303"></A><BR>All pressing on, pursuers and pursued,
<A NAME="1304"></A><BR>Are crush'd in crowds, a mingled multitude.
<A NAME="1305"></A><BR>Some happy few escape: the throng too late
<A NAME="1306"></A><BR>Rush on for entrance, till they choke the gate.
<A NAME="1307"></A><BR>Ev'n in the sight of home, the wretched sire
<A NAME="1308"></A><BR>Looks on, and sees his helpless son expire.
<A NAME="1309"></A><BR>Then, in a fright, the folding gates they close,
<A NAME="1310"></A><BR>But leave their friends excluded with their foes.
<A NAME="1311"></A><BR>The vanquish'd cry; the victors loudly shout;
<A NAME="1312"></A><BR>'T is terror all within, and slaughter all without.
<A NAME="1313"></A><BR>Blind in their fear, they bounce against the wall,
<A NAME="1314"></A><BR>Or, to the moats pursued, precipitate their fall.
<A NAME="1315"></A><BR>The Latian virgins, valiant with despair,
<A NAME="1316"></A><BR>Arm'd on the tow'rs, the common danger share:
<A NAME="1317"></A><BR>So much of zeal their country's cause inspir'd;
<A NAME="1318"></A><BR>So much Camilla's great example fir'd.
<A NAME="1319"></A><BR>Poles, sharpen'd in the flames, from high they throw,
<A NAME="1320"></A><BR>With imitated darts, to gall the foe.
<A NAME="1321"></A><BR>Their lives for godlike freedom they bequeath,
<A NAME="1322"></A><BR>And crowd each other to be first in death.
<A NAME="1323"></A><BR>Meantime to Turnus, ambush'd in the shade,
<A NAME="1324"></A><BR>With heavy tidings came th' unhappy maid:
<A NAME="1325"></A><BR>"The Volscians overthrown, Camilla kill'd;
<A NAME="1326"></A><BR>The foes, entirely masters of the field,
<A NAME="1327"></A><BR>Like a resistless flood, come rolling on:
<A NAME="1328"></A><BR>The cry goes off the plain, and thickens to the 
<A NAME="1329"></A>town."
<A NAME="1330"></A><BR>Inflam'd with rage, (for so the Furies fire
<A NAME="1331"></A><BR>The Daunian's breast, and so the Fates require,)
<A NAME="1332"></A><BR>He leaves the hilly pass, the woods in vain
<A NAME="1333"></A><BR>Possess'd, and downward issues on the plain.
<A NAME="1334"></A><BR>Scarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed
<A NAME="1335"></A><BR>From secret foes, the Trojan troops succeed.
<A NAME="1336"></A><BR>Thro' the black forest and the ferny brake,
<A NAME="1337"></A><BR>Unknowingly secure, their way they take;
<A NAME="1338"></A><BR>From the rough mountains to the plain descend,
<A NAME="1339"></A><BR>And there, in order drawn, their line extend.
<A NAME="1340"></A><BR>Both armies now in open fields are seen;
<A NAME="1341"></A><BR>Nor far the distance of the space between.
<A NAME="1342"></A><BR>Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees,
<A NAME="1343"></A><BR>Thro' smoking fields, his hast'ning enemies;
<A NAME="1344"></A><BR>And Turnus views the Trojans in array,
<A NAME="1345"></A><BR>And hears th' approaching horses proudly neigh.
<A NAME="1346"></A><BR>Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join'd;
<A NAME="1347"></A><BR>But westward to the sea the sun declin'd.
<A NAME="1348"></A><BR>Intrench'd before the town both armies lie,
<A NAME="1349"></A><BR>While Night with sable wings involves the sky.
