<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc'd by fate,
<A NAME="11"></A><BR>And haughty Juno's unrelenting hate,
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>Expell'd and exil'd, left the Trojan shore.
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Long labors, both by sea and land, he bore,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>And in the doubtful war, before he won
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>The Latian realm, and built the destin'd town;
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>His banish'd gods restor'd to rites divine,
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>And settled sure succession in his line,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>From whence the race of Alban fathers come,
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>And the long glories of majestic Rome.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate;
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>What goddess was provok'd, and whence her hate;
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>To persecute so brave, so just a man;
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Involv'd his anxious life in endless cares,
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Expos'd to wants, and hurried into wars!
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Can heav'nly minds such high resentment show,
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Or exercise their spite in human woe?
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Against the Tiber's mouth, but far away,
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>An ancient town was seated on the sea;
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>A Tyrian colony; the people made
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Stout for the war, and studious of their trade:
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Carthage the name; belov'd by Juno more
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Here stood her chariot; here, if Heav'n were kind,
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>The seat of awful empire she design'd.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>Yet she had heard an ancient rumor fly,
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>(Long cited by the people of the sky,)
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>That times to come should see the Trojan race
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Her Carthage ruin, and her tow'rs deface;
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Nor thus confin'd, the yoke of sov'reign sway
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Should on the necks of all the nations lay.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>She ponder'd this, and fear'd it was in fate;
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Nor could forget the war she wag'd of late
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>For conqu'ring Greece against the Trojan state.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Besides, long causes working in her mind,
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>And secret seeds of envy, lay behind;
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>Deep graven in her heart the doom remain'd
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Of partial Paris, and her form disdain'd;
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>The grace bestow'd on ravish'd Ganymed,
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Electra's glories, and her injur'd bed.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Each was a cause alone; and all combin'd
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>For this, far distant from the Latian coast
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>She drove the remnants of the Trojan host;
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>And sev'n long years th' unhappy wand'ring train
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Were toss'd by storms, and scatter'd thro' the main.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>Such time, such toil, requir'd the Roman name,
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Such length of labor for so vast a frame.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>Now scarce the Trojan fleet, with sails and oars,
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Had left behind the fair Sicilian shores,
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>Ent'ring with cheerful shouts the wat'ry reign,
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>And plowing frothy furrows in the main;
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>When, lab'ring still with endless discontent,
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>The Queen of Heav'n did thus her fury vent:
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>"Then am I vanquish'd? must I yield?" said she,
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>"And must the Trojans reign in Italy?
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>So Fate will have it, and Jove adds his force;
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Nor can my pow'r divert their happy course.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Could angry Pallas, with revengeful spleen,
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>The Grecian navy burn, and drown the men?
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>She, for the fault of one offending foe,
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>The bolts of Jove himself presum'd to throw:
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>With whirlwinds from beneath she toss'd the ship,
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>And bare expos'd the bosom of the deep;
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Then, as an eagle gripes the trembling game,
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>The wretch, yet hissing with her father's flame,
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>She strongly seiz'd, and with a burning wound
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Transfix'd, and naked, on a rock she bound.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>But I, who walk in awful state above,
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>The majesty of heav'n, the sister wife of Jove,
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>For length of years my fruitless force employ
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Against the thin remains of ruin'd Troy!
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>What nations now to Juno's pow'r will pray,
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Or off'rings on my slighted altars lay?"
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Thus rag'd the goddess; and, with fury fraught.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>The restless regions of the storms she sought,
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Where, in a spacious cave of living stone,
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>The tyrant Aeolus, from his airy throne,
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>With pow'r imperial curbs the struggling winds,
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>This way and that th' impatient captives tend,
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>And, pressing for release, the mountains rend.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>High in his hall th' undaunted monarch stands,
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>And shakes his scepter, and their rage commands;
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Which did he not, their unresisted sway
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>Would sweep the world before them in their way;
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Earth, air, and seas thro' empty space would roll,
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>And heav'n would fly before the driving soul.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>In fear of this, the Father of the Gods
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Confin'd their fury to those dark abodes,
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>And lock'd 'em safe within, oppress'd with mountain 
<A NAME="102"></A>loads;
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Impos'd a king, with arbitrary sway,
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>To loose their fetters, or their force allay.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>To whom the suppliant queen her pray'rs address'd,
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>And thus the tenor of her suit express'd:
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>"O Aeolus! for to thee the King of Heav'n
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>The pow'r of tempests and of winds has giv'n;
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Thy force alone their fury can restrain,
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>And smooth the waves, or swell the troubled main-
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>A race of wand'ring slaves, abhorr'd by me,
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>With prosp'rous passage cut the Tuscan sea;
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>To fruitful Italy their course they steer,
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>And for their vanquish'd gods design new temples 
<A NAME="115"></A>there.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Raise all thy winds; with night involve the skies;
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>Sink or disperse my fatal enemies.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Twice sev'n, the charming daughters of the main,
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Around my person wait, and bear my train:
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Succeed my wish, and second my design;
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>The fairest, Deiopeia, shall be thine,
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>And make thee father of a happy line."
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>To this the god: "'T is yours, O queen, to will
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>The work which duty binds me to fulfil.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>These airy kingdoms, and this wide command,
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Are all the presents of your bounteous hand:
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Yours is my sov'reign's grace; and, as your guest,
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>I sit with gods at their celestial feast;
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Raise tempests at your pleasure, or subdue;
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Dispose of empire, which I hold from you."
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>He said, and hurl'd against the mountain side
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>His quiv'ring spear, and all the god applied.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>The raging winds rush thro' the hollow wound,
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>And dance aloft in air, and skim along the ground;
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Then, settling on the sea, the surges sweep,
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Raise liquid mountains, and disclose the deep.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>South, East, and West with mix'd confusion roar,
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>And roll the foaming billows to the shore.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>The cables crack; the sailors' fearful cries
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>Ascend; and sable night involves the skies;
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>And heav'n itself is ravish'd from their eyes.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue;
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Then flashing fires the transient light renew;
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>The face of things a frightful image bears,
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>And present death in various forms appears.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>Struck with unusual fright, the Trojan chief,
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>With lifted hands and eyes, invokes relief;
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>And, "Thrice and four times happy those," he cried,
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>"That under Ilian walls before their parents died!
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Tydides, bravest of the Grecian train!
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Why could not I by that strong arm be slain,
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>And lie by noble Hector on the plain,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Or great Sarpedon, in those bloody fields
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>Where Simois rolls the bodies and the shields
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Of heroes, whose dismember'd hands yet bear
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>The dart aloft, and clench the pointed spear!"
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>Thus while the pious prince his fate bewails,
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Fierce Boreas drove against his flying sails,
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>And rent the sheets; the raging billows rise,
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>And mount the tossing vessels to the skies:
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Nor can the shiv'ring oars sustain the blow;
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>The galley gives her side, and turns her prow;
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>While those astern, descending down the steep,
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Thro' gaping waves behold the boiling deep.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Three ships were hurried by the southern blast,
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>And on the secret shelves with fury cast.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>Those hidden rocks th' Ausonian sailors knew:
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>They call'd them Altars, when they rose in view,
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>And show'd their spacious backs above the flood.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Three more fierce Eurus, in his angry mood,
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Dash'd on the shallows of the moving sand,
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>And in mid ocean left them moor'd aland.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>Orontes' bark, that bore the Lycian crew,
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>(A horrid sight!) ev'n in the hero's view,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>From stem to stern by waves was overborne:
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>The trembling pilot, from his rudder torn,
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Was headlong hurl'd; thrice round the ship was toss'd,
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>Then bulg'd at once, and in the deep was lost;
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>And here and there above the waves were seen
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Arms, pictures, precious goods, and floating men.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>The stoutest vessel to the storm gave way,
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>And suck'd thro' loosen'd planks the rushing sea.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Ilioneus was her chief: Alethes old,
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>Achates faithful, Abas young and bold,
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Endur'd not less; their ships, with gaping seams,
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>Admit the deluge of the briny streams.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Meantime imperial Neptune heard the sound
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Of raging billows breaking on the ground.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Displeas'd, and fearing for his wat'ry reign,
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>He rear'd his awful head above the main,
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Serene in majesty; then roll'd his eyes
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Around the space of earth, and seas, and skies.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>He saw the Trojan fleet dispers'd, distress'd,
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>By stormy winds and wintry heav'n oppress'd.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Full well the god his sister's envy knew,
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>And what her aims and what her arts pursue.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>He summon'd Eurus and the western blast,
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>And first an angry glance on both he cast;
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Then thus rebuk'd: "Audacious winds! from whence
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>This bold attempt, this rebel insolence?
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Is it for you to ravage seas and land,
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Unauthoriz'd by my supreme command?
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>To raise such mountains on the troubled main?
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Whom I- but first 't is fit the billows to restrain;
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>And then you shall be taught obedience to my reign.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Hence! to your lord my royal mandate bear-
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>The realms of ocean and the fields of air
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Are mine, not his. By fatal lot to me
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>The liquid empire fell, and trident of the sea.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>His pow'r to hollow caverns is confin'd:
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>There let him reign, the jailer of the wind,
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>With hoarse commands his breathing subjects call,
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>And boast and bluster in his empty hall."
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>He spoke; and, while he spoke, he smooth'd the sea,
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Dispell'd the darkness, and restor'd the day.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Cymothoe, Triton, and the sea-green train
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Of beauteous nymphs, the daughters of the main,
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Clear from the rocks the vessels with their hands:
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>The god himself with ready trident stands,
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>And opes the deep, and spreads the moving sands;
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Then heaves them off the shoals. Where'er he guides
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>His finny coursers and in triumph rides,
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>The waves unruffle and the sea subsides.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>As, when in tumults rise th' ignoble crowd,
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>Mad are their motions, and their tongues are loud;
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>And stones and brands in rattling volleys fly,
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>And all the rustic arms that fury can supply:
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>If then some grave and pious man appear,
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>They hush their noise, and lend a list'ning ear;
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>He soothes with sober words their angry mood,
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>And quenches their innate desire of blood:
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>So, when the Father of the Flood appears,
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>And o'er the seas his sov'reign trident rears,
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>Their fury falls: he skims the liquid plains,
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>High on his chariot, and, with loosen'd reins,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Majestic moves along, and awful peace maintains.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>The weary Trojans ply their shatter'd oars
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>To nearest land, and make the Libyan shores.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Within a long recess there lies a bay:
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>An island shades it from the rolling sea,
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>And forms a port secure for ships to ride;
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Broke by the jutting land, on either side,
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>In double streams the briny waters glide.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Appears above, and groves for ever green:
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>A grot is form'd beneath, with mossy seats,
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>To rest the Nereids, and exclude the heats.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Down thro' the crannies of the living walls
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>The crystal streams descend in murm'ring falls:
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>No haulsers need to bind the vessels here,
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Nor bearded anchors; for no storms they fear.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Sev'n ships within this happy harbor meet,
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>The thin remainders of the scatter'd fleet.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>The Trojans, worn with toils, and spent with woes,
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Leap on the welcome land, and seek their wish'd 
<A NAME="256"></A>repose.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>First, good Achates, with repeated strokes
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Of clashing flints, their hidden fire provokes:
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Short flame succeeds; a bed of wither'd leaves
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>The dying sparkles in their fall receives:
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Caught into life, in fiery fumes they rise,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>And, fed with stronger food, invade the skies.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>The Trojans, dropping wet, or stand around
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>The cheerful blaze, or lie along the ground:
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Some dry their corn, infected with the brine,
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>Then grind with marbles, and prepare to dine.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Aeneas climbs the mountain's airy brow,
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>And takes a prospect of the seas below,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>If Capys thence, or Antheus he could spy,
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Or see the streamers of Caicus fly.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>No vessels were in view; but, on the plain,
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Three beamy stags command a lordly train
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Of branching heads: the more ignoble throng
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Attend their stately steps, and slowly graze along.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>He stood; and, while secure they fed below,
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>He took the quiver and the trusty bow
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Achates us'd to bear: the leaders first
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>He laid along, and then the vulgar pierc'd;
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>Nor ceas'd his arrows, till the shady plain
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Sev'n mighty bodies with their blood distain.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>For the sev'n ships he made an equal share,
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>And to the port return'd, triumphant from the war.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>The jars of gen'rous wine (Acestes' gift,
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>When his Trinacrian shores the navy left)
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>He set abroach, and for the feast prepar'd,
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>In equal portions with the ven'son shar'd.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Thus while he dealt it round, the pious chief
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>With cheerful words allay'd the common grief:
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>"Endure, and conquer! Jove will soon dispose
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>To future good our past and present woes.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>With me, the rocks of Scylla you have tried;
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Th' inhuman Cyclops and his den defied.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>What greater ills hereafter can you bear?
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>Resume your courage and dismiss your care,
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>An hour will come, with pleasure to relate
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Your sorrows past, as benefits of Fate.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>Thro' various hazards and events, we move
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>To Latium and the realms foredoom'd by Jove.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Call'd to the seat (the promise of the skies)
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>Where Trojan kingdoms once again may rise,
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Endure the hardships of your present state;
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Live, and reserve yourselves for better fate."
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>These words he spoke, but spoke not from his heart;
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>His outward smiles conceal'd his inward smart.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>The jolly crew, unmindful of the past,
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>The quarry share, their plenteous dinner haste.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Some strip the skin; some portion out the spoil;
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>The limbs, yet trembling, in the caldrons boil;
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Some on the fire the reeking entrails broil.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Stretch'd on the grassy turf, at ease they dine,
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Restore their strength with meat, and cheer their souls with 
<A NAME="312"></A>wine.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>Their hunger thus appeas'd, their care attends
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>The doubtful fortune of their absent friends:
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>Alternate hopes and fears their minds possess,
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Whether to deem 'em dead, or in distress.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Above the rest, Aeneas mourns the fate
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Of brave Orontes, and th' uncertain state
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Of Gyas, Lycus, and of Amycus.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>The day, but not their sorrows, ended thus.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>When, from aloft, almighty Jove surveys
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Earth, air, and shores, and navigable seas,
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>At length on Libyan realms he fix'd his eyes-
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>Whom, pond'ring thus on human miseries,
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>When Venus saw, she with a lowly look,
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Not free from tears, her heav'nly sire bespoke:
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>"O King of Gods and Men! whose awful hand
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Disperses thunder on the seas and land,
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Disposing all with absolute command;
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>How could my pious son thy pow'r incense?
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Or what, alas! is vanish'd Troy's offense?
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Our hope of Italy not only lost,
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>On various seas by various tempests toss'd,
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>But shut from ev'ry shore, and barr'd from ev'ry 
<A NAME="335"></A>coast.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>You promis'd once, a progeny divine
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Of Romans, rising from the Trojan line,
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>In after times should hold the world in awe,
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>And to the land and ocean give the law.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>How is your doom revers'd, which eas'd my care
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>When Troy was ruin'd in that cruel war?
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>Then fates to fates I could oppose; but now,
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>When Fortune still pursues her former blow,
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>What can I hope? What worse can still succeed?
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>What end of labors has your will decreed?
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>Antenor, from the midst of Grecian hosts,
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>Could pass secure, and pierce th' Illyrian coasts,
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Where, rolling down the steep, Timavus raves
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>And thro' nine channels disembogues his waves.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>At length he founded Padua's happy seat,
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>And gave his Trojans a secure retreat;
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>There fix'd their arms, and there renew'd their 
<A NAME="353"></A>name,
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>And there in quiet rules, and crown'd with fame.
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>But we, descended from your sacred line,
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Entitled to your heav'n and rites divine,
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Are banish'd earth; and, for the wrath of one,
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Remov'd from Latium and the promis'd throne.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Are these our scepters? these our due rewards?
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>And is it thus that Jove his plighted faith regards?"
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>To whom the Father of th' immortal race,
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Smiling with that serene indulgent face,
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>With which he drives the clouds and clears the skies,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>First gave a holy kiss; then thus replies:
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>"Daughter, dismiss thy fears; to thy desire
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>The fates of thine are fix'd, and stand entire.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>Thou shalt behold thy wish'd Lavinian walls;
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>And, ripe for heav'n, when fate Aeneas calls,
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>Then shalt thou bear him up, sublime, to me:
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>No councils have revers'd my firm decree.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>And, lest new fears disturb thy happy state,
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>Know, I have search'd the mystic rolls of Fate:
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Thy son (nor is th' appointed season far)
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>In Italy shall wage successful war,
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>Shall tame fierce nations in the bloody field,
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>And sov'reign laws impose, and cities build,
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Till, after ev'ry foe subdued, the sun
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Thrice thro' the signs his annual race shall run:
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>This is his time prefix'd. Ascanius then,
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Now call'd Iulus, shall begin his reign.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>He thirty rolling years the crown shall wear,
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Then from Lavinium shall the seat transfer,
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>And, with hard labor, Alba Longa build.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>The throne with his succession shall be fill'd
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Three hundred circuits more: then shall be seen
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Ilia the fair, a priestess and a queen,
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Who, full of Mars, in time, with kindly throes,
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Shall at a birth two goodly boys disclose.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>The royal babes a tawny wolf shall drain:
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Then Romulus his grandsire's throne shall gain,
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>Of martial tow'rs the founder shall become,
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>The people Romans call, the city Rome.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>To them no bounds of empire I assign,
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>Nor term of years to their immortal line.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Ev'n haughty Juno, who, with endless broils,
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>Earth, seas, and heav'n, and Jove himself turmoils;
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>At length aton'd, her friendly pow'r shall join,
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>To cherish and advance the Trojan line.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>The subject world shall Rome's dominion own,
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>And, prostrate, shall adore the nation of the gown.
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>An age is ripening in revolving fate
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>When Troy shall overturn the Grecian state,
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>And sweet revenge her conqu'ring sons shall call,
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>To crush the people that conspir'd her fall.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>Then Caesar from the Julian stock shall rise,
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Whose empire ocean, and whose fame the skies
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Alone shall bound; whom, fraught with eastern spoils,
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Our heav'n, the just reward of human toils,
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Securely shall repay with rites divine;
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>And incense shall ascend before his sacred shrine.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>Then dire debate and impious war shall cease,
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>And the stern age be soften'd into peace:
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Then banish'd Faith shall once again return,
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>And Vestal fires in hallow'd temples burn;
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>And Remus with Quirinus shall sustain
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>The righteous laws, and fraud and force restrain.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Janus himself before his fane shall wait,
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>And keep the dreadful issues of his gate,
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>With bolts and iron bars: within remains
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Imprison'd Fury, bound in brazen chains;
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>High on a trophy rais'd, of useless arms,
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>He sits, and threats the world with vain alarms."
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>He said, and sent Cyllenius with command
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>To free the ports, and ope the Punic land
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>To Trojan guests; lest, ignorant of fate,
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>The queen might force them from her town and state.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Down from the steep of heav'n Cyllenius flies,
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>And cleaves with all his wings the yielding skies.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Soon on the Libyan shore descends the god,
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Performs his message, and displays his rod:
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>The surly murmurs of the people cease;
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>And, as the fates requir'd, they give the peace:
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>The queen herself suspends the rigid laws,
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>The Trojans pities, and protects their cause.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Meantime, in shades of night Aeneas lies:
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Care seiz'd his soul, and sleep forsook his eyes.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>But, when the sun restor'd the cheerful day,
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>He rose, the coast and country to survey,
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Anxious and eager to discover more.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>It look'd a wild uncultivated shore;
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>But, whether humankind, or beasts alone
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>Possess'd the new-found region, was unknown.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Beneath a ledge of rocks his fleet he hides:
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Tall trees surround the mountain's shady sides;
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>The bending brow above a safe retreat provides.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Arm'd with two pointed darts, he leaves his friends,
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>And true Achates on his steps attends.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Lo! in the deep recesses of the wood,
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>Before his eyes his goddess mother stood:
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>A huntress in her habit and her mien;
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Her dress a maid, her air confess'd a queen.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Bare were her knees, and knots her garments bind;
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Loose was her hair, and wanton'd in the wind;
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Her hand sustain'd a bow; her quiver hung behind.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>She seem'd a virgin of the Spartan blood:
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>With such array Harpalyce bestrode
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Her Thracian courser and outstripp'd the rapid flood.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>"Ho, strangers! have you lately seen," she said,
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>"One of my sisters, like myself array'd,
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Who cross'd the lawn, or in the forest stray'd?
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>A painted quiver at her back she bore;
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Varied with spots, a lynx's hide she wore;
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>And at full cry pursued the tusky boar."
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Thus Venus: thus her son replied again:
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>"None of your sisters have we heard or seen,
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>O virgin! or what other name you bear
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Above that style- O more than mortal fair!
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Your voice and mien celestial birth betray!
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>If, as you seem, the sister of the day,
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>Or one at least of chaste Diana's train,
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Let not an humble suppliant sue in vain;
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>But tell a stranger, long in tempests toss'd,
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>What earth we tread, and who commands the coast?
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Then on your name shall wretched mortals call,
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>And offer'd victims at your altars fall."
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>"I dare not," she replied, "assume the name
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Of goddess, or celestial honors claim:
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>For Tyrian virgins bows and quivers bear,
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>And purple buskins o'er their ankles wear.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Know, gentle youth, in Libyan lands you are-
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>A people rude in peace, and rough in war.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>The rising city, which from far you see,
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Is Carthage, and a Tyrian colony.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Phoenician Dido rules the growing state,
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Who fled from Tyre, to shun her brother's hate.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Great were her wrongs, her story full of fate;
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Which I will sum in short. Sichaeus, known
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>For wealth, and brother to the Punic throne,
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Possess'd fair Dido's bed; and either heart
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>At once was wounded with an equal dart.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>Her father gave her, yet a spotless maid;
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>Pygmalion then the Tyrian scepter sway'd:
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>One who condemn'd divine and human laws.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Then strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>The monarch, blinded with desire of wealth,
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>With steel invades his brother's life by stealth;
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Before the sacred altar made him bleed,
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>And long from her conceal'd the cruel deed.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Some tale, some new pretense, he daily coin'd,
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>To soothe his sister, and delude her mind.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>At length, in dead of night, the ghost appears
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Of her unhappy lord: the specter stares,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>And, with erected eyes, his bloody bosom bares.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>The cruel altars and his fate he tells,
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>And the dire secret of his house reveals,
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Then warns the widow, with her household gods,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>To seek a refuge in remote abodes.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>Last, to support her in so long a way,
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>He shows her where his hidden treasure lay.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>Admonish'd thus, and seiz'd with mortal fright,
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>The queen provides companions of her flight:
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>They meet, and all combine to leave the state,
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Who hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>They seize a fleet, which ready rigg'd they find;
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Nor is Pygmalion's treasure left behind.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>The vessels, heavy laden, put to sea
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>With prosp'rous winds; a woman leads the way.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>I know not, if by stress of weather driv'n,
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Or was their fatal course dispos'd by Heav'n;
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>At last they landed, where from far your eyes
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>May view the turrets of new Carthage rise;
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>There bought a space of ground, which (Byrsa call'd,
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>From the bull's hide) they first inclos'd, and wall'd.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>But whence are you? what country claims your birth?
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>What seek you, strangers, on our Libyan earth?"
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>To whom, with sorrow streaming from his eyes,
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>And deeply sighing, thus her son replies:
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>"Could you with patience hear, or I relate,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>O nymph, the tedious annals of our fate!
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Thro' such a train of woes if I should run,
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>The day would sooner than the tale be done!
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>From ancient Troy, by force expell'd, we came-
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>If you by chance have heard the Trojan name.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>On various seas by various tempests toss'd,
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>At length we landed on your Libyan coast.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>The good Aeneas am I call'd- a name,
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>While Fortune favor'd, not unknown to fame.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>My household gods, companions of my woes,
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>With pious care I rescued from our foes.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>To fruitful Italy my course was bent;
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>And from the King of Heav'n is my descent.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>With twice ten sail I cross'd the Phrygian sea;
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Fate and my mother goddess led my way.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Scarce sev'n, the thin remainders of my fleet,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>From storms preserv'd, within your harbor meet.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Myself distress'd, an exile, and unknown,
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Debarr'd from Europe, and from Asia thrown,
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>In Libyan desarts wander thus alone."
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>His tender parent could no longer bear;
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>But, interposing, sought to soothe his care.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>"Whoe'er you are- not unbelov'd by Heav'n,
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Since on our friendly shore your ships are driv'n-
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>Have courage: to the gods permit the rest,
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>And to the queen expose your just request.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Now take this earnest of success, for more:
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Your scatter'd fleet is join'd upon the shore;
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>The winds are chang'd, your friends from danger 
<A NAME="558"></A>free;
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>Or I renounce my skill in augury.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>Twelve swans behold in beauteous order move,
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>And stoop with closing pinions from above;
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Whom late the bird of Jove had driv'n along,
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>And thro' the clouds pursued the scatt'ring throng:
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Now, all united in a goodly team,
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>They skim the ground, and seek the quiet stream.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>As they, with joy returning, clap their wings,
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>And ride the circuit of the skies in rings;
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>Not otherwise your ships, and ev'ry friend,
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Already hold the port, or with swift sails descend.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>No more advice is needful; but pursue
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>The path before you, and the town in view."
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>Thus having said, she turn'd, and made appear
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Her neck refulgent, and dishevel'd hair,
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Which, flowing from her shoulders, reach'd the ground.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>And widely spread ambrosial scents around:
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>In length of train descends her sweeping gown;
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>And, by her graceful walk, the Queen of Love is 
<A NAME="578"></A>known.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>The prince pursued the parting deity
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>With words like these: "Ah! whither do you fly?
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Unkind and cruel! to deceive your son
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>In borrow'd shapes, and his embrace to shun;
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Never to bless my sight, but thus unknown;
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>And still to speak in accents not your own."
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Against the goddess these complaints he made,
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>But took the path, and her commands obey'd.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>They march, obscure; for Venus kindly shrouds
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>With mists their persons, and involves in clouds,
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>That, thus unseen, their passage none might stay,
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>Or force to tell the causes of their way.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>This part perform'd, the goddess flies sublime
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>To visit Paphos and her native clime;
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Where garlands, ever green and ever fair,
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>With vows are offer'd, and with solemn pray'r:
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>A hundred altars in her temple smoke;
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>A thousand bleeding hearts her pow'r invoke.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>They climb the next ascent, and, looking down,
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Now at a nearer distance view the town.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>The prince with wonder sees the stately tow'rs,
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Which late were huts and shepherds' homely bow'rs,
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>The gates and streets; and hears, from ev'ry part,
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>The noise and busy concourse of the mart.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>The toiling Tyrians on each other call
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>To ply their labor: some extend the wall;
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Some build the citadel; the brawny throng
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Or dig, or push unwieldly stones along.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>Some for their dwellings choose a spot of ground,
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>Which, first design'd, with ditches they surround.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Some laws ordain; and some attend the choice
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Of holy senates, and elect by voice.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Here some design a mole, while others there
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Lay deep foundations for a theater;
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>From marble quarries mighty columns hew,
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>For ornaments of scenes, and future view.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>Such is their toil, and such their busy pains,
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>As exercise the bees in flow'ry plains,
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>When winter past, and summer scarce begun,
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Invites them forth to labor in the sun;
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>Some lead their youth abroad, while some condense
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Their liquid store, and some in cells dispense;
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Some at the gate stand ready to receive
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>The golden burthen, and their friends relieve;
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>All with united force, combine to drive
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>The lazy drones from the laborious hive:
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>With envy stung, they view each other's deeds;
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>The fragrant work with diligence proceeds.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>"Thrice happy you, whose walls already rise!"
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>Aeneas said, and view'd, with lifted eyes,
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Their lofty tow'rs; then, entiring at the gate,
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>Conceal'd in clouds (prodigious to relate)
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>He mix'd, unmark'd, among the busy throng,
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>Borne by the tide, and pass'd unseen along.
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Full in the center of the town there stood,
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>Thick set with trees, a venerable wood.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>The Tyrians, landing near this holy ground,
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>And digging here, a prosp'rous omen found:
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>From under earth a courser's head they drew,
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Their growth and future fortune to foreshew.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>This fated sign their foundress Juno gave,
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Of a soil fruitful, and a people brave.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Sidonian Dido here with solemn state
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>Did Juno's temple build, and consecrate,
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Enrich'd with gifts, and with a golden shrine;
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>But more the goddess made the place divine.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>On brazen steps the marble threshold rose,
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>And brazen plates the cedar beams inclose:
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>The rafters are with brazen cov'rings crown'd;
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>The lofty doors on brazen hinges sound.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>What first Aeneas this place beheld,
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Reviv'd his courage, and his fear expell'd.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>For while, expecting there the queen, he rais'd
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>His wond'ring eyes, and round the temple gaz'd,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Admir'd the fortune of the rising town,
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>The striving artists, and their arts' renown;
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>He saw, in order painted on the wall,
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Whatever did unhappy Troy befall:
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>The wars that fame around the world had blown,
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>All to the life, and ev'ry leader known.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>There Agamemnon, Priam here, he spies,
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>And fierce Achilles, who both kings defies.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>He stopp'd, and weeping said: "O friend! ev'n here
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>The monuments of Trojan woes appear!
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>Our known disasters fill ev'n foreign lands:
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>See there, where old unhappy Priam stands!
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Ev'n the mute walls relate the warrior's fame,
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>And Trojan griefs the Tyrians' pity claim."
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>He said (his tears a ready passage find),
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>Devouring what he saw so well design'd,
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>And with an empty picture fed his mind:
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>For there he saw the fainting Grecians yield,
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>And here the trembling Trojans quit the field,
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Pursued by fierce Achilles thro' the plain,
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>On his high chariot driving o'er the slain.
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>The tents of Rhesus next his grief renew,
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>By their white sails betray'd to nightly view;
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>And wakeful Diomede, whose cruel sword
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>The sentries slew, nor spar'd their slumb'ring lord,
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Then took the fiery steeds, ere yet the food
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Of Troy they taste, or drink the Xanthian flood.
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Elsewhere he saw where Troilus defied
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Achilles, and unequal combat tried;
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Then, where the boy disarm'd, with loosen'd reins,
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>Was by his horses hurried o'er the plains,
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Hung by the neck and hair, and dragg'd around:
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>The hostile spear, yet sticking in his wound,
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>With tracks of blood inscrib'd the dusty ground.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>Meantime the Trojan dames, oppress'd with woe,
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>To Pallas' fane in long procession go,
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>In hopes to reconcile their heav'nly foe.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>They weep, they beat their breasts, they rend their 
<A NAME="691"></A>hair,
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>And rich embroider'd vests for presents bear;
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>But the stern goddess stands unmov'd with pray'r.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Thrice round the Trojan walls Achilles drew
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>The corpse of Hector, whom in fight he slew.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Here Priam sues; and there, for sums of gold,
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>The lifeless body of his son is sold.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>So sad an object, and so well express'd,
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>Drew sighs and groans from the griev'd hero's breast,
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>To see the figure of his lifeless friend,
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>And his old sire his helpless hand extend.
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Himself he saw amidst the Grecian train,
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>Mix'd in the bloody battle on the plain;
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>And swarthy Memnon in his arms he knew,
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>His pompous ensigns, and his Indian crew.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>Penthisilea there, with haughty grace,
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Leads to the wars an Amazonian race:
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>In their right hands a pointed dart they wield;
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>The left, for ward, sustains the lunar shield.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>Athwart her breast a golden belt she throws,
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>Amidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes,
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>And dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>Thus while the Trojan prince employs his eyes,
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Fix'd on the walls with wonder and surprise,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>The beauteous Dido, with a num'rous train
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>And pomp of guards, ascends the sacred fane.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>Such on Eurotas' banks, or Cynthus' height,
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Diana seems; and so she charms the sight,
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>When in the dance the graceful goddess leads
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>The choir of nymphs, and overtops their heads:
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>Known by her quiver, and her lofty mien,
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>She walks majestic, and she looks their queen;
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Latona sees her shine above the rest,
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>And feeds with secret joy her silent breast.
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>Such Dido was; with such becoming state,
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Amidst the crowd, she walks serenely great.
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>Their labor to her future sway she speeds,
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>And passing with a gracious glance proceeds;
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>Then mounts the throne, high plac'd before the shrine:
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>In crowds around, the swarming people join.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>She takes petitions, and dispenses laws,
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Hears and determines ev'ry private cause;
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Their tasks in equal portions she divides,
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>And, where unequal, there by lots decides.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Another way by chance Aeneas bends
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>His eyes, and unexpected sees his friends,
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>Antheus, Sergestus grave, Cloanthus strong,
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>And at their backs a mighty Trojan throng,
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>Whom late the tempest on the billows toss'd,
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>And widely scatter'd on another coast.
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>The prince, unseen, surpris'd with wonder stands,
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>And longs, with joyful haste, to join their hands;
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>But, doubtful of the wish'd event, he stays,
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>And from the hollow cloud his friends surveys,
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Impatient till they told their present state,
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>And where they left their ships, and what their 
<A NAME="747"></A>fate,
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>And why they came, and what was their request;
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>For these were sent, commission'd by the rest,
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>To sue for leave to land their sickly men,
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>And gain admission to the gracious queen.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>Ent'ring, with cries they fill'd the holy fane;
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Then thus, with lowly voice, Ilioneus began:
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>"O queen! indulg'd by favor of the gods
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>To found an empire in these new abodes,
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>To build a town, with statutes to restrain
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>The wild inhabitants beneath thy reign,
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>We wretched Trojans, toss'd on ev'ry shore,
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>From sea to sea, thy clemency implore.
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Forbid the fires our shipping to deface!
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Receive th' unhappy fugitives to grace,
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>And spare the remnant of a pious race!
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>We come not with design of wasteful prey,
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>To drive the country, force the swains away:
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>Nor such our strength, nor such is our desire;
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>The vanquish'd dare not to such thoughts aspire.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>A land there is, Hesperia nam'd of old;
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>The soil is fruitful, and the men are bold-
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Th' Oenotrians held it once- by common fame
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>Now call'd Italia, from the leader's name.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>To that sweet region was our voyage bent,
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>When winds and ev'ry warring element
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>Disturb'd our course, and, far from sight of land,
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>Cast our torn vessels on the moving sand:
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>The sea came on; the South, with mighty roar,
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>Dispers'd and dash'd the rest upon the rocky shore.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Those few you see escap'd the Storm, and fear,
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>Unless you interpose, a shipwreck here.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>What men, what monsters, what inhuman race,
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>What laws, what barb'rous customs of the place,
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>Shut up a desart shore to drowning men,
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>And drive us to the cruel seas again?
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>If our hard fortune no compassion draws,
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>Nor hospitable rights, nor human laws,
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>The gods are just, and will revenge our cause.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>Aeneas was our prince: a juster lord,
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>Or nobler warrior, never drew a sword;
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>Observant of the right, religious of his word.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>If yet he lives, and draws this vital air,
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>Nor we, his friends, of safety shall despair;
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>Nor you, great queen, these offices repent,
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>Which he will equal, and perhaps augment.
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>We want not cities, nor Sicilian coasts,
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>Where King Acestes Trojan lineage boasts.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>Permit our ships a shelter on your shores,
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>Refitted from your woods with planks and oars,
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>That, if our prince be safe, we may renew
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>Our destin'd course, and Italy pursue.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>But if, O best of men, the Fates ordain
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>That thou art swallow'd in the Libyan main,
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>And if our young Iulus be no more,
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Dismiss our navy from your friendly shore,
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>That we to good Acestes may return,
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>And with our friends our common losses mourn."
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>Thus spoke Ilioneus: the Trojan crew
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>With cries and clamors his request renew.
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>The modest queen a while, with downcast eyes,
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>Ponder'd the speech; then briefly thus replies:
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>"Trojans, dismiss your fears; my cruel fate,
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>And doubts attending an unsettled state,
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>Force me to guard my coast from foreign foes.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Who has not heard the story of your woes,
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>The name and fortune of your native place,
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>The fame and valor of the Phrygian race?
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>We Tyrians are not so devoid of sense,
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>Nor so remote from Phoebus' influence.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>Whether to Latian shores your course is bent,
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>Or, driv'n by tempests from your first intent,
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>You seek the good Acestes' government,
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>Your men shall be receiv'd, your fleet repair'd,
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>And sail, with ships of convoy for your guard:
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>Or, would you stay, and join your friendly pow'rs
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>To raise and to defend the Tyrian tow'rs,
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>My wealth, my city, and myself are yours.
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>And would to Heav'n, the Storm, you felt, would 
<A NAME="826"></A>bring
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>On Carthaginian coasts your wand'ring king.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>My people shall, by my command, explore
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>The ports and creeks of ev'ry winding shore,
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>And towns, and wilds, and shady woods, in quest
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>Of so renown'd and so desir'd a guest."
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>Rais'd in his mind the Trojan hero stood,
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>And long'd to break from out his ambient cloud:
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>Achates found it, and thus urg'd his way:
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>"From whence, O goddess-born, this long delay?
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>What more can you desire, your welcome sure,
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>Your fleet in safety, and your friends secure?
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>One only wants; and him we saw in vain
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>Oppose the Storm, and swallow'd in the main.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Orontes in his fate our forfeit paid;
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>The rest agrees with what your mother said."
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>Scarce had he spoken, when the cloud gave way,
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>The mists flew upward and dissolv'd in day.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>The Trojan chief appear'd in open sight,
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>August in visage, and serenely bright.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>His mother goddess, with her hands divine,
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>Had form'd his curling locks, and made his temples 
<A NAME="848"></A>shine,
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>And giv'n his rolling eyes a sparkling grace,
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>And breath'd a youthful vigor on his face;
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>Like polish'd ivory, beauteous to behold,
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>Or Parian marble, when enchas'd in gold:
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>Thus radiant from the circling cloud he broke,
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>And thus with manly modesty he spoke:
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>"He whom you seek am I; by tempests toss'd,
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>And sav'd from shipwreck on your Libyan coast;
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>Presenting, gracious queen, before your throne,
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>A prince that owes his life to you alone.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>Fair majesty, the refuge and redress
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>Of those whom fate pursues, and wants oppress,
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>You, who your pious offices employ
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>To save the relics of abandon'd Troy;
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>Receive the shipwreck'd on your friendly shore,
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>With hospitable rites relieve the poor;
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>Associate in your town a wand'ring train,
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>And strangers in your palace entertain:
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>What thanks can wretched fugitives return,
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>Who, scatter'd thro' the world, in exile mourn?
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>The gods, if gods to goodness are inclin'd;
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>If acts of mercy touch their heav'nly mind,
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>And, more than all the gods, your gen'rous heart.
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>Conscious of worth, requite its own desert!
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>In you this age is happy, and this earth,
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>And parents more than mortal gave you birth.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>While rolling rivers into seas shall run,
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>And round the space of heav'n the radiant sun;
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>While trees the mountain tops with shades supply,
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>Your honor, name, and praise shall never die.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>Whate'er abode my fortune has assign'd,
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>Your image shall be present in my mind."
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>Thus having said, he turn'd with pious haste,
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>And joyful his expecting friends embrac'd:
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>With his right hand Ilioneus was grac'd,
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>Serestus with his left; then to his breast
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>Cloanthus and the noble Gyas press'd;
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>And so by turns descended to the rest.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>The Tyrian queen stood fix'd upon his face,
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>Pleas'd with his motions, ravish'd with his grace;
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>Admir'd his fortunes, more admir'd the man;
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>Then recollected stood, and thus began:
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>"What fate, O goddess-born; what angry pow'rs
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>Have cast you shipwrack'd on our barren shores?
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>Are you the great Aeneas, known to fame,
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>Who from celestial seed your lineage claim?
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>The same Aeneas whom fair Venus bore
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>To fam'd Anchises on th' Idaean shore?
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>It calls into my mind, tho' then a child,
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>When Teucer came, from Salamis exil'd,
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>And sought my father's aid, to be restor'd:
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>My father Belus then with fire and sword
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>Invaded Cyprus, made the region bare,
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>And, conqu'ring, finish'd the successful war.
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>From him the Trojan siege I understood,
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>The Grecian chiefs, and your illustrious blood.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>Your foe himself the Dardan valor prais'd,
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>And his own ancestry from Trojans rais'd.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>Enter, my noble guest, and you shall find,
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>If not a costly welcome, yet a kind:
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>For I myself, like you, have been distress'd,
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>Till Heav'n afforded me this place of rest;
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>Like you, an alien in a land unknown,
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>I learn to pity woes so like my own."
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>She said, and to the palace led her guest;
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>Then offer'd incense, and proclaim'd a feast.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>Nor yet less careful for her absent friends,
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>Twice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends;
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>Besides a hundred boars, a hundred lambs,
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>With bleating cries, attend their milky dams;
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>And jars of gen'rous wine and spacious bowls
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>She gives, to cheer the sailors' drooping souls.
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>Now purple hangings clothe the palace walls,
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>And sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls:
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>On Tyrian carpets, richly wrought, they dine;
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>With loads of massy plate the sideboards shine,
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>And antique vases, all of gold emboss'd
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>(The gold itself inferior to the cost),
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>Of curious work, where on the sides were seen
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>The fights and figures of illustrious men,
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>From their first founder to the present queen.
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>The good Aeneas, paternal care
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>Iulus' absence could no longer bear,
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>Dispatch'd Achates to the ships in haste,
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>To give a glad relation of the past,
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>And, fraught with precious gifts, to bring the boy,
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>Snatch'd from the ruins of unhappy Troy:
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>A robe of tissue, stiff with golden wire;
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>An upper vest, once Helen's rich attire,
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>From Argos by the fam'd adultress brought,
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>With golden flow'rs and winding foliage wrought,
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>Her mother Leda's present, when she came
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>To ruin Troy and set the world on flame;
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>The scepter Priam's eldest daughter bore,
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>Her orient necklace, and the crown she wore
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>Of double texture, glorious to behold,
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>One order set with gems, and one with gold.
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>Instructed thus, the wise Achates goes,
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>And in his diligence his duty shows.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>But Venus, anxious for her son's affairs,
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>New counsels tries, and new designs prepares:
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>That Cupid should assume the shape and face
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>Of sweet Ascanius, and the sprightly grace;
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>Should bring the presents, in her nephew's stead,
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>And in Eliza's veins the gentle poison shed:
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>For much she fear'd the Tyrians, double-tongued,
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>And knew the town to Juno's care belong'd.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>These thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke,
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>And thus alarm'd, to winged Love she spoke:
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>"My son, my strength, whose mighty pow'r alone
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>Controls the Thund'rer on his awful throne,
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>To thee thy much-afflicted mother flies,
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>And on thy succor and thy faith relies.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>Thou know'st, my son, how Jove's revengeful wife,
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>By force and fraud, attempts thy brother's life;
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>And often hast thou mourn'd with me his pains.
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>Him Dido now with blandishment detains;
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>But I suspect the town where Juno reigns.
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>For this 't is needful to prevent her art,
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>And fire with love the proud Phoenician's heart:
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>A love so violent, so strong, so sure,
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>As neither age can change, nor art can cure.
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>How this may be perform'd, now take my mind:
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>Ascanius by his father is design'd
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>To come, with presents laden, from the port,
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>To gratify the queen, and gain the court.
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>I mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep,
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>And, ravish'd, in Idalian bow'rs to keep,
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>Or high Cythera, that the sweet deceit
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>May pass unseen, and none prevent the cheat.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>Take thou his form and shape. I beg the grace
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>But only for a night's revolving space:
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>Thyself a boy, assume a boy's dissembled face;
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>That when, amidst the fervor of the feast,
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>The Tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast,
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>And with sweet kisses in her arms constrains,
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>Thou may'st infuse thy venom in her veins."
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>The God of Love obeys, and sets aside
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>His bow and quiver, and his plumy pride;
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>He walks Iulus in his mother's sight,
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>And in the sweet resemblance takes delight.
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>The goddess then to young Ascanius flies,
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>And in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes:
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>Lull'd in her lap, amidst a train of Loves,
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>She gently bears him to her blissful groves,
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>Then with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head,
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>And softly lays him on a flow'ry bed.
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>Cupid meantime assum'd his form and face,
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>Foll'wing Achates with a shorter pace,
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>And brought the gifts. The queen already sate
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>Amidst the Trojan lords, in shining state,
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>High on a golden bed: her princely guest
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>Was next her side; in order sate the rest.
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>Then canisters with bread are heap'd on high;
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>Th' attendants water for their hands supply,
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>And, having wash'd, with silken towels dry.
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>Next fifty handmaids in long order bore
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>The censers, and with fumes the gods adore:
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>Then youths, and virgins twice as many, join
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>To place the dishes, and to serve the wine.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>The Tyrian train, admitted to the feast,
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>Approach, and on the painted couches rest.
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>All on the Trojan gifts with wonder gaze,
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>But view the beauteous boy with more amaze,
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>His rosy-color'd cheeks, his radiant eyes,
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>His motions, voice, and shape, and all the god's 
<A NAME="1015"></A>disguise;
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>Nor pass unprais'd the vest and veil divine,
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>Which wand'ring foliage and rich flow'rs entwine.
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>But, far above the rest, the royal dame,
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>(Already doom'd to love's disastrous flame,)
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>With eyes insatiate, and tumultuous joy,
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>Beholds the presents, and admires the boy.
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>The guileful god about the hero long,
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>With children's play, and false embraces, hung;
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>Then sought the queen: she took him to her arms
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>With greedy pleasure, and devour'd his charms.
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>Unhappy Dido little thought what guest,
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>How dire a god, she drew so near her breast;
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>But he, not mindless of his mother's pray'r,
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>Works in the pliant bosom of the fair,
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>And molds her heart anew, and blots her former care.
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>The dead is to the living love resign'd;
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>And all Aeneas enters in her mind.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>Now, when the rage of hunger was appeas'd,
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>The meat remov'd, and ev'ry guest was pleas'd,
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>The golden bowls with sparkling wine are crown'd,
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>And thro' the palace cheerful cries resound.
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>From gilded roofs depending lamps display
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>Nocturnal beams, that emulate the day.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>A golden bowl, that shone with gems divine,
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>The queen commanded to be crown'd with wine:
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>The bowl that Belus us'd, and all the Tyrian line.
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>Then, silence thro' the hall proclaim'd, she spoke:
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>"O hospitable Jove! we thus invoke,
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>With solemn rites, thy sacred name and pow'r;
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>Bless to both nations this auspicious hour!
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>So may the Trojan and the Tyrian line
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>In lasting concord from this day combine.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>Thou, Bacchus, god of joys and friendly cheer,
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>And gracious Juno, both be present here!
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>And you, my lords of Tyre, your vows address
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>To Heav'n with mine, to ratify the peace."
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>The goblet then she took, with nectar crown'd
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>(Sprinkling the first libations on the ground,)
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>And rais'd it to her mouth with sober grace;
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>Then, sipping, offer'd to the next in place.
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>'T was Bitias whom she call'd, a thirsty soul;
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>He took challenge, and embrac'd the bowl,
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>With pleasure swill'd the gold, nor ceas'd to draw,
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw.
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>The goblet goes around: Iopas brought
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>His golden lyre, and sung what ancient Atlas taught:
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>The various labors of the wand'ring moon,
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>And whence proceed th' eclipses of the sun;
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>Th' original of men and beasts; and whence
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>The rains arise, and fires their warmth dispense,
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>And fix'd and erring stars dispose their influence;
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>What shakes the solid earth; what cause delays
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>The summer nights and shortens winter days.
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>With peals of shouts the Tyrians praise the song:
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>Those peals are echo'd by the Trojan throng.
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>Th' unhappy queen with talk prolong'd the night,
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>And drank large draughts of love with vast delight;
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>Of Priam much enquir'd, of Hector more;
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>Then ask'd what arms the swarthy Memnon wore,
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>What troops he landed on the Trojan shore;
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>The steeds of Diomede varied the discourse,
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>And fierce Achilles, with his matchless force;
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>At length, as fate and her ill stars requir'd,
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>To hear the series of the war desir'd.
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>"Relate at large, my godlike guest," she said,
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>"The Grecian stratagems, the town betray'd:
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>The fatal issue of so long a war,
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>Your flight, your wand'rings, and your woes, declare;
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>For, since on ev'ry sea, on ev'ry coast,
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>Your men have been distress'd, your navy toss'd,
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>Sev'n times the sun has either tropic view'd,
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>The winter banish'd, and the spring renew'd."
