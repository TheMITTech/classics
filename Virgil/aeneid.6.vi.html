<A NAME="10"></A>He said, and wept; then spread his sails before
<A NAME="11"></A><BR>The winds, and reach'd at length the Cumaean shore:
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>Their anchors dropp'd, his crew the vessels moor.
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>They turn their heads to sea, their sterns to land,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>And greet with greedy joy th' Italian strand.
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Some strike from clashing flints their fiery seed;
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Some gather sticks, the kindled flames to feed,
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Or search for hollow trees, and fell the woods,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Or trace thro' valleys the discover'd floods.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Thus, while their sev'ral charges they fulfil,
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>The pious prince ascends the sacred hill
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Where Phoebus is ador'd; and seeks the shade
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Which hides from sight his venerable maid.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Deep in a cave the Sibyl makes abode;
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Thence full of fate returns, and of the god.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Thro' Trivia's grove they walk; and now behold,
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>And enter now, the temple roof'd with gold.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>When Daedalus, to fly the Cretan shore,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>His heavy limbs on jointed pinions bore,
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>(The first who sail'd in air,) 't is sung by Fame,
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>To the Cumaean coast at length he came,
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>And here alighting, built this costly frame.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Inscrib'd to Phoebus, here he hung on high
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>The steerage of his wings, that cut the sky:
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Then o'er the lofty gate his art emboss'd
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Androgeos' death, and off'rings to his ghost;
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>Sev'n youths from Athens yearly sent, to meet
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>The fate appointed by revengeful Crete.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>And next to those the dreadful urn was plac'd,
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>In which the destin'd names by lots were cast:
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>The mournful parents stand around in tears,
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>And rising Crete against their shore appears.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>There too, in living sculpture, might be seen
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>The mad affection of the Cretan queen;
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Then how she cheats her bellowing lover's eye;
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>The rushing leap, the doubtful progeny,
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>The lower part a beast, a man above,
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>The monument of their polluted love.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Not far from thence he grav'd the wondrous maze,
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>A thousand doors, a thousand winding ways:
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Here dwells the monster, hid from human view,
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Not to be found, but by the faithful clew;
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>Till the kind artist, mov'd with pious grief,
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Lent to the loving maid this last relief,
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>And all those erring paths describ'd so well
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>That Theseus conquer'd and the monster fell.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Here hapless Icarus had found his part,
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>Had not the father's grief restrain'd his art.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>He twice assay'd to cast his son in gold;
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>Twice from his hands he dropp'd the forming mold.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>All this with wond'ring eyes Aeneas view'd;
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>Each varying object his delight renew'd:
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Eager to read the rest- Achates came,
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>And by his side the mad divining dame,
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>The priestess of the god, Deiphobe her name.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>"Time suffers not," she said, "to feed your eyes
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>With empty pleasures; haste the sacrifice.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Sev'n bullocks, yet unyok'd, for Phoebus choose,
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>And for Diana sev'n unspotted ewes."
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>This said, the servants urge the sacred rites,
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>While to the temple she the prince invites.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>A spacious cave, within its farmost part,
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>Was hew'd and fashion'd by laborious art
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Thro' the hill's hollow sides: before the place,
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>A hundred doors a hundred entries grace;
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>As many voices issue, and the sound
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Of Sybil's words as many times rebound.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Now to the mouth they come. Aloud she cries:
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>"This is the time; enquire your destinies.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>He comes; behold the god!" Thus while she said,
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>(And shiv'ring at the sacred entry stay'd,)
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Her color chang'd; her face was not the same,
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>And hollow groans from her deep spirit came.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Her hair stood up; convulsive rage possess'd
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Her trembling limbs, and heav'd her lab'ring breast.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Greater than humankind she seem'd to look,
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>And with an accent more than mortal spoke.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll;
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>When all the god came rushing on her soul.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Swiftly she turn'd, and, foaming as she spoke:
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>"Why this delay?" she cried- "the pow'rs invoke!
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Thy pray'rs alone can open this abode;
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Else vain are my demands, and dumb the god."
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>She said no more. The trembling Trojans hear,
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>O'erspread with a damp sweat and holy fear.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>The prince himself, with awful dread possess'd,
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>His vows to great Apollo thus address'd:
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>"Indulgent god, propitious pow'r to Troy,
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Swift to relieve, unwilling to destroy,
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>Directed by whose hand the Dardan dart
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Pierc'd the proud Grecian's only mortal part:
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Thus far, by fate's decrees and thy commands,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Thro' ambient seas and thro' devouring sands,
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Our exil'd crew has sought th' Ausonian ground;
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>And now, at length, the flying coast is found.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Thus far the fate of Troy, from place to place,
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>With fury has pursued her wand'ring race.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Here cease, ye pow'rs, and let your vengeance end:
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Troy is no more, and can no more offend.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>And thou, O sacred maid, inspir'd to see
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>Th' event of things in dark futurity;
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Give me what Heav'n has promis'd to my fate,
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>To conquer and command the Latian state;
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>To fix my wand'ring gods, and find a place
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>For the long exiles of the Trojan race.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>Then shall my grateful hands a temple rear
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>To the twin gods, with vows and solemn pray'r;
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>And annual rites, and festivals, and games,
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Shall be perform'd to their auspicious names.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Nor shalt thou want thy honors in my land;
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>For there thy faithful oracles shall stand,
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Preserv'd in shrines; and ev'ry sacred lay,
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Which, by thy mouth, Apollo shall convey:
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>All shall be treasur'd by a chosen train
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Of holy priests, and ever shall remain.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>But O! commit not thy prophetic mind
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>To flitting leaves, the sport of ev'ry wind,
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Lest they disperse in air our empty fate;
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Write not, but, what the pow'rs ordain, relate."
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Struggling in vain, impatient of her load,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>And lab'ring underneath the pond'rous god,
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>The more she strove to shake him from her breast,
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>With more and far superior force he press'd;
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>Commands his entrance, and, without control,
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Usurps her organs and inspires her soul.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Now, with a furious blast, the hundred doors
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Ope of themselves; a rushing whirlwind roars
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Within the cave, and Sibyl's voice restores:
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>"Escap'd the dangers of the wat'ry reign,
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>Yet more and greater ills by land remain.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>The coast, so long desir'd (nor doubt th' event),
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Thy troops shall reach, but, having reach'd, repent.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Wars, horrid wars, I view- a field of blood,
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>And Tiber rolling with a purple flood.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Simois nor Xanthus shall be wanting there:
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>A new Achilles shall in arms appear,
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>And he, too, goddess-born. Fierce Juno's hate,
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Added to hostile force, shall urge thy fate.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>To what strange nations shalt not thou resort,
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Driv'n to solicit aid at ev'ry court!
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>The cause the same which Ilium once oppress'd;
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>A foreign mistress, and a foreign guest.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>But thou, secure of soul, unbent with woes,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>The more thy fortune frowns, the more oppose.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>The dawnings of thy safety shall be shown
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>From whence thou least shalt hope, a Grecian town."
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Thus, from the dark recess, the Sibyl spoke,
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>And the resisting air the thunder broke;
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>The cave rebellow'd, and the temple shook.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Th' ambiguous god, who rul'd her lab'ring breast,
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>In these mysterious words his mind express'd;
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Some truths reveal'd, in terms involv'd the rest.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>At length her fury fell, her foaming ceas'd,
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>And, ebbing in her soul, the god decreas'd.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Then thus the chief: "No terror to my view,
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>No frightful face of danger can be new.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Inur'd to suffer, and resolv'd to dare,
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>The Fates, without my pow'r, shall be without my 
<A NAME="168"></A>care.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>This let me crave, since near your grove the road
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>To hell lies open, and the dark abode
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Which Acheron surrounds, th' innavigable flood;
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Conduct me thro' the regions void of light,
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>And lead me longing to my father's sight.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>For him, a thousand dangers I have sought,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>And, rushing where the thickest Grecians fought,
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Safe on my back the sacred burthen brought.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>He, for my sake, the raging ocean tried,
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>And wrath of Heav'n, my still auspicious guide,
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>And bore beyond the strength decrepid age supplied.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Oft, since he breath'd his last, in dead of night
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>His reverend image stood before my sight;
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Enjoin'd to seek, below, his holy shade;
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Conducted there by your unerring aid.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>But you, if pious minds by pray'rs are won,
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Oblige the father, and protect the son.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>Yours is the pow'r; nor Proserpine in vain
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Has made you priestess of her nightly reign.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>If Orpheus, arm'd with his enchanting lyre,
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>The ruthless king with pity could inspire,
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>And from the shades below redeem his wife;
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>If Pollux, off'ring his alternate life,
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Could free his brother, and can daily go
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>By turns aloft, by turns descend below-
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Why name I Theseus, or his greater friend,
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Who trod the downward path, and upward could ascend?
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Not less than theirs from Jove my lineage came;
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>My mother greater, my descent the same."
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>So pray'd the Trojan prince, and, while he pray'd,
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>His hand upon the holy altar laid.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Then thus replied the prophetess divine:
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>"O goddess-born of great Anchises' line,
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>The gates of hell are open night and day;
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Smooth the descent, and easy is the way:
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>But to return, and view the cheerful skies,
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>In this the task and mighty labor lies.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>To few great Jupiter imparts this grace,
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>And those of shining worth and heav'nly race.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Betwixt those regions and our upper light,
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Deep forests and impenetrable night
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Possess the middle space: th' infernal bounds
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Cocytus, with his sable waves, surrounds.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>But if so dire a love your soul invades,
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>As twice below to view the trembling shades;
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>If you so hard a toil will undertake,
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>As twice to pass th' innavigable lake;
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Receive my counsel. In the neighb'ring grove
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>There stands a tree; the queen of Stygian Jove
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Claims it her own; thick woods and gloomy night
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Conceal the happy plant from human sight.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>One bough it bears; but (wondrous to behold!)
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>The ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold:
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>This from the vulgar branches must be torn,
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>And to fair Proserpine the present borne,
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>Ere leave be giv'n to tempt the nether skies.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>The first thus rent a second will arise,
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>And the same metal the same room supplies.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Look round the wood, with lifted eyes, to see
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>The lurking gold upon the fatal tree:
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Then rend it off, as holy rites command;
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>The willing metal will obey thy hand,
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Following with ease, if favor'd by thy fate,
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>Thou art foredoom'd to view the Stygian state:
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>If not, no labor can the tree constrain;
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>And strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Besides, you know not, while you here attend,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Th' unworthy fate of your unhappy friend:
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Breathless he lies; and his unburied ghost,
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Depriv'd of fun'ral rites, pollutes your host.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Pay first his pious dues; and, for the dead,
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Two sable sheep around his hearse be led;
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Then, living turfs upon his body lay:
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>This done, securely take the destin'd way,
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>To find the regions destitute of day."
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>She said, and held her peace. Aeneas went
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Sad from the cave, and full of discontent,
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Achates, the companion of his breast,
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Goes grieving by his side, with equal cares oppress'd.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Walking, they talk'd, and fruitlessly divin'd
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>What friend the priestess by those words design'd.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>But soon they found an object to deplore:
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Misenus lay extended the shore;
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Son of the God of Winds: none so renown'd
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>The warrior trumpet in the field to sound;
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms,
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>And rouse to dare their fate in honorable arms.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>He serv'd great Hector, and was ever near,
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Not with his trumpet only, but his spear.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>But by Pelides' arms when Hector fell,
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>He chose Aeneas; and he chose as well.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Swoln with applause, and aiming still at more,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>He now provokes the sea gods from the shore;
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>With envy Triton heard the martial sound,
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>And the bold champion, for his challenge, drown'd;
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Then cast his mangled carcass on the strand:
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>The gazing crowd around the body stand.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>All weep; but most Aeneas mourns his fate,
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>And hastens to perform the funeral state.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>In altar-wise, a stately pile they rear;
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>The basis broad below, and top advanc'd in air.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>An ancient wood, fit for the work design'd,
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>(The shady covert of the salvage kind,)
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>The Trojans found: the sounding ax is plied;
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Firs, pines, and pitch trees, and the tow'ring pride
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Of forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke,
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Huge trunks of trees, fell'd from the steepy crown
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>Of the bare mountains, roll with ruin down.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>Arm'd like the rest the Trojan prince appears,
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>And by his pious labor urges theirs.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Thus while he wrought, revolving in his mind
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>The ways to compass what his wish design'd,
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>He cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove,
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>And then with vows implor'd the Queen of Love:
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>"O may thy pow'r, propitious still to me,
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Conduct my steps to find the fatal tree,
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>In this deep forest; since the Sibyl's breath
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Foretold, alas! too true, Misenus' death."
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Scarce had he said, when, full before his sight,
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Two doves, descending from their airy flight,
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Secure upon the grassy plain alight.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>He knew his mother's birds; and thus he pray'd:
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>"Be you my guides, with your auspicious aid,
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>And lead my footsteps, till the branch be found,
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Whose glitt'ring shadow gilds the sacred ground.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>And thou, great parent, with celestial care,
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>In this distress be present to my pray'r!"
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Thus having said, he stopp'd with watchful sight,
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Observing still the motions of their flight,
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>What course they took, what happy signs they shew.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>They fed, and, flutt'ring, by degrees withdrew
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Still farther from the place, but still in view:
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Hopping and flying, thus they led him on
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>To the slow lake, whose baleful stench to shun
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>They wing'd their flight aloft; then, stooping low,
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>Perch'd on the double tree that bears the golden 
<A NAME="307"></A>bough.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>Thro' the green leafs the glitt'ring shadows glow;
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>As, on the sacred oak, the wintry mistletoe,
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Where the proud mother views her precious brood,
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>And happier branches, which she never sow'd.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Such was the glitt'ring; such the ruddy rind,
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>And dancing leaves, that wanton'd in the wind.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>He seiz'd the shining bough with griping hold,
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>And rent away, with ease, the ling'ring gold;
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Then to the Sibyl's palace bore the prize.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Meantime the Trojan troops, with weeping eyes,
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>To dead Misenus pay his obsequies.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>First, from the ground a lofty pile they rear,
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Of pitch trees, oaks, and pines, and unctuous fir:
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>The fabric's front with cypress twigs they strew,
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>And stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>The topmost part his glitt'ring arms adorn;
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>Warm waters, then, in brazen caldrons borne,
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Are pour'd to wash his body, joint by joint,
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>And fragrant oils the stiffen'd limbs anoint.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>With groans and cries Misenus they deplore:
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Then on a bier, with purple cover'd o'er,
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>The breathless body, thus bewail'd, they lay,
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>And fire the pile, their faces turn'd away-
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Such reverend rites their fathers us'd to pay.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Pure oil and incense on the fire they throw,
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>And fat of victims, which his friends bestow.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>These gifts the greedy flames to dust devour;
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Then on the living coals red wine they pour;
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>And, last, the relics by themselves dispose,
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Which in a brazen urn the priests inclose.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Old Corynaeus compass'd thrice the crew,
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>And dipp'd an olive branch in holy dew;
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Which thrice he sprinkled round, and thrice aloud
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Invok'd the dead, and then dismissed the crowd.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>But good Aeneas order'd on the shore
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>A stately tomb, whose top a trumpet bore,
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>A soldier's fauchion, and a seaman's oar.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>Thus was his friend interr'd; and deathless fame
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>Still to the lofty cape consigns his name.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>These rites perform'd, the prince, without delay,
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Hastes to the nether world his destin'd way.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Deep was the cave; and, downward as it went
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>From the wide mouth, a rocky rough descent;
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>And here th' access a gloomy grove defends,
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>And there th' unnavigable lake extends,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>O'er whose unhappy waters, void of light,
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>No bird presumes to steer his airy flight;
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Such deadly stenches from the depths arise,
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>And steaming sulphur, that infects the skies.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>From hence the Grecian bards their legends make,
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>And give the name Avernus to the lake.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Four sable bullocks, in the yoke untaught,
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>For sacrifice the pious hero brought.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>The priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns;
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Then cuts the curling hair; that first oblation 
<A NAME="363"></A>burns,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Invoking Hecate hither to repair:
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>A pow'rful name in hell and upper air.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>The sacred priests with ready knives bereave
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>The beasts of life, and in full bowls receive
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>The streaming blood: a lamb to Hell and Night
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>(The sable wool without a streak of white)
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Aeneas offers; and, by fate's decree,
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>A barren heifer, Proserpine, to thee,
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>With holocausts he Pluto's altar fills;
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Sev'n brawny bulls with his own hand he kills;
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Then on the broiling entrails oil he pours;
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>Which, ointed thus, the raging flame devours.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Late the nocturnal sacrifice begun,
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Nor ended till the next returning sun.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Then earth began to bellow, trees to dance,
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>And howling dogs in glimm'ring light advance,
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Ere Hecate came. "Far hence be souls profane!"
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>The Sibyl cried, "and from the grove abstain!
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Now, Trojan, take the way thy fates afford;
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Assume thy courage, and unsheathe thy sword."
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>She said, and pass'd along the gloomy space;
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>The prince pursued her steps with equal pace.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Ye realms, yet unreveal'd to human sight,
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Ye gods who rule the regions of the night,
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Ye gliding ghosts, permit me to relate
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>The mystic wonders of your silent state!
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Obscure they went thro' dreary shades, that led
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>Along the waste dominions of the dead.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Thus wander travelers in woods by night,
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>By the moon's doubtful and malignant light,
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>When Jove in dusky clouds involves the skies,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>And the faint crescent shoots by fits before their 
<A NAME="396"></A>eyes.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Just in the gate and in the jaws of hell,
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Revengeful Cares and sullen Sorrows dwell,
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>And pale Diseases, and repining Age,
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Want, Fear, and Famine's unresisted rage;
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Here Toils, and Death, and Death's half-brother, 
<A NAME="402"></A>Sleep,
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Forms terrible to view, their sentry keep;
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>With anxious Pleasures of a guilty mind,
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>Deep Frauds before, and open Force behind;
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>The Furies' iron beds; and Strife, that shakes
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Her hissing tresses and unfolds her snakes.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Full in the midst of this infernal road,
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>An elm displays her dusky arms abroad:
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>The God of Sleep there hides his heavy head,
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>And empty dreams on ev'ry leaf are spread.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Of various forms unnumber'd specters more,
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Centaurs, and double shapes, besiege the door.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Before the passage, horrid Hydra stands,
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>And Briareus with all his hundred hands;
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>Gorgons, Geryon with his triple frame;
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>And vain Chimaera vomits empty flame.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>The chief unsheath'd his shining steel, prepar'd,
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Tho' seiz'd with sudden fear, to force the guard,
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Off'ring his brandish'd weapon at their face;
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Had not the Sibyl stopp'd his eager pace,
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>And told him what those empty phantoms were:
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Forms without bodies, and impassive air.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Hence to deep Acheron they take their way,
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Whose troubled eddies, thick with ooze and clay,
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Are whirl'd aloft, and in Cocytus lost.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>There Charon stands, who rules the dreary coast-
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>A sordid god: down from his hoary chin
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>A length of beard descends, uncomb'd, unclean;
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>His eyes, like hollow furnaces on fire;
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>He spreads his canvas; with his pole he steers;
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>The freights of flitting ghosts in his thin bottom 
<A NAME="434"></A>bears.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>He look'd in years; yet in his years were seen
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>A youthful vigor and autumnal green.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>An airy crowd came rushing where he stood,
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Which fill'd the margin of the fatal flood:
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Husbands and wives, boys and unmarried maids,
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>And mighty heroes' more majestic shades,
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>And youths, intomb'd before their fathers' eyes,
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>With hollow groans, and shrieks, and feeble cries.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Thick as the leaves in autumn strow the woods,
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Or fowls, by winter forc'd, forsake the floods,
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>And wing their hasty flight to happier lands;
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Such, and so thick, the shiv'ring army stands,
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>And press for passage with extended hands.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Now these, now those, the surly boatman bore:
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>The rest he drove to distance from the shore.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>The hero, who beheld with wond'ring eyes
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>The tumult mix'd with shrieks, laments, and cries,
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Ask'd of his guide, what the rude concourse meant;
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Why to the shore the thronging people bent;
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>What forms of law among the ghosts were us'd;
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>Why some were ferried o'er, and some refus'd.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>"Son of Anchises, offspring of the gods,"
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>The Sibyl said, "you see the Stygian floods,
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>The sacred stream which heav'n's imperial state
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Attests in oaths, and fears to violate.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>The ghosts rejected are th' unhappy crew
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Depriv'd of sepulchers and fun'ral due:
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>The boatman, Charon; those, the buried host,
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>He ferries over to the farther coast;
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Nor dares his transport vessel cross the waves
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>With such whose bones are not compos'd in graves.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>A hundred years they wander on the shore;
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>At length, their penance done, are wafted o'er."
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>The Trojan chief his forward pace repress'd,
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Revolving anxious thoughts within his breast,
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>He saw his friends, who, whelm'd beneath the waves,
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Their fun'ral honors claim'd, and ask'd their quiet 
<A NAME="472"></A>graves.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>The lost Leucaspis in the crowd he knew,
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>And the brave leader of the Lycian crew,
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Whom, on the Tyrrhene seas, the tempests met;
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>The sailors master'd, and the ship o'erset.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Amidst the spirits, Palinurus press'd,
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>Yet fresh from life, a new-admitted guest,
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Who, while he steering view'd the stars, and bore
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>His course from Afric to the Latian shore,
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Fell headlong down. The Trojan fix'd his view,
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>And scarcely thro' the gloom the sullen shadow knew.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Then thus the prince: "What envious pow'r, O friend,
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Brought your lov'd life to this disastrous end?
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>For Phoebus, ever true in all he said,
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Has in your fate alone my faith betray'd.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>The god foretold you should not die, before
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>You reach'd, secure from seas, th' Italian shore.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Is this th' unerring pow'r?" The ghost replied;
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>"Nor Phoebus flatter'd, nor his answers lied;
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>Nor envious gods have sent me to the deep:
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>But, while the stars and course of heav'n I keep,
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>My wearied eyes were seiz'd with fatal sleep.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>I fell; and, with my weight, the helm constrain'd
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>Was drawn along, which yet my gripe retain'd.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Now by the winds and raging waves I swear,
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Your safety, more than mine, was then my care;
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Lest, of the guide bereft, the rudder lost,
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Your ship should run against the rocky coast.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Three blust'ring nights, borne by the southern blast,
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>I floated, and discover'd land at last:
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>High on a mounting wave my head I bore,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>Forcing my strength, and gath'ring to the shore.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>Panting, but past the danger, now I seiz'd
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>The craggy cliffs, and my tir'd members eas'd.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>While, cumber'd with my dropping clothes, I lay,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>The cruel nation, covetous of prey,
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>Stain'd with my blood th' unhospitable coast;
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>And now, by winds and waves, my lifeless limbs are 
<A NAME="510"></A>toss'd:
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>Which O avert, by yon ethereal light,
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Which I have lost for this eternal night!
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Or, if by dearer ties you may be won,
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>By your dead sire, and by your living son,
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Redeem from this reproach my wand'ring ghost;
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Or with your navy seek the Velin coast,
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>And in a peaceful grave my corpse compose;
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Or, if a nearer way your mother shows,
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Without whose aid you durst not undertake
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>This frightful passage o'er the Stygian lake,
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Lend to this wretch your hand, and waft him o'er
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>To the sweet banks of yon forbidden shore."
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Scarce had he said, the prophetess began:
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>"What hopes delude thee, miserable man?
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Think'st thou, thus unintomb'd, to cross the floods,
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>To view the Furies and infernal gods,
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>And visit, without leave, the dark abodes?
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Attend the term of long revolving years;
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>Fate, and the dooming gods, are deaf to tears.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>This comfort of thy dire misfortune take:
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>The wrath of Heav'n, inflicted for thy sake,
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>With vengeance shall pursue th' inhuman coast,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Till they propitiate thy offended ghost,
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>And raise a tomb, with vows and solemn pray'r;
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>And Palinurus' name the place shall bear."
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>This calm'd his cares; sooth'd with his future fame,
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>And pleas'd to hear his propagated name.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Now nearer to the Stygian lake they draw:
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Whom, from the shore, the surly boatman saw;
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Observ'd their passage thro' the shady wood,
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>And mark'd their near approaches to the flood.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Then thus he call'd aloud, inflam'd with wrath:
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>"Mortal, whate'er, who this forbidden path
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>In arms presum'st to tread, I charge thee, stand,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>And tell thy name, and bus'ness in the land.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Know this, the realm of night- the Stygian shore:
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>My boat conveys no living bodies o'er;
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Nor was I pleas'd great Theseus once to bear,
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Who forc'd a passage with his pointed spear,
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>Nor strong Alcides- men of mighty fame,
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>And from th' immortal gods their lineage came.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>In fetters one the barking porter tied,
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>And took him trembling from his sov'reign's side:
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Two sought by force to seize his beauteous bride."
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>To whom the Sibyl thus: "Compose thy mind;
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Nor frauds are here contriv'd, nor force design'd.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Still may the dog the wand'ring troops constrain
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>Of airy ghosts, and vex the guilty train,
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>And with her grisly lord his lovely queen remain.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>The Trojan chief, whose lineage is from Jove,
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Much fam'd for arms, and more for filial love,
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Is sent to seek his sire in your Elysian grove.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>If neither piety, nor Heav'n's command,
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Can gain his passage to the Stygian strand,
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>This fatal present shall prevail at least."
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Then shew'd the shining bough, conceal'd within her 
<A NAME="567"></A>vest.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>No more was needful: for the gloomy god
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Stood mute with awe, to see the golden rod;
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Admir'd the destin'd off'ring to his queen-
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>A venerable gift, so rarely seen.
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>His fury thus appeas'd, he puts to land;
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>The ghosts forsake their seats at his command:
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>He clears the deck, receives the mighty freight;
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>The leaky vessel groans beneath the weight.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Slowly she sails, and scarcely stems the tides;
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>The pressing water pours within her sides.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>His passengers at length are wafted o'er,
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Expos'd, in muddy weeds, upon the miry shore.
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>No sooner landed, in his den they found
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>The triple porter of the Stygian sound,
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Grim Cerberus, who soon began to rear
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>His crested snakes, and arm'd his bristling hair.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>The prudent Sibyl had before prepar'd
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>A sop, in honey steep'd, to charm the guard;
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Which, mix'd with pow'rful drugs, she cast before
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>His greedy grinning jaws, just op'd to roar.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>With three enormous mouths he gapes; and straight,
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>With hunger press'd, devours the pleasing bait.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>Long draughts of sleep his monstrous limbs enslave;
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>He reels, and, falling, fills the spacious cave.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>The keeper charm'd, the chief without delay
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Pass'd on, and took th' irremeable way.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Before the gates, the cries of babes new born,
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Whom fate had from their tender mothers torn,
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Assault his ears: then those, whom form of laws
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Condemn'd to die, when traitors judg'd their cause.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Nor want they lots, nor judges to review
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>The wrongful sentence, and award a new.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Minos, the strict inquisitor, appears;
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>And lives and crimes, with his assessors, hears.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Round in his urn the blended balls he rolls,
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>Absolves the just, and dooms the guilty souls.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>The next, in place and punishment, are they
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Who prodigally throw their souls away;
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Fools, who, repining at their wretched state,
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>And loathing anxious life, suborn'd their fate.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>With late repentance now they would retrieve
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>The bodies they forsook, and wish to live;
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Their pains and poverty desire to bear,
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>To view the light of heav'n, and breathe the vital 
<A NAME="612"></A>air:
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>But fate forbids; the Stygian floods oppose,
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>And with circling streams the captive souls inclose.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>Not far from thence, the Mournful Fields appear
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>So call'd from lovers that inhabit there.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>The souls whom that unhappy flame invades,
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>In secret solitude and myrtle shades
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>Make endless moans, and, pining with desire,
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Lament too late their unextinguish'd fire.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Here Procris, Eriphyle here he found,
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Baring her breast, yet bleeding with the wound
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>Made by her son. He saw Pasiphae there,
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>With Phaedra's ghost, a foul incestuous pair.
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>There Laodamia, with Evadne, moves,
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>Unhappy both, but loyal in their loves:
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Caeneus, a woman once, and once a man,
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>But ending in the sex she first began.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Not far from these Phoenician Dido stood,
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>Fresh from her wound, her bosom bath'd in blood;
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Whom when the Trojan hero hardly knew,
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>Obscure in shades, and with a doubtful view,
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>(Doubtful as he who sees, thro' dusky night,
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>Or thinks he sees, the moon's uncertain light,)
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>With tears he first approach'd the sullen shade;
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>And, as his love inspir'd him, thus he said:
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>"Unhappy queen! then is the common breath
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Of rumor true, in your reported death,
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>And I, alas! the cause? By Heav'n, I vow,
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>And all the pow'rs that rule the realms below,
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Unwilling I forsook your friendly state,
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>Commanded by the gods, and forc'd by fate-
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Those gods, that fate, whose unresisted might
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Have sent me to these regions void of light,
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>Thro' the vast empire of eternal night.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Nor dar'd I to presume, that, press'd with grief,
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>My flight should urge you to this dire relief.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Stay, stay your steps, and listen to my vows:
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>'T is the last interview that fate allows!"
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>In vain he thus attempts her mind to move
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>With tears, and pray'rs, and late-repenting love.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Disdainfully she look'd; then turning round,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>But fix'd her eyes unmov'd upon the ground,
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>And what he says and swears, regards no more
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>Than the deaf rocks, when the loud billows roar;
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>But whirl'd away, to shun his hateful sight,
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>Hid in the forest and the shades of night;
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Then sought Sichaeus thro' the shady grove,
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Who answer'd all her cares, and equal'd all her 
<A NAME="660"></A>love.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>Some pious tears the pitying hero paid,
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>And follow'd with his eyes the flitting shade,
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>Then took the forward way, by fate ordain'd,
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>And, with his guide, the farther fields attain'd,
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Where, sever'd from the rest, the warrior souls 
<A NAME="666"></A>remain'd.
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Tydeus he met, with Meleager's race,
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>The pride of armies, and the soldiers' grace;
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>And pale Adrastus with his ghastly face.
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Of Trojan chiefs he view'd a num'rous train,
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>All much lamented, all in battle slain;
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Glaucus and Medon, high above the rest,
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Antenor's sons, and Ceres' sacred priest.
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>And proud Idaeus, Priam's charioteer,
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Who shakes his empty reins, and aims his airy spear.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>The gladsome ghosts, in circling troops, attend
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>And with unwearied eyes behold their friend;
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Delight to hover near, and long to know
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>What bus'ness brought him to the realms below.
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>But Argive chiefs, and Agamemnon's train,
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>When his refulgent arms flash'd thro' the shady 
<A NAME="682"></A>plain,
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>Fled from his well-known face, with wonted fear,
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>As when his thund'ring sword and pointed spear
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>Drove headlong to their ships, and glean'd the routed 
<A NAME="686"></A>rear.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>They rais'd a feeble cry, with trembling notes;
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>But the weak voice deceiv'd their gasping throats.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>Here Priam's son, Deiphobus, he found,
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>Whose face and limbs were one continued wound:
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Dishonest, with lopp'd arms, the youth appears,
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>Spoil'd of his nose, and shorten'd of his ears.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>He scarcely knew him, striving to disown
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>His blotted form, and blushing to be known;
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>And therefore first began: "O Tsucer's race,
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Who durst thy faultless figure thus deface?
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>What heart could wish, what hand inflict, this dire 
<A NAME="698"></A>disgrace?
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>'Twas fam'd, that in our last and fatal night
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>Your single prowess long sustain'd the fight,
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>Till tir'd, not forc'd, a glorious fate you chose,
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>And fell upon a heap of slaughter'd foes.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>But, in remembrance of so brave a deed,
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>A tomb and fun'ral honors I decreed;
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Thrice call'd your manes on the Trojan plains:
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>The place your armor and your name retains.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Your body too I sought, and, had I found,
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Design'd for burial in your native ground."
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>The ghost replied: "Your piety has paid
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>All needful rites, to rest my wand'ring shade;
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>But cruel fate, and my more cruel wife,
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>To Grecian swords betray'd my sleeping life.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>These are the monuments of Helen's love:
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>The shame I bear below, the marks I bore above.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>You know in what deluding joys we pass'd
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>The night that was by Heav'n decreed our last:
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>For, when the fatal horse, descending down,
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Pregnant with arms, o'erwhelm'd th' unhappy town
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>She feign'd nocturnal orgies; left my bed,
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>And, mix'd with Trojan dames, the dances led
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>Then, waving high her torch, the signal made,
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Which rous'd the Grecians from their ambuscade.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>With watching overworn, with cares oppress'd,
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>Unhappy I had laid me down to rest,
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>And heavy sleep my weary limbs possess'd.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Meantime my worthy wife our arms mislaid,
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>And from beneath my head my sword convey'd;
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>The door unlatch'd, and, with repeated calls,
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>Invites her former lord within my walls.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Thus in her crime her confidence she plac'd,
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>And with new treasons would redeem the past.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>What need I more? Into the room they ran,
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>And meanly murther'd a defenseless man.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>Ulysses, basely born, first led the way.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Avenging pow'rs! with justice if I pray,
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>That fortune be their own another day!
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>But answer you; and in your turn relate,
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>What brought you, living, to the Stygian state:
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>Driv'n by the winds and errors of the sea,
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>Or did you Heav'n's superior doom obey?
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>Or tell what other chance conducts your way,
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>To view with mortal eyes our dark retreats,
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>Tumults and torments of th' infernal seats."
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>While thus in talk the flying hours they pass,
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>The sun had finish'd more than half his race:
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>And they, perhaps, in words and tears had spent
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>The little time of stay which Heav'n had lent;
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>But thus the Sibyl chides their long delay:
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>"Night rushes down, and headlong drives the day:
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>'T is here, in different paths, the way divides;
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>The right to Pluto's golden palace guides;
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>The left to that unhappy region tends,
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Which to the depth of Tartarus descends;
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>The seat of night profound, and punish'd fiends."
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>Then thus Deiphobus: "O sacred maid,
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>Forbear to chide, and be your will obey'd!
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Lo! to the secret shadows I retire,
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>To pay my penance till my years expire.
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>Proceed, auspicious prince, with glory crown'd,
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>And born to better fates than I have found."
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>He said; and, while he said, his steps he turn'd
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>To secret shadows, and in silence mourn'd.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>The hero, looking on the left, espied
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>A lofty tow'r, and strong on ev'ry side
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>With treble walls, which Phlegethon surrounds,
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>Whose fiery flood the burning empire bounds;
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>And, press'd betwixt the rocks, the bellowing noise 
<A NAME="768"></A>resounds
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Wide is the fronting gate, and, rais'd on high
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>With adamantine columns, threats the sky.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>Vain is the force of man, and Heav'n's as vain,
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>To crush the pillars which the pile sustain.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>Sublime on these a tow'r of steel is rear'd;
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>And dire Tisiphone there keeps the ward,
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>Girt in her sanguine gown, by night and day,
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>Observant of the souls that pass the downward way.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>From hence are heard the groans of ghosts, the pains
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>Of sounding lashes and of dragging chains.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>The Trojan stood astonish'd at their cries,
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>And ask'd his guide from whence those yells arise;
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>And what the crimes, and what the tortures were,
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>And loud laments that rent the liquid air.
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>She thus replied: "The chaste and holy race
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>Are all forbidden this polluted place.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>But Hecate, when she gave to rule the woods,
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>Then led me trembling thro' these dire abodes,
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>And taught the tortures of th' avenging gods.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>These are the realms of unrelenting fate;
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>And awful Rhadamanthus rules the state.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>He hears and judges each committed crime;
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>Enquires into the manner, place, and time.
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>The conscious wretch must all his acts reveal,
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>(Loth to confess, unable to conceal),
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>From the first moment of his vital breath,
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>To his last hour of unrepenting death.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>Straight, o'er the guilty ghost, the Fury shakes
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>The sounding whip and brandishes her snakes,
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>And the pale sinner, with her sisters, takes.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>Then, of itself, unfolds th' eternal door;
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>With dreadful sounds the brazen hinges roar.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>You see, before the gate, what stalking ghost
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Commands the guard, what sentries keep the post.
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>More formidable Hydra stands within,
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>Whose jaws with iron teeth severely grin.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>The gaping gulf low to the center lies,
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>And twice as deep as earth is distant from the skies.
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>The rivals of the gods, the Titan race,
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>Here, sing'd with lightning, roll within th' unfathom'd 
<A NAME="809"></A>space.
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>Here lie th' Alaean twins, (I saw them both,)
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>Enormous bodies, of gigantic growth,
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Who dar'd in fight the Thund'rer to defy,
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>Affect his heav'n, and force him from the sky.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Salmoneus, suff'ring cruel pains, I found,
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>For emulating Jove; the rattling sound
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>Of mimic thunder, and the glitt'ring blaze
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>Of pointed lightnings, and their forky rays.
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>Thro' Elis and the Grecian towns he flew;
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>Th' audacious wretch four fiery coursers drew:
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>He wav'd a torch aloft, and, madly vain,
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>Sought godlike worship from a servile train.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>Ambitious fool! with horny hoofs to pass
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>O'er hollow arches of resounding brass,
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>To rival thunder in its rapid course,
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>And imitate inimitable force!
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>But he, the King of Heav'n, obscure on high,
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>Bar'd his red arm, and, launching from the sky
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>His writhen bolt, not shaking empty smoke,
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>Down to the deep abyss the flaming felon strook.
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>There Tityus was to see, who took his birth
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>From heav'n, his nursing from the foodful earth.
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>Here his gigantic limbs, with large embrace,
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>Infold nine acres of infernal space.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>A rav'nous vulture, in his open'd side,
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>Her crooked beak and cruel talons tried;
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>Still for the growing liver digg'd his breast;
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>The growing liver still supplied the feast;
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>Still are his entrails fruitful to their pains:
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>Th' immortal hunger lasts, th' immortal food remains.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Ixion and Perithous I could name,
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>And more Thessalian chiefs of mighty fame.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>High o'er their heads a mold'ring rock is plac'd,
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>That promises a fall, and shakes at ev'ry blast.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>They lie below, on golden beds display'd;
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>And genial feasts with regal pomp are made.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>The Queen of Furies by their sides is set,
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>And snatches from their mouths th' untasted meat,
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>Which if they touch, her hissing snakes she rears,
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>Tossing her torch, and thund'ring in their ears.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>Then they, who brothers' better claim disown,
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>Expel their parents, and usurp the throne;
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>Defraud their clients, and, to lucre sold,
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>Sit brooding on unprofitable gold;
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>Who dare not give, and ev'n refuse to lend
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>To their poor kindred, or a wanting friend.
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>Vast is the throng of these; nor less the train
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>Of lustful youths, for foul adult'ry slain:
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>Hosts of deserters, who their honor sold,
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>And basely broke their faith for bribes of gold.
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>All these within the dungeon's depth remain,
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>Despairing pardon, and expecting pain.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>Ask not what pains; nor farther seek to know
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>Their process, or the forms of law below.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>Some roll a weighty stone; some, laid along,
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>And bound with burning wires, on spokes of wheels are 
<A NAME="866"></A>hung
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>Unhappy Theseus, doom'd for ever there,
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>Is fix'd by fate on his eternal chair;
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>And wretched Phlegyas warns the world with cries
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>(Could warning make the world more just or wise):
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>'Learn righteousness, and dread th' avenging deities.'
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>To tyrants others have their country sold,
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>Imposing foreign lords, for foreign gold;
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>Some have old laws repeal'd, new statutes made,
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>Not as the people pleas'd, but as they paid;
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>With incest some their daughters' bed profan'd:
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>All dar'd the worst of ills, and, what they dar'd, 
<A NAME="878"></A>attain'd.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>Had I a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues,
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>And throats of brass, inspir'd with iron lungs,
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>I could not half those horrid crimes repeat,
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>Nor half the punishments those crimes have met.
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>But let us haste our voyage to pursue:
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>The walls of Pluto's palace are in view;
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>The gate, and iron arch above it, stands
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>On anvils labor'd by the Cyclops' hands.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>Before our farther way the Fates allow,
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>Here must we fix on high the golden bough."
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>She said: and thro' the gloomy shades they pass'd,
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>And chose the middle path. Arriv'd at last,
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>The prince with living water sprinkled o'er
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>His limbs and body; then approach'd the door,
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>Possess'd the porch, and on the front above
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>He fix'd the fatal bough requir'd by Pluto's love.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>These holy rites perform'd, they took their way
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>Where long extended plains of pleasure lay:
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>The verdant fields with those of heav'n may vie,
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>With ether vested, and a purple sky;
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>The blissful seats of happy souls below.
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>Stars of their own, and their own suns, they know;
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>Their airy limbs in sports they exercise,
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>And on the green contend the wrestler's prize.
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>Some in heroic verse divinely sing;
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>Others in artful measures led the ring.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>The Thracian bard, surrounded by the rest,
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>There stands conspicuous in his flowing vest;
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>His flying fingers, and harmonious quill,
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>Strikes sev'n distinguish'd notes, and sev'n at once they 
<A NAME="909"></A>fill.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>Here found they Tsucer's old heroic race,
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>Born better times and happier years to grace.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>Assaracus and Ilus here enjoy
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>Perpetual fame, with him who founded Troy.
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>The chief beheld their chariots from afar,
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>Their shining arms, and coursers train'd to war:
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>Their lances fix'd in earth, their steeds around,
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>Free from their harness, graze the flow'ry ground.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>The love of horses which they had, alive,
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>And care of chariots, after death survive.
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>Some cheerful souls were feasting on the plain;
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>Some did the song, and some the choir maintain,
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>Beneath a laurel shade, where mighty Po
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>Mounts up to woods above, and hides his head below.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>Here patriots live, who, for their country's good,
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>In fighting fields, were prodigal of blood:
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>Priests of unblemish'd lives here make abode,
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>And poets worthy their inspiring god;
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>And searching wits, of more mechanic parts,
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>Who grac'd their age with new-invented arts:
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>Those who to worth their bounty did extend,
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>And those who knew that bounty to commend.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>The heads of these with holy fillets bound,
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>And all their temples were with garlands crown'd.
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>To these the Sibyl thus her speech address'd,
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>And first to him surrounded by the rest
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>(Tow'ring his height, and ample was his breast):
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>"Say, happy souls, divine Musaeus, say,
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>Where lives Anchises, and where lies our way
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>To find the hero, for whose only sake
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>We sought the dark abodes, and cross'd the bitter 
<A NAME="941"></A>lake?"
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>To this the sacred poet thus replied:
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>"In no fix'd place the happy souls reside.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>In groves we live, and lie on mossy beds,
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>By crystal streams, that murmur thro' the meads:
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>But pass yon easy hill, and thence descend;
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>The path conducts you to your journey's end."
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>This said, he led them up the mountain's brow,
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>And shews them all the shining fields below.
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>They wind the hill, and thro' the blissful meadows 
<A NAME="951"></A>go.
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>But old Anchises, in a flow'ry vale,
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>Review'd his muster'd race, and took the tale:
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>Those happy spirits, which, ordain'd by fate,
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>For future beings and new bodies wait-
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>With studious thought observ'd th' illustrious throng,
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>In nature's order as they pass'd along:
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>Their names, their fates, their conduct, and their 
<A NAME="959"></A>care,
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>In peaceful senates and successful war.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>He, when Aeneas on the plain appears,
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>Meets him with open arms, and falling tears.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>"Welcome," he said, "the gods' undoubted race!
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>O long expected to my dear embrace!
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>Once more 't is giv'n me to behold your face!
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>The love and pious duty which you pay
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>Have pass'd the perils of so hard a way.
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>'T is true, computing times, I now believ'd
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>The happy day approach'd; nor are my hopes deceiv'd.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>What length of lands, what oceans have you pass'd;
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>What storms sustain'd, and on what shores been cast?
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>How have I fear'd your fate! but fear'd it most,
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>When love assail'd you, on the Libyan coast."
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>To this, the filial duty thus replies:
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>"Your sacred ghost before my sleeping eyes
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>Appear'd, and often urg'd this painful enterprise.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>After long tossing on the Tyrrhene sea,
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>My navy rides at anchor in the bay.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>But reach your hand, O parent shade, nor shun
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>The dear embraces of your longing son!"
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>He said; and falling tears his face bedew:
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>Then thrice around his neck his arms he threw;
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>And thrice the flitting shadow slipp'd away,
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>Like winds, or empty dreams that fly the day.
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>Now, in a secret vale, the Trojan sees
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>A sep'rate grove, thro' which a gentle breeze
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>Plays with a passing breath, and whispers thro' the 
<A NAME="988"></A>trees;
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>And, just before the confines of the wood,
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>The gliding Lethe leads her silent flood.
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>About the boughs an airy nation flew,
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>Thick as the humming bees, that hunt the golden 
<A NAME="993"></A>dew;
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>In summer's heat on tops of lilies feed,
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>And creep within their bells, to suck the balmy 
<A NAME="996"></A>seed:
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>The winged army roams the fields around;
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>The rivers and the rocks remurmur to the sound.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>Aeneas wond'ring stood, then ask'd the cause
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>Which to the stream the crowding people draws.
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>Then thus the sire: "The souls that throng the flood
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>Are those to whom, by fate, are other bodies ow'd:
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>In Lethe's lake they long oblivion taste,
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>Of future life secure, forgetful of the past.
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>Long has my soul desir'd this time and place,
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>To set before your sight your glorious race,
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>That this presaging joy may fire your mind
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>To seek the shores by destiny design'd."-
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>"O father, can it be, that souls sublime
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>Return to visit our terrestrial clime,
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>And that the gen'rous mind, releas'd by death,
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>Can covet lazy limbs and mortal breath?"
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>Anchises then, in order, thus begun
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>To clear those wonders to his godlike son:
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>"Know, first, that heav'n, and earth's compacted 
<A NAME="1016"></A>frame,
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>And flowing waters, and the starry flame,
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>And both the radiant lights, one common soul
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>Inspires and feeds, and animates the whole.
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>This active mind, infus'd thro' all the space,
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>Unites and mingles with the mighty mass.
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>Hence men and beasts the breath of life obtain,
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>And birds of air, and monsters of the main.
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>Th' ethereal vigor is in all the same,
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>And every soul is fill'd with equal flame;
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>As much as earthy limbs, and gross allay
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>Of mortal members, subject to decay,
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>Blunt not the beams of heav'n and edge of day.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>From this coarse mixture of terrestrial parts,
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>Desire and fear by turns possess their hearts,
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>And grief, and joy; nor can the groveling mind,
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>In the dark dungeon of the limbs confin'd,
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>Assert the native skies, or own its heav'nly kind:
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>Nor death itself can wholly wash their stains;
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>But long-contracted filth ev'n in the soul remains.
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>The relics of inveterate vice they wear,
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>And spots of sin obscene in ev'ry face appear.
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>For this are various penances enjoin'd;
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>And some are hung to bleach upon the wind,
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>Some plung'd in waters, others purg'd in fires,
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>Till all the dregs are drain'd, and all the rust 
<A NAME="1042"></A>expires.
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>All have their manes, and those manes bear:
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>The few, so cleans'd, to these abodes repair,
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>And breathe, in ample fields, the soft Elysian air.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>Then are they happy, when by length of time
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>The scurf is worn away of each committed crime;
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>No speck is left of their habitual stains,
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>But the pure ether of the soul remains.
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>But, when a thousand rolling years are past,
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>(So long their punishments and penance last,)
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>Whole droves of minds are, by the driving god,
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>Compell'd to drink the deep Lethaean flood,
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>In large forgetful draughts to steep the cares
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>Of their past labors, and their irksome years,
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>That, unrememb'ring of its former pain,
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>The soul may suffer mortal flesh again."
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>Thus having said, the father spirit leads
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>The priestess and his son thro' swarms of shades,
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>And takes a rising ground, from thence to see
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>The long procession of his progeny.
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>"Survey," pursued the sire, "this airy throng,
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>As, offer'd to thy view, they pass along.
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>These are th' Italian names, which fate will join
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>With ours, and graff upon the Trojan line.
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>Observe the youth who first appears in sight,
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>And holds the nearest station to the light,
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>Already seems to snuff the vital air,
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>And leans just forward, on a shining spear:
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>Silvius is he, thy last-begotten race,
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>But first in order sent, to fill thy place;
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>An Alban name, but mix'd with Dardan blood,
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>Born in the covert of a shady wood:
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>Him fair Lavinia, thy surviving wife,
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>Shall breed in groves, to lead a solitary life.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>In Alba he shall fix his royal seat,
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>And, born a king, a race of kings beget.
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>Then Procas, honor of the Trojan name,
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>Capys, and Numitor, of endless fame.
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>A second Silvius after these appears;
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>Silvius Aeneas, for thy name he bears;
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>For arms and justice equally renown'd,
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>Who, late restor'd, in Alba shall be crown'd.
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>How great they look! how vig'rously they wield
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>Their weighty lances, and sustain the shield!
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>But they, who crown'd with oaken wreaths appear,
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>Shall Gabian walls and strong Fidena rear;
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>Nomentum, Bola, with Pometia, found;
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>And raise Collatian tow'rs on rocky ground.
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>All these shall then be towns of mighty fame,
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>Tho' now they lie obscure, and lands without a name.
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>See Romulus the great, born to restore
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>The crown that once his injur'd grandsire wore.
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>This prince a priestess of your blood shall bear,
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>And like his sire in arms he shall appear.
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>Two rising crests, his royal head adorn;
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>Born from a god, himself to godhead born:
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>His sire already signs him for the skies,
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>And marks the seat amidst the deities.
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>Auspicious chief! thy race, in times to come,
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>Shall spread the conquests of imperial Rome-
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>Rome, whose ascending tow'rs shall heav'n invade,
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>Involving earth and ocean in her shade;
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>High as the Mother of the Gods in place,
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>And proud, like her, of an immortal race.
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>Then, when in pomp she makes the Phrygian round,
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>With golden turrets on her temples crown'd;
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>A hundred gods her sweeping train supply;
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>Her offspring all, and all command the sky.
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>"Now fix your sight, and stand intent, to see
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>Your Roman race, and Julian progeny.
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>The mighty Caesar waits his vital hour,
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>Impatient for the world, and grasps his promis'd 
<A NAME="1114"></A>pow'r.
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>But next behold the youth of form divine,
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>Ceasar himself, exalted in his line;
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>Augustus, promis'd oft, and long foretold,
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>Sent to the realm that Saturn rul'd of old;
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>Born to restore a better age of gold.
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>Afric and India shall his pow'r obey;
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>He shall extend his propagated sway
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>Beyond the solar year, without the starry way,
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>Where Atlas turns the rolling heav'ns around,
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>And his broad shoulders with their lights are crown'd.
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>At his foreseen approach, already quake
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>The Caspian kingdoms and Maeotian lake:
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>Their seers behold the tempest from afar,
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>And threat'ning oracles denounce the war.
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>Nile hears him knocking at his sev'nfold gates,
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>And seeks his hidden spring, and fears his nephew's 
<A NAME="1131"></A>fates.
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>Nor Hercules more lands or labors knew,
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>Not tho' the brazen-footed hind he slew,
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>Freed Erymanthus from the foaming boar,
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR>And dipp'd his arrows in Lernaean gore;
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>Nor Bacchus, turning from his Indian war,
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>By tigers drawn triumphant in his car,
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR>From Nisus' top descending on the plains,
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>With curling vines around his purple reins.
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>And doubt we yet thro' dangers to pursue
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR>The paths of honor, and a crown in view?
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>But what's the man, who from afar appears?
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>His head with olive crown'd, his hand a censer bears,
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR>His hoary beard and holy vestments bring
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR>His lost idea back: I know the Roman king.
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>He shall to peaceful Rome new laws ordain,
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>Call'd from his mean abode a scepter to sustain.
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR>Him Tullus next in dignity succeeds,
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR>An active prince, and prone to martial deeds.
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR>He shall his troops for fighting fields prepare,
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR>Disus'd to toils, and triumphs of the war.
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR>By dint of sword his crown he shall increase,
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR>And scour his armor from the rust of peace.
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR>Whom Ancus follows, with a fawning air,
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>But vain within, and proudly popular.
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR>Next view the Tarquin kings, th' avenging sword
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR>Of Brutus, justly drawn, and Rome restor'd.
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR>He first renews the rods and ax severe,
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR>And gives the consuls royal robes to wear.
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR>His sons, who seek the tyrant to sustain,
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR>And long for arbitrary lords again,
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>With ignominy scourg'd, in open sight,
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR>He dooms to death deserv'd, asserting public right.
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR>Unhappy man, to break the pious laws
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR>Of nature, pleading in his children's cause!
<A NAME="1166"></A><BR>Howeer the doubtful fact is understood,
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR>'T is love of honor, and his country's good:
<A NAME="1168"></A><BR>The consul, not the father, sheds the blood.
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR>Behold Torquatus the same track pursue;
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR>And, next, the two devoted Decii view:
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR>The Drusian line, Camillus loaded home
<A NAME="1172"></A><BR>With standards well redeem'd, and foreign foes o'ercome
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR>The pair you see in equal armor shine,
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR>Now, friends below, in close embraces join;
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR>But, when they leave the shady realms of night,
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR>And, cloth'd in bodies, breathe your upper light,
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR>With mortal hate each other shall pursue:
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR>What wars, what wounds, what slaughter shall ensue!
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR>From Alpine heights the father first descends;
<A NAME="1180"></A><BR>His daughter's husband in the plain attends:
<A NAME="1181"></A><BR>His daughter's husband arms his eastern friends.
<A NAME="1182"></A><BR>Embrace again, my sons, be foes no more;
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR>Nor stain your country with her children's gore!
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR>And thou, the first, lay down thy lawless claim,
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR>Thou, of my blood, who bearist the Julian name!
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>Another comes, who shall in triumph ride,
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR>And to the Capitol his chariot guide,
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR>From conquer'd Corinth, rich with Grecian spoils.
<A NAME="1189"></A><BR>And yet another, fam'd for warlike toils,
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR>On Argos shall impose the Roman laws,
<A NAME="1191"></A><BR>And on the Greeks revenge the Trojan cause;
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR>Shall drag in chains their Achillean race;
<A NAME="1193"></A><BR>Shall vindicate his ancestors' disgrace,
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR>And Pallas, for her violated place.
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR>Great Cato there, for gravity renown'd,
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR>And conqu'ring Cossus goes with laurels crown'd.
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR>Who can omit the Gracchi? who declare
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR>The Scipios' worth, those thunderbolts of war,
<A NAME="1199"></A><BR>The double bane of Carthage? Who can see
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR>Without esteem for virtuous poverty,
<A NAME="1201"></A><BR>Severe Fabricius, or can cease t' admire
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR>The plowman consul in his coarse attire?
<A NAME="1203"></A><BR>Tir'd as I am, my praise the Fabii claim;
<A NAME="1204"></A><BR>And thou, great hero, greatest of thy name,
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR>Ordain'd in war to save the sinking state,
<A NAME="1206"></A><BR>And, by delays, to put a stop to fate!
<A NAME="1207"></A><BR>Let others better mold the running mass
<A NAME="1208"></A><BR>Of metals, and inform the breathing brass,
<A NAME="1209"></A><BR>And soften into flesh a marble face;
<A NAME="1210"></A><BR>Plead better at the bar; describe the skies,
<A NAME="1211"></A><BR>And when the stars descend, and when they rise.
<A NAME="1212"></A><BR>But, Rome, 't is thine alone, with awful sway,
<A NAME="1213"></A><BR>To rule mankind, and make the world obey,
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR>Disposing peace and war by thy own majestic way;
<A NAME="1215"></A><BR>To tame the proud, the fetter'd slave to free:
<A NAME="1216"></A><BR>These are imperial arts, and worthy thee."
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR>He paus'd; and, while with wond'ring eyes they view'd
<A NAME="1218"></A><BR>The passing spirits, thus his speech renew'd:
<A NAME="1219"></A><BR>"See great Marcellus! how, untir'd in toils,
<A NAME="1220"></A><BR>He moves with manly grace, how rich with regal spoils!
<A NAME="1221"></A><BR>He, when his country, threaten'd with alarms,
<A NAME="1222"></A><BR>Requires his courage and his conqu'ring arms,
<A NAME="1223"></A><BR>Shall more than once the Punic bands affright;
<A NAME="1224"></A><BR>Shall kill the Gaulish king in single fight;
<A NAME="1225"></A><BR>Then to the Capitol in triumph move,
<A NAME="1226"></A><BR>And the third spoils shall grace Feretrian Jove."
<A NAME="1227"></A><BR>Aeneas here beheld, of form divine,
<A NAME="1228"></A><BR>A godlike youth in glitt'ring armor shine,
<A NAME="1229"></A><BR>With great Marcellus keeping equal pace;
<A NAME="1230"></A><BR>But gloomy were his eyes, dejected was his face.
<A NAME="1231"></A><BR>He saw, and, wond'ring, ask'd his airy guide,
<A NAME="1232"></A><BR>What and of whence was he, who press'd the hero's 
<A NAME="1233"></A>side:
<A NAME="1234"></A><BR>"His son, or one of his illustrious name?
<A NAME="1235"></A><BR>How like the former, and almost the same!
<A NAME="1236"></A><BR>Observe the crowds that compass him around;
<A NAME="1237"></A><BR>All gaze, and all admire, and raise a shouting sound:
<A NAME="1238"></A><BR>But hov'ring mists around his brows are spread,
<A NAME="1239"></A><BR>And night, with sable shades, involves his head."
<A NAME="1240"></A><BR>"Seek not to know," the ghost replied with tears,
<A NAME="1241"></A><BR>"The sorrows of thy sons in future years.
<A NAME="1242"></A><BR>This youth (the blissful vision of a day)
<A NAME="1243"></A><BR>Shall just be shown on earth, and snatch'd away.
<A NAME="1244"></A><BR>The gods too high had rais'd the Roman state,
<A NAME="1245"></A><BR>Were but their gifts as permanent as great.
<A NAME="1246"></A><BR>What groans of men shall fill the Martian field!
<A NAME="1247"></A><BR>How fierce a blaze his flaming pile shall yield!
<A NAME="1248"></A><BR>What fun'ral pomp shall floating Tiber see,
<A NAME="1249"></A><BR>When, rising from his bed, he views the sad solemnity!
<A NAME="1250"></A><BR>No youth shall equal hopes of glory give,
<A NAME="1251"></A><BR>No youth afford so great a cause to grieve;
<A NAME="1252"></A><BR>The Trojan honor, and the Roman boast,
<A NAME="1253"></A><BR>Admir'd when living, and ador'd when lost!
<A NAME="1254"></A><BR>Mirror of ancient faith in early youth!
<A NAME="1255"></A><BR>Undaunted worth, inviolable truth!
<A NAME="1256"></A><BR>No foe, unpunish'd, in the fighting field
<A NAME="1257"></A><BR>Shall dare thee, foot to foot, with sword and shield;
<A NAME="1258"></A><BR>Much less in arms oppose thy matchless force,
<A NAME="1259"></A><BR>When thy sharp spurs shall urge thy foaming horse.
<A NAME="1260"></A><BR>Ah! couldst thou break thro' fate's severe decree,
<A NAME="1261"></A><BR>A new Marcellus shall arise in thee!
<A NAME="1262"></A><BR>Full canisters of fragrant lilies bring,
<A NAME="1263"></A><BR>Mix'd with the purple roses of the spring;
<A NAME="1264"></A><BR>Let me with fun'ral flow'rs his body strow;
<A NAME="1265"></A><BR>This gift which parents to their children owe,
<A NAME="1266"></A><BR>This unavailing gift, at least, I may bestow!"
<A NAME="1267"></A><BR>Thus having said, he led the hero round
<A NAME="1268"></A><BR>The confines of the blest Elysian ground;
<A NAME="1269"></A><BR>Which when Anchises to his son had shown,
<A NAME="1270"></A><BR>And fir'd his mind to mount the promis'd throne,
<A NAME="1271"></A><BR>He tells the future wars, ordain'd by fate;
<A NAME="1272"></A><BR>The strength and customs of the Latian state;
<A NAME="1273"></A><BR>The prince, and people; and forearms his care
<A NAME="1274"></A><BR>With rules, to push his fortune, or to bear.
<A NAME="1275"></A><BR>Two gates the silent house of Sleep adorn;
<A NAME="1276"></A><BR>Of polish'd ivory this, that of transparent horn:
<A NAME="1277"></A><BR>True visions thro' transparent horn arise;
<A NAME="1278"></A><BR>Thro' polish'd ivory pass deluding lies.
<A NAME="1279"></A><BR>Of various things discoursing as he pass'd,
<A NAME="1280"></A><BR>Anchises hither bends his steps at last.
<A NAME="1281"></A><BR>Then, thro' the gate of iv'ry, he dismiss'd
<A NAME="1282"></A><BR>His valiant offspring and divining guest.
<A NAME="1283"></A><BR>Straight to the ships Aeneas his way,
<A NAME="1284"></A><BR>Embark'd his men, and skimm'd along the sea,
<A NAME="1285"></A><BR>Still coasting, till he gain'd Cajeta's bay.
<A NAME="1286"></A><BR>At length on oozy ground his galleys moor;
<A NAME="1287"></A><BR>Their heads are turn'd to sea, their sterns to shore.
