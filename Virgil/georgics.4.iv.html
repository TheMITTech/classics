<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>Of air-born honey, gift of heaven, I now
<A NAME="11"></A><BR>Take up the tale. Upon this theme no less
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>Look thou, Maecenas, with indulgent eye.
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>A marvellous display of puny powers,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>High-hearted chiefs, a nation's history,
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Its traits, its bent, its battles and its clans,
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>All, each, shall pass before you, while I sing.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Slight though the poet's theme, not slight the praise,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>So frown not heaven, and Phoebus hear his call.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>First find your bees a settled sure abode,
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Where neither winds can enter (winds blow back
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>The foragers with food returning home)
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Nor sheep and butting kids tread down the flowers,
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Nor heifer wandering wide upon the plain
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Dash off the dew, and bruise the springing blades.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Let the gay lizard too keep far aloof
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>His scale-clad body from their honied stalls,
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>And the bee-eater, and what birds beside,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>And Procne smirched with blood upon the breast
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>From her own murderous hands. For these roam wide
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Wasting all substance, or the bees themselves
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Strike flying, and in their beaks bear home, to 
<A NAME="32"></A>glut
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Those savage nestlings with the dainty prey.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>But let clear springs and moss-green pools be near,
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>And through the grass a streamlet hurrying run,
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>Some palm-tree o'er the porch extend its shade,
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Or huge-grown oleaster, that in Spring,
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Their own sweet Spring-tide, when the new-made chiefs
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Lead forth the young swarms, and, escaped their 
<A NAME="40"></A>comb,
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>The colony comes forth to sport and play,
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>The neighbouring bank may lure them from the heat,
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Or bough befriend with hospitable shade.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>O'er the mid-waters, whether swift or still,
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Cast willow-branches and big stones enow,
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Bridge after bridge, where they may footing find
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>And spread their wide wings to the summer sun,
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>If haply Eurus, swooping as they pause,
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>Have dashed with spray or plunged them in the deep.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>And let green cassias and far-scented thymes,
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>And savory with its heavy-laden breath
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>Bloom round about, and violet-beds hard by
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Sip sweetness from the fertilizing springs.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>For the hive's self, or stitched of hollow bark,
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Or from tough osier woven, let the doors
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Be strait of entrance; for stiff winter's cold
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>Congeals the honey, and heat resolves and thaws,
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>To bees alike disastrous; not for naught
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>So haste they to cement the tiny pores
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>That pierce their walls, and fill the crevices
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>With pollen from the flowers, and glean and keep
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>To this same end the glue, that binds more fast
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Than bird-lime or the pitch from Ida's pines.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Oft too in burrowed holes, if fame be true,
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>They make their cosy subterranean home,
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>And deeply lodged in hollow rocks are found,
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Or in the cavern of an age-hewn tree.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Thou not the less smear round their crannied cribs
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>With warm smooth mud-coat, and strew leaves above;
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>But near their home let neither yew-tree grow,
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Nor reddening crabs be roasted, and mistrust
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>Deep marish-ground and mire with noisome smell,
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Or where the hollow rocks sonorous ring,
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>And the word spoken buffets and rebounds.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>What more? When now the golden sun has put
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Winter to headlong flight beneath the world,
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>And oped the doors of heaven with summer ray,
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Forthwith they roam the glades and forests o'er,
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Rifle the painted flowers, or sip the streams,
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Light-hovering on the surface. Hence it is
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>With some sweet rapture, that we know not of,
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Their little ones they foster, hence with skill
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Work out new wax or clinging honey mould.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>So when the cage-escaped hosts you see
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Float heavenward through the hot clear air, until
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>You marvel at yon dusky cloud that spreads
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>And lengthens on the wind, then mark them well;
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>For then 'tis ever the fresh springs they seek
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>And bowery shelter: hither must you bring
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>The savoury sweets I bid, and sprinkle them,
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Bruised balsam and the wax-flower's lowly weed,
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>And wake and shake the tinkling cymbals heard
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>By the great Mother: on the anointed spots
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>Themselves will settle, and in wonted wise
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Seek of themselves the cradle's inmost depth.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>But if to battle they have hied them forth-
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>For oft 'twixt king and king with uproar dire
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Fierce feud arises, and at once from far
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>You may discern what passion sways the mob,
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>And how their hearts are throbbing for the strife;
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Hark! the hoarse brazen note that warriors know
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Chides on the loiterers, and the ear may catch
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>A sound that mocks the war-trump's broken blasts;
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Then in hot haste they muster, then flash wings,
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Sharpen their pointed beaks and knit their thews,
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>And round the king, even to his royal tent,
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Throng rallying, and with shouts defy the foe.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>So, when a dry Spring and clear space is given,
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Forth from the gates they burst, they clash on high;
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>A din arises; they are heaped and rolled
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Into one mighty mass, and headlong fall,
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Not denselier hail through heaven, nor pelting so
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Rains from the shaken oak its acorn-shower.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Conspicuous by their wings the chiefs themselves
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>Press through the heart of battle, and display
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>A giant's spirit in each pigmy frame,
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>Steadfast no inch to yield till these or those
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>The victor's ponderous arm has turned to flight.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Such fiery passions and such fierce assaults
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>A little sprinkled dust controls and quells.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>And now, both leaders from the field recalled,
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Who hath the worser seeming, do to death,
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Lest royal waste wax burdensome, but let
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>His better lord it on the empty throne.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>One with gold-burnished flakes will shine like fire,
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>For twofold are their kinds, the nobler he,
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Of peerless front and lit with flashing scales;
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>That other, from neglect and squalor foul,
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Drags slow a cumbrous belly. As with kings,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>So too with people, diverse is their mould,
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Some rough and loathly, as when the wayfarer
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Scapes from a whirl of dust, and scorched with heat
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>Spits forth the dry grit from his parched mouth:
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>The others shine forth and flash with lightning-gleam,
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Their backs all blazoned with bright drops of gold
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Symmetric: this the likelier breed; from these,
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>When heaven brings round the season, thou shalt 
<A NAME="138"></A>strain
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>Sweet honey, nor yet so sweet as passing clear,
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>And mellowing on the tongue the wine-god's fire.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>But when the swarms fly aimlessly abroad,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Disport themselves in heaven and spurn their cells,
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Leaving the hive unwarmed, from such vain play
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Must you refrain their volatile desires,
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>Nor hard the task: tear off the monarchs' wings;
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>While these prove loiterers, none beside will dare
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Mount heaven, or pluck the standards from the camp.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Let gardens with the breath of saffron flowers
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Allure them, and the lord of Hellespont,
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Priapus, wielder of the willow-scythe,
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Safe in his keeping hold from birds and thieves.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>And let the man to whom such cares are dear
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Himself bring thyme and pine-trees from the heights,
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>And strew them in broad belts about their home;
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>No hand but his the blistering task should ply,
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Plant the young slips, or shed the genial showers.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>And I myself, were I not even now
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Furling my sails, and, nigh the journey's end,
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Eager to turn my vessel's prow to shore,
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Perchance would sing what careful husbandry
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Makes the trim garden smile; of Paestum too,
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Whose roses bloom and fade and bloom again;
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>How endives glory in the streams they drink,
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>And green banks in their parsley, and how the gourd
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Twists through the grass and rounds him to paunch;
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Nor of Narcissus had my lips been dumb,
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>That loiterer of the flowers, nor supple-stemmed
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>Acanthus, with the praise of ivies pale,
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>And myrtles clinging to the shores they love.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>For 'neath the shade of tall Oebalia's towers,
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Where dark Galaesus laves the yellowing fields,
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>An old man once I mind me to have seen-
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>From Corycus he came- to whom had fallen
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>Some few poor acres of neglected land,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>And they nor fruitful' neath the plodding steer,
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Meet for the grazing herd, nor good for vines.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Yet he, the while his meagre garden-herbs
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>Among the thorns he planted, and all round
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>White lilies, vervains, and lean poppy set,
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>In pride of spirit matched the wealth of kings,
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>And home returning not till night was late,
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>With unbought plenty heaped his board on high.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>He was the first to cull the rose in spring,
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>He the ripe fruits in autumn; and ere yet
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Winter had ceased in sullen ire to rive
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>The rocks with frost, and with her icy bit
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Curb in the running waters, there was he
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Plucking the rathe faint hyacinth, while he chid
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Summer's slow footsteps and the lagging West.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Therefore he too with earliest brooding bees
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>And their full swarms o'erflowed, and first was 
<A NAME="192"></A>he
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>To press the bubbling honey from the comb;
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Lime-trees were his, and many a branching pine;
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>And all the fruits wherewith in early bloom
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>The orchard-tree had clothed her, in full tale
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>Hung there, by mellowing autumn perfected.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>He too transplanted tall-grown elms a-row,
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Time-toughened pear, thorns bursting with the plum
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>And plane now yielding serviceable shade
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>For dry lips to drink under: but these things,
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Shut off by rigorous limits, I pass by,
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>And leave for others to sing after me.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Come, then, I will unfold the natural powers
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Great Jove himself upon the bees bestowed,
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>The boon for which, led by the shrill sweet strains
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Of the Curetes and their clashing brass,
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>They fed the King of heaven in Dicte's cave.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Alone of all things they receive and hold
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Community of offspring, and they house
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Together in one city, and beneath
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>The shelter of majestic laws they live;
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>And they alone fixed home and country know,
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>And in the summer, warned of coming cold,
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Make proof of toil, and for the general store
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Hoard up their gathered harvesting. For some
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Watch o'er the victualling of the hive, and these
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>By settled order ply their tasks afield;
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>And some within the confines of their home
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Plant firm the comb's first layer, Narcissus' tear,
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>And sticky gum oozed from the bark of trees,
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Then set the clinging wax to hang therefrom.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>Others the while lead forth the full-grown young,
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>Their country's hope, and others press and pack
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>The thrice repured honey, and stretch their cells
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>To bursting with the clear-strained nectar sweet.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Some, too, the wardship of the gates befalls,
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>Who watch in turn for showers and cloudy skies,
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Or ease returning labourers of their load,
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Or form a band and from their precincts drive
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>The drones, a lazy herd. How glows the work!
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>How sweet the honey smells of perfumed thyme
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Like the Cyclopes, when in haste they forge
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>From the slow-yielding ore the thunderbolts,
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Some from the bull's-hide bellows in and out
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Let the blasts drive, some dip i' the water-trough
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>The sputtering metal: with the anvil's weight
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Groans Etna: they alternately in time
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>With giant strength uplift their sinewy arms,
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Or twist the iron with the forceps' grip-
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Not otherwise, to measure small with great,
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>The love of getting planted in their breasts
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Goads on the bees, that haunt old Cecrops' heights,
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Each in his sphere to labour. The old have charge
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>To keep the town, and build the walled combs,
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>And mould the cunning chambers; but the youth,
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Their tired legs packed with thyme, come labouring 
<A NAME="248"></A>home
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Belated, for afar they range to feed
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>On arbutes and the grey-green willow-leaves,
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>And cassia and the crocus blushing red,
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Glue-yielding limes, and hyacinths dusky-eyed.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>One hour for rest have all, and one for toil:
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>With dawn they hurry from the gates- no room
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>For loiterers there: and once again, when even
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>Now bids them quit their pasturing on the plain,
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Then homeward make they, then refresh their strength:
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>A hum arises: hark! they buzz and buzz
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>About the doors and threshold; till at length
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>Safe laid to rest they hush them for the night,
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>And welcome slumber laps their weary limbs.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>But from the homestead not too far they fare,
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>When showers hang like to fall, nor, east winds 
<A NAME="264"></A>nigh,
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Confide in heaven, but 'neath the city walls
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>Safe-circling fetch them water, or essay
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Brief out-goings, and oft weigh-up tiny stones,
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>As light craft ballast in the tossing tide,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Wherewith they poise them through the cloudy vast.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>This law of life, too, by the bees obeyed,
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Will move thy wonder, that nor sex with sex
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Yoke they in marriage, nor yield their limbs to 
<A NAME="273"></A>love,
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Nor know the pangs of labour, but alone
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>From leaves and honied herbs, the mothers, each,
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>Gather their offspring in their mouths, alone
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Supply new kings and pigmy commonwealth,
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>And their old court and waxen realm repair.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>Oft, too, while wandering, against jagged stones
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Their wings they fray, and 'neath the burden yield
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Their liberal lives: so deep their love of flowers,
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>So glorious deem they honey's proud acquist.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Therefore, though each a life of narrow span,
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Ne'er stretched to summers more than seven, befalls,
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Yet deathless doth the race endure, and still
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Perennial stands the fortune of their line,
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>From grandsire unto grandsire backward told.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Moreover, not Aegyptus, nor the realm
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Of boundless Lydia, no, nor Parthia's hordes,
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Nor Median Hydaspes, to their king
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Do such obeisance: lives the king unscathed,
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>One will inspires the million: is he dead,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Snapt is the bond of fealty; they themselves
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>Ravage their toil-wrought honey, and rend amain
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Their own comb's waxen trellis. He is the lord
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Of all their labour; him with awful eye
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>They reverence, and with murmuring throngs surround,
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>In crowds attend, oft shoulder him on high,
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Or with their bodies shield him in the fight,
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>And seek through showering wounds a glorious death.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Led by these tokens, and with such traits to guide,
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Some say that unto bees a share is given
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Of the Divine Intelligence, and to drink
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>Pure draughts of ether; for God permeates all-
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Earth, and wide ocean, and the vault of heaven-
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>From whom flocks, herds, men, beasts of every kind,
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Draw each at birth the fine essential flame;
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>Yea, and that all things hence to Him return,
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Brought back by dissolution, nor can death
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Find place: but, each into his starry rank,
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Alive they soar, and mount the heights of heaven.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>If now their narrow home thou wouldst unseal,
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>And broach the treasures of the honey-house,
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>With draught of water first toment thy lips,
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>And spread before thee fumes of trailing smoke.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Twice is the teeming produce gathered in,
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Twofold their time of harvest year by year,
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Once when Taygete the Pleiad uplifts
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Her comely forehead for the earth to see,
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>With foot of scorn spurning the ocean-streams,
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Once when in gloom she flies the watery Fish,
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>And dips from heaven into the wintry wave.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Unbounded then their wrath; if hurt, they breathe
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>Venom into their bite, cleave to the veins
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>And let the sting lie buried, and leave their lives
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Behind them in the wound. But if you dread
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Too rigorous a winter, and would fain
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Temper the coming time, and their bruised hearts
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>And broken estate to pity move thy soul,
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Yet who would fear to fumigate with thyme,
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Or cut the empty wax away? for oft
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Into their comb the newt has gnawed unseen,
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>And the light-loathing beetles crammed their bed,
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>And he that sits at others' board to feast,
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>The do-naught drone; or 'gainst the unequal foe
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Swoops the fierce hornet, or the moth's fell tribe;
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Or spider, victim of Minerva's spite,
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Athwart the doorway hangs her swaying net.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>The more impoverished they, the keenlier all
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>To mend the fallen fortunes of their race
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Will nerve them, fill the cells up, tier on tier,
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>And weave their granaries from the rifled flowers.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Now, seeing that life doth even to bee-folk bring
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Our human chances, if in dire disease
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>Their bodies' strength should languish- which anon
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>By no uncertain tokens may be told-
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>Forthwith the sick change hue; grim leanness mars
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Their visage; then from out the cells they bear
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Forms reft of light, and lead the mournful pomp;
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>Or foot to foot about the porch they hang,
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>Or within closed doors loiter, listless all
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>From famine, and benumbed with shrivelling cold.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Then is a deep note heard, a long-drawn hum,
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>As when the chill South through the forests sighs,
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>As when the troubled ocean hoarsely booms
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>With back-swung billow, as ravening tide of fire
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Surges, shut fast within the furnace-walls.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Then do I bid burn scented galbanum,
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>And, honey-streams through reeden troughs instilled,
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Challenge and cheer their flagging appetite
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>To taste the well-known food; and it shall boot
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>To mix therewith the savour bruised from gall,
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>And rose-leaves dried, or must to thickness boiled
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>By a fierce fire, or juice of raisin-grapes
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>From Psithian vine, and with its bitter smell
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Centaury, and the famed Cecropian thyme.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>There is a meadow-flower by country folk
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Hight star-wort; 'tis a plant not far to seek;
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>For from one sod an ample growth it rears,
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Itself all golden, but girt with plenteous leaves,
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Where glory of purple shines through violet gloom.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>With chaplets woven hereof full oft are decked
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Heaven's altars: harsh its taste upon the tongue;
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Shepherds in vales smooth-shorn of nibbling flocks
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>By Mella's winding waters gather it.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>The roots of this, well seethed in fragrant wine,
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Set in brimmed baskets at their doors for food.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>But if one's whole stock fail him at a stroke,
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Nor hath he whence to breed the race anew,
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>'Tis time the wondrous secret to disclose
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Taught by the swain of Arcady, even how
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>The blood of slaughtered bullocks oft has borne
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Bees from corruption. I will trace me back
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>To its prime source the story's tangled thread,
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>And thence unravel. For where thy happy folk,
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Canopus, city of Pellaean fame,
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Dwell by the Nile's lagoon-like overflow,
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>And high o'er furrows they have called their own
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>Skim in their painted wherries; where, hard by,
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>The quivered Persian presses, and that flood
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>Which from the swart-skinned Aethiop bears him down,
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Swift-parted into sevenfold branching mouths
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>With black mud fattens and makes Aegypt green,
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>That whole domain its welfare's hope secure
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Rests on this art alone. And first is chosen
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>A strait recess, cramped closer to this end,
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Which next with narrow roof of tiles atop
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>'Twixt prisoning walls they pinch, and add hereto
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>From the four winds four slanting window-slits.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Then seek they from the herd a steer, whose horns
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>With two years' growth are curling, and stop fast,
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>Plunge madly as he may, the panting mouth
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>And nostrils twain, and done with blows to death,
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>Batter his flesh to pulp i' the hide yet whole,
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>And shut the doors, and leave him there to lie.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>But 'neath his ribs they scatter broken boughs,
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>With thyme and fresh-pulled cassias: this is done
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>When first the west winds bid the waters flow,
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Ere flush the meadows with new tints, and ere
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>The twittering swallow buildeth from the beams.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>Meanwhile the juice within his softened bones
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Heats and ferments, and things of wondrous birth,
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Footless at first, anon with feet and wings,
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Swarm there and buzz, a marvel to behold;
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>And more and more the fleeting breeze they take,
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>Till, like a shower that pours from summer-clouds,
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Forth burst they, or like shafts from quivering 
<A NAME="418"></A>string
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>When Parthia's flying hosts provoke the fray.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Say what was he, what God, that fashioned forth
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>This art for us, O Muses? of man's skill
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Whence came the new adventure? From thy vale,
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Peneian Tempe, turning, bee-bereft,
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>So runs the tale, by famine and disease,
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Mournful the shepherd Aristaeus stood
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Fast by the haunted river-head, and thus
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>With many a plaint to her that bare him cried:
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>"Mother, Cyrene, mother, who hast thy home
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Beneath this whirling flood, if he thou sayest,
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Apollo, lord of Thymbra, be my sire,
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Sprung from the Gods' high line, why barest thou 
<A NAME="432"></A>me
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>With fortune's ban for birthright? Where is now
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Thy love to me-ward banished from thy breast?
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>O! wherefore didst thou bid me hope for heaven?
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Lo! even the crown of this poor mortal life,
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Which all my skilful care by field and fold,
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>No art neglected, scarce had fashioned forth,
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Even this falls from me, yet thou call'st me son.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Nay, then, arise! With thine own hands pluck up
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>My fruit-plantations: on the homestead fling
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>Pitiless fire; make havoc of my crops;
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Burn the young plants, and wield the stubborn axe
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Against my vines, if there hath taken the
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Such loathing of my greatness." But that cry,
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Even from her chamber in the river-deeps,
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>His mother heard: around her spun the nymphs
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Milesian wool stained through with hyaline dye,
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>Drymo, Xantho, Ligea, Phyllodoce,
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>Their glossy locks o'er snowy shoulders shed,
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Cydippe and Lycorias yellow-haired,
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>A maiden one, one newly learned even then
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>To bear Lucina's birth-pang. Clio, too,
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>And Beroe, sisters, ocean-children both,
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>Both zoned with gold and girt with dappled fell,
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Ephyre and Opis, and from Asian meads
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Deiopea, and, bow at length laid by,
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Fleet-footed Arethusa. But in their midst
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Fair Clymene was telling o'er the tale
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Of Vulcan's idle vigilance and the stealth
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Of Mars' sweet rapine, and from Chaos old
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Counted the jostling love-joys of the Gods.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>Charmed by whose lay, the while their woolly tasks
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>With spindles down they drew, yet once again
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Smote on his mother's ears the mournful plaint
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>Of Aristaeus; on their glassy thrones
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Amazement held them all; but Arethuse
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Before the rest put forth her auburn head,
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Peering above the wave-top, and from far
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>Exclaimed, "Cyrene, sister, not for naught
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Scared by a groan so deep, behold! 'tis he,
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>Even Aristaeus, thy heart's fondest care,
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Here by the brink of the Peneian sire
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Stands woebegone and weeping, and by name
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Cries out upon thee for thy cruelty."
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>To whom, strange terror knocking at her heart,
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>"Bring, bring him to our sight," the mother cried;
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>"His feet may tread the threshold even of Gods."
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>So saying, she bids the flood yawn wide and yield
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>A pathway for his footsteps; but the wave
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Arched mountain-wise closed round him, and within
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>Its mighty bosom welcomed, and let speed
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>To the deep river-bed. And now, with eyes
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Of wonder gazing on his mother's hall
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>And watery kingdom and cave-prisoned pools
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>And echoing groves, he went, and, stunned by that
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Stupendous whirl of waters, separate saw
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>All streams beneath the mighty earth that glide,
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Phasis and Lycus, and that fountain-head
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Whence first the deep Enipeus leaps to light,
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>Whence father Tiber, and whence Anio's flood,
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>And Hypanis that roars amid his rocks,
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>And Mysian Caicus, and, bull-browed
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>'Twixt either gilded horn, Eridanus,
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>Than whom none other through the laughing plains
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>More furious pours into the purple sea.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Soon as the chamber's hanging roof of stone
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Was gained, and now Cyrene from her son
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Had heard his idle weeping, in due course
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Clear water for his hands the sisters bring,
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>With napkins of shorn pile, while others heap
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>The board with dainties, and set on afresh
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>The brimming goblets; with Panchaian fires
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>Upleap the altars; then the mother spake,
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>"Take beakers of Maconian wine," she said,
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>"Pour we to Ocean." Ocean, sire of all,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>She worships, and the sister-nymphs who guard
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>The hundred forests and the hundred streams;
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Thrice Vesta's fire with nectar clear she dashed,
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>Thrice to the roof-top shot the flame and shone:
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>Armed with which omen she essayed to speak:
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>"In Neptune's gulf Carpathian dwells a seer,
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Caerulean Proteus, he who metes the main
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>With fish-drawn chariot of two-footed steeds;
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Now visits he his native home once more,
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Pallene and the Emathian ports; to him
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>We nymphs do reverence, ay, and Nereus old;
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>For all things knows the seer, both those which 
<A NAME="519"></A>are
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>And have been, or which time hath yet to bring;
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>So willed it Neptune, whose portentous flocks,
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>And loathly sea-calves 'neath the surge he feeds.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Him first, my son, behoves thee seize and bind
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>That he may all the cause of sickness show,
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>And grant a prosperous end. For save by force
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>No rede will he vouchsafe, nor shalt thou bend
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>His soul by praying; whom once made captive, ply
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>With rigorous force and fetters; against these
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>His wiles will break and spend themselves in vain.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>I, when the sun has lit his noontide fires,
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>When the blades thirst, and cattle love the shade,
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Myself will guide thee to the old man's haunt,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Whither he hies him weary from the waves,
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>That thou mayst safelier steal upon his sleep.
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>But when thou hast gripped him fast with hand and 
<A NAME="536"></A>gyve,
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>Then divers forms and bestial semblances
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Shall mock thy grasp; for sudden he will change
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>To bristly boar, fell tigress, dragon scaled,
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>And tawny-tufted lioness, or send forth
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>A crackling sound of fire, and so shake of
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>The fetters, or in showery drops anon
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Dissolve and vanish. But the more he shifts
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>His endless transformations, thou, my son,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>More straitlier clench the clinging bands, until
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>His body's shape return to that thou sawest,
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>When with closed eyelids first he sank to sleep."
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>So saying, an odour of ambrosial dew
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>She sheds around, and all his frame therewith
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>Steeps throughly; forth from his trim-combed locks
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Breathed effluence sweet, and a lithe vigour leapt
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Into his limbs. There is a cavern vast
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>Scooped in the mountain-side, where wave on wave
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>By the wind's stress is driven, and breaks far up
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Its inmost creeks- safe anchorage from of old
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>For tempest-taken mariners: therewithin,
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Behind a rock's huge barrier, Proteus hides.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>Here in close covert out of the sun's eye
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>The youth she places, and herself the while
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>Swathed in a shadowy mist stands far aloof.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>And now the ravening dog-star that burns up
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>The thirsty Indians blazed in heaven; his course
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>The fiery sun had half devoured: the blades
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Were parched, and the void streams with droughty 
<A NAME="565"></A>jaws
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Baked to their mud-beds by the scorching ray,
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>When Proteus seeking his accustomed cave
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>Strode from the billows: round him frolicking
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>The watery folk that people the waste sea
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Sprinkled the bitter brine-dew far and wide.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Along the shore in scattered groups to feed
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>The sea-calves stretch them: while the seer himself,
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Like herdsman on the hills when evening bids
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>The steers from pasture to their stall repair,
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>And the lambs' bleating whets the listening wolves,
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Sits midmost on the rock and tells his tale.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>But Aristaeus, the foe within his clutch,
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>Scarce suffering him compose his aged limbs,
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>With a great cry leapt on him, and ere he rose
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Forestalled him with the fetters; he nathless,
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>All unforgetful of his ancient craft,
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Transforms himself to every wondrous thing,
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Fire and a fearful beast, and flowing stream.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>But when no trickery found a path for flight,
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Baffled at length, to his own shape returned,
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>With human lips he spake, "Who bade thee, then,
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>So reckless in youth's hardihood, affront
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Our portals? or what wouldst thou hence?"- But he,
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>"Proteus, thou knowest, of thine own heart thou 
<A NAME="590"></A>knowest;
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>For thee there is no cheating, but cease thou
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>To practise upon me: at heaven's behest
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>I for my fainting fortunes hither come
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>An oracle to ask thee." There he ceased.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Whereat the seer, by stubborn force constrained,
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Shot forth the grey light of his gleaming eyes
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Upon him, and with fiercely gnashing teeth
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Unlocks his lips to spell the fates of heaven:
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>"Doubt not 'tis wrath divine that plagues thee thus,
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Nor light the debt thou payest; 'tis Orpheus' self,
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>Orpheus unhappy by no fault of his,
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>So fates prevent not, fans thy penal fires,
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>Yet madly raging for his ravished bride.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>She in her haste to shun thy hot pursuit
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Along the stream, saw not the coming death,
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Where at her feet kept ward upon the bank
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>In the tall grass a monstrous water-snake.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>But with their cries the Dryad-band her peers
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Filled up the mountains to their proudest peaks:
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Wailed for her fate the heights of Rhodope,
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>And tall Pangaea, and, beloved of Mars,
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>The land that bowed to Rhesus, Thrace no less
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>With Hebrus' stream; and Orithyia wept,
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>Daughter of Acte old. But Orpheus' self,
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>Soothing his love-pain with the hollow shell,
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>Thee his sweet wife on the lone shore alone,
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Thee when day dawned and when it died he sang.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Nay to the jaws of Taenarus too he came,
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>Of Dis the infernal palace, and the grove
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Grim with a horror of great darkness- came,
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Entered, and faced the Manes and the King
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Of terrors, the stone heart no prayer can tame.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>Then from the deepest deeps of Erebus,
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>Wrung by his minstrelsy, the hollow shades
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>Came trooping, ghostly semblances of forms
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>Lost to the light, as birds by myriads hie
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>To greenwood boughs for cover, when twilight-hour
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>Or storms of winter chase them from the hills;
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Matrons and men, and great heroic frames
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>Done with life's service, boys, unwedded girls,
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Youths placed on pyre before their fathers' eyes.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>Round them, with black slime choked and hideous 
<A NAME="633"></A>weed,
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>Cocytus winds; there lies the unlovely swamp
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>Of dull dead water, and, to pen them fast,
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Styx with her ninefold barrier poured between.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Nay, even the deep Tartarean Halls of death
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Stood lost in wonderment, and the Eumenides,
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Their brows with livid locks of serpents twined;
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Even Cerberus held his triple jaws agape,
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>And, the wind hushed, Ixion's wheel stood still.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>And now with homeward footstep he had passed
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>All perils scathless, and, at length restored,
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Eurydice to realms of upper air
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>Had well-nigh won, behind him following-
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>So Proserpine had ruled it- when his heart
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>A sudden mad desire surprised and seized-
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Meet fault to be forgiven, might Hell forgive.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>For at the very threshold of the day,
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Heedless, alas! and vanquished of resolve,
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>He stopped, turned, looked upon Eurydice
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>His own once more. But even with the look,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Poured out was all his labour, broken the bond
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>Of that fell tyrant, and a crash was heard
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>Three times like thunder in the meres of hell.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>'Orpheus! what ruin hath thy frenzy wrought
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>On me, alas! and thee? Lo! once again
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>The unpitying fates recall me, and dark sleep
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Closes my swimming eyes. And now farewell:
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>Girt with enormous night I am borne away,
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>Outstretching toward thee, thine, alas! no more,
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>These helpless hands.' She spake, and suddenly,
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>Like smoke dissolving into empty air,
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>Passed and was sundered from his sight; nor him
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Clutching vain shadows, yearning sore to speak,
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>Thenceforth beheld she, nor no second time
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Hell's boatman brooks he pass the watery bar.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>What should he do? fly whither, twice bereaved?
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>Move with what tears the Manes, with what voice
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>The Powers of darkness? She indeed even now
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Death-cold was floating on the Stygian barge!
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>For seven whole months unceasingly, men say,
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Beneath a skyey crag, by thy lone wave,
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>Strymon, he wept, and in the caverns chill
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Unrolled his story, melting tigers' hearts,
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>And leading with his lay the oaks along.
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>As in the poplar-shade a nightingale
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Mourns her lost young, which some relentless swain,
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Spying, from the nest has torn unfledged, but she
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Wails the long night, and perched upon a spray
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>With sad insistence pipes her dolorous strain,
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Till all the region with her wrongs o'erflows.
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>No love, no new desire, constrained his soul:
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>By snow-bound Tanais and the icy north,
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>Far steppes to frost Rhipaean forever wed,
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>Alone he wandered, lost Eurydice
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>Lamenting, and the gifts of Dis ungiven.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>Scorned by which tribute the Ciconian dames,
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>Amid their awful Bacchanalian rites
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>And midnight revellings, tore him limb from limb,
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>And strewed his fragments over the wide fields.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>Then too, even then, what time the Hebrus stream,
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>Oeagrian Hebrus, down mid-current rolled,
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Rent from the marble neck, his drifting head,
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>The death-chilled tongue found yet a voice to cry
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>'Eurydice! ah! poor Eurydice!'
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>With parting breath he called her, and the banks
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>From the broad stream caught up 'Eurydice!'"
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>So Proteus ending plunged into the deep,
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>And, where he plunged, beneath the eddying whirl
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>Churned into foam the water, and was gone;
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>But not Cyrene, who unquestioned thus
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>Bespake the trembling listener: "Nay, my son,
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>From that sad bosom thou mayst banish care:
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Hence came that plague of sickness, hence the nymphs,
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>With whom in the tall woods the dance she wove,
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Wrought on thy bees, alas! this deadly bane.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Bend thou before the Dell-nymphs, gracious powers:
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>Bring gifts, and sue for pardon: they will grant
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>Peace to thine asking, and an end of wrath.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>But how to approach them will I first unfold-
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>Four chosen bulls of peerless form and bulk,
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>That browse to-day the green Lycaean heights,
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Pick from thy herds, as many kine to match,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>Whose necks the yoke pressed never: then for these
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>Build up four altars by the lofty fanes,
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>And from their throats let gush the victims' blood,
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>And in the greenwood leave their bodies lone.
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>Then, when the ninth dawn hath displayed its beams,
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>To Orpheus shalt thou send his funeral dues,
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>Poppies of Lethe, and let slay a sheep
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Coal-black, then seek the grove again, and soon
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>For pardon found adore Eurydice
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>With a slain calf for victim."
<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR><B>No delay:</B>
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>The self-same hour he hies him forth to do
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>His mother's bidding: to the shrine he came,
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>The appointed altars reared, and thither led
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>Four chosen bulls of peerless form and bulk,
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>With kine to match, that never yoke had known;
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Then, when the ninth dawn had led in the day,
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>To Orpheus sent his funeral dues, and sought
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>The grove once more. But sudden, strange to tell
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>A portent they espy: through the oxen's flesh,
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Waxed soft in dissolution, hark! there hum
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>Bees from the belly; the rent ribs overboil
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>In endless clouds they spread them, till at last
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>On yon tree-top together fused they cling,
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>And drop their cluster from the bending boughs.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>So sang I of the tilth of furrowed fields,
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>Of flocks and trees, while Caesar's majesty
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>Launched forth the levin-bolts of war by deep
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>Euphrates, and bare rule o'er willing folk
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>Though vanquished, and essayed the heights of heaven.
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>I Virgil then, of sweet Parthenope
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>The nursling, wooed the flowery walks of peace
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>Inglorious, who erst trilled for shepherd-wights
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>The wanton ditty, and sang in saucy youth
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Thee, Tityrus, 'neath the spreading beech tree's 
<A NAME="750"></A>shade.
