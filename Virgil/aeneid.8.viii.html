<A NAME="10"></A>When Turnus had assembled all his pow'rs,
<A NAME="11"></A><BR>His standard planted on Laurentum's tow'rs;
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar,
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Had giv'n the signal of approaching war,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>Had rous'd the neighing steeds to scour the fields,
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>While the fierce riders clatter'd on their shields;
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>To join th' allies, and headlong rush to war.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd,
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>With bold Mezentius, who blasphem'd aloud.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>These thro' the country took their wasteful course,
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>The fields to forage, and to gather force.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Then Venulus to Diomede they send,
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>To beg his aid Ausonia to defend,
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>Declare the common danger, and inform
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>The Grecian leader of the growing storm:
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Aeneas, landed on the Latian coast,
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>With banish'd gods, and with a baffled host,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Yet now aspir'd to conquest of the state,
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>And claim'd a title from the gods and fate;
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>What num'rous nations in his quarrel came,
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>And how they spread his formidable name.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>What he design'd, what mischief might arise,
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>If fortune favor'd his first enterprise,
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Was left for him to weigh, whose equal fears,
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>And common interest, was involv'd in theirs.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>While Turnus and th' allies thus urge the war,
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>The Trojan, floating in a flood of care,
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>This way and that he turns his anxious mind;
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Thinks, and rejects the counsels he design'd;
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Explores himself in vain, in ev'ry part,
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>And gives no rest to his distracted heart.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>So, when the sun by day, or moon by night,
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Strike on the polish'd brass their trembling light,
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>The glitt'ring species here and there divide,
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>And cast their dubious beams from side to side;
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>Now on the walls, now on the pavement play,
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>And to the ceiling flash the glaring day.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>'T was night; and weary nature lull'd asleep
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>The birds of air, and fishes of the deep,
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>And beasts, and mortal men. The Trojan chief
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>Was laid on Tiber's banks, oppress'd with grief,
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>And found in silent slumber late relief.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Then, thro' the shadows of the poplar wood,
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Arose the father of the Roman flood;
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>An azure robe was o'er his body spread,
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>A wreath of shady reeds adorn'd his head:
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Thus, manifest to sight, the god appear'd,
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>And with these pleasing words his sorrow cheer'd:
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>"Undoubted offspring of ethereal race,
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>O long expected in this promis'd place!
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Who thro' the foes hast borne thy banish'd gods,
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Restor'd them to their hearths, and old abodes;
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>This is thy happy home, the clime where fate
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Ordains thee to restore the Trojan state.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Fear not! The war shall end in lasting peace,
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>And all the rage of haughty Juno cease.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>And that this nightly vision may not seem
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Th' effect of fancy, or an idle dream,
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>A sow beneath an oak shall lie along,
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>All white herself, and white her thirty young.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>When thirty rolling years have run their race,
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Thy son Ascanius, on this empty space,
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Shall build a royal town, of lasting fame,
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Which from this omen shall receive the name.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Time shall approve the truth. For what remains,
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>And how with sure success to crown thy pains,
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>With patience next attend. A banish'd band,
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Driv'n with Evander from th' Arcadian land,
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Have planted here, and plac'd on high their walls;
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Their town the founder Pallanteum calls,
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Deriv'd from Pallas, his great-grandsire's name:
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>But the fierce Latians old possession claim,
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>With war infesting the new colony.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>These make thy friends, and on their aid rely.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>To thy free passage I submit my streams.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Wake, son of Venus, from thy pleasing dreams;
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>And, when the setting stars are lost in day,
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>To Juno's pow'r thy just devotion pay;
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>With sacrifice the wrathful queen appease:
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Her pride at length shall fall, her fury cease.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>When thou return'st victorious from the war,
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Perform thy vows to me with grateful care.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>The god am I, whose yellow water flows
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Around these fields, and fattens as it goes:
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>Tiber my name; among the rolling floods
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Renown'd on earth, esteem'd among the gods.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>This is my certain seat. In times to come,
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>My waves shall wash the walls of mighty Rome."
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>He said, and plung'd below. While yet he spoke,
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>His dream Aeneas and his sleep forsook.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>He rose, and looking up, beheld the skies
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>With purple blushing, and the day arise.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Then water in his hollow palm he took
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>From Tiber's flood, and thus the pow'rs bespoke:
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>"Laurentian nymphs, by whom the streams are fed,
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>And Father Tiber, in thy sacred bed
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Receive Aeneas, and from danger keep.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Whatever fount, whatever holy deep,
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>Conceals thy wat'ry stores; where'er they rise,
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>And, bubbling from below, salute the skies;
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Thou, king of horned floods, whose plenteous urn
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Suffices fatness to the fruitful corn,
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>For this thy kind compassion of our woes,
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>Shalt share my morning song and ev'ning vows.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>But, O be present to thy people's aid,
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>And firm the gracious promise thou hast made!"
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Thus having said, two galleys from his stores,
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>With care he chooses, mans, and fits with oars.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Now on the shore the fatal swine is found.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Wondrous to tell!- She lay along the ground:
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Her well-fed offspring at her udders hung;
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>She white herself, and white her thirty young.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Aeneas takes the mother and her brood,
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>And all on Juno's altar are bestow'd.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>The foll'wing night, and the succeeding day,
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Propitious Tiber smooth'd his wat'ry way:
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>He roll'd his river back, and pois'd he stood,
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>A gentle swelling, and a peaceful flood.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>The Trojans mount their ships; they put from shore,
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Borne on the waves, and scarcely dip an oar.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Shouts from the land give omen to their course,
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>And the pitch'd vessels glide with easy force.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>The woods and waters wonder at the gleam
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Of shields, and painted ships that stem the stream.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>One summer's night and one whole day they pass
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Betwixt the greenwood shades, and cut the liquid 
<A NAME="138"></A>glass.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>The fiery sun had finish'd half his race,
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>Look'd back, and doubted in the middle space,
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>When they from far beheld the rising tow'rs,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>The tops of sheds, and shepherds' lowly bow'rs,
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Thin as they stood, which, then of homely clay,
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Now rise in marble, from the Roman sway.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>These cots (Evander's kingdom, mean and poor)
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>The Trojan saw, and turn'd his ships to shore.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>'T was on a solemn day: th' Arcadian states,
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>The king and prince, without the city gates,
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Then paid their off'rings in a sacred grove
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>To Hercules, the warrior son of Jove.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Thick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies,
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>And fat of entrails on his altar fries.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>But, when they saw the ships that stemm'd the flood,
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>And glitter'd thro' the covert of the wood,
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>They rose with fear, and left th' unfinish'd feast,
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Till dauntless Pallas reassur'd the rest
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>To pay the rites. Himself without delay
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>A jav'lin seiz'd, and singly took his way;
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Then gain'd a rising ground, and call'd from far:
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>"Resolve me, strangers, whence, and what you are;
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Your bus'ness here; and bring you peace or war?"
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>High on the stern Aeneas his stand,
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>And held a branch of olive in his hand,
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>While thus he spoke: "The Phrygians' arms you see,
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Expell'd from Troy, provok'd in Italy
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>By Latian foes, with war unjustly made;
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>At first affianc'd, and at last betray'd.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>This message bear: 'The Trojans and their chief
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Bring holy peace, and beg the king's relief.'
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Struck with so great a name, and all on fire,
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>The youth replies: "Whatever you require,
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Your fame exacts. Upon our shores descend.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>A welcome guest, and, what you wish, a friend."
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>He said, and, downward hasting to the strand,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Embrac'd the stranger prince, and join'd his hand.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Conducted to the grove, Aeneas broke
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>The silence first, and thus the king bespoke:
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>"Best of the Greeks, to whom, by fate's command,
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>I bear these peaceful branches in my hand,
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Undaunted I approach you, tho' I know
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Your birth is Grecian, and your land my foe;
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>From Atreus tho' your ancient lineage came,
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>And both the brother kings your kindred claim;
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>Yet, my self-conscious worth, your high renown,
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Your virtue, thro' the neighb'ring nations blown,
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>Our fathers' mingled blood, Apollo's voice,
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Have led me hither, less by need than choice.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Our founder Dardanus, as fame has sung,
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>And Greeks acknowledge, from Electra sprung:
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Electra from the loins of Atlas came;
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Atlas, whose head sustains the starry frame.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Your sire is Mercury, whom long before
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>On cold Cyllene's top fair Maia bore.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Maia the fair, on fame if we rely,
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Was Atlas' daughter, who sustains the sky.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Thus from one common source our streams divide;
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>Ours is the Trojan, yours th' Areadian side.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Rais'd by these hopes, I sent no news before,
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Nor ask'd your leave, nor did your faith implore;
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>But come, without a pledge, my own ambassador.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>The same Rutulians, who with arms pursue
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>The Trojan race, are equal foes to you.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Our host expell'd, what farther force can stay
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>The victor troops from universal sway?
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Then will they stretch their pow'r athwart the land,
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>And either sea from side to side command.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Receive our offer'd faith, and give us thine;
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Ours is a gen'rous and experienc'd line:
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>We want not hearts nor bodies for the war;
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>In council cautious, and in fields we dare."
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>He said; and while spoke, with piercing eyes
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>Evander view'd the man with vast surprise,
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Pleas'd with his action, ravish'd with his face:
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Then answer'd briefly, with a royal grace:
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>"O valiant leader of the Trojan line,
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>In whom the features of thy father shine,
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>How I recall Anchises! how I see
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>His motions, mien, and all my friend, in thee!
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Long tho' it be, 't is fresh within my mind,
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>When Priam to his sister's court design'd
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>A welcome visit, with a friendly stay,
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>And thro' th' Arcadian kingdom took his way.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>Then, past a boy, the callow down began
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>To shade my chin, and call me first a man.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>I saw the shining train with vast delight,
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>And Priam's goodly person pleas'd my sight:
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>But great Anchises, far above the rest,
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>With awful wonder fir'd my youthful breast.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>I long'd to join in friendship's holy bands
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Our mutual hearts, and plight our mutual hands.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>I first accosted him: I sued, I sought,
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>And, with a loving force, to Pheneus brought.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>He gave me, when at length constrain'd to go,
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>A Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow,
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>A vest embroider'd, glorious to behold,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>And two rich bridles, with their bits of gold,
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Which my son's coursers in obedience hold.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>The league you ask, I offer, as your right;
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>And, when to-morrow's sun reveals the light,
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>With swift supplies you shall be sent away.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Now celebrate with us this solemn day,
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Whose holy rites admit no long delay.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Honor our annual feast; and take your seat,
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>With friendly welcome, at a homely treat."
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Thus having said, the bowls (remov'd for fear)
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>The youths replac'd, and soon restor'd the cheer.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>On sods of turf he set the soldiers round:
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>A maple throne, rais'd higher from the ground,
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Receiv'd the Trojan chief; and, o'er the bed,
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>A lion's shaggy hide for ornament they spread.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>The loaves were serv'd in canisters; the wine
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>In bowls; the priest renew'd the rites divine:
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Broil'd entrails are their food, and beef's continued 
<A NAME="254"></A>chine.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>But when the rage of hunger was repress'd,
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>Thus spoke Evander to his royal guest:
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>"These rites, these altars, and this feast, O king,
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>From no vain fears or superstition spring,
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Or blind devotion, or from blinder chance,
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>Or heady zeal, or brutal ignorance;
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>But, sav'd from danger, with a grateful sense,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>The labors of a god we recompense.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>See, from afar, yon rock that mates the sky,
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>About whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie;
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Such indigested ruin; bleak and bare,
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>How desart now it stands, expos'd in air!
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>'T was once a robber's den, inclos'd around
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>With living stone, and deep beneath the ground.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>The monster Cacus, more than half a beast,
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>This hold, impervious to the sun, possess'd.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>The pavement ever foul with human gore;
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Heads, and their mangled members, hung the door.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Vulcan this plague begot; and, like his sire,
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Black clouds he belch'd, and flakes of livid fire.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Time, long expected, eas'd us of our load,
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>And brought the needful presence of a god.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Th' avenging force of Hercules, from Spain,
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>Arriv'd in triumph, from Geryon slain:
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>Thrice liv'd the giant, and thrice liv'd in vain.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>His prize, the lowing herds, Alcides drove
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Near Tiber's bank, to graze the shady grove.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>Allur'd with hope of plunder, and intent
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>By force to rob, by fraud to circumvent,
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>The brutal Cacus, as by chance they stray'd,
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Four oxen thence, and four fair kine convey'd;
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>And, lest the printed footsteps might be seen,
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>He dragg'd 'em backwards to his rocky den.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>The tracks averse a lying notice gave,
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>And led the searcher backward from the cave.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>"Meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place,
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>To find fresh pasture and untrodden grass.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>The beasts, who miss'd their mates, fill'd all around
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>With bellowings, and the rocks restor'd the sound.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>One heifer, who had heard her love complain,
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Roar'd from the cave, and made the project vain.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Alcides found the fraud; with rage he shook,
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>And toss'd about his head his knotted oak.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Swift as the winds, or Scythian arrows' flight,
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>He clomb, with eager haste, th' aerial height.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>Then first we saw the monster mend his pace;
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Fear his eyes, and paleness in his face,
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Confess'd the god's approach. Trembling he springs,
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>As terror had increas'd his feet with wings;
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>Nor stay'd for stairs; but down the depth he threw
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>His body, on his back the door he drew
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>(The door, a rib of living rock; with pains
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>His father hew'd it out, and bound with iron chains):
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>He broke the heavy links, the mountain clos'd,
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>And bars and levers to his foe oppos'd.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>The wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast;
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>The fierce avenger came with bounding haste;
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Survey'd the mouth of the forbidden hold,
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>And here and there his raging eyes he roll'd.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>He gnash'd his teeth; and thrice he compass'd round
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>With winged speed the circuit of the ground.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Thrice at the cavern's mouth he pull'd in vain,
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>And, panting, thrice desisted from his pain.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>A pointed flinty rock, all bare and black,
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Grew gibbous from behind the mountain's back;
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Owls, ravens, all ill omens of the night,
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Here built their nests, and hither wing'd their 
<A NAME="322"></A>flight.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>The leaning head hung threat'ning o'er the flood,
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>And nodded to the left. The hero stood
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Adverse, with planted feet, and, from the right,
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Tugg'd at the solid stone with all his might.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Thus heav'd, the fix'd foundations of the rock
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Gave way; heav'n echo'd at the rattling shock.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Tumbling, it chok'd the flood: on either side
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>The banks leap backward, and the streams divide;
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>The sky shrunk upward with unusual dread,
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>And trembling Tiber div'd beneath his bed.
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>The court of Cacus stands reveal'd to sight;
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>The cavern glares with new-admitted light.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>So the pent vapors, with a rumbling sound,
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Heave from below, and rend the hollow ground;
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>A sounding flaw succeeds; and, from on high,
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>The gods with hate beheld the nether sky:
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>The ghosts repine at violated night,
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>And curse th' invading sun, and sicken at the sight.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>The graceless monster, caught in open day,
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>Inclos'd, and in despair to fly away,
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Howls horrible from underneath, and fills
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>His hollow palace with unmanly yells.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>The hero stands above, and from afar
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>Plies him with darts, and stones, and distant war.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>He, from his nostrils huge mouth, expires
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Black clouds of smoke, amidst his father's fires,
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Gath'ring, with each repeated blast, the night,
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>To make uncertain aim, and erring sight.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>The wrathful god then plunges from above,
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>And, where in thickest waves the sparkles drove,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>There lights; and wades thro' fumes, and gropes his 
<A NAME="354"></A>way,
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Half sing'd, half stifled, till he grasps his prey.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>The monster, spewing fruitless flames, he found;
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>He squeez'd his throat; he writh'd his neck around,
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>And in a knot his crippled members bound;
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Then from their sockets tore his burning eyes:
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Roll'd on a heap, the breathless robber lies.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>The doors, unbarr'd, receive the rushing day,
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>And thoro' lights disclose the ravish'd prey.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>The bulls, redeem'd, breathe open air again.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Next, by the feet, they drag him from his den.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>The wond'ring neighborhood, with glad surprise,
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Behold his shagged breast, his giant size,
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>His mouth that flames no more, and his extinguish'd 
<A NAME="368"></A>eyes.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>From that auspicious day, with rites divine,
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>We worship at the hero's holy shrine.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Potitius first ordain'd these annual vows:
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>As priests, were added the Pinarian house,
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Who rais'd this altar in the sacred shade,
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Where honors, ever due, for ever shall be paid.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>For these deserts, and this high virtue shown,
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Ye warlike youths, your heads with garlands crown:
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood,
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>And with deep draughts invoke our common god."
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>This said, a double wreath Evander twin'd,
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>And poplars black and white his temples bind.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Then brims his ample bowl. With like design
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>The rest invoke the gods, with sprinkled wine.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Meantime the sun descended from the skies,
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>And the bright evening star began to rise.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>And now the priests, Potitius at their head,
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>In skins of beasts involv'd, the long procession 
<A NAME="387"></A>led;
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Held high the flaming tapers in their hands,
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>As custom had prescrib'd their holy bands;
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Then with a second course the tables load,
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>And with full chargers offer to the god.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>The Salii sing, and cense his altars round
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>With Saban smoke, their heads with poplar bound-
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>One choir of old, another of the young,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>To dance, and bear the burthen of the song.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>The lay records the labors, and the praise,
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>And all th' immortal acts of Hercules:
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>First, how the mighty babe, when swath'd in bands,
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>The serpents strangled with his infant hands;
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Then, as in years and matchless force he grew,
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Th' Oechalian walls, and Trojan, overthrew.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>Besides, a thousand hazards they relate,
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Procur'd by Juno's and Eurystheus' hate:
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>"Thy hands, unconquer'd hero, could subdue
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>The cloud-born Centaurs, and the monster crew:
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Nor thy resistless arm the bull withstood,
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Nor he, the roaring terror of the wood.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>The triple porter of the Stygian seat,
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>With lolling tongue, lay fawning at thy feet,
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>And, seiz'd with fear, forgot his mangled meat.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>Th' infernal waters trembled at thy sight;
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Thee, god, no face of danger could affright;
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Not huge Typhoeus, nor th' unnumber'd snake,
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Increas'd with hissing heads, in Lerna's lake.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Hail, Jove's undoubted son! an added grace
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>To heav'n and the great author of thy race!
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Receive the grateful off'rings which we pay,
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>And smile propitious on thy solemn day!"
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>In numbers thus they sung; above the rest,
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>The den and death of Cacus crown the feast.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>The woods to hollow vales convey the sound,
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>The vales to hills, and hills the notes rebound.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>The rites perform'd, the cheerful train retire.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Betwixt young Pallas and his aged sire,
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>The Trojan pass'd, the city to survey,
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>And pleasing talk beguil'd the tedious way.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>The stranger cast around his curious eyes,
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>New objects viewing still, with new surprise;
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>With greedy joy enquires of various things,
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>And acts and monuments of ancient kings.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Then thus the founder of the Roman tow'rs:
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>"These woods were first the seat of sylvan pow'rs,
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Of Nymphs and Fauns, and salvage men, who took
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Nor laws they knew, nor manners, nor the care
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Of lab'ring oxen, or the shining share,
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Nor arts of gain, nor what they gain'd to spare.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Their exercise the chase; the running flood
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Supplied their thirst, the trees supplied their 
<A NAME="440"></A>food.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Then Saturn came, who fled the pow'r of Jove,
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>Robb'd of his realms, and banish'd from above.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>The men, dispers'd on hills, to towns he brought,
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>And laws ordain'd, and civil customs taught,
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>And Latium call'd the land where safe he lay
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>From his unduteous son, and his usurping sway.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>With his mild empire, peace and plenty came;
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>And hence the golden times deriv'd their name.
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>A more degenerate and discolor'd age
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>Succeeded this, with avarice and rage.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Th' Ausonians then, and bold Sicanians came;
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>And Saturn's empire often chang'd the name.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Then kings, gigantic Tybris, and the rest,
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>With arbitrary sway the land oppress'd:
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>For Tiber's flood was Albula before,
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Till, from the tyrant's fate, his name it bore.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>I last arriv'd, driv'n from my native home
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>By fortune's pow'r, and fate's resistless doom.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Long toss'd on seas, I sought this happy land,
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Warn'd by my mother nymph, and call'd by Heav'n's 
<A NAME="461"></A>command."
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Thus, walking on, he spoke, and shew'd the gate,
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>Since call'd Carmental by the Roman state;
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Where stood an altar, sacred to the name
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Of old Carmenta, the prophetic dame,
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>Who to her son foretold th' Aenean race,
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Sublime in fame, and Rome's imperial place:
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Then shews the forest, which, in after times,
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Fierce Romulus for perpetrated crimes
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>A sacred refuge made; with this, the shrine
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Where Pan below the rock had rites divine:
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>Then tells of Argus' death, his murder'd guest,
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Whose grave and tomb his innocence attest.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Thence, to the steep Tarpeian rock he leads;
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Now roof'd with gold, then thatch'd with homely 
<A NAME="476"></A>reeds.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>A reverent fear (such superstition reigns
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>Among the rude) ev'n then possess'd the swains.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Some god, they knew- what god, they could not tell-
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Did there amidst the sacred horror dwell.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Th' Arcadians thought him Jove; and said they saw
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>The mighty Thund'rer with majestic awe,
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Who took his shield, and dealt his bolts around,
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>And scatter'd tempests on the teeming ground.
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Then saw two heaps of ruins, (once they stood
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Two stately towns, on either side the flood,)
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Saturnia's and Janicula's remains;
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>And either place the founder's name retains.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Discoursing thus together, they resort
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Where poor Evander kept his country court.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>They view'd the ground of Rome's litigious hall;
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>(Once oxen low'd, where now the lawyers bawl;)
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Then, stooping, thro' the narrow gate they press'd,
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest:
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>"Mean as it is, this palace, and this door,
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Receiv'd Alcides, then a conqueror.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Dare to be poor; accept our homely food,
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Which feasted him, and emulate a god."
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Then underneath a lowly roof he led
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>The weary prince, and laid him on a bed;
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>The stuffing leaves, with hides of bears o'erspread.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Now Night had shed her silver dews around,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>And with her sable wings embrac'd the ground,
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>When love's fair goddess, anxious for her son,
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>(New tumults rising, and new wars begun,)
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Couch'd with her husband in his golden bed,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>With these alluring words invokes his aid;
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>And, that her pleasing speech his mind may move,
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Inspires each accent with the charms of love:
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>"While cruel fate conspir'd with Grecian pow'rs,
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>To level with the ground the Trojan tow'rs,
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>I ask'd not aid th' unhappy to restore,
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Nor did the succor of thy skill implore;
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Nor urg'd the labors of my lord in vain,
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>A sinking empire longer to sustain,
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Tho'much I ow'd to Priam's house, and more
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>The dangers of Aeneas did deplore.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>But now, by Jove's command, and fate's decree,
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>His race is doom'd to reign in Italy:
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>With humble suit I beg thy needful art,
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>O still propitious pow'r, that rules my heart!
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>A mother kneels a suppliant for her son.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>By Thetis and Aurora thou wert won
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>To forge impenetrable shields, and grace
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>With fated arms a less illustrious race.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Behold, what haughty nations are combin'd
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Against the relics of the Phrygian kind,
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>With fire and sword my people to destroy,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>And conquer Venus twice, in conqu'ring Troy."
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>She said; and straight her arms, of snowy hue,
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>About her unresolving husband threw.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Her soft embraces soon infuse desire;
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>His bones and marrow sudden warmth inspire;
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>And all the godhead feels the wonted fire.
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>Not half so swift the rattling thunder flies,
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>Or forky lightnings flash along the skies.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>The goddess, proud of her successful wiles,
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>And conscious of her form, in secret smiles.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Then thus the pow'r, obnoxious to her charms,
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Panting, and half dissolving in her arms:
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>"Why seek you reasons for a cause so just,
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Or your own beauties or my love distrust?
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Long since, had you requir'd my helpful hand,
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Th' artificer and art you might command,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>To labor arms for Troy: nor Jove, nor fate,
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Confin'd their empire to so short a date.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>And, if you now desire new wars to wage,
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>My skill I promise, and my pains engage.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Whatever melting metals can conspire,
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>Or breathing bellows, or the forming fire,
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Is freely yours: your anxious fears remove,
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>And think no task is difficult to love."
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>Trembling he spoke; and, eager of her charms,
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>He snatch'd the willing goddess to his arms;
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Till in her lap infus'd, he lay possess'd
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Of full desire, and sunk to pleasing rest.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Now when the Night her middle race had rode,
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>And his first slumber had refresh'd the god-
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>The time when early housewives leave the bed;
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>When living embers on the hearth they spread,
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Supply the lamp, and call the maids to rise-
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>With yawning mouths, and with half-open'd eyes,
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>They ply the distaff by the winking light,
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>And to their daily labor add the night:
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Thus frugally they earn their children's bread,
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>And uncorrupted keep the nuptial bed-
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Not less concern'd, nor at a later hour,
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>Rose from his downy couch the forging pow'r.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Sacred to Vulcan's name, an isle there lay,
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Betwixt Sicilia's coasts and Lipare,
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Rais'd high on smoking rocks; and, deep below,
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>In hollow caves the fires of Aetna glow.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>The Cyclops here their heavy hammers deal;
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Loud strokes, and hissings of tormented steel,
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Are heard around; the boiling waters roar,
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>And smoky flames thro' fuming tunnels soar.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Hether the Father of the Fire, by night,
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>Thro' the brown air precipitates his flight.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>On their eternal anvils here he found
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>The brethren beating, and the blows go round.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>A load of pointless thunder now there lies
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Before their hands, to ripen for the skies:
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>These darts, for angry Jove, they daily cast;
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>Consum'd on mortals with prodigious waste.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Three rays of writhen rain, of fire three more,
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Of winged southern winds and cloudy store
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>As many parts, the dreadful mixture frame;
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>And fears are added, and avenging flame.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>Inferior ministers, for Mars, repair
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>His broken axletrees and blunted war,
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>And send him forth again with furbish'd arms,
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>To wake the lazy war with trumpets' loud alarms.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>The rest refresh the scaly snakes that fold
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>The shield of Pallas, and renew their gold.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Full on the crest the Gorgon's head they place,
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>With eyes that roll in death, and with distorted 
<A NAME="597"></A>face.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>"My sons," said Vulcan, "set your tasks aside;
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>Your strength and master-skill must now be tried.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Arms for a hero forge; arms that require
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>Your force, your speed, and all your forming fire."
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>He said. They set their former work aside,
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>And their new toils with eager haste divide.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>A flood of molten silver, brass, and gold,
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>And deadly steel, in the large furnace roll'd;
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Of this, their artful hands a shield prepare,
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>Alone sufficient to sustain the war.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>Sev'n orbs within a spacious round they close:
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>One stirs the fire, and one the bellows blows.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>The hissing steel is in the smithy drown'd;
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>The grot with beaten anvils groans around.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>By turns their arms advance, in equal time;
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>By turns their hands descend, and hammers chime.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>They turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs;
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>The fiery work proceeds, with rustic songs.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>While, at the Lemnian god's command, they urge
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Their labors thus, and ply th' Aeolian forge,
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>The cheerful morn salutes Evander's eyes,
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>And songs of chirping birds invite to rise.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>He leaves his lowly bed: his buskins meet
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Above his ankles; sandals sheathe his feet:
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>He sets his trusty sword upon his side,
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>And o'er his shoulder throws a panther's hide.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>Two menial dogs before their master press'd.
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>Thus clad, and guarded thus, he seeks his kingly 
<A NAME="626"></A>guest.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Mindful of promis'd aid, he mends his pace,
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>But meets Aeneas in the middle space.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Young Pallas did his father's steps attend,
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>And true Achates waited on his friend.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>They join their hands; a secret seat they choose;
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>Th' Arcadian first their former talk renews:
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>"Undaunted prince, I never can believe
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>The Trojan empire lost, while you survive.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>Command th' assistance of a faithful friend;
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>But feeble are the succors I can send.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Our narrow kingdom here the Tiber bounds;
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>That other side the Latian state surrounds,
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Insults our walls, and wastes our fruitful grounds.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>But mighty nations I prepare, to join
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Their arms with yours, and aid your just design.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>You come, as by your better genius sent,
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>And fortune seems to favor your intent.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Not far from hence there stands a hilly town,
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>Of ancient building, and of high renown,
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Torn from the Tuscans by the Lydian race,
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Who gave the name of Caere to the place,
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Once Agyllina call'd. It flourish'd long,
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>In pride of wealth and warlike people strong,
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Till curs'd Mezentius, in a fatal hour,
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>Assum'd the crown, with arbitrary pow'r.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>What words can paint those execrable times,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>The subjects' suff'rings, and the tyrant's crimes!
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>That blood, those murthers, O ye gods, replace
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>On his own head, and on his impious race!
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>The living and the dead at his command
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>Were coupled, face to face, and hand to hand,
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Till, chok'd with stench, in loath'd embraces tied,
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>The ling'ring wretches pin'd away and died.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>Thus plung'd in ills, and meditating more-
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>The people's patience, tir'd, no longer bore
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>The raging monster; but with arms beset
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>His house, and vengeance and destruction threat.
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>They fire his palace: while the flame ascends,
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>They force his guards, and execute his friends.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>He cleaves the crowd, and, favor'd by the night,
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>To Turnus' friendly court directs his flight.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>By just revenge the Tuscans set on fire,
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>With arms, their king to punishment require:
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Their num'rous troops, now muster'd on the strand,
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>My counsel shall submit to your command.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Their navy swarms upon the coasts; they cry
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>To hoist their anchors, but the gods deny.
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>An ancient augur, skill'd in future fate,
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>With these foreboding words restrains their hate:
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>'Ye brave in arms, ye Lydian blood, the flow'r
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>Of Tuscan youth, and choice of all their pow'r,
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Whom just revenge against Mezentius arms,
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>To seek your tyrant's death by lawful arms;
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Know this: no native of our land may lead
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>This pow'rful people; seek a foreign head.'
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Aw'd with these words, in camps they still abide,
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>And wait with longing looks their promis'd guide.
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Tarchon, the Tuscan chief, to me has sent
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>Their crown, and ev'ry regal ornament:
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>The people join their own with his desire;
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>And all my conduct, as their king, require.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>But the chill blood that creeps within my veins,
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>And age, and listless limbs unfit for pains,
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>And a soul conscious of its own decay,
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Have forc'd me to refuse imperial sway.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>My Pallas were more fit to mount the throne,
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>And should, but he's a Sabine mother's son,
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>And half a native; but, in you, combine
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>A manly vigor, and a foreign line.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Where Fate and smiling Fortune shew the way,
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Pursue the ready path to sov'reign sway.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>The staff of my declining days, my son,
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>Shall make your good or ill success his own;
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>In fighting fields from you shall learn to dare,
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>And serve the hard apprenticeship of war;
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Your matchless courage and your conduct view,
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>And early shall begin t' admire and copy you.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Besides, two hundred horse he shall command;
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Tho' few, a warlike and well-chosen band.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>These in my name are listed; and my son
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>As many more has added in his own."
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Scarce had he said; Achates and his guest,
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>With downcast eyes, their silent grief express'd;
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>Who, short of succors, and in deep despair,
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>Shook at the dismal prospect of the war.
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>But his bright mother, from a breaking cloud,
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>To cheer her issue, thunder'd thrice aloud;
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Thrice forky lightning flash'd along the sky,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>And Tyrrhene trumpets thrice were heard on high.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>Then, gazing up, repeated peals they hear;
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>And, in a heav'n serene, refulgent arms appear:
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Redd'ning the skies, and glitt'ring all around,
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>The temper'd metals clash, and yield a silver sound.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>The rest stood trembling, struck with awe divine;
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>Aeneas only, conscious to the sign,
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Presag'd th' event, and joyful view'd, above,
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Th' accomplish'd promise of the Queen of Love.
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>Then, to th' Arcadian king: "This prodigy
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>(Dismiss your fear) belongs alone to me.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Heav'n calls me to the war: th' expected sign
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>Is giv'n of promis'd aid, and arms divine.
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>My goddess mother, whose indulgent care
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>Foresaw the dangers of the growing war,
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>This omen gave, when bright Vulcanian arms,
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Fated from force of steel by Stygian charms,
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Suspended, shone on high: she then foreshow'd
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Approaching fights, and fields to float in blood.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>Turnus shall dearly pay for faith forsworn;
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>And corps, and swords, and shields, on Tiber borne,
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>Shall choke his flood: now sound the loud alarms;
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>And, Latian troops, prepare your perjur'd arms."
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>He said, and, rising from his homely throne,
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>The solemn rites of Hercules begun,
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>And on his altars wak'd the sleeping fires;
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>Then cheerful to his household gods retires;
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>There offers chosen sheep. Th' Arcadian king
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>And Trojan youth the same oblations bring.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>Next, of his men and ships he makes review;
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Draws out the best and ablest of the crew.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>Down with the falling stream the refuse run,
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>To raise with joyful news his drooping son.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Steeds are prepar'd to mount the Trojan band,
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Who wait their leader to the Tyrrhene land.
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>A sprightly courser, fairer than the rest,
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>The king himself presents his royal guest:
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>A lion's hide his back and limbs infold,
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Precious with studded work, and paws of gold.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>Fame thro' the little city spreads aloud
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>Th' intended march, amid the fearful crowd:
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>The matrons beat their breasts, dissolve in tears,
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>And double their devotion in their fears.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>The war at hand appears with more affright,
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>And rises ev'ry moment to the sight.
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Then old Evander, with a close embrace,
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Strain'd his departing friend; and tears o'erflow his 
<A NAME="762"></A>face.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>"Would Heav'n," said he, "my strength and youth 
<A NAME="764"></A>recall,
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>Such as I was beneath Praeneste's wall;
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>Then when I made the foremost foes retire,
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>And set whole heaps of conquer'd shields on fire;
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>When Herilus in single fight I slew,
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Whom with three lives Feronia did endue;
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>And thrice I sent him to the Stygian shore,
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>Till the last ebbing soul return'd no more-
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>Such if I stood renew'd, not these alarms,
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>Nor death, should rend me from my Pallas' arms;
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>Nor proud Mezentius, thus unpunish'd, boast
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>His rapes and murthers on the Tuscan coast.
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>Ye gods, and mighty Jove, in pity bring
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Relief, and hear a father and a king!
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>If fate and you reserve these eyes, to see
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>My son return with peace and victory;
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>If the lov'd boy shall bless his father's sight;
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>If we shall meet again with more delight;
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>Then draw my life in length; let me sustain,
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>In hopes of his embrace, the worst of pain.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>But if your hard decrees- which, O! I dread-
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>Have doom'd to death his undeserving head;
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>This, O this very moment, let me die!
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>While hopes and fears in equal balance lie;
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>While, yet possess'd of all his youthful charms,
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>I strain him close within these aged arms;
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>Before that fatal news my soul shall wound!"
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>He said, and, swooning, sunk upon the ground.
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>His servants bore him off, and softly laid
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>His languish'd limbs upon his homely bed.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>The horsemen march; the gates are open'd wide;
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>Aeneas at their head, Achates by his side.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>Next these, the Trojan leaders rode along;
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>Last follows in the rear th' Arcadian throng.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>Young Pallas shone conspicuous o'er the rest;
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>Gilded his arms, embroider'd was his vest.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>So, from the seas, exerts his radiant head
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>The star by whom the lights of heav'n are led;
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Shakes from his rosy locks the pearly dews,
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>Dispels the darkness, and the day renews.
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>The trembling wives the walls and turrets crowd,
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>And follow, with their eyes, the dusty cloud,
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>Which winds disperse by fits, and shew from far
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>The blaze of arms, and shields, and shining war.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>The troops, drawn up in beautiful array,
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>O'er heathy plains pursue the ready way.
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>Repeated peals of shouts are heard around;
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>The neighing coursers answer to the sound,
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>And shake with horny hoofs the solid ground.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>A greenwood shade, for long religion known,
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Stands by the streams that wash the Tuscan town,
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>Incompass'd round with gloomy hills above,
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>Which add a holy horror to the grove.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>The first inhabitants of Grecian blood,
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>That sacred forest to Silvanus vow'd,
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>The guardian of their flocks and fields; and pay
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>Their due devotions on his annual day.
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>Not far from hence, along the river's side,
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>In tents secure, the Tuscan troops abide,
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>By Tarchon led. Now, from a rising ground,
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Aeneas cast his wond'ring eyes around,
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>And all the Tyrrhene army had in sight,
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>Stretch'd on the spacious plain from left to right.
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>Thether his warlike train the Trojan led,
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>Refresh'd his men, and wearied horses fed.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>Meantime the mother goddess, crown'd with charms,
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>Breaks thro' the clouds, and brings the fated arms.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>Within a winding vale she finds her son,
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>On the cool river's banks, retir'd alone.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>She shews her heav'nly form without disguise,
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>And gives herself to his desiring eyes.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>"Behold," she said, "perform'd in ev'ry part,
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>My promise made, and Vulcan's labor'd art.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>Now seek, secure, the Latian enemy,
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>And haughty Turnus to the field defy."
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>She said; and, having first her son embrac'd,
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>The radiant arms beneath an oak she plac'd,
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>Proud of the gift, he roll'd his greedy sight
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>Around the work, and gaz'd with vast delight.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>He lifts, he turns, he poises, and admires
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>The crested helm, that vomits radiant fires:
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>His hands the fatal sword and corslet hold,
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>One keen with temper'd steel, one stiff with gold:
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>Both ample, flaming both, and beamy bright;
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>So shines a cloud, when edg'd with adverse light.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>He shakes the pointed spear, and longs to try
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>The plated cuishes on his manly thigh;
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>But most admires the shield's mysterious mold,
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>And Roman triumphs rising on the gold:
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>For these, emboss'd, the heav'nly smith had wrought
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>(Not in the rolls of future fate untaught)
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>The wars in order, and the race divine
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>Of warriors issuing from the Julian line.
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>The cave of Mars was dress'd with mossy greens:
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>There, by the wolf, were laid the martial twins.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>Intrepid on her swelling dugs they hung;
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>The foster dam loll'd out her fawning tongue:
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>They suck'd secure, while, bending back her head,
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>She lick'd their tender limbs, and form'd them as they 
<A NAME="863"></A>fed.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>Not far from thence new Rome appears, with games
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>Projected for the rape of Sabine dames.
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>The pit resounds with shrieks; a war succeeds,
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>For breach of public faith, and unexampled deeds.
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>Here for revenge the Sabine troops contend;
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>The Romans there with arms the prey defend.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>Wearied with tedious war, at length they cease;
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>And both the kings and kingdoms plight the peace.
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>The friendly chiefs before Jove's altar stand,
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>Both arm'd, with each a charger in his hand:
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>A fatted sow for sacrifice is led,
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>With imprecations on the perjur'd head.
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>Near this, the traitor Metius, stretch'd between
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>Four fiery steeds, is dragg'd along the green,
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>By Tullus' doom: the brambles drink his blood,
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>And his torn limbs are left the vulture's food.
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>There, Porsena to Rome proud Tarquin brings,
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>And would by force restore the banish'd kings.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>One tyrant for his fellow-tyrant fights;
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>The Roman youth assert their native rights.
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>Before the town the Tuscan army lies,
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>To win by famine, or by fraud surprise.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>Their king, half-threat'ning, half-disdaining stood,
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>While Cocles broke the bridge, and stemm'd the flood.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>The captive maids there tempt the raging tide,
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>Scap'd from their chains, with Cloelia for their 
<A NAME="890"></A>guide.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>High on a rock heroic Manlius stood,
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>To guard the temple, and the temple's god.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>Then Rome was poor; and there you might behold
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>The palace thatch'd with straw, now roof'd with 
<A NAME="895"></A>gold.
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>The silver goose before the shining gate
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>There flew, and, by her cackle, sav'd the state.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>She told the Gauls' approach; th' approaching Gauls,
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>Obscure in night, ascend, and seize the walls.
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>The gold dissembled well their yellow hair,
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>And golden chains on their white necks they wear.
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>Gold are their vests; long Alpine spears they wield,
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>And their left arm sustains a length of shield.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>Hard by, the leaping Salian priests advance;
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>And naked thro' the streets the mad Luperci dance,
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>In caps of wool; the targets dropp'd from heav'n.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>Here modest matrons, in soft litters driv'n,
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>To pay their vows in solemn pomp appear,
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>And odorous gums in their chaste hands they bear.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>Far hence remov'd, the Stygian seats are seen;
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>Pains of the damn'd, and punish'd Catiline
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>Hung on a rock- the traitor; and, around,
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>The Furies hissing from the nether ground.
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>Apart from these, the happy souls he draws,
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>And Cato's holy ghost dispensing laws.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>Betwixt the quarters flows a golden sea;
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>But foaming surges there in silver play.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>The dancing dolphins with their tails divide
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>The glitt'ring waves, and cut the precious tide.
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>Amid the main, two mighty fleets engage
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>Their brazen beaks, oppos'd with equal rage.
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>Actium surveys the well-disputed prize;
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>Leucate's wat'ry plain with foamy billows fries.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>Young Caesar, on the stern, in armor bright,
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>Here leads the Romans and their gods to fight:
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>His beamy temples shoot their flames afar,
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>And o'er his head is hung the Julian star.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>Agrippa seconds him, with prosp'rous gales,
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>And, with propitious gods, his foes assails:
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>A naval crown, that binds his manly brows,
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>The happy fortune of the fight foreshows.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>Rang'd on the line oppos'd, Antonius brings
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>Barbarian aids, and troops of Eastern kings;
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>Th' Arabians near, and Bactrians from afar,
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>Of tongues discordant, and a mingled war:
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>And, rich in gaudy robes, amidst the strife,
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>His ill fate follows him- th' Egyptian wife.
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>Moving they fight; with oars and forky prows
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>The froth is gather'd, and the water glows.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>It seems, as if the Cyclades again
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>Were rooted up, and justled in the main;
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>Or floating mountains floating mountains meet;
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>Such is the fierce encounter of the fleet.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>Fireballs are thrown, and pointed jav'lins fly;
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>The fields of Neptune take a purple dye.
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>The queen herself, amidst the loud alarms,
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>With cymbals toss'd her fainting soldiers warms-
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>Fool as she was! who had not yet divin'd
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>Her cruel fate, nor saw the snakes behind.
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>Her country gods, the monsters of the sky,
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>Great Neptune, Pallas, and Love's Queen defy:
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>The dog Anubis barks, but barks in vain,
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>Nor longer dares oppose th' ethereal train.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>Mars in the middle of the shining shield
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>Is grav'd, and strides along the liquid field.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>The Dirae souse from heav'n with swift descent;
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>And Discord, dyed in blood, with garments rent,
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>Divides the prease: her steps Bellona treads,
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>And shakes her iron rod above their heads.
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>This seen, Apollo, from his Actian height,
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>Pours down his arrows; at whose winged flight
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>The trembling Indians and Egyptians yield,
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>And soft Sabaeans quit the wat'ry field.
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>The fatal mistress hoists her silken sails,
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>And, shrinking from the fight, invokes the gales.
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>Aghast she looks, and heaves her breast for breath,
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>Panting, and pale with fear of future death.
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>The god had figur'd her as driv'n along
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>By winds and waves, and scudding thro' the throng.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>Just opposite, sad Nilus opens wide
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>His arms and ample bosom to the tide,
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>And spreads his mantle o'er the winding coast,
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>In which he wraps his queen, and hides the flying 
<A NAME="974"></A>host.
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>The victor to the gods his thanks express'd,
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>And Rome, triumphant, with his presence bless'd.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>Three hundred temples in the town he plac'd;
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>With spoils and altars ev'ry temple grac'd.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>Three shining nights, and three succeeding days,
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>The fields resound with shouts, the streets with 
<A NAME="981"></A>praise,
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>The domes with songs, the theaters with plays.
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>All altars flame: before each altar lies,
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>Drench'd in his gore, the destin'd sacrifice.
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>Great Caesar sits sublime upon his throne,
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>Before Apollo's porch of Parian stone;
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>Accepts the presents vow'd for victory,
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>And hangs the monumental crowns on high.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>Vast crowds of vanquish'd nations march along,
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>Various in arms, in habit, and in tongue.
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>Here, Mulciber assigns the proper place
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>For Carians, and th' ungirt Numidian race;
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>Then ranks the Thracians in the second row,
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>With Scythians, expert in the dart and bow.
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>And here the tam'd Euphrates humbly glides,
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>And there the Rhine submits her swelling tides,
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>And proud Araxes, whom no bridge could bind;
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>The Danes' unconquer'd offspring march behind,
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>And Morini, the last of humankind.
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>These figures, on the shield divinely wrought,
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>By Vulcan labor'd, and by Venus brought,
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>With joy and wonder fill the hero's thought.
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>Unknown the names, he yet admires the grace,
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>And bears aloft the fame and fortune of his race.
