<A NAME="10"></A>Meantime the Trojan cuts his wat'ry way,
<A NAME="11"></A><BR>Fix'd on his voyage, thro' the curling sea;
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>Then, casting back his eyes, with dire amaze,
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Sees on the Punic shore the mounting blaze.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>The cause unknown; yet his presaging mind
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>The fate of Dido from the fire divin'd;
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>He knew the stormy souls of womankind,
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>What secret springs their eager passions move,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>How capable of death for injur'd love.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Dire auguries from hence the Trojans draw;
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Till neither fires nor shining shores they saw.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Now seas and skies their prospect only bound;
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>An empty space above, a floating field around.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>But soon the heav'ns with shadows were o'erspread;
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>A swelling cloud hung hov'ring o'er their head:
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Livid it look'd, the threat'ning of a storm:
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Then night and horror ocean's face deform.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>The pilot, Palinurus, cried aloud:
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>"What gusts of weather from that gath'ring cloud
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>My thoughts presage! Ere yet the tempest roars,
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Stand to your tackle, mates, and stretch your oars;
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Contract your swelling sails, and luff to wind."
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>The frighted crew perform the task assign'd.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Then, to his fearless chief: "Not Heav'n," said 
<A NAME="34"></A>he,
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>"Tho' Jove himself should promise Italy,
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>Can stem the torrent of this raging sea.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Mark how the shifting winds from west arise,
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>And what collected night involves the skies!
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Nor can our shaken vessels live at sea,
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Much less against the tempest force their way.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>'T is fate diverts our course, and fate we must 
<A NAME="42"></A>obey.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Not far from hence, if I observ'd aright
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>The southing of the stars, and polar light,
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Sicilia lies, whose hospitable shores
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>In safety we may reach with struggling oars."
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>Aeneas then replied: "Too sure I find
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>We strive in vain against the seas and wind:
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>Now shift your sails; what place can please me more
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Than what you promise, the Sicilian shore,
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Whose hallow'd earth Anchises' bones contains,
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>And where a prince of Trojan lineage reigns?"
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>The course resolv'd, before the western wind
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>They scud amain, and make the port assign'd.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Meantime Acestes, from a lofty stand,
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Beheld the fleet descending on the land;
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>And, not unmindful of his ancient race,
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Down from the cliff he ran with eager pace,
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>And held the hero in a strict embrace.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Of a rough Libyan bear the spoils he wore,
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>And either hand a pointed jav'lin bore.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>His mother was a dame of Dardan blood;
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>His sire Crinisus, a Sicilian flood.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>He welcomes his returning friends ashore
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>With plenteous country cates and homely store.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Now, when the following morn had chas'd away
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>The flying stars, and light restor'd the day,
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Aeneas call'd the Trojan troops around,
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>And thus bespoke them from a rising ground:
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>"Offspring of heav'n, divine Dardanian race!
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>The sun, revolving thro' th' ethereal space,
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>The shining circle of the year has fill'd,
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Since first this isle my father's ashes held:
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>And now the rising day renews the year;
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>A day for ever sad, for ever dear.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>This would I celebrate with annual games,
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>With gifts on altars pil'd, and holy flames,
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Tho' banish'd to Gaetulia's barren sands,
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Caught on the Grecian seas, or hostile lands:
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>But since this happy storm our fleet has driv'n
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>(Not, as I deem, without the will of Heav'n)
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Upon these friendly shores and flow'ry plains,
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Which hide Anchises and his blest remains,
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Let us with joy perform his honors due,
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>And pray for prosp'rous winds, our voyage to renew;
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Pray, that in towns and temples of our own,
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>The name of great Anchises may be known,
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>And yearly games may spread the gods' renown.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Our sports Acestes, of the Trojan race,
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>With royal gifts ordain'd, is pleas'd to grace:
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Two steers on ev'ry ship the king bestows;
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>His gods and ours shall share your equal vows.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Besides, if, nine days hence, the rosy morn
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>Shall with unclouded light the skies adorn,
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>That day with solemn sports I mean to grace:
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>Light galleys on the seas shall run a wat'ry race;
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Some shall in swiftness for the goal contend,
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>And others try the twanging bow to bend;
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>The strong, with iron gauntlets arm'd, shall stand
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Oppos'd in combat on the yellow sand.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Let all be present at the games prepar'd,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>And joyful victors wait the just reward.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>But now assist the rites, with garlands crown'd."
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>He said, and first his brows with myrtle bound.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Then Helymus, by his example led,
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>And old Acestes, each adorn'd his head;
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Thus young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace,
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>His temples tied, and all the Trojan race.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Aeneas then advanc'd amidst the train,
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>By thousands follow'd thro' the flow'ry plain,
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>To great Anchises' tomb; which when he found,
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>He pour'd to Bacchus, on the hallow'd ground,
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Two bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more,
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>And two (from offer'd bulls) of purple gore,
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>With roses then the sepulcher he strow'd
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>And thus his father's ghost bespoke aloud:
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>"Hail, O ye holy manes! hail again,
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Paternal ashes, now review'd in vain!
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>The gods permitted not, that you, with me,
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Should reach the promis'd shores of Italy,
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Or Tiber's flood, what flood soe'er it be."
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Scarce had he finish'd, when, with speckled pride,
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>A serpent from the tomb began to glide;
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>His hugy bulk on sev'n high volumes roll'd;
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Blue was his breadth of back, but streak'd with scaly 
<A NAME="126"></A>gold:
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Thus riding on his curls, he seem'd to pass
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>A rolling fire along, and singe the grass.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>More various colors thro' his body run,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Than Iris when her bow imbibes the sun.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Betwixt the rising altars, and around,
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>The sacred monster shot along the ground;
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>With harmless play amidst the bowls he pass'd,
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>And with his lolling tongue assay'd the taste:
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Thus fed with holy food, the wondrous guest
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Within the hollow tomb retir'd to rest.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>The pious prince, surpris'd at what he view'd,
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>The fun'ral honors with more zeal renew'd,
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>Doubtful if this place's genius were,
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>Or guardian of his father's sepulcher.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Five sheep, according to the rites, he slew;
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>As many swine, and steers of sable hue;
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>New gen'rous wine he from the goblets pour'd.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>And call'd his father's ghost, from hell restor'd.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>The glad attendants in long order come,
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>Off'ring their gifts at great Anchises' tomb:
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Some add more oxen: some divide the spoil;
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Some place the chargers on the grassy soil;
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Some blow the fires, and off entrails broil.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Now came the day desir'd. The skies were bright
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>With rosy luster of the rising light:
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>The bord'ring people, rous'd by sounding fame
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Of Trojan feasts and great Acestes' name,
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>The crowded shore with acclamations fill,
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Part to behold, and part to prove their skill.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>And first the gifts in public view they place,
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>Green laurel wreaths, and palm, the victors' grace:
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Within the circle, arms and tripods lie,
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Ingots of gold and silver, heap'd on high,
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>And vests embroider'd, of the Tyrian dye.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>The trumpet's clangor then the feast proclaims,
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>And all prepare for their appointed games.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Four galleys first, which equal rowers bear,
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Advancing, in the wat'ry lists appear.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>The speedy Dolphin, that outstrips the wind,
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Bore Mnestheus, author of the Memmian kind:
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>Gyas the vast Chimaera's bulk commands,
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>Which rising, like a tow'ring city stands;
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Three Trojans tug at ev'ry lab'ring oar;
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Three banks in three degrees the sailors bore;
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Beneath their sturdy strokes the billows roar.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Sergesthus, who began the Sergian race,
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>In the great Centaur took the leading place;
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>Cloanthus on the sea-green Scylla stood,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>From whom Cluentius draws his Trojan blood.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Far in the sea, against the foaming shore,
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>There stands a rock: the raging billows roar
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>Above his head in storms; but, when 't is clear,
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>Uncurl their ridgy backs, and at his foot appear.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>In peace below the gentle waters run;
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>The cormorants above lie basking in the sun.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>On this the hero fix'd an oak in sight,
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>The mark to guide the mariners aright.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>To bear with this, the seamen stretch their oars;
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Then round the rock they steer, and seek the former 
<A NAME="186"></A>shores.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>The lots decide their place. Above the rest,
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Each leader shining in his Tyrian vest;
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>The common crew with wreaths of poplar boughs
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Their temples crown, and shade their sweaty brows:
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Besmear'd with oil, their naked shoulders shine.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>All take their seats, and wait the sounding sign:
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>They gripe their oars; and ev'ry panting breast
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Is rais'd by turns with hope, by turns with fear 
<A NAME="195"></A>depress'd.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>The clangor of the trumpet gives the sign;
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>At once they start, advancing in a line:
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>With shouts the sailors rend the starry skies;
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Lash'd with their oars, the smoky billows rise;
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Sparkles the briny main, and the vex'd ocean fries.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Exact in time, with equal strokes they row:
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>At once the brushing oars and brazen prow
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Dash up the sandy waves, and ope the depths below.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Not fiery coursers, in a chariot race,
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Invade the field with half so swift a pace;
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Not the fierce driver with more fury lends
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>The sounding lash, and, ere the stroke descends,
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Low to the wheels his pliant body bends.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>The partial crowd their hopes and fears divide,
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>And aid with eager shouts the favor'd side.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Cries, murmurs, clamors, with a mixing sound,
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>From woods to woods, from hills to hills rebound.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Amidst the loud applauses of the shore,
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Gyas outstripp'd the rest, and sprung before:
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Cloanthus, better mann'd, pursued him fast,
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>But his o'er-masted galley check'd his haste.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>The Centaur and the Dolphin brush the brine
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>With equal oars, advancing in a line;
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>And now the mighty Centaur seems to lead,
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>And now the speedy Dolphin gets ahead;
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Now board to board the rival vessels row,
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>The billows lave the skies, and ocean groans below.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>They reach'd the mark. Proud Gyas and his train
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>In triumph rode, the victors of the main;
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>But, steering round, he charg'd his pilot stand
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>More close to shore, and skim along the sand-
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>"Let others bear to sea!" Menoetes heard;
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>But secret shelves too cautiously he fear'd,
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>And, fearing, sought the deep; and still aloof he 
<A NAME="230"></A>steer'd.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>With louder cries the captain call'd again:
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>"Bear to the rocky shore, and shun the main."
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>He spoke, and, speaking, at his stern he saw
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>The bold Cloanthus near the shelvings draw.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Betwixt the mark and him the Scylla stood,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>And in a closer compass plow'd the flood.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>He pass'd the mark; and, wheeling, got before:
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Gyas blasphem'd the gods, devoutly swore,
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Cried out for anger, and his hair he tore.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Mindless of others' lives (so high was grown
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>His rising rage) and careless of his own,
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>The trembling dotard to the deck he drew;
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Then hoisted up, and overboard he threw:
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>This done, he seiz'd the helm; his fellows cheer'd,
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Turn'd short upon the shelfs, and madly steer'd.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Hardly his head the plunging pilot rears,
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Clogg'd with his clothes, and cumber'd with his 
<A NAME="248"></A>years:
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Now dropping wet, he climbs the cliff with pain.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>The crowd, that saw him fall and float again,
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Shout from the distant shore; and loudly laugh'd,
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>To see his heaving breast disgorge the briny draught.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>The following Centaur, and the Dolphin's crew,
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Their vanish'd hopes of victory renew;
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>While Gyas lags, they kindle in the race,
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>To reach the mark. Sergesthus takes the place;
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Mnestheus pursues; and while around they wind,
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Comes up, not half his galley's length behind;
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Then, on the deck, amidst his mates appear'd,
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>And thus their drooping courage he cheer'd:
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>"My friends, and Hector's followers heretofore,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Exert your vigor; tug the lab'ring oar;
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Stretch to your strokes, my still unconquer'd crew,
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Whom from the flaming walls of Troy I drew.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>In this, our common int'rest, let me find
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>That strength of hand, that courage of the mind,
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>As when you stemm'd the strong Malean flood,
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>And o'er the Syrtes' broken billows row'd.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>I seek not now the foremost palm to gain;
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Tho' yet- but, ah! that haughty wish is vain!
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Let those enjoy it whom the gods ordain.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>But to be last, the lags of all the race!-
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Redeem yourselves and me from that disgrace."
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Now, one and all, they tug amain; they row
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>At the full stretch, and shake the brazen prow.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>The sea beneath 'em sinks; their lab'ring sides
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Are swell'd, and sweat runs gutt'ring down in tides.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>Chance aids their daring with unhop'd success;
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>Sergesthus, eager with his beak to press
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Betwixt the rival galley and the rock,
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Shuts up th' unwieldly Centaur in the lock.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>The vessel struck; and, with the dreadful shock,
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Her oars she shiver'd, and her head she broke.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>The trembling rowers from their banks arise,
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>And, anxious for themselves, renounce the prize.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>With iron poles they heave her off the shores,
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>And gather from the sea their floating oars.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>The crew of Mnestheus, with elated minds,
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Urge their success, and call the willing winds;
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Then ply their oars, and cut their liquid way
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>In larger compass on the roomy sea.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>As, when the dove her rocky hold forsakes,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Rous'd in a fright, her sounding wings she shakes;
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>The cavern rings with clatt'ring; out she flies,
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>And leaves her callow care, and cleaves the skies:
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>At first she flutters; but at length she springs
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>To smoother flight, and shoots upon her wings:
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>So Mnestheus in the Dolphin cuts the sea;
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>And, flying with a force, that force assists his 
<A NAME="300"></A>way.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Sergesthus in the Centaur soon he pass'd,
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Wedg'd in the rocky shoals, and sticking fast.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>In vain the victor he with cries implores,
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>And practices to row with shatter'd oars.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Then Mnestheus bears with Gyas, and outflies:
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>The ship, without a pilot, yields the prize.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Unvanquish'd Scylla now alone remains;
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>Her he pursues, and all his vigor strains.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Shouts from the fav'ring multitude arise;
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Applauding Echo to the shouts replies;
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Shouts, wishes, and applause run rattling thro' the 
<A NAME="312"></A>skies.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>These clamors with disdain the Scylla heard,
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Much grudg'd the praise, but more the robb'd reward:
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>Resolv'd to hold their own, they mend their pace,
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>All obstinate to die, or gain the race.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Rais'd with success, the Dolphin swiftly ran;
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>For they can conquer, who believe they can.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Both urge their oars, and fortune both supplies,
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>And both perhaps had shar'd an equal prize;
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>When to the seas Cloanthus holds his hands,
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>And succor from the wat'ry pow'rs demands:
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>"Gods of the liquid realms, on which I row!
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>If, giv'n by you, the laurel bind my brow,
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Assist to make me guilty of my vow!
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>A snow-white bull shall on your shore be slain;
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>His offer'd entrails cast into the main,
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>And ruddy wine, from golden goblets thrown,
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Your grateful gift and my return shall own."
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>The choir of nymphs, and Phorcus, from below,
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>With virgin Panopea, heard his vow;
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>And old Portunus, with his breadth of hand,
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>Push'd on, and sped the galley to the land.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Swift as a shaft, or winged wind, she flies,
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>And, darting to the port, obtains the prize.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>The herald summons all, and then proclaims
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Cloanthus conqu'ror of the naval games.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>The prince with laurel crowns the victor's head,
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>And three fat steers are to his vessel led,
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>The ship's reward; with gen'rous wine beside,
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>And sums of silver, which the crew divide.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>The leaders are distinguish'd from the rest;
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>The victor honor'd with a nobler vest,
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Where gold and purple strive in equal rows,
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>And needlework its happy cost bestows.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>There Ganymede is wrought with living art,
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>Chasing thro' Ida's groves the trembling hart:
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Breathless he seems, yet eager to pursue;
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>When from aloft descends, in open view,
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>The bird of Jove, and, sousing on his prey,
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>With crooked talons bears the boy away.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>In vain, with lifted hands and gazing eyes,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>His guards behold him soaring thro' the skies,
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>And dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries.
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Mnestheus the second victor was declar'd;
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>And, summon'd there, the second prize he shard.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>A coat of mail, brave Demoleus bore,
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>More brave Aeneas from his shoulders tore,
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>In single combat on the Trojan shore:
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>This was ordain'd for Mnestheus to possess;
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>In war for his defense, for ornament in peace.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Rich was the gift, and glorious to behold,
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>But yet so pond'rous with its plates of gold,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>That scarce two servants could the weight sustain;
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Yet, loaded thus, Demoleus o'er the plain
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Pursued and lightly seiz'd the Trojan train.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>The third, succeeding to the last reward,
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Two goodly bowls of massy silver shar'd,
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>With figures prominent, and richly wrought,
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>And two brass caldrons from Dodona brought.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Thus all, rewarded by the hero's hands,
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>Their conqu'ring temples bound with purple bands;
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>And now Sergesthus, clearing from the rock,
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Brought back his galley shatter'd with the shock.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>Forlorn she look'd, without an aiding oar,
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>And, houted by the vulgar, made to shore.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>As when a snake, surpris'd upon the road,
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Is crush'd athwart her body by the load
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Of heavy wheels; or with a mortal wound
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Her belly bruis'd, and trodden to the ground:
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>In vain, with loosen'd curls, she crawls along;
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Yet, fierce above, she brandishes her tongue;
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Glares with her eyes, and bristles with her scales;
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>But, groveling in the dust, her parts unsound she 
<A NAME="385"></A>trails:
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>So slowly to the port the Centaur tends,
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>But, what she wants in oars, with sails amends.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Yet, for his galley sav'd, the grateful prince
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>Is pleas'd th' unhappy chief to recompense.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Pholoe, the Cretan slave, rewards his care,
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>Beauteous herself, with lovely twins as fair.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>From thence his way the Trojan hero bent
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Into the neighb'ring plain, with mountains pent,
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>Whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Full in the midst of this fair valley stood
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>A native theater, which, rising slow
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>By just degrees, o'erlook'd the ground below.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>High on a sylvan throne the leader sate;
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>A num'rous train attend in solemn state.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Here those that in the rapid course delight,
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Desire of honor and the prize invite.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>The rival runners without order stand;
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>The Trojans mix'd with the Sicilian band.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>First Nisus, with Euryalus, appears;
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>Euryalus a boy of blooming years,
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>With sprightly grace and equal beauty crown'd;
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Nisus, for friendship to the youth renown'd.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Diores next, of Priam's royal race,
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Then Salius joined with Patron, took their place;
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>(But Patron in Arcadia had his birth,
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>And Salius his from Arcananian earth;)
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Then two Sicilian youths- the names of these,
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Swift Helymus, and lovely Panopes:
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Both jolly huntsmen, both in forest bred,
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>And owning old Acestes for their head;
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>With sev'ral others of ignobler name,
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Whom time has not deliver'd o'er to fame.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>To these the hero thus his thoughts explain'd,
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>In words which gen'ral approbation gain'd:
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>"One common largess is for all design'd,
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>(The vanquish'd and the victor shall be join'd,)
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Two darts of polish'd steel and Gnosian wood,
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>A silver-studded ax, alike bestow'd.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>The foremost three have olive wreaths decreed:
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>The first of these obtains a stately steed,
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Adorn'd with trappings; and the next in fame,
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>The quiver of an Amazonian dame,
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>With feather'd Thracian arrows well supplied:
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>A golden belt shall gird his manly side,
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>The third this Grecian helmet shall content."
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>He said. To their appointed base they went;
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>With beating hearts th' expected sign receive,
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>And, starting all at once, the barrier leave.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Spread out, as on the winged winds, they flew,
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>And seiz'd the distant goal with greedy view.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Shot from the crowd, swift Nisus all o'erpass'd;
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Nor storms, nor thunder, equal half his haste.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>The next, but tho' the next, yet far disjoin'd,
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Came Salius, and Euryalus behind;
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Then Helymus, whom young Diores plied,
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>Step after step, and almost side by side,
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>His shoulders pressing; and, in longer space,
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Had won, or left at least a dubious race.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Now, spent, the goal they almost reach at last,
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>When eager Nisus, hapless in his haste,
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Slipp'd first, and, slipping, fell upon the plain,
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Soak'd with the blood of oxen newly slain.
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>The careless victor had not mark'd his way;
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>But, treading where the treach'rous puddle lay,
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>His heels flew up; and on the grassy floor
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>He fell, besmear'd with filth and holy gore.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Not mindless then, Euryalus, of thee,
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Nor of the sacred bonds of amity,
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>He strove th' immediate rival's hope to cross,
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>And caught the foot of Salius as he rose.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>So Salius lay extended on the plain;
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Euryalus springs out, the prize to gain,
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>And leaves the crowd: applauding peals attend
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>The victor to the goal, who vanquish'd by his friend.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Next Helymus; and then Diores came,
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>By two misfortunes made the third in fame.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>But Salius enters, and, exclaiming loud
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>For justice, deafens and disturbs the crowd;
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Urges his cause may in the court be heard;
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>And pleads the prize is wrongfully conferr'd.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>But favor for Euryalus appears;
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>His blooming beauty, with his tender tears,
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Had brib'd the judges for the promis'd prize.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>Besides, Diores fills the court with cries,
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Who vainly reaches at the last reward,
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>If the first palm on Salius be conferr'd.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Then thus the prince: "Let no disputes arise:
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Where fortune plac'd it, I award the prize.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>But fortune's errors give me leave to mend,
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>At least to pity my deserving friend."
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>He said, and, from among the spoils, he draws
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>(Pond'rous with shaggy mane and golden paws)
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>A lion's hide: to Salius this he gives.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Nisus with envy sees the gift, and grieves.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>"If such rewards to vanquish'd men are due."
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>He said, "and falling is to rise by you,
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>What prize may Nisus from your bounty claim,
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Who merited the first rewards and fame?
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>In falling, both an equal fortune tried;
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Would fortune for my fall so well provide!"
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>With this he pointed to his face, and show'd
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>His hand and all his habit smear'd with blood.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Th' indulgent father of the people smil'd,
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>And caus'd to be produc'd an ample shield,
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>Of wondrous art, by Didymaon wrought,
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>Long since from Neptune's bars in triumph brought.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>This giv'n to Nisus, he divides the rest,
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>And equal justice in his gifts express'd.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>The race thus ended, and rewards bestow'd,
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Once more the princes bespeaks th' attentive crowd:
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>"If there he here whose dauntless courage dare
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>In gauntlet-fight, with limbs and body bare,
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>His opposite sustain in open view,
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Stand forth the champion, and the games renew.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Two prizes I propose, and thus divide:
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>A bull with gilded horns, and fillets tied,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>Shall be the portion of the conqu'ring chief;
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>A sword and helm shall cheer the loser's grief."
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Then haughty Dares in the lists appears;
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Stalking he strides, his head erected bears:
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield,
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>And loud applauses echo thro' the field.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Dares alone in combat us'd to stand
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>The match of mighty Paris, hand to hand;
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>The same, at Hector's fun'rals, undertook
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Gigantic Butes, of th' Amycian stock,
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>And, by the stroke of his resistless hand,
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Stretch'd the vast bulk upon the yellow sand.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Such Dares was; and such he strode along,
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>And drew the wonder of the gazing throng.
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>His brawny back and ample breast he shows,
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>His lifted arms around his head he throws,
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>And deals in whistling air his empty blows.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>His match is sought; but, thro' the trembling band,
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Not one dares answer to the proud demand.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>Presuming of his force, with sparkling eyes
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Already he devours the promis'd prize.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>He claims the bull with awless insolence,
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>And having seiz'd his horns, accosts the prince:
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>"If none my matchless valor dares oppose,
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>How long shall Dares wait his dastard foes?
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Permit me, chief, permit without delay,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>To lead this uncontended gift away."
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>The crowd assents, and with redoubled cries
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>For the proud challenger demands the prize.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Acestes, fir'd with just disdain, to see
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>The palm usurp'd without a victory,
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>Reproach'd Entellus thus, who sate beside,
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>And heard and saw, unmov'd, the Trojan's pride:
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>"Once, but in vain, a champion of renown,
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>So tamely can you bear the ravish'd crown,
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>A prize in triumph borne before your sight,
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>And shun, for fear, the danger of the fight?
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Where is our Eryx now, the boasted name,
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>The god who taught your thund'ring arm the game?
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Where now your baffled honor? Where the spoil
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>That fill'd your house, and fame that fill'd our 
<A NAME="544"></A>isle?"
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Entellus, thus: "My soul is still the same,
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Unmov'd with fear, and mov'd with martial fame;
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>But my chill blood is curdled in my veins,
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>And scarce the shadow of a man remains.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>O could I turn to that fair prime again,
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>That prime of which this boaster is so vain,
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>The brave, who this decrepid age defies,
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Should feel my force, without the promis'd prize."
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>He said; and, rising at the word, he threw
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Two pond'rous gauntlets down in open view;
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Gauntlets which Eryx wont in fight to wield,
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>And sheathe his hands with in the listed field.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>With fear and wonder seiz'd, the crowd beholds
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>The gloves of death, with sev'n distinguish'd folds
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>Of tough bull hides; the space within is spread
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>With iron, or with loads of heavy lead:
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Dares himself was daunted at the sight,
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Renounc'd his challenge, and refus'd to fight.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>Astonish'd at their weight, the hero stands,
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>And pois'd the pond'rous engines in his hands.
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>"What had your wonder," said Entellus, "been,
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Had you the gauntlets of Alcides seen,
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Or view'd the stern debate on this unhappy green!
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>These which I bear your brother Eryx bore,
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Still mark'd with batter'd brains and mingled gore.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>With these he long sustain'd th' Herculean arm;
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>And these I wielded while my blood was warm,
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>This languish'd frame while better spirits fed,
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Ere age unstrung my nerves, or time o'ersnow'd my 
<A NAME="574"></A>head.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>But if the challenger these arms refuse,
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>And cannot wield their weight, or dare not use;
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>If great Aeneas and Acestes join
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>In his request, these gauntlets I resign;
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Let us with equal arms perform the fight,
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>And let him leave to fear, since I resign my right."
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>This said, Entellus for the strife prepares;
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Stripp'd of his quilted coat, his body bares;
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Compos'd of mighty bones and brawn he stands,
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>A goodly tow'ring object on the sands.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Then just Aeneas equal arms supplied,
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Which round their shoulders to their wrists they 
<A NAME="587"></A>tied.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Both on the tiptoe stand, at full extent,
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>Their arms aloft, their bodies inly bent;
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>Their heads from aiming blows they bear afar;
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>With clashing gauntlets then provoke the war.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>One on his youth and pliant limbs relies;
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>One on his sinews and his giant size.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>The last is stiff with age, his motion slow;
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>He heaves for breath, he staggers to and fro,
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>And clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly 
<A NAME="597"></A>blow.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Yet equal in success, they ward, they strike;
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>Their ways are diff'rent, but their art alike.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Before, behind, the blows are dealt; around
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>Their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>A storm of strokes, well meant, with fury flies,
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>And errs about their temples, ears, and eyes.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Nor always errs; for oft the gauntlet draws
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>A sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Heavy with age, Entellus stands his ground,
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>But with his warping body wards the wound.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>His hand and watchful eye keep even pace;
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>While Dares traverses and shifts his place,
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>And, like a captain who beleaguers round
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Some strong-built castle on a rising ground,
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Views all th' approaches with observing eyes:
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>This and that other part in vain he tries,
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>And more on industry than force relies.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>With hands on high, Entellus threats the foe;
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>But Dares watch'd the motion from below,
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>And slipp'd aside, and shunn'd the long descending 
<A NAME="618"></A>blow.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>Entellus wastes his forces on the wind,
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>And, thus deluded of the stroke design'd,
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Headlong and heavy fell; his ample breast
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>And weighty limbs his ancient mother press'd.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>So falls a hollow pine, that long had stood
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>On Ida's height, or Erymanthus' wood,
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>Torn from the roots. The diff'ring nations rise,
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>And shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies,
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Acestus runs with eager haste, to raise
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>The fall'n companion of his youthful days.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Dauntless he rose, and to the fight return'd;
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>With shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury 
<A NAME="631"></A>burn'd.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>Disdain and conscious virtue fir'd his breast,
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>And with redoubled force his foe he press'd.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>He lays on load with either hand, amain,
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>And headlong drives the Trojan o'er the plain;
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Nor stops, nor stays; nor rest nor breath allows;
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>But storms of strokes descend about his brows,
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>A rattling tempest, and a hail of blows.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>But now the prince, who saw the wild increase
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Of wounds, commands the combatants to cease,
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>And bounds Entellus' wrath, and bids the peace.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>First to the Trojan, spent with toil, he came,
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>And sooth'd his sorrow for the suffer'd shame.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>"What fury seiz'd my friend? The gods," said he,
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>"To him propitious, and averse to thee,
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Have giv'n his arm superior force to thine.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>'T is madness to contend with strength divine."
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>The gauntlet fight thus ended, from the shore
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>His faithful friends unhappy Dares bore:
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>His mouth and nostrils pour'd a purple flood,
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Faintly he stagger'd thro' the hissing throng,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>And hung his head, and trail'd his legs along.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>The sword and casque are carried by his train;
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>But with his foe the palm and ox remain.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>The champion, then, before Aeneas came,
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>Proud of his prize, but prouder of his fame:
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>"O goddess-born, and you, Dardanian host,
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Mark with attention, and forgive my boast;
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>Learn what I was, by what remains; and know
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>From what impending fate you sav'd my foe."
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>Sternly he spoke, and then confronts the bull;
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>And, on his ample forehead aiming full,
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>The deadly stroke, descending, pierc'd the skull.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Down drops the beast, nor needs a second wound,
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>But sprawls in pangs of death, and spurns the ground.
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Then, thus: "In Dares' stead I offer this.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>Eryx, accept a nobler sacrifice;
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>Take the last gift my wither'd arms can yield:
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Thy gauntlets I resign, and here renounce the field."
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>This done, Aeneas orders, for the close,
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>The strife of archers with contending bows.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>The mast Sergesthus' shatter'd galley bore
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>With his own hands he raises on the shore.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>A flutt'ring dove upon the top they tie,
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>The living mark at which their arrows fly.
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>The rival archers in a line advance,
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Their turn of shooting to receive from chance.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>A helmet holds their names; the lots are drawn:
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>On the first scroll was read Hippocoon.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>The people shout. Upon the next was found
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Young Mnestheus, late with naval honors crown'd.
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>The third contain'd Eurytion's noble name,
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Thy brother, Pandarus, and next in fame,
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>Whom Pallas urg'd the treaty to confound,
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>And send among the Greeks a feather'd wound.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>Acestes in the bottom last remain'd,
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>Whom not his age from youthful sports restrain'd.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>Soon all with vigor bend their trusty bows,
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>And from the quiver each his arrow chose.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Hippocoon's was the first: with forceful sway
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>It flew, and, whizzing, cut the liquid way.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>Fix'd in the mast the feather'd weapon stands:
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>The fearful pigeon flutters in her bands,
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>And the tree trembled, and the shouting cries
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Of the pleas'd people rend the vaulted skies.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Then Mnestheus to the head his arrow drove,
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>With lifted eyes, and took his aim above,
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>But made a glancing shot, and missed the dove;
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>Yet miss'd so narrow, that he cut the cord
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>Which fasten'd by the foot the flitting bird.
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>The captive thus releas'd, away she flies,
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>And beats with clapping wings the yielding skies.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>His bow already bent, Eurytion stood;
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>And, having first invok'd his brother god,
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>His winged shaft with eager haste he sped.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>The fatal message reach'd her as she fled:
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>She leaves her life aloft; she strikes the ground,
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>And renders back the weapon in the wound.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>Acestes, grudging at his lot, remains,
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>Without a prize to gratify his pains.
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>Yet, shooting upward, sends his shaft, to show
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>An archer's art, and boast his twanging bow.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>The feather'd arrow gave a dire portent,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>And latter augurs judge from this event.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>Chaf'd by the speed, it fir'd; and, as it flew,
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>A trail of following flames ascending drew:
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Kindling they mount, and mark the shiny way;
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>Across the skies as falling meteors play,
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>And vanish into wind, or in a blaze decay.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>The Trojans and Sicilians wildly stare,
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>And, trembling, turn their wonder into pray'r.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>The Dardan prince put on a smiling face,
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>And strain'd Acestes with a close embrace;
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>Then, hon'ring him with gifts above the rest,
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Turn'd the bad omen, nor his fears confess'd.
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>"The gods," said he, "this miracle have wrought,
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>And order'd you the prize without the lot.
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>Accept this goblet, rough with figur'd gold,
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Which Thracian Cisseus gave my sire of old:
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>This pledge of ancient amity receive,
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Which to my second sire I justly give."
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>He said, and, with the trumpets' cheerful sound,
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>Proclaim'd him victor, and with laurel-crown'd.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Nor good Eurytion envied him the prize,
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>Tho' he transfix'd the pigeon in the skies.
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>Who cut the line, with second gifts was grac'd;
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>The third was his whose arrow pierc'd the mast.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>The chief, before the games were wholly done,
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>Call'd Periphantes, tutor to his son,
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>And whisper'd thus: "With speed Ascanius find;
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>And, if his childish troop be ready join'd,
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>On horseback let him grace his grandsire's day,
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>And lead his equals arm'd in just array."
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>He said; and, calling out, the cirque he clears.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>The crowd withdrawn, an open plain appears.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>And now the noble youths, of form divine,
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Advance before their fathers, in a line;
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>The riders grace the steeds; the steeds with glory 
<A NAME="750"></A>shine.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>Thus marching on in military pride,
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>Shouts of applause resound from side to side.
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Their casques adorn'd with laurel wreaths they wear,
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>Each brandishing aloft a cornel spear.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>Some at their backs their gilded quivers bore;
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>Their chains of burnish'd gold hung down before.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Three graceful troops they form'd upon the green;
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>Three graceful leaders at their head were seen;
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>Twelve follow'd ev'ry chief, and left a space between.
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>The first young Priam led; a lovely boy,
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Whose grandsire was th' unhappy king of Troy;
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>His race in after times was known to fame,
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>New honors adding to the Latian name;
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>And well the royal boy his Thracian steed became.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>White were the fetlocks of his feet before,
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>And on his front a snowy star he bore.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>Then beauteous Atys, with Iulus bred,
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>Of equal age, the second squadron led.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>The last in order, but the first in place,
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>First in the lovely features of his face,
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>Rode fair Ascanius on a fiery steed,
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>Queen Dido's gift, and of the Tyrian breed.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>Sure coursers for the rest the king ordains,
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>With golden bits adorn'd, and purple reins.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>The pleas'd spectators peals of shouts renew,
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>And all the parents in the children view;
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Their make, their motions, and their sprightly grace,
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>And hopes and fears alternate in their face.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>Th' unfledg'd commanders and their martial train
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>First make the circuit of the sandy plain
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>Around their sires, and, at th' appointed sign,
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>Drawn up in beauteous order, form a line.
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>The second signal sounds, the troop divides
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>In three distinguish'd parts, with three distinguish'd 
<A NAME="785"></A>guides
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>Again they close, and once again disjoin;
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>In troop to troop oppos'd, and line to line.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>They meet; they wheel; they throw their darts afar
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>With harmless rage and well-dissembled war.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>Then in a round the mingled bodies run:
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>Flying they follow, and pursuing shun;
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>Broken, they break; and, rallying, they renew
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>In other forms the military shew.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>At last, in order, undiscern'd they join,
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>And march together in a friendly line.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>And, as the Cretan labyrinth of old,
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>With wand'ring ways and many a winding fold,
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>Involv'd the weary feet, without redress,
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>In a round error, which denied recess;
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>So fought the Trojan boys in warlike play,
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>Turn'd and return'd, and still a diff'rent way.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Thus dolphins in the deep each other chase
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>In circles, when they swim around the wat'ry race.
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>This game, these carousels, Ascanius taught;
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>And, building Alba, to the Latins brought;
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>Shew'd what he learn'd: the Latin sires impart
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>To their succeeding sons the graceful art;
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>From these imperial Rome receiv'd the game,
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>Which Troy, the youths the Trojan troop, they name.
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>Thus far the sacred sports they celebrate:
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>But Fortune soon resum'd her ancient hate;
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>For, while they pay the dead his annual dues,
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>Those envied rites Saturnian Juno views;
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>And sends the goddess of the various bow,
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>To try new methods of revenge below;
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>Supplies the winds to wing her airy way,
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>Where in the port secure the navy lay.
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>Swiftly fair Iris down her arch descends,
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>And, undiscern'd, her fatal voyage ends.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>She saw the gath'ring crowd; and, gliding thence,
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>The desart shore, and fleet without defense.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>The Trojan matrons, on the sands alone,
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>With sighs and tears Anchises' death bemoan;
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Then, turning to the sea their weeping eyes,
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>Their pity to themselves renews their cries.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>"Alas!" said one, "what oceans yet remain
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>For us to sail! what labors to sustain!"
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>All take the word, and, with a gen'ral groan,
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>Implore the gods for peace, and places of their 
<A NAME="830"></A>own.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>The goddess, great in mischief, views their pains,
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>And in a woman's form her heav'nly limbs restrains.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>In face and shape old Beroe she became,
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>Doryclus' wife, a venerable dame,
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>Once blest with riches, and a mother's name.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>Thus chang'd, amidst the crying crowd she ran,
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>Mix'd with the matrons, and these words began:
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>"O wretched we, whom not the Grecian pow'r,
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>Nor flames, destroy'd, in Troy's unhappy hour!
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>O wretched we, reserv'd by cruel fate,
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>Beyond the ruins of the sinking state!
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>Now sev'n revolving years are wholly run,
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>Since this improsp'rous voyage we begun;
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>Since, toss'd from shores to shores, from lands to 
<A NAME="845"></A>lands,
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>Inhospitable rocks and barren sands,
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>Wand'ring in exile thro' the stormy sea,
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>We search in vain for flying Italy.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>Now cast by fortune on this kindred land,
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>What should our rest and rising walls withstand,
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>Or hinder here to fix our banish'd band?
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>O country lost, and gods redeem'd in vain,
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>If still in endless exile we remain!
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>Shall we no more the Trojan walls renew,
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>Or streams of some dissembled Simois view!
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>Haste, join with me, th' unhappy fleet consume!
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>Cassandra bids; and I declare her doom.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>In sleep I saw her; she supplied my hands
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>(For this I more than dreamt) with flaming brands:
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>'With these,' said she, 'these wand'ring ships destroy:
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>These are your fatal seats, and this your Troy.'
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>Time calls you now; the precious hour employ:
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>Slack not the good presage, while Heav'n inspires
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>Our minds to dare, and gives the ready fires.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>See! Neptune's altars minister their brands:
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>The god is pleas'd; the god supplies our hands."
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>Then from the pile a flaming fire she drew,
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>And, toss'd in air, amidst the galleys threw.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>Wrapp'd in amaze, the matrons wildly stare:
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>Then Pyrgo, reverenc'd for her hoary hair,
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>Pyrgo, the nurse of Priam's num'rous race:
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>"No Beroe this, tho' she belies her face!
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>What terrors from her frowning front arise!
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>Behold a goddess in her ardent eyes!
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>What rays around her heav'nly face are seen!
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>Mark her majestic voice, and more than mortal mien!
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>Beroe but now I left, whom, pin'd with pain,
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>Her age and anguish from these rites detain,"
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>She said. The matrons, seiz'd with new amaze,
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>Roll their malignant eyes, and on the navy gaze.
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>They fear, and hope, and neither part obey:
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>They hope the fated land, but fear the fatal way.
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>The goddess, having done her task below,
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>Mounts up on equal wings, and bends her painted 
<A NAME="885"></A>bow.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>Struck with the sight, and seiz'd with rage divine,
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>The matrons prosecute their mad design:
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>They shriek aloud; they snatch, with impious hands,
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>The food of altars; fires and flaming brands.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>Green boughs and saplings, mingled in their haste,
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>And smoking torches, on the ships they cast.
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>The flame, unstopp'd at first, more fury gains,
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>And Vulcan rides at large with loosen'd reins:
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>Triumphant to the painted sterns he soars,
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>And seizes, in this way, the banks and crackling 
<A NAME="896"></A>oars.
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>Eumelus was the first the news to bear,
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>While yet they crowd the rural theater.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>Then, what they hear, is witness'd by their eyes:
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>A storm of sparkles and of flames arise.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>Ascanius took th' alarm, while yet he led
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>His early warriors on his prancing steed,
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>And, spurring on, his equals soon o'erpass'd;
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>Nor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>Soon as the royal youth appear'd in view,
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>He sent his voice before him as he flew:
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>"What madness moves you, matrons, to destroy
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>The last remainders of unhappy Troy!
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>Not hostile fleets, but your own hopes, you burn,
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>And on your friends your fatal fury turn.
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>Behold your own Ascanius!" While he said,
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>He drew his glitt'ring helmet from his head,
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>In which the youths to sportful arms he led.
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>By this, Aeneas and his train appear;
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>And now the women, seiz'd with shame and fear,
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>Dispers'd, to woods and caverns take their flight,
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>Abhor their actions, and avoid the light;
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>Their friends acknowledge, and their error find,
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>And shake the goddess from their alter'd mind.
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>Not so the raging fires their fury cease,
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>But, lurking in the seams, with seeming peace,
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>Work on their way amid the smold'ring tow,
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>Sure in destruction, but in motion slow.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>The silent plague thro' the green timber eats,
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>And vomits out a tardy flame by fits.
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>Down to the keels, and upward to the sails,
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>The fire descends, or mounts, but still prevails;
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>Nor buckets pour'd, nor strength of human hand,
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>Can the victorious element withstand.
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>The pious hero rends his robe, and throws
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>To heav'n his hands, and with his hands his vows.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>"O Jove," he cried, "if pray'rs can yet have place;
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>If thou abhorr'st not all the Dardan race;
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>If any spark of pity still remain;
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>If gods are gods, and not invok'd in vain;
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>Yet spare the relics of the Trojan train!
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>Yet from the flames our burning vessels free,
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>Or let thy fury fall alone on me!
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>At this devoted head thy thunder throw,
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>And send the willing sacrifice below!"
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>Scarce had he said, when southern storms arise:
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>From pole to pole the forky lightning flies;
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>Loud rattling shakes the mountains and the plain;
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>Heav'n bellies downward, and descends in rain.
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>Whole sheets of water from the clouds are sent,
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>Which, hissing thro' the planks, the flames prevent,
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>And stop the fiery pest. Four ships alone
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>Burn to the waist, and for the fleet atone.
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>But doubtful thoughts the hero's heart divide;
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>If he should still in Sicily reside,
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>Forgetful of his fates, or tempt the main,
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>In hope the promis'd Italy to gain.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>Then Nautes, old and wise, to whom alone
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>The will of Heav'n by Pallas was foreshown;
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>Vers'd in portents, experienc'd, and inspir'd
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>To tell events, and what the fates requir'd;
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>Thus while he stood, to neither part inclin'd,
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>With cheerful words reliev'd his lab'ring mind:
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>"O goddess-born, resign'd in ev'ry state,
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>With patience bear, with prudence push your fate.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>By suff'ring well, our Fortune we subdue;
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>Fly when she frowns, and, when she calls, pursue.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>Your friend Acestes is of Trojan kind;
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>To him disclose the secrets of your mind:
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>Trust in his hands your old and useless train;
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>Too num'rous for the ships which yet remain:
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>The feeble, old, indulgent of their ease,
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>The dames who dread the dangers of the seas,
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>With all the dastard crew, who dare not stand
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>The shock of battle with your foes by land.
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>Here you may build a common town for all,
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>And, from Acestes' name, Acesta call."
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>The reasons, with his friend's experience join'd,
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>Encourag'd much, but more disturb'd his mind.
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>'T was dead of night; when to his slumb'ring eyes
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>His father's shade descended from the skies,
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>And thus he spoke: "O more than vital breath,
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>Lov'd while I liv'd, and dear ev'n after death;
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>O son, in various toils and troubles toss'd,
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>The King of Heav'n employs my careful ghost
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>On his commands: the god, who sav'd from fire
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>Your flaming fleet, and heard your just desire.
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>The wholesome counsel of your friend receive,
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>And here the coward train and woman leave:
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>The chosen youth, and those who nobly dare,
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>Transport, to tempt the dangers of the war.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>The stern Italians will their courage try;
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>Rough are their manners, and their minds are high.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>But first to Pluto's palace you shall go,
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>And seek my shade among the blest below:
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>For not with impious ghosts my soul remains,
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>Nor suffers with the damn'd perpetual pains,
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>But breathes the living air of soft Elysian plains.
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>The chaste Sibylla shall your steps convey,
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>And blood of offer'd victims free the way.
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>There shall you know what realms the gods assign,
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>And learn the fates and fortunes of your line.
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>But now, farewell! I vanish with the night,
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>And feel the blast of heav'n's approaching light."
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>He said, and mix'd with shades, and took his airy 
<A NAME="1001"></A>flight.
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>"Whither so fast?" the filial duty cried;
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>"And why, ah why, the wish'd embrace denied?"
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>He said, and rose; as holy zeal inspires,
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>He rakes hot embers, and renews the fires;
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>His country gods and Vesta then adores
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>With cakes and incense, and their aid implores.
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>Next, for his friends and royal host he sent,
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>Reveal'd his vision, and the gods' intent,
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>With his own purpose. All, without delay,
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>The will of Jove, and his desires obey.
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>They list with women each degenerate name,
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>Who dares not hazard life for future fame.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>These they cashier: the brave remaining few,
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>Oars, banks, and cables, half consum'd, renew.
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>The prince designs a city with the plow;
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>The lots their sev'ral tenements allow.
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>This part is nam'd from Ilium, that from Troy,
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>And the new king ascends the throne with joy;
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>A chosen senate from the people draws;
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>Appoints the judges, and ordains the laws.
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>Then, on the top of Eryx, they begin
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>A rising temple to the Paphian queen.
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>Anchises, last, is honor'd as a god;
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>A priest is added, annual gifts bestow'd,
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>And groves are planted round his blest abode.
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>Nine days they pass in feasts, their temples crown'd;
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>And fumes of incense in the fanes abound.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>Then from the south arose a gentle breeze
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>That curl'd the smoothness of the glassy seas;
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>The rising winds a ruffling gale afford,
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>And call the merry mariners aboard.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>Now loud laments along the shores resound,
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>Of parting friends in close embraces bound.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>The trembling women, the degenerate train,
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>Who shunn'd the frightful dangers of the main,
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>Ev'n those desire to sail, and take their share
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>Of the rough passage and the promis'd war:
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>Whom good Aeneas cheers, and recommends
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>To their new master's care his fearful friends.
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>On Eryx's altars three fat calves he lays;
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>A lamb new-fallen to the stormy seas;
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>Then slips his haulsers, and his anchors weighs.
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>High on the deck the godlike hero stands,
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>With olive crown'd, a charger in his hands;
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>Then cast the reeking entrails in the brine,
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>And pour'd the sacrifice of purple wine.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>Fresh gales arise; with equal strokes they vie,
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>And brush the buxom seas, and o'er the billows fly.
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>Meantime the mother goddess, full of fears,
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>To Neptune thus address'd, with tender tears:
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>"The pride of Jove's imperious queen, the rage,
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>The malice which no suff'rings can assuage,
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>Compel me to these pray'rs; since neither fate,
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>Nor time, nor pity, can remove her hate:
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>Ev'n Jove is thwarted by his haughty wife;
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>Still vanquish'd, yet she still renews the strife.
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>As if 't were little to consume the town
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>Which aw'd the world, and wore th' imperial crown,
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>She prosecutes the ghost of Troy with pains,
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>And gnaws, ev'n to the bones, the last remains.
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>Let her the causes of her hatred tell;
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>But you can witness its effects too well.
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>You saw the storm she rais'd on Libyan floods,
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>That mix'd the mounting billows with the clouds;
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>When, bribing Aeolus, she shook the main,
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>And mov'd rebellion in your wat'ry reign.
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>With fury she possess'd the Dardan dames,
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>To burn their fleet with execrable flames,
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>And forc'd Aeneas, when his ships were lost,
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>To leave his foll'wers on a foreign coast.
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>For what remains, your godhead I implore,
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>And trust my son to your protecting pow'r.
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>If neither Jove's nor Fate's decree withstand,
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>Secure his passage to the Latian land."
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>Then thus the mighty Ruler of the Main:
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>"What may not Venus hope from Neptune's reign?
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>My kingdom claims your birth; my late defense
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>Of your indanger'd fleet may claim your confidence.
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>Nor less by land than sea my deeds declare
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>How much your lov'd Aeneas is my care.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>Thee, Xanthus, and thee, Simois, I attest.
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>Your Trojan troops when proud Achilles press'd,
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>And drove before him headlong on the plain,
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>And dash'd against the walls the trembling train;
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>When floods were fill'd with bodies of the slain;
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>When crimson Xanthus, doubtful of his way,
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>Stood up on ridges to behold the sea;
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>(New heaps came tumbling in, and chok'd his way;)
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>When your Aeneas fought, but fought with odds
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>Of force unequal, and unequal gods;
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>I spread a cloud before the victor's sight,
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>Sustain'd the vanquish'd, and secur'd his flight;
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>Ev'n then secur'd him, when I sought with joy
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>The vow'd destruction of ungrateful Troy.
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>My will's the same: fair goddess, fear no more,
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>Your fleet shall safely gain the Latian shore;
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>Their lives are giv'n; one destin'd head alone
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>Shall perish, and for multitudes atone."
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>Thus having arm'd with hopes her anxious mind,
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>His finny team Saturnian Neptune join'd,
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>Then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws,
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>And to the loosen'd reins permits the laws.
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>High on the waves his azure car he guides;
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>Its axles thunder, and the sea subsides,
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>And the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides.
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>The tempests fly before their father's face,
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>Trains of inferior gods his triumph grace,
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>And monster whales before their master play,
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>And choirs of Tritons crowd the wat'ry way.
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>The marshal'd pow'rs in equal troops divide
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>To right and left; the gods his better side
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>Inclose, and on the worse the Nymphs and Nereids 
<A NAME="1114"></A>ride.
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>Now smiling hope, with sweet vicissitude,
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>Within the hero's mind his joys renew'd.
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>He calls to raise the masts, the sheets display;
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>The cheerful crew with diligence obey;
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>They scud before the wind, and sail in open sea.
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>Ahead of all the master pilot steers;
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>And, as he leads, the following navy veers.
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>The steeds of Night had travel'd half the sky,
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>The drowsy rowers on their benches lie,
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>When the soft God of Sleep, with easy flight,
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>Descends, and draws behind a trail of light.
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>Thou, Palinurus, art his destin'd prey;
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>To thee alone he takes his fatal way.
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>Dire dreams to thee, and iron sleep, he bears;
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>And, lighting on thy prow, the form of Phorbas wears.
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>Then thus the traitor god began his tale:
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>"The winds, my friend, inspire a pleasing gale;
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>The ships, without thy care, securely sail.
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>Now steal an hour of sweet repose; and I
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>Will take the rudder and thy room supply."
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR>To whom the yawning pilot, half asleep:
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>"Me dost thou bid to trust the treach'rous deep,
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>The harlot smiles of her dissembling face,
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR>And to her faith commit the Trojan race?
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>Shall I believe the Siren South again,
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>And, oft betray'd, not know the monster main?"
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR>He said: his fasten'd hands the rudder keep,
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>And, fix'd on heav'n, his eyes repel invading sleep.
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>The god was wroth, and at his temples threw
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR>A branch in Lethe dipp'd, and drunk with Stygian 
<A NAME="1145"></A>dew:
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>The pilot, vanquish'd by the pow'r divine,
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>Soon clos'd his swimming eyes, and lay supine.
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR>Scarce were his limbs extended at their length,
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR>The god, insulting with superior strength,
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR>Fell heavy on him, plung'd him in the sea,
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR>And, with the stern, the rudder tore away.
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR>Headlong he fell, and, struggling in the main,
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR>Cried out for helping hands, but cried in vain.
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR>The victor daemon mounts obscure in air,
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>While the ship sails without the pilot's care.
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR>On Neptune's faith the floating fleet relies;
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR>But what the man forsook, the god supplies,
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR>And o'er the dang'rous deep secure the navy flies;
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR>Glides by the Sirens' cliffs, a shelfy coast,
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR>Long infamous for ships and sailors lost,
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR>And white with bones. Th' impetuous ocean roars,
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>And rocks rebellow from the sounding shores.
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR>The watchful hero felt the knocks, and found
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR>The tossing vessel sail'd on shoaly ground.
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR>Sure of his pilot's loss, he takes himself
<A NAME="1166"></A><BR>The helm, and steers aloof, and shuns the shelf.
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR>Inly he griev'd, and, groaning from the breast,
<A NAME="1168"></A><BR>Deplor'd his death; and thus his pain express'd:
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR>"For faith repos'd on seas, and on the flatt'ring 
<A NAME="1170"></A>sky,
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR>Thy naked corpse is doom'd on shores unknown to 
<A NAME="1172"></A>lie."
