<A NAME="10"></A>But anxious cares already seiz'd the queen:
<A NAME="11"></A><BR>She fed within her veins a flame unseen;
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>The hero's valor, acts, and birth inspire
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>His words, his looks, imprinted in her heart,
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Improve the passion, and increase the smart.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Now, when the purple morn had chas'd away
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>The dewy shadows, and restor'd the day,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Her sister first with early care she sought,
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>And thus in mournful accents eas'd her thought:
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>"My dearest Anna, what new dreams affright
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>My lab'ring soul! what visions of the night
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Disturb my quiet, and distract my breast
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>With strange ideas of our Trojan guest!
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>His worth, his actions, and majestic air,
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>A man descended from the gods declare.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Fear ever argues a degenerate kind;
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>His birth is well asserted by his mind.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>Then, what he suffer'd, when by Fate betray'd!
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>What brave attempts for falling Troy he made!
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>Such were his looks, so gracefully he spoke,
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>That, were I not resolv'd against the yoke
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Of hapless marriage, never to be curst
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>With second love, so fatal was my first,
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>To this one error I might yield again;
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>For, since Sichaeus was untimely slain,
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>This only man is able to subvert
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>The fix'd foundations of my stubborn heart.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>And, to confess my frailty, to my shame,
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Somewhat I find within, if not the same,
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Too like the sparkles of my former flame.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>But first let yawning earth a passage rend,
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>And let me thro' the dark abyss descend;
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>First let avenging Jove, with flames from high,
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Drive down this body to the nether sky,
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Condemn'd with ghosts in endless night to lie,
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Before I break the plighted faith I gave!
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>No! he who had my vows shall ever have;
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>For, whom I lov'd on earth, I worship in the grave."
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>She said: the tears ran gushing from her eyes,
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>And stopp'd her speech. Her sister thus replies:
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>"O dearer than the vital air I breathe,
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>Will you to grief your blooming years bequeath,
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Condemn'd to waste in woes your lonely life,
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Without the joys of mother or of wife?
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Think you these tears, this pompous train of woe,
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Are known or valued by the ghosts below?
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>I grant that, while your sorrows yet were green,
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>It well became a woman, and a queen,
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>The vows of Tyrian princes to neglect,
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>To scorn Hyarbas, and his love reject,
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>With all the Libyan lords of mighty name;
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>But will you fight against a pleasing flame!
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>This little spot of land, which Heav'n bestows,
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>On ev'ry side is hemm'd with warlike foes;
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Gaetulian cities here are spread around,
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>And fierce Numidians there your frontiers bound;
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Here lies a barren waste of thirsty land,
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>And there the Syrtes raise the moving sand;
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Barcaean troops besiege the narrow shore,
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>And from the sea Pygmalion threatens more.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Propitious Heav'n, and gracious Juno, lead
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>This wand'ring navy to your needful aid:
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>How will your empire spread, your city rise,
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>From such a union, and with such allies?
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Implore the favor of the pow'rs above,
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>And leave the conduct of the rest to love.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Continue still your hospitable way,
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>And still invent occasions of their stay,
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Till storms and winter winds shall cease to threat,
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>And planks and oars repair their shatter'd fleet."
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>These words, which from a friend and sister came,
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>With ease resolv'd the scruples of her fame,
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>And added fury to the kindled flame.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Inspir'd with hope, the project they pursue;
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>On ev'ry altar sacrifice renew:
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>A chosen ewe of two years old they pay
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>To Ceres, Bacchus, and the God of Day;
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Preferring Juno's pow'r, for Juno ties
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>The nuptial knot and makes the marriage joys.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>The beauteous queen before her altar stands,
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>And holds the golden goblet in her hands.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>A milk-white heifer she with flow'rs adorns,
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>And pours the ruddy wine betwixt her horns;
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>And, while the priests with pray'r the gods invoke,
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>She feeds their altars with Sabaean smoke,
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>With hourly care the sacrifice renews,
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>And anxiously the panting entrails views.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>What priestly rites, alas! what pious art,
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>What vows avail to cure a bleeding heart!
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>A gentle fire she feeds within her veins,
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Where the soft god secure in silence reigns.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Sick with desire, and seeking him she loves,
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>From street to street the raving Dido roves.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>So when the watchful shepherd, from the blind,
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Wounds with a random shaft the careless hind,
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Distracted with her pain she flies the woods,
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Bounds o'er the lawn, and seeks the silent floods,
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>With fruitless care; for still the fatal dart
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Sticks in her side, and rankles in her heart.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>And now she leads the Trojan chief along
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>The lofty walls, amidst the busy throng;
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Displays her Tyrian wealth, and rising town,
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Which love, without his labor, makes his own.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>This pomp she shows, to tempt her wand'ring guest;
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>Her falt'ring tongue forbids to speak the rest.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>When day declines, and feasts renew the night,
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>Still on his face she feeds her famish'd sight;
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>She longs again to hear the prince relate
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>His own adventures and the Trojan fate.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>He tells it o'er and o'er; but still in vain,
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>For still she begs to hear it once again.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>The hearer on the speaker's mouth depends,
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>And thus the tragic story never ends.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Then, when they part, when Phoebe's paler light
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Withdraws, and falling stars to sleep invite,
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>She last remains, when ev'ry guest is gone,
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Sits on the bed he press'd, and sighs alone;
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Absent, her absent hero sees and hears;
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Or in her bosom young Ascanius bears,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>And seeks the father's image in the child,
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>If love by likeness might be so beguil'd.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Meantime the rising tow'rs are at a stand;
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>No labors exercise the youthful band,
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Nor use of arts, nor toils of arms they know;
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>The mole is left unfinish'd to the foe;
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>The mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie,
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Short of their promis'd heighth, that seem'd to threat the 
<A NAME="138"></A>sky,
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>But when imperial Juno, from above,
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>Saw Dido fetter'd in the chains of love,
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>Hot with the venom which her veins inflam'd,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>And by no sense of shame to be reclaim'd,
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>With soothing words to Venus she begun:
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>"High praises, endless honors, you have won,
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>And mighty trophies, with your worthy son!
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>Two gods a silly woman have undone!
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Nor am I ignorant, you both suspect
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>This rising city, which my hands erect:
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>But shall celestial discord never cease?
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>'T is better ended in a lasting peace.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>You stand possess'd of all your soul desir'd:
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Poor Dido with consuming love is fir'd.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Your Trojan with my Tyrian let us join;
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>So Dido shall be yours, Aeneas mine:
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>One common kingdom, one united line.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Eliza shall a Dardan lord obey,
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>And lofty Carthage for a dow'r convey."
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>Then Venus, who her hidden fraud descried,
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Which would the scepter of the world misguide
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>To Libyan shores, thus artfully replied:
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>"Who, but a fool, would wars with Juno choose,
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>And such alliance and such gifts refuse,
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>If Fortune with our joint desires comply?
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>The doubt is all from Jove and destiny;
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Lest he forbid, with absolute command,
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>To mix the people in one common land-
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>Or will the Trojan and the Tyrian line
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>In lasting leagues and sure succession join?
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>But you, the partner of his bed and throne,
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>May move his mind; my wishes are your own."
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>"Mine," said imperial Juno, "be the care;
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Time urges, now, to perfect this affair:
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>Attend my counsel, and the secret share.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>When next the Sun his rising light displays,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>And gilds the world below with purple rays,
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>The queen, Aeneas, and the Tyrian court
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Shall to the shady woods, for sylvan game, resort.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>There, while the huntsmen pitch their toils around,
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>And cheerful horns from side to side resound,
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>A pitchy cloud shall cover all the plain
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>With hail, and thunder, and tempestuous rain;
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>The fearful train shall take their speedy flight,
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Dispers'd, and all involv'd in gloomy night;
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>One cave a grateful shelter shall afford
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>To the fair princess and the Trojan lord.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>I will myself the bridal bed prepare,
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>If you, to bless the nuptials, will be there:
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>So shall their loves be crown'd with due delights,
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>And Hymen shall be present at the rites."
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>The Queen of Love consents, and closely smiles
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>At her vain project, and discover'd wiles.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>The rosy morn was risen from the main,
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>And horns and hounds awake the princely train:
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>They issue early thro' the city gate,
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Where the more wakeful huntsmen ready wait,
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>With nets, and toils, and darts, beside the force
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>Of Spartan dogs, and swift Massylian horse.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>The Tyrian peers and officers of state
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>For the slow queen in antechambers wait;
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Her lofty courser, in the court below,
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Who his majestic rider seems to know,
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Proud of his purple trappings, paws the ground,
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>And champs the golden bit, and spreads the foam 
<A NAME="204"></A>around.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>The queen at length appears; on either hand
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>The brawny guards in martial order stand.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>A flow'r'd simar with golden fringe she wore,
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>And at her back a golden quiver bore;
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Her flowing hair a golden caul restrains,
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>A golden clasp the Tyrian robe sustains.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Then young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace,
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>Leads on the Trojan youth to view the chase.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>But far above the rest in beauty shines
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>The great Aeneas, the troop he joins;
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Like fair Apollo, when he leaves the frost
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Of wint'ry Xanthus, and the Lycian coast,
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>When to his native Delos he resorts,
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Ordains the dances, and renews the sports;
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Where painted Scythians, mix'd with Cretan bands,
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Before the joyful altars join their hands:
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Himself, on Cynthus walking, sees below
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>The merry madness of the sacred show.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>Green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose;
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>A golden fillet binds his awful brows;
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>His quiver sounds: not less the prince is seen
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>In manly presence, or in lofty mien.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Now had they reach'd the hills, and storm'd the 
<A NAME="228"></A>seat
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Of salvage beasts, in dens, their last retreat.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>The cry pursues the mountain goats: they bound
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>From rock to rock, and keep the craggy ground;
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>Quite otherwise the stags, a trembling train,
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>In herds unsingled, scour the dusty plain,
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>And a long chase in open view maintain.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>The glad Ascanius, as his courser guides,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Spurs thro' the vale, and these and those outrides.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>His horse's flanks and sides are forc'd to feel
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>The clanking lash, and goring of the steel.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Impatiently he views the feeble prey,
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Wishing some nobler beast to cross his way,
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>And rather would the tusky boar attend,
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Or see the tawny lion downward bend.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Meantime, the gath'ring clouds obscure the skies:
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>From pole to pole the forky lightning flies;
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>The rattling thunders roll; and Juno pours
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>A wintry deluge down, and sounding show'rs.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>The company, dispers'd, to converts ride,
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>And seek the homely cots, or mountain's hollow side.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>The rapid rains, descending from the hills,
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>To rolling torrents raise the creeping rills.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>The queen and prince, as love or fortune guides,
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>One common cavern in her bosom hides.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Then first the trembling earth the signal gave,
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>And flashing fires enlighten all the cave;
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Hell from below, and Juno from above,
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>And howling nymphs, were conscious of their love.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>From this ill-omen'd hour in time arose
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Debate and death, and all succeeding woes.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>The queen, whom sense of honor could not move,
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>No longer made a secret of her love,
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>But call'd it marriage, by that specious name
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>To veil the crime and sanctify the shame.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>The loud report thro' Libyan cities goes.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Fame, the great ill, from small beginnings grows:
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Swift from the first; and ev'ry moment brings
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>New vigor to her flights, new pinions to her wings.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Soon grows the pigmy to gigantic size;
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>Her feet on earth, her forehead in the skies.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Inrag'd against the gods, revengeful Earth
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Produc'd her last of the Titanian birth.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Swift is her walk, more swift her winged haste:
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>A monstrous phantom, horrible and vast.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>As many plumes as raise her lofty flight,
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>So many piercing eyes inlarge her sight;
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Millions of opening mouths to Fame belong,
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>And ev'ry mouth is furnish'd with a tongue,
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>And round with list'ning ears the flying plague is 
<A NAME="278"></A>hung.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>She fills the peaceful universe with cries;
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>No slumbers ever close her wakeful eyes;
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>By day, from lofty tow'rs her head she shews,
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>And spreads thro' trembling crowds disastrous news;
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>With court informers haunts, and royal spies;
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Things done relates, not done she feigns, and mingles truth 
<A NAME="285"></A>with
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>lies.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Talk is her business, and her chief delight
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>To tell of prodigies and cause affright.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>She fills the people's ears with Dido's name,
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Who, lost to honor and the sense of shame,
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Admits into her throne and nuptial bed
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>A wand'ring guest, who from his country fled:
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Whole days with him she passes in delights,
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>And wastes in luxury long winter nights,
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Forgetful of her fame and royal trust,
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Dissolv'd in ease, abandon'd to her lust.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>The goddess widely spreads the loud report,
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>And flies at length to King Hyarba's court.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>When first possess'd with this unwelcome news
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>Whom did he not of men and gods accuse?
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>This prince, from ravish'd Garamantis born,
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>A hundred temples did with spoils adorn,
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>In Ammon's honor, his celestial sire;
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>A hundred altars fed with wakeful fire;
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>And, thro' his vast dominions, priests ordain'd,
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>Whose watchful care these holy rites maintain'd.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>The gates and columns were with garlands crown'd,
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>And blood of victim beasts enrich'd the ground.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>He, when he heard a fugitive could move
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>The Tyrian princess, who disdain'd his love,
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>His breast with fury burn'd, his eyes with fire,
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Mad with despair, impatient with desire;
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>Then on the sacred altars pouring wine,
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>He thus with pray'rs implor'd his sire divine:
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>"Great Jove! propitious to the Moorish race,
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Who feast on painted beds, with off'rings grace
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Thy temples, and adore thy pow'r divine
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>With blood of victims, and with sparkling wine,
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Seest thou not this? or do we fear in vain
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Thy boasted thunder, and thy thoughtless reign?
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Do thy broad hands the forky lightnings lance?
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Thine are the bolts, or the blind work of chance?
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>A wand'ring woman builds, within our state,
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>A little town, bought at an easy rate;
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>She pays me homage, and my grants allow
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>A narrow space of Libyan lands to plow;
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Yet, scorning me, by passion blindly led,
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Admits a banish'd Trojan to her bed!
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>And now this other Paris, with his train
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Of conquer'd cowards, must in Afric reign!
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>(Whom, what they are, their looks and garb confess,
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Their locks with oil perfum'd, their Lydian dress.)
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>He takes the spoil, enjoys the princely dame;
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>And I, rejected I, adore an empty name."
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>His vows, in haughty terms, he thus preferr'd,
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>And held his altar's horns. The mighty Thund'rer 
<A NAME="337"></A>heard;
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Then cast his eyes on Carthage, where he found
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>The lustful pair in lawless pleasure drown'd,
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Lost in their loves, insensible of shame,
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>And both forgetful of their better fame.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>He calls Cyllenius, and the god attends,
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>By whom his menacing command he sends:
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>"Go, mount the western winds, and cleave the sky;
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>Then, with a swift descent, to Carthage fly:
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>There find the Trojan chief, who wastes his days
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>In slothful not and inglorious ease,
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Nor minds the future city, giv'n by fate.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>To him this message from my mouth relate:
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>'Not so fair Venus hop'd, when twice she won
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>Thy life with pray'rs, nor promis'd such a son.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>Hers was a hero, destin'd to command
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>A martial race, and rule the Latian land,
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>Who should his ancient line from Teucer draw,
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>And on the conquer'd world impose the law.'
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>If glory cannot move a mind so mean,
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Nor future praise from fading pleasure wean,
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Yet why should he defraud his son of fame,
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>And grudge the Romans their immortal name!
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>What are his vain designs! what hopes he more
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>From his long ling'ring on a hostile shore,
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Regardless to redeem his honor lost,
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>And for his race to gain th' Ausonian coast!
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Bid him with speed the Tyrian court forsake;
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>With this command the slumb'ring warrior wake."
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Hermes obeys; with golden pinions binds
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>His flying feet, and mounts the western winds:
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>And, whether o'er the seas or earth he flies,
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>With rapid force they bear him down the skies.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>But first he grasps within his awful hand
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>The mark of sov'reign pow'r, his magic wand;
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>With this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves;
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>With this he drives them down the Stygian waves;
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>With this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight,
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>And eyes, tho' clos'd in death, restores to light.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Thus arm'd, the god begins his airy race,
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>And drives the racking clouds along the liquid space;
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Now sees the tops of Atlas, as he flies,
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Whose brawny back supports the starry skies;
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Atlas, whose head, with piny forests crown'd,
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Is beaten by the winds, with foggy vapors bound.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Snows hide his shoulders; from beneath his chin
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>The founts of rolling streams their race begin;
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>A beard of ice on his large breast depends.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Here, pois'd upon his wings, the god descends:
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Then, rested thus, he from the tow'ring height
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Plung'd downward, with precipitated flight,
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Lights on the seas, and skims along the flood.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>As waterfowl, who seek their fishy food,
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Less, and yet less, to distant prospect show;
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>By turns they dance aloft, and dive below:
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Like these, the steerage of his wings he plies,
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>And near the surface of the water flies,
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>Till, having pass'd the seas, and cross'd the sands,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>He clos'd his wings, and stoop'd on Libyan lands:
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>Where shepherds once were hous'd in homely sheds,
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Now tow'rs within the clouds advance their heads.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Arriving there, he found the Trojan prince
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>New ramparts raising for the town's defense.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>A purple scarf, with gold embroider'd o'er,
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>(Queen Dido's gift,) about his waist he wore;
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>A sword, with glitt'ring gems diversified,
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>For ornament, not use, hung idly by his side.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>Then thus, with winged words, the god began,
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>Resuming his own shape: "Degenerate man,
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Thou woman's property, what mak'st thou here,
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>These foreign walls and Tyrian tow'rs to rear,
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Forgetful of thy own? All-pow'rful Jove,
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Who sways the world below and heav'n above,
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Has sent me down with this severe command:
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>What means thy ling'ring in the Libyan land?
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>If glory cannot move a mind so mean,
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Nor future praise from flitting pleasure wean,
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Regard the fortunes of thy rising heir:
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>The promis'd crown let young Ascanius wear,
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>To whom th' Ausonian scepter, and the state
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Of Rome's imperial name is ow'd by fate."
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>So spoke the god; and, speaking, took his flight,
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Involv'd in clouds, and vanish'd out of sight.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>The pious prince was seiz'd with sudden fear;
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Mute was his tongue, and upright stood his hair.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Revolving in his mind the stern command,
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>He longs to fly, and loathes the charming land.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>What should he say? or how should he begin?
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>What course, alas! remains to steer between
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Th' offended lover and the pow'rful queen?
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>This way and that he turns his anxious mind,
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>And all expedients tries, and none can find.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Fix'd on the deed, but doubtful of the means,
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>After long thought, to this advice he leans:
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Three chiefs he calls, commands them to repair
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>The fleet, and ship their men with silent care;
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Some plausible pretense he bids them find,
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>To color what in secret he design'd.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Himself, meantime, the softest hours would choose,
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Before the love-sick lady heard the news;
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>And move her tender mind, by slow degrees,
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>To suffer what the sov'reign pow'r decrees:
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Jove will inspire him, when, and what to say.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>They hear with pleasure, and with haste obey.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>But soon the queen perceives the thin disguise:
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>(What arts can blind a jealous woman's eyes!)
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>She was the first to find the secret fraud,
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Before the fatal news was blaz'd abroad.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Love the first motions of the lover hears,
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Quick to presage, and ev'n in safety fears.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Nor impious Fame was wanting to report
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>The ships repair'd, the Trojans' thick resort,
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>And purpose to forsake the Tyrian court.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>Frantic with fear, impatient of the wound,
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>And impotent of mind, she roves the city round.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Less wild the Bacchanalian dames appear,
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>When, from afar, their nightly god they hear,
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>And howl about the hills, and shake the wreathy 
<A NAME="455"></A>spear.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>At length she finds the dear perfidious man;
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Prevents his form'd excuse, and thus began:
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>"Base and ungrateful! could you hope to fly,
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>And undiscover'd scape a lover's eye?
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Nor could my kindness your compassion move.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Nor plighted vows, nor dearer bands of love?
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Or is the death of a despairing queen
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>Not worth preventing, tho' too well foreseen?
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Ev'n when the wintry winds command your stay,
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>You dare the tempests, and defy the sea.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>False as you are, suppose you were not bound
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>To lands unknown, and foreign coasts to sound;
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Were Troy restor'd, and Priam's happy reign,
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Now durst you tempt, for Troy, the raging main?
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>See whom you fly! am I the foe you shun?
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Now, by those holy vows, so late begun,
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>By this right hand, (since I have nothing more
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>To challenge, but the faith you gave before;)
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>I beg you by these tears too truly shed,
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>By the new pleasures of our nuptial bed;
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>If ever Dido, when you most were kind,
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Were pleasing in your eyes, or touch'd your mind;
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>By these my pray'rs, if pray'rs may yet have place,
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Pity the fortunes of a falling race.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>For you I have provok'd a tyrant's hate,
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Incens'd the Libyan and the Tyrian state;
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>For you alone I suffer in my fame,
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Bereft of honor, and expos'd to shame.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Whom have I now to trust, ungrateful guest?
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>(That only name remains of all the rest!)
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>What have I left? or whither can I fly?
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Must I attend Pygmalion's cruelty,
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>Or till Hyarba shall in triumph lead
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>A queen that proudly scorn'd his proffer'd bed?
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Had you deferr'd, at least, your hasty flight,
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>And left behind some pledge of our delight,
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>Some babe to bless the mother's mournful sight,
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Some young Aeneas, to supply your place,
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Whose features might express his father's face;
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>I should not then complain to live bereft
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Of all my husband, or be wholly left."
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Here paus'd the queen. Unmov'd he holds his eyes,
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>By Jove's command; nor suffer'd love to rise,
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Tho' heaving in his heart; and thus at length replies:
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>"Fair queen, you never can enough repeat
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Your boundless favors, or I own my debt;
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Nor can my mind forget Eliza's name,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>While vital breath inspires this mortal frame.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>This only let me speak in my defense:
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>I never hop'd a secret flight from hence,
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Much less pretended to the lawful claim
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Of sacred nuptials, or a husband's name.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>For, if indulgent Heav'n would leave me free,
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>And not submit my life to fate's decree,
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>My choice would lead me to the Trojan shore,
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>Those relics to review, their dust adore,
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>And Priam's ruin'd palace to restore.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>But now the Delphian oracle commands,
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>And fate invites me to the Latian lands.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>That is the promis'd place to which I steer,
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>And all my vows are terminated there.
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>If you, a Tyrian, and a stranger born,
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>With walls and tow'rs a Libyan town adorn,
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Why may not we- like you, a foreign race-
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Like you, seek shelter in a foreign place?
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>As often as the night obscures the skies
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>With humid shades, or twinkling stars arise,
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>Anchises' angry ghost in dreams appears,
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Chides my delay, and fills my soul with fears;
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>And young Ascanius justly may complain
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Of his defrauded and destin'd reign.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Ev'n now the herald of the gods appear'd:
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Waking I saw him, and his message heard.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>From Jove he came commission'd, heav'nly bright
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>With radiant beams, and manifest to sight
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>(The sender and the sent I both attest)
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>These walls he enter'd, and those words express'd.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Fair queen, oppose not what the gods command;
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>Forc'd by my fate, I leave your happy land."
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>Thus while he spoke, already she began,
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>With sparkling eyes, to view the guilty man;
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>From head to foot survey'd his person o'er,
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Nor longer these outrageous threats forebore:
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>"False as thou art, and, more than false, forsworn!
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Not sprung from noble blood, nor goddess-born,
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>But hewn from harden'd entrails of a rock!
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>And rough Hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck!
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Why should I fawn? what have I worse to fear?
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Did he once look, or lent a list'ning ear,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Sigh'd when I sobb'd, or shed one kindly tear?-
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>All symptoms of a base ungrateful mind,
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>So foul, that, which is worse, 'tis hard to find.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Of man's injustice why should I complain?
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>The gods, and Jove himself, behold in vain
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>Triumphant treason; yet no thunder flies,
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Nor Juno views my wrongs with equal eyes;
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Faithless is earth, and faithless are the skies!
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>Justice is fled, and Truth is now no more!
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>I sav'd the shipwrack'd exile on my shore;
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>With needful food his hungry Trojans fed;
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>I took the traitor to my throne and bed:
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Fool that I was- 't is little to repeat
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>The rest- I stor'd and rigg'd his ruin'd fleet.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>I rave, I rave! A god's command he pleads,
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>And makes Heav'n accessary to his deeds.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Now Lycian lots, and now the Delian god,
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Now Hermes is employ'd from Jove's abode,
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>To warn him hence; as if the peaceful state
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Of heav'nly pow'rs were touch'd with human fate!
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>But go! thy flight no longer I detain-
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Go seek thy promis'd kingdom thro' the main!
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Yet, if the heav'ns will hear my pious vow,
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>The faithless waves, not half so false as thou,
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Or secret sands, shall sepulchers afford
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>To thy proud vessels, and their perjur'd lord.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Then shalt thou call on injur'd Dido's name:
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>Dido shall come in a black sulph'ry flame,
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>When death has once dissolv'd her mortal frame;
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Shall smile to see the traitor vainly weep:
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Her angry ghost, arising from the deep,
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Shall haunt thee waking, and disturb thy sleep.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>At least my shade thy punishment shall know,
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below."
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Abruptly here she stops; then turns away
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Her loathing eyes, and shuns the sight of day.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Amaz'd he stood, revolving in his mind
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>What speech to frame, and what excuse to find.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Her fearful maids their fainting mistress led,
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>And softly laid her on her ivory bed.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>But good Aeneas, tho' he much desir'd
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>To give that pity which her grief requir'd;
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Tho' much he mourn'd, and labor'd with his love,
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Resolv'd at length, obeys the will of Jove;
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>Reviews his forces: they with early care
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>Unmoor their vessels, and for sea prepare.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>The fleet is soon afloat, in all its pride,
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>And well-calk'd galleys in the harbor ride.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Then oaks for oars they fell'd; or, as they stood,
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Of its green arms despoil'd the growing wood,
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Studious of flight. The beach is cover'd o'er
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>With Trojan bands, that blacken all the shore:
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>On ev'ry side are seen, descending down,
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Thick swarms of soldiers, loaden from the town.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>Thus, in battalia, march embodied ants,
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Fearful of winter, and of future wants,
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>T' invade the corn, and to their cells convey
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>The plunder'd forage of their yellow prey.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>The sable troops, along the narrow tracks,
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Scarce bear the weighty burthen on their backs:
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Some set their shoulders to the pond'rous grain;
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Some guard the spoil; some lash the lagging train;
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>All ply their sev'ral tasks, and equal toil sustain.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>What pangs the tender breast of Dido tore,
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>When, from the tow'r, she saw the cover'd shore,
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>And heard the shouts of sailors from afar,
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Mix'd with the murmurs of the wat'ry war!
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>All-pow'rful Love! what changes canst thou cause
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>In human hearts, subjected to thy laws!
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>Once more her haughty soul the tyrant bends:
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>To pray'rs and mean submissions she descends.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>No female arts or aids she left untried,
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Nor counsels unexplor'd, before she died.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>"Look, Anna! look! the Trojans crowd to sea;
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>They spread their canvas, and their anchors weigh.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>The shouting crew their ships with garlands bind,
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Invoke the sea gods, and invite the wind.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Could I have thought this threat'ning blow so near,
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>My tender soul had been forewarn'd to bear.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>But do not you my last request deny;
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>With yon perfidious man your int'rest try,
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>And bring me news, if I must live or die.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>You are his fav'rite; you alone can find
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>The dark recesses of his inmost mind:
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>In all his trusted secrets you have part,
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>And know the soft approaches to his heart.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Haste then, and humbly seek my haughty foe;
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>Tell him, I did not with the Grecians go,
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Nor did my fleet against his friends employ,
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>Nor swore the ruin of unhappy Troy,
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>Nor mov'd with hands profane his father's dust:
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Why should he then reject a just!
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Whom does he shun, and whither would he fly!
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Can he this last, this only pray'r deny!
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Let him at least his dang'rous flight delay,
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Wait better winds, and hope a calmer sea.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>The nuptials he disclaims I urge no more:
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>Let him pursue the promis'd Latian shore.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>A short delay is all I ask him now;
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>A pause of grief, an interval from woe,
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>Till my soft soul be temper'd to sustain
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Accustom'd sorrows, and inur'd to pain.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>If you in pity grant this one request,
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>My death shall glut the hatred of his breast."
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>This mournful message pious Anna bears,
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>And seconds with her own her sister's tears:
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>But all her arts are still employ'd in vain;
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Again she comes, and is refus'd again.
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>His harden'd heart nor pray'rs nor threat'nings 
<A NAME="654"></A>move;
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>Fate, and the god, had stopp'd his ears to love.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>As, when the winds their airy quarrel try,
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>Justling from ev'ry quarter of the sky,
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>This way and that the mountain oak they bend,
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>His boughs they shatter, and his branches rend;
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>With leaves and falling mast they spread the ground;
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>The hollow valleys echo to the sound:
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>Unmov'd, the royal plant their fury mocks,
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>Or, shaken, clings more closely to the rocks;
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>Far as he shoots his tow'ring head on high,
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>So deep in earth his fix'd foundations lie.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>No less a storm the Trojan hero bears;
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Thick messages and loud complaints he hears,
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>And bandied words, still beating on his ears.
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>Sighs, groans, and tears proclaim his inward pains;
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>But the firm purpose of his heart remains.
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>The wretched queen, pursued by cruel fate,
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Begins at length the light of heav'n to hate,
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>And loathes to live. Then dire portents she sees,
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>To hasten on the death her soul decrees:
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Strange to relate! for when, before the shrine,
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>She pours in sacrifice the purple wine,
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>The purple wine is turn'd to putrid blood,
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>And the white offer'd milk converts to mud.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>This dire presage, to her alone reveal'd,
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>From all, and ev'n her sister, she conceal'd.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>A marble temple stood within the grove,
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Sacred to death, and to her murther'd love;
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>That honor'd chapel she had hung around
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>With snowy fleeces, and with garlands crown'd:
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>Oft, when she visited this lonely dome,
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>Strange voices issued from her husband's tomb;
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>She thought she heard him summon her away,
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>Invite her to his grave, and chide her stay.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>Hourly 't is heard, when with a boding note
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>The solitary screech owl strains her throat,
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>And, on a chimney's top, or turret's height,
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>With songs obscene disturbs the silence of the night.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>Besides, old prophecies augment her fears;
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>And stern Aeneas in her dreams appears,
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>Disdainful as by day: she seems, alone,
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>To wander in her sleep, thro' ways unknown,
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Guideless and dark; or, in a desart plain,
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>To seek her subjects, and to seek in vain:
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>Like Pentheus, when, distracted with his fear,
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>He saw two suns, and double Thebes, appear;
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>Or mad Orestes, when his mother's ghost
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Full in his face infernal torches toss'd,
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>And shook her snaky locks: he shuns the sight,
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Flies o'er the stage, surpris'd with mortal fright;
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>The Furies guard the door and intercept his flight.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>Now, sinking underneath a load of grief,
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>From death alone she seeks her last relief;
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>The time and means resolv'd within her breast,
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>She to her mournful sister thus address'd
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>(Dissembling hope, her cloudy front she clears,
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>And a false vigor in her eyes appears):
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>"Rejoice!" she said. "Instructed from above,
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>My lover I shall gain, or lose my love.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Nigh rising Atlas, next the falling sun,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>Long tracts of Ethiopian climates run:
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>There a Massylian priestess I have found,
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>Honor'd for age, for magic arts renown'd:
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Th' Hesperian temple was her trusted care;
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>'T was she supplied the wakeful dragon's fare.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>She poppy seeds in honey taught to steep,
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>Reclaim'd his rage, and sooth'd him into sleep.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>She watch'd the golden fruit; her charms unbind
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>The chains of love, or fix them on the mind:
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>She stops the torrents, leaves the channel dry,
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>Repels the stars, and backward bears the sky.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>The yawning earth rebellows to her call,
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>Pale ghosts ascend, and mountain ashes fall.
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>Witness, ye gods, and thou my better part,
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>How loth I am to try this impious art!
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Within the secret court, with silent care,
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Erect a lofty pile, expos'd in air:
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Hang on the topmost part the Trojan vest,
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Spoils, arms, and presents, of my faithless guest.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>Next, under these, the bridal bed be plac'd,
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Where I my ruin in his arms embrac'd:
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>All relics of the wretch are doom'd to fire;
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>For so the priestess and her charms require."
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>Thus far she said, and farther speech forbears;
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>A mortal paleness in her face appears:
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>Yet the mistrustless Anna could not find
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>The secret fun'ral in these rites design'd;
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>Nor thought so dire a rage possess'd her mind.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>Unknowing of a train conceal'd so well,
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>She fear'd no worse than when Sichaeus fell;
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Therefore obeys. The fatal pile they rear,
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>Within the secret court, expos'd in air.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>The cloven holms and pines are heap'd on high,
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>And garlands on the hollow spaces lie.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Sad cypress, vervain, yew, compose the wreath,
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>And ev'ry baleful green denoting death.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>The queen, determin'd to the fatal deed,
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>The spoils and sword he left, in order spread,
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>And the man's image on the nuptial bed.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>And now (the sacred altars plac'd around)
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>The priestess enters, with her hair unbound,
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>And thrice invokes the pow'rs below the ground.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Night, Erebus, and Chaos she proclaims,
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>And threefold Hecate, with her hundred names,
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>And three Dianas: next, she sprinkles round
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>With feign'd Avernian drops the hallow'd ground;
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Culls hoary simples, found by Phoebe's light,
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>With brazen sickles reap'd at noon of night;
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>Then mixes baleful juices in the bowl,
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>And cuts the forehead of a newborn foal,
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>Robbing the mother's love. The destin'd queen
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>Observes, assisting at the rites obscene;
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>A leaven'd cake in her devoted hands
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>She holds, and next the highest altar stands:
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>One tender foot was shod, her other bare;
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>Girt was her gather'd gown, and loose her hair.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>Thus dress'd, she summon'd, with her dying breath,
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>The heav'ns and planets conscious of her death,
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>And ev'ry pow'r, if any rules above,
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>Who minds, or who revenges, injur'd love.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>"'T was dead of night, when weary bodies close
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>Their eyes in balmy sleep and soft repose:
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>The winds no longer whisper thro' the woods,
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>Nor murm'ring tides disturb the gentle floods.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>The stars in silent order mov'd around;
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>And Peace, with downy wings, was brooding on the 
<A NAME="781"></A>ground
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>The flocks and herds, and party-color'd fowl,
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>Which haunt the woods, or swim the weedy pool,
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>Stretch'd on the quiet earth, securely lay,
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>Forgetting the past labors of the day.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>All else of nature's common gift partake:
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>Unhappy Dido was alone awake.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>Nor sleep nor ease the furious queen can find;
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Sleep fled her eyes, as quiet fled her mind.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>Despair, and rage, and love divide her heart;
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>Despair and rage had some, but love the greater 
<A NAME="792"></A>part.
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>Then thus she said within her secret mind:
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>"What shall I do? what succor can I find?
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>Become a suppliant to Hyarba's pride,
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>And take my turn, to court and be denied?
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>Shall I with this ungrateful Trojan go,
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>Forsake an empire, and attend a foe?
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>Himself I refug'd, and his train reliev'd-
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>'T is true- but am I sure to be receiv'd?
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>Can gratitude in Trojan souls have place!
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Laomedon still lives in all his race!
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>Then, shall I seek alone the churlish crew,
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>Or with my fleet their flying sails pursue?
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>What force have I but those whom scarce before
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>I drew reluctant from their native shore?
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>Will they again embark at my desire,
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>Once more sustain the seas, and quit their second 
<A NAME="809"></A>Tyre?
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>Rather with steel thy guilty breast invade,
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>And take the fortune thou thyself hast made.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Your pity, sister, first seduc'd my mind,
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>Or seconded too well what I design'd.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>These dear-bought pleasures had I never known,
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>Had I continued free, and still my own;
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>Avoiding love, I had not found despair,
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>But shar'd with salvage beasts the common air.
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>Like them, a lonely life I might have led,
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>Not mourn'd the living, nor disturb'd the dead."
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>These thoughts she brooded in her anxious breast.
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>On board, the Trojan found more easy rest.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>Resolv'd to sail, in sleep he pass'd the night;
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>And order'd all things for his early flight.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>To whom once more the winged god appears;
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>His former youthful mien and shape he wears,
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>And with this new alarm invades his ears:
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>"Sleep'st thou, O goddess-born! and canst thou drown
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>Thy needful cares, so near a hostile town,
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>Beset with foes; nor hear'st the western gales
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>Invite thy passage, and inspire thy sails?
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>She harbors in her heart a furious hate,
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>And thou shalt find the dire effects too late;
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>Fix'd on revenge, and obstinate to die.
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>Haste swiftly hence, while thou hast pow'r to fly.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>The sea with ships will soon be cover'd o'er,
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>And blazing firebrands kindle all the shore.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>Prevent her rage, while night obscures the skies,
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>And sail before the purple morn arise.
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>Who knows what hazards thy delay may bring?
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Woman's a various and a changeful thing."
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>Thus Hermes in the dream; then took his flight
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>Aloft in air unseen, and mix'd with night.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>Twice warn'd by the celestial messenger,
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>The pious prince arose with hasty fear;
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>Then rous'd his drowsy train without delay:
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>"Haste to your banks; your crooked anchors weigh,
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>And spread your flying sails, and stand to sea.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>A god commands: he stood before my sight,
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>And urg'd us once again to speedy flight.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>O sacred pow'r, what pow'r soe'er thou art,
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>To thy blest orders I resign my heart.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>Lead thou the way; protect thy Trojan bands,
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>And prosper the design thy will commands."
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>He said: and, drawing forth his flaming sword,
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>His thund'ring arm divides the many-twisted cord.
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>An emulating zeal inspires his train:
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>They run; they snatch; they rush into the main.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>With headlong haste they leave the desert shores,
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>And brush the liquid seas with lab'ring oars.
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>Aurora now had left her saffron bed,
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>And beams of early light the heav'ns o'erspread,
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>When, from a tow'r, the queen, with wakeful eyes,
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>Saw day point upward from the rosy skies.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>She look'd to seaward; but the sea was void,
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>And scarce in ken the sailing ships descried.
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>Stung with despite, and furious with despair,
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>She struck her trembling breast, and tore her hair.
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>"And shall th' ungrateful traitor go," she said,
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>"My land forsaken, and my love betray'd?
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>Shall we not arm? not rush from ev'ry street,
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>To follow, sink, and burn his perjur'd fleet?
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>Haste, haul my galleys out! pursue the foe!
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>Bring flaming brands! set sail, and swiftly row!
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>What have I said? where am I? Fury turns
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>My brain; and my distemper'd bosom burns.
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>Then, when I gave my person and my throne,
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>This hate, this rage, had been more timely shown.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>See now the promis'd faith, the vaunted name,
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>The pious man, who, rushing thro' the flame,
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>Preserv'd his gods, and to the Phrygian shore
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>The burthen of his feeble father bore!
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>I should have torn him piecemeal; strow'd in floods
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>His scatter'd limbs, or left expos'd in woods;
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>Destroy'd his friends and son; and, from the fire,
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>Have set the reeking boy before the sire.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>Events are doubtful, which on battles wait:
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>Yet where's the doubt, to souls secure of fate?
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>My Tyrians, at their injur'd queen's command,
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>Had toss'd their fires amid the Trojan band;
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>At once extinguish'd all the faithless name;
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>And I myself, in vengeance of my shame,
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>Had fall'n upon the pile, to mend the fun'ral flame.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>Thou Sun, who view'st at once the world below;
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>Thou Juno, guardian of the nuptial vow;
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>Thou Hecate hearken from thy dark abodes!
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>Ye Furies, fiends, and violated gods,
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>All pow'rs invok'd with Dido's dying breath,
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>Attend her curses and avenge her death!
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>If so the Fates ordain, Jove commands,
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>Th' ungrateful wretch should find the Latian lands,
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>Yet let a race untam'd, and haughty foes,
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>His peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose:
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>Oppress'd with numbers in th' unequal field,
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>His men discourag'd, and himself expell'd,
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>Let him for succor sue from place to place,
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>Torn from his subjects, and his son's embrace.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>First, let him see his friends in battle slain,
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>And their untimely fate lament in vain;
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>And when, at length, the cruel war shall cease,
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>On hard conditions may he buy his peace:
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>Nor let him then enjoy supreme command;
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>But fall, untimely, by some hostile hand,
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>And lie unburied on the barren sand!
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>These are my pray'rs, and this my dying will;
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>And you, my Tyrians, ev'ry curse fulfil.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>Perpetual hate and mortal wars proclaim,
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>Against the prince, the people, and the name.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>These grateful off'rings on my grave bestow;
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>Nor league, nor love, the hostile nations know!
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>Now, and from hence, in ev'ry future age,
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>When rage excites your arms, and strength supplies the 
<A NAME="922"></A>rage
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>Rise some avenger of our Libyan blood,
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>With fire and sword pursue the perjur'd brood;
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>Our arms, our seas, our shores, oppos'd to theirs;
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>And the same hate descend on all our heirs!"
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>This said, within her anxious mind she weighs
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>The means of cutting short her odious days.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>Then to Sichaeus' nurse she briefly said
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>(For, when she left her country, hers was dead):
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>"Go, Barce, call my sister. Let her care
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>The solemn rites of sacrifice prepare;
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>The sheep, and all th' atoning off'rings bring,
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>Sprinkling her body from the crystal spring
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>With living drops; then let her come, and thou
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>With sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>Thus will I pay my vows to Stygian Jove,
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>And end the cares of my disastrous love;
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>Then cast the Trojan image on the fire,
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>And, as that burns, my passions shall expire."
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>The nurse moves onward, with officious care,
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>And all the speed her aged limbs can bear.
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>But furious Dido, with dark thoughts involv'd,
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>Shook at the mighty mischief she resolv'd.
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>With livid spots distinguish'd was her face;
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>Red were her rolling eyes, and discompos'd her pace;
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>Ghastly she gaz'd, with pain she drew her breath,
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>And nature shiver'd at approaching death.
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>Then swiftly to the fatal place she pass'd,
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>And mounts the fun'ral pile with furious haste;
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>Unsheathes the sword the Trojan left behind
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>(Not for so dire an enterprise design'd).
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>But when she view'd the garments loosely spread,
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>Which once he wore, and saw the conscious bed,
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>She paus'd, and with a sigh the robes embrac'd;
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>Then on the couch her trembling body cast,
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>Repress'd the ready tears, and spoke her last:
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>"Dear pledges of my love, while Heav'n so pleas'd,
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>Receive a soul, of mortal anguish eas'd:
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>My fatal course is finish'd; and I go,
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>A glorious name, among the ghosts below.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>A lofty city by my hands is rais'd,
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>Pygmalion punish'd, and my lord appeas'd.
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>What could my fortune have afforded more,
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>Had the false Trojan never touch'd my shore!"
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>Then kiss'd the couch; and, "Must I die," she said,
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>"And unreveng'd? 'T is doubly to be dead!
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>Yet ev'n this death with pleasure I receive:
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>On any terms, 't is better than to live.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>These flames, from far, may the false Trojan view;
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>These boding omens his base flight pursue!"
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>She said, and struck; deep enter'd in her side
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>The piercing steel, with reeking purple dyed:
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>Clogg'd in the wound the cruel weapon stands;
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>The spouting blood came streaming on her hands.
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>Her sad attendants saw the deadly stroke,
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>And with loud cries the sounding palace shook.
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>Distracted, from the fatal sight they fled,
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>And thro' the town the dismal rumor spread.
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>First from the frighted court the yell began;
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>Redoubled, thence from house to house it ran:
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>The groans of men, with shrieks, laments, and cries
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>Of mixing women, mount the vaulted skies.
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>Not less the clamor, than if- ancient Tyre,
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>Or the new Carthage, set by foes on fire-
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>The rolling ruin, with their lov'd abodes,
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>Involv'd the blazing temples of their gods.
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>Her sister hears; and, furious with despair,
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>She beats her breast, and rends her yellow hair,
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>And, calling on Eliza's name aloud,
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>Runs breathless to the place, and breaks the crowd.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>"Was all that pomp of woe for this prepar'd;
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>These fires, this fun'ral pile, these altars rear'd?
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>Was all this train of plots contriv'd," said she,
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>"All only to deceive unhappy me?
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>Which is the worst? Didst thou in death pretend
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>To scorn thy sister, or delude thy friend?
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>Thy summon'd sister, and thy friend, had come;
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>One sword had serv'd us both, one common tomb:
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>Was I to raise the pile, the pow'rs invoke,
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>Not to be present at the fatal stroke?
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>At once thou hast destroy'd thyself and me,
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>Thy town, thy senate, and thy colony!
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>Bring water; bathe the wound; while I in death
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>Lay close my lips to hers, and catch the flying 
<A NAME="1006"></A>breath."
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>This said, she mounts the pile with eager haste,
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>And in her arms the gasping queen embrac'd;
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>Her temples chaf'd; and her own garments tore,
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>To stanch the streaming blood, and cleanse the gore.
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>Thrice Dido tried to raise her drooping head,
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>And, fainting thrice, fell grov'ling on the bed;
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>Thrice op'd her heavy eyes, and sought the light,
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>But, having found it, sicken'd at the sight,
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>And clos'd her lids at last in endless night.
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>Then Juno, grieving that she should sustain
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>A death so ling'ring, and so full of pain,
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>Sent Iris down, to free her from the strife
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>Of lab'ring nature, and dissolve her life.
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>For since she died, not doom'd by Heav'n's decree,
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>Or her own crime, but human casualty,
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>And rage of love, that plung'd her in despair,
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>The Sisters had not cut the topmost hair,
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>Which Proserpine and they can only know;
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>Nor made her sacred to the shades below.
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>Downward the various goddess took her flight,
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>And drew a thousand colors from the light;
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>Then stood above the dying lover's head,
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>And said: "I thus devote thee to the dead.
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>This off'ring to th' infernal gods I bear."
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>Thus while she spoke, she cut the fatal hair:
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>The struggling soul was loos'd, and life dissolv'd in 
<A NAME="1033"></A>air.
