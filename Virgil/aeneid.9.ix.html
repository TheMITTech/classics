<A NAME="10"></A>While these affairs in distant places pass'd,
<A NAME="11"></A><BR>The various Iris Juno sends with haste,
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>To find bold Turnus, who, with anxious thought,
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>The secret shade of his great grandsire sought.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>Retir'd alone she found the daring man,
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>And op'd her rosy lips, and thus began:
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>"What none of all the gods could grant thy vows,
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>That, Turnus, this auspicious day bestows.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Aeneas, gone to seek th' Arcadian prince,
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Has left the Trojan camp without defense;
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>And, short of succors there, employs his pains
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>Now snatch an hour that favors thy designs;
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Unite thy forces, and attack their lines."
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>This said, on equal wings she pois'd her weight,
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>And form'd a radiant rainbow in her flight.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>The Daunian hero lifts his hands eyes,
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>And thus invokes the goddess as she flies:
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>"Iris, the grace of heav'n, what pow'r divine
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Has sent thee down, thro' dusky clouds to shine?
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>See, they divide; immortal day appears,
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>And glitt'ring planets dancing in their spheres!
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>With joy, these happy omens I obey,
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>And follow to the war the god that leads the way."
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Thus having said, as by the brook he stood,
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>He scoop'd the water from the crystal flood;
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>Then with his hands the drops to heav'n he throws,
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>And loads the pow'rs above with offer'd vows.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Now march the bold confed'rates thro' the plain,
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Well hors'd, well clad; a rich and shining train.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Messapus leads the van; and, in the rear,
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>The sons of Tyrrheus in bright arms appear.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>In the main battle, with his flaming crest,
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>The mighty Turnus tow'rs above the rest.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Silent they move, majestically slow,
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Like ebbing Nile, or Ganges in his flow.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>The Trojans view the dusty cloud from far,
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>And the dark menace of the distant war.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Caicus from the rampire saw it rise,
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>Black'ning the fields, and thick'ning thro' the 
<A NAME="50"></A>skies.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Then to his fellows thus aloud he calls:
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>"What rolling clouds, my friends, approach the walls?
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Arm! arm! and man the works! prepare your spears
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>And pointed darts! the Latian host appears."
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Thus warn'd, they shut their gates; with shouts 
<A NAME="56"></A>ascend
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>The bulwarks, and, secure, their foes attend:
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>For their wise gen'ral, with foreseeing care,
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>Had charg'd them not to tempt the doubtful war,
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>Nor, tho' provok'd, in open fields advance,
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>But close within their lines attend their chance.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Unwilling, yet they keep the strict command,
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>And sourly wait in arms the hostile band.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>The fiery Turnus flew before the rest:
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>A piebald steed of Thracian strain he press'd;
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>His helm of massy gold, and crimson was his crest.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>With twenty horse to second his designs,
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>An unexpected foe, he fac'd the lines.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>"Is there," he said, "in arms, who bravely dare
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>His leader's honor and his danger share?"
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Then spurring on, his brandish'd dart he threw,
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>In sign of war: applauding shouts ensue.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Amaz'd to find a dastard race, that run
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Behind the rampires and the battle shun,
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>He rides around the camp, with rolling eyes,
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>And stops at ev'ry post, and ev'ry passage tries.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>So roams the nightly wolf about the fold:
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Wet with descending show'rs, and stiff with cold,
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>He howls for hunger, and he grins for pain,
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>(His gnashing teeth are exercis'd in vain,)
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>And, impotent of anger, finds no way
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>In his distended paws to grasp the prey.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>The mothers listen; but the bleating lambs
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Securely swig the dug, beneath the dams.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Thus ranges eager Turnus o'er the plain.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Sharp with desire, and furious with disdain;
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Surveys each passage with a piercing sight,
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>To force his foes in equal field to fight.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Thus while he gazes round, at length he spies,
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>Where, fenc'd with strong redoubts, their navy lies,
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Close underneath the walls; the washing tide
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Secures from all approach this weaker side.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>He takes the wish'd occasion, fills his hand
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>With ready fires, and shakes a flaming brand.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Urg'd by his presence, ev'ry soul is warm'd,
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>And ev'ry hand with kindled firs is arm'd.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>From the fir'd pines the scatt'ring sparkles fly;
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Fat vapors, mix'd with flames, involve the sky.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>What pow'r, O Muses, could avert the flame
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Which threaten'd, in the fleet, the Trojan name?
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Tell: for the fact, thro' length of time obscure,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Is hard to faith; yet shall the fame endure.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>'T is said that, when the chief prepar'd his flight,
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>And fell'd his timber from Mount Ida's height,
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>The grandam goddess then approach'd her son,
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>And with a mother's majesty begun:
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>"Grant me," she said, "the sole request I bring,
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Since conquer'd heav'n has own'd you for its king.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>On Ida's brows, for ages past, there stood,
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>With firs and maples fill'd, a shady wood;
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>And on the summit rose a sacred grove,
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Where I was worship'd with religious love.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Those woods, that holy grove, my long delight,
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>I gave the Trojan prince, to speed his flight.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>Now, fill'd with fear, on their behalf I come;
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Let neither winds o'erset, nor waves intomb
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>The floating forests of the sacred pine;
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>But let it be their safety to be mine."
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Then thus replied her awful son, who rolls
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>The radiant stars, and heav'n and earth controls:
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>"How dare you, mother, endless date demand
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>For vessels molded by a mortal hand?
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>What then is fate? Shall bold Aeneas ride,
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Of safety certain, on th' uncertain tide?
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Yet, what I can, I grant; when, wafted o'er,
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>The chief is landed on the Latian shore,
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Whatever ships escape the raging storms,
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>At my command shall change their fading forms
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>To nymphs divine, and plow the wat'ry way,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Like Dotis and the daughters of the sea."
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>To seal his sacred vow, by Styx he swore,
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>The lake of liquid pitch, the dreary shore,
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>And Phlegethon's innavigable flood,
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>And the black regions of his brother god.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>He said; and shook the skies with his imperial nod.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>And now at length the number'd hours were come,
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Prefix'd by fate's irrevocable doom,
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>When the great Mother of the Gods was free
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>To save her ships, and finish Jove's decree.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>First, from the quarter of the morn, there sprung
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>A light that sign'd the heav'ns, and shot along;
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Then from a cloud, fring'd round with golden fires,
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Were timbrels heard, and Berecynthian choirs;
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>And, last, a voice, with more than mortal sounds,
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>Both hosts, in arms oppos'd, with equal horror wounds:
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>"O Trojan race, your needless aid forbear,
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>And know, my ships are my peculiar care.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>With greater ease the bold Rutulian may,
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>With hissing brands, attempt to burn the sea,
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Than singe my sacred pines. But you, my charge,
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Loos'd from your crooked anchors, launch at large,
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Exalted each a nymph: forsake the sand,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>And swim the seas, at Cybele's command."
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>No sooner had the goddess ceas'd to speak,
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>When, lo! th' obedient ships their haulsers break;
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>And, strange to tell, like dolphins, in the main
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>They plunge their prows, and dive, and spring again:
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>As many beauteous maids the billows sweep,
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>As rode before tall vessels on the deep.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>The foes, surpris'd with wonder, stood aghast;
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Messapus curb'd his fiery courser's haste;
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Old Tiber roar'd, and, raising up his head,
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Call'd back his waters to their oozy bed.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>Turnus alone, undaunted, bore the shock,
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>And with these words his trembling troops bespoke:
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>"These monsters for the Trojans' fate are meant,
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>And are by Jove for black presages sent.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>He takes the cowards' last relief away;
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>For fly they cannot, and, constrain'd to stay,
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>Must yield unfought, a base inglorious prey.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>The liquid half of all the globe is lost;
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Heav'n shuts the seas, and we secure the coast.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>Theirs is no more than that small spot of ground
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>Which myriads of our martial men surround.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Their fates I fear not, or vain oracles.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>'T was giv'n to Venus they should cross the seas,
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>And land secure upon the Latian plains:
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>Their promis'd hour is pass'd, and mine remains.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>'T is in the fate of Turnus to destroy,
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>With sword and fire, the faithless race of Troy.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Shall such affronts as these alone inflame
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>The Grecian brothers, and the Grecian name?
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>My cause and theirs is one; a fatal strife,
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>And final ruin, for a ravish'd wife.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Was 't not enough, that, punish'd for the crime,
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>They fell; but will they fall a second time?
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>One would have thought they paid enough before,
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>To curse the costly sex, and durst offend no more.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Can they securely trust their feeble wall,
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>A slight partition, a thin interval,
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Betwixt their fate and them; when Troy, tho' built
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>By hands divine, yet perish'd by their guilt?
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Lend me, for once, my friends, your valiant hands,
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>To force from out their lines these dastard bands.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Less than a thousand ships will end this war,
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Nor Vulcan needs his fated arms prepare.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>Let all the Tuscans, all th' Arcadians, join!
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Nor these, nor those, shall frustrate my design.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Let them not fear the treasons of the night,
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>The robb'd Palladium, the pretended flight:
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Our onset shall be made in open light.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>No wooden engine shall their town betray;
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Fires they shall have around, but fires by day.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>No Grecian babes before their camp appear,
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Whom Hector's arms detain'd to the tenth tardy year.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Now, since the sun is rolling to the west,
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Give we the silent night to needful rest:
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Refresh your bodies, and your arms prepare;
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>The morn shall end the small remains of war."
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>The post of honor to Messapus falls,
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>To keep the nightly guard, to watch the walls,
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>To pitch the fires at distances around,
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>And close the Trojans in their scanty ground.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Twice seven Rutulian captains ready stand,
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>And twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command;
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>All clad in shining arms the works invest,
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Each with a radiant helm and waving crest.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Stretch'd at their length, they press the grassy 
<A NAME="219"></A>ground;
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>They laugh, they sing, (the jolly bowls go round,)
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>With lights and cheerful fires renew the day,
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>And pass the wakeful night in feasts and play.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>The Trojans, from above, their foes beheld,
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>And with arm'd legions all the rampires fill'd.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>Seiz'd with affright, their gates they first explore;
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Join works to works with bridges, tow'r to tow'r:
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Thus all things needful for defense abound.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>Mnestheus and brave Seresthus walk the round,
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Commission'd by their absent prince to share
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>The common danger, and divide the care.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>The soldiers draw their lots, and, as they fall,
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>By turns relieve each other on the wall.
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance,
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>To watch the gate was warlike Nisus' chance.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>His father Hyrtacus of noble blood;
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>His mother was a huntress of the wood,
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>And sent him to the wars. Well could he bear
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>His lance in fight, and dart the flying spear,
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>But better skill'd unerring shafts to send.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Beside him stood Euryalus, his friend:
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Euryalus, than whom the Trojan host
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>No fairer face, or sweeter air, could boast-
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>One was their care, and their delight was one:
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>One common hazard in the war they shar'd,
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>And now were both by choice upon the guard.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Then Nisus thus: "Or do the gods inspire
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>This warmth, or make we gods of our desire?
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>A gen'rous ardor boils within my breast,
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Eager of action, enemy to rest:
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>This urges me to fight, and fires my mind
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>To leave a memorable name behind.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Thou see'st the foe secure; how faintly shine
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Their scatter'd fires! the most, in sleep supine
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Along the ground, an easy conquest lie:
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply;
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>All hush'd around. Now hear what I revolve-
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>A thought unripe- and scarcely yet resolve.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Our absent prince both camp and council mourn;
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>By message both would hasten his return:
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>If they confer what I demand on thee,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>(For fame is recompense enough for me,)
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Methinks, beneath yon hill, I have espied
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>A way that safely will my passage guide."
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Euryalus stood list'ning while he spoke,
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>With love of praise and noble envy struck;
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Then to his ardent friend expos'd his mind:
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>"All this, alone, and leaving me behind!
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Am I unworthy, Nisus, to be join'd?
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Thinkist thou I can my share of glory yield,
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Or send thee unassisted to the field?
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Not so my father taught my childhood arms;
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Born in a siege, and bred among alarms!
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Nor is my youth unworthy of my friend,
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Nor of the heav'n-born hero I attend.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>The thing call'd life, with ease I can disclaim,
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>And think it over-sold to purchase fame."
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>Then Nisus thus: "Alas! thy tender years
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>Would minister new matter to my fears.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>So may the gods, who view this friendly strife,
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Restore me to thy lov'd embrace with life,
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>Condemn'd to pay my vows, (as sure I trust,)
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>This thy request is cruel and unjust.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>But if some chance- as many chances are,
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>And doubtful hazards, in the deeds of war-
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>If one should reach my head, there let it fall,
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>And spare thy life; I would not perish all.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date:
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Live thou to mourn thy love's unhappy fate;
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>To bear my mangled body from the foe,
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Or buy it back, and fun'ral rites bestow.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Or, if hard fortune shall those dues deny,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Thou canst at least an empty tomb supply.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>O let not me the widow's tears renew!
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>Nor let a mother's curse my name pursue:
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Thy pious parent, who, for love of thee,
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>Forsook the coasts of friendly Sicily,
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Her age committing to the seas and wind,
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>When ev'ry weary matron stay'd behind."
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>To this, Euryalus: "You plead in vain,
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>And but protract the cause you cannot gain.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>No more delays, but haste!" With that, he wakes
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>The nodding watch; each to his office takes.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>The guard reliev'd, the gen'rous couple went
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>To find the council at the royal tent.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>All creatures else forgot their daily care,
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>And sleep, the common gift of nature, share;
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>Except the Trojan peers, who wakeful sate
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>In nightly council for th' indanger'd state.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>They vote a message to their absent chief,
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Shew their distress, and beg a swift relief.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Amid the camp a silent seat they chose,
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>Remote from clamor, and secure from foes.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>On their left arms their ample shields they bear,
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>The right reclin'd upon the bending spear.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard,
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>And beg admission, eager to be heard:
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Th' affair important, not to be deferr'd.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Ascanius bids 'em be conducted in,
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Ord'ring the more experienc'd to begin.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Then Nisus thus: "Ye fathers, lend your ears;
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>The foe, securely drench'd in sleep and wine,
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>Neglect their watch; the fires but thinly shine;
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>And where the smoke in cloudy vapors flies,
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Cov'ring the plain, and curling to the skies,
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Betwixt two paths, which at the gate divide,
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Close by the sea, a passage we have spied,
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Which will our way to great Aeneas guide.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Expect each hour to see him safe again,
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Snatch we the lucky minute while we may;
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>Nor can we be mistaken in the way;
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>For, hunting in the vale, we both have seen
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>The rising turrets, and the stream between,
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>And know the winding course, with ev'ry ford."
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>He ceas'd; and old Alethes took the word:
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>"Our country gods, in whom our trust we place,
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race,
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>While we behold such dauntless worth appear
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>In dawning youth, and souls so void of fear."
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>Then into tears of joy the father broke;
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Each in his longing arms by turns he took;
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Panted and paus'd; and thus again he spoke:
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>"Ye brave young men, what equal gifts can we,
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>In recompense of such desert, decree?
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>The greatest, sure, and best you can receive,
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>The gods and your own conscious worth will give.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>The rest our grateful gen'ral will bestow,
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>And young Ascanius till his manhood owe."
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>"And I, whose welfare in my father lies,"
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>Ascanius adds, "by the great deities,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>By my dear country, by my household gods,
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>By hoary Vesta's rites and dark abodes,
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Adjure you both, (on you my fortune stands;
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>That and my faith I plight into your hands,)
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Make me but happy in his safe return,
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Whose wanted presence I can only mourn;
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Your common gift shall two large goblets be
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Of silver, wrought with curious imagery,
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>And high emboss'd, which, when old Priam reign'd,
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>My conqu'ring sire at sack'd Arisba gain'd;
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>And more, two tripods cast in antic mold,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>With two great talents of the finest gold;
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Beside a costly bowl, ingrav'd with art,
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>Which Dido gave, when first she gave her heart.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>But, if in conquer'd Italy we reign,
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>When spoils by lot the victor shall obtain-
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>Thou saw'st the courser by proud Turnus press'd:
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>That, Nisus, and his arms, and nodding crest,
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>And shield, from chance exempt, shall be thy share:
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>Twelve lab'ring slaves, twelve handmaids young and 
<A NAME="373"></A>fair
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>All clad in rich attire, and train'd with care;
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>And, last, a Latian field with fruitful plains,
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>And a large portion of the king's domains.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>But thou, whose years are more to mine allied-
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>No fate my vow'd affection shall divide
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>From thee, heroic youth! Be wholly mine;
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Take full possession; all my soul is thine.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>One faith, one fame, one fate, shall both attend;
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>My life's companion, and my bosom friend:
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>My peace shall be committed to thy care,
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>And to thy conduct my concerns in war."
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Then thus the young Euryalus replied:
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>"Whatever fortune, good or bad, betide,
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>The same shall be my age, as now my youth;
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>No time shall find me wanting to my truth.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>This only from your goodness let me gain
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>(And, this ungranted, all rewards are vain)
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>Of Priam's royal race my mother came-
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>And sure the best that ever bore the name-
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Whom neither Troy nor Sicily could hold
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>From me departing, but, o'erspent and old,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>My fate she follow'd. Ignorant of this
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>(Whatever) danger, neither parting kiss,
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Nor pious blessing taken, her I leave,
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>And in this only act of all my life deceive.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>By this right hand and conscious Night I swear,
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>My soul so sad a farewell could not bear.
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Be you her comfort; fill my vacant place
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>(Permit me to presume so great a grace)
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Support her age, forsaken and distress'd.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>That hope alone will fortify my breast
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>Against the worst of fortunes, and of fears."
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>He said. The mov'd assistants melt in tears.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Then thus Ascanius, wonderstruck to see
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>That image of his filial piety:
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>"So great beginnings, in so green an age,
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Exact the faith which I again ingage.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>Thy mother all the dues shall justly claim,
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Creusa had, and only want the name.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Whate'er event thy bold attempt shall have,
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>'T is merit to have borne a son so brave.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Now by my head, a sacred oath, I swear,
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>(My father us'd it,) what, returning here
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Crown'd with success, I for thyself prepare,
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>That, if thou fail, shall thy lov'd mother share."
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>He said, and weeping, while he spoke the word,
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>From his broad belt he drew a shining sword,
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Magnificent with gold. Lycaon made,
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>And in an ivory scabbard sheath'd the blade.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>This was his gift. Great Mnestheus gave his friend
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>A lion's hide, his body to defend;
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>And good Alethes furnish'd him, beside,
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>With his own trusty helm, of temper tried.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Thus arm'd they went. The noble Trojans wait
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>Their issuing forth, and follow to the gate
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>With prayers and vows. Above the rest appears
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Ascanius, manly far beyond his years,
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>And messages committed to their care,
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>Which all in winds were lost, and flitting air.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>The trenches first they pass'd; then took their 
<A NAME="434"></A>way
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Where their proud foes in pitch'd pavilions lay;
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>To many fatal, ere themselves were slain.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>They found the careless host dispers'd upon the 
<A NAME="438"></A>plain,
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Who, gorg'd, and drunk with wine, supinely snore.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Unharness'd chariots stand along the shore:
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Amidst the wheels and reins, the goblet by,
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>A medley of debauch and war, they lie.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Observing Nisus shew'd his friend the sight:
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>"Behold a conquest gain'd without a fight.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Occasion offers, and I stand prepar'd;
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>There lies our way; be thou upon the guard,
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>And look around, while I securely go,
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>And hew a passage thro' the sleeping foe."
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>Softly he spoke; then striding took his way,
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>With his drawn sword, where haughty Rhamnes lay;
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>His head rais'd high on tapestry beneath,
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>And heaving from his breast, he drew his breath;
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>A king and prophet, by King Turnus lov'd:
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>But fate by prescience cannot be remov'd.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>Him and his sleeping slaves he slew; then spies
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Where Remus, with his rich retinue, lies.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>His armor-bearer first, and next he kills
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>His charioteer, intrench'd betwixt the wheels
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>And his lov'd horses; last invades their lord;
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword:
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>The gasping head flies off; a purple flood
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Flows from the trunk, that welters in the blood,
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>Which, by the spurning heels dispers'd around,
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>The bed besprinkles and bedews the ground.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Lamus the bold, and Lamyrus the strong,
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>He slew, and then Serranus fair and young.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>From dice and wine the youth retir'd to rest,
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>And puff'd the fumy god from out his breast:
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Ev'n then he dreamt of drink and lucky play-
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>More lucky, had it lasted till the day.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>The famish'd lion thus, with hunger bold,
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>O'erleaps the fences of the nightly fold,
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>And tears the peaceful flocks: with silent awe
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Trembling they lie, and pant beneath his paw.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Nor with less rage Euryalus employs
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>The wrathful sword, or fewer foes destroys;
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>But on th' ignoble crowd his fury flew;
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>He Fadus, Hebesus, and Rhoetus slew.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Oppress'd with heavy sleep the former fell,
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>But Rhoetus wakeful, and observing all:
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Behind a spacious jar he slink'd for fear;
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>The fatal iron found and reach'd him there;
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>For, as he rose, it pierc'd his naked side,
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>And, reeking, thence return'd in crimson dyed.
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>The wound pours out a stream of wine and blood;
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>The purple soul comes floating in the flood.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Now, where Messapus quarter'd, they arrive.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>The fires were fainting there, and just alive;
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>The warrior-horses, tied in order, fed.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Nisus observ'd the discipline, and said:
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>"Our eager thirst of blood may both betray;
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>And see the scatter'd streaks of dawning day,
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Foe to nocturnal thefts. No more, my friend;
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Here let our glutted execution end.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>A lane thro' slaughter'd bodies we have made."
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>The bold Euryalus, tho' loth, obey'd.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Of arms, and arras, and of plate, they find
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>A precious load; but these they leave behind.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Yet, fond of gaudy spoils, the boy would stay
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>To make the rich caparison his prey,
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Which on the steed of conquer'd Rhamnes lay.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Nor did his eyes less longingly behold
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>The girdle-belt, with nails of burnish'd gold.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>This present Caedicus the rich bestow'd
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>On Remulus, when friendship first they vow'd,
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>And, absent, join'd in hospitable ties:
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>He, dying, to his heir bequeath'd the prize;
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>Till, by the conqu'ring Ardean troops oppress'd,
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>He fell; and they the glorious gift possess'd.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>These glitt'ring spoils (now made the victor's gain)
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>He to his body suits, but suits in vain:
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Messapus' helm he finds among the rest,
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>And laces on, and wears the waving crest.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Proud of their conquest, prouder of their prey,
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>They leave the camp, and take the ready way.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>But far they had not pass'd, before they spied
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>Three hundred horse, with Volscens for their guide.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>The queen a legion to King Turnus sent;
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>But the swift horse the slower foot prevent,
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>And now, advancing, sought the leader's tent.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>They saw the pair; for, thro' the doubtful shade,
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>His shining helm Euryalus betray'd,
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>On which the moon with full reflection play'd.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>"'T is not for naught," cried Volscens from the 
<A NAME="525"></A>crowd,
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>"These men go there;" then rais'd his voice aloud:
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>"Stand! stand! why thus in arms? And whither bent?
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>From whence, to whom, and on what errand sent?"
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>Silent they scud away, and haste their flight
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>To neighb'ring woods, and trust themselves to night.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>The speedy horse all passages belay,
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>And spur their smoking steeds to cross their way,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>And watch each entrance of the winding wood.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>Black was the forest: thick with beech it stood,
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>Horrid with fern, and intricate with thorn;
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>Few paths of human feet, or tracks of beasts, were 
<A NAME="537"></A>worn.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>The darkness of the shades, his heavy prey,
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>And fear, misled the younger from his way.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>But Nisus hit the turns with happier haste,
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>And, thoughtless of his friend, the forest pass'd,
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>And Alban plains, from Alba's name so call'd,
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Where King Latinus then his oxen stall'd;
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Till, turning at the length, he stood his ground,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>And miss'd his friend, and cast his eyes around:
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>"Ah wretch!" he cried, "where have I left behind
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Th' unhappy youth? where shall I hope to find?
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Or what way take?" Again he ventures back,
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>And treads the mazes of his former track.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>He winds the wood, and, list'ning, hears the noise
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Of tramping coursers, and the riders' voice.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>The sound approach'd; and suddenly he view'd
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>The foes inclosing, and his friend pursued,
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Forelaid and taken, while he strove in vain
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>The shelter of the friendly shades to gain.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>What should he next attempt? what arms employ,
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>What fruitless force, to free the captive boy?
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>Or desperate should he rush and lose his life,
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>With odds oppress'd, in such unequal strife?
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>Resolv'd at length, his pointed spear he shook;
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>And, casting on the moon a mournful look:
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>"Guardian of groves, and goddess of the night,
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>Fair queen," he said, "direct my dart aright.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>If e'er my pious father, for my sake,
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Did grateful off'rings on thy altars make,
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Or I increas'd them with my sylvan toils,
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>And hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils,
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>Give me to scatter these." Then from his ear
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>He pois'd, and aim'd, and launch'd the trembling 
<A NAME="570"></A>spear.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>The deadly weapon, hissing from the grove,
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>Impetuous on the back of Sulmo drove;
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Pierc'd his thin armor, drank his vital blood,
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>And in his body left the broken
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>He staggers round; his eyeballs roll in death,
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>And with short sobs he gasps away his breath.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>All stand amaz'd- a second jav'lin flies
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>With equal strength, and quivers thro' the skies.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>This thro' thy temples, Tagus, forc'd the way,
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>And in the brainpan warmly buried lay.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Fierce Volscens foams with rage, and, gazing round,
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Descried not him who gave the fatal wound,
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Nor knew to fix revenge: "But thou," he cries,
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>"Shalt pay for both," and at the pris'ner flies
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>With his drawn sword. Then, struck with deep despair,
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>That cruel sight the lover could not bear;
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>But from his covert rush'd in open view,
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>And sent his voice before him as he flew:
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>"Me! me!" he cried- "turn all your swords alone
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>On me- the fact confess'd, the fault my own.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>He neither could nor durst, the guiltless youth:
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Ye moon and stars, bear witness to the truth!
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>His only crime (if friendship can offend)
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Is too much love to his unhappy friend."
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Too late he speaks: the sword, which fury guides,
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Driv'n with full force, had pierc'd his tender sides.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Down fell the beauteous youth: the yawning wound
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Gush'd out a purple stream, and stain'd the ground.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>His snowy neck reclines upon his breast,
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Like a fair flow'r by the keen share oppress'd;
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>Like a white poppy sinking on the plain,
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Whose heavy head is overcharg'd with rain.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>Despair, and rage, and vengeance justly vow'd,
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Drove Nisus headlong on the hostile crowd.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Volscens he seeks; on him alone he bends:
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Borne back and bor'd by his surrounding friends,
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>Onward he press'd, and kept him still in sight;
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>Then whirl'd aloft his sword with all his might:
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Th' unerring steel descended while he spoke,
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Piered his wide mouth, and thro' his weazon broke.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Dying, he slew; and, stagg'ring on the plain,
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>With swimming eyes he sought his lover slain;
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>Then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell,
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>Content, in death, to be reveng'd so well.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>O happy friends! for, if my verse can give
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>Immortal life, your fame shall ever live,
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Fix'd as the Capitol's foundation lies,
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>And spread, where'er the Roman eagle flies!
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>The conqu'ring party first divide the prey,
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Then their slain leader to the camp convey.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>With wonder, as they went, the troops were fill'd,
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>To see such numbers whom so few had kill'd.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>Serranus, Rhamnes, and the rest, they found:
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>Vast crowds the dying and the dead surround;
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>And the yet reeking blood o'erflows the ground.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>All knew the helmet which Messapus lost,
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>But mourn'd a purchase that so dear had cost.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>Now rose the ruddy morn from Tithon's bed,
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>And with the dawn of day the skies o'erspread;
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>Nor long the sun his daily course withheld,
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>But added colors to the world reveal'd:
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>When early Turnus, wak'ning with the light,
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>All clad in armor, calls his troops to fight.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>His martial men with fierce harangue he fir'd,
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>And his own ardor in their souls inspir'd.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>This done- to give new terror to his foes,
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>The heads of Nisus and his friend he shows,
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Rais'd high on pointed spears- a ghastly sight:
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Loud peals of shouts ensue, and barbarous delight.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Meantime the Trojans run, where danger calls;
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>They line their trenches, and they man their walls.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>In front extended to the left they stood;
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Safe was the right, surrounded by the flood.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>But, casting from their tow'rs a frightful view,
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>They saw the faces, which too well they knew,
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Tho' then disguis'd in death, and smear'd all o'er
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>With filth obscene, and dropping putrid gore.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Soon hasty fame thro' the sad city bears
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>The mournful message to the mother's ears.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>An icy cold benumbs her limbs; she shakes;
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>Her cheeks the blood, her hand the web forsakes.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>She runs the rampires round amidst the war,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Nor fears the flying darts; she rends her hair,
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>And fills with loud laments the liquid air.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>"Thus, then, my lov'd Euryalus appears!
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Thus looks the prop my declining years!
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>Was't on this face my famish'd eyes I fed?
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Ah! how unlike the living is the dead!
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>And could'st thou leave me, cruel, thus alone?
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>Not one kind kiss from a departing son!
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>No look, no last adieu before he went,
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>In an ill-boding hour to slaughter sent!
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>Cold on the ground, and pressing foreign clay,
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>To Latian dogs and fowls he lies a prey!
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Nor was I near to close his dying eyes,
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>To wash his wounds, to weep his obsequies,
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>To call about his corpse his crying friends,
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>Or spread the mantle (made for other ends)
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>On his dear body, which I wove with care,
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Nor did my daily pains or nightly labor spare.
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Where shall I find his corpse? what earth sustains
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>His trunk dismember'd, and his cold remains?
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>For this, alas! I left my needful ease,
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>Expos'd my life to winds and winter seas!
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>If any pity touch Rutulian hearts,
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>Here empty all your quivers, all your darts;
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>Or, if they fail, thou, Jove, conclude my woe,
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>And send me thunderstruck to shades below!"
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Her shrieks and clamors pierce the Trojans' ears,
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Unman their courage, and augment their fears;
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Nor young Ascanius could the sight sustain,
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Nor old Ilioneus his tears restrain,
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>But Actor and Idaeus jointly sent,
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>To bear the madding mother to her tent.
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>And now the trumpets terribly, from far,
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>With rattling clangor, rouse the sleepy war.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>The soldiers' shouts succeed the brazen sounds;
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>And heav'n, from pole to pole, the noise rebounds.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>The Volscians bear their shields upon their head,
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>And, rushing forward, form a moving shed.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>These fill the ditch; those pull the bulwarks down:
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>Some raise the ladders; others scale the town.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>But, where void spaces on the walls appear,
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Or thin defense, they pour their forces there.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>With poles and missive weapons, from afar,
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>The Trojans keep aloof the rising war.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Taught, by their ten years' siege, defensive fight,
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>They roll down ribs of rocks, an unresisted weight,
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>To break the penthouse with the pond'rous blow,
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>Which yet the patient Volscians undergo:
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>But could not bear th' unequal combat long;
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>For, where the Trojans find the thickest throng,
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>The ruin falls: their shatter'd shields give way,
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>And their crush'd heads become an easy prey.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>They shrink for fear, abated of their rage,
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>Nor longer dare in a blind fight engage;
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Contented now to gall them from below
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>With darts and slings, and with the distant bow.
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>Elsewhere Mezentius, terrible to view,
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>A blazing pine within the trenches threw.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>But brave Messapus, Neptune's warlike son,
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>Broke down the palisades, the trenches won,
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>And loud for ladders calls, to scale the town.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Calliope, begin! Ye sacred Nine,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>Inspire your poet in his high design,
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>To sing what slaughter manly Turnus made,
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>What souls he sent below the Stygian shade,
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>What fame the soldiers with their captain share,
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>And the vast circuit of the fatal war;
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>For you in singing martial facts excel;
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>You best remember, and alone can tell.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>There stood a tow'r, amazing to the sight,
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Built up of beams, and of stupendous height:
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>Art, and the nature of the place, conspir'd
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>To furnish all the strength that war requir'd.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>To level this, the bold Italians join;
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>The wary Trojans obviate their design;
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>With weighty stones o'erwhelm their troops below,
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>Shoot thro' the loopholes, and sharp jav'lins throw.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Turnus, the chief, toss'd from his thund'ring hand
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Against the wooden walls, a flaming brand:
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>It stuck, the fiery plague; the winds were high;
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>The planks were season'd, and the timber dry.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>Contagion caught the posts; it spread along,
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Scorch'd, and to distance drove the scatter'd throng.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>The Trojans fled; the fire pursued amain,
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>Still gath'ring fast upon the trembling train;
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>Till, crowding to the corners of the wall,
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>Down the defense and the defenders fall.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>The mighty flaw makes heav'n itself resound:
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>The dead and dying Trojans strew the ground.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>The tow'r, that follow'd on the fallen crew,
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>Whelm'd o'er their heads, and buried whom it slew:
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>Some stuck upon the darts themselves had sent;
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>All the same equal ruin underwent.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>Young Lycus and Helenor only scape;
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>Sav'd- how, they know not- from the steepy leap.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Helenor, elder of the two: by birth,
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>On one side royal, one a son of earth,
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>Whom to the Lydian king Licymnia bare,
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>And sent her boasted bastard to the war
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>(A privilege which none but freemen share).
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Slight were his arms, a sword and silver shield:
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>No marks of honor charg'd its empty field.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>Light as he fell, so light the youth arose,
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>And rising, found himself amidst his foes;
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Nor flight was left, nor hopes to force his way.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>Embolden'd by despair, he stood at bay;
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>And- like a stag, whom all the troop surrounds
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Of eager huntsmen and invading hounds-
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Resolv'd on death, he dissipates his fears,
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>And bounds aloft against the pointed spears:
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>So dares the youth, secure of death; and throws
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>His dying body on his thickest foes.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>But Lycus, swifter of his feet by far,
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>Runs, doubles, winds and turns, amidst the war;
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>Springs to the walls, and leaves his foes behind,
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>And snatches at the beam he first can find;
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Looks up, and leaps aloft at all the stretch,
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>In hopes the helping hand of some kind friend to 
<A NAME="771"></A>reach.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>But Turnus follow'd hard his hunted prey
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>(His spear had almost reach'd him in the way,
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>Short of his reins, and scarce a span behind)
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>"Fool!" said the chief, "tho' fleeter than the wind,
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>Couldst thou presume to scape, when I pursue?"
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>He said, and downward by the feet he drew
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>The trembling dastard; at the tug he falls;
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>Vast ruins come along, rent from the smoking walls.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>Thus on some silver swan, or tim'rous hare,
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>Jove's bird comes sousing down from upper air;
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>Her crooked talons truss the fearful prey:
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>Then out of sight she soars, and wings her way.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>So seizes the grim wolf the tender lamb,
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>In vain lamented by the bleating dam.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>Then rushing onward with a barb'rous cry,
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>The troops of Turnus to the combat fly.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>The ditch with fagots fill'd, the daring foe
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Toss'd firebrands to the steepy turrets throw.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>Ilioneus, as bold Lucetius came
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>To force the gate, and feed the kindling flame,
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>Roll'd down the fragment of a rock so right,
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>It crush'd him double underneath the weight.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>Two more young Liger and Asylas slew:
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>To bend the bow young Liger better knew;
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>Asylas best the pointed jav'lin threw.
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>Brave Caeneus laid Ortygius on the plain;
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>The victor Caeneus was by Turnus slain.
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>By the same hand, Clonius and Itys fall,
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>Sagar, and Ida, standing on the wall.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>From Capys' arms his fate Privernus found:
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Hurt by Themilla first-but slight the wound-
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>His shield thrown by, to mitigate the smart,
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>He clapp'd his hand upon the wounded part:
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>The second shaft came swift and unespied,
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>And pierc'd his hand, and nail'd it to his side,
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>Transfix'd his breathing lungs and beating heart:
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>The soul came issuing out, and hiss'd against the 
<A NAME="809"></A>dart.
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>The son of Arcens shone amid the rest,
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>In glitt'ring armor and a purple vest,
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>(Fair was his face, his eyes inspiring love,)
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>Bred by his father in the Martian grove,
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Where the fat altars of Palicus flame,
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>And send in arms to purchase early fame.
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>Him when he spied from far, the Tuscan king
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>Laid by the lance, and took him to the sling,
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>Thrice whirl'd the thong around his head, and threw:
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>The heated lead half melted as it flew;
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>It pierc'd his hollow temples and his brain;
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>The youth came tumbling down, and spurn'd the plain.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>Then young Ascanius, who, before this day,
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>Was wont in woods to shoot the savage prey,
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>First bent in martial strife the twanging bow,
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>And exercis'd against a human foe-
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>With this bereft Numanus of his life,
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>Who Turnus' younger sister took to wife.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>Proud of his realm, and of his royal bride,
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>Vaunting before his troops, and lengthen'd with a 
<A NAME="830"></A>stride,
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>In these insulting terms the Trojans he defied:
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>"Twice-conquer'd cowards, now your shame is shown-
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>Coop'd up a second time within your town!
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>Who dare not issue forth in open field,
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>But hold your walls before you for a shield.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>Thus threat you war? thus our alliance force?
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>What gods, what madness, hether steer'd your course?
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>You shall not find the sons of Atreus here,
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>Nor need the frauds of sly Ulysses fear.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Strong from the cradle, of a sturdy brood,
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>We bear our newborn infants to the flood;
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>There bath'd amid the stream, our boys we hold,
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>With winter harden'd, and inur'd to cold.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>They wake before the day to range the wood,
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>Kill ere they eat, nor taste unconquer'd food.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>No sports, but what belong to war, they know:
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>To break the stubborn colt, to bend the bow.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>Our youth, of labor patient, earn their bread;
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>Hardly they work, with frugal diet fed.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>From plows and harrows sent to seek renown,
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>They fight in fields, and storm the shaken town.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>No part of life from toils of war is free,
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>No change in age, or diff'rence in degree.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>We plow and till in arms; our oxen feel,
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>Instead of goads, the spur and pointed steel;
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>Th' inverted lance makes furrows in the plain.
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>Ev'n time, that changes all, yet changes us in vain:
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>The body, not the mind; nor can control
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>Th' immortal vigor, or abate the soul.
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>Our helms defend the young, disguise the gray:
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>We live by plunder, and delight in prey.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>Your vests embroider'd with rich purple shine;
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>In sloth you glory, and in dances join.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>Your vests have sweeping sleeves; with female pride
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>Your turbants underneath your chins are tied.
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>Go, Phrygians, to your Dindymus again!
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>Go, less than women, in the shapes of men!
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>Go, mix'd with eunuchs, in the Mother's rites,
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>Where with unequal sound the flute invites;
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>Sing, dance, and howl, by turns, in Ida's shade:
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>Resign the war to men, who know the martial trade!"
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>This foul reproach Ascanius could not hear
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>With patience, or a vow'd revenge forbear.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>At the full stretch of both his hands he drew,
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>And almost join'd the horns of the tough yew.
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>But, first, before the throne of Jove he stood,
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>And thus with lifted hands invok'd the god:
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>"My first attempt, great Jupiter, succeed!
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>An annual off'ring in thy grove shall bleed;
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>A snow-white steer, before thy altar led,
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>Who, like his mother, bears aloft his head,
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>Butts with his threat'ning brows, and bellowing 
<A NAME="883"></A>stands,
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>And dares the fight, and spurns the yellow sands."
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>Jove bow'd the heav'ns, and lent a gracious ear,
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>And thunder'd on the left, amidst the clear.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>Sounded at once the bow; and swiftly flies
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>The feather'd death, and hisses thro' the skies.
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>The steel thro' both his temples forc'd the way:
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>Extended on the ground, Numanus lay.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>"Go now, vain boaster, and true valor scorn!
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>The Phrygians, twice subdued, yet make this third 
<A NAME="893"></A>return."
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>Ascanius said no more. The Trojans shake
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>The heav'ns with shouting, and new vigor take.
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud,
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>To view the feats of arms, and fighting crowd;
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>And thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud:
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>"Advance, illustrious youth, increase in fame,
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>And wide from east to west extend thy name;
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>Offspring of gods thyself; and Rome shall owe
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>To thee a race of demigods below.
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>This is the way to heav'n: the pow'rs divine
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>From this beginning date the Julian line.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>To thee, to them, and their victorious heirs,
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>The conquer'd war is due, and the vast world is 
<A NAME="907"></A>theirs.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>Troy is too narrow for thy name." He said,
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>And plunging downward shot his radiant head;
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>Dispell'd the breathing air, that broke his flight:
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>Shorn of his beams, a man to mortal sight.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>Old Butes' form he took, Anchises' squire,
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>Now left, to rule Ascanius, by his sire:
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>His wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs,
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>His mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears,
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>And thus salutes the boy, too forward for his years:
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>"Suffice it thee, thy father's worthy son,
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>The warlike prize thou hast already won.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>The god of archers gives thy youth a part
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>Of his own praise, nor envies equal art.
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>Now tempt the war no more." He said, and flew
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>Obscure in air, and vanish'd from their view.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>The Trojans, by his arms, their patron know,
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>And hear the twanging of his heav'nly bow.
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>Then duteous force they use, and Phoebus' name,
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>To keep from fight the youth too fond of fame.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>Undaunted, they themselves no danger shun;
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>From wall to wall the shouts and clamors run.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>They bend their bows; they whirl their slings around;
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>Heaps of spent arrows fall, and strew the ground;
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>And helms, and shields, and rattling arms resound.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>The combat thickens, like the storm that flies
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>From westward, when the show'ry Kids arise;
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>Or patt'ring hail comes pouring on the main,
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>When Jupiter descends in harden'd rain,
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>Or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound,
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>And with an armed winter strew the ground.
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>Pand'rus and Bitias, thunderbolts of war,
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>Whom Hiera to bold Alcanor bare
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>On Ida's top, two youths of height and size
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>Like firs that on their mother mountain rise,
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>Presuming on their force, the gates unbar,
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>And of their own accord invite the war.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>With fates averse, against their king's command,
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>Arm'd, on the right and on the left they stand,
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>And flank the passage: shining steel they wear,
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>And waving crests above their heads appear.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>Thus two tall oaks, that Padus' banks adorn,
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>Lift up to heav'n their leafy heads unshorn,
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>And, overpress'd with nature's heavy load,
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>Dance to the whistling winds, and at each other 
<A NAME="952"></A>nod.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>In flows a tide of Latians, when they see
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>The gate set open, and the passage free;
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>Bold Quercens, with rash Tmarus, rushing on,
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>Equicolus, that in bright armor shone,
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>And Haemon first; but soon repuls'd they fly,
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>Or in the well-defended pass they die.
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>These with success are fir'd, and those with rage,
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>And each on equal terms at length ingage.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>Drawn from their lines, and issuing on the plain,
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>The Trojans hand to hand the fight maintain.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>Fierce Turnus in another quarter fought,
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>When suddenly th' unhop'd-for news was brought,
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>The foes had left the fastness of their place,
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>Prevail'd in fight, and had his men in chase.
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>He quits th' attack, and, to prevent their fate,
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>Runs where the giant brothers guard the gate.
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>The first he met, Antiphates the brave,
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>But base-begotten on a Theban slave,
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>Sarpedon's son, he slew: the deadly dart
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>Found passage thro' his breast, and pierc'd his 
<A NAME="973"></A>heart.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>Fix'd in the wound th' Italian cornel stood,
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>Warm'd in his lungs, and in his vital blood.
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>Aphidnus next, and Erymanthus dies,
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>And Meropes, and the gigantic size
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>Of Bitias, threat'ning with his ardent eyes.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>Not by the feeble dart he fell oppress'd
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>(A dart were lost within that roomy breast),
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>But from a knotted lance, large, heavy, strong,
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>Which roar'd like thunder as it whirl'd along:
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>Not two bull hides th' impetuous force withhold,
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>Nor coat of double mail, with scales of gold.
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>Down sunk the monster bulk and press'd the ground;
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>His arms and clatt'ring shield on the vast body 
<A NAME="987"></A>sound,
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>Not with less ruin than the Bajan mole,
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>Rais'd on the seas, the surges to control-
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>At once comes tumbling down the rocky wall;
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>Prone to the deep, the stones disjointed fall
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>Of the vast pile; the scatter'd ocean flies;
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>Black sands, discolor'd froth, and mingled mud arise:
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>The frighted billows roll, and seek the shores;
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>Then trembles Prochyta, then Ischia roars:
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>Typhoeus, thrown beneath, by Jove's command,
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>Astonish'd at the flaw that shakes the land,
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>Soon shifts his weary side, and, scarce awake,
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>With wonder feels the weight press lighter on his 
<A NAME="1000"></A>back.
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>The warrior god the Latian troops inspir'd,
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>New strung their sinews, and their courage fir'd,
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>But chills the Trojan hearts with cold affright:
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>Then black despair precipitates their flight.
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>When Pandarus beheld his brother kill'd,
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>The town with fear and wild confusion fill'd,
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>He turns the hinges of the heavy gate
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>With both his hands, and adds his shoulders to the 
<A NAME="1009"></A>weight
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>Some happier friends within the walls inclos'd;
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>The rest shut out, to certain death expos'd:
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>Fool as he was, and frantic in his care,
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>T' admit young Turnus, and include the war!
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>He thrust amid the crowd, securely bold,
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>Like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold.
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>Too late his blazing buckler they descry,
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>And sparkling fires that shot from either eye,
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>His mighty members, and his ample breast,
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>His rattling armor, and his crimson crest.
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>Far from that hated face the Trojans fly,
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>All but the fool who sought his destiny.
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>Mad Pandarus steps forth, with vengeance vow'd
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>For Bitias' death, and threatens thus aloud:
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>"These are not Ardea's walls, nor this the town
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>Amata proffers with Lavinia's crown:
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>'T is hostile earth you tread. Of hope bereft,
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>No means of safe return by flight are left."
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>To whom, with count'nance calm, and soul sedate,
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>Thus Turnus: "Then begin, and try thy fate:
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>My message to the ghost of Priam bear;
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>Tell him a new Achilles sent thee there."
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>A lance of tough ground ash the Trojan threw,
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>Rough in the rind, and knotted as it grew:
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>With his full force he whirl'd it first around;
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>But the soft yielding air receiv'd the wound:
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>Imperial Juno turn'd the course before,
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>And fix'd the wand'ring weapon in the door.
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>"But hope not thou," said Turnus, "when I strike,
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>To shun thy fate: our force is not alike,
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>Nor thy steel temper'd by the Lemnian god."
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>Then rising, on his utmost stretch he stood,
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>And aim'd from high: the full descending blow
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>Cleaves the broad front and beardless cheeks in 
<A NAME="1044"></A>two.
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>Down sinks the giant with a thund'ring sound:
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>His pond'rous limbs oppress the trembling ground;
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>Blood, brains, and foam gush from the gaping wound:
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>Scalp, face, and shoulders the keen steel divides,
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>And the shar'd visage hangs on equal sides.
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>The Trojans fly from their approaching fate;
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>And, had the victor then secur'd the gate,
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>And to his troops without unclos'd the bars,
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>One lucky day had ended all his wars.
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>But boiling youth, and blind desire of blood,
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>Push'd on his fury, to pursue the crowd.
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>Hamstring'd behind, unhappy Gyges died;
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>Then Phalaris is added to his side.
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>The pointed jav'lins from the dead he drew,
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>And their friends' arms against their fellows threw.
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>Strong Halys stands in vain; weak Phlegys flies;
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>Saturnia, still at hand, new force and fire supplies.
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>Then Halius, Prytanis, Alcander fall-
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>Ingag'd against the foes who scal'd the wall:
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>But, whom they fear'd without, they found within.
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>At last, tho' late, by Lynceus he was seen.
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>He calls new succors, and assaults the prince:
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>But weak his force, and vain is their defense.
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>Turn'd to the right, his sword the hero drew,
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>And at one blow the bold aggressor slew.
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>He joints the neck; and, with a stroke so strong,
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>The helm flies off, and bears the head along.
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>Next him, the huntsman Amycus he kill'd,
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>In darts invenom'd and in poison skill'd.
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>Then Clytius fell beneath his fatal spear,
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>And Creteus, whom the Muses held so dear:
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>He fought with courage, and he sung the fight;
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>Arms were his bus'ness, verses his delight.
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>The Trojan chiefs behold, with rage and grief,
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>Their slaughter'd friends, and hasten their relief.
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>Bold Mnestheus rallies first the broken train,
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>Whom brave Seresthus and his troop sustain.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>To save the living, and revenge the dead,
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>Against one warrior's arms all Troy they led.
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>"O, void of sense and courage!" Mnestheus cried,
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>"Where can you hope your coward heads to hide?
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>Ah! where beyond these rampires can you run?
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>One man, and in your camp inclos'd, you shun!
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>Shall then a single sword such slaughter boast,
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>And pass unpunish'd from a num'rous host?
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>Forsaking honor, and renouncing fame,
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>Your gods, your country, and your king you shame!"
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>This just reproach their virtue does excite:
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>They stand, they join, they thicken to the fight.
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>Now Turnus doubts, and yet disdains to yield,
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>But with slow paces measures back the field,
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>And inches to the walls, where Tiber's tide,
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>Washing the camp, defends the weaker side.
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>The more he loses, they advance the more,
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>And tread in ev'ry step he trod before.
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>They shout: they bear him back; and, whom by might
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>They cannot conquer, they oppress with weight.
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>As, compass'd with a wood of spears around,
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>The lordly lion still maintains his ground;
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>Grins horrible, retires, and turns again;
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>Threats his distended paws, and shakes his mane;
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>He loses while in vain he presses on,
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>Nor will his courage let him dare to run:
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>So Turnus fares, and, unresolved of flight,
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>Moves tardy back, and just recedes from fight.
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>Yet twice, inrag'd, the combat he renews,
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>Twice breaks, and twice his broken foes pursues.
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>But now they swarm, and, with fresh troops supplied,
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>Come rolling on, and rush from ev'ry side:
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>Nor Juno, who sustain'd his arms before,
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>Dares with new strength suffice th' exhausted store;
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>For Jove, with sour commands, sent Iris down,
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>To force th' invader from the frighted town.
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>With labor spent, no longer can he wield
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>The heavy fanchion, or sustain the shield,
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>O'erwhelm'd with darts, which from afar they fling:
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>The weapons round his hollow temples ring;
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>His golden helm gives way, with stony blows
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>Batter'd, and flat, and beaten to his brows.
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>His crest is rash'd away; his ample shield
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>Is falsified, and round with jav'lins fill'd.
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>The foe, now faint, the Trojans overwhelm;
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>And Mnestheus lays hard load upon his helm.
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>Sick sweat succeeds; he drops at ev'ry pore;
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>With driving dust his cheeks are pasted o'er;
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>Shorter and shorter ev'ry gasp he takes;
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>And vain efforts and hurtless blows he makes.
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>Plung'd in the flood, and made the waters fly.
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>The yellow god the welcome burthen bore,
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>And wip'd the sweat, and wash'd away the gore;
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR>Then gently wafts him to the farther coast,
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>And sends him safe to cheer his anxious host.
