<A NAME="10"></A>Thee too, great Pales, will I hymn, and thee,
<A NAME="11"></A><BR>Amphrysian shepherd, worthy to be sung,
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>You, woods and waves Lycaean. All themes beside,
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Which else had charmed the vacant mind with song,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>Are now waxed common. Of harsh Eurystheus who
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>The story knows not, or that praiseless king
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Busiris, and his altars? or by whom
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Hath not the tale been told of Hylas young,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Latonian Delos and Hippodame,
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>And Pelops for his ivory shoulder famed,
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Keen charioteer? Needs must a path be tried,
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>By which I too may lift me from the dust,
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>And float triumphant through the mouths of men.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Yea, I shall be the first, so life endure,
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>To lead the Muses with me, as I pass
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>To mine own country from the Aonian height;
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>I, Mantua, first will bring thee back the palms
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Of Idumaea, and raise a marble shrine
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>On thy green plain fast by the water-side,
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Where Mincius winds more vast in lazy coils,
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>And rims his margent with the tender reed.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Amid my shrine shall Caesar's godhead dwell.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>To him will I, as victor, bravely dight
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>In Tyrian purple, drive along the bank
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>A hundred four-horse cars. All Greece for me,
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Leaving Alpheus and Molorchus' grove,
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>On foot shall strive, or with the raw-hide glove;
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Whilst I, my head with stripped green olive crowned,
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Will offer gifts. Even 'tis present joy
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>To lead the high processions to the fane,
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>And view the victims felled; or how the scene
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Sunders with shifted face, and Britain's sons
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Inwoven thereon with those proud curtains rise.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Of gold and massive ivory on the doors
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>I'll trace the battle of the Gangarides,
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>And our Quirinus' conquering arms, and there
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Surging with war, and hugely flowing, the Nile,
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>And columns heaped on high with naval brass.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>And Asia's vanquished cities I will add,
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>And quelled Niphates, and the Parthian foe,
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Who trusts in flight and backward-volleying darts,
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>And trophies torn with twice triumphant hand
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>From empires twain on ocean's either shore.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>And breathing forms of Parian marble there
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Shall stand, the offspring of Assaracus,
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>And great names of the Jove-descended folk,
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>And father Tros, and Troy's first founder, lord
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>Of Cynthus. And accursed Envy there
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Shall dread the Furies, and thy ruthless flood,
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>Cocytus, and Ixion's twisted snakes,
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>And that vast wheel and ever-baffling stone.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>Meanwhile the Dryad-haunted woods and lawns
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Unsullied seek we; 'tis thy hard behest,
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><B>Maecenas.</B> Without thee no lofty task
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>My mind essays. Up! break the sluggish bonds
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Of tarriance; with loud din Cithaeron calls,
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Steed-taming Epidaurus, and thy hounds,
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Taygete; and hark! the assenting groves
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>With peal on peal reverberate the roar.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Yet must I gird me to rehearse ere long
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>The fiery fights of Caesar, speed his name
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Through ages, countless as to Caesar's self
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>From the first birth-dawn of Tithonus old.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>If eager for the prized Olympian palm
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>One breed the horse, or bullock strong to plough,
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Be his prime care a shapely dam to choose.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Of kine grim-faced is goodliest, with coarse head
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>And burly neck, whose hanging dewlaps reach
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>From chin to knee; of boundless length her flank;
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Large every way she is, large-footed even,
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>With incurved horns and shaggy ears beneath.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Nor let mislike me one with spots of white
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Conspicuous, or that spurns the yoke, whose horn
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>At times hath vice in't: liker bull-faced she,
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>And tall-limbed wholly, and with tip of tail
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Brushing her footsteps as she walks along.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>The age for Hymen's rites, Lucina's pangs,
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Ere ten years ended, after four begins;
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>Their residue of days nor apt to teem,
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Nor strong for ploughing. Meantime, while youth's 
<A NAME="90"></A>delight
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Survives within them, loose the males: be first
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>To speed thy herds of cattle to their loves,
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Breed stock with stock, and keep the race supplied.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>Ah! life's best hours are ever first to fly
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>From hapless mortals; in their place succeed
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>Disease and dolorous eld; till travail sore
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>And death unpitying sweep them from the scene.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Still will be some, whose form thou fain wouldst 
<A NAME="99"></A>change;
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Renew them still; with yearly choice of young
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Preventing losses, lest too late thou rue.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Nor steeds crave less selection; but on those
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Thou think'st to rear, the promise of their line,
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>From earliest youth thy chiefest pains bestow.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>See from the first yon high-bred colt afield,
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>His lofty step, his limbs' elastic tread:
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Dauntless he leads the herd, still first to try
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>The threatening flood, or brave the unknown bridge,
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>By no vain noise affrighted; lofty-necked,
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>With clean-cut head, short belly, and stout back;
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>His sprightly breast exuberant with brawn.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Chestnut and grey are good; the worst-hued white
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>And sorrel. Then lo! if arms are clashed afar,
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Bide still he cannot: ears stiffen and limbs quake;
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>His nostrils snort and roll out wreaths of fire.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Dense is his mane, that when uplifted falls
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>On his right shoulder; betwixt either loin
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>The spine runs double; his earth-dinting hoof
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Rings with the ponderous beat of solid horn.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Even such a horse was Cyllarus, reined and tamed
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>By Pollux of Amyclae; such the pair
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>In Grecian song renowned, those steeds of Mars,
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>And famed Achilles' team: in such-like form
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Great Saturn's self with mane flung loose on neck
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Sped at his wife's approach, and flying filled
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>The heights of Pelion with his piercing neigh.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Even him, when sore disease or sluggish eld
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Now saps his strength, pen fast at home, and spare
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>His not inglorious age. A horse grown old
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Slow kindling unto love in vain prolongs
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>The fruitless task, and, to the encounter come,
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>As fire in stubble blusters without strength,
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>He rages idly. Therefore mark thou first
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Their age and mettle, other points anon,
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>As breed and lineage, or what pain was theirs
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>To lose the race, what pride the palm to win.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>Seest how the chariots in mad rivalry
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>Poured from the barrier grip the course and go,
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>When youthful hope is highest, and every heart
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>Drained with each wild pulsation? How they ply
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>The circling lash, and reaching forward let
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>The reins hang free! Swift spins the glowing wheel;
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>And now they stoop, and now erect in air
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Seem borne through space and towering to the sky:
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>No stop, no stay; the dun sand whirls aloft;
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>They reek with foam-flakes and pursuing breath;
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>So sweet is fame, so prized the victor's palm.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>'Twas Ericthonius first took heart to yoke
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Four horses to his car, and rode above
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>The whirling wheels to victory: but the ring
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>And bridle-reins, mounted on horses' backs,
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>The Pelethronian Lapithae bequeathed,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>And taught the knight in arms to spurn the ground,
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>And arch the upgathered footsteps of his pride.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Each task alike is arduous, and for each
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>A horse young, fiery, swift of foot, they seek;
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>How oft so-e'er yon rival may have chased
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>The flying foe, or boast his native plain
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Epirus, or Mycenae's stubborn hold,
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>And trace his lineage back to Neptune's birth.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>These points regarded, as the time draws nigh,
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>With instant zeal they lavish all their care
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>To plump with solid fat the chosen chief
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>And designated husband of the herd:
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>And flowery herbs they cut, and serve him well
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>With corn and running water, that his strength
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>Not fail him for that labour of delight,
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>Nor puny colts betray the feeble sire.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>The herd itself of purpose they reduce
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>To leanness, and when love's sweet longing first
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Provokes them, they forbid the leafy food,
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>And pen them from the springs, and oft beside
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>With running shake, and tire them in the sun,
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>What time the threshing-floor groans heavily
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>With pounding of the corn-ears, and light chaff
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Is whirled on high to catch the rising west.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>This do they that the soil's prolific powers
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>May not be dulled by surfeiting, nor choke
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>The sluggish furrows, but eagerly absorb
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Their fill of love, and deeply entertain.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>To care of sire the mother's care succeeds.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>When great with young they wander nigh their time,
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>Let no man suffer them to drag the yoke
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>In heavy wains, nor leap across the way,
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Nor scour the meads, nor swim the rushing flood.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>In lonely lawns they feed them, by the course
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Of brimming streams, where moss is, and the banks
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>With grass are greenest, where are sheltering caves,
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>And far outstretched the rock-flung shadow lies.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Round wooded Silarus and the ilex-bowers
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Of green Alburnus swarms a winged pest-
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Its Roman name Asilus, by the Greeks
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Termed Oestros- fierce it is, and harshly hums,
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Driving whole herds in terror through the groves,
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Till heaven is madded by their bellowing din,
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>And Tanager's dry bed and forest-banks.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>With this same scourge did Juno wreak of old
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>The terrors of her wrath, a plague devised
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Against the heifer sprung from Inachus.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>From this too thou, since in the noontide heats
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>'Tis most persistent, fend thy teeming herds,
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>And feed them when the sun is newly risen,
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Or the first stars are ushering in the night.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>But, yeaning ended, all their tender care
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Is to the calves transferred; at once with marks
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>They brand them, both to designate their race,
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>And which to rear for breeding, or devote
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>As altar-victims, or to cleave the ground
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>And into ridges tear and turn the sod.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>The rest along the greensward graze at will.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>Those that to rustic uses thou wouldst mould,
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>As calves encourage and take steps to tame,
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>While pliant wills and plastic youth allow.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>And first of slender withies round the throat
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Loose collars hang, then when their free-born necks
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Are used to service, with the self-same bands
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Yoke them in pairs, and steer by steer compel
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Keep pace together. And time it is that oft
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Unfreighted wheels be drawn along the ground
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Behind them, as to dint the surface-dust;
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Then let the beechen axle strain and creak
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>'Neath some stout burden, whilst a brazen pole
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>Drags on the wheels made fast thereto. Meanwhile
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>For their unbroken youth not grass alone,
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>Nor meagre willow-leaves and marish-sedge,
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>But corn-ears with thy hand pluck from the crops.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Nor shall the brood-kine, as of yore, for thee
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>Brim high the snowy milking-pail, but spend
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Their udders' fullness on their own sweet young.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>But if fierce squadrons and the ranks of war
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Delight thee rather, or on wheels to glide
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>At Pisa, with Alpheus fleeting by,
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>And in the grove of Jupiter urge on
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>The flying chariot, be your steed's first task
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>To face the warrior's armed rage, and brook
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>The trumpet, and long roar of rumbling wheels,
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>And clink of chiming bridles in the stall;
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>Then more and more to love his master's voice
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Caressing, or loud hand that claps his neck.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Ay, thus far let him learn to dare, when first
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Weaned from his mother, and his mouth at times
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Yield to the supple halter, even while yet
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Weak, tottering-limbed, and ignorant of life.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>But, three years ended, when the fourth arrives,
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Now let him tarry not to run the ring
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>With rhythmic hoof-beat echoing, and now learn
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Alternately to curve each bending leg,
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>And be like one that struggleth; then at last
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Challenge the winds to race him, and at speed
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Launched through the open, like a reinless thing,
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Scarce print his footsteps on the surface-sand.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>As when with power from Hyperborean climes
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>The north wind stoops, and scatters from his path
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Dry clouds and storms of Scythia; the tall corn
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>And rippling plains 'gin shiver with light gusts;
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>A sound is heard among the forest-tops;
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Long waves come racing shoreward: fast he flies,
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>With instant pinion sweeping earth and main.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>A steed like this or on the mighty course
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>Of Elis at the goal will sweat, and shower
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Red foam-flakes from his mouth, or, kindlier task,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>With patient neck support the Belgian car.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Then, broken at last, let swell their burly frame
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>With fattening corn-mash, for, unbroke, they will
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>With pride wax wanton, and, when caught, refuse
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>Tough lash to brook or jagged curb obey.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>But no device so fortifies their power
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>As love's blind stings of passion to forefend,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Whether on steed or steer thy choice be set.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>Ay, therefore 'tis they banish bulls afar
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>To solitary pastures, or behind
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Some mountain-barrier, or broad streams beyond,
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Or else in plenteous stalls pen fast at home.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>For, even through sight of her, the female wastes
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>His strength with smouldering fire, till he forget
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>Both grass and woodland. She indeed full oft
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>With her sweet charms can lovers proud compel
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>To battle for the conquest horn to horn.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>In Sila's forest feeds the heifer fair,
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>While each on each the furious rivals run;
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Wound follows wound; the black blood laves their 
<A NAME="282"></A>limbs;
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Horns push and strive against opposing horns,
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>With mighty groaning; all the forest-side
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>And far Olympus bellow back the roar.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Nor wont the champions in one stall to couch;
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>But he that's worsted hies him to strange climes
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Far off, an exile, moaning much the shame,
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>The blows of that proud conqueror, then love's loss
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Avenged not; with one glance toward the byre,
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>His ancient royalties behind him lie.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>So with all heed his strength he practiseth,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>And nightlong makes the hard bare stones his bed,
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>And feeds on prickly leaf and pointed rush,
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>And proves himself, and butting at a tree
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Learns to fling wrath into his horns, with blows
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>Provokes the air, and scattering clouds of sand
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Makes prelude of the battle; afterward,
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>With strength repaired and gathered might breaks 
<A NAME="300"></A>camp,
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>And hurls him headlong on the unthinking foe:
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>As in mid ocean when a wave far of
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>Begins to whiten, mustering from the main
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>Its rounded breast, and, onward rolled to land
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Falls with prodigious roar among the rocks,
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>Huge as a very mountain: but the depths
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Upseethe in swirling eddies, and disgorge
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>The murky sand-lees from their sunken bed.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Nay, every race on earth of men, and beasts,
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>And ocean-folk, and flocks, and painted birds,
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Rush to the raging fire: love sways them all.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Never than then more fiercely o'er the plain
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>Prowls heedless of her whelps the lioness:
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Nor monstrous bears such wide-spread havoc-doom
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>Deal through the forests; then the boar is fierce,
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Most deadly then the tigress: then, alack!
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Ill roaming is it on Libya's lonely plains.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Mark you what shivering thrills the horse's frame,
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>If but a waft the well-known gust conveys?
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Nor curb can check them then, nor lash severe,
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Nor rocks and caverned crags, nor barrier-floods,
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>That rend and whirl and wash the hills away.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Then speeds amain the great Sabellian boar,
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>His tushes whets, with forefoot tears the ground,
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Rubs 'gainst a tree his flanks, and to and fro
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Hardens each wallowing shoulder to the wound.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>What of the youth, when love's relentless might
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Stirs the fierce fire within his veins? Behold!
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>In blindest midnight how he swims the gulf
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Convulsed with bursting storm-clouds! Over him
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Heaven's huge gate thunders; the rock-shattered 
<A NAME="332"></A>main
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>Utters a warning cry; nor parents' tears
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Can backward call him, nor the maid he loves,
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Too soon to die on his untimely pyre.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>What of the spotted ounce to Bacchus dear,
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Or warlike wolf-kin or the breed of dogs?
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Why tell how timorous stags the battle join?
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>O'er all conspicuous is the rage of mares,
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>By Venus' self inspired of old, what time
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>The Potnian four with rending jaws devoured
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>The limbs of Glaucus. Love-constrained they roam
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Past Gargarus, past the loud Ascanian flood;
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>They climb the mountains, and the torrents swim;
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>And when their eager marrow first conceives
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>The fire, in Spring-tide chiefly, for with Spring
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>Warmth doth their frames revisit, then they stand
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>All facing westward on the rocky heights,
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>And of the gentle breezes take their fill;
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>And oft unmated, marvellous to tell,
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>But of the wind impregnate, far and wide
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>O'er craggy height and lowly vale they scud,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Not toward thy rising, Eurus, or the sun's,
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>But westward and north-west, or whence up-springs
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Black Auster, that glooms heaven with rainy cold.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Hence from their groin slow drips a poisonous juice,
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>By shepherds truly named hippomanes,
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Hippomanes, fell stepdames oft have culled,
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>And mixed with herbs and spells of baneful bode.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Fast flies meanwhile the irreparable hour,
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>As point to point our charmed round we trace.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Enough of herds. This second task remains,
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>The wool-clad flocks and shaggy goats to treat.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Here lies a labour; hence for glory look,
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Brave husbandmen. Nor doubtfully know
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>How hard it is for words to triumph here,
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>And shed their lustre on a theme so slight:
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>But I am caught by ravishing desire
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>Above the lone Parnassian steep; I love
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>To walk the heights, from whence no earlier track
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Slopes gently downward to Castalia's spring.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>Now, awful Pales, strike a louder tone.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>First, for the sheep soft pencotes I decree
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>To browse in, till green summer's swift return;
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>And that the hard earth under them with straw
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>And handfuls of the fern be littered deep,
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Lest chill of ice such tender cattle harm
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>With scab and loathly foot-rot. Passing thence
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>I bid the goats with arbute-leaves be stored,
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>And served with fresh spring-water, and their pens
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Turned southward from the blast, to face the suns
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Of winter, when Aquarius' icy beam
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Now sinks in showers upon the parting year.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>These too no lightlier our protection claim,
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Nor prove of poorer service, howsoe'er
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Milesian fleeces dipped in Tyrian reds
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Repay the barterer; these with offspring teem
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>More numerous; these yield plenteous store of milk:
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>The more each dry-wrung udder froths the pail,
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>More copious soon the teat-pressed torrents flow.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>Ay, and on Cinyps' bank the he-goats too
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Their beards and grizzled chins and bristling hair
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Let clip for camp-use, or as rugs to wrap
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>Seafaring wretches. But they browse the woods
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>And summits of Lycaeus, and rough briers,
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>And brakes that love the highland: of themselves
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Right heedfully the she-goats homeward troop
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Before their kids, and with plump udders clogged
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Scarce cross the threshold. Wherefore rather ye,
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>The less they crave man's vigilance, be fain
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>From ice to fend them and from snowy winds;
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>Bring food and feast them with their branchy fare,
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Nor lock your hay-loft all the winter long.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>But when glad summer at the west wind's call
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>Sends either flock to pasture in the glades,
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Soon as the day-star shineth, hie we then
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>To the cool meadows, while the dawn is young,
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>The grass yet hoary, and to browsing herds
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>The dew tastes sweetest on the tender sward.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>When heaven's fourth hour draws on the thickening 
<A NAME="411"></A>drought,
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>And shrill cicalas pierce the brake with song,
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Then at the well-springs bid them, or deep pools,
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>From troughs of holm-oak quaff the running wave:
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>But at day's hottest seek a shadowy vale,
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>Where some vast ancient-timbered oak of Jove
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Spreads his huge branches, or where huddling black
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>Ilex on ilex cowers in awful shade.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Then once more give them water sparingly,
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>And feed once more, till sunset, when cool eve
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Allays the air, and dewy moonbeams slake
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>The forest glades, with halcyon's song the shore,
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>And every thicket with the goldfinch rings.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Of Libya's shepherds why the tale pursue?
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Why sing their pastures and the scattered huts
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>They house in? Oft their cattle day and night
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Graze the whole month together, and go forth
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>Into far deserts where no shelter is,
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>So flat the plain and boundless. All his goods
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>The Afric swain bears with him, house and home,
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Arms, Cretan quiver, and Amyclaean dog;
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>As some keen Roman in his country's arms
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Plies the swift march beneath a cruel load;
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Soon with tents pitched and at his post he stands,
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Ere looked for by the foe. Not thus the tribes
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Of Scythia by the far Maeotic wave,
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Where turbid Ister whirls his yellow sands,
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>And Rhodope stretched out beneath the pole
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Comes trending backward. There the herds they keep
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Close-pent in byres, nor any grass is seen
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Upon the plain, nor leaves upon the tree:
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>But with snow-ridges and deep frost afar
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Heaped seven ells high the earth lies featureless:
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Still winter? still the north wind's icy breath!
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>Nay, never sun disparts the shadows pale,
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Or as he rides the steep of heaven, or dips
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>In ocean's fiery bath his plunging car.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Quick ice-crusts curdle on the running stream,
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>And iron-hooped wheels the water's back now bears,
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>To broad wains opened, as erewhile to ships;
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Brass vessels oft asunder burst, and clothes
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Stiffen upon the wearers; juicy wines
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>They cleave with axes; to one frozen mass
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Whole pools are turned; and on their untrimmed beards
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>Stiff clings the jagged icicle. Meanwhile
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>All heaven no less is filled with falling snow;
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>The cattle perish: oxen's mighty frames
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Stand island-like amid the frost, and stags
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>In huddling herds, by that strange weight benumbed,
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Scarce top the surface with their antler-points.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>These with no hounds they hunt, nor net with toils,
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Nor scare with terror of the crimson plume;
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>But, as in vain they breast the opposing block,
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Butcher them, knife in hand, and so dispatch
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Loud-bellowing, and with glad shouts hale them home.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>Themselves in deep-dug caverns underground
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Dwell free and careless; to their hearths they heave
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Oak-logs and elm-trees whole, and fire them there,
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>There play the night out, and in festive glee
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>With barm and service sour the wine-cup mock.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>So 'neath the seven-starred Hyperborean wain
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>The folk live tameless, buffeted with blasts
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Of Eurus from Rhipaean hills, and wrap
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>Their bodies in the tawny fells of beasts.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>If wool delight thee, first, be far removed
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>All prickly boskage, burrs and caltrops; shun
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Luxuriant pastures; at the outset choose
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>White flocks with downy fleeces. For the ram,
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>How white soe'er himself, be but the tongue
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>'Neath his moist palate black, reject him, lest
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>He sully with dark spots his offspring's fleece,
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>And seek some other o'er the teeming plain.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Even with such snowy bribe of wool, if ear
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>May trust the tale, Pan, God of Arcady,
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Snared and beguiled thee, Luna, calling thee
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>To the deep woods; nor thou didst spurn his call.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>But who for milk hath longing, must himself
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>Carry lucerne and lotus-leaves enow
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>With salt herbs to the cote, whence more they love
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>The streams, more stretch their udders, and give 
<A NAME="491"></A>back
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>A subtle taste of saltness in the milk.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Many there be who from their mothers keep
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>The new-born kids, and straightway bind their mouths
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>With iron-tipped muzzles. What they milk at dawn,
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Or in the daylight hours, at night they press;
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>What darkling or at sunset, this ere morn
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>They bear away in baskets- for to town
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>The shepherd hies him- or with dash of salt
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Just sprinkle, and lay by for winter use.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Nor be thy dogs last cared for; but alike
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Swift Spartan hounds and fierce Molossian feed
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>On fattening whey. Never, with these to watch,
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>Dread nightly thief afold and ravening wolves,
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Or Spanish desperadoes in the rear.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>And oft the shy wild asses thou wilt chase,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>With hounds, too, hunt the hare, with hounds the 
<A NAME="508"></A>doe;
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Oft from his woodland wallowing-den uprouse
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>The boar, and scare him with their baying, and drive,
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>And o'er the mountains urge into the toils
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Some antlered monster to their chiming cry.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Learn also scented cedar-wood to burn
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Within the stalls, and snakes of noxious smell
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>With fumes of galbanum to drive away.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Oft under long-neglected cribs, or lurks
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>A viper ill to handle, that hath fled
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>The light in terror, or some snake, that wont
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>'Neath shade and sheltering roof to creep, and shower
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Its bane among the cattle, hugs the ground,
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Fell scourge of kine. Shepherd, seize stakes, seize 
<A NAME="522"></A>stones!
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>And as he rears defiance, and puffs out
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>A hissing throat, down with him! see how low
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>That cowering crest is vailed in flight, the while,
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>His midmost coils and final sweep of tail
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Relaxing, the last fold drags lingering spires.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Then that vile worm that in Calabrian glades
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>Uprears his breast, and wreathes a scaly back,
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>His length of belly pied with mighty spots-
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>While from their founts gush any streams, while 
<A NAME="532"></A>yet
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>With showers of Spring and rainy south-winds earth
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>Is moistened, lo! he haunts the pools, and here
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>Housed in the banks, with fish and chattering frogs
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>Crams the black void of his insatiate maw.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>Soon as the fens are parched, and earth with heat
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Is gaping, forth he darts into the dry,
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Rolls eyes of fire and rages through the fields,
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>Furious from thirst and by the drought dismayed.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>Me list not then beneath the open heaven
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>To snatch soft slumber, nor on forest-ridge
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Lie stretched along the grass, when, slipped his 
<A NAME="544"></A>slough,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>To glittering youth transformed he winds his spires,
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>And eggs or younglings leaving in his lair,
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Towers sunward, lightening with three-forked tongue.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Of sickness, too, the causes and the signs
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>I'll teach thee. Loathly scab assails the sheep,
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>When chilly showers have probed them to the quick,
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>And winter stark with hoar-frost, or when sweat
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Unpurged cleaves to them after shearing done,
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>And rough thorns rend their bodies. Hence it is
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Shepherds their whole flock steep in running streams,
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>While, plunged beneath the flood, with drenched 
<A NAME="556"></A>fell,
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>The ram, launched free, goes drifting down the tide.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>Else, having shorn, they smear their bodies o'er
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>With acrid oil-lees, and mix silver-scum
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>And native sulphur and Idaean pitch,
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Wax mollified with ointment, and therewith
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Sea-leek, strong hellebores, bitumen black.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>Yet ne'er doth kindlier fortune crown his toil,
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Than if with blade of iron a man dare lance
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>The ulcer's mouth ope: for the taint is fed
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>And quickened by confinement; while the swain
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>His hand of healing from the wound withholds,
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>Or sits for happier signs imploring heaven.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Aye, and when inward to the bleater's bones
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>The pain hath sunk and rages, and their limbs
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>By thirsty fever are consumed, 'tis good
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>To draw the enkindled heat therefrom, and pierce
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Within the hoof-clefts a blood-bounding vein.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Of tribes Bisaltic such the wonted use,
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>And keen Gelonian, when to Rhodope
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>He flies, or Getic desert, and quaffs milk
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>With horse-blood curdled.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR><B>Seest one far afield</B>
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Oft to the shade's mild covert win, or pull
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>The grass tops listlessly, or hindmost lag,
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Or, browsing, cast her down amid the plain,
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>At night retire belated and alone;
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>With quick knife check the mischief, ere it creep
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>With dire contagion through the unwary herd.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Less thick and fast the whirlwind scours the main
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>With tempest in its wake, than swarm the plagues
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Of cattle; nor seize they single lives alone,
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>But sudden clear whole feeding grounds, the flock
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>With all its promise, and extirpate the breed.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>Well would he trow it who, so long after, still
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>High Alps and Noric hill-forts should behold,
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>And Iapydian Timavus' fields,
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Ay, still behold the shepherds' realms a waste,
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>And far and wide the lawns untenanted.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Here from distempered heavens erewhile arose
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>A piteous season, with the full fierce heat
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Of autumn glowed, and cattle-kindreds all
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>And all wild creatures to destruction gave,
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>Tainted the pools, the fodder charged with bane.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Nor simple was the way of death, but when
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>Hot thirst through every vein impelled had drawn
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Their wretched limbs together, anon o'erflowed
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>A watery flux, and all their bones piecemeal
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Sapped by corruption to itself absorbed.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Oft in mid sacrifice to heaven- the white
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Wool-woven fillet half wreathed about his brow-
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>Some victim, standing by the altar, there
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>Betwixt the loitering carles a-dying fell:
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Or, if betimes the slaughtering priest had struck,
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Nor with its heaped entrails blazed the pile,
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Nor seer to seeker thence could answer yield;
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Nay, scarce the up-stabbing knife with blood was 
<A NAME="613"></A>stained,
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>Scarce sullied with thin gore the surface-sand.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>Hence die the calves in many a pasture fair,
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>Or at full cribs their lives' sweet breath resign;
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Hence on the fawning dog comes madness, hence
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Racks the sick swine a gasping cough that chokes
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>With swelling at the jaws: the conquering steed,
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Uncrowned of effort and heedless of the sward,
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Faints, turns him from the springs, and paws the 
<A NAME="622"></A>earth
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>With ceaseless hoof: low droop his ears, wherefrom
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>Bursts fitful sweat, a sweat that waxes cold
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>Upon the dying beast; the skin is dry,
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>And rigidly repels the handler's touch.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>These earlier signs they give that presage doom.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>But, if the advancing plague 'gin fiercer grow,
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Then are their eyes all fire, deep-drawn their breath,
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>At times groan-laboured: with long sobbing heave
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Their lowest flanks; from either nostril streams
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>Black blood; a rough tongue clogs the obstructed 
<A NAME="633"></A>jaws.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>'Twas helpful through inverted horn to pour
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>Draughts of the wine-god down; sole way it seemed
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>To save the dying: soon this too proved their bane,
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>And, reinvigorate but with frenzy's fire,
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Even at death's pinch- the gods some happier fate
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Deal to the just, such madness to their foes-
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Each with bared teeth his own limbs mangling tore.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>See! as he smokes beneath the stubborn share,
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>The bull drops, vomiting foam-dabbled gore,
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>And heaves his latest groans. Sad goes the swain,
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Unhooks the steer that mourns his fellow's fate,
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>And in mid labour leaves the plough-gear fast.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>Nor tall wood's shadow, nor soft sward may stir
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>That heart's emotion, nor rock-channelled flood,
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>More pure than amber speeding to the plain:
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>But see! his flanks fail under him, his eyes
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Are dulled with deadly torpor, and his neck
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>Sinks to the earth with drooping weight. What now
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Besteads him toil or service? to have turned
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>The heavy sod with ploughshare? And yet these
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>Ne'er knew the Massic wine-god's baneful boon,
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>Nor twice replenished banquets: but on leaves
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>They fare, and virgin grasses, and their cups
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>Are crystal springs and streams with running tired,
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Their healthful slumbers never broke by care.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Then only, say they, through that country side
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>For Juno's rites were cattle far to seek,
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>And ill-matched buffaloes the chariots drew
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>To their high fanes. So, painfully with rakes
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>They grub the soil, aye, with their very nails
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>Dig in the corn-seeds, and with strained neck
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>O'er the high uplands drag the creaking wains.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>No wolf for ambush pries about the pen,
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>Nor round the flock prowls nightly; pain more sharp
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>Subdues him: the shy deer and fleet-foot stags
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>With hounds now wander by the haunts of men
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Vast ocean's offspring, and all tribes that swim,
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>On the shore's confine the wave washes up,
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Like shipwrecked bodies: seals, unwonted there,
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Flee to the rivers. Now the viper dies,
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>For all his den's close winding, and with scales
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Erect the astonied water-worms. The air
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>Brooks not the very birds, that headlong fall,
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>And leave their life beneath the soaring cloud.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>Moreover now nor change of fodder serves,
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>And subtlest cures but injure; then were foiled
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>The masters, Chiron sprung from Phillyron,
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>And Amythaon's son Melampus. See!
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>From Stygian darkness launched into the light
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>Comes raging pale Tisiphone; she drives
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Disease and fear before her, day by day
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>Still rearing higher that all-devouring head.
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>With bleat of flocks and lowings thick resound
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>Rivers and parched banks and sloping heights.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>At last in crowds she slaughters them, she chokes
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>The very stalls with carrion-heaps that rot
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>In hideous corruption, till men learn
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>With earth to cover them, in pits to hide.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>For e'en the fells are useless; nor the flesh
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>With water may they purge, or tame with fire,
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Nor shear the fleeces even, gnawed through and through
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>With foul disease, nor touch the putrid webs;
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>But, had one dared the loathly weeds to try,
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Red blisters and an unclean sweat o'erran
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>His noisome limbs, till, no long tarriance made,
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>The fiery curse his tainted frame devoured.
