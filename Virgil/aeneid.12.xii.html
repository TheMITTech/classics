<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field,
<A NAME="11"></A><BR>Their armies broken, and their courage quell'd,
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>Himself become the mark of public spite,
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>His honor question'd for the promis'd fight;
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>The more he was with vulgar hate oppress'd,
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>The more his fury boil'd within his breast:
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>He rous'd his vigor for the last debate,
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>And rais'd his haughty soul to meet his fate.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase,
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace;
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>But, if the pointed jav'lin pierce his side,
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>The lordly beast returns with double pride:
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain;
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>His sides he lashes, and erects his mane:
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire,
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>Thro' his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>Trembling with rage, around the court he ran,
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>At length approach'd the king, and thus began:
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>"No more excuses or delays: I stand
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>In arms prepar'd to combat, hand to hand,
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>This base deserter of his native land.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>The Trojan, by his word, is bound to take
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>The same conditions which himself did make.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Renew the truce; the solemn rites prepare,
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>And to my single virtue trust the war.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>The Latians unconcern'd shall see the fight;
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>This arm unaided shall assert your right:
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Then, if my prostrate body press the plain,
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>To him the crown and beauteous bride remain."
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>To whom the king sedately thus replied:
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>"Brave youth, the more your valor has been tried,
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>The more becomes it us, with due respect,
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>To weigh the chance of war, which you neglect.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>You want not wealth, or a successive throne,
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Or cities which your arms have made your own:
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>My towns and treasures are at your command,
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>And stor'd with blooming beauties is my land;
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>Laurentum more than one Lavinia sees,
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Unmarried, fair, of noble families.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>Now let me speak, and you with patience hear,
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Things which perhaps may grate a lover's ear,
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>But sound advice, proceeding from a heart
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>Sincerely yours, and free from fraudful art.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>The gods, by signs, have manifestly shown,
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>No prince Italian born should heir my throne:
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Oft have our augurs, in prediction skill'd,
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>And oft our priests, foreign son reveal'd.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>Yet, won by worth that cannot be withstood,
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Brib'd by my kindness to my kindred blood,
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>Urg'd by my wife, who would not be denied,
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>I promis'd my Lavinia for your bride:
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>Her from her plighted lord by force I took;
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>All ties of treaties, and of honor, broke:
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>On your account I wag'd an impious war-
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>With what success, 't is needless to declare;
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>I and my subjects feel, and you have had your share.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Twice vanquish'd while in bloody fields we strive,
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive:
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>The rolling flood runs warm with human gore;
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>The bones of Latians blanch the neighb'ring shore.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>Why put I not an end to this debate,
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Still unresolv'd, and still a slave to fate?
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>If Turnus' death a lasting peace can give,
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Why should I not procure it whilst you live?
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Should I to doubtful arms your youth betray,
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>What would my kinsmen the Rutulians say?
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>And, should you fall in fight, (which Heav'n defend!)
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>How curse the cause which hasten'd to his end
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>The daughter's lover and the father's friend?
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>Weigh in your mind the various chance of war;
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Pity your parent's age, and ease his care."
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>Such balmy words he pour'd, but all in vain:
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>The proffer'd med'cine but provok'd the pain.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>The wrathful youth, disdaining the relief,
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>With intermitting sobs thus vents his grief:
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>"The care, O best of fathers, which you take
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>For my concerns, at my desire forsake.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Permit me not to languish out my days,
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>But make the best exchange of life for praise.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>This arm, this lance, can well dispute the prize;
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>And the blood follows, where the weapon flies.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>His goddess mother is not near, to shroud
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>The flying coward with an empty cloud."
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>But now the queen, who fear'd for Turnus' life,
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>And loath'd the hard conditions of the strife,
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Held him by force; and, dying in his death,
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>In these sad accents gave her sorrow breath:
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>"O Turnus, I adjure thee by these tears,
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>And whate'er price Amata's honor bears
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>Within thy breast, since thou art all my hope,
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>My sickly mind's repose, my sinking age's prop;
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Since on the safety of thy life alone
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Depends Latinus, and the Latian throne:
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Refuse me not this one, this only pray'r,
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>To waive the combat, and pursue the war.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>Whatever chance attends this fatal strife,
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>Think it includes, in thine, Amata's life.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>I cannot live a slave, or see my throne
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>Usurp'd by strangers or a Trojan son."
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>At this, a flood of tears Lavinia shed;
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>A crimson blush her beauteous face o'erspread,
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Varying her cheeks by turns with white and red.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>The driving colors, never at a stay,
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Run here and there, and flush, and fade away.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>Delightful change! Thus Indian iv'ry shows,
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>Which with the bord'ring paint of purple glows;
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Or lilies damask'd by the neighb'ring rose.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>The lover gaz'd, and, burning with desire,
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>The more he look'd, the more he fed the fire:
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Revenge, and jealous rage, and secret spite,
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Roll in his breast, and rouse him to the fight.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Then fixing on the queen his ardent eyes,
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Firm to his first intent, he thus replies:
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>"O mother, do not by your tears prepare
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Such boding omens, and prejudge the war.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>Resolv'd on fight, I am no longer free
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>To shun my death, if Heav'n my death decree."
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Then turning to the herald, thus pursues:
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>"Go, greet the Trojan with ungrateful news;
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Denounce from me, that, when to-morrow's light
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>Shall gild the heav'ns, he need not urge the fight;
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>The Trojan and Rutulian troops no more
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Shall dye, with mutual blood, the Latian shore:
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>Our single swords the quarrel shall decide,
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>And to the victor be the beauteous bride."
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>He said, and striding on, with speedy pace,
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>He sought his coursers of the Thracian race.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>At his approach they toss their heads on high,
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>And, proudly neighing, promise victory.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>The sires of these Orythia sent from far,
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>To grace Pilumnus, when he went to war.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>The drifts of Thracian snows were scarce so white,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Nor northern winds in fleetness match'd their flight.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Officious grooms stand ready by his side;
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>And some with combs their flowing manes divide,
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>And others stroke their chests and gently soothe their 
<A NAME="146"></A>pride
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>He sheath'd his limbs in arms; a temper'd mass
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Of golden metal those, and mountain brass.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Then to his head his glitt'ring helm he tied,
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>And girt his faithful fauchion to his side.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>In his Aetnaean forge, the God of Fire
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>That fauchion labor'd for the hero's sire;
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Immortal keenness on the blade bestow'd,
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>And plung'd it hissing in the Stygian flood.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Propp'd on a pillar, which the ceiling bore,
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Was plac'd the lance Auruncan Actor wore;
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>Which with such force he brandish'd in his hand,
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>The tough ash trembled like an osier wand:
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Then cried: "O pond'rous spoil of Actor slain,
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>And never yet by Turnus toss'd in vain,
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Fail not this day thy wonted force; but go,
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Sent by this hand, to pierce the Trojan foe!
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Give me to tear his corslet from his breast,
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>And from that eunuch head to rend the crest;
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Dragg'd in the dust, his frizzled hair to soil,
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Hot from the vexing ir'n, and smear'd with fragrant 
<A NAME="167"></A>oil!"
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>Thus while he raves, from his wide nostrils flies
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>A fiery steam, and sparkles from his eyes.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>So fares the bull in his lov'd female's sight:
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Proudly he bellows, and preludes the fight;
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>He tries his goring horns against a tree,
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>And meditates his absent enemy;
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>He pushes at the winds; he digs the strand
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>With his black hoofs, and spurns the yellow sand.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Nor less the Trojan, in his Lemnian arms,
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>To future fight his manly courage warms:
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>He whets his fury, and with joy prepares
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>To terminate at once the ling'ring wars;
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>To cheer his chiefs and tender son, relates
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>What Heav'n had promis'd, and expounds the fates.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Then to the Latian king he sends, to cease
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>The rage of arms, and ratify the peace.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>The morn ensuing, from the mountain's height,
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Had scarcely spread the skies with rosy light;
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>Th' ethereal coursers, bounding from the sea,
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>From out their flaming nostrils breath'd the day;
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>When now the Trojan and Rutulian guard,
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>In friendly labor join'd, the list prepar'd.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Beneath the walls they measure out the space;
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Then sacred altars rear, on sods of grass,
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Where, with religious their common gods they place.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>In purest white the priests their heads attire;
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>And living waters bear, and holy fire;
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>And, o'er their linen hoods and shaded hair,
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Long twisted wreaths of sacred veryain wear,
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>In order issuing from the town appears
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>The Latin legion, arm'd with pointed spears;
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>And from the fields, advancing on a line,
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>The Trojan and the Tuscan forces join:
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>Their various arms afford a pleasing sight;
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>A peaceful train they seem, in peace prepar'd for 
<A NAME="203"></A>fight.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Betwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride,
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Glitt'ring with gold, and vests in purple dyed;
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Here Mnestheus, author of the Memmian line,
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>And there Messapus, born of seed divine.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>The sign is giv'n; and, round the listed space,
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>Each man in order fills his proper place.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Reclining on their ample shields, they stand,
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>And fix their pointed lances in the sand.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>Now, studious of the sight, a num'rous throng
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Of either sex promiscuous, old and young,
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Swarm the town: by those who rest behind,
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>The gates and walls and houses' tops are lin'd.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Meantime the Queen of Heav'n beheld the sight,
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>With eyes unpleas'd, from Mount Albano's height
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>(Since call'd Albano by succeeding fame,
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>But then an empty hill, without a name).
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>She thence survey'd the field, the Trojan pow'rs,
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>The Latian squadrons, and Laurentine tow'rs.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Then thus the goddess of the skies bespoke,
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>With sighs and tears, the goddess of the lake,
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>King Turnus' sister, once a lovely maid,
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>Ere to the lust of lawless Jove betray'd:
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Compress'd by force, but, by the grateful god,
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Now made the Nais of the neighb'ring flood.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>"O nymph, the pride of living lakes," said she,
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>"O most renown'd, and most belov'd by me,
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>Long hast thou known, nor need I to record,
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>The wanton sallies of my wand'ring lord.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>Of ev'ry Latian fair whom Jove misled
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>To mount by stealth my violated bed,
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>To thee alone I grudg'd not his embrace,
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>But gave a part of heav'n, and an unenvied place.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Now learn from me thy near approaching grief,
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Nor think my wishes want to thy relief.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>While fortune favor'd, nor Heav'n's King denied
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>To lend my succor to the Latian side,
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>I sav'd thy brother, and the sinking state:
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>But now he struggles with unequal fate,
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>And goes, with gods averse, o'ermatch'd in might,
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>To meet inevitable death in fight;
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Nor must I break the truce, nor can sustain the 
<A NAME="245"></A>sight.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Thou, if thou dar'st thy present aid supply;
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>It well becomes a sister's care to try."
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>At this the lovely nymph, with grief oppress'd,
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Thrice tore her hair, and beat her comely breast.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>To whom Saturnia thus: "Thy tears are late:
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>Haste, snatch him, if he can be snatch'd from fate:
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>New tumults kindle; violate the truce:
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Who knows what changeful fortune may produce?
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>'T is not a crime t' attempt what I decree;
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Or, if it were, discharge the crime on me."
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>She said, and, sailing on the winged wind,
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Left the sad nymph suspended in her mind.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>And now pomp the peaceful kings appear:
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Four steeds the chariot of Latinus bear;
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>Twelve golden beams around his temples play,
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>To mark his lineage from the God of Day.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Two snowy coursers Turnus' chariot yoke,
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>And in his hand two massy spears he shook:
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Then issued from the camp, in arms divine,
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>Aeneas, author of the Roman line;
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>And by his side Ascanius took his place,
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>The second hope of Rome's immortal race.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>Adorn'd in white, a rev'rend priest appears,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>And off'rings to the flaming altars bears;
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>A porket, and a lamb that never suffer'd shears.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Then to the rising sun he turns his eyes,
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>And strews the beasts, design'd for sacrifice,
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>With salt and meal: with like officious care
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>He marks their foreheads, and he clips their hair.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Betwixt their horns the purple wine he sheds;
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>With the same gen'rous juice the flame he feeds.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Aeneas then unsheath'd his shining sword,
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>And thus with pious pray'rs the gods ador'd:
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>"All-seeing sun, and thou, Ausonian soil,
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>For which I have sustain'd so long a toil,
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Thou, King of Heav'n, and thou, the Queen of Air,
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>Propitious now, and reconcil'd by pray'r;
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Thou, God of War, whose unresisted sway
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>The labors and events of arms obey;
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Ye living fountains, and ye running floods,
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>All pow'rs of ocean, all ethereal gods,
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Hear, and bear record: if I fall in field,
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Or, recreant in the fight, to Turnus yield,
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>My Trojans shall encrease Evander's town;
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Ascanius shall renounce th' Ausonian crown:
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>All claims, all questions of debate, shall cease;
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Nor he, nor they, with force infringe the peace.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>But, if my juster arms prevail in fight,
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>(As sure they shall, if I divine aright,)
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>My Trojans shall not o'er th' Italians reign:
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Both equal, both unconquer'd shall remain,
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>Join'd in their laws, their lands, and their abodes;
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>I ask but altars for my weary gods.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>The care of those religious rites be mine;
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>The crown to King Latinus I resign:
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>His be the sov'reign sway. Nor will I share
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>His pow'r in peace, or his command in war.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>For me, my friends another town shall frame,
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>And bless the rising tow'rs with fair Lavinia's 
<A NAME="305"></A>name."
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>Thus he. Then, with erected eyes and hands,
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>The Latian king before his altar stands.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>"By the same heav'n," said he, "and earth, and main,
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>And all the pow'rs that all the three contain;
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>By hell below, and by that upper god
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Whose thunder signs the peace, who seals it with his 
<A NAME="312"></A>nod;
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>So let Latona's double offspring hear,
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>And double-fronted Janus, what I swear:
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>I touch the sacred altars, touch the flames,
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>And all those pow'rs attest, and all their names;
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Whatever chance befall on either side,
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>No term of time this union shall divide:
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>No force, no fortune, shall my vows unbind,
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Or shake the steadfast tenor of my mind;
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Not tho' the circling seas should break their bound,
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>O'erflow the shores, or sap the solid ground;
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Not tho' the lamps of heav'n their spheres forsake,
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>Hurl'd down, and hissing in the nether lake:
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Ev'n as this royal scepter" (for he bore
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>A scepter in his hand) "shall never more
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>Shoot out in branches, or renew the birth:
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>An orphan now, cut from the mother earth
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>By the keen ax, dishonor'd of its hair,
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>And cas'd in brass, for Latian kings to bear."
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>When thus in public view the peace was tied
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>With solemn vows, and sworn on either side,
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>All dues perform'd which holy rites require;
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>The victim beasts are slain before the fire,
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>The trembling entrails from their bodies torn,
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>And to the fatten'd flames in chargers borne.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Already the Rutulians deem their man
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>O'ermatch'd in arms, before the fight began.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>First rising fears are whisper'd thro' the crowd;
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Then, gath'ring sound, they murmur more aloud.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Now, side to side, they measure with their eyes
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>The champions' bulk, their sinews, and their size:
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>The nearer they approach, the more is known
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Th' apparent disadvantage of their own.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>Turnus himself appears in public sight
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>Conscious of fate, desponding of the fight.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>Slowly he moves, and at his altar stands
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>With eyes dejected, and with trembling hands;
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>And, while he mutters undistinguish'd pray'rs,
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>A livid deadness in his cheeks appears.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>With anxious pleasure when Juturna view'd
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>Th' increasing fright of the mad multitude,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>When their short sighs and thick'ning sobs she heard,
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>And found their ready minds for change prepar'd;
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Dissembling her immortal form, she took
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Camertus' mien, his habit, and his look;
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>A chief of ancient blood; in arms well known
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Was his great sire, and he his greater son.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>His shape assum'd, amid the ranks she ran,
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>And humoring their first motions, thus began:
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>"For shame, Rutulians, can you bear the sight
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Of one expos'd for all, in single fight?
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>Can we, before the face of heav'n, confess
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Our courage colder, or our numbers less?
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>View all the Trojan host, th' Arcadian band,
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>And Tuscan army; count 'em as they stand:
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>Undaunted to the battle if we go,
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Scarce ev'ry second man will share a foe.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>Turnus, 't is true, in this unequal strife,
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Shall lose, with honor, his devoted life,
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Or change it rather for immortal fame,
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>Succeeding to the gods, from whence he came:
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>But you, a servile and inglorious band,
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>For foreign lords shall sow your native land,
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>Those fruitful fields your fighting fathers gain'd,
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Which have so long their lazy sons sustain'd."
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>With words like these, she carried her design:
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>A rising murmur runs along the line.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>Then ev'n the city troops, and Latians, tir'd
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>With tedious war, seem with new souls inspir'd:
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Their champion's fate with pity they lament,
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>And of the league, so lately sworn, repent.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Nor fails the goddess to foment the rage
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>With lying wonders, and a false presage;
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>But adds a sign, which, present to their eyes,
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Inspires new courage, and a glad surprise.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>For, sudden, in the fiery tracts above,
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Appears in pomp th' imperial bird of Jove:
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>A plump of fowl he spies, that swim the lakes,
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>And o'er their heads his sounding pinions shakes;
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>Then, stooping on the fairest of the train,
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>In his strong talons truss'd a silver swan.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Th' Italians wonder at th' unusual sight;
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>But, while he lags, and labors in his flight,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Behold, the dastard fowl return anew,
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>And with united force the foe pursue:
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>Clam'rous around the royal hawk they fly,
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>And, thick'ning in a cloud, o'ershade the sky.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>They cuff, they scratch, they cross his airy course;
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Nor can th' incumber'd bird sustain their force;
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>But vex'd, not vanquish'd, drops the pond'rous prey,
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>And, lighten'd of his burthen, wings his way.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Th' Ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight,
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>Eager of action, and demand the fight.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>Then King Tolumnius, vers'd in augurs' arts,
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Cries out, and thus his boasted skill imparts:
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>"At length 't is granted, what I long desir'd!
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>This, this is what my frequent vows requir'd.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>Ye gods, I take your omen, and obey.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Advance, my friends, and charge! I lead the way.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>These are the foreign foes, whose impious band,
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Like that rapacious bird, infest our land:
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>But soon, like him, they shall be forc'd to sea
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>By strength united, and forego the prey.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Your timely succor to your country bring,
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>Haste to the rescue, and redeem your king."
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>He said; and, pressing onward thro' the crew,
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>Pois'd in his lifted arm, his lance he threw.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>The winged weapon, whistling in the wind,
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>Came driving on, nor miss'd the mark design'd.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>At once the cornel rattled in the skies;
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>At once tumultuous shouts and clamors rise.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Nine brothers in a goodly band there stood,
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Born of Arcadian mix'd with Tuscan blood,
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Gylippus' sons: the fatal jav'lin flew,
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Aim'd at the midmost of the friendly crew.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>A passage thro' the jointed arms it found,
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>Just where the belt was to the body bound,
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>And struck the gentle youth extended on the ground.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Then, fir'd with pious rage, the gen'rous train
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Run madly forward to revenge the slain.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>And some with eager haste their jav'lins throw;
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>And some with sword in hand assault the foe.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>The wish'd insult the Latine troops embrace,
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>And meet their ardor in the middle space.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>The Trojans, Tuscans, and Arcadian line,
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>With equal courage obviate their design.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Peace leaves the violated fields, and hate
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>Both armies urges to their mutual fate.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>With impious haste their altars are o'erturn'd,
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>The sacrifice half-broil'd, and half-unburn'd.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>Thick storms of steel from either army fly,
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>And clouds of clashing darts obscure the sky;
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Brands from the fire are missive weapons made,
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>With chargers, bowls, and all the priestly trade.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Latinus, frighted, hastens from the fray,
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>And bears his unregarded gods away.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>These on their horses vault; those yoke the car;
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>The rest, with swords on high, run headlong to the 
<A NAME="450"></A>war.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Messapus, eager to confound the peace,
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Spurr'd his hot courser thro' the fighting prease,
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>At King Aulestes, by his purple known
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>A Tuscan prince, and by his regal crown;
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>And, with a shock encount'ring, bore him down.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Backward he fell; and, as his fate design'd,
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>The ruins of an altar were behind:
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>There, pitching on his shoulders and his head,
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Amid the scatt'ring fires he lay supinely spread.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>The beamy spear, descending from above,
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>His cuirass pierc'd, and thro' his body drove.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Then, with a scornful smile, the victor cries:
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>"The gods have found a fitter sacrifice."
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Greedy of spoils, th' Italians strip the dead
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Of his rich armor, and uncrown his head.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>Priest Corynaeus, arm'd his better hand,
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>From his own altar, with a blazing brand;
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>And, as Ebusus with a thund'ring pace
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Advanc'd to battle, dash'd it on his face:
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>His bristly beard shines out with sudden fires;
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>The crackling crop a noisome scent expires.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>Following the blow, he seiz'd his curling crown
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>With his left hand; his other cast him down.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>The prostrate body with his knees he press'd,
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>And plung'd his holy poniard in his breast.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>While Podalirius, with his sword, pursued
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>The shepherd Alsus thro' the flying crowd,
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>Swiftly he turns, and aims a deadly blow
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Full on the front of his unwary foe.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>The broad ax enters with a crashing sound,
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>And cleaves the chin with one continued wound;
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>Warm blood, and mingled brains, besmear his arms 
<A NAME="483"></A>around
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>An iron sleep his stupid eyes oppress'd,
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>And seal'd their heavy lids in endless rest.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>But good Aeneas rush'd amid the bands;
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Bare was his head, and naked were his hands,
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>In sign of truce: then thus he cries aloud:
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>"What sudden rage, what new desire of blood,
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Inflames your alter'd minds? O Trojans, cease
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>From impious arms, nor violate the peace!
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>By human sanctions, and by laws divine,
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>The terms are all agreed; the war is mine.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Dismiss your fears, and let the fight ensue;
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>This hand alone shall right the gods and you:
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Our injur'd altars, and their broken vow,
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>To this avenging sword the faithless Turnus owe."
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Thus while he spoke, unmindful of defense,
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>A winged arrow struck the pious prince.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>But, whether from some human hand it came,
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Or hostile god, is left unknown by fame:
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>No human hand or hostile god was found,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>To boast the triumph of so base a wound.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>When Turnus saw the Trojan quit the plain,
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>His chiefs dismay'd, his troops a fainting train,
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Th' unhop'd event his heighten'd soul inspires:
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>At once his arms and coursers he requires;
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>Then, with a leap, his lofty chariot gains,
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>And with a ready hand assumes the reins.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>He drives impetuous, and, where'er he goes,
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>He leaves behind a lane of slaughter'd foes.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>These his lance reaches; over those he rolls
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>His rapid car, and crushes out their souls:
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>In vain the vanquish'd fly; the victor sends
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>The dead men's weapons at their living friends.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Thus, on the banks of Hebrus' freezing flood,
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>The God of Battles, in his angry mood,
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Clashing his sword against his brazen shield,
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Let loose the reins, and scours along the field:
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Before the wind his fiery coursers fly;
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Groans the sad earth, resounds the rattling sky.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>Wrath, Terror, Treason, Tumult, and Despair
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>(Dire faces, and deform'd) surround the car;
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Friends of the god, and followers of the war.
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>With fury not unlike, nor less disdain,
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Exulting Turnus flies along the plain:
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>His smoking horses, at their utmost speed,
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>He lashes on, and urges o'er the dead.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>Their fetlocks run with blood; and, when they bound,
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>The gore and gath'ring dust are dash'd around.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>Thamyris and Pholus, masters of the war,
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>He kill'd at hand, but Sthenelus afar:
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>From far the sons of Imbracus he slew,
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>Glaucus and Lades, of the Lycian crew;
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>Both taught to fight on foot, in battle join'd,
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>Or mount the courser that outstrips the wind.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>Meantime Eumedes, vaunting in the field,
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>New fir'd the Trojans, and their foes repell'd.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>This son of Dolon bore his grandsire's name,
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>But emulated more his father's fame;
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>His guileful father, sent a nightly spy,
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>The Grecian camp and order to descry:
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Hard enterprise! and well he might require
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Achilles' car and horses, for his hire:
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>But, met upon the scout, th' Aetolian prince
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>In death bestow'd a juster recompense.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>Fierce Turnus view'd the Trojan from afar,
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>And launch'd his jav'lin from his lofty car;
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Then lightly leaping down, pursued the blow,
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>And, pressing with his foot his prostrate foe,
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Wrench'd from his feeble hold the shining sword,
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>And plung'd it in the bosom of its lord.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>"Possess," said he, "the fruit of all thy pains,
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>And measure, at thy length, our Latian plains.
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Thus are my foes rewarded by my hand;
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Thus may they build their town, and thus enjoy the 
<A NAME="557"></A>land!"
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>Then Dares, Butes, Sybaris he slew,
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>Whom o'er his neck his flound'ring courser threw.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>As when loud Boreas, with his blust'ring train,
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Stoops from above, incumbent on the main;
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Where'er he flies, he drives the rack before,
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>And rolls the billows on th' Aegaean shore:
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>So, where resistless Turnus takes his course,
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>The scatter'd squadrons bend before his force;
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>His crest of horses' hair is blown behind
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>By adverse air, and rustles in the wind.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>This haughty Phegeus saw with high disdain,
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>And, as the chariot roll'd along the plain,
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Light from the ground he leapt, and seiz'd the rein.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Thus hung in air, he still retain'd his hold,
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>The coursers frighted, and their course controll'd.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>The lance of Turnus reach'd him as he hung,
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>And pierc'd his plated arms, but pass'd along,
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>And only raz'd the skin. He turn'd, and held
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Against his threat'ning foe his ample shield;
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Then call'd for aid: but, while he cried in vain,
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>The chariot bore him backward on the plain.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>He lies revers'd; the victor king descends,
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>And strikes so justly where his helmet ends,
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>He lops the head. The Latian fields are drunk
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>With streams that issue from the bleeding trunk.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>While he triumphs, and while the Trojans yield,
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>The wounded prince is forc'd to leave the field:
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Strong Mnestheus, and Achates often tried,
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>And young Ascanius, weeping by his side,
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Conduct him to his tent. Scarce can he rear
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>His limbs from earth, supported on his spear.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>Resolv'd in mind, regardless of the smart,
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>He tugs with both his hands, and breaks the dart.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>The steel remains. No readier way he found
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>To draw the weapon, than t' inlarge the wound.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Eager of fight, impatient of delay,
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>He begs; and his unwilling friends obey.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Iapis was at hand to prove his art,
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Whose blooming youth so fir'd Apollo's heart,
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>That, for his love, he proffer'd to bestow
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>His tuneful harp and his unerring bow.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>The pious youth, more studious how to save
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>His aged sire, now sinking to the grave,
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>Preferr'd the pow'r of plants, and silent praise
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Of healing arts, before Phoebean bays.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>Propp'd on his lance the pensive hero stood,
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>And heard and saw, unmov'd, the mourning crowd.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>The fam'd physician tucks his robes around
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>With ready hands, and hastens to the wound.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>With gentle touches he performs his part,
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>This way and that, soliciting the dart,
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>And exercises all his heav'nly art.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>All soft'ning simples, known of sov'reign use,
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>He presses out, and pours their noble juice.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>These first infus'd, to lenify the pain,
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>He tugs with pincers, but he tugs in vain.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>Then to the patron of his art he pray'd:
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>The patron of his art refus'd his aid.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>Meantime the war approaches to the tents;
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Th' alarm grows hotter, and the noise augments:
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>The driving dust proclaims the danger near;
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>And first their friends, and then their foes appear:
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Their friends retreat; their foes pursue the rear.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>The camp is fill'd with terror and affright:
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>The hissing shafts within the trench alight;
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>An undistinguish'd noise ascends the sky,
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>The shouts those who kill, and groans of those who 
<A NAME="625"></A>die.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>But now the goddess mother, mov'd with grief,
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>And pierc'd with pity, hastens her relief.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>A branch of healing dittany she brought,
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Which in the Cretan fields with care she sought:
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>Rough is the stern, which woolly leafs surround;
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>The leafs with flow'rs, the flow'rs with purple 
<A NAME="632"></A>crown'd,
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Well known to wounded goats; a sure relief
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>To draw the pointed steel, and ease the grief.
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>This Venus brings, in clouds involv'd, and brews
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Th' extracted liquor with ambrosian dews,
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>And odorous panacee. Unseen she stands,
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Temp'ring the mixture with her heav'nly hands,
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>And pours it in a bowl, already crown'd
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>With juice of med'c'nal herbs prepar'd to bathe the 
<A NAME="641"></A>wound.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>The leech, unknowing of superior art
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Which aids the cure, with this foments the part;
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>And in a moment ceas'd the raging smart.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>Stanch'd is the blood, and in the bottom stands:
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>The steel, but scarcely touch'd with tender hands,
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Moves up, and follows of its own accord,
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>And health and vigor are at once restor'd.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>Iapis first perceiv'd the closing wound,
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>And first the footsteps of a god he found.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>"Arms! arms!" he cries; "the sword and shield prepare,
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>And send the willing chief, renew'd, to war.
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>This is no mortal work, no cure of mine,
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>Nor art's effect, but done by hands divine.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>Some god our general to the battle sends;
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Some god preserves his life for greater ends."
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>The hero arms in haste; his hands infold
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>His thighs with cuishes of refulgent gold:
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>Inflam'd to fight, and rushing to the field,
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>That hand sustaining the celestial shield,
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>This gripes the lance, and with such vigor shakes,
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>That to the rest the beamy weapon quakes.
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>Then with a close embrace he strain'd his son,
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>And, kissing thro' his helmet, thus begun:
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>"My son, from my example learn the war,
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>In camps to suffer, and in fields to dare;
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>But happier chance than mine attend thy care!
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>This day my hand thy tender age shall shield,
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>And crown with honors of the conquer'd field:
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Thou, when thy riper years shall send thee forth
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>To toils of war, be mindful of my worth;
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Assert thy birthright, and in arms be known,
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>For Hector's nephew, and Aeneas' son."
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>He said; and, striding, issued on the plain.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Anteus and Mnestheus, and a num'rous train,
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>Attend his steps; the rest their weapons take,
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>And, crowding to the field, the camp forsake.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>A cloud of blinding dust is rais'd around,
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Labors beneath their feet the trembling ground.
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Now Turnus, posted on a hill, from far
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Beheld the progress of the moving war:
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>With him the Latins view'd the cover'd plains,
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>And the chill blood ran backward in their veins.
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Juturna saw th' advancing troops appear,
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>And heard the hostile sound, and fled for fear.
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>Aeneas leads; and draws a sweeping train,
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>Clos'd in their ranks, and pouring on the plain.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>As when a whirlwind, rushing to the shore
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>From the mid ocean, drives the waves before;
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>The painful hind with heavy heart foresees
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>The flatted fields, and slaughter of the trees;
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>With like impetuous rage the prince appears
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>Before his doubled front, nor less destruction bears.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>And now both armies shock in open field;
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>Osiris is by strong Thymbraeus kill'd.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Archetius, Ufens, Epulon, are slain
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>(All fam'd in arms, and of the Latian train)
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>By Gyas', Mnestheus', and Achates' hand.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>The fatal augur falls, by whose command
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>The truce was broken, and whose lance, embrued
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>With Trojan blood, th' unhappy fight renew'd.
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>Loud shouts and clamors rend the liquid sky,
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>And o'er the field the frighted Latins fly.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>The prince disdains the dastards to pursue,
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few;
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>Turnus alone, amid the dusky plain,
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>He seeks, and to the combat calls in vain.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Juturna heard, and, seiz'd with mortal fear,
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>Forc'd from the beam her brother's charioteer;
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>Assumes his shape, his armor, and his mien,
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>And, like Metiscus, in his seat is seen.
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>As the black swallow near the palace plies;
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>O'er empty courts, and under arches, flies;
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Now hawks aloft, now skims along the flood,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>To furnish her loquacious nest with food:
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>So drives the rapid goddess o'er the plains;
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>The smoking horses run with loosen'd reins.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>She steers a various course among the foes;
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>Now here, now there, her conqu'ring brother shows;
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>Now with a straight, now with a wheeling flight,
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>She turns, and bends, but shuns the single fight.
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Aeneas, fir'd with fury, breaks the crowd,
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>And seeks his foe, and calls by name aloud:
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>He runs within a narrower ring, and tries
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>To stop the chariot; but the chariot flies.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>If he but gain a glimpse, Juturna fears,
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>And far away the Daunian hero bears.
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>What should he do! Nor arts nor arms avail;
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>And various cares in vain his mind assail.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>The great Messapus, thund'ring thro' the field,
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>In his left hand two pointed jav'lins held:
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Encount'ring on the prince, one dart he drew,
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>And with unerring aim and utmost vigor threw.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>Aeneas saw it come, and, stooping low
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Beneath his buckler, shunn'd the threat'ning blow.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>The weapon hiss'd above his head, and tore
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>The waving plume which on his helm he wore.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>Forced by this hostile act, and fir'd with spite,
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>That flying Turnus still declin'd the fight,
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>The Prince, whose piety had long repell'd
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>His inborn ardor, now invades the field;
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>Invokes the pow'rs of violated peace,
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>Their rites and injur'd altars to redress;
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>Then, to his rage abandoning the rein,
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>With blood and slaughter'd bodies fills the plain.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>What god can tell, what numbers can display,
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>The various labors of that fatal day;
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>What chiefs and champions fell on either side,
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>In combat slain, or by what deaths they died;
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>Whom Turnus, whom the Trojan hero kill'd;
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>Who shar'd the fame and fortune of the field!
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>Jove, could'st thou view, and not avert thy sight,
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Two jarring nations join'd in cruel fight,
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>Whom leagues of lasting love so shortly shall unite!
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>Aeneas first Rutulian Sucro found,
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>Whose valor made the Trojans quit their ground;
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>Betwixt his ribs the jav'lin drove so just,
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>It reach'd his heart, nor needs a second thrust.
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>Now Turnus, at two blows, two brethren slew;
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>First from his horse fierce Amycus he threw:
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Then, leaping on the ground, on foot assail'd
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>Diores, and in equal fight prevail'd.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>Their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place;
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>Their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>Three cold on earth the Trojan hero threw,
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>Whom without respite at one charge he slew:
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>Cethegus, Tanais, Tagus, fell oppress'd,
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>And sad Onythes, added to the rest,
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Of Theban blood, whom Peridia bore.
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>Turnus two brothers from the Lycian shore,
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>And from Apollo's fane to battle sent,
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>O'erthrew; nor Phoebus could their fate prevent.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>Peaceful Menoetes after these he kill'd,
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>Who long had shunn'd the dangers of the field:
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>On Lerna's lake a silent life he led,
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>And with his nets and angle earn'd his bread;
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Nor pompous cares, nor palaces, he knew,
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>But wisely from th' infectious world withdrew:
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>Poor was his house; his father's painful hand
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>Discharg'd his rent, and plow'd another's land.
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>As flames among the lofty woods are thrown
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>On diff'rent sides, and both by winds are blown;
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>The laurels crackle in the sputt'ring fire;
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>The frighted sylvans from their shades retire:
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>Or as two neighb'ring torrents fall from high;
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>Rapid they run; the foamy waters fry;
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>They roll to sea with unresisted force,
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>And down the rocks precipitate their course:
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Not with less rage the rival heroes take
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>Their diff'rent ways, nor less destruction make.
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>With spears afar, with swords at hand, they strike;
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>And zeal of slaughter fires their souls alike.
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>Like them, their dauntless men maintain the field;
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>And hearts are pierc'd, unknowing how to yield:
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>They blow for blow return, and wound for wound;
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>And heaps of bodies raise the level ground.
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>Murranus, boasting of his blood, that springs
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>From a long royal race of Latian kings,
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>Is by the Trojan from his chariot thrown,
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>Crush'd with the weight of an unwieldy stone:
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>Betwixt the wheels he fell; the wheels, that bore
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>His living load, his dying body tore.
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>His starting steeds, to shun the glitt'ring sword,
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>Paw down his trampled limbs, forgetful of their 
<A NAME="805"></A>lord.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>Fierce Hyllus threaten'd high, and, face to face,
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>Affronted Turnus in the middle space:
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>The prince encounter'd him in full career,
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>And at his temples aim'd the deadly spear;
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>So fatally the flying weapon sped,
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>That thro' his helm it pierc'd his head.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Nor, Cisseus, couldst thou scape from Turnus' hand,
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>In vain the strongest of th' Arcadian band:
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Nor to Cupentus could his gods afford
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>Availing aid against th' Aenean sword,
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>Which to his naked heart pursued the course;
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>Nor could his plated shield sustain the force.
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>Iolas fell, whom not the Grecian pow'rs,
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>Nor great subverter of the Trojan tow'rs,
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>Were doom'd to kill, while Heav'n prolong'd his 
<A NAME="821"></A>date;
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>But who can pass the bounds, prefix'd by fate?
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>In high Lyrnessus, and in Troy, he held
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Two palaces, and was from each expell'd:
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>Of all the mighty man, the last remains
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>A little spot of foreign earth contains.
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>And now both hosts their broken troops unite
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>In equal ranks, and mix in mortal fight.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>Seresthus and undaunted Mnestheus join
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>The Trojan, Tuscan, and Arcadian line:
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>Sea-born Messapus, with Atinas, heads
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>The Latin squadrons, and to battle leads.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>They strike, they push, they throng the scanty space,
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>Resolv'd on death, impatient of disgrace;
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>And, where one falls, another fills his place.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>The Cyprian goddess now inspires her son
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>To leave th' unfinish'd fight, and storm the town:
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>For, while he rolls his eyes around the plain
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>In quest of Turnus, whom he seeks in vain,
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>He views th' unguarded city from afar,
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>In careless quiet, and secure of war.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>Occasion offers, and excites his mind
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>To dare beyond the task he first design'd.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>Resolv'd, he calls his chiefs; they leave the fight:
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>Attended thus, he takes a neighb'ring height;
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>The crowding troops about their gen'ral stand,
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>All under arms, and wait his high command.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>Then thus the lofty prince: "Hear and obey,
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>Ye Trojan bands, without the least delay
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>Jove is with us; and what I have decreed
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>Requires our utmost vigor, and our speed.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>Your instant arms against the town prepare,
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>The source of mischief, and the seat of war.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>This day the Latian tow'rs, that mate the sky,
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>Shall level with the plain in ashes lie:
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>The people shall be slaves, unless in time
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>They kneel for pardon, and repent their crime.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>Twice have our foes been vanquish'd on the plain:
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>Then shall I wait till Turnus will be slain?
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>Your force against the perjur'd city bend.
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>There it began, and there the war shall end.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>The peace profan'd our rightful arms requires;
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>Cleanse the polluted place with purging fires."
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>He finish'd; and, one soul inspiring all,
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>Form'd in a wedge, the foot approach the wall.
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>Without the town, an unprovided train
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>Of gaping, gazing citizens are slain.
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>Some firebrands, others scaling ladders bear,
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>And those they toss aloft, and these they rear:
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>The flames now launch'd, the feather'd arrows fly,
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>And clouds of missive arms obscure the sky.
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>Advancing to the front, the hero stands,
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>And, stretching out to heav'n his pious hands,
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>Attests the gods, asserts his innocence,
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>Upbraids with breach of faith th' Ausonian prince;
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>Declares the royal honor doubly stain'd,
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>And twice the rites of holy peace profan'd.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>Dissenting clamors in the town arise;
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>Each will be heard, and all at once advise.
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>One part for peace, and one for war contends;
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>Some would exclude their foes, and some admit their 
<A NAME="882"></A>friends.
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>The helpless king is hurried in the throng,
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>And, whate'er tide prevails, is borne along.
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>Thus, when the swain, within a hollow rock,
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>Invades the bees with suffocating smoke,
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>They run around, or labor on their wings,
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>Disus'd to flight, and shoot their sleepy stings;
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>To shun the bitter fumes in vain they try;
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>Black vapors, issuing from the vent, involve the 
<A NAME="891"></A>sky.
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>But fate and envious fortune now prepare
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>To plunge the Latins in the last despair.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>The queen, who saw the foes invade the town,
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>And brands on tops of burning houses thrown,
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>Cast round her eyes, distracted with her fear-
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>No troops of Turnus in the field appear.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>Once more she stares abroad, but still in vain,
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>And then concludes the royal youth is slain.
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>Mad with her anguish, impotent to bear
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>The mighty grief, she loathes the vital air.
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>She calls herself the cause of all this ill,
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>And owns the dire effects of her ungovern'd will;
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>She raves against the gods; she beats her breast;
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>She tears with both her hands her purple vest:
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>Then round a beam a running noose she tied,
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>And, fasten'd by the neck, obscenely died.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>Soon as the fatal news by Fame was blown,
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>And to her dames and to her daughter known,
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>The sad Lavinia rends her yellow hair
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>And rosy cheeks; the rest her sorrow share:
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>With shrieks the palace rings, and madness of despair.
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>The spreading rumor fills the public place:
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>Confusion, fear, distraction, and disgrace,
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>And silent shame, are seen in ev'ry face.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>Latinus tears his garments as he goes,
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>Both for his public and his private woes;
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>With filth his venerable beard besmears,
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>And sordid dust deforms his silver hairs.
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>And much he blames the softness of his mind,
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>Obnoxious to the charms of womankind,
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>And soon seduc'd to change what he so well design'd;
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>To break the solemn league so long desir'd,
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>Nor finish what his fates, and those of Troy, requir'd.
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>Now Turnus rolls aloof o'er empty plains,
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>And here and there some straggling foes he gleans.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>His flying coursers please him less and less,
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>Asham'd of easy fight and cheap success.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>Thus half-contented, anxious in his mind,
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>The distant cries come driving in the wind,
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>Shouts from the walls, but shouts in murmurs drown'd;
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>A jarring mixture, and a boding sound.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>"Alas!" said he, "what mean these dismal cries?
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>What doleful clamors from the town arise?"
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>Confus'd, he stops, and backward pulls the reins.
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>She who the driver's office now sustains,
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>Replies: "Neglect, my lord, these new alarms;
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>Here fight, and urge the fortune of your arms:
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>There want not others to defend the wall.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>If by your rival's hand th' Italians fall,
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>So shall your fatal sword his friends oppress,
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>In honor equal, equal in success."
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>To this, the prince: "O sister- for I knew
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>The peace infring'd proceeded first from you;
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>I knew you, when you mingled first in fight;
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>And now in vain you would deceive my sight-
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>Why, goddess, this unprofitable care?
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>Who sent you down from heav'n, involv'd in air,
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>Your share of mortal sorrows to sustain,
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>And see your brother bleeding on the plain?
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>For to what pow'r can Turnus have recourse,
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>Or how resist his fate's prevailing force?
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>These eyes beheld Murranus bite the ground:
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>Mighty the man, and mighty was the wound.
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>I heard my dearest friend, with dying breath,
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>My name invoking to revenge his death.
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>Brave Ufens fell with honor on the place,
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>To shun the shameful sight of my disgrace.
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>On earth supine, a manly corpse he lies;
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>His vest and armor are the victor's prize.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>Then, shall I see Laurentum in a flame,
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>Which only wanted, to complete my shame?
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>How will the Latins hoot their champion's flight!
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>How Drances will insult and point them to the sight!
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>Is death so hard to bear? Ye gods below,
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>(Since those above so small compassion show,)
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>Receive a soul unsullied yet with shame,
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>Which not belies my great forefather's name!"
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>He said; and while he spoke, with flying speed
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>Came Sages urging on his foamy steed:
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>Fix'd on his wounded face a shaft he bore,
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>And, seeking Turnus, sent his voice before:
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>"Turnus, on you, on you alone, depends
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>Our last relief: compassionate your friends!
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>Like lightning, fierce Aeneas, rolling on,
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>With arms invests, with flames invades the town:
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>The brands are toss'd on high; the winds conspire
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>To drive along the deluge of the fire.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>All eyes are fix'd on you: your foes rejoice;
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>Ev'n the king staggers, and suspends his choice;
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>Doubts to deliver or defend the town,
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>Whom to reject, or whom to call his son.
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>The queen, on whom your utmost hopes were plac'd,
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>Herself suborning death, has breath'd her last.
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>'T is true, Messapus, fearless of his fate,
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>With fierce Atinas' aid, defends the gate:
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>On ev'ry side surrounded by the foe,
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>The more they kill, the greater numbers grow;
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>An iron harvest mounts, and still remains to mow.
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>You, far aloof from your forsaken bands,
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>Your rolling chariot drive o'er empty
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>Stupid he sate, his eyes on earth declin'd,
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>And various cares revolving in his mind:
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>Rage, boiling from the bottom of his breast,
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>And sorrow mix'd with shame, his soul oppress'd;
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>And conscious worth lay lab'ring in his thought,
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>And love by jealousy to madness wrought.
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>By slow degrees his reason drove away
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>The mists of passion, and resum'd her sway.
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>Then, rising on his car, he turn'd his look,
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>And saw the town involv'd in fire and smoke.
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>A wooden tow'r with flames already blaz'd,
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>Which his own hands on beams and rafters rais'd;
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>And bridges laid above to join the space,
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>And wheels below to roll from place to place.
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>"Sister, the Fates have vanquish'd: let us go
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>The way which Heav'n and my hard fortune show.
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>The fight is fix'd; nor shall the branded name
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>Of a base coward blot your brother's fame.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>Death is my choice; but suffer me to try
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>My force, and vent my rage before I die."
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>He said; and, leaping down without delay,
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>Thro' crowds of scatter'd foes he freed his way.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>Striding he pass'd, impetuous as the wind,
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>And left the grieving goddess far behind.
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>As when a fragment, from a mountain torn
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>By raging tempests, or by torrents borne,
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>Or sapp'd by time, or loosen'd from the roots-
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>Prone thro' the void the rocky ruin shoots,
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>Rolling from crag to crag, from steep to steep;
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>Down sink, at once, the shepherds and their sheep:
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>Involv'd alike, they rush to nether ground;
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>Stunn'd with the shock they fall, and stunn'd from earth 
<A NAME="1024"></A>rebound:
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>So Turnus, hasting headlong to the town,
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>Should'ring and shoving, bore the squadrons down.
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>Still pressing onward, to the walls he drew,
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>Where shafts, and spears, and darts promiscuous 
<A NAME="1029"></A>flew,
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>And sanguine streams the slipp'ry ground embrue.
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>First stretching out his arm, in sign of peace,
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>He cries aloud, to make the combat cease:
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>"Rutulians, hold; and Latin troops, retire!
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>The fight is mine; and me the gods require.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>'T is just that I should vindicate alone
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>The broken truce, or for the breach atone.
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>This day shall free from wars th' Ausonian state,
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>Or finish my misfortunes in my fate."
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>Both armies from their bloody work desist,
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>And, bearing backward, form a spacious list.
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>The Trojan hero, who receiv'd from fame
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>The welcome sound, and heard the champion's name,
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>Soon leaves the taken works and mounted walls,
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>Greedy of war where greater glory calls.
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>He springs to fight, exulting in his force
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>His jointed armor rattles in the course.
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>Like Eryx, or like Athos, great he shows,
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>Or Father Apennine, when, white with snows,
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>His head divine obscure in clouds he hides,
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>And shakes the sounding forest on his sides.
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>The nations, overaw'd, surcease the fight;
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>Immovable their bodies, fix'd their sight.
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>Ev'n death stands still; nor from above they throw
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>Their darts, nor drive their batt'ring-rams below.
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>In silent order either army stands,
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>And drop their swords, unknowing, from their hands.
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>Th' Ausonian king beholds, with wond'ring sight,
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>Two mighty champions match'd in single fight,
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>Born under climes remote, and brought by fate,
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>With swords to try their titles to the state.
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>Now, in clos'd field, each other from afar
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>They view; and, rushing on, begin the war.
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>They launch their spears; then hand to hand they 
<A NAME="1064"></A>meet;
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>The trembling soil resounds beneath their feet:
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>Their bucklers clash; thick blows descend from high,
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>And flakes of fire from their hard helmets fly.
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>Courage conspires with chance, and both ingage
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>With equal fortune yet, and mutual rage.
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>As when two bulls for their fair female fight
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>In Sila's shades, or on Taburnus' height;
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>With horns adverse they meet; the keeper flies;
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>Mute stands the herd; the heifers roll their eyes,
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>And wait th' event; which victor they shall bear,
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>And who shall be the lord, to rule the lusty year:
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>With rage of love the jealous rivals burn,
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>And push for push, and wound for wound return;
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>Their dewlaps gor'd, their sides are lav'd in blood;
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>Loud cries and roaring sounds rebellow thro' the 
<A NAME="1080"></A>wood:
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>Such was the combat in the listed ground;
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>So clash their swords, and so their shields resound.
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>Jove sets the beam; in either scale he lays
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>The champions' fate, and each exactly weighs.
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>On this side, life and lucky chance ascends;
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>Loaded with death, that other scale descends.
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>Rais'd on the stretch, young Turnus aims a blow
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>Full on the helm of his unguarded foe:
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>Shrill shouts and clamors ring on either side,
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>As hopes and fears their panting hearts divide.
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>But all in pieces flies the traitor sword,
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>And, in the middle stroke, deserts his lord.
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>Now is but death, or flight; disarm'd he flies,
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>When in his hand an unknown hilt he spies.
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>Fame says that Turnus, when his steeds he join'd,
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>Hurrying to war, disorder'd in his mind,
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>Snatch'd the first weapon which his haste could 
<A NAME="1098"></A>find.
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>'T was not the fated sword his father bore,
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>But that his charioteer Metiscus wore.
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>This, while the Trojans fled, the toughness held;
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>But, vain against the great Vulcanian shield,
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>The mortal-temper'd steel deceiv'd his hand:
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>The shiver'd fragments shone amid the sand.
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>Surpris'd with fear, he fled along the field,
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>And now forthright, and now in orbits wheel'd;
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>For here the Trojan troops the list surround,
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>And there the pass is clos'd with pools and marshy 
<A NAME="1109"></A>ground.
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>Aeneas hastens, tho' with heavier pace-
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>His wound, so newly knit, retards the chase,
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>And oft his trembling knees their aid refuse-
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>Yet, pressing foot by foot, his foe pursues.
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>Thus, when a fearful stag is clos'd around
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>With crimson toils, or in a river found,
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>High on the bank the deep-mouth'd hound appears,
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>Still opening, following still, where'er he steers;
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>The persecuted creature, to and fro,
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>Turns here and there, to scape his Umbrian foe:
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>Steep is th' ascent, and, if he gains the land,
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>The purple death is pitch'd along the strand.
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>His eager foe, determin'd to the chase,
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>Stretch'd at his length, gains ground at ev'ry pace;
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>Now to his beamy head he makes his way,
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>And now he holds, or thinks he holds, his prey:
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>Just at the pinch, the stag springs out with fear;
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>He bites the wind, and fills his sounding jaws with 
<A NAME="1128"></A>air:
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>The rocks, the lakes, the meadows ring with cries;
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>The mortal tumult mounts, and thunders in the skies.
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>Thus flies the Daunian prince, and, flying, blames
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>His tardy troops, and, calling by their names,
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>Demands his trusty sword. The Trojan threats
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>The realm with ruin, and their ancient seats
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR>To lay in ashes, if they dare supply
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>With arms or aid his vanquish'd enemy:
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>Thus menacing, he still pursues the course,
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR>With vigor, tho' diminish'd of his force.
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>Ten times already round the listed place
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>One chief had fled, and t' other giv'n the chase:
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR>No trivial prize is play'd; for on the life
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>Or death of Turnus now depends the strife.
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>Within the space, an olive tree had stood,
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR>A sacred shade, a venerable wood,
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR>For vows to Faunus paid, the Latins' guardian god.
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>Here hung the vests, and tablets were ingrav'd,
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>Of sinking mariners from shipwrack sav'd.
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR>With heedless hands the Trojans fell'd the tree,
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR>To make the ground inclos'd for combat free.
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR>Deep in the root, whether by fate, or chance,
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR>Or erring haste, the Trojan drove his lance;
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR>Then stoop'd, and tugg'd with force immense, to 
<A NAME="1153"></A>free
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR>Th' incumber'd spear from the tenacious tree;
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>That, whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain,
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR>His flying weapon might from far attain.
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR>Confus'd with fear, bereft of human aid,
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR>Then Turnus to the gods, and first to Faunus pray'd:
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR>"O Faunus, pity! and thou Mother Earth,
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR>Where I thy foster son receiv'd my birth,
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR>Hold fast the steel! If my religious hand
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>Your plant has honor'd, which your foes profan'd,
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR>Propitious hear my pious pray'r!" He said,
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR>Nor with successless vows invok'd their aid.
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR>Th' incumbent hero wrench'd, and pull'd, and strain'd;
<A NAME="1166"></A><BR>But still the stubborn earth the steel detain'd.
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR>Juturna took her time; and, while in vain
<A NAME="1168"></A><BR>He strove, assum'd Meticus' form again,
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR>And, in that imitated shape, restor'd
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR>To the despairing prince his Daunian sword.
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR>The Queen of Love, who, with disdain and grief,
<A NAME="1172"></A><BR>Saw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief,
<A NAME="1173"></A><BR>T' assert her offspring with a greater deed,
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR>From the tough root the ling'ring weapon freed.
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR>Once more erect, the rival chiefs advance:
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR>One trusts the sword, and one the pointed lance;
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR>And both resolv'd alike to try their fatal chance.
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR>Meantime imperial Jove to Juno spoke,
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR>Who from a shining cloud beheld the shock:
<A NAME="1180"></A><BR>"What new arrest, O Queen of Heav'n, is sent
<A NAME="1181"></A><BR>To stop the Fates now lab'ring in th' event?
<A NAME="1182"></A><BR>What farther hopes are left thee to pursue?
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR>Divine Aeneas, (and thou know'st it too,)
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR>Foredoom'd, to these celestial seats are due.
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR>What more attempts for Turnus can be made,
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>That thus thou ling'rest in this lonely shade?
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR>Is it becoming of the due respect
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR>And awful honor of a god elect,
<A NAME="1189"></A><BR>A wound unworthy of our state to feel,
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR>Patient of human hands and earthly steel?
<A NAME="1191"></A><BR>Or seems it just, the sister should restore
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR>A second sword, when one was lost before,
<A NAME="1193"></A><BR>And arm a conquer'd wretch against his conqueror?
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR>For what, without thy knowledge and avow,
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR>Nay more, thy dictate, durst Juturna do?
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR>At last, in deference to my love, forbear
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR>To lodge within thy soul this anxious care;
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR>Reclin'd upon my breast, thy grief unload:
<A NAME="1199"></A><BR>Who should relieve the goddess, but the god?
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR>Now all things to their utmost issue tend,
<A NAME="1201"></A><BR>Push'd by the Fates to their appointed
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR>While leave was giv'n thee, and a lawful hour
<A NAME="1203"></A><BR>For vengeance, wrath, and unresisted pow'r,
<A NAME="1204"></A><BR>Toss'd on the seas, thou couldst thy foes distress,
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR>And, driv'n ashore, with hostile arms oppress;
<A NAME="1206"></A><BR>Deform the royal house; and, from the side
<A NAME="1207"></A><BR>Of the just bridegroom, tear the plighted bride:
<A NAME="1208"></A><BR>Now cease at my command." The Thund'rer said;
<A NAME="1209"></A><BR>And, with dejected eyes, this answer Juno made:
<A NAME="1210"></A><BR>"Because your dread decree too well I knew,
<A NAME="1211"></A><BR>From Turnus and from earth unwilling I withdrew.
<A NAME="1212"></A><BR>Else should you not behold me here, alone,
<A NAME="1213"></A><BR>Involv'd in empty clouds, my friends bemoan,
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR>But, girt with vengeful flames, in open sight
<A NAME="1215"></A><BR>Engag'd against my foes in mortal fight.
<A NAME="1216"></A><BR>'T is true, Juturna mingled in the strife
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR>By my command, to save her brother's life-
<A NAME="1218"></A><BR>At least to try; but, by the Stygian lake,
<A NAME="1219"></A><BR>(The most religious oath the gods can take,)
<A NAME="1220"></A><BR>With this restriction, not to bend the bow,
<A NAME="1221"></A><BR>Or toss the spear, or trembling dart to throw.
<A NAME="1222"></A><BR>And now, resign'd to your superior might,
<A NAME="1223"></A><BR>And tir'd with fruitless toils, I loathe the fight.
<A NAME="1224"></A><BR>This let me beg (and this no fates withstand)
<A NAME="1225"></A><BR>Both for myself and for your father's land,
<A NAME="1226"></A><BR>That, when the nuptial bed shall bind the peace,
<A NAME="1227"></A><BR>(Which I, since you ordain, consent to bless,)
<A NAME="1228"></A><BR>The laws of either nation be the same;
<A NAME="1229"></A><BR>But let the Latins still retain their name,
<A NAME="1230"></A><BR>Speak the same language which they spoke before,
<A NAME="1231"></A><BR>Wear the same habits which their grandsires wore.
<A NAME="1232"></A><BR>Call them not Trojans: perish the renown
<A NAME="1233"></A><BR>And name of Troy, with that detested town.
<A NAME="1234"></A><BR>Latium be Latium still; let Alba reign
<A NAME="1235"></A><BR>And Rome's immortal majesty remain."
<A NAME="1236"></A><BR>Then thus the founder of mankind replies
<A NAME="1237"></A><BR>(Unruffled was his front, serene his eyes)
<A NAME="1238"></A><BR>"Can Saturn's issue, and heav'n's other heir,
<A NAME="1239"></A><BR>Such endless anger in her bosom bear?
<A NAME="1240"></A><BR>Be mistress, and your full desires obtain;
<A NAME="1241"></A><BR>But quench the choler you foment in vain.
<A NAME="1242"></A><BR>From ancient blood th' Ausonian people sprung,
<A NAME="1243"></A><BR>Shall keep their name, their habit, and their tongue.
<A NAME="1244"></A><BR>The Trojans to their customs shall be tied:
<A NAME="1245"></A><BR>I will, myself, their common rites provide;
<A NAME="1246"></A><BR>The natives shall command, the foreigners subside.
<A NAME="1247"></A><BR>All shall be Latium; Troy without a name;
<A NAME="1248"></A><BR>And her lost sons forget from whence they came.
<A NAME="1249"></A><BR>From blood so mix'd, a pious race shall flow,
<A NAME="1250"></A><BR>Equal to gods, excelling all below.
<A NAME="1251"></A><BR>No nation more respect to you shall pay,
<A NAME="1252"></A><BR>Or greater off'rings on your altars lay."
<A NAME="1253"></A><BR>Juno consents, well pleas'd that her desires
<A NAME="1254"></A><BR>Had found success, and from the cloud retires.
<A NAME="1255"></A><BR>The peace thus made, the Thund'rer next prepares
<A NAME="1256"></A><BR>To force the wat'ry goddess from the wars.
<A NAME="1257"></A><BR>Deep in the dismal regions void of light,
<A NAME="1258"></A><BR>Three daughters at a birth were born to Night:
<A NAME="1259"></A><BR>These their brown mother, brooding on her care,
<A NAME="1260"></A><BR>Indued with windy wings to flit in air,
<A NAME="1261"></A><BR>With serpents girt alike, and crown'd with hissing 
<A NAME="1262"></A>hair.
<A NAME="1263"></A><BR>In heav'n the Dirae call'd, and still at hand,
<A NAME="1264"></A><BR>Before the throne of angry Jove they stand,
<A NAME="1265"></A><BR>His ministers of wrath, and ready still
<A NAME="1266"></A><BR>The minds of mortal men with fears to fill,
<A NAME="1267"></A><BR>Whene'er the moody sire, to wreak his hate
<A NAME="1268"></A><BR>On realms or towns deserving of their fate,
<A NAME="1269"></A><BR>Hurls down diseases, death and deadly care,
<A NAME="1270"></A><BR>And terrifies the guilty world with war.
<A NAME="1271"></A><BR>One sister plague if these from heav'n he sent,
<A NAME="1272"></A><BR>To fright Juturna with a dire portent.
<A NAME="1273"></A><BR>The pest comes whirling down: by far more slow
<A NAME="1274"></A><BR>Springs the swift arrow from the Parthian bow,
<A NAME="1275"></A><BR>Or Cydon yew, when, traversing the skies,
<A NAME="1276"></A><BR>And drench'd in pois'nous juice, the sure destruction 
<A NAME="1277"></A>flies.
<A NAME="1278"></A><BR>With such a sudden and unseen a flight
<A NAME="1279"></A><BR>Shot thro' the clouds the daughter of the night.
<A NAME="1280"></A><BR>Soon as the field inclos'd she had in view,
<A NAME="1281"></A><BR>And from afar her destin'd quarry knew,
<A NAME="1282"></A><BR>Contracted, to the boding bird she turns,
<A NAME="1283"></A><BR>Which haunts the ruin'd piles and hallow'd urns,
<A NAME="1284"></A><BR>And beats about the tombs with nightly wings,
<A NAME="1285"></A><BR>Where songs obscene on sepulchers she sings.
<A NAME="1286"></A><BR>Thus lessen'd in her form, with frightful cries
<A NAME="1287"></A><BR>The Fury round unhappy Turnus flies,
<A NAME="1288"></A><BR>Flaps on his shield, and flutters o'er his eyes.
<A NAME="1289"></A><BR>A lazy chillness crept along his blood;
<A NAME="1290"></A><BR>Chok'd was his voice; his hair with horror stood.
<A NAME="1291"></A><BR>Juturna from afar beheld her fly,
<A NAME="1292"></A><BR>And knew th' ill omen, by her screaming cry
<A NAME="1293"></A><BR>And stridor of her wings. Amaz'd with fear,
<A NAME="1294"></A><BR>Her beauteous breast she beat, and rent her flowing 
<A NAME="1295"></A>hair.
<A NAME="1296"></A><BR>"Ah me!" she cries, "in this unequal strife
<A NAME="1297"></A><BR>What can thy sister more to save thy life?
<A NAME="1298"></A><BR>Weak as I am, can I, alas! contend
<A NAME="1299"></A><BR>In arms with that inexorable fiend?
<A NAME="1300"></A><BR>Now, now, I quit the field! forbear to fright
<A NAME="1301"></A><BR>My tender soul, ye baleful birds of night;
<A NAME="1302"></A><BR>The lashing of your wings I know too well,
<A NAME="1303"></A><BR>The sounding flight, and fun'ral screams of hell!
<A NAME="1304"></A><BR>These are the gifts you bring from haughty Jove,
<A NAME="1305"></A><BR>The worthy recompense of ravish'd love!
<A NAME="1306"></A><BR>Did he for this exempt my life from fate?
<A NAME="1307"></A><BR>O hard conditions of immortal state,
<A NAME="1308"></A><BR>Tho' born to death, not privileg'd to die,
<A NAME="1309"></A><BR>But forc'd to bear impos'd eternity!
<A NAME="1310"></A><BR>Take back your envious bribes, and let me go
<A NAME="1311"></A><BR>Companion to my brother's ghost below!
<A NAME="1312"></A><BR>The joys are vanish'd: nothing now remains,
<A NAME="1313"></A><BR>Of life immortal, but immortal pains.
<A NAME="1314"></A><BR>What earth will open her devouring womb,
<A NAME="1315"></A><BR>To rest a weary goddess in the tomb!"
<A NAME="1316"></A><BR>She drew a length of sighs; nor more she said,
<A NAME="1317"></A><BR>But in her azure mantle wrapp'd her head,
<A NAME="1318"></A><BR>Then plung'd into her stream, with deep despair,
<A NAME="1319"></A><BR>And her last sobs came bubbling up in air.
<A NAME="1320"></A><BR>Now stern Aeneas his weighty spear
<A NAME="1321"></A><BR>Against his foe, and thus upbraids his fear:
<A NAME="1322"></A><BR>"What farther subterfuge can Turnus find?
<A NAME="1323"></A><BR>What empty hopes are harbor'd in his mind?
<A NAME="1324"></A><BR>'T is not thy swiftness can secure thy flight;
<A NAME="1325"></A><BR>Not with their feet, but hands, the valiant fight.
<A NAME="1326"></A><BR>Vary thy shape in thousand forms, and dare
<A NAME="1327"></A><BR>What skill and courage can attempt in war;
<A NAME="1328"></A><BR>Wish for the wings of winds, to mount the sky;
<A NAME="1329"></A><BR>Or hid, within the hollow earth to lie!"
<A NAME="1330"></A><BR>The champion shook his head, and made this short 
<A NAME="1331"></A>reply:
<A NAME="1332"></A><BR>"No threats of thine my manly mind can move;
<A NAME="1333"></A><BR>'T is hostile heav'n I dread, and partial Jove."
<A NAME="1334"></A><BR>He said no more, but, with a sigh, repress'd
<A NAME="1335"></A><BR>The mighty sorrow in his swelling breast.
<A NAME="1336"></A><BR>Then, as he roll'd his troubled eyes around,
<A NAME="1337"></A><BR>An antique stone he saw, the common bound
<A NAME="1338"></A><BR>Of neighb'ring fields, and barrier of the ground;
<A NAME="1339"></A><BR>So vast, that twelve strong men of modern days
<A NAME="1340"></A><BR>Th' enormous weight from earth could hardly raise.
<A NAME="1341"></A><BR>He heav'd it at a lift, and, pois'd on high,
<A NAME="1342"></A><BR>Ran stagg'ring on against his enemy,
<A NAME="1343"></A><BR>But so disorder'd, that he scarcely knew
<A NAME="1344"></A><BR>His way, or what unwieldly weight he threw.
<A NAME="1345"></A><BR>His knocking knees are bent beneath the load,
<A NAME="1346"></A><BR>And shiv'ring cold congeals his vital blood.
<A NAME="1347"></A><BR>The stone drops from his arms, and, falling short
<A NAME="1348"></A><BR>For want of vigor, mocks his vain effort.
<A NAME="1349"></A><BR>And as, when heavy sleep has clos'd the sight,
<A NAME="1350"></A><BR>The sickly fancy labors in the night;
<A NAME="1351"></A><BR>We seem to run; and, destitute of force,
<A NAME="1352"></A><BR>Our sinking limbs forsake us in the course:
<A NAME="1353"></A><BR>In vain we heave for breath; in vain we cry;
<A NAME="1354"></A><BR>The nerves, unbrac'd, their usual strength deny;
<A NAME="1355"></A><BR>And on the tongue the falt'ring accents die:
<A NAME="1356"></A><BR>So Turnus far'd; whatever means he tried,
<A NAME="1357"></A><BR>All force of arms and points of art employ'd,
<A NAME="1358"></A><BR>The Fury flew athwart, and made th' endeavor void.
<A NAME="1359"></A><BR>A thousand various thoughts his soul confound;
<A NAME="1360"></A><BR>He star'd about, nor aid nor issue found;
<A NAME="1361"></A><BR>His own men stop the pass, and his own walls surround.
<A NAME="1362"></A><BR>Once more he pauses, and looks out again,
<A NAME="1363"></A><BR>And seeks the goddess charioteer in vain.
<A NAME="1364"></A><BR>Trembling he views the thund'ring chief advance,
<A NAME="1365"></A><BR>And brandishing aloft the deadly lance:
<A NAME="1366"></A><BR>Amaz'd he cow'rs beneath his conqu'ring foe,
<A NAME="1367"></A><BR>Forgets to ward, and waits the coming blow.
<A NAME="1368"></A><BR>Astonish'd while he stands, and fix'd with fear,
<A NAME="1369"></A><BR>Aim'd at his shield he sees th' impending spear.
<A NAME="1370"></A><BR>The hero measur'd first, with narrow view,
<A NAME="1371"></A><BR>The destin'd mark; and, rising as he threw,
<A NAME="1372"></A><BR>With its full swing the fatal weapon flew.
<A NAME="1373"></A><BR>Not with less rage the rattling thunder falls,
<A NAME="1374"></A><BR>Or stones from batt'ring-engines break the walls:
<A NAME="1375"></A><BR>Swift as a whirlwind, from an arm so strong,
<A NAME="1376"></A><BR>The lance drove on, and bore the death along.
<A NAME="1377"></A><BR>Naught could his sev'nfold shield the prince avail,
<A NAME="1378"></A><BR>Nor aught, beneath his arms, the coat of mail:
<A NAME="1379"></A><BR>It pierc'd thro' all, and with a grisly wound
<A NAME="1380"></A><BR>Transfix'd his thigh, and doubled him to ground.
<A NAME="1381"></A><BR>With groans the Latins rend the vaulted sky:
<A NAME="1382"></A><BR>Woods, hills, and valleys, to the voice reply.
<A NAME="1383"></A><BR>Now low on earth the lofty chief is laid,
<A NAME="1384"></A><BR>With eyes cast upward, and with arms display'd,
<A NAME="1385"></A><BR>And, recreant, thus to the proud victor pray'd:
<A NAME="1386"></A><BR>"I know my death deserv'd, nor hope to live:
<A NAME="1387"></A><BR>Use what the gods and thy good fortune give.
<A NAME="1388"></A><BR>Yet think, O think, if mercy may be shown-
<A NAME="1389"></A><BR>Thou hadst a father once, and hast a son-
<A NAME="1390"></A><BR>Pity my sire, now sinking to the grave;
<A NAME="1391"></A><BR>And for Anchises' sake old Daunus save!
<A NAME="1392"></A><BR>Or, if thy vow'd revenge pursue my death,
<A NAME="1393"></A><BR>Give to my friends my body void of breath!
<A NAME="1394"></A><BR>The Latian chiefs have seen me beg my life;
<A NAME="1395"></A><BR>Thine is the conquest, thine the royal wife:
<A NAME="1396"></A><BR>Against a yielded man, 't is mean ignoble strife."
<A NAME="1397"></A><BR>In deep suspense the Trojan seem'd to stand,
<A NAME="1398"></A><BR>And, just prepar'd to strike, repress'd his hand.
<A NAME="1399"></A><BR>He roll'd his eyes, and ev'ry moment felt
<A NAME="1400"></A><BR>His manly soul with more compassion melt;
<A NAME="1401"></A><BR>When, casting down a casual glance, he spied
<A NAME="1402"></A><BR>The golden belt that glitter'd on his side,
<A NAME="1403"></A><BR>The fatal spoils which haughty Turnus tore
<A NAME="1404"></A><BR>From dying Pallas, and in triumph wore.
<A NAME="1405"></A><BR>Then, rous'd anew to wrath, he loudly cries
<A NAME="1406"></A><BR>(Flames, while he spoke, came flashing from his 
<A NAME="1407"></A>eyes)
<A NAME="1408"></A><BR>"Traitor, dost thou, dost thou to grace pretend,
<A NAME="1409"></A><BR>Clad, as thou art, in trophies of my friend?
<A NAME="1410"></A><BR>To his sad soul a grateful off'ring go!
<A NAME="1411"></A><BR>'T is Pallas, Pallas gives this deadly blow."
<A NAME="1412"></A><BR>He rais'd his arm aloft, and, at the word,
<A NAME="1413"></A><BR>Deep in his bosom drove the shining sword.
<A NAME="1414"></A><BR>The streaming blood distain'd his arms around,
<A NAME="1415"></A><BR>And the disdainful soul came rushing thro' the wound.
