<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>All were attentive to the godlike man,
<A NAME="11"></A><BR>When from his lofty couch he thus began:
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>"Great queen, what you command me to relate
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>Renews the sad remembrance of our fate:
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>An empire from its old foundations rent,
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>And ev'ry woe the Trojans underwent;
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>A peopled city made a desart place;
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>All that I saw, and part of which I was:
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>Not ev'n the hardest of our foes could hear,
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Nor stern Ulysses tell without a tear.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>And now the latter watch of wasting night,
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>And setting stars, to kindly rest invite;
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>But, since you take such int'rest in our woe,
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>And Troy's disastrous end desire to know,
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>I will restrain my tears, and briefly tell
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>What in our last and fatal night befell.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>"By destiny compell'd, and in despair,
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>The Greeks grew weary of the tedious war,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>And by Minerva's aid a fabric rear'd,
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Which like a steed of monstrous height appear'd:
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>The sides were plank'd with pine; they feign'd it 
<A NAME="31"></A>made
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>For their return, and this the vow they paid.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Thus they pretend, but in the hollow side
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Selected numbers of their soldiers hide:
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>With inward arms the dire machine they load,
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>And iron bowels stuff the dark abode.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>In sight of Troy lies Tenedos, an isle
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>(While Fortune did on Priam's empire smile)
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Renown'd for wealth; but, since, a faithless bay,
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Where ships expos'd to wind and weather lay.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>There was their fleet conceal'd. We thought, for 
<A NAME="42"></A>Greece
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>Their sails were hoisted, and our fears release.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>The Trojans, coop'd within their walls so long,
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Unbar their gates, and issue in a throng,
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Like swarming bees, and with delight survey
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>The camp deserted, where the Grecians lay:
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>The quarters of the sev'ral chiefs they show'd;
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>Here Phoenix, here Achilles, made abode;
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Here join'd the battles; there the navy rode.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Part on the pile their wond'ring eyes employ:
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>The pile by Pallas rais'd to ruin Troy.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Thymoetes first ('t is doubtful whether hir'd,
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>Or so the Trojan destiny requir'd)
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Mov'd that the ramparts might be broken down,
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>To lodge the monster fabric in the town.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>But Capys, and the rest of sounder mind,
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>The fatal present to the flames designed,
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>Or to the wat'ry deep; at least to bore
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>The hollow sides, and hidden frauds explore.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>The giddy vulgar, as their fancies guide,
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>With noise say nothing, and in parts divide.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Laocoon, follow'd by a num'rous crowd,
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Ran from the fort, and cried, from far, aloud:
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>'O wretched countrymen! what fury reigns?
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>What more than madness has possess'd your brains?
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>Think you the Grecians from your coasts are gone?
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>And are Ulysses' arts no better known?
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>This hollow fabric either must inclose,
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>Within its blind recess, our secret foes;
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Or 't is an engine rais'd above the town,
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>T' o'erlook the walls, and then to batter down.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Somewhat is sure design'd, by fraud or force:
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Trust not their presents, nor admit the horse.'
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Thus having said, against the steed he threw
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>His forceful spear, which, hissing as flew,
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>Pierc'd thro' the yielding planks of jointed wood,
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>And trembling in the hollow belly stood.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>The sides, transpierc'd, return a rattling sound,
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>And groans of Greeks inclos'd come issuing thro' the 
<A NAME="81"></A>wound
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>And, had not Heav'n the fall of Troy design'd,
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Or had not men been fated to be blind,
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Enough was said and done t'inspire a better mind.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Then had our lances pierc'd the treach'rous wood,
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>And Ilian tow'rs and Priam's empire stood.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Meantime, with shouts, the Trojan shepherds bring
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>A captive Greek, in bands, before the king;
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Taken to take; who made himself their prey,
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>T' impose on their belief, and Troy betray;
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Fix'd on his aim, and obstinately bent
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>To die undaunted, or to circumvent.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>About the captive, tides of Trojans flow;
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>All press to see, and some insult the foe.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Now hear how well the Greeks their wiles disguis'd;
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>Behold a nation in a man compris'd.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>Trembling the miscreant stood, unarm'd and bound;
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>He star'd, and roll'd his haggard eyes around,
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>Then said: 'Alas! what earth remains, what sea
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Is open to receive unhappy me?
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>What fate a wretched fugitive attends,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Scorn'd by my foes, abandon'd by my friends?'
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>He said, and sigh'd, and cast a rueful eye:
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>Our pity kindles, and our passions die.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>We cheer youth to make his own defense,
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>And freely tell us what he was, and whence:
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>What news he could impart, we long to know,
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>And what to credit from a captive foe.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>"His fear at length dismiss'd, he said: 'Whate'er
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>My fate ordains, my words shall be sincere:
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>I neither can nor dare my birth disclaim;
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Greece is my country, Sinon is my name.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Tho' plung'd by Fortune's pow'r in misery,
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>'T is not in Fortune's pow'r to make me lie.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>If any chance has hither brought the name
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>Of Palamedes, not unknown to fame,
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>Who suffer'd from the malice of the times,
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Accus'd and sentenc'd for pretended crimes,
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Because these fatal wars he would prevent;
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Whose death the wretched Greeks too late lament-
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Me, then a boy, my father, poor and bare
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Of other means, committed to his care,
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>His kinsman and companion in the war.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>While Fortune favor'd, while his arms support
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>The cause, and rul'd the counsels, of the court,
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>I made some figure there; nor was my name
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Obscure, nor I without my share of fame.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>But when Ulysses, with fallacious arts,
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Had made impression in the people's hearts,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>And forg'd a treason in my patron's name
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>(I speak of things too far divulg'd by fame),
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>My kinsman fell. Then I, without support,
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>In private mourn'd his loss, and left the court.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Mad as I was, I could not bear his fate
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>With silent grief, but loudly blam'd the state,
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>And curs'd the direful author of my woes.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>'T was told again; and hence my ruin rose.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>I threaten'd, if indulgent Heav'n once more
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>Would land me safely on my native shore,
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>His death with double vengeance to restore.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>This mov'd the murderer's hate; and soon ensued
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Th' effects of malice from a man so proud.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Ambiguous rumors thro' the camp he spread,
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>And sought, by treason, my devoted head;
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>New crimes invented; left unturn'd no stone,
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>To make my guilt appear, and hide his own;
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Till Calchas was by force and threat'ning wrought-
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>But why- why dwell I on that anxious thought?
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>If on my nation just revenge you seek,
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>And 't is t' appear a foe, t' appear a Greek;
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Already you my name and country know;
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>Assuage your thirst of blood, and strike the blow:
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>My death will both the kingly brothers please,
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>And set insatiate Ithacus at ease.'
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>This fair unfinish'd tale, these broken starts,
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Rais'd expectations in our longing hearts:
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>Unknowing as we were in Grecian arts.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>His former trembling once again renew'd,
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>With acted fear, the villain thus pursued:
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>"'Long had the Grecians (tir'd with fruitless care,
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>And wearied with an unsuccessful war)
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Resolv'd to raise the siege, and leave the town;
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>And, had the gods permitted, they had gone;
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>But oft the wintry seas and southern winds
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Withstood their passage home, and chang'd their 
<A NAME="166"></A>minds.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>Portents and prodigies their souls amaz'd;
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>But most, when this stupendous pile was rais'd:
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Then flaming meteors, hung in air, were seen,
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>And thunders rattled thro' a sky serene.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Dismay'd, and fearful of some dire event,
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Eurypylus t' enquire their fate was sent.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>He from the gods this dreadful answer brought:
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>"O Grecians, when the Trojan shores you sought,
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Your passage with a virgin's blood was bought:
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>So must your safe return be bought again,
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>And Grecian blood once more atone the main."
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>The spreading rumor round the people ran;
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>All fear'd, and each believ'd himself the man.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Ulysses took th' advantage of their fright;
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Call'd Calchas, and produc'd in open sight:
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Then bade him name the wretch, ordain'd by fate
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>The public victim, to redeem the state.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>Already some presag'd the dire event,
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>And saw what sacrifice Ulysses meant.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>For twice five days the good old seer withstood
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>Th' intended treason, and was dumb to blood,
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>Till, tir'd, with endless clamors and pursuit
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Of Ithacus, he stood no longer mute;
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>But, as it was agreed, pronounc'd that I
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Was destin'd by the wrathful gods to die.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>All prais'd the sentence, pleas'd the storm should 
<A NAME="193"></A>fall
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>On one alone, whose fury threaten'd all.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>The dismal day was come; the priests prepare
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Their leaven'd cakes, and fillets for my hair.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>I follow'd nature's laws, and must avow
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>I broke my bonds and fled the fatal blow.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Hid in a weedy lake all night I lay,
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Secure of safety when they sail'd away.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>But now what further hopes for me remain,
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>To see my friends, or native soil, again;
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>My tender infants, or my careful sire,
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Whom they returning will to death require;
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Will perpetrate on them their first design,
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>And take the forfeit of their heads for mine?
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Which, O! if pity mortal minds can move,
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>If there be faith below, or gods above,
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>If innocence and truth can claim desert,
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Ye Trojans, from an injur'd wretch avert.'
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>"False tears true pity move; the king commands
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>To loose his fetters, and unbind his hands:
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Then adds these friendly words: 'Dismiss thy fears;
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Forget the Greeks; be mine as thou wert theirs.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>But truly tell, was it for force or guile,
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Or some religious end, you rais'd the pile?'
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Thus said the king. He, full of fraudful arts,
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>This well-invented tale for truth imparts:
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>'Ye lamps of heav'n!' he said, and lifted high
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>His hands now free, 'thou venerable sky!
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Inviolable pow'rs, ador'd with dread!
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Ye fatal fillets, that once bound this head!
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>Ye sacred altars, from whose flames I fled!
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>Be all of you adjur'd; and grant I may,
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>Without a crime, th' ungrateful Greeks betray,
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Reveal the secrets of the guilty state,
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>And justly punish whom I justly hate!
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>But you, O king, preserve the faith you gave,
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>If I, to save myself, your empire save.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>The Grecian hopes, and all th' attempts they made,
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Were only founded on Minerva's aid.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>But from the time when impious Diomede,
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>And false Ulysses, that inventive head,
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>Her fatal image from the temple drew,
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>The sleeping guardians of the castle slew,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Her virgin statue with their bloody hands
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Polluted, and profan'd her holy bands;
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>From thence the tide of fortune left their shore,
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>And ebb'd much faster than it flow'd before:
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>Their courage languish'd, as their hopes decay'd;
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>And Pallas, now averse, refus'd her aid.
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Nor did the goddess doubtfully declare
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Her alter'd mind and alienated care.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>When first her fatal image touch'd the ground,
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>She sternly cast her glaring eyes around,
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>That sparkled as they roll'd, and seem'd to threat:
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Her heav'nly limbs distill'd a briny sweat.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Thrice from the ground she leap'd, was seen to wield
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>Her brandish'd lance, and shake her horrid shield.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Then Calchas bade our host for flight
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>And hope no conquest from the tedious war,
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Till first they sail'd for Greece; with pray'rs 
<A NAME="253"></A>besought
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Her injur'd pow'r, and better omens brought.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>And now their navy plows the wat'ry main,
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>Yet soon expect it on your shores again,
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>With Pallas pleas'd; as Calchas did ordain.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>But first, to reconcile the blue-ey'd maid
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>For her stol'n statue and her tow'r betray'd,
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>Warn'd by the seer, to her offended name
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>We rais'd and dedicate this wondrous frame,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>So lofty, lest thro' your forbidden gates
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>It pass, and intercept our better fates:
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>For, once admitted there, our hopes are lost;
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>And Troy may then a new Palladium boast;
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>For so religion and the gods ordain,
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>That, if you violate with hands profane
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>Minerva's gift, your town in flames shall burn,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>(Which omen, O ye gods, on Graecia turn!)
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>But if it climb, with your assisting hands,
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>The Trojan walls, and in the city stands;
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Then Troy shall Argos and Mycenae burn,
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>And the reverse of fate on us return.'
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>"With such deceits he gain'd their easy hearts,
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Too prone to credit his perfidious arts.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>What Diomede, nor Thetis' greater son,
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>A thousand ships, nor ten years' siege, had done-
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>False tears and fawning words the city won.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>"A greater omen, and of worse portent,
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Did our unwary minds with fear torment,
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Concurring to produce the dire event.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>Laocoon, Neptune's priest by lot that year,
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>With solemn pomp then sacrific'd a steer;
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>When, dreadful to behold, from sea we spied
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Two serpents, rank'd abreast, the seas divide,
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>And smoothly sweep along the swelling tide.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Their flaming crests above the waves they show;
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Their bellies seem to burn the seas below;
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Their speckled tails advance to steer their course,
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>And on the sounding shore the flying billows force.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>And now the strand, and now the plain they held;
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Their ardent eyes with bloody streaks were fill'd;
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Their nimble tongues they brandish'd as they came,
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>And lick'd their hissing jaws, that sputter'd flame.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>We fled amaz'd; their destin'd way they take,
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>And to Laocoon and his children make;
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>And first around the tender boys they wind,
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>Then with their sharpen'd fangs their limbs and bodies 
<A NAME="299"></A>grind.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>The wretched father, running to their aid
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>With pious haste, but vain, they next invade;
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Twice round his waist their winding volumes roll'd;
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>And twice about his gasping throat they fold.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>The priest thus doubly chok'd, their crests divide,
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>And tow'ring o'er his head in triumph ride.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>With both his hands he labors at the knots;
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>His holy fillets the blue venom blots;
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>His roaring fills the flitting air around.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Thus, when an ox receives a glancing wound,
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>He breaks his bands, the fatal altar flies,
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>And with loud bellowings breaks the yielding skies.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Their tasks perform'd, the serpents quit their prey,
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>And to the tow'r of Pallas make their way:
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Couch'd at her feet, they lie protected there
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>By her large buckler and protended spear.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Amazement seizes all; the gen'ral cry
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>Proclaims Laocoon justly doom'd to die,
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Whose hand the will of Pallas had withstood,
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>And dared to violate the sacred wood.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>All vote t' admit the steed, that vows be paid
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>And incense offer'd to th' offended maid.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>A spacious breach is made; the town lies bare;
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Some hoisting-levers, some the wheels prepare
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>And fasten to the horse's feet; the rest
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>With cables haul along th' unwieldly beast.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Each on his fellow for assistance calls;
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>At length the fatal fabric mounts the walls,
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Big with destruction. Boys with chaplets crown'd,
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>And choirs of virgins, sing and dance around.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Thus rais'd aloft, and then descending down,
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>It enters o'er our heads, and threats the town.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>O sacred city, built by hands divine!
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>O valiant heroes of the Trojan line!
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Four times he struck: as oft the clashing sound
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Of arms was heard, and inward groans rebound.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Yet, mad with zeal, and blinded with our fate,
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>We haul along the horse in solemn state;
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Then place the dire portent within the tow'r.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>Cassandra cried, and curs'd th' unhappy hour;
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Foretold our fate; but, by the god's decree,
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>All heard, and none believ'd the prophecy.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>With branches we the fanes adorn, and waste,
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>In jollity, the day ordain'd to be the last.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Meantime the rapid heav'ns roll'd down the light,
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>And on the shaded ocean rush'd the night;
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>Our men, secure, nor guards nor sentries held,
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>But easy sleep their weary limbs compell'd.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>The Grecians had embark'd their naval pow'rs
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>From Tenedos, and sought our well-known shores,
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>Safe under covert of the silent night,
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>And guided by th' imperial galley's light;
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>When Sinon, favor'd by the partial gods,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Unlock'd the horse, and op'd his dark abodes;
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>Restor'd to vital air our hidden foes,
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Who joyful from their long confinement rose.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Tysander bold, and Sthenelus their guide,
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>And dire Ulysses down the cable slide:
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Then Thoas, Athamas, and Pyrrhus haste;
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Nor was the Podalirian hero last,
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Nor injur'd Menelaus, nor the fam'd
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Epeus, who the fatal engine fram'd.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>A nameless crowd succeed; their forces join
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>T' invade the town, oppress'd with sleep and wine.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>Those few they find awake first meet their fate;
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Then to their fellows they unbar the gate.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>"'T was in the dead of night, when sleep repairs
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>Our bodies worn with toils, our minds with cares,
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>When Hector's ghost before my sight appears:
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>A bloody shroud he seem'd, and bath'd in tears;
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Such as he was, when, by Pelides slain,
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Thessalian coursers dragg'd him o'er the plain.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>Swoln were his feet, as when the thongs were thrust
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>Thro' the bor'd holes; his body black with dust;
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Unlike that Hector who return'd from toils
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>Of war, triumphant, in Aeacian spoils,
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Or him who made the fainting Greeks retire,
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>And launch'd against their navy Phrygian fire.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>His hair and beard stood stiffen'd with his gore;
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>And all the wounds he for his country bore
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>Now stream'd afresh, and with new purple ran.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>I wept to see the visionary man,
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>And, while my trance continued, thus began:
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>'O light of Trojans, and support of Troy,
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>Thy father's champion, and thy country's joy!
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>O, long expected by thy friends! from whence
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Art thou so late return'd for our defense?
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>Do we behold thee, wearied as we are
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>With length of labors, and with toils of war?
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>After so many fun'rals of thy own
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Art thou restor'd to thy declining town?
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>But say, what wounds are these? What new disgrace
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Deforms the manly features of thy face?'
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>"To this the specter no reply did frame,
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>But answer'd to the cause for which he came,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>And, groaning from the bottom of his breast,
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>This warning in these mournful words express'd:
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>'O goddess-born! escape, by timely flight,
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>The flames and horrors of this fatal night.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>The foes already have possess'd the wall;
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Troy nods from high, and totters to her fall.
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Enough is paid to Priam's royal name,
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>More than enough to duty and to fame.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>If by a mortal hand my father's throne
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>Could be defended, 't was by mine alone.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>Now Troy to thee commends her future state,
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>And gives her gods companions of thy fate:
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>From their assistance walls expect,
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Which, wand'ring long, at last thou shalt erect.'
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>He said, and brought me, from their blest abodes,
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>The venerable statues of the gods,
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>With ancient Vesta from the sacred choir,
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>The wreaths and relics of th' immortal fire.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>"Now peals of shouts come thund'ring from afar,
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Cries, threats, and loud laments, and mingled war:
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>The noise approaches, tho' our palace stood
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>Aloof from streets, encompass'd with a wood.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>Louder, and yet more loud, I hear th' alarms
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>Of human cries distinct, and clashing arms.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Fear broke my slumbers; I no longer stay,
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>But mount the terrace, thence the town survey,
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>And hearken what the frightful sounds convey.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Thus, when a flood of fire by wind is borne,
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>Crackling it rolls, and mows the standing corn;
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Or deluges, descending on the plains,
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Sweep o'er the yellow year, destroy the pains
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Of lab'ring oxen and the peasant's gains;
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Unroot the forest oaks, and bear away
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>Flocks, folds, and trees, and undistinguish'd prey:
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>The shepherd climbs the cliff, and sees from far
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>The wasteful ravage of the wat'ry war.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Then Hector's faith was manifestly clear'd,
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>And Grecian frauds in open light appear'd.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>The palace of Deiphobus ascends
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>In smoky flames, and catches on his friends.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Ucalegon burns next: the seas are bright
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>With splendor not their own, and shine with Trojan 
<A NAME="437"></A>light.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>New clamors and new clangors now arise,
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>The sound of trumpets mix'd with fighting cries.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>With frenzy seiz'd, I run to meet th' alarms,
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Resolv'd on death, resolv'd to die in arms,
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>But first to gather friends, with them t' oppose
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>(If fortune favor'd) and repel the foes;
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Spurr'd by my courage, by my country fir'd,
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>With sense of honor and revenge inspir'd.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>"Pantheus, Apollo's priest, a sacred name,
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Had scap'd the Grecian swords, and pass'd the flame:
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>With relics loaden. to my doors he fled,
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>And by the hand his tender grandson led.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>'What hope, O Pantheus? whither can we run?
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Where make a stand? and what may yet be done?'
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>Scarce had I said, when Pantheus, with a groan:
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>'Troy is no more, and Ilium was a town!
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>The fatal day, th' appointed hour, is come,
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>When wrathful Jove's irrevocable doom
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Transfers the Trojan state to Grecian hands.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>The fire consumes the town, the foe commands;
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>And armed hosts, an unexpected force,
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Break from the bowels of the fatal horse.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Within the gates, proud Sinon throws about
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>The flames; and foes for entrance press without,
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>With thousand others, whom I fear to name,
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>More than from Argos or Mycenae came.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>To sev'ral posts their parties they divide;
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>Some block the narrow streets, some scour the wide:
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>The bold they kill, th' unwary they surprise;
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Who fights finds death, and death finds him who 
<A NAME="468"></A>flies.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>The warders of the gate but scarce maintain
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>Th' unequal combat, and resist in vain.'
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>"I heard; and Heav'n, that well-born souls inspires,
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>Prompts me thro' lifted swords and rising fires
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>To run where clashing arms and clamor calls,
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>And rush undaunted to defend the walls.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Ripheus and Iph'itus by my side engage,
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>For valor one renown'd, and one for age.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Dymas and Hypanis by moonlight knew
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>My motions and my mien, and to my party drew;
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>With young Coroebus, who by love was led
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>To win renown and fair Cassandra's bed,
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>And lately brought his troops to Priam's aid,
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>Forewarn'd in vain by the prophetic maid.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Whom when I saw resolv'd in arms to fall,
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>And that one spirit animated all:
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>'Brave souls!' said I,- 'but brave, alas! in vain-
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Come, finish what our cruel fates ordain.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>You see the desp'rate state of our affairs,
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>And heav'n's protecting pow'rs are deaf to pray'rs.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>The passive gods behold the Greeks defile
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Their temples, and abandon to the spoil
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>Their own abodes: we, feeble few, conspire
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>To save a sinking town, involv'd in fire.
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Then let us fall, but fall amidst our foes:
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Despair of life the means of living shows.'
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>So bold a speech incourag'd their desire
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Of death, and added fuel to their fire.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>"As hungry wolves, with raging appetite,
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>Scour thro' the fields, nor fear the stormy night-
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>Their whelps at home expect the promis'd food,
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>And long to temper their dry chaps in blood-
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>So rush'd we forth at once; resolv'd to die,
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>Resolv'd, in death, the last extremes to try.
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>We leave the narrow lanes behind, and dare
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>Th' unequal combat in the public square:
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Night was our friend; our leader was despair.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>What tongue can tell the slaughter of that night?
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>What eyes can weep the sorrows and affright?
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>An ancient and imperial city falls:
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>The streets are fill'd with frequent funerals;
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>Houses and holy temples float in blood,
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>And hostile nations make a common flood.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>Not only Trojans fall; but, in their turn,
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>The vanquish'd triumph, and the victors mourn.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>Ours take new courage from despair and night:
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>Confus'd the fortune is, confus'd the fight.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>All parts resound with tumults, plaints, and fears;
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>And grisly Death in sundry shapes appears.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Androgeos fell among us, with his band,
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Who thought us Grecians newly come to land.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>'From whence,' said he, 'my friends, this long delay?
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>You loiter, while the spoils are borne away:
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>Our ships are laden with the Trojan store;
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>And you, like truants, come too late ashore.'
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>He said, but soon corrected his mistake,
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>Found, by the doubtful answers which we make:
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Amaz'd, he would have shunn'd th' unequal fight;
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>But we, more num'rous, intercept his flight.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>As when some peasant, in a bushy brake,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>Has with unwary footing press'd a snake;
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>He starts aside, astonish'd, when he spies
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>His rising crest, blue neck, and rolling eyes;
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>So from our arms surpris'd Androgeos flies.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>In vain; for him and his we compass'd round,
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>Possess'd with fear, unknowing of the ground,
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>And of their lives an easy conquest found.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>Thus Fortune on our first endeavor smil'd.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>Coroebus then, with youthful hopes beguil'd,
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Swoln with success, and a daring mind,
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>This new invention fatally design'd.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>'My friends,' said he, 'since Fortune shows the 
<A NAME="541"></A>way,
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>'T is fit we should th' auspicious guide obey.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>For what has she these Grecian arms bestow'd,
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>But their destruction, and the Trojans' good?
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Then change we shields, and their devices bear:
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>Let fraud supply the want of force in war.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>They find us arms.' This said, himself he dress'd
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>In dead Androgeos' spoils, his upper vest,
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>His painted buckler, and his plumy crest.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>Thus Ripheus, Dymas, all the Trojan train,
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Lay down their own attire, and strip the slain.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Mix'd with the Greeks, we go with ill presage,
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>Flatter'd with hopes to glut our greedy rage;
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Unknown, assaulting whom we blindly meet,
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>And strew with Grecian carcasses the street.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>Thus while their straggling parties we defeat,
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Some to the shore and safer ships retreat;
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>And some, oppress'd with more ignoble fear,
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>Remount the hollow horse, and pant in secret there.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>"But, ah! what use of valor can be made,
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>When heav'n's propitious pow'rs refuse their aid!
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Behold the royal prophetess, the fair
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>Cassandra, dragg'd by her dishevel'd hair,
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Whom not Minerva's shrine, nor sacred bands,
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>In safety could protect from sacrilegious hands:
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>On heav'n she cast her eyes, she sigh'd, she cried-
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>'T was all she could- her tender arms were tied.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>So sad a sight Coroebus could not bear;
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>But, fir'd with rage, distracted with despair,
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Amid the barb'rous ravishers he flew:
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Our leader's rash example we pursue.
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>But storms of stones, from the proud temple's height,
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Pour down, and on our batter'd helms alight:
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>We from our friends receiv'd this fatal blow,
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>Who thought us Grecians, as we seem'd in show.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>They aim at the mistaken crests, from high;
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>And ours beneath the pond'rous ruin lie.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>Then, mov'd with anger and disdain, to see
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Their troops dispers'd, the royal virgin free,
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>The Grecians rally, and their pow'rs unite,
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>With fury charge us, and renew the fight.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>The brother kings with Ajax join their force,
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>And the whole squadron of Thessalian horse.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>"Thus, when the rival winds their quarrel try,
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Contending for the kingdom of the sky,
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>South, east, and west, on airy coursers borne;
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>The whirlwind gathers, and the woods are torn:
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Then Nereus strikes the deep; the billows rise,
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>And, mix'd with ooze and sand, pollute the skies.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>The troops we squander'd first again appear
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>From several quarters, and enclose the rear.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>They first observe, and to the rest betray,
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Our diff'rent speech; our borrow'd arms survey.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Oppress'd with odds, we fall; Coroebus first,
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>At Pallas' altar, by Peneleus pierc'd.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Then Ripheus follow'd, in th' unequal fight;
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>Just of his word, observant of the right:
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Heav'n thought not so. Dymas their fate attends,
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>With Hypanis, mistaken by their friends.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Nor, Pantheus, thee, thy miter, nor the bands
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>Of awful Phoebus, sav'd from impious hands.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Ye Trojan flames, your testimony bear,
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>What I perform'd, and what I suffer'd there;
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>No sword avoiding in the fatal strife,
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Expos'd to death, and prodigal of life;
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Witness, ye heavens! I live not by my fault:
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>I strove to have deserv'd the death I sought.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>But, when I could not fight, and would have died,
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Borne off to distance by the growing tide,
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Old Iphitus and I were hurried thence,
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>With Pelias wounded, and without defense.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>New clamors from th' invested palace ring:
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>We run to die, or disengage the king.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>So hot th' assault, so high the tumult rose,
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>While ours defend, and while the Greeks oppose
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>As all the Dardan and Argolic race
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Had been contracted in that narrow space;
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Or as all Ilium else were void of fear,
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>And tumult, war, and slaughter, only there.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>Their targets in a tortoise cast, the foes,
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Secure advancing, to the turrets rose:
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Some mount the scaling ladders; some, more bold,
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>Swerve upwards, and by posts and pillars hold;
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>Their left hand gripes their bucklers in th' ascent,
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>While with their right they seize the battlement.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>From their demolish'd tow'rs the Trojans throw
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>Huge heaps of stones, that, falling, crush the foe;
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>And heavy beams and rafters from the sides
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>(Such arms their last necessity provides)
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>And gilded roofs, come tumbling from on high,
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>The marks of state and ancient royalty.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>The guards below, fix'd in the pass, attend
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>The charge undaunted, and the gate defend.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>Renew'd in courage with recover'd breath,
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>A second time we ran to tempt our death,
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>To clear the palace from the foe, succeed
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>The weary living, and revenge the dead.
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>"A postern door, yet unobserv'd and free,
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Join'd by the length of a blind gallery,
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>To the king's closet led: a way well known
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>To Hector's wife, while Priam held the throne,
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>Thro' which she brought Astyanax, unseen,
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>To cheer his grandsire and his grandsire's queen.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Thro' this we pass, and mount the tow'r, from whence
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>With unavailing arms the Trojans make defense.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>From this the trembling king had oft descried
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>The Grecian camp, and saw their navy ride.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Beams from its lofty height with swords we hew,
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>Then, wrenching with our hands, th' assault renew;
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>And, where the rafters on the columns meet,
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>We push them headlong with our arms and feet.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>The lightning flies not swifter than the fall,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Nor thunder louder than the ruin'd wall:
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>Down goes the top at once; the Greeks beneath
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>Are piecemeal torn, or pounded into death.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Yet more succeed, and more to death are sent;
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>We cease not from above, nor they below relent.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>Before the gate stood Pyrrhus, threat'ning loud,
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>With glitt'ring arms conspicuous in the crowd.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>So shines, renew'd in youth, the crested snake,
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>Who slept the winter in a thorny brake,
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>And, casting off his slough when spring returns,
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>Now looks aloft, and with new glory burns;
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>Restor'd with poisonous herbs, his ardent sides
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Reflect the sun; and rais'd on spires he rides;
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>High o'er the grass, hissing he rolls along,
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>And brandishes by fits his forky tongue.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>Proud Periphas, and fierce Automedon,
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>His father's charioteer, together run
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>To force the gate; the Scyrian infantry
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>Rush on in crowds, and the barr'd passage free.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Ent'ring the court, with shouts the skies they rend;
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>And flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend.
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>Himself, among the foremost, deals his blows,
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>And with his ax repeated strokes bestows
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>On the strong doors; then all their shoulders ply,
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>Till from the posts the brazen hinges fly.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>He hews apace; the double bars at length
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Yield to his ax and unresisted strength.
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>A mighty breach is made: the rooms conceal'd
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Appear, and all the palace is reveal'd;
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>The halls of audience, and of public state,
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>And where the lonely queen in secret sate.
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Arm'd soldiers now by trembling maids are seen,
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>With not a door, and scarce a space, between.
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>The house is fill'd with loud laments and cries,
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>And shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies;
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>The fearful matrons run from place to place,
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>And kiss the thresholds, and the posts embrace.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>The fatal work inhuman Pyrrhus plies,
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>And all his father sparkles in his eyes;
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>Nor bars, nor fighting guards, his force sustain:
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>The bars are broken, and the guards are slain.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>In rush the Greeks, and all the apartments fill;
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>Those few defendants whom they find, they kill.
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Not with so fierce a rage the foaming flood
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>Roars, when he finds his rapid course withstood;
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>Bears down the dams with unresisted sway,
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>And sweeps the cattle and the cots away.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>These eyes beheld him when he march'd between
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>The brother kings: I saw th' unhappy queen,
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>The hundred wives, and where old Priam stood,
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>To stain his hallow'd altar with his brood.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>The fifty nuptial beds (such hopes had he,
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>So large a promise, of a progeny),
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>The posts, of plated gold, and hung with spoils,
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Fell the reward of the proud victor's toils.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Where'er the raging fire had left a space,
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>The Grecians enter and possess the place.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>"Perhaps you may of Priam's fate enquire.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>He, when he saw his regal town on fire,
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>His ruin'd palace, and his ent'ring foes,
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>On ev'ry side inevitable woes,
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>In arms, disus'd, invests his limbs, decay'd,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>Like them, with age; a late and useless aid.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>His feeble shoulders scarce the weight sustain;
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>Loaded, not arm'd, he creeps along with pain,
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Despairing of success, ambitious to be slain!
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>Uncover'd but by heav'n, there stood in view
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>An altar; near the hearth a laurel grew,
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>Dodder'd with age, whose boughs encompass round
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>The household gods, and shade the holy ground.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Here Hecuba, with all her helpless train
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>Of dames, for shelter sought, but sought in vain.
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>Driv'n like a flock of doves along the sky,
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Their images they hug, and to their altars fly.
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>The Queen, when she beheld her trembling lord,
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>And hanging by his side a heavy sword,
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>'What rage,' she cried, 'has seiz'd my husband's 
<A NAME="730"></A>mind?
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>What arms are these, and to what use design'd?
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>These times want other aids! Were Hector here,
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Ev'n Hector now in vain, like Priam, would appear.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>With us, one common shelter thou shalt find,
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Or in one common fate with us be join'd.'
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>She said, and with a last salute embrac'd
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>The poor old man, and by the laurel plac'd.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>Behold! Polites, one of Priam's sons,
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>Pursued by Pyrrhus, there for safety runs.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>Thro' swords and foes, amaz'd and hurt, he flies
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>Thro' empty courts and open galleries.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>Him Pyrrhus, urging with his lance, pursues,
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>And often reaches, and his thrusts renews.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>The youth, transfix'd, with lamentable cries,
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Expires before his wretched parent's eyes:
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>Whom gasping at his feet when Priam saw,
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>The fear of death gave place to nature's law;
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>And, shaking more with anger than with age,
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>'The gods,' said he, 'requite thy brutal rage!
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>As sure they will, barbarian, sure they must,
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>If there be gods in heav'n, and gods be just-
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>Who tak'st in wrongs an insolent delight;
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>With a son's death t' infect a father's sight.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>Not he, whom thou and lying fame conspire
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>To call thee his- not he, thy vaunted sire,
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>Thus us'd my wretched age: the gods he fear'd,
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>The laws of nature and of nations heard.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>He cheer'd my sorrows, and, for sums of gold,
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>The bloodless carcass of my Hector sold;
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Pitied the woes a parent underwent,
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>And sent me back in safety from his tent.'
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>"This said, his feeble hand a javelin threw,
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>Which, flutt'ring, seem'd to loiter as it flew:
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>Just, and but barely, to the mark it held,
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>And faintly tinkled on the brazen shield.
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>"Then Pyrrhus thus: 'Go thou from me to fate,
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>And to my father my foul deeds relate.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>Now die!' With that he dragg'd the trembling sire,
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Slidd'ring thro' clotter'd blood and holy mire,
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>(The mingled paste his murder'd son had made,)
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>Haul'd from beneath the violated shade,
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>And on the sacred pile the royal victim laid.
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>His right hand held his bloody falchion bare,
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>His left he twisted in his hoary hair;
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>Then, with a speeding thrust, his heart he found:
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>The lukewarm blood came rushing thro' the wound,
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>And sanguine streams distain'd the sacred ground.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>Thus Priam fell, and shar'd one common fate
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>With Troy in ashes, and his ruin'd state:
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>He, who the scepter of all Asia sway'd,
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obey'd.
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>On the bleak shore now lies th' abandon'd king,
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>A headless carcass, and a nameless thing.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>"Then, not before, I felt my cruddled blood
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>Congeal with fear, my hair with horror stood:
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>My father's image fill'd my pious mind,
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>Lest equal years might equal fortune find.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>Again I thought on my forsaken wife,
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>And trembled for my son's abandon'd life.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>I look'd about, but found myself alone,
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>Deserted at my need! My friends were gone.
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>Some spent with toil, some with despair oppress'd,
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>Leap'd headlong from the heights; the flames consum'd the 
<A NAME="794"></A>rest.
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>Thus, wand'ring in my way, without a guide,
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>The graceless Helen in the porch I spied
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>Of Vesta's temple; there she lurk'd alone;
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>Muffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown:
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>But, by the flames that cast their blaze around,
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>That common bane of Greece and Troy I found.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>For Ilium burnt, she dreads the Trojan sword;
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>More dreads the vengeance of her injur'd lord;
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>Ev'n by those gods who refug'd her abhorr'd.
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>Trembling with rage, the strumpet I regard,
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>Resolv'd to give her guilt the due reward:
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>'Shall she triumphant sail before the wind,
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>And leave in flames unhappy Troy behind?
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>Shall she her kingdom and her friends review,
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>In state attended with a captive crew,
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>While unreveng'd the good old Priam falls,
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>And Grecian fires consume the Trojan walls?
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>For this the Phrygian fields and Xanthian flood
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>Were swell'd with bodies, and were drunk with blood?
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>'T is true, a soldier can small honor gain,
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>And boast no conquest, from a woman slain:
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>Yet shall the fact not pass without applause,
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>Of vengeance taken in so just a cause;
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>The punish'd crime shall set my soul at ease,
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>And murm'ring manes of my friends appease.'
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>Thus while I rave, a gleam of pleasing light
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>Spread o'er the place; and, shining heav'nly bright,
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>My mother stood reveal'd before my sight
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>Never so radiant did her eyes appear;
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Not her own star confess'd a light so clear:
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>Great in her charms, as when on gods above
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>She looks, and breathes herself into their love.
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>She held my hand, the destin'd blow to break;
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>Then from her rosy lips began to speak:
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>'My son, from whence this madness, this neglect
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>Of my commands, and those whom I protect?
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>Why this unmanly rage? Recall to mind
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>Whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>Look if your helpless father yet survive,
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>Or if Ascanius or Creusa live.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>Around your house the greedy Grecians err;
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>And these had perish'd in the nightly war,
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>But for my presence and protecting care.
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>Not Helen's face, nor Paris, was in fault;
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>But by the gods was this destruction brought.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Now cast your eyes around, while I dissolve
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>The mists and films that mortal eyes involve,
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>Purge from your sight the dross, and make you see
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>The shape of each avenging deity.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>Enlighten'd thus, my just commands fulfil,
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>Nor fear obedience to your mother's will.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>Where yon disorder'd heap of ruin lies,
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>Stones rent from stones; where clouds of dust arise-
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>Amid that smother Neptune holds his place,
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>Below the wall's foundation drives his mace,
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>And heaves the building from the solid base.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>Look where, in arms, imperial Juno stands
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>Full in the Scaean gate, with loud commands,
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>Urging on shore the tardy Grecian bands.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>See! Pallas, of her snaky buckler proud,
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>Bestrides the tow'r, refulgent thro' the cloud:
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>See! Jove new courage to the foe supplies,
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>And arms against the town the partial deities.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>Haste hence, my son; this fruitless labor end:
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>Haste, where your trembling spouse and sire attend:
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>Haste; and a mother's care your passage shall befriend.'
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>She said, and swiftly vanish'd from my sight,
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>Obscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night.
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>I look'd, I listen'd; dreadful sounds I hear;
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>And the dire forms of hostile gods appear.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>Troy sunk in flames I saw (nor could prevent),
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>And Ilium from its old foundations rent;
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>Rent like a mountain ash, which dar'd the winds,
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>And stood the sturdy strokes of lab'ring hinds.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>About the roots the cruel ax resounds;
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>The stumps are pierc'd with oft-repeated wounds:
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>The war is felt on high; the nodding crown
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>Now threats a fall, and throws the leafy honors 
<A NAME="873"></A>down.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>To their united force it yields, tho' late,
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>And mourns with mortal groans th' approaching fate:
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>The roots no more their upper load sustain;
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>But down she falls, and spreads a ruin thro' the 
<A NAME="878"></A>plain.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>"Descending thence, I scape thro' foes and fire:
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>Before the goddess, foes and flames retire.
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>Arriv'd at home, he, for whose only sake,
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>Or most for his, such toils I undertake,
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>The good Anchises, whom, by timely flight,
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>I purpos'd to secure on Ida's height,
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>Refus'd the journey, resolute to die
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>And add his fun'rals to the fate of Troy,
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>Rather than exile and old age sustain.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>'Go you, whose blood runs warm in ev'ry vein.
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>Had Heav'n decreed that I should life enjoy,
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>Heav'n had decreed to save unhappy Troy.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>'T is, sure, enough, if not too much, for one,
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>Twice to have seen our Ilium overthrown.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>Make haste to save the poor remaining crew,
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>And give this useless corpse a long adieu.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>These weak old hands suffice to stop my breath;
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>At least the pitying foes will aid my death,
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>To take my spoils, and leave my body bare:
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>As for my sepulcher, let Heav'n take care.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>'T is long since I, for my celestial wife
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>Loath'd by the gods, have dragg'd a ling'ring life;
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>Since ev'ry hour and moment I expire,
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>Blasted from heav'n by Jove's avenging fire.'
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>This oft repeated, he stood fix'd to die:
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>Myself, my wife, my son, my family,
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>Intreat, pray, beg, and raise a doleful cry-
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>'What, will he still persist, on death resolve,
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>And in his ruin all his house involve!'
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>He still persists his reasons to maintain;
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>Our pray'rs, our tears, our loud laments, are vain.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>"Urg'd by despair, again I go to try
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>The fate of arms, resolv'd in fight to die:
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>'What hope remains, but what my death must give?
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>Can I, without so dear a father, live?
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>You term it prudence, what I baseness call:
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>Could such a word from such a parent fall?
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>If Fortune please, and so the gods ordain,
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>That nothing should of ruin'd Troy remain,
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>And you conspire with Fortune to be slain,
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>The way to death is wide, th' approaches near:
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>For soon relentless Pyrrhus will appear,
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>Reeking with Priam's blood- the wretch who slew
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>The son (inhuman) in the father's view,
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>And then the sire himself to the dire altar drew.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>O goddess mother, give me back to Fate;
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>Your gift was undesir'd, and came too late!
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>Did you, for this, unhappy me convey
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>Thro' foes and fires, to see my house a prey?
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>Shall I my father, wife, and son behold,
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>Welt'ring in blood, each other's arms infold?
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>Haste! gird my sword, tho' spent and overcome:
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>'T is the last summons to receive our doom.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>I hear thee, Fate; and I obey thy call!
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>Not unreveng'd the foe shall see my fall.
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>Restore me to the yet unfinish'd fight:
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>My death is wanting to conclude the night.'
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>Arm'd once again, my glitt'ring sword I wield,
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>While th' other hand sustains my weighty shield,
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>And forth I rush to seek th' abandon'd field.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>I went; but sad Creusa stopp'd my way,
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>And cross the threshold in my passage lay,
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>Embrac'd my knees, and, when I would have gone,
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>Shew'd me my feeble sire and tender son:
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>'If death be your design, at least,' said she,
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>'Take us along to share your destiny.
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>If any farther hopes in arms remain,
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>This place, these pledges of your love, maintain.
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>To whom do you expose your father's life,
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>Your son's, and mine, your now forgotten wife!'
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>While thus she fills the house with clam'rous cries,
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>Our hearing is diverted by our eyes:
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>For, while I held my son, in the short space
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>Betwixt our kisses and our last embrace;
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>Strange to relate, from young Iulus' head
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>A lambent flame arose, which gently spread
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>Around his brows, and on his temples fed.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>Amaz'd, with running water we prepare
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>To quench the sacred fire, and slake his hair;
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>But old Anchises, vers'd in omens, rear'd
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>His hands to heav'n, and this request preferr'd:
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>'If any vows, almighty Jove, can bend
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>Thy will; if piety can pray'rs commend,
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>Confirm the glad presage which thou art pleas'd to 
<A NAME="963"></A>send.'
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>Scarce had he said, when, on our left, we hear
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>A peal of rattling thunder roll in air:
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>There shot a streaming lamp along the sky,
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>Which on the winged lightning seem'd to fly;
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>From o'er the roof the blaze began to move,
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>And, trailing, vanish'd in th' Idaean grove.
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>It swept a path in heav'n, and shone a guide,
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>Then in a steaming stench of sulphur died.
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>"The good old man with suppliant hands implor'd
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>The gods' protection, and their star ador'd.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>'Now, now,' said he, 'my son, no more delay!
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>I yield, I follow where Heav'n shews the way.
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>Keep, O my country gods, our dwelling place,
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>And guard this relic of the Trojan race,
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>This tender child! These omens are your own,
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>And you can yet restore the ruin'd town.
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>At least accomplish what your signs foreshow:
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>I stand resign'd, and am prepar'd to go.'
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>"He said. The crackling flames appear on high.
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>And driving sparkles dance along the sky.
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>With Vulcan's rage the rising winds conspire,
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>And near our palace roll the flood of fire.
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>'Haste, my dear father, ('t is no time to wait,)
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>And load my shoulders with a willing freight.
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>Whate'er befalls, your life shall be my care;
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>One death, or one deliv'rance, we will share.
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>My hand shall lead our little son; and you,
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>My faithful consort, shall our steps pursue.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>Next, you, my servants, heed my strict commands:
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>Without the walls a ruin'd temple stands,
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>To Ceres hallow'd once; a cypress nigh
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>Shoots up her venerable head on high,
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>By long religion kept; there bend your feet,
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>And in divided parties let us meet.
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>Our country gods, the relics, and the bands,
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>Hold you, my father, in your guiltless hands:
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>In me 't is impious holy things to bear,
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>Red as I am with slaughter, new from war,
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>Till in some living stream I cleanse the guilt
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>Of dire debate, and blood in battle spilt.'
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>Thus, ord'ring all that prudence could provide,
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>I clothe my shoulders with a lion's hide
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>And yellow spoils; then, on my bending back,
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>The welcome load of my dear father take;
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>While on my better hand Ascanius hung,
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>And with unequal paces tripp'd along.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>Creusa kept behind; by choice we stray
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>Thro' ev'ry dark and ev'ry devious way.
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>I, who so bold and dauntless, just before,
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>The Grecian darts and shock of lances bore,
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>At ev'ry shadow now am seiz'd with fear,
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>Not for myself, but for the charge I bear;
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>Till, near the ruin'd gate arriv'd at last,
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>Secure, and deeming all the danger past,
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>A frightful noise of trampling feet we hear.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>My father, looking thro' the shades, with fear,
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>Cried out: 'Haste, haste, my son, the foes are nigh;
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>Their swords and shining armor I descry.'
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>Some hostile god, for some unknown offense,
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>Had sure bereft my mind of better sense;
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>For, while thro' winding ways I took my flight,
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>And sought the shelter of the gloomy night,
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>Alas! I lost Creusa: hard to tell
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>If by her fatal destiny she fell,
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>Or weary sate, or wander'd with affright;
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>But she was lost for ever to my sight.
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>I knew not, or reflected, till I meet
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>My friends, at Ceres' now deserted seat.
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>We met: not one was wanting; only she
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>Deceiv'd her friends, her son, and wretched me.
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>"What mad expressions did my tongue refuse!
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>Whom did I not, of gods or men, accuse!
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>This was the fatal blow, that pain'd me more
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>Than all I felt from ruin'd Troy before.
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>Stung with my loss, and raving with despair,
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>Abandoning my now forgotten care,
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>Of counsel, comfort, and of hope bereft,
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>My sire, my son, my country gods I left.
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>In shining armor once again I sheathe
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>My limbs, not feeling wounds, nor fearing death.
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>Then headlong to the burning walls I run,
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>And seek the danger I was forc'd to shun.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>I tread my former tracks; thro' night explore
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>Each passage, ev'ry street I cross'd before.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>All things were full of horror and affright,
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>And dreadful ev'n the silence of the night.
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>Then to my father's house I make repair,
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>With some small glimpse of hope to find her there.
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>Instead of her, the cruel Greeks I met;
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>The house was fill'd with foes, with flames beset.
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>Driv'n on the wings of winds, whole sheets of fire,
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>Thro' air transported, to the roofs aspire.
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>From thence to Priam's palace I resort,
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>And search the citadel and desart court.
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>Then, unobserv'd, I pass by Juno's church:
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>A guard of Grecians had possess'd the porch;
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>There Phoenix and Ulysses watch prey,
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>And thither all the wealth of Troy convey:
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>The spoils which they from ransack'd houses brought,
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>And golden bowls from burning altars caught,
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>The tables of the gods, the purple vests,
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>The people's treasure, and the pomp of priests.
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>A rank of wretched youths, with pinion'd hands,
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>And captive matrons, in long order stands.
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>Then, with ungovern'd madness, I proclaim,
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>Thro' all the silent street, Creusa's name:
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>Creusa still I call; at length she hears,
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>And sudden thro' the shades of night appears-
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>Appears, no more Creusa, nor my wife,
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>But a pale specter, larger than the life.
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>Aghast, astonish'd, and struck dumb with fear,
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>I stood; like bristles rose my stiffen'd hair.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>Then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>'Nor tears, nor cries, can give the dead relief.
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>Desist, my much-lov'd lord,'t indulge your pain;
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>You bear no more than what the gods ordain.
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>My fates permit me not from hence to fly;
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>Nor he, the great controller of the sky.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>Long wand'ring ways for you the pow'rs decree;
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>On land hard labors, and a length of sea.
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>Then, after many painful years are past,
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>On Latium's happy shore you shall be cast,
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>Where gentle Tiber from his bed beholds
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>The flow'ry meadows, and the feeding folds.
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>There end your toils; and there your fates provide
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>A quiet kingdom, and a royal bride:
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>There fortune shall the Trojan line restore,
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>And you for lost Creusa weep no more.
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>Fear not that I shall watch, with servile shame,
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>Th' imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame;
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>Or, stooping to the victor's lust, disgrace
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>My goddess mother, or my royal race.
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>And now, farewell! The parent of the gods
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>Restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes:
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>I trust our common issue to your care.'
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>She said, and gliding pass'd unseen in air.
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>I strove to speak: but horror tied my tongue;
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>And thrice about her neck my arms I flung,
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>And, thrice deceiv'd, on vain embraces hung.
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>Light as an empty dream at break of day,
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>Or as a blast of wind, she rush'd away.
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>"Thus having pass'd the night in fruitless pain,
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>I to my longing friends return again,
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>Amaz'd th' augmented number to behold,
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>Of men and matrons mix'd, of young and old;
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>A wretched exil'd crew together brought,
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>With arms appointed, and with treasure fraught,
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>Resolv'd, and willing, under my command,
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>To run all hazards both of sea and land.
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>The Morn began, from Ida, to display
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>Her rosy cheeks; and Phosphor led the day:
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>Before the gates the Grecians took their post,
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>And all pretense of late relief was lost.
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>I yield to Fate, unwillingly retire,
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>And, loaded, up the hill convey my sire."
