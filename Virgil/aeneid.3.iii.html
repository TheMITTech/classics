<A NAME="10"></A>"When Heav'n had overturn'd the Trojan state
<A NAME="11"></A><BR>And Priam's throne, by too severe a fate;
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>When ruin'd Troy became the Grecians' prey,
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>And Ilium's lofty tow'rs in ashes lay;
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>Warn'd by celestial omens, we retreat,
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>To seek in foreign lands a happier seat.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Near old Antandros, and at Ida's foot,
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>The timber of the sacred groves we cut,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>And build our fleet; uncertain yet to find
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>What place the gods for our repose assign'd.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Friends daily flock; and scarce the kindly spring
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Began to clothe the ground, and birds to sing,
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>When old Anchises summon'd all to sea:
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>The crew my father and the Fates obey.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>With sighs and tears I leave my native shore,
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>And empty fields, where Ilium stood before.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>My sire, my son, our less and greater gods,
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>All sail at once, and cleave the briny floods.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>"Against our coast appears a spacious land,
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Which once the fierce Lycurgus did command,
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>(Thracia the name- the people bold in war;
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Vast are their fields, and tillage is their care,)
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>A hospitable realm while Fate was kind,
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>With Troy in friendship and religion join'd.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>I land; with luckless omens then adore
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>Their gods, and draw a line along the shore;
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>I lay the deep foundations of a wall,
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>And Aenos, nam'd from me, the city call.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>To Dionaean Venus vows are paid,
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>And all the pow'rs that rising labors aid;
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>A bull on Jove's imperial altar laid.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Not far, a rising hillock stood in view;
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Sharp myrtles on the sides, and cornels grew.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>There, while I went to crop the sylvan scenes,
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>And shade our altar with their leafy greens,
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>I pull'd a plant- with horror I relate
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>A prodigy so strange and full of fate.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>The rooted fibers rose, and from the wound
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Black bloody drops distill'd upon the ground.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>Mute and amaz'd, my hair with terror stood;
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>Fear shrunk my sinews, and congeal'd my blood.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Mann'd once again, another plant I try:
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>That other gush'd with the same sanguine dye.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Then, fearing guilt for some offense unknown,
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>With pray'rs and vows the Dryads I atone,
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>With all the sisters of the woods, and most
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>The God of Arms, who rules the Thracian coast,
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>That they, or he, these omens would avert,
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>Release our fears, and better signs impart.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>Clear'd, as I thought, and fully fix'd at length
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>To learn the cause, I tugged with all my strength:
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>I bent my knees against the ground; once more
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>The violated myrtle ran with gore.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Scarce dare I tell the sequel: from the womb
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Of wounded earth, and caverns of the tomb,
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>A groan, as of a troubled ghost, renew'd
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>My fright, and then these dreadful words ensued:
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>'Why dost thou thus my buried body rend?
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>O spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend!
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Spare to pollute thy pious hands with blood:
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>The tears distil not from the wounded wood;
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>But ev'ry drop this living tree contains
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>Is kindred blood, and ran in Trojan veins.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>O fly from this unhospitable shore,
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Warn'd by my fate; for I am Polydore!
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>Here loads of lances, in my blood embrued,
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Again shoot upward, by my blood renew'd.'
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>"My falt'ring tongue and shiv'ring limbs declare
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>My horror, and in bristles rose my hair.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>When Troy with Grecian arms was closely pent,
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Old Priam, fearful of the war's event,
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>This hapless Polydore to Thracia sent:
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>Loaded with gold, he sent his darling, far
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>From noise and tumults, and destructive war,
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Committed to the faithless tyrant's care;
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Who, when he saw the pow'r of Troy decline,
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Forsook the weaker, with the strong to join;
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Broke ev'ry bond of nature and of truth,
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>And murder'd, for his wealth, the royal youth.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>O sacred hunger of pernicious gold!
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>What bands of faith can impious lucre hold?
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Now, when my soul had shaken off her fears,
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>I call my father and the Trojan peers;
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Relate the prodigies of Heav'n, require
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>What he commands, and their advice desire.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>All vote to leave that execrable shore,
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>Polluted with the blood of Polydore;
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>But, ere we sail, his fun'ral rites prepare,
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Then, to his ghost, a tomb and altars rear.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>In mournful pomp the matrons walk the round,
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>With baleful cypress and blue fillets crown'd,
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>With eyes dejected, and with hair unbound.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>Then bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour,
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>And thrice invoke the soul of Polydore.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>"Now, when the raging storms no longer reign,
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>But southern gales invite us to the main,
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>We launch our vessels, with a prosp'rous wind,
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>And leave the cities and the shores behind.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>"An island in th' Aegaean main appears;
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Neptune and wat'ry Doris claim it theirs.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>It floated once, till Phoebus fix'd the sides
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>To rooted earth, and now it braves the tides.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Here, borne by friendly winds, we come ashore,
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>With needful ease our weary limbs restore,
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>And the Sun's temple and his town adore.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>"Anius, the priest and king, with laurel crown'd,
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>His hoary locks with purple fillets bound,
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>Who saw my sire the Delian shore ascend,
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Came forth with eager haste to meet his friend;
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Invites him to his palace; and, in sign
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Of ancient love, their plighted hands they join.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Then to the temple of the god I went,
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>And thus, before the shrine, my vows present:
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>'Give, O Thymbraeus, give a resting place
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>To the sad relics of the Trojan race;
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>A seat secure, a region of their own,
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>A lasting empire, and a happier town.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>Where shall we fix? where shall our labors end?
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Whom shall we follow, and what fate attend?
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Let not my pray'rs a doubtful answer find;
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>But in clear auguries unveil thy mind.'
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Scarce had I said: he shook the holy ground,
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>The laurels, and the lofty hills around;
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>And from the tripos rush'd a bellowing sound.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Prostrate we fell; confess'd the present god,
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>Who gave this answer from his dark abode:
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>'Undaunted youths, go, seek that mother earth
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>From which your ancestors derive their birth.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>The soil that sent you forth, her ancient race
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>In her old bosom shall again embrace.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>Thro' the wide world th' Aeneian house shall reign,
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>And children's children shall the crown sustain.'
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Thus Phoebus did our future fates disclose:
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>A mighty tumult, mix'd with joy, arose.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>"All are concern'd to know what place the god
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>Assign'd, and where determin'd our abode.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>My father, long revolving in his mind
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>The race and lineage of the Trojan kind,
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Thus answer'd their demands: 'Ye princes, hear
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Your pleasing fortune, and dispel your fear.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>The fruitful isle of Crete, well known to fame,
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Sacred of old to Jove's imperial name,
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>In the mid ocean lies, with large command,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>And on its plains a hundred cities stand.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>Another Ida rises there, and we
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>From thence derive our Trojan ancestry.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>From thence, as 't is divulg'd by certain fame,
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>To the Rhoetean shores old Teucrus came;
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>There fix'd, and there the seat of empire chose,
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>Ere Ilium and the Trojan tow'rs arose.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>In humble vales they built their soft abodes,
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Till Cybele, the mother of the gods,
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>With tinkling cymbals charm'd th' Idaean woods,
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>She secret rites and ceremonies taught,
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>And to the yoke the savage lions brought.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Let us the land which Heav'n appoints, explore;
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Appease the winds, and seek the Gnossian shore.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>If Jove assists the passage of our fleet,
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>The third propitious dawn discovers Crete.'
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Thus having said, the sacrifices, laid
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>On smoking altars, to the gods he paid:
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>A bull, to Neptune an oblation due,
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Another bull to bright Apollo slew;
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>A milk-white ewe, the western winds to please,
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>And one coal-black, to calm the stormy seas.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Ere this, a flying rumor had been spread
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>That fierce Idomeneus from Crete was fled,
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>Expell'd and exil'd; that the coast was free
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>From foreign or domestic enemy.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>"We leave the Delian ports, and put to sea;
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>By Naxos, fam'd for vintage, make our way;
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>Then green Donysa pass; and sail in sight
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Of Paros' isle, with marble quarries white.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>We pass the scatter'd isles of Cyclades,
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>That, scarce distinguish'd, seem to stud the seas.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>The shouts of sailors double near the shores;
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>They stretch their canvas, and they ply their oars.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>'All hands aloft! for Crete! for Crete!' they cry,
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>And swiftly thro' the foamy billows fly.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Full on the promis'd land at length we bore,
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>With joy descending on the Cretan shore.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>With eager haste a rising town I frame,
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Which from the Trojan Pergamus I name:
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>The name itself was grateful; I exhort
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>To found their houses, and erect a fort.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Our ships are haul'd upon the yellow strand;
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>The youth begin to till the labor'd land;
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>And I myself new marriages promote,
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>Give laws, and dwellings I divide by lot;
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>When rising vapors choke the wholesome air,
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>And blasts of noisome winds corrupt the year;
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>The trees devouring caterpillars burn;
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Parch'd was the grass, and blighted was the corn:
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>Nor 'scape the beasts; for Sirius, from on high,
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>With pestilential heat infects the sky:
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>My men- some fall, the rest in fevers fry.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Again my father bids me seek the shore
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Of sacred Delos, and the god implore,
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>To learn what end of woes we might expect,
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>And to what clime our weary course direct.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>"'T was night, when ev'ry creature, void of cares,
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>The common gift of balmy slumber shares:
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>The statues of my gods (for such they seem'd),
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Those gods whom I from flaming Troy redeem'd,
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>Before me stood, majestically bright,
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Full in the beams of Phoebe's ent'ring light.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Then thus they spoke, and eas'd my troubled mind:
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>'What from the Delian god thou go'st to find,
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>He tells thee here, and sends us to relate.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Those pow'rs are we, companions of thy fate,
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>Who from the burning town by thee were brought,
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Thy fortune follow'd, and thy safety wrought.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Thro' seas and lands as we thy steps attend,
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>So shall our care thy glorious race befriend.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>An ample realm for thee thy fates ordain,
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>A town that o'er the conquer'd world shall reign.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Thou, mighty walls for mighty nations build;
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Nor let thy weary mind to labors yield:
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>But change thy seat; for not the Delian god,
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>Nor we, have giv'n thee Crete for our abode.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>A land there is, Hesperia call'd of old,
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>(The soil is fruitful, and the natives bold-
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>Th' Oenotrians held it once,) by later fame
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Now call'd Italia, from the leader's name.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>lasius there and Dardanus were born;
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>From thence we came, and thither must return.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Rise, and thy sire with these glad tidings greet.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Search Italy; for Jove denies thee Crete.'
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>"Astonish'd at their voices and their sight,
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>(Nor were they dreams, but visions of the night;
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>I saw, I knew their faces, and descried,
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>In perfect view, their hair with fillets tied;)
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>I started from my couch; a clammy sweat
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>On all my limbs and shiv'ring body sate.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>To heav'n I lift my hands with pious haste,
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>And sacred incense in the flames I cast.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Thus to the gods their perfect honors done,
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>More cheerful, to my good old sire I run,
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>And tell the pleasing news. In little space
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>He found his error of the double race;
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Not, as before he deem'd, deriv'd from Crete;
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>No more deluded by the doubtful seat:
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Then said: 'O son, turmoil'd in Trojan fate!
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Such things as these Cassandra did relate.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>This day revives within my mind what she
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Foretold of Troy renew'd in Italy,
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>And Latian lands; but who could then have thought
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>That Phrygian gods to Latium should be brought,
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>Or who believ'd what mad Cassandra taught?
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>Now let us go where Phoebus leads the way.'
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>"He said; and we with glad consent obey,
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>Forsake the seat, and, leaving few behind,
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>We spread our sails before the willing wind.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>Now from the sight of land our galleys move,
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>With only seas around and skies above;
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>When o'er our heads descends a burst of rain,
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>And night with sable clouds involves the main;
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>The ruffling winds the foamy billows raise;
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>The scatter'd fleet is forc'd to sev'ral ways;
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>The face of heav'n is ravish'd from our eyes,
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>And in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Cast from our course, we wander in the dark.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>No stars to guide, no point of land to mark.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Ev'n Palinurus no distinction found
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Betwixt the night and day; such darkness reign'd 
<A NAME="275"></A>around.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>Three starless nights the doubtful navy strays,
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Without distinction, and three sunless days;
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>The fourth renews the light, and, from our shrouds,
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>We view a rising land, like distant clouds;
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>The mountain-tops confirm the pleasing sight,
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>And curling smoke ascending from their height.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>The canvas falls; their oars the sailors ply;
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>From the rude strokes the whirling waters fly.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>At length I land upon the Strophades,
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Safe from the danger of the stormy seas.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Those isles are compass'd by th' Ionian main,
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>The dire abode where the foul Harpies reign,
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>Forc'd by the winged warriors to repair
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>To their old homes, and leave their costly fare.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Monsters more fierce offended Heav'n ne'er sent
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>From hell's abyss, for human punishment:
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>With virgin faces, but with wombs obscene,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>Foul paunches, and with ordure still unclean;
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>With claws for hands, and looks for ever lean.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>"We landed at the port, and soon beheld
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Fat herds of oxen graze the flow'ry field,
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>And wanton goats without a keeper stray'd.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>With weapons we the welcome prey invade,
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>Then call the gods for partners of our feast,
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>And Jove himself, the chief invited guest.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>We spread the tables on the greensward ground;
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>We feed with hunger, and the bowls go round;
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>When from the mountain-tops, with hideous cry,
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>And clatt'ring wings, the hungry Harpies fly;
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>They snatch the meat, defiling all they find,
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>And, parting, leave a loathsome stench behind.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Close by a hollow rock, again we sit,
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>New dress the dinner, and the beds refit,
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>Secure from sight, beneath a pleasing shade,
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Where tufted trees a native arbor made.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>Again the holy fires on altars burn;
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>And once again the rav'nous birds return,
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>Or from the dark recesses where they lie,
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>Or from another quarter of the sky;
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>With filthy claws their odious meal repeat,
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>And mix their loathsome ordures with their meat.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>I bid my friends for vengeance then prepare,
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>And with the hellish nation wage the war.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>They, as commanded, for the fight provide,
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>And in the grass their glitt'ring weapons hide;
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>Then, when along the crooked shore we hear
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>Their clatt'ring wings, and saw the foes appear,
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Misenus sounds a charge: we take th' alarm,
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>And our strong hands with swords and bucklers arm.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>In this new kind of combat all employ
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>Their utmost force, the monsters to destroy.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>In vain- the fated skin is proof to wounds;
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>And from their plumes the shining sword rebounds.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>At length rebuff'd, they leave their mangled prey,
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>And their stretch'd pinions to the skies display.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Yet one remain'd- the messenger of Fate:
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>High on a craggy cliff Celaeno sate,
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>And thus her dismal errand did relate:
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>'What! not contented with our oxen slain,
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Dare you with Heav'n an impious war maintain,
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>And drive the Harpies from their native reign?
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Heed therefore what I say; and keep in mind
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>What Jove decrees, what Phoebus has design'd,
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>And I, the Furies' queen, from both relate-
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>You seek th' Italian shores, foredoom'd by fate:
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Th' Italian shores are granted you to find,
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>And a safe passage to the port assign'd.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>But know, that ere your promis'd walls you build,
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>My curses shall severely be fulfill'd.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>Fierce famine is your lot for this misdeed,
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>Reduc'd to grind the plates on which you feed.'
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>She said, and to the neighb'ring forest flew.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>Our courage fails us, and our fears renew.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Hopeless to win by war, to pray'rs we fall,
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>And on th' offended Harpies humbly call,
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>And whether gods or birds obscene they were,
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>Our vows for pardon and for peace prefer.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>But old Anchises, off'ring sacrifice,
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>And lifting up to heav'n his hands and eyes,
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Ador'd the greater gods: 'Avert,' said he,
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>'These omens; render vain this prophecy,
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>And from th' impending curse a pious people free!'
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>"Thus having said, he bids us put to sea;
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>We loose from shore our haulsers, and obey,
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>And soon with swelling sails pursue the wat'ry way.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>Amidst our course, Zacynthian woods appear;
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>And next by rocky Neritos we steer:
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>We fly from Ithaca's detested shore,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>And curse the land which dire Ulysses bore.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>At length Leucate's cloudy top appears,
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>And the Sun's temple, which the sailor fears.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>Resolv'd to breathe a while from labor past,
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Our crooked anchors from the prow we cast,
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>And joyful to the little city haste.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Here, safe beyond our hopes, our vows we pay
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>To Jove, the guide and patron of our way.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>The customs of our country we pursue,
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>And Trojan games on Actian shores renew.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Our youth their naked limbs besmear with oil,
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>And exercise the wrastlers' noble toil;
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Pleas'd to have sail'd so long before the wind,
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>And left so many Grecian towns behind.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>The sun had now fulfill'd his annual course,
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>And Boreas on the seas display'd his force:
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>I fix'd upon the temple's lofty door
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>The brazen shield which vanquish'd Abas bore;
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>The verse beneath my name and action speaks:
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>'These arms Aeneas took from conqu'ring Greeks.'
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>Then I command to weigh; the seamen ply
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Their sweeping oars; the smoking billows fly.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>The sight of high Phaeacia soon we lost,
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>And skimm'd along Epirus' rocky coast.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>"Then to Chaonia's port our course we bend,
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>And, landed, to Buthrotus' heights ascend.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>Here wondrous things were loudly blaz'd fame:
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>How Helenus reviv'd the Trojan name,
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>And reign'd in Greece; that Priam's captive son
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Succeeded Pyrrhus in his bed and throne;
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>And fair Andromache, restor'd by fate,
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Once more was happy in a Trojan mate.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>I leave my galleys riding in the port,
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>And long to see the new Dardanian court.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>By chance, the mournful queen, before the gate,
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Then solemniz'd her former husband's fate.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Green altars, rais'd of turf, with gifts she crown'd,
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>And sacred priests in order stand around,
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>And thrice the name of hapless Hector sound.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>The grove itself resembles Ida's wood;
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>And Simois seem'd the well-dissembled flood.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>But when at nearer distance she beheld
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>My shining armor and my Trojan shield,
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Astonish'd at the sight, the vital heat
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Forsakes her limbs; her veins no longer beat:
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>She faints, she falls, and scarce recov'ring strength,
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Thus, with a falt'ring tongue, she speaks at length:
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>"'Are you alive, O goddess-born ?' she said,
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>'Or if a ghost, then where is Hector's shade?'
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>At this, she cast a loud and frightful cry.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>With broken words I made this brief reply:
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>'All of me that remains appears in sight;
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>I live, if living be to loathe the light.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>No phantom; but I drag a wretched life,
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>My fate resembling that of Hector's wife.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>What have you suffer'd since you lost your lord?
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>By what strange blessing are you now restor'd?
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Still are you Hector's? or is Hector fled,
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>And his remembrance lost in Pyrrhus' bed?'
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>With eyes dejected, in a lowly tone,
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>After a modest pause she thus begun:
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>"'O only happy maid of Priam's race,
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Whom death deliver'd from the foes' embrace!
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Commanded on Achilles' tomb to die,
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>Not forc'd, like us, to hard captivity,
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Or in a haughty master's arms to lie.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>In Grecian ships unhappy we were borne,
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Endur'd the victor's lust, sustain'd the scorn:
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>Thus I submitted to the lawless pride
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>Of Pyrrhus, more a handmaid than a bride.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>Cloy'd with possession, he forsook my bed,
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>And Helen's lovely daughter sought to wed;
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Then me to Trojan Helenus resign'd,
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>And his two slaves in equal marriage join'd;
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Till young Orestes, pierc'd with deep despair,
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>And longing to redeem the promis'd fair,
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Before Apollo's altar slew the ravisher.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>By Pyrrhus' death the kingdom we regain'd:
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>At least one half with Helenus remain'd.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Our part, from Chaon, he Chaonia calls,
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>And names from Pergamus his rising walls.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>But you, what fates have landed on our coast?
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>What gods have sent you, or what storms have toss'd?
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Does young Ascanius life and health enjoy,
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Sav'd from the ruins of unhappy Troy?
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>O tell me how his mother's loss he bears,
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>What hopes are promis'd from his blooming years,
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>How much of Hector in his face appears?'
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>She spoke; and mix'd her speech with mournful cries,
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>And fruitless tears came trickling from her eyes.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>"At length her lord descends upon the plain,
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>In pomp, attended with a num'rous train;
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>Receives his friends, and to the city leads,
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>And tears of joy amidst his welcome sheds.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Proceeding on, another Troy I see,
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Or, in less compass, Troy's epitome.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>A riv'let by the name of Xanthus ran,
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>And I embrace the Scaean gate again.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>My friends in porticoes were entertain'd,
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>And feasts and pleasures thro' the city reign'd.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>The tables fill'd the spacious hall around,
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>And golden bowls with sparkling wine were crown'd.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>Two days we pass'd in mirth, till friendly gales,
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Blown from the supplied our swelling sails.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>Then to the royal seer I thus began:
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>'O thou, who know'st, beyond the reach of man,
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>The laws of heav'n, and what the stars decree;
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Whom Phoebus taught unerring prophecy,
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>From his own tripod, and his holy tree;
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Skill'd in the wing'd inhabitants of air,
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>What auspices their notes and flights declare:
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>O say- for all religious rites portend
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>A happy voyage, and a prosp'rous end;
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>And ev'ry power and omen of the sky
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>Direct my course for destin'd Italy;
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>But only dire Celaeno, from the gods,
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>A dismal famine fatally forebodes-
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>O say what dangers I am first to shun,
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>What toils vanquish, and what course to run.'
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>"The prophet first with sacrifice adores
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>The greater gods; their pardon then implores;
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>Unbinds the fillet from his holy head;
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>To Phoebus, next, my trembling steps he led,
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Full of religious doubts and awful dread.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>Then, with his god possess'd, before the shrine,
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>These words proceeded from his mouth divine:
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>'O goddess-born, (for Heav'n's appointed will,
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>With greater auspices of good than ill,
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>Foreshows thy voyage, and thy course directs;
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Thy fates conspire, and Jove himself protects,)
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Of many things some few I shall explain,
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>Teach thee to shun the dangers of the main,
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>And how at length the promis'd shore to gain.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>The rest the fates from Helenus conceal,
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>And Juno's angry pow'r forbids to tell.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>First, then, that happy shore, that seems so nigh,
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Will far from your deluded wishes fly;
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>Long tracts of seas divide your hopes from Italy:
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>For you must cruise along Sicilian shores,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>And stem the currents with your struggling oars;
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>Then round th' Italian coast your navy steer;
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>And, after this, to Circe's island veer;
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>And, last, before your new foundations rise,
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Must pass the Stygian lake, and view the nether 
<A NAME="508"></A>skies.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Now mark the signs of future ease and rest,
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>And bear them safely treasur'd in thy breast.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>When, in the shady shelter of a wood,
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>And near the margin of a gentle flood,
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Thou shalt behold a sow upon the ground,
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>With thirty sucking young encompass'd round;
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>The dam and offspring white as falling snow-
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>These on thy city shall their name bestow,
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>And there shall end thy labors and thy woe.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Nor let the threaten'd famine fright thy mind,
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>For Phoebus will assist, and Fate the way will find.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Let not thy course to that ill coast be bent,
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>Which fronts from far th' Epirian continent:
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>Those parts are all by Grecian foes possess'd;
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>The salvage Locrians here the shores infest;
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>There fierce Idomeneus his city builds,
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>And guards with arms the Salentinian fields;
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>And on the mountain's brow Petilia stands,
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Which Philoctetes with his troops commands.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>Ev'n when thy fleet is landed on the shore,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>And priests with holy vows the gods adore,
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Then with a purple veil involve your eyes,
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>Lest hostile faces blast the sacrifice.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>These rites and customs to the rest commend,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>That to your pious race they may descend.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR><B>"'When, parted hence, the wind, that ready 
<A NAME="535"></A>waits</B>
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>For Sicily, shall bear you to the straits
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>Where proud Pelorus opes a wider way,
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Tack to the larboard, and stand off to sea:
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Veer starboard sea and land. Th' Italian shore
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>And fair Sicilia's coast were one, before
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>An earthquake caus'd the flaw: the roaring tides
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>The passage broke that land from land divides;
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>And where the lands retir'd, the rushing ocean rides.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>Distinguish'd by the straits, on either hand,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Now rising cities in long order stand,
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>And fruitful fields: so much can time invade
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>The mold'ring work that beauteous Nature made.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Far on the right, her dogs foul Scylla hides:
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Charybdis roaring on the left presides,
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>And in her greedy whirlpool sucks the tides;
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Then spouts them from below: with fury driv'n,
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>The waves mount up and wash the face of heav'n.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>But Scylla from her den, with open jaws,
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>The sinking vessel in her eddy draws,
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>Then dashes on the rocks. A human face,
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>And virgin bosom, hides her tail's disgrace:
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Her parts obscene below the waves descend,
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>With dogs inclos'd, and in a dolphin end.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>'T is safer, then, to bear aloof to sea,
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>And coast Pachynus, tho' with more delay,
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Than once to view misshapen Scylla near,
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>And the loud yell of wat'ry wolves to hear.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>"'Besides, if faith to Helenus be due,
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>And if prophetic Phoebus tell me true,
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>Do not this precept of your friend forget,
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>Which therefore more than once I must repeat:
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Above the rest, great Juno's name adore;
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>Pay vows to Juno; Juno's aid implore.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>Let gifts be to the mighty queen design'd,
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>And mollify with pray'rs her haughty mind.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Thus, at the length, your passage shall be free,
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>And you shall safe descend on Italy.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Arriv'd at Cumae, when you view the flood
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Of black Avernus, and the sounding wood,
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>The mad prophetic Sibyl you shall find,
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Dark in a cave, and on a rock reclin'd.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>She sings the fates, and, in her frantic fits,
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>The notes and names, inscrib'd, to leafs commits.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>What she commits to leafs, in order laid,
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>Before the cavern's entrance are display'd:
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Unmov'd they lie; but, if a blast of wind
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Without, or vapors issue from behind,
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>The leafs are borne aloft in liquid air,
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>And she resumes no more her museful care,
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>Nor gathers from the rocks her scatter'd verse,
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Nor sets in order what the winds disperse.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Thus, many not succeeding, most upbraid
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>The madness of the visionary maid,
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>And with loud curses leave the mystic shade.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>"'Think it not loss of time a while to stay,
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>Tho' thy companions chide thy long delay;
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Tho' summon'd to the seas, tho' pleasing gales
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Invite thy course, and stretch thy swelling sails:
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>But beg the sacred priestess to relate
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>With willing words, and not to write thy fate.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>The fierce Italian people she will show,
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>And all thy wars, and all thy future woe,
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>And what thou may'st avoid, and what must undergo.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>She shall direct thy course, instruct thy mind,
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>And teach thee how the happy shores to find.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>This is what Heav'n allows me to relate:
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Now part in peace; pursue thy better fate,
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>And raise, by strength of arms, the Trojan state.'
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>"This when the priest with friendly voice declar'd,
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>He gave me license, and rich gifts prepar'd:
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Bounteous of treasure, he supplied my want
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>With heavy gold, and polish'd elephant;
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>Then Dodonaean caldrons put on board,
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>And ev'ry ship with sums of silver stor'd.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>A trusty coat of mail to me he sent,
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Thrice chain'd with gold, for use and ornament;
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>The helm of Pyrrhus added to the rest,
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>That flourish'd with a plume and waving crest.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>Nor was my sire forgotten, nor my friends;
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>And large recruits he to my navy sends:
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>Men, horses, captains, arms, and warlike stores;
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Supplies new pilots, and new sweeping oars.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Meantime, my sire commands to hoist our sails,
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>Lest we should lose the first auspicious gales.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>"The prophet bless'd the parting crew, and last,
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>With words like these, his ancient friend embrac'd:
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>'Old happy man, the care of gods above,
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>Whom heav'nly Venus honor'd with her love,
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>And twice preserv'd thy life, when Troy was lost,
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>Behold from far the wish'd Ausonian coast:
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>There land; but take a larger compass round,
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>For that before is all forbidden ground.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>The shore that Phoebus has design'd for you,
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>At farther distance lies, conceal'd from view.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>Go happy hence, and seek your new abodes,
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Blest in a son, and favor'd by the gods:
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>For I with useless words prolong your stay,
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>When southern gales have summon'd you away.'
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>"Nor less the queen our parting thence deplor'd,
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>Nor was less bounteous than her Trojan lord.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>A noble present to my son she brought,
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>A robe with flow'rs on golden tissue wrought,
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>A phrygian vest; and loads with gifts beside
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Of precious texture, and of Asian pride.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>'Accept,' she said, 'these monuments of love,
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Which in my youth with happier hands I wove:
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>Regard these trifles for the giver's sake;
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>'T is the last present Hector's wife can make.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Thou call'st my lost Astyanax to mind;
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>In thee his features and his form I find:
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>His eyes so sparkled with a lively flame;
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Such were his motions; such was all his frame;
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>And ah! had Heav'n so pleas'd, his years had been the 
<A NAME="649"></A>same.'
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>"With tears I took my last adieu, and said:
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>'Your fortune, happy pair, already made,
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Leaves you no farther wish. My diff'rent state,
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Avoiding one, incurs another fate.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>To you a quiet seat the gods allow:
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>You have no shores to search, no seas to plow,
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Nor fields of flying Italy to chase:
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>(Deluding visions, and a vain embrace!)
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>You see another Simois, and enjoy
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>The labor of your hands, another Troy,
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>With better auspice than her ancient tow'rs,
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>And less obnoxious to the Grecian pow'rs.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>If e'er the gods, whom I with vows adore,
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>Conduct my steps to Tiber's happy shore;
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>If ever I ascend the Latian throne,
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>And build a city I may call my own;
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>As both of us our birth from Troy derive,
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>So let our kindred lines in concord live,
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>And both in acts of equal friendship strive.
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>Our fortunes, good or bad, shall be the same:
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>The double Troy shall differ but in name;
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>That what we now begin may never end,
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>But long to late posterity descend.'
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>"Near the Ceraunian rocks our course we bore;
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>The shortest passage to th' Italian shore.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Now had the sun withdrawn his radiant light,
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>And hills were hid in dusky shades of night:
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>We land, and, on the bosom Of the ground,
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>A safe retreat and a bare lodging found.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Close by the shore we lay; the sailors keep
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Their watches, and the rest securely sleep.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>The night, proceeding on with silent pace,
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>Stood in her noon, and view'd with equal face
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>Her steepy rise and her declining race.
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Then wakeful Palinurus rose, to spy
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>The face of heav'n, and the nocturnal sky;
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>And listen'd ev'ry breath of air to try;
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>Observes the stars, and notes their sliding course,
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>The Pleiads, Hyads, and their wat'ry force;
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>And both the Bears is careful to behold,
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>And bright Orion, arm'd with burnish'd gold.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Then, when he saw no threat'ning tempest nigh,
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>But a sure promise of a settled sky,
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>He gave the sign to weigh; we break our sleep,
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Forsake the pleasing shore, and plow the deep.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>"And now the rising morn with rosy light
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>Adorns the skies, and puts the stars to flight;
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>When we from far, like bluish mists, descry
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>The hills, and then the plains, of Italy.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>Achates first pronounc'd the joyful sound;
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>Then, 'Italy!' the cheerful crew rebound.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>My sire Anchises crown'd a cup with wine,
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>And, off'ring, thus implor'd the pow'rs divine:
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>'Ye gods, presiding over lands and seas,
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>And you who raging winds and waves appease,
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Breathe on our swelling sails a prosp'rous wind,
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>And smooth our passage to the port assign'd!'
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>The gentle gales their flagging force renew,
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>And now the happy harbor is in view.
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>Minerva's temple then salutes our sight,
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>Plac'd, as a landmark, on the mountain's height.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>We furl our sails, and turn the prows to shore;
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>The curling waters round the galleys roar.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>The land lies open to the raging east,
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Then, bending like a bow, with rocks compress'd,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>Shuts out the storms; the winds and waves complain,
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>And vent their malice on the cliffs in vain.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>The port lies hid within; on either side
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Two tow'ring rocks the narrow mouth divide.
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>The temple, which aloft we view'd before,
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>To distance flies, and seems to shun the shore.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>Scarce landed, the first omens I beheld
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Were four white steeds that cropp'd the flow'ry 
<A NAME="723"></A>field.
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>'War, war is threaten'd from this foreign ground,'
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>My father cried, 'where warlike steeds are found.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Yet, since reclaim'd to chariots they submit,
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>And bend to stubborn yokes, and champ the bit,
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>Peace may succeed to war.' Our way we bend
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>To Pallas, and the sacred hill ascend;
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>There prostrate to the fierce virago pray,
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Whose temple was the landmark of our way.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Each with a Phrygian mantle veil'd his head,
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>And all commands of Helenus obey'd,
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>And pious rites to Grecian Juno paid.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>These dues perform'd, we stretch our sails, and 
<A NAME="736"></A>stand
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>To sea, forsaking that suspected land.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>"From hence Tarentum's bay appears in view,
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>For Hercules renown'd, if fame be true.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>Just opposite, Lacinian Juno stands;
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>Caulonian tow'rs, and Scylacaean strands,
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>For shipwrecks fear'd. Mount Aetna thence we spy,
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>Known by the smoky flames which cloud the sky.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>Far off we hear the waves with surly sound
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>Invade the rocks, the rocks their groans rebound.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>The billows break upon the sounding strand,
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>And roll the rising tide, impure with sand.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Then thus Anchises, in experience old:
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>''T is that Charybdis which the seer foretold,
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>And those the promis'd rocks! Bear off to sea!'
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>With haste the frighted mariners obey.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>First Palinurus to the larboard veer'd;
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>Then all the fleet by his example steer'd.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>To heav'n aloft on ridgy waves we ride,
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>Then down to hell descend, when they divide;
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>And thrice our galleys knock'd the stony ground,
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>And thrice the hollow rocks return'd the sound,
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>And thrice we saw the stars, that stood with dews 
<A NAME="759"></A>around.
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>The flagging winds forsook us, with the sun;
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>And, wearied, on Cyclopian shores we run.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>The port capacious, and secure from wind,
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>Is to the foot of thund'ring Aetna join'd.
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>By turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high;
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>By turns hot embers from her entrails fly,
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>And flakes of mounting flames, that lick the sky.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>Oft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown,
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>And, shiver'd by the force, come piecemeal down.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Oft liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow,
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>Fed from the fiery springs that boil below.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>Enceladus, they say, transfix'd by Jove,
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>With blasted limbs came tumbling from above;
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>And, where he fell, th' avenging father drew
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>This flaming hill, and on his body threw.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>As often as he turns his weary sides,
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>He shakes the solid isle, and smoke the heavens 
<A NAME="777"></A>hides.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>In shady woods we pass the tedious night,
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>Where bellowing sounds and groans our souls affright,
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>Of which no cause is offer'd to the sight;
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>For not one star was kindled in the sky,
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>Nor could the moon her borrow'd light supply;
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>For misty clouds involv'd the firmament,
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>The stars were muffled, and the moon was pent.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>"Scarce had the rising sun the day reveal'd,
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>Scarce had his heat the pearly dews dispell'd,
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>When from the woods there bolts, before our sight,
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>Somewhat betwixt a mortal and a sprite,
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>So thin, so ghastly meager, and so wan,
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>So bare of flesh, he scarce resembled man.
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>This thing, all tatter'd, seem'd from far t' implore
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>Our pious aid, and pointed to the shore.
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>We look behind, then view his shaggy beard;
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>His clothes were tagg'd with thorns, and filth his limbs 
<A NAME="795"></A>besmear'd;
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>The rest, in mien, in habit, and in face,
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>Appear'd a Greek, and such indeed he was.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>He cast on us, from far, a frightful view,
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>Whom soon for Trojans and for foes he knew;
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>Stood still, and paus'd; then all at once began
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>To stretch his limbs, and trembled as he ran.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Soon as approach'd, upon his knees he falls,
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>And thus with tears and sighs for pity calls:
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>'Now, by the pow'rs above, and what we share
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>From Nature's common gift, this vital air,
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>O Trojans, take me hence! I beg no more;
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>But bear me far from this unhappy shore.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>'T is true, I am a Greek, and farther own,
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>Among your foes besieg'd th' imperial town.
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>For such demerits if my death be due,
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>No more for this abandon'd life I sue;
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>This only favor let my tears obtain,
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>To throw me headlong in the rapid main:
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Since nothing more than death my crime demands,
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>I die content, to die by human hands.'
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>He said, and on his knees my knees embrac'd:
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>I bade him boldly tell his fortune past,
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>His present state, his lineage, and his name,
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>Th' occasion of his fears, and whence he came.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>The good Anchises rais'd him with his hand;
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>Who, thus encourag'd, answer'd our demand:
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>'From Ithaca, my native soil, I came
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>To Troy; and Achaemenides my name.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Me my poor father with Ulysses sent;
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>(O had I stay'd, with poverty content!)
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>But, fearful for themselves, my countrymen
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>Left me forsaken in the Cyclops' den.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>The cave, tho' large, was dark; the dismal floor
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>Was pav'd with mangled limbs and putrid gore.
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>Our monstrous host, of more than human size,
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>Erects his head, and stares within the skies;
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>Bellowing his voice, and horrid is his hue.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>Ye gods, remove this plague from mortal view!
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>The joints of slaughter'd wretches are his food;
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>And for his wine he quaffs the streaming blood.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>These eyes beheld, when with his spacious hand
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>He seiz'd two captives of our Grecian band;
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>Stretch'd on his back, he dash'd against the stones
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>Their broken bodies, and their crackling bones:
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>With spouting blood the purple pavement swims,
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>While the dire glutton grinds the trembling limbs.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>"'Not unreveng'd Ulysses bore their fate,
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>Nor thoughtless of his own unhappy state;
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>For, gorg'd with flesh, and drunk with human wine
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>While fast asleep the giant lay supine,
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>Snoring aloud, and belching from his maw
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>His indigested foam, and morsels raw;
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>We pray; we cast the lots, and then surround
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>The monstrous body, stretch'd along the ground:
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>Each, as he could approach him, lends a hand
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>To bore his eyeball with a flaming brand.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>Beneath his frowning forehead lay his eye;
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>For only one did the vast frame supply-
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>But that a globe so large, his front it fill'd,
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>Like the sun's disk or like a Grecian shield.
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>The stroke succeeds; and down the pupil bends:
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>This vengeance follow'd for our slaughter'd friends.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>But haste, unhappy wretches, haste to fly!
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>Your cables cut, and on your oars rely!
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>Such, and so vast as Polypheme appears,
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>A hundred more this hated island bears:
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>Like him, in caves they shut their woolly sheep;
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>Like him, their herds on tops of mountains keep;
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>Like him, with mighty strides, they stalk from steep to 
<A NAME="865"></A>steep
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>And now three moons their sharpen'd horns renew,
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>Since thus, in woods and wilds, obscure from view,
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>I drag my loathsome days with mortal fright,
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>And in deserted caverns lodge by night;
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>Oft from the rocks a dreadful prospect see
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>Of the huge Cyclops, like a walking tree:
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>From far I hear his thund'ring voice resound,
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>And trampling feet that shake the solid ground.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>Cornels and salvage berries of the wood,
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>And roots and herbs, have been my meager food.
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>While all around my longing eyes I cast,
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>I saw your happy ships appear at last.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>On those I fix'd my hopes, to these I run;
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>'T is all I ask, this cruel race to shun;
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>What other death you please, yourselves bestow.'
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>"Scarce had he said, when on the mountain's brow
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>We saw the giant shepherd stalk before
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>His following flock, and leading to the shore:
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>A monstrous bulk, deform'd, depriv'd of sight;
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>His staff a trunk of pine, to guide his steps aright.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>His pond'rous whistle from his neck descends;
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>His woolly care their pensive lord attends:
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>This only solace his hard fortune sends.
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>Soon as he reach'd the shore and touch'd the waves,
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>From his bor'd eye the gutt'ring blood he laves:
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>He gnash'd his teeth, and groan'd; thro' seas he 
<A NAME="892"></A>strides,
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>And scarce the topmost billows touch'd his sides.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>"Seiz'd with a sudden fear, we run to sea,
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>The cables cut, and silent haste away;
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>The well-deserving stranger entertain;
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>Then, buckling to the work, our oars divide the 
<A NAME="898"></A>main.
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>The giant harken'd to the dashing sound:
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>But, when our vessels out of reach he found,
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>He strided onward, and in vain essay'd
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>Th' Ionian deep, and durst no farther wade.
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>With that he roar'd aloud: the dreadful cry
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>Shakes earth, and air, and seas; the billows fly
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>Before the bellowing noise to distant Italy.
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>The neigh'ring Aetna trembling all around,
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>The winding caverns echo to the sound.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>His brother Cyclops hear the yelling roar,
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>And, rushing down the mountains, crowd the shore.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>We saw their stern distorted looks, from far,
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>And one-eyed glance, that vainly threaten'd war:
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>A dreadful council, with their heads on high;
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>(The misty clouds about their foreheads fly;)
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>Not yielding to the tow'ring tree of Jove,
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>Or tallest cypress of Diana's grove.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>New pangs of mortal fear our minds assail;
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>We tug at ev'ry oar, and hoist up ev'ry sail,
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>And take th' advantage of the friendly gale.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>Forewarn'd by Helenus, we strive to shun
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>Charybdis' gulf, nor dare to Scylla run.
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>An equal fate on either side appears:
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>We, tacking to the left, are free from fears;
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>For, from Pelorus' point, the North arose,
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>And drove us back where swift Pantagias flows.
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>His rocky mouth we pass, and make our way
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>By Thapsus and Megara's winding bay.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>This passage Achaemenides had shown,
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>Tracing the course which he before had run.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>"Right o'er against Plemmyrium's wat'ry strand,
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>There lies an isle once call'd th' Ortygian land.
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>Alpheus, as old fame reports, has found
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>From Greece a secret passage under ground,
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>By love to beauteous Arethusa led;
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>And, mingling here, they roll in the same sacred 
<A NAME="935"></A>bed.
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>As Helenus enjoin'd, we next adore
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>Diana's name, protectress of the shore.
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>With prosp'rous gales we pass the quiet sounds
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>Of still Elorus, and his fruitful bounds.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>Then, doubling Cape Pachynus, we survey
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>The rocky shore extended to the sea.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>The town of Camarine from far we see,
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>And fenny lake, undrain'd by fate's decree.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>In sight of the Geloan fields we pass,
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>And the large walls, where mighty Gela was;
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>Then Agragas, with lofty summits crown'd,
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>Long for the race of warlike steeds renown'd.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>We pass'd Selinus, and the palmy land,
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>And widely shun the Lilybaean strand,
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>Unsafe, for secret rocks and moving sand.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>At length on shore the weary fleet arriv'd,
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>Which Drepanum's unhappy port receiv'd.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>Here, after endless labors, often toss'd
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>By raging storms, and driv'n on ev'ry coast,
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>My dear, dear father, spent with age, I lost:
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>Ease of my cares, and solace of my pain,
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>Sav'd thro' a thousand toils, but sav'd in vain
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>The prophet, who my future woes reveal'd,
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>Yet this, the greatest and the worst, conceal'd;
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>And dire Celaeno, whose foreboding skill
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>Denounc'd all else, was silent of the ill.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>This my last labor was. Some friendly god
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>From thence convey'd us to your blest abode."
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>Thus, to the list'ning queen, the royal guest
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>His wand'ring course and all his toils express'd;
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>And here concluding, he retir'd to rest.
