<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>The gates of heav'n unfold: Jove summons all
<A NAME="11"></A><BR>The gods to council in the common hall.
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>Sublimely seated, he surveys from far
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war,
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>And all th' inferior world. From first to last,
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>The sov'reign senate in degrees are plac'd.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Then thus th' almighty sire began: "Ye gods,
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>Natives or denizens of blest abodes,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>From whence these murmurs, and this change of mind,
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>This backward fate from what was first design'd?
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>Why this protracted war, when my commands
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Pronounc'd a peace, and gave the Latian lands?
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>What fear or hope on either part divides
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>Our heav'ns, and arms our powers on diff'rent sides?
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>A lawful time of war at length will come,
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>(Nor need your haste anticipate the doom),
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome,
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>Then is your time for faction and debate,
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>For partial favor, and permitted hate.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR>Let now your immature dissension cease;
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>Sit quiet, and compose your souls to peace."
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge;
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>But lovely Venus thus replies at large:
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>"O pow'r immense, eternal energy,
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>(For to what else protection can we fly?)
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Seest thou the proud Rutulians, how they dare
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>In fields, unpunish'd, and insult my care?
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>How lofty Turnus vaunts amidst his train,
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>In shining arms, triumphant on the plain?
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>Ev'n in their lines and trenches they contend,
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>And scarce their walls the Trojan troops defend:
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>The town is fill'd with slaughter, and o'erfloats,
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>With a red deluge, their increasing moats.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>Aeneas, ignorant, and far from thence,
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>Has left a camp expos'd, without defense.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>This endless outrage shall they still sustain?
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>Shall Troy renew'd be forc'd and fir'd again?
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>A second siege my banish'd issue fears,
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>And a new Diomede in arms appears.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>One more audacious mortal will be found;
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>And I, thy daughter, wait another wound.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>Yet, if with fates averse, without thy leave,
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>The Latian lands my progeny receive,
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Bear they the pains of violated law,
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>And thy protection from their aid withdraw.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>But, if the gods their sure success foretell;
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>If those of heav'n consent with those of hell,
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>To promise Italy; who dare debate
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>The pow'r of Jove, or fix another fate?
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>What should I tell of tempests on the main,
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Of Aeolus usurping Neptune's reign?
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>Of Iris sent, with Bacchanalian heat
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>T' inspire the matrons, and destroy the fleet?
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Now Juno to the Stygian sky descends,
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>Solicits hell for aid, and arms the fiends.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>That new example wanted yet above:
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>An act that well became the wife of Jove!
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>Alecto, rais'd by her, with rage inflames
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>The peaceful bosoms of the Latian dames.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Imperial sway no more exalts my mind;
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>(Such hopes I had indeed, while Heav'n was kind;)
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>Now let my happier foes possess my place,
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>Whom Jove prefers before the Trojan race;
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>And conquer they, whom you with conquest grace.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>Since you can spare, from all your wide command,
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>No spot of earth, no hospitable land,
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Which may my wand'ring fugitives receive;
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>(Since haughty Juno will not give you leave;)
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>Then, father, (if I still may use that name,)
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>By ruin'd Troy, yet smoking from the flame,
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>I beg you, let Ascanius, by my care,
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>Be freed from danger, and dismiss'd the war:
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Inglorious let him live, without a crown.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>The father may be cast on coasts unknown,
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>Struggling with fate; but let me save the son.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Mine is Cythera, mine the Cyprian tow'rs:
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>In those recesses, and those sacred bow'rs,
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>Obscurely let him rest; his right resign
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>To promis'd empire, and his Julian line.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>Then Carthage may th' Ausonian towns destroy,
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Nor fear the race of a rejected boy.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>What profits it my son to scape the fire,
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>Arm'd with his gods, and loaded with his sire;
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>To pass the perils of the seas and wind;
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>Evade the Greeks, and leave the war behind;
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>To reach th' Italian shores; if, after all,
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Our second Pergamus is doom'd to fall?
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>Much better had he curb'd his high desires,
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>And hover'd o'er his ill-extinguish'd fires.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>To Simois' banks the fugitives restore,
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>And give them back to war, and all the woes before."
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Deep indignation swell'd Saturnia's heart:
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>"And must I own," she said, "my secret smart-
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>What with more decence were in silence kept,
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>And, but for this unjust reproach, had slept?
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>Did god or man your fav'rite son advise,
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>With war unhop'd the Latians to surprise?
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>By fate, you boast, and by the gods' decree,
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>He left his native land for Italy!
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>Confess the truth; by mad Cassandra, more
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>Than Heav'n inspir'd, he sought a foreign shore!
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>Did I persuade to trust his second Troy
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>To the raw conduct of a beardless boy,
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>With walls unfinish'd, which himself forsakes,
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>And thro' the waves a wand'ring voyage takes?
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>When have I urg'd him meanly to demand
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>The Tuscan aid, and arm a quiet land?
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>Did I or Iris give this mad advice,
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Or made the fool himself the fatal choice?
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>You think it hard, the Latians should destroy
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>With swords your Trojans, and with fires your Troy!
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>Hard and unjust indeed, for men to draw
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Their native air, nor take a foreign law!
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>That Turnus is permitted still to live,
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>To whom his birth a god and goddess give!
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>But yet is just and lawful for your line
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>To drive their fields, and force with fraud to join;
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>Realms, not your own, among your clans divide,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>And from the bridegroom tear the promis'd bride;
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Petition, while you public arms prepare;
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Pretend a peace, and yet provoke a war!
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>'T was giv'n to you, your darling son to shroud,
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>To draw the dastard from the fighting crowd,
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>And, for a man, obtend an empty cloud.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>From flaming fleets you turn'd the fire away,
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>And chang'd the ships to daughters of the sea.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>But is my crime- the Queen of Heav'n offends,
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>If she presume to save her suff'ring friends!
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>Your son, not knowing what his foes decree,
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>You say, is absent: absent let him be.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>Yours is Cythera, yours the Cyprian tow'rs,
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>The soft recesses, and the sacred bow'rs.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Why do you then these needless arms prepare,
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>And thus provoke a people prone to war?
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>Did I with fire the Trojan town deface,
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>Or hinder from return your exil'd race?
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>Was I the cause of mischief, or the man
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Whose lawless lust the fatal war began?
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>Think on whose faith th' adult'rous youth relied;
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Who promis'd, who procur'd, the Spartan bride?
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>When all th' united states of Greece combin'd,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>To purge the world of the perfidious kind,
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>Then was your time to fear the Trojan fate:
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Your quarrels and complaints are now too late."
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>Thus Juno. Murmurs rise, with mix'd applause,
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>Just as they favor or dislike the cause.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>So winds, when yet unfledg'd in woods they lie,
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>In whispers first their tender voices try,
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>Then issue on the main with bellowing rage,
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>And storms to trembling mariners presage.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>Then thus to both replied th' imperial god,
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>Who shakes heav'n's axles with his awful nod.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>(When he begins, the silent senate stand
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>With rev'rence, list'ning to the dread command:
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>The clouds dispel; the winds their breath restrain;
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>And the hush'd waves lie flatted on the main.)
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>"Celestials, your attentive ears incline!
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>Since," said the god, "the Trojans must not join
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>In wish'd alliance with the Latian line;
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Since endless jarrings and immortal hate
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Tend but to discompose our happy state;
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>The war henceforward be resign'd to fate:
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>Each to his proper fortune stand or fall;
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Equal and unconcern'd I look on all.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>Rutulians, Trojans, are the same to me;
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>And both shall draw the lots their fates decree.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>Let these assault, if Fortune be their friend;
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>And, if she favors those, let those defend:
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>The Fates will find their way." The Thund'rer said,
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>And shook the sacred honors of his head,
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Attesting Styx, th' inviolable flood,
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>And the black regions of his brother god.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>Trembled the poles of heav'n, and earth confess'd the 
<A NAME="185"></A>nod.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>This end the sessions had: the senate rise,
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>And to his palace wait their sov'reign thro' the 
<A NAME="188"></A>skies.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Meantime, intent upon their siege, the foes
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Within their walls the Trojan host inclose:
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>They wound, they kill, they watch at ev'ry gate;
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Renew the fires, and urge their happy fate.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Th' Aeneans wish in vain their wanted chief,
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Hopeless of flight, more hopeless of relief.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Thin on the tow'rs they stand; and ev'n those few
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>A feeble, fainting, and dejected crew.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>Yet in the face of danger some there stood:
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>The two bold brothers of Sarpedon's blood,
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>Asius and Acmon; both th' Assaraci;
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>Young Haemon, and tho' young, resolv'd to die.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>With these were Clarus and Thymoetes join'd;
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Tibris and Castor, both of Lycian kind.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>From Acmon's hands a rolling stone there came,
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>So large, it half deserv'd a mountain's name:
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>Strong-sinew'd was the youth, and big of bone;
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>His brother Mnestheus could not more have done,
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>Or the great father of th' intrepid son.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>Some firebrands throw, some flights of arrows send;
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>And some with darts, and some with stones defend.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Amid the press appears the beauteous boy,
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>The care of Venus, and the hope of Troy.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>His lovely face unarm'd, his head was bare;
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>In ringlets o'er his shoulders hung his hair.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>His forehead circled with a diadem;
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>Distinguish'd from the crowd, he shines a gem,
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Enchas'd in gold, or polish'd iv'ry set,
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>Amidst the meaner foil of sable jet.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>Nor Ismarus was wanting to the war,
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>Directing pointed arrows from afar,
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>And death with poison arm'd- in Lydia born,
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>Where plenteous harvests the fat fields adorn;
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Where proud Pactolus floats the fruitful lands,
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>And leaves a rich manure of golden sands.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>There Capys, author of the Capuan name,
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>And there was Mnestheus too, increas'd in fame,
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Since Turnus from the camp he cast with shame.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>Thus mortal war was wag'd on either side.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>Meantime the hero cuts the nightly tide:
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>For, anxious, from Evander when he went,
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>He sought the Tyrrhene camp, and Tarchon's tent;
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Expos'd the cause of coming to the chief;
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>His name and country told, and ask'd relief;
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>Propos'd the terms; his own small strength declar'd;
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>What vengeance proud Mezentius had prepar'd:
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>What Turnus, bold and violent, design'd;
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>Then shew'd the slipp'ry state of humankind,
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>And fickle fortune; warn'd him to beware,
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>And to his wholesome counsel added pray'r.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>Tarchon, without delay, the treaty signs,
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>And to the Trojan troops the Tuscan joins.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>They soon set sail; nor now the fates withstand;
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>Their forces trusted with a foreign hand.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>Aeneas leads; upon his stern appear
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Two lions carv'd, which rising Ida bear-
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Ida, to wand'ring Trojans ever dear.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>Under their grateful shade Aeneas sate,
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Revolving war's events, and various fate.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>His left young Pallas kept, fix'd to his side,
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>And oft of winds enquir'd, and of the tide;
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>Oft of the stars, and of their wat'ry way;
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>And what he suffer'd both by land and sea.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Now, sacred sisters, open all your spring!
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>The Tuscan leaders, and their army sing,
<A NAME="254"></A><BR>Which follow'd great Aeneas to the war:
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Their arms, their numbers, and their names declare.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>A thousand youths brave Massicus obey,
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>Borne in the Tiger thro' the foaming sea;
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>From Asium brought, and Cosa, by his care:
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>For arms, light quivers, bows and shafts, they bear.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>Fierce Abas next: his men bright armor wore;
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>His stern Apollo's golden statue bore.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Six hundred Populonia sent along,
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>All skill'd in martial exercise, and strong.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Three hundred more for battle Ilva joins,
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>An isle renown'd for steel, and unexhausted mines.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>Asylas on his prow the third appears,
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>Who heav'n interprets, and the wand'ring stars;
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>From offer'd entrails prodigies expounds,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>And peals of thunder, with presaging sounds.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>A thousand spears in warlike order stand,
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Sent by the Pisans under his command.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Fair Astur follows in the wat'ry field,
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>Proud of his manag'd horse and painted shield.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Gravisca, noisome from the neighb'ring fen,
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>And his own Caere, sent three hundred men;
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>With those which Minio's fields and Pyrgi gave,
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>All bred in arms, unanimous, and brave.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>Thou, Muse, the name of Cinyras renew,
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>And brave Cupavo follow'd but by few;
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>Whose helm confess'd the lineage of the man,
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>And bore, with wings display'd, a silver swan.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>Love was the fault of his fam'd ancestry,
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Whose forms and fortunes in his ensigns fly.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>For Cycnus lov'd unhappy Phaeton,
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>And sung his loss in poplar groves, alone,
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Beneath the sister shades, to soothe his grief.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>Heav'n heard his song, and hasten'd his relief,
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>And chang'd to snowy plumes his hoary hair,
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>And wing'd his flight, to chant aloft in air.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>His son Cupavo brush'd the briny flood:
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Upon his stern a brawny Centaur stood,
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Who heav'd a rock, and, threat'ning still to throw,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>With lifted hands alarm'd the seas below:
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>They seem'd to fear the formidable sight,
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>And roll'd their billows on, to speed his flight.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Ocnus was next, who led his native train
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>Of hardy warriors thro' the wat'ry plain:
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>The son of Manto by the Tuscan stream,
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>From whence the Mantuan town derives the name-
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>An ancient city, but of mix'd descent:
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>Three sev'ral tribes compose the government;
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>Four towns are under each; but all obey
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>The Mantuan laws, and own the Tuscan sway.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>Hate to Mezentius arm'd five hundred more,
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Whom Mincius from his sire Benacus bore:
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>Mincius, with wreaths of reeds his forehead cover'd 
<A NAME="307"></A>o'er.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>These grave Auletes leads: a hundred sweep
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>With stretching oars at once the glassy deep.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Him and his martial train the Triton bears;
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>High on his poop the sea-green god appears:
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>Frowning he seems his crooked shell to sound,
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>And at the blast the billows dance around.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>A hairy man above the waist he shows;
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>A porpoise tail beneath his belly grows;
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>And ends a fish: his breast the waves divides,
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>And froth and foam augment the murm'ring tides.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Full thirty ships transport the chosen train
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>For Troy's relief, and scour the briny main.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Now was the world forsaken by the sun,
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>And Phoebe half her nightly race had run.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>The careful chief, who never clos'd his eyes,
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>Himself the rudder holds, the sails supplies.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>A choir of Nereids meet him on the flood,
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>Once his own galleys, hewn from Ida's wood;
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>But now, as many nymphs, the sea they sweep,
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>As rode, before, tall vessels on the deep.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>They know him from afar; and in a ring
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Inclose the ship that bore the Trojan king.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Cymodoce, whose voice excell'd the rest,
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Above the waves advanc'd her snowy breast;
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Her right hand stops the stern; her left divides
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>The curling ocean, and corrects the tides.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>She spoke for all the choir, and thus began
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>With pleasing words to warn th' unknowing man:
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>"Sleeps our lov'd lord? O goddess-born, awake!
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>Spread ev'ry sail, pursue your wat'ry track,
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>And haste your course. Your navy once were we,
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>From Ida's height descending to the sea;
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Till Turnus, as at anchor fix'd we stood,
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Presum'd to violate our holy wood.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>Then, loos'd from shore, we fled his fires profane
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>(Unwillingly we broke our master's chain),
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>And since have sought you thro' the Tuscan main.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>The mighty Mother chang'd our forms to these,
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>And gave us life immortal in the seas.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>But young Ascanius, in his camp distress'd,
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>By your insulting foes is hardly press'd.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Th' Arcadian horsemen, and Etrurian host,
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>Advance in order on the Latian coast:
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>To cut their way the Daunian chief designs,
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>Before their troops can reach the Trojan lines.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Thou, when the rosy morn restores the light,
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>First arm thy soldiers for th' ensuing fight:
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Thyself the fated sword of Vulcan wield,
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>And bear aloft th' impenetrable shield.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>To-morrow's sun, unless my skill be vain,
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>Shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain."
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Parting, she spoke; and with immortal force
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Push'd on the vessel in her wat'ry course;
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>For well she knew the way. Impell'd behind,
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>The ship flew forward, and outstripp'd the wind.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>The rest make up. Unknowing of the cause,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>The chief admires their speed, and happy omens draws.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Then thus he pray'd, and fix'd on heav'n his eyes:
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>"Hear thou, great Mother of the deities.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>With turrets crown'd! (on Ida's holy hill
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>Fierce tigers, rein'd and curb'd, obey thy will.)
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>Firm thy own omens; lead us on to fight;
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>And let thy Phrygians conquer in thy right."
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>He said no more. And now renewing day
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>Had chas'd the shadows of the night away.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>He charg'd the soldiers, with preventing care,
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>Their flags to follow, and their arms prepare;
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>Warn'd of th' ensuing fight, and bade 'em hope the 
<A NAME="376"></A>war.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>Now, his lofty poop, he view'd below
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>His camp incompass'd, and th' inclosing foe.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>His blazing shield, imbrac'd, he held on high;
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>The camp receive the sign, and with loud shouts 
<A NAME="381"></A>reply.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Hope arms their courage: from their tow'rs they 
<A NAME="383"></A>throw
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>Their darts with double force, and drive the foe.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>Thus, at the signal giv'n, the cranes arise
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Before the stormy south, and blacken all the skies.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>King Turnus wonder'd at the fight renew'd,
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Till, looking back, the Trojan fleet he view'd,
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>The seas with swelling canvas cover'd o'er,
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>And the swift ships descending on the shore.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>The Latians saw from far, with dazzled eyes,
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>The radiant crest that seem'd in flames to rise,
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>And dart diffusive fires around the field,
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>And the keen glitt'ring the golden shield.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>Thus threat'ning comets, when by night they rise,
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>Shoot sanguine streams, and sadden all the skies:
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>So Sirius, flashing forth sinister lights,
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Pale humankind with plagues and with dry famine 
<A NAME="399"></A>fright:
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Yet Turnus with undaunted mind is bent
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>To man the shores, and hinder their descent,
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>And thus awakes the courage of his friends:
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>"What you so long have wish'd, kind Fortune sends;
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>In ardent arms to meet th' invading foe:
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>You find, and find him at advantage now.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Yours is the day: you need but only dare;
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>Your swords will make you masters of the war.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>Your sires, your sons, your houses, and your lands,
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>And dearest wifes, are all within your hands.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Be mindful of the race from whence you came,
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>And emulate in arms your fathers' fame.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Now take the time, while stagg'ring yet they stand
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>With feet unfirm, and prepossess the strand:
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Fortune befriends the bold." Nor more he said,
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>But balanc'd whom to leave, and whom to lead;
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>Then these elects, the landing to prevent;
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>And those he leaves, to keep the city pent.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>Meantime the Trojan sends his troops ashore:
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Some are by boats expos'd, by bridges more.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>With lab'ring oars they bear along the strand,
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>Where the tide languishes, and leap aland.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Tarchon observes the coast with careful eyes,
<A NAME="423"></A><BR>And, where no ford he finds, no water fries,
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Nor billows with unequal murmurs roar,
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>But smoothly slide along, and swell the shore,
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>That course he steer'd, and thus he gave command:
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>"Here ply your oars, and at all hazard land:
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>Force on the vessel, that her keel may wound
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>This hated soil, and furrow hostile ground.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Let me securely land- I ask no more;
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>Then sink my ships, or shatter on the shore."
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>This fiery speech inflames his fearful friends:
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>They tug at ev'ry oar, and ev'ry stretcher bends;
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>They run their ships aground; the vessels knock,
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>(Thus forc'd ashore,) and tremble with the shock.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Tarchon's alone was lost, that stranded stood,
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>Stuck on a bank, and beaten by the flood:
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>She breaks her back; the loosen'd sides give way,
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>And plunge the Tuscan soldiers in the sea.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>Their broken oars and floating planks withstand
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Their passage, while they labor to the land,
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>And ebbing tides bear back upon th' uncertain sand.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>Now Turnus leads his troops without delay,
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>Advancing to the margin of the sea.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>The trumpets sound: Aeneas first assail'd
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>The clowns new-rais'd and raw, and soon prevail'd.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Great Theron fell, an omen of the fight;
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Great Theron, large of limbs, of giant height.
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>He first in open field defied the prince:
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>But armor scal'd with gold was no defense
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>Against the fated sword, which open'd wide
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>His plated shield, and pierc'd his naked side.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>Next, Lichas fell, who, not like others born,
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>Was from his wretched mother ripp'd and torn;
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>Sacred, O Phoebus, from his birth to thee;
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>For his beginning life from biting steel was free.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>Not far from him was Gyas laid along,
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Of monstrous bulk; with Cisseus fierce and strong:
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Vain bulk and strength! for, when the chief assail'd,
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>Nor valor nor Herculean arms avail'd,
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>Nor their fam'd father, wont in war to go
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>With great Alcides, while he toil'd below.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>The noisy Pharos next receiv'd his death:
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>Aeneas writh'd his dart, and stopp'd his bawling 
<A NAME="465"></A>breath.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>Then wretched Cydon had receiv'd his doom,
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>Who courted Clytius in his beardless bloom,
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>And sought with lust obscene polluted joys:
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>The Trojan sword had curd his love of boys,
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>Had not his sev'n bold brethren stopp'd the course
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>Of the fierce champions, with united force.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>Sev'n darts were thrown at once; and some rebound
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>From his bright shield, some on his helmet sound:
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>The rest had reach'd him; but his mother's care
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Prevented those, and turn'd aside in air.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>The prince then call'd Achates, to supply
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>The spears that knew the way to victory-
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>"Those fatal weapons, which, inur'd to blood,
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>In Grecian bodies under Ilium stood:
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>Not one of those my hand shall toss in vain
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>Against our foes, on this contended plain."
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>He said; then seiz'd a mighty spear, and threw;
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>Which, wing'd with fate, thro' Maeon's buckler flew,
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Pierc'd all the brazen plates, and reach'd his heart:
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>He stagger'd with intolerable smart.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Alcanor saw; and reach'd, but reach'd in vain,
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>His helping hand, his brother to sustain.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>A second spear, which kept the former course,
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>From the same hand, and sent with equal force,
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>His right arm pierc'd, and holding on, bereft
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>His use of both, and pinion'd down his left.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>Then Numitor from his dead brother drew
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>Th' ill-omen'd spear, and at the Trojan threw:
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>Preventing fate directs the lance awry,
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>Which, glancing, only mark'd Achates' thigh.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>In pride of youth the Sabine Clausus came,
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>And, from afar, at Dryops took his aim.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>The spear flew hissing thro' the middle space,
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>And pierc'd his throat, directed at his face;
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>It stopp'd at once the passage of his wind,
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>And the free soul to flitting air resign'd:
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>His forehead was the first that struck the ground;
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>Lifeblood and life rush'd mingled thro' the wound.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>He slew three brothers of the Borean race,
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>And three, whom Ismarus, their native place,
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Had sent to war, but all the sons of Thrace.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>Halesus, next, the bold Aurunci leads:
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>The son of Neptune to his aid succeeds,
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Conspicuous on his horse. On either hand,
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>These fight to keep, and those to win, the land.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>With mutual blood th' Ausonian soil is dyed,
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>While on its borders each their claim decide.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>As wintry winds, contending in the sky,
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>With equal force of lungs their titles try:
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>They rage, they roar; the doubtful rack of heav'n
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Stands without motion, and the tide undriv'n:
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>Each bent to conquer, neither side to yield,
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>They long suspend the fortune of the field.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>Both armies thus perform what courage can;
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>Foot set to foot, and mingled man to man.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>But, in another part, th' Arcadian horse
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>With ill success ingage the Latin force:
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>For, where th' impetuous torrent, rushing down,
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>Huge craggy stones and rooted trees had thrown,
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>They left their coursers, and, unus'd to fight
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>On foot, were scatter'd in a shameful flight.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>Pallas, who with disdain and grief had view'd
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>His foes pursuing, and his friends pursued,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>Us'd threat'nings mix'd with pray'rs, his last resource,
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>With these to move their minds, with those to fire their 
<A NAME="531"></A>force
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>"Which way, companions? whether would you run?
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>By you yourselves, and mighty battles won,
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>By my great sire, by his establish'd name,
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>And early promise of my future fame;
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>By my youth, emulous of equal right
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>To share his honors- shun ignoble flight!
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>Trust not your feet: your hands must hew way
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Thro' yon black body, and that thick array:
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>'T is thro' that forward path that we must come;
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>There lies our way, and that our passage home.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>Nor pow'rs above, nor destinies below
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>Oppress our arms: with equal strength we go,
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>With mortal hands to meet a mortal foe.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>See on what foot we stand: a scanty shore,
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>The sea behind, our enemies before;
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>No passage left, unless we swim the main;
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Or, forcing these, the Trojan trenches gain."
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>This said, he strode with eager haste along,
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>And bore amidst the thickest of the throng.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>Lagus, the first he met, with fate to foe,
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Had heav'd a stone of mighty weight, to throw:
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>Stooping, the spear descended on his chine,
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Just where the bone distinguished either loin:
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>It stuck so fast, so deeply buried lay,
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>That scarce the victor forc'd the steel away.
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>Hisbon came on: but, while he mov'd too slow
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>To wish'd revenge, the prince prevents his blow;
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>For, warding his at once, at once he press'd,
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>And plung'd the fatal weapon in his breast.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>Then lewd Anchemolus he laid in dust,
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>Who stain'd his stepdam's bed with impious lust.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>And, after him, the Daucian twins were slain,
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Laris and Thymbrus, on the Latian plain;
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>So wondrous like in feature, shape, and size,
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>As caus'd an error in their parents' eyes-
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Grateful mistake! but soon the sword decides
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>The nice distinction, and their fate divides:
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>For Thymbrus' head was lopp'd; and Laris' hand,
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Dismember'd, sought its owner on the strand:
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>The trembling fingers yet the fauchion strain,
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>And threaten still th' intended stroke in vain.
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>Now, to renew the charge, th' Arcadians came:
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Sight of such acts, and sense of honest shame,
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>And grief, with anger mix'd, their minds inflame.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>Then, with a casual blow was Rhoeteus slain,
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Who chanc'd, as Pallas threw, to cross the plain:
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>The flying spear was after Ilus sent;
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>But Rhoeteus happen'd on a death unmeant:
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>From Teuthras and from Tyres while he fled,
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>The lance, athwart his body, laid him dead:
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>Roll'd from his chariot with a mortal wound,
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>And intercepted fate, he spurn'd the ground.
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>As when, in summer, welcome winds arise,
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>The watchful shepherd to the forest flies,
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>And fires the midmost plants; contagion spreads,
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>And catching flames infect the neighb'ring heads;
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Around the forest flies the furious blast,
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>And all the leafy nation sinks at last,
<A NAME="590"></A><BR>And Vulcan rides in triumph o'er the waste;
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>The pastor, pleas'd with his dire victory,
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the 
<A NAME="593"></A>sky:
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>So Pallas' troops their scatter'd strength unite,
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>And, pouring on their foes, their prince delight.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Halesus came, fierce with desire of blood;
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>But first collected in his arms he stood:
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Advancing then, he plied the spear so well,
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>Ladon, Demodocus, and Pheres fell.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Around his head he toss'd his glitt'ring brand,
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>And from Strymonius hew'd his better hand,
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Held up to guard his throat; then hurl'd a stone
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>At Thoas' ample front, and pierc'd the bone:
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>It struck beneath the space of either eye;
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>And blood, and mingled brains, together fly.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Deep skill'd in future fates, Halesus' sire
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>Did with the youth to lonely groves retire:
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>But, when the father's mortal race was run,
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Dire destiny laid hold upon the son,
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>And haul'd him to the war, to find, beneath
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>Th' Evandrian spear, a memorable death.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>Pallas th' encounter seeks, but, ere he throws,
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>To Tuscan Tiber thus address'd his vows:
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>"O sacred stream, direct my flying dart,
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>And give to pass the proud Halesus' heart!
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>His arms and spoils thy holy oak shall bear."
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>Pleas'd with the bribe, the god receiv'd his pray'r:
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>For, while his shield protects a friend distress'd,
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>The dart came driving on, and pierc'd his breast.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>But Lausus, no small portion of the war,
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Permits not panic fear to reign too far,
<A NAME="622"></A><BR>Caus'd by the death of so renown'd a knight;
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>But by his own example cheers the fight.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>Fierce Abas first he slew; Abas, the stay
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>Of Trojan hopes, and hindrance of the day.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>The Phrygian troops escap'd the Greeks in vain:
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>They, and their mix'd allies, now load the plain.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>To the rude shock of war both armies came;
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>Their leaders equal, and their strength the same.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>The rear so press'd the front, they could not wield
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>Their angry weapons, to dispute the field.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>Here Pallas urges on, and Lausus there:
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>Of equal youth and beauty both appear,
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>But both by fate forbid to breathe their native 
<A NAME="635"></A>air.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Their congress in the field great Jove withstands:
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Both doom'd to fall, but fall by greater hands.
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>Meantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>Of Lausus' danger, urging swift relief.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>With his driv'n chariot he divides the crowd,
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>And, making to his friends, thus calls aloud:
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>"Let none presume his needless aid to join;
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>Retire, and clear the field; the fight is mine:
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>To this right hand is Pallas only due;
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>O were his father here, my just revenge to view!"
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>From the forbidden space his men retir'd.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>Pallas their awe, and his stern words, admir'd;
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Survey'd him o'er and o'er with wond'ring sight,
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>Struck with his haughty mien, and tow'ring height.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>Then to the king: "Your empty vaunts forbear;
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>Success I hope, and fate I cannot fear;
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Alive or dead, I shall deserve a name;
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>Jove is impartial, and to both the same."
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>He said, and to the void advanc'd his pace:
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>Pale horror sate on each Arcadian face.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Then Turnus, from his chariot leaping light,
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>Address'd himself on foot to single fight.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>And, as a lion- when he spies from far
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>A bull that seems to meditate the war,
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>Bending his neck, and spurning back the sand-
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>Runs roaring downward from his hilly stand:
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>Imagine eager Turnus not more slow,
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>To rush from high on his unequal foe.
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>Young Pallas, when he saw the chief advance
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>Within due distance of his flying lance,
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>Prepares to charge him first, resolv'd to try
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>If fortune would his want of force supply;
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>And thus to Heav'n and Hercules address'd:
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>"Alcides, once on earth Evander's guest,
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>His son adjures you by those holy rites,
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>That hospitable board, those genial nights;
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>Assist my great attempt to gain this prize,
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>And let proud Turnus view, with dying eyes,
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>His ravish'd spoils." 'T was heard, the vain request;
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>Alcides mourn'd, and stifled sighs within his breast.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>Then Jove, to soothe his sorrow, thus began:
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>"Short bounds of life are set to mortal man.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>'T is virtue's work alone to stretch the narrow 
<A NAME="679"></A>span.
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>So many sons of gods, in bloody fight,
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>Around the walls of Troy, have lost the light:
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>My own Sarpedon fell beneath his foe;
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>Nor I, his mighty sire, could ward the blow.
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>Ev'n Turnus shortly shall resign his breath,
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>And stands already on the verge of death."
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>This said, the god permits the fatal fight,
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>But from the Latian fields averts his sight.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>Now with full force his spear young Pallas threw,
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>And, having thrown, his shining fauchion drew
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>The steel just graz'd along the shoulder joint,
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>And mark'd it slightly with the glancing point,
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>Fierce Turnus first to nearer distance drew,
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>And pois'd his pointed spear, before he threw:
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>Then, as the winged weapon whizz'd along,
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>"See now," said he, "whose arm is better strung."
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>The spear kept on the fatal course, unstay'd
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>By plates of ir'n, which o'er the shield were laid:
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>Thro' folded brass and tough bull hides it pass'd,
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>His corslet pierc'd, and reach'd his heart at last.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>In vain the youth tugs at the broken wood;
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>The soul comes issuing with the vital blood:
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>He falls; his arms upon his body sound;
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>And with his bloody teeth he bites the ground.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Turnus bestrode the corpse: "Arcadians, hear,"
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>Said he; "my message to your master bear:
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>Such as the sire deserv'd, the son I send;
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>It costs him dear to be the Phrygians' friend.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>The lifeless body, tell him, I bestow,
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>Unask'd, to rest his wand'ring ghost below."
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>He said, and trampled down with all the force
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>Of his left foot, and spurn'd the wretched corse;
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>Then snatch'd the shining belt, with gold inlaid;
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>The belt Eurytion's artful hands had made,
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>Where fifty fatal brides, express'd to sight,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>All in the compass of one mournful night,
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>Depriv'd their bridegrooms of returning light.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>In an ill hour insulting Turnus tore
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>Those golden spoils, and in a worse he wore.
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>O mortals, blind in fate, who never know
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>To bear high fortune, or endure the low!
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>The time shall come, when Turnus, but in vain,
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Shall wish untouch'd the trophies of the slain;
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Shall wish the fatal belt were far away,
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>And curse the dire remembrance of the day.
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>The sad Arcadians, from th' unhappy field,
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>Bear back the breathless body on a shield.
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>O grace and grief of war! at once restor'd,
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>With praises, to thy sire, at once deplor'd!
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>One day first sent thee to the fighting field,
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Beheld whole heaps of foes in battle kill'd;
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>One day beheld thee dead, and borne upon thy shield.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>This dismal news, not from uncertain fame,
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>But sad spectators, to the hero came:
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>His friends upon the brink of ruin stand,
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>Unless reliev'd by his victorious hand.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>He whirls his sword around, without delay,
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>And hews thro' adverse foes an ample way,
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>To find fierce Turnus, of his conquest proud:
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>Evander, Pallas, all that friendship ow'd
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>To large deserts, are present to his eyes;
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>His plighted hand, and hospitable ties.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>Four sons of Sulmo, four whom Ufens bred,
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>He took in fight, and living victims led,
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>To please the ghost of Pallas, and expire,
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>In sacrifice, before his fun'ral fire.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>At Magus next he threw: he stoop'd below
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>The flying spear, and shunn'd the promis'd blow;
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>Then, creeping, clasp'd the hero's knees, and pray'd:
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>"By young Iulus, by thy father's shade,
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>O spare my life, and send me back to see
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>My longing sire, and tender progeny!
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>A lofty house I have, and wealth untold,
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>In silver ingots, and in bars of gold:
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>All these, and sums besides, which see no day,
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>The ransom of this one poor life shall pay.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>If I survive, will Troy the less prevail?
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>A single soul's too light to turn the scale."
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>He said. The hero sternly thus replied:
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>"Thy bars and ingots, and the sums beside,
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>Leave for thy children's lot. Thy Turnus broke
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>All rules of war by one relentless stroke,
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>When Pallas fell: so deems, nor deems alone
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>My father's shadow, but my living son."
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>Thus having said, of kind remorse bereft,
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>He seiz'd his helm, and dragg'd him with his left;
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>Then with his right hand, while his neck he wreath'd,
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>Up to the hilts his shining fauchion sheath'd.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>Apollo's priest, Emonides, was near;
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>His holy fillets on his front appear;
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>Glitt'ring in arms, he shone amidst the crowd;
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>Much of his god, more of his purple, proud.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>Him the fierce Trojan follow'd thro' the field:
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>The holy coward fell; and, forc'd to yield,
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>The prince stood o'er the priest, and, at one blow,
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>Sent him an off'ring to the shades below.
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>His arms Seresthus on his shoulders bears,
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Design'd a trophy to the God of Wars.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>Vulcanian Caeculus renews the fight,
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>And Umbro, born upon the mountains' height.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>The champion cheers his troops t' encounter those,
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>And seeks revenge himself on other foes.
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>At Anxur's shield he drove; and, at the blow,
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>Both shield and arm to ground together go.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>Anxur had boasted much of magic charms,
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>And thought he wore impenetrable arms,
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>So made by mutter'd spells; and, from the spheres,
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>Had life secur'd, in vain, for length of years.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>Then Tarquitus the field triumph trod;
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>A nymph his mother, his sire a god.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>Exulting in bright arms, he braves the prince:
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>With his protended lance he makes defense;
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>Bears back his feeble foe; then, pressing on,
<A NAME="793"></A><BR>Arrests his better hand, and drags him down;
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>Stands o'er the prostrate wretch, and, as he lay,
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>Vain tales inventing, and prepar'd to pray,
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>Mows off his head: the trunk a moment stood,
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>Then sunk, and roll'd along the sand in blood.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>The vengeful victor thus upbraids the slain:
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>"Lie there, proud man, unpitied, on the plain;
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>Lie there, inglorious, and without a tomb,
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>Far from thy mother and thy native home,
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Exposed to savage beasts, and birds of prey,
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>Or thrown for food to monsters of the sea."
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>On Lycas and Antaeus next he ran,
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>Two chiefs of Turnus, and who led his van.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR>They fled for fear; with these, he chas'd along
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>Camers the yellow-lock'd, and Numa strong;
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>Both great in arms, and both were fair and young.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>Camers was son to Volscens lately slain,
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>In wealth surpassing all the Latian train,
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>And in Amycla fix'd his silent easy reign.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>And, as Aegaeon, when with heav'n he strove,
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>Stood opposite in arms to mighty Jove;
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>Mov'd all his hundred hands, provok'd the war,
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>Defied the forky lightning from afar;
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>At fifty mouths his flaming breath expires,
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>And flash for flash returns, and fires for fires;
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>In his right hand as many swords he wields,
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>And takes the thunder on as many shields:
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>With strength like his, the Trojan hero stood;
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>And soon the fields with falling corps were strow'd,
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>When once his fauchion found the taste of blood.
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>With fury scarce to be conceiv'd, he flew
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Against Niphaeus, whom four coursers drew.
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>They, when they see the fiery chief advance,
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>And pushing at their chests his pointed lance,
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>Wheel'd with so swift a motion, mad with fear,
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>They threw their master headlong from the chair.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>They stare, they start, nor stop their course, before
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>They bear the bounding chariot to the shore.
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>Now Lucagus and Liger scour the plains,
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>With two white steeds; but Liger holds the reins,
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>And Lucagus the lofty seat maintains:
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>Bold brethren both. The former wav'd in air
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>His flaming sword: Aeneas couch'd his spear,
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>Unus'd to threats, and more unus'd to fear.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>Then Liger thus: "Thy confidence is vain
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>To scape from hence, as from the Trojan plain:
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>Nor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode,
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>Nor this the chariot where Achilles rode;
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>Nor Venus' veil is here, near Neptune's shield;
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>Thy fatal hour is come, and this the field."
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>Thus Liger vainly vaunts: the Trojan
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>Return'd his answer with his flying spear.
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>As Lucagus, to lash his horses, bends,
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>Prone to the wheels, and his left foot protends,
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>Prepar'd for fight; the fatal dart arrives,
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>And thro' the borders of his buckler drives;
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>Pass'd thro' and pierc'd his groin: the deadly wound,
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>Cast from his chariot, roll'd him on the ground.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>Whom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite:
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>"Blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight;
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>Vain shadows did not force their swift retreat;
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>But you yourself forsake your empty seat."
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>He said, and seiz'd at once the loosen'd rein;
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>For Liger lay already on the plain,
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>By the same shock: then, stretching out his hands,
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>The recreant thus his wretched life demands:
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>"Now, by thyself, O more than mortal man!
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>By her and him from whom thy breath began,
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>Who form'd thee thus divine, I beg thee, spare
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>This forfeit life, and hear thy suppliant's pray'r."
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>Thus much he spoke, and more he would have said;
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>But the stern hero turn'd aside his head,
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>And cut him short: "I hear another man;
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>You talk'd not thus before the fight began.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>Now take your turn; and, as a brother should,
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>Attend your brother to the Stygian flood."
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>Then thro' his breast his fatal sword he sent,
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>And the soul issued at the gaping vent.
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>As storms the skies, and torrents tear the ground,
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>Thus rag'd the prince, and scatter'd deaths around.
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>At length Ascanius and the Trojan train
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>Broke from the camp, so long besieg'd in vain.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>Meantime the King of Gods and Mortal Man
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>Held conference with his queen, and thus began:
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>"My sister goddess, and well-pleasing wife,
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>Still think you Venus' aid supports the strife-
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>Sustains her Trojans- or themselves, alone,
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>With inborn valor force their fortune on?
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>How fierce in fight, with courage undecay'd!
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>Judge if such warriors want immortal aid."
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>To whom the goddess with the charming eyes,
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>Soft in her tone, submissively replies:
<A NAME="885"></A><BR>"Why, O my sov'reign lord, whose frown I fear,
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>And cannot, unconcern'd, your anger bear;
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>Why urge you thus my grief? when, if I still
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>(As once I was) were mistress of your will,
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>From your almighty pow'r your pleasing wife
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>Might gain the grace of length'ning Turnus' life,
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>Securely snatch him from the fatal fight,
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>And give him to his aged father's sight.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>Now let him perish, since you hold it good,
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>And glut the Trojans with his pious blood.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>Yet from our lineage he derives his name,
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>And, in the fourth degree, from god Pilumnus came;
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>Yet he devoutly pays you rites divine,
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>And offers daily incense at your shrine."
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>Then shortly thus the sov'reign god replied:
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>"Since in my pow'r and goodness you confide,
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>If for a little space, a lengthen'd span,
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>You beg reprieve for this expiring man,
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>I grant you leave to take your Turnus hence
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>From instant fate, and can so far dispense.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>But, if some secret meaning lies beneath,
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>To save the short-liv'd youth from destin'd death,
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>Or if a farther thought you entertain,
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>To change the fates; you feed your hopes in vain."
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>To whom the goddess thus, with weeping eyes:
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>"And what if that request, your tongue denies,
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>Your heart should grant; and not a short reprieve,
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>But length of certain life, to Turnus give?
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>Now speedy death attends the guiltless youth,
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>If my presaging soul divines with truth;
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>Which, O! I wish, might err thro' causeless fears,
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>And you (for you have pow'r) prolong his years!"
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>Thus having said, involv'd in clouds, she flies,
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>And drives a storm before her thro' the skies.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>Swift she descends, alighting on the plain,
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>Where the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain.
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>Of air condens'd a specter soon she made;
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>And, what Aeneas was, such seem'd the shade.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>Adorn'd with Dardan arms, the phantom bore
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>His head aloft; a plumy crest he wore;
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>This hand appear'd a shining sword to wield,.
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>And that sustain'd an imitated shield.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>With manly mien he stalk'd along the ground,
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>Nor wanted voice belied, nor vaunting sound.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>(Thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight,
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>Or dreadful visions in our dreams by night.)
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>The specter seems the Daunian chief to dare,
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>And flourishes his empty sword in air.
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>At this, advancing, Turnus hurl'd his spear:
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>The phantom wheel'd, and seem'd to fly for fear.
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>Deluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled,
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>And with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>"Whether, O coward?" (thus he calls aloud,
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>Nor found he spoke to wind, and chas'd a cloud,)
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>"Why thus forsake your bride! Receive from me
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>The fated land you sought so long by sea."
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>He said, and, brandishing at once his blade,
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>With eager pace pursued the flying shade.
<A NAME="943"></A><BR>By chance a ship was fasten'd to the shore,
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>Which from old Clusium King Osinius bore:
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>The plank was ready laid for safe ascent;
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>For shelter there the trembling shadow bent,
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>And skipp't and skulk'd, and under hatches went.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>Exulting Turnus, with regardless haste,
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>Ascends the plank, and to the galley pass'd.
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>Scarce had he reach'd the prow: Saturnia's hand
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>The haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land.
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>With wind in poop, the vessel plows the sea,
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>And measures back with speed her former way.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>Meantime Aeneas seeks his absent foe,
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>And sends his slaughter'd troops to shades below.
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>The guileful phantom now forsook the shroud,
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>And flew sublime, and vanish'd in a cloud.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>Too late young Turnus the delusion found,
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>Far on the sea, still making from the ground.
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>Then, thankless for a life redeem'd by shame,
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>With sense of honor stung, and forfeit fame,
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>Fearful besides of what in fight had pass'd,
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>His hands and haggard eyes to heav'n he cast;
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>"O Jove!" he cried, "for what offense have
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>Deserv'd to bear this endless infamy?
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>Whence am I forc'd, and whether am I borne?
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>How, and with what reproach, shall I return?
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>Shall ever I behold the Latian plain,
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>Or see Laurentum's lofty tow'rs again?
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>What will they say of their deserting chief
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>The war was mine: I fly from their relief;
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>I led to slaughter, and in slaughter leave;
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>And ev'n from hence their dying groans receive.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>Here, overmatch'd in fight, in heaps they lie;
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>There, scatter'd o'er the fields, ignobly fly.
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>Gape wide, O earth, and draw me down alive!
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>Or, O ye pitying winds, a wretch relieve!
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>On sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive;
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>Or set me shipwrack'd on some desart shore,
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>Where no Rutulian eyes may see me more,
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>Unknown to friends, or foes, or conscious Fame,
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>Lest she should follow, and my flight proclaim."
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>Thus Turnus rav'd, and various fates revolv'd:
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>The choice was doubtful, but the death resolv'd.
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>And now the sword, and now the sea took place,
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>That to revenge, and this to purge disgrace.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>Sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main,
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>By stretch of arms the distant shore to gain.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>Thrice he the sword assay'd, and thrice the flood;
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>But Juno, mov'd with pity, both withstood.
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>And thrice repress'd his rage; strong gales supplied,
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>And push'd the vessel o'er the swelling tide.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>At length she lands him on his native shores,
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>And to his father's longing arms restores.
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>Meantime, by Jove's impulse, Mezentius arm'd,
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>Succeeding Turnus, with his ardor warm'd
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>His fainting friends, reproach'd their shameful 
<A NAME="998"></A>flight,
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>Repell'd the victors, and renew'd the fight.
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>Against their king the Tuscan troops conspire;
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>Such is their hate, and such their fierce desire
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>Of wish'd revenge: on him, and him alone,
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>All hands employ'd, and all their darts are thrown.
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>He, like a solid rock by seas inclos'd,
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>To raging winds and roaring waves oppos'd,
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>From his proud summit looking down, disdains
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>Their empty menace, and unmov'd remains.
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>Beneath his feet fell haughty Hebrus dead,
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>Then Latagus, and Palmus as he fled.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>At Latagus a weighty stone he flung:
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>His face was flatted, and his helmet rung.
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>But Palmus from behind receives his wound;
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>Hamstring'd he falls, and grovels on the ground:
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>His crest and armor, from his body torn,
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>Thy shoulders, Lausus, and thy head adorn.
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>Evas and Mimas, both of Troy, he slew.
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>Mimas his birth from fair Theano drew,
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>Born on that fatal night, when, big with fire,
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>The queen produc'd young Paris to his sire:
<A NAME="1020"></A><BR>But Paris in the Phrygian fields was slain,
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>Unthinking Mimas on the Latian plain.
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>And, as a savage boar, on mountains bred,
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>With forest mast and fatt'ning marshes fed,
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>When once he sees himself in toils inclos'd,
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>By huntsmen and their eager hounds oppos'd-
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>He whets his tusks, and turns, and dares the war;
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>Th' invaders dart their jav'lins from afar:
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>All keep aloof, and safely shout around;
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>But none presumes to give a nearer wound:
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>He frets and froths, erects his bristled hide,
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>And shakes a grove of lances from his side:
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>Not otherwise the troops, with hate inspir'd,
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>And just revenge against the tyrant fir'd,
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>Their darts with clamor at a distance drive,
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>And only keep the languish'd war alive.
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>From Coritus came Acron to the fight,
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>Who left his spouse betroth'd, and unconsummate 
<A NAME="1038"></A>night.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>Mezentius sees him thro' the squadrons ride,
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>Proud of the purple favors of his bride.
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>Then, as a hungry lion, who beholds
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>A gamesome goat, who frisks about the folds,
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>Or beamy stag, that grazes on the plain-
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>He runs, he roars, he shakes his rising mane,
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>He grins, and opens wide his greedy jaws;
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>The prey lies panting underneath his paws:
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>He fills his famish'd maw; his mouth runs o'er
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>With unchew'd morsels, while he churns the gore:
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>So proud Mezentius rushes on his foes,
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>And first unhappy Acron overthrows:
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>Stretch'd at his length, he spurns the swarthy ground;
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>The lance, besmear'd with blood, lies broken in the 
<A NAME="1053"></A>wound.
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>Then with disdain the haughty victor view'd
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>Orodes flying, nor the wretch pursued,
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>Nor thought the dastard's back deserv'd a wound,
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>But, running, gain'd th' advantage of the ground:
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>Then turning short, he met him face to face,
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>To give his victor the better grace.
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>Orodes falls, equal fight oppress'd:
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>Mezentius fix'd his foot upon his breast,
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>And rested lance; and thus aloud he cries:
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>"Lo! here the champion of my rebels lies!"
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>The fields around with Io Paean! ring;
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>And peals of shouts applaud the conqu'ring king.
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>At this the vanquish'd, with his dying breath,
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>Thus faintly spoke, and prophesied in death:
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>"Nor thou, proud man, unpunish'd shalt remain:
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>Like death attends thee on this fatal plain."
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>Then, sourly smiling, thus the king replied:
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>"For what belongs to me, let Jove provide;
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>But die thou first, whatever chance ensue."
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>He said, and from the wound the weapon drew.
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>A hov'ring mist came swimming o'er his sight,
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>And seal'd his eyes in everlasting night.
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>By Caedicus, Alcathous was slain;
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>Sacrator laid Hydaspes on the plain;
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>Orses the strong to greater strength must yield;
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>He, with Parthenius, were by Rapo kill'd.
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>Then brave Messapus Ericetes slew,
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>Who from Lycaon's blood his lineage drew.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>But from his headstrong horse his fate he found,
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>Who threw his master, as he made a bound:
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>The chief, alighting, stuck him to the ground;
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>Then Clonius, hand to hand, on foot assails:
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>The Trojan sinks, and Neptune's son prevails.
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>Agis the Lycian, stepping forth with pride,
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>To single fight the boldest foe defied;
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>Whom Tuscan Valerus by force o'ercame,
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>And not belied his mighty father's fame.
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>Salius to death the great Antronius sent:
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>But the same fate the victor underwent,
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>Slain by Nealces' hand, well-skill'd to throw
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>The flying dart, and draw the far-deceiving bow.
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>Thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance;
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>By turns they quit their ground, by turns advance:
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>Victors and vanquish'd, in the various field,
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>Nor wholly overcome, nor wholly yield.
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>The gods from heav'n survey the fatal strife,
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>And mourn the miseries of human life.
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>Above the rest, two goddesses appear
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>Concern'd for each: here Venus, Juno there.
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>Amidst the crowd, infernal Ate shakes
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>Her scourge aloft, and crest of hissing snakes.
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>Once more the proud Mezentius, with disdain,
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR>Brandish'd his spear, and rush'd into the plain,
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>Where tow'ring in the midmost rank she stood,
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>Like tall Orion stalking o'er the flood.
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>(When with his brawny breast he cuts the waves,
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>His shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves),
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>Or like a mountain ash, whose roots are spread,
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>Deep fix'd in earth; in clouds he hides his head.
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>The Trojan prince beheld him from afar,
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>And dauntless undertook the doubtful war.
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>Collected in his strength, and like a rock,
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>Pois'd on his base, Mezentius stood the shock.
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>He stood, and, measuring first with careful eyes
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>The space his spear could reach, aloud he cries:
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>"My strong right hand, and sword, assist my stroke!
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>(Those only gods Mezentius will invoke.)
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>His armor, from the Trojan pirate torn,
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>By my triumphant Lausus shall be worn."
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>He said; and with his utmost force he threw
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>The massy spear, which, hissing as it flew,
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>Reach'd the celestial shield, that stopp'd the course;
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>But, glancing thence, the yet unbroken force
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>Took a new bent obliquely, and betwixt
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>The side and bowels fam'd Anthores fix'd.
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>Anthores had from Argos travel'd far,
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>Alcides' friend, and brother of the war;
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>Till, tir'd with toils, fair Italy he chose,
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>And in Evander's palace sought repose.
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>Now, falling by another's wound, his eyes
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>He cast to heav'n, on Argos thinks, and dies.
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR>The pious Trojan then his jav'lin sent;
<A NAME="1136"></A><BR>The shield gave way; thro' treble plates it went
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR>Of solid brass, of linen trebly roll'd,
<A NAME="1138"></A><BR>And three bull hides which round the buckler fold.
<A NAME="1139"></A><BR>All these it pass'd, resistless in the course,
<A NAME="1140"></A><BR>Transpierc'd his thigh, and spent its dying force.
<A NAME="1141"></A><BR>The gaping wound gush'd out a crimson flood.
<A NAME="1142"></A><BR>The Trojan, glad with sight of hostile blood,
<A NAME="1143"></A><BR>His faunchion drew, to closer fight address'd,
<A NAME="1144"></A><BR>And with new force his fainting foe oppress'd.
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR>His father's peril Lausus view'd with grief;
<A NAME="1146"></A><BR>He sigh'd, he wept, he ran to his relief.
<A NAME="1147"></A><BR>And here, heroic youth, 't is here I must
<A NAME="1148"></A><BR>To thy immortal memory be just,
<A NAME="1149"></A><BR>And sing an act so noble and so new,
<A NAME="1150"></A><BR>Posterity will scarce believe 't is true.
<A NAME="1151"></A><BR>Pain'd with his wound, and useless for the fight,
<A NAME="1152"></A><BR>The father sought to save himself by flight:
<A NAME="1153"></A><BR>Incumber'd, slow he dragg'd the spear along,
<A NAME="1154"></A><BR>Which pierc'd his thigh, and in his buckler hung.
<A NAME="1155"></A><BR>The pious youth, resolv'd on death, below
<A NAME="1156"></A><BR>The lifted sword springs forth to face the foe;
<A NAME="1157"></A><BR>Protects his parent, and prevents the blow.
<A NAME="1158"></A><BR>Shouts of applause ran ringing thro' the field,
<A NAME="1159"></A><BR>To see the son the vanquish'd father shield.
<A NAME="1160"></A><BR>All, fir'd with gen'rous indignation, strive,
<A NAME="1161"></A><BR>And with a storm of darts to distance drive
<A NAME="1162"></A><BR>The Trojan chief, who, held at bay from far,
<A NAME="1163"></A><BR>On his Vulcanian orb sustain'd the war.
<A NAME="1164"></A><BR>As, when thick hail comes rattling in the wind,
<A NAME="1165"></A><BR>The plowman, passenger, and lab'ring hind
<A NAME="1166"></A><BR>For shelter to the neighb'ring covert fly,
<A NAME="1167"></A><BR>Or hous'd, or safe in hollow caverns lie;
<A NAME="1168"></A><BR>But, that o'erblown, when heav'n above 'em smiles,
<A NAME="1169"></A><BR>Return to travel, and renew their toils:
<A NAME="1170"></A><BR>Aeneas thus, o'erwhelmed on ev'ry side,
<A NAME="1171"></A><BR>The storm of darts, undaunted, did abide;
<A NAME="1172"></A><BR>And thus to Lausus loud with friendly threat'ning 
<A NAME="1173"></A>cried:
<A NAME="1174"></A><BR>"Why wilt thou rush to certain death, and rage
<A NAME="1175"></A><BR>In rash attempts, beyond thy tender age,
<A NAME="1176"></A><BR>Betray'd by pious love?" Nor, thus forborne,
<A NAME="1177"></A><BR>The youth desists, but with insulting scorn
<A NAME="1178"></A><BR>Provokes the ling'ring prince, whose patience, tir'd,
<A NAME="1179"></A><BR>Gave place; and all his breast with fury fir'd.
<A NAME="1180"></A><BR>For now the Fates prepar'd their sharpen'd shears;
<A NAME="1181"></A><BR>And lifted high the flaming sword appears,
<A NAME="1182"></A><BR>Which, full descending with a frightful sway,
<A NAME="1183"></A><BR>Thro' shield and corslet forc'd th' impetuous way,
<A NAME="1184"></A><BR>And buried deep in his fair bosom lay.
<A NAME="1185"></A><BR>The purple streams thro' the thin armor strove,
<A NAME="1186"></A><BR>And drench'd th' imbroider'd coat his mother wove;
<A NAME="1187"></A><BR>And life at length forsook his heaving heart,
<A NAME="1188"></A><BR>Loth from so sweet a mansion to depart.
<A NAME="1189"></A><BR>But when, with blood and paleness all o'erspread,
<A NAME="1190"></A><BR>The pious prince beheld young Lausus dead,
<A NAME="1191"></A><BR>He griev'd; he wept; the sight an image brought
<A NAME="1192"></A><BR>Of his own filial love, a sadly pleasing thought:
<A NAME="1193"></A><BR>Then stretch'd his hand to hold him up, and said:
<A NAME="1194"></A><BR>"Poor hapless youth! what praises can be paid
<A NAME="1195"></A><BR>To love so great, to such transcendent store
<A NAME="1196"></A><BR>Of early worth, and sure presage of more?
<A NAME="1197"></A><BR>Accept whate'er Aeneas can afford;
<A NAME="1198"></A><BR>Untouch'd thy arms, untaken be thy sword;
<A NAME="1199"></A><BR>And all that pleas'd thee living, still remain
<A NAME="1200"></A><BR>Inviolate, and sacred to the slain.
<A NAME="1201"></A><BR>Thy body on thy parents I bestow,
<A NAME="1202"></A><BR>To rest thy soul, at least, if shadows know,
<A NAME="1203"></A><BR>Or have a sense of human things below.
<A NAME="1204"></A><BR>There to thy fellow ghosts with glory tell:
<A NAME="1205"></A><BR>''T was by the great Aeneas hand I fell.'"
<A NAME="1206"></A><BR>With this, his distant friends he beckons near,
<A NAME="1207"></A><BR>Provokes their duty, and prevents their fear:
<A NAME="1208"></A><BR>Himself assists to lift him from the ground,
<A NAME="1209"></A><BR>With clotted locks, and blood that well'd from out the 
<A NAME="1210"></A>wound.
<A NAME="1211"></A><BR>Meantime, his father, now no father, stood,
<A NAME="1212"></A><BR>And wash'd his wounds by Tiber's yellow flood:
<A NAME="1213"></A><BR>Oppress'd with anguish, panting, and o'erspent,
<A NAME="1214"></A><BR>His fainting limbs against an oak he leant.
<A NAME="1215"></A><BR>A bough his brazen helmet did sustain;
<A NAME="1216"></A><BR>His heavier arms lay scatter'd on the plain:
<A NAME="1217"></A><BR>A chosen train of youth around him stand;
<A NAME="1218"></A><BR>His drooping head was rested on his hand:
<A NAME="1219"></A><BR>His grisly beard his pensive bosom sought;
<A NAME="1220"></A><BR>And all on Lausus ran his restless thought.
<A NAME="1221"></A><BR>Careful, concern'd his danger to prevent,
<A NAME="1222"></A><BR>He much enquir'd, and many a message sent
<A NAME="1223"></A><BR>To warn him from the field- alas! in vain!
<A NAME="1224"></A><BR>Behold, his mournful followers bear him slain!
<A NAME="1225"></A><BR>O'er his broad shield still gush'd the yawning wound,
<A NAME="1226"></A><BR>And drew a bloody trail along the ground.
<A NAME="1227"></A><BR>Far off he heard their cries, far off divin'd
<A NAME="1228"></A><BR>The dire event, with a foreboding mind.
<A NAME="1229"></A><BR>With dust he sprinkled first his hoary head;
<A NAME="1230"></A><BR>Then both his lifted hands to heav'n he spread;
<A NAME="1231"></A><BR>Last, the dear corpse embracing, thus he said:
<A NAME="1232"></A><BR>"What joys, alas! could this frail being give,
<A NAME="1233"></A><BR>That I have been so covetous to live?
<A NAME="1234"></A><BR>To see my son, and such a son, resign
<A NAME="1235"></A><BR>His life, a ransom for preserving mine!
<A NAME="1236"></A><BR>And am I then preserv'd, and art thou lost?
<A NAME="1237"></A><BR>How much too dear has that redemption cost!
<A NAME="1238"></A><BR>'T is now my bitter banishment I feel:
<A NAME="1239"></A><BR>This is a wound too deep for time to heal.
<A NAME="1240"></A><BR>My guilt thy growing virtues did defame;
<A NAME="1241"></A><BR>My blackness blotted thy unblemish'd name.
<A NAME="1242"></A><BR>Chas'd from a throne, abandon'd, and exil'd
<A NAME="1243"></A><BR>For foul misdeeds, were punishments too mild:
<A NAME="1244"></A><BR>I ow'd my people these, and, from their hate,
<A NAME="1245"></A><BR>With less resentment could have borne my fate.
<A NAME="1246"></A><BR>And yet I live, and yet sustain the sight
<A NAME="1247"></A><BR>Of hated men, and of more hated light:
<A NAME="1248"></A><BR>But will not long." With that he rais'd from ground
<A NAME="1249"></A><BR>His fainting limbs, that stagger'd with his wound;
<A NAME="1250"></A><BR>Yet, with a mind resolv'd, and unappall'd
<A NAME="1251"></A><BR>With pains or perils, for his courser call'd
<A NAME="1252"></A><BR>Well-mouth'd, well-manag'd, whom himself did dress
<A NAME="1253"></A><BR>With daily care, and mounted with success;
<A NAME="1254"></A><BR>His aid in arms, his ornament in peace.
<A NAME="1255"></A><BR>Soothing his courage with a gentle stroke,
<A NAME="1256"></A><BR>The steed seem'd sensible, while thus he spoke:
<A NAME="1257"></A><BR>"O Rhoebus, we have liv'd too long for me-
<A NAME="1258"></A><BR>If life and long were terms that could agree!
<A NAME="1259"></A><BR>This day thou either shalt bring back the head
<A NAME="1260"></A><BR>And bloody trophies of the Trojan dead;
<A NAME="1261"></A><BR>This day thou either shalt revenge my woe,
<A NAME="1262"></A><BR>For murther'd Lausus, on his cruel foe;
<A NAME="1263"></A><BR>Or, if inexorable fate deny
<A NAME="1264"></A><BR>Our conquest, with thy conquer'd master die:
<A NAME="1265"></A><BR>For, after such a lord, rest secure,
<A NAME="1266"></A><BR>Thou wilt no foreign reins, or Trojan load endure."
<A NAME="1267"></A><BR>He said; and straight th' officious courser kneels,
<A NAME="1268"></A><BR>To take his wonted weight. His hands he fills
<A NAME="1269"></A><BR>With pointed jav'lins; on his head he lac'd
<A NAME="1270"></A><BR>His glitt'ring helm, which terribly was grac'd
<A NAME="1271"></A><BR>With waving horsehair, nodding from afar;
<A NAME="1272"></A><BR>Then spurr'd his thund'ring steed amidst the war.
<A NAME="1273"></A><BR>Love, anguish, wrath, and grief, to madness wrought,
<A NAME="1274"></A><BR>Despair, and secret shame, and conscious thought
<A NAME="1275"></A><BR>Of inborn worth, his lab'ring soul oppress'd,
<A NAME="1276"></A><BR>Roll'd in his eyes, and rag'd within his breast.
<A NAME="1277"></A><BR>Then loud he call'd Aeneas thrice by name:
<A NAME="1278"></A><BR>The loud repeated voice to glad Aeneas came.
<A NAME="1279"></A><BR>"Great Jove," he said, "and the far-shooting god,
<A NAME="1280"></A><BR>Inspire thy mind to make thy challenge good!"
<A NAME="1281"></A><BR>He spoke no more; but hasten'd, void of fear,
<A NAME="1282"></A><BR>And threaten'd with his long protended spear.
<A NAME="1283"></A><BR>To whom Mezentius thus: "Thy vaunts are vain.
<A NAME="1284"></A><BR>My Lausus lies extended on the plain:
<A NAME="1285"></A><BR>He's lost! thy conquest is already won;
<A NAME="1286"></A><BR>The wretched sire is murther'd in the son.
<A NAME="1287"></A><BR>Nor fate I fear, but all the gods defy.
<A NAME="1288"></A><BR>Forbear thy threats: my bus'ness is to die;
<A NAME="1289"></A><BR>But first receive this parting legacy."
<A NAME="1290"></A><BR>He said; and straight a whirling dart he sent;
<A NAME="1291"></A><BR>Another after, and another went.
<A NAME="1292"></A><BR>Round in a spacious ring he rides the field,
<A NAME="1293"></A><BR>And vainly plies th' impenetrable shield.
<A NAME="1294"></A><BR>Thrice rode he round; and thrice Aeneas wheel'd,
<A NAME="1295"></A><BR>Turn'd as he turn'd: the golden orb withstood
<A NAME="1296"></A><BR>The strokes, and bore about an iron wood.
<A NAME="1297"></A><BR>Impatient of delay, and weary grown,
<A NAME="1298"></A><BR>Still to defend, and to defend alone,
<A NAME="1299"></A><BR>To wrench the darts which in his buckler light,
<A NAME="1300"></A><BR>Urg'd and o'er-labor'd in unequal fight;
<A NAME="1301"></A><BR>At length resolv'd, he throws with all his force
<A NAME="1302"></A><BR>Full at the temples of the warrior horse.
<A NAME="1303"></A><BR>Just where the stroke was aim'd, th' unerring spear
<A NAME="1304"></A><BR>Made way, and stood transfix'd thro' either ear.
<A NAME="1305"></A><BR>Seiz'd with unwonted pain, surpris'd with fright,
<A NAME="1306"></A><BR>The wounded steed curvets, and, rais'd upright,
<A NAME="1307"></A><BR>Lights on his feet before; his hoofs behind
<A NAME="1308"></A><BR>Spring up in air aloft, and lash the wind.
<A NAME="1309"></A><BR>Down comes the rider headlong from his height:
<A NAME="1310"></A><BR>His horse came after with unwieldy weight,
<A NAME="1311"></A><BR>And, flound'ring forward, pitching on his head,
<A NAME="1312"></A><BR>His lord's incumber'd shoulder overlaid.
<A NAME="1313"></A><BR>From either host, the mingled shouts and cries
<A NAME="1314"></A><BR>Of Trojans and Rutulians rend the skies.
<A NAME="1315"></A><BR>Aeneas, hast'ning, wav'd his fatal sword
<A NAME="1316"></A><BR>High o'er his head, with this reproachful word:
<A NAME="1317"></A><BR>"Now; where are now thy vaunts, the fierce disdain
<A NAME="1318"></A><BR>Of proud Mezentius, and the lofty strain?"
<A NAME="1319"></A><BR>Struggling, and wildly staring on the skies,
<A NAME="1320"></A><BR>With scarce recover'd sight he thus replies:
<A NAME="1321"></A><BR>"Why these insulting words, this waste of breath,
<A NAME="1322"></A><BR>To souls undaunted, and secure of death?
<A NAME="1323"></A><BR>'T is no dishonor for the brave to die,
<A NAME="1324"></A><BR>Nor came I here with hope victory;
<A NAME="1325"></A><BR>Nor ask I life, nor fought with that design:
<A NAME="1326"></A><BR>As I had us'd my fortune, use thou thine.
<A NAME="1327"></A><BR>My dying son contracted no such band;
<A NAME="1328"></A><BR>The gift is hateful from his murd'rer's hand.
<A NAME="1329"></A><BR>For this, this only favor let me sue,
<A NAME="1330"></A><BR>If pity can to conquer'd foes be due:
<A NAME="1331"></A><BR>Refuse it not; but let my body have
<A NAME="1332"></A><BR>The last retreat of humankind, a grave.
<A NAME="1333"></A><BR>Too well I know th' insulting people's hate;
<A NAME="1334"></A><BR>Protect me from their vengeance after fate:
<A NAME="1335"></A><BR>This refuge for my poor remains provide,
<A NAME="1336"></A><BR>And lay my much-lov'd Lausus by my side."
<A NAME="1337"></A><BR>He said, and to the sword his throat applied.
<A NAME="1338"></A><BR>The crimson stream distain'd his arms around,
<A NAME="1339"></A><BR>And the disdainful soul came rushing thro' the wound.
