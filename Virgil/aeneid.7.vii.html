<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>And thou, O matron of immortal fame,
<A NAME="11"></A><BR>Here dying, to the shore hast left thy name;
<A NAME="12"></A><BR>Cajeta still the place is call'd from thee,
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>The nurse of great Aeneas' infancy.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR>Here rest thy bones in rich Hesperia's plains;
<A NAME="15"></A><BR>Thy name ('t is all a ghost can have) remains.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR>Now, when the prince her fun'ral rites had paid,
<A NAME="17"></A><BR>He plow'd the Tyrrhene seas with sails display'd.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>From land a gentle breeze arose by night,
<A NAME="19"></A><BR>Serenely shone the stars, the moon was bright,
<A NAME="20"></A><BR>And the sea trembled with her silver light.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR>Now near the shelves of Circe's shores they run,
<A NAME="22"></A><BR>(Circe the rich, the daughter of the Sun,)
<A NAME="23"></A><BR>A dang'rous coast: the goddess wastes her days
<A NAME="24"></A><BR>In joyous songs; the rocks resound her lays:
<A NAME="25"></A><BR>In spinning, or the loom, she spends the night,
<A NAME="26"></A><BR>And cedar brands supply her father's light.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR>From hence were heard, rebellowing to the main,
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>The roars of lions that refuse the chain,
<A NAME="29"></A><BR>The grunts of bristled boars, and groans of bears,
<A NAME="30"></A><BR>And herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors' 
<A NAME="31"></A>ears.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR>These from their caverns, at the close of night,
<A NAME="33"></A><BR>Fill the sad isle with horror and affright.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR>Darkling they mourn their fate, whom Circe's pow'r,
<A NAME="35"></A><BR>(That watch'd the moon and planetary hour,)
<A NAME="36"></A><BR>With words and wicked herbs from humankind
<A NAME="37"></A><BR>Had alter'd, and in brutal shapes confin'd.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR>Which monsters lest the Trojans' pious host
<A NAME="39"></A><BR>Should bear, or touch upon th' inchanted coast,
<A NAME="40"></A><BR>Propitious Neptune steer'd their course by night
<A NAME="41"></A><BR>With rising gales that sped their happy flight.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR>Supplied with these, they skim the sounding shore,
<A NAME="43"></A><BR>And hear the swelling surges vainly roar.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR>Now, when the rosy morn began to rise,
<A NAME="45"></A><BR>And wav'd her saffron streamer thro' the skies;
<A NAME="46"></A><BR>When Thetis blush'd in purple not her own,
<A NAME="47"></A><BR>And from her face the breathing winds were blown,
<A NAME="48"></A><BR>A sudden silence sate upon the sea,
<A NAME="49"></A><BR>And sweeping oars, with struggling, urge their way.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>The Trojan, from the main, beheld a wood,
<A NAME="51"></A><BR>Which thick with shades and a brown horror stood:
<A NAME="52"></A><BR>Betwixt the trees the Tiber took his course,
<A NAME="53"></A><BR>With whirlpools dimpled; and with downward force,
<A NAME="54"></A><BR>That drove the sand along, he took his way,
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>And roll'd his yellow billows to the sea.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>About him, and above, and round the wood,
<A NAME="57"></A><BR>The birds that haunt the borders of his flood,
<A NAME="58"></A><BR>That bath'd within, or basked upon his side,
<A NAME="59"></A><BR>To tuneful songs their narrow throats applied.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR>The captain gives command; the joyful train
<A NAME="61"></A><BR>Glide thro' the gloomy shade, and leave the main.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR>Now, Erato, thy poet's mind inspire,
<A NAME="63"></A><BR>And fill his soul with thy celestial fire!
<A NAME="64"></A><BR>Relate what Latium was; her ancient kings;
<A NAME="65"></A><BR>Declare the past and state of things,
<A NAME="66"></A><BR>When first the Trojan fleet Ausonia sought,
<A NAME="67"></A><BR>And how the rivals lov'd, and how they fought.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>These are my theme, and how the war began,
<A NAME="69"></A><BR>And how concluded by the godlike man:
<A NAME="70"></A><BR>For I shall sing of battles, blood, and rage,
<A NAME="71"></A><BR>Which princes and their people did engage;
<A NAME="72"></A><BR>And haughty souls, that, mov'd with mutual hate,
<A NAME="73"></A><BR>In fighting fields pursued and found their fate;
<A NAME="74"></A><BR>That rous'd the Tyrrhene realm with loud alarms,
<A NAME="75"></A><BR>And peaceful Italy involv'd in arms.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR>A larger scene of action is display'd;
<A NAME="77"></A><BR>And, rising hence, a greater work is weigh'd.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR>Latinus, old and mild, had long possess'd
<A NAME="79"></A><BR>The Latin scepter, and his people blest:
<A NAME="80"></A><BR>His father Faunus; a Laurentian dame
<A NAME="81"></A><BR>His mother; fair Marica was her name.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR>But Faunus came from Picus: Picus drew
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>His birth from Saturn, if records be true.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR>Thus King Latinus, in the third degree,
<A NAME="85"></A><BR>Had Saturn author of his family.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR>But this old peaceful prince, as Heav'n decreed,
<A NAME="87"></A><BR>Was blest with no male issue to succeed:
<A NAME="88"></A><BR>His sons in blooming youth were snatch'd by fate;
<A NAME="89"></A><BR>One only daughter heir'd the royal state.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR>Fir'd with her love, and with ambition led,
<A NAME="91"></A><BR>The neighb'ring princes court her nuptial bed.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR>Among the crowd, but far above the rest,
<A NAME="93"></A><BR>Young Turnus to the beauteous maid address'd.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR>Turnus, for high descent and graceful mien,
<A NAME="95"></A><BR>Was first, and favor'd by the Latian queen;
<A NAME="96"></A><BR>With him she strove to join Lavinia's hand,
<A NAME="97"></A><BR>But dire portents the purpos'd match withstand.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR>Deep in the palace, of long growth, there stood
<A NAME="99"></A><BR>A laurel's trunk, a venerable wood;
<A NAME="100"></A><BR>Where rites divine were paid; whose holy hair
<A NAME="101"></A><BR>Was kept and cut with superstitious care.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR>This plant Latinus, when his town he wall'd,
<A NAME="103"></A><BR>Then found, and from the tree Laurentum call'd;
<A NAME="104"></A><BR>And last, in honor of his new abode,
<A NAME="105"></A><BR>He vow'd the laurel to the laurel's god.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR>It happen'd once (a boding prodigy!)
<A NAME="107"></A><BR>A swarm of bees, that cut the liquid sky,
<A NAME="108"></A><BR>(Unknown from whence they took their airy flight,)
<A NAME="109"></A><BR>Upon the topmost branch in clouds alight;
<A NAME="110"></A><BR>There with their clasping feet together clung,
<A NAME="111"></A><BR>And a long cluster from the laurel hung.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR>An ancient augur prophesied from hence:
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>"Behold on Latian shores a foreign prince!
<A NAME="114"></A><BR>From the same parts of heav'n his navy stands,
<A NAME="115"></A><BR>To the same parts on earth; his army lands;
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>The town he conquers, and the tow'r commands."
<A NAME="117"></A><BR>Yet more, when fair Lavinia fed the fire
<A NAME="118"></A><BR>Before the gods, and stood beside her sire,
<A NAME="119"></A><BR>(Strange to relate!) the flames, involv'd in smoke
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>Of incense, from the sacred altar broke,
<A NAME="121"></A><BR>Caught her dishevel'd hair and rich attire;
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Her crown and jewels crackled in the fire:
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>From thence the fuming trail began to spread
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>And lambent glories danc'd about her head.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>This new portent the seer with wonder views,
<A NAME="126"></A><BR>Then pausing, thus his prophecy renews:
<A NAME="127"></A><BR>"The nymph, who scatters flaming fires around,
<A NAME="128"></A><BR>Shall shine with honor, shall herself be crown'd;
<A NAME="129"></A><BR>But, caus'd by her irrevocable fate,
<A NAME="130"></A><BR>War shall the country waste, and change the state."
<A NAME="131"></A><BR>Latinus, frighted with this dire ostent,
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>For counsel to his father Faunus went,
<A NAME="133"></A><BR>And sought the shades renown'd for prophecy
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Which near Albunea's sulph'rous fountain lie.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR>To these the Latian and the Sabine land
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Fly, when distress'd, and thence relief demand.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR>The priest on skins of off'rings takes his ease,
<A NAME="138"></A><BR>And nightly visions in his slumber sees;
<A NAME="139"></A><BR>A swarm of thin aerial shapes appears,
<A NAME="140"></A><BR>And, flutt'ring round his temples, deafs his ears:
<A NAME="141"></A><BR>These he consults, the future fates to know,
<A NAME="142"></A><BR>From pow'rs above, and from the fiends below.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR>Here, for the gods' advice, Latinus flies,
<A NAME="144"></A><BR>Off'ring a hundred sheep for sacrifice:
<A NAME="145"></A><BR>Their woolly fleeces, as the rites requir'd,
<A NAME="146"></A><BR>He laid beneath him, and to rest retir'd.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR>No sooner were his eyes in slumber bound,
<A NAME="148"></A><BR>When, from above, a more than mortal sound
<A NAME="149"></A><BR>Invades his ears; and thus the vision spoke:
<A NAME="150"></A><BR>"Seek not, my seed, in Latian bands to yoke
<A NAME="151"></A><BR>Our fair Lavinia, nor the gods provoke.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR>A foreign son upon thy shore descends,
<A NAME="153"></A><BR>Whose martial fame from pole to pole extends.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR>His race, in arms and arts of peace renown'd,
<A NAME="155"></A><BR>Not Latium shall contain, nor Europe bound:
<A NAME="156"></A><BR>'T is theirs whate'er the sun surveys around."
<A NAME="157"></A><BR>These answers, in the silent night receiv'd,
<A NAME="158"></A><BR>The king himself divulg'd, the land believ'd:
<A NAME="159"></A><BR>The fame thro' all the neighb'ring nations flew,
<A NAME="160"></A><BR>When now the Trojan navy was in view.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR>Beneath a shady tree, the hero spread
<A NAME="162"></A><BR>His table on the turf, with cakes of bread;
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>And, with his chiefs, on forest fruits he fed.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR>They sate; and, (not without the god's command,)
<A NAME="165"></A><BR>Their homely fare dispatch'd, the hungry band
<A NAME="166"></A><BR>Invade their trenchers next, and soon devour,
<A NAME="167"></A><BR>To mend the scanty meal, their cakes of flour.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR>Ascanius this observ'd, and smiling said:
<A NAME="169"></A><BR>"See, we devour the plates on which we fed."
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>The speech had omen, that the Trojan race
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>Should find repose, and this the time and place.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>Aeneas took the word, and thus replies,
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>Confessing fate with wonder in his eyes:
<A NAME="174"></A><BR>"All hail, O earth! all hail, my household gods!
<A NAME="175"></A><BR>Behold the destin'd place of your abodes!
<A NAME="176"></A><BR>For thus Anchises prophesied of old,
<A NAME="177"></A><BR>And this our fatal place of rest foretold:
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>'When, on a foreign shore, instead of meat,
<A NAME="179"></A><BR>By famine forc'd, your trenchers you shall eat,
<A NAME="180"></A><BR>Then ease your weary Trojans will attend,
<A NAME="181"></A><BR>And the long labors of your voyage end.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR>Remember on that happy coast to build,
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>And with a trench inclose the fruitful field.'
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>This was that famine, this the fatal place
<A NAME="185"></A><BR>Which ends the wand'ring of our exil'd race.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>Then, on to-morrow's dawn, your care employ,
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>To search the land, and where the cities lie,
<A NAME="188"></A><BR>And what the men; but give this day to joy.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR>Now pour to Jove; and, after Jove is blest,
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>Call great Anchises to the genial feast:
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>Crown high the goblets with a cheerful draught;
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>Enjoy the present hour; adjourn the future thought."
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Thus having said, the hero bound his brows
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>With leafy branches, then perform'd his vows;
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>Adoring first the genius of the place,
<A NAME="196"></A><BR>Then Earth, the mother of the heav'nly race,
<A NAME="197"></A><BR>The nymphs, and native godheads yet unknown,
<A NAME="198"></A><BR>And Night, and all the stars that gild her sable 
<A NAME="199"></A>throne,
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>And ancient Cybel, and Idaean Jove,
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>And last his sire below, and mother queen above.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>Then heav'n's high monarch thunder'd thrice aloud,
<A NAME="203"></A><BR>And thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>Soon thro' the joyful camp a rumor flew,
<A NAME="205"></A><BR>The time was come their city to renew.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>Then ev'ry brow with cheerful green is crown'd,
<A NAME="207"></A><BR>The feasts are doubled, and the bowls go round.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>When next the rosy morn disclos'd the day,
<A NAME="209"></A><BR>The scouts to sev'ral parts divide their way,
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>To learn the natives' names, their towns explore,
<A NAME="211"></A><BR>The coasts and trendings of the crooked shore:
<A NAME="212"></A><BR>Here Tiber flows, and here Numicus stands;
<A NAME="213"></A><BR>Here warlike Latins hold the happy lands.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR>The pious chief, who sought by peaceful ways
<A NAME="215"></A><BR>To found his empire, and his town to raise,
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>A hundred youths from all his train selects,
<A NAME="217"></A><BR>And to the Latian court their course directs,
<A NAME="218"></A><BR>(The spacious palace where their prince resides,)
<A NAME="219"></A><BR>And all their heads with wreaths of olive hides.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>They go commission'd to require a peace,
<A NAME="221"></A><BR>And carry presents to procure access.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR>Thus while they speed their pace, the prince designs
<A NAME="223"></A><BR>His new-elected seat, and draws the lines.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR>The Trojans round the place a rampire cast,
<A NAME="225"></A><BR>And palisades about the trenches plac'd.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR>Meantime the train, proceeding on their way,
<A NAME="227"></A><BR>From far the town and lofty tow'rs survey;
<A NAME="228"></A><BR>At length approach the walls. Without the gate,
<A NAME="229"></A><BR>They see the boys and Latian youth debate
<A NAME="230"></A><BR>The martial prizes on the dusty plain:
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>Some drive the cars, and some the coursers rein;
<A NAME="232"></A><BR>Some bend the stubborn bow for victory,
<A NAME="233"></A><BR>And some with darts their active sinews try.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR>A posting messenger, dispatch'd from hence,
<A NAME="235"></A><BR>Of this fair troop advis'd their aged prince,
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>That foreign men of mighty stature came;
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>Uncouth their habit, and unknown their name.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR>The king ordains their entrance, and ascends
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>His regal seat, surrounded by his friends.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR>The palace built by Picus, vast and proud,
<A NAME="241"></A><BR>Supported by a hundred pillars stood,
<A NAME="242"></A><BR>And round incompass'd with a rising wood.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR>The pile o'erlook'd the town, and drew the sight;
<A NAME="244"></A><BR>Surpris'd at once with reverence and delight.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>There kings receiv'd the marks of sov'reign pow'r;
<A NAME="246"></A><BR>In state the monarchs march'd; the lictors bore
<A NAME="247"></A><BR>Their awful axes and the rods before.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR>Here the tribunal stood, the house of pray'r,
<A NAME="249"></A><BR>And here the sacred senators repair;
<A NAME="250"></A><BR>All at large tables, in long order set,
<A NAME="251"></A><BR>A ram their off'ring, and a ram their meat.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR>Above the portal, carv'd in cedar wood,
<A NAME="253"></A><BR>Plac'd in their ranks, their godlike grandsires 
<A NAME="254"></A>stood;
<A NAME="255"></A><BR>Old Saturn, with his crooked scythe, on high;
<A NAME="256"></A><BR>And Italus, that led the colony;
<A NAME="257"></A><BR>And ancient Janus, with his double face,
<A NAME="258"></A><BR>And bunch of keys, the porter of the place.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR>There good Sabinus, planter of the vines,
<A NAME="260"></A><BR>On a short pruning hook his head reclines,
<A NAME="261"></A><BR>And studiously surveys his gen'rous wines;
<A NAME="262"></A><BR>Then warlike kings, who for their country fought,
<A NAME="263"></A><BR>And honorable wounds from battle brought.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR>Around the posts hung helmets, darts, and spears,
<A NAME="265"></A><BR>And captive chariots, axes, shields, and bars,
<A NAME="266"></A><BR>And broken beaks of ships, the trophies of their 
<A NAME="267"></A>wars.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR>Above the rest, as chief of all the band,
<A NAME="269"></A><BR>Was Picus plac'd, a buckler in his hand;
<A NAME="270"></A><BR>His other wav'd a long divining wand.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR>Girt in his Gabin gown the hero sate,
<A NAME="272"></A><BR>Yet could not with his art avoid his fate:
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>For Circe long had lov'd the youth in vain,
<A NAME="274"></A><BR>Till love, refus'd, converted to disdain:
<A NAME="275"></A><BR>Then, mixing pow'rful herbs, with magic art,
<A NAME="276"></A><BR>She chang'd his form, who could not change his heart;
<A NAME="277"></A><BR>Constrain'd him in a bird, and made him fly,
<A NAME="278"></A><BR>With party-color'd plumes, a chatt'ring pie.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR>In this high temple, on a chair of state,
<A NAME="280"></A><BR>The seat of audience, old Latinus sate;
<A NAME="281"></A><BR>Then gave admission to the Trojan train;
<A NAME="282"></A><BR>And thus with pleasing accents he began:
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>"Tell me, ye Trojans, for that name you own,
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Nor is your course upon our coasts unknown-
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>Say what you seek, and whither were you bound:
<A NAME="286"></A><BR>Were you by stress of weather cast aground?
<A NAME="287"></A><BR>(Such dangers as on seas are often seen,
<A NAME="288"></A><BR>And oft befall to miserable men,)
<A NAME="289"></A><BR>Or come, your shipping in our ports to lay,
<A NAME="290"></A><BR>Spent and disabled in so long a way?
<A NAME="291"></A><BR>Say what you want: the Latians you shall find
<A NAME="292"></A><BR>Not forc'd to goodness, but by will inclin'd;
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>For, since the time of Saturn's holy reign,
<A NAME="294"></A><BR>His hospitable customs we retain.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>I call to mind (but time the tale has worn)
<A NAME="296"></A><BR>Th' Arunci told, that Dardanus, tho' born
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>On Latian plains, yet sought the Phrygian shore,
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>And Samothracia, Samos call'd before.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR>From Tuscan Coritum he claim'd his birth;
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>But after, when exempt from mortal earth,
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>From thence ascended to his kindred skies,
<A NAME="302"></A><BR>A god, and, as a god, augments their sacrifice,"
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>He said. Ilioneus made this reply:
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>"O king, of Faunus' royal family!
<A NAME="305"></A><BR>Nor wintry winds to Latium forc'd our way,
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>Nor did the stars our wand'ring course betray.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>Willing we sought your shores; and, hither bound,
<A NAME="308"></A><BR>The port, so long desir'd, at length we found;
<A NAME="309"></A><BR>From our sweet homes and ancient realms expell'd;
<A NAME="310"></A><BR>Great as the greatest that the sun beheld.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR>The god began our line, who rules above;
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>And, as our race, our king descends from Jove:
<A NAME="313"></A><BR>And hither are we come, by his command,
<A NAME="314"></A><BR>To crave admission in your happy land.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR>How dire a tempest, from Mycenae pour'd,
<A NAME="316"></A><BR>Our plains, our temples, and our town devour'd;
<A NAME="317"></A><BR>What was the waste of war, what fierce alarms
<A NAME="318"></A><BR>Shook Asia's crown with European arms;
<A NAME="319"></A><BR>Ev'n such have heard, if any such there be,
<A NAME="320"></A><BR>Whose earth is bounded by the frozen sea;
<A NAME="321"></A><BR>And such as, born beneath the burning sky
<A NAME="322"></A><BR>And sultry sun, betwixt the tropics lie.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR>From that dire deluge, thro' the wat'ry waste,
<A NAME="324"></A><BR>Such length of years, such various perils past,
<A NAME="325"></A><BR>At last escap'd, to Latium we repair,
<A NAME="326"></A><BR>To beg what you without your want may spare:
<A NAME="327"></A><BR>The common water, and the common air;
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>Sheds which ourselves will build, and mean abodes,
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Fit to receive and serve our banish'd gods.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>Nor our admission shall your realm disgrace,
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Nor length of time our gratitude efface.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR>Besides, what endless honor you shall gain,
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>To save and shelter Troy's unhappy train!
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>Now, by my sov'reign, and his fate, I swear,
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>Renown'd for faith in peace, for force in war;
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>Oft our alliance other lands desir'd,
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>And, what we seek of you, of us requir'd.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Despite not then, that in our hands we bear
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>These holy boughs, sue with words of pray'r.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>Fate and the gods, by their supreme command,
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>Have doom'd our ships to seek the Latian land.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>To these abodes our fleet Apollo sends;
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Here Dardanus was born, and hither tends;
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Where Tuscan Tiber rolls with rapid force,
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>And where Numicus opes his holy source.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>Besides, our prince presents, with his request,
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>Some small remains of what his sire possess'd.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>This golden charger, snatch'd from burning Troy,
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>Anchises did in sacrifice employ;
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>This royal robe and this tiara wore
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>Old Priam, and this golden scepter bore
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>In full assemblies, and in solemn games;
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>These purple vests were weav'd by Dardan dames."
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>Thus while he spoke, Latinus roll'd around
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>His eyes, and fix'd a while upon the ground.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR>Intent he seem'd, and anxious in his breast;
<A NAME="357"></A><BR>Not by the scepter mov'd, or kingly vest,
<A NAME="358"></A><BR>But pond'ring future things of wondrous weight;
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Succession, empire, and his daughter's fate.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>On these he mus'd within his thoughtful mind,
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>And then revolv'd what Faunus had divin'd.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>This was the foreign prince, by fate decreed
<A NAME="363"></A><BR>To share his scepter, and Lavinia's bed;
<A NAME="364"></A><BR>This was the race that sure portents foreshew
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>To sway the world, and land and sea subdue.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>At length he rais'd his cheerful head, and spoke:
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>"The pow'rs," said he, "the pow'rs we both invoke,
<A NAME="368"></A><BR>To you, and yours, and mine, propitious be,
<A NAME="369"></A><BR>And firm our purpose with their augury!
<A NAME="370"></A><BR>Have what you ask; your presents I receive;
<A NAME="371"></A><BR>Land, where and when you please, with ample leave;
<A NAME="372"></A><BR>Partake and use my kingdom as your own;
<A NAME="373"></A><BR>All shall be yours, while I command the crown:
<A NAME="374"></A><BR>And, if my wish'd alliance please your king,
<A NAME="375"></A><BR>Tell him he should not send the peace, but bring.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR>Then let him not a friend's embraces fear;
<A NAME="377"></A><BR>The peace is made when I behold him here.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR>Besides this answer, tell my royal guest,
<A NAME="379"></A><BR>I add to his commands my own request:
<A NAME="380"></A><BR>One only daughter heirs my crown and state,
<A NAME="381"></A><BR>Whom not our oracles, nor Heav'n, nor fate,
<A NAME="382"></A><BR>Nor frequent prodigies, permit to join
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>With any native of th' Ausonian line.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR>A foreign son-in-law shall come from far
<A NAME="385"></A><BR>(Such is our doom), a chief renown'd in war,
<A NAME="386"></A><BR>Whose race shall bear aloft the Latian name,
<A NAME="387"></A><BR>And thro' the conquer'd world diffuse our fame.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR>Himself to be the man the fates require,
<A NAME="389"></A><BR>I firmly judge, and, what I judge, desire."
<A NAME="390"></A><BR>He said, and then on each bestow'd a steed.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR>Three hundred horses, in high stables fed,
<A NAME="392"></A><BR>Stood ready, shining all, and smoothly dress'd:
<A NAME="393"></A><BR>Of these he chose the fairest and the best,
<A NAME="394"></A><BR>To mount the Trojan troop. At his command
<A NAME="395"></A><BR>The steeds caparison'd with purple stand,
<A NAME="396"></A><BR>With golden trappings, glorious to behold,
<A NAME="397"></A><BR>And champ betwixt their teeth the foaming gold.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR>Then to his absent guest the king decreed
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>A pair of coursers born of heav'nly breed,
<A NAME="400"></A><BR>Who from their nostrils breath'd ethereal fire;
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>Whom Circe stole from her celestial sire,
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>By substituting mares produc'd on earth,
<A NAME="403"></A><BR>Whose wombs conceiv'd a more than mortal birth.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR>These draw the chariot which Latinus sends,
<A NAME="405"></A><BR>And the rich present to the prince commends.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>Sublime on stately steeds the Trojans borne,
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>To their expecting lord with peace return.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR>But jealous Juno, from Pachynus' height,
<A NAME="409"></A><BR>As she from Argos took her airy flight,
<A NAME="410"></A><BR>Beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR>She saw the Trojan and his joyful train
<A NAME="412"></A><BR>Descend upon the shore, desert the main,
<A NAME="413"></A><BR>Design a town, and, with unhop'd success,
<A NAME="414"></A><BR>Th' embassadors return with promis'd peace.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR>Then, pierc'd with pain, she shook her haughty head,
<A NAME="416"></A><BR>Sigh'd from her inward soul, and thus she said:
<A NAME="417"></A><BR>"O hated offspring of my Phrygian foes!
<A NAME="418"></A><BR>O fates of Troy, which Juno's fates oppose!
<A NAME="419"></A><BR>Could they not fall unpitied on the plain,
<A NAME="420"></A><BR>But slain revive, and, taken, scape again?
<A NAME="421"></A><BR>When execrable Troy in ashes lay,
<A NAME="422"></A><BR>Thro' fires and swords and seas they forc'd their 
<A NAME="423"></A>way.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR>Then vanquish'd Juno must in vain contend,
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Her rage disarm'd, her empire at an end.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR>Breathless and tir'd, is all my fury spent?
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Or does my glutted spleen at length relent?
<A NAME="428"></A><BR>As if 't were little from their town to chase,
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>I thro' the seas pursued their exil'd race;
<A NAME="430"></A><BR>Ingag'd the heav'ns, oppos'd the stormy main;
<A NAME="431"></A><BR>But billows roar'd, and tempests rag'd in vain.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done,
<A NAME="433"></A><BR>When these they overpass, and those they shun?
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>On Tiber's shores they land, secure of fate,
<A NAME="435"></A><BR>Triumphant o'er the storms and Juno's hate.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe,
<A NAME="437"></A><BR>And Jove himself gave way to Cynthia's wrath,
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon;
<A NAME="439"></A><BR>(What great offense had either people done?)
<A NAME="440"></A><BR>But I, the consort of the Thunderer,
<A NAME="441"></A><BR>Have wag'd a long and unsuccessful war,
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>With various arts and arms in vain have toil'd,
<A NAME="443"></A><BR>And by a mortal man at length am foil'd.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>If native pow'r prevail not, shall I doubt
<A NAME="445"></A><BR>To seek for needful succor from without?
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>If Jove and Heav'n my just desires deny,
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Hell shall the pow'r of Heav'n and Jove supply.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR>Grant that the Fates have firm'd, by their decree,
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>The Trojan race to reign in Italy;
<A NAME="450"></A><BR>At least I can defer the nuptial day,
<A NAME="451"></A><BR>And with protracted wars the peace delay:
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>With blood the dear alliance shall be bought,
<A NAME="453"></A><BR>And both the people near destruction brought;
<A NAME="454"></A><BR>So shall the son-in-law and father join,
<A NAME="455"></A><BR>With ruin, war, and waste of either line.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR>O fatal maid, thy marriage is endow'd
<A NAME="457"></A><BR>With Phrygian, Latian, andRutulian blood!
<A NAME="458"></A><BR>Bellona leads thee to thy lover's hand;
<A NAME="459"></A><BR>Another queen brings forth another brand,
<A NAME="460"></A><BR>To burn with foreign fires another land!
<A NAME="461"></A><BR>A second Paris, diff'ring but in name,
<A NAME="462"></A><BR>Shall fire his country with a second flame."
<A NAME="463"></A><BR>Thus having said, she sinks beneath the ground,
<A NAME="464"></A><BR>With furious haste, and shoots the Stygian sound,
<A NAME="465"></A><BR>To rouse Alecto from th' infernal seat
<A NAME="466"></A><BR>Of her dire sisters, and their dark retreat.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR>This Fury, fit for her intent, she chose;
<A NAME="468"></A><BR>One who delights in wars and human woes.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR>Ev'n Pluto hates his own misshapen race;
<A NAME="470"></A><BR>Her sister Furies fly her hideous face;
<A NAME="471"></A><BR>So frightful are the forms the monster takes,
<A NAME="472"></A><BR>So fierce the hissings of her speckled snakes.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR>Her Juno finds, and thus inflames her spite:
<A NAME="474"></A><BR>"O virgin daughter of eternal Night,
<A NAME="475"></A><BR>Give me this once thy labor, to sustain
<A NAME="476"></A><BR>My right, and execute my just disdain.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR>Let not the Trojans, with a feign'd pretense
<A NAME="478"></A><BR>Of proffer'd peace, delude the Latian prince.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR>Expel from Italy that odious name,
<A NAME="480"></A><BR>And let not Juno suffer in her fame.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR>'T is thine to ruin realms, o'erturn a state,
<A NAME="482"></A><BR>Betwixt the dearest friends to raise debate,
<A NAME="483"></A><BR>And kindle kindred blood to mutual hate.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR>Thy hand o'er towns the fun'ral torch displays,
<A NAME="485"></A><BR>And forms a thousand ills ten thousand ways.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR>Now shake, out thy fruitful breast, the seeds
<A NAME="487"></A><BR>Of envy, discord, and of cruel deeds:
<A NAME="488"></A><BR>Confound the peace establish'd, and prepare
<A NAME="489"></A><BR>Their souls to hatred, and their hands to war."
<A NAME="490"></A><BR>Smear'd as she was with black Gorgonian blood,
<A NAME="491"></A><BR>The Fury sprang above the Stygian flood;
<A NAME="492"></A><BR>And on her wicker wings, sublime thro' night,
<A NAME="493"></A><BR>She to the Latian palace took her flight:
<A NAME="494"></A><BR>There sought the queen's apartment, stood before
<A NAME="495"></A><BR>The peaceful threshold, and besieg'd the door.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR>Restless Amata lay, her swelling breast
<A NAME="497"></A><BR>Fir'd with disdain for Turnus dispossess'd,
<A NAME="498"></A><BR>And the new nuptials of the Trojan guest.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR>From her black bloody locks the Fury shakes
<A NAME="500"></A><BR>Her darling plague, the fav'rite of her snakes;
<A NAME="501"></A><BR>With her full force she threw the poisonous dart,
<A NAME="502"></A><BR>And fix'd it deep within Amata's heart,
<A NAME="503"></A><BR>That, thus envenom'd, she might kindle rage,
<A NAME="504"></A><BR>And sacrifice to strife her house husband's age.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR>Unseen, unfelt, the fiery serpent skims
<A NAME="506"></A><BR>Betwixt her linen and her naked limbs;
<A NAME="507"></A><BR>His baleful breath inspiring, as he glides,
<A NAME="508"></A><BR>Now like a chain around her neck he rides,
<A NAME="509"></A><BR>Now like a fillet to her head repairs,
<A NAME="510"></A><BR>And with his circling volumes folds her hairs.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR>At first the silent venom slid with ease,
<A NAME="512"></A><BR>And seiz'd her cooler senses by degrees;
<A NAME="513"></A><BR>Then, ere th' infected mass was fir'd too far,
<A NAME="514"></A><BR>In plaintive accents she began the war,
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>And thus bespoke her husband: "Shall," she said,
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>"A wand'ring prince enjoy Lavinia's bed?
<A NAME="517"></A><BR>If nature plead not in a parent's heart,
<A NAME="518"></A><BR>Pity my tears, and pity her desert.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR>I know, my dearest lord, the time will come,
<A NAME="520"></A><BR>You in vain, reverse your cruel doom;
<A NAME="521"></A><BR>The faithless pirate soon will set to sea,
<A NAME="522"></A><BR>And bear the royal virgin far away!
<A NAME="523"></A><BR>A guest like him, a Trojan guest before,
<A NAME="524"></A><BR>In shew of friendship sought the Spartan shore,
<A NAME="525"></A><BR>And ravish'd Helen from her husband bore.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Think on a king's inviolable word;
<A NAME="527"></A><BR>And think on Turnus, her once plighted lord:
<A NAME="528"></A><BR>To this false foreigner you give your throne,
<A NAME="529"></A><BR>And wrong a friend, a kinsman, and a son.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR>Resume your ancient care; and, if the god
<A NAME="531"></A><BR>Your sire, and you, resolve on foreign blood,
<A NAME="532"></A><BR>Know all are foreign, in a larger sense,
<A NAME="533"></A><BR>Not born your subjects, or deriv'd from hence.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR>Then, if the line of Turnus you retrace,
<A NAME="535"></A><BR>He springs from Inachus of Argive race."
<A NAME="536"></A><BR>But when she saw her reasons idly spent,
<A NAME="537"></A><BR>And could not move him from his fix'd intent,
<A NAME="538"></A><BR>She flew to rage; for now the snake possess'd
<A NAME="539"></A><BR>Her vital parts, and poison'd all her breast;
<A NAME="540"></A><BR>She raves, she runs with a distracted pace,
<A NAME="541"></A><BR>And fills with horrid howls the public place.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR>And, as young striplings whip the top for sport,
<A NAME="543"></A><BR>On the smooth pavement of an empty court;
<A NAME="544"></A><BR>The wooden engine flies and whirls about,
<A NAME="545"></A><BR>Admir'd, with clamors, of the beardless rout;
<A NAME="546"></A><BR>They lash aloud; each other they provoke,
<A NAME="547"></A><BR>And lend their little souls at ev'ry stroke:
<A NAME="548"></A><BR>Thus fares the queen; and thus her fury blows
<A NAME="549"></A><BR>Amidst the crowd, and kindles as she goes.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR>Nor yet content, she strains her malice more,
<A NAME="551"></A><BR>And adds new ills to those contriv'd before:
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>She flies the town, and, mixing with a throng
<A NAME="553"></A><BR>Of madding matrons, bears the bride along,
<A NAME="554"></A><BR>Wand'ring thro' woods and wilds, and devious ways,
<A NAME="555"></A><BR>And with these arts the Trojan match delays.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR>She feign'd the rites of Bacchus; cried aloud,
<A NAME="557"></A><BR>And to the buxom god the virgin vow'd.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR>"Evoe! O Bacchus!" thus began the song;
<A NAME="559"></A><BR>And "Evoe!" answer'd all the female throng.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR>"O virgin! worthy thee alone!" she cried;
<A NAME="561"></A><BR>"O worthy thee alone!" the crew replied.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR>"For thee she feeds her hair, she leads thy dance,
<A NAME="563"></A><BR>And with thy winding ivy wreathes her lance."
<A NAME="564"></A><BR>Like fury seiz'd the rest; the progress known,
<A NAME="565"></A><BR>All seek the mountains, and forsake the town:
<A NAME="566"></A><BR>All, clad in skins of beasts, the jav'lin bear,
<A NAME="567"></A><BR>Give to the wanton winds their flowing hair,
<A NAME="568"></A><BR>And shrieks and shoutings rend the suff'ring air.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR>The queen herself, inspir'd with rage divine,
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>Shook high above her head a flaming pine;
<A NAME="571"></A><BR>Then roll'd her haggard eyes around the throng,
<A NAME="572"></A><BR>And sung, in Turnus' name, the nuptial song:
<A NAME="573"></A><BR>"Io, ye Latian dames! if any here
<A NAME="574"></A><BR>Hold your unhappy queen, Amata, dear;
<A NAME="575"></A><BR>If there be here," she said, who dare maintain
<A NAME="576"></A><BR>My right, nor think the name of mother vain;
<A NAME="577"></A><BR>Unbind your fillets, loose your flowing hair,
<A NAME="578"></A><BR>And orgies and nocturnal rites prepare."
<A NAME="579"></A><BR>Amata's breast the Fury thus invades,
<A NAME="580"></A><BR>And fires with rage, amid the sylvan shades;
<A NAME="581"></A><BR>Then, when she found her venom spread so far,
<A NAME="582"></A><BR>The royal house embroil'd in civil war,
<A NAME="583"></A><BR>Rais'd on her dusky wings, she cleaves the skies,
<A NAME="584"></A><BR>And seeks the palace where young Turnus lies.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR>His town, as fame reports, was built of old
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>By Danae, pregnant with almighty gold,
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Who fled her father's rage, and, with a train
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Of following Argives, thro' the stormy main,
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>Driv'n by the southern blasts, was fated here to 
<A NAME="590"></A>reign.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR>'T was Ardua once; now Ardea's name it bears;
<A NAME="592"></A><BR>Once a fair city, now consum'd with years.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>Here, in his lofty palace, Turnus lay,
<A NAME="594"></A><BR>Betwixt the confines of the night and day,
<A NAME="595"></A><BR>Secure in sleep. The Fury laid aside
<A NAME="596"></A><BR>Her looks and limbs, and with new methods tried
<A NAME="597"></A><BR>The foulness of th' infernal form to hide.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR>Propp'd on a staff, she takes a trembling mien:
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>Her face is furrow'd, and her front obscene;
<A NAME="600"></A><BR>Deep-dinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws;
<A NAME="601"></A><BR>Sunk are her eyes, and toothless are her jaws;
<A NAME="602"></A><BR>Her hoary hair with holy fillets bound,
<A NAME="603"></A><BR>Her temples with an olive wreath are crown'd.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR>Old Chalybe, who kept the sacred fane
<A NAME="605"></A><BR>Of Juno, now she seem'd, and thus began,
<A NAME="606"></A><BR>Appearing in a dream, to rouse the careless man:
<A NAME="607"></A><BR>"Shall Turnus then such endless toil sustain
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>In fighting fields, and conquer towns in vain?
<A NAME="609"></A><BR>Win, for a Trojan head to wear the prize,
<A NAME="610"></A><BR>Usurp thy crown, enjoy thy victories?
<A NAME="611"></A><BR>The bride and scepter which thy blood has bought,
<A NAME="612"></A><BR>The king transfers; and foreign heirs are sought.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR>Go now, deluded man, and seek again
<A NAME="614"></A><BR>New toils, new dangers, on the dusty plain.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR>Repel the Tuscan foes; their city seize;
<A NAME="616"></A><BR>Protect the Latians in luxurious ease.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR>This dream all-pow'rful Juno sends; I bear
<A NAME="618"></A><BR>Her mighty mandates, and her words you hear.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR>Haste; arm your Ardeans; issue to the plain;
<A NAME="620"></A><BR>With fate to friend, assault the Trojan train:
<A NAME="621"></A><BR>Their thoughtless chiefs, their painted ships, that 
<A NAME="622"></A>lie
<A NAME="623"></A><BR>In Tiber's mouth, with fire and sword destroy.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR>The Latian king, unless he shall submit,
<A NAME="625"></A><BR>Own his old promise, and his new forget-
<A NAME="626"></A><BR>Let him, in arms, the pow'r of Turnus prove,
<A NAME="627"></A><BR>And learn to fear whom he disdains to love.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR>For such is Heav'n's command." The youthful prince
<A NAME="629"></A><BR>With scorn replied, and made this bold defense:
<A NAME="630"></A><BR>"You tell me, mother, what I knew before:
<A NAME="631"></A><BR>The Phrygian fleet is landed on the shore.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR>I neither fear nor will provoke the war;
<A NAME="633"></A><BR>My fate is Juno's most peculiar care.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR>But time has made you dote, and vainly tell
<A NAME="635"></A><BR>Of arms imagin'd in your lonely cell.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR>Go; be the temple and the gods your care;
<A NAME="637"></A><BR>Permit to men the thought of peace and war."
<A NAME="638"></A><BR>These haughty words Alecto's rage provoke,
<A NAME="639"></A><BR>And frighted Turnus trembled as she spoke.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR>Her eyes grow stiffen'd, and with sulphur burn;
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>Her hideous looks and hellish form return;
<A NAME="642"></A><BR>Her curling snakes with hissings fill the place,
<A NAME="643"></A><BR>And open all the furies of her face:
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>Then, darting fire from her malignant eyes,
<A NAME="645"></A><BR>She cast him backward as he strove to rise,
<A NAME="646"></A><BR>And, ling'ring, sought to frame some new replies.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR>High on her head she rears two twisted snakes,
<A NAME="648"></A><BR>Her chains she rattles, and her whip she shakes;
<A NAME="649"></A><BR>And, churning bloody foam, thus loudly speaks:
<A NAME="650"></A><BR>"Behold whom time has made to dote, and tell
<A NAME="651"></A><BR>Of arms imagin'd in her lonely cell!
<A NAME="652"></A><BR>Behold the Fates' infernal minister!
<A NAME="653"></A><BR>War, death, destruction, in my hand I bear."
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>Thus having said, her smold'ring torch, impress'd
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>With her full force, she plung'd into his breast.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR>Aghast he wak'd; and, starting from his bed,
<A NAME="657"></A><BR>Cold sweat, in clammy drops, his limbs o'erspread.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR>"Arms! arms!" he cries: "my sword and shield prepare!"
<A NAME="659"></A><BR>He breathes defiance, blood, and mortal war.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR>So, when with crackling flames a caldron fries,
<A NAME="661"></A><BR>The bubbling waters from the bottom rise:
<A NAME="662"></A><BR>Above the brims they force their fiery way;
<A NAME="663"></A><BR>Black vapors climb aloft, and cloud the day.
<A NAME="664"></A><BR>The peace polluted thus, a chosen band
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>He first commissions to the Latian land,
<A NAME="666"></A><BR>In threat'ning embassy; then rais'd the rest,
<A NAME="667"></A><BR>To meet in arms th' intruding Trojan guest,
<A NAME="668"></A><BR>To force the foes from the Lavinian shore,
<A NAME="669"></A><BR>And Italy's indanger'd peace restore.
<A NAME="670"></A><BR>Himself alone an equal match he boasts,
<A NAME="671"></A><BR>To fight the Phrygian and Ausonian hosts.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR>The gods invok'd, the Rutuli prepare
<A NAME="673"></A><BR>Their arms, and warn each other to the war.
<A NAME="674"></A><BR>His beauty these, and those his blooming age,
<A NAME="675"></A><BR>The rest his house and his own fame ingage.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR>While Turnus urges thus his enterprise,
<A NAME="677"></A><BR>The Stygian Fury to the Trojans flies;
<A NAME="678"></A><BR>New frauds invents, and takes a steepy stand,
<A NAME="679"></A><BR>Which overlooks the vale with wide command;
<A NAME="680"></A><BR>Where fair Ascanius and his youthful train,
<A NAME="681"></A><BR>With horns and hounds, a hunting match ordain,
<A NAME="682"></A><BR>And pitch their toils around the shady plain.
<A NAME="683"></A><BR>The Fury fires the pack; they snuff, they vent,
<A NAME="684"></A><BR>And feed their hungry nostrils with the scent.
<A NAME="685"></A><BR>'Twas of a well-grown stag, whose antlers rise
<A NAME="686"></A><BR>High o'er his front; his beams invade the skies.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR>From this light cause th' infernal maid prepares
<A NAME="688"></A><BR>The country churls to mischief, hate, and wars.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR>The stately beast the two Tyrrhidae bred,
<A NAME="690"></A><BR>Snatch'd from his dams, and the tame youngling fed.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR>Their father Tyrrheus did his fodder bring,
<A NAME="692"></A><BR>Tyrrheus, chief ranger to the Latian king:
<A NAME="693"></A><BR>Their sister Silvia cherish'd with her care
<A NAME="694"></A><BR>The little wanton, and did wreaths prepare
<A NAME="695"></A><BR>To hang his budding horns, with ribbons tied
<A NAME="696"></A><BR>His tender neck, and comb'd his silken hide,
<A NAME="697"></A><BR>And bathed his body. Patient of command
<A NAME="698"></A><BR>In time he grew, and, growing us'd to hand,
<A NAME="699"></A><BR>He waited at his master's board for food;
<A NAME="700"></A><BR>Then sought his salvage kindred in the wood,
<A NAME="701"></A><BR>Where grazing all the day, at night he came
<A NAME="702"></A><BR>To his known lodgings, and his country dame.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR>This household beast, that us'd the woodland grounds,
<A NAME="704"></A><BR>Was view'd at first by the young hero's hounds,
<A NAME="705"></A><BR>As down the stream he swam, to seek retreat
<A NAME="706"></A><BR>In the cool waters, and to quench his heat.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR>Ascanius young, and eager of his game,
<A NAME="708"></A><BR>Soon bent his bow, uncertain in his aim;
<A NAME="709"></A><BR>But the dire fiend the fatal arrow guides,
<A NAME="710"></A><BR>Which pierc'd his bowels thro' his panting sides.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR>The bleeding creature issues from the floods,
<A NAME="712"></A><BR>Possess'd with fear, and seeks his known abodes,
<A NAME="713"></A><BR>His old familiar hearth and household gods.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR>He falls; he fills the house with heavy groans,
<A NAME="715"></A><BR>Implores their pity, and his pain bemoans.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR>Young Silvia beats her breast, and cries aloud
<A NAME="717"></A><BR>For succor from the clownish neighborhood:
<A NAME="718"></A><BR>The churls assemble; for the fiend, who lay
<A NAME="719"></A><BR>In the close woody covert, urg'd their way.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR>One with a brand yet burning from the flame,
<A NAME="721"></A><BR>Arm'd with a knotty club another came:
<A NAME="722"></A><BR>Whate'er they catch or find, without their care,
<A NAME="723"></A><BR>Their fury makes an instrument of war.
<A NAME="724"></A><BR>Tyrrheus, the foster father of the beast,
<A NAME="725"></A><BR>Then clench'd a hatchet in his horny fist,
<A NAME="726"></A><BR>But held his hand from the descending stroke,
<A NAME="727"></A><BR>And left his wedge within the cloven oak,
<A NAME="728"></A><BR>To whet their courage and their rage provoke.
<A NAME="729"></A><BR>And now the goddess, exercis'd in ill,
<A NAME="730"></A><BR>Who watch'd an hour to work her impious will,
<A NAME="731"></A><BR>Ascends the roof, and to her crooked horn,
<A NAME="732"></A><BR>Such as was then by Latian shepherds borne,
<A NAME="733"></A><BR>Adds all her breath: the rocks and woods around,
<A NAME="734"></A><BR>And mountains, tremble at th' infernal sound.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR>The sacred lake of Trivia from afar,
<A NAME="736"></A><BR>The Veline fountains, and sulphureous Nar,
<A NAME="737"></A><BR>Shake at the baleful blast, the signal of the war.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR>Young mothers wildly stare, with fear possess'd,
<A NAME="739"></A><BR>And strain their helpless infants to their breast.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR>The clowns, a boist'rous, rude, ungovern'd crew,
<A NAME="741"></A><BR>With furious haste to the loud summons flew.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR>The pow'rs of Troy, then issuing on the plain,
<A NAME="743"></A><BR>With fresh recruits their youthful chief sustain:
<A NAME="744"></A><BR>Not theirs a raw and unexperienc'd train,
<A NAME="745"></A><BR>But a firm body of embattled men.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR>At first, while fortune favor'd neither side,
<A NAME="747"></A><BR>The fight with clubs and burning brands was tried;
<A NAME="748"></A><BR>But now, both parties reinforc'd, the fields
<A NAME="749"></A><BR>Are bright with flaming swords and brazen shields.
<A NAME="750"></A><BR>A shining harvest either host displays,
<A NAME="751"></A><BR>And shoots against the sun with equal rays.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR>Thus, when a black-brow'd gust begins to rise,
<A NAME="753"></A><BR>White foam at first on the curl'd ocean fries;
<A NAME="754"></A><BR>Then roars the main, the billows mount the skies;
<A NAME="755"></A><BR>Till, by the fury of the storm full blown,
<A NAME="756"></A><BR>The muddy bottom o'er the clouds is thrown.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR>First Almon falls, old Tyrrheus' eldest care,
<A NAME="758"></A><BR>Pierc'd with an arrow from the distant war:
<A NAME="759"></A><BR>Fix'd in his throat the flying weapon stood,
<A NAME="760"></A><BR>And stopp'd his breath, and drank his vital blood
<A NAME="761"></A><BR>Huge heaps of slain around the body rise:
<A NAME="762"></A><BR>Among the rest, the rich Galesus lies;
<A NAME="763"></A><BR>A good old man, while peace he preach'd in vain,
<A NAME="764"></A><BR>Amidst the madness of th' unruly train:
<A NAME="765"></A><BR>Five herds, five bleating flocks, his pastures fill'd;
<A NAME="766"></A><BR>His lands a hundred yoke of oxen till'd.
<A NAME="767"></A><BR>Thus, while in equal scales their fortune stood
<A NAME="768"></A><BR>The Fury bath'd them in each other's blood;
<A NAME="769"></A><BR>Then, having fix'd the fight, exulting flies,
<A NAME="770"></A><BR>And bears fulfill'd her promise to the skies.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR>To Juno thus she speaks: "Behold! It is done,
<A NAME="772"></A><BR>The blood already drawn, the war begun;
<A NAME="773"></A><BR>The discord is complete; nor can they cease
<A NAME="774"></A><BR>The dire debate, nor you command the peace.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR>Now, since the Latian and the Trojan brood
<A NAME="776"></A><BR>Have tasted vengeance and the sweets of blood;
<A NAME="777"></A><BR>Speak, and my pow'r shall add this office more:
<A NAME="778"></A><BR>The neighb'ing nations of th' Ausonian shore
<A NAME="779"></A><BR>Shall hear the dreadful rumor, from afar,
<A NAME="780"></A><BR>Of arm'd invasion, and embrace the war."
<A NAME="781"></A><BR>Then Juno thus: "The grateful work is done,
<A NAME="782"></A><BR>The seeds of discord sow'd, the war begun;
<A NAME="783"></A><BR>Frauds, fears, and fury have possess'd the state,
<A NAME="784"></A><BR>And fix'd the causes of a lasting hate.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR>A bloody Hymen shall th' alliance join
<A NAME="786"></A><BR>Betwixt the Trojan and Ausonian line:
<A NAME="787"></A><BR>But thou with speed to night and hell repair;
<A NAME="788"></A><BR>For not the gods, nor angry Jove, will bear
<A NAME="789"></A><BR>Thy lawless wand'ring walks in upper air.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR>Leave what remains to me." Saturnia said:
<A NAME="791"></A><BR>The sullen fiend her sounding wings display'd,
<A NAME="792"></A><BR>Unwilling left the light, and sought the nether 
<A NAME="793"></A>shade.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR>In midst of Italy, well known to fame,
<A NAME="795"></A><BR>There lies a lake (Amsanctus is the name)
<A NAME="796"></A><BR>Below the lofty mounts: on either side
<A NAME="797"></A><BR>Thick forests the forbidden entrance hide.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR>Full in the center of the sacred wood
<A NAME="799"></A><BR>An arm arises of the Stygian flood,
<A NAME="800"></A><BR>Which, breaking from beneath with bellowing sound,
<A NAME="801"></A><BR>Whirls the black waves and rattling stones around.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR>Here Pluto pants for breath from out his cell,
<A NAME="803"></A><BR>And opens wide the grinning jaws of hell.
<A NAME="804"></A><BR>To this infernal lake the Fury flies;
<A NAME="805"></A><BR>Here hides her hated head, and frees the lab'ring 
<A NAME="806"></A>skies.
<A NAME="807"></A><BR>Saturnian Juno now, with double care,
<A NAME="808"></A><BR>Attends the fatal process of the war.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR>The clowns, return'd, from battle bear the slain,
<A NAME="810"></A><BR>Implore the gods, and to their king complain.
<A NAME="811"></A><BR>The corps of Almon and the rest are shown;
<A NAME="812"></A><BR>Shrieks, clamors, murmurs, fill the frighted town.
<A NAME="813"></A><BR>Ambitious Turnus in the press appears,
<A NAME="814"></A><BR>And, aggravating crimes, augments their fears;
<A NAME="815"></A><BR>Proclaims his private injuries aloud,
<A NAME="816"></A><BR>A solemn promise made, and disavow'd;
<A NAME="817"></A><BR>A foreign son is sought, and a mix'd mungril brood.
<A NAME="818"></A><BR>Then they, whose mothers, frantic with their fear,
<A NAME="819"></A><BR>In woods and wilds the flags of Bacchus bear,
<A NAME="820"></A><BR>And lead his dances with dishevel'd hair,
<A NAME="821"></A><BR>Increase the clamor, and the war demand,
<A NAME="822"></A><BR>(Such was Amata's interest in the land,)
<A NAME="823"></A><BR>Against the public sanctions of the peace,
<A NAME="824"></A><BR>Against all omens of their ill success.
<A NAME="825"></A><BR>With fates averse, the rout in arms resort,
<A NAME="826"></A><BR>To force their monarch, and insult the court.
<A NAME="827"></A><BR>But, like a rock unmov'd, a rock that braves
<A NAME="828"></A><BR>The raging tempest and the rising waves-
<A NAME="829"></A><BR>Propp'd on himself he stands; his solid sides
<A NAME="830"></A><BR>Wash off the seaweeds, and the sounding tides-
<A NAME="831"></A><BR>So stood the pious prince, unmov'd, and long
<A NAME="832"></A><BR>Sustain'd the madness of the noisy throng.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR>But, when he found that Juno's pow'r prevail'd,
<A NAME="834"></A><BR>And all the methods of cool counsel fail'd,
<A NAME="835"></A><BR>He calls the gods to witness their offense,
<A NAME="836"></A><BR>Disclaims the war, asserts his innocence.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR>"Hurried by fate," he cries, "and borne before
<A NAME="838"></A><BR>A furious wind, we have the faithful shore.
<A NAME="839"></A><BR>O more than madmen! you yourselves shall bear
<A NAME="840"></A><BR>The guilt of blood and sacrilegious war:
<A NAME="841"></A><BR>Thou, Turnus, shalt atone it by thy fate,
<A NAME="842"></A><BR>And pray to Heav'n for peace, but pray too late.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR>For me, my stormy voyage at an end,
<A NAME="844"></A><BR>I to the port of death securely tend.
<A NAME="845"></A><BR>The fun'ral pomp which to your kings you pay,
<A NAME="846"></A><BR>Is all I want, and all you take away."
<A NAME="847"></A><BR>He said no more, but, in his walls confin'd,
<A NAME="848"></A><BR>Shut out the woes which he too well divin'd
<A NAME="849"></A><BR>Nor with the rising storm would vainly strive,
<A NAME="850"></A><BR>But left the helm, and let the vessel drive.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR>A solemn custom was observ'd of old,
<A NAME="852"></A><BR>Which Latium held, and now the Romans hold,
<A NAME="853"></A><BR>Their standard when in fighting fields they rear
<A NAME="854"></A><BR>Against the fierce Hyrcanians, or declare
<A NAME="855"></A><BR>The Scythian, Indian, or Arabian war;
<A NAME="856"></A><BR>Or from the boasting Parthians would regain
<A NAME="857"></A><BR>Their eagles, lost in Carrhae's bloody plain.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR>Two gates of steel (the name of Mars they bear,
<A NAME="859"></A><BR>And still are worship'd with religious fear)
<A NAME="860"></A><BR>Before his temple stand: the dire abode,
<A NAME="861"></A><BR>And the fear'd issues of the furious god,
<A NAME="862"></A><BR>Are fenc'd with brazen bolts; without the gates,
<A NAME="863"></A><BR>The wary guardian Janus doubly waits.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR>Then, when the sacred senate votes the wars,
<A NAME="865"></A><BR>The Roman consul their decree declares,
<A NAME="866"></A><BR>And in his robes the sounding gates unbars.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR>The youth in military shouts arise,
<A NAME="868"></A><BR>And the loud trumpets break the yielding skies.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR>These rites, of old by sov'reign princes us'd,
<A NAME="870"></A><BR>Were the king's office; but the king refus'd,
<A NAME="871"></A><BR>Deaf to their cries, nor would the gates unbar
<A NAME="872"></A><BR>Of sacred peace, or loose th' imprison'd war;
<A NAME="873"></A><BR>But hid his head, and, safe from loud alarms,
<A NAME="874"></A><BR>Abhorr'd the wicked ministry of arms.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR>Then heav'n's imperious queen shot down from high:
<A NAME="876"></A><BR>At her approach the brazen hinges fly;
<A NAME="877"></A><BR>The gates are forc'd, and ev'ry falling bar;
<A NAME="878"></A><BR>And, like a tempest, issues out the war.
<A NAME="879"></A><BR>The peaceful cities of th' Ausonian shore,
<A NAME="880"></A><BR>Lull'd in their ease, and undisturb'd before,
<A NAME="881"></A><BR>Are all on fire; and some, with studious care,
<A NAME="882"></A><BR>Their restiff steeds in sandy plains prepare;
<A NAME="883"></A><BR>Some their soft limbs in painful marches try,
<A NAME="884"></A><BR>And war is all their wish, and arms the gen'ral 
<A NAME="885"></A>cry.
<A NAME="886"></A><BR>Part scour the rusty shields with seam; and part
<A NAME="887"></A><BR>New grind the blunted ax, and point the dart:
<A NAME="888"></A><BR>With joy they view the waving ensigns fly,
<A NAME="889"></A><BR>And hear the trumpet's clangor pierce the sky.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR>Five cities forge their arms: th' Atinian pow'rs,
<A NAME="891"></A><BR>Antemnae, Tibur with her lofty tow'rs,
<A NAME="892"></A><BR>Ardea the proud, the Crustumerian town:
<A NAME="893"></A><BR>All these of old were places of renown.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR>Some hammer helmets for the fighting field;
<A NAME="895"></A><BR>Some twine young sallows to support the shield;
<A NAME="896"></A><BR>The croslet some, and some the cuishes mold,
<A NAME="897"></A><BR>With silver plated, and with ductile gold.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR>The rustic honors of the scythe and share
<A NAME="899"></A><BR>Give place to swords and plumes, the pride of war.
<A NAME="900"></A><BR>Old fauchions are new temper'd in the fires;
<A NAME="901"></A><BR>The sounding trumpet ev'ry soul inspires.
<A NAME="902"></A><BR>The word is giv'n; with eager speed they lace
<A NAME="903"></A><BR>The shining headpiece, and the shield embrace.
<A NAME="904"></A><BR>The neighing steeds are to the chariot tied;
<A NAME="905"></A><BR>The trusty weapon sits on ev'ry side.
<A NAME="906"></A><BR>And now the mighty labor is begun
<A NAME="907"></A><BR>Ye Muses, open all your Helicon.
<A NAME="908"></A><BR>Sing you the chiefs that sway'd th' Ausonian land,
<A NAME="909"></A><BR>Their arms, and armies under their command;
<A NAME="910"></A><BR>What warriors in our ancient clime were bred;
<A NAME="911"></A><BR>What soldiers follow'd, and what heroes led.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR>For well you know, and can record alone,
<A NAME="913"></A><BR>What fame to future times conveys but darkly down.
<A NAME="914"></A><BR>Mezentius first appear'd upon the plain:
<A NAME="915"></A><BR>Scorn sate upon his brows, and sour disdain,
<A NAME="916"></A><BR>Defying earth and heav'n. Etruria lost,
<A NAME="917"></A><BR>He brings to Turnus' aid his baffled host.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR>The charming Lausus, full of youthful fire,
<A NAME="919"></A><BR>Rode in the rank, and next his sullen sire;
<A NAME="920"></A><BR>To Turnus only second in the grace
<A NAME="921"></A><BR>Of manly mien, and features of the face.
<A NAME="922"></A><BR>A skilful horseman, and a huntsman bred,
<A NAME="923"></A><BR>With fates averse a thousand men he led:
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>His sire unworthy of so brave a son;
<A NAME="925"></A><BR>Himself well worthy of a happier throne.
<A NAME="926"></A><BR>Next Aventinus drives his chariot round
<A NAME="927"></A><BR>The Latian plains, with palms and laurels crown'd.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR>Proud of his steeds, he smokes along the field;
<A NAME="929"></A><BR>His father's hydra fills his ample shield:
<A NAME="930"></A><BR>A hundred serpents hiss about the brims;
<A NAME="931"></A><BR>The son of Hercules he justly seems
<A NAME="932"></A><BR>By his broad shoulders and gigantic limbs;
<A NAME="933"></A><BR>Of heav'nly part, and part of earthly blood,
<A NAME="934"></A><BR>A mortal woman mixing with a god.
<A NAME="935"></A><BR>For strong Alcides, after he had slain
<A NAME="936"></A><BR>The triple Geryon, drove from conquer'd Spain
<A NAME="937"></A><BR>His captive herds; and, thence in triumph led,
<A NAME="938"></A><BR>On Tuscan Tiber's flow'ry banks they fed.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR>Then on Mount Aventine the son of Jove
<A NAME="940"></A><BR>The priestess Rhea found, and forc'd to love.
<A NAME="941"></A><BR>For arms, his men long piles and jav'lins bore;
<A NAME="942"></A><BR>And poles with pointed steel their foes in battle 
<A NAME="943"></A>gore.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR>Like Hercules himself his son appears,
<A NAME="945"></A><BR>In salvage pomp; a lion's hide he wears;
<A NAME="946"></A><BR>About his shoulders hangs the shaggy skin;
<A NAME="947"></A><BR>The teeth and gaping jaws severely grin.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR>Thus, like the god his father, homely dress'd,
<A NAME="949"></A><BR>He strides into the hall, a horrid guest.
<A NAME="950"></A><BR>Then two twin brothers from fair Tibur came,
<A NAME="951"></A><BR>(Which from their brother Tiburs took the name,)
<A NAME="952"></A><BR>Fierce Coras and Catillus, void of fear:
<A NAME="953"></A><BR>Arm'd Argive horse they led, and in the front appear.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR>Like cloud-born Centaurs, from the mountain's height
<A NAME="955"></A><BR>With rapid course descending to the fight;
<A NAME="956"></A><BR>They rush along; the rattling woods give way;
<A NAME="957"></A><BR>The branches bend before their sweepy sway.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR>Nor was Praeneste's founder wanting there,
<A NAME="959"></A><BR>Whom fame reports the son of Mulciber:
<A NAME="960"></A><BR>Found in the fire, and foster'd in the plains,
<A NAME="961"></A><BR>A shepherd and a king at once he reigns,
<A NAME="962"></A><BR>And leads to Turnus' aid his country swains.
<A NAME="963"></A><BR>His own Praeneste sends a chosen band,
<A NAME="964"></A><BR>With those who plow Saturnia's Gabine land;
<A NAME="965"></A><BR>Besides the succor which cold Anien yields,
<A NAME="966"></A><BR>The rocks of Hernicus, and dewy fields,
<A NAME="967"></A><BR>Anagnia fat, and Father Amasene-
<A NAME="968"></A><BR>A num'rous rout, but all of naked men:
<A NAME="969"></A><BR>Nor arms they wear, nor swords and bucklers wield,
<A NAME="970"></A><BR>Nor drive the chariot thro' the dusty field,
<A NAME="971"></A><BR>But whirl from leathern slings huge balls of lead,
<A NAME="972"></A><BR>And spoils of yellow wolves adorn their head;
<A NAME="973"></A><BR>The left foot naked, when they march to fight,
<A NAME="974"></A><BR>But in a bull's raw hide they sheathe the right.
<A NAME="975"></A><BR>Messapus next, (great Neptune was his sire,)
<A NAME="976"></A><BR>Secure of steel, and fated from the fire,
<A NAME="977"></A><BR>In pomp appears, and with his ardor warms
<A NAME="978"></A><BR>A heartless train, unexercis'd in arms:
<A NAME="979"></A><BR>The just Faliscans he to battle brings,
<A NAME="980"></A><BR>And those who live where Lake Ciminia springs;
<A NAME="981"></A><BR>And where Feronia's grove and temple stands,
<A NAME="982"></A><BR>Who till Fescennian or Flavinian lands.
<A NAME="983"></A><BR>All these in order march, and marching sing
<A NAME="984"></A><BR>The warlike actions of their sea-born king;
<A NAME="985"></A><BR>Like a long team of snowy swans on high,
<A NAME="986"></A><BR>Which clap their wings, and cleave the liquid sky,
<A NAME="987"></A><BR>When, homeward from their wat'ry pastures borne,
<A NAME="988"></A><BR>They sing, and Asia's lakes their notes return.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR>Not one who heard their music from afar,
<A NAME="990"></A><BR>Would think these troops an army train'd to war,
<A NAME="991"></A><BR>But flocks of fowl, that, when the tempests roar,
<A NAME="992"></A><BR>With their hoarse gabbling seek the silent shore.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR>Then Clausus came, who led a num'rous band
<A NAME="994"></A><BR>Of troops embodied from the Sabine land,
<A NAME="995"></A><BR>And, in himself alone, an army brought.
<A NAME="996"></A><BR>'T was he, the noble Claudian race begot,
<A NAME="997"></A><BR>The Claudian race, ordain'd, in times to come,
<A NAME="998"></A><BR>To share the greatness of imperial Rome.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR>He led the Cures forth, of old renown,
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR>Mutuscans from their olive-bearing town,
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR>And all th' Eretian pow'rs; besides a band
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR>That follow'd from Velinum's dewy land,
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR>And Amiternian troops, of mighty fame,
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR>And mountaineers, that from Severus came,
<A NAME="1005"></A><BR>And from the craggy cliffs of Tetrica,
<A NAME="1006"></A><BR>And those where yellow Tiber takes his way,
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR>And where Himella's wanton waters play.
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR>Casperia sends her arms, with those that lie
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR>By Fabaris, and fruitful Foruli:
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR>The warlike aids of Horta next appear,
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR>And the cold Nursians come to close the rear,
<A NAME="1012"></A><BR>Mix'd with the natives born of Latine blood,
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR>Whom Allia washes with her fatal flood.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR>Not thicker billows beat the Libyan main,
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR>When pale Orion sets in wintry rain;
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR>Nor thicker harvests on rich Hermus rise,
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR>Or Lycian fields, when Phoebus burns the skies,
<A NAME="1018"></A><BR>Than stand these troops: their bucklers ring around;
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR>Their trampling turns the turf, and shakes the solid 
<A NAME="1020"></A>ground.
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR>High in his chariot then Halesus came,
<A NAME="1022"></A><BR>A foe by birth to Troy's unhappy name:
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR>From Agamemnon born- to Turnus' aid
<A NAME="1024"></A><BR>A thousand men the youthful hero led,
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR>Who till the Massic soil, for wine renown'd,
<A NAME="1026"></A><BR>And fierce Auruncans from their hilly ground,
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR>And those who live by Sidicinian shores,
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR>And where with shoaly fords Vulturnus roars,
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR>Cales' and Osca's old inhabitants,
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR>And rough Saticulans, inur'd to wants:
<A NAME="1031"></A><BR>Light demi-lances from afar they throw,
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR>Fasten'd with leathern thongs, to gall the foe.
<A NAME="1033"></A><BR>Short crooked swords in closer fight they wear;
<A NAME="1034"></A><BR>And on their warding arm light bucklers bear.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR>Nor Oebalus, shalt thou be left unsung,
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR>From nymph Semethis and old Telon sprung,
<A NAME="1037"></A><BR>Who then in Teleboan Capri reign'd;
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR>But that short isle th' ambitious youth disdain'd,
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR>And o'er Campania stretch'd his ample sway,
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR>Where swelling Sarnus seeks the Tyrrhene sea;
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR>O'er Batulum, and where Abella sees,
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR>From her high tow'rs, the harvest of her trees.
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR>And these (as was the Teuton use of old)
<A NAME="1044"></A><BR>Wield brazen swords, and brazen bucklers hold;
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR>Sling weighty stones, when from afar they fight;
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR>Their casques are cork, a covering thick and light.
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR>Next these in rank, the warlike Ufens went,
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR>And led the mountain troops that Nursia sent.
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR>The rude Equicolae his rule obey'd;
<A NAME="1050"></A><BR>Hunting their sport, and plund'ring was their trade.
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR>In arms they plow'd, to battle still prepar'd:
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR>Their soil was barren, and their hearts were hard.
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR>Umbro the priest the proud Marrubians led,
<A NAME="1054"></A><BR>By King Archippus sent to Turnus' aid,
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR>And peaceful olives crown'd his hoary head.
<A NAME="1056"></A><BR>His wand and holy words, the viper's rage,
<A NAME="1057"></A><BR>And venom'd wounds of serpents could assuage.
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR>He, when he pleas'd with powerful juice to steep
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR>Their temples, shut their eyes in pleasing sleep.
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR>But vain were Marsian herbs, and magic art,
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR>To cure the wound giv'n by the Dardan dart:
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR>Yet his untimely fate th' Angitian woods
<A NAME="1063"></A><BR>In sighs remurmur'd to the Fucine floods.
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR>The son of fam'd Hippolytus was there,
<A NAME="1065"></A><BR>Fam'd as his sire, and, as his mother, fair;
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR>Whom in Egerian groves Aricia bore,
<A NAME="1067"></A><BR>And nurs'd his youth along the marshy shore,
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR>Where great Diana's peaceful altars flame,
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR>In fruitful fields; and Virbius was his name.
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR>Hippolytus, as old records have said,
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR>Was by his stepdam sought to share her bed;
<A NAME="1072"></A><BR>But, when no female arts his mind could move,
<A NAME="1073"></A><BR>She turn'd to furious hate her impious love.
<A NAME="1074"></A><BR>Torn by wild horses on the sandy shore,
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR>Another's crimes th' unhappy hunter bore,
<A NAME="1076"></A><BR>Glutting his father's eyes with guiltless gore.
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR>But chaste Diana, who his death deplor'd,
<A NAME="1078"></A><BR>With Aesculapian herbs his life restor'd.
<A NAME="1079"></A><BR>Then Jove, who saw from high, with just disdain,
<A NAME="1080"></A><BR>The dead inspir'd with vital breath again,
<A NAME="1081"></A><BR>Struck to the center, with his flaming dart,
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR>Th' unhappy founder of the godlike art.
<A NAME="1083"></A><BR>But Trivia kept in secret shades alone
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR>Her care, Hippolytus, to fate unknown;
<A NAME="1085"></A><BR>And call'd him Virbius in th' Egerian grove,
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR>Where then he liv'd obscure, but safe from Jove.
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR>For this, from Trivia's temple and her wood
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR>Are coursers driv'n, who shed their master's blood,
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR>Affrighted by the monsters of the flood.
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR>His son, the second Virbius, yet retain'd
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR>His father's art, and warrior steeds he rein'd.
<A NAME="1092"></A><BR>Amid the troops, and like the leading god,
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR>High o'er the rest in arms the graceful Turnus rode:
<A NAME="1094"></A><BR>A triple of plumes his crest adorn'd,
<A NAME="1095"></A><BR>On which with belching flames Chimaera burn'd:
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR>The more the kindled combat rises high'r,
<A NAME="1097"></A><BR>The more with fury burns the blazing fire.
<A NAME="1098"></A><BR>Fair Io grac'd his shield; but Io now
<A NAME="1099"></A><BR>With horns exalted stands, and seems to low-
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR>A noble charge! Her keeper by her side,
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR>To watch her walks, his hundred eyes applied;
<A NAME="1102"></A><BR>And on the brims her sire, the wat'ry god,
<A NAME="1103"></A><BR>Roll'd from a silver urn his crystal flood.
<A NAME="1104"></A><BR>A cloud of foot succeeds, and fills the fields
<A NAME="1105"></A><BR>With swords, and pointed spears, and clatt'ring 
<A NAME="1106"></A>shields;
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR>Of Argives, and of old Sicanian bands,
<A NAME="1108"></A><BR>And those who plow the rich Rutulian lands;
<A NAME="1109"></A><BR>Auruncan youth, and those Sacrana yields,
<A NAME="1110"></A><BR>And the proud Labicans, with painted shields,
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR>And those who near Numician streams reside,
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR>And those whom Tiber's holy forests hide,
<A NAME="1113"></A><BR>Or Circe's hills from the main land divide;
<A NAME="1114"></A><BR>Where Ufens glides along the lowly lands,
<A NAME="1115"></A><BR>Or the black water of Pomptina stands.
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR>Last, from the Volscians fair Camilla came,
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR>And led her warlike troops, a warrior dame;
<A NAME="1118"></A><BR>Unbred to spinning, in the loom unskill'd,
<A NAME="1119"></A><BR>She chose the nobler Pallas of the field.
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR>Mix'd with the first, the fierce virago fought,
<A NAME="1121"></A><BR>Sustain'd the toils of arms, the danger sought,
<A NAME="1122"></A><BR>Outstripp'd the winds in speed upon the plain,
<A NAME="1123"></A><BR>Flew o'er the fields, nor hurt the bearded grain:
<A NAME="1124"></A><BR>She swept the seas, and, as she skimm'd along,
<A NAME="1125"></A><BR>Her flying feet unbath'd on billows hung.
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR>Men, boys, and women, stupid with surprise,
<A NAME="1127"></A><BR>Where'er she passes, fix their wond'ring eyes:
<A NAME="1128"></A><BR>Longing they look, and, gaping at the sight,
<A NAME="1129"></A><BR>Devour her o'er and o'er with vast delight;
<A NAME="1130"></A><BR>Her purple habit sits with such a grace
<A NAME="1131"></A><BR>On her smooth shoulders, and so suits her face;
<A NAME="1132"></A><BR>Her head with ringlets of her hair is crown'd,
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR>And in a golden caul the curls are bound.
<A NAME="1134"></A><BR>She shakes her myrtle jav'lin; and, behind,
<A NAME="1135"></A><BR>Her Lycian quiver dances in the wind.
