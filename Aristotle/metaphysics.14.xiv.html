<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>"REGARDING this kind of substance, what we have said must be taken 
<A NAME="13"></A>as sufficient. All philosophers make the first principles contraries: as 
<A NAME="14"></A>in natural things, so also in the case of unchangeable substances. But 
<A NAME="15"></A>since there cannot be anything prior to the first principle of all things, 
<A NAME="16"></A>the principle cannot be the principle and yet be an attribute of something 
<A NAME="17"></A>else. To suggest this is like saying that the white is a first principle, 
<A NAME="18"></A>not qua anything else but qua white, but yet that it is predicable of a 
<A NAME="19"></A>subject, i.e. that its being white presupposes its being something else; 
<A NAME="20"></A>this is absurd, for then that subject will be prior. But all things which 
<A NAME="21"></A>are generated from their contraries involve an underlying subject; a subject, 
<A NAME="22"></A>then, must be present in the case of contraries, if anywhere. All contraries, 
<A NAME="23"></A>then, are always predicable of a subject, and none can exist apart, but 
<A NAME="24"></A>just as appearances suggest that there is nothing contrary to substance, 
<A NAME="25"></A>argument confirms this. No contrary, then, is the first principle of all 
<A NAME="26"></A>things in the full sense; the first principle is something different. <BR><BR>"But 
<A NAME="27"></A>these thinkers make one of the contraries matter, some making the unequal 
<A NAME="28"></A>which they take to be the essence of plurality-matter for the One, and 
<A NAME="29"></A>others making plurality matter for the One. (The former generate numbers 
<A NAME="30"></A>out of the dyad of the unequal, i.e. of the great and small, and the other 
<A NAME="31"></A>thinker we have referred to generates them out of plurality, while according 
<A NAME="32"></A>to both it is generated by the essence of the One.) For even the philosopher 
<A NAME="33"></A>who says the unequal and the One are the elements, and the unequal is a 
<A NAME="34"></A>dyad composed of the great and small, treats the unequal, or the great 
<A NAME="35"></A>and the small, as being one, and does not draw the distinction that they 
<A NAME="36"></A>are one in definition, but not in number. But they do not describe rightly 
<A NAME="37"></A>even the principles which they call elements, for some name the great and 
<A NAME="38"></A>the small with the One and treat these three as elements of numbers, two 
<A NAME="39"></A>being matter, one the form; while others name the many and few, because 
<A NAME="40"></A>the great and the small are more appropriate in their nature to magnitude 
<A NAME="41"></A>than to number; and others name rather the universal character common to 
<A NAME="42"></A>these-'that which exceeds and that which is exceeded'. None of these varieties 
<A NAME="43"></A>of opinion makes any difference to speak of, in view of some of the consequences; 
<A NAME="44"></A>they affect only the abstract objections, which these thinkers take care 
<A NAME="45"></A>to avoid because the demonstrations they themselves offer are abstract,-with 
<A NAME="46"></A>this exception, that if the exceeding and the exceeded are the principles, 
<A NAME="47"></A>and not the great and the small, consistency requires that number should 
<A NAME="48"></A>come from the elements before does; for number is more universal than as 
<A NAME="49"></A>the exceeding and the exceeded are more universal than the great and the 
<A NAME="50"></A>small. But as it is, they say one of these things but do not say the other. 
<A NAME="51"></A>Others oppose the different and the other to the One, and others oppose 
<A NAME="52"></A>plurality to the One. But if, as they claim, things consist of contraries, 
<A NAME="53"></A>and to the One either there is nothing contrary, or if there is to be anything 
<A NAME="54"></A>it is plurality, and the unequal is contrary to the equal, and the different 
<A NAME="55"></A>to the same, and the other to the thing itself, those who oppose the One 
<A NAME="56"></A>to plurality have most claim to plausibility, but even their view is inadequate, 
<A NAME="57"></A>for the One would on their view be a few; for plurality is opposed to fewness, 
<A NAME="58"></A>and the many to the few. <BR><BR>"'The one' evidently means a measure. 
<A NAME="59"></A>And in every case there is some underlying thing with a distinct nature 
<A NAME="60"></A>of its own, e.g. in the scale a quarter-tone, in spatial magnitude a finger 
<A NAME="61"></A>or a foot or something of the sort, in rhythms a beat or a syllable; and 
<A NAME="62"></A>similarly in gravity it is a definite weight; and in the same way in all 
<A NAME="63"></A>cases, in qualities a quality, in quantities a quantity (and the measure 
<A NAME="64"></A>is indivisible, in the former case in kind, and in the latter to the sense); 
<A NAME="65"></A>which implies that the one is not in itself the substance of anything. 
<A NAME="66"></A>And this is reasonable; for 'the one' means the measure of some plurality, 
<A NAME="67"></A>and 'number' means a measured plurality and a plurality of measures. (Thus 
<A NAME="68"></A>it is natural that one is not a number; for the measure is not measures, 
<A NAME="69"></A>but both the measure and the one are starting-points.) The measure must 
<A NAME="70"></A>always be some identical thing predicable of all the things it measures, 
<A NAME="71"></A>e.g. if the things are horses, the measure is 'horse', and if they are 
<A NAME="72"></A>men, 'man'. If they are a man, a horse, and a god, the measure is perhaps 
<A NAME="73"></A>'living being', and the number of them will be a number of living beings. 
<A NAME="74"></A>If the things are 'man' and 'pale' and 'walking', these will scarcely have 
<A NAME="75"></A>a number, because all belong to a subject which is one and the same in 
<A NAME="76"></A>number, yet the number of these will be a number of 'kinds' or of some 
<A NAME="77"></A>such term. <BR><BR>"Those who treat the unequal as one thing, and the dyad 
<A NAME="78"></A>as an indefinite compound of great and small, say what is very far from 
<A NAME="79"></A>being probable or possible. For (a) these are modifications and accidents, 
<A NAME="80"></A>rather than substrata, of numbers and magnitudes-the many and few of number, 
<A NAME="81"></A>and the great and small of magnitude-like even and odd, smooth and rough, 
<A NAME="82"></A>straight and curved. Again, (b) apart from this mistake, the great and 
<A NAME="83"></A>the small, and so on, must be relative to something; but what is relative 
<A NAME="84"></A>is least of all things a kind of entity or substance, and is posterior 
<A NAME="85"></A>to quality and quantity; and the relative is an accident of quantity, as 
<A NAME="86"></A>was said, not its matter, since something with a distinct nature of its 
<A NAME="87"></A>own must serve as matter both to the relative in general and to its parts 
<A NAME="88"></A>and kinds. For there is nothing either great or small, many or few, or, 
<A NAME="89"></A>in general, relative to something else, which without having a nature of 
<A NAME="90"></A>its own is many or few, great or small, or relative to something else. 
<A NAME="91"></A>A sign that the relative is least of all a substance and a real thing is 
<A NAME="92"></A>the fact that it alone has no proper generation or destruction or movement, 
<A NAME="93"></A>as in respect of quantity there is increase and diminution, in respect 
<A NAME="94"></A>of quality alteration, in respect of place locomotion, in respect of substance 
<A NAME="95"></A>simple generation and destruction. In respect of relation there is no proper 
<A NAME="96"></A>change; for, without changing, a thing will be now greater and now less 
<A NAME="97"></A>or equal, if that with which it is compared has changed in quantity. And 
<A NAME="98"></A>(c) the matter of each thing, and therefore of substance, must be that 
<A NAME="99"></A>which is potentially of the nature in question; but the relative is neither 
<A NAME="100"></A>potentially nor actually substance. It is strange, then, or rather impossible, 
<A NAME="101"></A>to make not-substance an element in, and prior to, substance; for all the 
<A NAME="102"></A>categories are posterior to substance. Again, (d) elements are not predicated 
<A NAME="103"></A>of the things of which they are elements, but many and few are predicated 
<A NAME="104"></A>both apart and together of number, and long and short of the line, and 
<A NAME="105"></A>both broad and narrow apply to the plane. If there is a plurality, then, 
<A NAME="106"></A>of which the one term, viz. few, is always predicated, e.g. 2 (which cannot 
<A NAME="107"></A>be many, for if it were many, 1 would be few), there must be also one which 
<A NAME="108"></A>is absolutely many, e.g. 10 is many (if there is no number which is greater 
<A NAME="109"></A>than 10), or 10,000. How then, in view of this, can number consist of few 
<A NAME="110"></A>and many? Either both ought to be predicated of it, or neither; but in 
<A NAME="111"></A>fact only the one or the other is predicated.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="112"></A><B>Part 2</B>
<A NAME="113"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>"We must inquire generally, whether eternal things can consist 
<A NAME="115"></A>of elements. If they do, they will have matter; for everything that consists 
<A NAME="116"></A>of elements is composite. Since, then, even if a thing exists for ever, 
<A NAME="117"></A>out of that of which it consists it would necessarily also, if it had come 
<A NAME="118"></A>into being, have come into being, and since everything comes to be what 
<A NAME="119"></A>it comes to be out of that which is it potentially (for it could not have 
<A NAME="120"></A>come to be out of that which had not this capacity, nor could it consist 
<A NAME="121"></A>of such elements), and since the potential can be either actual or not,-this 
<A NAME="122"></A>being so, however everlasting number or anything else that has matter is, 
<A NAME="123"></A>it must be capable of not existing, just as that which is any number of 
<A NAME="124"></A>years old is as capable of not existing as that which is a day old; if 
<A NAME="125"></A>this is capable of not existing, so is that which has lasted for a time 
<A NAME="126"></A>so long that it has no limit. They cannot, then, be eternal, since that 
<A NAME="127"></A>which is capable of not existing is not eternal, as we had occasion to 
<A NAME="128"></A>show in another context. If that which we are now saying is true universally-that 
<A NAME="129"></A>no substance is eternal unless it is actuality-and if the elements are 
<A NAME="130"></A>matter that underlies substance, no eternal substance can have elements 
<A NAME="131"></A>present in it, of which it consists. <BR><BR>"There are some who describe 
<A NAME="132"></A>the element which acts with the One as an indefinite dyad, and object to 
<A NAME="133"></A>'the unequal', reasonably enough, because of the ensuing difficulties; 
<A NAME="134"></A>but they have got rid only of those objections which inevitably arise from 
<A NAME="135"></A>the treatment of the unequal, i.e. the relative, as an element; those which 
<A NAME="136"></A>arise apart from this opinion must confront even these thinkers, whether 
<A NAME="137"></A>it is ideal number, or mathematical, that they construct out of those elements. 
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>"There are many causes which led them off into these explanations, 
<A NAME="139"></A>and especially the fact that they framed the difficulty in an obsolete 
<A NAME="140"></A>form. For they thought that all things that are would be one (viz. Being 
<A NAME="141"></A>itself), if one did not join issue with and refute the saying of Parmenides: 
<A NAME="142"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>"'For never will this he proved, that things that are not are.' 
<A NAME="144"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>"They thought it necessary to prove that that which is not is; 
<A NAME="146"></A>for only thus-of that which is and something else-could the things that 
<A NAME="147"></A>are be composed, if they are many. <BR><BR>"But, first, if 'being' has 
<A NAME="148"></A>many senses (for it means sometimes substance, sometimes that it is of 
<A NAME="149"></A>a certain quality, sometimes that it is of a certain quantity, and at other 
<A NAME="150"></A>times the other categories), what sort of 'one', then, are all the things 
<A NAME="151"></A>that are, if non-being is to be supposed not to be? Is it the substances 
<A NAME="152"></A>that are one, or the affections and similarly the other categories as well, 
<A NAME="153"></A>or all together-so that the 'this' and the 'such' and the 'so much' and 
<A NAME="154"></A>the other categories that indicate each some one class of being will all 
<A NAME="155"></A>be one? But it is strange, or rather impossible, that the coming into play 
<A NAME="156"></A>of a single thing should bring it about that part of that which is is a 
<A NAME="157"></A>'this', part a 'such', part a 'so much', part a 'here'. <BR><BR>"Secondly, 
<A NAME="158"></A>of what sort of non-being and being do the things that are consist? For 
<A NAME="159"></A>'nonbeing' also has many senses, since 'being' has; and 'not being a man' 
<A NAME="160"></A>means not being a certain substance, 'not being straight' not being of 
<A NAME="161"></A>a certain quality, 'not being three cubits long' not being of a certain 
<A NAME="162"></A>quantity. What sort of being and non-being, then, by their union pluralize 
<A NAME="163"></A>the things that are? This thinker means by the non-being the union of which 
<A NAME="164"></A>with being pluralizes the things that are, the false and the character 
<A NAME="165"></A>of falsity. This is also why it used to be said that we must assume something 
<A NAME="166"></A>that is false, as geometers assume the line which is not a foot long to 
<A NAME="167"></A>be a foot long. But this cannot be so. For neither do geometers assume 
<A NAME="168"></A>anything false (for the enunciation is extraneous to the inference), nor 
<A NAME="169"></A>is it non-being in this sense that the things that are are generated from 
<A NAME="170"></A>or resolved into. But since 'non-being' taken in its various cases has 
<A NAME="171"></A>as many senses as there are categories, and besides this the false is said 
<A NAME="172"></A>not to be, and so is the potential, it is from this that generation proceeds, 
<A NAME="173"></A>man from that which is not man but potentially man, and white from that 
<A NAME="174"></A>which is not white but potentially white, and this whether it is some one 
<A NAME="175"></A>thing that is generated or many. <BR><BR>"The question evidently is, how 
<A NAME="176"></A>being, in the sense of 'the substances', is many; for the things that are 
<A NAME="177"></A>generated are numbers and lines and bodies. Now it is strange to inquire 
<A NAME="178"></A>how being in the sense of the 'what' is many, and not how either qualities 
<A NAME="179"></A>or quantities are many. For surely the indefinite dyad or 'the great and 
<A NAME="180"></A>the small' is not a reason why there should be two kinds of white or many 
<A NAME="181"></A>colours or flavours or shapes; for then these also would be numbers and 
<A NAME="182"></A>units. But if they had attacked these other categories, they would have 
<A NAME="183"></A>seen the cause of the plurality in substances also; for the same thing 
<A NAME="184"></A>or something analogous is the cause. This aberration is the reason also 
<A NAME="185"></A>why in seeking the opposite of being and the one, from which with being 
<A NAME="186"></A>and the one the things that are proceed, they posited the relative term 
<A NAME="187"></A>(i.e. the unequal), which is neither the contrary nor the contradictory 
<A NAME="188"></A>of these, and is one kind of being as 'what' and quality also are. <BR><BR>"They 
<A NAME="189"></A>should have asked this question also, how relative terms are many and not 
<A NAME="190"></A>one. But as it is, they inquire how there are many units besides the first 
<A NAME="191"></A>1, but do not go on to inquire how there are many unequals besides the 
<A NAME="192"></A>unequal. Yet they use them and speak of great and small, many and few (from 
<A NAME="193"></A>which proceed numbers), long and short (from which proceeds the line), 
<A NAME="194"></A>broad and narrow (from which proceeds the plane), deep and shallow (from 
<A NAME="195"></A>which proceed solids); and they speak of yet more kinds of relative term. 
<A NAME="196"></A>What is the reason, then, why there is a plurality of these? <BR><BR>"It 
<A NAME="197"></A>is necessary, then, as we say, to presuppose for each thing that which 
<A NAME="198"></A>is it potentially; and the holder of these views further declared what 
<A NAME="199"></A>that is which is potentially a 'this' and a substance but is not in itself 
<A NAME="200"></A>being-viz. that it is the relative (as if he had said 'the qualitative'), 
<A NAME="201"></A>which is neither potentially the one or being, nor the negation of the 
<A NAME="202"></A>one nor of being, but one among beings. And it was much more necessary, 
<A NAME="203"></A>as we said, if he was inquiring how beings are many, not to inquire about 
<A NAME="204"></A>those in the same category-how there are many substances or many qualities-but 
<A NAME="205"></A>how beings as a whole are many; for some are substances, some modifications, 
<A NAME="206"></A>some relations. In the categories other than substance there is yet another 
<A NAME="207"></A>problem involved in the existence of plurality. Since they are not separable 
<A NAME="208"></A>from substances, qualities and quantities are many just because their substratum 
<A NAME="209"></A>becomes and is many; yet there ought to be a matter for each category; 
<A NAME="210"></A>only it cannot be separable from substances. But in the case of 'thises', 
<A NAME="211"></A>it is possible to explain how the 'this' is many things, unless a thing 
<A NAME="212"></A>is to be treated as both a 'this' and a general character. The difficulty 
<A NAME="213"></A>arising from the facts about substances is rather this, how there are actually 
<A NAME="214"></A>many substances and not one. <BR><BR>"But further, if the 'this' and the 
<A NAME="215"></A>quantitative are not the same, we are not told how and why the things that 
<A NAME="216"></A>are are many, but how quantities are many. For all 'number' means a quantity, 
<A NAME="217"></A>and so does the 'unit', unless it means a measure or the quantitatively 
<A NAME="218"></A>indivisible. If, then, the quantitative and the 'what' are different, we 
<A NAME="219"></A>are not told whence or how the 'what' is many; but if any one says they 
<A NAME="220"></A>are the same, he has to face many inconsistencies. <BR><BR>"One might fix 
<A NAME="221"></A>one's attention also on the question, regarding the numbers, what justifies 
<A NAME="222"></A>the belief that they exist. To the believer in Ideas they provide some 
<A NAME="223"></A>sort of cause for existing things, since each number is an Idea, and the 
<A NAME="224"></A>Idea is to other things somehow or other the cause of their being; for 
<A NAME="225"></A>let this supposition be granted them. But as for him who does not hold 
<A NAME="226"></A>this view because he sees the inherent objections to the Ideas (so that 
<A NAME="227"></A>it is not for this reason that he posits numbers), but who posits mathematical 
<A NAME="228"></A>number, why must we believe his statement that such number exists, and 
<A NAME="229"></A>of what use is such number to other things? Neither does he who says it 
<A NAME="230"></A>exists maintain that it is the cause of anything (he rather says it is 
<A NAME="231"></A>a thing existing by itself), nor is it observed to be the cause of anything; 
<A NAME="232"></A>for the theorems of arithmeticians will all be found true even of sensible 
<A NAME="233"></A>things, as was said before.

<A NAME="235"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>"As for those, then, who suppose the Ideas to exist and to be numbers, 
<A NAME="237"></A>by their assumption in virtue of the method of setting out each term apart 
<A NAME="238"></A>from its instances-of the unity of each general term they try at least 
<A NAME="239"></A>to explain somehow why number must exist. Since their reasons, however, 
<A NAME="240"></A>are neither conclusive nor in themselves possible, one must not, for these 
<A NAME="241"></A>reasons at least, assert the existence of number. Again, the Pythagoreans, 
<A NAME="242"></A>because they saw many attributes of numbers belonging te sensible bodies, 
<A NAME="243"></A>supposed real things to be numbers-not separable numbers, however, but 
<A NAME="244"></A>numbers of which real things consist. But why? Because the attributes of 
<A NAME="245"></A>numbers are present in a musical scale and in the heavens and in many other 
<A NAME="246"></A>things. Those, however, who say that mathematical number alone exists cannot 
<A NAME="247"></A>according to their hypotheses say anything of this sort, but it used to 
<A NAME="248"></A>be urged that these sensible things could not be the subject of the sciences. 
<A NAME="249"></A>But we maintain that they are, as we said before. And it is evident that 
<A NAME="250"></A>the objects of mathematics do not exist apart; for if they existed apart 
<A NAME="251"></A>their attributes would not have been present in bodies. Now the Pythagoreans 
<A NAME="252"></A>in this point are open to no objection; but in that they construct natural 
<A NAME="253"></A>bodies out of numbers, things that have lightness and weight out of things 
<A NAME="254"></A>that have not weight or lightness, they seem to speak of another heaven 
<A NAME="255"></A>and other bodies, not of the sensible. But those who make number separable 
<A NAME="256"></A>assume that it both exists and is separable because the axioms would not 
<A NAME="257"></A>be true of sensible things, while the statements of mathematics are true 
<A NAME="258"></A>and 'greet the soul'; and similarly with the spatial magnitudes of mathematics. 
<A NAME="259"></A>It is evident, then, both that the rival theory will say the contrary of 
<A NAME="260"></A>this, and that the difficulty we raised just now, why if numbers are in 
<A NAME="261"></A>no way present in sensible things their attributes are present in sensible 
<A NAME="262"></A>things, has to be solved by those who hold these views. <BR><BR>"There 
<A NAME="263"></A>are some who, because the point is the limit and extreme of the line, the 
<A NAME="264"></A>line of the plane, and the plane of the solid, think there must be real 
<A NAME="265"></A>things of this sort. We must therefore examine this argument too, and see 
<A NAME="266"></A>whether it is not remarkably weak. For (i) extremes are not substances, 
<A NAME="267"></A>but rather all these things are limits. For even walking, and movement 
<A NAME="268"></A>in general, has a limit, so that on their theory this will be a 'this' 
<A NAME="269"></A>and a substance. But that is absurd. Not but what (ii) even if they are 
<A NAME="270"></A>substances, they will all be the substances of the sensible things in this 
<A NAME="271"></A>world; for it is to these that the argument applied. Why then should they 
<A NAME="272"></A>be capable of existing apart? <BR><BR>"Again, if we are not too easily 
<A NAME="273"></A>satisfied, we may, regarding all number and the objects of mathematics, 
<A NAME="274"></A>press this difficulty, that they contribute nothing to one another, the 
<A NAME="275"></A>prior to the posterior; for if number did not exist, none the less spatial 
<A NAME="276"></A>magnitudes would exist for those who maintain the existence of the objects 
<A NAME="277"></A>of mathematics only, and if spatial magnitudes did not exist, soul and 
<A NAME="278"></A>sensible bodies would exist. But the observed facts show that nature is 
<A NAME="279"></A>not a series of episodes, like a bad tragedy. As for the believers in the 
<A NAME="280"></A>Ideas, this difficulty misses them; for they construct spatial magnitudes 
<A NAME="281"></A>out of matter and number, lines out of the number planes doubtless out 
<A NAME="282"></A>of solids out of or they use other numbers, which makes no difference. 
<A NAME="283"></A>But will these magnitudes be Ideas, or what is their manner of existence, 
<A NAME="284"></A>and what do they contribute to things? These contribute nothing, as the 
<A NAME="285"></A>objects of mathematics contribute nothing. But not even is any theorem 
<A NAME="286"></A>true of them, unless we want to change the objects of mathematics and invent 
<A NAME="287"></A>doctrines of our own. But it is not hard to assume any random hypotheses 
<A NAME="288"></A>and spin out a long string of conclusions. These thinkers, then, are wrong 
<A NAME="289"></A>in this way, in wanting to unite the objects of mathematics with the Ideas. 
<A NAME="290"></A>And those who first posited two kinds of number, that of the Forms and 
<A NAME="291"></A>that which is mathematical, neither have said nor can say how mathematical 
<A NAME="292"></A>number is to exist and of what it is to consist. For they place it between 
<A NAME="293"></A>ideal and sensible number. If (i) it consists of the great and small, it 
<A NAME="294"></A>will be the same as the other-ideal-number (he makes spatial magnitudes 
<A NAME="295"></A>out of some other small and great). And if (ii) he names some other element, 
<A NAME="296"></A>he will be making his elements rather many. And if the principle of each 
<A NAME="297"></A>of the two kinds of number is a 1, unity will be something common to these, 
<A NAME="298"></A>and we must inquire how the one is these many things, while at the same 
<A NAME="299"></A>time number, according to him, cannot be generated except from one and 
<A NAME="300"></A>an indefinite dyad. <BR><BR>"All this is absurd, and conflicts both with 
<A NAME="301"></A>itself and with the probabilities, and we seem to see in it Simonides 'long 
<A NAME="302"></A>rigmarole' for the long rigmarole comes into play, like those of slaves, 
<A NAME="303"></A>when men have nothing sound to say. And the very elements-the great and 
<A NAME="304"></A>the small-seem to cry out against the violence that is done to them; for 
<A NAME="305"></A>they cannot in any way generate numbers other than those got from 1 by 
<A NAME="306"></A>doubling. <BR><BR>"It is strange also to attribute generation to things 
<A NAME="307"></A>that are eternal, or rather this is one of the things that are impossible. 
<A NAME="308"></A>There need be no doubt whether the Pythagoreans attribute generation to 
<A NAME="309"></A>them or not; for they say plainly that when the one had been constructed, 
<A NAME="310"></A>whether out of planes or of surface or of seed or of elements which they 
<A NAME="311"></A>cannot express, immediately the nearest part of the unlimited began to 
<A NAME="312"></A>be constrained and limited by the limit. But since they are constructing 
<A NAME="313"></A>a world and wish to speak the language of natural science, it is fair to 
<A NAME="314"></A>make some examination of their physical theorics, but to let them off from 
<A NAME="315"></A>the present inquiry; for we are investigating the principles at work in 
<A NAME="316"></A>unchangeable things, so that it is numbers of this kind whose genesis we 
<A NAME="317"></A>must study.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="318"></A><B>Part 4</B>
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>"These thinkers say there is no generation of the odd number, which 
<A NAME="320"></A>evidently implies that there is generation of the even; and some present 
<A NAME="321"></A>the even as produced first from unequals-the great and the small-when these 
<A NAME="322"></A>are equalized. The inequality, then, must belong to them before they are 
<A NAME="323"></A>equalized. If they had always been equalized, they would not have been 
<A NAME="324"></A>unequal before; for there is nothing before that which is always. Therefore 
<A NAME="325"></A>evidently they are not giving their account of the generation of numbers 
<A NAME="326"></A>merely to assist contemplation of their nature. <BR><BR>"A difficulty, 
<A NAME="327"></A>and a reproach to any one who finds it no difficulty, are contained in 
<A NAME="328"></A>the question how the elements and the principles are related to the good 
<A NAME="329"></A>and the beautiful; the difficulty is this, whether any of the elements 
<A NAME="330"></A>is such a thing as we mean by the good itself and the best, or this is 
<A NAME="331"></A>not so, but these are later in origin than the elements. The theologians 
<A NAME="332"></A>seem to agree with some thinkers of the present day, who answer the question 
<A NAME="333"></A>in the negative, and say that both the good and the beautiful appear in 
<A NAME="334"></A>the nature of things only when that nature has made some progress. (This 
<A NAME="335"></A>they do to avoid a real objection which confronts those who say, as some 
<A NAME="336"></A>do, that the one is a first principle. The objection arises not from their 
<A NAME="337"></A>ascribing goodness to the first principle as an attribute, but from their 
<A NAME="338"></A>making the one a principle-and a principle in the sense of an element-and 
<A NAME="339"></A>generating number from the one.) The old poets agree with this inasmuch 
<A NAME="340"></A>as they say that not those who are first in time, e.g. Night and Heaven 
<A NAME="341"></A>or Chaos or Ocean, reign and rule, but Zeus. These poets, however, are 
<A NAME="342"></A>led to speak thus only because they think of the rulers of the world as 
<A NAME="343"></A>changing; for those of them who combine the two characters in that they 
<A NAME="344"></A>do not use mythical language throughout, e.g. Pherecydes and some others, 
<A NAME="345"></A>make the original generating agent the Best, and so do the Magi, and some 
<A NAME="346"></A>of the later sages also, e.g. both Empedocles and Anaxagoras, of whom one 
<A NAME="347"></A>made love an element, and the other made reason a principle. Of those who 
<A NAME="348"></A>maintain the existence of the unchangeable substances some say the One 
<A NAME="349"></A>itself is the good itself; but they thought its substance lay mainly in 
<A NAME="350"></A>its unity. <BR><BR>"This, then, is the problem,-which of the two ways of 
<A NAME="351"></A>speaking is right. It would be strange if to that which is primary and 
<A NAME="352"></A>eternal and most self-sufficient this very quality--self-sufficiency and 
<A NAME="353"></A>self-maintenance--belongs primarily in some other way than as a good. But 
<A NAME="354"></A>indeed it can be for no other reason indestructible or self-sufficient 
<A NAME="355"></A>than because its nature is good. Therefore to say that the first principle 
<A NAME="356"></A>is good is probably correct; but that this principle should be the One 
<A NAME="357"></A>or, if not that, at least an element, and an element of numbers, is impossible. 
<A NAME="358"></A>Powerful objections arise, to avoid which some have given up the theory 
<A NAME="359"></A>(viz. those who agree that the One is a first principle and element, but 
<A NAME="360"></A>only of mathematical number). For on this view all the units become identical 
<A NAME="361"></A>with species of good, and there is a great profusion of goods. Again, if 
<A NAME="362"></A>the Forms are numbers, all the Forms are identical with species of good. 
<A NAME="363"></A>But let a man assume Ideas of anything he pleases. If these are Ideas only 
<A NAME="364"></A>of goods, the Ideas will not be substances; but if the Ideas are also Ideas 
<A NAME="365"></A>of substances, all animals and plants and all individuals that share in 
<A NAME="366"></A>Ideas will be good. <BR><BR>"These absurdities follow, and it also follows 
<A NAME="367"></A>that the contrary element, whether it is plurality or the unequal, i.e. 
<A NAME="368"></A>the great and small, is the bad-itself. (Hence one thinker avoided attaching 
<A NAME="369"></A>the good to the One, because it would necessarily follow, since generation 
<A NAME="370"></A>is from contraries, that badness is the fundamental nature of plurality; 
<A NAME="371"></A>while others say inequality is the nature of the bad.) It follows, then, 
<A NAME="372"></A>that all things partake of the bad except one--the One itself, and that 
<A NAME="373"></A>numbers partake of it in a more undiluted form than spatial magnitudes, 
<A NAME="374"></A>and that the bad is the space in which the good is realized, and that it 
<A NAME="375"></A>partakes in and desires that which tends to destroy it; for contrary tends 
<A NAME="376"></A>to destroy contrary. And if, as we were saying, the matter is that which 
<A NAME="377"></A>is potentially each thing, e.g. that of actual fire is that which is potentially 
<A NAME="378"></A>fire, the bad will be just the potentially good. <BR><BR>"All these objections, 
<A NAME="379"></A>then, follow, partly because they make every principle an element, partly 
<A NAME="380"></A>because they make contraries principles, partly because they make the One 
<A NAME="381"></A>a principle, partly because they treat the numbers as the first substances, 
<A NAME="382"></A>and as capable of existing apart, and as Forms.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="383"></A><B>Part 5</B>
<A NAME="384"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>"If, then, it is equally impossible not to put the good among the 
<A NAME="386"></A>first principles and to put it among them in this way, evidently the principles 
<A NAME="387"></A>are not being correctly described, nor are the first substances. Nor does 
<A NAME="388"></A>any one conceive the matter correctly if he compares the principles of 
<A NAME="389"></A>the universe to that of animals and plants, on the ground that the more 
<A NAME="390"></A>complete always comes from the indefinite and incomplete-which is what 
<A NAME="391"></A>leads this thinker to say that this is also true of the first principles 
<A NAME="392"></A>of reality, so that the One itself is not even an existing thing. This 
<A NAME="393"></A>is incorrect, for even in this world of animals and plants the principles 
<A NAME="394"></A>from which these come are complete; for it is a man that produces a man, 
<A NAME="395"></A>and the seed is not first. <BR><BR>"It is out of place, also, to generate 
<A NAME="396"></A>place simultaneously with the mathematical solids (for place is peculiar 
<A NAME="397"></A>to the individual things, and hence they are separate in place; but mathematical 
<A NAME="398"></A>objects are nowhere), and to say that they must be somewhere, but not say 
<A NAME="399"></A>what kind of thing their place is. <BR><BR>"Those who say that existing 
<A NAME="400"></A>things come from elements and that the first of existing things are the 
<A NAME="401"></A>numbers, should have first distinguished the senses in which one thing 
<A NAME="402"></A>comes from another, and then said in which sense number comes from its 
<A NAME="403"></A>first principles. <BR><BR>"By intermixture? But (1) not everything is capable 
<A NAME="404"></A>of intermixture, and (2) that which is produced by it is different from 
<A NAME="405"></A>its elements, and on this view the one will not remain separate or a distinct 
<A NAME="406"></A>entity; but they want it to be so. <BR><BR>"By juxtaposition, like a syllable? 
<A NAME="407"></A>But then (1) the elements must have position; and (2) he who thinks of 
<A NAME="408"></A>number will be able to think of the unity and the plurality apart; number 
<A NAME="409"></A>then will be this-a unit and plurality, or the one and the unequal. <BR><BR>"Again, 
<A NAME="410"></A>coming from certain things means in one sense that these are still to be 
<A NAME="411"></A>found in the product, and in another that they are not; which sense does 
<A NAME="412"></A>number come from these elements? Only things that are generated can come 
<A NAME="413"></A>from elements which are present in them. Does number come, then, from its 
<A NAME="414"></A>elements as from seed? But nothing can be excreted from that which is indivisible. 
<A NAME="415"></A>Does it come from its contrary, its contrary not persisting? But all things 
<A NAME="416"></A>that come in this way come also from something else which does persist. 
<A NAME="417"></A>Since, then, one thinker places the 1 as contrary to plurality, and another 
<A NAME="418"></A>places it as contrary to the unequal, treating the 1 as equal, number must 
<A NAME="419"></A>be being treated as coming from contraries. There is, then, something else 
<A NAME="420"></A>that persists, from which and from one contrary the compound is or has 
<A NAME="421"></A>come to be. Again, why in the world do the other things that come from 
<A NAME="422"></A>contraries, or that have contraries, perish (even when all of the contrary 
<A NAME="423"></A>is used to produce them), while number does not? Nothing is said about 
<A NAME="424"></A>this. Yet whether present or not present in the compound the contrary destroys 
<A NAME="425"></A>it, e.g. 'strife' destroys the 'mixture' (yet it should not; for it is 
<A NAME="426"></A>not to that that is contrary). <BR><BR>"Once more, it has not been determined 
<A NAME="427"></A>at all in which way numbers are the causes of substances and of being-whether 
<A NAME="428"></A>(1) as boundaries (as points are of spatial magnitudes). This is how Eurytus 
<A NAME="429"></A>decided what was the number of what (e.g. one of man and another of horse), 
<A NAME="430"></A>viz. by imitating the figures of living things with pebbles, as some people 
<A NAME="431"></A>bring numbers into the forms of triangle and square. Or (2) is it because 
<A NAME="432"></A>harmony is a ratio of numbers, and so is man and everything else? But how 
<A NAME="433"></A>are the attributes-white and sweet and hot-numbers? Evidently it is not 
<A NAME="434"></A>the numbers that are the essence or the causes of the form; for the ratio 
<A NAME="435"></A>is the essence, while the number the causes of the form; for the ratio 
<A NAME="436"></A>is the essence, while the number is the matter. E.g. the essence of flesh 
<A NAME="437"></A>or bone is number only in this way, 'three parts of fire and two of earth'. 
<A NAME="438"></A>And a number, whatever number it is, is always a number of certain things, 
<A NAME="439"></A>either of parts of fire or earth or of units; but the essence is that there 
<A NAME="440"></A>is so much of one thing to so much of another in the mixture; and this 
<A NAME="441"></A>is no longer a number but a ratio of mixture of numbers, whether these 
<A NAME="442"></A>are corporeal or of any other kind. <BR><BR>"Number, then, whether it be 
<A NAME="443"></A>number in general or the number which consists of abstract units, is neither 
<A NAME="444"></A>the cause as agent, nor the matter, nor the ratio and form of things. Nor, 
<A NAME="445"></A>of course, is it the final cause.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="446"></A><B>Part 6</B>
<A NAME="447"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>"One might also raise the question what the good is that things 
<A NAME="449"></A>get from numbers because their composition is expressible by a number, 
<A NAME="450"></A>either by one which is easily calculable or by an odd number. For in fact 
<A NAME="451"></A>honey-water is no more wholesome if it is mixed in the proportion of three 
<A NAME="452"></A>times three, but it would do more good if it were in no particular ratio 
<A NAME="453"></A>but well diluted than if it were numerically expressible but strong. Again, 
<A NAME="454"></A>the ratios of mixtures are expressed by the adding of numbers, not by mere 
<A NAME="455"></A>numbers; e.g. it is 'three parts to two', not 'three times two'. For in 
<A NAME="456"></A>any multiplication the genus of the things multiplied must be the same; 
<A NAME="457"></A>therefore the product 1X2X3 must be measurable by 1, and 4X5X6 by 4 and 
<A NAME="458"></A>therefore all products into which the same factor enters must be measurable 
<A NAME="459"></A>by that factor. The number of fire, then, cannot be 2X5X3X6 and at the 
<A NAME="460"></A>same time that of water 2X3. <BR><BR>"If all things must share in number, 
<A NAME="461"></A>it must follow that many things are the same, and the same number must 
<A NAME="462"></A>belong to one thing and to another. Is number the cause, then, and does 
<A NAME="463"></A>the thing exist because of its number, or is this not certain? E.g. the 
<A NAME="464"></A>motions of the sun have a number, and again those of the moon,-yes, and 
<A NAME="465"></A>the life and prime of each animal. Why, then, should not some of these 
<A NAME="466"></A>numbers be squares, some cubes, and some equal, others double? There is 
<A NAME="467"></A>no reason why they should not, and indeed they must move within these limits, 
<A NAME="468"></A>since all things were assumed to share in number. And it was assumed that 
<A NAME="469"></A>things that differed might fall under the same number. Therefore if the 
<A NAME="470"></A>same number had belonged to certain things, these would have been the same 
<A NAME="471"></A>as one another, since they would have had the same form of number; e.g. 
<A NAME="472"></A>sun and moon would have been the same. But why need these numbers be causes? 
<A NAME="473"></A>There are seven vowels, the scale consists of seven strings, the Pleiades 
<A NAME="474"></A>are seven, at seven animals lose their teeth (at least some do, though 
<A NAME="475"></A>some do not), and the champions who fought against Thebes were seven. Is 
<A NAME="476"></A>it then because the number is the kind of number it is, that the champions 
<A NAME="477"></A>were seven or the Pleiad consists of seven stars? Surely the champions 
<A NAME="478"></A>were seven because there were seven gates or for some other reason, and 
<A NAME="479"></A>the Pleiad we count as seven, as we count the Bear as twelve, while other 
<A NAME="480"></A>peoples count more stars in both. Nay they even say that X, Ps and Z are 
<A NAME="481"></A>concords and that because there are three concords, the double consonants 
<A NAME="482"></A>also are three. They quite neglect the fact that there might be a thousand 
<A NAME="483"></A>such letters; for one symbol might be assigned to GP. But if they say that 
<A NAME="484"></A>each of these three is equal to two of the other letters, and no other 
<A NAME="485"></A>is so, and if the cause is that there are three parts of the mouth and 
<A NAME="486"></A>one letter is in each applied to sigma, it is for this reason that there 
<A NAME="487"></A>are only three, not because the concords are three; since as a matter of 
<A NAME="488"></A>fact the concords are more than three, but of double consonants there cannot 
<A NAME="489"></A>be more. <BR><BR>"These people are like the old-fashioned Homeric scholars, 
<A NAME="490"></A>who see small resemblances but neglect great ones. Some say that there 
<A NAME="491"></A>are many such cases, e.g. that the middle strings are represented by nine 
<A NAME="492"></A>and eight, and that the epic verse has seventeen syllables, which is equal 
<A NAME="493"></A>in number to the two strings, and that the scansion is, in the right half 
<A NAME="494"></A>of the line nine syllables, and in the left eight. And they say that the 
<A NAME="495"></A>distance in the letters from alpha to omega is equal to that from the lowest 
<A NAME="496"></A>note of the flute to the highest, and that the number of this note is equal 
<A NAME="497"></A>to that of the whole choir of heaven. It may be suspected that no one could 
<A NAME="498"></A>find difficulty either in stating such analogies or in finding them in 
<A NAME="499"></A>eternal things, since they can be found even in perishable things. <BR><BR>"But 
<A NAME="500"></A>the lauded characteristics of numbers, and the contraries of these, and 
<A NAME="501"></A>generally the mathematical relations, as some describe them, making them 
<A NAME="502"></A>causes of nature, seem, when we inspect them in this way, to vanish; for 
<A NAME="503"></A>none of them is a cause in any of the senses that have been distinguished 
<A NAME="504"></A>in reference to the first principles. In a sense, however, they make it 
<A NAME="505"></A>plain that goodness belongs to numbers, and that the odd, the straight, 
<A NAME="506"></A>the square, the potencies of certain numbers, are in the column of the 
<A NAME="507"></A>beautiful. For the seasons and a particular kind of number go together; 
<A NAME="508"></A>and the other agreements that they collect from the theorems of mathematics 
<A NAME="509"></A>all have this meaning. Hence they are like coincidences. For they are accidents, 
<A NAME="510"></A>but the things that agree are all appropriate to one another, and one by 
<A NAME="511"></A>analogy. For in each category of being an analogous term is found-as the 
<A NAME="512"></A>straight is in length, so is the level in surface, perhaps the odd in number, 
<A NAME="513"></A>and the white in colour. <BR><BR>"Again, it is not the ideal numbers that 
<A NAME="514"></A>are the causes of musical phenomena and the like (for equal ideal numbers 
<A NAME="515"></A>differ from one another in form; for even the units do); so that we need
