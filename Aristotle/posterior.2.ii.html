<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>The kinds of question we ask are as many as the kinds of things which we 
<A NAME="12"></A>know. They are in fact four:-(1) whether the connexion of an attribute 
<A NAME="13"></A>with a thing is a fact, (2) what is the reason of the connexion, (3) whether 
<A NAME="14"></A>a thing exists, (4) What is the nature of the thing. Thus, when our question 
<A NAME="15"></A>concerns a complex of thing and attribute and we ask whether the thing 
<A NAME="16"></A>is thus or otherwise qualified-whether, e.g. the sun suffers eclipse or 
<A NAME="17"></A>not-then we are asking as to the fact of a connexion. That our inquiry 
<A NAME="18"></A>ceases with the discovery that the sun does suffer eclipse is an indication 
<A NAME="19"></A>of this; and if we know from the start that the sun suffers eclipse, we 
<A NAME="20"></A>do not inquire whether it does so or not. On the other hand, when we know 
<A NAME="21"></A>the fact we ask the reason; as, for example, when we know that the sun 
<A NAME="22"></A>is being eclipsed and that an earthquake is in progress, it is the reason 
<A NAME="23"></A>of eclipse or earthquake into which we inquire.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>Where a complex is concerned, then, those are the two questions 
<A NAME="25"></A>we ask; but for some objects of inquiry we have a different kind of question 
<A NAME="26"></A>to ask, such as whether there is or is not a centaur or a God. (By 'is 
<A NAME="27"></A>or is not' I mean 'is or is not, without further qualification'; as opposed 
<A NAME="28"></A>to 'is or is not [e.g.] white'.) On the other hand, when we have ascertained 
<A NAME="29"></A>the thing's existence, we inquire as to its nature, asking, for instance, 
<A NAME="30"></A>'what, then, is God?' or 'what is man?'.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="31"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>These, then, are the four kinds of question we ask, and it is in 
<A NAME="33"></A>the answers to these questions that our knowledge consists.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>Now when we ask whether a connexion is a fact, or whether a thing 
<A NAME="35"></A>without qualification is, we are really asking whether the connexion or 
<A NAME="36"></A>the thing has a 'middle'; and when we have ascertained either that the 
<A NAME="37"></A>connexion is a fact or that the thing is-i.e. ascertained either the partial 
<A NAME="38"></A>or the unqualified being of the thing-and are proceeding to ask the reason 
<A NAME="39"></A>of the connexion or the nature of the thing, then we are asking what the 
<A NAME="40"></A>'middle' is.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>(By distinguishing the fact of the connexion and the existence 
<A NAME="42"></A>of the thing as respectively the partial and the unqualified being of the 
<A NAME="43"></A>thing, I mean that if we ask 'does the moon suffer eclipse?', or 'does 
<A NAME="44"></A>the moon wax?', the question concerns a part of the thing's being; for 
<A NAME="45"></A>what we are asking in such questions is whether a thing is this or that, 
<A NAME="46"></A>i.e. has or has not this or that attribute: whereas, if we ask whether 
<A NAME="47"></A>the moon or night exists, the question concerns the unqualified being of 
<A NAME="48"></A>a thing.)
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>We conclude that in all our inquiries we are asking either whether 
<A NAME="50"></A>there is a 'middle' or what the 'middle' is: for the 'middle' here is precisely 
<A NAME="51"></A>the cause, and it is the cause that we seek in all our inquiries. Thus, 
<A NAME="52"></A>'Does the moon suffer eclipse?' means 'Is there or is there not a cause 
<A NAME="53"></A>producing eclipse of the moon?', and when we have learnt that there is, 
<A NAME="54"></A>our next question is, 'What, then, is this cause? for the cause through 
<A NAME="55"></A>which a thing is-not is this or that, i.e. has this or that attribute, 
<A NAME="56"></A>but without qualification is-and the cause through which it is-not is without 
<A NAME="57"></A>qualification, but is this or that as having some essential attribute or 
<A NAME="58"></A>some accident-are both alike the middle'. By that which is without qualification 
<A NAME="59"></A>I mean the subject, e.g. moon or earth or sun or triangle; by that which 
<A NAME="60"></A>a subject is (in the partial sense) I mean a property, e.g. eclipse, equality 
<A NAME="61"></A>or inequality, interposition or non-interposition. For in all these examples 
<A NAME="62"></A>it is clear that the nature of the thing and the reason of the fact are 
<A NAME="63"></A>identical: the question 'What is eclipse?' and its answer 'The privation 
<A NAME="64"></A>of the moon's light by the interposition of the earth' are identical with 
<A NAME="65"></A>the question 'What is the reason of eclipse?' or 'Why does the moon suffer 
<A NAME="66"></A>eclipse?' and the reply 'Because of the failure of light through the earth's 
<A NAME="67"></A>shutting it out'. Again, for 'What is a concord? A commensurate numerical 
<A NAME="68"></A>ratio of a high and a low note', we may substitute 'What ratio makes a 
<A NAME="69"></A>high and a low note concordant? Their relation according to a commensurate 
<A NAME="70"></A>numerical ratio.' 'Are the high and the low note concordant?' is equivalent 
<A NAME="71"></A>to 'Is their ratio commensurate?'; and when we find that it is commensurate, 
<A NAME="72"></A>we ask 'What, then, is their ratio?'.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Cases in which the 'middle' is sensible show that the object of 
<A NAME="74"></A>our inquiry is always the 'middle': we inquire, because we have not perceived 
<A NAME="75"></A>it, whether there is or is not a 'middle' causing, e.g. an eclipse. On 
<A NAME="76"></A>the other hand, if we were on the moon we should not be inquiring either 
<A NAME="77"></A>as to the fact or the reason, but both fact and reason would be obvious 
<A NAME="78"></A>simultaneously. For the act of perception would have enabled us to know 
<A NAME="79"></A>the universal too; since, the present fact of an eclipse being evident, 
<A NAME="80"></A>perception would then at the same time give us the present fact of the 
<A NAME="81"></A>earth's screening the sun's light, and from this would arise the 
<A NAME="82"></A>universal.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>Thus, as we maintain, to know a thing's nature is to know the reason 
<A NAME="84"></A>why it is; and this is equally true of things in so far as they are said 
<A NAME="85"></A>without qualification to he as opposed to being possessed of some attribute, 
<A NAME="86"></A>and in so far as they are said to be possessed of some attribute such as 
<A NAME="87"></A>equal to right angles, or greater or less.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="88"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>It is clear, then, that all questions are a search for a 'middle'. 
<A NAME="90"></A>Let us now state how essential nature is revealed and in what way it can 
<A NAME="91"></A>be reduced to demonstration; what definition is, and what things are definable. 
<A NAME="92"></A>And let us first discuss certain difficulties which these questions raise, 
<A NAME="93"></A>beginning what we have to say with a point most intimately connected with 
<A NAME="94"></A>our immediately preceding remarks, namely the doubt that might be felt 
<A NAME="95"></A>as to whether or not it is possible to know the same thing in the same 
<A NAME="96"></A>relation, both by definition and by demonstration. It might, I mean, be 
<A NAME="97"></A>urged that definition is held to concern essential nature and is in every 
<A NAME="98"></A>case universal and affirmative; whereas, on the other hand, some conclusions 
<A NAME="99"></A>are negative and some are not universal; e.g. all in the second figure 
<A NAME="100"></A>are negative, none in the third are universal. And again, not even all 
<A NAME="101"></A>affirmative conclusions in the first figure are definable, e.g. 'every 
<A NAME="102"></A>triangle has its angles equal to two right angles'. An argument proving 
<A NAME="103"></A>this difference between demonstration and definition is that to have scientific 
<A NAME="104"></A>knowledge of the demonstrable is identical with possessing a demonstration 
<A NAME="105"></A>of it: hence if demonstration of such conclusions as these is possible, 
<A NAME="106"></A>there clearly cannot also be definition of them. If there could, one might 
<A NAME="107"></A>know such a conclusion also in virtue of its definition without possessing 
<A NAME="108"></A>the demonstration of it; for there is nothing to stop our having the one 
<A NAME="109"></A>without the other.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>Induction too will sufficiently convince us of this difference; 
<A NAME="111"></A>for never yet by defining anything-essential attribute or accident-did 
<A NAME="112"></A>we get knowledge of it. Again, if to define is to acquire knowledge of 
<A NAME="113"></A>a substance, at any rate such attributes are not substances.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>It is evident, then, that not everything demonstrable can be defined. 
<A NAME="115"></A>What then? Can everything definable be demonstrated, or not? There is one 
<A NAME="116"></A>of our previous arguments which covers this too. Of a single thing qua 
<A NAME="117"></A>single there is a single scientific knowledge. Hence, since to know the 
<A NAME="118"></A>demonstrable scientifically is to possess the demonstration of it, an impossible 
<A NAME="119"></A>consequence will follow:-possession of its definition without its demonstration 
<A NAME="120"></A>will give knowledge of the demonstrable.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, the basic premisses of demonstrations are definitions, 
<A NAME="122"></A>and it has already been shown that these will be found indemonstrable; 
<A NAME="123"></A>either the basic premisses will be demonstrable and will depend on prior 
<A NAME="124"></A>premisses, and the regress will be endless; or the primary truths will 
<A NAME="125"></A>be indemonstrable definitions.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>But if the definable and the demonstrable are not wholly the same, 
<A NAME="127"></A>may they yet be partially the same? Or is that impossible, because there 
<A NAME="128"></A>can be no demonstration of the definable? There can be none, because definition 
<A NAME="129"></A>is of the essential nature or being of something, and all demonstrations 
<A NAME="130"></A>evidently posit and assume the essential nature-mathematical demonstrations, 
<A NAME="131"></A>for example, the nature of unity and the odd, and all the other sciences 
<A NAME="132"></A>likewise. Moreover, every demonstration proves a predicate of a subject 
<A NAME="133"></A>as attaching or as not attaching to it, but in definition one thing is 
<A NAME="134"></A>not predicated of another; we do not, e.g. predicate animal of biped nor 
<A NAME="135"></A>biped of animal, nor yet figure of plane-plane not being figure nor figure 
<A NAME="136"></A>plane. Again, to prove essential nature is not the same as to prove the 
<A NAME="137"></A>fact of a connexion. Now definition reveals essential nature, demonstration 
<A NAME="138"></A>reveals that a given attribute attaches or does not attach to a given subject; 
<A NAME="139"></A>but different things require different demonstrations-unless the one demonstration 
<A NAME="140"></A>is related to the other as part to whole. I add this because if all triangles 
<A NAME="141"></A>have been proved to possess angles equal to two right angles, then this 
<A NAME="142"></A>attribute has been proved to attach to isosceles; for isosceles is a part 
<A NAME="143"></A>of which all triangles constitute the whole. But in the case before us 
<A NAME="144"></A>the fact and the essential nature are not so related to one another, since 
<A NAME="145"></A>the one is not a part of the other.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>So it emerges that not all the definable is demonstrable nor all 
<A NAME="147"></A>the demonstrable definable; and we may draw the general conclusion that 
<A NAME="148"></A>there is no identical object of which it is possible to possess both a 
<A NAME="149"></A>definition and a demonstration. It follows obviously that definition and 
<A NAME="150"></A>demonstration are neither identical nor contained either within the other: 
<A NAME="151"></A>if they were, their objects would be related either as identical or as 
<A NAME="152"></A>whole and part.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="153"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>So much, then, for the first stage of our problem. The next step 
<A NAME="155"></A>is to raise the question whether syllogism-i.e. demonstration-of the definable 
<A NAME="156"></A>nature is possible or, as our recent argument assumed, 
<A NAME="157"></A>impossible.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>We might argue it impossible on the following grounds:-(a) syllogism 
<A NAME="159"></A>proves an attribute of a subject through the middle term; on the other 
<A NAME="160"></A>hand (b) its definable nature is both 'peculiar' to a subject and predicated 
<A NAME="161"></A>of it as belonging to its essence. But in that case (1) the subject, its 
<A NAME="162"></A>definition, and the middle term connecting them must be reciprocally predicable 
<A NAME="163"></A>of one another; for if A is to C, obviously A is 'peculiar' to B and B 
<A NAME="164"></A>to C-in fact all three terms are 'peculiar' to one another: and further 
<A NAME="165"></A>(2) if A inheres in the essence of all B and B is predicated universally 
<A NAME="166"></A>of all C as belonging to C's essence, A also must be predicated of C as 
<A NAME="167"></A>belonging to its essence.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>If one does not take this relation as thus duplicated-if, that 
<A NAME="169"></A>is, A is predicated as being of the essence of B, but B is not of the essence 
<A NAME="170"></A>of the subjects of which it is predicated-A will not necessarily be predicated 
<A NAME="171"></A>of C as belonging to its essence. So both premisses will predicate essence, 
<A NAME="172"></A>and consequently B also will be predicated of C as its essence. Since, 
<A NAME="173"></A>therefore, both premisses do predicate essence-i.e. definable form-C's 
<A NAME="174"></A>definable form will appear in the middle term before the conclusion is 
<A NAME="175"></A>drawn.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>We may generalize by supposing that it is possible to prove the 
<A NAME="177"></A>essential nature of man. Let C be man, A man's essential nature--two-footed 
<A NAME="178"></A>animal, or aught else it may be. Then, if we are to syllogize, A must be 
<A NAME="179"></A>predicated of all B. But this premiss will be mediated by a fresh definition, 
<A NAME="180"></A>which consequently will also be the essential nature of man. Therefore 
<A NAME="181"></A>the argument assumes what it has to prove, since B too is the essential 
<A NAME="182"></A>nature of man. It is, however, the case in which there are only the two 
<A NAME="183"></A>premisses-i.e. in which the premisses are primary and immediate-which we 
<A NAME="184"></A>ought to investigate, because it best illustrates the point under 
<A NAME="185"></A>discussion.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>Thus they who prove the essential nature of soul or man or anything 
<A NAME="187"></A>else through reciprocating terms beg the question. It would be begging 
<A NAME="188"></A>the question, for example, to contend that the soul is that which causes 
<A NAME="189"></A>its own life, and that what causes its own life is a self-moving number; 
<A NAME="190"></A>for one would have to postulate that the soul is a self-moving number in 
<A NAME="191"></A>the sense of being identical with it. For if A is predicable as a mere 
<A NAME="192"></A>consequent of B and B of C, A will not on that account be the definable 
<A NAME="193"></A>form of C: A will merely be what it was true to say of C. Even if A is 
<A NAME="194"></A>predicated of all B inasmuch as B is identical with a species of A, still 
<A NAME="195"></A>it will not follow: being an animal is predicated of being a man-since 
<A NAME="196"></A>it is true that in all instances to be human is to be animal, just as it 
<A NAME="197"></A>is also true that every man is an animal-but not as identical with being 
<A NAME="198"></A>man.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>We conclude, then, that unless one takes both the premisses as 
<A NAME="200"></A>predicating essence, one cannot infer that A is the definable form and 
<A NAME="201"></A>essence of C: but if one does so take them, in assuming B one will have 
<A NAME="202"></A>assumed, before drawing the conclusion, what the definable form of C is; 
<A NAME="203"></A>so that there has been no inference, for one has begged the 
<A NAME="204"></A>question.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="205"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>Nor, as was said in my formal logic, is the method of division 
<A NAME="207"></A>a process of inference at all, since at no point does the characterization 
<A NAME="208"></A>of the subject follow necessarily from the premising of certain other facts: 
<A NAME="209"></A>division demonstrates as little as does induction. For in a genuine demonstration 
<A NAME="210"></A>the conclusion must not be put as a question nor depend on a concession, 
<A NAME="211"></A>but must follow necessarily from its premisses, even if the respondent 
<A NAME="212"></A>deny it. The definer asks 'Is man animal or inanimate?' and then assumes-he 
<A NAME="213"></A>has not inferred-that man is animal. Next, when presented with an exhaustive 
<A NAME="214"></A>division of animal into terrestrial and aquatic, he assumes that man is 
<A NAME="215"></A>terrestrial. Moreover, that man is the complete formula, terrestrial-animal, 
<A NAME="216"></A>does not follow necessarily from the premisses: this too is an assumption, 
<A NAME="217"></A>and equally an assumption whether the division comprises many differentiae 
<A NAME="218"></A>or few. (Indeed as this method of division is used by those who proceed 
<A NAME="219"></A>by it, even truths that can be inferred actually fail to appear as such.) 
<A NAME="220"></A>For why should not the whole of this formula be true of man, and yet not 
<A NAME="221"></A>exhibit his essential nature or definable form? Again, what guarantee is 
<A NAME="222"></A>there against an unessential addition, or against the omission of the final 
<A NAME="223"></A>or of an intermediate determinant of the substantial 
<A NAME="224"></A>being?
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>The champion of division might here urge that though these lapses 
<A NAME="226"></A>do occur, yet we can solve that difficulty if all the attributes we assume 
<A NAME="227"></A>are constituents of the definable form, and if, postulating the genus, 
<A NAME="228"></A>we produce by division the requisite uninterrupted sequence of terms, and 
<A NAME="229"></A>omit nothing; and that indeed we cannot fail to fulfil these conditions 
<A NAME="230"></A>if what is to be divided falls whole into the division at each stage, and 
<A NAME="231"></A>none of it is omitted; and that this-the dividendum-must without further 
<A NAME="232"></A>question be (ultimately) incapable of fresh specific division. Nevertheless, 
<A NAME="233"></A>we reply, division does not involve inference; if it gives knowledge, it 
<A NAME="234"></A>gives it in another way. Nor is there any absurdity in this: induction, 
<A NAME="235"></A>perhaps, is not demonstration any more than is division, et it does make 
<A NAME="236"></A>evident some truth. Yet to state a definition reached by division is not 
<A NAME="237"></A>to state a conclusion: as, when conclusions are drawn without their appropriate 
<A NAME="238"></A>middles, the alleged necessity by which the inference follows from the 
<A NAME="239"></A>premisses is open to a question as to the reason for it, so definitions 
<A NAME="240"></A>reached by division invite the same question.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>Thus to the question 'What is the essential nature of man?' the 
<A NAME="242"></A>divider replies 'Animal, mortal, footed, biped, wingless'; and when at 
<A NAME="243"></A>each step he is asked 'Why?', he will say, and, as he thinks, proves by 
<A NAME="244"></A>division, that all animal is mortal or immortal: but such a formula taken 
<A NAME="245"></A>in its entirety is not definition; so that even if division does demonstrate 
<A NAME="246"></A>its formula, definition at any rate does not turn out to be a conclusion 
<A NAME="247"></A>of inference.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="248"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>Can we nevertheless actually demonstrate what a thing essentially 
<A NAME="250"></A>and substantially is, but hypothetically, i.e. by premising (1) that its 
<A NAME="251"></A>definable form is constituted by the 'peculiar' attributes of its essential 
<A NAME="252"></A>nature; (2) that such and such are the only attributes of its essential 
<A NAME="253"></A>nature, and that the complete synthesis of them is peculiar to the thing; 
<A NAME="254"></A>and thus-since in this synthesis consists the being of the thing-obtaining 
<A NAME="255"></A>our conclusion? Or is the truth that, since proof must be through the middle 
<A NAME="256"></A>term, the definable form is once more assumed in this minor premiss 
<A NAME="257"></A>too?
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>Further, just as in syllogizing we do not premise what syllogistic 
<A NAME="259"></A>inference is (since the premisses from which we conclude must be related 
<A NAME="260"></A>as whole and part), so the definable form must not fall within the syllogism 
<A NAME="261"></A>but remain outside the premisses posited. It is only against a doubt as 
<A NAME="262"></A>to its having been a syllogistic inference at all that we have to defend 
<A NAME="263"></A>our argument as conforming to the definition of syllogism. It is only when 
<A NAME="264"></A>some one doubts whether the conclusion proved is the definable form that 
<A NAME="265"></A>we have to defend it as conforming to the definition of definable form 
<A NAME="266"></A>which we assumed. Hence syllogistic inference must be possible even without 
<A NAME="267"></A>the express statement of what syllogism is or what definable form 
<A NAME="268"></A>is.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>The following type of hypothetical proof also begs the question. 
<A NAME="270"></A>If evil is definable as the divisible, and the definition of a thing's 
<A NAME="271"></A>contrary-if it has one the contrary of the thing's definition; then, if 
<A NAME="272"></A>good is the contrary of evil and the indivisible of the divisible, we conclude 
<A NAME="273"></A>that to be good is essentially to be indivisible. The question is begged 
<A NAME="274"></A>because definable form is assumed as a premiss, and as a premiss which 
<A NAME="275"></A>is to prove definable form. 'But not the same definable form', you may 
<A NAME="276"></A>object. That I admit, for in demonstrations also we premise that 'this' 
<A NAME="277"></A>is predicable of 'that'; but in this premiss the term we assert of the 
<A NAME="278"></A>minor is neither the major itself nor a term identical in definition, or 
<A NAME="279"></A>convertible, with the major.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>Again, both proof by division and the syllogism just described 
<A NAME="281"></A>are open to the question why man should be animal-biped-terrestrial and 
<A NAME="282"></A>not merely animal and terrestrial, since what they premise does not ensure 
<A NAME="283"></A>that the predicates shall constitute a genuine unity and not merely belong 
<A NAME="284"></A>to a single subject as do musical and grammatical when predicated of the 
<A NAME="285"></A>same man.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="286"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>How then by definition shall we prove substance or essential nature? 
<A NAME="288"></A>We cannot show it as a fresh fact necessarily following from the assumption 
<A NAME="289"></A>of premisses admitted to be facts-the method of demonstration: we may not 
<A NAME="290"></A>proceed as by induction to establish a universal on the evidence of groups 
<A NAME="291"></A>of particulars which offer no exception, because induction proves not what 
<A NAME="292"></A>the essential nature of a thing is but that it has or has not some attribute. 
<A NAME="293"></A>Therefore, since presumably one cannot prove essential nature by an appeal 
<A NAME="294"></A>to sense perception or by pointing with the finger, what other method 
<A NAME="295"></A>remains?
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>To put it another way: how shall we by definition prove essential 
<A NAME="297"></A>nature? He who knows what human-or any other-nature is, must know also 
<A NAME="298"></A>that man exists; for no one knows the nature of what does not exist-one 
<A NAME="299"></A>can know the meaning of the phrase or name 'goat-stag' but not what the 
<A NAME="300"></A>essential nature of a goat-stag is. But further, if definition can prove 
<A NAME="301"></A>what is the essential nature of a thing, can it also prove that it exists? 
<A NAME="302"></A>And how will it prove them both by the same process, since definition exhibits 
<A NAME="303"></A>one single thing and demonstration another single thing, and what human 
<A NAME="304"></A>nature is and the fact that man exists are not the same thing? Then too 
<A NAME="305"></A>we hold that it is by demonstration that the being of everything must be 
<A NAME="306"></A>proved-unless indeed to be were its essence; and, since being is not a 
<A NAME="307"></A>genus, it is not the essence of anything. Hence the being of anything as 
<A NAME="308"></A>fact is matter for demonstration; and this is the actual procedure of the 
<A NAME="309"></A>sciences, for the geometer assumes the meaning of the word triangle, but 
<A NAME="310"></A>that it is possessed of some attribute he proves. What is it, then, that 
<A NAME="311"></A>we shall prove in defining essential nature? Triangle? In that case a man 
<A NAME="312"></A>will know by definition what a thing's nature is without knowing whether 
<A NAME="313"></A>it exists. But that is impossible.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>Moreover it is clear, if we consider the methods of defining actually 
<A NAME="315"></A>in use, that definition does not prove that the thing defined exists: since 
<A NAME="316"></A>even if there does actually exist something which is equidistant from a 
<A NAME="317"></A>centre, yet why should the thing named in the definition exist? Why, in 
<A NAME="318"></A>other words, should this be the formula defining circle? One might equally 
<A NAME="319"></A>well call it the definition of mountain copper. For definitions do not 
<A NAME="320"></A>carry a further guarantee that the thing defined can exist or that it is 
<A NAME="321"></A>what they claim to define: one can always ask why.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>Since, therefore, to define is to prove either a thing's essential 
<A NAME="323"></A>nature or the meaning of its name, we may conclude that definition, if 
<A NAME="324"></A>it in no sense proves essential nature, is a set of words signifying precisely 
<A NAME="325"></A>what a name signifies. But that were a strange consequence; for (1) both 
<A NAME="326"></A>what is not substance and what does not exist at all would be definable, 
<A NAME="327"></A>since even non-existents can be signified by a name: (2) all sets of words 
<A NAME="328"></A>or sentences would be definitions, since any kind of sentence could be 
<A NAME="329"></A>given a name; so that we should all be talking in definitions, and even 
<A NAME="330"></A>the Iliad would be a definition: (3) no demonstration can prove that any 
<A NAME="331"></A>particular name means any particular thing: neither, therefore, do definitions, 
<A NAME="332"></A>in addition to revealing the meaning of a name, also reveal that the name 
<A NAME="333"></A>has this meaning. It appears then from these considerations that neither 
<A NAME="334"></A>definition and syllogism nor their objects are identical, and further that 
<A NAME="335"></A>definition neither demonstrates nor proves anything, and that knowledge 
<A NAME="336"></A>of essential nature is not to be obtained either by definition or by 
<A NAME="337"></A>demonstration.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="338"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>We must now start afresh and consider which of these conclusions 
<A NAME="340"></A>are sound and which are not, and what is the nature of definition, and 
<A NAME="341"></A>whether essential nature is in any sense demonstrable and definable or 
<A NAME="342"></A>in none.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>Now to know its essential nature is, as we said, the same as to 
<A NAME="344"></A>know the cause of a thing's existence, and the proof of this depends on 
<A NAME="345"></A>the fact that a thing must have a cause. Moreover, this cause is either 
<A NAME="346"></A>identical with the essential nature of the thing or distinct from it; and 
<A NAME="347"></A>if its cause is distinct from it, the essential nature of the thing is 
<A NAME="348"></A>either demonstrable or indemonstrable. Consequently, if the cause is distinct 
<A NAME="349"></A>from the thing's essential nature and demonstration is possible, the cause 
<A NAME="350"></A>must be the middle term, and, the conclusion proved being universal and 
<A NAME="351"></A>affirmative, the proof is in the first figure. So the method just examined 
<A NAME="352"></A>of proving it through another essential nature would be one way of proving 
<A NAME="353"></A>essential nature, because a conclusion containing essential nature must 
<A NAME="354"></A>be inferred through a middle which is an essential nature just as a 'peculiar' 
<A NAME="355"></A>property must be inferred through a middle which is a 'peculiar' property; 
<A NAME="356"></A>so that of the two definable natures of a single thing this method will 
<A NAME="357"></A>prove one and not the other.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>Now it was said before that this method could not amount to demonstration 
<A NAME="359"></A>of essential nature-it is actually a dialectical proof of it-so let us 
<A NAME="360"></A>begin again and explain by what method it can be demonstrated. When we 
<A NAME="361"></A>are aware of a fact we seek its reason, and though sometimes the fact and 
<A NAME="362"></A>the reason dawn on us simultaneously, yet we cannot apprehend the reason 
<A NAME="363"></A>a moment sooner than the fact; and clearly in just the same way we cannot 
<A NAME="364"></A>apprehend a thing's definable form without apprehending that it exists, 
<A NAME="365"></A>since while we are ignorant whether it exists we cannot know its essential 
<A NAME="366"></A>nature. Moreover we are aware whether a thing exists or not sometimes through 
<A NAME="367"></A>apprehending an element in its character, and sometimes accidentally, as, 
<A NAME="368"></A>for example, when we are aware of thunder as a noise in the clouds, of 
<A NAME="369"></A>eclipse as a privation of light, or of man as some species of animal, or 
<A NAME="370"></A>of the soul as a self-moving thing. As often as we have accidental knowledge 
<A NAME="371"></A>that the thing exists, we must be in a wholly negative state as regards 
<A NAME="372"></A>awareness of its essential nature; for we have not got genuine knowledge 
<A NAME="373"></A>even of its existence, and to search for a thing's essential nature when 
<A NAME="374"></A>we are unaware that it exists is to search for nothing. On the other hand, 
<A NAME="375"></A>whenever we apprehend an element in the thing's character there is less 
<A NAME="376"></A>difficulty. Thus it follows that the degree of our knowledge of a thing's 
<A NAME="377"></A>essential nature is determined by the sense in which we are aware that 
<A NAME="378"></A>it exists. Let us then take the following as our first instance of being 
<A NAME="379"></A>aware of an element in the essential nature. Let A be eclipse, C the moon, 
<A NAME="380"></A>B the earth's acting as a screen. Now to ask whether the moon is eclipsed 
<A NAME="381"></A>or not is to ask whether or not B has occurred. But that is precisely the 
<A NAME="382"></A>same as asking whether A has a defining condition; and if this condition 
<A NAME="383"></A>actually exists, we assert that A also actually exists. Or again we may 
<A NAME="384"></A>ask which side of a contradiction the defining condition necessitates: 
<A NAME="385"></A>does it make the angles of a triangle equal or not equal to two right angles? 
<A NAME="386"></A>When we have found the answer, if the premisses are immediate, we know 
<A NAME="387"></A>fact and reason together; if they are not immediate, we know the fact without 
<A NAME="388"></A>the reason, as in the following example: let C be the moon, A eclipse, 
<A NAME="389"></A>B the fact that the moon fails to produce shadows though she is full and 
<A NAME="390"></A>though no visible body intervenes between us and her. Then if B, failure 
<A NAME="391"></A>to produce shadows in spite of the absence of an intervening body, is attributable 
<A NAME="392"></A>A to C, and eclipse, is attributable to B, it is clear that the moon is 
<A NAME="393"></A>eclipsed, but the reason why is not yet clear, and we know that eclipse 
<A NAME="394"></A>exists, but we do not know what its essential nature is. But when it is 
<A NAME="395"></A>clear that A is attributable to C and we proceed to ask the reason of this 
<A NAME="396"></A>fact, we are inquiring what is the nature of B: is it the earth's acting 
<A NAME="397"></A>as a screen, or the moon's rotation or her extinction? But B is the definition 
<A NAME="398"></A>of the other term, viz. in these examples, of the major term A; for eclipse 
<A NAME="399"></A>is constituted by the earth acting as a screen. Thus, (1) 'What is thunder?' 
<A NAME="400"></A>'The quenching of fire in cloud', and (2) 'Why does it thunder?' 'Because 
<A NAME="401"></A>fire is quenched in the cloud', are equivalent. Let C be cloud, A thunder, 
<A NAME="402"></A>B the quenching of fire. Then B is attributable to C, cloud, since fire 
<A NAME="403"></A>is quenched in it; and A, noise, is attributable to B; and B is assuredly 
<A NAME="404"></A>the definition of the major term A. If there be a further mediating cause 
<A NAME="405"></A>of B, it will be one of the remaining partial definitions of 
<A NAME="406"></A>A.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>We have stated then how essential nature is discovered and becomes 
<A NAME="408"></A>known, and we see that, while there is no syllogism-i.e. no demonstrative 
<A NAME="409"></A>syllogism-of essential nature, yet it is through syllogism, viz. demonstrative 
<A NAME="410"></A>syllogism, that essential nature is exhibited. So we conclude that neither 
<A NAME="411"></A>can the essential nature of anything which has a cause distinct from itself 
<A NAME="412"></A>be known without demonstration, nor can it be demonstrated; and this is 
<A NAME="413"></A>what we contended in our preliminary discussions.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="414"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>Now while some things have a cause distinct from themselves, others 
<A NAME="416"></A>have not. Hence it is evident that there are essential natures which are 
<A NAME="417"></A>immediate, that is are basic premisses; and of these not only that they 
<A NAME="418"></A>are but also what they are must be assumed or revealed in some other way. 
<A NAME="419"></A>This too is the actual procedure of the arithmetician, who assumes both 
<A NAME="420"></A>the nature and the existence of unit. On the other hand, it is possible 
<A NAME="421"></A>(in the manner explained) to exhibit through demonstration the essential 
<A NAME="422"></A>nature of things which have a 'middle', i.e. a cause of their substantial 
<A NAME="423"></A>being other than that being itself; but we do not thereby demonstrate 
<A NAME="424"></A>it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="425"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>Since definition is said to be the statement of a thing's nature, 
<A NAME="427"></A>obviously one kind of definition will be a statement of the meaning of 
<A NAME="428"></A>the name, or of an equivalent nominal formula. A definition in this sense 
<A NAME="429"></A>tells you, e.g. the meaning of the phrase 'triangular character'. When 
<A NAME="430"></A>we are aware that triangle exists, we inquire the reason why it exists. 
<A NAME="431"></A>But it is difficult thus to learn the definition of things the existence 
<A NAME="432"></A>of which we do not genuinely know-the cause of this difficulty being, as 
<A NAME="433"></A>we said before, that we only know accidentally whether or not the thing 
<A NAME="434"></A>exists. Moreover, a statement may be a unity in either of two ways, by 
<A NAME="435"></A>conjunction, like the Iliad, or because it exhibits a single predicate 
<A NAME="436"></A>as inhering not accidentally in a single subject.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>That then is one way of defining definition. Another kind of definition 
<A NAME="438"></A>is a formula exhibiting the cause of a thing's existence. Thus the former 
<A NAME="439"></A>signifies without proving, but the latter will clearly be a quasi-demonstration 
<A NAME="440"></A>of essential nature, differing from demonstration in the arrangement of 
<A NAME="441"></A>its terms. For there is a difference between stating why it thunders, and 
<A NAME="442"></A>stating what is the essential nature of thunder; since the first statement 
<A NAME="443"></A>will be 'Because fire is quenched in the clouds', while the statement of 
<A NAME="444"></A>what the nature of thunder is will be 'The noise of fire being quenched 
<A NAME="445"></A>in the clouds'. Thus the same statement takes a different form: in one 
<A NAME="446"></A>form it is continuous demonstration, in the other definition. Again, thunder 
<A NAME="447"></A>can be defined as noise in the clouds, which is the conclusion of the demonstration 
<A NAME="448"></A>embodying essential nature. On the other hand the definition of immediates 
<A NAME="449"></A>is an indemonstrable positing of essential nature.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>We conclude then that definition is (a) an indemonstrable statement 
<A NAME="451"></A>of essential nature, or (b) a syllogism of essential nature differing from 
<A NAME="452"></A>demonstration in grammatical form, or (c) the conclusion of a demonstration 
<A NAME="453"></A>giving essential nature.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>Our discussion has therefore made plain (1) in what sense and of 
<A NAME="455"></A>what things the essential nature is demonstrable, and in what sense and 
<A NAME="456"></A>of what things it is not; (2) what are the various meanings of the term 
<A NAME="457"></A>definition, and in what sense and of what things it proves the essential 
<A NAME="458"></A>nature, and in what sense and of what things it does not; (3) what is the 
<A NAME="459"></A>relation of definition to demonstration, and how far the same thing is 
<A NAME="460"></A>both definable and demonstrable and how far it is not.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="461"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR>We think we have scientific knowledge when we know the cause, and 
<A NAME="463"></A>there are four causes: (1) the definable form, (2) an antecedent which 
<A NAME="464"></A>necessitates a consequent, (3) the efficient cause, (4) the final cause. 
<A NAME="465"></A>Hence each of these can be the middle term of a proof, for (a) though the 
<A NAME="466"></A>inference from antecedent to necessary consequent does not hold if only 
<A NAME="467"></A>one premiss is assumed-two is the minimum-still when there are two it holds 
<A NAME="468"></A>on condition that they have a single common middle term. So it is from 
<A NAME="469"></A>the assumption of this single middle term that the conclusion follows necessarily. 
<A NAME="470"></A>The following example will also show this. Why is the angle in a semicircle 
<A NAME="471"></A>a right angle?-or from what assumption does it follow that it is a right 
<A NAME="472"></A>angle? Thus, let A be right angle, B the half of two right angles, C the 
<A NAME="473"></A>angle in a semicircle. Then B is the cause in virtue of which A, right 
<A NAME="474"></A>angle, is attributable to C, the angle in a semicircle, since B=A and the 
<A NAME="475"></A>other, viz. C,=B, for C is half of two right angles. Therefore it is the 
<A NAME="476"></A>assumption of B, the half of two right angles, from which it follows that 
<A NAME="477"></A>A is attributable to C, i.e. that the angle in a semicircle is a right 
<A NAME="478"></A>angle. Moreover, B is identical with (b) the defining form of A, since 
<A NAME="479"></A>it is what A's definition signifies. Moreover, the formal cause has already 
<A NAME="480"></A>been shown to be the middle. (c) 'Why did the Athenians become involved 
<A NAME="481"></A>in the Persian war?' means 'What cause originated the waging of war against 
<A NAME="482"></A>the Athenians?' and the answer is, 'Because they raided Sardis with the 
<A NAME="483"></A>Eretrians', since this originated the war. Let A be war, B unprovoked raiding, 
<A NAME="484"></A>C the Athenians. Then B, unprovoked raiding, is true of C, the Athenians, 
<A NAME="485"></A>and A is true of B, since men make war on the unjust aggressor. So A, having 
<A NAME="486"></A>war waged upon them, is true of B, the initial aggressors, and B is true 
<A NAME="487"></A>of C, the Athenians, who were the aggressors. Hence here too the cause-in 
<A NAME="488"></A>this case the efficient cause-is the middle term. (d) This is no less true 
<A NAME="489"></A>where the cause is the final cause. E.g. why does one take a walk after 
<A NAME="490"></A>supper? For the sake of one's health. Why does a house exist? For the preservation 
<A NAME="491"></A>of one's goods. The end in view is in the one case health, in the other 
<A NAME="492"></A>preservation. To ask the reason why one must walk after supper is precisely 
<A NAME="493"></A>to ask to what end one must do it. Let C be walking after supper, B the 
<A NAME="494"></A>non-regurgitation of food, A health. Then let walking after supper possess 
<A NAME="495"></A>the property of preventing food from rising to the orifice of the stomach, 
<A NAME="496"></A>and let this condition be healthy; since it seems that B, the non-regurgitation 
<A NAME="497"></A>of food, is attributable to C, taking a walk, and that A, health, is attributable 
<A NAME="498"></A>to B. What, then, is the cause through which A, the final cause, inheres 
<A NAME="499"></A>in C? It is B, the non-regurgitation of food; but B is a kind of definition 
<A NAME="500"></A>of A, for A will be explained by it. Why is B the cause of A's belonging 
<A NAME="501"></A>to C? Because to be in a condition such as B is to be in health. The definitions 
<A NAME="502"></A>must be transposed, and then the detail will become clearer. Incidentally, 
<A NAME="503"></A>here the order of coming to be is the reverse of what it is in proof through 
<A NAME="504"></A>the efficient cause: in the efficient order the middle term must come to 
<A NAME="505"></A>be first, whereas in the teleological order the minor, C, must first take 
<A NAME="506"></A>place, and the end in view comes last in time.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>The same thing may exist for an end and be necessitated as well. 
<A NAME="508"></A>For example, light shines through a lantern (1) because that which consists 
<A NAME="509"></A>of relatively small particles necessarily passes through pores larger than 
<A NAME="510"></A>those particles-assuming that light does issue by penetration- and (2) 
<A NAME="511"></A>for an end, namely to save us from stumbling. If then, a thing can exist 
<A NAME="512"></A>through two causes, can it come to be through two causes-as for instance 
<A NAME="513"></A>if thunder be a hiss and a roar necessarily produced by the quenching of 
<A NAME="514"></A>fire, and also designed, as the Pythagoreans say, for a threat to terrify 
<A NAME="515"></A>those that lie in Tartarus? Indeed, there are very many such cases, mostly 
<A NAME="516"></A>among the processes and products of the natural world; for nature, in different 
<A NAME="517"></A>senses of the term 'nature', produces now for an end, now by 
<A NAME="518"></A>necessity.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>Necessity too is of two kinds. It may work in accordance with a 
<A NAME="520"></A>thing's natural tendency, or by constraint and in opposition to it; as, 
<A NAME="521"></A>for instance, by necessity a stone is borne both upwards and downwards, 
<A NAME="522"></A>but not by the same necessity.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>Of the products of man's intelligence some are never due to chance 
<A NAME="524"></A>or necessity but always to an end, as for example a house or a statue; 
<A NAME="525"></A>others, such as health or safety, may result from chance as 
<A NAME="526"></A>well.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>It is mostly in cases where the issue is indeterminate (though 
<A NAME="528"></A>only where the production does not originate in chance, and the end is 
<A NAME="529"></A>consequently good), that a result is due to an end, and this is true alike 
<A NAME="530"></A>in nature or in art. By chance, on the other hand, nothing comes to be 
<A NAME="531"></A>for an end.

<A NAME="533"></A>The effect may be still coming to be, or its occurrence may be past or 
<A NAME="534"></A>future, yet the cause will be the same as when it is actually existent-for 
<A NAME="535"></A>it is the middle which is the cause-except that if the effect actually 
<A NAME="536"></A>exists the cause is actually existent, if it is coming to be so is the 
<A NAME="537"></A>cause, if its occurrence is past the cause is past, if future the cause 
<A NAME="538"></A>is future. For example, the moon was eclipsed because the earth intervened, 
<A NAME="539"></A>is becoming eclipsed because the earth is in process of intervening, will 
<A NAME="540"></A>be eclipsed because the earth will intervene, is eclipsed because the earth 
<A NAME="541"></A>intervenes.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>To take a second example: assuming that the definition of ice is 
<A NAME="543"></A>solidified water, let C be water, A solidified, B the middle, which is 
<A NAME="544"></A>the cause, namely total failure of heat. Then B is attributed to C, and 
<A NAME="545"></A>A, solidification, to B: ice when B is occurring, has formed when B has 
<A NAME="546"></A>occurred, and will form when B shall occur.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>This sort of cause, then, and its effect come to be simultaneously 
<A NAME="548"></A>when they are in process of becoming, and exist simultaneously when they 
<A NAME="549"></A>actually exist; and the same holds good when they are past and when they 
<A NAME="550"></A>are future. But what of cases where they are not simultaneous? Can causes 
<A NAME="551"></A>and effects different from one another form, as they seem to us to form, 
<A NAME="552"></A>a continuous succession, a past effect resulting from a past cause different 
<A NAME="553"></A>from itself, a future effect from a future cause different from it, and 
<A NAME="554"></A>an effect which is coming-to-be from a cause different from and prior to 
<A NAME="555"></A>it? Now on this theory it is from the posterior event that we reason (and 
<A NAME="556"></A>this though these later events actually have their source of origin in 
<A NAME="557"></A>previous events--a fact which shows that also when the effect is coming-to-be 
<A NAME="558"></A>we still reason from the posterior event), and from the event we cannot 
<A NAME="559"></A>reason (we cannot argue that because an event A has occurred, therefore 
<A NAME="560"></A>an event B has occurred subsequently to A but still in the past-and the 
<A NAME="561"></A>same holds good if the occurrence is future)-cannot reason because, be 
<A NAME="562"></A>the time interval definite or indefinite, it will never be possible to 
<A NAME="563"></A>infer that because it is true to say that A occurred, therefore it is true 
<A NAME="564"></A>to say that B, the subsequent event, occurred; for in the interval between 
<A NAME="565"></A>the events, though A has already occurred, the latter statement will be 
<A NAME="566"></A>false. And the same argument applies also to future events; i.e. one cannot 
<A NAME="567"></A>infer from an event which occurred in the past that a future event will 
<A NAME="568"></A>occur. The reason of this is that the middle must be homogeneous, past 
<A NAME="569"></A>when the extremes are past, future when they are future, coming to be when 
<A NAME="570"></A>they are coming-to-be, actually existent when they are actually existent; 
<A NAME="571"></A>and there cannot be a middle term homogeneous with extremes respectively 
<A NAME="572"></A>past and future. And it is a further difficulty in this theory that the 
<A NAME="573"></A>time interval can be neither indefinite nor definite, since during it the 
<A NAME="574"></A>inference will be false. We have also to inquire what it is that holds 
<A NAME="575"></A>events together so that the coming-to-be now occurring in actual things 
<A NAME="576"></A>follows upon a past event. It is evident, we may suggest, that a past event 
<A NAME="577"></A>and a present process cannot be 'contiguous', for not even two past events 
<A NAME="578"></A>can be 'contiguous'. For past events are limits and atomic; so just as 
<A NAME="579"></A>points are not 'contiguous' neither are past events, since both are indivisible. 
<A NAME="580"></A>For the same reason a past event and a present process cannot be 'contiguous', 
<A NAME="581"></A>for the process is divisible, the event indivisible. Thus the relation 
<A NAME="582"></A>of present process to past event is analogous to that of line to point, 
<A NAME="583"></A>since a process contains an infinity of past events. These questions, however, 
<A NAME="584"></A>must receive a more explicit treatment in our general theory of 
<A NAME="585"></A>change.
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR>The following must suffice as an account of the manner in which 
<A NAME="587"></A>the middle would be identical with the cause on the supposition that coming-to-be 
<A NAME="588"></A>is a series of consecutive events: for in the terms of such a series too 
<A NAME="589"></A>the middle and major terms must form an immediate premiss; e.g. we argue 
<A NAME="590"></A>that, since C has occurred, therefore A occurred: and C's occurrence was 
<A NAME="591"></A>posterior, A's prior; but C is the source of the inference because it is 
<A NAME="592"></A>nearer to the present moment, and the starting-point of time is the present. 
<A NAME="593"></A>We next argue that, since D has occurred, therefore C occurred. Then we 
<A NAME="594"></A>conclude that, since D has occurred, therefore A must have occurred; and 
<A NAME="595"></A>the cause is C, for since D has occurred C must have occurred, and since 
<A NAME="596"></A>C has occurred A must previously have occurred.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>If we get our middle term in this way, will the series terminate 
<A NAME="598"></A>in an immediate premiss, or since, as we said, no two events are 'contiguous', 
<A NAME="599"></A>will a fresh middle term always intervene because there is an infinity 
<A NAME="600"></A>of middles? No: though no two events are 'contiguous', yet we must start 
<A NAME="601"></A>from a premiss consisting of a middle and the present event as major. The 
<A NAME="602"></A>like is true of future events too, since if it is true to say that D will 
<A NAME="603"></A>exist, it must be a prior truth to say that A will exist, and the cause 
<A NAME="604"></A>of this conclusion is C; for if D will exist, C will exist prior to D, 
<A NAME="605"></A>and if C will exist, A will exist prior to it. And here too the same infinite 
<A NAME="606"></A>divisibility might be urged, since future events are not 'contiguous'. 
<A NAME="607"></A>But here too an immediate basic premiss must be assumed. And in the world 
<A NAME="608"></A>of fact this is so: if a house has been built, then blocks must have been 
<A NAME="609"></A>quarried and shaped. The reason is that a house having been built necessitates 
<A NAME="610"></A>a foundation having been laid, and if a foundation has been laid blocks 
<A NAME="611"></A>must have been shaped beforehand. Again, if a house will be built, blocks 
<A NAME="612"></A>will similarly be shaped beforehand; and proof is through the middle in 
<A NAME="613"></A>the same way, for the foundation will exist before the 
<A NAME="614"></A>house.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>Now we observe in Nature a certain kind of circular process of 
<A NAME="616"></A>coming-to-be; and this is possible only if the middle and extreme terms 
<A NAME="617"></A>are reciprocal, since conversion is conditioned by reciprocity in the terms 
<A NAME="618"></A>of the proof. This-the convertibility of conclusions and premisses-has 
<A NAME="619"></A>been proved in our early chapters, and the circular process is an instance 
<A NAME="620"></A>of this. In actual fact it is exemplified thus: when the earth had been 
<A NAME="621"></A>moistened an exhalation was bound to rise, and when an exhalation had risen 
<A NAME="622"></A>cloud was bound to form, and from the formation of cloud rain necessarily 
<A NAME="623"></A>resulted and by the fall of rain the earth was necessarily moistened: but 
<A NAME="624"></A>this was the starting-point, so that a circle is completed; for posit any 
<A NAME="625"></A>one of the terms and another follows from it, and from that another, and 
<A NAME="626"></A>from that again the first.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>Some occurrences are universal (for they are, or come-to-be what 
<A NAME="628"></A>they are, always and in ever case); others again are not always what they 
<A NAME="629"></A>are but only as a general rule: for instance, not every man can grow a 
<A NAME="630"></A>beard, but it is the general rule. In the case of such connexions the middle 
<A NAME="631"></A>term too must be a general rule. For if A is predicated universally of 
<A NAME="632"></A>B and B of C, A too must be predicated always and in every instance of 
<A NAME="633"></A>C, since to hold in every instance and always is of the nature of the universal. 
<A NAME="634"></A>But we have assumed a connexion which is a general rule; consequently the 
<A NAME="635"></A>middle term B must also be a general rule. So connexions which embody a 
<A NAME="636"></A>general rule-i.e. which exist or come to be as a general rule-will also 
<A NAME="637"></A>derive from immediate basic premisses.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="638"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>We have already explained how essential nature is set out in the 
<A NAME="640"></A>terms of a demonstration, and the sense in which it is or is not demonstrable 
<A NAME="641"></A>or definable; so let us now discuss the method to be adopted in tracing 
<A NAME="642"></A>the elements predicated as constituting the definable 
<A NAME="643"></A>form.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>Now of the attributes which inhere always in each several thing 
<A NAME="645"></A>there are some which are wider in extent than it but not wider than its 
<A NAME="646"></A>genus (by attributes of wider extent mean all such as are universal attributes 
<A NAME="647"></A>of each several subject, but in their application are not confined to that 
<A NAME="648"></A>subject). while an attribute may inhere in every triad, yet also in a subject 
<A NAME="649"></A>not a triad-as being inheres in triad but also in subjects not numbers 
<A NAME="650"></A>at all-odd on the other hand is an attribute inhering in every triad and 
<A NAME="651"></A>of wider application (inhering as it does also in pentad), but which does 
<A NAME="652"></A>not extend beyond the genus of triad; for pentad is a number, but nothing 
<A NAME="653"></A>outside number is odd. It is such attributes which we have to select, up 
<A NAME="654"></A>to the exact point at which they are severally of wider extent than the 
<A NAME="655"></A>subject but collectively coextensive with it; for this synthesis must be 
<A NAME="656"></A>the substance of the thing. For example every triad possesses the attributes 
<A NAME="657"></A>number, odd, and prime in both senses, i.e. not only as possessing no divisors, 
<A NAME="658"></A>but also as not being a sum of numbers. This, then, is precisely what triad 
<A NAME="659"></A>is, viz. a number, odd, and prime in the former and also the latter sense 
<A NAME="660"></A>of the term: for these attributes taken severally apply, the first two 
<A NAME="661"></A>to all odd numbers, the last to the dyad also as well as to the triad, 
<A NAME="662"></A>but, taken collectively, to no other subject. Now since we have shown above' 
<A NAME="663"></A>that attributes predicated as belonging to the essential nature are necessary 
<A NAME="664"></A>and that universals are necessary, and since the attributes which we select 
<A NAME="665"></A>as inhering in triad, or in any other subject whose attributes we select 
<A NAME="666"></A>in this way, are predicated as belonging to its essential nature, triad 
<A NAME="667"></A>will thus possess these attributes necessarily. Further, that the synthesis 
<A NAME="668"></A>of them constitutes the substance of triad is shown by the following argument. 
<A NAME="669"></A>If it is not identical with the being of triad, it must be related to triad 
<A NAME="670"></A>as a genus named or nameless. It will then be of wider extent than triad-assuming 
<A NAME="671"></A>that wider potential extent is the character of a genus. If on the other 
<A NAME="672"></A>hand this synthesis is applicable to no subject other than the individual 
<A NAME="673"></A>triads, it will be identical with the being of triad, because we make the 
<A NAME="674"></A>further assumption that the substance of each subject is the predication 
<A NAME="675"></A>of elements in its essential nature down to the last differentia characterizing 
<A NAME="676"></A>the individuals. It follows that any other synthesis thus exhibited will 
<A NAME="677"></A>likewise be identical with the being of the subject.
<A NAME="678"></A><BR><BR>The author of a hand-book on a subject that is a generic whole 
<A NAME="679"></A>should divide the genus into its first infimae species-number e.g. into 
<A NAME="680"></A>triad and dyad-and then endeavour to seize their definitions by the method 
<A NAME="681"></A>we have described-the definition, for example, of straight line or circle 
<A NAME="682"></A>or right angle. After that, having established what the category is to 
<A NAME="683"></A>which the subaltern genus belongs-quantity or quality, for instance-he 
<A NAME="684"></A>should examine the properties 'peculiar' to the species, working through 
<A NAME="685"></A>the proximate common differentiae. He should proceed thus because the attributes 
<A NAME="686"></A>of the genera compounded of the infimae species will be clearly given by 
<A NAME="687"></A>the definitions of the species; since the basic element of them all is 
<A NAME="688"></A>the definition, i.e. the simple infirma species, and the attributes inhere 
<A NAME="689"></A>essentially in the simple infimae species, in the genera only in virtue 
<A NAME="690"></A>of these.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>Divisions according to differentiae are a useful accessory to this 
<A NAME="692"></A>method. What force they have as proofs we did, indeed, explain above, but 
<A NAME="693"></A>that merely towards collecting the essential nature they may be of use 
<A NAME="694"></A>we will proceed to show. They might, indeed, seem to be of no use at all, 
<A NAME="695"></A>but rather to assume everything at the start and to be no better than an 
<A NAME="696"></A>initial assumption made without division. But, in fact, the order in which 
<A NAME="697"></A>the attributes are predicated does make a difference--it matters whether 
<A NAME="698"></A>we say animal-tame-biped, or biped-animal-tame. For if every definable 
<A NAME="699"></A>thing consists of two elements and 'animal-tame' forms a unity, and again 
<A NAME="700"></A>out of this and the further differentia man (or whatever else is the unity 
<A NAME="701"></A>under construction) is constituted, then the elements we assume have necessarily 
<A NAME="702"></A>been reached by division. Again, division is the only possible method of 
<A NAME="703"></A>avoiding the omission of any element of the essential nature. Thus, if 
<A NAME="704"></A>the primary genus is assumed and we then take one of the lower divisions, 
<A NAME="705"></A>the dividendum will not fall whole into this division: e.g. it is not all 
<A NAME="706"></A>animal which is either whole-winged or split-winged but all winged animal, 
<A NAME="707"></A>for it is winged animal to which this differentiation belongs. The primary 
<A NAME="708"></A>differentiation of animal is that within which all animal falls. The like 
<A NAME="709"></A>is true of every other genus, whether outside animal or a subaltern genus 
<A NAME="710"></A>of animal; e.g. the primary differentiation of bird is that within which 
<A NAME="711"></A>falls every bird, of fish that within which falls every fish. So, if we 
<A NAME="712"></A>proceed in this way, we can be sure that nothing has been omitted: by any 
<A NAME="713"></A>other method one is bound to omit something without knowing 
<A NAME="714"></A>it.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>To define and divide one need not know the whole of existence. 
<A NAME="716"></A>Yet some hold it impossible to know the differentiae distinguishing each 
<A NAME="717"></A>thing from every single other thing without knowing every single other 
<A NAME="718"></A>thing; and one cannot, they say, know each thing without knowing its differentiae, 
<A NAME="719"></A>since everything is identical with that from which it does not differ, 
<A NAME="720"></A>and other than that from which it differs. Now first of all this is a fallacy: 
<A NAME="721"></A>not every differentia precludes identity, since many differentiae inhere 
<A NAME="722"></A>in things specifically identical, though not in the substance of these 
<A NAME="723"></A>nor essentially. Secondly, when one has taken one's differing pair of opposites 
<A NAME="724"></A>and assumed that the two sides exhaust the genus, and that the subject 
<A NAME="725"></A>one seeks to define is present in one or other of them, and one has further 
<A NAME="726"></A>verified its presence in one of them; then it does not matter whether or 
<A NAME="727"></A>not one knows all the other subjects of which the differentiae are also 
<A NAME="728"></A>predicated. For it is obvious that when by this process one reaches subjects 
<A NAME="729"></A>incapable of further differentiation one will possess the formula defining 
<A NAME="730"></A>the substance. Moreover, to postulate that the division exhausts the genus 
<A NAME="731"></A>is not illegitimate if the opposites exclude a middle; since if it is the 
<A NAME="732"></A>differentia of that genus, anything contained in the genus must lie on 
<A NAME="733"></A>one of the two sides.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR>In establishing a definition by division one should keep three 
<A NAME="735"></A>objects in view: (1) the admission only of elements in the definable form, 
<A NAME="736"></A>(2) the arrangement of these in the right order, (3) the omission of no 
<A NAME="737"></A>such elements. The first is feasible because one can establish genus and 
<A NAME="738"></A>differentia through the topic of the genus, just as one can conclude the 
<A NAME="739"></A>inherence of an accident through the topic of the accident. The right order 
<A NAME="740"></A>will be achieved if the right term is assumed as primary, and this will 
<A NAME="741"></A>be ensured if the term selected is predicable of all the others but not 
<A NAME="742"></A>all they of it; since there must be one such term. Having assumed this 
<A NAME="743"></A>we at once proceed in the same way with the lower terms; for our second 
<A NAME="744"></A>term will be the first of the remainder, our third the first of those which 
<A NAME="745"></A>follow the second in a 'contiguous' series, since when the higher term 
<A NAME="746"></A>is excluded, that term of the remainder which is 'contiguous' to it will 
<A NAME="747"></A>be primary, and so on. Our procedure makes it clear that no elements in 
<A NAME="748"></A>the definable form have been omitted: we have taken the differentia that 
<A NAME="749"></A>comes first in the order of division, pointing out that animal, e.g. is 
<A NAME="750"></A>divisible exhaustively into A and B, and that the subject accepts one of 
<A NAME="751"></A>the two as its predicate. Next we have taken the differentia of the whole 
<A NAME="752"></A>thus reached, and shown that the whole we finally reach is not further 
<A NAME="753"></A>divisible-i.e. that as soon as we have taken the last differentia to form 
<A NAME="754"></A>the concrete totality, this totality admits of no division into species. 
<A NAME="755"></A>For it is clear that there is no superfluous addition, since all these 
<A NAME="756"></A>terms we have selected are elements in the definable form; and nothing 
<A NAME="757"></A>lacking, since any omission would have to be a genus or a differentia. 
<A NAME="758"></A>Now the primary term is a genus, and this term taken in conjunction with 
<A NAME="759"></A>its differentiae is a genus: moreover the differentiae are all included, 
<A NAME="760"></A>because there is now no further differentia; if there were, the final concrete 
<A NAME="761"></A>would admit of division into species, which, we said, is not the 
<A NAME="762"></A>case.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>To resume our account of the right method of investigation: We 
<A NAME="764"></A>must start by observing a set of similar-i.e. specifically identical-individuals, 
<A NAME="765"></A>and consider what element they have in common. We must then apply the same 
<A NAME="766"></A>process to another set of individuals which belong to one species and are 
<A NAME="767"></A>generically but not specifically identical with the former set. When we 
<A NAME="768"></A>have established what the common element is in all members of this second 
<A NAME="769"></A>species, and likewise in members of further species, we should again consider 
<A NAME="770"></A>whether the results established possess any identity, and persevere until 
<A NAME="771"></A>we reach a single formula, since this will be the definition of the thing. 
<A NAME="772"></A>But if we reach not one formula but two or more, evidently the definiendum 
<A NAME="773"></A>cannot be one thing but must be more than one. I may illustrate my meaning 
<A NAME="774"></A>as follows. If we were inquiring what the essential nature of pride is, 
<A NAME="775"></A>we should examine instances of proud men we know of to see what, as such, 
<A NAME="776"></A>they have in common; e.g. if Alcibiades was proud, or Achilles and Ajax 
<A NAME="777"></A>were proud, we should find on inquiring what they all had in common, that 
<A NAME="778"></A>it was intolerance of insult; it was this which drove Alcibiades to war, 
<A NAME="779"></A>Achilles wrath, and Ajax to suicide. We should next examine other cases, 
<A NAME="780"></A>Lysander, for example, or Socrates, and then if these have in common indifference 
<A NAME="781"></A>alike to good and ill fortune, I take these two results and inquire what 
<A NAME="782"></A>common element have equanimity amid the vicissitudes of life and impatience 
<A NAME="783"></A>of dishonour. If they have none, there will be two genera of pride. Besides, 
<A NAME="784"></A>every definition is always universal and commensurate: the physician does 
<A NAME="785"></A>not prescribe what is healthy for a single eye, but for all eyes or for 
<A NAME="786"></A>a determinate species of eye. It is also easier by this method to define 
<A NAME="787"></A>the single species than the universal, and that is why our procedure should 
<A NAME="788"></A>be from the several species to the universal genera-this for the further 
<A NAME="789"></A>reason too that equivocation is less readily detected in genera than in 
<A NAME="790"></A>infimae species. Indeed, perspicuity is essential in definitions, just 
<A NAME="791"></A>as inferential movement is the minimum required in demonstrations; and 
<A NAME="792"></A>we shall attain perspicuity if we can collect separately the definition 
<A NAME="793"></A>of each species through the group of singulars which we have established 
<A NAME="794"></A>e.g. the definition of similarity not unqualified but restricted to colours 
<A NAME="795"></A>and to figures; the definition of acuteness, but only of sound-and so proceed 
<A NAME="796"></A>to the common universal with a careful avoidance of equivocation. We may 
<A NAME="797"></A>add that if dialectical disputation must not employ metaphors, clearly 
<A NAME="798"></A>metaphors and metaphorical expressions are precluded in definition: otherwise 
<A NAME="799"></A>dialectic would involve metaphors.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="800"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="801"></A><BR><BR>In order to formulate the connexions we wish to prove we have to 
<A NAME="802"></A>select our analyses and divisions. The method of selection consists in 
<A NAME="803"></A>laying down the common genus of all our subjects of investigation-if e.g. 
<A NAME="804"></A>they are animals, we lay down what the properties are which inhere in every 
<A NAME="805"></A>animal. These established, we next lay down the properties essentially 
<A NAME="806"></A>connected with the first of the remaining classes-e.g. if this first subgenus 
<A NAME="807"></A>is bird, the essential properties of every bird-and so on, always characterizing 
<A NAME="808"></A>the proximate subgenus. This will clearly at once enable us to say in virtue 
<A NAME="809"></A>of what character the subgenera-man, e.g. or horse-possess their properties. 
<A NAME="810"></A>Let A be animal, B the properties of every animal, C D E various species 
<A NAME="811"></A>of animal. Then it is clear in virtue of what character B inheres in D-namely 
<A NAME="812"></A>A-and that it inheres in C and E for the same reason: and throughout the 
<A NAME="813"></A>remaining subgenera always the same rule applies.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR><BR>We are now taking our examples from the traditional class-names, 
<A NAME="815"></A>but we must not confine ourselves to considering these. We must collect 
<A NAME="816"></A>any other common character which we observe, and then consider with what 
<A NAME="817"></A>species it is connected and what.properties belong to it. For example, 
<A NAME="818"></A>as the common properties of horned animals we collect the possession of 
<A NAME="819"></A>a third stomach and only one row of teeth. Then since it is clear in virtue 
<A NAME="820"></A>of what character they possess these attributes-namely their horned character-the 
<A NAME="821"></A>next question is, to what species does the possession of horns 
<A NAME="822"></A>attach?
<A NAME="823"></A><BR><BR>Yet a further method of selection is by analogy: for we cannot 
<A NAME="824"></A>find a single identical name to give to a squid's pounce, a fish's spine, 
<A NAME="825"></A>and an animal's bone, although these too possess common properties as if 
<A NAME="826"></A>there were a single osseous nature.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="827"></A><B>Part 15</B>

<A NAME="828"></A><BR><BR>Some connexions that require proof are identical in that they possess 
<A NAME="829"></A>an identical 'middle' e.g. a whole group might be proved through 'reciprocal 
<A NAME="830"></A>replacement'-and of these one class are identical in genus, namely all 
<A NAME="831"></A>those whose difference consists in their concerning different subjects 
<A NAME="832"></A>or in their mode of manifestation. This latter class may be exemplified 
<A NAME="833"></A>by the questions as to the causes respectively of echo, of reflection, 
<A NAME="834"></A>and of the rainbow: the connexions to be proved which these questions embody 
<A NAME="835"></A>are identical generically, because all three are forms of repercussion; 
<A NAME="836"></A>but specifically they are different.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR><BR>Other connexions that require proof only differ in that the 'middle' 
<A NAME="838"></A>of the one is subordinate to the 'middle' of the other. For example: Why 
<A NAME="839"></A>does the Nile rise towards the end of the month? Because towards its close 
<A NAME="840"></A>the month is more stormy. Why is the month more stormy towards its close? 
<A NAME="841"></A>Because the moon is waning. Here the one cause is subordinate to the 
<A NAME="842"></A>other.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="843"></A><B>Part 16</B>

<A NAME="844"></A><BR><BR>The question might be raised with regard to cause and effect whether 
<A NAME="845"></A>when the effect is present the cause also is present; whether, for instance, 
<A NAME="846"></A>if a plant sheds its leaves or the moon is eclipsed, there is present also 
<A NAME="847"></A>the cause of the eclipse or of the fall of the leaves-the possession of 
<A NAME="848"></A>broad leaves, let us say, in the latter case, in the former the earth's 
<A NAME="849"></A>interposition. For, one might argue, if this cause is not present, these 
<A NAME="850"></A>phenomena will have some other cause: if it is present, its effect will 
<A NAME="851"></A>be at once implied by it-the eclipse by the earth's interposition, the 
<A NAME="852"></A>fall of the leaves by the possession of broad leaves; but if so, they will 
<A NAME="853"></A>be logically coincident and each capable of proof through the other. Let 
<A NAME="854"></A>me illustrate: Let A be deciduous character, B the possession of broad 
<A NAME="855"></A>leaves, C vine. Now if A inheres in B (for every broad-leaved plant is 
<A NAME="856"></A>deciduous), and B in C (every vine possessing broad leaves); then A inheres 
<A NAME="857"></A>in C (every vine is deciduous), and the middle term B is the cause. But 
<A NAME="858"></A>we can also demonstrate that the vine has broad leaves because it is deciduous. 
<A NAME="859"></A>Thus, let D be broad-leaved, E deciduous, F vine. Then E inheres in F (since 
<A NAME="860"></A>every vine is deciduous), and D in E (for every deciduous plant has broad 
<A NAME="861"></A>leaves): therefore every vine has broad leaves, and the cause is its deciduous 
<A NAME="862"></A>character. If, however, they cannot each be the cause of the other (for 
<A NAME="863"></A>cause is prior to effect, and the earth's interposition is the cause of 
<A NAME="864"></A>the moon's eclipse and not the eclipse of the interposition)-if, then, 
<A NAME="865"></A>demonstration through the cause is of the reasoned fact and demonstration 
<A NAME="866"></A>not through the cause is of the bare fact, one who knows it through the 
<A NAME="867"></A>eclipse knows the fact of the earth's interposition but not the reasoned 
<A NAME="868"></A>fact. Moreover, that the eclipse is not the cause of the interposition, 
<A NAME="869"></A>but the interposition of the eclipse, is obvious because the interposition 
<A NAME="870"></A>is an element in the definition of eclipse, which shows that the eclipse 
<A NAME="871"></A>is known through the interposition and not vice versa.
<A NAME="872"></A><BR><BR>On the other hand, can a single effect have more than one cause? 
<A NAME="873"></A>One might argue as follows: if the same attribute is predicable of more 
<A NAME="874"></A>than one thing as its primary subject, let B be a primary subject in which 
<A NAME="875"></A>A inheres, and C another primary subject of A, and D and E primary subjects 
<A NAME="876"></A>of B and C respectively. A will then inhere in D and E, and B will be the 
<A NAME="877"></A>cause of A's inherence in D, C of A's inherence in E. The presence of the 
<A NAME="878"></A>cause thus necessitates that of the effect, but the presence of the effect 
<A NAME="879"></A>necessitates the presence not of all that may cause it but only of a cause 
<A NAME="880"></A>which yet need not be the whole cause. We may, however, suggest that if 
<A NAME="881"></A>the connexion to be proved is always universal and commensurate, not only 
<A NAME="882"></A>will the cause be a whole but also the effect will be universal and commensurate. 
<A NAME="883"></A>For instance, deciduous character will belong exclusively to a subject 
<A NAME="884"></A>which is a whole, and, if this whole has species, universally and commensurately 
<A NAME="885"></A>to those species-i.e. either to all species of plant or to a single species. 
<A NAME="886"></A>So in these universal and commensurate connexions the 'middle' and its 
<A NAME="887"></A>effect must reciprocate, i.e. be convertible. Supposing, for example, that 
<A NAME="888"></A>the reason why trees are deciduous is the coagulation of sap, then if a 
<A NAME="889"></A>tree is deciduous, coagulation must be present, and if coagulation is present-not 
<A NAME="890"></A>in any subject but in a tree-then that tree must be 
<A NAME="891"></A>deciduous.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="892"></A><B>Part 17</B>

<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR>Can the cause of an identical effect be not identical in every 
<A NAME="894"></A>instance of the effect but different? Or is that impossible? Perhaps it 
<A NAME="895"></A>is impossible if the effect is demonstrated as essential and not as inhering 
<A NAME="896"></A>in virtue of a symptom or an accident-because the middle is then the definition 
<A NAME="897"></A>of the major term-though possible if the demonstration is not essential. 
<A NAME="898"></A>Now it is possible to consider the effect and its subject as an accidental 
<A NAME="899"></A>conjunction, though such conjunctions would not be regarded as connexions 
<A NAME="900"></A>demanding scientific proof. But if they are accepted as such, the middle 
<A NAME="901"></A>will correspond to the extremes, and be equivocal if they are equivocal, 
<A NAME="902"></A>generically one if they are generically one. Take the question why proportionals 
<A NAME="903"></A>alternate. The cause when they are lines, and when they are numbers, is 
<A NAME="904"></A>both different and identical; different in so far as lines are lines and 
<A NAME="905"></A>not numbers, identical as involving a given determinate increment. In all 
<A NAME="906"></A>proportionals this is so. Again, the cause of likeness between colour and 
<A NAME="907"></A>colour is other than that between figure and figure; for likeness here 
<A NAME="908"></A>is equivocal, meaning perhaps in the latter case equality of the ratios 
<A NAME="909"></A>of the sides and equality of the angles, in the case of colours identity 
<A NAME="910"></A>of the act of perceiving them, or something else of the sort. Again, connexions 
<A NAME="911"></A>requiring proof which are identical by analogy middles also 
<A NAME="912"></A>analogous.
<A NAME="913"></A><BR><BR>The truth is that cause, effect, and subject are reciprocally predicable 
<A NAME="914"></A>in the following way. If the species are taken severally, the effect is 
<A NAME="915"></A>wider than the subject (e.g. the possession of external angles equal to 
<A NAME="916"></A>four right angles is an attribute wider than triangle or are), but it is 
<A NAME="917"></A>coextensive with the species taken collectively (in this instance with 
<A NAME="918"></A>all figures whose external angles are equal to four right angles). And 
<A NAME="919"></A>the middle likewise reciprocates, for the middle is a definition of the 
<A NAME="920"></A>major; which is incidentally the reason why all the sciences are built 
<A NAME="921"></A>up through definition.
<A NAME="922"></A><BR><BR>We may illustrate as follows. Deciduous is a universal attribute 
<A NAME="923"></A>of vine, and is at the same time of wider extent than vine; and of fig, 
<A NAME="924"></A>and is of wider extent than fig: but it is not wider than but coextensive 
<A NAME="925"></A>with the totality of the species. Then if you take the middle which is 
<A NAME="926"></A>proximate, it is a definition of deciduous. I say that, because you will 
<A NAME="927"></A>first reach a middle next the subject, and a premiss asserting it of the 
<A NAME="928"></A>whole subject, and after that a middle-the coagulation of sap or something 
<A NAME="929"></A>of the sort-proving the connexion of the first middle with the major: but 
<A NAME="930"></A>it is the coagulation of sap at the junction of leaf-stalk and stem which 
<A NAME="931"></A>defines deciduous.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR><BR>If an explanation in formal terms of the inter-relation of cause 
<A NAME="933"></A>and effect is demanded, we shall offer the following. Let A be an attribute 
<A NAME="934"></A>of all B, and B of every species of D, but so that both A and B are wider 
<A NAME="935"></A>than their respective subjects. Then B will be a universal attribute of 
<A NAME="936"></A>each species of D (since I call such an attribute universal even if it 
<A NAME="937"></A>is not commensurate, and I call an attribute primary universal if it is 
<A NAME="938"></A>commensurate, not with each species severally but with their totality), 
<A NAME="939"></A>and it extends beyond each of them taken separately.
<A NAME="940"></A><BR><BR>Thus, B is the cause of A's inherence in the species of D: consequently 
<A NAME="941"></A>A must be of wider extent than B; otherwise why should B be the cause of 
<A NAME="942"></A>A's inherence in D any more than A the cause of B's inherence in D? Now 
<A NAME="943"></A>if A is an attribute of all the species of E, all the species of E will 
<A NAME="944"></A>be united by possessing some common cause other than B: otherwise how shall 
<A NAME="945"></A>we be able to say that A is predicable of all of which E is predicable, 
<A NAME="946"></A>while E is not predicable of all of which A can be predicated? I mean how 
<A NAME="947"></A>can there fail to be some special cause of A's inherence in E, as there 
<A NAME="948"></A>was of A's inherence in all the species of D? Then are the species of E, 
<A NAME="949"></A>too, united by possessing some common cause? This cause we must look for. 
<A NAME="950"></A>Let us call it C.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR><BR>We conclude, then, that the same effect may have more than one 
<A NAME="952"></A>cause, but not in subjects specifically identical. For instance, the cause 
<A NAME="953"></A>of longevity in quadrupeds is lack of bile, in birds a dry constitution-or 
<A NAME="954"></A>certainly something different.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="955"></A><B>Part 18</B>

<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR>If immediate premisses are not reached at once, and there is not 
<A NAME="957"></A>merely one middle but several middles, i.e. several causes; is the cause 
<A NAME="958"></A>of the property's inherence in the several species the middle which is 
<A NAME="959"></A>proximate to the primary universal, or the middle which is proximate to 
<A NAME="960"></A>the species? Clearly the cause is that nearest to each species severally 
<A NAME="961"></A>in which it is manifested, for that is the cause of the subject's falling 
<A NAME="962"></A>under the universal. To illustrate formally: C is the cause of B's inherence 
<A NAME="963"></A>in D; hence C is the cause of A's inherence in D, B of A's inherence in 
<A NAME="964"></A>C, while the cause of A's inherence in B is B itself.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="965"></A><B>Part 19</B>

<A NAME="966"></A><BR><BR>As regards syllogism and demonstration, the definition of, and 
<A NAME="967"></A>the conditions required to produce each of them, are now clear, and with 
<A NAME="968"></A>that also the definition of, and the conditions required to produce, demonstrative 
<A NAME="969"></A>knowledge, since it is the same as demonstration. As to the basic premisses, 
<A NAME="970"></A>how they become known and what is the developed state of knowledge of them 
<A NAME="971"></A>is made clear by raising some preliminary problems.
<A NAME="972"></A><BR><BR>We have already said that scientific knowledge through demonstration 
<A NAME="973"></A>is impossible unless a man knows the primary immediate premisses. But there 
<A NAME="974"></A>are questions which might be raised in respect of the apprehension of these 
<A NAME="975"></A>immediate premisses: one might not only ask whether it is of the same kind 
<A NAME="976"></A>as the apprehension of the conclusions, but also whether there is or is 
<A NAME="977"></A>not scientific knowledge of both; or scientific knowledge of the latter, 
<A NAME="978"></A>and of the former a different kind of knowledge; and, further, whether 
<A NAME="979"></A>the developed states of knowledge are not innate but come to be in us, 
<A NAME="980"></A>or are innate but at first unnoticed. Now it is strange if we possess them 
<A NAME="981"></A>from birth; for it means that we possess apprehensions more accurate than 
<A NAME="982"></A>demonstration and fail to notice them. If on the other hand we acquire 
<A NAME="983"></A>them and do not previously possess them, how could we apprehend and learn 
<A NAME="984"></A>without a basis of pre-existent knowledge? For that is impossible, as we 
<A NAME="985"></A>used to find in the case of demonstration. So it emerges that neither can 
<A NAME="986"></A>we possess them from birth, nor can they come to be in us if we are without 
<A NAME="987"></A>knowledge of them to the extent of having no such developed state at all. 
<A NAME="988"></A>Therefore we must possess a capacity of some sort, but not such as to rank 
<A NAME="989"></A>higher in accuracy than these developed states. And this at least is an 
<A NAME="990"></A>obvious characteristic of all animals, for they possess a congenital discriminative 
<A NAME="991"></A>capacity which is called sense-perception. But though sense-perception 
<A NAME="992"></A>is innate in all animals, in some the sense-impression comes to persist, 
<A NAME="993"></A>in others it does not. So animals in which this persistence does not come 
<A NAME="994"></A>to be have either no knowledge at all outside the act of perceiving, or 
<A NAME="995"></A>no knowledge of objects of which no impression persists; animals in which 
<A NAME="996"></A>it does come into being have perception and can continue to retain the 
<A NAME="997"></A>sense-impression in the soul: and when such persistence is frequently repeated 
<A NAME="998"></A>a further distinction at once arises between those which out of the persistence 
<A NAME="999"></A>of such sense-impressions develop a power of systematizing them and those 
<A NAME="1000"></A>which do not. So out of sense-perception comes to be what we call memory, 
<A NAME="1001"></A>and out of frequently repeated memories of the same thing develops experience; 
<A NAME="1002"></A>for a number of memories constitute a single experience. From experience 
<A NAME="1003"></A>again-i.e. from the universal now stabilized in its entirety within the 
<A NAME="1004"></A>soul, the one beside the many which is a single identity within them all-originate 
<A NAME="1005"></A>the skill of the craftsman and the knowledge of the man of science, skill 
<A NAME="1006"></A>in the sphere of coming to be and science in the sphere of 
<A NAME="1007"></A>being.
<A NAME="1008"></A><BR><BR>We conclude that these states of knowledge are neither innate in 
<A NAME="1009"></A>a determinate form, nor developed from other higher states of knowledge, 
<A NAME="1010"></A>but from sense-perception. It is like a rout in battle stopped by first 
<A NAME="1011"></A>one man making a stand and then another, until the original formation has 
<A NAME="1012"></A>been restored. The soul is so constituted as to be capable of this 
<A NAME="1013"></A>process.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>Let us now restate the account given already, though with insufficient 
<A NAME="1015"></A>clearness. When one of a number of logically indiscriminable particulars 
<A NAME="1016"></A>has made a stand, the earliest universal is present in the soul: for though 
<A NAME="1017"></A>the act of sense-perception is of the particular, its content is universal-is 
<A NAME="1018"></A>man, for example, not the man Callias. A fresh stand is made among these 
<A NAME="1019"></A>rudimentary universals, and the process does not cease until the indivisible 
<A NAME="1020"></A>concepts, the true universals, are established: e.g. such and such a species 
<A NAME="1021"></A>of animal is a step towards the genus animal, which by the same process 
<A NAME="1022"></A>is a step towards a further generalization.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR><BR>Thus it is clear that we must get to know the primary premisses 
<A NAME="1024"></A>by induction; for the method by which even sense-perception implants the 
<A NAME="1025"></A>universal is inductive. Now of the thinking states by which we grasp truth, 
<A NAME="1026"></A>some are unfailingly true, others admit of error-opinion, for instance, 
<A NAME="1027"></A>and calculation, whereas scientific knowing and intuition are always true: 
<A NAME="1028"></A>further, no other kind of thought except intuition is more accurate than 
<A NAME="1029"></A>scientific knowledge, whereas primary premisses are more knowable than 
<A NAME="1030"></A>demonstrations, and all scientific knowledge is discursive. From these 
<A NAME="1031"></A>considerations it follows that there will be no scientific knowledge of 
<A NAME="1032"></A>the primary premisses, and since except intuition nothing can be truer 
<A NAME="1033"></A>than scientific knowledge, it will be intuition that apprehends the primary 
<A NAME="1034"></A>premisses-a result which also follows from the fact that demonstration 
<A NAME="1035"></A>cannot be the originative source of demonstration, nor, consequently, scientific 
<A NAME="1036"></A>knowledge of scientific knowledge.If, therefore, it is the only other kind 
<A NAME="1037"></A>of true thinking except scientific knowing, intuition will be the originative 
<A NAME="1038"></A>source of scientific knowledge. And the originative source of science grasps 
<A NAME="1039"></A>the original basic premiss, while science as a whole is similarly related 
<A NAME="1040"></A>as originative source to the whole body of fact.
