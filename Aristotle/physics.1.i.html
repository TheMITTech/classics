<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>When the objects of an inquiry, in any department, have principles, conditions, 
<A NAME="12"></A>or elements, it is through acquaintance with these that knowledge, that 
<A NAME="13"></A>is to say scientific knowledge, is attained. For we do not think that we 
<A NAME="14"></A>know a thing until we are acquainted with its primary conditions or first 
<A NAME="15"></A>principles, and have carried our analysis as far as its simplest elements. 
<A NAME="16"></A>Plainly therefore in the science of Nature, as in other branches of study, 
<A NAME="17"></A>our first task will be to try to determine what relates to its 
<A NAME="18"></A>principles.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>The natural way of doing this is to start from the things which 
<A NAME="20"></A>are more knowable and obvious to us and proceed towards those which are 
<A NAME="21"></A>clearer and more knowable by nature; for the same things are not 'knowable 
<A NAME="22"></A>relatively to us' and 'knowable' without qualification. So in the present 
<A NAME="23"></A>inquiry we must follow this method and advance from what is more obscure 
<A NAME="24"></A>by nature, but clearer to us, towards what is more clear and more knowable 
<A NAME="25"></A>by nature.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>Now what is to us plain and obvious at first is rather confused 
<A NAME="27"></A>masses, the elements and principles of which become known to us later by 
<A NAME="28"></A>analysis. Thus we must advance from generalities to particulars; for it 
<A NAME="29"></A>is a whole that is best known to sense-perception, and a generality is 
<A NAME="30"></A>a kind of whole, comprehending many things within it, like parts. Much 
<A NAME="31"></A>the same thing happens in the relation of the name to the formula. A name, 
<A NAME="32"></A>e.g. 'round', means vaguely a sort of whole: its definition analyses this 
<A NAME="33"></A>into its particular senses. Similarly a child begins by calling all men 
<A NAME="34"></A>'father', and all women 'mother', but later on distinguishes each of 
<A NAME="35"></A>them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="36"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>The principles in question must be either (a) one or (b) more than 
<A NAME="38"></A>one. If (a) one, it must be either (i) motionless, as Parmenides and Melissus 
<A NAME="39"></A>assert, or (ii) in motion, as the physicists hold, some declaring air to 
<A NAME="40"></A>be the first principle, others water. If (b) more than one, then either 
<A NAME="41"></A>(i) a finite or (ii) an infinite plurality. If (i) finite (but more than 
<A NAME="42"></A>one), then either two or three or four or some other number. If (ii) infinite, 
<A NAME="43"></A>then either as Democritus believed one in kind, but differing in shape 
<A NAME="44"></A>or form; or different in kind and even contrary.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>A similar inquiry is made by those who inquire into the number 
<A NAME="46"></A>of existents: for they inquire whether the ultimate constituents of existing 
<A NAME="47"></A>things are one or many, and if many, whether a finite or an infinite plurality. 
<A NAME="48"></A>So they too are inquiring whether the principle or element is one or 
<A NAME="49"></A>many.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>Now to investigate whether Being is one and motionless is not a 
<A NAME="51"></A>contribution to the science of Nature. For just as the geometer has nothing 
<A NAME="52"></A>more to say to one who denies the principles of his science-this being 
<A NAME="53"></A>a question for a different science or for or common to all-so a man investigating 
<A NAME="54"></A>principles cannot argue with one who denies their existence. For if Being 
<A NAME="55"></A>is just one, and one in the way mentioned, there is a principle no longer, 
<A NAME="56"></A>since a principle must be the principle of some thing or 
<A NAME="57"></A>things.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>To inquire therefore whether Being is one in this sense would be 
<A NAME="59"></A>like arguing against any other position maintained for the sake of argument 
<A NAME="60"></A>(such as the Heraclitean thesis, or such a thesis as that Being is one 
<A NAME="61"></A>man) or like refuting a merely contentious argument-a description which 
<A NAME="62"></A>applies to the arguments both of Melissus and of Parmenides: their premisses 
<A NAME="63"></A>are false and their conclusions do not follow. Or rather the argument of 
<A NAME="64"></A>Melissus is gross and palpable and offers no difficulty at all: accept 
<A NAME="65"></A>one ridiculous proposition and the rest follows-a simple enough 
<A NAME="66"></A>proceeding.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>We physicists, on the other hand, must take for granted that the 
<A NAME="68"></A>things that exist by nature are, either all or some of them, in motion 
<A NAME="69"></A>which is indeed made plain by induction. Moreover, no man of science is 
<A NAME="70"></A>bound to solve every kind of difficulty that may be raised, but only as 
<A NAME="71"></A>many as are drawn falsely from the principles of the science: it is not 
<A NAME="72"></A>our business to refute those that do not arise in this way: just as it 
<A NAME="73"></A>is the duty of the geometer to refute the squaring of the circle by means 
<A NAME="74"></A>of segments, but it is not his duty to refute Antiphon's proof. At the 
<A NAME="75"></A>same time the holders of the theory of which we are speaking do incidentally 
<A NAME="76"></A>raise physical questions, though Nature is not their subject: so it will 
<A NAME="77"></A>perhaps be as well to spend a few words on them, especially as the inquiry 
<A NAME="78"></A>is not without scientific interest.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>The most pertinent question with which to begin will be this: In 
<A NAME="80"></A>what sense is it asserted that all things are one? For 'is' is used in 
<A NAME="81"></A>many senses. Do they mean that all things 'are' substance or quantities 
<A NAME="82"></A>or qualities? And, further, are all things one substance-one man, one horse, 
<A NAME="83"></A>or one soul-or quality and that one and the same-white or hot or something 
<A NAME="84"></A>of the kind? These are all very different doctrines and all impossible 
<A NAME="85"></A>to maintain.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>For if both substance and quantity and quality are, then, whether 
<A NAME="87"></A>these exist independently of each other or not, Being will be 
<A NAME="88"></A>many.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>If on the other hand it is asserted that all things are quality 
<A NAME="90"></A>or quantity, then, whether substance exists or not, an absurdity results, 
<A NAME="91"></A>if the impossible can properly be called absurd. For none of the others 
<A NAME="92"></A>can exist independently: substance alone is independent: for everything 
<A NAME="93"></A>is predicated of substance as subject. Now Melissus says that Being is 
<A NAME="94"></A>infinite. It is then a quantity. For the infinite is in the category of 
<A NAME="95"></A>quantity, whereas substance or quality or affection cannot be infinite 
<A NAME="96"></A>except through a concomitant attribute, that is, if at the same time they 
<A NAME="97"></A>are also quantities. For to define the infinite you must use quantity in 
<A NAME="98"></A>your formula, but not substance or quality. If then Being is both substance 
<A NAME="99"></A>and quantity, it is two, not one: if only substance, it is not infinite 
<A NAME="100"></A>and has no magnitude; for to have that it will have to be a 
<A NAME="101"></A>quantity.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>Again, 'one' itself, no less than 'being', is used in many senses, 
<A NAME="103"></A>so we must consider in what sense the word is used when it is said that 
<A NAME="104"></A>the All is one.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>Now we say that (a) the continuous is one or that (b) the indivisible 
<A NAME="106"></A>is one, or (c) things are said to be 'one', when their essence is one and 
<A NAME="107"></A>the same, as 'liquor' and 'drink'.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>If (a) their One is one in the sense of continuous, it is many, 
<A NAME="109"></A>for the continuous is divisible ad infinitum.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>There is, indeed, a difficulty about part and whole, perhaps not 
<A NAME="111"></A>relevant to the present argument, yet deserving consideration on its own 
<A NAME="112"></A>account-namely, whether the part and the whole are one or more than one, 
<A NAME="113"></A>and how they can be one or many, and, if they are more than one, in what 
<A NAME="114"></A>sense they are more than one. (Similarly with the parts of wholes which 
<A NAME="115"></A>are not continuous.) Further, if each of the two parts is indivisibly one 
<A NAME="116"></A>with the whole, the difficulty arises that they will be indivisibly one 
<A NAME="117"></A>with each other also.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>But to proceed: If (b) their One is one as indivisible, nothing 
<A NAME="119"></A>will have quantity or quality, and so the one will not be infinite, as 
<A NAME="120"></A>Melissus says-nor, indeed, limited, as Parmenides says, for though the 
<A NAME="121"></A>limit is indivisible, the limited is not.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>But if (c) all things are one in the sense of having the same definition, 
<A NAME="123"></A>like 'raiment' and 'dress', then it turns out that they are maintaining 
<A NAME="124"></A>the Heraclitean doctrine, for it will be the same thing 'to be good' and 
<A NAME="125"></A>'to be bad', and 'to be good' and 'to be not good', and so the same thing 
<A NAME="126"></A>will be 'good' and 'not good', and man and horse; in fact, their view will 
<A NAME="127"></A>be, not that all things are one, but that they are nothing; and that 'to 
<A NAME="128"></A>be of such-and-such a quality' is the same as 'to be of such-and-such a 
<A NAME="129"></A>size'.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>Even the more recent of the ancient thinkers were in a pother lest 
<A NAME="131"></A>the same thing should turn out in their hands both one and many. So some, 
<A NAME="132"></A>like Lycophron, were led to omit 'is', others to change the mode of expression 
<A NAME="133"></A>and say 'the man has been whitened' instead of 'is white', and 'walks' 
<A NAME="134"></A>instead of 'is walking', for fear that if they added the word 'is' they 
<A NAME="135"></A>should be making the one to be many-as if 'one' and 'being' were always 
<A NAME="136"></A>used in one and the same sense. What 'is' may be many either in definition 
<A NAME="137"></A>(for example 'to be white' is one thing, 'to be musical' another, yet the 
<A NAME="138"></A>same thing be both, so the one is many) or by division, as the whole and 
<A NAME="139"></A>its parts. On this point, indeed, they were already getting into difficulties 
<A NAME="140"></A>and admitted that the one was many-as if there was any difficulty about 
<A NAME="141"></A>the same thing being both one and many, provided that these are not opposites; 
<A NAME="142"></A>for 'one' may mean either 'potentially one' or 'actually 
<A NAME="143"></A>one'.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="144"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>If, then, we approach the thesis in this way it seems impossible 
<A NAME="146"></A>for all things to be one. Further, the arguments they use to prove their 
<A NAME="147"></A>position are not difficult to expose. For both of them reason contentiously-I 
<A NAME="148"></A>mean both Melissus and Parmenides. [Their premisses are false and their 
<A NAME="149"></A>conclusions do not follow. Or rather the argument of Melissus is gross 
<A NAME="150"></A>and palpable and offers no difficulty at all: admit one ridiculous proposition 
<A NAME="151"></A>and the rest follows-a simple enough proceeding.] The fallacy of Melissus 
<A NAME="152"></A>is obvious. For he supposes that the assumption 'what has come into being 
<A NAME="153"></A>always has a beginning' justifies the assumption 'what has not come into 
<A NAME="154"></A>being has no beginning'. Then this also is absurd, that in every case there 
<A NAME="155"></A>should be a beginning of the thing-not of the time and not only in the 
<A NAME="156"></A>case of coming to be in the full sense but also in the case of coming to 
<A NAME="157"></A>have a quality-as if change never took place suddenly. Again, does it follow 
<A NAME="158"></A>that Being, if one, is motionless? Why should it not move, the whole of 
<A NAME="159"></A>it within itself, as parts of it do which are unities, e.g. this water? 
<A NAME="160"></A>Again, why is qualitative change impossible? But, further, Being cannot 
<A NAME="161"></A>be one in form, though it may be in what it is made of. (Even some of the 
<A NAME="162"></A>physicists hold it to be one in the latter way, though not in the former.) 
<A NAME="163"></A>Man obviously differs from horse in form, and contraries from each 
<A NAME="164"></A>other.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>The same kind of argument holds good against Parmenides also, besides 
<A NAME="166"></A>any that may apply specially to his view: the answer to him being that 
<A NAME="167"></A>'this is not true' and 'that does not follow'. His assumption that one 
<A NAME="168"></A>is used in a single sense only is false, because it is used in several. 
<A NAME="169"></A>His conclusion does not follow, because if we take only white things, and 
<A NAME="170"></A>if 'white' has a single meaning, none the less what is white will be many 
<A NAME="171"></A>and not one. For what is white will not be one either in the sense that 
<A NAME="172"></A>it is continuous or in the sense that it must be defined in only one way. 
<A NAME="173"></A>'Whiteness' will be different from 'what has whiteness'. Nor does this 
<A NAME="174"></A>mean that there is anything that can exist separately, over and above what 
<A NAME="175"></A>is white. For 'whiteness' and 'that which is white' differ in definition, 
<A NAME="176"></A>not in the sense that they are things which can exist apart from each other. 
<A NAME="177"></A>But Parmenides had not come in sight of this distinction.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>It is necessary for him, then, to assume not only that 'being' 
<A NAME="179"></A>has the same meaning, of whatever it is predicated, but further that it 
<A NAME="180"></A>means (1) what just is and (2) what is just one.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>It must be so, for (1) an attribute is predicated of some subject, 
<A NAME="182"></A>so that the subject to which 'being' is attributed will not be, as it is 
<A NAME="183"></A>something different from 'being'. Something, therefore, which is not will 
<A NAME="184"></A>be. Hence 'substance' will not be a predicate of anything else. For the 
<A NAME="185"></A>subject cannot be a being, unless 'being' means several things, in such 
<A NAME="186"></A>a way that each is something. But ex hypothesi 'being' means only one 
<A NAME="187"></A>thing.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>If, then, 'substance' is not attributed to anything, but other 
<A NAME="189"></A>things are attributed to it, how does 'substance' mean what is rather than 
<A NAME="190"></A>what is not? For suppose that 'substance' is also 'white'. Since the definition 
<A NAME="191"></A>of the latter is different (for being cannot even be attributed to white, 
<A NAME="192"></A>as nothing is which is not 'substance'), it follows that 'white' is not-being--and 
<A NAME="193"></A>that not in the sense of a particular not-being, but in the sense that 
<A NAME="194"></A>it is not at all. Hence 'substance' is not; for it is true to say that 
<A NAME="195"></A>it is white, which we found to mean not-being. If to avoid this we say 
<A NAME="196"></A>that even 'white' means substance, it follows that 'being' has more than 
<A NAME="197"></A>one meaning.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>In particular, then, Being will not have magnitude, if it is substance. 
<A NAME="199"></A>For each of the two parts must he in a different sense.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>(2) Substance is plainly divisible into other substances, if we 
<A NAME="201"></A>consider the mere nature of a definition. For instance, if 'man' is a substance, 
<A NAME="202"></A>'animal' and 'biped' must also be substances. For if not substances, they 
<A NAME="203"></A>must be attributes-and if attributes, attributes either of (a) man or of 
<A NAME="204"></A>(b) some other subject. But neither is possible.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>(a) An attribute is either that which may or may not belong to 
<A NAME="206"></A>the subject or that in whose definition the subject of which it is an attribute 
<A NAME="207"></A>is involved. Thus 'sitting' is an example of a separable attribute, while 
<A NAME="208"></A>'snubness' contains the definition of 'nose', to which we attribute snubness. 
<A NAME="209"></A>Further, the definition of the whole is not contained in the definitions 
<A NAME="210"></A>of the contents or elements of the definitory formula; that of 'man' for 
<A NAME="211"></A>instance in 'biped', or that of 'white man' in 'white'. If then this is 
<A NAME="212"></A>so, and if 'biped' is supposed to be an attribute of 'man', it must be 
<A NAME="213"></A>either separable, so that 'man' might possibly not be 'biped', or the definition 
<A NAME="214"></A>of 'man' must come into the definition of 'biped'-which is impossible, 
<A NAME="215"></A>as the converse is the case.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>(b) If, on the other hand, we suppose that 'biped' and 'animal' 
<A NAME="217"></A>are attributes not of man but of something else, and are not each of them 
<A NAME="218"></A>a substance, then 'man' too will be an attribute of something else. But 
<A NAME="219"></A>we must assume that substance is not the attribute of anything, that the 
<A NAME="220"></A>subject of which both 'biped' and 'animal' and each separately are predicated 
<A NAME="221"></A>is the subject also of the complex 'biped animal'.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>Are we then to say that the All is composed of indivisible substances? 
<A NAME="223"></A>Some thinkers did, in point of fact, give way to both arguments. To the 
<A NAME="224"></A>argument that all things are one if being means one thing, they conceded 
<A NAME="225"></A>that not-being is; to that from bisection, they yielded by positing atomic 
<A NAME="226"></A>magnitudes. But obviously it is not true that if being means one thing, 
<A NAME="227"></A>and cannot at the same time mean the contradictory of this, there will 
<A NAME="228"></A>be nothing which is not, for even if what is not cannot be without qualification, 
<A NAME="229"></A>there is no reason why it should not be a particular not-being. To say 
<A NAME="230"></A>that all things will be one, if there is nothing besides Being itself, 
<A NAME="231"></A>is absurd. For who understands 'being itself' to be anything but a particular 
<A NAME="232"></A>substance? But if this is so, there is nothing to prevent there being many 
<A NAME="233"></A>beings, as has been said.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>It is, then, clearly impossible for Being to be one in this 
<A NAME="235"></A>sense.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="236"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>The physicists on the other hand have two modes of 
<A NAME="238"></A>explanation.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR>The first set make the underlying body one either one of the three 
<A NAME="240"></A>or something else which is denser than fire and rarer than air then generate 
<A NAME="241"></A>everything else from this, and obtain multiplicity by condensation and 
<A NAME="242"></A>rarefaction. Now these are contraries, which may be generalized into 'excess 
<A NAME="243"></A>and defect'. (Compare Plato's 'Great and Small'-except that he make these 
<A NAME="244"></A>his matter, the one his form, while the others treat the one which underlies 
<A NAME="245"></A>as matter and the contraries as differentiae, i.e. forms).
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>The second set assert that the contrarieties are contained in the 
<A NAME="247"></A>one and emerge from it by segregation, for example Anaximander and also 
<A NAME="248"></A>all those who assert that 'what is' is one and many, like Empedocles and 
<A NAME="249"></A>Anaxagoras; for they too produce other things from their mixture by segregation. 
<A NAME="250"></A>These differ, however, from each other in that the former imagines a cycle 
<A NAME="251"></A>of such changes, the latter a single series. Anaxagoras again made both 
<A NAME="252"></A>his 'homceomerous' substances and his contraries infinite in multitude, 
<A NAME="253"></A>whereas Empedocles posits only the so-called elements.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>The theory of Anaxagoras that the principles are infinite in multitude 
<A NAME="255"></A>was probably due to his acceptance of the common opinion of the physicists 
<A NAME="256"></A>that nothing comes into being from not-being. For this is the reason why 
<A NAME="257"></A>they use the phrase 'all things were together' and the coming into being 
<A NAME="258"></A>of such and such a kind of thing is reduced to change of quality, while 
<A NAME="259"></A>some spoke of combination and separation. Moreover, the fact that the contraries 
<A NAME="260"></A>proceed from each other led them to the conclusion. The one, they reasoned, 
<A NAME="261"></A>must have already existed in the other; for since everything that comes 
<A NAME="262"></A>into being must arise either from what is or from what is not, and it is 
<A NAME="263"></A>impossible for it to arise from what is not (on this point all the physicists 
<A NAME="264"></A>agree), they thought that the truth of the alternative necessarily followed, 
<A NAME="265"></A>namely that things come into being out of existent things, i.e. out of 
<A NAME="266"></A>things already present, but imperceptible to our senses because of the 
<A NAME="267"></A>smallness of their bulk. So they assert that everything has been mixed 
<A NAME="268"></A>in every. thing, because they saw everything arising out of everything. 
<A NAME="269"></A>But things, as they say, appear different from one another and receive 
<A NAME="270"></A>different names according to the nature of the particles which are numerically 
<A NAME="271"></A>predominant among the innumerable constituents of the mixture. For nothing, 
<A NAME="272"></A>they say, is purely and entirely white or black or sweet, bone or flesh, 
<A NAME="273"></A>but the nature of a thing is held to be that of which it contains the 
<A NAME="274"></A>most.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>Now (1) the infinite qua infinite is unknowable, so that what is 
<A NAME="276"></A>infinite in multitude or size is unknowable in quantity, and what is infinite 
<A NAME="277"></A>in variety of kind is unknowable in quality. But the principles in question 
<A NAME="278"></A>are infinite both in multitude and in kind. Therefore it is impossible 
<A NAME="279"></A>to know things which are composed of them; for it is when we know the nature 
<A NAME="280"></A>and quantity of its components that we suppose we know a 
<A NAME="281"></A>complex.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>Further (2) if the parts of a whole may be of any size in the direction 
<A NAME="283"></A>either of greatness or of smallness (by 'parts' I mean components into 
<A NAME="284"></A>which a whole can be divided and which are actually present in it), it 
<A NAME="285"></A>is necessary that the whole thing itself may be of any size. Clearly, therefore, 
<A NAME="286"></A>since it is impossible for an animal or plant to be indefinitely big or 
<A NAME="287"></A>small, neither can its parts be such, or the whole will be the same. But 
<A NAME="288"></A>flesh, bone, and the like are the parts of animals, and the fruits are 
<A NAME="289"></A>the parts of plants. Hence it is obvious that neither flesh, bone, nor 
<A NAME="290"></A>any such thing can be of indefinite size in the direction either of the 
<A NAME="291"></A>greater or of the less.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>Again (3) according to the theory all such things are already present 
<A NAME="293"></A>in one another and do not come into being but are constituents which are 
<A NAME="294"></A>separated out, and a thing receives its designation from its chief constituent. 
<A NAME="295"></A>Further, anything may come out of anything-water by segregation from flesh 
<A NAME="296"></A>and flesh from water. Hence, since every finite body is exhausted by the 
<A NAME="297"></A>repeated abstraction of a finite body, it seems obviously to follow that 
<A NAME="298"></A>everything cannot subsist in everything else. For let flesh be extracted 
<A NAME="299"></A>from water and again more flesh be produced from the remainder by repeating 
<A NAME="300"></A>the process of separation: then, even though the quantity separated out 
<A NAME="301"></A>will continually decrease, still it will not fall below a certain magnitude. 
<A NAME="302"></A>If, therefore, the process comes to an end, everything will not be in everything 
<A NAME="303"></A>else (for there will be no flesh in the remaining water); if on the other 
<A NAME="304"></A>hand it does not, and further extraction is always possible, there will 
<A NAME="305"></A>be an infinite multitude of finite equal particles in a finite quantity-which 
<A NAME="306"></A>is impossible. Another proof may be added: Since every body must diminish 
<A NAME="307"></A>in size when something is taken from it, and flesh is quantitatively definite 
<A NAME="308"></A>in respect both of greatness and smallness, it is clear that from the minimum 
<A NAME="309"></A>quantity of flesh no body can be separated out; for the flesh left would 
<A NAME="310"></A>be less than the minimum of flesh.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>Lastly (4) in each of his infinite bodies there would be already 
<A NAME="312"></A>present infinite flesh and blood and brain- having a distinct existence, 
<A NAME="313"></A>however, from one another, and no less real than the infinite bodies, and 
<A NAME="314"></A>each infinite: which is contrary to reason.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>The statement that complete separation never will take place is 
<A NAME="316"></A>correct enough, though Anaxagoras is not fully aware of what it means. 
<A NAME="317"></A>For affections are indeed inseparable. If then colours and states had entered 
<A NAME="318"></A>into the mixture, and if separation took place, there would be a 'white' 
<A NAME="319"></A>or a 'healthy' which was nothing but white or healthy, i.e. was not the 
<A NAME="320"></A>predicate of a subject. So his 'Mind' is an absurd person aiming at the 
<A NAME="321"></A>impossible, if he is supposed to wish to separate them, and it is impossible 
<A NAME="322"></A>to do so, both in respect of quantity and of quality- of quantity, because 
<A NAME="323"></A>there is no minimum magnitude, and of quality, because affections are 
<A NAME="324"></A>inseparable.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>Nor is Anaxagoras right about the coming to be of homogeneous bodies. 
<A NAME="326"></A>It is true there is a sense in which clay is divided into pieces of clay, 
<A NAME="327"></A>but there is another in which it is not. Water and air are, and are generated 
<A NAME="328"></A>'from' each other, but not in the way in which bricks come 'from' a house 
<A NAME="329"></A>and again a house 'from' bricks; and it is better to assume a smaller and 
<A NAME="330"></A>finite number of principles, as Empedocles does.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="331"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>All thinkers then agree in making the contraries principles, both 
<A NAME="333"></A>those who describe the All as one and unmoved (for even Parmenides treats 
<A NAME="334"></A>hot and cold as principles under the names of fire and earth) and those 
<A NAME="335"></A>too who use the rare and the dense. The same is true of Democritus also, 
<A NAME="336"></A>with his plenum and void, both of which exist, be says, the one as being, 
<A NAME="337"></A>the other as not-being. Again he speaks of differences in position, shape, 
<A NAME="338"></A>and order, and these are genera of which the species are contraries, namely, 
<A NAME="339"></A>of position, above and below, before and behind; of shape, angular and 
<A NAME="340"></A>angle-less, straight and round.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>It is plain then that they all in one way or another identify the 
<A NAME="342"></A>contraries with the principles. And with good reason. For first principles 
<A NAME="343"></A>must not be derived from one another nor from anything else, while everything 
<A NAME="344"></A>has to be derived from them. But these conditions are fulfilled by the 
<A NAME="345"></A>primary contraries, which are not derived from anything else because they 
<A NAME="346"></A>are primary, nor from each other because they are contraries.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>But we must see how this can be arrived at as a reasoned result, 
<A NAME="348"></A>as well as in the way just indicated.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>Our first presupposition must be that in nature nothing acts on, 
<A NAME="350"></A>or is acted on by, any other thing at random, nor may anything come from 
<A NAME="351"></A>anything else, unless we mean that it does so in virtue of a concomitant 
<A NAME="352"></A>attribute. For how could 'white' come from 'musical', unless 'musical' 
<A NAME="353"></A>happened to be an attribute of the not-white or of the black? No, 'white' 
<A NAME="354"></A>comes from 'not-white'-and not from any 'not-white', but from black or 
<A NAME="355"></A>some intermediate colour. Similarly, 'musical' comes to be from 'not-musical', 
<A NAME="356"></A>but not from any thing other than musical, but from 'unmusical' or any 
<A NAME="357"></A>intermediate state there may be.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>Nor again do things pass into the first chance thing; 'white' does 
<A NAME="359"></A>not pass into 'musical' (except, it may be, in virtue of a concomitant 
<A NAME="360"></A>attribute), but into 'not-white'-and not into any chance thing which is 
<A NAME="361"></A>not white, but into black or an intermediate colour; 'musical' passes into 
<A NAME="362"></A>'not-musical'-and not into any chance thing other than musical, but into 
<A NAME="363"></A>'unmusical' or any intermediate state there may be.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>The same holds of other things also: even things which are not 
<A NAME="365"></A>simple but complex follow the same principle, but the opposite state has 
<A NAME="366"></A>not received a name, so we fail to notice the fact. What is in tune must 
<A NAME="367"></A>come from what is not in tune, and vice versa; the tuned passes into untunedness-and 
<A NAME="368"></A>not into any untunedness, but into the corresponding opposite. It does 
<A NAME="369"></A>not matter whether we take attunement, order, or composition for our illustration; 
<A NAME="370"></A>the principle is obviously the same in all, and in fact applies equally 
<A NAME="371"></A>to the production of a house, a statue, or any other complex. A house comes 
<A NAME="372"></A>from certain things in a certain state of separation instead of conjunction, 
<A NAME="373"></A>a statue (or any other thing that has been shaped) from shapelessness-each 
<A NAME="374"></A>of these objects being partly order and partly composition.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>If then this is true, everything that comes to be or passes away 
<A NAME="376"></A>from, or passes into, its contrary or an intermediate state. But the intermediates 
<A NAME="377"></A>are derived from the contraries-colours, for instance, from black and white. 
<A NAME="378"></A>Everything, therefore, that comes to be by a natural process is either 
<A NAME="379"></A>a contrary or a product of contraries.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>Up to this point we have practically had most of the other writers 
<A NAME="381"></A>on the subject with us, as I have said already: for all of them identify 
<A NAME="382"></A>their elements, and what they call their principles, with the contraries, 
<A NAME="383"></A>giving no reason indeed for the theory, but contrained as it were by the 
<A NAME="384"></A>truth itself. They differ, however, from one another in that some assume 
<A NAME="385"></A>contraries which are more primary, others contraries which are less so: 
<A NAME="386"></A>some those more knowable in the order of explanation, others those more 
<A NAME="387"></A>familiar to sense. For some make hot and cold, or again moist and dry, 
<A NAME="388"></A>the conditions of becoming; while others make odd and even, or again Love 
<A NAME="389"></A>and Strife; and these differ from each other in the way 
<A NAME="390"></A>mentioned.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>Hence their principles are in one sense the same, in another different; 
<A NAME="392"></A>different certainly, as indeed most people think, but the same inasmuch 
<A NAME="393"></A>as they are analogous; for all are taken from the same table of columns, 
<A NAME="394"></A>some of the pairs being wider, others narrower in extent. In this way then 
<A NAME="395"></A>their theories are both the same and different, some better, some worse; 
<A NAME="396"></A>some, as I have said, take as their contraries what is more knowable in 
<A NAME="397"></A>the order of explanation, others what is more familiar to sense. (The universal 
<A NAME="398"></A>is more knowable in the order of explanation, the particular in the order 
<A NAME="399"></A>of sense: for explanation has to do with the universal, sense with the 
<A NAME="400"></A>particular.) 'The great and the small', for example, belong to the former 
<A NAME="401"></A>class, 'the dense and the rare' to the latter.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then that our principles must be 
<A NAME="403"></A>contraries.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="404"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>The next question is whether the principles are two or three or 
<A NAME="406"></A>more in number.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>One they cannot be, for there cannot be one contrary. Nor can they 
<A NAME="408"></A>be innumerable, because, if so, Being will not be knowable: and in any 
<A NAME="409"></A>one genus there is only one contrariety, and substance is one genus: also 
<A NAME="410"></A>a finite number is sufficient, and a finite number, such as the principles 
<A NAME="411"></A>of Empedocles, is better than an infinite multitude; for Empedocles professes 
<A NAME="412"></A>to obtain from his principles all that Anaxagoras obtains from his innumerable 
<A NAME="413"></A>principles. Lastly, some contraries are more primary than others, and some 
<A NAME="414"></A>arise from others-for example sweet and bitter, white and black-whereas 
<A NAME="415"></A>the principles must always remain principles.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR><BR>This will suffice to show that the principles are neither one nor 
<A NAME="417"></A>innumerable.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>Granted, then, that they are a limited number, it is plausible 
<A NAME="419"></A>to suppose them more than two. For it is difficult to see how either density 
<A NAME="420"></A>should be of such a nature as to act in any way on rarity or rarity on 
<A NAME="421"></A>density. The same is true of any other pair of contraries; for Love does 
<A NAME="422"></A>not gather Strife together and make things out of it, nor does Strife make 
<A NAME="423"></A>anything out of Love, but both act on a third thing different from both. 
<A NAME="424"></A>Some indeed assume more than one such thing from which they construct the 
<A NAME="425"></A>world of nature.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>Other objections to the view that it is not necessary to assume 
<A NAME="427"></A>a third principle as a substratum may be added. (1) We do not find that 
<A NAME="428"></A>the contraries constitute the substance of any thing. But what is a first 
<A NAME="429"></A>principle ought not to be the predicate of any subject. If it were, there 
<A NAME="430"></A>would be a principle of the supposed principle: for the subject is a principle, 
<A NAME="431"></A>and prior presumably to what is predicated of it. Again (2) we hold that 
<A NAME="432"></A>a substance is not contrary to another substance. How then can substance 
<A NAME="433"></A>be derived from what are not substances? Or how can non-substances be prior 
<A NAME="434"></A>to substance?
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>If then we accept both the former argument and this one, we must, 
<A NAME="436"></A>to preserve both, assume a third somewhat as the substratum of the contraries, 
<A NAME="437"></A>such as is spoken of by those who describe the All as one nature-water 
<A NAME="438"></A>or fire or what is intermediate between them. What is intermediate seems 
<A NAME="439"></A>preferable; for fire, earth, air, and water are already involved with pairs 
<A NAME="440"></A>of contraries. There is, therefore, much to be said for those who make 
<A NAME="441"></A>the underlying substance different from these four; of the rest, the next 
<A NAME="442"></A>best choice is air, as presenting sensible differences in a less degree 
<A NAME="443"></A>than the others; and after air, water. All, however, agree in this, that 
<A NAME="444"></A>they differentiate their One by means of the contraries, such as density 
<A NAME="445"></A>and rarity and more and less, which may of course be generalized, as has 
<A NAME="446"></A>already been said into excess and defect. Indeed this doctrine too (that 
<A NAME="447"></A>the One and excess and defect are the principles of things) would appear 
<A NAME="448"></A>to be of old standing, though in different forms; for the early thinkers 
<A NAME="449"></A>made the two the active and the one the passive principle, whereas some 
<A NAME="450"></A>of the more recent maintain the reverse.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>To suppose then that the elements are three in number would seem, 
<A NAME="452"></A>from these and similar considerations, a plausible view, as I said before. 
<A NAME="453"></A>On the other hand, the view that they are more than three in number would 
<A NAME="454"></A>seem to be untenable.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>For the one substratum is sufficient to be acted on; but if we 
<A NAME="456"></A>have four contraries, there will be two contrarieties, and we shall have 
<A NAME="457"></A>to suppose an intermediate nature for each pair separately. If, on the 
<A NAME="458"></A>other hand, the contrarieties, being two, can generate from each other, 
<A NAME="459"></A>the second contrariety will be superfluous. Moreover, it is impossible 
<A NAME="460"></A>that there should be more than one primary contrariety. For substance is 
<A NAME="461"></A>a single genus of being, so that the principles can differ only as prior 
<A NAME="462"></A>and posterior, not in genus; in a single genus there is always a single 
<A NAME="463"></A>contrariety, all the other contrarieties in it being held to be reducible 
<A NAME="464"></A>to one.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then that the number of elements is neither one nor 
<A NAME="466"></A>more than two or three; but whether two or three is, as I said, a question 
<A NAME="467"></A>of considerable difficulty.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="468"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>We will now give our own account, approaching the question first 
<A NAME="470"></A>with reference to becoming in its widest sense: for we shall be following 
<A NAME="471"></A>the natural order of inquiry if we speak first of common characteristics, 
<A NAME="472"></A>and then investigate the characteristics of special 
<A NAME="473"></A>cases.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>We say that one thing comes to be from another thing, and one sort 
<A NAME="475"></A>of thing from another sort of thing, both in the case of simple and of 
<A NAME="476"></A>complex things. I mean the following. We can say (1) 'man becomes musical', 
<A NAME="477"></A>(2) what is 'not-musical becomes musical', or (3), the 'not-musical man 
<A NAME="478"></A>becomes a musical man'. Now what becomes in (1) and (2)-'man' and 'not 
<A NAME="479"></A>musical'-I call simple, and what each becomes-'musical'-simple also. But 
<A NAME="480"></A>when (3) we say the 'not-musical man becomes a musical man', both what 
<A NAME="481"></A>becomes and what it becomes are complex.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>As regards one of these simple 'things that become' we say not 
<A NAME="483"></A>only 'this becomes so-and-so', but also 'from being this, comes to be so-and-so', 
<A NAME="484"></A>as 'from being not-musical comes to be musical'; as regards the other we 
<A NAME="485"></A>do not say this in all cases, as we do not say (1) 'from being a man he 
<A NAME="486"></A>came to be musical' but only 'the man became musical'.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>When a 'simple' thing is said to become something, in one case 
<A NAME="488"></A>(1) it survives through the process, in the other (2) it does not. For 
<A NAME="489"></A>man remains a man and is such even when he becomes musical, whereas what 
<A NAME="490"></A>is not musical or is unmusical does not continue to exist, either simply 
<A NAME="491"></A>or combined with the subject.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>These distinctions drawn, one can gather from surveying the various 
<A NAME="493"></A>cases of becoming in the way we are describing that, as we say, there must 
<A NAME="494"></A>always be an underlying something, namely that which becomes, and that 
<A NAME="495"></A>this, though always one numerically, in form at least is not one. (By that 
<A NAME="496"></A>I mean that it can be described in different ways.) For 'to be man' is 
<A NAME="497"></A>not the same as 'to be unmusical'. One part survives, the other does not: 
<A NAME="498"></A>what is not an opposite survives (for 'man' survives), but 'not-musical' 
<A NAME="499"></A>or 'unmusical' does not survive, nor does the compound of the two, namely 
<A NAME="500"></A>'unmusical man'.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>We speak of 'becoming that from this' instead of 'this becoming 
<A NAME="502"></A>that' more in the case of what does not survive the change-'becoming musical 
<A NAME="503"></A>from unmusical', not 'from man'-but there are exceptions, as we sometimes 
<A NAME="504"></A>use the latter form of expression even of what survives; we speak of 'a 
<A NAME="505"></A>statue coming to be from bronze', not of the 'bronze becoming a statue'. 
<A NAME="506"></A>The change, however, from an opposite which does not survive is described 
<A NAME="507"></A>indifferently in both ways, 'becoming that from this' or 'this becoming 
<A NAME="508"></A>that'. We say both that 'the unmusical becomes musical', and that 'from 
<A NAME="509"></A>unmusical he becomes musical'. And so both forms are used of the complex, 
<A NAME="510"></A>'becoming a musical man from an unmusical man', and unmusical man becoming 
<A NAME="511"></A>a musical man'.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>But there are different senses of 'coming to be'. In some cases 
<A NAME="513"></A>we do not use the expression 'come to be', but 'come to be so-and-so'. 
<A NAME="514"></A>Only substances are said to 'come to be' in the unqualified 
<A NAME="515"></A>sense.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>Now in all cases other than substance it is plain that there must 
<A NAME="517"></A>be some subject, namely, that which becomes. For we know that when a thing 
<A NAME="518"></A>comes to be of such a quantity or quality or in such a relation, time, 
<A NAME="519"></A>or place, a subject is always presupposed, since substance alone is not 
<A NAME="520"></A>predicated of another subject, but everything else of 
<A NAME="521"></A>substance.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>But that substances too, and anything else that can be said 'to 
<A NAME="523"></A>be' without qualification, come to be from some substratum, will appear 
<A NAME="524"></A>on examination. For we find in every case something that underlies from 
<A NAME="525"></A>which proceeds that which comes to be; for instance, animals and plants 
<A NAME="526"></A>from seed.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>Generally things which come to be, come to be in different ways: 
<A NAME="528"></A>(1) by change of shape, as a statue; (2) by addition, as things which grow; 
<A NAME="529"></A>(3) by taking away, as the Hermes from the stone; (4) by putting together, 
<A NAME="530"></A>as a house; (5) by alteration, as things which 'turn' in respect of their 
<A NAME="531"></A>material substance.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR>It is plain that these are all cases of coming to be from a 
<A NAME="533"></A>substratum.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>Thus, clearly, from what has been said, whatever comes to be is 
<A NAME="535"></A>always complex. There is, on the one hand, (a) something which comes into 
<A NAME="536"></A>existence, and again (b) something which becomes that-the latter (b) in 
<A NAME="537"></A>two senses, either the subject or the opposite. By the 'opposite' I mean 
<A NAME="538"></A>the 'unmusical', by the 'subject' 'man', and similarly I call the absence 
<A NAME="539"></A>of shape or form or order the 'opposite', and the bronze or stone or gold 
<A NAME="540"></A>the 'subject'.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR>Plainly then, if there are conditions and principles which constitute 
<A NAME="542"></A>natural objects and from which they primarily are or have come to be-have 
<A NAME="543"></A>come to be, I mean, what each is said to be in its essential nature, not 
<A NAME="544"></A>what each is in respect of a concomitant attribute-plainly, I say, everything 
<A NAME="545"></A>comes to be from both subject and form. For 'musical man' is composed (in 
<A NAME="546"></A>a way) of 'man' and 'musical': you can analyse it into the definitions 
<A NAME="547"></A>of its elements. It is clear then that what comes to be will come to be 
<A NAME="548"></A>from these elements.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>Now the subject is one numerically, though it is two in form. (For 
<A NAME="550"></A>it is the man, the gold-the 'matter' generally-that is counted, for it 
<A NAME="551"></A>is more of the nature of a 'this', and what comes to be does not come from 
<A NAME="552"></A>it in virtue of a concomitant attribute; the privation, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="553"></A>and the contrary are incidental in the process.) And the positive form 
<A NAME="554"></A>is one-the order, the acquired art of music, or any similar 
<A NAME="555"></A>predicate.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>There is a sense, therefore, in which we must declare the principles 
<A NAME="557"></A>to be two, and a sense in which they are three; a sense in which the contraries 
<A NAME="558"></A>are the principles-say for example the musical and the unmusical, the hot 
<A NAME="559"></A>and the cold, the tuned and the untuned-and a sense in which they are not, 
<A NAME="560"></A>since it is impossible for the contraries to be acted on by each other. 
<A NAME="561"></A>But this difficulty also is solved by the fact that the substratum is different 
<A NAME="562"></A>from the contraries, for it is itself not a contrary. The principles therefore 
<A NAME="563"></A>are, in a way, not more in number than the contraries, but as it were two, 
<A NAME="564"></A>nor yet precisely two, since there is a difference of essential nature, 
<A NAME="565"></A>but three. For 'to be man' is different from 'to be unmusical', and 'to 
<A NAME="566"></A>be unformed' from 'to be bronze'.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR>We have now stated the number of the principles of natural objects 
<A NAME="568"></A>which are subject to generation, and how the number is reached: and it 
<A NAME="569"></A>is clear that there must be a substratum for the contraries, and that the 
<A NAME="570"></A>contraries must be two. (Yet in another way of putting it this is not necessary, 
<A NAME="571"></A>as one of the contraries will serve to effect the change by its successive 
<A NAME="572"></A>absence and presence.)
<A NAME="573"></A><BR><BR>The underlying nature is an object of scientific knowledge, by 
<A NAME="574"></A>an analogy. For as the bronze is to the statue, the wood to the bed, or 
<A NAME="575"></A>the matter and the formless before receiving form to any thing which has 
<A NAME="576"></A>form, so is the underlying nature to substance, i.e. the 'this' or 
<A NAME="577"></A>existent.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>This then is one principle (though not one or existent in the same 
<A NAME="579"></A>sense as the 'this'), and the definition was one as we agreed; then further 
<A NAME="580"></A>there is its contrary, the privation. In what sense these are two, and 
<A NAME="581"></A>in what sense more, has been stated above. Briefly, we explained first 
<A NAME="582"></A>that only the contraries were principles, and later that a substratum was 
<A NAME="583"></A>indispensable, and that the principles were three; our last statement has 
<A NAME="584"></A>elucidated the difference between the contraries, the mutual relation of 
<A NAME="585"></A>the principles, and the nature of the substratum. Whether the form or the 
<A NAME="586"></A>substratum is the essential nature of a physical object is not yet clear. 
<A NAME="587"></A>But that the principles are three, and in what sense, and the way in which 
<A NAME="588"></A>each is a principle, is clear.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>So much then for the question of the number and the nature of the 
<A NAME="590"></A>principles.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="591"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>We will now proceed to show that the difficulty of the early thinkers, 
<A NAME="593"></A>as well as our own, is solved in this way alone.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR>The first of those who studied science were misled in their search 
<A NAME="595"></A>for truth and the nature of things by their inexperience, which as it were 
<A NAME="596"></A>thrust them into another path. So they say that none of the things that 
<A NAME="597"></A>are either comes to be or passes out of existence, because what comes to 
<A NAME="598"></A>be must do so either from what is or from what is not, both of which are 
<A NAME="599"></A>impossible. For what is cannot come to be (because it is already), and 
<A NAME="600"></A>from what is not nothing could have come to be (because something must 
<A NAME="601"></A>be present as a substratum). So too they exaggerated the consequence of 
<A NAME="602"></A>this, and went so far as to deny even the existence of a plurality of things, 
<A NAME="603"></A>maintaining that only Being itself is. Such then was their opinion, and 
<A NAME="604"></A>such the reason for its adoption.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>Our explanation on the other hand is that the phrases 'something 
<A NAME="606"></A>comes to be from what is or from what is not', 'what is not or what is 
<A NAME="607"></A>does something or has something done to it or becomes some particular thing', 
<A NAME="608"></A>are to be taken (in the first way of putting our explanation) in the same 
<A NAME="609"></A>sense as 'a doctor does something or has something done to him', 'is or 
<A NAME="610"></A>becomes something from being a doctor.' These expressions may be taken 
<A NAME="611"></A>in two senses, and so too, clearly, may 'from being', and 'being acts or 
<A NAME="612"></A>is acted on'. A doctor builds a house, not qua doctor, but qua housebuilder, 
<A NAME="613"></A>and turns gray, not qua doctor, but qua dark-haired. On the other hand 
<A NAME="614"></A>he doctors or fails to doctor qua doctor. But we are using words most appropriately 
<A NAME="615"></A>when we say that a doctor does something or undergoes something, or becomes 
<A NAME="616"></A>something from being a doctor, if he does, undergoes, or becomes qua doctor. 
<A NAME="617"></A>Clearly then also 'to come to be so-and-so from not-being' means 'qua 
<A NAME="618"></A>not-being'.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>It was through failure to make this distinction that those thinkers 
<A NAME="620"></A>gave the matter up, and through this error that they went so much farther 
<A NAME="621"></A>astray as to suppose that nothing else comes to be or exists apart from 
<A NAME="622"></A>Being itself, thus doing away with all becoming.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>We ourselves are in agreement with them in holding that nothing 
<A NAME="624"></A>can be said without qualification to come from what is not. But nevertheless 
<A NAME="625"></A>we maintain that a thing may 'come to be from what is not'-that is, in 
<A NAME="626"></A>a qualified sense. For a thing comes to be from the privation, which in 
<A NAME="627"></A>its own nature is not-being,-this not surviving as a constituent of the 
<A NAME="628"></A>result. Yet this causes surprise, and it is thought impossible that something 
<A NAME="629"></A>should come to be in the way described from what is 
<A NAME="630"></A>not.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>In the same way we maintain that nothing comes to be from being, 
<A NAME="632"></A>and that being does not come to be except in a qualified sense. In that 
<A NAME="633"></A>way, however, it does, just as animal might come to be from animal, and 
<A NAME="634"></A>an animal of a certain kind from an animal of a certain kind. Thus, suppose 
<A NAME="635"></A>a dog to come to be from a horse. The dog would then, it is true, come 
<A NAME="636"></A>to be from animal (as well as from an animal of a certain kind) but not 
<A NAME="637"></A>as animal, for that is already there. But if anything is to become an animal, 
<A NAME="638"></A>not in a qualified sense, it will not be from animal: and if being, not 
<A NAME="639"></A>from being-nor from not-being either, for it has been explained that by 
<A NAME="640"></A>'from not being' we mean from not-being qua not-being.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>Note further that we do not subvert the principle that everything 
<A NAME="642"></A>either is or is not.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR>This then is one way of solving the difficulty. Another consists 
<A NAME="644"></A>in pointing out that the same things can be explained in terms of potentiality 
<A NAME="645"></A>and actuality. But this has been done with greater precision elsewhere. 
<A NAME="646"></A>So, as we said, the difficulties which constrain people to deny the existence 
<A NAME="647"></A>of some of the things we mentioned are now solved. For it was this reason 
<A NAME="648"></A>which also caused some of the earlier thinkers to turn so far aside from 
<A NAME="649"></A>the road which leads to coming to be and passing away and change generally. 
<A NAME="650"></A>If they had come in sight of this nature, all their ignorance would have 
<A NAME="651"></A>been dispelled.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="652"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="653"></A><BR><BR>Others, indeed, have apprehended the nature in question, but not 
<A NAME="654"></A>adequately.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>In the first place they allow that a thing may come to be without 
<A NAME="656"></A>qualification from not being, accepting on this point the statement of 
<A NAME="657"></A>Parmenides. Secondly, they think that if the substratum is one numerically, 
<A NAME="658"></A>it must have also only a single potentiality-which is a very different 
<A NAME="659"></A>thing.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR>Now we distinguish matter and privation, and hold that one of these, 
<A NAME="661"></A>namely the matter, is not-being only in virtue of an attribute which it 
<A NAME="662"></A>has, while the privation in its own nature is not-being; and that the matter 
<A NAME="663"></A>is nearly, in a sense is, substance, while the privation in no sense is. 
<A NAME="664"></A>They, on the other hand, identify their Great and Small alike with not 
<A NAME="665"></A>being, and that whether they are taken together as one or separately. Their 
<A NAME="666"></A>triad is therefore of quite a different kind from ours. For they got so 
<A NAME="667"></A>far as to see that there must be some underlying nature, but they make 
<A NAME="668"></A>it one-for even if one philosopher makes a dyad of it, which he calls Great 
<A NAME="669"></A>and Small, the effect is the same, for he overlooked the other nature. 
<A NAME="670"></A>For the one which persists is a joint cause, with the form, of what comes 
<A NAME="671"></A>to be-a mother, as it were. But the negative part of the contrariety may 
<A NAME="672"></A>often seem, if you concentrate your attention on it as an evil agent, not 
<A NAME="673"></A>to exist at all.
<A NAME="674"></A><BR><BR>For admitting with them that there is something divine, good, and 
<A NAME="675"></A>desirable, we hold that there are two other principles, the one contrary 
<A NAME="676"></A>to it, the other such as of its own nature to desire and yearn for it. 
<A NAME="677"></A>But the consequence of their view is that the contrary desires its wtextinction. 
<A NAME="678"></A>Yet the form cannot desire itself, for it is not defective; nor can the 
<A NAME="679"></A>contrary desire it, for contraries are mutually destructive. The truth 
<A NAME="680"></A>is that what desires the form is matter, as the female desires the male 
<A NAME="681"></A>and the ugly the beautiful-only the ugly or the female not per se but per 
<A NAME="682"></A>accidens.
<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR>The matter comes to be and ceases to be in one sense, while in 
<A NAME="684"></A>another it does not. As that which contains the privation, it ceases to 
<A NAME="685"></A>be in its own nature, for what ceases to be-the privation-is contained 
<A NAME="686"></A>within it. But as potentiality it does not cease to be in its own nature, 
<A NAME="687"></A>but is necessarily outside the sphere of becoming and ceasing to be. For 
<A NAME="688"></A>if it came to be, something must have existed as a primary substratum from 
<A NAME="689"></A>which it should come and which should persist in it; but this is its own 
<A NAME="690"></A>special nature, so that it will be before coming to be. (For my definition 
<A NAME="691"></A>of matter is just this-the primary substratum of each thing, from which 
<A NAME="692"></A>it comes to be without qualification, and which persists in the result.) 
<A NAME="693"></A>And if it ceases to be it will pass into that at the last, so it will have 
<A NAME="694"></A>ceased to be before ceasing to be.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>The accurate determination of the first principle in respect of 
<A NAME="696"></A>form, whether it is one or many and what it is or what they are, is the 
<A NAME="697"></A>province of the primary type of science; so these questions may stand over 
<A NAME="698"></A>till then. But of the natural, i.e. perishable, forms we shall speak in 
<A NAME="699"></A>the expositions which follow.
<A NAME="700"></A><BR><BR>The above, then, may be taken as sufficient to establish that there 
<A NAME="701"></A>are principles and what they are and how many there are. Now let us make 
<A NAME="702"></A>a fresh start and proceed.
