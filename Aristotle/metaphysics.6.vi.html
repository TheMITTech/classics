<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>"WE are seeking the principles and the causes of the things that 
<A NAME="13"></A>are, and obviously of them qua being. For, while there is a cause of health 
<A NAME="14"></A>and of good condition, and the objects of mathematics have first principles 
<A NAME="15"></A>and elements and causes, and in general every science which is ratiocinative 
<A NAME="16"></A>or at all involves reasoning deals with causes and principles, more or 
<A NAME="17"></A>less precise, all these sciences mark off some particular being-some genus, 
<A NAME="18"></A>and inquire into this, but not into being simply nor qua being, nor do 
<A NAME="19"></A>they offer any discussion of the essence of the things of which they treat; 
<A NAME="20"></A>but starting from the essence-some making it plain to the senses, others 
<A NAME="21"></A>assuming it as a hypothesis-they then demonstrate, more or less cogently, 
<A NAME="22"></A>the essential attributes of the genus with which they deal. It is obvious, 
<A NAME="23"></A>therefore, that such an induction yields no demonstration of substance 
<A NAME="24"></A>or of the essence, but some other way of exhibiting it. And similarly the 
<A NAME="25"></A>sciences omit the question whether the genus with which they deal exists 
<A NAME="26"></A>or does not exist, because it belongs to the same kind of thinking to show 
<A NAME="27"></A>what it is and that it is. <BR><BR>"And since natural science, like other 
<A NAME="28"></A>sciences, is in fact about one class of being, i.e. to that sort of substance 
<A NAME="29"></A>which has the principle of its movement and rest present in itself, evidently 
<A NAME="30"></A>it is neither practical nor productive. For in the case of things made 
<A NAME="31"></A>the principle is in the maker-it is either reason or art or some faculty, 
<A NAME="32"></A>while in the case of things done it is in the doer-viz. will, for that 
<A NAME="33"></A>which is done and that which is willed are the same. Therefore, if all 
<A NAME="34"></A>thought is either practical or productive or theoretical, physics must 
<A NAME="35"></A>be a theoretical science, but it will theorize about such being as admits 
<A NAME="36"></A>of being moved, and about substance-as-defined for the most part only as 
<A NAME="37"></A>not separable from matter. Now, we must not fail to notice the mode of 
<A NAME="38"></A>being of the essence and of its definition, for, without this, inquiry 
<A NAME="39"></A>is but idle. Of things defined, i.e. of 'whats', some are like 'snub', 
<A NAME="40"></A>and some like 'concave'. And these differ because 'snub' is bound up with 
<A NAME="41"></A>matter (for what is snub is a concave nose), while concavity is independent 
<A NAME="42"></A>of perceptible matter. If then all natural things are a analogous to the 
<A NAME="43"></A>snub in their nature; e.g. nose, eye, face, flesh, bone, and, in general, 
<A NAME="44"></A>animal; leaf, root, bark, and, in general, plant (for none of these can 
<A NAME="45"></A>be defined without reference to movement-they always have matter), it is 
<A NAME="46"></A>clear how we must seek and define the 'what' in the case of natural objects, 
<A NAME="47"></A>and also that it belongs to the student of nature to study even soul in 
<A NAME="48"></A>a certain sense, i.e. so much of it as is not independent of matter. <BR><BR>"That 
<A NAME="49"></A>physics, then, is a theoretical science, is plain from these considerations. 
<A NAME="50"></A>Mathematics also, however, is theoretical; but whether its objects are 
<A NAME="51"></A>immovable and separable from matter, is not at present clear; still, it 
<A NAME="52"></A>is clear that some mathematical theorems consider them qua immovable and 
<A NAME="53"></A>qua separable from matter. But if there is something which is eternal and 
<A NAME="54"></A>immovable and separable, clearly the knowledge of it belongs to a theoretical 
<A NAME="55"></A>science,-not, however, to physics (for physics deals with certain movable 
<A NAME="56"></A>things) nor to mathematics, but to a science prior to both. For physics 
<A NAME="57"></A>deals with things which exist separately but are not immovable, and some 
<A NAME="58"></A>parts of mathematics deal with things which are immovable but presumably 
<A NAME="59"></A>do not exist separately, but as embodied in matter; while the first science 
<A NAME="60"></A>deals with things which both exist separately and are immovable. Now all 
<A NAME="61"></A>causes must be eternal, but especially these; for they are the causes that 
<A NAME="62"></A>operate on so much of the divine as appears to us. There must, then, be 
<A NAME="63"></A>three theoretical philosophies, mathematics, physics, and what we may call 
<A NAME="64"></A>theology, since it is obvious that if the divine is present anywhere, it 
<A NAME="65"></A>is present in things of this sort. And the highest science must deal with 
<A NAME="66"></A>the highest genus. Thus, while the theoretical sciences are more to be 
<A NAME="67"></A>desired than the other sciences, this is more to be desired than the other 
<A NAME="68"></A>theoretical sciences. For one might raise the question whether first philosophy 
<A NAME="69"></A>is universal, or deals with one genus, i.e. some one kind of being; for 
<A NAME="70"></A>not even the mathematical sciences are all alike in this respect,-geometry 
<A NAME="71"></A>and astronomy deal with a certain particular kind of thing, while universal 
<A NAME="72"></A>mathematics applies alike to all. We answer that if there is no substance 
<A NAME="73"></A>other than those which are formed by nature, natural science will be the 
<A NAME="74"></A>first science; but if there is an immovable substance, the science of this 
<A NAME="75"></A>must be prior and must be first philosophy, and universal in this way, 
<A NAME="76"></A>because it is first. And it will belong to this to consider being qua being-both 
<A NAME="77"></A>what it is and the attributes which belong to it qua 
<A NAME="78"></A>being.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="79"></A><B>Part 2</B>
<A NAME="80"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>"But since the unqualified term 'being' has several meanings, of 
<A NAME="82"></A>which one was seen' to be the accidental, and another the true ('non-being' 
<A NAME="83"></A>being the false), while besides these there are the figures of predication 
<A NAME="84"></A>(e.g. the 'what', quality, quantity, place, time, and any similar meanings 
<A NAME="85"></A>which 'being' may have), and again besides all these there is that which 
<A NAME="86"></A>'is' potentially or actually:-since 'being' has many meanings, we must 
<A NAME="87"></A>say regarding the accidental, that there can be no scientific treatment 
<A NAME="88"></A>of it. This is confirmed by the fact that no science practical, productive, 
<A NAME="89"></A>or theoretical troubles itself about it. For on the one hand he who produces 
<A NAME="90"></A>a house does not produce all the attributes that come into being along 
<A NAME="91"></A>with the house; for these are innumerable; the house that has been made 
<A NAME="92"></A>may quite well be pleasant for some people, hurtful for some, and useful 
<A NAME="93"></A>to others, and different-to put it shortly from all things that are; and 
<A NAME="94"></A>the science of building does not aim at producing any of these attributes. 
<A NAME="95"></A>And in the same way the geometer does not consider the attributes which 
<A NAME="96"></A>attach thus to figures, nor whether 'triangle' is different from 'triangle 
<A NAME="97"></A>whose angles are equal to two right angles'.-And this happens naturally 
<A NAME="98"></A>enough; for the accidental is practically a mere name. And so Plato was 
<A NAME="99"></A>in a sense not wrong in ranking sophistic as dealing with that which is 
<A NAME="100"></A>not. For the arguments of the sophists deal, we may say, above all with 
<A NAME="101"></A>the accidental; e.g. the question whether 'musical' and 'lettered' are 
<A NAME="102"></A>different or the same, and whether 'musical Coriscus' and 'Coriscus' are 
<A NAME="103"></A>the same, and whether 'everything which is, but is not eternal, has come 
<A NAME="104"></A>to be', with the paradoxical conclusion that if one who was musical has 
<A NAME="105"></A>come to be lettered, he must also have been lettered and have come to be 
<A NAME="106"></A>musical, and all the other arguments of this sort; the accidental is obviously 
<A NAME="107"></A>akin to non-being. And this is clear also from arguments such as the following: 
<A NAME="108"></A>things which are in another sense come into being and pass out of being 
<A NAME="109"></A>by a process, but things which are accidentally do not. But still we must, 
<A NAME="110"></A>as far as we can, say further, regarding the accidental, what its nature 
<A NAME="111"></A>is and from what cause it proceeds; for it will perhaps at the same time 
<A NAME="112"></A>become clear why there is no science of it. <BR><BR>"Since, among things 
<A NAME="113"></A>which are, some are always in the same state and are of necessity (not 
<A NAME="114"></A>necessity in the sense of compulsion but that which we assert of things 
<A NAME="115"></A>because they cannot be otherwise), and some are not of necessity nor always, 
<A NAME="116"></A>but for the most part, this is the principle and this the cause of the 
<A NAME="117"></A>existence of the accidental; for that which is neither always nor for the 
<A NAME="118"></A>most part, we call accidental. For instance, if in the dog-days there is 
<A NAME="119"></A>wintry and cold weather, we say this is an accident, but not if there is 
<A NAME="120"></A>sultry heat, because the latter is always or for the most part so, but 
<A NAME="121"></A>not the former. And it is an accident that a man is pale (for this is neither 
<A NAME="122"></A>always nor for the most part so), but it is not by accident that he is 
<A NAME="123"></A>an animal. And that the builder produces health is an accident, because 
<A NAME="124"></A>it is the nature not of the builder but of the doctor to do this,-but the 
<A NAME="125"></A>builder happened to be a doctor. Again, a confectioner, aiming at giving 
<A NAME="126"></A>pleasure, may make something wholesome, but not in virtue of the confectioner's 
<A NAME="127"></A>art; and therefore we say 'it was an accident', and while there is a sense 
<A NAME="128"></A>in which he makes it, in the unqualified sense he does not. For to other 
<A NAME="129"></A>things answer faculties productive of them, but to accidental results there 
<A NAME="130"></A>corresponds no determinate art nor faculty; for of things which are or 
<A NAME="131"></A>come to be by accident, the cause also is accidental. Therefore, since 
<A NAME="132"></A>not all things either are or come to be of necessity and always, but, the 
<A NAME="133"></A>majority of things are for the most part, the accidental must exist; for 
<A NAME="134"></A>instance a pale man is not always nor for the most part musical, but since 
<A NAME="135"></A>this sometimes happens, it must be accidental (if not, everything will 
<A NAME="136"></A>be of necessity). The matter, therefore, which is capable of being otherwise 
<A NAME="137"></A>than as it usually is, must be the cause of the accidental. And we must 
<A NAME="138"></A>take as our starting-point the question whether there is nothing that is 
<A NAME="139"></A>neither always nor for the most part. Surely this is impossible. There 
<A NAME="140"></A>is, then, besides these something which is fortuitous and accidental. But 
<A NAME="141"></A>while the usual exists, can nothing be said to be always, or are there 
<A NAME="142"></A>eternal things? This must be considered later,' but that there is no science 
<A NAME="143"></A>of the accidental is obvious; for all science is either of that which is 
<A NAME="144"></A>always or of that which is for the most part. (For how else is one to learn 
<A NAME="145"></A>or to teach another? The thing must be determined as occurring either always 
<A NAME="146"></A>or for the most part, e.g. that honey-water is useful for a patient in 
<A NAME="147"></A>a fever is true for the most part.) But that which is contrary to the usual 
<A NAME="148"></A>law science will be unable to state, i.e. when the thing does not happen, 
<A NAME="149"></A>e.g.'on the day of new moon'; for even that which happens on the day of 
<A NAME="150"></A>new moon happens then either always or for the most part; but the accidental 
<A NAME="151"></A>is contrary to such laws. We have stated, then, what the accidental is, 
<A NAME="152"></A>and from what cause it arises, and that there is no science which deals 
<A NAME="153"></A>with it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="154"></A><B>Part 3</B>
<A NAME="155"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>"That there are principles and causes which are generable and destructible 
<A NAME="157"></A>without ever being in course of being generated or destroyed, is obvious. 
<A NAME="158"></A>For otherwise all things will be of necessity, since that which is being 
<A NAME="159"></A>generated or destroyed must have a cause which is not accidentally its 
<A NAME="160"></A>cause. Will A exist or not? It will if B happens; and if not, not. And 
<A NAME="161"></A>B will exist if C happens. And thus if time is constantly subtracted from 
<A NAME="162"></A>a limited extent of time, one will obviously come to the present. This 
<A NAME="163"></A>man, then, will die by violence, if he goes out; and he will do this if 
<A NAME="164"></A>he gets thirsty; and he will get thirsty if something else happens; and 
<A NAME="165"></A>thus we shall come to that which is now present, or to some past event. 
<A NAME="166"></A>For instance, he will go out if he gets thirsty; and he will get thirsty 
<A NAME="167"></A>if he is eating pungent food; and this is either the case or not; so that 
<A NAME="168"></A>he will of necessity die, or of necessity not die. And similarly if one 
<A NAME="169"></A>jumps over to past events, the same account will hold good; for this-I 
<A NAME="170"></A>mean the past condition-is already present in something. Everything, therefore, 
<A NAME="171"></A>that will be, will be of necessity; e.g. it is necessary that he who lives 
<A NAME="172"></A>shall one day die; for already some condition has come into existence, 
<A NAME="173"></A>e.g. the presence of contraries in the same body. But whether he is to 
<A NAME="174"></A>die by disease or by violence is not yet determined, but depends on the 
<A NAME="175"></A>happening of something else. Clearly then the process goes back to a certain 
<A NAME="176"></A>starting-point, but this no longer points to something further. This then 
<A NAME="177"></A>will be the starting-point for the fortuitous, and will have nothing else 
<A NAME="178"></A>as cause of its coming to be. But to what sort of starting-point and what 
<A NAME="179"></A>sort of cause we thus refer the fortuitous-whether to matter or to the 
<A NAME="180"></A>purpose or to the motive power, must be carefully considered.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="181"></A><B>Part 4</B>
<A NAME="182"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>"Let us dismiss accidental being; for we have sufficiently determined 
<A NAME="184"></A>its nature. But since that which is in the sense of being true, or is not 
<A NAME="185"></A>in the sense of being false, depends on combination and separation, and 
<A NAME="186"></A>truth and falsity together depend on the allocation of a pair of contradictory 
<A NAME="187"></A>judgements (for the true judgement affirms where the subject and predicate 
<A NAME="188"></A>really are combined, and denies where they are separated, while the false 
<A NAME="189"></A>judgement has the opposite of this allocation; it is another question, 
<A NAME="190"></A>how it happens that we think things together or apart; by 'together' and 
<A NAME="191"></A>'apart' I mean thinking them so that there is no succession in the thoughts 
<A NAME="192"></A>but they become a unity); for falsity and truth are not in things-it is 
<A NAME="193"></A>not as if the good were true, and the bad were in itself false-but in thought; 
<A NAME="194"></A>while with regard to simple concepts and 'whats' falsity and truth do not 
<A NAME="195"></A>exist even in thought--this being so, we must consider later what has to 
<A NAME="196"></A>be discussed with regard to that which is or is not in this sense. But 
<A NAME="197"></A>since the combination and the separation are in thought and not in the 
<A NAME="198"></A>things, and that which is in this sense is a different sort of 'being' 
<A NAME="199"></A>from the things that are in the full sense (for the thought attaches or 
<A NAME="200"></A>removes either the subject's 'what' or its having a certain quality or 
<A NAME="201"></A>quantity or something else), that which is accidentally and that which 
<A NAME="202"></A>is in the sense of being true must be dismissed. For the cause of the former 
<A NAME="203"></A>is indeterminate, and that of the latter is some affection of the thought, 
<A NAME="204"></A>and both are related to the remaining genus of being, and do not indicate 
<A NAME="205"></A>the existence of any separate class of being. Therefore let these be dismissed, 
<A NAME="206"></A>and let us consider the causes and the principles of being itself, qua 
<A NAME="207"></A>being. (It was clear in our discussion of the various meanings of terms, 
<A NAME="208"></A>that 'being' has several meanings.)
