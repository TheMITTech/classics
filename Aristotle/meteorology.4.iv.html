<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>We have explained that the qualities that constitute the elements are four, 
<A NAME="12"></A>and that their combinations determine the number of the elements to be 
<A NAME="13"></A>four.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>Two of the qualities, the hot and the cold, are active; two, the 
<A NAME="15"></A>dry and the moist, passive. We can satisfy ourselves of this by looking 
<A NAME="16"></A>at instances. In every case heat and cold determine, conjoin, and change 
<A NAME="17"></A>things of the same kind and things of different kinds, moistening, drying, 
<A NAME="18"></A>hardening, and softening them. Things dry and moist, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="19"></A>both in isolation and when present together in the same body are the subjects 
<A NAME="20"></A>of that determination and of the other affections enumerated. The account 
<A NAME="21"></A>we give of the qualities when we define their character shows this too. 
<A NAME="22"></A>Hot and cold we describe as active, for 'congregating' is essentially a 
<A NAME="23"></A>species of 'being active': moist and dry are passive, for it is in virtue 
<A NAME="24"></A>of its being acted upon in a certain way that a thing is said to be 'easy 
<A NAME="25"></A>to determine' or 'difficult to determine'. So it is clear that some of 
<A NAME="26"></A>the qualities are active and some passive.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>Next we must describe the operations of the active qualities and 
<A NAME="28"></A>the forms taken by the passive. First of all, true becoming, that is, natural 
<A NAME="29"></A>change, is always the work of these powers and so is the corresponding 
<A NAME="30"></A>natural destruction; and this becoming and this destruction are found in 
<A NAME="31"></A>plants and animals and their parts. True natural becoming is a change introduced 
<A NAME="32"></A>by these powers into the matter underlying a given thing when they are 
<A NAME="33"></A>in a certain ratio to that matter, which is the passive qualities we have 
<A NAME="34"></A>mentioned. When the hot and the cold are masters of the matter they generate 
<A NAME="35"></A>a thing: if they are not, and the failure is partial, the object is imperfectly 
<A NAME="36"></A>boiled or otherwise unconcocted. But the strictest general opposite of 
<A NAME="37"></A>true becoming is putrefaction. All natural destruction is on the way to 
<A NAME="38"></A>it, as are, for instance, growing old or growing dry. Putrescence is the 
<A NAME="39"></A>end of all these things, that is of all natural objects, except such as 
<A NAME="40"></A>are destroyed by violence: you can burn, for instance, flesh, bone, or 
<A NAME="41"></A>anything else, but the natural course of their destruction ends in putrefaction. 
<A NAME="42"></A>Hence things that putrefy begin by being moist and end by being dry. For 
<A NAME="43"></A>the moist and the dry were their matter, and the operation of the active 
<A NAME="44"></A>qualities caused the dry to be determined by the moist.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>Destruction supervenes when the determined gets the better of the 
<A NAME="46"></A>determining by the help of the environment (though in a special sense the 
<A NAME="47"></A>word putrefaction is applied to partial destruction, when a thing's nature 
<A NAME="48"></A>is perverted). Hence everything, except fire, is liable to putrefy; for 
<A NAME="49"></A>earth, water, and air putrefy, being all of them matter relatively to fire. 
<A NAME="50"></A>The definition of putrefaction is: the destruction of the peculiar and 
<A NAME="51"></A>natural heat in any moist subject by external heat, that is, by the heat 
<A NAME="52"></A>of the environment. So since lack of heat is the ground of this affection 
<A NAME="53"></A>and everything in as far as it lacks heat is cold, both heat and cold will 
<A NAME="54"></A>be the causes of putrefaction, which will be due indifferently to cold 
<A NAME="55"></A>in the putrefying subject or to heat in the environment.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>This explains why everything that putrefies grows drier and ends 
<A NAME="57"></A>by becoming earth or dung. The subject's own heat departs and causes the 
<A NAME="58"></A>natural moisture to evaporate with it, and then there is nothing left to 
<A NAME="59"></A>draw in moisture, for it is a thing's peculiar heat that attracts moisture 
<A NAME="60"></A>and draws it in. Again, putrefaction takes place less in cold that in hot 
<A NAME="61"></A>seasons, for in winter the surrounding air and water contain but little 
<A NAME="62"></A>heat and it has no power, but in summer there is more. Again, what is frozen 
<A NAME="63"></A>does not putrefy, for its cold is greater that the heat of the air and 
<A NAME="64"></A>so is not mastered, whereas what affects a thing does master it. Nor does 
<A NAME="65"></A>that which is boiling or hot putrefy, for the heat in the air being less 
<A NAME="66"></A>than that in the object does not prevail over it or set up any change. 
<A NAME="67"></A>So too anything that is flowing or in motion is less apt to putrefy than 
<A NAME="68"></A>a thing at rest, for the motion set up by the heat in the air is weaker 
<A NAME="69"></A>than that pre-existing in the object, and so it causes no change. For the 
<A NAME="70"></A>same reason a great quantity of a thing putrefies less readily than a little, 
<A NAME="71"></A>for the greater quantity contains too much proper fire and cold for the 
<A NAME="72"></A>corresponding qualities in the environment to get the better of. Hence, 
<A NAME="73"></A>the sea putrefies quickly when broken up into parts, but not as a whole; 
<A NAME="74"></A>and all other waters likewise. Animals too are generated in putrefying 
<A NAME="75"></A>bodies, because the heat that has been secreted, being natural, organizes 
<A NAME="76"></A>the particles secreted with it.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>So much for the nature of becoming and of destruction.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="78"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>We must now describe the next kinds of processes which the qualities 
<A NAME="80"></A>already mentioned set up in actually existing natural objects as 
<A NAME="81"></A>matter.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>Of these concoction is due to heat; its species are ripening, boiling, 
<A NAME="83"></A>broiling. Inconcoction is due to cold and its species are rawness, imperfect 
<A NAME="84"></A>boiling, imperfect broiling. (We must recognize that the things are not 
<A NAME="85"></A>properly denoted by these words: the various classes of similar objects 
<A NAME="86"></A>have no names universally applicable to them; consequently we must think 
<A NAME="87"></A>of the species enumerated as being not what those words denote but something 
<A NAME="88"></A>like it.) Let us say what each of them is. Concoction is a process in which 
<A NAME="89"></A>the natural and proper heat of an object perfects the corresponding passive 
<A NAME="90"></A>qualities, which are the proper matter of any given object. For when concoction 
<A NAME="91"></A>has taken place we say that a thing has been perfected and has come to 
<A NAME="92"></A>be itself. It is the proper heat of a thing that sets up this perfecting, 
<A NAME="93"></A>though external influences may contribute in some degrees to its fulfilment. 
<A NAME="94"></A>Baths, for instance, and other things of the kind contribute to the digestion 
<A NAME="95"></A>of food, but the primary cause is the proper heat of the body. In some 
<A NAME="96"></A>cases of concoction the end of the process is the nature of the thing-nature, 
<A NAME="97"></A>that is, in the sense of the formal cause and essence. In other cases it 
<A NAME="98"></A>leads to some presupposed state which is attained when the moisture has 
<A NAME="99"></A>acquired certain properties or a certain magnitude in the process of being 
<A NAME="100"></A>broiled or boiled or of putrefying, or however else it is being heated. 
<A NAME="101"></A>This state is the end, for when it has been reached the thing has some 
<A NAME="102"></A>use and we say that concoction has taken place. Must is an instance of 
<A NAME="103"></A>this, and the matter in boils when it becomes purulent, and tears when 
<A NAME="104"></A>they become rheum, and so with the rest.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>Concoction ensues whenever the matter, the moisture, is mastered. 
<A NAME="106"></A>For the matter is what is determined by the heat connatural to the object, 
<A NAME="107"></A>and as long as the ratio between them exists in it a thing maintains its 
<A NAME="108"></A>nature. Hence things like the liquid and solid excreta and ejecta in general 
<A NAME="109"></A>are signs of health, and concoction is said to have taken place in them, 
<A NAME="110"></A>for they show that the proper heat has got the better of the indeterminate 
<A NAME="111"></A>matter.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>Things that undergo a process of concoction necessarily become 
<A NAME="113"></A>thicker and hotter, for the action of heat is to make things more compact, 
<A NAME="114"></A>thicker, and drier.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>This then is the nature of concoction: but inconcoction is an imperfect 
<A NAME="116"></A>state due to lack of proper heat, that is, to cold. That of which the imperfect 
<A NAME="117"></A>state is, is the corresponding passive qualities which are the natural 
<A NAME="118"></A>matter of anything.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>So much for the definition of concoction and 
<A NAME="120"></A>inconcoction.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="121"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>Ripening is a sort of concoction; for we call it ripening when 
<A NAME="123"></A>there is a concoction of the nutriment in fruit. And since concoction is 
<A NAME="124"></A>a sort of perfecting, the process of ripening is perfect when the seeds 
<A NAME="125"></A>in fruit are able to reproduce the fruit in which they are found; for in 
<A NAME="126"></A>all other cases as well this is what we mean by 'perfect'. This is what 
<A NAME="127"></A>'ripening' means when the word is applied to fruit. However, many other 
<A NAME="128"></A>things that have undergone concoction are said to be 'ripe', the general 
<A NAME="129"></A>character of the process being the same, though the word is applied by 
<A NAME="130"></A>an extension of meaning. The reason for this extension is, as we explained 
<A NAME="131"></A>before, that the various modes in which natural heat and cold perfect the 
<A NAME="132"></A>matter they determine have not special names appropriated to them. In the 
<A NAME="133"></A>case of boils and phlegm, and the like, the process of ripening is the 
<A NAME="134"></A>concoction of the moisture in them by their natural heat, for only that 
<A NAME="135"></A>which gets the better of matter can determine it. So everything that ripens 
<A NAME="136"></A>is condensed from a spirituous into a watery state, and from a watery into 
<A NAME="137"></A>an earthy state, and in general from being rare becomes dense. In this 
<A NAME="138"></A>process the nature of the thing that is ripening incorporates some of the 
<A NAME="139"></A>matter in itself, and some it rejects. So much for the definition of 
<A NAME="140"></A>ripening.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>Rawness is its opposite and is therefore an imperfect concoction 
<A NAME="142"></A>of the nutriment in the fruit, namely, of the undetermined moisture. Consequently 
<A NAME="143"></A>a raw thing is either spirituous or watery or contains both spirit and 
<A NAME="144"></A>water. Ripening being a kind of perfecting, rawness will be an imperfect 
<A NAME="145"></A>state, and this state is due to a lack of natural heat and its disproportion 
<A NAME="146"></A>to the moisture that is undergoing the process of ripening. (Nothing moist 
<A NAME="147"></A>ripens without the admixture of some dry matter: water alone of liquids 
<A NAME="148"></A>does not thicken.) This disproportion may be due either to defect of heat 
<A NAME="149"></A>or to excess of the matter to be determined: hence the juice of raw things 
<A NAME="150"></A>is thin, cold rather than hot, and unfit for food or drink. Rawness, like 
<A NAME="151"></A>ripening, is used to denote a variety of states. Thus the liquid and solid 
<A NAME="152"></A>excreta and catarrhs are called raw for the same reason, for in every case 
<A NAME="153"></A>the word is applied to things because their heat has not got the mastery 
<A NAME="154"></A>in them and compacted them. If we go further, brick is called raw and so 
<A NAME="155"></A>is milk and many other things too when they are such as to admit of being 
<A NAME="156"></A>changed and compacted by heat but have remained unaffected. Hence, while 
<A NAME="157"></A>we speak of 'boiled' water, we cannot speak of raw water, since it does 
<A NAME="158"></A>not thicken. We have now defined ripening and rawness and assigned their 
<A NAME="159"></A>causes.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>Boiling is, in general, a concoction by moist heat of the indeterminate 
<A NAME="161"></A>matter contained in the moisture of the thing boiled, and the word is strictly 
<A NAME="162"></A>applicable only to things boiled in the way of cooking. The indeterminate 
<A NAME="163"></A>matter, as we said, will be either spirituous or watery. The cause of the 
<A NAME="164"></A>concoction is the fire contained in the moisture; for what is cooked in 
<A NAME="165"></A>a frying-pan is broiled: it is the heat outside that affects it and, as 
<A NAME="166"></A>for the moisture in which it is contained, it dries this up and draws it 
<A NAME="167"></A>into itself. But a thing that is being boiled behaves in the opposite way: 
<A NAME="168"></A>the moisture contained in it is drawn out of it by the heat in the liquid 
<A NAME="169"></A>outside. Hence boiled meats are drier than broiled; for, in boiling, things 
<A NAME="170"></A>do not draw the moisture into themselves, since the external heat gets 
<A NAME="171"></A>the better of the internal: if the internal heat had got the better it 
<A NAME="172"></A>would have drawn the moisture to itself. Not every body admits of the process 
<A NAME="173"></A>of boiling: if there is no moisture in it, it does not (for instance, stones), 
<A NAME="174"></A>nor does it if there is moisture in it but the density of the body is too 
<A NAME="175"></A>great for it-to-be mastered, as in the case of wood. But only those bodies 
<A NAME="176"></A>can be boiled that contain moisture which can be acted on by the heat contained 
<A NAME="177"></A>in the liquid outside. It is true that gold and wood and many other things 
<A NAME="178"></A>are said to be 'boiled': but this is a stretch of the meaning of the word, 
<A NAME="179"></A>though the kind of thing intended is the same, the reason for the usage 
<A NAME="180"></A>being that the various cases have no names appropriated to them. Liquids 
<A NAME="181"></A>too, like milk and must, are said to undergo a process of 'boiling' when 
<A NAME="182"></A>the external fire that surrounds and heats them changes the savour in the 
<A NAME="183"></A>liquid into a given form, the process being thus in a way like what we 
<A NAME="184"></A>have called boiling.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>The end of the things that undergo boiling, or indeed any form 
<A NAME="186"></A>of concoction, is not always the same: some are meant to be eaten, some 
<A NAME="187"></A>drunk, and some are intended for other uses; for instance dyes, too, are 
<A NAME="188"></A>said to be 'boiled'.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>All those things then admit of 'boiling' which can grow denser, 
<A NAME="190"></A>smaller, or heavier; also those which do that with a part of themselves 
<A NAME="191"></A>and with a part do the opposite, dividing in such a way that one portion 
<A NAME="192"></A>thickens while the other grows thinner, like milk when it divides into 
<A NAME="193"></A>whey and curd. Oil by itself is affected in none of these ways, and therefore 
<A NAME="194"></A>cannot be said to admit of 'boiling'. Such then is the pfcies of concoction 
<A NAME="195"></A>known as 'boiling', and the process is the same in an artificial and in 
<A NAME="196"></A>a natural instrument, for the cause will be the same in every 
<A NAME="197"></A>case.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>Imperfect boiling is the form of inconcoction opposed to boiling. 
<A NAME="199"></A>Now the opposite of boiling properly so called is an inconcoction of the 
<A NAME="200"></A>undetermined matter in a body due to lack of heat in the surrounding liquid. 
<A NAME="201"></A>(Lack of heat implies, as we have pointed out, the presence of cold.) The 
<A NAME="202"></A>motion which causes imperfect boiling is different from that which causes 
<A NAME="203"></A>boiling, for the heat which operates the concoction is driven out. The 
<A NAME="204"></A>lack of heat is due either to the amount of cold in the liquid or to the 
<A NAME="205"></A>quantity of moisture in the object undergoing the process of boiling. Where 
<A NAME="206"></A>either of these conditions is realized the heat in the surrounding liquid 
<A NAME="207"></A>is too great to have no effect at all, but too small to carry out the process 
<A NAME="208"></A>of concocting uniformly and thoroughly. Hence things are harder when they 
<A NAME="209"></A>are imperfectly boiled than when they are boiled, and the moisture in them 
<A NAME="210"></A>more distinct from the solid parts. So much for the definition and causes 
<A NAME="211"></A>of boiling and imperfect boiling.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>Broiling is concoction by dry foreign heat. Hence if a man were 
<A NAME="213"></A>to boil a thing but the change and concoction in it were due, not to the 
<A NAME="214"></A>heat of the liquid but to that of the fire, the thing will have been broiled 
<A NAME="215"></A>and not boiled when the process has been carried to completion: if the 
<A NAME="216"></A>process has gone too far we use the word 'scorched' to describe it. If 
<A NAME="217"></A>the process leaves the thing drier at the end the agent has been dry heat. 
<A NAME="218"></A>Hence the outside is drier than the inside, the opposite being true of 
<A NAME="219"></A>things boiled. Where the process is artificial, broiling is more difficult 
<A NAME="220"></A>than boiling, for it is difficult to heat the inside and the outside uniformly, 
<A NAME="221"></A>since the parts nearer to the fire are the first to get dry and consequently 
<A NAME="222"></A>get more intensely dry. In this way the outer pores contract and the moisture 
<A NAME="223"></A>in the thing cannot be secreted but is shut in by the closing of the pores. 
<A NAME="224"></A>Now broiling and boiling are artificial processes, but the same general 
<A NAME="225"></A>kind of thing, as we said, is found in nature too. The affections produced 
<A NAME="226"></A>are similar though they lack a name; for art imitates nature. For instance, 
<A NAME="227"></A>the concoction of food in the body is like boiling, for it takes place 
<A NAME="228"></A>in a hot and moist medium and the agent is the heat of the body. So, too, 
<A NAME="229"></A>certain forms of indigestion are like imperfect boiling. And it is not 
<A NAME="230"></A>true that animals are generated in the concoction of food, as some say. 
<A NAME="231"></A>Really they are generated in the excretion which putrefies in the lower 
<A NAME="232"></A>belly, and they ascend afterwards. For concoction goes on in the upper 
<A NAME="233"></A>belly but the excretion putrefies in the lower: the reason for this has 
<A NAME="234"></A>been explained elsewhere.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>We have seen that the opposite of boiling is imperfect boiling: 
<A NAME="236"></A>now there is something correspondingly opposed to the species of concoction 
<A NAME="237"></A>called broiling, but it is more difficult to find a name for it. It would 
<A NAME="238"></A>be the kind of thing that would happen if there were imperfect broiling 
<A NAME="239"></A>instead of broiling proper through lack of heat due to deficiency in the 
<A NAME="240"></A>external fire or to the quantity of water in the thing undergoing the process. 
<A NAME="241"></A>For then we should get too much heat for no effect to be produced, but 
<A NAME="242"></A>too little for concoction to take place.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>We have now explained concoction and inconcoction, ripening and 
<A NAME="244"></A>rawness, boiling and broiling, and their opposites.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="245"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>We must now describe the forms taken by the passive qualities the 
<A NAME="247"></A>moist and the dry. The elements of bodies, that is, the passive ones, are 
<A NAME="248"></A>the moist and the dry; the bodies themselves are compounded of them and 
<A NAME="249"></A>whichever predominates determines the nature of the body; thus some bodies 
<A NAME="250"></A>partake more of the dry, others of the moist. All the forms to be described 
<A NAME="251"></A>will exist either actually, or potentially and in their opposite: for instance, 
<A NAME="252"></A>there is actual melting and on the other hand that which admits of being 
<A NAME="253"></A>melted.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>Since the moist is easily determined and the dry determined with 
<A NAME="255"></A>difficulty, their relation to one another is like that of a dish and its 
<A NAME="256"></A>condiments. The moist is what makes the dry determinable, and each serves 
<A NAME="257"></A>as a sort of glue to the other-as Empedocles said in his poem on Nature, 
<A NAME="258"></A>'glueing meal together by means of water.' Thus the determined body involves 
<A NAME="259"></A>them both. Of the elements earth is especially representative of the dry, 
<A NAME="260"></A>water of the moist, and therefore all determinate bodies in our world involve 
<A NAME="261"></A>earth and water. Every body shows the quality of that element which predominates 
<A NAME="262"></A>in it. It is because earth and water are the material elements of all bodies 
<A NAME="263"></A>that animals live in them alone and not in air or fire.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>Of the qualities of bodies hardness and softness are those which 
<A NAME="265"></A>must primarily belong to a determined thing, for anything made up of the 
<A NAME="266"></A>dry and the moist is necessarily either hard or soft. Hard is that the 
<A NAME="267"></A>surface of which does not yield into itself; soft that which does yield 
<A NAME="268"></A>but not by interchange of place: water, for instance, is not soft, for 
<A NAME="269"></A>its surface does not yield to pressure or sink in but there is an interchange 
<A NAME="270"></A>of place. Those things are absolutely hard and soft which satisfy the definition 
<A NAME="271"></A>absolutely, and those things relatively so which do so compared with another 
<A NAME="272"></A>thing. Now relatively to one another hard and soft are indefinable, because 
<A NAME="273"></A>it is a matter of degree, but since all the objects of sense are determined 
<A NAME="274"></A>by reference to the faculty of sense it is clearly the relation to touch 
<A NAME="275"></A>which determines that which is hard and soft absolutely, and touch is that 
<A NAME="276"></A>which we use as a standard or mean. So we call that which exceeds it hard 
<A NAME="277"></A>and that which falls short of it soft.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="278"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>A body determined by its own boundary must be either hard or soft; 
<A NAME="280"></A>for it either yields or does not.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>It must also be concrete: or it could not be so determined. So 
<A NAME="282"></A>since everything that is determined and solid is either hard or soft and 
<A NAME="283"></A>these qualities are due to concretion, all composite and determined bodies 
<A NAME="284"></A>must involve concretion. Concretion therefore must be 
<A NAME="285"></A>discussed.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>Now there are two causes besides matter, the agent and the quality 
<A NAME="287"></A>brought about, the agent being the efficient cause, the quality the formal 
<A NAME="288"></A>cause. Hence concretion and disaggregation, drying and moistening, must 
<A NAME="289"></A>have these two causes.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>But since concretion is a form of drying let us speak of the latter 
<A NAME="291"></A>first.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>As we have explained, the agent operates by means of two qualities 
<A NAME="293"></A>and the patient is acted on in virtue of two qualities: action takes place 
<A NAME="294"></A>by means of heat or cold, and the quality is produced either by the presence 
<A NAME="295"></A>or by the absence of heat or cold; but that which is acted upon is moist 
<A NAME="296"></A>or dry or a compound of both. Water is the element characterized by the 
<A NAME="297"></A>moist, earth that characterized by the dry, for these among the elements 
<A NAME="298"></A>that admit the qualities moist and dry are passive. Therefore cold, too, 
<A NAME="299"></A>being found in water and earth (both of which we recognize to be cold), 
<A NAME="300"></A>must be reckoned rather as a passive quality. It is active only as contributing 
<A NAME="301"></A>to destruction or incidentally in the manner described before; for cold 
<A NAME="302"></A>is sometimes actually said to burn and to warm, but not in the same way 
<A NAME="303"></A>as heat does, but by collecting and concentrating heat.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>The subjects of drying are water and the various watery fluids 
<A NAME="305"></A>and those bodies which contain water either foreign or connatural. By foreign 
<A NAME="306"></A>I mean like the water in wool, by connatural, like that in milk. The watery 
<A NAME="307"></A>fluids are wine, urine, whey, and in general those fluids which have no 
<A NAME="308"></A>sediment or only a little, except where this absence of sediment is due 
<A NAME="309"></A>to viscosity. For in some cases, in oil and pitch for instance, it is the 
<A NAME="310"></A>viscosity which prevents any sediment from appearing.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>It is always a process of heating or cooling that dries things, 
<A NAME="312"></A>but the agent in both cases is heat, either internal or external. For even 
<A NAME="313"></A>when things are dried by cooling, like a garment, where the moisture exists 
<A NAME="314"></A>separately it is the internal heat that dries them. It carries off the 
<A NAME="315"></A>moisture in the shape of vapour (if there is not too much of it), being 
<A NAME="316"></A>itself driven out by the surrounding cold. So everything is dried, as we 
<A NAME="317"></A>have said, by a process either of heating or cooling, but the agent is 
<A NAME="318"></A>always heat, either internal or external, carrying off the moisture in 
<A NAME="319"></A>vapour. By external heat I mean as where things are boiled: by internal 
<A NAME="320"></A>where the heat breathes out and takes away and uses up its moisture. So 
<A NAME="321"></A>much for drying.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="322"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>Liquefaction is, first, condensation into water; second, the melting 
<A NAME="324"></A>of a solidified body. The first, condensation, is due to the cooling of 
<A NAME="325"></A>vapour: what melting is will appear from the account of 
<A NAME="326"></A>solidification.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>Whatever solidifies is either water or a mixture of earth and water, 
<A NAME="328"></A>and the agent is either dry heat or cold. Hence those of the bodies solidified 
<A NAME="329"></A>by heat or cold which are soluble at all are dissolved by their opposites. 
<A NAME="330"></A>Bodies solidified by the dry-hot are dissolved by water, which is the moist-cold, 
<A NAME="331"></A>while bodies solidified by cold are dissolved by fire, which is hot. Some 
<A NAME="332"></A>things seem to be solidified by water, e.g. boiled honey, but really it 
<A NAME="333"></A>is not the water but the cold in the water which effects the solidification. 
<A NAME="334"></A>Aqueous bodies are not solidified by fire: for it is fire that dissolves 
<A NAME="335"></A>them, and the same cause in the same relation cannot have opposite effects 
<A NAME="336"></A>upon the same thing. Again, water solidifies owing to the departure of 
<A NAME="337"></A>heat; so it will clearly be dissolved by the entry into it of heat: cold, 
<A NAME="338"></A>therefore, must be the agent in solidifying it.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>Hence aqueous bodies do not thicken when they solidify; for thickening 
<A NAME="340"></A>occurs when the moisture goes off and the dry matter comes together, but 
<A NAME="341"></A>water is the only liquid that does not thicken. Those bodies that are made 
<A NAME="342"></A>up of both earth and water are solidified both by fire and by cold and 
<A NAME="343"></A>in either case are thickened. The operation of the two is in a way the 
<A NAME="344"></A>same and in a way different. Heat acts by drawing off the moisture, and 
<A NAME="345"></A>as the moisture goes off in vapour the dry matter thickens and collects. 
<A NAME="346"></A>Cold acts by driving out the heat, which is accompanied by the moisture 
<A NAME="347"></A>as this goes off in vapour with it. Bodies that are soft but not liquid 
<A NAME="348"></A>do not thicken but solidify when the moisture leaves them, e.g. potter's 
<A NAME="349"></A>clay in process of baking: but those mixed bodies that are liquid thicken 
<A NAME="350"></A>besides solidifying, like milk. Those bodies which have first been thickened 
<A NAME="351"></A>or hardened by cold often begin by becoming moist: thus potter's clay at 
<A NAME="352"></A>first in the process of baking steams and grows softer, and is liable to 
<A NAME="353"></A>distortion in the ovens for that reason.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>Now of the bodies solidified by cold which are made up both of 
<A NAME="355"></A>earth and water but in which the earth preponderates, those which solidify 
<A NAME="356"></A>by the departure of heat melt by heat when it enters into them again; this 
<A NAME="357"></A>is the case with frozen mud. But those which solidify by refrigeration, 
<A NAME="358"></A>where all the moisture has gone off in vapour with the heat, like iron 
<A NAME="359"></A>and horn, cannot be dissolved except by excessive heat, but they can be 
<A NAME="360"></A>softened-though manufactured iron does melt, to the point of becoming fluid 
<A NAME="361"></A>and then solidifying again. This is how steel is made. The dross sinks 
<A NAME="362"></A>to the bottom and is purged away: when this has been done often and the 
<A NAME="363"></A>metal is pure we have steel. The process is not repeated often because 
<A NAME="364"></A>the purification of the metal involves great waste and loss of weight. 
<A NAME="365"></A>But the iron that has less dross is the better iron. The stone pyrimachus, 
<A NAME="366"></A>too, melts and forms into drops and becomes fluid; after having been in 
<A NAME="367"></A>a fluid state it solidifies and becomes hard again. Millstones, too, melt 
<A NAME="368"></A>and become fluid: when the fluid mass begins to solidify it is black but 
<A NAME="369"></A>its consistency comes to be like that of lime. and earth, 
<A NAME="370"></A>too
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>Of the bodies which are solidified by dry heat some are insoluble, 
<A NAME="372"></A>others are dissolved by liquid. Pottery and some kinds of stone that are 
<A NAME="373"></A>formed out of earth burnt up by fire, such as millstones, cannot be dissolved. 
<A NAME="374"></A>Natron and salt are soluble by liquid, but not all liquid but only such 
<A NAME="375"></A>as is cold. Hence water and any of its varieties melt them, but oil does 
<A NAME="376"></A>not. For the opposite of the dry-hot is the cold-moist and what the one 
<A NAME="377"></A>solidified the other will dissolve, and so opposites will have opposite 
<A NAME="378"></A>effects.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="379"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>If a body contains more water than earth fire only thickens it: 
<A NAME="381"></A>if it contains more earth fire solidifies it. Hence natron and salt and 
<A NAME="382"></A>stone and potter's clay must contain more earth.
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>The nature of oil presents the greatest problem. If water preponderated 
<A NAME="384"></A>in it, cold ought to solidify it; if earth preponderated, then fire ought 
<A NAME="385"></A>to do so. Actually neither solidifies, but both thicken it. The reason 
<A NAME="386"></A>is that it is full of air (hence it floats on the top of water, since air 
<A NAME="387"></A>tends to rise). Cold thickens it by turning the air in it into water, for 
<A NAME="388"></A>any mixture of oil and water is thicker than either. Fire and the lapse 
<A NAME="389"></A>of time thicken and whiten it. The whitening follows on the evaporation 
<A NAME="390"></A>of any water that may have been in it; the is due to the change of the 
<A NAME="391"></A>air into water as the heat in the oil is dissipated. The effect in both 
<A NAME="392"></A>cases is the same and the cause is the same, but the manner of its operation 
<A NAME="393"></A>is different. Both heat and cold thicken it, but neither dries it (neither 
<A NAME="394"></A>the sun nor cold dries oil), not only because it is glutinous but because 
<A NAME="395"></A>it contains air. Its glutinous nature prevents it from giving off vapour 
<A NAME="396"></A>and so fire does not dry it or boil it off.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>Those bodies which are made up of earth and water may be classified 
<A NAME="398"></A>according to the preponderance of either. There is a kind of wine, for 
<A NAME="399"></A>instance, which both solidifies and thickens by boiling-I mean, must. All 
<A NAME="400"></A>bodies of this kind lose their water as they That it is their water may 
<A NAME="401"></A>be seen from the fact that the vapour from them condenses into water when 
<A NAME="402"></A>collected. So wherever some sediment is left this is of the nature of earth. 
<A NAME="403"></A>Some of these bodies, as we have said, are also thickened and dried by 
<A NAME="404"></A>cold. For cold not only solidifies but also dries water, and thickens things 
<A NAME="405"></A>by turning air into water. (Solidifying, as we have said, is a form of 
<A NAME="406"></A>drying.) Now those things that are not thickened by cold, but solidified, 
<A NAME="407"></A>belong rather to water, e.g.. wine, urine, vinegar, lye, whey. But those 
<A NAME="408"></A>things that are thickened (not by evaporation due to fire) are made up 
<A NAME="409"></A>either of earth or of water and air: honey of earth, while oil contains 
<A NAME="410"></A>air. Milk and blood, too, are made up of both water and earth, though earth 
<A NAME="411"></A>generally predominates in them. So, too, are the liquids out of which natron 
<A NAME="412"></A>and salt are formed; and stones are also formed from some mixtures of this 
<A NAME="413"></A>kind. Hence, if the whey has not been separated, it burns away if you boil 
<A NAME="414"></A>it over a fire. But the earthy element in milk can also be coagulated by 
<A NAME="415"></A>the help of fig-juice, if you boil it in a certain way as doctors do when 
<A NAME="416"></A>they treat it with fig-juice, and this is how the whey and the cheese are 
<A NAME="417"></A>commonly separated. Whey, once separated, does not thicken, as the milk 
<A NAME="418"></A>did, but boils away like water. Sometimes, however, there is little or 
<A NAME="419"></A>no cheese in milk, and such milk is not nutritive and is more like water. 
<A NAME="420"></A>The case of blood is similar: cold dries and so solidifies it. Those kinds 
<A NAME="421"></A>of blood that do not solidify, like that of the stag, belong rather to 
<A NAME="422"></A>water and are very cold. Hence they contain no fibres: for the fibres are 
<A NAME="423"></A>of earth and solid, and blood from which they have been removed does not 
<A NAME="424"></A>solidify. This is because it cannot dry; for what remains is water, just 
<A NAME="425"></A>as what remains of milk when cheese has been removed is water. The fact 
<A NAME="426"></A>that diseased blood will not solidify is evidence of the same thing, for 
<A NAME="427"></A>such blood is of the nature of serum and that is phlegm and water, the 
<A NAME="428"></A>nature of the animal having failed to get the better of it and digest 
<A NAME="429"></A>it.
<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR>Some of these bodies are soluble, e.g. natron, some insoluble, 
<A NAME="431"></A>e.g. pottery: of the latter, some, like horn, can be softened by heat, 
<A NAME="432"></A>others, like pottery and stone, cannot. The reason is that opposite causes 
<A NAME="433"></A>have opposite effects: consequently, if solidification is due to two causes, 
<A NAME="434"></A>the cold and the dry, solution must be due to the hot and the moist, that 
<A NAME="435"></A>is, to fire and to water (these being opposites): water dissolving what 
<A NAME="436"></A>was solidified by fire alone, fire what was solidified by cold alone. Consequently, 
<A NAME="437"></A>if any things happen to be solidified by the action of both, these are 
<A NAME="438"></A>least apt to be soluble. Such a case we find where things have been heated 
<A NAME="439"></A>and are then solidified by cold. When the heat in leaving them has caused 
<A NAME="440"></A>most of the moisture to evaporate, the cold so compacts these bodies together 
<A NAME="441"></A>again as to leave no entrance even for moisture. Therefore heat does not 
<A NAME="442"></A>dissolve them (for it only dissolves those bodies that are solidified by 
<A NAME="443"></A>cold alone), nor does water (for it does not dissolve what cold solidifies, 
<A NAME="444"></A>but only what is solidified by dry heat). But iron is melted by heat and 
<A NAME="445"></A>solidified by cold. Wood consists of earth and air and is therefore combustible 
<A NAME="446"></A>but cannot be melted or softened by heat. (For the same reason it floats 
<A NAME="447"></A>in water-all except ebony. This does not, for other kinds of wood contain 
<A NAME="448"></A>a preponderance of air, but in black ebony the air has escaped and so earth 
<A NAME="449"></A>preponderates in it.) Pottery consists of earth alone because it solidified 
<A NAME="450"></A>gradually in the process of drying. Water cannot get into it, for the pores 
<A NAME="451"></A>were only large enough to admit of vapour escaping: and seeing that fire 
<A NAME="452"></A>solidified it, that cannot dissolve it either.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR>So solidification and melting, their causes, and the kinds of subjects 
<A NAME="454"></A>in which they occur have been described.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="455"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>All this makes it clear that bodies are formed by heat and cold 
<A NAME="457"></A>and that these agents operate by thickening and solidifying. It is because 
<A NAME="458"></A>these qualities fashion bodies that we find heat in all of them, and in 
<A NAME="459"></A>some cold in so far as heat is absent. These qualities, then, are present 
<A NAME="460"></A>as active, and the moist and the dry as passive, and consequently all four 
<A NAME="461"></A>are found in mixed bodies. So water and earth are the constituents of homogeneous 
<A NAME="462"></A>bodies both in plants and in animals and of metals such as gold, silver, 
<A NAME="463"></A>and the rest-water and earth and their respective exhalations shut up in 
<A NAME="464"></A>the compound bodies, as we have explained elsewhere.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>All these mixed bodies are distinguished from one another, firstly 
<A NAME="466"></A>by the qualities special to the various senses, that is, by their capacities 
<A NAME="467"></A>of action. (For a thing is white, fragrant, sonant, sweet, hot, cold in 
<A NAME="468"></A>virtue of a power of acting on sense). Secondly by other more characteristic 
<A NAME="469"></A>affections which express their aptitude to be affected: I mean, for instance, 
<A NAME="470"></A>the aptitude to melt or solidify or bend and so forth, all these qualities, 
<A NAME="471"></A>like moist and dry, being passive. These are the qualities that differentiate 
<A NAME="472"></A>bone, flesh, sinew, wood, bark, stone and all other homogeneous natural 
<A NAME="473"></A>bodies. Let us begin by enumerating these qualities expressing the aptitude 
<A NAME="474"></A>or inaptitude of a thing to be affected in a certain way. They are as follows: 
<A NAME="475"></A>to be apt or inapt to solidify, melt, be softened by heat, be softened 
<A NAME="476"></A>by water, bend, break, be comminuted, impressed, moulded, squeezed; to 
<A NAME="477"></A>be tractile or non-tractile, malleable or non-malleable, to be fissile 
<A NAME="478"></A>or non-fissile, apt or inapt to be cut; to be viscous or friable, compressible 
<A NAME="479"></A>or incompressible, combustible or incombustible; to be apt or inapt to 
<A NAME="480"></A>give off fumes. These affections differentiate most bodies from one another. 
<A NAME="481"></A>Let us go on to explain the nature of each of them. We have already given 
<A NAME="482"></A>a general account of that which is apt or inapt to solidify or to melt, 
<A NAME="483"></A>but let us return to them again now. Of all the bodies that admit of solidification 
<A NAME="484"></A>and hardening, some are brought into this state by heat, others by cold. 
<A NAME="485"></A>Heat does this by drying up their moisture, cold by driving out their heat. 
<A NAME="486"></A>Consequently some bodies are affected in this way by defect of moisture, 
<A NAME="487"></A>some by defect of heat: watery bodies by defect of heat, earthy bodies 
<A NAME="488"></A>of moisture. Now those bodies that are so affected by defect of moisture 
<A NAME="489"></A>are dissolved by water, unless like pottery they have so contracted that 
<A NAME="490"></A>their pores are too small for the particles of water to enter. All those 
<A NAME="491"></A>bodies in which this is not the case are dissolved by water, e.g. natron, 
<A NAME="492"></A>salt, dry mud. Those bodies that solidified through defect of heat are 
<A NAME="493"></A>melted by heat, e.g. ice, lead, copper. So much for the bodies that admit 
<A NAME="494"></A>of solidification and of melting, and those that do not admit of 
<A NAME="495"></A>melting.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>The bodies which do not admit of solidification are those which 
<A NAME="497"></A>contain no aqueous moisture and are not watery, but in which heat and earth 
<A NAME="498"></A>preponderate, like honey and must (for these are in a sort of state of 
<A NAME="499"></A>effervescence), and those which do possess some water but have a preponderance 
<A NAME="500"></A>of air, like oil and quicksilver, and all viscous substances such as pitch 
<A NAME="501"></A>and birdlime.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="502"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR>Those bodies admit of softening which are not (like ice) made up 
<A NAME="504"></A>of water, but in which earth predominates. All their moisture must not 
<A NAME="505"></A>have left them (as in the case of natron and salt), nor must the relation 
<A NAME="506"></A>of dry to moist in them be incongruous (as in the case of pottery). They 
<A NAME="507"></A>must be tractile (without admitting water) or malleable (without consisting 
<A NAME="508"></A>of water), and the agent in softening them is fire. Such are iron and 
<A NAME="509"></A>horn.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>Both of bodies that can melt and of bodies that cannot, some do 
<A NAME="511"></A>and some do not admit of softening in water. Copper, for instance, which 
<A NAME="512"></A>can be melted, cannot be softened in water, whereas wool and earth can 
<A NAME="513"></A>be softened in water, for they can be soaked. (It is true that though copper 
<A NAME="514"></A>can be melted the agent in its case is not water, but some of the bodies 
<A NAME="515"></A>that can be melted by water too such as natron and salt cannot be softened 
<A NAME="516"></A>in water: for nothing is said to be so affected unless the water soaks 
<A NAME="517"></A>into it and makes it softer.) Some things, on the other hand, such as wool 
<A NAME="518"></A>and grain, can be softened by water though they cannot be melted. Any body 
<A NAME="519"></A>that is to be softened by water must be of earth and must have its pores 
<A NAME="520"></A>larger than the particles of water, and the pores themselves must be able 
<A NAME="521"></A>to resist the action of water, whereas bodies that can be 'melted' by water 
<A NAME="522"></A>must have pores throughout.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>(Why is it that earth is both 'melted' and softened by moisture, 
<A NAME="524"></A>while natron is 'melted' but not softened? Because natron is pervaded throughout 
<A NAME="525"></A>by pores so that the parts are immediately divided by the water, but earth 
<A NAME="526"></A>has also pores which do not connect and is therefore differently affected 
<A NAME="527"></A>according as the water enters by one or the other set of 
<A NAME="528"></A>pores.)
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>Some bodies can be bent or straightened, like the reed or the withy, 
<A NAME="530"></A>some cannot, like pottery and stone. Those bodies are apt to be bent and 
<A NAME="531"></A>straightened which can change from being curved to being straight and from 
<A NAME="532"></A>being straight to being curved, and bending and straightening consist in 
<A NAME="533"></A>the change or motion to the straight or to a curve, for a thing is said 
<A NAME="534"></A>to be in process of being bent whether it is being made to assume a convex 
<A NAME="535"></A>or a concave shape. So bending is defined as motion to the convex or the 
<A NAME="536"></A>concave without a change of length. For if we added 'or to the straight', 
<A NAME="537"></A>we should have a thing bent and straight at once, and it is impossible 
<A NAME="538"></A>for that which is straight to be bent. And if all bending is a bending 
<A NAME="539"></A>back or a bending down, the former being a change to the convex, the latter 
<A NAME="540"></A>to the concave, a motion that leads to the straight cannot be called bending, 
<A NAME="541"></A>but bending and straightening are two different things. These, then, are 
<A NAME="542"></A>the things that can, and those that cannot be bent, and be 
<A NAME="543"></A>straightened.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR>Some things can be both broken and comminuted, others admit only 
<A NAME="545"></A>one or the other. Wood, for instance, can be broken but not comminuted, 
<A NAME="546"></A>ice and stone can be comminuted but not broken, while pottery may either 
<A NAME="547"></A>be comminuted or broken. The distinction is this: breaking is a division 
<A NAME="548"></A>and separation into large parts, comminution into parts of any size, but 
<A NAME="549"></A>there must be more of them than two. Now those solids that have many pores 
<A NAME="550"></A>not communicating with one another are comminuible (for the limit to their 
<A NAME="551"></A>subdivision is set by the pores), but those whose pores stretch continuously 
<A NAME="552"></A>for a long way are breakable, while those which have pores of both kinds 
<A NAME="553"></A>are both comminuible and breakable.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>Some things, e.g. copper and wax, are impressible, others, e.g. 
<A NAME="555"></A>pottery and water, are not. The process of being impressed is the sinking 
<A NAME="556"></A>of a part of the surface of a thing in response to pressure or a blow, 
<A NAME="557"></A>in general to contact. Such bodies are either soft, like wax, where part 
<A NAME="558"></A>of the surface is depressed while the rest remains, or hard, like copper. 
<A NAME="559"></A>Non-impressible bodies are either hard, like pottery (its surface does 
<A NAME="560"></A>not give way and sink in), or liquid, like water (for though water does 
<A NAME="561"></A>give way it is not in a part of it, for there is a reciprocal change of 
<A NAME="562"></A>place of all its parts). Those impressibles that retain the shape impressed 
<A NAME="563"></A>on them and are easily moulded by the hand are called 'plastic'; those 
<A NAME="564"></A>that are not easily moulded, such as stone or wood, or are easily moulded 
<A NAME="565"></A>but do not retain the shape impressed, like wool or a sponge, are not plastic. 
<A NAME="566"></A>The last group are said to be 'squeezable'. Things are 'squeezable' when 
<A NAME="567"></A>they can contract into themselves under pressure, their surface sinking 
<A NAME="568"></A>in without being broken and without the parts interchanging position as 
<A NAME="569"></A>happens in the case of water. (We speak of pressure when there is movement 
<A NAME="570"></A>and the motor remains in contact with the thing moved, of impact when the 
<A NAME="571"></A>movement is due to the local movement of the motor.) Those bodies are subject 
<A NAME="572"></A>to squeezing which have empty pores-empty, that is, of the stuff of which 
<A NAME="573"></A>the body itself consists-and that can sink upon the void spaces within 
<A NAME="574"></A>them, or rather upon their pores. For sometimes the pores upon which a 
<A NAME="575"></A>body sinks in are not empty (a wet sponge, for instance, has its pores 
<A NAME="576"></A>full). But the pores, if full, must be full of something softer than the 
<A NAME="577"></A>body itself which is to contract. Examples of things squeezable are the 
<A NAME="578"></A>sponge, wax, flesh. Those things are not squeezable which cannot be made 
<A NAME="579"></A>to contract upon their own pores by pressure, either because they have 
<A NAME="580"></A>no pores or because their pores are full of something too hard. Thus iron, 
<A NAME="581"></A>stone, water and all liquids are incapable of being 
<A NAME="582"></A>squeezed.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR>Things are tractile when their surface can be made to elongate, 
<A NAME="584"></A>for being drawn out is a movement of the surface, remaining unbroken, in 
<A NAME="585"></A>the direction of the mover. Some things are tractile, e.g. hair, thongs, 
<A NAME="586"></A>sinew, dough, birdlime, and some are not, e.g. water, stone. Some things 
<A NAME="587"></A>are both tractile and squeezable, e.g. wool; in other cases the two qualities 
<A NAME="588"></A>do not coincide; phlegm, for instance, is tractile but not squeezable, 
<A NAME="589"></A>and a sponge squeezable but not tractile.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>Some things are malleable, like copper. Some are not, like stone 
<A NAME="591"></A>and wood. Things are malleable when their surface can be made to move (but 
<A NAME="592"></A>only in part) both downwards and sideways with one and the same blow: when 
<A NAME="593"></A>this is not possible a body is not malleable. All malleable bodies are 
<A NAME="594"></A>impressible, but not all impressible bodies are malleable, e.g. wood, though 
<A NAME="595"></A>on the whole the two go together. Of squeezable things some are malleable 
<A NAME="596"></A>and some not: wax and mud are malleable, wool is not. Some things are fissile, 
<A NAME="597"></A>e.g. wood, some are not, e.g. potter's clay. A thing is fissile when it 
<A NAME="598"></A>is apt to divide in advance of the instrument dividing it, for a body is 
<A NAME="599"></A>said to split when it divides to a further point than that to which the 
<A NAME="600"></A>dividing instrument divides it and the act of division advances: which 
<A NAME="601"></A>is not the case with cutting. Those bodies which cannot behave like this 
<A NAME="602"></A>are non-fissile. Nothing soft is fissile (by soft I mean absolutely soft 
<A NAME="603"></A>and not relatively: for iron itself may be relatively soft); nor are all 
<A NAME="604"></A>hard things fissile, but only such as are neither liquid nor impressible 
<A NAME="605"></A>nor comminuible. Such are the bodies that have the pores along which they 
<A NAME="606"></A>cohere lengthwise and not crosswise.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>Those hard or soft solids are apt to be cut which do not necessarily 
<A NAME="608"></A>either split in advance of the instrument or break into minute fragments 
<A NAME="609"></A>when they are being divided. Those that necessarily do so and liquids cannot 
<A NAME="610"></A>be cut. Some things can be both split and cut, like wood, though generally 
<A NAME="611"></A>it is lengthwise that a thing can be split and crosswise that it can be 
<A NAME="612"></A>cut. For, a body being divided into many parts fin so far as its unity 
<A NAME="613"></A>is made up of many lengths it is apt to be split, in so far as it is made 
<A NAME="614"></A>up of many breadths it is apt to be cut.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>A thing is viscous when, being moist or soft, it is tractile. Bodies 
<A NAME="616"></A>owe this property to the interlocking of their parts when they are composed 
<A NAME="617"></A>like chains, for then they can be drawn out to a great length and contracted 
<A NAME="618"></A>again. Bodies that are not like this are friable. Bodies are compressible 
<A NAME="619"></A>when they are squeezable and retain the shape they have been squeezed into; 
<A NAME="620"></A>incompressible when they are either inapt to be squeezed at all or do not 
<A NAME="621"></A>retain the shape they have been squeezed into.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>Some bodies are combustible and some are not. Wood, wool, bone 
<A NAME="623"></A>are combustible; stone, ice are not. Bodies are combustible when their 
<A NAME="624"></A>pores are such as to admit fire and their longitudinal pores contain moisture 
<A NAME="625"></A>weaker than fire. If they have no moisture, or if, as in ice or very green 
<A NAME="626"></A>wood, the moisture is stronger than fire, they are not 
<A NAME="627"></A>combustible.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR><BR>Those bodies give off fumes which contain moisture, but in such 
<A NAME="629"></A>a form that it does not go off separately in vapour when they are exposed 
<A NAME="630"></A>to fire. For vapour is a moist secretion tending to the nature of air produced 
<A NAME="631"></A>from a liquid by the agency of burning heat. Bodies that give off fumes 
<A NAME="632"></A>give off secretions of the nature of air by the lapse of time: as they 
<A NAME="633"></A>perish away they dry up or become earth. But the kind of secretion we are 
<A NAME="634"></A>concerned with now differs from others in that it is not moist nor does 
<A NAME="635"></A>it become wind (which is a continuous flow of air in a given direction). 
<A NAME="636"></A>Fumes are common secretion of dry and moist together caused by the agency 
<A NAME="637"></A>of burning heat. Hence they do not moisten things but rather colour 
<A NAME="638"></A>them.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>The fumes of a woody body are called smoke. (I mean to include 
<A NAME="640"></A>bones and hair and everything of this kind in the same class. For there 
<A NAME="641"></A>is no name common to all the objects that I mean, but, for all that, these 
<A NAME="642"></A>things are all in the same class by analogy. Compare what Empedocles says: 
<A NAME="643"></A>They are one and the same, hair and leaves and the thick wings of birds 
<A NAME="644"></A>and scales that grow on stout limbs.) The fumes of fat are a sooty smoke 
<A NAME="645"></A>and those of oily substances a greasy steam. Oil does not boil away or 
<A NAME="646"></A>thicken by evaporation because it does not give off vapour but fumes. Water 
<A NAME="647"></A>on the other hand does not give off fumes, but vapour. Sweet wine does 
<A NAME="648"></A>give off fumes, for it contains fat and behaves like oil. It does not solidify 
<A NAME="649"></A>under the influence of cold and it is apt to burn. Really it is not wine 
<A NAME="650"></A>at all in spite of its name: for it does not taste like wine and consequently 
<A NAME="651"></A>does not inebriate as ordinary wine does. It contains but little fumigable 
<A NAME="652"></A>stuff and consequently is inflammable.
<A NAME="653"></A><BR><BR>All bodies are combustible that dissolve into ashes, and all bodies 
<A NAME="654"></A>do this that solidify under the influence either of heat or of both heat 
<A NAME="655"></A>and cold; for we find that all these bodies are mastered by fire. Of stones 
<A NAME="656"></A>the precious stone called carbuncle is least amenable to 
<A NAME="657"></A>fire.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>Of combustible bodies some are inflammable and some are not, and 
<A NAME="659"></A>some of the former are reduced to coals. Those are called 'inflammable' 
<A NAME="660"></A>which produce flame and those which do not are called 'non-inflammable'. 
<A NAME="661"></A>Those fumigable bodies that are not liquid are inflammable, but pitch, 
<A NAME="662"></A>oil, wax are inflammable in conjunction with other bodies rather than by 
<A NAME="663"></A>themselves. Most inflammable are those bodies that give off smoke. Of bodies 
<A NAME="664"></A>of this kind those that contain more earth than smoke are apt to be reduced 
<A NAME="665"></A>to coals. Some bodies that can be melted are not inflammable, e.g. copper; 
<A NAME="666"></A>and some bodies that cannot be melted are inflammable, e.g. wood; and some 
<A NAME="667"></A>bodies can be melted and are also inflammable, e.g. frankincense. The reason 
<A NAME="668"></A>is that wood has its moisture all together and this is continuous throughout 
<A NAME="669"></A>and so it burns up: whereas copper has it in each part but not continuous, 
<A NAME="670"></A>and insufficient in quantity to give rise to flame. In frankincense it 
<A NAME="671"></A>is disposed in both of these ways. Fumigable bodies are inflammable when 
<A NAME="672"></A>earth predominates in them and they are consequently such as to be unable 
<A NAME="673"></A>to melt. These are inflammable because they are dry like fire. When this 
<A NAME="674"></A>dry comes to be hot there is fire. This is why flame is burning smoke or 
<A NAME="675"></A>dry exhalation. The fumes of wood are smoke, those of wax and frankincense 
<A NAME="676"></A>and such-like, and pitch and whatever contains pitch or such-like are sooty 
<A NAME="677"></A>smoke, while the fumes of oil and oily substances are a greasy steam; so 
<A NAME="678"></A>are those of all substances which are not at all combustible by themselves 
<A NAME="679"></A>because there is too little of the dry in them (the dry being the means 
<A NAME="680"></A>by which the transition to fire is effected), but burn very readily in 
<A NAME="681"></A>conjunction with something else. (For the fat is just the conjunction of 
<A NAME="682"></A>the oily with the dry.) So those bodies that give off fumes, like oil and 
<A NAME="683"></A>pitch, belong rather to the moist, but those that burn to the 
<A NAME="684"></A>dry.

<A NAME="685"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR>Homogeneous bodies differ to touch-by these affections and differences, 
<A NAME="687"></A>as we have said. They also differ in respect of their smell, taste, and 
<A NAME="688"></A>colour.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR><BR>By homogeneous bodies I mean, for instance, 'metals', gold, copper, 
<A NAME="690"></A>silver, tin, iron, stone, and everything else of this kind and the bodies 
<A NAME="691"></A>that are extracted from them; also the substances found in animals and 
<A NAME="692"></A>plants, for instance, flesh, bones, sinew, skin, viscera, hair, fibres, 
<A NAME="693"></A>veins (these are the elements of which the non-homogeneous bodies like 
<A NAME="694"></A>the face, a hand, a foot, and everything of that kind are made up), and 
<A NAME="695"></A>in plants, wood, bark, leaves, roots, and the rest like 
<A NAME="696"></A>them.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR>The homogeneous bodies, it is true, are constituted by a different 
<A NAME="698"></A>cause, but the matter of which they are composed is the dry and the moist, 
<A NAME="699"></A>that is, water and earth (for these bodies exhibit those qualities most 
<A NAME="700"></A>clearly). The agents are the hot and the cold, for they constitute and 
<A NAME="701"></A>make concrete the homogeneous bodies out of earth and water as matter. 
<A NAME="702"></A>Let us consider, then, which of the homogeneous bodies are made of earth 
<A NAME="703"></A>and which of water, and which of both.
<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR>Of organized bodies some are liquid, some soft, some hard. The 
<A NAME="705"></A>soft and the hard are constituted by a process of solidification, as we 
<A NAME="706"></A>have already explained.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR>Those liquids that go off in vapour are made of water, those that 
<A NAME="708"></A>do not are either of the nature of earth, or a mixture either of earth 
<A NAME="709"></A>and water, like milk, or of earth and air, like wood, or of water and air, 
<A NAME="710"></A>like oil. Those liquids which are thickened by heat are a mixture. (Wine 
<A NAME="711"></A>is a liquid which raises a difficulty: for it is both liable to evaporation 
<A NAME="712"></A>and it also thickens; for instance new wine does. The reason is that the 
<A NAME="713"></A>word 'wine' is ambiguous and different 'wines' behave in different ways. 
<A NAME="714"></A>New wine is more earthy than old, and for this reason it is more apt to 
<A NAME="715"></A>be thickened by heat and less apt to be congealed by cold. For it contains 
<A NAME="716"></A>much heat and a great proportion of earth, as in Arcadia, where it is so 
<A NAME="717"></A>dried up in its skins by the smoke that you scrape it to drink. If all 
<A NAME="718"></A>wine has some sediment in it then it will belong to earth or to water according 
<A NAME="719"></A>to the quantity of the sediment it possesses.) The liquids that are thickened 
<A NAME="720"></A>by cold are of the nature of earth; those that are thickened either by 
<A NAME="721"></A>heat or by cold consist of more than one element, like oil and honey, and 
<A NAME="722"></A>'sweet wine'.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>Of solid bodies those that have been solidified by cold are of 
<A NAME="724"></A>water, e.g. ice, snow, hail, hoar-frost. Those solidified by heat are of 
<A NAME="725"></A>earth, e.g. pottery, cheese, natron, salt. Some bodies are solidified by 
<A NAME="726"></A>both heat and cold. Of this kind are those solidified by refrigeration, 
<A NAME="727"></A>that is by the privation both of heat and of the moisture which departs 
<A NAME="728"></A>with the heat. For salt and the bodies that are purely of earth solidify 
<A NAME="729"></A>by the privation of moisture only, ice by that of heat only, these bodies 
<A NAME="730"></A>by that of both. So both the active qualities and both kinds of matter 
<A NAME="731"></A>were involved in the process. Of these bodies those from which all the 
<A NAME="732"></A>moisture has gone are all of them of earth, like pottery or amber. (For 
<A NAME="733"></A>amber, also, and the bodies called 'tears' are formed by refrigeration, 
<A NAME="734"></A>like myrrh, frankincense, gum. Amber, too, appears to belong to this class 
<A NAME="735"></A>of things: the animals enclosed in it show that it is formed by solidification. 
<A NAME="736"></A>The heat is driven out of it by the cold of the river and causes the moisture 
<A NAME="737"></A>to evaporate with it, as in the case of honey when it has been heated and 
<A NAME="738"></A>is immersed in water.) Some of these bodies cannot be melted or softened; 
<A NAME="739"></A>for instance, amber and certain stones, e.g. the stalactites in caves. 
<A NAME="740"></A>(For these stalactites, too, are formed in the same way: the agent is not 
<A NAME="741"></A>fire, but cold which drives out the heat, which, as it leaves the body, 
<A NAME="742"></A>draws out the moisture with it: in the other class of bodies the agent 
<A NAME="743"></A>is external fire.) In those from which the moisture has not wholly gone 
<A NAME="744"></A>earth still preponderates, but they admit of softening by heat, e.g. iron 
<A NAME="745"></A>and horn.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR><BR>Now since we must include among 'meltables' those bodies which 
<A NAME="747"></A>are melted by fire, these contain some water: indeed some of them, like 
<A NAME="748"></A>wax, are common to earth and water alike. But those that are melted by 
<A NAME="749"></A>water are of earth. Those that are not melted either by fire or water are 
<A NAME="750"></A>of earth, or of earth and water.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR>Since, then, all bodies are either liquid or solid, and since the 
<A NAME="752"></A>things that display the affections we have enumerated belong to these two 
<A NAME="753"></A>classes and there is nothing intermediate, it follows that we have given 
<A NAME="754"></A>a complete account of the criteria for distinguishing whether a body consists 
<A NAME="755"></A>of earth or of water or of more elements than one, and whether fire was 
<A NAME="756"></A>the agent in its formation, or cold, or both.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR><BR>Gold, then, and silver and copper and tin and lead and glass and 
<A NAME="758"></A>many nameless stone are of water: for they are all melted by heat. Of water, 
<A NAME="759"></A>too, are some wines and urine and vinegar and lye and whey and serum: for 
<A NAME="760"></A>they are all congealed by cold. In iron, horn, nails, bones, sinews, wood, 
<A NAME="761"></A>hair, leaves, bark, earth preponderates. So, too, in amber, myrrh, frankincense, 
<A NAME="762"></A>and all the substances called 'tears', and stalactites, and fruits, such 
<A NAME="763"></A>as leguminous plants and corn. For things of this kind are, to a greater 
<A NAME="764"></A>or less degree, of earth. For of all these bodies some admit of softening 
<A NAME="765"></A>by heat, the rest give off fumes and are formed by refrigeration. So again 
<A NAME="766"></A>in natron, salt, and those kinds of stones that are not formed by refrigeration 
<A NAME="767"></A>and cannot be melted. Blood, on the other hand, and semen, are made up 
<A NAME="768"></A>of earth and water and air. If the blood contains fibres, earth preponderates 
<A NAME="769"></A>in it: consequently its solidifies by refrigeration and is melted by liquids; 
<A NAME="770"></A>if not, it is of water and therefore does not solidify. Semen solidifies 
<A NAME="771"></A>by refrigeration, its moisture leaving it together with its 
<A NAME="772"></A>heat.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="773"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="774"></A><BR><BR>We must investigate in the light of the results we have arrived 
<A NAME="775"></A>at what solid or liquid bodies are hot and what cold.
<A NAME="776"></A><BR><BR>Bodies consisting of water are commonly cold, unless (like lye, 
<A NAME="777"></A>urine, wine) they contain foreign heat. Bodies consisting of earth, on 
<A NAME="778"></A>the other hand, are commonly hot because heat was active in forming them: 
<A NAME="779"></A>for instance lime and ashes.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR><BR>We must recognize that cold is in a sense the matter of bodies. 
<A NAME="781"></A>For the dry and the moist are matter (being passive) and earth and water 
<A NAME="782"></A>are the elements that primarily embody them, and they are characterized 
<A NAME="783"></A>by cold. Consequently cold must predominate in every body that consists 
<A NAME="784"></A>of one or other of the elements simply, unless such a body contains foreign 
<A NAME="785"></A>heat as water does when it boils or when it has been strained through ashes. 
<A NAME="786"></A>This latter, too, has acquired heat from the ashes, for everything that 
<A NAME="787"></A>has been burnt contains more or less heat. This explains the generation 
<A NAME="788"></A>of animals in putrefying bodies: the putrefying body contains the heat 
<A NAME="789"></A>which destroyed its proper heat.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR><BR>Bodies made up of earth and water are hot, for most of them derive 
<A NAME="791"></A>their existence from concoction and heat, though some, like the waste products 
<A NAME="792"></A>of the body, are products of putrefaction. Thus blood, semen, marrow, figjuice, 
<A NAME="793"></A>and all things of the kinds are hot as long as they are in their natural 
<A NAME="794"></A>state, but when they perish and fall away from that state they are so no 
<A NAME="795"></A>longer. For what is left of them is their matter and that is earth and 
<A NAME="796"></A>water. Hence both views are held about them, some people maintaining them 
<A NAME="797"></A>to be cold and others to be warm; for they are observed to be hot when 
<A NAME="798"></A>they are in their natural state, but to solidify when they have fallen 
<A NAME="799"></A>away from it. That, then, is the case of mixed bodies. However, the distinction 
<A NAME="800"></A>we laid down holds good: if its matter is predominantly water a body is 
<A NAME="801"></A>cold (water being the complete opposite of fire), but if earth or air it 
<A NAME="802"></A>tends to be warm.
<A NAME="803"></A><BR><BR>It sometimes happens that the coldest bodies can be raised to the 
<A NAME="804"></A>highest temperature by foreign heat; for the most solid and the hardest 
<A NAME="805"></A>bodies are coldest when deprived of heat and most burning after exposure 
<A NAME="806"></A>to fire: thus water is more burning than smoke and stone than 
<A NAME="807"></A>water.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="808"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR>Having explained all this we must describe the nature of flesh, 
<A NAME="810"></A>bone, and the other homogeneous bodies severally.
<A NAME="811"></A><BR><BR>Our account of the formation of the homogeneous bodies has given 
<A NAME="812"></A>us the elements out of which they are compounded and the classes into which 
<A NAME="813"></A>they fall, and has made it clear to which class each of those bodies belongs. 
<A NAME="814"></A>The homogeneous bodies are made up of the elements, and all the works of 
<A NAME="815"></A>nature in turn of the homogeneous bodies as matter. All the homogeneous 
<A NAME="816"></A>bodies consist of the elements described, as matter, but their essential 
<A NAME="817"></A>nature is determined by their definition. This fact is always clearer in 
<A NAME="818"></A>the case of the later products of those, in fact, that are instruments, 
<A NAME="819"></A>as it were, and have an end: it is clearer, for instance, that a dead man 
<A NAME="820"></A>is a man only in name. And so the hand of a dead man, too, will in the 
<A NAME="821"></A>same way be a hand in name only, just as stone flutes might still be called 
<A NAME="822"></A>flutes: for these members, too, are instruments of a kind. But in the case 
<A NAME="823"></A>of flesh and bone the fact is not so clear to see, and in that of fire 
<A NAME="824"></A>and water even less. For the end is least obvious there where matter predominates 
<A NAME="825"></A>most. If you take the extremes, matter is pure matter and the essence is 
<A NAME="826"></A>pure definition; but the bodies intermediate between the two are matter 
<A NAME="827"></A>or definition in proportion as they are near to either. For each of those 
<A NAME="828"></A>elements has an end and is not water or fire in any and every condition 
<A NAME="829"></A>of itself, just as flesh is not flesh nor viscera viscera, and the same 
<A NAME="830"></A>is true in a higher degree with face and hand. What a thing is always determined 
<A NAME="831"></A>by its function: a thing really is itself when it can perform its function; 
<A NAME="832"></A>an eye, for instance, when it can see. When a thing cannot do so it is 
<A NAME="833"></A>that thing only in name, like a dead eye or one made of stone, just as 
<A NAME="834"></A>a wooden saw is no more a saw than one in a picture. The same, then, is 
<A NAME="835"></A>true of flesh, except that its function is less clear than that of the 
<A NAME="836"></A>tongue. So, too, with fire; but its function is perhaps even harder to 
<A NAME="837"></A>specify by physical inquiry than that of flesh. The parts of plants, and 
<A NAME="838"></A>inanimate bodies like copper and silver, are in the same case. They all 
<A NAME="839"></A>are what they are in virtue of a certain power of action or passion-just 
<A NAME="840"></A>like flesh and sinew. But we cannot state their form accurately, and so 
<A NAME="841"></A>it is not easy to tell when they are really there and when they are not 
<A NAME="842"></A>unless the body is thoroughly corrupted and its shape only remains. So 
<A NAME="843"></A>ancient corpses suddenly become ashes in the grave and very old fruit preserves 
<A NAME="844"></A>its shape only but not its taste: so, too, with the solids that form from 
<A NAME="845"></A>milk.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR><BR>Now heat and cold and the motions they set up as the bodies are 
<A NAME="847"></A>solidified by the hot and the cold are sufficient to form all such parts 
<A NAME="848"></A>as are the homogeneous bodies, flesh, bone, hair, sinew, and the rest. 
<A NAME="849"></A>For they are all of them differentiated by the various qualities enumerated 
<A NAME="850"></A>above, tension, tractility, comminuibility, hardness, softness, and the 
<A NAME="851"></A>rest of them: all of which are derived from the hot and the cold and the 
<A NAME="852"></A>mixture of their motions. But no one would go as far as to consider them 
<A NAME="853"></A>sufficient in the case of the non-homogeneous parts (like the head, the 
<A NAME="854"></A>hand, or the foot) which these homogeneous parts go to make up. Cold and 
<A NAME="855"></A>heat and their motion would be admitted to account for the formation of 
<A NAME="856"></A>copper or silver, but not for that of a saw, a bowl, or a box. So here, 
<A NAME="857"></A>save that in the examples given the cause is art, but in the nonhomogeneous 
<A NAME="858"></A>bodies nature or some other cause.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR>Since, then, we know to what element each of the homogeneous bodies 
<A NAME="860"></A>belongs, we must now find the definition of each of them, the answer, that 
<A NAME="861"></A>is, to the question, 'what is' flesh, semen, and the rest? For we know 
<A NAME="862"></A>the cause of a thing and its definition when we know the material or the 
<A NAME="863"></A>formal or, better, both the material and the formal conditions of its generation 
<A NAME="864"></A>and destruction, and the efficient cause of it.
<A NAME="865"></A><BR><BR>After the homogeneous bodies have been explained we must consider 
<A NAME="866"></A>the non-homogeneous too, and lastly the bodies made up of these, such as 
<A NAME="867"></A>man, plants, and the rest.
