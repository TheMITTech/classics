<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Holding as we do that, while knowledge of any kind is a thing to be honoured 
<A NAME="12"></A>and prized, one kind of it may, either by reason of its greater exactness 
<A NAME="13"></A>or of a higher dignity and greater wonderfulness in its objects, be more 
<A NAME="14"></A>honourable and precious than another, on both accounts we should naturally 
<A NAME="15"></A>be led to place in the front rank the study of the soul. The knowledge 
<A NAME="16"></A>of the soul admittedly contributes greatly to the advance of truth in general, 
<A NAME="17"></A>and, above all, to our understanding of Nature, for the soul is in some 
<A NAME="18"></A>sense the principle of animal life. Our aim is to grasp and understand, 
<A NAME="19"></A>first its essential nature, and secondly its properties; of these some 
<A NAME="20"></A>are taught to be affections proper to the soul itself, while others are 
<A NAME="21"></A>considered to attach to the animal owing to the presence within it of 
<A NAME="22"></A>soul.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR>To attain any assured knowledge about the soul is one of the most 
<A NAME="24"></A>difficult things in the world. As the form of question which here presents 
<A NAME="25"></A>itself, viz. the question 'What is it?', recurs in other fields, it might 
<A NAME="26"></A>be supposed that there was some single method of inquiry applicable to 
<A NAME="27"></A>all objects whose essential nature (as we are endeavouring to ascertain 
<A NAME="28"></A>there is for derived properties the single method of demonstration); in 
<A NAME="29"></A>that case what we should have to seek for would be this unique method. 
<A NAME="30"></A>But if there is no such single and general method for solving the question 
<A NAME="31"></A>of essence, our task becomes still more difficult; in the case of each 
<A NAME="32"></A>different subject we shall have to determine the appropriate process of 
<A NAME="33"></A>investigation. If to this there be a clear answer, e.g. that the process 
<A NAME="34"></A>is demonstration or division, or some known method, difficulties and hesitations 
<A NAME="35"></A>still beset us-with what facts shall we begin the inquiry? For the facts 
<A NAME="36"></A>which form the starting-points in different subjects must be different, 
<A NAME="37"></A>as e.g. in the case of numbers and surfaces.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>First, no doubt, it is necessary to determine in which of the summa 
<A NAME="39"></A>genera soul lies, what it is; is it 'a this-somewhat, 'a substance, or 
<A NAME="40"></A>is it a quale or a quantum, or some other of the remaining kinds of predicates 
<A NAME="41"></A>which we have distinguished? Further, does soul belong to the class of 
<A NAME="42"></A>potential existents, or is it not rather an actuality? Our answer to this 
<A NAME="43"></A>question is of the greatest importance.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>We must consider also whether soul is divisible or is without parts, 
<A NAME="45"></A>and whether it is everywhere homogeneous or not; and if not homogeneous, 
<A NAME="46"></A>whether its various forms are different specifically or generically: up 
<A NAME="47"></A>to the present time those who have discussed and investigated soul seem 
<A NAME="48"></A>to have confined themselves to the human soul. We must be careful not to 
<A NAME="49"></A>ignore the question whether soul can be defined in a single unambiguous 
<A NAME="50"></A>formula, as is the case with animal, or whether we must not give a separate 
<A NAME="51"></A>formula for each of it, as we do for horse, dog, man, god (in the latter 
<A NAME="52"></A>case the 'universal' animal-and so too every other 'common predicate'-being 
<A NAME="53"></A>treated either as nothing at all or as a later product). Further, if what 
<A NAME="54"></A>exists is not a plurality of souls, but a plurality of parts of one soul, 
<A NAME="55"></A>which ought we to investigate first, the whole soul or its parts? (It is 
<A NAME="56"></A>also a difficult problem to decide which of these parts are in nature distinct 
<A NAME="57"></A>from one another.) Again, which ought we to investigate first, these parts 
<A NAME="58"></A>or their functions, mind or thinking, the faculty or the act of sensation, 
<A NAME="59"></A>and so on? If the investigation of the functions precedes that of the parts, 
<A NAME="60"></A>the further question suggests itself: ought we not before either to consider 
<A NAME="61"></A>the correlative objects, e.g. of sense or thought? It seems not only useful 
<A NAME="62"></A>for the discovery of the causes of the derived properties of substances 
<A NAME="63"></A>to be acquainted with the essential nature of those substances (as in mathematics 
<A NAME="64"></A>it is useful for the understanding of the property of the equality of the 
<A NAME="65"></A>interior angles of a triangle to two right angles to know the essential 
<A NAME="66"></A>nature of the straight and the curved or of the line and the plane) but 
<A NAME="67"></A>also conversely, for the knowledge of the essential nature of a substance 
<A NAME="68"></A>is largely promoted by an acquaintance with its properties: for, when we 
<A NAME="69"></A>are able to give an account conformable to experience of all or most of 
<A NAME="70"></A>the properties of a substance, we shall be in the most favourable position 
<A NAME="71"></A>to say something worth saying about the essential nature of that subject; 
<A NAME="72"></A>in all demonstration a definition of the essence is required as a starting-point, 
<A NAME="73"></A>so that definitions which do not enable us to discover the derived properties, 
<A NAME="74"></A>or which fail to facilitate even a conjecture about them, must obviously, 
<A NAME="75"></A>one and all, be dialectical and futile.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>A further problem presented by the affections of soul is this: 
<A NAME="77"></A>are they all affections of the complex of body and soul, or is there any 
<A NAME="78"></A>one among them peculiar to the soul by itself? To determine this is indispensable 
<A NAME="79"></A>but difficult. If we consider the majority of them, there seems to be no 
<A NAME="80"></A>case in which the soul can act or be acted upon without involving the body; 
<A NAME="81"></A>e.g. anger, courage, appetite, and sensation generally. Thinking seems 
<A NAME="82"></A>the most probable exception; but if this too proves to be a form of imagination 
<A NAME="83"></A>or to be impossible without imagination, it too requires a body as a condition 
<A NAME="84"></A>of its existence. If there is any way of acting or being acted upon proper 
<A NAME="85"></A>to soul, soul will be capable of separate existence; if there is none, 
<A NAME="86"></A>its separate existence is impossible. In the latter case, it will be like 
<A NAME="87"></A>what is straight, which has many properties arising from the straightness 
<A NAME="88"></A>in it, e.g. that of touching a bronze sphere at a point, though straightness 
<A NAME="89"></A>divorced from the other constituents of the straight thing cannot touch 
<A NAME="90"></A>it in this way; it cannot be so divorced at all, since it is always found 
<A NAME="91"></A>in a body. It therefore seems that all the affections of soul involve a 
<A NAME="92"></A>body-passion, gentleness, fear, pity, courage, joy, loving, and hating; 
<A NAME="93"></A>in all these there is a concurrent affection of the body. In support of 
<A NAME="94"></A>this we may point to the fact that, while sometimes on the occasion of 
<A NAME="95"></A>violent and striking occurrences there is no excitement or fear felt, on 
<A NAME="96"></A>others faint and feeble stimulations produce these emotions, viz. when 
<A NAME="97"></A>the body is already in a state of tension resembling its condition when 
<A NAME="98"></A>we are angry. Here is a still clearer case: in the absence of any external 
<A NAME="99"></A>cause of terror we find ourselves experiencing the feelings of a man in 
<A NAME="100"></A>terror. From all this it is obvious that the affections of soul are enmattered 
<A NAME="101"></A>formulable essences.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>Consequently their definitions ought to correspond, e.g. anger 
<A NAME="103"></A>should be defined as a certain mode of movement of such and such a body 
<A NAME="104"></A>(or part or faculty of a body) by this or that cause and for this or that 
<A NAME="105"></A>end. That is precisely why the study of the soul must fall within the science 
<A NAME="106"></A>of Nature, at least so far as in its affections it manifests this double 
<A NAME="107"></A>character. Hence a physicist would define an affection of soul differently 
<A NAME="108"></A>from a dialectician; the latter would define e.g. anger as the appetite 
<A NAME="109"></A>for returning pain for pain, or something like that, while the former would 
<A NAME="110"></A>define it as a boiling of the blood or warm substance surround the heart. 
<A NAME="111"></A>The latter assigns the material conditions, the former the form or formulable 
<A NAME="112"></A>essence; for what he states is the formulable essence of the fact, though 
<A NAME="113"></A>for its actual existence there must be embodiment of it in a material such 
<A NAME="114"></A>as is described by the other. Thus the essence of a house is assigned in 
<A NAME="115"></A>such a formula as 'a shelter against destruction by wind, rain, and heat'; 
<A NAME="116"></A>the physicist would describe it as 'stones, bricks, and timbers'; but there 
<A NAME="117"></A>is a third possible description which would say that it was that form in 
<A NAME="118"></A>that material with that purpose or end. Which, then, among these is entitled 
<A NAME="119"></A>to be regarded as the genuine physicist? The one who confines himself to 
<A NAME="120"></A>the material, or the one who restricts himself to the formulable essence 
<A NAME="121"></A>alone? Is it not rather the one who combines both in a single formula? 
<A NAME="122"></A>If this is so, how are we to characterize the other two? Must we not say 
<A NAME="123"></A>that there is no type of thinker who concerns himself with those qualities 
<A NAME="124"></A>or attributes of the material which are in fact inseparable from the material, 
<A NAME="125"></A>and without attempting even in thought to separate them? The physicist 
<A NAME="126"></A>is he who concerns himself with all the properties active and passive of 
<A NAME="127"></A>bodies or materials thus or thus defined; attributes not considered as 
<A NAME="128"></A>being of this character he leaves to others, in certain cases it may be 
<A NAME="129"></A>to a specialist, e.g. a carpenter or a physician, in others (a) where they 
<A NAME="130"></A>are inseparable in fact, but are separable from any particular kind of 
<A NAME="131"></A>body by an effort of abstraction, to the mathematician, (b) where they 
<A NAME="132"></A>are separate both in fact and in thought from body altogether, to the First 
<A NAME="133"></A>Philosopher or metaphysician. But we must return from this digression, 
<A NAME="134"></A>and repeat that the affections of soul are inseparable from the material 
<A NAME="135"></A>substratum of animal life, to which we have seen that such affections, 
<A NAME="136"></A>e.g. passion and fear, attach, and have not the same mode of being as a 
<A NAME="137"></A>line or a plane.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="138"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>For our study of soul it is necessary, while formulating the problems 
<A NAME="140"></A>of which in our further advance we are to find the solutions, to call into 
<A NAME="141"></A>council the views of those of our predecessors who have declared any opinion 
<A NAME="142"></A>on this subject, in order that we may profit by whatever is sound in their 
<A NAME="143"></A>suggestions and avoid their errors.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>The starting-point of our inquiry is an exposition of those characteristics 
<A NAME="145"></A>which have chiefly been held to belong to soul in its very nature. Two 
<A NAME="146"></A>characteristic marks have above all others been recognized as distinguishing 
<A NAME="147"></A>that which has soul in it from that which has not-movement and sensation. 
<A NAME="148"></A>It may be said that these two are what our predecessors have fixed upon 
<A NAME="149"></A>as characteristic of soul.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>Some say that what originates movement is both pre-eminently and 
<A NAME="151"></A>primarily soul; believing that what is not itself moved cannot originate 
<A NAME="152"></A>movement in another, they arrived at the view that soul belongs to the 
<A NAME="153"></A>class of things in movement. This is what led Democritus to say that soul 
<A NAME="154"></A>is a sort of fire or hot substance; his 'forms' or atoms are infinite in 
<A NAME="155"></A>number; those which are spherical he calls fire and soul, and compares 
<A NAME="156"></A>them to the motes in the air which we see in shafts of light coming through 
<A NAME="157"></A>windows; the mixture of seeds of all sorts he calls the elements of the 
<A NAME="158"></A>whole of Nature (Leucippus gives a similar account); the spherical atoms 
<A NAME="159"></A>are identified with soul because atoms of that shape are most adapted to 
<A NAME="160"></A>permeate everywhere, and to set all the others moving by being themselves 
<A NAME="161"></A>in movement. This implies the view that soul is identical with what produces 
<A NAME="162"></A>movement in animals. That is why, further, they regard respiration as the 
<A NAME="163"></A>characteristic mark of life; as the environment compresses the bodies of 
<A NAME="164"></A>animals, and tends to extrude those atoms which impart movement to them, 
<A NAME="165"></A>because they themselves are never at rest, there must be a reinforcement 
<A NAME="166"></A>of these by similar atoms coming in from without in the act of respiration; 
<A NAME="167"></A>for they prevent the extrusion of those which are already within by counteracting 
<A NAME="168"></A>the compressing and consolidating force of the environment; and animals 
<A NAME="169"></A>continue to live only so long as they are able to maintain this 
<A NAME="170"></A>resistance.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>The doctrine of the Pythagoreans seems to rest upon the same ideas; 
<A NAME="172"></A>some of them declared the motes in air, others what moved them, to be soul. 
<A NAME="173"></A>These motes were referred to because they are seen always in movement, 
<A NAME="174"></A>even in a complete calm.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>The same tendency is shown by those who define soul as that which 
<A NAME="176"></A>moves itself; all seem to hold the view that movement is what is closest 
<A NAME="177"></A>to the nature of soul, and that while all else is moved by soul, it alone 
<A NAME="178"></A>moves itself. This belief arises from their never seeing anything originating 
<A NAME="179"></A>movement which is not first itself moved.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>Similarly also Anaxagoras (and whoever agrees with him in saying 
<A NAME="181"></A>that mind set the whole in movement) declares the moving cause of things 
<A NAME="182"></A>to be soul. His position must, however, be distinguished from that of Democritus. 
<A NAME="183"></A>Democritus roundly identifies soul and mind, for he identifies what appears 
<A NAME="184"></A>with what is true-that is why he commends Homer for the phrase 'Hector 
<A NAME="185"></A>lay with thought distraught'; he does not employ mind as a special faculty 
<A NAME="186"></A>dealing with truth, but identifies soul and mind. What Anaxagoras says 
<A NAME="187"></A>about them is more obscure; in many places he tells us that the cause of 
<A NAME="188"></A>beauty and order is mind, elsewhere that it is soul; it is found, he says, 
<A NAME="189"></A>in all animals, great and small, high and low, but mind (in the sense of 
<A NAME="190"></A>intelligence) appears not to belong alike to all animals, and indeed not 
<A NAME="191"></A>even to all human beings.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>All those, then, who had special regard to the fact that what has 
<A NAME="193"></A>soul in it is moved, adopted the view that soul is to be identified with 
<A NAME="194"></A>what is eminently originative of movement. All, on the other hand, who 
<A NAME="195"></A>looked to the fact that what has soul in it knows or perceives what is, 
<A NAME="196"></A>identify soul with the principle or principles of Nature, according as 
<A NAME="197"></A>they admit several such principles or one only. Thus Empedocles declares 
<A NAME="198"></A>that it is formed out of all his elements, each of them also being soul; 
<A NAME="199"></A>his words are:
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>For 'tis by Earth we see Earth, by Water Water,
<A NAME="201"></A><BR>By Ether Ether divine, by Fire destructive Fire,
<A NAME="202"></A><BR>By Love Love, and Hate by cruel Hate.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>In the same way Plato in the Timaeus fashions soul out of his elements; 
<A NAME="204"></A>for like, he holds, is known by like, and things are formed out of the 
<A NAME="205"></A>principles or elements, so that soul must be so too. Similarly also in 
<A NAME="206"></A>his lectures 'On Philosophy' it was set forth that the Animal-itself is 
<A NAME="207"></A>compounded of the Idea itself of the One together with the primary length, 
<A NAME="208"></A>breadth, and depth, everything else, the objects of its perception, being 
<A NAME="209"></A>similarly constituted. Again he puts his view in yet other terms: Mind 
<A NAME="210"></A>is the monad, science or knowledge the dyad (because it goes undeviatingly 
<A NAME="211"></A>from one point to another), opinion the number of the plane, sensation 
<A NAME="212"></A>the number of the solid; the numbers are by him expressly identified with 
<A NAME="213"></A>the Forms themselves or principles, and are formed out of the elements; 
<A NAME="214"></A>now things are apprehended either by mind or science or opinion or sensation, 
<A NAME="215"></A>and these same numbers are the Forms of things.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>Some thinkers, accepting both premisses, viz. that the soul is 
<A NAME="217"></A>both originative of movement and cognitive, have compounded it of both 
<A NAME="218"></A>and declared the soul to be a self-moving number.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>As to the nature and number of the first principles opinions differ. 
<A NAME="220"></A>The difference is greatest between those who regard them as corporeal and 
<A NAME="221"></A>those who regard them as incorporeal, and from both dissent those who make 
<A NAME="222"></A>a blend and draw their principles from both sources. The number of principles 
<A NAME="223"></A>is also in dispute; some admit one only, others assert several. There is 
<A NAME="224"></A>a consequent diversity in their several accounts of soul; they assume, 
<A NAME="225"></A>naturally enough, that what is in its own nature originative of movement 
<A NAME="226"></A>must be among what is primordial. That has led some to regard it as fire, 
<A NAME="227"></A>for fire is the subtlest of the elements and nearest to incorporeality; 
<A NAME="228"></A>further, in the most primary sense, fire both is moved and originates movement 
<A NAME="229"></A>in all the others.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>Democritus has expressed himself more ingeniously than the rest 
<A NAME="231"></A>on the grounds for ascribing each of these two characters to soul; soul 
<A NAME="232"></A>and mind are, he says, one and the same thing, and this thing must be one 
<A NAME="233"></A>of the primary and indivisible bodies, and its power of originating movement 
<A NAME="234"></A>must be due to its fineness of grain and the shape of its atoms; he says 
<A NAME="235"></A>that of all the shapes the spherical is the most mobile, and that this 
<A NAME="236"></A>is the shape of the particles of fire and mind.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>Anaxagoras, as we said above, seems to distinguish between soul 
<A NAME="238"></A>and mind, but in practice he treats them as a single substance, except 
<A NAME="239"></A>that it is mind that he specially posits as the principle of all things; 
<A NAME="240"></A>at any rate what he says is that mind alone of all that is simple, unmixed, 
<A NAME="241"></A>and pure. He assigns both characteristics, knowing and origination of movement, 
<A NAME="242"></A>to the same principle, when he says that it was mind that set the whole 
<A NAME="243"></A>in movement.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>Thales, too, to judge from what is recorded about him, seems to 
<A NAME="245"></A>have held soul to be a motive force, since he said that the magnet has 
<A NAME="246"></A>a soul in it because it moves the iron.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>Diogenes (and others) held the soul to be air because he believed 
<A NAME="248"></A>air to be finest in grain and a first principle; therein lay the grounds 
<A NAME="249"></A>of the soul's powers of knowing and originating movement. As the primordial 
<A NAME="250"></A>principle from which all other things are derived, it is cognitive; as 
<A NAME="251"></A>finest in grain, it has the power to originate movement.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>Heraclitus too says that the first principle-the 'warm exhalation' 
<A NAME="253"></A>of which, according to him, everything else is composed-is soul; further, 
<A NAME="254"></A>that this exhalation is most incorporeal and in ceaseless flux; that what 
<A NAME="255"></A>is in movement requires that what knows it should be in movement; and that 
<A NAME="256"></A>all that is has its being essentially in movement (herein agreeing with 
<A NAME="257"></A>the majority).
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>Alcmaeon also seems to have held a similar view about soul; he 
<A NAME="259"></A>says that it is immortal because it resembles 'the immortals,' and that 
<A NAME="260"></A>this immortality belongs to it in virtue of its ceaseless movement; for 
<A NAME="261"></A>all the 'things divine,' moon, sun, the planets, and the whole heavens, 
<A NAME="262"></A>are in perpetual movement.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>of More superficial writers, some, e.g. Hippo, have pronounced 
<A NAME="264"></A>it to be water; they seem to have argued from the fact that the seed of 
<A NAME="265"></A>all animals is fluid, for Hippo tries to refute those who say that the 
<A NAME="266"></A>soul is blood, on the ground that the seed, which is the primordial soul, 
<A NAME="267"></A>is not blood.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>Another group (Critias, for example) did hold it to be blood; they 
<A NAME="269"></A>take perception to be the most characteristic attribute of soul, and hold 
<A NAME="270"></A>that perceptiveness is due to the nature of blood.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>Each of the elements has thus found its partisan, except earth-earth 
<A NAME="272"></A>has found no supporter unless we count as such those who have declared 
<A NAME="273"></A>soul to be, or to be compounded of, all the elements. All, then, it may 
<A NAME="274"></A>be said, characterize the soul by three marks, Movement, Sensation, Incorporeality, 
<A NAME="275"></A>and each of these is traced back to the first principles. That is why (with 
<A NAME="276"></A>one exception) all those who define the soul by its power of knowing make 
<A NAME="277"></A>it either an element or constructed out of the elements. The language they 
<A NAME="278"></A>all use is similar; like, they say, is known by like; as the soul knows 
<A NAME="279"></A>everything, they construct it out of all the principles. Hence all those 
<A NAME="280"></A>who admit but one cause or element, make the soul also one (e.g. fire or 
<A NAME="281"></A>air), while those who admit a multiplicity of principles make the soul 
<A NAME="282"></A>also multiple. The exception is Anaxagoras; he alone says that mind is 
<A NAME="283"></A>impassible and has nothing in common with anything else. But, if this is 
<A NAME="284"></A>so, how or in virtue of what cause can it know? That Anaxagoras has not 
<A NAME="285"></A>explained, nor can any answer be inferred from his words. All who acknowledge 
<A NAME="286"></A>pairs of opposites among their principles, construct the soul also out 
<A NAME="287"></A>of these contraries, while those who admit as principles only one contrary 
<A NAME="288"></A>of each pair, e.g. either hot or cold, likewise make the soul some one 
<A NAME="289"></A>of these. That is why, also, they allow themselves to be guided by the 
<A NAME="290"></A>names; those who identify soul with the hot argue that sen (to live) is 
<A NAME="291"></A>derived from sein (to boil), while those who identify it with the cold 
<A NAME="292"></A>say that soul (psuche) is so called from the process of respiration and 
<A NAME="293"></A>(katapsuxis). Such are the traditional opinions concerning soul, together 
<A NAME="294"></A>with the grounds on which they are maintained.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="295"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>We must begin our examination with movement; for doubtless, not 
<A NAME="297"></A>only is it false that the essence of soul is correctly described by those 
<A NAME="298"></A>who say that it is what moves (or is capable of moving) itself, but it 
<A NAME="299"></A>is an impossibility that movement should be even an attribute of 
<A NAME="300"></A>it.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>We have already pointed out that there is no necessity that what 
<A NAME="302"></A>originates movement should itself be moved. There are two senses in which 
<A NAME="303"></A>anything may be moved-either (a) indirectly, owing to something other than 
<A NAME="304"></A>itself, or (b) directly, owing to itself. Things are 'indirectly moved' 
<A NAME="305"></A>which are moved as being contained in something which is moved, e.g. sailors 
<A NAME="306"></A>in a ship, for they are moved in a different sense from that in which the 
<A NAME="307"></A>ship is moved; the ship is 'directly moved', they are 'indirectly moved', 
<A NAME="308"></A>because they are in a moving vessel. This is clear if we consider their 
<A NAME="309"></A>limbs; the movement proper to the legs (and so to man) is walking, and 
<A NAME="310"></A>in this case the sailors tare not walking. Recognizing the double sense 
<A NAME="311"></A>of 'being moved', what we have to consider now is whether the soul is 'directly 
<A NAME="312"></A>moved' and participates in such direct movement.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>There are four species of movement-locomotion, alteration, diminution, 
<A NAME="314"></A>growth; consequently if the soul is moved, it must be moved with one or 
<A NAME="315"></A>several or all of these species of movement. Now if its movement is not 
<A NAME="316"></A>incidental, there must be a movement natural to it, and, if so, as all 
<A NAME="317"></A>the species enumerated involve place, place must be natural to it. But 
<A NAME="318"></A>if the essence of soul be to move itself, its being moved cannot be incidental 
<A NAME="319"></A>to-as it is to what is white or three cubits long; they too can be moved, 
<A NAME="320"></A>but only incidentally-what is moved is that of which 'white' and 'three 
<A NAME="321"></A>cubits long' are the attributes, the body in which they inhere; hence they 
<A NAME="322"></A>have no place: but if the soul naturally partakes in movement, it follows 
<A NAME="323"></A>that it must have a place.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>Further, if there be a movement natural to the soul, there must 
<A NAME="325"></A>be a counter-movement unnatural to it, and conversely. The same applies 
<A NAME="326"></A>to rest as well as to movement; for the terminus ad quem of a thing's natural 
<A NAME="327"></A>movement is the place of its natural rest, and similarly the terminus ad 
<A NAME="328"></A>quem of its enforced movement is the place of its enforced rest. But what 
<A NAME="329"></A>meaning can be attached to enforced movements or rests of the soul, it 
<A NAME="330"></A>is difficult even to imagine.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>Further, if the natural movement of the soul be upward, the soul 
<A NAME="332"></A>must be fire; if downward, it must be earth; for upward and downward movements 
<A NAME="333"></A>are the definitory characteristics of these bodies. The same reasoning 
<A NAME="334"></A>applies to the intermediate movements, termini, and bodies. Further, since 
<A NAME="335"></A>the soul is observed to originate movement in the body, it is reasonable 
<A NAME="336"></A>to suppose that it transmits to the body the movements by which it itself 
<A NAME="337"></A>is moved, and so, reversing the order, we may infer from the movements 
<A NAME="338"></A>of the body back to similar movements of the soul. Now the body is moved 
<A NAME="339"></A>from place to place with movements of locomotion. Hence it would follow 
<A NAME="340"></A>that the soul too must in accordance with the body change either its place 
<A NAME="341"></A>as a whole or the relative places of its parts. This carries with it the 
<A NAME="342"></A>possibility that the soul might even quit its body and re-enter it, and 
<A NAME="343"></A>with this would be involved the possibility of a resurrection of animals 
<A NAME="344"></A>from the dead. But, it may be contended, the soul can be moved indirectly 
<A NAME="345"></A>by something else; for an animal can be pushed out of its course. Yes, 
<A NAME="346"></A>but that to whose essence belongs the power of being moved by itself, cannot 
<A NAME="347"></A>be moved by something else except incidentally, just as what is good by 
<A NAME="348"></A>or in itself cannot owe its goodness to something external to it or to 
<A NAME="349"></A>some end to which it is a means.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>If the soul is moved, the most probable view is that what moves 
<A NAME="351"></A>it is sensible things.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>We must note also that, if the soul moves itself, it must be the 
<A NAME="353"></A>mover itself that is moved, so that it follows that if movement is in every 
<A NAME="354"></A>case a displacement of that which is in movement, in that respect in which 
<A NAME="355"></A>it is said to be moved, the movement of the soul must be a departure from 
<A NAME="356"></A>its essential nature, at least if its self-movement is essential to it, 
<A NAME="357"></A>not incidental.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>Some go so far as to hold that the movements which the soul imparts 
<A NAME="359"></A>to the body in which it is are the same in kind as those with which it 
<A NAME="360"></A>itself is moved. An example of this is Democritus, who uses language like 
<A NAME="361"></A>that of the comic dramatist Philippus, who accounts for the movements that 
<A NAME="362"></A>Daedalus imparted to his wooden Aphrodite by saying that he poured quicksilver 
<A NAME="363"></A>into it; similarly Democritus says that the spherical atoms which according 
<A NAME="364"></A>to him constitute soul, owing to their own ceaseless movements draw the 
<A NAME="365"></A>whole body after them and so produce its movements. We must urge the question 
<A NAME="366"></A>whether it is these very same atoms which produce rest also-how they could 
<A NAME="367"></A>do so, it is difficult and even impossible to say. And, in general, we 
<A NAME="368"></A>may object that it is not in this way that the soul appears to originate 
<A NAME="369"></A>movement in animals-it is through intention or process of 
<A NAME="370"></A>thinking.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>It is in the same fashion that the Timaeus also tries to give a 
<A NAME="372"></A>physical account of how the soul moves its body; the soul, it is there 
<A NAME="373"></A>said, is in movement, and so owing to their mutual implication moves the 
<A NAME="374"></A>body also. After compounding the soul-substance out of the elements and 
<A NAME="375"></A>dividing it in accordance with the harmonic numbers, in order that it may 
<A NAME="376"></A>possess a connate sensibility for 'harmony' and that the whole may move 
<A NAME="377"></A>in movements well attuned, the Demiurge bent the straight line into a circle; 
<A NAME="378"></A>this single circle he divided into two circles united at two common points; 
<A NAME="379"></A>one of these he subdivided into seven circles. All this implies that the 
<A NAME="380"></A>movements of the soul are identified with the local movements of the 
<A NAME="381"></A>heavens.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>Now, in the first place, it is a mistake to say that the soul is 
<A NAME="383"></A>a spatial magnitude. It is evident that Plato means the soul of the whole 
<A NAME="384"></A>to be like the sort of soul which is called mind not like the sensitive 
<A NAME="385"></A>or the desiderative soul, for the movements of neither of these are circular. 
<A NAME="386"></A>Now mind is one and continuous in the sense in which the process of thinking 
<A NAME="387"></A>is so, and thinking is identical with the thoughts which are its parts; 
<A NAME="388"></A>these have a serial unity like that of number, not a unity like that of 
<A NAME="389"></A>a spatial magnitude. Hence mind cannot have that kind of unity either; 
<A NAME="390"></A>mind is either without parts or is continuous in some other way than that 
<A NAME="391"></A>which characterizes a spatial magnitude. How, indeed, if it were a spatial 
<A NAME="392"></A>magnitude, could mind possibly think? Will it think with any one indifferently 
<A NAME="393"></A>of its parts? In this case, the 'part' must be understood either in the 
<A NAME="394"></A>sense of a spatial magnitude or in the sense of a point (if a point can 
<A NAME="395"></A>be called a part of a spatial magnitude). If we accept the latter alternative, 
<A NAME="396"></A>the points being infinite in number, obviously the mind can never exhaustively 
<A NAME="397"></A>traverse them; if the former, the mind must think the same thing over and 
<A NAME="398"></A>over again, indeed an infinite number of times (whereas it is manifestly 
<A NAME="399"></A>possible to think a thing once only). If contact of any part whatsoever 
<A NAME="400"></A>of itself with the object is all that is required, why need mind move in 
<A NAME="401"></A>a circle, or indeed possess magnitude at all? On the other hand, if contact 
<A NAME="402"></A>with the whole circle is necessary, what meaning can be given to the contact 
<A NAME="403"></A>of the parts? Further, how could what has no parts think what has parts, 
<A NAME="404"></A>or what has parts think what has none? We must identify the circle referred 
<A NAME="405"></A>to with mind; for it is mind whose movement is thinking, and it is the 
<A NAME="406"></A>circle whose movement is revolution, so that if thinking is a movement 
<A NAME="407"></A>of revolution, the circle which has this characteristic movement must be 
<A NAME="408"></A>mind.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>If the circular movement is eternal, there must be something which 
<A NAME="410"></A>mind is always thinking-what can this be? For all practical processes of 
<A NAME="411"></A>thinking have limits-they all go on for the sake of something outside the 
<A NAME="412"></A>process, and all theoretical processes come to a close in the same way 
<A NAME="413"></A>as the phrases in speech which express processes and results of thinking. 
<A NAME="414"></A>Every such linguistic phrase is either definitory or demonstrative. Demonstration 
<A NAME="415"></A>has both a starting-point and may be said to end in a conclusion or inferred 
<A NAME="416"></A>result; even if the process never reaches final completion, at any rate 
<A NAME="417"></A>it never returns upon itself again to its starting-point, it goes on assuming 
<A NAME="418"></A>a fresh middle term or a fresh extreme, and moves straight forward, but 
<A NAME="419"></A>circular movement returns to its starting-point. Definitions, too, are 
<A NAME="420"></A>closed groups of terms.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>Further, if the same revolution is repeated, mind must repeatedly 
<A NAME="422"></A>think the same object.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>Further, thinking has more resemblance to a coming to rest or arrest 
<A NAME="424"></A>than to a movement; the same may be said of inferring.
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>It might also be urged that what is difficult and enforced is incompatible 
<A NAME="426"></A>with blessedness; if the movement of the soul is not of its essence, movement 
<A NAME="427"></A>of the soul must be contrary to its nature. It must also be painful for 
<A NAME="428"></A>the soul to be inextricably bound up with the body; nay more, if, as is 
<A NAME="429"></A>frequently said and widely accepted, it is better for mind not to be embodied, 
<A NAME="430"></A>the union must be for it undesirable.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR>Further, the cause of the revolution of the heavens is left obscure. 
<A NAME="432"></A>It is not the essence of soul which is the cause of this circular movement-that 
<A NAME="433"></A>movement is only incidental to soul-nor is, a fortiori, the body its cause. 
<A NAME="434"></A>Again, it is not even asserted that it is better that soul should be so 
<A NAME="435"></A>moved; and yet the reason for which God caused the soul to move in a circle 
<A NAME="436"></A>can only have been that movement was better for it than rest, and movement 
<A NAME="437"></A>of this kind better than any other. But since this sort of consideration 
<A NAME="438"></A>is more appropriate to another field of speculation, let us dismiss it 
<A NAME="439"></A>for the present.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>The view we have just been examining, in company with most theories 
<A NAME="441"></A>about the soul, involves the following absurdity: they all join the soul 
<A NAME="442"></A>to a body, or place it in a body, without adding any specification of the 
<A NAME="443"></A>reason of their union, or of the bodily conditions required for it. Yet 
<A NAME="444"></A>such explanation can scarcely be omitted; for some community of nature 
<A NAME="445"></A>is presupposed by the fact that the one acts and the other is acted upon, 
<A NAME="446"></A>the one moves and the other is moved; interaction always implies a special 
<A NAME="447"></A>nature in the two interagents. All, however, that these thinkers do is 
<A NAME="448"></A>to describe the specific characteristics of the soul; they do not try to 
<A NAME="449"></A>determine anything about the body which is to contain it, as if it were 
<A NAME="450"></A>possible, as in the Pythagorean myths, that any soul could be clothed upon 
<A NAME="451"></A>with any body-an absurd view, for each body seems to have a form and shape 
<A NAME="452"></A>of its own. It is as absurd as to say that the art of carpentry could embody 
<A NAME="453"></A>itself in flutes; each art must use its tools, each soul its 
<A NAME="454"></A>body.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="455"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>There is yet another theory about soul, which has commended itself 
<A NAME="457"></A>to many as no less probable than any of those we have hitherto mentioned, 
<A NAME="458"></A>and has rendered public account of itself in the court of popular discussion. 
<A NAME="459"></A>Its supporters say that the soul is a kind of harmony, for (a) harmony 
<A NAME="460"></A>is a blend or composition of contraries, and (b) the body is compounded 
<A NAME="461"></A>out of contraries. Harmony, however, is a certain proportion or composition 
<A NAME="462"></A>of the constituents blended, and soul can be neither the one nor the other 
<A NAME="463"></A>of these. Further, the power of originating movement cannot belong to a 
<A NAME="464"></A>harmony, while almost all concur in regarding this as a principal attribute 
<A NAME="465"></A>of soul. It is more appropriate to call health (or generally one of the 
<A NAME="466"></A>good states of the body) a harmony than to predicate it of the soul. The 
<A NAME="467"></A>absurdity becomes most apparent when we try to attribute the active and 
<A NAME="468"></A>passive affections of the soul to a harmony; the necessary readjustment 
<A NAME="469"></A>of their conceptions is difficult. Further, in using the word 'harmony' 
<A NAME="470"></A>we have one or other of two cases in our mind; the most proper sense is 
<A NAME="471"></A>in relation to spatial magnitudes which have motion and position, where 
<A NAME="472"></A>harmony means the disposition and cohesion of their parts in such a manner 
<A NAME="473"></A>as to prevent the introduction into the whole of anything homogeneous with 
<A NAME="474"></A>it, and the secondary sense, derived from the former, is that in which 
<A NAME="475"></A>it means the ratio between the constituents so blended; in neither of these 
<A NAME="476"></A>senses is it plausible to predicate it of soul. That soul is a harmony 
<A NAME="477"></A>in the sense of the mode of composition of the parts of the body is a view 
<A NAME="478"></A>easily refutable; for there are many composite parts and those variously 
<A NAME="479"></A>compounded; of what bodily part is mind or the sensitive or the appetitive 
<A NAME="480"></A>faculty the mode of composition? And what is the mode of composition which 
<A NAME="481"></A>constitutes each of them? It is equally absurd to identify the soul with 
<A NAME="482"></A>the ratio of the mixture; for the mixture which makes flesh has a different 
<A NAME="483"></A>ratio between the elements from that which makes bone. The consequence 
<A NAME="484"></A>of this view will therefore be that distributed throughout the whole body 
<A NAME="485"></A>there will be many souls, since every one of the bodily parts is a different 
<A NAME="486"></A>mixture of the elements, and the ratio of mixture is in each case a harmony, 
<A NAME="487"></A>i.e. a soul.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR>From Empedocles at any rate we might demand an answer to the following 
<A NAME="489"></A>question for he says that each of the parts of the body is what it is in 
<A NAME="490"></A>virtue of a ratio between the elements: is the soul identical with this 
<A NAME="491"></A>ratio, or is it not rather something over and above this which is formed 
<A NAME="492"></A>in the parts? Is love the cause of any and every mixture, or only of those 
<A NAME="493"></A>that are in the right ratio? Is love this ratio itself, or is love something 
<A NAME="494"></A>over and above this? Such are the problems raised by this account. But, 
<A NAME="495"></A>on the other hand, if the soul is different from the mixture, why does 
<A NAME="496"></A>it disappear at one and the same moment with that relation between the 
<A NAME="497"></A>elements which constitutes flesh or the other parts of the animal body? 
<A NAME="498"></A>Further, if the soul is not identical with the ratio of mixture, and it 
<A NAME="499"></A>is consequently not the case that each of the parts has a soul, what is 
<A NAME="500"></A>that which perishes when the soul quits the body?
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>That the soul cannot either be a harmony, or be moved in a circle, 
<A NAME="502"></A>is clear from what we have said. Yet that it can be moved incidentally 
<A NAME="503"></A>is, as we said above, possible, and even that in a sense it can move itself, 
<A NAME="504"></A>i.e. in the sense that the vehicle in which it is can be moved, and moved 
<A NAME="505"></A>by it; in no other sense can the soul be moved in space.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>More legitimate doubts might remain as to its movement in view 
<A NAME="507"></A>of the following facts. We speak of the soul as being pained or pleased, 
<A NAME="508"></A>being bold or fearful, being angry, perceiving, thinking. All these are 
<A NAME="509"></A>regarded as modes of movement, and hence it might be inferred that the 
<A NAME="510"></A>soul is moved. This, however, does not necessarily follow. We may admit 
<A NAME="511"></A>to the full that being pained or pleased, or thinking, are movements (each 
<A NAME="512"></A>of them a 'being moved'), and that the movement is originated by the soul. 
<A NAME="513"></A>For example we may regard anger or fear as such and such movements of the 
<A NAME="514"></A>heart, and thinking as such and such another movement of that organ, or 
<A NAME="515"></A>of some other; these modifications may arise either from changes of place 
<A NAME="516"></A>in certain parts or from qualitative alterations (the special nature of 
<A NAME="517"></A>the parts and the special modes of their changes being for our present 
<A NAME="518"></A>purpose irrelevant). Yet to say that it is the soul which is angry is as 
<A NAME="519"></A>inexact as it would be to say that it is the soul that weaves webs or builds 
<A NAME="520"></A>houses. It is doubtless better to avoid saying that the soul pities or 
<A NAME="521"></A>learns or thinks and rather to say that it is the man who does this with 
<A NAME="522"></A>his soul. What we mean is not that the movement is in the soul, but that 
<A NAME="523"></A>sometimes it terminates in the soul and sometimes starts from it, sensation 
<A NAME="524"></A>e.g. coming from without inwards, and reminiscence starting from the soul 
<A NAME="525"></A>and terminating with the movements, actual or residual, in the sense 
<A NAME="526"></A>organs.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>The case of mind is different; it seems to be an independent substance 
<A NAME="528"></A>implanted within the soul and to be incapable of being destroyed. If it 
<A NAME="529"></A>could be destroyed at all, it would be under the blunting influence of 
<A NAME="530"></A>old age. What really happens in respect of mind in old age is, however, 
<A NAME="531"></A>exactly parallel to what happens in the case of the sense organs; if the 
<A NAME="532"></A>old man could recover the proper kind of eye, he would see just as well 
<A NAME="533"></A>as the young man. The incapacity of old age is due to an affection not 
<A NAME="534"></A>of the soul but of its vehicle, as occurs in drunkenness or disease. Thus 
<A NAME="535"></A>it is that in old age the activity of mind or intellectual apprehension 
<A NAME="536"></A>declines only through the decay of some other inward part; mind itself 
<A NAME="537"></A>is impassible. Thinking, loving, and hating are affections not of mind, 
<A NAME="538"></A>but of that which has mind, so far as it has it. That is why, when this 
<A NAME="539"></A>vehicle decays, memory and love cease; they were activities not of mind, 
<A NAME="540"></A>but of the composite which has perished; mind is, no doubt, something more 
<A NAME="541"></A>divine and impassible. That the soul cannot be moved is therefore clear 
<A NAME="542"></A>from what we have said, and if it cannot be moved at all, manifestly it 
<A NAME="543"></A>cannot be moved by itself.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR>Of all the opinions we have enumerated, by far the most unreasonable 
<A NAME="545"></A>is that which declares the soul to be a self-moving number; it involves 
<A NAME="546"></A>in the first place all the impossibilities which follow from regarding 
<A NAME="547"></A>the soul as moved, and in the second special absurdities which follow from 
<A NAME="548"></A>calling it a number. How we to imagine a unit being moved? By what agency? 
<A NAME="549"></A>What sort of movement can be attributed to what is without parts or internal 
<A NAME="550"></A>differences? If the unit is both originative of movement and itself capable 
<A NAME="551"></A>of being moved, it must contain difference.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR>Further, since they say a moving line generates a surface and a 
<A NAME="553"></A>moving point a line, the movements of the psychic units must be lines (for 
<A NAME="554"></A>a point is a unit having position, and the number of the soul is, of course, 
<A NAME="555"></A>somewhere and has position).
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>Again, if from a number a number or a unit is subtracted, the remainder 
<A NAME="557"></A>is another number; but plants and many animals when divided continue to 
<A NAME="558"></A>live, and each segment is thought to retain the same kind of 
<A NAME="559"></A>soul.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>It must be all the same whether we speak of units or corpuscles; 
<A NAME="561"></A>for if the spherical atoms of Democritus became points, nothing being retained 
<A NAME="562"></A>but their being a quantum, there must remain in each a moving and a moved 
<A NAME="563"></A>part, just as there is in what is continuous; what happens has nothing 
<A NAME="564"></A>to do with the size of the atoms, it depends solely upon their being a 
<A NAME="565"></A>quantum. That is why there must be something to originate movement in the 
<A NAME="566"></A>units. If in the animal what originates movement is the soul, so also must 
<A NAME="567"></A>it be in the case of the number, so that not the mover and the moved together, 
<A NAME="568"></A>but the mover only, will be the soul. But how is it possible for one of 
<A NAME="569"></A>the units to fulfil this function of originating movement? There must be 
<A NAME="570"></A>some difference between such a unit and all the other units, and what difference 
<A NAME="571"></A>can there be between one placed unit and another except a difference of 
<A NAME="572"></A>position? If then, on the other hand, these psychic units within the body 
<A NAME="573"></A>are different from the points of the body, there will be two sets of units 
<A NAME="574"></A>both occupying the same place; for each unit will occupy a point. And yet, 
<A NAME="575"></A>if there can be two, why cannot there be an infinite number? For if things 
<A NAME="576"></A>can occupy an indivisible lace, they must themselves be indivisible. If, 
<A NAME="577"></A>on the other hand, the points of the body are identical with the units 
<A NAME="578"></A>whose number is the soul, or if the number of the points in the body is 
<A NAME="579"></A>the soul, why have not all bodies souls? For all bodies contain points 
<A NAME="580"></A>or an infinity of points.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR>Further, how is it possible for these points to be isolated or 
<A NAME="582"></A>separated from their bodies, seeing that lines cannot be resolved into 
<A NAME="583"></A>points?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="584"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="585"></A><BR><BR>The result is, as we have said, that this view, while on the one 
<A NAME="586"></A>side identical with that of those who maintain that soul is a subtle kind 
<A NAME="587"></A>of body, is on the other entangled in the absurdity peculiar to Democritus' 
<A NAME="588"></A>way of describing the manner in which movement is originated by soul. For 
<A NAME="589"></A>if the soul is present throughout the whole percipient body, there must, 
<A NAME="590"></A>if the soul be a kind of body, be two bodies in the same place; and for 
<A NAME="591"></A>those who call it a number, there must be many points at one point, or 
<A NAME="592"></A>every body must have a soul, unless the soul be a different sort of number-other, 
<A NAME="593"></A>that is, than the sum of the points existing in a body. Another consequence 
<A NAME="594"></A>that follows is that the animal must be moved by its number precisely in 
<A NAME="595"></A>the way that Democritus explained its being moved by his spherical psychic 
<A NAME="596"></A>atoms. What difference does it make whether we speak of small spheres or 
<A NAME="597"></A>of large units, or, quite simply, of units in movement? One way or another, 
<A NAME="598"></A>the movements of the animal must be due to their movements. Hence those 
<A NAME="599"></A>who combine movement and number in the same subject lay themselves open 
<A NAME="600"></A>to these and many other similar absurdities. It is impossible not only 
<A NAME="601"></A>that these characters should give the definition of soul-it is impossible 
<A NAME="602"></A>that they should even be attributes of it. The point is clear if the attempt 
<A NAME="603"></A>be made to start from this as the account of soul and explain from it the 
<A NAME="604"></A>affections and actions of the soul, e.g. reasoning, sensation, pleasure, 
<A NAME="605"></A>pain, &c. For, to repeat what we have said earlier, movement and number 
<A NAME="606"></A>do not facilitate even conjecture about the derivative properties of 
<A NAME="607"></A>soul.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>Such are the three ways in which soul has traditionally been defined; 
<A NAME="609"></A>one group of thinkers declared it to be that which is most originative 
<A NAME="610"></A>of movement because it moves itself, another group to be the subtlest and 
<A NAME="611"></A>most nearly incorporeal of all kinds of body. We have now sufficiently 
<A NAME="612"></A>set forth the difficulties and inconsistencies to which these theories 
<A NAME="613"></A>are exposed. It remains now to examine the doctrine that soul is composed 
<A NAME="614"></A>of the elements.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>The reason assigned for this doctrine is that thus the soul may 
<A NAME="616"></A>perceive or come to know everything that is, but the theory necessarily 
<A NAME="617"></A>involves itself in many impossibilities. Its upholders assume that like 
<A NAME="618"></A>is known only by like, and imagine that by declaring the soul to be composed 
<A NAME="619"></A>of the elements they succeed in identifying the soul with all the things 
<A NAME="620"></A>it is capable of apprehending. But the elements are not the only things 
<A NAME="621"></A>it knows; there are many others, or, more exactly, an infinite number of 
<A NAME="622"></A>others, formed out of the elements. Let us admit that the soul knows or 
<A NAME="623"></A>perceives the elements out of which each of these composites is made up; 
<A NAME="624"></A>but by what means will it know or perceive the composite whole, e.g. what 
<A NAME="625"></A>God, man, flesh, bone (or any other compound) is? For each is, not merely 
<A NAME="626"></A>the elements of which it is composed, but those elements combined in a 
<A NAME="627"></A>determinate mode or ratio, as Empedocles himself says of 
<A NAME="628"></A>bone,
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>The kindly Earth in its broad-bosomed moulds
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR><B>Won of clear Water two parts out of eight,</B> <B>And four of 
<A NAME="631"></A>Fire; and so white bones were formed.</B>
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR>Nothing, therefore, will be gained by the presence of the elements 
<A NAME="633"></A>in the soul, unless there be also present there the various formulae of 
<A NAME="634"></A>proportion and the various compositions in accordance with them. Each element 
<A NAME="635"></A>will indeed know its fellow outside, but there will be no knowledge of 
<A NAME="636"></A>bone or man, unless they too are present in the constitution of the soul. 
<A NAME="637"></A>The impossibility of this needs no pointing out; for who would suggest 
<A NAME="638"></A>that stone or man could enter into the constitution of the soul? The same 
<A NAME="639"></A>applies to 'the good' and 'the not-good', and so on.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>Further, the word 'is' has many meanings: it may be used of a 'this' 
<A NAME="641"></A>or substance, or of a quantum, or of a quale, or of any other of the kinds 
<A NAME="642"></A>of predicates we have distinguished. Does the soul consist of all of these 
<A NAME="643"></A>or not? It does not appear that all have common elements. Is the soul formed 
<A NAME="644"></A>out of those elements alone which enter into substances? so how will it 
<A NAME="645"></A>be able to know each of the other kinds of thing? Will it be said that 
<A NAME="646"></A>each kind of thing has elements or principles of its own, and that the 
<A NAME="647"></A>soul is formed out of the whole of these? In that case, the soul must be 
<A NAME="648"></A>a quantum and a quale and a substance. But all that can be made out of 
<A NAME="649"></A>the elements of a quantum is a quantum, not a substance. These (and others 
<A NAME="650"></A>like them) are the consequences of the view that the soul is composed of 
<A NAME="651"></A>all the elements.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>It is absurd, also, to say both (a) that like is not capable of 
<A NAME="653"></A>being affected by like, and (b) that like is perceived or known by like, 
<A NAME="654"></A>for perceiving, and also both thinking and knowing, are, on their own assumption, 
<A NAME="655"></A>ways of being affected or moved.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR>There are many puzzles and difficulties raised by saying, as Empedocles 
<A NAME="657"></A>does, that each set of things is known by means of its corporeal elements 
<A NAME="658"></A>and by reference to something in soul which is like them, and additional 
<A NAME="659"></A>testimony is furnished by this new consideration; for all the parts of 
<A NAME="660"></A>the animal body which consist wholly of earth such as bones, sinews, and 
<A NAME="661"></A>hair seem to be wholly insensitive and consequently not perceptive even 
<A NAME="662"></A>of objects earthy like themselves, as they ought to have 
<A NAME="663"></A>been.
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>Further, each of the principles will have far more ignorance than 
<A NAME="665"></A>knowledge, for though each of them will know one thing, there will be many 
<A NAME="666"></A>of which it will be ignorant. Empedocles at any rate must conclude that 
<A NAME="667"></A>his God is the least intelligent of all beings, for of him alone is it 
<A NAME="668"></A>true that there is one thing, Strife, which he does not know, while there 
<A NAME="669"></A>is nothing which mortal beings do not know, for ere is nothing which does 
<A NAME="670"></A>not enter into their composition.
<A NAME="671"></A><BR><BR>In general, we may ask, Why has not everything a soul, since everything 
<A NAME="672"></A>either is an element, or is formed out of one or several or all of the 
<A NAME="673"></A>elements? Each must certainly know one or several or 
<A NAME="674"></A>all.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR>The problem might also be raised, What is that which unifies the 
<A NAME="676"></A>elements into a soul? The elements correspond, it would appear, to the 
<A NAME="677"></A>matter; what unites them, whatever it is, is the supremely important factor. 
<A NAME="678"></A>But it is impossible that there should be something superior to, and dominant 
<A NAME="679"></A>over, the soul (and a fortiori over the mind); it is reasonable to hold 
<A NAME="680"></A>that mind is by nature most primordial and dominant, while their statement 
<A NAME="681"></A>that it is the elements which are first of all that 
<A NAME="682"></A>is.
<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR>All, both those who assert that the soul, because of its knowledge 
<A NAME="684"></A>or perception of what is compounded out of the elements, and is those who 
<A NAME="685"></A>assert that it is of all things the most originative of movement, fail 
<A NAME="686"></A>to take into consideration all kinds of soul. In fact (1) not all beings 
<A NAME="687"></A>that perceive can originate movement; there appear to be certain animals 
<A NAME="688"></A>which stationary, and yet local movement is the only one, so it seems, 
<A NAME="689"></A>which the soul originates in animals. And (2) the same object-on holds 
<A NAME="690"></A>against all those who construct mind and the perceptive faculty out of 
<A NAME="691"></A>the elements; for it appears that plants live, and yet are not endowed 
<A NAME="692"></A>with locomotion or perception, while a large number of animals are without 
<A NAME="693"></A>discourse of reason. Even if these points were waived and mind admitted 
<A NAME="694"></A>to be a part of the soul (and so too the perceptive faculty), still, even 
<A NAME="695"></A>so, there would be kinds and parts of soul of which they had failed to 
<A NAME="696"></A>give any account.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR>The same objection lies against the view expressed in the 'Orphic' 
<A NAME="698"></A>poems: there it is said that the soul comes in from the whole when breathing 
<A NAME="699"></A>takes place, being borne in upon the winds. Now this cannot take place 
<A NAME="700"></A>in the case of plants, nor indeed in the case of certain classes of animal, 
<A NAME="701"></A>for not all classes of animal breathe. This fact has escaped the notice 
<A NAME="702"></A>of the holders of this view.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR>If we must construct the soul out of the elements, there is no 
<A NAME="704"></A>necessity to suppose that all the elements enter into its construction; 
<A NAME="705"></A>one element in each pair of contraries will suffice to enable it to know 
<A NAME="706"></A>both that element itself and its contrary. By means of the straight line 
<A NAME="707"></A>we know both itself and the curved-the carpenter's rule enables us to test 
<A NAME="708"></A>both-but what is curved does not enable us to distinguish either itself 
<A NAME="709"></A>or the straight. Certain thinkers say that soul is intermingled in the 
<A NAME="710"></A>whole universe, and it is perhaps for that reason that Thales came to the 
<A NAME="711"></A>opinion that all things are full of gods. This presents some difficulties: 
<A NAME="712"></A>Why does the soul when it resides in air or fire not form an animal, while 
<A NAME="713"></A>it does so when it resides in mixtures of the elements, and that although 
<A NAME="714"></A>it is held to be of higher quality when contained in the former? (One might 
<A NAME="715"></A>add the question, why the soul in air is maintained to be higher and more 
<A NAME="716"></A>immortal than that in animals.) Both possible ways of replying to the former 
<A NAME="717"></A>question lead to absurdity or paradox; for it is beyond paradox to say 
<A NAME="718"></A>that fire or air is an animal, and it is absurd to refuse the name of animal 
<A NAME="719"></A>to what has soul in it. The opinion that the elements have soul in them 
<A NAME="720"></A>seems to have arisen from the doctrine that a whole must be homogeneous 
<A NAME="721"></A>with its parts. If it is true that animals become animate by drawing into 
<A NAME="722"></A>themselves a portion of what surrounds them, the partisans of this view 
<A NAME="723"></A>are bound to say that the soul of the Whole too is homogeneous with all 
<A NAME="724"></A>its parts. If the air sucked in is homogeneous, but soul heterogeneous, 
<A NAME="725"></A>clearly while some part of soul will exist in the inbreathed air, some 
<A NAME="726"></A>other part will not. The soul must either be homogeneous, or such that 
<A NAME="727"></A>there are some parts of the Whole in which it is not to be 
<A NAME="728"></A>found.
<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>From what has been said it is now clear that knowing as an attribute 
<A NAME="730"></A>of soul cannot be explained by soul's being composed of the elements, and 
<A NAME="731"></A>that it is neither sound nor true to speak of soul as moved. But since 
<A NAME="732"></A>(a) knowing, perceiving, opining, and further (b) desiring, wishing, and 
<A NAME="733"></A>generally all other modes of appetition, belong to soul, and (c) the local 
<A NAME="734"></A>movements of animals, and (d) growth, maturity, and decay are produced 
<A NAME="735"></A>by the soul, we must ask whether each of these is an attribute of the soul 
<A NAME="736"></A>as a whole, i.e. whether it is with the whole soul we think, perceive, 
<A NAME="737"></A>move ourselves, act or are acted upon, or whether each of them requires 
<A NAME="738"></A>a different part of the soul? So too with regard to life. Does it depend 
<A NAME="739"></A>on one of the parts of soul? Or is it dependent on more than one? Or on 
<A NAME="740"></A>all? Or has it some quite other cause?
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR>Some hold that the soul is divisible, and that one part thinks, 
<A NAME="742"></A>another desires. If, then, its nature admits of its being divided, what 
<A NAME="743"></A>can it be that holds the parts together? Surely not the body; on the contrary 
<A NAME="744"></A>it seems rather to be the soul that holds the body together; at any rate 
<A NAME="745"></A>when the soul departs the body disintegrates and decays. If, then, there 
<A NAME="746"></A>is something else which makes the soul one, this unifying agency would 
<A NAME="747"></A>have the best right to the name of soul, and we shall have to repeat for 
<A NAME="748"></A>it the question: Is it one or multipartite? If it is one, why not at once 
<A NAME="749"></A>admit that 'the soul' is one? If it has parts, once more the question must 
<A NAME="750"></A>be put: What holds its parts together, and so ad infinitum?
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR>The question might also be raised about the parts of the soul: 
<A NAME="752"></A>What is the separate role of each in relation to the body? For, if the 
<A NAME="753"></A>whole soul holds together the whole body, we should expect each part of 
<A NAME="754"></A>the soul to hold together a part of the body. But this seems an impossibility; 
<A NAME="755"></A>it is difficult even to imagine what sort of bodily part mind will hold 
<A NAME="756"></A>together, or how it will do this.
<A NAME="757"></A><BR><BR>It is a fact of observation that plants and certain insects go 
<A NAME="758"></A>on living when divided into segments; this means that each of the segments 
<A NAME="759"></A>has a soul in it identical in species, though not numerically identical 
<A NAME="760"></A>in the different segments, for both of the segments for a time possess 
<A NAME="761"></A>the power of sensation and local movement. That this does not last is not 
<A NAME="762"></A>surprising, for they no longer possess the organs necessary for self-maintenance. 
<A NAME="763"></A>But, all the same, in each of the bodily parts there are present all the 
<A NAME="764"></A>parts of soul, and the souls so present are homogeneous with one another 
<A NAME="765"></A>and with the whole; this means that the several parts of the soul are indisseverable 
<A NAME="766"></A>from one another, although the whole soul is divisible. It seems also that 
<A NAME="767"></A>the principle found in plants is also a kind of soul; for this is the only 
<A NAME="768"></A>principle which is common to both animals and plants; and this exists in 
<A NAME="769"></A>isolation from the principle of sensation, though there nothing which has 
<A NAME="770"></A>the latter without the former.
