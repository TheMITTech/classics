<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part I</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>He who would duly inquire about the best form of a state ought first to 
<A NAME="12"></A>determine which is the most eligible life; while this remains uncertain 
<A NAME="13"></A>the best form of the state must also be uncertain; for, in the natural 
<A NAME="14"></A>order of things, those may be expected to lead the best life who are governed 
<A NAME="15"></A>in the best manner of which their circumstances admit. We ought therefore 
<A NAME="16"></A>to ascertain, first of all, which is the most generally eligible life, 
<A NAME="17"></A>and then whether the same life is or is not best for the state and for 
<A NAME="18"></A>individuals.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>Assuming that enough has been already said in discussions outside 
<A NAME="20"></A>the school concerning the best life, we will now only repeat what is contained 
<A NAME="21"></A>in them. Certainly no one will dispute the propriety of that partition 
<A NAME="22"></A>of goods which separates them into three classes, viz., external goods, 
<A NAME="23"></A>goods of the body, and goods of the soul, or deny that the happy man must 
<A NAME="24"></A>have all three. For no one would maintain that he is happy who has not 
<A NAME="25"></A>in him a particle of courage or temperance or justice or prudence, who 
<A NAME="26"></A>is afraid of every insect which flutters past him, and will commit any 
<A NAME="27"></A>crime, however great, in order to gratify his lust of meat or drink, who 
<A NAME="28"></A>will sacrifice his dearest friend for the sake of half-a-farthing, and 
<A NAME="29"></A>is as feeble and false in mind as a child or a madman. These propositions 
<A NAME="30"></A>are almost universally acknowledged as soon as they are uttered, but men 
<A NAME="31"></A>differ about the degree or relative superiority of this or that good. Some 
<A NAME="32"></A>think that a very moderate amount of virtue is enough, but set no limit 
<A NAME="33"></A>to their desires of wealth, property, power, reputation, and the like. 
<A NAME="34"></A>To whom we reply by an appeal to facts, which easily prove that mankind 
<A NAME="35"></A>do not acquire or preserve virtue by the help of external goods, but external 
<A NAME="36"></A>goods by the help of virtue, and that happiness, whether consisting in 
<A NAME="37"></A>pleasure or virtue, or both, is more often found with those who are most 
<A NAME="38"></A>highly cultivated in their mind and in their character, and have only a 
<A NAME="39"></A>moderate share of external goods, than among those who possess external 
<A NAME="40"></A>goods to a useless extent but are deficient in higher qualities; and this 
<A NAME="41"></A>is not only matter of experience, but, if reflected upon, will easily appear 
<A NAME="42"></A>to be in accordance with reason. For, whereas external goods have a limit, 
<A NAME="43"></A>like any other instrument, and all things useful are of such a nature that 
<A NAME="44"></A>where there is too much of them they must either do harm, or at any rate 
<A NAME="45"></A>be of no use, to their possessors, every good of the soul, the greater 
<A NAME="46"></A>it is, is also of greater use, if the epithet useful as well as noble is 
<A NAME="47"></A>appropriate to such subjects. No proof is required to show that the best 
<A NAME="48"></A>state of one thing in relation to another corresponds in degree of excellence 
<A NAME="49"></A>to the interval between the natures of which we say that these very states 
<A NAME="50"></A>are states: so that, if the soul is more noble than our possessions or 
<A NAME="51"></A>our bodies, both absolutely and in relation to us, it must be admitted 
<A NAME="52"></A>that the best state of either has a similar ratio to the other. Again, 
<A NAME="53"></A>it is for the sake of the soul that goods external and goods of the body 
<A NAME="54"></A>are eligible at all, and all wise men ought to choose them for the sake 
<A NAME="55"></A>of the soul, and not the soul for the sake of them.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>Let us acknowledge then that each one has just so much of happiness 
<A NAME="57"></A>as he has of virtue and wisdom, and of virtuous and wise action. God is 
<A NAME="58"></A>a witness to us of this truth, for he is happy and blessed, not by reason 
<A NAME="59"></A>of any external good, but in himself and by reason of his own nature. And 
<A NAME="60"></A>herein of necessity lies the difference between good fortune and happiness; 
<A NAME="61"></A>for external goods come of themselves, and chance is the author of them, 
<A NAME="62"></A>but no one is just or temperate by or through chance. In like manner, and 
<A NAME="63"></A>by a similar train of argument, the happy state may be shown to be that 
<A NAME="64"></A>which is best and which acts rightly; and rightly it cannot act without 
<A NAME="65"></A>doing right actions, and neither individual nor state can do right actions 
<A NAME="66"></A>without virtue and wisdom. Thus the courage, justice, and wisdom of a state 
<A NAME="67"></A>have the same form and nature as the qualities which give the individual 
<A NAME="68"></A>who possesses them the name of just, wise, or temperate.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>Thus much may suffice by way of preface: for I could not avoid 
<A NAME="70"></A>touching upon these questions, neither could I go through all the arguments 
<A NAME="71"></A>affecting them; these are the business of another science.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>Let us assume then that the best life, both for individuals and 
<A NAME="73"></A>states, is the life of virtue, when virtue has external goods enough for 
<A NAME="74"></A>the performance of good actions. If there are any who controvert our assertion, 
<A NAME="75"></A>we will in this treatise pass them over, and consider their objections 
<A NAME="76"></A>hereafter.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="77"></A><B>Part II</B>

<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>There remains to be discussed the question whether the happiness 
<A NAME="79"></A>of the individual is the same as that of the state, or different. Here 
<A NAME="80"></A>again there can be no doubt- no one denies that they are the same. For 
<A NAME="81"></A>those who hold that the well-being of the individual consists in his wealth, 
<A NAME="82"></A>also think that riches make the happiness of the whole state, and those 
<A NAME="83"></A>who value most highly the life of a tyrant deem that city the happiest 
<A NAME="84"></A>which rules over the greatest number; while they who approve an individual 
<A NAME="85"></A>for his virtue say that the more virtuous a city is, the happier it is. 
<A NAME="86"></A>Two points here present themselves for consideration: first (1), which 
<A NAME="87"></A>is the more eligible life, that of a citizen who is a member of a state, 
<A NAME="88"></A>or that of an alien who has no political ties; and again (2), which is 
<A NAME="89"></A>the best form of constitution or the best condition of a state, either 
<A NAME="90"></A>on the supposition that political privileges are desirable for all, or 
<A NAME="91"></A>for a majority only? Since the good of the state and not of the individual 
<A NAME="92"></A>is the proper subject of political thought and speculation, and we are 
<A NAME="93"></A>engaged in a political discussion, while the first of these two points 
<A NAME="94"></A>has a secondary interest for us, the latter will be the main subject of 
<A NAME="95"></A>our inquiry.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>Now it is evident that the form of government is best in which 
<A NAME="97"></A>every man, whoever he is, can act best and live happily. But even those 
<A NAME="98"></A>who agree in thinking that the life of virtue is the most eligible raise 
<A NAME="99"></A>a question, whether the life of business and politics is or is not more 
<A NAME="100"></A>eligible than one which is wholly independent of external goods, I mean 
<A NAME="101"></A>than a contemplative life, which by some is maintained to be the only one 
<A NAME="102"></A>worthy of a philosopher. For these two lives- the life of the philosopher 
<A NAME="103"></A>and the life of the statesman- appear to have been preferred by those who 
<A NAME="104"></A>have been most keen in the pursuit of virtue, both in our own and in other 
<A NAME="105"></A>ages. Which is the better is a question of no small moment; for the wise 
<A NAME="106"></A>man, like the wise state, will necessarily regulate his life according 
<A NAME="107"></A>to the best end. There are some who think that while a despotic rule over 
<A NAME="108"></A>others is the greatest injustice, to exercise a constitutional rule over 
<A NAME="109"></A>them, even though not unjust, is a great impediment to a man's individual 
<A NAME="110"></A>wellbeing. Others take an opposite view; they maintain that the true life 
<A NAME="111"></A>of man is the practical and political, and that every virtue admits of 
<A NAME="112"></A>being practiced, quite as much by statesmen and rulers as by private individuals. 
<A NAME="113"></A>Others, again, are of opinion that arbitrary and tyrannical rule alone 
<A NAME="114"></A>consists with happiness; indeed, in some states the entire aim both of 
<A NAME="115"></A>the laws and of the constitution is to give men despotic power over their 
<A NAME="116"></A>neighbors. And, therefore, although in most cities the laws may be said 
<A NAME="117"></A>generally to be in a chaotic state, still, if they aim at anything, they 
<A NAME="118"></A>aim at the maintenance of power: thus in Lacedaemon and Crete the system 
<A NAME="119"></A>of education and the greater part of the of the laws are framed with a 
<A NAME="120"></A>view to war. And in all nations which are able to gratify their ambition 
<A NAME="121"></A>military power is held in esteem, for example among the Scythians and Persians 
<A NAME="122"></A>and Thracians and Celts.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>In some nations there are even laws tending to stimulate the warlike 
<A NAME="124"></A>virtues, as at Carthage, where we are told that men obtain the honor of 
<A NAME="125"></A>wearing as many armlets as they have served campaigns. There was once a 
<A NAME="126"></A>law in Macedonia that he who had not killed an enemy should wear a halter, 
<A NAME="127"></A>and among the Scythians no one who had not slain his man was allowed to 
<A NAME="128"></A>drink out of the cup which was handed round at a certain feast. Among the 
<A NAME="129"></A>Iberians, a warlike nation, the number of enemies whom a man has slain 
<A NAME="130"></A>is indicated by the number of obelisks which are fixed in the earth round 
<A NAME="131"></A>his tomb; and there are numerous practices among other nations of a like 
<A NAME="132"></A>kind, some of them established by law and others by custom. Yet to a reflecting 
<A NAME="133"></A>mind it must appear very strange that the statesman should be always considering 
<A NAME="134"></A>how he can dominate and tyrannize over others, whether they will or not. 
<A NAME="135"></A>How can that which is not even lawful be the business of the statesman 
<A NAME="136"></A>or the legislator? Unlawful it certainly is to rule without regard to justice, 
<A NAME="137"></A>for there may be might where there is no right. The other arts and sciences 
<A NAME="138"></A>offer no parallel a physician is not expected to persuade or coerce his 
<A NAME="139"></A>patients, nor a pilot the passengers in his ship. Yet most men appear to 
<A NAME="140"></A>think that the art of despotic government is statesmanship, and what men 
<A NAME="141"></A>affirm to be unjust and inexpedient in their own case they are not ashamed 
<A NAME="142"></A>of practicing towards others; they demand just rule for themselves, but 
<A NAME="143"></A>where other men are concerned they care nothing about it. Such behavior 
<A NAME="144"></A>is irrational; unless the one party is, and the other is not, born to serve, 
<A NAME="145"></A>in which case men have a right to command, not indeed all their fellows, 
<A NAME="146"></A>but only those who are intended to be subjects; just as we ought not to 
<A NAME="147"></A>hunt mankind, whether for food or sacrifice, but only the animals which 
<A NAME="148"></A>may be hunted for food or sacrifice, this is to say, such wild animals 
<A NAME="149"></A>as are eatable. And surely there may be a city happy in isolation, which 
<A NAME="150"></A>we will assume to be well-governed (for it is quite possible that a city 
<A NAME="151"></A>thus isolated might be well-administered and have good laws); but such 
<A NAME="152"></A>a city would not be constituted with any view to war or the conquest of 
<A NAME="153"></A>enemies- all that sort of thing must be excluded. Hence we see very plainly 
<A NAME="154"></A>that warlike pursuits, although generally to be deemed honorable, are not 
<A NAME="155"></A>the supreme end of all things, but only means. And the good lawgiver should 
<A NAME="156"></A>inquire how states and races of men and communities may participate in 
<A NAME="157"></A>a good life, and in the happiness which is attainable by them. His enactments 
<A NAME="158"></A>will not be always the same; and where there are neighbors he will have 
<A NAME="159"></A>to see what sort of studies should be practiced in relation to their several 
<A NAME="160"></A>characters, or how the measures appropriate in relation to each are to 
<A NAME="161"></A>be adopted. The end at which the best form of government should aim may 
<A NAME="162"></A>be properly made a matter of future consideration.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="163"></A><B>Part III</B>

<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>Let us now address those who, while they agree that the life of 
<A NAME="165"></A>virtue is the most eligible, differ about the manner of practicing it. 
<A NAME="166"></A>For some renounce political power, and think that the life of the freeman 
<A NAME="167"></A>is different from the life of the statesman and the best of all; but others 
<A NAME="168"></A>think the life of the statesman best. The argument of the latter is that 
<A NAME="169"></A>he who does nothing cannot do well, and that virtuous activity is identical 
<A NAME="170"></A>with happiness. To both we say: 'you are partly right and partly wrong.' 
<A NAME="171"></A>first class are right in affirming that the life of the freeman is better 
<A NAME="172"></A>than the life of the despot; for there is nothing grand or noble in having 
<A NAME="173"></A>the use of a slave, in so far as he is a slave; or in issuing commands 
<A NAME="174"></A>about necessary things. But it is an error to suppose that every sort of 
<A NAME="175"></A>rule is despotic like that of a master over slaves, for there is as great 
<A NAME="176"></A>a difference between the rule over freemen and the rule over slaves as 
<A NAME="177"></A>there is between slavery by nature and freedom by nature, about which I 
<A NAME="178"></A>have said enough at the commencement of this treatise. And it is equally 
<A NAME="179"></A>a mistake to place inactivity above action, for happiness is activity, 
<A NAME="180"></A>and the actions of the just and wise are the realization of much that is 
<A NAME="181"></A>noble.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>But perhaps some one, accepting these premises, may still maintain 
<A NAME="183"></A>that supreme power is the best of all things, because the possessors of 
<A NAME="184"></A>it are able to perform the greatest number of noble actions. if so, the 
<A NAME="185"></A>man who is able to rule, instead of giving up anything to his neighbor, 
<A NAME="186"></A>ought rather to take away his power; and the father should make no account 
<A NAME="187"></A>of his son, nor the son of his father, nor friend of friend; they should 
<A NAME="188"></A>not bestow a thought on one another in comparison with this higher object, 
<A NAME="189"></A>for the best is the most eligible and 'doing eligible' and 'doing well' 
<A NAME="190"></A>is the best. There might be some truth in such a view if we assume that 
<A NAME="191"></A>robbers and plunderers attain the chief good. But this can never be; their 
<A NAME="192"></A>hypothesis is false. For the actions of a ruler cannot really be honorable, 
<A NAME="193"></A>unless he is as much superior to other men as a husband is to a wife, or 
<A NAME="194"></A>a father to his children, or a master to his slaves. And therefore he who 
<A NAME="195"></A>violates the law can never recover by any success, however great, what 
<A NAME="196"></A>he has already lost in departing from virtue. For equals the honorable 
<A NAME="197"></A>and the just consist in sharing alike, as is just and equal. But that the 
<A NAME="198"></A>unequal should be given to equals, and the unlike to those who are like, 
<A NAME="199"></A>is contrary to nature, and nothing which is contrary to nature is good. 
<A NAME="200"></A>If, therefore, there is any one superior in virtue and in the power of 
<A NAME="201"></A>performing the best actions, him we ought to follow and obey, but he must 
<A NAME="202"></A>have the capacity for action as well as virtue.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>If we are right in our view, and happiness is assumed to be virtuous 
<A NAME="204"></A>activity, the active life will be the best, both for every city collectively, 
<A NAME="205"></A>and for individuals. Not that a life of action must necessarily have relation 
<A NAME="206"></A>to others, as some persons think, nor are those ideas only to be regarded 
<A NAME="207"></A>as practical which are pursued for the sake of practical results, but much 
<A NAME="208"></A>more the thoughts and contemplations which are independent and complete 
<A NAME="209"></A>in themselves; since virtuous activity, and therefore a certain kind of 
<A NAME="210"></A>action, is an end, and even in the case of external actions the directing 
<A NAME="211"></A>mind is most truly said to act. Neither, again, is it necessary that states 
<A NAME="212"></A>which are cut off from others and choose to live alone should be inactive; 
<A NAME="213"></A>for activity, as well as other things, may take place by sections; there 
<A NAME="214"></A>are many ways in which the sections of a state act upon one another. The 
<A NAME="215"></A>same thing is equally true of every individual. If this were otherwise, 
<A NAME="216"></A>God and the universe, who have no external actions over and above their 
<A NAME="217"></A>own energies, would be far enough from perfection. Hence it is evident 
<A NAME="218"></A>that the same life is best for each individual, and for states and for 
<A NAME="219"></A>mankind collectively
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="220"></A><B>Part IV</B>

<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>Thus far by way of introduction. In what has preceded I have discussed 
<A NAME="222"></A>other forms of government; in what remains the first point to be considered 
<A NAME="223"></A>is what should be the conditions of the ideal or perfect state; for the 
<A NAME="224"></A>perfect state cannot exist without a due supply of the means of life. And 
<A NAME="225"></A>therefore we must presuppose many purely imaginary conditions, but nothing 
<A NAME="226"></A>impossible. There will be a certain number of citizens, a country in which 
<A NAME="227"></A>to place them, and the like. As the weaver or shipbuilder or any other 
<A NAME="228"></A>artisan must have the material proper for his work (and in proportion as 
<A NAME="229"></A>this is better prepared, so will the result of his art be nobler), so the 
<A NAME="230"></A>statesman or legislator must also have the materials suited to 
<A NAME="231"></A>him.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>First among the materials required by the statesman is population: 
<A NAME="233"></A>he will consider what should be the number and character of the citizens, 
<A NAME="234"></A>and then what should be the size and character of the country. Most persons 
<A NAME="235"></A>think that a state in order to be happy ought to be large; but even if 
<A NAME="236"></A>they are right, they have no idea what is a large and what a small state. 
<A NAME="237"></A>For they judge of the size of the city by the number of the inhabitants; 
<A NAME="238"></A>whereas they ought to regard, not their number, but their power. A city 
<A NAME="239"></A>too, like an individual, has a work to do; and that city which is best 
<A NAME="240"></A>adapted to the fulfillment of its work is to be deemed greatest, in the 
<A NAME="241"></A>same sense of the word great in which Hippocrates might be called greater, 
<A NAME="242"></A>not as a man, but as a physician, than some one else who was taller And 
<A NAME="243"></A>even if we reckon greatness by numbers, we ought not to include everybody, 
<A NAME="244"></A>for there must always be in cities a multitude of slaves and sojourners 
<A NAME="245"></A>and foreigners; but we should include those only who are members of the 
<A NAME="246"></A>state, and who form an essential part of it. The number of the latter is 
<A NAME="247"></A>a proof of the greatness of a city; but a city which produces numerous 
<A NAME="248"></A>artisans and comparatively few soldiers cannot be great, for a great city 
<A NAME="249"></A>is not to be confounded with a populous one. Moreover, experience shows 
<A NAME="250"></A>that a very populous city can rarely, if ever, be well governed; since 
<A NAME="251"></A>all cities which have a reputation for good government have a limit of 
<A NAME="252"></A>population. We may argue on grounds of reason, and the same result will 
<A NAME="253"></A>follow. For law is order, and good law is good order; but a very great 
<A NAME="254"></A>multitude cannot be orderly: to introduce order into the unlimited is the 
<A NAME="255"></A>work of a divine power- of such a power as holds together the universe. 
<A NAME="256"></A>Beauty is realized in number and magnitude, and the state which combines 
<A NAME="257"></A>magnitude with good order must necessarily be the most beautiful. To the 
<A NAME="258"></A>size of states there is a limit, as there is to other things, plants, animals, 
<A NAME="259"></A>implements; for none of these retain their natural power when they are 
<A NAME="260"></A>too large or too small, but they either wholly lose their nature, or are 
<A NAME="261"></A>spoiled. For example, a ship which is only a span long will not be a ship 
<A NAME="262"></A>at all, nor a ship a quarter of a mile long; yet there may be a ship of 
<A NAME="263"></A>a certain size, either too large or too small, which will still be a ship, 
<A NAME="264"></A>but bad for sailing. In like manner a state when composed of too few is 
<A NAME="265"></A>not, as a state ought to be, self-sufficing; when of too many, though self-sufficing 
<A NAME="266"></A>in all mere necessaries, as a nation may be, it is not a state, being almost 
<A NAME="267"></A>incapable of constitutional government. For who can be the general of such 
<A NAME="268"></A>a vast multitude, or who the herald, unless he have the voice of a 
<A NAME="269"></A>Stentor?
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>A state, then, only begins to exist when it has attained a population 
<A NAME="271"></A>sufficient for a good life in the political community: it may indeed, if 
<A NAME="272"></A>it somewhat exceed this number, be a greater state. But, as I was saying, 
<A NAME="273"></A>there must be a limit. What should be the limit will be easily ascertained 
<A NAME="274"></A>by experience. For both governors and governed have duties to perform; 
<A NAME="275"></A>the special functions of a governor to command and to judge. But if the 
<A NAME="276"></A>citizens of a state are to judge and to distribute offices according to 
<A NAME="277"></A>merit, then they must know each other's characters; where they do not possess 
<A NAME="278"></A>this knowledge, both the election to offices and the decision of lawsuits 
<A NAME="279"></A>will go wrong. When the population is very large they are manifestly settled 
<A NAME="280"></A>at haphazard, which clearly ought not to be. Besides, in an over-populous 
<A NAME="281"></A>state foreigners and metics will readily acquire the rights of citizens, 
<A NAME="282"></A>for who will find them out? Clearly then the best limit of the population 
<A NAME="283"></A>of a state is the largest number which suffices for the purposes of life, 
<A NAME="284"></A>and can be taken in at a single view. Enough concerning the size of a 
<A NAME="285"></A>state.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="286"></A><B>Part V</B>

<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>Much the same principle will apply to the territory of the state: 
<A NAME="288"></A>every one would agree in praising the territory which is most entirely 
<A NAME="289"></A>self-sufficing; and that must be the territory which is all-producing, 
<A NAME="290"></A>for to have all things and to want nothing is sufficiency. In size and 
<A NAME="291"></A>extent it should be such as may enable the inhabitants to live at once 
<A NAME="292"></A>temperately and liberally in the enjoyment of leisure. Whether we are right 
<A NAME="293"></A>or wrong in laying down this limit we will inquire more precisely hereafter, 
<A NAME="294"></A>when we have occasion to consider what is the right use of property and 
<A NAME="295"></A>wealth: a matter which is much disputed, because men are inclined to rush 
<A NAME="296"></A>into one of two extremes, some into meanness, others into 
<A NAME="297"></A>luxury.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>It is not difficult to determine the general character of the territory 
<A NAME="299"></A>which is required (there are, however, some points on which military authorities 
<A NAME="300"></A>should be heard); it should be difficult of access to the enemy, and easy 
<A NAME="301"></A>of egress to the inhabitants. Further, we require that the land as well 
<A NAME="302"></A>as the inhabitants of whom we were just now speaking should be taken in 
<A NAME="303"></A>at a single view, for a country which is easily seen can be easily protected. 
<A NAME="304"></A>As to the position of the city, if we could have what we wish, it should 
<A NAME="305"></A>be well situated in regard both to sea and land. This then is one principle, 
<A NAME="306"></A>that it should be a convenient center for the protection of the whole country: 
<A NAME="307"></A>the other is, that it should be suitable for receiving the fruits of the 
<A NAME="308"></A>soil, and also for the bringing in of timber and any other products that 
<A NAME="309"></A>are easily transported.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="310"></A><B>Part VI</B>

<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>Whether a communication with the sea is beneficial to a well-ordered 
<A NAME="312"></A>state or not is a question which has often been asked. It is argued that 
<A NAME="313"></A>the introduction of strangers brought up under other laws, and the increase 
<A NAME="314"></A>of population, will be adverse to good order; the increase arises from 
<A NAME="315"></A>their using the sea and having a crowd of merchants coming and going, and 
<A NAME="316"></A>is inimical to good government. Apart from these considerations, it would 
<A NAME="317"></A>be undoubtedly better, both with a view to safety and to the provision 
<A NAME="318"></A>of necessaries, that the city and territory should be connected with the 
<A NAME="319"></A>sea; the defenders of a country, if they are to maintain themselves against 
<A NAME="320"></A>an enemy, should be easily relieved both by land and by sea; and even if 
<A NAME="321"></A>they are not able to attack by sea and land at once, they will have less 
<A NAME="322"></A>difficulty in doing mischief to their assailants on one element, if they 
<A NAME="323"></A>themselves can use both. Moreover, it is necessary that they should import 
<A NAME="324"></A>from abroad what is not found in their own country, and that they should 
<A NAME="325"></A>export what they have in excess; for a city ought to be a market, not indeed 
<A NAME="326"></A>for others, but for herself.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>Those who make themselves a market for the world only do so for 
<A NAME="328"></A>the sake of revenue, and if a state ought not to desire profit of this 
<A NAME="329"></A>kind it ought not to have such an emporium. Nowadays we often see in countries 
<A NAME="330"></A>and cities dockyards and harbors very conveniently placed outside the city, 
<A NAME="331"></A>but not too far off; and they are kept in dependence by walls and similar 
<A NAME="332"></A>fortifications. Cities thus situated manifestly reap the benefit of intercourse 
<A NAME="333"></A>with their ports; and any harm which is likely to accrue may be easily 
<A NAME="334"></A>guarded against by the laws, which will pronounce and determine who may 
<A NAME="335"></A>hold communication with one another, and who may not.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>There can be no doubt that the possession of a moderate naval force 
<A NAME="337"></A>is advantageous to a city; the city should be formidable not only to its 
<A NAME="338"></A>own citizens but to some of its neighbors, or, if necessary, able to assist 
<A NAME="339"></A>them by sea as well as by land. The proper number or magnitude of this 
<A NAME="340"></A>naval force is relative to the character of the state; for if her function 
<A NAME="341"></A>is to take a leading part in politics, her naval power should be commensurate 
<A NAME="342"></A>with the scale of her enterprises. The population of the state need not 
<A NAME="343"></A>be much increased, since there is no necessity that the sailors should 
<A NAME="344"></A>be citizens: the marines who have the control and command will be freemen, 
<A NAME="345"></A>and belong also to the infantry; and wherever there is a dense population 
<A NAME="346"></A>of Perioeci and husbandmen, there will always be sailors more than enough. 
<A NAME="347"></A>Of this we see instances at the present day. The city of Heraclea, for 
<A NAME="348"></A>example, although small in comparison with many others, can man a considerable 
<A NAME="349"></A>fleet. Such are our conclusions respecting the territory of the state, 
<A NAME="350"></A>its harbors, its towns, its relations to the sea, and its maritime 
<A NAME="351"></A>power.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="352"></A><B>Part VII</B>

<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>Having spoken of the number of the citizens, we will proceed to 
<A NAME="354"></A>speak of what should be their character. This is a subject which can be 
<A NAME="355"></A>easily understood by any one who casts his eye on the more celebrated states 
<A NAME="356"></A>of Hellas, and generally on the distribution of races in the habitable 
<A NAME="357"></A>world. Those who live in a cold climate and in Europe are full of spirit, 
<A NAME="358"></A>but wanting in intelligence and skill; and therefore they retain comparative 
<A NAME="359"></A>freedom, but have no political organization, and are incapable of ruling 
<A NAME="360"></A>over others. Whereas the natives of Asia are intelligent and inventive, 
<A NAME="361"></A>but they are wanting in spirit, and therefore they are always in a state 
<A NAME="362"></A>of subjection and slavery. But the Hellenic race, which is situated between 
<A NAME="363"></A>them, is likewise intermediate in character, being high-spirited and also 
<A NAME="364"></A>intelligent. Hence it continues free, and is the best-governed of any nation, 
<A NAME="365"></A>and, if it could be formed into one state, would be able to rule the world. 
<A NAME="366"></A>There are also similar differences in the different tribes of Hellas; for 
<A NAME="367"></A>some of them are of a one-sided nature, and are intelligent or courageous 
<A NAME="368"></A>only, while in others there is a happy combination of both qualities. And 
<A NAME="369"></A>clearly those whom the legislator will most easily lead to virtue may be 
<A NAME="370"></A>expected to be both intelligent and courageous. Some say that the guardians 
<A NAME="371"></A>should be friendly towards those whom they know, fierce towards those whom 
<A NAME="372"></A>they do not know. Now, passion is the quality of the soul which begets 
<A NAME="373"></A>friendship and enables us to love; notably the spirit within us is more 
<A NAME="374"></A>stirred against our friends and acquaintances than against those who are 
<A NAME="375"></A>unknown to us, when we think that we are despised by them; for which reason 
<A NAME="376"></A>Archilochus, complaining of his friends, very naturally addresses his soul 
<A NAME="377"></A>in these words: <BR><BR>"For surely thou art plagued on account of friends. 
<A NAME="378"></A>"<BR><BR>

<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>The power of command and the love of freedom are in all men based 
<A NAME="380"></A>upon this quality, for passion is commanding and invincible. Nor is it 
<A NAME="381"></A>right to say that the guardians should be fierce towards those whom they 
<A NAME="382"></A>do not know, for we ought not to be out of temper with any one; and a lofty 
<A NAME="383"></A>spirit is not fierce by nature, but only when excited against evil-doers. 
<A NAME="384"></A>And this, as I was saying before, is a feeling which men show most strongly 
<A NAME="385"></A>towards their friends if they think they have received a wrong at their 
<A NAME="386"></A>hands: as indeed is reasonable; for, besides the actual injury, they seem 
<A NAME="387"></A>to be deprived of a benefit by those who owe them one. Hence the saying: 
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR>"Cruel is the strife of brethren, "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="389"></A>and again: <BR><BR>"They who love in excess also hate in excess. 
<A NAME="390"></A>"<BR><BR>

<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>Thus we have nearly determined the number and character of the 
<A NAME="392"></A>citizens of our state, and also the size and nature of their territory. 
<A NAME="393"></A>I say 'nearly,' for we ought not to require the same minuteness in theory 
<A NAME="394"></A>as in the facts given by perception.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="395"></A><B>Part VIII</B>

<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>As in other natural compounds the conditions of a composite whole 
<A NAME="397"></A>are not necessarily organic parts of it, so in a state or in any other 
<A NAME="398"></A>combination forming a unity not everything is a part, which is a necessary 
<A NAME="399"></A>condition. The members of an association have necessarily some one thing 
<A NAME="400"></A>the same and common to all, in which they share equally or unequally for 
<A NAME="401"></A>example, food or land or any other thing. But where there are two things 
<A NAME="402"></A>of which one is a means and the other an end, they have nothing in common 
<A NAME="403"></A>except that the one receives what the other produces. Such, for example, 
<A NAME="404"></A>is the relation which workmen and tools stand to their work; the house 
<A NAME="405"></A>and the builder have nothing in common, but the art of the builder is for 
<A NAME="406"></A>the sake of the house. And so states require property, but property, even 
<A NAME="407"></A>though living beings are included in it, is no part of a state; for a state 
<A NAME="408"></A>is not a community of living beings only, but a community of equals, aiming 
<A NAME="409"></A>at the best life possible. Now, whereas happiness is the highest good, 
<A NAME="410"></A>being a realization and perfect practice of virtue, which some can attain, 
<A NAME="411"></A>while others have little or none of it, the various qualities of men are 
<A NAME="412"></A>clearly the reason why there are various kinds of states and many forms 
<A NAME="413"></A>of government; for different men seek after happiness in different ways 
<A NAME="414"></A>and by different means, and so make for themselves different modes of life 
<A NAME="415"></A>and forms of government. We must see also how many things are indispensable 
<A NAME="416"></A>to the existence of a state, for what we call the parts of a state will 
<A NAME="417"></A>be found among the indispensables. Let us then enumerate the functions 
<A NAME="418"></A>of a state, and we shall easily elicit what we want:
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>First, there must be food; secondly, arts, for life requires many 
<A NAME="420"></A>instruments; thirdly, there must be arms, for the members of a community 
<A NAME="421"></A>have need of them, and in their own hands, too, in order to maintain authority 
<A NAME="422"></A>both against disobedient subjects and against external assailants; fourthly, 
<A NAME="423"></A>there must be a certain amount of revenue, both for internal needs, and 
<A NAME="424"></A>for the purposes of war; fifthly, or rather first, there must be a care 
<A NAME="425"></A>of religion which is commonly called worship; sixthly, and most necessary 
<A NAME="426"></A>of all there must be a power of deciding what is for the public interest, 
<A NAME="427"></A>and what is just in men's dealings with one another.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>These are the services which every state may be said to need. For 
<A NAME="429"></A>a state is not a mere aggregate of persons, but a union of them sufficing 
<A NAME="430"></A>for the purposes of life; and if any of these things be wanting, it is 
<A NAME="431"></A>as we maintain impossible that the community can be absolutely self-sufficing. 
<A NAME="432"></A>A state then should be framed with a view to the fulfillment of these functions. 
<A NAME="433"></A>There must be husbandmen to procure food, and artisans, and a warlike and 
<A NAME="434"></A>a wealthy class, and priests, and judges to decide what is necessary and 
<A NAME="435"></A>expedient.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="436"></A><B>Part IX</B>

<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>Having determined these points, we have in the next place to consider 
<A NAME="438"></A>whether all ought to share in every sort of occupation. Shall every man 
<A NAME="439"></A>be at once husbandman, artisan, councillor, judge, or shall we suppose 
<A NAME="440"></A>the several occupations just mentioned assigned to different persons? or, 
<A NAME="441"></A>thirdly, shall some employments be assigned to individuals and others common 
<A NAME="442"></A>to all? The same arrangement, however, does not occur in every constitution; 
<A NAME="443"></A>as we were saying, all may be shared by all, or not all by all, but only 
<A NAME="444"></A>by some; and hence arise the differences of constitutions, for in democracies 
<A NAME="445"></A>all share in all, in oligarchies the opposite practice prevails. Now, since 
<A NAME="446"></A>we are here speaking of the best form of government, i.e., that under which 
<A NAME="447"></A>the state will be most happy (and happiness, as has been already said, 
<A NAME="448"></A>cannot exist without virtue), it clearly follows that in the state which 
<A NAME="449"></A>is best governed and possesses men who are just absolutely, and not merely 
<A NAME="450"></A>relatively to the principle of the constitution, the citizens must not 
<A NAME="451"></A>lead the life of mechanics or tradesmen, for such a life is ignoble, and 
<A NAME="452"></A>inimical to virtue. Neither must they be husbandmen, since leisure is necessary 
<A NAME="453"></A>both for the development of virtue and the performance of political 
<A NAME="454"></A>duties.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>Again, there is in a state a class of warriors, and another of 
<A NAME="456"></A>councillors, who advise about the expedient and determine matters of law, 
<A NAME="457"></A>and these seem in an especial manner parts of a state. Now, should these 
<A NAME="458"></A>two classes be distinguished, or are both functions to be assigned to the 
<A NAME="459"></A>same persons? Here again there is no difficulty in seeing that both functions 
<A NAME="460"></A>will in one way belong to the same, in another, to different persons. To 
<A NAME="461"></A>different persons in so far as these i.e., the physical and the employments 
<A NAME="462"></A>are suited to different primes of life, for the one requires mental wisdom 
<A NAME="463"></A>and the other strength. But on the other hand, since it is an impossible 
<A NAME="464"></A>thing that those who are able to use or to resist force should be willing 
<A NAME="465"></A>to remain always in subjection, from this point of view the persons are 
<A NAME="466"></A>the same; for those who carry arms can always determine the fate of the 
<A NAME="467"></A>constitution. It remains therefore that both functions should be entrusted 
<A NAME="468"></A>by the ideal constitution to the same persons, not, however, at the same 
<A NAME="469"></A>time, but in the order prescribed by nature, who has given to young men 
<A NAME="470"></A>strength and to older men wisdom. Such a distribution of duties will be 
<A NAME="471"></A>expedient and also just, and is founded upon a principle of conformity 
<A NAME="472"></A>to merit. Besides, the ruling class should be the owners of property, for 
<A NAME="473"></A>they are citizens, and the citizens of a state should be in good circumstances; 
<A NAME="474"></A>whereas mechanics or any other class which is not a producer of virtue 
<A NAME="475"></A>have no share in the state. This follows from our first principle, for 
<A NAME="476"></A>happiness cannot exist without virtue, and a city is not to be termed happy 
<A NAME="477"></A>in regard to a portion of the citizens, but in regard to them all. And 
<A NAME="478"></A>clearly property should be in their hands, since the husbandmen will of 
<A NAME="479"></A>necessity be slaves or barbarian Perioeci.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR>Of the classes enumerated there remain only the priests, and the 
<A NAME="481"></A>manner in which their office is to be regulated is obvious. No husbandman 
<A NAME="482"></A>or mechanic should be appointed to it; for the Gods should receive honor 
<A NAME="483"></A>from the citizens only. Now since the body of the citizen is divided into 
<A NAME="484"></A>two classes, the warriors and the councillors and it is beseeming that 
<A NAME="485"></A>the worship of the Gods should be duly performed, and also a rest provided 
<A NAME="486"></A>in their service for those who from age have given up active life, to the 
<A NAME="487"></A>old men of these two classes should be assigned the duties of the 
<A NAME="488"></A>priesthood.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR>We have shown what are the necessary conditions, and what the parts 
<A NAME="490"></A>of a state: husbandmen, craftsmen, and laborers of an kinds are necessary 
<A NAME="491"></A>to the existence of states, but the parts of the state are the warriors 
<A NAME="492"></A>and councillors. And these are distinguished severally from one another, 
<A NAME="493"></A>the distinction being in some cases permanent, in others 
<A NAME="494"></A>not.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="495"></A><B>Part X</B>

<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>It is not a new or recent discovery of political philosophers that 
<A NAME="497"></A>the state ought to be divided into classes, and that the warriors should 
<A NAME="498"></A>be separated from the husbandmen. The system has continued in Egypt and 
<A NAME="499"></A>in Crete to this day, and was established, as tradition says, by a law 
<A NAME="500"></A>of Sesostris in Egypt and of Minos in Crete. The institution of common 
<A NAME="501"></A>tables also appears to be of ancient date, being in Crete as old as the 
<A NAME="502"></A>reign of Minos, and in Italy far older. The Italian historians say that 
<A NAME="503"></A>there was a certain Italus, king of Oenotria, from whom the Oenotrians 
<A NAME="504"></A>were called Italians, and who gave the name of Italy to the promontory 
<A NAME="505"></A>of Europe lying within the Scylletic and Lametic Gulfs, which are distant 
<A NAME="506"></A>from one another only half a day's journey. They say that this Italus converted 
<A NAME="507"></A>the Oenotrians from shepherds into husbandmen, and besides other laws which 
<A NAME="508"></A>he gave them, was the founder of their common meals; even in our day some 
<A NAME="509"></A>who are derived from him retain this institution and certain other laws 
<A NAME="510"></A>of his. On the side of Italy towards Tyrrhenia dwelt the Opici, who are 
<A NAME="511"></A>now, as of old, called Ausones; and on the side towards Iapygia and the 
<A NAME="512"></A>Ionian Gulf, in the district called Siritis, the Chones, who are likewise 
<A NAME="513"></A>of Oenotrian race. From this part of the world originally came the institution 
<A NAME="514"></A>of common tables; the separation into castes from Egypt, for the reign 
<A NAME="515"></A>of Sesostris is of far greater antiquity than that of Minos. It is true 
<A NAME="516"></A>indeed that these and many other things have been invented several times 
<A NAME="517"></A>over in the course of ages, or rather times without number; for necessity 
<A NAME="518"></A>may be supposed to have taught men the inventions which were absolutely 
<A NAME="519"></A>required, and when these were provided, it was natural that other things 
<A NAME="520"></A>which would adorn and enrich life should grow up by degrees. And we may 
<A NAME="521"></A>infer that in political institutions the same rule holds. Egypt witnesses 
<A NAME="522"></A>to the antiquity of all these things, for the Egyptians appear to be of 
<A NAME="523"></A>all people the most ancient; and they have laws and a regular constitution 
<A NAME="524"></A>existing from time immemorial. We should therefore make the best use of 
<A NAME="525"></A>what has been already discovered, and try to supply 
<A NAME="526"></A>defects.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>I have already remarked that the land ought to belong to those 
<A NAME="528"></A>who possess arms and have a share in the government, and that the husbandmen 
<A NAME="529"></A>ought to be a class distinct from them; and I have determined what should 
<A NAME="530"></A>be the extent and nature of the territory. Let me proceed to discuss the 
<A NAME="531"></A>distribution of the land, and the character of the agricultural class; 
<A NAME="532"></A>for I do not think that property ought to be common, as some maintain, 
<A NAME="533"></A>but only that by friendly consent there should be a common use of it; and 
<A NAME="534"></A>that no citizen should be in want of subsistence.
<A NAME="535"></A><BR><BR>As to common meals, there is a general agreement that a well ordered 
<A NAME="536"></A>city should have them; and we will hereafter explain what are our own reasons 
<A NAME="537"></A>for taking this view. They ought, however, to be open to all the citizens. 
<A NAME="538"></A>And yet it is not easy for the poor to contribute the requisite sum out 
<A NAME="539"></A>of their private means, and to provide also for their household. The expense 
<A NAME="540"></A>of religious worship should likewise be a public charge. The land must 
<A NAME="541"></A>therefore be divided into two parts, one public and the other private, 
<A NAME="542"></A>and each part should be subdivided, part of the public land being appropriated 
<A NAME="543"></A>to the service of the Gods, and the other part used to defray the cost 
<A NAME="544"></A>of the common meals; while of the private land, part should be near the 
<A NAME="545"></A>border, and the other near the city, so that, each citizen having two lots, 
<A NAME="546"></A>they may all of them have land in both places; there is justice and fairness 
<A NAME="547"></A>in such a division, and it tends to inspire unanimity among the people 
<A NAME="548"></A>in their border wars. Where there is not this arrangement some of them 
<A NAME="549"></A>are too ready to come to blows with their neighbors, while others are so 
<A NAME="550"></A>cautious that they quite lose the sense of honor. Wherefore there is a 
<A NAME="551"></A>law in some places which forbids those who dwell near the border to take 
<A NAME="552"></A>part in public deliberations about wars with neighbors, on the ground that 
<A NAME="553"></A>their interests will pervert their judgment. For the reasons already mentioned, 
<A NAME="554"></A>then, the land should be divided in the manner described. The very best 
<A NAME="555"></A>thing of all would be that the husbandmen should be slaves taken from among 
<A NAME="556"></A>men who are not all of the same race and not spirited, for if they have 
<A NAME="557"></A>no spirit they will be better suited for their work, and there will be 
<A NAME="558"></A>no danger of their making a revolution. The next best thing would be that 
<A NAME="559"></A>they should be Perioeci of foreign race, and of a like inferior nature; 
<A NAME="560"></A>some of them should be the slaves of individuals, and employed in the private 
<A NAME="561"></A>estates of men of property, the remainder should be the property of the 
<A NAME="562"></A>state and employed on the common land. I will hereafter explain what is 
<A NAME="563"></A>the proper treatment of slaves, and why it is expedient that liberty should 
<A NAME="564"></A>be always held out to them as the reward of their services.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="565"></A><B>Part XI</B>

<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>We have already said that the city should be open to the land and 
<A NAME="567"></A>to the sea, and to the whole country as far as possible. In respect of 
<A NAME="568"></A>the place itself our wish would be that its situation should be fortunate 
<A NAME="569"></A>in four things. The first, health- this is a necessity: cities which lie 
<A NAME="570"></A>towards the east, and are blown upon by winds coming from the east, are 
<A NAME="571"></A>the healthiest; next in healthfulness are those which are sheltered from 
<A NAME="572"></A>the north wind, for they have a milder winter. The site of the city should 
<A NAME="573"></A>likewise be convenient both for political administration and for war. With 
<A NAME="574"></A>a view to the latter it should afford easy egress to the citizens, and 
<A NAME="575"></A>at the same time be inaccessible and difficult of capture to enemies. There 
<A NAME="576"></A>should be a natural abundance of springs and fountains in the town, or, 
<A NAME="577"></A>if there is a deficiency of them, great reservoirs may be established for 
<A NAME="578"></A>the collection of rainwater, such as will not fail when the inhabitants 
<A NAME="579"></A>are cut off from the country by by war. Special care should be taken of 
<A NAME="580"></A>the health of the inhabitants, which will depend chiefly on the healthiness 
<A NAME="581"></A>of the locality and of the quarter to which they are exposed, and secondly, 
<A NAME="582"></A>on the use of pure water; this latter point is by no means a secondary 
<A NAME="583"></A>consideration. For the elements which we use most and oftenest for the 
<A NAME="584"></A>support of the body contribute most to health, and among these are water 
<A NAME="585"></A>and air. Wherefore, in all wise states, if there is a want of pure water, 
<A NAME="586"></A>and the supply is not all equally good, the drinking water ought to be 
<A NAME="587"></A>separated from that which is used for other purposes.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR>As to strongholds, what is suitable to different forms of government 
<A NAME="589"></A>varies: thus an acropolis is suited to an oligarchy or a monarchy, but 
<A NAME="590"></A>a plain to a democracy; neither to an aristocracy, but rather a number 
<A NAME="591"></A>of strong places. The arrangement of private houses is considered to be 
<A NAME="592"></A>more agreeable and generally more convenient, if the streets are regularly 
<A NAME="593"></A>laid out after the modern fashion which Hippodamus introduced, but for 
<A NAME="594"></A>security in war the antiquated mode of building, which made it difficult 
<A NAME="595"></A>for strangers to get out of a town and for assailants to find their way 
<A NAME="596"></A>in, is preferable. A city should therefore adopt both plans of building: 
<A NAME="597"></A>it is possible to arrange the houses irregularly, as husbandmen plant their 
<A NAME="598"></A>vines in what are called 'clumps.' The whole town should not be laid out 
<A NAME="599"></A>in straight lines, but only certain quarters and regions; thus security 
<A NAME="600"></A>and beauty will be combined.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>As to walls, those who say that cities making any pretension to 
<A NAME="602"></A>military virtue should not have them, are quite out of date in their notions; 
<A NAME="603"></A>and they may see the cities which prided themselves on this fancy confuted 
<A NAME="604"></A>by facts. True, there is little courage shown in seeking for safety behind 
<A NAME="605"></A>a rampart when an enemy is similar in character and not much superior in 
<A NAME="606"></A>number; but the superiority of the besiegers may be and often is too much 
<A NAME="607"></A>both for ordinary human valor and for that which is found only in a few; 
<A NAME="608"></A>and if they are to be saved and to escape defeat and outrage, the strongest 
<A NAME="609"></A>wall will be the truest soldierly precaution, more especially now that 
<A NAME="610"></A>missiles and siege engines have been brought to such perfection. To have 
<A NAME="611"></A>no walls would be as foolish as to choose a site for a town in an exposed 
<A NAME="612"></A>country, and to level the heights; or as if an individual were to leave 
<A NAME="613"></A>his house unwalled, lest the inmates should become cowards. Nor must we 
<A NAME="614"></A>forget that those who have their cities surrounded by walls may either 
<A NAME="615"></A>take advantage of them or not, but cities which are unwalled have no 
<A NAME="616"></A>choice.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR>If our conclusions are just, not only should cities have walls, 
<A NAME="618"></A>but care should be taken to make them ornamental, as well as useful for 
<A NAME="619"></A>warlike purposes, and adapted to resist modern inventions. For as the assailants 
<A NAME="620"></A>of a city do all they can to gain an advantage, so the defenders should 
<A NAME="621"></A>make use of any means of defense which have been already discovered, and 
<A NAME="622"></A>should devise and invent others, for when men are well prepared no enemy 
<A NAME="623"></A>even thinks of attacking them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="624"></A><B>Part XII</B>

<A NAME="625"></A><BR><BR>As the walls are to be divided by guardhouses and towers built 
<A NAME="626"></A>at suitable intervals, and the body of citizens must be distributed at 
<A NAME="627"></A>common tables, the idea will naturally occur that we should establish some 
<A NAME="628"></A>of the common tables in the guardhouses. These might be arranged as has 
<A NAME="629"></A>been suggested; while the principal common tables of the magistrates will 
<A NAME="630"></A>occupy a suitable place, and there also will be the buildings appropriated 
<A NAME="631"></A>to religious worship except in the case of those rites which the law or 
<A NAME="632"></A>the Pythian oracle has restricted to a special locality. The site should 
<A NAME="633"></A>be a spot seen far and wide, which gives due elevation to virtue and towers 
<A NAME="634"></A>over the neighborhood. Below this spot should be established an agora, 
<A NAME="635"></A>such as that which the Thessalians call the 'freemen's agora'; from this 
<A NAME="636"></A>all trade should be excluded, and no mechanic, husbandman, or any such 
<A NAME="637"></A>person allowed to enter, unless he be summoned by the magistrates. It would 
<A NAME="638"></A>be a charming use of the place, if the gymnastic exercises of the elder 
<A NAME="639"></A>men were performed there. For in this noble practice different ages should 
<A NAME="640"></A>be separated, and some of the magistrates should stay with the boys, while 
<A NAME="641"></A>the grown-up men remain with the magistrates; for the presence of the magistrates 
<A NAME="642"></A>is the best mode of inspiring true modesty and ingenuous fear. There should 
<A NAME="643"></A>also be a traders' agora, distinct and apart from the other, in a situation 
<A NAME="644"></A>which is convenient for the reception of goods both by sea and 
<A NAME="645"></A>land.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>But in speaking of the magistrates we must not forget another section 
<A NAME="647"></A>of the citizens, viz., the priests, for whom public tables should likewise 
<A NAME="648"></A>be provided in their proper place near the temples. The magistrates who 
<A NAME="649"></A>deal with contracts, indictments, summonses, and the like, and those who 
<A NAME="650"></A>have the care of the agora and of the city, respectively, ought to be established 
<A NAME="651"></A>near an agora and some public place of meeting; the neighborhood of the 
<A NAME="652"></A>traders' agora will be a suitable spot; the upper agora we devote to the 
<A NAME="653"></A>life of leisure, the other is intended for the necessities of 
<A NAME="654"></A>trade.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>The same order should prevail in the country, for there too the 
<A NAME="656"></A>magistrates, called by some 'Inspectors of Forests' and by others 'Wardens 
<A NAME="657"></A>of the Country,' must have guardhouses and common tables while they are 
<A NAME="658"></A>on duty; temples should also be scattered throughout the country, dedicated, 
<A NAME="659"></A>some to Gods, and some to heroes.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR>But it would be a waste of time for us to linger over details like 
<A NAME="661"></A>these. The difficulty is not in imagining but in carrying them out. We 
<A NAME="662"></A>may talk about them as much as we like, but the execution of them will 
<A NAME="663"></A>depend upon fortune. Wherefore let us say no more about these matters for 
<A NAME="664"></A>the present.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="665"></A><B>Part XIII</B>

<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR>Returning to the constitution itself, let us seek to determine 
<A NAME="667"></A>out of what and what sort of elements the state which is to be happy and 
<A NAME="668"></A>well-governed should be composed. There are two things in which all which 
<A NAME="669"></A>all well-being consists: one of them is the choice of a right end and aim 
<A NAME="670"></A>of action, and the other the discovery of the actions which are means towards 
<A NAME="671"></A>it; for the means and the end may agree or disagree. Sometimes the right 
<A NAME="672"></A>end is set before men, but in practice they fail to attain it; in other 
<A NAME="673"></A>cases they are successful in all the means, but they propose to themselves 
<A NAME="674"></A>a bad end; and sometimes they fail in both. Take, for example, the art 
<A NAME="675"></A>of medicine; physicians do not always understand the nature of health, 
<A NAME="676"></A>and also the means which they use may not effect the desired end. In all 
<A NAME="677"></A>arts and sciences both the end and the means should be equally within our 
<A NAME="678"></A>control.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>The happiness and well-being which all men manifestly desire, some 
<A NAME="680"></A>have the power of attaining, but to others, from some accident or defect 
<A NAME="681"></A>of nature, the attainment of them is not granted; for a good life requires 
<A NAME="682"></A>a supply of external goods, in a less degree when men are in a good state, 
<A NAME="683"></A>in a greater degree when they are in a lower state. Others again, who possess 
<A NAME="684"></A>the conditions of happiness, go utterly wrong from the first in the pursuit 
<A NAME="685"></A>of it. But since our object is to discover the best form of government, 
<A NAME="686"></A>that, namely, under which a city will be best governed, and since the city 
<A NAME="687"></A>is best governed which has the greatest opportunity of obtaining happiness, 
<A NAME="688"></A>it is evident that we must clearly ascertain the nature of 
<A NAME="689"></A>happiness.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>We maintain, and have said in the Ethics, if the arguments there 
<A NAME="691"></A>adduced are of any value, that happiness is the realization and perfect 
<A NAME="692"></A>exercise of virtue, and this not conditional, but absolute. And I used 
<A NAME="693"></A>the term 'conditional' to express that which is indispensable, and 'absolute' 
<A NAME="694"></A>to express that which is good in itself. Take the case of just actions; 
<A NAME="695"></A>just punishments and chastisements do indeed spring from a good principle, 
<A NAME="696"></A>but they are good only because we cannot do without them- it would be better 
<A NAME="697"></A>that neither individuals nor states should need anything of the sort- but 
<A NAME="698"></A>actions which aim at honor and advantage are absolutely the best. The conditional 
<A NAME="699"></A>action is only the choice of a lesser evil; whereas these are the foundation 
<A NAME="700"></A>and creation of good. A good man may make the best even of poverty and 
<A NAME="701"></A>disease, and the other ills of life; but he can only attain happiness under 
<A NAME="702"></A>the opposite conditions (for this also has been determined in accordance 
<A NAME="703"></A>with ethical arguments, that the good man is he for whom, because he is 
<A NAME="704"></A>virtuous, the things that are absolutely good are good; it is also plain 
<A NAME="705"></A>that his use of these goods must be virtuous and in the absolute sense 
<A NAME="706"></A>good). This makes men fancy that external goods are the cause of happiness, 
<A NAME="707"></A>yet we might as well say that a brilliant performance on the lyre was to 
<A NAME="708"></A>be attributed to the instrument and not to the skill of the 
<A NAME="709"></A>performer.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR>It follows then from what has been said that some things the legislator 
<A NAME="711"></A>must find ready to his hand in a state, others he must provide. And therefore 
<A NAME="712"></A>we can only say: May our state be constituted in such a manner as to be 
<A NAME="713"></A>blessed with the goods of which fortune disposes (for we acknowledge her 
<A NAME="714"></A>power): whereas virtue and goodness in the state are not a matter of chance 
<A NAME="715"></A>but the result of knowledge and purpose. A city can be virtuous only when 
<A NAME="716"></A>the citizens who have a share in the government are virtuous, and in our 
<A NAME="717"></A>state all the citizens share in the government; let us then inquire how 
<A NAME="718"></A>a man becomes virtuous. For even if we could suppose the citizen body to 
<A NAME="719"></A>be virtuous, without each of them being so, yet the latter would be better, 
<A NAME="720"></A>for in the virtue of each the virtue of all is involved.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR>There are three things which make men good and virtuous; these 
<A NAME="722"></A>are nature, habit, rational principle. In the first place, every one must 
<A NAME="723"></A>be born a man and not some other animal; so, too, he must have a certain 
<A NAME="724"></A>character, both of body and soul. But some qualities there is no use in 
<A NAME="725"></A>having at birth, for they are altered by habit, and there are some gifts 
<A NAME="726"></A>which by nature are made to be turned by habit to good or bad. Animals 
<A NAME="727"></A>lead for the most part a life of nature, although in lesser particulars 
<A NAME="728"></A>some are influenced by habit as well. Man has rational principle, in addition, 
<A NAME="729"></A>and man only. Wherefore nature, habit, rational principle must be in harmony 
<A NAME="730"></A>with one another; for they do not always agree; men do many things against 
<A NAME="731"></A>habit and nature, if rational principle persuades them that they ought. 
<A NAME="732"></A>We have already determined what natures are likely to be most easily molded 
<A NAME="733"></A>by the hands of the legislator. An else is the work of education; we learn 
<A NAME="734"></A>some things by habit and some by instruction.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="735"></A><B>Part XIV</B>

<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR>Since every political society is composed of rulers and subjects 
<A NAME="737"></A>let us consider whether the relations of one to the other should interchange 
<A NAME="738"></A>or be permanent. For the education of the citizens will necessarily vary 
<A NAME="739"></A>with the answer given to this question. Now, if some men excelled others 
<A NAME="740"></A>in the same degree in which gods and heroes are supposed to excel mankind 
<A NAME="741"></A>in general (having in the first place a great advantage even in their bodies, 
<A NAME="742"></A>and secondly in their minds), so that the superiority of the governors 
<A NAME="743"></A>was undisputed and patent to their subjects, it would clearly be better 
<A NAME="744"></A>that once for an the one class should rule and the other serve. But since 
<A NAME="745"></A>this is unattainable, and kings have no marked superiority over their subjects, 
<A NAME="746"></A>such as Scylax affirms to be found among the Indians, it is obviously necessary 
<A NAME="747"></A>on many grounds that all the citizens alike should take their turn of governing 
<A NAME="748"></A>and being governed. Equality consists in the same treatment of similar 
<A NAME="749"></A>persons, and no government can stand which is not founded upon justice. 
<A NAME="750"></A>For if the government be unjust every one in the country unites with the 
<A NAME="751"></A>governed in the desire to have a revolution, and it is an impossibility 
<A NAME="752"></A>that the members of the government can be so numerous as to be stronger 
<A NAME="753"></A>than all their enemies put together. Yet that governors should excel their 
<A NAME="754"></A>subjects is undeniable. How all this is to be effected, and in what way 
<A NAME="755"></A>they will respectively share in the government, the legislator has to consider. 
<A NAME="756"></A>The subject has been already mentioned. Nature herself has provided the 
<A NAME="757"></A>distinction when she made a difference between old and young within the 
<A NAME="758"></A>same species, of whom she fitted the one to govern and the other to be 
<A NAME="759"></A>governed. No one takes offense at being governed when he is young, nor 
<A NAME="760"></A>does he think himself better than his governors, especially if he will 
<A NAME="761"></A>enjoy the same privilege when he reaches the required 
<A NAME="762"></A>age.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>We conclude that from one point of view governors and governed 
<A NAME="764"></A>are identical, and from another different. And therefore their education 
<A NAME="765"></A>must be the same and also different. For he who would learn to command 
<A NAME="766"></A>well must, as men say, first of all learn to obey. As I observed in the 
<A NAME="767"></A>first part of this treatise, there is one rule which is for the sake of 
<A NAME="768"></A>the rulers and another rule which is for the sake of the ruled; the former 
<A NAME="769"></A>is a despotic, the latter a free government. Some commands differ not in 
<A NAME="770"></A>the thing commanded, but in the intention with which they are imposed. 
<A NAME="771"></A>Wherefore, many apparently menial offices are an honor to the free youth 
<A NAME="772"></A>by whom they are performed; for actions do not differ as honorable or dishonorable 
<A NAME="773"></A>in themselves so much as in the end and intention of them. But since we 
<A NAME="774"></A>say that the virtue of the citizen and ruler is the same as that of the 
<A NAME="775"></A>good man, and that the same person must first be a subject and then a ruler, 
<A NAME="776"></A>the legislator has to see that they become good men, and by what means 
<A NAME="777"></A>this may be accomplished, and what is the end of the perfect 
<A NAME="778"></A>life.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR>Now the soul of man is divided into two parts, one of which has 
<A NAME="780"></A>a rational principle in itself, and the other, not having a rational principle 
<A NAME="781"></A>in itself, is able to obey such a principle. And we call a man in any way 
<A NAME="782"></A>good because he has the virtues of these two parts. In which of them the 
<A NAME="783"></A>end is more likely to be found is no matter of doubt to those who adopt 
<A NAME="784"></A>our division; for in the world both of nature and of art the inferior always 
<A NAME="785"></A>exists for the sake of the better or superior, and the better or superior 
<A NAME="786"></A>is that which has a rational principle. This principle, too, in our ordinary 
<A NAME="787"></A>way of speaking, is divided into two kinds, for there is a practical and 
<A NAME="788"></A>a speculative principle. This part, then, must evidently be similarly divided. 
<A NAME="789"></A>And there must be a corresponding division of actions; the actions of the 
<A NAME="790"></A>naturally better part are to be preferred by those who have it in their 
<A NAME="791"></A>power to attain to two out of the three or to all, for that is always to 
<A NAME="792"></A>every one the most eligible which is the highest attainable by him. The 
<A NAME="793"></A>whole of life is further divided into two parts, business and leisure, 
<A NAME="794"></A>war and peace, and of actions some aim at what is necessary and useful, 
<A NAME="795"></A>and some at what is honorable. And the preference given to one or the other 
<A NAME="796"></A>class of actions must necessarily be like the preference given to one or 
<A NAME="797"></A>other part of the soul and its actions over the other; there must be war 
<A NAME="798"></A>for the sake of peace, business for the sake of leisure, things useful 
<A NAME="799"></A>and necessary for the sake of things honorable. All these points the statesman 
<A NAME="800"></A>should keep in view when he frames his laws; he should consider the parts 
<A NAME="801"></A>of the soul and their functions, and above all the better and the end; 
<A NAME="802"></A>he should also remember the diversities of human lives and actions. For 
<A NAME="803"></A>men must be able to engage in business and go to war, but leisure and peace 
<A NAME="804"></A>are better; they must do what is necessary and indeed what is useful, but 
<A NAME="805"></A>what is honorable is better. On such principles children and persons of 
<A NAME="806"></A>every age which requires education should be trained. Whereas even the 
<A NAME="807"></A>Hellenes of the present day who are reputed to be best governed, and the 
<A NAME="808"></A>legislators who gave them their constitutions, do not appear to have framed 
<A NAME="809"></A>their governments with a regard to the best end, or to have given them 
<A NAME="810"></A>laws and education with a view to all the virtues, but in a vulgar spirit 
<A NAME="811"></A>have fallen back on those which promised to be more useful and profitable. 
<A NAME="812"></A>Many modern writers have taken a similar view: they commend the Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="813"></A>constitution, and praise the legislator for making conquest and war his 
<A NAME="814"></A>sole aim, a doctrine which may be refuted by argument and has long ago 
<A NAME="815"></A>been refuted by facts. For most men desire empire in the hope of accumulating 
<A NAME="816"></A>the goods of fortune; and on this ground Thibron and all those who have 
<A NAME="817"></A>written about the Lacedaemonian constitution have praised their legislator, 
<A NAME="818"></A>because the Lacedaemonians, by being trained to meet dangers, gained great 
<A NAME="819"></A>power. But surely they are not a happy people now that their empire has 
<A NAME="820"></A>passed away, nor was their legislator right. How ridiculous is the result, 
<A NAME="821"></A>if, when they are continuing in the observance of his laws and no one interferes 
<A NAME="822"></A>with them, they have lost the better part of life! These writers further 
<A NAME="823"></A>err about the sort of government which the legislator should approve, for 
<A NAME="824"></A>the government of freemen is nobler and implies more virtue than despotic 
<A NAME="825"></A>government. Neither is a city to be deemed happy or a legislator to be 
<A NAME="826"></A>praised because he trains his citizens to conquer and obtain dominion over 
<A NAME="827"></A>their neighbors, for there is great evil in this. On a similar principle 
<A NAME="828"></A>any citizen who could, should obviously try to obtain the power in his 
<A NAME="829"></A>own state- the crime which the Lacedaemonians accuse king Pausanias of 
<A NAME="830"></A>attempting, although he had so great honor already. No such principle and 
<A NAME="831"></A>no law having this object is either statesmanlike or useful or right. For 
<A NAME="832"></A>the same things are best both for individuals and for states, and these 
<A NAME="833"></A>are the things which the legislator ought to implant in the minds of his 
<A NAME="834"></A>citizens.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>Neither should men study war with a view to the enslavement of 
<A NAME="836"></A>those who do not deserve to be enslaved; but first of all they should provide 
<A NAME="837"></A>against their own enslavement, and in the second place obtain empire for 
<A NAME="838"></A>the good of the governed, and not for the sake of exercising a general 
<A NAME="839"></A>despotism, and in the third place they should seek to be masters only over 
<A NAME="840"></A>those who deserve to be slaves. Facts, as well as arguments, prove that 
<A NAME="841"></A>the legislator should direct all his military and other measures to the 
<A NAME="842"></A>provision of leisure and the establishment of peace. For most of these 
<A NAME="843"></A>military states are safe only while they are at war, but fall when they 
<A NAME="844"></A>have acquired their empire; like unused iron they lose their temper in 
<A NAME="845"></A>time of peace. And for this the legislator is to blame, he never having 
<A NAME="846"></A>taught them how to lead the life of peace.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="847"></A><B>Part XV</B>

<A NAME="848"></A><BR><BR>Since the end of individuals and of states is the same, the end 
<A NAME="849"></A>of the best man and of the best constitution must also be the same; it 
<A NAME="850"></A>is therefore evident that there ought to exist in both of them the virtues 
<A NAME="851"></A>of leisure; for peace, as has been often repeated, is the end of war, and 
<A NAME="852"></A>leisure of toil. But leisure and cultivation may be promoted, not only 
<A NAME="853"></A>by those virtues which are practiced in leisure, but also by some of those 
<A NAME="854"></A>which are useful to business. For many necessaries of life have to be supplied 
<A NAME="855"></A>before we can have leisure. Therefore a city must be temperate and brave, 
<A NAME="856"></A>and able to endure: for truly, as the proverb says, 'There is no leisure 
<A NAME="857"></A>for slaves,' and those who cannot face danger like men are the slaves of 
<A NAME="858"></A>any invader. Courage and endurance are required for business and philosophy 
<A NAME="859"></A>for leisure, temperance and justice for both, and more especially in times 
<A NAME="860"></A>of peace and leisure, for war compels men to be just and temperate, whereas 
<A NAME="861"></A>the enjoyment of good fortune and the leisure which comes with peace tend 
<A NAME="862"></A>to make them insolent. Those then who seem to be the best-off and to be 
<A NAME="863"></A>in the possession of every good, have special need of justice and temperance- 
<A NAME="864"></A>for example, those (if such there be, as the poets say) who dwell in the 
<A NAME="865"></A>Islands of the Blest; they above all will need philosophy and temperance 
<A NAME="866"></A>and justice, and all the more the more leisure they have, living in the 
<A NAME="867"></A>midst of abundance. There is no difficulty in seeing why the state that 
<A NAME="868"></A>would be happy and good ought to have these virtues. If it be disgraceful 
<A NAME="869"></A>in men not to be able to use the goods of life, it is peculiarly disgraceful 
<A NAME="870"></A>not to be able to use them in time of leisure- to show excellent qualities 
<A NAME="871"></A>in action and war, and when they have peace and leisure to be no better 
<A NAME="872"></A>than slaves. Wherefore we should not practice virtue after the manner of 
<A NAME="873"></A>the Lacedaemonians. For they, while agreeing with other men in their conception 
<A NAME="874"></A>of the highest goods, differ from the rest of mankind in thinking that 
<A NAME="875"></A>they are to be obtained by the practice of a single virtue. And since they 
<A NAME="876"></A>think these goods and the enjoyment of them greater than the enjoyment 
<A NAME="877"></A>derived from the virtues ... and that it should be practiced for its own 
<A NAME="878"></A>sake, is evident from what has been said; we must now consider how and 
<A NAME="879"></A>by what means it is to be attained.
<A NAME="880"></A><BR><BR>We have already determined that nature and habit and rational principle 
<A NAME="881"></A>are required, and, of these, the proper nature of the citizens has also 
<A NAME="882"></A>been defined by us. But we have still to consider whether the training 
<A NAME="883"></A>of early life is to be that of rational principle or habit, for these two 
<A NAME="884"></A>must accord, and when in accord they will then form the best of harmonies. 
<A NAME="885"></A>The rational principle may be mistaken and fail in attaining the highest 
<A NAME="886"></A>ideal of life, and there may be a like evil influence of habit. Thus much 
<A NAME="887"></A>is clear in the first place, that, as in all other things, birth implies 
<A NAME="888"></A>an antecedent beginning, and that there are beginnings whose end is relative 
<A NAME="889"></A>to a further end. Now, in men rational principle and mind are the end towards 
<A NAME="890"></A>which nature strives, so that the birth and moral discipline of the citizens 
<A NAME="891"></A>ought to be ordered with a view to them. In the second place, as the soul 
<A NAME="892"></A>and body are two, we see also that there are two parts of the soul, the 
<A NAME="893"></A>rational and the irrational, and two corresponding states- reason and appetite. 
<A NAME="894"></A>And as the body is prior in order of generation to the soul, so the irrational 
<A NAME="895"></A>is prior to the rational. The proof is that anger and wishing and desire 
<A NAME="896"></A>are implanted in children from their very birth, but reason and understanding 
<A NAME="897"></A>are developed as they grow older. Wherefore, the care of the body ought 
<A NAME="898"></A>to precede that of the soul, and the training of the appetitive part should 
<A NAME="899"></A>follow: none the less our care of it must be for the sake of the reason, 
<A NAME="900"></A>and our care of the body for the sake of the soul.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="901"></A><B>Part XVI</B>

<A NAME="902"></A><BR><BR>Since the legislator should begin by considering how the frames 
<A NAME="903"></A>of the children whom he is rearing may be as good as possible, his first 
<A NAME="904"></A>care will be about marriage- at what age should his citizens marry, and 
<A NAME="905"></A>who are fit to marry? In legislating on this subject he ought to consider 
<A NAME="906"></A>the persons and the length of their life, that their procreative life may 
<A NAME="907"></A>terminate at the same period, and that they may not differ in their bodily 
<A NAME="908"></A>powers, as will be the case if the man is still able to beget children 
<A NAME="909"></A>while the woman is unable to bear them, or the woman able to bear while 
<A NAME="910"></A>the man is unable to beget, for from these causes arise quarrels and differences 
<A NAME="911"></A>between married persons. Secondly, he must consider the time at which the 
<A NAME="912"></A>children will succeed to their parents; there ought not to be too great 
<A NAME="913"></A>an interval of age, for then the parents will be too old to derive any 
<A NAME="914"></A>pleasure from their affection, or to be of any use to them. Nor ought they 
<A NAME="915"></A>to be too nearly of an age; to youthful marriages there are many objections- 
<A NAME="916"></A>the children will be wanting in respect to the parents, who will seem to 
<A NAME="917"></A>be their contemporaries, and disputes will arise in the management of the 
<A NAME="918"></A>household. Thirdly, and this is the point from which we digressed, the 
<A NAME="919"></A>legislator must mold to his will the frames of newly-born children. Almost 
<A NAME="920"></A>all these objects may be secured by attention to one point. Since the time 
<A NAME="921"></A>of generation is commonly limited within the age of seventy years in the 
<A NAME="922"></A>case of a man, and of fifty in the case of a woman, the commencement of 
<A NAME="923"></A>the union should conform to these periods. The union of male and female 
<A NAME="924"></A>when too young is bad for the procreation of children; in all other animals 
<A NAME="925"></A>the offspring of the young are small and in-developed, and with a tendency 
<A NAME="926"></A>to produce female children, and therefore also in man, as is proved by 
<A NAME="927"></A>the fact that in those cities in which men and women are accustomed to 
<A NAME="928"></A>marry young, the people are small and weak; in childbirth also younger 
<A NAME="929"></A>women suffer more, and more of them die; some persons say that this was 
<A NAME="930"></A>the meaning of the response once given to the Troezenians- the oracle really 
<A NAME="931"></A>meant that many died because they married too young; it had nothing to 
<A NAME="932"></A>do with the ingathering of the harvest. It also conduces to temperance 
<A NAME="933"></A>not to marry too soon; for women who marry early are apt to be wanton; 
<A NAME="934"></A>and in men too the bodily frame is stunted if they marry while the seed 
<A NAME="935"></A>is growing (for there is a time when the growth of the seed, also, ceases, 
<A NAME="936"></A>or continues to but a slight extent). Women should marry when they are 
<A NAME="937"></A>about eighteen years of age, and men at seven and thirty; then they are 
<A NAME="938"></A>in the prime of life, and the decline in the powers of both will coincide. 
<A NAME="939"></A>Further, the children, if their birth takes place soon, as may reasonably 
<A NAME="940"></A>be expected, will succeed in the beginning of their prime, when the fathers 
<A NAME="941"></A>are already in the decline of life, and have nearly reached their term 
<A NAME="942"></A>of three-score years and ten.
<A NAME="943"></A><BR><BR>Thus much of the age proper for marriage: the season of the year 
<A NAME="944"></A>should also be considered; according to our present custom, people generally 
<A NAME="945"></A>limit marriage to the season of winter, and they are right. The precepts 
<A NAME="946"></A>of physicians and natural philosophers about generation should also be 
<A NAME="947"></A>studied by the parents themselves; the physicians give good advice about 
<A NAME="948"></A>the favorable conditions of the body, and the natural philosophers about 
<A NAME="949"></A>the winds; of which they prefer the north to the south.
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><BR>What constitution in the parent is most advantageous to the offspring 
<A NAME="951"></A>is a subject which we will consider more carefully when we speak of the 
<A NAME="952"></A>education of children, and we will only make a few general remarks at present. 
<A NAME="953"></A>The constitution of an athlete is not suited to the life of a citizen, 
<A NAME="954"></A>or to health, or to the procreation of children, any more than the valetudinarian 
<A NAME="955"></A>or exhausted constitution, but one which is in a mean between them. A man's 
<A NAME="956"></A>constitution should be inured to labor, but not to labor which is excessive 
<A NAME="957"></A>or of one sort only, such as is practiced by athletes; he should be capable 
<A NAME="958"></A>of all the actions of a freeman. These remarks apply equally to both 
<A NAME="959"></A>parents.
<A NAME="960"></A><BR><BR>Women who are with child should be careful of themselves; they 
<A NAME="961"></A>should take exercise and have a nourishing diet. The first of these prescriptions 
<A NAME="962"></A>the legislator will easily carry into effect by requiring that they shall 
<A NAME="963"></A>take a walk daily to some temple, where they can worship the gods who preside 
<A NAME="964"></A>over birth. Their minds, however, unlike their bodies, they ought to keep 
<A NAME="965"></A>quiet, for the offspring derive their natures from their mothers as plants 
<A NAME="966"></A>do from the earth.
<A NAME="967"></A><BR><BR>As to the exposure and rearing of children, let there be a law 
<A NAME="968"></A>that no deformed child shall live, but that on the ground of an excess 
<A NAME="969"></A>in the number of children, if the established customs of the state forbid 
<A NAME="970"></A>this (for in our state population has a limit), no child is to be exposed, 
<A NAME="971"></A>but when couples have children in excess, let abortion be procured before 
<A NAME="972"></A>sense and life have begun; what may or may not be lawfully done in these 
<A NAME="973"></A>cases depends on the question of life and sensation.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR><BR>And now, having determined at what ages men and women are to begin 
<A NAME="975"></A>their union, let us also determine how long they shall continue to beget 
<A NAME="976"></A>and bear offspring for the state; men who are too old, like men who are 
<A NAME="977"></A>too young, produce children who are defective in body and mind; the children 
<A NAME="978"></A>of very old men are weakly. The limit then, should be the age which is 
<A NAME="979"></A>the prime of their intelligence, and this in most persons, according to 
<A NAME="980"></A>the notion of some poets who measure life by periods of seven years, is 
<A NAME="981"></A>about fifty; at four or five years or later, they should cease from having 
<A NAME="982"></A>families; and from that time forward only cohabit with one another for 
<A NAME="983"></A>the sake of health; or for some similar reason.
<A NAME="984"></A><BR><BR>As to adultery, let it be held disgraceful, in general, for any 
<A NAME="985"></A>man or woman to be found in any way unfaithful when they are married, and 
<A NAME="986"></A>called husband and wife. If during the time of bearing children anything 
<A NAME="987"></A>of the sort occur, let the guilty person be punished with a loss of privileges 
<A NAME="988"></A>in proportion to the offense.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="989"></A><B>Part XVII</B>

<A NAME="990"></A><BR><BR>After the children have been born, the manner of rearing them may 
<A NAME="991"></A>be supposed to have a great effect on their bodily strength. It would appear 
<A NAME="992"></A>from the example of animals, and of those nations who desire to create 
<A NAME="993"></A>the military habit, that the food which has most milk in it is best suited 
<A NAME="994"></A>to human beings; but the less wine the better, if they would escape diseases. 
<A NAME="995"></A>Also all the motions to which children can be subjected at their early 
<A NAME="996"></A>age are very useful. But in order to preserve their tender limbs from distortion, 
<A NAME="997"></A>some nations have had recourse to mechanical appliances which straighten 
<A NAME="998"></A>their bodies. To accustom children to the cold from their earliest years 
<A NAME="999"></A>is also an excellent practice, which greatly conduces to health, and hardens 
<A NAME="1000"></A>them for military service. Hence many barbarians have a custom of plunging 
<A NAME="1001"></A>their children at birth into a cold stream; others, like the Celts, clothe 
<A NAME="1002"></A>them in a light wrapper only. For human nature should be early habituated 
<A NAME="1003"></A>to endure all which by habit it can be made to endure; but the process 
<A NAME="1004"></A>must be gradual. And children, from their natural warmth, may be easily 
<A NAME="1005"></A>trained to bear cold. Such care should attend them in the first stage of 
<A NAME="1006"></A>life.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR><BR>The next period lasts to the age of five; during this no demand 
<A NAME="1008"></A>should be made upon the child for study or labor, lest its growth be impeded; 
<A NAME="1009"></A>and there should be sufficient motion to prevent the limbs from being inactive. 
<A NAME="1010"></A>This can be secured, among other ways, by amusement, but the amusement 
<A NAME="1011"></A>should not be vulgar or tiring or effeminate. The Directors of Education, 
<A NAME="1012"></A>as they are termed, should be careful what tales or stories the children 
<A NAME="1013"></A>hear, for all such things are designed to prepare the way for the business 
<A NAME="1014"></A>of later life, and should be for the most part imitations of the occupations 
<A NAME="1015"></A>which they will hereafter pursue in earnest. Those are wrong who in their 
<A NAME="1016"></A>laws attempt to check the loud crying and screaming of children, for these 
<A NAME="1017"></A>contribute towards their growth, and, in a manner, exercise their bodies. 
<A NAME="1018"></A>Straining the voice has a strengthening effect similar to that produced 
<A NAME="1019"></A>by the retention of the breath in violent exertions. The Directors of Education 
<A NAME="1020"></A>should have an eye to their bringing up, and in particular should take 
<A NAME="1021"></A>care that they are left as little as possible with slaves. For until they 
<A NAME="1022"></A>are seven years old they must five at home; and therefore, even at this 
<A NAME="1023"></A>early age, it is to be expected that they should acquire a taint of meanness 
<A NAME="1024"></A>from what they hear and see. Indeed, there is nothing which the legislator 
<A NAME="1025"></A>should be more careful to drive away than indecency of speech; for the 
<A NAME="1026"></A>light utterance of shameful words leads soon to shameful actions. The young 
<A NAME="1027"></A>especially should never be allowed to repeat or hear anything of the sort. 
<A NAME="1028"></A>A freeman who is found saying or doing what is forbidden, if he be too 
<A NAME="1029"></A>young as yet to have the privilege of reclining at the public tables, should 
<A NAME="1030"></A>be disgraced and beaten, and an elder person degraded as his slavish conduct 
<A NAME="1031"></A>deserves. And since we do not allow improper language, clearly we should 
<A NAME="1032"></A>also banish pictures or speeches from the stage which are indecent. Let 
<A NAME="1033"></A>the rulers take care that there be no image or picture representing unseemly 
<A NAME="1034"></A>actions, except in the temples of those Gods at whose festivals the law 
<A NAME="1035"></A>permits even ribaldry, and whom the law also permits to be worshipped by 
<A NAME="1036"></A>persons of mature age on behalf of themselves, their children, and their 
<A NAME="1037"></A>wives. But the legislator should not allow youth to be spectators of iambi 
<A NAME="1038"></A>or of comedy until they are of an age to sit at the public tables and to 
<A NAME="1039"></A>drink strong wine; by that time education will have armed them against 
<A NAME="1040"></A>the evil influences of such representations.
<A NAME="1041"></A><BR><BR>We have made these remarks in a cursory manner- they are enough 
<A NAME="1042"></A>for the present occasion; but hereafter we will return to the subject and 
<A NAME="1043"></A>after a fuller discussion determine whether such liberty should or should 
<A NAME="1044"></A>not be granted, and in what way granted, if at all. Theodorus, the tragic 
<A NAME="1045"></A>actor, was quite right in saying that he would not allow any other actor, 
<A NAME="1046"></A>not even if he were quite second-rate, to enter before himself, because 
<A NAME="1047"></A>the spectators grew fond of the voices which they first heard. And the 
<A NAME="1048"></A>same principle applies universally to association with things as well as 
<A NAME="1049"></A>with persons, for we always like best whatever comes first. And therefore 
<A NAME="1050"></A>youth should be kept strangers to all that is bad, and especially to things 
<A NAME="1051"></A>which suggest vice or hate. When the five years have passed away, during 
<A NAME="1052"></A>the two following years they must look on at the pursuits which they are 
<A NAME="1053"></A>hereafter to learn. There are two periods of life with reference to which 
<A NAME="1054"></A>education has to be divided, from seven to the age of puberty, and onwards 
<A NAME="1055"></A>to the age of one and twenty. The poets who divide ages by sevens are in 
<A NAME="1056"></A>the main right: but we should observe the divisions actually made by nature; 
<A NAME="1057"></A>for the deficiencies of nature are what art and education seek to fill 
<A NAME="1058"></A>up.
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR><BR>Let us then first inquire if any regulations are to be laid down 
<A NAME="1060"></A>about children, and secondly, whether the care of them should be the concern 
<A NAME="1061"></A>of the state or of private individuals, which latter is in our own day 
<A NAME="1062"></A>the common custom, and in the third place, what these regulations should 
<A NAME="1063"></A>be.
