<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Everything which changes does so in one of three senses. It may change 
<A NAME="12"></A>(1) accidentally, as for instance when we say that something musical walks, 
<A NAME="13"></A>that which walks being something in which aptitude for music is an accident. 
<A NAME="14"></A>Again (2) a thing is said without qualification to change because something 
<A NAME="15"></A>belonging to it changes, i.e. in statements which refer to part of the 
<A NAME="16"></A>thing in question: thus the body is restored to health because the eye 
<A NAME="17"></A>or the chest, that is to say a part of the whole body, is restored to health. 
<A NAME="18"></A>And above all there is (3) the case of a thing which is in motion neither 
<A NAME="19"></A>accidentally nor in respect of something else belonging to it, but in virtue 
<A NAME="20"></A>of being itself directly in motion. Here we have a thing which is essentially 
<A NAME="21"></A>movable: and that which is so is a different thing according to the particular 
<A NAME="22"></A>variety of motion: for instance it may be a thing capable of alteration: 
<A NAME="23"></A>and within the sphere of alteration it is again a different thing according 
<A NAME="24"></A>as it is capable of being restored to health or capable of being heated. 
<A NAME="25"></A>And there are the same distinctions in the case of the mover: (1) one thing 
<A NAME="26"></A>causes motion accidentally, (2) another partially (because something belonging 
<A NAME="27"></A>to it causes motion), (3) another of itself directly, as, for instance, 
<A NAME="28"></A>the physician heals, the hand strikes. We have, then, the following factors: 
<A NAME="29"></A>(a) on the one hand that which directly causes motion, and (b) on the other 
<A NAME="30"></A>hand that which is in motion: further, we have (c) that in which motion 
<A NAME="31"></A>takes place, namely time, and (distinct from these three) (d) that from 
<A NAME="32"></A>which and (e) that to which it proceeds: for every motion proceeds from 
<A NAME="33"></A>something and to something, that which is directly in motion being distinct 
<A NAME="34"></A>from that to which it is in motion and that from which it is in motion: 
<A NAME="35"></A>for instance, we may take the three things 'wood', 'hot', and 'cold', of 
<A NAME="36"></A>which the first is that which is in motion, the second is that to which 
<A NAME="37"></A>the motion proceeds, and the third is that from which it proceeds. This 
<A NAME="38"></A>being so, it is clear that the motion is in the wood, not in its form: 
<A NAME="39"></A>for the motion is neither caused nor experienced by the form or the place 
<A NAME="40"></A>or the quantity. So we are left with a mover, a moved, and a goal of motion. 
<A NAME="41"></A>I do not include the starting-point of motion: for it is the goal rather 
<A NAME="42"></A>than the starting-point of motion that gives its name to a particular process 
<A NAME="43"></A>of change. Thus 'perishing' is change to not-being, though it is also true 
<A NAME="44"></A>that that that which perishes changes from being: and 'becoming' is change 
<A NAME="45"></A>to being, though it is also change from not-being.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>Now a definition of motion has been given above, from which it 
<A NAME="47"></A>will be seen that every goal of motion, whether it be a form, an affection, 
<A NAME="48"></A>or a place, is immovable, as, for instance, knowledge and heat. Here, however, 
<A NAME="49"></A>a difficulty may be raised. Affections, it may be said, are motions, and 
<A NAME="50"></A>whiteness is an affection: thus there may be change to a motion. To this 
<A NAME="51"></A>we may reply that it is not whiteness but whitening that is a motion. Here 
<A NAME="52"></A>also the same distinctions are to be observed: a goal of motion may be 
<A NAME="53"></A>so accidentally, or partially and with reference to something other than 
<A NAME="54"></A>itself, or directly and with no reference to anything else: for instance, 
<A NAME="55"></A>a thing which is becoming white changes accidentally to an object of thought, 
<A NAME="56"></A>the colour being only accidentally the object of thought; it changes to 
<A NAME="57"></A>colour, because white is a part of colour, or to Europe, because Athens 
<A NAME="58"></A>is a part of Europe; but it changes essentially to white colour. It is 
<A NAME="59"></A>now clear in what sense a thing is in motion essentially, accidentally, 
<A NAME="60"></A>or in respect of something other than itself, and in what sense the phrase 
<A NAME="61"></A>'itself directly' is used in the case both of the mover and of the moved: 
<A NAME="62"></A>and it is also clear that the motion is not in the form but in that which 
<A NAME="63"></A>is in motion, that is to say 'the movable in activity'. Now accidental 
<A NAME="64"></A>change we may leave out of account: for it is to be found in everything, 
<A NAME="65"></A>at any time, and in any respect. Change which is not accidental on the 
<A NAME="66"></A>other hand is not to be found in everything, but only in contraries, in 
<A NAME="67"></A>things intermediate contraries, and in contradictories, as may be proved 
<A NAME="68"></A>by induction. An intermediate may be a starting-point of change, since 
<A NAME="69"></A>for the purposes of the change it serves as contrary to either of two contraries: 
<A NAME="70"></A>for the intermediate is in a sense the extremes. Hence we speak of the 
<A NAME="71"></A>intermediate as in a sense a contrary relatively to the extremes and of 
<A NAME="72"></A>either extreme as a contrary relatively to the intermediate: for instance, 
<A NAME="73"></A>the central note is low relatively-to the highest and high relatively to 
<A NAME="74"></A>the lowest, and grey is light relatively to black and dark relatively to 
<A NAME="75"></A>white.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>And since every change is from something to something-as the word 
<A NAME="77"></A>itself (metabole) indicates, implying something 'after' (meta) something 
<A NAME="78"></A>else, that is to say something earlier and something later-that which changes 
<A NAME="79"></A>must change in one of four ways: from subject to subject, from subject 
<A NAME="80"></A>to nonsubject, from non-subject to subject, or from non-subject to non-subject, 
<A NAME="81"></A>where by 'subject' I mean what is affirmatively expressed. So it follows 
<A NAME="82"></A>necessarily from what has been said above that there are only three kinds 
<A NAME="83"></A>of change, that from subject to subject, that from subject to non-subject, 
<A NAME="84"></A>and that from non-subject to subject: for the fourth conceivable kind, 
<A NAME="85"></A>that from non-subject to nonsubject, is not change, as in that case there 
<A NAME="86"></A>is no opposition either of contraries or of contradictories.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>Now change from non-subject to subject, the relation being that 
<A NAME="88"></A>of contradiction, is 'coming to be'-'unqualified coming to be' when the 
<A NAME="89"></A>change takes place in an unqualified way, 'particular coming to be' when 
<A NAME="90"></A>the change is change in a particular character: for instance, a change 
<A NAME="91"></A>from not-white to white is a coming to be of the particular thing, white, 
<A NAME="92"></A>while change from unqualified not-being to being is coming to be in an 
<A NAME="93"></A>unqualified way, in respect of which we say that a thing 'comes to be' 
<A NAME="94"></A>without qualification, not that it 'comes to be' some particular thing. 
<A NAME="95"></A>Change from subject to non-subject is 'perishing'-'unqualified perishing' 
<A NAME="96"></A>when the change is from being to not-being, 'particular perishing' when 
<A NAME="97"></A>the change is to the opposite negation, the distinction being the same 
<A NAME="98"></A>as that made in the case of coming to be.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>Now the expression 'not-being' is used in several senses: and there 
<A NAME="100"></A>can be motion neither of that which 'is not' in respect of the affirmation 
<A NAME="101"></A>or negation of a predicate, nor of that which 'is not' in the sense that 
<A NAME="102"></A>it only potentially 'is', that is to say the opposite of that which actually 
<A NAME="103"></A>'is' in an unqualified sense: for although that which is 'not-white' or 
<A NAME="104"></A>'not-good' may nevertheless he in motion accidentally (for example that 
<A NAME="105"></A>which is 'not-white' might be a man), yet that which is without qualification 
<A NAME="106"></A>'not-so-and-so' cannot in any sense be in motion: therefore it is impossible 
<A NAME="107"></A>for that which is not to be in motion. This being so, it follows that 'becoming' 
<A NAME="108"></A>cannot be a motion: for it is that which 'is not' that 'becomes'. For however 
<A NAME="109"></A>true it may be that it accidentally 'becomes', it is nevertheless correct 
<A NAME="110"></A>to say that it is that which 'is not' that in an unqualified sense 'becomes'. 
<A NAME="111"></A>And similarly it is impossible for that which 'is not' to be at 
<A NAME="112"></A>rest.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>There are these difficulties, then, in the way of the assumption 
<A NAME="114"></A>that that which 'is not' can be in motion: and it may be further objected 
<A NAME="115"></A>that, whereas everything which is in motion is in space, that which 'is 
<A NAME="116"></A>not' is not in space: for then it would be somewhere.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>So, too, 'perishing' is not a motion: for a motion has for its 
<A NAME="118"></A>contrary either another motion or rest, whereas 'perishing' is the contrary 
<A NAME="119"></A>of 'becoming'.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>Since, then, every motion is a kind of change, and there are only 
<A NAME="121"></A>the three kinds of change mentioned above, and since of these three those 
<A NAME="122"></A>which take the form of 'becoming' and 'perishing', that is to say those 
<A NAME="123"></A>which imply a relation of contradiction, are not motions: it necessarily 
<A NAME="124"></A>follows that only change from subject to subject is motion. And every such 
<A NAME="125"></A>subject is either a contrary or an intermediate (for a privation may be 
<A NAME="126"></A>allowed to rank as a contrary) and can be affirmatively expressed, as naked, 
<A NAME="127"></A>toothless, or black. If, then, the categories are severally distinguished 
<A NAME="128"></A>as Being, Quality, Place, Time, Relation, Quantity, and Activity or Passivity, 
<A NAME="129"></A>it necessarily follows that there are three kinds of motion-qualitative, 
<A NAME="130"></A>quantitative, and local.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="131"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>In respect of Substance there is no motion, because Substance has 
<A NAME="133"></A>no contrary among things that are. Nor is there motion in respect of Relation: 
<A NAME="134"></A>for it may happen that when one correlative changes, the other, although 
<A NAME="135"></A>this does not itself change, is no longer applicable, so that in these 
<A NAME="136"></A>cases the motion is accidental. Nor is there motion in respect of Agent 
<A NAME="137"></A>and Patient-in fact there can never be motion of mover and moved, because 
<A NAME="138"></A>there cannot be motion of motion or becoming of becoming or in general 
<A NAME="139"></A>change of change.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>For in the first place there are two senses in which motion of 
<A NAME="141"></A>motion is conceivable. (1) The motion of which there is motion might be 
<A NAME="142"></A>conceived as subject; e.g. a man is in motion because he changes from fair 
<A NAME="143"></A>to dark. Can it be that in this sense motion grows hot or cold, or changes 
<A NAME="144"></A>place, or increases or decreases? Impossible: for change is not a subject. 
<A NAME="145"></A>Or (2) can there be motion of motion in the sense that some other subject 
<A NAME="146"></A>changes from a change to another mode of being, as e.g. a man changes from 
<A NAME="147"></A>falling ill to getting well? Even this is possible only in an accidental 
<A NAME="148"></A>sense. For, whatever the subject may be, movement is change from one form 
<A NAME="149"></A>to another. (And the same holds good of becoming and perishing, except 
<A NAME="150"></A>that in these processes we have a change to a particular kind of opposite, 
<A NAME="151"></A>while the other, motion, is a change to a different kind.) So, if there 
<A NAME="152"></A>is to be motion of motion, that which is changing from health to sickness 
<A NAME="153"></A>must simultaneously be changing from this very change to another. It is 
<A NAME="154"></A>clear, then, that by the time that it has become sick, it must also have 
<A NAME="155"></A>changed to whatever may be the other change concerned (for that it should 
<A NAME="156"></A>be at rest, though logically possible, is excluded by the theory). Moreover 
<A NAME="157"></A>this other can never be any casual change, but must be a change from something 
<A NAME="158"></A>definite to some other definite thing. So in this case it must be the opposite 
<A NAME="159"></A>change, viz. convalescence. It is only accidentally that there can be change 
<A NAME="160"></A>of change, e.g. there is a change from remembering to forgetting only because 
<A NAME="161"></A>the subject of this change changes at one time to knowledge, at another 
<A NAME="162"></A>to ignorance.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>In the second place, if there is to be change of change and becoming 
<A NAME="164"></A>of becoming, we shall have an infinite regress. Thus if one of a series 
<A NAME="165"></A>of changes is to be a change of change, the preceding change must also 
<A NAME="166"></A>be so: e.g. if simple becoming was ever in process of becoming, then that 
<A NAME="167"></A>which was becoming simple becoming was also in process of becoming, so 
<A NAME="168"></A>that we should not yet have arrived at what was in process of simple becoming 
<A NAME="169"></A>but only at what was already in process of becoming in process of becoming. 
<A NAME="170"></A>And this again was sometime in process of becoming, so that even then we 
<A NAME="171"></A>should not have arrived at what was in process of simple becoming. And 
<A NAME="172"></A>since in an infinite series there is no first term, here there will be 
<A NAME="173"></A>no first stage and therefore no following stage either. On this hypothesis, 
<A NAME="174"></A>then, nothing can become or be moved or change.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>Thirdly, if a thing is capable of any particular motion, it is 
<A NAME="176"></A>also capable of the corresponding contrary motion or the corresponding 
<A NAME="177"></A>coming to rest, and a thing that is capable of becoming is also capable 
<A NAME="178"></A>of perishing: consequently, if there be becoming of becoming, that which 
<A NAME="179"></A>is in process of becoming is in process of perishing at the very moment 
<A NAME="180"></A>when it has reached the stage of becoming: since it cannot be in process 
<A NAME="181"></A>of perishing when it is just beginning to become or after it has ceased 
<A NAME="182"></A>to become: for that which is in process of perishing must be in 
<A NAME="183"></A>existence.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>Fourthly, there must be a substrate underlying all processes of 
<A NAME="185"></A>becoming and changing. What can this be in the present case? It is either 
<A NAME="186"></A>the body or the soul that undergoes alteration: what is it that correspondingly 
<A NAME="187"></A>becomes motion or becoming? And again what is the goal of their motion? 
<A NAME="188"></A>It must be the motion or becoming of something from something to something 
<A NAME="189"></A>else. But in what sense can this be so? For the becoming of learning cannot 
<A NAME="190"></A>be learning: so neither can the becoming of becoming be becoming, nor can 
<A NAME="191"></A>the becoming of any process be that process.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>Finally, since there are three kinds of motion, the substratum 
<A NAME="193"></A>and the goal of motion must be one or other of these, e.g. locomotion will 
<A NAME="194"></A>have to be altered or to be locally moved.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>To sum up, then, since everything that is moved is moved in one 
<A NAME="196"></A>of three ways, either accidentally, or partially, or essentially, change 
<A NAME="197"></A>can change only accidentally, as e.g. when a man who is being restored 
<A NAME="198"></A>to health runs or learns: and accidental change we have long ago decided 
<A NAME="199"></A>to leave out of account.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>Since, then, motion can belong neither to Being nor to Relation 
<A NAME="201"></A>nor to Agent and Patient, it remains that there can be motion only in respect 
<A NAME="202"></A>of Quality, Quantity, and Place: for with each of these we have a pair 
<A NAME="203"></A>of contraries. Motion in respect of Quality let us call alteration, a general 
<A NAME="204"></A>designation that is used to include both contraries: and by Quality I do 
<A NAME="205"></A>not here mean a property of substance (in that sense that which constitutes 
<A NAME="206"></A>a specific distinction is a quality) but a passive quality in virtue of 
<A NAME="207"></A>which a thing is said to be acted on or to be incapable of being acted 
<A NAME="208"></A>on. Motion in respect of Quantity has no name that includes both contraries, 
<A NAME="209"></A>but it is called increase or decrease according as one or the other is 
<A NAME="210"></A>designated: that is to say motion in the direction of complete magnitude 
<A NAME="211"></A>is increase, motion in the contrary direction is decrease. Motion in respect 
<A NAME="212"></A>of Place has no name either general or particular: but we may designate 
<A NAME="213"></A>it by the general name of locomotion, though strictly the term 'locomotion' 
<A NAME="214"></A>is applicable to things that change their place only when they have not 
<A NAME="215"></A>the power to come to a stand, and to things that do not move themselves 
<A NAME="216"></A>locally.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>Change within the same kind from a lesser to a greater or from 
<A NAME="218"></A>a greater to a lesser degree is alteration: for it is motion either from 
<A NAME="219"></A>a contrary or to a contrary, whether in an unqualified or in a qualified 
<A NAME="220"></A>sense: for change to a lesser degree of a quality will be called change 
<A NAME="221"></A>to the contrary of that quality, and change to a greater degree of a quality 
<A NAME="222"></A>will be regarded as change from the contrary of that quality to the quality 
<A NAME="223"></A>itself. It makes no difference whether the change be qualified or unqualified, 
<A NAME="224"></A>except that in the former case the contraries will have to be contrary 
<A NAME="225"></A>to one another only in a qualified sense: and a thing's possessing a quality 
<A NAME="226"></A>in a greater or in a lesser degree means the presence or absence in it 
<A NAME="227"></A>of more or less of the opposite quality. It is now clear, then, that there 
<A NAME="228"></A>are only these three kinds of motion.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>The term 'immovable' we apply in the first place to that which 
<A NAME="230"></A>is absolutely incapable of being moved (just as we correspondingly apply 
<A NAME="231"></A>the term invisible to sound); in the second place to that which is moved 
<A NAME="232"></A>with difficulty after a long time or whose movement is slow at the start-in 
<A NAME="233"></A>fact, what we describe as hard to move; and in the third place to that 
<A NAME="234"></A>which is naturally designed for and capable of motion, but is not in motion 
<A NAME="235"></A>when, where, and as it naturally would be so. This last is the only kind 
<A NAME="236"></A>of immovable thing of which I use the term 'being at rest': for rest is 
<A NAME="237"></A>contrary to motion, so that rest will be negation of motion in that which 
<A NAME="238"></A>is capable of admitting motion.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>The foregoing remarks are sufficient to explain the essential nature 
<A NAME="240"></A>of motion and rest, the number of kinds of change, and the different varieties 
<A NAME="241"></A>of motion.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="242"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>Let us now proceed to define the terms 'together' and 'apart', 
<A NAME="244"></A>'in contact', 'between', 'in succession', 'contiguous', and 'continuous', 
<A NAME="245"></A>and to show in what circumstances each of these terms is naturally 
<A NAME="246"></A>applicable.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>Things are said to be together in place when they are in one place 
<A NAME="248"></A>(in the strictest sense of the word 'place') and to be apart when they 
<A NAME="249"></A>are in different places.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>Things are said to be in contact when their extremities are 
<A NAME="251"></A>together.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>That which a changing thing, if it changes continuously in a natural 
<A NAME="253"></A>manner, naturally reaches before it reaches that to which it changes last, 
<A NAME="254"></A>is between. Thus 'between' implies the presence of at least three things: 
<A NAME="255"></A>for in a process of change it is the contrary that is 'last': and a thing 
<A NAME="256"></A>is moved continuously if it leaves no gap or only the smallest possible 
<A NAME="257"></A>gap in the material-not in the time (for a gap in the time does not prevent 
<A NAME="258"></A>things having a 'between', while, on the other hand, there is nothing to 
<A NAME="259"></A>prevent the highest note sounding immediately after the lowest) but in 
<A NAME="260"></A>the material in which the motion takes place. This is manifestly true not 
<A NAME="261"></A>only in local changes but in every other kind as well. (Now every change 
<A NAME="262"></A>implies a pair of opposites, and opposites may be either contraries or 
<A NAME="263"></A>contradictories; since then contradiction admits of no mean term, it is 
<A NAME="264"></A>obvious that 'between' must imply a pair of contraries) That is locally 
<A NAME="265"></A>contrary which is most distant in a straight line: for the shortest line 
<A NAME="266"></A>is definitely limited, and that which is definitely limited constitutes 
<A NAME="267"></A>a measure.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>A thing is 'in succession' when it is after the beginning in position 
<A NAME="269"></A>or in form or in some other respect in which it is definitely so regarded, 
<A NAME="270"></A>and when further there is nothing of the same kind as itself between it 
<A NAME="271"></A>and that to which it is in succession, e.g. a line or lines if it is a 
<A NAME="272"></A>line, a unit or units if it is a unit, a house if it is a house (there 
<A NAME="273"></A>is nothing to prevent something of a different kind being between). For 
<A NAME="274"></A>that which is in succession is in succession to a particular thing, and 
<A NAME="275"></A>is something posterior: for one is not 'in succession' to two, nor is the 
<A NAME="276"></A>first day of the month to be second: in each case the latter is 'in succession' 
<A NAME="277"></A>to the former.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>A thing that is in succession and touches is 'contiguous'. The 
<A NAME="279"></A>'continuous' is a subdivision of the contiguous: things are called continuous 
<A NAME="280"></A>when the touching limits of each become one and the same and are, as the 
<A NAME="281"></A>word implies, contained in each other: continuity is impossible if these 
<A NAME="282"></A>extremities are two. This definition makes it plain that continuity belongs 
<A NAME="283"></A>to things that naturally in virtue of their mutual contact form a unity. 
<A NAME="284"></A>And in whatever way that which holds them together is one, so too will 
<A NAME="285"></A>the whole be one, e.g. by a rivet or glue or contact or organic 
<A NAME="286"></A>union.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>It is obvious that of these terms 'in succession' is first in order 
<A NAME="288"></A>of analysis: for that which touches is necessarily in succession, but not 
<A NAME="289"></A>everything that is in succession touches: and so succession is a property 
<A NAME="290"></A>of things prior in definition, e.g. numbers, while contact is not. And 
<A NAME="291"></A>if there is continuity there is necessarily contact, but if there is contact, 
<A NAME="292"></A>that alone does not imply continuity: for the extremities of things may 
<A NAME="293"></A>be 'together' without necessarily being one: but they cannot be one without 
<A NAME="294"></A>being necessarily together. So natural junction is last in coming to be: 
<A NAME="295"></A>for the extremities must necessarily come into contact if they are to be 
<A NAME="296"></A>naturally joined: but things that are in contact are not all naturally 
<A NAME="297"></A>joined, while there is no contact clearly there is no natural junction 
<A NAME="298"></A>either. Hence, if as some say 'point' and 'unit' have an independent existence 
<A NAME="299"></A>of their own, it is impossible for the two to be identical: for points 
<A NAME="300"></A>can touch while units can only be in succession. Moreover, there can always 
<A NAME="301"></A>be something between points (for all lines are intermediate between points), 
<A NAME="302"></A>whereas it is not necessary that there should possibly be anything between 
<A NAME="303"></A>units: for there can be nothing between the numbers one and 
<A NAME="304"></A>two.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>We have now defined what is meant by 'together' and 'apart', 'contact', 
<A NAME="306"></A>'between' and 'in succession', 'contiguous' and 'continuous': and we have 
<A NAME="307"></A>shown in what circumstances each of these terms is applicable.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="308"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>There are many senses in which motion is said to be 'one': for 
<A NAME="310"></A>we use the term 'one' in many senses.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>Motion is one generically according to the different categories 
<A NAME="312"></A>to which it may be assigned: thus any locomotion is one generically with 
<A NAME="313"></A>any other locomotion, whereas alteration is different generically from 
<A NAME="314"></A>locomotion.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>Motion is one specifically when besides being one generically it 
<A NAME="316"></A>also takes place in a species incapable of subdivision: e.g. colour has 
<A NAME="317"></A>specific differences: therefore blackening and whitening differ specifically; 
<A NAME="318"></A>but at all events every whitening will be specifically the same with every 
<A NAME="319"></A>other whitening and every blackening with every other blackening. But white 
<A NAME="320"></A>is not further subdivided by specific differences: hence any whitening 
<A NAME="321"></A>is specifically one with any other whitening. Where it happens that the 
<A NAME="322"></A>genus is at the same time a species, it is clear that the motion will then 
<A NAME="323"></A>in a sense be one specifically though not in an unqualified sense: learning 
<A NAME="324"></A>is an example of this, knowledge being on the one hand a species of apprehension 
<A NAME="325"></A>and on the other hand a genus including the various knowledges. A difficulty, 
<A NAME="326"></A>however, may be raised as to whether a motion is specifically one when 
<A NAME="327"></A>the same thing changes from the same to the same, e.g. when one point changes 
<A NAME="328"></A>again and again from a particular place to a particular place: if this 
<A NAME="329"></A>motion is specifically one, circular motion will be the same as rectilinear 
<A NAME="330"></A>motion, and rolling the same as walking. But is not this difficulty removed 
<A NAME="331"></A>by the principle already laid down that if that in which the motion takes 
<A NAME="332"></A>place is specifically different (as in the present instance the circular 
<A NAME="333"></A>path is specifically different from the straight) the motion itself is 
<A NAME="334"></A>also different? We have explained, then, what is meant by saying that motion 
<A NAME="335"></A>is one generically or one specifically.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>Motion is one in an unqualified sense when it is one essentially 
<A NAME="337"></A>or numerically: and the following distinctions will make clear what this 
<A NAME="338"></A>kind of motion is. There are three classes of things in connexion with 
<A NAME="339"></A>which we speak of motion, the 'that which', the 'that in which', and the 
<A NAME="340"></A>'that during which'. I mean that there must he something that is in motion, 
<A NAME="341"></A>e.g. a man or gold, and it must be in motion in something, e.g. a place 
<A NAME="342"></A>or an affection, and during something, for all motion takes place during 
<A NAME="343"></A>a time. Of these three it is the thing in which the motion takes place 
<A NAME="344"></A>that makes it one generically or specifically, it is the thing moved that 
<A NAME="345"></A>makes the motion one in subject, and it is the time that makes it consecutive: 
<A NAME="346"></A>but it is the three together that make it one without qualification: to 
<A NAME="347"></A>effect this, that in which the motion takes place (the species) must be 
<A NAME="348"></A>one and incapable of subdivision, that during which it takes place (the 
<A NAME="349"></A>time) must be one and unintermittent, and that which is in motion must 
<A NAME="350"></A>be one-not in an accidental sense (i.e. it must be one as the white that 
<A NAME="351"></A>blackens is one or Coriscus who walks is one, not in the accidental sense 
<A NAME="352"></A>in which Coriscus and white may be one), nor merely in virtue of community 
<A NAME="353"></A>of nature (for there might be a case of two men being restored to health 
<A NAME="354"></A>at the same time in the same way, e.g. from inflammation of the eye, yet 
<A NAME="355"></A>this motion is not really one, but only specifically 
<A NAME="356"></A>one).
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>Suppose, however, that Socrates undergoes an alteration specifically 
<A NAME="358"></A>the same but at one time and again at another: in this case if it is possible 
<A NAME="359"></A>for that which ceased to be again to come into being and remain numerically 
<A NAME="360"></A>the same, then this motion too will be one: otherwise it will be the same 
<A NAME="361"></A>but not one. And akin to this difficulty there is another; viz. is health 
<A NAME="362"></A>one? and generally are the states and affections in bodies severally one 
<A NAME="363"></A>in essence although (as is clear) the things that contain them are obviously 
<A NAME="364"></A>in motion and in flux? Thus if a person's health at daybreak and at the 
<A NAME="365"></A>present moment is one and the same, why should not this health be numerically 
<A NAME="366"></A>one with that which he recovers after an interval? The same argument applies 
<A NAME="367"></A>in each case. There is, however, we may answer, this difference: that if 
<A NAME="368"></A>the states are two then it follows simply from this fact that the activities 
<A NAME="369"></A>must also in point of number be two (for only that which is numerically 
<A NAME="370"></A>one can give rise to an activity that is numerically one), but if the state 
<A NAME="371"></A>is one, this is not in itself enough to make us regard the activity also 
<A NAME="372"></A>as one: for when a man ceases walking, the walking no longer is, but it 
<A NAME="373"></A>will again be if he begins to walk again. But, be this as it may, if in 
<A NAME="374"></A>the above instance the health is one and the same, then it must be possible 
<A NAME="375"></A>for that which is one and the same to come to be and to cease to be many 
<A NAME="376"></A>times. However, these difficulties lie outside our present 
<A NAME="377"></A>inquiry.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>Since every motion is continuous, a motion that is one in an unqualified 
<A NAME="379"></A>sense must (since every motion is divisible) be continuous, and a continuous 
<A NAME="380"></A>motion must be one. There will not be continuity between any motion and 
<A NAME="381"></A>any other indiscriminately any more than there is between any two things 
<A NAME="382"></A>chosen at random in any other sphere: there can be continuity only when 
<A NAME="383"></A>the extremities of the two things are one. Now some things have no extremities 
<A NAME="384"></A>at all: and the extremities of others differ specifically although we give 
<A NAME="385"></A>them the same name of 'end': how should e.g. the 'end' of a line and the 
<A NAME="386"></A>'end' of walking touch or come to be one? Motions that are not the same 
<A NAME="387"></A>either specifically or generically may, it is true, be consecutive (e.g. 
<A NAME="388"></A>a man may run and then at once fall ill of a fever), and again, in the 
<A NAME="389"></A>torch-race we have consecutive but not continuous locomotion: for according 
<A NAME="390"></A>to our definition there can be continuity only when the ends of the two 
<A NAME="391"></A>things are one. Hence motions may be consecutive or successive in virtue 
<A NAME="392"></A>of the time being continuous, but there can be continuity only in virtue 
<A NAME="393"></A>of the motions themselves being continuous, that is when the end of each 
<A NAME="394"></A>is one with the end of the other. Motion, therefore, that is in an unqualified 
<A NAME="395"></A>sense continuous and one must be specifically the same, of one thing, and 
<A NAME="396"></A>in one time. Unity is required in respect of time in order that there may 
<A NAME="397"></A>be no interval of immobility, for where there is intermission of motion 
<A NAME="398"></A>there must be rest, and a motion that includes intervals of rest will be 
<A NAME="399"></A>not one but many, so that a motion that is interrupted by stationariness 
<A NAME="400"></A>is not one or continuous, and it is so interrupted if there is an interval 
<A NAME="401"></A>of time. And though of a motion that is not specifically one (even if the 
<A NAME="402"></A>time is unintermittent) the time is one, the motion is specifically different, 
<A NAME="403"></A>and so cannot really be one, for motion that is one must be specifically 
<A NAME="404"></A>one, though motion that is specifically one is not necessarily one in an 
<A NAME="405"></A>unqualified sense. We have now explained what we mean when we call a motion 
<A NAME="406"></A>one without qualification.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>Further, a motion is also said to be one generically, specifically, 
<A NAME="408"></A>or essentially when it is complete, just as in other cases completeness 
<A NAME="409"></A>and wholeness are characteristics of what is one: and sometimes a motion 
<A NAME="410"></A>even if incomplete is said to be one, provided only that it is 
<A NAME="411"></A>continuous.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>And besides the cases already mentioned there is another in which 
<A NAME="413"></A>a motion is said to be one, viz. when it is regular: for in a sense a motion 
<A NAME="414"></A>that is irregular is not regarded as one, that title belonging rather to 
<A NAME="415"></A>that which is regular, as a straight line is regular, the irregular being 
<A NAME="416"></A>as such divisible. But the difference would seem to be one of degree. In 
<A NAME="417"></A>every kind of motion we may have regularity or irregularity: thus there 
<A NAME="418"></A>may be regular alteration, and locomotion in a regular path, e.g. in a 
<A NAME="419"></A>circle or on a straight line, and it is the same with regard to increase 
<A NAME="420"></A>and decrease. The difference that makes a motion irregular is sometimes 
<A NAME="421"></A>to be found in its path: thus a motion cannot be regular if its path is 
<A NAME="422"></A>an irregular magnitude, e.g. a broken line, a spiral, or any other magnitude 
<A NAME="423"></A>that is not such that any part of it taken at random fits on to any other 
<A NAME="424"></A>that may be chosen. Sometimes it is found neither in the place nor in the 
<A NAME="425"></A>time nor in the goal but in the manner of the motion: for in some cases 
<A NAME="426"></A>the motion is differentiated by quickness and slowness: thus if its velocity 
<A NAME="427"></A>is uniform a motion is regular, if not it is irregular. So quickness and 
<A NAME="428"></A>slowness are not species of motion nor do they constitute specific differences 
<A NAME="429"></A>of motion, because this distinction occurs in connexion with all the distinct 
<A NAME="430"></A>species of motion. The same is true of heaviness and lightness when they 
<A NAME="431"></A>refer to the same thing: e.g. they do not specifically distinguish earth 
<A NAME="432"></A>from itself or fire from itself. Irregular motion, therefore, while in 
<A NAME="433"></A>virtue of being continuous it is one, is so in a lesser degree, as is the 
<A NAME="434"></A>case with locomotion in a broken line: and a lesser degree of something 
<A NAME="435"></A>always means an admixture of its contrary. And since every motion that 
<A NAME="436"></A>is one can be both regular and irregular, motions that are consecutive 
<A NAME="437"></A>but not specifically the same cannot be one and continuous: for how should 
<A NAME="438"></A>a motion composed of alteration and locomotion be regular? If a motion 
<A NAME="439"></A>is to be regular its parts ought to fit one another.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="440"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>We have further to determine what motions are contrary to each 
<A NAME="442"></A>other, and to determine similarly how it is with rest. And we have first 
<A NAME="443"></A>to decide whether contrary motions are motions respectively from and to 
<A NAME="444"></A>the same thing, e.g. a motion from health and a motion to health (where 
<A NAME="445"></A>the opposition, it would seem, is of the same kind as that between coming 
<A NAME="446"></A>to be and ceasing to be); or motions respectively from contraries, e.g. 
<A NAME="447"></A>a motion from health and a motion from disease; or motions respectively 
<A NAME="448"></A>to contraries, e.g. a motion to health and a motion to disease; or motions 
<A NAME="449"></A>respectively from a contrary and to the opposite contrary, e.g. a motion 
<A NAME="450"></A>from health and a motion to disease; or motions respectively from a contrary 
<A NAME="451"></A>to the opposite contrary and from the latter to the former, e.g. a motion 
<A NAME="452"></A>from health to disease and a motion from disease to health: for motions 
<A NAME="453"></A>must be contrary to one another in one or more of these ways, as there 
<A NAME="454"></A>is no other way in which they can be opposed.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>Now motions respectively from a contrary and to the opposite contrary, 
<A NAME="456"></A>e.g. a motion from health and a motion to disease, are not contrary motions: 
<A NAME="457"></A>for they are one and the same. (Yet their essence is not the same, just 
<A NAME="458"></A>as changing from health is different from changing to disease.) Nor are 
<A NAME="459"></A>motion respectively from a contrary and from the opposite contrary contrary 
<A NAME="460"></A>motions, for a motion from a contrary is at the same time a motion to a 
<A NAME="461"></A>contrary or to an intermediate (of this, however, we shall speak later), 
<A NAME="462"></A>but changing to a contrary rather than changing from a contrary would seem 
<A NAME="463"></A>to be the cause of the contrariety of motions, the latter being the loss, 
<A NAME="464"></A>the former the gain, of contrariness. Moreover, each several motion takes 
<A NAME="465"></A>its name rather from the goal than from the starting-point of change, e.g. 
<A NAME="466"></A>motion to health we call convalescence, motion to disease sickening. Thus 
<A NAME="467"></A>we are left with motions respectively to contraries, and motions respectively 
<A NAME="468"></A>to contraries from the opposite contraries. Now it would seem that motions 
<A NAME="469"></A>to contraries are at the same time motions from contraries (though their 
<A NAME="470"></A>essence may not be the same; 'to health' is distinct, I mean, from 'from 
<A NAME="471"></A>disease', and 'from health' from 'to disease').
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>Since then change differs from motion (motion being change from 
<A NAME="473"></A>a particular subject to a particular subject), it follows that contrary 
<A NAME="474"></A>motions are motions respectively from a contrary to the opposite contrary 
<A NAME="475"></A>and from the latter to the former, e.g. a motion from health to disease 
<A NAME="476"></A>and a motion from disease to health. Moreover, the consideration of particular 
<A NAME="477"></A>examples will also show what kinds of processes are generally recognized 
<A NAME="478"></A>as contrary: thus falling ill is regarded as contrary to recovering one's 
<A NAME="479"></A>health, these processes having contrary goals, and being taught as contrary 
<A NAME="480"></A>to being led into error by another, it being possible to acquire error, 
<A NAME="481"></A>like knowledge, either by one's own agency or by that of another. Similarly 
<A NAME="482"></A>we have upward locomotion and downward locomotion, which are contrary lengthwise, 
<A NAME="483"></A>locomotion to the right and locomotion to the left, which are contrary 
<A NAME="484"></A>breadthwise, and forward locomotion and backward locomotion, which too 
<A NAME="485"></A>are contraries. On the other hand, a process simply to a contrary, e.g. 
<A NAME="486"></A>that denoted by the expression 'becoming white', where no starting-point 
<A NAME="487"></A>is specified, is a change but not a motion. And in all cases of a thing 
<A NAME="488"></A>that has no contrary we have as contraries change from and change to the 
<A NAME="489"></A>same thing. Thus coming to be is contrary to ceasing to be, and losing 
<A NAME="490"></A>to gaining. But these are changes and not motions. And wherever a pair 
<A NAME="491"></A>of contraries admit of an intermediate, motions to that intermediate must 
<A NAME="492"></A>be held to be in a sense motions to one or other of the contraries: for 
<A NAME="493"></A>the intermediate serves as a contrary for the purposes of the motion, in 
<A NAME="494"></A>whichever direction the change may be, e.g. grey in a motion from grey 
<A NAME="495"></A>to white takes the place of black as starting-point, in a motion from white 
<A NAME="496"></A>to grey it takes the place of black as goal, and in a motion from black 
<A NAME="497"></A>to grey it takes the place of white as goal: for the middle is opposed 
<A NAME="498"></A>in a sense to either of the extremes, as has been said above. Thus we see 
<A NAME="499"></A>that two motions are contrary to each other only when one is a motion from 
<A NAME="500"></A>a contrary to the opposite contrary and the other is a motion from the 
<A NAME="501"></A>latter to the former.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="502"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR>But since a motion appears to have contrary to it not only another 
<A NAME="504"></A>motion but also a state of rest, we must determine how this is so. A motion 
<A NAME="505"></A>has for its contrary in the strict sense of the term another motion, but 
<A NAME="506"></A>it also has for an opposite a state of rest (for rest is the privation 
<A NAME="507"></A>of motion and the privation of anything may be called its contrary), and 
<A NAME="508"></A>motion of one kind has for its opposite rest of that kind, e.g. local motion 
<A NAME="509"></A>has local rest. This statement, however, needs further qualification: there 
<A NAME="510"></A>remains the question, is the opposite of remaining at a particular place 
<A NAME="511"></A>motion from or motion to that place? It is surely clear that since there 
<A NAME="512"></A>are two subjects between which motion takes place, motion from one of these 
<A NAME="513"></A>(A) to its contrary (B) has for its opposite remaining in A while the reverse 
<A NAME="514"></A>motion has for its opposite remaining in B. At the same time these two 
<A NAME="515"></A>are also contrary to each other: for it would be absurd to suppose that 
<A NAME="516"></A>there are contrary motions and not opposite states of rest. States of rest 
<A NAME="517"></A>in contraries are opposed. To take an example, a state of rest in health 
<A NAME="518"></A>is (1) contrary to a state of rest in disease, and (2) the motion to which 
<A NAME="519"></A>it is contrary is that from health to disease. For (2) it would be absurd 
<A NAME="520"></A>that its contrary motion should be that from disease to health, since motion 
<A NAME="521"></A>to that in which a thing is at rest is rather a coming to rest, the coming 
<A NAME="522"></A>to rest being found to come into being simultaneously with the motion; 
<A NAME="523"></A>and one of these two motions it must be. And (1) rest in whiteness is of 
<A NAME="524"></A>course not contrary to rest in health.
<A NAME="525"></A><BR><BR>Of all things that have no contraries there are opposite changes 
<A NAME="526"></A>(viz. change from the thing and change to the thing, e.g. change from being 
<A NAME="527"></A>and change to being), but no motion. So, too, of such things there is no 
<A NAME="528"></A>remaining though there is absence of change. Should there be a particular 
<A NAME="529"></A>subject, absence of change in its being will be contrary to absence of 
<A NAME="530"></A>change in its not-being. And here a difficulty may be raised: if not-being 
<A NAME="531"></A>is not a particular something, what is it, it may be asked, that is contrary 
<A NAME="532"></A>to absence of change in a thing's being? and is this absence of change 
<A NAME="533"></A>a state of rest? If it is, then either it is not true that every state 
<A NAME="534"></A>of rest is contrary to a motion or else coming to be and ceasing to be 
<A NAME="535"></A>are motion. It is clear then that, since we exclude these from among motions, 
<A NAME="536"></A>we must not say that this absence of change is a state of rest: we must 
<A NAME="537"></A>say that it is similar to a state of rest and call it absence of change. 
<A NAME="538"></A>And it will have for its contrary either nothing or absence of change in 
<A NAME="539"></A>the thing's not-being, or the ceasing to be of the thing: for such ceasing 
<A NAME="540"></A>to be is change from it and the thing's coming to be is change to 
<A NAME="541"></A>it.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>Again, a further difficulty may be raised. How is it, it may be 
<A NAME="543"></A>asked, that whereas in local change both remaining and moving may be natural 
<A NAME="544"></A>or unnatural, in the other changes this is not so? e.g. alteration is not 
<A NAME="545"></A>now natural and now unnatural, for convalescence is no more natural or 
<A NAME="546"></A>unnatural than falling ill, whitening no more natural or unnatural than 
<A NAME="547"></A>blackening; so, too, with increase and decrease: these are not contrary 
<A NAME="548"></A>to each other in the sense that either of them is natural while the other 
<A NAME="549"></A>is unnatural, nor is one increase contrary to another in this sense; and 
<A NAME="550"></A>the same account may be given of becoming and perishing: it is not true 
<A NAME="551"></A>that becoming is natural and perishing unnatural (for growing old is natural), 
<A NAME="552"></A>nor do we observe one becoming to be natural and another unnatural. We 
<A NAME="553"></A>answer that if what happens under violence is unnatural, then violent perishing 
<A NAME="554"></A>is unnatural and as such contrary to natural perishing. Are there then 
<A NAME="555"></A>also some becomings that are violent and not the result of natural necessity, 
<A NAME="556"></A>and are therefore contrary to natural becomings, and violent increases 
<A NAME="557"></A>and decreases, e.g. the rapid growth to maturity of profligates and the 
<A NAME="558"></A>rapid ripening of seeds even when not packed close in the earth? And how 
<A NAME="559"></A>is it with alterations? Surely just the same: we may say that some alterations 
<A NAME="560"></A>are violent while others are natural, e.g. patients alter naturally or 
<A NAME="561"></A>unnaturally according as they throw off fevers on the critical days or 
<A NAME="562"></A>not. But, it may be objected, then we shall have perishings contrary to 
<A NAME="563"></A>one another, not to becoming. Certainly: and why should not this in a sense 
<A NAME="564"></A>be so? Thus it is so if one perishing is pleasant and another painful: 
<A NAME="565"></A>and so one perishing will be contrary to another not in an unqualified 
<A NAME="566"></A>sense, but in so far as one has this quality and the other 
<A NAME="567"></A>that.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>Now motions and states of rest universally exhibit contrariety 
<A NAME="569"></A>in the manner described above, e.g. upward motion and rest above are respectively 
<A NAME="570"></A>contrary to downward motion and rest below, these being instances of local 
<A NAME="571"></A>contrariety; and upward locomotion belongs naturally to fire and downward 
<A NAME="572"></A>to earth, i.e. the locomotions of the two are contrary to each other. And 
<A NAME="573"></A>again, fire moves up naturally and down unnaturally: and its natural motion 
<A NAME="574"></A>is certainly contrary to its unnatural motion. Similarly with remaining: 
<A NAME="575"></A>remaining above is contrary to motion from above downwards, and to earth 
<A NAME="576"></A>this remaining comes unnaturally, this motion naturally. So the unnatural 
<A NAME="577"></A>remaining of a thing is contrary to its natural motion, just as we find 
<A NAME="578"></A>a similar contrariety in the motion of the same thing: one of its motions, 
<A NAME="579"></A>the upward or the downward, will be natural, the other 
<A NAME="580"></A>unnatural.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR>Here, however, the question arises, has every state of rest that 
<A NAME="582"></A>is not permanent a becoming, and is this becoming a coming to a standstill? 
<A NAME="583"></A>If so, there must be a becoming of that which is at rest unnaturally, e.g. 
<A NAME="584"></A>of earth at rest above: and therefore this earth during the time that it 
<A NAME="585"></A>was being carried violently upward was coming to a standstill. But whereas 
<A NAME="586"></A>the velocity of that which comes to a standstill seems always to increase, 
<A NAME="587"></A>the velocity of that which is carried violently seems always to decrease: 
<A NAME="588"></A>so it will he in a state of rest without having become so. Moreover 'coming 
<A NAME="589"></A>to a standstill' is generally recognized to be identical or at least concomitant 
<A NAME="590"></A>with the locomotion of a thing to its proper place.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR>There is also another difficulty involved in the view that remaining 
<A NAME="592"></A>in a particular place is contrary to motion from that place. For when a 
<A NAME="593"></A>thing is moving from or discarding something, it still appears to have 
<A NAME="594"></A>that which is being discarded, so that if a state of rest is itself contrary 
<A NAME="595"></A>to the motion from the state of rest to its contrary, the contraries rest 
<A NAME="596"></A>and motion will be simultaneously predicable of the same thing. May we 
<A NAME="597"></A>not say, however, that in so far as the thing is still stationary it is 
<A NAME="598"></A>in a state of rest in a qualified sense? For, in fact, whenever a thing 
<A NAME="599"></A>is in motion, part of it is at the starting-point while part is at the 
<A NAME="600"></A>goal to which it is changing: and consequently a motion finds its true 
<A NAME="601"></A>contrary rather in another motion than in a state of 
<A NAME="602"></A>rest.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>With regard to motion and rest, then, we have now explained in 
<A NAME="604"></A>what sense each of them is one and under what conditions they exhibit 
<A NAME="605"></A>contrariety.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR>[With regard to coming to a standstill the question may be raised 
<A NAME="607"></A>whether there is an opposite state of rest to unnatural as well as to natural 
<A NAME="608"></A>motions. It would be absurd if this were not the case: for a thing may 
<A NAME="609"></A>remain still merely under violence: thus we shall have a thing being in 
<A NAME="610"></A>a non-permanent state of rest without having become so. But it is clear 
<A NAME="611"></A>that it must be the case: for just as there is unnatural motion, so, too, 
<A NAME="612"></A>a thing may be in an unnatural state of rest. Further, some things have 
<A NAME="613"></A>a natural and an unnatural motion, e.g. fire has a natural upward motion 
<A NAME="614"></A>and an unnatural downward motion: is it, then, this unnatural downward 
<A NAME="615"></A>motion or is it the natural downward motion of earth that is contrary to 
<A NAME="616"></A>the natural upward motion? Surely it is clear that both are contrary to 
<A NAME="617"></A>it though not in the same sense: the natural motion of earth is contrary 
<A NAME="618"></A>inasmuch as the motion of fire is also natural, whereas the upward motion 
<A NAME="619"></A>of fire as being natural is contrary to the downward motion of fire as 
<A NAME="620"></A>being unnatural. The same is true of the corresponding cases of remaining. 
<A NAME="621"></A>But there would seem to be a sense in which a state of rest and a motion 
<A NAME="622"></A>are opposites.]
