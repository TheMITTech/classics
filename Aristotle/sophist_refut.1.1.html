<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Let us now discuss sophistic refutations, i.e. what appear to be refutations 
<A NAME="12"></A>but are really fallacies instead. We will begin in the natural order with 
<A NAME="13"></A>the first.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>That some reasonings are genuine, while others seem to be so but 
<A NAME="15"></A>are not, is evident. This happens with arguments, as also elsewhere, through 
<A NAME="16"></A>a certain likeness between the genuine and the sham. For physically some 
<A NAME="17"></A>people are in a vigorous condition, while others merely seem to be so by 
<A NAME="18"></A>blowing and rigging themselves out as the tribesmen do their victims for 
<A NAME="19"></A>sacrifice; and some people are beautiful thanks to their beauty, while 
<A NAME="20"></A>others seem to be so, by dint of embellishing themselves. So it is, too, 
<A NAME="21"></A>with inanimate things; for of these, too, some are really silver and others 
<A NAME="22"></A>gold, while others are not and merely seem to be such to our sense; e.g. 
<A NAME="23"></A>things made of litharge and tin seem to be of silver, while those made 
<A NAME="24"></A>of yellow metal look golden. In the same way both reasoning and refutation 
<A NAME="25"></A>are sometimes genuine, sometimes not, though inexperience may make them 
<A NAME="26"></A>appear so: for inexperienced people obtain only, as it were, a distant 
<A NAME="27"></A>view of these things. For reasoning rests on certain statements such that 
<A NAME="28"></A>they involve necessarily the assertion of something other than what has 
<A NAME="29"></A>been stated, through what has been stated: refutation is reasoning involving 
<A NAME="30"></A>the contradictory of the given conclusion. Now some of them do not really 
<A NAME="31"></A>achieve this, though they seem to do so for a number of reasons; and of 
<A NAME="32"></A>these the most prolific and usual domain is the argument that turns upon 
<A NAME="33"></A>names only. It is impossible in a discussion to bring in the actual things 
<A NAME="34"></A>discussed: we use their names as symbols instead of them; and therefore 
<A NAME="35"></A>we suppose that what follows in the names, follows in the things as well, 
<A NAME="36"></A>just as people who calculate suppose in regard to their counters. But the 
<A NAME="37"></A>two cases (names and things) are not alike. For names are finite and so 
<A NAME="38"></A>is the sum-total of formulae, while things are infinite in number. Inevitably, 
<A NAME="39"></A>then, the same formulae, and a single name, have a number of meanings. 
<A NAME="40"></A>Accordingly just as, in counting, those who are not clever in manipulating 
<A NAME="41"></A>their counters are taken in by the experts, in the same way in arguments 
<A NAME="42"></A>too those who are not well acquainted with the force of names misreason 
<A NAME="43"></A>both in their own discussions and when they listen to others. For this 
<A NAME="44"></A>reason, then, and for others to be mentioned later, there exists both reasoning 
<A NAME="45"></A>and refutation that is apparent but not real. Now for some people it is 
<A NAME="46"></A>better worth while to seem to be wise, than to be wise without seeming 
<A NAME="47"></A>to be (for the art of the sophist is the semblance of wisdom without the 
<A NAME="48"></A>reality, and the sophist is one who makes money from an apparent but unreal 
<A NAME="49"></A>wisdom); for them, then, it is clearly essential also to seem to accomplish 
<A NAME="50"></A>the task of a wise man rather than to accomplish it without seeming to 
<A NAME="51"></A>do so. To reduce it to a single point of contrast it is the business of 
<A NAME="52"></A>one who knows a thing, himself to avoid fallacies in the subjects which 
<A NAME="53"></A>he knows and to be able to show up the man who makes them; and of these 
<A NAME="54"></A>accomplishments the one depends on the faculty to render an answer, and 
<A NAME="55"></A>the other upon the securing of one. Those, then, who would be sophists 
<A NAME="56"></A>are bound to study the class of arguments aforesaid: for it is worth their 
<A NAME="57"></A>while: for a faculty of this kind will make a man seem to be wise, and 
<A NAME="58"></A>this is the purpose they happen to have in view.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>Clearly, then, there exists a class of arguments of this kind, 
<A NAME="60"></A>and it is at this kind of ability that those aim whom we call sophists. 
<A NAME="61"></A>Let us now go on to discuss how many kinds there are of sophistical arguments, 
<A NAME="62"></A>and how many in number are the elements of which this faculty is composed, 
<A NAME="63"></A>and how many branches there happen to be of this inquiry, and the other 
<A NAME="64"></A>factors that contribute to this art.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="65"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>Of arguments in dialogue form there are four 
<A NAME="67"></A>classes:
<A NAME="68"></A><BR>Didactic, Dialectical, Examination-arguments, and Contentious arguments. 
<A NAME="69"></A>Didactic arguments are those that reason from the principles appropriate 
<A NAME="70"></A>to each subject and not from the opinions held by the answerer (for the 
<A NAME="71"></A>learner should take things on trust): dialectical arguments are those that 
<A NAME="72"></A>reason from premisses generally accepted, to the contradictory of a given 
<A NAME="73"></A>thesis: examination-arguments are those that reason from premisses which 
<A NAME="74"></A>are accepted by the answerer and which any one who pretends to possess 
<A NAME="75"></A>knowledge of the subject is bound to know-in what manner, has been defined 
<A NAME="76"></A>in another treatise: contentious arguments are those that reason or appear 
<A NAME="77"></A>to reason to a conclusion from premisses that appear to be generally accepted 
<A NAME="78"></A>but are not so. The subject, then, of demonstrative arguments has been 
<A NAME="79"></A>discussed in the Analytics, while that of dialectic arguments and examination-arguments 
<A NAME="80"></A>has been discussed elsewhere: let us now proceed to speak of the arguments 
<A NAME="81"></A>used in competitions and contests.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="82"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>First we must grasp the number of aims entertained by those who 
<A NAME="84"></A>argue as competitors and rivals to the death. These are five in number, 
<A NAME="85"></A>refutation, fallacy, paradox, solecism, and fifthly to reduce the opponent 
<A NAME="86"></A>in the discussion to babbling-i.e. to constrain him to repeat himself a 
<A NAME="87"></A>number of times: or it is to produce the appearance of each of these things 
<A NAME="88"></A>without the reality. For they choose if possible plainly to refute the 
<A NAME="89"></A>other party, or as the second best to show that he is committing some fallacy, 
<A NAME="90"></A>or as a third best to lead him into paradox, or fourthly to reduce him 
<A NAME="91"></A>to solecism, i.e. to make the answerer, in consequence of the argument, 
<A NAME="92"></A>to use an ungrammatical expression; or, as a last resort, to make him repeat 
<A NAME="93"></A>himself.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="94"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>There are two styles of refutation: for some depend on the language 
<A NAME="96"></A>used, while some are independent of language. Those ways of producing the 
<A NAME="97"></A>false appearance of an argument which depend on language are six in number: 
<A NAME="98"></A>they are ambiguity, amphiboly, combination, division of words, accent, 
<A NAME="99"></A>form of expression. Of this we may assure ourselves both by induction, 
<A NAME="100"></A>and by syllogistic proof based on this-and it may be on other assumptions 
<A NAME="101"></A>as well-that this is the number of ways in which we might fall to mean 
<A NAME="102"></A>the same thing by the same names or expressions. Arguments such as the 
<A NAME="103"></A>following depend upon ambiguity. 'Those learn who know: for it is those 
<A NAME="104"></A>who know their letters who learn the letters dictated to them'. For to 
<A NAME="105"></A>'learn' is ambiguous; it signifies both 'to understand' by the use of knowledge, 
<A NAME="106"></A>and also 'to acquire knowledge'. Again, 'Evils are good: for what needs 
<A NAME="107"></A>to be is good, and evils must needs be'. For 'what needs to be' has a double 
<A NAME="108"></A>meaning: it means what is inevitable, as often is the case with evils, 
<A NAME="109"></A>too (for evil of some kind is inevitable), while on the other hand we say 
<A NAME="110"></A>of good things as well that they 'need to be'. Moreover, 'The same man 
<A NAME="111"></A>is both seated and standing and he is both sick and in health: for it is 
<A NAME="112"></A>he who stood up who is standing, and he who is recovering who is in health: 
<A NAME="113"></A>but it is the seated man who stood up, and the sick man who was recovering'. 
<A NAME="114"></A>For 'The sick man does so and so', or 'has so and so done to him' is not 
<A NAME="115"></A>single in meaning: sometimes it means 'the man who is sick or is seated 
<A NAME="116"></A>now', sometimes 'the man who was sick formerly'. Of course, the man who 
<A NAME="117"></A>was recovering was the sick man, who really was sick at the time: but the 
<A NAME="118"></A>man who is in health is not sick at the same time: he is 'the sick man' 
<A NAME="119"></A>in the sense not that he is sick now, but that he was sick formerly. Examples 
<A NAME="120"></A>such as the following depend upon amphiboly: 'I wish that you the enemy 
<A NAME="121"></A>may capture'. Also the thesis, 'There must be knowledge of what one knows': 
<A NAME="122"></A>for it is possible by this phrase to mean that knowledge belongs to both 
<A NAME="123"></A>the knower and the known. Also, 'There must be sight of what one sees: 
<A NAME="124"></A>one sees the pillar: ergo the pillar has sight'. Also, 'What you profess 
<A NAME="125"></A>to-be, that you profess to-be: you profess a stone to-be: ergo you profess-to-be 
<A NAME="126"></A>a stone'. Also, 'Speaking of the silent is possible': for 'speaking of 
<A NAME="127"></A>the silent' also has a double meaning: it may mean that the speaker is 
<A NAME="128"></A>silent or that the things of which he speaks are so. There are three varieties 
<A NAME="129"></A>of these ambiguities and amphibolies: (1) When either the expression or 
<A NAME="130"></A>the name has strictly more than one meaning, e.g. aetos and the 'dog'; 
<A NAME="131"></A>(2) when by custom we use them so; (3) when words that have a simple sense 
<A NAME="132"></A>taken alone have more than one meaning in combination; e.g. 'knowing letters'. 
<A NAME="133"></A>For each word, both 'knowing' and 'letters', possibly has a single meaning: 
<A NAME="134"></A>but both together have more than one-either that the letters themselves 
<A NAME="135"></A>have knowledge or that someone else has it of them.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>Amphiboly and ambiguity, then, depend on these modes of speech. 
<A NAME="137"></A>Upon the combination of words there depend instances such as the following: 
<A NAME="138"></A>'A man can walk while sitting, and can write while not writing'. For the 
<A NAME="139"></A>meaning is not the same if one divides the words and if one combines them 
<A NAME="140"></A>in saying that 'it is possible to walk-while-sitting' and write while not 
<A NAME="141"></A>writing]. The same applies to the latter phrase, too, if one combines the 
<A NAME="142"></A>words 'to write-while-not-writing': for then it means that he has the power 
<A NAME="143"></A>to write and not to write at once; whereas if one does not combine them, 
<A NAME="144"></A>it means that when he is not writing he has the power to write. Also, 'He 
<A NAME="145"></A>now if he has learnt his letters'. Moreover, there is the saying that 'One 
<A NAME="146"></A>single thing if you can carry a crowd you can carry 
<A NAME="147"></A>too'.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>Upon division depend the propositions that 5 is 2 and 3, and odd, 
<A NAME="149"></A>and that the greater is equal: for it is that amount and more besides. 
<A NAME="150"></A>For the same phrase would not be thought always to have the same meaning 
<A NAME="151"></A>when divided and when combined, e.g. 'I made thee a slave once a free man', 
<A NAME="152"></A>and 'God-like Achilles left fifty a hundred men'.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>An argument depending upon accent it is not easy to construct in 
<A NAME="154"></A>unwritten discussion; in written discussions and in poetry it is easier. 
<A NAME="155"></A>Thus (e.g.) some people emend Homer against those who criticize as unnatural 
<A NAME="156"></A>his expression to men ou kataputhetai ombro. For they solve the difficulty 
<A NAME="157"></A>by a change of accent, pronouncing the ou with an acuter accent. Also, 
<A NAME="158"></A>in the passage about Agamemnon's dream, they say that Zeus did not himself 
<A NAME="159"></A>say 'We grant him the fulfilment of his prayer', but that he bade the dream 
<A NAME="160"></A>grant it. Instances such as these, then, turn upon the 
<A NAME="161"></A>accentuation.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>Others come about owing to the form of expression used, when what 
<A NAME="163"></A>is really different is expressed in the same form, e.g. a masculine thing 
<A NAME="164"></A>by a feminine termination, or a feminine thing by a masculine, or a neuter 
<A NAME="165"></A>by either a masculine or a feminine; or, again, when a quality is expressed 
<A NAME="166"></A>by a termination proper to quantity or vice versa, or what is active by 
<A NAME="167"></A>a passive word, or a state by an active word, and so forth with the other 
<A NAME="168"></A>divisions previously' laid down. For it is possible to use an expression 
<A NAME="169"></A>to denote what does not belong to the class of actions at all as though 
<A NAME="170"></A>it did so belong. Thus (e.g.) 'flourishing' is a word which in the form 
<A NAME="171"></A>of its expression is like 'cutting' or 'building': yet the one denotes 
<A NAME="172"></A>a certain quality-i.e. a certain condition-while the other denotes a certain 
<A NAME="173"></A>action. In the same manner also in the other instances.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>Refutations, then, that depend upon language are drawn from these 
<A NAME="175"></A>common-place rules. Of fallacies, on the other hand, that are independent 
<A NAME="176"></A>of language there are seven kinds:
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>(1) that which depends upon Accident:
<A NAME="178"></A><BR>(2) the use of an expression absolutely or not absolutely but with 
<A NAME="179"></A>some qualification of respect or place, or time, or 
<A NAME="180"></A>relation:
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>(3) that which depends upon ignorance of what 'refutation' 
<A NAME="182"></A>is:
<A NAME="183"></A><BR>(4) that which depends upon the consequent:
<A NAME="184"></A><BR>(5) that which depends upon assuming the original 
<A NAME="185"></A>conclusion:
<A NAME="186"></A><BR>(6) stating as cause what is not the cause:
<A NAME="187"></A><BR>(7) the making of more than one question into one.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="188"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>Fallacies, then, that depend on Accident occur whenever any attribute 
<A NAME="190"></A>is claimed to belong in like manner to a thing and to its accident. For 
<A NAME="191"></A>since the same thing has many accidents there is no necessity that all 
<A NAME="192"></A>the same attributes should belong to all of a thing's predicates and to 
<A NAME="193"></A>their subject as well. Thus (e.g.), 'If Coriscus be different from "man", 
<A NAME="194"></A>he is different from himself: for he is a man': or 'If he be different 
<A NAME="195"></A>from Socrates, and Socrates be a man, then', they say, 'he has admitted 
<A NAME="196"></A>that Coriscus is different from a man, because it so happens (accidit) 
<A NAME="197"></A>that the person from whom he said that he (Coriscus) is different is a 
<A NAME="198"></A>man'.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>Those that depend on whether an expression is used absolutely or 
<A NAME="200"></A>in a certain respect and not strictly, occur whenever an expression used 
<A NAME="201"></A>in a particular sense is taken as though it were used absolutely, e.g. 
<A NAME="202"></A>in the argument 'If what is not is the object of an opinion, then what 
<A NAME="203"></A>is not is': for it is not the same thing 'to be x' and 'to be' absolutely. 
<A NAME="204"></A>Or again, 'What is, is not, if it is not a particular kind of being, e.g. 
<A NAME="205"></A>if it is not a man.' For it is not the same thing 'not to be x' and 'not 
<A NAME="206"></A>to be' at all: it looks as if it were, because of the closeness of the 
<A NAME="207"></A>expression, i.e. because 'to be x' is but little different from 'to be', 
<A NAME="208"></A>and 'not to be x' from 'not to be'. Likewise also with any argument that 
<A NAME="209"></A>turns upon the point whether an expression is used in a certain respect 
<A NAME="210"></A>or used absolutely. Thus e.g. 'Suppose an Indian to be black all over, 
<A NAME="211"></A>but white in respect of his teeth; then he is both white and not white.' 
<A NAME="212"></A>Or if both characters belong in a particular respect, then, they say, 'contrary 
<A NAME="213"></A>attributes belong at the same time'. This kind of thing is in some cases 
<A NAME="214"></A>easily seen by any one, e.g. suppose a man were to secure the statement 
<A NAME="215"></A>that the Ethiopian is black, and were then to ask whether he is white in 
<A NAME="216"></A>respect of his teeth; and then, if he be white in that respect, were to 
<A NAME="217"></A>suppose at the conclusion of his questions that therefore he had proved 
<A NAME="218"></A>dialectically that he was both white and not white. But in some cases it 
<A NAME="219"></A>often passes undetected, viz. in all cases where, whenever a statement 
<A NAME="220"></A>is made of something in a certain respect, it would be generally thought 
<A NAME="221"></A>that the absolute statement follows as well; and also in all cases where 
<A NAME="222"></A>it is not easy to see which of the attributes ought to be rendered strictly. 
<A NAME="223"></A>A situation of this kind arises, where both the opposite attributes belong 
<A NAME="224"></A>alike: for then there is general support for the view that one must agree 
<A NAME="225"></A>absolutely to the assertion of both, or of neither: e.g. if a thing is 
<A NAME="226"></A>half white and half black, is it white or black?
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>Other fallacies occur because the terms 'proof' or 'refutation' 
<A NAME="228"></A>have not been defined, and because something is left out in their definition. 
<A NAME="229"></A>For to refute is to contradict one and the same attribute-not merely the 
<A NAME="230"></A>name, but the reality-and a name that is not merely synonymous but the 
<A NAME="231"></A>same name-and to confute it from the propositions granted, necessarily, 
<A NAME="232"></A>without including in the reckoning the original point to be proved, in 
<A NAME="233"></A>the same respect and relation and manner and time in which it was asserted. 
<A NAME="234"></A>A 'false assertion' about anything has to be defined in the same way. Some 
<A NAME="235"></A>people, however, omit some one of the said conditions and give a merely 
<A NAME="236"></A>apparent refutation, showing (e.g.) that the same thing is both double 
<A NAME="237"></A>and not double: for two is double of one, but not double of three. Or, 
<A NAME="238"></A>it may be, they show that it is both double and not double of the same 
<A NAME="239"></A>thing, but not that it is so in the same respect: for it is double in length 
<A NAME="240"></A>but not double in breadth. Or, it may be, they show it to be both double 
<A NAME="241"></A>and not double of the same thing and in the same respect and manner, but 
<A NAME="242"></A>not that it is so at the same time: and therefore their refutation is merely 
<A NAME="243"></A>apparent. One might, with some violence, bring this fallacy into the group 
<A NAME="244"></A>of fallacies dependent on language as well.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>Those that depend on the assumption of the original point to be 
<A NAME="246"></A>proved, occur in the same way, and in as many ways, as it is possible to 
<A NAME="247"></A>beg the original point; they appear to refute because men lack the power 
<A NAME="248"></A>to keep their eyes at once upon what is the same and what is 
<A NAME="249"></A>different.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>The refutation which depends upon the consequent arises because 
<A NAME="251"></A>people suppose that the relation of consequence is convertible. For whenever, 
<A NAME="252"></A>suppose A is, B necessarily is, they then suppose also that if B is, A 
<A NAME="253"></A>necessarily is. This is also the source of the deceptions that attend opinions 
<A NAME="254"></A>based on sense-perception. For people often suppose bile to be honey because 
<A NAME="255"></A>honey is attended by a yellow colour: also, since after rain the ground 
<A NAME="256"></A>is wet in consequence, we suppose that if the ground is wet, it has been 
<A NAME="257"></A>raining; whereas that does not necessarily follow. In rhetoric proofs from 
<A NAME="258"></A>signs are based on consequences. For when rhetoricians wish to show that 
<A NAME="259"></A>a man is an adulterer, they take hold of some consequence of an adulterous 
<A NAME="260"></A>life, viz. that the man is smartly dressed, or that he is observed to wander 
<A NAME="261"></A>about at night. There are, however, many people of whom these things are 
<A NAME="262"></A>true, while the charge in question is untrue. It happens like this also 
<A NAME="263"></A>in real reasoning; e.g. Melissus' argument, that the universe is eternal, 
<A NAME="264"></A>assumes that the universe has not come to be (for from what is not nothing 
<A NAME="265"></A>could possibly come to be) and that what has come to be has done so from 
<A NAME="266"></A>a first beginning. If, therefore, the universe has not come to be, it has 
<A NAME="267"></A>no first beginning, and is therefore eternal. But this does not necessarily 
<A NAME="268"></A>follow: for even if what has come to be always has a first beginning, it 
<A NAME="269"></A>does not also follow that what has a first beginning has come to be; any 
<A NAME="270"></A>more than it follows that if a man in a fever be hot, a man who is hot 
<A NAME="271"></A>must be in a fever.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>The refutation which depends upon treating as cause what is not 
<A NAME="273"></A>a cause, occurs whenever what is not a cause is inserted in the argument, 
<A NAME="274"></A>as though the refutation depended upon it. This kind of thing happens in 
<A NAME="275"></A>arguments that reason ad impossible: for in these we are bound to demolish 
<A NAME="276"></A>one of the premisses. If, then, the false cause be reckoned in among the 
<A NAME="277"></A>questions that are necessary to establish the resulting impossibility, 
<A NAME="278"></A>it will often be thought that the refutation depends upon it, e.g. in the 
<A NAME="279"></A>proof that the 'soul' and 'life' are not the same: for if coming-to-be 
<A NAME="280"></A>be contrary to perishing, then a particular form of perishing will have 
<A NAME="281"></A>a particular form of coming-to-be as its contrary: now death is a particular 
<A NAME="282"></A>form of perishing and is contrary to life: life, therefore, is a coming 
<A NAME="283"></A>to-be, and to live is to come-to-be. But this is impossible: accordingly, 
<A NAME="284"></A>the 'soul' and 'life' are not the same. Now this is not proved: for the 
<A NAME="285"></A>impossibility results all the same, even if one does not say that life 
<A NAME="286"></A>is the same as the soul, but merely says that life is contrary to death, 
<A NAME="287"></A>which is a form of perishing, and that perishing has 'coming-to-be' as 
<A NAME="288"></A>its contrary. Arguments of that kind, then, though not inconclusive absolutely, 
<A NAME="289"></A>are inconclusive in relation to the proposed conclusion. Also even the 
<A NAME="290"></A>questioners themselves often fail quite as much to see a point of that 
<A NAME="291"></A>kind.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>Such, then, are the arguments that depend upon the consequent and 
<A NAME="293"></A>upon false cause. Those that depend upon the making of two questions into 
<A NAME="294"></A>one occur whenever the plurality is undetected and a single answer is returned 
<A NAME="295"></A>as if to a single question. Now, in some cases, it is easy to see that 
<A NAME="296"></A>there is more than one, and that an answer is not to be given, e.g. 'Does 
<A NAME="297"></A>the earth consist of sea, or the sky?' But in some cases it is less easy, 
<A NAME="298"></A>and then people treat the question as one, and either confess their defeat 
<A NAME="299"></A>by failing to answer the question, or are exposed to an apparent refutation. 
<A NAME="300"></A>Thus 'Is A and is B a man?' 'Yes.' 'Then if any one hits A and B, he will 
<A NAME="301"></A>strike a man' (singular),'not men' (plural). Or again, where part is good 
<A NAME="302"></A>and part bad, 'is the whole good or bad?' For whichever he says, it is 
<A NAME="303"></A>possible that he might be thought to expose himself to an apparent refutation 
<A NAME="304"></A>or to make an apparently false statement: for to say that something is 
<A NAME="305"></A>good which is not good, or not good which is good, is to make a false statement. 
<A NAME="306"></A>Sometimes, however, additional premisses may actually give rise to a genuine 
<A NAME="307"></A>refutation; e.g. suppose a man were to grant that the descriptions 'white' 
<A NAME="308"></A>and 'naked' and 'blind' apply to one thing and to a number of things in 
<A NAME="309"></A>a like sense. For if 'blind' describes a thing that cannot see though nature 
<A NAME="310"></A>designed it to see, it will also describe things that cannot see though 
<A NAME="311"></A>nature designed them to do so. Whenever, then, one thing can see while 
<A NAME="312"></A>another cannot, they will either both be able to see or else both be blind; 
<A NAME="313"></A>which is impossible.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="314"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>The right way, then, is either to divide apparent proofs and refutations 
<A NAME="316"></A>as above, or else to refer them all to ignorance of what 'refutation' is, 
<A NAME="317"></A>and make that our starting-point: for it is possible to analyse all the 
<A NAME="318"></A>aforesaid modes of fallacy into breaches of the definition of a refutation. 
<A NAME="319"></A>In the first place, we may see if they are inconclusive: for the conclusion 
<A NAME="320"></A>ought to result from the premisses laid down, so as to compel us necessarily 
<A NAME="321"></A>to state it and not merely to seem to compel us. Next we should also take 
<A NAME="322"></A>the definition bit by bit, and try the fallacy thereby. For of the fallacies 
<A NAME="323"></A>that consist in language, some depend upon a double meaning, e.g. ambiguity 
<A NAME="324"></A>of words and of phrases, and the fallacy of like verbal forms (for we habitually 
<A NAME="325"></A>speak of everything as though it were a particular substance)-while fallacies 
<A NAME="326"></A>of combination and division and accent arise because the phrase in question 
<A NAME="327"></A>or the term as altered is not the same as was intended. Even this, however, 
<A NAME="328"></A>should be the same, just as the thing signified should be as well, if a 
<A NAME="329"></A>refutation or proof is to be effected; e.g. if the point concerns a doublet, 
<A NAME="330"></A>then you should draw the conclusion of a 'doublet', not of a 'cloak'. For 
<A NAME="331"></A>the former conclusion also would be true, but it has not been proved; we 
<A NAME="332"></A>need a further question to show that 'doublet' means the same thing, in 
<A NAME="333"></A>order to satisfy any one who asks why you think your point 
<A NAME="334"></A>proved.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>Fallacies that depend on Accident are clear cases of ignoratio 
<A NAME="336"></A>elenchi when once 'proof' has been defined. For the same definition ought 
<A NAME="337"></A>to hold good of 'refutation' too, except that a mention of 'the contradictory' 
<A NAME="338"></A>is here added: for a refutation is a proof of the contradictory. If, then, 
<A NAME="339"></A>there is no proof as regards an accident of anything, there is no refutation. 
<A NAME="340"></A>For supposing, when A and B are, C must necessarily be, and C is white, 
<A NAME="341"></A>there is no necessity for it to be white on account of the syllogism. So, 
<A NAME="342"></A>if the triangle has its angles equal to two right-angles, and it happens 
<A NAME="343"></A>to be a figure, or the simplest element or starting point, it is not because 
<A NAME="344"></A>it is a figure or a starting point or simplest element that it has this 
<A NAME="345"></A>character. For the demonstration proves the point about it not qua figure 
<A NAME="346"></A>or qua simplest element, but qua triangle. Likewise also in other cases. 
<A NAME="347"></A>If, then, refutation is a proof, an argument which argued per accidens 
<A NAME="348"></A>could not be a refutation. It is, however, just in this that the experts 
<A NAME="349"></A>and men of science generally suffer refutation at the hand of the unscientific: 
<A NAME="350"></A>for the latter meet the scientists with reasonings constituted per accidens; 
<A NAME="351"></A>and the scientists for lack of the power to draw distinctions either say 
<A NAME="352"></A>'Yes' to their questions, or else people suppose them to have said 'Yes', 
<A NAME="353"></A>although they have not.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>Those that depend upon whether something is said in a certain respect 
<A NAME="355"></A>only or said absolutely, are clear cases of ignoratio elenchi because the 
<A NAME="356"></A>affirmation and the denial are not concerned with the same point. For of 
<A NAME="357"></A>'white in a certain respect' the negation is 'not white in a certain respect', 
<A NAME="358"></A>while of 'white absolutely' it is 'not white, absolutely'. If, then, a 
<A NAME="359"></A>man treats the admission that a thing is 'white in a certain respect' as 
<A NAME="360"></A>though it were said to be white absolutely, he does not effect a refutation, 
<A NAME="361"></A>but merely appears to do so owing to ignorance of what refutation 
<A NAME="362"></A>is.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>The clearest cases of all, however, are those that were previously 
<A NAME="364"></A>described' as depending upon the definition of a 'refutation': and this 
<A NAME="365"></A>is also why they were called by that name. For the appearance of a refutation 
<A NAME="366"></A>is produced because of the omission in the definition, and if we divide 
<A NAME="367"></A>fallacies in the above manner, we ought to set 'Defective definition' as 
<A NAME="368"></A>a common mark upon them all.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>Those that depend upon the assumption of the original point and 
<A NAME="370"></A>upon stating as the cause what is not the cause, are clearly shown to be 
<A NAME="371"></A>cases of ignoratio elenchi through the definition thereof. For the conclusion 
<A NAME="372"></A>ought to come about 'because these things are so', and this does not happen 
<A NAME="373"></A>where the premisses are not causes of it: and again it should come about 
<A NAME="374"></A>without taking into account the original point, and this is not the case 
<A NAME="375"></A>with those arguments which depend upon begging the original 
<A NAME="376"></A>point.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>Those that depend upon the assumption of the original point and 
<A NAME="378"></A>upon stating as the cause what is not the cause, are clearly shown to be 
<A NAME="379"></A>cases of ignoratio elenchi through the definition thereof. For the conclusion 
<A NAME="380"></A>ought to come about 'because these things are so', and this does not happen 
<A NAME="381"></A>where the premisses are not causes of it: and again it should come about 
<A NAME="382"></A>without taking into account the original point, and this is not the case 
<A NAME="383"></A>with those arguments which depend upon begging the original 
<A NAME="384"></A>point.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>Those that depend upon the consequent are a branch of Accident: 
<A NAME="386"></A>for the consequent is an accident, only it differs from the accident in 
<A NAME="387"></A>this, that you may secure an admission of the accident in the case of one 
<A NAME="388"></A>thing only (e.g. the identity of a yellow thing and honey and of a white 
<A NAME="389"></A>thing and swan), whereas the consequent always involves more than one thing: 
<A NAME="390"></A>for we claim that things that are the same as one and the same thing are 
<A NAME="391"></A>also the same as one another, and this is the ground of a refutation dependent 
<A NAME="392"></A>on the consequent. It is, however, not always true, e.g. suppose that and 
<A NAME="393"></A>B are the same as C per accidens; for both 'snow' and the 'swan' are the 
<A NAME="394"></A>same as something white'. Or again, as in Melissus' argument, a man assumes 
<A NAME="395"></A>that to 'have been generated' and to 'have a beginning' are the same thing, 
<A NAME="396"></A>or to 'become equal' and to 'assume the same magnitude'. For because what 
<A NAME="397"></A>has been generated has a beginning, he claims also that what has a beginning 
<A NAME="398"></A>has been generated, and argues as though both what has been generated and 
<A NAME="399"></A>what is finite were the same because each has a beginning. Likewise also 
<A NAME="400"></A>in the case of things that are made equal he assumes that if things that 
<A NAME="401"></A>assume one and the same magnitude become equal, then also things that become 
<A NAME="402"></A>equal assume one magnitude: i.e. he assumes the consequent. Inasmuch, then, 
<A NAME="403"></A>as a refutation depending on accident consists in ignorance of what a refutation 
<A NAME="404"></A>is, clearly so also does a refutation depending on the consequent. We shall 
<A NAME="405"></A>have further to examine this in another way as well.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR>Those fallacies that depend upon the making of several questions 
<A NAME="407"></A>into one consist in our failure to dissect the definition of 'proposition'. 
<A NAME="408"></A>For a proposition is a single statement about a single thing. For the same 
<A NAME="409"></A>definition applies to 'one single thing only' and to the 'thing', simply, 
<A NAME="410"></A>e.g. to 'man' and to 'one single man only' and likewise also in other cases. 
<A NAME="411"></A>If, then, a 'single proposition' be one which claims a single thing of 
<A NAME="412"></A>a single thing, a 'proposition', simply, will also be the putting of a 
<A NAME="413"></A>question of that kind. Now since a proof starts from propositions and refutation 
<A NAME="414"></A>is a proof, refutation, too, will start from propositions. If, then, a 
<A NAME="415"></A>proposition is a single statement about a single thing, it is obvious that 
<A NAME="416"></A>this fallacy too consists in ignorance of what a refutation is: for in 
<A NAME="417"></A>it what is not a proposition appears to be one. If, then, the answerer 
<A NAME="418"></A>has returned an answer as though to a single question, there will be a 
<A NAME="419"></A>refutation; while if he has returned one not really but apparently, there 
<A NAME="420"></A>will be an apparent refutation of his thesis. All the types of fallacy, 
<A NAME="421"></A>then, fall under ignorance of what a refutation is, some of them because 
<A NAME="422"></A>the contradiction, which is the distinctive mark of a refutation, is merely 
<A NAME="423"></A>apparent, and the rest failing to conform to the definition of a 
<A NAME="424"></A>proof.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="425"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>The deception comes about in the case of arguments that depend 
<A NAME="427"></A>on ambiguity of words and of phrases because we are unable to divide the 
<A NAME="428"></A>ambiguous term (for some terms it is not easy to divide, e.g. 'unity', 
<A NAME="429"></A>'being', and 'sameness'), while in those that depend on combination and 
<A NAME="430"></A>division, it is because we suppose that it makes no difference whether 
<A NAME="431"></A>the phrase be combined or divided, as is indeed the case with most phrases. 
<A NAME="432"></A>Likewise also with those that depend on accent: for the lowering or raising 
<A NAME="433"></A>of the voice upon a phrase is thought not to alter its meaning-with any 
<A NAME="434"></A>phrase, or not with many. With those that depend on the of expression it 
<A NAME="435"></A>is because of the likeness of expression. For it is hard to distinguish 
<A NAME="436"></A>what kind of things are signified by the same and what by different kinds 
<A NAME="437"></A>of expression: for a man who can do this is practically next door to the 
<A NAME="438"></A>understanding of the truth. A special reason why a man is liable to be 
<A NAME="439"></A>hurried into assent to the fallacy is that we suppose every predicate of 
<A NAME="440"></A>everything to be an individual thing, and we understand it as being one 
<A NAME="441"></A>with the thing: and we therefore treat it as a substance: for it is to 
<A NAME="442"></A>that which is one with a thing or substance, as also to substance itself, 
<A NAME="443"></A>that 'individually' and 'being' are deemed to belong in the fullest sense. 
<A NAME="444"></A>For this reason, too, this type of fallacy is to be ranked among those 
<A NAME="445"></A>that depend on language; in the first place, because the deception is effected 
<A NAME="446"></A>the more readily when we are inquiring into a problem in company with others 
<A NAME="447"></A>than when we do so by ourselves (for an inquiry with another person is 
<A NAME="448"></A>carried on by means of speech, whereas an inquiry by oneself is carried 
<A NAME="449"></A>on quite as much by means of the object itself); secondly a man is liable 
<A NAME="450"></A>to be deceived, even when inquiring by himself, when he takes speech as 
<A NAME="451"></A>the basis of his inquiry: moreover the deception arises out of the likeness 
<A NAME="452"></A>(of two different things), and the likeness arises out of the language. 
<A NAME="453"></A>With those fallacies that depend upon Accident, deception comes about because 
<A NAME="454"></A>we cannot distinguish the sameness and otherness of terms, i.e. their unity 
<A NAME="455"></A>and multiplicity, or what kinds of predicate have all the same accidents 
<A NAME="456"></A>as their subject. Likewise also with those that depend on the Consequent: 
<A NAME="457"></A>for the consequent is a branch of Accident. Moreover, in many cases appearances 
<A NAME="458"></A>point to this-and the claim is made that if is inseparable from B, so also 
<A NAME="459"></A>is B from With those that depend upon an imperfection in the definition 
<A NAME="460"></A>of a refutation, and with those that depend upon the difference between 
<A NAME="461"></A>a qualified and an absolute statement, the deception consists in the smallness 
<A NAME="462"></A>of the difference involved; for we treat the limitation to the particular 
<A NAME="463"></A>thing or respect or manner or time as adding nothing to the meaning, and 
<A NAME="464"></A>so grant the statement universally. Likewise also in the case of those 
<A NAME="465"></A>that assume the original point, and those of false cause, and all that 
<A NAME="466"></A>treat a number of questions as one: for in all of them the deception lies 
<A NAME="467"></A>in the smallness of the difference: for our failure to be quite exact in 
<A NAME="468"></A>our definition of 'premiss' and of 'proof' is due to the aforesaid 
<A NAME="469"></A>reason.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="470"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>Since we know on how many points apparent syllogisms depend, we 
<A NAME="472"></A>know also on how many sophistical syllogisms and refutations may depend. 
<A NAME="473"></A>By a sophistical refutation and syllogism I mean not only a syllogism or 
<A NAME="474"></A>refutation which appears to be valid but is not, but also one which, though 
<A NAME="475"></A>it is valid, only appears to be appropriate to the thing in question. These 
<A NAME="476"></A>are those which fail to refute and prove people to be ignorant according 
<A NAME="477"></A>to the nature of the thing in question, which was the function of the art 
<A NAME="478"></A>of examination. Now the art of examining is a branch of dialectic: and 
<A NAME="479"></A>this may prove a false conclusion because of the ignorance of the answerer. 
<A NAME="480"></A>Sophistic refutations on the other hand, even though they prove the contradictory 
<A NAME="481"></A>of his thesis, do not make clear whether he is ignorant: for sophists entangle 
<A NAME="482"></A>the scientist as well with these arguments.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>That we know them by the same line of inquiry is clear: for the 
<A NAME="484"></A>same considerations which make it appear to an audience that the points 
<A NAME="485"></A>required for the proof were asked in the questions and that the conclusion 
<A NAME="486"></A>was proved, would make the answerer think so as well, so that false proof 
<A NAME="487"></A>will occur through all or some of these means: for what a man has not been 
<A NAME="488"></A>asked but thinks he has granted, he would also grant if he were asked. 
<A NAME="489"></A>Of course, in some cases the moment we add the missing question, we also 
<A NAME="490"></A>show up its falsity, e.g. in fallacies that depend on language and on solecism. 
<A NAME="491"></A>If then, fallacious proofs of the contradictory of a thesis depend on their 
<A NAME="492"></A>appearing to refute, it is clear that the considerations on which both 
<A NAME="493"></A>proofs of false conclusions and an apparent refutation depend must be the 
<A NAME="494"></A>same in number. Now an apparent refutation depends upon the elements involved 
<A NAME="495"></A>in a genuine one: for the failure of one or other of these must make the 
<A NAME="496"></A>refutation merely apparent, e.g. that which depends on the failure of the 
<A NAME="497"></A>conclusion to follow from the argument (the argument ad impossible) and 
<A NAME="498"></A>that which treats two questions as one and so depends upon a flaw in the 
<A NAME="499"></A>premiss, and that which depends on the substitution of an accident for 
<A NAME="500"></A>an essential attribute, and-a branch of the last-that which depends upon 
<A NAME="501"></A>the consequent: more over, the conclusion may follow not in fact but only 
<A NAME="502"></A>verbally: then, instead of proving the contradictory universally and in 
<A NAME="503"></A>the same respect and relation and manner, the fallacy may be dependent 
<A NAME="504"></A>on some limit of extent or on one or other of these qualifications: moreover, 
<A NAME="505"></A>there is the assumption of the original point to be proved, in violation 
<A NAME="506"></A>of the clause 'without reckoning in the original point'. Thus we should 
<A NAME="507"></A>have the number of considerations on which the fallacious proofs depend: 
<A NAME="508"></A>for they could not depend on more, but all will depend on the points 
<A NAME="509"></A>aforesaid.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>A sophistical refutation is a refutation not absolutely but relatively 
<A NAME="511"></A>to some one: and so is a proof, in the same way. For unless that which 
<A NAME="512"></A>depends upon ambiguity assumes that the ambiguous term has a single meaning, 
<A NAME="513"></A>and that which depends on like verbal forms assumes that substance is the 
<A NAME="514"></A>only category, and the rest in the same way, there will be neither refutations 
<A NAME="515"></A>nor proofs, either absolutely or relatively to the answerer: whereas if 
<A NAME="516"></A>they do assume these things, they will stand, relatively to the answerer; 
<A NAME="517"></A>but absolutely they will not stand: for they have not secured a statement 
<A NAME="518"></A>that does have a single meaning, but only one that appears to have, and 
<A NAME="519"></A>that only from this particular man.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="520"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>The number of considerations on which depend the refutations of 
<A NAME="522"></A>those who are refuted, we ought not to try to grasp without a knowledge 
<A NAME="523"></A>of everything that is. This, however, is not the province of any special 
<A NAME="524"></A>study: for possibly the sciences are infinite in number, so that obviously 
<A NAME="525"></A>demonstrations may be infinite too. Now refutations may be true as well 
<A NAME="526"></A>as false: for whenever it is possible to demonstrate something, it is also 
<A NAME="527"></A>possible to refute the man who maintains the contradictory of the truth; 
<A NAME="528"></A>e.g. if a man has stated that the diagonal is commensurate with the side 
<A NAME="529"></A>of the square, one might refute him by demonstrating that it is incommensurate. 
<A NAME="530"></A>Accordingly, to exhaust all possible refutations we shall have to have 
<A NAME="531"></A>scientific knowledge of everything: for some refutations depend upon the 
<A NAME="532"></A>principles that rule in geometry and the conclusions that follow from these, 
<A NAME="533"></A>others upon those that rule in medicine, and others upon those of the other 
<A NAME="534"></A>sciences. For the matter of that, the false refutations likewise belong 
<A NAME="535"></A>to the number of the infinite: for according to every art there is false 
<A NAME="536"></A>proof, e.g. according to geometry there is false geometrical proof, and 
<A NAME="537"></A>according to medicine there is false medical proof. By 'according to the 
<A NAME="538"></A>art', I mean 'according to the principles of it'. Clearly, then, it is 
<A NAME="539"></A>not of all refutations, but only of those that depend upon dialectic that 
<A NAME="540"></A>we need to grasp the common-place rules: for these stand in a common relation 
<A NAME="541"></A>to every art and faculty. And as regards the refutation that is according 
<A NAME="542"></A>to one or other of the particular sciences it is the task of that particular 
<A NAME="543"></A>scientist to examine whether it is merely apparent without being real, 
<A NAME="544"></A>and, if it be real, what is the reason for it: whereas it is the business 
<A NAME="545"></A>of dialecticians so to examine the refutation that proceeds from the common 
<A NAME="546"></A>first principles that fall under no particular special study. For if we 
<A NAME="547"></A>grasp the startingpoints of the accepted proofs on any subject whatever 
<A NAME="548"></A>we grasp those of the refutations current on that subject. For a refutation 
<A NAME="549"></A>is the proof of the contradictory of a given thesis, so that either one 
<A NAME="550"></A>or two proofs of the contradictory constitute a refutation. We grasp, then, 
<A NAME="551"></A>the number of considerations on which all such depend: if, however, we 
<A NAME="552"></A>grasp this, we also grasp their solutions as well; for the objections to 
<A NAME="553"></A>these are the solutions of them. We also grasp the number of considerations 
<A NAME="554"></A>on which those refutations depend, that are merely apparent-apparent, I 
<A NAME="555"></A>mean, not to everybody, but to people of a certain stamp; for it is an 
<A NAME="556"></A>indefinite task if one is to inquire how many are the considerations that 
<A NAME="557"></A>make them apparent to the man in the street. Accordingly it is clear that 
<A NAME="558"></A>the dialectician's business is to be able to grasp on how many considerations 
<A NAME="559"></A>depends the formation, through the common first principles, of a refutation 
<A NAME="560"></A>that is either real or apparent, i.e. either dialectical or apparently 
<A NAME="561"></A>dialectical, or suitable for an examination.

<A NAME="562"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>It is no true distinction between arguments which some people draw 
<A NAME="564"></A>when they say that some arguments are directed against the expression, 
<A NAME="565"></A>and others against the thought expressed: for it is absurd to suppose that 
<A NAME="566"></A>some arguments are directed against the expression and others against the 
<A NAME="567"></A>thought, and that they are not the same. For what is failure to direct 
<A NAME="568"></A>an argument against the thought except what occurs whenever a man does 
<A NAME="569"></A>not in using the expression think it to be used in his question in the 
<A NAME="570"></A>same sense in which the person questioned granted it? And this is the same 
<A NAME="571"></A>thing as to direct the argument against the expression. On the other hand, 
<A NAME="572"></A>it is directed against the thought whenever a man uses the expression in 
<A NAME="573"></A>the same sense which the answerer had in mind when he granted it. If now 
<A NAME="574"></A>any (i.e. both the questioner and the person questioned), in dealing with 
<A NAME="575"></A>an expression with more than one meaning, were to suppose it to have one 
<A NAME="576"></A>meaning-as e.g. it may be that 'Being' and 'One' have many meanings, and 
<A NAME="577"></A>yet both the answerer answers and the questioner puts his question supposing 
<A NAME="578"></A>it to be one, and the argument is to the effect that 'All things are one'-will 
<A NAME="579"></A>this discussion be directed any more against the expression than against 
<A NAME="580"></A>the thought of the person questioned? If, on the other hand, one of them 
<A NAME="581"></A>supposes the expression to have many meanings, it is clear that such a 
<A NAME="582"></A>discussion will not be directed against the thought. Such being the meanings 
<A NAME="583"></A>of the phrases in question, they clearly cannot describe two separate classes 
<A NAME="584"></A>of argument. For, in the first place, it is possible for any such argument 
<A NAME="585"></A>as bears more than one meaning to be directed against the expression and 
<A NAME="586"></A>against the thought, and next it is possible for any argument whatsoever; 
<A NAME="587"></A>for the fact of being directed against the thought consists not in the 
<A NAME="588"></A>nature of the argument, but in the special attitude of the answerer towards 
<A NAME="589"></A>the points he concedes. Next, all of them may be directed to the expression. 
<A NAME="590"></A>For 'to be directed against the expression' means in this doctrine 'not 
<A NAME="591"></A>to be directed against the thought'. For if not all are directed against 
<A NAME="592"></A>either expression or thought, there will be certain other arguments directed 
<A NAME="593"></A>neither against the expression nor against the thought, whereas they say 
<A NAME="594"></A>that all must be one or the other, and divide them all as directed either 
<A NAME="595"></A>against the expression or against the thought, while others (they say) 
<A NAME="596"></A>there are none. But in point of fact those that depend on mere expression 
<A NAME="597"></A>are only a branch of those syllogisms that depend on a multiplicity of 
<A NAME="598"></A>meanings. For the absurd statement has actually been made that the description 
<A NAME="599"></A>'dependent on mere expression' describes all the arguments that depend 
<A NAME="600"></A>on language: whereas some of these are fallacies not because the answerer 
<A NAME="601"></A>adopts a particular attitude towards them, but because the argument itself 
<A NAME="602"></A>involves the asking of a question such as bears more than one 
<A NAME="603"></A>meaning.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR>It is, too, altogether absurd to discuss Refutation without first 
<A NAME="605"></A>discussing Proof: for a refutation is a proof, so that one ought to discuss 
<A NAME="606"></A>proof as well before describing false refutation: for a refutation of that 
<A NAME="607"></A>kind is a merely apparent proof of the contradictory of a thesis. Accordingly, 
<A NAME="608"></A>the reason of the falsity will be either in the proof or in the contradiction 
<A NAME="609"></A>(for mention of the 'contradiction' must be added), while sometimes it 
<A NAME="610"></A>is in both, if the refutation be merely apparent. In the argument that 
<A NAME="611"></A>speaking of the silent is possible it lies in the contradiction, not in 
<A NAME="612"></A>the proof; in the argument that one can give what one does not possess, 
<A NAME="613"></A>it lies in both; in the proof that Homer's poem is a figure through its 
<A NAME="614"></A>being a cycle it lies in the proof. An argument that does not fail in either 
<A NAME="615"></A>respect is a true proof.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>But, to return to the point whence our argument digressed, are 
<A NAME="617"></A>mathematical reasonings directed against the thought, or not? And if any 
<A NAME="618"></A>one thinks 'triangle' to be a word with many meanings, and granted it in 
<A NAME="619"></A>some different sense from the figure which was proved to contain two right 
<A NAME="620"></A>angles, has the questioner here directed his argument against the thought 
<A NAME="621"></A>of the former or not?
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, if the expression bears many senses, while the answerer 
<A NAME="623"></A>does not understand or suppose it to have them, surely the questioner here 
<A NAME="624"></A>has directed his argument against his thought! Or how else ought he to 
<A NAME="625"></A>put his question except by suggesting a distinction-suppose one's question 
<A NAME="626"></A>to be speaking of the silent possible or not?'-as follows, 'Is the answer 
<A NAME="627"></A>"No" in one sense, but "Yes" in another?' If, then, any one were to answer 
<A NAME="628"></A>that it was not possible in any sense and the other were to argue that 
<A NAME="629"></A>it was, has not his argument been directed against the thought of the answerer? 
<A NAME="630"></A>Yet his argument is supposed to be one of those that depend on the expression. 
<A NAME="631"></A>There is not, then, any definite kind of arguments that is directed against 
<A NAME="632"></A>the thought. Some arguments are, indeed, directed against the expression: 
<A NAME="633"></A>but these are not all even apparent refutations, let alone all refutations. 
<A NAME="634"></A>For there are also apparent refutations which do not depend upon language, 
<A NAME="635"></A>e.g. those that depend upon accident, and others.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>If, however, any one claims that one should actually draw the distinction, 
<A NAME="637"></A>and say, 'By "speaking of the silent" I mean, in one sense this and in 
<A NAME="638"></A>the other sense that', surely to claim this is in the first place absurd 
<A NAME="639"></A>(for sometimes the questioner does not see the ambiguity of his question, 
<A NAME="640"></A>and he cannot possibly draw a distinction which he does not think to be 
<A NAME="641"></A>there): in the second place, what else but this will didactic argument 
<A NAME="642"></A>be? For it will make manifest the state of the case to one who has never 
<A NAME="643"></A>considered, and does not know or suppose that there is any other meaning 
<A NAME="644"></A>but one. For what is there to prevent the same thing also happening to 
<A NAME="645"></A>us in cases where there is no double meaning? 'Are the units in four equal 
<A NAME="646"></A>to the twos? Observe that the twos are contained in four in one sense in 
<A NAME="647"></A>this way, in another sense in that'. Also, 'Is the knowledge of contraries 
<A NAME="648"></A>one or not? Observe that some contraries are known, while others are unknown'. 
<A NAME="649"></A>Thus the man who makes this claim seems to be unaware of the difference 
<A NAME="650"></A>between didactic and dialectical argument, and of the fact that while he 
<A NAME="651"></A>who argues didactically should not ask questions but make things clear 
<A NAME="652"></A>himself, the other should merely ask questions.
