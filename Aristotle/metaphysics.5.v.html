<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>"'BEGINNING' means (1) that part of a thing from which one would 
<A NAME="13"></A>start first, e.g a line or a road has a beginning in either of the contrary 
<A NAME="14"></A>directions. (2) That from which each thing would best be originated, e.g. 
<A NAME="15"></A>even in learning we must sometimes begin not from the first point and the 
<A NAME="16"></A>beginning of the subject, but from the point from which we should learn 
<A NAME="17"></A>most easily. (4) That from which, as an immanent part, a thing first comes 
<A NAME="18"></A>to be, e,g, as the keel of a ship and the foundation of a house, while 
<A NAME="19"></A>in animals some suppose the heart, others the brain, others some other 
<A NAME="20"></A>part, to be of this nature. (4) That from which, not as an immanent part, 
<A NAME="21"></A>a thing first comes to be, and from which the movement or the change naturally 
<A NAME="22"></A>first begins, as a child comes from its father and its mother, and a fight 
<A NAME="23"></A>from abusive language. (5) That at whose will that which is moved is moved 
<A NAME="24"></A>and that which changes changes, e.g. the magistracies in cities, and oligarchies 
<A NAME="25"></A>and monarchies and tyrannies, are called arhchai, and so are the arts, 
<A NAME="26"></A>and of these especially the architectonic arts. (6) That from which a thing 
<A NAME="27"></A>can first be known,-this also is called the beginning of the thing, e.g. 
<A NAME="28"></A>the hypotheses are the beginnings of demonstrations. (Causes are spoken 
<A NAME="29"></A>of in an equal number of senses; for all causes are beginnings.) It is 
<A NAME="30"></A>common, then, to all beginnings to be the first point from which a thing 
<A NAME="31"></A>either is or comes to be or is known; but of these some are immanent in 
<A NAME="32"></A>the thing and others are outside. Hence the nature of a thing is a beginning, 
<A NAME="33"></A>and so is the element of a thing, and thought and will, and essence, and 
<A NAME="34"></A>the final cause-for the good and the beautiful are the beginning both of 
<A NAME="35"></A>the knowledge and of the movement of many things.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="36"></A><B>Part 2</B>
<A NAME="37"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>"'Cause' means (1) that from which, as immanent material, a thing 
<A NAME="39"></A>comes into being, e.g. the bronze is the cause of the statue and the silver 
<A NAME="40"></A>of the saucer, and so are the classes which include these. (2) The form 
<A NAME="41"></A>or pattern, i.e. the definition of the essence, and the classes which include 
<A NAME="42"></A>this (e.g. the ratio 2:1 and number in general are causes of the octave), 
<A NAME="43"></A>and the parts included in the definition. (3) That from which the change 
<A NAME="44"></A>or the resting from change first begins; e.g. the adviser is a cause of 
<A NAME="45"></A>the action, and the father a cause of the child, and in general the maker 
<A NAME="46"></A>a cause of the thing made and the change-producing of the changing. (4) 
<A NAME="47"></A>The end, i.e. that for the sake of which a thing is; e.g. health is the 
<A NAME="48"></A>cause of walking. For 'Why does one walk?' we say; 'that one may be healthy'; 
<A NAME="49"></A>and in speaking thus we think we have given the cause. The same is true 
<A NAME="50"></A>of all the means that intervene before the end, when something else has 
<A NAME="51"></A>put the process in motion, as e.g. thinning or purging or drugs or instruments 
<A NAME="52"></A>intervene before health is reached; for all these are for the sake of the 
<A NAME="53"></A>end, though they differ from one another in that some are instruments and 
<A NAME="54"></A>others are actions. <BR><BR>"These, then, are practically all the senses 
<A NAME="55"></A>in which causes are spoken of, and as they are spoken of in several senses 
<A NAME="56"></A>it follows both that there are several causes of the same thing, and in 
<A NAME="57"></A>no accidental sense (e.g. both the art of sculpture and the bronze are 
<A NAME="58"></A>causes of the statue not in respect of anything else but qua statue; not, 
<A NAME="59"></A>however, in the same way, but the one as matter and the other as source 
<A NAME="60"></A>of the movement), and that things can be causes of one another (e.g. exercise 
<A NAME="61"></A>of good condition, and the latter of exercise; not, however, in the same 
<A NAME="62"></A>way, but the one as end and the other as source of movement).-Again, the 
<A NAME="63"></A>same thing is the cause of contraries; for that which when present causes 
<A NAME="64"></A>a particular thing, we sometimes charge, when absent, with the contrary, 
<A NAME="65"></A>e.g. we impute the shipwreck to the absence of the steersman, whose presence 
<A NAME="66"></A>was the cause of safety; and both-the presence and the privation-are causes 
<A NAME="67"></A>as sources of movement. <BR><BR>"All the causes now mentioned fall under 
<A NAME="68"></A>four senses which are the most obvious. For the letters are the cause of 
<A NAME="69"></A>syllables, and the material is the cause of manufactured things, and fire 
<A NAME="70"></A>and earth and all such things are the causes of bodies, and the parts are 
<A NAME="71"></A>causes of the whole, and the hypotheses are causes of the conclusion, in 
<A NAME="72"></A>the sense that they are that out of which these respectively are made; 
<A NAME="73"></A>but of these some are cause as the substratum (e.g. the parts), others 
<A NAME="74"></A>as the essence (the whole, the synthesis, and the form). The semen, the 
<A NAME="75"></A>physician, the adviser, and in general the agent, are all sources of change 
<A NAME="76"></A>or of rest. The remainder are causes as the end and the good of the other 
<A NAME="77"></A>things; for that for the sake of which other things are tends to be the 
<A NAME="78"></A>best and the end of the other things; let us take it as making no difference 
<A NAME="79"></A>whether we call it good or apparent good. <BR><BR>"These, then, are the 
<A NAME="80"></A>causes, and this is the number of their kinds, but the varieties of causes 
<A NAME="81"></A>are many in number, though when summarized these also are comparatively 
<A NAME="82"></A>few. Causes are spoken of in many senses, and even of those which are of 
<A NAME="83"></A>the same kind some are causes in a prior and others in a posterior sense, 
<A NAME="84"></A>e.g. both 'the physician' and 'the professional man' are causes of health, 
<A NAME="85"></A>and both 'the ratio 2:1' and 'number' are causes of the octave, and the 
<A NAME="86"></A>classes that include any particular cause are always causes of the particular 
<A NAME="87"></A>effect. Again, there are accidental causes and the classes which include 
<A NAME="88"></A>these; e.g. while in one sense 'the sculptor' causes the statue, in another 
<A NAME="89"></A>sense 'Polyclitus' causes it, because the sculptor happens to be Polyclitus; 
<A NAME="90"></A>and the classes that include the accidental cause are also causes, e.g. 
<A NAME="91"></A>'man'-or in general 'animal'-is the cause of the statue, because Polyclitus 
<A NAME="92"></A>is a man, and man is an animal. Of accidental causes also some are more 
<A NAME="93"></A>remote or nearer than others, as, for instance, if 'the white' and 'the 
<A NAME="94"></A>musical' were called causes of the statue, and not only 'Polyclitus' or 
<A NAME="95"></A>'man'. But besides all these varieties of causes, whether proper or accidental, 
<A NAME="96"></A>some are called causes as being able to act, others as acting; e.g. the 
<A NAME="97"></A>cause of the house's being built is a builder, or a builder who is building.-The 
<A NAME="98"></A>same variety of language will be found with regard to the effects of causes; 
<A NAME="99"></A>e.g. a thing may be called the cause of this statue or of a statue or in 
<A NAME="100"></A>general of an image, and of this bronze or of bronze or of matter in general; 
<A NAME="101"></A>and similarly in the case of accidental effects. Again, both accidental 
<A NAME="102"></A>and proper causes may be spoken of in combination; e.g. we may say not 
<A NAME="103"></A>'Polyclitus' nor 'the sculptor' but 'Polyclitus the sculptor'. Yet all 
<A NAME="104"></A>these are but six in number, while each is spoken of in two ways; for (A) 
<A NAME="105"></A>they are causes either as the individual, or as the genus, or as the accidental, 
<A NAME="106"></A>or as the genus that includes the accidental, and these either as combined, 
<A NAME="107"></A>or as taken simply; and (B) all may be taken as acting or as having a capacity. 
<A NAME="108"></A>But they differ inasmuch as the acting causes, i.e. the individuals, exist, 
<A NAME="109"></A>or do not exist, simultaneously with the things of which they are causes, 
<A NAME="110"></A>e.g. this particular man who is healing, with this particular man who is 
<A NAME="111"></A>recovering health, and this particular builder with this particular thing 
<A NAME="112"></A>that is being built; but the potential causes are not always in this case; 
<A NAME="113"></A>for the house does not perish at the same time as the 
<A NAME="114"></A>builder.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="115"></A><B>Part 3</B>
<A NAME="116"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>"'Element' means (1) the primary component immanent in a thing, 
<A NAME="118"></A>and indivisible in kind into other kinds; e.g. the elements of speech are 
<A NAME="119"></A>the parts of which speech consists and into which it is ultimately divided, 
<A NAME="120"></A>while they are no longer divided into other forms of speech different in 
<A NAME="121"></A>kind from them. If they are divided, their parts are of the same kind, 
<A NAME="122"></A>as a part of water is water (while a part of the syllable is not a syllable). 
<A NAME="123"></A>Similarly those who speak of the elements of bodies mean the things into 
<A NAME="124"></A>which bodies are ultimately divided, while they are no longer divided into 
<A NAME="125"></A>other things differing in kind; and whether the things of this sort are 
<A NAME="126"></A>one or more, they call these elements. The so-called elements of geometrical 
<A NAME="127"></A>proofs, and in general the elements of demonstrations, have a similar character; 
<A NAME="128"></A>for the primary demonstrations, each of which is implied in many demonstrations, 
<A NAME="129"></A>are called elements of demonstrations; and the primary syllogisms, which 
<A NAME="130"></A>have three terms and proceed by means of one middle, are of this nature. 
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>"(2) People also transfer the word 'element' from this meaning 
<A NAME="132"></A>and apply it to that which, being one and small, is useful for many purposes; 
<A NAME="133"></A>for which reason what is small and simple and indivisible is called an 
<A NAME="134"></A>element. Hence come the facts that the most universal things are elements 
<A NAME="135"></A>(because each of them being one and simple is present in a plurality of 
<A NAME="136"></A>things, either in all or in as many as possible), and that unity and the 
<A NAME="137"></A>point are thought by some to be first principles. Now, since the so-called 
<A NAME="138"></A>genera are universal and indivisible (for there is no definition of them), 
<A NAME="139"></A>some say the genera are elements, and more so than the differentia, because 
<A NAME="140"></A>the genus is more universal; for where the differentia is present, the 
<A NAME="141"></A>genus accompanies it, but where the genus is present, the differentia is 
<A NAME="142"></A>not always so. It is common to all the meanings that the element of each 
<A NAME="143"></A>thing is the first component immanent in each.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="144"></A><B>Part 4</B>
<A NAME="145"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>"'Nature' means (1) the genesis of growing things-the meaning which 
<A NAME="147"></A>would be suggested if one were to pronounce the 'u' in phusis long. (2) 
<A NAME="148"></A>That immanent part of a growing thing, from which its growth first proceeds. 
<A NAME="149"></A>(3) The source from which the primary movement in each natural object is 
<A NAME="150"></A>present in it in virtue of its own essence. Those things are said to grow 
<A NAME="151"></A>which derive increase from something else by contact and either by organic 
<A NAME="152"></A>unity, or by organic adhesion as in the case of embryos. Organic unity 
<A NAME="153"></A>differs from contact; for in the latter case there need not be anything 
<A NAME="154"></A>besides the contact, but in organic unities there is something identical 
<A NAME="155"></A>in both parts, which makes them grow together instead of merely touching, 
<A NAME="156"></A>and be one in respect of continuity and quantity, though not of quality.-(4) 
<A NAME="157"></A>'Nature' means the primary material of which any natural object consists 
<A NAME="158"></A>or out of which it is made, which is relatively unshaped and cannot be 
<A NAME="159"></A>changed from its own potency, as e.g. bronze is said to be the nature of 
<A NAME="160"></A>a statue and of bronze utensils, and wood the nature of wooden things; 
<A NAME="161"></A>and so in all other cases; for when a product is made out of these materials, 
<A NAME="162"></A>the first matter is preserved throughout. For it is in this way that people 
<A NAME="163"></A>call the elements of natural objects also their nature, some naming fire, 
<A NAME="164"></A>others earth, others air, others water, others something else of the sort, 
<A NAME="165"></A>and some naming more than one of these, and others all of them.-(5) 'Nature' 
<A NAME="166"></A>means the essence of natural objects, as with those who say the nature 
<A NAME="167"></A>is the primary mode of composition, or as Empedocles says:- 
<A NAME="168"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>"Nothing that is has a nature, <BR><BR>"But only mixing and parting 
<A NAME="170"></A>of the mixed, <BR><BR>"And nature is but a name given them by men. 
<A NAME="171"></A>"<BR><BR>

<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Hence as regards the things that are or come to be by nature, though 
<A NAME="173"></A>that from which they naturally come to be or are is already present, we 
<A NAME="174"></A>say they have not their nature yet, unless they have their form or shape. 
<A NAME="175"></A>That which comprises both of these exists by nature, e.g. the animals and 
<A NAME="176"></A>their parts; and not only is the first matter nature (and this in two senses, 
<A NAME="177"></A>either the first, counting from the thing, or the first in general; e.g. 
<A NAME="178"></A>in the case of works in bronze, bronze is first with reference to them, 
<A NAME="179"></A>but in general perhaps water is first, if all things that can be melted 
<A NAME="180"></A>are water), but also the form or essence, which is the end of the process 
<A NAME="181"></A>of becoming.-(6) By an extension of meaning from this sense of 'nature' 
<A NAME="182"></A>every essence in general has come to be called a 'nature', because the 
<A NAME="183"></A>nature of a thing is one kind of essence. <BR><BR>"From what has been said, 
<A NAME="184"></A>then, it is plain that nature in the primary and strict sense is the essence 
<A NAME="185"></A>of things which have in themselves, as such, a source of movement; for 
<A NAME="186"></A>the matter is called the nature because it is qualified to receive this, 
<A NAME="187"></A>and processes of becoming and growing are called nature because they are 
<A NAME="188"></A>movements proceeding from this. And nature in this sense is the source 
<A NAME="189"></A>of the movement of natural objects, being present in them somehow, either 
<A NAME="190"></A>potentially or in complete reality.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="191"></A><B>Part 5</B>
<A NAME="192"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>"We call 'necessary' (1) (a) that without which, as a condition, 
<A NAME="194"></A>a thing cannot live; e.g. breathing and food are necessary for an animal; 
<A NAME="195"></A>for it is incapable of existing without these; (b) the conditions without 
<A NAME="196"></A>which good cannot be or come to be, or without which we cannot get rid 
<A NAME="197"></A>or be freed of evil; e.g. drinking the medicine is necessary in order that 
<A NAME="198"></A>we may be cured of disease, and a man's sailing to Aegina is necessary 
<A NAME="199"></A>in order that he may get his money.-(2) The compulsory and compulsion, 
<A NAME="200"></A>i.e. that which impedes and tends to hinder, contrary to impulse and purpose. 
<A NAME="201"></A>For the compulsory is called necessary (whence the necessary is painful, 
<A NAME="202"></A>as Evenus says: 'For every necessary thing is ever irksome'), and compulsion 
<A NAME="203"></A>is a form of necessity, as Sophocles says: 'But force necessitates me to 
<A NAME="204"></A>this act'. And necessity is held to be something that cannot be persuaded-and 
<A NAME="205"></A>rightly, for it is contrary to the movement which accords with purpose 
<A NAME="206"></A>and with reasoning.-(3) We say that that which cannot be otherwise is necessarily 
<A NAME="207"></A>as it is. And from this sense of 'necessary' all the others are somehow 
<A NAME="208"></A>derived; for a thing is said to do or suffer what is necessary in the sense 
<A NAME="209"></A>of compulsory, only when it cannot act according to its impulse because 
<A NAME="210"></A>of the compelling forces-which implies that necessity is that because of 
<A NAME="211"></A>which a thing cannot be otherwise; and similarly as regards the conditions 
<A NAME="212"></A>of life and of good; for when in the one case good, in the other life and 
<A NAME="213"></A>being, are not possible without certain conditions, these are necessary, 
<A NAME="214"></A>and this kind of cause is a sort of necessity. Again, demonstration is 
<A NAME="215"></A>a necessary thing because the conclusion cannot be otherwise, if there 
<A NAME="216"></A>has been demonstration in the unqualified sense; and the causes of this 
<A NAME="217"></A>necessity are the first premisses, i.e. the fact that the propositions 
<A NAME="218"></A>from which the syllogism proceeds cannot be otherwise. <BR><BR>"Now some 
<A NAME="219"></A>things owe their necessity to something other than themselves; others do 
<A NAME="220"></A>not, but are themselves the source of necessity in other things. Therefore 
<A NAME="221"></A>the necessary in the primary and strict sense is the simple; for this does 
<A NAME="222"></A>not admit of more states than one, so that it cannot even be in one state 
<A NAME="223"></A>and also in another; for if it did it would already be in more than one. 
<A NAME="224"></A>If, then, there are any things that are eternal and unmovable, nothing 
<A NAME="225"></A>compulsory or against their nature attaches to them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="226"></A><B>Part 6</B>
<A NAME="227"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>"'One' means (1) that which is one by accident, (2) that which 
<A NAME="229"></A>is one by its own nature. (1) Instances of the accidentally one are 'Coriscus 
<A NAME="230"></A>and what is musical', and 'musical Coriscus' (for it is the same thing 
<A NAME="231"></A>to say 'Coriscus and what is musical', and 'musical Coriscus'), and 'what 
<A NAME="232"></A>is musical and what is just', and 'musical Coriscus and just Coriscus'. 
<A NAME="233"></A>For all of these are called one by virtue of an accident, 'what is just 
<A NAME="234"></A>and what is musical' because they are accidents of one substance, 'what 
<A NAME="235"></A>is musical and Coriscus' because the one is an accident of the other; and 
<A NAME="236"></A>similarly in a sense 'musical Coriscus' is one with 'Coriscus' because 
<A NAME="237"></A>one of the parts of the phrase is an accident of the other, i.e. 'musical' 
<A NAME="238"></A>is an accident of Coriscus; and 'musical Coriscus' is one with 'just Coriscus' 
<A NAME="239"></A>because one part of each is an accident of one and the same subject. The 
<A NAME="240"></A>case is similar if the accident is predicated of a genus or of any universal 
<A NAME="241"></A>name, e.g. if one says that man is the same as 'musical man'; for this 
<A NAME="242"></A>is either because 'musical' is an accident of man, which is one substance, 
<A NAME="243"></A>or because both are accidents of some individual, e.g. Coriscus. Both, 
<A NAME="244"></A>however, do not belong to him in the same way, but one presumably as genus 
<A NAME="245"></A>and included in his substance, the other as a state or affection of the 
<A NAME="246"></A>substance. <BR><BR>"The things, then, that are called one in virtue of 
<A NAME="247"></A>an accident, are called so in this way. (2) Of things that are called one 
<A NAME="248"></A>in virtue of their own nature some (a) are so called because they are continuous, 
<A NAME="249"></A>e.g. a bundle is made one by a band, and pieces of wood are made one by 
<A NAME="250"></A>glue; and a line, even if it is bent, is called one if it is continuous, 
<A NAME="251"></A>as each part of the body is, e.g. the leg or the arm. Of these themselves, 
<A NAME="252"></A>the continuous by nature are more one than the continuous by art. A thing 
<A NAME="253"></A>is called continuous which has by its own nature one movement and cannot 
<A NAME="254"></A>have any other; and the movement is one when it is indivisible, and it 
<A NAME="255"></A>is indivisible in respect of time. Those things are continuous by their 
<A NAME="256"></A>own nature which are one not merely by contact; for if you put pieces of 
<A NAME="257"></A>wood touching one another, you will not say these are one piece of wood 
<A NAME="258"></A>or one body or one continuum of any other sort. Things, then, that are 
<A NAME="259"></A>continuous in any way called one, even if they admit of being bent, and 
<A NAME="260"></A>still more those which cannot be bent; e.g. the shin or the thigh is more 
<A NAME="261"></A>one than the leg, because the movement of the leg need not be one. And 
<A NAME="262"></A>the straight line is more one than the bent; but that which is bent and 
<A NAME="263"></A>has an angle we call both one and not one, because its movement may be 
<A NAME="264"></A>either simultaneous or not simultaneous; but that of the straight line 
<A NAME="265"></A>is always simultaneous, and no part of it which has magnitude rests while 
<A NAME="266"></A>another moves, as in the bent line. <BR><BR>"(b)(i) Things are called one 
<A NAME="267"></A>in another sense because their substratum does not differ in kind; it does 
<A NAME="268"></A>not differ in the case of things whose kind is indivisible to sense. The 
<A NAME="269"></A>substratum meant is either the nearest to, or the farthest from, the final 
<A NAME="270"></A>state. For, one the one hand, wine is said to be one and water is said 
<A NAME="271"></A>to be one, qua indivisible in kind; and, on the other hand, all juices, 
<A NAME="272"></A>e.g. oil and wine, are said to be one, and so are all things that can be 
<A NAME="273"></A>melted, because the ultimate substratum of all is the same; for all of 
<A NAME="274"></A>these are water or air. <BR><BR>"(ii) Those things also are called one 
<A NAME="275"></A>whose genus is one though distinguished by opposite differentiae-these 
<A NAME="276"></A>too are all called one because the genus which underlies the differentiae 
<A NAME="277"></A>is one (e.g. horse, man, and dog form a unity, because all are animals), 
<A NAME="278"></A>and indeed in a way similar to that in which the matter is one. These are 
<A NAME="279"></A>sometimes called one in this way, but sometimes it is the higher genus 
<A NAME="280"></A>that is said to be the same (if they are infimae species of their genus)-the 
<A NAME="281"></A>genus above the proximate genera; e.g. the isosceles and the equilateral 
<A NAME="282"></A>are one and the same figure because both are triangles; but they are not 
<A NAME="283"></A>the same triangles. <BR><BR>"(c) Two things are called one, when the definition 
<A NAME="284"></A>which states the essence of one is indivisible from another definition 
<A NAME="285"></A>which shows us the other (though in itself every definition is divisible). 
<A NAME="286"></A>Thus even that which has increased or is diminishing is one, because its 
<A NAME="287"></A>definition is one, as, in the case of plane figures, is the definition 
<A NAME="288"></A>of their form. In general those things the thought of whose essence is 
<A NAME="289"></A>indivisible, and cannot separate them either in time or in place or in 
<A NAME="290"></A>definition, are most of all one, and of these especially those which are 
<A NAME="291"></A>substances. For in general those things that do not admit of division are 
<A NAME="292"></A>called one in so far as they do not admit of it; e.g. if two things are 
<A NAME="293"></A>indistinguishable qua man, they are one kind of man; if qua animal, one 
<A NAME="294"></A>kind of animal; if qua magnitude, one kind of magnitude.-Now most things 
<A NAME="295"></A>are called one because they either do or have or suffer or are related 
<A NAME="296"></A>to something else that is one, but the things that are primarily called 
<A NAME="297"></A>one are those whose substance is one,-and one either in continuity or in 
<A NAME="298"></A>form or in definition; for we count as more than one either things that 
<A NAME="299"></A>are not continuous, or those whose form is not one, or those whose definition 
<A NAME="300"></A>is not one. <BR><BR>"While in a sense we call anything one if it is a quantity 
<A NAME="301"></A>and continuous, in a sense we do not unless it is a whole, i.e. unless 
<A NAME="302"></A>it has unity of form; e.g. if we saw the parts of a shoe put together anyhow 
<A NAME="303"></A>we should not call them one all the same (unless because of their continuity); 
<A NAME="304"></A>we do this only if they are put together so as to be a shoe and to have 
<A NAME="305"></A>already a certain single form. This is why the circle is of all lines most 
<A NAME="306"></A>truly one, because it is whole and complete. <BR><BR>"(3) The essence of 
<A NAME="307"></A>what is one is to be some kind of beginning of number; for the first measure 
<A NAME="308"></A>is the beginning, since that by which we first know each class is the first 
<A NAME="309"></A>measure of the class; the one, then, is the beginning of the knowable regarding 
<A NAME="310"></A>each class. But the one is not the same in all classes. For here it is 
<A NAME="311"></A>a quarter-tone, and there it is the vowel or the consonant; and there is 
<A NAME="312"></A>another unit of weight and another of movement. But everywhere the one 
<A NAME="313"></A>is indivisible either in quantity or in kind. Now that which is indivisible 
<A NAME="314"></A>in quantity is called a unit if it is not divisible in any dimension and 
<A NAME="315"></A>is without position, a point if it is not divisible in any dimension and 
<A NAME="316"></A>has position, a line if it is divisible in one dimension, a plane if in 
<A NAME="317"></A>two, a body if divisible in quantity in all--i.e. in three--dimensions. 
<A NAME="318"></A>And, reversing the order, that which is divisible in two dimensions is 
<A NAME="319"></A>a plane, that which is divisible in one a line, that which is in no way 
<A NAME="320"></A>divisible in quantity is a point or a unit,-that which has not position 
<A NAME="321"></A>a unit, that which has position a point. <BR><BR>"Again, some things are 
<A NAME="322"></A>one in number, others in species, others in genus, others by analogy; in 
<A NAME="323"></A>number those whose matter is one, in species those whose definition is 
<A NAME="324"></A>one, in genus those to which the same figure of predication applies, by 
<A NAME="325"></A>analogy those which are related as a third thing is to a fourth. The latter 
<A NAME="326"></A>kinds of unity are always found when the former are; e.g. things that are 
<A NAME="327"></A>one in number are also one in species, while things that are one in species 
<A NAME="328"></A>are not all one in number; but things that are one in species are all one 
<A NAME="329"></A>in genus, while things that are so in genus are not all one in species 
<A NAME="330"></A>but are all one by analogy; while things that are one by analogy are not 
<A NAME="331"></A>all one in genus. <BR><BR>"Evidently 'many' will have meanings opposite 
<A NAME="332"></A>to those of 'one'; some things are many because they are not continuous, 
<A NAME="333"></A>others because their matter-either the proximate matter or the ultimate-is 
<A NAME="334"></A>divisible in kind, others because the definitions which state their essence 
<A NAME="335"></A>are more than one.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="336"></A><B>Part 7</B>
<A NAME="337"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>"Things are said to 'be' (1) in an accidental sense, (2) by their 
<A NAME="339"></A>own nature. <BR><BR>"(1) In an accidental sense, e.g. we say 'the righteous 
<A NAME="340"></A>doer is musical', and 'the man is musical', and 'the musician is a man', 
<A NAME="341"></A>just as we say 'the musician builds', because the builder happens to be 
<A NAME="342"></A>musical or the musician to be a builder; for here 'one thing is another' 
<A NAME="343"></A>means 'one is an accident of another'. So in the cases we have mentioned; 
<A NAME="344"></A>for when we say 'the man is musical' and 'the musician is a man', or 'he 
<A NAME="345"></A>who is pale is musical' or 'the musician is pale', the last two mean that 
<A NAME="346"></A>both attributes are accidents of the same thing; the first that the attribute 
<A NAME="347"></A>is an accident of that which is, while 'the musical is a man' means that 
<A NAME="348"></A>'musical' is an accident of a man. (In this sense, too, the not-pale is 
<A NAME="349"></A>said to be, because that of which it is an accident is.) Thus when one 
<A NAME="350"></A>thing is said in an accidental sense to be another, this is either because 
<A NAME="351"></A>both belong to the same thing, and this is, or because that to which the 
<A NAME="352"></A>attribute belongs is, or because the subject which has as an attribute 
<A NAME="353"></A>that of which it is itself predicated, itself is. <BR><BR>"(2) The kinds 
<A NAME="354"></A>of essential being are precisely those that are indicated by the figures 
<A NAME="355"></A>of predication; for the senses of 'being' are just as many as these figures. 
<A NAME="356"></A>Since, then, some predicates indicate what the subject is, others its quality, 
<A NAME="357"></A>others quantity, others relation, others activity or passivity, others 
<A NAME="358"></A>its 'where', others its 'when', 'being' has a meaning answering to each 
<A NAME="359"></A>of these. For there is no difference between 'the man is recovering' and 
<A NAME="360"></A>'the man recovers', nor between 'the man is walking or cutting' and 'the 
<A NAME="361"></A>man walks' or 'cuts'; and similarly in all other cases. <BR><BR>"(3) Again, 
<A NAME="362"></A>'being' and 'is' mean that a statement is true, 'not being' that it is 
<A NAME="363"></A>not true but falses-and this alike in the case of affirmation and of negation; 
<A NAME="364"></A>e.g. 'Socrates is musical' means that this is true, or 'Socrates is not-pale' 
<A NAME="365"></A>means that this is true; but 'the diagonal of the square is not commensurate 
<A NAME="366"></A>with the side' means that it is false to say it is. <BR><BR>"(4) Again, 
<A NAME="367"></A>'being' and 'that which is' mean that some of the things we have mentioned 
<A NAME="368"></A>'are' potentially, others in complete reality. For we say both of that 
<A NAME="369"></A>which sees potentially and of that which sees actually, that it is 'seeing', 
<A NAME="370"></A>and both of that which can actualize its knowledge and of that which is 
<A NAME="371"></A>actualizing it, that it knows, and both of that to which rest is already 
<A NAME="372"></A>present and of that which can rest, that it rests. And similarly in the 
<A NAME="373"></A>case of substances; we say the Hermes is in the stone, and the half of 
<A NAME="374"></A>the line is in the line, and we say of that which is not yet ripe that 
<A NAME="375"></A>it is corn. When a thing is potential and when it is not yet potential 
<A NAME="376"></A>must be explained elsewhere.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="377"></A><B>Part 8</B>
<A NAME="378"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>"We call 'substance' (1) the simple bodies, i.e. earth and fire 
<A NAME="380"></A>and water and everything of the sort, and in general bodies and the things 
<A NAME="381"></A>composed of them, both animals and divine beings, and the parts of these. 
<A NAME="382"></A>All these are called substance because they are not predicated of a subject 
<A NAME="383"></A>but everything else is predicated of them.-(2) That which, being present 
<A NAME="384"></A>in such things as are not predicated of a subject, is the cause of their 
<A NAME="385"></A>being, as the soul is of the being of an animal.-(3) The parts which are 
<A NAME="386"></A>present in such things, limiting them and marking them as individuals, 
<A NAME="387"></A>and by whose destruction the whole is destroyed, as the body is by the 
<A NAME="388"></A>destruction of the plane, as some say, and the plane by the destruction 
<A NAME="389"></A>of the line; and in general number is thought by some to be of this nature; 
<A NAME="390"></A>for if it is destroyed, they say, nothing exists, and it limits all things.-(4) 
<A NAME="391"></A>The essence, the formula of which is a definition, is also called the substance 
<A NAME="392"></A>of each thing. <BR><BR>"It follows, then, that 'substance' has two senses, 
<A NAME="393"></A>(A) ultimate substratum, which is no longer predicated of anything else, 
<A NAME="394"></A>and (B) that which, being a 'this', is also separable and of this nature 
<A NAME="395"></A>is the shape or form of each thing.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="396"></A><B>Part 9</B>
<A NAME="397"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>"'The same' means (1) that which is the same in an accidental sense, 
<A NAME="399"></A>e.g. 'the pale' and 'the musical' are the same because they are accidents 
<A NAME="400"></A>of the same thing, and 'a man' and 'musical' because the one is an accident 
<A NAME="401"></A>of the other; and 'the musical' is 'a man' because it is an accident of 
<A NAME="402"></A>the man. (The complex entity is the same as either of the simple ones and 
<A NAME="403"></A>each of these is the same as it; for both 'the man' and 'the musical' are 
<A NAME="404"></A>said to be the same as 'the musical man', and this the same as they.) This 
<A NAME="405"></A>is why all of these statements are made not universally; for it is not 
<A NAME="406"></A>true to say that every man is the same as 'the musical' (for universal 
<A NAME="407"></A>attributes belong to things in virtue of their own nature, but accidents 
<A NAME="408"></A>do not belong to them in virtue of their own nature); but of the individuals 
<A NAME="409"></A>the statements are made without qualification. For 'Socrates' and 'musical 
<A NAME="410"></A>Socrates' are thought to be the same; but 'Socrates' is not predicable 
<A NAME="411"></A>of more than one subject, and therefore we do not say 'every Socrates' 
<A NAME="412"></A>as we say 'every man'. <BR><BR>"Some things are said to be the same in 
<A NAME="413"></A>this sense, others (2) are the same by their own nature, in as many senses 
<A NAME="414"></A>as that which is one by its own nature is so; for both the things whose 
<A NAME="415"></A>matter is one either in kind or in number, and those whose essence is one, 
<A NAME="416"></A>are said to be the same. Clearly, therefore, sameness is a unity of the 
<A NAME="417"></A>being either of more than one thing or of one thing when it is treated 
<A NAME="418"></A>as more than one, ie. when we say a thing is the same as itself; for we 
<A NAME="419"></A>treat it as two. <BR><BR>"Things are called 'other' if either their kinds 
<A NAME="420"></A>or their matters or the definitions of their essence are more than one; 
<A NAME="421"></A>and in general 'other' has meanings opposite to those of 'the same'. <BR><BR>"'Different' 
<A NAME="422"></A>is applied (1) to those things which though other are the same in some 
<A NAME="423"></A>respect, only not in number but either in species or in genus or by analogy; 
<A NAME="424"></A>(2) to those whose genus is other, and to contraries, and to an things 
<A NAME="425"></A>that have their otherness in their essence. <BR><BR>"Those things are called 
<A NAME="426"></A>'like' which have the same attributes in every respect, and those which 
<A NAME="427"></A>have more attributes the same than different, and those whose quality is 
<A NAME="428"></A>one; and that which shares with another thing the greater number or the 
<A NAME="429"></A>more important of the attributes (each of them one of two contraries) in 
<A NAME="430"></A>respect of which things are capable of altering, is like that other thing. 
<A NAME="431"></A>The senses of 'unlike' are opposite to those of 'like'.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="432"></A><B>Part 10</B>
<A NAME="433"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>"The term 'opposite' is applied to contradictories, and to contraries, 
<A NAME="435"></A>and to relative terms, and to privation and possession, and to the extremes 
<A NAME="436"></A>from which and into which generation and dissolution take place; and the 
<A NAME="437"></A>attributes that cannot be present at the same time in that which is receptive 
<A NAME="438"></A>of both, are said to be opposed,-either themselves of their constituents. 
<A NAME="439"></A>Grey and white colour do not belong at the same time to the same thing; 
<A NAME="440"></A>hence their constituents are opposed. <BR><BR>"The term 'contrary' is applied 
<A NAME="441"></A>(1) to those attributes differing in genus which cannot belong at the same 
<A NAME="442"></A>time to the same subject, (2) to the most different of the things in the 
<A NAME="443"></A>same genus, (3) to the most different of the attributes in the same recipient 
<A NAME="444"></A>subject, (4) to the most different of the things that fall under the same 
<A NAME="445"></A>faculty, (5) to the things whose difference is greatest either absolutely 
<A NAME="446"></A>or in genus or in species. The other things that are called contrary are 
<A NAME="447"></A>so called, some because they possess contraries of the above kind, some 
<A NAME="448"></A>because they are receptive of such, some because they are productive of 
<A NAME="449"></A>or susceptible to such, or are producing or suffering them, or are losses 
<A NAME="450"></A>or acquisitions, or possessions or privations, of such. Since 'one' and 
<A NAME="451"></A>'being' have many senses, the other terms which are derived from these, 
<A NAME="452"></A>and therefore 'same', 'other', and 'contrary', must correspond, so that 
<A NAME="453"></A>they must be different for each category. <BR><BR>"The term 'other in species' 
<A NAME="454"></A>is applied to things which being of the same genus are not subordinate 
<A NAME="455"></A>the one to the other, or which being in the same genus have a difference, 
<A NAME="456"></A>or which have a contrariety in their substance; and contraries are other 
<A NAME="457"></A>than one another in species (either all contraries or those which are so 
<A NAME="458"></A>called in the primary sense), and so are those things whose definitions 
<A NAME="459"></A>differ in the infima species of the genus (e.g. man and horse are indivisible 
<A NAME="460"></A>in genus, but their definitions are different), and those which being in 
<A NAME="461"></A>the same substance have a difference. 'The same in species' has the various 
<A NAME="462"></A>meanings opposite to these.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="463"></A><B>Part 11</B>
<A NAME="464"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>"The words 'prior' and 'posterior' are applied (1) to some things 
<A NAME="466"></A>(on the assumption that there is a first, i.e. a beginning, in each class) 
<A NAME="467"></A>because they are nearer some beginning determined either absolutely and 
<A NAME="468"></A>by nature, or by reference to something or in some place or by certain 
<A NAME="469"></A>people; e.g. things are prior in place because they are nearer either to 
<A NAME="470"></A>some place determined by nature (e.g. the middle or the last place), or 
<A NAME="471"></A>to some chance object; and that which is farther is posterior.-Other things 
<A NAME="472"></A>are prior in time; some by being farther from the present, i.e. in the 
<A NAME="473"></A>case of past events (for the Trojan war is prior to the Persian, because 
<A NAME="474"></A>it is farther from the present), others by being nearer the present, i.e. 
<A NAME="475"></A>in the case of future events (for the Nemean games are prior to the Pythian, 
<A NAME="476"></A>if we treat the present as beginning and first point, because they are 
<A NAME="477"></A>nearer the present).-Other things are prior in movement; for that which 
<A NAME="478"></A>is nearer the first mover is prior (e.g. the boy is prior to the man); 
<A NAME="479"></A>and the prime mover also is a beginning absolutely.-Others are prior in 
<A NAME="480"></A>power; for that which exceeds in power, i.e. the more powerful, is prior; 
<A NAME="481"></A>and such is that according to whose will the other-i.e. the posterior-must 
<A NAME="482"></A>follow, so that if the prior does not set it in motion the other does not 
<A NAME="483"></A>move, and if it sets it in motion it does move; and here will is a beginning.-Others 
<A NAME="484"></A>are prior in arrangement; these are the things that are placed at intervals 
<A NAME="485"></A>in reference to some one definite thing according to some rule, e.g. in 
<A NAME="486"></A>the chorus the second man is prior to the third, and in the lyre the second 
<A NAME="487"></A>lowest string is prior to the lowest; for in the one case the leader and 
<A NAME="488"></A>in the other the middle string is the beginning. <BR><BR>"These, then, 
<A NAME="489"></A>are called prior in this sense, but (2) in another sense that which is 
<A NAME="490"></A>prior for knowledge is treated as also absolutely prior; of these, the 
<A NAME="491"></A>things that are prior in definition do not coincide with those that are 
<A NAME="492"></A>prior in relation to perception. For in definition universals are prior, 
<A NAME="493"></A>in relation to perception individuals. And in definition also the accident 
<A NAME="494"></A>is prior to the whole, e.g. 'musical' to 'musical man', for the definition 
<A NAME="495"></A>cannot exist as a whole without the part; yet musicalness cannot exist 
<A NAME="496"></A>unless there is some one who is musical. <BR><BR>"(3) The attributes of 
<A NAME="497"></A>prior things are called prior, e.g. straightness is prior to smoothness; 
<A NAME="498"></A>for one is an attribute of a line as such, and the other of a surface. 
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR>"Some things then are called prior and posterior in this sense, 
<A NAME="500"></A>others (4) in respect of nature and substance, i.e. those which can be 
<A NAME="501"></A>without other things, while the others cannot be without them,-a distinction 
<A NAME="502"></A>which Plato used. (If we consider the various senses of 'being', firstly 
<A NAME="503"></A>the subject is prior, so that substance is prior; secondly, according as 
<A NAME="504"></A>potency or complete reality is taken into account, different things are 
<A NAME="505"></A>prior, for some things are prior in respect of potency, others in respect 
<A NAME="506"></A>of complete reality, e.g. in potency the half line is prior to the whole 
<A NAME="507"></A>line, and the part to the whole, and the matter to the concrete substance, 
<A NAME="508"></A>but in complete reality these are posterior; for it is only when the whole 
<A NAME="509"></A>has been dissolved that they will exist in complete reality.) In a sense, 
<A NAME="510"></A>therefore, all things that are called prior and posterior are so called 
<A NAME="511"></A>with reference to this fourth sense; for some things can exist without 
<A NAME="512"></A>others in respect of generation, e.g. the whole without the parts, and 
<A NAME="513"></A>others in respect of dissolution, e.g. the part without the whole. And 
<A NAME="514"></A>the same is true in all other cases.

<A NAME="515"></A><B>Part 12</B>
<A NAME="516"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>"'Potency' means (1) a source of movement or change, which is in 
<A NAME="518"></A>another thing than the thing moved or in the same thing qua other; e.g. 
<A NAME="519"></A>the art of building is a potency which is not in the thing built, while 
<A NAME="520"></A>the art of healing, which is a potency, may be in the man healed, but not 
<A NAME="521"></A>in him qua healed. 'Potency' then means the source, in general, of change 
<A NAME="522"></A>or movement in another thing or in the same thing qua other, and also (2) 
<A NAME="523"></A>the source of a thing's being moved by another thing or by itself qua other. 
<A NAME="524"></A>For in virtue of that principle, in virtue of which a patient suffers anything, 
<A NAME="525"></A>we call it 'capable' of suffering; and this we do sometimes if it suffers 
<A NAME="526"></A>anything at all, sometimes not in respect of everything it suffers, but 
<A NAME="527"></A>only if it suffers a change for the better--(3) The capacity of performing 
<A NAME="528"></A>this well or according to intention; for sometimes we say of those who 
<A NAME="529"></A>merely can walk or speak but not well or not as they intend, that they 
<A NAME="530"></A>cannot speak or walk. So too (4) in the case of passivity--(5) The states 
<A NAME="531"></A>in virtue of which things are absolutely impassive or unchangeable, or 
<A NAME="532"></A>not easily changed for the worse, are called potencies; for things are 
<A NAME="533"></A>broken and crushed and bent and in general destroyed not by having a potency 
<A NAME="534"></A>but by not having one and by lacking something, and things are impassive 
<A NAME="535"></A>with respect to such processes if they are scarcely and slightly affected 
<A NAME="536"></A>by them, because of a 'potency' and because they 'can' do something and 
<A NAME="537"></A>are in some positive state. <BR><BR>"'Potency' having this variety of meanings, 
<A NAME="538"></A>so too the 'potent' or 'capable' in one sense will mean that which can 
<A NAME="539"></A>begin a movement (or a change in general, for even that which can bring 
<A NAME="540"></A>things to rest is a 'potent' thing) in another thing or in itself qua other; 
<A NAME="541"></A>and in one sense that over which something else has such a potency; and 
<A NAME="542"></A>in one sense that which has a potency of changing into something, whether 
<A NAME="543"></A>for the worse or for the better (for even that which perishes is thought 
<A NAME="544"></A>to be 'capable' of perishing, for it would not have perished if it had 
<A NAME="545"></A>not been capable of it; but, as a matter of fact, it has a certain disposition 
<A NAME="546"></A>and cause and principle which fits it to suffer this; sometimes it is thought 
<A NAME="547"></A>to be of this sort because it has something, sometimes because it is deprived 
<A NAME="548"></A>of something; but if privation is in a sense 'having' or 'habit', everything 
<A NAME="549"></A>will be capable by having something, so that things are capable both by 
<A NAME="550"></A>having a positive habit and principle, and by having the privation of this, 
<A NAME="551"></A>if it is possible to have a privation; and if privation is not in a sense 
<A NAME="552"></A>'habit', 'capable' is used in two distinct senses); and a thing is capable 
<A NAME="553"></A>in another sense because neither any other thing, nor itself qua other, 
<A NAME="554"></A>has a potency or principle which can destroy it. Again, all of these are 
<A NAME="555"></A>capable either merely because the thing might chance to happen or not to 
<A NAME="556"></A>happen, or because it might do so well. This sort of potency is found even 
<A NAME="557"></A>in lifeless things, e.g. in instruments; for we say one lyre can speak, 
<A NAME="558"></A>and another cannot speak at all, if it has not a good tone. <BR><BR>"Incapacity 
<A NAME="559"></A>is privation of capacity-i.e. of such a principle as has been described 
<A NAME="560"></A>either in general or in the case of something that would naturally have 
<A NAME="561"></A>the capacity, or even at the time when it would naturally already have 
<A NAME="562"></A>it; for the senses in which we should call a boy and a man and a eunuch 
<A NAME="563"></A>'incapable of begetting' are distinct.-Again, to either kind of capacity 
<A NAME="564"></A>there is an opposite incapacity-both to that which only can produce movement 
<A NAME="565"></A>and to that which can produce it well. <BR><BR>"Some things, then, are 
<A NAME="566"></A>called adunata in virtue of this kind of incapacity, while others are so 
<A NAME="567"></A>in another sense; i.e. both dunaton and adunaton are used as follows. The 
<A NAME="568"></A>impossible is that of which the contrary is of necessity true, e.g. that 
<A NAME="569"></A>the diagonal of a square is commensurate with the side is impossible, because 
<A NAME="570"></A>such a statement is a falsity of which the contrary is not only true but 
<A NAME="571"></A>also necessary; that it is commensurate, then, is not only false but also 
<A NAME="572"></A>of necessity false. The contrary of this, the possible, is found when it 
<A NAME="573"></A>is not necessary that the contrary is false, e.g. that a man should be 
<A NAME="574"></A>seated is possible; for that he is not seated is not of necessity false. 
<A NAME="575"></A>The possible, then, in one sense, as has been said, means that which is 
<A NAME="576"></A>not of necessity false; in one, that which is true; in one, that which 
<A NAME="577"></A>may be true.-A 'potency' or 'power' in geometry is so called by a change 
<A NAME="578"></A>of meaning.-These senses of 'capable' or 'possible' involve no reference 
<A NAME="579"></A>to potency. But the senses which involve a reference to potency all refer 
<A NAME="580"></A>to the primary kind of potency; and this is a source of change in another 
<A NAME="581"></A>thing or in the same thing qua other. For other things are called 'capable', 
<A NAME="582"></A>some because something else has such a potency over them, some because 
<A NAME="583"></A>it has not, some because it has it in a particular way. The same is true 
<A NAME="584"></A>of the things that are incapable. Therefore the proper definition of the 
<A NAME="585"></A>primary kind of potency will be 'a source of change in another thing or 
<A NAME="586"></A>in the same thing qua other'.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="587"></A><B>Part 13</B>
<A NAME="588"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>"'Quantum' means that which is divisible into two or more constituent 
<A NAME="590"></A>parts of which each is by nature a 'one' and a 'this'. A quantum is a plurality 
<A NAME="591"></A>if it is numerable, a magnitude if it is a measurable. 'Plurality' means 
<A NAME="592"></A>that which is divisible potentially into non-continuous parts, 'magnitude' 
<A NAME="593"></A>that which is divisible into continuous parts; of magnitude, that which 
<A NAME="594"></A>is continuous in one dimension is length; in two breadth, in three depth. 
<A NAME="595"></A>Of these, limited plurality is number, limited length is a line, breadth 
<A NAME="596"></A>a surface, depth a solid. <BR><BR>"Again, some things are called quanta 
<A NAME="597"></A>in virtue of their own nature, others incidentally; e.g. the line is a 
<A NAME="598"></A>quantum by its own nature, the musical is one incidentally. Of the things 
<A NAME="599"></A>that are quanta by their own nature some are so as substances, e.g. the 
<A NAME="600"></A>line is a quantum (for 'a certain kind of quantum' is present in the definition 
<A NAME="601"></A>which states what it is), and others are modifications and states of this 
<A NAME="602"></A>kind of substance, e.g. much and little, long and short, broad and narrow, 
<A NAME="603"></A>deep and shallow, heavy and light, and all other such attributes. And also 
<A NAME="604"></A>great and small, and greater and smaller, both in themselves and when taken 
<A NAME="605"></A>relatively to each other, are by their own nature attributes of what is 
<A NAME="606"></A>quantitative; but these names are transferred to other things also. Of 
<A NAME="607"></A>things that are quanta incidentally, some are so called in the sense in 
<A NAME="608"></A>which it was said that the musical and the white were quanta, viz. because 
<A NAME="609"></A>that to which musicalness and whiteness belong is a quantum, and some are 
<A NAME="610"></A>quanta in the way in which movement and time are so; for these also are 
<A NAME="611"></A>called quanta of a sort and continuous because the things of which these 
<A NAME="612"></A>are attributes are divisible. I mean not that which is moved, but the space 
<A NAME="613"></A>through which it is moved; for because that is a quantum movement also 
<A NAME="614"></A>is a quantum, and because this is a quantum time is 
<A NAME="615"></A>one.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="616"></A><B>Part 14</B>
<A NAME="617"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR>"'Quality' means (1) the differentia of the essence, e.g. man is 
<A NAME="619"></A>an animal of a certain quality because he is two-footed, and the horse 
<A NAME="620"></A>is so because it is four-footed; and a circle is a figure of particular 
<A NAME="621"></A>quality because it is without angles,-which shows that the essential differentia 
<A NAME="622"></A>is a quality.-This, then, is one meaning of quality-the differentia of 
<A NAME="623"></A>the essence, but (2) there is another sense in which it applies to the 
<A NAME="624"></A>unmovable objects of mathematics, the sense in which the numbers have a 
<A NAME="625"></A>certain quality, e.g. the composite numbers which are not in one dimension 
<A NAME="626"></A>only, but of which the plane and the solid are copies (these are those 
<A NAME="627"></A>which have two or three factors); and in general that which exists in the 
<A NAME="628"></A>essence of numbers besides quantity is quality; for the essence of each 
<A NAME="629"></A>is what it is once, e.g. that of is not what it is twice or thrice, but 
<A NAME="630"></A>what it is once; for 6 is once 6. <BR><BR>"(3) All the modifications of 
<A NAME="631"></A>substances that move (e.g. heat and cold, whiteness and blackness, heaviness 
<A NAME="632"></A>and lightness, and the others of the sort) in virtue of which, when they 
<A NAME="633"></A>change, bodies are said to alter. (4) Quality in respect of virtue and 
<A NAME="634"></A>vice, and in general, of evil and good. <BR><BR>"Quality, then, seems to 
<A NAME="635"></A>have practically two meanings, and one of these is the more proper. The 
<A NAME="636"></A>primary quality is the differentia of the essence, and of this the quality 
<A NAME="637"></A>in numbers is a part; for it is a differentia of essences, but either not 
<A NAME="638"></A>of things that move or not of them qua moving. Secondly, there are the 
<A NAME="639"></A>modifications of things that move, qua moving, and the differentiae of 
<A NAME="640"></A>movements. Virtue and vice fall among these modifications; for they indicate 
<A NAME="641"></A>differentiae of the movement or activity, according to which the things 
<A NAME="642"></A>in motion act or are acted on well or badly; for that which can be moved 
<A NAME="643"></A>or act in one way is good, and that which can do so in another--the contrary--way 
<A NAME="644"></A>is vicious. Good and evil indicate quality especially in living things, 
<A NAME="645"></A>and among these especially in those which have purpose.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="646"></A><B>Part 15</B>
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR>"Things are 'relative' (1) as double to half, and treble to a third, 
<A NAME="648"></A>and in general that which contains something else many times to that which 
<A NAME="649"></A>is contained many times in something else, and that which exceeds to that 
<A NAME="650"></A>which is exceeded; (2) as that which can heat to that which can be heated, 
<A NAME="651"></A>and that which can cut to that which can be cut, and in general the active 
<A NAME="652"></A>to the passive; (3) as the measurable to the measure, and the knowable 
<A NAME="653"></A>to knowledge, and the perceptible to perception. <BR><BR>"(1) Relative 
<A NAME="654"></A>terms of the first kind are numerically related either indefinitely or 
<A NAME="655"></A>definitely, to numbers themselves or to 1. E.g. the double is in a definite 
<A NAME="656"></A>numerical relation to 1, and that which is 'many times as great' is in 
<A NAME="657"></A>a numerical, but not a definite, relation to 1, i.e. not in this or in 
<A NAME="658"></A>that numerical relation to it; the relation of that which is half as big 
<A NAME="659"></A>again as something else to that something is a definite numerical relation 
<A NAME="660"></A>to a number; that which is n+I/n times something else is in an indefinite 
<A NAME="661"></A>relation to that something, as that which is 'many times as great' is in 
<A NAME="662"></A>an indefinite relation to 1; the relation of that which exceeds to that 
<A NAME="663"></A>which is exceeded is numerically quite indefinite; for number is always 
<A NAME="664"></A>commensurate, and 'number' is not predicated of that which is not commensurate, 
<A NAME="665"></A>but that which exceeds is, in relation to that which is exceeded, so much 
<A NAME="666"></A>and something more; and this something is indefinite; for it can, indifferently, 
<A NAME="667"></A>be either equal or not equal to that which is exceeded.-All these relations, 
<A NAME="668"></A>then, are numerically expressed and are determinations of number, and so 
<A NAME="669"></A>in another way are the equal and the like and the same. For all refer to 
<A NAME="670"></A>unity. Those things are the same whose substance is one; those are like 
<A NAME="671"></A>whose quality is one; those are equal whose quantity is one; and 1 is the 
<A NAME="672"></A>beginning and measure of number, so that all these relations imply number, 
<A NAME="673"></A>though not in the same way. <BR><BR>"(2) Things that are active or passive 
<A NAME="674"></A>imply an active or a passive potency and the actualizations of the potencies; 
<A NAME="675"></A>e.g. that which is capable of heating is related to that which is capable 
<A NAME="676"></A>of being heated, because it can heat it, and, again, that which heats is 
<A NAME="677"></A>related to that which is heated and that which cuts to that which is cut, 
<A NAME="678"></A>in the sense that they actually do these things. But numerical relations 
<A NAME="679"></A>are not actualized except in the sense which has been elsewhere stated; 
<A NAME="680"></A>actualizations in the sense of movement they have not. Of relations which 
<A NAME="681"></A>imply potency some further imply particular periods of time, e.g. that 
<A NAME="682"></A>which has made is relative to that which has been made, and that which 
<A NAME="683"></A>will make to that which will be made. For it is in this way that a father 
<A NAME="684"></A>is called the father of his son; for the one has acted and the other has 
<A NAME="685"></A>been acted on in a certain way. Further, some relative terms imply privation 
<A NAME="686"></A>of potency, i.e. 'incapable' and terms of this sort, e.g. 'invisible'. 
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR>"Relative terms which imply number or potency, therefore, are all 
<A NAME="688"></A>relative because their very essence includes in its nature a reference 
<A NAME="689"></A>to something else, not because something else involves a reference to it; 
<A NAME="690"></A>but (3) that which is measurable or knowable or thinkable is called relative 
<A NAME="691"></A>because something else involves a reference to it. For 'that which is thinkable' 
<A NAME="692"></A>implies that the thought of it is possible, but the thought is not relative 
<A NAME="693"></A>to 'that of which it is the thought'; for we should then have said the 
<A NAME="694"></A>same thing twice. Similarly sight is the sight of something, not 'of that 
<A NAME="695"></A>of which it is the sight' (though of course it is true to say this); in 
<A NAME="696"></A>fact it is relative to colour or to something else of the sort. But according 
<A NAME="697"></A>to the other way of speaking the same thing would be said twice,-'the sight 
<A NAME="698"></A>is of that of which it is.' <BR><BR>"Things that are by their own nature 
<A NAME="699"></A>called relative are called so sometimes in these senses, sometimes if the 
<A NAME="700"></A>classes that include them are of this sort; e.g. medicine is a relative 
<A NAME="701"></A>term because its genus, science, is thought to be a relative term. Further, 
<A NAME="702"></A>there are the properties in virtue of which the things that have them are 
<A NAME="703"></A>called relative, e.g. equality is relative because the equal is, and likeness 
<A NAME="704"></A>because the like is. Other things are relative by accident; e.g. a man 
<A NAME="705"></A>is relative because he happens to be double of something and double is 
<A NAME="706"></A>a relative term; or the white is relative, if the same thing happens to 
<A NAME="707"></A>be double and white.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="708"></A><B>Part 16</B>
<A NAME="709"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR>"What is called 'complete' is (1) that outside which it is not 
<A NAME="711"></A>possible to find any, even one, of its parts; e.g. the complete time of 
<A NAME="712"></A>each thing is that outside which it is not possible to find any time which 
<A NAME="713"></A>is a part proper to it.-(2) That which in respect of excellence and goodness 
<A NAME="714"></A>cannot be excelled in its kind; e.g. we have a complete doctor or a complete 
<A NAME="715"></A>flute-player, when they lack nothing in respect of the form of their proper 
<A NAME="716"></A>excellence. And thus, transferring the word to bad things, we speak of 
<A NAME="717"></A>a complete scandal-monger and a complete thief; indeed we even call them 
<A NAME="718"></A>good, i.e. a good thief and a good scandal-monger. And excellence is a 
<A NAME="719"></A>completion; for each thing is complete and every substance is complete, 
<A NAME="720"></A>when in respect of the form of its proper excellence it lacks no part of 
<A NAME="721"></A>its natural magnitude.-(3) The things which have attained their end, this 
<A NAME="722"></A>being good, are called complete; for things are complete in virtue of having 
<A NAME="723"></A>attained their end. Therefore, since the end is something ultimate, we 
<A NAME="724"></A>transfer the word to bad things and say a thing has been completely spoilt, 
<A NAME="725"></A>and completely destroyed, when it in no wise falls short of destruction 
<A NAME="726"></A>and badness, but is at its last point. This is why death, too, is by a 
<A NAME="727"></A>figure of speech called the end, because both are last things. But the 
<A NAME="728"></A>ultimate purpose is also an end.-Things, then, that are called complete 
<A NAME="729"></A>in virtue of their own nature are so called in all these senses, some because 
<A NAME="730"></A>in respect of goodness they lack nothing and cannot be excelled and no 
<A NAME="731"></A>part proper to them can be found outside them, others in general because 
<A NAME="732"></A>they cannot be exceeded in their several classes and no part proper to 
<A NAME="733"></A>them is outside them; the others presuppose these first two kinds, and 
<A NAME="734"></A>are called complete because they either make or have something of the sort 
<A NAME="735"></A>or are adapted to it or in some way or other involve a reference to the 
<A NAME="736"></A>things that are called complete in the primary sense.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="737"></A><B>Part 17</B>
<A NAME="738"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>"'Limit' means (1) the last point of each thing, i.e. the first 
<A NAME="740"></A>point beyond which it is not possible to find any part, and the first point 
<A NAME="741"></A>within which every part is; (2) the form, whatever it may be, of a spatial 
<A NAME="742"></A>magnitude or of a thing that has magnitude; (3) the end of each thing (and 
<A NAME="743"></A>of this nature is that towards which the movement and the action are, not 
<A NAME="744"></A>that from which they are-though sometimes it is both, that from which and 
<A NAME="745"></A>that to which the movement is, i.e. the final cause); (4) the substance 
<A NAME="746"></A>of each thing, and the essence of each; for this is the limit of knowledge; 
<A NAME="747"></A>and if of knowledge, of the object also. Evidently, therefore, 'limit' 
<A NAME="748"></A>has as many senses as 'beginning', and yet more; for the beginning is a 
<A NAME="749"></A>limit, but not every limit is a beginning.

<A NAME="750"></A><B>Part 18</B>
<A NAME="751"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR>"'That in virtue of which' has several meanings:-(1) the form or 
<A NAME="753"></A>substance of each thing, e.g. that in virtue of which a man is good is 
<A NAME="754"></A>the good itself, (2) the proximate subject in which it is the nature of 
<A NAME="755"></A>an attribute to be found, e.g. colour in a surface. 'That in virtue of 
<A NAME="756"></A>which', then, in the primary sense is the form, and in a secondary sense 
<A NAME="757"></A>the matter of each thing and the proximate substratum of each.-In general 
<A NAME="758"></A>'that in virtue of which' will found in the same number of senses as 'cause'; 
<A NAME="759"></A>for we say indifferently (3) in virtue of what has he come?' or 'for what 
<A NAME="760"></A>end has he come?'; and (4) in virtue of what has he inferred wrongly, or 
<A NAME="761"></A>inferred?' or 'what is the cause of the inference, or of the wrong inference?'-Further 
<A NAME="762"></A>(5) Kath' d is used in reference to position, e.g. 'at which he stands' 
<A NAME="763"></A>or 'along which he walks; for all such phrases indicate place and position. 
<A NAME="764"></A><BR><BR>"Therefore 'in virtue of itself' must likewise have several meanings. 
<A NAME="765"></A>The following belong to a thing in virtue of itself:-(1) the essence of 
<A NAME="766"></A>each thing, e.g. Callias is in virtue of himself Callias and what it was 
<A NAME="767"></A>to be Callias;-(2) whatever is present in the 'what', e.g. Callias is in 
<A NAME="768"></A>virtue of himself an animal. For 'animal' is present in his definition; 
<A NAME="769"></A>Callias is a particular animal.-(3) Whatever attribute a thing receives 
<A NAME="770"></A>in itself directly or in one of its parts; e.g. a surface is white in virtue 
<A NAME="771"></A>of itself, and a man is alive in virtue of himself; for the soul, in which 
<A NAME="772"></A>life directly resides, is a part of the man.-(4) That which has no cause 
<A NAME="773"></A>other than itself; man has more than one cause--animal, two-footed--but 
<A NAME="774"></A>yet man is man in virtue of himself.-(5) Whatever attributes belong to 
<A NAME="775"></A>a thing alone, and in so far as they belong to it merely by virtue of itself 
<A NAME="776"></A>considered apart by itself.

<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR>"'Disposition' means the arrangement of that which has parts, in 
<A NAME="780"></A>respect either of place or of potency or of kind; for there must be a certain

<A NAME="783"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="784"></A><BR><BR>"'Having' means (1) a kind of activity of the haver and of what 
<A NAME="785"></A>he has-something like an action or movement. For when one thing makes and 
<A NAME="786"></A>one is made, between them there is a making; so too between him who has 
<A NAME="787"></A>a garment and the garment which he has there is a having. This sort of 
<A NAME="788"></A>having, then, evidently we cannot have; for the process will go on to infinity, 
<A NAME="789"></A>if it is to be possible to have the having of what we have.-(2) 'Having' 
<A NAME="790"></A>or 'habit' means a disposition according to which that which is disposed 
<A NAME="791"></A>is either well or ill disposed, and either in itself or with reference 
<A NAME="792"></A>to something else; e.g. health is a 'habit'; for it is such a disposition.-(3) 
<A NAME="793"></A>We speak of a 'habit' if there is a portion of such a disposition; and 
<A NAME="794"></A>so even the excellence of the parts is a 'habit' of the whole 
<A NAME="795"></A>thing.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="796"></A><B>Part 21</B>
<A NAME="797"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR>"'Affection' means (1) a quality in respect of which a thing can 
<A NAME="799"></A>be altered, e.g. white and black, sweet and bitter, heaviness and lightness, 
<A NAME="800"></A>and all others of the kind.-(2) The actualization of these-the already 
<A NAME="801"></A>accomplished alterations.-(3) Especially, injurious alterations and movements, 
<A NAME="802"></A>and, above all painful injuries.-(4) Misfortunes and painful experiences 
<A NAME="803"></A>when on a large scale are called affections.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="804"></A><B>Part 22</B>
<A NAME="805"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR>"We speak of 'privation' (1) if something has not one of the attributes 
<A NAME="807"></A>which a thing might naturally have, even if this thing itself would not 
<A NAME="808"></A>naturally have it; e.g. a plant is said to be 'deprived' of eyes.-(2) If, 
<A NAME="809"></A>though either the thing itself or its genus would naturally have an attribute, 
<A NAME="810"></A>it has it not; e.g. a blind man and a mole are in different senses 'deprived' 
<A NAME="811"></A>of sight; the latter in contrast with its genus, the former in contrast 
<A NAME="812"></A>with his own normal nature.-(3) If, though it would naturally have the 
<A NAME="813"></A>attribute, and when it would naturally have it, it has it not; for blindness 
<A NAME="814"></A>is a privation, but one is not 'blind' at any and every age, but only if 
<A NAME="815"></A>one has not sight at the age at which one would naturally have it. Similarly 
<A NAME="816"></A>a thing is called blind if it has not sight in the medium in which, and 
<A NAME="817"></A>in respect of the organ in respect of which, and with reference to the 
<A NAME="818"></A>object with reference to which, and in the circumstances in which, it would 
<A NAME="819"></A>naturally have it.-(4) The violent taking away of anything is called privation. 
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR>"Indeed there are just as many kinds of privations as there are 
<A NAME="821"></A>of words with negative prefixes; for a thing is called unequal because 
<A NAME="822"></A>it has not equality though it would naturally have it, and invisible either 
<A NAME="823"></A>because it has no colour at all or because it has a poor colour, and apodous 
<A NAME="824"></A>either because it has no feet at all or because it has imperfect feet. 
<A NAME="825"></A>Again, a privative term may be used because the thing has little of the 
<A NAME="826"></A>attribute (and this means having it in a sense imperfectly), e.g. 'kernel-less'; 
<A NAME="827"></A>or because it has it not easily or not well (e.g. we call a thing uncuttable 
<A NAME="828"></A>not only if it cannot be cut but also if it cannot be cut easily or well); 
<A NAME="829"></A>or because it has not the attribute at all; for it is not the one-eyed 
<A NAME="830"></A>man but he who is sightless in both eyes that is called blind. This is 
<A NAME="831"></A>why not every man is 'good' or 'bad', 'just' or 'unjust', but there is 
<A NAME="832"></A>also an intermediate state.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="833"></A><B>Part 23</B>
<A NAME="834"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>"To 'have' or 'hold' means many things:-(1) to treat a thing according 
<A NAME="836"></A>to one's own nature or according to one's own impulse; so that fever is 
<A NAME="837"></A>said to have a man, and tyrants to have their cities, and people to have 
<A NAME="838"></A>the clothes they wear.-(2) That in which a thing is present as in something 
<A NAME="839"></A>receptive of it is said to have the thing; e.g. the bronze has the form 
<A NAME="840"></A>of the statue, and the body has the disease.-(3) As that which contains 
<A NAME="841"></A>holds the things contained; for a thing is said to be held by that in which 
<A NAME="842"></A>it is as in a container; e.g. we say that the vessel holds the liquid and 
<A NAME="843"></A>the city holds men and the ship sailors; and so too that the whole holds 
<A NAME="844"></A>the parts.-(4) That which hinders a thing from moving or acting according 
<A NAME="845"></A>to its own impulse is said to hold it, as pillars hold the incumbent weights, 
<A NAME="846"></A>and as the poets make Atlas hold the heavens, implying that otherwise they 
<A NAME="847"></A>would collapse on the earth, as some of the natural philosophers also say. 
<A NAME="848"></A>In this way also that which holds things together is said to hold the things 
<A NAME="849"></A>it holds together, since they would otherwise separate, each according 
<A NAME="850"></A>to its own impulse. <BR><BR>"'Being in something' has similar and corresponding 
<A NAME="851"></A>meanings to 'holding' or 'having'.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="852"></A><B>Part 24</B>
<A NAME="853"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><BR>"'To come from something' means (1) to come from something as from 
<A NAME="855"></A>matter, and this in two senses, either in respect of the highest genus 
<A NAME="856"></A>or in respect of the lowest species; e.g. in a sense all things that can 
<A NAME="857"></A>be melted come from water, but in a sense the statue comes from bronze.-(2) 
<A NAME="858"></A>As from the first moving principle; e.g. 'what did the fight come from?' 
<A NAME="859"></A>From abusive language, because this was the origin of the fight.-(3) From 
<A NAME="860"></A>the compound of matter and shape, as the parts come from the whole, and 
<A NAME="861"></A>the verse from the Iliad, and the stones from the house; (in every such 
<A NAME="862"></A>case the whole is a compound of matter and shape,) for the shape is the 
<A NAME="863"></A>end, and only that which attains an end is complete.-(4) As the form from 
<A NAME="864"></A>its part, e.g. man from 'two-footed'and syllable from 'letter'; for this 
<A NAME="865"></A>is a different sense from that in which the statue comes from bronze; for 
<A NAME="866"></A>the composite substance comes from the sensible matter, but the form also 
<A NAME="867"></A>comes from the matter of the form.-Some things, then, are said to come 
<A NAME="868"></A>from something else in these senses; but (5) others are so described if 
<A NAME="869"></A>one of these senses is applicable to a part of that other thing; e.g. the 
<A NAME="870"></A>child comes from its father and mother, and plants come from the earth, 
<A NAME="871"></A>because they come from a part of those things.-(6) It means coming after 
<A NAME="872"></A>a thing in time, e.g. night comes from day and storm from fine weather, 
<A NAME="873"></A>because the one comes after the other. Of these things some are so described 
<A NAME="874"></A>because they admit of change into one another, as in the cases now mentioned; 
<A NAME="875"></A>some merely because they are successive in time, e.g. the voyage took place 
<A NAME="876"></A>'from' the equinox, because it took place after the equinox, and the festival 
<A NAME="877"></A>of the Thargelia comes 'from' the Dionysia, because after the 
<A NAME="878"></A>Dionysia.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="879"></A><B>Part 25</B>
<A NAME="880"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="881"></A><BR><BR>"'Part' means (1) (a) that into which a quantum can in any way 
<A NAME="882"></A>be divided; for that which is taken from a quantum qua quantum is always 
<A NAME="883"></A>called a part of it, e.g. two is called in a sense a part of three. It 
<A NAME="884"></A>means (b), of the parts in the first sense, only those which measure the 
<A NAME="885"></A>whole; this is why two, though in one sense it is, in another is not, called 
<A NAME="886"></A>a part of three.-(2) The elements into which a kind might be divided apart 
<A NAME="887"></A>from the quantity are also called parts of it; for which reason we say 
<A NAME="888"></A>the species are parts of the genus.-(3) The elements into which a whole 
<A NAME="889"></A>is divided, or of which it consists-the 'whole' meaning either the form 
<A NAME="890"></A>or that which has the form; e.g. of the bronze sphere or of the bronze 
<A NAME="891"></A>cube both the bronze-i.e. the matter in which the form is-and the characteristic 
<A NAME="892"></A>angle are parts.-(4) The elements in the definition which explains a thing 
<A NAME="893"></A>are also parts of the whole; this is why the genus is called a part of 
<A NAME="894"></A>the species, though in another sense the species is part of the 
<A NAME="895"></A>genus.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="896"></A><B>Part 26</B>
<A NAME="897"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="898"></A><BR><BR>"'A whole' means (1) that from which is absent none of the parts 
<A NAME="899"></A>of which it is said to be naturally a whole, and (2) that which so contains 
<A NAME="900"></A>the things it contains that they form a unity; and this in two senses-either 
<A NAME="901"></A>as being each severally one single thing, or as making up the unity between 
<A NAME="902"></A>them. For (a) that which is true of a whole class and is said to hold good 
<A NAME="903"></A>as a whole (which implies that it is a kind whole) is true of a whole in 
<A NAME="904"></A>the sense that it contains many things by being predicated of each, and 
<A NAME="905"></A>by all of them, e.g. man, horse, god, being severally one single thing, 
<A NAME="906"></A>because all are living things. But (b) the continuous and limited is a 
<A NAME="907"></A>whole, when it is a unity consisting of several parts, especially if they 
<A NAME="908"></A>are present only potentially, but, failing this, even if they are present 
<A NAME="909"></A>actually. Of these things themselves, those which are so by nature are 
<A NAME="910"></A>wholes in a higher degree than those which are so by art, as we said in 
<A NAME="911"></A>the case of unity also, wholeness being in fact a sort of oneness. <BR><BR>"Again 
<A NAME="912"></A>(3) of quanta that have a beginning and a middle and an end, those to which 
<A NAME="913"></A>the position does not make a difference are called totals, and those to 
<A NAME="914"></A>which it does, wholes. Those which admit of both descriptions are both 
<A NAME="915"></A>wholes and totals. These are the things whose nature remains the same after 
<A NAME="916"></A>transposition, but whose form does not, e.g. wax or a coat; they are called 
<A NAME="917"></A>both wholes and totals; for they have both characteristics. Water and all 
<A NAME="918"></A>liquids and number are called totals, but 'the whole number' or 'the whole 
<A NAME="919"></A>water' one does not speak of, except by an extension of meaning. To things, 
<A NAME="920"></A>to which qua one the term 'total' is applied, the term 'all' is applied 
<A NAME="921"></A>when they are treated as separate; 'this total number,' 'all these 
<A NAME="922"></A>units.'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="923"></A><B>Part 27</B>
<A NAME="924"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="925"></A><BR><BR>"It is not any chance quantitative thing that can be said to be 
<A NAME="926"></A>'mutilated'; it must be a whole as well as divisible. For not only is two 
<A NAME="927"></A>not 'mutilated' if one of the two ones is taken away (for the part removed 
<A NAME="928"></A>by mutilation is never equal to the remainder), but in general no number 
<A NAME="929"></A>is thus mutilated; for it is also necessary that the essence remain; if 
<A NAME="930"></A>a cup is mutilated, it must still be a cup; but the number is no longer 
<A NAME="931"></A>the same. Further, even if things consist of unlike parts, not even these 
<A NAME="932"></A>things can all be said to be mutilated, for in a sense a number has unlike 
<A NAME="933"></A>parts (e.g. two and three) as well as like; but in general of the things 
<A NAME="934"></A>to which their position makes no difference, e.g. water or fire, none can 
<A NAME="935"></A>be mutilated; to be mutilated, things must be such as in virtue of their 
<A NAME="936"></A>essence have a certain position. Again, they must be continuous; for a 
<A NAME="937"></A>musical scale consists of unlike parts and has position, but cannot become 
<A NAME="938"></A>mutilated. Besides, not even the things that are wholes are mutilated by 
<A NAME="939"></A>the privation of any part. For the parts removed must be neither those 
<A NAME="940"></A>which determine the essence nor any chance parts, irrespective of their 
<A NAME="941"></A>position; e.g. a cup is not mutilated if it is bored through, but only 
<A NAME="942"></A>if the handle or a projecting part is removed, and a man is mutilated not 
<A NAME="943"></A>if the flesh or the spleen is removed, but if an extremity is, and that 
<A NAME="944"></A>not every extremity but one which when completely removed cannot grow again. 
<A NAME="945"></A>Therefore baldness is not a mutilation.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="946"></A><B>Part 28</B>
<A NAME="947"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="948"></A><BR><BR>"The term 'race' or 'genus' is used (1) if generation of things 
<A NAME="949"></A>which have the same form is continuous, e.g. 'while the race of men lasts' 
<A NAME="950"></A>means 'while the generation of them goes on continuously'.-(2) It is used 
<A NAME="951"></A>with reference to that which first brought things into existence; for it 
<A NAME="952"></A>is thus that some are called Hellenes by race and others Ionians, because 
<A NAME="953"></A>the former proceed from Hellen and the latter from Ion as their first begetter. 
<A NAME="954"></A>And the word is used in reference to the begetter more than to the matter, 
<A NAME="955"></A>though people also get a race-name from the female, e.g. 'the descendants 
<A NAME="956"></A>of Pyrrha'.-(3) There is genus in the sense in which 'plane' is the genus 
<A NAME="957"></A>of plane figures and solid' of solids; for each of the figures is in the 
<A NAME="958"></A>one case a plane of such and such a kind, and in the other a solid of such 
<A NAME="959"></A>and such a kind; and this is what underlies the differentiae. Again (4) 
<A NAME="960"></A>in definitions the first constituent element, which is included in the 
<A NAME="961"></A>'what', is the genus, whose differentiae the qualities are said to be 'Genus' 
<A NAME="962"></A>then is used in all these ways, (1) in reference to continuous generation 
<A NAME="963"></A>of the same kind, (2) in reference to the first mover which is of the same 
<A NAME="964"></A>kind as the things it moves, (3) as matter; for that to which the differentia 
<A NAME="965"></A>or quality belongs is the substratum, which we call matter. <BR><BR>"Those 
<A NAME="966"></A>things are said to be 'other in genus' whose proximate substratum is different, 
<A NAME="967"></A>and which are not analysed the one into the other nor both into the same 
<A NAME="968"></A>thing (e.g. form and matter are different in genus); and things which belong 
<A NAME="969"></A>to different categories of being (for some of the things that are said 
<A NAME="970"></A>to 'be' signify essence, others a quality, others the other categories 
<A NAME="971"></A>we have before distinguished); these also are not analysed either into 
<A NAME="972"></A>one another or into some one thing.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="973"></A><B>Part 29</B>
<A NAME="974"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="975"></A><BR><BR>"'The false' means (1) that which is false as a thing, and that 
<A NAME="976"></A>(a) because it is not put together or cannot be put together, e.g. 'that 
<A NAME="977"></A>the diagonal of a square is commensurate with the side' or 'that you are 
<A NAME="978"></A>sitting'; for one of these is false always, and the other sometimes; it 
<A NAME="979"></A>is in these two senses that they are non-existent. (b) There are things 
<A NAME="980"></A>which exist, but whose nature it is to appear either not to be such as 
<A NAME="981"></A>they are or to be things that do not exist, e.g. a sketch or a dream; for 
<A NAME="982"></A>these are something, but are not the things the appearance of which they 
<A NAME="983"></A>produce in us. We call things false in this way, then,-either because they 
<A NAME="984"></A>themselves do not exist, or because the appearance which results from them 
<A NAME="985"></A>is that of something that does not exist. <BR><BR>"(2) A false account 
<A NAME="986"></A>is the account of non-existent objects, in so far as it is false. Hence 
<A NAME="987"></A>every account is false when applied to something other than that of which 
<A NAME="988"></A>it is true; e.g. the account of a circle is false when applied to a triangle. 
<A NAME="989"></A>In a sense there is one account of each thing, i.e. the account of its 
<A NAME="990"></A>essence, but in a sense there are many, since the thing itself and the 
<A NAME="991"></A>thing itself with an attribute are in a sense the same, e.g. Socrates and 
<A NAME="992"></A>musical Socrates (a false account is not the account of anything, except 
<A NAME="993"></A>in a qualified sense). Hence Antisthenes was too simple-minded when he 
<A NAME="994"></A>claimed that nothing could be described except by the account proper to 
<A NAME="995"></A>it,-one predicate to one subject; from which the conclusion used to be 
<A NAME="996"></A>drawn that there could be no contradiction, and almost that there could 
<A NAME="997"></A>be no error. But it is possible to describe each thing not only by the 
<A NAME="998"></A>account of itself, but also by that of something else. This may be done 
<A NAME="999"></A>altogether falsely indeed, but there is also a way in which it may be done 
<A NAME="1000"></A>truly; e.g. eight may be described as a double number by the use of the 
<A NAME="1001"></A>definition of two. "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR><BR>"These things, then, are called false in these senses, but (3) 
<A NAME="1003"></A>a false man is one who is ready at and fond of such accounts, not for any 
<A NAME="1004"></A>other reason but for their own sake, and one who is good at impressing 
<A NAME="1005"></A>such accounts on other people, just as we say things are which produce 
<A NAME="1006"></A>a false appearance. This is why the proof in the Hippias that the same 
<A NAME="1007"></A>man is false and true is misleading. For it assumes that he is false who 
<A NAME="1008"></A>can deceive (i.e. the man who knows and is wise); and further that he who 
<A NAME="1009"></A>is willingly bad is better. This is a false result of induction-for a man 
<A NAME="1010"></A>who limps willingly is better than one who does so unwillingly-by 'limping' 
<A NAME="1011"></A>Plato means 'mimicking a limp', for if the man were lame willingly, he 
<A NAME="1012"></A>would presumably be worse in this case as in the corresponding case of 
<A NAME="1013"></A>moral character.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1014"></A><B>Part 30</B>
<A NAME="1015"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR><BR>"'Accident' means (1) that which attaches to something and can 
<A NAME="1017"></A>be truly asserted, but neither of necessity nor usually, e.g. if some one 
<A NAME="1018"></A>in digging a hole for a plant has found treasure. This-the finding of treasure-is 
<A NAME="1019"></A>for the man who dug the hole an accident; for neither does the one come 
<A NAME="1020"></A>of necessity from the other or after the other, nor, if a man plants, does 
<A NAME="1021"></A>he usually find treasure. And a musical man might be pale; but since this 
<A NAME="1022"></A>does not happen of necessity nor usually, we call it an accident. Therefore 
<A NAME="1023"></A>since there are attributes and they attach to subjects, and some of them 
<A NAME="1024"></A>attach to these only in a particular place and at a particular time, whatever 
<A NAME="1025"></A>attaches to a subject, but not because it was this subject, or the time 
<A NAME="1026"></A>this time, or the place this place, will be an accident. Therefore, too, 
<A NAME="1027"></A>there is no definite cause for an accident, but a chance cause, i.e. an 
<A NAME="1028"></A>indefinite one. Going to Aegina was an accident for a man, if he went not 
<A NAME="1029"></A>in order to get there, but because he was carried out of his way by a storm 
<A NAME="1030"></A>or captured by pirates. The accident has happened or exists,-not in virtue 
<A NAME="1031"></A>of the subject's nature, however, but of something else; for the storm 
<A NAME="1032"></A>was the cause of his coming to a place for which he was not sailing, and 
<A NAME="1033"></A>this was Aegina. <BR><BR>"'Accident' has also (2) another meaning, i.e. 
<A NAME="1034"></A>all that attaches to each thing in virtue of itself but is not in its essence, 
<A NAME="1035"></A>as having its angles equal to two right angles attaches to the triangle. 
<A NAME="1036"></A>And accidents of this sort may be eternal, but no accident of the other 
<A NAME="1037"></A>sort is. This is explained elsewhere.
