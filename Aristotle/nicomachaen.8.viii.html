<A NAME="10"></A>1
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>After what we have said, a discussion of friendship would naturally 
<A NAME="12"></A>follow, since it is a virtue or implies virtue, and is besides most necessary 
<A NAME="13"></A>with a view to living. For without friends no one would choose to live, 
<A NAME="14"></A>though he had all other goods; even rich men and those in possession of 
<A NAME="15"></A>office and of dominating power are thought to need friends most of all; 
<A NAME="16"></A>for what is the use of such prosperity without the opportunity of beneficence, 
<A NAME="17"></A>which is exercised chiefly and in its most laudable form towards friends? 
<A NAME="18"></A>Or how can prosperity be guarded and preserved without friends? The greater 
<A NAME="19"></A>it is, the more exposed is it to risk. And in poverty and in other misfortunes 
<A NAME="20"></A>men think friends are the only refuge. It helps the young, too, to keep 
<A NAME="21"></A>from error; it aids older people by ministering to their needs and supplementing 
<A NAME="22"></A>the activities that are failing from weakness; those in the prime of life 
<A NAME="23"></A>it stimulates to noble actions-'two going together'-for with friends men 
<A NAME="24"></A>are more able both to think and to act. Again, parent seems by nature to 
<A NAME="25"></A>feel it for offspring and offspring for parent, not only among men but 
<A NAME="26"></A>among birds and among most animals; it is felt mutually by members of the 
<A NAME="27"></A>same race, and especially by men, whence we praise lovers of their fellowmen. 
<A NAME="28"></A>We may even in our travels how near and dear every man is to every other. 
<A NAME="29"></A>Friendship seems too to hold states together, and lawgivers to care more 
<A NAME="30"></A>for it than for justice; for unanimity seems to be something like friendship, 
<A NAME="31"></A>and this they aim at most of all, and expel faction as their worst enemy; 
<A NAME="32"></A>and when men are friends they have no need of justice, while when they 
<A NAME="33"></A>are just they need friendship as well, and the truest form of justice is 
<A NAME="34"></A>thought to be a friendly quality.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>But it is not only necessary but also noble; for we praise those 
<A NAME="36"></A>who love their friends, and it is thought to be a fine thing to have many 
<A NAME="37"></A>friends; and again we think it is the same people that are good men and 
<A NAME="38"></A>are friends.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>Not a few things about friendship are matters of debate. Some define 
<A NAME="40"></A>it as a kind of likeness and say like people are friends, whence come the 
<A NAME="41"></A>sayings 'like to like', 'birds of a feather flock together', and so on; 
<A NAME="42"></A>others on the contrary say 'two of a trade never agree'. On this very question 
<A NAME="43"></A>they inquire for deeper and more physical causes, Euripides saying that 
<A NAME="44"></A>'parched earth loves the rain, and stately heaven when filled with rain 
<A NAME="45"></A>loves to fall to earth', and Heraclitus that 'it is what opposes that helps' 
<A NAME="46"></A>and 'from different tones comes the fairest tune' and 'all things are produced 
<A NAME="47"></A>through strife'; while Empedocles, as well as others, expresses the opposite 
<A NAME="48"></A>view that like aims at like. The physical problems we may leave alone (for 
<A NAME="49"></A>they do not belong to the present inquiry); let us examine those which 
<A NAME="50"></A>are human and involve character and feeling, e.g. whether friendship can 
<A NAME="51"></A>arise between any two people or people cannot be friends if they are wicked, 
<A NAME="52"></A>and whether there is one species of friendship or more than one. Those 
<A NAME="53"></A>who think there is only one because it admits of degrees have relied on 
<A NAME="54"></A>an inadequate indication; for even things different in species admit of 
<A NAME="55"></A>degree. We have discussed this matter previously.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>2
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>The kinds of friendship may perhaps be cleared up if we first come 
<A NAME="58"></A>to know the object of love. For not everything seems to be loved but only 
<A NAME="59"></A>the lovable, and this is good, pleasant, or useful; but it would seem to 
<A NAME="60"></A>be that by which some good or pleasure is produced that is useful, so that 
<A NAME="61"></A>it is the good and the useful that are lovable as ends. Do men love, then, 
<A NAME="62"></A>the good, or what is good for them? These sometimes clash. So too with 
<A NAME="63"></A>regard to the pleasant. Now it is thought that each loves what is good 
<A NAME="64"></A>for himself, and that the good is without qualification lovable, and what 
<A NAME="65"></A>is good for each man is lovable for him; but each man loves not what is 
<A NAME="66"></A>good for him but what seems good. This however will make no difference; 
<A NAME="67"></A>we shall just have to say that this is 'that which seems lovable'. Now 
<A NAME="68"></A>there are three grounds on which people love; of the love of lifeless objects 
<A NAME="69"></A>we do not use the word 'friendship'; for it is not mutual love, nor is 
<A NAME="70"></A>there a wishing of good to the other (for it would surely be ridiculous 
<A NAME="71"></A>to wish wine well; if one wishes anything for it, it is that it may keep, 
<A NAME="72"></A>so that one may have it oneself); but to a friend we say we ought to wish 
<A NAME="73"></A>what is good for his sake. But to those who thus wish good we ascribe only 
<A NAME="74"></A>goodwill, if the wish is not reciprocated; goodwill when it is reciprocal 
<A NAME="75"></A>being friendship. Or must we add 'when it is recognized'? For many people 
<A NAME="76"></A>have goodwill to those whom they have not seen but judge to be good or 
<A NAME="77"></A>useful; and one of these might return this feeling. These people seem to 
<A NAME="78"></A>bear goodwill to each other; but how could one call them friends when they 
<A NAME="79"></A>do not know their mutual feelings? To be friends, then, the must be mutually 
<A NAME="80"></A>recognized as bearing goodwill and wishing well to each other for one of 
<A NAME="81"></A>the aforesaid reasons.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>3
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>Now these reasons differ from each other in kind; so, therefore, 
<A NAME="84"></A>do the corresponding forms of love and friendship. There are therefore 
<A NAME="85"></A>three kinds of friendship, equal in number to the things that are lovable; 
<A NAME="86"></A>for with respect to each there is a mutual and recognized love, and those 
<A NAME="87"></A>who love each other wish well to each other in that respect in which they 
<A NAME="88"></A>love one another. Now those who love each other for their utility do not 
<A NAME="89"></A>love each other for themselves but in virtue of some good which they get 
<A NAME="90"></A>from each other. So too with those who love for the sake of pleasure; it 
<A NAME="91"></A>is not for their character that men love ready-witted people, but because 
<A NAME="92"></A>they find them pleasant. Therefore those who love for the sake of utility 
<A NAME="93"></A>love for the sake of what is good for themselves, and those who love for 
<A NAME="94"></A>the sake of pleasure do so for the sake of what is pleasant to themselves, 
<A NAME="95"></A>and not in so far as the other is the person loved but in so far as he 
<A NAME="96"></A>is useful or pleasant. And thus these friendships are only incidental; 
<A NAME="97"></A>for it is not as being the man he is that the loved person is loved, but 
<A NAME="98"></A>as providing some good or pleasure. Such friendships, then, are easily 
<A NAME="99"></A>dissolved, if the parties do not remain like themselves; for if the one 
<A NAME="100"></A>party is no longer pleasant or useful the other ceases to love 
<A NAME="101"></A>him.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>Now the useful is not permanent but is always changing. Thus when 
<A NAME="103"></A>the motive of the friendship is done away, the friendship is dissolved, 
<A NAME="104"></A>inasmuch as it existed only for the ends in question. This kind of friendship 
<A NAME="105"></A>seems to exist chiefly between old people (for at that age people pursue 
<A NAME="106"></A>not the pleasant but the useful) and, of those who are in their prime or 
<A NAME="107"></A>young, between those who pursue utility. And such people do not live much 
<A NAME="108"></A>with each other either; for sometimes they do not even find each other 
<A NAME="109"></A>pleasant; therefore they do not need such companionship unless they are 
<A NAME="110"></A>useful to each other; for they are pleasant to each other only in so far 
<A NAME="111"></A>as they rouse in each other hopes of something good to come. Among such 
<A NAME="112"></A>friendships people also class the friendship of a host and guest. On the 
<A NAME="113"></A>other hand the friendship of young people seems to aim at pleasure; for 
<A NAME="114"></A>they live under the guidance of emotion, and pursue above all what is pleasant 
<A NAME="115"></A>to themselves and what is immediately before them; but with increasing 
<A NAME="116"></A>age their pleasures become different. This is why they quickly become friends 
<A NAME="117"></A>and quickly cease to be so; their friendship changes with the object that 
<A NAME="118"></A>is found pleasant, and such pleasure alters quickly. Young people are amorous 
<A NAME="119"></A>too; for the greater part of the friendship of love depends on emotion 
<A NAME="120"></A>and aims at pleasure; this is why they fall in love and quickly fall out 
<A NAME="121"></A>of love, changing often within a single day. But these people do wish to 
<A NAME="122"></A>spend their days and lives together; for it is thus that they attain the 
<A NAME="123"></A>purpose of their friendship.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>Perfect friendship is the friendship of men who are good, and alike 
<A NAME="125"></A>in virtue; for these wish well alike to each other qua good, and they are 
<A NAME="126"></A>good themselves. Now those who wish well to their friends for their sake 
<A NAME="127"></A>are most truly friends; for they do this by reason of own nature and not 
<A NAME="128"></A>incidentally; therefore their friendship lasts as long as they are good-and 
<A NAME="129"></A>goodness is an enduring thing. And each is good without qualification and 
<A NAME="130"></A>to his friend, for the good are both good without qualification and useful 
<A NAME="131"></A>to each other. So too they are pleasant; for the good are pleasant both 
<A NAME="132"></A>without qualification and to each other, since to each his own activities 
<A NAME="133"></A>and others like them are pleasurable, and the actions of the good are the 
<A NAME="134"></A>same or like. And such a friendship is as might be expected permanent, 
<A NAME="135"></A>since there meet in it all the qualities that friends should have. For 
<A NAME="136"></A>all friendship is for the sake of good or of pleasure-good or pleasure 
<A NAME="137"></A>either in the abstract or such as will be enjoyed by him who has the friendly 
<A NAME="138"></A>feeling-and is based on a certain resemblance; and to a friendship of good 
<A NAME="139"></A>men all the qualities we have named belong in virtue of the nature of the 
<A NAME="140"></A>friends themselves; for in the case of this kind of friendship the other 
<A NAME="141"></A>qualities also are alike in both friends, and that which is good without 
<A NAME="142"></A>qualification is also without qualification pleasant, and these are the 
<A NAME="143"></A>most lovable qualities. Love and friendship therefore are found most and 
<A NAME="144"></A>in their best form between such men.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>But it is natural that such friendships should be infrequent; for 
<A NAME="146"></A>such men are rare. Further, such friendship requires time and familiarity; 
<A NAME="147"></A>as the proverb says, men cannot know each other till they have 'eaten salt 
<A NAME="148"></A>together'; nor can they admit each other to friendship or be friends till 
<A NAME="149"></A>each has been found lovable and been trusted by each. Those who quickly 
<A NAME="150"></A>show the marks of friendship to each other wish to be friends, but are 
<A NAME="151"></A>not friends unless they both are lovable and know the fact; for a wish 
<A NAME="152"></A>for friendship may arise quickly, but friendship does 
<A NAME="153"></A>not.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>4
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>This kind of friendship, then, is perfect both in respect of duration 
<A NAME="156"></A>and in all other respects, and in it each gets from each in all respects 
<A NAME="157"></A>the same as, or something like what, he gives; which is what ought to happen 
<A NAME="158"></A>between friends. Friendship for the sake of pleasure bears a resemblance 
<A NAME="159"></A>to this kind; for good people too are pleasant to each other. So too does 
<A NAME="160"></A>friendship for the sake of utility; for the good are also useful to each 
<A NAME="161"></A>other. Among men of these inferior sorts too, friendships are most permanent 
<A NAME="162"></A>when the friends get the same thing from each other (e.g. pleasure), and 
<A NAME="163"></A>not only that but also from the same source, as happens between readywitted 
<A NAME="164"></A>people, not as happens between lover and beloved. For these do not take 
<A NAME="165"></A>pleasure in the same things, but the one in seeing the beloved and the 
<A NAME="166"></A>other in receiving attentions from his lover; and when the bloom of youth 
<A NAME="167"></A>is passing the friendship sometimes passes too (for the one finds no pleasure 
<A NAME="168"></A>in the sight of the other, and the other gets no attentions from the first); 
<A NAME="169"></A>but many lovers on the other hand are constant, if familiarity has led 
<A NAME="170"></A>them to love each other's characters, these being alike. But those who 
<A NAME="171"></A>exchange not pleasure but utility in their amour are both less truly friends 
<A NAME="172"></A>and less constant. Those who are friends for the sake of utility part when 
<A NAME="173"></A>the advantage is at an end; for they were lovers not of each other but 
<A NAME="174"></A>of profit.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>For the sake of pleasure or utility, then, even bad men may be 
<A NAME="176"></A>friends of each other, or good men of bad, or one who is neither good nor 
<A NAME="177"></A>bad may be a friend to any sort of person, but for their own sake clearly 
<A NAME="178"></A>only good men can be friends; for bad men do not delight in each other 
<A NAME="179"></A>unless some advantage come of the relation.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>The friendship of the good too and this alone is proof against 
<A NAME="181"></A>slander; for it is not easy to trust any one talk about a man who has long 
<A NAME="182"></A>been tested by oneself; and it is among good men that trust and the feeling 
<A NAME="183"></A>that 'he would never wrong me' and all the other things that are demanded 
<A NAME="184"></A>in true friendship are found. In the other kinds of friendship, however, 
<A NAME="185"></A>there is nothing to prevent these evils arising. For men apply the name 
<A NAME="186"></A>of friends even to those whose motive is utility, in which sense states 
<A NAME="187"></A>are said to be friendly (for the alliances of states seem to aim at advantage), 
<A NAME="188"></A>and to those who love each other for the sake of pleasure, in which sense 
<A NAME="189"></A>children are called friends. Therefore we too ought perhaps to call such 
<A NAME="190"></A>people friends, and say that there are several kinds of friendship-firstly 
<A NAME="191"></A>and in the proper sense that of good men qua good, and by analogy the other 
<A NAME="192"></A>kinds; for it is in virtue of something good and something akin to what 
<A NAME="193"></A>is found in true friendship that they are friends, since even the pleasant 
<A NAME="194"></A>is good for the lovers of pleasure. But these two kinds of friendship are 
<A NAME="195"></A>not often united, nor do the same people become friends for the sake of 
<A NAME="196"></A>utility and of pleasure; for things that are only incidentally connected 
<A NAME="197"></A>are not often coupled together.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>Friendship being divided into these kinds, bad men will be friends 
<A NAME="199"></A>for the sake of pleasure or of utility, being in this respect like each 
<A NAME="200"></A>other, but good men will be friends for their own sake, i.e. in virtue 
<A NAME="201"></A>of their goodness. These, then, are friends without qualification; the 
<A NAME="202"></A>others are friends incidentally and through a resemblance to 
<A NAME="203"></A>these.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>5
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>As in regard to the virtues some men are called good in respect 
<A NAME="206"></A>of a state of character, others in respect of an activity, so too in the 
<A NAME="207"></A>case of friendship; for those who live together delight in each other and 
<A NAME="208"></A>confer benefits on each other, but those who are asleep or locally separated 
<A NAME="209"></A>are not performing, but are disposed to perform, the activities of friendship; 
<A NAME="210"></A>distance does not break off the friendship absolutely, but only the activity 
<A NAME="211"></A>of it. But if the absence is lasting, it seems actually to make men forget 
<A NAME="212"></A>their friendship; hence the saying 'out of sight, out of mind'. Neither 
<A NAME="213"></A>old people nor sour people seem to make friends easily; for there is little 
<A NAME="214"></A>that is pleasant in them, and no one can spend his days with one whose 
<A NAME="215"></A>company is painful, or not pleasant, since nature seems above all to avoid 
<A NAME="216"></A>the painful and to aim at the pleasant. Those, however, who approve of 
<A NAME="217"></A>each other but do not live together seem to be well-disposed rather than 
<A NAME="218"></A>actual friends. For there is nothing so characteristic of friends as living 
<A NAME="219"></A>together (since while it people who are in need that desire benefits, even 
<A NAME="220"></A>those who are supremely happy desire to spend their days together; for 
<A NAME="221"></A>solitude suits such people least of all); but people cannot live together 
<A NAME="222"></A>if they are not pleasant and do not enjoy the same things, as friends who 
<A NAME="223"></A>are companions seem to do.
<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>The truest friendship, then, is that of the good, as we have frequently 
<A NAME="225"></A>said; for that which is without qualification good or pleasant seems to 
<A NAME="226"></A>be lovable and desirable, and for each person that which is good or pleasant 
<A NAME="227"></A>to him; and the good man is lovable and desirable to the good man for both 
<A NAME="228"></A>these reasons. Now it looks as if love were a feeling, friendship a state 
<A NAME="229"></A>of character; for love may be felt just as much towards lifeless things, 
<A NAME="230"></A>but mutual love involves choice and choice springs from a state of character; 
<A NAME="231"></A>and men wish well to those whom they love, for their sake, not as a result 
<A NAME="232"></A>of feeling but as a result of a state of character. And in loving a friend 
<A NAME="233"></A>men love what is good for themselves; for the good man in becoming a friend 
<A NAME="234"></A>becomes a good to his friend. Each, then, both loves what is good for himself, 
<A NAME="235"></A>and makes an equal return in goodwill and in pleasantness; for friendship 
<A NAME="236"></A>is said to be equality, and both of these are found most in the friendship 
<A NAME="237"></A>of the good.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>6
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>Between sour and elderly people friendship arises less readily, 
<A NAME="240"></A>inasmuch as they are less good-tempered and enjoy companionship less; for 
<A NAME="241"></A>these are thou to be the greatest marks of friendship productive of it. 
<A NAME="242"></A>This is why, while men become friends quickly, old men do not; it is because 
<A NAME="243"></A>men do not become friends with those in whom they do not delight; and similarly 
<A NAME="244"></A>sour people do not quickly make friends either. But such men may bear goodwill 
<A NAME="245"></A>to each other; for they wish one another well and aid one another in need; 
<A NAME="246"></A>but they are hardly friends because they do not spend their days together 
<A NAME="247"></A>nor delight in each other, and these are thought the greatest marks of 
<A NAME="248"></A>friendship.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>One cannot be a friend to many people in the sense of having friendship 
<A NAME="250"></A>of the perfect type with them, just as one cannot be in love with many 
<A NAME="251"></A>people at once (for love is a sort of excess of feeling, and it is the 
<A NAME="252"></A>nature of such only to be felt towards one person); and it is not easy 
<A NAME="253"></A>for many people at the same time to please the same person very greatly, 
<A NAME="254"></A>or perhaps even to be good in his eyes. One must, too, acquire some experience 
<A NAME="255"></A>of the other person and become familiar with him, and that is very hard. 
<A NAME="256"></A>But with a view to utility or pleasure it is possible that many people 
<A NAME="257"></A>should please one; for many people are useful or pleasant, and these services 
<A NAME="258"></A>take little time.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>Of these two kinds that which is for the sake of pleasure is the 
<A NAME="260"></A>more like friendship, when both parties get the same things from each other 
<A NAME="261"></A>and delight in each other or in the things, as in the friendships of the 
<A NAME="262"></A>young; for generosity is more found in such friendships. Friendship based 
<A NAME="263"></A>on utility is for the commercially minded. People who are supremely happy, 
<A NAME="264"></A>too, have no need of useful friends, but do need pleasant friends; for 
<A NAME="265"></A>they wish to live with some one and, though they can endure for a short 
<A NAME="266"></A>time what is painful, no one could put up with it continuously, nor even 
<A NAME="267"></A>with the Good itself if it were painful to him; this is why they look out 
<A NAME="268"></A>for friends who are pleasant. Perhaps they should look out for friends 
<A NAME="269"></A>who, being pleasant, are also good, and good for them too; for so they 
<A NAME="270"></A>will have all the characteristics that friends should 
<A NAME="271"></A>have.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>People in positions of authority seem to have friends who fall 
<A NAME="273"></A>into distinct classes; some people are useful to them and others are pleasant, 
<A NAME="274"></A>but the same people are rarely both; for they seek neither those whose 
<A NAME="275"></A>pleasantness is accompanied by virtue nor those whose utility is with a 
<A NAME="276"></A>view to noble objects, but in their desire for pleasure they seek for ready-witted 
<A NAME="277"></A>people, and their other friends they choose as being clever at doing what 
<A NAME="278"></A>they are told, and these characteristics are rarely combined. Now we have 
<A NAME="279"></A>said that the good man is at the same time pleasant and useful; but such 
<A NAME="280"></A>a man does not become the friend of one who surpasses him in station, unless 
<A NAME="281"></A>he is surpassed also in virtue; if this is not so, he does not establish 
<A NAME="282"></A>equality by being proportionally exceeded in both respects. But people 
<A NAME="283"></A>who surpass him in both respects are not so easy to 
<A NAME="284"></A>find.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>However that may be, the aforesaid friendships involve equality; 
<A NAME="286"></A>for the friends get the same things from one another and wish the same 
<A NAME="287"></A>things for one another, or exchange one thing for another, e.g. pleasure 
<A NAME="288"></A>for utility; we have said, however, that they are both less truly friendships 
<A NAME="289"></A>and less permanent.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>But it is from their likeness and their unlikeness to the same 
<A NAME="291"></A>thing that they are thought both to be and not to be friendships. It is 
<A NAME="292"></A>by their likeness to the friendship of virtue that they seem to be friendships 
<A NAME="293"></A>(for one of them involves pleasure and the other utility, and these characteristics 
<A NAME="294"></A>belong to the friendship of virtue as well); while it is because the friendship 
<A NAME="295"></A>of virtue is proof against slander and permanent, while these quickly change 
<A NAME="296"></A>(besides differing from the former in many other respects), that they appear 
<A NAME="297"></A>not to be friendships; i.e. it is because of their unlikeness to the friendship 
<A NAME="298"></A>of virtue.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>7
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>But there is another kind of friendship, viz. that which involves 
<A NAME="301"></A>an inequality between the parties, e.g. that of father to son and in general 
<A NAME="302"></A>of elder to younger, that of man to wife and in general that of ruler to 
<A NAME="303"></A>subject. And these friendships differ also from each other; for it is not 
<A NAME="304"></A>the same that exists between parents and children and between rulers and 
<A NAME="305"></A>subjects, nor is even that of father to son the same as that of son to 
<A NAME="306"></A>father, nor that of husband to wife the same as that of wife to husband. 
<A NAME="307"></A>For the virtue and the function of each of these is different, and so are 
<A NAME="308"></A>the reasons for which they love; the love and the friendship are therefore 
<A NAME="309"></A>different also. Each party, then, neither gets the same from the other, 
<A NAME="310"></A>nor ought to seek it; but when children render to parents what they ought 
<A NAME="311"></A>to render to those who brought them into the world, and parents render 
<A NAME="312"></A>what they should to their children, the friendship of such persons will 
<A NAME="313"></A>be abiding and excellent. In all friendships implying inequality the love 
<A NAME="314"></A>also should be proportional, i.e. the better should be more loved than 
<A NAME="315"></A>he loves, and so should the more useful, and similarly in each of the other 
<A NAME="316"></A>cases; for when the love is in proportion to the merit of the parties, 
<A NAME="317"></A>then in a sense arises equality, which is certainly held to be characteristic 
<A NAME="318"></A>of friendship.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>But equality does not seem to take the same form in acts of justice 
<A NAME="320"></A>and in friendship; for in acts of justice what is equal in the primary 
<A NAME="321"></A>sense is that which is in proportion to merit, while quantitative equality 
<A NAME="322"></A>is secondary, but in friendship quantitative equality is primary and proportion 
<A NAME="323"></A>to merit secondary. This becomes clear if there is a great interval in 
<A NAME="324"></A>respect of virtue or vice or wealth or anything else between the parties; 
<A NAME="325"></A>for then they are no longer friends, and do not even expect to be so. And 
<A NAME="326"></A>this is most manifest in the case of the gods; for they surpass us most 
<A NAME="327"></A>decisively in all good things. But it is clear also in the case of kings; 
<A NAME="328"></A>for with them, too, men who are much their inferiors do not expect to be 
<A NAME="329"></A>friends; nor do men of no account expect to be friends with the best or 
<A NAME="330"></A>wisest men. In such cases it is not possible to define exactly up to what 
<A NAME="331"></A>point friends can remain friends; for much can be taken away and friendship 
<A NAME="332"></A>remain, but when one party is removed to a great distance, as God is, the 
<A NAME="333"></A>possibility of friendship ceases. This is in fact the origin of the question 
<A NAME="334"></A>whether friends really wish for their friends the greatest goods, e.g. 
<A NAME="335"></A>that of being gods; since in that case their friends will no longer be 
<A NAME="336"></A>friends to them, and therefore will not be good things for them (for friends 
<A NAME="337"></A>are good things). The answer is that if we were right in saying that friend 
<A NAME="338"></A>wishes good to friend for his sake, his friend must remain the sort of 
<A NAME="339"></A>being he is, whatever that may be; therefore it is for him oily so long 
<A NAME="340"></A>as he remains a man that he will wish the greatest goods. But perhaps not 
<A NAME="341"></A>all the greatest goods; for it is for himself most of all that each man 
<A NAME="342"></A>wishes what is good.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>8
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>Most people seem, owing to ambition, to wish to be loved rather 
<A NAME="345"></A>than to love; which is why most men love flattery; for the flatterer is 
<A NAME="346"></A>a friend in an inferior position, or pretends to be such and to love more 
<A NAME="347"></A>than he is loved; and being loved seems to be akin to being honoured, and 
<A NAME="348"></A>this is what most people aim at. But it seems to be not for its own sake 
<A NAME="349"></A>that people choose honour, but incidentally. For most people enjoy being 
<A NAME="350"></A>honoured by those in positions of authority because of their hopes (for 
<A NAME="351"></A>they think that if they want anything they will get it from them; and therefore 
<A NAME="352"></A>they delight in honour as a token of favour to come); while those who desire 
<A NAME="353"></A>honour from good men, and men who know, are aiming at confirming their 
<A NAME="354"></A>own opinion of themselves; they delight in honour, therefore, because they 
<A NAME="355"></A>believe in their own goodness on the strength of the judgement of those 
<A NAME="356"></A>who speak about them. In being loved, on the other hand, people delight 
<A NAME="357"></A>for its own sake; whence it would seem to be better than being honoured, 
<A NAME="358"></A>and friendship to be desirable in itself. But it seems to lie in loving 
<A NAME="359"></A>rather than in being loved, as is indicated by the delight mothers take 
<A NAME="360"></A>in loving; for some mothers hand over their children to be brought up, 
<A NAME="361"></A>and so long as they know their fate they love them and do not seek to be 
<A NAME="362"></A>loved in return (if they cannot have both), but seem to be satisfied if 
<A NAME="363"></A>they see them prospering; and they themselves love their children even 
<A NAME="364"></A>if these owing to their ignorance give them nothing of a mother's due. 
<A NAME="365"></A>Now since friendship depends more on loving, and it is those who love their 
<A NAME="366"></A>friends that are praised, loving seems to be the characteristic virtue 
<A NAME="367"></A>of friends, so that it is only those in whom this is found in due measure 
<A NAME="368"></A>that are lasting friends, and only their friendship that 
<A NAME="369"></A>endures.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>It is in this way more than any other that even unequals can be 
<A NAME="371"></A>friends; they can be equalized. Now equality and likeness are friendship, 
<A NAME="372"></A>and especially the likeness of those who are like in virtue; for being 
<A NAME="373"></A>steadfast in themselves they hold fast to each other, and neither ask nor 
<A NAME="374"></A>give base services, but (one may say) even prevent them; for it is characteristic 
<A NAME="375"></A>of good men neither to go wrong themselves nor to let their friends do 
<A NAME="376"></A>so. But wicked men have no steadfastness (for they do not remain even like 
<A NAME="377"></A>to themselves), but become friends for a short time because they delight 
<A NAME="378"></A>in each other's wickedness. Friends who are useful or pleasant last longer; 
<A NAME="379"></A>i.e. as long as they provide each other with enjoyments or advantages. 
<A NAME="380"></A>Friendship for utility's sake seems to be that which most easily exists 
<A NAME="381"></A>between contraries, e.g. between poor and rich, between ignorant and learned; 
<A NAME="382"></A>for what a man actually lacks he aims at, and one gives something else 
<A NAME="383"></A>in return. But under this head, too, might bring lover and beloved, beautiful 
<A NAME="384"></A>and ugly. This is why lovers sometimes seem ridiculous, when they demand 
<A NAME="385"></A>to be loved as they love; if they are equally lovable their claim can perhaps 
<A NAME="386"></A>be justified, but when they have nothing lovable about them it is ridiculous. 
<A NAME="387"></A>Perhaps, however, contrary does not even aim at contrary by its own nature, 
<A NAME="388"></A>but only incidentally, the desire being for what is intermediate; for that 
<A NAME="389"></A>is what is good, e.g. it is good for the dry not to become wet but to come 
<A NAME="390"></A>to the intermediate state, and similarly with the hot and in all other 
<A NAME="391"></A>cases. These subjects we may dismiss; for they are indeed somewhat foreign 
<A NAME="392"></A>to our inquiry.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>9
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>Friendship and justice seem, as we have said at the outset of our 
<A NAME="395"></A>discussion, to be concerned with the same objects and exhibited between 
<A NAME="396"></A>the same persons. For in every community there is thought to be some form 
<A NAME="397"></A>of justice, and friendship too; at least men address as friends their fellow-voyagers 
<A NAME="398"></A>and fellowsoldiers, and so too those associated with them in any other 
<A NAME="399"></A>kind of community. And the extent of their association is the extent of 
<A NAME="400"></A>their friendship, as it is the extent to which justice exists between them. 
<A NAME="401"></A>And the proverb 'what friends have is common property' expresses the truth; 
<A NAME="402"></A>for friendship depends on community. Now brothers and comrades have all 
<A NAME="403"></A>things in common, but the others to whom we have referred have definite 
<A NAME="404"></A>things in common-some more things, others fewer; for of friendships, too, 
<A NAME="405"></A>some are more and others less truly friendships. And the claims of justice 
<A NAME="406"></A>differ too; the duties of parents to children, and those of brothers to 
<A NAME="407"></A>each other are not the same, nor those of comrades and those of fellow-citizens, 
<A NAME="408"></A>and so, too, with the other kinds of friendship. There is a difference, 
<A NAME="409"></A>therefore, also between the acts that are unjust towards each of these 
<A NAME="410"></A>classes of associates, and the injustice increases by being exhibited towards 
<A NAME="411"></A>those who are friends in a fuller sense; e.g. it is a more terrible thing 
<A NAME="412"></A>to defraud a comrade than a fellow-citizen, more terrible not to help a 
<A NAME="413"></A>brother than a stranger, and more terrible to wound a father than any one 
<A NAME="414"></A>else. And the demands of justice also seem to increase with the intensity 
<A NAME="415"></A>of the friendship, which implies that friendship and justice exist between 
<A NAME="416"></A>the same persons and have an equal extension.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>Now all forms of community are like parts of the political community; 
<A NAME="418"></A>for men journey together with a view to some particular advantage, and 
<A NAME="419"></A>to provide something that they need for the purposes of life; and it is 
<A NAME="420"></A>for the sake of advantage that the political community too seems both to 
<A NAME="421"></A>have come together originally and to endure, for this is what legislators 
<A NAME="422"></A>aim at, and they call just that which is to the common advantage. Now the 
<A NAME="423"></A>other communities aim at advantage bit by bit, e.g. sailors at what is 
<A NAME="424"></A>advantageous on a voyage with a view to making money or something of the 
<A NAME="425"></A>kind, fellow-soldiers at what is advantageous in war, whether it is wealth 
<A NAME="426"></A>or victory or the taking of a city that they seek, and members of tribes 
<A NAME="427"></A>and demes act similarly (Some communities seem to arise for the sake or 
<A NAME="428"></A>pleasure, viz. religious guilds and social clubs; for these exist respectively 
<A NAME="429"></A>for the sake of offering sacrifice and of companionship. But all these 
<A NAME="430"></A>seem to fall under the political community; for it aims not at present 
<A NAME="431"></A>advantage but at what is advantageous for life as a whole), offering sacrifices 
<A NAME="432"></A>and arranging gatherings for the purpose, and assigning honours to the 
<A NAME="433"></A>gods, and providing pleasant relaxations for themselves. For the ancient 
<A NAME="434"></A>sacrifices and gatherings seem to take place after the harvest as a sort 
<A NAME="435"></A>of firstfruits, because it was at these seasons that people had most leisure. 
<A NAME="436"></A>All the communities, then, seem to be parts of the political community; 
<A NAME="437"></A>and the particular kinds friendship will correspond to the particular kinds 
<A NAME="438"></A>of community.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>10
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>There are three kinds of constitution, and an equal number of deviation-forms--perversions, 
<A NAME="441"></A>as it were, of them. The constitutions are monarchy, aristocracy, and thirdly 
<A NAME="442"></A>that which is based on a property qualification, which it seems appropriate 
<A NAME="443"></A>to call timocratic, though most people are wont to call it polity. The 
<A NAME="444"></A>best of these is monarchy, the worst timocracy. The deviation from monarchy 
<A NAME="445"></A>is tyrany; for both are forms of one-man rule, but there is the greatest 
<A NAME="446"></A>difference between them; the tyrant looks to his own advantage, the king 
<A NAME="447"></A>to that of his subjects. For a man is not a king unless he is sufficient 
<A NAME="448"></A>to himself and excels his subjects in all good things; and such a man needs 
<A NAME="449"></A>nothing further; therefore he will not look to his own interests but to 
<A NAME="450"></A>those of his subjects; for a king who is not like that would be a mere 
<A NAME="451"></A>titular king. Now tyranny is the very contrary of this; the tyrant pursues 
<A NAME="452"></A>his own good. And it is clearer in the case of tyranny that it is the worst 
<A NAME="453"></A>deviation-form; but it is the contrary of the best that is worst. Monarchy 
<A NAME="454"></A>passes over into tyranny; for tyranny is the evil form of one-man rule 
<A NAME="455"></A>and the bad king becomes a tyrant. Aristocracy passes over into oligarchy 
<A NAME="456"></A>by the badness of the rulers, who distribute contrary to equity what belongs 
<A NAME="457"></A>to the city-all or most of the good things to themselves, and office always 
<A NAME="458"></A>to the same people, paying most regard to wealth; thus the rulers are few 
<A NAME="459"></A>and are bad men instead of the most worthy. Timocracy passes over into 
<A NAME="460"></A>democracy; for these are coterminous, since it is the ideal even of timocracy 
<A NAME="461"></A>to be the rule of the majority, and all who have the property qualification 
<A NAME="462"></A>count as equal. Democracy is the least bad of the deviations; for in its 
<A NAME="463"></A>case the form of constitution is but a slight deviation. These then are 
<A NAME="464"></A>the changes to which constitutions are most subject; for these are the 
<A NAME="465"></A>smallest and easiest transitions.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR>One may find resemblances to the constitutions and, as it were, 
<A NAME="467"></A>patterns of them even in households. For the association of a father with 
<A NAME="468"></A>his sons bears the form of monarchy, since the father cares for his children; 
<A NAME="469"></A>and this is why Homer calls Zeus 'father'; it is the ideal of monarchy 
<A NAME="470"></A>to be paternal rule. But among the Persians the rule of the father is tyrannical; 
<A NAME="471"></A>they use their sons as slaves. Tyrannical too is the rule of a master over 
<A NAME="472"></A>slaves; for it is the advantage of the master that is brought about in 
<A NAME="473"></A>it. Now this seems to be a correct form of government, but the Persian 
<A NAME="474"></A>type is perverted; for the modes of rule appropriate to different relations 
<A NAME="475"></A>are diverse. The association of man and wife seems to be aristocratic; 
<A NAME="476"></A>for the man rules in accordance with his worth, and in those matters in 
<A NAME="477"></A>which a man should rule, but the matters that befit a woman he hands over 
<A NAME="478"></A>to her. If the man rules in everything the relation passes over into oligarchy; 
<A NAME="479"></A>for in doing so he is not acting in accordance with their respective worth, 
<A NAME="480"></A>and not ruling in virtue of his superiority. Sometimes, however, women 
<A NAME="481"></A>rule, because they are heiresses; so their rule is not in virtue of excellence 
<A NAME="482"></A>but due to wealth and power, as in oligarchies. The association of brothers 
<A NAME="483"></A>is like timocracy; for they are equal, except in so far as they differ 
<A NAME="484"></A>in age; hence if they differ much in age, the friendship is no longer of 
<A NAME="485"></A>the fraternal type. Democracy is found chiefly in masterless dwellings 
<A NAME="486"></A>(for here every one is on an equality), and in those in which the ruler 
<A NAME="487"></A>is weak and every one has licence to do as he pleases.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR>11
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR>Each of the constitutions may be seen to involve friendship just 
<A NAME="490"></A>in so far as it involves justice. The friendship between a king and his 
<A NAME="491"></A>subjects depends on an excess of benefits conferred; for he confers benefits 
<A NAME="492"></A>on his subjects if being a good man he cares for them with a view to their 
<A NAME="493"></A>well-being, as a shepherd does for his sheep (whence Homer called Agamemnon 
<A NAME="494"></A>'shepherd of the peoples'). Such too is the friendship of a father, though 
<A NAME="495"></A>this exceeds the other in the greatness of the benefits conferred; for 
<A NAME="496"></A>he is responsible for the existence of his children, which is thought the 
<A NAME="497"></A>greatest good, and for their nurture and upbringing.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><BR>These things are ascribed to ancestors as well. Further, by nature 
<A NAME="499"></A>a father tends to rule over his sons, ancestors over descendants, a king 
<A NAME="500"></A>over his subjects. These friendships imply superiority of one party over 
<A NAME="501"></A>the other, which is why ancestors are honoured. The justice therefore that 
<A NAME="502"></A>exists between persons so related is not the same on both sides but is 
<A NAME="503"></A>in every case proportioned to merit; for that is true of the friendship 
<A NAME="504"></A>as well. The friendship of man and wife, again, is the same that is found 
<A NAME="505"></A>in an aristocracy; for it is in accordance with virtue the better gets 
<A NAME="506"></A>more of what is good, and each gets what befits him; and so, too, with 
<A NAME="507"></A>the justice in these relations. The friendship of brothers is like that 
<A NAME="508"></A>of comrades; for they are equal and of like age, and such persons are for 
<A NAME="509"></A>the most part like in their feelings and their character. Like this, too, 
<A NAME="510"></A>is the friendship appropriate to timocratic government; for in such a constitution 
<A NAME="511"></A>the ideal is for the citizens to be equal and fair; therefore rule is taken 
<A NAME="512"></A>in turn, and on equal terms; and the friendship appropriate here will 
<A NAME="513"></A>correspond.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR>But in the deviation-forms, as justice hardly exists, so too does 
<A NAME="515"></A>friendship. It exists least in the worst form; in tyranny there is little 
<A NAME="516"></A>or no friendship. For where there is nothing common to ruler and ruled, 
<A NAME="517"></A>there is not friendship either, since there is not justice; e.g. between 
<A NAME="518"></A>craftsman and tool, soul and body, master and slave; the latter in each 
<A NAME="519"></A>case is benefited by that which uses it, but there is no friendship nor 
<A NAME="520"></A>justice towards lifeless things. But neither is there friendship towards 
<A NAME="521"></A>a horse or an ox, nor to a slave qua slave. For there is nothing common 
<A NAME="522"></A>to the two parties; the slave is a living tool and the tool a lifeless 
<A NAME="523"></A>slave. Qua slave then, one cannot be friends with him. But qua man one 
<A NAME="524"></A>can; for there seems to be some justice between any man and any other who 
<A NAME="525"></A>can share in a system of law or be a party to an agreement; therefore there 
<A NAME="526"></A>can also be friendship with him in so far as he is a man. Therefore while 
<A NAME="527"></A>in tyrannies friendship and justice hardly exist, in democracies they exist 
<A NAME="528"></A>more fully; for where the citizens are equal they have much in 
<A NAME="529"></A>common.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>12
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>Every form of friendship, then, involves association, as has been 
<A NAME="532"></A>said. One might, however, mark off from the rest both the friendship of 
<A NAME="533"></A>kindred and that of comrades. Those of fellow-citizens, fellow-tribesmen, 
<A NAME="534"></A>fellow-voyagers, and the like are more like mere friendships of association; 
<A NAME="535"></A>for they seem to rest on a sort of compact. With them we might class the 
<A NAME="536"></A>friendship of host and guest. The friendship of kinsmen itself, while it 
<A NAME="537"></A>seems to be of many kinds, appears to depend in every case on parental 
<A NAME="538"></A>friendship; for parents love their children as being a part of themselves, 
<A NAME="539"></A>and children their parents as being something originating from them. Now 
<A NAME="540"></A>(1) arents know their offspring better than there children know that they 
<A NAME="541"></A>are their children, and (2) the originator feels his offspring to be his 
<A NAME="542"></A>own more than the offspring do their begetter; for the product belongs 
<A NAME="543"></A>to the producer (e.g. a tooth or hair or anything else to him whose it 
<A NAME="544"></A>is), but the producer does not belong to the product, or belongs in a less 
<A NAME="545"></A>degree. And (3) the length of time produces the same result; parents love 
<A NAME="546"></A>their children as soon as these are born, but children love their parents 
<A NAME="547"></A>only after time has elapsed and they have acquired understanding or the 
<A NAME="548"></A>power of discrimination by the senses. From these considerations it is 
<A NAME="549"></A>also plain why mothers love more than fathers do. Parents, then, love their 
<A NAME="550"></A>children as themselves (for their issue are by virtue of their separate 
<A NAME="551"></A>existence a sort of other selves), while children love their parents as 
<A NAME="552"></A>being born of them, and brothers love each other as being born of the same 
<A NAME="553"></A>parents; for their identity with them makes them identical with each other 
<A NAME="554"></A>(which is the reason why people talk of 'the same blood', 'the same stock', 
<A NAME="555"></A>and so on). They are, therefore, in a sense the same thing, though in separate 
<A NAME="556"></A>individuals. Two things that contribute greatly to friendship are a common 
<A NAME="557"></A>upbringing and similarity of age; for 'two of an age take to each other', 
<A NAME="558"></A>and people brought up together tend to be comrades; whence the friendship 
<A NAME="559"></A>of brothers is akin to that of comrades. And cousins and other kinsmen 
<A NAME="560"></A>are bound up together by derivation from brothers, viz. by being derived 
<A NAME="561"></A>from the same parents. They come to be closer together or farther apart 
<A NAME="562"></A>by virtue of the nearness or distance of the original 
<A NAME="563"></A>ancestor.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>The friendship of children to parents, and of men to gods, is a 
<A NAME="565"></A>relation to them as to something good and superior; for they have conferred 
<A NAME="566"></A>the greatest benefits, since they are the causes of their being and of 
<A NAME="567"></A>their nourishment, and of their education from their birth; and this kind 
<A NAME="568"></A>of friendship possesses pleasantness and utility also, more than that of 
<A NAME="569"></A>strangers, inasmuch as their life is lived more in common. The friendship 
<A NAME="570"></A>of brothers has the characteristics found in that of comrades (and especially 
<A NAME="571"></A>when these are good), and in general between people who are like each other, 
<A NAME="572"></A>inasmuch as they belong more to each other and start with a love for each 
<A NAME="573"></A>other from their very birth, and inasmuch as those born of the same parents 
<A NAME="574"></A>and brought up together and similarly educated are more akin in character; 
<A NAME="575"></A>and the test of time has been applied most fully and convincingly in their 
<A NAME="576"></A>case.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR>Between other kinsmen friendly relations are found in due proportion. 
<A NAME="578"></A>Between man and wife friendship seems to exist by nature; for man is naturally 
<A NAME="579"></A>inclined to form couples-even more than to form cities, inasmuch as the 
<A NAME="580"></A>household is earlier and more necessary than the city, and reproduction 
<A NAME="581"></A>is more common to man with the animals. With the other animals the union 
<A NAME="582"></A>extends only to this point, but human beings live together not only for 
<A NAME="583"></A>the sake of reproduction but also for the various purposes of life; for 
<A NAME="584"></A>from the start the functions are divided, and those of man and woman are 
<A NAME="585"></A>different; so they help each other by throwing their peculiar gifts into 
<A NAME="586"></A>the common stock. It is for these reasons that both utility and pleasure 
<A NAME="587"></A>seem to be found in this kind of friendship. But this friendship may be 
<A NAME="588"></A>based also on virtue, if the parties are good; for each has its own virtue 
<A NAME="589"></A>and they will delight in the fact. And children seem to be a bond of union 
<A NAME="590"></A>(which is the reason why childless people part more easily); for children 
<A NAME="591"></A>are a good common to both and what is common holds them 
<A NAME="592"></A>together.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR>How man and wife and in general friend and friend ought mutually 
<A NAME="594"></A>to behave seems to be the same question as how it is just for them to behave; 
<A NAME="595"></A>for a man does not seem to have the same duties to a friend, a stranger, 
<A NAME="596"></A>a comrade, and a schoolfellow.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>13
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>There are three kinds of friendship, as we said at the outset of 
<A NAME="599"></A>our inquiry, and in respect of each some are friends on an equality and 
<A NAME="600"></A>others by virtue of a superiority (for not only can equally good men become 
<A NAME="601"></A>friends but a better man can make friends with a worse, and similarly in 
<A NAME="602"></A>friendships of pleasure or utility the friends may be equal or unequal 
<A NAME="603"></A>in the benefits they confer). This being so, equals must effect the required 
<A NAME="604"></A>equalization on a basis of equality in love and in all other respects, 
<A NAME="605"></A>while unequals must render what is in proportion to their superiority or 
<A NAME="606"></A>inferiority. Complaints and reproaches arise either only or chiefly in 
<A NAME="607"></A>the friendship of utility, and this is only to be expected. For those who 
<A NAME="608"></A>are friends on the ground of virtue are anxious to do well by each other 
<A NAME="609"></A>(since that is a mark of virtue and of friendship), and between men who 
<A NAME="610"></A>are emulating each other in this there cannot be complaints or quarrels; 
<A NAME="611"></A>no one is offended by a man who loves him and does well by him-if he is 
<A NAME="612"></A>a person of nice feeling he takes his revenge by doing well by the other. 
<A NAME="613"></A>And the man who excels the other in the services he renders will not complain 
<A NAME="614"></A>of his friend, since he gets what he aims at; for each man desires what 
<A NAME="615"></A>is good. Nor do complaints arise much even in friendships of pleasure; 
<A NAME="616"></A>for both get at the same time what they desire, if they enjoy spending 
<A NAME="617"></A>their time together; and even a man who complained of another for not affording 
<A NAME="618"></A>him pleasure would seem ridiculous, since it is in his power not to spend 
<A NAME="619"></A>his days with him.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>But the friendship of utility is full of complaints; for as they 
<A NAME="621"></A>use each other for their own interests they always want to get the better 
<A NAME="622"></A>of the bargain, and think they have got less than they should, and blame 
<A NAME="623"></A>their partners because they do not get all they 'want and deserve'; and 
<A NAME="624"></A>those who do well by others cannot help them as much as those whom they 
<A NAME="625"></A>benefit want.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>Now it seems that, as justice is of two kinds, one unwritten and 
<A NAME="627"></A>the other legal, one kind of friendship of utility is moral and the other 
<A NAME="628"></A>legal. And so complaints arise most of all when men do not dissolve the 
<A NAME="629"></A>relation in the spirit of the same type of friendship in which they contracted 
<A NAME="630"></A>it. The legal type is that which is on fixed terms; its purely commercial 
<A NAME="631"></A>variety is on the basis of immediate payment, while the more liberal variety 
<A NAME="632"></A>allows time but stipulates for a definite quid pro quo. In this variety 
<A NAME="633"></A>the debt is clear and not ambiguous, but in the postponement it contains 
<A NAME="634"></A>an element of friendliness; and so some states do not allow suits arising 
<A NAME="635"></A>out of such agreements, but think men who have bargained on a basis of 
<A NAME="636"></A>credit ought to accept the consequences. The moral type is not on fixed 
<A NAME="637"></A>terms; it makes a gift, or does whatever it does, as to a friend; but one 
<A NAME="638"></A>expects to receive as much or more, as having not given but lent; and if 
<A NAME="639"></A>a man is worse off when the relation is dissolved than he was when it was 
<A NAME="640"></A>contracted he will complain. This happens because all or most men, while 
<A NAME="641"></A>they wish for what is noble, choose what is advantageous; now it is noble 
<A NAME="642"></A>to do well by another without a view to repayment, but it is the receiving 
<A NAME="643"></A>of benefits that is advantageous. Therefore if we can we should return 
<A NAME="644"></A>the equivalent of what we have received (for we must not make a man our 
<A NAME="645"></A>friend against his will; we must recognize that we were mistaken at the 
<A NAME="646"></A>first and took a benefit from a person we should not have taken it from-since 
<A NAME="647"></A>it was not from a friend, nor from one who did it just for the sake of 
<A NAME="648"></A>acting so-and we must settle up just as if we had been benefited on fixed 
<A NAME="649"></A>terms). Indeed, one would agree to repay if one could (if one could not, 
<A NAME="650"></A>even the giver would not have expected one to do so); therefore if it is 
<A NAME="651"></A>possible we must repay. But at the outset we must consider the man by whom 
<A NAME="652"></A>we are being benefited and on what terms he is acting, in order that we 
<A NAME="653"></A>may accept the benefit on these terms, or else decline 
<A NAME="654"></A>it.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>It is disputable whether we ought to measure a service by its utility 
<A NAME="656"></A>to the receiver and make the return with a view to that, or by the benevolence 
<A NAME="657"></A>of the giver. For those who have received say they have received from their 
<A NAME="658"></A>benefactors what meant little to the latter and what they might have got 
<A NAME="659"></A>from others-minimizing the service; while the givers, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="660"></A>say it was the biggest thing they had, and what could not have been got 
<A NAME="661"></A>from others, and that it was given in times of danger or similar need. 
<A NAME="662"></A>Now if the friendship is one that aims at utility, surely the advantage 
<A NAME="663"></A>to the receiver is the measure. For it is he that asks for the service, 
<A NAME="664"></A>and the other man helps him on the assumption that he will receive the 
<A NAME="665"></A>equivalent; so the assistance has been precisely as great as the advantage 
<A NAME="666"></A>to the receiver, and therefore he must return as much as he has received, 
<A NAME="667"></A>or even more (for that would be nobler). In friendships based on virtue 
<A NAME="668"></A>on the other hand, complaints do not arise, but the purpose of the doer 
<A NAME="669"></A>is a sort of measure; for in purpose lies the essential element of virtue 
<A NAME="670"></A>and character.
<A NAME="671"></A><BR><BR>14
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>Differences arise also in friendships based on superiority; for 
<A NAME="673"></A>each expects to get more out of them, but when this happens the friendship 
<A NAME="674"></A>is dissolved. Not only does the better man think he ought to get more, 
<A NAME="675"></A>since more should be assigned to a good man, but the more useful similarly 
<A NAME="676"></A>expects this; they say a useless man should not get as much as they should, 
<A NAME="677"></A>since it becomes an act of public service and not a friendship if the proceeds 
<A NAME="678"></A>of the friendship do not answer to the worth of the benefits conferred. 
<A NAME="679"></A>For they think that, as in a commercial partnership those who put more 
<A NAME="680"></A>in get more out, so it should be in friendship. But the man who is in a 
<A NAME="681"></A>state of need and inferiority makes the opposite claim; they think it is 
<A NAME="682"></A>the part of a good friend to help those who are in need; what, they say, 
<A NAME="683"></A>is the use of being the friend of a good man or a powerful man, if one 
<A NAME="684"></A>is to get nothing out of it?
<A NAME="685"></A><BR><BR>At all events it seems that each party is justified in his claim, 
<A NAME="686"></A>and that each should get more out of the friendship than the other-not 
<A NAME="687"></A>more of the same thing, however, but the superior more honour and the inferior 
<A NAME="688"></A>more gain; for honour is the prize of virtue and of beneficence, while 
<A NAME="689"></A>gain is the assistance required by inferiority.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>It seems to be so in constitutional arrangements also; the man 
<A NAME="691"></A>who contributes nothing good to the common stock is not honoured; for what 
<A NAME="692"></A>belongs to the public is given to the man who benefits the public, and 
<A NAME="693"></A>honour does belong to the public. It is not possible to get wealth from 
<A NAME="694"></A>the common stock and at the same time honour. For no one puts up with the 
<A NAME="695"></A>smaller share in all things; therefore to the man who loses in wealth they 
<A NAME="696"></A>assign honour and to the man who is willing to be paid, wealth, since the 
<A NAME="697"></A>proportion to merit equalizes the parties and preserves the friendship, 
<A NAME="698"></A>as we have said. This then is also the way in which we should associate 
<A NAME="699"></A>with unequals; the man who is benefited in respect of wealth or virtue 
<A NAME="700"></A>must give honour in return, repaying what he can. For friendship asks a 
<A NAME="701"></A>man to do what he can, not what is proportional to the merits of the case; 
<A NAME="702"></A>since that cannot always be done, e.g. in honours paid to the gods or to 
<A NAME="703"></A>parents; for no one could ever return to them the equivalent of what he 
<A NAME="704"></A>gets, but the man who serves them to the utmost of his power is thought 
<A NAME="705"></A>to be a good man. This is why it would not seem open to a man to disown 
<A NAME="706"></A>his father (though a father may disown his son); being in debt, he should 
<A NAME="707"></A>repay, but there is nothing by doing which a son will have done the equivalent 
<A NAME="708"></A>of what he has received, so that he is always in debt. But creditors can 
<A NAME="709"></A>remit a debt; and a father can therefore do so too. At the same time it 
<A NAME="710"></A>is thought that presumably no one would repudiate a son who was not far 
<A NAME="711"></A>gone in wickedness; for apart from the natural friendship of father and 
<A NAME="712"></A>son it is human nature not to reject a son's assistance. But the son, if 
<A NAME="713"></A>he is wicked, will naturally avoid aiding his father, or not be zealous 
<A NAME="714"></A>about it; for most people wish to get benefits, but avoid doing them, as 
<A NAME="715"></A>a thing unprofitable.-So much for these questions.
