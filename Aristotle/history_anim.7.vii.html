<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>As to Man's growth, first within his mother's womb and afterward to old 
<A NAME="12"></A>age, the course of nature, in so far as man is specially concerned, is 
<A NAME="13"></A>after the following manner. And, by the way, the difference of male and 
<A NAME="14"></A>female and of their respective organs has been dealt with heretofore. When 
<A NAME="15"></A>twice seven years old, in the most of cases, the male begins to engender 
<A NAME="16"></A>seed; and at the same time hair appears upon the pubes, in like manner, 
<A NAME="17"></A>so Alcmaeon of Croton remarks, as plants first blossom and then seed. About 
<A NAME="18"></A>the same time, the voice begins to alter, getting harsher and more uneven, 
<A NAME="19"></A>neither shrill as formerly nor deep as afterward, nor yet of any even tone, 
<A NAME="20"></A>but like an instrument whose strings are frayed and out of tune; and it 
<A NAME="21"></A>is called, by way of by-word, the bleat of the billy-goat. Now this breaking 
<A NAME="22"></A>of the voice is the more apparent in those who are making trial of their 
<A NAME="23"></A>sexual powers; for in those who are prone to lustfulness the voice turns 
<A NAME="24"></A>into the voice of a man, but not so in the continent. For if a lad strive 
<A NAME="25"></A>diligently to hinder his voice from breaking, as some do of those who devote 
<A NAME="26"></A>themselves to music, the voice lasts a long while unbroken and may even 
<A NAME="27"></A>persist with little change. And the breasts swell and likewise the private 
<A NAME="28"></A>parts, altering in size and shape. (And by the way, at this time of life 
<A NAME="29"></A>those who try by friction to provoke emission of seed are apt to experience 
<A NAME="30"></A>pain as well as voluptuous sensations.) At the same age in the female, 
<A NAME="31"></A>the breasts swell and the so-called catamenia commence to flow; and this 
<A NAME="32"></A>fluid resembles fresh blood. There is another discharge, a white one, by 
<A NAME="33"></A>the way, which occurs in girls even at a very early age, more especially 
<A NAME="34"></A>if their diet be largely of a fluid nature; and this malady causes arrest 
<A NAME="35"></A>of growth and loss of flesh. In the majority of cases the catamenia are 
<A NAME="36"></A>noticed by the time the breasts have grown to the height of two fingers' 
<A NAME="37"></A>breadth. In girls, too, about this time the voice changes to a deeper note; 
<A NAME="38"></A>for while in general the woman's voice is higher than the man's, so also 
<A NAME="39"></A>the voices of girls are pitched in a higher key than the elder women's, 
<A NAME="40"></A>just as the boy's are higher than the men's; and the girls' voices are 
<A NAME="41"></A>shriller than the boys', and a maid's flute is tuned sharper than a 
<A NAME="42"></A>lad's.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>Girls of this age have much need of surveillance. For then in particular 
<A NAME="44"></A>they feel a natural impulse to make usage of the sexual faculties that 
<A NAME="45"></A>are developing in them; so that unless they guard against any further impulse 
<A NAME="46"></A>beyond that inevitable one which their bodily development of itself supplies, 
<A NAME="47"></A>even in the case of those who abstain altogether from passionate indulgence, 
<A NAME="48"></A>they contract habits which are apt to continue into later life. For girls 
<A NAME="49"></A>who give way to wantonness grow more and more wanton; and the same is true 
<A NAME="50"></A>of boys, unless they be safeguarded from one temptation and another; for 
<A NAME="51"></A>the passages become dilated and set up a local flux or running, and besides 
<A NAME="52"></A>this the recollection of pleasure associated with former indulgence creates 
<A NAME="53"></A>a longing for its repetition.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>Some men are congenitally impotent owing to structural defect; 
<A NAME="55"></A>and in like manner women also may suffer from congenital incapacity. Both 
<A NAME="56"></A>men and women are liable to constitutional change, growing healthier or 
<A NAME="57"></A>more sickly, or altering in the way of leanness, stoutness, and vigour; 
<A NAME="58"></A>thus, after puberty some lads who were thin before grow stout and healthy, 
<A NAME="59"></A>and the converse also happens; and the same is equally true of girls. For 
<A NAME="60"></A>when in boy or girl the body is loaded with superfluous matter, then, when 
<A NAME="61"></A>such superfluities are got rid of in the spermatic or catamenial discharge, 
<A NAME="62"></A>their bodies improve in health and condition owing to the removal of what 
<A NAME="63"></A>had acted as an impediment to health and proper nutrition; but in such 
<A NAME="64"></A>as are of opposite habit their bodies become emaciated and out of health, 
<A NAME="65"></A>for then the spermatic discharge in the one case and the catamenial flow 
<A NAME="66"></A>in the other take place at the cost of natural healthy 
<A NAME="67"></A>conditions.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore, in the case of maidens the condition of the breasts 
<A NAME="69"></A>is diverse in different individuals, for they are sometimes quite big and 
<A NAME="70"></A>sometimes little; and as a general rule their size depends on whether or 
<A NAME="71"></A>not the body was burthened in childhood with superfluous material. For 
<A NAME="72"></A>when the signs of womanhood are nigh but not come, the more there be of 
<A NAME="73"></A>moisture the more will it cause the breasts to swell, even to the bursting 
<A NAME="74"></A>point; and the result is that the breasts remain during after-life of the 
<A NAME="75"></A>bulk that they then acquired. And among men, the breasts grow more conspicuous 
<A NAME="76"></A>and more like to those of women, both in young men and old, when the individual 
<A NAME="77"></A>temperament is moist and sleek and the reverse of sinewy, and all the more 
<A NAME="78"></A>among the dark-complexioned than the fair.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>At the outset and till the age of one and twenty the spermatic 
<A NAME="80"></A>discharge is devoid of fecundity; afterwards it becomes fertile, but young 
<A NAME="81"></A>men and women produce undersized and imperfect progeny, as is the case 
<A NAME="82"></A>also with the common run of animals. Young women conceive readily, but, 
<A NAME="83"></A>having conceived, their labour in childbed is apt to be 
<A NAME="84"></A>difficult.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>The frame fails of reaching its full development and ages quickly 
<A NAME="86"></A>in men of intemperate lusts and in women who become mothers of many children; 
<A NAME="87"></A>for it appears to be the case that growth ceases when the woman has given 
<A NAME="88"></A>birth to three children. Women of a lascivious disposition grow more sedate 
<A NAME="89"></A>and virtuous after they have borne several children.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>After the age of twenty-one women are fully ripe for child-bearing, 
<A NAME="91"></A>but men go on increasing in vigour. When the spermatic fluid is of a thin 
<A NAME="92"></A>consistency it is infertile; when granular it is fertile and likely to 
<A NAME="93"></A>produce male children, but when thin and unclotted it is apt to produce 
<A NAME="94"></A>female offspring. And it is about this time of life that in men the beard 
<A NAME="95"></A>makes its appearance.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="96"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>The onset of the catamenia in women takes place towards the end 
<A NAME="98"></A>of the month; and on this account the wiseacres assert that the moon is 
<A NAME="99"></A>feminine, because the discharge in women and the waning of the moon happen 
<A NAME="100"></A>at one and the same time, and after the wane and the discharge both one 
<A NAME="101"></A>and the other grow whole again. (In some women the catamenia occur regularly 
<A NAME="102"></A>but sparsely every month, and more abundantly every third month.) With 
<A NAME="103"></A>those in whom the ailment lasts but a little while, two days or three, 
<A NAME="104"></A>recovery is easy; but where the duration is longer, the ailment is more 
<A NAME="105"></A>troublesome. For women are ailing during these days; and sometimes the 
<A NAME="106"></A>discharge is sudden and sometimes gradual, but in all cases alike there 
<A NAME="107"></A>is bodily distress until the attack be over. In many cases at the commencement 
<A NAME="108"></A>of the attack, when the discharge is about to appear, there occur spasms 
<A NAME="109"></A>and rumbling noises within the womb until such time as the discharge manifests 
<A NAME="110"></A>itself.
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>Under natural conditions it is after recovery from these symptoms 
<A NAME="112"></A>that conception takes place in women, and women in whom the signs do not 
<A NAME="113"></A>manifest themselves for the most part remain childless. But the rule is 
<A NAME="114"></A>not without exception, for some conceive in spite of the absence of these 
<A NAME="115"></A>symptoms; and these are cases in which a secretion accumulates, not in 
<A NAME="116"></A>such a way as actually to issue forth, but in amount equal to the residuum 
<A NAME="117"></A>left in the case of child-bearing women after the normal discharge has 
<A NAME="118"></A>taken place. And some conceive while the signs are on but not afterwards, 
<A NAME="119"></A>those namely in whom the womb closes up immediately after the discharge. 
<A NAME="120"></A>In some cases the menses persist during pregnancy up to the very last; 
<A NAME="121"></A>but the result in these cases is that the offspring are poor, and either 
<A NAME="122"></A>fail to survive or grow up weakly.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>In many cases, owing to excessive desire, arising either from youthful 
<A NAME="124"></A>impetuosity or from lengthened abstinence, prolapsion of the womb takes 
<A NAME="125"></A>place and the catamenia appear repeatedly, thrice in the month, until conception 
<A NAME="126"></A>occurs; and then the womb withdraws upwards again to its proper 
<A NAME="127"></A>place...
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>As we have remarked above, the discharge is wont to be more abundant 
<A NAME="129"></A>in women than in the females of any other animals. In creatures that do 
<A NAME="130"></A>not bring forth their young alive nothing of the sort manifests itself, 
<A NAME="131"></A>this particular superfluity being converted into bodily substance; and 
<A NAME="132"></A>by the way, in such animals the females are sometimes larger than the males; 
<A NAME="133"></A>and moreover, the material is used up sometimes for scutes and sometimes 
<A NAME="134"></A>for scales, and sometimes for the abundant covering of feathers, whereas 
<A NAME="135"></A>in the vivipara possessed of limbs it is turned into hair and into bodily 
<A NAME="136"></A>substance (for man alone among them is smooth-skinned), and into urine, 
<A NAME="137"></A>for this excretion is in the majority of such animals thick and copious. 
<A NAME="138"></A>Only in the case of women is the superfluity turned into a discharge instead 
<A NAME="139"></A>of being utilized in these other ways.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>There is something similar to be remarked of men: for in proportion 
<A NAME="141"></A>to his size man emits more seminal fluid than any other animal (for which 
<A NAME="142"></A>reason man is the smoothest of animals), especially such men as are of 
<A NAME="143"></A>a moist habit and not over corpulent, and fair men in greater degree than 
<A NAME="144"></A>dark. It is likewise with women; for in the stout, great part of the excretion 
<A NAME="145"></A>goes to nourish the body. In the act of intercourse, women of a fair complexion 
<A NAME="146"></A>discharge a more plentiful secretion than the dark; and furthermore, a 
<A NAME="147"></A>watery and pungent diet conduces to this phenomenon.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="148"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>It is a sign of conception in women when the place is dry immediately 
<A NAME="150"></A>after intercourse. If the lips of the orifice be smooth conception is difficult, 
<A NAME="151"></A>for the matter slips off; and if they be thick it is also difficult. But 
<A NAME="152"></A>if on digital examination the lips feel somewhat rough and adherent, and 
<A NAME="153"></A>if they be likewise thin, then the chances are in favour of conception. 
<A NAME="154"></A>Accordingly, if conception be desired, we must bring the parts into such 
<A NAME="155"></A>a condition as we have just described; but if on the contrary we want to 
<A NAME="156"></A>avoid conception then we must bring about a contrary disposition. Wherefore, 
<A NAME="157"></A>since if the parts be smooth conception is prevented, some anoint that 
<A NAME="158"></A>part of the womb on which the seed falls with oil of cedar, or with ointment 
<A NAME="159"></A>of lead or with frankincense, commingled with olive oil. If the seed remain 
<A NAME="160"></A>within for seven days then it is certain that conception has taken place; 
<A NAME="161"></A>for it is during that period that what is known as effluxion takes 
<A NAME="162"></A>place.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>In most cases the menstrual discharge recurs for some time after 
<A NAME="164"></A>conception has taken place, its duration being mostly thirty days in the 
<A NAME="165"></A>case of a female and about forty days in the case of a male child. After 
<A NAME="166"></A>parturition also it is common for the discharge to be withheld for an equal 
<A NAME="167"></A>number of days, but not in all cases with equal exactitude. After conception, 
<A NAME="168"></A>and when the above-mentioned days are past, the discharge no longer takes 
<A NAME="169"></A>its natural course but finds its way to the breasts and turns to milk. 
<A NAME="170"></A>The first appearance of milk in the breasts is scant in quantity and so 
<A NAME="171"></A>to speak cobwebby or interspersed with little threads. And when conception 
<A NAME="172"></A>has taken place, there is apt to be a sort of feeling in the region of 
<A NAME="173"></A>the flanks, which in some cases quickly swell up a little, especially in 
<A NAME="174"></A>thin persons, and also in the groin.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>In the case of male children the first movement usually occurs 
<A NAME="176"></A>on the right-hand side of the womb and about the fortieth day, but if the 
<A NAME="177"></A>child be a female then on the left-hand side and about the ninetieth day. 
<A NAME="178"></A>However, we must by no means assume this to be an accurate statement of 
<A NAME="179"></A>fact, for there are many exceptions, in which the movement is manifested 
<A NAME="180"></A>on the right-hand side though a female child be coming, and on the left-hand 
<A NAME="181"></A>side though the infant be a male. And in short, these and all suchlike 
<A NAME="182"></A>phenomena are usually subject to differences that may be summed up as differences 
<A NAME="183"></A>of degree.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>About this period the embryo begins to resolve into distinct parts, 
<A NAME="185"></A>it having hitherto consisted of a fleshlike substance without distinction 
<A NAME="186"></A>of parts.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>What is called effluxion is a destruction of the embryo within 
<A NAME="188"></A>the first week, while abortion occurs up to the fortieth day; and the greater 
<A NAME="189"></A>number of such embryos as perish do so within the space of these forty 
<A NAME="190"></A>days.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>In the case of a male embryo aborted at the fortieth day, if it 
<A NAME="192"></A>be placed in cold water it holds together in a sort of membrane, but if 
<A NAME="193"></A>it be placed in any other fluid it dissolves and disappears. If the membrane 
<A NAME="194"></A>be pulled to bits the embryo is revealed, as big as one of the large kind 
<A NAME="195"></A>of ants; and all the limbs are plain to see, including the penis, and the 
<A NAME="196"></A>eyes also, which as in other animals are of great size. But the female 
<A NAME="197"></A>embryo, if it suffer abortion during the first three months, is as a rule 
<A NAME="198"></A>found to be undifferentiated; if however it reach the fourth month it comes 
<A NAME="199"></A>to be subdivided and quickly attains further differentiation. In short, 
<A NAME="200"></A>while within the womb, the female infant accomplishes the whole development 
<A NAME="201"></A>of its parts more slowly than the male, and more frequently than the man-child 
<A NAME="202"></A>takes ten months to come to perfection. But after birth, the females pass 
<A NAME="203"></A>more quickly than the males through youth and maturity and age; and this 
<A NAME="204"></A>is especially true of those that bear many children, as indeed I have already 
<A NAME="205"></A>said.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="206"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>When the womb has conceived the seed, straightway in the majority 
<A NAME="208"></A>of cases it closes up until seven months are fulfilled; but in the eighth 
<A NAME="209"></A>month it opens, and the embryo, if it be fertile, descends in the eighth 
<A NAME="210"></A>month. But such embryos as are not fertile but are devoid of breath at 
<A NAME="211"></A>eight months old, their mothers do not bring into the world by parturition 
<A NAME="212"></A>at eight months, neither does the embryo descend within the womb at that 
<A NAME="213"></A>period nor does the womb open. And it is a sign that the embryo is not 
<A NAME="214"></A>capable of life if it be formed without the above-named circumstances taking 
<A NAME="215"></A>place.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>After conception women are prone to a feeling of heaviness in all 
<A NAME="217"></A>parts of their bodies, and for instance they experience a sensation of 
<A NAME="218"></A>darkness in front of the eyes and suffer also from headache. These symptoms 
<A NAME="219"></A>appear sooner or later, sometimes as early as the tenth day, according 
<A NAME="220"></A>as the patient be more or less burthened with superfluous humours. Nausea 
<A NAME="221"></A>also and sickness affect the most of women, and especially such as those 
<A NAME="222"></A>that we have just now mentioned, after the menstrual discharge has ceased 
<A NAME="223"></A>and before it is yet turned in the direction of the 
<A NAME="224"></A>breasts.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, some women suffer most at the beginning of their pregnancy 
<A NAME="226"></A>and some at a later period when the embryo has had time to grow; and in 
<A NAME="227"></A>some women it is a common occurrence to suffer from strangury towards the 
<A NAME="228"></A>end of their time. As a general rule women who are pregnant of a male child 
<A NAME="229"></A>escape comparatively easily and retain a comparatively healthy look, but 
<A NAME="230"></A>it is otherwise with those whose infant is a female; for these latter look 
<A NAME="231"></A>as a rule paler and suffer more pain, and in many cases they are subject 
<A NAME="232"></A>to swellings of the legs and eruptions on the body. Nevertheless the rule 
<A NAME="233"></A>is subject to exceptions.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>Women in pregnancy are a prey to all sorts of longings and to rapid 
<A NAME="235"></A>changes of mood, and some folks call this the 'ivy-sickness'; and with 
<A NAME="236"></A>the mothers of female infants the longings are more acute, and they are 
<A NAME="237"></A>less contented when they have got what they desired.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>In a certain few cases the patient feels unusually well during 
<A NAME="239"></A>pregnancy. The worst time of all is just when the child's hair is beginning 
<A NAME="240"></A>to grow.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>In pregnant women their own natural hair is inclined to grow thin 
<A NAME="242"></A>and fall out, but on the other hand hair tends to grow on parts of the 
<A NAME="243"></A>body where it was not wont to be. As a general rule, a man-child is more 
<A NAME="244"></A>prone to movement within its mother's womb than a female child, and it 
<A NAME="245"></A>is usually born sooner. And labour in the case of female children is apt 
<A NAME="246"></A>to be protracted and sluggish, while in the case of male children it is 
<A NAME="247"></A>acute and by a long way more difficult. Women who have connexion with their 
<A NAME="248"></A>husbands shortly before childbirth are delivered all the more quickly. 
<A NAME="249"></A>Occasionally women seem to be in the pains of labour though labour has 
<A NAME="250"></A>not in fact commenced, what seemed like the commencement of labour being 
<A NAME="251"></A>really the result of the foetus turning its head.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>Now all other animals bring the time of pregnancy to an end in 
<A NAME="253"></A>a uniform way; in other words, one single term of pregnancy is defined 
<A NAME="254"></A>for each of them. But in the case of mankind alone of all animals the times 
<A NAME="255"></A>are diverse; for pregnancy may be of seven months' duration, or of eight 
<A NAME="256"></A>months or of nine, and still more commonly of ten months, while some few 
<A NAME="257"></A>women go even into the eleventh month.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>Children that come into the world before seven months can under 
<A NAME="259"></A>no circumstances survive. The seven-months' children are the earliest that 
<A NAME="260"></A>are capable of life, and most of them are weakly-for which reason, by the 
<A NAME="261"></A>way, it is customary to swaddle them in wool,-and many of them are born 
<A NAME="262"></A>with some of the orifices of the body imperforate, for instance the ears 
<A NAME="263"></A>or the nostrils. But as they get bigger they become more perfectly developed, 
<A NAME="264"></A>and many of them grow up.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>In Egypt, and in some other places where the women are fruitful 
<A NAME="266"></A>and are wont to bear and bring forth many children without difficulty, 
<A NAME="267"></A>and where the children when born are capable of living even if they be 
<A NAME="268"></A>born subject to deformity, in these places the eight-months' children live 
<A NAME="269"></A>and are brought up, but in Greece it is only a few of them that survive 
<A NAME="270"></A>while most perish. And this being the general experience, when such a child 
<A NAME="271"></A>does happen to survive the mother is apt to think that it was not an eight 
<A NAME="272"></A>months' child after all, but that she had conceived at an earlier period 
<A NAME="273"></A>without being aware of it.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>Women suffer most pain about the fourth and the eighth months, 
<A NAME="275"></A>and if the foetus perishes in the fourth or in the eighth month the mother 
<A NAME="276"></A>also succumbs as a general rule; so that not only do the eight-months' 
<A NAME="277"></A>children not live, but when they die their mothers are in great danger 
<A NAME="278"></A>of their own lives. In like manner children that are apparently born at 
<A NAME="279"></A>a later term than eleven months are held to be in doubtful case; inasmuch 
<A NAME="280"></A>as with them also the beginning of conception may have escaped the notice 
<A NAME="281"></A>of the mother. What I mean to say is that often the womb gets filled with 
<A NAME="282"></A>wind, and then when at a later period connexion and conception take place, 
<A NAME="283"></A>they think that the former circumstance was the beginning of conception 
<A NAME="284"></A>from the similarity of the symptoms that they experienced.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>Such then are the differences between mankind and other animals 
<A NAME="286"></A>in regard to the many various modes of completion of the term of pregnancy. 
<A NAME="287"></A>Furthermore, some animals produce one and some produce many at a birth, 
<A NAME="288"></A>but the human species does sometimes the one and sometimes the other. As 
<A NAME="289"></A>a general rule and among most nations the women bear one child a birth; 
<A NAME="290"></A>but frequently and in many lands they bear twins, as for instance in Egypt 
<A NAME="291"></A>especially. Sometimes women bring forth three and even four children, and 
<A NAME="292"></A>especially in certain parts of the world, as has already been stated. The 
<A NAME="293"></A>largest number ever brought forth is five, and such an occurrence has been 
<A NAME="294"></A>witnessed on several occasions. There was once upon a time a certain women 
<A NAME="295"></A>who had twenty children at four births; each time she had five, and most 
<A NAME="296"></A>of them grew up.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>Now among other animals, if a pair of twins happen to be male and 
<A NAME="298"></A>female they have as good a chance of surviving as though both had been 
<A NAME="299"></A>males or both females; but among mankind very few twins survive if one 
<A NAME="300"></A>happen to be a boy and the other a girl.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>Of all animals the woman and the mare are most inclined to receive 
<A NAME="302"></A>the commerce of the male during pregnancy; while all other animals when 
<A NAME="303"></A>they are pregnant avoid the male, save those in which the phenomenon of 
<A NAME="304"></A>superfoetation occurs, such as the hare. Unlike that animal, the mare after 
<A NAME="305"></A>once conceiving cannot be rendered pregnant again, but brings forth one 
<A NAME="306"></A>foal only, at least as a general rule; in the human species cases of superfoetation 
<A NAME="307"></A>are rare, but they do happen now and then.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>An embryo conceived some considerable time after a previous conception 
<A NAME="309"></A>does not come to perfection, but gives rise to pain and causes the destruction 
<A NAME="310"></A>of the earlier embryo; and, by the way, a case has been known to occur 
<A NAME="311"></A>where owing to this destructive influence no less than twelve embryos conceived 
<A NAME="312"></A>by superfoetation have been discharged. But if the second conception take 
<A NAME="313"></A>place at a short interval, then the mother bears that which was later conceived, 
<A NAME="314"></A>and brings forth the two children like actual twins, as happened, according 
<A NAME="315"></A>to the legend, in the case of Iphicles and Hercules. The following also 
<A NAME="316"></A>is a striking example: a certain woman, having committed adultery, brought 
<A NAME="317"></A>forth the one child resembling her husband and the other resembling the 
<A NAME="318"></A>adulterous lover.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>The case has also occurred where a woman, being pregnant of twins, 
<A NAME="320"></A>has subsequently conceived a third child; and in course of time she brought 
<A NAME="321"></A>forth the twins perfect and at full term, but the third a five-months' 
<A NAME="322"></A>child; and this last died there and then. And in another case it happened 
<A NAME="323"></A>that the woman was first delivered of a seven-months' child, and then of 
<A NAME="324"></A>two which were of full term; and of these the first died and the other 
<A NAME="325"></A>two survived.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>Some also have been known to conceive while about to miscarry, 
<A NAME="327"></A>and they have lost the one child and been delivered of the 
<A NAME="328"></A>other.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>If women while going with child cohabit after the eighth month 
<A NAME="330"></A>the child is in most cases born covered over with a slimy fluid. Often 
<A NAME="331"></A>also the child is found to be replete with food of which the mother had 
<A NAME="332"></A>partaken.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="333"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>When women have partaken of salt in overabundance their children 
<A NAME="335"></A>are apt to be born destitute of nails.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>Milk that is produced earlier than the seventh month is unfit for 
<A NAME="337"></A>use; but as soon as the child is fit to live the milk is fit to use. The 
<A NAME="338"></A>first of the milk is saltish, as it is likewise with sheep. Most women 
<A NAME="339"></A>are sensibly affected by wine during pregnancy, for if they partake of 
<A NAME="340"></A>it they grow relaxed and debilitated.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>The beginning of child-bearing in women and of the capacity to 
<A NAME="342"></A>procreate in men, and the cessation of these functions in both cases, coincide 
<A NAME="343"></A>in the one case with the emission of seed and in the other with the discharge 
<A NAME="344"></A>of the catamenia: with this qualification that there is a lack of fertility 
<A NAME="345"></A>at the commencement of these symptoms, and again towards their close when 
<A NAME="346"></A>the emissions become scanty and weak. The age at which the sexual powers 
<A NAME="347"></A>begin has been related already. As for their end, the menstrual discharges 
<A NAME="348"></A>ceases in most women about their fortieth year; but with those in whom 
<A NAME="349"></A>it goes on longer it lasts even to the fiftieth year, and women of that 
<A NAME="350"></A>age have been known to bear children. But beyond that age there is no case 
<A NAME="351"></A>on record.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="352"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>Men in most cases continue to be sexually competent until they 
<A NAME="354"></A>are sixty years old, and if that limit be overpassed then until seventy 
<A NAME="355"></A>years; and men have been actually known to procreate children at seventy 
<A NAME="356"></A>years of age. With many men and many women it so happens that they are 
<A NAME="357"></A>unable to produce children to one another, while they are able to do so 
<A NAME="358"></A>in union with other individuals. The same thing happens with regard to 
<A NAME="359"></A>the production of male and female offspring; for sometimes men and women 
<A NAME="360"></A>in union with one another produce male children or female, as the case 
<A NAME="361"></A>may be, but children of the opposite sex when otherwise mated. And they 
<A NAME="362"></A>are apt to change in this respect with advancing age: for sometimes a husband 
<A NAME="363"></A>and wife while they are young produce female children and in later life 
<A NAME="364"></A>male children; and in other cases the very contrary occurs. And just the 
<A NAME="365"></A>same thing is true in regard to the generative faculty: for some while 
<A NAME="366"></A>young are childless, but have children when they grow older; and some have 
<A NAME="367"></A>children to begin with, and later on no more.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>There are certain women who conceive with difficulty, but if they 
<A NAME="369"></A>do conceive, bring the child to maturity; while others again conceive readily, 
<A NAME="370"></A>but are unable to bring the child to birth. Furthermore, some men and some 
<A NAME="371"></A>women produce female offspring and some male, as for instance in the story 
<A NAME="372"></A>of Hercules, who among all his two and seventy children is said to have 
<A NAME="373"></A>begotten but one girl. Those women who are unable to conceive, save with 
<A NAME="374"></A>the help of medical treatment or some other adventitious circumstance, 
<A NAME="375"></A>are as a general rule apt to bear female children rather than 
<A NAME="376"></A>male.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>It is a common thing with men to be at first sexually competent 
<A NAME="378"></A>and afterwards impotent, and then again to revert to their former 
<A NAME="379"></A>powers.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>From deformed parents come deformed children, lame from lame and 
<A NAME="381"></A>blind from blind, and, speaking generally, children often inherit anything 
<A NAME="382"></A>that is peculiar in their parents and are born with similar marks, such 
<A NAME="383"></A>as pimples or scars. Such things have been known to be handed down through 
<A NAME="384"></A>three generations; for instance, a certain man had a mark on his arm which 
<A NAME="385"></A>his son did not possess, but his grandson had it in the same spot though 
<A NAME="386"></A>not very distinct.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>Such cases, however, are few; for the children of cripples are 
<A NAME="388"></A>mostly sound, and there is no hard and fast rule regarding them. While 
<A NAME="389"></A>children mostly resemble their parents or their ancestors, it sometimes 
<A NAME="390"></A>happens that no such resemblance is to be traced. But parents may pass 
<A NAME="391"></A>on resemblance after several generations, as in the case of the woman in 
<A NAME="392"></A>Elis, who committed adultery with a negro; in this case it was not the 
<A NAME="393"></A>woman's own daughter but the daughter's child that was a 
<A NAME="394"></A>blackamoor.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>As a rule the daughters have a tendency to take after the mother, 
<A NAME="396"></A>and the boys after the father; but sometimes it is the other way, the boys 
<A NAME="397"></A>taking after the mother and the girls after the father. And they may resemble 
<A NAME="398"></A>both parents in particular features.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>There have been known cases of twins that had no resemblance to 
<A NAME="400"></A>one another, but they are alike as a general rule. There was once upon 
<A NAME="401"></A>a time a woman who had intercourse with her husband a week after giving 
<A NAME="402"></A>birth to a child and she conceived and bore a second child as like the 
<A NAME="403"></A>first as any twin. Some women have a tendency to produce children that 
<A NAME="404"></A>take after themselves, and others children that take after the husband; 
<A NAME="405"></A>and this latter case is like that of the celebrated mare in Pharsalus, 
<A NAME="406"></A>that got the name of the Honest Wife.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="407"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>In the emission of sperm there is a preliminary discharge of air, 
<A NAME="409"></A>and the outflow is manifestly caused by a blast of air; for nothing is 
<A NAME="410"></A>cast to a distance save by pneumatic pressure. After the seed reaches the 
<A NAME="411"></A>womb and remains there for a while, a membrane forms around it; for when 
<A NAME="412"></A>it happens to escape before it is distinctly formed, it looks like an egg 
<A NAME="413"></A>enveloped in its membrane after removal of the eggshell; and the membrane 
<A NAME="414"></A>is full of veins.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>All animals whatsoever, whether they fly or swim or walk upon dry 
<A NAME="416"></A>land, whether they bring forth their young alive or in the egg, develop 
<A NAME="417"></A>in the same way: save only that some have the navel attached to the womb, 
<A NAME="418"></A>namely the viviparous animals, and some have it attached to the egg, and 
<A NAME="419"></A>some to both parts alike, as in a certain sort of fishes. And in some cases 
<A NAME="420"></A>membranous envelopes surround the egg, and in other cases the chorion surrounds 
<A NAME="421"></A>it. And first of all the animal develops within the innermost envelope, 
<A NAME="422"></A>and then another membrane appears around the former one, which latter is 
<A NAME="423"></A>for the most part attached to the womb, but is in part separated from it 
<A NAME="424"></A>and contains fluid. In between is a watery or sanguineous fluid, which 
<A NAME="425"></A>the women folk call the forewaters.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="426"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>All animals, or all such as have a navel, grow by the navel. And 
<A NAME="428"></A>the navel is attached to the cotyledon in all such as possess cotyledons, 
<A NAME="429"></A>and to the womb itself by a vein in all such as have the womb smooth. And 
<A NAME="430"></A>as regards their shape within the womb, the four-footed animals all lie 
<A NAME="431"></A>stretched out, and the footless animals lie on their sides, as for instance 
<A NAME="432"></A>fishes; but two-legged animals lie in a bent position, as for instance 
<A NAME="433"></A>birds; and human embryos lie bent, with nose between the knees and eyes 
<A NAME="434"></A>upon the knees, and the ears free at the sides.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>All animals alike have the head upwards to begin with; but as they 
<A NAME="436"></A>grow and approach the term of egress from the womb they turn downwards, 
<A NAME="437"></A>and birth in the natural course of things takes place in all animals head 
<A NAME="438"></A>foremost; but in abnormal cases it may take place in a bent position, or 
<A NAME="439"></A>feet foremost.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>The young of quadrupeds when they are near their full time contain 
<A NAME="441"></A>excrements, both liquid and in the form of solid lumps, the latter in the 
<A NAME="442"></A>lower part of the bowel and the urine in the bladder.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>In those animals that have cotyledons in the womb the cotyledons 
<A NAME="444"></A>grow less as the embryo grows bigger, and at length they disappear altogether. 
<A NAME="445"></A>The navel-string is a sheath wrapped about blood-vessels which have their 
<A NAME="446"></A>origin in the womb, from the cotyledons in those animals which possess 
<A NAME="447"></A>them and from a blood-vessel in those which do not. In the larger animals, 
<A NAME="448"></A>such as the embryos of oxen, the vessels are four in number, and in smaller 
<A NAME="449"></A>animals two; in the very little ones, such as fowls, one vessel 
<A NAME="450"></A>only.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>Of the four vessels that run into the embryo, two pass through 
<A NAME="452"></A>the liver where the so-called gates or 'portae' are, running in the direction 
<A NAME="453"></A>of the great vein, and the other two run in the direction of the aorta 
<A NAME="454"></A>towards the point where it divides and becomes two vessels instead of one. 
<A NAME="455"></A>Around each pair of blood-vessels are membranes, and surrounding these 
<A NAME="456"></A>membranes is the navel-string itself, after the manner of a sheath. And 
<A NAME="457"></A>as the embryo grows, the veins themselves tend more and more to dwindle 
<A NAME="458"></A>in size. And also as the embryo matures it comes down into the hollow of 
<A NAME="459"></A>the womb and is observed to move here, and sometimes rolls over in the 
<A NAME="460"></A>vicinity of the groin.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="461"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR>When women are in labour, their pains determine towards many divers 
<A NAME="463"></A>parts of the body, and in most cases to one or other of the thighs. Those 
<A NAME="464"></A>are the quickest to be delivered who experience severe pains in the region 
<A NAME="465"></A>of the belly; and parturition is difficult in those who begin by suffering 
<A NAME="466"></A>pain in the loins, and speedy when the pain is abdominal. If the child 
<A NAME="467"></A>about to be born be a male, the preliminary flood is watery and pale in 
<A NAME="468"></A>colour, but if a girl it is tinged with blood, though still watery. In 
<A NAME="469"></A>some cases of labour these latter phenomena do not occur, either one way 
<A NAME="470"></A>or the other.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>In other animals parturition is unaccompanied by pain, and the 
<A NAME="472"></A>dam is plainly seen to suffer but moderate inconvenience. In women, however, 
<A NAME="473"></A>the pains are more severe, and this is especially the case in persons of 
<A NAME="474"></A>sedentary habits, and in those who are weak-chested and short of breath. 
<A NAME="475"></A>Labour is apt to be especially difficult if during the process the woman 
<A NAME="476"></A>while exerting force with her breath fails to hold it 
<A NAME="477"></A>in.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>First of all, when the embryo starts to move and the membranes 
<A NAME="479"></A>burst, there issues forth the watery flood; then afterwards comes the embryo, 
<A NAME="480"></A>while the womb everts and the afterbirth comes out from 
<A NAME="481"></A>within.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="482"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>The cutting of the navel-string, which is the nurse's duty, is 
<A NAME="484"></A>a matter calling for no little care and skill. For not only in cases of 
<A NAME="485"></A>difficult labour must she be able to render assistance with skilful hand, 
<A NAME="486"></A>but she must also have her wits about her in all contingencies, and especially 
<A NAME="487"></A>in the operation of tying the cord. For if the afterbirth have come away, 
<A NAME="488"></A>the navel is ligatured off from the afterbirth with a woollen thread and 
<A NAME="489"></A>is then cut above the ligature; and at the place where it has been tied 
<A NAME="490"></A>it heals up, and the remaining portion drops off. (If the ligature come 
<A NAME="491"></A>loose the child dies from loss of blood.) But if the afterbirth has not 
<A NAME="492"></A>yet come away, but remains after the child itself is extruded, it is cut 
<A NAME="493"></A>away within after the ligaturing of the cord.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR>It often happens that the child appears to have been born dead 
<A NAME="495"></A>when it is merely weak, and when before the umbilical cord has been ligatured, 
<A NAME="496"></A>the blood has run out into the cord and its surroundings. But experienced 
<A NAME="497"></A>midwives have been known to squeeze back the blood into the child's body 
<A NAME="498"></A>from the cord, and immediately the child that a moment before was bloodless 
<A NAME="499"></A>came back to life again.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>It is the natural rule, as we have mentioned above, for all animals 
<A NAME="501"></A>to come into the world head foremost, and children, moreover, have their 
<A NAME="502"></A>hands stretched out by their sides. And the child gives a cry and puts 
<A NAME="503"></A>its hands up to its mouth as soon as it issues forth.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>Moreover the child voids excrement sometimes at once, sometimes 
<A NAME="505"></A>a little later, but in all cases during the first day; and this excrement 
<A NAME="506"></A>is unduly copious in comparison with the size of the child; it is what 
<A NAME="507"></A>the midwives call the meconium or 'poppy-juice'. In colour it resembles 
<A NAME="508"></A>blood, extremely dark and pitch-like, but later on it becomes milky, for 
<A NAME="509"></A>the child takes at once to the breast. Before birth the child makes no 
<A NAME="510"></A>sound, even though in difficult labour it put forth its head while the 
<A NAME="511"></A>rest of the body remains within.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>In cases where flooding takes place rather before its time, it 
<A NAME="513"></A>is apt to be followed by difficult parturition. But if discharge take place 
<A NAME="514"></A>after birth in small quantity, and in cases where it only takes place at 
<A NAME="515"></A>the beginning and does not continue till the fortieth day, then in such 
<A NAME="516"></A>cases women make a better recovery and are the sooner ready to conceive 
<A NAME="517"></A>again.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>Until the child is forty days old it neither laughs nor weeps during 
<A NAME="519"></A>waking hours, but of nights it sometimes does both; and for the most part 
<A NAME="520"></A>it does not even notice being tickled, but passes most of its time in sleep. 
<A NAME="521"></A>As it keeps on growing, it gets more and more wakeful; and moreover it 
<A NAME="522"></A>shows signs of dreaming, though it is long afterwards before it remembers 
<A NAME="523"></A>what it dreams.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>In other animals there is no contrasting difference between one 
<A NAME="525"></A>bone and another, but all are properly formed; but in children the front 
<A NAME="526"></A>part of the head is soft and late of ossifying. And by the way, some animals 
<A NAME="527"></A>are born with teeth, but children begin to cut their teeth in the seventh 
<A NAME="528"></A>month; and the front teeth are the first to come through, sometimes the 
<A NAME="529"></A>upper and sometimes the lower ones. And the warmer the nurses' milk so 
<A NAME="530"></A>much the quicker are the children's teeth to come.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="531"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR>After parturition and the cleasing flood the milk comes in plenty, 
<A NAME="533"></A>and in some women it flows not only from the nipples but at divers parts 
<A NAME="534"></A>of the breasts, and in some cases even from the armpits. And for some time 
<A NAME="535"></A>afterwards there continue to be certain indurated parts of the breast called 
<A NAME="536"></A>strangalides, or 'knots', which occur when it so happens that the moisture 
<A NAME="537"></A>is not concocted, or when it finds no outlet but accumulates within. For 
<A NAME="538"></A>the whole breast is so spongy that if a woman in drinking happen to swallow 
<A NAME="539"></A>a hair, she gets a pain in her breast, which ailment is called 'trichia'; 
<A NAME="540"></A>and the pain lasts till the hair either find its own way out or be sucked 
<A NAME="541"></A>out with the milk. Women continue to have milk until their next conception; 
<A NAME="542"></A>and then the milk stops coming and goes dry, alike in the human species 
<A NAME="543"></A>and in the quadrupedal vivipara. So long as there is a flow of milk the 
<A NAME="544"></A>menstrual purgations do not take place, at least as a general rule, though 
<A NAME="545"></A>the discharge has been known to occur during the period of suckling. For, 
<A NAME="546"></A>speaking generally, a determination of moisture does not take place at 
<A NAME="547"></A>one and the same time in several directions; as for instance the menstrual 
<A NAME="548"></A>purgations tend to be scanty in persons suffering from haemorrhoids. And 
<A NAME="549"></A>in some women the like happens owing to their suffering from varices, when 
<A NAME="550"></A>the fluids issue from the pelvic region before entering into the womb. 
<A NAME="551"></A>And patients who during suppression of the menses happen to vomit blood 
<A NAME="552"></A>are no whit the worse.

<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>Children are very commonly subject to convulsions, more especially 
<A NAME="555"></A>such of them as are more than ordinarily well-nourished on rich or unusually 
<A NAME="556"></A>plentiful milk from a stout nurse. Wine is bad for infants, in that it 
<A NAME="557"></A>tends to excite this malady, and red wine is worse than white, especially 
<A NAME="558"></A>when taken undiluted; and most things that tend to induce flatulency are 
<A NAME="559"></A>also bad, and constipation too is prejudicial. The majority of deaths in 
<A NAME="560"></A>infancy occur before the child is a week old, hence it is customary to 
<A NAME="561"></A>name the child at that age, from a belief that it has now a better chance 
<A NAME="562"></A>of survival. This malady is worst at the full of the moon; and by the way, 
<A NAME="563"></A>it is a dangerous symptom when the spasms begin in the child's 
<A NAME="564"></A>back.
