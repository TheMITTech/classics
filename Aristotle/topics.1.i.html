<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Our treatise proposes to find a line of inquiry whereby we shall be able 
<A NAME="12"></A>to reason from opinions that are generally accepted about every problem 
<A NAME="13"></A>propounded to us, and also shall ourselves, when standing up to an argument, 
<A NAME="14"></A>avoid saying anything that will obstruct us. First, then, we must say what 
<A NAME="15"></A>reasoning is, and what its varieties are, in order to grasp dialectical 
<A NAME="16"></A>reasoning: for this is the object of our search in the treatise before 
<A NAME="17"></A>us.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>Now reasoning is an argument in which, certain things being laid 
<A NAME="19"></A>down, something other than these necessarily comes about through them. 
<A NAME="20"></A>(a) It is a 'demonstration', when the premisses from which the reasoning 
<A NAME="21"></A>starts are true and primary, or are such that our knowledge of them has 
<A NAME="22"></A>originally come through premisses which are primary and true: (b) reasoning, 
<A NAME="23"></A>on the other hand, is 'dialectical', if it reasons from opinions that are 
<A NAME="24"></A>generally accepted. Things are 'true' and 'primary' which are believed 
<A NAME="25"></A>on the strength not of anything else but of themselves: for in regard to 
<A NAME="26"></A>the first principles of science it is improper to ask any further for the 
<A NAME="27"></A>why and wherefore of them; each of the first principles should command 
<A NAME="28"></A>belief in and by itself. On the other hand, those opinions are 'generally 
<A NAME="29"></A>accepted' which are accepted by every one or by the majority or by the 
<A NAME="30"></A>philosophers-i.e. by all, or by the majority, or by the most notable and 
<A NAME="31"></A>illustrious of them. Again (c), reasoning is 'contentious' if it starts 
<A NAME="32"></A>from opinions that seem to be generally accepted, but are not really such, 
<A NAME="33"></A>or again if it merely seems to reason from opinions that are or seem to 
<A NAME="34"></A>be generally accepted. For not every opinion that seems to be generally 
<A NAME="35"></A>accepted actually is generally accepted. For in none of the opinions which 
<A NAME="36"></A>we call generally accepted is the illusion entirely on the surface, as 
<A NAME="37"></A>happens in the case of the principles of contentious arguments; for the 
<A NAME="38"></A>nature of the fallacy in these is obvious immediately, and as a rule even 
<A NAME="39"></A>to persons with little power of comprehension. So then, of the contentious 
<A NAME="40"></A>reasonings mentioned, the former really deserves to be called 'reasoning' 
<A NAME="41"></A>as well, but the other should be called 'contentious reasoning', but not 
<A NAME="42"></A>'reasoning', since it appears to reason, but does not really do so. Further 
<A NAME="43"></A>(d), besides all the reasonings we have mentioned there are the mis-reasonings 
<A NAME="44"></A>that start from the premisses peculiar to the special sciences, as happens 
<A NAME="45"></A>(for example) in the case of geometry and her sister sciences. For this 
<A NAME="46"></A>form of reasoning appears to differ from the reasonings mentioned above; 
<A NAME="47"></A>the man who draws a false figure reasons from things that are neither true 
<A NAME="48"></A>and primary, nor yet generally accepted. For he does not fall within the 
<A NAME="49"></A>definition; he does not assume opinions that are received either by every 
<A NAME="50"></A>one or by the majority or by philosophers-that is to say, by all, or by 
<A NAME="51"></A>most, or by the most illustrious of them-but he conducts his reasoning 
<A NAME="52"></A>upon assumptions which, though appropriate to the science in question, 
<A NAME="53"></A>are not true; for he effects his mis-reasoning either by describing the 
<A NAME="54"></A>semicircles wrongly or by drawing certain lines in a way in which they 
<A NAME="55"></A>could not be drawn.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>The foregoing must stand for an outline survey of the species of 
<A NAME="57"></A>reasoning. In general, in regard both to all that we have already discussed 
<A NAME="58"></A>and to those which we shall discuss later, we may remark that that amount 
<A NAME="59"></A>of distinction between them may serve, because it is not our purpose to 
<A NAME="60"></A>give the exact definition of any of them; we merely want to describe them 
<A NAME="61"></A>in outline; we consider it quite enough from the point of view of the line 
<A NAME="62"></A>of inquiry before us to be able to recognize each of them in some sort 
<A NAME="63"></A>of way.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="64"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>Next in order after the foregoing, we must say for how many and 
<A NAME="66"></A>for what purposes the treatise is useful. They are three-intellectual training, 
<A NAME="67"></A>casual encounters, and the philosophical sciences. That it is useful as 
<A NAME="68"></A>a training is obvious on the face of it. The possession of a plan of inquiry 
<A NAME="69"></A>will enable us more easily to argue about the subject proposed. For purposes 
<A NAME="70"></A>of casual encounters, it is useful because when we have counted up the 
<A NAME="71"></A>opinions held by most people, we shall meet them on the ground not of other 
<A NAME="72"></A>people's convictions but of their own, while we shift the ground of any 
<A NAME="73"></A>argument that they appear to us to state unsoundly. For the study of the 
<A NAME="74"></A>philosophical sciences it is useful, because the ability to raise searching 
<A NAME="75"></A>difficulties on both sides of a subject will make us detect more easily 
<A NAME="76"></A>the truth and error about the several points that arise. It has a further 
<A NAME="77"></A>use in relation to the ultimate bases of the principles used in the several 
<A NAME="78"></A>sciences. For it is impossible to discuss them at all from the principles 
<A NAME="79"></A>proper to the particular science in hand, seeing that the principles are 
<A NAME="80"></A>the prius of everything else: it is through the opinions generally held 
<A NAME="81"></A>on the particular points that these have to be discussed, and this task 
<A NAME="82"></A>belongs properly, or most appropriately, to dialectic: for dialectic is 
<A NAME="83"></A>a process of criticism wherein lies the path to the principles of all 
<A NAME="84"></A>inquiries.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="85"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>We shall be in perfect possession of the way to proceed when we 
<A NAME="87"></A>are in a position like that which we occupy in regard to rhetoric and medicine 
<A NAME="88"></A>and faculties of that kind: this means the doing of that which we choose 
<A NAME="89"></A>with the materials that are available. For it is not every method that 
<A NAME="90"></A>the rhetorician will employ to persuade, or the doctor to heal; still, 
<A NAME="91"></A>if he omits none of the available means, we shall say that his grasp of 
<A NAME="92"></A>the science is adequate.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="93"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>First, then, we must see of what parts our inquiry consists. Now 
<A NAME="95"></A>if we were to grasp (a) with reference to how many, and what kind of, things 
<A NAME="96"></A>arguments take place, and with what materials they start, and (h) how we 
<A NAME="97"></A>are to become well supplied with these, we should have sufficiently won 
<A NAME="98"></A>our goal. Now the materials with which arguments start are equal in number, 
<A NAME="99"></A>and are identical, with the subjects on which reasonings take place. For 
<A NAME="100"></A>arguments start with 'propositions', while the subjects on which reasonings 
<A NAME="101"></A>take place are 'problems'. Now every proposition and every problem indicates 
<A NAME="102"></A>either a genus or a peculiarity or an accident-for the differentia too, 
<A NAME="103"></A>applying as it does to a class (or genus), should be ranked together with 
<A NAME="104"></A>the genus. Since, however, of what is peculiar to anything part signifies 
<A NAME="105"></A>its essence, while part does not, let us divide the 'peculiar' into both 
<A NAME="106"></A>the aforesaid parts, and call that part which indicates the essence a 'definition', 
<A NAME="107"></A>while of the remainder let us adopt the terminology which is generally 
<A NAME="108"></A>current about these things, and speak of it as a 'property'. What we have 
<A NAME="109"></A>said, then, makes it clear that according to our present division, the 
<A NAME="110"></A>elements turn out to be four, all told, namely either property or definition 
<A NAME="111"></A>or genus or accident. Do not let any one suppose us to mean that each of 
<A NAME="112"></A>these enunciated by itself constitutes a proposition or problem, but only 
<A NAME="113"></A>that it is from these that both problems and propositions are formed. The 
<A NAME="114"></A>difference between a problem and a proposition is a difference in the turn 
<A NAME="115"></A>of the phrase. For if it be put in this way, "'An animal that walks on 
<A NAME="116"></A>two feet" is the definition of man, is it not?' or '"Animal" is the genus 
<A NAME="117"></A>of man, is it not?' the result is a proposition: but if thus, 'Is "an animal 
<A NAME="118"></A>that walks on two feet" a definition of man or no?' [or 'Is "animal" his 
<A NAME="119"></A>genus or no?'] the result is a problem. Similarly too in other cases. Naturally, 
<A NAME="120"></A>then, problems and propositions are equal in number: for out of every proposition 
<A NAME="121"></A>you will make a problem if you change the turn of the 
<A NAME="122"></A>phrase.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="123"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>We must now say what are 'definition', 'property', 'genus', and 
<A NAME="125"></A>'accident'. A 'definition' is a phrase signifying a thing's essence. It 
<A NAME="126"></A>is rendered in the form either of a phrase in lieu of a term, or of a phrase 
<A NAME="127"></A>in lieu of another phrase; for it is sometimes possible to define the meaning 
<A NAME="128"></A>of a phrase as well. People whose rendering consists of a term only, try 
<A NAME="129"></A>it as they may, clearly do not render the definition of the thing in question, 
<A NAME="130"></A>because a definition is always a phrase of a certain kind. One may, however, 
<A NAME="131"></A>use the word 'definitory' also of such a remark as 'The "becoming" is "beautiful"', 
<A NAME="132"></A>and likewise also of the question, 'Are sensation and knowledge the same 
<A NAME="133"></A>or different?', for argument about definitions is mostly concerned with 
<A NAME="134"></A>questions of sameness and difference. In a word we may call 'definitory' 
<A NAME="135"></A>everything that falls under the same branch of inquiry as definitions; 
<A NAME="136"></A>and that all the above-mentioned examples are of this character is clear 
<A NAME="137"></A>on the face of them. For if we are able to argue that two things are the 
<A NAME="138"></A>same or are different, we shall be well supplied by the same turn of argument 
<A NAME="139"></A>with lines of attack upon their definitions as well: for when we have shown 
<A NAME="140"></A>that they are not the same we shall have demolished the definition. Observe, 
<A NAME="141"></A>please, that the converse of this last statement does not hold: for to 
<A NAME="142"></A>show that they are the same is not enough to establish a definition. To 
<A NAME="143"></A>show, however, that they are not the same is enough of itself to overthrow 
<A NAME="144"></A>it.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>A 'property' is a predicate which does not indicate the essence 
<A NAME="146"></A>of a thing, but yet belongs to that thing alone, and is predicated convertibly 
<A NAME="147"></A>of it. Thus it is a property of man to-be-capable of learning grammar: 
<A NAME="148"></A>for if A be a man, then he is capable of learning grammar, and if he be 
<A NAME="149"></A>capable of learning grammar, he is a man. For no one calls anything a 'property' 
<A NAME="150"></A>which may possibly belong to something else, e.g. 'sleep' in the case of 
<A NAME="151"></A>man, even though at a certain time it may happen to belong to him alone. 
<A NAME="152"></A>That is to say, if any such thing were actually to be called a property, 
<A NAME="153"></A>it will be called not a 'property' absolutely, but a 'temporary' or a 'relative' 
<A NAME="154"></A>property: for 'being on the right hand side' is a temporary property, while 
<A NAME="155"></A>'two-footed' is in point of fact ascribed as a property in certain relations; 
<A NAME="156"></A>e.g. it is a property of man relatively to a horse and a dog. That nothing 
<A NAME="157"></A>which may belong to anything else than A is a convertible predicate of 
<A NAME="158"></A>A is clear: for it does not necessarily follow that if something is asleep 
<A NAME="159"></A>it is a man.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>A 'genus' is what is predicated in the category of essence of a 
<A NAME="161"></A>number of things exhibiting differences in kind. We should treat as predicates 
<A NAME="162"></A>in the category of essence all such things as it would be appropriate to 
<A NAME="163"></A>mention in reply to the question, 'What is the object before you?'; as, 
<A NAME="164"></A>for example, in the case of man, if asked that question, it is appropriate 
<A NAME="165"></A>to say 'He is an animal'. The question, 'Is one thing in the same genus 
<A NAME="166"></A>as another or in a different one?' is also a 'generic' question; for a 
<A NAME="167"></A>question of that kind as well falls under the same branch of inquiry as 
<A NAME="168"></A>the genus: for having argued that 'animal' is the genus of man, and likewise 
<A NAME="169"></A>also of ox, we shall have argued that they are in the same genus; whereas 
<A NAME="170"></A>if we show that it is the genus of the one but not of the other, we shall 
<A NAME="171"></A>have argued that these things are not in the same genus.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>An 'accident' is (i) something which, though it is none of the 
<A NAME="173"></A>foregoing-i.e. neither a definition nor a property nor a genus yet belongs 
<A NAME="174"></A>to the thing: (something which may possibly either belong or not belong 
<A NAME="175"></A>to any one and the self-same thing, as (e.g.) the 'sitting posture' may 
<A NAME="176"></A>belong or not belong to some self-same thing. Likewise also 'whiteness', 
<A NAME="177"></A>for there is nothing to prevent the same thing being at one time white, 
<A NAME="178"></A>and at another not white. Of the definitions of accident the second is 
<A NAME="179"></A>the better: for if he adopts the first, any one is bound, if he is to understand 
<A NAME="180"></A>it, to know already what 'definition' and 'genus' and 'property' are, whereas 
<A NAME="181"></A>the second is sufficient of itself to tell us the essential meaning of 
<A NAME="182"></A>the term in question. To Accident are to be attached also all comparisons 
<A NAME="183"></A>of things together, when expressed in language that is drawn in any kind 
<A NAME="184"></A>of way from what happens (accidit) to be true of them; such as, for example, 
<A NAME="185"></A>the question, 'Is the honourable or the expedient preferable?' and 'Is 
<A NAME="186"></A>the life of virtue or the life of self-indulgence the pleasanter?', and 
<A NAME="187"></A>any other problem which may happen to be phrased in terms like these. For 
<A NAME="188"></A>in all such cases the question is 'to which of the two does the predicate 
<A NAME="189"></A>in question happen (accidit) to belong more closely?' It is clear on the 
<A NAME="190"></A>face of it that there is nothing to prevent an accident from becoming a 
<A NAME="191"></A>temporary or relative property. Thus the sitting posture is an accident, 
<A NAME="192"></A>but will be a temporary property, whenever a man is the only person sitting, 
<A NAME="193"></A>while if he be not the only one sitting, it is still a property relatively 
<A NAME="194"></A>to those who are not sitting. So then, there is nothing to prevent an accident 
<A NAME="195"></A>from becoming both a relative and a temporary property; but a property 
<A NAME="196"></A>absolutely it will never be.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="197"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>We must not fail to observe that all remarks made in criticism 
<A NAME="199"></A>of a 'property' and 'genus' and 'accident' will be applicable to 'definitions' 
<A NAME="200"></A>as well. For when we have shown that the attribute in question fails to 
<A NAME="201"></A>belong only to the term defined, as we do also in the case of a property, 
<A NAME="202"></A>or that the genus rendered in the definition is not the true genus, or 
<A NAME="203"></A>that any of the things mentioned in the phrase used does not belong, as 
<A NAME="204"></A>would be remarked also in the case of an accident, we shall have demolished 
<A NAME="205"></A>the definition; so that, to use the phrase previously employed,' all the 
<A NAME="206"></A>points we have enumerated might in a certain sense be called 'definitory'. 
<A NAME="207"></A>But we must not on this account expect to find a single line of inquiry 
<A NAME="208"></A>which will apply universally to them all: for this is not an easy thing 
<A NAME="209"></A>to find, and, even were one found, it would be very obscure indeed, and 
<A NAME="210"></A>of little service for the treatise before us. Rather, a special plan of 
<A NAME="211"></A>inquiry must be laid down for each of the classes we have distinguished, 
<A NAME="212"></A>and then, starting from the rules that are appropriate in each case, it 
<A NAME="213"></A>will probably be easier to make our way right through the task before us. 
<A NAME="214"></A>So then, as was said before,' we must outline a division of our subject, 
<A NAME="215"></A>and other questions we must relegate each to the particular branch to which 
<A NAME="216"></A>it most naturally belongs, speaking of them as 'definitory' and 'generic' 
<A NAME="217"></A>questions. The questions I mean have practically been already assigned 
<A NAME="218"></A>to their several branches.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="219"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>First of all we must define the number of senses borne by the term 
<A NAME="221"></A>'Sameness'. Sameness would be generally regarded as falling, roughly speaking, 
<A NAME="222"></A>into three divisions. We generally apply the term numerically or specifically 
<A NAME="223"></A>or generically-numerically in cases where there is more than one name but 
<A NAME="224"></A>only one thing, e.g. 'doublet' and 'cloak'; specifically, where there is 
<A NAME="225"></A>more than one thing, but they present no differences in respect of their 
<A NAME="226"></A>species, as one man and another, or one horse and another: for things like 
<A NAME="227"></A>this that fall under the same species are said to be 'specifically the 
<A NAME="228"></A>same'. Similarly, too, those things are called generically the same which 
<A NAME="229"></A>fall under the same genus, such as a horse and a man. It might appear that 
<A NAME="230"></A>the sense in which water from the same spring is called 'the same water' 
<A NAME="231"></A>is somehow different and unlike the senses mentioned above: but really 
<A NAME="232"></A>such a case as this ought to be ranked in the same class with the things 
<A NAME="233"></A>that in one way or another are called 'the same' in view of unity of species. 
<A NAME="234"></A>For all such things seem to be of one family and to resemble one another. 
<A NAME="235"></A>For the reaon why all water is said to be specifically the same as all 
<A NAME="236"></A>other water is because of a certain likeness it bears to it, and the only 
<A NAME="237"></A>difference in the case of water drawn from the same spring is this, that 
<A NAME="238"></A>the likeness is more emphatic: that is why we do not distinguish it from 
<A NAME="239"></A>the things that in one way or another are called 'the same' in view of 
<A NAME="240"></A>unity of species. It is generally supposed that the term 'the same' is 
<A NAME="241"></A>most used in a sense agreed on by every one when applied to what is numerically 
<A NAME="242"></A>one. But even so, it is apt to be rendered in more than one sense; its 
<A NAME="243"></A>most literal and primary use is found whenever the sameness is rendered 
<A NAME="244"></A>in reference to an alternative name or definition, as when a cloak is said 
<A NAME="245"></A>to be the same as a doublet, or an animal that walks on two feet is said 
<A NAME="246"></A>to be the same as a man: a second sense is when it is rendered in reference 
<A NAME="247"></A>to a property, as when what can acquire knowledge is called the same as 
<A NAME="248"></A>a man, and what naturally travels upward the same as fire: while a third 
<A NAME="249"></A>use is found when it is rendered in reference to some term drawn from Accident, 
<A NAME="250"></A>as when the creature who is sitting, or who is musical, is called the same 
<A NAME="251"></A>as Socrates. For all these uses mean to signify numerical unity. That what 
<A NAME="252"></A>I have just said is true may be best seen where one form of appellation 
<A NAME="253"></A>is substituted for another. For often when we give the order to call one 
<A NAME="254"></A>of the people who are sitting down, indicating him by name, we change our 
<A NAME="255"></A>description, whenever the person to whom we give the order happens not 
<A NAME="256"></A>to understand us; he will, we think, understand better from some accidental 
<A NAME="257"></A>feature; so we bid him call to us 'the man who is sitting' or 'who is conversing 
<A NAME="258"></A>over there'-clearly supposing ourselves to be indicating the same object 
<A NAME="259"></A>by its name and by its accident.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="260"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>Of 'sameness' then, as has been said,' three senses are to be distinguished. 
<A NAME="262"></A>Now one way to confirm that the elements mentioned above are those out 
<A NAME="263"></A>of which and through which and to which arguments proceed, is by induction: 
<A NAME="264"></A>for if any one were to survey propositions and problems one by one, it 
<A NAME="265"></A>would be seen that each was formed either from the definition of something 
<A NAME="266"></A>or from its property or from its genus or from its accident. Another way 
<A NAME="267"></A>to confirm it is through reasoning. For every predicate of a subject must 
<A NAME="268"></A>of necessity be either convertible with its subject or not: and if it is 
<A NAME="269"></A>convertible, it would be its definition or property, for if it signifies 
<A NAME="270"></A>the essence, it is the definition; if not, it is a property: for this was 
<A NAME="271"></A>what a property is, viz. what is predicated convertibly, but does not signify 
<A NAME="272"></A>the essence. If, on the other hand, it is not predicated convertibly of 
<A NAME="273"></A>the thing, it either is or is not one of the terms contained in the definition 
<A NAME="274"></A>of the subject: and if it be one of those terms, then it will be the genus 
<A NAME="275"></A>or the differentia, inasmuch as the definition consists of genus and differentiae; 
<A NAME="276"></A>whereas, if it be not one of those terms, clearly it would be an accident, 
<A NAME="277"></A>for accident was said' to be what belongs as an attribute to a subject 
<A NAME="278"></A>without being either its definition or its genus or a 
<A NAME="279"></A>property.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="280"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>Next, then, we must distinguish between the classes of predicates 
<A NAME="282"></A>in which the four orders in question are found. These are ten in number: 
<A NAME="283"></A>Essence, Quantity, Quality, Relation, Place, Time, Position, State, Activity, 
<A NAME="284"></A>Passivity. For the accident and genus and property and definition of anything 
<A NAME="285"></A>will always be in one of these categories: for all the propositions found 
<A NAME="286"></A>through these signify either something's essence or its quality or quantity 
<A NAME="287"></A>or some one of the other types of predicate. It is clear, too, on the face 
<A NAME="288"></A>of it that the man who signifies something's essence signifies sometimes 
<A NAME="289"></A>a substance, sometimes a quality, sometimes some one of the other types 
<A NAME="290"></A>of predicate. For when man is set before him and he says that what is set 
<A NAME="291"></A>there is 'a man' or 'an animal', he states its essence and signifies a 
<A NAME="292"></A>substance; but when a white colour is set before him and he says that what 
<A NAME="293"></A>is set there is 'white' or is 'a colour', he states its essence and signifies 
<A NAME="294"></A>a quality. Likewise, also, if a magnitude of a cubit be set before him 
<A NAME="295"></A>and he says that what is set there is a magnitude of a cubit, he will be 
<A NAME="296"></A>describing its essence and signifying a quantity. Likewise, also, in the 
<A NAME="297"></A>other cases: for each of these kinds of predicate, if either it be asserted 
<A NAME="298"></A>of itself, or its genus be asserted of it, signifies an essence: if, on 
<A NAME="299"></A>the other hand, one kind of predicate is asserted of another kind, it does 
<A NAME="300"></A>not signify an essence, but a quantity or a quality or one of the other 
<A NAME="301"></A>kinds of predicate. Such, then, and so many, are the subjects on which 
<A NAME="302"></A>arguments take place, and the materials with which they start. How we are 
<A NAME="303"></A>to acquire them, and by what means we are to become well supplied with 
<A NAME="304"></A>them, falls next to be told.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="305"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>First, then, a definition must be given of a 'dialectical proposition' 
<A NAME="307"></A>and a 'dialectical problem'. For it is not every proposition nor yet every 
<A NAME="308"></A>problem that is to be set down as dialectical: for no one in his senses 
<A NAME="309"></A>would make a proposition of what no one holds, nor yet make a problem of 
<A NAME="310"></A>what is obvious to everybody or to most people: for the latter admits of 
<A NAME="311"></A>no doubt, while to the former no one would assent. Now a dialectical proposition 
<A NAME="312"></A>consists in asking something that is held by all men or by most men or 
<A NAME="313"></A>by the philosophers, i.e. either by all, or by most, or by the most notable 
<A NAME="314"></A>of these, provided it be not contrary to the general opinion; for a man 
<A NAME="315"></A>would probably assent to the view of the philosophers, if it be not contrary 
<A NAME="316"></A>to the opinions of most men. Dialectical propositions also include views 
<A NAME="317"></A>which are like those generally accepted; also propositions which contradict 
<A NAME="318"></A>the contraries of opinions that are taken to be generally accepted, and 
<A NAME="319"></A>also all opinions that are in accordance with the recognized arts. Thus, 
<A NAME="320"></A>supposing it to be a general opinion that the knowledge of contraries is 
<A NAME="321"></A>the same, it might probably pass for a general opinion also that the perception 
<A NAME="322"></A>of contraries is the same: also, supposing it to be a general opinion that 
<A NAME="323"></A>there is but one single science of grammar, it might pass for a general 
<A NAME="324"></A>opinion that there is but one science of flute-playing as well, whereas, 
<A NAME="325"></A>if it be a general opinion that there is more than one science of grammar, 
<A NAME="326"></A>it might pass for a general opinion that there is more than one science 
<A NAME="327"></A>of flute-playing as well: for all these seem to be alike and akin. Likewise, 
<A NAME="328"></A>also, propositions contradicting the contraries of general opinions will 
<A NAME="329"></A>pass as general opinions: for if it be a general opinion that one ought 
<A NAME="330"></A>to do good to one's friends, it will also be a general opinion that one 
<A NAME="331"></A>ought not to do them harm. Here, that one ought to do harm to one's friends 
<A NAME="332"></A>is contrary to the general view, and that one ought not to do them harm 
<A NAME="333"></A>is the contradictory of that contrary. Likewise also, if one ought to do 
<A NAME="334"></A>good to one's friends, one ought not to do good to one's enemies: this 
<A NAME="335"></A>too is the contradictory of the view contrary to the general view; the 
<A NAME="336"></A>contrary being that one ought to do good to one's enemies. Likewise, also, 
<A NAME="337"></A>in other cases. Also, on comparison, it will look like a general opinion 
<A NAME="338"></A>that the contrary predicate belongs to the contrary subject: e.g. if one 
<A NAME="339"></A>ought to do good to one's friends, one ought also to do evil to one's enemies. 
<A NAME="340"></A>it might appear also as if doing good to one's friends were a contrary 
<A NAME="341"></A>to doing evil to one's enemies: but whether this is or is not so in reality 
<A NAME="342"></A>as well will be stated in the course of the discussion upon contraries. 
<A NAME="343"></A>Clearly also, all opinions that are in accordance with the arts are dialectical 
<A NAME="344"></A>propositions; for people are likely to assent to the views held by those 
<A NAME="345"></A>who have made a study of these things, e.g. on a question of medicine they 
<A NAME="346"></A>will agree with the doctor, and on a question of geometry with the geometrician; 
<A NAME="347"></A>and likewise also in other cases.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="348"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>A dialectical problem is a subject of inquiry that contributes 
<A NAME="350"></A>either to choice and avoidance, or to truth and knowledge, and that either 
<A NAME="351"></A>by itself, or as a help to the solution of some other such problem. It 
<A NAME="352"></A>must, moreover, be something on which either people hold no opinion either 
<A NAME="353"></A>way, or the masses hold a contrary opinion to the philosophers, or the 
<A NAME="354"></A>philosophers to the masses, or each of them among themselves. For some 
<A NAME="355"></A>problems it is useful to know with a view to choice or avoidance, e.g. 
<A NAME="356"></A>whether pleasure is to be chosen or not, while some it is useful to know 
<A NAME="357"></A>merely with a view to knowledge, e.g. whether the universe is eternal or 
<A NAME="358"></A>not: others, again, are not useful in and by themselves for either of these 
<A NAME="359"></A>purposes, but yet help us in regard to some such problems; for there are 
<A NAME="360"></A>many things which we do not wish to know in and by themselves, but for 
<A NAME="361"></A>the sake of other things, in order that through them we may come to know 
<A NAME="362"></A>something else. Problems also include questions in regard to which reasonings 
<A NAME="363"></A>conflict (the difficulty then being whether so-and so is so or not, there 
<A NAME="364"></A>being convincing arguments for both views); others also in regard to which 
<A NAME="365"></A>we have no argument because they are so vast, and we find it difficult 
<A NAME="366"></A>to give our reasons, e.g. the question whether the universe is eternal 
<A NAME="367"></A>or no: for into questions of that kind too it is possible to 
<A NAME="368"></A>inquire.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>Problems, then, and propositions are to be defined as aforesaid. 
<A NAME="370"></A>A 'thesis' is a supposition of some eminent philosopher that conflicts 
<A NAME="371"></A>with the general opinion; e.g. the view that contradiction is impossible, 
<A NAME="372"></A>as Antisthenes said; or the view of Heraclitus that all things are in motion; 
<A NAME="373"></A>or that Being is one, as Melissus says: for to take notice when any ordinary 
<A NAME="374"></A>person expresses views contrary to men's usual opinions would be silly. 
<A NAME="375"></A>Or it may be a view about which we have a reasoned theory contrary to men's 
<A NAME="376"></A>usual opinions, e.g. the view maintained by the sophists that what is need 
<A NAME="377"></A>not in every case either have come to be or be eternal: for a musician 
<A NAME="378"></A>who is a grammarian 'is' so without ever having 'come to be' so, or being 
<A NAME="379"></A>so eternally. For even if a man does not accept this view, he might do 
<A NAME="380"></A>so on the ground that it is reasonable.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>Now a 'thesis' also is a problem, though a problem is not always 
<A NAME="382"></A>a thesis, inasmuch as some problems are such that we have no opinion about 
<A NAME="383"></A>them either way. That a thesis, however, also forms a problem, is clear: 
<A NAME="384"></A>for it follows of necessity from what has been said that either the mass 
<A NAME="385"></A>of men disagree with the philosophers about the thesis, or that the one 
<A NAME="386"></A>or the other class disagree among themselves, seeing that the thesis is 
<A NAME="387"></A>a supposition in conflict with general opinion. Practically all dialectical 
<A NAME="388"></A>problems indeed are now called 'theses'. But it should make no difference 
<A NAME="389"></A>whichever description is used; for our object in thus distinguishing them 
<A NAME="390"></A>has not been to create a terminology, but to recognize what differences 
<A NAME="391"></A>happen to be found between them.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>Not every problem, nor every thesis, should be examined, but only 
<A NAME="393"></A>one which might puzzle one of those who need argument, not punishment or 
<A NAME="394"></A>perception. For people who are puzzled to know whether one ought to honour 
<A NAME="395"></A>the gods and love one's parents or not need punishment, while those who 
<A NAME="396"></A>are puzzled to know whether snow is white or not need perception. The subjects 
<A NAME="397"></A>should not border too closely upon the sphere of demonstration, nor yet 
<A NAME="398"></A>be too far removed from it: for the former cases admit of no doubt, while 
<A NAME="399"></A>the latter involve difficulties too great for the art of the 
<A NAME="400"></A>trainer.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="401"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>Having drawn these definitions, we must distinguish how many species 
<A NAME="403"></A>there are of dialectical arguments. There is on the one hand Induction, 
<A NAME="404"></A>on the other Reasoning. Now what reasoning is has been said before: induction 
<A NAME="405"></A>is a passage from individuals to universals, e.g. the argument that supposing 
<A NAME="406"></A>the skilled pilot is the most effective, and likewise the skilled charioteer, 
<A NAME="407"></A>then in general the skilled man is the best at his particular task. Induction 
<A NAME="408"></A>is the more convincing and clear: it is more readily learnt by the use 
<A NAME="409"></A>of the senses, and is applicable generally to the mass of men, though reasoning 
<A NAME="410"></A>is more forcible and effective against contradictious 
<A NAME="411"></A>people.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="412"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>The classes, then, of things about which, and of things out of 
<A NAME="414"></A>which, arguments are constructed, are to be distinguished in the way we 
<A NAME="415"></A>have said before. The means whereby we are to become well supplied with 
<A NAME="416"></A>reasonings are four: (1) the securing of propositions; (2) the power to 
<A NAME="417"></A>distinguish in how many senses particular expression is used; (3) the discovery 
<A NAME="418"></A>of the differences of things; (4) the investigation of likeness. The last 
<A NAME="419"></A>three, as well, are in a certain sense propositions: for it is possible 
<A NAME="420"></A>to make a proposition corresponding to each of them, e.g. (1) 'The desirable 
<A NAME="421"></A>may mean either the honourable or the pleasant or the expedient'; and (2) 
<A NAME="422"></A>Sensation differs from knowledge in that the latter may be recovered again 
<A NAME="423"></A>after it has been lost, while the former cannot'; and (3) The relation 
<A NAME="424"></A>of the healthy to health is like that of the vigorous to vigour'. The first 
<A NAME="425"></A>proposition depends upon the use of one term in several senses, the second 
<A NAME="426"></A>upon the differences of things, the third upon their 
<A NAME="427"></A>likenesses.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="428"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>Propositions should be selected in a number of ways corresponding 
<A NAME="430"></A>to the number of distinctions drawn in regard to the proposition: thus 
<A NAME="431"></A>one may first take in hand the opinions held by all or by most men or by 
<A NAME="432"></A>the philosophers, i.e. by all, or most, or the most notable of them; or 
<A NAME="433"></A>opinions contrary to those that seem to be generally held; and, again, 
<A NAME="434"></A>all opinions that are in accordance with the arts. We must make propositions 
<A NAME="435"></A>also of the contradictories of opinions contrary to those that seem to 
<A NAME="436"></A>be generally held, as was laid down before. It is useful also to make them 
<A NAME="437"></A>by selecting not only those opinions that actually are accepted, but also 
<A NAME="438"></A>those that are like these, e.g. 'The perception of contraries is the same'-the 
<A NAME="439"></A>knowledge of them being so-and 'we see by admission of something into ourselves, 
<A NAME="440"></A>not by an emission'; for so it is, too, in the case of the other senses; 
<A NAME="441"></A>for in hearing we admit something into ourselves; we do not emit; and we 
<A NAME="442"></A>taste in the same way. Likewise also in the other cases. Moreover, all 
<A NAME="443"></A>statements that seem to be true in all or in most cases, should be taken 
<A NAME="444"></A>as a principle or accepted position; for they are posited by those who 
<A NAME="445"></A>do not also see what exception there may be. We should select also from 
<A NAME="446"></A>the written handbooks of argument, and should draw up sketch-lists of them 
<A NAME="447"></A>upon each several kind of subject, putting them down under separate headings, 
<A NAME="448"></A>e.g. 'On Good', or 'On Life'-and that 'On Good' should deal with every 
<A NAME="449"></A>form of good, beginning with the category of essence. In the margin, too, 
<A NAME="450"></A>one should indicate also the opinions of individual thinkers, e.g. 'Empedocles 
<A NAME="451"></A>said that the elements of bodies were four': for any one might assent to 
<A NAME="452"></A>the saying of some generally accepted authority.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR>Of propositions and problems there are-to comprehend the matter 
<A NAME="454"></A>in outline-three divisions: for some are ethical propositions, some are 
<A NAME="455"></A>on natural philosophy, while some are logical. Propositions such as the 
<A NAME="456"></A>following are ethical, e.g. 'Ought one rather to obey one's parents or 
<A NAME="457"></A>the laws, if they disagree?'; such as this are logical, e.g. 'Is the knowledge 
<A NAME="458"></A>of opposites the same or not?'; while such as this are on natural philosophy, 
<A NAME="459"></A>e.g. 'Is the universe eternal or not?' Likewise also with problems. The 
<A NAME="460"></A>nature of each of the aforesaid kinds of proposition is not easily rendered 
<A NAME="461"></A>in a definition, but we have to try to recognize each of them by means 
<A NAME="462"></A>of the familiarity attained through induction, examining them in the light 
<A NAME="463"></A>of the illustrations given above.
<A NAME="464"></A><BR><BR>For purposes of philosophy we must treat of these things according 
<A NAME="465"></A>to their truth, but for dialectic only with an eye to general opinion. 
<A NAME="466"></A>All propositions should be taken in their most universal form; then, the 
<A NAME="467"></A>one should be made into many. E.g. 'The knowledge of opposites is the same'; 
<A NAME="468"></A>next, 'The knowledge of contraries is the same', and that 'of relative 
<A NAME="469"></A>terms'. In the same way these two should again be divided, as long as division 
<A NAME="470"></A>is possible, e.g. the knowledge of 'good and evil', of 'white and black', 
<A NAME="471"></A>or 'cold and hot'. Likewise also in other cases.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="472"></A><B>Part 15</B>

<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>On the formation, then, of propositions, the above remarks are 
<A NAME="474"></A>enough. As regards the number of senses a term bears, we must not only 
<A NAME="475"></A>treat of those terms which bear different senses, but we must also try 
<A NAME="476"></A>to render their definitions; e.g. we must not merely say that justice and 
<A NAME="477"></A>courage are called 'good' in one sense, and that what conduces to vigour 
<A NAME="478"></A>and what conduces to health are called so in another, but also that the 
<A NAME="479"></A>former are so called because of a certain intrinsic quality they themselves 
<A NAME="480"></A>have, the latter because they are productive of a certain result and not 
<A NAME="481"></A>because of any intrinsic quality in themselves. Similarly also in other 
<A NAME="482"></A>cases.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>Whether a term bears a number of specific meanings or one only, 
<A NAME="484"></A>may be considered by the following means. First, look and see if its contrary 
<A NAME="485"></A>bears a number of meanings, whether the discrepancy between them be one 
<A NAME="486"></A>of kind or one of names. For in some cases a difference is at once displayed 
<A NAME="487"></A>even in the names; e.g. the contrary of 'sharp' in the case of a note is 
<A NAME="488"></A>'flat', while in the case of a solid edge it is 'dull'. Clearly, then, 
<A NAME="489"></A>the contrary of 'sharp' bears several meanings, and if so, also does 'sharp'; 
<A NAME="490"></A>for corresponding to each of the former terms the meaning of its contrary 
<A NAME="491"></A>will be different. For 'sharp' will not be the same when contrary to 'dull' 
<A NAME="492"></A>and to 'flat', though 'sharp' is the contrary of each. Again Barhu ('flat', 
<A NAME="493"></A>'heavy') in the case of a note has 'sharp' as its contrary, but in the 
<A NAME="494"></A>case of a solid mass 'light', so that Barhu is used with a number of meanings, 
<A NAME="495"></A>inasmuch as its contrary also is so used. Likewise, also, 'fine' as applied 
<A NAME="496"></A>to a picture has 'ugly' as its contrary, but, as applied to a house, 'ramshackle'; 
<A NAME="497"></A>so that 'fine' is an ambiguous term.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><BR>In some cases there is no discrepancy of any sort in the names 
<A NAME="499"></A>used, but a difference of kind between the meanings is at once obvious: 
<A NAME="500"></A>e.g. in the case of 'clear' and 'obscure': for sound is called 'clear' 
<A NAME="501"></A>and 'obscure', just as 'colour' is too. As regards the names, then, there 
<A NAME="502"></A>is no discrepancy, but the difference in kind between the meanings is at 
<A NAME="503"></A>once obvious: for colour is not called 'clear' in a like sense to sound. 
<A NAME="504"></A>This is plain also through sensation: for of things that are the same in 
<A NAME="505"></A>kind we have the same sensation, whereas we do not judge clearness by the 
<A NAME="506"></A>same sensation in the case of sound and of colour, but in the latter case 
<A NAME="507"></A>we judge by sight, in the former by hearing. Likewise also with 'sharp' 
<A NAME="508"></A>and 'dull' in regard to flavours and solid edges: here in the latter case 
<A NAME="509"></A>we judge by touch, but in the former by taste. For here again there is 
<A NAME="510"></A>no discrepancy in the names used, in the case either of the original terms 
<A NAME="511"></A>or of their contraries: for the contrary also of sharp in either sense 
<A NAME="512"></A>is 'dull'.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see if one sense of a term has a contrary, while another 
<A NAME="514"></A>has absolutely none; e.g. the pleasure of drinking has a contrary in the 
<A NAME="515"></A>pain of thirst, whereas the pleasure of seeing that the diagonal is incommensurate 
<A NAME="516"></A>with the side has none, so that 'pleasure' is used in more than one sense. 
<A NAME="517"></A>To 'love' also, used of the frame of mind, has to 'hate' as its contrary, 
<A NAME="518"></A>while as used of the physical activity (kissing) it has none: clearly, 
<A NAME="519"></A>therefore, to 'love' is an ambiguous term. Further, see in regard to their 
<A NAME="520"></A>intermediates, if some meanings and their contraries have an intermediate, 
<A NAME="521"></A>others have none, or if both have one but not the same one, e.g. 'clear' 
<A NAME="522"></A>and 'obscure' in the case of colours have 'grey' as an intermediate, whereas 
<A NAME="523"></A>in the case of sound they have none, or, if they have, it is 'harsh', as 
<A NAME="524"></A>some people say that a harsh sound is intermediate. 'Clear', then, is an 
<A NAME="525"></A>ambiguous term, and likewise also 'obscure'. See, moreover, if some of 
<A NAME="526"></A>them have more than one intermediate, while others have but one, as is 
<A NAME="527"></A>the case with 'clear' and 'obscure', for in the case of colours there are 
<A NAME="528"></A>numbers of intermediates, whereas in regard to sound there is but one, 
<A NAME="529"></A>viz. 'harsh'.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>Again, in the case of the contradictory opposite, look and see 
<A NAME="531"></A>if it bears more than one meaning. For if this bears more than one meaning, 
<A NAME="532"></A>then the opposite of it also will be used in more than one meaning; e.g. 
<A NAME="533"></A>'to fail to see' a phrase with more than one meaning, viz. (1) to fail 
<A NAME="534"></A>to possess the power of sight, (2) to fail to put that power to active 
<A NAME="535"></A>use. But if this has more than one meaning, it follows necessarily that 
<A NAME="536"></A>'to see' also has more than one meaning: for there will be an opposite 
<A NAME="537"></A>to each sense of 'to fail to see'; e.g. the opposite of 'not to possess 
<A NAME="538"></A>the power of sight' is to possess it, while of 'not to put the power of 
<A NAME="539"></A>sight to active use', the opposite is to put it to active 
<A NAME="540"></A>use.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, examine the case of terms that denote the privation or 
<A NAME="542"></A>presence of a certain state: for if the one term bears more than one meaning, 
<A NAME="543"></A>then so will the remaining term: e.g. if 'to have sense' be used with more 
<A NAME="544"></A>than one meaning, as applied to the soul and to the body, then 'to be wanting 
<A NAME="545"></A>in sense' too will be used with more than one meaning, as applied to the 
<A NAME="546"></A>soul and to the body. That the opposition between the terms now in question 
<A NAME="547"></A>depends upon the privation or presence of a certain state is clear, since 
<A NAME="548"></A>animals naturally possess each kind of 'sense', both as applied to the 
<A NAME="549"></A>soul and as applied to the body.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, examine the inflected forms. For if 'justly' has more 
<A NAME="551"></A>than one meaning, then 'just', also, will be used with more than one meaning; 
<A NAME="552"></A>for there will be a meaning of 'just' to each of the meanings of 'justly'; 
<A NAME="553"></A>e.g. if the word 'justly' be used of judging according to one's own opinion, 
<A NAME="554"></A>and also of judging as one ought, then 'just' also will be used in like 
<A NAME="555"></A>manner. In the same way also, if 'healthy' has more than one meaning, then 
<A NAME="556"></A>'healthily' also will be used with more than one meaning: e.g. if 'healthy' 
<A NAME="557"></A>describes both what produces health and what preserves health and what 
<A NAME="558"></A>betokens health, then 'healthily' also will be used to mean 'in such a 
<A NAME="559"></A>way as to produce' or 'preserve' or 'betoken' health. Likewise also in 
<A NAME="560"></A>other cases, whenever the original term bears more than one meaning, the 
<A NAME="561"></A>inflexion also that is formed from it will be used with more than one meaning, 
<A NAME="562"></A>and vice versa.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>Look also at the classes of the predicates signified by the term, 
<A NAME="564"></A>and see if they are the same in all cases. For if they are not the same, 
<A NAME="565"></A>then clearly the term is ambiguous: e.g. 'good' in the case of food means 
<A NAME="566"></A>'productive of pleasure', and in the case of medicine 'productive of health', 
<A NAME="567"></A>whereas as applied to the soul it means to be of a certain quality, e.g. 
<A NAME="568"></A>temperate or courageous or just: and likewise also, as applied to 'man'. 
<A NAME="569"></A>Sometimes it signifies what happens at a certain time, as (e.g.) the good 
<A NAME="570"></A>that happens at the right time: for what happens at the right time is called 
<A NAME="571"></A>good. Often it signifies what is of certain quantity, e.g. as applied to 
<A NAME="572"></A>the proper amount: for the proper amount too is called good. So then the 
<A NAME="573"></A>term 'good' is ambiguous. In the same way also 'clear', as applied to a 
<A NAME="574"></A>body, signifies a colour, but in regard to a note it denotes what is 'easy 
<A NAME="575"></A>to hear'. 'Sharp', too, is in a closely similar case: for the same term 
<A NAME="576"></A>does not bear the same meaning in all its applications: for a sharp note 
<A NAME="577"></A>is a swift note, as the mathematical theorists of harmony tell us, whereas 
<A NAME="578"></A>a sharp (acute) angle is one that is less than a right angle, while a sharp 
<A NAME="579"></A>dagger is one containing a sharp angle (point).
<A NAME="580"></A><BR><BR>Look also at the genera of the objects denoted by the same term, 
<A NAME="581"></A>and see if they are different without being subaltern, as (e.g.) 'donkey', 
<A NAME="582"></A>which denotes both the animal and the engine. For the definition of them 
<A NAME="583"></A>that corresponds to the name is different: for the one will be declared 
<A NAME="584"></A>to be an animal of a certain kind, and the other to be an engine of a certain 
<A NAME="585"></A>kind. If, however, the genera be subaltern, there is no necessity for the 
<A NAME="586"></A>definitions to be different. Thus (e.g.) 'animal' is the genus of 'raven', 
<A NAME="587"></A>and so is 'bird'. Whenever therefore we say that the raven is a bird, we 
<A NAME="588"></A>also say that it is a certain kind of animal, so that both the genera are 
<A NAME="589"></A>predicated of it. Likewise also whenever we call the raven a 'flying biped 
<A NAME="590"></A>animal', we declare it to be a bird: in this way, then, as well, both the 
<A NAME="591"></A>genera are predicated of raven, and also their definition. But in the case 
<A NAME="592"></A>of genera that are not subaltern this does not happen, for whenever we 
<A NAME="593"></A>call a thing an 'engine', we do not call it an animal, nor vice 
<A NAME="594"></A>versa.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>Look also and see not only if the genera of the term before you 
<A NAME="596"></A>are different without being subaltern, but also in the case of its contrary: 
<A NAME="597"></A>for if its contrary bears several senses, clearly the term before you does 
<A NAME="598"></A>so as well.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>It is useful also to look at the definition that arises from the 
<A NAME="600"></A>use of the term in combination, e.g. of a 'clear (lit. white) body' of 
<A NAME="601"></A>a 'clear note'. For then if what is peculiar in each case be abstracted, 
<A NAME="602"></A>the same expression ought to remain over. This does not happen in the case 
<A NAME="603"></A>of ambiguous terms, e.g. in the cases just mentioned. For the former will 
<A NAME="604"></A>be body possessing such and such a colour', while the latter will be 'a 
<A NAME="605"></A>note easy to hear'. Abstract, then, 'a body 'and' a note', and the remainder 
<A NAME="606"></A>in each case is not the same. It should, however, have been had the meaning 
<A NAME="607"></A>of 'clear' in each case been synonymous.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>Often in the actual definitions as well ambiguity creeps in unawares, 
<A NAME="609"></A>and for this reason the definitions also should be examined. If (e.g.) 
<A NAME="610"></A>any one describes what betokens and what produces health as 'related commensurably 
<A NAME="611"></A>to health', we must not desist but go on to examine in what sense he has 
<A NAME="612"></A>used the term 'commensurably' in each case, e.g. if in the latter case 
<A NAME="613"></A>it means that 'it is of the right amount to produce health', whereas in 
<A NAME="614"></A>the for it means that 'it is such as to betoken what kind of state 
<A NAME="615"></A>prevails'.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see if the terms cannot be compared as 'more or less' 
<A NAME="617"></A>or as 'in like manner', as is the case (e.g.) with a 'clear' (lit. white) 
<A NAME="618"></A>sound and a 'clear' garment, and a 'sharp' flavour and a 'sharp' note. 
<A NAME="619"></A>For neither are these things said to be clear or sharp 'in a like degree', 
<A NAME="620"></A>nor yet is the one said to be clearer or sharper than the other. 'Clear', 
<A NAME="621"></A>then, and 'sharp' are ambiguous. For synonyms are always comparable; for 
<A NAME="622"></A>they will always be used either in like manner, or else in a greater degree 
<A NAME="623"></A>in one case.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>Now since of genera that are different without being subaltern 
<A NAME="625"></A>the differentiae also are different in kind, e.g. those of 'animal' and 
<A NAME="626"></A>'knowledge' (for the differentiae of these are different), look and see 
<A NAME="627"></A>if the meanings comprised under the same term are differentiae of genera 
<A NAME="628"></A>that are different without being subaltern, as e.g. 'sharp' is of a 'note' 
<A NAME="629"></A>and a 'solid'. For being 'sharp' differentiates note from note, and likewise 
<A NAME="630"></A>also one solid from another. 'Sharp', then, is an ambiguous term: for it 
<A NAME="631"></A>forms differentiae of genera that are different without being 
<A NAME="632"></A>subaltern.
<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>Again, see if the actual meanings included under the same term 
<A NAME="634"></A>themselves have different differentiae, e.g. 'colour' in bodies and 'colour' 
<A NAME="635"></A>in tunes: for the differentiae of 'colour' in bodies are 'sight-piercing' 
<A NAME="636"></A>and 'sight compressing', whereas 'colour' in melodies has not the same 
<A NAME="637"></A>differentiae. Colour, then, is an ambiguous term; for things that are the 
<A NAME="638"></A>same have the same differentiae.
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, since the species is never the differentia of anything, 
<A NAME="640"></A>look and see if one of the meanings included under the same term be a species 
<A NAME="641"></A>and another a differentia, as (e.g.) clear' (lit. white) as applied to 
<A NAME="642"></A>a body is a species of colour, whereas in the case of a note it is a differentia; 
<A NAME="643"></A>for one note is differentiated from another by being 
<A NAME="644"></A>'clear'.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="645"></A><B>Part 16</B>

<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>The presence, then, of a number of meanings in a term may be investigated 
<A NAME="647"></A>by these and like means. The differences which things present to each other 
<A NAME="648"></A>should be examined within the same genera, e.g. 'Wherein does justice differ 
<A NAME="649"></A>from courage, and wisdom from temperance?'-for all these belong to the 
<A NAME="650"></A>same genus; and also from one genus to another, provided they be not very 
<A NAME="651"></A>much too far apart, e.g. 'Wherein does sensation differ from knowledge?: 
<A NAME="652"></A>for in the case of genera that are very far apart, the differences are 
<A NAME="653"></A>entirely obvious.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="654"></A><B>Part 17</B>

<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>Likeness should be studied, first, in the case of things belonging 
<A NAME="656"></A>to different genera, the formulae being 'A:B = C:D' (e.g. as knowledge 
<A NAME="657"></A>stands to the object of knowledge, so is sensation related to the object 
<A NAME="658"></A>of sensation), and 'As A is in B, so is C in D' (e.g. as sight is in the 
<A NAME="659"></A>eye, so is reason in the soul, and as is a calm in the sea, so is windlessness 
<A NAME="660"></A>in the air). Practice is more especially needed in regard to terms that 
<A NAME="661"></A>are far apart; for in the case of the rest, we shall be more easily able 
<A NAME="662"></A>to see in one glance the points of likeness. We should also look at things 
<A NAME="663"></A>which belong to the same genus, to see if any identical attribute belongs 
<A NAME="664"></A>to them all, e.g. to a man and a horse and a dog; for in so far as they 
<A NAME="665"></A>have any identical attribute, in so far they are alike.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="666"></A><B>Part 18</B>

<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>It is useful to have examined the number of meanings of a term 
<A NAME="668"></A>both for clearness' sake (for a man is more likely to know what it is he 
<A NAME="669"></A>asserts, if it bas been made clear to him how many meanings it may have), 
<A NAME="670"></A>and also with a view to ensuring that our reasonings shall be in accordance 
<A NAME="671"></A>with the actual facts and not addressed merely to the term used. For as 
<A NAME="672"></A>long as it is not clear in how many senses a term is used, it is possible 
<A NAME="673"></A>that the answerer and the questioner are not directing their minds upon 
<A NAME="674"></A>the same thing: whereas when once it has been made clear how many meanings 
<A NAME="675"></A>there are, and also upon which of them the former directs his mind when 
<A NAME="676"></A>he makes his assertion, the questioner would then look ridiculous if he 
<A NAME="677"></A>failed to address his argument to this. It helps us also both to avoid 
<A NAME="678"></A>being misled and to mislead by false reasoning: for if we know the number 
<A NAME="679"></A>of meanings of a term, we shall certainly never be misled by false reasoning, 
<A NAME="680"></A>but shall know if the questioner fails to address his argument to the same 
<A NAME="681"></A>point; and when we ourselves put the questions we shall be able to mislead 
<A NAME="682"></A>him, if our answerer happens not to know the number of meanings of our 
<A NAME="683"></A>terms. This, however, is not possible in all cases, but only when of the 
<A NAME="684"></A>many senses some are true and others are false. This manner of argument, 
<A NAME="685"></A>however, does not belong properly to dialectic; dialecticians should therefore 
<A NAME="686"></A>by all means beware of this kind of verbal discussion, unless any one is 
<A NAME="687"></A>absolutely unable to discuss the subject before him in any other 
<A NAME="688"></A>way.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR><BR>The discovery of the differences of things helps us both in reasonings 
<A NAME="690"></A>about sameness and difference, and also in recognizing what any particular 
<A NAME="691"></A>thing is. That it helps us in reasoning about sameness and difference is 
<A NAME="692"></A>clear: for when we have discovered a difference of any kind whatever between 
<A NAME="693"></A>the objects before us, we shall already have shown that they are not the 
<A NAME="694"></A>same: while it helps us in recognizing what a thing is, because we usually 
<A NAME="695"></A>distinguish the expression that is proper to the essence of each particular 
<A NAME="696"></A>thing by means of the differentiae that are proper to 
<A NAME="697"></A>it.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR><BR>The examination of likeness is useful with a view both to inductive 
<A NAME="699"></A>arguments and to hypothetical reasonings, and also with a view to the rendering 
<A NAME="700"></A>of definitions. It is useful for inductive arguments, because it is by 
<A NAME="701"></A>means of an induction of individuals in cases that are alike that we claim 
<A NAME="702"></A>to bring the universal in evidence: for it is not easy to do this if we 
<A NAME="703"></A>do not know the points of likeness. It is useful for hypothetical reasonings 
<A NAME="704"></A>because it is a general opinion that among similars what is true of one 
<A NAME="705"></A>is true also of the rest. If, then, with regard to any of them we are well 
<A NAME="706"></A>supplied with matter for a discussion, we shall secure a preliminary admission 
<A NAME="707"></A>that however it is in these cases, so it is also in the case before us: 
<A NAME="708"></A>then when we have shown the former we shall have shown, on the strength 
<A NAME="709"></A>of the hypothesis, the matter before us as well: for we have first made 
<A NAME="710"></A>the hypothesis that however it is in these cases, so it is also in the 
<A NAME="711"></A>case before us, and have then proved the point as regards these cases. 
<A NAME="712"></A>It is useful for the rendering of definitions because, if we are able to 
<A NAME="713"></A>see in one glance what is the same in each individual case of it, we shall 
<A NAME="714"></A>be at no loss into what genus we ought to put the object before us when 
<A NAME="715"></A>we define it: for of the common predicates that which is most definitely 
<A NAME="716"></A>in the category of essence is likely to be the genus. Likewise, also, in 
<A NAME="717"></A>the case of objects widely divergent, the examination of likeness is useful 
<A NAME="718"></A>for purposes of definition, e.g. the sameness of a calm at sea, and windlessness 
<A NAME="719"></A>in the air (each being a form of rest), and of a point on a line and the 
<A NAME="720"></A>unit in number-each being a starting point. If, then, we render as the 
<A NAME="721"></A>genus what is common to all the cases, we shall get the credit of defining 
<A NAME="722"></A>not inappropriately. Definition-mongers too nearly always render them in 
<A NAME="723"></A>this way: they declare the unit to be the startingpoint of number, and 
<A NAME="724"></A>the point the startingpoint of a line. It is clear, then, that they place 
<A NAME="725"></A>them in that which is common to both as their genus.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><BR>The means, then, whereby reasonings are effected, are these: the 
<A NAME="727"></A>commonplace rules, for the observance of which the aforesaid means are 
<A NAME="728"></A>useful, are as follows.
