<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Nature has been defined as a 'principle of motion and change', and it is 
<A NAME="12"></A>the subject of our inquiry. We must therefore see that we understand the 
<A NAME="13"></A>meaning of 'motion'; for if it were unknown, the meaning of 'nature' too 
<A NAME="14"></A>would be unknown.
<A NAME="15"></A><BR><BR>When we have determined the nature of motion, our next task will 
<A NAME="16"></A>be to attack in the same way the terms which are involved in it. Now motion 
<A NAME="17"></A>is supposed to belong to the class of things which are continuous; and 
<A NAME="18"></A>the infinite presents itself first in the continuous-that is how it comes 
<A NAME="19"></A>about that 'infinite' is often used in definitions of the continuous ('what 
<A NAME="20"></A>is infinitely divisible is continuous'). Besides these, place, void, and 
<A NAME="21"></A>time are thought to be necessary conditions of motion.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>Clearly, then, for these reasons and also because the attributes 
<A NAME="23"></A>mentioned are common to, and coextensive with, all the objects of our science, 
<A NAME="24"></A>we must first take each of them in hand and discuss it. For the investigation 
<A NAME="25"></A>of special attributes comes after that of the common 
<A NAME="26"></A>attributes.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>To begin then, as we said, with motion.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>We may start by distinguishing (1) what exists in a state of fulfilment 
<A NAME="29"></A>only, (2) what exists as potential, (3) what exists as potential and also 
<A NAME="30"></A>in fulfilment-one being a 'this', another 'so much', a third 'such', and 
<A NAME="31"></A>similarly in each of the other modes of the predication of 
<A NAME="32"></A>being.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>Further, the word 'relative' is used with reference to (1) excess 
<A NAME="34"></A>and defect, (2) agent and patient and generally what can move and what 
<A NAME="35"></A>can be moved. For 'what can cause movement' is relative to 'what can be 
<A NAME="36"></A>moved', and vice versa.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>Again, there is no such thing as motion over and above the things. 
<A NAME="38"></A>It is always with respect to substance or to quantity or to quality or 
<A NAME="39"></A>to place that what changes changes. But it is impossible, as we assert, 
<A NAME="40"></A>to find anything common to these which is neither 'this' nor quantum nor 
<A NAME="41"></A>quale nor any of the other predicates. Hence neither will motion and change 
<A NAME="42"></A>have reference to something over and above the things mentioned, for there 
<A NAME="43"></A>is nothing over and above them.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>Now each of these belongs to all its subjects in either of two 
<A NAME="45"></A>ways: namely (1) substance-the one is positive form, the other privation; 
<A NAME="46"></A>(2) in quality, white and black; (3) in quantity, complete and incomplete; 
<A NAME="47"></A>(4) in respect of locomotion, upwards and downwards or light and heavy. 
<A NAME="48"></A>Hence there are as many types of motion or change as there are meanings 
<A NAME="49"></A>of the word 'is'.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>We have now before us the distinctions in the various classes of 
<A NAME="51"></A>being between what is full real and what is potential.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR><B>Def.</B> The fulfilment of what exists potentially, in so far 
<A NAME="53"></A>as it exists potentially, is motion-namely, of what is alterable qua alterable, 
<A NAME="54"></A>alteration: of what can be increased and its opposite what can be decreased 
<A NAME="55"></A>(there is no common name), increase and decrease: of what can come to be 
<A NAME="56"></A>and can pass away, coming to he and passing away: of what can be carried 
<A NAME="57"></A>along, locomotion.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>Examples will elucidate this definition of motion. When the buildable, 
<A NAME="59"></A>in so far as it is just that, is fully real, it is being built, and this 
<A NAME="60"></A>is building. Similarly, learning, doctoring, rolling, leaping, ripening, 
<A NAME="61"></A>ageing.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>The same thing, if it is of a certain kind, can be both potential 
<A NAME="63"></A>and fully real, not indeed at the same time or not in the same respect, 
<A NAME="64"></A>but e.g. potentially hot and actually cold. Hence at once such things will 
<A NAME="65"></A>act and be acted on by one another in many ways: each of them will be capable 
<A NAME="66"></A>at the same time of causing alteration and of being altered. Hence, too, 
<A NAME="67"></A>what effects motion as a physical agent can be moved: when a thing of this 
<A NAME="68"></A>kind causes motion, it is itself also moved. This, indeed, has led some 
<A NAME="69"></A>people to suppose that every mover is moved. But this question depends 
<A NAME="70"></A>on another set of arguments, and the truth will be made clear later. is 
<A NAME="71"></A>possible for a thing to cause motion, though it is itself incapable of 
<A NAME="72"></A>being moved.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>It is the fulfilment of what is potential when it is already fully 
<A NAME="74"></A>real and operates not as itself but as movable, that is motion. What I 
<A NAME="75"></A>mean by 'as' is this: Bronze is potentially a statue. But it is not the 
<A NAME="76"></A>fulfilment of bronze as bronze which is motion. For 'to be bronze' and 
<A NAME="77"></A>'to be a certain potentiality' are not the same.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>If they were identical without qualification, i.e. in definition, 
<A NAME="79"></A>the fulfilment of bronze as bronze would have been motion. But they are 
<A NAME="80"></A>not the same, as has been said. (This is obvious in contraries. 'To be 
<A NAME="81"></A>capable of health' and 'to be capable of illness' are not the same, for 
<A NAME="82"></A>if they were there would be no difference between being ill and being well. 
<A NAME="83"></A>Yet the subject both of health and of sickness-whether it is humour or 
<A NAME="84"></A>blood-is one and the same.)
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>We can distinguish, then, between the two-just as, to give another 
<A NAME="86"></A>example, 'colour' and visible' are different-and clearly it is the fulfilment 
<A NAME="87"></A>of what is potential as potential that is motion. So this, precisely, is 
<A NAME="88"></A>motion.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>Further it is evident that motion is an attribute of a thing just 
<A NAME="90"></A>when it is fully real in this way, and neither before nor after. For each 
<A NAME="91"></A>thing of this kind is capable of being at one time actual, at another not. 
<A NAME="92"></A>Take for instance the buildable as buildable. The actuality of the buildable 
<A NAME="93"></A>as buildable is the process of building. For the actuality of the buildable 
<A NAME="94"></A>must be either this or the house. But when there is a house, the buildable 
<A NAME="95"></A>is no longer buildable. On the other hand, it is the buildable which is 
<A NAME="96"></A>being built. The process then of being built must be the kind of actuality 
<A NAME="97"></A>required But building is a kind of motion, and the same account will apply 
<A NAME="98"></A>to the other kinds also.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="99"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>The soundness of this definition is evident both when we consider 
<A NAME="101"></A>the accounts of motion that the others have given, and also from the difficulty 
<A NAME="102"></A>of defining it otherwise.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>One could not easily put motion and change in another genus-this 
<A NAME="104"></A>is plain if we consider where some people put it; they identify motion 
<A NAME="105"></A>with or 'inequality' or 'not being'; but such things are not necessarily 
<A NAME="106"></A>moved, whether they are 'different' or 'unequal' or 'non-existent'; Nor 
<A NAME="107"></A>is change either to or from these rather than to or from their 
<A NAME="108"></A>opposites.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>The reason why they put motion into these genera is that it is 
<A NAME="110"></A>thought to be something indefinite, and the principles in the second column 
<A NAME="111"></A>are indefinite because they are privative: none of them is either 'this' 
<A NAME="112"></A>or 'such' or comes under any of the other modes of predication. The reason 
<A NAME="113"></A>in turn why motion is thought to be indefinite is that it cannot be classed 
<A NAME="114"></A>simply as a potentiality or as an actuality-a thing that is merely capable 
<A NAME="115"></A>of having a certain size is not undergoing change, nor yet a thing that 
<A NAME="116"></A>is actually of a certain size, and motion is thought to be a sort of actuality, 
<A NAME="117"></A>but incomplete, the reason for this view being that the potential whose 
<A NAME="118"></A>actuality it is is incomplete. This is why it is hard to grasp what motion 
<A NAME="119"></A>is. It is necessary to class it with privation or with potentiality or 
<A NAME="120"></A>with sheer actuality, yet none of these seems possible. There remains then 
<A NAME="121"></A>the suggested mode of definition, namely that it is a sort of actuality, 
<A NAME="122"></A>or actuality of the kind described, hard to grasp, but not incapable of 
<A NAME="123"></A>existing.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>The mover too is moved, as has been said-every mover, that is, 
<A NAME="125"></A>which is capable of motion, and whose immobility is rest-when a thing is 
<A NAME="126"></A>subject to motion its immobility is rest. For to act on the movable as 
<A NAME="127"></A>such is just to move it. But this it does by contact, so that at the same 
<A NAME="128"></A>time it is also acted on. Hence we can define motion as the fulfilment 
<A NAME="129"></A>of the movable qua movable, the cause of the attribute being contact with 
<A NAME="130"></A>what can move so that the mover is also acted on. The mover or agent will 
<A NAME="131"></A>always be the vehicle of a form, either a 'this' or 'such', which, when 
<A NAME="132"></A>it acts, will be the source and cause of the change, e.g. the full-formed 
<A NAME="133"></A>man begets man from what is potentially man.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="134"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>The solution of the difficulty that is raised about the motion-whether 
<A NAME="136"></A>it is in the movable-is plain. It is the fulfilment of this potentiality, 
<A NAME="137"></A>and by the action of that which has the power of causing motion; and the 
<A NAME="138"></A>actuality of that which has the power of causing motion is not other than 
<A NAME="139"></A>the actuality of the movable, for it must be the fulfilment of both. A 
<A NAME="140"></A>thing is capable of causing motion because it can do this, it is a mover 
<A NAME="141"></A>because it actually does it. But it is on the movable that it is capable 
<A NAME="142"></A>of acting. Hence there is a single actuality of both alike, just as one 
<A NAME="143"></A>to two and two to one are the same interval, and the steep ascent and the 
<A NAME="144"></A>steep descent are one-for these are one and the same, although they can 
<A NAME="145"></A>be described in different ways. So it is with the mover and the 
<A NAME="146"></A>moved.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>This view has a dialectical difficulty. Perhaps it is necessary 
<A NAME="148"></A>that the actuality of the agent and that of the patient should not be the 
<A NAME="149"></A>same. The one is 'agency' and the other 'patiency'; and the outcome and 
<A NAME="150"></A>completion of the one is an 'action', that of the other a 'passion'. Since 
<A NAME="151"></A>then they are both motions, we may ask: in what are they, if they are different? 
<A NAME="152"></A>Either (a) both are in what is acted on and moved, or (b) the agency is 
<A NAME="153"></A>in the agent and the patiency in the patient. (If we ought to call the 
<A NAME="154"></A>latter also 'agency', the word would be used in two 
<A NAME="155"></A>senses.)
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>Now, in alternative (b), the motion will be in the mover, for the 
<A NAME="157"></A>same statement will hold of 'mover' and 'moved'. Hence either every mover 
<A NAME="158"></A>will be moved, or, though having motion, it will not be 
<A NAME="159"></A>moved.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>If on the other hand (a) both are in what is moved and acted on-both 
<A NAME="161"></A>the agency and the patiency (e.g. both teaching and learning, though they 
<A NAME="162"></A>are two, in the learner), then, first, the actuality of each will not be 
<A NAME="163"></A>present in each, and, a second absurdity, a thing will have two motions 
<A NAME="164"></A>at the same time. How will there be two alterations of quality in one subject 
<A NAME="165"></A>towards one definite quality? The thing is impossible: the actualization 
<A NAME="166"></A>will be one.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>But (some one will say) it is contrary to reason to suppose that 
<A NAME="168"></A>there should be one identical actualization of two things which are different 
<A NAME="169"></A>in kind. Yet there will be, if teaching and learning are the same, and 
<A NAME="170"></A>agency and patiency. To teach will be the same as to learn, and to act 
<A NAME="171"></A>the same as to be acted on-the teacher will necessarily be learning everything 
<A NAME="172"></A>that he teaches, and the agent will be acted on. One may 
<A NAME="173"></A>reply:
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>(1) It is not absurd that the actualization of one thing should 
<A NAME="175"></A>be in another. Teaching is the activity of a person who can teach, yet 
<A NAME="176"></A>the operation is performed on some patient-it is not cut adrift from a 
<A NAME="177"></A>subject, but is of A on B.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>(2) There is nothing to prevent two things having one and the same 
<A NAME="179"></A>actualization, provided the actualizations are not described in the same 
<A NAME="180"></A>way, but are related as what can act to what is acting.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>(3) Nor is it necessary that the teacher should learn, even if 
<A NAME="182"></A>to act and to be acted on are one and the same, provided they are not the 
<A NAME="183"></A>same in definition (as 'raiment' and 'dress'), but are the same merely 
<A NAME="184"></A>in the sense in which the road from Thebes to Athens and the road from 
<A NAME="185"></A>Athens to Thebes are the same, as has been explained above. For it is not 
<A NAME="186"></A>things which are in a way the same that have all their attributes the same, 
<A NAME="187"></A>but only such as have the same definition. But indeed it by no means follows 
<A NAME="188"></A>from the fact that teaching is the same as learning, that to learn is the 
<A NAME="189"></A>same as to teach, any more than it follows from the fact that there is 
<A NAME="190"></A>one distance between two things which are at a distance from each other, 
<A NAME="191"></A>that the two vectors AB and Ba, are one and the same. To generalize, teaching 
<A NAME="192"></A>is not the same as learning, or agency as patiency, in the full sense, 
<A NAME="193"></A>though they belong to the same subject, the motion; for the 'actualization 
<A NAME="194"></A>of X in Y' and the 'actualization of Y through the action of X' differ 
<A NAME="195"></A>in definition.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>What then Motion is, has been stated both generally and particularly. 
<A NAME="197"></A>It is not difficult to see how each of its types will be defined-alteration 
<A NAME="198"></A>is the fulfillment of the alterable qua alterable (or, more scientifically, 
<A NAME="199"></A>the fulfilment of what can act and what can be acted on, as such)-generally 
<A NAME="200"></A>and again in each particular case, building, healing, &c. A similar definition 
<A NAME="201"></A>will apply to each of the other kinds of motion.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="202"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>The science of nature is concerned with spatial magnitudes and 
<A NAME="204"></A>motion and time, and each of these at least is necessarily infinite or 
<A NAME="205"></A>finite, even if some things dealt with by the science are not, e.g. a quality 
<A NAME="206"></A>or a point-it is not necessary perhaps that such things should be put under 
<A NAME="207"></A>either head. Hence it is incumbent on the person who specializes in physics 
<A NAME="208"></A>to discuss the infinite and to inquire whether there is such a thing or 
<A NAME="209"></A>not, and, if there is, what it is.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>The appropriateness to the science of this problem is clearly indicated. 
<A NAME="211"></A>All who have touched on this kind of science in a way worth considering 
<A NAME="212"></A>have formulated views about the infinite, and indeed, to a man, make it 
<A NAME="213"></A>a principle of things.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>(1) Some, as the Pythagoreans and Plato, make the infinite a principle 
<A NAME="215"></A>in the sense of a self-subsistent substance, and not as a mere attribute 
<A NAME="216"></A>of some other thing. Only the Pythagoreans place the infinite among the 
<A NAME="217"></A>objects of sense (they do not regard number as separable from these), and 
<A NAME="218"></A>assert that what is outside the heaven is infinite. Plato, on the other 
<A NAME="219"></A>hand, holds that there is no body outside (the Forms are not outside because 
<A NAME="220"></A>they are nowhere),yet that the infinite is present not only in the objects 
<A NAME="221"></A>of sense but in the Forms also.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>Further, the Pythagoreans identify the infinite with the even. 
<A NAME="223"></A>For this, they say, when it is cut off and shut in by the odd, provides 
<A NAME="224"></A>things with the element of infinity. An indication of this is what happens 
<A NAME="225"></A>with numbers. If the gnomons are placed round the one, and without the 
<A NAME="226"></A>one, in the one construction the figure that results is always different, 
<A NAME="227"></A>in the other it is always the same. But Plato has two infinites, the Great 
<A NAME="228"></A>and the Small.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>The physicists, on the other hand, all of them, always regard the 
<A NAME="230"></A>infinite as an attribute of a substance which is different from it and 
<A NAME="231"></A>belongs to the class of the so-called elements-water or air or what is 
<A NAME="232"></A>intermediate between them. Those who make them limited in number never 
<A NAME="233"></A>make them infinite in amount. But those who make the elements infinite 
<A NAME="234"></A>in number, as Anaxagoras and Democritus do, say that the infinite is continuous 
<A NAME="235"></A>by contact-compounded of the homogeneous parts according to the one, of 
<A NAME="236"></A>the seed-mass of the atomic shapes according to the 
<A NAME="237"></A>other.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>Further, Anaxagoras held that any part is a mixture in the same 
<A NAME="239"></A>way as the All, on the ground of the observed fact that anything comes 
<A NAME="240"></A>out of anything. For it is probably for this reason that he maintains that 
<A NAME="241"></A>once upon a time all things were together. (This flesh and this bone were 
<A NAME="242"></A>together, and so of any thing: therefore all things: and at the same time 
<A NAME="243"></A>too.) For there is a beginning of separation, not only for each thing, 
<A NAME="244"></A>but for all. Each thing that comes to be comes from a similar body, and 
<A NAME="245"></A>there is a coming to be of all things, though not, it is true, at the same 
<A NAME="246"></A>time. Hence there must also be an origin of coming to be. One such source 
<A NAME="247"></A>there is which he calls Mind, and Mind begins its work of thinking from 
<A NAME="248"></A>some starting-point. So necessarily all things must have been together 
<A NAME="249"></A>at a certain time, and must have begun to be moved at a certain 
<A NAME="250"></A>time.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>Democritus, for his part, asserts the contrary, namely that no 
<A NAME="252"></A>element arises from another element. Nevertheless for him the common body 
<A NAME="253"></A>is a source of all things, differing from part to part in size and in 
<A NAME="254"></A>shape.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then from these considerations that the inquiry concerns 
<A NAME="256"></A>the physicist. Nor is it without reason that they all make it a principle 
<A NAME="257"></A>or source. We cannot say that the infinite has no effect, and the only 
<A NAME="258"></A>effectiveness which we can ascribe to it is that of a principle. Everything 
<A NAME="259"></A>is either a source or derived from a source. But there cannot be a source 
<A NAME="260"></A>of the infinite or limitless, for that would be a limit of it. Further, 
<A NAME="261"></A>as it is a beginning, it is both uncreatable and indestructible. For there 
<A NAME="262"></A>must be a point at which what has come to be reaches completion, and also 
<A NAME="263"></A>a termination of all passing away. That is why, as we say, there is no 
<A NAME="264"></A>principle of this, but it is this which is held to be the principle of 
<A NAME="265"></A>other things, and to encompass all and to steer all, as those assert who 
<A NAME="266"></A>do not recognize, alongside the infinite, other causes, such as Mind or 
<A NAME="267"></A>Friendship. Further they identify it with the Divine, for it is 'deathless 
<A NAME="268"></A>and imperishable' as Anaximander says, with the majority of the 
<A NAME="269"></A>physicists.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>Belief in the existence of the infinite comes mainly from five 
<A NAME="271"></A>considerations:
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>(1) From the nature of time-for it is infinite.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR>(2) From the division of magnitudes-for the mathematicians also use 
<A NAME="274"></A>the notion of the infinite.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>(3) If coming to be and passing away do not give out, it is only 
<A NAME="276"></A>because that from which things come to be is infinite.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>(4) Because the limited always finds its limit in something, so 
<A NAME="278"></A>that there must be no limit, if everything is always limited by something 
<A NAME="279"></A>different from itself.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>(5) Most of all, a reason which is peculiarly appropriate and presents 
<A NAME="281"></A>the difficulty that is felt by everybody-not only number but also mathematical 
<A NAME="282"></A>magnitudes and what is outside the heaven are supposed to be infinite because 
<A NAME="283"></A>they never give out in our thought.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>The last fact (that what is outside is infinite) leads people to 
<A NAME="285"></A>suppose that body also is infinite, and that there is an infinite number 
<A NAME="286"></A>of worlds. Why should there be body in one part of the void rather than 
<A NAME="287"></A>in another? Grant only that mass is anywhere and it follows that it must 
<A NAME="288"></A>be everywhere. Also, if void and place are infinite, there must be infinite 
<A NAME="289"></A>body too, for in the case of eternal things what may be must be. But the 
<A NAME="290"></A>problem of the infinite is difficult: many contradictions result whether 
<A NAME="291"></A>we suppose it to exist or not to exist. If it exists, we have still to 
<A NAME="292"></A>ask how it exists; as a substance or as the essential attribute of some 
<A NAME="293"></A>entity? Or in neither way, yet none the less is there something which is 
<A NAME="294"></A>infinite or some things which are infinitely many?
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>The problem, however, which specially belongs to the physicist 
<A NAME="296"></A>is to investigate whether there is a sensible magnitude which is 
<A NAME="297"></A>infinite.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>We must begin by distinguishing the various senses in which the 
<A NAME="299"></A>term 'infinite' is used.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>(1) What is incapable of being gone through, because it is not 
<A NAME="301"></A>in its nature to be gone through (the sense in which the voice is 
<A NAME="302"></A>'invisible').
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>(2) What admits of being gone through, the process however having 
<A NAME="304"></A>no termination, or what scarcely admits of being gone 
<A NAME="305"></A>through.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>(3) What naturally admits of being gone through, but is not actually 
<A NAME="307"></A>gone through or does not actually reach an end.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>Further, everything that is infinite may be so in respect of addition 
<A NAME="309"></A>or division or both.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="310"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>Now it is impossible that the infinite should be a thing which 
<A NAME="312"></A>is itself infinite, separable from sensible objects. If the infinite is 
<A NAME="313"></A>neither a magnitude nor an aggregate, but is itself a substance and not 
<A NAME="314"></A>an attribute, it will be indivisible; for the divisible must be either 
<A NAME="315"></A>a magnitude or an aggregate. But if indivisible, then not infinite, except 
<A NAME="316"></A>in the sense (1) in which the voice is 'invisible'. But this is not the 
<A NAME="317"></A>sense in which it is used by those who say that the infinite exists, nor 
<A NAME="318"></A>that in which we are investigating it, namely as (2) 'that which cannot 
<A NAME="319"></A>be gone through'. But if the infinite exists as an attribute, it would 
<A NAME="320"></A>not be, qua infinite an element in substances, any more than the invisible 
<A NAME="321"></A>would be an element of speech, though the voice is invisible.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>Further, how can the infinite be itself any thing, unless both 
<A NAME="323"></A>number and magnitude, of which it is an essential attribute, exist in that 
<A NAME="324"></A>way? If they are not substances, a fortiori the infinite is 
<A NAME="325"></A>not.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>It is plain, too, that the infinite cannot be an actual thing and 
<A NAME="327"></A>a substance and principle. For any part of it that is taken will be infinite, 
<A NAME="328"></A>if it has parts: for 'to be infinite' and 'the infinite' are the same, 
<A NAME="329"></A>if it is a substance and not predicated of a subject. Hence it will be 
<A NAME="330"></A>either indivisible or divisible into infinites. But the same thing cannot 
<A NAME="331"></A>be many infinites. (Yet just as part of air is air, so a part of the infinite 
<A NAME="332"></A>would be infinite, if it is supposed to be a substance and principle.) 
<A NAME="333"></A>Therefore the infinite must be without parts and indivisible. But this 
<A NAME="334"></A>cannot be true of what is infinite in full completion: for it must be a 
<A NAME="335"></A>definite quantity.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>Suppose then that infinity belongs to substance as an attribute. 
<A NAME="337"></A>But, if so, it cannot, as we have said, be described as a principle, but 
<A NAME="338"></A>rather that of which it is an attribute-the air or the even 
<A NAME="339"></A>number.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>Thus the view of those who speak after the manner of the Pythagoreans 
<A NAME="341"></A>is absurd. With the same breath they treat the infinite as substance, and 
<A NAME="342"></A>divide it into parts.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>This discussion, however, involves the more general question whether 
<A NAME="344"></A>the infinite can be present in mathematical objects and things which are 
<A NAME="345"></A>intelligible and do not have extension, as well as among sensible objects. 
<A NAME="346"></A>Our inquiry (as physicists) is limited to its special subject-matter, the 
<A NAME="347"></A>objects of sense, and we have to ask whether there is or is not among them 
<A NAME="348"></A>a body which is infinite in the direction of increase.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>We may begin with a dialectical argument and show as follows that 
<A NAME="350"></A>there is no such thing. If 'bounded by a surface' is the definition of 
<A NAME="351"></A>body there cannot be an infinite body either intelligible or sensible. 
<A NAME="352"></A>Nor can number taken in abstraction be infinite, for number or that which 
<A NAME="353"></A>has number is numerable. If then the numerable can be numbered, it would 
<A NAME="354"></A>also be possible to go through the infinite.
<A NAME="355"></A><BR><BR>If, on the other hand, we investigate the question more in accordance 
<A NAME="356"></A>with principles appropriate to physics, we are led as follows to the same 
<A NAME="357"></A>result.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>The infinite body must be either (1) compound, or (2) simple; yet 
<A NAME="359"></A>neither alternative is possible.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>(1) Compound the infinite body will not be, if the elements are 
<A NAME="361"></A>finite in number. For they must be more than one, and the contraries must 
<A NAME="362"></A>always balance, and no one of them can be infinite. If one of the bodies 
<A NAME="363"></A>falls in any degree short of the other in potency-suppose fire is finite 
<A NAME="364"></A>in amount while air is infinite and a given quantity of fire exceeds in 
<A NAME="365"></A>power the same amount of air in any ratio provided it is numerically definite-the 
<A NAME="366"></A>infinite body will obviously prevail over and annihilate the finite body. 
<A NAME="367"></A>On the other hand, it is impossible that each should be infinite. 'Body' 
<A NAME="368"></A>is what has extension in all directions and the infinite is what is boundlessly 
<A NAME="369"></A>extended, so that the infinite body would be extended in all directions 
<A NAME="370"></A>ad infinitum.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>Nor (2) can the infinite body be one and simple, whether it is, 
<A NAME="372"></A>as some hold, a thing over and above the elements (from which they generate 
<A NAME="373"></A>the elements) or is not thus qualified.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>(a) We must consider the former alternative; for there are some 
<A NAME="375"></A>people who make this the infinite, and not air or water, in order that 
<A NAME="376"></A>the other elements may not be annihilated by the element which is infinite. 
<A NAME="377"></A>They have contrariety with each other-air is cold, water moist, fire hot; 
<A NAME="378"></A>if one were infinite, the others by now would have ceased to be. As it 
<A NAME="379"></A>is, they say, the infinite is different from them and is their 
<A NAME="380"></A>source.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>It is impossible, however, that there should be such a body; not 
<A NAME="382"></A>because it is infinite on that point a general proof can be given which 
<A NAME="383"></A>applies equally to all, air, water, or anything else-but simply because 
<A NAME="384"></A>there is, as a matter of fact, no such sensible body, alongside the so-called 
<A NAME="385"></A>elements. Everything can be resolved into the elements of which it is composed. 
<A NAME="386"></A>Hence the body in question would have been present in our world here, alongside 
<A NAME="387"></A>air and fire and earth and water: but nothing of the kind is 
<A NAME="388"></A>observed.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>(b) Nor can fire or any other of the elements be infinite. For 
<A NAME="390"></A>generally, and apart from the question of how any of them could be infinite, 
<A NAME="391"></A>the All, even if it were limited, cannot either be or become one of them, 
<A NAME="392"></A>as Heraclitus says that at some time all things become fire. (The same 
<A NAME="393"></A>argument applies also to the one which the physicists suppose to exist 
<A NAME="394"></A>alongside the elements: for everything changes from contrary to contrary, 
<A NAME="395"></A>e.g. from hot to cold).
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>The preceding consideration of the various cases serves to show 
<A NAME="397"></A>us whether it is or is not possible that there should be an infinite sensible 
<A NAME="398"></A>body. The following arguments give a general demonstration that it is not 
<A NAME="399"></A>possible.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>It is the nature of every kind of sensible body to be somewhere, 
<A NAME="401"></A>and there is a place appropriate to each, the same for the part and for 
<A NAME="402"></A>the whole, e.g. for the whole earth and for a single clod, and for fire 
<A NAME="403"></A>and for a spark.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>Suppose (a) that the infinite sensible body is homogeneous. Then 
<A NAME="405"></A>each part will be either immovable or always being carried along. Yet neither 
<A NAME="406"></A>is possible. For why downwards rather than upwards or in any other direction? 
<A NAME="407"></A>I mean, e.g, if you take a clod, where will it be moved or where will it 
<A NAME="408"></A>be at rest? For ex hypothesi the place of the body akin to it is infinite. 
<A NAME="409"></A>Will it occupy the whole place, then? And how? What then will be the nature 
<A NAME="410"></A>of its rest and of its movement, or where will they be? It will either 
<A NAME="411"></A>be at home everywhere-then it will not be moved; or it will be moved everywhere-then 
<A NAME="412"></A>it will not come to rest.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>But if (b) the All has dissimilar parts, the proper places of the 
<A NAME="414"></A>parts will be dissimilar also, and the body of the All will have no unity 
<A NAME="415"></A>except that of contact. Then, further, the parts will be either finite 
<A NAME="416"></A>or infinite in variety of kind. (i) Finite they cannot be, for if the All 
<A NAME="417"></A>is to be infinite, some of them would have to be infinite, while the others 
<A NAME="418"></A>were not, e.g. fire or water will be infinite. But, as we have seen before, 
<A NAME="419"></A>such an element would destroy what is contrary to it. (This indeed is the 
<A NAME="420"></A>reason why none of the physicists made fire or earth the one infinite body, 
<A NAME="421"></A>but either water or air or what is intermediate between them, because the 
<A NAME="422"></A>abode of each of the two was plainly determinate, while the others have 
<A NAME="423"></A>an ambiguous place between up and down.)
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>But (ii) if the parts are infinite in number and simple, their 
<A NAME="425"></A>proper places too will be infinite in number, and the same will be true 
<A NAME="426"></A>of the elements themselves. If that is impossible, and the places are finite, 
<A NAME="427"></A>the whole too must be finite; for the place and the body cannot but fit 
<A NAME="428"></A>each other. Neither is the whole place larger than what can be filled by 
<A NAME="429"></A>the body (and then the body would no longer be infinite), nor is the body 
<A NAME="430"></A>larger than the place; for either there would be an empty space or a body 
<A NAME="431"></A>whose nature it is to be nowhere.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>Anaxagoras gives an absurd account of why the infinite is at rest. 
<A NAME="433"></A>He says that the infinite itself is the cause of its being fixed. This 
<A NAME="434"></A>because it is in itself, since nothing else contains it-on the assumption 
<A NAME="435"></A>that wherever anything is, it is there by its own nature. But this is not 
<A NAME="436"></A>true: a thing could be somewhere by compulsion, and not where it is its 
<A NAME="437"></A>nature to be.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>Even if it is true as true can be that the whole is not moved (for 
<A NAME="439"></A>what is fixed by itself and is in itself must be immovable), yet we must 
<A NAME="440"></A>explain why it is not its nature to be moved. It is not enough just to 
<A NAME="441"></A>make this statement and then decamp. Anything else might be in a state 
<A NAME="442"></A>of rest, but there is no reason why it should not be its nature to be moved. 
<A NAME="443"></A>The earth is not carried along, and would not be carried along if it were 
<A NAME="444"></A>infinite, provided it is held together by the centre. But it would not 
<A NAME="445"></A>be because there was no other region in which it could be carried along 
<A NAME="446"></A>that it would remain at the centre, but because this is its nature. Yet 
<A NAME="447"></A>in this case also we may say that it fixes itself. If then in the case 
<A NAME="448"></A>of the earth, supposed to be infinite, it is at rest, not because it is 
<A NAME="449"></A>infinite, but because it has weight and what is heavy rests at the centre 
<A NAME="450"></A>and the earth is at the centre, similarly the infinite also would rest 
<A NAME="451"></A>in itself, not because it is infinite and fixes itself, but owing to some 
<A NAME="452"></A>other cause.
<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR>Another difficulty emerges at the same time. Any part of the infinite 
<A NAME="454"></A>body ought to remain at rest. Just as the infinite remains at rest in itself 
<A NAME="455"></A>because it fixes itself, so too any part of it you may take will remain 
<A NAME="456"></A>in itself. The appropriate places of the whole and of the part are alike, 
<A NAME="457"></A>e.g. of the whole earth and of a clod the appropriate place is the lower 
<A NAME="458"></A>region; of fire as a whole and of a spark, the upper region. If, therefore, 
<A NAME="459"></A>to be in itself is the place of the infinite, that also will be appropriate 
<A NAME="460"></A>to the part. Therefore it will remain in itself.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>In general, the view that there is an infinite body is plainly 
<A NAME="462"></A>incompatible with the doctrine that there is necessarily a proper place 
<A NAME="463"></A>for each kind of body, if every sensible body has either weight or lightness, 
<A NAME="464"></A>and if a body has a natural locomotion towards the centre if it is heavy, 
<A NAME="465"></A>and upwards if it is light. This would need to be true of the infinite 
<A NAME="466"></A>also. But neither character can belong to it: it cannot be either as a 
<A NAME="467"></A>whole, nor can it be half the one and half the other. For how should you 
<A NAME="468"></A>divide it? or how can the infinite have the one part up and the other down, 
<A NAME="469"></A>or an extremity and a centre?
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>Further, every sensible body is in place, and the kinds or differences 
<A NAME="471"></A>of place are up-down, before-behind, right-left; and these distinctions 
<A NAME="472"></A>hold not only in relation to us and by arbitrary agreement, but also in 
<A NAME="473"></A>the whole itself. But in the infinite body they cannot exist. In general, 
<A NAME="474"></A>if it is impossible that there should be an infinite place, and if every 
<A NAME="475"></A>body is in place, there cannot be an infinite body.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR>Surely what is in a special place is in place, and what is in place 
<A NAME="477"></A>is in a special place. Just, then, as the infinite cannot be quantity-that 
<A NAME="478"></A>would imply that it has a particular quantity, e,g, two or three cubits; 
<A NAME="479"></A>quantity just means these-so a thing's being in place means that it is 
<A NAME="480"></A>somewhere, and that is either up or down or in some other of the six differences 
<A NAME="481"></A>of position: but each of these is a limit.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>It is plain from these arguments that there is no body which is 
<A NAME="483"></A>actually infinite.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="484"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="485"></A><BR><BR>But on the other hand to suppose that the infinite does not exist 
<A NAME="486"></A>in any way leads obviously to many impossible consequences: there will 
<A NAME="487"></A>be a beginning and an end of time, a magnitude will not be divisible into 
<A NAME="488"></A>magnitudes, number will not be infinite. If, then, in view of the above 
<A NAME="489"></A>considerations, neither alternative seems possible, an arbiter must be 
<A NAME="490"></A>called in; and clearly there is a sense in which the infinite exists and 
<A NAME="491"></A>another in which it does not.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>We must keep in mind that the word 'is' means either what potentially 
<A NAME="493"></A>is or what fully is. Further, a thing is infinite either by addition or 
<A NAME="494"></A>by division.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>Now, as we have seen, magnitude is not actually infinite. But by 
<A NAME="496"></A>division it is infinite. (There is no difficulty in refuting the theory 
<A NAME="497"></A>of indivisible lines.) The alternative then remains that the infinite has 
<A NAME="498"></A>a potential existence.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR>But the phrase 'potential existence' is ambiguous. When we speak 
<A NAME="500"></A>of the potential existence of a statue we mean that there will be an actual 
<A NAME="501"></A>statue. It is not so with the infinite. There will not be an actual infinite. 
<A NAME="502"></A>The word 'is' has many senses, and we say that the infinite 'is' in the 
<A NAME="503"></A>sense in which we say 'it is day' or 'it is the games', because one thing 
<A NAME="504"></A>after another is always coming into existence. For of these things too 
<A NAME="505"></A>the distinction between potential and actual existence holds. We say that 
<A NAME="506"></A>there are Olympic games, both in the sense that they may occur and that 
<A NAME="507"></A>they are actually occurring.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>The infinite exhibits itself in different ways-in time, in the 
<A NAME="509"></A>generations of man, and in the division of magnitudes. For generally the 
<A NAME="510"></A>infinite has this mode of existence: one thing is always being taken after 
<A NAME="511"></A>another, and each thing that is taken is always finite, but always different. 
<A NAME="512"></A>Again, 'being' has more than one sense, so that we must not regard the 
<A NAME="513"></A>infinite as a 'this', such as a man or a horse, but must suppose it to 
<A NAME="514"></A>exist in the sense in which we speak of the day or the games as existing 
<A NAME="515"></A>things whose being has not come to them like that of a substance, but consists 
<A NAME="516"></A>in a process of coming to be or passing away; definite if you like at each 
<A NAME="517"></A>stage, yet always different.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>But when this takes place in spatial magnitudes, what is taken 
<A NAME="519"></A>perists, while in the succession of time and of men it takes place by the 
<A NAME="520"></A>passing away of these in such a way that the source of supply never gives 
<A NAME="521"></A>out.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>In a way the infinite by addition is the same thing as the infinite 
<A NAME="523"></A>by division. In a finite magnitude, the infinite by addition comes about 
<A NAME="524"></A>in a way inverse to that of the other. For in proportion as we see division 
<A NAME="525"></A>going on, in the same proportion we see addition being made to what is 
<A NAME="526"></A>already marked off. For if we take a determinate part of a finite magnitude 
<A NAME="527"></A>and add another part determined by the same ratio (not taking in the same 
<A NAME="528"></A>amount of the original whole), and so on, we shall not traverse the given 
<A NAME="529"></A>magnitude. But if we increase the ratio of the part, so as always to take 
<A NAME="530"></A>in the same amount, we shall traverse the magnitude, for every finite magnitude 
<A NAME="531"></A>is exhausted by means of any determinate quantity however 
<A NAME="532"></A>small.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>The infinite, then, exists in no other way, but in this way it 
<A NAME="534"></A>does exist, potentially and by reduction. It exists fully in the sense 
<A NAME="535"></A>in which we say 'it is day' or 'it is the games'; and potentially as matter 
<A NAME="536"></A>exists, not independently as what is finite does.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>By addition then, also, there is potentially an infinite, namely, 
<A NAME="538"></A>what we have described as being in a sense the same as the infinite in 
<A NAME="539"></A>respect of division. For it will always be possible to take something ah 
<A NAME="540"></A>extra. Yet the sum of the parts taken will not exceed every determinate 
<A NAME="541"></A>magnitude, just as in the direction of division every determinate magnitude 
<A NAME="542"></A>is surpassed in smallness and there will be a smaller 
<A NAME="543"></A>part.
<A NAME="544"></A><BR><BR>But in respect of addition there cannot be an infinite which even 
<A NAME="545"></A>potentially exceeds every assignable magnitude, unless it has the attribute 
<A NAME="546"></A>of being actually infinite, as the physicists hold to be true of the body 
<A NAME="547"></A>which is outside the world, whose essential nature is air or something 
<A NAME="548"></A>of the kind. But if there cannot be in this way a sensible body which is 
<A NAME="549"></A>infinite in the full sense, evidently there can no more be a body which 
<A NAME="550"></A>is potentially infinite in respect of addition, except as the inverse of 
<A NAME="551"></A>the infinite by division, as we have said. It is for this reason that Plato 
<A NAME="552"></A>also made the infinites two in number, because it is supposed to be possible 
<A NAME="553"></A>to exceed all limits and to proceed ad infinitum in the direction both 
<A NAME="554"></A>of increase and of reduction. Yet though he makes the infinites two, he 
<A NAME="555"></A>does not use them. For in the numbers the infinite in the direction of 
<A NAME="556"></A>reduction is not present, as the monad is the smallest; nor is the infinite 
<A NAME="557"></A>in the direction of increase, for the parts number only up to the 
<A NAME="558"></A>decad.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>The infinite turns out to be the contrary of what it is said to 
<A NAME="560"></A>be. It is not what has nothing outside it that is infinite, but what always 
<A NAME="561"></A>has something outside it. This is indicated by the fact that rings also 
<A NAME="562"></A>that have no bezel are described as 'endless', because it is always possible 
<A NAME="563"></A>to take a part which is outside a given part. The description depends on 
<A NAME="564"></A>a certain similarity, but it is not true in the full sense of the word. 
<A NAME="565"></A>This condition alone is not sufficient: it is necessary also that the next 
<A NAME="566"></A>part which is taken should never be the same. In the circle, the latter 
<A NAME="567"></A>condition is not satisfied: it is only the adjacent part from which the 
<A NAME="568"></A>new part is different.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>Our definition then is as follows:
<A NAME="570"></A><BR>A quantity is infinite if it is such that we can always take a part 
<A NAME="571"></A>outside what has been already taken. On the other hand, what has nothing 
<A NAME="572"></A>outside it is complete and whole. For thus we define the whole-that from 
<A NAME="573"></A>which nothing is wanting, as a whole man or a whole box. What is true of 
<A NAME="574"></A>each particular is true of the whole as such-the whole is that of which 
<A NAME="575"></A>nothing is outside. On the other hand that from which something is absent 
<A NAME="576"></A>and outside, however small that may be, is not 'all'. 'Whole' and 'complete' 
<A NAME="577"></A>are either quite identical or closely akin. Nothing is complete (teleion) 
<A NAME="578"></A>which has no end (telos); and the end is a limit.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR>Hence Parmenides must be thought to have spoken better than Melissus. 
<A NAME="580"></A>The latter says that the whole is infinite, but the former describes it 
<A NAME="581"></A>as limited, 'equally balanced from the middle'. For to connect the infinite 
<A NAME="582"></A>with the all and the whole is not like joining two pieces of string; for 
<A NAME="583"></A>it is from this they get the dignity they ascribe to the infinite-its containing 
<A NAME="584"></A>all things and holding the all in itself-from its having a certain similarity 
<A NAME="585"></A>to the whole. It is in fact the matter of the completeness which belongs 
<A NAME="586"></A>to size, and what is potentially a whole, though not in the full sense. 
<A NAME="587"></A>It is divisible both in the direction of reduction and of the inverse addition. 
<A NAME="588"></A>It is a whole and limited; not, however, in virtue of its own nature, but 
<A NAME="589"></A>in virtue of what is other than it. It does not contain, but, in so far 
<A NAME="590"></A>as it is infinite, is contained. Consequently, also, it is unknowable, 
<A NAME="591"></A>qua infinite; for the matter has no form. (Hence it is plain that the infinite 
<A NAME="592"></A>stands in the relation of part rather than of whole. For the matter is 
<A NAME="593"></A>part of the whole, as the bronze is of the bronze statue.) If it contains 
<A NAME="594"></A>in the case of sensible things, in the case of intelligible things the 
<A NAME="595"></A>great and the small ought to contain them. But it is absurd and impossible 
<A NAME="596"></A>to suppose that the unknowable and indeterminate should contain and 
<A NAME="597"></A>determine.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="598"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>It is reasonable that there should not be held to be an infinite 
<A NAME="600"></A>in respect of addition such as to surpass every magnitude, but that there 
<A NAME="601"></A>should be thought to be such an infinite in the direction of division. 
<A NAME="602"></A>For the matter and the infinite are contained inside what contains them, 
<A NAME="603"></A>while it is the form which contains. It is natural too to suppose that 
<A NAME="604"></A>in number there is a limit in the direction of the minimum, and that in 
<A NAME="605"></A>the other direction every assigned number is surpassed. In magnitude, on 
<A NAME="606"></A>the contrary, every assigned magnitude is surpassed in the direction of 
<A NAME="607"></A>smallness, while in the other direction there is no infinite magnitude. 
<A NAME="608"></A>The reason is that what is one is indivisible whatever it may be, e.g. 
<A NAME="609"></A>a man is one man, not many. Number on the other hand is a plurality of 
<A NAME="610"></A>'ones' and a certain quantity of them. Hence number must stop at the indivisible: 
<A NAME="611"></A>for 'two' and 'three' are merely derivative terms, and so with each of 
<A NAME="612"></A>the other numbers. But in the direction of largeness it is always possible 
<A NAME="613"></A>to think of a larger number: for the number of times a magnitude can be 
<A NAME="614"></A>bisected is infinite. Hence this infinite is potential, never actual: the 
<A NAME="615"></A>number of parts that can be taken always surpasses any assigned number. 
<A NAME="616"></A>But this number is not separable from the process of bisection, and its 
<A NAME="617"></A>infinity is not a permanent actuality but consists in a process of coming 
<A NAME="618"></A>to be, like time and the number of time.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>With magnitudes the contrary holds. What is continuous is divided 
<A NAME="620"></A>ad infinitum, but there is no infinite in the direction of increase. For 
<A NAME="621"></A>the size which it can potentially be, it can also actually be. Hence since 
<A NAME="622"></A>no sensible magnitude is infinite, it is impossible to exceed every assigned 
<A NAME="623"></A>magnitude; for if it were possible there would be something bigger than 
<A NAME="624"></A>the heavens.
<A NAME="625"></A><BR><BR>The infinite is not the same in magnitude and movement and time, 
<A NAME="626"></A>in the sense of a single nature, but its secondary sense depends on its 
<A NAME="627"></A>primary sense, i.e. movement is called infinite in virtue of the magnitude 
<A NAME="628"></A>covered by the movement (or alteration or growth), and time because of 
<A NAME="629"></A>the movement. (I use these terms for the moment. Later I shall explain 
<A NAME="630"></A>what each of them means, and also why every magnitude is divisible into 
<A NAME="631"></A>magnitudes.)
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR>Our account does not rob the mathematicians of their science, by 
<A NAME="633"></A>disproving the actual existence of the infinite in the direction of increase, 
<A NAME="634"></A>in the sense of the untraversable. In point of fact they do not need the 
<A NAME="635"></A>infinite and do not use it. They postulate only that the finite straight 
<A NAME="636"></A>line may be produced as far as they wish. It is possible to have divided 
<A NAME="637"></A>in the same ratio as the largest quantity another magnitude of any size 
<A NAME="638"></A>you like. Hence, for the purposes of proof, it will make no difference 
<A NAME="639"></A>to them to have such an infinite instead, while its existence will be in 
<A NAME="640"></A>the sphere of real magnitudes.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>In the fourfold scheme of causes, it is plain that the infinite 
<A NAME="642"></A>is a cause in the sense of matter, and that its essence is privation, the 
<A NAME="643"></A>subject as such being what is continuous and sensible. All the other thinkers, 
<A NAME="644"></A>too, evidently treat the infinite as matter-that is why it is inconsistent 
<A NAME="645"></A>in them to make it what contains, and not what is contained.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="646"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR>It remains to dispose of the arguments which are supposed to support 
<A NAME="648"></A>the view that the infinite exists not only potentially but as a separate 
<A NAME="649"></A>thing. Some have no cogency; others can be met by fresh objections that 
<A NAME="650"></A>are valid.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR>(1) In order that coming to be should not fail, it is not necessary 
<A NAME="652"></A>that there should be a sensible body which is actually infinite. The passing 
<A NAME="653"></A>away of one thing may be the coming to be of another, the All being 
<A NAME="654"></A>limited.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>(2) There is a difference between touching and being limited. The 
<A NAME="656"></A>former is relative to something and is the touching of something (for everything 
<A NAME="657"></A>that touches touches something), and further is an attribute of some one 
<A NAME="658"></A>of the things which are limited. On the other hand, what is limited is 
<A NAME="659"></A>not limited in relation to anything. Again, contact is not necessarily 
<A NAME="660"></A>possible between any two things taken at random.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR>(3) To rely on mere thinking is absurd, for then the excess or 
<A NAME="662"></A>defect is not in the thing but in the thought. One might think that one 
<A NAME="663"></A>of us is bigger than he is and magnify him ad infinitum. But it does not 
<A NAME="664"></A>follow that he is bigger than the size we are, just because some one thinks 
<A NAME="665"></A>he is, but only because he is the size he is. The thought is an 
<A NAME="666"></A>accident.
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>(a) Time indeed and movement are infinite, and also thinking, in 
<A NAME="668"></A>the sense that each part that is taken passes in succession out of 
<A NAME="669"></A>existence.
<A NAME="670"></A><BR><BR>(b) Magnitude is not infinite either in the way of reduction or 
<A NAME="671"></A>of magnification in thought.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>This concludes my account of the way in which the infinite exists, 
<A NAME="673"></A>and of the way in which it does not exist, and of what it 
<A NAME="674"></A>is.
