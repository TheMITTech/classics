<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>

<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>As to the divination which takes place in sleep, and is said to be based 
<A NAME="12"></A>on dreams, we cannot lightly either dismiss it with contempt or give it 
<A NAME="13"></A>implicit confidence. The fact that all persons, or many, suppose dreams 
<A NAME="14"></A>to possess a special significance, tends to inspire us with belief in it 
<A NAME="15"></A>[such divination], as founded on the testimony of experience; and indeed 
<A NAME="16"></A>that divination in dreams should, as regards some subjects, be genuine, 
<A NAME="17"></A>is not incredible, for it has a show of reason; from which one might form 
<A NAME="18"></A>a like opinion also respecting all other dreams. Yet the fact of our seeing 
<A NAME="19"></A>no probable cause to account for such divination tends to inspire us with 
<A NAME="20"></A>distrust. For, in addition to its further unreasonableness, it is absurd 
<A NAME="21"></A>to combine the idea that the sender of such dreams should be God with the 
<A NAME="22"></A>fact that those to whom he sends them are not the best and wisest, but 
<A NAME="23"></A>merely commonplace persons. If, however, we abstract from the causality 
<A NAME="24"></A>of God, none of the other causes assigned appears probable. For that certain 
<A NAME="25"></A>persons should have foresight in dreams concerning things destined to take 
<A NAME="26"></A>place at the Pillars of Hercules, or on the banks of the Borysthenes, seems 
<A NAME="27"></A>to be something to discover the explanation of which surpasses the wit 
<A NAME="28"></A>of man. Well then, the dreams in question must be regarded either as causes, 
<A NAME="29"></A>or as tokens, of the events, or else as coincidences; either as all, or 
<A NAME="30"></A>some, of these, or as one only. I use the word 'cause' in the sense in 
<A NAME="31"></A>which the moon is [the cause] of an eclipse of the sun, or in which fatigue 
<A NAME="32"></A>is [a cause] of fever; 'token' [in the sense in which] the entrance of 
<A NAME="33"></A>a star [into the shadow] is a token of the eclipse, or [in which] roughness 
<A NAME="34"></A>of the tongue [is a token] of fever; while by 'coincidence' I mean, for 
<A NAME="35"></A>example, the occurrence of an eclipse of the sun while some one is taking 
<A NAME="36"></A>a walk; for the walking is neither a token nor a cause of the eclipse, 
<A NAME="37"></A>nor the eclipse [a cause or token] of the walking. For this reason no coincidence 
<A NAME="38"></A>takes place according to a universal or general rule. Are we then to say 
<A NAME="39"></A>that some dreams are causes, others tokens, e.g. of events taking place 
<A NAME="40"></A>in the bodily organism? At all events, even scientific physicians tell 
<A NAME="41"></A>us that one should pay diligent attention to dreams, and to hold this view 
<A NAME="42"></A>is reasonable also for those who are not practitioners, but speculative 
<A NAME="43"></A>philosophers. For the movements which occur in the daytime [within the 
<A NAME="44"></A>body] are, unless very great and violent, lost sight of in contrast with 
<A NAME="45"></A>the waking movements, which are more impressive. In sleep the opposite 
<A NAME="46"></A>takes place, for then even trifling movements seem considerable. This is 
<A NAME="47"></A>plain in what often happens during sleep; for example, dreamers fancy that 
<A NAME="48"></A>they are affected by thunder and lightning, when in fact there are only 
<A NAME="49"></A>faint ringings in their ears; or that they are enjoying honey or other 
<A NAME="50"></A>sweet savours, when only a tiny drop of phlegm is flowing down [the oesophagus]; 
<A NAME="51"></A>or that they are walking through fire, and feeling intense heat, when there 
<A NAME="52"></A>is only a slight warmth affecting certain parts of the body. When they 
<A NAME="53"></A>are awakened, these things appear to them in this their true character. 
<A NAME="54"></A>But since the beginnings of all events are small, so, it is clear, are 
<A NAME="55"></A>those also of the diseases or other affections about to occur in our bodies. 
<A NAME="56"></A>In conclusion, it is manifest that these beginnings must be more evident 
<A NAME="57"></A>in sleeping than in waking moments.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>Nay, indeed, it is not improbable that some of the presentations 
<A NAME="59"></A>which come before the mind in sleep may even be causes of the actions cognate 
<A NAME="60"></A>to each of them. For as when we are about to act [in waking hours], or 
<A NAME="61"></A>are engaged in any course of action, or have already performed certain 
<A NAME="62"></A>actions, we often find ourselves concerned with these actions, or performing 
<A NAME="63"></A>them, in a vivid dream; the cause whereof is that the dream-movement has 
<A NAME="64"></A>had a way paved for it from the original movements set up in the daytime; 
<A NAME="65"></A>exactly so, but conversely, it must happen that the movements set up first 
<A NAME="66"></A>in sleep should also prove to be starting-points of actions to be performed 
<A NAME="67"></A>in the daytime, since the recurrence by day of the thought of these actions 
<A NAME="68"></A>also has had its way paved for it in the images before the mind at night. 
<A NAME="69"></A>Thus then it is quite conceivable that some dreams may be tokens and causes 
<A NAME="70"></A>[of future events].
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Most [so-called prophetic] dreams are, however, to be classed as 
<A NAME="72"></A>mere coincidences, especially all such as are extravagant, and those in 
<A NAME="73"></A>the fulfilment of which the dreamers have no initiative, such as in the 
<A NAME="74"></A>case of a sea-fight, or of things taking place far away. As regards these 
<A NAME="75"></A>it is natural that the fact should stand as it does whenever a person, 
<A NAME="76"></A>on mentioning something, finds the very thing mentioned come to pass. Why, 
<A NAME="77"></A>indeed, should this not happen also in sleep? The probability is, rather, 
<A NAME="78"></A>that many such things should happen. As, then, one's mentioning a particular 
<A NAME="79"></A>person is neither token nor cause of this person's presenting himself, 
<A NAME="80"></A>so, in the parallel instance, the dream is, to him who has seen it, neither 
<A NAME="81"></A>token nor cause of its [so-called] fulfilment, but a mere coincidence. 
<A NAME="82"></A>Hence the fact that many dreams have no 'fulfilment', for coincidence do 
<A NAME="83"></A>not occur according to any universal or general law.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="84"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>On the whole, forasmuch as certain of the lower animals also dream, 
<A NAME="86"></A>it may be concluded that dreams are not sent by God, nor are they designed 
<A NAME="87"></A>for this purpose [to reveal the future]. They have a divine aspect, however, 
<A NAME="88"></A>for Nature [their cause] is divinely planned, though not itself divine. 
<A NAME="89"></A>A special proof [of their not being sent by God] is this: the power of 
<A NAME="90"></A>foreseeing the future and of having vivid dreams is found in persons of 
<A NAME="91"></A>inferior type, which implies that God does not send their dreams; but merely 
<A NAME="92"></A>that all those whose physical temperament is, as it were, garrulous and 
<A NAME="93"></A>excitable, see sights of all descriptions; for, inasmuch as they experience 
<A NAME="94"></A>many movements of every kind, they just chance to have visions resembling 
<A NAME="95"></A>objective facts, their luck in these matters being merely like that of 
<A NAME="96"></A>persons who play at even and odd. For the principle which is expressed 
<A NAME="97"></A>in the gambler's maxim: 'If you make many throws your luck must change,' 
<A NAME="98"></A>holds in their case also.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>That many dreams have no fulfilment is not strange, for it is so 
<A NAME="100"></A>too with many bodily toms and weather-signs, e.g. those of rain or wind. 
<A NAME="101"></A>For if another movement occurs more influential than that from which, while 
<A NAME="102"></A>[the event to which it pointed was] still future, the given token was derived, 
<A NAME="103"></A>the event [to which such token pointed] does not take place. So, of the 
<A NAME="104"></A>things which ought to be accomplished by human agency, many, though well-planned 
<A NAME="105"></A>are by the operation of other principles more powerful [than man's agency] 
<A NAME="106"></A>brought to nought. For, speaking generally, that which was about to happen 
<A NAME="107"></A>is not in every case what now is happening, nor is that which shall hereafter 
<A NAME="108"></A>he identical with that which is now going to be. Still, however, we must 
<A NAME="109"></A>hold that the beginnings from which, as we said, no consummation follows, 
<A NAME="110"></A>are real beginnings, and these constitute natural tokens of certain events, 
<A NAME="111"></A>even though the events do not come to pass.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>As for [prophetic] dreams which involve not such beginnings [sc. 
<A NAME="113"></A>of future events] as we have here described, but such as are extravagant 
<A NAME="114"></A>in times, or places, or magnitudes; or those involving beginnings which 
<A NAME="115"></A>are not extravagant in any of these respects, while yet the persons who 
<A NAME="116"></A>see the dream hold not in their own hands the beginnings [of the event 
<A NAME="117"></A>to which it points]: unless the foresight which such dreams give is the 
<A NAME="118"></A>result of pure coincidence, the following would be a better explanation 
<A NAME="119"></A>of it than that proposed by Democritus, who alleges 'images' and 'emanations' 
<A NAME="120"></A>as its cause. As, when something has caused motion in water or air, this 
<A NAME="121"></A>[the portion of water or air], and, though the cause has ceased to operate, 
<A NAME="122"></A>such motion propagates itself to a certain point, though there the prime 
<A NAME="123"></A>movement is not present; just so it may well be that a movement and a consequent 
<A NAME="124"></A>sense-perception should reach sleeping souls from the objects from which 
<A NAME="125"></A>Democritus represents 'images' and 'emanations' coming; that such movements, 
<A NAME="126"></A>in whatever way they arrive, should be more perceptible at night [than 
<A NAME="127"></A>by day], because when proceeding thus in the daytime they are more liable 
<A NAME="128"></A>to dissolution (since at night the air is less disturbed, there being then 
<A NAME="129"></A>less wind); and that they shall be perceived within the body owing to sleep, 
<A NAME="130"></A>since persons are more sensitive even to slight sensory movements when 
<A NAME="131"></A>asleep than when awake. It is these movements then that cause 'presentations', 
<A NAME="132"></A>as a result of which sleepers foresee the future even relatively to such 
<A NAME="133"></A>events as those referred to above. These considerations also explain why 
<A NAME="134"></A>this experience befalls commonplace persons and not the most intelligent. 
<A NAME="135"></A>For it would have regularly occurred both in the daytime and to the wise 
<A NAME="136"></A>had it been God who sent it; but, as we have explained the matter, it is 
<A NAME="137"></A>quite natural that commonplace persons should be those who have foresight 
<A NAME="138"></A>[in dreams]. For the mind of such persons is not given to thinking, but, 
<A NAME="139"></A>as it were, derelict, or totally vacant, and, when once set moving, is 
<A NAME="140"></A>borne passively on in the direction taken by that which moves it. With 
<A NAME="141"></A>regard to the fact that some persons who are liable to derangement have 
<A NAME="142"></A>this foresight, its explanation is that their normal mental movements do 
<A NAME="143"></A>not impede [the alien movements], but are beaten off by the latter. Therefore 
<A NAME="144"></A>it is that they have an especially keen perception of the alien 
<A NAME="145"></A>movements.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>That certain persons in particular should have vivid dreams, e.g. 
<A NAME="147"></A>that familiar friends should thus have foresight in a special degree respecting 
<A NAME="148"></A>one another, is due to the fact that such friends are most solicitous on 
<A NAME="149"></A>one another's behalf. For as acquaintances in particular recognize and 
<A NAME="150"></A>perceive one another a long way off, so also they do as regards the sensory 
<A NAME="151"></A>movements respecting one another; for sensory movements which refer to 
<A NAME="152"></A>persons familiarly known are themselves more familiar. Atrabilious persons, 
<A NAME="153"></A>owing to their impetuosity, are, when they, as it were, shoot from a distance, 
<A NAME="154"></A>expert at hitting; while, owing to their mutability, the series of movements 
<A NAME="155"></A>deploys quickly before their minds. For even as the insane recite, or con 
<A NAME="156"></A>over in thought, the poems of Philaegides, e.g. the Aphrodite, whose parts 
<A NAME="157"></A>succeed in order of similitude, just so do they <BR><I>the 
<A NAME="158"></A>'atrabilious'</I>
<A NAME="159"></A>go on and on stringing sensory movements together.Moreover, owing to their 
<A NAME="160"></A>aforesaid impetuosity, one movement within them is not liable to be knocked 
<A NAME="161"></A>out of its course by some other movement.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>The most skilful interpreter of dreams is he who has the faculty 
<A NAME="163"></A>of observing resemblances. Any one may interpret dreams which are vivid 
<A NAME="164"></A>and plain. But, speaking of 'resemblances', I mean that dream presentations 
<A NAME="165"></A>are analogous to the forms reflected in water, as indeed we have already 
<A NAME="166"></A>stated. In the latter case, if the motion in the water be great, the reflexion 
<A NAME="167"></A>has no resemblance to its original, nor do the forms resemble the real 
<A NAME="168"></A>objects. Skilful, indeed, would he be in interpreting such reflexions who 
<A NAME="169"></A>could rapidly discern, and at a glance comprehend, the scattered and distorted 
<A NAME="170"></A>fragments of such forms, so as to perceive that one of them represents 
<A NAME="171"></A>a man, or a horse, Or anything whatever. Accordingly, in the other case 
<A NAME="172"></A>also, in a similar way, some such thing as this [blurred image] is all 
<A NAME="173"></A>that a dream amounts to; for the internal movement effaces the clearness 
<A NAME="174"></A>of the dream.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>The questions, therefore, which we proposed as to the nature of 
<A NAME="176"></A>sleep and the dream, and the cause to which each of them is due, and also 
<A NAME="177"></A>as to divination as a result of dreams, in every form of it, have now been 
<A NAME="178"></A>discussed.
