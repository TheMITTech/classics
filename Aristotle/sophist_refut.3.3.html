<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 21</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Accentuation gives rise to no fallacious arguments, either as written or 
<A NAME="12"></A>as spoken, except perhaps some few that might be made up; e.g. the following 
<A NAME="13"></A>argument. 'Is ou katalueis a house?' 'Yes.' 'Is then ou katalueis the negation 
<A NAME="14"></A>of katalueis?' 'Yes.' 'But you said that ou katalueis is a house: therefore 
<A NAME="15"></A>the house is a negation.' How one should solve this, is clear: for the 
<A NAME="16"></A>word does not mean the same when spoken with an acuter and when spoken 
<A NAME="17"></A>with a graver accent.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="18"></A><B>Part 22</B>

<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>It is clear also how one must meet those fallacies that depend 
<A NAME="20"></A>on the identical expressions of things that are not identical, seeing that 
<A NAME="21"></A>we are in possession of the kinds of predications. For the one man, say, 
<A NAME="22"></A>has granted, when asked, that a term denoting a substance does not belong 
<A NAME="23"></A>as an attribute, while the other has shown that some attribute belongs 
<A NAME="24"></A>which is in the Category of Relation or of Quantity, but is usually thought 
<A NAME="25"></A>to denote a substance because of its expression; e.g. in the following 
<A NAME="26"></A>argument: 'Is it possible to be doing and to have done the same thing at 
<A NAME="27"></A>the same time?' 'No.' 'But, you see, it is surely possible to be seeing 
<A NAME="28"></A>and to have seen the same thing at the same time, and in the same aspect.' 
<A NAME="29"></A>Again, 'Is any mode of passivity a mode of activity?' 'No.' 'Then "he is 
<A NAME="30"></A>cut", "he is burnt", "he is struck by some sensible object" are alike in 
<A NAME="31"></A>expression and all denote some form of passivity, while again "to say", 
<A NAME="32"></A>"to run", "to see" are like one like one another in expression: but, you 
<A NAME="33"></A>see, "to see" is surely a form of being struck by a sensible object; therefore 
<A NAME="34"></A>it is at the same time a form of passivity and of activity.' Suppose, however, 
<A NAME="35"></A>that in that case any one, after granting that it is not possible to do 
<A NAME="36"></A>and to have done the same thing in the same time, were to say that it is 
<A NAME="37"></A>possible to see and to have seen it, still he has not yet been refuted, 
<A NAME="38"></A>suppose him to say that 'to see' is not a form of 'doing' (activity) but 
<A NAME="39"></A>of 'passivity': for this question is required as well, though he is supposed 
<A NAME="40"></A>by the listener to have already granted it, when he granted that 'to cut' 
<A NAME="41"></A>is a form of present, and 'to have cut' a form of past, activity, and so 
<A NAME="42"></A>on with the other things that have a like expression. For the listener 
<A NAME="43"></A>adds the rest by himself, thinking the meaning to be alike: whereas really 
<A NAME="44"></A>the meaning is not alike, though it appears to be so because of the expression. 
<A NAME="45"></A>The same thing happens here as happens in cases of ambiguity: for in dealing 
<A NAME="46"></A>with ambiguous expressions the tyro in argument supposes the sophist to 
<A NAME="47"></A>have negated the fact which he (the tyro) affirmed, and not merely the 
<A NAME="48"></A>name: whereas there still wants the question whether in using the ambiguous 
<A NAME="49"></A>term he had a single meaning in view: for if he grants that that was so, 
<A NAME="50"></A>the refutation will be effected.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>Like the above are also the following arguments. It is asked if 
<A NAME="52"></A>a man has lost what he once had and afterwards has not: for a man will 
<A NAME="53"></A>no longer have ten dice even though he has only lost one die. No: rather 
<A NAME="54"></A>it is that he has lost what he had before and has not now; but there is 
<A NAME="55"></A>no necessity for him to have lost as much or as many things as he has not 
<A NAME="56"></A>now. So then, he asks the questions as to what he has, and draws the conclusion 
<A NAME="57"></A>as to the whole number that he has: for ten is a number. If then he had 
<A NAME="58"></A>asked to begin with, whether a man no longer having the number of things 
<A NAME="59"></A>he once had has lost the whole number, no one would have granted it, but 
<A NAME="60"></A>would have said 'Either the whole number or one of them'. Also there is 
<A NAME="61"></A>the argument that 'a man may give what he has not got': for he has not 
<A NAME="62"></A>got only one die. No: rather it is that he has given not what he had not 
<A NAME="63"></A>got, but in a manner in which he had not got it, viz. just the one. For 
<A NAME="64"></A>the word 'only' does not signify a particular substance or quality or number, 
<A NAME="65"></A>but a manner relation, e.g. that it is not coupled with any other. It is 
<A NAME="66"></A>therefore just as if he had asked 'Could a man give what he has not got?' 
<A NAME="67"></A>and, on being given the answer 'No', were to ask if a man could give a 
<A NAME="68"></A>thing quickly when he had not got it quickly, and, on this being granted, 
<A NAME="69"></A>were to conclude that 'a man could give what he had not got'. It is quite 
<A NAME="70"></A>evident that he has not proved his point: for to 'give quickly' is not 
<A NAME="71"></A>to give a thing, but to give in a certain manner; and a man could certainly 
<A NAME="72"></A>give a thing in a manner in which he has not got it, e.g. he might have 
<A NAME="73"></A>got it with pleasure and give it with pain.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>Like these are also all arguments of the following kind: 'Could 
<A NAME="75"></A>a man strike a blow with a hand which he has not got, or see with an eye 
<A NAME="76"></A>which he has not got?' For he has not got only one eye. Some people solve 
<A NAME="77"></A>this case, where a man has more than one eye, or more than one of anything 
<A NAME="78"></A>else, by saying also that he has only one. Others also solve it as they 
<A NAME="79"></A>solve the refutation of the view that 'what a man has, he has received': 
<A NAME="80"></A>for A gave only one vote; and certainly B, they say, has only one vote 
<A NAME="81"></A>from A. Others, again, proceed by demolishing straight away the proposition 
<A NAME="82"></A>asked, and admitting that it is quite possible to have what one has not 
<A NAME="83"></A>received; e.g. to have received sweet wine, but then, owing to its going 
<A NAME="84"></A>bad in the course of receipt, to have it sour. But, as was said also above,' 
<A NAME="85"></A>all these persons direct their solutions against the man, not against his 
<A NAME="86"></A>argument. For if this were a genuine solution, then, suppose any one to 
<A NAME="87"></A>grant the opposite, he could find no solution, just as happens in other 
<A NAME="88"></A>cases; e.g. suppose the true solution to be 'So-and-so is partly true and 
<A NAME="89"></A>partly not', then, if the answerer grants the expression without any qualification, 
<A NAME="90"></A>the sophist's conclusion follows. If, on the other hand, the conclusion 
<A NAME="91"></A>does not follow, then that could not be the true solution: and what we 
<A NAME="92"></A>say in regard to the foregoing examples is that, even if all the sophist's 
<A NAME="93"></A>premisses be granted, still no proof is effected.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, the following too belong to this group of arguments. 
<A NAME="95"></A>'If something be in writing did some one write it?' 'Yes.' 'But it is now 
<A NAME="96"></A>in writing that you are seated-a false statement, though it was true at 
<A NAME="97"></A>the time when it was written: therefore the statement that was written 
<A NAME="98"></A>is at the same time false and true.' But this is fallacious, for the falsity 
<A NAME="99"></A>or truth of a statement or opinion indicates not a substance but a quality: 
<A NAME="100"></A>for the same account applies to the case of an opinion as well. Again, 
<A NAME="101"></A>'Is what a learner learns what he learns?' 'Yes.' 'But suppose some one 
<A NAME="102"></A>learns "slow" quick'. Then his (the sophist's) words denote not what the 
<A NAME="103"></A>learner learns but how he learns it. Also, 'Does a man tread upon what 
<A NAME="104"></A>he walks through? 'Yes.' 'But X walks through a whole day.' No, rather 
<A NAME="105"></A>the words denote not what he walks through, but when he walks; just as 
<A NAME="106"></A>when any one uses the words 'to drink the cup' he denotes not what he drinks, 
<A NAME="107"></A>but the vessel out of which he drinks. Also, 'Is it either by learning 
<A NAME="108"></A>or by discovery that a man knows what he knows?' 'Yes.' 'But suppose that 
<A NAME="109"></A>of a pair of things he has discovered one and learned the other, the pair 
<A NAME="110"></A>is not known to him by either method.' No: 'what' he knows, means' every 
<A NAME="111"></A>single thing' he knows, individually; but this does not mean 'all the things' 
<A NAME="112"></A>he knows, collectively. Again, there is the proof that there is a 'third 
<A NAME="113"></A>man' distinct from Man and from individual men. But that is a fallacy, 
<A NAME="114"></A>for 'Man', and indeed every general predicate, denotes not an individual 
<A NAME="115"></A>substance, but a particular quality, or the being related to something 
<A NAME="116"></A>in a particular manner, or something of that sort. Likewise also in the 
<A NAME="117"></A>case of 'Coriscus' and 'Coriscus the musician' there is the problem, Are 
<A NAME="118"></A>they the same or different?' For the one denotes an individual substance 
<A NAME="119"></A>and the other a quality, so that it cannot be isolated; though it is not 
<A NAME="120"></A>the isolation which creates the 'third man', but the admission that it 
<A NAME="121"></A>is an individual substance. For 'Man' cannot be an individual substance, 
<A NAME="122"></A>as Callias is. Nor is the case improved one whit even if one were to call 
<A NAME="123"></A>the clement he has isolated not an individual substance but a quality: 
<A NAME="124"></A>for there will still be the one beside the many, just as 'Man' was. It 
<A NAME="125"></A>is evident then that one must not grant that what is a common predicate 
<A NAME="126"></A>applying to a class universally is an individual substance, but must say 
<A NAME="127"></A>that denotes either a quality, or a relation, or a quantity, or something 
<A NAME="128"></A>of that kind.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="129"></A><B>Part 23</B>

<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>It is a general rule in dealing with arguments that depend on language 
<A NAME="131"></A>that the solution always follows the opposite of the point on which the 
<A NAME="132"></A>argument turns: e.g. if the argument depends upon combination, then the 
<A NAME="133"></A>solution consists in division; if upon division, then in combination. Again, 
<A NAME="134"></A>if it depends on an acute accent, the solution is a grave accent; if on 
<A NAME="135"></A>a grave accent, it is an acute. If it depends on ambiguity, one can solve 
<A NAME="136"></A>it by using the opposite term; e.g. if you find yourself calling something 
<A NAME="137"></A>inanimate, despite your previous denial that it was so, show in what sense 
<A NAME="138"></A>it is alive: if, on the other hand, one has declared it to be inanimate 
<A NAME="139"></A>and the sophist has proved it to be animate, say how it is inanimate. Likewise 
<A NAME="140"></A>also in a case of amphiboly. If the argument depends on likeness of expression, 
<A NAME="141"></A>the opposite will be the solution. 'Could a man give what he has not got? 
<A NAME="142"></A>'No, not what he has not got; but he could give it in a way in which he 
<A NAME="143"></A>has not got it, e.g. one die by itself.' Does a man know either by learning 
<A NAME="144"></A>or by discovery each thing that he knows, singly? but not the things that 
<A NAME="145"></A>he knows, collectively.' Also a man treads, perhaps, on any thing he walks 
<A NAME="146"></A>through, but not on the time he walks through. Likewise also in the case 
<A NAME="147"></A>of the other examples.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="148"></A><B>Part 24</B>

<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>In dealing with arguments that depend on Accident, one and the 
<A NAME="150"></A>same solution meets all cases. For since it is indeterminate when an attribute 
<A NAME="151"></A>should be ascribed to a thing, in cases where it belongs to the accident 
<A NAME="152"></A>of the thing, and since in some cases it is generally agreed and people 
<A NAME="153"></A>admit that it belongs, while in others they deny that it need belong, we 
<A NAME="154"></A>should therefore, as soon as the conclusion has been drawn, say in answer 
<A NAME="155"></A>to them all alike, that there is no need for such an attribute to belong. 
<A NAME="156"></A>One must, however, be prepared to adduce an example of the kind of attribute 
<A NAME="157"></A>meant. All arguments such as the following depend upon Accident. 'Do you 
<A NAME="158"></A>know what I am going to ask you? you know the man who is approaching', 
<A NAME="159"></A>or 'the man in the mask'? 'Is the statue your work of art?' or 'Is the 
<A NAME="160"></A>dog your father?' 'Is the product of a small number with a small number 
<A NAME="161"></A>a small number?' For it is evident in all these cases that there is no 
<A NAME="162"></A>necessity for the attribute which is true of the thing's accident to be 
<A NAME="163"></A>true of the thing as well. For only to things that are indistinguishable 
<A NAME="164"></A>and one in essence is it generally agreed that all the same attributes 
<A NAME="165"></A>belong; whereas in the case of a good thing, to be good is not the same 
<A NAME="166"></A>as to be going to be the subject of a question; nor in the case of a man 
<A NAME="167"></A>approaching, or wearing a mask, is 'to be approaching' the same thing as 
<A NAME="168"></A>'to be Coriscus', so that suppose I know Coriscus, but do not know the 
<A NAME="169"></A>man who is approaching, it still isn't the case that I both know and do 
<A NAME="170"></A>not know the same man; nor, again, if this is mine and is also a work of 
<A NAME="171"></A>art, is it therefore my work of art, but my property or thing or something 
<A NAME="172"></A>else. (The solution is after the same manner in the other cases as 
<A NAME="173"></A>well.)
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>Some solve these refutations by demolishing the original proposition 
<A NAME="175"></A>asked: for they say that it is possible to know and not to know the same 
<A NAME="176"></A>thing, only not in the same respect: accordingly, when they don't know 
<A NAME="177"></A>the man who is coming towards them, but do know Corsicus, they assert that 
<A NAME="178"></A>they do know and don't know the same object, but not in the same respect. 
<A NAME="179"></A>Yet, as we have already remarked, the correction of arguments that depend 
<A NAME="180"></A>upon the same point ought to be the same, whereas this one will not stand 
<A NAME="181"></A>if one adopts the same principle in regard not to knowing something, but 
<A NAME="182"></A>to being, or to being is a in a certain state, e.g. suppose that X is father, 
<A NAME="183"></A>and is also yours: for if in some cases this is true and it is possible 
<A NAME="184"></A>to know and not to know the same thing, yet with that case the solution 
<A NAME="185"></A>stated has nothing to do. Certainly there is nothing to prevent the same 
<A NAME="186"></A>argument from having a number of flaws; but it is not the exposition of 
<A NAME="187"></A>any and every fault that constitutes a solution: for it is possible for 
<A NAME="188"></A>a man to show that a false conclusion has been proved, but not to show 
<A NAME="189"></A>on what it depends, e.g. in the case of Zeno's argument to prove that motion 
<A NAME="190"></A>is impossible. So that even if any one were to try to establish that this 
<A NAME="191"></A>doctrine is an impossible one, he still is mistaken, and even if he proved 
<A NAME="192"></A>his case ten thousand times over, still this is no solution of Zeno's argument: 
<A NAME="193"></A>for the solution was all along an exposition of false reasoning, showing 
<A NAME="194"></A>on what its falsity depends. If then he has not proved his case, or is 
<A NAME="195"></A>trying to establish even a true proposition, or a false one, in a false 
<A NAME="196"></A>manner, to point this out is a true solution. Possibly, indeed, the present 
<A NAME="197"></A>suggestion may very well apply in some cases: but in these cases, at any 
<A NAME="198"></A>rate, not even this would be generally agreed: for he knows both that Coriscus 
<A NAME="199"></A>is Coriscus and that the approaching figure is approaching. To know and 
<A NAME="200"></A>not to know the same thing is generally thought to be possible, when e.g. 
<A NAME="201"></A>one knows that X is white, but does not realize that he is musical: for 
<A NAME="202"></A>in that way he does know and not know the same thing, though not in the 
<A NAME="203"></A>same respect. But as to the approaching figure and Coriscus he knows both 
<A NAME="204"></A>that it is approaching and that he is Coriscus.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>A like mistake to that of those whom we have mentioned is that 
<A NAME="206"></A>of those who solve the proof that every number is a small number: for if, 
<A NAME="207"></A>when the conclusion is not proved, they pass this over and say that a conclusion 
<A NAME="208"></A>has been proved and is true, on the ground that every number is both great 
<A NAME="209"></A>and small, they make a mistake.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>Some people also use the principle of ambiguity to solve the aforesaid 
<A NAME="211"></A>reasonings, e.g. the proof that 'X is your father', or 'son', or 'slave'. 
<A NAME="212"></A>Yet it is evident that if the appearance a proof depends upon a plurality 
<A NAME="213"></A>of meanings, the term, or the expression in question, ought to bear a number 
<A NAME="214"></A>of literal senses, whereas no one speaks of A as being 'B's child' in the 
<A NAME="215"></A>literal sense, if B is the child's master, but the combination depends 
<A NAME="216"></A>upon Accident. 'Is A yours?' 'Yes.' 'And is A a child?' 'Yes.' 'Then the 
<A NAME="217"></A>child A is yours,' because he happens to be both yours and a child; but 
<A NAME="218"></A>he is not 'your child'.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>There is also the proof that 'something "of evils" is good'; for 
<A NAME="220"></A>wisdom is a 'knowledge "of evils"'. But the expression that this is 'of 
<A NAME="221"></A>so and-so' (='so-and-so's') has not a number of meanings: it means that 
<A NAME="222"></A>it is 'so-and-so's property'. We may suppose of course, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="223"></A>that it has a number of meanings-for we also say that man is 'of the animals', 
<A NAME="224"></A>though not their property; and also that any term related to 'evils' in 
<A NAME="225"></A>a way expressed by a genitive case is on that account a so-and-so 'of evils', 
<A NAME="226"></A>though it is not one of the evils-but in that case the apparently different 
<A NAME="227"></A>meanings seem to depend on whether the term is used relatively or absolutely. 
<A NAME="228"></A>'Yet it is conceivably possible to find a real ambiguity in the phrase 
<A NAME="229"></A>"Something of evils is good".' Perhaps, but not with regard to the phrase 
<A NAME="230"></A>in question. It would occur more nearly, suppose that 'A servant is good 
<A NAME="231"></A>of the wicked'; though perhaps it is not quite found even there: for a 
<A NAME="232"></A>thing may be 'good' and be 'X's' without being at the same time 'X's good'. 
<A NAME="233"></A>Nor is the saying that 'Man is of the animals' a phrase with a number of 
<A NAME="234"></A>meanings: for a phrase does not become possessed of a number of meanings 
<A NAME="235"></A>merely suppose we express it elliptically: for we express 'Give me the 
<A NAME="236"></A>Iliad' by quoting half a line of it, e.g. 'Give me "Sing, goddess, of the 
<A NAME="237"></A>wrath..."'

<A NAME="238"></A><B>Part 25</B>

<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>Those arguments which depend upon an expression that is valid of 
<A NAME="240"></A>a particular thing, or in a particular respect, or place, or manner, or 
<A NAME="241"></A>relation, and not valid absolutely, should be solved by considering the 
<A NAME="242"></A>conclusion in relation to its contradictory, to see if any of these things 
<A NAME="243"></A>can possibly have happened to it. For it is impossible for contraries and 
<A NAME="244"></A>opposites and an affirmative and a negative to belong to the same thing 
<A NAME="245"></A>absolutely; there is, however, nothing to prevent each from belonging in 
<A NAME="246"></A>a particular respect or relation or manner, or to prevent one of them from 
<A NAME="247"></A>belonging in a particular respect and the other absolutely. So that if 
<A NAME="248"></A>this one belongs absolutely and that one in a particular respect, there 
<A NAME="249"></A>is as yet no refutation. This is a feature one has to find in the conclusion 
<A NAME="250"></A>by examining it in comparison with its contradictory.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>All arguments of the following kind have this feature: 'Is it possible 
<A NAME="252"></A>for what is-not to be? "No." But, you see, it is something, despite its 
<A NAME="253"></A>not being.' Likewise also, Being will not be; for it will not he some particular 
<A NAME="254"></A>form of being. Is it possible for the same man at the same time to be a 
<A NAME="255"></A>keeper and a breaker of his oath?' 'Can the same man at the same time both 
<A NAME="256"></A>obey and disobey the same man?' Or isn't it the case that being something 
<A NAME="257"></A>in particular and Being are not the same? On the other hand, Not-being, 
<A NAME="258"></A>even if it be something, need not also have absolute 'being' as well. Nor 
<A NAME="259"></A>if a man keeps his oath in this particular instance or in this particular 
<A NAME="260"></A>respect, is he bound also to be a keeper of oaths absolutely, but he who 
<A NAME="261"></A>swears that he will break his oath, and then breaks it, keeps this particular 
<A NAME="262"></A>oath only; he is not a keeper of his oath: nor is the disobedient man 'obedient', 
<A NAME="263"></A>though he obeys one particular command. The argument is similar, also, 
<A NAME="264"></A>as regards the problem whether the same man can at the same time say what 
<A NAME="265"></A>is both false and true: but it appears to be a troublesome question because 
<A NAME="266"></A>it is not easy to see in which of the two connexions the word 'absolutely' 
<A NAME="267"></A>is to be rendered-with 'true' or with 'false'. There is, however, nothing 
<A NAME="268"></A>to prevent it from being false absolutely, though true in some particular 
<A NAME="269"></A>respect or relation, i.e. being true in some things, though not 'true' 
<A NAME="270"></A>absolutely. Likewise also in cases of some particular relation and place 
<A NAME="271"></A>and time. For all arguments of the following kind depend upon this.' Is 
<A NAME="272"></A>health, or wealth, a good thing?' 'Yes.' 'But to the fool who does not 
<A NAME="273"></A>use it aright it is not a good thing: therefore it is both good and not 
<A NAME="274"></A>good.' 'Is health, or political power, a good thing?' 'Yes. "But sometimes 
<A NAME="275"></A>it is not particularly good: therefore the same thing is both good and 
<A NAME="276"></A>not good to the same man.' Or rather there is nothing to prevent a thing, 
<A NAME="277"></A>though good absolutely, being not good to a particular man, or being good 
<A NAME="278"></A>to a particular man, and yet not good or here. 'Is that which the prudent 
<A NAME="279"></A>man would not wish, an evil?' 'Yes.' 'But to get rid of, he would not wish 
<A NAME="280"></A>the good: therefore the good is an evil.' But that is a mistake; for it 
<A NAME="281"></A>is not the same thing to say 'The good is an evil' and 'to get rid of the 
<A NAME="282"></A>good is an evil'. Likewise also the argument of the thief is mistaken. 
<A NAME="283"></A>For it is not the case that if the thief is an evil thing, acquiring things 
<A NAME="284"></A>is also evil: what he wishes, therefore, is not what is evil but what is 
<A NAME="285"></A>good; for to acquire something good is good. Also, disease is an evil thing, 
<A NAME="286"></A>but not to get rid of disease. 'Is the just preferable to the unjust, and 
<A NAME="287"></A>what takes place justly to what takes place unjustly? 'Yes.' 'But to to 
<A NAME="288"></A>be put to death unjustly is preferable.' 'Is it just that each should have 
<A NAME="289"></A>his own?' 'Yes.' 'But whatever decisions a man comes to on the strength 
<A NAME="290"></A>of his personal opinion, even if it be a false opinion, are valid in law: 
<A NAME="291"></A>therefore the same result is both just and unjust.' Also, should one decide 
<A NAME="292"></A>in favour of him who says what is unjust?' 'The former.' 'But you see, 
<A NAME="293"></A>it is just for the injured party to say fully the things he has suffered; 
<A NAME="294"></A>and these are fallacies. For because to suffer a thing unjustly is preferable, 
<A NAME="295"></A>unjust ways are not therefore preferable, though in this particular case 
<A NAME="296"></A>the unjust may very well be better than the just. Also, to have one's own 
<A NAME="297"></A>is just, while to have what is another's is not just: all the same, the 
<A NAME="298"></A>decision in question may very well be a just decision, whatever it be that 
<A NAME="299"></A>the opinion of the man who gave the decision supports: for because it is 
<A NAME="300"></A>just in this particular case or in this particular manner, it is not also 
<A NAME="301"></A>just absolutely. Likewise also, though things are unjust, there is nothing 
<A NAME="302"></A>to prevent the speaking of them being just: for because to speak of things 
<A NAME="303"></A>is just, there is no necessity that the things should be just, any more 
<A NAME="304"></A>than because to speak of things be of use, the things need be of use. Likewise 
<A NAME="305"></A>also in the case of what is just. So that it is not the case that because 
<A NAME="306"></A>the things spoken of are unjust, the victory goes to him who speaks unjust 
<A NAME="307"></A>things: for he speaks of things that are just to speak of, though absolutely, 
<A NAME="308"></A>i.e. to suffer, they are unjust.

<A NAME="309"></A><B>Part 26</B>

<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>Refutations that depend on the definition of a refutation must, 
<A NAME="311"></A>according to the plan sketched above, be met by comparing together the 
<A NAME="312"></A>conclusion with its contradictory, and seeing that it shall involve the 
<A NAME="313"></A>same attribute in the same respect and relation and manner and time. If 
<A NAME="314"></A>this additional question be put at the start, you should not admit that 
<A NAME="315"></A>it is impossible for the same thing to be both double and not double, but 
<A NAME="316"></A>grant that it is possible, only not in such a way as was agreed to constitute 
<A NAME="317"></A>a refutation of your case. All the following arguments depend upon a point 
<A NAME="318"></A>of that kind. 'Does a man who knows A to be A, know the thing called A?' 
<A NAME="319"></A>and in the same way, 'is one who is ignorant that A is A ignorant of the 
<A NAME="320"></A>thing called A?' 'Yes.' 'But one who knows that Coriscus is Coriscus might 
<A NAME="321"></A>be ignorant of the fact that he is musical, so that he both knows and is 
<A NAME="322"></A>ignorant of the same thing.' Is a thing four cubits long greater than a 
<A NAME="323"></A>thing three cubits long?' 'Yes.' 'But a thing might grow from three to 
<A NAME="324"></A>four cubits in length; 'now what is 'greater' is greater than a 'less': 
<A NAME="325"></A>accordingly the thing in question will be both greater and less than itself 
<A NAME="326"></A>in the same respect.

<A NAME="327"></A><B>Part 27</B>

<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>As to refutations that depend on begging and assuming the original 
<A NAME="329"></A>point to be proved, suppose the nature of the question to be obvious, one 
<A NAME="330"></A>should not grant it, even though it be a view generally held, but should 
<A NAME="331"></A>tell him the truth. Suppose, however, that it escapes one, then, thanks 
<A NAME="332"></A>to the badness of arguments of that kind, one should make one's error recoil 
<A NAME="333"></A>upon the questioner, and say that he has brought no argument: for a refutation 
<A NAME="334"></A>must be proved independently of the original point. Secondly, one should 
<A NAME="335"></A>say that the point was granted under the impression that he intended not 
<A NAME="336"></A>to use it as a premiss, but to reason against it, in the opposite way from 
<A NAME="337"></A>that adopted in refutations on side issues.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="338"></A><B>Part 28</B>

<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>Also, those refutations that bring one to their conclusion through 
<A NAME="340"></A>the consequent you should show up in the course of the argument itself. 
<A NAME="341"></A>The mode in which consequences follow is twofold. For the argument either 
<A NAME="342"></A>is that as the universal follows on its particular-as (e.g.) 'animal' follows 
<A NAME="343"></A>from 'man'-so does the particular on its universal: for the claim is made 
<A NAME="344"></A>that if A is always found with B, then B also is always found with A. Or 
<A NAME="345"></A>else it proceeds by way of the opposites of the terms involved: for if 
<A NAME="346"></A>A follows B, it is claimed that A's opposite will follow B's opposite. 
<A NAME="347"></A>On this latter claim the argument of Melissus also depends: for he claims 
<A NAME="348"></A>that because that which has come to be has a beginning, that which has 
<A NAME="349"></A>not come to be has none, so that if the heaven has not come to be, it is 
<A NAME="350"></A>also eternal. But that is not so; for the sequence is vice 
<A NAME="351"></A>versa.

<A NAME="352"></A><B>Part 29</B>

<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>In the case of any refutations whose reasoning depends on some 
<A NAME="354"></A>addition, look and see if upon its subtraction the absurdity follows none 
<A NAME="355"></A>the less: and then if so, the answerer should point this out, and say that 
<A NAME="356"></A>he granted the addition not because he really thought it, but for the sake 
<A NAME="357"></A>of the argument, whereas the questioner has not used it for the purpose 
<A NAME="358"></A>of his argument at all.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="359"></A><B>Part 30</B>

<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>To meet those refutations which make several questions into one, 
<A NAME="361"></A>one should draw a distinction between them straight away at the start. 
<A NAME="362"></A>For a question must be single to which there is a single answer, so that 
<A NAME="363"></A>one must not affirm or deny several things of one thing, nor one thing 
<A NAME="364"></A>of many, but one of one. But just as in the case of ambiguous terms, an 
<A NAME="365"></A>attribute belongs to a term sometimes in both its senses, and sometimes 
<A NAME="366"></A>in neither, so that a simple answer does one, as it happens, no harm despite 
<A NAME="367"></A>the fact that the question is not simple, so it is in these cases of double 
<A NAME="368"></A>questions too. Whenever, then, the several attributes belong to the one 
<A NAME="369"></A>subject, or the one to the many, the man who gives a simple answer encounters 
<A NAME="370"></A>no obstacle even though he has committed this mistake: but whenever an 
<A NAME="371"></A>attribute belongs to one subject but not to the other, or there is a question 
<A NAME="372"></A>of a number of attributes belonging to a number of subjects and in one 
<A NAME="373"></A>sense both belong to both, while in another sense, again, they do not, 
<A NAME="374"></A>then there is trouble, so that one must beware of this. Thus (e.g.) in 
<A NAME="375"></A>the following arguments: Supposing to be good and B evil, you will, if 
<A NAME="376"></A>you give a single answer about both, be compelled to say that it is true 
<A NAME="377"></A>to call these good, and that it is true to call them evil and likewise 
<A NAME="378"></A>to call them neither good nor evil (for each of them has not each character), 
<A NAME="379"></A>so that the same thing will be both good and evil and neither good nor 
<A NAME="380"></A>evil. Also, since everything is the same as itself and different from anything 
<A NAME="381"></A>else, inasmuch as the man who answers double questions simply can be made 
<A NAME="382"></A>to say that several things are 'the same' not as other things but 'as themselves', 
<A NAME="383"></A>and also that they are different from themselves, it follows that the same 
<A NAME="384"></A>things must be both the same as and different from themselves. Moreover, 
<A NAME="385"></A>if what is good becomes evil while what is evil is good, then they must 
<A NAME="386"></A>both become two. So of two unequal things each being equal to itself, it 
<A NAME="387"></A>will follow that they are both equal and unequal to 
<A NAME="388"></A>themselves.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>Now these refutations fall into the province of other solutions 
<A NAME="390"></A>as well: for 'both' and 'all' have more than one meaning, so that the resulting 
<A NAME="391"></A>affirmation and denial of the same thing does not occur, except verbally: 
<A NAME="392"></A>and this is not what we meant by a refutation. But it is clear that if 
<A NAME="393"></A>there be not put a single question on a number of points, but the answerer 
<A NAME="394"></A>has affirmed or denied one attribute only of one subject only, the absurdity 
<A NAME="395"></A>will not come to pass.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="396"></A><B>Part 31</B>

<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>With regard to those who draw one into repeating the same thing 
<A NAME="398"></A>a number of times, it is clear that one must not grant that predications 
<A NAME="399"></A>of relative terms have any meaning in abstraction by themselves, e.g. that 
<A NAME="400"></A>'double' is a significant term apart from the whole phrase 'double of half' 
<A NAME="401"></A>merely on the ground that it figures in it. For ten figures in 'ten minus 
<A NAME="402"></A>one' and in 'not do', and generally the affirmation in the negation; but 
<A NAME="403"></A>for all that, suppose any one were to say, 'This is not white', he does 
<A NAME="404"></A>not say that it is white. The bare word 'double', one may perhaps say, 
<A NAME="405"></A>has not even any meaning at all, any more than has 'the' in 'the half': 
<A NAME="406"></A>and even if it has a meaning, yet it has not the same meaning as in the 
<A NAME="407"></A>combination. Nor is 'knowledge' the same thing in a specific branch of 
<A NAME="408"></A>it (suppose it, e.g. to be 'medical knowledge') as it is in general: for 
<A NAME="409"></A>in general it was the 'knowledge of the knowable'. In the case of terms 
<A NAME="410"></A>that are predicated of the terms through which they are defined, you should 
<A NAME="411"></A>say the same thing, that the term defined is not the same in abstraction 
<A NAME="412"></A>as it is in the whole phrase. For 'concave' has a general meaning which 
<A NAME="413"></A>is the same in the case of a snub nose, and of a bandy leg, but when added 
<A NAME="414"></A>to either substantive nothing prevents it from differentiating its meaning; 
<A NAME="415"></A>in fact it bears one sense as applied to the nose, and another as applied 
<A NAME="416"></A>to the leg: for in the former connexion it means 'snub' and in the latter 
<A NAME="417"></A>'bandyshaped'; i.e. it makes no difference whether you say 'a snub nose' 
<A NAME="418"></A>or 'a concave nose'. Moreover, the expression must not be granted in the 
<A NAME="419"></A>nominative case: for it is a falsehood. For snubness is not a concave nose 
<A NAME="420"></A>but something (e.g. an affection) belonging to a nose: hence, there is 
<A NAME="421"></A>no absurdity in supposing that the snub nose is a nose possessing the concavity 
<A NAME="422"></A>that belongs to a nose.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="423"></A><B>Part 32</B>

<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>With regard to solecisms, we have previously said what it is that 
<A NAME="425"></A>appears to bring them about; the method of their solution will be clear 
<A NAME="426"></A>in the course of the arguments themselves. Solecism is the result aimed 
<A NAME="427"></A>at in all arguments of the following kind: 'Is a thing truly that which 
<A NAME="428"></A>you truly call it?' 'Yes'. 'But, speaking of a stone, you call him real: 
<A NAME="429"></A>therefore of a stone it follows that "him is real".' No: rather, talking 
<A NAME="430"></A>of a stone means not saying which' but 'whom', and not 'that' but 'him'. 
<A NAME="431"></A>If, then, any one were to ask, 'Is a stone him whom you truly call him?' 
<A NAME="432"></A>he would be generally thought not to be speaking good Greek, any more than 
<A NAME="433"></A>if he were to ask, 'Is he what you call her?' Speak in this way of a 'stick' 
<A NAME="434"></A>or any neuter word, and the difference does not break out. For this reason, 
<A NAME="435"></A>also, no solecism is incurred, suppose any one asks, 'Is a thing what you 
<A NAME="436"></A>say it to be?' 'Yes'. 'But, speaking of a stick, you call it real: therefore, 
<A NAME="437"></A>of a stick it follows that it is real.' 'Stone', however, and 'he' have 
<A NAME="438"></A>masculine designations. Now suppose some one were to ask, 'Can "he" be 
<A NAME="439"></A>a she" (a female)?', and then again, 'Well, but is not he Coriscus?' and 
<A NAME="440"></A>then were to say, 'Then he is a "she",' he has not proved the solecism, 
<A NAME="441"></A>even if the name 'Coriscus' does signify a 'she', if, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="442"></A>the answerer does not grant this: this point must be put as an additional 
<A NAME="443"></A>question: while if neither is it the fact nor does he grant it, then the 
<A NAME="444"></A>sophist has not proved his case either in fact or as against the person 
<A NAME="445"></A>he has been questioning. In like manner, then, in the above instance as 
<A NAME="446"></A>well it must be definitely put that 'he' means the stone. If, however, 
<A NAME="447"></A>this neither is so nor is granted, the conclusion must not be stated: though 
<A NAME="448"></A>it follows apparently, because the case (the accusative), that is really 
<A NAME="449"></A>unlike, appears to be like the nominative. 'Is it true to say that this 
<A NAME="450"></A>object is what you call it by name?' 'Yes'. 'But you call it by the name 
<A NAME="451"></A>of a shield: this object therefore is "of a shield".' No: not necessarily, 
<A NAME="452"></A>because the meaning of 'this object' is not 'of a shield' but 'a shield': 
<A NAME="453"></A>'of a shield' would be the meaning of 'this object's'. Nor again if 'He 
<A NAME="454"></A>is what you call him by name', while 'the name you call him by is Cleon's', 
<A NAME="455"></A>is he therefore 'Cleon's': for he is not 'Cleon's', for what was said was 
<A NAME="456"></A>that 'He, not his, is what I call him by name'. For the question, if put 
<A NAME="457"></A>in the latter way, would not even be Greek. 'Do you know this?' 'Yes.' 
<A NAME="458"></A>'But this is he: therefore you know he'. No: rather 'this' has not the 
<A NAME="459"></A>same meaning in 'Do you know this?' as in 'This is a stone'; in the first 
<A NAME="460"></A>it stands for an accusative, in the second for a nominative case. 'When 
<A NAME="461"></A>you have understanding of anything, do you understand it?' 'Yes.' 'But 
<A NAME="462"></A>you have understanding of a stone: therefore you understand of a stone.' 
<A NAME="463"></A>No: the one phrase is in the genitive, 'of a stone', while the other is 
<A NAME="464"></A>in the accusative, 'a stone': and what was granted was that 'you understand 
<A NAME="465"></A>that, not of that, of which you have understanding', so that you understand 
<A NAME="466"></A>not 'of a stone', but 'the stone'.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>Thus that arguments of this kind do not prove solecism but merely 
<A NAME="468"></A>appear to do so, and both why they so appear and how you should meet them, 
<A NAME="469"></A>is clear from what has been said.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="470"></A><B>Part 33</B>

<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>We must also observe that of all the arguments aforesaid it is 
<A NAME="472"></A>easier with some to see why and where the reasoning leads the hearer astray, 
<A NAME="473"></A>while with others it is more difficult, though often they are the same 
<A NAME="474"></A>arguments as the former. For we must call an argument the same if it depends 
<A NAME="475"></A>upon the same point; but the same argument is apt to be thought by some 
<A NAME="476"></A>to depend on diction, by others on accident, and by others on something 
<A NAME="477"></A>else, because each of them, when worked with different terms, is not so 
<A NAME="478"></A>clear as it was. Accordingly, just as in fallacies that depend on ambiguity, 
<A NAME="479"></A>which are generally thought to be the silliest form of fallacy, some are 
<A NAME="480"></A>clear even to the man in the street (for humorous phrases nearly all depend 
<A NAME="481"></A>on diction; e.g. 'The man got the cart down from the stand'; and 'Where 
<A NAME="482"></A>are you bound?' 'To the yard arm'; and 'Which cow will calve afore?' 'Neither, 
<A NAME="483"></A>but both behind;' and 'Is the North wind clear?' 'No, indeed; for it has 
<A NAME="484"></A>murdered the beggar and the merchant." Is he a Good enough-King?' 'No, 
<A NAME="485"></A>indeed; a Rob-son': and so with the great majority of the rest as well), 
<A NAME="486"></A>while others appear to elude the most expert (and it is a symptom of this 
<A NAME="487"></A>that they often fight about their terms, e.g. whether the meaning of 'Being' 
<A NAME="488"></A>and 'One' is the same in all their applications or different; for some 
<A NAME="489"></A>think that 'Being' and 'One' mean the same; while others solve the argument 
<A NAME="490"></A>of Zeno and Parmenides by asserting that 'One' and 'Being' are used in 
<A NAME="491"></A>a number of senses), likewise also as regards fallacies of Accident and 
<A NAME="492"></A>each of the other types, some of the arguments will be easier to see while 
<A NAME="493"></A>others are more difficult; also to grasp to which class a fallacy belongs, 
<A NAME="494"></A>and whether it is a refutation or not a refutation, is not equally easy 
<A NAME="495"></A>in all cases.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>An incisive argument is one which produces the greatest perplexity: 
<A NAME="497"></A>for this is the one with the sharpest fang. Now perplexity is twofold, 
<A NAME="498"></A>one which occurs in reasoned arguments, respecting which of the propositions 
<A NAME="499"></A>asked one is to demolish, and the other in contentious arguments, respecting 
<A NAME="500"></A>the manner in which one is to assent to what is propounded. Therefore it 
<A NAME="501"></A>is in syllogistic arguments that the more incisive ones produce the keenest 
<A NAME="502"></A>heart-searching. Now a syllogistic argument is most incisive if from premisses 
<A NAME="503"></A>that are as generally accepted as possible it demolishes a conclusion that 
<A NAME="504"></A>is accepted as generally as possible. For the one argument, if the contradictory 
<A NAME="505"></A>is changed about, makes all the resulting syllogisms alike in character: 
<A NAME="506"></A>for always from premisses that are generally accepted it will prove a conclusion, 
<A NAME="507"></A>negative or positive as the case may be, that is just as generally accepted; 
<A NAME="508"></A>and therefore one is bound to feel perplexed. An argument, then, of this 
<A NAME="509"></A>kind is the most incisive, viz. the one that puts its conclusion on all 
<A NAME="510"></A>fours with the propositions asked; and second comes the one that argues 
<A NAME="511"></A>from premisses, all of which are equally convincing: for this will produce 
<A NAME="512"></A>an equal perplexity as to what kind of premiss, of those asked, one should 
<A NAME="513"></A>demolish. Herein is a difficulty: for one must demolish something, but 
<A NAME="514"></A>what one must demolish is uncertain. Of contentious arguments, on the other 
<A NAME="515"></A>hand, the most incisive is the one which, in the first place, is characterized 
<A NAME="516"></A>by an initial uncertainty whether it has been properly reasoned or not; 
<A NAME="517"></A>and also whether the solution depends on a false premiss or on the drawing 
<A NAME="518"></A>of a distinction; while, of the rest, the second place is held by that 
<A NAME="519"></A>whose solution clearly depends upon a distinction or a demolition, and 
<A NAME="520"></A>yet it does not reveal clearly which it is of the premisses asked, whose 
<A NAME="521"></A>demolition, or the drawing of a distinction within it, will bring the solution 
<A NAME="522"></A>about, but even leaves it vague whether it is on the conclusion or on one 
<A NAME="523"></A>of the premisses that the deception depends.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>Now sometimes an argument which has not been properly reasoned 
<A NAME="525"></A>is silly, supposing the assumptions required to be extremely contrary to 
<A NAME="526"></A>the general view or false; but sometimes it ought not to be held in contempt. 
<A NAME="527"></A>For whenever some question is left out, of the kind that concerns both 
<A NAME="528"></A>the subject and the nerve of the argument, the reasoning that has both 
<A NAME="529"></A>failed to secure this as well, and also failed to reason properly, is silly; 
<A NAME="530"></A>but when what is omitted is some extraneous question, then it is by no 
<A NAME="531"></A>means to be lightly despised, but the argument is quite respectable, though 
<A NAME="532"></A>the questioner has not put his questions well.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>Just as it is possible to bring a solution sometimes against the 
<A NAME="534"></A>argument, at others against the questioner and his mode of questioning, 
<A NAME="535"></A>and at others against neither of these, likewise also it is possible to 
<A NAME="536"></A>marshal one's questions and reasoning both against the thesis, and against 
<A NAME="537"></A>the answerer and against the time, whenever the solution requires a longer 
<A NAME="538"></A>time to examine than the period available.

<A NAME="539"></A><B>Part 34</B>

<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>As to the number, then, and kind of sources whence fallacies arise 
<A NAME="541"></A>in discussion, and how we are to show that our opponent is committing a 
<A NAME="542"></A>fallacy and make him utter paradoxes; moreover, by the use of what materials 
<A NAME="543"></A>solescism is brought about, and how to question and what is the way to 
<A NAME="544"></A>arrange the questions; moreover, as to the question what use is served 
<A NAME="545"></A>by all arguments of this kind, and concerning the answerer's part, both 
<A NAME="546"></A>as a whole in general, and in particular how to solve arguments and solecisms-on 
<A NAME="547"></A>all these things let the foregoing discussion suffice. It remains to recall 
<A NAME="548"></A>our original proposal and to bring our discussion to a close with a few 
<A NAME="549"></A>words upon it.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>Our programme was, then, to discover some faculty of reasoning 
<A NAME="551"></A>about any theme put before us from the most generally accepted premisses 
<A NAME="552"></A>that there are. For that is the essential task of the art of discussion 
<A NAME="553"></A>(dialectic) and of examination (peirastic). Inasmuch, however, as it is 
<A NAME="554"></A>annexed to it, on account of the near presence of the art of sophistry 
<A NAME="555"></A>(sophistic), not only to be able to conduct an examination dialectically 
<A NAME="556"></A>but also with a show of knowledge, we therefore proposed for our treatise 
<A NAME="557"></A>not only the aforesaid aim of being able to exact an account of any view, 
<A NAME="558"></A>but also the aim of ensuring that in standing up to an argument we shall 
<A NAME="559"></A>defend our thesis in the same manner by means of views as generally held 
<A NAME="560"></A>as possible. The reason of this we have explained; for this, too, was why 
<A NAME="561"></A>Socrates used to ask questions and not to answer them; for he used to confess 
<A NAME="562"></A>that he did not know. We have made clear, in the course of what precedes, 
<A NAME="563"></A>the number both of the points with reference to which, and of the materials 
<A NAME="564"></A>from which, this will be accomplished, and also from what sources we can 
<A NAME="565"></A>become well supplied with these: we have shown, moreover, how to question 
<A NAME="566"></A>or arrange the questioning as a whole, and the problems concerning the 
<A NAME="567"></A>answers and solutions to be used against the reasonings of the questioner. 
<A NAME="568"></A>We have also cleared up the problems concerning all other matters that 
<A NAME="569"></A>belong to the same inquiry into arguments. In addition to this we have 
<A NAME="570"></A>been through the subject of Fallacies, as we have already stated 
<A NAME="571"></A>above.
<A NAME="572"></A><BR><BR>That our programme, then, has been adequately completed is clear. 
<A NAME="573"></A>But we must not omit to notice what has happened in regard to this inquiry. 
<A NAME="574"></A>For in the case of all discoveries the results of previous labours that 
<A NAME="575"></A>have been handed down from others have been advanced bit by bit by those 
<A NAME="576"></A>who have taken them on, whereas the original discoveries generally make 
<A NAME="577"></A>advance that is small at first though much more useful than the development 
<A NAME="578"></A>which later springs out of them. For it may be that in everything, as the 
<A NAME="579"></A>saying is, 'the first start is the main part': and for this reason also 
<A NAME="580"></A>it is the most difficult; for in proportion as it is most potent in its 
<A NAME="581"></A>influence, so it is smallest in its compass and therefore most difficult 
<A NAME="582"></A>to see: whereas when this is once discovered, it is easier to add and develop 
<A NAME="583"></A>the remainder in connexion with it. This is in fact what has happened in 
<A NAME="584"></A>regard to rhetorical speeches and to practically all the other arts: for 
<A NAME="585"></A>those who discovered the beginnings of them advanced them in all only a 
<A NAME="586"></A>little way, whereas the celebrities of to-day are the heirs (so to speak) 
<A NAME="587"></A>of a long succession of men who have advanced them bit by bit, and so have 
<A NAME="588"></A>developed them to their present form, Tisias coming next after the first 
<A NAME="589"></A>founders, then Thrasymachus after Tisias, and Theodorus next to him, while 
<A NAME="590"></A>several people have made their several contributions to it: and therefore 
<A NAME="591"></A>it is not to be wondered at that the art has attained considerable dimensions. 
<A NAME="592"></A>Of this inquiry, on the other hand, it was not the case that part of the 
<A NAME="593"></A>work had been thoroughly done before, while part had not. Nothing existed 
<A NAME="594"></A>at all. For the training given by the paid professors of contentious arguments 
<A NAME="595"></A>was like the treatment of the matter by Gorgias. For they used to hand 
<A NAME="596"></A>out speeches to be learned by heart, some rhetorical, others in the form 
<A NAME="597"></A>of question and answer, each side supposing that their arguments on either 
<A NAME="598"></A>side generally fall among them. And therefore the teaching they gave their 
<A NAME="599"></A>pupils was ready but rough. For they used to suppose that they trained 
<A NAME="600"></A>people by imparting to them not the art but its products, as though any 
<A NAME="601"></A>one professing that he would impart a form of knowledge to obviate any 
<A NAME="602"></A>pain in the feet, were then not to teach a man the art of shoe-making or 
<A NAME="603"></A>the sources whence he can acquire anything of the kind, but were to present 
<A NAME="604"></A>him with several kinds of shoes of all sorts: for he has helped him to 
<A NAME="605"></A>meet his need, but has not imparted an art to him. Moreover, on the subject 
<A NAME="606"></A>of Rhetoric there exists much that has been said long ago, whereas on the 
<A NAME="607"></A>subject of reasoning we had nothing else of an earlier date to speak of 
<A NAME="608"></A>at all, but were kept at work for a long time in experimental researches. 
<A NAME="609"></A>If, then, it seems to you after inspection that, such being the situation 
<A NAME="610"></A>as it existed at the start, our investigation is in a satisfactory condition 
<A NAME="611"></A>compared with the other inquiries that have been developed by tradition, 
<A NAME="612"></A>there must remain for all of you, or for our students, the task of extending 
<A NAME="613"></A>us your pardon for the shortcomings of the inquiry, and for the discoveries 
<A NAME="614"></A>thereof your warm thanks.
