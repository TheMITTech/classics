<A NAME="10"></A>1
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Let us speak next of liberality. It seems to be the mean with regard 
<A NAME="12"></A>to wealth; for the liberal man is praised not in respect of military matters, 
<A NAME="13"></A>nor of those in respect of which the temrate man is praised, nor of judicial 
<A NAME="14"></A>decisions, but with regard to the giving and taking of wealth, and especially 
<A NAME="15"></A>in respect of giving. Now by 'wealth' we mean all the things whose value 
<A NAME="16"></A>is measured by money. Further, prodigality and meanness are excesses and 
<A NAME="17"></A>defects with regard to wealth; and meanness we always impute to those who 
<A NAME="18"></A>care more than they ought for wealth, but we sometimes apply the word 'prodigality' 
<A NAME="19"></A>in a complex sense; for we call those men prodigals who are incontinent 
<A NAME="20"></A>and spend money on self-indulgence. Hence also they are thought the poorest 
<A NAME="21"></A>characters; for they combine more vices than one. Therefore the application 
<A NAME="22"></A>of the word to them is not its proper use; for a 'prodigal' means a man 
<A NAME="23"></A>who has a single evil quality, that of wasting his substance; since a prodigal 
<A NAME="24"></A>is one who is being ruined by his own fault, and the wasting of substance 
<A NAME="25"></A>is thought to be a sort of ruining of oneself, life being held to depend 
<A NAME="26"></A>on possession of substance.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>This, then, is the sense in which we take the word 'prodigality'. 
<A NAME="28"></A>Now the things that have a use may be used either well or badly; and riches 
<A NAME="29"></A>is a useful thing; and everything is used best by the man who has the virtue 
<A NAME="30"></A>concerned with it; riches, therefore, will be used best by the man who 
<A NAME="31"></A>has the virtue concerned with wealth; and this is the liberal man. Now 
<A NAME="32"></A>spending and giving seem to be the using of wealth; taking and keeping 
<A NAME="33"></A>rather the possession of it. Hence it is more the mark of the liberal man 
<A NAME="34"></A>to give to the right people than to take from the right sources and not 
<A NAME="35"></A>to take from the wrong. For it is more characteristic of virtue to do good 
<A NAME="36"></A>than to have good done to one, and more characteristic to do what is noble 
<A NAME="37"></A>than not to do what is base; and it is not hard to see that giving implies 
<A NAME="38"></A>doing good and doing what is noble, and taking implies having good done 
<A NAME="39"></A>to one or not acting basely. And gratitude is felt towards him who gives, 
<A NAME="40"></A>not towards him who does not take, and praise also is bestowed more on 
<A NAME="41"></A>him. It is easier, also, not to take than to give; for men are apter to 
<A NAME="42"></A>give away their own too little than to take what is another's. Givers, 
<A NAME="43"></A>too, are called liberal; but those who do not take are not praised for 
<A NAME="44"></A>liberality but rather for justice; while those who take are hardly praised 
<A NAME="45"></A>at all. And the liberal are almost the most loved of all virtuous characters, 
<A NAME="46"></A>since they are useful; and this depends on their giving.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>Now virtuous actions are noble and done for the sake of the noble. 
<A NAME="48"></A>Therefore the liberal man, like other virtuous men, will give for the sake 
<A NAME="49"></A>of the noble, and rightly; for he will give to the right people, the right 
<A NAME="50"></A>amounts, and at the right time, with all the other qualifications that 
<A NAME="51"></A>accompany right giving; and that too with pleasure or without pain; for 
<A NAME="52"></A>that which is virtuous is pleasant or free from pain-least of all will 
<A NAME="53"></A>it be painful. But he who gives to the wrong people or not for the sake 
<A NAME="54"></A>of the noble but for some other cause, will be called not liberal but by 
<A NAME="55"></A>some other name. Nor is he liberal who gives with pain; for he would prefer 
<A NAME="56"></A>the wealth to the noble act, and this is not characteristic of a liberal 
<A NAME="57"></A>man. But no more will the liberal man take from wrong sources; for such 
<A NAME="58"></A>taking is not characteristic of the man who sets no store by wealth. Nor 
<A NAME="59"></A>will he be a ready asker; for it is not characteristic of a man who confers 
<A NAME="60"></A>benefits to accept them lightly. But he will take from the right sources, 
<A NAME="61"></A>e.g. from his own possessions, not as something noble but as a necessity, 
<A NAME="62"></A>that he may have something to give. Nor will he neglect his own property, 
<A NAME="63"></A>since he wishes by means of this to help others. And he will refrain from 
<A NAME="64"></A>giving to anybody and everybody, that he may have something to give to 
<A NAME="65"></A>the right people, at the right time, and where it is noble to do so. It 
<A NAME="66"></A>is highly characteristic of a liberal man also to go to excess in giving, 
<A NAME="67"></A>so that he leaves too little for himself; for it is the nature of a liberal 
<A NAME="68"></A>man not to look to himself. The term 'liberality' is used relatively to 
<A NAME="69"></A>a man's substance; for liberality resides not in the multitude of the gifts 
<A NAME="70"></A>but in the state of character of the giver, and this is relative to the 
<A NAME="71"></A>giver's substance. There is therefore nothing to prevent the man who gives 
<A NAME="72"></A>less from being the more liberal man, if he has less to give those are 
<A NAME="73"></A>thought to be more liberal who have not made their wealth but inherited 
<A NAME="74"></A>it; for in the first place they have no experience of want, and secondly 
<A NAME="75"></A>all men are fonder of their own productions, as are parents and poets. 
<A NAME="76"></A>It is not easy for the liberal man to be rich, since he is not apt either 
<A NAME="77"></A>at taking or at keeping, but at giving away, and does not value wealth 
<A NAME="78"></A>for its own sake but as a means to giving. Hence comes the charge that 
<A NAME="79"></A>is brought against fortune, that those who deserve riches most get it least. 
<A NAME="80"></A>But it is not unreasonable that it should turn out so; for he cannot have 
<A NAME="81"></A>wealth, any more than anything else, if he does not take pains to have 
<A NAME="82"></A>it. Yet he will not give to the wrong people nor at the wrong time, and 
<A NAME="83"></A>so on; for he would no longer be acting in accordance with liberality, 
<A NAME="84"></A>and if he spent on these objects he would have nothing to spend on the 
<A NAME="85"></A>right objects. For, as has been said, he is liberal who spends according 
<A NAME="86"></A>to his substance and on the right objects; and he who exceeds is prodigal. 
<A NAME="87"></A>Hence we do not call despots prodigal; for it is thought not easy for them 
<A NAME="88"></A>to give and spend beyond the amount of their possessions. Liberality, then, 
<A NAME="89"></A>being a mean with regard to giving and taking of wealth, the liberal man 
<A NAME="90"></A>will both give and spend the right amounts and on the right objects, alike 
<A NAME="91"></A>in small things and in great, and that with pleasure; he will also take 
<A NAME="92"></A>the right amounts and from the right sources. For, the virtue being a mean 
<A NAME="93"></A>with regard to both, he will do both as he ought; since this sort of taking 
<A NAME="94"></A>accompanies proper giving, and that which is not of this sort is contrary 
<A NAME="95"></A>to it, and accordingly the giving and taking that accompany each other 
<A NAME="96"></A>are present together in the same man, while the contrary kinds evidently 
<A NAME="97"></A>are not. But if he happens to spend in a manner contrary to what is right 
<A NAME="98"></A>and noble, he will be pained, but moderately and as he ought; for it is 
<A NAME="99"></A>the mark of virtue both to be pleased and to be pained at the right objects 
<A NAME="100"></A>and in the right way. Further, the liberal man is easy to deal with in 
<A NAME="101"></A>money matters; for he can be got the better of, since he sets no store 
<A NAME="102"></A>by money, and is more annoyed if he has not spent something that he ought 
<A NAME="103"></A>than pained if he has spent something that he ought not, and does not agree 
<A NAME="104"></A>with the saying of Simonides.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>The prodigal errs in these respects also; for he is neither pleased 
<A NAME="106"></A>nor pained at the right things or in the right way; this will be more evident 
<A NAME="107"></A>as we go on. We have said that prodigality and meanness are excesses and 
<A NAME="108"></A>deficiencies, and in two things, in giving and in taking; for we include 
<A NAME="109"></A>spending under giving. Now prodigality exceeds in giving and not taking, 
<A NAME="110"></A>while meanness falls short in giving, and exceeds in taking, except in 
<A NAME="111"></A>small things.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>The characteristics of prodigality are not often combined; for 
<A NAME="113"></A>it is not easy to give to all if you take from none; private persons soon 
<A NAME="114"></A>exhaust their substance with giving, and it is to these that the name of 
<A NAME="115"></A>prodigals is applied- though a man of this sort would seem to be in no 
<A NAME="116"></A>small degree better than a mean man. For he is easily cured both by age 
<A NAME="117"></A>and by poverty, and thus he may move towards the middle state. For he has 
<A NAME="118"></A>the characteristics of the liberal man, since he both gives and refrains 
<A NAME="119"></A>from taking, though he does neither of these in the right manner or well. 
<A NAME="120"></A>Therefore if he were brought to do so by habituation or in some other way, 
<A NAME="121"></A>he would be liberal; for he will then give to the right people, and will 
<A NAME="122"></A>not take from the wrong sources. This is why he is thought to have not 
<A NAME="123"></A>a bad character; it is not the mark of a wicked or ignoble man to go to 
<A NAME="124"></A>excess in giving and not taking, but only of a foolish one. The man who 
<A NAME="125"></A>is prodigal in this way is thought much better than the mean man both for 
<A NAME="126"></A>the aforesaid reasons and because he benefits many while the other benefits 
<A NAME="127"></A>no one, not even himself.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>But most prodigal people, as has been said, also take from the 
<A NAME="129"></A>wrong sources, and are in this respect mean. They become apt to take because 
<A NAME="130"></A>they wish to spend and cannot do this easily; for their possessions soon 
<A NAME="131"></A>run short. Thus they are forced to provide means from some other source. 
<A NAME="132"></A>At the same time, because they care nothing for honour, they take recklessly 
<A NAME="133"></A>and from any source; for they have an appetite for giving, and they do 
<A NAME="134"></A>not mind how or from what source. Hence also their giving is not liberal; 
<A NAME="135"></A>for it is not noble, nor does it aim at nobility, nor is it done in the 
<A NAME="136"></A>right way; sometimes they make rich those who should be poor, and will 
<A NAME="137"></A>give nothing to people of respectable character, and much to flatterers 
<A NAME="138"></A>or those who provide them with some other pleasure. Hence also most of 
<A NAME="139"></A>them are self-indulgent; for they spend lightly and waste money on their 
<A NAME="140"></A>indulgences, and incline towards pleasures because they do not live with 
<A NAME="141"></A>a view to what is noble.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>The prodigal man, then, turns into what we have described if he 
<A NAME="143"></A>is left untutored, but if he is treated with care he will arrive at the 
<A NAME="144"></A>intermediate and right state. But meanness is both incurable (for old age 
<A NAME="145"></A>and every disability is thought to make men mean) and more innate in men 
<A NAME="146"></A>than prodigality; for most men are fonder of getting money than of giving. 
<A NAME="147"></A>It also extends widely, and is multiform, since there seem to be many kinds 
<A NAME="148"></A>of meanness.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>For it consists in two things, deficiency in giving and excess 
<A NAME="150"></A>in taking, and is not found complete in all men but is sometimes divided; 
<A NAME="151"></A>some men go to excess in taking, others fall short in giving. Those who 
<A NAME="152"></A>are called by such names as 'miserly', 'close', 'stingy', all fall short 
<A NAME="153"></A>in giving, but do not covet the possessions of others nor wish to get them. 
<A NAME="154"></A>In some this is due to a sort of honesty and avoidance of what is disgraceful 
<A NAME="155"></A>(for some seem, or at least profess, to hoard their money for this reason, 
<A NAME="156"></A>that they may not some day be forced to do something disgraceful; to this 
<A NAME="157"></A>class belong the cheeseparer and every one of the sort; he is so called 
<A NAME="158"></A>from his excess of unwillingness to give anything); while others again 
<A NAME="159"></A>keep their hands off the property of others from fear, on the ground that 
<A NAME="160"></A>it is not easy, if one takes the property of others oneself, to avoid having 
<A NAME="161"></A>one's own taken by them; they are therefore content neither to take nor 
<A NAME="162"></A>to give.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>Others again exceed in respect of taking by taking anything and 
<A NAME="164"></A>from any source, e.g. those who ply sordid trades, pimps and all such people, 
<A NAME="165"></A>and those who lend small sums and at high rates. For all of these take 
<A NAME="166"></A>more than they ought and from wrong sources. What is common to them is 
<A NAME="167"></A>evidently sordid love of gain; they all put up with a bad name for the 
<A NAME="168"></A>sake of gain, and little gain at that. For those who make great gains but 
<A NAME="169"></A>from wrong sources, and not the right gains, e.g. despots when they sack 
<A NAME="170"></A>cities and spoil temples, we do not call mean but rather wicked, impious, 
<A NAME="171"></A>and unjust. But the gamester and the footpad (and the highwayman) belong 
<A NAME="172"></A>to the class of the mean, since they have a sordid love of gain. For it 
<A NAME="173"></A>is for gain that both of them ply their craft and endure the disgrace of 
<A NAME="174"></A>it, and the one faces the greatest dangers for the sake of the booty, while 
<A NAME="175"></A>the other makes gain from his friends, to whom he ought to be giving. Both, 
<A NAME="176"></A>then, since they are willing to make gain from wrong sources, are sordid 
<A NAME="177"></A>lovers of gain; therefore all such forms of taking are 
<A NAME="178"></A>mean.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>And it is natural that meanness is described as the contrary of 
<A NAME="180"></A>liberality; for not only is it a greater evil than prodigality, but men 
<A NAME="181"></A>err more often in this direction than in the way of prodigality as we have 
<A NAME="182"></A>described it.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>So much, then, for liberality and the opposed 
<A NAME="184"></A>vices.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>2
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>It would seem proper to discuss magnificence next. For this also 
<A NAME="187"></A>seems to be a virtue concerned with wealth; but it does not like liberality 
<A NAME="188"></A>extend to all the actions that are concerned with wealth, but only to those 
<A NAME="189"></A>that involve expenditure; and in these it surpasses liberality in scale. 
<A NAME="190"></A>For, as the name itself suggests, it is a fitting expenditure involving 
<A NAME="191"></A>largeness of scale. But the scale is relative; for the expense of equipping 
<A NAME="192"></A>a trireme is not the same as that of heading a sacred embassy. It is what 
<A NAME="193"></A>is fitting, then, in relation to the agent, and to the circumstances and 
<A NAME="194"></A>the object. The man who in small or middling things spends according to 
<A NAME="195"></A>the merits of the case is not called magnificent (e.g. the man who can 
<A NAME="196"></A>say 'many a gift I gave the wanderer'), but only the man who does so in 
<A NAME="197"></A>great things. For the magnificent man is liberal, but the liberal man is 
<A NAME="198"></A>not necessarily magnificent. The deficiency of this state of character 
<A NAME="199"></A>is called niggardliness, the excess vulgarity, lack of taste, and the like, 
<A NAME="200"></A>which do not go to excess in the amount spent on right objects, but by 
<A NAME="201"></A>showy expenditure in the wrong circumstances and the wrong manner; we shall 
<A NAME="202"></A>speak of these vices later.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>The magnificent man is like an artist; for he can see what is fitting 
<A NAME="204"></A>and spend large sums tastefully. For, as we said at the begining, a state 
<A NAME="205"></A>of character is determined by its activities and by its objects. Now the 
<A NAME="206"></A>expenses of the magnificent man are large and fitting. Such, therefore, 
<A NAME="207"></A>are also his results; for thus there will be a great expenditure and one 
<A NAME="208"></A>that is fitting to its result. Therefore the result should be worthy of 
<A NAME="209"></A>the expense, and the expense should be worthy of the result, or should 
<A NAME="210"></A>even exceed it. And the magnificent man will spend such sums for honour's 
<A NAME="211"></A>sake; for this is common to the virtues. And further he will do so gladly 
<A NAME="212"></A>and lavishly; for nice calculation is a niggardly thing. And he will consider 
<A NAME="213"></A>how the result can be made most beautiful and most becoming rather than 
<A NAME="214"></A>for how much it can be produced and how it can be produced most cheaply. 
<A NAME="215"></A>It is necessary, then, that the magnificent man be also liberal. For the 
<A NAME="216"></A>liberal man also will spend what he ought and as he ought; and it is in 
<A NAME="217"></A>these matters that the greatness implied in the name of the magnificent 
<A NAME="218"></A>man-his bigness, as it were-is manifested, since liberality is concerned 
<A NAME="219"></A>with these matters; and at an equal expense he will produce a more magnificent 
<A NAME="220"></A>work of art. For a possession and a work of art have not the same excellence. 
<A NAME="221"></A>The most valuable possession is that which is worth most, e.g. gold, but 
<A NAME="222"></A>the most valuable work of art is that which is great and beautiful (for 
<A NAME="223"></A>the contemplation of such a work inspires admiration, and so does magnificence); 
<A NAME="224"></A>and a work has an excellence-viz. magnificence-which involves magnitude. 
<A NAME="225"></A>Magnificence is an attribute of expenditures of the kind which we call 
<A NAME="226"></A>honourable, e.g. those connected with the gods-votive offerings, buildings, 
<A NAME="227"></A>and sacrifices-and similarly with any form of religious worship, and all 
<A NAME="228"></A>those that are proper objects of public-spirited ambition, as when people 
<A NAME="229"></A>think they ought to equip a chorus or a trireme, or entertain the city, 
<A NAME="230"></A>in a brilliant way. But in all cases, as has been said, we have regard 
<A NAME="231"></A>to the agent as well and ask who he is and what means he has; for the expenditure 
<A NAME="232"></A>should be worthy of his means, and suit not only the result but also the 
<A NAME="233"></A>producer. Hence a poor man cannot be magnificent, since he has not the 
<A NAME="234"></A>means with which to spend large sums fittingly; and he who tries is a fool, 
<A NAME="235"></A>since he spends beyond what can be expected of him and what is proper, 
<A NAME="236"></A>but it is right expenditure that is virtuous. But great expenditure is 
<A NAME="237"></A>becoming to those who have suitable means to start with, acquired by their 
<A NAME="238"></A>own efforts or from ancestors or connexions, and to people of high birth 
<A NAME="239"></A>or reputation, and so on; for all these things bring with them greatness 
<A NAME="240"></A>and prestige. Primarily, then, the magnificent man is of this sort, and 
<A NAME="241"></A>magnificence is shown in expenditures of this sort, as has been said; for 
<A NAME="242"></A>these are the greatest and most honourable. Of private occasions of expenditure 
<A NAME="243"></A>the most suitable are those that take place once for all, e.g. a wedding 
<A NAME="244"></A>or anything of the kind, or anything that interests the whole city or the 
<A NAME="245"></A>people of position in it, and also the receiving of foreign guests and 
<A NAME="246"></A>the sending of them on their way, and gifts and counter-gifts; for the 
<A NAME="247"></A>magnificent man spends not on himself but on public objects, and gifts 
<A NAME="248"></A>bear some resemblance to votive offerings. A magnificent man will also 
<A NAME="249"></A>furnish his house suitably to his wealth (for even a house is a sort of 
<A NAME="250"></A>public ornament), and will spend by preference on those works that are 
<A NAME="251"></A>lasting (for these are the most beautiful), and on every class of things 
<A NAME="252"></A>he will spend what is becoming; for the same things are not suitable for 
<A NAME="253"></A>gods and for men, nor in a temple and in a tomb. And since each expenditure 
<A NAME="254"></A>may be great of its kind, and what is most magnificent absolutely is great 
<A NAME="255"></A>expenditure on a great object, but what is magnificent here is what is 
<A NAME="256"></A>great in these circumstances, and greatness in the work differs from greatness 
<A NAME="257"></A>in the expense (for the most beautiful ball or bottle is magnificent as 
<A NAME="258"></A>a gift to a child, but the price of it is small and mean),-therefore it 
<A NAME="259"></A>is characteristic of the magnificent man, whatever kind of result he is 
<A NAME="260"></A>producing, to produce it magnificently (for such a result is not easily 
<A NAME="261"></A>surpassed) and to make it worthy of the expenditure.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>Such, then, is the magnificent man; the man who goes to excess 
<A NAME="263"></A>and is vulgar exceeds, as has been said, by spending beyond what is right. 
<A NAME="264"></A>For on small objects of expenditure he spends much and displays a tasteless 
<A NAME="265"></A>showiness; e.g. he gives a club dinner on the scale of a wedding banquet, 
<A NAME="266"></A>and when he provides the chorus for a comedy he brings them on to the stage 
<A NAME="267"></A>in purple, as they do at Megara. And all such things he will do not for 
<A NAME="268"></A>honour's sake but to show off his wealth, and because he thinks he is admired 
<A NAME="269"></A>for these things, and where he ought to spend much he spends little and 
<A NAME="270"></A>where little, much. The niggardly man on the other hand will fall short 
<A NAME="271"></A>in everything, and after spending the greatest sums will spoil the beauty 
<A NAME="272"></A>of the result for a trifle, and whatever he is doing he will hesitate and 
<A NAME="273"></A>consider how he may spend least, and lament even that, and think he is 
<A NAME="274"></A>doing everything on a bigger scale than he ought.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>These states of character, then, are vices; yet they do not bring 
<A NAME="276"></A>disgrace because they are neither harmful to one's neighbour nor very 
<A NAME="277"></A>unseemly.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>3
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>Pride seems even from its name to be concerned with great things; 
<A NAME="280"></A>what sort of great things, is the first question we must try to answer. 
<A NAME="281"></A>It makes no difference whether we consider the state of character or the 
<A NAME="282"></A>man characterized by it. Now the man is thought to be proud who thinks 
<A NAME="283"></A>himself worthy of great things, being worthy of them; for he who does so 
<A NAME="284"></A>beyond his deserts is a fool, but no virtuous man is foolish or silly. 
<A NAME="285"></A>The proud man, then, is the man we have described. For he who is worthy 
<A NAME="286"></A>of little and thinks himself worthy of little is temperate, but not proud; 
<A NAME="287"></A>for pride implies greatness, as beauty implies a goodsized body, and little 
<A NAME="288"></A>people may be neat and well-proportioned but cannot be beautiful. On the 
<A NAME="289"></A>other hand, he who thinks himself worthy of great things, being unworthy 
<A NAME="290"></A>of them, is vain; though not every one who thinks himself worthy of more 
<A NAME="291"></A>than he really is worthy of in vain. The man who thinks himself worthy 
<A NAME="292"></A>of worthy of less than he is really worthy of is unduly humble, whether 
<A NAME="293"></A>his deserts be great or moderate, or his deserts be small but his claims 
<A NAME="294"></A>yet smaller. And the man whose deserts are great would seem most unduly 
<A NAME="295"></A>humble; for what would he have done if they had been less? The proud man, 
<A NAME="296"></A>then, is an extreme in respect of the greatness of his claims, but a mean 
<A NAME="297"></A>in respect of the rightness of them; for he claims what is accordance with 
<A NAME="298"></A>his merits, while the others go to excess or fall short.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>If, then, he deserves and claims great things, and above all the 
<A NAME="300"></A>great things, he will be concerned with one thing in particular. Desert 
<A NAME="301"></A>is relative to external goods; and the greatest of these, we should say, 
<A NAME="302"></A>is that which we render to the gods, and which people of position most 
<A NAME="303"></A>aim at, and which is the prize appointed for the noblest deeds; and this 
<A NAME="304"></A>is honour; that is surely the greatest of external goods. Honours and dishonours, 
<A NAME="305"></A>therefore, are the objects with respect to which the proud man is as he 
<A NAME="306"></A>should be. And even apart from argument it is with honour that proud men 
<A NAME="307"></A>appear to be concerned; for it is honour that they chiefly claim, but in 
<A NAME="308"></A>accordance with their deserts. The unduly humble man falls short both in 
<A NAME="309"></A>comparison with his own merits and in comparison with the proud man's claims. 
<A NAME="310"></A>The vain man goes to excess in comparison with his own merits, but does 
<A NAME="311"></A>not exceed the proud man's claims.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>Now the proud man, since he deserves most, must be good in the 
<A NAME="313"></A>highest degree; for the better man always deserves more, and the best man 
<A NAME="314"></A>most. Therefore the truly proud man must be good. And greatness in every 
<A NAME="315"></A>virtue would seem to be characteristic of a proud man. And it would be 
<A NAME="316"></A>most unbecoming for a proud man to fly from danger, swinging his arms by 
<A NAME="317"></A>his sides, or to wrong another; for to what end should he do disgraceful 
<A NAME="318"></A>acts, he to whom nothing is great? If we consider him point by point we 
<A NAME="319"></A>shall see the utter absurdity of a proud man who is not good. Nor, again, 
<A NAME="320"></A>would he be worthy of honour if he were bad; for honour is the prize of 
<A NAME="321"></A>virtue, and it is to the good that it is rendered. Pride, then, seems to 
<A NAME="322"></A>be a sort of crown of the virtues; for it makes them greater, and it is 
<A NAME="323"></A>not found without them. Therefore it is hard to be truly proud; for it 
<A NAME="324"></A>is impossible without nobility and goodness of character. It is chiefly 
<A NAME="325"></A>with honours and dishonours, then, that the proud man is concerned; and 
<A NAME="326"></A>at honours that are great and conferred by good men he will be moderately 
<A NAME="327"></A>Pleased, thinking that he is coming by his own or even less than his own; 
<A NAME="328"></A>for there can be no honour that is worthy of perfect virtue, yet he will 
<A NAME="329"></A>at any rate accept it since they have nothing greater to bestow on him; 
<A NAME="330"></A>but honour from casual people and on trifling grounds he will utterly despise, 
<A NAME="331"></A>since it is not this that he deserves, and dishonour too, since in his 
<A NAME="332"></A>case it cannot be just. In the first place, then, as has been said, the 
<A NAME="333"></A>proud man is concerned with honours; yet he will also bear himself with 
<A NAME="334"></A>moderation towards wealth and power and all good or evil fortune, whatever 
<A NAME="335"></A>may befall him, and will be neither over-joyed by good fortune nor over-pained 
<A NAME="336"></A>by evil. For not even towards honour does he bear himself as if it were 
<A NAME="337"></A>a very great thing. Power and wealth are desirable for the sake of honour 
<A NAME="338"></A>(at least those who have them wish to get honour by means of them); and 
<A NAME="339"></A>for him to whom even honour is a little thing the others must be so too. 
<A NAME="340"></A>Hence proud men are thought to be disdainful.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>The goods of fortune also are thought to contribute towards pride. 
<A NAME="342"></A>For men who are well-born are thought worthy of honour, and so are those 
<A NAME="343"></A>who enjoy power or wealth; for they are in a superior position, and everything 
<A NAME="344"></A>that has a superiority in something good is held in greater honour. Hence 
<A NAME="345"></A>even such things make men prouder; for they are honoured by some for having 
<A NAME="346"></A>them; but in truth the good man alone is to be honoured; he, however, who 
<A NAME="347"></A>has both advantages is thought the more worthy of honour. But those who 
<A NAME="348"></A>without virtue have such goods are neither justified in making great claims 
<A NAME="349"></A>nor entitled to the name of 'proud'; for these things imply perfect virtue. 
<A NAME="350"></A>Disdainful and insolent, however, even those who have such goods become. 
<A NAME="351"></A>For without virtue it is not easy to bear gracefully the goods of fortune; 
<A NAME="352"></A>and, being unable to bear them, and thinking themselves superior to others, 
<A NAME="353"></A>they despise others and themselves do what they please. They imitate the 
<A NAME="354"></A>proud man without being like him, and this they do where they can; so they 
<A NAME="355"></A>do not act virtuously, but they do despise others. For the proud man despises 
<A NAME="356"></A>justly (since he thinks truly), but the many do so at 
<A NAME="357"></A>random.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>He does not run into trifling dangers, nor is he fond of danger, 
<A NAME="359"></A>because he honours few things; but he will face great dangers, and when 
<A NAME="360"></A>he is in danger he is unsparing of his life, knowing that there are conditions 
<A NAME="361"></A>on which life is not worth having. And he is the sort of man to confer 
<A NAME="362"></A>benefits, but he is ashamed of receiving them; for the one is the mark 
<A NAME="363"></A>of a superior, the other of an inferior. And he is apt to confer greater 
<A NAME="364"></A>benefits in return; for thus the original benefactor besides being paid 
<A NAME="365"></A>will incur a debt to him, and will be the gainer by the transaction. They 
<A NAME="366"></A>seem also to remember any service they have done, but not those they have 
<A NAME="367"></A>received (for he who receives a service is inferior to him who has done 
<A NAME="368"></A>it, but the proud man wishes to be superior), and to hear of the former 
<A NAME="369"></A>with pleasure, of the latter with displeasure; this, it seems, is why Thetis 
<A NAME="370"></A>did not mention to Zeus the services she had done him, and why the Spartans 
<A NAME="371"></A>did not recount their services to the Athenians, but those they had received. 
<A NAME="372"></A>It is a mark of the proud man also to ask for nothing or scarcely anything, 
<A NAME="373"></A>but to give help readily, and to be dignified towards people who enjoy 
<A NAME="374"></A>high position and good fortune, but unassuming towards those of the middle 
<A NAME="375"></A>class; for it is a difficult and lofty thing to be superior to the former, 
<A NAME="376"></A>but easy to be so to the latter, and a lofty bearing over the former is 
<A NAME="377"></A>no mark of ill-breeding, but among humble people it is as vulgar as a display 
<A NAME="378"></A>of strength against the weak. Again, it is characteristic of the proud 
<A NAME="379"></A>man not to aim at the things commonly held in honour, or the things in 
<A NAME="380"></A>which others excel; to be sluggish and to hold back except where great 
<A NAME="381"></A>honour or a great work is at stake, and to be a man of few deeds, but of 
<A NAME="382"></A>great and notable ones. He must also be open in his hate and in his love 
<A NAME="383"></A>(for to conceal one's feelings, i.e. to care less for truth than for what 
<A NAME="384"></A>people will think, is a coward's part), and must speak and act openly; 
<A NAME="385"></A>for he is free of speech because he is contemptuous, and he is given to 
<A NAME="386"></A>telling the truth, except when he speaks in irony to the vulgar. He must 
<A NAME="387"></A>be unable to make his life revolve round another, unless it be a friend; 
<A NAME="388"></A>for this is slavish, and for this reason all flatterers are servile and 
<A NAME="389"></A>people lacking in self-respect are flatterers. Nor is he given to admiration; 
<A NAME="390"></A>for nothing to him is great. Nor is he mindful of wrongs; for it is not 
<A NAME="391"></A>the part of a proud man to have a long memory, especially for wrongs, but 
<A NAME="392"></A>rather to overlook them. Nor is he a gossip; for he will speak neither 
<A NAME="393"></A>about himself nor about another, since he cares not to be praised nor for 
<A NAME="394"></A>others to be blamed; nor again is he given to praise; and for the same 
<A NAME="395"></A>reason he is not an evil-speaker, even about his enemies, except from haughtiness. 
<A NAME="396"></A>With regard to necessary or small matters he is least of all me given to 
<A NAME="397"></A>lamentation or the asking of favours; for it is the part of one who takes 
<A NAME="398"></A>such matters seriously to behave so with respect to them. He is one who 
<A NAME="399"></A>will possess beautiful and profitless things rather than profitable and 
<A NAME="400"></A>useful ones; for this is more proper to a character that suffices to 
<A NAME="401"></A>itself.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>Further, a slow step is thought proper to the proud man, a deep 
<A NAME="403"></A>voice, and a level utterance; for the man who takes few things seriously 
<A NAME="404"></A>is not likely to be hurried, nor the man who thinks nothing great to be 
<A NAME="405"></A>excited, while a shrill voice and a rapid gait are the results of hurry 
<A NAME="406"></A>and excitement.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>Such, then, is the proud man; the man who falls short of him is 
<A NAME="408"></A>unduly humble, and the man who goes beyond him is vain. Now even these 
<A NAME="409"></A>are not thought to be bad (for they are not malicious), but only mistaken. 
<A NAME="410"></A>For the unduly humble man, being worthy of good things, robs himself of 
<A NAME="411"></A>what he deserves, and to have something bad about him from the fact that 
<A NAME="412"></A>he does not think himself worthy of good things, and seems also not to 
<A NAME="413"></A>know himself; else he would have desired the things he was worthy of, since 
<A NAME="414"></A>these were good. Yet such people are not thought to be fools, but rather 
<A NAME="415"></A>unduly retiring. Such a reputation, however, seems actually to make them 
<A NAME="416"></A>worse; for each class of people aims at what corresponds to its worth, 
<A NAME="417"></A>and these people stand back even from noble actions and undertakings, deeming 
<A NAME="418"></A>themselves unworthy, and from external goods no less. Vain people, on the 
<A NAME="419"></A>other hand, are fools and ignorant of themselves, and that manifestly; 
<A NAME="420"></A>for, not being worthy of them, they attempt honourable undertakings, and 
<A NAME="421"></A>then are found out; and tetadorn themselves with clothing and outward show 
<A NAME="422"></A>and such things, and wish their strokes of good fortune to be made public, 
<A NAME="423"></A>and speak about them as if they would be honoured for them. But undue humility 
<A NAME="424"></A>is more opposed to pride than vanity is; for it is both commoner and 
<A NAME="425"></A>worse.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>Pride, then, is concerned with honour on the grand scale, as has 
<A NAME="427"></A>been said.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>4
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>There seems to be in the sphere of honour also, as was said in 
<A NAME="430"></A>our first remarks on the subject, a virtue which would appear to be related 
<A NAME="431"></A>to pride as liberality is to magnificence. For neither of these has anything 
<A NAME="432"></A>to do with the grand scale, but both dispose us as is right with regard 
<A NAME="433"></A>to middling and unimportant objects; as in getting and giving of wealth 
<A NAME="434"></A>there is a mean and an excess and defect, so too honour may be desired 
<A NAME="435"></A>more than is right, or less, or from the right sources and in the right 
<A NAME="436"></A>way. We blame both the ambitious man as am at honour more than is right 
<A NAME="437"></A>and from wrong sources, and the unambitious man as not willing to be honoured 
<A NAME="438"></A>even for noble reasons. But sometimes we praise the ambitious man as being 
<A NAME="439"></A>manly and a lover of what is noble, and the unambitious man as being moderate 
<A NAME="440"></A>and self-controlled, as we said in our first treatment of the subject. 
<A NAME="441"></A>Evidently, since 'fond of such and such an object' has more than one meaning, 
<A NAME="442"></A>we do not assign the term 'ambition' or 'love of honour' always to the 
<A NAME="443"></A>same thing, but when we praise the quality we think of the man who loves 
<A NAME="444"></A>honour more than most people, and when we blame it we think of him who 
<A NAME="445"></A>loves it more than is right. The mean being without a name, the extremes 
<A NAME="446"></A>seem to dispute for its place as though that were vacant by default. But 
<A NAME="447"></A>where there is excess and defect, there is also an intermediate; now men 
<A NAME="448"></A>desire honour both more than they should and less; therefore it is possible 
<A NAME="449"></A>also to do so as one should; at all events this is the state of character 
<A NAME="450"></A>that is praised, being an unnamed mean in respect of honour. Relatively 
<A NAME="451"></A>to ambition it seems to be unambitiousness, and relatively to unambitiousness 
<A NAME="452"></A>it seems to be ambition, while relatively to both severally it seems in 
<A NAME="453"></A>a sense to be both together. This appears to be true of the other virtues 
<A NAME="454"></A>also. But in this case the extremes seem to be contradictories because 
<A NAME="455"></A>the mean has not received a name.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>5
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>Good temper is a mean with respect to anger; the middle state being 
<A NAME="458"></A>unnamed, and the extremes almost without a name as well, we place good 
<A NAME="459"></A>temper in the middle position, though it inclines towards the deficiency, 
<A NAME="460"></A>which is without a name. The excess might called a sort of 'irascibility'. 
<A NAME="461"></A>For the passion is anger, while its causes are many and 
<A NAME="462"></A>diverse.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>The man who is angry at the right things and with the right people, 
<A NAME="464"></A>and, further, as he ought, when he ought, and as long as he ought, is praised. 
<A NAME="465"></A>This will be the good-tempered man, then, since good temper is praised. 
<A NAME="466"></A>For the good-tempered man tends to be unperturbed and not to be led by 
<A NAME="467"></A>passion, but to be angry in the manner, at the things, and for the length 
<A NAME="468"></A>of time, that the rule dictates; but he is thought to err rather in the 
<A NAME="469"></A>direction of deficiency; for the good-tempered man is not revengeful, but 
<A NAME="470"></A>rather tends to make allowances.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>The deficiency, whether it is a sort of 'inirascibility' or whatever 
<A NAME="472"></A>it is, is blamed. For those who are not angry at the things they should 
<A NAME="473"></A>be angry at are thought to be fools, and so are those who are not angry 
<A NAME="474"></A>in the right way, at the right time, or with the right persons; for such 
<A NAME="475"></A>a man is thought not to feel things nor to be pained by them, and, since 
<A NAME="476"></A>he does not get angry, he is thought unlikely to defend himself; and to 
<A NAME="477"></A>endure being insulted and put up with insult to one's friends is 
<A NAME="478"></A>slavish.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>The excess can be manifested in all the points that have been named 
<A NAME="480"></A>(for one can be angry with the wrong persons, at the wrong things, more 
<A NAME="481"></A>than is right, too quickly, or too long); yet all are not found in the 
<A NAME="482"></A>same person. Indeed they could not; for evil destroys even itself, and 
<A NAME="483"></A>if it is complete becomes unbearable. Now hot-tempered people get angry 
<A NAME="484"></A>quickly and with the wrong persons and at the wrong things and more than 
<A NAME="485"></A>is right, but their anger ceases quickly-which is the best point about 
<A NAME="486"></A>them. This happens to them because they do not restrain their anger but 
<A NAME="487"></A>retaliate openly owing to their quickness of temper, and then their anger 
<A NAME="488"></A>ceases. By reason of excess choleric people are quick-tempered and ready 
<A NAME="489"></A>to be angry with everything and on every occasion; whence their name. Sulky 
<A NAME="490"></A>people are hard to appease, and retain their anger long; for they repress 
<A NAME="491"></A>their passion. But it ceases when they retaliate; for revenge relieves 
<A NAME="492"></A>them of their anger, producing in them pleasure instead of pain. If this 
<A NAME="493"></A>does not happen they retain their burden; for owing to its not being obvious 
<A NAME="494"></A>no one even reasons with them, and to digest one's anger in oneself takes 
<A NAME="495"></A>time. Such people are most troublesome to themselves and to their dearest 
<A NAME="496"></A>friends. We call had-tempered those who are angry at the wrong things, 
<A NAME="497"></A>more than is right, and longer, and cannot be appeased until they inflict 
<A NAME="498"></A>vengeance or punishment.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR>To good temper we oppose the excess rather than the defect; for 
<A NAME="500"></A>not only is it commoner since revenge is the more human), but bad-tempered 
<A NAME="501"></A>people are worse to live with.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>What we have said in our earlier treatment of the subject is plain 
<A NAME="503"></A>also from what we are now saying; viz. that it is not easy to define how, 
<A NAME="504"></A>with whom, at what, and how long one should be angry, and at what point 
<A NAME="505"></A>right action ceases and wrong begins. For the man who strays a little from 
<A NAME="506"></A>the path, either towards the more or towards the less, is not blamed; since 
<A NAME="507"></A>sometimes we praise those who exhibit the deficiency, and call them good-tempered, 
<A NAME="508"></A>and sometimes we call angry people manly, as being capable of ruling. How 
<A NAME="509"></A>far, therefore, and how a man must stray before he becomes blameworthy, 
<A NAME="510"></A>it is not easy to state in words; for the decision depends on the particular 
<A NAME="511"></A>facts and on perception. But so much at least is plain, that the middle 
<A NAME="512"></A>state is praiseworthy- that in virtue of which we are angry with the right 
<A NAME="513"></A>people, at the right things, in the right way, and so on, while the excesses 
<A NAME="514"></A>and defects are blameworthy- slightly so if they are present in a low degree, 
<A NAME="515"></A>more if in a higher degree, and very much if in a high degree. Evidently, 
<A NAME="516"></A>then, we must cling to the middle state.- Enough of the states relative 
<A NAME="517"></A>to anger.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>6
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>In gatherings of men, in social life and the interchange of words 
<A NAME="520"></A>and deeds, some men are thought to be obsequious, viz. those who to give 
<A NAME="521"></A>pleasure praise everything and never oppose, but think it their duty 'to 
<A NAME="522"></A>give no pain to the people they meet'; while those who, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="523"></A>oppose everything and care not a whit about giving pain are called churlish 
<A NAME="524"></A>and contentious. That the states we have named are culpable is plain enough, 
<A NAME="525"></A>and that the middle state is laudable- that in virtue of which a man will 
<A NAME="526"></A>put up with, and will resent, the right things and in the right way; but 
<A NAME="527"></A>no name has been assigned to it, though it most resembles friendship. For 
<A NAME="528"></A>the man who corresponds to this middle state is very much what, with affection 
<A NAME="529"></A>added, we call a good friend. But the state in question differs from friendship 
<A NAME="530"></A>in that it implies no passion or affection for one's associates; since 
<A NAME="531"></A>it is not by reason of loving or hating that such a man takes everything 
<A NAME="532"></A>in the right way, but by being a man of a certain kind. For he will behave 
<A NAME="533"></A>so alike towards those he knows and those he does not know, towards intimates 
<A NAME="534"></A>and those who are not so, except that in each of these cases he will behave 
<A NAME="535"></A>as is befitting; for it is not proper to have the same care for intimates 
<A NAME="536"></A>and for strangers, nor again is it the same conditions that make it right 
<A NAME="537"></A>to give pain to them. Now we have said generally that he will associate 
<A NAME="538"></A>with people in the right way; but it is by reference to what is honourable 
<A NAME="539"></A>and expedient that he will aim at not giving pain or at contributing pleasure. 
<A NAME="540"></A>For he seems to be concerned with the pleasures and pains of social life; 
<A NAME="541"></A>and wherever it is not honourable, or is harmful, for him to contribute 
<A NAME="542"></A>pleasure, he will refuse, and will choose rather to give pain; also if 
<A NAME="543"></A>his acquiescence in another's action would bring disgrace, and that in 
<A NAME="544"></A>a high degree, or injury, on that other, while his opposition brings a 
<A NAME="545"></A>little pain, he will not acquiesce but will decline. He will associate 
<A NAME="546"></A>differently with people in high station and with ordinary people, with 
<A NAME="547"></A>closer and more distant acquaintances, and so too with regard to all other 
<A NAME="548"></A>differences, rendering to each class what is befitting, and while for its 
<A NAME="549"></A>own sake he chooses to contribute pleasure, and avoids the giving of pain, 
<A NAME="550"></A>he will be guided by the consequences, if these are greater, i.e. honour 
<A NAME="551"></A>and expediency. For the sake of a great future pleasure, too, he will inflict 
<A NAME="552"></A>small pains.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>The man who attains the mean, then, is such as we have described, 
<A NAME="554"></A>but has not received a name; of those who contribute pleasure, the man 
<A NAME="555"></A>who aims at being pleasant with no ulterior object is obsequious, but the 
<A NAME="556"></A>man who does so in order that he may get some advantage in the direction 
<A NAME="557"></A>of money or the things that money buys is a flatterer; while the man who 
<A NAME="558"></A>quarrels with everything is, as has been said, churlish and contentious. 
<A NAME="559"></A>And the extremes seem to be contradictory to each other because the mean 
<A NAME="560"></A>is without a name.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR>7
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><BR>The mean opposed to boastfulness is found in almost the same sphere; 
<A NAME="563"></A>and this also is without a name. It will be no bad plan to describe these 
<A NAME="564"></A>states as well; for we shall both know the facts about character better 
<A NAME="565"></A>if we go through them in detail, and we shall be convinced that the virtues 
<A NAME="566"></A>are means if we see this to be so in all cases. In the field of social 
<A NAME="567"></A>life those who make the giving of pleasure or pain their object in associating 
<A NAME="568"></A>with others have been described; let us now describe those who pursue truth 
<A NAME="569"></A>or falsehood alike in words and deeds and in the claims they put forward. 
<A NAME="570"></A>The boastful man, then, is thought to be apt to claim the things that bring 
<A NAME="571"></A>glory, when he has not got them, or to claim more of them than he has, 
<A NAME="572"></A>and the mock-modest man on the other hand to disclaim what he has or belittle 
<A NAME="573"></A>it, while the man who observes the mean is one who calls a thing by its 
<A NAME="574"></A>own name, being truthful both in life and in word, owning to what he has, 
<A NAME="575"></A>and neither more nor less. Now each of these courses may be adopted either 
<A NAME="576"></A>with or without an object. But each man speaks and acts and lives in accordance 
<A NAME="577"></A>with his character, if he is not acting for some ulterior object. And falsehood 
<A NAME="578"></A>is in itself mean and culpable, and truth noble and worthy of praise. Thus 
<A NAME="579"></A>the truthful man is another case of a man who, being in the mean, is worthy 
<A NAME="580"></A>of praise, and both forms of untruthful man are culpable, and particularly 
<A NAME="581"></A>the boastful man.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>Let us discuss them both, but first of all the truthful man. We 
<A NAME="583"></A>are not speaking of the man who keeps faith in his agreements, i.e. in 
<A NAME="584"></A>the things that pertain to justice or injustice (for this would belong 
<A NAME="585"></A>to another virtue), but the man who in the matters in which nothing of 
<A NAME="586"></A>this sort is at stake is true both in word and in life because his character 
<A NAME="587"></A>is such. But such a man would seem to be as a matter of fact equitable. 
<A NAME="588"></A>For the man who loves truth, and is truthful where nothing is at stake, 
<A NAME="589"></A>will still more be truthful where something is at stake; he will avoid 
<A NAME="590"></A>falsehood as something base, seeing that he avoided it even for its own 
<A NAME="591"></A>sake; and such a man is worthy of praise. He inclines rather to understate 
<A NAME="592"></A>the truth; for this seems in better taste because exaggerations are 
<A NAME="593"></A>wearisome.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR>He who claims more than he has with no ulterior object is a contemptible 
<A NAME="595"></A>sort of fellow (otherwise he would not have delighted in falsehood), but 
<A NAME="596"></A>seems futile rather than bad; but if he does it for an object, he who does 
<A NAME="597"></A>it for the sake of reputation or honour is (for a boaster) not very much 
<A NAME="598"></A>to be blamed, but he who does it for money, or the things that lead to 
<A NAME="599"></A>money, is an uglier character (it is not the capacity that makes the boaster, 
<A NAME="600"></A>but the purpose; for it is in virtue of his state of character and by being 
<A NAME="601"></A>a man of a certain kind that he is boaster); as one man is a liar because 
<A NAME="602"></A>he enjoys the lie itself, and another because he desires reputation or 
<A NAME="603"></A>gain. Now those who boast for the sake of reputation claim such qualities 
<A NAME="604"></A>as will praise or congratulation, but those whose object is gain claim 
<A NAME="605"></A>qualities which are of value to one's neighbours and one's lack of which 
<A NAME="606"></A>is not easily detected, e.g. the powers of a seer, a sage, or a physician. 
<A NAME="607"></A>For this reason it is such things as these that most people claim and boast 
<A NAME="608"></A>about; for in them the above-mentioned qualities are 
<A NAME="609"></A>found.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>Mock-modest people, who understate things, seem more attractive 
<A NAME="611"></A>in character; for they are thought to speak not for gain but to avoid parade; 
<A NAME="612"></A>and here too it is qualities which bring reputation that they disclaim, 
<A NAME="613"></A>as Socrates used to do. Those who disclaim trifling and obvious qualities 
<A NAME="614"></A>are called humbugs and are more contemptible; and sometimes this seems 
<A NAME="615"></A>to be boastfulness, like the Spartan dress; for both excess and great deficiency 
<A NAME="616"></A>are boastful. But those who use understatement with moderation and understate 
<A NAME="617"></A>about matters that do not very much force themselves on our notice seem 
<A NAME="618"></A>attractive. And it is the boaster that seems to be opposed to the truthful 
<A NAME="619"></A>man; for he is the worse character.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>8
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR>Since life includes rest as well as activity, and in this is included 
<A NAME="622"></A>leisure and amusement, there seems here also to be a kind of intercourse 
<A NAME="623"></A>which is tasteful; there is such a thing as saying- and again listening 
<A NAME="624"></A>to- what one should and as one should. The kind of people one is speaking 
<A NAME="625"></A>or listening to will also make a difference. Evidently here also there 
<A NAME="626"></A>is both an excess and a deficiency as compared with the mean. Those who 
<A NAME="627"></A>carry humour to excess are thought to be vulgar buffoons, striving after 
<A NAME="628"></A>humour at all costs, and aiming rather at raising a laugh than at saying 
<A NAME="629"></A>what is becoming and at avoiding pain to the object of their fun; while 
<A NAME="630"></A>those who can neither make a joke themselves nor put up with those who 
<A NAME="631"></A>do are thought to be boorish and unpolished. But those who joke in a tasteful 
<A NAME="632"></A>way are called ready-witted, which implies a sort of readiness to turn 
<A NAME="633"></A>this way and that; for such sallies are thought to be movements of the 
<A NAME="634"></A>character, and as bodies are discriminated by their movements, so too are 
<A NAME="635"></A>characters. The ridiculous side of things is not far to seek, however, 
<A NAME="636"></A>and most people delight more than they should in amusement and in jestinly. 
<A NAME="637"></A>and so even buffoons are called ready-witted because they are found attractive; 
<A NAME="638"></A>but that they differ from the ready-witted man, and to no small extent, 
<A NAME="639"></A>is clear from what has been said.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>To the middle state belongs also tact; it is the mark of a tactful 
<A NAME="641"></A>man to say and listen to such things as befit a good and well-bred man; 
<A NAME="642"></A>for there are some things that it befits such a man to say and to hear 
<A NAME="643"></A>by way of jest, and the well-bred man's jesting differs from that of a 
<A NAME="644"></A>vulgar man, and the joking of an educated man from that of an uneducated. 
<A NAME="645"></A>One may see this even from the old and the new comedies; to the authors 
<A NAME="646"></A>of the former indecency of language was amusing, to those of the latter 
<A NAME="647"></A>innuendo is more so; and these differ in no small degree in respect of 
<A NAME="648"></A>propriety. Now should we define the man who jokes well by his saying what 
<A NAME="649"></A>is not unbecoming to a well-bred man, or by his not giving pain, or even 
<A NAME="650"></A>giving delight, to the hearer? Or is the latter definition, at any rate, 
<A NAME="651"></A>itself indefinite, since different things are hateful or pleasant to different 
<A NAME="652"></A>people? The kind of jokes he will listen to will be the same; for the kind 
<A NAME="653"></A>he can put up with are also the kind he seems to make. There are, then, 
<A NAME="654"></A>jokes he will not make; for the jest is a sort of abuse, and there are 
<A NAME="655"></A>things that lawgivers forbid us to abuse; and they should, perhaps, have 
<A NAME="656"></A>forbidden us even to make a jest of such. The refined and well-bred man, 
<A NAME="657"></A>therefore, will be as we have described, being as it were a law to 
<A NAME="658"></A>himself.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR>Such, then, is the man who observes the mean, whether he be called 
<A NAME="660"></A>tactful or ready-witted. The buffoon, on the other hand, is the slave of 
<A NAME="661"></A>his sense of humour, and spares neither himself nor others if he can raise 
<A NAME="662"></A>a laugh, and says things none of which a man of refinement would say, and 
<A NAME="663"></A>to some of which he would not even listen. The boor, again, is useless 
<A NAME="664"></A>for such social intercourse; for he contributes nothing and finds fault 
<A NAME="665"></A>with everything. But relaxation and amusement are thought to be a necessary 
<A NAME="666"></A>element in life.
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>The means in life that have been described, then, are three in 
<A NAME="668"></A>number, and are all concerned with an interchange of words and deeds of 
<A NAME="669"></A>some kind. They differ, however, in that one is concerned with truth; and 
<A NAME="670"></A>the other two with pleasantness. Of those concerned with pleasure, one 
<A NAME="671"></A>is displayed in jests, the other in the general social intercourse of 
<A NAME="672"></A>life.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR>9
<A NAME="674"></A><BR><BR>Shame should not be described as a virtue; for it is more like 
<A NAME="675"></A>a feeling than a state of character. It is defined, at any rate, as a kind 
<A NAME="676"></A>of fear of dishonour, and produces an effect similar to that produced by 
<A NAME="677"></A>fear of danger; for people who feel disgraced blush, and those who fear 
<A NAME="678"></A>death turn pale. Both, therefore, seem to be in a sense bodily conditions, 
<A NAME="679"></A>which is thought to be characteristic of feeling rather than of a state 
<A NAME="680"></A>of character.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>The feeling is not becoming to every age, but only to youth. For 
<A NAME="682"></A>we think young people should be prone to the feeling of shame because they 
<A NAME="683"></A>live by feeling and therefore commit many errors, but are restrained by 
<A NAME="684"></A>shame; and we praise young people who are prone to this feeling, but an 
<A NAME="685"></A>older person no one would praise for being prone to the sense of disgrace, 
<A NAME="686"></A>since we think he should not do anything that need cause this sense. For 
<A NAME="687"></A>the sense of disgrace is not even characteristic of a good man, since it 
<A NAME="688"></A>is consequent on bad actions (for such actions should not be done; and 
<A NAME="689"></A>if some actions are disgraceful in very truth and others only according 
<A NAME="690"></A>to common opinion, this makes no difference; for neither class of actions 
<A NAME="691"></A>should be done, so that no disgrace should be felt); and it is a mark of 
<A NAME="692"></A>a bad man even to be such as to do any disgraceful action. To be so constituted 
<A NAME="693"></A>as to feel disgraced if one does such an action, and for this reason to 
<A NAME="694"></A>think oneself good, is absurd; for it is for voluntary actions that shame 
<A NAME="695"></A>is felt, and the good man will never voluntarily do bad actions. But shame 
<A NAME="696"></A>may be said to be conditionally a good thing; if a good man does such actions, 
<A NAME="697"></A>he will feel disgraced; but the virtues are not subject to such a qualification. 
<A NAME="698"></A>And if shamelessness-not to be ashamed of doing base actions-is bad, that 
<A NAME="699"></A>does not make it good to be ashamed of doing such actions. Continence too 
<A NAME="700"></A>is not virtue, but a mixed sort of state; this will be shown later. Now, 
<A NAME="701"></A>however, let us discuss justice.
