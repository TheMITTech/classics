<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>The discussion of Definitions falls into five parts. For you have to show 
<A NAME="12"></A>either (1) that it is not true at all to apply the expression as well to 
<A NAME="13"></A>that to which the term is applied (for the definition of Man ought to be 
<A NAME="14"></A>true of every man); or (2) that though the object has a genus, he has failed 
<A NAME="15"></A>to put the object defined into the genus, or to put it into the appropriate 
<A NAME="16"></A>genus (for the framer of a definition should first place the object in 
<A NAME="17"></A>its genus, and then append its differences: for of all the elements of 
<A NAME="18"></A>the definition the genus is usually supposed to be the principal mark of 
<A NAME="19"></A>the essence of what is defined): or (3) that the expression is not peculiar 
<A NAME="20"></A>to the object (for, as we said above as well, a definition ought to be 
<A NAME="21"></A>peculiar): or else (4) see if, though he has observed all the aforesaid 
<A NAME="22"></A>cautions, he has yet failed to define the object, that is, to express its 
<A NAME="23"></A>essence. (5) It remains, apart from the foregoing, to see if he has defined 
<A NAME="24"></A>it, but defined it incorrectly.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>Whether, then, the expression be not also true of that of which 
<A NAME="26"></A>the term is true you should proceed to examine according to the commonplace 
<A NAME="27"></A>rules that relate to Accident. For there too the question is always 'Is 
<A NAME="28"></A>so and so true or untrue?': for whenever we argue that an accident belongs, 
<A NAME="29"></A>we declare it to be true, while whenever we argue that it does not belong, 
<A NAME="30"></A>we declare it to be untrue. If, again, he has failed to place the object 
<A NAME="31"></A>in the appropriate genus, or if the expression be not peculiar to the object, 
<A NAME="32"></A>we must go on to examine the case according to the commonplace rules that 
<A NAME="33"></A>relate to genus and property.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>It remains, then, to prescribe how to investigate whether the object 
<A NAME="35"></A>has been either not defined at all, or else defined incorrectly. First, 
<A NAME="36"></A>then, we must proceed to examine if it has been defined incorrectly: for 
<A NAME="37"></A>with anything it is easier to do it than to do it correctly. Clearly, then, 
<A NAME="38"></A>more mistakes are made in the latter task on account of its greater difficulty. 
<A NAME="39"></A>Accordingly the attack becomes easier in the latter case than in the 
<A NAME="40"></A>former.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>Incorrectness falls into two branches: (1) first, the use of obscure 
<A NAME="42"></A>language (for the language of a definition ought to be the very clearest 
<A NAME="43"></A>possible, seeing that the whole purpose of rendering it is to make something 
<A NAME="44"></A>known); (secondly, if the expression used be longer than is necessary: 
<A NAME="45"></A>for all additional matter in a definition is superfluous. Again, each of 
<A NAME="46"></A>the aforesaid branches is divided into a number of others.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="47"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>One commonplace rule, then, in regard to obscurity is, See if the 
<A NAME="49"></A>meaning intended by the definition involves an ambiguity with any other, 
<A NAME="50"></A>e.g. 'Becoming is a passage into being', or 'Health is the balance of hot 
<A NAME="51"></A>and cold elements'. Here 'passage' and 'balance' are ambiguous terms: it 
<A NAME="52"></A>is accordingly not clear which of the several possible senses of the term 
<A NAME="53"></A>he intends to convey. Likewise also, if the term defined be used in different 
<A NAME="54"></A>senses and he has spoken without distinguishing between them: for then 
<A NAME="55"></A>it is not clear to which of them the definition rendered applies, and one 
<A NAME="56"></A>can then bring a captious objection on the ground that the definition does 
<A NAME="57"></A>not apply to all the things whose definition he has rendered: and this 
<A NAME="58"></A>kind of thing is particularly easy in the case where the definer does not 
<A NAME="59"></A>see the ambiguity of his terms. Or, again, the questioner may himself distinguish 
<A NAME="60"></A>the various senses of the term rendered in the definition, and then institute 
<A NAME="61"></A>his argument against each: for if the expression used be not adequate to 
<A NAME="62"></A>the subject in any of its senses, it is clear that he cannot have defined 
<A NAME="63"></A>it in any sense aright.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>Another rule is, See if he has used a metaphorical expression, 
<A NAME="65"></A>as, for instance, if he has defined knowledge as 'unsupplantable', or the 
<A NAME="66"></A>earth as a 'nurse', or temperance as a 'harmony'. For a metaphorical expression 
<A NAME="67"></A>is always obscure. It is possible, also, to argue sophistically against 
<A NAME="68"></A>the user of a metaphorical expression as though he had used it in its literal 
<A NAME="69"></A>sense: for the definition stated will not apply to the term defined, e.g. 
<A NAME="70"></A>in the case of temperance: for harmony is always found between notes. Moreover, 
<A NAME="71"></A>if harmony be the genus of temperance, then the same object will occur 
<A NAME="72"></A>in two genera of which neither contains the other: for harmony does not 
<A NAME="73"></A>contain virtue, nor virtue harmony. Again, see if he uses terms that are 
<A NAME="74"></A>unfamiliar, as when Plato describes the eye as 'brow-shaded', or a certain 
<A NAME="75"></A>spider as poison-fanged', or the marrow as 'boneformed'. For an unusual 
<A NAME="76"></A>phrase is always obscure.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>Sometimes a phrase is used neither ambiguously, nor yet metaphorically, 
<A NAME="78"></A>nor yet literally, as when the law is said to be the 'measure' or 'image' 
<A NAME="79"></A>of the things that are by nature just. Such phrases are worse than metaphor; 
<A NAME="80"></A>for the latter does make its meaning to some extent clear because of the 
<A NAME="81"></A>likeness involved; for those who use metaphors do so always in view of 
<A NAME="82"></A>some likeness: whereas this kind of phrase makes nothing clear; for there 
<A NAME="83"></A>is no likeness to justify the description 'measure' or 'image', as applied 
<A NAME="84"></A>to the law, nor is the law ordinarily so called in a literal sense. So 
<A NAME="85"></A>then, if a man says that the law is literally a 'measure' or an 'image', 
<A NAME="86"></A>he speaks falsely: for an image is something produced by imitation, and 
<A NAME="87"></A>this is not found in the case of the law. If, on the other hand, he does 
<A NAME="88"></A>not mean the term literally, it is clear that he has used an unclear expression, 
<A NAME="89"></A>and one that is worse than any sort of metaphorical 
<A NAME="90"></A>expression.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see if from the expression used the definition of the 
<A NAME="92"></A>contrary be not clear; for definitions that have been correctly rendered 
<A NAME="93"></A>also indicate their contraries as well. Or, again, see if, when it is merely 
<A NAME="94"></A>stated by itself, it is not evident what it defines: just as in the works 
<A NAME="95"></A>of the old painters, unless there were an inscription, the figures used 
<A NAME="96"></A>to be unrecognizable.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="97"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="98"></A><BR>If, then, the definition be not clear, you should proceed to examine 
<A NAME="99"></A>on lines such as these. If, on the other hand, he has phrased the definition 
<A NAME="100"></A>redundantly, first of all look and see whether he has used any attribute 
<A NAME="101"></A>that belongs universally, either to real objects in general, or to all 
<A NAME="102"></A>that fall under the same genus as the object defined: for the mention of 
<A NAME="103"></A>this is sure to be redundant. For the genus ought to divide the object 
<A NAME="104"></A>from things in general, and the differentia from any of the things contained 
<A NAME="105"></A>in the same genus. Now any term that belongs to everything separates off 
<A NAME="106"></A>the given object from absolutely nothing, while any that belongs to all 
<A NAME="107"></A>the things that fall under the same genus does not separate it off from 
<A NAME="108"></A>the things contained in the same genus. Any addition, then, of that kind 
<A NAME="109"></A>will be pointless.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>Or see if, though the additional matter may be peculiar to the 
<A NAME="111"></A>given term, yet even when it is struck out the rest of the expression too 
<A NAME="112"></A>is peculiar and makes clear the essence of the term. Thus, in the definition 
<A NAME="113"></A>of man, the addition 'capable of receiving knowledge' is superfluous; for 
<A NAME="114"></A>strike it out, and still the expression is peculiar and makes clear his 
<A NAME="115"></A>essence. Speaking generally, everything is superfluous upon whose removal 
<A NAME="116"></A>the remainder still makes the term that is being defined clear. Such, for 
<A NAME="117"></A>instance, would also be the definition of the soul, assuming it to be stated 
<A NAME="118"></A>as a 'self-moving number'; for the soul is just 'the self-moving', as Plato 
<A NAME="119"></A>defined it. Or perhaps the expression used, though appropriate, yet does 
<A NAME="120"></A>not declare the essence, if the word 'number' be eliminated. Which of the 
<A NAME="121"></A>two is the real state of the case it is difficult to determine clearly: 
<A NAME="122"></A>the right way to treat the matter in all cases is to be guided by convenience. 
<A NAME="123"></A>Thus (e.g.) it is said that the definition of phlegm is the 'undigested 
<A NAME="124"></A>moisture that comes first off food'. Here the addition of the word 'undigested' 
<A NAME="125"></A>is superfluous, seeing that 'the first' is one and not many, so that even 
<A NAME="126"></A>when undigested' is left out the definition will still be peculiar to the 
<A NAME="127"></A>subject: for it is impossible that both phlegm and also something else 
<A NAME="128"></A>should both be the first to arise from the food. Or perhaps the phlegm 
<A NAME="129"></A>is not absolutely the first thing to come off the food, but only the first 
<A NAME="130"></A>of the undigested matters, so that the addition 'undigested' is required; 
<A NAME="131"></A>for stated the other way the definition would not be true unless the phlegm 
<A NAME="132"></A>comes first of all.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see if anything contained in the definition fails to 
<A NAME="134"></A>apply to everything that falls under the same species: for this sort of 
<A NAME="135"></A>definition is worse than those which include an attribute belonging to 
<A NAME="136"></A>all things universally. For in that case, if the remainder of the expression 
<A NAME="137"></A>be peculiar, the whole too will be peculiar: for absolutely always, if 
<A NAME="138"></A>to something peculiar anything whatever that is true be added, the whole 
<A NAME="139"></A>too becomes peculiar. Whereas if any part of the expression do not apply 
<A NAME="140"></A>to everything that falls under the same species, it is impossible that 
<A NAME="141"></A>the expression as a whole should be peculiar: for it will not be predicated 
<A NAME="142"></A>convertibly with the object; e.g. 'a walking biped animal six feet high': 
<A NAME="143"></A>for an expression of that kind is not predicated convertibly with the term, 
<A NAME="144"></A>because the attribute 'six feet high' does not belong to everything that 
<A NAME="145"></A>falls under the same species.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>Again, see if he has said the same thing more than once, saying 
<A NAME="147"></A>(e.g.) 'desire' is a 'conation for the pleasant'. For 'desire' is always 
<A NAME="148"></A>'for the pleasant', so that what is the same as desire will also be 'for 
<A NAME="149"></A>the pleasant'. Accordingly our definition of desire becomes 'conation-for-the-pleasant': 
<A NAME="150"></A>for the word 'desire' is the exact equivalent of the words 'conation for-the-pleasant', 
<A NAME="151"></A>so that both alike will be 'for the pleasant'. Or perhaps there is no absurdity 
<A NAME="152"></A>in this; for consider this instance:-Man is a biped': therefore, what is 
<A NAME="153"></A>the same as man is a biped: but 'a walking biped animal' is the same as 
<A NAME="154"></A>man, and therefore walking biped animal is a biped'. But this involves 
<A NAME="155"></A>no real absurdity. For 'biped' is not a predicate of 'walking animal': 
<A NAME="156"></A>if it were, then we should certainly have 'biped' predicated twice of the 
<A NAME="157"></A>same thing; but as a matter of fact the subject said to be a biped is'a 
<A NAME="158"></A>walking biped animal', so that the word 'biped' is only used as a predicate 
<A NAME="159"></A>once. Likewise also in the case of 'desire' as well: for it is not 'conation' 
<A NAME="160"></A>that is said to be 'for the pleasant', but rather the whole idea, so that 
<A NAME="161"></A>there too the predication is only made once. Absurdity results, not when 
<A NAME="162"></A>the same word is uttered twice, but when the same thing is more than once 
<A NAME="163"></A>predicated of a subject; e.g. if he says, like Xenocrates, that wisdom 
<A NAME="164"></A>defines and contemplates reality:' for definition is a certain type of 
<A NAME="165"></A>contemplation, so that by adding the words 'and contemplates' over again 
<A NAME="166"></A>he says the same thing twice over. Likewise, too, those fail who say that 
<A NAME="167"></A>'cooling' is 'the privation of natural heat'. For all privation is a privation 
<A NAME="168"></A>of some natural attribute, so that the addition of the word 'natural' is 
<A NAME="169"></A>superfluous: it would have been enough to say 'privation of heat', for 
<A NAME="170"></A>the word 'privation' shows of itself that the heat meant is natural 
<A NAME="171"></A>heat.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Again, see if a universal have been mentioned and then a particular 
<A NAME="173"></A>case of it be added as well, e.g. 'Equity is a remission of what is expedient 
<A NAME="174"></A>and just'; for what is just is a branch of what is expedient and is therefore 
<A NAME="175"></A>included in the latter term: its mention is therefore redundant, an addition 
<A NAME="176"></A>of the particular after the universal has been already stated. So also, 
<A NAME="177"></A>if he defines 'medicine' as 'knowledge of what makes for health in animals 
<A NAME="178"></A>and men', or 'the law' as 'the image of what is by nature noble and just'; 
<A NAME="179"></A>for what is just is a branch of what is noble, so that he says the same 
<A NAME="180"></A>thing more than once.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="181"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>Whether, then, a man defines a thing correctly or incorrectly you 
<A NAME="183"></A>should proceed to examine on these and similar lines. But whether he has 
<A NAME="184"></A>mentioned and defined its essence or no, should be examined as follows: 
<A NAME="185"></A>First of all, see if he has failed to make the definition through terms 
<A NAME="186"></A>that are prior and more intelligible. For the reason why the definition 
<A NAME="187"></A>is rendered is to make known the term stated, and we make things known 
<A NAME="188"></A>by taking not any random terms, but such as are prior and more intelligible, 
<A NAME="189"></A>as is done in demonstrations (for so it is with all teaching and learning); 
<A NAME="190"></A>accordingly, it is clear that a man who does not define through terms of 
<A NAME="191"></A>this kind has not defined at all. Otherwise, there will be more than one 
<A NAME="192"></A>definition of the same thing: for clearly he who defines through terms 
<A NAME="193"></A>that are prior and more intelligible has also framed a definition, and 
<A NAME="194"></A>a better one, so that both would then be definitions of the same object. 
<A NAME="195"></A>This sort of view, however, does not generally find acceptance: for of 
<A NAME="196"></A>each real object the essence is single: if, then, there are to be a number 
<A NAME="197"></A>of definitions of the same thing, the essence of the object will be the 
<A NAME="198"></A>same as it is represented to be in each of the definitions, and these representations 
<A NAME="199"></A>are not the same, inasmuch as the definitions are different. Clearly, then, 
<A NAME="200"></A>any one who has not defined a thing through terms that are prior and more 
<A NAME="201"></A>intelligible has not defined it at all.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>The statement that a definition has not been made through more 
<A NAME="203"></A>intelligible terms may be understood in two senses, either supposing that 
<A NAME="204"></A>its terms are absolutely less intelligible, or supposing that they are 
<A NAME="205"></A>less intelligible to us: for either sense is possible. Thus absolutely 
<A NAME="206"></A>the prior is more intelligible than the posterior, a point, for instance, 
<A NAME="207"></A>than a line, a line than a plane, and a plane than a solid; just as also 
<A NAME="208"></A>a unit is more intelligible than a number; for it is the prius and starting-point 
<A NAME="209"></A>of all number. Likewise, also, a letter is more intelligible than a syllable. 
<A NAME="210"></A>Whereas to us it sometimes happens that the converse is the case: for the 
<A NAME="211"></A>solid falls under perception most of all-more than a plane-and a plane 
<A NAME="212"></A>more than a line, and a line more than a point; for most people learn things 
<A NAME="213"></A>like the former earlier than the latter; for any ordinary intelligence 
<A NAME="214"></A>can grasp them, whereas the others require an exact and exceptional 
<A NAME="215"></A>understanding.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>Absolutely, then, it is better to try to make what is posterior 
<A NAME="217"></A>known through what is prior, inasmuch as such a way of procedure is more 
<A NAME="218"></A>scientific. Of course, in dealing with persons who cannot recognize things 
<A NAME="219"></A>through terms of that kind, it may perhaps be necessary to frame the expression 
<A NAME="220"></A>through terms that are intelligible to them. Among definitions of this 
<A NAME="221"></A>kind are those of a point, a line, and a plane, all of which explain the 
<A NAME="222"></A>prior by the posterior; for they say that a point is the limit of a line, 
<A NAME="223"></A>a line of a plane, a plane of a solid. One must, however, not fail to observe 
<A NAME="224"></A>that those who define in this way cannot show the essential nature of the 
<A NAME="225"></A>term they define, unless it so happens that the same thing is more intelligible 
<A NAME="226"></A>both to us and also absolutely, since a correct definition must define 
<A NAME="227"></A>a thing through its genus and its differentiae, and these belong to the 
<A NAME="228"></A>order of things which are absolutely more intelligible than, and prior 
<A NAME="229"></A>to, the species. For annul the genus and differentia, and the species too 
<A NAME="230"></A>is annulled, so that these are prior to the species. They are also more 
<A NAME="231"></A>intelligible; for if the species be known, the genus and differentia must 
<A NAME="232"></A>of necessity be known as well (for any one who knows what a man is knows 
<A NAME="233"></A>also what 'animal' and 'walking' are), whereas if the genus or the differentia 
<A NAME="234"></A>be known it does not follow of necessity that the species is known as well: 
<A NAME="235"></A>thus the species is less intelligible. Moreover, those who say that such 
<A NAME="236"></A>definitions, viz. those which proceed from what is intelligible to this, 
<A NAME="237"></A>that, or the other man, are really and truly definitions, will have to 
<A NAME="238"></A>say that there are several definitions of one and the same thing. For, 
<A NAME="239"></A>as it happens, different things are more intelligible to different people, 
<A NAME="240"></A>not the same things to all; and so a different definition would have to 
<A NAME="241"></A>be rendered to each several person, if the definition is to be constructed 
<A NAME="242"></A>from what is more intelligible to particular individuals. Moreover, to 
<A NAME="243"></A>the same people different things are more intelligible at different times; 
<A NAME="244"></A>first of all the objects of sense; then, as they become more sharpwitted, 
<A NAME="245"></A>the converse; so that those who hold that a definition ought to be rendered 
<A NAME="246"></A>through what is more intelligible to particular individuals would not have 
<A NAME="247"></A>to render the same definition at all times even to the same person. It 
<A NAME="248"></A>is clear, then, that the right way to define is not through terms of that 
<A NAME="249"></A>kind, but through what is absolutely more intelligible: for only in this 
<A NAME="250"></A>way could the definition come always to be one and the same. Perhaps, also, 
<A NAME="251"></A>what is absolutely intelligible is what is intelligible, not to all, but 
<A NAME="252"></A>to those who are in a sound state of understanding, just as what is absolutely 
<A NAME="253"></A>healthy is what is healthy to those in a sound state of body. All such 
<A NAME="254"></A>points as this ought to be made very precise, and made use of in the course 
<A NAME="255"></A>of discussion as occasion requires. The demolition of a definition will 
<A NAME="256"></A>most surely win a general approval if the definer happens to have framed 
<A NAME="257"></A>his expression neither from what is absolutely more intelligible nor yet 
<A NAME="258"></A>from what is so to us.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>One form, then, of the failure to work through more intelligible 
<A NAME="260"></A>terms is the exhibition of the prior through the posterior, as we remarked 
<A NAME="261"></A>before.' Another form occurs if we find that the definition has been rendered 
<A NAME="262"></A>of what is at rest and definite through what is indefinite and in motion: 
<A NAME="263"></A>for what is still and definite is prior to what is indefinite and in 
<A NAME="264"></A>motion.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>Of the failure to use terms that are prior there are three 
<A NAME="266"></A>forms:
<A NAME="267"></A><BR>(1) The first is when an opposite has been defined through its opposite, 
<A NAME="268"></A>e.g.i. good through evil: for opposites are always simultaneous by nature. 
<A NAME="269"></A>Some people think, also, that both are objects of the same science, so 
<A NAME="270"></A>that the one is not even more intelligible than the other. One must, however, 
<A NAME="271"></A>observe that it is perhaps not possible to define some things in any other 
<A NAME="272"></A>way, e.g. the double without the half, and all the terms that are essentially 
<A NAME="273"></A>relative: for in all such cases the essential being is the same as a certain 
<A NAME="274"></A>relation to something, so that it is impossible to understand the one term 
<A NAME="275"></A>without the other, and accordingly in the definition of the one the other 
<A NAME="276"></A>too must be embraced. One ought to learn up all such points as these, and 
<A NAME="277"></A>use them as occasion may seem to require.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>(2) Another is-if he has used the term defined itself. This passes 
<A NAME="279"></A>unobserved when the actual name of the object is not used, e.g. supposing 
<A NAME="280"></A>any one had defined the sun as a star that appears by day'. For in bringing 
<A NAME="281"></A>in 'day' he brings in the sun. To detect errors of this sort, exchange 
<A NAME="282"></A>the word for its definition, e.g. the definition of 'day' as the 'passage 
<A NAME="283"></A>of the sun over the earth'. Clearly, whoever has said 'the passage of the 
<A NAME="284"></A>sun over the earth' has said 'the sun', so that in bringing in the 'day' 
<A NAME="285"></A>he has brought in the sun.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>(3) Again, see if he has defined one coordinate member of a division 
<A NAME="287"></A>by another, e.g. 'an odd number' as 'that which is greater by one than 
<A NAME="288"></A>an even number'. For the co-ordinate members of a division that are derived 
<A NAME="289"></A>from the same genus are simultaneous by nature and 'odd' and 'even' are 
<A NAME="290"></A>such terms: for both are differentiae of number.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>Likewise also, see if he has defined a superior through a subordinate 
<A NAME="292"></A>term, e.g. 'An "even number" is "a number divisible into halves"', or '"the 
<A NAME="293"></A>good" is a "state of virtue" '. For 'half' is derived from 'two', and 'two' 
<A NAME="294"></A>is an even number: virtue also is a kind of good, so that the latter terms 
<A NAME="295"></A>are subordinate to the former. Moreover, in using the subordinate term 
<A NAME="296"></A>one is bound to use the other as well: for whoever employs the term 'virtue' 
<A NAME="297"></A>employs the term 'good', seeing that virtue is a certain kind of good: 
<A NAME="298"></A>likewise, also, whoever employs the term 'half' employs the term 'even', 
<A NAME="299"></A>for to be 'divided in half' means to be divided into two, and two is 
<A NAME="300"></A>even.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="301"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>Generally speaking, then, one commonplace rule relates to the failure 
<A NAME="303"></A>to frame the expression by means of terms that are prior and more intelligible: 
<A NAME="304"></A>and of this the subdivisions are those specified above. A second is, see 
<A NAME="305"></A>whether, though the object is in a genus, it has not been placed in a genus. 
<A NAME="306"></A>This sort of error is always found where the essence of the object does 
<A NAME="307"></A>not stand first in the expression, e.g. the definition of 'body' as 'that 
<A NAME="308"></A>which has three dimensions', or the definition of 'man', supposing any 
<A NAME="309"></A>one to give it, as 'that which knows how to count': for it is not stated 
<A NAME="310"></A>what it is that has three dimensions, or what it is that knows how to count: 
<A NAME="311"></A>whereas the genus is meant to indicate just this, and is submitted first 
<A NAME="312"></A>of the terms in the definition.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see if, while the term to be defined is used in relation 
<A NAME="314"></A>to many things, he has failed to render it in relation to all of them; 
<A NAME="315"></A>as (e.g.) if he define 'grammar' as the 'knowledge how to write from dictation': 
<A NAME="316"></A>for he ought also to say that it is a knowledge how to read as well. For 
<A NAME="317"></A>in rendering it as 'knowledge of writing' has no more defined it than by 
<A NAME="318"></A>rendering it as 'knowledge of reading': neither in fact has succeeded, 
<A NAME="319"></A>but only he who mentions both these things, since it is impossible that 
<A NAME="320"></A>there should be more than one definition of the same thing. It is only, 
<A NAME="321"></A>however, in some cases that what has been said corresponds to the actual 
<A NAME="322"></A>state of things: in some it does not, e.g. all those terms which are not 
<A NAME="323"></A>used essentially in relation to both things: as medicine is said to deal 
<A NAME="324"></A>with the production of disease and health; for it is said essentially to 
<A NAME="325"></A>do the latter, but the former only by accident: for it is absolutely alien 
<A NAME="326"></A>to medicine to produce disease. Here, then, the man who renders medicine 
<A NAME="327"></A>as relative to both of these things has not defined it any better than 
<A NAME="328"></A>he who mentions the one only. In fact he has done it perhaps worse, for 
<A NAME="329"></A>any one else besides the doctor is capable of producing 
<A NAME="330"></A>disease.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, in a case where the term to be defined is used in relation 
<A NAME="332"></A>to several things, see if he has rendered it as relative to the worse rather 
<A NAME="333"></A>than to the better; for every form of knowledge and potentiality is generally 
<A NAME="334"></A>thought to be relative to the best.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>Again, if the thing in question be not placed in its own proper 
<A NAME="336"></A>genus, one must examine it according to the elementary rules in regard 
<A NAME="337"></A>to genera, as has been said before.'
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see if he uses language which transgresses the genera 
<A NAME="339"></A>of the things he defines, defining, e.g. justice as a 'state that produces 
<A NAME="340"></A>equality' or 'distributes what is equal': for by defining it so he passes 
<A NAME="341"></A>outside the sphere of virtue, and so by leaving out the genus of justice 
<A NAME="342"></A>he fails to express its essence: for the essence of a thing must in each 
<A NAME="343"></A>case bring in its genus. It is the same thing if the object be not put 
<A NAME="344"></A>into its nearest genus; for the man who puts it into the nearest one has 
<A NAME="345"></A>stated all the higher genera, seeing that all the higher genera are predicated 
<A NAME="346"></A>of the lower. Either, then, it ought to be put into its nearest genus, 
<A NAME="347"></A>or else to the higher genus all the differentiae ought to be appended whereby 
<A NAME="348"></A>the nearest genus is defined. For then he would not have left out anything: 
<A NAME="349"></A>but would merely have mentioned the subordinate genus by an expression 
<A NAME="350"></A>instead of by name. On the other hand, he who mentions merely the higher 
<A NAME="351"></A>genus by itself, does not state the subordinate genus as well: in saying 
<A NAME="352"></A>'plant' a man does not specify 'a tree'.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="353"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>Again, in regard to the differentiae, we must examine in like manner 
<A NAME="355"></A>whether the differentiae, too, that he has stated be those of the genus. 
<A NAME="356"></A>For if a man has not defined the object by the differentiae peculiar to 
<A NAME="357"></A>it, or has mentioned something such as is utterly incapable of being a 
<A NAME="358"></A>differentia of anything, e.g. 'animal' or 'substance', clearly he has not 
<A NAME="359"></A>defined it at all: for the aforesaid terms do not differentiate anything 
<A NAME="360"></A>at all. Further, we must see whether the differentia stated possesses anything 
<A NAME="361"></A>that is co-ordinate with it in a division; for, if not, clearly the one 
<A NAME="362"></A>stated could not be a differentia of the genus. For a genus is always divided 
<A NAME="363"></A>by differentiae that are co-ordinate members of a division, as, for instance, 
<A NAME="364"></A>by the terms 'walking', 'flying', 'aquatic', and 'biped'. Or see if, though 
<A NAME="365"></A>the contrasted differentia exists, it yet is not true of the genus, for 
<A NAME="366"></A>then, clearly, neither of them could be a differentia of the genus; for 
<A NAME="367"></A>differentiae that are co-ordinates in a division with the differentia of 
<A NAME="368"></A>a thing are all true of the genus to which the thing belongs. Likewise, 
<A NAME="369"></A>also, see if, though it be true, yet the addition of it to the genus fails 
<A NAME="370"></A>to make a species. For then, clearly, this could not be a specific differentia 
<A NAME="371"></A>of the genus: for a specific differentia, if added to the genus, always 
<A NAME="372"></A>makes a species. If, however, this be no true differentia, no more is the 
<A NAME="373"></A>one adduced, seeing that it is a co-ordinate member of a division with 
<A NAME="374"></A>this.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see if he divides the genus by a negation, as those do 
<A NAME="376"></A>who define line as 'length without breadth': for this means simply that 
<A NAME="377"></A>it has not any breadth. The genus will then be found to partake of its 
<A NAME="378"></A>own species: for, since of everything either an affirmation or its negation 
<A NAME="379"></A>is true, length must always either lack breadth or possess it, so that 
<A NAME="380"></A>'length' as well, i.e. the genus of 'line', will be either with or without 
<A NAME="381"></A>breadth. But 'length without breadth' is the definition of a species, as 
<A NAME="382"></A>also is 'length with breadth': for 'without breadth' and 'with breadth' 
<A NAME="383"></A>are differentiae, and the genus and differentia constitute the definition 
<A NAME="384"></A>of the species. Hence the genus would admit of the definition of its species. 
<A NAME="385"></A>Likewise, also, it will admit of the definition of the differentia, seeing 
<A NAME="386"></A>that one or the other of the aforesaid differentiae is of necessity predicated 
<A NAME="387"></A>of the genus. The usefulness of this principle is found in meeting those 
<A NAME="388"></A>who assert the existence of 'Ideas': for if absolute length exist, how 
<A NAME="389"></A>will it be predicable of the genus that it has breadth or that it lacks 
<A NAME="390"></A>it? For one assertion or the other will have to be true of 'length' universally, 
<A NAME="391"></A>if it is to be true of the genus at all: and this is contrary to the fact: 
<A NAME="392"></A>for there exist both lengths which have, and lengths which have not, breadth. 
<A NAME="393"></A>Hence the only people against whom the rule can be employed are those who 
<A NAME="394"></A>assert that a genus is always numerically one; and this is what is done 
<A NAME="395"></A>by those who assert the real existence of the 'Ideas'; for they allege 
<A NAME="396"></A>that absolute length and absolute animal are the genus.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>It may be that in some cases the definer is obliged to employ a 
<A NAME="398"></A>negation as well, e.g. in defining privations. For 'blind' means a thing 
<A NAME="399"></A>which cannot see when its nature is to see. There is no difference between 
<A NAME="400"></A>dividing the genus by a negation, and dividing it by such an affirmation 
<A NAME="401"></A>as is bound to have a negation as its co-ordinate in a division, e.g. supposing 
<A NAME="402"></A>he had defined something as 'length possessed of breadth'; for co-ordinate 
<A NAME="403"></A>in the division with that which is possessed of breadth is that which possesses 
<A NAME="404"></A>no breadth and that only, so that again the genus is divided by a 
<A NAME="405"></A>negation.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR>Again, see if he rendered the species as a differentia, as do those 
<A NAME="407"></A>who define 'contumely' as 'insolence accompanied by jeering'; for jeering 
<A NAME="408"></A>is a kind of insolence, i.e. it is a species and not a 
<A NAME="409"></A>differentia.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see if he has stated the genus as the differentia, e.g. 
<A NAME="411"></A>'Virtue is a good or noble state: for 'good' is the genus of 'virtue'. 
<A NAME="412"></A>Or possibly 'good' here is not the genus but the differentia, on the principle 
<A NAME="413"></A>that the same thing cannot be in two genera of which neither contains the 
<A NAME="414"></A>other: for 'good' does not include 'state', nor vice versa: for not every 
<A NAME="415"></A>state is good nor every good a 'state'. Both, then, could not be genera, 
<A NAME="416"></A>and consequently, if 'state' is the genus of virtue, clearly 'good' cannot 
<A NAME="417"></A>be its genus: it must rather be the differentia'. Moreover, 'a state' indicates 
<A NAME="418"></A>the essence of virtue, whereas 'good' indicates not the essence but a quality: 
<A NAME="419"></A>and to indicate a quality is generally held to be the function of the differentia. 
<A NAME="420"></A>See, further, whether the differentia rendered indicates an individual 
<A NAME="421"></A>rather than a quality: for the general view is that the differentia always 
<A NAME="422"></A>expresses a quality.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>Look and see, further, whether the differentia belongs only by 
<A NAME="424"></A>accident to the object defined. For the differentia is never an accidental 
<A NAME="425"></A>attribute, any more than the genus is: for the differentia of a thing cannot 
<A NAME="426"></A>both belong and not belong to it.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, if either the differentia or the species, or any of the 
<A NAME="428"></A>things which are under the species, is predicable of the genus, then he 
<A NAME="429"></A>could not have defined the term. For none of the aforesaid can possibly 
<A NAME="430"></A>be predicated of the genus, seeing that the genus is the term with the 
<A NAME="431"></A>widest range of all. Again, see if the genus be predicated of the differentia; 
<A NAME="432"></A>for the general view is that the genus is predicated, not of the differentia, 
<A NAME="433"></A>but of the objects of which the differentia is predicated. Animal (e.g.) 
<A NAME="434"></A>is predicated of 'man' or 'ox' or other walking animals, not of the actual 
<A NAME="435"></A>differentia itself which we predicate of the species. For if 'animal' is 
<A NAME="436"></A>to be predicated of each of its differentiae, then 'animal' would be predicated 
<A NAME="437"></A>of the species several times over; for the differentiae are predicates 
<A NAME="438"></A>of the species. Moreover, the differentiae will be all either species or 
<A NAME="439"></A>individuals, if they are animals; for every animal is either a species 
<A NAME="440"></A>or an individual.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>Likewise you must inquire also if the species or any of the objects 
<A NAME="442"></A>that come under it is predicated of the differentia: for this is impossible, 
<A NAME="443"></A>seeing that the differentia is a term with a wider range than the various 
<A NAME="444"></A>species. Moreover, if any of the species be predicated of it, the result 
<A NAME="445"></A>will be that the differentia is a species: if, for instance, 'man' be predicated, 
<A NAME="446"></A>the differentia is clearly the human race. Again, see if the differentia 
<A NAME="447"></A>fails to be prior to the species: for the differentia ought to be posterior 
<A NAME="448"></A>to the genus, but prior to the species.
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR>Look and see also if the differentia mentioned belongs to a different 
<A NAME="450"></A>genus, neither contained in nor containing the genus in question. For the 
<A NAME="451"></A>general view is that the same differentia cannot be used of two non-subaltern 
<A NAME="452"></A>genera. Else the result will be that the same species as well will be in 
<A NAME="453"></A>two non-subaltern genera: for each of the differentiae imports its own 
<A NAME="454"></A>genus, e.g. 'walking' and 'biped' import with them the genus 'animal'. 
<A NAME="455"></A>If, then, each of the genera as well is true of that of which the differentia 
<A NAME="456"></A>is true, it clearly follows that the species must be in two non-subaltern 
<A NAME="457"></A>genera. Or perhaps it is not impossible for the same differentia to be 
<A NAME="458"></A>used of two non-subaltern genera, and we ought to add the words 'except 
<A NAME="459"></A>they both be subordinate members of the same genus'. Thus 'walking animal' 
<A NAME="460"></A>and 'flying animal' are non-subaltern genera, and 'biped' is the differentia 
<A NAME="461"></A>of both. The words 'except they both be subordinate members of the same 
<A NAME="462"></A>genus' ought therefore to be added; for both these are subordinate to 'animal'. 
<A NAME="463"></A>From this possibility, that the same differentia may be used of two non-subaltern 
<A NAME="464"></A>genera, it is clear also that there is no necessity for the differentia 
<A NAME="465"></A>to carry with it the whole of the genus to which it belongs, but only the 
<A NAME="466"></A>one or the other of its limbs together with the genera that are higher 
<A NAME="467"></A>than this, as 'biped' carries with it either 'flying' or 'walking 
<A NAME="468"></A>animal'.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>See, too, if he has rendered 'existence in' something as the differentia 
<A NAME="470"></A>of a thing's essence: for the general view is that locality cannot differentiate 
<A NAME="471"></A>between one essence and another. Hence, too, people condemn those who divide 
<A NAME="472"></A>animals by means of the terms 'walking' and 'aquatic', on the ground that 
<A NAME="473"></A>'walking' and 'aquatic' indicate mere locality. Or possibly in this case 
<A NAME="474"></A>the censure is undeserved; for 'aquatic' does not mean 'in' anything; nor 
<A NAME="475"></A>does it denote a locality, but a certain quality: for even if the thing 
<A NAME="476"></A>be on the dry land, still it is aquatic: and likewise a land-animal, even 
<A NAME="477"></A>though it be in the water, will still be a and not an aquatic-animal. But 
<A NAME="478"></A>all the same, if ever the differentia does denote existence in something, 
<A NAME="479"></A>clearly he will have made a bad mistake.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR>Again, see if he has rendered an affection as the differentia: 
<A NAME="481"></A>for every affection, if intensified, subverts the essence of the thing, 
<A NAME="482"></A>while the differentia is not of that kind: for the differentia is generally 
<A NAME="483"></A>considered rather to preserve that which it differentiates; and it is absolutely 
<A NAME="484"></A>impossible for a thing to exist without its own special differentia: for 
<A NAME="485"></A>if there be no 'walking', there will be no 'man'. In fact, we may lay down 
<A NAME="486"></A>absolutely that a thing cannot have as its differentia anything in respect 
<A NAME="487"></A>of which it is subject to alteration: for all things of that kind, if intensified, 
<A NAME="488"></A>destroy its essence. If, then, a man has rendered any differentia of this 
<A NAME="489"></A>kind, he has made a mistake: for we undergo absolutely no alteration in 
<A NAME="490"></A>respect of our differentiae.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>Again, see if he has failed to render the differentia of a relative 
<A NAME="492"></A>term relatively to something else; for the differentiae of relative terms 
<A NAME="493"></A>are themselves relative, as in the case also of knowledge. This is classed 
<A NAME="494"></A>as speculative, practical and productive; and each of these denotes a relation: 
<A NAME="495"></A>for it speculates upon something, and produces something and does 
<A NAME="496"></A>something.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR>Look and see also if the definer renders each relative term relatively 
<A NAME="498"></A>to its natural purpose: for while in some cases the particular relative 
<A NAME="499"></A>term can be used in relation to its natural purpose only and to nothing 
<A NAME="500"></A>else, some can be used in relation to something else as well. Thus sight 
<A NAME="501"></A>can only be used for seeing, but a strigil can also be used to dip up water. 
<A NAME="502"></A>Still, if any one were to define a strigil as an instrument for dipping 
<A NAME="503"></A>water, he has made a mistake: for that is not its natural function. The 
<A NAME="504"></A>definition of a thing's natural function is 'that for which it would be 
<A NAME="505"></A>used by the prudent man, acting as such, and by the science that deals 
<A NAME="506"></A>specially with that thing'.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>Or see if, whenever a term happens to be used in a number of relations, 
<A NAME="508"></A>he has failed to introduce it in its primary relation: e.g. by defining 
<A NAME="509"></A>'wisdom' as the virtue of 'man' or of the 'soul,' rather than of the 'reasoning 
<A NAME="510"></A>faculty': for 'wisdom' is the virtue primarily of the reasoning faculty: 
<A NAME="511"></A>for it is in virtue of this that both the man and his soul are said to 
<A NAME="512"></A>be wise.
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, if the thing of which the term defined has been stated 
<A NAME="514"></A>to be an affection or disposition, or whatever it may be, be unable to 
<A NAME="515"></A>admit it, the definer has made a mistake. For every disposition and every 
<A NAME="516"></A>affection is formed naturally in that of which it is an affection or disposition, 
<A NAME="517"></A>as knowledge, too, is formed in the soul, being a disposition of soul. 
<A NAME="518"></A>Sometimes, however, people make bad mistakes in matters of this sort, e.g. 
<A NAME="519"></A>all those who say that 'sleep' is a 'failure of sensation', or that 'perplexity' 
<A NAME="520"></A>is a state of 'equality between contrary reasonings', or that 'pain' is 
<A NAME="521"></A>a 'violent disruption of parts that are naturally conjoined'. For sleep 
<A NAME="522"></A>is not an attribute of sensation, whereas it ought to be, if it is a failure 
<A NAME="523"></A>of sensation. Likewise, perplexity is not an attribute of opposite reasonings, 
<A NAME="524"></A>nor pain of parts naturally conjoined: for then inanimate things will be 
<A NAME="525"></A>in pain, since pain will be present in them. Similar in character, too, 
<A NAME="526"></A>is the definition of 'health', say, as a 'balance of hot and cold elements': 
<A NAME="527"></A>for then health will be necessarily exhibited by the hot and cold elements: 
<A NAME="528"></A>for balance of anything is an attribute inherent in those things of which 
<A NAME="529"></A>it is the balance, so that health would be an attribute of them. Moreover, 
<A NAME="530"></A>people who define in this way put effect for cause, or cause for effect. 
<A NAME="531"></A>For the disruption of parts naturally conjoined is not pain, but only a 
<A NAME="532"></A>cause of pain: nor again is a failure of sensation sleep, but the one is 
<A NAME="533"></A>the cause of the other: for either we go to sleep because sensation fails, 
<A NAME="534"></A>or sensation fails because we go to sleep. Likewise also an equality between 
<A NAME="535"></A>contrary reasonings would be generally considered to be a cause of perplexity: 
<A NAME="536"></A>for it is when we reflect on both sides of a question and find everything 
<A NAME="537"></A>alike to be in keeping with either course that we are perplexed which of 
<A NAME="538"></A>the two we are to do.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, with regard to all periods of time look and see whether 
<A NAME="540"></A>there be any discrepancy between the differentia and the thing defined: 
<A NAME="541"></A>e.g. supposing the 'immortal' to be defined as a 'living thing immune at 
<A NAME="542"></A>present from destruction'. For a living thing that is immune 'at present' 
<A NAME="543"></A>from destruction will be immortal 'at present'. Possibly, indeed, in this 
<A NAME="544"></A>case this result does not follow, owing to the ambiguity of the words 'immune 
<A NAME="545"></A>at present from destruction': for it may mean either that the thing has 
<A NAME="546"></A>not been destroyed at present, or that it cannot be destroyed at present, 
<A NAME="547"></A>or that at present it is such that it never can be destroyed. Whenever, 
<A NAME="548"></A>then, we say that a living thing is at present immune from destruction, 
<A NAME="549"></A>we mean that it is at present a living thing of such a kind as never to 
<A NAME="550"></A>be destroyed: and this is equivalent to saying that it is immortal, so 
<A NAME="551"></A>that it is not meant that it is immortal only at present. Still, if ever 
<A NAME="552"></A>it does happen that what has been rendered according to the definition 
<A NAME="553"></A>belongs in the present only or past, whereas what is meant by the word 
<A NAME="554"></A>does not so belong, then the two could not be the same. So, then, this 
<A NAME="555"></A>commonplace rule ought to be followed, as we have said.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="556"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>You should look and see also whether the term being defined is 
<A NAME="558"></A>applied in consideration of something other than the definition rendered. 
<A NAME="559"></A>Suppose (e.g.) a definition of 'justice' as the 'ability to distribute 
<A NAME="560"></A>what is equal'. This would not be right, for 'just' describes rather the 
<A NAME="561"></A>man who chooses, than the man who is able to distribute what is equal: 
<A NAME="562"></A>so that justice could not be an ability to distribute what is equal: for 
<A NAME="563"></A>then also the most just man would be the man with the most ability to distribute 
<A NAME="564"></A>what is equal.
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see if the thing admits of degrees, whereas what is rendered 
<A NAME="566"></A>according to the definition does not, or, vice versa, what is rendered 
<A NAME="567"></A>according to the definition admits of degrees while the thing does not. 
<A NAME="568"></A>For either both must admit them or else neither, if indeed what is rendered 
<A NAME="569"></A>according to the definition is the same as the thing. Moreover, see if, 
<A NAME="570"></A>while both of them admit of degrees, they yet do not both become greater 
<A NAME="571"></A>together: e.g. suppose sexual love to be the desire for intercourse: for 
<A NAME="572"></A>he who is more intensely in love has not a more intense desire for intercourse, 
<A NAME="573"></A>so that both do not become intensified at once: they certainly should, 
<A NAME="574"></A>however, had they been the same thing.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, suppose two things to be before you, see if the term 
<A NAME="576"></A>to be defined applies more particularly to the one to which the content 
<A NAME="577"></A>of the definition is less applicable. Take, for instance, the definition 
<A NAME="578"></A>of 'fire' as the 'body that consists of the most rarefied particles'. For 
<A NAME="579"></A>'fire' denotes flame rather than light, but flame is less the body that 
<A NAME="580"></A>consists of the most rarefied particles than is light: whereas both ought 
<A NAME="581"></A>to be more applicable to the same thing, if they had been the same. Again, 
<A NAME="582"></A>see if the one expression applies alike to both the objects before you, 
<A NAME="583"></A>while the other does not apply to both alike, but more particularly to 
<A NAME="584"></A>one of them.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see if he renders the definition relative to two things 
<A NAME="586"></A>taken separately: thus, the beautiful' is 'what is pleasant to the eyes 
<A NAME="587"></A>or to the ears": or 'the real' is 'what is capable of being acted upon 
<A NAME="588"></A>or of acting'. For then the same thing will be both beautiful and not beautiful, 
<A NAME="589"></A>and likewise will be both real and not real. For 'pleasant to the ears' 
<A NAME="590"></A>will be the same as 'beautiful', so that 'not pleasant to the ears' will 
<A NAME="591"></A>be the same as 'not beautiful': for of identical things the opposites, 
<A NAME="592"></A>too, are identical, and the opposite of 'beautiful' is 'not beautiful', 
<A NAME="593"></A>while of 'pleasant to the ears' the opposite is not pleasant to the cars': 
<A NAME="594"></A>clearly, then, 'not pleasant to the ears' is the same thing as 'not beautiful'. 
<A NAME="595"></A>If, therefore, something be pleasant to the eyes but not to the ears, it 
<A NAME="596"></A>will be both beautiful and not beautiful. In like manner we shall show 
<A NAME="597"></A>also that the same thing is both real and unreal.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, of both genera and differentiae and all the other terms 
<A NAME="599"></A>rendered in definitions you should frame definitions in lieu of the terms, 
<A NAME="600"></A>and then see if there be any discrepancy between them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="601"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR>If the term defined be relative, either in itself or in respect 
<A NAME="603"></A>of its genus, see whether the definition fails to mention that to which 
<A NAME="604"></A>the term, either in itself or in respect of its genus, is relative, e.g. 
<A NAME="605"></A>if he has defined 'knowledge' as an 'incontrovertible conception' or 'wishing' 
<A NAME="606"></A>as 'painless conation'. For of everything relative the essence is relative 
<A NAME="607"></A>to something else, seeing that the being of every relative term is identical 
<A NAME="608"></A>with being in a certain relation to something. He ought, therefore, to 
<A NAME="609"></A>have said that knowledge is 'conception of a knowable' and that wishing 
<A NAME="610"></A>is 'conation for a good'. Likewise, also, if he has defined 'grammar' as 
<A NAME="611"></A>'knowledge of letters': whereas in the definition there ought to be rendered 
<A NAME="612"></A>either the thing to which the term itself is relative, or that, whatever 
<A NAME="613"></A>it is, to which its genus is relative. Or see if a relative term has been 
<A NAME="614"></A>described not in relation to its end, the end in anything being whatever 
<A NAME="615"></A>is best in it or gives its purpose to the rest. Certainly it is what is 
<A NAME="616"></A>best or final that should be stated, e.g. that desire is not for the pleasant 
<A NAME="617"></A>but for pleasure: for this is our purpose in choosing what is pleasant 
<A NAME="618"></A>as well.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>Look and see also if that in relation to which he has rendered 
<A NAME="620"></A>the term be a process or an activity: for nothing of that kind is an end, 
<A NAME="621"></A>for the completion of the activity or process is the end rather than the 
<A NAME="622"></A>process or activity itself. Or perhaps this rule is not true in all cases, 
<A NAME="623"></A>for almost everybody prefers the present experience of pleasure to its 
<A NAME="624"></A>cessation, so that they would count the activity as the end rather than 
<A NAME="625"></A>its completion.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>Again see in some cases if he has failed to distinguish the quantity 
<A NAME="627"></A>or quality or place or other differentiae of an object; e.g. the quality 
<A NAME="628"></A>and quantity of the honour the striving for which makes a man ambitious: 
<A NAME="629"></A>for all men strive for honour, so that it is not enough to define the ambitious 
<A NAME="630"></A>man as him who strives for honour, but the aforesaid differentiae must 
<A NAME="631"></A>be added. Likewise, also, in defining the covetous man the quantity of 
<A NAME="632"></A>money he aims at, or in the case of the incontinent man the quality of 
<A NAME="633"></A>the pleasures, should be stated. For it is not the man who gives way to 
<A NAME="634"></A>any sort of pleasure whatever who is called incontinent, but only he who 
<A NAME="635"></A>gives way to a certain kind of pleasure. Or again, people sometimes define 
<A NAME="636"></A>night as a 'shadow on the earth', or an earthquake as a movement of the 
<A NAME="637"></A>earth', or a cloud as 'condensation of the air', or a wind as a 'movement 
<A NAME="638"></A>of the air'; whereas they ought to specify as well quantity, quality, place, 
<A NAME="639"></A>and cause. Likewise, also, in other cases of the kind: for by omitting 
<A NAME="640"></A>any differentiae whatever he fails to state the essence of the term. One 
<A NAME="641"></A>should always attack deficiency. For a movement of the earth does not constitute 
<A NAME="642"></A>an earthquake, nor a movement of the air a wind, irrespective of its manner 
<A NAME="643"></A>and the amount involved.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, in the case of conations, and in any other cases where 
<A NAME="645"></A>it applies, see if the word 'apparent' is left out, e.g. 'wishing is a 
<A NAME="646"></A>conation after the good', or 'desire is a conation after the pleasant'-instead 
<A NAME="647"></A>of saying 'the apparently good', or 'pleasant'. For often those who exhibit 
<A NAME="648"></A>the conation do not perceive what is good or pleasant, so that their aim 
<A NAME="649"></A>need not be really good or pleasant, but only apparently so. They ought, 
<A NAME="650"></A>therefore, to have rendered the definition also accordingly. On the other 
<A NAME="651"></A>hand, any one who maintains the existence of Ideas ought to be brought 
<A NAME="652"></A>face to face with his Ideas, even though he does render the word in question: 
<A NAME="653"></A>for there can be no Idea of anything merely apparent: the general view 
<A NAME="654"></A>is that an Idea is always spoken of in relation to an Idea: thus absolute 
<A NAME="655"></A>desire is for the absolutely pleasant, and absolute wishing is for the 
<A NAME="656"></A>absolutely good; they therefore cannot be for an apparent good or an apparently 
<A NAME="657"></A>pleasant: for the existence of an absolutely-apparently-good or pleasant 
<A NAME="658"></A>would be an absurdity.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="659"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, if the definition be of the state of anything, look at 
<A NAME="661"></A>what is in the state, while if it be of what is in the state, look at the 
<A NAME="662"></A>state: and likewise also in other cases of the kind. Thus if the pleasant 
<A NAME="663"></A>be identical with the beneficial, then, too, the man who is pleased is 
<A NAME="664"></A>benefited. Speaking generally, in definitions of this sort it happens that 
<A NAME="665"></A>what the definer defines is in a sense more than one thing: for in defining 
<A NAME="666"></A>knowledge, a man in a sense defines ignorance as well, and likewise also 
<A NAME="667"></A>what has knowledge and what lacks it, and what it is to know and to be 
<A NAME="668"></A>ignorant. For if the first be made clear, the others become in a certain 
<A NAME="669"></A>sense clear as well. We have, then, to be on our guard in all such cases 
<A NAME="670"></A>against discrepancy, using the elementary principles drawn from consideration 
<A NAME="671"></A>of contraries and of coordinates.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, in the case of relative terms, see if the species is 
<A NAME="673"></A>rendered as relative to a species of that to which the genus is rendered 
<A NAME="674"></A>as relative, e.g. supposing belief to be relative to some object of belief, 
<A NAME="675"></A>see whether a particular belief is made relative to some particular object 
<A NAME="676"></A>of belief: and, if a multiple be relative to a fraction, see whether a 
<A NAME="677"></A>particular multiple be made relative to a particular fraction. For if it 
<A NAME="678"></A>be not so rendered, clearly a mistake has been made.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>See, also, if the opposite of the term has the opposite definition, 
<A NAME="680"></A>whether (e.g.) the definition of 'half' is the opposite of that of 'double': 
<A NAME="681"></A>for if 'double' is 'that which exceeds another by an equal amount to that 
<A NAME="682"></A>other', 'half' is 'that which is exceeded by an amount equal to itself'. 
<A NAME="683"></A>In the same way, too, with contraries. For to the contrary term will apply 
<A NAME="684"></A>the definition that is contrary in some one of the ways in which contraries 
<A NAME="685"></A>are conjoined. Thus (e.g.) if 'useful'='productive of good', 'injurious'=productive 
<A NAME="686"></A>of evil' or 'destructive of good', for one or the other of thee is bound 
<A NAME="687"></A>to be contrary to the term originally used. Suppose, then, neither of these 
<A NAME="688"></A>things to be the contrary of the term originally used, then clearly neither 
<A NAME="689"></A>of the definitions rendered later could be the definition of the contrary 
<A NAME="690"></A>of the term originally defined: and therefore the definition originally 
<A NAME="691"></A>rendered of the original term has not been rightly rendered either. Seeing, 
<A NAME="692"></A>moreover, that of contraries, the one is sometimes a word forced to denote 
<A NAME="693"></A>the privation of the other, as (e.g.) inequality is generally held to be 
<A NAME="694"></A>the privation of equality (for 'unequal' merely describes things that are 
<A NAME="695"></A>not equal'), it is therefore clear that that contrary whose form denotes 
<A NAME="696"></A>the privation must of necessity be defined through the other; whereas the 
<A NAME="697"></A>other cannot then be defined through the one whose form denotes the privation; 
<A NAME="698"></A>for else we should find that each is being interpreted by the other. We 
<A NAME="699"></A>must in the case of contrary terms keep an eye on this mistake, e.g. supposing 
<A NAME="700"></A>any one were to define equality as the contrary of inequality: for then 
<A NAME="701"></A>he is defining it through the term which denotes privation of it. Moreover, 
<A NAME="702"></A>a man who so defines is bound to use in his definition the very term he 
<A NAME="703"></A>is defining; and this becomes clear, if for the word we substitute its 
<A NAME="704"></A>definition. For to say 'inequality' is the same as to say 'privation of 
<A NAME="705"></A>equality'. Therefore equality so defined will be 'the contrary of the privation 
<A NAME="706"></A>of equality', so that he would have used the very word to be defined. Suppose, 
<A NAME="707"></A>however, that neither of the contraries be so formed as to denote privation, 
<A NAME="708"></A>but yet the definition of it be rendered in a manner like the above, e.g. 
<A NAME="709"></A>suppose 'good' to be defined as 'the contrary of evil', then, since it 
<A NAME="710"></A>is clear that 'evil' too will be 'the contrary of good' (for the definition 
<A NAME="711"></A>of things that are contrary in this must be rendered in a like manner), 
<A NAME="712"></A>the result again is that he uses the very term being defined: for 'good' 
<A NAME="713"></A>is inherent in the definition of 'evil'. If, then, 'good' be the contrary 
<A NAME="714"></A>of evil, and evil be nothing other than the 'contrary of good', then 'good' 
<A NAME="715"></A>will be the 'contrary of the contrary of good'. Clearly, then, he has used 
<A NAME="716"></A>the very word to be defined.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see if in rendering a term formed to denote privation, 
<A NAME="718"></A>he has failed to render the term of which it is the privation, e.g. the 
<A NAME="719"></A>state, or contrary, or whatever it may be whose privation it is: also if 
<A NAME="720"></A>he has omitted to add either any term at all in which the privation is 
<A NAME="721"></A>naturally formed, or else that in which it is naturally formed primarily, 
<A NAME="722"></A>e.g. whether in defining 'ignorance' a privation he has failed to say that 
<A NAME="723"></A>it is the privation of 'knowledge'; or has failed to add in what it is 
<A NAME="724"></A>naturally formed, or, though he has added this, has failed to render the 
<A NAME="725"></A>thing in which it is primarily formed, placing it (e.g.) in 'man' or in 
<A NAME="726"></A>'the soul', and not in the 'reasoning faculty': for if in any of these 
<A NAME="727"></A>respects he fails, he has made a mistake. Likewise, also, if he has failed 
<A NAME="728"></A>to say that 'blindness' is the 'privation of sight in an eye': for a proper 
<A NAME="729"></A>rendering of its essence must state both of what it is the privation and 
<A NAME="730"></A>what it is that is deprived.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>Examine further whether he has defined by the expression 'a privation' 
<A NAME="732"></A>a term that is not used to denote a privation: thus a mistake of this sort 
<A NAME="733"></A>also would be generally thought to be incurred in the case of 'error' by 
<A NAME="734"></A>any one who is not using it as a merely negative term. For what is generally 
<A NAME="735"></A>thought to be in error is not that which has no knowledge, but rather that 
<A NAME="736"></A>which has been deceived, and for this reason we do not talk of inanimate 
<A NAME="737"></A>things or of children as 'erring'. 'Error', then, is not used to denote 
<A NAME="738"></A>a mere privation of knowledge.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="739"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see whether the like inflexions in the definition apply 
<A NAME="741"></A>to the like inflexions of the term; e.g. if 'beneficial' means 'productive 
<A NAME="742"></A>of health', does 'beneficially' mean productively of health' and a 'benefactor' 
<A NAME="743"></A>a 'producer of health'?
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR>Look too and see whether the definition given will apply to the 
<A NAME="745"></A>Idea as well. For in some cases it will not do so; e.g. in the Platonic 
<A NAME="746"></A>definition where he adds the word 'mortal' in his definitions of living 
<A NAME="747"></A>creatures: for the Idea (e.g. the absolute Man) is not mortal, so that 
<A NAME="748"></A>the definition will not fit the Idea. So always wherever the words 'capable 
<A NAME="749"></A>of acting on' or 'capable of being acted upon' are added, the definition 
<A NAME="750"></A>and the Idea are absolutely bound to be discrepant: for those who assert 
<A NAME="751"></A>the existence of Ideas hold that they are incapable of being acted upon, 
<A NAME="752"></A>or of motion. In dealing with these people even arguments of this kind 
<A NAME="753"></A>are useful.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>Further, see if he has rendered a single common definition of terms 
<A NAME="755"></A>that are used ambiguously. For terms whose definition corresponding their 
<A NAME="756"></A>common name is one and the same, are synonymous; if, then, the definition 
<A NAME="757"></A>applies in a like manner to the whole range of the ambiguous term, it is 
<A NAME="758"></A>not true of any one of the objects described by the term. This is, moreover, 
<A NAME="759"></A>what happens to Dionysius' definition of 'life' when stated as 'a movement 
<A NAME="760"></A>of a creature sustained by nutriment, congenitally present with it': for 
<A NAME="761"></A>this is found in plants as much as in animals, whereas 'life' is generally 
<A NAME="762"></A>understood to mean not one kind of thing only, but to be one thing in animals 
<A NAME="763"></A>and another in plants. It is possible to hold the view that life is a synonymous 
<A NAME="764"></A>term and is always used to describe one thing only, and therefore to render 
<A NAME="765"></A>the definition in this way on purpose: or it may quite well happen that 
<A NAME="766"></A>a man may see the ambiguous character of the word, and wish to render the 
<A NAME="767"></A>definition of the one sense only, and yet fail to see that he has rendered 
<A NAME="768"></A>a definition common to both senses instead of one peculiar to the sense 
<A NAME="769"></A>he intends. In either case, whichever course he pursues, he is equally 
<A NAME="770"></A>at fault. Since ambiguous terms sometimes pass unobserved, it is best in 
<A NAME="771"></A>questioning to treat such terms as though they were synonymous (for the 
<A NAME="772"></A>definition of the one sense will not apply to the other, so that the answerer 
<A NAME="773"></A>will be generally thought not to have defined it correctly, for to a synonymous 
<A NAME="774"></A>term the definition should apply in its full range), whereas in answering 
<A NAME="775"></A>you should yourself distinguish between the senses. Further, as some answerers 
<A NAME="776"></A>call 'ambiguous' what is really synonymous, whenever the definition rendered 
<A NAME="777"></A>fails to apply universally, and, vice versa, call synonymous what is really 
<A NAME="778"></A>ambiguous supposing their definition applies to both senses of the term, 
<A NAME="779"></A>one should secure a preliminary admission on such points, or else prove 
<A NAME="780"></A>beforehand that so-and-so is ambiguous or synonymous, as the case may be: 
<A NAME="781"></A>for people are more ready to agree when they do not foresee what the consequence 
<A NAME="782"></A>will be. If, however, no admission has been made, and the man asserts that 
<A NAME="783"></A>what is really synonymous is ambiguous because the definition he has rendered 
<A NAME="784"></A>will not apply to the second sense as well, see if the definition of this 
<A NAME="785"></A>second meaning applies also to the other meanings: for if so, this meaning 
<A NAME="786"></A>must clearly be synonymous with those others. Otherwise, there will be 
<A NAME="787"></A>more than one definition of those other meanings, for there are applicable 
<A NAME="788"></A>to them two distinct definitions in explanation of the term, viz. the one 
<A NAME="789"></A>previously rendered and also the later one. Again, if any one were to define 
<A NAME="790"></A>a term used in several senses, and, finding that his definition does not 
<A NAME="791"></A>apply to them all, were to contend not that the term is ambiguous, but 
<A NAME="792"></A>that even the term does not properly apply to all those senses, just because 
<A NAME="793"></A>his definition will not do so either, then one may retort to such a man 
<A NAME="794"></A>that though in some things one must not use the language of the people, 
<A NAME="795"></A>yet in a question of terminology one is bound to employ the received and 
<A NAME="796"></A>traditional usage and not to upset matters of that sort.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="797"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR>Suppose now that a definition has been rendered of some complex 
<A NAME="799"></A>term, take away the definition of one of the elements in the complex, and 
<A NAME="800"></A>see if also the rest of the definition defines the rest of it: if not, 
<A NAME="801"></A>it is clear that neither does the whole definition define the whole complex. 
<A NAME="802"></A>Suppose, e.g. that some one has defined a 'finite straight line' as 'the 
<A NAME="803"></A>limit of a finite plane, such that its centre is in a line with its extremes'; 
<A NAME="804"></A>if now the definition of a finite line' be the 'limit of a finite plane', 
<A NAME="805"></A>the rest (viz. 'such that its centre is in a line with its extremes') ought 
<A NAME="806"></A>to be a definition of straight'. But an infinite straight line has neither 
<A NAME="807"></A>centre nor extremes and yet is straight so that this remainder does not 
<A NAME="808"></A>define the remainder of the term.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, if the term defined be a compound notion, see if the 
<A NAME="810"></A>definition rendered be equimembral with the term defined. A definition 
<A NAME="811"></A>is said to be equimembral with the term defined when the number of the 
<A NAME="812"></A>elements compounded in the latter is the same as the number of nouns and 
<A NAME="813"></A>verbs in the definition. For the exchange in such cases is bound to be 
<A NAME="814"></A>merely one of term for term, in the case of some if not of all, seeing 
<A NAME="815"></A>that there are no more terms used now than formerly; whereas in a definition 
<A NAME="816"></A>terms ought to be rendered by phrases, if possible in every case, or if 
<A NAME="817"></A>not, in the majority. For at that rate, simple objects too could be defined 
<A NAME="818"></A>by merely calling them by a different name, e.g. 'cloak' instead of 
<A NAME="819"></A>'doublet'.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR>The mistake is even worse, if actually a less well known term be 
<A NAME="821"></A>substituted, e.g. 'pellucid mortal' for 'white man': for it is no definition, 
<A NAME="822"></A>and moreover is less intelligible when put in that form.
<A NAME="823"></A><BR><BR>Look and see also whether, in the exchange of words, the sense 
<A NAME="824"></A>fails still to be the same. Take, for instance, the explanation of 'speculative 
<A NAME="825"></A>knowledge' as 'speculative conception': for conception is not the same 
<A NAME="826"></A>as knowledge-as it certainly ought to be if the whole is to be the same 
<A NAME="827"></A>too: for though the word 'speculative' is common to both expressions, yet 
<A NAME="828"></A>the remainder is different.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see if in replacing one of the terms by something else 
<A NAME="830"></A>he has exchanged the genus and not the differentia, as in the example just 
<A NAME="831"></A>given: for 'speculative' is a less familiar term than knowledge; for the 
<A NAME="832"></A>one is the genus and the other the differentia, and the genus is always 
<A NAME="833"></A>the most familiar term of all; so that it is not this, but the differentia, 
<A NAME="834"></A>that ought to have been changed, seeing that it is the less familiar. It 
<A NAME="835"></A>might be held that this criticism is ridiculous: because there is no reason 
<A NAME="836"></A>why the most familiar term should not describe the differentia, and not 
<A NAME="837"></A>the genus; in which case, clearly, the term to be altered would also be 
<A NAME="838"></A>that denoting the genus and not the differentia. If, however, a man is 
<A NAME="839"></A>substituting for a term not merely another term but a phrase, clearly it 
<A NAME="840"></A>is of the differentia rather than of the genus that a definition should 
<A NAME="841"></A>be rendered, seeing that the object of rendering the definition is to make 
<A NAME="842"></A>the subject familiar; for the differentia is less familiar than the 
<A NAME="843"></A>genus.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR><BR>If he has rendered the definition of the differentia, see whether 
<A NAME="845"></A>the definition rendered is common to it and something else as well: e.g. 
<A NAME="846"></A>whenever he says that an odd number is a 'number with a middle', further 
<A NAME="847"></A>definition is required of how it has a middle: for the word 'number' is 
<A NAME="848"></A>common to both expressions, and it is the word 'odd' for which the phrase 
<A NAME="849"></A>has been substituted. Now both a line and a body have a middle, yet they 
<A NAME="850"></A>are not 'odd'; so that this could not be a definition of 'odd'. If, on 
<A NAME="851"></A>the other hand, the phrase 'with a middle' be used in several senses, the 
<A NAME="852"></A>sense here intended requires to be defined. So that this will either discredit 
<A NAME="853"></A>the definition or prove that it is no definition at 
<A NAME="854"></A>all.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="855"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR>Again, see if the term of which he renders the definition is a 
<A NAME="857"></A>reality, whereas what is contained in the definition is not, e.g. Suppose 
<A NAME="858"></A>'white' to be defined as 'colour mingled with fire': for what is bodiless 
<A NAME="859"></A>cannot be mingled with body, so that 'colour' 'mingled with fire' could 
<A NAME="860"></A>not exist, whereas 'white' does exist.
<A NAME="861"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, those who in the case of relative terms do not distinguish 
<A NAME="862"></A>to what the object is related, but have described it only so as to include 
<A NAME="863"></A>it among too large a number of things, are wrong either wholly or in part; 
<A NAME="864"></A>e.g. suppose some one to have defined 'medicine' as a science of Reality'. 
<A NAME="865"></A>For if medicine be not a science of anything that is real, the definition 
<A NAME="866"></A>is clearly altogether false; while if it be a science of some real thing, 
<A NAME="867"></A>but not of another, it is partly false; for it ought to hold of all reality, 
<A NAME="868"></A>if it is said to be of Reality essentially and not accidentally: as is 
<A NAME="869"></A>the case with other relative terms: for every object of knowledge is a 
<A NAME="870"></A>term relative to knowledge: likewise, also, with other relative terms, 
<A NAME="871"></A>inasmuch as all such are convertible. Moreover, if the right way to render 
<A NAME="872"></A>account of a thing be to render it as it is not in itself but accidentally, 
<A NAME="873"></A>then each and every relative term would be used in relation not to one 
<A NAME="874"></A>thing but to a number of things. For there is no reason why the same thing 
<A NAME="875"></A>should not be both real and white and good, so that it would be a correct 
<A NAME="876"></A>rendering to render the object in relation to any one whatsoever of these, 
<A NAME="877"></A>if to render what it is accidentally be a correct way to render it. It 
<A NAME="878"></A>is, moreover, impossible that a definition of this sort should be peculiar 
<A NAME="879"></A>to the term rendered: for not only but the majority of the other sciences 
<A NAME="880"></A>too, have for their object some real thing, so that each will be a science 
<A NAME="881"></A>of reality. Clearly, then, such a definition does not define any science 
<A NAME="882"></A>at all; for a definition ought to be peculiar to its own term, not 
<A NAME="883"></A>general.
<A NAME="884"></A><BR><BR>Sometimes, again, people define not the thing but only the thing 
<A NAME="885"></A>in a good or perfect condition. Such is the definition of a rhetorician 
<A NAME="886"></A>as 'one who can always see what will persuade in the given circumstances, 
<A NAME="887"></A>and omit nothing'; or of a thief, as 'one who pilfers in secret': for clearly, 
<A NAME="888"></A>if they each do this, then the one will be a good rhetorician, and the 
<A NAME="889"></A>other a good thief: whereas it is not the actual pilfering in secret, but 
<A NAME="890"></A>the wish to do it, that constitutes the thief.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR><BR>Again, see if he has rendered what is desirable for its own sake 
<A NAME="892"></A>as desirable for what it produces or does, or as in any way desirable because 
<A NAME="893"></A>of something else, e.g. by saying that justice is 'what preserves the laws' 
<A NAME="894"></A>or that wisdom is 'what produces happiness'; for what produces or preserves 
<A NAME="895"></A>something else is one of the things desirable for something else. It might 
<A NAME="896"></A>be said that it is possible for what is desirable in itself to be desirable 
<A NAME="897"></A>for something else as well: but still to define what is desirable in itself 
<A NAME="898"></A>in such a way is none the less wrong: for the essence contains par excellence 
<A NAME="899"></A>what is best in anything, and it is better for a thing to be desirable 
<A NAME="900"></A>in itself than to be desirable for something else, so that this is rather 
<A NAME="901"></A>what the definition too ought to have indicated.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="902"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="903"></A><BR><BR>See also whether in defining anything a man has defined it as an 
<A NAME="904"></A>'A and B', or as a 'product of A and B' or as an 'A+B'. If he defines it 
<A NAME="905"></A>as and B', the definition will be true of both and yet of neither of them; 
<A NAME="906"></A>suppose, e.g. justice to be defined as 'temperance and courage.' For if 
<A NAME="907"></A>of two persons each has one of the two only, both and yet neither will 
<A NAME="908"></A>be just: for both together have justice, and yet each singly fails to have 
<A NAME="909"></A>it. Even if the situation here described does not so far appear very absurd 
<A NAME="910"></A>because of the occurrence of this kind of thing in other cases also (for 
<A NAME="911"></A>it is quite possible for two men to have a mina between them, though neither 
<A NAME="912"></A>of them has it by himself), yet least that they should have contrary attributes 
<A NAME="913"></A>surely seems quite absurd; and yet this will follow if the one be temperate 
<A NAME="914"></A>and yet a coward, and the other, though brave, be a profligate; for then 
<A NAME="915"></A>both will exhibit both justice and injustice: for if justice be temperance 
<A NAME="916"></A>and bravery, then injustice will be cowardice and profligacy. In general, 
<A NAME="917"></A>too, all the ways of showing that the whole is not the same as the sum 
<A NAME="918"></A>of its parts are useful in meeting the type just described; for a man who 
<A NAME="919"></A>defines in this way seems to assert that the parts are the same as the 
<A NAME="920"></A>whole. The arguments are particularly appropriate in cases where the process 
<A NAME="921"></A>of putting the parts together is obvious, as in a house and other things 
<A NAME="922"></A>of that sort: for there, clearly, you may have the parts and yet not have 
<A NAME="923"></A>the whole, so that parts and whole cannot be the same.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR><BR>If, however, he has said that the term being defined is not 'A 
<A NAME="925"></A>and B' but the 'product of A and B', look and see in the first place if 
<A NAME="926"></A>A and B cannot in the nature of things have a single product: for some 
<A NAME="927"></A>things are so related to one another that nothing can come of them, e.g. 
<A NAME="928"></A>a line and a number. Moreover, see if the term that has been defined is 
<A NAME="929"></A>in the nature of things found primarily in some single subject, whereas 
<A NAME="930"></A>the things which he has said produce it are not found primarily in any 
<A NAME="931"></A>single subject, but each in a separate one. If so, clearly that term could 
<A NAME="932"></A>not be the product of these things: for the whole is bound to be in the 
<A NAME="933"></A>same things wherein its parts are, so that the whole will then be found 
<A NAME="934"></A>primarily not in one subject only, but in a number of them. If, on the 
<A NAME="935"></A>other hand, both parts and whole are found primarily in some single subject, 
<A NAME="936"></A>see if that medium is not the same, but one thing in the case of the whole 
<A NAME="937"></A>and another in that of the parts. Again, see whether the parts perish together 
<A NAME="938"></A>with the whole: for it ought to happen, vice versa, that the whole perishes 
<A NAME="939"></A>when the parts perish; when the whole perishes, there is no necessity that 
<A NAME="940"></A>the parts should perish too. Or again, see if the whole be good or evil, 
<A NAME="941"></A>and the parts neither, or, vice versa, if the parts be good or evil and 
<A NAME="942"></A>the whole neither. For it is impossible either for a neutral thing to produce 
<A NAME="943"></A>something good or bad, or for things good or bad to produce a neutral thing. 
<A NAME="944"></A>Or again, see if the one thing is more distinctly good than the other is 
<A NAME="945"></A>evil, and yet the product be no more good than evil, e.g. suppose shamelessness 
<A NAME="946"></A>be defined as 'the product of courage and false opinion': here the goodness 
<A NAME="947"></A>of courage exceeds the evil of false opinion; accordingly the product of 
<A NAME="948"></A>these ought to have corresponded to this excess, and to be either good 
<A NAME="949"></A>without qualification, or at least more good than evil. Or it may be that 
<A NAME="950"></A>this does not necessarily follow, unless each be in itself good or bad; 
<A NAME="951"></A>for many things that are productive are not good in themselves, but only 
<A NAME="952"></A>in combination; or, per contra, they are good taken singly, and bad or 
<A NAME="953"></A>neutral in combination. What has just been said is most clearly illustrated 
<A NAME="954"></A>in the case of things that make for health or sickness; for some drugs 
<A NAME="955"></A>are such that each taken alone is good, but if they are both administered 
<A NAME="956"></A>in a mixture, bad.
<A NAME="957"></A><BR><BR>Again, see whether the whole, as produced from a better and worse, 
<A NAME="958"></A>fails to be worse than the better and better than the worse element. This 
<A NAME="959"></A>again, however, need not necessarily be the case, unless the elements compounded 
<A NAME="960"></A>be in themselves good; if they are not, the whole may very well not be 
<A NAME="961"></A>good, as in the cases just instanced.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see if the whole be synonymous with one of the elements: 
<A NAME="963"></A>for it ought not to be, any more than in the case of syllables: for the 
<A NAME="964"></A>syllable is not synonymous with any of the letters of which it is made 
<A NAME="965"></A>up.
<A NAME="966"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, see if he has failed to state the manner of their composition: 
<A NAME="967"></A>for the mere mention of its elements is not enough to make the thing intelligible. 
<A NAME="968"></A>For the essence of any compound thing is not merely that it is a product 
<A NAME="969"></A>of so-and-so, but that it is a product of them compounded in such and such 
<A NAME="970"></A>a way, just as in the case of a house: for here the materials do not make 
<A NAME="971"></A>a house irrespective of the way they are put together.
<A NAME="972"></A><BR><BR>If a man has defined an object as 'A+B', the first thing to be 
<A NAME="973"></A>said is that 'A+B' means the same either as 'A and B', or as the 'product 
<A NAME="974"></A>of A and B.' for 'honey+water' means either the honey and the water, or 
<A NAME="975"></A>the 'drink made of honey and water'. If, then, he admits that 'A+B' is 
<A NAME="976"></A>+ B' is the same as either of these two things, the same criticisms will 
<A NAME="977"></A>apply as have already been given for meeting each of them. Moreover, distinguish 
<A NAME="978"></A>between the different senses in which one thing may be said to be '+' another, 
<A NAME="979"></A>and see if there is none of them in which A could be said to exist '+ B.' 
<A NAME="980"></A>Thus e.g. supposing the expression to mean that they exist either in some 
<A NAME="981"></A>identical thing capable of containing them (as e.g. justice and courage 
<A NAME="982"></A>are found in the soul), or else in the same place or in the same time, 
<A NAME="983"></A>and if this be in no way true of the A and B in question, clearly the definition 
<A NAME="984"></A>rendered could not hold of anything, as there is no possible way in which 
<A NAME="985"></A>A can exist B'. If, however, among the various senses above distinguished, 
<A NAME="986"></A>it be true that A and B are each found in the same time as the other, look 
<A NAME="987"></A>and see if possibly the two are not used in the same relation. Thus e.g. 
<A NAME="988"></A>suppose courage to have been defined as 'daring with right reasoning': 
<A NAME="989"></A>here it is possible that the person exhibits daring in robbery, and right 
<A NAME="990"></A>reasoning in regard to the means of health: but he may have 'the former 
<A NAME="991"></A>quality+the latter' at the same time, and not as yet be courageous! Moreover, 
<A NAME="992"></A>even though both be used in the same relation as well, e.g. in relation 
<A NAME="993"></A>to medical treatment (for a man may exhibit both daring and right reasoning 
<A NAME="994"></A>in respect of medical treatment), still, none the less, not even this combination 
<A NAME="995"></A>of 'the one+the other 'makes him 'courageous'. For the two must not relate 
<A NAME="996"></A>to any casual object that is the same, any more than each to a different 
<A NAME="997"></A>object; rather, they must relate to the function of courage, e.g. meeting 
<A NAME="998"></A>the perils of war, or whatever is more properly speaking its function than 
<A NAME="999"></A>this.
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR><BR>Some definitions rendered in this form fail to come under the aforesaid 
<A NAME="1001"></A>division at all, e.g. a definition of anger as 'pain with a consciousness 
<A NAME="1002"></A>of being slighted'. For what this means to say is that it is because of 
<A NAME="1003"></A>a consciousness of this sort that the pain occurs; but to occur 'because 
<A NAME="1004"></A>of' a thing is not the same as to occur '+ a thing' in any of its aforesaid 
<A NAME="1005"></A>senses.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1006"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="1007"></A><BR><BR>Again, if he have described the whole compounded as the 'composition' 
<A NAME="1008"></A>of these things (e.g. 'a living creature' as a 'composition of soul and 
<A NAME="1009"></A>body'), first of all see whether he has omitted to state the kind of composition, 
<A NAME="1010"></A>as (e.g.) in a definition of 'flesh' or 'bone' as the 'composition of fire, 
<A NAME="1011"></A>earth, and air'. For it is not enough to say it is a composition, but you 
<A NAME="1012"></A>should also go on to define the kind of composition: for these things do 
<A NAME="1013"></A>not form flesh irrespective of the manner of their composition, but when 
<A NAME="1014"></A>compounded in one way they form flesh, when in another, bone. It appears, 
<A NAME="1015"></A>moreover, that neither of the aforesaid substances is the same as a 'composition' 
<A NAME="1016"></A>at all: for a composition always has a decomposition as its contrary, whereas 
<A NAME="1017"></A>neither of the aforesaid has any contrary. Moreover, if it is equally probable 
<A NAME="1018"></A>that every compound is a composition or else that none is, and every kind 
<A NAME="1019"></A>of living creature, though a compound, is never a composition, then no 
<A NAME="1020"></A>other compound could be a composition either.
<A NAME="1021"></A><BR><BR>Again, if in the nature of a thing two contraries are equally liable 
<A NAME="1022"></A>to occur, and the thing has been defined through the one, clearly it has 
<A NAME="1023"></A>not been defined; else there will be more than one definition of the same 
<A NAME="1024"></A>thing; for how is it any more a definition to define it through this one 
<A NAME="1025"></A>than through the other, seeing that both alike are naturally liable to 
<A NAME="1026"></A>occur in it? Such is the definition of the soul, if defined as a substance 
<A NAME="1027"></A>capable of receiving knowledge: for it has a like capacity for receiving 
<A NAME="1028"></A>ignorance.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR>Also, even when one cannot attack the definition as a whole for 
<A NAME="1030"></A>lack of acquaintance with the whole, one should attack some part of it, 
<A NAME="1031"></A>if one knows that part and sees it to be incorrectly rendered: for if the 
<A NAME="1032"></A>part be demolished, so too is the whole definition. Where, again, a definition 
<A NAME="1033"></A>is obscure, one should first of all correct and reshape it in order to 
<A NAME="1034"></A>make some part of it clear and get a handle for attack, and then proceed 
<A NAME="1035"></A>to examine it. For the answerer is bound either to accept the sense as 
<A NAME="1036"></A>taken by the questioner, or else himself to explain clearly whatever it 
<A NAME="1037"></A>is that his definition means. Moreover, just as in the assemblies the ordinary 
<A NAME="1038"></A>practice is to move an emendation of the existing law and, if the emendation 
<A NAME="1039"></A>is better, they repeal the existing law, so one ought to do in the case 
<A NAME="1040"></A>of definitions as well: one ought oneself to propose a second definition: 
<A NAME="1041"></A>for if it is seen to be better, and more indicative of the object defined, 
<A NAME="1042"></A>clearly the definition already laid down will have been demolished, on 
<A NAME="1043"></A>the principle that there cannot be more than one definition of the same 
<A NAME="1044"></A>thing.
<A NAME="1045"></A><BR><BR>In combating definitions it is always one of the chief elementary 
<A NAME="1046"></A>principles to take by oneself a happy shot at a definition of the object 
<A NAME="1047"></A>before one, or to adopt some correctly expressed definition. For one is 
<A NAME="1048"></A>bound, with the model (as it were) before one's eyes, to discern both any 
<A NAME="1049"></A>shortcoming in any features that the definition ought to have, and also 
<A NAME="1050"></A>any superfluous addition, so that one is better supplied with lines of 
<A NAME="1051"></A>attack.
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR><BR>As to definitions, then, let so much suffice.
