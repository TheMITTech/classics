<BR><A NAME="start"></A>

<BR><BR>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>

<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>We have now to consider the parts which are useful to animals for movement 
<A NAME="12"></A>in place (locomotion); first, why each part is such as it is and to what 
<A NAME="13"></A>end they possess them; and second, the differences between these parts 
<A NAME="14"></A>both in one and the same creature, and again by comparison of the parts 
<A NAME="15"></A>of creatures of different species with one another. First then let us lay 
<A NAME="16"></A>down how many questions we have to consider.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>The first is what are the fewest points of motion necessary to 
<A NAME="18"></A>animal progression, the second why sanguineous animals have four points 
<A NAME="19"></A>and not more, but bloodless animals more than four, and generally why some 
<A NAME="20"></A>animals are footless, others bipeds, others quadrupeds, others polypods, 
<A NAME="21"></A>and why all have an even number of feet, if they have feet at all; why 
<A NAME="22"></A>in fine the points on which progression depends are even in 
<A NAME="23"></A>number.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>Next, why are man and bird bipeds, but fish footless; and why do 
<A NAME="25"></A>man and bird, though both bipeds, have an opposite curvature of the legs. 
<A NAME="26"></A>For man bends his legs convexly, a bird has his bent concavely; again, 
<A NAME="27"></A>man bends his arms and legs in opposite directions, for he has his arms 
<A NAME="28"></A>bent convexly, but his legs concavely. And a viviparous quadruped bends 
<A NAME="29"></A>his limbs in opposite directions to a man's, and in opposite directions 
<A NAME="30"></A>to one another; for he has his forelegs bent convexly, his hind legs concavely. 
<A NAME="31"></A>Again, quadrupeds which are not viviparous but oviparous have a peculiar 
<A NAME="32"></A>curvature of the limbs laterally away from the body. Again, why do quadrupeds 
<A NAME="33"></A>move their legs criss-cross?
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>We have to examine the reasons for all these facts, and others 
<A NAME="35"></A>cognate to them; that the facts are such is clear from our Natural History, 
<A NAME="36"></A>we have now to ask reasons for the facts.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="37"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>At the beginning of the inquiry we must postulate the principles 
<A NAME="39"></A>we are accustomed constantly to use for our scientific investigation of 
<A NAME="40"></A>nature, that is we must take for granted principles of this universal character 
<A NAME="41"></A>which appear in all Nature's work. Of these one is that Nature creates 
<A NAME="42"></A>nothing without a purpose, but always the best possible in each kind of 
<A NAME="43"></A>living creature by reference to its essential constitution. Accordingly 
<A NAME="44"></A>if one way is better than another that is the way of Nature. Next we must 
<A NAME="45"></A>take for granted the different species of dimensions which inhere in various 
<A NAME="46"></A>things; of these there are three pairs of two each, superior and inferior, 
<A NAME="47"></A>before and behind, to the right and to the left. Further we must assume 
<A NAME="48"></A>that the originals of movements in place are thrusts and pulls. (These 
<A NAME="49"></A>are the essential place-movements, it is only accidentally that what is 
<A NAME="50"></A>carried by another is moved; it is not thought to move itself, but to be 
<A NAME="51"></A>moved by something else.)
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="52"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>After these preliminaries, we go on to the next questions in 
<A NAME="54"></A>order.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR>Now of animals which change their position some move with the whole 
<A NAME="56"></A>body at once, for example jumping animals, others move one part first and 
<A NAME="57"></A>then the other, for example walking (and running) animals. In both these 
<A NAME="58"></A>changes the moving creature always changes its position by pressing against 
<A NAME="59"></A>what lies below it. Accordingly if what is below gives way too quickly 
<A NAME="60"></A>for that which is moving upon it to lean against it, or if it affords no 
<A NAME="61"></A>resistance at all to what is moving, the latter can of itself effect no 
<A NAME="62"></A>movement upon it. For an animal which jumps makes its jump both by leaning 
<A NAME="63"></A>against its own upper part and also against what is beneath its feet; for 
<A NAME="64"></A>at the joints the parts do in a sense lean upon one another, and in general 
<A NAME="65"></A>that which pushes down leans upon what is pushed down. That is why athletes 
<A NAME="66"></A>jump further with weights in their hands than without, and runners run 
<A NAME="67"></A>faster if they swing their arms; there is in extending the arms a kind 
<A NAME="68"></A>of leaning against the hands and wrists. In all cases then that which moves 
<A NAME="69"></A>makes its change of position by the use of at least two parts of the body; 
<A NAME="70"></A>one part so to speak squeezes, the other is squeezed; for the part that 
<A NAME="71"></A>is still is squeezed as it has to carry the weight, the part that is lifted 
<A NAME="72"></A>strains against that which carries the weight. It follows then that nothing 
<A NAME="73"></A>without parts can move itself in this way, for it has not in it the distinction 
<A NAME="74"></A>of the part which is passive and that which is active.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="75"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>Again, the boundaries by which living beings are naturally determined 
<A NAME="77"></A>are six in number, superior and inferior, before and behind, right and 
<A NAME="78"></A>left. Of these all living beings have a superior and an inferior part; 
<A NAME="79"></A>for superior and inferior is in plants too, not only in animals. And this 
<A NAME="80"></A>distinction is one of function, not merely of position relatively to our 
<A NAME="81"></A>earth and the sky above our heads. The superior is that from which flows 
<A NAME="82"></A>in each kind the distribution of nutriment and the process of growth; the 
<A NAME="83"></A>inferior is that to which the process flows and in which it ends. One is 
<A NAME="84"></A>a starting-point, the other an end, and the starting-point is the superior. 
<A NAME="85"></A>And yet it might be thought that in the case of plants at least the inferior 
<A NAME="86"></A>is rather the appropriate starting-point, for in them the superior and 
<A NAME="87"></A>inferior are in position other than in animals. Still they are similarly 
<A NAME="88"></A>situated from the point of view of function, though not in their position 
<A NAME="89"></A>relatively to the universe. The roots are the superior part of a plant, 
<A NAME="90"></A>for from them the nutriment is distributed to the growing members, and 
<A NAME="91"></A>a plant takes it with its roots as an animal does with its 
<A NAME="92"></A>mouth.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>Things that are not only alive but are animals have both a front 
<A NAME="94"></A>and a back, because they all have sense, and front and back are distinguished 
<A NAME="95"></A>by reference to sense. The front is the part in which sense is innate, 
<A NAME="96"></A>and whence each thing gets its sensations, the opposite parts are the 
<A NAME="97"></A>back.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>All animals which partake not only in sense, but are able of themselves 
<A NAME="99"></A>to make a change of place, have a further distinction of left and right 
<A NAME="100"></A>besides those already enumerated; like the former these are distinctions 
<A NAME="101"></A>of function and not of position. The right is that from which change of 
<A NAME="102"></A>position naturally begins, the opposite which naturally depends upon this 
<A NAME="103"></A>is the left.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>This distinction (of right and left) is more articulate and detailed 
<A NAME="105"></A>in some than in others. For animals which make the aforesaid change (of 
<A NAME="106"></A>place) by the help of organized parts (I mean feet for example, or wings 
<A NAME="107"></A>or similar organs) have the left and right distinguished in greater detail, 
<A NAME="108"></A>while those which are not differentiated into such parts, but make the 
<A NAME="109"></A>differentiation in the body itself and so progress, like some footless 
<A NAME="110"></A>animals (for example snakes and caterpillars after their kind, and besides 
<A NAME="111"></A>what men call earth-worms), all these have the distinction spoken of, although 
<A NAME="112"></A>it is not made so manifest to us. That the beginning of movement is on 
<A NAME="113"></A>the right is indicated by the fact that all men carry burdens on the left 
<A NAME="114"></A>shoulder; in this way they set free the side which initiates movement and 
<A NAME="115"></A>enable the side which bears the weight to be moved. And so men hop easier 
<A NAME="116"></A>on the left leg; for the nature of the right is to initiate movement, that 
<A NAME="117"></A>of the left to be moved. The burden then must rest on the side which is 
<A NAME="118"></A>to be moved, not on that which is going to cause movement, and if it be 
<A NAME="119"></A>set on the moving side, which is the original of movement, it will either 
<A NAME="120"></A>not be moved at all or with more labour. Another indication that the right 
<A NAME="121"></A>is the source of movement is the way we put our feet forward; all men lead 
<A NAME="122"></A>off with the left, and after standing still prefer to put the left foot 
<A NAME="123"></A>forward, unless something happens to prevent it. The reason is that their 
<A NAME="124"></A>movement comes from the leg they step off, not from the one put forward. 
<A NAME="125"></A>Again, men guard themselves with their right. And this is the reason why 
<A NAME="126"></A>the right is the same in all, for that from which motion begins is the 
<A NAME="127"></A>same for all, and has its natural position in the same place, and for this 
<A NAME="128"></A>reason the spiral-shaped Testaceans have their shells on the right, for 
<A NAME="129"></A>they do not move in the direction of the spire, but all go forward in the 
<A NAME="130"></A>direction opposite to the spire. Examples are the murex and the ceryx. 
<A NAME="131"></A>As all animals then start movement from the right, and the right moves 
<A NAME="132"></A>in the same direction as the whole, it is necessary for all to be alike 
<A NAME="133"></A>right-handed. And man has the left limbs detached more than any other animal 
<A NAME="134"></A>because he is natural in a higher degree than the other animals; now the 
<A NAME="135"></A>right is naturally both better than the left and separate from it, and 
<A NAME="136"></A>so in man the right is more especially the right, more dextrous that is, 
<A NAME="137"></A>than in other animals. The right then being differentiated it is only reasonable 
<A NAME="138"></A>that in man the left should be most movable, and most detached. In man, 
<A NAME="139"></A>too, the other starting-points are found most naturally and clearly distinct, 
<A NAME="140"></A>the superior part that is and the front.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="141"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>Animals which, like men and birds, have the superior part distinguished 
<A NAME="143"></A>from the front are two-footed (biped). In them, of the four points of motion, 
<A NAME="144"></A>two are wings in the one, hands and arms in the other. Animals which have 
<A NAME="145"></A>the superior and the front parts identically situated are four-footed, 
<A NAME="146"></A>many-footed, or footless (quadruped, polypod, limbless). I use the term 
<A NAME="147"></A>foot for a member employed for movement in place connected with a point 
<A NAME="148"></A>on the ground, for the feet appear to have got their name from the ground 
<A NAME="149"></A>under our feet.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>Some animals, too, have the front and back parts identically situated, 
<A NAME="151"></A>for example, Cephalopods (molluscs) and spiral-shaped Testaceans, and these 
<A NAME="152"></A>we have discussed elsewhere in another connexion.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>Now there is in place a superior, an intermediate, and an inferior; 
<A NAME="154"></A>in respect to place bipeds have their superior part corresponding to the 
<A NAME="155"></A>part of the universe; quadrupeds, polypods, and footless animals to the 
<A NAME="156"></A>intermediate part, and plants to the inferior. The reason is that these 
<A NAME="157"></A>have no power of locomotion, and the superior part is determined relatively 
<A NAME="158"></A>to the nutriment, and their nutriment is from the earth. Quadrupeds, polypods, 
<A NAME="159"></A>and footless animals again have their superior part corresponding to the 
<A NAME="160"></A>intermediate, because they are not erect. Bipeds have theirs corresponding 
<A NAME="161"></A>to the superior part of the universe because they are erect, and of bipeds, 
<A NAME="162"></A>man par excellence; for man is the most natural of bipeds. And it is reasonable 
<A NAME="163"></A>for the starting points to be in these parts; for the starting-point is 
<A NAME="164"></A>honourable, and the superior is more honourable than the inferior, the 
<A NAME="165"></A>front than the back, and the right than the left. Or we may reverse the 
<A NAME="166"></A>argument and say quite well that these parts are more honourable than their 
<A NAME="167"></A>opposites just because the starting-points are in them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="168"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>The above discussion has made it clear that the original of movement 
<A NAME="170"></A>is in the parts on the right. Now every continuous whole, one part of which 
<A NAME="171"></A>is moved while the other remains at rest must, in order to be able to move 
<A NAME="172"></A>as a whole while one part stands still, have in the place where both parts 
<A NAME="173"></A>have opposed movements some common part which connects the moving parts 
<A NAME="174"></A>with one another. Further in this common part the original of the motion 
<A NAME="175"></A>(and similarly of the absence of motion) of each of the parts must 
<A NAME="176"></A>lie.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>Clearly then if any of the opposite pairs of parts (right and left, 
<A NAME="178"></A>that is, superior and inferior, before and behind) have a movement of their 
<A NAME="179"></A>own, each of them has for common original of its movements the juncture 
<A NAME="180"></A>of the parts in question.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>Now before and behind are not distinctions relatively to that which 
<A NAME="182"></A>sets up its own motion, because in nature nothing has a movement backwards, 
<A NAME="183"></A>nor has a moving animal any division whereby it may make a change of position 
<A NAME="184"></A>towards its front or back; but right and left, superior and inferior are 
<A NAME="185"></A>so distinguished. Accordingly, all animals which progress by the use of 
<A NAME="186"></A>distinct members have these members distinguished not by the differences 
<A NAME="187"></A>of before and behind, but only of the remaining two pairs; the prior difference 
<A NAME="188"></A>dividing these members into right and left (a difference which must appear 
<A NAME="189"></A>as soon as you have division into two), and the other difference appearing 
<A NAME="190"></A>of necessity where there is division into four.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>Since then these two pairs, the superior and inferior and the right 
<A NAME="192"></A>and left, are linked to one another by the same common original (by which 
<A NAME="193"></A>I mean that which controls their movement), and further, everything which 
<A NAME="194"></A>is intended to make a movement in each such part properly must have the 
<A NAME="195"></A>original cause of all the said movements arranged in a certain definite 
<A NAME="196"></A>position relatively to the distances from it of the originals of the movements 
<A NAME="197"></A>of the individual members (and these centres of the individual parts are 
<A NAME="198"></A>in pairs arranged coordinately or diagonally, and the common centre is 
<A NAME="199"></A>the original from which the animal's movements of right and left, and similarly 
<A NAME="200"></A>of superior and inferior, start); each animal must have this original at 
<A NAME="201"></A>a point where it is equally or nearly equally related to each of the centres 
<A NAME="202"></A>in the four parts described.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="203"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then how locomotion belongs to those animals only which 
<A NAME="205"></A>make their changes of place by means of two or four points in their structure, 
<A NAME="206"></A>or to such animals par excellence. Moreover, since this property belongs 
<A NAME="207"></A>almost peculiarly to Sanguineous animals, we see that no Sanguineous animal 
<A NAME="208"></A>can progress at more points than four, and that if it is the nature of 
<A NAME="209"></A>anything so to progress at four points it must of necessity be 
<A NAME="210"></A>Sanguineous.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>What we observe in the animal world is in agreement with the above 
<A NAME="212"></A>account. For no Sanguineous animal if it be divided into more parts can 
<A NAME="213"></A>live for any appreciable length of time, nor can it enjoy the power of 
<A NAME="214"></A>locomotion which it possessed while it was a continuous and undivided whole. 
<A NAME="215"></A>But some bloodless animals and polypods can live a long time, if divided, 
<A NAME="216"></A>in each of the severed parts, and can move in the same way as before they 
<A NAME="217"></A>were dismembered. Examples are what is termed the centipede and other insects 
<A NAME="218"></A>that are long in shape, for even the hinder portion of all these goes on 
<A NAME="219"></A>progressing in the same direction as before when they are cut in 
<A NAME="220"></A>two.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>The explanation of their living when thus divided is that each 
<A NAME="222"></A>of them is constructed like a continuous body of many separate living beings. 
<A NAME="223"></A>It is plain, too, from what was said above why they are like this. Animals 
<A NAME="224"></A>constructed most naturally are made to move at two or four points, and 
<A NAME="225"></A>even limbless Sanguinea are no exception. They too move by dint of four 
<A NAME="226"></A>points, whereby they achieve progression. They go forward by means of two 
<A NAME="227"></A>flexions. For in each of their flexions there is a right and a left, both 
<A NAME="228"></A>before and behind in their flat surface, in the part towards the head a 
<A NAME="229"></A>right and a left front point, and in the part towards the tail the two 
<A NAME="230"></A>hinder points. They look as if they moved at two points only, where they 
<A NAME="231"></A>touch before and behind, but that is only because they are narrow in breadth. 
<A NAME="232"></A>Even. in them the right is the sovereign part, and there is an alternate 
<A NAME="233"></A>correspondence behind, exactly as in quadrupeds. The reason of their flexions 
<A NAME="234"></A>is their great length, for just as tall men walk with their spines bellied 
<A NAME="235"></A>(undulated) forward, and when their right shoulder is leading in a forward 
<A NAME="236"></A>direction their left hip rather inclined backwards, so that their middle 
<A NAME="237"></A>becomes hollow and bellied (undulated), so we ought to conceive snakes 
<A NAME="238"></A>as moving in concave curves (undulations) upon the ground. And this is 
<A NAME="239"></A>evidence that they move themselves like the quadrupeds, for they make the 
<A NAME="240"></A>concave in its turn convex and the convex concave. When in its turn the 
<A NAME="241"></A>left of the forward parts is leading, the concavity is in its turn reversed, 
<A NAME="242"></A>for the right becomes the inner. (Let the right front point be A, the left 
<A NAME="243"></A>B, the right hind C, the left D.)
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>Among land animals this is the character of the movement of snakes, 
<A NAME="245"></A>and among water animals of eels, and conger-eels and also lampreys, in 
<A NAME="246"></A>fact of all that have their form snakelike. However, some marine animals 
<A NAME="247"></A>of this shape have no fin, lampreys for example, but put the sea to the 
<A NAME="248"></A>same use as snakes do both land and water (for snakes swim precisely as 
<A NAME="249"></A>they move on the ground). Others have two fins only, for example conger-eels 
<A NAME="250"></A>and eels and a kind of cestreus which breeds in the lake of Siphae. On 
<A NAME="251"></A>this account too those that are accustomed to live on land, for example 
<A NAME="252"></A>all the eels, move with fewer flexions in a fluid than on land, while the 
<A NAME="253"></A>kind of cestreus which has two fins, by its flexion in a fluid makes up 
<A NAME="254"></A>the remaining points.

<A NAME="255"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>The reason why snakes are limbless is first that nature makes nothing 
<A NAME="257"></A>without purpose, but always regards what is the best possible for each 
<A NAME="258"></A>individual, preserving the peculiar essence of each and its intended character, 
<A NAME="259"></A>and secondly the principle we laid down above that no Sanguineous creature 
<A NAME="260"></A>can move itself at more than four points. Granting this it is evident that 
<A NAME="261"></A>Sanguineous animals like snakes, whose length is out of proportion to the 
<A NAME="262"></A>rest of their dimensions, cannot possibly have limbs; for they cannot have 
<A NAME="263"></A>more than four (or they would be bloodless), and if they had two or four 
<A NAME="264"></A>they would be practically stationary; so slow and unprofitable would their 
<A NAME="265"></A>movement necessarily be.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>But every limbed animal has necessarily an even number of such 
<A NAME="267"></A>limbs. For those which only jump and so move from place to place do not 
<A NAME="268"></A>need limbs for this movement at least, but those which not only jump but 
<A NAME="269"></A>also need to walk, finding that movement not sufficient for their purposes, 
<A NAME="270"></A>evidently either are better able to progress with even limbs or cannot 
<A NAME="271"></A>otherwise progress at all every animal which has limbs must have an even 
<A NAME="272"></A>us for as this kind of movement is effected by part of the body at a time, 
<A NAME="273"></A>and not by the whole at once as in the movement of leaping, some of the 
<A NAME="274"></A>limbs must in turn remain at rest, and others be moved, and the animal 
<A NAME="275"></A>must act in each of these cases with opposite limbs, shifting the weight 
<A NAME="276"></A>from the limbs that are being moved to those at rest. And so nothing can 
<A NAME="277"></A>walk on three limbs or on one; in the latter case it has no support at 
<A NAME="278"></A>all on which to rest the body's weight, in the former only in respect of 
<A NAME="279"></A>one pair of opposites, and so it must necessarily fall in endeavouring 
<A NAME="280"></A>so to move.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>Polypods however, like the Centipede, can indeed make progress 
<A NAME="282"></A>on an odd number of limbs, as may be seen by the experiment of wounding 
<A NAME="283"></A>one of their limbs; for then the mutilation of one row of limbs is corrected 
<A NAME="284"></A>by the number of limbs which remain on either side. Such mutilated creatures, 
<A NAME="285"></A>however, drag the wounded limb after them with the remainder, and do not 
<A NAME="286"></A>properly speaking walk. Moreover, it is plain that they, too, would make 
<A NAME="287"></A>the change of place better if they had an even number, in fact if none 
<A NAME="288"></A>were missing and they had the limbs which correspond to one another. In 
<A NAME="289"></A>this way they could equalize their own weight, and not oscillate to one 
<A NAME="290"></A>side, if they had corresponding supports instead of one section of the 
<A NAME="291"></A>opposite sides being unoccupied by a limb. A walking creature advances 
<A NAME="292"></A>from each of its members alternately, for in this way it recovers the same 
<A NAME="293"></A>figure that it had at first.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="294"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>The fact that all animals have an even number of feet, and the 
<A NAME="296"></A>reasons for the fact have been set forth. What follows will explain that 
<A NAME="297"></A>if there were no point at rest flexion and straightening would be impossible. 
<A NAME="298"></A>Flexion is a change from a right line to an arc or an angle, straightening 
<A NAME="299"></A>a change from either of these to a right line. Now in all such changes 
<A NAME="300"></A>the flexion or the straightening must be relative to one point. Moreover, 
<A NAME="301"></A>without flexion there could not be walking or swimming or flying. For since 
<A NAME="302"></A>limbed creatures stand and take their weight alternately on one or other 
<A NAME="303"></A>of the opposite legs, if one be thrust forward the other of necessity must 
<A NAME="304"></A>be bent. For the opposite limbs are naturally of equal length, and the 
<A NAME="305"></A>one which is under the weight must be a kind of perpendicular at right 
<A NAME="306"></A>angles to the ground.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>When then one leg is advanced it becomes the hypotenuse of a right-angled 
<A NAME="308"></A>triangle. Its square then is equal to the square on the other side together 
<A NAME="309"></A>with the square on the base. As the legs then are equal, the one at rest 
<A NAME="310"></A>must bend either at the knee or, if there were any kneeless animal which 
<A NAME="311"></A>walked, at some other articulation. The following experiment exhibits the 
<A NAME="312"></A>fact. If a man were to walk parallel to a wall in sunshine, the line described 
<A NAME="313"></A>(by the shadow of his head&gt; would be not straight but zigzag, becoming 
<A NAME="314"></A>lower as he bends, and higher when he stands and lifts himself 
<A NAME="315"></A>up.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>It is, indeed, possible to move oneself even if the leg be not 
<A NAME="317"></A>bent, in the way in which children crawl. This was the old though erroneous 
<A NAME="318"></A>account of the movement of elephants. But these kinds of movements involve 
<A NAME="319"></A>a flexion in the shoulders or in the hips. Nothing at any rate could walk 
<A NAME="320"></A>upright continuously and securely without flexions at the knee, but would 
<A NAME="321"></A>have to move like men in the wrestling schools who crawl forward through 
<A NAME="322"></A>the sand on their knees. For the upper part of the upright creature is 
<A NAME="323"></A>long so that its leg has to be correspondingly long; in consequence there 
<A NAME="324"></A>must be flexion. For since a stationary position is perpendicular, if that 
<A NAME="325"></A>which moves cannot bend it will either fall forward as the right angle 
<A NAME="326"></A>becomes acute or will not be able to progress. For if one leg is at right 
<A NAME="327"></A>angles to the ground and the other is advanced, the latter will be at once 
<A NAME="328"></A>equal and greater. For it will be equal to the stationary leg and also 
<A NAME="329"></A>equivalent to the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle. That which goes 
<A NAME="330"></A>forward therefore must bend, and while bending one, extend the other leg 
<A NAME="331"></A>simultaneously, so as to incline forward and make a stride and still remain 
<A NAME="332"></A>above the perpendicular; for the legs form an isosceles triangle, and the 
<A NAME="333"></A>head sinks lower when it is perpendicularly above the base on which it 
<A NAME="334"></A>stands.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>Of limbless animals, some progress by undulations (and this happens 
<A NAME="336"></A>in two ways, either they undulate on the ground, like snakes, or up and 
<A NAME="337"></A>down, like caterpillars), and undulation is a flexion; others by a telescopic 
<A NAME="338"></A>action, like what are called earthworms and leeches. These go forward, 
<A NAME="339"></A>first one part leading and then drawing the whole of the rest of the body 
<A NAME="340"></A>up to this, and so they change from place to place. It is plain too that 
<A NAME="341"></A>if the two curves were not greater than the one line which subtends them 
<A NAME="342"></A>undulating animals could not move themselves; when the flexure is extended 
<A NAME="343"></A>they would not have moved forward at all if the flexure or arc were equal 
<A NAME="344"></A>to the chord subtended; as it is, it reaches further when it is straightened 
<A NAME="345"></A>out, and then this part stays still and it draws up what is left 
<A NAME="346"></A>behind.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>In all the changes described that which moves now extends itself 
<A NAME="348"></A>in a straight line to progress, and now is hooped; it straightens itself 
<A NAME="349"></A>in its leading part, and is hooped in what follows behind. Even jumping 
<A NAME="350"></A>animals all make a flexion in the part of the body which is underneath, 
<A NAME="351"></A>and after this fashion make their leaps. So too flying and swimming things 
<A NAME="352"></A>progress, the one straightening and bending their wings to fly, the other 
<A NAME="353"></A>their fins to swim. Of the latter some have four fins, others which are 
<A NAME="354"></A>rather long, for example eels, have only two. These swim by substituting 
<A NAME="355"></A>a flexion of the rest of their body for the (missing) pair of fins to complete 
<A NAME="356"></A>the movement, as we have said before. Flat fish use two fins, and the flat 
<A NAME="357"></A>of their body as a substitute for the absent pair of fins. Quite flat fish, 
<A NAME="358"></A>like the Ray, produce their swimming movement with the actual fins and 
<A NAME="359"></A>with the two extremes or semicircles of their body, bending and straightening 
<A NAME="360"></A>themselves alternately.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="361"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>A difficulty might perhaps be raised about birds. How, it may be 
<A NAME="363"></A>said, can they, either when they fly or when they walk, be said to move 
<A NAME="364"></A>at four points? Now we did not say that all Sanguinea move at four points, 
<A NAME="365"></A>but merely at not more than four. Moreover, they cannot as a fact fly if 
<A NAME="366"></A>their legs be removed, nor walk without their wings. Even a man does not 
<A NAME="367"></A>walk without moving his shoulders. Everything indeed, as we have said, 
<A NAME="368"></A>makes a change of place by flexion and straightening, for all things progress 
<A NAME="369"></A>by pressing upon what being beneath them up to a point gives way as it 
<A NAME="370"></A>were gradually; accordingly, even if there be no flexion in another member, 
<A NAME="371"></A>there must be at least in the point whence motion begins, is in feathered 
<A NAME="372"></A>(flying) insects at the base of the 'scale-wing', in birds at the base 
<A NAME="373"></A>of the wing, in others at the base of the corresponding member, the fins, 
<A NAME="374"></A>for instance, in fish. In others, for example snakes, the flexion begins 
<A NAME="375"></A>in the joints of the body.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>In winged creatures the tail serves, like a ship's rudder, to keep 
<A NAME="377"></A>the flying thing in its course. The tail then must like other limbs be 
<A NAME="378"></A>able to bend at the point of attachment. And so flying insects, and birds 
<A NAME="379"></A>(Schizoptera) whose tails are ill-adapted for the use in question, for 
<A NAME="380"></A>example peacocks, and domestic cocks, and generally birds that hardly fly, 
<A NAME="381"></A>cannot steer a straight course. Flying insects have absolutely no tail, 
<A NAME="382"></A>and so drift along like a rudderless vessel, and beat against anything 
<A NAME="383"></A>they happen upon; and this applies equally to sharded insects, like the 
<A NAME="384"></A>scarab-beetle and the chafer, and to unsharded, like bees and wasps. Further, 
<A NAME="385"></A>birds that are not made for flight have a tail that is of no use; for instance 
<A NAME="386"></A>the purple coot and the heron and all water-fowl. These fly stretching 
<A NAME="387"></A>out their feet as a substitute for a tail, and use their legs instead of 
<A NAME="388"></A>a tail to direct their flight. The flight of insects is slow and frail 
<A NAME="389"></A>because the character of their feathery wings is not proportionate to the 
<A NAME="390"></A>bulk of their body; this is heavy, their wings small and frail, and so 
<A NAME="391"></A>the flight they use is like a cargo boat attempting to make its voyage 
<A NAME="392"></A>with oars; now the frailty both of the actual wings and of the outgrowths 
<A NAME="393"></A>upon them contributes in a measure to the flight described. Among birds, 
<A NAME="394"></A>the peacock's tail is at one time useless because of its size, at another 
<A NAME="395"></A>because it is shed. But birds are in general at the opposite pole to flying 
<A NAME="396"></A>insects as regards their feathers, but especially the swiftest flyers among 
<A NAME="397"></A>them. (These are the birds with curved talons, for swiftness of wing is 
<A NAME="398"></A>useful to their mode of life.) The rest of their bodily structure is in 
<A NAME="399"></A>harmony with their peculiar movement, the small head, the slight neck, 
<A NAME="400"></A>the strong and acute breastbone (acute like the prow of a clipper-built 
<A NAME="401"></A>vessel, so as to be well-girt, and strong by dint of its mass of flesh), 
<A NAME="402"></A>in order to be able to push away the air that beats against it, and that 
<A NAME="403"></A>easily and without exhaustion. The hind-quarters, too, are light and taper 
<A NAME="404"></A>again, in order to conform to the movement of the front and not by their 
<A NAME="405"></A>breadth to suck the air.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="406"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>So much then for these questions. But why an animal that is to 
<A NAME="408"></A>stand erect must necessarily be not only a biped, but must also have the 
<A NAME="409"></A>superior parts of the body lighter, and those that lie under these heavier, 
<A NAME="410"></A>is plain. Only if situated like this could it possibly carry itself easily. 
<A NAME="411"></A>And so man, the only erect animal, has legs longer and stouter relatively 
<A NAME="412"></A>to the upper parts of his body than any other animal with legs. What we 
<A NAME="413"></A>observe in children also is evidence of this. Children cannot walk erect 
<A NAME="414"></A>because they are always dwarf-like, the upper parts of their bodies being 
<A NAME="415"></A>longer and stouter than the lower. With advancing years the lower increase 
<A NAME="416"></A>disproportionately, until the children get their appropriate size, and 
<A NAME="417"></A>then and not till then they succeed in walking erect. Birds are hunchbacked 
<A NAME="418"></A>yet stand on two legs because their weight is set back, after the principle 
<A NAME="419"></A>of horses fashioned in bronze with their forelegs prancing. But their being 
<A NAME="420"></A>bipeds and able to stand is above all due to their having the hip-bone 
<A NAME="421"></A>shaped like a thigh, and so large that it looks as if they had two thighs, 
<A NAME="422"></A>one in the leg before the knee-joint, the other joining his part to the 
<A NAME="423"></A>fundament. Really this is not a thigh but a hip, and if it were not so 
<A NAME="424"></A>large the bird could not be a biped. As in a man or a quadruped, the thigh 
<A NAME="425"></A>and the rest of the leg would be attached immediately to quite a small 
<A NAME="426"></A>hip; consequently the whole body would be tilted forward. As it is, however, 
<A NAME="427"></A>the hip is long and extends right along to the middle of the belly, so 
<A NAME="428"></A>that the legs are attached at that point and carry as supports the whole 
<A NAME="429"></A>frame. It is also evident from these considerations that a bird cannot 
<A NAME="430"></A>possibly be erect in the sense in which man is. For as it holds its body 
<A NAME="431"></A>now the wings are naturally useful to it, but if it were erect they would 
<A NAME="432"></A>be as useless as the wings of Cupids we see in pictures. It must have been 
<A NAME="433"></A>clear as soon as we spoke that the form of no human nor any similar being 
<A NAME="434"></A>permits of wings; not only because it would, though Sanguineous, be moved 
<A NAME="435"></A>at more than four points, but also because to have wings would be useless 
<A NAME="436"></A>to it when moving naturally. And Nature makes nothing contrary to her own 
<A NAME="437"></A>nature.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="438"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>We have stated above that without flexion in the legs or shoulders 
<A NAME="440"></A>and hips no Sanguineous animal with feet could progress, and that flexion 
<A NAME="441"></A>is impossible except some point be at rest, and that men and birds, both 
<A NAME="442"></A>bipeds, bend their legs in opposite directions, and further that quadrupeds 
<A NAME="443"></A>bend their in opposite directions, and each pair in the opposite way to 
<A NAME="444"></A>a man's limbs. For men bend their arms backwards, their legs forwards; 
<A NAME="445"></A>quadrupeds their forelegs forwards, their back legs backwards, and in like 
<A NAME="446"></A>manner also birds bend theirs. The reason is that Nature's workmanship 
<A NAME="447"></A>is never purposeless, as we said above, but everything for the best possible 
<A NAME="448"></A>in the circumstances. Inasmuch, therefore, as all creatures which naturally 
<A NAME="449"></A>have the power of changing position by the use of limbs, must have one 
<A NAME="450"></A>leg stationary with the weight of the body on it, and when they move forward 
<A NAME="451"></A>the leg which has the leading position must be unencumbered, and the progression 
<A NAME="452"></A>continuing the weight must shift and be taken off on this leading leg, 
<A NAME="453"></A>it is evidently necessary for the back leg from being bent to become straight 
<A NAME="454"></A>again, while the point of movement of the leg thrust forward and its lower 
<A NAME="455"></A>part remain still. And so the legs must be jointed. And it is possible 
<A NAME="456"></A>for this to take place and at the same time for the animal to go forward, 
<A NAME="457"></A>if the leading leg has its articulation forwards, impossible if it be backwards. 
<A NAME="458"></A>For, if it be forwards, the stretching out of the leg will be while the 
<A NAME="459"></A>body is going forwards, but, if the other way, while it is going backwards. 
<A NAME="460"></A>And again, if the flexion were backwards, the placing of the foot would 
<A NAME="461"></A>be made by two movements and those contrary to one another, one, that is, 
<A NAME="462"></A>backwards and one forwards; for in the bending together of the limb the 
<A NAME="463"></A>lower end of the thigh would go backwards, and the shin would move the 
<A NAME="464"></A>foot forwards away from the flexion; whereas, with the flexion forwards, 
<A NAME="465"></A>the progression described will be performed not with contrary motions, 
<A NAME="466"></A>but with one forward motion.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>Now man, being a biped and making his change of position in the 
<A NAME="468"></A>natural way with his two legs, bends them forward for the reasons set forth, 
<A NAME="469"></A>but his arms bend backwards reasonably enough. If they bent the opposite 
<A NAME="470"></A>way they would be useless for the work of the hands, and for taking food. 
<A NAME="471"></A>But quadrupeds which are also viviparous necessarily bend their front legs 
<A NAME="472"></A>forwards. For these lead off first when they move, and are also in the 
<A NAME="473"></A>forepart of their body. The reason that they bend forward is the same as 
<A NAME="474"></A>in the case of man, for in this respect they are like mankind. And so quadrupeds 
<A NAME="475"></A>as well as men bend these legs forward in the manner described. Moreover, 
<A NAME="476"></A>if the flexion is like this, they are enabled to lift their feet high; 
<A NAME="477"></A>if they bent them in the opposite way they would only lift them a little 
<A NAME="478"></A>way from the ground, because the whole thigh and the joint from which the 
<A NAME="479"></A>shin-bone springs would lie under the belly as the beast moved forward. 
<A NAME="480"></A>If, however, the flexion of the hind legs were forwards the lifting of 
<A NAME="481"></A>these feet would be similar to that of the forefeet (for the hind legs, 
<A NAME="482"></A>too, would in this case have only a little room for their lifting inasmuch 
<A NAME="483"></A>as both the thigh and the knee-joint would fall under the position of the 
<A NAME="484"></A>belly); but the flexion being backwards, as in fact it is, nothing comes 
<A NAME="485"></A>in the way of their progression with this mode of moving the feet. Moreover, 
<A NAME="486"></A>it is necessary or at least better for their legs to bend thus when they 
<A NAME="487"></A>are suckling their young, with a view to such ministrations. If the flexion 
<A NAME="488"></A>were inwards it would be difficult to keep their young under them and to 
<A NAME="489"></A>shelter them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="490"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>Now there are four modes of flexion if we take the combinations 
<A NAME="492"></A>in pairs. Fore and hind may bend either both backwards, as the figures 
<A NAME="493"></A>marked A, or in the opposite way both forwards, as in B, or in converse 
<A NAME="494"></A>ways and not in the same direction, as in C where the fore bend forwards 
<A NAME="495"></A>and the hind bend backwards, or as in D, the opposite way to C, where the 
<A NAME="496"></A>convexities are turned towards one another and the concavities outwards. 
<A NAME="497"></A>Now no biped or quadruped bends his limbs like the figures A or B, but 
<A NAME="498"></A>the quadrupeds like C, and like D only the elephant among quadrupeds and 
<A NAME="499"></A>man if you consider his arms as well as his legs. For he bends his arms 
<A NAME="500"></A>concavely and his legs convexly.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>In man, too, the flexions of the limbs are always alternately opposite, 
<A NAME="502"></A>for example the elbow bends back, but the wrist of the hand forwards, and 
<A NAME="503"></A>again the shoulder forwards. In like fashion, too, in the case of the legs, 
<A NAME="504"></A>the hip backwards, the knee forwards, the ankle in the opposite way backwards. 
<A NAME="505"></A>And plainly the lower limbs are opposed in this respect to the upper, because 
<A NAME="506"></A>the first joints are opposites, the shoulder bending forwards, the hip 
<A NAME="507"></A>backwards; wherefore also the ankle bends backwards, and the wrist of the 
<A NAME="508"></A>hand forwards.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="509"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>This is the way then the limbs bend, and for the reasons given. 
<A NAME="511"></A>But the hind limbs move criss-cross with the fore limbs; after the off 
<A NAME="512"></A>fore they move the near hind, then the near fore, and then the off hind. 
<A NAME="513"></A>The reason is that (a) if they moved the forelegs together and first, the 
<A NAME="514"></A>animal would be wrenched, and the progression would be a stumbling forwards 
<A NAME="515"></A>with the hind parts as it were dragged after. Again, that would not be 
<A NAME="516"></A>walking but jumping, and it is hard to make a continuous change of place, 
<A NAME="517"></A>jumping all the time. Here is evidence of what I say; even as it is, all 
<A NAME="518"></A>horses that move in this way soon begin to refuse, for example the horses 
<A NAME="519"></A>in a religious procession. For these reasons the fore limbs and the hind 
<A NAME="520"></A>limbs move in this separate way. Again, (b) if they moved both the right 
<A NAME="521"></A>legs first the weight would be outside the supporting limbs and they would 
<A NAME="522"></A>fall. If then it is necessary to move in one or other of these ways or 
<A NAME="523"></A>criss-cross fashion, and neither of these two is satisfactory, they must 
<A NAME="524"></A>move criss-cross; for moving in the way we have said they cannot possibly 
<A NAME="525"></A>experience either of these untoward results. And this is why horses and 
<A NAME="526"></A>such-like animals stand still with their legs put forward criss-cross, 
<A NAME="527"></A>not with the right or the left put forward together at once. In the same 
<A NAME="528"></A>fashion animals with more than four legs make their movements; if you take 
<A NAME="529"></A>two consecutive pairs of legs the hind move criss-cross with the forelegs; 
<A NAME="530"></A>you can see this if you watch them moving slowly. Even crabs move in this 
<A NAME="531"></A>way, and they are polypods. They, too, always move criss-cross in whichever 
<A NAME="532"></A>direction they are making progress. For in direction this animal has a 
<A NAME="533"></A>movement all its own; it is the only animal that moves not forwards, but 
<A NAME="534"></A>obliquely. Yet since forwards is a distinction relative to the line of 
<A NAME="535"></A>vision, Nature has made its eyes able to conform to its limbs, for its 
<A NAME="536"></A>eyes can move themselves obliquely, and therefore after a fashion crabs 
<A NAME="537"></A>are no exception but in this sense move forwards.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="538"></A><B>Part 15</B>

<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>Birds bend their legs in the same way as quadrupeds. For their 
<A NAME="540"></A>natural construction is broadly speaking nearly the same. That is, in birds 
<A NAME="541"></A>the wings are a substitute for the forelegs; and so they are bent in the 
<A NAME="542"></A>same way as the forelegs of a quadruped, since when they move to progress 
<A NAME="543"></A>the natural beginning of change is from the wings (as in quadrupeds from 
<A NAME="544"></A>the forelegs). Flight in fact is their appropriate movement. And so if 
<A NAME="545"></A>the wings be cut off a bird can neither stand still nor go 
<A NAME="546"></A>forwards.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>Again, the bird though a biped is not erect, and has the forward 
<A NAME="548"></A>parts of the body lighter than the hind, and so it is necessary (or at 
<A NAME="549"></A>least preferable for the standing posture) to have the thigh so placed 
<A NAME="550"></A>below the body as it actually is, I mean growing towards the back. If then 
<A NAME="551"></A>it must have this situation the flexion of the leg must be backwards, as 
<A NAME="552"></A>in the hind legs of quadrupeds. The reasons are the same as those given 
<A NAME="553"></A>in the case of viviparous quadrupeds.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>If now we survey generally birds and winged insects, and animals 
<A NAME="555"></A>which swim in a watery medium, all I mean that make their progress in water 
<A NAME="556"></A>by dint of organs of movement, it is not difficult to see that it is better 
<A NAME="557"></A>to have the attachment of the parts in question oblique to the frame, exactly 
<A NAME="558"></A>as in fact we see it to be both in birds and insects. And this same arrangement 
<A NAME="559"></A>obtains also among fishes. Among birds the wings are attached obliquely; 
<A NAME="560"></A>so are the fins in water animals, and the feather-like wings of insects. 
<A NAME="561"></A>In this way they divide the air or water most quickly and with most force 
<A NAME="562"></A>and so effect their movement. For the hinder parts in this way would follow 
<A NAME="563"></A>forwards as they are carried along in the yielding medium, fish in the 
<A NAME="564"></A>water, birds in the air.
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR>Of oviparous quadrupeds all those that live in holes, like crocodiles, 
<A NAME="566"></A>lizards, spotted lizards, freshwater tortoises, and turtles, have their 
<A NAME="567"></A>legs attached obliquely as their whole body sprawls over the ground, and 
<A NAME="568"></A>bend them obliquely. The reason is that this is useful for ease in creeping 
<A NAME="569"></A>into holes, and for sitting upon their eggs and guarding them. And as they 
<A NAME="570"></A>are splayed outwards they must of necessity tuck in their thighs and put 
<A NAME="571"></A>them under them in order to achieve the lifting of the whole body. In view 
<A NAME="572"></A>of this they cannot bend them otherwise than outwards.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="573"></A><B>Part 16</B>

<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>We have already stated the fact that non-sanguineous animals with 
<A NAME="575"></A>limbs are polypods and none of them quadrupeds. And the reason why their 
<A NAME="576"></A>legs, except the extreme pairs, were necessarily attached obliquely and 
<A NAME="577"></A>had their flexions upwards, and the legs themselves were somewhat turned 
<A NAME="578"></A>under (bandy-shape) and backwards is plain. In all such creatures the intermediate 
<A NAME="579"></A>legs both lead and follow. If then they lay under them, they must have 
<A NAME="580"></A>had their flexion both forwards and backwards; on account of leading, forwards; 
<A NAME="581"></A>and on account of following, backwards. Now since they have to do both, 
<A NAME="582"></A>for this reason their limbs are turned under and bent obliquely, except 
<A NAME="583"></A>the two extreme pairs. (These two are more natural in their movement, the 
<A NAME="584"></A>front leading and the back following.) Another reason for this kind of 
<A NAME="585"></A>flexion is the number of their legs; arranged in this way they would interfere 
<A NAME="586"></A>less with one another in progression and not knock together. But the reason 
<A NAME="587"></A>that they are bandy is that all of them or most of them live in holes, 
<A NAME="588"></A>for creatures living so cannot possibly be high above the 
<A NAME="589"></A>ground.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>But crabs are in nature the oddest of all polypods; they do not 
<A NAME="591"></A>progress forwards except in the sense explained above, they are the only 
<A NAME="592"></A>animals which have more than one pair of leading limbs. The explanation 
<A NAME="593"></A>of this is the hardness of their limbs, and the fact that they use them 
<A NAME="594"></A>not for swimming but for walking; they always keep on the ground. However, 
<A NAME="595"></A>the flexion of the limbs of all polypods is oblique, like that of the quadrupeds 
<A NAME="596"></A>which live in holes-for example lizards and crocodiles and most of the 
<A NAME="597"></A>oviparous quadrupeds. And the explanation is that some of them in their 
<A NAME="598"></A>breeding periods, and some all their life, live in holes.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="599"></A><B>Part 17</B>

<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR>Now the rest have bandy legs because they are soft-skinned, but 
<A NAME="601"></A>the crayfish is hard-skinned and its limbs are for swimming and not for 
<A NAME="602"></A>walking (and so are not bandy). Crabs, too, have their limbs bent obliquely, 
<A NAME="603"></A>but not bandy like oviparous quadrupeds and non-sanguineous polypods, because 
<A NAME="604"></A>their limbs have a hard and shell-like skin, although they don't swim but 
<A NAME="605"></A>live in holes; they live in fact on the ground. Moreover, their shape is 
<A NAME="606"></A>like a disk, as compared with the crayfish which is elongated, and they 
<A NAME="607"></A>haven't a tail like the crayfish; a tail is useful to the crayfish for 
<A NAME="608"></A>swimming, but the crab is not a swimming creature. Further, it alone has 
<A NAME="609"></A>its side equivalent to a hinder part, because it has many leading feet. 
<A NAME="610"></A>The explanation of this is that its flexions are not forward nor its legs 
<A NAME="611"></A>turned in under (bandy). We have given above the reason why its legs are 
<A NAME="612"></A>not turned in under, that is the hardness and shell-like character of its 
<A NAME="613"></A>integument.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>For these reasons then it must lead off with more than one limb, 
<A NAME="615"></A>and move obliquely; obliquely, because the flexion is oblique; and with 
<A NAME="616"></A>more than one limb, because otherwise the limbs that were still would have 
<A NAME="617"></A>got in the way of those that were moving.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR>Fishes of the flat kind swim with their heads twisted, as one-eyed 
<A NAME="619"></A>men walk; they have their natural shape distorted. Web-footed birds swim 
<A NAME="620"></A>with their feet; because they breath the air and have lungs they are bipeds, 
<A NAME="621"></A>but because they have their home in the water they are webbed; by this 
<A NAME="622"></A>arrangement their feet serve them instead of fins. They have their legs 
<A NAME="623"></A>too, not like the rest of birds in the centre of their body, but rather 
<A NAME="624"></A>set back. Their legs are short, and being set back are serviceable for 
<A NAME="625"></A>swimming. The reason for their having short legs is that nature has added 
<A NAME="626"></A>to their feet by subtracting from the length of their limbs; instead of 
<A NAME="627"></A>length she gives stoutness to the legs and breadth to the feet. Broad feet 
<A NAME="628"></A>are more useful than long for pushing away the water when they are 
<A NAME="629"></A>swimming.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="630"></A><B>Part 18</B>

<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>There is reason, too, for winged creatures having feet, but fish 
<A NAME="632"></A>none. The former have their home in the dry medium, and cannot remain always 
<A NAME="633"></A>in mid air; they must therefore have feet. Fish on the contrary live in 
<A NAME="634"></A>the wet medium, and take in water, not air. Fins are useful for swimming, 
<A NAME="635"></A>but feet not. And if they had both they would be non-sanguineous. There 
<A NAME="636"></A>is a broad similarity between birds and fishes in the organs of locomotion. 
<A NAME="637"></A>Birds have their wings on the superior part, similarly fish have two pectoral 
<A NAME="638"></A>fins; again, birds have legs on their under parts and near the wings; similarly, 
<A NAME="639"></A>most fish have two fins on the under parts and near the pectorals. Birds, 
<A NAME="640"></A>too, have a tail and fish a tail-fin.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="641"></A><B>Part 19</B>

<A NAME="642"></A><BR><BR>A difficulty may be suggested as to the movements of molluscs, 
<A NAME="643"></A>that is, as to where that movement originates; for they have no distinction 
<A NAME="644"></A>of left and right. Now observation shows them moving. We must, I think, 
<A NAME="645"></A>treat all this class as mutilated, and as moving in the way in which limbed 
<A NAME="646"></A>creatures do when one cuts off their legs, or as analogous with the seal 
<A NAME="647"></A>and the bat. Both the latter are quadrupeds but misshapen. Now molluscs 
<A NAME="648"></A>do move, but move in a manner contrary to nature. They are not moving things, 
<A NAME="649"></A>but are moving if as sedentary creatures they are compared with zoophytes, 
<A NAME="650"></A>and sedentary if classed with progressing animals.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR>As to right and left, crabs, too, show the distinction poorly, 
<A NAME="652"></A>still they do show it. You can see it in the claw; the right claw is larger 
<A NAME="653"></A>and stronger, as though the right and left sides were trying to get 
<A NAME="654"></A>distinguished.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>The structure of animals, both in their other parts, and especially 
<A NAME="656"></A>in those which concern progression and any movement in place, is as we 
<A NAME="657"></A>have now described. It remains, after determining these questions, to investigate 
<A NAME="658"></A>the problems of Life and Death.
