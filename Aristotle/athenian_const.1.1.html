<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>...[They were tried] by a court empanelled from among the noble families, 
<A NAME="12"></A>and sworn upon the sacrifices. The part of accuser was taken by Myron. 
<A NAME="13"></A>They were found guilty of the sacrilege, and their bodies were cast out 
<A NAME="14"></A>of their graves and their race banished for evermore. In view of this expiation, 
<A NAME="15"></A>Epimenides the Cretan performed a purification of the 
<A NAME="16"></A>city.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="17"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>After this event there was contention for a long time between the 
<A NAME="19"></A>upper classes and the populace. Not only was the constitution at this time 
<A NAME="20"></A>oligarchical in every respect, but the poorer classes, men, women, and 
<A NAME="21"></A>children, were the serfs of the rich. They were known as Pelatae and also 
<A NAME="22"></A>as Hectemori, because they cultivated the lands of the rich at the rent 
<A NAME="23"></A>thus indicated. The whole country was in the hands of a few persons, and 
<A NAME="24"></A>if the tenants failed to pay their rent they were liable to be haled into 
<A NAME="25"></A>slavery, and their children with them. All loans secured upon the debtor's 
<A NAME="26"></A>person, a custom which prevailed until the time of Solon, who was the first 
<A NAME="27"></A>to appear as the champion of the people. But the hardest and bitterest 
<A NAME="28"></A>part of the constitution in the eyes of the masses was their state of serfdom. 
<A NAME="29"></A>Not but what they were also discontented with every other feature of their 
<A NAME="30"></A>lot; for, to speak generally, they had no part nor share in 
<A NAME="31"></A>anything.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="32"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>Now the ancient constitution, as it existed before the time of 
<A NAME="34"></A>Draco, was organized as follows. The magistrates were elected according 
<A NAME="35"></A>to qualifications of birth and wealth. At first they governed for life, 
<A NAME="36"></A>but subsequently for terms of ten years. The first magistrates, both in 
<A NAME="37"></A>date and in importance, were the King, the Polemarch, and the Archon. The 
<A NAME="38"></A>earliest of these offices was that of the King, which existed from ancestral 
<A NAME="39"></A>antiquity. To this was added, secondly, the office of Polemarch, on account 
<A NAME="40"></A>of some of the kings proving feeble in war; for it was on this account 
<A NAME="41"></A>that Ion was invited to accept the post on an occasion of pressing need. 
<A NAME="42"></A>The last of the three offices was that of the Archon, which most authorities 
<A NAME="43"></A>state to have come into existence in the time of Medon. Others assign it 
<A NAME="44"></A>to the time of Acastus, and adduce as proof the fact that the nine Archons 
<A NAME="45"></A>swear to execute their oaths 'as in the days of Acastus,' which seems to 
<A NAME="46"></A>suggest that it was in his time that the descendants of Codrus retired 
<A NAME="47"></A>from the kingship in return for the prerogatives conferred upon the Archon. 
<A NAME="48"></A>Whichever way it may be, the difference in date is small; but that it was 
<A NAME="49"></A>the last of these magistracies to be created is shown by the fact that 
<A NAME="50"></A>the Archon has no part in the ancestral sacrifices, as the King and the 
<A NAME="51"></A>Polemarch have, but exclusively in those of later origin. So it is only 
<A NAME="52"></A>at a comparatively late date that the office of Archon has become of great 
<A NAME="53"></A>importance, through the dignity conferred by these later additions. The 
<A NAME="54"></A>Thesmothetae were many years afterwards, when these offices had already 
<A NAME="55"></A>become annual, with the object that they might publicly record all legal 
<A NAME="56"></A>decisions, and act as guardians of them with a view to determining the 
<A NAME="57"></A>issues between litigants. Accordingly their office, alone of those which 
<A NAME="58"></A>have been mentioned, was never of more than annual duration.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>Such, then, is the relative chronological precedence of these offices. 
<A NAME="60"></A>At that time the nine Archons did not all live together. The King occupied 
<A NAME="61"></A>the building now known as the Boculium, near the Prytaneum, as may be seen 
<A NAME="62"></A>from the fact that even to the present day the marriage of the King's wife 
<A NAME="63"></A>to Dionysus takes place there. The Archon lived in the Prytaneum, the Polemarch 
<A NAME="64"></A>in the Epilyceum. The latter building was formerly called the Polemarcheum, 
<A NAME="65"></A>but after Epilycus, during his term of office as Polemarch, had rebuilt 
<A NAME="66"></A>it and fitted it up, it was called the Epilyceum. The Thesmothetae occupied 
<A NAME="67"></A>the Thesmotheteum. In the time of Solon, however, they all came together 
<A NAME="68"></A>into the Thesmotheteum. They had power to decide cases finally on their 
<A NAME="69"></A>own authority, not, as now, merely to hold a preliminary hearing. Such 
<A NAME="70"></A>then was the arrangement of the magistracies. The Council of Areopagus 
<A NAME="71"></A>had as its constitutionally assigned duty the protection of the laws; but 
<A NAME="72"></A>in point of fact it administered the greater and most important part of 
<A NAME="73"></A>the government of the state, and inflicted personal punishments and fines 
<A NAME="74"></A>summarily upon all who misbehaved themselves. This was the natural consequence 
<A NAME="75"></A>of the facts that the Archons were elected under qualifications of birth 
<A NAME="76"></A>and wealth, and that the Areopagus was composed of those who had served 
<A NAME="77"></A>as Archons; for which latter reason the membership of the Areopagus is 
<A NAME="78"></A>the only office which has continued to be a life-magistracy to the present 
<A NAME="79"></A>day.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="80"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>Such was, in outline, the first constitution, but not very long 
<A NAME="82"></A>after the events above recorded, in the archonship of Aristaichmus, Draco 
<A NAME="83"></A>enacted his ordinances. Now his constitution had the following form. The 
<A NAME="84"></A>franchise was given to all who could furnish themselves with a military 
<A NAME="85"></A>equipment. The nine Archons and the Treasurers were elected by this body 
<A NAME="86"></A>from persons possessing an unencumbered property of not less than ten minas, 
<A NAME="87"></A>the less important officials from those who could furnish themselves with 
<A NAME="88"></A>a military equipment, and the generals [Strategi] and commanders of the 
<A NAME="89"></A>cavalry [Hipparchi] from those who could show an unencumbered property 
<A NAME="90"></A>of not less than a hundred minas, and had children born in lawful wedlock 
<A NAME="91"></A>over ten years of age. These officers were required to hold to bail the 
<A NAME="92"></A>Prytanes, the Strategi, and the Hipparchi of the preceding year until their 
<A NAME="93"></A>accounts had been audited, taking four securities of the same class as 
<A NAME="94"></A>that to which the Strategi and the Hipparchi belonged. There was also to 
<A NAME="95"></A>be a Council, consisting of four hundred and one members, elected by lot 
<A NAME="96"></A>from among those who possessed the franchise. Both for this and for the 
<A NAME="97"></A>other magistracies the lot was cast among those who were over thirty years 
<A NAME="98"></A>of age; and no one might hold office twice until every one else had had 
<A NAME="99"></A>his turn, after which they were to cast the lot afresh. If any member of 
<A NAME="100"></A>the Council failed to attend when there was a sitting of the Council or 
<A NAME="101"></A>of the Assembly, he paid a fine, to the amount of three drachmas if he 
<A NAME="102"></A>was a Pentacosiomedimnus, two if he was a Knight, and One if he was a Zeugites. 
<A NAME="103"></A>The Council of Areopagus was guardian of the laws, and kept watch over 
<A NAME="104"></A>the magistrates to see that they executed their offices in accordance with 
<A NAME="105"></A>the laws. Any person who felt himself wronged might lay an information 
<A NAME="106"></A>before the Council of Areopagus, on declaring what law was broken by the 
<A NAME="107"></A>wrong done to him. But, as has been said before, loans were secured upon 
<A NAME="108"></A>the persons of the debtors, and the land was in the hands of a 
<A NAME="109"></A>few.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="110"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>Since such, then, was the organization of the constitution, and 
<A NAME="112"></A>the many were in slavery to the few, the people rose against the upper 
<A NAME="113"></A>class. The strife was keen, and for a long time the two parties were ranged 
<A NAME="114"></A>in hostile camps against one another, till at last, by common consent, 
<A NAME="115"></A>they appointed Solon to be mediator and Archon, and committed the whole 
<A NAME="116"></A>constitution to his hands. The immediate occasion of his appointment was 
<A NAME="117"></A>his poem, which begins with the words:
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>I behold, and within my heart deep sadness has claimed its 
<A NAME="119"></A>place,
<A NAME="120"></A><BR>As I mark the oldest home of the ancient Ionian 
<A NAME="121"></A>race
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Slain by the sword.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>In this poem he fights and disputes on behalf of each party in 
<A NAME="124"></A>turn against the other, and finally he advises them to come to terms and 
<A NAME="125"></A>put an end to the quarrel existing between them. By birth and reputation 
<A NAME="126"></A>Solon was one of the foremost men of the day, but in wealth and position 
<A NAME="127"></A>he was of the middle class, as is generally agreed, and is, indeed, established 
<A NAME="128"></A>by his own evidence in these poems, where he exhorts the wealthy not to 
<A NAME="129"></A>be grasping.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>But ye who have store of good, who are sated and 
<A NAME="131"></A>overflow,
<A NAME="132"></A><BR>Restrain your swelling soul, and still it and keep it 
<A NAME="133"></A>low:
<A NAME="134"></A><BR>Let the heart that is great within you be trained a lowlier 
<A NAME="135"></A>way;
<A NAME="136"></A><BR>Ye shall not have all at your will, and we will not for ever 
<A NAME="137"></A>obey.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, he constantly fastens the blame of the conflict on the 
<A NAME="139"></A>rich; and accordingly at the beginning of the poem he says that he fears 
<A NAME="140"></A>'the love of wealth and an overweening mind', evidently meaning that it 
<A NAME="141"></A>was through these that the quarrel arose.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="142"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>As soon as he was at the head of affairs, Solon liberated the people 
<A NAME="144"></A>once and for all, by prohibiting all loans on the security of the debtor's 
<A NAME="145"></A>person: and in addition he made laws by which he cancelled all debts, public 
<A NAME="146"></A>and private. This measure is commonly called the Seisachtheia [= removal 
<A NAME="147"></A>of burdens], since thereby the people had their loads removed from them. 
<A NAME="148"></A>In connexion with it some persons try to traduce the character of Solon. 
<A NAME="149"></A>It so happened that, when he was about to enact the Seisachtheia, he communicated 
<A NAME="150"></A>his intention to some members of the upper class, whereupon, as the partisans 
<A NAME="151"></A>of the popular party say, his friends stole a march on him; while those 
<A NAME="152"></A>who wish to attack his character maintain that he too had a share in the 
<A NAME="153"></A>fraud himself. For these persons borrowed money and bought up a large amount 
<A NAME="154"></A>of land, and so when, a short time afterwards, all debts were cancelled, 
<A NAME="155"></A>they became wealthy; and this, they say, was the origin of the families 
<A NAME="156"></A>which were afterwards looked on as having been wealthy from primeval times. 
<A NAME="157"></A>However, the story of the popular party is by far the most probable. A 
<A NAME="158"></A>man who was so moderate and public-spirited in all his other actions, that 
<A NAME="159"></A>when it was within his power to put his fellow-citizens beneath his feet 
<A NAME="160"></A>and establish himself as tyrant, he preferred instead to incur the hostility 
<A NAME="161"></A>of both parties by placing his honour and the general welfare above his 
<A NAME="162"></A>personal aggrandisement, is not likely to have consented to defile his 
<A NAME="163"></A>hands by such a petty and palpable fraud. That he had this absolute power 
<A NAME="164"></A>is, in the first place, indicated by the desperate condition the country; 
<A NAME="165"></A>moreover, he mentions it himself repeatedly in his poems, and it is universally 
<A NAME="166"></A>admitted. We are therefore bound to consider this accusation to be 
<A NAME="167"></A>false.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="168"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>Next Solon drew up a constitution and enacted new laws; and the 
<A NAME="170"></A>ordinances of Draco ceased to be used, with the exception of those relating 
<A NAME="171"></A>to murder. The laws were inscribed on the wooden stands, and set up in 
<A NAME="172"></A>the King's Porch, and all swore to obey them; and the nine Archons made 
<A NAME="173"></A>oath upon the stone, declaring that they would dedicate a golden statue 
<A NAME="174"></A>if they should transgress any of them. This is the origin of the oath to 
<A NAME="175"></A>that effect which they take to the present day. Solon ratified his laws 
<A NAME="176"></A>for a hundred years; and the following was the fashion in which he organized 
<A NAME="177"></A>the constitution. He divided the population according to property into 
<A NAME="178"></A>four classes, just as it had been divided before, namely, Pentacosiomedimni, 
<A NAME="179"></A>Knights, Zeugitae, and Thetes. The various magistracies, namely, the nine 
<A NAME="180"></A>Archons, the Treasurers, the Commissioners for Public Contracts (Poletae), 
<A NAME="181"></A>the Eleven, and Clerks (Colacretae), he assigned to the Pentacosiomedimni, 
<A NAME="182"></A>the Knights, and the Zeugitae, giving offices to each class in proportion 
<A NAME="183"></A>to the value of their rateable property. To who ranked among the Thetes 
<A NAME="184"></A>he gave nothing but a place in the Assembly and in the juries. A man had 
<A NAME="185"></A>to rank as a Pentacosiomedimnus if he made, from his own land, five hundred 
<A NAME="186"></A>measures, whether liquid or solid. Those ranked as Knights who made three 
<A NAME="187"></A>hundred measures, or, as some say, those who were able to maintain a horse. 
<A NAME="188"></A>In support of the latter definition they adduce the name of the class, 
<A NAME="189"></A>which may be supposed to be derived from this fact, and also some votive 
<A NAME="190"></A>offerings of early times; for in the Acropolis there is a votive offering, 
<A NAME="191"></A>a statue of Diphilus, bearing this inscription:
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>The son of Diphilus, Athenion hight,
<A NAME="193"></A><BR>Raised from the Thetes and become a knight,
<A NAME="194"></A><BR>Did to the gods this sculptured charger bring,
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>For his promotion a thank-offering. And a horse stands in evidence 
<A NAME="196"></A>beside the man, implying that this was what was meant by belonging to the 
<A NAME="197"></A>rank of Knight. At the same time it seems reasonable to suppose that this 
<A NAME="198"></A>class, like the Pentacosiomedimni, was defined by the possession of an 
<A NAME="199"></A>income of a certain number of measures. Those ranked as Zeugitae who made 
<A NAME="200"></A>two hundred measures, liquid or solid; and the rest ranked as Thetes, and 
<A NAME="201"></A>were not eligible for any office. Hence it is that even at the present 
<A NAME="202"></A>day, when a candidate for any office is asked to what class he belongs, 
<A NAME="203"></A>no one would think of saying that he belonged to the 
<A NAME="204"></A>Thetes.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="205"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>The elections to the various offices Solon enacted should be by 
<A NAME="207"></A>lot, out of candidates selected by each of the tribes. Each tribe selected 
<A NAME="208"></A>ten candidates for the nine archonships, and among these the lot was cast. 
<A NAME="209"></A>Hence it is still the custom for each tribe to choose ten candidates by 
<A NAME="210"></A>lot, and then the lot is again cast among these. A proof that Solon regulated 
<A NAME="211"></A>the elections to office according to the property classes may be found 
<A NAME="212"></A>in the law still in force with regard to the Treasurers, which enacts that 
<A NAME="213"></A>they shall be chosen from the Pentacosiomedimni. Such was Solon's legislation 
<A NAME="214"></A>with respect to the nine Archons; whereas in early times the Council of 
<A NAME="215"></A>Areopagus summoned suitable persons according to its own judgement and 
<A NAME="216"></A>appointed them for the year to the several offices. There were four tribes, 
<A NAME="217"></A>as before, and four tribe-kings. Each tribe was divided into three Trittyes 
<A NAME="218"></A>[=Thirds], with twelve Naucraries in each; and the Naucraries had officers 
<A NAME="219"></A>of their own, called Naucrari, whose duty it was to superintend the current 
<A NAME="220"></A>receipts and expenditure. Hence, among the laws of Solon now obsolete, 
<A NAME="221"></A>it is repeatedly written that the Naucrari are to receive and to spend 
<A NAME="222"></A>out of the Naucraric fund. Solon also appointed a Council of four hundred, 
<A NAME="223"></A>a hundred from each tribe; but he assigned to the Council of the Areopagus 
<A NAME="224"></A>the duty of superintending the laws, acting as before as the guardian of 
<A NAME="225"></A>the constitution in general. It kept watch over the affairs of the state 
<A NAME="226"></A>in most of the more important matters, and corrected offenders, with full 
<A NAME="227"></A>powers to inflict either fines or personal punishment. The money received 
<A NAME="228"></A>in fines it brought up into the Acropolis, without assigning the reason 
<A NAME="229"></A>for the mulct. It also tried those who conspired for the overthrow of the 
<A NAME="230"></A>state, Solon having enacted a process of impeachment to deal with such 
<A NAME="231"></A>offenders. Further, since he saw the state often engaged in internal disputes, 
<A NAME="232"></A>while many of the citizens from sheer indifference accepted whatever might 
<A NAME="233"></A>turn up, he made a law with express reference to such persons, enacting 
<A NAME="234"></A>that any one who, in a time civil factions, did not take up arms with either 
<A NAME="235"></A>party, should lose his rights as a citizen and cease to have any part in 
<A NAME="236"></A>the state.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="237"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>Such, then, was his legislation concerning the magistracies. There 
<A NAME="239"></A>are three points in the constitution of Solon which appear to be its most 
<A NAME="240"></A>democratic features: first and most important, the prohibition of loans 
<A NAME="241"></A>on the security of the debtor's person; secondly, the right of every person 
<A NAME="242"></A>who so willed to claim redress on behalf of any one to whom wrong was being 
<A NAME="243"></A>done; thirdly, the institution of the appeal to the jurycourts; and it 
<A NAME="244"></A>is to this last, they say, that the masses have owed their strength most 
<A NAME="245"></A>of all, since, when the democracy is master of the voting-power, it is 
<A NAME="246"></A>master of the constitution. Moreover, since the laws were not drawn up 
<A NAME="247"></A>in simple and explicit terms (but like the one concerning inheritances 
<A NAME="248"></A>and wards of state), disputes inevitably occurred, and the courts had to 
<A NAME="249"></A>decide in every matter, whether public or private. Some persons in fact 
<A NAME="250"></A>believe that Solon deliberately made the laws indefinite, in order that 
<A NAME="251"></A>the final decision might be in the hands of the people. This, however, 
<A NAME="252"></A>is not probable, and the reason no doubt was that it is impossible to attain 
<A NAME="253"></A>ideal perfection when framing a law in general terms; for we must judge 
<A NAME="254"></A>of his intentions, not from the actual results in the present day, but 
<A NAME="255"></A>from the general tenor of the rest of his legislation.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="256"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>These seem to be the democratic features of his laws; but in addition, 
<A NAME="258"></A>before the period of his legislation, he carried through his abolition 
<A NAME="259"></A>of debts, and after it his increase in the standards of weights and measures, 
<A NAME="260"></A>and of the currency. During his administration the measures were made larger 
<A NAME="261"></A>than those of Pheidon, and the mina, which previously had a standard of 
<A NAME="262"></A>seventy drachmas, was raised to the full hundred. The standard coin in 
<A NAME="263"></A>earlier times was the two-drachma piece. He also made weights corresponding 
<A NAME="264"></A>with the coinage, sixty-three minas going to the talent; and the odd three 
<A NAME="265"></A>minas were distributed among the staters and the other 
<A NAME="266"></A>values.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="267"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>When he had completed his organization of the constitution in the 
<A NAME="269"></A>manner that has been described, he found himself beset by people coming 
<A NAME="270"></A>to him and harassing him concerning his laws, criticizing here and questioning 
<A NAME="271"></A>there, till, as he wished neither to alter what he had decided on nor yet 
<A NAME="272"></A>to be an object of ill will to every one by remaining in Athens, he set 
<A NAME="273"></A>off on a journey to Egypt, with the combined objects of trade and travel, 
<A NAME="274"></A>giving out that he should not return for ten years. He considered that 
<A NAME="275"></A>there was no call for him to expound the laws personally, but that every 
<A NAME="276"></A>one should obey them just as they were written. Moreover, his position 
<A NAME="277"></A>at this time was unpleasant. Many members of the upper class had been estranged 
<A NAME="278"></A>from him on account of his abolition of debts, and both parties were alienated 
<A NAME="279"></A>through their disappointment at the condition of things which he had created. 
<A NAME="280"></A>The mass of the people had expected him to make a complete redistribution 
<A NAME="281"></A>of all property, and the upper class hoped he would restore everything 
<A NAME="282"></A>to its former position, or, at any rate, make but a small change. Solon, 
<A NAME="283"></A>however, had resisted both classes. He might have made himself a despot 
<A NAME="284"></A>by attaching himself to whichever party he chose, but he preferred, though 
<A NAME="285"></A>at the cost of incurring the enmity of both, to be the saviour of his country 
<A NAME="286"></A>and the ideal lawgiver.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="287"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>The truth of this view of Solon's policy is established alike by 
<A NAME="289"></A>common consent, and by the mention he has himself made of the matter in 
<A NAME="290"></A>his poems. Thus:
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>I gave to the mass of the people such rank as befitted their 
<A NAME="292"></A>need,
<A NAME="293"></A><BR>I took not away their honour, and I granted naught to their 
<A NAME="294"></A>greed;
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>While those who were rich in power, who in wealth were glorious 
<A NAME="296"></A>and
<A NAME="297"></A><BR>great,
<A NAME="298"></A><BR>I bethought me that naught should befall them unworthy 
<A NAME="299"></A>their
<A NAME="300"></A><BR>splendour and state;
<A NAME="301"></A><BR>So I stood with my shield outstretched, and both were sale in 
<A NAME="302"></A>its
<A NAME="303"></A><BR>sight,
<A NAME="304"></A><BR>And I would not that either should triumph, when the triumph 
<A NAME="305"></A>was
<A NAME="306"></A><BR>not with right.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>Again he declares how the mass of the people ought to be treated: 
<A NAME="308"></A>But thus will the people best the voice of their leaders obey, When neither 
<A NAME="309"></A>too slack is the rein, nor violence holdeth the sway; For indulgence breedeth 
<A NAME="310"></A>a child, the presumption that spurns control,
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>When riches too great are poured upon men of unbalanced 
<A NAME="312"></A>soul.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>And again elsewhere he speaks about the persons who wished to redistribute 
<A NAME="314"></A>the land: So they came in search of plunder, and their cravings knew no 
<A NAME="315"></A>hound, Every one among them deeming endless wealth would here be found. 
<A NAME="316"></A>And that I with glozing smoothness hid a cruel mind within. Fondly then 
<A NAME="317"></A>and vainly dreamt they; now they raise an angry din, And they glare askance 
<A NAME="318"></A>in anger, and the light within their eyes Burns with hostile flames upon 
<A NAME="319"></A>me. Yet therein no justice lies. All I promised, fully wrought I with the 
<A NAME="320"></A>gods at hand to cheer, Naught beyond in folly ventured. Never to my soul 
<A NAME="321"></A>was dear With a tyrant's force to govern, nor to see the good and base 
<A NAME="322"></A>Side by side in equal portion share the rich home of our 
<A NAME="323"></A>race.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>Once more he speaks of the abolition of debts and of those who 
<A NAME="325"></A>before were in servitude, but were released owing to the 
<A NAME="326"></A>Seisachtheia:
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>Of all the aims for which I summoned forth
<A NAME="328"></A><BR>The people, was there one I compassed not?
<A NAME="329"></A><BR>Thou, when slow time brings justice in its train,
<A NAME="330"></A><BR>O mighty mother of the Olympian gods,
<A NAME="331"></A><BR>Dark Earth, thou best canst witness, from whose 
<A NAME="332"></A>breast
<A NAME="333"></A><BR>I swept the pillars broadcast planted there,
<A NAME="334"></A><BR>And made thee free, who hadst been slave of yore.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR>And many a man whom fraud or law had sold
<A NAME="336"></A><BR>For from his god-built land, an outcast slave,
<A NAME="337"></A><BR>I brought again to Athens; yea, and some,
<A NAME="338"></A><BR>Exiles from home through debt's oppressive load,
<A NAME="339"></A><BR>Speaking no more the dear Athenian tongue,
<A NAME="340"></A><BR>But wandering far and wide, I brought again;
<A NAME="341"></A><BR>And those that here in vilest slavery
<A NAME="342"></A><BR>Crouched 'neath a master's frown, I set them free.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR>Thus might and right were yoked in harmony,
<A NAME="344"></A><BR>Since by the force of law I won my ends
<A NAME="345"></A><BR>And kept my promise. Equal laws I gave
<A NAME="346"></A><BR>To evil and to good, with even hand
<A NAME="347"></A><BR>Drawing straight justice for the lot of each.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR>But had another held the goad as
<A NAME="349"></A><BR>One in whose heart was guile and greediness,
<A NAME="350"></A><BR>He had not kept the people back from strife.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR>For had I granted, now what pleased the one,
<A NAME="352"></A><BR>Then what their foes devised in counterpoise,
<A NAME="353"></A><BR>Of many a man this state had been bereft.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR>Therefore I showed my might on every side,
<A NAME="355"></A><BR>Turning at bay like wolf among the hounds.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>And again he reviles both parties for their grumblings in the times 
<A NAME="357"></A>that followed:
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>Nay, if one must lay blame where blame is due,
<A NAME="359"></A><BR>Wer't not for me, the people ne'er had set
<A NAME="360"></A><BR>Their eyes upon these blessings e'en in dreams:-
<A NAME="361"></A><BR>While greater men, the men of wealthier life,
<A NAME="362"></A><BR>Should praise me and should court me as their friend. For had any other 
<A NAME="363"></A>man, he says, received this exalted post,
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>He had not kept the people hack, nor ceased
<A NAME="365"></A><BR>Til he had robbed the richness of the milk.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR>But I stood forth a landmark in the midst,
<A NAME="367"></A><BR>And barred the foes from battle.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="368"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>Such then, were Solon's reasons for his departure from the country. 
<A NAME="370"></A>After his retirement the city was still torn by divisions. For four years, 
<A NAME="371"></A>indeed, they lived in peace; but in the fifth year after Solon's government 
<A NAME="372"></A>they were unable to elect an Archon on account of their dissensions, and 
<A NAME="373"></A>again four years later they elected no Archon for the same reason. Subsequently, 
<A NAME="374"></A>after a similar period had elapsed, Damasias was elected Archon; and he 
<A NAME="375"></A>governed for two years and two months, until he was forcibly expelled from 
<A NAME="376"></A>his office. After this, it was agreed, as a compromise, to elect ten Archons, 
<A NAME="377"></A>five from the Eupatridae, three from the Agroeci, and two from the Demiurgi, 
<A NAME="378"></A>and they ruled for the year following Damasias. It is clear from this that 
<A NAME="379"></A>the Archon was at the time the magistrate who possessed the greatest power, 
<A NAME="380"></A>since it is always in connexion with this office that conflicts are seen 
<A NAME="381"></A>to arise. But altogether they were in a continual state of internal disorder. 
<A NAME="382"></A>Some found the cause and justification of their discontent in the abolition 
<A NAME="383"></A>of debts, because thereby they had been reduced to poverty; others were 
<A NAME="384"></A>dissatisfied with the political constitution, because it had undergone 
<A NAME="385"></A>a revolutionary change; while with others the motive was found in personal 
<A NAME="386"></A>rivalries among themselves. The parties at this time were three in number. 
<A NAME="387"></A>First there was the party of the Shore, led by Megacles the son of Alcmeon, 
<A NAME="388"></A>which was considered to aim at a moderate form of government; then there 
<A NAME="389"></A>were the men of the Plain, who desired an oligarchy and were led by Lycurgus; 
<A NAME="390"></A>and thirdly there were the men of the Highlands, at the head of whom was 
<A NAME="391"></A>Pisistratus, who was looked on as an extreme democrat. This latter party 
<A NAME="392"></A>was reinforced by those who had been deprived of the debts due to them, 
<A NAME="393"></A>from motives of poverty, and by those who were not of pure descent, from 
<A NAME="394"></A>motives of personal apprehension. A proof of this is seen in the fact that 
<A NAME="395"></A>after the tyranny was overthrown a revision was made of the citizen-roll, 
<A NAME="396"></A>on the ground that many persons were partaking in the franchise without 
<A NAME="397"></A>having a right to it. The names given to the respective parties were derived 
<A NAME="398"></A>from the districts in which they held their lands.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="399"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>Pisistratus had the reputation of being an extreme democrat, and 
<A NAME="401"></A>he also had distinguished himself greatly in the war with Megara. Taking 
<A NAME="402"></A>advantage of this, he wounded himself, and by representing that his injuries 
<A NAME="403"></A>had been inflicted on him by his political rivals, he persuaded the people, 
<A NAME="404"></A>through a motion proposed by Aristion, to grant him a bodyguard. After 
<A NAME="405"></A>he had got these 'club-bearers', as they were called, he made an attack 
<A NAME="406"></A>with them on the people and seized the Acropolis. This happened in the 
<A NAME="407"></A>archonship of Comeas, thirty-one years after the legislation of Solon. 
<A NAME="408"></A>It is related that, when Pisistratus asked for his bodyguard, Solon opposed 
<A NAME="409"></A>the request, and declared that in so doing he proved himself wiser than 
<A NAME="410"></A>half the people and braver than the rest,-wiser than those who did not 
<A NAME="411"></A>see that Pisistratus designed to make himself tyrant, and braver than those 
<A NAME="412"></A>who saw it and kept silence. But when all his words availed nothing he 
<A NAME="413"></A>carried forth his armour and set it up in front of his house, saying that 
<A NAME="414"></A>he had helped his country so far as lay in his power (he was already a 
<A NAME="415"></A>very old man), and that he called on all others to do the same. Solon's 
<A NAME="416"></A>exhortations, however, proved fruitless, and Pisistratus assumed the sovereignty. 
<A NAME="417"></A>His administration was more like a constitutional government than the rule 
<A NAME="418"></A>of a tyrant; but before his power was firmly established, the adherents 
<A NAME="419"></A>of Megacles and Lycurgus made a coalition and drove him out. This took 
<A NAME="420"></A>place in the archonship of Hegesias, five years after the first establishment 
<A NAME="421"></A>of his rule. Eleven years later Megacles, being in difficulties in a party 
<A NAME="422"></A>struggle, again opened-negotiations with Pisistratus, proposing that the 
<A NAME="423"></A>latter should marry his daughter; and on these terms he brought him back 
<A NAME="424"></A>to Athens, by a very primitive and simple-minded device. He first spread 
<A NAME="425"></A>abroad a rumour that Athena was bringing back Pisistratus, and then, having 
<A NAME="426"></A>found a woman of great stature and beauty, named Phye (according to Herodotus, 
<A NAME="427"></A>of the deme of Paeania, but as others say a Thracian flower-seller of the 
<A NAME="428"></A>deme of Collytus), he dressed her in a garb resembling that of the goddess 
<A NAME="429"></A>and brought her into the city with Pisistratus. The latter drove in on 
<A NAME="430"></A>a chariot with the woman beside him, and the inhabitants of the city, struck 
<A NAME="431"></A>with awe, received him with adoration.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="432"></A><B>Part 15</B>

<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>In this manner did his first return take place. He did not, however, 
<A NAME="434"></A>hold his power long, for about six years after his return he was again 
<A NAME="435"></A>expelled. He refused to treat the daughter of Megacles as his wife, and 
<A NAME="436"></A>being afraid, in consequence, of a combination of the two opposing parties, 
<A NAME="437"></A>he retired from the country. First he led a colony to a place called Rhaicelus, 
<A NAME="438"></A>in the region of the Thermaic gulf; and thence he passed to the country 
<A NAME="439"></A>in the neighbourhood of Mt. Pangaeus. Here he acquired wealth and hired 
<A NAME="440"></A>mercenaries; and not till ten years had elapsed did he return to Eretria 
<A NAME="441"></A>and make an attempt to recover the government by force. In this he had 
<A NAME="442"></A>the assistance of many allies, notably the Thebans and Lygdamis of Naxos, 
<A NAME="443"></A>and also the Knights who held the supreme power in the constitution of 
<A NAME="444"></A>Eretria. After his victory in the battle at Pallene he captured Athens, 
<A NAME="445"></A>and when he had disarmed the people he at last had his tyranny securely 
<A NAME="446"></A>established, and was able to take Naxos and set up Lygdamis as ruler there. 
<A NAME="447"></A>He effected the disarmament of the people in the following manner. He ordered 
<A NAME="448"></A>a parade in full armour in the Theseum, and began to make a speech to the 
<A NAME="449"></A>people. He spoke for a short time, until the people called out that they 
<A NAME="450"></A>could not hear him, whereupon he bade them come up to the entrance of the 
<A NAME="451"></A>Acropolis, in order that his voice might be better heard. Then, while he 
<A NAME="452"></A>continued to speak to them at great length, men whom he had appointed for 
<A NAME="453"></A>the purpose collected the arms and locked them up in the chambers of the 
<A NAME="454"></A>Theseum hard by, and came and made a signal to him that it was done. Pisistratus 
<A NAME="455"></A>accordingly, when he had finished the rest of what he had to say, told 
<A NAME="456"></A>the people also what had happened to their arms; adding that they were 
<A NAME="457"></A>not to be surprised or alarmed, but go home and attend to their private 
<A NAME="458"></A>affairs, while he would himself for the future manage all the business 
<A NAME="459"></A>of the state.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="460"></A><B>Part 16</B>

<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>Such was the origin and such the vicissitudes of the tyranny of 
<A NAME="462"></A>Pisistratus. His administration was temperate, as has been said before, 
<A NAME="463"></A>and more like constitutional government than a tyranny. Not only was he 
<A NAME="464"></A>in every respect humane and mild and ready to forgive those who offended, 
<A NAME="465"></A>but, in addition, he advanced money to the poorer people to help them in 
<A NAME="466"></A>their labours, so that they might make their living by agriculture. In 
<A NAME="467"></A>this he had two objects, first that they might not spend their time in 
<A NAME="468"></A>the city but might be scattered over all the face of the country, and secondly 
<A NAME="469"></A>that, being moderately well off and occupied with their own business, they 
<A NAME="470"></A>might have neither the wish nor the time to attend to public affairs. At 
<A NAME="471"></A>the same time his revenues were increased by the thorough cultivation of 
<A NAME="472"></A>the country, since he imposed a tax of one tenth on all the produce. For 
<A NAME="473"></A>the same reasons he instituted the local justices,' and often made expeditions 
<A NAME="474"></A>in person into the country to inspect it and to settle disputes between 
<A NAME="475"></A>individuals, that they might not come into the city and neglect their farms. 
<A NAME="476"></A>It was in one of these progresses that, as the story goes, Pisistratus 
<A NAME="477"></A>had his adventure with the man of Hymettus, who was cultivating the spot 
<A NAME="478"></A>afterwards known as 'Tax-free Farm'. He saw a man digging and working at 
<A NAME="479"></A>a very stony piece of ground, and being surprised he sent his attendant 
<A NAME="480"></A>to ask what he got out of this plot of land. 'Aches and pains', said the 
<A NAME="481"></A>man; 'and that's what Pisistratus ought to have his tenth of'. The man 
<A NAME="482"></A>spoke without knowing who his questioner was; but Pisistratus was so leased 
<A NAME="483"></A>with his frank speech and his industry that he granted him exemption from 
<A NAME="484"></A>all taxes. And so in matters in general he burdened the people as little 
<A NAME="485"></A>as possible with his government, but always cultivated peace and kept them 
<A NAME="486"></A>in all quietness. Hence the tyranny of Pisistratus was often spoken of 
<A NAME="487"></A>proverbially as 'the age of gold'; for when his sons succeeded him the 
<A NAME="488"></A>government became much harsher. But most important of all in this respect 
<A NAME="489"></A>was his popular and kindly disposition. In all things he was accustomed 
<A NAME="490"></A>to observe the laws, without giving himself any exceptional privileges. 
<A NAME="491"></A>Once he was summoned on a charge of homicide before the Areopagus, and 
<A NAME="492"></A>he appeared in person to make his defence; but the prosecutor was afraid 
<A NAME="493"></A>to present himself and abandoned the case. For these reasons he held power 
<A NAME="494"></A>long, and whenever he was expelled he regained his position easily. The 
<A NAME="495"></A>majority alike of the upper class and of the people were in his favour; 
<A NAME="496"></A>the former he won by his social intercourse with them, the latter by the 
<A NAME="497"></A>assistance which he gave to their private purses, and his nature fitted 
<A NAME="498"></A>him to win the hearts of both. Moreover, the laws in reference to tyrants 
<A NAME="499"></A>at that time in force at Athens were very mild, especially the one which 
<A NAME="500"></A>applies more particularly to the establishment of a tyranny. The law ran 
<A NAME="501"></A>as follows: 'These are the ancestral statutes of the Athenians; if any 
<A NAME="502"></A>persons shall make an attempt to establish a tyranny, or if any person 
<A NAME="503"></A>shall join in setting up a tyranny, he shall lose his civic rights, both 
<A NAME="504"></A>himself and his whole house.'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="505"></A><B>Part 17</B>

<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>Thus did Pisistratus grow old in the possession of power, and he 
<A NAME="507"></A>died a natural death in the archonship of Philoneos, three and thirty years 
<A NAME="508"></A>from the time at which he first established himself as tyrant, during nineteen 
<A NAME="509"></A>of which he was in possession of power; the rest he spent in exile. It 
<A NAME="510"></A>is evident from this that the story is mere gossip which states that Pisistratus 
<A NAME="511"></A>was the youthful favourite of Solon and commanded in the war against Megara 
<A NAME="512"></A>for the recovery of Salamis. It will not harmonize with their respective 
<A NAME="513"></A>ages, as any one may see who will reckon up the years of the life of each 
<A NAME="514"></A>of them, and the dates at which they died. After the death of Pisistratus 
<A NAME="515"></A>his sons took up the government, and conducted it on the same system. He 
<A NAME="516"></A>had two sons by his first and legitimate wife, Hippias and Hipparchus, 
<A NAME="517"></A>and two by his Argive consort, Iophon and Hegesistratus, who was surnamed 
<A NAME="518"></A>Thessalus. For Pisistratus took a wife from Argos, Timonassa, the daughter 
<A NAME="519"></A>of a man of Argos, named Gorgilus; she had previously been the wife of 
<A NAME="520"></A>Archinus of Ambracia, one of the descendants of Cypselus. This was the 
<A NAME="521"></A>origin of his friendship with the Argives, on account of which a thousand 
<A NAME="522"></A>of them were brought over by Hegesistratus and fought on his side in the 
<A NAME="523"></A>battle at Pallene. Some authorities say that this marriage took place after 
<A NAME="524"></A>his first expulsion from Athens, others while he was in possession of the 
<A NAME="525"></A>government.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="526"></A><B>Part 18</B>

<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>Hippias and Hipparchus assumed the control of affairs on grounds 
<A NAME="528"></A>alike of standing and of age; but Hippias, as being also naturally of a 
<A NAME="529"></A>statesmanlike and shrewd disposition, was really the head of the government. 
<A NAME="530"></A>Hipparchus was youthful in disposition, amorous, and fond of literature 
<A NAME="531"></A>(it was he who invited to Athens Anacreon, Simonides, and the other poets), 
<A NAME="532"></A>while Thessalus was much junior in age, and was violent and headstrong 
<A NAME="533"></A>in his behaviour. It was from his character that all the evils arose which 
<A NAME="534"></A>befell the house. He became enamoured of Harmodius, and, since he failed 
<A NAME="535"></A>to win his affection, he lost all restraint upon his passion, and in addition 
<A NAME="536"></A>to other exhibitions of rage he finally prevented the sister of Harmodius 
<A NAME="537"></A>from taking the part of a basket-bearer in the Panathenaic procession, 
<A NAME="538"></A>alleging as his reason that Harmodius was a person of loose life. Thereupon, 
<A NAME="539"></A>in a frenzy of wrath, Harmodius and Aristogeiton did their celebrated deed, 
<A NAME="540"></A>in conjunction with a number of confederates. But while they were lying 
<A NAME="541"></A>in wait for Hippias in the Acropolis at the time of the Panathenaea (Hippias, 
<A NAME="542"></A>at this moment, was awaiting the arrival of the procession, while Hipparchus 
<A NAME="543"></A>was organizing its dispatch) they saw one of the persons privy to the plot 
<A NAME="544"></A>talking familiarly with him. Thinking that he was betraying them, and desiring 
<A NAME="545"></A>to do something before they were arrested, they rushed down and made their 
<A NAME="546"></A>attempt without waiting for the rest of their confederates. They succeeded 
<A NAME="547"></A>in killing Hipparchus near the Leocoreum while he was engaged in arranging 
<A NAME="548"></A>the procession, but ruined the design as a whole; of the two leaders, Harmodius 
<A NAME="549"></A>was killed on the spot by the guards, while Aristogeiton was arrested, 
<A NAME="550"></A>and perished later after suffering long tortures. While under the torture 
<A NAME="551"></A>he accused many persons who belonged by birth to the most distinguished 
<A NAME="552"></A>families and were also personal friends of the tyrants. At first the government 
<A NAME="553"></A>could find no clue to the conspiracy; for the current story, that Hippias 
<A NAME="554"></A>made all who were taking part in the procession leave their arms, and then 
<A NAME="555"></A>detected those who were carrying secret daggers, cannot be true, since 
<A NAME="556"></A>at that time they did not bear arms in the processions, this being a custom 
<A NAME="557"></A>instituted at a later period by the democracy. According to the story of 
<A NAME="558"></A>the popular party, Aristogeiton accused the friends of the tyrants with 
<A NAME="559"></A>the deliberate intention that the latter might commit an impious act, and 
<A NAME="560"></A>at the same time weaken themselves, by putting to death innocent men who 
<A NAME="561"></A>were their own friends; others say that he told no falsehood, but was betraying 
<A NAME="562"></A>the actual accomplices. At last, when for all his efforts he could not 
<A NAME="563"></A>obtain release by death, he promised to give further information against 
<A NAME="564"></A>a number of other persons; and, having induced Hippias to give him his 
<A NAME="565"></A>hand to confirm his word, as soon as he had hold of it he reviled him for 
<A NAME="566"></A>giving his hand to the murderer of his brother, till Hippias, in a frenzy 
<A NAME="567"></A>of rage, lost control of himself and snatched out his dagger and dispatched 
<A NAME="568"></A>him.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="569"></A><B>Part 19</B>

<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR>After this event the tyranny became much harsher. In consequence 
<A NAME="571"></A>of his vengeance for his brother, and of the execution and banishment of 
<A NAME="572"></A>a large number of persons, Hippias became a distrusted and an embittered 
<A NAME="573"></A>man. About three years after the death of Hipparchus, finding his position 
<A NAME="574"></A>in the city insecure, he set about fortifying Munichia, with the intention 
<A NAME="575"></A>of establishing himself there. While he was still engaged on this work, 
<A NAME="576"></A>however, he was expelled by Cleomenes, king of Lacedaemon, in consequence 
<A NAME="577"></A>of the Spartans being continually incited by oracles to overthrow the tyranny. 
<A NAME="578"></A>These oracles were obtained in the following way. The Athenian exiles, 
<A NAME="579"></A>headed by the Alcmeonidae, could not by their own power effect their return, 
<A NAME="580"></A>but failed continually in their attempts. Among their other failures, they 
<A NAME="581"></A>fortified a post in Attica, Lipsydrium, above Mt. Parnes, and were there 
<A NAME="582"></A>joined by some partisans from the city; but they were besieged by the tyrants 
<A NAME="583"></A>and reduced to surrender. After this disaster the following became a popular 
<A NAME="584"></A>drinking song:
<A NAME="585"></A><BR><BR>Ah! Lipsydrium, faithless friend!
<A NAME="586"></A><BR>Lo, what heroes to death didst send,
<A NAME="587"></A><BR>Nobly born and great in deed!
<A NAME="588"></A><BR>Well did they prove themselves at need
<A NAME="589"></A><BR>Of noble sires a noble seed.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>Having failed, then, in very other method, they took the contract 
<A NAME="591"></A>for rebuilding the temple at Delphi, thereby obtaining ample funds, which 
<A NAME="592"></A>they employed to secure the help of the Lacedaemonians. All this time the 
<A NAME="593"></A>Pythia kept continually enjoining on the Lacedaemonians who came to consult 
<A NAME="594"></A>the oracle, that they must free Athens; till finally she succeeded in impelling 
<A NAME="595"></A>the Spartans to that step, although the house of Pisistratus was connected 
<A NAME="596"></A>with them by ties of hospitality. The resolution of the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="597"></A>was, however, at least equally due to the friendship which had been formed 
<A NAME="598"></A>between the house of Pisistratus and Argos. Accordingly they first sent 
<A NAME="599"></A>Anchimolus by sea at the head of an army; but he was defeated and killed, 
<A NAME="600"></A>through the arrival of Cineas of Thessaly to support the sons of Pisistratus 
<A NAME="601"></A>with a force of a thousand horsemen. Then, being roused to anger by this 
<A NAME="602"></A>disaster, they sent their king, Cleomenes, by land at the head of a larger 
<A NAME="603"></A>force; and he, after defeating the Thessalian cavalry when they attempted 
<A NAME="604"></A>to intercept his march into Attica, shut up Hippias within what was known 
<A NAME="605"></A>as the Pelargic wall and blockaded him there with the assistance of the 
<A NAME="606"></A>Athenians. While he was sitting down before the place, it so happened that 
<A NAME="607"></A>the sons of the Pisistratidae were captured in an attempt to slip out; 
<A NAME="608"></A>upon which the tyrants capitulated on condition of the safety of their 
<A NAME="609"></A>children, and surrendered the Acropolis to the Athenians, five days being 
<A NAME="610"></A>first allowed them to remove their effects. This took place in the archonship 
<A NAME="611"></A>of Harpactides, after they had held the tyranny for about seventeen years 
<A NAME="612"></A>since their father's death, or in all, including the period of their father's 
<A NAME="613"></A>rule, for nine-and-forty years.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="614"></A><B>Part 20</B>

<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>After the overthrow of the tyranny, the rival leaders in the state 
<A NAME="616"></A>were Isagoras son of Tisander, a partisan of the tyrants, and Cleisthenes, 
<A NAME="617"></A>who belonged to the family of the Alcmeonidae. Cleisthenes, being beaten 
<A NAME="618"></A>in the political clubs, called in the people by giving the franchise to 
<A NAME="619"></A>the masses. Thereupon Isagoras, finding himself left inferior in power, 
<A NAME="620"></A>invited Cleomenes, who was united to him by ties of hospitality, to return 
<A NAME="621"></A>to Athens, and persuaded him to 'drive out the pollution', a plea derived 
<A NAME="622"></A>from the fact that the Alcmeonidae were suppposed to be under the curse 
<A NAME="623"></A>of pollution. On this Cleisthenes retired from the country, and Cleomenes, 
<A NAME="624"></A>entering Attica with a small force, expelled, as polluted, seven hundred 
<A NAME="625"></A>Athenian families. Having effected this, he next attempted to dissolve 
<A NAME="626"></A>the Council, and to set up Isagoras and three hundred of his partisans 
<A NAME="627"></A>as the supreme power in the state. The Council, however, resisted, the 
<A NAME="628"></A>populace flocked together, and Cleomenes and Isagoras, with their adherents, 
<A NAME="629"></A>took refuge in the Acropolis. Here the people sat down and besieged them 
<A NAME="630"></A>for two days; and on the third they agreed to let Cleomenes and all his 
<A NAME="631"></A>followers de art, while they summoned Cleisthenes and the other exiles 
<A NAME="632"></A>back to Athens. When the people had thus obtained the command of affairs, 
<A NAME="633"></A>Cleisthenes was their chief and popular leader. And this was natural; for 
<A NAME="634"></A>the Alcmeonidae were perhaps the chief cause of the expulsion of the tyrants, 
<A NAME="635"></A>and for the greater part of their rule were at perpetual war with them. 
<A NAME="636"></A>But even earlier than the attempts of the Alcmeonidae, one Cedon made an 
<A NAME="637"></A>attack on the tyrants; when there came another popular drinking song, addressed 
<A NAME="638"></A>to him:
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>Pour a health yet again, boy, to Cedon; forget not this duty to 
<A NAME="640"></A>do,
<A NAME="641"></A><BR>If a health is an honour befitting the name of a good man and 
<A NAME="642"></A>true.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="643"></A><B>Part 21</B>

<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>The people, therefore, had good reason to place confidence in Cleisthenes. 
<A NAME="645"></A>Accordingly, now that he was the popular leader, three years after the 
<A NAME="646"></A>expulsion of the tyrants, in the archonship of Isagoras, his first step 
<A NAME="647"></A>was to distribute the whole population into ten tribes in place of the 
<A NAME="648"></A>existing four, with the object of intermixing the members of the different 
<A NAME="649"></A>tribes, and so securing that more persons might have a share in the franchise. 
<A NAME="650"></A>From this arose the saying 'Do not look at the tribes', addressed to those 
<A NAME="651"></A>who wished to scrutinize the lists of the old families. Next he made the 
<A NAME="652"></A>Council to consist of five hundred members instead of four hundred, each 
<A NAME="653"></A>tribe now contributing fifty, whereas formerly each had sent a hundred. 
<A NAME="654"></A>The reason why he did not organize the people into twelve tribes was that 
<A NAME="655"></A>he might not have to use the existing division into trittyes; for the four 
<A NAME="656"></A>tribes had twelve trittyes, so that he would not have achieved his object 
<A NAME="657"></A>of redistributing the population in fresh combinations. Further, he divided 
<A NAME="658"></A>the country into thirty groups of demes, ten from the districts about the 
<A NAME="659"></A>city, ten from the coast, and ten from the interior. These he called trittyes; 
<A NAME="660"></A>and he assigned three of them by lot to each tribe, in such a way that 
<A NAME="661"></A>each should have one portion in each of these three localities. All who 
<A NAME="662"></A>lived in any given deme he declared fellow-demesmen, to the end that the 
<A NAME="663"></A>new citizens might not be exposed by the habitual use of family names, 
<A NAME="664"></A>but that men might be officially described by the names of their demes; 
<A NAME="665"></A>and accordingly it is by the names of their demes that the Athenians speak 
<A NAME="666"></A>of one another. He also instituted Demarchs, who had the same duties as 
<A NAME="667"></A>the previously existing Naucrari,-the demes being made to take the place 
<A NAME="668"></A>of the naucraries. He gave names to the demes, some from the localities 
<A NAME="669"></A>to which they belonged, some from the persons who founded them, since some 
<A NAME="670"></A>of the areas no longer corresponded to localities possessing names. On 
<A NAME="671"></A>the other hand he allowed every one to retain his family and clan and religious 
<A NAME="672"></A>rites according to ancestral custom. The names given to the tribes were 
<A NAME="673"></A>the ten which the Pythia appointed out of the hundred selected national 
<A NAME="674"></A>heroes.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="675"></A><B>Part 22</B>

<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR>By these reforms the constitution became much more democratic than 
<A NAME="677"></A>that of Solon. The laws of Solon had been obliterated by disuse during 
<A NAME="678"></A>the period of the tyranny, while Cleisthenes substituted new ones with 
<A NAME="679"></A>the object of securing the goodwill of the masses. Among these was the 
<A NAME="680"></A>law concerning ostracism. Four year after the establishment of this system, 
<A NAME="681"></A>in the archonship of Hermocreon, they first imposed upon the Council of 
<A NAME="682"></A>Five Hundred the oath which they take to the present day. Next they began 
<A NAME="683"></A>to elect the generals by tribes, one from each tribe, while the Polemarch 
<A NAME="684"></A>was the commander of the whole army. Then, eleven years later, in the archonship 
<A NAME="685"></A>of Phaenippus they won the battle of Marathon; and two years after this 
<A NAME="686"></A>victory, when the people had now gained self-confidence, they for the first 
<A NAME="687"></A>time made use of the law of ostracism. This had originally been passed 
<A NAME="688"></A>as a precaution against men in high office, because Pisistratus took advantage 
<A NAME="689"></A>of his position as a popular leader and general to make himself tyrant; 
<A NAME="690"></A>and the first person ostracized was one of his relatives, Hipparchus son 
<A NAME="691"></A>of Charmus, of the deme of Collytus, the very person on whose account especially 
<A NAME="692"></A>Cleisthenes had enacted the law, as he wished to get rid of him. Hitherto, 
<A NAME="693"></A>however, he had escaped; for the Athenians, with the usual leniency of 
<A NAME="694"></A>the democracy, allowed all the partisans of the tyrants, who had not joined 
<A NAME="695"></A>in their evil deeds in the time of the troubles to remain in the city; 
<A NAME="696"></A>and the chief and leader of these was Hipparchus. Then in the very next 
<A NAME="697"></A>year, in the archonship of Telesinus, they for the first time since the 
<A NAME="698"></A>tyranny elected, tribe by tribe, the nine Archons by lot out of the five 
<A NAME="699"></A>hundred candidates selected by the demes, all the earlier ones having been 
<A NAME="700"></A>elected by vote; and in the same year Megacles son of Hippocrates, of the 
<A NAME="701"></A>deme of Alopece, was ostracized. Thus for three years they continued to 
<A NAME="702"></A>ostracize the friends of the tyrants, on whose account the law had been 
<A NAME="703"></A>passed; but in the following year they began to remove others as well, 
<A NAME="704"></A>including any one who seemed to be more powerful than was expedient. The 
<A NAME="705"></A>first person unconnected with the tyrants who was ostracized was Xanthippus 
<A NAME="706"></A>son of Ariphron. Two years later, in the archonship of Nicodemus, the mines 
<A NAME="707"></A>of Maroneia were discovered, and the state made a profit of a hundred talents 
<A NAME="708"></A>from the working of them. Some persons advised the people to make a distribution 
<A NAME="709"></A>of the money among themselves, but this was prevented by Themistocles. 
<A NAME="710"></A>He refused to say on what he proposed to spend the money, but he bade them 
<A NAME="711"></A>lend it to the hundred richest men in Athens, one talent to each, and then, 
<A NAME="712"></A>if the manner in which it was employed pleased the people, the expenditure 
<A NAME="713"></A>should be charged to the state, but otherwise the state should receive 
<A NAME="714"></A>the sum back from those to whom it was lent. On these terms he received 
<A NAME="715"></A>the money and with it he had a hundred triremes built, each of the hundred 
<A NAME="716"></A>individuals building one; and it was with these ships that they fought 
<A NAME="717"></A>the battle of Salamis against the barbarians. About this time Aristides 
<A NAME="718"></A>the son of Lysimachus was ostracized. Three years later, however, in the 
<A NAME="719"></A>archonship of Hypsichides, all the ostracized persons were recalled, on 
<A NAME="720"></A>account of the advance of the army of Xerxes; and it was laid down for 
<A NAME="721"></A>the future that persons under sentence of ostracism must live between Geraestus 
<A NAME="722"></A>and Scyllaeum, on pain of losing their civic rights 
<A NAME="723"></A>irrevocably.
