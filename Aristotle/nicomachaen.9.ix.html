<A NAME="10"></A>1
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>In all friendships between dissimilars it is, as we have said, 
<A NAME="12"></A>proportion that equalizes the parties and preserves the friendship; e.g. 
<A NAME="13"></A>in the political form of friendship the shoemaker gets a return for his 
<A NAME="14"></A>shoes in proportion to his worth, and the weaver and all other craftsmen 
<A NAME="15"></A>do the same. Now here a common measure has been provided in the form of 
<A NAME="16"></A>money, and therefore everything is referred to this and measured by this; 
<A NAME="17"></A>but in the friendship of lovers sometimes the lover complains that his 
<A NAME="18"></A>excess of love is not met by love in return though perhaps there is nothing 
<A NAME="19"></A>lovable about him), while often the beloved complains that the lover who 
<A NAME="20"></A>formerly promised everything now performs nothing. Such incidents happen 
<A NAME="21"></A>when the lover loves the beloved for the sake of pleasure while the beloved 
<A NAME="22"></A>loves the lover for the sake of utility, and they do not both possess the 
<A NAME="23"></A>qualities expected of them. If these be the objects of the friendship it 
<A NAME="24"></A>is dissolved when they do not get the things that formed the motives of 
<A NAME="25"></A>their love; for each did not love the other person himself but the qualities 
<A NAME="26"></A>he had, and these were not enduring; that is why the friendships also are 
<A NAME="27"></A>transient. But the love of characters, as has been said, endures because 
<A NAME="28"></A>it is self-dependent. Differences arise when what they get is something 
<A NAME="29"></A>different and not what they desire; for it is like getting nothing at all 
<A NAME="30"></A>when we do not get what we aim at; compare the story of the person who 
<A NAME="31"></A>made promises to a lyre-player, promising him the more, the better he sang, 
<A NAME="32"></A>but in the morning, when the other demanded the fulfilment of his promises, 
<A NAME="33"></A>said that he had given pleasure for pleasure. Now if this had been what 
<A NAME="34"></A>each wanted, all would have been well; but if the one wanted enjoyment 
<A NAME="35"></A>but the other gain, and the one has what he wants while the other has not, 
<A NAME="36"></A>the terms of the association will not have been properly fulfilled; for 
<A NAME="37"></A>what each in fact wants is what he attends to, and it is for the sake of 
<A NAME="38"></A>that that that he will give what he has.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>But who is to fix the worth of the service; he who makes the sacrifice 
<A NAME="40"></A>or he who has got the advantage? At any rate the other seems to leave it 
<A NAME="41"></A>to him. This is what they say Protagoras used to do; whenever he taught 
<A NAME="42"></A>anything whatsoever, he bade the learner assess the value of the knowledge, 
<A NAME="43"></A>and accepted the amount so fixed. But in such matters some men approve 
<A NAME="44"></A>of the saying 'let a man have his fixed reward'. Those who get the money 
<A NAME="45"></A>first and then do none of the things they said they would, owing to the 
<A NAME="46"></A>extravagance of their promises, naturally find themselves the objects of 
<A NAME="47"></A>complaint; for they do not fulfil what they agreed to. The sophists are 
<A NAME="48"></A>perhaps compelled to do this because no one would give money for the things 
<A NAME="49"></A>they do know. These people then, if they do not do what they have been 
<A NAME="50"></A>paid for, are naturally made the objects of complaint.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>But where there is no contract of service, those who give up something 
<A NAME="52"></A>for the sake of the other party cannot (as we have said) be complained 
<A NAME="53"></A>of (for that is the nature of the friendship of virtue), and the return 
<A NAME="54"></A>to them must be made on the basis of their purpose (for it is purpose that 
<A NAME="55"></A>is the characteristic thing in a friend and in virtue). And so too, it 
<A NAME="56"></A>seems, should one make a return to those with whom one has studied philosophy; 
<A NAME="57"></A>for their worth cannot be measured against money, and they can get no honour 
<A NAME="58"></A>which will balance their services, but still it is perhaps enough, as it 
<A NAME="59"></A>is with the gods and with one's parents, to give them what one 
<A NAME="60"></A>can.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>If the gift was not of this sort, but was made with a view to a 
<A NAME="62"></A>return, it is no doubt preferable that the return made should be one that 
<A NAME="63"></A>seems fair to both parties, but if this cannot be achieved, it would seem 
<A NAME="64"></A>not only necessary that the person who gets the first service should fix 
<A NAME="65"></A>the reward, but also just; for if the other gets in return the equivalent 
<A NAME="66"></A>of the advantage the beneficiary has received, or the price lie would have 
<A NAME="67"></A>paid for the pleasure, he will have got what is fair as from the 
<A NAME="68"></A>other.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>We see this happening too with things put up for sale, and in some 
<A NAME="70"></A>places there are laws providing that no actions shall arise out of voluntary 
<A NAME="71"></A>contracts, on the assumption that one should settle with a person to whom 
<A NAME="72"></A>one has given credit, in the spirit in which one bargained with him. The 
<A NAME="73"></A>law holds that it is more just that the person to whom credit was given 
<A NAME="74"></A>should fix the terms than that the person who gave credit should do so. 
<A NAME="75"></A>For most things are not assessed at the same value by those who have them 
<A NAME="76"></A>and those who want them; each class values highly what is its own and what 
<A NAME="77"></A>it is offering; yet the return is made on the terms fixed by the receiver. 
<A NAME="78"></A>But no doubt the receiver should assess a thing not at what it seems worth 
<A NAME="79"></A>when he has it, but at what he assessed it at before he had 
<A NAME="80"></A>it.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>2
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>A further problem is set by such questions as, whether one should 
<A NAME="83"></A>in all things give the preference to one's father and obey him, or whether 
<A NAME="84"></A>when one is ill one should trust a doctor, and when one has to elect a 
<A NAME="85"></A>general should elect a man of military skill; and similarly whether one 
<A NAME="86"></A>should render a service by preference to a friend or to a good man, and 
<A NAME="87"></A>should show gratitude to a benefactor or oblige a friend, if one cannot 
<A NAME="88"></A>do both.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>All such questions are hard, are they not, to decide with precision? 
<A NAME="90"></A>For they admit of many variations of all sorts in respect both of the magnitude 
<A NAME="91"></A>of the service and of its nobility necessity. But that we should not give 
<A NAME="92"></A>the preference in all things to the same person is plain enough; and we 
<A NAME="93"></A>must for the most part return benefits rather than oblige friends, as we 
<A NAME="94"></A>must pay back a loan to a creditor rather than make one to a friend. But 
<A NAME="95"></A>perhaps even this is not always true; e.g. should a man who has been ransomed 
<A NAME="96"></A>out of the hands of brigands ransom his ransomer in return, whoever he 
<A NAME="97"></A>may be (or pay him if he has not been captured but demands payment) or 
<A NAME="98"></A>should he ransom his father? It would seem that he should ransom his father 
<A NAME="99"></A>in preference even to himself. As we have said, then, generally the debt 
<A NAME="100"></A>should be paid, but if the gift is exceedingly noble or exceedingly necessary, 
<A NAME="101"></A>one should defer to these considerations. For sometimes it is not even 
<A NAME="102"></A>fair to return the equivalent of what one has received, when the one man 
<A NAME="103"></A>has done a service to one whom he knows to be good, while the other makes 
<A NAME="104"></A>a return to one whom he believes to be bad. For that matter, one should 
<A NAME="105"></A>sometimes not lend in return to one who has lent to oneself; for the one 
<A NAME="106"></A>person lent to a good man, expecting to recover his loan, while the other 
<A NAME="107"></A>has no hope of recovering from one who is believed to be bad. Therefore 
<A NAME="108"></A>if the facts really are so, the demand is not fair; and if they are not, 
<A NAME="109"></A>but people think they are, they would be held to be doing nothing strange 
<A NAME="110"></A>in refusing. As we have often pointed out, then, discussions about feelings 
<A NAME="111"></A>and actions have just as much definiteness as their 
<A NAME="112"></A>subject-matter.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>That we should not make the same return to every one, nor give 
<A NAME="114"></A>a father the preference in everything, as one does not sacrifice everything 
<A NAME="115"></A>to Zeus, is plain enough; but since we ought to render different things 
<A NAME="116"></A>to parents, brothers, comrades, and benefactors, we ought to render to 
<A NAME="117"></A>each class what is appropriate and becoming. And this is what people seem 
<A NAME="118"></A>in fact to do; to marriages they invite their kinsfolk; for these have 
<A NAME="119"></A>a part in the family and therefore in the doings that affect the family; 
<A NAME="120"></A>and at funerals also they think that kinsfolk, before all others, should 
<A NAME="121"></A>meet, for the same reason. And it would be thought that in the matter of 
<A NAME="122"></A>food we should help our parents before all others, since we owe our own 
<A NAME="123"></A>nourishment to them, and it is more honourable to help in this respect 
<A NAME="124"></A>the authors of our being even before ourselves; and honour too one should 
<A NAME="125"></A>give to one's parents as one does to the gods, but not any and every honour; 
<A NAME="126"></A>for that matter one should not give the same honour to one's father and 
<A NAME="127"></A>one's mother, nor again should one give them the honour due to a philosopher 
<A NAME="128"></A>or to a general, but the honour due to a father, or again to a mother. 
<A NAME="129"></A>To all older persons, too, one should give honour appropriate to their 
<A NAME="130"></A>age, by rising to receive them and finding seats for them and so on; while 
<A NAME="131"></A>to comrades and brothers one should allow freedom of speech and common 
<A NAME="132"></A>use of all things. To kinsmen, too, and fellow-tribesmen and fellow-citizens 
<A NAME="133"></A>and to every other class one should always try to assign what is appropriate, 
<A NAME="134"></A>and to compare the claims of each class with respect to nearness of relation 
<A NAME="135"></A>and to virtue or usefulness. The comparison is easier when the persons 
<A NAME="136"></A>belong to the same class, and more laborious when they are different. Yet 
<A NAME="137"></A>we must not on that account shrink from the task, but decide the question 
<A NAME="138"></A>as best we can.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>3
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>Another question that arises is whether friendships should or should 
<A NAME="141"></A>not be broken off when the other party does not remain the same. Perhaps 
<A NAME="142"></A>we may say that there is nothing strange in breaking off a friendship based 
<A NAME="143"></A>on utility or pleasure, when our friends no longer have these attributes. 
<A NAME="144"></A>For it was of these attributes that we were the friends; and when these 
<A NAME="145"></A>have failed it is reasonable to love no longer. But one might complain 
<A NAME="146"></A>of another if, when he loved us for our usefulness or pleasantness, he 
<A NAME="147"></A>pretended to love us for our character. For, as we said at the outset, 
<A NAME="148"></A>most differences arise between friends when they are not friends in the 
<A NAME="149"></A>spirit in which they think they are. So when a man has deceived himself 
<A NAME="150"></A>and has thought he was being loved for his character, when the other person 
<A NAME="151"></A>was doing nothing of the kind, he must blame himself; when he has been 
<A NAME="152"></A>deceived by the pretences of the other person, it is just that he should 
<A NAME="153"></A>complain against his deceiver; he will complain with more justice than 
<A NAME="154"></A>one does against people who counterfeit the currency, inasmuch as the wrongdoing 
<A NAME="155"></A>is concerned with something more valuable.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>But if one accepts another man as good, and he turns out badly 
<A NAME="157"></A>and is seen to do so, must one still love him? Surely it is impossible, 
<A NAME="158"></A>since not everything can be loved, but only what is good. What is evil 
<A NAME="159"></A>neither can nor should be loved; for it is not one's duty to be a lover 
<A NAME="160"></A>of evil, nor to become like what is bad; and we have said that like is 
<A NAME="161"></A>dear like. Must the friendship, then, be forthwith broken off? Or is this 
<A NAME="162"></A>not so in all cases, but only when one's friends are incurable in their 
<A NAME="163"></A>wickedness? If they are capable of being reformed one should rather come 
<A NAME="164"></A>to the assistance of their character or their property, inasmuch as this 
<A NAME="165"></A>is better and more characteristic of friendship. But a man who breaks off 
<A NAME="166"></A>such a friendship would seem to be doing nothing strange; for it was not 
<A NAME="167"></A>to a man of this sort that he was a friend; when his friend has changed, 
<A NAME="168"></A>therefore, and he is unable to save him, he gives him 
<A NAME="169"></A>up.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>But if one friend remained the same while the other became better 
<A NAME="171"></A>and far outstripped him in virtue, should the latter treat the former as 
<A NAME="172"></A>a friend? Surely he cannot. When the interval is great this becomes most 
<A NAME="173"></A>plain, e.g. in the case of childish friendships; if one friend remained 
<A NAME="174"></A>a child in intellect while the other became a fully developed man, how 
<A NAME="175"></A>could they be friends when they neither approved of the same things nor 
<A NAME="176"></A>delighted in and were pained by the same things? For not even with regard 
<A NAME="177"></A>to each other will their tastes agree, and without this (as we saw) they 
<A NAME="178"></A>cannot be friends; for they cannot live together. But we have discussed 
<A NAME="179"></A>these matters.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>Should he, then, behave no otherwise towards him than he would 
<A NAME="181"></A>if he had never been his friend? Surely he should keep a remembrance of 
<A NAME="182"></A>their former intimacy, and as we think we ought to oblige friends rather 
<A NAME="183"></A>than strangers, so to those who have been our friends we ought to make 
<A NAME="184"></A>some allowance for our former friendship, when the breach has not been 
<A NAME="185"></A>due to excess of wickedness.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>4
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>Friendly relations with one's neighbours, and the marks by which 
<A NAME="188"></A>friendships are defined, seem to have proceeded from a man's relations 
<A NAME="189"></A>to himself. For (1) we define a friend as one who wishes and does what 
<A NAME="190"></A>is good, or seems so, for the sake of his friend, or (2) as one who wishes 
<A NAME="191"></A>his friend to exist and live, for his sake; which mothers do to their children, 
<A NAME="192"></A>and friends do who have come into conflict. And (3) others define him as 
<A NAME="193"></A>one who lives with and (4) has the same tastes as another, or (5) one who 
<A NAME="194"></A>grieves and rejoices with his friend; and this too is found in mothers 
<A NAME="195"></A>most of all. It is by some one of these characterstics that friendship 
<A NAME="196"></A>too is defined.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>Now each of these is true of the good man's relation to himself 
<A NAME="198"></A>(and of all other men in so far as they think themselves good; virtue and 
<A NAME="199"></A>the good man seem, as has been said, to be the measure of every class of 
<A NAME="200"></A>things). For his opinions are harmonious, and he desires the same things 
<A NAME="201"></A>with all his soul; and therefore he wishes for himself what is good and 
<A NAME="202"></A>what seems so, and does it (for it is characteristic of the good man to 
<A NAME="203"></A>work out the good), and does so for his own sake (for he does it for the 
<A NAME="204"></A>sake of the intellectual element in him, which is thought to be the man 
<A NAME="205"></A>himself); and he wishes himself to live and be preserved, and especially 
<A NAME="206"></A>the element by virtue of which he thinks. For existence is good to the 
<A NAME="207"></A>virtuous man, and each man wishes himself what is good, while no one chooses 
<A NAME="208"></A>to possess the whole world if he has first to become some one else (for 
<A NAME="209"></A>that matter, even now God possesses the good); he wishes for this only 
<A NAME="210"></A>on condition of being whatever he is; and the element that thinks would 
<A NAME="211"></A>seem to be the individual man, or to be so more than any other element 
<A NAME="212"></A>in him. And such a man wishes to live with himself; for he does so with 
<A NAME="213"></A>pleasure, since the memories of his past acts are delightful and his hopes 
<A NAME="214"></A>for the future are good, and therefore pleasant. His mind is well stored 
<A NAME="215"></A>too with subjects of contemplation. And he grieves and rejoices, more than 
<A NAME="216"></A>any other, with himself; for the same thing is always painful, and the 
<A NAME="217"></A>same thing always pleasant, and not one thing at one time and another at 
<A NAME="218"></A>another; he has, so to speak, nothing to repent of.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>Therefore, since each of these characteristics belongs to the good 
<A NAME="220"></A>man in relation to himself, and he is related to his friend as to himself 
<A NAME="221"></A>(for his friend is another self), friendship too is thought to be one of 
<A NAME="222"></A>these attributes, and those who have these attributes to be friends. Whether 
<A NAME="223"></A>there is or is not friendship between a man and himself is a question we 
<A NAME="224"></A>may dismiss for the present; there would seem to be friendship in so far 
<A NAME="225"></A>as he is two or more, to judge from the afore-mentioned attributes of friendship, 
<A NAME="226"></A>and from the fact that the extreme of friendship is likened to one's love 
<A NAME="227"></A>for oneself.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>But the attributes named seem to belong even to the majority of 
<A NAME="229"></A>men, poor creatures though they may be. Are we to say then that in so far 
<A NAME="230"></A>as they are satisfied with themselves and think they are good, they share 
<A NAME="231"></A>in these attributes? Certainly no one who is thoroughly bad and impious 
<A NAME="232"></A>has these attributes, or even seems to do so. They hardly belong even to 
<A NAME="233"></A>inferior people; for they are at variance with themselves, and have appetites 
<A NAME="234"></A>for some things and rational desires for others. This is true, for instance, 
<A NAME="235"></A>of incontinent people; for they choose, instead of the things they themselves 
<A NAME="236"></A>think good, things that are pleasant but hurtful; while others again, through 
<A NAME="237"></A>cowardice and laziness, shrink from doing what they think best for themselves. 
<A NAME="238"></A>And those who have done many terrible deeds and are hated for their wickedness 
<A NAME="239"></A>even shrink from life and destroy themselves. And wicked men seek for people 
<A NAME="240"></A>with whom to spend their days, and shun themselves; for they remember many 
<A NAME="241"></A>a grevious deed, and anticipate others like them, when they are by themselves, 
<A NAME="242"></A>but when they are with others they forget. And having nothing lovable in 
<A NAME="243"></A>them they have no feeling of love to themselves. Therefore also such men 
<A NAME="244"></A>do not rejoice or grieve with themselves; for their soul is rent by faction, 
<A NAME="245"></A>and one element in it by reason of its wickedness grieves when it abstains 
<A NAME="246"></A>from certain acts, while the other part is pleased, and one draws them 
<A NAME="247"></A>this way and the other that, as if they were pulling them in pieces. If 
<A NAME="248"></A>a man cannot at the same time be pained and pleased, at all events after 
<A NAME="249"></A>a short time he is pained because he was pleased, and he could have wished 
<A NAME="250"></A>that these things had not been pleasant to him; for bad men are laden with 
<A NAME="251"></A>repentance.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>Therefore the bad man does not seem to be amicably disposed even 
<A NAME="253"></A>to himself, because there is nothing in him to love; so that if to be thus 
<A NAME="254"></A>is the height of wretchedness, we should strain every nerve to avoid wickedness 
<A NAME="255"></A>and should endeavour to be good; for so and only so can one be either friendly 
<A NAME="256"></A>to oneself or a friend to another.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>5
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>Goodwill is a friendly sort of relation, but is not identical with 
<A NAME="259"></A>friendship; for one may have goodwill both towards people whom one does 
<A NAME="260"></A>not know, and without their knowing it, but not friendship. This has indeed 
<A NAME="261"></A>been said already.' But goodwill is not even friendly feeling. For it does 
<A NAME="262"></A>not involve intensity or desire, whereas these accompany friendly feeling; 
<A NAME="263"></A>and friendly feeling implies intimacy while goodwill may arise of a sudden, 
<A NAME="264"></A>as it does towards competitors in a contest; we come to feel goodwill for 
<A NAME="265"></A>them and to share in their wishes, but we would not do anything with them; 
<A NAME="266"></A>for, as we said, we feel goodwill suddenly and love them only 
<A NAME="267"></A>superficially.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>Goodwill seems, then, to be a beginning of friendship, as the pleasure 
<A NAME="269"></A>of the eye is the beginning of love. For no one loves if he has not first 
<A NAME="270"></A>been delighted by the form of the beloved, but he who delights in the form 
<A NAME="271"></A>of another does not, for all that, love him, but only does so when he also 
<A NAME="272"></A>longs for him when absent and craves for his presence; so too it is not 
<A NAME="273"></A>possible for people to be friends if they have not come to feel goodwill 
<A NAME="274"></A>for each other, but those who feel goodwill are not for all that friends; 
<A NAME="275"></A>for they only wish well to those for whom they feel goodwill, and would 
<A NAME="276"></A>not do anything with them nor take trouble for them. And so one might by 
<A NAME="277"></A>an extension of the term friendship say that goodwill is inactive friendship, 
<A NAME="278"></A>though when it is prolonged and reaches the point of intimacy it becomes 
<A NAME="279"></A>friendship-not the friendship based on utility nor that based on pleasure; 
<A NAME="280"></A>for goodwill too does not arise on those terms. The man who has received 
<A NAME="281"></A>a benefit bestows goodwill in return for what has been done to him, but 
<A NAME="282"></A>in doing so is only doing what is just; while he who wishes some one to 
<A NAME="283"></A>prosper because he hopes for enrichment through him seems to have goodwill 
<A NAME="284"></A>not to him but rather to himself, just as a man is not a friend to another 
<A NAME="285"></A>if he cherishes him for the sake of some use to be made of him. In general, 
<A NAME="286"></A>goodwill arises on account of some excellence and worth, when one man seems 
<A NAME="287"></A>to another beautiful or brave or something of the sort, as we pointed out 
<A NAME="288"></A>in the case of competitors in a contest.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>6
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>Unanimity also seems to be a friendly relation. For this reason 
<A NAME="291"></A>it is not identity of opinion; for that might occur even with people who 
<A NAME="292"></A>do not know each other; nor do we say that people who have the same views 
<A NAME="293"></A>on any and every subject are unanimous, e.g. those who agree about the 
<A NAME="294"></A>heavenly bodies (for unanimity about these is not a friendly relation), 
<A NAME="295"></A>but we do say that a city is unanimous when men have the same opinion about 
<A NAME="296"></A>what is to their interest, and choose the same actions, and do what they 
<A NAME="297"></A>have resolved in common. It is about things to be done, therefore, that 
<A NAME="298"></A>people are said to be unanimous, and, among these, about matters of consequence 
<A NAME="299"></A>and in which it is possible for both or all parties to get what they want; 
<A NAME="300"></A>e.g. a city is unanimous when all its citizens think that the offices in 
<A NAME="301"></A>it should be elective, or that they should form an alliance with Sparta, 
<A NAME="302"></A>or that Pittacus should be their ruler-at a time when he himself was also 
<A NAME="303"></A>willing to rule. But when each of two people wishes himself to have the 
<A NAME="304"></A>thing in question, like the captains in the Phoenissae, they are in a state 
<A NAME="305"></A>of faction; for it is not unanimity when each of two parties thinks of 
<A NAME="306"></A>the same thing, whatever that may be, but only when they think of the same 
<A NAME="307"></A>thing in the same hands, e.g. when both the common people and those of 
<A NAME="308"></A>the better class wish the best men to rule; for thus and thus alone do 
<A NAME="309"></A>all get what they aim at. Unanimity seems, then, to be political friendship, 
<A NAME="310"></A>as indeed it is commonly said to be; for it is concerned with things that 
<A NAME="311"></A>are to our interest and have an influence on our life.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>Now such unanimity is found among good men; for they are unanimous 
<A NAME="313"></A>both in themselves and with one another, being, so to say, of one mind 
<A NAME="314"></A>(for the wishes of such men are constant and not at the mercy of opposing 
<A NAME="315"></A>currents like a strait of the sea), and they wish for what is just and 
<A NAME="316"></A>what is advantageous, and these are the objects of their common endeavour 
<A NAME="317"></A>as well. But bad men cannot be unanimous except to a small extent, any 
<A NAME="318"></A>more than they can be friends, since they aim at getting more than their 
<A NAME="319"></A>share of advantages, while in labour and public service they fall short 
<A NAME="320"></A>of their share; and each man wishing for advantage to himself criticizes 
<A NAME="321"></A>his neighbour and stands in his way; for if people do not watch it carefully 
<A NAME="322"></A>the common weal is soon destroyed. The result is that they are in a state 
<A NAME="323"></A>of faction, putting compulsion on each other but unwilling themselves to 
<A NAME="324"></A>do what is just.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>7
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>Benefactors are thought to love those they have benefited, more 
<A NAME="327"></A>than those who have been well treated love those that have treated them 
<A NAME="328"></A>well, and this is discussed as though it were paradoxical. Most people 
<A NAME="329"></A>think it is because the latter are in the position of debtors and the former 
<A NAME="330"></A>of creditors; and therefore as, in the case of loans, debtors wish their 
<A NAME="331"></A>creditors did not exist, while creditors actually take care of the safety 
<A NAME="332"></A>of their debtors, so it is thought that benefactors wish the objects of 
<A NAME="333"></A>their action to exist since they will then get their gratitude, while the 
<A NAME="334"></A>beneficiaries take no interest in making this return. Epicharmus would 
<A NAME="335"></A>perhaps declare that they say this because they 'look at things on their 
<A NAME="336"></A>bad side', but it is quite like human nature; for most people are forgetful, 
<A NAME="337"></A>and are more anxious to be well treated than to treat others well. But 
<A NAME="338"></A>the cause would seem to be more deeply rooted in the nature of things; 
<A NAME="339"></A>the case of those who have lent money is not even analogous. For they have 
<A NAME="340"></A>no friendly feeling to their debtors, but only a wish that they may kept 
<A NAME="341"></A>safe with a view to what is to be got from them; while those who have done 
<A NAME="342"></A>a service to others feel friendship and love for those they have served 
<A NAME="343"></A>even if these are not of any use to them and never will be. This is what 
<A NAME="344"></A>happens with craftsmen too; every man loves his own handiwork better than 
<A NAME="345"></A>he would be loved by it if it came alive; and this happens perhaps most 
<A NAME="346"></A>of all with poets; for they have an excessive love for their own poems, 
<A NAME="347"></A>doting on them as if they were their children. This is what the position 
<A NAME="348"></A>of benefactors is like; for that which they have treated well is their 
<A NAME="349"></A>handiwork, and therefore they love this more than the handiwork does its 
<A NAME="350"></A>maker. The cause of this is that existence is to all men a thing to be 
<A NAME="351"></A>chosen and loved, and that we exist by virtue of activity (i.e. by living 
<A NAME="352"></A>and acting), and that the handiwork is in a sense, the producer in activity; 
<A NAME="353"></A>he loves his handiwork, therefore, because he loves existence. And this 
<A NAME="354"></A>is rooted in the nature of things; for what he is in potentiality, his 
<A NAME="355"></A>handiwork manifests in activity.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>At the same time to the benefactor that is noble which depends 
<A NAME="357"></A>on his action, so that he delights in the object of his action, whereas 
<A NAME="358"></A>to the patient there is nothing noble in the agent, but at most something 
<A NAME="359"></A>advantageous, and this is less pleasant and lovable. What is pleasant is 
<A NAME="360"></A>the activity of the present, the hope of the future, the memory of the 
<A NAME="361"></A>past; but most pleasant is that which depends on activity, and similarly 
<A NAME="362"></A>this is most lovable. Now for a man who has made something his work remains 
<A NAME="363"></A>(for the noble is lasting), but for the person acted on the utility passes 
<A NAME="364"></A>away. And the memory of noble things is pleasant, but that of useful things 
<A NAME="365"></A>is not likely to be pleasant, or is less so; though the reverse seems true 
<A NAME="366"></A>of expectation.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR>Further, love is like activity, being loved like passivity; and 
<A NAME="368"></A>loving and its concomitants are attributes of those who are the more 
<A NAME="369"></A>active.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>Again, all men love more what they have won by labour; e.g. those 
<A NAME="371"></A>who have made their money love it more than those who have inherited it; 
<A NAME="372"></A>and to be well treated seems to involve no labour, while to treat others 
<A NAME="373"></A>well is a laborious task. These are the reasons, too, why mothers are fonder 
<A NAME="374"></A>of their children than fathers; bringing them into the world costs them 
<A NAME="375"></A>more pains, and they know better that the children are their own. This 
<A NAME="376"></A>last point, too, would seem to apply to benefactors.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>8
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>The question is also debated, whether a man should love himself 
<A NAME="379"></A>most, or some one else. People criticize those who love themselves most, 
<A NAME="380"></A>and call them self-lovers, using this as an epithet of disgrace, and a 
<A NAME="381"></A>bad man seems to do everything for his own sake, and the more so the more 
<A NAME="382"></A>wicked he is-and so men reproach him, for instance, with doing nothing 
<A NAME="383"></A>of his own accord-while the good man acts for honour's sake, and the more 
<A NAME="384"></A>so the better he is, and acts for his friend's sake, and sacrifices his 
<A NAME="385"></A>own interest.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>But the facts clash with these arguments, and this is not surprising. 
<A NAME="387"></A>For men say that one ought to love best one's best friend, and man's best 
<A NAME="388"></A>friend is one who wishes well to the object of his wish for his sake, even 
<A NAME="389"></A>if no one is to know of it; and these attributes are found most of all 
<A NAME="390"></A>in a man's attitude towards himself, and so are all the other attributes 
<A NAME="391"></A>by which a friend is defined; for, as we have said, it is from this relation 
<A NAME="392"></A>that all the characteristics of friendship have extended to our neighbours. 
<A NAME="393"></A>All the proverbs, too, agree with this, e.g. 'a single soul', and 'what 
<A NAME="394"></A>friends have is common property', and 'friendship is equality', and 'charity 
<A NAME="395"></A>begins at home'; for all these marks will be found most in a man's relation 
<A NAME="396"></A>to himself; he is his own best friend and therefore ought to love himself 
<A NAME="397"></A>best. It is therefore a reasonable question, which of the two views we 
<A NAME="398"></A>should follow; for both are plausible.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps we ought to mark off such arguments from each other and 
<A NAME="400"></A>determine how far and in what respects each view is right. Now if we grasp 
<A NAME="401"></A>the sense in which each school uses the phrase 'lover of self', the truth 
<A NAME="402"></A>may become evident. Those who use the term as one of reproach ascribe self-love 
<A NAME="403"></A>to people who assign to themselves the greater share of wealth, honours, 
<A NAME="404"></A>and bodily pleasures; for these are what most people desire, and busy themselves 
<A NAME="405"></A>about as though they were the best of all things, which is the reason, 
<A NAME="406"></A>too, why they become objects of competition. So those who are grasping 
<A NAME="407"></A>with regard to these things gratify their appetites and in general their 
<A NAME="408"></A>feelings and the irrational element of the soul; and most men are of this 
<A NAME="409"></A>nature (which is the reason why the epithet has come to be used as it is-it 
<A NAME="410"></A>takes its meaning from the prevailing type of self-love, which is a bad 
<A NAME="411"></A>one); it is just, therefore, that men who are lovers of self in this way 
<A NAME="412"></A>are reproached for being so. That it is those who give themselves the preference 
<A NAME="413"></A>in regard to objects of this sort that most people usually call lovers 
<A NAME="414"></A>of self is plain; for if a man were always anxious that he himself, above 
<A NAME="415"></A>all things, should act justly, temperately, or in accordance with any other 
<A NAME="416"></A>of the virtues, and in general were always to try to secure for himself 
<A NAME="417"></A>the honourable course, no one will call such a man a lover of self or blame 
<A NAME="418"></A>him.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>But such a man would seem more than the other a lover of self; 
<A NAME="420"></A>at all events he assigns to himself the things that are noblest and best, 
<A NAME="421"></A>and gratifies the most authoritative element in and in all things obeys 
<A NAME="422"></A>this; and just as a city or any other systematic whole is most properly 
<A NAME="423"></A>identified with the most authoritative element in it, so is a man; and 
<A NAME="424"></A>therefore the man who loves this and gratifies it is most of all a lover 
<A NAME="425"></A>of self. Besides, a man is said to have or not to have self-control according 
<A NAME="426"></A>as his reason has or has not the control, on the assumption that this is 
<A NAME="427"></A>the man himself; and the things men have done on a rational principle are 
<A NAME="428"></A>thought most properly their own acts and voluntary acts. That this is the 
<A NAME="429"></A>man himself, then, or is so more than anything else, is plain, and also 
<A NAME="430"></A>that the good man loves most this part of him. Whence it follows that he 
<A NAME="431"></A>is most truly a lover of self, of another type than that which is a matter 
<A NAME="432"></A>of reproach, and as different from that as living according to a rational 
<A NAME="433"></A>principle is from living as passion dictates, and desiring what is noble 
<A NAME="434"></A>from desiring what seems advantageous. Those, then, who busy themselves 
<A NAME="435"></A>in an exceptional degree with noble actions all men approve and praise; 
<A NAME="436"></A>and if all were to strive towards what is noble and strain every nerve 
<A NAME="437"></A>to do the noblest deeds, everything would be as it should be for the common 
<A NAME="438"></A>weal, and every one would secure for himself the goods that are greatest, 
<A NAME="439"></A>since virtue is the greatest of goods.
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>Therefore the good man should be a lover of self (for he will both 
<A NAME="441"></A>himself profit by doing noble acts, and will benefit his fellows), but 
<A NAME="442"></A>the wicked man should not; for he will hurt both himself and his neighbours, 
<A NAME="443"></A>following as he does evil passions. For the wicked man, what he does clashes 
<A NAME="444"></A>with what he ought to do, but what the good man ought to do he does; for 
<A NAME="445"></A>reason in each of its possessors chooses what is best for itself, and the 
<A NAME="446"></A>good man obeys his reason. It is true of the good man too that he does 
<A NAME="447"></A>many acts for the sake of his friends and his country, and if necessary 
<A NAME="448"></A>dies for them; for he will throw away both wealth and honours and in general 
<A NAME="449"></A>the goods that are objects of competition, gaining for himself nobility; 
<A NAME="450"></A>since he would prefer a short period of intense pleasure to a long one 
<A NAME="451"></A>of mild enjoyment, a twelvemonth of noble life to many years of humdrum 
<A NAME="452"></A>existence, and one great and noble action to many trivial ones. Now those 
<A NAME="453"></A>who die for others doubtless attain this result; it is therefore a great 
<A NAME="454"></A>prize that they choose for themselves. They will throw away wealth too 
<A NAME="455"></A>on condition that their friends will gain more; for while a man's friend 
<A NAME="456"></A>gains wealth he himself achieves nobility; he is therefore assigning the 
<A NAME="457"></A>greater good to himself. The same too is true of honour and office; all 
<A NAME="458"></A>these things he will sacrifice to his friend; for this is noble and laudable 
<A NAME="459"></A>for himself. Rightly then is he thought to be good, since he chooses nobility 
<A NAME="460"></A>before all else. But he may even give up actions to his friend; it may 
<A NAME="461"></A>be nobler to become the cause of his friend's acting than to act himself. 
<A NAME="462"></A>In all the actions, therefore, that men are praised for, the good man is 
<A NAME="463"></A>seen to assign to himself the greater share in what is noble. In this sense, 
<A NAME="464"></A>then, as has been said, a man should be a lover of self; but in the sense 
<A NAME="465"></A>in which most men are so, he ought not.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR>9
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>It is also disputed whether the happy man will need friends or 
<A NAME="468"></A>not. It is said that those who are supremely happy and self-sufficient 
<A NAME="469"></A>have no need of friends; for they have the things that are good, and therefore 
<A NAME="470"></A>being self-sufficient they need nothing further, while a friend, being 
<A NAME="471"></A>another self, furnishes what a man cannot provide by his own effort; whence 
<A NAME="472"></A>the saying 'when fortune is kind, what need of friends?' But it seems strange, 
<A NAME="473"></A>when one assigns all good things to the happy man, not to assign friends, 
<A NAME="474"></A>who are thought the greatest of external goods. And if it is more characteristic 
<A NAME="475"></A>of a friend to do well by another than to be well done by, and to confer 
<A NAME="476"></A>benefits is characteristic of the good man and of virtue, and it is nobler 
<A NAME="477"></A>to do well by friends than by strangers, the good man will need people 
<A NAME="478"></A>to do well by. This is why the question is asked whether we need friends 
<A NAME="479"></A>more in prosperity or in adversity, on the assumption that not only does 
<A NAME="480"></A>a man in adversity need people to confer benefits on him, but also those 
<A NAME="481"></A>who are prospering need people to do well by. Surely it is strange, too, 
<A NAME="482"></A>to make the supremely happy man a solitary; for no one would choose the 
<A NAME="483"></A>whole world on condition of being alone, since man is a political creature 
<A NAME="484"></A>and one whose nature is to live with others. Therefore even the happy man 
<A NAME="485"></A>lives with others; for he has the things that are by nature good. And plainly 
<A NAME="486"></A>it is better to spend his days with friends and good men than with strangers 
<A NAME="487"></A>or any chance persons. Therefore the happy man needs 
<A NAME="488"></A>friends.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR>What then is it that the first school means, and in what respect 
<A NAME="490"></A>is it right? Is it that most identify friends with useful people? Of such 
<A NAME="491"></A>friends indeed the supremely happy man will have no need, since he already 
<A NAME="492"></A>has the things that are good; nor will he need those whom one makes one's 
<A NAME="493"></A>friends because of their pleasantness, or he will need them only to a small 
<A NAME="494"></A>extent (for his life, being pleasant, has no need of adventitious pleasure); 
<A NAME="495"></A>and because he does not need such friends he is thought not to need 
<A NAME="496"></A>friends.
<A NAME="497"></A><BR><BR>But that is surely not true. For we have said at the outset that 
<A NAME="498"></A>happiness is an activity; and activity plainly comes into being and is 
<A NAME="499"></A>not present at the start like a piece of property. If (1) happiness lies 
<A NAME="500"></A>in living and being active, and the good man's activity is virtuous and 
<A NAME="501"></A>pleasant in itself, as we have said at the outset, and (2) a thing's being 
<A NAME="502"></A>one's own is one of the attributes that make it pleasant, and (3) we can 
<A NAME="503"></A>contemplate our neighbours better than ourselves and their actions better 
<A NAME="504"></A>than our own, and if the actions of virtuous men who are their friends 
<A NAME="505"></A>are pleasant to good men (since these have both the attributes that are 
<A NAME="506"></A>naturally pleasant),-if this be so, the supremely happy man will need friends 
<A NAME="507"></A>of this sort, since his purpose is to contemplate worthy actions and actions 
<A NAME="508"></A>that are his own, and the actions of a good man who is his friend have 
<A NAME="509"></A>both these qualities.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>Further, men think that the happy man ought to live pleasantly. 
<A NAME="511"></A>Now if he were a solitary, life would be hard for him; for by oneself it 
<A NAME="512"></A>is not easy to be continuously active; but with others and towards others 
<A NAME="513"></A>it is easier. With others therefore his activity will be more continuous, 
<A NAME="514"></A>and it is in itself pleasant, as it ought to be for the man who is supremely 
<A NAME="515"></A>happy; for a good man qua good delights in virtuous actions and is vexed 
<A NAME="516"></A>at vicious ones, as a musical man enjoys beautiful tunes but is pained 
<A NAME="517"></A>at bad ones. A certain training in virtue arises also from the company 
<A NAME="518"></A>of the good, as Theognis has said before us.
<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>If we look deeper into the nature of things, a virtuous friend 
<A NAME="520"></A>seems to be naturally desirable for a virtuous man. For that which is good 
<A NAME="521"></A>by nature, we have said, is for the virtuous man good and pleasant in itself. 
<A NAME="522"></A>Now life is defined in the case of animals by the power of perception in 
<A NAME="523"></A>that of man by the power of perception or thought; and a power is defined 
<A NAME="524"></A>by reference to the corresponding activity, which is the essential thing; 
<A NAME="525"></A>therefore life seems to be essentially the act of perceiving or thinking. 
<A NAME="526"></A>And life is among the things that are good and pleasant in themselves, 
<A NAME="527"></A>since it is determinate and the determinate is of the nature of the good; 
<A NAME="528"></A>and that which is good by nature is also good for the virtuous man (which 
<A NAME="529"></A>is the reason why life seems pleasant to all men); but we must not apply 
<A NAME="530"></A>this to a wicked and corrupt life nor to a life spent in pain; for such 
<A NAME="531"></A>a life is indeterminate, as are its attributes. The nature of pain will 
<A NAME="532"></A>become plainer in what follows. But if life itself is good and pleasant 
<A NAME="533"></A>(which it seems to be, from the very fact that all men desire it, and particularly 
<A NAME="534"></A>those who are good and supremely happy; for to such men life is most desirable, 
<A NAME="535"></A>and their existence is the most supremely happy) and if he who sees perceives 
<A NAME="536"></A>that he sees, and he who hears, that he hears, and he who walks, that he 
<A NAME="537"></A>walks, and in the case of all other activities similarly there is something 
<A NAME="538"></A>which perceives that we are active, so that if we perceive, we perceive 
<A NAME="539"></A>that we perceive, and if we think, that we think; and if to perceive that 
<A NAME="540"></A>we perceive or think is to perceive that we exist (for existence was defined 
<A NAME="541"></A>as perceiving or thinking); and if perceiving that one lives is in itself 
<A NAME="542"></A>one of the things that are pleasant (for life is by nature good, and to 
<A NAME="543"></A>perceive what is good present in oneself is pleasant); and if life is desirable, 
<A NAME="544"></A>and particularly so for good men, because to them existence is good and 
<A NAME="545"></A>pleasant for they are pleased at the consciousness of the presence in them 
<A NAME="546"></A>of what is in itself good); and if as the virtuous man is to himself, he 
<A NAME="547"></A>is to his friend also (for his friend is another self):-if all this be 
<A NAME="548"></A>true, as his own being is desirable for each man, so, or almost so, is 
<A NAME="549"></A>that of his friend. Now his being was seen to be desirable because he perceived 
<A NAME="550"></A>his own goodness, and such perception is pleasant in itself. He needs, 
<A NAME="551"></A>therefore, to be conscious of the existence of his friend as well, and 
<A NAME="552"></A>this will be realized in their living together and sharing in discussion 
<A NAME="553"></A>and thought; for this is what living together would seem to mean in the 
<A NAME="554"></A>case of man, and not, as in the case of cattle, feeding in the same 
<A NAME="555"></A>place.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>If, then, being is in itself desirable for the supremely happy 
<A NAME="557"></A>man (since it is by its nature good and pleasant), and that of his friend 
<A NAME="558"></A>is very much the same, a friend will be one of the things that are desirable. 
<A NAME="559"></A>Now that which is desirable for him he must have, or he will be deficient 
<A NAME="560"></A>in this respect. The man who is to be happy will therefore need virtuous 
<A NAME="561"></A>friends.
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><BR>10
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>Should we, then, make as many friends as possible, or-as in the 
<A NAME="564"></A>case of hospitality it is thought to be suitable advice, that one should 
<A NAME="565"></A>be 'neither a man of many guests nor a man with none'-will that apply to 
<A NAME="566"></A>friendship as well; should a man neither be friendless nor have an excessive 
<A NAME="567"></A>number of friends?
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>To friends made with a view to utility this saying would seem thoroughly 
<A NAME="569"></A>applicable; for to do services to many people in return is a laborious 
<A NAME="570"></A>task and life is not long enough for its performance. Therefore friends 
<A NAME="571"></A>in excess of those who are sufficient for our own life are superfluous, 
<A NAME="572"></A>and hindrances to the noble life; so that we have no need of them. Of friends 
<A NAME="573"></A>made with a view to pleasure, also, few are enough, as a little seasoning 
<A NAME="574"></A>in food is enough.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR>But as regards good friends, should we have as many as possible, 
<A NAME="576"></A>or is there a limit to the number of one's friends, as there is to the 
<A NAME="577"></A>size of a city? You cannot make a city of ten men, and if there are a hundred 
<A NAME="578"></A>thousand it is a city no longer. But the proper number is presumably not 
<A NAME="579"></A>a single number, but anything that falls between certain fixed points. 
<A NAME="580"></A>So for friends too there is a fixed number perhaps the largest number with 
<A NAME="581"></A>whom one can live together (for that, we found, thought to be very characteristic 
<A NAME="582"></A>of friendship); and that one cannot live with many people and divide oneself 
<A NAME="583"></A>up among them is plain. Further, they too must be friends of one another, 
<A NAME="584"></A>if they are all to spend their days together; and it is a hard business 
<A NAME="585"></A>for this condition to be fulfilled with a large number. It is found difficult, 
<A NAME="586"></A>too, to rejoice and to grieve in an intimate way with many people, for 
<A NAME="587"></A>it may likely happen that one has at once to be happy with one friend and 
<A NAME="588"></A>to mourn with another. Presumably, then, it is well not to seek to have 
<A NAME="589"></A>as many friends as possible, but as many as are enough for the purpose 
<A NAME="590"></A>of living together; for it would seem actually impossible to be a great 
<A NAME="591"></A>friend to many people. This is why one cannot love several people; love 
<A NAME="592"></A>is ideally a sort of excess of friendship, and that can only be felt towards 
<A NAME="593"></A>one person; therefore great friendship too can only be felt towards a few 
<A NAME="594"></A>people. This seems to be confirmed in practice; for we do not find many 
<A NAME="595"></A>people who are friends in the comradely way of friendship, and the famous 
<A NAME="596"></A>friendships of this sort are always between two people. Those who have 
<A NAME="597"></A>many friends and mix intimately with them all are thought to be no one's 
<A NAME="598"></A>friend, except in the way proper to fellow-citizens, and such people are 
<A NAME="599"></A>also called obsequious. In the way proper to fellow-citizens, indeed, it 
<A NAME="600"></A>is possible to be the friend of many and yet not be obsequious but a genuinely 
<A NAME="601"></A>good man; but one cannot have with many people the friendship based on 
<A NAME="602"></A>virtue and on the character of our friends themselves, and we must be content 
<A NAME="603"></A>if we find even a few such.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR>11
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>Do we need friends more in good fortune or in bad? They are sought 
<A NAME="606"></A>after in both; for while men in adversity need help, in prosperity they 
<A NAME="607"></A>need people to live with and to make the objects of their beneficence; 
<A NAME="608"></A>for they wish to do well by others. Friendship, then, is more necessary 
<A NAME="609"></A>in bad fortune, and so it is useful friends that one wants in this case; 
<A NAME="610"></A>but it is more noble in good fortune, and so we also seek for good men 
<A NAME="611"></A>as our friends, since it is more desirable to confer benefits on these 
<A NAME="612"></A>and to live with these. For the very presence of friends is pleasant both 
<A NAME="613"></A>in good fortune and also in bad, since grief is lightened when friends 
<A NAME="614"></A>sorrow with us. Hence one might ask whether they share as it were our burden, 
<A NAME="615"></A>or-without that happening-their presence by its pleasantness, and the thought 
<A NAME="616"></A>of their grieving with us, make our pain less. Whether it is for these 
<A NAME="617"></A>reasons or for some other that our grief is lightened, is a question that 
<A NAME="618"></A>may be dismissed; at all events what we have described appears to take 
<A NAME="619"></A>place.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>But their presence seems to contain a mixture of various factors. 
<A NAME="621"></A>The very seeing of one's friends is pleasant, especially if one is in adversity, 
<A NAME="622"></A>and becomes a safeguard against grief (for a friend tends to comfort us 
<A NAME="623"></A>both by the sight of him and by his words, if he is tactful, since he knows 
<A NAME="624"></A>our character and the things that please or pain us); but to see him pained 
<A NAME="625"></A>at our misfortunes is painful; for every one shuns being a cause of pain 
<A NAME="626"></A>to his friends. For this reason people of a manly nature guard against 
<A NAME="627"></A>making their friends grieve with them, and, unless he be exceptionally 
<A NAME="628"></A>insensible to pain, such a man cannot stand the pain that ensues for his 
<A NAME="629"></A>friends, and in general does not admit fellow-mourners because he is not 
<A NAME="630"></A>himself given to mourning; but women and womanly men enjoy sympathisers 
<A NAME="631"></A>in their grief, and love them as friends and companions in sorrow. But 
<A NAME="632"></A>in all things one obviously ought to imitate the better type of 
<A NAME="633"></A>person.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR>On the other hand, the presence of friends in our prosperity implies 
<A NAME="635"></A>both a pleasant passing of our time and the pleasant thought of their pleasure 
<A NAME="636"></A>at our own good fortune. For this cause it would seem that we ought to 
<A NAME="637"></A>summon our friends readily to share our good fortunes (for the beneficent 
<A NAME="638"></A>character is a noble one), but summon them to our bad fortunes with hesitation; 
<A NAME="639"></A>for we ought to give them as little a share as possible in our evils whence 
<A NAME="640"></A>the saying 'enough is my misfortune'. We should summon friends to us most 
<A NAME="641"></A>of all when they are likely by suffering a few inconveniences to do us 
<A NAME="642"></A>a great service.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR>Conversely, it is fitting to go unasked and readily to the aid 
<A NAME="644"></A>of those in adversity (for it is characteristic of a friend to render services, 
<A NAME="645"></A>and especially to those who are in need and have not demanded them; such 
<A NAME="646"></A>action is nobler and pleasanter for both persons); but when our friends 
<A NAME="647"></A>are prosperous we should join readily in their activities (for they need 
<A NAME="648"></A>friends for these too), but be tardy in coming forward to be the objects 
<A NAME="649"></A>of their kindness; for it is not noble to be keen to receive benefits. 
<A NAME="650"></A>Still, we must no doubt avoid getting the reputation of kill-joys by repulsing 
<A NAME="651"></A>them; for that sometimes happens.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>The presence of friends, then, seems desirable in all 
<A NAME="653"></A>circumstances.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR>12
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>Does it not follow, then, that, as for lovers the sight of the 
<A NAME="656"></A>beloved is the thing they love most, and they prefer this sense to the 
<A NAME="657"></A>others because on it love depends most for its being and for its origin, 
<A NAME="658"></A>so for friends the most desirable thing is living together? For friendship 
<A NAME="659"></A>is a partnership, and as a man is to himself, so is he to his friend; now 
<A NAME="660"></A>in his own case the consciousness of his being is desirable, and so therefore 
<A NAME="661"></A>is the consciousness of his friend's being, and the activity of this consciousness 
<A NAME="662"></A>is produced when they live together, so that it is natural that they aim 
<A NAME="663"></A>at this. And whatever existence means for each class of men, whatever it 
<A NAME="664"></A>is for whose sake they value life, in that they wish to occupy themselves 
<A NAME="665"></A>with their friends; and so some drink together, others dice together, others 
<A NAME="666"></A>join in athletic exercises and hunting, or in the study of philosophy, 
<A NAME="667"></A>each class spending their days together in whatever they love most in life; 
<A NAME="668"></A>for since they wish to live with their friends, they do and share in those 
<A NAME="669"></A>things which give them the sense of living together. Thus the friendship 
<A NAME="670"></A>of bad men turns out an evil thing (for because of their instability they 
<A NAME="671"></A>unite in bad pursuits, and besides they become evil by becoming like each 
<A NAME="672"></A>other), while the friendship of good men is good, being augmented by their 
<A NAME="673"></A>companionship; and they are thought to become better too by their activities 
<A NAME="674"></A>and by improving each other; for from each other they take the mould of 
<A NAME="675"></A>the characteristics they approve-whence the saying 'noble deeds from noble 
<A NAME="676"></A>men'.-So much, then, for friendship; our next task must be to discuss 
<A NAME="677"></A>pleasure.
