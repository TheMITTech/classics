<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>We must now treat of youth and old age and life and death. We must probably 
<A NAME="12"></A>also at the same time state the causes of respiration as well, since in 
<A NAME="13"></A>some cases living and the reverse depend on this.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>We have elsewhere given a precise account of the soul, and while 
<A NAME="15"></A>it is clear that its essential reality cannot be corporeal, yet manifestly 
<A NAME="16"></A>it must exist in some bodily part which must be one of those possessing 
<A NAME="17"></A>control over the members. Let us for the present set aside the other divisions 
<A NAME="18"></A>or faculties of the soul (whichever of the two be the correct name). But 
<A NAME="19"></A>as to being what is called an animal and a living thing, we find that in 
<A NAME="20"></A>all beings endowed with both characteristics (viz. being an animal and 
<A NAME="21"></A>being alive) there must be a single identical part in virtue of which they 
<A NAME="22"></A>live and are called animals; for an animal qua animal cannot avoid being 
<A NAME="23"></A>alive. But a thing need not, though alive, be animal, for plants live without 
<A NAME="24"></A>having sensation, and it is by sensation that we distinguish animal from 
<A NAME="25"></A>what is not animal.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>This organ, then, must be numerically one and the same and yet 
<A NAME="27"></A>possess multiple and disparate aspects, for being animal and living are 
<A NAME="28"></A>not identical. Since then the organs of special sensation have one common 
<A NAME="29"></A>organ in which the senses when functioning must meet, and this must be 
<A NAME="30"></A>situated midway between what is called before and behind (we call 'before' 
<A NAME="31"></A>the direction from which sensation comes, 'behind' the opposite), further, 
<A NAME="32"></A>since in all living things the body is divided into upper and lower (they 
<A NAME="33"></A>all have upper and lower parts, so that this is true of plants as well), 
<A NAME="34"></A>clearly the nutritive principle must be situated midway between these regions. 
<A NAME="35"></A>That part where food enters we call upper, considering it by itself and 
<A NAME="36"></A>not relatively to the surrounding universe, while downward is that part 
<A NAME="37"></A>by which the primary excrement is discharged.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>Plants are the reverse of animals in this respect. To man in particular 
<A NAME="39"></A>among the animals, on account of his erect stature, belongs the characteristic 
<A NAME="40"></A>of having his upper parts pointing upwards in the sense in which that applies 
<A NAME="41"></A>to the universe, while in the others these are in an intermediate position. 
<A NAME="42"></A>But in plants, owing to their being stationary and drawing their sustenance 
<A NAME="43"></A>from the ground, the upper part must always be down; for there is a correspondence 
<A NAME="44"></A>between the roots in a plant and what is called the mouth in animals, by 
<A NAME="45"></A>means of which they take in their food, whether the source of supply be 
<A NAME="46"></A>the earth or each other's bodies.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="47"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>All perfectly formed animals are to be divided into three parts, 
<A NAME="49"></A>one that by which food is taken in, one that by which excrement is discharged, 
<A NAME="50"></A>and the third the region intermediate between them. In the largest animals 
<A NAME="51"></A>this latter is called the chest and in the others something corresponding; 
<A NAME="52"></A>in some also it is more distinctly marked off than in others. All those 
<A NAME="53"></A>also that are capable of progression have additional members subservient 
<A NAME="54"></A>to this purpose, by means of which they bear the whole trunk, to wit legs 
<A NAME="55"></A>and feet and whatever parts are possessed of the same powers. Now it is 
<A NAME="56"></A>evident both by observation and by inference that the source of the nutritive 
<A NAME="57"></A>soul is in the midst of the three parts. For many animals, when either 
<A NAME="58"></A>part-the head or the receptacle of the food-is cut off, retain life in 
<A NAME="59"></A>that member to which the middle remains attached. This can be seen to occur 
<A NAME="60"></A>in many insects, e.g. wasps and bees, and many animals also besides insects 
<A NAME="61"></A>can, though divided, continue to live by means of the part connected with 
<A NAME="62"></A>nutrition.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>While this member is indeed in actuality single, yet potentially 
<A NAME="64"></A>it is multiple, for these animals have a constitution similar to that of 
<A NAME="65"></A>Plants; plants when cut into sections continue to live, and a number of 
<A NAME="66"></A>trees can be derived from one single source. A separate account will be 
<A NAME="67"></A>given of the reason why some plants cannot live when divided, while others 
<A NAME="68"></A>can be propagated by the taking of slips. In this respect, however, plants 
<A NAME="69"></A>and insects are alike.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>It is true that the nutritive soul, in beings possessing it, while 
<A NAME="71"></A>actually single must be potentially plural. And it is too with the principle 
<A NAME="72"></A>of sensation, for evidently the divided segments of these animals have 
<A NAME="73"></A>sensation. They are unable, however, to preserve their constitution, as 
<A NAME="74"></A>plants can, not possessing the organs on which the continuance of life 
<A NAME="75"></A>depends, for some lack the means for seizing, others for receiving their 
<A NAME="76"></A>food; or again they may be destitute of other organs as 
<A NAME="77"></A>well.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>Divisible animals are like a number of animals grown together, 
<A NAME="79"></A>but animals of superior construction behave differently because their constitution 
<A NAME="80"></A>is a unity of the highest possible kind. Hence some of the organs on division 
<A NAME="81"></A>display slight sensitiveness because they retain some psychical susceptibility; 
<A NAME="82"></A>the animals continue to move after the vitals have been abstracted: tortoises, 
<A NAME="83"></A>for example, do so even after the heart has been removed.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="84"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>The same phenomenon is evident both in plants and in animals, and 
<A NAME="86"></A>in plants we note it both in their propagation by seed and in grafts and 
<A NAME="87"></A>cuttings. Genesis from seeds always starts from the middle. All seeds are 
<A NAME="88"></A>bivalvular, and the place of junction is situated at the point of attachment 
<A NAME="89"></A>(to the plant), an intermediate part belonging to both halves. It is from 
<A NAME="90"></A>this part that both root and stem of growing things emerge; the starting-point 
<A NAME="91"></A>is in a central position between them. In the case of grafts and cuttings 
<A NAME="92"></A>this is particularly true of the buds; for the bud is in a way the starting-point 
<A NAME="93"></A>of the branch, but at the same time it is in a central position. Hence 
<A NAME="94"></A>it is either this that is cut off, or into this that the new shoot is inserted, 
<A NAME="95"></A>when we wish either a new branch or a new root to spring from it; which 
<A NAME="96"></A>proves that the point of origin in growth is intermediate between stem 
<A NAME="97"></A>and root.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>Likewise in sanguineous animals the heart is the first organ developed; 
<A NAME="99"></A>this is evident from what has been observed in those cases where observation 
<A NAME="100"></A>of their growth is possible. Hence in bloodless animals also what corresponds 
<A NAME="101"></A>to the heart must develop first. We have already asserted in our treatise 
<A NAME="102"></A>on The Parts of Animals that it is from the heart that the veins issue, 
<A NAME="103"></A>and that in sanguineous animals the blood is the final nutriment from which 
<A NAME="104"></A>the members are formed. Hence it is clear that there is one function in 
<A NAME="105"></A>nutrition which the mouth has the faculty of performing, and a different 
<A NAME="106"></A>one appertaining to the stomach. But it is the heart that has supreme control, 
<A NAME="107"></A>exercising an additional and completing function. Hence in sanguineous 
<A NAME="108"></A>animals the source both of the sensitive and of the nutritive soul must 
<A NAME="109"></A>be in the heart, for the functions relative to nutrition exercised by the 
<A NAME="110"></A>other parts are ancillary to the activity of the heart. It is the part 
<A NAME="111"></A>of the dominating organ to achieve the final result, as of the physician's 
<A NAME="112"></A>efforts to be directed towards health, and not to be occupied with subordinate 
<A NAME="113"></A>offices.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>Certainly, however, all saguineous animals have the supreme organ 
<A NAME="115"></A>of the sensefaculties in the heart, for it is here that we must look for 
<A NAME="116"></A>the common sensorium belonging to all the sense-organs. These in two cases, 
<A NAME="117"></A>taste and touch, can be clearly seen to extend to the heart, and hence 
<A NAME="118"></A>the others also must lead to it, for in it the other organs may possibly 
<A NAME="119"></A>initiate changes, whereas with the upper region of the body taste and touch 
<A NAME="120"></A>have no connexion. Apart from these considerations, if the life is always 
<A NAME="121"></A>located in this part, evidently the principle of sensation must be situated 
<A NAME="122"></A>there too, for it is qua animal that an animal is said to be a living thing, 
<A NAME="123"></A>and it is called animal because endowed with sensation. Elsewhere in other 
<A NAME="124"></A>works we have stated the reasons why some of the sense-organs are, as is 
<A NAME="125"></A>evident, connected with the heart, while others are situated in the head. 
<A NAME="126"></A>(It is this fact that causes some people to think that it is in virtue 
<A NAME="127"></A>of the brain that the function of perception belongs to 
<A NAME="128"></A>animals.)
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="129"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>Thus if, on the one hand, we look to the observed facts, what we 
<A NAME="131"></A>have said makes it clear that the source of the sensitive soul, together 
<A NAME="132"></A>with that connected with growth and nutrition, is situated in this organ 
<A NAME="133"></A>and in the central one of the three divisions of the body. But it follows 
<A NAME="134"></A>by deduction also; for we see that in every case, when several results 
<A NAME="135"></A>are open to her, Nature always brings to pass the best. Now if both principles 
<A NAME="136"></A>are located in the midst of the substance, the two parts of the body, viz. 
<A NAME="137"></A>that which elaborates and that which receives the nutriment in its final 
<A NAME="138"></A>form will best perform their appropriate function; for the soul will then 
<A NAME="139"></A>be close to each, and the central situation which it will, as such, occupy 
<A NAME="140"></A>is the position of a dominating power.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>Further, that which employs an instrument and the instrument it 
<A NAME="142"></A>employs must be distinct (and must be spatially diverse too, if possible, 
<A NAME="143"></A>as in capacity), just as the flute and that which plays it-the hand-are 
<A NAME="144"></A>diverse. Thus if animal is defined by the possession of sensitive soul, 
<A NAME="145"></A>this soul must in the sanguineous animals be in the heart, and, in the 
<A NAME="146"></A>bloodless ones, in the corresponding part of their body. But in animals 
<A NAME="147"></A>all the members and the whole body possess some connate warmth of constitution, 
<A NAME="148"></A>and hence when alive they are observed to be warm, but when dead and deprived 
<A NAME="149"></A>of life they are the opposite. Indeed, the source of this warmth must be 
<A NAME="150"></A>in the heart in sanguineous animals, and in the case of bloodless animals 
<A NAME="151"></A>in the corresponding organ, for, though all parts of the body by means 
<A NAME="152"></A>of their natural heat elaborate and concoct the nutriment, the governing 
<A NAME="153"></A>organ takes the chief share in this process. Hence, though the other members 
<A NAME="154"></A>become cold, life remains; but when the warmth here is quenched, death 
<A NAME="155"></A>always ensues, because the source of heat in all the other members depends 
<A NAME="156"></A>on this, and the soul is, as it were, set aglow with fire in this part, 
<A NAME="157"></A>which in sanguineous animals is the heart and in the bloodless order the 
<A NAME="158"></A>analogous member. Hence, of necessity, life must be coincident with the 
<A NAME="159"></A>maintenance of heat, and what we call death is its destruction.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="160"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>However, it is to be noticed that there are two ways in which fire 
<A NAME="162"></A>ceases to exist; it may go out either by exhaustion or by extinction. That 
<A NAME="163"></A>which is self-caused we call exhaustion, that due to its opposites extinction. 
<A NAME="164"></A>[The former is that due to old age, the latter to violence.] But either 
<A NAME="165"></A>of these ways in which fire ceases to be may be brought about by the same 
<A NAME="166"></A>cause, for, when there is a deficiency of nutriment and the warmth can 
<A NAME="167"></A>obtain no maintenance, the fire fails; and the reason is that the opposite, 
<A NAME="168"></A>checking digestion, prevents the fire from being fed. But in other cases 
<A NAME="169"></A>the result is exhaustion,-when the heat accumulates excessively owing to 
<A NAME="170"></A>lack of respiration and of refrigeration. For in this case what happens 
<A NAME="171"></A>is that the heat, accumulating in great quantity, quickly uses up its nutriment 
<A NAME="172"></A>and consumes it all before more is sent up by evaporation. Hence not only 
<A NAME="173"></A>is a smaller fire readily put out by a large one, but of itself the candle 
<A NAME="174"></A>flame is consumed when inserted in a large blaze just as is the case with 
<A NAME="175"></A>any other combustible. The reason is that the nutriment in the flame is 
<A NAME="176"></A>seized by the larger one before fresh fuel can be added, for fire is ever 
<A NAME="177"></A>coming into being and rushing just like a river, but so speedily as to 
<A NAME="178"></A>elude observation.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>Clearly therefore, if the bodily heat must be conserved (as is 
<A NAME="180"></A>necessary if life is to continue), there must be some way of cooling the 
<A NAME="181"></A>heat resident in the source of warmth. Take as an illustration what occurs 
<A NAME="182"></A>when coals are confined in a brazier. If they are kept covered up continuously 
<A NAME="183"></A>by the so-called 'choker', they are quickly extinguished, but, if the lid 
<A NAME="184"></A>is in rapid alternation lifted up and put on again they remain glowing 
<A NAME="185"></A>for a long time. Banking up a fire also keeps it in, for the ashes, being 
<A NAME="186"></A>porous, do not prevent the passage of air, and again they enable it to 
<A NAME="187"></A>resist extinction by the surrounding air by means of the supply of heat 
<A NAME="188"></A>which it possesses. However, we have stated in The Problems the reasons 
<A NAME="189"></A>why these operations, namely banking up and covering up a fire, have the 
<A NAME="190"></A>opposite effects (in the one case the fire goes out, in the other it continues 
<A NAME="191"></A>alive for a considerable time).
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="192"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>Everything living has soul, and it, as we have said, cannot exist 
<A NAME="194"></A>without the presence of heat in the constitution. In plants the natural 
<A NAME="195"></A>heat is sufficiently well kept alive by the aid which their nutriment and 
<A NAME="196"></A>the surrounding air supply. For the food has a cooling effect [as it enters, 
<A NAME="197"></A>just as it has in man] when first it is taken in, whereas abstinence from 
<A NAME="198"></A>food produces heat and thirst. The air, if it be motionless, becomes hot, 
<A NAME="199"></A>but by the entry of food a motion is set up which lasts until digestion 
<A NAME="200"></A>is completed and so cools it. If the surrounding air is excessively cold 
<A NAME="201"></A>owing to the time of year, there being severe frost, plants shrivel, or 
<A NAME="202"></A>if, in the extreme heats of summer the moisture drawn from the ground cannot 
<A NAME="203"></A>produce its cooling effect, the heat comes to an end by exhaustion. Trees 
<A NAME="204"></A>suffering at such seasons are said to be blighted or star-stricken. Hence 
<A NAME="205"></A>the practice of laying beneath the roots stones of certain species or water 
<A NAME="206"></A>in pots, for the purpose of cooling the roots of the 
<A NAME="207"></A>plants.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>Some animals pass their life in the water, others in the air, and 
<A NAME="209"></A>therefore these media furnish the source and means of refrigeration, water 
<A NAME="210"></A>in the one case, air in the other. We must proceed-and it will require 
<A NAME="211"></A>further application on our part-to give an account of the way and manner 
<A NAME="212"></A>in which this refrigeration occurs.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="213"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>A few of the previous physical philosophers have spoken of respiration. 
<A NAME="215"></A>The reason, however, why it exists in animals they have either not declared 
<A NAME="216"></A>or, when they have, their statements are not correct and show a comparative 
<A NAME="217"></A>lack of acquaintance with the facts. Moreover they assert that all animals 
<A NAME="218"></A>respire-which is untrue. Hence these points must first claim our attention, 
<A NAME="219"></A>in order that we may not be thought to make unsubstantiated charges against 
<A NAME="220"></A>authors no longer alive.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>First then, it is evident that all animals with lungs breathe, 
<A NAME="222"></A>but in some cases breathing animals have a bloodless and spongy lung, and 
<A NAME="223"></A>then there is less need for respiration. These animals can remain under 
<A NAME="224"></A>water for a time, which relatively to their bodily strength, is considerable. 
<A NAME="225"></A>All oviparous animals, e.g. the frog-tribe, have a spongy lung. Also hemydes 
<A NAME="226"></A>and tortoises can remain for a long time immersed in water; for their lung, 
<A NAME="227"></A>containing little blood, has not much heat. Hence, when once it is inflated, 
<A NAME="228"></A>it itself, by means of its motion, produces a cooling effect and enables 
<A NAME="229"></A>the animal to remain immersed for a long time. Suffocation, however, always 
<A NAME="230"></A>ensues if the animal is forced to hold its breath for too long a time, 
<A NAME="231"></A>for none of this class take in water in the way fishes do. On the other 
<A NAME="232"></A>hand, animals which have the lung charged with blood have greater need 
<A NAME="233"></A>of respiration on account of the amount of their heat, while none at all 
<A NAME="234"></A>of the others which do not possess lungs breathe.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="235"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>Democritus of Abdera and certain others who have treated of respiration, 
<A NAME="237"></A>while saying nothing definite about the lungless animals, nevertheless 
<A NAME="238"></A>seem to speak as if all breathed. But Anaxagoras and Diogenes both maintain 
<A NAME="239"></A>that all breathe, and state the manner in which fishes and oysters respire. 
<A NAME="240"></A>Anaxagoras says that when fishes discharge water through their gills, air 
<A NAME="241"></A>is formed in the mouth, for there can be no vacuum, and that it is by drawing 
<A NAME="242"></A>in this that they respire. Diogenes' statement is that, when they discharge 
<A NAME="243"></A>water through their gills, they suck the air out of the water surrounding 
<A NAME="244"></A>the mouth by means of the vacuum formed in the mouth, for he believes there 
<A NAME="245"></A>is air in the water.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>But these theories are untenable. Firstly, they state only what 
<A NAME="247"></A>is the common element in both operations and so leave out the half of the 
<A NAME="248"></A>matter. For what goes by the name of respiration consists, on the one hand, 
<A NAME="249"></A>of inhalation, and, on the other, of the exhalation of breath; but, about 
<A NAME="250"></A>the latter they say nothing, nor do they describe how such animals emit 
<A NAME="251"></A>their breath. Indeed, explanation is for them impossible for, when the 
<A NAME="252"></A>creatures respire, they must discharge their breath by the same passage 
<A NAME="253"></A>as that by which they draw it in, and this must happen in alternation. 
<A NAME="254"></A>Hence, as a result, they must take the water into their mouth at the same 
<A NAME="255"></A>time as they breathe out. But the air and the water must meet and obstruct 
<A NAME="256"></A>each other. Further, when they discharge the water they must emit their 
<A NAME="257"></A>breath by the mouth or the gills, and the result will be that they will 
<A NAME="258"></A>breathe in and breathe out at the same time, for it is at that moment that 
<A NAME="259"></A>respiration is said to occur. But it is impossible that they should do 
<A NAME="260"></A>both at the same time. Hence, if respiring creatures must both exhale and 
<A NAME="261"></A>inhale the air, and if none of these animals can breathe out, evidently 
<A NAME="262"></A>none can respire at all.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="263"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>Further, the assertion that they draw in air out of the mouth or 
<A NAME="265"></A>out of the water by means of the mouth is an impossibility, for, not having 
<A NAME="266"></A>a lung, they have no windpipe; rather the stomach is closely juxtaposed 
<A NAME="267"></A>to the mouth, so that they must do the sucking with the stomach. But in 
<A NAME="268"></A>that case the other animals would do so also, which is not the truth; and 
<A NAME="269"></A>the water-animals also would be seen to do it when out of the water, whereas 
<A NAME="270"></A>quite evidently they do not. Further, in all animals that respire and draw 
<A NAME="271"></A>breath there is to be observed a certain motion in the part of the body 
<A NAME="272"></A>which draws in the air, but in the fishes this does not occur. Fishes do 
<A NAME="273"></A>not appear to move any of the parts in the region of the stomach, except 
<A NAME="274"></A>the gills alone, and these move both when they are in the water and when 
<A NAME="275"></A>they are thrown on to dry land and gasp. Moreover, always when respiring 
<A NAME="276"></A>animals are killed by being suffocated in water, bubbles are formed of 
<A NAME="277"></A>the air which is forcibly discharged, as happens, e.g. when one forces 
<A NAME="278"></A>a tortoise or a frog or any other animal of a similar class to stay beneath 
<A NAME="279"></A>water. But with fishes this result never occurs, in whatsoever way we try 
<A NAME="280"></A>to obtain it, since they do not contain air drawn from an external source. 
<A NAME="281"></A>Again, the manner of respiration said to exist in them might occur in the 
<A NAME="282"></A>case of men also when they are under water. For if fishes draw in air out 
<A NAME="283"></A>of the surrounding water by means of their mouth why should not men too 
<A NAME="284"></A>and other animals do so also; they should also, in the same way as fishes, 
<A NAME="285"></A>draw in air out of the mouth. If in the former case it were possible, so 
<A NAME="286"></A>also should it be in the latter. But, since in the one it is not so, neither 
<A NAME="287"></A>does it occur in the other. Furthermore, why do fishes, if they respire, 
<A NAME="288"></A>die in the air and gasp (as can be seen) as in suffocation? It is not want 
<A NAME="289"></A>of food that produces this effect upon them, and the reason given by Diogenes 
<A NAME="290"></A>is foolish, for he says that in air they take in too much air and hence 
<A NAME="291"></A>die, but in the water they take in a moderate amount. But that should be 
<A NAME="292"></A>a possible occurrence with land animals also; as facts are, however, no 
<A NAME="293"></A>land animal seems to be suffocated by excessive respiration. Again, if 
<A NAME="294"></A>all animals breathe, insects must do so also. many of them seem to live 
<A NAME="295"></A>though divided not merely into two, but into several parts, e.g. the class 
<A NAME="296"></A>called Scolopendra. But how can they, when thus divided, breathe, and what 
<A NAME="297"></A>is the organ they employ? The main reason why these writers have not given 
<A NAME="298"></A>a good account of these facts is that they have no acquaintance with the 
<A NAME="299"></A>internal organs, and that they did not accept the doctrine that there is 
<A NAME="300"></A>a final cause for whatever Nature does. If they had asked for what purpose 
<A NAME="301"></A>respiration exists in animals, and had considered this with reference to 
<A NAME="302"></A>the organs, e.g. the gills and the lungs, they would have discovered the 
<A NAME="303"></A>reason more speedily.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="304"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>Democritus, however, does teach that in the breathing animals there 
<A NAME="306"></A>is a certain result produced by respiration; he asserts that it prevents 
<A NAME="307"></A>the soul from being extruded from the body. Nevertheless, he by no means 
<A NAME="308"></A>asserts that it is for this purpose that Nature so contrives it, for he, 
<A NAME="309"></A>like the other physical philosophers, altogether fails to attain to any 
<A NAME="310"></A>such explanation. His statement is that the soul and the hot element are 
<A NAME="311"></A>identical, being the primary forms among the spherical particles. Hence, 
<A NAME="312"></A>when these are being crushed together by the surrounding atmosphere thrusting 
<A NAME="313"></A>them out, respiration, according to his account, comes in to succour them. 
<A NAME="314"></A>For in the air there are many of those particles which he calls mind and 
<A NAME="315"></A>soul. Hence, when we breathe and the air enters, these enter along with 
<A NAME="316"></A>it, and by their action cancel the pressure, thus preventing the expulsion 
<A NAME="317"></A>of the soul which resides in the animal.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>This explains why life and death are bound up with the taking in 
<A NAME="319"></A>and letting out of the breath; for death occurs when the compression by 
<A NAME="320"></A>the surrounding air gains the upper hand, and, the animal being unable 
<A NAME="321"></A>to respire, the air from outside can no longer enter and counteract the 
<A NAME="322"></A>compression. Death is the departure of those forms owing to the expulsive 
<A NAME="323"></A>pressure exerted by the surrounding air. Death, however, occurs not by 
<A NAME="324"></A>haphazard but, when natural, owing to old age, and, when unnatural, to 
<A NAME="325"></A>violence.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>But the reason for this and why all must die Democritus has by 
<A NAME="327"></A>no means made clear. And yet, since evidently death occurs at one time 
<A NAME="328"></A>of life and not at another, he should have said whether the cause is external 
<A NAME="329"></A>or internal. Neither does he assign the cause of the beginning of respiration, 
<A NAME="330"></A>nor say whether it is internal or external. Indeed, it is not the case 
<A NAME="331"></A>that the external mind superintends the reinforcement; rather the origin 
<A NAME="332"></A>of breathing and of the respiratory motion must be within: it is not due 
<A NAME="333"></A>to pressure from around. It is absurd also that what surrounds should compress 
<A NAME="334"></A>and at the same time by entering dilate. This then is practically his theory, 
<A NAME="335"></A>and how he puts it.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>But if we must consider that our previous account is true, and 
<A NAME="337"></A>that respiration does not occur in every animal, we must deem that this 
<A NAME="338"></A>explains death not universally, but only in respiring animals. Yet neither 
<A NAME="339"></A>is it a good account of these even, as may clearly be seen from the facts 
<A NAME="340"></A>and phenomena of which we all have experience. For in hot weather we grow 
<A NAME="341"></A>warmer, and, having more need of respiration, we always breathe faster. 
<A NAME="342"></A>But, when the air around is cold and contracts and solidifies the body, 
<A NAME="343"></A>retardation of the breathing results. Yet this was just the time when the 
<A NAME="344"></A>external air should enter and annul the expulsive movement, whereas it 
<A NAME="345"></A>is the opposite that occurs. For when the breath is not let out and the 
<A NAME="346"></A>heat accumulates too much then we need to respire, and to respire we must 
<A NAME="347"></A>draw in the breath. When hot, people breathe rapidly, because they must 
<A NAME="348"></A>do so in order to cool themselves, just when the theory of Democritus would 
<A NAME="349"></A>make them add fire to fire.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="350"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>The theory found in the Timaeus, of the passing round of the breath 
<A NAME="352"></A>by pushing, by no means determines how, in the case of the animals other 
<A NAME="353"></A>than land-animals, their heat is preserved, and whether it is due to the 
<A NAME="354"></A>same or a different cause. For if respiration occurs only in land-animals 
<A NAME="355"></A>we should be told what is the reason of that. Likewise, if it is found 
<A NAME="356"></A>in others also, but in a different form, this form of respiration, if they 
<A NAME="357"></A>all can breathe, must also be described.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>Further, the method of explaining involves a fiction. It is said 
<A NAME="359"></A>that when the hot air issues from the mouth it pushes the surrounding air, 
<A NAME="360"></A>which being carried on enters the very place whence the internal warmth 
<A NAME="361"></A>issued, through the interstices of the porous flesh; and this reciprocal 
<A NAME="362"></A>replacement is due to the fact that a vacuum cannot exist. But when it 
<A NAME="363"></A>has become hot the air passes out again by the same route, and pushes back 
<A NAME="364"></A>inwards through the mouth the air that had been discharged in a warm condition. 
<A NAME="365"></A>It is said that it is this action which goes on continuously when the breath 
<A NAME="366"></A>is taken in and let out.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR>But according to this way of thinking it will follow that we breathe 
<A NAME="368"></A>out before we breathe in. But the opposite is the case, as evidence shows, 
<A NAME="369"></A>for though these two functions go on in alternation, yet the last act when 
<A NAME="370"></A>life comes to a close is the letting out of the breath, and hence its admission 
<A NAME="371"></A>must have been the beginning of the process.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>Once more, those who give this kind of explanation by no means 
<A NAME="373"></A>state the final cause of the presence in animals of this function (to wit 
<A NAME="374"></A>the admission and emission of the breath), but treat it as though it were 
<A NAME="375"></A>a contingent accompaniment of life. Yet it evidently has control over life 
<A NAME="376"></A>and death, for it results synchronously that when respiring animals are 
<A NAME="377"></A>unable to breathe they perish. Again, it is absurd that the passage of 
<A NAME="378"></A>the hot air out through the mouth and back again should be quite perceptible, 
<A NAME="379"></A>while we were not able to detect the thoracic influx and the return outwards 
<A NAME="380"></A>once more of the heated breath. It is also nonsense that respiration should 
<A NAME="381"></A>consist in the entrance of heat, for the evidence is to the contrary effect; 
<A NAME="382"></A>what is breathed out is hot, and what is breathed in is cold. When it is 
<A NAME="383"></A>hot we pant in breathing, for, because what enters does not adequately 
<A NAME="384"></A>perform its cooling function, we have as a consequence to draw the breath 
<A NAME="385"></A>frequently.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="386"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>It is certain, however, that we must not entertain the notion that 
<A NAME="388"></A>it is for purposes of nutrition that respiration is designed, and believe 
<A NAME="389"></A>that the internal fire is fed by the breath; respiration, as it were, adding 
<A NAME="390"></A>fuel to the fire, while the feeding of the flame results in the outward 
<A NAME="391"></A>passage of the breath. To combat this doctrine I shall repeat what I said 
<A NAME="392"></A>in opposition to the previous theories. This, or something analogous to 
<A NAME="393"></A>it, should occur in the other animals also (on this theory), for all possess 
<A NAME="394"></A>vital heat. Further, how are we to describe this fictitious process of 
<A NAME="395"></A>the generation of heat from the breath? Observation shows rather that it 
<A NAME="396"></A>is a product of the food. A consequence also of this theory is that the 
<A NAME="397"></A>nutriment would enter and the refuse be discharged by the same channel, 
<A NAME="398"></A>but this does not appear to occur in the other instances.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="399"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>Empedocles also gives an account of respiration without, however, 
<A NAME="401"></A>making clear what its purpose is, or whether or not it is universal in 
<A NAME="402"></A>animals. Also when dealing with respiration by means of the nostrils he 
<A NAME="403"></A>imagines he is dealing with what is the primary kind of respiration. Even 
<A NAME="404"></A>the breath which passes through the nostrils passes through the windpipe 
<A NAME="405"></A>out of the chest as well, and without the latter the nostrils cannot act. 
<A NAME="406"></A>Again, when animals are bereft of respiration through the nostrils, no 
<A NAME="407"></A>detrimental result ensues, but, when prevented from breathing through the 
<A NAME="408"></A>windpipe, they die. Nature employs respiration through the nostrils as 
<A NAME="409"></A>a secondary function in certain animals in order to enable them to smell. 
<A NAME="410"></A>But the reason why it exists in some only is that though almost all animals 
<A NAME="411"></A>are endowed with the sense of smell, the sense-organ is not the same in 
<A NAME="412"></A>all.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>A more precise account has been given about this elsewhere. Empedocles, 
<A NAME="414"></A>however, explains the passage inwards and outwards of the breath, by the 
<A NAME="415"></A>theory that there are certain blood-vessels, which, while containing blood, 
<A NAME="416"></A>are not filled by it, but have passages leading to the outer air, the calibre 
<A NAME="417"></A>of which is fine in contrast to the size of the solid particles, but large 
<A NAME="418"></A>relatively to those in the air. Hence, since it is the nature of the blood 
<A NAME="419"></A>to move upwards and downwards, when it moves down the air rushes in and 
<A NAME="420"></A>inspiration occurs; when the blood rises, the air is forced out and the 
<A NAME="421"></A>outward motion of the breath results. He compares this process to what 
<A NAME="422"></A>occurs in a clepsydra.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>Thus all things outwards breathe and in;- their flesh has 
<A NAME="424"></A>tubes
<A NAME="425"></A><BR>Bloodless, that stretch towards the body's outmost 
<A NAME="426"></A>edge,
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>Which, at their mouths, full many frequent channels 
<A NAME="428"></A>pierce,
<A NAME="429"></A><BR>Cleaving the extreme nostrils through; thus, while the gore <B>Lies 
<A NAME="430"></A>hid, for air is cut a thoroughfare most plain.</B> <B>And thence, whenever 
<A NAME="431"></A>shrinks away the tender blood,</B>
<A NAME="432"></A><BR>Enters the blustering wind with swelling billow 
<A NAME="433"></A>wild.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR>But when the blood leaps up, backward it breathes. As 
<A NAME="435"></A>when
<A NAME="436"></A><BR>With water-clock of polished bronze a maiden sporting, <B>Sets on her 
<A NAME="437"></A>comely hand the narrow of the tube</B>
<A NAME="438"></A><BR>And dips it in the frail-formed water's silvery sheen; <B>Not then 
<A NAME="439"></A>the flood the vessel enters, but the air,</B> <B>Until she frees the crowded 
<A NAME="440"></A>stream. But then indeed</B> <B>Upon the escape runs in the water meet.</B> 
<A NAME="441"></A><B>So also when within the vessel's deeps the water</B>
<A NAME="442"></A><BR>Remains, the opening by the hand of flesh being 
<A NAME="443"></A>closed,
<A NAME="444"></A><BR>The outer air that entrance craves restrains the flood <B>At the gates 
<A NAME="445"></A>of the sounding narrow,</B> <B>upon the surface pressing,</B>
<A NAME="446"></A><BR>Until the maid withdraws her hand. But then in contrariwise
<A NAME="447"></A><BR>Once more the air comes in and water meet flows 
<A NAME="448"></A>out.
<A NAME="449"></A><BR>Thus to the to the subtle blood, surging throughout the limbs, <B>Whene'er 
<A NAME="450"></A>it shrinks away into the far recesses</B> <B>Admits a stream of air rushing 
<A NAME="451"></A>with swelling wave,</B>
<A NAME="452"></A><BR>But, when it backward leaps, in like bulk air flows 
<A NAME="453"></A>out.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>This then is what he says of respiration. But, as we said, all 
<A NAME="455"></A>animals that evidently respire do so by means of the windpipe, when they 
<A NAME="456"></A>breathe either through the mouth or through the nostrils. Hence, if it 
<A NAME="457"></A>is of this kind of respiration that he is talking, we must ask how it tallies 
<A NAME="458"></A>with the explanation given. But the facts seem to be quite opposed. The 
<A NAME="459"></A>chest is raised in the manner of a forge-bellows when the breath is drawn 
<A NAME="460"></A>in-it is quite reasonable that it should be heat which raises up and that 
<A NAME="461"></A>the blood should occupy the hot region-but it collapses and sinks down, 
<A NAME="462"></A>like the bellows once more, when the breath is let out. The difference 
<A NAME="463"></A>is that in a bellows it is not by the same channel that the air is taken 
<A NAME="464"></A>in and let out, but in breathing it is.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>But, if Empedocles is accounting only for respiration through the 
<A NAME="466"></A>nostrils, he is much in error, for that does not involve the nostrils alone, 
<A NAME="467"></A>but passes by the channel beside the uvula where the extremity of the roof 
<A NAME="468"></A>of the mouth is, some of the air going this way through the apertures of 
<A NAME="469"></A>the nostrils and some through the mouth, both when it enters and when it 
<A NAME="470"></A>passes out. Such then is the nature and magnitude of the difficulties besetting 
<A NAME="471"></A>the theories of other writers concerning respiration.
