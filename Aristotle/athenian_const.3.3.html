<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 45</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>In former times the Council had full powers to inflict fines and imprisonment 
<A NAME="12"></A>and death; but when it had consigned Lysimachus to the executioner, and 
<A NAME="13"></A>he was sitting in the immediate expectation of death, Eumelides of Alopece 
<A NAME="14"></A>rescued him from its hands, maintaining that no citizen ought to be put 
<A NAME="15"></A>to death except on the decision of a court of law. Accordingly a trial 
<A NAME="16"></A>was held in a law-court, and Lysimachus was acquitted, receiving henceforth 
<A NAME="17"></A>the nickname of 'the man from the drum-head'; and the people deprived the 
<A NAME="18"></A>Council thenceforward of the power to inflict death or imprisonment or 
<A NAME="19"></A>fine, passing a law that if the Council condemn any person for an offence 
<A NAME="20"></A>or inflict a fine, the Thesmothetae shall bring the sentence or fine before 
<A NAME="21"></A>the law-court, and the decision of the jurors shall be the final judgement 
<A NAME="22"></A>in the matter.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR>The Council passes judgement on nearly all magistrates, especially 
<A NAME="24"></A>those who have the control of money; its judgement, however, is not final, 
<A NAME="25"></A>but is subject to an appeal to the lawcourts. Private individuals, also, 
<A NAME="26"></A>may lay an information against any magistrate they please for not obeying 
<A NAME="27"></A>the laws, but here too there is an appeal to the law-courts if the Council 
<A NAME="28"></A>declare the charge proved. The Council also examines those who are to be 
<A NAME="29"></A>its members for the ensuing year, and likewise the nine Archons. Formerly 
<A NAME="30"></A>the Council had full power to reject candidates for office as unsuitable, 
<A NAME="31"></A>but now they have an appeal to the law-courts. In all these matters, therefore, 
<A NAME="32"></A>the Council has no final jurisdiction. It takes, however, preliminary cognizance 
<A NAME="33"></A>of all matters brought before the Assembly, and the Assembly cannot vote 
<A NAME="34"></A>on any question unless it has first been considered by the Council and 
<A NAME="35"></A>placed on the programme by the Prytanes; since a person who carries a motion 
<A NAME="36"></A>in the Assembly is liable to an action for illegal proposal on these 
<A NAME="37"></A>grounds.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="38"></A><B>Part 46</B>

<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>The Council also superintends the triremes that are already in 
<A NAME="40"></A>existence, with their tackle and sheds, and builds new triremes or quadriremes, 
<A NAME="41"></A>whichever the Assembly votes, with tackle and sheds to match. The Assembly 
<A NAME="42"></A>appoints master-builders for the ships by vote; and if they do not hand 
<A NAME="43"></A>them over completed to the next Council, the old Council cannot receive 
<A NAME="44"></A>the customary donation-that being normally given to it during its successor's 
<A NAME="45"></A>term of office. For the building of the triremes it appoints ten commissioners, 
<A NAME="46"></A>chosen from its own members. The Council also inspects all public buildings, 
<A NAME="47"></A>and if it is of opinion that the state is being defrauded, it reports the 
<A NAME="48"></A>culprit to the Assembly, and on condemnation hands him over to the 
<A NAME="49"></A>law-courts.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="50"></A><B>Part 47</B>

<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>The Council also co-operates with other magistrates in most of 
<A NAME="52"></A>their duties. First there are the treasurers of Athena, ten in number, 
<A NAME="53"></A>elected by lot, one from each tribe. According to the law of Solon-which 
<A NAME="54"></A>is still in force-they must be Pentacosiomedimni, but in point of fact 
<A NAME="55"></A>the person on whom the lot falls holds the office even though he be quite 
<A NAME="56"></A>a poor man. These officers take over charge of the statue of Athena, the 
<A NAME="57"></A>figures of Victory, and all the other ornaments of the temple, together 
<A NAME="58"></A>with the money, in the presence of the Council. Then there are the Commissioners 
<A NAME="59"></A>for Public Contracts (Poletae), ten in number, one chosen by lot from each 
<A NAME="60"></A>tribe, who farm out the public contracts. They lease the mines and taxes, 
<A NAME="61"></A>in conjunction with the Military Treasurer and the Commissioners of the 
<A NAME="62"></A>Theoric fund, in the presence of the Council, and grant, to the persons 
<A NAME="63"></A>indicated by the vote of the Council, the mines which are let out by the 
<A NAME="64"></A>state, including both the workable ones, which are let for three years, 
<A NAME="65"></A>and those which are let under special agreements years. They also sell, 
<A NAME="66"></A>in the presence of the Council, the property of those who have gone into 
<A NAME="67"></A>exile from the court of the Areopagus, and of others whose goods have been 
<A NAME="68"></A>confiscated, and the nine Archons ratify the contracts. They also hand 
<A NAME="69"></A>over to the Council lists of the taxes which are farmed out for the year, 
<A NAME="70"></A>entering on whitened tablets the name of the lessee and the amount paid. 
<A NAME="71"></A>They make separate lists, first of those who have to pay their instalments 
<A NAME="72"></A>in each prytany, on ten several tablets, next of those who pay thrice in 
<A NAME="73"></A>the year, with a separate tablet for each instalment, and finally of those 
<A NAME="74"></A>who pay in the ninth prytany. They also draw up a list of farms and dwellings 
<A NAME="75"></A>which have been confiscated and sold by order of the courts; for these 
<A NAME="76"></A>too come within their province. In the case of dwellings the value must 
<A NAME="77"></A>be paid up in five years, and in that of farms, in ten. The instalments 
<A NAME="78"></A>are paid in the ninth prytany. Further, the King-archon brings before the 
<A NAME="79"></A>Council the leases of the sacred enclosures, written on whitened tablets. 
<A NAME="80"></A>These too are leased for ten years, and the instalments are paid in the 
<A NAME="81"></A>prytany; consequently it is in this prytany that the greatest amount of 
<A NAME="82"></A>money is collected. The tablets containing the lists of the instalments 
<A NAME="83"></A>are carried into the Council, and the public clerk takes charge of them. 
<A NAME="84"></A>Whenever a payment of instalments is to be made he takes from the pigeon-holes 
<A NAME="85"></A>the precise list of the sums which are to be paid and struck off on that 
<A NAME="86"></A>day, and delivers it to the Receivers-General. The rest are kept apart, 
<A NAME="87"></A>in order that no sum may be struck off before it is 
<A NAME="88"></A>paid.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="89"></A><B>Part 48</B>

<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>There are ten Receivers-General (Apodectae), elected by lot, one 
<A NAME="91"></A>from each tribe. These officers receive the tablets, and strike off the 
<A NAME="92"></A>instalments as they are paid, in the presence of the Council in the Council-chamber, 
<A NAME="93"></A>and give the tablets back to the public clerk. If any one fails to pay 
<A NAME="94"></A>his instalment, a note is made of it on the tablet; and he is bound to 
<A NAME="95"></A>pay double the amount of the deficiency, or, in default, to be imprisoned. 
<A NAME="96"></A>The Council has full power by the laws to exact these payments and to inflict 
<A NAME="97"></A>this imprisonment. They receive all the instalments, therefore, on one 
<A NAME="98"></A>day, and portion the money out among the magistrates; and on the next day 
<A NAME="99"></A>they bring up the report of the apportionment, written on a wooden notice-board, 
<A NAME="100"></A>and read it out in the Council-chamber, after which they ask publicly in 
<A NAME="101"></A>the Council whether any one knows of any malpractice in reference to the 
<A NAME="102"></A>apportionment, on the part of either a magistrate or a private individual, 
<A NAME="103"></A>and if any one is charged with malpractice they take a vote on 
<A NAME="104"></A>it.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>The Council also elects ten Auditors (Logistae) by lot from its 
<A NAME="106"></A>own members, to audit the accounts of the magistrates for each prytany. 
<A NAME="107"></A>They also elect one Examiner of Accounts (Euthunus) by lot from each tribe, 
<A NAME="108"></A>with two assessors (Paredri) for each examiner, whose duty it is to sit 
<A NAME="109"></A>at the ordinary market hours, each opposite the statue of the eponymous 
<A NAME="110"></A>hero of his tribe; and if any one wishes to prefer a charge, on either 
<A NAME="111"></A>public or private grounds, against any magistrate who has passed his audit 
<A NAME="112"></A>before the law-courts, within three days of his having so passed, he enters 
<A NAME="113"></A>on a whitened tablet his own name and that of the magistrate prosecuted, 
<A NAME="114"></A>together with the malpractice that is alleged against him. He also appends 
<A NAME="115"></A>his claim for a penalty of such amount as seems to him fitting, and gives 
<A NAME="116"></A>in the record to the Examiner. The latter takes it, and if after reading 
<A NAME="117"></A>it he considers it proved he hands it over, if a private case, to the local 
<A NAME="118"></A>justices who introduce cases for the tribe concerned, while if it is a 
<A NAME="119"></A>public case he enters it on the register of the Thesmothetae. Then, if 
<A NAME="120"></A>the Thesmothetae accept it, they bring the accounts of this magistrate 
<A NAME="121"></A>once more before the law-court, and the decision of the jury stands as 
<A NAME="122"></A>the final judgement.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="123"></A><B>Part 49</B>

<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>The Council also inspects the horses belonging to the state. If 
<A NAME="125"></A>a man who has a good horse is found to keep it in bad condition, he is 
<A NAME="126"></A>mulcted in his allowance of corn; while those which cannot keep up or which 
<A NAME="127"></A>shy and will not stand steady, it brands with a wheel on the jaw, and the 
<A NAME="128"></A>horse so marked is disqualified for service. It also inspects those who 
<A NAME="129"></A>appear to be fit for service as scouts, and any one whom it rejects is 
<A NAME="130"></A>deprived of his horse. It also examines the infantry who serve among the 
<A NAME="131"></A>cavalry, and any one whom it rejects ceases to receive his pay. The roll 
<A NAME="132"></A>of the cavalry is drawn up by the Commissioners of Enrolment (Catalogeis), 
<A NAME="133"></A>ten in number, elected by the Assembly by open vote. They hand over to 
<A NAME="134"></A>the Hipparchs and Phylarchs the list of those whom they have enrolled, 
<A NAME="135"></A>and these officers take it and bring it up before the Council, and there 
<A NAME="136"></A>open the sealed tablet containing the names of the cavalry. If any of those 
<A NAME="137"></A>who have been on the roll previously make affidavit that they are physically 
<A NAME="138"></A>incapable of cavalry service, they strike them out; then they call up the 
<A NAME="139"></A>persons newly enrolled, and if any one makes affidavit that he is either 
<A NAME="140"></A>physically or pecuniarily incapable of cavalry service they dismiss him, 
<A NAME="141"></A>but if no such affidavit is made the Council vote whether the individual 
<A NAME="142"></A>in question is suitable for the purpose or not. If they vote in the affirmative 
<A NAME="143"></A>his name is entered on the tablet; if not, he is dismissed with the 
<A NAME="144"></A>others.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>Formerly the Council used to decide on the plans for public buildings 
<A NAME="146"></A>and the contract for making the robe of Athena; but now this work is done 
<A NAME="147"></A>by a jury in the law-courts appointed by lot, since the Council was considered 
<A NAME="148"></A>to have shown favouritism in its decisions. The Council also shares with 
<A NAME="149"></A>the Military Treasurer the superintendence of the manufacture of the images 
<A NAME="150"></A>of Victory and the prizes at the Panathenaic festival.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>The Council also examines infirm paupers; for there is a law which 
<A NAME="152"></A>provides that persons possessing less than three minas, who are so crippled 
<A NAME="153"></A>as to be unable to do any work, are, after examination by the Council, 
<A NAME="154"></A>to receive two obols a day from the state for their support. A treasurer 
<A NAME="155"></A>is appointed by lot to attend to them.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>The Council also, speaking broadly, cooperates in most of the duties 
<A NAME="157"></A>of all the other magistrates; and this ends the list of the functions of 
<A NAME="158"></A>that body.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="159"></A><B>Part 50</B>

<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>There are ten Commissioners for Repairs of Temples, elected by 
<A NAME="161"></A>lot, who receive a sum of thirty minas from the Receivers-General, and 
<A NAME="162"></A>therewith carry out the most necessary repairs in the 
<A NAME="163"></A>temples.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>There are also ten City Commissioners (Astynomi), of whom five 
<A NAME="165"></A>hold office in Piraeus and five in the city. Their duty is to see that 
<A NAME="166"></A>female flute-and harp-and lute-players are not hired at more than two drachmas, 
<A NAME="167"></A>and if more than one person is anxious to hire the same girl, they cast 
<A NAME="168"></A>lots and hire her out to the person to whom the lot falls. They also provide 
<A NAME="169"></A>that no collector of sewage shall shoot any of his sewage within ten stradia 
<A NAME="170"></A>of the walls; they prevent people from blocking up the streets by building, 
<A NAME="171"></A>or stretching barriers across them, or making drain-pipes in mid-air with 
<A NAME="172"></A>a discharge into the street, or having doors which open outwards; they 
<A NAME="173"></A>also remove the corpses of those who die in the streets, for which purpose 
<A NAME="174"></A>they have a body of state slaves assigned to them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="175"></A><B>Part 51</B>

<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>Market Commissioners (Agoranomi) are elected by lot, five for Piraeus, 
<A NAME="177"></A>five for the city. Their statutory duty is to see that all articles offered 
<A NAME="178"></A>for sale in the market are pure and unadulterated.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>Commissioners of Weights and Measures (Metronomi) are elected by 
<A NAME="180"></A>lot, five for the city, and five for Piraeus. They see that sellers use 
<A NAME="181"></A>fair weights and measures.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>Formerly there were ten Corn Commissioners (Sitophylaces), elected 
<A NAME="183"></A>by lot, five for Piraeus, and five for the city; but now there are twenty 
<A NAME="184"></A>for the city and fifteen for Piraeus. Their duties are, first, to see that 
<A NAME="185"></A>the unprepared corn in the market is offered for sale at reasonable prices, 
<A NAME="186"></A>and secondly, to see that the millers sell barley meal at a price proportionate 
<A NAME="187"></A>to that of barley, and that the bakers sell their loaves at a price proportionate 
<A NAME="188"></A>to that of wheat, and of such weight as the Commissioners may appoint; 
<A NAME="189"></A>for the law requires them to fix the standard weight.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>There are ten Superintendents of the Mart, elected by lot, whose 
<A NAME="191"></A>duty is to superintend the Mart, and to compel merchants to bring up into 
<A NAME="192"></A>the city two-thirds of the corn which is brought by sea to the Corn 
<A NAME="193"></A>Mart.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="194"></A><B>Part 52</B>

<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>The Eleven also are appointed by lot to take care of the prisoners 
<A NAME="196"></A>in the state gaol. Thieves, kidnappers, and pickpockets are brought to 
<A NAME="197"></A>them, and if they plead guilty they are executed, but if they deny the 
<A NAME="198"></A>charge the Eleven bring the case before the law-courts; if the prisoners 
<A NAME="199"></A>are acquitted, they release them, but if not, they then execute them. They 
<A NAME="200"></A>also bring up before the law-courts the list of farms and houses claimed 
<A NAME="201"></A>as state-property; and if it is decided that they are so, they deliver 
<A NAME="202"></A>them to the Commissioners for Public Contracts. The Eleven also bring up 
<A NAME="203"></A>informations laid against magistrates alleged to be disqualified; this 
<A NAME="204"></A>function comes within their province, but some such cases are brought up 
<A NAME="205"></A>by the Thesmothetae.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>There are also five Introducers of Cases (Eisagogeis), elected 
<A NAME="207"></A>by lot, one for each pair of tribes, who bring up the 'monthly' cases to 
<A NAME="208"></A>the law-courts. 'Monthly' cases are these: refusal to pay up a dowry where 
<A NAME="209"></A>a party is bound to do so, refusal to pay interest on money borrowed at 
<A NAME="210"></A>12 per cent., or where a man desirous of setting up business in the market 
<A NAME="211"></A>has borrowed from another man capital to start with; also cases of slander, 
<A NAME="212"></A>cases arising out of friendly loans or partnerships, and cases concerned 
<A NAME="213"></A>with slaves, cattle, and the office of trierarch, or with banks. These 
<A NAME="214"></A>are brought up as 'monthly' cases and are introduced by these officers; 
<A NAME="215"></A>but the Receivers-General perform the same function in cases for or against 
<A NAME="216"></A>the farmers of taxes. Those in which the sum concerned is not more than 
<A NAME="217"></A>ten drachmas they can decide summarily, but all above that amount they 
<A NAME="218"></A>bring into the law-courts as 'monthly' cases.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="219"></A><B>Part 53</B>

<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>The Forty are also elected by lot, four from each tribe, before 
<A NAME="221"></A>whom suitors bring all other cases. Formerly they were thirty in number, 
<A NAME="222"></A>and they went on circuit through the demes to hear causes; but after the 
<A NAME="223"></A>oligarchy of the Thirty they were increased to forty. They have full powers 
<A NAME="224"></A>to decide cases in which the amount at issue does not exceed ten drachmas, 
<A NAME="225"></A>but anything beyond that value they hand over to the Arbitrators. The Arbitrators 
<A NAME="226"></A>take up the case, and, if they cannot bring the parties to an agreement, 
<A NAME="227"></A>they give a decision. If their decision satisfies both parties, and they 
<A NAME="228"></A>abide by it, the case is at an end; but if either of the parties appeals 
<A NAME="229"></A>to the law-courts, the Arbitrators enclose the evidence, the pleadings, 
<A NAME="230"></A>and the laws quoted in the case in two urns, those of the plaintiff in 
<A NAME="231"></A>the one, and those of the defendant in the other. These they seal up and, 
<A NAME="232"></A>having attached to them the decision of the arbitrator, written out on 
<A NAME="233"></A>a tablet, place them in the custody of the four justices whose function 
<A NAME="234"></A>it is to introduce cases on behalf of the tribe of the defendant. These 
<A NAME="235"></A>officers take them and bring up the case before the law-court, to a jury 
<A NAME="236"></A>of two hundred and one members in cases up to the value of a thousand drachmas, 
<A NAME="237"></A>or to one of four hundred and one in cases above that value. No laws or 
<A NAME="238"></A>pleadings or evidence may be used except those which were adduced before 
<A NAME="239"></A>the Arbitrator, and have been enclosed in the urns.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>The Arbitrators are persons in the sixtieth year of their age; 
<A NAME="241"></A>this appears from the schedule of the Archons and the Eponymi. There are 
<A NAME="242"></A>two classes of Eponymi, the ten who give their names to the tribes, and 
<A NAME="243"></A>the forty-two of the years of service. The youths, on being enrolled among 
<A NAME="244"></A>the citizens, were formerly registered upon whitened tablets, and the names 
<A NAME="245"></A>were appended of the Archon in whose year they were enrolled, and of the 
<A NAME="246"></A>Eponymus who had been in course in the preceding year; at the present day 
<A NAME="247"></A>they are written on a bronze pillar, which stands in front of the Council-chamber, 
<A NAME="248"></A>near the Eponymi of the tribes. Then the Forty take the last of the Eponymi 
<A NAME="249"></A>of the years of service, and assign the arbitrations to the persons belonging 
<A NAME="250"></A>to that year, casting lots to determine which arbitrations each shall undertake; 
<A NAME="251"></A>and every one is compelled to carry through the arbitrations which the 
<A NAME="252"></A>lot assigns to him. The law enacts that any one who does not serve as Arbitrator 
<A NAME="253"></A>when he has arrived at the necessary age shall lose his civil rights, unless 
<A NAME="254"></A>he happens to be holding some other office during that year, or to be out 
<A NAME="255"></A>of the country. These are the only persons who escape the duty. Any one 
<A NAME="256"></A>who suffers injustice at the hands of the Arbitrator may appeal to the 
<A NAME="257"></A>whole board of Arbitrators, and if they find the magistrate guilty, the 
<A NAME="258"></A>law enacts that he shall lose his civil rights. The persons thus condemned 
<A NAME="259"></A>have, however, in their turn an appeal. The Eponymi are also used in reference 
<A NAME="260"></A>to military expeditions; when the men of military age are despatched on 
<A NAME="261"></A>service, a notice is put up stating that the men from such-and such an 
<A NAME="262"></A>Archon and Eponymus to such-and such another Archon and Eponymus are to 
<A NAME="263"></A>go on the expedition.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="264"></A><B>Part 54</B>

<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>The following magistrates also are elected by lot: Five Commissioners 
<A NAME="266"></A>of Roads (Hodopoei), who, with an assigned body of public slaves, are required 
<A NAME="267"></A>to keep the roads in order: and ten Auditors, with ten assistants, to whom 
<A NAME="268"></A>all persons who have held any office must give in their accounts. These 
<A NAME="269"></A>are the only officers who audit the accounts of those who are subject to 
<A NAME="270"></A>examination, and who bring them up for examination before the law-courts. 
<A NAME="271"></A>If they detect any magistrate in embezzlement, the jury condemn him for 
<A NAME="272"></A>theft, and he is obliged to repay tenfold the sum he is declared to have 
<A NAME="273"></A>misappropriated. If they charge a magistrate with accepting bribes and 
<A NAME="274"></A>the jury convict him, they fine him for corruption, and this sum too is 
<A NAME="275"></A>repaid tenfold. Or if they convict him of unfair dealing, he is fined on 
<A NAME="276"></A>that charge, and the sum assessed is paid without increase, if payment 
<A NAME="277"></A>is made before the ninth prytany, but otherwise it is doubled. A tenfold 
<A NAME="278"></A>fine is not doubled.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>The Clerk of the prytany, as he is called, is also elected by lot. 
<A NAME="280"></A>He has the charge of all public documents, and keeps the resolutions which 
<A NAME="281"></A>are passed by the Assembly, and checks the transcripts of all other official 
<A NAME="282"></A>papers and attends at the sessions of the Council. Formerly he was elected 
<A NAME="283"></A>by open vote, and the most distinguished and trustworthy persons were elected 
<A NAME="284"></A>to the post, as is known from the fact that the name of this officer is 
<A NAME="285"></A>appended on the pillars recording treaties of alliance and grants of consulship 
<A NAME="286"></A>and citizenship. Now, however, he is elected by lot. There is, in addition, 
<A NAME="287"></A>a Clerk of the Laws, elected by lot, who attends at the sessions of the 
<A NAME="288"></A>Council; and he too checks the transcript of all the laws. The Assembly 
<A NAME="289"></A>also elects by open vote a clerk to read documents to it and to the Council; 
<A NAME="290"></A>but he has no other duty except that of reading aloud.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>The Assembly also elects by lot the Commissioners of Public Worship 
<A NAME="292"></A>(Hieropoei) known as the Commissioners for Sacrifices, who offer the sacrifices 
<A NAME="293"></A>appointed by oracle, and, in conjunction with the seers, take the auspices 
<A NAME="294"></A>whenever there is occasion. It also elects by lot ten others, known as 
<A NAME="295"></A>Annual Commissioners, who offer certain sacrifices and administer all the 
<A NAME="296"></A>quadrennial festivals except the Panathenaea. There are the following quadrennial 
<A NAME="297"></A>festivals: first that of Delos (where there is also a sexennial festival), 
<A NAME="298"></A>secondly the Brauronia, thirdly the Heracleia, fourthly the Eleusinia, 
<A NAME="299"></A>and fifthly the Panathenaea; and no two of these are celebrated in the 
<A NAME="300"></A>same place. To these the Hephaestia has now been added, in the archonship 
<A NAME="301"></A>of Cephisophon.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>An Archon is also elected by lot for Salamis, and a Demarch for 
<A NAME="303"></A>Piraeus. These officers celebrate the Dionysia in these two places, and 
<A NAME="304"></A>appoint Choregi. In Salamis, moreover, the name of the Archon is publicly 
<A NAME="305"></A>recorded.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="306"></A><B>Part 55</B>

<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>All the foregoing magistrates are elected by lot, and their powers 
<A NAME="308"></A>are those which have been stated. To pass on to the nine Archons, as they 
<A NAME="309"></A>are called, the manner of their appointment from the earliest times has 
<A NAME="310"></A>been described already. At the present day six Thesmothetae are elected 
<A NAME="311"></A>by lot, together with their clerk, and in addition to these an Archon, 
<A NAME="312"></A>a King, and a Polemarch. One is elected from each tribe. They are examined 
<A NAME="313"></A>first of all by the Council of Five Hundred, with the exception of the 
<A NAME="314"></A>clerk. The latter is examined only in the lawcourt, like other magistrates 
<A NAME="315"></A>(for all magistrates, whether elected by lot or by open vote, are examined 
<A NAME="316"></A>before entering on their offices); but the nine Archons are examined both 
<A NAME="317"></A>in the Council and again in the law-court. Formerly no one could hold the 
<A NAME="318"></A>office if the Council rejected him, but now there is an appeal to the law-court, 
<A NAME="319"></A>which is the final authority in the matter of the examination. When they 
<A NAME="320"></A>are examined, they are asked, first, 'Who is your father, and of what deme? 
<A NAME="321"></A>who is your father's father? who is your mother? who is your mother's father, 
<A NAME="322"></A>and of what deme?' Then the candidate is asked whether he possesses an 
<A NAME="323"></A>ancestral Apollo and a household Zeus, and where their sanctuaries are; 
<A NAME="324"></A>next if he possesses a family tomb, and where; then if he treats his parents 
<A NAME="325"></A>well, and pays his taxes, and has served on the required military expeditions. 
<A NAME="326"></A>When the examiner has put these questions, he proceeds, 'Call the witnesses 
<A NAME="327"></A>to these facts'; and when the candidate has produced his witnesses, he 
<A NAME="328"></A>next asks, 'Does any one wish to make any accusation against this man?' 
<A NAME="329"></A>If an accuser appears, he gives the parties an opportunity of making their 
<A NAME="330"></A>accusation and defence, and then puts it to the Council to pass the candidate 
<A NAME="331"></A>or not, and to the law-court to give the final vote. If no one wishes to 
<A NAME="332"></A>make an accusation, he proceeds at once to the vote. Formerly a single 
<A NAME="333"></A>individual gave the vote, but now all the members are obliged to vote on 
<A NAME="334"></A>the candidates, so that if any unprincipled candidate has managed to get 
<A NAME="335"></A>rid of his accusers, it may still be possible for him to be disqualified 
<A NAME="336"></A>before the law-court. When the examination has been thus completed, they 
<A NAME="337"></A>proceed to the stone on which are the pieces of the victims, and on which 
<A NAME="338"></A>the Arbitrators take oath before declaring their decisions, and witnesses 
<A NAME="339"></A>swear to their testimony. On this stone the Archons stand, and swear to 
<A NAME="340"></A>execute their office uprightly and according to the laws, and not to receive 
<A NAME="341"></A>presents in respect of the performance of their duties, or, if they do, 
<A NAME="342"></A>to dedicate a golden statue. When they have taken this oath they proceed 
<A NAME="343"></A>to the Acropolis, and there they repeat it; after this they enter upon 
<A NAME="344"></A>their office.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="345"></A><B>Part 56</B>

<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>The Archon, the King, and the Polemarch have each two assessors, 
<A NAME="347"></A>nominated by themselves. These officers are examined in the lawcourt before 
<A NAME="348"></A>they begin to act, and give in accounts on each occasion of their 
<A NAME="349"></A>acting.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>As soon as the Archon enters office, he begins by issuing a proclamation 
<A NAME="351"></A>that whatever any one possessed before he entered into office, that he 
<A NAME="352"></A>shall possess and hold until the end of his term. Next he assigns Choregi 
<A NAME="353"></A>to the tragic poets, choosing three of the richest persons out of the whole 
<A NAME="354"></A>body of Athenians. Formerly he used also to assign five Choregi to the 
<A NAME="355"></A>comic poets, but now the tribes provide the Choregi for them. Then he receives 
<A NAME="356"></A>the Choregi who have been appointed by the tribes for the men's and boys' 
<A NAME="357"></A>choruses and the comic poets at the Dionysia, and for the men's and boys' 
<A NAME="358"></A>choruses at the Thargelia (at the Dionysia there is a chorus for each tribe, 
<A NAME="359"></A>but at the Thargelia one between two tribes, each tribe bearing its share 
<A NAME="360"></A>in providing it); he transacts the exchanges of properties for them, and 
<A NAME="361"></A>reports any excuses that are tendered, if any one says that he has already 
<A NAME="362"></A>borne this burden, or that he is exempt because he has borne a similar 
<A NAME="363"></A>burden and the period of his exemption has not yet expired, or that he 
<A NAME="364"></A>is not of the required age; since the Choregus of a boys' chorus must be 
<A NAME="365"></A>over forty years of age. He also appoints Choregi for the festival at Delos, 
<A NAME="366"></A>and a chief of the mission for the thirty-oar boat which conveys the youths 
<A NAME="367"></A>thither. He also superintends sacred processions, both that in honour of 
<A NAME="368"></A>Asclepius, when the initiated keep house, and that of the great Dionysia-the 
<A NAME="369"></A>latter in conjunction with the Superintendents of that festival. These 
<A NAME="370"></A>officers, ten in number, were formerly elected by open vote in the Assembly, 
<A NAME="371"></A>and used to provide for the expenses of the procession out of their private 
<A NAME="372"></A>means; but now one is elected by lot from each tribe, and the state contributes 
<A NAME="373"></A>a hundred minas for the expenses. The Archon also superintends the procession 
<A NAME="374"></A>at the Thargelia, and that in honour of Zeus the Saviour. He also manages 
<A NAME="375"></A>the contests at the Dionysia and the Thargelia.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>These, then, are the festivals which he superintends. The suits 
<A NAME="377"></A>and indictments which come before him, and which he, after a preliminary 
<A NAME="378"></A>inquiry, brings up before the lawcourts, are as follows. Injury to parents 
<A NAME="379"></A>(for bringing these actions the prosecutor cannot suffer any penalty); 
<A NAME="380"></A>injury to orphans (these actions lie against their guardians); injury to 
<A NAME="381"></A>a ward of state (these lie against their guardians or their husbands), 
<A NAME="382"></A>injury to an orphan's estate (these too lie against the guardians); mental 
<A NAME="383"></A>derangement, where a party charges another with destroying his own property 
<A NAME="384"></A>through unsoundness of mind; for appointment of liquidators, where a party 
<A NAME="385"></A>refuses to divide property in which others have a share; for constituting 
<A NAME="386"></A>a wardship; for determining between rival claims to a wardship; for granting 
<A NAME="387"></A>inspection of property to which another party lays claim; for appointing 
<A NAME="388"></A>oneself as guardian; and for determining disputes as to inheritances and 
<A NAME="389"></A>wards of state. The Archon also has the care of orphans and wards of state, 
<A NAME="390"></A>and of women who, on the death of their husbands, declare themselves to 
<A NAME="391"></A>be with child; and he has power to inflict a fine on those who offend against 
<A NAME="392"></A>the persons under his charge, or to bring the case before the law-courts. 
<A NAME="393"></A>He also leases the houses of orphans and wards of state until they reach 
<A NAME="394"></A>the age of fourteen, and takes mortgages on them; and if the guardians 
<A NAME="395"></A>fail to provide the necessary food for the children under their charge, 
<A NAME="396"></A>he exacts it from them. Such are the duties of the Archon.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="397"></A><B>Part 57</B>

<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>The King in the first place superintends the mysteries, in conjunction 
<A NAME="399"></A>with the Superintendents of Mysteries. The latter are elected in the Assembly 
<A NAME="400"></A>by open vote, two from the general body of Athenians, one from the Eumolpidae, 
<A NAME="401"></A>and one from the Ceryces. Next, he superintends the Lenaean Dionysia, which 
<A NAME="402"></A>consists of a procession and a contest. The procession is ordered by the 
<A NAME="403"></A>King and the Superintendents in conjunction; but the contest is managed 
<A NAME="404"></A>by the King alone. He also manages all the contests of the torch-race; 
<A NAME="405"></A>and to speak broadly, he administers all the ancestral sacrifices. Indictments 
<A NAME="406"></A>for impiety come before him, or any disputes between parties concerning 
<A NAME="407"></A>priestly rites; and he also determines all controversies concerning sacred 
<A NAME="408"></A>rites for the ancient families and the priests. All actions for homicide 
<A NAME="409"></A>come before him, and it is he that makes the proclamation requiring polluted 
<A NAME="410"></A>persons to keep away from sacred ceremonies. Actions for homicide and wounding 
<A NAME="411"></A>are heard, if the homicide or wounding be willful, in the Areopagus; so 
<A NAME="412"></A>also in cases of killing by poison, and of arson. These are the only cases 
<A NAME="413"></A>heard by that Council. Cases of unintentional homicide, or of intent to 
<A NAME="414"></A>kill, or of killing a slave or a resident alien or a foreigner, are heard 
<A NAME="415"></A>by the court of Palladium. When the homicide is acknowledged, but legal 
<A NAME="416"></A>justification is pleaded, as when a man takes an adulterer in the act, 
<A NAME="417"></A>or kills another by mistake in battle, or in an athletic contest, the prisoner 
<A NAME="418"></A>is tried in the court of Delphinium. If a man who is in banishment for 
<A NAME="419"></A>a homicide which admits of reconcilliation incurs a further charge of killing 
<A NAME="420"></A>or wounding, he is tried in Phreatto, and he makes his defence from a boat 
<A NAME="421"></A>moored near the shore. All these cases, except those which are heard in 
<A NAME="422"></A>the Areopagus, are tried by the Ephetae on whom the lot falls. The King 
<A NAME="423"></A>introduces them, and the hearing is held within sacred precincts and in 
<A NAME="424"></A>the open air. Whenever the King hears a case he takes off his crown. The 
<A NAME="425"></A>person who is charged with homicide is at all other times excluded from 
<A NAME="426"></A>the temples, nor is it even lawful for him to enter the market-place; but 
<A NAME="427"></A>on the occasion of his trial he enters the temple and makes his defence. 
<A NAME="428"></A>If the actual offender is unknown, the writ runs against 'the doer of the 
<A NAME="429"></A>deed'. The King and the tribe-kings also hear the cases in which the guilt 
<A NAME="430"></A>rests on inanimate objects and the lower animal.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="431"></A><B>Part 58</B>

<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>The Polemarch performs the sacrifices to Artemis the huntress and 
<A NAME="433"></A>to Enyalius, and arranges the contest at the funeral of those who have 
<A NAME="434"></A>fallen in war, and makes offerings to the memory of Harmodius and Aristogeiton. 
<A NAME="435"></A>Only private actions come before him, namely those in which resident aliens, 
<A NAME="436"></A>both ordinary and privileged, and agents of foreign states are concerned. 
<A NAME="437"></A>It is his duty to receive these cases and divide them into ten groups, 
<A NAME="438"></A>and assign to each tribe the group which comes to it by lot; after which 
<A NAME="439"></A>the magistrates who introduce cases for the tribe hand them over to the 
<A NAME="440"></A>Arbitrators. The Polemarch, however, brings up in person cases in which 
<A NAME="441"></A>an alien is charged with deserting his patron or neglecting to provide 
<A NAME="442"></A>himself with one, and also of inheritances and wards of state where aliens 
<A NAME="443"></A>are concerned; and in fact, generally, whatever the Archon does for citizens, 
<A NAME="444"></A>the Polemarch does for aliens.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="445"></A><B>Part 59</B>

<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR>The Thesmothetae in the first place have the power of prescribing 
<A NAME="447"></A>on what days the lawcourts are to sit, and next of assigning them to the 
<A NAME="448"></A>several magistrates; for the latter must follow the arrangement which the 
<A NAME="449"></A>Thesmothetae assign. Moreover they introduce impeachments before the Assembly, 
<A NAME="450"></A>and bring up all votes for removal from office, challenges of a magistrate's 
<A NAME="451"></A>conduct before the Assembly, indictments for illegal proposals, or for 
<A NAME="452"></A>proposing a law which is contrary to the interests of the state, complaints 
<A NAME="453"></A>against Proedri or their president for their conduct in office, and the 
<A NAME="454"></A>accounts presented by the generals. All indictments also come before them 
<A NAME="455"></A>in which a deposit has to be made by the prosecutor, namely, indictments 
<A NAME="456"></A>for concealment of foreign origin, for corrupt evasion of foreign origin 
<A NAME="457"></A>(when a man escapes the disqualification by bribery), for blackmailing 
<A NAME="458"></A>accusations, bribery, false entry of another as a state debtor, false testimony 
<A NAME="459"></A>to the service of a summons, conspiracy to enter a man as a state debtor, 
<A NAME="460"></A>corrupt removal from the list of debtors, and adultery. They also bring 
<A NAME="461"></A>up the examinations of all magistrates, and the rejections by the demes 
<A NAME="462"></A>and the condemnations by the Council. Moreover they bring up certain private 
<A NAME="463"></A>suits in cases of merchandise and mines, or where a slave has slandered 
<A NAME="464"></A>a free man. It is they also who cast lots to assign the courts to the various 
<A NAME="465"></A>magistrates, whether for private or public cases. They ratify commercial 
<A NAME="466"></A>treaties, and bring up the cases which arise out of such treaties; and 
<A NAME="467"></A>they also bring up cases of perjury from the Areopagus. The casting of 
<A NAME="468"></A>lots for the jurors is conducted by all the nine Archons, with the clerk 
<A NAME="469"></A>to the Thesmothetae as the tenth, each performing the duty for his own 
<A NAME="470"></A>tribe. Such are the duties of the nine Archons.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="471"></A><B>Part 60</B>

<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>There are also ten Commissioners of Games (Athlothetae), elected 
<A NAME="473"></A>by lot, one from each tribe. These officers, after passing an examination, 
<A NAME="474"></A>serve for four years; and they manage the Panathenaic procession, the contest 
<A NAME="475"></A>in music and that in gymnastic, and the horse-race; they also provide the 
<A NAME="476"></A>robe of Athena and, in conjunction with the Council, the vases, and they 
<A NAME="477"></A>present the oil to the athletes. This oil is collected from the sacred 
<A NAME="478"></A>olives. The Archon requisitions it from the owners of the farms on which 
<A NAME="479"></A>the sacred olives grow, at the rate of three-quarters of a pint from each 
<A NAME="480"></A>plant. Formerly the state used to sell the fruit itself, and if any one 
<A NAME="481"></A>dug up or broke down one of the sacred olives, he was tried by the Council 
<A NAME="482"></A>of Areopagus, and if he was condemned, the penalty was death. Since, however, 
<A NAME="483"></A>the oil has been paid by the owner of the farm, the procedure has lapsed, 
<A NAME="484"></A>though the law remains; and the oil is a state charge upon the property 
<A NAME="485"></A>instead of being taken from the individual plants. When, then, the Archon 
<A NAME="486"></A>has collected the oil for his year of office, he hands it over to the Treasurers 
<A NAME="487"></A>to preserve in the Acropolis, and he may not take his seat in the Areopagus 
<A NAME="488"></A>until he has paid over to the Treasurers the full amount. The Treasurers 
<A NAME="489"></A>keep it in the Acropolis until the Panathenaea, when they measure it out 
<A NAME="490"></A>to the Commissioners of Games, and they again to the victorious competitors. 
<A NAME="491"></A>The prizes for the victors in the musical contest consist of silver and 
<A NAME="492"></A>gold, for the victors in manly vigour, of shields, and for the victors 
<A NAME="493"></A>in the gymnastic contest and the horse-race, of oil.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="494"></A><B>Part 61</B>

<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>All officers connected with military service are elected by open 
<A NAME="496"></A>vote. In the first place, ten Generals (Strategi), who were formerly elected 
<A NAME="497"></A>one from each tribe, but now are chosen from the whole mass of citizens. 
<A NAME="498"></A>Their duties are assigned to them by open vote; one is appointed to command 
<A NAME="499"></A>the heavy infantry, and leads them if they go out to war; one to the defence 
<A NAME="500"></A>of the country, who remains on the defensive, and fights if there is war 
<A NAME="501"></A>within the borders of the country; two to Piraeus, one of whom is assigned 
<A NAME="502"></A>to Munichia, and one to the south shore, and these have charge of the defence 
<A NAME="503"></A>of the Piraeus; and one to superintend the symmories, who nominates the 
<A NAME="504"></A>trierarchs arranges exchanges of properties for them, and brings up actions 
<A NAME="505"></A>to decide on rival claims in connexion with them. The rest are dispatched 
<A NAME="506"></A>to whatever business may be on hand at the moment. The appointment of these 
<A NAME="507"></A>officers is submitted for confirmation in each prytany, when the question 
<A NAME="508"></A>is put whether they are considered to be doing their duty. If any officer 
<A NAME="509"></A>is rejected on this vote, he is tried in the lawcourt, and if he is found 
<A NAME="510"></A>guilty the people decide what punishment or fine shall be inflicted on 
<A NAME="511"></A>him; but if he is acquitted he resumes his office. The Generals have full 
<A NAME="512"></A>power, when on active service, to arrest any one for insubordination, or 
<A NAME="513"></A>to cashier him publicly, or to inflict a fine; the latter is, however, 
<A NAME="514"></A>unusual.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR>There are also ten Taxiarchs, one from each tribe, elected by open 
<A NAME="516"></A>vote; and each commands his own tribesmen and appoints captains of companies 
<A NAME="517"></A>(Lochagi). There are also two Hipparchs, elected by open vote from the 
<A NAME="518"></A>whole mass of the citizens, who command the cavalry, each taking five tribes. 
<A NAME="519"></A>They have the same powers as the Generals have in respect of the infantry, 
<A NAME="520"></A>and their appointments are also subject to confirmation. There are also 
<A NAME="521"></A>ten Phylarchs, elected by open vote, one from each tribe, to command the 
<A NAME="522"></A>cavalry, as the Taxiarchs do the infantry. There is also a Hipparch for 
<A NAME="523"></A>Lemnos, elected by open vote, who has charge of the cavalry in Lemnos. 
<A NAME="524"></A>There is also a treasurer of the Paralus, and another of the Ammonias, 
<A NAME="525"></A>similarly elected.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="526"></A><B>Part 62</B>

<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>Of the magistrates elected by lot, in former times some including 
<A NAME="528"></A>the nine Archons, were elected out of the tribe as a whole, while others, 
<A NAME="529"></A>namely those who are now elected in the Theseum, were apportioned among 
<A NAME="530"></A>the demes; but since the demes used to sell the elections, these magistrates 
<A NAME="531"></A>too are now elected from the whole tribe, except the members of the Council 
<A NAME="532"></A>and the guards of the dockyards, who are still left to the 
<A NAME="533"></A>demes.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>Pay is received for the following services. First the members of 
<A NAME="535"></A>the Assembly receive a drachma for the ordinary meetings, and nine obols 
<A NAME="536"></A>for the 'sovereign' meeting. Then the jurors at the law-courts receive 
<A NAME="537"></A>three obols; and the members of the Council five obols. They Prytanes receive 
<A NAME="538"></A>an allowance of an obol for their maintenance. The nine Archons receive 
<A NAME="539"></A>four obols apiece for maintenance, and also keep a herald and a flute-player; 
<A NAME="540"></A>and the Archon for Salamis receives a drachma a day. The Commissioners 
<A NAME="541"></A>for Games dine in the Prytaneum during the month of Hecatombaeon in which 
<A NAME="542"></A>the Panathenaic festival takes place, from the fourteenth day onwards. 
<A NAME="543"></A>The Amphictyonic deputies to Delos receive a drachma a day from the exchequer 
<A NAME="544"></A>of Delos. Also all magistrates sent to Samos, Scyros, Lemnos, or Imbros 
<A NAME="545"></A>receive an allowance for their maintenance. The military offices may be 
<A NAME="546"></A>held any number of times, but none of the others more than once, except 
<A NAME="547"></A>the membership of the Council, which may be held twice.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="548"></A><B>Part 63</B>

<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>The juries for the law-courts are chosen by lot by the nine Archons, 
<A NAME="550"></A>each for their own tribe, and by the clerk to the Thesmothetae for the 
<A NAME="551"></A>tenth. There are ten entrances into the courts, one for each tribe; twenty 
<A NAME="552"></A>rooms in which the lots are drawn, two for each tribe; a hundred chests, 
<A NAME="553"></A>ten for each tribe; other chests, in which are placed the tickets of the 
<A NAME="554"></A>jurors on whom the lot falls; and two vases. Further, staves, equal in 
<A NAME="555"></A>number to the jurors required, are placed by the side of each entrance; 
<A NAME="556"></A>and counters are put into one vase, equal in number to the staves. These 
<A NAME="557"></A>are inscribed with letters of the alphabet beginning with the eleventh 
<A NAME="558"></A>(lambda), equal in number to the courts which require to be filled. All 
<A NAME="559"></A>persons above thirty years of age are qualified to serve as jurors, provided 
<A NAME="560"></A>they are not debtors to the state and have not lost their civil rights. 
<A NAME="561"></A>If any unqualified person serves as juror, an information is laid against 
<A NAME="562"></A>him, and he is brought before the court; and, if he is convicted, the jurors 
<A NAME="563"></A>assess the punishment or fine which they consider him to deserve. If he 
<A NAME="564"></A>is condemned to a money fine, he must be imprisoned until he has paid up 
<A NAME="565"></A>both the original debt, on account of which the information was laid against 
<A NAME="566"></A>him, and also the fine which the court as imposed upon him. Each juror 
<A NAME="567"></A>has his ticket of boxwood, on which is inscribed his name, with the name 
<A NAME="568"></A>of his father and his deme, and one of the letters of the alphabet up to 
<A NAME="569"></A>kappa; for the jurors in their several tribes are divided into ten sections, 
<A NAME="570"></A>with approximately an equal number in each letter. When the Thesmothetes 
<A NAME="571"></A>has decided by lot which letters are required to attend at the courts, 
<A NAME="572"></A>the servant puts up above each court the letter which has been assigned 
<A NAME="573"></A>to it by the lot.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="574"></A><B>Part 64</B>

<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR>The ten chests above mentioned are placed in front of the entrance 
<A NAME="576"></A>used by each tribe, and are inscribed with the letters of the alphabet 
<A NAME="577"></A>from alpha to kappa. The jurors cast in their tickets, each into the chest 
<A NAME="578"></A>on which is inscribed the letter which is on his ticket; then the servant 
<A NAME="579"></A>shakes them all up, and the Archon draws one ticket from each chest. The 
<A NAME="580"></A>individual so selected is called the Ticket-hanger (Empectes), and his 
<A NAME="581"></A>function is to hang up the tickets out of his chest on the bar which bears 
<A NAME="582"></A>the same letter as that on the chest. He is chosen by lot, lest, if the 
<A NAME="583"></A>Ticket-hanger were always the same person, he might tamper with the results. 
<A NAME="584"></A>There are five of these bars in each of the rooms assigned for the lot-drawing. 
<A NAME="585"></A>Then the Archon casts in the dice and thereby chooses the jurors from each 
<A NAME="586"></A>tribe, room by room. The dice are made of brass, coloured black or white; 
<A NAME="587"></A>and according to the number of jurors required, so many white dice are 
<A NAME="588"></A>put in, one for each five tickets, while the remainder are black, in the 
<A NAME="589"></A>same proportion. As the Archon draws out the dice, the crier calls out 
<A NAME="590"></A>the names of the individuals chosen. The Ticket-hanger is included among 
<A NAME="591"></A>those selected. Each juror, as he is chosen and answers to his name, draws 
<A NAME="592"></A>a counter from the vase, and holding it out with the letter uppermost shows 
<A NAME="593"></A>it first to the presiding Archon; and he, when he has seen it, throws the 
<A NAME="594"></A>ticket of the juror into the chest on which is inscribed the letter which 
<A NAME="595"></A>is on the counter, so that the juror must go into the court assigned to 
<A NAME="596"></A>him by lot, and not into one chosen by himself, and that it may be impossible 
<A NAME="597"></A>for any one to collect the jurors of his choice into any particular court. 
<A NAME="598"></A>For this purpose chests are placed near the Archon, as many in number as 
<A NAME="599"></A>there are courts to be filled that day, bearing the letters of the courts 
<A NAME="600"></A>on which the lot has fallen.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="601"></A><B>Part 65</B>

<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR>The juror thereupon, after showing his counter again to the attendant, 
<A NAME="603"></A>passes through the barrier into the court. The attendant gives him a staff 
<A NAME="604"></A>of the same colour as the court bearing the letter which is on his counter, 
<A NAME="605"></A>so as to ensure his going into the court assigned to him by lot; since, 
<A NAME="606"></A>if he were to go into any other, he would be betrayed by the colour of 
<A NAME="607"></A>his staff. Each court has a certain colour painted on the lintel of the 
<A NAME="608"></A>entrance. Accordingly the juror, bearing his staff, enters the court which 
<A NAME="609"></A>has the same colour as his staff, and the same letter as his counter. As 
<A NAME="610"></A>he enters, he receives a voucher from the official to whom this duty has 
<A NAME="611"></A>been assigned by lot. So with their counters and their staves the selected 
<A NAME="612"></A>jurors take their seats in the court, having thus completed the process 
<A NAME="613"></A>of admission. The unsuccessful candidates receive back their tickets from 
<A NAME="614"></A>the Ticket-hangers. The public servants carry the chests from each tribe, 
<A NAME="615"></A>one to each court, containing the names of the members of the tribe who 
<A NAME="616"></A>are in that court, and hand them over to the officials assigned to the 
<A NAME="617"></A>duty of giving back their tickets to the jurors in each court, so that 
<A NAME="618"></A>these officials may call them up by name and pay them their 
<A NAME="619"></A>fee.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="620"></A><B>Part 66</B>

<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR>When all the courts are full, two ballot boxes are placed in the 
<A NAME="622"></A>first court, and a number of brazen dice, bearing the colours of the several 
<A NAME="623"></A>courts, and other dice inscribed with the names of the presiding magistrates. 
<A NAME="624"></A>Then two of the Thesmothetae, selected by lot, severally throw the dice 
<A NAME="625"></A>with the colours into one box, and those with the magistrates' names into 
<A NAME="626"></A>the other. The magistrate whose name is first drawn is thereupon proclaimed 
<A NAME="627"></A>by the crier as assigned for duty in the court which is first drawn, and 
<A NAME="628"></A>the second in the second, and similarly with the rest. The object of this 
<A NAME="629"></A>procedure is that no one may know which court he will have, but that each 
<A NAME="630"></A>may take the court assigned to him by lot.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>When the jurors have come in, and have been assigned to their respective 
<A NAME="632"></A>courts, the presiding magistrate in each court draws one ticket out of 
<A NAME="633"></A>each chest (making ten in all, one out of each tribe), and throws them 
<A NAME="634"></A>into another empty chest. He then draws out five of them, and assigns one 
<A NAME="635"></A>to the superintendence of the water-clock, and the other four to the telling 
<A NAME="636"></A>of the votes. This is to prevent any tampering beforehand with either the 
<A NAME="637"></A>superintendent of the clock or the tellers of the votes, and to secure 
<A NAME="638"></A>that there is no malpractice in these respects. The five who have not been 
<A NAME="639"></A>selected for these duties receive from them a statement of the order in 
<A NAME="640"></A>which the jurors shall receive their fees, and of the places where the 
<A NAME="641"></A>several tribes shall respectively gather in the court for this purpose 
<A NAME="642"></A>when their duties are completed; the object being that the jurors may be 
<A NAME="643"></A>broken up into small groups for the reception of their pay, and not all 
<A NAME="644"></A>crowd together and impede one another.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="645"></A><B>Part 67</B>

<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>These preliminaries being concluded, the cases are called on. If 
<A NAME="647"></A>it is a day for private cases, the private litigants are called. Four cases 
<A NAME="648"></A>are taken in each of the categories defined in the law, and the litigants 
<A NAME="649"></A>swear to confine their speeches to the point at issue. If it is a day for 
<A NAME="650"></A>public causes, the public litigants are called, and only one case is tried. 
<A NAME="651"></A>Water-clocks are provided, having small supply-tubes, into which the water 
<A NAME="652"></A>is poured by which the length of the pleadings is regulated. Ten gallons 
<A NAME="653"></A>are allowed for a case in which an amount of more than five thousand drachmas 
<A NAME="654"></A>is involved, and three for the second speech on each side. When the amount 
<A NAME="655"></A>is between one and five thousand drachmas, seven gallons are allowed for 
<A NAME="656"></A>the first speech and two for the second; when it is less than one thousand, 
<A NAME="657"></A>five and two. Six gallons are allowed for arbitrations between rival claimants, 
<A NAME="658"></A>in which there is no second speech. The official chosen by lot to superintend 
<A NAME="659"></A>the water-clock places his hand on the supply tube whenever the clerk is 
<A NAME="660"></A>about to read a resolution or law or affidavit or treaty. When, however, 
<A NAME="661"></A>a case is conducted according to a set measurement of the day, he does 
<A NAME="662"></A>not stop the supply, but each party receives an equal allowance of water. 
<A NAME="663"></A>The standard of measurement is the length of the days in the month Poseideon.... 
<A NAME="664"></A>The measured day is employed in cases when imprisonment, death, exile, 
<A NAME="665"></A>loss of civil rights, or confiscation of goods is assigned as the 
<A NAME="666"></A>penalty.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="667"></A><B>Part 68</B>

<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR>Most of the courts consist of 500 members...; and when it is necessary 
<A NAME="669"></A>to bring public cases before a jury of 1,000 members, two courts combine 
<A NAME="670"></A>for the purpose, the most important cases of all are brought 1,500 jurors, 
<A NAME="671"></A>or three courts. The ballot balls are made of brass with stems running 
<A NAME="672"></A>through the centre, half of them having the stem pierced and the other 
<A NAME="673"></A>half solid. When the speeches are concluded, the officials assigned to 
<A NAME="674"></A>the taking of the votes give each juror two ballot balls, one pierced and 
<A NAME="675"></A>one solid. This is done in full view of the rival litigants, to secure 
<A NAME="676"></A>that no one shall receive two pierced or two solid balls. Then the official 
<A NAME="677"></A>designated for the purpose takes away the jurors staves, in return for 
<A NAME="678"></A>which each one as he records his vote receives a brass voucher market with 
<A NAME="679"></A>the numeral 3 (because he gets three obols when he gives it up). This is 
<A NAME="680"></A>to ensure that all shall vote; since no one can get a voucher unless he 
<A NAME="681"></A>votes. Two urns, one of brass and the other of wood, stand in the court, 
<A NAME="682"></A>in distinct spots so that no one may surreptitiously insert ballot balls; 
<A NAME="683"></A>in these the jurors record their votes. The brazen urn is for effective 
<A NAME="684"></A>votes, the wooden for unused votes; and the brazen urn has a lid pierced 
<A NAME="685"></A>so as to take only one ballot ball, in order that no one may put in two 
<A NAME="686"></A>at a time.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR>When the jurors are about to vote, the crier demands first whether 
<A NAME="688"></A>the litigants enter a protest against any of the evidence; for no protest 
<A NAME="689"></A>can be received after the voting has begun. Then he proclaims again, 'The 
<A NAME="690"></A>pierced ballot for the plaintiff, the solid for the defendant'; and the 
<A NAME="691"></A>juror, taking his two ballot balls from the stand, with his hand closed 
<A NAME="692"></A>over the stem so as not to show either the pierced or the solid ballot 
<A NAME="693"></A>to the litigants, casts the one which is to count into the brazen urn, 
<A NAME="694"></A>and the other into the wooden urn.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="695"></A><B>Part 69</B>

<A NAME="696"></A><BR><BR>When all the jurors have voted, the attendants take the urn containing 
<A NAME="697"></A>the effective votes and discharge them on to a reckoning board having as 
<A NAME="698"></A>many cavities as there are ballot balls, so that the effective votes, whether 
<A NAME="699"></A>pierced or solid, may be plainly displayed and easily counted. Then the 
<A NAME="700"></A>officials assigned to the taking of the votes tell them off on the board, 
<A NAME="701"></A>the solid in one place and the pierced in another, and the crier announces 
<A NAME="702"></A>the numbers of the votes, the pierced ballots being for the prosecutor 
<A NAME="703"></A>and the solid for the defendant. Whichever has the majority is victorious; 
<A NAME="704"></A>but if the votes are equal the verdict is for the defendant. Each juror 
<A NAME="705"></A>receives two ballots, and uses one to record his vote, and throws the other 
<A NAME="706"></A>away.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR>Then, if damages have to be awarded, they vote again in the same 
<A NAME="708"></A>way, first returning their pay-vouchers and receiving back their staves. 
<A NAME="709"></A> Half a gallon of water is allowed to each party for the discussion of 
<A NAME="710"></A>the damages.  Finally, when all has been completed in accordance with the 
<A NAME="711"></A>law, the jurors receive their pay in the order assigned by the 
<A NAME="712"></A>lot.
