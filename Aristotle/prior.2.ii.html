<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>We have already explained the number of the figures, the character and 
<A NAME="12"></A>number of the premisses, when and how a syllogism is formed; further what 
<A NAME="13"></A>we must look for when a refuting and establishing propositions, and how 
<A NAME="14"></A>we should investigate a given problem in any branch of inquiry, also by 
<A NAME="15"></A>what means we shall obtain principles appropriate to each subject. Since 
<A NAME="16"></A>some syllogisms are universal, others particular, all the universal syllogisms 
<A NAME="17"></A>give more than one result, and of particular syllogisms the affirmative 
<A NAME="18"></A>yield more than one, the negative yield only the stated conclusion. For 
<A NAME="19"></A>all propositions are convertible save only the particular negative: and 
<A NAME="20"></A>the conclusion states one definite thing about another definite thing. 
<A NAME="21"></A>Consequently all syllogisms save the particular negative yield more than 
<A NAME="22"></A>one conclusion, e.g. if A has been proved to to all or to some B, then 
<A NAME="23"></A>B must belong to some A: and if A has been proved to belong to no B, then 
<A NAME="24"></A>B belongs to no A. This is a different conclusion from the former. But 
<A NAME="25"></A>if A does not belong to some B, it is not necessary that B should not belong 
<A NAME="26"></A>to some A: for it may possibly belong to all A.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>This then is the reason common to all syllogisms whether universal 
<A NAME="28"></A>or particular. But it is possible to give another reason concerning those 
<A NAME="29"></A>which are universal. For all the things that are subordinate to the middle 
<A NAME="30"></A>term or to the conclusion may be proved by the same syllogism, if the former 
<A NAME="31"></A>are placed in the middle, the latter in the conclusion; e.g. if the conclusion 
<A NAME="32"></A>AB is proved through C, whatever is subordinate to B or C must accept the 
<A NAME="33"></A>predicate A: for if D is included in B as in a whole, and B is included 
<A NAME="34"></A>in A, then D will be included in A. Again if E is included in C as in a 
<A NAME="35"></A>whole, and C is included in A, then E will be included in A. Similarly 
<A NAME="36"></A>if the syllogism is negative. In the second figure it will be possible 
<A NAME="37"></A>to infer only that which is subordinate to the conclusion, e.g. if A belongs 
<A NAME="38"></A>to no B and to all C; we conclude that B belongs to no C. If then D is 
<A NAME="39"></A>subordinate to C, clearly B does not belong to it. But that B does not 
<A NAME="40"></A>belong to what is subordinate to A is not clear by means of the syllogism. 
<A NAME="41"></A>And yet B does not belong to E, if E is subordinate to A. But while it 
<A NAME="42"></A>has been proved through the syllogism that B belongs to no C, it has been 
<A NAME="43"></A>assumed without proof that B does not belong to A, consequently it does 
<A NAME="44"></A>not result through the syllogism that B does not belong to 
<A NAME="45"></A>E.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>But in particular syllogisms there will be no necessity of inferring 
<A NAME="47"></A>what is subordinate to the conclusion (for a syllogism does not result 
<A NAME="48"></A>when this premiss is particular), but whatever is subordinate to the middle 
<A NAME="49"></A>term may be inferred, not however through the syllogism, e.g. if A belongs 
<A NAME="50"></A>to all B and B to some C. Nothing can be inferred about that which is subordinate 
<A NAME="51"></A>to C; something can be inferred about that which is subordinate to B, but 
<A NAME="52"></A>not through the preceding syllogism. Similarly in the other figures. That 
<A NAME="53"></A>which is subordinate to the conclusion cannot be proved; the other subordinate 
<A NAME="54"></A>can be proved, only not through the syllogism, just as in the universal 
<A NAME="55"></A>syllogisms what is subordinate to the middle term is proved (as we saw) 
<A NAME="56"></A>from a premiss which is not demonstrated: consequently either a conclusion 
<A NAME="57"></A>is not possible in the case of universal syllogisms or else it is possible 
<A NAME="58"></A>also in the case of particular syllogisms.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="59"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>It is possible for the premisses of the syllogism to be true, or 
<A NAME="61"></A>to be false, or to be the one true, the other false. The conclusion is 
<A NAME="62"></A>either true or false necessarily. From true premisses it is not possible 
<A NAME="63"></A>to draw a false conclusion, but a true conclusion may be drawn from false 
<A NAME="64"></A>premisses, true however only in respect to the fact, not to the reason. 
<A NAME="65"></A>The reason cannot be established from false premisses: why this is so will 
<A NAME="66"></A>be explained in the sequel.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>First then that it is not possible to draw a false conclusion from 
<A NAME="68"></A>true premisses, is made clear by this consideration. If it is necessary 
<A NAME="69"></A>that B should be when A is, it is necessary that A should not be when B 
<A NAME="70"></A>is not. If then A is true, B must be true: otherwise it will turn out that 
<A NAME="71"></A>the same thing both is and is not at the same time. But this is impossible. 
<A NAME="72"></A>Let it not, because A is laid down as a single term, be supposed that it 
<A NAME="73"></A>is possible, when a single fact is given, that something should necessarily 
<A NAME="74"></A>result. For that is not possible. For what results necessarily is the conclusion, 
<A NAME="75"></A>and the means by which this comes about are at the least three terms, and 
<A NAME="76"></A>two relations of subject and predicate or premisses. If then it is true 
<A NAME="77"></A>that A belongs to all that to which B belongs, and that B belongs to all 
<A NAME="78"></A>that to which C belongs, it is necessary that A should belong to all that 
<A NAME="79"></A>to which C belongs, and this cannot be false: for then the same thing will 
<A NAME="80"></A>belong and not belong at the same time. So A is posited as one thing, being 
<A NAME="81"></A>two premisses taken together. The same holds good of negative syllogisms: 
<A NAME="82"></A>it is not possible to prove a false conclusion from true 
<A NAME="83"></A>premisses.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>But from what is false a true conclusion may be drawn, whether 
<A NAME="85"></A>both the premisses are false or only one, provided that this is not either 
<A NAME="86"></A>of the premisses indifferently, if it is taken as wholly false: but if 
<A NAME="87"></A>the premiss is not taken as wholly false, it does not matter which of the 
<A NAME="88"></A>two is false. (1) Let A belong to the whole of C, but to none of the Bs, 
<A NAME="89"></A>neither let B belong to C. This is possible, e.g. animal belongs to no 
<A NAME="90"></A>stone, nor stone to any man. If then A is taken to belong to all B and 
<A NAME="91"></A>B to all C, A will belong to all C; consequently though both the premisses 
<A NAME="92"></A>are false the conclusion is true: for every man is an animal. Similarly 
<A NAME="93"></A>with the negative. For it is possible that neither A nor B should belong 
<A NAME="94"></A>to any C, although A belongs to all B, e.g. if the same terms are taken 
<A NAME="95"></A>and man is put as middle: for neither animal nor man belongs to any stone, 
<A NAME="96"></A>but animal belongs to every man. Consequently if one term is taken to belong 
<A NAME="97"></A>to none of that to which it does belong, and the other term is taken to 
<A NAME="98"></A>belong to all of that to which it does not belong, though both the premisses 
<A NAME="99"></A>are false the conclusion will be true. (2) A similar proof may be given 
<A NAME="100"></A>if each premiss is partially false.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>(3) But if one only of the premisses is false, when the first premiss 
<A NAME="102"></A>is wholly false, e.g. AB, the conclusion will not be true, but if the premiss 
<A NAME="103"></A>BC is wholly false, a true conclusion will be possible. I mean by 'wholly 
<A NAME="104"></A>false' the contrary of the truth, e.g. if what belongs to none is assumed 
<A NAME="105"></A>to belong to all, or if what belongs to all is assumed to belong to none. 
<A NAME="106"></A>Let A belong to no B, and B to all C. If then the premiss BC which I take 
<A NAME="107"></A>is true, and the premiss AB is wholly false, viz. that A belongs to all 
<A NAME="108"></A>B, it is impossible that the conclusion should be true: for A belonged 
<A NAME="109"></A>to none of the Cs, since A belonged to nothing to which B belonged, and 
<A NAME="110"></A>B belonged to all C. Similarly there cannot be a true conclusion if A belongs 
<A NAME="111"></A>to all B, and B to all C, but while the true premiss BC is assumed, the 
<A NAME="112"></A>wholly false premiss AB is also assumed, viz. that A belongs to nothing 
<A NAME="113"></A>to which B belongs: here the conclusion must be false. For A will belong 
<A NAME="114"></A>to all C, since A belongs to everything to which B belongs, and B to all 
<A NAME="115"></A>C. It is clear then that when the first premiss is wholly false, whether 
<A NAME="116"></A>affirmative or negative, and the other premiss is true, the conclusion 
<A NAME="117"></A>cannot be true.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>(4) But if the premiss is not wholly false, a true conclusion is 
<A NAME="119"></A>possible. For if A belongs to all C and to some B, and if B belongs to 
<A NAME="120"></A>all C, e.g. animal to every swan and to some white thing, and white to 
<A NAME="121"></A>every swan, then if we take as premisses that A belongs to all B, and B 
<A NAME="122"></A>to all C, A will belong to all C truly: for every swan is an animal. Similarly 
<A NAME="123"></A>if the statement AB is negative. For it is possible that A should belong 
<A NAME="124"></A>to some B and to no C, and that B should belong to all C, e.g. animal to 
<A NAME="125"></A>some white thing, but to no snow, and white to all snow. If then one should 
<A NAME="126"></A>assume that A belongs to no B, and B to all C, then will belong to no 
<A NAME="127"></A>C.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>(5) But if the premiss AB, which is assumed, is wholly true, and 
<A NAME="129"></A>the premiss BC is wholly false, a true syllogism will be possible: for 
<A NAME="130"></A>nothing prevents A belonging to all B and to all C, though B belongs to 
<A NAME="131"></A>no C, e.g. these being species of the same genus which are not subordinate 
<A NAME="132"></A>one to the other: for animal belongs both to horse and to man, but horse 
<A NAME="133"></A>to no man. If then it is assumed that A belongs to all B and B to all C, 
<A NAME="134"></A>the conclusion will be true, although the premiss BC is wholly false. Similarly 
<A NAME="135"></A>if the premiss AB is negative. For it is possible that A should belong 
<A NAME="136"></A>neither to any B nor to any C, and that B should not belong to any C, e.g. 
<A NAME="137"></A>a genus to species of another genus: for animal belongs neither to music 
<A NAME="138"></A>nor to the art of healing, nor does music belong to the art of healing. 
<A NAME="139"></A>If then it is assumed that A belongs to no B, and B to all C, the conclusion 
<A NAME="140"></A>will be true.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>(6) And if the premiss BC is not wholly false but in part only, 
<A NAME="142"></A>even so the conclusion may be true. For nothing prevents A belonging to 
<A NAME="143"></A>the whole of B and of C, while B belongs to some C, e.g. a genus to its 
<A NAME="144"></A>species and difference: for animal belongs to every man and to every footed 
<A NAME="145"></A>thing, and man to some footed things though not to all. If then it is assumed 
<A NAME="146"></A>that A belongs to all B, and B to all C, A will belong to all C: and this 
<A NAME="147"></A>ex hypothesi is true. Similarly if the premiss AB is negative. For it is 
<A NAME="148"></A>possible that A should neither belong to any B nor to any C, though B belongs 
<A NAME="149"></A>to some C, e.g. a genus to the species of another genus and its difference: 
<A NAME="150"></A>for animal neither belongs to any wisdom nor to any instance of 'speculative', 
<A NAME="151"></A>but wisdom belongs to some instance of 'speculative'. If then it should 
<A NAME="152"></A>be assumed that A belongs to no B, and B to all C, will belong to no C: 
<A NAME="153"></A>and this ex hypothesi is true.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>In particular syllogisms it is possible when the first premiss 
<A NAME="155"></A>is wholly false, and the other true, that the conclusion should be true; 
<A NAME="156"></A>also when the first premiss is false in part, and the other true; and when 
<A NAME="157"></A>the first is true, and the particular is false; and when both are false. 
<A NAME="158"></A>(7) For nothing prevents A belonging to no B, but to some C, and B to some 
<A NAME="159"></A>C, e.g. animal belongs to no snow, but to some white thing, and snow to 
<A NAME="160"></A>some white thing. If then snow is taken as middle, and animal as first 
<A NAME="161"></A>term, and it is assumed that A belongs to the whole of B, and B to some 
<A NAME="162"></A>C, then the premiss BC is wholly false, the premiss BC true, and the conclusion 
<A NAME="163"></A>true. Similarly if the premiss AB is negative: for it is possible that 
<A NAME="164"></A>A should belong to the whole of B, but not to some C, although B belongs 
<A NAME="165"></A>to some C, e.g. animal belongs to every man, but does not follow some white, 
<A NAME="166"></A>but man belongs to some white; consequently if man be taken as middle term 
<A NAME="167"></A>and it is assumed that A belongs to no B but B belongs to some C, the conclusion 
<A NAME="168"></A>will be true although the premiss AB is wholly false. (If the premiss AB 
<A NAME="169"></A>is false in part, the conclusion may be true. For nothing prevents A belonging 
<A NAME="170"></A>both to B and to some C, and B belonging to some C, e.g. animal to something 
<A NAME="171"></A>beautiful and to something great, and beautiful belonging to something 
<A NAME="172"></A>great. If then A is assumed to belong to all B, and B to some C, the a 
<A NAME="173"></A>premiss AB will be partially false, the premiss BC will be true, and the 
<A NAME="174"></A>conclusion true. Similarly if the premiss AB is negative. For the same 
<A NAME="175"></A>terms will serve, and in the same positions, to prove the 
<A NAME="176"></A>point.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>(9) Again if the premiss AB is true, and the premiss BC is false, 
<A NAME="178"></A>the conclusion may be true. For nothing prevents A belonging to the whole 
<A NAME="179"></A>of B and to some C, while B belongs to no C, e.g. animal to every swan 
<A NAME="180"></A>and to some black things, though swan belongs to no black thing. Consequently 
<A NAME="181"></A>if it should be assumed that A belongs to all B, and B to some C, the conclusion 
<A NAME="182"></A>will be true, although the statement Bc is false. Similarly if the premiss 
<A NAME="183"></A>AB is negative. For it is possible that A should belong to no B, and not 
<A NAME="184"></A>to some C, while B belongs to no C, e.g. a genus to the species of another 
<A NAME="185"></A>genus and to the accident of its own species: for animal belongs to no 
<A NAME="186"></A>number and not to some white things, and number belongs to nothing white. 
<A NAME="187"></A>If then number is taken as middle, and it is assumed that A belongs to 
<A NAME="188"></A>no B, and B to some C, then A will not belong to some C, which ex hypothesi 
<A NAME="189"></A>is true. And the premiss AB is true, the premiss BC 
<A NAME="190"></A>false.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>(10) Also if the premiss AB is partially false, and the premiss 
<A NAME="192"></A>BC is false too, the conclusion may be true. For nothing prevents A belonging 
<A NAME="193"></A>to some B and to some C, though B belongs to no C, e.g. if B is the contrary 
<A NAME="194"></A>of C, and both are accidents of the same genus: for animal belongs to some 
<A NAME="195"></A>white things and to some black things, but white belongs to no black thing. 
<A NAME="196"></A>If then it is assumed that A belongs to all B, and B to some C, the conclusion 
<A NAME="197"></A>will be true. Similarly if the premiss AB is negative: for the same terms 
<A NAME="198"></A>arranged in the same way will serve for the proof.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>(11) Also though both premisses are false the conclusion may be 
<A NAME="200"></A>true. For it is possible that A may belong to no B and to some C, while 
<A NAME="201"></A>B belongs to no C, e.g. a genus in relation to the species of another genus, 
<A NAME="202"></A>and to the accident of its own species: for animal belongs to no number, 
<A NAME="203"></A>but to some white things, and number to nothing white. If then it is assumed 
<A NAME="204"></A>that A belongs to all B and B to some C, the conclusion will be true, though 
<A NAME="205"></A>both premisses are false. Similarly also if the premiss AB is negative. 
<A NAME="206"></A>For nothing prevents A belonging to the whole of B, and not to some C, 
<A NAME="207"></A>while B belongs to no C, e.g. animal belongs to every swan, and not to 
<A NAME="208"></A>some black things, and swan belongs to nothing black. Consequently if it 
<A NAME="209"></A>is assumed that A belongs to no B, and B to some C, then A does not belong 
<A NAME="210"></A>to some C. The conclusion then is true, but the premisses arc 
<A NAME="211"></A>false.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="212"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>In the middle figure it is possible in every way to reach a true 
<A NAME="214"></A>conclusion through false premisses, whether the syllogisms are universal 
<A NAME="215"></A>or particular, viz. when both premisses are wholly false; when each is 
<A NAME="216"></A>partially false; when one is true, the other wholly false (it does not 
<A NAME="217"></A>matter which of the two premisses is false); if both premisses are partially 
<A NAME="218"></A>false; if one is quite true, the other partially false; if one is wholly 
<A NAME="219"></A>false, the other partially true. For (1) if A belongs to no B and to all 
<A NAME="220"></A>C, e.g. animal to no stone and to every horse, then if the premisses are 
<A NAME="221"></A>stated contrariwise and it is assumed that A belongs to all B and to no 
<A NAME="222"></A>C, though the premisses are wholly false they will yield a true conclusion. 
<A NAME="223"></A>Similarly if A belongs to all B and to no C: for we shall have the same 
<A NAME="224"></A>syllogism.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>(2) Again if one premiss is wholly false, the other wholly true: 
<A NAME="226"></A>for nothing prevents A belonging to all B and to all C, though B belongs 
<A NAME="227"></A>to no C, e.g. a genus to its co-ordinate species. For animal belongs to 
<A NAME="228"></A>every horse and man, and no man is a horse. If then it is assumed that 
<A NAME="229"></A>animal belongs to all of the one, and none of the other, the one premiss 
<A NAME="230"></A>will be wholly false, the other wholly true, and the conclusion will be 
<A NAME="231"></A>true whichever term the negative statement concerns.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>(3) Also if one premiss is partially false, the other wholly true. 
<A NAME="233"></A>For it is possible that A should belong to some B and to all C, though 
<A NAME="234"></A>B belongs to no C, e.g. animal to some white things and to every raven, 
<A NAME="235"></A>though white belongs to no raven. If then it is assumed that A belongs 
<A NAME="236"></A>to no B, but to the whole of C, the premiss AB is partially false, the 
<A NAME="237"></A>premiss AC wholly true, and the conclusion true. Similarly if the negative 
<A NAME="238"></A>statement is transposed: the proof can be made by means of the same terms. 
<A NAME="239"></A>Also if the affirmative premiss is partially false, the negative wholly 
<A NAME="240"></A>true, a true conclusion is possible. For nothing prevents A belonging to 
<A NAME="241"></A>some B, but not to C as a whole, while B belongs to no C, e.g. animal belongs 
<A NAME="242"></A>to some white things, but to no pitch, and white belongs to no pitch. Consequently 
<A NAME="243"></A>if it is assumed that A belongs to the whole of B, but to no C, the premiss 
<A NAME="244"></A>AB is partially false, the premiss AC is wholly true, and the conclusion 
<A NAME="245"></A>is true.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>(4) And if both the premisses are partially false, the conclusion 
<A NAME="247"></A>may be true. For it is possible that A should belong to some B and to some 
<A NAME="248"></A>C, and B to no C, e.g. animal to some white things and to some black things, 
<A NAME="249"></A>though white belongs to nothing black. If then it is assumed that A belongs 
<A NAME="250"></A>to all B and to no C, both premisses are partially false, but the conclusion 
<A NAME="251"></A>is true. Similarly, if the negative premiss is transposed, the proof can 
<A NAME="252"></A>be made by means of the same terms.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>It is clear also that our thesis holds in particular syllogisms. 
<A NAME="254"></A>For (5) nothing prevents A belonging to all B and to some C, though B does 
<A NAME="255"></A>not belong to some C, e.g. animal to every man and to some white things, 
<A NAME="256"></A>though man will not belong to some white things. If then it is stated that 
<A NAME="257"></A>A belongs to no B and to some C, the universal premiss is wholly false, 
<A NAME="258"></A>the particular premiss is true, and the conclusion is true. Similarly if 
<A NAME="259"></A>the premiss AB is affirmative: for it is possible that A should belong 
<A NAME="260"></A>to no B, and not to some C, though B does not belong to some C, e.g. animal 
<A NAME="261"></A>belongs to nothing lifeless, and does not belong to some white things, 
<A NAME="262"></A>and lifeless will not belong to some white things. If then it is stated 
<A NAME="263"></A>that A belongs to all B and not to some C, the premiss AB which is universal 
<A NAME="264"></A>is wholly false, the premiss AC is true, and the conclusion is true. Also 
<A NAME="265"></A>a true conclusion is possible when the universal premiss is true, and the 
<A NAME="266"></A>particular is false. For nothing prevents A following neither B nor C at 
<A NAME="267"></A>all, while B does not belong to some C, e.g. animal belongs to no number 
<A NAME="268"></A>nor to anything lifeless, and number does not follow some lifeless things. 
<A NAME="269"></A>If then it is stated that A belongs to no B and to some C, the conclusion 
<A NAME="270"></A>will be true, and the universal premiss true, but the particular false. 
<A NAME="271"></A>Similarly if the premiss which is stated universally is affirmative. For 
<A NAME="272"></A>it is possible that should A belong both to B and to C as wholes, though 
<A NAME="273"></A>B does not follow some C, e.g. a genus in relation to its species and difference: 
<A NAME="274"></A>for animal follows every man and footed things as a whole, but man does 
<A NAME="275"></A>not follow every footed thing. Consequently if it is assumed that A belongs 
<A NAME="276"></A>to the whole of B, but does not belong to some C, the universal premiss 
<A NAME="277"></A>is true, the particular false, and the conclusion true.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>(6) It is clear too that though both premisses are false they may 
<A NAME="279"></A>yield a true conclusion, since it is possible that A should belong both 
<A NAME="280"></A>to B and to C as wholes, though B does not follow some C. For if it is 
<A NAME="281"></A>assumed that A belongs to no B and to some C, the premisses are both false, 
<A NAME="282"></A>but the conclusion is true. Similarly if the universal premiss is affirmative 
<A NAME="283"></A>and the particular negative. For it is possible that A should follow no 
<A NAME="284"></A>B and all C, though B does not belong to some C, e.g. animal follows no 
<A NAME="285"></A>science but every man, though science does not follow every man. If then 
<A NAME="286"></A>A is assumed to belong to the whole of B, and not to follow some C, the 
<A NAME="287"></A>premisses are false but the conclusion is true.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="288"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>In the last figure a true conclusion may come through what is false, 
<A NAME="290"></A>alike when both premisses are wholly false, when each is partly false, 
<A NAME="291"></A>when one premiss is wholly true, the other false, when one premiss is partly 
<A NAME="292"></A>false, the other wholly true, and vice versa, and in every other way in 
<A NAME="293"></A>which it is possible to alter the premisses. For (1) nothing prevents neither 
<A NAME="294"></A>A nor B from belonging to any C, while A belongs to some B, e.g. neither 
<A NAME="295"></A>man nor footed follows anything lifeless, though man belongs to some footed 
<A NAME="296"></A>things. If then it is assumed that A and B belong to all C, the premisses 
<A NAME="297"></A>will be wholly false, but the conclusion true. Similarly if one premiss 
<A NAME="298"></A>is negative, the other affirmative. For it is possible that B should belong 
<A NAME="299"></A>to no C, but A to all C, and that should not belong to some B, e.g. black 
<A NAME="300"></A>belongs to no swan, animal to every swan, and animal not to everything 
<A NAME="301"></A>black. Consequently if it is assumed that B belongs to all C, and A to 
<A NAME="302"></A>no C, A will not belong to some B: and the conclusion is true, though the 
<A NAME="303"></A>premisses are false.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>(2) Also if each premiss is partly false, the conclusion may be 
<A NAME="305"></A>true. For nothing prevents both A and B from belonging to some C while 
<A NAME="306"></A>A belongs to some B, e.g. white and beautiful belong to some animals, and 
<A NAME="307"></A>white to some beautiful things. If then it is stated that A and B belong 
<A NAME="308"></A>to all C, the premisses are partially false, but the conclusion is true. 
<A NAME="309"></A>Similarly if the premiss AC is stated as negative. For nothing prevents 
<A NAME="310"></A>A from not belonging, and B from belonging, to some C, while A does not 
<A NAME="311"></A>belong to all B, e.g. white does not belong to some animals, beautiful 
<A NAME="312"></A>belongs to some animals, and white does not belong to everything beautiful. 
<A NAME="313"></A>Consequently if it is assumed that A belongs to no C, and B to all C, both 
<A NAME="314"></A>premisses are partly false, but the conclusion is true.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>(3) Similarly if one of the premisses assumed is wholly false, 
<A NAME="316"></A>the other wholly true. For it is possible that both A and B should follow 
<A NAME="317"></A>all C, though A does not belong to some B, e.g. animal and white follow 
<A NAME="318"></A>every swan, though animal does not belong to everything white. Taking these 
<A NAME="319"></A>then as terms, if one assumes that B belongs to the whole of C, but A does 
<A NAME="320"></A>not belong to C at all, the premiss BC will be wholly true, the premiss 
<A NAME="321"></A>AC wholly false, and the conclusion true. Similarly if the statement BC 
<A NAME="322"></A>is false, the statement AC true, the conclusion may be true. The same terms 
<A NAME="323"></A>will serve for the proof. Also if both the premisses assumed are affirmative, 
<A NAME="324"></A>the conclusion may be true. For nothing prevents B from following all C, 
<A NAME="325"></A>and A from not belonging to C at all, though A belongs to some B, e.g. 
<A NAME="326"></A>animal belongs to every swan, black to no swan, and black to some animals. 
<A NAME="327"></A>Consequently if it is assumed that A and B belong to every C, the premiss 
<A NAME="328"></A>BC is wholly true, the premiss AC is wholly false, and the conclusion is 
<A NAME="329"></A>true. Similarly if the premiss AC which is assumed is true: the proof can 
<A NAME="330"></A>be made through the same terms.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>(4) Again if one premiss is wholly true, the other partly false, 
<A NAME="332"></A>the conclusion may be true. For it is possible that B should belong to 
<A NAME="333"></A>all C, and A to some C, while A belongs to some B, e.g. biped belongs to 
<A NAME="334"></A>every man, beautiful not to every man, and beautiful to some bipeds. If 
<A NAME="335"></A>then it is assumed that both A and B belong to the whole of C, the premiss 
<A NAME="336"></A>BC is wholly true, the premiss AC partly false, the conclusion true. Similarly 
<A NAME="337"></A>if of the premisses assumed AC is true and BC partly false, a true conclusion 
<A NAME="338"></A>is possible: this can be proved, if the same terms as before are transposed. 
<A NAME="339"></A>Also the conclusion may be true if one premiss is negative, the other affirmative. 
<A NAME="340"></A>For since it is possible that B should belong to the whole of C, and A 
<A NAME="341"></A>to some C, and, when they are so, that A should not belong to all B, therefore 
<A NAME="342"></A>it is assumed that B belongs to the whole of C, and A to no C, the negative 
<A NAME="343"></A>premiss is partly false, the other premiss wholly true, and the conclusion 
<A NAME="344"></A>is true. Again since it has been proved that if A belongs to no C and B 
<A NAME="345"></A>to some C, it is possible that A should not belong to some C, it is clear 
<A NAME="346"></A>that if the premiss AC is wholly true, and the premiss BC partly false, 
<A NAME="347"></A>it is possible that the conclusion should be true. For if it is assumed 
<A NAME="348"></A>that A belongs to no C, and B to all C, the premiss AC is wholly true, 
<A NAME="349"></A>and the premiss BC is partly false.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>(5) It is clear also in the case of particular syllogisms that 
<A NAME="351"></A>a true conclusion may come through what is false, in every possible way. 
<A NAME="352"></A>For the same terms must be taken as have been taken when the premisses 
<A NAME="353"></A>are universal, positive terms in positive syllogisms, negative terms in 
<A NAME="354"></A>negative. For it makes no difference to the setting out of the terms, whether 
<A NAME="355"></A>one assumes that what belongs to none belongs to all or that what belongs 
<A NAME="356"></A>to some belongs to all. The same applies to negative 
<A NAME="357"></A>statements.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then that if the conclusion is false, the premisses 
<A NAME="359"></A>of the argument must be false, either all or some of them; but when the 
<A NAME="360"></A>conclusion is true, it is not necessary that the premisses should be true, 
<A NAME="361"></A>either one or all, yet it is possible, though no part of the syllogism 
<A NAME="362"></A>is true, that the conclusion may none the less be true; but it is not necessitated. 
<A NAME="363"></A>The reason is that when two things are so related to one another, that 
<A NAME="364"></A>if the one is, the other necessarily is, then if the latter is not, the 
<A NAME="365"></A>former will not be either, but if the latter is, it is not necessary that 
<A NAME="366"></A>the former should be. But it is impossible that the same thing should be 
<A NAME="367"></A>necessitated by the being and by the not-being of the same thing. I mean, 
<A NAME="368"></A>for example, that it is impossible that B should necessarily be great since 
<A NAME="369"></A>A is white and that B should necessarily be great since A is not white. 
<A NAME="370"></A>For whenever since this, A, is white it is necessary that that, B, should 
<A NAME="371"></A>be great, and since B is great that C should not be white, then it is necessary 
<A NAME="372"></A>if is white that C should not be white. And whenever it is necessary, since 
<A NAME="373"></A>one of two things is, that the other should be, it is necessary, if the 
<A NAME="374"></A>latter is not, that the former (viz. A) should not be. If then B is not 
<A NAME="375"></A>great A cannot be white. But if, when A is not white, it is necessary that 
<A NAME="376"></A>B should be great, it necessarily results that if B is not great, B itself 
<A NAME="377"></A>is great. (But this is impossible.) For if B is not great, A will necessarily 
<A NAME="378"></A>not be white. If then when this is not white B must be great, it results 
<A NAME="379"></A>that if B is not great, it is great, just as if it were proved through 
<A NAME="380"></A>three terms.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="381"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>Circular and reciprocal proof means proof by means of the conclusion, 
<A NAME="383"></A>i.e. by converting one of the premisses simply and inferring the premiss 
<A NAME="384"></A>which was assumed in the original syllogism: e.g. suppose it has been necessary 
<A NAME="385"></A>to prove that A belongs to all C, and it has been proved through B; suppose 
<A NAME="386"></A>that A should now be proved to belong to B by assuming that A belongs to 
<A NAME="387"></A>C, and C to B-so A belongs to B: but in the first syllogism the converse 
<A NAME="388"></A>was assumed, viz. that B belongs to C. Or suppose it is necessary to prove 
<A NAME="389"></A>that B belongs to C, and A is assumed to belong to C, which was the conclusion 
<A NAME="390"></A>of the first syllogism, and B to belong to A but the converse was assumed 
<A NAME="391"></A>in the earlier syllogism, viz. that A belongs to B. In no other way is 
<A NAME="392"></A>reciprocal proof possible. If another term is taken as middle, the proof 
<A NAME="393"></A>is not circular: for neither of the propositions assumed is the same as 
<A NAME="394"></A>before: if one of the accepted terms is taken as middle, only one of the 
<A NAME="395"></A>premisses of the first syllogism can be assumed in the second: for if both 
<A NAME="396"></A>of them are taken the same conclusion as before will result: but it must 
<A NAME="397"></A>be different. If the terms are not convertible, one of the premisses from 
<A NAME="398"></A>which the syllogism results must be undemonstrated: for it is not possible 
<A NAME="399"></A>to demonstrate through these terms that the third belongs to the middle 
<A NAME="400"></A>or the middle to the first. If the terms are convertible, it is possible 
<A NAME="401"></A>to demonstrate everything reciprocally, e.g. if A and B and C are convertible 
<A NAME="402"></A>with one another. Suppose the proposition AC has been demonstrated through 
<A NAME="403"></A>B as middle term, and again the proposition AB through the conclusion and 
<A NAME="404"></A>the premiss BC converted, and similarly the proposition BC through the 
<A NAME="405"></A>conclusion and the premiss AB converted. But it is necessary to prove both 
<A NAME="406"></A>the premiss CB, and the premiss BA: for we have used these alone without 
<A NAME="407"></A>demonstrating them. If then it is assumed that B belongs to all C, and 
<A NAME="408"></A>C to all A, we shall have a syllogism relating B to A. Again if it is assumed 
<A NAME="409"></A>that C belongs to all A, and A to all B, C must belong to all B. In both 
<A NAME="410"></A>these syllogisms the premiss CA has been assumed without being demonstrated: 
<A NAME="411"></A>the other premisses had ex hypothesi been proved. Consequently if we succeed 
<A NAME="412"></A>in demonstrating this premiss, all the premisses will have been proved 
<A NAME="413"></A>reciprocally. If then it is assumed that C belongs to all B, and B to all 
<A NAME="414"></A>A, both the premisses assumed have been proved, and C must belong to A. 
<A NAME="415"></A>It is clear then that only if the terms are convertible is circular and 
<A NAME="416"></A>reciprocal demonstration possible (if the terms are not convertible, the 
<A NAME="417"></A>matter stands as we said above). But it turns out in these also that we 
<A NAME="418"></A>use for the demonstration the very thing that is being proved: for C is 
<A NAME="419"></A>proved of B, and B of by assuming that C is said of and C is proved of 
<A NAME="420"></A>A through these premisses, so that we use the conclusion for the 
<A NAME="421"></A>demonstration.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>In negative syllogisms reciprocal proof is as follows. Let B belong 
<A NAME="423"></A>to all C, and A to none of the Bs: we conclude that A belongs to none of 
<A NAME="424"></A>the Cs. If again it is necessary to prove that A belongs to none of the 
<A NAME="425"></A>Bs (which was previously assumed) A must belong to no C, and C to all B: 
<A NAME="426"></A>thus the previous premiss is reversed. If it is necessary to prove that 
<A NAME="427"></A>B belongs to C, the proposition AB must no longer be converted as before: 
<A NAME="428"></A>for the premiss 'B belongs to no A' is identical with the premiss 'A belongs 
<A NAME="429"></A>to no B'. But we must assume that B belongs to all of that to none of which 
<A NAME="430"></A>longs. Let A belong to none of the Cs (which was the previous conclusion) 
<A NAME="431"></A>and assume that B belongs to all of that to none of which A belongs. It 
<A NAME="432"></A>is necessary then that B should belong to all C. Consequently each of the 
<A NAME="433"></A>three propositions has been made a conclusion, and this is circular demonstration, 
<A NAME="434"></A>to assume the conclusion and the converse of one of the premisses, and 
<A NAME="435"></A>deduce the remaining premiss.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>In particular syllogisms it is not possible to demonstrate the 
<A NAME="437"></A>universal premiss through the other propositions, but the particular premiss 
<A NAME="438"></A>can be demonstrated. Clearly it is impossible to demonstrate the universal 
<A NAME="439"></A>premiss: for what is universal is proved through propositions which are 
<A NAME="440"></A>universal, but the conclusion is not universal, and the proof must start 
<A NAME="441"></A>from the conclusion and the other premiss. Further a syllogism cannot be 
<A NAME="442"></A>made at all if the other premiss is converted: for the result is that both 
<A NAME="443"></A>premisses are particular. But the particular premiss may be proved. Suppose 
<A NAME="444"></A>that A has been proved of some C through B. If then it is assumed that 
<A NAME="445"></A>B belongs to all A and the conclusion is retained, B will belong to some 
<A NAME="446"></A>C: for we obtain the first figure and A is middle. But if the syllogism 
<A NAME="447"></A>is negative, it is not possible to prove the universal premiss, for the 
<A NAME="448"></A>reason given above. But it is possible to prove the particular premiss, 
<A NAME="449"></A>if the proposition AB is converted as in the universal syllogism, i.e 'B 
<A NAME="450"></A>belongs to some of that to some of which A does not belong': otherwise 
<A NAME="451"></A>no syllogism results because the particular premiss is 
<A NAME="452"></A>negative.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="453"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>In the second figure it is not possible to prove an affirmative 
<A NAME="455"></A>proposition in this way, but a negative proposition may be proved. An affirmative 
<A NAME="456"></A>proposition is not proved because both premisses of the new syllogism are 
<A NAME="457"></A>not affirmative (for the conclusion is negative) but an affirmative proposition 
<A NAME="458"></A>is (as we saw) proved from premisses which are both affirmative. The negative 
<A NAME="459"></A>is proved as follows. Let A belong to all B, and to no C: we conclude that 
<A NAME="460"></A>B belongs to no C. If then it is assumed that B belongs to all A, it is 
<A NAME="461"></A>necessary that A should belong to no C: for we get the second figure, with 
<A NAME="462"></A>B as middle. But if the premiss AB was negative, and the other affirmative, 
<A NAME="463"></A>we shall have the first figure. For C belongs to all A and B to no C, consequently 
<A NAME="464"></A>B belongs to no A: neither then does A belong to B. Through the conclusion, 
<A NAME="465"></A>therefore, and one premiss, we get no syllogism, but if another premiss 
<A NAME="466"></A>is assumed in addition, a syllogism will be possible. But if the syllogism 
<A NAME="467"></A>not universal, the universal premiss cannot be proved, for the same reason 
<A NAME="468"></A>as we gave above, but the particular premiss can be proved whenever the 
<A NAME="469"></A>universal statement is affirmative. Let A belong to all B, and not to all 
<A NAME="470"></A>C: the conclusion is BC. If then it is assumed that B belongs to all A, 
<A NAME="471"></A>but not to all C, A will not belong to some C, B being middle. But if the 
<A NAME="472"></A>universal premiss is negative, the premiss AC will not be demonstrated 
<A NAME="473"></A>by the conversion of AB: for it turns out that either both or one of the 
<A NAME="474"></A>premisses is negative; consequently a syllogism will not be possible. But 
<A NAME="475"></A>the proof will proceed as in the universal syllogisms, if it is assumed 
<A NAME="476"></A>that A belongs to some of that to some of which B does not 
<A NAME="477"></A>belong.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="478"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>In the third figure, when both premisses are taken universally, 
<A NAME="480"></A>it is not possible to prove them reciprocally: for that which is universal 
<A NAME="481"></A>is proved through statements which are universal, but the conclusion in 
<A NAME="482"></A>this figure is always particular, so that it is clear that it is not possible 
<A NAME="483"></A>at all to prove through this figure the universal premiss. But if one premiss 
<A NAME="484"></A>is universal, the other particular, proof of the latter will sometimes 
<A NAME="485"></A>be possible, sometimes not. When both the premisses assumed are affirmative, 
<A NAME="486"></A>and the universal concerns the minor extreme, proof will be possible, but 
<A NAME="487"></A>when it concerns the other extreme, impossible. Let A belong to all C and 
<A NAME="488"></A>B to some C: the conclusion is the statement AB. If then it is assumed 
<A NAME="489"></A>that C belongs to all A, it has been proved that C belongs to some B, but 
<A NAME="490"></A>that B belongs to some C has not been proved. And yet it is necessary, 
<A NAME="491"></A>if C belongs to some B, that B should belong to some C. But it is not the 
<A NAME="492"></A>same that this should belong to that, and that to this: but we must assume 
<A NAME="493"></A>besides that if this belongs to some of that, that belongs to some of this. 
<A NAME="494"></A>But if this is assumed the syllogism no longer results from the conclusion 
<A NAME="495"></A>and the other premiss. But if B belongs to all C, and A to some C, it will 
<A NAME="496"></A>be possible to prove the proposition AC, when it is assumed that C belongs 
<A NAME="497"></A>to all B, and A to some B. For if C belongs to all B and A to some B, it 
<A NAME="498"></A>is necessary that A should belong to some C, B being middle. And whenever 
<A NAME="499"></A>one premiss is affirmative the other negative, and the affirmative is universal, 
<A NAME="500"></A>the other premiss can be proved. Let B belong to all C, and A not to some 
<A NAME="501"></A>C: the conclusion is that A does not belong to some B. If then it is assumed 
<A NAME="502"></A>further that C belongs to all B, it is necessary that A should not belong 
<A NAME="503"></A>to some C, B being middle. But when the negative premiss is universal, 
<A NAME="504"></A>the other premiss is not except as before, viz. if it is assumed that that 
<A NAME="505"></A>belongs to some of that, to some of which this does not belong, e.g. if 
<A NAME="506"></A>A belongs to no C, and B to some C: the conclusion is that A does not belong 
<A NAME="507"></A>to some B. If then it is assumed that C belongs to some of that to some 
<A NAME="508"></A>of which does not belong, it is necessary that C should belong to some 
<A NAME="509"></A>of the Bs. In no other way is it possible by converting the universal premiss 
<A NAME="510"></A>to prove the other: for in no other way can a syllogism be 
<A NAME="511"></A>formed.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then that in the first figure reciprocal proof is made 
<A NAME="513"></A>both through the third and through the first figure-if the conclusion is 
<A NAME="514"></A>affirmative through the first; if the conclusion is negative through the 
<A NAME="515"></A>last. For it is assumed that that belongs to all of that to none of which 
<A NAME="516"></A>this belongs. In the middle figure, when the syllogism is universal, proof 
<A NAME="517"></A>is possible through the second figure and through the first, but when particular 
<A NAME="518"></A>through the second and the last. In the third figure all proofs are made 
<A NAME="519"></A>through itself. It is clear also that in the third figure and in the middle 
<A NAME="520"></A>figure those syllogisms which are not made through those figures themselves 
<A NAME="521"></A>either are not of the nature of circular proof or are 
<A NAME="522"></A>imperfect.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="523"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>To convert a syllogism means to alter the conclusion and make another 
<A NAME="525"></A>syllogism to prove that either the extreme cannot belong to the middle 
<A NAME="526"></A>or the middle to the last term. For it is necessary, if the conclusion 
<A NAME="527"></A>has been changed into its opposite and one of the premisses stands, that 
<A NAME="528"></A>the other premiss should be destroyed. For if it should stand, the conclusion 
<A NAME="529"></A>also must stand. It makes a difference whether the conclusion is converted 
<A NAME="530"></A>into its contradictory or into its contrary. For the same syllogism does 
<A NAME="531"></A>not result whichever form the conversion takes. This will be made clear 
<A NAME="532"></A>by the sequel. By contradictory opposition I mean the opposition of 'to 
<A NAME="533"></A>all' to 'not to all', and of 'to some' to 'to none'; by contrary opposition 
<A NAME="534"></A>I mean the opposition of 'to all' to 'to none', and of 'to some' to 'not 
<A NAME="535"></A>to some'. Suppose that A been proved of C, through B as middle term. If 
<A NAME="536"></A>then it should be assumed that A belongs to no C, but to all B, B will 
<A NAME="537"></A>belong to no C. And if A belongs to no C, and B to all C, A will belong, 
<A NAME="538"></A>not to no B at all, but not to all B. For (as we saw) the universal is 
<A NAME="539"></A>not proved through the last figure. In a word it is not possible to refute 
<A NAME="540"></A>universally by conversion the premiss which concerns the major extreme: 
<A NAME="541"></A>for the refutation always proceeds through the third since it is necessary 
<A NAME="542"></A>to take both premisses in reference to the minor extreme. Similarly if 
<A NAME="543"></A>the syllogism is negative. Suppose it has been proved that A belongs to 
<A NAME="544"></A>no C through B. Then if it is assumed that A belongs to all C, and to no 
<A NAME="545"></A>B, B will belong to none of the Cs. And if A and B belong to all C, A will 
<A NAME="546"></A>belong to some B: but in the original premiss it belonged to no 
<A NAME="547"></A>B.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR>If the conclusion is converted into its contradictory, the syllogisms 
<A NAME="549"></A>will be contradictory and not universal. For one premiss is particular, 
<A NAME="550"></A>so that the conclusion also will be particular. Let the syllogism be affirmative, 
<A NAME="551"></A>and let it be converted as stated. Then if A belongs not to all C, but 
<A NAME="552"></A>to all B, B will belong not to all C. And if A belongs not to all C, but 
<A NAME="553"></A>B belongs to all C, A will belong not to all B. Similarly if the syllogism 
<A NAME="554"></A>is negative. For if A belongs to some C, and to no B, B will belong, not 
<A NAME="555"></A>to no C at all, but-not to some C. And if A belongs to some C, and B to 
<A NAME="556"></A>all C, as was originally assumed, A will belong to some 
<A NAME="557"></A>B.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>In particular syllogisms when the conclusion is converted into 
<A NAME="559"></A>its contradictory, both premisses may be refuted, but when it is converted 
<A NAME="560"></A>into its contrary, neither. For the result is no longer, as in the universal 
<A NAME="561"></A>syllogisms, refutation in which the conclusion reached by O, conversion 
<A NAME="562"></A>lacks universality, but no refutation at all. Suppose that A has been proved 
<A NAME="563"></A>of some C. If then it is assumed that A belongs to no C, and B to some 
<A NAME="564"></A>C, A will not belong to some B: and if A belongs to no C, but to all B, 
<A NAME="565"></A>B will belong to no C. Thus both premisses are refuted. But neither can 
<A NAME="566"></A>be refuted if the conclusion is converted into its contrary. For if A does 
<A NAME="567"></A>not belong to some C, but to all B, then B will not belong to some C. But 
<A NAME="568"></A>the original premiss is not yet refuted: for it is possible that B should 
<A NAME="569"></A>belong to some C, and should not belong to some C. The universal premiss 
<A NAME="570"></A>AB cannot be affected by a syllogism at all: for if A does not belong to 
<A NAME="571"></A>some of the Cs, but B belongs to some of the Cs, neither of the premisses 
<A NAME="572"></A>is universal. Similarly if the syllogism is negative: for if it should 
<A NAME="573"></A>be assumed that A belongs to all C, both premisses are refuted: but if 
<A NAME="574"></A>the assumption is that A belongs to some C, neither premiss is refuted. 
<A NAME="575"></A>The proof is the same as before.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="576"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR>In the second figure it is not possible to refute the premiss which 
<A NAME="578"></A>concerns the major extreme by establishing something contrary to it, whichever 
<A NAME="579"></A>form the conversion of the conclusion may take. For the conclusion of the 
<A NAME="580"></A>refutation will always be in the third figure, and in this figure (as we 
<A NAME="581"></A>saw) there is no universal syllogism. The other premiss can be refuted 
<A NAME="582"></A>in a manner similar to the conversion: I mean, if the conclusion of the 
<A NAME="583"></A>first syllogism is converted into its contrary, the conclusion of the refutation 
<A NAME="584"></A>will be the contrary of the minor premiss of the first, if into its contradictory, 
<A NAME="585"></A>the contradictory. Let A belong to all B and to no C: conclusion BC. If 
<A NAME="586"></A>then it is assumed that B belongs to all C, and the proposition AB stands, 
<A NAME="587"></A>A will belong to all C, since the first figure is produced. If B belongs 
<A NAME="588"></A>to all C, and A to no C, then A belongs not to all B: the figure is the 
<A NAME="589"></A>last. But if the conclusion BC is converted into its contradictory, the 
<A NAME="590"></A>premiss AB will be refuted as before, the premiss, AC by its contradictory. 
<A NAME="591"></A>For if B belongs to some C, and A to no C, then A will not belong to some 
<A NAME="592"></A>B. Again if B belongs to some C, and A to all B, A will belong to some 
<A NAME="593"></A>C, so that the syllogism results in the contradictory of the minor premiss. 
<A NAME="594"></A>A similar proof can be given if the premisses are transposed in respect 
<A NAME="595"></A>of their quality.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>If the syllogism is particular, when the conclusion is converted 
<A NAME="597"></A>into its contrary neither premiss can be refuted, as also happened in the 
<A NAME="598"></A>first figure,' if the conclusion is converted into its contradictory, both 
<A NAME="599"></A>premisses can be refuted. Suppose that A belongs to no B, and to some C: 
<A NAME="600"></A>the conclusion is BC. If then it is assumed that B belongs to some C, and 
<A NAME="601"></A>the statement AB stands, the conclusion will be that A does not belong 
<A NAME="602"></A>to some C. But the original statement has not been refuted: for it is possible 
<A NAME="603"></A>that A should belong to some C and also not to some C. Again if B belongs 
<A NAME="604"></A>to some C and A to some C, no syllogism will be possible: for neither of 
<A NAME="605"></A>the premisses taken is universal. Consequently the proposition AB is not 
<A NAME="606"></A>refuted. But if the conclusion is converted into its contradictory, both 
<A NAME="607"></A>premisses can be refuted. For if B belongs to all C, and A to no B, A will 
<A NAME="608"></A>belong to no C: but it was assumed to belong to some C. Again if B belongs 
<A NAME="609"></A>to all C and A to some C, A will belong to some B. The same proof can be 
<A NAME="610"></A>given if the universal statement is affirmative.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="611"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>In the third figure when the conclusion is converted into its contrary, 
<A NAME="613"></A>neither of the premisses can be refuted in any of the syllogisms, but when 
<A NAME="614"></A>the conclusion is converted into its contradictory, both premisses may 
<A NAME="615"></A>be refuted and in all the moods. Suppose it has been proved that A belongs 
<A NAME="616"></A>to some B, C being taken as middle, and the premisses being universal. 
<A NAME="617"></A>If then it is assumed that A does not belong to some B, but B belongs to 
<A NAME="618"></A>all C, no syllogism is formed about A and C. Nor if A does not belong to 
<A NAME="619"></A>some B, but belongs to all C, will a syllogism be possible about B and 
<A NAME="620"></A>C. A similar proof can be given if the premisses are not universal. For 
<A NAME="621"></A>either both premisses arrived at by the conversion must be particular, 
<A NAME="622"></A>or the universal premiss must refer to the minor extreme. But we found 
<A NAME="623"></A>that no syllogism is possible thus either in the first or in the middle 
<A NAME="624"></A>figure. But if the conclusion is converted into its contradictory, both 
<A NAME="625"></A>the premisses can be refuted. For if A belongs to no B, and B to all C, 
<A NAME="626"></A>then A belongs to no C: again if A belongs to no B, and to all C, B belongs 
<A NAME="627"></A>to no C. And similarly if one of the premisses is not universal. For if 
<A NAME="628"></A>A belongs to no B, and B to some C, A will not belong to some C: if A belongs 
<A NAME="629"></A>to no B, and to C, B will belong to no C.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>Similarly if the original syllogism is negative. Suppose it has 
<A NAME="631"></A>been proved that A does not belong to some B, BC being affirmative, AC 
<A NAME="632"></A>being negative: for it was thus that, as we saw, a syllogism could be made. 
<A NAME="633"></A>Whenever then the contrary of the conclusion is assumed a syllogism will 
<A NAME="634"></A>not be possible. For if A belongs to some B, and B to all C, no syllogism 
<A NAME="635"></A>is possible (as we saw) about A and C. Nor, if A belongs to some B, and 
<A NAME="636"></A>to no C, was a syllogism possible concerning B and C. Therefore the premisses 
<A NAME="637"></A>are not refuted. But when the contradictory of the conclusion is assumed, 
<A NAME="638"></A>they are refuted. For if A belongs to all B, and B to C, A belongs to all 
<A NAME="639"></A>C: but A was supposed originally to belong to no C. Again if A belongs 
<A NAME="640"></A>to all B, and to no C, then B belongs to no C: but it was supposed to belong 
<A NAME="641"></A>to all C. A similar proof is possible if the premisses are not universal. 
<A NAME="642"></A>For AC becomes universal and negative, the other premiss particular and 
<A NAME="643"></A>affirmative. If then A belongs to all B, and B to some C, it results that 
<A NAME="644"></A>A belongs to some C: but it was supposed to belong to no C. Again if A 
<A NAME="645"></A>belongs to all B, and to no C, then B belongs to no C: but it was assumed 
<A NAME="646"></A>to belong to some C. If A belongs to some B and B to some C, no syllogism 
<A NAME="647"></A>results: nor yet if A belongs to some B, and to no C. Thus in one way the 
<A NAME="648"></A>premisses are refuted, in the other way they are not.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>From what has been said it is clear how a syllogism results in 
<A NAME="650"></A>each figure when the conclusion is converted; when a result contrary to 
<A NAME="651"></A>the premiss, and when a result contradictory to the premiss, is obtained. 
<A NAME="652"></A>It is clear that in the first figure the syllogisms are formed through 
<A NAME="653"></A>the middle and the last figures, and the premiss which concerns the minor 
<A NAME="654"></A>extreme is alway refuted through the middle figure, the premiss which concerns 
<A NAME="655"></A>the major through the last figure. In the second figure syllogisms proceed 
<A NAME="656"></A>through the first and the last figures, and the premiss which concerns 
<A NAME="657"></A>the minor extreme is always refuted through the first figure, the premiss 
<A NAME="658"></A>which concerns the major extreme through the last. In the third figure 
<A NAME="659"></A>the refutation proceeds through the first and the middle figures; the premiss 
<A NAME="660"></A>which concerns the major is always refuted through the first figure, the 
<A NAME="661"></A>premiss which concerns the minor through the middle 
<A NAME="662"></A>figure.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="663"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then what conversion is, how it is effected in each 
<A NAME="665"></A>figure, and what syllogism results. The syllogism per impossibile is proved 
<A NAME="666"></A>when the contradictory of the conclusion stated and another premiss is 
<A NAME="667"></A>assumed; it can be made in all the figures. For it resembles conversion, 
<A NAME="668"></A>differing only in this: conversion takes place after a syllogism has been 
<A NAME="669"></A>formed and both the premisses have been taken, but a reduction to the impossible 
<A NAME="670"></A>takes place not because the contradictory has been agreed to already, but 
<A NAME="671"></A>because it is clear that it is true. The terms are alike in both, and the 
<A NAME="672"></A>premisses of both are taken in the same way. For example if A belongs to 
<A NAME="673"></A>all B, C being middle, then if it is supposed that A does not belong to 
<A NAME="674"></A>all B or belongs to no B, but to all C (which was admitted to be true), 
<A NAME="675"></A>it follows that C belongs to no B or not to all B. But this is impossible: 
<A NAME="676"></A>consequently the supposition is false: its contradictory then is true. 
<A NAME="677"></A>Similarly in the other figures: for whatever moods admit of conversion 
<A NAME="678"></A>admit also of the reduction per impossibile.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>All the problems can be proved per impossibile in all the figures, 
<A NAME="680"></A>excepting the universal affirmative, which is proved in the middle and 
<A NAME="681"></A>third figures, but not in the first. Suppose that A belongs not to all 
<A NAME="682"></A>B, or to no B, and take besides another premiss concerning either of the 
<A NAME="683"></A>terms, viz. that C belongs to all A, or that B belongs to all D; thus we 
<A NAME="684"></A>get the first figure. If then it is supposed that A does not belong to 
<A NAME="685"></A>all B, no syllogism results whichever term the assumed premiss concerns; 
<A NAME="686"></A>but if it is supposed that A belongs to no B, when the premiss BD is assumed 
<A NAME="687"></A>as well we shall prove syllogistically what is false, but not the problem 
<A NAME="688"></A>proposed. For if A belongs to no B, and B belongs to all D, A belongs to 
<A NAME="689"></A>no D. Let this be impossible: it is false then A belongs to no B. But the 
<A NAME="690"></A>universal affirmative is not necessarily true if the universal negative 
<A NAME="691"></A>is false. But if the premiss CA is assumed as well, no syllogism results, 
<A NAME="692"></A>nor does it do so when it is supposed that A does not belong to all B. 
<A NAME="693"></A>Consequently it is clear that the universal affirmative cannot be proved 
<A NAME="694"></A>in the first figure per impossibile.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>But the particular affirmative and the universal and particular 
<A NAME="696"></A>negatives can all be proved. Suppose that A belongs to no B, and let it 
<A NAME="697"></A>have been assumed that B belongs to all or to some C. Then it is necessary 
<A NAME="698"></A>that A should belong to no C or not to all C. But this is impossible (for 
<A NAME="699"></A>let it be true and clear that A belongs to all C): consequently if this 
<A NAME="700"></A>is false, it is necessary that A should belong to some B. But if the other 
<A NAME="701"></A>premiss assumed relates to A, no syllogism will be possible. Nor can a 
<A NAME="702"></A>conclusion be drawn when the contrary of the conclusion is supposed, e.g. 
<A NAME="703"></A>that A does not belong to some B. Clearly then we must suppose the 
<A NAME="704"></A>contradictory.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR><BR>Again suppose that A belongs to some B, and let it have been assumed 
<A NAME="706"></A>that C belongs to all A. It is necessary then that C should belong to some 
<A NAME="707"></A>B. But let this be impossible, so that the supposition is false: in that 
<A NAME="708"></A>case it is true that A belongs to no B. We may proceed in the same way 
<A NAME="709"></A>if the proposition CA has been taken as negative. But if the premiss assumed 
<A NAME="710"></A>concerns B, no syllogism will be possible. If the contrary is supposed, 
<A NAME="711"></A>we shall have a syllogism and an impossible conclusion, but the problem 
<A NAME="712"></A>in hand is not proved. Suppose that A belongs to all B, and let it have 
<A NAME="713"></A>been assumed that C belongs to all A. It is necessary then that C should 
<A NAME="714"></A>belong to all B. But this is impossible, so that it is false that A belongs 
<A NAME="715"></A>to all B. But we have not yet shown it to be necessary that A belongs to 
<A NAME="716"></A>no B, if it does not belong to all B. Similarly if the other premiss taken 
<A NAME="717"></A>concerns B; we shall have a syllogism and a conclusion which is impossible, 
<A NAME="718"></A>but the hypothesis is not refuted. Therefore it is the contradictory that 
<A NAME="719"></A>we must suppose.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR>To prove that A does not belong to all B, we must suppose that 
<A NAME="721"></A>it belongs to all B: for if A belongs to all B, and C to all A, then C 
<A NAME="722"></A>belongs to all B; so that if this is impossible, the hypothesis is false. 
<A NAME="723"></A>Similarly if the other premiss assumed concerns B. The same results if 
<A NAME="724"></A>the original proposition CA was negative: for thus also we get a syllogism. 
<A NAME="725"></A>But if the negative proposition concerns B, nothing is proved. If the hypothesis 
<A NAME="726"></A>is that A belongs not to all but to some B, it is not proved that A belongs 
<A NAME="727"></A>not to all B, but that it belongs to no B. For if A belongs to some B, 
<A NAME="728"></A>and C to all A, then C will belong to some B. If then this is impossible, 
<A NAME="729"></A>it is false that A belongs to some B; consequently it is true that A belongs 
<A NAME="730"></A>to no B. But if this is proved, the truth is refuted as well; for the original 
<A NAME="731"></A>conclusion was that A belongs to some B, and does not belong to some B. 
<A NAME="732"></A>Further the impossible does not result from the hypothesis: for then the 
<A NAME="733"></A>hypothesis would be false, since it is impossible to draw a false conclusion 
<A NAME="734"></A>from true premisses: but in fact it is true: for A belongs to some B. Consequently 
<A NAME="735"></A>we must not suppose that A belongs to some B, but that it belongs to all 
<A NAME="736"></A>B. Similarly if we should be proving that A does not belong to some B: 
<A NAME="737"></A>for if 'not to belong to some' and 'to belong not to all' have the same 
<A NAME="738"></A>meaning, the demonstration of both will be identical.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then that not the contrary but the contradictory ought 
<A NAME="740"></A>to be supposed in all the syllogisms. For thus we shall have necessity 
<A NAME="741"></A>of inference, and the claim we make is one that will be generally accepted. 
<A NAME="742"></A>For if of everything one or other of two contradictory statements holds 
<A NAME="743"></A>good, then if it is proved that the negation does not hold, the affirmation 
<A NAME="744"></A>must be true. Again if it is not admitted that the affirmation is true, 
<A NAME="745"></A>the claim that the negation is true will be generally accepted. But in 
<A NAME="746"></A>neither way does it suit to maintain the contrary: for it is not necessary 
<A NAME="747"></A>that if the universal negative is false, the universal affirmative should 
<A NAME="748"></A>be true, nor is it generally accepted that if the one is false the other 
<A NAME="749"></A>is true.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="750"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then that in the first figure all problems except the 
<A NAME="752"></A>universal affirmative are proved per impossibile. But in the middle and 
<A NAME="753"></A>the last figures this also is proved. Suppose that A does not belong to 
<A NAME="754"></A>all B, and let it have been assumed that A belongs to all C. If then A 
<A NAME="755"></A>belongs not to all B, but to all C, C will not belong to all B. But this 
<A NAME="756"></A>is impossible (for suppose it to be clear that C belongs to all B): consequently 
<A NAME="757"></A>the hypothesis is false. It is true then that A belongs to all B. But if 
<A NAME="758"></A>the contrary is supposed, we shall have a syllogism and a result which 
<A NAME="759"></A>is impossible: but the problem in hand is not proved. For if A belongs 
<A NAME="760"></A>to no B, and to all C, C will belong to no B. This is impossible; so that 
<A NAME="761"></A>it is false that A belongs to no B. But though this is false, it does not 
<A NAME="762"></A>follow that it is true that A belongs to all B.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>When A belongs to some B, suppose that A belongs to no B, and let 
<A NAME="764"></A>A belong to all C. It is necessary then that C should belong to no B. Consequently, 
<A NAME="765"></A>if this is impossible, A must belong to some B. But if it is supposed that 
<A NAME="766"></A>A does not belong to some B, we shall have the same results as in the first 
<A NAME="767"></A>figure.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR><BR>Again suppose that A belongs to some B, and let A belong to no 
<A NAME="769"></A>C. It is necessary then that C should not belong to some B. But originally 
<A NAME="770"></A>it belonged to all B, consequently the hypothesis is false: A then will 
<A NAME="771"></A>belong to no B.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR><BR>When A does not belong to an B, suppose it does belong to all B, 
<A NAME="773"></A>and to no C. It is necessary then that C should belong to no B. But this 
<A NAME="774"></A>is impossible: so that it is true that A does not belong to all B. It is 
<A NAME="775"></A>clear then that all the syllogisms can be formed in the middle 
<A NAME="776"></A>figure.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="777"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR>Similarly they can all be formed in the last figure. Suppose that 
<A NAME="779"></A>A does not belong to some B, but C belongs to all B: then A does not belong 
<A NAME="780"></A>to some C. If then this is impossible, it is false that A does not belong 
<A NAME="781"></A>to some B; so that it is true that A belongs to all B. But if it is supposed 
<A NAME="782"></A>that A belongs to no B, we shall have a syllogism and a conclusion which 
<A NAME="783"></A>is impossible: but the problem in hand is not proved: for if the contrary 
<A NAME="784"></A>is supposed, we shall have the same results as before.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR>But to prove that A belongs to some B, this hypothesis must be 
<A NAME="786"></A>made. If A belongs to no B, and C to some B, A will belong not to all C. 
<A NAME="787"></A>If then this is false, it is true that A belongs to some 
<A NAME="788"></A>B.
<A NAME="789"></A><BR><BR>When A belongs to no B, suppose A belongs to some B, and let it 
<A NAME="790"></A>have been assumed that C belongs to all B. Then it is necessary that A 
<A NAME="791"></A>should belong to some C. But ex hypothesi it belongs to no C, so that it 
<A NAME="792"></A>is false that A belongs to some B. But if it is supposed that A belongs 
<A NAME="793"></A>to all B, the problem is not proved.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR><BR>But this hypothesis must be made if we are prove that A belongs 
<A NAME="795"></A>not to all B. For if A belongs to all B and C to some B, then A belongs 
<A NAME="796"></A>to some C. But this we assumed not to be so, so it is false that A belongs 
<A NAME="797"></A>to all B. But in that case it is true that A belongs not to all B. If however 
<A NAME="798"></A>it is assumed that A belongs to some B, we shall have the same result as 
<A NAME="799"></A>before.
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then that in all the syllogisms which proceed per impossibile 
<A NAME="801"></A>the contradictory must be assumed. And it is plain that in the middle figure 
<A NAME="802"></A>an affirmative conclusion, and in the last figure a universal conclusion, 
<A NAME="803"></A>are proved in a way.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="804"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>Demonstration per impossibile differs from ostensive proof in that 
<A NAME="806"></A>it posits what it wishes to refute by reduction to a statement admitted 
<A NAME="807"></A>to be false; whereas ostensive proof starts from admitted positions. Both, 
<A NAME="808"></A>indeed, take two premisses that are admitted, but the latter takes the 
<A NAME="809"></A>premisses from which the syllogism starts, the former takes one of these, 
<A NAME="810"></A>along with the contradictory of the original conclusion. Also in the ostensive 
<A NAME="811"></A>proof it is not necessary that the conclusion should be known, nor that 
<A NAME="812"></A>one should suppose beforehand that it is true or not: in the other it is 
<A NAME="813"></A>necessary to suppose beforehand that it is not true. It makes no difference 
<A NAME="814"></A>whether the conclusion is affirmative or negative; the method is the same 
<A NAME="815"></A>in both cases. Everything which is concluded ostensively can be proved 
<A NAME="816"></A>per impossibile, and that which is proved per impossibile can be proved 
<A NAME="817"></A>ostensively, through the same terms. Whenever the syllogism is formed in 
<A NAME="818"></A>the first figure, the truth will be found in the middle or the last figure, 
<A NAME="819"></A>if negative in the middle, if affirmative in the last. Whenever the syllogism 
<A NAME="820"></A>is formed in the middle figure, the truth will be found in the first, whatever 
<A NAME="821"></A>the problem may be. Whenever the syllogism is formed in the last figure, 
<A NAME="822"></A>the truth will be found in the first and middle figures, if affirmative 
<A NAME="823"></A>in first, if negative in the middle. Suppose that A has been proved to 
<A NAME="824"></A>belong to no B, or not to all B, through the first figure. Then the hypothesis 
<A NAME="825"></A>must have been that A belongs to some B, and the original premisses that 
<A NAME="826"></A>C belongs to all A and to no B. For thus the syllogism was made and the 
<A NAME="827"></A>impossible conclusion reached. But this is the middle figure, if C belongs 
<A NAME="828"></A>to all A and to no B. And it is clear from these premisses that A belongs 
<A NAME="829"></A>to no B. Similarly if has been proved not to belong to all B. For the hypothesis 
<A NAME="830"></A>is that A belongs to all B; and the original premisses are that C belongs 
<A NAME="831"></A>to all A but not to all B. Similarly too, if the premiss CA should be negative: 
<A NAME="832"></A>for thus also we have the middle figure. Again suppose it has been proved 
<A NAME="833"></A>that A belongs to some B. The hypothesis here is that is that A belongs 
<A NAME="834"></A>to no B; and the original premisses that B belongs to all C, and A either 
<A NAME="835"></A>to all or to some C: for in this way we shall get what is impossible. But 
<A NAME="836"></A>if A and B belong to all C, we have the last figure. And it is clear from 
<A NAME="837"></A>these premisses that A must belong to some B. Similarly if B or A should 
<A NAME="838"></A>be assumed to belong to some C.
<A NAME="839"></A><BR><BR>Again suppose it has been proved in the middle figure that A belongs 
<A NAME="840"></A>to all B. Then the hypothesis must have been that A belongs not to all 
<A NAME="841"></A>B, and the original premisses that A belongs to all C, and C to all B: 
<A NAME="842"></A>for thus we shall get what is impossible. But if A belongs to all C, and 
<A NAME="843"></A>C to all B, we have the first figure. Similarly if it has been proved that 
<A NAME="844"></A>A belongs to some B: for the hypothesis then must have been that A belongs 
<A NAME="845"></A>to no B, and the original premisses that A belongs to all C, and C to some 
<A NAME="846"></A>B. If the syllogism is negative, the hypothesis must have been that A belongs 
<A NAME="847"></A>to some B, and the original premisses that A belongs to no C, and C to 
<A NAME="848"></A>all B, so that the first figure results. If the syllogism is not universal, 
<A NAME="849"></A>but proof has been given that A does not belong to some B, we may infer 
<A NAME="850"></A>in the same way. The hypothesis is that A belongs to all B, the original 
<A NAME="851"></A>premisses that A belongs to no C, and C belongs to some B: for thus we 
<A NAME="852"></A>get the first figure.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR>Again suppose it has been proved in the third figure that A belongs 
<A NAME="854"></A>to all B. Then the hypothesis must have been that A belongs not to all 
<A NAME="855"></A>B, and the original premisses that C belongs to all B, and A belongs to 
<A NAME="856"></A>all C; for thus we shall get what is impossible. And the original premisses 
<A NAME="857"></A>form the first figure. Similarly if the demonstration establishes a particular 
<A NAME="858"></A>proposition: the hypothesis then must have been that A belongs to no B, 
<A NAME="859"></A>and the original premisses that C belongs to some B, and A to all C. If 
<A NAME="860"></A>the syllogism is negative, the hypothesis must have been that A belongs 
<A NAME="861"></A>to some B, and the original premisses that C belongs to no A and to all 
<A NAME="862"></A>B, and this is the middle figure. Similarly if the demonstration is not 
<A NAME="863"></A>universal. The hypothesis will then be that A belongs to all B, the premisses 
<A NAME="864"></A>that C belongs to no A and to some B: and this is the middle 
<A NAME="865"></A>figure.
<A NAME="866"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then that it is possible through the same terms to 
<A NAME="867"></A>prove each of the problems ostensively as well. Similarly it will be possible 
<A NAME="868"></A>if the syllogisms are ostensive to reduce them ad impossibile in the terms 
<A NAME="869"></A>which have been taken, whenever the contradictory of the conclusion of 
<A NAME="870"></A>the ostensive syllogism is taken as a premiss. For the syllogisms become 
<A NAME="871"></A>identical with those which are obtained by means of conversion, so that 
<A NAME="872"></A>we obtain immediately the figures through which each problem will be solved. 
<A NAME="873"></A>It is clear then that every thesis can be proved in both ways, i.e. per 
<A NAME="874"></A>impossibile and ostensively, and it is not possible to separate one method 
<A NAME="875"></A>from the other.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="876"></A><B>Part 15</B>

<A NAME="877"></A><BR><BR>In what figure it is possible to draw a conclusion from premisses 
<A NAME="878"></A>which are opposed, and in what figure this is not possible, will be made 
<A NAME="879"></A>clear in this way. Verbally four kinds of opposition are possible, viz. 
<A NAME="880"></A>universal affirmative to universal negative, universal affirmative to particular 
<A NAME="881"></A>negative, particular affirmative to universal negative, and particular 
<A NAME="882"></A>affirmative to particular negative: but really there are only three: for 
<A NAME="883"></A>the particular affirmative is only verbally opposed to the particular negative. 
<A NAME="884"></A>Of the genuine opposites I call those which are universal contraries, the 
<A NAME="885"></A>universal affirmative and the universal negative, e.g. 'every science is 
<A NAME="886"></A>good', 'no science is good'; the others I call contradictories.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR><BR>In the first figure no syllogism whether affirmative or negative 
<A NAME="888"></A>can be made out of opposed premisses: no affirmative syllogism is possible 
<A NAME="889"></A>because both premisses must be affirmative, but opposites are, the one 
<A NAME="890"></A>affirmative, the other negative: no negative syllogism is possible because 
<A NAME="891"></A>opposites affirm and deny the same predicate of the same subject, and the 
<A NAME="892"></A>middle term in the first figure is not predicated of both extremes, but 
<A NAME="893"></A>one thing is denied of it, and it is affirmed of something else: but such 
<A NAME="894"></A>premisses are not opposed.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR>In the middle figure a syllogism can be made both oLcontradictories 
<A NAME="896"></A>and of contraries. Let A stand for good, let B and C stand for science. 
<A NAME="897"></A>If then one assumes that every science is good, and no science is good, 
<A NAME="898"></A>A belongs to all B and to no C, so that B belongs to no C: no science then 
<A NAME="899"></A>is a science. Similarly if after taking 'every science is good' one took 
<A NAME="900"></A>'the science of medicine is not good'; for A belongs to all B but to no 
<A NAME="901"></A>C, so that a particular science will not be a science. Again, a particular 
<A NAME="902"></A>science will not be a science if A belongs to all C but to no B, and B 
<A NAME="903"></A>is science, C medicine, and A supposition: for after taking 'no science 
<A NAME="904"></A>is supposition', one has assumed that a particular science is supposition. 
<A NAME="905"></A>This syllogism differs from the preceding because the relations between 
<A NAME="906"></A>the terms are reversed: before, the affirmative statement concerned B, 
<A NAME="907"></A>now it concerns C. Similarly if one premiss is not universal: for the middle 
<A NAME="908"></A>term is always that which is stated negatively of one extreme, and affirmatively 
<A NAME="909"></A>of the other. Consequently it is possible that contradictories may lead 
<A NAME="910"></A>to a conclusion, though not always or in every mood, but only if the terms 
<A NAME="911"></A>subordinate to the middle are such that they are either identical or related 
<A NAME="912"></A>as whole to part. Otherwise it is impossible: for the premisses cannot 
<A NAME="913"></A>anyhow be either contraries or contradictories.
<A NAME="914"></A><BR><BR>In the third figure an affirmative syllogism can never be made 
<A NAME="915"></A>out of opposite premisses, for the reason given in reference to the first 
<A NAME="916"></A>figure; but a negative syllogism is possible whether the terms are universal 
<A NAME="917"></A>or not. Let B and C stand for science, A for medicine. If then one should 
<A NAME="918"></A>assume that all medicine is science and that no medicine is science, he 
<A NAME="919"></A>has assumed that B belongs to all A and C to no A, so that a particular 
<A NAME="920"></A>science will not be a science. Similarly if the premiss BA is not assumed 
<A NAME="921"></A>universally. For if some medicine is science and again no medicine is science, 
<A NAME="922"></A>it results that some science is not science, The premisses are contrary 
<A NAME="923"></A>if the terms are taken universally; if one is particular, they are 
<A NAME="924"></A>contradictory.
<A NAME="925"></A><BR><BR>We must recognize that it is possible to take opposites in the 
<A NAME="926"></A>way we said, viz. 'all science is good' and 'no science is good' or 'some 
<A NAME="927"></A>science is not good'. This does not usually escape notice. But it is possible 
<A NAME="928"></A>to establish one part of a contradiction through other premisses, or to 
<A NAME="929"></A>assume it in the way suggested in the Topics. Since there are three oppositions 
<A NAME="930"></A>to affirmative statements, it follows that opposite statements may be assumed 
<A NAME="931"></A>as premisses in six ways; we may have either universal affirmative and 
<A NAME="932"></A>negative, or universal affirmative and particular negative, or particular 
<A NAME="933"></A>affirmative and universal negative, and the relations between the terms 
<A NAME="934"></A>may be reversed; e.g. A may belong to all B and to no C, or to all C and 
<A NAME="935"></A>to no B, or to all of the one, not to all of the other; here too the relation 
<A NAME="936"></A>between the terms may be reversed. Similarly in the third figure. So it 
<A NAME="937"></A>is clear in how many ways and in what figures a syllogism can be made by 
<A NAME="938"></A>means of premisses which are opposed.
<A NAME="939"></A><BR><BR>It is clear too that from false premisses it is possible to draw 
<A NAME="940"></A>a true conclusion, as has been said before, but it is not possible if the 
<A NAME="941"></A>premisses are opposed. For the syllogism is always contrary to the fact, 
<A NAME="942"></A>e.g. if a thing is good, it is proved that it is not good, if an animal, 
<A NAME="943"></A>that it is not an animal because the syllogism springs out of a contradiction 
<A NAME="944"></A>and the terms presupposed are either identical or related as whole and 
<A NAME="945"></A>part. It is evident also that in fallacious reasonings nothing prevents 
<A NAME="946"></A>a contradiction to the hypothesis from resulting, e.g. if something is 
<A NAME="947"></A>odd, it is not odd. For the syllogism owed its contrariety to its contradictory 
<A NAME="948"></A>premisses; if we assume such premisses we shall get a result that contradicts 
<A NAME="949"></A>our hypothesis. But we must recognize that contraries cannot be inferred 
<A NAME="950"></A>from a single syllogism in such a way that we conclude that what is not 
<A NAME="951"></A>good is good, or anything of that sort unless a self-contradictory premiss 
<A NAME="952"></A>is at once assumed, e.g. 'every animal is white and not white', and we 
<A NAME="953"></A>proceed 'man is an animal'. Either we must introduce the contradiction 
<A NAME="954"></A>by an additional assumption, assuming, e.g., that every science is supposition, 
<A NAME="955"></A>and then assuming 'Medicine is a science, but none of it is supposition' 
<A NAME="956"></A>(which is the mode in which refutations are made), or we must argue from 
<A NAME="957"></A>two syllogisms. In no other way than this, as was said before, is it possible 
<A NAME="958"></A>that the premisses should be really contrary.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="959"></A><B>Part 16</B>

<A NAME="960"></A><BR><BR>To beg and assume the original question is a species of failure 
<A NAME="961"></A>to demonstrate the problem proposed; but this happens in many ways. A man 
<A NAME="962"></A>may not reason syllogistically at all, or he may argue from premisses which 
<A NAME="963"></A>are less known or equally unknown, or he may establish the antecedent by 
<A NAME="964"></A>means of its consequents; for demonstration proceeds from what is more 
<A NAME="965"></A>certain and is prior. Now begging the question is none of these: but since 
<A NAME="966"></A>we get to know some things naturally through themselves, and other things 
<A NAME="967"></A>by means of something else (the first principles through themselves, what 
<A NAME="968"></A>is subordinate to them through something else), whenever a man tries to 
<A NAME="969"></A>prove what is not self-evident by means of itself, then he begs the original 
<A NAME="970"></A>question. This may be done by assuming what is in question at once; it 
<A NAME="971"></A>is also possible to make a transition to other things which would naturally 
<A NAME="972"></A>be proved through the thesis proposed, and demonstrate it through them, 
<A NAME="973"></A>e.g. if A should be proved through B, and B through C, though it was natural 
<A NAME="974"></A>that C should be proved through A: for it turns out that those who reason 
<A NAME="975"></A>thus are proving A by means of itself. This is what those persons do who 
<A NAME="976"></A>suppose that they are constructing parallel straight lines: for they fail 
<A NAME="977"></A>to see that they are assuming facts which it is impossible to demonstrate 
<A NAME="978"></A>unless the parallels exist. So it turns out that those who reason thus 
<A NAME="979"></A>merely say a particular thing is, if it is: in this way everything will 
<A NAME="980"></A>be self-evident. But that is impossible.
<A NAME="981"></A><BR><BR>If then it is uncertain whether A belongs to C, and also whether 
<A NAME="982"></A>A belongs to B, and if one should assume that A does belong to B, it is 
<A NAME="983"></A>not yet clear whether he begs the original question, but it is evident 
<A NAME="984"></A>that he is not demonstrating: for what is as uncertain as the question 
<A NAME="985"></A>to be answered cannot be a principle of a demonstration. If however B is 
<A NAME="986"></A>so related to C that they are identical, or if they are plainly convertible, 
<A NAME="987"></A>or the one belongs to the other, the original question is begged. For one 
<A NAME="988"></A>might equally well prove that A belongs to B through those terms if they 
<A NAME="989"></A>are convertible. But if they are not convertible, it is the fact that they 
<A NAME="990"></A>are not that prevents such a demonstration, not the method of demonstrating. 
<A NAME="991"></A>But if one were to make the conversion, then he would be doing what we 
<A NAME="992"></A>have described and effecting a reciprocal proof with three 
<A NAME="993"></A>propositions.
<A NAME="994"></A><BR><BR>Similarly if he should assume that B belongs to C, this being as 
<A NAME="995"></A>uncertain as the question whether A belongs to C, the question is not yet 
<A NAME="996"></A>begged, but no demonstration is made. If however A and B are identical 
<A NAME="997"></A>either because they are convertible or because A follows B, then the question 
<A NAME="998"></A>is begged for the same reason as before. For we have explained the meaning 
<A NAME="999"></A>of begging the question, viz. proving that which is not self-evident by 
<A NAME="1000"></A>means of itself.
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR><BR>If then begging the question is proving what is not self-evident 
<A NAME="1002"></A>by means of itself, in other words failing to prove when the failure is 
<A NAME="1003"></A>due to the thesis to be proved and the premiss through which it is proved 
<A NAME="1004"></A>being equally uncertain, either because predicates which are identical 
<A NAME="1005"></A>belong to the same subject, or because the same predicate belongs to subjects 
<A NAME="1006"></A>which are identical, the question may be begged in the middle and third 
<A NAME="1007"></A>figures in both ways, though, if the syllogism is affirmative, only in 
<A NAME="1008"></A>the third and first figures. If the syllogism is negative, the question 
<A NAME="1009"></A>is begged when identical predicates are denied of the same subject; and 
<A NAME="1010"></A>both premisses do not beg the question indifferently (in a similar way 
<A NAME="1011"></A>the question may be begged in the middle figure), because the terms in 
<A NAME="1012"></A>negative syllogisms are not convertible. In scientific demonstrations the 
<A NAME="1013"></A>question is begged when the terms are really related in the manner described, 
<A NAME="1014"></A>in dialectical arguments when they are according to common opinion so 
<A NAME="1015"></A>related.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1016"></A><B>Part 17</B>

<A NAME="1017"></A><BR><BR>The objection that 'this is not the reason why the result is false', 
<A NAME="1018"></A>which we frequently make in argument, is made primarily in the case of 
<A NAME="1019"></A>a reductio ad impossibile, to rebut the proposition which was being proved 
<A NAME="1020"></A>by the reduction. For unless a man has contradicted this proposition he 
<A NAME="1021"></A>will not say, 'False cause', but urge that something false has been assumed 
<A NAME="1022"></A>in the earlier parts of the argument; nor will he use the formula in the 
<A NAME="1023"></A>case of an ostensive proof; for here what one denies is not assumed as 
<A NAME="1024"></A>a premiss. Further when anything is refuted ostensively by the terms ABC, 
<A NAME="1025"></A>it cannot be objected that the syllogism does not depend on the assumption 
<A NAME="1026"></A>laid down. For we use the expression 'false cause', when the syllogism 
<A NAME="1027"></A>is concluded in spite of the refutation of this position; but that is not 
<A NAME="1028"></A>possible in ostensive proofs: since if an assumption is refuted, a syllogism 
<A NAME="1029"></A>can no longer be drawn in reference to it. It is clear then that the expression 
<A NAME="1030"></A>'false cause' can only be used in the case of a reductio ad impossibile, 
<A NAME="1031"></A>and when the original hypothesis is so related to the impossible conclusion, 
<A NAME="1032"></A>that the conclusion results indifferently whether the hypothesis is made 
<A NAME="1033"></A>or not. The most obvious case of the irrelevance of an assumption to a 
<A NAME="1034"></A>conclusion which is false is when a syllogism drawn from middle terms to 
<A NAME="1035"></A>an impossible conclusion is independent of the hypothesis, as we have explained 
<A NAME="1036"></A>in the Topics. For to put that which is not the cause as the cause, is 
<A NAME="1037"></A>just this: e.g. if a man, wishing to prove that the diagonal of the square 
<A NAME="1038"></A>is incommensurate with the side, should try to prove Zeno's theorem that 
<A NAME="1039"></A>motion is impossible, and so establish a reductio ad impossibile: for Zeno's 
<A NAME="1040"></A>false theorem has no connexion at all with the original assumption. Another 
<A NAME="1041"></A>case is where the impossible conclusion is connected with the hypothesis, 
<A NAME="1042"></A>but does not result from it. This may happen whether one traces the connexion 
<A NAME="1043"></A>upwards or downwards, e.g. if it is laid down that A belongs to B, B to 
<A NAME="1044"></A>C, and C to D, and it should be false that B belongs to D: for if we eliminated 
<A NAME="1045"></A>A and assumed all the same that B belongs to C and C to D, the false conclusion 
<A NAME="1046"></A>would not depend on the original hypothesis. Or again trace the connexion 
<A NAME="1047"></A>upwards; e.g. suppose that A belongs to B, E to A and F to E, it being 
<A NAME="1048"></A>false that F belongs to A. In this way too the impossible conclusion would 
<A NAME="1049"></A>result, though the original hypothesis were eliminated. But the impossible 
<A NAME="1050"></A>conclusion ought to be connected with the original terms: in this way it 
<A NAME="1051"></A>will depend on the hypothesis, e.g. when one traces the connexion downwards, 
<A NAME="1052"></A>the impossible conclusion must be connected with that term which is predicate 
<A NAME="1053"></A>in the hypothesis: for if it is impossible that A should belong to D, the 
<A NAME="1054"></A>false conclusion will no longer result after A has been eliminated. If 
<A NAME="1055"></A>one traces the connexion upwards, the impossible conclusion must be connected 
<A NAME="1056"></A>with that term which is subject in the hypothesis: for if it is impossible 
<A NAME="1057"></A>that F should belong to B, the impossible conclusion will disappear if 
<A NAME="1058"></A>B is eliminated. Similarly when the syllogisms are negative.
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then that when the impossibility is not related to 
<A NAME="1060"></A>the original terms, the false conclusion does not result on account of 
<A NAME="1061"></A>the assumption. Or perhaps even so it may sometimes be independent. For 
<A NAME="1062"></A>if it were laid down that A belongs not to B but to K, and that K belongs 
<A NAME="1063"></A>to C and C to D, the impossible conclusion would still stand. Similarly 
<A NAME="1064"></A>if one takes the terms in an ascending series. Consequently since the impossibility 
<A NAME="1065"></A>results whether the first assumption is suppressed or not, it would appear 
<A NAME="1066"></A>to be independent of that assumption. Or perhaps we ought not to understand 
<A NAME="1067"></A>the statement that the false conclusion results independently of the assumption, 
<A NAME="1068"></A>in the sense that if something else were supposed the impossibility would 
<A NAME="1069"></A>result; but rather we mean that when the first assumption is eliminated, 
<A NAME="1070"></A>the same impossibility results through the remaining premisses; since it 
<A NAME="1071"></A>is not perhaps absurd that the same false result should follow from several 
<A NAME="1072"></A>hypotheses, e.g. that parallels meet, both on the assumption that the interior 
<A NAME="1073"></A>angle is greater than the exterior and on the assumption that a triangle 
<A NAME="1074"></A>contains more than two right angles.

<A NAME="1076"></A><BR><BR>A false argument depends on the first false statement in it. Every 
<A NAME="1077"></A>syllogism is made out of two or more premisses. If then the false conclusion 
<A NAME="1078"></A>is drawn from two premisses, one or both of them must be false: for (as 
<A NAME="1079"></A>we proved) a false syllogism cannot be drawn from two premisses. But if 
<A NAME="1080"></A>the premisses are more than two, e.g. if C is established through A and 
<A NAME="1081"></A>B, and these through D, E, F, and G, one of these higher propositions must 
<A NAME="1082"></A>be false, and on this the argument depends: for A and B are inferred by 
<A NAME="1083"></A>means of D, E, F, and G. Therefore the conclusion and the error results 
<A NAME="1084"></A>from one of them.

<A NAME="1086"></A><BR><BR>In order to avoid having a syllogism drawn against us we must take 
<A NAME="1087"></A>care, whenever an opponent asks us to admit the reason without the conclusions, 
<A NAME="1088"></A>not to grant him the same term twice over in his premisses, since we know 
<A NAME="1089"></A>that a syllogism cannot be drawn without a middle term, and that term which 
<A NAME="1090"></A>is stated more than once is the middle. How we ought to watch the middle 
<A NAME="1091"></A>in reference to each conclusion, is evident from our knowing what kind 
<A NAME="1092"></A>of thesis is proved in each figure. This will not escape us since we know 
<A NAME="1093"></A>how we are maintaining the argument.
