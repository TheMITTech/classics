<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>So much for the generative processes in snakes and insects, and also in 
<A NAME="12"></A>oviparous quadrupeds. Birds without exception lay eggs, but the pairing 
<A NAME="13"></A>season and the times of parturition are not alike for all. Some birds couple 
<A NAME="14"></A>and lay at almost any time in the year, as for instance the barn-door hen 
<A NAME="15"></A>and the pigeon: the former of these coupling and laying during the entire 
<A NAME="16"></A>year, with the exception of the month before and the month after the winter 
<A NAME="17"></A>solstice. Some hens, even in the high breeds, lay a large quantity of eggs 
<A NAME="18"></A>before brooding, amounting to as many as sixty; and, by the way, the higher 
<A NAME="19"></A>breeds are less prolific than the inferior ones. The Adrian hens are small-sized, 
<A NAME="20"></A>but they lay every day; they are cross-tempered, and often kill their chickens; 
<A NAME="21"></A>they are of all colours. Some domesticated hens lay twice a day; indeed, 
<A NAME="22"></A>instances have been known where hens, after exhibiting extreme fecundity, 
<A NAME="23"></A>have died suddenly. Hens, then, lay eggs, as has been stated, at all times 
<A NAME="24"></A>indiscriminately; the pigeon, the ring-dove, the turtle-dove, and the stock-dove 
<A NAME="25"></A>lay twice a year, and the pigeon actually lays ten times a year. The great 
<A NAME="26"></A>majority of birds lay during the spring-time. Some birds are prolific, 
<A NAME="27"></A>and prolific in either of two ways-either by laying often, as the pigeon, 
<A NAME="28"></A>or by laying many eggs at a sitting, as the barn-door hen. All birds of 
<A NAME="29"></A>prey, or birds with crooked talons, are unprolific, except the kestrel: 
<A NAME="30"></A>this bird is the most prolific of birds of prey; as many as four eggs have 
<A NAME="31"></A>been observed in the nest, and occasionally it lays even 
<A NAME="32"></A>more.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>Birds in general lay their eggs in nests, but such as are disqualified 
<A NAME="34"></A>for flight, as the partridge and the quail, do not lay them in nests but 
<A NAME="35"></A>on the ground, and cover them over with loose material. The same is the 
<A NAME="36"></A>case with the lark and the tetrix. These birds hatch in sheltered places; 
<A NAME="37"></A>but the bird called merops in Boeotia, alone of all birds, burrows into 
<A NAME="38"></A>holes in the ground and hatches there.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>Thrushes, like swallows, build nests of clay, on high trees, and 
<A NAME="40"></A>build them in rows all close together, so that from their continuity the 
<A NAME="41"></A>structure resembles a necklace of nests. Of all birds that hatch for themselves 
<A NAME="42"></A>the hoopoe is the only one that builds no nest whatever; it gets into the 
<A NAME="43"></A>hollow of the trunk of a tree, and lays its eggs there without making any 
<A NAME="44"></A>sort of nest. The circus builds either under a dwelling-roof or on cliffs. 
<A NAME="45"></A>The tetrix, called ourax in Athens, builds neither on the ground nor on 
<A NAME="46"></A>trees, but on low-lying shrubs.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="47"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>The egg in the case of all birds alike is hard-shelled, if it be 
<A NAME="49"></A>the produce of copulation and be laid by a healthy hen-for some hens lay 
<A NAME="50"></A>soft eggs. The interior of the egg is of two colours, and the white part 
<A NAME="51"></A>is outside and the yellow part within.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>The eggs of birds that frequent rivers and marshes differ from 
<A NAME="53"></A>those of birds that live on dry land; that is to say, the eggs of waterbirds 
<A NAME="54"></A>have comparatively more of the yellow or yolk and less of the white. Eggs 
<A NAME="55"></A>vary in colour according to their kind. Some eggs are white, as those of 
<A NAME="56"></A>the pigeon and of the partridge; others are yellowish, as the eggs of marsh 
<A NAME="57"></A>birds; in some cases the eggs are mottled, as the eggs of the guinea-fowl 
<A NAME="58"></A>and the pheasant; while the eggs of the kestrel are red, like 
<A NAME="59"></A>vermilion.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>Eggs are not symmetrically shaped at both ends: in other words, 
<A NAME="61"></A>one end is comparatively sharp, and the other end is comparatively blunt; 
<A NAME="62"></A>and it is the latter end that protrudes first at the time of laying. Long 
<A NAME="63"></A>and pointed eggs are female; those that are round, or more rounded at the 
<A NAME="64"></A>narrow end, are male. Eggs are hatched by the incubation of the mother-bird. 
<A NAME="65"></A>In some cases, as in Egypt, they are hatched spontaneously in the ground, 
<A NAME="66"></A>by being buried in dung heaps. A story is told of a toper in Syracuse, 
<A NAME="67"></A>how he used to put eggs into the ground under his rush-mat and to keep 
<A NAME="68"></A>on drinking until he hatched them. Instances have occurred of eggs being 
<A NAME="69"></A>deposited in warm vessels and getting hatched spontaneously.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>The sperm of birds, as of animals in general, is white. After the 
<A NAME="71"></A>female has submitted to the male, she draws up the sperm to underneath 
<A NAME="72"></A>her midriff. At first it is little in size and white in colour; by and 
<A NAME="73"></A>by it is red, the colour of blood; as it grows, it becomes pale and yellow 
<A NAME="74"></A>all over. When at length it is getting ripe for hatching, it is subject 
<A NAME="75"></A>to differentiation of substance, and the yolk gathers together within and 
<A NAME="76"></A>the white settles round it on the outside. When the full time is come, 
<A NAME="77"></A>the egg detaches itself and protrudes, changing from soft to hard with 
<A NAME="78"></A>such temporal exactitude that, whereas it is not hard during the process 
<A NAME="79"></A>of protrusion, it hardens immediately after the process is completed: that 
<A NAME="80"></A>is if there be no concomitant pathological circumstances. Cases have occurred 
<A NAME="81"></A>where substances resembling the egg at a critical point of its growth-that 
<A NAME="82"></A>is, when it is yellow all over, as the yolk is subsequently-have been found 
<A NAME="83"></A>in the cock when cut open, underneath his midriff, just where the hen has 
<A NAME="84"></A>her eggs; and these are entirely yellow in appearance and of the same size 
<A NAME="85"></A>as ordinary eggs. Such phenomena are regarded as unnatural and 
<A NAME="86"></A>portentous.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>Such as affirm that wind-eggs are the residua of eggs previously 
<A NAME="88"></A>begotten from copulation are mistaken in this assertion, for we have cases 
<A NAME="89"></A>well authenticated where chickens of the common hen and goose have laid 
<A NAME="90"></A>wind-eggs without ever having been subjected to copulation. Wind-eggs are 
<A NAME="91"></A>smaller, less palatable, and more liquid than true eggs, and are produced 
<A NAME="92"></A>in greater numbers. When they are put under the mother bird, the liquid 
<A NAME="93"></A>contents never coagulate, but both the yellow and the white remain as they 
<A NAME="94"></A>were. Wind-eggs are laid by a number of birds: as for instance by the common 
<A NAME="95"></A>hen, the hen partridge, the hen pigeon, the peahen, the goose, and the 
<A NAME="96"></A>vulpanser. Eggs are hatched under brooding hens more rapidly in summer 
<A NAME="97"></A>than in winter; that is to say, hens hatch in eighteen days in summer, 
<A NAME="98"></A>but occasionally in winter take as many as twenty-five. And by the way 
<A NAME="99"></A>for brooding purposes some birds make better mothers than others. If it 
<A NAME="100"></A>thunders while a hen-bird is brooding, the eggs get addled. Wind-eggs that 
<A NAME="101"></A>are called by some cynosura and uria are produced chiefly in summer. Wind-eggs 
<A NAME="102"></A>are called by some zephyr-eggs, because at spring-time hen-birds are observed 
<A NAME="103"></A>to inhale the breezes; they do the same if they be stroked in a peculiar 
<A NAME="104"></A>way by hand. Wind-eggs can turn into fertile eggs, and eggs due to previous 
<A NAME="105"></A>copulation can change breed, if before the change of the yellow to the 
<A NAME="106"></A>white the hen that contains wind-eggs, or eggs begotten of copulation be 
<A NAME="107"></A>trodden by another cock-bird. Under these circumstances the wind-eggs turn 
<A NAME="108"></A>into fertile eggs, and the previously impregnated eggs follow the breed 
<A NAME="109"></A>of the impregnator; but if the latter impregnation takes place during the 
<A NAME="110"></A>change of the yellow to the white, then no change in the egg takes place: 
<A NAME="111"></A>the wind-egg does not become a true egg, and the true egg does not take 
<A NAME="112"></A>on the breed of the latter impregnator. If when the egg-substance is small 
<A NAME="113"></A>copulation be intermitted, the previously existing egg-substance exhibits 
<A NAME="114"></A>no increase; but if the hen be again submitted to the male the increase 
<A NAME="115"></A>in size proceeds with rapidity.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>The yolk and the white are diverse not only in colour but also 
<A NAME="117"></A>in properties. Thus, the yolk congeals under the influence of cold, whereas 
<A NAME="118"></A>the white instead of congealing is inclined rather to liquefy. Again, the 
<A NAME="119"></A>white stiffens under the influence of fire, whereas the yolk does not stiffen; 
<A NAME="120"></A>but, unless it be burnt through and through, it remains soft, and in point 
<A NAME="121"></A>of fact is inclined to set or to harden more from the boiling than from 
<A NAME="122"></A>the roasting of the egg. The yolk and the white are separated by a membrane 
<A NAME="123"></A>from one another. The so-called 'hail-stones', or treadles, that are found 
<A NAME="124"></A>at the extremity of the yellow in no way contribute towards generation, 
<A NAME="125"></A>as some erroneously suppose: they are two in number, one below and the 
<A NAME="126"></A>other above. If you take out of the shells a number of yolks and a number 
<A NAME="127"></A>of whites and pour them into a sauce pan and boil them slowly over a low 
<A NAME="128"></A>fire, the yolks will gather into the centre and the whites will set all 
<A NAME="129"></A>around them.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>Young hens are the first to lay, and they do so at the beginning 
<A NAME="131"></A>of spring and lay more eggs than the older hens, but the eggs of the younger 
<A NAME="132"></A>hens are comparatively small. As a general rule, if hens get no brooding 
<A NAME="133"></A>they pine and sicken. After copulation hens shiver and shake themselves, 
<A NAME="134"></A>and often kick rubbish about all round them-and this, by the way, they 
<A NAME="135"></A>do sometimes after laying-whereas pigeons trail their rumps on the ground, 
<A NAME="136"></A>and geese dive under the water. Conception of the true egg and conformation 
<A NAME="137"></A>of the wind-egg take place rapidly with most birds; as for instance with 
<A NAME="138"></A>the hen-partridge when in heat. The fact is that, when she stands to windward 
<A NAME="139"></A>and within scent of the male, she conceives, and becomes useless for decoy 
<A NAME="140"></A>purposes: for, by the way, the partridge appears to have a very acute sense 
<A NAME="141"></A>of smell.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>The generation of the egg after copulation and the generation of 
<A NAME="143"></A>the chick from the subsequent hatching of the egg are not brought about 
<A NAME="144"></A>within equal periods for all birds, but differ as to time according to 
<A NAME="145"></A>the size of the parent-birds. The egg of the common hen after copulation 
<A NAME="146"></A>sets and matures in ten days a general rule; the egg of the pigeon in a 
<A NAME="147"></A>somewhat lesser period. Pigeons have the faculty of holding back the egg 
<A NAME="148"></A>at the very moment of parturition; if a hen pigeon be put about by any 
<A NAME="149"></A>one, for instance if it be disturbed on its nest, or have a feather plucked 
<A NAME="150"></A>out, or sustain any other annoyance or disturbance, then even though she 
<A NAME="151"></A>had made up her mind to lay she can keep the egg back in abeyance. A singular 
<A NAME="152"></A>phenomenon is observed in pigeons with regard to pairing: that is, they 
<A NAME="153"></A>kiss one another just when the male is on the point of mounting the female, 
<A NAME="154"></A>and without this preliminary the male would decline to perform his function. 
<A NAME="155"></A>With the older males the preliminary kiss is only given to begin with, 
<A NAME="156"></A>and subsequently sequently he mounts without previously kissing; with younger 
<A NAME="157"></A>males the preliminary is never omitted. Another singularity in these birds 
<A NAME="158"></A>is that the hens tread one another when a cock is not forthcoming, after 
<A NAME="159"></A>kissing one another just as takes place in the normal pairing. Though they 
<A NAME="160"></A>do not impregnate one another they lay more eggs under these than under 
<A NAME="161"></A>ordinary circumstances; no chicks, however, result therefrom, but all such 
<A NAME="162"></A>eggs are wind-eggs.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="163"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>Generation from the egg proceeds in an identical manner with all 
<A NAME="165"></A>birds, but the full periods from conception to birth differ, as has been 
<A NAME="166"></A>said. With the common hen after three days and three nights there is the 
<A NAME="167"></A>first indication of the embryo; with larger birds the interval being longer, 
<A NAME="168"></A>with smaller birds shorter. Meanwhile the yolk comes into being, rising 
<A NAME="169"></A>towards the sharp end, where the primal element of the egg is situated, 
<A NAME="170"></A>and where the egg gets hatched; and the heart appears, like a speck of 
<A NAME="171"></A>blood, in the white of the egg. This point beats and moves as though endowed 
<A NAME="172"></A>with life, and from it two vein-ducts with blood in them trend in a convoluted 
<A NAME="173"></A>course (as the egg substance goes on growing, towards each of the two circumjacent 
<A NAME="174"></A>integuments); and a membrane carrying bloody fibres now envelops the yolk, 
<A NAME="175"></A>leading off from the vein-ducts. A little afterwards the body is differentiated, 
<A NAME="176"></A>at first very small and white. The head is clearly distinguished, and in 
<A NAME="177"></A>it the eyes, swollen out to a great extent. This condition of the eyes 
<A NAME="178"></A>lat on for a good while, as it is only by degrees that they diminish in 
<A NAME="179"></A>size and collapse. At the outset the under portion of the body appears 
<A NAME="180"></A>insignificant in comparison with the upper portion. Of the two ducts that 
<A NAME="181"></A>lead from the heart, the one proceeds towards the circumjacent integument, 
<A NAME="182"></A>and the other, like a navel-string, towards the yolk. The life-element 
<A NAME="183"></A>of the chick is in the white of the egg, and the nutriment comes through 
<A NAME="184"></A>the navel-string out of the yolk.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>When the egg is now ten days old the chick and all its parts are 
<A NAME="186"></A>distinctly visible. The head is still larger than the rest of its body, 
<A NAME="187"></A>and the eyes larger than the head, but still devoid of vision. The eyes, 
<A NAME="188"></A>if removed about this time, are found to be larger than beans, and black; 
<A NAME="189"></A>if the cuticle be peeled off them there is a white and cold liquid inside, 
<A NAME="190"></A>quite glittering in the sunlight, but there is no hard substance whatsoever. 
<A NAME="191"></A>Such is the condition of the head and eyes. At this time also the larger 
<A NAME="192"></A>internal organs are visible, as also the stomach and the arrangement of 
<A NAME="193"></A>the viscera; and veins that seem to proceed from the heart are now close 
<A NAME="194"></A>to the navel. From the navel there stretch a pair of veins; one towards 
<A NAME="195"></A>the membrane that envelops the yolk (and, by the way, the yolk is now liquid, 
<A NAME="196"></A>or more so than is normal), and the other towards that membrane which envelops 
<A NAME="197"></A>collectively the membrane wherein the chick lies, the membrane of the yolk, 
<A NAME="198"></A>and the intervening liquid. (For, as the chick grows, little by little 
<A NAME="199"></A>one part of the yolk goes upward, and another part downward, and the white 
<A NAME="200"></A>liquid is between them; and the white of the egg is underneath the lower 
<A NAME="201"></A>part of the yolk, as it was at the outset.) On the tenth day the white 
<A NAME="202"></A>is at the extreme outer surface, reduced in amount, glutinous, firm in 
<A NAME="203"></A>substance, and sallow in colour.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>The disposition of the several constituent parts is as follows. 
<A NAME="205"></A>First and outermost comes the membrane of the egg, not that of the shell, 
<A NAME="206"></A>but underneath it. Inside this membrane is a white liquid; then comes the 
<A NAME="207"></A>chick, and a membrane round about it, separating it off so as to keep the 
<A NAME="208"></A>chick free from the liquid; next after the chick comes the yolk, into which 
<A NAME="209"></A>one of the two veins was described as leading, the other one leading into 
<A NAME="210"></A>the enveloping white substance. (A membrane with a liquid resembling serum 
<A NAME="211"></A>envelops the entire structure. Then comes another membrane right round 
<A NAME="212"></A>the embryo, as has been described, separating it off against the liquid. 
<A NAME="213"></A>Underneath this comes the yolk, enveloped in another membrane (into which 
<A NAME="214"></A>yolk proceeds the navel-string that leads from the heart and the big vein), 
<A NAME="215"></A>so as to keep the embryo free of both liquids.)
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>About the twentieth day, if you open the egg and touch the chick, 
<A NAME="217"></A>it moves inside and chirps; and it is already coming to be covered with 
<A NAME="218"></A>down, when, after the twentieth day is ast, the chick begins to break the 
<A NAME="219"></A>shell. The head is situated over the right leg close to the flank, and 
<A NAME="220"></A>the wing is placed over the head; and about this time is plain to be seen 
<A NAME="221"></A>the membrane resembling an after-birth that comes next after the outermost 
<A NAME="222"></A>membrane of the shell, into which membrane the one of the navel-strings 
<A NAME="223"></A>was described as leading (and, by the way, the chick in its entirety is 
<A NAME="224"></A>now within it), and so also is the other membrane resembling an after-birth, 
<A NAME="225"></A>namely that surrounding the yolk, into which the second navel-string was 
<A NAME="226"></A>described as leading; and both of them were described as being connected 
<A NAME="227"></A>with the heart and the big vein. At this conjuncture the navel-string that 
<A NAME="228"></A>leads to the outer afterbirth collapses and becomes detached from the chick, 
<A NAME="229"></A>and the membrane that leads into the yolk is fastened on to the thin gut 
<A NAME="230"></A>of the creature, and by this time a considerable amount of the yolk is 
<A NAME="231"></A>inside the chick and a yellow sediment is in its stomach. About this time 
<A NAME="232"></A>it discharges residuum in the direction of the outer after-birth, and has 
<A NAME="233"></A>residuum inside its stomach; and the outer residuum is white (and there 
<A NAME="234"></A>comes a white substance inside). By and by the yolk, diminishing gradually 
<A NAME="235"></A>in size, at length becomes entirely used up and comprehended within the 
<A NAME="236"></A>chick (so that, ten days after hatching, if you cut open the chick, a small 
<A NAME="237"></A>remnant of the yolk is still left in connexion with the gut), but it is 
<A NAME="238"></A>detached from the navel, and there is nothing in the interval between, 
<A NAME="239"></A>but it has been used up entirely. During the period above referred to the 
<A NAME="240"></A>chick sleeps, wakes up, makes a move and looks up and Chirps; and the heart 
<A NAME="241"></A>and the navel together palpitate as though the creature were respiring. 
<A NAME="242"></A>So much as to generation from the egg in the case of 
<A NAME="243"></A>birds.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>Birds lay some eggs that are unfruitful, even eggs that are the 
<A NAME="245"></A>result of copulation, and no life comes from such eggs by incubation; and 
<A NAME="246"></A>this phenomenon is observed especially with pigeons.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>Twin eggs have two yolks. In some twin eggs a thin partition of 
<A NAME="248"></A>white intervenes to prevent the yolks mixing with each other, but some 
<A NAME="249"></A>twin eggs are unprovided with such partition, and the yokes run into one 
<A NAME="250"></A>another. There are some hens that lay nothing but twin eggs, and in their 
<A NAME="251"></A>case the phenomenon regarding the yolks has been observed. For instance, 
<A NAME="252"></A>a hen has been known to lay eighteen eggs, and to hatch twins out of them 
<A NAME="253"></A>all, except those that were wind-eggs; the rest were fertile (though, by 
<A NAME="254"></A>the way, one of the twins is always bigger than the other), but the eighteenth 
<A NAME="255"></A>was abnormal or monstrous.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="256"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>Birds of the pigeon kind, such as the ringdove and the turtle-dove, 
<A NAME="258"></A>lay two eggs at a time; that is to say, they do so as a general rule, and 
<A NAME="259"></A>they never lay more than three. The pigeon, as has been said, lays at all 
<A NAME="260"></A>seasons; the ring-dove and the turtle-dove lay in the springtime, and they 
<A NAME="261"></A>never lay more than twice in the same season. The hen-bird lays the second 
<A NAME="262"></A>pair of eggs when the first pair happens to have been destroyed, for many 
<A NAME="263"></A>of the hen-pigeons destroy the first brood. The hen-pigeon, as has been 
<A NAME="264"></A>said, occasionally lays three eggs, but it never rears more than two chicks, 
<A NAME="265"></A>and sometimes rears only one; and the odd one is always a 
<A NAME="266"></A>wind-egg.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>Very few birds propagate within their first year. All birds, after 
<A NAME="268"></A>once they have begun laying, keep on having eggs, though in the case of 
<A NAME="269"></A>some birds it is difficult to detect the fact from the minute size of the 
<A NAME="270"></A>creature.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>The pigeon, as a rule, lays a male and a female egg, and generally 
<A NAME="272"></A>lays the male egg first; after laying it allows a day's interval to ensue 
<A NAME="273"></A>and then lays the second egg. The male takes its turn of sitting during 
<A NAME="274"></A>the daytime; the female sits during the night. The first-laid egg is hatched 
<A NAME="275"></A>and brought to birth within twenty days; and the mother bird pecks a hole 
<A NAME="276"></A>in the egg the day before she hatches it out. The two parent birds brood 
<A NAME="277"></A>for some time over the chicks in the way in which they brooded previously 
<A NAME="278"></A>over the eggs. In all connected with the rearing of the young the female 
<A NAME="279"></A>parent is more cross-tempered than the male, as is the case with most animals 
<A NAME="280"></A>after parturition. The hens lay as many as ten times in the year; occasional 
<A NAME="281"></A>instances have been known of their laying eleven times, and in Egypt they 
<A NAME="282"></A>actually lay twelve times. The pigeon, male and female, couples within 
<A NAME="283"></A>the year; in fact, it couples when only six months old. Some assert that 
<A NAME="284"></A>ringdoves and turtle-doves pair and procreate when only three months old, 
<A NAME="285"></A>and instance their superabundant numbers by way of proof of the assertion. 
<A NAME="286"></A>The hen-pigeon carries her eggs fourteen days; for as many more days the 
<A NAME="287"></A>parent birds hatch the eggs; by the end of another fourteen days the chicks 
<A NAME="288"></A>are so far capable of flight as to be overtaken with difficulty. (The ring-dove, 
<A NAME="289"></A>according to all accounts, lives up to forty years. The partridge lives 
<A NAME="290"></A>over sixteen.) (After one brood the pigeon is ready for another within 
<A NAME="291"></A>thirty days.)

<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>The vulture builds its nest on inaccessible cliffs; for which reason 
<A NAME="294"></A>its nest and young are rarely seen. And therefore Herodorus, father of 
<A NAME="295"></A>Bryson the Sophist, declares that vultures belong to some foreign country 
<A NAME="296"></A>unknown to us, stating as a proof of the assertion that no one has ever 
<A NAME="297"></A>seen a vulture's nest, and also that vultures in great numbers make a sudden 
<A NAME="298"></A>appearance in the rear of armies. However, difficult as it is to get a 
<A NAME="299"></A>sight of it, a vulture's nest has been seen. The vulture lays two 
<A NAME="300"></A>eggs.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>(Carnivorous birds in general are observed to lay but once a year. 
<A NAME="302"></A>The swallow is the only carnivorous bird that builds a nest twice. If you 
<A NAME="303"></A>prick out the eyes of swallow chicks while they are yet young, the birds 
<A NAME="304"></A>will get well again and will see by and by.)
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="305"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>The eagle lays three eggs and hatches two of them, as it is said 
<A NAME="307"></A>in the verses ascribed to Musaeus:
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR><B>That lays three, hatches two, and cares for 
<A NAME="309"></A>one.</B>
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>This is the case in most instances, though occasionally a brood 
<A NAME="311"></A>of three has been observed. As the young ones grow, the mother becomes 
<A NAME="312"></A>wearied with feeding them and extrudes one of the pair from the nest. At 
<A NAME="313"></A>the same time the bird is said to abstain from food, to avoid harrying 
<A NAME="314"></A>the young of wild animals. That is to say, its  wings blanch, and for some 
<A NAME="315"></A>days its talons get turned awry. It is in consequence about this time cross-tempered 
<A NAME="316"></A>to its own young. The phene is said to rear the young one that has been 
<A NAME="317"></A>expelled the nest. The eagle broods for about thirty 
<A NAME="318"></A>days.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>The hatching period is about the same for the larger birds, such 
<A NAME="320"></A>as the goose and the great bustard; for the middle-sized birds it extends 
<A NAME="321"></A>over about twenty days, as in the case of the kite and the hawk. The kite 
<A NAME="322"></A>in general lays two eggs, but occasionally rears three young ones. The 
<A NAME="323"></A>so-called aegolius at times rears four. It is not true that, as some aver, 
<A NAME="324"></A>the raven lays only two eggs; it lays a larger number. It broods for about 
<A NAME="325"></A>twenty days and then extrudes its young. Other birds perform the same operation; 
<A NAME="326"></A>at all events mother birds that lay several eggs often extrude one of their 
<A NAME="327"></A>young.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>Birds of the eagle species are not alike in the treatment of their 
<A NAME="329"></A>young. The white-tailed eagle is cross, the black eagle is affectionate 
<A NAME="330"></A>in the feeding of the young; though, by the way, all birds of prey, when 
<A NAME="331"></A>their brood is rather forward in being able to fly, beat and extrude them 
<A NAME="332"></A>from the nest. The majority of birds other than birds of prey, as has been 
<A NAME="333"></A>said, also act in this manner, and after feeding their young take no further 
<A NAME="334"></A>care of them; but the crow is an exception. This bird for a considerable 
<A NAME="335"></A>time takes charge of her young; for, even when her young can fly, she flies 
<A NAME="336"></A>alongside of them and supplies them with food.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="337"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>The cuckoo is said by some to be a hawk transformed, because at 
<A NAME="339"></A>the time of the cuckoo's coming, the hawk, which it resembles, is never 
<A NAME="340"></A>seen; and indeed it is only for a few days that you will see hawks about 
<A NAME="341"></A>when the cuckoo's note sounds early in the season. The cuckoo appears only 
<A NAME="342"></A>for a short time in summer, and in winter disappears. The hawk has crooked 
<A NAME="343"></A>talons, which the cuckoo has not; neither with regard to the head does 
<A NAME="344"></A>the cuckoo resemble the hawk. In point of fact, both as regards the head 
<A NAME="345"></A>and the claws it more resembles the pigeon. However, in colour and in colour 
<A NAME="346"></A>alone it does resemble the hawk, only that the markings of the hawk are 
<A NAME="347"></A>striped, and of the cuckoo mottled. And, by the way, in size and flight 
<A NAME="348"></A>it resembles the smallest of the hawk tribe, which bird disappears as a 
<A NAME="349"></A>rule about the time of the appearance of the cuckoo, though the two have 
<A NAME="350"></A>been seen simultaneously. The cuckoo has been seen to be preyed on by the 
<A NAME="351"></A>hawk; and this never happens between birds of the same species. They say 
<A NAME="352"></A>no one has ever seen the young of the cuckoo. The bird eggs, but does not 
<A NAME="353"></A>build a nest. Sometimes it lays its eggs in the nest of a smaller bird 
<A NAME="354"></A>after first devouring the eggs of this bird; it lays by preference in the 
<A NAME="355"></A>nest of the ringdove, after first devouring the eggs of the pigeon. (It 
<A NAME="356"></A>occasionally lays two, but usually one.) It lays also in the nest of the 
<A NAME="357"></A>hypolais, and the hypolais hatches and rears the brood. It is about this 
<A NAME="358"></A>time that the bird becomes fat and palatable. (The young of hawks also 
<A NAME="359"></A>get palatable and fat. One species builds a nest in the wilderness and 
<A NAME="360"></A>on sheer and inaccessible cliffs.)
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="361"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>With most birds, as has been said of the pigeon, the hatching is 
<A NAME="363"></A>carried on by the male and the female in turns: with some birds, however, 
<A NAME="364"></A>the male only sits long enough to allow the female to provide herself with 
<A NAME="365"></A>food. In the goose tribe the female alone incubates, and after once sitting 
<A NAME="366"></A>on the eggs she continues brooding until they are hatched.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR>The nests of all marsh-birds are built in districts fenny and well 
<A NAME="368"></A>supplied with grass; consequently, the mother-bird while sitting quiet 
<A NAME="369"></A>on her eggs can provide herself with food without having to submit to absolute 
<A NAME="370"></A>fasting.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>With the crow also the female alone broods, and broods throughout 
<A NAME="372"></A>the whole period; the male bird supports the female, bringing her food 
<A NAME="373"></A>and feeding her. The female of the ring-dove begins to brood in the afternoon 
<A NAME="374"></A>and broods through the entire night until breakfast-time of the following 
<A NAME="375"></A>day; the male broods during the rest of the time. Partridges build a nest 
<A NAME="376"></A>in two compartments; the male broods on the one and the female on the other. 
<A NAME="377"></A>After hatching, each of the parent birds rears its brood. But the male, 
<A NAME="378"></A>when he first takes his young out of the nest, treads 
<A NAME="379"></A>them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="380"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>Peafowl live for about twenty-five years, breed about the third 
<A NAME="382"></A>year, and at the same time take on their spangled plumage. They hatch their 
<A NAME="383"></A>eggs within thirty days or rather more. The peahen lays but once a year, 
<A NAME="384"></A>and lays twelve eggs, or may be a slightly lesser number: she does not 
<A NAME="385"></A>lay all the eggs there and then one after the other, but at intervals of 
<A NAME="386"></A>two or three days. Such as lay for the first time lay about eight eggs. 
<A NAME="387"></A>The peahen lays wind-eggs. They pair in the spring; and laying begins immediately 
<A NAME="388"></A>after pairing. The bird moults when the earliest trees are shedding their 
<A NAME="389"></A>leaves, and recovers its plumage when the same trees are recovering their 
<A NAME="390"></A>foliage. People that rear peafowl put the eggs under the barn-door hen, 
<A NAME="391"></A>owing to the fact that when the peahen is brooding over them the peacock 
<A NAME="392"></A>attacks her and tries to trample on them; owing to this circumstance some 
<A NAME="393"></A>birds of wild varieties run away from the males and lay their eggs and 
<A NAME="394"></A>brood in solitude. Only two eggs are put under a barn-door hen, for she 
<A NAME="395"></A>could not brood over and hatch a large number. They take every precaution, 
<A NAME="396"></A>by supplying her with food, to prevent her going off the eggs and discontinuing 
<A NAME="397"></A>the brooding.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>With male birds about pairing time the testicles are obviously 
<A NAME="399"></A>larger than at other times, and this is conspicuously the case with the 
<A NAME="400"></A>more salacious birds, such as the barn-door cock and the cock partridge; 
<A NAME="401"></A>the peculiarity is less conspicuous in such birds as are intermittent in 
<A NAME="402"></A>regard to pairing.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="403"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>So much for the conception and generation of 
<A NAME="405"></A>birds.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR>It has been previously stated that fishes are not all oviparous. Fishes 
<A NAME="407"></A>of the cartilaginous genus are viviparous; the rest are oviparous. And 
<A NAME="408"></A>cartilaginous fishes are first oviparous internally and subsequently viviparous; 
<A NAME="409"></A>they rear the embryos internally, the batrachus or fishing-frog being an 
<A NAME="410"></A>exception.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>Fishes also, as was above stated, are provided with wombs, and 
<A NAME="412"></A>wombs of diverse kinds. The oviparous genera have wombs bifurcate in shape 
<A NAME="413"></A>and low down in position; the cartilaginous genus have wombs shaped like 
<A NAME="414"></A>those of O birds. The womb, however, in the cartilaginous fishes differs 
<A NAME="415"></A>in this respect from the womb of birds, that with some cartilaginous fishes 
<A NAME="416"></A>the eggs do not settle close to the diaphragm but middle-ways along the 
<A NAME="417"></A>backbone, and as they grow they shift their position.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>The egg with all fishes is not of two colours within but is of 
<A NAME="419"></A>even hue; and the colour is nearer to white than to yellow, and that both 
<A NAME="420"></A>when the young is inside it and previously as well.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>Development from the egg in fishes differs from that in birds in 
<A NAME="422"></A>this respect, that it does not exhibit that one of the two navel-strings 
<A NAME="423"></A>that leads off to the membrane that lies close under the shell, while it 
<A NAME="424"></A>does exhibit that one of the two that in the case of birds leads off to 
<A NAME="425"></A>the yolk. In a general way the rest of the development from the egg onwards 
<A NAME="426"></A>is identical in birds and fishes. That is to say, development takes place 
<A NAME="427"></A>at the upper part of the egg, and the veins extend in like manner, at first 
<A NAME="428"></A>from the heart; and at first the head, the eyes, and the upper parts are 
<A NAME="429"></A>largest; and as the creature grows the egg-substance decreases and eventually 
<A NAME="430"></A>disappears, and becomes absorbed within the embryo, just as takes place 
<A NAME="431"></A>with the yolk in birds.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>The navel-string is attached a little way below the aperture of 
<A NAME="433"></A>the belly. When the creatures are young the navel-string is long, but as 
<A NAME="434"></A>they grow it diminishes in size; at length it gets small and becomes incorporated, 
<A NAME="435"></A>as was described in the case of birds. The embryo and the egg are enveloped 
<A NAME="436"></A>by a common membrane, and just under this is another membrane that envelops 
<A NAME="437"></A>the embryo by itself; and in between the two membranes is a liquid. The 
<A NAME="438"></A>food inside the stomach of the little fishes resembles that inside the 
<A NAME="439"></A>stomach of young chicks, and is partly white and partly 
<A NAME="440"></A>yellow.
<A NAME="441"></A><BR><BR>As regards the shape of the womb, the reader is referred to my 
<A NAME="442"></A>treatise on Anatomy. The womb, however, is diverse in diverse fishes, as 
<A NAME="443"></A>for instance in the sharks as compared one with another or as compared 
<A NAME="444"></A>with the skate. That is to say, in some sharks the eggs adhere in the middle 
<A NAME="445"></A>of the womb round about the backbone, as has been stated, and this is the 
<A NAME="446"></A>case with the dog-fish; as the eggs grow they shift their place; and since 
<A NAME="447"></A>the womb is bifurcate and adheres to the midriff, as in the rest of similar 
<A NAME="448"></A>creatures, the eggs pass into one or other of the two compartments. This 
<A NAME="449"></A>womb and the womb of the other sharks exhibit, as you go a little way off 
<A NAME="450"></A>from the midriff, something resembling white breasts, which never make 
<A NAME="451"></A>their appearance unless there be conception.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>Dog-fish and skate have a kind of egg-shell, in the which is found 
<A NAME="453"></A>an egg-like liquid. The shape of the egg-shell resembles the tongue of 
<A NAME="454"></A>a bagpipe, and hair-like ducts are attached to the shell. With the dog-fish 
<A NAME="455"></A>which is called by some the 'dappled shark', the young are born when the 
<A NAME="456"></A>shell-formation breaks in pieces and falls out; with the ray, after it 
<A NAME="457"></A>has laid the egg the shell-formation breaks up and the young move out. 
<A NAME="458"></A>The spiny dog-fish has its close to the midriff above the breast like formations; 
<A NAME="459"></A>when the egg descends, as soon as it gets detached the young is born. The 
<A NAME="460"></A>mode of generation is the same in the case of the fox-shark.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>The so-called smooth shark has its eggs in betwixt the wombs like 
<A NAME="462"></A>the dog-fish; these eggs shift into each of the two horns of the womb and 
<A NAME="463"></A>descend, and the young develop with the navel-string attached to the womb, 
<A NAME="464"></A>so that, as the egg-substance gets used up, the embryo is sustained to 
<A NAME="465"></A>all appearance just as in the case of quadrupeds. The navel-string is long 
<A NAME="466"></A>and adheres to the under part of the womb (each navel-string being attached 
<A NAME="467"></A>as it were by a sucker), and also to the centre of the embryo in the place 
<A NAME="468"></A>where the liver is situated. If the embryo be cut open, even though it 
<A NAME="469"></A>has the egg-substance no longer, the food inside is egg-like in appearance. 
<A NAME="470"></A>Each embryo, as in the case of quadrupeds, is provided with a chorion and 
<A NAME="471"></A>separate membranes. When young the embryo has its head upwards, but downwards 
<A NAME="472"></A>when it gets strong and is completed in form. Males are generated on the 
<A NAME="473"></A>left-hand side of the womb, and females on the right-hand side, and males 
<A NAME="474"></A>and females on the same side together. If the embryo be cut open, then, 
<A NAME="475"></A>as with quadrupeds, such internal organs as it is furnished with, as for 
<A NAME="476"></A>instance the liver, are found to be large and supplied with 
<A NAME="477"></A>blood.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>All cartilaginous fishes have at one and the same time eggs above 
<A NAME="479"></A>close to the midriff (some larger, some smaller), in considerable numbers, 
<A NAME="480"></A>and also embryos lower down. And this circumstance leads many to suppose 
<A NAME="481"></A>that fishes of this species pair and bear young every month, inasmuch as 
<A NAME="482"></A>they do not produce all their young at once, but now and again and over 
<A NAME="483"></A>a lengthened period. But such eggs as have come down below within the womb 
<A NAME="484"></A>are simultaneously ripened and completed in growth.
<A NAME="485"></A><BR><BR>Dog-fish in general can extrude and take in again their young, 
<A NAME="486"></A>as can also the angel-fish and the electric ray-and, by the way, a large 
<A NAME="487"></A>electric ray has been seen with about eighty embryos inside it-but the 
<A NAME="488"></A>spiny dogfish is an exception to the rule, being prevented by the spine 
<A NAME="489"></A>of the young fish from so doing. Of the flat cartilaginous fish, the trygon 
<A NAME="490"></A>and the ray cannot extrude and take in again in consequence of the roughness 
<A NAME="491"></A>of the tails of the young. The batrachus or fishing-frog also is unable 
<A NAME="492"></A>to take in its young owing to the size of the head and the prickles; and, 
<A NAME="493"></A>by the way, as was previously remarked, it is the only one of these fishes 
<A NAME="494"></A>that is not viviparous.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>So much for the varieties of the cartilaginous species and for 
<A NAME="496"></A>their modes of generation from the egg.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="497"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="498"></A><BR><BR>At the breeding season the sperm-ducts of the male are filled with 
<A NAME="499"></A>sperm, so much so that if they be squeezed the sperm flows out spontaneously 
<A NAME="500"></A>as a white fluid; the ducts are bifurcate, and start from the midriff and 
<A NAME="501"></A>the great vein. About this period the sperm-ducts of the male are quite 
<A NAME="502"></A>distinct (from the womb of the female) but at any other than the actual 
<A NAME="503"></A>breeding time their distinctness is not obvious to a non-expert. The fact 
<A NAME="504"></A>is that in certain fishes at certain times these organs are imperceptible, 
<A NAME="505"></A>as was stated regarding the testicles of birds.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>Among other distinctions observed between the thoric ducts and 
<A NAME="507"></A>the womb-ducts is the circumstance that the thoric ducts are attached to 
<A NAME="508"></A>the loins, while the womb-ducts move about freely and are attached by a 
<A NAME="509"></A>thin membrane. The particulars regarding the thoric ducts may be studied 
<A NAME="510"></A>by a reference to the diagrams in my treatise on Anatomy.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>Cartilaginous fishes are capable of superfoetation, and their period 
<A NAME="512"></A>of gestation is six months at the longest. The so-called starry dogfish 
<A NAME="513"></A>bears young the most frequently; in other words it bears twice a month. 
<A NAME="514"></A>The breeding season is in the month of Maemacterion. The dog-fish as a 
<A NAME="515"></A>general rule bear twice in the year, with the exception of the little dog-fish, 
<A NAME="516"></A>which bears only once a year. Some of them bring forth in the springtime. 
<A NAME="517"></A>The rhine, or angel-fish, bears its first brood in the springtime, and 
<A NAME="518"></A>its second in the autumn, about the winter setting of the Pleiads; the 
<A NAME="519"></A>second brood is the stronger of the two. The electric ray brings forth 
<A NAME="520"></A>in the late autumn.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>Cartilaginous fishes come out from the main seas and deep waters 
<A NAME="522"></A>towards the shore and there bring forth their young, and they do so for 
<A NAME="523"></A>the sake of warmth and by way of protection for their 
<A NAME="524"></A>young.
<A NAME="525"></A><BR><BR>Observations would lead to the general rule that no one variety 
<A NAME="526"></A>of fish pairs with another variety. The angel-fish, however, and the batus 
<A NAME="527"></A>or skate appear to pair with one another; for there is a fish called the 
<A NAME="528"></A>rhinobatus, with the head and front parts of the skate and the after parts 
<A NAME="529"></A>of the rhine or angel-fish, just as though it were made up of both fishes 
<A NAME="530"></A>together.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>Sharks then and their congeners, as the fox-shark and the dog-fish, 
<A NAME="532"></A>and the flat fishes, such as the electric ray, the ray, the smooth skate, 
<A NAME="533"></A>and the trygon, are first oviparous and then viviparous in the way above 
<A NAME="534"></A>mentioned, (as are also the saw-fish and the ox-ray.)
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="535"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>The dolphin, the whale, and all the rest of the Cetacea, all, that 
<A NAME="537"></A>is to say, that are provided with a blow-hole instead of gills, are viviparous. 
<A NAME="538"></A>That is to say, no one of all these fishes is ever seen to be supplied 
<A NAME="539"></A>with eggs, but directly with an embryo from whose differentiation comes 
<A NAME="540"></A>the fish, just as in the case of mankind and the viviparous 
<A NAME="541"></A>quadrupeds.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>The dolphin bears one at a time generally, but occasionally two. 
<A NAME="543"></A>The whale bears one or at the most two, generally two. The porpoise in 
<A NAME="544"></A>this respect resembles the dolphin, and, by the way, it is in form like 
<A NAME="545"></A>a little dolphin, and is found in the Euxine; it differs, however, from 
<A NAME="546"></A>the dolphin as being less in size and broader in the back; its colour is 
<A NAME="547"></A>leaden-black. Many people are of opinion that the porpoise is a variety 
<A NAME="548"></A>of the dolphin.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>All creatures that have a blow-hole respire and inspire, for they 
<A NAME="550"></A>are provided with lungs. The dolphin has been seen asleep with his nose 
<A NAME="551"></A>above water, and when asleep he snores.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR>The dolphin and the porpoise are provided with milk, and suckle 
<A NAME="553"></A>their young. They also take their young, when small, inside them. The young 
<A NAME="554"></A>of the dolphin grow rapidly, being full grown at ten years of age. Its 
<A NAME="555"></A>period of gestation is ten months. It brings forth its young summer, and 
<A NAME="556"></A>never at any other season; (and, singularly enough, under the Dogstar it 
<A NAME="557"></A>disappears for about thirty days). Its young accompany it for a considerable 
<A NAME="558"></A>period; and, in fact, the creature is remarkable for the strength of its 
<A NAME="559"></A>parental affection. It lives for many years; some are known to have lived 
<A NAME="560"></A>for more than twenty-five, and some for thirty years; the fact is fishermen 
<A NAME="561"></A>nick their tails sometimes and set them adrift again, and by this expedient 
<A NAME="562"></A>their ages are ascertained.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>The seal is an amphibious animal: that is to say, it cannot take 
<A NAME="564"></A>in water, but breathes and sleeps and brings forth on dry land-only close 
<A NAME="565"></A>to the shore-as being an animal furnished with feet; it spends, however, 
<A NAME="566"></A>the greater part of its time in the sea and derives its food from it, so 
<A NAME="567"></A>that it must be classed in the category of marine animals. It is viviparous 
<A NAME="568"></A>by immediate conception and brings forth its young alive, and exhibits 
<A NAME="569"></A>an after-birth and all else just like a ewe. It bears one or two at a time, 
<A NAME="570"></A>and three at the most. It has two teats, and suckles its young like a quadruped. 
<A NAME="571"></A>Like the human species it brings forth at all seasons of the year, but 
<A NAME="572"></A>especially at the time when the earliest kids are forthcoming. It conducts 
<A NAME="573"></A>its young ones, when they are about twelve days old, over and over again 
<A NAME="574"></A>during the day down to the sea, accustoming them by slow degrees to the 
<A NAME="575"></A>water. It slips down steep places instead of walking, from the fact that 
<A NAME="576"></A>it cannot steady itself by its feet. It can contract and draw itself in, 
<A NAME="577"></A>for it is fleshy and soft and its bones are gristly. Owing to the flabbiness 
<A NAME="578"></A>of its body it is difficult to kill a seal by a blow, unless you strike 
<A NAME="579"></A>it on the temple. It looks like a cow. The female in regard to its genital 
<A NAME="580"></A>organs resembles the female of the ray; in all other respects it resembles 
<A NAME="581"></A>the female of the human species.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>So much for the phenomena of generation and of parturition in animals 
<A NAME="583"></A>that live in water and are viviparous either internally or 
<A NAME="584"></A>externally.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="585"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR>Oviparous fishes have their womb bifurcate and placed low down, 
<A NAME="587"></A>as was said previously-and, by the way, all scaly fish are oviparous, as 
<A NAME="588"></A>the basse, the mullet, the grey mullet, and the etelis, and all the so-called 
<A NAME="589"></A>white-fish, and all the smooth or slippery fish except the eel-and their 
<A NAME="590"></A>roe is of a crumbling or granular substance. This appearance is due to 
<A NAME="591"></A>the fact that the whole womb of such fishes is full of eggs, so that in 
<A NAME="592"></A>little fishes there seem to be only a couple of eggs there; for in small 
<A NAME="593"></A>fishes the womb is indistinguishable, from its diminutive size and thin 
<A NAME="594"></A>contexture. The pairing of fishes has been discussed 
<A NAME="595"></A>previously.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>Fishes for the most part are divided into males and females, but 
<A NAME="597"></A>one is puzzled to account for the erythrinus and the channa, for specimens 
<A NAME="598"></A>of these species are never caught except in a condition of 
<A NAME="599"></A>pregnancy.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR>With such fish as pair, eggs are the result of copulation, but 
<A NAME="601"></A>such fish have them also without copulation; and this is shown in the case 
<A NAME="602"></A>of some river-fish, for the minnow has eggs when quite small,-almost, one 
<A NAME="603"></A>may say, as soon as it is born. These fishes shed their eggs little by 
<A NAME="604"></A>little, and, as is stated, the males swallow the greater part of them, 
<A NAME="605"></A>and some portion of them goes to waste in the water; but such of the eggs 
<A NAME="606"></A>as the female deposits on the spawning beds are saved. If all the eggs 
<A NAME="607"></A>were preserved, each species would be infinite in number. The greater number 
<A NAME="608"></A>of these eggs so deposited are not productive, but only those over which 
<A NAME="609"></A>the male sheds the milt or sperm; for when the female has laid her eggs, 
<A NAME="610"></A>the male follows and sheds its sperm over them, and from all the eggs so 
<A NAME="611"></A>besprinkled young fishes proceed, while the rest are left to their 
<A NAME="612"></A>fate.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR>The same phenomenon is observed in the case of molluscs also; for 
<A NAME="614"></A>in the case of the cuttlefish or sepia, after the female has deposited 
<A NAME="615"></A>her eggs, the male besprinkles them. It is highly probable that a similar 
<A NAME="616"></A>phenomenon takes place in regard to molluscs in general, though up to the 
<A NAME="617"></A>present time the phenomenon has been observed only in the case of the 
<A NAME="618"></A>cuttlefish.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>Fishes deposit their eggs close in to shore, the goby close to 
<A NAME="620"></A>stones; and, by the way, the spawn of the goby is flat and crumbly. Fish 
<A NAME="621"></A>in general so deposit their eggs; for the water close in to shore is warm 
<A NAME="622"></A>and is better supplied with food than the outer sea, and serves as a protection 
<A NAME="623"></A>to the spawn against the voracity of the larger fish. And it is for this 
<A NAME="624"></A>reason that in the Euxine most fishes spawn near the mouth of the river 
<A NAME="625"></A>Thermodon, because the locality is sheltered, genial, and supplied with 
<A NAME="626"></A>fresh water.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>Oviparous fish as a rule spawn only once a year. The little phycis 
<A NAME="628"></A>or black goby is an exception, as it spawns twice; the male of the black 
<A NAME="629"></A>goby differs from the female as being blacker and having larger 
<A NAME="630"></A>scales.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>Fishes then in general produce their young by copulation, and lay 
<A NAME="632"></A>their eggs; but the pipefish, as some call it, when the time of parturition 
<A NAME="633"></A>arrives, bursts in two, and the eggs escape out. For the fish has a diaphysis 
<A NAME="634"></A>or cloven growth under the belly and abdomen (like the blind snakes), and, 
<A NAME="635"></A>after it has spawned by the splitting of this diaphysis, the sides of the 
<A NAME="636"></A>split grow together again.
<A NAME="637"></A><BR><BR>Development from the egg takes place similarly with fishes that 
<A NAME="638"></A>are oviparous internally and with fishes that are oviparous externally; 
<A NAME="639"></A>that is to say, the embryo comes at the upper end of the egg and is enveloped 
<A NAME="640"></A>in a membrane, and the eyes, large and spherical, are the first organs 
<A NAME="641"></A>visible. From this circumstance it is plain that the assertion is untenable 
<A NAME="642"></A>which is made by some writers, to wit, that the young of oviparous fishes 
<A NAME="643"></A>are generated like the grubs of worms; for the opposite phenomena are observed 
<A NAME="644"></A>in the case of these grubs, in that their lower extremities are the larger 
<A NAME="645"></A>at the outset, and that the eyes and the head appear later on. After the 
<A NAME="646"></A>egg has been used up, the young fishes are like tadpoles in shape, and 
<A NAME="647"></A>at first, without taking any nutriment, they grow by sustenance derived 
<A NAME="648"></A>from the juice oozing from the egg; by and by, they are nourished up to 
<A NAME="649"></A>full growth by the river-waters.
<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>When the Euxine is 'purged' a substance called phycus is carried 
<A NAME="651"></A>into the Hellespont, and this substance is of a pale yellow colour. Some 
<A NAME="652"></A>writers aver that it is the flower of the phycus, from which rouge is made; 
<A NAME="653"></A>it comes at the beginning of summer. Oysters and the small fish of these 
<A NAME="654"></A>localities feed on this substance, and some of the inhabitants of these 
<A NAME="655"></A>maritime districts say that the purple murex derives its peculiar colour 
<A NAME="656"></A>from it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="657"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>Marsh-fishes and river-fishes conceive at the age of five months 
<A NAME="659"></A>as a general rule, and deposit their spawn towards the close of the year 
<A NAME="660"></A>without exception. And with these fishes, like as with the marine fishes, 
<A NAME="661"></A>the female does not void all her eggs at one time, nor the male his sperm; 
<A NAME="662"></A>but they are at all times more or less provided, the female with eggs, 
<A NAME="663"></A>and the male with sperm. The-carp spawns as the seasons come round, five 
<A NAME="664"></A>or six times, and follows in spawning the rising of the greater constellations. 
<A NAME="665"></A>The chalcis spawns three times, and the other fishes once only in the year. 
<A NAME="666"></A>They all spawn in pools left by the overflowing of rivers, and near to 
<A NAME="667"></A>reedy places in marshes; as for instance the phoxinus or minnow and the 
<A NAME="668"></A>perch.
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>The glanis or sheat-fish and the perch deposit their spawn in one 
<A NAME="670"></A>continuous string, like the frog; so continuous, in fact, is the convoluted 
<A NAME="671"></A>spawn of the perch that, by reason of its smoothness, the fishermen in 
<A NAME="672"></A>the marshes can unwind it off the reeds like threads off a reel. The larger 
<A NAME="673"></A>individuals of the sheat-fish spawn in deep waters, some in water of a 
<A NAME="674"></A>fathom's depth, the smaller in shallower water, generally close to the 
<A NAME="675"></A>roots of the willow or of some other tree, or close to reeds or to moss. 
<A NAME="676"></A>At times these fishes intertwine with one another, a big with a little 
<A NAME="677"></A>one, and bring into juxtaposition the ducts-which some writers designate 
<A NAME="678"></A>as navels-at the point where they emit the generative products and discharge 
<A NAME="679"></A>the egg in the case of the female and the milt in the case of the male. 
<A NAME="680"></A>Such eggs as are besprinkled with the milt grow, in a day or thereabouts, 
<A NAME="681"></A>whiter and larger, and in a little while afterwards the fish's eyes become 
<A NAME="682"></A>visible for these organs in all fishes, as for that matter in all other 
<A NAME="683"></A>animals, are early conspicuous and seem disproportionately big. But such 
<A NAME="684"></A>eggs as the milt fails to touch remain, as with marine fishes, useless 
<A NAME="685"></A>and infertile. From the fertile eggs, as the little fish grow, a kind of 
<A NAME="686"></A>sheath detaches itself; this is a membrane that envelops the egg and the 
<A NAME="687"></A>young fish. When the milt has mingled with the eggs, the resulting product 
<A NAME="688"></A>becomes very sticky or viscous, and adheres to the roots of trees or wherever 
<A NAME="689"></A>it may have been laid. The male keeps on guard at the principal spawning-place, 
<A NAME="690"></A>and the female after spawning goes away.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>In the case of the sheat-fish the growth from the egg is exceptionally 
<A NAME="692"></A>slow, and, in consequence, the male has to keep watch for forty or fifty 
<A NAME="693"></A>days to prevent the-spawn being devoured by such little fishes as chance 
<A NAME="694"></A>to come by. Next in point of slowness is the generation of the carp. As 
<A NAME="695"></A>with fishes in general, so even with these, the spawn thus protected disappears 
<A NAME="696"></A>and gets lost rapidly.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR>In the case of some of the smaller fishes when they are only three 
<A NAME="698"></A>days old young fishes are generated. Eggs touched by the male sperm take 
<A NAME="699"></A>on increase both the same day and also later. The egg of the sheat-fish 
<A NAME="700"></A>is as big as a vetch-seed; the egg of the carp and of the carp-species 
<A NAME="701"></A>as big as a millet-seed.
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>These fishes then spawn and generate in the way here described. 
<A NAME="703"></A>The chalcis, however, spawns in deep water in dense shoals of fish; and 
<A NAME="704"></A>the so-called tilon spawns near to beaches in sheltered spots in shoals 
<A NAME="705"></A>likewise. The carp, the baleros, and fishes in general push eagerly into 
<A NAME="706"></A>the shallows for the purpose of spawning, and very often thirteen or fourteen 
<A NAME="707"></A>males are seen following a single female. When the female deposits her 
<A NAME="708"></A>spawn and departs, the males follow on and shed the milt. The greater portion 
<A NAME="709"></A>of the spawn gets wasted; because, owing to the fact that the female moves 
<A NAME="710"></A>about while spawning, the spawn scatters, or so much of it as is caught 
<A NAME="711"></A>in the stream and does not get entangled with some rubbish. For, with the 
<A NAME="712"></A>exception of the sheatfish, no fish keeps on guard; unless, by the way, 
<A NAME="713"></A>it be the carp, which is said to remain on guard, if it so happen that 
<A NAME="714"></A>its spawn lies in a solid mass.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>All male fishes are supplied with milt, excepting the eel: with 
<A NAME="716"></A>the eel, the male is devoid of milt, and the female of spawn. The mullet 
<A NAME="717"></A>goes up from the sea to marshes and rivers; the eels, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="718"></A>make their way down from the marshes and rivers to the 
<A NAME="719"></A>sea.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="720"></A><B>Part 15</B>

<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR>The great majority of fish, then, as has been stated, proceed from 
<A NAME="722"></A>eggs. However, there are some fish that proceed from mud and sand, even 
<A NAME="723"></A>of those kinds that proceed also from pairing and the egg. This occurs 
<A NAME="724"></A>in ponds here and there, and especially in a pond in the neighbourhood 
<A NAME="725"></A>of Cnidos. This pond, it is said, at one time ran dry about the rising 
<A NAME="726"></A>of the Dogstar, and the mud had all dried up; at the first fall of the 
<A NAME="727"></A>rains there was a show of water in the pond, and on the first appearance 
<A NAME="728"></A>of the water shoals of tiny fish were found in the pond. The fish in question 
<A NAME="729"></A>was a kind of mullet, one which does not proceed from normal pairing, about 
<A NAME="730"></A>the size of a small sprat, and not one of these fishes was provided with 
<A NAME="731"></A>either spawn or milt. There are found also in Asia Minor, in rivers not 
<A NAME="732"></A>communicating with the sea, little fishes like whitebait, differing from 
<A NAME="733"></A>the small fry found near Cnidos but found under similar circumstances. 
<A NAME="734"></A>Some writers actually aver that mullet all grow spontaneously. In this 
<A NAME="735"></A>assertion they are mistaken, for the female of the fish is found provided 
<A NAME="736"></A>with spawn, and the male with milt. However, there is a species of mullet 
<A NAME="737"></A>that grows spontaneously out of mud and sand.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>From the facts above enumerated it is quite proved that certain 
<A NAME="739"></A>fishes come spontaneously into existence, not being derived from eggs or 
<A NAME="740"></A>from copulation. Such fish as are neither oviparous nor viviparous arise 
<A NAME="741"></A>all from one of two sources, from mud, or from sand and from decayed matter 
<A NAME="742"></A>that rises thence as a scum; for instance, the so-called froth of the small 
<A NAME="743"></A>fry comes out of sandy ground. This fry is incapable of growth and of propagating 
<A NAME="744"></A>its kind; after living for a while it dies away and another creature takes 
<A NAME="745"></A>its place, and so, with short intervals excepted, it may be said to last 
<A NAME="746"></A>the whole year through. At all events, it lasts from the autumn rising 
<A NAME="747"></A>of Arcturus up to the spring-time. As a proof that these fish occasionally 
<A NAME="748"></A>come out of the ground we have the fact that in cold weather they are not 
<A NAME="749"></A>caught, and that they are caught in warm weather, obviously coming up out 
<A NAME="750"></A>of the ground to catch the heat; also, when the fishermen use dredges and 
<A NAME="751"></A>the ground is scraped up fairly often, the fishes appear in larger numbers 
<A NAME="752"></A>and of superior quality. All other small fry are inferior in quality owing 
<A NAME="753"></A>to rapidity of growth. The fry are found in sheltered and marshy districts, 
<A NAME="754"></A>when after a spell of fine weather the ground is getting warmer, as, for 
<A NAME="755"></A>instance, in the neighbourhood of Athens, at Salamis and near the tomb 
<A NAME="756"></A>of Themistocles and at Marathon; for in these districts the froth is found. 
<A NAME="757"></A>It appears, then, in such districts and during such weather, and occasionally 
<A NAME="758"></A>appears after a heavy fall of rain in the froth that is thrown up by the 
<A NAME="759"></A>falling rain, from which circumstance the substance derives its specific 
<A NAME="760"></A>name. Foam is occasionally brought in on the surface of the sea in fair 
<A NAME="761"></A>weather. (And in this, where it has formed on the surface, the so-called 
<A NAME="762"></A>froth collects, as grubs swarm in manure; for which-reason this fry is 
<A NAME="763"></A>often brought in from the open sea. The fish is at its best in quality 
<A NAME="764"></A>and quantity in moist warm weather.)
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR>The ordinary fry is the normal issue of parent fishes: the so-called 
<A NAME="766"></A>gudgeon-fry of small insignificant gudgeon-like fish that burrow under 
<A NAME="767"></A>the ground. From the Phaleric fry comes the membras, from the membras the 
<A NAME="768"></A>trichis, from the trichis the trichias, and from one particular sort of 
<A NAME="769"></A>fry, to wit from that found in the harbour of Athens, comes what is called 
<A NAME="770"></A>the encrasicholus, or anchovy. There is another fry, derived from the maenis 
<A NAME="771"></A>and the mullet.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR><BR>The unfertile fry is watery and keeps only a short time, as has 
<A NAME="773"></A>been stated, for at last only head and eyes are left. However, the fishermen 
<A NAME="774"></A>of late have hit upon a method of transporting it to a distance, as when 
<A NAME="775"></A>salted it keeps for a considerable time.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="776"></A><B>Part 16</B>

<A NAME="777"></A><BR><BR>Eels are not the issue of pairing, neither are they oviparous; 
<A NAME="778"></A>nor was an eel ever found supplied with either milt or spawn, nor are they 
<A NAME="779"></A>when cut open found to have within them passages for spawn or for eggs. 
<A NAME="780"></A>In point of fact, this entire species of blooded animals proceeds neither 
<A NAME="781"></A>from pair nor from the egg.
<A NAME="782"></A><BR><BR>There can be no doubt that the case is so. For in some standing 
<A NAME="783"></A>pools, after the water has been drained off and the mud has been dredged 
<A NAME="784"></A>away, the eels appear again after a fall of rain. In time of drought they 
<A NAME="785"></A>do not appear even in stagnant ponds, for the simple reason that their 
<A NAME="786"></A>existence and sustenance is derived from rain-water.
<A NAME="787"></A><BR><BR>There is no doubt, then, that they proceed neither from pairing 
<A NAME="788"></A>nor from an egg. Some writers, however, are of opinion that they generate 
<A NAME="789"></A>their kind, because in some eels little worms are found, from which they 
<A NAME="790"></A>suppose that eels are derived. But this opinion is not founded on fact. 
<A NAME="791"></A>Eels are derived from the so-called 'earth's guts' that grow spontaneously 
<A NAME="792"></A>in mud and in humid ground; in fact, eels have at times been seen to emerge 
<A NAME="793"></A>out of such earthworms, and on other occasions have been rendered visible 
<A NAME="794"></A>when the earthworms were laid open by either scraping or cutting. Such 
<A NAME="795"></A>earthworms are found both in the sea and in rivers, especially where there 
<A NAME="796"></A>is decayed matter: in the sea in places where sea-weed abounds, and in 
<A NAME="797"></A>rivers and marshes near to the edge; for it is near to the water's edge 
<A NAME="798"></A>that sun-heat has its chief power and produces putrefaction. So much for 
<A NAME="799"></A>the generation of the eel.

<A NAME="801"></A><BR><BR>Fish do not all bring forth their young at the same season nor 
<A NAME="802"></A>all in like manner, neither is the period of gestation for all of the same 
<A NAME="803"></A>duration.
<A NAME="804"></A><BR><BR>Before pairing the males and females gather together in shoals; 
<A NAME="805"></A>at the time for copulation and parturition they pair off. With some fishes 
<A NAME="806"></A>the time of gestation is not longer than thirty days, with others it is 
<A NAME="807"></A>a lesser period; but with all it extends over a number of days divisible 
<A NAME="808"></A>by seven. The longest period of gestation is that of the species which 
<A NAME="809"></A>some call a marinus.
<A NAME="810"></A><BR><BR>The sargue conceives during the month of Poseideon (or December), 
<A NAME="811"></A>and carries its spawn for thirty days; and the species of mullet named 
<A NAME="812"></A>by some the chelon, and the myxon, go with spawn at the same period and 
<A NAME="813"></A>over the same length of time.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR><BR>All fish suffer greatly during the period of gestation, and are 
<A NAME="815"></A>in consequence very apt to be thrown up on shore at this time. In some 
<A NAME="816"></A>cases they are driven frantic with pain and throw themselves on land. At 
<A NAME="817"></A>all events they are throughout this time continually in motion until parturition 
<A NAME="818"></A>is over (this being especially true of the mullet), and after parturition 
<A NAME="819"></A>they are in repose. With many fish the time for parturition terminates 
<A NAME="820"></A>on the appearance of grubs within the belly; for small living grubs get 
<A NAME="821"></A>generated there and eat up the spawn.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR>With shoal fishes parturition takes place in the spring, and indeed, 
<A NAME="823"></A>with most fishes, about the time of the spring equinox; with others it 
<A NAME="824"></A>is at different times, in summer with some, and with others about the autumn 
<A NAME="825"></A>equinox.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR>The first of shoal fishes to spawn is the atherine, and it spawns 
<A NAME="827"></A>close to land; the last is the cephalus: and this is inferred from the 
<A NAME="828"></A>fact that the brood of the atherine appears first of all and the brood 
<A NAME="829"></A>of the cephalus last. The mullet also spawns early. The saupe spawns usually 
<A NAME="830"></A>at the beginning of summer, but occasionally in the autumn. The aulopias, 
<A NAME="831"></A>which some call the anthias, spawns in the summer. Next in order of spawning 
<A NAME="832"></A>comes the chrysophrys or gilthead, the basse, the mormyrus, and in general 
<A NAME="833"></A>such fish as are nicknamed 'runners'. Latest in order of the shoal fish 
<A NAME="834"></A>come the red mullet and the coracine; these spawn in autumn. The red mullet 
<A NAME="835"></A>spawns on mud, and consequently, as the mud continues cold for a long while, 
<A NAME="836"></A>spawns late in the year. The coracine carries its spawn for a long time; 
<A NAME="837"></A>but, as it lives usually on rocky ground, it goes to a distance and spawns 
<A NAME="838"></A>in places abounding in seaweed, at a period later than the red mullet. 
<A NAME="839"></A>The maenis spawns about the winter solstice. Of the others, such as are 
<A NAME="840"></A>pelagic spawn for the most part in summer; which fact is proved by their 
<A NAME="841"></A>not being caught by fishermen during this period.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR><BR>Of ordinary fishes the most prolific is the sprat; of cartilaginous 
<A NAME="843"></A>fishes, the fishing-frog. Specimens, however, of the fishing-frog are rare 
<A NAME="844"></A>from the facility with which the young are destroyed, as the female lays 
<A NAME="845"></A>her spawn all in a lump close in to shore. As a rule, cartilaginous fish 
<A NAME="846"></A>are less prolific than other fish owing to their being viviparous; and 
<A NAME="847"></A>their young by reason of their size have a better chance of escaping 
<A NAME="848"></A>destruction.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR><BR>The so-called needle-fish (or pipe-fish) is late in spawning, and 
<A NAME="850"></A>the greater portion of them are burst asunder by the eggs before spawning; 
<A NAME="851"></A>and the eggs are not so many in number as large in size. The young fish 
<A NAME="852"></A>cluster round the parent like so many young spiders, for the fish spawns 
<A NAME="853"></A>on to herself; and, if any one touch the young, they swim away. The atherine 
<A NAME="854"></A>spawns by rubbing its belly against the sand.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR>Tunny fish also burst asunder by reason of their fat. They live 
<A NAME="856"></A>for two years; and the fishermen infer this age from the circumstance that 
<A NAME="857"></A>once when there was a failure of the young tunny fish for a year there 
<A NAME="858"></A>was a failure of the full-grown tunny the next summer. They are of opinion 
<A NAME="859"></A>that the tunny is a fish a year older than the pelamyd. The tunny and the 
<A NAME="860"></A>mackerel pair about the close of the month of Elaphebolion, and spawn about 
<A NAME="861"></A>the commencement of the month of Hecatombaeon; they deposit their spawn 
<A NAME="862"></A>in a sort of bag. The growth of the young tunny is rapid. After the females 
<A NAME="863"></A>have spawned in the Euxine, there comes from the egg what some call scordylae, 
<A NAME="864"></A>but what the Byzantines nickname the 'auxids' or 'growers', from their 
<A NAME="865"></A>growing to a considerable size in a few days; these fish go out of the 
<A NAME="866"></A>Pontus in autumn along with the young tunnies, and enter Pontus in the 
<A NAME="867"></A>spring as pelamyds. Fishes as a rule take on growth with rapidity, but 
<A NAME="868"></A>this is peculiarly the case with all species of fish found in the Pontus; 
<A NAME="869"></A>the growth, for instance, of the amia-tunny is quite visible from day to 
<A NAME="870"></A>day.
<A NAME="871"></A><BR><BR>To resume, we must bear in mind that the same fish in the same 
<A NAME="872"></A>localities have not the same season for pairing, for conception, for parturition, 
<A NAME="873"></A>or for favouring weather. The coracine, for instance, in some places spawns 
<A NAME="874"></A>about wheat-harvest. The statements here given pretend only to give the 
<A NAME="875"></A>results of general observation.
<A NAME="876"></A><BR><BR>The conger also spawns, but the fact is not equally obvious in 
<A NAME="877"></A>all localities, nor is the spawn plainly visible owing to the fat of the 
<A NAME="878"></A>fish; for the spawn is lanky in shape as it is with serpents. However, 
<A NAME="879"></A>if it be put on the fire it shows its nature; for the fat evaporates and 
<A NAME="880"></A>melts, while the eggs dance about and explode with a crack. Further, if 
<A NAME="881"></A>you touch the substances and rub them with your fingers, the fat feels 
<A NAME="882"></A>smooth and the egg rough. Some congers are provided with fat but not with 
<A NAME="883"></A>any spawn, others are unprovided with fat but have egg-spawn as here 
<A NAME="884"></A>described.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="885"></A><B>Part 18</B>

<A NAME="886"></A><BR><BR>We have, then, treated pretty fully of the animals that fly in 
<A NAME="887"></A>the air or swim in the water, and of such of those that walk on dry land 
<A NAME="888"></A>as are oviparous, to wit of their pairing, conception, and the like phenomena; 
<A NAME="889"></A>it now remains to treat of the same phenomena in connexion with viviparous 
<A NAME="890"></A>land animals and with man.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR><BR>The statements made in regard to the pairing of the sexes apply 
<A NAME="892"></A>partly to the particular kinds of animal and partly to all in general. 
<A NAME="893"></A>It is common to all animals to be most excited by the desire of one sex 
<A NAME="894"></A>for the other and by the pleasure derived from copulation. The female is 
<A NAME="895"></A>most cross-tempered just after parturition, the male during the time of 
<A NAME="896"></A>pairing; for instance, stallions at this period bite one another, throw 
<A NAME="897"></A>their riders, and chase them. Wild boars, though usually enfeebled at this 
<A NAME="898"></A>time as the result of copulation, are now unusually fierce, and fight with 
<A NAME="899"></A>one another in an extraordinary way, clothing themselves with defensive 
<A NAME="900"></A>armour, or in other words deliberately thickening their hide by rubbing 
<A NAME="901"></A>against trees or by coating themselves repeatedly all over with mud and 
<A NAME="902"></A>then drying themselves in the sun. They drive one another away from the 
<A NAME="903"></A>swine pastures, and fight with such fury that very often both combatants 
<A NAME="904"></A>succumb. The case is similar with bulls, rams, and he-goats; for, though 
<A NAME="905"></A>at ordinary times they herd together, at breeding time they hold aloof 
<A NAME="906"></A>from and quarrel with one another. The male camel also is cross-tempered 
<A NAME="907"></A>at pairing time if either a man or a camel comes near him; as for a horse, 
<A NAME="908"></A>a camel is ready to fight him at any time. It is the same with wild animals. 
<A NAME="909"></A>The bear, the wolf, and the lion are all at this time ferocious towards 
<A NAME="910"></A>such as come in their way, but the males of these animals are less given 
<A NAME="911"></A>to fight with one another from the fact that they are at no time gregarious. 
<A NAME="912"></A>The she-bear is fierce after cubbing, and the bitch after 
<A NAME="913"></A>pupping.
<A NAME="914"></A><BR><BR>Male elephants get savage about pairing time, and for this reason 
<A NAME="915"></A>it is stated that men who have charge of elephants in India never allow 
<A NAME="916"></A>the males to have intercourse with the females; on the ground that the 
<A NAME="917"></A>males go wild at this time and turn topsy-turvy the dwellings of their 
<A NAME="918"></A>keepers, lightly constructed as they are, and commit all kinds of havoc. 
<A NAME="919"></A>They also state that abundancy of food has a tendency to tame the males. 
<A NAME="920"></A>They further introduce other elephants amongst the wild ones, and punish 
<A NAME="921"></A>and break them in by setting on the new-comers to chastise the 
<A NAME="922"></A>others.
<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR>Animals that pair frequently and not at a single specific season, 
<A NAME="924"></A>as for instance animals domesticated by man, such as swine and dogs, are 
<A NAME="925"></A>found to indulge in such freaks to a lesser degree owing to the frequency 
<A NAME="926"></A>of their sexual intercourse.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR>Of female animals the mare is the most sexually wanton, and next 
<A NAME="928"></A>in order comes the cow. In fact, the mare is said to go a-horsing; and 
<A NAME="929"></A>the term derived from the habits of this one animal serves as a term of 
<A NAME="930"></A>abuse applicable to such females of the human species as are unbridled 
<A NAME="931"></A>in the way of sexual appetite. This is the common phenomenon as observed 
<A NAME="932"></A>in the sow when she is said to go a-boaring. The mare is said also about 
<A NAME="933"></A>this time to get wind-impregnated if not impregnated by the stallion, and 
<A NAME="934"></A>for this reason in Crete they never remove the stallion from the mares; 
<A NAME="935"></A>for when the mare gets into this condition she runs away from all other 
<A NAME="936"></A>horses. The mares under these circumstances fly invariably either northwards 
<A NAME="937"></A>or southwards, and never towards either east or west. When this complaint 
<A NAME="938"></A>is on them they allow no one to approach, until either they are exhausted 
<A NAME="939"></A>with fatigue or have reached the sea. Under either of these circumstances 
<A NAME="940"></A>they discharge a certain substance 'hippomanes', the title given to a growth 
<A NAME="941"></A>on a new-born foal; this resembles the sow-virus, and is in great request 
<A NAME="942"></A>amongst women who deal in drugs and potions. About horsing time the mares 
<A NAME="943"></A>huddle closer together, are continually switching their tails, their neigh 
<A NAME="944"></A>is abnormal in sound, and from the sexual organ there flows a liquid resembling 
<A NAME="945"></A>genital sperm, but much thinner than the sperm of the male. It is this 
<A NAME="946"></A>substance that some call hippomanes, instead of the growth found on the 
<A NAME="947"></A>foal; they say it is extremely difficult to get as it oozes out only in 
<A NAME="948"></A>small drops at a time. Mares also, when in heat, discharge urine frequently, 
<A NAME="949"></A>and frisk with one another. Such are the phenomena connected with the 
<A NAME="950"></A>horse.
<A NAME="951"></A><BR><BR>Cows go a-bulling; and so completely are they under the influence 
<A NAME="952"></A>of the sexual excitement that the herdsmen have no control over them and 
<A NAME="953"></A>cannot catch hold of them in the fields. Mares and kine alike, when in 
<A NAME="954"></A>heat, indicate the fact by the upraising of their genital organs, and by 
<A NAME="955"></A>continually voiding urine. Further, kine mount the bulls, follow them about; 
<A NAME="956"></A>and keep standing beside them. The younger females both with horses and 
<A NAME="957"></A>oxen are the first to get in heat; and their sexual appetites are all the 
<A NAME="958"></A>keener if the weather warm and their bodily condition be healthy. Mares, 
<A NAME="959"></A>when clipt of their coat, have the sexual feeling checked, and assume a 
<A NAME="960"></A>downcast drooping appearance. The stallion recognizes by the scent the 
<A NAME="961"></A>mares that form his company, even though they have been together only a 
<A NAME="962"></A>few days before breeding time: if they get mixed up with other mares, the 
<A NAME="963"></A>stallion bites and drives away the interlopers. He feeds apart, accompanied 
<A NAME="964"></A>by his own troop of mares. Each stallion has assigned to him about thirty 
<A NAME="965"></A>mares or even somewhat more; when a strange stallion approaches, he huddles 
<A NAME="966"></A>his mares into a close ring, runs round them, then advances to the encounter 
<A NAME="967"></A>of the newcomer; if one of the mares make a movement, he bites her and 
<A NAME="968"></A>drives her back. The bull in breeding time begins to graze with the cows, 
<A NAME="969"></A>and fights with other bulls (having hitherto grazed with them), which is 
<A NAME="970"></A>termed by graziers 'herd-spurning'. Often in Epirus a bull disappears for 
<A NAME="971"></A>three months together. In a general way one may state that of male animals 
<A NAME="972"></A>either none or few herd with their respective females before breeding time; 
<A NAME="973"></A>but they keep separate after reaching maturity, and the two sexes feed 
<A NAME="974"></A>apart. Sows, when they are moved by sexual desire, or are, as it is called, 
<A NAME="975"></A>a-boaring, will attack even human beings.
<A NAME="976"></A><BR><BR>With bitches the same sexual condition is termed 'getting into 
<A NAME="977"></A>heat'. The sexual organ rises at this time, and there is a moisture about 
<A NAME="978"></A>the parts. Mares drip with a white liquid at this season.
<A NAME="979"></A><BR><BR>Female animals are subject to menstrual discharges, but never in 
<A NAME="980"></A>such-abundance as is the female of the human species. With ewes and she-goats 
<A NAME="981"></A>there are signs of menstruation in breeding time, just before the for submitting 
<A NAME="982"></A>to the male; after copulation also the signs are manifest, and then cease 
<A NAME="983"></A>for an interval until the period of parturition arrives; the process then 
<A NAME="984"></A>supervenes, and it is by this supervention that the shepherd knows that 
<A NAME="985"></A>such and such an ewe is about to bring forth. After parturition comes copious 
<A NAME="986"></A>menstruation, not at first much tinged with blood, but deeply dyed with 
<A NAME="987"></A>it by and by. With the cow, the she ass, and the mare, the discharge is 
<A NAME="988"></A>more copious actually, owing to their greater bulk, but proportionally 
<A NAME="989"></A>to the greater bulk it is far less copious. The cow, for instance, when 
<A NAME="990"></A>in heat, exhibits a small discharge to the extent of a quarter of a pint 
<A NAME="991"></A>of liquid or a little less; and the time when this discharge takes place 
<A NAME="992"></A>is the best time for her to be covered by the bull. Of all quadrupeds the 
<A NAME="993"></A>mare is the most easily delivered of its young, exhibits the least amount 
<A NAME="994"></A>of discharge after parturition, and emits the least amount of blood; that 
<A NAME="995"></A>is to say, of all animals in proportion to size. With kine and mares menstruation 
<A NAME="996"></A>usually manifests itself at intervals of two, four, and six months; but, 
<A NAME="997"></A>unless one be constantly attending to and thoroughly acquainted with such 
<A NAME="998"></A>animals, it is difficult to verify the circumstance, and the result is 
<A NAME="999"></A>that many people are under the belief that the process never takes place 
<A NAME="1000"></A>with these animals at all.
<A NAME="1001"></A><BR><BR>With mules menstruation never takes place, but the urine of the 
<A NAME="1002"></A>female is thicker than the urine of the male. As a general rule the discharge 
<A NAME="1003"></A>from the bladder in the case of quadrupeds is thicker than it is in the 
<A NAME="1004"></A>human species, and this discharge with ewes and she-goats is thicker than 
<A NAME="1005"></A>with rams and he-goats; but the urine of the jackass is thicker than the 
<A NAME="1006"></A>urine of the she-ass, and the urine of the bull is more pungent than the 
<A NAME="1007"></A>urine of the cow. After parturition the urine of all quadrupeds becomes 
<A NAME="1008"></A>thicker, especially with such animals as exhibit comparatively slight discharges. 
<A NAME="1009"></A>At breeding time the milk become purulent, but after parturition it becomes 
<A NAME="1010"></A>wholesome. During pregnancy ewes and she-goats get fatter and eat more; 
<A NAME="1011"></A>as is also the case with cows, and, indeed, with the females of all 
<A NAME="1012"></A>quadrupeds.
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR><BR>In general the sexual appetites of animals are keenest in spring-time; 
<A NAME="1014"></A>the time of pairing, however, is not the same for all, but is adapted so 
<A NAME="1015"></A>as to ensure the rearing of the young at a convenient 
<A NAME="1016"></A>season.
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR><BR>Domesticated swine carry their young for four months, and bring 
<A NAME="1018"></A>forth a litter of twenty at the utmost; and, by the way, if the litter 
<A NAME="1019"></A>be exceedingly numerous they cannot rear all the young. As the sow grows 
<A NAME="1020"></A>old she continues to bear, but grows indifferent to the boar; she conceives 
<A NAME="1021"></A>after a single copulation, but they have to put the boar to her repeatedly 
<A NAME="1022"></A>owing to her dropping after intercourse what is called the sow-virus. This 
<A NAME="1023"></A>incident befalls all sows, but some of them discharge the genital sperm 
<A NAME="1024"></A>as well. During conception any one of the litter that gets injured or dwarfed 
<A NAME="1025"></A>is called an afterpig or scut: such injury may occur at any part of the 
<A NAME="1026"></A>womb. After littering the mother offers the foremost teat to the first-born. 
<A NAME="1027"></A>When the sow is in heat, she must not at once be put to the boar, but only 
<A NAME="1028"></A>after she lets her lugs drop, for otherwise she is apt to get into heat 
<A NAME="1029"></A>again; if she be put to the boar when in full condition of heat, one copulation, 
<A NAME="1030"></A>as has been said, is sufficient. It is as well to supply the boar at the 
<A NAME="1031"></A>period of copulation with barley, and the sow at the time of parturition 
<A NAME="1032"></A>with boiled barley. Some swine give fine litters only at the beginning, 
<A NAME="1033"></A>with others the litters improve as the mothers grow in age and size. It 
<A NAME="1034"></A>is said that a sow, if she have one of her eyes knocked out, is almost 
<A NAME="1035"></A>sure to die soon afterwards. Swine for the most part live for fifteen years, 
<A NAME="1036"></A>but some fall little short of the twenty.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1037"></A><B>Part 19</B>

<A NAME="1038"></A><BR><BR>Ewes conceive after three or four copulations with the ram. If 
<A NAME="1039"></A>rain falls after intercourse, the ram impregnates the ewe again; and it 
<A NAME="1040"></A>is the same with the she-goat. The ewe bears usually two lambs, sometimes 
<A NAME="1041"></A>three or four. Both ewe and she-goat carry their young for five months; 
<A NAME="1042"></A>consequently wherever a district is sunny and the animals are used to comfort 
<A NAME="1043"></A>and well fed, they bear twice in the year. The goat lives for eight years 
<A NAME="1044"></A>and the sheep for ten, but in most cases not so long; the bell-wether, 
<A NAME="1045"></A>however, lives to fifteen years. In every flock they train one of the rams 
<A NAME="1046"></A>for bell-wether. When he is called on by name by the shepherd, he takes 
<A NAME="1047"></A>the lead of the flock: and to this duty the creature is trained from its 
<A NAME="1048"></A>earliest years. Sheep in Ethiopia live for twelve or thirteen years, goats 
<A NAME="1049"></A>for ten or eleven. In the case of the sheep and the goat the two sexes 
<A NAME="1050"></A>have intercourse all their lives long.
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR><BR>Twins with sheep and goats may be due to richness of pasturage, 
<A NAME="1052"></A>or to the fact that either the ram or the he-goat is a twin-begetter or 
<A NAME="1053"></A>that the ewe or the she-goat is a twin-bearer. Of these animals some give 
<A NAME="1054"></A>birth to males and others to females; and the difference in this respect 
<A NAME="1055"></A>depends on the waters they drink and also on the sires. And if they submit 
<A NAME="1056"></A>to the male when north winds are blowing, they are apt to bear males; if 
<A NAME="1057"></A>when south winds are blowing, females. Such as bear females may get to 
<A NAME="1058"></A>bear males, due regard being paid to their looking northwards when put 
<A NAME="1059"></A>to the male. Ewes accustomed to be put to the ram early will refuse him 
<A NAME="1060"></A>if he attempt to mount them late. Lambs are born white and black according 
<A NAME="1061"></A>as white or black veins are under the ram's tongue; the lambs are white 
<A NAME="1062"></A>if the veins are white, and black if the veins are black, and white and 
<A NAME="1063"></A>black if the veins are white and black; and red if the veins are red. The 
<A NAME="1064"></A>females that drink salted waters are the first to take the male; the water 
<A NAME="1065"></A>should be salted before and after parturition, and again in the springtime. 
<A NAME="1066"></A>With goats the shepherds appoint no bell-wether, as the animal is not capable 
<A NAME="1067"></A>of repose but frisky and apt to ramble. If at the appointed season the 
<A NAME="1068"></A>elders of the flock are eager for intercourse, the shepherds say that it 
<A NAME="1069"></A>bodes well for the flock; if the younger ones, that the flock is going 
<A NAME="1070"></A>to be bad.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1071"></A><B>Part 20</B>

<A NAME="1072"></A><BR><BR>Of dogs there are several breeds. Of these the Laconian hound of 
<A NAME="1073"></A>either sex is fit for breeding purposes when eight months old: at about 
<A NAME="1074"></A>the same age some dogs lift the leg when voiding urine. The bitch conceives 
<A NAME="1075"></A>with one lining; this is clearly seen in the case where a dog contrives 
<A NAME="1076"></A>to line a bitch by stealth, as they impregnate after mounting only once. 
<A NAME="1077"></A>The Laconian bitch carries her young the sixth part of a year or sixty 
<A NAME="1078"></A>days: or more by one, two, or three, or less by one; the pups are blind 
<A NAME="1079"></A>for twelve days after birth. After pupping, the bitch gets in heat again 
<A NAME="1080"></A>in six months, but not before. Some bitches carry their young for the fifth 
<A NAME="1081"></A>part of the year or for seventy-two days; and their pups are blind for 
<A NAME="1082"></A>fourteen days. Other bitches carry their young for a quarter of a year 
<A NAME="1083"></A>or for three whole months; and the whelps of these are blind for seventeen 
<A NAME="1084"></A>days. The bitch appears go in heat for the same length of time. Menstruation 
<A NAME="1085"></A>continues for seven days, and a swelling of the genital organ occurs simultaneously; 
<A NAME="1086"></A>it is not during this period that the bitch is disposed to submit to the 
<A NAME="1087"></A>dog, but in the seven days that follow. The bitch as a rule goes in heat 
<A NAME="1088"></A>for fourteen days, but occasionally for sixteen. The birth-discharge occurs 
<A NAME="1089"></A>simultaneously with the delivery of the whelps, and the substance of it 
<A NAME="1090"></A>is thick and mucous. (The falling-off in bulk on the part of the mother 
<A NAME="1091"></A>is not so great as might have been inferred from the size of her frame.) 
<A NAME="1092"></A>The bitch is usually supplied with milk five days before parturition; some 
<A NAME="1093"></A>seven days previously, some four; and the milk is serviceable immediately 
<A NAME="1094"></A>after birth. The Laconian bitch is supplied with milk thirty days after 
<A NAME="1095"></A>lining. The milk at first is thickish, but gets thinner by degrees; with 
<A NAME="1096"></A>the bitch the milk is thicker than with the female of any other animal 
<A NAME="1097"></A>excepting the sow and the hare. When the bitch arrives at full growth an 
<A NAME="1098"></A>indication is given of her capacity for the male; that is to say, just 
<A NAME="1099"></A>as occurs in the female of the human species, a swelling takes place in 
<A NAME="1100"></A>the teats of the breasts, and the breasts take on gristle. This incident, 
<A NAME="1101"></A>however, it is difficult for any but an expert to detect, as the part that 
<A NAME="1102"></A>gives the indication is inconsiderable. The preceding statements relate 
<A NAME="1103"></A>to the female, and not one of them to the male. The male as a rule lifts 
<A NAME="1104"></A>his leg to void urine when six months old; some at a later period, when 
<A NAME="1105"></A>eight months old, some before they reach six months. In a general way one 
<A NAME="1106"></A>may put it that they do so when they are out of puppyhood. The bitch squats 
<A NAME="1107"></A>down when she voids urine; it is a rare exception that she lifts the leg 
<A NAME="1108"></A>to do so. The bitch bears twelve pups at the most, but usually five or 
<A NAME="1109"></A>six; occasionally a bitch will bear one only. The bitch of the Laconian 
<A NAME="1110"></A>breed generally bears eight. The two sexes have intercourse with each other 
<A NAME="1111"></A>at all periods of life. A very remarkable phenomenon is observed in the 
<A NAME="1112"></A>case of the Laconian hound: in other words, he is found to be more vigorous 
<A NAME="1113"></A>in commerce with the female after being hard-worked than when allowed to 
<A NAME="1114"></A>live idle.
