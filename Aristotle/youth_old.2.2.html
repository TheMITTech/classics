<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 14</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>We have already stated that life and the presence of soul involve a certain 
<A NAME="12"></A>heat. Not even the digesting process to which is due the nutrition of animals 
<A NAME="13"></A>occurs apart from soul and warmth, for it is to fire that in all cases 
<A NAME="14"></A>elaboration is due. It is for this reason, precisely, that the primary 
<A NAME="15"></A>nutritive soul also must be located in that part of the body and in that 
<A NAME="16"></A>division of this region which is the immediate vehicle of this principle. 
<A NAME="17"></A>The region in question is intermediate between that where food enters and 
<A NAME="18"></A>that where excrement is discharged. In bloodless animals it has no name, 
<A NAME="19"></A>but in the sanguineous class this organ is called the heart. The blood 
<A NAME="20"></A>constitutes the nutriment from which the organs of the animal are directly 
<A NAME="21"></A>formed. Likewise the bloodvessels must have the same originating source, 
<A NAME="22"></A>since the one exists for the other's behoof-as a vessel or receptacle for 
<A NAME="23"></A>it. In sanguineous animals the heart is the starting-point of the veins; 
<A NAME="24"></A>they do not traverse it, but are found to stretch out from it, as dissections 
<A NAME="25"></A>enable us to see.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>Now the other psychical faculties cannot exist apart from the power 
<A NAME="27"></A>of nutrition (the reason has already been stated in the treatise On the 
<A NAME="28"></A>Soul), and this depends on the natural fire, by the union with which Nature 
<A NAME="29"></A>has set it aglow. But fire, as we have already stated, is destroyed in 
<A NAME="30"></A>two ways, either by extinction or by exhaustion. It suffers extinction 
<A NAME="31"></A>from its opposites. Hence it can be extinguished by the surrounding cold 
<A NAME="32"></A>both when in mass and (though more speedily) when scattered. Now this way 
<A NAME="33"></A>of perishing is due to violence equally in living and in lifeless objects, 
<A NAME="34"></A>for the division of an animal by instruments and consequent congelation 
<A NAME="35"></A>by excess of cold cause death. But exhaustion is due to excess of heat; 
<A NAME="36"></A>if there is too much heat close at hand and the thing burning does not 
<A NAME="37"></A>have a fresh supply of fuel added to it, it goes out by exhaustion, not 
<A NAME="38"></A>by the action of cold. Hence, if it is going to continue it must be cooled, 
<A NAME="39"></A>for cold is a preventive against this form of extinction.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="40"></A><B>Part 15</B>
<A NAME="41"></A>Some animals occupy the water, others live on land, and, that being so, 
<A NAME="42"></A>in the case of those which are very small and bloodless the refrigeration 
<A NAME="43"></A>due to the surrounding water or air is sufficient to prevent destruction 
<A NAME="44"></A>from this cause. Having little heat, they require little cold to combat 
<A NAME="45"></A>it. Hence too such animals are almost all short-lived, for, being small, 
<A NAME="46"></A>they have less scope for deflection towards either extreme. But some insects 
<A NAME="47"></A>are longer-lived though bloodless, like all the others), and these have 
<A NAME="48"></A>a deep indentation beneath the waist, in order to secure cooling through 
<A NAME="49"></A>the membrane, which there is thinner. They are warmer animals and hence 
<A NAME="50"></A>require more refrigeration, and such are bees (some of which live as long 
<A NAME="51"></A>as seven years) and all that make a humming noise, like wasps, cockchafers, 
<A NAME="52"></A>and crickets. They make a sound as if of panting by means of air, for, 
<A NAME="53"></A>in the middle section itself, the air which exists internally and is involved 
<A NAME="54"></A>in their construction, causing a rising and falling movement, produces 
<A NAME="55"></A>friction against the membrane. The way in which they move this region is 
<A NAME="56"></A>like the motion due to the lungs in animals that breathe the outer air, 
<A NAME="57"></A>or to the gills in fishes. What occurs is comparable to the suffocation 
<A NAME="58"></A>of a respiring animal by holding its mouth, for then the lung causes a 
<A NAME="59"></A>heaving motion of this kind. In the case of these animals this internal 
<A NAME="60"></A>motion is not sufficient for refrigeration, but in insects it is. It is 
<A NAME="61"></A>by friction against the membrane that they produce the humming sound, as 
<A NAME="62"></A>we said, in the way that children do by blowing through the holes of a 
<A NAME="63"></A>reed covered by a fine membrane. It is thus that the singing crickets too 
<A NAME="64"></A>produce their song; they possess greater warmth and are indented at the 
<A NAME="65"></A>waist, but the songless variety have no fissure there.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>Animals also which are sanguineous and possess a lung, though that 
<A NAME="67"></A>contains little blood and is spongy, can in some cases, owing to the latter 
<A NAME="68"></A>fact, live a long time without breathing; for the lung, containing little 
<A NAME="69"></A>blood or fluid, can rise a long way: its own motion can for a long time 
<A NAME="70"></A>produce sufficient refrigeration. But at last it ceases to suffice, and 
<A NAME="71"></A>the animal dies of suffocation if it does not respire-as we have already 
<A NAME="72"></A>said. For of exhaustion that kind which is destruction due to lack of refrigeration 
<A NAME="73"></A>is called suffocation, and whatsoever is thus destroyed is said to be 
<A NAME="74"></A>suffocated.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>We have already stated that among animals insects do not respire, 
<A NAME="76"></A>and the fact is open to observation in the case of even small creatures 
<A NAME="77"></A>like flies and bees, for they can swim about in a fluid for a long time 
<A NAME="78"></A>if it is not too hot or too cold. Yet animals with little strength tend 
<A NAME="79"></A>to breathe more frequently. These, however, die of what is called suffocation 
<A NAME="80"></A>when the stomach becomes filled and the heat in the central segment is 
<A NAME="81"></A>destroyed. This explains also why they revive after being among ashes for 
<A NAME="82"></A>a time.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>Again among water-animals those that are bloodless remain alive 
<A NAME="84"></A>longer in air than those that have blood and admit the sea-water, as, for 
<A NAME="85"></A>example, fishes. Since it is a small quantity of heat they possess, the 
<A NAME="86"></A>air is for a long time adequate for the purposes of refrigeration in such 
<A NAME="87"></A>animals as the crustacea and the polyps. It does not however suffice, owing 
<A NAME="88"></A>to their want of heat, to keep them finally in life, for most fishes also 
<A NAME="89"></A>live though among earth, yet in a motionless state, and are to be found 
<A NAME="90"></A>by digging. For all animals that have no lung at all or have a bloodless 
<A NAME="91"></A>one require less refrigeration.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="92"></A><B>Part 16</B>

<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>Concerning the bloodless animals we have declared that in some 
<A NAME="94"></A>cases it is the surrounding air, in others fluid, that aids the maintenance 
<A NAME="95"></A>of life. But in the case of animals possessing blood and heart, all which 
<A NAME="96"></A>have a lung admit the air and produce the cooling effect by breathing in 
<A NAME="97"></A>and out. All animals have a lung that are viviparous and are so internally, 
<A NAME="98"></A>not externally merely (the Selachia are viviparous, but not internally), 
<A NAME="99"></A>and of the oviparous class those that have wings, e.g. birds, and those 
<A NAME="100"></A>with scales, e.g. tortoises, lizards, and snakes. The former class have 
<A NAME="101"></A>a lung charged with blood, but in the most part of the latter it is spongy. 
<A NAME="102"></A>Hence they employ respiration more sparingly as already said. The function 
<A NAME="103"></A>is found also in all that frequent and pass their life in the water, e.g. 
<A NAME="104"></A>the class of water-snakes and frogs and crocodiles and hemydes, both sea- 
<A NAME="105"></A>and land-tortoises, and seals.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>All these and similar animals both bring forth on land and sleep 
<A NAME="107"></A>on shore or, when they do so in the water, keep the head above the surface 
<A NAME="108"></A>in order to respire. But all with gills produce refrigeration by taking 
<A NAME="109"></A>in water; the Selachia and all other footless animals have gills. Fish 
<A NAME="110"></A>are footless, and the limbs they have get their name (pterugion) from their 
<A NAME="111"></A>similarity to wings (pterux). But of those with feet one only, so far as 
<A NAME="112"></A>observed, has gills. It is called the tadpole.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>No animal yet has been seen to possess both lungs and gills, and 
<A NAME="114"></A>the reason for this is that the lung is designed for the purpose of refrigeration 
<A NAME="115"></A>by means of the air (it seems to have derived its name (pneumon) from its 
<A NAME="116"></A>function as a receptacle of the breath (pneuma)), while gills are relevant 
<A NAME="117"></A>to refrigeration by water. Now for one purpose one organ is adapted and 
<A NAME="118"></A>one single means of refrigeration is sufficient in every case. Hence, since 
<A NAME="119"></A>we see that Nature does nothing in vain, and if there were two organs one 
<A NAME="120"></A>would be purposeless, this is the reason why some animals have gills, others 
<A NAME="121"></A>lungs, but none possess both.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="122"></A><B>Part 17</B>

<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>Every animal in order to exist requires nutriment, in order to 
<A NAME="124"></A>prevent itself from dying, refrigeration; and so Nature employs the same 
<A NAME="125"></A>organ for both purposes. For, as in some cases the tongue serves both for 
<A NAME="126"></A>discerning tastes and for speech, so in animals with lungs the mouth is 
<A NAME="127"></A>employed both in working up the food and in the passage of the breath outwards 
<A NAME="128"></A>and inwards. In lungless and non-respiring animals it is employed in working 
<A NAME="129"></A>up the food, while in those of them that require refrigeration it is the 
<A NAME="130"></A>gills that are created for this purpose.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>We shall state further on how it is that these organs have the 
<A NAME="132"></A>faculty of producing refrigeration. But to prevent their food from impeding 
<A NAME="133"></A>these operations there is a similar contrivance in the respiring animals 
<A NAME="134"></A>and in those that admit water. At the moment of respiration they do not 
<A NAME="135"></A>take in food, for otherwise suffocation results owing to the food, whether 
<A NAME="136"></A>liquid or dry, slipping in through the windpipe and lying on the lung. 
<A NAME="137"></A>The windpipe is situated before the oesophagus, through which food passes 
<A NAME="138"></A>into what is called the stomach, but in quadrupeds which are sanguineous 
<A NAME="139"></A>there is, as it were, a lid over the windpipe-the epiglottis. In birds 
<A NAME="140"></A>and oviparous quadrupeds this covering is absent, but its office is discharged 
<A NAME="141"></A>by a contraction of the windpipe. The latter class contract the windpipe 
<A NAME="142"></A>when swallowing their food; the former close down the epiglottis. When 
<A NAME="143"></A>the food has passed, the epiglottis is in the one case raised, and in the 
<A NAME="144"></A>other the windpipe is expanded, and the air enters to effect refrigeration. 
<A NAME="145"></A>In animals with gills the water is first discharged through them and then 
<A NAME="146"></A>the food passes in through the mouth; they have no windpipe and hence can 
<A NAME="147"></A>take no harm from liquid lodging in this organ, only from its entering 
<A NAME="148"></A>the stomach. For these reasons the expulsion of water and the seizing of 
<A NAME="149"></A>their food is rapid, and their teeth are sharp and in almost all cases 
<A NAME="150"></A>arranged in a saw-like fashion, for they are debarred from chewing their 
<A NAME="151"></A>food.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="152"></A><B>Part 18</B>

<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>Among water-animals the cetaceans may give rise to some perplexity, 
<A NAME="154"></A>though they too can be rationally explained.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Examples of such animals are dolphins and whales, and all others 
<A NAME="156"></A>that have a blowhole. They have no feet, yet possess a lung though admitting 
<A NAME="157"></A>the sea-water. The reason for possessing a lung is that which we have now 
<A NAME="158"></A>stated [refrigeration]; the admission of water is not for the purpose of 
<A NAME="159"></A>refrigeration. That is effected by respiration, for they have a lung. Hence 
<A NAME="160"></A>they sleep with their head out of the water, and dolphins, at any rate, 
<A NAME="161"></A>snore. Further, if they are entangled in nets they soon die of suffocation 
<A NAME="162"></A>owing to lack of respiration, and hence they can be seen to come to the 
<A NAME="163"></A>surface owing to the necessity of breathing. But, since they have to feed 
<A NAME="164"></A>in the water, they must admit it, and it is in order to discharge this 
<A NAME="165"></A>that they all have a blow-hole; after admitting the water they expel it 
<A NAME="166"></A>through the blow-hole as the fishes do through the gills. The position 
<A NAME="167"></A>of the blow-hole is an indication of this, for it leads to none of the 
<A NAME="168"></A>organs which are charged with blood; but it lies before the brain and thence 
<A NAME="169"></A>discharges water.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR><BR>It is for the very same reason that molluscs and crustaceans admit 
<A NAME="171"></A>water-I mean such animals as Carabi and Carcini. For none of these is refrigeration 
<A NAME="172"></A>a necessity, for in every case they have little heat and are bloodless, 
<A NAME="173"></A>and hence are sufficiently cooled by the surrounding water. But in feeding 
<A NAME="174"></A>they admit water, and hence must expel it in order to prevent its being 
<A NAME="175"></A>swallowed simultaneously with the food. Thus crustaceans, like the Carcini 
<A NAME="176"></A>and Carabi, discharge water through the folds beside their shaggy parts, 
<A NAME="177"></A>while cuttlefish and the polyps employ for this purpose the hollow above 
<A NAME="178"></A>the head. There is, however, a more precise account of these in the History 
<A NAME="179"></A>of Animals.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>Thus it has been explained that the cause of the admission of the 
<A NAME="181"></A>water is refrigeration, and the fact that animals constituted for a life 
<A NAME="182"></A>in water must feed in it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="183"></A><B>Part 19</B>

<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>An account must next be given of refrigeration and the manner in 
<A NAME="185"></A>which it occurs in respiring animals and those possessed of gills. We have 
<A NAME="186"></A>already said that all animals with lungs respire. The reason why some creatures 
<A NAME="187"></A>have this organ, and why those having it need respiration, is that the 
<A NAME="188"></A>higher animals have a greater proportion of heat, for at the same time 
<A NAME="189"></A>they must have been assigned a higher soul and they have a higher nature 
<A NAME="190"></A>than plants. Hence too those with most blood and most warmth in the lung 
<A NAME="191"></A>are of greater size, and animal in which the blood in the lung is purest 
<A NAME="192"></A>and most plentiful is the most erect, namely man; and the reason why he 
<A NAME="193"></A>alone has his upper part directed to the upper part of the universe is 
<A NAME="194"></A>that he possesses such a lung. Hence this organ as much as any other must 
<A NAME="195"></A>be assigned to the essence of the animal both in man and in other 
<A NAME="196"></A>cases.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>This then is the purpose of refrigeration. As for the constraining 
<A NAME="198"></A>and efficient cause, we must believe that it created animals like this, 
<A NAME="199"></A>just as it created many others also not of this constitution. For some 
<A NAME="200"></A>have a greater proportion of earth in their composition, like plants, and 
<A NAME="201"></A>others, e.g. aquatic animals, contain a larger amount of water; while winged 
<A NAME="202"></A>and terrestrial animals have an excess of air and fire respectively. It 
<A NAME="203"></A>is always in the region proper to the element preponderating in the scheme 
<A NAME="204"></A>of their constitution that things exist.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="205"></A><B>Part 20</B>

<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>Empedocles is then in error when he says that those animals which 
<A NAME="207"></A>have the most warmth and fire live in the water to counterbalance the excess 
<A NAME="208"></A>of heat in their constitution, in order that, since they are deficient 
<A NAME="209"></A>in cold and fluid, they may be kept in life by the contrary character of 
<A NAME="210"></A>the region they occupy; for water has less heat than air. But it is wholly 
<A NAME="211"></A>absurd that the water-animals should in every case originate on dry land, 
<A NAME="212"></A>and afterwards change their place of abode to the water; for they are almost 
<A NAME="213"></A>all footless. He, however, when describing their original structure says 
<A NAME="214"></A>that, though originating on dry land, they have abandoned it and migrated 
<A NAME="215"></A>to the water. But again it is evident that they are not warmer than land-animals, 
<A NAME="216"></A>for in some cases they have no blood at all, in others 
<A NAME="217"></A>little.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>The question, however, as to what sorts of animals should be called 
<A NAME="219"></A>warm and what cold, has in each special case received consideration. Though 
<A NAME="220"></A>in one respect there is reason in the explanation which Empedocles aims 
<A NAME="221"></A>at establishing, yet his account is not correct. Excess in a bodily state 
<A NAME="222"></A>is cured by a situation or season of opposite character, but the constitution 
<A NAME="223"></A>is best maintained by an environment akin to it. There is a difference 
<A NAME="224"></A>between the material of which any animal is constituted and the states 
<A NAME="225"></A>and dispositions of that material. For example, if nature were to constitute 
<A NAME="226"></A>a thing of wax or of ice, she would not preserve it by putting it in a 
<A NAME="227"></A>hot place, for the opposing quality would quickly destroy it, seeing that 
<A NAME="228"></A>heat dissolves that which cold congeals. Again, a thing composed of salt 
<A NAME="229"></A>or nitre would not be taken and placed in water, for fluid dissolves that 
<A NAME="230"></A>of which the consistency is due to the hot and the dry.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>Hence if the fluid and the dry supply the material for all bodies, 
<A NAME="232"></A>it is reasonable that things the composition of which is due to the fluid 
<A NAME="233"></A>and the cold should have liquid for their medium [and, if they are cold, 
<A NAME="234"></A>they will exist in the cold], while that which is due to the dry will be 
<A NAME="235"></A>found in the dry. Thus trees grow not in water but on dry land. But the 
<A NAME="236"></A>same theory would relegate them to the water, on account of their excess 
<A NAME="237"></A>of dryness, just as it does the things that are excessively fiery. They 
<A NAME="238"></A>would migrate thither not on account of its cold but owing to its 
<A NAME="239"></A>fluidity.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>Thus the natural character of the material of objects is of the 
<A NAME="241"></A>same nature as the region in which they exist; the liquid is found in liquid, 
<A NAME="242"></A>the dry on land, the warm in air. With regard, however, to states of body, 
<A NAME="243"></A>a cold situation has, on the other hand, a beneficial effect on excess 
<A NAME="244"></A>of heat, and a warm environment on excess of cold, for the region reduces 
<A NAME="245"></A>to a mean the excess in the bodily condition. The regions appropriate to 
<A NAME="246"></A>each material and the revolutions of the seasons which all experience supply 
<A NAME="247"></A>the means which must be sought in order to correct such excesses; but, 
<A NAME="248"></A>while states of the body can be opposed in character to the environment, 
<A NAME="249"></A>the material of which it is composed can never be so. This, then, is a 
<A NAME="250"></A>sufficient explanation of why it is not owing to the heat in their constitution 
<A NAME="251"></A>that some animals are aquatic, others terrestrial, as Empedocles maintains, 
<A NAME="252"></A>and of why some possess lungs and others do not.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="253"></A><B>Part 21</B>

<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>The explanation of the admission of air and respiration in those 
<A NAME="255"></A>animals in which a lung is found, and especially in those in which it is 
<A NAME="256"></A>full of blood, is to be found in the fact that it is of a spongy nature 
<A NAME="257"></A>and full of tubes, and that it is the most fully charged with blood of 
<A NAME="258"></A>all the visceral organs. All animals with a full-blooded lung require rapid 
<A NAME="259"></A>refrigeration because there is little scope for deviation from the normal 
<A NAME="260"></A>amount of their vital fire; the air also must penetrate all through it 
<A NAME="261"></A>on account of the large quantity of blood and heat it contains. But both 
<A NAME="262"></A>these operations can be easily performed by air, for, being of a subtle 
<A NAME="263"></A>nature, it penetrates everywhere and that rapidly, and so performs its 
<A NAME="264"></A>cooling function; but water has the opposite characteristics.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>The reason why animals with a full-blooded lung respire most is 
<A NAME="266"></A>hence manifest; the more heat there is, the greater is the need for refrigeration, 
<A NAME="267"></A>and at the same time breath can easily pass to the source of heat in the 
<A NAME="268"></A>heart.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="269"></A><B>Part 22</B>

<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>In order to understand the way in which the heart is connected 
<A NAME="271"></A>with the lung by means of passages, we must consult both dissections and 
<A NAME="272"></A>the account in the History of Animals. The universal cause of the need 
<A NAME="273"></A>which the animal has for refrigeration, is the union of the soul with fire 
<A NAME="274"></A>that takes place in the heart. Respiration is the means of effecting refrigeration, 
<A NAME="275"></A>of which those animals make use that possess a lung as well as a heart. 
<A NAME="276"></A>But when they, as for example the fishes, which on account of their aquatic 
<A NAME="277"></A>nature have no lung, possess the latter organ without the former, the cooling 
<A NAME="278"></A>is effected through the gills by means of water. For ocular evidence as 
<A NAME="279"></A>to how the heart is situated relatively to the gills we must employ dissections, 
<A NAME="280"></A>and for precise details we must refer to Natural History. As a summarizing 
<A NAME="281"></A>statement, however, and for present purposes, the following is the account 
<A NAME="282"></A>of the matter.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>It might appear that the heart has not the same position in terrestrial 
<A NAME="284"></A>animals and fishes, but the position really is identical, for the apex 
<A NAME="285"></A>of the heart is in the direction in which they incline their heads. But 
<A NAME="286"></A>it is towards the mouth in fishes that the apex of the heart points, seeing 
<A NAME="287"></A>that they do not incline their heads in the same direction as land-animals 
<A NAME="288"></A>do. Now from the extremity of the heart a tube of a sinewy, arterial character 
<A NAME="289"></A>runs to the centre where the gills all join. This then is the largest of 
<A NAME="290"></A>those ducts, but on either side of the heart others also issue and run 
<A NAME="291"></A>to the extremity of each gill, and by means of the ceaseless flow of water 
<A NAME="292"></A>through the gills, effect the cooling which passes to the 
<A NAME="293"></A>heart.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>In similar fashion as the fish move their gills, respiring animals 
<A NAME="295"></A>with rapid action raise and let fall the chest according as the breath 
<A NAME="296"></A>is admitted or expelled. If air is limited in amount and unchanged they 
<A NAME="297"></A>are suffocated, for either medium, owing to contact with the blood, rapidly 
<A NAME="298"></A>becomes hot. The heat of the blood counteracts the refrigeration and, when 
<A NAME="299"></A>respiring animals can no longer move the lung aquatic animals their gills, 
<A NAME="300"></A>whether owing to discase or old age, their death ensues.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="301"></A><B>Part 23</B>

<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>To be born and to die are common to all animals, but there are 
<A NAME="303"></A>specifically diverse ways in which these phenomena occur; of destruction 
<A NAME="304"></A>there are different types, though yet something is common to them all. 
<A NAME="305"></A>There is violent death and again natural death, and the former occurs when 
<A NAME="306"></A>the cause of death is external, the latter when it is internal, and involved 
<A NAME="307"></A>from the beginning in the constitution of the organ, and not an affection 
<A NAME="308"></A>derived from a foreign source. In the case of plants the name given to 
<A NAME="309"></A>this is withering, in animals senility. Death and decay pertain to all 
<A NAME="310"></A>things that are not imperfectly developed; to the imperfect also they may 
<A NAME="311"></A>be ascribed in nearly the same but not an identical sense. Under the imperfect 
<A NAME="312"></A>I class eggs and seeds of plants as they are before the root 
<A NAME="313"></A>appears.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>It is always to some lack of heat that death is due, and in perfect 
<A NAME="315"></A>creatures the cause is its failure in the organ containing the source of 
<A NAME="316"></A>the creature's essential nature. This member is situate, as has been said, 
<A NAME="317"></A>at the junction of the upper and lower parts; in plants it is intermediate 
<A NAME="318"></A>between the root and the stem, in sanguineous animals it is the heart, 
<A NAME="319"></A>and in those that are bloodless the corresponding part of their body. But 
<A NAME="320"></A>some of these animals have potentially many sources of life, though in 
<A NAME="321"></A>actuality they possess only one. This is why some insects live when divided, 
<A NAME="322"></A>and why, even among sanguineous animals, all whose vitality is not intense 
<A NAME="323"></A>live for a long time after the heart has been removed. Tortoises, for example, 
<A NAME="324"></A>do so and make movements with their feet, so long as the shell is left, 
<A NAME="325"></A>a fact to be explained by the natural inferiority of their constitution, 
<A NAME="326"></A>as it is in insects also.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>The source of life is lost to its possessors when the heat with 
<A NAME="328"></A>which it is bound up is no longer tempered by cooling, for, as I have often 
<A NAME="329"></A>remarked, it is consumed by itself. Hence when, owing to lapse of time, 
<A NAME="330"></A>the lung in the one class and the gills in the other get dried up, these 
<A NAME="331"></A>organs become hard and earthy and incapable of movement, and cannot be 
<A NAME="332"></A>expanded or contracted. Finally things come to a climax, and the fire goes 
<A NAME="333"></A>out from exhaustion.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>Hence a small disturbance will speedily cause death in old age. 
<A NAME="335"></A>Little heat remains, for the most of it has been breathed away in the long 
<A NAME="336"></A>period of life preceding, and hence any increase of strain on the organ 
<A NAME="337"></A>quickly causes extinction. It is just as though the heart contained a tiny 
<A NAME="338"></A>feeble flame which the slightest movement puts out. Hence in old age death 
<A NAME="339"></A>is painless, for no violent disturbance is required to cause death, and 
<A NAME="340"></A>there is an entire absence of feeling when the soul's connexion is severed. 
<A NAME="341"></A>All diseases which harden the lung by forming tumours or waste residues, 
<A NAME="342"></A>or by excess of morbid heat, as happens in fevers, accelerate the breathing 
<A NAME="343"></A>owing to the inability of the lung to move far either upwards or downwards. 
<A NAME="344"></A>Finally, when motion is no longer possible, the breath is given out and 
<A NAME="345"></A>death ensues.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="346"></A><B>Part 24</B>

<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>Generation is the initial participation, mediated by warm substance, 
<A NAME="348"></A>in the nutritive soul, and life is the maintenance of this participation. 
<A NAME="349"></A>Youth is the period of the growth of the primary organ of refrigeration, 
<A NAME="350"></A>old age of its decay, while the intervening time is the prime of 
<A NAME="351"></A>life.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>A violent death or dissolution consists in the extinction or exhaustion 
<A NAME="353"></A>of the vital heat (for either of these may cause dissolution), while natural 
<A NAME="354"></A>death is the exhaustion of the heat owing to lapse of time, and occurring 
<A NAME="355"></A>at the end of life. In plants this is to wither, in animals to die. Death, 
<A NAME="356"></A>in old age, is the exhaustion due to inability on the part of the organ, 
<A NAME="357"></A>owing to old age, to produce refrigeration. This then is our account of 
<A NAME="358"></A>generation and life and death, and the reason for their occurrence in 
<A NAME="359"></A>animals.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="360"></A><B>Part 25</B>

<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>It is hence also clear why respiring animals are suffocated in 
<A NAME="362"></A>water and fishes in air. For it is by water in the latter class, by air 
<A NAME="363"></A>in the former that refrigeration is effected, and either of these means 
<A NAME="364"></A>of performing the function is removed by a change of 
<A NAME="365"></A>environment.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>There is also to be explained in either case the cause of the cause 
<A NAME="367"></A>of the motion of the gills and of the lungs, the rise and fall of which 
<A NAME="368"></A>effects the admission and expulsion of the breath or of water. The following, 
<A NAME="369"></A>moreover, is the manner of the constitution of the organ.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="370"></A><B>Part 26</B>

<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>In connexion with the heart there are three phenomena, which, though 
<A NAME="372"></A>apparently of the same nature, are really not so, namely palpitation, pulsation, 
<A NAME="373"></A>and respiration.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>Palpitation is the rushing together of the hot substance in the 
<A NAME="375"></A>heart owing to the chilling influence of residual or waste products. It 
<A NAME="376"></A>occurs, for example, in the ailment known as 'spasms' and in other diseases. 
<A NAME="377"></A>It occurs also in fear, for when one is afraid the upper parts become cold, 
<A NAME="378"></A>and the hot substance, fleeing away, by its concentration in the heart 
<A NAME="379"></A>produces palpitation. It is crushed into so small a space that sometimes 
<A NAME="380"></A>life is extinguished, and the animals die of the fright and morbid 
<A NAME="381"></A>disturbance.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>The beating of the heart, which, as can be seen, goes on continuously, 
<A NAME="383"></A>is similar to the throbbing of an abscess. That, however, is accompanied 
<A NAME="384"></A>by pain, because the change produced in the blood is unnatural, and it 
<A NAME="385"></A>goes on until the matter formed by concoction is discharged. There is a 
<A NAME="386"></A>similarity between this phenomenon and that of boiling; for boiling is 
<A NAME="387"></A>due to the volatilization of fluid by heat and the expansion consequent 
<A NAME="388"></A>on increase of bulk. But in an abscess, if there is no evaporation through 
<A NAME="389"></A>the walls, the process terminates in suppuration due to the thickening 
<A NAME="390"></A>of the liquid, while in boiling it ends in the escape of the fluid out 
<A NAME="391"></A>of the containing vessel.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>In the heart the beating is produced by the heat expanding the 
<A NAME="393"></A>fluid, of which the food furnishes a constant supply. It occurs when the 
<A NAME="394"></A>fluid rises to the outer wall of the heart, and it goes on continuously; 
<A NAME="395"></A>for there is a constant flow of the fluid that goes to constitute the blood, 
<A NAME="396"></A>it being in the heart that the blood receives its primary elaboration. 
<A NAME="397"></A>That this is so we can perceive in the initial stages of generation, for 
<A NAME="398"></A>the heart can be seen to contain blood before the veins become distinct. 
<A NAME="399"></A>This explains why pulsation in youth exceeds that in older people, for 
<A NAME="400"></A>in the young the formation of vapour is more abundant.
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR>All the veins pulse, and do so simultaneously with each other, 
<A NAME="402"></A>owing to their connexion with the heart. The heart always beats, and hence 
<A NAME="403"></A>they also beat continuously and simultaneously with each other and with 
<A NAME="404"></A>it.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>Palpitation, then, is the recoil of the heart against the compression 
<A NAME="406"></A>due to cold; and pulsation is the volatilization of the heated 
<A NAME="407"></A>fluid.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="408"></A><B>Part 27</B>

<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>Respiration takes place when the hot substance which is the seat 
<A NAME="410"></A>of the nutritive principle increases. For it, like the rest of the body, 
<A NAME="411"></A>requires nutrition, and more so than the members, for it is through it 
<A NAME="412"></A>that they are nourished. But when it increases it necessarily causes the 
<A NAME="413"></A>organ to rise. This organ we must to be constructed like the bellows in 
<A NAME="414"></A>a smithy, for both heart and lungs conform pretty well to this shape. Such 
<A NAME="415"></A>a structure must be double, for the nutritive principle must be situated 
<A NAME="416"></A>in the centre of the natural force.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>Thus on increase of bulk expansion results, which necessarily causes 
<A NAME="418"></A>the surrounding parts to rise. Now this can be seen to occur when people 
<A NAME="419"></A>respire; they raise their chest because the motive principle of the organ 
<A NAME="420"></A>described resident within the chest causes an identical expansion of this 
<A NAME="421"></A>organ. When it dilates the outer air must rush in as into a bellows, and, 
<A NAME="422"></A>being cold, by its chilling influence reduces by extinction the excess 
<A NAME="423"></A>of the fire. But, as the increase of bulk causes the organ to dilate, so 
<A NAME="424"></A>diminution causes contraction, and when it collapses the air which entered 
<A NAME="425"></A>must pass out again. When it enters the air is cold, but on issuing it 
<A NAME="426"></A>is warm owing to its contact with the heat resident in this organ, and 
<A NAME="427"></A>this is specially the case in those animals that possess a full-blooded 
<A NAME="428"></A>lung. The numerous canal-like ducts in the lung, into which it passes, 
<A NAME="429"></A>have each a blood-vessel lying alongside, so that the whole lung is thought 
<A NAME="430"></A>to be full of blood. The inward passage of the air is called respiration, 
<A NAME="431"></A>the outward expiration, and this double movement goes on continuously just 
<A NAME="432"></A>so long as the animal lives and keeps this organ in continuous motion; 
<A NAME="433"></A>it is for this reason that life is bound up with the passage of the breath 
<A NAME="434"></A>outwards and inwards.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>It is in the same way that the motion of the gills in fishes takes 
<A NAME="436"></A>place. When the hot substance in the blood throughout the members rises, 
<A NAME="437"></A>the gills rise too, and let the water pass through, but when it is chilled 
<A NAME="438"></A>and retreats through its channels to the heart, they contract and eject 
<A NAME="439"></A>the water. Continually as the heat in the heart rises, continually on being 
<A NAME="440"></A>chilled it returns thither again. Hence, as in respiring animals life and 
<A NAME="441"></A>death are bound up with respiration, so in the other animals class they 
<A NAME="442"></A>depend on the admission of water.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>Our discussion of life and death and kindred topics is now practically 
<A NAME="444"></A>complete. But health and discase also claim the attention of the scientist, 
<A NAME="445"></A>and not mercly of the physician, in so far as an account of their causes 
<A NAME="446"></A>is concerned. The extent to which these two differ and investigate diverse 
<A NAME="447"></A>provinces must not escape us, since facts show that their inquiries are, 
<A NAME="448"></A>to a certain extent, at least conterminous. For physicians of culture and 
<A NAME="449"></A>refinement make some mention of natural science, and claim to derive their 
<A NAME="450"></A>principles from it, while the most accomplished investigators into nature 
<A NAME="451"></A>generally push their studies so far as to conclude with an account of medical 
<A NAME="452"></A>principles.
