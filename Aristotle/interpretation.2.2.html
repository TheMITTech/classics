<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 11</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>There is no unity about an affirmation or denial which, either positively 
<A NAME="12"></A>or negatively, predicates one thing of many subjects, or many things of 
<A NAME="13"></A>the same subject, unless that which is indicated by the many is really 
<A NAME="14"></A>some one thing. do not apply this word 'one' to those things which, though 
<A NAME="15"></A>they have a single recognized name, yet do not combine to form a unity. 
<A NAME="16"></A>Thus, man may be an animal, and biped, and domesticated, but these three 
<A NAME="17"></A>predicates combine to form a unity. On the other hand, the predicates 'white', 
<A NAME="18"></A>'man', and 'walking' do not thus combine. Neither, therefore, if these 
<A NAME="19"></A>three form the subject of an affirmation, nor if they form its predicate, 
<A NAME="20"></A>is there any unity about that affirmation. In both cases the unity is linguistic, 
<A NAME="21"></A>but not real.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>If therefore the dialectical question is a request for an answer, 
<A NAME="23"></A>i.e. either for the admission of a premiss or for the admission of one 
<A NAME="24"></A>of two contradictories-and the premiss is itself always one of two contradictories-the 
<A NAME="25"></A>answer to such a question as contains the above predicates cannot be a 
<A NAME="26"></A>single proposition. For as I have explained in the Topics, question is 
<A NAME="27"></A>not a single one, even if the answer asked for is true.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>At the same time it is plain that a question of the form 'what 
<A NAME="29"></A>is it?' is not a dialectical question, for a dialectical questioner must 
<A NAME="30"></A>by the form of his question give his opponent the chance of announcing 
<A NAME="31"></A>one of two alternatives, whichever he wishes. He must therefore put the 
<A NAME="32"></A>question into a more definite form, and inquire, e.g.. whether man has 
<A NAME="33"></A>such and such a characteristic or not.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>Some combinations of predicates are such that the separate predicates 
<A NAME="35"></A>unite to form a single predicate. Let us consider under what conditions 
<A NAME="36"></A>this is and is not possible. We may either state in two separate propositions 
<A NAME="37"></A>that man is an animal and that man is a biped, or we may combine the two, 
<A NAME="38"></A>and state that man is an animal with two feet. Similarly we may use 'man' 
<A NAME="39"></A>and 'white' as separate predicates, or unite them into one. Yet if a man 
<A NAME="40"></A>is a shoemaker and is also good, we cannot construct a composite proposition 
<A NAME="41"></A>and say that he is a good shoemaker. For if, whenever two separate predicates 
<A NAME="42"></A>truly belong to a subject, it follows that the predicate resulting from 
<A NAME="43"></A>their combination also truly belongs to the subject, many absurd results 
<A NAME="44"></A>ensue. For instance, a man is man and white. Therefore, if predicates may 
<A NAME="45"></A>always be combined, he is a white man. Again, if the predicate 'white' 
<A NAME="46"></A>belongs to him, then the combination of that predicate with the former 
<A NAME="47"></A>composite predicate will be permissible. Thus it will be right to say that 
<A NAME="48"></A>he is a white man so on indefinitely. Or, again, we may combine the predicates 
<A NAME="49"></A>'musical', 'white', and 'walking', and these may be combined many times. 
<A NAME="50"></A>Similarly we may say that Socrates is Socrates and a man, and that therefore 
<A NAME="51"></A>he is the man Socrates, or that Socrates is a man and a biped, and that 
<A NAME="52"></A>therefore he is a two-footed man. Thus it is manifest that if man states 
<A NAME="53"></A>unconditionally that predicates can always be combined, many absurd consequences 
<A NAME="54"></A>ensue.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>We will now explain what ought to be laid down.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR>Those predicates, and terms forming the subject of predication, which 
<A NAME="57"></A>are accidental either to the same subject or to one another, do not combine 
<A NAME="58"></A>to form a unity. Take the proposition 'man is white of complexion and musical'. 
<A NAME="59"></A>Whiteness and being musical do not coalesce to form a unity, for they belong 
<A NAME="60"></A>only accidentally to the same subject. Nor yet, if it were true to say 
<A NAME="61"></A>that that which is white is musical, would the terms 'musical' and 'white' 
<A NAME="62"></A>form a unity, for it is only incidentally that that which is musical is 
<A NAME="63"></A>white; the combination of the two will, therefore, not form a 
<A NAME="64"></A>unity.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>Thus, again, whereas, if a man is both good and a shoemaker, we 
<A NAME="66"></A>cannot combine the two propositions and say simply that he is a good shoemaker, 
<A NAME="67"></A>we are, at the same time, able to combine the predicates 'animal' and 'biped' 
<A NAME="68"></A>and say that a man is an animal with two feet, for these predicates are 
<A NAME="69"></A>not accidental.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>Those predicates, again, cannot form a unity, of which the one 
<A NAME="71"></A>is implicit in the other: thus we cannot combine the predicate 'white' 
<A NAME="72"></A>again and again with that which already contains the notion 'white', nor 
<A NAME="73"></A>is it right to call a man an animal-man or a two-footed man; for the notions 
<A NAME="74"></A>'animal' and 'biped' are implicit in the word 'man'. On the other hand, 
<A NAME="75"></A>it is possible to predicate a term simply of any one instance, and to say 
<A NAME="76"></A>that some one particular man is a man or that some one white man is a white 
<A NAME="77"></A>man.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>Yet this is not always possible: indeed, when in the adjunct there 
<A NAME="79"></A>is some opposite which involves a contradiction, the predication of the 
<A NAME="80"></A>simple term is impossible. Thus it is not right to call a dead man a man. 
<A NAME="81"></A>When, however, this is not the case, it is not impossible.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>Yet the facts of the case might rather be stated thus: when some 
<A NAME="83"></A>such opposite elements are present, resolution is never possible, but when 
<A NAME="84"></A>they are not present, resolution is nevertheless not always possible. Take 
<A NAME="85"></A>the proposition 'Homer is so-and-so', say 'a poet'; does it follow that 
<A NAME="86"></A>Homer is, or does it not? The verb 'is' is here used of Homer only incidentally, 
<A NAME="87"></A>the proposition being that Homer is a poet, not that he is, in the independent 
<A NAME="88"></A>sense of the word.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>Thus, in the case of those predications which have within them 
<A NAME="90"></A>no contradiction when the nouns are expanded into definitions, and wherein 
<A NAME="91"></A>the predicates belong to the subject in their own proper sense and not 
<A NAME="92"></A>in any indirect way, the individual may be the subject of the simple propositions 
<A NAME="93"></A>as well as of the composite. But in the case of that which is not, it is 
<A NAME="94"></A>not true to say that because it is the object of opinion, it is; for the 
<A NAME="95"></A>opinion held about it is that it is not, not that it 
<A NAME="96"></A>is.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="97"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>As these distinctions have been made, we must consider the mutual 
<A NAME="99"></A>relation of those affirmations and denials which assert or deny possibility 
<A NAME="100"></A>or contingency, impossibility or necessity: for the subject is not without 
<A NAME="101"></A>difficulty.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>We admit that of composite expressions those are contradictory 
<A NAME="103"></A>each to each which have the verb 'to be' its positive and negative form 
<A NAME="104"></A>respectively. Thus the contradictory of the proposition 'man is' is 'man 
<A NAME="105"></A>is not', not 'not-man is', and the contradictory of 'man is white' is 'man 
<A NAME="106"></A>is not white', not 'man is not-white'. For otherwise, since either the 
<A NAME="107"></A>positive or the negative proposition is true of any subject, it will turn 
<A NAME="108"></A>out true to say that a piece of wood is a man that is not 
<A NAME="109"></A>white.
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>Now if this is the case, in those propositions which do not contain 
<A NAME="111"></A>the verb 'to be' the verb which takes its place will exercise the same 
<A NAME="112"></A>function. Thus the contradictory of 'man walks' is 'man does not walk', 
<A NAME="113"></A>not 'not-man walks'; for to say 'man walks' merely equivalent to saying 
<A NAME="114"></A>'man is walking'.
<A NAME="115"></A><BR><BR>If then this rule is universal, the contradictory of 'it may be' 
<A NAME="116"></A>is may not be', not 'it cannot be'.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>Now it appears that the same thing both may and may not be; for 
<A NAME="118"></A>instance, everything that may be cut or may walk may also escape cutting 
<A NAME="119"></A>and refrain from walking; and the reason is that those things that have 
<A NAME="120"></A>potentiality in this sense are not always actual. In such cases, both the 
<A NAME="121"></A>positive and the negative propositions will be true; for that which is 
<A NAME="122"></A>capable of walking or of being seen has also a potentiality in the opposite 
<A NAME="123"></A>direction.
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>But since it is impossible that contradictory propositions should 
<A NAME="125"></A>both be true of the same subject, it follows that' it may not be' is not 
<A NAME="126"></A>the contradictory of 'it may be'. For it is a logical consequence of what 
<A NAME="127"></A>we have said, either that the same predicate can be both applicable and 
<A NAME="128"></A>inapplicable to one and the same subject at the same time, or that it is 
<A NAME="129"></A>not by the addition of the verbs 'be' and 'not be', respectively, that 
<A NAME="130"></A>positive and negative propositions are formed. If the former of these alternatives 
<A NAME="131"></A>must be rejected, we must choose the latter.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>The contradictory, then, of 'it may be' is 'it cannot be'. The 
<A NAME="133"></A>same rule applies to the proposition 'it is contingent that it should be'; 
<A NAME="134"></A>the contradictory of this is 'it is not contingent that it should be'. 
<A NAME="135"></A>The similar propositions, such as 'it is necessary' and 'it is impossible', 
<A NAME="136"></A>may be dealt with in the same manner. For it comes about that just as in 
<A NAME="137"></A>the former instances the verbs 'is' and 'is not' were added to the subject-matter 
<A NAME="138"></A>of the sentence 'white' and 'man', so here 'that it should be' and 'that 
<A NAME="139"></A>it should not be' are the subject-matter and 'is possible', 'is contingent', 
<A NAME="140"></A>are added. These indicate that a certain thing is or is not possible, just 
<A NAME="141"></A>as in the former instances 'is' and 'is not' indicated that certain things 
<A NAME="142"></A>were or were not the case.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>The contradictory, then, of 'it may not be' is not 'it cannot be', 
<A NAME="144"></A>but 'it cannot not be', and the contradictory of 'it may be' is not 'it 
<A NAME="145"></A>may not be', but cannot be'. Thus the propositions 'it may be' and 'it 
<A NAME="146"></A>may not be' appear each to imply the other: for, since these two propositions 
<A NAME="147"></A>are not contradictory, the same thing both may and may not be. But the 
<A NAME="148"></A>propositions 'it may be' and 'it cannot be' can never be true of the same 
<A NAME="149"></A>subject at the same time, for they are contradictory. Nor can the propositions 
<A NAME="150"></A>'it may not be' and 'it cannot not be' be at once true of the same 
<A NAME="151"></A>subject.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>The propositions which have to do with necessity are governed by 
<A NAME="153"></A>the same principle. The contradictory of 'it is necessary that it should 
<A NAME="154"></A>be', is not 'it is necessary that it should not be,' but 'it is not necessary 
<A NAME="155"></A>that it should be', and the contradictory of 'it is necessary that it should 
<A NAME="156"></A>not be' is 'it is not necessary that it should not be'.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Again, the contradictory of 'it is impossible that it should be' 
<A NAME="158"></A>is not 'it is impossible that it should not be' but 'it is not impossible 
<A NAME="159"></A>that it should be', and the contradictory of 'it is impossible that it 
<A NAME="160"></A>should not be' is 'it is not impossible that it should not 
<A NAME="161"></A>be'.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>To generalize, we must, as has been stated, define the clauses 
<A NAME="163"></A>'that it should be' and 'that it should not be' as the subject-matter of 
<A NAME="164"></A>the propositions, and in making these terms into affirmations and denials 
<A NAME="165"></A>we must combine them with 'that it should be' and 'that it should not be' 
<A NAME="166"></A>respectively.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>We must consider the following pairs as contradictory 
<A NAME="168"></A>propositions:
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>It may be.              It cannot be.
<A NAME="170"></A><BR>It is contingent.       It is not contingent.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR>It is impossible.       It is not impossible.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR>It is necessary.        It is not necessary.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR>It is true.             It is not true.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="174"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>Logical sequences follow in due course when we have arranged the 
<A NAME="176"></A>propositions thus. From the proposition 'it may be' it follows that it 
<A NAME="177"></A>is contingent, and the relation is reciprocal. It follows also that it 
<A NAME="178"></A>is not impossible and not necessary.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>From the proposition 'it may not be' or 'it is contingent that 
<A NAME="180"></A>it should not be' it follows that it is not necessary that it should not 
<A NAME="181"></A>be and that it is not impossible that it should not be. From the proposition 
<A NAME="182"></A>'it cannot be' or 'it is not contingent' it follows that it is necessary 
<A NAME="183"></A>that it should not be and that it is impossible that it should be. From 
<A NAME="184"></A>the proposition 'it cannot not be' or 'it is not contingent that it should 
<A NAME="185"></A>not be' it follows that it is necessary that it should be and that it is 
<A NAME="186"></A>impossible that it should not be.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>Let us consider these statements by the help of a 
<A NAME="188"></A>table:
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR><B>A.                       B.</B>
<A NAME="190"></A><BR>It may be.                   It cannot be.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR>It is contingent.            It is not contingent.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR>It is not impossible         It is impossible that 
<A NAME="193"></A>it
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR><B>that it should be.           should be.</B>
<A NAME="195"></A><BR>It is not necessary          It is necessary that 
<A NAME="196"></A>it
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR><B>that it should be.           should not be.</B>
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR><B>C.                       D.</B>
<A NAME="199"></A><BR>It may not be.               It cannot not be.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR>It is contingent that it     It is not contingent 
<A NAME="201"></A>that
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR><B>should not be.               it should not 
<A NAME="203"></A>be.</B>
<A NAME="204"></A><BR>It is not impossible         It is impossible thatit
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR><B>that it should not be.       should not be.</B>
<A NAME="206"></A><BR>It is not necessary that     It is necessary that 
<A NAME="207"></A>it
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR><B>it should not be.            should be.</B>
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>Now the propositions 'it is impossible that it should be' and 'it 
<A NAME="210"></A>is not impossible that it should be' are consequent upon the propositions 
<A NAME="211"></A>'it may be', 'it is contingent', and 'it cannot be',  'it is not contingent', 
<A NAME="212"></A>the contradictories upon the contradictories. But there is inversion. The 
<A NAME="213"></A>negative of the proposition 'it is impossible' is consequent upon the proposition 
<A NAME="214"></A>'it may be' and the corresponding positive in the first case upon the negative 
<A NAME="215"></A>in the second. For 'it is impossible' is a positive proposition and 'it 
<A NAME="216"></A>is not impossible' is negative.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>We must investigate the relation subsisting between these propositions 
<A NAME="218"></A>and those which predicate necessity. That there is a distinction is clear. 
<A NAME="219"></A>In this case, contrary propositions follow respectively from contradictory 
<A NAME="220"></A>propositions, and the contradictory propositions belong to separate sequences. 
<A NAME="221"></A>For the proposition 'it is not necessary that it should be' is not the 
<A NAME="222"></A>negative of 'it is necessary that it should not be', for both these propositions 
<A NAME="223"></A>may be true of the same subject; for when it is necessary that a thing 
<A NAME="224"></A>should not be, it is not necessary that it should be. The reason why the 
<A NAME="225"></A>propositions predicating necessity do not follow in the same kind of sequence 
<A NAME="226"></A>as the rest, lies in the fact that the proposition 'it is impossible' is 
<A NAME="227"></A>equivalent, when used with a contrary subject, to the proposition 'it is 
<A NAME="228"></A>necessary'. For when it is impossible that a thing should be, it is necessary, 
<A NAME="229"></A>not that it should be, but that it should not be, and when it is impossible 
<A NAME="230"></A>that a thing should not be, it is necessary that it should be. Thus, if 
<A NAME="231"></A>the propositions predicating impossibility or non-impossibility follow 
<A NAME="232"></A>without change of subject from those predicating possibility or non-possibility, 
<A NAME="233"></A>those predicating necessity must follow with the contrary subject; for 
<A NAME="234"></A>the propositions 'it is impossible' and 'it is necessary' are not equivalent, 
<A NAME="235"></A>but, as has been said, inversely connected.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR><BR>Yet perhaps it is impossible that the contradictory propositions 
<A NAME="237"></A>predicating necessity should be thus arranged. For when it is necessary 
<A NAME="238"></A>that a thing should be, it is possible that it should be. (For if not, 
<A NAME="239"></A>the opposite follows, since one or the other must follow; so, if it is 
<A NAME="240"></A>not possible, it is impossible, and it is thus impossible that a thing 
<A NAME="241"></A>should be, which must necessarily be; which is absurd.)
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>Yet from the proposition 'it may be' it follows that it is not 
<A NAME="243"></A>impossible, and from that it follows that it is not necessary; it comes 
<A NAME="244"></A>about therefore that the thing which must necessarily be need not be; which 
<A NAME="245"></A>is absurd. But again, the proposition 'it is necessary that it should be' 
<A NAME="246"></A>does not follow from the proposition 'it may be', nor does the proposition 
<A NAME="247"></A>'it is necessary that it should not be'. For the proposition 'it may be' 
<A NAME="248"></A>implies a twofold possibility, while, if either of the two former propositions 
<A NAME="249"></A>is true, the twofold possibility vanishes. For if a thing may be, it may 
<A NAME="250"></A>also not be, but if it is necessary that it should be or that it should 
<A NAME="251"></A>not be, one of the two alternatives will be excluded. It remains, therefore, 
<A NAME="252"></A>that the proposition 'it is not necessary that it should not be' follows 
<A NAME="253"></A>from the proposition 'it may be'. For this is true also of that which must 
<A NAME="254"></A>necessarily be.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>Moreover the proposition 'it is not necessary that it should not 
<A NAME="256"></A>be' is the contradictory of that which follows from the proposition 'it 
<A NAME="257"></A>cannot be'; for 'it cannot be' is followed by 'it is impossible that it 
<A NAME="258"></A>should be' and by 'it is necessary that it should not be', and the contradictory 
<A NAME="259"></A>of this is the proposition 'it is not necessary that it should not be'. 
<A NAME="260"></A>Thus in this case also contradictory propositions follow contradictory 
<A NAME="261"></A>in the way indicated, and no logical impossibilities occur when they are 
<A NAME="262"></A>thus arranged.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>It may be questioned whether the proposition 'it may be' follows 
<A NAME="264"></A>from the proposition 'it is necessary that it should be'. If not, the contradictory 
<A NAME="265"></A>must follow, namely that it cannot be, or, if a man should maintain that 
<A NAME="266"></A>this is not the contradictory, then the proposition 'it may not 
<A NAME="267"></A>be'.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>Now both of these are false of that which necessarily is. At the 
<A NAME="269"></A>same time, it is thought that if a thing may be cut it may also not be 
<A NAME="270"></A>cut, if a thing may be it may also not be, and thus it would follow that 
<A NAME="271"></A>a thing which must necessarily be may possibly not be; which is false. 
<A NAME="272"></A>It is evident, then, that it is not always the case that that which may 
<A NAME="273"></A>be or may walk possesses also a potentiality in the other direction. There 
<A NAME="274"></A>are exceptions. In the first place we must except those things which possess 
<A NAME="275"></A>a potentiality not in accordance with a rational principle, as fire possesses 
<A NAME="276"></A>the potentiality of giving out heat, that is, an irrational capacity. Those 
<A NAME="277"></A>potentialities which involve a rational principle are potentialities of 
<A NAME="278"></A>more than one result, that is, of contrary results; those that are irrational 
<A NAME="279"></A>are not always thus constituted. As I have said, fire cannot both heat 
<A NAME="280"></A>and not heat, neither has anything that is always actual any twofold potentiality. 
<A NAME="281"></A>Yet some even of those potentialities which are irrational admit of opposite 
<A NAME="282"></A>results. However, thus much has been said to emphasize the truth that it 
<A NAME="283"></A>is not every potentiality which admits of opposite results, even where 
<A NAME="284"></A>the word is used always in the same sense.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>But in some cases the word is used equivocally. For the term 'possible' 
<A NAME="286"></A>is ambiguous, being used in the one case with reference to facts, to that 
<A NAME="287"></A>which is actualized, as when a man is said to find walking possible because 
<A NAME="288"></A>he is actually walking, and generally when a capacity is predicated because 
<A NAME="289"></A>it is actually realized; in the other case, with reference to a state in 
<A NAME="290"></A>which realization is conditionally practicable, as when a man is said to 
<A NAME="291"></A>find walking possible because under certain conditions he would walk. This 
<A NAME="292"></A>last sort of potentiality belongs only to that which can be in motion, 
<A NAME="293"></A>the former can exist also in the case of that which has not this power. 
<A NAME="294"></A>Both of that which is walking and is actual, and of that which has the 
<A NAME="295"></A>capacity though not necessarily realized, it is true to say that it is 
<A NAME="296"></A>not impossible that it should walk (or, in the other case, that it should 
<A NAME="297"></A>be), but while we cannot predicate this latter kind of potentiality of 
<A NAME="298"></A>that which is necessary in the unqualified sense of the word, we can predicate 
<A NAME="299"></A>the former.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>Our conclusion, then, is this: that since the universal is consequent 
<A NAME="301"></A>upon the particular, that which is necessary is also possible, though not 
<A NAME="302"></A>in every sense in which the word may be used.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>We may perhaps state that necessity and its absence are the initial 
<A NAME="304"></A>principles of existence and non-existence, and that all else must be regarded 
<A NAME="305"></A>as posterior to these.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>It is plain from what has been said that that which is of necessity 
<A NAME="307"></A>is actual. Thus, if that which is eternal is prior, actuality also is prior 
<A NAME="308"></A>to potentiality. Some things are actualities without potentiality, namely, 
<A NAME="309"></A>the primary substances; a second class consists of those things which are 
<A NAME="310"></A>actual but also potential, whose actuality is in nature prior to their 
<A NAME="311"></A>potentiality, though posterior in time; a third class comprises those things 
<A NAME="312"></A>which are never actualized, but are pure potentialities.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="313"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>The question arises whether an affirmation finds its contrary in 
<A NAME="315"></A>a denial or in another affirmation; whether the proposition 'every man 
<A NAME="316"></A>is just' finds its contrary in the proposition 'no man is just', or in 
<A NAME="317"></A>the proposition 'every man is unjust'. Take the propositions 'Callias is 
<A NAME="318"></A>just', 'Callias is not just', 'Callias is unjust'; we have to discover 
<A NAME="319"></A>which of these form contraries.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>Now if the spoken word corresponds with the judgement of the mind, 
<A NAME="321"></A>and if, in thought, that judgement is the contrary of another, which pronounces 
<A NAME="322"></A>a contrary fact, in the way, for instance, in which the judgement 'every 
<A NAME="323"></A>man is just' pronounces a contrary to that pronounced by the judgement 
<A NAME="324"></A>'every man is unjust', the same must needs hold good with regard to spoken 
<A NAME="325"></A>affirmations.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>But if, in thought, it is not the judgement which pronounces a 
<A NAME="327"></A>contrary fact that is the contrary of another, then one affirmation will 
<A NAME="328"></A>not find its contrary in another, but rather in the corresponding denial. 
<A NAME="329"></A>We must therefore consider which true judgement is the contrary of the 
<A NAME="330"></A>false, that which forms the denial of the false judgement or that which 
<A NAME="331"></A>affirms the contrary fact.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>Let me illustrate. There is a true judgement concerning that which 
<A NAME="333"></A>is good, that it is good; another, a false judgement, that it is not good; 
<A NAME="334"></A>and a third, which is distinct, that it is bad. Which of these two is contrary 
<A NAME="335"></A>to the true? And if they are one and the same, which mode of expression 
<A NAME="336"></A>forms the contrary?
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>It is an error to suppose that judgements are to be defined as 
<A NAME="338"></A>contrary in virtue of the fact that they have contrary subjects; for the 
<A NAME="339"></A>judgement concerning a good thing, that it is good, and that concerning 
<A NAME="340"></A>a bad thing, that it is bad, may be one and the same, and whether they 
<A NAME="341"></A>are so or not, they both represent the truth. Yet the subjects here are 
<A NAME="342"></A>contrary. But judgements are not contrary because they have contrary subjects, 
<A NAME="343"></A>but because they are to the contrary effect.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>Now if we take the judgement that that which is good is good, and 
<A NAME="345"></A>another that it is not good, and if there are at the same time other attributes, 
<A NAME="346"></A>which do not and cannot belong to the good, we must nevertheless refuse 
<A NAME="347"></A>to treat as the contraries of the true judgement those which opine that 
<A NAME="348"></A>some other attribute subsists which does not subsist, as also those that 
<A NAME="349"></A>opine that some other attribute does not subsist which does subsist, for 
<A NAME="350"></A>both these classes of judgement are of unlimited content.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>Those judgements must rather be termed contrary to the true judgements, 
<A NAME="352"></A>in which error is present. Now these judgements are those which are concerned 
<A NAME="353"></A>with the starting points of generation, and generation is the passing from 
<A NAME="354"></A>one extreme to its opposite; therefore error is a like 
<A NAME="355"></A>transition.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>Now that which is good is both good and not bad. The first quality 
<A NAME="357"></A>is part of its essence, the second accidental; for it is by accident that 
<A NAME="358"></A>it is not bad. But if that true judgement is most really true, which concerns 
<A NAME="359"></A>the subject's intrinsic nature, then that false judgement likewise is most 
<A NAME="360"></A>really false, which concerns its intrinsic nature. Now the judgement that 
<A NAME="361"></A>that is good is not good is a false judgement concerning its intrinsic 
<A NAME="362"></A>nature, the judgement that it is bad is one concerning that which is accidental. 
<A NAME="363"></A>Thus the judgement which denies the true judgement is more really false 
<A NAME="364"></A>than that which positively asserts the presence of the contrary quality. 
<A NAME="365"></A>But it is the man who forms that judgement which is contrary to the true 
<A NAME="366"></A>who is most thoroughly deceived, for contraries are among the things which 
<A NAME="367"></A>differ most widely within the same class. If then of the two judgements 
<A NAME="368"></A>one is contrary to the true judgement, but that which is contradictory 
<A NAME="369"></A>is the more truly contrary, then the latter, it seems, is the real contrary. 
<A NAME="370"></A>The judgement that that which is good is bad is composite. For presumably 
<A NAME="371"></A>the man who forms that judgement must at the same time understand that 
<A NAME="372"></A>that which is good is not good.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>Further, the contradictory is either always the contrary or never; 
<A NAME="374"></A>therefore, if it must necessarily be so in all other cases, our conclusion 
<A NAME="375"></A>in the case just dealt with would seem to be correct. Now where terms have 
<A NAME="376"></A>no contrary, that judgement is false, which forms the negative of the true; 
<A NAME="377"></A>for instance, he who thinks a man is not a man forms a false judgement. 
<A NAME="378"></A>If then in these cases the negative is the contrary, then the principle 
<A NAME="379"></A>is universal in its application.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>Again, the judgement that that which is not good is not good is 
<A NAME="381"></A>parallel with the judgement that that which is good is good. Besides these 
<A NAME="382"></A>there is the judgement that that which is good is not good, parallel with 
<A NAME="383"></A>the judgement that that that is not good is good. Let us consider, therefore, 
<A NAME="384"></A>what would form the contrary of the true judgement that that which is not 
<A NAME="385"></A>good is not good. The judgement that it is bad would, of course, fail to 
<A NAME="386"></A>meet the case, since two true judgements are never contrary and this judgement 
<A NAME="387"></A>might be true at the same time as that with which it is connected. For 
<A NAME="388"></A>since some things which are not good are bad, both judgements may be true. 
<A NAME="389"></A>Nor is the judgement that it is not bad the contrary, for this too might 
<A NAME="390"></A>be true, since both qualities might be predicated of the same subject. 
<A NAME="391"></A>It remains, therefore, that of the judgement concerning that which is not 
<A NAME="392"></A>good, that it is not good, the contrary judgement is that it is good; for 
<A NAME="393"></A>this is false. In the same way, moreover, the judgement concerning that 
<A NAME="394"></A>which is good, that it is not good, is the contrary of the judgement that 
<A NAME="395"></A>it is good.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>It is evident that it will make no difference if we universalize 
<A NAME="397"></A>the positive judgement, for the universal negative judgement will form 
<A NAME="398"></A>the contrary. For instance, the contrary of the judgement that everything 
<A NAME="399"></A>that is good is good is that nothing that is good is good. For the judgement 
<A NAME="400"></A>that that which is good is good, if the subject be understood in a universal 
<A NAME="401"></A>sense, is equivalent to the judgement that whatever is good is good, and 
<A NAME="402"></A>this is identical with the judgement that everything that is good is good. 
<A NAME="403"></A>We may deal similarly with judgements concerning that which is not 
<A NAME="404"></A>good.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>If therefore this is the rule with judgements, and if spoken affirmations 
<A NAME="406"></A>and denials are judgements expressed in words, it is plain that the universal 
<A NAME="407"></A>denial is the contrary of the affirmation about the same subject. Thus 
<A NAME="408"></A>the propositions 'everything good is good', 'every man is good', have for 
<A NAME="409"></A>their contraries the propositions 'nothing good is good', 'no man is good'. 
<A NAME="410"></A>The contradictory propositions, on the other hand, are 'not everything 
<A NAME="411"></A>good is good', 'not every man is good'.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>It is evident, also, that neither true judgements nor true propositions 
<A NAME="413"></A>can be contrary the one to the other. For whereas, when two propositions 
<A NAME="414"></A>are true, a man may state both at the same time without inconsistency, 
<A NAME="415"></A>contrary propositions are those which state contrary conditions, and contrary 
<A NAME="416"></A>conditions cannot subsist at one and the same time in the same 
<A NAME="417"></A>subject.
