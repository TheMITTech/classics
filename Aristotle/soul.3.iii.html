<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>That there is no sixth sense in addition to the five enumerated-sight, 
<A NAME="12"></A>hearing, smell, taste, touch-may be established by the following 
<A NAME="13"></A>considerations:
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>If we have actually sensation of everything of which touch can 
<A NAME="15"></A>give us sensation (for all the qualities of the tangible qua tangible are 
<A NAME="16"></A>perceived by us through touch); and if absence of a sense necessarily involves 
<A NAME="17"></A>absence of a sense-organ; and if (1) all objects that we perceive by immediate 
<A NAME="18"></A>contact with them are perceptible by touch, which sense we actually possess, 
<A NAME="19"></A>and (2) all objects that we perceive through media, i.e. without immediate 
<A NAME="20"></A>contact, are perceptible by or through the simple elements, e.g. air and 
<A NAME="21"></A>water (and this is so arranged that (a) if more than one kind of sensible 
<A NAME="22"></A>object is perceivable through a single medium, the possessor of a sense-organ 
<A NAME="23"></A>homogeneous with that medium has the power of perceiving both kinds of 
<A NAME="24"></A>objects; for example, if the sense-organ is made of air, and air is a medium 
<A NAME="25"></A>both for sound and for colour; and that (b) if more than one medium can 
<A NAME="26"></A>transmit the same kind of sensible objects, as e.g. water as well as air 
<A NAME="27"></A>can transmit colour, both being transparent, then the possessor of either 
<A NAME="28"></A>alone will be able to perceive the kind of objects transmissible through 
<A NAME="29"></A>both); and if of the simple elements two only, air and water, go to form 
<A NAME="30"></A>sense-organs (for the pupil is made of water, the organ of hearing is made 
<A NAME="31"></A>of air, and the organ of smell of one or other of these two, while fire 
<A NAME="32"></A>is found either in none or in all-warmth being an essential condition of 
<A NAME="33"></A>all sensibility-and earth either in none or, if anywhere, specially mingled 
<A NAME="34"></A>with the components of the organ of touch; wherefore it would remain that 
<A NAME="35"></A>there can be no sense-organ formed of anything except water and air); and 
<A NAME="36"></A>if these sense-organs are actually found in certain animals;-then all the 
<A NAME="37"></A>possible senses are possessed by those animals that are not imperfect or 
<A NAME="38"></A>mutilated (for even the mole is observed to have eyes beneath its skin); 
<A NAME="39"></A>so that, if there is no fifth element and no property other than those 
<A NAME="40"></A>which belong to the four elements of our world, no sense can be wanting 
<A NAME="41"></A>to such animals.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>Further, there cannot be a special sense-organ for the common sensibles 
<A NAME="43"></A>either, i.e. the objects which we perceive incidentally through this or 
<A NAME="44"></A>that special sense, e.g. movement, rest, figure, magnitude, number, unity; 
<A NAME="45"></A>for all these we perceive by movement, e.g. magnitude by movement, and 
<A NAME="46"></A>therefore also figure (for figure is a species of magnitude), what is at 
<A NAME="47"></A>rest by the absence of movement: number is perceived by the negation of 
<A NAME="48"></A>continuity, and by the special sensibles; for each sense perceives one 
<A NAME="49"></A>class of sensible objects. So that it is clearly impossible that there 
<A NAME="50"></A>should be a special sense for any one of the common sensibles, e.g. movement; 
<A NAME="51"></A>for, if that were so, our perception of it would be exactly parallel to 
<A NAME="52"></A>our present perception of what is sweet by vision. That is so because we 
<A NAME="53"></A>have a sense for each of the two qualities, in virtue of which when they 
<A NAME="54"></A>happen to meet in one sensible object we are aware of both contemporaneously. 
<A NAME="55"></A>If it were not like this our perception of the common qualities would always 
<A NAME="56"></A>be incidental, i.e. as is the perception of Cleon's son, where we perceive 
<A NAME="57"></A>him not as Cleon's son but as white, and the white thing which we really 
<A NAME="58"></A>perceive happens to be Cleon's son.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>But in the case of the common sensibles there is already in us 
<A NAME="60"></A>a general sensibility which enables us to perceive them directly; there 
<A NAME="61"></A>is therefore no special sense required for their perception: if there were, 
<A NAME="62"></A>our perception of them would have been exactly like what has been above 
<A NAME="63"></A>described.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>The senses perceive each other's special objects incidentally; 
<A NAME="65"></A>not because the percipient sense is this or that special sense, but because 
<A NAME="66"></A>all form a unity: this incidental perception takes place whenever sense 
<A NAME="67"></A>is directed at one and the same moment to two disparate qualities in one 
<A NAME="68"></A>and the same object, e.g. to the bitterness and the yellowness of bile, 
<A NAME="69"></A>the assertion of the identity of both cannot be the act of either of the 
<A NAME="70"></A>senses; hence the illusion of sense, e.g. the belief that if a thing is 
<A NAME="71"></A>yellow it is bile.
<A NAME="72"></A><BR><BR>It might be asked why we have more senses than one. Is it to prevent 
<A NAME="73"></A>a failure to apprehend the common sensibles, e.g. movement, magnitude, 
<A NAME="74"></A>and number, which go along with the special sensibles? Had we no sense 
<A NAME="75"></A>but sight, and that sense no object but white, they would have tended to 
<A NAME="76"></A>escape our notice and everything would have merged for us into an indistinguishable 
<A NAME="77"></A>identity because of the concomitance of colour and magnitude. As it is, 
<A NAME="78"></A>the fact that the common sensibles are given in the objects of more than 
<A NAME="79"></A>one sense reveals their distinction from each and all of the special 
<A NAME="80"></A>sensibles.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="81"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>Since it is through sense that we are aware that we are seeing 
<A NAME="83"></A>or hearing, it must be either by sight that we are aware of seeing, or 
<A NAME="84"></A>by some sense other than sight. But the sense that gives us this new sensation 
<A NAME="85"></A>must perceive both sight and its object, viz. colour: so that either (1) 
<A NAME="86"></A>there will be two senses both percipient of the same sensible object, or 
<A NAME="87"></A>(2) the sense must be percipient of itself. Further, even if the sense 
<A NAME="88"></A>which perceives sight were different from sight, we must either fall into 
<A NAME="89"></A>an infinite regress, or we must somewhere assume a sense which is aware 
<A NAME="90"></A>of itself. If so, we ought to do this in the first case.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>This presents a difficulty: if to perceive by sight is just to 
<A NAME="92"></A>see, and what is seen is colour (or the coloured), then if we are to see 
<A NAME="93"></A>that which sees, that which sees originally must be coloured. It is clear 
<A NAME="94"></A>therefore that 'to perceive by sight' has more than one meaning; for even 
<A NAME="95"></A>when we are not seeing, it is by sight that we discriminate darkness from 
<A NAME="96"></A>light, though not in the same way as we distinguish one colour from another. 
<A NAME="97"></A>Further, in a sense even that which sees is coloured; for in each case 
<A NAME="98"></A>the sense-organ is capable of receiving the sensible object without its 
<A NAME="99"></A>matter. That is why even when the sensible objects are gone the sensings 
<A NAME="100"></A>and imaginings continue to exist in the sense-organs.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>The activity of the sensible object and that of the percipient 
<A NAME="102"></A>sense is one and the same activity, and yet the distinction between their 
<A NAME="103"></A>being remains. Take as illustration actual sound and actual hearing: a 
<A NAME="104"></A>man may have hearing and yet not be hearing, and that which has a sound 
<A NAME="105"></A>is not always sounding. But when that which can hear is actively hearing 
<A NAME="106"></A>and which can sound is sounding, then the actual hearing and the actual 
<A NAME="107"></A>sound are merged in one (these one might call respectively hearkening and 
<A NAME="108"></A>sounding).
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>If it is true that the movement, both the acting and the being 
<A NAME="110"></A>acted upon, is to be found in that which is acted upon, both the sound 
<A NAME="111"></A>and the hearing so far as it is actual must be found in that which has 
<A NAME="112"></A>the faculty of hearing; for it is in the passive factor that the actuality 
<A NAME="113"></A>of the active or motive factor is realized; that is why that which causes 
<A NAME="114"></A>movement may be at rest. Now the actuality of that which can sound is just 
<A NAME="115"></A>sound or sounding, and the actuality of that which can hear is hearing 
<A NAME="116"></A>or hearkening; 'sound' and 'hearing' are both ambiguous. The same account 
<A NAME="117"></A>applies to the other senses and their objects. For as the-acting-and-being-acted-upon 
<A NAME="118"></A>is to be found in the passive, not in the active factor, so also the actuality 
<A NAME="119"></A>of the sensible object and that of the sensitive subject are both realized 
<A NAME="120"></A>in the latter. But while in some cases each aspect of the total actuality 
<A NAME="121"></A>has a distinct name, e.g. sounding and hearkening, in some one or other 
<A NAME="122"></A>is nameless, e.g. the actuality of sight is called seeing, but the actuality 
<A NAME="123"></A>of colour has no name: the actuality of the faculty of taste is called 
<A NAME="124"></A>tasting, but the actuality of flavour has no name. Since the actualities 
<A NAME="125"></A>of the sensible object and of the sensitive faculty are one actuality in 
<A NAME="126"></A>spite of the difference between their modes of being, actual hearing and 
<A NAME="127"></A>actual sounding appear and disappear from existence at one and the same 
<A NAME="128"></A>moment, and so actual savour and actual tasting, &c., while as potentialities 
<A NAME="129"></A>one of them may exist without the other. The earlier students of nature 
<A NAME="130"></A>were mistaken in their view that without sight there was no white or black, 
<A NAME="131"></A>without taste no savour. This statement of theirs is partly true, partly 
<A NAME="132"></A>false: 'sense' and 'the sensible object' are ambiguous terms, i.e. may 
<A NAME="133"></A>denote either potentialities or actualities: the statement is true of the 
<A NAME="134"></A>latter, false of the former. This ambiguity they wholly failed to 
<A NAME="135"></A>notice.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>If voice always implies a concord, and if the voice and the hearing 
<A NAME="137"></A>of it are in one sense one and the same, and if concord always implies 
<A NAME="138"></A>a ratio, hearing as well as what is heard must be a ratio. That is why 
<A NAME="139"></A>the excess of either the sharp or the flat destroys the hearing. (So also 
<A NAME="140"></A>in the case of savours excess destroys the sense of taste, and in the case 
<A NAME="141"></A>of colours excessive brightness or darkness destroys the sight, and in 
<A NAME="142"></A>the case of smell excess of strength whether in the direction of sweetness 
<A NAME="143"></A>or bitterness is destructive.) This shows that the sense is a 
<A NAME="144"></A>ratio.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>That is also why the objects of sense are (1) pleasant when the 
<A NAME="146"></A>sensible extremes such as acid or sweet or salt being pure and unmixed 
<A NAME="147"></A>are brought into the proper ratio; then they are pleasant: and in general 
<A NAME="148"></A>what is blended is more pleasant than the sharp or the flat alone; or, 
<A NAME="149"></A>to touch, that which is capable of being either warmed or chilled: the 
<A NAME="150"></A>sense and the ratio are identical: while (2) in excess the sensible extremes 
<A NAME="151"></A>are painful or destructive.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>Each sense then is relative to its particular group of sensible 
<A NAME="153"></A>qualities: it is found in a sense-organ as such and discriminates the differences 
<A NAME="154"></A>which exist within that group; e.g. sight discriminates white and black, 
<A NAME="155"></A>taste sweet and bitter, and so in all cases. Since we also discriminate 
<A NAME="156"></A>white from sweet, and indeed each sensible quality from every other, with 
<A NAME="157"></A>what do we perceive that they are different? It must be by sense; for what 
<A NAME="158"></A>is before us is sensible objects. (Hence it is also obvious that the flesh 
<A NAME="159"></A>cannot be the ultimate sense-organ: if it were, the discriminating power 
<A NAME="160"></A>could not do its work without immediate contact with the 
<A NAME="161"></A>object.)
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>Therefore (1) discrimination between white and sweet cannot be 
<A NAME="163"></A>effected by two agencies which remain separate; both the qualities discriminated 
<A NAME="164"></A>must be present to something that is one and single. On any other supposition 
<A NAME="165"></A>even if I perceived sweet and you perceived white, the difference between 
<A NAME="166"></A>them would be apparent. What says that two things are different must be 
<A NAME="167"></A>one; for sweet is different from white. Therefore what asserts this difference 
<A NAME="168"></A>must be self-identical, and as what asserts, so also what thinks or perceives. 
<A NAME="169"></A>That it is not possible by means of two agencies which remain separate 
<A NAME="170"></A>to discriminate two objects which are separate, is therefore obvious; and 
<A NAME="171"></A>that (it is not possible to do this in separate movements of time may be 
<A NAME="172"></A>seen' if we look at it as follows. For as what asserts the difference between 
<A NAME="173"></A>the good and the bad is one and the same, so also the time at which it 
<A NAME="174"></A>asserts the one to be different and the other to be different is not accidental 
<A NAME="175"></A>to the assertion (as it is for instance when I now assert a difference 
<A NAME="176"></A>but do not assert that there is now a difference); it asserts thus-both 
<A NAME="177"></A>now and that the objects are different now; the objects therefore must 
<A NAME="178"></A>be present at one and the same moment. Both the discriminating power and 
<A NAME="179"></A>the time of its exercise must be one and undivided.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>But, it may be objected, it is impossible that what is self-identical 
<A NAME="181"></A>should be moved at me and the same time with contrary movements in so far 
<A NAME="182"></A>as it is undivided, and in an undivided moment of time. For if what is 
<A NAME="183"></A>sweet be the quality perceived, it moves the sense or thought in this determinate 
<A NAME="184"></A>way, while what is bitter moves it in a contrary way, and what is white 
<A NAME="185"></A>in a different way. Is it the case then that what discriminates, though 
<A NAME="186"></A>both numerically one and indivisible, is at the same time divided in its 
<A NAME="187"></A>being? In one sense, it is what is divided that perceives two separate 
<A NAME="188"></A>objects at once, but in another sense it does so qua undivided; for it 
<A NAME="189"></A>is divisible in its being but spatially and numerically undivided. is not 
<A NAME="190"></A>this impossible? For while it is true that what is self-identical and undivided 
<A NAME="191"></A>may be both contraries at once potentially, it cannot be self-identical 
<A NAME="192"></A>in its being-it must lose its unity by being put into activity. It is not 
<A NAME="193"></A>possible to be at once white and black, and therefore it must also be impossible 
<A NAME="194"></A>for a thing to be affected at one and the same moment by the forms of both, 
<A NAME="195"></A>assuming it to be the case that sensation and thinking are properly so 
<A NAME="196"></A>described.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>The answer is that just as what is called a 'point' is, as being 
<A NAME="198"></A>at once one and two, properly said to be divisible, so here, that which 
<A NAME="199"></A>discriminates is qua undivided one, and active in a single moment of time, 
<A NAME="200"></A>while so far forth as it is divisible it twice over uses the same dot at 
<A NAME="201"></A>one and the same time. So far forth then as it takes the limit as two' 
<A NAME="202"></A>it discriminates two separate objects with what in a sense is divided: 
<A NAME="203"></A>while so far as it takes it as one, it does so with what is one and occupies 
<A NAME="204"></A>in its activity a single moment of time.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>About the principle in virtue of which we say that animals are 
<A NAME="206"></A>percipient, let this discussion suffice.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="207"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>There are two distinctive peculiarities by reference to which we 
<A NAME="209"></A>characterize the soul (1) local movement and (2) thinking, discriminating, 
<A NAME="210"></A>and perceiving. Thinking both speculative and practical is regarded as 
<A NAME="211"></A>akin to a form of perceiving; for in the one as well as the other the soul 
<A NAME="212"></A>discriminates and is cognizant of something which is. Indeed the ancients 
<A NAME="213"></A>go so far as to identify thinking and perceiving; e.g. Empedocles says 
<A NAME="214"></A>'For 'tis in respect of what is present that man's wit is increased', and 
<A NAME="215"></A>again 'Whence it befalls them from time to time to think diverse thoughts', 
<A NAME="216"></A>and Homer's phrase 'For suchlike is man's mind' means the same. They all 
<A NAME="217"></A>look upon thinking as a bodily process like perceiving, and hold that like 
<A NAME="218"></A>is known as well as perceived by like, as I explained at the beginning 
<A NAME="219"></A>of our discussion. Yet they ought at the same time to have accounted for 
<A NAME="220"></A>error also; for it is more intimately connected with animal existence and 
<A NAME="221"></A>the soul continues longer in the state of error than in that of truth. 
<A NAME="222"></A>They cannot escape the dilemma: either (1) whatever seems is true (and 
<A NAME="223"></A>there are some who accept this) or (2) error is contact with the unlike; 
<A NAME="224"></A>for that is the opposite of the knowing of like by like.
<A NAME="225"></A><BR><BR>But it is a received principle that error as well as knowledge 
<A NAME="226"></A>in respect to contraries is one and the same.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>That perceiving and practical thinking are not identical is therefore 
<A NAME="228"></A>obvious; for the former is universal in the animal world, the latter is 
<A NAME="229"></A>found in only a small division of it. Further, speculative thinking is 
<A NAME="230"></A>also distinct from perceiving-I mean that in which we find rightness and 
<A NAME="231"></A>wrongness-rightness in prudence, knowledge, true opinion, wrongness in 
<A NAME="232"></A>their opposites; for perception of the special objects of sense is always 
<A NAME="233"></A>free from error, and is found in all animals, while it is possible to think 
<A NAME="234"></A>falsely as well as truly, and thought is found only where there is discourse 
<A NAME="235"></A>of reason as well as sensibility. For imagination is different from either 
<A NAME="236"></A>perceiving or discursive thinking, though it is not found without sensation, 
<A NAME="237"></A>or judgement without it. That this activity is not the same kind of thinking 
<A NAME="238"></A>as judgement is obvious. For imagining lies within our own power whenever 
<A NAME="239"></A>we wish (e.g. we can call up a picture, as in the practice of mnemonics 
<A NAME="240"></A>by the use of mental images), but in forming opinions we are not free: 
<A NAME="241"></A>we cannot escape the alternative of falsehood or truth. Further, when we 
<A NAME="242"></A>think something to be fearful or threatening, emotion is immediately produced, 
<A NAME="243"></A>and so too with what is encouraging; but when we merely imagine we remain 
<A NAME="244"></A>as unaffected as persons who are looking at a painting of some dreadful 
<A NAME="245"></A>or encouraging scene. Again within the field of judgement itself we find 
<A NAME="246"></A>varieties, knowledge, opinion, prudence, and their opposites; of the differences 
<A NAME="247"></A>between these I must speak elsewhere.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>Thinking is different from perceiving and is held to be in part 
<A NAME="249"></A>imagination, in part judgement: we must therefore first mark off the sphere 
<A NAME="250"></A>of imagination and then speak of judgement. If then imagination is that 
<A NAME="251"></A>in virtue of which an image arises for us, excluding metaphorical uses 
<A NAME="252"></A>of the term, is it a single faculty or disposition relative to images, 
<A NAME="253"></A>in virtue of which we discriminate and are either in error or not? The 
<A NAME="254"></A>faculties in virtue of which we do this are sense, opinion, science, 
<A NAME="255"></A>intelligence.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>That imagination is not sense is clear from the following considerations: 
<A NAME="257"></A>Sense is either a faculty or an activity, e.g. sight or seeing: imagination 
<A NAME="258"></A>takes place in the absence of both, as e.g. in dreams. (Again, sense is 
<A NAME="259"></A>always present, imagination not. If actual imagination and actual sensation 
<A NAME="260"></A>were the same, imagination would be found in all the brutes: this is held 
<A NAME="261"></A>not to be the case; e.g. it is not found in ants or bees or grubs. (Again, 
<A NAME="262"></A>sensations are always true, imaginations are for the most part false. (Once 
<A NAME="263"></A>more, even in ordinary speech, we do not, when sense functions precisely 
<A NAME="264"></A>with regard to its object, say that we imagine it to be a man, but rather 
<A NAME="265"></A>when there is some failure of accuracy in its exercise. And as we were 
<A NAME="266"></A>saying before, visions appear to us even when our eyes are shut. Neither 
<A NAME="267"></A>is imagination any of the things that are never in error: e.g. knowledge 
<A NAME="268"></A>or intelligence; for imagination may be false.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>It remains therefore to see if it is opinion, for opinion may be 
<A NAME="270"></A>either true or false.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>But opinion involves belief (for without belief in what we opine 
<A NAME="272"></A>we cannot have an opinion), and in the brutes though we often find imagination 
<A NAME="273"></A>we never find belief. Further, every opinion is accompanied by belief, 
<A NAME="274"></A>belief by conviction, and conviction by discourse of reason: while there 
<A NAME="275"></A>are some of the brutes in which we find imagination, without discourse 
<A NAME="276"></A>of reason. It is clear then that imagination cannot, again, be (1) opinion 
<A NAME="277"></A>plus sensation, or (2) opinion mediated by sensation, or (3) a blend of 
<A NAME="278"></A>opinion and sensation; this is impossible both for these reasons and because 
<A NAME="279"></A>the content of the supposed opinion cannot be different from that of the 
<A NAME="280"></A>sensation (I mean that imagination must be the blending of the perception 
<A NAME="281"></A>of white with the opinion that it is white: it could scarcely be a blend 
<A NAME="282"></A>of the opinion that it is good with the perception that it is white): to 
<A NAME="283"></A>imagine is therefore (on this view) identical with the thinking of exactly 
<A NAME="284"></A>the same as what one in the strictest sense perceives. But what we imagine 
<A NAME="285"></A>is sometimes false though our contemporaneous judgement about it is true; 
<A NAME="286"></A>e.g. we imagine the sun to be a foot in diameter though we are convinced 
<A NAME="287"></A>that it is larger than the inhabited part of the earth, and the following 
<A NAME="288"></A>dilemma presents itself. Either (a while the fact has not changed and the 
<A NAME="289"></A>(observer has neither forgotten nor lost belief in the true opinion which 
<A NAME="290"></A>he had, that opinion has disappeared, or (b) if he retains it then his 
<A NAME="291"></A>opinion is at once true and false. A true opinion, however, becomes false 
<A NAME="292"></A>only when the fact alters without being noticed.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>Imagination is therefore neither any one of the states enumerated, 
<A NAME="294"></A>nor compounded out of them.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>But since when one thing has been set in motion another thing may 
<A NAME="296"></A>be moved by it, and imagination is held to be a movement and to be impossible 
<A NAME="297"></A>without sensation, i.e. to occur in beings that are percipient and to have 
<A NAME="298"></A>for its content what can be perceived, and since movement may be produced 
<A NAME="299"></A>by actual sensation and that movement is necessarily similar in character 
<A NAME="300"></A>to the sensation itself, this movement must be (1) necessarily (a) incapable 
<A NAME="301"></A>of existing apart from sensation, (b) incapable of existing except when 
<A NAME="302"></A>we perceive, (such that in virtue of its possession that in which it is 
<A NAME="303"></A>found may present various phenomena both active and passive, and (such 
<A NAME="304"></A>that it may be either true or false.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>The reason of the last characteristic is as follows. Perception 
<A NAME="306"></A>(1) of the special objects of sense is never in error or admits the least 
<A NAME="307"></A>possible amount of falsehood. (2) That of the concomitance of the objects 
<A NAME="308"></A>concomitant with the sensible qualities comes next: in this case certainly 
<A NAME="309"></A>we may be deceived; for while the perception that there is white before 
<A NAME="310"></A>us cannot be false, the perception that what is white is this or that may 
<A NAME="311"></A>be false. (3) Third comes the perception of the universal attributes which 
<A NAME="312"></A>accompany the concomitant objects to which the special sensibles attach 
<A NAME="313"></A>(I mean e.g. of movement and magnitude); it is in respect of these that 
<A NAME="314"></A>the greatest amount of sense-illusion is possible.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>The motion which is due to the activity of sense in these three 
<A NAME="316"></A>modes of its exercise will differ from the activity of sense; (1) the first 
<A NAME="317"></A>kind of derived motion is free from error while the sensation is present; 
<A NAME="318"></A>(2) and (3) the others may be erroneous whether it is present or absent, 
<A NAME="319"></A>especially when the object of perception is far off. If then imagination 
<A NAME="320"></A>presents no other features than those enumerated and is what we have described, 
<A NAME="321"></A>then imagination must be a movement resulting from an actual exercise of 
<A NAME="322"></A>a power of sense.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>As sight is the most highly developed sense, the name Phantasia 
<A NAME="324"></A>(imagination) has been formed from Phaos (light) because it is not possible 
<A NAME="325"></A>to see without light.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>And because imaginations remain in the organs of sense and resemble 
<A NAME="327"></A>sensations, animals in their actions are largely guided by them, some (i.e. 
<A NAME="328"></A>the brutes) because of the non-existence in them of mind, others (i.e. 
<A NAME="329"></A>men) because of the temporary eclipse in them of mind by feeling or disease 
<A NAME="330"></A>or sleep.
<A NAME="331"></A><BR><BR>About imagination, what it is and why it exists, let so much 
<A NAME="332"></A>suffice.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="333"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>Turning now to the part of the soul with which the soul knows and 
<A NAME="335"></A>thinks (whether this is separable from the others in definition only, or 
<A NAME="336"></A>spatially as well) we have to inquire (1) what differentiates this part, 
<A NAME="337"></A>and (2) how thinking can take place.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>If thinking is like perceiving, it must be either a process in 
<A NAME="339"></A>which the soul is acted upon by what is capable of being thought, or a 
<A NAME="340"></A>process different from but analogous to that. The thinking part of the 
<A NAME="341"></A>soul must therefore be, while impassible, capable of receiving the form 
<A NAME="342"></A>of an object; that is, must be potentially identical in character with 
<A NAME="343"></A>its object without being the object. Mind must be related to what is thinkable, 
<A NAME="344"></A>as sense is to what is sensible.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>Therefore, since everything is a possible object of thought, mind 
<A NAME="346"></A>in order, as Anaxagoras says, to dominate, that is, to know, must be pure 
<A NAME="347"></A>from all admixture; for the co-presence of what is alien to its nature 
<A NAME="348"></A>is a hindrance and a block: it follows that it too, like the sensitive 
<A NAME="349"></A>part, can have no nature of its own, other than that of having a certain 
<A NAME="350"></A>capacity. Thus that in the soul which is called mind (by mind I mean that 
<A NAME="351"></A>whereby the soul thinks and judges) is, before it thinks, not actually 
<A NAME="352"></A>any real thing. For this reason it cannot reasonably be regarded as blended 
<A NAME="353"></A>with the body: if so, it would acquire some quality, e.g. warmth or cold, 
<A NAME="354"></A>or even have an organ like the sensitive faculty: as it is, it has none. 
<A NAME="355"></A>It was a good idea to call the soul 'the place of forms', though (1) this 
<A NAME="356"></A>description holds only of the intellective soul, and (2) even this is the 
<A NAME="357"></A>forms only potentially, not actually.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>Observation of the sense-organs and their employment reveals a 
<A NAME="359"></A>distinction between the impassibility of the sensitive and that of the 
<A NAME="360"></A>intellective faculty. After strong stimulation of a sense we are less able 
<A NAME="361"></A>to exercise it than before, as e.g. in the case of a loud sound we cannot 
<A NAME="362"></A>hear easily immediately after, or in the case of a bright colour or a powerful 
<A NAME="363"></A>odour we cannot see or smell, but in the case of mind thought about an 
<A NAME="364"></A>object that is highly intelligible renders it more and not less able afterwards 
<A NAME="365"></A>to think objects that are less intelligible: the reason is that while the 
<A NAME="366"></A>faculty of sensation is dependent upon the body, mind is separable from 
<A NAME="367"></A>it.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>Once the mind has become each set of its possible objects, as a 
<A NAME="369"></A>man of science has, when this phrase is used of one who is actually a man 
<A NAME="370"></A>of science (this happens when he is now able to exercise the power on his 
<A NAME="371"></A>own initiative), its condition is still one of potentiality, but in a different 
<A NAME="372"></A>sense from the potentiality which preceded the acquisition of knowledge 
<A NAME="373"></A>by learning or discovery: the mind too is then able to think 
<A NAME="374"></A>itself.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>Since we can distinguish between a spatial magnitude and what it 
<A NAME="376"></A>is to be such, and between water and what it is to be water, and so in 
<A NAME="377"></A>many other cases (though not in all; for in certain cases the thing and 
<A NAME="378"></A>its form are identical), flesh and what it is to be flesh are discriminated 
<A NAME="379"></A>either by different faculties, or by the same faculty in two different 
<A NAME="380"></A>states: for flesh necessarily involves matter and is like what is snub-nosed, 
<A NAME="381"></A>a this in a this. Now it is by means of the sensitive faculty that we discriminate 
<A NAME="382"></A>the hot and the cold, i.e. the factors which combined in a certain ratio 
<A NAME="383"></A>constitute flesh: the essential character of flesh is apprehended by something 
<A NAME="384"></A>different either wholly separate from the sensitive faculty or related 
<A NAME="385"></A>to it as a bent line to the same line when it has been straightened 
<A NAME="386"></A>out.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>Again in the case of abstract objects what is straight is analogous 
<A NAME="388"></A>to what is snub-nosed; for it necessarily implies a continuum as its matter: 
<A NAME="389"></A>its constitutive essence is different, if we may distinguish between straightness 
<A NAME="390"></A>and what is straight: let us take it to be two-ness. It must be apprehended, 
<A NAME="391"></A>therefore, by a different power or by the same power in a different state. 
<A NAME="392"></A>To sum up, in so far as the realities it knows are capable of being separated 
<A NAME="393"></A>from their matter, so it is also with the powers of 
<A NAME="394"></A>mind.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>The problem might be suggested: if thinking is a passive affection, 
<A NAME="396"></A>then if mind is simple and impassible and has nothing in common with anything 
<A NAME="397"></A>else, as Anaxagoras says, how can it come to think at all? For interaction 
<A NAME="398"></A>between two factors is held to require a precedent community of nature 
<A NAME="399"></A>between the factors. Again it might be asked, is mind a possible object 
<A NAME="400"></A>of thought to itself? For if mind is thinkable per se and what is thinkable 
<A NAME="401"></A>is in kind one and the same, then either (a) mind will belong to everything, 
<A NAME="402"></A>or (b) mind will contain some element common to it with all other realities 
<A NAME="403"></A>which makes them all thinkable.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>(1) Have not we already disposed of the difficulty about interaction 
<A NAME="405"></A>involving a common element, when we said that mind is in a sense potentially 
<A NAME="406"></A>whatever is thinkable, though actually it is nothing until it has thought? 
<A NAME="407"></A>What it thinks must be in it just as characters may be said to be on a 
<A NAME="408"></A>writingtablet on which as yet nothing actually stands written: this is 
<A NAME="409"></A>exactly what happens with mind.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>(Mind is itself thinkable in exactly the same way as its objects 
<A NAME="411"></A>are. For (a) in the case of objects which involve no matter, what thinks 
<A NAME="412"></A>and what is thought are identical; for speculative knowledge and its object 
<A NAME="413"></A>are identical. (Why mind is not always thinking we must consider later.) 
<A NAME="414"></A>(b) In the case of those which contain matter each of the objects of thought 
<A NAME="415"></A>is only potentially present. It follows that while they will not have mind 
<A NAME="416"></A>in them (for mind is a potentiality of them only in so far as they are 
<A NAME="417"></A>capable of being disengaged from matter) mind may yet be 
<A NAME="418"></A>thinkable.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="419"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>Since in every class of things, as in nature as a whole, we find 
<A NAME="421"></A>two factors involved, (1) a matter which is potentially all the particulars 
<A NAME="422"></A>included in the class, (2) a cause which is productive in the sense that 
<A NAME="423"></A>it makes them all (the latter standing to the former, as e.g. an art to 
<A NAME="424"></A>its material), these distinct elements must likewise be found within the 
<A NAME="425"></A>soul.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>And in fact mind as we have described it is what it is what it 
<A NAME="427"></A>is by virtue of becoming all things, while there is another which is what 
<A NAME="428"></A>it is by virtue of making all things: this is a sort of positive state 
<A NAME="429"></A>like light; for in a sense light makes potential colours into actual 
<A NAME="430"></A>colours.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR>Mind in this sense of it is separable, impassible, unmixed, since 
<A NAME="432"></A>it is in its essential nature activity (for always the active is superior 
<A NAME="433"></A>to the passive factor, the originating force to the matter which it 
<A NAME="434"></A>forms).
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>Actual knowledge is identical with its object: in the individual, 
<A NAME="436"></A>potential knowledge is in time prior to actual knowledge, but in the universe 
<A NAME="437"></A>as a whole it is not prior even in time. Mind is not at one time knowing 
<A NAME="438"></A>and at another not. When mind is set free from its present conditions it 
<A NAME="439"></A>appears as just what it is and nothing more: this alone is immortal and 
<A NAME="440"></A>eternal (we do not, however, remember its former activity because, while 
<A NAME="441"></A>mind in this sense is impassible, mind as passive is destructible), and 
<A NAME="442"></A>without it nothing thinks.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="443"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>The thinking then of the simple objects of thought is found in 
<A NAME="445"></A>those cases where falsehood is impossible: where the alternative of true 
<A NAME="446"></A>or false applies, there we always find a putting together of objects of 
<A NAME="447"></A>thought in a quasi-unity. As Empedocles said that 'where heads of many 
<A NAME="448"></A>a creature sprouted without necks' they afterwards by Love's power were 
<A NAME="449"></A>combined, so here too objects of thought which were given separate are 
<A NAME="450"></A>combined, e.g. 'incommensurate' and 'diagonal': if the combination be of 
<A NAME="451"></A>objects past or future the combination of thought includes in its content 
<A NAME="452"></A>the date. For falsehood always involves a synthesis; for even if you assert 
<A NAME="453"></A>that what is white is not white you have included not white in a synthesis. 
<A NAME="454"></A>It is possible also to call all these cases division as well as combination. 
<A NAME="455"></A>However that may be, there is not only the true or false assertion that 
<A NAME="456"></A>Cleon is white but also the true or false assertion that he was or will 
<A NAME="457"></A>he white. In each and every case that which unifies is 
<A NAME="458"></A>mind.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>Since the word 'simple' has two senses, i.e. may mean either (a) 
<A NAME="460"></A>'not capable of being divided' or (b) 'not actually divided', there is 
<A NAME="461"></A>nothing to prevent mind from knowing what is undivided, e.g. when it apprehends 
<A NAME="462"></A>a length (which is actually undivided) and that in an undivided time; for 
<A NAME="463"></A>the time is divided or undivided in the same manner as the line. It is 
<A NAME="464"></A>not possible, then, to tell what part of the line it was apprehending in 
<A NAME="465"></A>each half of the time: the object has no actual parts until it has been 
<A NAME="466"></A>divided: if in thought you think each half separately, then by the same 
<A NAME="467"></A>act you divide the time also, the half-lines becoming as it were new wholes 
<A NAME="468"></A>of length. But if you think it as a whole consisting of these two possible 
<A NAME="469"></A>parts, then also you think it in a time which corresponds to both parts 
<A NAME="470"></A>together. (But what is not quantitatively but qualitatively simple is thought 
<A NAME="471"></A>in a simple time and by a simple act of the soul.)
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>But that which mind thinks and the time in which it thinks are 
<A NAME="473"></A>in this case divisible only incidentally and not as such. For in them too 
<A NAME="474"></A>there is something indivisible (though, it may be, not isolable) which 
<A NAME="475"></A>gives unity to the time and the whole of length; and this is found equally 
<A NAME="476"></A>in every continuum whether temporal or spatial.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR>Points and similar instances of things that divide, themselves 
<A NAME="478"></A>being indivisible, are realized in consciousness in the same manner as 
<A NAME="479"></A>privations.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR>A similar account may be given of all other cases, e.g. how evil 
<A NAME="481"></A>or black is cognized; they are cognized, in a sense, by means of their 
<A NAME="482"></A>contraries. That which cognizes must have an element of potentiality in 
<A NAME="483"></A>its being, and one of the contraries must be in it. But if there is anything 
<A NAME="484"></A>that has no contrary, then it knows itself and is actually and possesses 
<A NAME="485"></A>independent existence.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>Assertion is the saying of something concerning something, e.g. 
<A NAME="487"></A>affirmation, and is in every case either true or false: this is not always 
<A NAME="488"></A>the case with mind: the thinking of the definition in the sense of the 
<A NAME="489"></A>constitutive essence is never in error nor is it the assertion of something 
<A NAME="490"></A>concerning something, but, just as while the seeing of the special object 
<A NAME="491"></A>of sight can never be in error, the belief that the white object seen is 
<A NAME="492"></A>a man may be mistaken, so too in the case of objects which are without 
<A NAME="493"></A>matter.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="494"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>Actual knowledge is identical with its object: potential knowledge 
<A NAME="496"></A>in the individual is in time prior to actual knowledge but in the universe 
<A NAME="497"></A>it has no priority even in time; for all things that come into being arise 
<A NAME="498"></A>from what actually is. In the case of sense clearly the sensitive faculty 
<A NAME="499"></A>already was potentially what the object makes it to be actually; the faculty 
<A NAME="500"></A>is not affected or altered. This must therefore be a different kind from 
<A NAME="501"></A>movement; for movement is, as we saw, an activity of what is imperfect, 
<A NAME="502"></A>activity in the unqualified sense, i.e. that of what has been perfected, 
<A NAME="503"></A>is different from movement.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>To perceive then is like bare asserting or knowing; but when the 
<A NAME="505"></A>object is pleasant or painful, the soul makes a quasi-affirmation or negation, 
<A NAME="506"></A>and pursues or avoids the object. To feel pleasure or pain is to act with 
<A NAME="507"></A>the sensitive mean towards what is good or bad as such. Both avoidance 
<A NAME="508"></A>and appetite when actual are identical with this: the faculty of appetite 
<A NAME="509"></A>and avoidance are not different, either from one another or from the faculty 
<A NAME="510"></A>of sense-perception; but their being is different.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>To the thinking soul images serve as if they were contents of perception 
<A NAME="512"></A>(and when it asserts or denies them to be good or bad it avoids or pursues 
<A NAME="513"></A>them). That is why the soul never thinks without an image. The process 
<A NAME="514"></A>is like that in which the air modifies the pupil in this or that way and 
<A NAME="515"></A>the pupil transmits the modification to some third thing (and similarly 
<A NAME="516"></A>in hearing), while the ultimate point of arrival is one, a single mean, 
<A NAME="517"></A>with different manners of being.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>With what part of itself the soul discriminates sweet from hot 
<A NAME="519"></A>I have explained before and must now describe again as follows: That with 
<A NAME="520"></A>which it does so is a sort of unity, but in the way just mentioned, i.e. 
<A NAME="521"></A>as a connecting term. And the two faculties it connects, being one by analogy 
<A NAME="522"></A>and numerically, are each to each as the qualities discerned are to one 
<A NAME="523"></A>another (for what difference does it make whether we raise the problem 
<A NAME="524"></A>of discrimination between disparates or between contraries, e.g. white 
<A NAME="525"></A>and black?). Let then C be to D as is to B: it follows alternando that 
<A NAME="526"></A>C: A:: D: B. If then C and D belong to one subject, the case will be the 
<A NAME="527"></A>same with them as with and B; and B form a single identity with different 
<A NAME="528"></A>modes of being; so too will the former pair. The same reasoning holds if 
<A NAME="529"></A>be sweet and B white.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>The faculty of thinking then thinks the forms in the images, and 
<A NAME="531"></A>as in the former case what is to be pursued or avoided is marked out for 
<A NAME="532"></A>it, so where there is no sensation and it is engaged upon the images it 
<A NAME="533"></A>is moved to pursuit or avoidance. E.g.. perceiving by sense that the beacon 
<A NAME="534"></A>is fire, it recognizes in virtue of the general faculty of sense that it 
<A NAME="535"></A>signifies an enemy, because it sees it moving; but sometimes by means of 
<A NAME="536"></A>the images or thoughts which are within the soul, just as if it were seeing, 
<A NAME="537"></A>it calculates and deliberates what is to come by reference to what is present; 
<A NAME="538"></A>and when it makes a pronouncement, as in the case of sensation it pronounces 
<A NAME="539"></A>the object to be pleasant or painful, in this case it avoids or persues 
<A NAME="540"></A>and so generally in cases of action.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR>That too which involves no action, i.e. that which is true or false, 
<A NAME="542"></A>is in the same province with what is good or bad: yet they differ in this, 
<A NAME="543"></A>that the one set imply and the other do not a reference to a particular 
<A NAME="544"></A>person.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>The so-called abstract objects the mind thinks just as, if one 
<A NAME="546"></A>had thought of the snubnosed not as snub-nosed but as hollow, one would 
<A NAME="547"></A>have thought of an actuality without the flesh in which it is embodied: 
<A NAME="548"></A>it is thus that the mind when it is thinking the objects of Mathematics 
<A NAME="549"></A>thinks as separate elements which do not exist separate. In every case 
<A NAME="550"></A>the mind which is actively thinking is the objects which it thinks. Whether 
<A NAME="551"></A>it is possible for it while not existing separate from spatial conditions 
<A NAME="552"></A>to think anything that is separate, or not, we must consider 
<A NAME="553"></A>later.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="554"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="555"></A><BR><BR>Let us now summarize our results about soul, and repeat that the 
<A NAME="556"></A>soul is in a way all existing things; for existing things are either sensible 
<A NAME="557"></A>or thinkable, and knowledge is in a way what is knowable, and sensation 
<A NAME="558"></A>is in a way what is sensible: in what way we must inquire.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>Knowledge and sensation are divided to correspond with the realities, 
<A NAME="560"></A>potential knowledge and sensation answering to potentialities, actual knowledge 
<A NAME="561"></A>and sensation to actualities. Within the soul the faculties of knowledge 
<A NAME="562"></A>and sensation are potentially these objects, the one what is knowable, 
<A NAME="563"></A>the other what is sensible. They must be either the things themselves or 
<A NAME="564"></A>their forms. The former alternative is of course impossible: it is not 
<A NAME="565"></A>the stone which is present in the soul but its form.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>It follows that the soul is analogous to the hand; for as the hand 
<A NAME="567"></A>is a tool of tools, so the mind is the form of forms and sense the form 
<A NAME="568"></A>of sensible things.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>Since according to common agreement there is nothing outside and 
<A NAME="570"></A>separate in existence from sensible spatial magnitudes, the objects of 
<A NAME="571"></A>thought are in the sensible forms, viz. both the abstract objects and all 
<A NAME="572"></A>the states and affections of sensible things. Hence (1) no one can learn 
<A NAME="573"></A>or understand anything in the absence of sense, and (when the mind is actively 
<A NAME="574"></A>aware of anything it is necessarily aware of it along with an image; for 
<A NAME="575"></A>images are like sensuous contents except in that they contain no 
<A NAME="576"></A>matter.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR>Imagination is different from assertion and denial; for what is 
<A NAME="578"></A>true or false involves a synthesis of concepts. In what will the primary 
<A NAME="579"></A>concepts differ from images? Must we not say that neither these nor even 
<A NAME="580"></A>our other concepts are images, though they necessarily involve 
<A NAME="581"></A>them?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="582"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR>The soul of animals is characterized by two faculties, (a) the 
<A NAME="584"></A>faculty of discrimination which is the work of thought and sense, and (b) 
<A NAME="585"></A>the faculty of originating local movement. Sense and mind we have now sufficiently 
<A NAME="586"></A>examined. Let us next consider what it is in the soul which originates 
<A NAME="587"></A>movement. Is it a single part of the soul separate either spatially or 
<A NAME="588"></A>in definition? Or is it the soul as a whole? If it is a part, is that part 
<A NAME="589"></A>different from those usually distinguished or already mentioned by us, 
<A NAME="590"></A>or is it one of them? The problem at once presents itself, in what sense 
<A NAME="591"></A>we are to speak of parts of the soul, or how many we should distinguish. 
<A NAME="592"></A>For in a sense there is an infinity of parts: it is not enough to distinguish, 
<A NAME="593"></A>with some thinkers, the calculative, the passionate, and the desiderative, 
<A NAME="594"></A>or with others the rational and the irrational; for if we take the dividing 
<A NAME="595"></A>lines followed by these thinkers we shall find parts far more distinctly 
<A NAME="596"></A>separated from one another than these, namely those we have just mentioned: 
<A NAME="597"></A>(1) the nutritive, which belongs both to plants and to all animals, and 
<A NAME="598"></A>(2) the sensitive, which cannot easily be classed as either irrational 
<A NAME="599"></A>or rational; further (3) the imaginative, which is, in its being, different 
<A NAME="600"></A>from all, while it is very hard to say with which of the others it is the 
<A NAME="601"></A>same or not the same, supposing we determine to posit separate parts in 
<A NAME="602"></A>the soul; and lastly (4) the appetitive, which would seem to be distinct 
<A NAME="603"></A>both in definition and in power from all hitherto enumerated.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR>It is absurd to break up the last-mentioned faculty: as these thinkers 
<A NAME="605"></A>do, for wish is found in the calculative part and desire and passion in 
<A NAME="606"></A>the irrational; and if the soul is tripartite appetite will be found in 
<A NAME="607"></A>all three parts. Turning our attention to the present object of discussion, 
<A NAME="608"></A>let us ask what that is which originates local movement of the 
<A NAME="609"></A>animal.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>The movement of growth and decay, being found in all living things, 
<A NAME="611"></A>must be attributed to the faculty of reproduction and nutrition, which 
<A NAME="612"></A>is common to all: inspiration and expiration, sleep and waking, we must 
<A NAME="613"></A>consider later: these too present much difficulty: at present we must consider 
<A NAME="614"></A>local movement, asking what it is that originates forward movement in the 
<A NAME="615"></A>animal.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>That it is not the nutritive faculty is obvious; for this kind 
<A NAME="617"></A>of movement is always for an end and is accompanied either by imagination 
<A NAME="618"></A>or by appetite; for no animal moves except by compulsion unless it has 
<A NAME="619"></A>an impulse towards or away from an object. Further, if it were the nutritive 
<A NAME="620"></A>faculty, even plants would have been capable of originating such movement 
<A NAME="621"></A>and would have possessed the organs necessary to carry it out. Similarly 
<A NAME="622"></A>it cannot be the sensitive faculty either; for there are many animals which 
<A NAME="623"></A>have sensibility but remain fast and immovable throughout their 
<A NAME="624"></A>lives.
<A NAME="625"></A><BR><BR>If then Nature never makes anything without a purpose and never 
<A NAME="626"></A>leaves out what is necessary (except in the case of mutilated or imperfect 
<A NAME="627"></A>growths; and that here we have neither mutilation nor imperfection may 
<A NAME="628"></A>be argued from the facts that such animals (a) can reproduce their species 
<A NAME="629"></A>and (b) rise to completeness of nature and decay to an end), it follows 
<A NAME="630"></A>that, had they been capable of originating forward movement, they would 
<A NAME="631"></A>have possessed the organs necessary for that purpose. Further, neither 
<A NAME="632"></A>can the calculative faculty or what is called 'mind' be the cause of such 
<A NAME="633"></A>movement; for mind as speculative never thinks what is practicable, it 
<A NAME="634"></A>never says anything about an object to be avoided or pursued, while this 
<A NAME="635"></A>movement is always in something which is avoiding or pursuing an object. 
<A NAME="636"></A>No, not even when it is aware of such an object does it at once enjoin 
<A NAME="637"></A>pursuit or avoidance of it; e.g. the mind often thinks of something terrifying 
<A NAME="638"></A>or pleasant without enjoining the emotion of fear. It is the heart that 
<A NAME="639"></A>is moved (or in the case of a pleasant object some other part). Further, 
<A NAME="640"></A>even when the mind does command and thought bids us pursue or avoid something, 
<A NAME="641"></A>sometimes no movement is produced; we act in accordance with desire, as 
<A NAME="642"></A>in the case of moral weakness. And, generally, we observe that the possessor 
<A NAME="643"></A>of medical knowledge is not necessarily healing, which shows that something 
<A NAME="644"></A>else is required to produce action in accordance with knowledge; the knowledge 
<A NAME="645"></A>alone is not the cause. Lastly, appetite too is incompetent to account 
<A NAME="646"></A>fully for movement; for those who successfully resist temptation have appetite 
<A NAME="647"></A>and desire and yet follow mind and refuse to enact that for which they 
<A NAME="648"></A>have appetite.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="649"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="650"></A><BR><BR>These two at all events appear to be sources of movement: appetite 
<A NAME="651"></A>and mind (if one may venture to regard imagination as a kind of thinking; 
<A NAME="652"></A>for many men follow their imaginations contrary to knowledge, and in all 
<A NAME="653"></A>animals other than man there is no thinking or calculation but only 
<A NAME="654"></A>imagination).
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>Both of these then are capable of originating local movement, mind 
<A NAME="656"></A>and appetite: (1) mind, that is, which calculates means to an end, i.e. 
<A NAME="657"></A>mind practical (it differs from mind speculative in the character of its 
<A NAME="658"></A>end); while (2) appetite is in every form of it relative to an end: for 
<A NAME="659"></A>that which is the object of appetite is the stimulant of mind practical; 
<A NAME="660"></A>and that which is last in the process of thinking is the beginning of the 
<A NAME="661"></A>action. It follows that there is a justification for regarding these two 
<A NAME="662"></A>as the sources of movement, i.e. appetite and practical thought; for the 
<A NAME="663"></A>object of appetite starts a movement and as a result of that thought gives 
<A NAME="664"></A>rise to movement, the object of appetite being it a source of stimulation. 
<A NAME="665"></A>So too when imagination originates movement, it necessarily involves 
<A NAME="666"></A>appetite.
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>That which moves therefore is a single faculty and the faculty 
<A NAME="668"></A>of appetite; for if there had been two sources of movement-mind and appetite-they 
<A NAME="669"></A>would have produced movement in virtue of some common character. As it 
<A NAME="670"></A>is, mind is never found producing movement without appetite (for wish is 
<A NAME="671"></A>a form of appetite; and when movement is produced according to calculation 
<A NAME="672"></A>it is also according to wish), but appetite can originate movement contrary 
<A NAME="673"></A>to calculation, for desire is a form of appetite. Now mind is always right, 
<A NAME="674"></A>but appetite and imagination may be either right or wrong. That is why, 
<A NAME="675"></A>though in any case it is the object of appetite which originates movement, 
<A NAME="676"></A>this object may be either the real or the apparent good. To produce movement 
<A NAME="677"></A>the object must be more than this: it must be good that can be brought 
<A NAME="678"></A>into being by action; and only what can be otherwise than as it is can 
<A NAME="679"></A>thus be brought into being. That then such a power in the soul as has been 
<A NAME="680"></A>described, i.e. that called appetite, originates movement is clear. Those 
<A NAME="681"></A>who distinguish parts in the soul, if they distinguish and divide in accordance 
<A NAME="682"></A>with differences of power, find themselves with a very large number of 
<A NAME="683"></A>parts, a nutritive, a sensitive, an intellective, a deliberative, and now 
<A NAME="684"></A>an appetitive part; for these are more different from one another than 
<A NAME="685"></A>the faculties of desire and passion.
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR>Since appetites run counter to one another, which happens when 
<A NAME="687"></A>a principle of reason and a desire are contrary and is possible only in 
<A NAME="688"></A>beings with a sense of time (for while mind bids us hold back because of 
<A NAME="689"></A>what is future, desire is influenced by what is just at hand: a pleasant 
<A NAME="690"></A>object which is just at hand presents itself as both pleasant and good, 
<A NAME="691"></A>without condition in either case, because of want of foresight into what 
<A NAME="692"></A>is farther away in time), it follows that while that which originates movement 
<A NAME="693"></A>must be specifically one, viz. the faculty of appetite as such (or rather 
<A NAME="694"></A>farthest back of all the object of that faculty; for it is it that itself 
<A NAME="695"></A>remaining unmoved originates the movement by being apprehended in thought 
<A NAME="696"></A>or imagination), the things that originate movement are numerically 
<A NAME="697"></A>many.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR><BR>All movement involves three factors, (1) that which originates 
<A NAME="699"></A>the movement, (2) that by means of which it originates it, and (3) that 
<A NAME="700"></A>which is moved. The expression 'that which originates the movement' is 
<A NAME="701"></A>ambiguous: it may mean either (a) something which itself is unmoved or 
<A NAME="702"></A>(b) that which at once moves and is moved. Here that which moves without 
<A NAME="703"></A>itself being moved is the realizable good, that which at once moves and 
<A NAME="704"></A>is moved is the faculty of appetite (for that which is influenced by appetite 
<A NAME="705"></A>so far as it is actually so influenced is set in movement, and appetite 
<A NAME="706"></A>in the sense of actual appetite is a kind of movement), while that which 
<A NAME="707"></A>is in motion is the animal. The instrument which appetite employs to produce 
<A NAME="708"></A>movement is no longer psychical but bodily: hence the examination of it 
<A NAME="709"></A>falls within the province of the functions common to body and soul. To 
<A NAME="710"></A>state the matter summarily at present, that which is the instrument in 
<A NAME="711"></A>the production of movement is to be found where a beginning and an end 
<A NAME="712"></A>coincide as e.g. in a ball and socket joint; for there the convex and the 
<A NAME="713"></A>concave sides are respectively an end and a beginning (that is why while 
<A NAME="714"></A>the one remains at rest, the other is moved): they are separate in definition 
<A NAME="715"></A>but not separable spatially. For everything is moved by pushing and pulling. 
<A NAME="716"></A>Hence just as in the case of a wheel, so here there must be a point which 
<A NAME="717"></A>remains at rest, and from that point the movement must 
<A NAME="718"></A>originate.
<A NAME="719"></A><BR><BR>To sum up, then, and repeat what I have said, inasmuch as an animal 
<A NAME="720"></A>is capable of appetite it is capable of self-movement; it is not capable 
<A NAME="721"></A>of appetite without possessing imagination; and all imagination is either 
<A NAME="722"></A>(1) calculative or (2) sensitive. In the latter an animals, and not only 
<A NAME="723"></A>man, partake.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="724"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR>We must consider also in the case of imperfect animals, sc. those 
<A NAME="726"></A>which have no sense but touch, what it is that in them originates movement. 
<A NAME="727"></A>Can they have imagination or not? or desire? Clearly they have feelings 
<A NAME="728"></A>of pleasure and pain, and if they have these they must have desire. But 
<A NAME="729"></A>how can they have imagination? Must not we say that, as their movements 
<A NAME="730"></A>are indefinite, they have imagination and desire, but 
<A NAME="731"></A>indefinitely?
<A NAME="732"></A><BR><BR>Sensitive imagination, as we have said, is found in all animals, 
<A NAME="733"></A>deliberative imagination only in those that are calculative: for whether 
<A NAME="734"></A>this or that shall be enacted is already a task requiring calculation; 
<A NAME="735"></A>and there must be a single standard to measure by, for that is pursued 
<A NAME="736"></A>which is greater. It follows that what acts in this way must be able to 
<A NAME="737"></A>make a unity out of several images.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>This is the reason why imagination is held not to involve opinion, 
<A NAME="739"></A>in that it does not involve opinion based on inference, though opinion 
<A NAME="740"></A>involves imagination. Hence appetite contains no deliberative element. 
<A NAME="741"></A>Sometimes it overpowers wish and sets it in movement: at times wish acts 
<A NAME="742"></A>thus upon appetite, like one sphere imparting its movement to another, 
<A NAME="743"></A>or appetite acts thus upon appetite, i.e. in the condition of moral weakness 
<A NAME="744"></A>(though by nature the higher faculty is always more authoritative and gives 
<A NAME="745"></A>rise to movement). Thus three modes of movement are 
<A NAME="746"></A>possible.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>The faculty of knowing is never moved but remains at rest. Since 
<A NAME="748"></A>the one premiss or judgement is universal and the other deals with the 
<A NAME="749"></A>particular (for the first tells us that such and such a kind of man should 
<A NAME="750"></A>do such and such a kind of act, and the second that this is an act of the 
<A NAME="751"></A>kind meant, and I a person of the type intended), it is the latter opinion 
<A NAME="752"></A>that really originates movement, not the universal; or rather it is both, 
<A NAME="753"></A>but the one does so while it remains in a state more like rest, while the 
<A NAME="754"></A>other partakes in movement.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="755"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>The nutritive soul then must be possessed by everything that is 
<A NAME="757"></A>alive, and every such thing is endowed with soul from its birth to its 
<A NAME="758"></A>death. For what has been born must grow, reach maturity, and decay-all 
<A NAME="759"></A>of which are impossible without nutrition. Therefore the nutritive faculty 
<A NAME="760"></A>must be found in everything that grows and decays.
<A NAME="761"></A><BR><BR>But sensation need not be found in all things that live. For it 
<A NAME="762"></A>is impossible for touch to belong either (1) to those whose body is uncompounded 
<A NAME="763"></A>or (2) to those which are incapable of taking in the forms without their 
<A NAME="764"></A>matter.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR>But animals must be endowed with sensation, since Nature does nothing 
<A NAME="766"></A>in vain. For all things that exist by Nature are means to an end, or will 
<A NAME="767"></A>be concomitants of means to an end. Every body capable of forward movement 
<A NAME="768"></A>would, if unendowed with sensation, perish and fail to reach its end, which 
<A NAME="769"></A>is the aim of Nature; for how could it obtain nutriment? Stationary living 
<A NAME="770"></A>things, it is true, have as their nutriment that from which they have arisen; 
<A NAME="771"></A>but it is not possible that a body which is not stationary but produced 
<A NAME="772"></A>by generation should have a soul and a discerning mind without also having 
<A NAME="773"></A>sensation. (Nor yet even if it were not produced by generation. Why should 
<A NAME="774"></A>it not have sensation? Because it were better so either for the body or 
<A NAME="775"></A>for the soul? But clearly it would not be better for either: the absence 
<A NAME="776"></A>of sensation will not enable the one to think better or the other to exist 
<A NAME="777"></A>better.) Therefore no body which is not stationary has soul without 
<A NAME="778"></A>sensation.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR>But if a body has sensation, it must be either simple or compound. 
<A NAME="780"></A>And simple it cannot be; for then it could not have touch, which is indispensable. 
<A NAME="781"></A>This is clear from what follows. An animal is a body with soul in it: every 
<A NAME="782"></A>body is tangible, i.e. perceptible by touch; hence necessarily, if an animal 
<A NAME="783"></A>is to survive, its body must have tactual sensation. All the other senses, 
<A NAME="784"></A>e.g. smell, sight, hearing, apprehend through media; but where there is 
<A NAME="785"></A>immediate contact the animal, if it has no sensation, will be unable to 
<A NAME="786"></A>avoid some things and take others, and so will find it impossible to survive. 
<A NAME="787"></A>That is why taste also is a sort of touch; it is relative to nutriment, 
<A NAME="788"></A>which is just tangible body; whereas sound, colour, and odour are innutritious, 
<A NAME="789"></A>and further neither grow nor decay. Hence it is that taste also must be 
<A NAME="790"></A>a sort of touch, because it is the sense for what is tangible and 
<A NAME="791"></A>nutritious.
<A NAME="792"></A><BR><BR>Both these senses, then, are indispensable to the animal, and it 
<A NAME="793"></A>is clear that without touch it is impossible for an animal to be. All the 
<A NAME="794"></A>other senses subserve well-being and for that very reason belong not to 
<A NAME="795"></A>any and every kind of animal, but only to some, e.g. those capable of forward 
<A NAME="796"></A>movement must have them; for, if they are to survive, they must perceive 
<A NAME="797"></A>not only by immediate contact but also at a distance from the object. This 
<A NAME="798"></A>will be possible if they can perceive through a medium, the medium being 
<A NAME="799"></A>affected and moved by the perceptible object, and the animal by the medium. 
<A NAME="800"></A>just as that which produces local movement causes a change extending to 
<A NAME="801"></A>a certain point, and that which gave an impulse causes another to produce 
<A NAME="802"></A>a new impulse so that the movement traverses a medium the first mover impelling 
<A NAME="803"></A>without being impelled, the last moved being impelled without impelling, 
<A NAME="804"></A>while the medium (or media, for there are many) is both-so is it also in 
<A NAME="805"></A>the case of alteration, except that the agent produces produces it without 
<A NAME="806"></A>the patient's changing its place. Thus if an object is dipped into wax, 
<A NAME="807"></A>the movement goes on until submersion has taken place, and in stone it 
<A NAME="808"></A>goes no distance at all, while in water the disturbance goes far beyond 
<A NAME="809"></A>the object dipped: in air the disturbance is propagated farthest of all, 
<A NAME="810"></A>the air acting and being acted upon, so long as it maintains an unbroken 
<A NAME="811"></A>unity. That is why in the case of reflection it is better, instead of saying 
<A NAME="812"></A>that the sight issues from the eye and is reflected, to say that the air, 
<A NAME="813"></A>so long as it remains one, is affected by the shape and colour. On a smooth 
<A NAME="814"></A>surface the air possesses unity; hence it is that it in turn sets the sight 
<A NAME="815"></A>in motion, just as if the impression on the wax were transmitted as far 
<A NAME="816"></A>as the wax extends.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="817"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="818"></A><BR><BR>It is clear that the body of an animal cannot be simple, i.e. consist 
<A NAME="819"></A>of one element such as fire or air. For without touch it is impossible 
<A NAME="820"></A>to have any other sense; for every body that has soul in it must, as we 
<A NAME="821"></A>have said, be capable of touch. All the other elements with the exception 
<A NAME="822"></A>of earth can constitute organs of sense, but all of them bring about perception 
<A NAME="823"></A>only through something else, viz. through the media. Touch takes place 
<A NAME="824"></A>by direct contact with its objects, whence also its name. All the other 
<A NAME="825"></A>organs of sense, no doubt, perceive by contact, only the contact is mediate: 
<A NAME="826"></A>touch alone perceives by immediate contact. Consequently no animal body 
<A NAME="827"></A>can consist of these other elements.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR><BR>Nor can it consist solely of earth. For touch is as it were a mean 
<A NAME="829"></A>between all tangible qualities, and its organ is capable of receiving not 
<A NAME="830"></A>only all the specific qualities which characterize earth, but also the 
<A NAME="831"></A>hot and the cold and all other tangible qualities whatsoever. That is why 
<A NAME="832"></A>we have no sensation by means of bones, hair, &c., because they consist 
<A NAME="833"></A>of earth. So too plants, because they consist of earth, have no sensation. 
<A NAME="834"></A>Without touch there can be no other sense, and the organ of touch cannot 
<A NAME="835"></A>consist of earth or of any other single element.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR><BR>It is evident, therefore, that the loss of this one sense alone 
<A NAME="837"></A>must bring about the death of an animal. For as on the one hand nothing 
<A NAME="838"></A>which is not an animal can have this sense, so on the other it is the only 
<A NAME="839"></A>one which is indispensably necessary to what is an animal. This explains, 
<A NAME="840"></A>further, the following difference between the other senses and touch. In 
<A NAME="841"></A>the case of all the others excess of intensity in the qualities which they 
<A NAME="842"></A>apprehend, i.e. excess of intensity in colour, sound, and smell, destroys 
<A NAME="843"></A>not the but only the organs of the sense (except incidentally, as when 
<A NAME="844"></A>the sound is accompanied by an impact or shock, or where through the objects 
<A NAME="845"></A>of sight or of smell certain other things are set in motion, which destroy 
<A NAME="846"></A>by contact); flavour also destroys only in so far as it is at the same 
<A NAME="847"></A>time tangible. But excess of intensity in tangible qualities, e.g. heat, 
<A NAME="848"></A>cold, or hardness, destroys the animal itself. As in the case of every 
<A NAME="849"></A>sensible quality excess destroys the organ, so here what is tangible destroys 
<A NAME="850"></A>touch, which is the essential mark of life; for it has been shown that 
<A NAME="851"></A>without touch it is impossible for an animal to be. That is why excess 
<A NAME="852"></A>in intensity of tangible qualities destroys not merely the organ, but the 
<A NAME="853"></A>animal itself, because this is the only sense which it must 
<A NAME="854"></A>have.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR>All the other senses are necessary to animals, as we have said, 
<A NAME="856"></A>not for their being, but for their well-being. Such, e.g. is sight, which, 
<A NAME="857"></A>since it lives in air or water, or generally in what is pellucid, it must 
<A NAME="858"></A>have in order to see, and taste because of what is pleasant or painful 
<A NAME="859"></A>to it, in order that it may perceive these qualities in its nutriment and 
<A NAME="860"></A>so may desire to be set in motion, and hearing that it may have communication 
<A NAME="861"></A>made to it, and a tongue that it may communicate with its 
<A NAME="862"></A>fellows.
