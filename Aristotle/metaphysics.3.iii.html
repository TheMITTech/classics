<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>"WE must, with a view to the science which we are seeking, first 
<A NAME="13"></A>recount the subjects that should be first discussed. These include both 
<A NAME="14"></A>the other opinions that some have held on the first principles, and any 
<A NAME="15"></A>point besides these that happens to have been overlooked. For those who 
<A NAME="16"></A>wish to get clear of difficulties it is advantageous to discuss the difficulties 
<A NAME="17"></A>well; for the subsequent free play of thought implies the solution of the 
<A NAME="18"></A>previous difficulties, and it is not possible to untie a knot of which 
<A NAME="19"></A>one does not know. But the difficulty of our thinking points to a 'knot' 
<A NAME="20"></A>in the object; for in so far as our thought is in difficulties, it is in 
<A NAME="21"></A>like case with those who are bound; for in either case it is impossible 
<A NAME="22"></A>to go forward. Hence one should have surveyed all the difficulties beforehand, 
<A NAME="23"></A>both for the purposes we have stated and because people who inquire without 
<A NAME="24"></A>first stating the difficulties are like those who do not know where they 
<A NAME="25"></A>have to go; besides, a man does not otherwise know even whether he has 
<A NAME="26"></A>at any given time found what he is looking for or not; for the end is not 
<A NAME="27"></A>clear to such a man, while to him who has first discussed the difficulties 
<A NAME="28"></A>it is clear. Further, he who has heard all the contending arguments, as 
<A NAME="29"></A>if they were the parties to a case, must be in a better position for judging. 
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>"The first problem concerns the subject which we discussed in our 
<A NAME="31"></A>prefatory remarks. It is this-(1) whether the investigation of the causes 
<A NAME="32"></A>belongs to one or to more sciences, and (2) whether such a science should 
<A NAME="33"></A>survey only the first principles of substance, or also the principles on 
<A NAME="34"></A>which all men base their proofs, e.g. whether it is possible at the same 
<A NAME="35"></A>time to assert and deny one and the same thing or not, and all other such 
<A NAME="36"></A>questions; and (3) if the science in question deals with substance, whether 
<A NAME="37"></A>one science deals with all substances, or more than one, and if more, whether 
<A NAME="38"></A>all are akin, or some of them must be called forms of Wisdom and the others 
<A NAME="39"></A>something else. And (4) this itself is also one of the things that must 
<A NAME="40"></A>be discussed-whether sensible substances alone should be said to exist 
<A NAME="41"></A>or others also besides them, and whether these others are of one kind or 
<A NAME="42"></A>there are several classes of substances, as is supposed by those who believe 
<A NAME="43"></A>both in Forms and in mathematical objects intermediate between these and 
<A NAME="44"></A>sensible things. Into these questions, then, as we say, we must inquire, 
<A NAME="45"></A>and also (5) whether our investigation is concerned only with substances 
<A NAME="46"></A>or also with the essential attributes of substances. Further, with regard 
<A NAME="47"></A>to the same and other and like and unlike and contrariety, and with regard 
<A NAME="48"></A>to prior and posterior and all other such terms about which the dialecticians 
<A NAME="49"></A>try to inquire, starting their investigation from probable premises only,-whose 
<A NAME="50"></A>business is it to inquire into all these? Further, we must discuss the 
<A NAME="51"></A>essential attributes of these themselves; and we must ask not only what 
<A NAME="52"></A>each of these is, but also whether one thing always has one contrary. Again 
<A NAME="53"></A>(6), are the principles and elements of things the genera, or the parts 
<A NAME="54"></A>present in each thing, into which it is divided; and (7) if they are the 
<A NAME="55"></A>genera, are they the genera that are predicated proximately of the individuals, 
<A NAME="56"></A>or the highest genera, e.g. is animal or man the first principle and the 
<A NAME="57"></A>more independent of the individual instance? And (8) we must inquire and 
<A NAME="58"></A>discuss especially whether there is, besides the matter, any thing that 
<A NAME="59"></A>is a cause in itself or not, and whether this can exist apart or not, and 
<A NAME="60"></A>whether it is one or more in number, and whether there is something apart 
<A NAME="61"></A>from the concrete thing (by the concrete thing I mean the matter with something 
<A NAME="62"></A>already predicated of it), or there is nothing apart, or there is something 
<A NAME="63"></A>in some cases though not in others, and what sort of cases these are. Again 
<A NAME="64"></A>(9) we ask whether the principles are limited in number or in kind, both 
<A NAME="65"></A>those in the definitions and those in the substratum; and (10) whether 
<A NAME="66"></A>the principles of perishable and of imperishable things are the same or 
<A NAME="67"></A>different; and whether they are all imperishable or those of perishable 
<A NAME="68"></A>things are perishable. Further (11) there is the question which is hardest 
<A NAME="69"></A>of all and most perplexing, whether unity and being, as the Pythagoreans 
<A NAME="70"></A>and Plato said, are not attributes of something else but the substance 
<A NAME="71"></A>of existing things, or this is not the case, but the substratum is something 
<A NAME="72"></A>else,-as Empedocles says, love; as some one else says, fire; while another 
<A NAME="73"></A>says water or air. Again (12) we ask whether the principles are universal 
<A NAME="74"></A>or like individual things, and (13) whether they exist potentially or actually, 
<A NAME="75"></A>and further, whether they are potential or actual in any other sense than 
<A NAME="76"></A>in reference to movement; for these questions also would present much difficulty. 
<A NAME="77"></A>Further (14), are numbers and lines and figures and points a kind of substance 
<A NAME="78"></A>or not, and if they are substances are they separate from sensible things 
<A NAME="79"></A>or present in them? With regard to all these matters not only is it hard 
<A NAME="80"></A>to get possession of the truth, but it is not easy even to think out the 
<A NAME="81"></A>difficulties well.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="82"></A><B>Part 2</B>
<A NAME="83"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>"(1) First then with regard to what we mentioned first, does it 
<A NAME="85"></A>belong to one or to more sciences to investigate all the kinds of causes? 
<A NAME="86"></A>How could it belong to one science to recognize the principles if these 
<A NAME="87"></A>are not contrary? <BR><BR>"Further, there are many things to which not 
<A NAME="88"></A>all the principles pertain. For how can a principle of change or the nature 
<A NAME="89"></A>of the good exist for unchangeable things, since everything that in itself 
<A NAME="90"></A>and by its own nature is good is an end, and a cause in the sense that 
<A NAME="91"></A>for its sake the other things both come to be and are, and since an end 
<A NAME="92"></A>or purpose is the end of some action, and all actions imply change? So 
<A NAME="93"></A>in the case of unchangeable things this principle could not exist, nor 
<A NAME="94"></A>could there be a good itself. This is why in mathematics nothing is proved 
<A NAME="95"></A>by means of this kind of cause, nor is there any demonstration of this 
<A NAME="96"></A>kind-'because it is better, or worse'; indeed no one even mentions anything 
<A NAME="97"></A>of the kind. And so for this reason some of the Sophists, e.g. Aristippus, 
<A NAME="98"></A>used to ridicule mathematics; for in the arts (he maintained), even in 
<A NAME="99"></A>the industrial arts, e.g. in carpentry and cobbling, the reason always 
<A NAME="100"></A>given is 'because it is better, or worse,' but the mathematical sciences 
<A NAME="101"></A>take no account of goods and evils. <BR><BR>"But if there are several sciences 
<A NAME="102"></A>of the causes, and a different science for each different principle, which 
<A NAME="103"></A>of these sciences should be said to be that which we seek, or which of 
<A NAME="104"></A>the people who possess them has the most scientific knowledge of the object 
<A NAME="105"></A>in question? The same thing may have all the kinds of causes, e.g. the 
<A NAME="106"></A>moving cause of a house is the art or the builder, the final cause is the 
<A NAME="107"></A>function it fulfils, the matter is earth and stones, and the form is the 
<A NAME="108"></A>definition. To judge from our previous discussion of the question which 
<A NAME="109"></A>of the sciences should be called Wisdom, there is reason for applying the 
<A NAME="110"></A>name to each of them. For inasmuch as it is most architectonic and authoritative 
<A NAME="111"></A>and the other sciences, like slavewomen, may not even contradict it, the 
<A NAME="112"></A>science of the end and of the good is of the nature of Wisdom (for the 
<A NAME="113"></A>other things are for the sake of the end). But inasmuch as it was described' 
<A NAME="114"></A>as dealing with the first causes and that which is in the highest sense 
<A NAME="115"></A>object of knowledge, the science of substance must be of the nature of 
<A NAME="116"></A>Wisdom. For since men may know the same thing in many ways, we say that 
<A NAME="117"></A>he who recognizes what a thing is by its being so and so knows more fully 
<A NAME="118"></A>than he who recognizes it by its not being so and so, and in the former 
<A NAME="119"></A>class itself one knows more fully than another, and he knows most fully 
<A NAME="120"></A>who knows what a thing is, not he who knows its quantity or quality or 
<A NAME="121"></A>what it can by nature do or have done to it. And further in all cases also 
<A NAME="122"></A>we think that the knowledge of each even of the things of which demonstration 
<A NAME="123"></A>is possible is present only when we know what the thing is, e.g. what squaring 
<A NAME="124"></A>a rectangle is, viz. that it is the finding of a mean; and similarly in 
<A NAME="125"></A>all other cases. And we know about becomings and actions and about every 
<A NAME="126"></A>change when we know the source of the movement; and this is other than 
<A NAME="127"></A>and opposed to the end. Therefore it would seem to belong to different 
<A NAME="128"></A>sciences to investigate these causes severally. <BR><BR>"But (2), taking 
<A NAME="129"></A>the starting-points of demonstration as well as the causes, it is a disputable 
<A NAME="130"></A>question whether they are the object of one science or of more (by the 
<A NAME="131"></A>starting-points of demonstration I mean the common beliefs, on which all 
<A NAME="132"></A>men base their proofs); e.g. that everything must be either affirmed or 
<A NAME="133"></A>denied, and that a thing cannot at the same time be and not be, and all 
<A NAME="134"></A>other such premisses:-the question is whether the same science deals with 
<A NAME="135"></A>them as with substance, or a different science, and if it is not one science, 
<A NAME="136"></A>which of the two must be identified with that which we now seek.-It is 
<A NAME="137"></A>not reasonable that these topics should be the object of one science; for 
<A NAME="138"></A>why should it be peculiarly appropriate to geometry or to any other science 
<A NAME="139"></A>to understand these matters? If then it belongs to every science alike, 
<A NAME="140"></A>and cannot belong to all, it is not peculiar to the science which investigates 
<A NAME="141"></A>substances, any more than to any other science, to know about these topics.-And, 
<A NAME="142"></A>at the same time, in what way can there be a science of the first principles? 
<A NAME="143"></A>For we are aware even now what each of them in fact is (at least even other 
<A NAME="144"></A>sciences use them as familiar); but if there is a demonstrative science 
<A NAME="145"></A>which deals with them, there will have to be an underlying kind, and some 
<A NAME="146"></A>of them must be demonstrable attributes and others must be axioms (for 
<A NAME="147"></A>it is impossible that there should be demonstration about all of them); 
<A NAME="148"></A>for the demonstration must start from certain premisses and be about a 
<A NAME="149"></A>certain subject and prove certain attributes. Therefore it follows that 
<A NAME="150"></A>all attributes that are proved must belong to a single class; for all demonstrative 
<A NAME="151"></A>sciences use the axioms. <BR><BR>"But if the science of substance and the 
<A NAME="152"></A>science which deals with the axioms are different, which of them is by 
<A NAME="153"></A>nature more authoritative and prior? The axioms are most universal and 
<A NAME="154"></A>are principles of all things. And if it is not the business of the philosopher, 
<A NAME="155"></A>to whom else will it belong to inquire what is true and what is untrue 
<A NAME="156"></A>about them? <BR><BR>"(3) In general, do all substances fall under one science 
<A NAME="157"></A>or under more than one? If the latter, to what sort of substance is the 
<A NAME="158"></A>present science to be assigned?-On the other hand, it is not reasonable 
<A NAME="159"></A>that one science should deal with all. For then there would be one demonstrative 
<A NAME="160"></A>science dealing with all attributes. For ever demonstrative science investigates 
<A NAME="161"></A>with regard to some subject its essential attributes, starting from the 
<A NAME="162"></A>common beliefs. Therefore to investigate the essential attributes of one 
<A NAME="163"></A>class of things, starting from one set of beliefs, is the business of one 
<A NAME="164"></A>science. For the subject belongs to one science, and the premisses belong 
<A NAME="165"></A>to one, whether to the same or to another; so that the attributes do so 
<A NAME="166"></A>too, whether they are investigated by these sciences or by one compounded 
<A NAME="167"></A>out of them. <BR><BR>"(5) Further, does our investigation deal with substances 
<A NAME="168"></A>alone or also with their attributes? I mean for instance, if the solid 
<A NAME="169"></A>is a substance and so are lines and planes, is it the business of the same 
<A NAME="170"></A>science to know these and to know the attributes of each of these classes 
<A NAME="171"></A>(the attributes about which the mathematical sciences offer proofs), or 
<A NAME="172"></A>of a different science? If of the same, the science of substance also must 
<A NAME="173"></A>be a demonstrative science, but it is thought that there is no demonstration 
<A NAME="174"></A>of the essence of things. And if of another, what will be the science that 
<A NAME="175"></A>investigates the attributes of substance? This is a very difficult question. 
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>"(4) Further, must we say that sensible substances alone exist, 
<A NAME="177"></A>or that there are others besides these? And are substances of one kind 
<A NAME="178"></A>or are there in fact several kinds of substances, as those say who assert 
<A NAME="179"></A>the existence both of the Forms and of the intermediates, with which they 
<A NAME="180"></A>say the mathematical sciences deal?-The sense in which we say the Forms 
<A NAME="181"></A>are both causes and self-dependent substances has been explained in our 
<A NAME="182"></A>first remarks about them; while the theory presents difficulties in many 
<A NAME="183"></A>ways, the most paradoxical thing of all is the statement that there are 
<A NAME="184"></A>certain things besides those in the material universe, and that these are 
<A NAME="185"></A>the same as sensible things except that they are eternal while the latter 
<A NAME="186"></A>are perishable. For they say there is a man-himself and a horse-itself 
<A NAME="187"></A>and health-itself, with no further qualification,-a procedure like that 
<A NAME="188"></A>of the people who said there are gods, but in human form. For they were 
<A NAME="189"></A>positing nothing but eternal men, nor are the Platonists making the Forms 
<A NAME="190"></A>anything other than eternal sensible things. <BR><BR>"Further, if we are 
<A NAME="191"></A>to posit besides the Forms and the sensibles the intermediates between 
<A NAME="192"></A>them, we shall have many difficulties. For clearly on the same principle 
<A NAME="193"></A>there will be lines besides the lines-themselves and the sensible lines, 
<A NAME="194"></A>and so with each of the other classes of things; so that since astronomy 
<A NAME="195"></A>is one of these mathematical sciences there will also be a heaven besides 
<A NAME="196"></A>the sensible heaven, and a sun and a moon (and so with the other heavenly 
<A NAME="197"></A>bodies) besides the sensible. Yet how are we to believe in these things? 
<A NAME="198"></A>It is not reasonable even to suppose such a body immovable, but to suppose 
<A NAME="199"></A>it moving is quite impossible.-And similarly with the things of which optics 
<A NAME="200"></A>and mathematical harmonics treat; for these also cannot exist apart from 
<A NAME="201"></A>the sensible things, for the same reasons. For if there are sensible things 
<A NAME="202"></A>and sensations intermediate between Form and individual, evidently there 
<A NAME="203"></A>will also be animals intermediate between animals-themselves and the perishable 
<A NAME="204"></A>animals.-We might also raise the question, with reference to which kind 
<A NAME="205"></A>of existing things we must look for these sciences of intermediates. If 
<A NAME="206"></A>geometry is to differ from mensuration only in this, that the latter deals 
<A NAME="207"></A>with things that we perceive, and the former with things that are not perceptible, 
<A NAME="208"></A>evidently there will also be a science other than medicine, intermediate 
<A NAME="209"></A>between medical-science-itself and this individual medical science, and 
<A NAME="210"></A>so with each of the other sciences. Yet how is this possible? There would 
<A NAME="211"></A>have to be also healthy things besides the perceptible healthy things and 
<A NAME="212"></A>the healthy-itself.--And at the same time not even this is true, that mensuration 
<A NAME="213"></A>deals with perceptible and perishable magnitudes; for then it would have 
<A NAME="214"></A>perished when they perished. <BR><BR>"But on the other hand astronomy cannot 
<A NAME="215"></A>be dealing with perceptible magnitudes nor with this heaven above us. For 
<A NAME="216"></A>neither are perceptible lines such lines as the geometer speaks of (for 
<A NAME="217"></A>no perceptible thing is straight or round in the way in which he defines 
<A NAME="218"></A>'straight' and 'round'; for a hoop touches a straight edge not at a point, 
<A NAME="219"></A>but as Protagoras used to say it did, in his refutation of the geometers), 
<A NAME="220"></A>nor are the movements and spiral orbits in the heavens like those of which 
<A NAME="221"></A>astronomy treats, nor have geometrical points the same nature as the actual 
<A NAME="222"></A>stars.-Now there are some who say that these so-called intermediates between 
<A NAME="223"></A>the Forms and the perceptible things exist, not apart from the perceptible 
<A NAME="224"></A>things, however, but in these; the impossible results of this view would 
<A NAME="225"></A>take too long to enumerate, but it is enough to consider even such points 
<A NAME="226"></A>as the following:-It is not reasonable that this should be so only in the 
<A NAME="227"></A>case of these intermediates, but clearly the Forms also might be in the 
<A NAME="228"></A>perceptible things; for both statements are parts of the same theory. Further, 
<A NAME="229"></A>it follows from this theory that there are two solids in the same place, 
<A NAME="230"></A>and that the intermediates are not immovable, since they are in the moving 
<A NAME="231"></A>perceptible things. And in general to what purpose would one suppose them 
<A NAME="232"></A>to exist indeed, but to exist in perceptible things? For the same paradoxical 
<A NAME="233"></A>results will follow which we have already mentioned; there will be a heaven 
<A NAME="234"></A>besides the heaven, only it will be not apart but in the same place; which 
<A NAME="235"></A>is still more impossible.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="236"></A><B>Part 3</B>
<A NAME="237"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>"(6) Apart from the great difficulty of stating the case truly 
<A NAME="239"></A>with regard to these matters, it is very hard to say, with regard to the 
<A NAME="240"></A>first principles, whether it is the genera that should be taken as elements 
<A NAME="241"></A>and principles, or rather the primary constituents of a thing; e.g. it 
<A NAME="242"></A>is the primary parts of which articulate sounds consist that are thought 
<A NAME="243"></A>to be elements and principles of articulate sound, not the common genus-articulate 
<A NAME="244"></A>sound; and we give the name of 'elements' to those geometrical propositions, 
<A NAME="245"></A>the proofs of which are implied in the proofs of the others, either of 
<A NAME="246"></A>all or of most. Further, both those who say there are several elements 
<A NAME="247"></A>of corporeal things and those who say there is one, say the parts of which 
<A NAME="248"></A>bodies are compounded and consist are principles; e.g. Empedocles says 
<A NAME="249"></A>fire and water and the rest are the constituent elements of things, but 
<A NAME="250"></A>does not describe these as genera of existing things. Besides this, if 
<A NAME="251"></A>we want to examine the nature of anything else, we examine the parts of 
<A NAME="252"></A>which, e.g. a bed consists and how they are put together, and then we know 
<A NAME="253"></A>its nature. <BR><BR>"To judge from these arguments, then, the principles 
<A NAME="254"></A>of things would not be the genera; but if we know each thing by its definition, 
<A NAME="255"></A>and the genera are the principles or starting-points of definitions, the 
<A NAME="256"></A>genera must also be the principles of definable things. And if to get the 
<A NAME="257"></A>knowledge of the species according to which things are named is to get 
<A NAME="258"></A>the knowledge of things, the genera are at least starting-points of the 
<A NAME="259"></A>species. And some also of those who say unity or being, or the great and 
<A NAME="260"></A>the small, are elements of things, seem to treat them as genera. <BR><BR>"But, 
<A NAME="261"></A>again, it is not possible to describe the principles in both ways. For 
<A NAME="262"></A>the formula of the essence is one; but definition by genera will be different 
<A NAME="263"></A>from that which states the constituent parts of a thing. <BR><BR>"(7) Besides 
<A NAME="264"></A>this, even if the genera are in the highest degree principles, should one 
<A NAME="265"></A>regard the first of the genera as principles, or those which are predicated 
<A NAME="266"></A>directly of the individuals? This also admits of dispute. For if the universals 
<A NAME="267"></A>are always more of the nature of principles, evidently the uppermost of 
<A NAME="268"></A>the genera are the principles; for these are predicated of all things. 
<A NAME="269"></A>There will, then, be as many principles of things as there are primary 
<A NAME="270"></A>genera, so that both being and unity will be principles and substances; 
<A NAME="271"></A>for these are most of all predicated of all existing things. But it is 
<A NAME="272"></A>not possible that either unity or being should be a single genus of things; 
<A NAME="273"></A>for the differentiae of any genus must each of them both have being and 
<A NAME="274"></A>be one, but it is not possible for the genus taken apart from its species 
<A NAME="275"></A>(any more than for the species of the genus) to be predicated of its proper 
<A NAME="276"></A>differentiae; so that if unity or being is a genus, no differentia will 
<A NAME="277"></A>either have being or be one. But if unity and being are not genera, neither 
<A NAME="278"></A>will they be principles, if the genera are the principles. Again, the intermediate 
<A NAME="279"></A>kinds, in whose nature the differentiae are included, will on this theory 
<A NAME="280"></A>be genera, down to the indivisible species; but as it is, some are thought 
<A NAME="281"></A>to be genera and others are not thought to be so. Besides this, the differentiae 
<A NAME="282"></A>are principles even more than the genera; and if these also are principles, 
<A NAME="283"></A>there comes to be practically an infinite number of principles, especially 
<A NAME="284"></A>if we suppose the highest genus to be a principle.-But again, if unity 
<A NAME="285"></A>is more of the nature of a principle, and the indivisible is one, and everything 
<A NAME="286"></A>indivisible is so either in quantity or in species, and that which is so 
<A NAME="287"></A>in species is the prior, and genera are divisible into species for man 
<A NAME="288"></A>is not the genus of individual men), that which is predicated directly 
<A NAME="289"></A>of the individuals will have more unity.-Further, in the case of things 
<A NAME="290"></A>in which the distinction of prior and posterior is present, that which 
<A NAME="291"></A>is predicable of these things cannot be something apart from them (e.g. 
<A NAME="292"></A>if two is the first of numbers, there will not be a Number apart from the 
<A NAME="293"></A>kinds of numbers; and similarly there will not be a Figure apart from the 
<A NAME="294"></A>kinds of figures; and if the genera of these things do not exist apart 
<A NAME="295"></A>from the species, the genera of other things will scarcely do so; for genera 
<A NAME="296"></A>of these things are thought to exist if any do). But among the individuals 
<A NAME="297"></A>one is not prior and another posterior. Further, where one thing is better 
<A NAME="298"></A>and another worse, the better is always prior; so that of these also no 
<A NAME="299"></A>genus can exist. From these considerations, then, the species predicated 
<A NAME="300"></A>of individuals seem to be principles rather than the genera. But again, 
<A NAME="301"></A>it is not easy to say in what sense these are to be taken as principles. 
<A NAME="302"></A>For the principle or cause must exist alongside of the things of which 
<A NAME="303"></A>it is the principle, and must be capable of existing in separation from 
<A NAME="304"></A>them; but for what reason should we suppose any such thing to exist alongside 
<A NAME="305"></A>of the individual, except that it is predicated universally and of all? 
<A NAME="306"></A>But if this is the reason, the things that are more universal must be supposed 
<A NAME="307"></A>to be more of the nature of principles; so that the highest genera would 
<A NAME="308"></A>be the principles.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="309"></A><B>Part 4</B>
<A NAME="310"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>"(8) There is a difficulty connected with these, the hardest of 
<A NAME="312"></A>all and the most necessary to examine, and of this the discussion now awaits 
<A NAME="313"></A>us. If, on the one hand, there is nothing apart from individual things, 
<A NAME="314"></A>and the individuals are infinite in number, how then is it possible to 
<A NAME="315"></A>get knowledge of the infinite individuals? For all things that we come 
<A NAME="316"></A>to know, we come to know in so far as they have some unity and identity, 
<A NAME="317"></A>and in so far as some attribute belongs to them universally. <BR><BR>"But 
<A NAME="318"></A>if this is necessary, and there must be something apart from the individuals, 
<A NAME="319"></A>it will be necessary that the genera exist apart from the individuals, 
<A NAME="320"></A>either the lowest or the highest genera; but we found by discussion just 
<A NAME="321"></A>now that this is impossible. <BR><BR>"Further, if we admit in the fullest 
<A NAME="322"></A>sense that something exists apart from the concrete thing, whenever something 
<A NAME="323"></A>is predicated of the matter, must there, if there is something apart, be 
<A NAME="324"></A>something apart from each set of individuals, or from some and not from 
<A NAME="325"></A>others, or from none? (A) If there is nothing apart from individuals, there 
<A NAME="326"></A>will be no object of thought, but all things will be objects of sense, 
<A NAME="327"></A>and there will not be knowledge of anything, unless we say that sensation 
<A NAME="328"></A>is knowledge. Further, nothing will be eternal or unmovable; for all perceptible 
<A NAME="329"></A>things perish and are in movement. But if there is nothing eternal, neither 
<A NAME="330"></A>can there be a process of coming to be; for there must be something that 
<A NAME="331"></A>comes to be, i.e. from which something comes to be, and the ultimate term 
<A NAME="332"></A>in this series cannot have come to be, since the series has a limit and 
<A NAME="333"></A>since nothing can come to be out of that which is not. Further, if generation 
<A NAME="334"></A>and movement exist there must also be a limit; for no movement is infinite, 
<A NAME="335"></A>but every movement has an end, and that which is incapable of completing 
<A NAME="336"></A>its coming to be cannot be in process of coming to be; and that which has 
<A NAME="337"></A>completed its coming to be must he as soon as it has come to be. Further, 
<A NAME="338"></A>since the matter exists, because it is ungenerated, it is a fortiori reasonable 
<A NAME="339"></A>that the substance or essence, that which the matter is at any time coming 
<A NAME="340"></A>to be, should exist; for if neither essence nor matter is to be, nothing 
<A NAME="341"></A>will be at all, and since this is impossible there must be something besides 
<A NAME="342"></A>the concrete thing, viz. the shape or form. <BR><BR>"But again (B) if we 
<A NAME="343"></A>are to suppose this, it is hard to say in which cases we are to suppose 
<A NAME="344"></A>it and in which not. For evidently it is not possible to suppose it in 
<A NAME="345"></A>all cases; we could not suppose that there is a house besides the particular 
<A NAME="346"></A>houses.-Besides this, will the substance of all the individuals, e.g. of 
<A NAME="347"></A>all men, be one? This is paradoxical, for all the things whose substance 
<A NAME="348"></A>is one are one. But are the substances many and different? This also is 
<A NAME="349"></A>unreasonable.-At the same time, how does the matter become each of the 
<A NAME="350"></A>individuals, and how is the concrete thing these two elements? <BR><BR>"(9) 
<A NAME="351"></A>Again, one might ask the following question also about the first principles. 
<A NAME="352"></A>If they are one in kind only, nothing will be numerically one, not even 
<A NAME="353"></A>unity-itself and being-itself; and how will knowing exist, if there is 
<A NAME="354"></A>not to be something common to a whole set of individuals? <BR><BR>"But 
<A NAME="355"></A>if there is a common element which is numerically one, and each of the 
<A NAME="356"></A>principles is one, and the principles are not as in the case of perceptible 
<A NAME="357"></A>things different for different things (e.g. since this particular syllable 
<A NAME="358"></A>is the same in kind whenever it occurs, the elements it are also the same 
<A NAME="359"></A>in kind; only in kind, for these also, like the syllable, are numerically 
<A NAME="360"></A>different in different contexts),-if it is not like this but the principles 
<A NAME="361"></A>of things are numerically one, there will be nothing else besides the elements 
<A NAME="362"></A>(for there is no difference of meaning between 'numerically one' and 'individual'; 
<A NAME="363"></A>for this is just what we mean by the individual-the numerically one, and 
<A NAME="364"></A>by the universal we mean that which is predicable of the individuals). 
<A NAME="365"></A>Therefore it will be just as if the elements of articulate sound were limited 
<A NAME="366"></A>in number; all the language in the world would be confined to the ABC, 
<A NAME="367"></A>since there could not be two or more letters of the same kind. <BR><BR>"(10) 
<A NAME="368"></A>One difficulty which is as great as any has been neglected both by modern 
<A NAME="369"></A>philosophers and by their predecessors-whether the principles of perishable 
<A NAME="370"></A>and those of imperishable things are the same or different. If they are 
<A NAME="371"></A>the same, how are some things perishable and others imperishable, and for 
<A NAME="372"></A>what reason? The school of Hesiod and all the theologians thought only 
<A NAME="373"></A>of what was plausible to themselves, and had no regard to us. For, asserting 
<A NAME="374"></A>the first principles to be gods and born of gods, they say that the beings 
<A NAME="375"></A>which did not taste of nectar and ambrosia became mortal; and clearly they 
<A NAME="376"></A>are using words which are familiar to themselves, yet what they have said 
<A NAME="377"></A>about the very application of these causes is above our comprehension. 
<A NAME="378"></A>For if the gods taste of nectar and ambrosia for their pleasure, these 
<A NAME="379"></A>are in no wise the causes of their existence; and if they taste them to 
<A NAME="380"></A>maintain their existence, how can gods who need food be eternal?-But into 
<A NAME="381"></A>the subtleties of the mythologists it is not worth our while to inquire 
<A NAME="382"></A>seriously; those, however, who use the language of proof we must cross-examine 
<A NAME="383"></A>and ask why, after all, things which consist of the same elements are, 
<A NAME="384"></A>some of them, eternal in nature, while others perish. Since these philosophers 
<A NAME="385"></A>mention no cause, and it is unreasonable that things should be as they 
<A NAME="386"></A>say, evidently the principles or causes of things cannot be the same. Even 
<A NAME="387"></A>the man whom one might suppose to speak most consistently-Empedocles, even 
<A NAME="388"></A>he has made the same mistake; for he maintains that strife is a principle 
<A NAME="389"></A>that causes destruction, but even strife would seem no less to produce 
<A NAME="390"></A>everything, except the One; for all things excepting God proceed from strife. 
<A NAME="391"></A>At least he says:- "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>"From which all that was and is and will be hereafter- <BR><BR>"Trees, 
<A NAME="393"></A>and men and women, took their growth, <BR><BR>"And beasts and birds and 
<A NAME="394"></A>water-nourished fish, <BR><BR>"And long-aged gods. "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>"The implication is evident even apart from these words; for if 
<A NAME="396"></A>strife had not been present in things, all things would have been one, 
<A NAME="397"></A>according to him; for when they have come together, 'then strife stood 
<A NAME="398"></A>outermost.' Hence it also follows on his theory that God most blessed is 
<A NAME="399"></A>less wise than all others; for he does not know all the elements; for he 
<A NAME="400"></A>has in him no strife, and knowledge is of the like by the like. 'For by 
<A NAME="401"></A>earth,' he says, "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>"we see earth, by water water, <BR><BR>"By ether godlike ether, 
<A NAME="403"></A>by fire wasting fire, <BR><BR>"Love by love, and strife by gloomy strife. 
<A NAME="404"></A>"<BR><BR>

<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>But-and this is the point we started from this at least is evident, 
<A NAME="406"></A>that on his theory it follows that strife is as much the cause of existence 
<A NAME="407"></A>as of destruction. And similarly love is not specially the cause of existence; 
<A NAME="408"></A>for in collecting things into the One it destroys all other things. And 
<A NAME="409"></A>at the same time Empedocles mentions no cause of the change itself, except 
<A NAME="410"></A>that things are so by nature. <BR><BR>"But when strife at last waxed great 
<A NAME="411"></A>in the limbs of the <BR><BR>"Sphere, <BR><BR>"And sprang to assert its 
<A NAME="412"></A>rights as the time was fulfilled <BR><BR>"Which is fixed for them in turn 
<A NAME="413"></A>by a mighty oath. "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>"This implies that change was necessary; but he shows no cause 
<A NAME="415"></A>of the necessity. But yet so far at least he alone speaks consistently; 
<A NAME="416"></A>for he does not make some things perishable and others imperishable, but 
<A NAME="417"></A>makes all perishable except the elements. The difficulty we are speaking 
<A NAME="418"></A>of now is, why some things are perishable and others are not, if they consist 
<A NAME="419"></A>of the same principles. <BR><BR>"Let this suffice as proof of the fact 
<A NAME="420"></A>that the principles cannot be the same. But if there are different principles, 
<A NAME="421"></A>one difficulty is whether these also will be imperishable or perishable. 
<A NAME="422"></A>For if they are perishable, evidently these also must consist of certain 
<A NAME="423"></A>elements (for all things that perish, perish by being resolved into the 
<A NAME="424"></A>elements of which they consist); so that it follows that prior to the principles 
<A NAME="425"></A>there are other principles. But this is impossible, whether the process 
<A NAME="426"></A>has a limit or proceeds to infinity. Further, how will perishable things 
<A NAME="427"></A>exist, if their principles are to be annulled? But if the principles are 
<A NAME="428"></A>imperishable, why will things composed of some imperishable principles 
<A NAME="429"></A>be perishable, while those composed of the others are imperishable? This 
<A NAME="430"></A>is not probable, but is either impossible or needs much proof. Further, 
<A NAME="431"></A>no one has even tried to maintain different principles; they maintain the 
<A NAME="432"></A>same principles for all things. But they swallow the difficulty we stated 
<A NAME="433"></A>first as if they took it to be something trifling. <BR><BR>"(11) The inquiry 
<A NAME="434"></A>that is both the hardest of all and the most necessary for knowledge of 
<A NAME="435"></A>the truth is whether being and unity are the substances of things, and 
<A NAME="436"></A>whether each of them, without being anything else, is being or unity respectively, 
<A NAME="437"></A>or we must inquire what being and unity are, with the implication that 
<A NAME="438"></A>they have some other underlying nature. For some people think they are 
<A NAME="439"></A>of the former, others think they are of the latter character. Plato and 
<A NAME="440"></A>the Pythagoreans thought being and unity were nothing else, but this was 
<A NAME="441"></A>their nature, their essence being just unity and being. But the natural 
<A NAME="442"></A>philosophers take a different line; e.g. Empedocles-as though reducing 
<A NAME="443"></A>to something more intelligible-says what unity is; for he would seem to 
<A NAME="444"></A>say it is love: at least, this is for all things the cause of their being 
<A NAME="445"></A>one. Others say this unity and being, of which things consist and have 
<A NAME="446"></A>been made, is fire, and others say it is air. A similar view is expressed 
<A NAME="447"></A>by those who make the elements more than one; for these also must say that 
<A NAME="448"></A>unity and being are precisely all the things which they say are principles. 
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR>"(A) If we do not suppose unity and being to be substances, it 
<A NAME="450"></A>follows that none of the other universals is a substance; for these are 
<A NAME="451"></A>most universal of all, and if there is no unity itself or being-itself, 
<A NAME="452"></A>there will scarcely be in any other case anything apart from what are called 
<A NAME="453"></A>the individuals. Further, if unity is not a substance, evidently number 
<A NAME="454"></A>also will not exist as an entity separate from the individual things; for 
<A NAME="455"></A>number is units, and the unit is precisely a certain kind of one. <BR><BR>"But 
<A NAME="456"></A>(B) if there is a unity-itself and a being itself, unity and being must 
<A NAME="457"></A>be their substance; for it is not something else that is predicated universally 
<A NAME="458"></A>of the things that are and are one, but just unity and being. But if there 
<A NAME="459"></A>is to be a being-itself and a unity-itself, there is much difficulty in 
<A NAME="460"></A>seeing how there will be anything else besides these,-I mean, how things 
<A NAME="461"></A>will be more than one in number. For what is different from being does 
<A NAME="462"></A>not exist, so that it necessarily follows, according to the argument of 
<A NAME="463"></A>Parmenides, that all things that are are one and this is being. <BR><BR>"There 
<A NAME="464"></A>are objections to both views. For whether unity is not a substance or there 
<A NAME="465"></A>is a unity-itself, number cannot be a substance. We have already said why 
<A NAME="466"></A>this result follows if unity is not a substance; and if it is, the same 
<A NAME="467"></A>difficulty arises as arose with regard to being. For whence is there to 
<A NAME="468"></A>be another one besides unity-itself? It must be not-one; but all things 
<A NAME="469"></A>are either one or many, and of the many each is one. <BR><BR>"Further, 
<A NAME="470"></A>if unity-itself is indivisible, according to Zeno's postulate it will be 
<A NAME="471"></A>nothing. For that which neither when added makes a thing greater nor when 
<A NAME="472"></A>subtracted makes it less, he asserts to have no being, evidently assuming 
<A NAME="473"></A>that whatever has being is a spatial magnitude. And if it is a magnitude, 
<A NAME="474"></A>it is corporeal; for the corporeal has being in every dimension, while 
<A NAME="475"></A>the other objects of mathematics, e.g. a plane or a line, added in one 
<A NAME="476"></A>way will increase what they are added to, but in another way will not do 
<A NAME="477"></A>so, and a point or a unit does so in no way. But, since his theory is of 
<A NAME="478"></A>a low order, and an indivisible thing can exist in such a way as to have 
<A NAME="479"></A>a defence even against him (for the indivisible when added will make the 
<A NAME="480"></A>number, though not the size, greater),-yet how can a magnitude proceed 
<A NAME="481"></A>from one such indivisible or from many? It is like saying that the line 
<A NAME="482"></A>is made out of points. <BR><BR>"But even if ore supposes the case to be 
<A NAME="483"></A>such that, as some say, number proceeds from unity-itself and something 
<A NAME="484"></A>else which is not one, none the less we must inquire why and how the product 
<A NAME="485"></A>will be sometimes a number and sometimes a magnitude, if the not-one was 
<A NAME="486"></A>inequality and was the same principle in either case. For it is not evident 
<A NAME="487"></A>how magnitudes could proceed either from the one and this principle, or 
<A NAME="488"></A>from some number and this principle.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="489"></A><B>Part 5</B>
<A NAME="490"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>"(14) A question connected with these is whether numbers and bodies 
<A NAME="492"></A>and planes and points are substances of a kind, or not. If they are not, 
<A NAME="493"></A>it baffles us to say what being is and what the substances of things are. 
<A NAME="494"></A>For modifications and movements and relations and dispositions and ratios 
<A NAME="495"></A>do not seem to indicate the substance of anything; for all are predicated 
<A NAME="496"></A>of a subject, and none is a 'this'. And as to the things which might seem 
<A NAME="497"></A>most of all to indicate substance, water and earth and fire and air, of 
<A NAME="498"></A>which composite bodies consist, heat and cold and the like are modifications 
<A NAME="499"></A>of these, not substances, and the body which is thus modified alone persists 
<A NAME="500"></A>as something real and as a substance. But, on the other hand, the body 
<A NAME="501"></A>is surely less of a substance than the surface, and the surface than the 
<A NAME="502"></A>line, and the line than the unit and the point. For the body is bounded 
<A NAME="503"></A>by these; and they are thought to be capable of existing without body, 
<A NAME="504"></A>but body incapable of existing without these. This is why, while most of 
<A NAME="505"></A>the philosophers and the earlier among them thought that substance and 
<A NAME="506"></A>being were identical with body, and that all other things were modifications 
<A NAME="507"></A>of this, so that the first principles of the bodies were the first principles 
<A NAME="508"></A>of being, the more recent and those who were held to be wiser thought numbers 
<A NAME="509"></A>were the first principles. As we said, then, if these are not substance, 
<A NAME="510"></A>there is no substance and no being at all; for the accidents of these it 
<A NAME="511"></A>cannot be right to call beings. <BR><BR>"But if this is admitted, that 
<A NAME="512"></A>lines and points are substance more than bodies, but we do not see to what 
<A NAME="513"></A>sort of bodies these could belong (for they cannot be in perceptible bodies), 
<A NAME="514"></A>there can be no substance.-Further, these are all evidently divisions of 
<A NAME="515"></A>body,-one in breadth, another in depth, another in length. Besides this, 
<A NAME="516"></A>no sort of shape is present in the solid more than any other; so that if 
<A NAME="517"></A>the Hermes is not in the stone, neither is the half of the cube in the 
<A NAME="518"></A>cube as something determinate; therefore the surface is not in it either; 
<A NAME="519"></A>for if any sort of surface were in it, the surface which marks off the 
<A NAME="520"></A>half of the cube would be in it too. And the same account applies to the 
<A NAME="521"></A>line and to the point and the unit. Therefore, if on the one hand body 
<A NAME="522"></A>is in the highest degree substance, and on the other hand these things 
<A NAME="523"></A>are so more than body, but these are not even instances of substance, it 
<A NAME="524"></A>baffles us to say what being is and what the substance of things is.-For 
<A NAME="525"></A>besides what has been said, the questions of generation and instruction 
<A NAME="526"></A>confront us with further paradoxes. For if substance, not having existed 
<A NAME="527"></A>before, now exists, or having existed before, afterwards does not exist, 
<A NAME="528"></A>this change is thought to be accompanied by a process of becoming or perishing; 
<A NAME="529"></A>but points and lines and surfaces cannot be in process either of becoming 
<A NAME="530"></A>or of perishing, when they at one time exist and at another do not. For 
<A NAME="531"></A>when bodies come into contact or are divided, their boundaries simultaneously 
<A NAME="532"></A>become one in the one case when they touch, and two in the other-when they 
<A NAME="533"></A>are divided; so that when they have been put together one boundary does 
<A NAME="534"></A>not exist but has perished, and when they have been divided the boundaries 
<A NAME="535"></A>exist which before did not exist (for it cannot be said that the point, 
<A NAME="536"></A>which is indivisible, was divided into two). And if the boundaries come 
<A NAME="537"></A>into being and cease to be, from what do they come into being? A similar 
<A NAME="538"></A>account may also be given of the 'now' in time; for this also cannot be 
<A NAME="539"></A>in process of coming into being or of ceasing to be, but yet seems to be 
<A NAME="540"></A>always different, which shows that it is not a substance. And evidently 
<A NAME="541"></A>the same is true of points and lines and planes; for the same argument 
<A NAME="542"></A>applies, since they are all alike either limits or divisions.

<A NAME="544"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>"In general one might raise the question why after all, besides 
<A NAME="546"></A>perceptible things and the intermediates, we have to look for another class 
<A NAME="547"></A>of things, i.e. the Forms which we posit. If it is for this reason, because 
<A NAME="548"></A>the objects of mathematics, while they differ from the things in this world 
<A NAME="549"></A>in some other respect, differ not at all in that there are many of the 
<A NAME="550"></A>same kind, so that their first principles cannot be limited in number (just 
<A NAME="551"></A>as the elements of all the language in this sensible world are not limited 
<A NAME="552"></A>in number, but in kind, unless one takes the elements of this individual 
<A NAME="553"></A>syllable or of this individual articulate sound-whose elements will be 
<A NAME="554"></A>limited even in number; so is it also in the case of the intermediates; 
<A NAME="555"></A>for there also the members of the same kind are infinite in number), so 
<A NAME="556"></A>that if there are not-besides perceptible and mathematical objects-others 
<A NAME="557"></A>such as some maintain the Forms to be, there will be no substance which 
<A NAME="558"></A>is one in number, but only in kind, nor will the first principles of things 
<A NAME="559"></A>be determinate in number, but only in kind:-if then this must be so, the 
<A NAME="560"></A>Forms also must therefore be held to exist. Even if those who support this 
<A NAME="561"></A>view do not express it articulately, still this is what they mean, and 
<A NAME="562"></A>they must be maintaining the Forms just because each of the Forms is a 
<A NAME="563"></A>substance and none is by accident. <BR><BR>"But if we are to suppose both 
<A NAME="564"></A>that the Forms exist and that the principles are one in number, not in 
<A NAME="565"></A>kind, we have mentioned the impossible results that necessarily follow. 
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>"(13) Closely connected with this is the question whether the elements 
<A NAME="567"></A>exist potentially or in some other manner. If in some other way, there 
<A NAME="568"></A>will be something else prior to the first principles; for the potency is 
<A NAME="569"></A>prior to the actual cause, and it is not necessary for everything potential 
<A NAME="570"></A>to be actual.-But if the elements exist potentially, it is possible that 
<A NAME="571"></A>everything that is should not be. For even that which is not yet is capable 
<A NAME="572"></A>of being; for that which is not comes to be, but nothing that is incapable 
<A NAME="573"></A>of being comes to be. <BR><BR>"(12) We must not only raise these questions 
<A NAME="574"></A>about the first principles, but also ask whether they are universal or 
<A NAME="575"></A>what we call individuals. If they are universal, they will not be substances; 
<A NAME="576"></A>for everything that is common indicates not a 'this' but a 'such', but 
<A NAME="577"></A>substance is a 'this'. And if we are to be allowed to lay it down that 
<A NAME="578"></A>a common predicate is a 'this' and a single thing, Socrates will be several 
<A NAME="579"></A>animals-himself and 'man' and 'animal', if each of these indicates a 'this' 
<A NAME="580"></A>and a single thing. <BR><BR>"If, then, the principles are universals, these 
<A NAME="581"></A>universal. Therefore if there is to be results follow; if they are not 
<A NAME="582"></A>universals but of knowledge of the principles there must be the nature 
<A NAME="583"></A>of individuals, they will not be other principles prior to them, namely 
<A NAME="584"></A>those knowable; for the knowledge of anything is that are universally predicated 
<A NAME="585"></A>of them.
