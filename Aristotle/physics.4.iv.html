<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>The physicist must have a knowledge of Place, too, as well as of the infinite-namely, 
<A NAME="12"></A>whether there is such a thing or not, and the manner of its existence and 
<A NAME="13"></A>what it is-both because all suppose that things which exist are somewhere 
<A NAME="14"></A>(the non-existent is nowhere--where is the goat-stag or the sphinx?), and 
<A NAME="15"></A>because 'motion' in its most general and primary sense is change of place, 
<A NAME="16"></A>which we call 'locomotion'.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>The question, what is place? presents many difficulties. An examination 
<A NAME="18"></A>of all the relevant facts seems to lead to divergent conclusions. Moreover, 
<A NAME="19"></A>we have inherited nothing from previous thinkers, whether in the way of 
<A NAME="20"></A>a statement of difficulties or of a solution.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>The existence of place is held to be obvious from the fact of mutual 
<A NAME="22"></A>replacement. Where water now is, there in turn, when the water has gone 
<A NAME="23"></A>out as from a vessel, air is present. When therefore another body occupies 
<A NAME="24"></A>this same place, the place is thought to be different from all the bodies 
<A NAME="25"></A>which come to be in it and replace one another. What now contains air formerly 
<A NAME="26"></A>contained water, so that clearly the place or space into which and out 
<A NAME="27"></A>of which they passed was something different from both.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>Further, the typical locomotions of the elementary natural bodies-namely, 
<A NAME="29"></A>fire, earth, and the like-show not only that place is something, but also 
<A NAME="30"></A>that it exerts a certain influence. Each is carried to its own place, if 
<A NAME="31"></A>it is not hindered, the one up, the other down. Now these are regions or 
<A NAME="32"></A>kinds of place-up and down and the rest of the six directions. Nor do such 
<A NAME="33"></A>distinctions (up and down and right and left, &c.) hold only in relation 
<A NAME="34"></A>to us. To us they are not always the same but change with the direction 
<A NAME="35"></A>in which we are turned: that is why the same thing may be both right and 
<A NAME="36"></A>left, up and down, before and behind. But in nature each is distinct, taken 
<A NAME="37"></A>apart by itself. It is not every chance direction which is 'up', but where 
<A NAME="38"></A>fire and what is light are carried; similarly, too, 'down' is not any chance 
<A NAME="39"></A>direction but where what has weight and what is made of earth are carried-the 
<A NAME="40"></A>implication being that these places do not differ merely in relative position, 
<A NAME="41"></A>but also as possessing distinct potencies. This is made plain also by the 
<A NAME="42"></A>objects studied by mathematics. Though they have no real place, they nevertheless, 
<A NAME="43"></A>in respect of their position relatively to us, have a right and left as 
<A NAME="44"></A>attributes ascribed to them only in consequence of their relative position, 
<A NAME="45"></A>not having by nature these various characteristics. Again, the theory that 
<A NAME="46"></A>the void exists involves the existence of place: for one would define void 
<A NAME="47"></A>as place bereft of body.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>These considerations then would lead us to suppose that place is 
<A NAME="49"></A>something distinct from bodies, and that every sensible body is in place. 
<A NAME="50"></A>Hesiod too might be held to have given a correct account of it when he 
<A NAME="51"></A>made chaos first. At least he says:
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>'First of all things came chaos to being, then broad-breasted earth,' 
<A NAME="53"></A>implying that things need to have space first, because he thought, with 
<A NAME="54"></A>most people, that everything is somewhere and in place. If this is its 
<A NAME="55"></A>nature, the potency of place must be a marvellous thing, and take precedence 
<A NAME="56"></A>of all other things. For that without which nothing else can exist, while 
<A NAME="57"></A>it can exist without the others, must needs be first; for place does not 
<A NAME="58"></A>pass out of existence when the things in it are annihilated.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>True, but even if we suppose its existence settled, the question 
<A NAME="60"></A>of its nature presents difficulty-whether it is some sort of 'bulk' of 
<A NAME="61"></A>body or some entity other than that, for we must first determine its 
<A NAME="62"></A>genus.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>(1) Now it has three dimensions, length, breadth, depth, the dimensions 
<A NAME="64"></A>by which all body also is bounded. But the place cannot be body; for if 
<A NAME="65"></A>it were there would be two bodies in the same place.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>(2) Further, if body has a place and space, clearly so too have 
<A NAME="67"></A>surface and the other limits of body; for the same statement will apply 
<A NAME="68"></A>to them: where the bounding planes of the water were, there in turn will 
<A NAME="69"></A>be those of the air. But when we come to a point we cannot make a distinction 
<A NAME="70"></A>between it and its place. Hence if the place of a point is not different 
<A NAME="71"></A>from the point, no more will that of any of the others be different, and 
<A NAME="72"></A>place will not be something different from each of them.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>(3) What in the world then are we to suppose place to be? If it 
<A NAME="74"></A>has the sort of nature described, it cannot be an element or composed of 
<A NAME="75"></A>elements, whether these be corporeal or incorporeal: for while it has size, 
<A NAME="76"></A>it has not body. But the elements of sensible bodies are bodies, while 
<A NAME="77"></A>nothing that has size results from a combination of intelligible 
<A NAME="78"></A>elements.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>(4) Also we may ask: of what in things is space the cause? None 
<A NAME="80"></A>of the four modes of causation can be ascribed to it. It is neither in 
<A NAME="81"></A>the sense of the matter of existents (for nothing is composed of it), nor 
<A NAME="82"></A>as the form and definition of things, nor as end, nor does it move 
<A NAME="83"></A>existents.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>(5) Further, too, if it is itself an existent, where will it be? 
<A NAME="85"></A>Zeno's difficulty demands an explanation: for if everything that exists 
<A NAME="86"></A>has a place, place too will have a place, and so on ad 
<A NAME="87"></A>infinitum.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>(6) Again, just as every body is in place, so, too, every place 
<A NAME="89"></A>has a body in it. What then shall we say about growing things? It follows 
<A NAME="90"></A>from these premisses that their place must grow with them, if their place 
<A NAME="91"></A>is neither less nor greater than they are.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>By asking these questions, then, we must raise the whole problem 
<A NAME="93"></A>about place-not only as to what it is, but even whether there is such a 
<A NAME="94"></A>thing.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="95"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>We may distinguish generally between predicating B of A because 
<A NAME="97"></A>it (A) is itself, and because it is something else; and particularly between 
<A NAME="98"></A>place which is common and in which all bodies are, and the special place 
<A NAME="99"></A>occupied primarily by each. I mean, for instance, that you are now in the 
<A NAME="100"></A>heavens because you are in the air and it is in the heavens; and you are 
<A NAME="101"></A>in the air because you are on the earth; and similarly on the earth because 
<A NAME="102"></A>you are in this place which contains no more than you.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>Now if place is what primarily contains each body, it would be 
<A NAME="104"></A>a limit, so that the place would be the form or shape of each body by which 
<A NAME="105"></A>the magnitude or the matter of the magnitude is defined: for this is the 
<A NAME="106"></A>limit of each body.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>If, then, we look at the question in this way the place of a thing 
<A NAME="108"></A>is its form. But, if we regard the place as the extension of the magnitude, 
<A NAME="109"></A>it is the matter. For this is different from the magnitude: it is what 
<A NAME="110"></A>is contained and defined by the form, as by a bounding plane. Matter or 
<A NAME="111"></A>the indeterminate is of this nature; when the boundary and attributes of 
<A NAME="112"></A>a sphere are taken away, nothing but the matter is left.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>This is why Plato in the Timaeus says that matter and space are 
<A NAME="114"></A>the same; for the 'participant' and space are identical. (It is true, indeed, 
<A NAME="115"></A>that the account he gives there of the 'participant' is different from 
<A NAME="116"></A>what he says in his so-called 'unwritten teaching'. Nevertheless, he did 
<A NAME="117"></A>identify place and space.) I mention Plato because, while all hold place 
<A NAME="118"></A>to be something, he alone tried to say what it is.
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>In view of these facts we should naturally expect to find difficulty 
<A NAME="120"></A>in determining what place is, if indeed it is one of these two things, 
<A NAME="121"></A>matter or form. They demand a very close scrutiny, especially as it is 
<A NAME="122"></A>not easy to recognize them apart.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>But it is at any rate not difficult to see that place cannot be 
<A NAME="124"></A>either of them. The form and the matter are not separate from the thing, 
<A NAME="125"></A>whereas the place can be separated. As we pointed out, where air was, water 
<A NAME="126"></A>in turn comes to be, the one replacing the other; and similarly with other 
<A NAME="127"></A>bodies. Hence the place of a thing is neither a part nor a state of it, 
<A NAME="128"></A>but is separable from it. For place is supposed to be something like a 
<A NAME="129"></A>vessel-the vessel being a transportable place. But the vessel is no part 
<A NAME="130"></A>of the thing.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>In so far then as it is separable from the thing, it is not the 
<A NAME="132"></A>form: qua containing, it is different from the matter.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>Also it is held that what is anywhere is both itself something 
<A NAME="134"></A>and that there is a different thing outside it. (Plato of course, if we 
<A NAME="135"></A>may digress, ought to tell us why the form and the numbers are not in place, 
<A NAME="136"></A>if 'what participates' is place-whether what participates is the Great 
<A NAME="137"></A>and the Small or the matter, as he called it in writing in the 
<A NAME="138"></A>Timaeus.)
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>Further, how could a body be carried to its own place, if place 
<A NAME="140"></A>was the matter or the form? It is impossible that what has no reference 
<A NAME="141"></A>to motion or the distinction of up and down can be place. So place must 
<A NAME="142"></A>be looked for among things which have these characteristics.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>If the place is in the thing (it must be if it is either shape 
<A NAME="144"></A>or matter) place will have a place: for both the form and the indeterminate 
<A NAME="145"></A>undergo change and motion along with the thing, and are not always in the 
<A NAME="146"></A>same place, but are where the thing is. Hence the place will have a 
<A NAME="147"></A>place.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>Further, when water is produced from air, the place has been destroyed, 
<A NAME="149"></A>for the resulting body is not in the same place. What sort of destruction 
<A NAME="150"></A>then is that?
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>This concludes my statement of the reasons why space must be something, 
<A NAME="152"></A>and again of the difficulties that may be raised about its essential 
<A NAME="153"></A>nature.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="154"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>The next step we must take is to see in how many senses one thing 
<A NAME="156"></A>is said to be 'in' another.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>(1) As the finger is 'in' the hand and generally the part 'in' 
<A NAME="158"></A>the whole.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>(2) As the whole is 'in' the parts: for there is no whole over 
<A NAME="160"></A>and above the parts.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>(3) As man is 'in' animal and generally species 'in' 
<A NAME="162"></A>genus.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR>(4) As the genus is 'in' the species and generally the part of the 
<A NAME="164"></A>specific form 'in' the definition of the specific form.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>(5) As health is 'in' the hot and the cold and generally the form 
<A NAME="166"></A>'in' the matter.
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>(6) As the affairs of Greece centre 'in' the king, and generally 
<A NAME="168"></A>events centre 'in' their primary motive agent.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>(7) As the existence of a thing centres 'in its good and generally 
<A NAME="170"></A>'in' its end, i.e. in 'that for the sake of which' it 
<A NAME="171"></A>exists.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>(8) In the strictest sense of all, as a thing is 'in' a vessel, 
<A NAME="173"></A>and generally 'in' place.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>One might raise the question whether a thing can be in itself, 
<A NAME="175"></A>or whether nothing can be in itself-everything being either nowhere or 
<A NAME="176"></A>in something else.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>The question is ambiguous; we may mean the thing qua itself or 
<A NAME="178"></A>qua something else.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>When there are parts of a whole-the one that in which a thing is, 
<A NAME="180"></A>the other the thing which is in it-the whole will be described as being 
<A NAME="181"></A>in itself. For a thing is described in terms of its parts, as well as in 
<A NAME="182"></A>terms of the thing as a whole, e.g. a man is said to be white because the 
<A NAME="183"></A>visible surface of him is white, or to be scientific because his thinking 
<A NAME="184"></A>faculty has been trained. The jar then will not be in itself and the wine 
<A NAME="185"></A>will not be in itself. But the jar of wine will: for the contents and the 
<A NAME="186"></A>container are both parts of the same whole.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>In this sense then, but not primarily, a thing can be in itself, 
<A NAME="188"></A>namely, as 'white' is in body (for the visible surface is in body), and 
<A NAME="189"></A>science is in the mind.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>It is from these, which are 'parts' (in the sense at least of being 
<A NAME="191"></A>'in' the man), that the man is called white, &c. But the jar and the wine 
<A NAME="192"></A>in separation are not parts of a whole, though together they are. So when 
<A NAME="193"></A>there are parts, a thing will be in itself, as 'white' is in man because 
<A NAME="194"></A>it is in body, and in body because it resides in the visible surface. We 
<A NAME="195"></A>cannot go further and say that it is in surface in virtue of something 
<A NAME="196"></A>other than itself. (Yet it is not in itself: though these are in a way 
<A NAME="197"></A>the same thing,) they differ in essence, each having a special nature and 
<A NAME="198"></A>capacity, 'surface' and 'white'.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>Thus if we look at the matter inductively we do not find anything 
<A NAME="200"></A>to be 'in' itself in any of the senses that have been distinguished; and 
<A NAME="201"></A>it can be seen by argument that it is impossible. For each of two things 
<A NAME="202"></A>will have to be both, e.g. the jar will have to be both vessel and wine, 
<A NAME="203"></A>and the wine both wine and jar, if it is possible for a thing to be in 
<A NAME="204"></A>itself; so that, however true it might be that they were in each other, 
<A NAME="205"></A>the jar will receive the wine in virtue not of its being wine but of the 
<A NAME="206"></A>wine's being wine, and the wine will be in the jar in virtue not of its 
<A NAME="207"></A>being a jar but of the jar's being a jar. Now that they are different in 
<A NAME="208"></A>respect of their essence is evident; for 'that in which something is' and 
<A NAME="209"></A>'that which is in it' would be differently defined.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>Nor is it possible for a thing to be in itself even incidentally: 
<A NAME="211"></A>for two things would at the same time in the same thing. The jar would 
<A NAME="212"></A>be in itself-if a thing whose nature it is to receive can be in itself; 
<A NAME="213"></A>and that which it receives, namely (if wine) wine, will be in 
<A NAME="214"></A>it.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>Obviously then a thing cannot be in itself primarily.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR>Zeno's problem-that if Place is something it must be in something-is 
<A NAME="217"></A>not difficult to solve. There is nothing to prevent the first place from 
<A NAME="218"></A>being 'in' something else-not indeed in that as 'in' place, but as health 
<A NAME="219"></A>is 'in' the hot as a positive determination of it or as the hot is 'in' 
<A NAME="220"></A>body as an affection. So we escape the infinite regress.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>Another thing is plain: since the vessel is no part of what is 
<A NAME="222"></A>in it (what contains in the strict sense is different from what is contained), 
<A NAME="223"></A>place could not be either the matter or the form of the thing contained, 
<A NAME="224"></A>but must different-for the latter, both the matter and the shape, are parts 
<A NAME="225"></A>of what is contained.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>This then may serve as a critical statement of the difficulties 
<A NAME="227"></A>involved.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="228"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>What then after all is place? The answer to this question may be 
<A NAME="230"></A>elucidated as follows.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>Let us take for granted about it the various characteristics which 
<A NAME="232"></A>are supposed correctly to belong to it essentially. We assume 
<A NAME="233"></A>then-
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>(1) Place is what contains that of which it is the 
<A NAME="235"></A>place.
<A NAME="236"></A><BR>(2) Place is no part of the thing.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR>(3) The immediate place of a thing is neither less nor greater than 
<A NAME="238"></A>the thing.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>(4) Place can be left behind by the thing and is separable. In 
<A NAME="240"></A>addition:
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>(5) All place admits of the distinction of up and down, and each 
<A NAME="242"></A>of the bodies is naturally carried to its appropriate place and rests there, 
<A NAME="243"></A>and this makes the place either up or down.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>Having laid these foundations, we must complete the theory. We 
<A NAME="245"></A>ought to try to make our investigation such as will render an account of 
<A NAME="246"></A>place, and will not only solve the difficulties connected with it, but 
<A NAME="247"></A>will also show that the attributes supposed to belong to it do really belong 
<A NAME="248"></A>to it, and further will make clear the cause of the trouble and of the 
<A NAME="249"></A>difficulties about it. Such is the most satisfactory kind of 
<A NAME="250"></A>exposition.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>First then we must understand that place would not have been thought 
<A NAME="252"></A>of, if there had not been a special kind of motion, namely that with respect 
<A NAME="253"></A>to place. It is chiefly for this reason that we suppose the heaven also 
<A NAME="254"></A>to be in place, because it is in constant movement. Of this kind of change 
<A NAME="255"></A>there are two species-locomotion on the one hand and, on the other, increase 
<A NAME="256"></A>and diminution. For these too involve variation of place: what was then 
<A NAME="257"></A>in this place has now in turn changed to what is larger or 
<A NAME="258"></A>smaller.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>Again, when we say a thing is 'moved', the predicate either (1) 
<A NAME="260"></A>belongs to it actually, in virtue of its own nature, or (2) in virtue of 
<A NAME="261"></A>something conjoined with it. In the latter case it may be either (a) something 
<A NAME="262"></A>which by its own nature is capable of being moved, e.g. the parts of the 
<A NAME="263"></A>body or the nail in the ship, or (b) something which is not in itself capable 
<A NAME="264"></A>of being moved, but is always moved through its conjunction with something 
<A NAME="265"></A>else, as 'whiteness' or 'science'. These have changed their place only 
<A NAME="266"></A>because the subjects to which they belong do so.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>We say that a thing is in the world, in the sense of in place, 
<A NAME="268"></A>because it is in the air, and the air is in the world; and when we say 
<A NAME="269"></A>it is in the air, we do not mean it is in every part of the air, but that 
<A NAME="270"></A>it is in the air because of the outer surface of the air which surrounds 
<A NAME="271"></A>it; for if all the air were its place, the place of a thing would not be 
<A NAME="272"></A>equal to the thing-which it is supposed to be, and which the primary place 
<A NAME="273"></A>in which a thing is actually is.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>When what surrounds, then, is not separate from the thing, but 
<A NAME="275"></A>is in continuity with it, the thing is said to be in what surrounds it, 
<A NAME="276"></A>not in the sense of in place, but as a part in a whole. But when the thing 
<A NAME="277"></A>is separate and in contact, it is immediately 'in' the inner surface of 
<A NAME="278"></A>the surrounding body, and this surface is neither a part of what is in 
<A NAME="279"></A>it nor yet greater than its extension, but equal to it; for the extremities 
<A NAME="280"></A>of things which touch are coincident.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>Further, if one body is in continuity with another, it is not moved 
<A NAME="282"></A>in that but with that. On the other hand it is moved in that if it is separate. 
<A NAME="283"></A>It makes no difference whether what contains is moved or 
<A NAME="284"></A>not.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>Again, when it is not separate it is described as a part in a whole, 
<A NAME="286"></A>as the pupil in the eye or the hand in the body: when it is separate, as 
<A NAME="287"></A>the water in the cask or the wine in the jar. For the hand is moved with 
<A NAME="288"></A>the body and the water in the cask.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>It will now be plain from these considerations what place is. There 
<A NAME="290"></A>are just four things of which place must be one-the shape, or the matter, 
<A NAME="291"></A>or some sort of extension between the bounding surfaces of the containing 
<A NAME="292"></A>body, or this boundary itself if it contains no extension over and above 
<A NAME="293"></A>the bulk of the body which comes to be in it.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>Three of these it obviously cannot be:
<A NAME="295"></A><BR>(1) The shape is supposed to be place because it surrounds, for the 
<A NAME="296"></A>extremities of what contains and of what is contained are coincident. Both 
<A NAME="297"></A>the shape and the place, it is true, are boundaries. But not of the same 
<A NAME="298"></A>thing: the form is the boundary of the thing, the place is the boundary 
<A NAME="299"></A>of the body which contains it.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>(2) The extension between the extremities is thought to be something, 
<A NAME="301"></A>because what is contained and separate may often be changed while the container 
<A NAME="302"></A>remains the same (as water may be poured from a vessel)-the assumption 
<A NAME="303"></A>being that the extension is something over and above the body displaced. 
<A NAME="304"></A>But there is no such extension. One of the bodies which change places and 
<A NAME="305"></A>are naturally capable of being in contact with the container falls in whichever 
<A NAME="306"></A>it may chance to be.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>If there were an extension which were such as to exist independently 
<A NAME="308"></A>and be permanent, there would be an infinity of places in the same thing. 
<A NAME="309"></A>For when the water and the air change places, all the portions of the two 
<A NAME="310"></A>together will play the same part in the whole which was previously played 
<A NAME="311"></A>by all the water in the vessel; at the same time the place too will be 
<A NAME="312"></A>undergoing change; so that there will be another place which is the place 
<A NAME="313"></A>of the place, and many places will be coincident. There is not a different 
<A NAME="314"></A>place of the part, in which it is moved, when the whole vessel changes 
<A NAME="315"></A>its place: it is always the same: for it is in the (proximate) place where 
<A NAME="316"></A>they are that the air and the water (or the parts of the water) succeed 
<A NAME="317"></A>each other, not in that place in which they come to be, which is part of 
<A NAME="318"></A>the place which is the place of the whole world.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>(3) The matter, too, might seem to be place, at least if we consider 
<A NAME="320"></A>it in what is at rest and is thus separate but in continuity. For just 
<A NAME="321"></A>as in change of quality there is something which was formerly black and 
<A NAME="322"></A>is now white, or formerly soft and now hard-this is just why we say that 
<A NAME="323"></A>the matter exists-so place, because it presents a similar phenomenon, is 
<A NAME="324"></A>thought to exist-only in the one case we say so because what was air is 
<A NAME="325"></A>now water, in the other because where air formerly was there a is now water. 
<A NAME="326"></A>But the matter, as we said before, is neither separable from the thing 
<A NAME="327"></A>nor contains it, whereas place has both characteristics.
<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>Well, then, if place is none of the three-neither the form nor 
<A NAME="329"></A>the matter nor an extension which is always there, different from, and 
<A NAME="330"></A>over and above, the extension of the thing which is displaced-place necessarily 
<A NAME="331"></A>is the one of the four which is left, namely, the boundary of the containing 
<A NAME="332"></A>body at which it is in contact with the contained body. (By the contained 
<A NAME="333"></A>body is meant what can be moved by way of locomotion.)
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>Place is thought to be something important and hard to grasp, both 
<A NAME="335"></A>because the matter and the shape present themselves along with it, and 
<A NAME="336"></A>because the displacement of the body that is moved takes place in a stationary 
<A NAME="337"></A>container, for it seems possible that there should be an interval which 
<A NAME="338"></A>is other than the bodies which are moved. The air, too, which is thought 
<A NAME="339"></A>to be incorporeal, contributes something to the belief: it is not only 
<A NAME="340"></A>the boundaries of the vessel which seem to be place, but also what is between 
<A NAME="341"></A>them, regarded as empty. Just, in fact, as the vessel is transportable 
<A NAME="342"></A>place, so place is a non-portable vessel. So when what is within a thing 
<A NAME="343"></A>which is moved, is moved and changes its place, as a boat on a river, what 
<A NAME="344"></A>contains plays the part of a vessel rather than that of place. Place on 
<A NAME="345"></A>the other hand is rather what is motionless: so it is rather the whole 
<A NAME="346"></A>river that is place, because as a whole it is motionless.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>Hence we conclude that the innermost motionless boundary of what 
<A NAME="348"></A>contains is place.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>This explains why the middle of the heaven and the surface which 
<A NAME="350"></A>faces us of the rotating system are held to be 'up' and 'down' in the strict 
<A NAME="351"></A>and fullest sense for all men: for the one is always at rest, while the 
<A NAME="352"></A>inner side of the rotating body remains always coincident with itself. 
<A NAME="353"></A>Hence since the light is what is naturally carried up, and the heavy what 
<A NAME="354"></A>is carried down, the boundary which contains in the direction of the middle 
<A NAME="355"></A>of the universe, and the middle itself, are down, and that which contains 
<A NAME="356"></A>in the direction of the outermost part of the universe, and the outermost 
<A NAME="357"></A>part itself, are up.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>For this reason, too, place is thought to be a kind of surface, 
<A NAME="359"></A>and as it were a vessel, i.e. a container of the thing.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>Further, place is coincident with the thing, for boundaries are 
<A NAME="361"></A>coincident with the bounded.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="362"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>If then a body has another body outside it and containing it, it 
<A NAME="364"></A>is in place, and if not, not. That is why, even if there were to be water 
<A NAME="365"></A>which had not a container, the parts of it, on the one hand, will be moved 
<A NAME="366"></A>(for one part is contained in another), while, on the other hand, the whole 
<A NAME="367"></A>will be moved in one sense, but not in another. For as a whole it does 
<A NAME="368"></A>not simultaneously change its place, though it will be moved in a circle: 
<A NAME="369"></A>for this place is the place of its parts. (Some things are moved, not up 
<A NAME="370"></A>and down, but in a circle; others up and down, such things namely as admit 
<A NAME="371"></A>of condensation and rarefaction.)
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>As was explained, some things are potentially in place, others 
<A NAME="373"></A>actually. So, when you have a homogeneous substance which is continuous, 
<A NAME="374"></A>the parts are potentially in place: when the parts are separated, but in 
<A NAME="375"></A>contact, like a heap, they are actually in place.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>Again, (1) some things are per se in place, namely every body which 
<A NAME="377"></A>is movable either by way of locomotion or by way of increase is per se 
<A NAME="378"></A>somewhere, but the heaven, as has been said, is not anywhere as a whole, 
<A NAME="379"></A>nor in any place, if at least, as we must suppose, no body contains it. 
<A NAME="380"></A>On the line on which it is moved, its parts have place: for each is contiguous 
<A NAME="381"></A>the next.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>But (2) other things are in place indirectly, through something 
<A NAME="383"></A>conjoined with them, as the soul and the heaven. The latter is, in a way, 
<A NAME="384"></A>in place, for all its parts are: for on the orb one part contains another. 
<A NAME="385"></A>That is why the upper part is moved in a circle, while the All is not anywhere. 
<A NAME="386"></A>For what is somewhere is itself something, and there must be alongside 
<A NAME="387"></A>it some other thing wherein it is and which contains it. But alongside 
<A NAME="388"></A>the All or the Whole there is nothing outside the All, and for this reason 
<A NAME="389"></A>all things are in the heaven; for the heaven, we may say, is the All. Yet 
<A NAME="390"></A>their place is not the same as the heaven. It is part of it, the innermost 
<A NAME="391"></A>part of it, which is in contact with the movable body; and for this reason 
<A NAME="392"></A>the earth is in water, and this in the air, and the air in the aether, 
<A NAME="393"></A>and the aether in heaven, but we cannot go on and say that the heaven is 
<A NAME="394"></A>in anything else.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>It is clear, too, from these considerations that all the problems 
<A NAME="396"></A>which were raised about place will be solved when it is explained in this 
<A NAME="397"></A>way:
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>(1) There is no necessity that the place should grow with the body 
<A NAME="399"></A>in it,
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>(2) Nor that a point should have a place,
<A NAME="401"></A><BR>(3) Nor that two bodies should be in the same place,
<A NAME="402"></A><BR>(4) Nor that place should be a corporeal interval: for what is between 
<A NAME="403"></A>the boundaries of the place is any body which may chance to be there, not 
<A NAME="404"></A>an interval in body.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>Further, (5) place is also somewhere, not in the sense of being 
<A NAME="406"></A>in a place, but as the limit is in the limited; for not everything that 
<A NAME="407"></A>is is in place, but only movable body.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>Also (6) it is reasonable that each kind of body should be carried 
<A NAME="409"></A>to its own place. For a body which is next in the series and in contact 
<A NAME="410"></A>(not by compulsion) is akin, and bodies which are united do not affect 
<A NAME="411"></A>each other, while those which are in contact interact on each 
<A NAME="412"></A>other.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>Nor (7) is it without reason that each should remain naturally 
<A NAME="414"></A>in its proper place. For this part has the same relation to its place, 
<A NAME="415"></A>as a separable part to its whole, as when one moves a part of water or 
<A NAME="416"></A>air: so, too, air is related to water, for the one is like matter, the 
<A NAME="417"></A>other form-water is the matter of air, air as it were the actuality of 
<A NAME="418"></A>water, for water is potentially air, while air is potentially water, though 
<A NAME="419"></A>in another way.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>These distinctions will be drawn more carefully later. On the present 
<A NAME="421"></A>occasion it was necessary to refer to them: what has now been stated obscurely 
<A NAME="422"></A>will then be made more clear. If the matter and the fulfilment are the 
<A NAME="423"></A>same thing (for water is both, the one potentially, the other completely), 
<A NAME="424"></A>water will be related to air in a way as part to whole. That is why these 
<A NAME="425"></A>have contact: it is organic union when both become actually 
<A NAME="426"></A>one.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>This concludes my account of place-both of its existence and of 
<A NAME="428"></A>its nature.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="429"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR>The investigation of similar questions about the void, also, must 
<A NAME="431"></A>be held to belong to the physicist-namely whether it exists or not, and 
<A NAME="432"></A>how it exists or what it is-just as about place. The views taken of it 
<A NAME="433"></A>involve arguments both for and against, in much the same sort of way. For 
<A NAME="434"></A>those who hold that the void exists regard it as a sort of place or vessel 
<A NAME="435"></A>which is supposed to be 'full' when it holds the bulk which it is capable 
<A NAME="436"></A>of containing, 'void' when it is deprived of that-as if 'void' and 'full' 
<A NAME="437"></A>and 'place' denoted the same thing, though the essence of the three is 
<A NAME="438"></A>different.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>We must begin the inquiry by putting down the account given by 
<A NAME="440"></A>those who say that it exists, then the account of those who say that it 
<A NAME="441"></A>does not exist, and third the current view on these 
<A NAME="442"></A>questions.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>Those who try to show that the void does not exist do not disprove 
<A NAME="444"></A>what people really mean by it, but only their erroneous way of speaking; 
<A NAME="445"></A>this is true of Anaxagoras and of those who refute the existence of the 
<A NAME="446"></A>void in this way. They merely give an ingenious demonstration that air 
<A NAME="447"></A>is something--by straining wine-skins and showing the resistance of the 
<A NAME="448"></A>air, and by cutting it off in clepsydras. But people really mean that there 
<A NAME="449"></A>is an empty interval in which there is no sensible body. They hold that 
<A NAME="450"></A>everything which is in body is body and say that what has nothing in it 
<A NAME="451"></A>at all is void (so what is full of air is void). It is not then the existence 
<A NAME="452"></A>of air that needs to be proved, but the non-existence of an interval, different 
<A NAME="453"></A>from the bodies, either separable or actual-an interval which divides the 
<A NAME="454"></A>whole body so as to break its continuity, as Democritus and Leucippus hold, 
<A NAME="455"></A>and many other physicists-or even perhaps as something which is outside 
<A NAME="456"></A>the whole body, which remains continuous.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>These people, then, have not reached even the threshold of the 
<A NAME="458"></A>problem, but rather those who say that the void exists.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>(1) They argue, for one thing, that change in place (i.e. locomotion 
<A NAME="460"></A>and increase) would not be. For it is maintained that motion would seem 
<A NAME="461"></A>not to exist, if there were no void, since what is full cannot contain 
<A NAME="462"></A>anything more. If it could, and there were two bodies in the same place, 
<A NAME="463"></A>it would also be true that any number of bodies could be together; for 
<A NAME="464"></A>it is impossible to draw a line of division beyond which the statement 
<A NAME="465"></A>would become untrue. If this were possible, it would follow also that the 
<A NAME="466"></A>smallest body would contain the greatest; for 'many a little makes a mickle': 
<A NAME="467"></A>thus if many equal bodies can be together, so also can many unequal 
<A NAME="468"></A>bodies.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>Melissus, indeed, infers from these considerations that the All 
<A NAME="470"></A>is immovable; for if it were moved there must, he says, be void, but void 
<A NAME="471"></A>is not among the things that exist.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>This argument, then, is one way in which they show that there is 
<A NAME="473"></A>a void.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>(2) They reason from the fact that some things are observed to 
<A NAME="475"></A>contract and be compressed, as people say that a cask will hold the wine 
<A NAME="476"></A>which formerly filled it, along with the skins into which the wine has 
<A NAME="477"></A>been decanted, which implies that the compressed body contracts into the 
<A NAME="478"></A>voids present in it.
<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>Again (3) increase, too, is thought to take always by means of 
<A NAME="480"></A>void, for nutriment is body, and it is impossible for two bodies to be 
<A NAME="481"></A>together. A proof of this they find also in what happens to ashes, which 
<A NAME="482"></A>absorb as much water as the empty vessel.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>The Pythagoreans, too, (4) held that void exists and that it enters 
<A NAME="484"></A>the heaven itself, which as it were inhales it, from the infinite air. 
<A NAME="485"></A>Further it is the void which distinguishes the natures of things, as if 
<A NAME="486"></A>it were like what separates and distinguishes the terms of a series. This 
<A NAME="487"></A>holds primarily in the numbers, for the void distinguishes their 
<A NAME="488"></A>nature.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR>These, then, and so many, are the main grounds on which people 
<A NAME="490"></A>have argued for and against the existence of the void.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="491"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>As a step towards settling which view is true, we must determine 
<A NAME="493"></A>the meaning of the name.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR>The void is thought to be place with nothing in it. The reason 
<A NAME="495"></A>for this is that people take what exists to be body, and hold that while 
<A NAME="496"></A>every body is in place, void is place in which there is no body, so that 
<A NAME="497"></A>where there is no body, there must be void.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><BR>Every body, again, they suppose to be tangible; and of this nature 
<A NAME="499"></A>is whatever has weight or lightness.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>Hence, by a syllogism, what has nothing heavy or light in it, is 
<A NAME="501"></A>void.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>This result, then, as I have said, is reached by syllogism. It 
<A NAME="503"></A>would be absurd to suppose that the point is void; for the void must be 
<A NAME="504"></A>place which has in it an interval in tangible body.
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>But at all events we observe then that in one way the void is described 
<A NAME="506"></A>as what is not full of body perceptible to touch; and what has heaviness 
<A NAME="507"></A>and lightness is perceptible to touch. So we would raise the question: 
<A NAME="508"></A>what would they say of an interval that has colour or sound-is it void 
<A NAME="509"></A>or not? Clearly they would reply that if it could receive what is tangible 
<A NAME="510"></A>it was void, and if not, not.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>In another way void is that in which there is no 'this' or corporeal 
<A NAME="512"></A>substance. So some say that the void is the matter of the body (they identify 
<A NAME="513"></A>the place, too, with this), and in this they speak incorrectly; for the 
<A NAME="514"></A>matter is not separable from the things, but they are inquiring about the 
<A NAME="515"></A>void as about something separable.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>Since we have determined the nature of place, and void must, if 
<A NAME="517"></A>it exists, be place deprived of body, and we have stated both in what sense 
<A NAME="518"></A>place exists and in what sense it does not, it is plain that on this showing 
<A NAME="519"></A>void does not exist, either unseparated or separated; the void is meant 
<A NAME="520"></A>to be, not body but rather an interval in body. This is why the void is 
<A NAME="521"></A>thought to be something, viz. because place is, and for the same reasons. 
<A NAME="522"></A>For the fact of motion in respect of place comes to the aid both of those 
<A NAME="523"></A>who maintain that place is something over and above the bodies that come 
<A NAME="524"></A>to occupy it, and of those who maintain that the void is something. They 
<A NAME="525"></A>state that the void is the condition of movement in the sense of that in 
<A NAME="526"></A>which movement takes place; and this would be the kind of thing that some 
<A NAME="527"></A>say place is.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>But there is no necessity for there being a void if there is movement. 
<A NAME="529"></A>It is not in the least needed as a condition of movement in general, for 
<A NAME="530"></A>a reason which, incidentally, escaped Melissus; viz. that the full can 
<A NAME="531"></A>suffer qualitative change.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR>But not even movement in respect of place involves a void; for 
<A NAME="533"></A>bodies may simultaneously make room for one another, though there is no 
<A NAME="534"></A>interval separate and apart from the bodies that are in movement. And this 
<A NAME="535"></A>is plain even in the rotation of continuous things, as in that of 
<A NAME="536"></A>liquids.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>And things can also be compressed not into a void but because they 
<A NAME="538"></A>squeeze out what is contained in them (as, for instance, when water is 
<A NAME="539"></A>compressed the air within it is squeezed out); and things can increase 
<A NAME="540"></A>in size not only by the entrance of something but also by qualitative change; 
<A NAME="541"></A>e.g. if water were to be transformed into air.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>In general, both the argument about increase of size and that about 
<A NAME="543"></A>water poured on to the ashes get in their own way. For either not any and 
<A NAME="544"></A>every part of the body is increased, or bodies may be increased otherwise 
<A NAME="545"></A>than by the addition of body, or there may be two bodies in the same place 
<A NAME="546"></A>(in which case they are claiming to solve a quite general difficulty, but 
<A NAME="547"></A>are not proving the existence of void), or the whole body must be void, 
<A NAME="548"></A>if it is increased in every part and is increased by means of void. The 
<A NAME="549"></A>same argument applies to the ashes.
<A NAME="550"></A><BR><BR>It is evident, then, that it is easy to refute the arguments by 
<A NAME="551"></A>which they prove the existence of the void.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="552"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>Let us explain again that there is no void existing separately, 
<A NAME="554"></A>as some maintain. If each of the simple bodies has a natural locomotion, 
<A NAME="555"></A>e.g. fire upward and earth downward and towards the middle of the universe, 
<A NAME="556"></A>it is clear that it cannot be the void that is the condition of locomotion. 
<A NAME="557"></A>What, then, will the void be the condition of? It is thought to be the 
<A NAME="558"></A>condition of movement in respect of place, and it is not the condition 
<A NAME="559"></A>of this.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>Again, if void is a sort of place deprived of body, when there 
<A NAME="561"></A>is a void where will a body placed in it move to? It certainly cannot move 
<A NAME="562"></A>into the whole of the void. The same argument applies as against those 
<A NAME="563"></A>who think that place is something separate, into which things are carried; 
<A NAME="564"></A>viz. how will what is placed in it move, or rest? Much the same argument 
<A NAME="565"></A>will apply to the void as to the 'up' and 'down' in place, as is natural 
<A NAME="566"></A>enough since those who maintain the existence of the void make it a 
<A NAME="567"></A>place.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>And in what way will things be present either in place-or in the 
<A NAME="569"></A>void? For the expected result does not take place when a body is placed 
<A NAME="570"></A>as a whole in a place conceived of as separate and permanent; for a part 
<A NAME="571"></A>of it, unless it be placed apart, will not be in a place but in the whole. 
<A NAME="572"></A>Further, if separate place does not exist, neither will 
<A NAME="573"></A>void.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>If people say that the void must exist, as being necessary if there 
<A NAME="575"></A>is to be movement, what rather turns out to be the case, if one the matter, 
<A NAME="576"></A>is the opposite, that not a single thing can be moved if there is a void; 
<A NAME="577"></A>for as with those who for a like reason say the earth is at rest, so, too, 
<A NAME="578"></A>in the void things must be at rest; for there is no place to which things 
<A NAME="579"></A>can move more or less than to another; since the void in so far as it is 
<A NAME="580"></A>void admits no difference.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR>The second reason is this: all movement is either compulsory or 
<A NAME="582"></A>according to nature, and if there is compulsory movement there must also 
<A NAME="583"></A>be natural (for compulsory movement is contrary to nature, and movement 
<A NAME="584"></A>contrary to nature is posterior to that according to nature, so that if 
<A NAME="585"></A>each of the natural bodies has not a natural movement, none of the other 
<A NAME="586"></A>movements can exist); but how can there be natural movement if there is 
<A NAME="587"></A>no difference throughout the void or the infinite? For in so far as it 
<A NAME="588"></A>is infinite, there will be no up or down or middle, and in so far as it 
<A NAME="589"></A>is a void, up differs no whit from down; for as there is no difference 
<A NAME="590"></A>in what is nothing, there is none in the void (for the void seems to be 
<A NAME="591"></A>a non-existent and a privation of being), but natural locomotion seems 
<A NAME="592"></A>to be differentiated, so that the things that exist by nature must be differentiated. 
<A NAME="593"></A>Either, then, nothing has a natural locomotion, or else there is no 
<A NAME="594"></A>void.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>Further, in point of fact things that are thrown move though that 
<A NAME="596"></A>which gave them their impulse is not touching them, either by reason of 
<A NAME="597"></A>mutual replacement, as some maintain, or because the air that has been 
<A NAME="598"></A>pushed pushes them with a movement quicker than the natural locomotion 
<A NAME="599"></A>of the projectile wherewith it moves to its proper place. But in a void 
<A NAME="600"></A>none of these things can take place, nor can anything be moved save as 
<A NAME="601"></A>that which is carried is moved.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR>Further, no one could say why a thing once set in motion should 
<A NAME="603"></A>stop anywhere; for why should it stop here rather than here? So that a 
<A NAME="604"></A>thing will either be at rest or must be moved ad infinitum, unless something 
<A NAME="605"></A>more powerful get in its way.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR>Further, things are now thought to move into the void because it 
<A NAME="607"></A>yields; but in a void this quality is present equally everywhere, so that 
<A NAME="608"></A>things should move in all directions.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR>Further, the truth of what we assert is plain from the following 
<A NAME="610"></A>considerations. We see the same weight or body moving faster than another 
<A NAME="611"></A>for two reasons, either because there is a difference in what it moves 
<A NAME="612"></A>through, as between water, air, and earth, or because, other things being 
<A NAME="613"></A>equal, the moving body differs from the other owing to excess of weight 
<A NAME="614"></A>or of lightness.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>Now the medium causes a difference because it impedes the moving 
<A NAME="616"></A>thing, most of all if it is moving in the opposite direction, but in a 
<A NAME="617"></A>secondary degree even if it is at rest; and especially a medium that is 
<A NAME="618"></A>not easily divided, i.e. a medium that is somewhat dense. A, then, will 
<A NAME="619"></A>move through B in time G, and through D, which is thinner, in time E (if 
<A NAME="620"></A>the length of B is egual to D), in proportion to the density of the hindering 
<A NAME="621"></A>body. For let B be water and D air; then by so much as air is thinner and 
<A NAME="622"></A>more incorporeal than water, A will move through D faster than through 
<A NAME="623"></A>B. Let the speed have the same ratio to the speed, then, that air has to 
<A NAME="624"></A>water. Then if air is twice as thin, the body will traverse B in twice 
<A NAME="625"></A>the time that it does D, and the time G will be twice the time E. And always, 
<A NAME="626"></A>by so much as the medium is more incorporeal and less resistant and more 
<A NAME="627"></A>easily divided, the faster will be the movement.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR><BR>Now there is no ratio in which the void is exceeded by body, as 
<A NAME="629"></A>there is no ratio of 0 to a number. For if 4 exceeds 3 by 1, and 2 by more 
<A NAME="630"></A>than 1, and 1 by still more than it exceeds 2, still there is no ratio 
<A NAME="631"></A>by which it exceeds 0; for that which exceeds must be divisible into the 
<A NAME="632"></A>excess + that which is exceeded, so that will be what it exceeds 0 by + 
<A NAME="633"></A>0. For this reason, too, a line does not exceed a point unless it is composed 
<A NAME="634"></A>of points! Similarly the void can bear no ratio to the full, and therefore 
<A NAME="635"></A>neither can movement through the one to movement through the other, but 
<A NAME="636"></A>if a thing moves through the thickest medium such and such a distance in 
<A NAME="637"></A>such and such a time, it moves through the void with a speed beyond any 
<A NAME="638"></A>ratio. For let Z be void, equal in magnitude to B and to D. Then if A is 
<A NAME="639"></A>to traverse and move through it in a certain time, H, a time less than 
<A NAME="640"></A>E, however, the void will bear this ratio to the full. But in a time equal 
<A NAME="641"></A>to H, A will traverse the part O of A. And it will surely also traverse 
<A NAME="642"></A>in that time any substance Z which exceeds air in thickness in the ratio 
<A NAME="643"></A>which the time E bears to the time H. For if the body Z be as much thinner 
<A NAME="644"></A>than D as E exceeds H, A, if it moves through Z, will traverse it in a 
<A NAME="645"></A>time inverse to the speed of the movement, i.e. in a time equal to H. If, 
<A NAME="646"></A>then, there is no body in Z, A will traverse Z still more quickly. But 
<A NAME="647"></A>we supposed that its traverse of Z when Z was void occupied the time H. 
<A NAME="648"></A>So that it will traverse Z in an equal time whether Z be full or void. 
<A NAME="649"></A>But this is impossible. It is plain, then, that if there is a time in which 
<A NAME="650"></A>it will move through any part of the void, this impossible result will 
<A NAME="651"></A>follow: it will be found to traverse a certain distance, whether this be 
<A NAME="652"></A>full or void, in an equal time; for there will be some body which is in 
<A NAME="653"></A>the same ratio to the other body as the time is to the 
<A NAME="654"></A>time.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>To sum the matter up, the cause of this result is obvious, viz. 
<A NAME="656"></A>that between any two movements there is a ratio (for they occupy time, 
<A NAME="657"></A>and there is a ratio between any two times, so long as both are finite), 
<A NAME="658"></A>but there is no ratio of void to full.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR>These are the consequences that result from a difference in the 
<A NAME="660"></A>media; the following depend upon an excess of one moving body over another. 
<A NAME="661"></A>We see that bodies which have a greater impulse either of weight or of 
<A NAME="662"></A>lightness, if they are alike in other respects, move faster over an equal 
<A NAME="663"></A>space, and in the ratio which their magnitudes bear to each other. Therefore 
<A NAME="664"></A>they will also move through the void with this ratio of speed. But that 
<A NAME="665"></A>is impossible; for why should one move faster? (In moving through plena 
<A NAME="666"></A>it must be so; for the greater divides them faster by its force. For a 
<A NAME="667"></A>moving thing cleaves the medium either by its shape, or by the impulse 
<A NAME="668"></A>which the body that is carried along or is projected possesses.) Therefore 
<A NAME="669"></A>all will possess equal velocity. But this is impossible.
<A NAME="670"></A><BR><BR>It is evident from what has been said, then, that, if there is 
<A NAME="671"></A>a void, a result follows which is the very opposite of the reason for which 
<A NAME="672"></A>those who believe in a void set it up. They think that if movement in respect 
<A NAME="673"></A>of place is to exist, the void cannot exist, separated all by itself; but 
<A NAME="674"></A>this is the same as to say that place is a separate cavity; and this has 
<A NAME="675"></A>already been stated to be impossible.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR>But even if we consider it on its own merits the so-called vacuum 
<A NAME="677"></A>will be found to be really vacuous. For as, if one puts a cube in water, 
<A NAME="678"></A>an amount of water equal to the cube will be displaced; so too in air; 
<A NAME="679"></A>but the effect is imperceptible to sense. And indeed always in the case 
<A NAME="680"></A>of any body that can be displaced, must, if it is not compressed, be displaced 
<A NAME="681"></A>in the direction in which it is its nature to be displaced-always either 
<A NAME="682"></A>down, if its locomotion is downwards as in the case of earth, or up, if 
<A NAME="683"></A>it is fire, or in both directions-whatever be the nature of the inserted 
<A NAME="684"></A>body. Now in the void this is impossible; for it is not body; the void 
<A NAME="685"></A>must have penetrated the cube to a distance equal to that which this portion 
<A NAME="686"></A>of void formerly occupied in the void, just as if the water or air had 
<A NAME="687"></A>not been displaced by the wooden cube, but had penetrated right through 
<A NAME="688"></A>it.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR><BR>But the cube also has a magnitude equal to that occupied by the 
<A NAME="690"></A>void; a magnitude which, if it is also hot or cold, or heavy or light, 
<A NAME="691"></A>is none the less different in essence from all its attributes, even if 
<A NAME="692"></A>it is not separable from them; I mean the volume of the wooden cube. So 
<A NAME="693"></A>that even if it were separated from everything else and were neither heavy 
<A NAME="694"></A>nor light, it will occupy an equal amount of void, and fill the same place, 
<A NAME="695"></A>as the part of place or of the void equal to itself. How then will the 
<A NAME="696"></A>body of the cube differ from the void or place that is equal to it? And 
<A NAME="697"></A>if there can be two such things, why cannot there be any number 
<A NAME="698"></A>coinciding?
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>This, then, is one absurd and impossible implication of the theory. 
<A NAME="700"></A>It is also evident that the cube will have this same volume even if it 
<A NAME="701"></A>is displaced, which is an attribute possessed by all other bodies also. 
<A NAME="702"></A>Therefore if this differs in no respect from its place, why need we assume 
<A NAME="703"></A>a place for bodies over and above the volume of each, if their volume be 
<A NAME="704"></A>conceived of as free from attributes? It contributes nothing to the situation 
<A NAME="705"></A>if there is an equal interval attached to it as well. [Further it ought 
<A NAME="706"></A>to be clear by the study of moving things what sort of thing void is. But 
<A NAME="707"></A>in fact it is found nowhere in the world. For air is something, though 
<A NAME="708"></A>it does not seem to be so-nor, for that matter, would water, if fishes 
<A NAME="709"></A>were made of iron; for the discrimination of the tangible is by 
<A NAME="710"></A>touch.]
<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR>It is clear, then, from these considerations that there is no separate 
<A NAME="712"></A>void.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="713"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="714"></A><BR><BR>There are some who think that the existence of rarity and density 
<A NAME="715"></A>shows that there is a void. If rarity and density do not exist, they say, 
<A NAME="716"></A>neither can things contract and be compressed. But if this were not to 
<A NAME="717"></A>take place, either there would be no movement at all, or the universe would 
<A NAME="718"></A>bulge, as Xuthus said, or air and water must always change into equal amounts 
<A NAME="719"></A>(e.g. if air has been made out of a cupful of water, at the same time out 
<A NAME="720"></A>of an equal amount of air a cupful of water must have been made), or void 
<A NAME="721"></A>must necessarily exist; for compression and expansion cannot take place 
<A NAME="722"></A>otherwise.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>Now, if they mean by the rare that which has many voids existing 
<A NAME="724"></A>separately, it is plain that if void cannot exist separate any more than 
<A NAME="725"></A>a place can exist with an extension all to itself, neither can the rare 
<A NAME="726"></A>exist in this sense. But if they mean that there is void, not separately 
<A NAME="727"></A>existent, but still present in the rare, this is less impossible, yet, 
<A NAME="728"></A>first, the void turns out not to be a condition of all movement, but only 
<A NAME="729"></A>of movement upwards (for the rare is light, which is the reason why they 
<A NAME="730"></A>say fire is rare); second, the void turns out to be a condition of movement 
<A NAME="731"></A>not as that in which it takes place, but in that the void carries things 
<A NAME="732"></A>up as skins by being carried up themselves carry up what is continuous 
<A NAME="733"></A>with them. Yet how can void have a local movement or a place? For thus 
<A NAME="734"></A>that into which void moves is till then void of a void.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR><BR>Again, how will they explain, in the case of what is heavy, its 
<A NAME="736"></A>movement downwards? And it is plain that if the rarer and more void a thing 
<A NAME="737"></A>is the quicker it will move upwards, if it were completely void it would 
<A NAME="738"></A>move with a maximum speed! But perhaps even this is impossible, that it 
<A NAME="739"></A>should move at all; the same reason which showed that in the void all things 
<A NAME="740"></A>are incapable of moving shows that the void cannot move, viz. the fact 
<A NAME="741"></A>that the speeds are incomparable.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR>Since we deny that a void exists, but for the rest the problem 
<A NAME="743"></A>has been truly stated, that either there will be no movement, if there 
<A NAME="744"></A>is not to be condensation and rarefaction, or the universe will bulge, 
<A NAME="745"></A>or a transformation of water into air will always be balanced by an equal 
<A NAME="746"></A>transformation of air into water (for it is clear that the air produced 
<A NAME="747"></A>from water is bulkier than the water): it is necessary therefore, if compression 
<A NAME="748"></A>does not exist, either that the next portion will be pushed outwards and 
<A NAME="749"></A>make the outermost part bulge, or that somewhere else there must be an 
<A NAME="750"></A>equal amount of water produced out of air, so that the entire bulk of the 
<A NAME="751"></A>whole may be equal, or that nothing moves. For when anything is displaced 
<A NAME="752"></A>this will always happen, unless it comes round in a circle; but locomotion 
<A NAME="753"></A>is not always circular, but sometimes in a straight 
<A NAME="754"></A>line.
<A NAME="755"></A><BR><BR>These then are the reasons for which they might say that there 
<A NAME="756"></A>is a void; our statement is based on the assumption that there is a single 
<A NAME="757"></A>matter for contraries, hot and cold and the other natural contrarieties, 
<A NAME="758"></A>and that what exists actually is produced from a potential existent, and 
<A NAME="759"></A>that matter is not separable from the contraries but its being is different, 
<A NAME="760"></A>and that a single matter may serve for colour and heat and 
<A NAME="761"></A>cold.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR><BR>The same matter also serves for both a large and a small body. 
<A NAME="763"></A>This is evident; for when air is produced from water, the same matter has 
<A NAME="764"></A>become something different, not by acquiring an addition to it, but has 
<A NAME="765"></A>become actually what it was potentially, and, again, water is produced 
<A NAME="766"></A>from air in the same way, the change being sometimes from smallness to 
<A NAME="767"></A>greatness, and sometimes from greatness to smallness. Similarly, therefore, 
<A NAME="768"></A>if air which is large in extent comes to have a smaller volume, or becomes 
<A NAME="769"></A>greater from being smaller, it is the matter which is potentially both 
<A NAME="770"></A>that comes to be each of the two.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR><BR>For as the same matter becomes hot from being cold, and cold from 
<A NAME="772"></A>being hot, because it was potentially both, so too from hot it can become 
<A NAME="773"></A>more hot, though nothing in the matter has become hot that was not hot 
<A NAME="774"></A>when the thing was less hot; just as, if the arc or curve of a greater 
<A NAME="775"></A>circle becomes that of a smaller, whether it remains the same or becomes 
<A NAME="776"></A>a different curve, convexity has not come to exist in anything that was 
<A NAME="777"></A>not convex but straight (for differences of degree do not depend on an 
<A NAME="778"></A>intermission of the quality); nor can we get any portion of a flame, in 
<A NAME="779"></A>which both heat and whiteness are not present. So too, then, is the earlier 
<A NAME="780"></A>heat related to the later. So that the greatness and smallness, also, of 
<A NAME="781"></A>the sensible volume are extended, not by the matter's acquiring anything 
<A NAME="782"></A>new, but because the matter is potentially matter for both states; so that 
<A NAME="783"></A>the same thing is dense and rare, and the two qualities have one 
<A NAME="784"></A>matter.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR>The dense is heavy, and the rare is light. [Again, as the arc of 
<A NAME="786"></A>a circle when contracted into a smaller space does not acquire a new part 
<A NAME="787"></A>which is convex, but what was there has been contracted; and as any part 
<A NAME="788"></A>of fire that one takes will be hot; so, too, it is all a question of contraction 
<A NAME="789"></A>and expansion of the same matter.] There are two types in each case, both 
<A NAME="790"></A>in the dense and in the rare; for both the heavy and the hard are thought 
<A NAME="791"></A>to be dense, and contrariwise both the light and the soft are rare; and 
<A NAME="792"></A>weight and hardness fail to coincide in the case of lead and 
<A NAME="793"></A>iron.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR><BR>From what has been said it is evident, then, that void does not 
<A NAME="795"></A>exist either separate (either absolutely separate or as a separate element 
<A NAME="796"></A>in the rare) or potentially, unless one is willing to call the condition 
<A NAME="797"></A>of movement void, whatever it may be. At that rate the matter of the heavy 
<A NAME="798"></A>and the light, qua matter of them, would be the void; for the dense and 
<A NAME="799"></A>the rare are productive of locomotion in virtue of this contrariety, and 
<A NAME="800"></A>in virtue of their hardness and softness productive of passivity and impassivity, 
<A NAME="801"></A>i.e. not of locomotion but rather of qualitative change.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>So much, then, for the discussion of the void, and of the sense 
<A NAME="803"></A>in which it exists and the sense in which it does not 
<A NAME="804"></A>exist.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="805"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR>Next for discussion after the subjects mentioned is Time. The best 
<A NAME="807"></A>plan will be to begin by working out the difficulties connected with it, 
<A NAME="808"></A>making use of the current arguments. First, does it belong to the class 
<A NAME="809"></A>of things that exist or to that of things that do not exist? Then secondly, 
<A NAME="810"></A>what is its nature? To start, then: the following considerations would 
<A NAME="811"></A>make one suspect that it either does not exist at all or barely, and in 
<A NAME="812"></A>an obscure way. One part of it has been and is not, while the other is 
<A NAME="813"></A>going to be and is not yet. Yet time-both infinite time and any time you 
<A NAME="814"></A>like to take-is made up of these. One would naturally suppose that what 
<A NAME="815"></A>is made up of things which do not exist could have no share in 
<A NAME="816"></A>reality.
<A NAME="817"></A><BR><BR>Further, if a divisible thing is to exist, it is necessary that, 
<A NAME="818"></A>when it exists, all or some of its parts must exist. But of time some parts 
<A NAME="819"></A>have been, while others have to be, and no part of it is though it is divisible. 
<A NAME="820"></A>For what is 'now' is not a part: a part is a measure of the whole, which 
<A NAME="821"></A>must be made up of parts. Time, on the other hand, is not held to be made 
<A NAME="822"></A>up of 'nows'.
<A NAME="823"></A><BR><BR>Again, the 'now' which seems to bound the past and the future-does 
<A NAME="824"></A>it always remain one and the same or is it always other and other? It is 
<A NAME="825"></A>hard to say.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR>(1) If it is always different and different, and if none of the 
<A NAME="827"></A>parts in time which are other and other are simultaneous (unless the one 
<A NAME="828"></A>contains and the other is contained, as the shorter time is by the longer), 
<A NAME="829"></A>and if the 'now' which is not, but formerly was, must have ceased-to-be 
<A NAME="830"></A>at some time, the 'nows' too cannot be simultaneous with one another, but 
<A NAME="831"></A>the prior 'now' must always have ceased-to-be. But the prior 'now' cannot 
<A NAME="832"></A>have ceased-to-be in itself (since it then existed); yet it cannot have 
<A NAME="833"></A>ceased-to-be in another 'now'. For we may lay it down that one 'now' cannot 
<A NAME="834"></A>be next to another, any more than point to point. If then it did not cease-to-be 
<A NAME="835"></A>in the next 'now' but in another, it would exist simultaneously with the 
<A NAME="836"></A>innumerable 'nows' between the two-which is impossible.
<A NAME="837"></A><BR><BR>Yes, but (2) neither is it possible for the 'now' to remain always 
<A NAME="838"></A>the same. No determinate divisible thing has a single termination, whether 
<A NAME="839"></A>it is continuously extended in one or in more than one dimension: but the 
<A NAME="840"></A>'now' is a termination, and it is possible to cut off a determinate time. 
<A NAME="841"></A>Further, if coincidence in time (i.e. being neither prior nor posterior) 
<A NAME="842"></A>means to be 'in one and the same "now"', then, if both what is before and 
<A NAME="843"></A>what is after are in this same 'now', things which happened ten thousand 
<A NAME="844"></A>years ago would be simultaneous with what has happened to-day, and nothing 
<A NAME="845"></A>would be before or after anything else.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR><BR>This may serve as a statement of the difficulties about the attributes 
<A NAME="847"></A>of time.
<A NAME="848"></A><BR><BR>As to what time is or what is its nature, the traditional accounts 
<A NAME="849"></A>give us as little light as the preliminary problems which we have worked 
<A NAME="850"></A>through.
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR>Some assert that it is (1) the movement of the whole, others that 
<A NAME="852"></A>it is (2) the sphere itself.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR>(1) Yet part, too, of the revolution is a time, but it certainly 
<A NAME="854"></A>is not a revolution: for what is taken is part of a revolution, not a revolution. 
<A NAME="855"></A>Besides, if there were more heavens than one, the movement of any of them 
<A NAME="856"></A>equally would be time, so that there would be many times at the same 
<A NAME="857"></A>time.
<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR>(2) Those who said that time is the sphere of the whole thought 
<A NAME="859"></A>so, no doubt, on the ground that all things are in time and all things 
<A NAME="860"></A>are in the sphere of the whole. The view is too naive for it to be worth 
<A NAME="861"></A>while to consider the impossibilities implied in it.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR>But as time is most usually supposed to be (3) motion and a kind 
<A NAME="863"></A>of change, we must consider this view.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR><BR>Now (a) the change or movement of each thing is only in the thing 
<A NAME="865"></A>which changes or where the thing itself which moves or changes may chance 
<A NAME="866"></A>to be. But time is present equally everywhere and with all 
<A NAME="867"></A>things.
<A NAME="868"></A><BR><BR>Again, (b) change is always faster or slower, whereas time is not: 
<A NAME="869"></A>for 'fast' and 'slow' are defined by time-'fast' is what moves much in 
<A NAME="870"></A>a short time, 'slow' what moves little in a long time; but time is not 
<A NAME="871"></A>defined by time, by being either a certain amount or a certain kind of 
<A NAME="872"></A>it.
<A NAME="873"></A><BR><BR>Clearly then it is not movement. (We need not distinguish at present 
<A NAME="874"></A>between 'movement' and 'change'.)
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="875"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="876"></A><BR><BR>But neither does time exist without change; for when the state 
<A NAME="877"></A>of our own minds does not change at all, or we have not noticed its changing, 
<A NAME="878"></A>we do not realize that time has elapsed, any more than those who are fabled 
<A NAME="879"></A>to sleep among the heroes in Sardinia do when they are awakened; for they 
<A NAME="880"></A>connect the earlier 'now' with the later and make them one, cutting out 
<A NAME="881"></A>the interval because of their failure to notice it. So, just as, if the 
<A NAME="882"></A>'now' were not different but one and the same, there would not have been 
<A NAME="883"></A>time, so too when its difference escapes our notice the interval does not 
<A NAME="884"></A>seem to be time. If, then, the non-realization of the existence of time 
<A NAME="885"></A>happens to us when we do not distinguish any change, but the soul seems 
<A NAME="886"></A>to stay in one indivisible state, and when we perceive and distinguish 
<A NAME="887"></A>we say time has elapsed, evidently time is not independent of movement 
<A NAME="888"></A>and change. It is evident, then, that time is neither movement nor independent 
<A NAME="889"></A>of movement.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR>We must take this as our starting-point and try to discover-since 
<A NAME="891"></A>we wish to know what time is-what exactly it has to do with 
<A NAME="892"></A>movement.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR>Now we perceive movement and time together: for even when it is 
<A NAME="894"></A>dark and we are not being affected through the body, if any movement takes 
<A NAME="895"></A>place in the mind we at once suppose that some time also has elapsed; and 
<A NAME="896"></A>not only that but also, when some time is thought to have passed, some 
<A NAME="897"></A>movement also along with it seems to have taken place. Hence time is either 
<A NAME="898"></A>movement or something that belongs to movement. Since then it is not movement, 
<A NAME="899"></A>it must be the other.
<A NAME="900"></A><BR><BR>But what is moved is moved from something to something, and all 
<A NAME="901"></A>magnitude is continuous. Therefore the movement goes with the magnitude. 
<A NAME="902"></A>Because the magnitude is continuous, the movement too must be continuous, 
<A NAME="903"></A>and if the movement, then the time; for the time that has passed is always 
<A NAME="904"></A>thought to be in proportion to the movement.
<A NAME="905"></A><BR><BR>The distinction of 'before' and 'after' holds primarily, then, 
<A NAME="906"></A>in place; and there in virtue of relative position. Since then 'before' 
<A NAME="907"></A>and 'after' hold in magnitude, they must hold also in movement, these corresponding 
<A NAME="908"></A>to those. But also in time the distinction of 'before' and 'after' must 
<A NAME="909"></A>hold, for time and movement always correspond with each other. The 'before' 
<A NAME="910"></A>and 'after' in motion is identical in substratum with motion yet differs 
<A NAME="911"></A>from it in definition, and is not identical with motion.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR>But we apprehend time only when we have marked motion, marking 
<A NAME="913"></A>it by 'before' and 'after'; and it is only when we have perceived 'before' 
<A NAME="914"></A>and 'after' in motion that we say that time has elapsed. Now we mark them 
<A NAME="915"></A>by judging that A and B are different, and that some third thing is intermediate 
<A NAME="916"></A>to them. When we think of the extremes as different from the middle and 
<A NAME="917"></A>the mind pronounces that the 'nows' are two, one before and one after, 
<A NAME="918"></A>it is then that we say that there is time, and this that we say is time. 
<A NAME="919"></A>For what is bounded by the 'now' is thought to be time-we may assume 
<A NAME="920"></A>this.
<A NAME="921"></A><BR><BR>When, therefore, we perceive the 'now' one, and neither as before 
<A NAME="922"></A>and after in a motion nor as an identity but in relation to a 'before' 
<A NAME="923"></A>and an 'after', no time is thought to have elapsed, because there has been 
<A NAME="924"></A>no motion either. On the other hand, when we do perceive a 'before' and 
<A NAME="925"></A>an 'after', then we say that there is time. For time is just this-number 
<A NAME="926"></A>of motion in respect of 'before' and 'after'.
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR>Hence time is not movement, but only movement in so far as it admits 
<A NAME="928"></A>of enumeration. A proof of this: we discriminate the more or the less by 
<A NAME="929"></A>number, but more or less movement by time. Time then is a kind of number. 
<A NAME="930"></A>(Number, we must note, is used in two senses-both of what is counted or 
<A NAME="931"></A>the countable and also of that with which we count. Time obviously is what 
<A NAME="932"></A>is counted, not that with which we count: there are different kinds of 
<A NAME="933"></A>thing.) Just as motion is a perpetual succession, so also is time. But 
<A NAME="934"></A>every simultaneous time is self-identical; for the 'now' as a subject is 
<A NAME="935"></A>an identity, but it accepts different attributes. The 'now' measures time, 
<A NAME="936"></A>in so far as time involves the 'before and after'.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR>The 'now' in one sense is the same, in another it is not the same. 
<A NAME="938"></A>In so far as it is in succession, it is different (which is just what its 
<A NAME="939"></A>being was supposed to mean), but its substratum is an identity: for motion, 
<A NAME="940"></A>as was said, goes with magnitude, and time, as we maintain, with motion. 
<A NAME="941"></A>Similarly, then, there corresponds to the point the body which is carried 
<A NAME="942"></A>along, and by which we are aware of the motion and of the 'before and after' 
<A NAME="943"></A>involved in it. This is an identical substratum (whether a point or a stone 
<A NAME="944"></A>or something else of the kind), but it has different attributes as the 
<A NAME="945"></A>sophists assume that Coriscus' being in the Lyceum is a different thing 
<A NAME="946"></A>from Coriscus' being in the market-place. And the body which is carried 
<A NAME="947"></A>along is different, in so far as it is at one time here and at another 
<A NAME="948"></A>there. But the 'now' corresponds to the body that is carried along, as 
<A NAME="949"></A>time corresponds to the motion. For it is by means of the body that is 
<A NAME="950"></A>carried along that we become aware of the 'before and after' the motion, 
<A NAME="951"></A>and if we regard these as countable we get the 'now'. Hence in these also 
<A NAME="952"></A>the 'now' as substratum remains the same (for it is what is before and 
<A NAME="953"></A>after in movement), but what is predicated of it is different; for it is 
<A NAME="954"></A>in so far as the 'before and after' is numerable that we get the 'now'. 
<A NAME="955"></A>This is what is most knowable: for, similarly, motion is known because 
<A NAME="956"></A>of that which is moved, locomotion because of that which is carried. what 
<A NAME="957"></A>is carried is a real thing, the movement is not. Thus what is called 'now' 
<A NAME="958"></A>in one sense is always the same; in another it is not the same: for this 
<A NAME="959"></A>is true also of what is carried.
<A NAME="960"></A><BR><BR>Clearly, too, if there were no time, there would be no 'now', and 
<A NAME="961"></A>vice versa. just as the moving body and its locomotion involve each other 
<A NAME="962"></A>mutually, so too do the number of the moving body and the number of its 
<A NAME="963"></A>locomotion. For the number of the locomotion is time, while the 'now' corresponds 
<A NAME="964"></A>to the moving body, and is like the unit of number.
<A NAME="965"></A><BR><BR>Time, then, also is both made continuous by the 'now' and divided 
<A NAME="966"></A>at it. For here too there is a correspondence with the locomotion and the 
<A NAME="967"></A>moving body. For the motion or locomotion is made one by the thing which 
<A NAME="968"></A>is moved, because it is one-not because it is one in its own nature (for 
<A NAME="969"></A>there might be pauses in the movement of such a thing)-but because it is 
<A NAME="970"></A>one in definition: for this determines the movement as 'before' and 'after'. 
<A NAME="971"></A>Here, too there is a correspondence with the point; for the point also 
<A NAME="972"></A>both connects and terminates the length-it is the beginning of one and 
<A NAME="973"></A>the end of another. But when you take it in this way, using the one point 
<A NAME="974"></A>as two, a pause is necessary, if the same point is to be the beginning 
<A NAME="975"></A>and the end. The 'now' on the other hand, since the body carried is moving, 
<A NAME="976"></A>is always different.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR><BR>Hence time is not number in the sense in which there is 'number' 
<A NAME="978"></A>of the same point because it is beginning and end, but rather as the extremities 
<A NAME="979"></A>of a line form a number, and not as the parts of the line do so, both for 
<A NAME="980"></A>the reason given (for we can use the middle point as two, so that on that 
<A NAME="981"></A>analogy time might stand still), and further because obviously the 'now' 
<A NAME="982"></A>is no part of time nor the section any part of the movement, any more than 
<A NAME="983"></A>the points are parts of the line-for it is two lines that are parts of 
<A NAME="984"></A>one line.
<A NAME="985"></A><BR><BR>In so far then as the 'now' is a boundary, it is not time, but 
<A NAME="986"></A>an attribute of it; in so far as it numbers, it is number; for boundaries 
<A NAME="987"></A>belong only to that which they bound, but number (e.g. ten) is the number 
<A NAME="988"></A>of these horses, and belongs also elsewhere.
<A NAME="989"></A><BR><BR>It is clear, then, that time is 'number of movement in respect 
<A NAME="990"></A>of the before and after', and is continuous since it is an attribute of 
<A NAME="991"></A>what is continuous.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="992"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="993"></A><BR><BR>The smallest number, in the strict sense of the word 'number', 
<A NAME="994"></A>is two. But of number as concrete, sometimes there is a minimum, sometimes 
<A NAME="995"></A>not: e.g. of a 'line', the smallest in respect of multiplicity is two (or, 
<A NAME="996"></A>if you like, one), but in respect of size there is no minimum; for every 
<A NAME="997"></A>line is divided ad infinitum. Hence it is so with time. In respect of number 
<A NAME="998"></A>the minimum is one (or two); in point of extent there is no 
<A NAME="999"></A>minimum.
<A NAME="1000"></A><BR><BR>It is clear, too, that time is not described as fast or slow, but 
<A NAME="1001"></A>as many or few and as long or short. For as continuous it is long or short 
<A NAME="1002"></A>and as a number many or few, but it is not fast or slow-any more than any 
<A NAME="1003"></A>number with which we number is fast or slow.
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR><BR>Further, there is the same time everywhere at once, but not the 
<A NAME="1005"></A>same time before and after, for while the present change is one, the change 
<A NAME="1006"></A>which has happened and that which will happen are different. Time is not 
<A NAME="1007"></A>number with which we count, but the number of things which are counted, 
<A NAME="1008"></A>and this according as it occurs before or after is always different, for 
<A NAME="1009"></A>the 'nows' are different. And the number of a hundred horses and a hundred 
<A NAME="1010"></A>men is the same, but the things numbered are different-the horses from 
<A NAME="1011"></A>the men. Further, as a movement can be one and the same again and again, 
<A NAME="1012"></A>so too can time, e.g. a year or a spring or an autumn.
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR><BR>Not only do we measure the movement by the time, but also the time 
<A NAME="1014"></A>by the movement, because they define each other. The time marks the movement, 
<A NAME="1015"></A>since it is its number, and the movement the time. We describe the time 
<A NAME="1016"></A>as much or little, measuring it by the movement, just as we know the number 
<A NAME="1017"></A>by what is numbered, e.g. the number of the horses by one horse as the 
<A NAME="1018"></A>unit. For we know how many horses there are by the use of the number; and 
<A NAME="1019"></A>again by using the one horse as unit we know the number of the horses itself. 
<A NAME="1020"></A>So it is with the time and the movement; for we measure the movement by 
<A NAME="1021"></A>the time and vice versa. It is natural that this should happen; for the 
<A NAME="1022"></A>movement goes with the distance and the time with the movement, because 
<A NAME="1023"></A>they are quanta and continuous and divisible. The movement has these attributes 
<A NAME="1024"></A>because the distance is of this nature, and the time has them because of 
<A NAME="1025"></A>the movement. And we measure both the distance by the movement and the 
<A NAME="1026"></A>movement by the distance; for we say that the road is long, if the journey 
<A NAME="1027"></A>is long, and that this is long, if the road is long-the time, too, if the 
<A NAME="1028"></A>movement, and the movement, if the time.
<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR>Time is a measure of motion and of being moved, and it measures 
<A NAME="1030"></A>the motion by determining a motion which will measure exactly the whole 
<A NAME="1031"></A>motion, as the cubit does the length by determining an amount which will 
<A NAME="1032"></A>measure out the whole. Further 'to be in time' means for movement, that 
<A NAME="1033"></A>both it and its essence are measured by time (for simultaneously it measures 
<A NAME="1034"></A>both the movement and its essence, and this is what being in time means 
<A NAME="1035"></A>for it, that its essence should be measured).
<A NAME="1036"></A><BR><BR>Clearly then 'to be in time' has the same meaning for other things 
<A NAME="1037"></A>also, namely, that their being should be measured by time. 'To be in time' 
<A NAME="1038"></A>is one of two things: (1) to exist when time exists, (2) as we say of some 
<A NAME="1039"></A>things that they are 'in number'. The latter means either what is a part 
<A NAME="1040"></A>or mode of number-in general, something which belongs to number-or that 
<A NAME="1041"></A>things have a number.
<A NAME="1042"></A><BR><BR>Now, since time is number, the 'now' and the 'before' and the like 
<A NAME="1043"></A>are in time, just as 'unit' and 'odd' and 'even' are in number, i.e. in 
<A NAME="1044"></A>the sense that the one set belongs to number, the other to time. But things 
<A NAME="1045"></A>are in time as they are in number. If this is so, they are contained by 
<A NAME="1046"></A>time as things in place are contained by place.
<A NAME="1047"></A><BR><BR>Plainly, too, to be in time does not mean to co-exist with time, 
<A NAME="1048"></A>any more than to be in motion or in place means to co-exist with motion 
<A NAME="1049"></A>or place. For if 'to be in something' is to mean this, then all things 
<A NAME="1050"></A>will be in anything, and the heaven will be in a grain; for when the grain 
<A NAME="1051"></A>is, then also is the heaven. But this is a merely incidental conjunction, 
<A NAME="1052"></A>whereas the other is necessarily involved: that which is in time necessarily 
<A NAME="1053"></A>involves that there is time when it is, and that which is in motion that 
<A NAME="1054"></A>there is motion when it is.
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR><BR>Since what is 'in time' is so in the same sense as what is in number 
<A NAME="1056"></A>is so, a time greater than everything in time can be found. So it is necessary 
<A NAME="1057"></A>that all the things in time should be contained by time, just like other 
<A NAME="1058"></A>things also which are 'in anything', e.g. the things 'in place' by 
<A NAME="1059"></A>place.
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR><BR>A thing, then, will be affected by time, just as we are accustomed 
<A NAME="1061"></A>to say that time wastes things away, and that all things grow old through 
<A NAME="1062"></A>time, and that there is oblivion owing to the lapse of time, but we do 
<A NAME="1063"></A>not say the same of getting to know or of becoming young or fair. For time 
<A NAME="1064"></A>is by its nature the cause rather of decay, since it is the number of change, 
<A NAME="1065"></A>and change removes what is.
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR><BR>Hence, plainly, things which are always are not, as such, in time, 
<A NAME="1067"></A>for they are not contained time, nor is their being measured by time. A 
<A NAME="1068"></A>proof of this is that none of them is affected by time, which indicates 
<A NAME="1069"></A>that they are not in time.
<A NAME="1070"></A><BR><BR>Since time is the measure of motion, it will be the measure of 
<A NAME="1071"></A>rest too-indirectly. For all rest is in time. For it does not follow that 
<A NAME="1072"></A>what is in time is moved, though what is in motion is necessarily moved. 
<A NAME="1073"></A>For time is not motion, but 'number of motion': and what is at rest, also, 
<A NAME="1074"></A>can be in the number of motion. Not everything that is not in motion can 
<A NAME="1075"></A>be said to be 'at rest'-but only that which can be moved, though it actually 
<A NAME="1076"></A>is not moved, as was said above.
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR><BR>'To be in number' means that there is a number of the thing, and 
<A NAME="1078"></A>that its being is measured by the number in which it is. Hence if a thing 
<A NAME="1079"></A>is 'in time' it will be measured by time. But time will measure what is 
<A NAME="1080"></A>moved and what is at rest, the one qua moved, the other qua at rest; for 
<A NAME="1081"></A>it will measure their motion and rest respectively.
<A NAME="1082"></A><BR><BR>Hence what is moved will not be measurable by the time simply in 
<A NAME="1083"></A>so far as it has quantity, but in so far as its motion has quantity. Thus 
<A NAME="1084"></A>none of the things which are neither moved nor at rest are in time: for 
<A NAME="1085"></A>'to be in time' is 'to be measured by time', while time is the measure 
<A NAME="1086"></A>of motion and rest.
<A NAME="1087"></A><BR><BR>Plainly, then, neither will everything that does not exist be in 
<A NAME="1088"></A>time, i.e. those non-existent things that cannot exist, as the diagonal 
<A NAME="1089"></A>cannot be commensurate with the side.
<A NAME="1090"></A><BR><BR>Generally, if time is directly the measure of motion and indirectly 
<A NAME="1091"></A>of other things, it is clear that a thing whose existence is measured by 
<A NAME="1092"></A>it will have its existence in rest or motion. Those things therefore which 
<A NAME="1093"></A>are subject to perishing and becoming-generally, those which at one time 
<A NAME="1094"></A>exist, at another do not-are necessarily in time: for there is a greater 
<A NAME="1095"></A>time which will extend both beyond their existence and beyond the time 
<A NAME="1096"></A>which measures their existence. Of things which do not exist but are contained 
<A NAME="1097"></A>by time some were, e.g. Homer once was, some will be, e.g. a future event; 
<A NAME="1098"></A>this depends on the direction in which time contains them; if on both, 
<A NAME="1099"></A>they have both modes of existence. As to such things as it does not contain 
<A NAME="1100"></A>in any way, they neither were nor are nor will be. These are those nonexistents 
<A NAME="1101"></A>whose opposites always are, as the incommensurability of the diagonal always 
<A NAME="1102"></A>is-and this will not be in time. Nor will the commensurability, therefore; 
<A NAME="1103"></A>hence this eternally is not, because it is contrary to what eternally is. 
<A NAME="1104"></A>A thing whose contrary is not eternal can be and not be, and it is of such 
<A NAME="1105"></A>things that there is coming to be and passing away.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1106"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="1107"></A><BR><BR>The 'now' is the link of time, as has been said (for it connects 
<A NAME="1108"></A>past and future time), and it is a limit of time (for it is the beginning 
<A NAME="1109"></A>of the one and the end of the other). But this is not obvious as it is 
<A NAME="1110"></A>with the point, which is fixed. It divides potentially, and in so far as 
<A NAME="1111"></A>it is dividing the 'now' is always different, but in so far as it connects 
<A NAME="1112"></A>it is always the same, as it is with mathematical lines. For the intellect 
<A NAME="1113"></A>it is not always one and the same point, since it is other and other when 
<A NAME="1114"></A>one divides the line; but in so far as it is one, it is the same in every 
<A NAME="1115"></A>respect.
<A NAME="1116"></A><BR><BR>So the 'now' also is in one way a potential dividing of time, in 
<A NAME="1117"></A>another the termination of both parts, and their unity. And the dividing 
<A NAME="1118"></A>and the uniting are the same thing and in the same reference, but in essence 
<A NAME="1119"></A>they are not the same.
<A NAME="1120"></A><BR><BR>So one kind of 'now' is described in this way: another is when 
<A NAME="1121"></A>the time is near this kind of 'now'. 'He will come now' because he will 
<A NAME="1122"></A>come to-day; 'he has come now' because he came to-day. But the things in 
<A NAME="1123"></A>the Iliad have not happened 'now', nor is the flood 'now'-not that the 
<A NAME="1124"></A>time from now to them is not continuous, but because they are not 
<A NAME="1125"></A>near.
<A NAME="1126"></A><BR><BR>'At some time' means a time determined in relation to the first 
<A NAME="1127"></A>of the two types of 'now', e.g. 'at some time' Troy was taken, and 'at 
<A NAME="1128"></A>some time' there will be a flood; for it must be determined with reference 
<A NAME="1129"></A>to the 'now'. There will thus be a determinate time from this 'now' to 
<A NAME="1130"></A>that, and there was such in reference to the past event. But if there be 
<A NAME="1131"></A>no time which is not 'sometime', every time will be 
<A NAME="1132"></A>determined.
<A NAME="1133"></A><BR><BR>Will time then fail? Surely not, if motion always exists. Is time 
<A NAME="1134"></A>then always different or does the same time recur? Clearly time is, in 
<A NAME="1135"></A>the same way as motion is. For if one and the same motion sometimes recurs, 
<A NAME="1136"></A>it will be one and the same time, and if not, not.
<A NAME="1137"></A><BR><BR>Since the 'now' is an end and a beginning of time, not of the same 
<A NAME="1138"></A>time however, but the end of that which is past and the beginning of that 
<A NAME="1139"></A>which is to come, it follows that, as the circle has its convexity and 
<A NAME="1140"></A>its concavity, in a sense, in the same thing, so time is always at a beginning 
<A NAME="1141"></A>and at an end. And for this reason it seems to be always different; for 
<A NAME="1142"></A>the 'now' is not the beginning and the end of the same thing; if it were, 
<A NAME="1143"></A>it would be at the same time and in the same respect two opposites. And 
<A NAME="1144"></A>time will not fail; for it is always at a beginning.
<A NAME="1145"></A><BR><BR>'Presently' or 'just' refers to the part of future time which is 
<A NAME="1146"></A>near the indivisible present 'now' ('When do you walk? 'Presently', because 
<A NAME="1147"></A>the time in which he is going to do so is near), and to the part of past 
<A NAME="1148"></A>time which is not far from the 'now' ('When do you walk?' 'I have just 
<A NAME="1149"></A>been walking'). But to say that Troy has just been taken-we do not say 
<A NAME="1150"></A>that, because it is too far from the 'now'. 'Lately', too, refers to the 
<A NAME="1151"></A>part of past time which is near the present 'now'. 'When did you go?' 'Lately', 
<A NAME="1152"></A>if the time is near the existing now. 'Long ago' refers to the distant 
<A NAME="1153"></A>past.
