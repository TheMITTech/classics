<A NAME="10"></A>1
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Since virtue is concerned with passions and actions, and on voluntary 
<A NAME="12"></A>passions and actions praise and blame are bestowed, on those that are involuntary 
<A NAME="13"></A>pardon, and sometimes also pity, to distinguish the voluntary and the involuntary 
<A NAME="14"></A>is presumably necessary for those who are studying the nature of virtue, 
<A NAME="15"></A>and useful also for legislators with a view to the assigning both of honours 
<A NAME="16"></A>and of punishments. Those things, then, are thought-involuntary, which 
<A NAME="17"></A>take place under compulsion or owing to ignorance; and that is compulsory 
<A NAME="18"></A>of which the moving principle is outside, being a principle in which nothing 
<A NAME="19"></A>is contributed by the person who is acting or is feeling the passion, e.g. 
<A NAME="20"></A>if he were to be carried somewhere by a wind, or by men who had him in 
<A NAME="21"></A>their power.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>But with regard to the things that are done from fear of greater 
<A NAME="23"></A>evils or for some noble object (e.g. if a tyrant were to order one to do 
<A NAME="24"></A>something base, having one's parents and children in his power, and if 
<A NAME="25"></A>one did the action they were to be saved, but otherwise would be put to 
<A NAME="26"></A>death), it may be debated whether such actions are involuntary or voluntary. 
<A NAME="27"></A>Something of the sort happens also with regard to the throwing of goods 
<A NAME="28"></A>overboard in a storm; for in the abstract no one throws goods away voluntarily, 
<A NAME="29"></A>but on condition of its securing the safety of himself and his crew any 
<A NAME="30"></A>sensible man does so. Such actions, then, are mixed, but are more like 
<A NAME="31"></A>voluntary actions; for they are worthy of choice at the time when they 
<A NAME="32"></A>are done, and the end of an action is relative to the occasion. Both the 
<A NAME="33"></A>terms, then, 'voluntary' and 'involuntary', must be used with reference 
<A NAME="34"></A>to the moment of action. Now the man acts voluntarily; for the principle 
<A NAME="35"></A>that moves the instrumental parts of the body in such actions is in him, 
<A NAME="36"></A>and the things of which the moving principle is in a man himself are in 
<A NAME="37"></A>his power to do or not to do. Such actions, therefore, are voluntary, but 
<A NAME="38"></A>in the abstract perhaps involuntary; for no one would choose any such act 
<A NAME="39"></A>in itself.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>For such actions men are sometimes even praised, when they endure 
<A NAME="41"></A>something base or painful in return for great and noble objects gained; 
<A NAME="42"></A>in the opposite case they are blamed, since to endure the greatest indignities 
<A NAME="43"></A>for no noble end or for a trifling end is the mark of an inferior person. 
<A NAME="44"></A>On some actions praise indeed is not bestowed, but pardon is, when one 
<A NAME="45"></A>does what he ought not under pressure which overstrains human nature and 
<A NAME="46"></A>which no one could withstand. But some acts, perhaps, we cannot be forced 
<A NAME="47"></A>to do, but ought rather to face death after the most fearful sufferings; 
<A NAME="48"></A>for the things that 'forced' Euripides Alcmaeon to slay his mother seem 
<A NAME="49"></A>absurd. It is difficult sometimes to determine what should be chosen at 
<A NAME="50"></A>what cost, and what should be endured in return for what gain, and yet 
<A NAME="51"></A>more difficult to abide by our decisions; for as a rule what is expected 
<A NAME="52"></A>is painful, and what we are forced to do is base, whence praise and blame 
<A NAME="53"></A>are bestowed on those who have been compelled or have 
<A NAME="54"></A>not.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>What sort of acts, then, should be called compulsory? We answer 
<A NAME="56"></A>that without qualification actions are so when the cause is in the external 
<A NAME="57"></A>circumstances and the agent contributes nothing. But the things that in 
<A NAME="58"></A>themselves are involuntary, but now and in return for these gains are worthy 
<A NAME="59"></A>of choice, and whose moving principle is in the agent, are in themselves 
<A NAME="60"></A>involuntary, but now and in return for these gains voluntary. They are 
<A NAME="61"></A>more like voluntary acts; for actions are in the class of particulars, 
<A NAME="62"></A>and the particular acts here are voluntary. What sort of things are to 
<A NAME="63"></A>be chosen, and in return for what, it is not easy to state; for there are 
<A NAME="64"></A>many differences in the particular cases.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>But if some one were to say that pleasant and noble objects have 
<A NAME="66"></A>a compelling power, forcing us from without, all acts would be for him 
<A NAME="67"></A>compulsory; for it is for these objects that all men do everything they 
<A NAME="68"></A>do. And those who act under compulsion and unwillingly act with pain, but 
<A NAME="69"></A>those who do acts for their pleasantness and nobility do them with pleasure; 
<A NAME="70"></A>it is absurd to make external circumstances responsible, and not oneself, 
<A NAME="71"></A>as being easily caught by such attractions, and to make oneself responsible 
<A NAME="72"></A>for noble acts but the pleasant objects responsible for base acts. The 
<A NAME="73"></A>compulsory, then, seems to be that whose moving principle is outside, the 
<A NAME="74"></A>person compelled contributing nothing.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>Everything that is done by reason of ignorance is not voluntary; 
<A NAME="76"></A>it is only what produces pain and repentance that is involuntary. For the 
<A NAME="77"></A>man who has done something owing to ignorance, and feels not the least 
<A NAME="78"></A>vexation at his action, has not acted voluntarily, since he did not know 
<A NAME="79"></A>what he was doing, nor yet involuntarily, since he is not pained. Of people, 
<A NAME="80"></A>then, who act by reason of ignorance he who repents is thought an involuntary 
<A NAME="81"></A>agent, and the man who does not repent may, since he is different, be called 
<A NAME="82"></A>a not voluntary agent; for, since he differs from the other, it is better 
<A NAME="83"></A>that he should have a name of his own.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>Acting by reason of ignorance seems also to be different from acting 
<A NAME="85"></A>in ignorance; for the man who is drunk or in a rage is thought to act as 
<A NAME="86"></A>a result not of ignorance but of one of the causes mentioned, yet not knowingly 
<A NAME="87"></A>but in ignorance.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>Now every wicked man is ignorant of what he ought to do and what 
<A NAME="89"></A>he ought to abstain from, and it is by reason of error of this kind that 
<A NAME="90"></A>men become unjust and in general bad; but the term 'involuntary' tends 
<A NAME="91"></A>to be used not if a man is ignorant of what is to his advantage- for it 
<A NAME="92"></A>is not mistaken purpose that causes involuntary action (it leads rather 
<A NAME="93"></A>to wickedness), nor ignorance of the universal (for that men are blamed), 
<A NAME="94"></A>but ignorance of particulars, i.e. of the circumstances of the action and 
<A NAME="95"></A>the objects with which it is concerned. For it is on these that both pity 
<A NAME="96"></A>and pardon depend, since the person who is ignorant of any of these acts 
<A NAME="97"></A>involuntarily.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps it is just as well, therefore, to determine their nature 
<A NAME="99"></A>and number. A man may be ignorant, then, of who he is, what he is doing, 
<A NAME="100"></A>what or whom he is acting on, and sometimes also what (e.g. what instrument) 
<A NAME="101"></A>he is doing it with, and to what end (e.g. he may think his act will conduce 
<A NAME="102"></A>to some one's safety), and how he is doing it (e.g. whether gently or violently). 
<A NAME="103"></A>Now of all of these no one could be ignorant unless he were mad, and evidently 
<A NAME="104"></A>also he could not be ignorant of the agent; for how could he not know himself? 
<A NAME="105"></A>But of what he is doing a man might be ignorant, as for instance people 
<A NAME="106"></A>say 'it slipped out of their mouths as they were speaking', or 'they did 
<A NAME="107"></A>not know it was a secret', as Aeschylus said of the mysteries, or a man 
<A NAME="108"></A>might say he 'let it go off when he merely wanted to show its working', 
<A NAME="109"></A>as the man did with the catapult. Again, one might think one's son was 
<A NAME="110"></A>an enemy, as Merope did, or that a pointed spear had a button on it, or 
<A NAME="111"></A>that a stone was pumicestone; or one might give a man a draught to save 
<A NAME="112"></A>him, and really kill him; or one might want to touch a man, as people do 
<A NAME="113"></A>in sparring, and really wound him. The ignorance may relate, then, to any 
<A NAME="114"></A>of these things, i.e. of the circumstances of the action, and the man who 
<A NAME="115"></A>was ignorant of any of these is thought to have acted involuntarily, and 
<A NAME="116"></A>especially if he was ignorant on the most important points; and these are 
<A NAME="117"></A>thought to be the circumstances of the action and its end. Further, the 
<A NAME="118"></A>doing of an act that is called involuntary in virtue of ignorance of this 
<A NAME="119"></A>sort must be painful and involve repentance.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>Since that which is done under compulsion or by reason of ignorance 
<A NAME="121"></A>is involuntary, the voluntary would seem to be that of which the moving 
<A NAME="122"></A>principle is in the agent himself, he being aware of the particular circumstances 
<A NAME="123"></A>of the action. Presumably acts done by reason of anger or appetite are 
<A NAME="124"></A>not rightly called involuntary. For in the first place, on that showing 
<A NAME="125"></A>none of the other animals will act voluntarily, nor will children; and 
<A NAME="126"></A>secondly, is it meant that we do not do voluntarily any of the acts that 
<A NAME="127"></A>are due to appetite or anger, or that we do the noble acts voluntarily 
<A NAME="128"></A>and the base acts involuntarily? Is not this absurd, when one and the same 
<A NAME="129"></A>thing is the cause? But it would surely be odd to describe as involuntary 
<A NAME="130"></A>the things one ought to desire; and we ought both to be angry at certain 
<A NAME="131"></A>things and to have an appetite for certain things, e.g. for health and 
<A NAME="132"></A>for learning. Also what is involuntary is thought to be painful, but what 
<A NAME="133"></A>is in accordance with appetite is thought to be pleasant. Again, what is 
<A NAME="134"></A>the difference in respect of involuntariness between errors committed upon 
<A NAME="135"></A>calculation and those committed in anger? Both are to be avoided, but the 
<A NAME="136"></A>irrational passions are thought not less human than reason is, and therefore 
<A NAME="137"></A>also the actions which proceed from anger or appetite are the man's actions. 
<A NAME="138"></A>It would be odd, then, to treat them as involuntary.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>2
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>Both the voluntary and the involuntary having been delimited, we 
<A NAME="141"></A>must next discuss choice; for it is thought to be most closely bound up 
<A NAME="142"></A>with virtue and to discriminate characters better than actions 
<A NAME="143"></A>do.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>Choice, then, seems to be voluntary, but not the same thing as 
<A NAME="145"></A>the voluntary; the latter extends more widely. For both children and the 
<A NAME="146"></A>lower animals share in voluntary action, but not in choice, and acts done 
<A NAME="147"></A>on the spur of the moment we describe as voluntary, but not as 
<A NAME="148"></A>chosen.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>Those who say it is appetite or anger or wish or a kind of opinion 
<A NAME="150"></A>do not seem to be right. For choice is not common to irrational creatures 
<A NAME="151"></A>as well, but appetite and anger are. Again, the incontinent man acts with 
<A NAME="152"></A>appetite, but not with choice; while the continent man on the contrary 
<A NAME="153"></A>acts with choice, but not with appetite. Again, appetite is contrary to 
<A NAME="154"></A>choice, but not appetite to appetite. Again, appetite relates to the pleasant 
<A NAME="155"></A>and the painful, choice neither to the painful nor to the 
<A NAME="156"></A>pleasant.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Still less is it anger; for acts due to anger are thought to be 
<A NAME="158"></A>less than any others objects of choice.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>But neither is it wish, though it seems near to it; for choice 
<A NAME="160"></A>cannot relate to impossibles, and if any one said he chose them he would 
<A NAME="161"></A>be thought silly; but there may be a wish even for impossibles, e.g. for 
<A NAME="162"></A>immortality. And wish may relate to things that could in no way be brought 
<A NAME="163"></A>about by one's own efforts, e.g. that a particular actor or athlete should 
<A NAME="164"></A>win in a competition; but no one chooses such things, but only the things 
<A NAME="165"></A>that he thinks could be brought about by his own efforts. Again, wish relates 
<A NAME="166"></A>rather to the end, choice to the means; for instance, we wish to be healthy, 
<A NAME="167"></A>but we choose the acts which will make us healthy, and we wish to be happy 
<A NAME="168"></A>and say we do, but we cannot well say we choose to be so; for, in general, 
<A NAME="169"></A>choice seems to relate to the things that are in our own 
<A NAME="170"></A>power.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>For this reason, too, it cannot be opinion; for opinion is thought 
<A NAME="172"></A>to relate to all kinds of things, no less to eternal things and impossible 
<A NAME="173"></A>things than to things in our own power; and it is distinguished by its 
<A NAME="174"></A>falsity or truth, not by its badness or goodness, while choice is distinguished 
<A NAME="175"></A>rather by these.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>Now with opinion in general perhaps no one even says it is identical. 
<A NAME="177"></A>But it is not identical even with any kind of opinion; for by choosing 
<A NAME="178"></A>what is good or bad we are men of a certain character, which we are not 
<A NAME="179"></A>by holding certain opinions. And we choose to get or avoid something good 
<A NAME="180"></A>or bad, but we have opinions about what a thing is or whom it is good for 
<A NAME="181"></A>or how it is good for him; we can hardly be said to opine to get or avoid 
<A NAME="182"></A>anything. And choice is praised for being related to the right object rather 
<A NAME="183"></A>than for being rightly related to it, opinion for being truly related to 
<A NAME="184"></A>its object. And we choose what we best know to be good, but we opine what 
<A NAME="185"></A>we do not quite know; and it is not the same people that are thought to 
<A NAME="186"></A>make the best choices and to have the best opinions, but some are thought 
<A NAME="187"></A>to have fairly good opinions, but by reason of vice to choose what they 
<A NAME="188"></A>should not. If opinion precedes choice or accompanies it, that makes no 
<A NAME="189"></A>difference; for it is not this that we are considering, but whether it 
<A NAME="190"></A>is identical with some kind of opinion.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>What, then, or what kind of thing is it, since it is none of the 
<A NAME="192"></A>things we have mentioned? It seems to be voluntary, but not all that is 
<A NAME="193"></A>voluntary to be an object of choice. Is it, then, what has been decided 
<A NAME="194"></A>on by previous deliberation? At any rate choice involves a rational principle 
<A NAME="195"></A>and thought. Even the name seems to suggest that it is what is chosen before 
<A NAME="196"></A>other things.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>3
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>Do we deliberate about everything, and is everything a possible 
<A NAME="199"></A>subject of deliberation, or is deliberation impossible about some things? 
<A NAME="200"></A>We ought presumably to call not what a fool or a madman would deliberate 
<A NAME="201"></A>about, but what a sensible man would deliberate about, a subject of deliberation. 
<A NAME="202"></A>Now about eternal things no one deliberates, e.g. about the material universe 
<A NAME="203"></A>or the incommensurability of the diagonal and the side of a square. But 
<A NAME="204"></A>no more do we deliberate about the things that involve movement but always 
<A NAME="205"></A>happen in the same way, whether of necessity or by nature or from any other 
<A NAME="206"></A>cause, e.g. the solstices and the risings of the stars; nor about things 
<A NAME="207"></A>that happen now in one way, now in another, e.g. droughts and rains; nor 
<A NAME="208"></A>about chance events, like the finding of treasure. But we do not deliberate 
<A NAME="209"></A>even about all human affairs; for instance, no Spartan deliberates about 
<A NAME="210"></A>the best constitution for the Scythians. For none of these things can be 
<A NAME="211"></A>brought about by our own efforts.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>We deliberate about things that are in our power and can be done; 
<A NAME="213"></A>and these are in fact what is left. For nature, necessity, and chance are 
<A NAME="214"></A>thought to be causes, and also reason and everything that depends on man. 
<A NAME="215"></A>Now every class of men deliberates about the things that can be done by 
<A NAME="216"></A>their own efforts. And in the case of exact and self-contained sciences 
<A NAME="217"></A>there is no deliberation, e.g. about the letters of the alphabet (for we 
<A NAME="218"></A>have no doubt how they should be written); but the things that are brought 
<A NAME="219"></A>about by our own efforts, but not always in the same way, are the things 
<A NAME="220"></A>about which we deliberate, e.g. questions of medical treatment or of money-making. 
<A NAME="221"></A>And we do so more in the case of the art of navigation than in that of 
<A NAME="222"></A>gymnastics, inasmuch as it has been less exactly worked out, and again 
<A NAME="223"></A>about other things in the same ratio, and more also in the case of the 
<A NAME="224"></A>arts than in that of the sciences; for we have more doubt about the former. 
<A NAME="225"></A>Deliberation is concerned with things that happen in a certain way for 
<A NAME="226"></A>the most part, but in which the event is obscure, and with things in which 
<A NAME="227"></A>it is indeterminate. We call in others to aid us in deliberation on important 
<A NAME="228"></A>questions, distrusting ourselves as not being equal to 
<A NAME="229"></A>deciding.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>We deliberate not about ends but about means. For a doctor does 
<A NAME="231"></A>not deliberate whether he shall heal, nor an orator whether he shall persuade, 
<A NAME="232"></A>nor a statesman whether he shall produce law and order, nor does any one 
<A NAME="233"></A>else deliberate about his end. They assume the end and consider how and 
<A NAME="234"></A>by what means it is to be attained; and if it seems to be produced by several 
<A NAME="235"></A>means they consider by which it is most easily and best produced, while 
<A NAME="236"></A>if it is achieved by one only they consider how it will be achieved by 
<A NAME="237"></A>this and by what means this will be achieved, till they come to the first 
<A NAME="238"></A>cause, which in the order of discovery is last. For the person who deliberates 
<A NAME="239"></A>seems to investigate and analyse in the way described as though he were 
<A NAME="240"></A>analysing a geometrical construction (not all investigation appears to 
<A NAME="241"></A>be deliberation- for instance mathematical investigations- but all deliberation 
<A NAME="242"></A>is investigation), and what is last in the order of analysis seems to be 
<A NAME="243"></A>first in the order of becoming. And if we come on an impossibility, we 
<A NAME="244"></A>give up the search, e.g. if we need money and this cannot be got; but if 
<A NAME="245"></A>a thing appears possible we try to do it. By 'possible' things I mean things 
<A NAME="246"></A>that might be brought about by our own efforts; and these in a sense include 
<A NAME="247"></A>things that can be brought about by the efforts of our friends, since the 
<A NAME="248"></A>moving principle is in ourselves. The subject of investigation is sometimes 
<A NAME="249"></A>the instruments, sometimes the use of them; and similarly in the other 
<A NAME="250"></A>cases- sometimes the means, sometimes the mode of using it or the means 
<A NAME="251"></A>of bringing it about. It seems, then, as has been said, that man is a moving 
<A NAME="252"></A>principle of actions; now deliberation is about the things to be done by 
<A NAME="253"></A>the agent himself, and actions are for the sake of things other than themselves. 
<A NAME="254"></A>For the end cannot be a subject of deliberation, but only the means; nor 
<A NAME="255"></A>indeed can the particular facts be a subject of it, as whether this is 
<A NAME="256"></A>bread or has been baked as it should; for these are matters of perception. 
<A NAME="257"></A>If we are to be always deliberating, we shall have to go on to 
<A NAME="258"></A>infinity.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>The same thing is deliberated upon and is chosen, except that the 
<A NAME="260"></A>object of choice is already determinate, since it is that which has been 
<A NAME="261"></A>decided upon as a result of deliberation that is the object of choice. 
<A NAME="262"></A>For every one ceases to inquire how he is to act when he has brought the 
<A NAME="263"></A>moving principle back to himself and to the ruling part of himself; for 
<A NAME="264"></A>this is what chooses. This is plain also from the ancient constitutions, 
<A NAME="265"></A>which Homer represented; for the kings announced their choices to the people. 
<A NAME="266"></A>The object of choice being one of the things in our own power which is 
<A NAME="267"></A>desired after deliberation, choice will be deliberate desire of things 
<A NAME="268"></A>in our own power; for when we have decided as a result of deliberation, 
<A NAME="269"></A>we desire in accordance with our deliberation.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>We may take it, then, that we have described choice in outline, 
<A NAME="271"></A>and stated the nature of its objects and the fact that it is concerned 
<A NAME="272"></A>with means.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>4
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>That wish is for the end has already been stated; some think it 
<A NAME="275"></A>is for the good, others for the apparent good. Now those who say that the 
<A NAME="276"></A>good is the object of wish must admit in consequence that that which the 
<A NAME="277"></A>man who does not choose aright wishes for is not an object of wish (for 
<A NAME="278"></A>if it is to be so, it must also be good; but it was, if it so happened, 
<A NAME="279"></A>bad); while those who say the apparent good is the object of wish must 
<A NAME="280"></A>admit that there is no natural object of wish, but only what seems good 
<A NAME="281"></A>to each man. Now different things appear good to different people, and, 
<A NAME="282"></A>if it so happens, even contrary things.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>If these consequences are unpleasing, are we to say that absolutely 
<A NAME="284"></A>and in truth the good is the object of wish, but for each person the apparent 
<A NAME="285"></A>good; that that which is in truth an object of wish is an object of wish 
<A NAME="286"></A>to the good man, while any chance thing may be so the bad man, as in the 
<A NAME="287"></A>case of bodies also the things that are in truth wholesome are wholesome 
<A NAME="288"></A>for bodies which are in good condition, while for those that are diseased 
<A NAME="289"></A>other things are wholesome- or bitter or sweet or hot or heavy, and so 
<A NAME="290"></A>on; since the good man judges each class of things rightly, and in each 
<A NAME="291"></A>the truth appears to him? For each state of character has its own ideas 
<A NAME="292"></A>of the noble and the pleasant, and perhaps the good man differs from others 
<A NAME="293"></A>most by seeing the truth in each class of things, being as it were the 
<A NAME="294"></A>norm and measure of them. In most things the error seems to be due to pleasure; 
<A NAME="295"></A>for it appears a good when it is not. We therefore choose the pleasant 
<A NAME="296"></A>as a good, and avoid pain as an evil.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>5
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>The end, then, being what we wish for, the means what we deliberate 
<A NAME="299"></A>about and choose, actions concerning means must be according to choice 
<A NAME="300"></A>and voluntary. Now the exercise of the virtues is concerned with means. 
<A NAME="301"></A>Therefore virtue also is in our own power, and so too vice. For where it 
<A NAME="302"></A>is in our power to act it is also in our power not to act, and vice versa; 
<A NAME="303"></A>so that, if to act, where this is noble, is in our power, not to act, which 
<A NAME="304"></A>will be base, will also be in our power, and if not to act, where this 
<A NAME="305"></A>is noble, is in our power, to act, which will be base, will also be in 
<A NAME="306"></A>our power. Now if it is in our power to do noble or base acts, and likewise 
<A NAME="307"></A>in our power not to do them, and this was what being good or bad meant, 
<A NAME="308"></A>then it is in our power to be virtuous or vicious.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>The saying that 'no one is voluntarily wicked nor involuntarily 
<A NAME="310"></A>happy' seems to be partly false and partly true; for no one is involuntarily 
<A NAME="311"></A>happy, but wickedness is voluntary. Or else we shall have to dispute what 
<A NAME="312"></A>has just been said, at any rate, and deny that man is a moving principle 
<A NAME="313"></A>or begetter of his actions as of children. But if these facts are evident 
<A NAME="314"></A>and we cannot refer actions to moving principles other than those in ourselves, 
<A NAME="315"></A>the acts whose moving principles are in us must themselves also be in our 
<A NAME="316"></A>power and voluntary.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>Witness seems to be borne to this both by individuals in their 
<A NAME="318"></A>private capacity and by legislators themselves; for these punish and take 
<A NAME="319"></A>vengeance on those who do wicked acts (unless they have acted under compulsion 
<A NAME="320"></A>or as a result of ignorance for which they are not themselves responsible), 
<A NAME="321"></A>while they honour those who do noble acts, as though they meant to encourage 
<A NAME="322"></A>the latter and deter the former. But no one is encouraged to do the things 
<A NAME="323"></A>that are neither in our power nor voluntary; it is assumed that there is 
<A NAME="324"></A>no gain in being persuaded not to be hot or in pain or hungry or the like, 
<A NAME="325"></A>since we shall experience these feelings none the less. Indeed, we punish 
<A NAME="326"></A>a man for his very ignorance, if he is thought responsible for the ignorance, 
<A NAME="327"></A>as when penalties are doubled in the case of drunkenness; for the moving 
<A NAME="328"></A>principle is in the man himself, since he had the power of not getting 
<A NAME="329"></A>drunk and his getting drunk was the cause of his ignorance. And we punish 
<A NAME="330"></A>those who are ignorant of anything in the laws that they ought to know 
<A NAME="331"></A>and that is not difficult, and so too in the case of anything else that 
<A NAME="332"></A>they are thought to be ignorant of through carelessness; we assume that 
<A NAME="333"></A>it is in their power not to be ignorant, since they have the power of taking 
<A NAME="334"></A>care.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>But perhaps a man is the kind of man not to take care. Still they 
<A NAME="336"></A>are themselves by their slack lives responsible for becoming men of that 
<A NAME="337"></A>kind, and men make themselves responsible for being unjust or self-indulgent, 
<A NAME="338"></A>in the one case by cheating and in the other by spending their time in 
<A NAME="339"></A>drinking bouts and the like; for it is activities exercised on particular 
<A NAME="340"></A>objects that make the corresponding character. This is plain from the case 
<A NAME="341"></A>of people training for any contest or action; they practise the activity 
<A NAME="342"></A>the whole time. Now not to know that it is from the exercise of activities 
<A NAME="343"></A>on particular objects that states of character are produced is the mark 
<A NAME="344"></A>of a thoroughly senseless person. Again, it is irrational to suppose that 
<A NAME="345"></A>a man who acts unjustly does not wish to be unjust or a man who acts self-indulgently 
<A NAME="346"></A>to be self-indulgent. But if without being ignorant a man does the things 
<A NAME="347"></A>which will make him unjust, he will be unjust voluntarily. Yet it does 
<A NAME="348"></A>not follow that if he wishes he will cease to be unjust and will be just. 
<A NAME="349"></A>For neither does the man who is ill become well on those terms. We may 
<A NAME="350"></A>suppose a case in which he is ill voluntarily, through living incontinently 
<A NAME="351"></A>and disobeying his doctors. In that case it was then open to him not to 
<A NAME="352"></A>be ill, but not now, when he has thrown away his chance, just as when you 
<A NAME="353"></A>have let a stone go it is too late to recover it; but yet it was in your 
<A NAME="354"></A>power to throw it, since the moving principle was in you. So, too, to the 
<A NAME="355"></A>unjust and to the self-indulgent man it was open at the beginning not to 
<A NAME="356"></A>become men of this kind, and so they are unjust and selfindulgent voluntarily; 
<A NAME="357"></A>but now that they have become so it is not possible for them not to be 
<A NAME="358"></A>so.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>But not only are the vices of the soul voluntary, but those of 
<A NAME="360"></A>the body also for some men, whom we accordingly blame; while no one blames 
<A NAME="361"></A>those who are ugly by nature, we blame those who are so owing to want of 
<A NAME="362"></A>exercise and care. So it is, too, with respect to weakness and infirmity; 
<A NAME="363"></A>no one would reproach a man blind from birth or by disease or from a blow, 
<A NAME="364"></A>but rather pity him, while every one would blame a man who was blind from 
<A NAME="365"></A>drunkenness or some other form of self-indulgence. Of vices of the body, 
<A NAME="366"></A>then, those in our own power are blamed, those not in our power are not. 
<A NAME="367"></A>And if this be so, in the other cases also the vices that are blamed must 
<A NAME="368"></A>be in our own power.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>Now some one may say that all men desire the apparent good, but 
<A NAME="370"></A>have no control over the appearance, but the end appears to each man in 
<A NAME="371"></A>a form answering to his character. We reply that if each man is somehow 
<A NAME="372"></A>responsible for his state of mind, he will also be himself somehow responsible 
<A NAME="373"></A>for the appearance; but if not, no one is responsible for his own evildoing, 
<A NAME="374"></A>but every one does evil acts through ignorance of the end, thinking that 
<A NAME="375"></A>by these he will get what is best, and the aiming at the end is not self-chosen 
<A NAME="376"></A>but one must be born with an eye, as it were, by which to judge rightly 
<A NAME="377"></A>and choose what is truly good, and he is well endowed by nature who is 
<A NAME="378"></A>well endowed with this. For it is what is greatest and most noble, and 
<A NAME="379"></A>what we cannot get or learn from another, but must have just such as it 
<A NAME="380"></A>was when given us at birth, and to be well and nobly endowed with this 
<A NAME="381"></A>will be perfect and true excellence of natural endowment. If this is true, 
<A NAME="382"></A>then, how will virtue be more voluntary than vice? To both men alike, the 
<A NAME="383"></A>good and the bad, the end appears and is fixed by nature or however it 
<A NAME="384"></A>may be, and it is by referring everything else to this that men do whatever 
<A NAME="385"></A>they do.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>Whether, then, it is not by nature that the end appears to each 
<A NAME="387"></A>man such as it does appear, but something also depends on him, or the end 
<A NAME="388"></A>is natural but because the good man adopts the means voluntarily virtue 
<A NAME="389"></A>is voluntary, vice also will be none the less voluntary; for in the case 
<A NAME="390"></A>of the bad man there is equally present that which depends on himself in 
<A NAME="391"></A>his actions even if not in his end. If, then, as is asserted, the virtues 
<A NAME="392"></A>are voluntary (for we are ourselves somehow partly responsible for our 
<A NAME="393"></A>states of character, and it is by being persons of a certain kind that 
<A NAME="394"></A>we assume the end to be so and so), the vices also will be voluntary; for 
<A NAME="395"></A>the same is true of them.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>With regard to the virtues in general we have stated their genus 
<A NAME="397"></A>in outline, viz. that they are means and that they are states of character, 
<A NAME="398"></A>and that they tend, and by their own nature, to the doing of the acts by 
<A NAME="399"></A>which they are produced, and that they are in our power and voluntary, 
<A NAME="400"></A>and act as the right rule prescribes. But actions and states of character 
<A NAME="401"></A>are not voluntary in the same way; for we are masters of our actions from 
<A NAME="402"></A>the beginning right to the end, if we know the particular facts, but though 
<A NAME="403"></A>we control the beginning of our states of character the gradual progress 
<A NAME="404"></A>is not obvious any more than it is in illnesses; because it was in our 
<A NAME="405"></A>power, however, to act in this way or not in this way, therefore the states 
<A NAME="406"></A>are voluntary.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>Let us take up the several virtues, however, and say which they 
<A NAME="408"></A>are and what sort of things they are concerned with and how they are concerned 
<A NAME="409"></A>with them; at the same time it will become plain how many they are. And 
<A NAME="410"></A>first let us speak of courage.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>6
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>That it is a mean with regard to feelings of fear and confidence 
<A NAME="413"></A>has already been made evident; and plainly the things we fear are terrible 
<A NAME="414"></A>things, and these are, to speak without qualification, evils; for which 
<A NAME="415"></A>reason people even define fear as expectation of evil. Now we fear all 
<A NAME="416"></A>evils, e.g. disgrace, poverty, disease, friendlessness, death, but the 
<A NAME="417"></A>brave man is not thought to be concerned with all; for to fear some things 
<A NAME="418"></A>is even right and noble, and it is base not to fear them- e.g. disgrace; 
<A NAME="419"></A>he who fears this is good and modest, and he who does not is shameless. 
<A NAME="420"></A>He is, however, by some people called brave, by a transference of the word 
<A NAME="421"></A>to a new meaning; for he has in him something which is like the brave man, 
<A NAME="422"></A>since the brave man also is a fearless person. Poverty and disease we perhaps 
<A NAME="423"></A>ought not to fear, nor in general the things that do not proceed from vice 
<A NAME="424"></A>and are not due to a man himself. But not even the man who is fearless 
<A NAME="425"></A>of these is brave. Yet we apply the word to him also in virtue of a similarity; 
<A NAME="426"></A>for some who in the dangers of war are cowards are liberal and are confident 
<A NAME="427"></A>in face of the loss of money. Nor is a man a coward if he fears insult 
<A NAME="428"></A>to his wife and children or envy or anything of the kind; nor brave if 
<A NAME="429"></A>he is confident when he is about to be flogged. With what sort of terrible 
<A NAME="430"></A>things, then, is the brave man concerned? Surely with the greatest; for 
<A NAME="431"></A>no one is more likely than he to stand his ground against what is awe-inspiring. 
<A NAME="432"></A>Now death is the most terrible of all things; for it is the end, and nothing 
<A NAME="433"></A>is thought to be any longer either good or bad for the dead. But the brave 
<A NAME="434"></A>man would not seem to be concerned even with death in all circumstances, 
<A NAME="435"></A>e.g. at sea or in disease. In what circumstances, then? Surely in the noblest. 
<A NAME="436"></A>Now such deaths are those in battle; for these take place in the greatest 
<A NAME="437"></A>and noblest danger. And these are correspondingly honoured in city-states 
<A NAME="438"></A>and at the courts of monarchs. Properly, then, he will be called brave 
<A NAME="439"></A>who is fearless in face of a noble death, and of all emergencies that involve 
<A NAME="440"></A>death; and the emergencies of war are in the highest degree of this kind. 
<A NAME="441"></A>Yet at sea also, and in disease, the brave man is fearless, but not in 
<A NAME="442"></A>the same way as the seaman; for he has given up hope of safety, and is 
<A NAME="443"></A>disliking the thought of death in this shape, while they are hopeful because 
<A NAME="444"></A>of their experience. At the same time, we show courage in situations where 
<A NAME="445"></A>there is the opportunity of showing prowess or where death is noble; but 
<A NAME="446"></A>in these forms of death neither of these conditions is 
<A NAME="447"></A>fulfilled.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>7
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR>What is terrible is not the same for all men; but we say there 
<A NAME="450"></A>are things terrible even beyond human strength. These, then, are terrible 
<A NAME="451"></A>to every one- at least to every sensible man; but the terrible things that 
<A NAME="452"></A>are not beyond human strength differ in magnitude and degree, and so too 
<A NAME="453"></A>do the things that inspire confidence. Now the brave man is as dauntless 
<A NAME="454"></A>as man may be. Therefore, while he will fear even the things that are not 
<A NAME="455"></A>beyond human strength, he will face them as he ought and as the rule directs, 
<A NAME="456"></A>for honour's sake; for this is the end of virtue. But it is possible to 
<A NAME="457"></A>fear these more, or less, and again to fear things that are not terrible 
<A NAME="458"></A>as if they were. Of the faults that are committed one consists in fearing 
<A NAME="459"></A>what one should not, another in fearing as we should not, another in fearing 
<A NAME="460"></A>when we should not, and so on; and so too with respect to the things that 
<A NAME="461"></A>inspire confidence. The man, then, who faces and who fears the right things 
<A NAME="462"></A>and from the right motive, in the right way and from the right time, and 
<A NAME="463"></A>who feels confidence under the corresponding conditions, is brave; for 
<A NAME="464"></A>the brave man feels and acts according to the merits of the case and in 
<A NAME="465"></A>whatever way the rule directs. Now the end of every activity is conformity 
<A NAME="466"></A>to the corresponding state of character. This is true, therefore, of the 
<A NAME="467"></A>brave man as well as of others. But courage is noble. Therefore the end 
<A NAME="468"></A>also is noble; for each thing is defined by its end. Therefore it is for 
<A NAME="469"></A>a noble end that the brave man endures and acts as courage 
<A NAME="470"></A>directs.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>Of those who go to excess he who exceeds in fearlessness has no 
<A NAME="472"></A>name (we have said previously that many states of character have no names), 
<A NAME="473"></A>but he would be a sort of madman or insensible person if he feared nothing, 
<A NAME="474"></A>neither earthquakes nor the waves, as they say the Celts do not; while 
<A NAME="475"></A>the man who exceeds in confidence about what really is terrible is rash. 
<A NAME="476"></A>The rash man, however, is also thought to be boastful and only a pretender 
<A NAME="477"></A>to courage; at all events, as the brave man is with regard to what is terrible, 
<A NAME="478"></A>so the rash man wishes to appear; and so he imitates him in situations 
<A NAME="479"></A>where he can. Hence also most of them are a mixture of rashness and cowardice; 
<A NAME="480"></A>for, while in these situations they display confidence, they do not hold 
<A NAME="481"></A>their ground against what is really terrible. The man who exceeds in fear 
<A NAME="482"></A>is a coward; for he fears both what he ought not and as he ought not, and 
<A NAME="483"></A>all the similar characterizations attach to him. He is lacking also in 
<A NAME="484"></A>confidence; but he is more conspicuous for his excess of fear in painful 
<A NAME="485"></A>situations. The coward, then, is a despairing sort of person; for he fears 
<A NAME="486"></A>everything. The brave man, on the other hand, has the opposite disposition; 
<A NAME="487"></A>for confidence is the mark of a hopeful disposition. The coward, the rash 
<A NAME="488"></A>man, and the brave man, then, are concerned with the same objects but are 
<A NAME="489"></A>differently disposed towards them; for the first two exceed and fall short, 
<A NAME="490"></A>while the third holds the middle, which is the right, position; and rash 
<A NAME="491"></A>men are precipitate, and wish for dangers beforehand but draw back when 
<A NAME="492"></A>they are in them, while brave men are keen in the moment of action, but 
<A NAME="493"></A>quiet beforehand.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR>As we have said, then, courage is a mean with respect to things 
<A NAME="495"></A>that inspire confidence or fear, in the circumstances that have been stated; 
<A NAME="496"></A>and it chooses or endures things because it is noble to do so, or because 
<A NAME="497"></A>it is base not to do so. But to die to escape from poverty or love or anything 
<A NAME="498"></A>painful is not the mark of a brave man, but rather of a coward; for it 
<A NAME="499"></A>is softness to fly from what is troublesome, and such a man endures death 
<A NAME="500"></A>not because it is noble but to fly from evil.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>8
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>Courage, then, is something of this sort, but the name is also 
<A NAME="503"></A>applied to five other kinds.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>First comes the courage of the citizen-soldier; for this is most 
<A NAME="505"></A>like true courage. Citizen-soldiers seem to face dangers because of the 
<A NAME="506"></A>penalties imposed by the laws and the reproaches they would otherwise incur, 
<A NAME="507"></A>and because of the honours they win by such action; and therefore those 
<A NAME="508"></A>peoples seem to be bravest among whom cowards are held in dishonour and 
<A NAME="509"></A>brave men in honour. This is the kind of courage that Homer depicts, e.g. 
<A NAME="510"></A>in Diomede and in Hector:
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>First will Polydamas be to heap reproach on me then; 
<A NAME="512"></A>and
<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR>For Hector one day 'mid the Trojans shall utter his 
<A NAME="514"></A>vaulting
<A NAME="515"></A><BR>harangue:
<A NAME="516"></A><BR>Afraid was Tydeides, and fled from my face.
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>This kind of courage is most like to that which we described earlier, 
<A NAME="518"></A>because it is due to virtue; for it is due to shame and to desire of a 
<A NAME="519"></A>noble object (i.e. honour) and avoidance of disgrace, which is ignoble. 
<A NAME="520"></A>One might rank in the same class even those who are compelled by their 
<A NAME="521"></A>rulers; but they are inferior, inasmuch as they do what they do not from 
<A NAME="522"></A>shame but from fear, and to avoid not what is disgraceful but what is painful; 
<A NAME="523"></A>for their masters compel them, as Hector does:
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>But if I shall spy any dastard that cowers far from the 
<A NAME="525"></A>fight,
<A NAME="526"></A><BR>Vainly will such an one hope to escape from the 
<A NAME="527"></A>dogs.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>And those who give them their posts, and beat them if they retreat, 
<A NAME="529"></A>do the same, and so do those who draw them up with trenches or something 
<A NAME="530"></A>of the sort behind them; all of these apply compulsion. But one ought to 
<A NAME="531"></A>be brave not under compulsion but because it is noble to be 
<A NAME="532"></A>so.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>(2) Experience with regard to particular facts is also thought 
<A NAME="534"></A>to be courage; this is indeed the reason why Socrates thought courage was 
<A NAME="535"></A>knowledge. Other people exhibit this quality in other dangers, and professional 
<A NAME="536"></A>soldiers exhibit it in the dangers of war; for there seem to be many empty 
<A NAME="537"></A>alarms in war, of which these have had the most comprehensive experience; 
<A NAME="538"></A>therefore they seem brave, because the others do not know the nature of 
<A NAME="539"></A>the facts. Again, their experience makes them most capable in attack and 
<A NAME="540"></A>in defence, since they can use their arms and have the kind that are likely 
<A NAME="541"></A>to be best both for attack and for defence; therefore they fight like armed 
<A NAME="542"></A>men against unarmed or like trained athletes against amateurs; for in such 
<A NAME="543"></A>contests too it is not the bravest men that fight best, but those who are 
<A NAME="544"></A>strongest and have their bodies in the best condition. Professional soldiers 
<A NAME="545"></A>turn cowards, however, when the danger puts too great a strain on them 
<A NAME="546"></A>and they are inferior in numbers and equipment; for they are the first 
<A NAME="547"></A>to fly, while citizen-forces die at their posts, as in fact happened at 
<A NAME="548"></A>the temple of Hermes. For to the latter flight is disgraceful and death 
<A NAME="549"></A>is preferable to safety on those terms; while the former from the very 
<A NAME="550"></A>beginning faced the danger on the assumption that they were stronger, and 
<A NAME="551"></A>when they know the facts they fly, fearing death more than disgrace; but 
<A NAME="552"></A>the brave man is not that sort of person.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>(3) Passion also is sometimes reckoned as courage; those who act 
<A NAME="554"></A>from passion, like wild beasts rushing at those who have wounded them, 
<A NAME="555"></A>are thought to be brave, because brave men also are passionate; for passion 
<A NAME="556"></A>above all things is eager to rush on danger, and hence Homer's 'put strength 
<A NAME="557"></A>into his passion' and 'aroused their spirit and passion and 'hard he breathed 
<A NAME="558"></A>panting' and 'his blood boiled'. For all such expressions seem to indicate 
<A NAME="559"></A>the stirring and onset of passion. Now brave men act for honour's sake, 
<A NAME="560"></A>but passion aids them; while wild beasts act under the influence of pain; 
<A NAME="561"></A>for they attack because they have been wounded or because they are afraid, 
<A NAME="562"></A>since if they are in a forest they do not come near one. Thus they are 
<A NAME="563"></A>not brave because, driven by pain and passion, they rush on danger without 
<A NAME="564"></A>foreseeing any of the perils, since at that rate even asses would be brave 
<A NAME="565"></A>when they are hungry; for blows will not drive them from their food; and 
<A NAME="566"></A>lust also makes adulterers do many daring things. (Those creatures are 
<A NAME="567"></A>not brave, then, which are driven on to danger by pain or passion.) The 
<A NAME="568"></A>'courage' that is due to passion seems to be the most natural, and to be 
<A NAME="569"></A>courage if choice and motive be added.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR>Men, then, as well as beasts, suffer pain when they are angry, 
<A NAME="571"></A>and are pleased when they exact their revenge; those who fight for these 
<A NAME="572"></A>reasons, however, are pugnacious but not brave; for they do not act for 
<A NAME="573"></A>honour's sake nor as the rule directs, but from strength of feeling; they 
<A NAME="574"></A>have, however, something akin to courage.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR>(4) Nor are sanguine people brave; for they are confident in danger 
<A NAME="576"></A>only because they have conquered often and against many foes. Yet they 
<A NAME="577"></A>closely resemble brave men, because both are confident; but brave men are 
<A NAME="578"></A>confident for the reasons stated earlier, while these are so because they 
<A NAME="579"></A>think they are the strongest and can suffer nothing. (Drunken men also 
<A NAME="580"></A>behave in this way; they become sanguine). When their adventures do not 
<A NAME="581"></A>succeed, however, they run away; but it was the mark of a brave man to 
<A NAME="582"></A>face things that are, and seem, terrible for a man, because it is noble 
<A NAME="583"></A>to do so and disgraceful not to do so. Hence also it is thought the mark 
<A NAME="584"></A>of a braver man to be fearless and undisturbed in sudden alarms than to 
<A NAME="585"></A>be so in those that are foreseen; for it must have proceeded more from 
<A NAME="586"></A>a state of character, because less from preparation; acts that are foreseen 
<A NAME="587"></A>may be chosen by calculation and rule, but sudden actions must be in accordance 
<A NAME="588"></A>with one's state of character.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>(5) People who are ignorant of the danger also appear brave, and 
<A NAME="590"></A>they are not far removed from those of a sanguine temper, but are inferior 
<A NAME="591"></A>inasmuch as they have no self-reliance while these have. Hence also the 
<A NAME="592"></A>sanguine hold their ground for a time; but those who have been deceived 
<A NAME="593"></A>about the facts fly if they know or suspect that these are different from 
<A NAME="594"></A>what they supposed, as happened to the Argives when they fell in with the 
<A NAME="595"></A>Spartans and took them for Sicyonians.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>We have, then, described the character both of brave men and of 
<A NAME="597"></A>those who are thought to be brave.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>9
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>Though courage is concerned with feelings of confidence and of 
<A NAME="600"></A>fear, it is not concerned with both alike, but more with the things that 
<A NAME="601"></A>inspire fear; for he who is undisturbed in face of these and bears himself 
<A NAME="602"></A>as he should towards these is more truly brave than the man who does so 
<A NAME="603"></A>towards the things that inspire confidence. It is for facing what is painful, 
<A NAME="604"></A>then, as has been said, that men are called brave. Hence also courage involves 
<A NAME="605"></A>pain, and is justly praised; for it is harder to face what is painful than 
<A NAME="606"></A>to abstain from what is pleasant.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>Yet the end which courage sets before it would seem to be pleasant, 
<A NAME="608"></A>but to be concealed by the attending circumstances, as happens also in 
<A NAME="609"></A>athletic contests; for the end at which boxers aim is pleasant- the crown 
<A NAME="610"></A>and the honours- but the blows they take are distressing to flesh and blood, 
<A NAME="611"></A>and painful, and so is their whole exertion; and because the blows and 
<A NAME="612"></A>the exertions are many the end, which is but small, appears to have nothing 
<A NAME="613"></A>pleasant in it. And so, if the case of courage is similar, death and wounds 
<A NAME="614"></A>will be painful to the brave man and against his will, but he will face 
<A NAME="615"></A>them because it is noble to do so or because it is base not to do so. And 
<A NAME="616"></A>the more he is possessed of virtue in its entirety and the happier he is, 
<A NAME="617"></A>the more he will be pained at the thought of death; for life is best worth 
<A NAME="618"></A>living for such a man, and he is knowingly losing the greatest goods, and 
<A NAME="619"></A>this is painful. But he is none the less brave, and perhaps all the more 
<A NAME="620"></A>so, because he chooses noble deeds of war at that cost. It is not the case, 
<A NAME="621"></A>then, with all the virtues that the exercise of them is pleasant, except 
<A NAME="622"></A>in so far as it reaches its end. But it is quite possible that the best 
<A NAME="623"></A>soldiers may be not men of this sort but those who are less brave but have 
<A NAME="624"></A>no other good; for these are ready to face danger, and they sell their 
<A NAME="625"></A>life for trifling gains.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>So much, then, for courage; it is not difficult to grasp its nature 
<A NAME="627"></A>in outline, at any rate, from what has been said.
<A NAME="628"></A><BR><BR>10
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>After courage let us speak of temperance; for these seem to be 
<A NAME="630"></A>the virtues of the irrational parts. We have said that temperance is a 
<A NAME="631"></A>mean with regard to pleasures (for it is less, and not in the same way, 
<A NAME="632"></A>concerned with pains); self-indulgence also is manifested in the same sphere. 
<A NAME="633"></A>Now, therefore, let us determine with what sort of pleasures they are concerned. 
<A NAME="634"></A>We may assume the distinction between bodily pleasures and those of the 
<A NAME="635"></A>soul, such as love of honour and love of learning; for the lover of each 
<A NAME="636"></A>of these delights in that of which he is a lover, the body being in no 
<A NAME="637"></A>way affected, but rather the mind; but men who are concerned with such 
<A NAME="638"></A>pleasures are called neither temperate nor self-indulgent. Nor, again, 
<A NAME="639"></A>are those who are concerned with the other pleasures that are not bodily; 
<A NAME="640"></A>for those who are fond of hearing and telling stories and who spend their 
<A NAME="641"></A>days on anything that turns up are called gossips, but not self-indulgent, 
<A NAME="642"></A>nor are those who are pained at the loss of money or of 
<A NAME="643"></A>friends.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>Temperance must be concerned with bodily pleasures, but not all 
<A NAME="645"></A>even of these; for those who delight in objects of vision, such as colours 
<A NAME="646"></A>and shapes and painting, are called neither temperate nor self-indulgent; 
<A NAME="647"></A>yet it would seem possible to delight even in these either as one should 
<A NAME="648"></A>or to excess or to a deficient degree.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>And so too is it with objects of hearing; no one calls those who 
<A NAME="650"></A>delight extravagantly in music or acting self-indulgent, nor those who 
<A NAME="651"></A>do so as they ought temperate.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>Nor do we apply these names to those who delight in odour, unless 
<A NAME="653"></A>it be incidentally; we do not call those self-indulgent who delight in 
<A NAME="654"></A>the odour of apples or roses or incense, but rather those who delight in 
<A NAME="655"></A>the odour of unguents or of dainty dishes; for self-indulgent people delight 
<A NAME="656"></A>in these because these remind them of the objects of their appetite. And 
<A NAME="657"></A>one may see even other people, when they are hungry, delighting in the 
<A NAME="658"></A>smell of food; but to delight in this kind of thing is the mark of the 
<A NAME="659"></A>self-indulgent man; for these are objects of appetite to 
<A NAME="660"></A>him.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR>Nor is there in animals other than man any pleasure connected with 
<A NAME="662"></A>these senses, except incidentally. For dogs do not delight in the scent 
<A NAME="663"></A>of hares, but in the eating of them, but the scent told them the hares 
<A NAME="664"></A>were there; nor does the lion delight in the lowing of the ox, but in eating 
<A NAME="665"></A>it; but he perceived by the lowing that it was near, and therefore appears 
<A NAME="666"></A>to delight in the lowing; and similarly he does not delight because he 
<A NAME="667"></A>sees 'a stag or a wild goat', but because he is going to make a meal of 
<A NAME="668"></A>it. Temperance and self-indulgence, however, are concerned with the kind 
<A NAME="669"></A>of pleasures that the other animals share in, which therefore appear slavish 
<A NAME="670"></A>and brutish; these are touch and taste. But even of taste they appear to 
<A NAME="671"></A>make little or no use; for the business of taste is the discriminating 
<A NAME="672"></A>of flavours, which is done by winetasters and people who season dishes; 
<A NAME="673"></A>but they hardly take pleasure in making these discriminations, or at least 
<A NAME="674"></A>self-indulgent people do not, but in the actual enjoyment, which in all 
<A NAME="675"></A>cases comes through touch, both in the case of food and in that of drink 
<A NAME="676"></A>and in that of sexual intercourse. This is why a certain gourmand prayed 
<A NAME="677"></A>that his throat might become longer than a crane's, implying that it was 
<A NAME="678"></A>the contact that he took pleasure in. Thus the sense with which self-indulgence 
<A NAME="679"></A>is connected is the most widely shared of the senses; and self-indulgence 
<A NAME="680"></A>would seem to be justly a matter of reproach, because it attaches to us 
<A NAME="681"></A>not as men but as animals. To delight in such things, then, and to love 
<A NAME="682"></A>them above all others, is brutish. For even of the pleasures of touch the 
<A NAME="683"></A>most liberal have been eliminated, e.g. those produced in the gymnasium 
<A NAME="684"></A>by rubbing and by the consequent heat; for the contact characteristic of 
<A NAME="685"></A>the self-indulgent man does not affect the whole body but only certain 
<A NAME="686"></A>parts.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR>11
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>Of the appetites some seem to be common, others to be peculiar 
<A NAME="689"></A>to individuals and acquired; e.g. the appetite for food is natural, since 
<A NAME="690"></A>every one who is without it craves for food or drink, and sometimes for 
<A NAME="691"></A>both, and for love also (as Homer says) if he is young and lusty; but not 
<A NAME="692"></A>every one craves for this or that kind of nourishment or love, nor for 
<A NAME="693"></A>the same things. Hence such craving appears to be our very own. Yet it 
<A NAME="694"></A>has of course something natural about it; for different things are pleasant 
<A NAME="695"></A>to different kinds of people, and some things are more pleasant to every 
<A NAME="696"></A>one than chance objects. Now in the natural appetites few go wrong, and 
<A NAME="697"></A>only in one direction, that of excess; for to eat or drink whatever offers 
<A NAME="698"></A>itself till one is surfeited is to exceed the natural amount, since natural 
<A NAME="699"></A>appetite is the replenishment of one's deficiency. Hence these people are 
<A NAME="700"></A>called belly-gods, this implying that they fill their belly beyond what 
<A NAME="701"></A>is right. It is people of entirely slavish character that become like this. 
<A NAME="702"></A>But with regard to the pleasures peculiar to individuals many people go 
<A NAME="703"></A>wrong and in many ways. For while the people who are 'fond of so and so' 
<A NAME="704"></A>are so called because they delight either in the wrong things, or more 
<A NAME="705"></A>than most people do, or in the wrong way, the self-indulgent exceed in 
<A NAME="706"></A>all three ways; they both delight in some things that they ought not to 
<A NAME="707"></A>delight in (since they are hateful), and if one ought to delight in some 
<A NAME="708"></A>of the things they delight in, they do so more than one ought and than 
<A NAME="709"></A>most men do.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR>Plainly, then, excess with regard to pleasures is self-indulgence 
<A NAME="711"></A>and is culpable; with regard to pains one is not, as in the case of courage, 
<A NAME="712"></A>called temperate for facing them or self-indulgent for not doing so, but 
<A NAME="713"></A>the selfindulgent man is so called because he is pained more than he ought 
<A NAME="714"></A>at not getting pleasant things (even his pain being caused by pleasure), 
<A NAME="715"></A>and the temperate man is so called because he is not pained at the absence 
<A NAME="716"></A>of what is pleasant and at his abstinence from it.
<A NAME="717"></A><BR><BR>The self-indulgent man, then, craves for all pleasant things or 
<A NAME="718"></A>those that are most pleasant, and is led by his appetite to choose these 
<A NAME="719"></A>at the cost of everything else; hence he is pained both when he fails to 
<A NAME="720"></A>get them and when he is merely craving for them (for appetite involves 
<A NAME="721"></A>pain); but it seems absurd to be pained for the sake of pleasure. People 
<A NAME="722"></A>who fall short with regard to pleasures and delight in them less than they 
<A NAME="723"></A>should are hardly found; for such insensibility is not human. Even the 
<A NAME="724"></A>other animals distinguish different kinds of food and enjoy some and not 
<A NAME="725"></A>others; and if there is any one who finds nothing pleasant and nothing 
<A NAME="726"></A>more attractive than anything else, he must be something quite different 
<A NAME="727"></A>from a man; this sort of person has not received a name because he hardly 
<A NAME="728"></A>occurs. The temperate man occupies a middle position with regard to these 
<A NAME="729"></A>objects. For he neither enjoys the things that the self-indulgent man enjoys 
<A NAME="730"></A>most-but rather dislikes them-nor in general the things that he should 
<A NAME="731"></A>not, nor anything of this sort to excess, nor does he feel pain or craving 
<A NAME="732"></A>when they are absent, or does so only to a moderate degree, and not more 
<A NAME="733"></A>than he should, nor when he should not, and so on; but the things that, 
<A NAME="734"></A>being pleasant, make for health or for good condition, he will desire moderately 
<A NAME="735"></A>and as he should, and also other pleasant things if they are not hindrances 
<A NAME="736"></A>to these ends, or contrary to what is noble, or beyond his means. For he 
<A NAME="737"></A>who neglects these conditions loves such pleasures more than they are worth, 
<A NAME="738"></A>but the temperate man is not that sort of person, but the sort of person 
<A NAME="739"></A>that the right rule prescribes.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR>12
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR>Self-indulgence is more like a voluntary state than cowardice. 
<A NAME="742"></A>For the former is actuated by pleasure, the latter by pain, of which the 
<A NAME="743"></A>one is to be chosen and the other to be avoided; and pain upsets and destroys 
<A NAME="744"></A>the nature of the person who feels it, while pleasure does nothing of the 
<A NAME="745"></A>sort. Therefore self-indulgence is more voluntary. Hence also it is more 
<A NAME="746"></A>a matter of reproach; for it is easier to become accustomed to its objects, 
<A NAME="747"></A>since there are many things of this sort in life, and the process of habituation 
<A NAME="748"></A>to them is free from danger, while with terrible objects the reverse is 
<A NAME="749"></A>the case. But cowardice would seem to be voluntary in a different degree 
<A NAME="750"></A>from its particular manifestations; for it is itself painless, but in these 
<A NAME="751"></A>we are upset by pain, so that we even throw down our arms and disgrace 
<A NAME="752"></A>ourselves in other ways; hence our acts are even thought to be done under 
<A NAME="753"></A>compulsion. For the self-indulgent man, on the other hand, the particular 
<A NAME="754"></A>acts are voluntary (for he does them with craving and desire), but the 
<A NAME="755"></A>whole state is less so; for no one craves to be self-indulgent.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>The name self-indulgence is applied also to childish faults; for 
<A NAME="757"></A>they bear a certain resemblance to what we have been considering. Which 
<A NAME="758"></A>is called after which, makes no difference to our present purpose; plainly, 
<A NAME="759"></A>however, the later is called after the earlier. The transference of the 
<A NAME="760"></A>name seems not a bad one; for that which desires what is base and which 
<A NAME="761"></A>develops quickly ought to be kept in a chastened condition, and these characteristics 
<A NAME="762"></A>belong above all to appetite and to the child, since children in fact live 
<A NAME="763"></A>at the beck and call of appetite, and it is in them that the desire for 
<A NAME="764"></A>what is pleasant is strongest. If, then, it is not going to be obedient 
<A NAME="765"></A>and subject to the ruling principle, it will go to great lengths; for in 
<A NAME="766"></A>an irrational being the desire for pleasure is insatiable even if it tries 
<A NAME="767"></A>every source of gratification, and the exercise of appetite increases its 
<A NAME="768"></A>innate force, and if appetites are strong and violent they even expel the 
<A NAME="769"></A>power of calculation. Hence they should be moderate and few, and should 
<A NAME="770"></A>in no way oppose the rational principle-and this is what we call an obedient 
<A NAME="771"></A>and chastened state-and as the child should live according to the direction 
<A NAME="772"></A>of his tutor, so the appetitive element should live according to rational 
<A NAME="773"></A>principle. Hence the appetitive element in a temperate man should harmonize 
<A NAME="774"></A>with the rational principle; for the noble is the mark at which both aim, 
<A NAME="775"></A>and the temperate man craves for the things be ought, as he ought, as when 
<A NAME="776"></A>he ought; and when he ought; and this is what rational principle 
<A NAME="777"></A>directs.
<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR>Here we conclude our account of temperance.
