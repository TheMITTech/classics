<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Next there fall to be discussed the problems of arrangement and method 
<A NAME="12"></A>in pitting questions. Any one who intends to frame questions must, first 
<A NAME="13"></A>of all, select the ground from which he should make his attack; secondly, 
<A NAME="14"></A>he must frame them and arrange them one by one to himself; thirdly and 
<A NAME="15"></A>lastly, he must proceed actually to put them to the other party. Now so 
<A NAME="16"></A>far as the selection of his ground is concerned the problem is one alike 
<A NAME="17"></A>for the philosopher and the dialectician; but how to go on to arrange his 
<A NAME="18"></A>points and frame his questions concerns the dialectician only: for in every 
<A NAME="19"></A>problem of that kind a reference to another party is involved. Not so with 
<A NAME="20"></A>the philosopher, and the man who is investigating by himself: the premisses 
<A NAME="21"></A>of his reasoning, although true and familiar, may be refused by the answerer 
<A NAME="22"></A>because they lie too near the original statement and so he foresees what 
<A NAME="23"></A>will follow if he grants them: but for this the philosopher does not care. 
<A NAME="24"></A>Nay, he may possibly be even anxious to secure axioms as familiar and as 
<A NAME="25"></A>near to the question in hand as possible: for these are the bases on which 
<A NAME="26"></A>scientific reasonings are built up.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>The sources from which one's commonplace arguments should be drawn 
<A NAME="28"></A>have already been described:' we have now to discuss the arrangement and 
<A NAME="29"></A>formation of questions and first to distinguish the premisses, other than 
<A NAME="30"></A>the necessary premisses, which have to be adopted. By necessary premisses 
<A NAME="31"></A>are meant those through which the actual reasoning is constructed. Those 
<A NAME="32"></A>which are secured other than these are of four kinds; they serve either 
<A NAME="33"></A>inductively to secure the universal premiss being granted, or to lend weight 
<A NAME="34"></A>to the argument, or to conceal the conclusion, or to render the argument 
<A NAME="35"></A>more clear. Beside these there is no other premiss which need be secured: 
<A NAME="36"></A>these are the ones whereby you should try to multiply and formulate your 
<A NAME="37"></A>questions. Those which are used to conceal the conclusion serve a controversial 
<A NAME="38"></A>purpose only; but inasmuch as an undertaking of this sort is always conducted 
<A NAME="39"></A>against another person, we are obliged to employ them as 
<A NAME="40"></A>well.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>The necessary premisses through which the reasoning is effected, 
<A NAME="42"></A>ought not to be propounded directly in so many words. Rather one should 
<A NAME="43"></A>soar as far aloof from them as possible. Thus if one desires to secure 
<A NAME="44"></A>an admission that the knowledge of contraries is one, one should ask him 
<A NAME="45"></A>to admit it not of contraries, but of opposites: for, if he grants this, 
<A NAME="46"></A>one will then argue that the knowledge of contraries is also the same, 
<A NAME="47"></A>seeing that contraries are opposites; if he does not, one should secure 
<A NAME="48"></A>the admission by induction, by formulating a proposition to that effect 
<A NAME="49"></A>in the case of some particular pair of contraries. For one must secure 
<A NAME="50"></A>the necessary premisses either by reasoning or by induction, or else partly 
<A NAME="51"></A>by one and partly by the other, although any propositions which are too 
<A NAME="52"></A>obvious to be denied may be formulated in so many words. This is because 
<A NAME="53"></A>the coming conclusion is less easily discerned at the greater distance 
<A NAME="54"></A>and in the process of induction, while at the same time, even if one cannot 
<A NAME="55"></A>reach the required premisses in this way, it is still open to one to formulate 
<A NAME="56"></A>them in so many words. The premisses, other than these, that were mentioned 
<A NAME="57"></A>above, must be secured with a view to the latter. The way to employ them 
<A NAME="58"></A>respectively is as follows: Induction should proceed from individual cases 
<A NAME="59"></A>to the universal and from the known to the unknown; and the objects of 
<A NAME="60"></A>perception are better known, to most people if not invariably. Concealment 
<A NAME="61"></A>of one's plan is obtained by securing through prosyllogisms the premisses 
<A NAME="62"></A>through which the proof of the original proposition is going to be constructed-and 
<A NAME="63"></A>as many of them as possible. This is likely to be effected by making syllogisms 
<A NAME="64"></A>to prove not only the necessary premisses but also some of those which 
<A NAME="65"></A>are required to establish them. Moreover, do not state the conclusions 
<A NAME="66"></A>of these premisses but draw them later one after another; for this is likely 
<A NAME="67"></A>to keep the answerer at the greatest possible distance from the original 
<A NAME="68"></A>proposition. Speaking generally, a man who desires to get information by 
<A NAME="69"></A>a concealed method should so put his questions that when he has put his 
<A NAME="70"></A>whole argument and has stated the conclusion, people still ask 'Well, but 
<A NAME="71"></A>why is that?' This result will be secured best of all by the method above 
<A NAME="72"></A>described: for if one states only the final conclusion, it is unclear how 
<A NAME="73"></A>it comes about; for the answerer does not foresee on what grounds it is 
<A NAME="74"></A>based, because the previous syllogisms have not been made articulate to 
<A NAME="75"></A>him: while the final syllogism, showing the conclusion, is likely to be 
<A NAME="76"></A>kept least articulate if we lay down not the secured propositions on which 
<A NAME="77"></A>it is based, but only the grounds on which we reason to 
<A NAME="78"></A>them.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>It is a useful rule, too, not to secure the admissions claimed 
<A NAME="80"></A>as the bases of the syllogisms in their proper order, but alternately those 
<A NAME="81"></A>that conduce to one conclusion and those that conduce to another; for, 
<A NAME="82"></A>if those which go together are set side by side, the conclusion that will 
<A NAME="83"></A>result from them is more obvious in advance.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>One should also, wherever possible, secure the universal premiss 
<A NAME="85"></A>by a definition relating not to the precise terms themselves but to their 
<A NAME="86"></A>co-ordinates; for people deceive themselves, whenever the definition is 
<A NAME="87"></A>taken in regard to a co-ordinate, into thinking that they are not making 
<A NAME="88"></A>the admission universally. An instance would be, supposing one had to secure 
<A NAME="89"></A>the admission that the angry man desires vengeance on account of an apparent 
<A NAME="90"></A>slight, and were to secure this, that 'anger' is a desire for vengeance 
<A NAME="91"></A>on account of an apparent slight: for, clearly, if this were secured, we 
<A NAME="92"></A>should have universally what we intend. If, on the other hand, people formulate 
<A NAME="93"></A>propositions relating to the actual terms themselves, they often find that 
<A NAME="94"></A>the answerer refuses to grant them because on the actual term itself he 
<A NAME="95"></A>is readier with his objection, e.g. that the 'angry man' does not desire 
<A NAME="96"></A>vengeance, because we become angry with our parents, but we do not desire 
<A NAME="97"></A>vengeance on them. Very likely the objection is not valid; for upon some 
<A NAME="98"></A>people it is vengeance enough to cause them pain and make them sorry; but 
<A NAME="99"></A>still it gives a certain plausibility and air of reasonableness to the 
<A NAME="100"></A>denial of the proposition. In the case, however, of the definition of 'anger' 
<A NAME="101"></A>it is not so easy to find an objection.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, formulate your proposition as though you did so not for 
<A NAME="103"></A>its own sake, but in order to get at something else: for people are shy 
<A NAME="104"></A>of granting what an opponent's case really requires. Speaking generally, 
<A NAME="105"></A>a questioner should leave it as far as possible doubtful whether he wishes 
<A NAME="106"></A>to secure an admission of his proposition or of its opposite: for if it 
<A NAME="107"></A>be uncertain what their opponent's argument requires, people are more ready 
<A NAME="108"></A>to say what they themselves think.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, try to secure admissions by means of likeness: for such 
<A NAME="110"></A>admissions are plausible, and the universal involved is less patent; e.g. 
<A NAME="111"></A>make the other person admit that as knowledge and ignorance of contraries 
<A NAME="112"></A>is the same, so too perception of contraries is the same; or vice versa, 
<A NAME="113"></A>that since the perception is the same, so is the knowledge also. This argument 
<A NAME="114"></A>resembles induction, but is not the same thing; for in induction it is 
<A NAME="115"></A>the universal whose admission is secured from the particulars, whereas 
<A NAME="116"></A>in arguments from likeness, what is secured is not the universal under 
<A NAME="117"></A>which all the like cases fall.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>It is a good rule also, occasionally to bring an objection against 
<A NAME="119"></A>oneself: for answerers are put off their guard against those who appear 
<A NAME="120"></A>to be arguing impartially. It is useful too, to add that 'So and so is 
<A NAME="121"></A>generally held or commonly said'; for people are shy of upsetting the received 
<A NAME="122"></A>opinion unless they have some positive objection to urge: and at the same 
<A NAME="123"></A>time they are cautious about upsetting such things because they themselves 
<A NAME="124"></A>too find them useful. Moreover, do not be insistent, even though you really 
<A NAME="125"></A>require the point: for insistence always arouses the more opposition. Further, 
<A NAME="126"></A>formulate your premiss as though it were a mere illustration: for people 
<A NAME="127"></A>admit the more readily a proposition made to serve some other purpose, 
<A NAME="128"></A>and not required on its own account. Moreover, do not formulate the very 
<A NAME="129"></A>proposition you need to secure, but rather something from which that necessarily 
<A NAME="130"></A>follows: for people are more willing to admit the latter, because it is 
<A NAME="131"></A>not so clear from this what the result will be, and if the one has been 
<A NAME="132"></A>secured, the other has been secured also. Again, one should put last the 
<A NAME="133"></A>point which one most wishes to have conceded; for people are specially 
<A NAME="134"></A>inclined to deny the first questions put to them, because most people in 
<A NAME="135"></A>asking questions put first the points which they are most eager to secure. 
<A NAME="136"></A>On the other hand, in dealing with some people propositions of this sort 
<A NAME="137"></A>should be put forward first: for ill-tempered men admit most readily what 
<A NAME="138"></A>comes first, unless the conclusion that will result actually stares them 
<A NAME="139"></A>in the face, while at the close of an argument they show their ill-temper. 
<A NAME="140"></A>Likewise also with those who consider themselves smart at answering: for 
<A NAME="141"></A>when they have admitted most of what you want they finally talk clap-trap 
<A NAME="142"></A>to the effect that the conclusion does not follow from their admissions: 
<A NAME="143"></A>yet they say 'Yes' readily, confident in their own character, and imagining 
<A NAME="144"></A>that they cannot suffer any reverse. Moreover, it is well to expand the 
<A NAME="145"></A>argument and insert things that it does not require at all, as do those 
<A NAME="146"></A>who draw false geometrical figures: for in the multitude of details the 
<A NAME="147"></A>whereabouts of the fallacy is obscured. For this reason also a questioner 
<A NAME="148"></A>sometimes evades observation as he adds in a corner what, if he formulated 
<A NAME="149"></A>it by itself, would not be granted.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>For concealment, then, the rules which should be followed are the 
<A NAME="151"></A>above. Ornament is attained by induction and distinction of things closely 
<A NAME="152"></A>akin. What sort of process induction is obvious: as for distinction, an 
<A NAME="153"></A>instance of the kind of thing meant is the distinction of one form of knowledge 
<A NAME="154"></A>as better than another by being either more accurate, or concerned with 
<A NAME="155"></A>better objects; or the distinction of sciences into speculative, practical, 
<A NAME="156"></A>and productive. For everything of this kind lends additional ornament to 
<A NAME="157"></A>the argument, though there is no necessity to say them, so far as the conclusion 
<A NAME="158"></A>goes.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>For clearness, examples and comparisons should be adduced, and 
<A NAME="160"></A>let the illustrations be relevant and drawn from things that we know, as 
<A NAME="161"></A>in Homer and not as in Choerilus; for then the proposition is likely to 
<A NAME="162"></A>become clearer.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="163"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>In dialectics, syllogism should be employed in reasoning against 
<A NAME="165"></A>dialecticians rather than against the crowd: induction, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="166"></A>is most useful against the crowd. This point has been treated previously 
<A NAME="167"></A>as well.' In induction, it is possible in some cases to ask the question 
<A NAME="168"></A>in its universal form, but in others this is not easy, because there is 
<A NAME="169"></A>no established general term that covers all the resemblances: in this case, 
<A NAME="170"></A>when people need to secure the universal, they use the phrase 'in all cases 
<A NAME="171"></A>of this sort'. But it is one of the very hardest things to distinguish 
<A NAME="172"></A>which of the things adduced are 'of this sort', and which are not: and 
<A NAME="173"></A>in this connexion people often throw dust in each others' eyes in their 
<A NAME="174"></A>discussion, the one party asserting the likeness of things that are not 
<A NAME="175"></A>alike, and the other disputing the likeness of things that are. One ought, 
<A NAME="176"></A>therefore, to try oneself to coin a word to cover all things of the given 
<A NAME="177"></A>sort, so as to leave no opportunity either to the answerer to dispute, 
<A NAME="178"></A>and say that the thing advanced does not answer to a like description, 
<A NAME="179"></A>or to the questioner to suggest falsely that it does answer to a like description, 
<A NAME="180"></A>for many things appear to answer to like descriptions that do not really 
<A NAME="181"></A>do so.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>If one has made an induction on the strength of several cases and 
<A NAME="183"></A>yet the answerer refuses to grant the universal proposition, then it is 
<A NAME="184"></A>fair to demand his objection. But until one has oneself stated in what 
<A NAME="185"></A>cases it is so, it is not fair to demand that he shall say in what cases 
<A NAME="186"></A>it is not so: for one should make the induction first, and then demand 
<A NAME="187"></A>the objection. One ought, moreover, to claim that the objections should 
<A NAME="188"></A>not be brought in reference to the actual subject of the proposition, unless 
<A NAME="189"></A>that subject happen to be the one and only thing of the kind, as for instance 
<A NAME="190"></A>two is the one prime number among the even numbers: for, unless he can 
<A NAME="191"></A>say that this subject is unique of its kind, the objector ought to make 
<A NAME="192"></A>his objection in regard to some other. People sometimes object to a universal 
<A NAME="193"></A>proposition, and bring their objection not in regard to the thing itself, 
<A NAME="194"></A>but in regard to some homonym of it: thus they argue that a man can very 
<A NAME="195"></A>well have a colour or a foot or a hand other than his own, for a painter 
<A NAME="196"></A>may have a colour that is not his own, and a cook may have a foot that 
<A NAME="197"></A>is not his own. To meet them, therefore, you should draw the distinction 
<A NAME="198"></A>before putting your question in such cases: for so long as the ambiguity 
<A NAME="199"></A>remains undetected, so long will the objection to the proposition be deemed 
<A NAME="200"></A>valid. If, however, he checks the series of questions by an objection in 
<A NAME="201"></A>regard not to some homonym, but to the actual thing asserted, the questioner 
<A NAME="202"></A>should withdraw the point objected to, and form the remainder into a universal 
<A NAME="203"></A>proposition, until he secures what he requires; e.g. in the case of forgetfulness 
<A NAME="204"></A>and having forgotten: for people refuse to admit that the man who has lost 
<A NAME="205"></A>his knowledge of a thing has forgotten it, because if the thing alters, 
<A NAME="206"></A>he has lost knowledge of it, but he has not forgotten it. Accordingly the 
<A NAME="207"></A>thing to do is to withdraw the part objected to, and assert the remainder, 
<A NAME="208"></A>e.g. that if a person have lost knowledge of a thing while it still remains, 
<A NAME="209"></A>he then has forgotten it. One should similarly treat those who object to 
<A NAME="210"></A>the statement that 'the greater the good, the greater the evil that is 
<A NAME="211"></A>its opposite': for they allege that health, which is a less good thing 
<A NAME="212"></A>than vigour, has a greater evil as its opposite: for disease is a greater 
<A NAME="213"></A>evil than debility. In this case too, therefore, we have to withdraw the 
<A NAME="214"></A>point objected to; for when it has been withdrawn, the man is more likely 
<A NAME="215"></A>to admit the proposition, e.g. that 'the greater good has the greater evil 
<A NAME="216"></A>as its opposite, unless the one good involves the other as well', as vigour 
<A NAME="217"></A>involves health. This should be done not only when he formulates an objection, 
<A NAME="218"></A>but also if, without so doing, he refuses to admit the point because he 
<A NAME="219"></A>foresees something of the kind: for if the point objected to be withdrawn, 
<A NAME="220"></A>he will be forced to admit the proposition because he cannot foresee in 
<A NAME="221"></A>the rest of it any case where it does not hold true: if he refuse to admit 
<A NAME="222"></A>it, then when asked for an objection he certainly will be unable to render 
<A NAME="223"></A>one. Propositions that are partly false and partly true are of this type: 
<A NAME="224"></A>for in the case of these it is possible by withdrawing a part to leave 
<A NAME="225"></A>the rest true. If, however, you formulate the proposition on the strength 
<A NAME="226"></A>of many cases and he has no objection to bring, you may claim that he shall 
<A NAME="227"></A>admit it: for a premiss is valid in dialectics which thus holds in several 
<A NAME="228"></A>instances and to which no objection is forthcoming.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>Whenever it is possible to reason to the same conclusion either 
<A NAME="230"></A>through or without a reduction per impossibile, if one is demonstrating 
<A NAME="231"></A>and not arguing dialectically it makes no difference which method of reasoning 
<A NAME="232"></A>be adopted, but in argument with another reasoning per impossibile should 
<A NAME="233"></A>be avoided. For where one has reasoned without the reduction per impossibile, 
<A NAME="234"></A>no dispute can arise; if, on the other hand, one does reason to an impossible 
<A NAME="235"></A>conclusion, unless its falsehood is too plainly manifest, people deny that 
<A NAME="236"></A>it is impossible, so that the questioners do not get what they 
<A NAME="237"></A>want.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>One should put forward all propositions that hold true of several 
<A NAME="239"></A>cases, and to which either no objection whatever appears or at least not 
<A NAME="240"></A>any on the surface: for when people cannot see any case in which it is 
<A NAME="241"></A>not so, they admit it for true.
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>The conclusion should not be put in the form of a question; if 
<A NAME="243"></A>it be, and the man shakes his head, it looks as if the reasoning had failed. 
<A NAME="244"></A>For often, even if it be not put as a question but advanced as a consequence, 
<A NAME="245"></A>people deny it, and then those who do not see that it follows upon the 
<A NAME="246"></A>previous admissions do not realize that those who deny it have been refuted: 
<A NAME="247"></A>when, then, the one man merely asks it as a question without even saying 
<A NAME="248"></A>that it so follows, and the other denies it, it looks altogether as if 
<A NAME="249"></A>the reasoning had failed.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>Not every universal question can form a dialectical proposition 
<A NAME="251"></A>as ordinarily understood, e.g. 'What is man?' or 'How many meanings has 
<A NAME="252"></A>"the good"?' For a dialectical premiss must be of a form to which it is 
<A NAME="253"></A>possible to reply 'Yes' or 'No', whereas to the aforesaid it is not possible. 
<A NAME="254"></A>For this reason questions of this kind are not dialectical unless the questioner 
<A NAME="255"></A>himself draws distinctions or divisions before expressing them, e.g. 'Good 
<A NAME="256"></A>means this, or this, does it not?' For questions of this sort are easily 
<A NAME="257"></A>answered by a Yes or a No. Hence one should endeavour to formulate propositions 
<A NAME="258"></A>of this kind in this form. It is at the same time also perhaps fair to 
<A NAME="259"></A>ask the other man how many meanings of 'the good' there are, whenever you 
<A NAME="260"></A>have yourself distinguished and formulated them, and he will not admit 
<A NAME="261"></A>them at all.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>Any one who keeps on asking one thing for a long time is a bad 
<A NAME="263"></A>inquirer. For if he does so though the person questioned keeps on answering 
<A NAME="264"></A>the questions, clearly he asks a large number of questions, or else asks 
<A NAME="265"></A>the same question a large number of times: in the one case he merely babbles, 
<A NAME="266"></A>in the other he fails to reason: for reasoning always consists of a small 
<A NAME="267"></A>number of premisses. If, on the other hand, he does it because the person 
<A NAME="268"></A>questioned does not answer the questions, he is at fault in not taking 
<A NAME="269"></A>him to task or breaking off the discussion.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="270"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>There are certain hypotheses upon which it is at once difficult 
<A NAME="272"></A>to bring, and easy to stand up to, an argument. Such (e.g.) are those things 
<A NAME="273"></A>which stand first and those which stand last in the order of nature. For 
<A NAME="274"></A>the former require definition, while the latter have to be arrived at through 
<A NAME="275"></A>many steps if one wishes to secure a continuous proof from first principles, 
<A NAME="276"></A>or else all discussion about them wears the air of mere sophistry: for 
<A NAME="277"></A>to prove anything is impossible unless one begins with the appropriate 
<A NAME="278"></A>principles, and connects inference with inference till the last are reached. 
<A NAME="279"></A>Now to define first principles is just what answerers do not care to do, 
<A NAME="280"></A>nor do they pay any attention if the questioner makes a definition: and 
<A NAME="281"></A>yet until it is clear what it is that is proposed, it is not easy to discuss 
<A NAME="282"></A>it. This sort of thing happens particularly in the case of the first principles: 
<A NAME="283"></A>for while the other propositions are shown through these, these cannot 
<A NAME="284"></A>be shown through anything else: we are obliged to understand every item 
<A NAME="285"></A>of that sort by a definition. The inferences, too, that lie too close to 
<A NAME="286"></A>the first principle are hard to treat in argument: for it is not possible 
<A NAME="287"></A>to bring many arguments in regard to them, because of the small number 
<A NAME="288"></A>of those steps, between the conclusion and the principle, whereby the succeeding 
<A NAME="289"></A>propositions have to be shown. The hardest, however, of all definitions 
<A NAME="290"></A>to treat in argument are those that employ terms about which, in the first 
<A NAME="291"></A>place, it is uncertain whether they are used in one sense or several, and, 
<A NAME="292"></A>further, whether they are used literally or metaphorically by the definer. 
<A NAME="293"></A>For because of their obscurity, it is impossible to argue upon such terms; 
<A NAME="294"></A>and because of the impossibility of saying whether this obscurity is due 
<A NAME="295"></A>to their being used metaphorically, it is impossible to refute 
<A NAME="296"></A>them.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>In general, it is safe to suppose that, whenever any problem proves 
<A NAME="298"></A>intractable, it either needs definition or else bears either several senses, 
<A NAME="299"></A>or a metaphorical sense, or it is not far removed from the first principles; 
<A NAME="300"></A>or else the reason is that we have yet to discover in the first place just 
<A NAME="301"></A>this-in which of the aforesaid directions the source of our difficulty 
<A NAME="302"></A>lies: when we have made this clear, then obviously our business must be 
<A NAME="303"></A>either to define or to distinguish, or to supply the intermediate premisses: 
<A NAME="304"></A>for it is through these that the final conclusions are 
<A NAME="305"></A>shown.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>It often happens that a difficulty is found in discussing or arguing 
<A NAME="307"></A>a given position because the definition has not been correctly rendered: 
<A NAME="308"></A>e.g. 'Has one thing one contrary or many?': here when the term 'contraries' 
<A NAME="309"></A>has been properly defined, it is easy to bring people to see whether it 
<A NAME="310"></A>is possible for the same thing to have several contraries or not: in the 
<A NAME="311"></A>same way also with other terms requiring definition. It appears also in 
<A NAME="312"></A>mathematics that the difficulty in using a figure is sometimes due to a 
<A NAME="313"></A>defect in definition; e.g. in proving that the line which cuts the plane 
<A NAME="314"></A>parallel to one side divides similarly both the line which it cuts and 
<A NAME="315"></A>the area; whereas if the definition be given, the fact asserted becomes 
<A NAME="316"></A>immediately clear: for the areas have the same fraction subtracted from 
<A NAME="317"></A>them as have the sides: and this is the definition of 'the same ratio'. 
<A NAME="318"></A>The most primary of the elementary principles are without exception very 
<A NAME="319"></A>easy to show, if the definitions involved, e.g. the nature of a line or 
<A NAME="320"></A>of a circle, be laid down; only the arguments that can be brought in regard 
<A NAME="321"></A>to each of them are not many, because there are not many intermediate steps. 
<A NAME="322"></A>If, on the other hand, the definition of the starting-points be not laid 
<A NAME="323"></A>down, to show them is difficult and may even prove quite impossible. The 
<A NAME="324"></A>case of the significance of verbal expressions is like that of these mathematical 
<A NAME="325"></A>conceptions.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>One may be sure then, whenever a position is hard to discuss, that 
<A NAME="327"></A>one or other of the aforesaid things has happened to it. Whenever, on the 
<A NAME="328"></A>other hand, it is a harder task to argue to the point claimed, i.e. the 
<A NAME="329"></A>premiss, than to the resulting position, a doubt may arise whether such 
<A NAME="330"></A>claims should be admitted or not: for if a man is going to refuse to admit 
<A NAME="331"></A>it and claim that you shall argue to it as well, he will be giving the 
<A NAME="332"></A>signal for a harder undertaking than was originally proposed: if, on the 
<A NAME="333"></A>other hand, he grants it, he will be giving the original thesis credence 
<A NAME="334"></A>on the strength of what is less credible than itself. If, then, it is essential 
<A NAME="335"></A>not to enhance the difficulty of the problem, he had better grant it; if, 
<A NAME="336"></A>on the other hand, it be essential to reason through premisses that are 
<A NAME="337"></A>better assured, he had better refuse. In other words, in serious inquiry 
<A NAME="338"></A>he ought not to grant it, unless he be more sure about it than about the 
<A NAME="339"></A>conclusion; whereas in a dialectical exercise he may do so if he is merely 
<A NAME="340"></A>satisfied of its truth. Clearly, then, the circumstances under which such 
<A NAME="341"></A>admissions should be claimed are different for a mere questioner and for 
<A NAME="342"></A>a serious teacher.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="343"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>As to the formulation, then, and arrangement of one's questions, 
<A NAME="345"></A>about enough has been said.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>With regard to the giving of answers, we must first define what 
<A NAME="347"></A>is the business of a good answerer, as of a good questioner. The business 
<A NAME="348"></A>of the questioner is so to develop the argument as to make the answerer 
<A NAME="349"></A>utter the most extrvagant paradoxes that necessarily follow because of 
<A NAME="350"></A>his position: while that of the answerer is to make it appear that it is 
<A NAME="351"></A>not he who is responsible for the absurdity or paradox, but only his position: 
<A NAME="352"></A>for one may, perhaps, distinguish between the mistake of taking up a wrong 
<A NAME="353"></A>position to start with, and that of not maintaining it properly, when once 
<A NAME="354"></A>taken up.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="355"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>Inasmuch as no rules are laid down for those who argue for the 
<A NAME="357"></A>sake of training and of examination:-and the aim of those engaged in teaching 
<A NAME="358"></A>or learning is quite different from that of those engaged in a competition; 
<A NAME="359"></A>as is the latter from that of those who discuss things together in the 
<A NAME="360"></A>spirit of inquiry: for a learner should always state what he thinks: for 
<A NAME="361"></A>no one is even trying to teach him what is false; whereas in a competition 
<A NAME="362"></A>the business of the questioner is to appear by all means to produce an 
<A NAME="363"></A>effect upon the other, while that of the answerer is to appear unaffected 
<A NAME="364"></A>by him; on the other hand, in an assembly of disputants discussing in the 
<A NAME="365"></A>spirit not of a competition but of an examination and inquiry, there are 
<A NAME="366"></A>as yet no articulate rules about what the answerer should aim at, and what 
<A NAME="367"></A>kind of things he should and should not grant for the correct or incorrect 
<A NAME="368"></A>defence of his position:-inasmuch, then, as we have no tradition bequeathed 
<A NAME="369"></A>to us by others, let us try to say something upon the matter for 
<A NAME="370"></A>ourselves.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>The thesis laid down by the answerer before facing the questioner's 
<A NAME="372"></A>argument is bound of necessity to be one that is either generally accepted 
<A NAME="373"></A>or generally rejected or else is neither: and moreover is so accepted or 
<A NAME="374"></A>rejected either absolutely or else with a restriction, e.g. by some given 
<A NAME="375"></A>person, by the speaker or by some one else. The manner, however, of its 
<A NAME="376"></A>acceptance or rejection, whatever it be, makes no difference: for the right 
<A NAME="377"></A>way to answer, i.e. to admit or to refuse to admit what has been asked, 
<A NAME="378"></A>will be the same in either case. If, then, the statement laid down by the 
<A NAME="379"></A>answerer be generally rejected, the conclusion aimed at by the questioner 
<A NAME="380"></A>is bound to be one generally accepted, whereas if the former be generally 
<A NAME="381"></A>accepted, the latter is generally rejected: for the conclusion which the 
<A NAME="382"></A>questioner tries to draw is always the opposite of the statement laid down. 
<A NAME="383"></A>If, on the other hand, what is laid down is generally neither rejected 
<A NAME="384"></A>nor accepted, the conclusion will be of the same type as well. Now since 
<A NAME="385"></A>a man who reasons correctly demonstrates his proposed conclusion from premisses 
<A NAME="386"></A>that are more generally accepted, and more familiar, it is clear that (1) 
<A NAME="387"></A>where the view laid down by him is one that generally is absolutely rejected, 
<A NAME="388"></A>the answerer ought not to grant either what is thus absolutely not accepted 
<A NAME="389"></A>at all, or what is accepted indeed, but accepted less generally than the 
<A NAME="390"></A>questioner's conclusion. For if the statement laid down by the answerer 
<A NAME="391"></A>be generally rejected, the conclusion aimed at by the questioner will be 
<A NAME="392"></A>one that is generally accepted, so that the premisses secured by the questioner 
<A NAME="393"></A>should all be views generally accepted, and more generally accepted than 
<A NAME="394"></A>his proposed conclusion, if the less familiar is to be inferred through 
<A NAME="395"></A>the more familiar. Consequently, if any of the questions put to him be 
<A NAME="396"></A>not of this character, the answerer should not grant them. (2) If, on the 
<A NAME="397"></A>other hand, the statement laid down by the answerer be generally accepted 
<A NAME="398"></A>without qualification, clearly the conclusion sought by the questioner 
<A NAME="399"></A>will be one generally rejected without qualification. Accordingly, the 
<A NAME="400"></A>answerer should admit all views that are generally accepted and, of those 
<A NAME="401"></A>that are not generally accepted, all that are less generally rejected than 
<A NAME="402"></A>the conclusion sought by the questioner. For then he will probably be thought 
<A NAME="403"></A>to have argued sufficiently well. (3) Likewise, too, if the statement laid 
<A NAME="404"></A>down by the answerer be neither rejected generally nor generally accepted; 
<A NAME="405"></A>for then, too, anything that appears to be true should be granted, and, 
<A NAME="406"></A>of the views not generally accepted, any that are more generally accepted 
<A NAME="407"></A>than the questioner's conclusion; for in that case the result will be that 
<A NAME="408"></A>the arguments will be more generally accepted. If, then, the view laid 
<A NAME="409"></A>down by the answerer be one that is generally accepted or rejected without 
<A NAME="410"></A>qualification, then the views that are accepted absolutely must be taken 
<A NAME="411"></A>as the standard of comparison: whereas if the view laid down be one that 
<A NAME="412"></A>is not generally accepted or rejected, but only by the answerer, then the 
<A NAME="413"></A>standard whereby the latter must judge what is generally accepted or not, 
<A NAME="414"></A>and must grant or refuse to grant the point asked, is himself. If, again, 
<A NAME="415"></A>the answerer be defending some one else's opinion, then clearly it will 
<A NAME="416"></A>be the latter's judgement to which he must have regard in granting or denying 
<A NAME="417"></A>the various points. This is why those, too, who introduce other's opinions, 
<A NAME="418"></A>e.g. that 'good and evil are the same thing, as Heraclitus says,' refuse 
<A NAME="419"></A>to admit the impossibility of contraries belonging at the same time to 
<A NAME="420"></A>the same thing; not because they do not themselves believe this, but because 
<A NAME="421"></A>on Heraclitus' principles one has to say so. The same thing is done also 
<A NAME="422"></A>by those who take on the defence of one another's positions; their aim 
<A NAME="423"></A>being to speak as would the man who stated the position.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="424"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>It is clear, then, what the aims of the answerer should be, whether 
<A NAME="426"></A>the position he lays down be a view generally accepted without qualification 
<A NAME="427"></A>or accepted by some definite person. Now every question asked is bound 
<A NAME="428"></A>to involve some view that is either generally held or generally rejected 
<A NAME="429"></A>or neither, and is also bound to be either relevant to the argument or 
<A NAME="430"></A>irrelevant: if then it be a view generally accepted and irrelevant, the 
<A NAME="431"></A>answerer should grant it and remark that it is the accepted view: if it 
<A NAME="432"></A>be a view not generally accepted and irrelevant, he should grant it but 
<A NAME="433"></A>add a comment that it is not generally accepted, in order to avoid the 
<A NAME="434"></A>appearance of being a simpleton. If it be relevant and also be generally 
<A NAME="435"></A>accepted, he should admit that it is the view generally accepted but say 
<A NAME="436"></A>that it lies too close to the original proposition, and that if it be granted 
<A NAME="437"></A>the problem proposed collapses. If what is claimed by the questioner be 
<A NAME="438"></A>relevant but too generally rejected, the answerer, while admitting that 
<A NAME="439"></A>if it be granted the conclusion sought follows, should yet protest that 
<A NAME="440"></A>the proposition is too absurd to be admitted. Suppose, again, it be a view 
<A NAME="441"></A>that is neither rejected generally nor generally accepted, then, if it 
<A NAME="442"></A>be irrelevant to the argument, it may be granted without restriction; if, 
<A NAME="443"></A>however, it be relevant, the answerer should add the comment that, if it 
<A NAME="444"></A>be granted, the original problem collapses. For then the answerer will 
<A NAME="445"></A>not be held to be personally accountable for what happens to him, if he 
<A NAME="446"></A>grants the several points with his eyes open, and also the questioner will 
<A NAME="447"></A>be able to draw his inference, seeing that all the premisses that are more 
<A NAME="448"></A>generally accepted than the conclusion are granted him. Those who try to 
<A NAME="449"></A>draw an inference from premisses more generally rejected than the conclusion 
<A NAME="450"></A>clearly do not reason correctly: hence, when men ask these things, they 
<A NAME="451"></A>ought not to be granted.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="452"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR>The questioner should be met in a like manner also in the case 
<A NAME="454"></A>of terms used obscurely, i.e. in several senses. For the answerer, if he 
<A NAME="455"></A>does not understand, is always permitted to say 'I do not understand': 
<A NAME="456"></A>he is not compelled to reply 'Yes' or 'No' to a question which may mean 
<A NAME="457"></A>different things. Clearly, then, in the first place, if what is said be 
<A NAME="458"></A>not clear, he ought not to hesitate to say that he does not understand 
<A NAME="459"></A>it; for often people encounter some difficulty from assenting to questions 
<A NAME="460"></A>that are not clearly put. If he understands the question and yet it covers 
<A NAME="461"></A>many senses, then supposing what it says to be universally true or false, 
<A NAME="462"></A>he should give it an unqualified assent or denial: if, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="463"></A>it be partly true and partly false, he should add a comment that it bears 
<A NAME="464"></A>different senses, and also that in one it is true, in the other false: 
<A NAME="465"></A>for if he leave this distinction till later, it becomes uncertain whether 
<A NAME="466"></A>originally as well he perceived the ambiguity or not. If he does not foresee 
<A NAME="467"></A>the ambiguity, but assents to the question having in view the one sense 
<A NAME="468"></A>of the words, then, if the questioner takes it in the other sense, he should 
<A NAME="469"></A>say, 'That was not what I had in view when I admitted it; I meant the other 
<A NAME="470"></A>sense': for if a term or expression covers more than one thing, it is easy 
<A NAME="471"></A>to disagree. If, however, the question is both clear and simple, he should 
<A NAME="472"></A>answer either 'Yes' or 'No'.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="473"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>A premiss in reasoning always either is one of the constituent 
<A NAME="475"></A>elements in the reasoning, or else goes to establish one of these: (and 
<A NAME="476"></A>you can always tell when it is secured in order to establish something 
<A NAME="477"></A>else by the fact of a number of similar questions being put: for as a rule 
<A NAME="478"></A>people secure their universal by means either of induction or of likeness):-accordingly 
<A NAME="479"></A>the particular propositions should all be admitted, if they are true and 
<A NAME="480"></A>generally held. On the other hand, against the universal one should try 
<A NAME="481"></A>to bring some negative instance; for to bring the argument to a standstill 
<A NAME="482"></A>without a negative instance, either real or apparent, shows ill-temper. 
<A NAME="483"></A>If, then, a man refuses to grant the universal when supported by many instances, 
<A NAME="484"></A>although he has no negative instance to show, he obviously shows ill-temper. 
<A NAME="485"></A>If, moreover, he cannot even attempt a counter-proof that it is not true, 
<A NAME="486"></A>far more likely is he to be thought ill-tempered-although even counter-proof 
<A NAME="487"></A>is not enough: for we often hear arguments that are contrary to common 
<A NAME="488"></A>opinions, whose solution is yet difficult, e.g. the argument of Zeno that 
<A NAME="489"></A>it is impossible to move or to traverse the stadium;-but still, this is 
<A NAME="490"></A>no reason for omitting to assert the opposites of these views. If, then, 
<A NAME="491"></A>a man refuses to admit the proposition without having either a negative 
<A NAME="492"></A>instance or some counter-argument to bring against it, clearly he is ill-tempered: 
<A NAME="493"></A>for ill-temper in argument consists in answering in ways other than the 
<A NAME="494"></A>above, so as to wreck the reasoning.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="495"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>Before maintaining either a thesis or a definition the answerer 
<A NAME="497"></A>should try his hand at attacking it by himself; for clearly his business 
<A NAME="498"></A>is to oppose those positions from which questioners demolish what he has 
<A NAME="499"></A>laid down.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>He should beware of maintaining a hypothesis that is generally 
<A NAME="501"></A>rejected: and this it may be in two ways: for it may be one which results 
<A NAME="502"></A>in absurd statements, e.g. suppose any one were to say that everything 
<A NAME="503"></A>is in motion or that nothing is; and also there are all those which only 
<A NAME="504"></A>a bad character would choose, and which are implicitly opposed to men's 
<A NAME="505"></A>wishes, e.g. that pleasure is the good, and that to do injustice is better 
<A NAME="506"></A>than to suffer it. For people then hate him, supposing him to maintain 
<A NAME="507"></A>them not for the sake of argument but because he really thinks 
<A NAME="508"></A>them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="509"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>Of all arguments that reason to a false conclusion the right solution 
<A NAME="511"></A>is to demolish the point on which the fallacy that occurs depends: for 
<A NAME="512"></A>the demolition of any random point is no solution, even though the point 
<A NAME="513"></A>demolished be false. For the argument may contain many falsehoods, e.g. 
<A NAME="514"></A>suppose some one to secure the premisses, 'He who sits, writes' and 'Socrates 
<A NAME="515"></A>is sitting': for from these it follows that 'Socrates is writing'. Now 
<A NAME="516"></A>we may demolish the proposition 'Socrates is sitting', and still be no 
<A NAME="517"></A>nearer a solution of the argument; it may be true that the point claimed 
<A NAME="518"></A>is false; but it is not on that that fallacy of the argument depends: for 
<A NAME="519"></A>supposing that any one should happen to be sitting and not writing, it 
<A NAME="520"></A>would be impossible in such a case to apply the same solution. Accordingly, 
<A NAME="521"></A>it is not this that needs to be demolished, but rather that 'He who sits, 
<A NAME="522"></A>writes': for he who sits does not always write. He, then, who has demolished 
<A NAME="523"></A>the point on which the fallacy depends, has given the solution of the argument 
<A NAME="524"></A>completely. Any one who knows that it is on such and such a point that 
<A NAME="525"></A>the argument depends, knows the solution of it, just as in the case of 
<A NAME="526"></A>a figure falsely drawn. For it is not enough to object, even if the point 
<A NAME="527"></A>demolished be a falsehood, but the reason of the fallacy should also be 
<A NAME="528"></A>proved: for then it would be clear whether the man makes his objection 
<A NAME="529"></A>with his eyes open or not.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>There are four possible ways of preventing a man from working his 
<A NAME="531"></A>argument to a conclusion. It can be done either by demolishing the point 
<A NAME="532"></A>on which the falsehood that comes about depends, or by stating an objection 
<A NAME="533"></A>directed against the questioner: for often when a solution has not as a 
<A NAME="534"></A>matter of fact been brought, yet the questioner is rendered thereby unable 
<A NAME="535"></A>to pursue the argument any farther. Thirdly, one may object to the questions 
<A NAME="536"></A>asked: for it may happen that what the questioner wants does not follow 
<A NAME="537"></A>from the questions he has asked because he has asked them badly, whereas 
<A NAME="538"></A>if something additional be granted the conclusion comes about. If, then, 
<A NAME="539"></A>the questioner be unable to pursue his argument farther, the objection 
<A NAME="540"></A>would properly be directed against the questioner; if he can do so, then 
<A NAME="541"></A>it would be against his questions. The fourth and worst kind of objection 
<A NAME="542"></A>is that which is directed to the time allowed for discussion: for some 
<A NAME="543"></A>people bring objections of a kind which would take longer to answer than 
<A NAME="544"></A>the length of the discussion in hand.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>There are then, as we said, four ways of making objections: but 
<A NAME="546"></A>of them the first alone is a solution: the others are just hindrances and 
<A NAME="547"></A>stumbling-blocks to prevent the conclusions.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="548"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>Adverse criticism of an argument on its own merits, and of it when 
<A NAME="550"></A>presented in the form of questions, are two different things. For often 
<A NAME="551"></A>the failure to carry through the argument correctly in discussion is due 
<A NAME="552"></A>to the person questioned, because he will not grant the steps of which 
<A NAME="553"></A>a correct argument might have been made against his position: for it is 
<A NAME="554"></A>not in the power of the one side only to effect properly a result that 
<A NAME="555"></A>depends on both alike. Accordingly it sometimes becomes necessary to attack 
<A NAME="556"></A>the speaker and not his position, when the answerer lies in wait for the 
<A NAME="557"></A>points that are contrary to the questioner and becomes abusive as well: 
<A NAME="558"></A>when people lose their tempers in this way, their argument becomes a contest, 
<A NAME="559"></A>not a discussion. Moreover, since arguments of this kind are held not for 
<A NAME="560"></A>the sake of instruction but for purposes of practice and examination, clearly 
<A NAME="561"></A>one has to reason not only to true conclusions, but also to false ones, 
<A NAME="562"></A>and not always through true premisses, but sometimes through false as well. 
<A NAME="563"></A>For often, when a true proposition is put forward, the dialectician is 
<A NAME="564"></A>compelled to demolish it: and then false propositions have to be formulated. 
<A NAME="565"></A>Sometimes also when a false proposition is put forward, it has to be demolished 
<A NAME="566"></A>by means of false propositions: for it is possible for a given man to believe 
<A NAME="567"></A>what is not the fact more firmly than the truth. Accordingly, if the argument 
<A NAME="568"></A>be made to depend on something that he holds, it will be easier to persuade 
<A NAME="569"></A>or help him. He, however, who would rightly convert any one to a different 
<A NAME="570"></A>opinion should do so in a dialectical and not in a contentious manner, 
<A NAME="571"></A>just as a geometrician should reason geometrically, whether his conclusion 
<A NAME="572"></A>be false or true: what kind of syllogisms are dialectical has already been 
<A NAME="573"></A>said. The principle that a man who hinders the common business is a bad 
<A NAME="574"></A>partner, clearly applies to an argument as well; for in arguments as well 
<A NAME="575"></A>there is a common aim in view, except with mere contestants, for these 
<A NAME="576"></A>cannot both reach the same goal; for more than one cannot possibly win. 
<A NAME="577"></A>It makes no difference whether he effects this as answerer or as questioner: 
<A NAME="578"></A>for both he who asks contentious questions is a bad dialectician, and also 
<A NAME="579"></A>he who in answering fails to grant the obvious answer or to understand 
<A NAME="580"></A>the point of the questioner's inquiry. What has been said, then, makes 
<A NAME="581"></A>it clear that adverse criticism is not to be passed in a like strain upon 
<A NAME="582"></A>the argument on its own merits, and upon the questioner: for it may very 
<A NAME="583"></A>well be that the argument is bad, but that the questioner has argued with 
<A NAME="584"></A>the answerer in the best possible way: for when men lose their tempers, 
<A NAME="585"></A>it may perhaps be impossible to make one's inferences straight-forwardly 
<A NAME="586"></A>as one would wish: we have to do as we can.
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR>Inasmuch as it is indeterminate when people are claiming the admission 
<A NAME="588"></A>of contrary things, and when they are claiming what originally they set 
<A NAME="589"></A>out to prove-for often when they are talking by themselves they say contrary 
<A NAME="590"></A>things, and admit afterwards what they have previously denied; for which 
<A NAME="591"></A>reason they often assent, when questioned, to contrary things and to what 
<A NAME="592"></A>originally had to be proved-the argument is sure to become vitiated. The 
<A NAME="593"></A>responsibility, however, for this rests with the answerer, because while 
<A NAME="594"></A>refusing to grant other points, he does grant points of that kind. It is, 
<A NAME="595"></A>then, clear that adverse criticism is not to be passed in a like manner 
<A NAME="596"></A>upon questioners and upon their arguments.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>In itself an argument is liable to five kinds of adverse 
<A NAME="598"></A>criticism:
<A NAME="599"></A><BR>(1) The first is when neither the proposed conclusion nor indeed any 
<A NAME="600"></A>conclusion at all is drawn from the questions asked, and when most, if 
<A NAME="601"></A>not all, of the premisses on which the conclusion rests are false or generally 
<A NAME="602"></A>rejected, when, moreover, neither any withdrawals nor additions nor both 
<A NAME="603"></A>together can bring the conclusions about.
<A NAME="604"></A><BR><BR>(2) The second is, supposing the reasoning, though constructed 
<A NAME="605"></A>from the premisses, and in the manner, described above, were to be irrelevant 
<A NAME="606"></A>to the original position.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>(3) The third is, supposing certain additions would bring an inference 
<A NAME="608"></A>about but yet these additions were to be weaker than those that were put 
<A NAME="609"></A>as questions and less generally held than the conclusion.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>(4) Again, supposing certain withdrawals could effect the same: 
<A NAME="611"></A>for sometimes people secure more premisses than are necessary, so that 
<A NAME="612"></A>it is not through them that the inference comes about.
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR>(5) Moreover, suppose the premisses be less generally held and 
<A NAME="614"></A>less credible than the conclusion, or if, though true, they require more 
<A NAME="615"></A>trouble to prove than the proposed view.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>One must not claim that the reasoning to a proposed view shall 
<A NAME="617"></A>in every case equally be a view generally accepted and convincing: for 
<A NAME="618"></A>it is a direct result of the nature of things that some subjects of inquiry 
<A NAME="619"></A>shall be easier and some harder, so that if a man brings people to accept 
<A NAME="620"></A>his point from opinions that are as generally received as the case admits, 
<A NAME="621"></A>he has argued his case correctly. Clearly, then, not even the argument 
<A NAME="622"></A>itself is open to the same adverse criticism when taken in relation to 
<A NAME="623"></A>the proposed conclusion and when taken by itself. For there is nothing 
<A NAME="624"></A>to prevent the argument being open to reproach in itself, and yet commendable 
<A NAME="625"></A>in relation to the proposed conclusion, or again, vice versa, being commendable 
<A NAME="626"></A>in itself, and yet open to reproach in relation to the proposed conclusion, 
<A NAME="627"></A>whenever there are many propositions both generally held and also true 
<A NAME="628"></A>whereby it could easily be proved. It is possible also that an argument, 
<A NAME="629"></A>even though brought to a conclusion, may sometimes be worse than one which 
<A NAME="630"></A>is not so concluded, whenever the premisses of the former are silly, while 
<A NAME="631"></A>its conclusion is not so; whereas the latter, though requiring certain 
<A NAME="632"></A>additions, requires only such as are generally held and true, and moreover 
<A NAME="633"></A>does not rest as an argument on these additions. With those which bring 
<A NAME="634"></A>about a true conclusion by means of false premisses, it is not fair to 
<A NAME="635"></A>find fault: for a false conclusion must of necessity always be reached 
<A NAME="636"></A>from a false premiss, but a true conclusion may sometimes be drawn even 
<A NAME="637"></A>from false premisses; as is clear from the Analytics.
<A NAME="638"></A><BR><BR>Whenever by the argument stated something is demonstrated, but 
<A NAME="639"></A>that something is other than what is wanted and has no bearing whatever 
<A NAME="640"></A>on the conclusion, then no inference as to the latter can be drawn from 
<A NAME="641"></A>it: and if there appears to be, it will be a sophism, not a proof. A philosopheme 
<A NAME="642"></A>is a demonstrative inference: an epichireme is a dialectical inference: 
<A NAME="643"></A>a sophism is a contentious inference: an aporeme is an inference that reasons 
<A NAME="644"></A>dialectically to a contradiction.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR>If something were to be shown from premisses, both of which are 
<A NAME="646"></A>views generally accepted, but not accepted with like conviction, it may 
<A NAME="647"></A>very well be that the conclusion shown is something held more strongly 
<A NAME="648"></A>than either. If, on the other hand, general opinion be for the one and 
<A NAME="649"></A>neither for nor against the other, or if it be for the one and against 
<A NAME="650"></A>the other, then, if the pro and con be alike in the case of the premisses, 
<A NAME="651"></A>they will be alike for the conclusion also: if, on the other hand, the 
<A NAME="652"></A>one preponderates, the conclusion too will follow suit.
<A NAME="653"></A><BR><BR>It is also a fault in reasoning when a man shows something through 
<A NAME="654"></A>a long chain of steps, when he might employ fewer steps and those already 
<A NAME="655"></A>included in his argument: suppose him to be showing (e.g.) that one opinion 
<A NAME="656"></A>is more properly so called than another, and suppose him to make his postulates 
<A NAME="657"></A>as follows: 'x-in-itself is more fully x than anything else': 'there genuinely 
<A NAME="658"></A>exists an object of opinion in itself': therefore 'the object-of-opinion-in-itself 
<A NAME="659"></A>is more fully an object of opinion than the particular objects of opinion'. 
<A NAME="660"></A>Now 'a relative term is more fully itself when its correlate is more fully 
<A NAME="661"></A>itself': and 'there exists a genuine opinion-in-itself, which will be "opinion" 
<A NAME="662"></A>in a more accurate sense than the particular opinions': and it has been 
<A NAME="663"></A>postulated both that 'a genuine opinion-in-itself exists', and that 'x-in-itself 
<A NAME="664"></A>is more fully x than anything else': therefore 'this will be opinion in 
<A NAME="665"></A>a more accurate sense'. Wherein lies the viciousness of the reasoning? 
<A NAME="666"></A>Simply in that it conceals the ground on which the argument 
<A NAME="667"></A>depends.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="668"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>An argument is clear in one, and that the most ordinary, sense, 
<A NAME="670"></A>if it be so brought to a conclusion as to make no further questions necessary: 
<A NAME="671"></A>in another sense, and this is the type most usually advanced, when the 
<A NAME="672"></A>propositions secured are such as compel the conclusion, and the argument 
<A NAME="673"></A>is concluded through premisses that are themselves conclusions: moreover, 
<A NAME="674"></A>it is so also if some step is omitted that generally is firmly 
<A NAME="675"></A>accepted.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR>An argument is called fallacious in four senses: (1) when it appears 
<A NAME="677"></A>to be brought to a conclusion, and is not really so-what is called 'contentious' 
<A NAME="678"></A>reasoning: (2) when it comes to a conclusion but not to the conclusion 
<A NAME="679"></A>proposed-which happens principally in the case of reductiones ad impossibile: 
<A NAME="680"></A>(3) when it comes to the proposed conclusion but not according to the mode 
<A NAME="681"></A>of inquiry appropriate to the case, as happens when a non-medical argument 
<A NAME="682"></A>is taken to be a medical one, or one which is not geometrical for a geometrical 
<A NAME="683"></A>argument, or one which is not dialectical for dialectical, whether the 
<A NAME="684"></A>result reached be true or false: (4) if the conclusion be reached through 
<A NAME="685"></A>false premisses: of this type the conclusion is sometimes false, sometimes 
<A NAME="686"></A>true: for while a false conclusion is always the result of false premisses, 
<A NAME="687"></A>a true conclusion may be drawn even from premisses that are not true, as 
<A NAME="688"></A>was said above as well.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR><BR>Fallacy in argument is due to a mistake of the arguer rather than 
<A NAME="690"></A>of the argument: yet it is not always the fault of the arguer either, but 
<A NAME="691"></A>only when he is not aware of it: for we often accept on its merits in preference 
<A NAME="692"></A>to many true ones an argument which demolishes some true proposition if 
<A NAME="693"></A>it does so from premisses as far as possible generally accepted. For an 
<A NAME="694"></A>argument of that kind does demonstrate other things that are true: for 
<A NAME="695"></A>one of the premisses laid down ought never to be there at all, and this 
<A NAME="696"></A>will then be demonstrated. If, however, a true conclusion were to be reached 
<A NAME="697"></A>through premisses that are false and utterly childish, the argument is 
<A NAME="698"></A>worse than many arguments that lead to a false conclusion, though an argument 
<A NAME="699"></A>which leads to a false conclusion may also be of this type. Clearly then 
<A NAME="700"></A>the first thing to ask in regard to the argument in itself is, 'Has it 
<A NAME="701"></A>a conclusion?'; the second, 'Is the conclusion true or false?'; the third, 
<A NAME="702"></A>'Of what kind of premisses does it consist?': for if the latter, though 
<A NAME="703"></A>false, be generally accepted, the argument is dialectical, whereas if, 
<A NAME="704"></A>though true, they be generally rejected, it is bad: if they be both false 
<A NAME="705"></A>and also entirely contrary to general opinion, clearly it is bad, either 
<A NAME="706"></A>altogether or else in relation to the particular matter in 
<A NAME="707"></A>hand.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="708"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR>Of the ways in which a questioner may beg the original question 
<A NAME="710"></A>and also beg contraries the true account has been given in the Analytics:' 
<A NAME="711"></A>but an account on the level of general opinion must be given 
<A NAME="712"></A>now.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR>People appear to beg their original question in five ways: the 
<A NAME="714"></A>first and most obvious being if any one begs the actual point requiring 
<A NAME="715"></A>to be shown: this is easily detected when put in so many words; but it 
<A NAME="716"></A>is more apt to escape detection in the case of different terms, or a term 
<A NAME="717"></A>and an expression, that mean the same thing. A second way occurs whenever 
<A NAME="718"></A>any one begs universally something which he has to demonstrate in a particular 
<A NAME="719"></A>case: suppose (e.g.) he were trying to prove that the knowledge of contraries 
<A NAME="720"></A>is one and were to claim that the knowledge of opposites in general is 
<A NAME="721"></A>one: for then he is generally thought to be begging, along with a number 
<A NAME="722"></A>of other things, that which he ought to have shown by itself. A third way 
<A NAME="723"></A>is if any one were to beg in particular cases what he undertakes to show 
<A NAME="724"></A>universally: e.g. if he undertook to show that the knowledge of contraries 
<A NAME="725"></A>is always one, and begged it of certain pairs of contraries: for he also 
<A NAME="726"></A>is generally considered to be begging independently and by itself what, 
<A NAME="727"></A>together with a number of other things, he ought to have shown. Again, 
<A NAME="728"></A>a man begs the question if he begs his conclusion piecemeal: supposing 
<A NAME="729"></A>e.g. that he had to show that medicine is a science of what leads to health 
<A NAME="730"></A>and to disease, and were to claim first the one, then the other; or, fifthly, 
<A NAME="731"></A>if he were to beg the one or the other of a pair of statements that necessarily 
<A NAME="732"></A>involve one other; e.g. if he had to show that the diagonal is incommensurable 
<A NAME="733"></A>with the side, and were to beg that the side is incommensurable with the 
<A NAME="734"></A>diagonal.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR><BR>The ways in which people assume contraries are equal in number 
<A NAME="736"></A>to those in which they beg their original question. For it would happen, 
<A NAME="737"></A>firstly, if any one were to beg an opposite affirmation and negation; secondly, 
<A NAME="738"></A>if he were to beg the contrary terms of an antithesis, e.g. that the same 
<A NAME="739"></A>thing is good and evil; thirdly, suppose any one were to claim something 
<A NAME="740"></A>universally and then proceed to beg its contradictory in some particular 
<A NAME="741"></A>case, e.g. if having secured that the knowledge of contraries is one, he 
<A NAME="742"></A>were to claim that the knowledge of what makes for health or for disease 
<A NAME="743"></A>is different; or, fourthly, suppose him, after postulating the latter view, 
<A NAME="744"></A>to try to secure universally the contradictory statement. Again, fifthly, 
<A NAME="745"></A>suppose a man begs the contrary of the conclusion which necessarily comes 
<A NAME="746"></A>about through the premisses laid down; and this would happen suppose, even 
<A NAME="747"></A>without begging the opposites in so many words, he were to beg two premisses 
<A NAME="748"></A>such that this contradictory statement that is opposite to the first conclusion 
<A NAME="749"></A>will follow from them. The securing of contraries differs from begging 
<A NAME="750"></A>the original question in this way: in the latter case the mistake lies 
<A NAME="751"></A>in regard to the conclusion; for it is by a glance at the conclusion that 
<A NAME="752"></A>we tell that the original question has been begged: whereas contrary views 
<A NAME="753"></A>lie in the premisses, viz. in a certain relation which they bear to one 
<A NAME="754"></A>another.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="755"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>The best way to secure training and practice in arguments of this 
<A NAME="757"></A>kind is in the first place to get into the habit of converting the arguments. 
<A NAME="758"></A>For in this way we shall be better equipped for dealing with the proposition 
<A NAME="759"></A>stated, and after a few attempts we shall know several arguments by heart. 
<A NAME="760"></A>For by 'conversion' of an argument is meant the taking the reverse of the 
<A NAME="761"></A>conclusion together with the remaining propositions asked and so demolishing 
<A NAME="762"></A>one of those that were conceded: for it follows necessarily that if the 
<A NAME="763"></A>conclusion be untrue, some one of the premisses is demolished, seeing that, 
<A NAME="764"></A>given all the premisses, the conclusion was bound to follow. Always, in 
<A NAME="765"></A>dealing with any proposition, be on the look-out for a line of argument 
<A NAME="766"></A>both pro and con: and on discovering it at once set about looking for the 
<A NAME="767"></A>solution of it: for in this way you will soon find that you have trained 
<A NAME="768"></A>yourself at the same time in both asking questions and answering them. 
<A NAME="769"></A>If we cannot find any one else to argue with, we should argue with ourselves. 
<A NAME="770"></A>Select, moreover, arguments relating to the same thesis and range them 
<A NAME="771"></A>side by side: for this produces a plentiful supply of arguments for carrying 
<A NAME="772"></A>a point by sheer force, and in refutation also it is of great service, 
<A NAME="773"></A>whenever one is well stocked with arguments pro and con: for then you find 
<A NAME="774"></A>yourself on your guard against contrary statements to the one you wish 
<A NAME="775"></A>to secure. Moreover, as contributing to knowledge and to philosophic wisdom 
<A NAME="776"></A>the power of discerning and holding in one view the results of either of 
<A NAME="777"></A>two hypotheses is no mean instrument; for it then only remains to make 
<A NAME="778"></A>a right choice of one of them. For a task of this kind a certain natural 
<A NAME="779"></A>ability is required: in fact real natural ability just is the power right 
<A NAME="780"></A>to choose the true and shun the false. Men of natural ability can do this; 
<A NAME="781"></A>for by a right liking or disliking for whatever is proposed to them they 
<A NAME="782"></A>rightly select what is best.
<A NAME="783"></A><BR><BR>It is best to know by heart arguments upon those questions which 
<A NAME="784"></A>are of most frequent occurrence, and particularly in regard to those propositions 
<A NAME="785"></A>which are ultimate: for in discussing these answerers frequently give up 
<A NAME="786"></A>in despair. Moreover, get a good stock of definitions: and have those of 
<A NAME="787"></A>familiar and primary ideas at your fingers' ends: for it is through these 
<A NAME="788"></A>that reasonings are effected. You should try, moreover, to master the heads 
<A NAME="789"></A>under which other arguments mostly tend to fall. For just as in geometry 
<A NAME="790"></A>it is useful to be practised in the elements, and in arithmetic to have 
<A NAME="791"></A>the multiplication table up to ten at one's fingers' ends-and indeed it 
<A NAME="792"></A>makes a great difference in one's knowledge of the multiples of other numbers 
<A NAME="793"></A>too-likewise also in arguments it is a great advantage to be well up in 
<A NAME="794"></A>regard to first principles, and to have a thorough knowledge of premisses 
<A NAME="795"></A>at the tip of one's tongue. For just as in a person with a trained memory, 
<A NAME="796"></A>a memory of things themselves is immediately caused by the mere mention 
<A NAME="797"></A>of their loci, so these habits too will make a man readier in reasoning, 
<A NAME="798"></A>because he has his premisses classified before his mind's eye, each under 
<A NAME="799"></A>its number. It is better to commit to memory a premiss of general application 
<A NAME="800"></A>than an argument: for it is difficult to be even moderately ready with 
<A NAME="801"></A>a first principle, or hypothesis.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, you should get into the habit of turning one argument 
<A NAME="803"></A>into several, and conceal your procedure as darkly as you can: this kind 
<A NAME="804"></A>of effect is best produced by keeping as far as possible away from topics 
<A NAME="805"></A>akin to the subject of the argument. This can be done with arguments that 
<A NAME="806"></A>are entirely universal, e.g. the statement that 'there cannot be one knowledge 
<A NAME="807"></A>of more than one thing': for that is the case with both relative terms 
<A NAME="808"></A>and contraries and co-ordinates.
<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR>Records of discussions should be made in a universal form, even 
<A NAME="810"></A>though one has argued only some particular case: for this will enable one 
<A NAME="811"></A>to turn a single rule into several. A like rule applies in Rhetoric as 
<A NAME="812"></A>well to enthymemes. For yourself, however, you should as far as possible 
<A NAME="813"></A>avoid universalizing your reasonings. You should, moreover, always examine 
<A NAME="814"></A>arguments to see whether they rest on principles of general application: 
<A NAME="815"></A>for all particular arguments really reason universally, as well, i.e. a 
<A NAME="816"></A>particular demonstration always contains a universal demonstration, because 
<A NAME="817"></A>it is impossible to reason at all without using universals.
<A NAME="818"></A><BR><BR>You should display your training in inductive reasoning against 
<A NAME="819"></A>a young man, in deductive against an expert. You should try, moreover, 
<A NAME="820"></A>to secure from those skilled in deduction their premisses, from inductive 
<A NAME="821"></A>reasoners their parallel cases; for this is the thing in which they are 
<A NAME="822"></A>respectively trained. In general, too, from your exercises in argumentation 
<A NAME="823"></A>you should try to carry away either a syllogism on some subject or a refutation 
<A NAME="824"></A>or a proposition or an objection, or whether some one put his question 
<A NAME="825"></A>properly or improperly (whether it was yourself or some one else) and the 
<A NAME="826"></A>point which made it the one or the other. For this is what gives one ability, 
<A NAME="827"></A>and the whole object of training is to acquire ability, especially in regard 
<A NAME="828"></A>to propositions and objections. For it is the skilled propounder and objector 
<A NAME="829"></A>who is, speaking generally, a dialectician. To formulate a proposition 
<A NAME="830"></A>is to form a number of things into one-for the conclusion to which the 
<A NAME="831"></A>argument leads must be taken generally, as a single thing-whereas to formulate 
<A NAME="832"></A>an objection is to make one thing into many; for the objector either distinguishes 
<A NAME="833"></A>or demolishes, partly granting, partly denying the statements 
<A NAME="834"></A>proposed.
<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>Do not argue with every one, nor practise upon the man in the street: 
<A NAME="836"></A>for there are some people with whom any argument is bound to degenerate. 
<A NAME="837"></A>For against any one who is ready to try all means in order to seem not 
<A NAME="838"></A>to be beaten, it is indeed fair to try all means of bringing about one's 
<A NAME="839"></A>conclusion: but it is not good form. Wherefore the best rule is, not lightly 
<A NAME="840"></A>to engage with casual acquaintances, or bad argument is sure to result. 
<A NAME="841"></A>For you see how in practising together people cannot refrain from contentious 
<A NAME="842"></A>argument.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR>It is best also to have ready-made arguments relating to those 
<A NAME="844"></A>questions in which a very small stock will furnish us with arguments serviceable 
<A NAME="845"></A>on a very large number of occasions. These are those that are universal, 
<A NAME="846"></A>and those in regard to which it is rather difficult to produce points for 
<A NAME="847"></A>ourselves from matters of everyday experience.
