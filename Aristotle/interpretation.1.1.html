<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>First we must define the terms 'noun' and 'verb', then the terms 'denial' 
<A NAME="12"></A>and 'affirmation', then 'proposition' and 'sentence.'
<A NAME="13"></A><BR><BR>Spoken words are the symbols of mental experience and written words 
<A NAME="14"></A>are the symbols of spoken words. Just as all men have not the same writing, 
<A NAME="15"></A>so all men have not the same speech sounds, but the mental experiences, 
<A NAME="16"></A>which these directly symbolize, are the same for all, as also are those 
<A NAME="17"></A>things of which our experiences are the images. This matter has, however, 
<A NAME="18"></A>been discussed in my treatise about the soul, for it belongs to an investigation 
<A NAME="19"></A>distinct from that which lies before us.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>As there are in the mind thoughts which do not involve truth or 
<A NAME="21"></A>falsity, and also those which must be either true or false, so it is in 
<A NAME="22"></A>speech. For truth and falsity imply combination and separation. Nouns and 
<A NAME="23"></A>verbs, provided nothing is added, are like thoughts without combination 
<A NAME="24"></A>or separation; 'man' and 'white', as isolated terms, are not yet either 
<A NAME="25"></A>true or false. In proof of this, consider the word 'goat-stag.' It has 
<A NAME="26"></A>significance, but there is no truth or falsity about it, unless 'is' or 
<A NAME="27"></A>'is not' is added, either in the present or in some other 
<A NAME="28"></A>tense.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="29"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>By a noun we mean a sound significant by convention, which has 
<A NAME="31"></A>no reference to time, and of which no part is significant apart from the 
<A NAME="32"></A>rest. In the noun 'Fairsteed,' the part 'steed' has no significance in 
<A NAME="33"></A>and by itself, as in the phrase 'fair steed.' Yet there is a difference 
<A NAME="34"></A>between simple and composite nouns; for in the former the part is in no 
<A NAME="35"></A>way significant, in the latter it contributes to the meaning of the whole, 
<A NAME="36"></A>although it has not an independent meaning. Thus in the word 'pirate-boat' 
<A NAME="37"></A>the word 'boat' has no meaning except as part of the whole 
<A NAME="38"></A>word.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>The limitation 'by convention' was introduced because nothing is 
<A NAME="40"></A>by nature a noun or name-it is only so when it becomes a symbol; inarticulate 
<A NAME="41"></A>sounds, such as those which brutes produce, are significant, yet none of 
<A NAME="42"></A>these constitutes a noun.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>The expression 'not-man' is not a noun. There is indeed no recognized 
<A NAME="44"></A>term by which we may denote such an expression, for it is not a sentence 
<A NAME="45"></A>or a denial. Let it then be called an indefinite noun.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>The expressions 'of Philo', 'to Philo', and so on, constitute not 
<A NAME="47"></A>nouns, but cases of a noun. The definition of these cases of a noun is 
<A NAME="48"></A>in other respects the same as that of the noun proper, but, when coupled 
<A NAME="49"></A>with 'is', 'was', or will be', they do not, as they are, form a proposition 
<A NAME="50"></A>either true or false, and this the noun proper always does, under these 
<A NAME="51"></A>conditions. Take the words 'of Philo is' or 'of or 'of Philo is not'; these 
<A NAME="52"></A>words do not, as they stand, form either a true or a false 
<A NAME="53"></A>proposition.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="54"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>A verb is that which, in addition to its proper meaning, carries 
<A NAME="56"></A>with it the notion of time. No part of it has any independent meaning, 
<A NAME="57"></A>and it is a sign of something said of something else.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>I will explain what I mean by saying that it carries with it the 
<A NAME="59"></A>notion of time. 'Health' is a noun, but 'is healthy' is a verb; for besides 
<A NAME="60"></A>its proper meaning it indicates the present existence of the state in 
<A NAME="61"></A>question.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, a verb is always a sign of something said of something 
<A NAME="63"></A>else, i.e. of something either predicable of or present in some other 
<A NAME="64"></A>thing.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>Such expressions as 'is not-healthy', 'is not, ill', I do not describe 
<A NAME="66"></A>as verbs; for though they carry the additional note of time, and always 
<A NAME="67"></A>form a predicate, there is no specified name for this variety; but let 
<A NAME="68"></A>them be called indefinite verbs, since they apply equally well to that 
<A NAME="69"></A>which exists and to that which does not.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>Similarly 'he was healthy', 'he will be healthy', are not verbs, 
<A NAME="71"></A>but tenses of a verb; the difference lies in the fact that the verb indicates 
<A NAME="72"></A>present time, while the tenses of the verb indicate those times which lie 
<A NAME="73"></A>outside the present.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>Verbs in and by themselves are substantival and have significance, 
<A NAME="75"></A>for he who uses such expressions arrests the hearer's mind, and fixes his 
<A NAME="76"></A>attention; but they do not, as they stand, express any judgement, either 
<A NAME="77"></A>positive or negative. For neither are 'to be' and 'not to be' the participle 
<A NAME="78"></A>'being' significant of any fact, unless something is added; for they do 
<A NAME="79"></A>not themselves indicate anything, but imply a copulation, of which we cannot 
<A NAME="80"></A>form a conception apart from the things coupled.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="81"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>A sentence is a significant portion of speech, some parts of which 
<A NAME="83"></A>have an independent meaning, that is to say, as an utterance, though not 
<A NAME="84"></A>as the expression of any positive judgement. Let me explain. The word 'human' 
<A NAME="85"></A>has meaning, but does not constitute a proposition, either positive or 
<A NAME="86"></A>negative. It is only when other words are added that the whole will form 
<A NAME="87"></A>an affirmation or denial. But if we separate one syllable of the word 'human' 
<A NAME="88"></A>from the other, it has no meaning; similarly in the word 'mouse', the part 
<A NAME="89"></A>'ouse' has no meaning in itself, but is merely a sound. In composite words, 
<A NAME="90"></A>indeed, the parts contribute to the meaning of the whole; yet, as has been 
<A NAME="91"></A>pointed out, they have not an independent meaning.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>Every sentence has meaning, not as being the natural means by which 
<A NAME="93"></A>a physical faculty is realized, but, as we have said, by convention. Yet 
<A NAME="94"></A>every sentence is not a proposition; only such are propositions as have 
<A NAME="95"></A>in them either truth or falsity. Thus a prayer is a sentence, but is neither 
<A NAME="96"></A>true nor false.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>Let us therefore dismiss all other types of sentence but the proposition, 
<A NAME="98"></A>for this last concerns our present inquiry, whereas the investigation of 
<A NAME="99"></A>the others belongs rather to the study of rhetoric or of 
<A NAME="100"></A>poetry.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="101"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>The first class of simple propositions is the simple affirmation, 
<A NAME="103"></A>the next, the simple denial; all others are only one by 
<A NAME="104"></A>conjunction.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>Every proposition must contain a verb or the tense of a verb. The 
<A NAME="106"></A>phrase which defines the species 'man', if no verb in present, past, or 
<A NAME="107"></A>future time be added, is not a proposition. It may be asked how the expression 
<A NAME="108"></A>'a footed animal with two feet' can be called single; for it is not the 
<A NAME="109"></A>circumstance that the words follow in unbroken succession that effects 
<A NAME="110"></A>the unity. This inquiry, however, finds its place in an investigation foreign 
<A NAME="111"></A>to that before us.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>We call those propositions single which indicate a single fact, 
<A NAME="113"></A>or the conjunction of the parts of which results in unity: those propositions, 
<A NAME="114"></A>on the other hand, are separate and many in number, which indicate many 
<A NAME="115"></A>facts, or whose parts have no conjunction.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>Let us, moreover, consent to call a noun or a verb an expression 
<A NAME="117"></A>only, and not a proposition, since it is not possible for a man to speak 
<A NAME="118"></A>in this way when he is expressing something, in such a way as to make a 
<A NAME="119"></A>statement, whether his utterance is an answer to a question or an act of 
<A NAME="120"></A>his own initiation.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>To return: of propositions one kind is simple, i.e. that which 
<A NAME="122"></A>asserts or denies something of something, the other composite, i.e. that 
<A NAME="123"></A>which is compounded of simple propositions. A simple proposition is a statement, 
<A NAME="124"></A>with meaning, as to the presence of something in a subject or its absence, 
<A NAME="125"></A>in the present, past, or future, according to the divisions of 
<A NAME="126"></A>time.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="127"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>An affirmation is a positive assertion of something about something, 
<A NAME="129"></A>a denial a negative assertion.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>Now it is possible both to affirm and to deny the presence of something 
<A NAME="131"></A>which is present or of something which is not, and since these same affirmations 
<A NAME="132"></A>and denials are possible with reference to those times which lie outside 
<A NAME="133"></A>the present, it would be possible to contradict any affirmation or denial. 
<A NAME="134"></A>Thus it is plain that every affirmation has an opposite denial, and similarly 
<A NAME="135"></A>every denial an opposite affirmation.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>We will call such a pair of propositions a pair of contradictories. 
<A NAME="137"></A>Those positive and negative propositions are said to be contradictory which 
<A NAME="138"></A>have the same subject and predicate. The identity of subject and of predicate 
<A NAME="139"></A>must not be 'equivocal'. Indeed there are definitive qualifications besides 
<A NAME="140"></A>this, which we make to meet the casuistries of sophists.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="141"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>Some things are universal, others individual. By the term 'universal' 
<A NAME="143"></A>I mean that which is of such a nature as to be predicated of many subjects, 
<A NAME="144"></A>by 'individual' that which is not thus predicated. Thus 'man' is a universal, 
<A NAME="145"></A>'Callias' an individual.
<A NAME="146"></A><BR><BR>Our propositions necessarily sometimes concern a universal subject, 
<A NAME="147"></A>sometimes an individual.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>If, then, a man states a positive and a negative proposition of 
<A NAME="149"></A>universal character with regard to a universal, these two propositions 
<A NAME="150"></A>are 'contrary'. By the expression 'a proposition of universal character 
<A NAME="151"></A>with regard to a universal', such propositions as 'every man is white', 
<A NAME="152"></A>'no man is white' are meant. When, on the other hand, the positive and 
<A NAME="153"></A>negative propositions, though they have regard to a universal, are yet 
<A NAME="154"></A>not of universal character, they will not be contrary, albeit the meaning 
<A NAME="155"></A>intended is sometimes contrary. As instances of propositions made with 
<A NAME="156"></A>regard to a universal, but not of universal character, we may take the 
<A NAME="157"></A>'propositions 'man is white', 'man is not white'. 'Man' is a universal, 
<A NAME="158"></A>but the proposition is not made as of universal character; for the word 
<A NAME="159"></A>'every' does not make the subject a universal, but rather gives the proposition 
<A NAME="160"></A>a universal character. If, however, both predicate and subject are distributed, 
<A NAME="161"></A>the proposition thus constituted is contrary to truth; no affirmation will, 
<A NAME="162"></A>under such circumstances, be true. The proposition 'every man is every 
<A NAME="163"></A>animal' is an example of this type.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>An affirmation is opposed to a denial in the sense which I denote 
<A NAME="165"></A>by the term 'contradictory', when, while the subject remains the same, 
<A NAME="166"></A>the affirmation is of universal character and the denial is not. The affirmation 
<A NAME="167"></A>'every man is white' is the contradictory of the denial 'not every man 
<A NAME="168"></A>is white', or again, the proposition 'no man is white' is the contradictory 
<A NAME="169"></A>of the proposition 'some men are white'. But propositions are opposed as 
<A NAME="170"></A>contraries when both the affirmation and the denial are universal, as in 
<A NAME="171"></A>the sentences 'every man is white', 'no man is white', 'every man is just', 
<A NAME="172"></A>'no man is just'.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>We see that in a pair of this sort both propositions cannot be 
<A NAME="174"></A>true, but the contradictories of a pair of contraries can sometimes both 
<A NAME="175"></A>be true with reference to the same subject; for instance 'not every man 
<A NAME="176"></A>is white' and some men are white' are both true. Of such corresponding 
<A NAME="177"></A>positive and negative propositions as refer to universals and have a universal 
<A NAME="178"></A>character, one must be true and the other false. This is the case also 
<A NAME="179"></A>when the reference is to individuals, as in the propositions 'Socrates 
<A NAME="180"></A>is white', 'Socrates is not white'.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>When, on the other hand, the reference is to universals, but the 
<A NAME="182"></A>propositions are not universal, it is not always the case that one is true 
<A NAME="183"></A>and the other false, for it is possible to state truly that man is white 
<A NAME="184"></A>and that man is not white and that man is beautiful and that man is not 
<A NAME="185"></A>beautiful; for if a man is deformed he is the reverse of beautiful, also 
<A NAME="186"></A>if he is progressing towards beauty he is not yet beautiful.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>This statement might seem at first sight to carry with it a contradiction, 
<A NAME="188"></A>owing to the fact that the proposition 'man is not white' appears to be 
<A NAME="189"></A>equivalent to the proposition 'no man is white'. This, however, is not 
<A NAME="190"></A>the case, nor are they necessarily at the same time true or 
<A NAME="191"></A>false.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>It is evident also that the denial corresponding to a single affirmation 
<A NAME="193"></A>is itself single; for the denial must deny just that which the affirmation 
<A NAME="194"></A>affirms concerning the same subject, and must correspond with the affirmation 
<A NAME="195"></A>both in the universal or particular character of the subject and in the 
<A NAME="196"></A>distributed or undistributed sense in which it is understood.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>For instance, the affirmation 'Socrates is white' has its proper 
<A NAME="198"></A>denial in the proposition 'Socrates is not white'. If anything else be 
<A NAME="199"></A>negatively predicated of the subject or if anything else be the subject 
<A NAME="200"></A>though the predicate remain the same, the denial will not be the denial 
<A NAME="201"></A>proper to that affirmation, but on that is distinct.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>The denial proper to the affirmation 'every man is white' is 'not 
<A NAME="203"></A>every man is white'; that proper to the affirmation 'some men are white' 
<A NAME="204"></A>is 'no man is white', while that proper to the affirmation 'man is white' 
<A NAME="205"></A>is 'man is not white'.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>We have shown further that a single denial is contradictorily opposite 
<A NAME="207"></A>to a single affirmation and we have explained which these are; we have 
<A NAME="208"></A>also stated that contrary are distinct from contradictory propositions 
<A NAME="209"></A>and which the contrary are; also that with regard to a pair of opposite 
<A NAME="210"></A>propositions it is not always the case that one is true and the other false. 
<A NAME="211"></A>We have pointed out, moreover, what the reason of this is and under what 
<A NAME="212"></A>circumstances the truth of the one involves the falsity of the 
<A NAME="213"></A>other.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="214"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>An affirmation or denial is single, if it indicates some one fact 
<A NAME="216"></A>about some one subject; it matters not whether the subject is universal 
<A NAME="217"></A>and whether the statement has a universal character, or whether this is 
<A NAME="218"></A>not so. Such single propositions are: 'every man is white', 'not every 
<A NAME="219"></A>man is white';'man is white','man is not white'; 'no man is white', 'some 
<A NAME="220"></A>men are white'; provided the word 'white' has one meaning. If, on the other 
<A NAME="221"></A>hand, one word has two meanings which do not combine to form one, the affirmation 
<A NAME="222"></A>is not single. For instance, if a man should establish the symbol 'garment' 
<A NAME="223"></A>as significant both of a horse and of a man, the proposition 'garment is 
<A NAME="224"></A>white' would not be a single affirmation, nor its opposite a single denial. 
<A NAME="225"></A>For it is equivalent to the proposition 'horse and man are white', which, 
<A NAME="226"></A>again, is equivalent to the two propositions 'horse is white', 'man is 
<A NAME="227"></A>white'. If, then, these two propositions have more than a single significance, 
<A NAME="228"></A>and do not form a single proposition, it is plain that the first proposition 
<A NAME="229"></A>either has more than one significance or else has none; for a particular 
<A NAME="230"></A>man is not a horse.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>This, then, is another instance of those propositions of which 
<A NAME="232"></A>both the positive and the negative forms may be true or false 
<A NAME="233"></A>simultaneously.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="234"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>In the case of that which is or which has taken place, propositions, 
<A NAME="236"></A>whether positive or negative, must be true or false. Again, in the case 
<A NAME="237"></A>of a pair of contradictories, either when the subject is universal and 
<A NAME="238"></A>the propositions are of a universal character, or when it is individual, 
<A NAME="239"></A>as has been said,' one of the two must be true and the other false; whereas 
<A NAME="240"></A>when the subject is universal, but the propositions are not of a universal 
<A NAME="241"></A>character, there is no such necessity. We have discussed this type also 
<A NAME="242"></A>in a previous chapter.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>When the subject, however, is individual, and that which is predicated 
<A NAME="244"></A>of it relates to the future, the case is altered. For if all propositions 
<A NAME="245"></A>whether positive or negative are either true or false, then any given predicate 
<A NAME="246"></A>must either belong to the subject or not, so that if one man affirms that 
<A NAME="247"></A>an event of a given character will take place and another denies it, it 
<A NAME="248"></A>is plain that the statement of the one will correspond with reality and 
<A NAME="249"></A>that of the other will not. For the predicate cannot both belong and not 
<A NAME="250"></A>belong to the subject at one and the same time with regard to the 
<A NAME="251"></A>future.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>Thus, if it is true to say that a thing is white, it must necessarily 
<A NAME="253"></A>be white; if the reverse proposition is true, it will of necessity not 
<A NAME="254"></A>be white. Again, if it is white, the proposition stating that it is white 
<A NAME="255"></A>was true; if it is not white, the proposition to the opposite effect was 
<A NAME="256"></A>true. And if it is not white, the man who states that it is making a false 
<A NAME="257"></A>statement; and if the man who states that it is white is making a false 
<A NAME="258"></A>statement, it follows that it is not white. It may therefore be argued 
<A NAME="259"></A>that it is necessary that affirmations or denials must be either true or 
<A NAME="260"></A>false.
<A NAME="261"></A><BR><BR>Now if this be so, nothing is or takes place fortuitously, either 
<A NAME="262"></A>in the present or in the future, and there are no real alternatives; everything 
<A NAME="263"></A>takes place of necessity and is fixed. For either he that affirms that 
<A NAME="264"></A>it will take place or he that denies this is in correspondence with fact, 
<A NAME="265"></A>whereas if things did not take place of necessity, an event might just 
<A NAME="266"></A>as easily not happen as happen; for the meaning of the word 'fortuitous' 
<A NAME="267"></A>with regard to present or future events is that reality is so constituted 
<A NAME="268"></A>that it may issue in either of two opposite directions. Again, if a thing 
<A NAME="269"></A>is white now, it was true before to say that it would be white, so that 
<A NAME="270"></A>of anything that has taken place it was always true to say 'it is' or 'it 
<A NAME="271"></A>will be'. But if it was always true to say that a thing is or will be, 
<A NAME="272"></A>it is not possible that it should not be or not be about to be, and when 
<A NAME="273"></A>a thing cannot not come to be, it is impossible that it should not come 
<A NAME="274"></A>to be, and when it is impossible that it should not come to be, it must 
<A NAME="275"></A>come to be. All, then, that is about to be must of necessity take place. 
<A NAME="276"></A>It results from this that nothing is uncertain or fortuitous, for if it 
<A NAME="277"></A>were fortuitous it would not be necessary.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>Again, to say that neither the affirmation nor the denial is true, 
<A NAME="279"></A>maintaining, let us say, that an event neither will take place nor will 
<A NAME="280"></A>not take place, is to take up a position impossible to defend. In the first 
<A NAME="281"></A>place, though facts should prove the one proposition false, the opposite 
<A NAME="282"></A>would still be untrue. Secondly, if it was true to say that a thing was 
<A NAME="283"></A>both white and large, both these qualities must necessarily belong to it; 
<A NAME="284"></A>and if they will belong to it the next day, they must necessarily belong 
<A NAME="285"></A>to it the next day. But if an event is neither to take place nor not to 
<A NAME="286"></A>take place the next day, the element of chance will be eliminated. For 
<A NAME="287"></A>example, it would be necessary that a sea-fight should neither take place 
<A NAME="288"></A>nor fail to take place on the next day.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>These awkward results and others of the same kind follow, if it 
<A NAME="290"></A>is an irrefragable law that of every pair of contradictory propositions, 
<A NAME="291"></A>whether they have regard to universals and are stated as universally applicable, 
<A NAME="292"></A>or whether they have regard to individuals, one must be true and the other 
<A NAME="293"></A>false, and that there are no real alternatives, but that all that is or 
<A NAME="294"></A>takes place is the outcome of necessity. There would be no need to deliberate 
<A NAME="295"></A>or to take trouble, on the supposition that if we should adopt a certain 
<A NAME="296"></A>course, a certain result would follow, while, if we did not, the result 
<A NAME="297"></A>would not follow. For a man may predict an event ten thousand years beforehand, 
<A NAME="298"></A>and another may predict the reverse; that which was truly predicted at 
<A NAME="299"></A>the moment in the past will of necessity take place in the fullness of 
<A NAME="300"></A>time.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>Further, it makes no difference whether people have or have not 
<A NAME="302"></A>actually made the contradictory statements. For it is manifest that the 
<A NAME="303"></A>circumstances are not influenced by the fact of an affirmation or denial 
<A NAME="304"></A>on the part of anyone. For events will not take place or fail to take place 
<A NAME="305"></A>because it was stated that they would or would not take place, nor is this 
<A NAME="306"></A>any more the case if the prediction dates back ten thousand years or any 
<A NAME="307"></A>other space of time. Wherefore, if through all time the nature of things 
<A NAME="308"></A>was so constituted that a prediction about an event was true, then through 
<A NAME="309"></A>all time it was necessary that that should find fulfillment; and with regard 
<A NAME="310"></A>to all events, circumstances have always been such that their occurrence 
<A NAME="311"></A>is a matter of necessity. For that of which someone has said truly that 
<A NAME="312"></A>it will be, cannot fail to take place; and of that which takes place, it 
<A NAME="313"></A>was always true to say that it would be.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>Yet this view leads to an impossible conclusion; for we see that 
<A NAME="315"></A>both deliberation and action are causative with regard to the future, and 
<A NAME="316"></A>that, to speak more generally, in those things which are not continuously 
<A NAME="317"></A>actual there is potentiality in either direction. Such things may either 
<A NAME="318"></A>be or not be; events also therefore may either take place or not take place. 
<A NAME="319"></A>There are many obvious instances of this. It is possible that this coat 
<A NAME="320"></A>may be cut in half, and yet it may not be cut in half, but wear out first. 
<A NAME="321"></A>In the same way, it is possible that it should not be cut in half; unless 
<A NAME="322"></A>this were so, it would not be possible that it should wear out first. So 
<A NAME="323"></A>it is therefore with all other events which possess this kind of potentiality. 
<A NAME="324"></A>It is therefore plain that it is not of necessity that everything is or 
<A NAME="325"></A>takes place; but in some instances there are real alternatives, in which 
<A NAME="326"></A>case the affirmation is no more true and no more false than the denial; 
<A NAME="327"></A>while some exhibit a predisposition and general tendency in one direction 
<A NAME="328"></A>or the other, and yet can issue in the opposite direction by 
<A NAME="329"></A>exception.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>Now that which is must needs be when it is, and that which is not 
<A NAME="331"></A>must needs not be when it is not. Yet it cannot be said without qualification 
<A NAME="332"></A>that all existence and non-existence is the outcome of necessity. For there 
<A NAME="333"></A>is a difference between saying that that which is, when it is, must needs 
<A NAME="334"></A>be, and simply saying that all that is must needs be, and similarly in 
<A NAME="335"></A>the case of that which is not. In the case, also, of two contradictory 
<A NAME="336"></A>propositions this holds good. Everything must either be or not be, whether 
<A NAME="337"></A>in the present or in the future, but it is not always possible to distinguish 
<A NAME="338"></A>and state determinately which of these alternatives must necessarily come 
<A NAME="339"></A>about.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>Let me illustrate. A sea-fight must either take place to-morrow 
<A NAME="341"></A>or not, but it is not necessary that it should take place to-morrow, neither 
<A NAME="342"></A>is it necessary that it should not take place, yet it is necessary that 
<A NAME="343"></A>it either should or should not take place to-morrow. Since propositions 
<A NAME="344"></A>correspond with facts, it is evident that when in future events there is 
<A NAME="345"></A>a real alternative, and a potentiality in contrary directions, the corresponding 
<A NAME="346"></A>affirmation and denial have the same character.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>This is the case with regard to that which is not always existent 
<A NAME="348"></A>or not always nonexistent. One of the two propositions in such instances 
<A NAME="349"></A>must be true and the other false, but we cannot say determinately that 
<A NAME="350"></A>this or that is false, but must leave the alternative undecided. One may 
<A NAME="351"></A>indeed be more likely to be true than the other, but it cannot be either 
<A NAME="352"></A>actually true or actually false. It is therefore plain that it is not necessary 
<A NAME="353"></A>that of an affirmation and a denial one should be true and the other false. 
<A NAME="354"></A>For in the case of that which exists potentially, but not actually, the 
<A NAME="355"></A>rule which applies to that which exists actually does not hold good. The 
<A NAME="356"></A>case is rather as we have indicated.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="357"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>An affirmation is the statement of a fact with regard to a subject, 
<A NAME="359"></A>and this subject is either a noun or that which has no name; the subject 
<A NAME="360"></A>and predicate in an affirmation must each denote a single thing. I have 
<A NAME="361"></A>already explained' what is meant by a noun and by that which has no name; 
<A NAME="362"></A>for I stated that the expression 'not-man' was not a noun, in the proper 
<A NAME="363"></A>sense of the word, but an indefinite noun, denoting as it does in a certain 
<A NAME="364"></A>sense a single thing. Similarly the expression 'does not enjoy health' 
<A NAME="365"></A>is not a verb proper, but an indefinite verb. Every affirmation, then, 
<A NAME="366"></A>and every denial, will consist of a noun and a verb, either definite or 
<A NAME="367"></A>indefinite.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>There can be no affirmation or denial without a verb; for the expressions 
<A NAME="369"></A>'is', 'will be', 'was', 'is coming to be', and the like are verbs according 
<A NAME="370"></A>to our definition, since besides their specific meaning they convey the 
<A NAME="371"></A>notion of time. Thus the primary affirmation and denial are 'as follows: 
<A NAME="372"></A>'man is', 'man is not'. Next to these, there are the propositions: 'not-man 
<A NAME="373"></A>is', 'not-man is not'. Again we have the propositions: 'every man is, 'every 
<A NAME="374"></A>man is not', 'all that is not-man is', 'all that is not-man is not'. The 
<A NAME="375"></A>same classification holds good with regard to such periods of time as lie 
<A NAME="376"></A>outside the present.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>When the verb 'is' is used as a third element in the sentence, 
<A NAME="378"></A>there can be positive and negative propositions of two sorts. Thus in the 
<A NAME="379"></A>sentence 'man is just' the verb 'is' is used as a third element, call it 
<A NAME="380"></A>verb or noun, which you will. Four propositions, therefore, instead of 
<A NAME="381"></A>two can be formed with these materials. Two of the four, as regards their 
<A NAME="382"></A>affirmation and denial, correspond in their logical sequence with the propositions 
<A NAME="383"></A>which deal with a condition of privation; the other two do not correspond 
<A NAME="384"></A>with these.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>I mean that the verb 'is' is added either to the term 'just' or 
<A NAME="386"></A>to the term 'not-just', and two negative propositions are formed in the 
<A NAME="387"></A>same way. Thus we have the four propositions. Reference to the subjoined 
<A NAME="388"></A>table will make matters clear:
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR><B>A. Affirmation        B. Denial</B> <B>Man is just       Man 
<A NAME="390"></A>is not just</B> <B>\   /</B> <B>X</B> <B>/   \</B> <B>D. Denial 
<A NAME="391"></A>            C. Affirmation</B> <B>Man is not not-just     Man is not-just</B> 
<A NAME="392"></A>Here 'is' and 'is not' are added either to 'just' or to 'not-just'. This 
<A NAME="393"></A>then is the proper scheme for these propositions, as has been said in the 
<A NAME="394"></A>Analytics. The same rule holds good, if the subject is distributed. Thus 
<A NAME="395"></A>we have the table:
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR><B>A'. Affirmation               B'. Denial</B> <B>Every man is 
<A NAME="397"></A>just           Not every man is just</B> <B>\   /</B> <B>X</B> <B>D'. Denial 
<A NAME="398"></A>         /   \     C'. Affirmation</B>
<A NAME="399"></A><BR>Not every man is not-just        Every man is not-just Yet here it 
<A NAME="400"></A>is not possible, in the same way as in the former case, that the propositions 
<A NAME="401"></A>joined in the table by a diagonal line should both be true; though under 
<A NAME="402"></A>certain circumstances this is the case.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>We have thus set out two pairs of opposite propositions; there 
<A NAME="404"></A>are moreover two other pairs, if a term be conjoined with 'not-man', the 
<A NAME="405"></A>latter forming a kind of subject. Thus:
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR><B>A."                            B."</B> <B>Not-man is just 
<A NAME="407"></A>              Not-man is not just</B> <B>\   /</B> - 
<A NAME="408"></A>                               X
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR><B>D."              /   \         C."</B> <B>Not-man is not not-just 
<A NAME="410"></A>      Not-man is not-just</B>
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>This is an exhaustive enumeration of all the pairs of opposite 
<A NAME="412"></A>propositions that can possibly be framed. This last group should remain 
<A NAME="413"></A>distinct from those which preceded it, since it employs as its subject 
<A NAME="414"></A>the expression 'not-man'.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>When the verb 'is' does not fit the structure of the sentence (for 
<A NAME="416"></A>instance, when the verbs 'walks', 'enjoys health' are used), that scheme 
<A NAME="417"></A>applies, which applied when the word 'is' was added.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>Thus we have the propositions: 'every man enjoys health', 'every 
<A NAME="419"></A>man does-not-enjoy-health', 'all that is not-man enjoys health', 'all that 
<A NAME="420"></A>is not-man does-not-enjoy-health'. We must not in these propositions use 
<A NAME="421"></A>the expression 'not every man'. The negative must be attached to the word 
<A NAME="422"></A>'man', for the word 'every' does not give to the subject a universal significance, 
<A NAME="423"></A>but implies that, as a subject, it is distributed. This is plain from the 
<A NAME="424"></A>following pairs: 'man enjoys health', 'man does not enjoy health'; 'not-man 
<A NAME="425"></A>enjoys health', 'not man does not enjoy health'. These propositions differ 
<A NAME="426"></A>from the former in being indefinite and not universal in character. Thus 
<A NAME="427"></A>the adjectives 'every' and no additional significance except that the subject, 
<A NAME="428"></A>whether in a positive or in a negative sentence, is distributed. The rest 
<A NAME="429"></A>of the sentence, therefore, will in each case be the 
<A NAME="430"></A>same.
<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR>Since the contrary of the proposition 'every animal is just' is 
<A NAME="432"></A>'no animal is just', it is plain that these two propositions will never 
<A NAME="433"></A>both be true at the same time or with reference to the same subject. Sometimes, 
<A NAME="434"></A>however, the contradictories of these contraries will both be true, as 
<A NAME="435"></A>in the instance before us: the propositions 'not every animal is just' 
<A NAME="436"></A>and 'some animals are just' are both true.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>Further, the proposition 'no man is just' follows from the proposition 
<A NAME="438"></A>'every man is not just' and the proposition 'not every man is not just', 
<A NAME="439"></A>which is the opposite of 'every man is not-just', follows from the proposition 
<A NAME="440"></A>'some men are just'; for if this be true, there must be some just 
<A NAME="441"></A>men.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>It is evident, also, that when the subject is individual, if a 
<A NAME="443"></A>question is asked and the negative answer is the true one, a certain positive 
<A NAME="444"></A>proposition is also true. Thus, if the question were asked Socrates wise?' 
<A NAME="445"></A>and the negative answer were the true one, the positive inference 'Then 
<A NAME="446"></A>Socrates is unwise' is correct. But no such inference is correct in the 
<A NAME="447"></A>case of universals, but rather a negative proposition. For instance, if 
<A NAME="448"></A>to the question 'Is every man wise?' the answer is 'no', the inference 
<A NAME="449"></A>'Then every man is unwise' is false. But under these circumstances the 
<A NAME="450"></A>inference 'Not every man is wise' is correct. This last is the contradictory, 
<A NAME="451"></A>the former the contrary. Negative expressions, which consist of an indefinite 
<A NAME="452"></A>noun or predicate, such as 'not-man' or 'not-just', may seem to be denials 
<A NAME="453"></A>containing neither noun nor verb in the proper sense of the words. But 
<A NAME="454"></A>they are not. For a denial must always be either true or false, and he 
<A NAME="455"></A>that uses the expression 'not man', if nothing more be added, is not nearer 
<A NAME="456"></A>but rather further from making a true or a false statement than he who 
<A NAME="457"></A>uses the expression 'man'.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR>The propositions 'everything that is not man is just', and the 
<A NAME="459"></A>contradictory of this, are not equivalent to any of the other propositions; 
<A NAME="460"></A>on the other hand, the proposition 'everything that is not man is not just' 
<A NAME="461"></A>is equivalent to the proposition 'nothing that is not man is 
<A NAME="462"></A>just'.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>The conversion of the position of subject and predicate in a sentence 
<A NAME="464"></A>involves no difference in its meaning. Thus we say 'man is white' and 'white 
<A NAME="465"></A>is man'. If these were not equivalent, there would be more than one contradictory 
<A NAME="466"></A>to the same proposition, whereas it has been demonstrated' that each proposition 
<A NAME="467"></A>has one proper contradictory and one only. For of the proposition 'man 
<A NAME="468"></A>is white' the appropriate contradictory is 'man is not white', and of the 
<A NAME="469"></A>proposition 'white is man', if its meaning be different, the contradictory 
<A NAME="470"></A>will either be 'white is not not-man' or 'white is not man'. Now the former 
<A NAME="471"></A>of these is the contradictory of the proposition 'white is not-man', and 
<A NAME="472"></A>the latter of these is the contradictory of the proposition 'man is white'; 
<A NAME="473"></A>thus there will be two contradictories to one proposition.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>It is evident, therefore, that the inversion of the relative position 
<A NAME="475"></A>of subject and predicate does not affect the sense of affirmations and 
<A NAME="476"></A>denials.
