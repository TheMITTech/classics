<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Now if the terms 'continuous', 'in contact', and 'in succession' are understood 
<A NAME="12"></A>as defined above things being 'continuous' if their extremities are one, 
<A NAME="13"></A>'in contact' if their extremities are together, and 'in succession' if 
<A NAME="14"></A>there is nothing of their own kind intermediate between them-nothing that 
<A NAME="15"></A>is continuous can be composed 'of indivisibles': e.g. a line cannot be 
<A NAME="16"></A>composed of points, the line being continuous and the point indivisible. 
<A NAME="17"></A>For the extremities of two points can neither be one (since of an indivisible 
<A NAME="18"></A>there can be no extremity as distinct from some other part) nor together 
<A NAME="19"></A>(since that which has no parts can have no extremity, the extremity and 
<A NAME="20"></A>the thing of which it is the extremity being distinct).
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, if that which is continuous is composed of points, these 
<A NAME="22"></A>points must be either continuous or in contact with one another: and the 
<A NAME="23"></A>same reasoning applies in the case of all indivisibles. Now for the reason 
<A NAME="24"></A>given above they cannot be continuous: and one thing can be in contact 
<A NAME="25"></A>with another only if whole is in contact with whole or part with part or 
<A NAME="26"></A>part with whole. But since indivisibles have no parts, they must be in 
<A NAME="27"></A>contact with one another as whole with whole. And if they are in contact 
<A NAME="28"></A>with one another as whole with whole, they will not be continuous: for 
<A NAME="29"></A>that which is continuous has distinct parts: and these parts into which 
<A NAME="30"></A>it is divisible are different in this way, i.e. spatially 
<A NAME="31"></A>separate.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>Nor, again, can a point be in succession to a point or a moment 
<A NAME="33"></A>to a moment in such a way that length can be composed of points or time 
<A NAME="34"></A>of moments: for things are in succession if there is nothing of their own 
<A NAME="35"></A>kind intermediate between them, whereas that which is intermediate between 
<A NAME="36"></A>points is always a line and that which is intermediate between moments 
<A NAME="37"></A>is always a period of time.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>Again, if length and time could thus be composed of indivisibles, 
<A NAME="39"></A>they could be divided into indivisibles, since each is divisible into the 
<A NAME="40"></A>parts of which it is composed. But, as we saw, no continuous thing is divisible 
<A NAME="41"></A>into things without parts. Nor can there be anything of any other kind 
<A NAME="42"></A>intermediate between the parts or between the moments: for if there could 
<A NAME="43"></A>be any such thing it is clear that it must be either indivisible or divisible, 
<A NAME="44"></A>and if it is divisible, it must be divisible either into indivisibles or 
<A NAME="45"></A>into divisibles that are infinitely divisible, in which case it is 
<A NAME="46"></A>continuous.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, it is plain that everything continuous is divisible into 
<A NAME="48"></A>divisibles that are infinitely divisible: for if it were divisible into 
<A NAME="49"></A>indivisibles, we should have an indivisible in contact with an indivisible, 
<A NAME="50"></A>since the extremities of things that are continuous with one another are 
<A NAME="51"></A>one and are in contact.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>The same reasoning applies equally to magnitude, to time, and to 
<A NAME="53"></A>motion: either all of these are composed of indivisibles and are divisible 
<A NAME="54"></A>into indivisibles, or none. This may be made clear as follows. If a magnitude 
<A NAME="55"></A>is composed of indivisibles, the motion over that magnitude must be composed 
<A NAME="56"></A>of corresponding indivisible motions: e.g. if the magnitude ABG is composed 
<A NAME="57"></A>of the indivisibles A, B, G, each corresponding part of the motion DEZ 
<A NAME="58"></A>of O over ABG is indivisible. Therefore, since where there is motion there 
<A NAME="59"></A>must be something that is in motion, and where there is something in motion 
<A NAME="60"></A>there must be motion, therefore the being-moved will also be composed of 
<A NAME="61"></A>indivisibles. So O traversed A when its motion was D, B when its motion 
<A NAME="62"></A>was E, and G similarly when its motion was Z. Now a thing that is in motion 
<A NAME="63"></A>from one place to another cannot at the moment when it was in motion both 
<A NAME="64"></A>be in motion and at the same time have completed its motion at the place 
<A NAME="65"></A>to which it was in motion: e.g. if a man is walking to Thebes, he cannot 
<A NAME="66"></A>be walking to Thebes and at the same time have completed his walk to Thebes: 
<A NAME="67"></A>and, as we saw, O traverses a the partless section A in virtue of the presence 
<A NAME="68"></A>of the motion D. Consequently, if O actually passed through A after being 
<A NAME="69"></A>in process of passing through, the motion must be divisible: for at the 
<A NAME="70"></A>time when O was passing through, it neither was at rest nor had completed 
<A NAME="71"></A>its passage but was in an intermediate state: while if it is passing through 
<A NAME="72"></A>and has completed its passage at the same moment, then that which is walking 
<A NAME="73"></A>will at the moment when it is walking have completed its walk and will 
<A NAME="74"></A>be in the place to which it is walking; that is to say, it will have completed 
<A NAME="75"></A>its motion at the place to which it is in motion. And if a thing is in 
<A NAME="76"></A>motion over the whole Kbg and its motion is the three D, E, and Z, and 
<A NAME="77"></A>if it is not in motion at all over the partless section A but has completed 
<A NAME="78"></A>its motion over it, then the motion will consist not of motions but of 
<A NAME="79"></A>starts, and will take place by a thing's having completed a motion without 
<A NAME="80"></A>being in motion: for on this assumption it has completed its passage through 
<A NAME="81"></A>A without passing through it. So it will be possible for a thing to have 
<A NAME="82"></A>completed a walk without ever walking: for on this assumption it has completed 
<A NAME="83"></A>a walk over a particular distance without walking over that distance. Since, 
<A NAME="84"></A>then, everything must be either at rest or in motion, and O is therefore 
<A NAME="85"></A>at rest in each of the sections A, B, and G, it follows that a thing can 
<A NAME="86"></A>be continuously at rest and at the same time in motion: for, as we saw, 
<A NAME="87"></A>O is in motion over the whole ABG and at rest in any part (and consequently 
<A NAME="88"></A>in the whole) of it. Moreover, if the indivisibles composing DEZ are motions, 
<A NAME="89"></A>it would be possible for a thing in spite of the presence in it of motion 
<A NAME="90"></A>to be not in motion but at rest, while if they are not motions, it would 
<A NAME="91"></A>be possible for motion to be composed of something other than 
<A NAME="92"></A>motions.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>And if length and motion are thus indivisible, it is neither more 
<A NAME="94"></A>nor less necessary that time also be similarly indivisible, that is to 
<A NAME="95"></A>say be composed of indivisible moments: for if the whole distance is divisible 
<A NAME="96"></A>and an equal velocity will cause a thing to pass through less of it in 
<A NAME="97"></A>less time, the time must also be divisible, and conversely, if the time 
<A NAME="98"></A>in which a thing is carried over the section A is divisible, this section 
<A NAME="99"></A>A must also be divisible.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="100"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>And since every magnitude is divisible into magnitudes-for we have 
<A NAME="102"></A>shown that it is impossible for anything continuous to be composed of indivisible 
<A NAME="103"></A>parts, and every magnitude is continuous-it necessarily follows that the 
<A NAME="104"></A>quicker of two things traverses a greater magnitude in an equal time, an 
<A NAME="105"></A>equal magnitude in less time, and a greater magnitude in less time, in 
<A NAME="106"></A>conformity with the definition sometimes given of 'the quicker'. Suppose 
<A NAME="107"></A>that A is quicker than B. Now since of two things that which changes sooner 
<A NAME="108"></A>is quicker, in the time ZH, in which A has changed from G to D, B will 
<A NAME="109"></A>not yet have arrived at D but will be short of it: so that in an equal 
<A NAME="110"></A>time the quicker will pass over a greater magnitude. More than this, it 
<A NAME="111"></A>will pass over a greater magnitude in less time: for in the time in which 
<A NAME="112"></A>A has arrived at D, B being the slower has arrived, let us say, at E. Then 
<A NAME="113"></A>since A has occupied the whole time ZH in arriving at D, will have arrived 
<A NAME="114"></A>at O in less time than this, say ZK. Now the magnitude GO that A has passed 
<A NAME="115"></A>over is greater than the magnitude GE, and the time ZK is less than the 
<A NAME="116"></A>whole time ZH: so that the quicker will pass over a greater magnitude in 
<A NAME="117"></A>less time. And from this it is also clear that the quicker will pass over 
<A NAME="118"></A>an equal magnitude in less time than the slower. For since it passes over 
<A NAME="119"></A>the greater magnitude in less time than the slower, and (regarded by itself) 
<A NAME="120"></A>passes over LM the greater in more time than LX the lesser, the time PRh 
<A NAME="121"></A>in which it passes over LM will be more than the time PS, which it passes 
<A NAME="122"></A>over LX: so that, the time PRh being less than the time PCh in which the 
<A NAME="123"></A>slower passes over LX, the time PS will also be less than the time PX: 
<A NAME="124"></A>for it is less than the time PRh, and that which is less than something 
<A NAME="125"></A>else that is less than a thing is also itself less than that thing. Hence 
<A NAME="126"></A>it follows that the quicker will traverse an equal magnitude in less time 
<A NAME="127"></A>than the slower. Again, since the motion of anything must always occupy 
<A NAME="128"></A>either an equal time or less or more time in comparison with that of another 
<A NAME="129"></A>thing, and since, whereas a thing is slower if its motion occupies more 
<A NAME="130"></A>time and of equal velocity if its motion occupies an equal time, the quicker 
<A NAME="131"></A>is neither of equal velocity nor slower, it follows that the motion of 
<A NAME="132"></A>the quicker can occupy neither an equal time nor more time. It can only 
<A NAME="133"></A>be, then, that it occupies less time, and thus we get the necessary consequence 
<A NAME="134"></A>that the quicker will pass over an equal magnitude (as well as a greater) 
<A NAME="135"></A>in less time than the slower.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>And since every motion is in time and a motion may occupy any time, 
<A NAME="137"></A>and the motion of everything that is in motion may be either quicker or 
<A NAME="138"></A>slower, both quicker motion and slower motion may occupy any time: and 
<A NAME="139"></A>this being so, it necessarily follows that time also is continuous. By 
<A NAME="140"></A>continuous I mean that which is divisible into divisibles that are infinitely 
<A NAME="141"></A>divisible: and if we take this as the definition of continuous, it follows 
<A NAME="142"></A>necessarily that time is continuous. For since it has been shown that the 
<A NAME="143"></A>quicker will pass over an equal magnitude in less time than the slower, 
<A NAME="144"></A>suppose that A is quicker and B slower, and that the slower has traversed 
<A NAME="145"></A>the magnitude GD in the time ZH. Now it is clear that the quicker will 
<A NAME="146"></A>traverse the same magnitude in less time than this: let us say in the time 
<A NAME="147"></A>ZO. Again, since the quicker has passed over the whole D in the time ZO, 
<A NAME="148"></A>the slower will in the same time pass over GK, say, which is less than 
<A NAME="149"></A>GD. And since B, the slower, has passed over GK in the time ZO, the quicker 
<A NAME="150"></A>will pass over it in less time: so that the time ZO will again be divided. 
<A NAME="151"></A>And if this is divided the magnitude GK will also be divided just as GD 
<A NAME="152"></A>was: and again, if the magnitude is divided, the time will also be divided. 
<A NAME="153"></A>And we can carry on this process for ever, taking the slower after the 
<A NAME="154"></A>quicker and the quicker after the slower alternately, and using what has 
<A NAME="155"></A>been demonstrated at each stage as a new point of departure: for the quicker 
<A NAME="156"></A>will divide the time and the slower will divide the length. If, then, this 
<A NAME="157"></A>alternation always holds good, and at every turn involves a division, it 
<A NAME="158"></A>is evident that all time must be continuous. And at the same time it is 
<A NAME="159"></A>clear that all magnitude is also continuous; for the divisions of which 
<A NAME="160"></A>time and magnitude respectively are susceptible are the same and 
<A NAME="161"></A>equal.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, the current popular arguments make it plain that, if 
<A NAME="163"></A>time is continuous, magnitude is continuous also, inasmuch as a thing asses 
<A NAME="164"></A>over half a given magnitude in half the time taken to cover the whole: 
<A NAME="165"></A>in fact without qualification it passes over a less magnitude in less time; 
<A NAME="166"></A>for the divisions of time and of magnitude will be the same. And if either 
<A NAME="167"></A>is infinite, so is the other, and the one is so in the same way as the 
<A NAME="168"></A>other; i.e. if time is infinite in respect of its extremities, length is 
<A NAME="169"></A>also infinite in respect of its extremities: if time is infinite in respect 
<A NAME="170"></A>of divisibility, length is also infinite in respect of divisibility: and 
<A NAME="171"></A>if time is infinite in both respects, magnitude is also infinite in both 
<A NAME="172"></A>respects.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>Hence Zeno's argument makes a false assumption in asserting that 
<A NAME="174"></A>it is impossible for a thing to pass over or severally to come in contact 
<A NAME="175"></A>with infinite things in a finite time. For there are two senses in which 
<A NAME="176"></A>length and time and generally anything continuous are called 'infinite': 
<A NAME="177"></A>they are called so either in respect of divisibility or in respect of their 
<A NAME="178"></A>extremities. So while a thing in a finite time cannot come in contact with 
<A NAME="179"></A>things quantitatively infinite, it can come in contact with things infinite 
<A NAME="180"></A>in respect of divisibility: for in this sense the time itself is also infinite: 
<A NAME="181"></A>and so we find that the time occupied by the passage over the infinite 
<A NAME="182"></A>is not a finite but an infinite time, and the contact with the infinites 
<A NAME="183"></A>is made by means of moments not finite but infinite in 
<A NAME="184"></A>number.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>The passage over the infinite, then, cannot occupy a finite time, 
<A NAME="186"></A>and the passage over the finite cannot occupy an infinite time: if the 
<A NAME="187"></A>time is infinite the magnitude must be infinite also, and if the magnitude 
<A NAME="188"></A>is infinite, so also is the time. This may be shown as follows. Let AB 
<A NAME="189"></A>be a finite magnitude, and let us suppose that it is traversed in infinite 
<A NAME="190"></A>time G, and let a finite period GD of the time be taken. Now in this period 
<A NAME="191"></A>the thing in motion will pass over a certain segment of the magnitude: 
<A NAME="192"></A>let BE be the segment that it has thus passed over. (This will be either 
<A NAME="193"></A>an exact measure of AB or less or greater than an exact measure: it makes 
<A NAME="194"></A>no difference which it is.) Then, since a magnitude equal to BE will always 
<A NAME="195"></A>be passed over in an equal time, and BE measures the whole magnitude, the 
<A NAME="196"></A>whole time occupied in passing over AB will be finite: for it will be divisible 
<A NAME="197"></A>into periods equal in number to the segments into which the magnitude is 
<A NAME="198"></A>divisible. Moreover, if it is the case that infinite time is not occupied 
<A NAME="199"></A>in passing over every magnitude, but it is possible to ass over some magnitude, 
<A NAME="200"></A>say BE, in a finite time, and if this BE measures the whole of which it 
<A NAME="201"></A>is a part, and if an equal magnitude is passed over in an equal time, then 
<A NAME="202"></A>it follows that the time like the magnitude is finite. That infinite time 
<A NAME="203"></A>will not be occupied in passing over BE is evident if the time be taken 
<A NAME="204"></A>as limited in one direction: for as the part will be passed over in less 
<A NAME="205"></A>time than the whole, the time occupied in traversing this part must be 
<A NAME="206"></A>finite, the limit in one direction being given. The same reasoning will 
<A NAME="207"></A>also show the falsity of the assumption that infinite length can be traversed 
<A NAME="208"></A>in a finite time. It is evident, then, from what has been said that neither 
<A NAME="209"></A>a line nor a surface nor in fact anything continuous can be 
<A NAME="210"></A>indivisible.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>This conclusion follows not only from the present argument but 
<A NAME="212"></A>from the consideration that the opposite assumption implies the divisibility 
<A NAME="213"></A>of the indivisible. For since the distinction of quicker and slower may 
<A NAME="214"></A>apply to motions occupying any period of time and in an equal time the 
<A NAME="215"></A>quicker passes over a greater length, it may happen that it will pass over 
<A NAME="216"></A>a length twice, or one and a half times, as great as that passed over by 
<A NAME="217"></A>the slower: for their respective velocities may stand to one another in 
<A NAME="218"></A>this proportion. Suppose, then, that the quicker has in the same time been 
<A NAME="219"></A>carried over a length one and a half times as great as that traversed by 
<A NAME="220"></A>the slower, and that the respective magnitudes are divided, that of the 
<A NAME="221"></A>quicker, the magnitude ABGD, into three indivisibles, and that of the slower 
<A NAME="222"></A>into the two indivisibles EZ, ZH. Then the time may also be divided into 
<A NAME="223"></A>three indivisibles, for an equal magnitude will be passed over in an equal 
<A NAME="224"></A>time. Suppose then that it is thus divided into KL, Lm, MN. Again, since 
<A NAME="225"></A>in the same time the slower has been carried over Ez, ZH, the time may 
<A NAME="226"></A>also be similarly divided into two. Thus the indivisible will be divisible, 
<A NAME="227"></A>and that which has no parts will be passed over not in an indivisible but 
<A NAME="228"></A>in a greater time. It is evident, therefore, that nothing continuous is 
<A NAME="229"></A>without parts.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="230"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>The present also is necessarily indivisible-the present, that is, 
<A NAME="232"></A>not in the sense in which the word is applied to one thing in virtue of 
<A NAME="233"></A>another, but in its proper and primary sense; in which sense it is inherent 
<A NAME="234"></A>in all time. For the present is something that is an extremity of the past 
<A NAME="235"></A>(no part of the future being on this side of it) and also of the future 
<A NAME="236"></A>(no part of the past being on the other side of it): it is, as we have 
<A NAME="237"></A>said, a limit of both. And if it is once shown that it is essentially of 
<A NAME="238"></A>this character and one and the same, it will at once be evident also that 
<A NAME="239"></A>it is indivisible.
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>Now the present that is the extremity of both times must be one 
<A NAME="241"></A>and the same: for if each extremity were different, the one could not be 
<A NAME="242"></A>in succession to the other, because nothing continuous can be composed 
<A NAME="243"></A>of things having no parts: and if the one is apart from the other, there 
<A NAME="244"></A>will be time intermediate between them, because everything continuous is 
<A NAME="245"></A>such that there is something intermediate between its limits and described 
<A NAME="246"></A>by the same name as itself. But if the intermediate thing is time, it will 
<A NAME="247"></A>be divisible: for all time has been shown to be divisible. Thus on this 
<A NAME="248"></A>assumption the present is divisible. But if the present is divisible, there 
<A NAME="249"></A>will be part of the past in the future and part of the future in the past: 
<A NAME="250"></A>for past time will be marked off from future time at the actual point of 
<A NAME="251"></A>division. Also the present will be a present not in the proper sense but 
<A NAME="252"></A>in virtue of something else: for the division which yields it will not 
<A NAME="253"></A>be a division proper. Furthermore, there will be a part of the present 
<A NAME="254"></A>that is past and a part that is future, and it will not always be the same 
<A NAME="255"></A>part that is past or future: in fact one and the same present will not 
<A NAME="256"></A>be simultaneous: for the time may be divided at many points. If, therefore, 
<A NAME="257"></A>the present cannot possibly have these characteristics, it follows that 
<A NAME="258"></A>it must be the same present that belongs to each of the two times. But 
<A NAME="259"></A>if this is so it is evident that the present is also indivisible: for if 
<A NAME="260"></A>it is divisible it will be involved in the same implications as before. 
<A NAME="261"></A>It is clear, then, from what has been said that time contains something 
<A NAME="262"></A>indivisible, and this is what we call a present.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>We will now show that nothing can be in motion in a present. For 
<A NAME="264"></A>if this is possible, there can be both quicker and slower motion in the 
<A NAME="265"></A>present. Suppose then that in the present N the quicker has traversed the 
<A NAME="266"></A>distance AB. That being so, the slower will in the same present traverse 
<A NAME="267"></A>a distance less than AB, say AG. But since the slower will have occupied 
<A NAME="268"></A>the whole present in traversing AG, the quicker will occupy less than this 
<A NAME="269"></A>in traversing it. Thus we shall have a division of the present, whereas 
<A NAME="270"></A>we found it to be indivisible. It is impossible, therefore, for anything 
<A NAME="271"></A>to be in motion in a present.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>Nor can anything be at rest in a present: for, as we were saying, 
<A NAME="273"></A>only can be at rest which is naturally designed to be in motion but is 
<A NAME="274"></A>not in motion when, where, or as it would naturally be so: since, therefore, 
<A NAME="275"></A>nothing is naturally designed to be in motion in a present, it is clear 
<A NAME="276"></A>that nothing can be at rest in a present either.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, inasmuch as it is the same present that belongs to both 
<A NAME="278"></A>the times, and it is possible for a thing to be in motion throughout one 
<A NAME="279"></A>time and to be at rest throughout the other, and that which is in motion 
<A NAME="280"></A>or at rest for the whole of a time will be in motion or at rest as the 
<A NAME="281"></A>case may be in any part of it in which it is naturally designed to be in 
<A NAME="282"></A>motion or at rest: this being so, the assumption that there can be motion 
<A NAME="283"></A>or rest in a present will carry with it the implication that the same thing 
<A NAME="284"></A>can at the same time be at rest and in motion: for both the times have 
<A NAME="285"></A>the same extremity, viz. the present.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>Again, when we say that a thing is at rest, we imply that its condition 
<A NAME="287"></A>in whole and in part is at the time of speaking uniform with what it was 
<A NAME="288"></A>previously: but the present contains no 'previously': consequently, there 
<A NAME="289"></A>can be no rest in it.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>It follows then that the motion of that which is in motion and 
<A NAME="291"></A>the rest of that which is at rest must occupy time.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="292"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>Further, everything that changes must be divisible. For since every 
<A NAME="294"></A>change is from something to something, and when a thing is at the goal 
<A NAME="295"></A>of its change it is no longer changing, and when both it itself and all 
<A NAME="296"></A>its parts are at the starting-point of its change it is not changing (for 
<A NAME="297"></A>that which is in whole and in part in an unvarying condition is not in 
<A NAME="298"></A>a state of change); it follows, therefore, that part of that which is changing 
<A NAME="299"></A>must be at the starting-point and part at the goal: for as a whole it cannot 
<A NAME="300"></A>be in both or in neither. (Here by 'goal of change' I mean that which comes 
<A NAME="301"></A>first in the process of change: e.g. in a process of change from white 
<A NAME="302"></A>the goal in question will be grey, not black: for it is not necessary that 
<A NAME="303"></A>that that which is changing should be at either of the extremes.) It is 
<A NAME="304"></A>evident, therefore, that everything that changes must be 
<A NAME="305"></A>divisible.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>Now motion is divisible in two senses. In the first place it is 
<A NAME="307"></A>divisible in virtue of the time that it occupies. In the second place it 
<A NAME="308"></A>is divisible according to the motions of the several parts of that which 
<A NAME="309"></A>is in motion: e.g. if the whole AG is in motion, there will be a motion 
<A NAME="310"></A>of AB and a motion of BG. That being so, let DE be the motion of the part 
<A NAME="311"></A>AB and EZ the motion of the part BG. Then the whole Dz must be the motion 
<A NAME="312"></A>of AG: for DZ must constitute the motion of AG inasmuch as DE and EZ severally 
<A NAME="313"></A>constitute the motions of each of its parts. But the motion of a thing 
<A NAME="314"></A>can never be constituted by the motion of something else: consequently 
<A NAME="315"></A>the whole motion is the motion of the whole magnitude.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>Again, since every motion is a motion of something, and the whole 
<A NAME="317"></A>motion DZ is not the motion of either of the parts (for each of the parts 
<A NAME="318"></A>DE, EZ is the motion of one of the parts AB, BG) or of anything else (for, 
<A NAME="319"></A>the whole motion being the motion of a whole, the parts of the motion are 
<A NAME="320"></A>the motions of the parts of that whole: and the parts of DZ are the motions 
<A NAME="321"></A>of AB, BG and of nothing else: for, as we saw, a motion that is one cannot 
<A NAME="322"></A>be the motion of more things than one): since this is so, the whole motion 
<A NAME="323"></A>will be the motion of the magnitude ABG.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>Again, if there is a motion of the whole other than DZ, say the 
<A NAME="325"></A>the of each of the arts may be subtracted from it: and these motions will 
<A NAME="326"></A>be equal to DE, EZ respectively: for the motion of that which is one must 
<A NAME="327"></A>be one. So if the whole motion OI may be divided into the motions of the 
<A NAME="328"></A>parts, OI will be equal to DZ: if on the other hand there is any remainder, 
<A NAME="329"></A>say KI, this will be a motion of nothing: for it can be the motion neither 
<A NAME="330"></A>of the whole nor of the parts (as the motion of that which is one must 
<A NAME="331"></A>be one) nor of anything else: for a motion that is continuous must be the 
<A NAME="332"></A>motion of things that are continuous. And the same result follows if the 
<A NAME="333"></A>division of OI reveals a surplus on the side of the motions of the parts. 
<A NAME="334"></A>Consequently, if this is impossible, the whole motion must be the same 
<A NAME="335"></A>as and equal to DZ.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>This then is what is meant by the division of motion according 
<A NAME="337"></A>to the motions of the parts: and it must be applicable to everything that 
<A NAME="338"></A>is divisible into parts.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>Motion is also susceptible of another kind of division, that according 
<A NAME="340"></A>to time. For since all motion is in time and all time is divisible, and 
<A NAME="341"></A>in less time the motion is less, it follows that every motion must be divisible 
<A NAME="342"></A>according to time. And since everything that is in motion is in motion 
<A NAME="343"></A>in a certain sphere and for a certain time and has a motion belonging to 
<A NAME="344"></A>it, it follows that the time, the motion, the being-in-motion, the thing 
<A NAME="345"></A>that is in motion, and the sphere of the motion must all be susceptible 
<A NAME="346"></A>of the same divisions (though spheres of motion are not all divisible in 
<A NAME="347"></A>a like manner: thus quantity is essentially, quality accidentally divisible). 
<A NAME="348"></A>For suppose that A is the time occupied by the motion B. Then if all the 
<A NAME="349"></A>time has been occupied by the whole motion, it will take less of the motion 
<A NAME="350"></A>to occupy half the time, less again to occupy a further subdivision of 
<A NAME="351"></A>the time, and so on to infinity. Again, the time will be divisible similarly 
<A NAME="352"></A>to the motion: for if the whole motion occupies all the time half the motion 
<A NAME="353"></A>will occupy half the time, and less of the motion again will occupy less 
<A NAME="354"></A>of the time.
<A NAME="355"></A><BR><BR>In the same way the being-in-motion will also be divisible. For 
<A NAME="356"></A>let G be the whole being-in-motion. Then the being-in-motion that corresponds 
<A NAME="357"></A>to half the motion will be less than the whole being-in-motion, that which 
<A NAME="358"></A>corresponds to a quarter of the motion will be less again, and so on to 
<A NAME="359"></A>infinity. Moreover by setting out successively the being-in-motion corresponding 
<A NAME="360"></A>to each of the two motions DG (say) and GE, we may argue that the whole 
<A NAME="361"></A>being-in-motion will correspond to the whole motion (for if it were some 
<A NAME="362"></A>other being-in-motion that corresponded to the whole motion, there would 
<A NAME="363"></A>be more than one being-in motion corresponding to the same motion), the 
<A NAME="364"></A>argument being the same as that whereby we showed that the motion of a 
<A NAME="365"></A>thing is divisible into the motions of the parts of the thing: for if we 
<A NAME="366"></A>take separately the being-in motion corresponding to each of the two motions, 
<A NAME="367"></A>we shall see that the whole being-in motion is continuous.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>The same reasoning will show the divisibility of the length, and 
<A NAME="369"></A>in fact of everything that forms a sphere of change (though some of these 
<A NAME="370"></A>are only accidentally divisible because that which changes is so): for 
<A NAME="371"></A>the division of one term will involve the division of all. So, too, in 
<A NAME="372"></A>the matter of their being finite or infinite, they will all alike be either 
<A NAME="373"></A>the one or the other. And we now see that in most cases the fact that all 
<A NAME="374"></A>the terms are divisible or infinite is a direct consequence of the fact 
<A NAME="375"></A>that the thing that changes is divisible or infinite: for the attributes 
<A NAME="376"></A>'divisible' and 'infinite' belong in the first instance to the thing that 
<A NAME="377"></A>changes. That divisibility does so we have already shown: that infinity 
<A NAME="378"></A>does so will be made clear in what follows?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="379"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>Since everything that changes changes from something to something, 
<A NAME="381"></A>that which has changed must at the moment when it has first changed be 
<A NAME="382"></A>in that to which it has changed. For that which changes retires from or 
<A NAME="383"></A>leaves that from which it changes: and leaving, if not identical with changing, 
<A NAME="384"></A>is at any rate a consequence of it. And if leaving is a consequence of 
<A NAME="385"></A>changing, having left is a consequence of having changed: for there is 
<A NAME="386"></A>a like relation between the two in each case.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>One kind of change, then, being change in a relation of contradiction, 
<A NAME="388"></A>where a thing has changed from not-being to being it has left not-being. 
<A NAME="389"></A>Therefore it will be in being: for everything must either be or not be. 
<A NAME="390"></A>It is evident, then, that in contradictory change that which has changed 
<A NAME="391"></A>must be in that to which it has changed. And if this is true in this kind 
<A NAME="392"></A>of change, it will be true in all other kinds as well: for in this matter 
<A NAME="393"></A>what holds good in the case of one will hold good likewise in the case 
<A NAME="394"></A>of the rest.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, if we take each kind of change separately, the truth 
<A NAME="396"></A>of our conclusion will be equally evident, on the ground that that that 
<A NAME="397"></A>which has changed must be somewhere or in something. For, since it has 
<A NAME="398"></A>left that from which it has changed and must be somewhere, it must be either 
<A NAME="399"></A>in that to which it has changed or in something else. If, then, that which 
<A NAME="400"></A>has changed to B is in something other than B, say G, it must again be 
<A NAME="401"></A>changing from G to B: for it cannot be assumed that there is no interval 
<A NAME="402"></A>between G and B, since change is continuous. Thus we have the result that 
<A NAME="403"></A>the thing that has changed, at the moment when it has changed, is changing 
<A NAME="404"></A>to that to which it has changed, which is impossible: that which has changed, 
<A NAME="405"></A>therefore, must be in that to which it has changed. So it is evident likewise 
<A NAME="406"></A>that that that which has come to be, at the moment when it has come to 
<A NAME="407"></A>be, will be, and that which has ceased to be will not-be: for what we have 
<A NAME="408"></A>said applies universally to every kind of change, and its truth is most 
<A NAME="409"></A>obvious in the case of contradictory change. It is clear, then, that that 
<A NAME="410"></A>which has changed, at the moment when it has first changed, is in that 
<A NAME="411"></A>to which it has changed.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>We will now show that the 'primary when' in which that which has 
<A NAME="413"></A>changed effected the completion of its change must be indivisible, where 
<A NAME="414"></A>by 'primary' I mean possessing the characteristics in question of itself 
<A NAME="415"></A>and not in virtue of the possession of them by something else belonging 
<A NAME="416"></A>to it. For let AG be divisible, and let it be divided at B. If then the 
<A NAME="417"></A>completion of change has been effected in AB or again in BG, AG cannot 
<A NAME="418"></A>be the primary thing in which the completion of change has been effected. 
<A NAME="419"></A>If, on the other hand, it has been changing in both AB and BG (for it must 
<A NAME="420"></A>either have changed or be changing in each of them), it must have been 
<A NAME="421"></A>changing in the whole AG: but our assumption was that AG contains only 
<A NAME="422"></A>the completion of the change. It is equally impossible to suppose that 
<A NAME="423"></A>one part of AG contains the process and the other the completion of the 
<A NAME="424"></A>change: for then we shall have something prior to what is primary. So that 
<A NAME="425"></A>in which the completion of change has been effected must be indivisible. 
<A NAME="426"></A>It is also evident, therefore, that that that in which that which has ceased 
<A NAME="427"></A>to be has ceased to be and that in which that which has come to be has 
<A NAME="428"></A>come to be are indivisible.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>But there are two senses of the expression 'the primary when in 
<A NAME="430"></A>which something has changed'. On the one hand it may mean the primary when 
<A NAME="431"></A>containing the completion of the process of change- the moment when it 
<A NAME="432"></A>is correct to say 'it has changed': on the other hand it may mean the primary 
<A NAME="433"></A>when containing the beginning of the process of change. Now the primary 
<A NAME="434"></A>when that has reference to the end of the change is something really existent: 
<A NAME="435"></A>for a change may really be completed, and there is such a thing as an end 
<A NAME="436"></A>of change, which we have in fact shown to be indivisible because it is 
<A NAME="437"></A>a limit. But that which has reference to the beginning is not existent 
<A NAME="438"></A>at all: for there is no such thing as a beginning of a process of change, 
<A NAME="439"></A>and the time occupied by the change does not contain any primary when in 
<A NAME="440"></A>which the change began. For suppose that AD is such a primary when. Then 
<A NAME="441"></A>it cannot be indivisible: for, if it were, the moment immediately preceding 
<A NAME="442"></A>the change and the moment in which the change begins would be consecutive 
<A NAME="443"></A>(and moments cannot be consecutive). Again, if the changing thing is at 
<A NAME="444"></A>rest in the whole preceding time GA (for we may suppose that it is at rest), 
<A NAME="445"></A>it is at rest in A also: so if AD is without parts, it will simultaneously 
<A NAME="446"></A>be at rest and have changed: for it is at rest in A and has changed in 
<A NAME="447"></A>D. Since then AD is not without parts, it must be divisible, and the changing 
<A NAME="448"></A>thing must have changed in every part of it (for if it has changed in neither 
<A NAME="449"></A>of the two parts into which AD is divided, it has not changed in the whole 
<A NAME="450"></A>either: if, on the other hand, it is in process of change in both parts, 
<A NAME="451"></A>it is likewise in process of change in the whole: and if, again, it has 
<A NAME="452"></A>changed in one of the two parts, the whole is not the primary when in which 
<A NAME="453"></A>it has changed: it must therefore have changed in every part). It is evident, 
<A NAME="454"></A>then, that with reference to the beginning of change there is no primary 
<A NAME="455"></A>when in which change has been effected: for the divisions are 
<A NAME="456"></A>infinite.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>So, too, of that which has changed there is no primary part that 
<A NAME="458"></A>has changed. For suppose that of AE the primary part that has changed is 
<A NAME="459"></A>Az (everything that changes having been shown to be divisible): and let 
<A NAME="460"></A>OI be the time in which DZ has changed. If, then, in the whole time DZ 
<A NAME="461"></A>has changed, in half the time there will be a part that has changed, less 
<A NAME="462"></A>than and therefore prior to DZ: and again there will be another part prior 
<A NAME="463"></A>to this, and yet another, and so on to infinity. Thus of that which changes 
<A NAME="464"></A>there cannot be any primary part that has changed. It is evident, then, 
<A NAME="465"></A>from what has been said, that neither of that which changes nor of the 
<A NAME="466"></A>time in which it changes is there any primary part.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>With regard, however, to the actual subject of change-that is to 
<A NAME="468"></A>say that in respect of which a thing changes-there is a difference to be 
<A NAME="469"></A>observed. For in a process of change we may distinguish three terms-that 
<A NAME="470"></A>which changes, that in which it changes, and the actual subject of change, 
<A NAME="471"></A>e.g. the man, the time, and the fair complexion. Of these the man and the 
<A NAME="472"></A>time are divisible: but with the fair complexion it is otherwise (though 
<A NAME="473"></A>they are all divisible accidentally, for that in which the fair complexion 
<A NAME="474"></A>or any other quality is an accident is divisible). For of actual subjects 
<A NAME="475"></A>of change it will be seen that those which are classed as essentially, 
<A NAME="476"></A>not accidentally, divisible have no primary part. Take the case of magnitudes: 
<A NAME="477"></A>let AB be a magnitude, and suppose that it has moved from B to a primary 
<A NAME="478"></A>'where' G. Then if BG is taken to be indivisible, two things without parts 
<A NAME="479"></A>will have to be contiguous (which is impossible): if on the other hand 
<A NAME="480"></A>it is taken to be divisible, there will be something prior to G to which 
<A NAME="481"></A>the magnitude has changed, and something else again prior to that, and 
<A NAME="482"></A>so on to infinity, because the process of division may be continued without 
<A NAME="483"></A>end. Thus there can be no primary 'where' to which a thing has changed. 
<A NAME="484"></A>And if we take the case of quantitative change, we shall get a like result, 
<A NAME="485"></A>for here too the change is in something continuous. It is evident, then, 
<A NAME="486"></A>that only in qualitative motion can there be anything essentially 
<A NAME="487"></A>indivisible.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="488"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR>Now everything that changes changes time, and that in two senses: 
<A NAME="490"></A>for the time in which a thing is said to change may be the primary time, 
<A NAME="491"></A>or on the other hand it may have an extended reference, as e.g. when we 
<A NAME="492"></A>say that a thing changes in a particular year because it changes in a particular 
<A NAME="493"></A>day. That being so, that which changes must be changing in any part of 
<A NAME="494"></A>the primary time in which it changes. This is clear from our definition 
<A NAME="495"></A>of 'primary', in which the word is said to express just this: it may also, 
<A NAME="496"></A>however, be made evident by the following argument. Let ChRh be the primary 
<A NAME="497"></A>time in which that which is in motion is in motion: and (as all time is 
<A NAME="498"></A>divisible) let it be divided at K. Now in the time ChK it either is in 
<A NAME="499"></A>motion or is not in motion, and the same is likewise true of the time KRh. 
<A NAME="500"></A>Then if it is in motion in neither of the two parts, it will be at rest 
<A NAME="501"></A>in the whole: for it is impossible that it should be in motion in a time 
<A NAME="502"></A>in no part of which it is in motion. If on the other hand it is in motion 
<A NAME="503"></A>in only one of the two parts of the time, ChRh cannot be the primary time 
<A NAME="504"></A>in which it is in motion: for its motion will have reference to a time 
<A NAME="505"></A>other than ChRh. It must, then, have been in motion in any part of 
<A NAME="506"></A>ChRh.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>And now that this has been proved, it is evident that everything 
<A NAME="508"></A>that is in motion must have been in motion before. For if that which is 
<A NAME="509"></A>in motion has traversed the distance KL in the primary time ChRh, in half 
<A NAME="510"></A>the time a thing that is in motion with equal velocity and began its motion 
<A NAME="511"></A>at the same time will have traversed half the distance. But if this second 
<A NAME="512"></A>thing whose velocity is equal has traversed a certain distance in a certain 
<A NAME="513"></A>time, the original thing that is in motion must have traversed the same 
<A NAME="514"></A>distance in the same time. Hence that which is in motion must have been 
<A NAME="515"></A>in motion before.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>Again, if by taking the extreme moment of the time-for it is the 
<A NAME="517"></A>moment that defines the time, and time is that which is intermediate between 
<A NAME="518"></A>moments-we are enabled to say that motion has taken place in the whole 
<A NAME="519"></A>time ChRh or in fact in any period of it, motion may likewise be said to 
<A NAME="520"></A>have taken place in every other such period. But half the time finds an 
<A NAME="521"></A>extreme in the point of division. Therefore motion will have taken place 
<A NAME="522"></A>in half the time and in fact in any part of it: for as soon as any division 
<A NAME="523"></A>is made there is always a time defined by moments. If, then, all time is 
<A NAME="524"></A>divisible, and that which is intermediate between moments is time, everything 
<A NAME="525"></A>that is changing must have completed an infinite number of 
<A NAME="526"></A>changes.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>Again, since a thing that changes continuously and has not perished 
<A NAME="528"></A>or ceased from its change must either be changing or have changed in any 
<A NAME="529"></A>part of the time of its change, and since it cannot be changing in a moment, 
<A NAME="530"></A>it follows that it must have changed at every moment in the time: consequently, 
<A NAME="531"></A>since the moments are infinite in number, everything that is changing must 
<A NAME="532"></A>have completed an infinite number of changes.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>And not only must that which is changing have changed, but that 
<A NAME="534"></A>which has changed must also previously have been changing, since everything 
<A NAME="535"></A>that has changed from something to something has changed in a period of 
<A NAME="536"></A>time. For suppose that a thing has changed from A to B in a moment. Now 
<A NAME="537"></A>the moment in which it has changed cannot be the same as that in which 
<A NAME="538"></A>it is at A (since in that case it would be in A and B at once): for we 
<A NAME="539"></A>have shown above that that that which has changed, when it has changed, 
<A NAME="540"></A>is not in that from which it has changed. If, on the other hand, it is 
<A NAME="541"></A>a different moment, there will be a period of time intermediate between 
<A NAME="542"></A>the two: for, as we saw, moments are not consecutive. Since, then, it has 
<A NAME="543"></A>changed in a period of time, and all time is divisible, in half the time 
<A NAME="544"></A>it will have completed another change, in a quarter another, and so on 
<A NAME="545"></A>to infinity: consequently when it has changed, it must have previously 
<A NAME="546"></A>been changing.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, the truth of what has been said is more evident in the 
<A NAME="548"></A>case of magnitude, because the magnitude over which what is changing changes 
<A NAME="549"></A>is continuous. For suppose that a thing has changed from G to D. Then if 
<A NAME="550"></A>GD is indivisible, two things without parts will be consecutive. But since 
<A NAME="551"></A>this is impossible, that which is intermediate between them must be a magnitude 
<A NAME="552"></A>and divisible into an infinite number of segments: consequently, before 
<A NAME="553"></A>the change is completed, the thing changes to those segments. Everything 
<A NAME="554"></A>that has changed, therefore, must previously have been changing: for the 
<A NAME="555"></A>same proof also holds good of change with respect to what is not continuous, 
<A NAME="556"></A>changes, that is to say, between contraries and between contradictories. 
<A NAME="557"></A>In such cases we have only to take the time in which a thing has changed 
<A NAME="558"></A>and again apply the same reasoning. So that which has changed must have 
<A NAME="559"></A>been changing and that which is changing must have changed, and a process 
<A NAME="560"></A>of change is preceded by a completion of change and a completion by a process: 
<A NAME="561"></A>and we can never take any stage and say that it is absolutely the first. 
<A NAME="562"></A>The reason of this is that no two things without parts can be contiguous, 
<A NAME="563"></A>and therefore in change the process of division is infinite, just as lines 
<A NAME="564"></A>may be infinitely divided so that one part is continually increasing and 
<A NAME="565"></A>the other continually decreasing.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>So it is evident also that that that which has become must previously 
<A NAME="567"></A>have been in process of becoming, and that which is in process of becoming 
<A NAME="568"></A>must previously have become, everything (that is) that is divisible and 
<A NAME="569"></A>continuous: though it is not always the actual thing that is in process 
<A NAME="570"></A>of becoming of which this is true: sometimes it is something else, that 
<A NAME="571"></A>is to say, some part of the thing in question, e.g. the foundation-stone 
<A NAME="572"></A>of a house. So, too, in the case of that which is perishing and that which 
<A NAME="573"></A>has perished: for that which becomes and that which perishes must contain 
<A NAME="574"></A>an element of infiniteness as an immediate consequence of the fact that 
<A NAME="575"></A>they are continuous things: and so a thing cannot be in process of becoming 
<A NAME="576"></A>without having become or have become without having been in process of 
<A NAME="577"></A>becoming. So, too, in the case of perishing and having perished: perishing 
<A NAME="578"></A>must be preceded by having perished, and having perished must be preceded 
<A NAME="579"></A>by perishing. It is evident, then, that that which has become must previously 
<A NAME="580"></A>have been in process of becoming, and that which is in process of becoming 
<A NAME="581"></A>must previously have become: for all magnitudes and all periods of time 
<A NAME="582"></A>are infinitely divisible.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR>Consequently no absolutely first stage of change can be represented 
<A NAME="584"></A>by any particular part of space or time which the changing thing may 
<A NAME="585"></A>occupy.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="586"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR>Now since the motion of everything that is in motion occupies a 
<A NAME="588"></A>period of time, and a greater magnitude is traversed in a longer time, 
<A NAME="589"></A>it is impossible that a thing should undergo a finite motion in an infinite 
<A NAME="590"></A>time, if this is understood to mean not that the same motion or a part 
<A NAME="591"></A>of it is continually repeated, but that the whole infinite time is occupied 
<A NAME="592"></A>by the whole finite motion. In all cases where a thing is in motion with 
<A NAME="593"></A>uniform velocity it is clear that the finite magnitude is traversed in 
<A NAME="594"></A>a finite time. For if we take a part of the motion which shall be a measure 
<A NAME="595"></A>of the whole, the whole motion is completed in as many equal periods of 
<A NAME="596"></A>the time as there are parts of the motion. Consequently, since these parts 
<A NAME="597"></A>are finite, both in size individually and in number collectively, the whole 
<A NAME="598"></A>time must also be finite: for it will be a multiple of the portion, equal 
<A NAME="599"></A>to the time occupied in completing the aforesaid part multiplied by the 
<A NAME="600"></A>number of the parts.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>But it makes no difference even if the velocity is not uniform. 
<A NAME="602"></A>For let us suppose that the line AB represents a finite stretch over which 
<A NAME="603"></A>a thing has been moved in the given time, and let GD be the infinite time. 
<A NAME="604"></A>Now if one part of the stretch must have been traversed before another 
<A NAME="605"></A>part (this is clear, that in the earlier and in the later part of the time 
<A NAME="606"></A>a different part of the stretch has been traversed: for as the time lengthens 
<A NAME="607"></A>a different part of the motion will always be completed in it, whether 
<A NAME="608"></A>the thing in motion changes with uniform velocity or not: and whether the 
<A NAME="609"></A>rate of motion increases or diminishes or remains stationary this is none 
<A NAME="610"></A>the less so), let us then take AE a part of the whole stretch of motion 
<A NAME="611"></A>AB which shall be a measure of AB. Now this part of the motion occupies 
<A NAME="612"></A>a certain period of the infinite time: it cannot itself occupy an infinite 
<A NAME="613"></A>time, for we are assuming that that is occupied by the whole AB. And if 
<A NAME="614"></A>again I take another part equal to AE, that also must occupy a finite time 
<A NAME="615"></A>in consequence of the same assumption. And if I go on taking parts in this 
<A NAME="616"></A>way, on the one hand there is no part which will be a measure of the infinite 
<A NAME="617"></A>time (for the infinite cannot be composed of finite parts whether equal 
<A NAME="618"></A>or unequal, because there must be some unity which will be a measure of 
<A NAME="619"></A>things finite in multitude or in magnitude, which, whether they are equal 
<A NAME="620"></A>or unequal, are none the less limited in magnitude); while on the other 
<A NAME="621"></A>hand the finite stretch of motion AB is a certain multiple of AE: consequently 
<A NAME="622"></A>the motion AB must be accomplished in a finite time. Moreover it is the 
<A NAME="623"></A>same with coming to rest as with motion. And so it is impossible for one 
<A NAME="624"></A>and the same thing to be infinitely in process of becoming or of perishing. 
<A NAME="625"></A>The reasoning he will prove that in a finite time there cannot be an infinite 
<A NAME="626"></A>extent of motion or of coming to rest, whether the motion is regular or 
<A NAME="627"></A>irregular. For if we take a part which shall be a measure of the whole 
<A NAME="628"></A>time, in this part a certain fraction, not the whole, of the magnitude 
<A NAME="629"></A>will be traversed, because we assume that the traversing of the whole occupies 
<A NAME="630"></A>all the time. Again, in another equal part of the time another part of 
<A NAME="631"></A>the magnitude will be traversed: and similarly in each part of the time 
<A NAME="632"></A>that we take, whether equal or unequal to the part originally taken. It 
<A NAME="633"></A>makes no difference whether the parts are equal or not, if only each is 
<A NAME="634"></A>finite: for it is clear that while the time is exhausted by the subtraction 
<A NAME="635"></A>of its parts, the infinite magnitude will not be thus exhausted, since 
<A NAME="636"></A>the process of subtraction is finite both in respect of the quantity subtracted 
<A NAME="637"></A>and of the number of times a subtraction is made. Consequently the infinite 
<A NAME="638"></A>magnitude will not be traversed in finite time: and it makes no difference 
<A NAME="639"></A>whether the magnitude is infinite in only one direction or in both: for 
<A NAME="640"></A>the same reasoning will hold good.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>This having been proved, it is evident that neither can a finite 
<A NAME="642"></A>magnitude traverse an infinite magnitude in a finite time, the reason being 
<A NAME="643"></A>the same as that given above: in part of the time it will traverse a finite 
<A NAME="644"></A>magnitude and in each several part likewise, so that in the whole time 
<A NAME="645"></A>it will traverse a finite magnitude.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>And since a finite magnitude will not traverse an infinite in a 
<A NAME="647"></A>finite time, it is clear that neither will an infinite traverse a finite 
<A NAME="648"></A>in a finite time. For if the infinite could traverse the finite, the finite 
<A NAME="649"></A>could traverse the infinite; for it makes no difference which of the two 
<A NAME="650"></A>is the thing in motion; either case involves the traversing of the infinite 
<A NAME="651"></A>by the finite. For when the infinite magnitude A is in motion a part of 
<A NAME="652"></A>it, say GD, will occupy the finite and then another, and then another, 
<A NAME="653"></A>and so on to infinity. Thus the two results will coincide: the infinite 
<A NAME="654"></A>will have completed a motion over the finite and the finite will have traversed 
<A NAME="655"></A>the infinite: for it would seem to be impossible for the motion of the 
<A NAME="656"></A>infinite over the finite to occur in any way other than by the finite traversing 
<A NAME="657"></A>the infinite either by locomotion over it or by measuring it. Therefore, 
<A NAME="658"></A>since this is impossible, the infinite cannot traverse the 
<A NAME="659"></A>finite.
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR>Nor again will the infinite traverse the infinite in a finite time. 
<A NAME="661"></A>Otherwise it would also traverse the finite, for the infinite includes 
<A NAME="662"></A>the finite. We can further prove this in the same way by taking the time 
<A NAME="663"></A>as our starting-point.
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>Since, then, it is established that in a finite time neither will 
<A NAME="665"></A>the finite traverse the infinite, nor the infinite the finite, nor the 
<A NAME="666"></A>infinite the infinite, it is evident also that in a finite time there cannot 
<A NAME="667"></A>be infinite motion: for what difference does it make whether we take the 
<A NAME="668"></A>motion or the magnitude to be infinite? If either of the two is infinite, 
<A NAME="669"></A>the other must be so likewise: for all locomotion is in 
<A NAME="670"></A>space.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="671"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>Since everything to which motion or rest is natural is in motion 
<A NAME="673"></A>or at rest in the natural time, place, and manner, that which is coming 
<A NAME="674"></A>to a stand, when it is coming to a stand, must be in motion: for if it 
<A NAME="675"></A>is not in motion it must be at rest: but that which is at rest cannot be 
<A NAME="676"></A>coming to rest. From this it evidently follows that coming to a stand must 
<A NAME="677"></A>occupy a period of time: for the motion of that which is in motion occupies 
<A NAME="678"></A>a period of time, and that which is coming to a stand has been shown to 
<A NAME="679"></A>be in motion: consequently coming to a stand must occupy a period of 
<A NAME="680"></A>time.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>Again, since the terms 'quicker' and 'slower' are used only of 
<A NAME="682"></A>that which occupies a period of time, and the process of coming to a stand 
<A NAME="683"></A>may be quicker or slower, the same conclusion follows.
<A NAME="684"></A><BR><BR>And that which is coming to a stand must be coming to a stand in 
<A NAME="685"></A>any part of the primary time in which it is coming to a stand. For if it 
<A NAME="686"></A>is coming to a stand in neither of two parts into which the time may be 
<A NAME="687"></A>divided, it cannot be coming to a stand in the whole time, with the result 
<A NAME="688"></A>that that that which is coming to a stand will not be coming to a stand. 
<A NAME="689"></A>If on the other hand it is coming to a stand in only one of the two parts 
<A NAME="690"></A>of the time, the whole cannot be the primary time in which it is coming 
<A NAME="691"></A>to a stand: for it is coming to a stand in the whole time not primarily 
<A NAME="692"></A>but in virtue of something distinct from itself, the argument being the 
<A NAME="693"></A>same as that which we used above about things in motion.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>And just as there is no primary time in which that which is in 
<A NAME="695"></A>motion is in motion, so too there is no primary time in which that which 
<A NAME="696"></A>is coming to a stand is coming to a stand, there being no primary stage 
<A NAME="697"></A>either of being in motion or of coming to a stand. For let AB be the primary 
<A NAME="698"></A>time in which a thing is coming to a stand. Now AB cannot be without parts: 
<A NAME="699"></A>for there cannot be motion in that which is without parts, because the 
<A NAME="700"></A>moving thing would necessarily have been already moved for part of the 
<A NAME="701"></A>time of its movement: and that which is coming to a stand has been shown 
<A NAME="702"></A>to be in motion. But since Ab is therefore divisible, the thing is coming 
<A NAME="703"></A>to a stand in every one of the parts of AB: for we have shown above that 
<A NAME="704"></A>it is coming to a stand in every one of the parts in which it is primarily 
<A NAME="705"></A>coming to a stand. Since then, that in which primarily a thing is coming 
<A NAME="706"></A>to a stand must be a period of time and not something indivisible, and 
<A NAME="707"></A>since all time is infinitely divisible, there cannot be anything in which 
<A NAME="708"></A>primarily it is coming to a stand.
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR>Nor again can there be a primary time at which the being at rest 
<A NAME="710"></A>of that which is at rest occurred: for it cannot have occurred in that 
<A NAME="711"></A>which has no parts, because there cannot be motion in that which is indivisible, 
<A NAME="712"></A>and that in which rest takes place is the same as that in which motion 
<A NAME="713"></A>takes place: for we defined a state of rest to be the state of a thing 
<A NAME="714"></A>to which motion is natural but which is not in motion when (that is to 
<A NAME="715"></A>say in that in which) motion would be natural to it. Again, our use of 
<A NAME="716"></A>the phrase 'being at rest' also implies that the previous state of a thing 
<A NAME="717"></A>is still unaltered, not one point only but two at least being thus needed 
<A NAME="718"></A>to determine its presence: consequently that in which a thing is at rest 
<A NAME="719"></A>cannot be without parts. Since, then it is divisible, it must be a period 
<A NAME="720"></A>of time, and the thing must be at rest in every one of its parts, as may 
<A NAME="721"></A>be shown by the same method as that used above in similar 
<A NAME="722"></A>demonstrations.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>So there can be no primary part of the time: and the reason is 
<A NAME="724"></A>that rest and motion are always in a period of time, and a period of time 
<A NAME="725"></A>has no primary part any more than a magnitude or in fact anything continuous: 
<A NAME="726"></A>for everything continuous is divisible into an infinite number of 
<A NAME="727"></A>parts.
<A NAME="728"></A><BR><BR>And since everything that is in motion is in motion in a period 
<A NAME="729"></A>of time and changes from something to something, when its motion is comprised 
<A NAME="730"></A>within a particular period of time essentially-that is to say when it fills 
<A NAME="731"></A>the whole and not merely a part of the time in question-it is impossible 
<A NAME="732"></A>that in that time that which is in motion should be over against some particular 
<A NAME="733"></A>thing primarily. For if a thing-itself and each of its parts-occupies the 
<A NAME="734"></A>same space for a definite period of time, it is at rest: for it is in just 
<A NAME="735"></A>these circumstances that we use the term 'being at rest'-when at one moment 
<A NAME="736"></A>after another it can be said with truth that a thing, itself and its parts, 
<A NAME="737"></A>occupies the same space. So if this is being at rest it is impossible for 
<A NAME="738"></A>that which is changing to be as a whole, at the time when it is primarily 
<A NAME="739"></A>changing, over against any particular thing (for the whole period of time 
<A NAME="740"></A>is divisible), so that in one part of it after another it will be true 
<A NAME="741"></A>to say that the thing, itself and its parts, occupies the same space. If 
<A NAME="742"></A>this is not so and the aforesaid proposition is true only at a single moment, 
<A NAME="743"></A>then the thing will be over against a particular thing not for any period 
<A NAME="744"></A>of time but only at a moment that limits the time. It is true that at any 
<A NAME="745"></A>moment it is always over against something stationary: but it is not at 
<A NAME="746"></A>rest: for at a moment it is not possible for anything to be either in motion 
<A NAME="747"></A>or at rest. So while it is true to say that that which is in motion is 
<A NAME="748"></A>at a moment not in motion and is opposite some particular thing, it cannot 
<A NAME="749"></A>in a period of time be over against that which is at rest: for that would 
<A NAME="750"></A>involve the conclusion that that which is in locomotion is at 
<A NAME="751"></A>rest.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="752"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="753"></A><BR><BR>Zeno's reasoning, however, is fallacious, when he says that if 
<A NAME="754"></A>everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that which 
<A NAME="755"></A>is in locomotion is always occupying such a space at any moment, the flying 
<A NAME="756"></A>arrow is therefore motionless. This is false, for time is not composed 
<A NAME="757"></A>of indivisible moments any more than any other magnitude is composed of 
<A NAME="758"></A>indivisibles.
<A NAME="759"></A><BR><BR>Zeno's arguments about motion, which cause so much disquietude 
<A NAME="760"></A>to those who try to solve the problems that they present, are four in number. 
<A NAME="761"></A>The first asserts the non-existence of motion on the ground that that which 
<A NAME="762"></A>is in locomotion must arrive at the half-way stage before it arrives at 
<A NAME="763"></A>the goal. This we have discussed above.
<A NAME="764"></A><BR><BR>The second is the so-called 'Achilles', and it amounts to this, 
<A NAME="765"></A>that in a race the quickest runner can never overtake the slowest, since 
<A NAME="766"></A>the pursuer must first reach the point whence the pursued started, so that 
<A NAME="767"></A>the slower must always hold a lead. This argument is the same in principle 
<A NAME="768"></A>as that which depends on bisection, though it differs from it in that the 
<A NAME="769"></A>spaces with which we successively have to deal are not divided into halves. 
<A NAME="770"></A>The result of the argument is that the slower is not overtaken: but it 
<A NAME="771"></A>proceeds along the same lines as the bisection-argument (for in both a 
<A NAME="772"></A>division of the space in a certain way leads to the result that the goal 
<A NAME="773"></A>is not reached, though the 'Achilles' goes further in that it affirms that 
<A NAME="774"></A>even the quickest runner in legendary tradition must fail in his pursuit 
<A NAME="775"></A>of the slowest), so that the solution must be the same. And the axiom that 
<A NAME="776"></A>that which holds a lead is never overtaken is false: it is not overtaken, 
<A NAME="777"></A>it is true, while it holds a lead: but it is overtaken nevertheless if 
<A NAME="778"></A>it is granted that it traverses the finite distance prescribed. These then 
<A NAME="779"></A>are two of his arguments.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR><BR>The third is that already given above, to the effect that the flying 
<A NAME="781"></A>arrow is at rest, which result follows from the assumption that time is 
<A NAME="782"></A>composed of moments: if this assumption is not granted, the conclusion 
<A NAME="783"></A>will not follow.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR><BR>The fourth argument is that concerning the two rows of bodies, 
<A NAME="785"></A>each row being composed of an equal number of bodies of equal size, passing 
<A NAME="786"></A>each other on a race-course as they proceed with equal velocity in opposite 
<A NAME="787"></A>directions, the one row originally occupying the space between the goal 
<A NAME="788"></A>and the middle point of the course and the other that between the middle 
<A NAME="789"></A>point and the starting-post. This, he thinks, involves the conclusion that 
<A NAME="790"></A>half a given time is equal to double that time. The fallacy of the reasoning 
<A NAME="791"></A>lies in the assumption that a body occupies an equal time in passing with 
<A NAME="792"></A>equal velocity a body that is in motion and a body of equal size that is 
<A NAME="793"></A>at rest; which is false. For instance (so runs the argument), let A, A...be 
<A NAME="794"></A>the stationary bodies of equal size, B, B...the bodies, equal in number 
<A NAME="795"></A>and in size to A, A...,originally occupying the half of the course from 
<A NAME="796"></A>the starting-post to the middle of the A's, and G, G...those originally 
<A NAME="797"></A>occupying the other half from the goal to the middle of the A's, equal 
<A NAME="798"></A>in number, size, and velocity to B, B....Then three consequences 
<A NAME="799"></A>follow:
<A NAME="800"></A><BR><BR>First, as the B's and the G's pass one another, the first B reaches 
<A NAME="801"></A>the last G at the same moment as the first G reaches the last B. Secondly 
<A NAME="802"></A>at this moment the first G has passed all the A's, whereas the first B 
<A NAME="803"></A>has passed only half the A's, and has consequently occupied only half the 
<A NAME="804"></A>time occupied by the first G, since each of the two occupies an equal time 
<A NAME="805"></A>in passing each A. Thirdly, at the same moment all the B's have passed 
<A NAME="806"></A>all the G's: for the first G and the first B will simultaneously reach 
<A NAME="807"></A>the opposite ends of the course, since (so says Zeno) the time occupied 
<A NAME="808"></A>by the first G in passing each of the B's is equal to that occupied by 
<A NAME="809"></A>it in passing each of the A's, because an equal time is occupied by both 
<A NAME="810"></A>the first B and the first G in passing all the A's. This is the argument, 
<A NAME="811"></A>but it presupposed the aforesaid fallacious assumption.
<A NAME="812"></A><BR><BR>Nor in reference to contradictory change shall we find anything 
<A NAME="813"></A>unanswerable in the argument that if a thing is changing from not-white, 
<A NAME="814"></A>say, to white, and is in neither condition, then it will be neither white 
<A NAME="815"></A>nor not-white: for the fact that it is not wholly in either condition will 
<A NAME="816"></A>not preclude us from calling it white or not-white. We call a thing white 
<A NAME="817"></A>or not-white not necessarily because it is be one or the other, but cause 
<A NAME="818"></A>most of its parts or the most essential parts of it are so: not being in 
<A NAME="819"></A>a certain condition is different from not being wholly in that condition. 
<A NAME="820"></A>So, too, in the case of being and not-being and all other conditions which 
<A NAME="821"></A>stand in a contradictory relation: while the changing thing must of necessity 
<A NAME="822"></A>be in one of the two opposites, it is never wholly in 
<A NAME="823"></A>either.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR><BR>Again, in the case of circles and spheres and everything whose 
<A NAME="825"></A>motion is confined within the space that it occupies, it is not true to 
<A NAME="826"></A>say the motion can be nothing but rest, on the ground that such things 
<A NAME="827"></A>in motion, themselves and their parts, will occupy the same position for 
<A NAME="828"></A>a period of time, and that therefore they will be at once at rest and in 
<A NAME="829"></A>motion. For in the first place the parts do not occupy the same position 
<A NAME="830"></A>for any period of time: and in the second place the whole also is always 
<A NAME="831"></A>changing to a different position: for if we take the orbit as described 
<A NAME="832"></A>from a point A on a circumference, it will not be the same as the orbit 
<A NAME="833"></A>as described from B or G or any other point on the same circumference except 
<A NAME="834"></A>in an accidental sense, the sense that is to say in which a musical man 
<A NAME="835"></A>is the same as a man. Thus one orbit is always changing into another, and 
<A NAME="836"></A>the thing will never be at rest. And it is the same with the sphere and 
<A NAME="837"></A>everything else whose motion is confined within the space that it 
<A NAME="838"></A>occupies.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="839"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR>Our next point is that that which is without parts cannot be in 
<A NAME="841"></A>motion except accidentally: i.e. it can be in motion only in so far as 
<A NAME="842"></A>the body or the magnitude is in motion and the partless is in motion by 
<A NAME="843"></A>inclusion therein, just as that which is in a boat may be in motion in 
<A NAME="844"></A>consequence of the locomotion of the boat, or a part may be in motion in 
<A NAME="845"></A>virtue of the motion of the whole. (It must be remembered, however, that 
<A NAME="846"></A>by 'that which is without parts' I mean that which is quantitatively indivisible 
<A NAME="847"></A>(and that the case of the motion of a part is not exactly parallel): for 
<A NAME="848"></A>parts have motions belonging essentially and severally to themselves distinct 
<A NAME="849"></A>from the motion of the whole. The distinction may be seen most clearly 
<A NAME="850"></A>in the case of a revolving sphere, in which the velocities of the parts 
<A NAME="851"></A>near the centre and of those on the surface are different from one another 
<A NAME="852"></A>and from that of the whole; this implies that there is not one motion but 
<A NAME="853"></A>many). As we have said, then, that which is without parts can be in motion 
<A NAME="854"></A>in the sense in which a man sitting in a boat is in motion when the boat 
<A NAME="855"></A>is travelling, but it cannot be in motion of itself. For suppose that it 
<A NAME="856"></A>is changing from AB to BG-either from one magnitude to another, or from 
<A NAME="857"></A>one form to another, or from some state to its contradictory-and let D 
<A NAME="858"></A>be the primary time in which it undergoes the change. Then in the time 
<A NAME="859"></A>in which it is changing it must be either in AB or in BG or partly in one 
<A NAME="860"></A>and partly in the other: for this, as we saw, is true of everything that 
<A NAME="861"></A>is changing. Now it cannot be partly in each of the two: for then it would 
<A NAME="862"></A>be divisible into parts. Nor again can it be in BG: for then it will have 
<A NAME="863"></A>completed the change, whereas the assumption is that the change is in process. 
<A NAME="864"></A>It remains, then, that in the time in which it is changing, it is in Ab. 
<A NAME="865"></A>That being so, it will be at rest: for, as we saw, to be in the same condition 
<A NAME="866"></A>for a period of time is to be at rest. So it is not possible for that which 
<A NAME="867"></A>has no parts to be in motion or to change in any way: for only one condition 
<A NAME="868"></A>could have made it possible for it to have motion, viz. that time should 
<A NAME="869"></A>be composed of moments, in which case at any moment it would have completed 
<A NAME="870"></A>a motion or a change, so that it would never be in motion, but would always 
<A NAME="871"></A>have been in motion. But this we have already shown above to be impossible: 
<A NAME="872"></A>time is not composed of moments, just as a line is not composed of points, 
<A NAME="873"></A>and motion is not composed of starts: for this theory simply makes motion 
<A NAME="874"></A>consist of indivisibles in exactly the same way as time is made to consist 
<A NAME="875"></A>of moments or a length of points.
<A NAME="876"></A><BR><BR>Again, it may be shown in the following way that there can be no 
<A NAME="877"></A>motion of a point or of any other indivisible. That which is in motion 
<A NAME="878"></A>can never traverse a space greater than itself without first traversing 
<A NAME="879"></A>a space equal to or less than itself. That being so, it is evident that 
<A NAME="880"></A>the point also must first traverse a space equal to or less than itself. 
<A NAME="881"></A>But since it is indivisible, there can be no space less than itself for 
<A NAME="882"></A>it to traverse first: so it will have to traverse a distance equal to itself. 
<A NAME="883"></A>Thus the line will be composed of points, for the point, as it continually 
<A NAME="884"></A>traverses a distance equal to itself, will be a measure of the whole line. 
<A NAME="885"></A>But since this is impossible, it is likewise impossible for the indivisible 
<A NAME="886"></A>to be in motion.
<A NAME="887"></A><BR><BR>Again, since motion is always in a period of time and never in 
<A NAME="888"></A>a moment, and all time is divisible, for everything that is in motion there 
<A NAME="889"></A>must be a time less than that in which it traverses a distance as great 
<A NAME="890"></A>as itself. For that in which it is in motion will be a time, because all 
<A NAME="891"></A>motion is in a period of time; and all time has been shown above to be 
<A NAME="892"></A>divisible. Therefore, if a point is in motion, there must be a time less 
<A NAME="893"></A>than that in which it has itself traversed any distance. But this is impossible, 
<A NAME="894"></A>for in less time it must traverse less distance, and thus the indivisible 
<A NAME="895"></A>will be divisible into something less than itself, just as the time is 
<A NAME="896"></A>so divisible: the fact being that the only condition under which that which 
<A NAME="897"></A>is without parts and indivisible could be in motion would have been the 
<A NAME="898"></A>possibility of the infinitely small being in motion in a moment: for in 
<A NAME="899"></A>the two questions-that of motion in a moment and that of motion of something 
<A NAME="900"></A>indivisible-the same principle is involved.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR>Our next point is that no process of change is infinite: for every 
<A NAME="902"></A>change, whether between contradictories or between contraries, is a change 
<A NAME="903"></A>from something to something. Thus in contradictory changes the positive 
<A NAME="904"></A>or the negative, as the case may be, is the limit, e.g. being is the limit 
<A NAME="905"></A>of coming to be and not-being is the limit of ceasing to be: and in contrary 
<A NAME="906"></A>changes the particular contraries are the limits, since these are the extreme 
<A NAME="907"></A>points of any such process of change, and consequently of every process 
<A NAME="908"></A>of alteration: for alteration is always dependent upon some contraries. 
<A NAME="909"></A>Similarly contraries are the extreme points of processes of increase and 
<A NAME="910"></A>decrease: the limit of increase is to be found in the complete magnitude 
<A NAME="911"></A>proper to the peculiar nature of the thing that is increasing, while the 
<A NAME="912"></A>limit of decrease is the complete loss of such magnitude. Locomotion, it 
<A NAME="913"></A>is true, we cannot show to be finite in this way, since it is not always 
<A NAME="914"></A>between contraries. But since that which cannot be cut (in the sense that 
<A NAME="915"></A>it is inconceivable that it should be cut, the term 'cannot' being used 
<A NAME="916"></A>in several senses)-since it is inconceivable that that which in this sense 
<A NAME="917"></A>cannot be cut should be in process of being cut, and generally that that 
<A NAME="918"></A>which cannot come to be should be in process of coming to be, it follows 
<A NAME="919"></A>that it is inconceivable that that which cannot complete a change should 
<A NAME="920"></A>be in process of changing to that to which it cannot complete a change. 
<A NAME="921"></A>If, then, it is to be assumed that that which is in locomotion is in process 
<A NAME="922"></A>of changing, it must be capable of completing the change. Consequently 
<A NAME="923"></A>its motion is not infinite, and it will not be in locomotion over an infinite 
<A NAME="924"></A>distance, for it cannot traverse such a distance.
<A NAME="925"></A><BR><BR>It is evident, then, that a process of change cannot be infinite 
<A NAME="926"></A>in the sense that it is not defined by limits. But it remains to be considered 
<A NAME="927"></A>whether it is possible in the sense that one and the same process of change 
<A NAME="928"></A>may be infinite in respect of the time which it occupies. If it is not 
<A NAME="929"></A>one process, it would seem that there is nothing to prevent its being infinite 
<A NAME="930"></A>in this sense; e.g. if a process of locomotion be succeeded by a process 
<A NAME="931"></A>of alteration and that by a process of increase and that again by a process 
<A NAME="932"></A>of coming to be: in this way there may be motion for ever so far as the 
<A NAME="933"></A>time is concerned, but it will not be one motion, because all these motions 
<A NAME="934"></A>do not compose one. If it is to be one process, no motion can be infinite 
<A NAME="935"></A>in respect of the time that it occupies, with the single exception of rotatory 
<A NAME="936"></A>locomotion.
