<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>As to the parts internal and external that all animals are furnished withal, 
<A NAME="12"></A>and further as to the senses, to voice, and sleep, and the duality sex, 
<A NAME="13"></A>all these topics have now been touched upon. It now remains for us to discuss, 
<A NAME="14"></A>duly and in order, their several modes of propagation.
<A NAME="15"></A><BR><BR>These modes are many and diverse, and in some respects are like, 
<A NAME="16"></A>and in other respects are unlike to one another. As we carried on our previous 
<A NAME="17"></A>discussion genus by genus, so we must attempt to follow the same divisions 
<A NAME="18"></A>in our present argument; only that whereas in the former case we started 
<A NAME="19"></A>with a consideration of the parts of man, in the present case it behoves 
<A NAME="20"></A>us to treat of man last of all because he involves most discussion. We 
<A NAME="21"></A>shall commence, then, with testaceans, and then proceed to crustaceans, 
<A NAME="22"></A>and then to the other genera in due order; and these other genera are, 
<A NAME="23"></A>severally, molluscs, and insects, then fishes viviparous and fishes oviparous, 
<A NAME="24"></A>and next birds; and afterwards we shall treat of animals provided with 
<A NAME="25"></A>feet, both such as are oviparous and such as are viviparous, and we may 
<A NAME="26"></A>observe that some quadrupeds are viviparous, but that the only viviparous 
<A NAME="27"></A>biped is man.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>Now there is one property that animals are found to have in common 
<A NAME="29"></A>with plants. For some plants are generated from the seed of plants, whilst 
<A NAME="30"></A>other plants are self-generated through the formation of some elemental 
<A NAME="31"></A>principle similar to a seed; and of these latter plants some derive their 
<A NAME="32"></A>nutriment from the ground, whilst others grow inside other plants, as is 
<A NAME="33"></A>mentioned, by the way, in my treatise on Botany. So with animals, some 
<A NAME="34"></A>spring from parent animals according to their kind, whilst others grow 
<A NAME="35"></A>spontaneously and not from kindred stock; and of these instances of spontaneous 
<A NAME="36"></A>generation some come from putrefying earth or vegetable matter, as is the 
<A NAME="37"></A>case with a number of insects, while others are spontaneously generated 
<A NAME="38"></A>in the inside of animals out of the secretions of their several 
<A NAME="39"></A>organs.
<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>In animals where generation goes by heredity, wherever there is 
<A NAME="41"></A>duality of sex generation is due to copulation. In the group of fishes, 
<A NAME="42"></A>however, there are some that are neither male nor female, and these, while 
<A NAME="43"></A>they are identical generically with other fish, differ from them specifically; 
<A NAME="44"></A>but there are others that stand altogether isolated and apart by themselves. 
<A NAME="45"></A>Other fishes there are that are always female and never male, and from 
<A NAME="46"></A>them are conceived what correspond to the wind-eggs in birds. Such eggs, 
<A NAME="47"></A>by the way, in birds are all unfruitful; but it is their nature to be independently 
<A NAME="48"></A>capable of generation up to the egg-stage, unless indeed there be some 
<A NAME="49"></A>other mode than the one familiar to us of intercourse with the male; but 
<A NAME="50"></A>concerning these topics we shall treat more precisely later on. In the 
<A NAME="51"></A>case of certain fishes, however, after they have spontaneously generated 
<A NAME="52"></A>eggs, these eggs develop into living animals; only that in certain of these 
<A NAME="53"></A>cases development is spontaneous, and in others is not independent of the 
<A NAME="54"></A>male; and the method of proceeding in regard to these matters will set 
<A NAME="55"></A>forth by and by, for the method is somewhat like to the method followed 
<A NAME="56"></A>in the case of birds. But whensoever creatures are spontaneously generated, 
<A NAME="57"></A>either in other animals, in the soil, or on plants, or in the parts of 
<A NAME="58"></A>these, and when such are generated male and female, then from the copulation 
<A NAME="59"></A>of such spontaneously generated males and females there is generated a 
<A NAME="60"></A>something-a something never identical in shape with the parents, but a 
<A NAME="61"></A>something imperfect. For instance, the issue of copulation in lice is nits; 
<A NAME="62"></A>in flies, grubs; in fleas, grubs egg-like in shape; and from these issues 
<A NAME="63"></A>the parent-species is never reproduced, nor is any animal produced at all, 
<A NAME="64"></A>but the like nondescripts only.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>First, then, we must proceed to treat of 'covering' in regard to 
<A NAME="66"></A>such animals as cover and are covered; and then after this to treat in 
<A NAME="67"></A>due order of other matters, both the exceptional and those of general 
<A NAME="68"></A>occurrence.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="69"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>Those animals, then, cover and are covered in which there is a 
<A NAME="71"></A>duality of sex, and the modes of covering in such animals are not in all 
<A NAME="72"></A>cases similar nor analogous. For the red-blooded animals that are viviparous 
<A NAME="73"></A>and furnished with feet have in all cases organs adapted for procreation, 
<A NAME="74"></A>but the sexes do not in all cases come together in like manner. Thus, opisthuretic 
<A NAME="75"></A>animals copulate with a rearward presentment, as is the case with the lion, 
<A NAME="76"></A>the hare, and the lynx; though, by the way, in the case of the hare, the 
<A NAME="77"></A>female is often observed to cover the male.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>The case is similar in most other such animals; that is to say, 
<A NAME="79"></A>the majority of quadrupeds copulate as best they can, the male mounting 
<A NAME="80"></A>the female; and this is the only method of copulating adopted by birds, 
<A NAME="81"></A>though there are certain diversities of method observed even in birds. 
<A NAME="82"></A>For in some cases the female squats on the ground and the male mounts on 
<A NAME="83"></A>top of her, as is the case with the cock and hen bustard, and the barn-door 
<A NAME="84"></A>cock and hen; in other cases, the male mounts without the female squatting, 
<A NAME="85"></A>as with the male and female crane; for, with these birds, the male mounts 
<A NAME="86"></A>on to the back of the female and covers her, and like the cock-sparrow 
<A NAME="87"></A>consumes but very little time in the operation. Of quadrupeds, bears perform 
<A NAME="88"></A>the operation lying prone on one another, in the same way as other quadrupeds 
<A NAME="89"></A>do while standing up; that is to say, with the belly of the male pressed 
<A NAME="90"></A>to the back of the female. Hedgehogs copulate erect, belly to 
<A NAME="91"></A>belly.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>With regard to large-sized vivipara, the hind only very rarely 
<A NAME="93"></A>sustains the mounting of the stag to the full conclusion of the operation, 
<A NAME="94"></A>and the same is the case with the cow as regards the bull, owing to the 
<A NAME="95"></A>rigidity of the penis of the bull. In point of fact, the females of these 
<A NAME="96"></A>animals elicit the sperm of the male in the act of withdrawing from underneath 
<A NAME="97"></A>him; and, by the way, this phenomenon has been observed in the case of 
<A NAME="98"></A>the stag and hind, domesticated, of course. Covering with the wolf is the 
<A NAME="99"></A>same as with the dog. Cats do not copulate with a rearward presentment 
<A NAME="100"></A>on the part of the female, but the male stands erect and the female puts 
<A NAME="101"></A>herself underneath him; and, by the way, the female cat is peculiarly lecherous, 
<A NAME="102"></A>and wheedles the male on to sexual commerce, and caterwauls during the 
<A NAME="103"></A>operation. Camels copulate with the female in a sitting posture, and the 
<A NAME="104"></A>male straddles over and covers her, not with the hinder presentment on 
<A NAME="105"></A>the female's part but like the other quadrupeds mentioned above, and they 
<A NAME="106"></A>pass the whole day long in the operation; when thus engaged they retire 
<A NAME="107"></A>to lonely spots, and none but their keeper dare approach them. And, be 
<A NAME="108"></A>it observed, the penis of the camel is so sinewy that bow-strings are manufactured 
<A NAME="109"></A>out of it. Elephants, also, copulate in lonely places, and especially by 
<A NAME="110"></A>river-sides in their usual haunts; the female squats down, and straddles 
<A NAME="111"></A>with her legs, and the male mounts and covers her. The seal covers like 
<A NAME="112"></A>all opisthuretic animals, and in this species the copulation extends over 
<A NAME="113"></A>a lengthened time, as is the case with the dog and bitch; and the penis 
<A NAME="114"></A>in the male seal is exceptionally large.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="115"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>Oviparous quadrupeds cover one another in the same way. That is 
<A NAME="117"></A>to say, in some cases the male mounts the female precisely as in the viviparous 
<A NAME="118"></A>animals, as is observed in both the land and the sea tortoise....And these 
<A NAME="119"></A>creatures have an organ in which the ducts converge, and with which they 
<A NAME="120"></A>perform the act of copulation, as is also observed in the toad, the frog, 
<A NAME="121"></A>and all other animals of the same group.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="122"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>Long animals devoid of feet, like serpents and muraenae, intertwine 
<A NAME="124"></A>in coition, belly to belly. And, in fact, serpents coil round one another 
<A NAME="125"></A>so tightly as to present the appearance of a single serpent with a pair 
<A NAME="126"></A>of heads. The same mode is followed by the saurians; that is to say, they 
<A NAME="127"></A>coil round one another in the act of coition.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="128"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>All fishes, with the exception of the flat selachians, lie down 
<A NAME="130"></A>side by side, and copulate belly to belly. Fishes, however, that are flat 
<A NAME="131"></A>and furnished with tails-as the ray, the trygon, and the like-copulate 
<A NAME="132"></A>not only in this way, but also, where the tail from its thinness is no 
<A NAME="133"></A>impediment, by mounting of the male upon the female, belly to back. But 
<A NAME="134"></A>the rhina or angel-fish, and other like fishes where the tail is large, 
<A NAME="135"></A>copulate only by rubbing against one another sideways, belly to belly. 
<A NAME="136"></A>Some men assure us that they have seen some of the selachia copulating 
<A NAME="137"></A>hindways, dog and bitch. In the cartilaginous species the female is larger 
<A NAME="138"></A>than the male; and the same is the case with other fishes for the most 
<A NAME="139"></A>part. And among cartilaginous fishes are included, besides those already 
<A NAME="140"></A>named, the bos, the lamia, the aetos, the narce or torpedo, the fishing-frog, 
<A NAME="141"></A>and all the galeodes or sharks and dogfish. Cartilaginous fishes, then, 
<A NAME="142"></A>of all kinds, have in many instances been observed copulating in the way 
<A NAME="143"></A>above mentioned; for, by the way, in viviparous animals the process of 
<A NAME="144"></A>copulation is of longer duration than in the ovipara.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>It is the same with the dolphin and with all cetaceans; that is 
<A NAME="146"></A>to say, they come side by side, male and female, and copulate, and the 
<A NAME="147"></A>act extends over a time which is neither short nor very 
<A NAME="148"></A>long.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>Again, in cartilaginous fishes the male, in some species, differs 
<A NAME="150"></A>from the female in the fact that he is furnished with two appendages hanging 
<A NAME="151"></A>down from about the exit of the residuum, and that the female is not so 
<A NAME="152"></A>furnished; and this distinction between the sexes is observed in all the 
<A NAME="153"></A>species of the sharks and dog-fish.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>Now neither fishes nor any animals devoid of feet are furnished 
<A NAME="155"></A>with testicles, but male serpents and male fishes have a pair of ducts 
<A NAME="156"></A>which fill with milt or sperm at the rutting season, and discharge, in 
<A NAME="157"></A>all cases, a milk-like juice. These ducts unite, as in birds; for birds, 
<A NAME="158"></A>by the way, have their testicles in their interior, and so have all ovipara 
<A NAME="159"></A>that are furnished with feet. And this union of the ducts is so far continued 
<A NAME="160"></A>and of such extension as to enter the receptive organ in the 
<A NAME="161"></A>female.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>In viviparous animals furnished with feet there is outwardly one 
<A NAME="163"></A>and the same duct for the sperm and the liquid residuum; but there are 
<A NAME="164"></A>separate ducts internally, as has been observed in the differentiation 
<A NAME="165"></A>of the organs. And with such animals as are not viviparous the same passage 
<A NAME="166"></A>serves for the discharge also of the solid residuum; although, internally, 
<A NAME="167"></A>there are two passages, separate but near to one another. And these remarks 
<A NAME="168"></A>apply to both male and female; for these animals are unprovided with a 
<A NAME="169"></A>bladder except in the case of the tortoise; and the she-tortoise, though 
<A NAME="170"></A>furnished with a bladder, has only one passage; and tortoises, by the way, 
<A NAME="171"></A>belong to the ovipara.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>In the case of oviparous fishes the process of coition is less 
<A NAME="173"></A>open to observation. In point of fact, some are led by the want of actual 
<A NAME="174"></A>observation to surmise that the female becomes impregnated by swallowing 
<A NAME="175"></A>the seminal fluid of the male. And there can be no doubt that this proceeding 
<A NAME="176"></A>on the part of the female is often witnessed; for at the rutting season 
<A NAME="177"></A>the females follow the males and perform this operation, and strike the 
<A NAME="178"></A>males with their mouths under the belly, and the males are thereby induced 
<A NAME="179"></A>to part with the sperm sooner and more plentifully. And, further, at the 
<A NAME="180"></A>spawning season the males go in pursuit of the females, and, as the female 
<A NAME="181"></A>spawns, the males swallow the eggs; and the species is continued in existence 
<A NAME="182"></A>by the spawn that survives this process. On the coast of Phoenicia they 
<A NAME="183"></A>take advantage of these instinctive propensities of the two sexes to catch 
<A NAME="184"></A>both one and the other: that is to say, by using the male of the grey mullet 
<A NAME="185"></A>as a decoy they collect and net the female, and by using the female, the 
<A NAME="186"></A>male.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>The repeated observation of this phenomenon has led to the notion 
<A NAME="188"></A>that the process was equivalent to coition, but the fact is that a similar 
<A NAME="189"></A>phenomenon is observable in quadrupeds. For at the rutting seasons both 
<A NAME="190"></A>the males and the females take to running at their genitals, and the two 
<A NAME="191"></A>sexes take to smelling each other at those parts. (With partridges, by 
<A NAME="192"></A>the way, if the female gets to leeward of the male, she becomes thereby 
<A NAME="193"></A>impregnated. And often when they happen to be in heat she is affected in 
<A NAME="194"></A>this wise by the voice of the male, or by his breathing down on her as 
<A NAME="195"></A>he flies overhead; and, by the way, both the male and the female partridge 
<A NAME="196"></A>keep the mouth wide open and protrude the tongue in the process of 
<A NAME="197"></A>coition.)
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>The actual process of copulation on the part of oviparous fishes 
<A NAME="199"></A>is seldom accurately observed, owing to the fact that they very soon fall 
<A NAME="200"></A>aside and slip asunder. But, for all that, the process has been observed 
<A NAME="201"></A>to take place in the manner above described.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="202"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>Molluscs, such as the octopus, the sepia, and the calamary, have 
<A NAME="204"></A>sexual intercourse all in the same way; that is to say, they unite at the 
<A NAME="205"></A>mouth, by an interlacing of their tentacles. When, then, the octopus rests 
<A NAME="206"></A>its so-called head against the ground and spreads abroad its tentacles, 
<A NAME="207"></A>the other sex fits into the outspreading of these tentacles, and the two 
<A NAME="208"></A>sexes then bring their suckers into mutual connexion.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>Some assert that the male has a kind of penis in one of his tentacles, 
<A NAME="210"></A>the one in which are the largest suckers; and they further assert that 
<A NAME="211"></A>the organ is tendinous in character, growing attached right up to the middle 
<A NAME="212"></A>of the tentacle, and that the latter enables it to enter the nostril or 
<A NAME="213"></A>funnel of the female.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>Now cuttle-fish and calamaries swim about closely intertwined, 
<A NAME="215"></A>with mouths and tentacles facing one another and fitting closely together, 
<A NAME="216"></A>and swim thus in opposite directions; and they fit their so-called nostrils 
<A NAME="217"></A>into one another, and the one sex swims backwards and the other frontwards 
<A NAME="218"></A>during the operation. And the female lays its spawn by the so-called 'blow-hole'; 
<A NAME="219"></A>and, by the way, some declare that it is at this organ that the coition 
<A NAME="220"></A>really takes place.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="221"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>Crustaceans copulate, as the crawfish, the lobster, the carid and 
<A NAME="223"></A>the like, just like the opisthuretic quadrupeds, when the one animal turns 
<A NAME="224"></A>up its tail and the other puts his tail on the other's tail. Copulation 
<A NAME="225"></A>takes place in the early spring, near to the shore; and, in fact, the process 
<A NAME="226"></A>has often been observed in the case of all these animals. Sometimes it 
<A NAME="227"></A>takes place about the time when the figs begin to ripen. Lobsters and carids 
<A NAME="228"></A>copulate in like manner.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>Crabs copulate at the front parts of one another, belly to belly, 
<A NAME="230"></A>throwing their overlapping opercula to meet one another: first the smaller 
<A NAME="231"></A>crab mounts the larger at the rear; after he has mounted, the larger one 
<A NAME="232"></A>turns on one side. Now, the female differs in no respect from the male 
<A NAME="233"></A>except in the circumstance that its operculum is larger, more elevated, 
<A NAME="234"></A>and more hairy, and into this operculum it spawns its eggs and in the same 
<A NAME="235"></A>neighbourhood is the outlet of the residuum. In the copulative process 
<A NAME="236"></A>of these animals there is no protrusion of a member from one animal into 
<A NAME="237"></A>the other.

<A NAME="238"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>Insects copulate at the hinder end, and the smaller individuals 
<A NAME="240"></A>mount the larger; and the smaller individual is I I is the male. The female 
<A NAME="241"></A>pushes from underneath her sexual organ into the body of the male above, 
<A NAME="242"></A>this being the reverse of the operation observed in other creatures; and 
<A NAME="243"></A>this organ in the case of some insects appears to be disproportionately 
<A NAME="244"></A>large when compared to the size of the body, and that too in very minute 
<A NAME="245"></A>creatures; in some insects the disproportion is not so striking. This phenomenon 
<A NAME="246"></A>may be witnessed if any one will pull asunder flies that are copulating; 
<A NAME="247"></A>and, by the way, these creatures are, under the circumstances, averse to 
<A NAME="248"></A>separation; for the intercourse of the sexes in their case is of long duration, 
<A NAME="249"></A>as may be observed with common everyday insects, such as the fly and the 
<A NAME="250"></A>cantharis. They all copulate in the manner above described, the fly, the 
<A NAME="251"></A>cantharis, the sphondyle, (the phalangium spider) any others of the kind 
<A NAME="252"></A>that copulate at all. The phalangia-that is to say, such of the species 
<A NAME="253"></A>as spin webs-perform the operation in the following way: the female takes 
<A NAME="254"></A>hold of the suspended web at the middle and gives a pull, and the male 
<A NAME="255"></A>gives a counter pull; this operation they repeat until they are drawn in 
<A NAME="256"></A>together and interlaced at the hinder ends; for, by the way, this mode 
<A NAME="257"></A>of copulation suits them in consequence of the rotundity of their 
<A NAME="258"></A>stomachs.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>So much for the modes of sexual intercourse in all animals; but, 
<A NAME="260"></A>with regard to the same phenomenon, there are definite laws followed as 
<A NAME="261"></A>regards the season of the year and the age of the animal.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>Animals in general seem naturally disposed to this intercourse 
<A NAME="263"></A>at about the same period of the year, and that is when winter is changing 
<A NAME="264"></A>into summer. And this is the season of spring, in which almost all things 
<A NAME="265"></A>that fly or walk or swim take to pairing. Some animals pair and breed in 
<A NAME="266"></A>autumn also and in winter, as is the case with certain aquatic animals 
<A NAME="267"></A>and certain birds. Man pairs and breeds at all seasons, as is the case 
<A NAME="268"></A>also with domesticated animals, owing to the shelter and good feeding they 
<A NAME="269"></A>enjoy: that is to say, with those whose period of gestation is also comparatively 
<A NAME="270"></A>brief, as the sow and the bitch, and with those birds that breed frequently. 
<A NAME="271"></A>Many animals time the season of intercourse with a view to the right nurture 
<A NAME="272"></A>subsequently of their young. In the human species, the male is more under 
<A NAME="273"></A>sexual excitement in winter, and the female in summer.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>With birds the far greater part, as has been said, pair and breed 
<A NAME="275"></A>during the spring and early summer, with the exception of the 
<A NAME="276"></A>halcyon.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>The halcyon breeds at the season of the winter solstice. Accordingly, 
<A NAME="278"></A>when this season is marked with calm weather, the name of 'halcyon days' 
<A NAME="279"></A>is given to the seven days preceding, and to as many following, the solstice; 
<A NAME="280"></A>as Simonides the poet says:
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR><B>God lulls for fourteen days the winds to sleep</B> <B>In winter; 
<A NAME="282"></A>and this temperate interlude</B> <B>Men call the Holy Season, when the 
<A NAME="283"></A>deep</B> <B>Cradles the mother Halcyon and her brood.</B>
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>And these days are calm, when southerly winds prevail at the solstice, 
<A NAME="285"></A>northerly ones having been the accompaniment of the Pleiads. The halcyon 
<A NAME="286"></A>is said to take seven days for building her nest, and the other seven for 
<A NAME="287"></A>laying and hatching her eggs. In our country there are not always halcyon 
<A NAME="288"></A>days about the time of the winter solstice, but in the Sicilian seas this 
<A NAME="289"></A>season of calm is almost periodical. The bird lays about five 
<A NAME="290"></A>eggs.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="291"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>(The aithyia, or diver, and the larus, or gull, lay their eggs 
<A NAME="293"></A>on rocks bordering on the sea, two or three at a time; but the gull lays 
<A NAME="294"></A>in the summer, and the diver at the beginning of spring, just after the 
<A NAME="295"></A>winter solstice, and it broods over its eggs as birds do in general. And 
<A NAME="296"></A>neither of these birds resorts to a hiding-place.)
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>The halcyon is the most rarely seen of all birds. It is seen only 
<A NAME="298"></A>about the time of the setting of the Pleiads and the winter solstice. When 
<A NAME="299"></A>ships are lying at anchor in the roads, it will hover about a vessel and 
<A NAME="300"></A>then disappear in a moment, and Stesichorus in one of his poems alludes 
<A NAME="301"></A>to this peculiarity. The nightingale also breeds at the beginning of summer, 
<A NAME="302"></A>and lays five or six eggs; from autumn until spring it retires to a 
<A NAME="303"></A>hiding-place.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>Insects copulate and breed in winter also, that is when the weather 
<A NAME="305"></A>is fine and south winds prevail; such, I mean, as do not hibernate, as 
<A NAME="306"></A>the fly and the ant. The greater part of wild animals bring forth once 
<A NAME="307"></A>and once only in the year, except in the case of animals like the hare, 
<A NAME="308"></A>where the female can become superfoetally impregnated.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>In like manner the great majority of fishes breed only once a year, 
<A NAME="310"></A>like the shoal-fishes (or, in other words, such as are caught in nets), 
<A NAME="311"></A>the tunny, the pelamys, the grey mullet, the chalcis, the mackerel, the 
<A NAME="312"></A>sciaena, the psetta and the like, with the exception of the labrax or basse; 
<A NAME="313"></A>for this fish (alone amongst those mentioned) breeds twice a year, and 
<A NAME="314"></A>the second brood is the weaker of the two. The trichias and the rock-fishes 
<A NAME="315"></A>breed twice a year; the red mullet breeds thrice a year, and is exceptional 
<A NAME="316"></A>in this respect. This conclusion in regard to the red mullet is inferred 
<A NAME="317"></A>from the spawn; for the spawn of the fish may be seen in certain places 
<A NAME="318"></A>at three different times of the year. The scorpaena breeds twice a year. 
<A NAME="319"></A>The sargue breeds twice, in the spring and in the autumn. The saupe breeds 
<A NAME="320"></A>once a year only, in the autumn. The female tunny breeds only once a year, 
<A NAME="321"></A>but owing to the fact that the fish in some cases spawn early and in others 
<A NAME="322"></A>late, it looks as though the fish bred twice over. The first spawning takes 
<A NAME="323"></A>place in December before the solstice, and the latter spawning in the spring. 
<A NAME="324"></A>The male tunny differs from the female in being unprovided with the fin 
<A NAME="325"></A>beneath the belly which is called aphareus.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="326"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>Of cartilaginous fishes, the rhina or angelfish is the only one 
<A NAME="328"></A>that breeds twice; for it breeds at the beginning of autumn, and at the 
<A NAME="329"></A>setting of the Pleiads: and, of the two seasons, it is in better condition 
<A NAME="330"></A>in the autumn. It engenders at a birth seven or eight young. Certain of 
<A NAME="331"></A>the dog-fishes, for example the spotted dog, seem to breed twice a month, 
<A NAME="332"></A>and this results from the circumstance that the eggs do not all reach maturity 
<A NAME="333"></A>at the same time.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>Some fishes breed at all seasons, as the muraena. This animal lays 
<A NAME="335"></A>a great number of eggs at a time; and the young when hatched are very small 
<A NAME="336"></A>but grow with great rapidity, like the young of the hippurus, for these 
<A NAME="337"></A>fishes from being diminutive at the outset grow with exceptional rapidity 
<A NAME="338"></A>to an exceptional size. (Be it observed that the muraena breeds at all 
<A NAME="339"></A>seasons, but the hippurus only in the spring. The smyrus differs from the 
<A NAME="340"></A>smyraena; for the muraena is mottled and weakly, whereas the smyrus is 
<A NAME="341"></A>strong and of one uniform colour, and the colour resembles that of the 
<A NAME="342"></A>pine-tree, and the animal has teeth inside and out. They say that in this 
<A NAME="343"></A>case, as in other similar ones, the one is the male, and the other the 
<A NAME="344"></A>female, of a single species. They come out on to the land, and are frequently 
<A NAME="345"></A>caught.) Fishes, then, as a general rule, attain their full growth with 
<A NAME="346"></A>great rapidity, but this is especially the case, among small fishes, with 
<A NAME="347"></A>the coracine or crow-fish: it spawns, by the way, near the shore, in weedy 
<A NAME="348"></A>and tangled spots. The orphus also, or sea-perch, is small at first, and 
<A NAME="349"></A>rapidly attains a great size. The pelamys and the tunny breed in the Euxine, 
<A NAME="350"></A>and nowhere else. The cestreus or mullet, the chrysophrys or gilt-head, 
<A NAME="351"></A>and the labrax or basse, breed best where rivers run into the sea. The 
<A NAME="352"></A>orcys or large-sized tunny, the scorpis, and many other species spawn in 
<A NAME="353"></A>the open sea.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="354"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="355"></A><BR><BR>Fish for the most part breed some time or other during the three 
<A NAME="356"></A>months between the middle of March and the middle of June. Some few breed 
<A NAME="357"></A>in autumn: as, for instance, the saupe and the sargus, and such others 
<A NAME="358"></A>of this sort as breed shortly before the autumn equinox; likewise the electric 
<A NAME="359"></A>ray and the angel-fish. Other fishes breed both in winter and in summer, 
<A NAME="360"></A>as was previously observed: as, for instance, in winter-time the basse, 
<A NAME="361"></A>the grey mullet, and the belone or pipe-fish; and in summer-time, from 
<A NAME="362"></A>the middle of June to the middle of July, the female tunny, about the time 
<A NAME="363"></A>of the summer solstice; and the tunny lays a sac-like enclosure in which 
<A NAME="364"></A>are contained a number of small eggs. The ryades or shoal-fishes breed 
<A NAME="365"></A>in summer.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>Of the grey mullets, the chelon begins to be in roe between the 
<A NAME="367"></A>middle of November and the middle of December; as also the sargue, and 
<A NAME="368"></A>the smyxon or myxon, and the cephalus; and their period of gestation is 
<A NAME="369"></A>thirty days. And, by the way, some of the grey mullet species are not produced 
<A NAME="370"></A>from copulation, but grow spontaneously from mud and 
<A NAME="371"></A>sand.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>As a general rule, then, fishes are in roe in the spring-time; 
<A NAME="373"></A>while some, as has been said, are so in summer, in autumn, or in winter. 
<A NAME="374"></A>But whereas the impregnation in the spring-time follows a general law, 
<A NAME="375"></A>impregnation in the other seasons does not follow the same rule either 
<A NAME="376"></A>throughout or within the limits of one genus; and, further, conception 
<A NAME="377"></A>in these variant seasons is not so prolific. And, indeed, we must bear 
<A NAME="378"></A>this in mind, that just as with plants and quadrupeds diversity of locality 
<A NAME="379"></A>has much to do not only with general physical health but also with the 
<A NAME="380"></A>comparative frequency of sexual intercourse and generation, so also with 
<A NAME="381"></A>regard to fishes locality of itself has much to do not only in regard to 
<A NAME="382"></A>the size and vigour of the creature, but also in regard to its parturition 
<A NAME="383"></A>and its copulations, causing the same species to breed oftener in one place 
<A NAME="384"></A>and seldomer in another.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="385"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>The molluscs also breed in spring. Of the marine molluscs one of 
<A NAME="387"></A>the first to breed is the sepia. It spawns at all times of the day and 
<A NAME="388"></A>its period of gestation is fifteen days. After the female has laid her 
<A NAME="389"></A>eggs, the male comes and discharges the milt over the eggs, and the eggs 
<A NAME="390"></A>thereupon harden. And the two sexes of this animal go about in pairs, side 
<A NAME="391"></A>by side; and the male is more mottled and more black on the back than the 
<A NAME="392"></A>female.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>The octopus pairs in winter and breeds in spring, lying hidden 
<A NAME="394"></A>for about two months. Its spawn is shaped like a vine-tendril, and resembles 
<A NAME="395"></A>the fruit of the white poplar; the creature is extraordinarily prolific, 
<A NAME="396"></A>for the number of individuals that come from the spawn is something incalculable. 
<A NAME="397"></A>The male differs from the female in the fact that its head is longer, and 
<A NAME="398"></A>that the organ called by the fishermen its penis, in the tentacle, is white. 
<A NAME="399"></A>The female, after laying her eggs, broods over them, and in consequence 
<A NAME="400"></A>gets out of condition, by reason of not going in quest of food during the 
<A NAME="401"></A>hatching period.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>The purple murex breeds about springtime, and the ceryx at the 
<A NAME="403"></A>close of the winter. And, as a general rule, the testaceans are found to 
<A NAME="404"></A>be furnished with their so-called eggs in spring-time and in autumn, with 
<A NAME="405"></A>the exception of the edible urchin; for this animal has the so-called eggs 
<A NAME="406"></A>in most abundance in these seasons, but at no season is unfurnished with 
<A NAME="407"></A>them; and it is furnished with them in especial abundance in warm weather 
<A NAME="408"></A>or when a full moon is in the sky. Only, by the way, these remarks do not 
<A NAME="409"></A>apply to the sea-urchin found in the Pyrrhaean Straits, for this urchin 
<A NAME="410"></A>is at its best for table purposes in the winter; and these urchins are 
<A NAME="411"></A>small but full of eggs.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>Snails are found by observations to become in all cases impregnated 
<A NAME="413"></A>about the same season.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="414"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>(Of birds the wild species, as has been stated, as a general rule 
<A NAME="416"></A>pair and breed only once a year. The swallow, however, and the blackbird 
<A NAME="417"></A>breed twice. With regard to the blackbird, however, its first brood is 
<A NAME="418"></A>killed by inclemency of weather (for it is the earliest of all birds to 
<A NAME="419"></A>breed), but the second brood it usually succeeds in 
<A NAME="420"></A>rearing.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>Birds that are domesticated or that are capable of domestication 
<A NAME="422"></A>breed frequently, just as the common pigeon breeds all through the summer, 
<A NAME="423"></A>and as is seen in the barn-door hen; for the barn-door cock and hen have 
<A NAME="424"></A>intercourse, and the hen breeds, at all seasons alike: excepting by the 
<A NAME="425"></A>way, during the days about the winter solstice.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>Of the pigeon family there are many diversities; for the peristera 
<A NAME="427"></A>or common pigeon is not identical with the peleias or rock-pigeon. In other 
<A NAME="428"></A>words, the rock-pigeon is smaller than the common pigeon, and is less easily 
<A NAME="429"></A>domesticated; it is also black, and small, red-footed and rough-footed; 
<A NAME="430"></A>and in consequence of these peculiarities it is neglected by the pigeon-fancier. 
<A NAME="431"></A>The largest of all the pigeon species is the phatta or ring-dove; and the 
<A NAME="432"></A>next in size is the oenas or stock-dove; and the stock-dove is a little 
<A NAME="433"></A>larger than the common pigeon. The smallest of all the species is the turtle-dove. 
<A NAME="434"></A>Pigeons breed and hatch at all seasons, if they are furnished with a sunny 
<A NAME="435"></A>place and all requisites; unless they are so furnished, they breed only 
<A NAME="436"></A>in the summer. The spring brood is the best, or the autumn brood. At all 
<A NAME="437"></A>events, without doubt, the produce of the hot season, the summer brood, 
<A NAME="438"></A>is the poorest of the three.)
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="439"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>Further, animals differ from one another in regard to the time 
<A NAME="441"></A>of life that is best adapted for sexual intercourse.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>To begin with, in most animals the secretion of the seminal fluid 
<A NAME="443"></A>and its generative capacity are not phenomena simultaneously manifested, 
<A NAME="444"></A>but manifested successively. Thus, in all animals, the earliest secretion 
<A NAME="445"></A>of sperm is unfruitful, or if it be fruitful the issue is comparatively 
<A NAME="446"></A>poor and small. And this phenomenon is especially observable in man, in 
<A NAME="447"></A>viviparous quadrupeds, and in birds; for in the case of man and the quadruped 
<A NAME="448"></A>the offspring is smaller, and in the case of the bird, the 
<A NAME="449"></A>egg.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>For animals that copulate, of one and the same species, the age 
<A NAME="451"></A>for maturity is in most species tolerably uniform, unless it occurs prematurely 
<A NAME="452"></A>by reason of abnormality, or is postponed by physical 
<A NAME="453"></A>injury.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>In man, then, maturity is indicated by a change of the tone of 
<A NAME="455"></A>voice, by an increase in size and an alteration in appearance of the sexual 
<A NAME="456"></A>organs, as also in an increase of size and alteration in appearance of 
<A NAME="457"></A>the breasts; and above all, in the hair-growth at the pubes. Man begins 
<A NAME="458"></A>to possess seminal fluid about the age of fourteen, and becomes generatively 
<A NAME="459"></A>capable at about the age of twenty-one years.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>In other animals there is no hair-growth at the pubes (for some 
<A NAME="461"></A>animals have no hair at all, and others have none on the belly, or less 
<A NAME="462"></A>on the belly than on the back), but still, in some animals the change of 
<A NAME="463"></A>voice is quite obvious; and in some animals other organs give indication 
<A NAME="464"></A>of the commencing secretion of the sperm and the onset of generative capacity. 
<A NAME="465"></A>As a general rule the female is sharper-toned in voice than the male, and 
<A NAME="466"></A>the young animal than the elder; for, by the way, the stag has a much deeper-toned 
<A NAME="467"></A>bay than the hind. Moreover, the male cries chiefly at rutting time, and 
<A NAME="468"></A>the female under terror and alarm; and the cry of the female is short, 
<A NAME="469"></A>and that of the male prolonged. With dogs also, as they grow old, the tone 
<A NAME="470"></A>of the bark gets deeper.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>There is a difference observable also in the neighings of horses. 
<A NAME="472"></A>That is to say, the female foal has a thin small neigh, and the male foal 
<A NAME="473"></A>a small neigh, yet bigger and deeper-toned than that of the female, and 
<A NAME="474"></A>a louder one as time goes on. And when the young male and female are two 
<A NAME="475"></A>years old and take to breeding, the neighing of the stallion becomes loud 
<A NAME="476"></A>and deep, and that of the mare louder and shriller than heretofore; and 
<A NAME="477"></A>this change goes on until they reach the age of about twenty years; and 
<A NAME="478"></A>after this time the neighing in both sexes becomes weaker and 
<A NAME="479"></A>weaker.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR>As a rule, then, as was stated, the voice of the male differs from 
<A NAME="481"></A>the voice of the female, in animals where the voice admits of a continuous 
<A NAME="482"></A>and prolonged sound, in the fact that the note in the male voice is more 
<A NAME="483"></A>deep and bass; not, however, in all animals, for the contrary holds good 
<A NAME="484"></A>in the case of some, as for instance in kine: for here the cow has a deeper 
<A NAME="485"></A>note than the bull, and the calves a deeper note than the cattle. And we 
<A NAME="486"></A>can thus understand the change of voice in animals that undergo gelding; 
<A NAME="487"></A>for male animals that undergo this process assume the characters of the 
<A NAME="488"></A>female.
<A NAME="489"></A><BR><BR>The following are the ages at which various animals become capacitated 
<A NAME="490"></A>for sexual commerce. The ewe and the she-goat are sexually mature when 
<A NAME="491"></A>one year old, and this statement is made more confidently in respect to 
<A NAME="492"></A>the she-goat than to the ewe; the ram and the he-goat are sexually mature 
<A NAME="493"></A>at the same age. The progeny of very young individuals among these animals 
<A NAME="494"></A>differs from that of other males: for the males improve in the course of 
<A NAME="495"></A>the second year, when they become fully mature. The boar and the sow are 
<A NAME="496"></A>capable of intercourse when eight months old, and the female brings forth 
<A NAME="497"></A>when one year old, the difference corresponding to her period of gestation. 
<A NAME="498"></A>The boar is capable of generation when eight months old, but, with a sire 
<A NAME="499"></A>under a year in age, the litter is apt to be a poor one. The ages, however, 
<A NAME="500"></A>are not invariable; now and then the boar and the sow are capable of intercourse 
<A NAME="501"></A>when four months old, and are capable of producing a litter which can be 
<A NAME="502"></A>reared when six months old; but at times the boar begins to be capable 
<A NAME="503"></A>of intercourse when ten months. He continues sexually mature until he is 
<A NAME="504"></A>three years old. The dog and the bitch are, as a rule, sexually capable 
<A NAME="505"></A>and sexually receptive when a year old, and sometimes when eight months 
<A NAME="506"></A>old; but the priority in date is more common with the dog than with the 
<A NAME="507"></A>bitch. The period of gestation with the bitch is sixty days, or sixty-one, 
<A NAME="508"></A>or sixty-two, or sixty-three at the utmost; the period is never under sixty 
<A NAME="509"></A>days, or, if it is, the litter comes to no good. The bitch, after delivering 
<A NAME="510"></A>a litter, submits to the male in six months, but not before. The horse 
<A NAME="511"></A>and the mare are, at the earliest, sexually capable and sexually mature 
<A NAME="512"></A>when two years old; the issue, however, of parents of this age is small 
<A NAME="513"></A>and poor. As a general rule these animals are sexually capable when three 
<A NAME="514"></A>years old, and they grow better for breeding purposes until they reach 
<A NAME="515"></A>twenty years. The stallion is sexually capable up to the age of thirty-three 
<A NAME="516"></A>years, and the mare up to forty, so that, in point of fact, the animals 
<A NAME="517"></A>are sexually capable all their lives long; for the stallion, as a rule, 
<A NAME="518"></A>lives for about thirty-five years, and the mare for a little over forty; 
<A NAME="519"></A>although, by the way, a horse has known to live to the age of seventy-five. 
<A NAME="520"></A>The ass and the she-ass are sexually capable when thirty months old; but, 
<A NAME="521"></A>as a rule, they are not generatively mature until they are three years 
<A NAME="522"></A>old, or three years and a half. An instance has been known of a she-ass 
<A NAME="523"></A>bearing and bringing forth a foal when only a year old. A cow has been 
<A NAME="524"></A>known to calve when only a year old, and the calf grew as big as might 
<A NAME="525"></A>be expected, but no more. So much for the dates in time at which these 
<A NAME="526"></A>animals attain to generative capacity.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>In the human species, the male is generative, at the longest, up 
<A NAME="528"></A>to seventy years, and the female up to fifty; but such extended periods 
<A NAME="529"></A>are rare. As a rule, the male is generative up to the age of sixty-five, 
<A NAME="530"></A>and to the age of forty-five the female is capable of 
<A NAME="531"></A>conception.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR>The ewe bears up to eight years, and, if she be carefully tended, 
<A NAME="533"></A>up to eleven years; in fact, the ram and the ewe are sexually capable pretty 
<A NAME="534"></A>well all their lives long. He-goats, if they be fat, are more or less unserviceable 
<A NAME="535"></A>for breeding; and this, by the way, is the reason why country folk say 
<A NAME="536"></A>of a vine when it stops bearing that it is 'running the goat'. However, 
<A NAME="537"></A>if an over-fat he-goat be thinned down, he becomes sexually capable and 
<A NAME="538"></A>generative.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>Rams single out the oldest ewes for copulation, and show no regard 
<A NAME="540"></A>for the young ones. And, as has been stated, the issue of the younger ewes 
<A NAME="541"></A>is poorer than that of the older ones.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>The boar is good for breeding purposes until he is three years 
<A NAME="543"></A>of age; but after that age his issue deteriorates, for after that age his 
<A NAME="544"></A>vigour is on the decline. The boar is most capable after a good feed, and 
<A NAME="545"></A>with the first sow it mounts; if poorly fed or put to many females, the 
<A NAME="546"></A>copulation is abbreviated, and the litter is comparatively poor. The first 
<A NAME="547"></A>litter of the sow is the fewest in number; at the second litter she is 
<A NAME="548"></A>at her prime. The animal, as it grows old, continues to breed, but the 
<A NAME="549"></A>sexual desire abates. When they reach fifteen years, they become unproductive, 
<A NAME="550"></A>and are getting old. If a sow be highly fed, it is all the more eager for 
<A NAME="551"></A>sexual commerce, whether old or young; but, if it be over-fattened in pregnancy, 
<A NAME="552"></A>it gives the less milk after parturition. With regard to the age of the 
<A NAME="553"></A>parents, the litter is the best when they are in their prime; but with 
<A NAME="554"></A>regard to the seasons of the year, the litter is the best that comes at 
<A NAME="555"></A>the beginning of winter; and the summer litter the poorest, consisting 
<A NAME="556"></A>as it usually does of animals small and thin and flaccid. The boar, if 
<A NAME="557"></A>it be well fed, is sexually capable at all hours, night and day; but otherwise 
<A NAME="558"></A>is peculiarly salacious early in the morning. As it grows old the sexual 
<A NAME="559"></A>passion dies away, as we have already remarked. Very often a boar, when 
<A NAME="560"></A>more or less impotent from age or debility, finding itself unable to accomplish 
<A NAME="561"></A>the sexual commerce with due speed, and growing fatigued with the standing 
<A NAME="562"></A>posture, will roll the sow over on the ground, and the pair will conclude 
<A NAME="563"></A>the operation side by side of one another. The sow is sure of conception 
<A NAME="564"></A>if it drops its lugs in rutting time; if the ears do not thus drop, it 
<A NAME="565"></A>may have to rut a second time before impregnation takes 
<A NAME="566"></A>place.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR>Bitches do not submit to the male throughout their lives, but only 
<A NAME="568"></A>until they reach a certain maturity of years. As a general rule, they are 
<A NAME="569"></A>sexually receptive and conceptive until they are twelve years old; although, 
<A NAME="570"></A>by the way, cases have been known where dogs and bitches have been respectively 
<A NAME="571"></A>procreative and conceptive to the ages of eighteen and even of twenty years. 
<A NAME="572"></A>But, as a rule, age diminishes the capability of generation and of conception 
<A NAME="573"></A>with these animals as with all others.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>The female of the camel is opisthuretic, and submits to the male 
<A NAME="575"></A>in the way above described; and the season for copulation in Arabia is 
<A NAME="576"></A>about the month of October. Its period of gestation is twelve months; and 
<A NAME="577"></A>it is never delivered of more than one foal at a time. The female becomes 
<A NAME="578"></A>sexually receptive and the male sexually capable at the age of three years. 
<A NAME="579"></A>After parturition, an interval of a year elapses before the female is again 
<A NAME="580"></A>receptive to the male.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR>The female elephant becomes sexually receptive when ten years old 
<A NAME="582"></A>at the youngest, and when fifteen at the oldest; and the male is sexually 
<A NAME="583"></A>capable when five years old, or six. The season for intercourse is spring. 
<A NAME="584"></A>The male allows an interval of three years to elapse after commerce with 
<A NAME="585"></A>a female: and, after it has once impregnated a female, it has no intercourse 
<A NAME="586"></A>with her again. The period of gestation with the female is two years; and 
<A NAME="587"></A>only one young animal is produced at a time, in other words it is uniparous. 
<A NAME="588"></A>And the embryo is the size of a calf two or three months 
<A NAME="589"></A>old.

<A NAME="590"></A><B>Part 15</B>

<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR>So much for the copulations of such animals as 
<A NAME="592"></A>copulate.
<A NAME="593"></A><BR>We now proceed to treat of generation both with respect to copulating 
<A NAME="594"></A>and non-copulating animals, and we shall commence with discussing the subject 
<A NAME="595"></A>of generation in the case of the testaceans.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>The testacean is almost the only genus that throughout all its 
<A NAME="597"></A>species is non-copulative.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>The porphyrae, or purple murices, gather together to some one place 
<A NAME="599"></A>in the spring-time, and deposit the so-called 'honeycomb'. This substance 
<A NAME="600"></A>resembles the comb, only that it is not so neat and delicate; and looks 
<A NAME="601"></A>as though a number of husks of white chick-peas were all stuck together. 
<A NAME="602"></A>But none of these structures has any open passage, and the porphyra does 
<A NAME="603"></A>not grow out of them, but these and all other testaceans grow out of mud 
<A NAME="604"></A>and decaying matter. The substance, is, in fact, an excretion of the porphyra 
<A NAME="605"></A>and the ceryx; for it is deposited by the ceryx as well. Such, then, of 
<A NAME="606"></A>the testaceans as deposit the honeycomb are generated spontaneously like 
<A NAME="607"></A>all other testaceans, but they certainly come in greater abundance in places 
<A NAME="608"></A>where their congeners have been living previously. At the commencement 
<A NAME="609"></A>of the process of depositing the honeycomb, they throw off a slippery mucus, 
<A NAME="610"></A>and of this the husklike formations are composed. These formations, then, 
<A NAME="611"></A>all melt and deposit their contents on the ground, and at this spot there 
<A NAME="612"></A>are found on the ground a number of minute porphyrae, and porphyrae are 
<A NAME="613"></A>caught at times with these animalculae upon them, some of which are too 
<A NAME="614"></A>small to be differentiated in form. If the porphyrae are caught before 
<A NAME="615"></A>producing this honey-comb, they sometimes go through the process in fishing-creels, 
<A NAME="616"></A>not here and there in the baskets, but gathering to some one spot all together, 
<A NAME="617"></A>just as they do in the sea; and owing to the narrowness of their new quarters 
<A NAME="618"></A>they cluster together like a bunch of grapes.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>There are many species of the purple murex; and some are large, 
<A NAME="620"></A>as those found off Sigeum and Lectum; others are small, as those found 
<A NAME="621"></A>in the Euripus, and on the coast of Caria. And those that are found in 
<A NAME="622"></A>bays are large and rough; in most of them the peculiar bloom from which 
<A NAME="623"></A>their name is derived is dark to blackness, in others it is reddish and 
<A NAME="624"></A>small in size; some of the large ones weigh upwards of a mina apiece. But 
<A NAME="625"></A>the specimens that are found along the coast and on the rocks are small-sized, 
<A NAME="626"></A>and the bloom in their case is of a reddish hue. Further, as a general 
<A NAME="627"></A>rule, in northern waters the bloom is blackish, and in southern waters 
<A NAME="628"></A>of a reddish hue. The murex is caught in the spring-time when engaged in 
<A NAME="629"></A>the construction of the honeycomb; but it is not caught at any time about 
<A NAME="630"></A>the rising of the dog-star, for at that period it does not feed, but conceals 
<A NAME="631"></A>itself and burrows. The bloom of the animal is situated between the mecon 
<A NAME="632"></A>(or quasi-liver) and the neck, and the co-attachment of these is an intimate 
<A NAME="633"></A>one. In colour it looks like a white membrane, and this is what people 
<A NAME="634"></A>extract; and if it be removed and squeezed it stains your hand with the 
<A NAME="635"></A>colour of the bloom. There is a kind of vein that runs through it, and 
<A NAME="636"></A>this quasi-vein would appear to be in itself the bloom. And the qualities, 
<A NAME="637"></A>by the way, of this organ are astringent. It is after the murex has constructed 
<A NAME="638"></A>the honeycomb that the bloom is at its worst. Small specimens they break 
<A NAME="639"></A>in pieces, shells and all, for it is no easy matter to extract the organ; 
<A NAME="640"></A>but in dealing with the larger ones they first strip off the shell and 
<A NAME="641"></A>then abstract the bloom. For this purpose the neck and mecon are separated, 
<A NAME="642"></A>for the bloom lies in between them, above the so-called stomach; hence 
<A NAME="643"></A>the necessity of separating them in abstracting the bloom. Fishermen are 
<A NAME="644"></A>anxious always to break the animal in pieces while it is yet alive, for, 
<A NAME="645"></A>if it die before the process is completed, it vomits out the bloom; and 
<A NAME="646"></A>for this reason the fishermen keep the animals in creels, until they have 
<A NAME="647"></A>collected a sufficient number and can attend to them at their leisure. 
<A NAME="648"></A>Fishermen in past times used not to lower creels or attach them to the 
<A NAME="649"></A>bait, so that very often the animal got dropped off in the pulling up; 
<A NAME="650"></A>at present, however, they always attach a basket, so that if the animal 
<A NAME="651"></A>fall off it is not lost. The animal is more inclined to slip off the bait 
<A NAME="652"></A>if it be full inside; if it be empty it is difficult to shake it off. Such 
<A NAME="653"></A>are the phenomena connected with the porphyra or murex.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>The same phenomena are manifested by the ceryx or trumpet-shell; 
<A NAME="655"></A>and the seasons are the same in which the phenomena are observable. Both 
<A NAME="656"></A>animals, also, the murex and the ceryx, have their opercula similarly situated-and, 
<A NAME="657"></A>in fact, all the stromboids, and this is congenital with them all; and 
<A NAME="658"></A>they feed by protruding the so-called tongue underneath the operculum. 
<A NAME="659"></A>The tongue of the murex is bigger than one's finger, and by means of it, 
<A NAME="660"></A>it feeds, and perforates conchylia and the shells of its own kind. Both 
<A NAME="661"></A>the murex and the ceryx are long lived. The murex lives for about six years; 
<A NAME="662"></A>and the yearly increase is indicated by a distinct interval in the spiral 
<A NAME="663"></A>convolution of the shell.
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>The mussel also constructs a honeycomb.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR>With regard to the limnostreae, or lagoon oysters, wherever you have 
<A NAME="666"></A>slimy mud there you are sure to find them beginning to grow. Cockles and 
<A NAME="667"></A>clams and razor-fishes and scallops row spontaneously in sandy places. 
<A NAME="668"></A>The pinna grows straight up from its tuft of anchoring fibres in sandy 
<A NAME="669"></A>and slimy places; these creatures have inside them a parasite nicknamed 
<A NAME="670"></A>the pinna-guard, in some cases a small carid and in other cases a little 
<A NAME="671"></A>crab; if the pinna be deprived of this pinna-guard it soon 
<A NAME="672"></A>dies.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR>As a general rule, then, all testaceans grow by spontaneous generation 
<A NAME="674"></A>in mud, differing from one another according to the differences of the 
<A NAME="675"></A>material; oysters growing in slime, and cockles and the other testaceans 
<A NAME="676"></A>above mentioned on sandy bottoms; and in the hollows of the rocks the ascidian 
<A NAME="677"></A>and the barnacle, and common sorts, such as the limpet and the nerites. 
<A NAME="678"></A>All these animals grow with great rapidity, especially the murex and the 
<A NAME="679"></A>scallop; for the murex and the scallop attain their full growth in a year. 
<A NAME="680"></A>In some of the testaceans white crabs are found, very diminutive in size; 
<A NAME="681"></A>they are most numerous in the trough shaped mussel. In the pinna also is 
<A NAME="682"></A>found the so-called pinna-guard. They are found also in the scallop and 
<A NAME="683"></A>in the oyster; these parasites never appear to grow in size. Fishermen 
<A NAME="684"></A>declare that the parasite is congenital with the larger animal. (Scallops 
<A NAME="685"></A>burrow for a time in the sand, like the murex.)
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR>(Shell-fish, then, grow in the way above mentioned; and some of 
<A NAME="687"></A>them grow in shallow water, some on the sea-shore, some in rocky places, 
<A NAME="688"></A>some on hard and stony ground, and some in sandy places.) Some shift about 
<A NAME="689"></A>from place to place, others remain permanent on one spot. Of those that 
<A NAME="690"></A>keep to one spot the pinnae are rooted to the ground; the razor-fish and 
<A NAME="691"></A>the clam keep to the same locality, but are not so rooted; but still, if 
<A NAME="692"></A>forcibly removed they die.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR><BR>(The star-fish is naturally so warm that whatever it lays hold 
<A NAME="694"></A>of is found, when suddenly taken away from the animal, to have undergone 
<A NAME="695"></A>a process like boiling. Fishermen say that the star-fish is a great pest 
<A NAME="696"></A>in the Strait of Pyrrha. In shape it resembles a star as seen in an ordinary 
<A NAME="697"></A>drawing. The so-called 'lungs' are generated spontaneously. The shells 
<A NAME="698"></A>that painters use are a good deal thicker, and the bloom is outside the 
<A NAME="699"></A>shell on the surface. These creatures are mostly found on the coast of 
<A NAME="700"></A>Caria.)
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR>The hermit-crab grows spontaneously out of soil and slime, and 
<A NAME="702"></A>finds its way into untenanted shells. As it grows it shifts to a larger 
<A NAME="703"></A>shell, as for instance into the shell of the nerites, or of the strombus 
<A NAME="704"></A>or the like, and very often into the shell of the small ceryx. After entering 
<A NAME="705"></A>new shell, it carries it about, and begins again to feed, and, by and by, 
<A NAME="706"></A>as it grows, it shifts again into another larger one.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="707"></A><B>Part 16</B>

<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, the animals that are unfurnished with shells grow spontaneously, 
<A NAME="709"></A>like the testaceans, as, for instance, the sea-nettles and the sponges 
<A NAME="710"></A>in rocky caves.
<A NAME="711"></A><BR><BR>Of the sea-nettle, or sea-anemone, there are two species; and of 
<A NAME="712"></A>these one species lives in hollows and never loosens its hold upon the 
<A NAME="713"></A>rocks, and the other lives on smooth flat reefs, free and detached, and 
<A NAME="714"></A>shifts its position from time to time. (Limpets also detach themselves, 
<A NAME="715"></A>and shift from place to place.)
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR>In the chambered cavities of sponges pinna-guards or parasites 
<A NAME="717"></A>are found. And over the chambers there is a kind of spider's web, by the 
<A NAME="718"></A>opening and closing of which they catch mute fishes; that is to say, they 
<A NAME="719"></A>open the web to let the fish get in, and close it again to entrap 
<A NAME="720"></A>them.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR>Of sponges there are three species; the first is of loose porous 
<A NAME="722"></A>texture, the second is close textured, the third, which is nicknamed 'the 
<A NAME="723"></A>sponge of Achilles', is exceptionally fine and close-textured and strong. 
<A NAME="724"></A>This sponge is used as a lining to helmets and greaves, for the purpose 
<A NAME="725"></A>of deadening the sound of the blow; and this is a very scarce species. 
<A NAME="726"></A>Of the close textured sponges such as are particularly hard and rough are 
<A NAME="727"></A>nicknamed 'goats'.
<A NAME="728"></A><BR><BR>Sponges grow spontaneously either attached to a rock or on sea-beaches, 
<A NAME="729"></A>and they get their nutriment in slime: a proof of this statement is the 
<A NAME="730"></A>fact that when they are first secured they are found to be full of slime. 
<A NAME="731"></A>This is characteristic of all living creatures that get their nutriment 
<A NAME="732"></A>by close local attachment. And, by the way, the close-textured sponges 
<A NAME="733"></A>are weaker than the more openly porous ones because their attachment extends 
<A NAME="734"></A>over a smaller area.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR><BR>It is said that the sponge is sensitive; and as a proof of this 
<A NAME="736"></A>statement they say that if the sponge is made aware of an attempt being 
<A NAME="737"></A>made to pluck it from its place of attachment it draws itself together, 
<A NAME="738"></A>and it becomes a difficult task to detach it. It makes a similar contractile 
<A NAME="739"></A>movement in windy and boisterous weather, obviously with the object of 
<A NAME="740"></A>tightening its hold. Some persons express doubts as to the truth of this 
<A NAME="741"></A>assertion; as, for instance, the people of Torone.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR>The sponge breeds parasites, worms, and other creatures, on which, 
<A NAME="743"></A>if they be detached, the rock-fishes prey, as they prey also on the remaining 
<A NAME="744"></A>stumps of the sponge; but, if the sponge be broken off, it grows again 
<A NAME="745"></A>from the remaining stump and the place is soon as well covered as 
<A NAME="746"></A>before.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>The largest of all sponges are the loose-textured ones, and these 
<A NAME="748"></A>are peculiarly abundant on the coast of Lycia. The softest are the close-textured 
<A NAME="749"></A>sponges; for, by the way, the so-called sponges of Achilles are harder 
<A NAME="750"></A>than these. As a general rule, sponges that are found in deep calm waters 
<A NAME="751"></A>are the softest; for usually windy and stormy weather has a tendency to 
<A NAME="752"></A>harden them (as it has to harden all similar growing things), and to arrest 
<A NAME="753"></A>their growth. And this accounts for the fact that the sponges found in 
<A NAME="754"></A>the Hellespont are rough and close-textured; and, as a general rule, sponges 
<A NAME="755"></A>found beyond or inside Cape Malea are, respectively, comparatively soft 
<A NAME="756"></A>or comparatively hard. But, by the way, the habitat of the sponge should 
<A NAME="757"></A>not be too sheltered and warm, for it has a tendency to decay, like all 
<A NAME="758"></A>similar vegetable-like growths. And this accounts for the fact that the 
<A NAME="759"></A>sponge is at its best when found in deep water close to shore; for owing 
<A NAME="760"></A>to the depth of the water they enjoy shelter alike from stormy winds and 
<A NAME="761"></A>from excessive heat.
<A NAME="762"></A><BR><BR>Whilst they are still alive and before they are washed and cleaned, 
<A NAME="763"></A>they are blackish in colour. Their attachment is not made at one particular 
<A NAME="764"></A>spot, nor is it made all over their bodies; for vacant pore-spaces intervene. 
<A NAME="765"></A>There is a kind of membrane stretched over the under parts; and in the 
<A NAME="766"></A>under parts the points of attachment are the more numerous. On the top 
<A NAME="767"></A>most of the pores are closed, but four or five are open and visible; and 
<A NAME="768"></A>we are told by some that it is through these pores that the animal takes 
<A NAME="769"></A>its food.
<A NAME="770"></A><BR><BR>There is a particular species that is named the 'aplysia' or the 
<A NAME="771"></A>'unwashable', from the circumstance that it cannot be cleaned. This species 
<A NAME="772"></A>has the large open and visible pores, but all the rest of the body is close-textured; 
<A NAME="773"></A>and, if it be dissected, it is found to be closer and more glutinous than 
<A NAME="774"></A>the ordinary sponge, and, in a word, something lung like in consistency. 
<A NAME="775"></A>And, on all hands, it is allowed that this species is sensitive and long-lived. 
<A NAME="776"></A>They are distinguished in the sea from ordinary sponges from the circumstance 
<A NAME="777"></A>that the ordinary sponges are white while the slime is in them, but that 
<A NAME="778"></A>these sponges are under any circumstances black.
<A NAME="779"></A><BR><BR>And so much with regard to sponges and to generation in the 
<A NAME="780"></A>testaceans.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="781"></A><B>Part 17</B>

<A NAME="782"></A><BR><BR>Of crustaceans, the female crawfish after copulation conceives 
<A NAME="783"></A>and retains its eggs for about three months, from about the middle of May 
<A NAME="784"></A>to about the middle of August; they then lay the eggs into the folds underneath 
<A NAME="785"></A>the belly, and their eggs grow like grubs. This same phenomenon is observable 
<A NAME="786"></A>in molluscs also, and in such fishes as are oviparous; for in all these 
<A NAME="787"></A>cases the egg continues to grow.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR>The spawn of the crawfish is of a loose or granular consistency, 
<A NAME="789"></A>and is divided into eight parts; for corresponding to each of the flaps 
<A NAME="790"></A>on the side there is a gristly formation to which the spawn is attached, 
<A NAME="791"></A>and the entire structure resembles a cluster of grapes; for each gristly 
<A NAME="792"></A>formation is split into several parts. This is obvious enough if you draw 
<A NAME="793"></A>the parts asunder; but at first sight the whole appears to be one and indivisible. 
<A NAME="794"></A>And the largest are not those nearest to the outlet but those in the middle, 
<A NAME="795"></A>and the farthest off are the smallest. The size of the small eggs is that 
<A NAME="796"></A>of a small seed in a fig; and they are not quite close to the outlet, but 
<A NAME="797"></A>placed middleways; for at both ends, tailwards and trunkwards, there are 
<A NAME="798"></A>two intervals devoid of eggs; for it is thus that the flaps also grow. 
<A NAME="799"></A>The side flaps, then, cannot close, but by placing the end flap on them 
<A NAME="800"></A>the animal can close up all, and this end-flap serves them for a lid. And 
<A NAME="801"></A>in the act of laying its eggs it seems to bring them towards the gristly 
<A NAME="802"></A>formations by curving the flap of its tail, and then, squeezing the eggs 
<A NAME="803"></A>towards the said gristly formations and maintaining a bent posture, it 
<A NAME="804"></A>performs the act of laying. The gristly formations at these seasons increase 
<A NAME="805"></A>in size and become receptive of the eggs; for the animal lays its eggs 
<A NAME="806"></A>into these formations, just as the sepia lays its eggs among twigs and 
<A NAME="807"></A>driftwood.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR>It lays its eggs, then, in this manner, and after hatching them 
<A NAME="809"></A>for about twenty days it rids itself of them all in one solid lump, as 
<A NAME="810"></A>is quite plain from outside. And out of these eggs crawfish form in about 
<A NAME="811"></A>fifteen days, and these crawfish are caught at times less then a finger's 
<A NAME="812"></A>breadth, or seven-tenths of an inch, in length. The animal, then, lays 
<A NAME="813"></A>its eggs before the middle of September, and after the middle of that month 
<A NAME="814"></A>throws off its eggs in a lump. With the humped carids or prawns the time 
<A NAME="815"></A>for gestation is four months or thereabouts.
<A NAME="816"></A><BR><BR>Crawfish are found in rough and rocky places, lobsters in smooth 
<A NAME="817"></A>places, and neither crawfish nor lobsters are found in muddy ones; and 
<A NAME="818"></A>this accounts for the fact that lobsters are found in the Hellespont and 
<A NAME="819"></A>on the coast of Thasos, and crawfish in the neighbourhood of Sigeum and 
<A NAME="820"></A>Mount Athos. Fishermen, accordingly, when they want to catch these various 
<A NAME="821"></A>creatures out at sea, take bearings on the beach and elsewhere that tell 
<A NAME="822"></A>them where the ground at the bottom is stony and where soft with slime. 
<A NAME="823"></A>In winter and spring these animals keep in near to land, in summer they 
<A NAME="824"></A>keep in deep water; thus at various times seeking respectively for warmth 
<A NAME="825"></A>or coolness.
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR>The so-called arctus or bear-crab lays its eggs at about the same 
<A NAME="827"></A>time as the crawfish; and consequently in winter and in the spring-time, 
<A NAME="828"></A>before laying their eggs, they are at their best, and after laying at their 
<A NAME="829"></A>worst.
<A NAME="830"></A><BR><BR>They cast their shell in the spring-time (just as serpents shed 
<A NAME="831"></A>their so-called 'old-age' or slough), both directly after birth and in 
<A NAME="832"></A>later life; this is true both of crabs and crawfish. And, by the way, all 
<A NAME="833"></A>crawfish are long lived.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="834"></A><B>Part 18</B>

<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>Molluscs, after pairing and copulation, lay a white spawn; and 
<A NAME="836"></A>this spawn, as in the case of the testacean, gets granular in time. The 
<A NAME="837"></A>octopus discharges into its hole, or into a potsherd or into any similar 
<A NAME="838"></A>cavity, a structure resembling the tendrils of a young vine or the fruit 
<A NAME="839"></A>of the white poplar, as has been previously observed. The eggs, when the 
<A NAME="840"></A>female has laid them, are clustered round the sides of the hole. They are 
<A NAME="841"></A>so numerous that, if they be removed they suffice to fill a vessel much 
<A NAME="842"></A>larger than the animal's body in which they were contained. Some fifty 
<A NAME="843"></A>days later, the eggs burst and the little polypuses creep out, like little 
<A NAME="844"></A>spiders, in great numbers; the characteristic form of their limbs is not 
<A NAME="845"></A>yet to be discerned in detail, but their general outline is clear enough. 
<A NAME="846"></A>And, by the way, they are so small and helpless that the greater number 
<A NAME="847"></A>perish; it is a fact that they have been seen so extremely minute as to 
<A NAME="848"></A>be absolutely without organization, but nevertheless when touched they 
<A NAME="849"></A>moved. The eggs of the sepia look like big black myrtle-berries, and they 
<A NAME="850"></A>are linked all together like a bunch of grapes, clustered round a centre, 
<A NAME="851"></A>and are not easily sundered from one another: for the male exudes over 
<A NAME="852"></A>them some moist glairy stuff, which constitutes the sticky gum. These eggs 
<A NAME="853"></A>increase in size; and they are white at the outset, but black and larger 
<A NAME="854"></A>after the sprinkling of the male seminal fluid.
<A NAME="855"></A><BR><BR>When it has come into being the young sepia is first distinctly 
<A NAME="856"></A>formed inside out of the white substance, and when the egg bursts it comes 
<A NAME="857"></A>out. The inner part is formed as soon as the female lays the egg, something 
<A NAME="858"></A>like a hail-stone; and out of this substance the young sepia grows by a 
<A NAME="859"></A>head-attachment, just as young birds grow by a belly-attachment. What is 
<A NAME="860"></A>the exact nature of the navel-attachment has not yet been observed, except 
<A NAME="861"></A>that as the young sepia grows the white substance grows less and less in 
<A NAME="862"></A>size, and at length, as happens with the yolk in the case of birds, the 
<A NAME="863"></A>white substance in the case of the young sepia disappears. In the case 
<A NAME="864"></A>of the young sepia, as in the case of the young of most animals, the eyes 
<A NAME="865"></A>at first seem very large. To illustrate this by way of a figure, let A 
<A NAME="866"></A>represent the ovum, B and C the eyes, and D the sepidium, or body of the 
<A NAME="867"></A>little sepia. (See diagram.)
<A NAME="868"></A><BR><BR>The female sepia goes pregnant in the spring-time, and lays its 
<A NAME="869"></A>eggs after fifteen days of gestation; after the eggs are laid there comes 
<A NAME="870"></A>in another fifteen days something like a bunch of grapes, and at the bursting 
<A NAME="871"></A>of these the young sepiae issue forth. But if, when the young ones are 
<A NAME="872"></A>fully formed, you sever the outer covering a moment too soon, the young 
<A NAME="873"></A>creatures eject excrement, and their colour changes from white to red in 
<A NAME="874"></A>their alarm.
<A NAME="875"></A><BR><BR>Crustaceans, then, hatch their eggs by brooding over them as they 
<A NAME="876"></A>carry them about beneath their bodies; but the octopus, the sepia, and 
<A NAME="877"></A>the like hatch their eggs without stirring from the spot where they may 
<A NAME="878"></A>have laid them, and this statement is particularly applicable to the sepia; 
<A NAME="879"></A>in fact, the nest of the female sepia is often seen exposed to view close 
<A NAME="880"></A>in to shore. The female octopus at times sits brooding over her eggs, and 
<A NAME="881"></A>at other times squats in front of her hole, stretching out her tentacles 
<A NAME="882"></A>on guard.
<A NAME="883"></A><BR><BR>The sepia lays her spawn near to land in the neighbourhood of sea-weed 
<A NAME="884"></A>or reeds or any off-sweepings such as brushwood, twigs, or stones; and 
<A NAME="885"></A>fishermen place heaps of faggots here and there on purpose, and on to such 
<A NAME="886"></A>heaps the female deposits a long continuous roe in shape like a vine tendril. 
<A NAME="887"></A>It lays or spirts out the spawn with an effort, as though there were difficulty 
<A NAME="888"></A>in the process. The female calamary spawns at sea; and it emits the spawn, 
<A NAME="889"></A>as does the sepia, in the mass.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR>The calamary and the cuttle-fish are short-lived, as, with few 
<A NAME="891"></A>exceptions, they never see the year out; and the same statement is applicable 
<A NAME="892"></A>to the octopus.
<A NAME="893"></A><BR><BR>From one single egg comes one single sepia; and this is likewise 
<A NAME="894"></A>true of the young calamary.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR>The male calamary differs from the female; for if its gill-region 
<A NAME="896"></A>be dilated and examined there are found two red formations resembling breasts, 
<A NAME="897"></A>with which the male is unprovided. In the sepia, apart from this distinction 
<A NAME="898"></A>in the sexes, the male, as has been stated, is more mottled than the 
<A NAME="899"></A>female.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="900"></A><B>Part 19</B>

<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR>With regard to insects, that the male is less than the female and 
<A NAME="902"></A>that he mounts upon her back, and how he performs the act of copulation 
<A NAME="903"></A>and the circumstance that he gives over reluctantly, all this has already 
<A NAME="904"></A>been set forth, most cases of insect copulation this process is speedily 
<A NAME="905"></A>followed up by parturition.
<A NAME="906"></A><BR><BR>All insects engender grubs, with the exception of a species of 
<A NAME="907"></A>butterfly; and the female of this species lays a hard egg, resembling the 
<A NAME="908"></A>seed of the cnecus, with a juice inside it. But from the grub, the young 
<A NAME="909"></A>animal does not grow out of a mere portion of it, as a young animal grows 
<A NAME="910"></A>from a portion only of an egg, but the grub entire grows and the animal 
<A NAME="911"></A>becomes differentiated out of it.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR>And of insects some are derived from insect congeners, as the venom-spider 
<A NAME="913"></A>and the common-spider from the venom-spider and the common-spider, and 
<A NAME="914"></A>so with the attelabus or locust, the acris or grasshopper, and the tettix 
<A NAME="915"></A>or cicada. Other insects are not derived from living parentage, but are 
<A NAME="916"></A>generated spontaneously: some out of dew falling on leaves, ordinarily 
<A NAME="917"></A>in spring-time, but not seldom in winter when there has been a stretch 
<A NAME="918"></A>of fair weather and southerly winds; others grow in decaying mud or dung; 
<A NAME="919"></A>others in timber, green or dry; some in the hair of animals; some in the 
<A NAME="920"></A>flesh of animals; some in excrements: and some from excrement after it 
<A NAME="921"></A>has been voided, and some from excrement yet within the living animal, 
<A NAME="922"></A>like the helminthes or intestinal worms. And of these intestinal worms 
<A NAME="923"></A>there are three species: one named the flat-worm, another the round worm, 
<A NAME="924"></A>and the third the ascarid. These intestinal worms do not in any case propagate 
<A NAME="925"></A>their kind. The flat-worm, however, in an exceptional way, clings fast 
<A NAME="926"></A>to the gut, and lays a thing like a melon-seed, by observing which indication 
<A NAME="927"></A>the physician concludes that his patient is troubled with the 
<A NAME="928"></A>worm.
<A NAME="929"></A><BR><BR>The so-called psyche or butterfly is generated from caterpillars 
<A NAME="930"></A>which grow on green leaves, chiefly leaves of the raphanus, which some 
<A NAME="931"></A>call crambe or cabbage. At first it is less than a grain of millet; it 
<A NAME="932"></A>then grows into a small grub; and in three days it is a tiny caterpillar. 
<A NAME="933"></A>After this it grows on and on, and becomes quiescent and changes its shape, 
<A NAME="934"></A>and is now called a chrysalis. The outer shell is hard, and the chrysalis 
<A NAME="935"></A>moves if you touch it. It attaches itself by cobweb-like filaments, and 
<A NAME="936"></A>is unfurnished with mouth or any other apparent organ. After a little while 
<A NAME="937"></A>the outer covering bursts asunder, and out flies the winged creature that 
<A NAME="938"></A>we call the psyche or butterfly. At first, when it is a caterpillar, it 
<A NAME="939"></A>feeds and ejects excrement; but when it turns into the chrysalis it neither 
<A NAME="940"></A>feeds nor ejects excrement.
<A NAME="941"></A><BR><BR>The same remarks are applicable to all such insects as are developed 
<A NAME="942"></A>out of the grub, both such grubs as are derived from the copulation of 
<A NAME="943"></A>living animals and such as are generated without copulation on the part 
<A NAME="944"></A>of parents. For the grub of the bee, the anthrena, and the wasp, whilst 
<A NAME="945"></A>it is young, takes food and voids excrement; but when it has passed from 
<A NAME="946"></A>the grub shape to its defined form and become what is termed a 'nympha', 
<A NAME="947"></A>it ceases to take food and to void excrement, and remains tightly wrapped 
<A NAME="948"></A>up and motionless until it has reached its full size, when it breaks the 
<A NAME="949"></A>formation with which the cell is closed, and issues forth. The insects 
<A NAME="950"></A>named the hypera and the penia are derived from similar caterpillars, which 
<A NAME="951"></A>move in an undulatory way, progressing with one part and then pulling up 
<A NAME="952"></A>the hinder parts by a bend of the body. The developed insect in each case 
<A NAME="953"></A>takes its peculiar colour from the parent caterpillar.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR><BR>From one particular large grub, which has as it were horns, and 
<A NAME="955"></A>in other respects differs from grubs in general, there comes, by a metamorphosis 
<A NAME="956"></A>of the grub, first a caterpillar, then the cocoon, then the necydalus; 
<A NAME="957"></A>and the creature passes through all these transformations within six months. 
<A NAME="958"></A>A class of women unwind and reel off the cocoons of these creatures, and 
<A NAME="959"></A>afterwards weave a fabric with the threads thus unwound; a Coan woman of 
<A NAME="960"></A>the name of Pamphila, daughter of Plateus, being credited with the first 
<A NAME="961"></A>invention of the fabric. After the same fashion the carabus or stag-beetle 
<A NAME="962"></A>comes from grubs that live in dry wood: at first the grub is motionless, 
<A NAME="963"></A>but after a while the shell bursts and the stag-beetle issues 
<A NAME="964"></A>forth.
<A NAME="965"></A><BR><BR>From the cabbage is engendered the cabbageworm, and from the leek 
<A NAME="966"></A>the prasocuris or leekbane; this creature is also winged. From the flat 
<A NAME="967"></A>animalcule that skims over the surface of rivers comes the oestrus or gadfly; 
<A NAME="968"></A>and this accounts for the fact that gadflies most abound in the neighbourhood 
<A NAME="969"></A>of waters on whose surface these animalcules are observed. From a certain 
<A NAME="970"></A>small, black and hairy caterpillar comes first a wingless glow-worm; and 
<A NAME="971"></A>this creature again suffers a metamorphosis, and transforms into a winged 
<A NAME="972"></A>insect named the bostrychus (or hair-curl).
<A NAME="973"></A><BR><BR>Gnats grow from ascarids; and ascarids are engendered in the slime 
<A NAME="974"></A>of wells, or in places where there is a deposit left by the draining off 
<A NAME="975"></A>of water. This slime decays, and first turns white, then black, and finally 
<A NAME="976"></A>blood-red; and at this stage there originate in it, as it were, little 
<A NAME="977"></A>tiny bits of red weed, which at first wriggle about all clinging together, 
<A NAME="978"></A>and finally break loose and swim in the water, and are hereupon known as 
<A NAME="979"></A>ascarids. After a few days they stand straight up on the water motionless 
<A NAME="980"></A>and hard, and by and by the husk breaks off and the gnats are seen sitting 
<A NAME="981"></A>upon it, until the sun's heat or a puff of wind sets them in motion, when 
<A NAME="982"></A>they fly away.
<A NAME="983"></A><BR><BR>With all grubs and all animals that break out from the grub state, 
<A NAME="984"></A>generation is due primarily to the heat of the sun or to 
<A NAME="985"></A>wind.
<A NAME="986"></A><BR><BR>Ascarids are more likely to be found, and grow with unusual rapidity, 
<A NAME="987"></A>in places where there is a deposit of a mixed and heterogeneous kind, as 
<A NAME="988"></A>in kitchens and in ploughed fields, for the contents of such places are 
<A NAME="989"></A>disposed to rapid putrefaction. In autumn, also, owing to the drying up 
<A NAME="990"></A>of moisture, they grow in unusual numbers.
<A NAME="991"></A><BR><BR>The tick is generated from couch-grass. The cockchafer comes from 
<A NAME="992"></A>a grub that is generated in the dung of the cow or the ass. The cantharus 
<A NAME="993"></A>or scarabeus rolls a piece of dung into a ball, lies hidden within it during 
<A NAME="994"></A>the winter, and gives birth therein to small grubs, from which grubs come 
<A NAME="995"></A>new canthari. Certain winged insects also come from the grubs that are 
<A NAME="996"></A>found in pulse, in the same fashion as in the cases 
<A NAME="997"></A>described.
<A NAME="998"></A><BR><BR>Flies grow from grubs in the dung that farmers have gathered up 
<A NAME="999"></A>into heaps: for those who are engaged in this work assiduously gather up 
<A NAME="1000"></A>the compost, and this they technically term 'working-up' the manure. The 
<A NAME="1001"></A>grub is exceedingly minute to begin with; first even at this stage-it assumes 
<A NAME="1002"></A>a reddish colour, and then from a quiescent state it takes on the power 
<A NAME="1003"></A>of motion, as though born to it; it then becomes a small motionless grub; 
<A NAME="1004"></A>it then moves again, and again relapses into immobility; it then comes 
<A NAME="1005"></A>out a perfect fly, and moves away under the influence of the sun's heat 
<A NAME="1006"></A>or of a puff of air. The myops or horse-fly is engendered in timber. The 
<A NAME="1007"></A>orsodacna or budbane is a transformed grub; and this grub is engendered 
<A NAME="1008"></A>in cabbage-stalks. The cantharis comes from the caterpillars that are found 
<A NAME="1009"></A>on fig-trees or pear-trees or fir-trees--for on all these grubs are engendered-and 
<A NAME="1010"></A>also from caterpillars found on the dog-rose; and the cantharis takes eagerly 
<A NAME="1011"></A>to ill-scented substances, from the fact of its having been engendered 
<A NAME="1012"></A>in ill-scented woods. The conops comes from a grub that is engendered in 
<A NAME="1013"></A>the slime of vinegar.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>And, by the way, living animals are found in substances that are 
<A NAME="1015"></A>usually supposed to be incapable of putrefaction; for instance, worms are 
<A NAME="1016"></A>found in long-lying snow; and snow of this description gets reddish in 
<A NAME="1017"></A>colour, and the grub that is engendered in it is red, as might have been 
<A NAME="1018"></A>expected, and it is also hairy. The grubs found in the snows of Media are 
<A NAME="1019"></A>large and white; and all such grubs are little disposed to motion. In Cyprus, 
<A NAME="1020"></A>in places where copper-ore is smelted, with heaps of the ore piled on day 
<A NAME="1021"></A>after day, an animal is engendered in the fire, somewhat larger than a 
<A NAME="1022"></A>blue bottle fly, furnished with wings, which can hop or crawl through the 
<A NAME="1023"></A>fire. And the grubs and these latter animals perish when you keep the one 
<A NAME="1024"></A>away from the fire and the other from the snow. Now the salamander is a 
<A NAME="1025"></A>clear case in point, to show us that animals do actually exist that fire 
<A NAME="1026"></A>cannot destroy; for this creature, so the story goes, not only walks through 
<A NAME="1027"></A>the fire but puts it out in doing so.
<A NAME="1028"></A><BR><BR>On the river Hypanis in the Cimmerian Bosphorus, about the time 
<A NAME="1029"></A>of the summer solstice, there are brought down towards the sea by the stream 
<A NAME="1030"></A>what look like little sacks rather bigger than grapes, out of which at 
<A NAME="1031"></A>their bursting issues a winged quadruped. The insect lives and flies about 
<A NAME="1032"></A>until the evening, but as the sun goes down it pines away, and dies at 
<A NAME="1033"></A>sunset having lived just one day, from which circumstance it is called 
<A NAME="1034"></A>the ephemeron.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR><BR>As a rule, insects that come from caterpillars and grubs are held 
<A NAME="1036"></A>at first by filaments resembling the threads of a spider's 
<A NAME="1037"></A>web.
<A NAME="1038"></A><BR><BR>Such is the mode of generation of the insects above enumerated. 
<A NAME="1039"></A>but if the latter impregnation takes placeduring the change of the 
<A NAME="1040"></A>yellow
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1041"></A><B>Part 20</B>

<A NAME="1042"></A><BR><BR>The wasps that are nicknamed 'the ichneumons' (or hunters), less 
<A NAME="1043"></A>in size, by the way, than the ordinary wasp, kill spiders and carry off 
<A NAME="1044"></A>the dead bodies to a wall or some such place with a hole in it; this hole 
<A NAME="1045"></A>they smear over with mud and lay their grubs inside it, and from the grubs 
<A NAME="1046"></A>come the hunter-wasps. Some of the coleoptera and of the small and nameless 
<A NAME="1047"></A>insects make small holes or cells of mud on a wall or on a grave-stone, 
<A NAME="1048"></A>and there deposit their grubs.
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR><BR>With insects, as a general rule, the time of generation from its 
<A NAME="1050"></A>commencement to its completion comprises three or four weeks. With grubs 
<A NAME="1051"></A>and grub-like creatures the time is usually three weeks, and in the oviparous 
<A NAME="1052"></A>insects as a rule four. But, in the case of oviparous insects, the egg-formation 
<A NAME="1053"></A>comes at the close of seven days from copulation, and during the remaining 
<A NAME="1054"></A>three weeks the parent broods over and hatches its young; i.e. where this 
<A NAME="1055"></A>is the result of copulation, as in the case of the spider and its congeners. 
<A NAME="1056"></A>As a rule, the transformations take place in intervals of three or four 
<A NAME="1057"></A>days, corresponding to the lengths of interval at which the crises recur 
<A NAME="1058"></A>in intermittent fevers.
<A NAME="1059"></A><BR><BR>So much for the generation of insects. Their death is due to the 
<A NAME="1060"></A>shrivelling of their organs, just as the larger animals die of old 
<A NAME="1061"></A>age.
<A NAME="1062"></A><BR><BR>Winged insects die in autumn from the shrinking of their wings. 
<A NAME="1063"></A>The myops dies from dropsy in the eyes.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1064"></A><B>Part 21</B>

<A NAME="1065"></A><BR><BR>With regard to the generation of bees different hypotheses are 
<A NAME="1066"></A>in vogue. Some affirm that bees neither copulate nor give birth to young, 
<A NAME="1067"></A>but that they fetch their young. And some say that they fetch their young 
<A NAME="1068"></A>from the flower of the callyntrum; others assert that they bring them from 
<A NAME="1069"></A>the flower of the reed, others, from the flower of the olive. And in respect 
<A NAME="1070"></A>to the olive theory, it is stated as a proof that, when the olive harvest 
<A NAME="1071"></A>is most abundant, the swarms are most numerous. Others declare that they 
<A NAME="1072"></A>fetch the brood of the drones from such things as above mentioned, but 
<A NAME="1073"></A>that the working bees are engendered by the rulers of the 
<A NAME="1074"></A>hive.
<A NAME="1075"></A><BR><BR>Now of these rulers there are two kinds: the better kind is red 
<A NAME="1076"></A>in colour, the inferior kind is black and variegated; the ruler is double 
<A NAME="1077"></A>the size of the working bee. These rulers have the abdomen or part below 
<A NAME="1078"></A>the waist half as large again, and they are called by some the 'mothers', 
<A NAME="1079"></A>from an idea that they bear or generate the bees; and, as a proof of this 
<A NAME="1080"></A>theory of their motherhood, they declare that the brood of the drones appears 
<A NAME="1081"></A>even when there is no ruler-bee in the hive, but that the bees do not appear 
<A NAME="1082"></A>in his absence. Others, again, assert that these insects copulate, and 
<A NAME="1083"></A>that the drones are male and the bees female.
<A NAME="1084"></A><BR><BR>The ordinary bee is generated in the cells of the comb, but the 
<A NAME="1085"></A>ruler-bees in cells down below attached to the comb, suspended from it, 
<A NAME="1086"></A>apart from the rest, six or seven in number, and growing in a way quite 
<A NAME="1087"></A>different from the mode of growth of the ordinary brood.
<A NAME="1088"></A><BR><BR>Bees are provided with a sting, but the drones are not so provided. 
<A NAME="1089"></A>The rulers are provided with stings, but they never use them; and this 
<A NAME="1090"></A>latter circumstance will account for the belief of some people that they 
<A NAME="1091"></A>have no stings at all.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1092"></A><B>Part 22</B>

<A NAME="1093"></A><BR><BR>Of bees there are various species. The best kind is a little round 
<A NAME="1094"></A>mottled insect; another is long, and resembles the anthrena; a third is 
<A NAME="1095"></A>a black and flat-bellied, and is nick-named the 'robber'; a fourth kind 
<A NAME="1096"></A>is the drone, the largest of all, but stingless and inactive. And this 
<A NAME="1097"></A>proportionate size of the drone explains why some bee-masters place a net-work

<A NAME="1099"></A>while it lets the little bees go in.
<A NAME="1100"></A><BR><BR>Of the king bees there are, as has been stated, two kinds. In every 
<A NAME="1101"></A>hive there are more kings than one; and a hive goes to ruin if there be 
<A NAME="1102"></A>too few kings, not because of anarchy thereby ensuing, but, as we are told, 
<A NAME="1103"></A>because these creatures contribute in some way to the generation of the 
<A NAME="1104"></A>common bees. A hive will go also to ruin if there be too large a number 
<A NAME="1105"></A>of kings in it; for the members of the hives are thereby subdivided into 
<A NAME="1106"></A>too many separate factions.
<A NAME="1107"></A><BR><BR>Whenever the spring-time is late a-coming, and when there is drought 
<A NAME="1108"></A>and mildew, then the progeny of the hive is small in number. But when the 
<A NAME="1109"></A>weather is dry they attend to the honey, and in rainy weather their attention 
<A NAME="1110"></A>is concentrated on the brood; and this will account for the coincidence 
<A NAME="1111"></A>of rich olive-harvests and abundant swarms.
<A NAME="1112"></A><BR><BR>The bees first work at the honeycomb, and then put the pupae in 
<A NAME="1113"></A>it: by the mouth, say those who hold the theory of their bringing them 
<A NAME="1114"></A>from elsewhere. After putting in the pupae they put in the honey for subsistence, 
<A NAME="1115"></A>and this they do in the summer and autumn; and, by the way, the autumn 
<A NAME="1116"></A>honey is the better of the two.
<A NAME="1117"></A><BR><BR>The honeycomb is made from flowers, and the materials for the wax 
<A NAME="1118"></A>they gather from the resinous gum of trees, while honey is distilled from 
<A NAME="1119"></A>dew, and is deposited chiefly at the risings of the constellations or when 
<A NAME="1120"></A>a rainbow is in the sky: and as a general rule there is no honey before 
<A NAME="1121"></A>the rising of the Pleiads. (The bee, then, makes the wax from flowers. 
<A NAME="1122"></A>The honey, however, it does not make, but merely gathers what is deposited 
<A NAME="1123"></A>out of the atmosphere; and as a proof of this statement we have the known 
<A NAME="1124"></A>fact that occasionally bee-keepers find the hives filled with honey within 
<A NAME="1125"></A>the space of two or three days. Furthermore, in autumn flowers are found, 
<A NAME="1126"></A>but honey, if it be withdrawn, is not replaced; now, after the withdra
