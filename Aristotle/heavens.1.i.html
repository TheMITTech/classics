<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>The science which has to do with nature clearly concerns itself for the 
<A NAME="12"></A>most part with bodies and magnitudes and their properties and movements, 
<A NAME="13"></A>but also with the principles of this sort of substance, as many as they 
<A NAME="14"></A>may be. For of things constituted by nature some are bodies and magnitudes, 
<A NAME="15"></A>some possess body and magnitude, and some are principles of things which 
<A NAME="16"></A>possess these. Now a continuum is that which is divisible into parts always 
<A NAME="17"></A>capable of subdivision, and a body is that which is every way divisible. 
<A NAME="18"></A>A magnitude if divisible one way is a line, if two ways a surface, and 
<A NAME="19"></A>if three a body. Beyond these there is no other magnitude, because the 
<A NAME="20"></A>three dimensions are all that there are, and that which is divisible in 
<A NAME="21"></A>three directions is divisible in all. For, as the Pythagoreans say, the 
<A NAME="22"></A>world and all that is in it is determined by the number three, since beginning 
<A NAME="23"></A>and middle and end give the number of an 'all', and the number they give 
<A NAME="24"></A>is the triad. And so, having taken these three from nature as (so to speak) 
<A NAME="25"></A>laws of it, we make further use of the number three in the worship of the 
<A NAME="26"></A>Gods. Further, we use the terms in practice in this way. Of two things, 
<A NAME="27"></A>or men, we say 'both', but not 'all': three is the first number to which 
<A NAME="28"></A>the term 'all' has been appropriated. And in this, as we have said, we 
<A NAME="29"></A>do but follow the lead which nature gives. Therefore, since 'every' and 
<A NAME="30"></A>'all' and 'complete' do not differ from one another in respect of form, 
<A NAME="31"></A>but only, if at all, in their matter and in that to which they are applied, 
<A NAME="32"></A>body alone among magnitudes can be complete. For it alone is determined 
<A NAME="33"></A>by the three dimensions, that is, is an 'all'. But if it is divisible in 
<A NAME="34"></A>three dimensions it is every way divisible, while the other magnitudes 
<A NAME="35"></A>are divisible in one dimension or in two alone: for the divisibility and 
<A NAME="36"></A>continuity of magnitudes depend upon the number of the dimensions, one 
<A NAME="37"></A>sort being continuous in one direction, another in two, another in all. 
<A NAME="38"></A>All magnitudes, then, which are divisible are also continuous. Whether 
<A NAME="39"></A>we can also say that whatever is continuous is divisible does not yet, 
<A NAME="40"></A>on our present grounds, appear. One thing, however, is clear. We cannot 
<A NAME="41"></A>pass beyond body to a further kind, as we passed from length to surface, 
<A NAME="42"></A>and from surface to body. For if we could, it would cease to be true that 
<A NAME="43"></A>body is complete magnitude. We could pass beyond it only in virtue of a 
<A NAME="44"></A>defect in it; and that which is complete cannot be defective, since it 
<A NAME="45"></A>has being in every respect. Now bodies which are classed as parts of the 
<A NAME="46"></A>whole are each complete according to our formula, since each possesses 
<A NAME="47"></A>every dimension. But each is determined relatively to that part which is 
<A NAME="48"></A>next to it by contact, for which reason each of them is in a sense many 
<A NAME="49"></A>bodies. But the whole of which they are parts must necessarily be complete, 
<A NAME="50"></A>and thus, in accordance with the meaning of the word, have being, not in 
<A NAME="51"></A>some respect only, but in every respect.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="52"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>The question as to the nature of the whole, whether it is infinite 
<A NAME="54"></A>in size or limited in its total mass, is a matter for subsequent inquiry. 
<A NAME="55"></A>We will now speak of those parts of the whole which are specifically distinct. 
<A NAME="56"></A>Let us take this as our starting-point. All natural bodies and magnitudes 
<A NAME="57"></A>we hold to be, as such, capable of locomotion; for nature, we say, is their 
<A NAME="58"></A>principle of movement. But all movement that is in place, all locomotion, 
<A NAME="59"></A>as we term it, is either straight or circular or a combination of these 
<A NAME="60"></A>two, which are the only simple movements. And the reason of this is that 
<A NAME="61"></A>these two, the straight and the circular line, are the only simple magnitudes. 
<A NAME="62"></A>Now revolution about the centre is circular motion, while the upward and 
<A NAME="63"></A>downward movements are in a straight line, 'upward' meaning motion away 
<A NAME="64"></A>from the centre, and 'downward' motion towards it. All simple motion, then, 
<A NAME="65"></A>must be motion either away from or towards or about the centre. This seems 
<A NAME="66"></A>to be in exact accord with what we said above: as body found its completion 
<A NAME="67"></A>in three dimensions, so its movement completes itself in three 
<A NAME="68"></A>forms.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>Bodies are either simple or compounded of such; and by simple bodies 
<A NAME="70"></A>I mean those which possess a principle of movement in their own nature, 
<A NAME="71"></A>such as fire and earth with their kinds, and whatever is akin to them. 
<A NAME="72"></A>Necessarily, then, movements also will be either simple or in some sort 
<A NAME="73"></A>compound-simple in the case of the simple bodies, compound in that of the 
<A NAME="74"></A>composite-and in the latter case the motion will be that of the simple 
<A NAME="75"></A>body which prevails in the composition. Supposing, then, that there is 
<A NAME="76"></A>such a thing as simple movement, and that circular movement is an instance 
<A NAME="77"></A>of it, and that both movement of a simple body is simple and simple movement 
<A NAME="78"></A>is of a simple body (for if it is movement of a compound it will be in 
<A NAME="79"></A>virtue of a prevailing simple element), then there must necessarily be 
<A NAME="80"></A>some simple body which revolves naturally and in virtue of its own nature 
<A NAME="81"></A>with a circular movement. By constraint, of course, it may be brought to 
<A NAME="82"></A>move with the motion of something else different from itself, but it cannot 
<A NAME="83"></A>so move naturally, since there is one sort of movement natural to each 
<A NAME="84"></A>of the simple bodies. Again, if the unnatural movement is the contrary 
<A NAME="85"></A>of the natural and a thing can have no more than one contrary, it will 
<A NAME="86"></A>follow that circular movement, being a simple motion, must be unnatural, 
<A NAME="87"></A>if it is not natural, to the body moved. If then (1) the body, whose movement 
<A NAME="88"></A>is circular, is fire or some other element, its natural motion must be 
<A NAME="89"></A>the contrary of the circular motion. But a single thing has a single contrary; 
<A NAME="90"></A>and upward and downward motion are the contraries of one another. If, on 
<A NAME="91"></A>the other hand, (2) the body moving with this circular motion which is 
<A NAME="92"></A>unnatural to it is something different from the elements, there will be 
<A NAME="93"></A>some other motion which is natural to it. But this cannot be. For if the 
<A NAME="94"></A>natural motion is upward, it will be fire or air, and if downward, water 
<A NAME="95"></A>or earth. Further, this circular motion is necessarily primary. For the 
<A NAME="96"></A>perfect is naturally prior to the imperfect, and the circle is a perfect 
<A NAME="97"></A>thing. This cannot be said of any straight line:-not of an infinite line; 
<A NAME="98"></A>for, if it were perfect, it would have a limit and an end: nor of any finite 
<A NAME="99"></A>line; for in every case there is something beyond it, since any finite 
<A NAME="100"></A>line can be extended. And so, since the prior movement belongs to the body 
<A NAME="101"></A>which naturally prior, and circular movement is prior to straight, and 
<A NAME="102"></A>movement in a straight line belongs to simple bodies-fire moving straight 
<A NAME="103"></A>upward and earthy bodies straight downward towards the centre-since this 
<A NAME="104"></A>is so, it follows that circular movement also must be the movement of some 
<A NAME="105"></A>simple body. For the movement of composite bodies is, as we said, determined 
<A NAME="106"></A>by that simple body which preponderates in the composition. These premises 
<A NAME="107"></A>clearly give the conclusion that there is in nature some bodily substance 
<A NAME="108"></A>other than the formations we know, prior to them all and more divine than 
<A NAME="109"></A>they. But it may also be proved as follows. We may take it that all movement 
<A NAME="110"></A>is either natural or unnatural, and that the movement which is unnatural 
<A NAME="111"></A>to one body is natural to another-as, for instance, is the case with the 
<A NAME="112"></A>upward and downward movements, which are natural and unnatural to fire 
<A NAME="113"></A>and earth respectively. It necessarily follows that circular movement, 
<A NAME="114"></A>being unnatural to these bodies, is the natural movement of some other. 
<A NAME="115"></A>Further, if, on the one hand, circular movement is natural to something, 
<A NAME="116"></A>it must surely be some simple and primary body which is ordained to move 
<A NAME="117"></A>with a natural circular motion, as fire is ordained to fly up and earth 
<A NAME="118"></A>down. If, on the other hand, the movement of the rotating bodies about 
<A NAME="119"></A>the centre is unnatural, it would be remarkable and indeed quite inconceivable 
<A NAME="120"></A>that this movement alone should be continuous and eternal, being nevertheless 
<A NAME="121"></A>contrary to nature. At any rate the evidence of all other cases goes to 
<A NAME="122"></A>show that it is the unnatural which quickest passes away. And so, if, as 
<A NAME="123"></A>some say, the body so moved is fire, this movement is just as unnatural 
<A NAME="124"></A>to it as downward movement; for any one can see that fire moves in a straight 
<A NAME="125"></A>line away from the centre. On all these grounds, therefore, we may infer 
<A NAME="126"></A>with confidence that there is something beyond the bodies that are about 
<A NAME="127"></A>us on this earth, different and separate from them; and that the superior 
<A NAME="128"></A>glory of its nature is proportionate to its distance from this world of 
<A NAME="129"></A>ours.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="130"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>In consequence of what has been said, in part by way of assumption 
<A NAME="132"></A>and in part by way of proof, it is clear that not every body either possesses 
<A NAME="133"></A>lightness or heaviness. As a preliminary we must explain in what sense 
<A NAME="134"></A>we are using the words 'heavy' and 'light', sufficiently, at least, for 
<A NAME="135"></A>our present purpose: we can examine the terms more closely later, when 
<A NAME="136"></A>we come to consider their essential nature. Let us then apply the term 
<A NAME="137"></A>'heavy' to that which naturally moves towards the centre, and 'light' to 
<A NAME="138"></A>that which moves naturally away from the centre. The heaviest thing will 
<A NAME="139"></A>be that which sinks to the bottom of all things that move downward, and 
<A NAME="140"></A>the lightest that which rises to the surface of everything that moves upward. 
<A NAME="141"></A>Now, necessarily, everything which moves either up or down possesses lightness 
<A NAME="142"></A>or heaviness or both-but not both relatively to the same thing: for things 
<A NAME="143"></A>are heavy and light relatively to one another; air, for instance, is light 
<A NAME="144"></A>relatively to water, and water light relatively to earth. The body, then, 
<A NAME="145"></A>which moves in a circle cannot possibly possess either heaviness or lightness. 
<A NAME="146"></A>For neither naturally nor unnaturally can it move either towards or away 
<A NAME="147"></A>from the centre. Movement in a straight line certainly does not belong 
<A NAME="148"></A>to it naturally, since one sort of movement is, as we saw, appropriate 
<A NAME="149"></A>to each simple body, and so we should be compelled to identify it with 
<A NAME="150"></A>one of the bodies which move in this way. Suppose, then, that the movement 
<A NAME="151"></A>is unnatural. In that case, if it is the downward movement which is unnatural, 
<A NAME="152"></A>the upward movement will be natural; and if it is the upward which is unnatural, 
<A NAME="153"></A>the downward will be natural. For we decided that of contrary movements, 
<A NAME="154"></A>if the one is unnatural to anything, the other will be natural to it. But 
<A NAME="155"></A>since the natural movement of the whole and of its part of earth, for instance, 
<A NAME="156"></A>as a whole and of a small clod-have one and the same direction, it results, 
<A NAME="157"></A>in the first place, that this body can possess no lightness or heaviness 
<A NAME="158"></A>at all (for that would mean that it could move by its own nature either 
<A NAME="159"></A>from or towards the centre, which, as we know, is impossible); and, secondly, 
<A NAME="160"></A>that it cannot possibly move in the way of locomotion by being forced violently 
<A NAME="161"></A>aside in an upward or downward direction. For neither naturally nor unnaturally 
<A NAME="162"></A>can it move with any other motion but its own, either itself or any part 
<A NAME="163"></A>of it, since the reasoning which applies to the whole applies also to the 
<A NAME="164"></A>part.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>It is equally reasonable to assume that this body will be ungenerated 
<A NAME="166"></A>and indestructible and exempt from increase and alteration, since everything 
<A NAME="167"></A>that comes to be comes into being from its contrary and in some substrate, 
<A NAME="168"></A>and passes away likewise in a substrate by the action of the contrary into 
<A NAME="169"></A>the contrary, as we explained in our opening discussions. Now the motions 
<A NAME="170"></A>of contraries are contrary. If then this body can have no contrary, because 
<A NAME="171"></A>there can be no contrary motion to the circular, nature seems justly to 
<A NAME="172"></A>have exempted from contraries the body which was to be ungenerated and 
<A NAME="173"></A>indestructible. For it is in contraries that generation and decay subsist. 
<A NAME="174"></A>Again, that which is subject to increase increases upon contact with a 
<A NAME="175"></A>kindred body, which is resolved into its matter. But there is nothing out 
<A NAME="176"></A>of which this body can have been generated. And if it is exempt from increase 
<A NAME="177"></A>and diminution, the same reasoning leads us to suppose that it is also 
<A NAME="178"></A>unalterable. For alteration is movement in respect of quality; and qualitative 
<A NAME="179"></A>states and dispositions, such as health and disease, do not come into being 
<A NAME="180"></A>without changes of properties. But all natural bodies which change their 
<A NAME="181"></A>properties we see to be subject without exception to increase and diminution. 
<A NAME="182"></A>This is the case, for instance, with the bodies of animals and their parts 
<A NAME="183"></A>and with vegetable bodies, and similarly also with those of the elements. 
<A NAME="184"></A>And so, if the body which moves with a circular motion cannot admit of 
<A NAME="185"></A>increase or diminution, it is reasonable to suppose that it is also 
<A NAME="186"></A>unalterable.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>The reasons why the primary body is eternal and not subject to 
<A NAME="188"></A>increase or diminution, but unaging and unalterable and unmodified, will 
<A NAME="189"></A>be clear from what has been said to any one who believes in our assumptions. 
<A NAME="190"></A>Our theory seems to confirm experience and to be confirmed by it. For all 
<A NAME="191"></A>men have some conception of the nature of the gods, and all who believe 
<A NAME="192"></A>in the existence of gods at all, whether barbarian or Greek, agree in allotting 
<A NAME="193"></A>the highest place to the deity, surely because they suppose that immortal 
<A NAME="194"></A>is linked with immortal and regard any other supposition as inconceivable. 
<A NAME="195"></A>If then there is, as there certainly is, anything divine, what we have 
<A NAME="196"></A>just said about the primary bodily substance was well said. The mere evidence 
<A NAME="197"></A>of the senses is enough to convince us of this, at least with human certainty. 
<A NAME="198"></A>For in the whole range of time past, so far as our inherited records reach, 
<A NAME="199"></A>no change appears to have taken place either in the whole scheme of the 
<A NAME="200"></A>outermost heaven or in any of its proper parts. The common name, too, which 
<A NAME="201"></A>has been handed down from our distant ancestors even to our own day, seems 
<A NAME="202"></A>to show that they conceived of it in the fashion which we have been expressing. 
<A NAME="203"></A>The same ideas, one must believe, recur in men's minds not once or twice 
<A NAME="204"></A>but again and again. And so, implying that the primary body is something 
<A NAME="205"></A>else beyond earth, fire, air, and water, they gave the highest place a 
<A NAME="206"></A>name of its own, aither, derived from the fact that it 'runs always' for 
<A NAME="207"></A>an eternity of time. Anaxagoras, however, scandalously misuses this name, 
<A NAME="208"></A>taking aither as equivalent to fire.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>It is also clear from what has been said why the number of what 
<A NAME="210"></A>we call simple bodies cannot be greater than it is. The motion of a simple 
<A NAME="211"></A>body must itself be simple, and we assert that there are only these two 
<A NAME="212"></A>simple motions, the circular and the straight, the latter being subdivided 
<A NAME="213"></A>into motion away from and motion towards the centre.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="214"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>That there is no other form of motion opposed as contrary to the 
<A NAME="216"></A>circular may be proved in various ways. In the first place, there is an 
<A NAME="217"></A>obvious tendency to oppose the straight line to the circular. For concave 
<A NAME="218"></A>and convex are a not only regarded as opposed to one another, but they 
<A NAME="219"></A>are also coupled together and treated as a unity in opposition to the straight. 
<A NAME="220"></A>And so, if there is a contrary to circular motion, motion in a straight 
<A NAME="221"></A>line must be recognized as having the best claim to that name. But the 
<A NAME="222"></A>two forms of rectilinear motion are opposed to one another by reason of 
<A NAME="223"></A>their places; for up and down is a difference and a contrary opposition 
<A NAME="224"></A>in place. Secondly, it may be thought that the same reasoning which holds 
<A NAME="225"></A>good of the rectilinear path applies also the circular, movement from A 
<A NAME="226"></A>to B being opposed as contrary to movement from B to A. But what is meant 
<A NAME="227"></A>is still rectilinear motion. For that is limited to a single path, while 
<A NAME="228"></A>the circular paths which pass through the same two points are infinite 
<A NAME="229"></A>in number. Even if we are confined to the single semicircle and the opposition 
<A NAME="230"></A>is between movement from C to D and from D to C along that semicircle, 
<A NAME="231"></A>the case is no better. For the motion is the same as that along the diameter, 
<A NAME="232"></A>since we invariably regard the distance between two points as the length 
<A NAME="233"></A>of the straight line which joins them. It is no more satisfactory to construct 
<A NAME="234"></A>a circle and treat motion 'along one semicircle as contrary to motion along 
<A NAME="235"></A>the other. For example, taking a complete circle, motion from E to F on 
<A NAME="236"></A>the semicircle G may be opposed to motion from F to E on the semicircle 
<A NAME="237"></A>H. But even supposing these are contraries, it in no way follows that the 
<A NAME="238"></A>reverse motions on the complete circumference contraries. Nor again can 
<A NAME="239"></A>motion along the circle from A to B be regarded as the contrary of motion 
<A NAME="240"></A>from A to C: for the motion goes from the same point towards the same point, 
<A NAME="241"></A>and contrary motion was distinguished as motion from a contrary to its 
<A NAME="242"></A>contrary. And even if the motion round a circle is the contrary of the 
<A NAME="243"></A>reverse motion, one of the two would be ineffective: for both move to the 
<A NAME="244"></A>same point, because that which moves in a circle, at whatever point it 
<A NAME="245"></A>begins, must necessarily pass through all the contrary places alike. (By 
<A NAME="246"></A>contrarieties of place I mean up and down, back and front, and right and 
<A NAME="247"></A>left; and the contrary oppositions of movements are determined by those 
<A NAME="248"></A>of places.) One of the motions, then, would be ineffective, for if the 
<A NAME="249"></A>two motions were of equal strength, there would be no movement either way, 
<A NAME="250"></A>and if one of the two were preponderant, the other would be inoperative. 
<A NAME="251"></A>So that if both bodies were there, one of them, inasmuch as it would not 
<A NAME="252"></A>be moving with its own movement, would be useless, in the sense in which 
<A NAME="253"></A>a shoe is useless when it is not worn. But God and nature create nothing 
<A NAME="254"></A>that has not its use.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="255"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>This being clear, we must go on to consider the questions which 
<A NAME="257"></A>remain. First, is there an infinite body, as the majority of the ancient 
<A NAME="258"></A>philosophers thought, or is this an impossibility? The decision of this 
<A NAME="259"></A>question, either way, is not unimportant, but rather all-important, to 
<A NAME="260"></A>our search for the truth. It is this problem which has practically always 
<A NAME="261"></A>been the source of the differences of those who have written about nature 
<A NAME="262"></A>as a whole. So it has been and so it must be; since the least initial deviation 
<A NAME="263"></A>from the truth is multiplied later a thousandfold. Admit, for instance, 
<A NAME="264"></A>the existence of a minimum magnitude, and you will find that the minimum 
<A NAME="265"></A>which you have introduced, small as it is, causes the greatest truths of 
<A NAME="266"></A>mathematics to totter. The reason is that a principle is great rather in 
<A NAME="267"></A>power than in extent; hence that which was small at the start turns out 
<A NAME="268"></A>a giant at the end. Now the conception of the infinite possesses this power 
<A NAME="269"></A>of principles, and indeed in the sphere of quantity possesses it in a higher 
<A NAME="270"></A>degree than any other conception; so that it is in no way absurd or unreasonable 
<A NAME="271"></A>that the assumption that an infinite body exists should be of peculiar 
<A NAME="272"></A>moment to our inquiry. The infinite, then, we must now discuss, opening 
<A NAME="273"></A>the whole matter from the beginning.
<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>Every body is necessarily to be classed either as simple or as 
<A NAME="275"></A>composite; the infinite body, therefore, will be either simple or 
<A NAME="276"></A>composite.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>But it is clear, further, that if the simple bodies are finite, 
<A NAME="278"></A>the composite must also be finite, since that which is composed of bodies 
<A NAME="279"></A>finite both in number and in magnitude is itself finite in respect of number 
<A NAME="280"></A>and magnitude: its quantity is in fact the same as that of the bodies which 
<A NAME="281"></A>compose it. What remains for us to consider, then, is whether any of the 
<A NAME="282"></A>simple bodies can be infinite in magnitude, or whether this is impossible. 
<A NAME="283"></A>Let us try the primary body first, and then go on to consider the 
<A NAME="284"></A>others.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>The body which moves in a circle must necessarily be finite in 
<A NAME="286"></A>every respect, for the following reasons. (1) If the body so moving is 
<A NAME="287"></A>infinite, the radii drawn from the centre will be infinite. But the space 
<A NAME="288"></A>between infinite radii is infinite: and by the space between the radii 
<A NAME="289"></A>I mean the area outside which no magnitude which is in contact with the 
<A NAME="290"></A>two lines can be conceived as falling. This, I say, will be infinite: first, 
<A NAME="291"></A>because in the case of finite radii it is always finite; and secondly, 
<A NAME="292"></A>because in it one can always go on to a width greater than any given width; 
<A NAME="293"></A>thus the reasoning which forces us to believe in infinite number, because 
<A NAME="294"></A>there is no maximum, applies also to the space between the radii. Now the 
<A NAME="295"></A>infinite cannot be traversed, and if the body is infinite the interval 
<A NAME="296"></A>between the radii is necessarily infinite: circular motion therefore is 
<A NAME="297"></A>an impossibility. Yet our eyes tell us that the heavens revolve in a circle, 
<A NAME="298"></A>and by argument also we have determined that there is something to which 
<A NAME="299"></A>circular movement belongs.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>(2) Again, if from a finite time a finite time be subtracted, what 
<A NAME="301"></A>remains must be finite and have a beginning. And if the time of a journey 
<A NAME="302"></A>has a beginning, there must be a beginning also of the movement, and consequently 
<A NAME="303"></A>also of the distance traversed. This applies universally. Take a line, 
<A NAME="304"></A>ACE, infinite in one direction, E, and another line, BB, infinite in both 
<A NAME="305"></A>directions. Let ACE describe a circle, revolving upon C as centre. In its 
<A NAME="306"></A>movement it will cut BB continuously for a certain time. This will be a 
<A NAME="307"></A>finite time, since the total time is finite in which the heavens complete 
<A NAME="308"></A>their circular orbit, and consequently the time subtracted from it, during 
<A NAME="309"></A>which the one line in its motion cuts the other, is also finite. Therefore 
<A NAME="310"></A>there will be a point at which ACE began for the first time to cut BB. 
<A NAME="311"></A>This, however, is impossible. The infinite, then, cannot revolve in a circle; 
<A NAME="312"></A>nor could the world, if it were infinite.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>(3) That the infinite cannot move may also be shown as follows. 
<A NAME="314"></A>Let A be a finite line moving past the finite line, B. Of necessity A will 
<A NAME="315"></A>pass clear of B and B of A at the same moment; for each overlaps the other 
<A NAME="316"></A>to precisely the same extent. Now if the two were both moving, and moving 
<A NAME="317"></A>in contrary directions, they would pass clear of one another more rapidly; 
<A NAME="318"></A>if one were still and the other moving past it, less rapidly; provided 
<A NAME="319"></A>that the speed of the latter were the same in both cases. This, however, 
<A NAME="320"></A>is clear: that it is impossible to traverse an infinite line in a finite 
<A NAME="321"></A>time. Infinite time, then, would be required. (This we demonstrated above 
<A NAME="322"></A>in the discussion of movement.) And it makes no difference whether a finite 
<A NAME="323"></A>is passing by an infinite or an infinite by a finite. For when A is passing 
<A NAME="324"></A>B, then B overlaps A and it makes no difference whether B is moved or unmoved, 
<A NAME="325"></A>except that, if both move, they pass clear of one another more quickly. 
<A NAME="326"></A>It is, however, quite possible that a moving line should in certain cases 
<A NAME="327"></A>pass one which is stationary quicker than it passes one moving in an opposite 
<A NAME="328"></A>direction. One has only to imagine the movement to be slow where both move 
<A NAME="329"></A>and much faster where one is stationary. To suppose one line stationary, 
<A NAME="330"></A>then, makes no difficulty for our argument, since it is quite possible 
<A NAME="331"></A>for A to pass B at a slower rate when both are moving than when only one 
<A NAME="332"></A>is. If, therefore, the time which the finite moving line takes to pass 
<A NAME="333"></A>the other is infinite, then necessarily the time occupied by the motion 
<A NAME="334"></A>of the infinite past the finite is also infinite. For the infinite to move 
<A NAME="335"></A>at all is thus absolutely impossible; since the very smallest movement 
<A NAME="336"></A>conceivable must take an infinity of time. Moreover the heavens certainly 
<A NAME="337"></A>revolve, and they complete their circular orbit in a finite time; so that 
<A NAME="338"></A>they pass round the whole extent of any line within their orbit, such as 
<A NAME="339"></A>the finite line AB. The revolving body, therefore, cannot be 
<A NAME="340"></A>infinite.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>(4) Again, as a line which has a limit cannot be infinite, or, 
<A NAME="342"></A>if it is infinite, is so only in length, so a surface cannot be infinite 
<A NAME="343"></A>in that respect in which it has a limit; or, indeed, if it is completely 
<A NAME="344"></A>determinate, in any respect whatever. Whether it be a square or a circle 
<A NAME="345"></A>or a sphere, it cannot be infinite, any more than a foot-rule can. There 
<A NAME="346"></A>is then no such thing as an infinite sphere or square or circle, and where 
<A NAME="347"></A>there is no circle there can be no circular movement, and similarly where 
<A NAME="348"></A>there is no infinite at all there can be no infinite movement; and from 
<A NAME="349"></A>this it follows that, an infinite circle being itself an impossibility, 
<A NAME="350"></A>there can be no circular motion of an infinite body.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>(5) Again, take a centre C, an infinite line, AB, another infinite 
<A NAME="352"></A>line at right angles to it, E, and a moving radius, CD. CD will never cease 
<A NAME="353"></A>contact with E, but the position will always be something like CE, CD cutting 
<A NAME="354"></A>E at F. The infinite line, therefore, refuses to complete the 
<A NAME="355"></A>circle.
<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>(6) Again, if the heaven is infinite and moves in a circle, we 
<A NAME="357"></A>shall have to admit that in a finite time it has traversed the infinite. 
<A NAME="358"></A>For suppose the fixed heaven infinite, and that which moves within it equal 
<A NAME="359"></A>to it. It results that when the infinite body has completed its revolution, 
<A NAME="360"></A>it has traversed an infinite equal to itself in a finite time. But that 
<A NAME="361"></A>we know to be impossible.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>(7) It can also be shown, conversely, that if the time of revolution 
<A NAME="363"></A>is finite, the area traversed must also be finite; but the area traversed 
<A NAME="364"></A>was equal to itself; therefore, it is itself finite.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>We have now shown that the body which moves in a circle is not 
<A NAME="366"></A>endless or infinite, but has its limit.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="367"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>Further, neither that which moves towards nor that which moves 
<A NAME="369"></A>away from the centre can be infinite. For the upward and downward motions 
<A NAME="370"></A>are contraries and are therefore motions towards contrary places. But if 
<A NAME="371"></A>one of a pair of contraries is determinate, the other must be determinate 
<A NAME="372"></A>also. Now the centre is determined; for, from whatever point the body which 
<A NAME="373"></A>sinks to the bottom starts its downward motion, it cannot go farther than 
<A NAME="374"></A>the centre. The centre, therefore, being determinate, the upper place must 
<A NAME="375"></A>also be determinate. But if these two places are determined and finite, 
<A NAME="376"></A>the corresponding bodies must also be finite. Further, if up and down are 
<A NAME="377"></A>determinate, the intermediate place is also necessarily determinate. For, 
<A NAME="378"></A>if it is indeterminate, the movement within it will be infinite; and that 
<A NAME="379"></A>we have already shown to be an impossibility. The middle region then is 
<A NAME="380"></A>determinate, and consequently any body which either is in it, or might 
<A NAME="381"></A>be in it, is determinate. But the bodies which move up and down may be 
<A NAME="382"></A>in it, since the one moves naturally away from the centre and the other 
<A NAME="383"></A>towards it.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>From this alone it is clear that an infinite body is an impossibility; 
<A NAME="385"></A>but there is a further point. If there is no such thing as infinite weight, 
<A NAME="386"></A>then it follows that none of these bodies can be infinite. For the supposed 
<A NAME="387"></A>infinite body would have to be infinite in weight. (The same argument applies 
<A NAME="388"></A>to lightness: for as the one supposition involves infinite weight, so the 
<A NAME="389"></A>infinity of the body which rises to the surface involves infinite lightness.) 
<A NAME="390"></A>This is proved as follows. Assume the weight to be finite, and take an 
<A NAME="391"></A>infinite body, AB, of the weight C. Subtract from the infinite body a finite 
<A NAME="392"></A>mass, BD, the weight of which shall be E. E then is less than C, since 
<A NAME="393"></A>it is the weight of a lesser mass. Suppose then that the smaller goes into 
<A NAME="394"></A>the greater a certain number of times, and take BF bearing the same proportion 
<A NAME="395"></A>to BD which the greater weight bears to the smaller. For you may subtract 
<A NAME="396"></A>as much as you please from an infinite. If now the masses are proportionate 
<A NAME="397"></A>to the weights, and the lesser weight is that of the lesser mass, the greater 
<A NAME="398"></A>must be that of the greater. The weights, therefore, of the finite and 
<A NAME="399"></A>of the infinite body are equal. Again, if the weight of a greater body 
<A NAME="400"></A>is greater than that of a less, the weight of GB will be greater than that 
<A NAME="401"></A>of FB; and thus the weight of the finite body is greater than that of the 
<A NAME="402"></A>infinite. And, further, the weight of unequal masses will be the same, 
<A NAME="403"></A>since the infinite and the finite cannot be equal. It does not matter whether 
<A NAME="404"></A>the weights are commensurable or not. If (a) they are incommensurable the 
<A NAME="405"></A>same reasoning holds. For instance, suppose E multiplied by three is rather 
<A NAME="406"></A>more than C: the weight of three masses of the full size of BD will be 
<A NAME="407"></A>greater than C. We thus arrive at the same impossibility as before. Again 
<A NAME="408"></A>(b) we may assume weights which are commensurate; for it makes no difference 
<A NAME="409"></A>whether we begin with the weight or with the mass. For example, assume 
<A NAME="410"></A>the weight E to be commensurate with C, and take from the infinite mass 
<A NAME="411"></A>a part BD of weight E. Then let a mass BF be taken having the same proportion 
<A NAME="412"></A>to BD which the two weights have to one another. (For the mass being infinite 
<A NAME="413"></A>you may subtract from it as much as you please.) These assumed bodies will 
<A NAME="414"></A>be commensurate in mass and in weight alike. Nor again does it make any 
<A NAME="415"></A>difference to our demonstration whether the total mass has its weight equally 
<A NAME="416"></A>or unequally distributed. For it must always be Possible to take from the 
<A NAME="417"></A>infinite mass a body of equal weight to BD by diminishing or increasing 
<A NAME="418"></A>the size of the section to the necessary extent.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>From what we have said, then, it is clear that the weight of the 
<A NAME="420"></A>infinite body cannot be finite. It must then be infinite. We have therefore 
<A NAME="421"></A>only to show this to be impossible in order to prove an infinite body impossible. 
<A NAME="422"></A>But the impossibility of infinite weight can be shown in the following 
<A NAME="423"></A>way. A given weight moves a given distance in a given time; a weight which 
<A NAME="424"></A>is as great and more moves the same distance in a less time, the times 
<A NAME="425"></A>being in inverse proportion to the weights. For instance, if one weight 
<A NAME="426"></A>is twice another, it will take half as long over a given movement. Further, 
<A NAME="427"></A>a finite weight traverses any finite distance in a finite time. It necessarily 
<A NAME="428"></A>follows from this that infinite weight, if there is such a thing, being, 
<A NAME="429"></A>on the one hand, as great and more than as great as the finite, will move 
<A NAME="430"></A>accordingly, but being, on the other hand, compelled to move in a time 
<A NAME="431"></A>inversely proportionate to its greatness, cannot move at all. The time 
<A NAME="432"></A>should be less in proportion as the weight is greater. But there is no 
<A NAME="433"></A>proportion between the infinite and the finite: proportion can only hold 
<A NAME="434"></A>between a less and a greater finite time. And though you may say that the 
<A NAME="435"></A>time of the movement can be continually diminished, yet there is no minimum. 
<A NAME="436"></A>Nor, if there were, would it help us. For some finite body could have been 
<A NAME="437"></A>found greater than the given finite in the same proportion which is supposed 
<A NAME="438"></A>to hold between the infinite and the given finite; so that an infinite 
<A NAME="439"></A>and a finite weight must have traversed an equal distance in equal time. 
<A NAME="440"></A>But that is impossible. Again, whatever the time, so long as it is finite, 
<A NAME="441"></A>in which the infinite performs the motion, a finite weight must necessarily 
<A NAME="442"></A>move a certain finite distance in that same time. Infinite weight is therefore 
<A NAME="443"></A>impossible, and the same reasoning applies also to infinite lightness. 
<A NAME="444"></A>Bodies then of infinite weight and of infinite lightness are equally 
<A NAME="445"></A>impossible.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR>That there is no infinite body may be shown, as we have shown it, 
<A NAME="447"></A>by a detailed consideration of the various cases. But it may also be shown 
<A NAME="448"></A>universally, not only by such reasoning as we advanced in our discussion 
<A NAME="449"></A>of principles (though in that passage we have already determined universally 
<A NAME="450"></A>the sense in which the existence of an infinite is to be asserted or denied), 
<A NAME="451"></A>but also suitably to our present purpose in the following way. That will 
<A NAME="452"></A>lead us to a further question. Even if the total mass is not infinite, 
<A NAME="453"></A>it may yet be great enough to admit a plurality of universes. The question 
<A NAME="454"></A>might possibly be raised whether there is any obstacle to our believing 
<A NAME="455"></A>that there are other universes composed on the pattern of our own, more 
<A NAME="456"></A>than one, though stopping short of infinity. First, however, let us treat 
<A NAME="457"></A>of the infinite universally.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="458"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>Every body must necessarily be either finite or infinite, and if 
<A NAME="460"></A>infinite, either of similar or of dissimilar parts. If its parts are dissimilar, 
<A NAME="461"></A>they must represent either a finite or an infinite number of kinds. That 
<A NAME="462"></A>the kinds cannot be infinite is evident, if our original presuppositions 
<A NAME="463"></A>remain unchallenged. For the primary movements being finite in number, 
<A NAME="464"></A>the kinds of simple body are necessarily also finite, since the movement 
<A NAME="465"></A>of a simple body is simple, and the simple movements are finite, and every 
<A NAME="466"></A>natural body must always have its proper motion. Now if the infinite body 
<A NAME="467"></A>is to be composed of a finite number of kinds, then each of its parts must 
<A NAME="468"></A>necessarily be infinite in quantity, that is to say, the water, fire, &c., 
<A NAME="469"></A>which compose it. But this is impossible, because, as we have already shown, 
<A NAME="470"></A>infinite weight and lightness do not exist. Moreover it would be necessary 
<A NAME="471"></A>also that their places should be infinite in extent, so that the movements 
<A NAME="472"></A>too of all these bodies would be infinite. But this is not possible, if 
<A NAME="473"></A>we are to hold to the truth of our original presuppositions and to the 
<A NAME="474"></A>view that neither that which moves downward, nor, by the same reasoning, 
<A NAME="475"></A>that which moves upward, can prolong its movement to infinity. For it is 
<A NAME="476"></A>true in regard to quality, quantity, and place alike that any process of 
<A NAME="477"></A>change is impossible which can have no end. I mean that if it is impossible 
<A NAME="478"></A>for a thing to have come to be white, or a cubit long, or in Egypt, it 
<A NAME="479"></A>is also impossible for it to be in process of coming to be any of these. 
<A NAME="480"></A>It is thus impossible for a thing to be moving to a place at which in its 
<A NAME="481"></A>motion it can never by any possibility arrive. Again, suppose the body 
<A NAME="482"></A>to exist in dispersion, it may be maintained none the less that the total 
<A NAME="483"></A>of all these scattered particles, say, of fire, is infinite. But body we 
<A NAME="484"></A>saw to be that which has extension every way. How can there be several 
<A NAME="485"></A>dissimilar elements, each infinite? Each would have to be infinitely extended 
<A NAME="486"></A>every way.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>It is no more conceivable, again, that the infinite should exist 
<A NAME="488"></A>as a whole of similar parts. For, in the first place, there is no other 
<A NAME="489"></A>(straight) movement beyond those mentioned: we must therefore give it one 
<A NAME="490"></A>of them. And if so, we shall have to admit either infinite weight or infinite 
<A NAME="491"></A>lightness. Nor, secondly, could the body whose movement is circular be 
<A NAME="492"></A>infinite, since it is impossible for the infinite to move in a circle. 
<A NAME="493"></A>This, indeed, would be as good as saying that the heavens are infinite, 
<A NAME="494"></A>which we have shown to be impossible.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, in general, it is impossible that the infinite should 
<A NAME="496"></A>move at all. If it did, it would move either naturally or by constraint: 
<A NAME="497"></A>and if by constraint, it possesses also a natural motion, that is to say, 
<A NAME="498"></A>there is another place, infinite like itself, to which it will move. But 
<A NAME="499"></A>that is impossible.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>That in general it is impossible for the infinite to be acted upon 
<A NAME="501"></A>by the finite or to act upon it may be shown as follows.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>(1. The infinite cannot be acted upon by the finite.) Let A be 
<A NAME="503"></A>an infinite, B a finite, C the time of a given movement produced by one 
<A NAME="504"></A>in the other. Suppose, then, that A was heated, or impelled, or modified 
<A NAME="505"></A>in any way, or caused to undergo any sort of movement whatever, by in the 
<A NAME="506"></A>time C. Let D be less than B; and, assuming that a lesser agent moves a 
<A NAME="507"></A>lesser patient in an equal time, call the quantity thus modified by D, 
<A NAME="508"></A>E. Then, as D is to B, so is E to some finite quantum. We assume that the 
<A NAME="509"></A>alteration of equal by equal takes equal time, and the alteration of less 
<A NAME="510"></A>by less or of greater by greater takes the same time, if the quantity of 
<A NAME="511"></A>the patient is such as to keep the proportion which obtains between the 
<A NAME="512"></A>agents, greater and less. If so, no movement can be caused in the infinite 
<A NAME="513"></A>by any finite agent in any time whatever. For a less agent will produce 
<A NAME="514"></A>that movement in a less patient in an equal time, and the proportionate 
<A NAME="515"></A>equivalent of that patient will be a finite quantity, since no proportion 
<A NAME="516"></A>holds between finite and infinite.
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>(2. The infinite cannot act upon the finite.) Nor, again, can the 
<A NAME="518"></A>infinite produce a movement in the finite in any time whatever. Let A be 
<A NAME="519"></A>an infinite, B a finite, C the time of action. In the time C, D will produce 
<A NAME="520"></A>that motion in a patient less than B, say F. Then take E, bearing the same 
<A NAME="521"></A>proportion to D as the whole BF bears to F. E will produce the motion in 
<A NAME="522"></A>BF in the time C. Thus the finite and infinite effect the same alteration 
<A NAME="523"></A>in equal times. But this is impossible; for the assumption is that the 
<A NAME="524"></A>greater effects it in a shorter time. It will be the same with any time 
<A NAME="525"></A>that can be taken, so that there will no time in which the infinite can 
<A NAME="526"></A>effect this movement. And, as to infinite time, in that nothing can move 
<A NAME="527"></A>another or be moved by it. For such time has no limit, while the action 
<A NAME="528"></A>and reaction have.
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>(3. There is no interaction between infinites.) Nor can infinite 
<A NAME="530"></A>be acted upon in any way by infinite. Let A and B be infinites, CD being 
<A NAME="531"></A>the time of the action A of upon B. Now the whole B was modified in a certain 
<A NAME="532"></A>time, and the part of this infinite, E, cannot be so modified in the same 
<A NAME="533"></A>time, since we assume that a less quantity makes the movement in a less 
<A NAME="534"></A>time. Let E then, when acted upon by A, complete the movement in the time 
<A NAME="535"></A>D. Then, as D is to CD, so is E to some finite part of B. This part will 
<A NAME="536"></A>necessarily be moved by A in the time CD. For we suppose that the same 
<A NAME="537"></A>agent produces a given effect on a greater and a smaller mass in longer 
<A NAME="538"></A>and shorter times, the times and masses varying proportionately. There 
<A NAME="539"></A>is thus no finite time in which infinites can move one another. Is their 
<A NAME="540"></A>time then infinite? No, for infinite time has no end, but the movement 
<A NAME="541"></A>communicated has.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>If therefore every perceptible body possesses the power of acting 
<A NAME="543"></A>or of being acted upon, or both of these, it is impossible that an infinite 
<A NAME="544"></A>body should be perceptible. All bodies, however, that occupy place are 
<A NAME="545"></A>perceptible. There is therefore no infinite body beyond the heaven. Nor 
<A NAME="546"></A>again is there anything of limited extent beyond it. And so beyond the 
<A NAME="547"></A>heaven there is no body at all. For if you suppose it an object of intelligence, 
<A NAME="548"></A>it will be in a place-since place is what 'within' and 'beyond' denote-and 
<A NAME="549"></A>therefore an object of perception. But nothing that is not in a place is 
<A NAME="550"></A>perceptible.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR>The question may also be examined in the light of more general 
<A NAME="552"></A>considerations as follows. The infinite, considered as a whole of similar 
<A NAME="553"></A>parts, cannot, on the one hand, move in a circle. For there is no centre 
<A NAME="554"></A>of the infinite, and that which moves in a circle moves about the centre. 
<A NAME="555"></A>Nor again can the infinite move in a straight line. For there would have 
<A NAME="556"></A>to be another place infinite like itself to be the goal of its natural 
<A NAME="557"></A>movement and another, equally great, for the goal of its unnatural movement. 
<A NAME="558"></A>Moreover, whether its rectilinear movement is natural or constrained, in 
<A NAME="559"></A>either case the force which causes its motion will have to be infinite. 
<A NAME="560"></A>For infinite force is force of an infinite body, and of an infinite body 
<A NAME="561"></A>the force is infinite. So the motive body also will be infinite. (The proof 
<A NAME="562"></A>of this is given in our discussion of movement, where it is shown that 
<A NAME="563"></A>no finite thing possesses infinite power, and no infinite thing finite 
<A NAME="564"></A>power.) If then that which moves naturally can also move unnaturally, there 
<A NAME="565"></A>will be two infinites, one which causes, and another which exhibits the 
<A NAME="566"></A>latter motion. Again, what is it that moves the infinite? If it moves itself, 
<A NAME="567"></A>it must be animate. But how can it possibly be conceived as an infinite 
<A NAME="568"></A>animal? And if there is something else that moves it, there will be two 
<A NAME="569"></A>infinites, that which moves and that which is moved, differing in their 
<A NAME="570"></A>form and power.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR>If the whole is not continuous, but exists, as Democritus and Leucippus 
<A NAME="572"></A>think, in the form of parts separated by void, there must necessarily be 
<A NAME="573"></A>one movement of all the multitude. They are distinguished, we are told, 
<A NAME="574"></A>from one another by their figures; but their nature is one, like many pieces 
<A NAME="575"></A>of gold separated from one another. But each piece must, as we assert, 
<A NAME="576"></A>have the same motion. For a single clod moves to the same place as the 
<A NAME="577"></A>whole mass of earth, and a spark to the same place as the whole mass of 
<A NAME="578"></A>fire. So that if it be weight that all possess, no body is, strictly speaking, 
<A NAME="579"></A>light: and if lightness be universal, none is heavy. Moreover, whatever 
<A NAME="580"></A>possesses weight or lightness will have its place either at one of the 
<A NAME="581"></A>extremes or in the middle region. But this is impossible while the world 
<A NAME="582"></A>is conceived as infinite. And, generally, that which has no centre or extreme 
<A NAME="583"></A>limit, no up or down, gives the bodies no place for their motion; and without 
<A NAME="584"></A>that movement is impossible. A thing must move either naturally or unnaturally, 
<A NAME="585"></A>and the two movements are determined by the proper and alien places. Again, 
<A NAME="586"></A>a place in which a thing rests or to which it moves unnaturally, must be 
<A NAME="587"></A>the natural place for some other body, as experience shows. Necessarily, 
<A NAME="588"></A>therefore, not everything possesses weight or lightness, but some things 
<A NAME="589"></A>do and some do not. From these arguments then it is clear that the body 
<A NAME="590"></A>of the universe is not infinite.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="591"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>We must now proceed to explain why there cannot be more than one 
<A NAME="593"></A>heaven-the further question mentioned above. For it may be thought that 
<A NAME="594"></A>we have not proved universal of bodies that none whatever can exist outside 
<A NAME="595"></A>our universe, and that our argument applied only to those of indeterminate 
<A NAME="596"></A>extent.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>Now all things rest and move naturally and by constraint. A thing 
<A NAME="598"></A>moves naturally to a place in which it rests without constraint, and rests 
<A NAME="599"></A>naturally in a place to which it moves without constraint. On the other 
<A NAME="600"></A>hand, a thing moves by constraint to a place in which it rests by constraint, 
<A NAME="601"></A>and rests by constraint in a place to which it moves by constraint. Further, 
<A NAME="602"></A>if a given movement is due to constraint, its contrary is natural. If, 
<A NAME="603"></A>then, it is by constraint that earth moves from a certain place to the 
<A NAME="604"></A>centre here, its movement from here to there will be natural, and if earth 
<A NAME="605"></A>from there rests here without constraint, its movement hither will be natural. 
<A NAME="606"></A>And the natural movement in each case is one. Further, these worlds, being 
<A NAME="607"></A>similar in nature to ours, must all be composed of the same bodies as it. 
<A NAME="608"></A>Moreover each of the bodies, fire, I mean, and earth and their intermediates, 
<A NAME="609"></A>must have the same power as in our world. For if these names are used equivocally, 
<A NAME="610"></A>if the identity of name does not rest upon an identity of form in these 
<A NAME="611"></A>elements and ours, then the whole to which they belong can only be called 
<A NAME="612"></A>a world by equivocation. Clearly, then, one of the bodies will move naturally 
<A NAME="613"></A>away from the centre and another towards the centre, since fire must be 
<A NAME="614"></A>identical with fire, earth with earth, and so on, as the fragments of each 
<A NAME="615"></A>are identical in this world. That this must be the case is evident from 
<A NAME="616"></A>the principles laid down in our discussion of the movements, for these 
<A NAME="617"></A>are limited in number, and the distinction of the elements depends upon 
<A NAME="618"></A>the distinction of the movements. Therefore, since the movements are the 
<A NAME="619"></A>same, the elements must also be the same everywhere. The particles of earth, 
<A NAME="620"></A>then, in another world move naturally also to our centre and its fire to 
<A NAME="621"></A>our circumference. This, however, is impossible, since, if it were true, 
<A NAME="622"></A>earth must, in its own world, move upwards, and fire to the centre; in 
<A NAME="623"></A>the same way the earth of our world must move naturally away from the centre 
<A NAME="624"></A>when it moves towards the centre of another universe. This follows from 
<A NAME="625"></A>the supposed juxtaposition of the worlds. For either we must refuse to 
<A NAME="626"></A>admit the identical nature of the simple bodies in the various universes, 
<A NAME="627"></A>or, admitting this, we must make the centre and the extremity one as suggested. 
<A NAME="628"></A>This being so, it follows that there cannot be more worlds than 
<A NAME="629"></A>one.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>To postulate a difference of nature in the simple bodies according 
<A NAME="631"></A>as they are more or less distant from their proper places is unreasonable. 
<A NAME="632"></A>For what difference can it make whether we say that a thing is this distance 
<A NAME="633"></A>away or that? One would have to suppose a difference proportionate to the 
<A NAME="634"></A>distance and increasing with it, but the form is in fact the same. Moreover, 
<A NAME="635"></A>the bodies must have some movement, since the fact that they move is quite 
<A NAME="636"></A>evident. Are we to say then that all their movements, even those which 
<A NAME="637"></A>are mutually contrary, are due to constraint? No, for a body which has 
<A NAME="638"></A>no natural movement at all cannot be moved by constraint. If then the bodies 
<A NAME="639"></A>have a natural movement, the movement of the particular instances of each 
<A NAME="640"></A>form must necessarily have for goal a place numerically one, i.e. a particular 
<A NAME="641"></A>centre or a particular extremity. If it be suggested that the goal in each 
<A NAME="642"></A>case is one in form but numerically more than one, on the analogy of particulars 
<A NAME="643"></A>which are many though each undifferentiated in form, we reply that the 
<A NAME="644"></A>variety of goal cannot be limited to this portion or that but must extend 
<A NAME="645"></A>to all alike. For all are equally undifferentiated in form, but any one 
<A NAME="646"></A>is different numerically from any other. What I mean is this: if the portions 
<A NAME="647"></A>in this world behave similarly both to one another and to those in another 
<A NAME="648"></A>world, then the portion which is taken hence will not behave differently 
<A NAME="649"></A>either from the portions in another world or from those in the same world, 
<A NAME="650"></A>but similarly to them, since in form no portion differs from another. The 
<A NAME="651"></A>result is that we must either abandon our present assumption or assert 
<A NAME="652"></A>that the centre and the extremity are each numerically one. But this being 
<A NAME="653"></A>so, the heaven, by the same evidence and the same necessary inferences, 
<A NAME="654"></A>must be one only and no more.
<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>A consideration of the other kinds of movement also makes it plain 
<A NAME="656"></A>that there is some point to which earth and fire move naturally. For in 
<A NAME="657"></A>general that which is moved changes from something into something, the 
<A NAME="658"></A>starting-point and the goal being different in form, and always it is a 
<A NAME="659"></A>finite change. For instance, to recover health is to change from disease 
<A NAME="660"></A>to health, to increase is to change from smallness to greatness. Locomotion 
<A NAME="661"></A>must be similar: for it also has its goal and starting-point--and therefore 
<A NAME="662"></A>the starting-point and the goal of the natural movement must differ in 
<A NAME="663"></A>form-just as the movement of coming to health does not take any direction 
<A NAME="664"></A>which chance or the wishes of the mover may select. Thus, too, fire and 
<A NAME="665"></A>earth move not to infinity but to opposite points; and since the opposition 
<A NAME="666"></A>in place is between above and below, these will be the limits of their 
<A NAME="667"></A>movement. (Even in circular movement there is a sort of opposition between 
<A NAME="668"></A>the ends of the diameter, though the movement as a whole has no contrary: 
<A NAME="669"></A>so that here too the movement has in a sense an opposed and finite goal.) 
<A NAME="670"></A>There must therefore be some end to locomotion: it cannot continue to 
<A NAME="671"></A>infinity.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>This conclusion that local movement is not continued to infinity 
<A NAME="673"></A>is corroborated by the fact that earth moves more quickly the nearer it 
<A NAME="674"></A>is to the centre, and fire the nearer it is to the upper place. But if 
<A NAME="675"></A>movement were infinite speed would be infinite also; and if speed then 
<A NAME="676"></A>weight and lightness. For as superior speed in downward movement implies 
<A NAME="677"></A>superior weight, so infinite increase of weight necessitates infinite increase 
<A NAME="678"></A>of speed.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>Further, it is not the action of another body that makes one of 
<A NAME="680"></A>these bodies move up and the other down; nor is it constraint, like the 
<A NAME="681"></A>'extrusion' of some writers. For in that case the larger the mass of fire 
<A NAME="682"></A>or earth the slower would be the upward or downward movement; but the fact 
<A NAME="683"></A>is the reverse: the greater the mass of fire or earth the quicker always 
<A NAME="684"></A>is its movement towards its own place. Again, the speed of the movement 
<A NAME="685"></A>would not increase towards the end if it were due to constraint or extrusion; 
<A NAME="686"></A>for a constrained movement always diminishes in speed as the source of 
<A NAME="687"></A>constraint becomes more distant, and a body moves without constraint to 
<A NAME="688"></A>the place whence it was moved by constraint.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR><BR>A consideration of these points, then, gives adequate assurance 
<A NAME="690"></A>of the truth of our contentions. The same could also be shown with the 
<A NAME="691"></A>aid of the discussions which fall under First Philosophy, as well as from 
<A NAME="692"></A>the nature of the circular movement, which must be eternal both here and 
<A NAME="693"></A>in the other worlds. It is plain, too, from the following considerations 
<A NAME="694"></A>that the universe must be one.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>The bodily elements are three, and therefore the places of the 
<A NAME="696"></A>elements will be three also; the place, first, of the body which sinks 
<A NAME="697"></A>to the bottom, namely the region about the centre; the place, secondly, 
<A NAME="698"></A>of the revolving body, namely the outermost place, and thirdly, the intermediate 
<A NAME="699"></A>place, belonging to the intermediate body. Here in this third place will 
<A NAME="700"></A>be the body which rises to the surface; since, if not here, it will be 
<A NAME="701"></A>elsewhere, and it cannot be elsewhere: for we have two bodies, one weightless, 
<A NAME="702"></A>one endowed with weight, and below is place of the body endowed with weight, 
<A NAME="703"></A>since the region about the centre has been given to the heavy body. And 
<A NAME="704"></A>its position cannot be unnatural to it, for it would have to be natural 
<A NAME="705"></A>to something else, and there is nothing else. It must then occupy the intermediate 
<A NAME="706"></A>place. What distinctions there are within the intermediate itself we will 
<A NAME="707"></A>explain later on.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>We have now said enough to make plain the character and number 
<A NAME="709"></A>of the bodily elements, the place of each, and further, in general, how 
<A NAME="710"></A>many in number the various places are.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="711"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="712"></A><BR><BR>We must show not only that the heaven is one, but also that more 
<A NAME="713"></A>than one heaven is and, further, that, as exempt from decay and generation, 
<A NAME="714"></A>the heaven is eternal. We may begin by raising a difficulty. From one point 
<A NAME="715"></A>of view it might seem impossible that the heaven should be one and unique, 
<A NAME="716"></A>since in all formations and products whether of nature or of art we can 
<A NAME="717"></A>distinguish the shape in itself and the shape in combination with matter. 
<A NAME="718"></A>For instance the form of the sphere is one thing and the gold or bronze 
<A NAME="719"></A>sphere another; the shape of the circle again is one thing, the bronze 
<A NAME="720"></A>or wooden circle another. For when we state the essential nature of the 
<A NAME="721"></A>sphere or circle we do not include in the formula gold or bronze, because 
<A NAME="722"></A>they do not belong to the essence, but if we are speaking of the copper 
<A NAME="723"></A>or gold sphere we do include them. We still make the distinction even if 
<A NAME="724"></A>we cannot conceive or apprehend any other example beside the particular 
<A NAME="725"></A>thing. This may, of course, sometimes be the case: it might be, for instance, 
<A NAME="726"></A>that only one circle could be found; yet none the less the difference will 
<A NAME="727"></A>remain between the being of circle and of this particular circle, the one 
<A NAME="728"></A>being form, the other form in matter, i.e. a particular thing. Now since 
<A NAME="729"></A>the universe is perceptible it must be regarded as a particular; for everything 
<A NAME="730"></A>that is perceptible subsists, as we know, in matter. But if it is a particular, 
<A NAME="731"></A>there will be a distinction between the being of 'this universe' and of 
<A NAME="732"></A>'universe' unqualified. There is a difference, then, between 'this universe' 
<A NAME="733"></A>and simple 'universe'; the second is form and shape, the first form in 
<A NAME="734"></A>combination with matter; and any shape or form has, or may have, more than 
<A NAME="735"></A>one particular instance.
<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR>On the supposition of Forms such as some assert, this must be the 
<A NAME="737"></A>case, and equally on the view that no such entity has a separate existence. 
<A NAME="738"></A>For in every case in which the essence is in matter it is a fact of observation 
<A NAME="739"></A>that the particulars of like form are several or infinite in number. Hence 
<A NAME="740"></A>there either are, or may be, more heavens than one. On these grounds, then, 
<A NAME="741"></A>it might be inferred either that there are or that there might be several 
<A NAME="742"></A>heavens. We must, however, return and ask how much of this argument is 
<A NAME="743"></A>correct and how much not.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR>Now it is quite right to say that the formula of the shape apart 
<A NAME="745"></A>from the matter must be different from that of the shape in the matter, 
<A NAME="746"></A>and we may allow this to be true. We are not, however, therefore compelled 
<A NAME="747"></A>to assert a plurality of worlds. Such a plurality is in fact impossible 
<A NAME="748"></A>if this world contains the entirety of matter, as in fact it does. But 
<A NAME="749"></A>perhaps our contention can be made clearer in this way. Suppose 'aquilinity' 
<A NAME="750"></A>to be curvature in the nose or flesh, and flesh to be the matter of aquilinity. 
<A NAME="751"></A>Suppose further, that all flesh came together into a single whole of flesh 
<A NAME="752"></A>endowed with this aquiline quality. Then neither would there be, nor could 
<A NAME="753"></A>there arise, any other thing that was aquiline. Similarly, suppose flesh 
<A NAME="754"></A>and bones to be the matter of man, and suppose a man to be created of all 
<A NAME="755"></A>flesh and all bones in indissoluble union. The possibility of another man 
<A NAME="756"></A>would be removed. Whatever case you took it would be the same. The general 
<A NAME="757"></A>rule is this: a thing whose essence resides in a substratum of matter can 
<A NAME="758"></A>never come into being in the absence of all matter. Now the universe is 
<A NAME="759"></A>certainly a particular and a material thing: if however, it is composed 
<A NAME="760"></A>not of a part but of the whole of matter, then though the being of 'universe' 
<A NAME="761"></A>and of 'this universe' are still distinct, yet there is no other universe, 
<A NAME="762"></A>and no possibility of others being made, because all the matter is already 
<A NAME="763"></A>included in this. It remains, then, only to prove that it is composed of 
<A NAME="764"></A>all natural perceptible body.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR>First, however, we must explain what we mean by 'heaven' and in 
<A NAME="766"></A>how many senses we use the word, in order to make clearer the object of 
<A NAME="767"></A>our inquiry. (a) In one sense, then, we call 'heaven' the substance of 
<A NAME="768"></A>the extreme circumference of the whole, or that natural body whose place 
<A NAME="769"></A>is at the extreme circumference. We recognize habitually a special right 
<A NAME="770"></A>to the name 'heaven' in the extremity or upper region, which we take to 
<A NAME="771"></A>be the seat of all that is divine. (b) In another sense, we use this name 
<A NAME="772"></A>for the body continuous with the extreme circumference which contains the 
<A NAME="773"></A>moon, the sun, and some of the stars; these we say are 'in the heaven'. 
<A NAME="774"></A>(c) In yet another sense we give the name to all body included within extreme 
<A NAME="775"></A>circumference, since we habitually call the whole or totality 'the heaven'. 
<A NAME="776"></A>The word, then, is used in three senses.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR><BR>Now the whole included within the extreme circumference must be 
<A NAME="778"></A>composed of all physical and sensible body, because there neither is, nor 
<A NAME="779"></A>can come into being, any body outside the heaven. For if there is a natural 
<A NAME="780"></A>body outside the extreme circumference it must be either a simple or a 
<A NAME="781"></A>composite body, and its position must be either natural or unnatural. But 
<A NAME="782"></A>it cannot be any of the simple bodies. For, first, it has been shown that 
<A NAME="783"></A>that which moves in a circle cannot change its place. And, secondly, it 
<A NAME="784"></A>cannot be that which moves from the centre or that which lies lowest. Naturally 
<A NAME="785"></A>they could not be there, since their proper places are elsewhere; and if 
<A NAME="786"></A>these are there unnaturally, the exterior place will be natural to some 
<A NAME="787"></A>other body, since a place which is unnatural to one body must be natural 
<A NAME="788"></A>to another: but we saw that there is no other body besides these. Then 
<A NAME="789"></A>it is not possible that any simple body should be outside the heaven. But, 
<A NAME="790"></A>if no simple body, neither can any mixed body be there: for the presence 
<A NAME="791"></A>of the simple body is involved in the presence of the mixture. Further 
<A NAME="792"></A>neither can any body come into that place: for it will do so either naturally 
<A NAME="793"></A>or unnaturally, and will be either simple or composite; so that the same 
<A NAME="794"></A>argument will apply, since it makes no difference whether the question 
<A NAME="795"></A>is 'does A exist?' or 'could A come to exist?' From our arguments then 
<A NAME="796"></A>it is evident not only that there is not, but also that there could never 
<A NAME="797"></A>come to be, any bodily mass whatever outside the circumference. The world 
<A NAME="798"></A>as a whole, therefore, includes all its appropriate matter, which is, as 
<A NAME="799"></A>we saw, natural perceptible body. So that neither are there now, nor have 
<A NAME="800"></A>there ever been, nor can there ever be formed more heavens than one, but 
<A NAME="801"></A>this heaven of ours is one and unique and complete.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>It is therefore evident that there is also no place or void or 
<A NAME="803"></A>time outside the heaven. For in every place body can be present; and void 
<A NAME="804"></A>is said to be that in which the presence of body, though not actual, is 
<A NAME="805"></A>possible; and time is the number of movement. But in the absence of natural 
<A NAME="806"></A>body there is no movement, and outside the heaven, as we have shown, body 
<A NAME="807"></A>neither exists nor can come to exist. It is clear then that there is neither 
<A NAME="808"></A>place, nor void, nor time, outside the heaven. Hence whatever is there, 
<A NAME="809"></A>is of such a nature as not to occupy any place, nor does time age it; nor 
<A NAME="810"></A>is there any change in any of the things which lie beyond the outermost 
<A NAME="811"></A>motion; they continue through their entire duration unalterable and unmodified, 
<A NAME="812"></A>living the best and most selfsufficient of lives. As a matter of fact, 
<A NAME="813"></A>this word 'duration' possessed a divine significance for the ancients, 
<A NAME="814"></A>for the fulfilment which includes the period of life of any creature, outside 
<A NAME="815"></A>of which no natural development can fall, has been called its duration. 
<A NAME="816"></A>On the same principle the fulfilment of the whole heaven, the fulfilment 
<A NAME="817"></A>which includes all time and infinity, is 'duration'-a name based upon the 
<A NAME="818"></A>fact that it is always-duration immortal and divine. From it derive the 
<A NAME="819"></A>being and life which other things, some more or less articulately but others 
<A NAME="820"></A>feebly, enjoy. So, too, in its discussions concerning the divine, popular 
<A NAME="821"></A>philosophy often propounds the view that whatever is divine, whatever is 
<A NAME="822"></A>primary and supreme, is necessarily unchangeable. This fact confirms what 
<A NAME="823"></A>we have said. For there is nothing else stronger than it to move it-since 
<A NAME="824"></A>that would mean more divine-and it has no defect and lacks none of its 
<A NAME="825"></A>proper excellences. Its unceasing movement, then, is also reasonable, since 
<A NAME="826"></A>everything ceases to move when it comes to its proper place, but the body 
<A NAME="827"></A>whose path is the circle has one and the same place for starting-point 
<A NAME="828"></A>and goal.

<A NAME="829"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="830"></A><BR><BR>Having established these distinctions, we may now proceed to the 
<A NAME="831"></A>question whether the heaven is ungenerated or generated, indestructible 
<A NAME="832"></A>or destructible. Let us start with a review of the theories of other thinkers; 
<A NAME="833"></A>for the proofs of a theory are difficulties for the contrary theory. Besides, 
<A NAME="834"></A>those who have first heard the pleas of our adversaries will be more likely 
<A NAME="835"></A>to credit the assertions which we are going to make. We shall be less open 
<A NAME="836"></A>to the charge of procuring judgement by default. To give a satisfactory 
<A NAME="837"></A>decision as to the truth it is necessary to be rather an arbitrator than 
<A NAME="838"></A>a party to the dispute.
<A NAME="839"></A><BR><BR>That the world was generated all are agreed, but, generation over, 
<A NAME="840"></A>some say that it is eternal, others say that it is destructible like any 
<A NAME="841"></A>other natural formation. Others again, with Empedliocles of Acragas and 
<A NAME="842"></A>Heraclitus of Ephesus, believe that there is alternation in the destructive 
<A NAME="843"></A>process, which takes now this direction, now that, and continues without 
<A NAME="844"></A>end.
<A NAME="845"></A><BR><BR>Now to assert that it was generated and yet is eternal is to assert 
<A NAME="846"></A>the impossible; for we cannot reasonably attribute to anything any characteristics 
<A NAME="847"></A>but those which observation detects in many or all instances. But in this 
<A NAME="848"></A>case the facts point the other way: generated things are seen always to 
<A NAME="849"></A>be destroyed. Further, a thing whose present state had no beginning and 
<A NAME="850"></A>which could not have been other than it was at any previous moment throughout 
<A NAME="851"></A>its entire duration, cannot possibly be changed. For there will have to 
<A NAME="852"></A>be some cause of change, and if this had been present earlier it would 
<A NAME="853"></A>have made possible another condition of that to which any other condition 
<A NAME="854"></A>was impossible. Suppose that the world was formed out of elements which 
<A NAME="855"></A>were formerly otherwise conditioned than as they are now. Then (1) if their 
<A NAME="856"></A>condition was always so and could not have been otherwise, the world could 
<A NAME="857"></A>never have come into being. And (2) if the world did come into being, then, 
<A NAME="858"></A>clearly, their condition must have been capable of change and not eternal: 
<A NAME="859"></A>after combination therefore they will be dispersed, just as in the past 
<A NAME="860"></A>after dispersion they came into combination, and this process either has 
<A NAME="861"></A>been, or could have been, indefinitely repeated. But if this is so, the 
<A NAME="862"></A>world cannot be indestructible, and it does not matter whether the change 
<A NAME="863"></A>of condition has actually occurred or remains a possibility.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR><BR>Some of those who hold that the world, though indestructible, was 
<A NAME="865"></A>yet generated, try to support their case by a parallel which is illusory. 
<A NAME="866"></A>They say that in their statements about its generation they are doing what 
<A NAME="867"></A>geometricians do when they construct their figures, not implying that the 
<A NAME="868"></A>universe really had a beginning, but for didactic reasons facilitating 
<A NAME="869"></A>understanding by exhibiting the object, like the figure, as in course of 
<A NAME="870"></A>formation. The two cases, as we said, are not parallel; for, in the construction 
<A NAME="871"></A>of the figure, when the various steps are completed the required figure 
<A NAME="872"></A>forthwith results; but in these other demonstrations what results is not 
<A NAME="873"></A>that which was required. Indeed it cannot be so; for antecedent and consequent, 
<A NAME="874"></A>as assumed, are in contradiction. The ordered, it is said, arose out of 
<A NAME="875"></A>the unordered; and the same thing cannot be at the same time both ordered 
<A NAME="876"></A>and unordered; there must be a process and a lapse of time separating the 
<A NAME="877"></A>two states. In the figure, on the other hand, there is no temporal separation. 
<A NAME="878"></A>It is clear then that the universe cannot be at once eternal and 
<A NAME="879"></A>generated.
<A NAME="880"></A><BR><BR>To say that the universe alternately combines and dissolves is 
<A NAME="881"></A>no more paradoxical than to make it eternal but varying in shape. It is 
<A NAME="882"></A>as if one were to think that there was now destruction and now existence 
<A NAME="883"></A>when from a child a man is generated, and from a man a child. For it is 
<A NAME="884"></A>clear that when the elements come together the result is not a chance system 
<A NAME="885"></A>and combination, but the very same as before-especially on the view of 
<A NAME="886"></A>those who hold this theory, since they say that the contrary is the cause 
<A NAME="887"></A>of each state. So that if the totality of body, which is a continuum, is 
<A NAME="888"></A>now in this order or disposition and now in that, and if the combination 
<A NAME="889"></A>of the whole is a world or heaven, then it will not be the world that comes 
<A NAME="890"></A>into being and is destroyed, but only its dispositions.
<A NAME="891"></A><BR><BR>If the world is believed to be one, it is impossible to suppose 
<A NAME="892"></A>that it should be, as a whole, first generated and then destroyed, never 
<A NAME="893"></A>to reappear; since before it came into being there was always present the 
<A NAME="894"></A>combination prior to it, and that, we hold, could never change if it was 
<A NAME="895"></A>never generated. If, on the other hand, the worlds are infinite in number 
<A NAME="896"></A>the view is more plausible. But whether this is, or is not, impossible 
<A NAME="897"></A>will be clear from what follows. For there are some who think it possible 
<A NAME="898"></A>both for the ungenerated to be destroyed and for the generated to persist 
<A NAME="899"></A>undestroyed. (This is held in the Timaeus, where Plato says that the heaven, 
<A NAME="900"></A>though it was generated, will none the less exist to eternity.) So far 
<A NAME="901"></A>as the heaven is concerned we have answered this view with arguments appropriate 
<A NAME="902"></A>to the nature of the heaven: on the general question we shall attain clearness 
<A NAME="903"></A>when we examine the matter universally.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="904"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="905"></A><BR><BR>We must first distinguish the senses in which we use the words 
<A NAME="906"></A>'ungenerated' and 'generated', 'destructible' and 'indestructible'. These 
<A NAME="907"></A>have many meanings, and though it may make no difference to the argument, 
<A NAME="908"></A>yet some confusion of mind must result from treating as uniform in its 
<A NAME="909"></A>use a word which has several distinct applications. The character which 
<A NAME="910"></A>is the ground of the predication will always remain 
<A NAME="911"></A>obscure.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR>The word 'ungenerated' then is used (a) in one sense whenever something 
<A NAME="913"></A>now is which formerly was not, no process of becoming or change being involved. 
<A NAME="914"></A>Such is the case, according to some, with contact and motion, since there 
<A NAME="915"></A>is no process of coming to be in contact or in motion. (b) It is used in 
<A NAME="916"></A>another sense, when something which is capable of coming to be, with or 
<A NAME="917"></A>without process, does not exist; such a thing is ungenerated in the sense 
<A NAME="918"></A>that its generation is not a fact but a possibility. (c) It is also applied 
<A NAME="919"></A>where there is general impossibility of any generation such that the thing 
<A NAME="920"></A>now is which then was not. And 'impossibility' has two uses: first, where 
<A NAME="921"></A>it is untrue to say that the thing can ever come into being, and secondly, 
<A NAME="922"></A>where it cannot do so easily, quickly, or well. In the same way the word 
<A NAME="923"></A>'generated' is used, (a) first, where what formerly was not afterwards 
<A NAME="924"></A>is, whether a process of becoming was or was not involved, so long as that 
<A NAME="925"></A>which then was not, now is; (b) secondly, of anything capable of existing, 
<A NAME="926"></A>'capable' being defined with reference either to truth or to facility; 
<A NAME="927"></A>(c) thirdly, of anything to which the passage from not being to being belongs, 
<A NAME="928"></A>whether already actual, if its existence is due to a past process of becoming, 
<A NAME="929"></A>or not yet actual but only possible. The uses of the words 'destructible' 
<A NAME="930"></A>and 'indestructible' are similar. 'Destructible' is applied (a) to that 
<A NAME="931"></A>which formerly was and afterwards either is not or might not be, whether 
<A NAME="932"></A>a period of being destroyed and changed intervenes or not; and (b) sometimes 
<A NAME="933"></A>we apply the word to that which a process of destruction may cause not 
<A NAME="934"></A>to be; and also (c) in a third sense, to that which is easily destructible, 
<A NAME="935"></A>to the 'easily destroyed', so to speak. Of the indestructible the same 
<A NAME="936"></A>account holds good. It is either (a) that which now is and now is not, 
<A NAME="937"></A>without any process of destruction, like contact, which without being destroyed 
<A NAME="938"></A>afterwards is not, though formerly it was; or (b) that which is but might 
<A NAME="939"></A>not be, or which will at some time not be, though it now is. For you exist 
<A NAME="940"></A>now and so does the contact; yet both are destructible, because a time 
<A NAME="941"></A>will come when it will not be true of you that you exist, nor of these 
<A NAME="942"></A>things that they are in contact. Thirdly (c) in its most proper use, it 
<A NAME="943"></A>is that which is, but is incapable of any destruction such that the thing 
<A NAME="944"></A>which now is later ceases to be or might cease to be; or again, that which 
<A NAME="945"></A>has not yet been destroyed, but in the future may cease to be. For indestructible 
<A NAME="946"></A>is also used of that which is destroyed with difficulty.
<A NAME="947"></A><BR><BR>This being so, we must ask what we mean by 'possible' and 'impossible'. 
<A NAME="948"></A>For in its most proper use the predicate 'indestructible' is given because 
<A NAME="949"></A>it is impossible that the thing should be destroyed, i.e. exist at one 
<A NAME="950"></A>time and not at another. And 'ungenerated' also involves impossibility 
<A NAME="951"></A>when used for that which cannot be generated, in such fashion that, while 
<A NAME="952"></A>formerly it was not, later it is. An instance is a commensurable diagonal. 
<A NAME="953"></A>Now when we speak of a power to move or to lift weights, we refer always 
<A NAME="954"></A>to the maximum. We speak, for instance, of a power to lift a hundred talents 
<A NAME="955"></A>or walk a hundred stades-though a power to effect the maximum is also a 
<A NAME="956"></A>power to effect any part of the maximum-since we feel obliged in defining 
<A NAME="957"></A>the power to give the limit or maximum. A thing, then, which is within 
<A NAME="958"></A>it. If, for example, a man can lift a hundred talents, he can also lift 
<A NAME="959"></A>two, and if he can walk a hundred stades, he can also walk two. But the 
<A NAME="960"></A>power is of the maximum, and a thing said, with reference to its maximum, 
<A NAME="961"></A>to be incapable of so much is also incapable of any greater amount. It 
<A NAME="962"></A>is, for instance, clear that a person who cannot walk a thousand stades 
<A NAME="963"></A>will also be unable to walk a thousand and one. This point need not trouble 
<A NAME="964"></A>us, for we may take it as settled that what is, in the strict sense, possible 
<A NAME="965"></A>is determined by a limiting maximum. Now perhaps the objection might be 
<A NAME="966"></A>raised that there is no necessity in this, since he who sees a stade need 
<A NAME="967"></A>not see the smaller measures contained in it, while, on the contrary, he 
<A NAME="968"></A>who can see a dot or hear a small sound will perceive what is greater. 
<A NAME="969"></A>This, however, does not touch our argument. The maximum may be determined 
<A NAME="970"></A>either in the power or in its object. The application of this is plain. 
<A NAME="971"></A>Superior sight is sight of the smaller body, but superior speed is that 
<A NAME="972"></A>of the greater body.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="973"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="974"></A><BR><BR>Having established these distinctions we car now proceed to the 
<A NAME="975"></A>sequel. If there are thing! capable both of being and of not being, there 
<A NAME="976"></A>must be some definite maximum time of their being and not being; a time, 
<A NAME="977"></A>I mean, during which continued existence is possible to them and a time 
<A NAME="978"></A>during which continued nonexistence is possible. And this is true in every 
<A NAME="979"></A>category, whether the thing is, for example, 'man', or 'white', or 'three 
<A NAME="980"></A>cubits long', or whatever it may be. For if the time is not definite in 
<A NAME="981"></A>quantity, but longer than any that can be suggested and shorter than none, 
<A NAME="982"></A>then it will be possible for one and the same thing to exist for infinite 
<A NAME="983"></A>time and not to exist for another infinity. This, however, is 
<A NAME="984"></A>impossible.
<A NAME="985"></A><BR><BR>Let us take our start from this point. The impossible and the false 
<A NAME="986"></A>have not the same significance. One use of 'impossible' and 'possible', 
<A NAME="987"></A>and 'false' and 'true', is hypothetical. It is impossible, for instance, 
<A NAME="988"></A>on a certain hypothesis that the triangle should have its angles equal 
<A NAME="989"></A>to two right angles, and on another the diagonal is commensurable. But 
<A NAME="990"></A>there are also things possible and impossible, false and true, absolutely. 
<A NAME="991"></A>Now it is one thing to be absolutely false, and another thing to be absolutely 
<A NAME="992"></A>impossible. To say that you are standing when you are not standing is to 
<A NAME="993"></A>assert a falsehood, but not an impossibility. Similarly to say that a man 
<A NAME="994"></A>who is playing the harp, but not singing, is singing, is to say what is 
<A NAME="995"></A>false but not impossible. To say, however, that you are at once standing 
<A NAME="996"></A>and sitting, or that the diagonal is commensurable, is to say what is not 
<A NAME="997"></A>only false but also impossible. Thus it is not the same thing to make a 
<A NAME="998"></A>false and to make an impossible hypothesis, and from the impossible hypothesis 
<A NAME="999"></A>impossible results follow. A man has, it is true, the capacity at once 
<A NAME="1000"></A>of sitting and of standing, because when he possesses the one he also possesses 
<A NAME="1001"></A>the other; but it does not follow that he can at once sit and stand, only 
<A NAME="1002"></A>that at another time he can do the other also. But if a thing has for infinite 
<A NAME="1003"></A>time more than one capacity, another time is impossible and the times must 
<A NAME="1004"></A>coincide. Thus if a thing which exists for infinite time is destructible, 
<A NAME="1005"></A>it will have the capacity of not being. Now if it exists for infinite time 
<A NAME="1006"></A>let this capacity be actualized; and it will be in actuality at once existent 
<A NAME="1007"></A>and non-existent. Thus a false conclusion would follow because a false 
<A NAME="1008"></A>assumption was made, but if what was assumed had not been impossible its 
<A NAME="1009"></A>consequence would not have been impossible.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR><BR>Anything then which always exists is absolutely imperishable. It 
<A NAME="1011"></A>is also ungenerated, since if it was generated it will have the power for 
<A NAME="1012"></A>some time of not being. For as that which formerly was, but now is not, 
<A NAME="1013"></A>or is capable at some future time of not being, is destructible, so that 
<A NAME="1014"></A>which is capable of formerly not having been is generated. But in the case 
<A NAME="1015"></A>of that which always is, there is no time for such a capacity of not being, 
<A NAME="1016"></A>whether the supposed time is finite or infinite; for its capacity of being 
<A NAME="1017"></A>must include the finite time since it covers infinite 
<A NAME="1018"></A>time.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR><BR>It is therefore impossible that one and the same thing should be 
<A NAME="1020"></A>capable of always existing and of always not-existing. And 'not always 
<A NAME="1021"></A>existing', the contradictory, is also excluded. Thus it is impossible for 
<A NAME="1022"></A>a thing always to exist and yet to be destructible. Nor, similarly, can 
<A NAME="1023"></A>it be generated. For of two attributes if B cannot be present without A, 
<A NAME="1024"></A>the impossibility A of proves the impossibility of B. What always is, then, 
<A NAME="1025"></A>since it is incapable of ever not being, cannot possibly be generated. 
<A NAME="1026"></A>But since the contradictory of 'that which is always capable of being' 
<A NAME="1027"></A>'that which is not always capable of being'; while 'that which is always 
<A NAME="1028"></A>capable of not being' is the contrary, whose contradictory in turn is 'that 
<A NAME="1029"></A>which is not always capable of not being', it is necessary that the contradictories 
<A NAME="1030"></A>of both terms should be predicable of one and the same thing, and thus 
<A NAME="1031"></A>that, intermediate between what always is and what always is not, there 
<A NAME="1032"></A>should be that to which being and not-being are both possible; for the 
<A NAME="1033"></A>contradictory of each will at times be true of it unless it always exists. 
<A NAME="1034"></A>Hence that which not always is not will sometimes be and sometimes not 
<A NAME="1035"></A>be; and it is clear that this is true also of that which cannot always 
<A NAME="1036"></A>be but sometimes is and therefore sometimes is not. One thing, then, will 
<A NAME="1037"></A>have the power of being, and will thus be intermediate between the other 
<A NAME="1038"></A>two.
<A NAME="1039"></A><BR><BR>Expresed universally our argument is as follows. Let there be two 
<A NAME="1040"></A>attributes, A and B, not capable of being present in any one thing together, 
<A NAME="1041"></A>while either A or C and either B or D are capable of being present in everything. 
<A NAME="1042"></A>Then C and D must be predicated of everything of which neither A nor B 
<A NAME="1043"></A>is predicated. Let E lie between A and B; for that which is neither of 
<A NAME="1044"></A>two contraries is a mean between them. In E both C and D must be present, 
<A NAME="1045"></A>for either A or C is present everywhere and therefore in E. Since then 
<A NAME="1046"></A>A is impossible, C must be present, and the same argument holds of 
<A NAME="1047"></A>D.
<A NAME="1048"></A><BR><BR>Neither that which always is, therefore, nor that which always 
<A NAME="1049"></A>is not is either generated or destructible. And clearly whatever is generated 
<A NAME="1050"></A>or destructible is not eternal. If it were, it would be at once capable 
<A NAME="1051"></A>of always being and capable of not always being, but it has already been 
<A NAME="1052"></A>shown that this is impossible. Surely then whatever is ungenerated and 
<A NAME="1053"></A>in being must be eternal, and whatever is indestructible and in being must 
<A NAME="1054"></A>equally be so. (I use the words 'ungenerated' and 'indestructible' in their 
<A NAME="1055"></A>proper sense, 'ungenerated' for that which now is and could not at any 
<A NAME="1056"></A>previous time have been truly said not to be; 'indestructible' for that 
<A NAME="1057"></A>which now is and cannot at any future time be truly said not to be.) If, 
<A NAME="1058"></A>again, the two terms are coincident, if the ungenerated is indestructible, 
<A NAME="1059"></A>and the indestructible ungenearted, then each of them is coincident with 
<A NAME="1060"></A>'eternal'; anything ungenerated is eternal and anything indestructible 
<A NAME="1061"></A>is eternal. This is clear too from the definition of the terms, Whatever 
<A NAME="1062"></A>is destructible must be generated; for it is either ungenerated, or generated, 
<A NAME="1063"></A>but, if ungenerated, it is by hypothesis indestructible. Whatever, further, 
<A NAME="1064"></A>is generated must be destructible. For it is either destructible or indestructible, 
<A NAME="1065"></A>but, if indestructible, it is by hypothesis ungenerated.
<A NAME="1066"></A><BR><BR>If, however, 'indestructible' and 'ungenerated' are not coincident, 
<A NAME="1067"></A>there is no necessity that either the ungenerated or the indestructible 
<A NAME="1068"></A>should be eternal. But they must be coincident, for the following reasons. 
<A NAME="1069"></A>The terms 'generated' and 'destructible' are coincident; this is obvious 
<A NAME="1070"></A>from our former remarks, since between what always is and what always is 
<A NAME="1071"></A>not there is an intermediate which is neither, and that intermediate is 
<A NAME="1072"></A>the generated and destructible. For whatever is either of these is capable 
<A NAME="1073"></A>both of being and of not being for a definite time: in either case, I mean, 
<A NAME="1074"></A>there is a certain period of time during which the thing is and another 
<A NAME="1075"></A>during which it is not. Anything therefore which is generated or destructible 
<A NAME="1076"></A>must be intermediate. Now let A be that which always is and B that which 
<A NAME="1077"></A>always is not, C the generated, and D the destructible. Then C must be 
<A NAME="1078"></A>intermediate between A and B. For in their case there is no time in the 
<A NAME="1079"></A>direction of either limit, in which either A is not or B is. But for the 
<A NAME="1080"></A>generated there must be such a time either actually or potentially, though 
<A NAME="1081"></A>not for A and B in either way. C then will be, and also not be, for a limited 
<A NAME="1082"></A>length of time, and this is true also of D, the destructible. Therefore 
<A NAME="1083"></A>each is both generated and destructible. Therefore 'generated' and 'destructible' 
<A NAME="1084"></A>are coincident. Now let E stand for the ungenerated, F for the generated, 
<A NAME="1085"></A>G for the indestructible, and H for the destructible. As for F and H, it 
<A NAME="1086"></A>has been shown that they are coincident. But when terms stand to one another 
<A NAME="1087"></A>as these do, F and H coincident,
