<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part I</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Every state is a community of some kind, and every community is established 
<A NAME="12"></A>with a view to some good; for mankind always act in order to obtain that 
<A NAME="13"></A>which they think good. But, if all communities aim at some good, the state 
<A NAME="14"></A>or political community, which is the highest of all, and which embraces 
<A NAME="15"></A>all the rest, aims at good in a greater degree than any other, and at the 
<A NAME="16"></A>highest good.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>Some people think that the qualifications of a statesman, king, 
<A NAME="18"></A>householder, and master are the same, and that they differ, not in kind, 
<A NAME="19"></A>but only in the number of their subjects. For example, the ruler over a 
<A NAME="20"></A>few is called a master; over more, the manager of a household; over a still 
<A NAME="21"></A>larger number, a statesman or king, as if there were no difference between 
<A NAME="22"></A>a great household and a small state. The distinction which is made between 
<A NAME="23"></A>the king and the statesman is as follows: When the government is personal, 
<A NAME="24"></A>the ruler is a king; when, according to the rules of the political science, 
<A NAME="25"></A>the citizens rule and are ruled in turn, then he is called a 
<A NAME="26"></A>statesman.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>But all this is a mistake; for governments differ in kind, as will 
<A NAME="28"></A>be evident to any one who considers the matter according to the method 
<A NAME="29"></A>which has hitherto guided us. As in other departments of science, so in 
<A NAME="30"></A>politics, the compound should always be resolved into the simple elements 
<A NAME="31"></A>or least parts of the whole. We must therefore look at the elements of 
<A NAME="32"></A>which the state is composed, in order that we may see in what the different 
<A NAME="33"></A>kinds of rule differ from one another, and whether any scientific result 
<A NAME="34"></A>can be attained about each one of them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="35"></A><B>Part II</B>

<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>He who thus considers things in their first growth and origin, 
<A NAME="37"></A>whether a state or anything else, will obtain the clearest view of them. 
<A NAME="38"></A>In the first place there must be a union of those who cannot exist without 
<A NAME="39"></A>each other; namely, of male and female, that the race may continue (and 
<A NAME="40"></A>this is a union which is formed, not of deliberate purpose, but because, 
<A NAME="41"></A>in common with other animals and with plants, mankind have a natural desire 
<A NAME="42"></A>to leave behind them an image of themselves), and of natural ruler and 
<A NAME="43"></A>subject, that both may be preserved. For that which can foresee by the 
<A NAME="44"></A>exercise of mind is by nature intended to be lord and master, and that 
<A NAME="45"></A>which can with its body give effect to such foresight is a subject, and 
<A NAME="46"></A>by nature a slave; hence master and slave have the same interest. Now nature 
<A NAME="47"></A>has distinguished between the female and the slave. For she is not niggardly, 
<A NAME="48"></A>like the smith who fashions the Delphian knife for many uses; she makes 
<A NAME="49"></A>each thing for a single use, and every instrument is best made when intended 
<A NAME="50"></A>for one and not for many uses. But among barbarians no distinction is made 
<A NAME="51"></A>between women and slaves, because there is no natural ruler among them: 
<A NAME="52"></A>they are a community of slaves, male and female. Wherefore the poets say, 
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>"It is meet that Hellenes should rule over barbarians; 
<A NAME="54"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="55"></A>as if they thought that the barbarian and the slave were by nature 
<A NAME="56"></A>one.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>Out of these two relationships between man and woman, master and 
<A NAME="58"></A>slave, the first thing to arise is the family, and Hesiod is right when 
<A NAME="59"></A>he says, <BR><BR>"First house and wife and an ox for the plough, 
<A NAME="60"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="61"></A>for the ox is the poor man's slave. The family is the association established 
<A NAME="62"></A>by nature for the supply of men's everyday wants, and the members of it 
<A NAME="63"></A>are called by Charondas 'companions of the cupboard,' and by Epimenides 
<A NAME="64"></A>the Cretan, 'companions of the manger.' But when several families are united, 
<A NAME="65"></A>and the association aims at something more than the supply of daily needs, 
<A NAME="66"></A>the first society to be formed is the village. And the most natural form 
<A NAME="67"></A>of the village appears to be that of a colony from the family, composed 
<A NAME="68"></A>of the children and grandchildren, who are said to be suckled 'with the 
<A NAME="69"></A>same milk.' And this is the reason why Hellenic states were originally 
<A NAME="70"></A>governed by kings; because the Hellenes were under royal rule before they 
<A NAME="71"></A>came together, as the barbarians still are. Every family is ruled by the 
<A NAME="72"></A>eldest, and therefore in the colonies of the family the kingly form of 
<A NAME="73"></A>government prevailed because they were of the same blood. As Homer says: 
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>"Each one gives law to his children and to his wives. 
<A NAME="75"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="76"></A>For they lived dispersedly, as was the manner in ancient times. Wherefore 
<A NAME="77"></A>men say that the Gods have a king, because they themselves either are or 
<A NAME="78"></A>were in ancient times under the rule of a king. For they imagine, not only 
<A NAME="79"></A>the forms of the Gods, but their ways of life to be like their 
<A NAME="80"></A>own.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>When several villages are united in a single complete community, 
<A NAME="82"></A>large enough to be nearly or quite self-sufficing, the state comes into 
<A NAME="83"></A>existence, originating in the bare needs of life, and continuing in existence 
<A NAME="84"></A>for the sake of a good life. And therefore, if the earlier forms of society 
<A NAME="85"></A>are natural, so is the state, for it is the end of them, and the nature 
<A NAME="86"></A>of a thing is its end. For what each thing is when fully developed, we 
<A NAME="87"></A>call its nature, whether we are speaking of a man, a horse, or a family. 
<A NAME="88"></A>Besides, the final cause and end of a thing is the best, and to be self-sufficing 
<A NAME="89"></A>is the end and the best.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>Hence it is evident that the state is a creation of nature, and 
<A NAME="91"></A>that man is by nature a political animal. And he who by nature and not 
<A NAME="92"></A>by mere accident is without a state, is either a bad man or above humanity; 
<A NAME="93"></A>he is like the <BR><BR>"Tribeless, lawless, hearthless one, 
<A NAME="94"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="95"></A>whom Homer denounces- the natural outcast is forthwith a lover of war; 
<A NAME="96"></A>he may be compared to an isolated piece at draughts.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>Now, that man is more of a political animal than bees or any other 
<A NAME="98"></A>gregarious animals is evident. Nature, as we often say, makes nothing in 
<A NAME="99"></A>vain, and man is the only animal whom she has endowed with the gift of 
<A NAME="100"></A>speech. And whereas mere voice is but an indication of pleasure or pain, 
<A NAME="101"></A>and is therefore found in other animals (for their nature attains to the 
<A NAME="102"></A>perception of pleasure and pain and the intimation of them to one another, 
<A NAME="103"></A>and no further), the power of speech is intended to set forth the expedient 
<A NAME="104"></A>and inexpedient, and therefore likewise the just and the unjust. And it 
<A NAME="105"></A>is a characteristic of man that he alone has any sense of good and evil, 
<A NAME="106"></A>of just and unjust, and the like, and the association of living beings 
<A NAME="107"></A>who have this sense makes a family and a state.
<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>Further, the state is by nature clearly prior to the family and 
<A NAME="109"></A>to the individual, since the whole is of necessity prior to the part; for 
<A NAME="110"></A>example, if the whole body be destroyed, there will be no foot or hand, 
<A NAME="111"></A>except in an equivocal sense, as we might speak of a stone hand; for when 
<A NAME="112"></A>destroyed the hand will be no better than that. But things are defined 
<A NAME="113"></A>by their working and power; and we ought not to say that they are the same 
<A NAME="114"></A>when they no longer have their proper quality, but only that they have 
<A NAME="115"></A>the same name. The proof that the state is a creation of nature and prior 
<A NAME="116"></A>to the individual is that the individual, when isolated, is not self-sufficing; 
<A NAME="117"></A>and therefore he is like a part in relation to the whole. But he who is 
<A NAME="118"></A>unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient 
<A NAME="119"></A>for himself, must be either a beast or a god: he is no part of a state. 
<A NAME="120"></A>A social instinct is implanted in all men by nature, and yet he who first 
<A NAME="121"></A>founded the state was the greatest of benefactors. For man, when perfected, 
<A NAME="122"></A>is the best of animals, but, when separated from law and justice, he is 
<A NAME="123"></A>the worst of all; since armed injustice is the more dangerous, and he is 
<A NAME="124"></A>equipped at birth with arms, meant to be used by intelligence and virtue, 
<A NAME="125"></A>which he may use for the worst ends. Wherefore, if he have not virtue, 
<A NAME="126"></A>he is the most unholy and the most savage of animals, and the most full 
<A NAME="127"></A>of lust and gluttony. But justice is the bond of men in states, for the 
<A NAME="128"></A>administration of justice, which is the determination of what is just, 
<A NAME="129"></A>is the principle of order in political society.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="130"></A><B>Part III</B>

<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>Seeing then that the state is made up of households, before speaking 
<A NAME="132"></A>of the state we must speak of the management of the household. The parts 
<A NAME="133"></A>of household management correspond to the persons who compose the household, 
<A NAME="134"></A>and a complete household consists of slaves and freemen. Now we should 
<A NAME="135"></A>begin by examining everything in its fewest possible elements; and the 
<A NAME="136"></A>first and fewest possible parts of a family are master and slave, husband 
<A NAME="137"></A>and wife, father and children. We have therefore to consider what each 
<A NAME="138"></A>of these three relations is and ought to be: I mean the relation of master 
<A NAME="139"></A>and servant, the marriage relation (the conjunction of man and wife has 
<A NAME="140"></A>no name of its own), and thirdly, the procreative relation (this also has 
<A NAME="141"></A>no proper name). And there is another element of a household, the so-called 
<A NAME="142"></A>art of getting wealth, which, according to some, is identical with household 
<A NAME="143"></A>management, according to others, a principal part of it; the nature of 
<A NAME="144"></A>this art will also have to be considered by us.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>Let us first speak of master and slave, looking to the needs of 
<A NAME="146"></A>practical life and also seeking to attain some better theory of their relation 
<A NAME="147"></A>than exists at present. For some are of opinion that the rule of a master 
<A NAME="148"></A>is a science, and that the management of a household, and the mastership 
<A NAME="149"></A>of slaves, and the political and royal rule, as I was saying at the outset, 
<A NAME="150"></A>are all the same. Others affirm that the rule of a master over slaves is 
<A NAME="151"></A>contrary to nature, and that the distinction between slave and freeman 
<A NAME="152"></A>exists by law only, and not by nature; and being an interference with nature 
<A NAME="153"></A>is therefore unjust.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="154"></A><B>Part IV</B>

<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Property is a part of the household, and the art of acquiring property 
<A NAME="156"></A>is a part of the art of managing the household; for no man can live well, 
<A NAME="157"></A>or indeed live at all, unless he be provided with necessaries. And as in 
<A NAME="158"></A>the arts which have a definite sphere the workers must have their own proper 
<A NAME="159"></A>instruments for the accomplishment of their work, so it is in the management 
<A NAME="160"></A>of a household. Now instruments are of various sorts; some are living, 
<A NAME="161"></A>others lifeless; in the rudder, the pilot of a ship has a lifeless, in 
<A NAME="162"></A>the look-out man, a living instrument; for in the arts the servant is a 
<A NAME="163"></A>kind of instrument. Thus, too, a possession is an instrument for maintaining 
<A NAME="164"></A>life. And so, in the arrangement of the family, a slave is a living possession, 
<A NAME="165"></A>and property a number of such instruments; and the servant is himself an 
<A NAME="166"></A>instrument which takes precedence of all other instruments. For if every 
<A NAME="167"></A>instrument could accomplish its own work, obeying or anticipating the will 
<A NAME="168"></A>of others, like the statues of Daedalus, or the tripods of Hephaestus, 
<A NAME="169"></A>which, says the poet, <BR><BR>"of their own accord entered the assembly 
<A NAME="170"></A>of the Gods; "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="171"></A>if, in like manner, the shuttle would weave and the plectrum touch the 
<A NAME="172"></A>lyre without a hand to guide them, chief workmen would not want servants, 
<A NAME="173"></A>nor masters slaves. Here, however, another distinction must be drawn; the 
<A NAME="174"></A>instruments commonly so called are instruments of production, whilst a 
<A NAME="175"></A>possession is an instrument of action. The shuttle, for example, is not 
<A NAME="176"></A>only of use; but something else is made by it, whereas of a garment or 
<A NAME="177"></A>of a bed there is only the use. Further, as production and action are different 
<A NAME="178"></A>in kind, and both require instruments, the instruments which they employ 
<A NAME="179"></A>must likewise differ in kind. But life is action and not production, and 
<A NAME="180"></A>therefore the slave is the minister of action. Again, a possession is spoken 
<A NAME="181"></A>of as a part is spoken of; for the part is not only a part of something 
<A NAME="182"></A>else, but wholly belongs to it; and this is also true of a possession. 
<A NAME="183"></A>The master is only the master of the slave; he does not belong to him, 
<A NAME="184"></A>whereas the slave is not only the slave of his master, but wholly belongs 
<A NAME="185"></A>to him. Hence we see what is the nature and office of a slave; he who is 
<A NAME="186"></A>by nature not his own but another's man, is by nature a slave; and he may 
<A NAME="187"></A>be said to be another's man who, being a human being, is also a possession. 
<A NAME="188"></A>And a possession may be defined as an instrument of action, separable from 
<A NAME="189"></A>the possessor.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="190"></A><B>Part V</B>

<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>But is there any one thus intended by nature to be a slave, and 
<A NAME="192"></A>for whom such a condition is expedient and right, or rather is not all 
<A NAME="193"></A>slavery a violation of nature?
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>There is no difficulty in answering this question, on grounds both 
<A NAME="195"></A>of reason and of fact. For that some should rule and others be ruled is 
<A NAME="196"></A>a thing not only necessary, but expedient; from the hour of their birth, 
<A NAME="197"></A>some are marked out for subjection, others for rule.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>And there are many kinds both of rulers and subjects (and that 
<A NAME="199"></A>rule is the better which is exercised over better subjects- for example, 
<A NAME="200"></A>to rule over men is better than to rule over wild beasts; for the work 
<A NAME="201"></A>is better which is executed by better workmen, and where one man rules 
<A NAME="202"></A>and another is ruled, they may be said to have a work); for in all things 
<A NAME="203"></A>which form a composite whole and which are made up of parts, whether continuous 
<A NAME="204"></A>or discrete, a distinction between the ruling and the subject element comes 
<A NAME="205"></A>to fight. Such a duality exists in living creatures, but not in them only; 
<A NAME="206"></A>it originates in the constitution of the universe; even in things which 
<A NAME="207"></A>have no life there is a ruling principle, as in a musical mode. But we 
<A NAME="208"></A>are wandering from the subject. We will therefore restrict ourselves to 
<A NAME="209"></A>the living creature, which, in the first place, consists of soul and body: 
<A NAME="210"></A>and of these two, the one is by nature the ruler, and the other the subject. 
<A NAME="211"></A>But then we must look for the intentions of nature in things which retain 
<A NAME="212"></A>their nature, and not in things which are corrupted. And therefore we must 
<A NAME="213"></A>study the man who is in the most perfect state both of body and soul, for 
<A NAME="214"></A>in him we shall see the true relation of the two; although in bad or corrupted 
<A NAME="215"></A>natures the body will often appear to rule over the soul, because they 
<A NAME="216"></A>are in an evil and unnatural condition. At all events we may firstly observe 
<A NAME="217"></A>in living creatures both a despotical and a constitutional rule; for the 
<A NAME="218"></A>soul rules the body with a despotical rule, whereas the intellect rules 
<A NAME="219"></A>the appetites with a constitutional and royal rule. And it is clear that 
<A NAME="220"></A>the rule of the soul over the body, and of the mind and the rational element 
<A NAME="221"></A>over the passionate, is natural and expedient; whereas the equality of 
<A NAME="222"></A>the two or the rule of the inferior is always hurtful. The same holds good 
<A NAME="223"></A>of animals in relation to men; for tame animals have a better nature than 
<A NAME="224"></A>wild, and all tame animals are better off when they are ruled by man; for 
<A NAME="225"></A>then they are preserved. Again, the male is by nature superior, and the 
<A NAME="226"></A>female inferior; and the one rules, and the other is ruled; this principle, 
<A NAME="227"></A>of necessity, extends to all mankind.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>Where then there is such a difference as that between soul and 
<A NAME="229"></A>body, or between men and animals (as in the case of those whose business 
<A NAME="230"></A>is to use their body, and who can do nothing better), the lower sort are 
<A NAME="231"></A>by nature slaves, and it is better for them as for all inferiors that they 
<A NAME="232"></A>should be under the rule of a master. For he who can be, and therefore 
<A NAME="233"></A>is, another's and he who participates in rational principle enough to apprehend, 
<A NAME="234"></A>but not to have, such a principle, is a slave by nature. Whereas the lower 
<A NAME="235"></A>animals cannot even apprehend a principle; they obey their instincts. And 
<A NAME="236"></A>indeed the use made of slaves and of tame animals is not very different; 
<A NAME="237"></A>for both with their bodies minister to the needs of life. Nature would 
<A NAME="238"></A>like to distinguish between the bodies of freemen and slaves, making the 
<A NAME="239"></A>one strong for servile labor, the other upright, and although useless for 
<A NAME="240"></A>such services, useful for political life in the arts both of war and peace. 
<A NAME="241"></A>But the opposite often happens- that some have the souls and others have 
<A NAME="242"></A>the bodies of freemen. And doubtless if men differed from one another in 
<A NAME="243"></A>the mere forms of their bodies as much as the statues of the Gods do from 
<A NAME="244"></A>men, all would acknowledge that the inferior class should be slaves of 
<A NAME="245"></A>the superior. And if this is true of the body, how much more just that 
<A NAME="246"></A>a similar distinction should exist in the soul? but the beauty of the body 
<A NAME="247"></A>is seen, whereas the beauty of the soul is not seen. It is clear, then, 
<A NAME="248"></A>that some men are by nature free, and others slaves, and that for these 
<A NAME="249"></A>latter slavery is both expedient and right.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="250"></A><B>Part VI</B>

<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>But that those who take the opposite view have in a certain way 
<A NAME="252"></A>right on their side, may be easily seen. For the words slavery and slave 
<A NAME="253"></A>are used in two senses. There is a slave or slavery by law as well as by 
<A NAME="254"></A>nature. The law of which I speak is a sort of convention- the law by which 
<A NAME="255"></A>whatever is taken in war is supposed to belong to the victors. But this 
<A NAME="256"></A>right many jurists impeach, as they would an orator who brought forward 
<A NAME="257"></A>an unconstitutional measure: they detest the notion that, because one man 
<A NAME="258"></A>has the power of doing violence and is superior in brute strength, another 
<A NAME="259"></A>shall be his slave and subject. Even among philosophers there is a difference 
<A NAME="260"></A>of opinion. The origin of the dispute, and what makes the views invade 
<A NAME="261"></A>each other's territory, is as follows: in some sense virtue, when furnished 
<A NAME="262"></A>with means, has actually the greatest power of exercising force; and as 
<A NAME="263"></A>superior power is only found where there is superior excellence of some 
<A NAME="264"></A>kind, power seems to imply virtue, and the dispute to be simply one about 
<A NAME="265"></A>justice (for it is due to one party identifying justice with goodwill while 
<A NAME="266"></A>the other identifies it with the mere rule of the stronger). If these views 
<A NAME="267"></A>are thus set out separately, the other views have no force or plausibility 
<A NAME="268"></A>against the view that the superior in virtue ought to rule, or be master. 
<A NAME="269"></A>Others, clinging, as they think, simply to a principle of justice (for 
<A NAME="270"></A>law and custom are a sort of justice), assume that slavery in accordance 
<A NAME="271"></A>with the custom of war is justified by law, but at the same moment they 
<A NAME="272"></A>deny this. For what if the cause of the war be unjust? And again, no one 
<A NAME="273"></A>would ever say he is a slave who is unworthy to be a slave. Were this the 
<A NAME="274"></A>case, men of the highest rank would be slaves and the children of slaves 
<A NAME="275"></A>if they or their parents chance to have been taken captive and sold. Wherefore 
<A NAME="276"></A>Hellenes do not like to call Hellenes slaves, but confine the term to barbarians. 
<A NAME="277"></A>Yet, in using this language, they really mean the natural slave of whom 
<A NAME="278"></A>we spoke at first; for it must be admitted that some are slaves everywhere, 
<A NAME="279"></A>others nowhere. The same principle applies to nobility. Hellenes regard 
<A NAME="280"></A>themselves as noble everywhere, and not only in their own country, but 
<A NAME="281"></A>they deem the barbarians noble only when at home, thereby implying that 
<A NAME="282"></A>there are two sorts of nobility and freedom, the one absolute, the other 
<A NAME="283"></A>relative. The Helen of Theodectes says: <BR><BR>"Who would presume to call 
<A NAME="284"></A>me servant who am on both sides sprung from the stem of the Gods? 
<A NAME="285"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="286"></A>What does this mean but that they distinguish freedom and slavery, noble 
<A NAME="287"></A>and humble birth, by the two principles of good and evil? They think that 
<A NAME="288"></A>as men and animals beget men and animals, so from good men a good man springs. 
<A NAME="289"></A>But this is what nature, though she may intend it, cannot always 
<A NAME="290"></A>accomplish.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>We see then that there is some foundation for this difference of 
<A NAME="292"></A>opinion, and that all are not either slaves by nature or freemen by nature, 
<A NAME="293"></A>and also that there is in some cases a marked distinction between the two 
<A NAME="294"></A>classes, rendering it expedient and right for the one to be slaves and 
<A NAME="295"></A>the others to be masters: the one practicing obedience, the others exercising 
<A NAME="296"></A>the authority and lordship which nature intended them to have. The abuse 
<A NAME="297"></A>of this authority is injurious to both; for the interests of part and whole, 
<A NAME="298"></A>of body and soul, are the same, and the slave is a part of the master, 
<A NAME="299"></A>a living but separated part of his bodily frame. Hence, where the relation 
<A NAME="300"></A>of master and slave between them is natural they are friends and have a 
<A NAME="301"></A>common interest, but where it rests merely on law and force the reverse 
<A NAME="302"></A>is true.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="303"></A><B>Part VII</B>

<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>The previous remarks are quite enough to show that the rule of 
<A NAME="305"></A>a master is not a constitutional rule, and that all the different kinds 
<A NAME="306"></A>of rule are not, as some affirm, the same with each other. For there is 
<A NAME="307"></A>one rule exercised over subjects who are by nature free, another over subjects 
<A NAME="308"></A>who are by nature slaves. The rule of a household is a monarchy, for every 
<A NAME="309"></A>house is under one head: whereas constitutional rule is a government of 
<A NAME="310"></A>freemen and equals. The master is not called a master because he has science, 
<A NAME="311"></A>but because he is of a certain character, and the same remark applies to 
<A NAME="312"></A>the slave and the freeman. Still there may be a science for the master 
<A NAME="313"></A>and science for the slave. The science of the slave would be such as the 
<A NAME="314"></A>man of Syracuse taught, who made money by instructing slaves in their ordinary 
<A NAME="315"></A>duties. And such a knowledge may be carried further, so as to include cookery 
<A NAME="316"></A>and similar menial arts. For some duties are of the more necessary, others 
<A NAME="317"></A>of the more honorable sort; as the proverb says, 'slave before slave, master 
<A NAME="318"></A>before master.' But all such branches of knowledge are servile. There is 
<A NAME="319"></A>likewise a science of the master, which teaches the use of slaves; for 
<A NAME="320"></A>the master as such is concerned, not with the acquisition, but with the 
<A NAME="321"></A>use of them. Yet this so-called science is not anything great or wonderful; 
<A NAME="322"></A>for the master need only know how to order that which the slave must know 
<A NAME="323"></A>how to execute. Hence those who are in a position which places them above 
<A NAME="324"></A>toil have stewards who attend to their households while they occupy themselves 
<A NAME="325"></A>with philosophy or with politics. But the art of acquiring slaves, I mean 
<A NAME="326"></A>of justly acquiring them, differs both from the art of the master and the 
<A NAME="327"></A>art of the slave, being a species of hunting or war. Enough of the distinction 
<A NAME="328"></A>between master and slave.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="329"></A><B>Part VIII</B>

<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>Let us now inquire into property generally, and into the art of 
<A NAME="331"></A>getting wealth, in accordance with our usual method, for a slave has been 
<A NAME="332"></A>shown to be a part of property. The first question is whether the art of 
<A NAME="333"></A>getting wealth is the same with the art of managing a household or a part 
<A NAME="334"></A>of it, or instrumental to it; and if the last, whether in the way that 
<A NAME="335"></A>the art of making shuttles is instrumental to the art of weaving, or in 
<A NAME="336"></A>the way that the casting of bronze is instrumental to the art of the statuary, 
<A NAME="337"></A>for they are not instrumental in the same way, but the one provides tools 
<A NAME="338"></A>and the other material; and by material I mean the substratum out of which 
<A NAME="339"></A>any work is made; thus wool is the material of the weaver, bronze of the 
<A NAME="340"></A>statuary. Now it is easy to see that the art of household management is 
<A NAME="341"></A>not identical with the art of getting wealth, for the one uses the material 
<A NAME="342"></A>which the other provides. For the art which uses household stores can be 
<A NAME="343"></A>no other than the art of household management. There is, however, a doubt 
<A NAME="344"></A>whether the art of getting wealth is a part of household management or 
<A NAME="345"></A>a distinct art. If the getter of wealth has to consider whence wealth and 
<A NAME="346"></A>property can be procured, but there are many sorts of property and riches, 
<A NAME="347"></A>then are husbandry, and the care and provision of food in general, parts 
<A NAME="348"></A>of the wealth-getting art or distinct arts? Again, there are many sorts 
<A NAME="349"></A>of food, and therefore there are many kinds of lives both of animals and 
<A NAME="350"></A>men; they must all have food, and the differences in their food have made 
<A NAME="351"></A>differences in their ways of life. For of beasts, some are gregarious, 
<A NAME="352"></A>others are solitary; they live in the way which is best adapted to sustain 
<A NAME="353"></A>them, accordingly as they are carnivorous or herbivorous or omnivorous: 
<A NAME="354"></A>and their habits are determined for them by nature in such a manner that 
<A NAME="355"></A>they may obtain with greater facility the food of their choice. But, as 
<A NAME="356"></A>different species have different tastes, the same things are not naturally 
<A NAME="357"></A>pleasant to all of them; and therefore the lives of carnivorous or herbivorous 
<A NAME="358"></A>animals further differ among themselves. In the lives of men too there 
<A NAME="359"></A>is a great difference. The laziest are shepherds, who lead an idle life, 
<A NAME="360"></A>and get their subsistence without trouble from tame animals; their flocks 
<A NAME="361"></A>having to wander from place to place in search of pasture, they are compelled 
<A NAME="362"></A>to follow them, cultivating a sort of living farm. Others support themselves 
<A NAME="363"></A>by hunting, which is of different kinds. Some, for example, are brigands, 
<A NAME="364"></A>others, who dwell near lakes or marshes or rivers or a sea in which there 
<A NAME="365"></A>are fish, are fishermen, and others live by the pursuit of birds or wild 
<A NAME="366"></A>beasts. The greater number obtain a living from the cultivated fruits of 
<A NAME="367"></A>the soil. Such are the modes of subsistence which prevail among those whose 
<A NAME="368"></A>industry springs up of itself, and whose food is not acquired by exchange 
<A NAME="369"></A>and retail trade- there is the shepherd, the husbandman, the brigand, the 
<A NAME="370"></A>fisherman, the hunter. Some gain a comfortable maintenance out of two employments, 
<A NAME="371"></A>eking out the deficiencies of one of them by another: thus the life of 
<A NAME="372"></A>a shepherd may be combined with that of a brigand, the life of a farmer 
<A NAME="373"></A>with that of a hunter. Other modes of life are similarly combined in any 
<A NAME="374"></A>way which the needs of men may require. Property, in the sense of a bare 
<A NAME="375"></A>livelihood, seems to be given by nature herself to all, both when they 
<A NAME="376"></A>are first born, and when they are grown up. For some animals bring forth, 
<A NAME="377"></A>together with their offspring, so much food as will last until they are 
<A NAME="378"></A>able to supply themselves; of this the vermiparous or oviparous animals 
<A NAME="379"></A>are an instance; and the viviparous animals have up to a certain time a 
<A NAME="380"></A>supply of food for their young in themselves, which is called milk. In 
<A NAME="381"></A>like manner we may infer that, after the birth of animals, plants exist 
<A NAME="382"></A>for their sake, and that the other animals exist for the sake of man, the 
<A NAME="383"></A>tame for use and food, the wild, if not all at least the greater part of 
<A NAME="384"></A>them, for food, and for the provision of clothing and various instruments. 
<A NAME="385"></A>Now if nature makes nothing incomplete, and nothing in vain, the inference 
<A NAME="386"></A>must be that she has made all animals for the sake of man. And so, in one 
<A NAME="387"></A>point of view, the art of war is a natural art of acquisition, for the 
<A NAME="388"></A>art of acquisition includes hunting, an art which we ought to practice 
<A NAME="389"></A>against wild beasts, and against men who, though intended by nature to 
<A NAME="390"></A>be governed, will not submit; for war of such a kind is naturally 
<A NAME="391"></A>just.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>Of the art of acquisition then there is one kind which by nature 
<A NAME="393"></A>is a part of the management of a household, in so far as the art of household 
<A NAME="394"></A>management must either find ready to hand, or itself provide, such things 
<A NAME="395"></A>necessary to life, and useful for the community of the family or state, 
<A NAME="396"></A>as can be stored. They are the elements of true riches; for the amount 
<A NAME="397"></A>of property which is needed for a good life is not unlimited, although 
<A NAME="398"></A>Solon in one of his poems says that <BR><BR>"No bound to riches has been 
<A NAME="399"></A>fixed for man. "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="400"></A>But there is a boundary fixed, just as there is in the other arts; for 
<A NAME="401"></A>the instruments of any art are never unlimited, either in number or size, 
<A NAME="402"></A>and riches may be defined as a number of instruments to be used in a household 
<A NAME="403"></A>or in a state. And so we see that there is a natural art of acquisition 
<A NAME="404"></A>which is practiced by managers of households and by statesmen, and what 
<A NAME="405"></A>is the reason of this.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="406"></A><B>Part IX</B>

<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>There is another variety of the art of acquisition which is commonly 
<A NAME="408"></A>and rightly called an art of wealth-getting, and has in fact suggested 
<A NAME="409"></A>the notion that riches and property have no limit. Being nearly connected 
<A NAME="410"></A>with the preceding, it is often identified with it. But though they are 
<A NAME="411"></A>not very different, neither are they the same. The kind already described 
<A NAME="412"></A>is given by nature, the other is gained by experience and 
<A NAME="413"></A>art.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>Let us begin our discussion of the question with the following 
<A NAME="415"></A>considerations:
<A NAME="416"></A><BR><BR>Of everything which we possess there are two uses: both belong 
<A NAME="417"></A>to the thing as such, but not in the same manner, for one is the proper, 
<A NAME="418"></A>and the other the improper or secondary use of it. For example, a shoe 
<A NAME="419"></A>is used for wear, and is used for exchange; both are uses of the shoe. 
<A NAME="420"></A>He who gives a shoe in exchange for money or food to him who wants one, 
<A NAME="421"></A>does indeed use the shoe as a shoe, but this is not its proper or primary 
<A NAME="422"></A>purpose, for a shoe is not made to be an object of barter. The same may 
<A NAME="423"></A>be said of all possessions, for the art of exchange extends to all of them, 
<A NAME="424"></A>and it arises at first from what is natural, from the circumstance that 
<A NAME="425"></A>some have too little, others too much. Hence we may infer that retail trade 
<A NAME="426"></A>is not a natural part of the art of getting wealth; had it been so, men 
<A NAME="427"></A>would have ceased to exchange when they had enough. In the first community, 
<A NAME="428"></A>indeed, which is the family, this art is obviously of no use, but it begins 
<A NAME="429"></A>to be useful when the society increases. For the members of the family 
<A NAME="430"></A>originally had all things in common; later, when the family divided into 
<A NAME="431"></A>parts, the parts shared in many things, and different parts in different 
<A NAME="432"></A>things, which they had to give in exchange for what they wanted, a kind 
<A NAME="433"></A>of barter which is still practiced among barbarous nations who exchange 
<A NAME="434"></A>with one another the necessaries of life and nothing more; giving and receiving 
<A NAME="435"></A>wine, for example, in exchange for coin, and the like. This sort of barter 
<A NAME="436"></A>is not part of the wealth-getting art and is not contrary to nature, but 
<A NAME="437"></A>is needed for the satisfaction of men's natural wants. The other or more 
<A NAME="438"></A>complex form of exchange grew, as might have been inferred, out of the 
<A NAME="439"></A>simpler. When the inhabitants of one country became more dependent on those 
<A NAME="440"></A>of another, and they imported what they needed, and exported what they 
<A NAME="441"></A>had too much of, money necessarily came into use. For the various necessaries 
<A NAME="442"></A>of life are not easily carried about, and hence men agreed to employ in 
<A NAME="443"></A>their dealings with each other something which was intrinsically useful 
<A NAME="444"></A>and easily applicable to the purposes of life, for example, iron, silver, 
<A NAME="445"></A>and the like. Of this the value was at first measured simply by size and 
<A NAME="446"></A>weight, but in process of time they put a stamp upon it, to save the trouble 
<A NAME="447"></A>of weighing and to mark the value.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>When the use of coin had once been discovered, out of the barter 
<A NAME="449"></A>of necessary articles arose the other art of wealth getting, namely, retail 
<A NAME="450"></A>trade; which was at first probably a simple matter, but became more complicated 
<A NAME="451"></A>as soon as men learned by experience whence and by what exchanges the greatest 
<A NAME="452"></A>profit might be made. Originating in the use of coin, the art of getting 
<A NAME="453"></A>wealth is generally thought to be chiefly concerned with it, and to be 
<A NAME="454"></A>the art which produces riches and wealth; having to consider how they may 
<A NAME="455"></A>be accumulated. Indeed, riches is assumed by many to be only a quantity 
<A NAME="456"></A>of coin, because the arts of getting wealth and retail trade are concerned 
<A NAME="457"></A>with coin. Others maintain that coined money is a mere sham, a thing not 
<A NAME="458"></A>natural, but conventional only, because, if the users substitute another 
<A NAME="459"></A>commodity for it, it is worthless, and because it is not useful as a means 
<A NAME="460"></A>to any of the necessities of life, and, indeed, he who is rich in coin 
<A NAME="461"></A>may often be in want of necessary food. But how can that be wealth of which 
<A NAME="462"></A>a man may have a great abundance and yet perish with hunger, like Midas 
<A NAME="463"></A>in the fable, whose insatiable prayer turned everything that was set before 
<A NAME="464"></A>him into gold?
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>Hence men seek after a better notion of riches and of the art of 
<A NAME="466"></A>getting wealth than the mere acquisition of coin, and they are right. For 
<A NAME="467"></A>natural riches and the natural art of wealth-getting are a different thing; 
<A NAME="468"></A>in their true form they are part of the management of a household; whereas 
<A NAME="469"></A>retail trade is the art of producing wealth, not in every way, but by exchange. 
<A NAME="470"></A>And it is thought to be concerned with coin; for coin is the unit of exchange 
<A NAME="471"></A>and the measure or limit of it. And there is no bound to the riches which 
<A NAME="472"></A>spring from this art of wealth getting. As in the art of medicine there 
<A NAME="473"></A>is no limit to the pursuit of health, and as in the other arts there is 
<A NAME="474"></A>no limit to the pursuit of their several ends, for they aim at accomplishing 
<A NAME="475"></A>their ends to the uttermost (but of the means there is a limit, for the 
<A NAME="476"></A>end is always the limit), so, too, in this art of wealth-getting there 
<A NAME="477"></A>is no limit of the end, which is riches of the spurious kind, and the acquisition 
<A NAME="478"></A>of wealth. But the art of wealth-getting which consists in household management, 
<A NAME="479"></A>on the other hand, has a limit; the unlimited acquisition of wealth is 
<A NAME="480"></A>not its business. And, therefore, in one point of view, all riches must 
<A NAME="481"></A>have a limit; nevertheless, as a matter of fact, we find the opposite to 
<A NAME="482"></A>be the case; for all getters of wealth increase their hoard of coin without 
<A NAME="483"></A>limit. The source of the confusion is the near connection between the two 
<A NAME="484"></A>kinds of wealth-getting; in either, the instrument is the same, although 
<A NAME="485"></A>the use is different, and so they pass into one another; for each is a 
<A NAME="486"></A>use of the same property, but with a difference: accumulation is the end 
<A NAME="487"></A>in the one case, but there is a further end in the other. Hence some persons 
<A NAME="488"></A>are led to believe that getting wealth is the object of household management, 
<A NAME="489"></A>and the whole idea of their lives is that they ought either to increase 
<A NAME="490"></A>their money without limit, or at any rate not to lose it. The origin of 
<A NAME="491"></A>this disposition in men is that they are intent upon living only, and not 
<A NAME="492"></A>upon living well; and, as their desires are unlimited they also desire 
<A NAME="493"></A>that the means of gratifying them should be without limit. Those who do 
<A NAME="494"></A>aim at a good life seek the means of obtaining bodily pleasures; and, since 
<A NAME="495"></A>the enjoyment of these appears to depend on property, they are absorbed 
<A NAME="496"></A>in getting wealth: and so there arises the second species of wealth-getting. 
<A NAME="497"></A>For, as their enjoyment is in excess, they seek an art which produces the 
<A NAME="498"></A>excess of enjoyment; and, if they are not able to supply their pleasures 
<A NAME="499"></A>by the art of getting wealth, they try other arts, using in turn every 
<A NAME="500"></A>faculty in a manner contrary to nature. The quality of courage, for example, 
<A NAME="501"></A>is not intended to make wealth, but to inspire confidence; neither is this 
<A NAME="502"></A>the aim of the general's or of the physician's art; but the one aims at 
<A NAME="503"></A>victory and the other at health. Nevertheless, some men turn every quality 
<A NAME="504"></A>or art into a means of getting wealth; this they conceive to be the end, 
<A NAME="505"></A>and to the promotion of the end they think all things must 
<A NAME="506"></A>contribute.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>Thus, then, we have considered the art of wealth-getting which 
<A NAME="508"></A>is unnecessary, and why men want it; and also the necessary art of wealth-getting, 
<A NAME="509"></A>which we have seen to be different from the other, and to be a natural 
<A NAME="510"></A>part of the art of managing a household, concerned with the provision of 
<A NAME="511"></A>food, not, however, like the former kind, unlimited, but having a 
<A NAME="512"></A>limit.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="513"></A><B>Part X</B>

<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR>And we have found the answer to our original question, Whether 
<A NAME="515"></A>the art of getting wealth is the business of the manager of a household 
<A NAME="516"></A>and of the statesman or not their business? viz., that wealth is presupposed 
<A NAME="517"></A>by them. For as political science does not make men, but takes them from 
<A NAME="518"></A>nature and uses them, so too nature provides them with earth or sea or 
<A NAME="519"></A>the like as a source of food. At this stage begins the duty of the manager 
<A NAME="520"></A>of a household, who has to order the things which nature supplies; he may 
<A NAME="521"></A>be compared to the weaver who has not to make but to use wool, and to know, 
<A NAME="522"></A>too, what sort of wool is good and serviceable or bad and unserviceable. 
<A NAME="523"></A>Were this otherwise, it would be difficult to see why the art of getting 
<A NAME="524"></A>wealth is a part of the management of a household and the art of medicine 
<A NAME="525"></A>not; for surely the members of a household must have health just as they 
<A NAME="526"></A>must have life or any other necessary. The answer is that as from one point 
<A NAME="527"></A>of view the master of the house and the ruler of the state have to consider 
<A NAME="528"></A>about health, from another point of view not they but the physician; so 
<A NAME="529"></A>in one way the art of household management, in another way the subordinate 
<A NAME="530"></A>art, has to consider about wealth. But, strictly speaking, as I have already 
<A NAME="531"></A>said, the means of life must be provided beforehand by nature; for the 
<A NAME="532"></A>business of nature is to furnish food to that which is born, and the food 
<A NAME="533"></A>of the offspring is always what remains over of that from which it is produced. 
<A NAME="534"></A>Wherefore the art of getting wealth out of fruits and animals is always 
<A NAME="535"></A>natural.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>There are two sorts of wealth-getting, as I have said; one is a 
<A NAME="537"></A>part of household management, the other is retail trade: the former necessary 
<A NAME="538"></A>and honorable, while that which consists in exchange is justly censured; 
<A NAME="539"></A>for it is unnatural, and a mode by which men gain from one another. The 
<A NAME="540"></A>most hated sort, and with the greatest reason, is usury, which makes a 
<A NAME="541"></A>gain out of money itself, and not from the natural object of it. For money 
<A NAME="542"></A>was intended to be used in exchange, but not to increase at interest. And 
<A NAME="543"></A>this term interest, which means the birth of money from money, is applied 
<A NAME="544"></A>to the breeding of money because the offspring resembles the parent. Wherefore 
<A NAME="545"></A>of an modes of getting wealth this is the most unnatural.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="546"></A><B>Part XI</B>

<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>Enough has been said about the theory of wealth-getting; we will 
<A NAME="548"></A>now proceed to the practical part. The discussion of such matters is not 
<A NAME="549"></A>unworthy of philosophy, but to be engaged in them practically is illiberal 
<A NAME="550"></A>and irksome. The useful parts of wealth-getting are, first, the knowledge 
<A NAME="551"></A>of livestock- which are most profitable, and where, and how- as, for example, 
<A NAME="552"></A>what sort of horses or sheep or oxen or any other animals are most likely 
<A NAME="553"></A>to give a return. A man ought to know which of these pay better than others, 
<A NAME="554"></A>and which pay best in particular places, for some do better in one place 
<A NAME="555"></A>and some in another. Secondly, husbandry, which may be either tillage or 
<A NAME="556"></A>planting, and the keeping of bees and of fish, or fowl, or of any animals 
<A NAME="557"></A>which may be useful to man. These are the divisions of the true or proper 
<A NAME="558"></A>art of wealth-getting and come first. Of the other, which consists in exchange, 
<A NAME="559"></A>the first and most important division is commerce (of which there are three 
<A NAME="560"></A>kinds- the provision of a ship, the conveyance of goods, exposure for sale- 
<A NAME="561"></A>these again differing as they are safer or more profitable), the second 
<A NAME="562"></A>is usury, the third, service for hire- of this, one kind is employed in 
<A NAME="563"></A>the mechanical arts, the other in unskilled and bodily labor. There is 
<A NAME="564"></A>still a third sort of wealth getting intermediate between this and the 
<A NAME="565"></A>first or natural mode which is partly natural, but is also concerned with 
<A NAME="566"></A>exchange, viz., the industries that make their profit from the earth, and 
<A NAME="567"></A>from things growing from the earth which, although they bear no fruit, 
<A NAME="568"></A>are nevertheless profitable; for example, the cutting of timber and all 
<A NAME="569"></A>mining. The art of mining, by which minerals are obtained, itself has many 
<A NAME="570"></A>branches, for there are various kinds of things dug out of the earth. Of 
<A NAME="571"></A>the several divisions of wealth-getting I now speak generally; a minute 
<A NAME="572"></A>consideration of them might be useful in practice, but it would be tiresome 
<A NAME="573"></A>to dwell upon them at greater length now.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>Those occupations are most truly arts in which there is the least 
<A NAME="575"></A>element of chance; they are the meanest in which the body is most deteriorated, 
<A NAME="576"></A>the most servile in which there is the greatest use of the body, and the 
<A NAME="577"></A>most illiberal in which there is the least need of excellence.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>Works have been written upon these subjects by various persons; 
<A NAME="579"></A>for example, by Chares the Parian, and Apollodorus the Lemnian, who have 
<A NAME="580"></A>treated of Tillage and Planting, while others have treated of other branches; 
<A NAME="581"></A>any one who cares for such matters may refer to their writings. It would 
<A NAME="582"></A>be well also to collect the scattered stories of the ways in which individuals 
<A NAME="583"></A>have succeeded in amassing a fortune; for all this is useful to persons 
<A NAME="584"></A>who value the art of getting wealth. There is the anecdote of Thales the 
<A NAME="585"></A>Milesian and his financial device, which involves a principle of universal 
<A NAME="586"></A>application, but is attributed to him on account of his reputation for 
<A NAME="587"></A>wisdom. He was reproached for his poverty, which was supposed to show that 
<A NAME="588"></A>philosophy was of no use. According to the story, he knew by his skill 
<A NAME="589"></A>in the stars while it was yet winter that there would be a great harvest 
<A NAME="590"></A>of olives in the coming year; so, having a little money, he gave deposits 
<A NAME="591"></A>for the use of all the olive-presses in Chios and Miletus, which he hired 
<A NAME="592"></A>at a low price because no one bid against him. When the harvest-time came, 
<A NAME="593"></A>and many were wanted all at once and of a sudden, he let them out at any 
<A NAME="594"></A>rate which he pleased, and made a quantity of money. Thus he showed the 
<A NAME="595"></A>world that philosophers can easily be rich if they like, but that their 
<A NAME="596"></A>ambition is of another sort. He is supposed to have given a striking proof 
<A NAME="597"></A>of his wisdom, but, as I was saying, his device for getting wealth is of 
<A NAME="598"></A>universal application, and is nothing but the creation of a monopoly. It 
<A NAME="599"></A>is an art often practiced by cities when they are want of money; they make 
<A NAME="600"></A>a monopoly of provisions.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>There was a man of Sicily, who, having money deposited with him, 
<A NAME="602"></A>bought up an the iron from the iron mines; afterwards, when the merchants 
<A NAME="603"></A>from their various markets came to buy, he was the only seller, and without 
<A NAME="604"></A>much increasing the price he gained 200 per cent. Which when Dionysius 
<A NAME="605"></A>heard, he told him that he might take away his money, but that he must 
<A NAME="606"></A>not remain at Syracuse, for he thought that the man had discovered a way 
<A NAME="607"></A>of making money which was injurious to his own interests. He made the same 
<A NAME="608"></A>discovery as Thales; they both contrived to create a monopoly for themselves. 
<A NAME="609"></A>And statesmen as well ought to know these things; for a state is often 
<A NAME="610"></A>as much in want of money and of such devices for obtaining it as a household, 
<A NAME="611"></A>or even more so; hence some public men devote themselves entirely to 
<A NAME="612"></A>finance.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="613"></A><B>Part XII</B>

<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>Of household management we have seen that there are three parts- 
<A NAME="615"></A>one is the rule of a master over slaves, which has been discussed already, 
<A NAME="616"></A>another of a father, and the third of a husband. A husband and father, 
<A NAME="617"></A>we saw, rules over wife and children, both free, but the rule differs, 
<A NAME="618"></A>the rule over his children being a royal, over his wife a constitutional 
<A NAME="619"></A>rule. For although there may be exceptions to the order of nature, the 
<A NAME="620"></A>male is by nature fitter for command than the female, just as the elder 
<A NAME="621"></A>and full-grown is superior to the younger and more immature. But in most 
<A NAME="622"></A>constitutional states the citizens rule and are ruled by turns, for the 
<A NAME="623"></A>idea of a constitutional state implies that the natures of the citizens 
<A NAME="624"></A>are equal, and do not differ at all. Nevertheless, when one rules and the 
<A NAME="625"></A>other is ruled we endeavor to create a difference of outward forms and 
<A NAME="626"></A>names and titles of respect, which may be illustrated by the saying of 
<A NAME="627"></A>Amasis about his foot-pan. The relation of the male to the female is of 
<A NAME="628"></A>this kind, but there the inequality is permanent. The rule of a father 
<A NAME="629"></A>over his children is royal, for he rules by virtue both of love and of 
<A NAME="630"></A>the respect due to age, exercising a kind of royal power. And therefore 
<A NAME="631"></A>Homer has appropriately called Zeus 'father of Gods and men,' because he 
<A NAME="632"></A>is the king of them all. For a king is the natural superior of his subjects, 
<A NAME="633"></A>but he should be of the same kin or kind with them, and such is the relation 
<A NAME="634"></A>of elder and younger, of father and son.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="635"></A><B>Part XIII</B>

<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>Thus it is clear that household management attends more to men 
<A NAME="637"></A>than to the acquisition of inanimate things, and to human excellence more 
<A NAME="638"></A>than to the excellence of property which we call wealth, and to the virtue 
<A NAME="639"></A>of freemen more than to the virtue of slaves. A question may indeed be 
<A NAME="640"></A>raised, whether there is any excellence at all in a slave beyond and higher 
<A NAME="641"></A>than merely instrumental and ministerial qualities- whether he can have 
<A NAME="642"></A>the virtues of temperance, courage, justice, and the like; or whether slaves 
<A NAME="643"></A>possess only bodily and ministerial qualities. And, whichever way we answer 
<A NAME="644"></A>the question, a difficulty arises; for, if they have virtue, in what will 
<A NAME="645"></A>they differ from freemen? On the other hand, since they are men and share 
<A NAME="646"></A>in rational principle, it seems absurd to say that they have no virtue. 
<A NAME="647"></A>A similar question may be raised about women and children, whether they 
<A NAME="648"></A>too have virtues: ought a woman to be temperate and brave and just, and 
<A NAME="649"></A>is a child to be called temperate, and intemperate, or note So in general 
<A NAME="650"></A>we may ask about the natural ruler, and the natural subject, whether they 
<A NAME="651"></A>have the same or different virtues. For if a noble nature is equally required 
<A NAME="652"></A>in both, why should one of them always rule, and the other always be ruled? 
<A NAME="653"></A>Nor can we say that this is a question of degree, for the difference between 
<A NAME="654"></A>ruler and subject is a difference of kind, which the difference of more 
<A NAME="655"></A>and less never is. Yet how strange is the supposition that the one ought, 
<A NAME="656"></A>and that the other ought not, to have virtue! For if the ruler is intemperate 
<A NAME="657"></A>and unjust, how can he rule well? If the subject, how can he obey well? 
<A NAME="658"></A>If he be licentious and cowardly, he will certainly not do his duty. It 
<A NAME="659"></A>is evident, therefore, that both of them must have a share of virtue, but 
<A NAME="660"></A>varying as natural subjects also vary among themselves. Here the very constitution 
<A NAME="661"></A>of the soul has shown us the way; in it one part naturally rules, and the 
<A NAME="662"></A>other is subject, and the virtue of the ruler we in maintain to be different 
<A NAME="663"></A>from that of the subject; the one being the virtue of the rational, and 
<A NAME="664"></A>the other of the irrational part. Now, it is obvious that the same principle 
<A NAME="665"></A>applies generally, and therefore almost all things rule and are ruled according 
<A NAME="666"></A>to nature. But the kind of rule differs; the freeman rules over the slave 
<A NAME="667"></A>after another manner from that in which the male rules over the female, 
<A NAME="668"></A>or the man over the child; although the parts of the soul are present in 
<A NAME="669"></A>an of them, they are present in different degrees. For the slave has no 
<A NAME="670"></A>deliberative faculty at all; the woman has, but it is without authority, 
<A NAME="671"></A>and the child has, but it is immature. So it must necessarily be supposed 
<A NAME="672"></A>to be with the moral virtues also; all should partake of them, but only 
<A NAME="673"></A>in such manner and degree as is required by each for the fulfillment of 
<A NAME="674"></A>his duty. Hence the ruler ought to have moral virtue in perfection, for 
<A NAME="675"></A>his function, taken absolutely, demands a master artificer, and rational 
<A NAME="676"></A>principle is such an artificer; the subjects, oil the other hand, require 
<A NAME="677"></A>only that measure of virtue which is proper to each of them. Clearly, then, 
<A NAME="678"></A>moral virtue belongs to all of them; but the temperance of a man and of 
<A NAME="679"></A>a woman, or the courage and justice of a man and of a woman, are not, as 
<A NAME="680"></A>Socrates maintained, the same; the courage of a man is shown in commanding, 
<A NAME="681"></A>of a woman in obeying. And this holds of all other virtues, as will be 
<A NAME="682"></A>more clearly seen if we look at them in detail, for those who say generally 
<A NAME="683"></A>that virtue consists in a good disposition of the soul, or in doing rightly, 
<A NAME="684"></A>or the like, only deceive themselves. Far better than such definitions 
<A NAME="685"></A>is their mode of speaking, who, like Gorgias, enumerate the virtues. All 
<A NAME="686"></A>classes must be deemed to have their special attributes; as the poet says 
<A NAME="687"></A>of women, <BR><BR>"Silence is a woman's glory, "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="688"></A>but this is not equally the glory of man. The child is imperfect, and therefore 
<A NAME="689"></A>obviously his virtue is not relative to himself alone, but to the perfect 
<A NAME="690"></A>man and to his teacher, and in like manner the virtue of the slave is relative 
<A NAME="691"></A>to a master. Now we determined that a slave is useful for the wants of 
<A NAME="692"></A>life, and therefore he will obviously require only so much virtue as will 
<A NAME="693"></A>prevent him from failing in his duty through cowardice or lack of self-control. 
<A NAME="694"></A>Some one will ask whether, if what we are saying is true, virtue will not 
<A NAME="695"></A>be required also in the artisans, for they often fail in their work through 
<A NAME="696"></A>the lack of self control? But is there not a great difference in the two 
<A NAME="697"></A>cases? For the slave shares in his master's life; the artisan is less closely 
<A NAME="698"></A>connected with him, and only attains excellence in proportion as he becomes 
<A NAME="699"></A>a slave. The meaner sort of mechanic has a special and separate slavery; 
<A NAME="700"></A>and whereas the slave exists by nature, not so the shoemaker or other artisan. 
<A NAME="701"></A>It is manifest, then, that the master ought to be the source of such excellence 
<A NAME="702"></A>in the slave, and not a mere possessor of the art of mastership which trains 
<A NAME="703"></A>the slave in his duties. Wherefore they are mistaken who forbid us to converse 
<A NAME="704"></A>with slaves and say that we should employ command only, for slaves stand 
<A NAME="705"></A>even more in need of admonition than children.
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR>So much for this subject; the relations of husband and wife, parent 
<A NAME="707"></A>and child, their several virtues, what in their intercourse with one another 
<A NAME="708"></A>is good, and what is evil, and how we may pursue the good and good and 
<A NAME="709"></A>escape the evil, will have to be discussed when we speak of the different 
<A NAME="710"></A>forms of government. For, inasmuch as every family is a part of a state, 
<A NAME="711"></A>and these relationships are the parts of a family, and the virtue of the 
<A NAME="712"></A>part must have regard to the virtue of the whole, women and children must 
<A NAME="713"></A>be trained by education with an eye to the constitution, if the virtues 
<A NAME="714"></A>of either of them are supposed to make any difference in the virtues of 
<A NAME="715"></A>the state. And they must make a difference: for the children grow up to 
<A NAME="716"></A>be citizens, and half the free persons in a state are 
<A NAME="717"></A>women.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR><BR>Of these matters, enough has been said; of what remains, let us 
<A NAME="719"></A>speak at another time. Regarding, then, our present inquiry as complete, 
<A NAME="720"></A>we will make a new beginning. And, first, let us examine the various theories 
<A NAME="721"></A>of a perfect state.
