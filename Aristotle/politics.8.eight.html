<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part I</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>No ne will doubt that the legislator should direct his attention above 
<A NAME="12"></A>all to the education of youth; for the neglect of education does harm to 
<A NAME="13"></A>the constitution The citizen should be molded to suit the form of government 
<A NAME="14"></A>under which he lives. For each government has a peculiar character which 
<A NAME="15"></A>originally formed and which continues to preserve it. The character of 
<A NAME="16"></A>democracy creates democracy, and the character of oligarchy creates oligarchy; 
<A NAME="17"></A>and always the better the character, the better the 
<A NAME="18"></A>government.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>Again, for the exercise of any faculty or art a previous training 
<A NAME="20"></A>and habituation are required; clearly therefore for the practice of virtue. 
<A NAME="21"></A>And since the whole city has one end, it is manifest that education should 
<A NAME="22"></A>be one and the same for all, and that it should be public, and not private- 
<A NAME="23"></A>not as at present, when every one looks after his own children separately, 
<A NAME="24"></A>and gives them separate instruction of the sort which he thinks best; the 
<A NAME="25"></A>training in things which are of common interest should be the same for 
<A NAME="26"></A>all. Neither must we suppose that any one of the citizens belongs to himself, 
<A NAME="27"></A>for they all belong to the state, and are each of them a part of the state, 
<A NAME="28"></A>and the care of each part is inseparable from the care of the whole. In 
<A NAME="29"></A>this particular as in some others the Lacedaemonians are to be praised, 
<A NAME="30"></A>for they take the greatest pains about their children, and make education 
<A NAME="31"></A>the business of the state.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="32"></A><B>Part II</B>

<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>That education should be regulated by law and should be an affair 
<A NAME="34"></A>of state is not to be denied, but what should be the character of this 
<A NAME="35"></A>public education, and how young persons should be educated, are questions 
<A NAME="36"></A>which remain to be considered. As things are, there is disagreement about 
<A NAME="37"></A>the subjects. For mankind are by no means agreed about the things to be 
<A NAME="38"></A>taught, whether we look to virtue or the best life. Neither is it clear 
<A NAME="39"></A>whether education is more concerned with intellectual or with moral virtue. 
<A NAME="40"></A>The existing practice is perplexing; no one knows on what principle we 
<A NAME="41"></A>should proceed- should the useful in life, or should virtue, or should 
<A NAME="42"></A>the higher knowledge, be the aim of our training; all three opinions have 
<A NAME="43"></A>been entertained. Again, about the means there is no agreement; for different 
<A NAME="44"></A>persons, starting with different ideas about the nature of virtue, naturally 
<A NAME="45"></A>disagree about the practice of it. There can be no doubt that children 
<A NAME="46"></A>should be taught those useful things which are really necessary, but not 
<A NAME="47"></A>all useful things; for occupations are divided into liberal and illiberal; 
<A NAME="48"></A>and to young children should be imparted only such kinds of knowledge as 
<A NAME="49"></A>will be useful to them without vulgarizing them. And any occupation, art, 
<A NAME="50"></A>or science, which makes the body or soul or mind of the freeman less fit 
<A NAME="51"></A>for the practice or exercise of virtue, is vulgar; wherefore we call those 
<A NAME="52"></A>arts vulgar which tend to deform the body, and likewise all paid employments, 
<A NAME="53"></A>for they absorb and degrade the mind. There are also some liberal arts 
<A NAME="54"></A>quite proper for a freeman to acquire, but only in a certain degree, and 
<A NAME="55"></A>if he attend to them too closely, in order to attain perfection in them, 
<A NAME="56"></A>the same evil effects will follow. The object also which a man sets before 
<A NAME="57"></A>him makes a great difference; if he does or learns anything for his own 
<A NAME="58"></A>sake or for the sake of his friends, or with a view to excellence the action 
<A NAME="59"></A>will not appear illiberal; but if done for the sake of others, the very 
<A NAME="60"></A>same action will be thought menial and servile. The received subjects of 
<A NAME="61"></A>instruction, as I have already remarked, are partly of a liberal and party 
<A NAME="62"></A>of an illiberal character.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="63"></A><B>Part III</B>

<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>The customary branches of education are in number four; they are- 
<A NAME="65"></A>(1) reading and writing, (2) gymnastic exercises, (3) music, to which is 
<A NAME="66"></A>sometimes added (4) drawing. Of these, reading and writing and drawing 
<A NAME="67"></A>are regarded as useful for the purposes of life in a variety of ways, and 
<A NAME="68"></A>gymnastic exercises are thought to infuse courage. concerning music a doubt 
<A NAME="69"></A>may be raised- in our own day most men cultivate it for the sake of pleasure, 
<A NAME="70"></A>but originally it was included in education, because nature herself, as 
<A NAME="71"></A>has been often said, requires that we should be able, not only to work 
<A NAME="72"></A>well, but to use leisure well; for, as I must repeat once again, the first 
<A NAME="73"></A>principle of all action is leisure. Both are required, but leisure is better 
<A NAME="74"></A>than occupation and is its end; and therefore the question must be asked, 
<A NAME="75"></A>what ought we to do when at leisure? Clearly we ought not to be amusing 
<A NAME="76"></A>ourselves, for then amusement would be the end of life. But if this is 
<A NAME="77"></A>inconceivable, and amusement is needed more amid serious occupations than 
<A NAME="78"></A>at other times (for he who is hard at work has need of relaxation, and 
<A NAME="79"></A>amusement gives relaxation, whereas occupation is always accompanied with 
<A NAME="80"></A>exertion and effort), we should introduce amusements only at suitable times, 
<A NAME="81"></A>and they should be our medicines, for the emotion which they create in 
<A NAME="82"></A>the soul is a relaxation, and from the pleasure we obtain rest. But leisure 
<A NAME="83"></A>of itself gives pleasure and happiness and enjoyment of life, which are 
<A NAME="84"></A>experienced, not by the busy man, but by those who have leisure. For he 
<A NAME="85"></A>who is occupied has in view some end which he has not attained; but happiness 
<A NAME="86"></A>is an end, since all men deem it to be accompanied with pleasure and not 
<A NAME="87"></A>with pain. This pleasure, however, is regarded differently by different 
<A NAME="88"></A>persons, and varies according to the habit of individuals; the pleasure 
<A NAME="89"></A>of the best man is the best, and springs from the noblest sources. It is 
<A NAME="90"></A>clear then that there are branches of learning and education which we must 
<A NAME="91"></A>study merely with a view to leisure spent in intellectual activity, and 
<A NAME="92"></A>these are to be valued for their own sake; whereas those kinds of knowledge 
<A NAME="93"></A>which are useful in business are to be deemed necessary, and exist for 
<A NAME="94"></A>the sake of other things. And therefore our fathers admitted music into 
<A NAME="95"></A>education, not on the ground either of its necessity or utility, for it 
<A NAME="96"></A>is not necessary, nor indeed useful in the same manner as reading and writing, 
<A NAME="97"></A>which are useful in money-making, in the management of a household, in 
<A NAME="98"></A>the acquisition of knowledge and in political life, nor like drawing, useful 
<A NAME="99"></A>for a more correct judgment of the works of artists, nor again like gymnastic, 
<A NAME="100"></A>which gives health and strength; for neither of these is to be gained from 
<A NAME="101"></A>music. There remains, then, the use of music for intellectual enjoyment 
<A NAME="102"></A>in leisure; which is in fact evidently the reason of its introduction, 
<A NAME="103"></A>this being one of the ways in which it is thought that a freeman should 
<A NAME="104"></A>pass his leisure; as Homer says, <BR><BR>"But he who alone should be called 
<A NAME="105"></A>to the pleasant feast, "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="106"></A>and afterwards he speaks of others whom he describes as inviting <BR><BR>"The 
<A NAME="107"></A>bard who would delight them all. "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="108"></A>And in another place Odysseus says there is no better way of passing life 
<A NAME="109"></A>than when men's hearts are merry and
<A NAME="110"></A><BR><BR>The banqueters in the hall, sitting in order, hear the voice of 
<A NAME="111"></A>the minstrel.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>It is evident, then, that there is a sort of education in which 
<A NAME="113"></A>parents should train their sons, not as being useful or necessary, but 
<A NAME="114"></A>because it is liberal or noble. Whether this is of one kind only, or of 
<A NAME="115"></A>more than one, and if so, what they are, and how they are to be imparted, 
<A NAME="116"></A>must hereafter be determined. Thus much we are now in a position to say, 
<A NAME="117"></A>that the ancients witness to us; for their opinion may be gathered from 
<A NAME="118"></A>the fact that music is one of the received and traditional branches of 
<A NAME="119"></A>education. Further, it is clear that children should be instructed in some 
<A NAME="120"></A>useful things- for example, in reading and writing- not only for their 
<A NAME="121"></A>usefulness, but also because many other sorts of knowledge are acquired 
<A NAME="122"></A>through them. With a like view they may be taught drawing, not to prevent 
<A NAME="123"></A>their making mistakes in their own purchases, or in order that they may 
<A NAME="124"></A>not be imposed upon in the buying or selling of articles, but perhaps rather 
<A NAME="125"></A>because it makes them judges of the beauty of the human form. To be always 
<A NAME="126"></A>seeking after the useful does not become free and exalted souls. Now it 
<A NAME="127"></A>is clear that in education practice must be used before theory, and the 
<A NAME="128"></A>body be trained before the mind; and therefore boys should be handed over 
<A NAME="129"></A>to the trainer, who creates in them the roper habit of body, and to the 
<A NAME="130"></A>wrestling-master, who teaches them their exercises.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="131"></A><B>Part IV</B>

<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>Of those states which in our own day seem to take the greatest 
<A NAME="133"></A>care of children, some aim at producing in them an athletic habit, but 
<A NAME="134"></A>they only injure their forms and stunt their growth. Although the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="135"></A>have not fallen into this mistake, yet they brutalize their children by 
<A NAME="136"></A>laborious exercises which they think will make them courageous. But in 
<A NAME="137"></A>truth, as we have often repeated, education should not be exclusively, 
<A NAME="138"></A>or principally, directed to this end. And even if we suppose the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="139"></A>to be right in their end, they do not attain it. For among barbarians and 
<A NAME="140"></A>among animals courage is found associated, not with the greatest ferocity, 
<A NAME="141"></A>but with a gentle and lion like temper. There are many races who are ready 
<A NAME="142"></A>enough to kill and eat men, such as the Achaeans and Heniochi, who both 
<A NAME="143"></A>live about the Black Sea; and there are other mainland tribes, as bad or 
<A NAME="144"></A>worse, who all live by plunder, but have no courage. It is notorious that 
<A NAME="145"></A>the Lacedaemonians themselves, while they alone were assiduous in their 
<A NAME="146"></A>laborious drill, were superior to others, but now they are beaten both 
<A NAME="147"></A>in war and gymnastic exercises. For their ancient superiority did not depend 
<A NAME="148"></A>on their mode of training their youth, but only on the circumstance that 
<A NAME="149"></A>they trained them when their only rivals did not. Hence we may infer that 
<A NAME="150"></A>what is noble, not what is brutal, should have the first place; no wolf 
<A NAME="151"></A>or other wild animal will face a really noble danger; such dangers are 
<A NAME="152"></A>for the brave man. And parents who devote their children to gymnastics 
<A NAME="153"></A>while they neglect their necessary education, in reality vulgarize them; 
<A NAME="154"></A>for they make them useful to the art of statesmanship in one quality only, 
<A NAME="155"></A>and even in this the argument proves them to be inferior to others. We 
<A NAME="156"></A>should judge the Lacedaemonians not from what they have been, but from 
<A NAME="157"></A>what they are; for now they have rivals who compete with their education; 
<A NAME="158"></A>formerly they had none.
<A NAME="159"></A><BR><BR>It is an admitted principle, that gymnastic exercises should be 
<A NAME="160"></A>employed in education, and that for children they should be of a lighter 
<A NAME="161"></A>kind, avoiding severe diet or painful toil, lest the growth of the body 
<A NAME="162"></A>be impaired. The evil of excessive training in early years is strikingly 
<A NAME="163"></A>proved by the example of the Olympic victors; for not more than two or 
<A NAME="164"></A>three of them have gained a prize both as boys and as men; their early 
<A NAME="165"></A>training and severe gymnastic exercises exhausted their constitutions. 
<A NAME="166"></A>When boyhood is over, three years should be spent in other studies; the 
<A NAME="167"></A>period of life which follows may then be devoted to hard exercise and strict 
<A NAME="168"></A>diet. Men ought not to labor at the same time with their minds and with 
<A NAME="169"></A>their bodies; for the two kinds of labor are opposed to one another; the 
<A NAME="170"></A>labor of the body impedes the mind, and the labor of the mind the 
<A NAME="171"></A>body.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="172"></A><B>Part V</B>

<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>Concerning music there are some questions which we have already 
<A NAME="174"></A>raised; these we may now resume and carry further; and our remarks will 
<A NAME="175"></A>serve as a prelude to this or any other discussion of the subject. It is 
<A NAME="176"></A>not easy to determine the nature of music, or why any one should have a 
<A NAME="177"></A>knowledge of it. Shall we say, for the sake of amusement and relaxation, 
<A NAME="178"></A>like sleep or drinking, which are not good in themselves, but are pleasant, 
<A NAME="179"></A>and at the same time 'care to cease,' as Euripides says? And for this end 
<A NAME="180"></A>men also appoint music, and make use of all three alike- sleep, drinking, 
<A NAME="181"></A>music- to which some add dancing. Or shall we argue that music conduces 
<A NAME="182"></A>to virtue, on the ground that it can form our minds and habituate us to 
<A NAME="183"></A>true pleasures as our bodies are made by gymnastic to be of a certain character? 
<A NAME="184"></A>Or shall we say that it contributes to the enjoyment of leisure and mental 
<A NAME="185"></A>cultivation, which is a third alternative? Now obviously youths are not 
<A NAME="186"></A>to be instructed with a view to their amusement, for learning is no amusement, 
<A NAME="187"></A>but is accompanied with pain. Neither is intellectual enjoyment suitable 
<A NAME="188"></A>to boys of that age, for it is the end, and that which is imperfect cannot 
<A NAME="189"></A>attain the perfect or end. But perhaps it may be said that boys learn music 
<A NAME="190"></A>for the sake of the amusement which they will have when they are grown 
<A NAME="191"></A>up. If so, why should they learn themselves, and not, like the Persian 
<A NAME="192"></A>and Median kings, enjoy the pleasure and instruction which is derived from 
<A NAME="193"></A>hearing others? (for surely persons who have made music the business and 
<A NAME="194"></A>profession of their lives will be better performers than those who practice 
<A NAME="195"></A>only long enough to learn). If they must learn music, on the same principle 
<A NAME="196"></A>they should learn cookery, which is absurd. And even granting that music 
<A NAME="197"></A>may form the character, the objection still holds: why should we learn 
<A NAME="198"></A>ourselves? Why cannot we attain true pleasure and form a correct judgment 
<A NAME="199"></A>from hearing others, like the Lacedaemonians?- for they, without learning 
<A NAME="200"></A>music, nevertheless can correctly judge, as they say, of good and bad melodies. 
<A NAME="201"></A>Or again, if music should be used to promote cheerfulness and refined intellectual 
<A NAME="202"></A>enjoyment, the objection still remains- why should we learn ourselves instead 
<A NAME="203"></A>of enjoying the performances of others? We may illustrate what we are saying 
<A NAME="204"></A>by our conception of the Gods; for in the poets Zeus does not himself sing 
<A NAME="205"></A>or play on the lyre. Nay, we call professional performers vulgar; no freeman 
<A NAME="206"></A>would play or sing unless he were intoxicated or in jest. But these matters 
<A NAME="207"></A>may be left for the present.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>The first question is whether music is or is not to be a part of 
<A NAME="209"></A>education. Of the three things mentioned in our discussion, which does 
<A NAME="210"></A>it produce?- education or amusement or intellectual enjoyment, for it may 
<A NAME="211"></A>be reckoned under all three, and seems to share in the nature of all of 
<A NAME="212"></A>them. Amusement is for the sake of relaxation, and relaxation is of necessity 
<A NAME="213"></A>sweet, for it is the remedy of pain caused by toil; and intellectual enjoyment 
<A NAME="214"></A>is universally acknowledged to contain an element not only of the noble 
<A NAME="215"></A>but of the pleasant, for happiness is made up of both. All men agree that 
<A NAME="216"></A>music is one of the pleasantest things, whether with or without songs; 
<A NAME="217"></A>as Musaeus says: <BR><BR>"Song to mortals of all things the sweetest. 
<A NAME="218"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="219"></A>Hence and with good reason it is introduced into social gatherings and 
<A NAME="220"></A>entertainments, because it makes the hearts of men glad: so that on this 
<A NAME="221"></A>ground alone we may assume that the young ought to be trained in it. For 
<A NAME="222"></A>innocent pleasures are not only in harmony with the perfect end of life, 
<A NAME="223"></A>but they also provide relaxation. And whereas men rarely attain the end, 
<A NAME="224"></A>but often rest by the way and amuse themselves, not only with a view to 
<A NAME="225"></A>a further end, but also for the pleasure's sake, it may be well at times 
<A NAME="226"></A>to let them find a refreshment in music. It sometimes happens that men 
<A NAME="227"></A>make amusement the end, for the end probably contains some element of pleasure, 
<A NAME="228"></A>though not any ordinary or lower pleasure; but they mistake the lower for 
<A NAME="229"></A>the higher, and in seeking for the one find the other, since every pleasure 
<A NAME="230"></A>has a likeness to the end of action. For the end is not eligible for the 
<A NAME="231"></A>sake of any future good, nor do the pleasures which we have described exist 
<A NAME="232"></A>for the sake of any future good but of the past, that is to say, they are 
<A NAME="233"></A>the alleviation of past toils and pains. And we may infer this to be the 
<A NAME="234"></A>reason why men seek happiness from these pleasures.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>But music is pursued, not only as an alleviation of past toil, 
<A NAME="236"></A>but also as providing recreation. And who can say whether, having this 
<A NAME="237"></A>use, it may not also have a nobler one? In addition to this common pleasure, 
<A NAME="238"></A>felt and shared in by all (for the pleasure given by music is natural, 
<A NAME="239"></A>and therefore adapted to all ages and characters), may it not have also 
<A NAME="240"></A>some influence over the character and the soul? It must have such an influence 
<A NAME="241"></A>if characters are affected by it. And that they are so affected is proved 
<A NAME="242"></A>in many ways, and not least by the power which the songs of Olympus exercise; 
<A NAME="243"></A>for beyond question they inspire enthusiasm, and enthusiasm is an emotion 
<A NAME="244"></A>of the ethical part of the soul. Besides, when men hear imitations, even 
<A NAME="245"></A>apart from the rhythms and tunes themselves, their feelings move in sympathy. 
<A NAME="246"></A>Since then music is a pleasure, and virtue consists in rejoicing and loving 
<A NAME="247"></A>and hating aright, there is clearly nothing which we are so much concerned 
<A NAME="248"></A>to acquire and to cultivate as the power of forming right judgments, and 
<A NAME="249"></A>of taking delight in good dispositions and noble actions. Rhythm and melody 
<A NAME="250"></A>supply imitations of anger and gentleness, and also of courage and temperance, 
<A NAME="251"></A>and of all the qualities contrary to these, and of the other qualities 
<A NAME="252"></A>of character, which hardly fall short of the actual affections, as we know 
<A NAME="253"></A>from our own experience, for in listening to such strains our souls undergo 
<A NAME="254"></A>a change. The habit of feeling pleasure or pain at mere representations 
<A NAME="255"></A>is not far removed from the same feeling about realities; for example, 
<A NAME="256"></A>if any one delights in the sight of a statue for its beauty only, it necessarily 
<A NAME="257"></A>follows that the sight of the original will be pleasant to him. The objects 
<A NAME="258"></A>of no other sense, such as taste or touch, have any resemblance to moral 
<A NAME="259"></A>qualities; in visible objects there is only a little, for there are figures 
<A NAME="260"></A>which are of a moral character, but only to a slight extent, and all do 
<A NAME="261"></A>not participate in the feeling about them. Again, figures and colors are 
<A NAME="262"></A>not imitations, but signs, of moral habits, indications which the body 
<A NAME="263"></A>gives of states of feeling. The connection of them with morals is slight, 
<A NAME="264"></A>but in so far as there is any, young men should be taught to look, not 
<A NAME="265"></A>at the works of Pauson, but at those of Polygnotus, or any other painter 
<A NAME="266"></A>or sculptor who expresses moral ideas. On the other hand, even in mere 
<A NAME="267"></A>melodies there is an imitation of character, for the musical modes differ 
<A NAME="268"></A>essentially from one another, and those who hear them are differently affected 
<A NAME="269"></A>by each. Some of them make men sad and grave, like the so-called Mixolydian, 
<A NAME="270"></A>others enfeeble the mind, like the relaxed modes, another, again, produces 
<A NAME="271"></A>a moderate and settled temper, which appears to be the peculiar effect 
<A NAME="272"></A>of the Dorian; the Phrygian inspires enthusiasm. The whole subject has 
<A NAME="273"></A>been well treated by philosophical writers on this branch of education, 
<A NAME="274"></A>and they confirm their arguments by facts. The same principles apply to 
<A NAME="275"></A>rhythms; some have a character of rest, others of motion, and of these 
<A NAME="276"></A>latter again, some have a more vulgar, others a nobler movement. Enough 
<A NAME="277"></A>has been said to show that music has a power of forming the character, 
<A NAME="278"></A>and should therefore be introduced into the education of the young. The 
<A NAME="279"></A>study is suited to the stage of youth, for young persons will not, if they 
<A NAME="280"></A>can help, endure anything which is not sweetened by pleasure, and music 
<A NAME="281"></A>has a natural sweetness. There seems to be in us a sort of affinity to 
<A NAME="282"></A>musical modes and rhythms, which makes some philosophers say that the soul 
<A NAME="283"></A>is a tuning, others, that it possesses tuning.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="284"></A><B>Part VI</B>

<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>And now we have to determine the question which has been already 
<A NAME="286"></A>raised, whether children should be themselves taught to sing and play or 
<A NAME="287"></A>not. Clearly there is a considerable difference made in the character by 
<A NAME="288"></A>the actual practice of the art. It is difficult, if not impossible, for 
<A NAME="289"></A>those who do not perform to be good judges of the performance of others. 
<A NAME="290"></A>Besides, children should have something to do, and the rattle of Archytas, 
<A NAME="291"></A>which people give to their children in order to amuse them and prevent 
<A NAME="292"></A>them from breaking anything in the house, was a capital invention, for 
<A NAME="293"></A>a young thing cannot be quiet. The rattle is a toy suited to the infant 
<A NAME="294"></A>mind, and education is a rattle or toy for children of a larger growth. 
<A NAME="295"></A>We conclude then that they should be taught music in such a way as to become 
<A NAME="296"></A>not only critics but performers.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>The question what is or is not suitable for different ages may 
<A NAME="298"></A>be easily answered; nor is there any difficulty in meeting the objection 
<A NAME="299"></A>of those who say that the study of music is vulgar. We reply (1) in the 
<A NAME="300"></A>first place, that they who are to be judges must also be performers, and 
<A NAME="301"></A>that they should begin to practice early, although when they are older 
<A NAME="302"></A>they may be spared the execution; they must have learned to appreciate 
<A NAME="303"></A>what is good and to delight in it, thanks to the knowledge which they acquired 
<A NAME="304"></A>in their youth. As to (2) the vulgarizing effect which music is supposed 
<A NAME="305"></A>to exercise, this is a question which we shall have no difficulty in determining, 
<A NAME="306"></A>when we have considered to what extent freemen who are being trained to 
<A NAME="307"></A>political virtue should pursue the art, what melodies and what rhythms 
<A NAME="308"></A>they should be allowed to use, and what instruments should be employed 
<A NAME="309"></A>in teaching them to play; for even the instrument makes a difference. The 
<A NAME="310"></A>answer to the objection turns upon these distinctions; for it is quite 
<A NAME="311"></A>possible that certain methods of teaching and learning music do really 
<A NAME="312"></A>have a degrading effect. It is evident then that the learning of music 
<A NAME="313"></A>ought not to impede the business of riper years, or to degrade the body 
<A NAME="314"></A>or render it unfit for civil or military training, whether for bodily exercises 
<A NAME="315"></A>at the time or for later studies.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>The right measure will be attained if students of music stop short 
<A NAME="317"></A>of the arts which are practiced in professional contests, and do not seek 
<A NAME="318"></A>to acquire those fantastic marvels of execution which are now the fashion 
<A NAME="319"></A>in such contests, and from these have passed into education. Let the young 
<A NAME="320"></A>practice even such music as we have prescribed, only until they are able 
<A NAME="321"></A>to feel delight in noble melodies and rhythms, and not merely in that common 
<A NAME="322"></A>part of music in which every slave or child and even some animals find 
<A NAME="323"></A>pleasure.
<A NAME="324"></A><BR><BR>From these principles we may also infer what instruments should 
<A NAME="325"></A>be used. The flute, or any other instrument which requires great skill, 
<A NAME="326"></A>as for example the harp, ought not to be admitted into education, but only 
<A NAME="327"></A>such as will make intelligent students of music or of the other parts of 
<A NAME="328"></A>education. Besides, the flute is not an instrument which is expressive 
<A NAME="329"></A>of moral character; it is too exciting. The proper time for using it is 
<A NAME="330"></A>when the performance aims not at instruction, but at the relief of the 
<A NAME="331"></A>passions. And there is a further objection; the impediment which the flute 
<A NAME="332"></A>presents to the use of the voice detracts from its educational value. The 
<A NAME="333"></A>ancients therefore were right in forbidding the flute to youths and freemen, 
<A NAME="334"></A>although they had once allowed it. For when their wealth gave them a greater 
<A NAME="335"></A>inclination to leisure, and they had loftier notions of excellence, being 
<A NAME="336"></A>also elated with their success, both before and after the Persian War, 
<A NAME="337"></A>with more zeal than discernment they pursued every kind of knowledge, and 
<A NAME="338"></A>so they introduced the flute into education. At Lacedaemon there was a 
<A NAME="339"></A>choragus who led the chorus with a flute, and at Athens the instrument 
<A NAME="340"></A>became so popular that most freemen could play upon it. The popularity 
<A NAME="341"></A>is shown by the tablet which Thrasippus dedicated when he furnished the 
<A NAME="342"></A>chorus to Ecphantides. Later experience enabled men to judge what was or 
<A NAME="343"></A>was not really conducive to virtue, and they rejected both the flute and 
<A NAME="344"></A>several other old-fashioned instruments, such as the Lydian harp, the many-stringed 
<A NAME="345"></A>lyre, the 'heptagon,' 'triangle,' 'sambuca,' the like- which are intended 
<A NAME="346"></A>only to give pleasure to the hearer, and require extraordinary skill of 
<A NAME="347"></A>hand. There is a meaning also in the myth of the ancients, which tells 
<A NAME="348"></A>how Athene invented the flute and then threw it away. It was not a bad 
<A NAME="349"></A>idea of theirs, that the Goddess disliked the instrument because it made 
<A NAME="350"></A>the face ugly; but with still more reason may we say that she rejected 
<A NAME="351"></A>it because the acquirement of flute-playing contributes nothing to the 
<A NAME="352"></A>mind, since to Athene we ascribe both knowledge and 
<A NAME="353"></A>art.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>Thus then we reject the professional instruments and also the professional 
<A NAME="355"></A>mode of education in music (and by professional we mean that which is adopted 
<A NAME="356"></A>in contests), for in this the performer practices the art, not for the 
<A NAME="357"></A>sake of his own improvement, but in order to give pleasure, and that of 
<A NAME="358"></A>a vulgar sort, to his hearers. For this reason the execution of such music 
<A NAME="359"></A>is not the part of a freeman but of a paid performer, and the result is 
<A NAME="360"></A>that the performers are vulgarized, for the end at which they aim is bad. 
<A NAME="361"></A>The vulgarity of the spectator tends to lower the character of the music 
<A NAME="362"></A>and therefore of the performers; they look to him- he makes them what they 
<A NAME="363"></A>are, and fashions even their bodies by the movements which he expects them 
<A NAME="364"></A>to exhibit.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="365"></A><B>Part VII</B>

<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>We have also to consider rhythms and modes, and their use in education. 
<A NAME="367"></A>Shall we use them all or make a distinction? and shall the same distinction 
<A NAME="368"></A>be made for those who practice music with a view to education, or shall 
<A NAME="369"></A>it be some other? Now we see that music is produced by melody and rhythm, 
<A NAME="370"></A>and we ought to know what influence these have respectively on education, 
<A NAME="371"></A>and whether we should prefer excellence in melody or excellence in rhythm. 
<A NAME="372"></A>But as the subject has been very well treated by many musicians of the 
<A NAME="373"></A>present day, and also by philosophers who have had considerable experience 
<A NAME="374"></A>of musical education, to these we would refer the more exact student of 
<A NAME="375"></A>the subject; we shall only speak of it now after the manner of the legislator, 
<A NAME="376"></A>stating the general principles.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>We accept the division of melodies proposed by certain philosophers 
<A NAME="378"></A>into ethical melodies, melodies of action, and passionate or inspiring 
<A NAME="379"></A>melodies, each having, as they say, a mode corresponding to it. But we 
<A NAME="380"></A>maintain further that music should be studied, not for the sake of one, 
<A NAME="381"></A>but of many benefits, that is to say, with a view to (1) education, (2) 
<A NAME="382"></A>purgation (the word 'purgation' we use at present without explanation, 
<A NAME="383"></A>but when hereafter we speak of poetry, we will treat the subject with more 
<A NAME="384"></A>precision); music may also serve (3) for for enjoyment, for relaxation, 
<A NAME="385"></A>and for recreation after exertion. It is clear, therefore, that all the 
<A NAME="386"></A>modes must be employed by us, but not all of them in the same manner. In 
<A NAME="387"></A>education the most ethical modes are to be preferred, but in listening 
<A NAME="388"></A>to the performances of others we may admit the modes of action and passion 
<A NAME="389"></A>also. For feelings such as pity and fear, or, again, enthusiasm, exist 
<A NAME="390"></A>very strongly in some souls, and have more or less influence over all. 
<A NAME="391"></A>Some persons fall into a religious frenzy, whom we see as a result of the 
<A NAME="392"></A>sacred melodies- when they have used the melodies that excite the soul 
<A NAME="393"></A>to mystic frenzy- restored as though they had found healing and purgation. 
<A NAME="394"></A>Those who are influenced by pity or fear, and every emotional nature, must 
<A NAME="395"></A>have a like experience, and others in so far as each is susceptible to 
<A NAME="396"></A>such emotions, and all are in a manner purged and their souls lightened 
<A NAME="397"></A>and delighted. The purgative melodies likewise give an innocent pleasure 
<A NAME="398"></A>to mankind. Such are the modes and the melodies in which those who perform 
<A NAME="399"></A>music at the theater should be invited to compete. But since the spectators 
<A NAME="400"></A>are of two kinds- the one free and educated, and the other a vulgar crowd 
<A NAME="401"></A>composed of mechanics, laborers, and the like- there ought to be contests 
<A NAME="402"></A>and exhibitions instituted for the relaxation of the second class also. 
<A NAME="403"></A>And the music will correspond to their minds; for as their minds are perverted 
<A NAME="404"></A>from the natural state, so there are perverted modes and highly strung 
<A NAME="405"></A>and unnaturally colored melodies. A man receives pleasure from what is 
<A NAME="406"></A>natural to him, and therefore professional musicians may be allowed to 
<A NAME="407"></A>practice this lower sort of music before an audience of a lower type. But, 
<A NAME="408"></A>for the purposes of education, as I have already said, those modes and 
<A NAME="409"></A>melodies should be employed which are ethical, such as the Dorian, as we 
<A NAME="410"></A>said before; though we may include any others which are approved by philosophers 
<A NAME="411"></A>who have had a musical education. The Socrates of the Republic is wrong 
<A NAME="412"></A>in retaining only the Phrygian mode along with the Dorian, and the more 
<A NAME="413"></A>so because he rejects the flute; for the Phrygian is to the modes what 
<A NAME="414"></A>the flute is to musical instruments- both of them are exciting and emotional. 
<A NAME="415"></A>Poetry proves this, for Bacchic frenzy and all similar emotions are most 
<A NAME="416"></A>suitably expressed by the flute, and are better set to the Phrygian than 
<A NAME="417"></A>to any other mode. The dithyramb, for example, is acknowledged to be Phrygian, 
<A NAME="418"></A>a fact of which the connoisseurs of music offer many proofs, saying, among 
<A NAME="419"></A>other things, that Philoxenus, having attempted to compose his Mysians 
<A NAME="420"></A>as a dithyramb in the Dorian mode, found it impossible, and fell back by 
<A NAME="421"></A>the very nature of things into the more appropriate Phrygian. All men agree 
<A NAME="422"></A>that the Dorian music is the gravest and manliest. And whereas we say that 
<A NAME="423"></A>the extremes should be avoided and the mean followed, and whereas the Dorian 
<A NAME="424"></A>is a mean between the other modes, it is evident that our youth should 
<A NAME="425"></A>be taught the Dorian music.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>Two principles have to be kept in view, what is possible, what 
<A NAME="427"></A>is becoming: at these every man ought to aim. But even these are relative 
<A NAME="428"></A>to age; the old, who have lost their powers, cannot very well sing the 
<A NAME="429"></A>high-strung modes, and nature herself seems to suggest that their songs 
<A NAME="430"></A>should be of the more relaxed kind. Wherefore the musicians likewise blame 
<A NAME="431"></A>Socrates, and with justice, for rejecting the relaxed modes in education 
<A NAME="432"></A>under the idea that they are intoxicating, not in the ordinary sense of 
<A NAME="433"></A>intoxication (for wine rather tends to excite men), but because they have 
<A NAME="434"></A>no strength in them. And so, with a view also to the time of life when 
<A NAME="435"></A>men begin to grow old, they ought to practice the gentler modes and melodies 
<A NAME="436"></A>as well as the others, and, further, any mode, such as the Lydian above 
<A NAME="437"></A>all others appears to be, which is suited to children of tender age, and 
<A NAME="438"></A>possesses the elements both of order and of education. Thus it is clear 
<A NAME="439"></A>that education should be based upon three principles- the mean, the possible, 
<A NAME="440"></A>the becoming, these three.
