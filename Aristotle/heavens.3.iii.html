<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>We have already discussed the first heaven and its parts, the moving stars 
<A NAME="12"></A>within it, the matter of which these are composed and their bodily constitution, 
<A NAME="13"></A>and we have also shown that they are ungenerated and indestructible. Now 
<A NAME="14"></A>things that we call natural are either substances or functions and attributes 
<A NAME="15"></A>of substances. As substances I class the simple bodies-fire, earth, and 
<A NAME="16"></A>the other terms of the series-and all things composed of them; for example, 
<A NAME="17"></A>the heaven as a whole and its parts, animals, again, and plants and their 
<A NAME="18"></A>parts. By attributes and functions I mean the movements of these and of 
<A NAME="19"></A>all other things in which they have power in themselves to cause movement, 
<A NAME="20"></A>and also their alterations and reciprocal transformations. It is obvious, 
<A NAME="21"></A>then, that the greater part of the inquiry into nature concerns bodies: 
<A NAME="22"></A>for a natural substance is either a body or a thing which cannot come into 
<A NAME="23"></A>existence without body and magnitude. This appears plainly from an analysis 
<A NAME="24"></A>of the character of natural things, and equally from an inspection of the 
<A NAME="25"></A>instances of inquiry into nature. Since, then, we have spoken of the primary 
<A NAME="26"></A>element, of its bodily constitution, and of its freedom from destruction 
<A NAME="27"></A>and generation, it remains to speak of the other two. In speaking of them 
<A NAME="28"></A>we shall be obliged also to inquire into generation and destruction. For 
<A NAME="29"></A>if there is generation anywhere, it must be in these elements and things 
<A NAME="30"></A>composed of them.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>This is indeed the first question we have to ask: is generation 
<A NAME="32"></A>a fact or not? Earlier speculation was at variance both with itself and 
<A NAME="33"></A>with the views here put forward as to the true answer to this question. 
<A NAME="34"></A>Some removed generation and destruction from the world altogether. Nothing 
<A NAME="35"></A>that is, they said, is generated or destroyed, and our conviction to the 
<A NAME="36"></A>contrary is an illusion. So maintained the school of Melissus and Parmenides. 
<A NAME="37"></A>But however excellent their theories may otherwise be, anyhow they cannot 
<A NAME="38"></A>be held to speak as students of nature. There may be things not subject 
<A NAME="39"></A>to generation or any kind of movement, but if so they belong to another 
<A NAME="40"></A>and a higher inquiry than the study of nature. They, however, had no idea 
<A NAME="41"></A>of any form of being other than the substance of things perceived; and 
<A NAME="42"></A>when they saw, what no one previously had seen, that there could be no 
<A NAME="43"></A>knowledge or wisdom without some such unchanging entities, they naturally 
<A NAME="44"></A>transferred what was true of them to things perceived. Others, perhaps 
<A NAME="45"></A>intentionally, maintain precisely the contrary opinion to this. It has 
<A NAME="46"></A>been asserted that everything in the world was subject to generation and 
<A NAME="47"></A>nothing was ungenerated, but that after being generated some things remained 
<A NAME="48"></A>indestructible while the rest were again destroyed. This had been asserted 
<A NAME="49"></A>in the first instance by Hesiod and his followers, but afterwards outside 
<A NAME="50"></A>his circle by the earliest natural philosophers. But what these thinkers 
<A NAME="51"></A>maintained was that all else has been generated and, as they said, 'is 
<A NAME="52"></A>flowing away, nothing having any solidity, except one single thing which 
<A NAME="53"></A>persists as the basis of all these transformations. So we may interpret 
<A NAME="54"></A>the statements of Heraclitus of Ephesus and many others. And some subject 
<A NAME="55"></A>all bodies whatever to generation, by means of the composition and separation 
<A NAME="56"></A>of planes.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>Discussion of the other views may be postponed. But this last theory 
<A NAME="58"></A>which composes every body of planes is, as the most superficial observation 
<A NAME="59"></A>shows, in many respects in plain contradiction with mathematics. It is, 
<A NAME="60"></A>however, wrong to remove the foundations of a science unless you can replace 
<A NAME="61"></A>them with others more convincing. And, secondly, the same theory which 
<A NAME="62"></A>composes solids of planes clearly composes planes of lines and lines of 
<A NAME="63"></A>points, so that a part of a line need not be a line. This matter has been 
<A NAME="64"></A>already considered in our discussion of movement, where we have shown that 
<A NAME="65"></A>an indivisible length is impossible. But with respect to natural bodies 
<A NAME="66"></A>there are impossibilities involved in the view which asserts indivisible 
<A NAME="67"></A>lines, which we may briefly consider at this point. For the impossible 
<A NAME="68"></A>consequences which result from this view in the mathematical sphere will 
<A NAME="69"></A>reproduce themselves when it is applied to physical bodies, but there will 
<A NAME="70"></A>be difficulties in physics which are not present in mathematics; for mathematics 
<A NAME="71"></A>deals with an abstract and physics with a more concrete object. There are 
<A NAME="72"></A>many attributes necessarily present in physical bodies which are necessarily 
<A NAME="73"></A>excluded by indivisibility; all attributes, in fact, which are divisible. 
<A NAME="74"></A>There can be nothing divisible in an indivisible thing, but the attributes 
<A NAME="75"></A>of bodies are all divisible in one of two ways. They are divisible into 
<A NAME="76"></A>kinds, as colour is divided into white and black, and they are divisible 
<A NAME="77"></A>per accidens when that which has them is divisible. In this latter sense 
<A NAME="78"></A>attributes which are simple are nevertheless divisible. Attributes of this 
<A NAME="79"></A>kind will serve, therefore, to illustrate the impossibility of the view. 
<A NAME="80"></A>It is impossible, if two parts of a thing have no weight, that the two 
<A NAME="81"></A>together should have weight. But either all perceptible bodies or some, 
<A NAME="82"></A>such as earth and water, have weight, as these thinkers would themselves 
<A NAME="83"></A>admit. Now if the point has no weight, clearly the lines have not either, 
<A NAME="84"></A>and, if they have not, neither have the planes. Therefore no body has weight. 
<A NAME="85"></A>It is, further, manifest that their point cannot have weight. For while 
<A NAME="86"></A>a heavy thing may always be heavier than something and a light thing lighter 
<A NAME="87"></A>than something, a thing which is heavier or lighter than something need 
<A NAME="88"></A>not be itself heavy or light, just as a large thing is larger than others, 
<A NAME="89"></A>but what is larger is not always large. A thing which, judged absolutely, 
<A NAME="90"></A>is small may none the less be larger than other things. Whatever, then, 
<A NAME="91"></A>is heavy and also heavier than something else, must exceed this by something 
<A NAME="92"></A>which is heavy. A heavy thing therefore is always divisible. But it is 
<A NAME="93"></A>common ground that a point is indivisible. Again, suppose that what is 
<A NAME="94"></A>heavy or weight is a dense body, and what is light rare. Dense differs 
<A NAME="95"></A>from rare in containing more matter in the same cubic area. A point, then, 
<A NAME="96"></A>if it may be heavy or light, may be dense or rare. But the dense is divisible 
<A NAME="97"></A>while a point is indivisible. And if what is heavy must be either hard 
<A NAME="98"></A>or soft, an impossible consequence is easy to draw. For a thing is soft 
<A NAME="99"></A>if its surface can be pressed in, hard if it cannot; and if it can be pressed 
<A NAME="100"></A>in it is divisible.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, no weight can consist of parts not possessing weight. 
<A NAME="102"></A>For how, except by the merest fiction, can they specify the number and 
<A NAME="103"></A>character of the parts which will produce weight? And, further, when one 
<A NAME="104"></A>weight is greater than another, the difference is a third weight; from 
<A NAME="105"></A>which it will follow that every indivisible part possesses weight. For 
<A NAME="106"></A>suppose that a body of four points possesses weight. A body composed of 
<A NAME="107"></A>more than four points will superior in weight to it, a thing which has 
<A NAME="108"></A>weight. But the difference between weight and weight must be a weight, 
<A NAME="109"></A>as the difference between white and whiter is white. Here the difference 
<A NAME="110"></A>which makes the superior weight heavier is the single point which remains 
<A NAME="111"></A>when the common number, four, is subtracted. A single point, therefore, 
<A NAME="112"></A>has weight.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>Further, to assume, on the one hand, that the planes can only be 
<A NAME="114"></A>put in linear contact would be ridiculous. For just as there are two ways 
<A NAME="115"></A>of putting lines together, namely, end to and side by side, so there must 
<A NAME="116"></A>be two ways of putting planes together. Lines can be put together so that 
<A NAME="117"></A>contact is linear by laying one along the other, though not by putting 
<A NAME="118"></A>them end to end. But if, similarly, in putting the lanes together, superficial 
<A NAME="119"></A>contact is allowed as an alternative to linear, that method will give them 
<A NAME="120"></A>bodies which are not any element nor composed of elements. Again, if it 
<A NAME="121"></A>is the number of planes in a body that makes one heavier than another, 
<A NAME="122"></A>as the Timaeus explains, clearly the line and the point will have weight. 
<A NAME="123"></A>For the three cases are, as we said before, analogous. But if the reason 
<A NAME="124"></A>of differences of weight is not this, but rather the heaviness of earth 
<A NAME="125"></A>and the lightness of fire, then some of the planes will be light and others 
<A NAME="126"></A>heavy (which involves a similar distinction in the lines and the points); 
<A NAME="127"></A>the earthplane, I mean, will be heavier than the fire-plane. In general, 
<A NAME="128"></A>the result is either that there is no magnitude at all, or that all magnitude 
<A NAME="129"></A>could be done away with. For a point is to a line as a line is to a plane 
<A NAME="130"></A>and as a plane is to a body. Now the various forms in passing into one 
<A NAME="131"></A>another will each be resolved into its ultimate constituents. It might 
<A NAME="132"></A>happen therefore that nothing existed except points, and that there was 
<A NAME="133"></A>no body at all. A further consideration is that if time is similarly constituted, 
<A NAME="134"></A>there would be, or might be, a time at which it was done away with. For 
<A NAME="135"></A>the indivisible now is like a point in a line. The same consequences follow 
<A NAME="136"></A>from composing the heaven of numbers, as some of the Pythagoreans do who 
<A NAME="137"></A>make all nature out of numbers. For natural bodies are manifestly endowed 
<A NAME="138"></A>with weight and lightness, but an assemblage of units can neither be composed 
<A NAME="139"></A>to form a body nor possess weight.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="140"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>The necessity that each of the simple bodies should have a natural 
<A NAME="142"></A>movement may be shown as follows. They manifestly move, and if they have 
<A NAME="143"></A>no proper movement they must move by constraint: and the constrained is 
<A NAME="144"></A>the same as the unnatural. Now an unnatural movement presupposes a natural 
<A NAME="145"></A>movement which it contravenes, and which, however many the unnatural movements, 
<A NAME="146"></A>is always one. For naturally a thing moves in one way, while its unnatural 
<A NAME="147"></A>movements are manifold. The same may be shown, from the fact of rest. Rest, 
<A NAME="148"></A>also, must either be constrained or natural, constrained in a place to 
<A NAME="149"></A>which movement was constrained, natural in a place movement to which was 
<A NAME="150"></A>natural. Now manifestly there is a body which is at rest at the centre. 
<A NAME="151"></A>If then this rest is natural to it, clearly motion to this place is natural 
<A NAME="152"></A>to it. If, on the other hand, its rest is constrained, what is hindering 
<A NAME="153"></A>its motion? Something, which is at rest: but if so, we shall simply repeat 
<A NAME="154"></A>the same argument; and either we shall come to an ultimate something to 
<A NAME="155"></A>which rest where it is or we shall have an infinite process, which is impossible. 
<A NAME="156"></A>The hindrance to its movement, then, we will suppose, is a moving thing-as 
<A NAME="157"></A>Empedocles says that it is the vortex which keeps the earth still-: but 
<A NAME="158"></A>in that case we ask, where would it have moved to but for the vortex? It 
<A NAME="159"></A>could not move infinitely; for to traverse an infinite is impossible, and 
<A NAME="160"></A>impossibilities do not happen. So the moving thing must stop somewhere, 
<A NAME="161"></A>and there rest not by constraint but naturally. But a natural rest proves 
<A NAME="162"></A>a natural movement to the place of rest. Hence Leucippus and Democritus, 
<A NAME="163"></A>who say that the primary bodies are in perpetual movement in the void or 
<A NAME="164"></A>infinite, may be asked to explain the manner of their motion and the kind 
<A NAME="165"></A>of movement which is natural to them. For if the various elements are constrained 
<A NAME="166"></A>by one another to move as they do, each must still have a natural movement 
<A NAME="167"></A>which the constrained contravenes, and the prime mover must cause motion 
<A NAME="168"></A>not by constraint but naturally. If there is no ultimate natural cause 
<A NAME="169"></A>of movement and each preceding term in the series is always moved by constraint, 
<A NAME="170"></A>we shall have an infinite process. The same difficulty is involved even 
<A NAME="171"></A>if it is supposed, as we read in the Timaeus, that before the ordered world 
<A NAME="172"></A>was made the elements moved without order. Their movement must have been 
<A NAME="173"></A>due either to constraint or to their nature. And if their movement was 
<A NAME="174"></A>natural, a moment's consideration shows that there was already an ordered 
<A NAME="175"></A>world. For the prime mover must cause motion in virtue of its own natural 
<A NAME="176"></A>movement, and the other bodies, moving without constraint, as they came 
<A NAME="177"></A>to rest in their proper places, would fall into the order in which they 
<A NAME="178"></A>now stand, the heavy bodies moving towards the centre and the light bodies 
<A NAME="179"></A>away from it. But that is the order of their distribution in our world. 
<A NAME="180"></A>There is a further question, too, which might be asked. Is it possible 
<A NAME="181"></A>or impossible that bodies in unordered movement should combine in some 
<A NAME="182"></A>cases into combinations like those of which bodies of nature's composing 
<A NAME="183"></A>are composed, such, I mean, as bones and flesh? Yet this is what Empedocles 
<A NAME="184"></A>asserts to have occurred under Love. 'Many a head', says he, 'came to birth 
<A NAME="185"></A>without a neck.' The answer to the view that there are infinite bodies 
<A NAME="186"></A>moving in an infinite is that, if the cause of movement is single, they 
<A NAME="187"></A>must move with a single motion, and therefore not without order; and if, 
<A NAME="188"></A>on the other hand, the causes are of infinite variety, their motions too 
<A NAME="189"></A>must be infinitely varied. For a finite number of causes would produce 
<A NAME="190"></A>a kind of order, since absence of order is not proved by diversity of direction 
<A NAME="191"></A>in motions: indeed, in the world we know, not all bodies, but only bodies 
<A NAME="192"></A>of the same kind, have a common goal of movement. Again, disorderly movement 
<A NAME="193"></A>means in reality unnatural movement, since the order proper to perceptible 
<A NAME="194"></A>things is their nature. And there is also absurdity and impossibility in 
<A NAME="195"></A>the notion that the disorderly movement is infinitely continued. For the 
<A NAME="196"></A>nature of things is the nature which most of them possess for most of the 
<A NAME="197"></A>time. Thus their view brings them into the contrary position that disorder 
<A NAME="198"></A>is natural, and order or system unnatural. But no natural fact can originate 
<A NAME="199"></A>in chance. This is a point which Anaxagoras seems to have thoroughly grasped; 
<A NAME="200"></A>for he starts his cosmogony from unmoved things. The others, it is true, 
<A NAME="201"></A>make things collect together somehow before they try to produce motion 
<A NAME="202"></A>and separation. But there is no sense in starting generation from an original 
<A NAME="203"></A>state in which bodies are separated and in movement. Hence Empedocles begins 
<A NAME="204"></A>after the process ruled by Love: for he could not have constructed the 
<A NAME="205"></A>heaven by building it up out of bodies in separation, making them to combine 
<A NAME="206"></A>by the power of Love, since our world has its constituent elements in separation, 
<A NAME="207"></A>and therefore presupposes a previous state of unity and 
<A NAME="208"></A>combination.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>These arguments make it plain that every body has its natural movement, 
<A NAME="210"></A>which is not constrained or contrary to its nature. We go on to show that 
<A NAME="211"></A>there are certain bodies whose necessary impetus is that of weight and 
<A NAME="212"></A>lightness. Of necessity, we assert, they must move, and a moved thing which 
<A NAME="213"></A>has no natural impetus cannot move either towards or away from the centre. 
<A NAME="214"></A>Suppose a body A without weight, and a body B endowed with weight. Suppose 
<A NAME="215"></A>the weightless body to move the distance CD, while B in the same time moves 
<A NAME="216"></A>the distance Ce, which will be greater since the heavy thing must move 
<A NAME="217"></A>further. Let the heavy body then be divided in the proportion CE: CD (for 
<A NAME="218"></A>there is no reason why a part of B should not stand in this relation to 
<A NAME="219"></A>the whole). Now if the whole moves the whole distance CE, the part must 
<A NAME="220"></A>in the same time move the distance CD. A weightless body, therefore, and 
<A NAME="221"></A>one which has weight will move the same distance, which is impossible. 
<A NAME="222"></A>And the same argument would fit the case of lightness. Again, a body which 
<A NAME="223"></A>is in motion but has neither weight nor lightness, must be moved by constraint, 
<A NAME="224"></A>and must continue its constrained movement infinitely. For there will be 
<A NAME="225"></A>a force which moves it, and the smaller and lighter a body is the further 
<A NAME="226"></A>will a given force move it. Now let A, the weightless body, be moved the 
<A NAME="227"></A>distance Ce, and B, which has weight, be moved in the same time the distance 
<A NAME="228"></A>Cd. Dividing the heavy body in the proportion CE:CD, we subtract from the 
<A NAME="229"></A>heavy body a part which will in the same time move the distance CE, since 
<A NAME="230"></A>the whole moved CD: for the relative speeds of the two bodies will be in 
<A NAME="231"></A>inverse ratio to their respective sizes. Thus the weightless body will 
<A NAME="232"></A>move the same distance as the heavy in the same time. But this is impossible. 
<A NAME="233"></A>Hence, since the motion of the weightless body will cover a greater distance 
<A NAME="234"></A>than any that is suggested, it will continue infinitely. It is therefore 
<A NAME="235"></A>obvious that every body must have a definite weight or lightness. But since 
<A NAME="236"></A>'nature' means a source of movement within the thing itself, while a force 
<A NAME="237"></A>is a source of movement in something other than it or in itself qua other, 
<A NAME="238"></A>and since movement is always due either to nature or to constraint, movement 
<A NAME="239"></A>which is natural, as downward movement is to a stone, will be merely accelerated 
<A NAME="240"></A>by an external force, while an unnatural movement will be due to the force 
<A NAME="241"></A>alone. In either case the air is as it were instrumental to the force. 
<A NAME="242"></A>For air is both light and heavy, and thus qua light produces upward motion, 
<A NAME="243"></A>being propelled and set in motion by the force, and qua heavy produces 
<A NAME="244"></A>a downward motion. In either case the force transmits the movement to the 
<A NAME="245"></A>body by first, as it were, impregnating the air. That is why a body moved 
<A NAME="246"></A>by constraint continues to move when that which gave the impulse ceases 
<A NAME="247"></A>to accompany it. Otherwise, i.e. if the air were not endowed with this 
<A NAME="248"></A>function, constrained movement would be impossible. And the natural movement 
<A NAME="249"></A>of a body may be helped on in the same way. This discussion suffices to 
<A NAME="250"></A>show (1) that all bodies are either light or heavy, and (2) how unnatural 
<A NAME="251"></A>movement takes place.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>From what has been said earlier it is plain that there cannot be 
<A NAME="253"></A>generation either of everything or in an absolute sense of anything. It 
<A NAME="254"></A>is impossible that everything should be generated, unless an extra-corporeal 
<A NAME="255"></A>void is possible. For, assuming generation, the place which is to be occupied 
<A NAME="256"></A>by that which is coming to be, must have been previously occupied by void 
<A NAME="257"></A>in which no body was. Now it is quite possible for one body to be generated 
<A NAME="258"></A>out of another, air for instance out of fire, but in the absence of any 
<A NAME="259"></A>pre-existing mass generation is impossible. That which is potentially a 
<A NAME="260"></A>certain kind of body may, it is true, become such in actuality, But if 
<A NAME="261"></A>the potential body was not already in actuality some other kind of body, 
<A NAME="262"></A>the existence of an extra-corporeal void must be admitted.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="263"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>It remains to say what bodies are subject to generation, and why. 
<A NAME="265"></A>Since in every case knowledge depends on what is primary, and the elements 
<A NAME="266"></A>are the primary constituents of bodies, we must ask which of such bodies 
<A NAME="267"></A>are elements, and why; and after that what is their number and character. 
<A NAME="268"></A>The answer will be plain if we first explain what kind of substance an 
<A NAME="269"></A>element is. An element, we take it, is a body into which other bodies may 
<A NAME="270"></A>be analysed, present in them potentially or in actuality (which of these, 
<A NAME="271"></A>is still disputable), and not itself divisible into bodies different in 
<A NAME="272"></A>form. That, or something like it, is what all men in every case mean by 
<A NAME="273"></A>element. Now if what we have described is an element, clearly there must 
<A NAME="274"></A>be such bodies. For flesh and wood and all other similar bodies contain 
<A NAME="275"></A>potentially fire and earth, since one sees these elements exuded from them; 
<A NAME="276"></A>and, on the other hand, neither in potentiality nor in actuality does fire 
<A NAME="277"></A>contain flesh or wood, or it would exude them. Similarly, even if there 
<A NAME="278"></A>were only one elementary body, it would not contain them. For though it 
<A NAME="279"></A>will be either flesh or bone or something else, that does not at once show 
<A NAME="280"></A>that it contained these in potentiality: the further question remains, 
<A NAME="281"></A>in what manner it becomes them. Now Anaxagoras opposes Empedocles' view 
<A NAME="282"></A>of the elements. Empedocles says that fire and earth and the related bodies 
<A NAME="283"></A>are elementary bodies of which all things are composed; but this Anaxagoras 
<A NAME="284"></A>denies. His elements are the homoeomerous things, viz. flesh, bone, and 
<A NAME="285"></A>the like. Earth and fire are mixtures, composed of them and all the other 
<A NAME="286"></A>seeds, each consisting of a collection of all the homoeomerous bodies, 
<A NAME="287"></A>separately invisible; and that explains why from these two bodies all others 
<A NAME="288"></A>are generated. (To him fire and aither are the same thing.) But since every 
<A NAME="289"></A>natural body has it proper movement, and movements are either simple or 
<A NAME="290"></A>mixed, mixed in mixed bodies and simple in simple, there must obviously 
<A NAME="291"></A>be simple bodies; for there are simple movements. It is plain, then, that 
<A NAME="292"></A>there are elements, and why.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="293"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>The next question to consider is whether the elements are finite 
<A NAME="295"></A>or infinite in number, and, if finite, what their number is. Let us first 
<A NAME="296"></A>show reason or denying that their number is infinite, as some suppose. 
<A NAME="297"></A>We begin with the view of Anaxagoras that all the homoeomerous bodies are 
<A NAME="298"></A>elements. Any one who adopts this view misapprehends the meaning of element. 
<A NAME="299"></A>Observation shows that even mixed bodies are often divisible into homoeomerous 
<A NAME="300"></A>parts; examples are flesh, bone, wood, and stone. Since then the composite 
<A NAME="301"></A>cannot be an element, not every homoeomerous body can be an element; only, 
<A NAME="302"></A>as we said before, that which is not divisible into bodies different in 
<A NAME="303"></A>form. But even taking 'element' as they do, they need not assert an infinity 
<A NAME="304"></A>of elements, since the hypothesis of a finite number will give identical 
<A NAME="305"></A>results. Indeed even two or three such bodies serve the purpose as well, 
<A NAME="306"></A>as Empedocles' attempt shows. Again, even on their view it turns out that 
<A NAME="307"></A>all things are not composed of homocomerous bodies. They do not pretend 
<A NAME="308"></A>that a face is composed of faces, or that any other natural conformation 
<A NAME="309"></A>is composed of parts like itself. Obviously then it would be better to 
<A NAME="310"></A>assume a finite number of principles. They should, in fact, be as few as 
<A NAME="311"></A>possible, consistently with proving what has to be proved. This is the 
<A NAME="312"></A>common demand of mathematicians, who always assume as principles things 
<A NAME="313"></A>finite either in kind or in number. Again, if body is distinguished from 
<A NAME="314"></A>body by the appropriate qualitative difference, and there is a limit to 
<A NAME="315"></A>the number of differences (for the difference lies in qualities apprehended 
<A NAME="316"></A>by sense, which are in fact finite in number, though this requires proof), 
<A NAME="317"></A>then manifestly there is necessarily a limit to the number of 
<A NAME="318"></A>elements.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>There is, further, another view-that of Leucippus and Democritus 
<A NAME="320"></A>of Abdera-the implications of which are also unacceptable. The primary 
<A NAME="321"></A>masses, according to them, are infinite in number and indivisible in mass: 
<A NAME="322"></A>one cannot turn into many nor many into one; and all things are generated 
<A NAME="323"></A>by their combination and involution. Now this view in a sense makes things 
<A NAME="324"></A>out to be numbers or composed of numbers. The exposition is not clear, 
<A NAME="325"></A>but this is its real meaning. And further, they say that since the atomic 
<A NAME="326"></A>bodies differ in shape, and there is an infinity of shapes, there is an 
<A NAME="327"></A>infinity of simple bodies. But they have never explained in detail the 
<A NAME="328"></A>shapes of the various elements, except so far to allot the sphere to fire. 
<A NAME="329"></A>Air, water, and the rest they distinguished by the relative size of the 
<A NAME="330"></A>atom, assuming that the atomic substance was a sort of master-seed for 
<A NAME="331"></A>each and every element. Now, in the first place, they make the mistake 
<A NAME="332"></A>already noticed. The principles which they assume are not limited in number, 
<A NAME="333"></A>though such limitation would necessitate no other alteration in their theory. 
<A NAME="334"></A>Further, if the differences of bodies are not infinite, plainly the elements 
<A NAME="335"></A>will not be an infinity. Besides, a view which asserts atomic bodies must 
<A NAME="336"></A>needs come into conflict with the mathematical sciences, in addition to 
<A NAME="337"></A>invalidating many common opinions and apparent data of sense perception. 
<A NAME="338"></A>But of these things we have already spoken in our discussion of time and 
<A NAME="339"></A>movement. They are also bound to contradict themselves. For if the elements 
<A NAME="340"></A>are atomic, air, earth, and water cannot be differentiated by the relative 
<A NAME="341"></A>sizes of their atoms, since then they could not be generated out of one 
<A NAME="342"></A>another. The extrusion of the largest atoms is a process that will in time 
<A NAME="343"></A>exhaust the supply; and it is by such a process that they account for the 
<A NAME="344"></A>generation of water, air, and earth from one another. Again, even on their 
<A NAME="345"></A>own presuppositions it does not seem as if the clements would be infinite 
<A NAME="346"></A>in number. The atoms differ in figure, and all figures are composed of 
<A NAME="347"></A>pyramids, rectilinear the case of rectilinear figures, while the sphere 
<A NAME="348"></A>has eight pyramidal parts. The figures must have their principles, and, 
<A NAME="349"></A>whether these are one or two or more, the simple bodies must be the same 
<A NAME="350"></A>in number as they. Again, if every element has its proper movement, and 
<A NAME="351"></A>a simple body has a simple movement, and the number of simple movements 
<A NAME="352"></A>is not infinite, because the simple motions are only two and the number 
<A NAME="353"></A>of places is not infinite, on these grounds also we should have to deny 
<A NAME="354"></A>that the number of elements is infinite.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="355"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="356"></A><BR><BR>Since the number of the elements must be limited, it remains to 
<A NAME="357"></A>inquire whether there is more than one element. Some assume one only, which 
<A NAME="358"></A>is according to some water, to others air, to others fire, to others again 
<A NAME="359"></A>something finer than water and denser than air, an infinite body-so they 
<A NAME="360"></A>say-bracing all the heavens.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>Now those who decide for a single element, which is either water 
<A NAME="362"></A>or air or a body finer than water and denser than air, and proceed to generate 
<A NAME="363"></A>other things out of it by use of the attributes density and rarity, all 
<A NAME="364"></A>alike fail to observe the fact that they are depriving the element of its 
<A NAME="365"></A>priority. Generation out of the elements is, as they say, synthesis, and 
<A NAME="366"></A>generation into the elements is analysis, so that the body with the finer 
<A NAME="367"></A>parts must have priority in the order of nature. But they say that fire 
<A NAME="368"></A>is of all bodies the finest. Hence fire will be first in the natural order. 
<A NAME="369"></A>And whether the finest body is fire or not makes no difference; anyhow 
<A NAME="370"></A>it must be one of the other bodies that is primary and not that which is 
<A NAME="371"></A>intermediate. Again, density and rarity, as instruments of generation, 
<A NAME="372"></A>are equivalent to fineness and coarseness, since the fine is rare, and 
<A NAME="373"></A>coarse in their use means dense. But fineness and coarseness, again, are 
<A NAME="374"></A>equivalent to greatness and smallness, since a thing with small parts is 
<A NAME="375"></A>fine and a thing with large parts coarse. For that which spreads itself 
<A NAME="376"></A>out widely is fine, and a thing composed of small parts is so spread out. 
<A NAME="377"></A>In the end, then, they distinguish the various other substances from the 
<A NAME="378"></A>element by the greatness and smallness of their parts. This method of distinction 
<A NAME="379"></A>makes all judgement relative. There will be no absolute distinction between 
<A NAME="380"></A>fire, water, and air, but one and the same body will be relatively to this 
<A NAME="381"></A>fire, relatively to something else air. The same difficulty is involved 
<A NAME="382"></A>equally in the view elements and distinguishes them by their greatness 
<A NAME="383"></A>and smallness. The principle of distinction between bodies being quantity, 
<A NAME="384"></A>the various sizes will be in a definite ratio, and whatever bodies are 
<A NAME="385"></A>in this ratio to one another must be air, fire, earth, and water respectively. 
<A NAME="386"></A>For the ratios of smaller bodies may be repeated among greater 
<A NAME="387"></A>bodies.
<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR>Those who start from fire as the single element, while avoiding 
<A NAME="389"></A>this difficulty, involve themselves in many others. Some of them give fire 
<A NAME="390"></A>a particular shape, like those who make it a pyramid, and this on one of 
<A NAME="391"></A>two grounds. The reason given may be-more crudely-that the pyramid is the 
<A NAME="392"></A>most piercing of figures as fire is of bodies, or-more ingeniously-the 
<A NAME="393"></A>position may be supported by the following argument. As all bodies are 
<A NAME="394"></A>composed of that which has the finest parts, so all solid figures are composed 
<A NAME="395"></A>of pryamids: but the finest body is fire, while among figures the pyramid 
<A NAME="396"></A>is primary and has the smallest parts; and the primary body must have the 
<A NAME="397"></A>primary figure: therefore fire will be a pyramid. Others, again, express 
<A NAME="398"></A>no opinion on the subject of its figure, but simply regard it as the of 
<A NAME="399"></A>the finest parts, which in combination will form other bodies, as the fusing 
<A NAME="400"></A>of gold-dust produces solid gold. Both of these views involve the same 
<A NAME="401"></A>difficulties. For (1) if, on the one hand, they make the primary body an 
<A NAME="402"></A>atom, the view will be open to the objections already advanced against 
<A NAME="403"></A>the atomic theory. And further the theory is inconsistent with a regard 
<A NAME="404"></A>for the facts of nature. For if all bodies are quantitatively commensurable, 
<A NAME="405"></A>and the relative size of the various homoeomerous masses and of their several 
<A NAME="406"></A>elements are in the same ratio, so that the total mass of water, for instance, 
<A NAME="407"></A>is related to the total mass of air as the elements of each are to one 
<A NAME="408"></A>another, and so on, and if there is more air than water and, generally, 
<A NAME="409"></A>more of the finer body than of the coarser, obviously the element of water 
<A NAME="410"></A>will be smaller than that of air. But the lesser quantity is contained 
<A NAME="411"></A>in the greater. Therefore the air element is divisible. And the same could 
<A NAME="412"></A>be shown of fire and of all bodies whose parts are relatively fine. (2) 
<A NAME="413"></A>If, on the other hand, the primary body is divisible, then (a) those who 
<A NAME="414"></A>give fire a special shape will have to say that a part of fire is not fire, 
<A NAME="415"></A>because a pyramid is not composed of pyramids, and also that not every 
<A NAME="416"></A>body is either an element or composed of elements, since a part of fire 
<A NAME="417"></A>will be neither fire nor any other element. And (b) those whose ground 
<A NAME="418"></A>of distinction is size will have to recognize an element prior to the element, 
<A NAME="419"></A>a regress which continues infinitely, since every body is divisible and 
<A NAME="420"></A>that which has the smallest parts is the element. Further, they too will 
<A NAME="421"></A>have to say that the same body is relatively to this fire and relatively 
<A NAME="422"></A>to that air, to others again water and earth.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>The common error of all views which assume a single element is 
<A NAME="424"></A>that they allow only one natural movement, which is the same for every 
<A NAME="425"></A>body. For it is a matter of observation that a natural body possesses a 
<A NAME="426"></A>principle of movement. If then all bodies are one, all will have one movement. 
<A NAME="427"></A>With this motion the greater their quantity the more they will move, just 
<A NAME="428"></A>as fire, in proportion as its quantity is greater, moves faster with the 
<A NAME="429"></A>upward motion which belongs to it. But the fact is that increase of quantity 
<A NAME="430"></A>makes many things move the faster downward. For these reasons, then, as 
<A NAME="431"></A>well as from the distinction already established of a plurality of natural 
<A NAME="432"></A>movements, it is impossible that there should be only one element. But 
<A NAME="433"></A>if the elements are not an infinity and not reducible to one, they must 
<A NAME="434"></A>be several and finite in number.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="435"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>First we must inquire whether the elements are eternal or subject 
<A NAME="437"></A>to generation and destruction; for when this question has been answered 
<A NAME="438"></A>their number and character will be manifest. In the first place, they cannot 
<A NAME="439"></A>be eternal. It is a matter of observation that fire, water, and every simple 
<A NAME="440"></A>body undergo a process of analysis, which must either continue infinitely 
<A NAME="441"></A>or stop somewhere. (1) Suppose it infinite. Then the time occupied by the 
<A NAME="442"></A>process will be infinite, and also that occupied by the reverse process 
<A NAME="443"></A>of synthesis. For the processes of analysis and synthesis succeed one another 
<A NAME="444"></A>in the various parts. It will follow that there are two infinite times 
<A NAME="445"></A>which are mutually exclusive, the time occupied by the synthesis, which 
<A NAME="446"></A>is infinite, being preceded by the period of analysis. There are thus two 
<A NAME="447"></A>mutually exclusive infinites, which is impossible. (2) Suppose, on the 
<A NAME="448"></A>other hand, that the analysis stops somewhere. Then the body at which it 
<A NAME="449"></A>stops will be either atomic or, as Empedocles seems to have intended, a 
<A NAME="450"></A>divisible body which will yet never be divided. The foregoing arguments 
<A NAME="451"></A>show that it cannot be an atom; but neither can it be a divisible body 
<A NAME="452"></A>which analysis will never reach. For a smaller body is more easily destroyed 
<A NAME="453"></A>than a larger; and a destructive process which succeeds in destroying, 
<A NAME="454"></A>that is, in resolving into smaller bodies, a body of some size, cannot 
<A NAME="455"></A>reasonably be expected to fail with the smaller body. Now in fire we observe 
<A NAME="456"></A>a destruction of two kinds: it is destroyed by its contrary when it is 
<A NAME="457"></A>quenched, and by itself when it dies out. But the effect is produced by 
<A NAME="458"></A>a greater quantity upon a lesser, and the more quickly the smaller it is. 
<A NAME="459"></A>The elements of bodies must therefore be subject to destruction and 
<A NAME="460"></A>generation.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>Since they are generated, they must be generated either from something 
<A NAME="462"></A>incorporeal or from a body, and if from a body, either from one another 
<A NAME="463"></A>or from something else. The theory which generates them from something 
<A NAME="464"></A>incorporeal requires an extra-corporeal void. For everything that comes 
<A NAME="465"></A>to be comes to be in something, and that in which the generation takes 
<A NAME="466"></A>place must either be incorporeal or possess body; and if it has body, there 
<A NAME="467"></A>will be two bodies in the same place at the same time, viz. that which 
<A NAME="468"></A>is coming to be and that which was previously there, while if it is incorporeal, 
<A NAME="469"></A>there must be an extra-corporeal void. But we have already shown that this 
<A NAME="470"></A>is impossible. But, on the other hand, it is equally impossible that the 
<A NAME="471"></A>elements should be generated from some kind of body. That would involve 
<A NAME="472"></A>a body distinct from the elements and prior to them. But if this body possesses 
<A NAME="473"></A>weight or lightness, it will be one of the elements; and if it has no tendency 
<A NAME="474"></A>to movement, it will be an immovable or mathematical entity, and therefore 
<A NAME="475"></A>not in a place at all. A place in which a thing is at rest is a place in 
<A NAME="476"></A>which it might move, either by constraint, i.e. unnaturally, or in the 
<A NAME="477"></A>absence of constraint, i.e. naturally. If, then, it is in a place and somewhere, 
<A NAME="478"></A>it will be one of the elements; and if it is not in a place, nothing can 
<A NAME="479"></A>come from it, since that which comes into being and that out of which it 
<A NAME="480"></A>comes must needs be together. The elements therefore cannot be generated 
<A NAME="481"></A>from something incorporeal nor from a body which is not an element, and 
<A NAME="482"></A>the only remaining alternative is that they are generated from one 
<A NAME="483"></A>another.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="484"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="485"></A><BR><BR>We must, therefore, turn to the question, what is the manner of 
<A NAME="486"></A>their generation from one another? Is it as Empedocles and Democritus say, 
<A NAME="487"></A>or as those who resolve bodies into planes say, or is there yet another 
<A NAME="488"></A>possibility? (1) What the followers of Empedocles do, though without observing 
<A NAME="489"></A>it themselves, is to reduce the generation of elements out of one another 
<A NAME="490"></A>to an illusion. They make it a process of excretion from a body of what 
<A NAME="491"></A>was in it all the time-as though generation required a vessel rather than 
<A NAME="492"></A>a material-so that it involves no change of anything. And even if this 
<A NAME="493"></A>were accepted, there are other implications equally unsatisfactory. We 
<A NAME="494"></A>do not expect a mass of matter to be made heavier by compression. But they 
<A NAME="495"></A>will be bound to maintain this, if they say that water is a body present 
<A NAME="496"></A>in air and excreted from air, since air becomes heavier when it turns into 
<A NAME="497"></A>water. Again, when the mixed body is divided, they can show no reason why 
<A NAME="498"></A>one of the constituents must by itself take up more room than the body 
<A NAME="499"></A>did: but when water turns into air, the room occupied is increased. The 
<A NAME="500"></A>fact is that the finer body takes up more room, as is obvious in any case 
<A NAME="501"></A>of transformation. As the liquid is converted into vapour or air the vessel 
<A NAME="502"></A>which contains it is often burst because it does not contain room enough. 
<A NAME="503"></A>Now, if there is no void at all, and if, as those who take this view say, 
<A NAME="504"></A>there is no expansion of bodies, the impossibility of this is manifest: 
<A NAME="505"></A>and if there is void and expansion, there is no accounting for the fact 
<A NAME="506"></A>that the body which results from division cfpies of necessity a greater 
<A NAME="507"></A>space. It is inevitable, too, that generation of one out of another should 
<A NAME="508"></A>come to a stop, since a finite quantum cannot contain an infinity of finite 
<A NAME="509"></A>quanta. When earth produces water something is taken away from the earth, 
<A NAME="510"></A>for the process is one of excretion. The same thing happens again when 
<A NAME="511"></A>the residue produces water. But this can only go on for ever, if the finite 
<A NAME="512"></A>body contains an infinity, which is impossible. Therefore the generation 
<A NAME="513"></A>of elements out of one another will not always continue.
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR>(2) We have now explained that the mutual transformations of the 
<A NAME="515"></A>elements cannot take place by means of excretion. The remaining alternative 
<A NAME="516"></A>is that they should be generated by changing into one another. And this 
<A NAME="517"></A>in one of two ways, either by change of shape, as the same wax takes the 
<A NAME="518"></A>shape both of a sphere and of a cube, or, as some assert, by resolution 
<A NAME="519"></A>into planes. (a) Generation by change of shape would necessarily involve 
<A NAME="520"></A>the assertion of atomic bodies. For if the particles were divisible there 
<A NAME="521"></A>would be a part of fire which was not fire and a part of earth which was 
<A NAME="522"></A>not earth, for the reason that not every part of a pyramid is a pyramid 
<A NAME="523"></A>nor of a cube a cube. But if (b) the process is resolution into planes, 
<A NAME="524"></A>the first difficulty is that the elements cannot all be generated out of 
<A NAME="525"></A>one another. This they are obliged to assert, and do assert. It is absurd, 
<A NAME="526"></A>because it is unreasonable that one element alone should have no part in 
<A NAME="527"></A>the transformations, and also contrary to the observed data of sense, according 
<A NAME="528"></A>to which all alike change into one another. In fact their explanation of 
<A NAME="529"></A>the observations is not consistent with the observations. And the reason 
<A NAME="530"></A>is that their ultimate principles are wrongly assumed: they had certain 
<A NAME="531"></A>predetermined views, and were resolved to bring everything into line with 
<A NAME="532"></A>them. It seems that perceptible things require perceptible principles, 
<A NAME="533"></A>eternal things eternal principles, corruptible things corruptible principles; 
<A NAME="534"></A>and, in general, every subject matter principles homogeneous with itself. 
<A NAME="535"></A>But they, owing to their love for their principles, fall into the attitude 
<A NAME="536"></A>of men who undertake the defence of a position in argument. In the confidence 
<A NAME="537"></A>that the principles are true they are ready to accept any consequence of 
<A NAME="538"></A>their application. As though some principles did not require to be judged 
<A NAME="539"></A>from their results, and particularly from their final issue! And that issue, 
<A NAME="540"></A>which in the case of productive knowledge is the product, in the knowledge 
<A NAME="541"></A>of nature is the unimpeachable evidence of the senses as to each 
<A NAME="542"></A>fact.
<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR>The result of their view is that earth has the best right to the 
<A NAME="544"></A>name element, and is alone indestructible; for that which is indissoluble 
<A NAME="545"></A>is indestructible and elementary, and earth alone cannot be dissolved into 
<A NAME="546"></A>any body but itself. Again, in the case of those elements which do suffer 
<A NAME="547"></A>dissolution, the 'suspension' of the triangles is unsatisfactory. But this 
<A NAME="548"></A>takes place whenever one is dissolved into another, because of the numerical 
<A NAME="549"></A>inequality of the triangles which compose them. Further, those who hold 
<A NAME="550"></A>these views must needs suppose that generation does not start from a body. 
<A NAME="551"></A>For what is generated out of planes cannot be said to have been generated 
<A NAME="552"></A>from a body. And they must also assert that not all bodies are divisible, 
<A NAME="553"></A>coming thus into conflict with our most accurate sciences, namely the mathematical, 
<A NAME="554"></A>which assume that even the intelligible is divisible, while they, in their 
<A NAME="555"></A>anxiety to save their hypothesis, cannot even admit this of every perceptible 
<A NAME="556"></A>thing. For any one who gives each element a shape of its own, and makes 
<A NAME="557"></A>this the ground of distinction between the substances, has to attribute 
<A NAME="558"></A>to them indivisibility; since division of a pyramid or a sphere must leave 
<A NAME="559"></A>somewhere at least a residue which is not sphere or a pyramid. Either, 
<A NAME="560"></A>then, a part of fire is not fire, so that there is a body prior to the 
<A NAME="561"></A>element-for every body is either an element or composed of elements-or 
<A NAME="562"></A>not every body is divisible.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="563"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>In general, the attempt to give a shape to each of the simple bodies 
<A NAME="565"></A>is unsound, for the reason, first, that they will not succeed in filling 
<A NAME="566"></A>the whole. It is agreed that there are only three plane figures which can 
<A NAME="567"></A>fill a space, the triangle, the square, and the hexagon, and only two solids, 
<A NAME="568"></A>the pyramid and the cube. But the theory needs more than these because 
<A NAME="569"></A>the elements which it recognizes are more in number. Secondly, it is manifest 
<A NAME="570"></A>that the simple bodies are often given a shape by the place in which they 
<A NAME="571"></A>are included, particularly water and air. In such a case the shape of the 
<A NAME="572"></A>element cannot persist; for, if it did, the contained mass would not be 
<A NAME="573"></A>in continuous contact with the containing body; while, if its shape is 
<A NAME="574"></A>changed, it will cease to be water, since the distinctive quality is shape. 
<A NAME="575"></A>Clearly, then, their shapes are not fixed. Indeed, nature itself seems 
<A NAME="576"></A>to offer corroboration of this theoretical conclusion. Just as in other 
<A NAME="577"></A>cases the substratum must be formless and unshapen-for thus the 'all-receptive', 
<A NAME="578"></A>as we read in the Timaeus, will be best for modelling-so the elements should 
<A NAME="579"></A>be conceived as a material for composite things; and that is why they can 
<A NAME="580"></A>put off their qualitative distinctions and pass into one another. Further, 
<A NAME="581"></A>how can they account for the generation of flesh and bone or any other 
<A NAME="582"></A>continuous body? The elements alone cannot produce them because their collocation 
<A NAME="583"></A>cannot produce a continuum. Nor can the composition of planes; for this 
<A NAME="584"></A>produces the elements themselves, not bodies made up of them. Any one then 
<A NAME="585"></A>who insists upon an exact statement of this kind of theory, instead of 
<A NAME="586"></A>assenting after a passing glance at it, will see that it removes generation 
<A NAME="587"></A>from the world.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR>Further, the very properties, powers, and motions, to which they 
<A NAME="589"></A>paid particular attention in allotting shapes, show the shapes not to be 
<A NAME="590"></A>in accord with the bodies. Because fire is mobile and productive of heat 
<A NAME="591"></A>and combustion, some made it a sphere, others a pyramid. These shapes, 
<A NAME="592"></A>they thought, were the most mobile because they offer the fewest points 
<A NAME="593"></A>of contact and are the least stable of any; they were also the most apt 
<A NAME="594"></A>to produce warmth and combustion, because the one is angular throughout 
<A NAME="595"></A>while the other has the most acute angles, and the angles, they say, produce 
<A NAME="596"></A>warmth and combustion. Now, in the first place, with regard to movement 
<A NAME="597"></A>both are in error. These may be the figures best adapted to movement; they 
<A NAME="598"></A>are not, however, well adapted to the movement of fire, which is an upward 
<A NAME="599"></A>and rectilinear movement, but rather to that form of circular movement 
<A NAME="600"></A>which we call rolling. Earth, again, they call a cube because it is stable 
<A NAME="601"></A>and at rest. But it rests only in its own place, not anywhere; from any 
<A NAME="602"></A>other it moves if nothing hinders, and fire and the other bodies do the 
<A NAME="603"></A>same. The obvious inference, therefore, is that fire and each several element 
<A NAME="604"></A>is in a foreign place a sphere or a pyramid, but in its own a cube. Again, 
<A NAME="605"></A>if the possession of angles makes a body produce heat and combustion, every 
<A NAME="606"></A>element produces heat, though one may do so more than another. For they 
<A NAME="607"></A>all possess angles, the octahedron and dodecahedron as well as the pyramid; 
<A NAME="608"></A>and Democritus makes even the sphere a kind of angle, which cuts things 
<A NAME="609"></A>because of its mobility. The difference, then, will be one of degree: and 
<A NAME="610"></A>this is plainly false. They must also accept the inference that the mathematical 
<A NAME="611"></A>produce heat and combustion, since they too possess angles and contain 
<A NAME="612"></A>atomic spheres and pyramids, especially if there are, as they allege, atomic 
<A NAME="613"></A>figures. Anyhow if these functions belong to some of these things and not 
<A NAME="614"></A>to others, they should explain the difference, instead of speaking in quite 
<A NAME="615"></A>general terms as they do. Again, combustion of a body produces fire, and 
<A NAME="616"></A>fire is a sphere or a pyramid. The body, then, is turned into spheres or 
<A NAME="617"></A>pyramids. Let us grant that these figures may reasonably be supposed to 
<A NAME="618"></A>cut and break up bodies as fire does; still it remains quite inexplicable 
<A NAME="619"></A>that a pyramid must needs produce pyramids or a sphere spheres. One might 
<A NAME="620"></A>as well postulate that a knife or a saw divides things into knives or saws. 
<A NAME="621"></A>It is also ridiculous to think only of division when allotting fire its 
<A NAME="622"></A>shape. Fire is generally thought of as combining and connecting rather 
<A NAME="623"></A>than as separating. For though it separates bodies different in kind, it 
<A NAME="624"></A>combines those which are the same; and the combining is essential to it, 
<A NAME="625"></A>the functions of connecting and uniting being a mark of fire, while the 
<A NAME="626"></A>separating is incidental. For the expulsion of the foreign body is an incident 
<A NAME="627"></A>in the compacting of the homogeneous. In choosing the shape, then, they 
<A NAME="628"></A>should have thought either of both functions or preferably of the combining 
<A NAME="629"></A>function. In addition, since hot and cold are contrary powers, it is impossible 
<A NAME="630"></A>to allot any shape to the cold. For the shape given must be the contrary 
<A NAME="631"></A>of that given to the hot, but there is no contrariety between figures. 
<A NAME="632"></A>That is why they have all left the cold out, though properly either all 
<A NAME="633"></A>or none should have their distinguishing figures. Some of them, however, 
<A NAME="634"></A>do attempt to explain this power, and they contradict themselves. A body 
<A NAME="635"></A>of large particles, they say, is cold because instead of penetrating through 
<A NAME="636"></A>the passages it crushes. Clearly, then, that which is hot is that which 
<A NAME="637"></A>penetrates these passages, or in other words that which has fine particles. 
<A NAME="638"></A>It results that hot and cold are distinguished not by the figure but by 
<A NAME="639"></A>the size of the particles. Again, if the pyramids are unequal in size, 
<A NAME="640"></A>the large ones will not be fire, and that figure will produce not combustion 
<A NAME="641"></A>but its contrary.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR><BR>From what has been said it is clear that the difference of the 
<A NAME="643"></A>elements does not depend upon their shape. Now their most important differences 
<A NAME="644"></A>are those of property, function, and power; for every natural body has, 
<A NAME="645"></A>we maintain, its own functions, properties, and powers. Our first business, 
<A NAME="646"></A>then, will be to speak of these, and that inquiry will enable us to explain 
<A NAME="647"></A>the differences of each from each.
