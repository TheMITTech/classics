<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>In making a speech one must study three points: first, the means of producing 
<A NAME="12"></A>persuasion; second, the style, or language, to be used; third, the proper 
<A NAME="13"></A>arrangement of the various parts of the speech. We have already specified 
<A NAME="14"></A>the sources of persuasion. We have shown that these are three in number; 
<A NAME="15"></A>what they are; and why there are only these three: for we have shown that 
<A NAME="16"></A>persuasion must in every case be effected either (1) by working on the 
<A NAME="17"></A>emotions of the judges themselves, (2) by giving them the right impression 
<A NAME="18"></A>of the speakers' character, or (3) by proving the truth of the statements 
<A NAME="19"></A>made.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>Enthymemes also have been described, and the sources from which 
<A NAME="21"></A>they should be derived; there being both special and general lines of argument 
<A NAME="22"></A>for enthymemes.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR>Our next subject will be the style of expression. For it is not 
<A NAME="24"></A>enough to know what we ought to say; we must also say it as we ought; much 
<A NAME="25"></A>help is thus afforded towards producing the right impression of a speech. 
<A NAME="26"></A>The first question to receive attention was naturally the one that comes 
<A NAME="27"></A>first naturally-how persuasion can be produced from the facts themselves. 
<A NAME="28"></A>The second is how to set these facts out in language. A third would be 
<A NAME="29"></A>the proper method of delivery; this is a thing that affects the success 
<A NAME="30"></A>of a speech greatly; but hitherto the subject has been neglected. Indeed, 
<A NAME="31"></A>it was long before it found a way into the arts of tragic drama and epic 
<A NAME="32"></A>recitation: at first poets acted their tragedies themselves. It is plain 
<A NAME="33"></A>that delivery has just as much to do with oratory as with poetry. (In connexion 
<A NAME="34"></A>with poetry, it has been studied by Glaucon of Teos among others.) It is, 
<A NAME="35"></A>essentially, a matter of the right management of the voice to express the 
<A NAME="36"></A>various emotions-of speaking loudly, softly, or between the two; of high, 
<A NAME="37"></A>low, or intermediate pitch; of the various rhythms that suit various subjects. 
<A NAME="38"></A>These are the three things-volume of sound, modulation of pitch, and rhythm-that 
<A NAME="39"></A>a speaker bears in mind. It is those who do bear them in mind who usually 
<A NAME="40"></A>win prizes in the dramatic contests; and just as in drama the actors now 
<A NAME="41"></A>count for more than the poets, so it is in the contests of public life, 
<A NAME="42"></A>owing to the defects of our political institutions. No systematic treatise 
<A NAME="43"></A>upon the rules of delivery has yet been composed; indeed, even the study 
<A NAME="44"></A>of language made no progress till late in the day. Besides, delivery is-very 
<A NAME="45"></A>properly-not regarded as an elevated subject of inquiry. Still, the whole 
<A NAME="46"></A>business of rhetoric being concerned with appearances, we must pay attention 
<A NAME="47"></A>to the subject of delivery, unworthy though it is, because we cannot do 
<A NAME="48"></A>without it. The right thing in speaking really is that we should be satisfied 
<A NAME="49"></A>not to annoy our hearers, without trying to delight them: we ought in fairness 
<A NAME="50"></A>to fight our case with no help beyond the bare facts: nothing, therefore, 
<A NAME="51"></A>should matter except the proof of those facts. Still, as has been already 
<A NAME="52"></A>said, other things affect the result considerably, owing to the defects 
<A NAME="53"></A>of our hearers. The arts of language cannot help having a small but real 
<A NAME="54"></A>importance, whatever it is we have to expound to others: the way in which 
<A NAME="55"></A>a thing is said does affect its intelligibility. Not, however, so much 
<A NAME="56"></A>importance as people think. All such arts are fanciful and meant to charm 
<A NAME="57"></A>the hearer. Nobody uses fine language when teaching 
<A NAME="58"></A>geometry.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>When the principles of delivery have been worked out, they will 
<A NAME="60"></A>produce the same effect as on the stage. But only very slight attempts 
<A NAME="61"></A>to deal with them have been made and by a few people, as by Thrasymachus 
<A NAME="62"></A>in his 'Appeals to Pity'. Dramatic ability is a natural gift, and can hardly 
<A NAME="63"></A>be systematically taught. The principles of good diction can be so taught, 
<A NAME="64"></A>and therefore we have men of ability in this direction too, who win prizes 
<A NAME="65"></A>in their turn, as well as those speakers who excel in delivery-speeches 
<A NAME="66"></A>of the written or literary kind owe more of their effect to their direction 
<A NAME="67"></A>than to their thought.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>It was naturally the poets who first set the movement going; for 
<A NAME="69"></A>words represent things, and they had also the human voice at their disposal, 
<A NAME="70"></A>which of all our organs can best represent other things. Thus the arts 
<A NAME="71"></A>of recitation and acting were formed, and others as well. Now it was because 
<A NAME="72"></A>poets seemed to win fame through their fine language when their thoughts 
<A NAME="73"></A>were simple enough, that the language of oratorical prose at first took 
<A NAME="74"></A>a poetical colour, e.g. that of Gorgias. Even now most uneducated people 
<A NAME="75"></A>think that poetical language makes the finest discourses. That is not true: 
<A NAME="76"></A>the language of prose is distinct from that of poetry. This is shown by 
<A NAME="77"></A>the state of things to-day, when even the language of tragedy has altered 
<A NAME="78"></A>its character. Just as iambics were adopted, instead of tetrameters, because 
<A NAME="79"></A>they are the most prose-like of all metres, so tragedy has given up all 
<A NAME="80"></A>those words, not used in ordinary talk, which decorated the early drama 
<A NAME="81"></A>and are still used by the writers of hexameter poems. It is therefore ridiculous 
<A NAME="82"></A>to imitate a poetical manner which the poets themselves have dropped; and 
<A NAME="83"></A>it is now plain that we have not to treat in detail the whole question 
<A NAME="84"></A>of style, but may confine ourselves to that part of it which concerns our 
<A NAME="85"></A>present subject, rhetoric. The other--the poetical--part of it has been 
<A NAME="86"></A>discussed in the treatise on the Art of Poetry.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="87"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>We may, then, start from the observations there made, including 
<A NAME="89"></A>the definition of style. Style to be good must be clear, as is proved by 
<A NAME="90"></A>the fact that speech which fails to convey a plain meaning will fail to 
<A NAME="91"></A>do just what speech has to do. It must also be appropriate, avoiding both 
<A NAME="92"></A>meanness and undue elevation; poetical language is certainly free from 
<A NAME="93"></A>meanness, but it is not appropriate to prose. Clearness is secured by using 
<A NAME="94"></A>the words (nouns and verbs alike) that are current and ordinary. Freedom 
<A NAME="95"></A>from meanness, and positive adornment too, are secured by using the other 
<A NAME="96"></A>words mentioned in the Art of Poetry. Such variation from what is usual 
<A NAME="97"></A>makes the language appear more stately. People do not feel towards strangers 
<A NAME="98"></A>as they do towards their own countrymen, and the same thing is true of 
<A NAME="99"></A>their feeling for language. It is therefore well to give to everyday speech 
<A NAME="100"></A>an unfamiliar air: people like what strikes them, and are struck by what 
<A NAME="101"></A>is out of the way. In verse such effects are common, and there they are 
<A NAME="102"></A>fitting: the persons and things there spoken of are comparatively remote 
<A NAME="103"></A>from ordinary life. In prose passages they are far less often fitting because 
<A NAME="104"></A>the subject-matter is less exalted. Even in poetry, it is not quite appropriate 
<A NAME="105"></A>that fine language should be used by a slave or a very young man, or about 
<A NAME="106"></A>very trivial subjects: even in poetry the style, to be appropriate, must 
<A NAME="107"></A>sometimes be toned down, though at other times heightened. We can now see 
<A NAME="108"></A>that a writer must disguise his art and give the impression of speaking 
<A NAME="109"></A>naturally and not artificially. Naturalness is persuasive, artificiality 
<A NAME="110"></A>is the contrary; for our hearers are prejudiced and think we have some 
<A NAME="111"></A>design against them, as if we were mixing their wines for them. It is like 
<A NAME="112"></A>the difference between the quality of Theodorus' voice and the voices of 
<A NAME="113"></A>all other actors: his really seems to be that of the character who is speaking, 
<A NAME="114"></A>theirs do not. We can hide our purpose successfully by taking the single 
<A NAME="115"></A>words of our composition from the speech of ordinary life. This is done 
<A NAME="116"></A>in poetry by Euripides, who was the first to show the way to his 
<A NAME="117"></A>successors.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>Language is composed of nouns and verbs. Nouns are of the various 
<A NAME="119"></A>kinds considered in the treatise on Poetry. Strange words, compound words, 
<A NAME="120"></A>and invented words must be used sparingly and on few occasions: on what 
<A NAME="121"></A>occasions we shall state later. The reason for this restriction has been 
<A NAME="122"></A>already indicated: they depart from what is suitable, in the direction 
<A NAME="123"></A>of excess. In the language of prose, besides the regular and proper terms 
<A NAME="124"></A>for things, metaphorical terms only can be used with advantage. This we 
<A NAME="125"></A>gather from the fact that these two classes of terms, the proper or regular 
<A NAME="126"></A>and the metaphorical-these and no others-are used by everybody in conversation. 
<A NAME="127"></A>We can now see that a good writer can produce a style that is distinguished 
<A NAME="128"></A>without being obtrusive, and is at the same time clear, thus satisfying 
<A NAME="129"></A>our definition of good oratorical prose. Words of ambiguous meaning are 
<A NAME="130"></A>chiefly useful to enable the sophist to mislead his hearers. Synonyms are 
<A NAME="131"></A>useful to the poet, by which I mean words whose ordinary meaning is the 
<A NAME="132"></A>same, e.g. 'porheueseai' (advancing) and 'badizein' (proceeding); these 
<A NAME="133"></A>two are ordinary words and have the same meaning.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>In the Art of Poetry, as we have already said, will be found definitions 
<A NAME="135"></A>of these kinds of words; a classification of Metaphors; and mention of 
<A NAME="136"></A>the fact that metaphor is of great value both in poetry and in prose. Prose-writers 
<A NAME="137"></A>must, however, pay specially careful attention to metaphor, because their 
<A NAME="138"></A>other resources are scantier than those of poets. Metaphor, moreover, gives 
<A NAME="139"></A>style clearness, charm, and distinction as nothing else can: and it is 
<A NAME="140"></A>not a thing whose use can be taught by one man to another. Metaphors, like 
<A NAME="141"></A>epithets, must be fitting, which means that they must fairly correspond 
<A NAME="142"></A>to the thing signified: failing this, their inappropriateness will be conspicuous: 
<A NAME="143"></A>the want of harmony between two things is emphasized by their being placed 
<A NAME="144"></A>side by side. It is like having to ask ourselves what dress will suit an 
<A NAME="145"></A>old man; certainly not the crimson cloak that suits a young man. And if 
<A NAME="146"></A>you wish to pay a compliment, you must take your metaphor from something 
<A NAME="147"></A>better in the same line; if to disparage, from something worse. To illustrate 
<A NAME="148"></A>my meaning: since opposites are in the same class, you do what I have suggested 
<A NAME="149"></A>if you say that a man who begs 'prays', and a man who prays 'begs'; for 
<A NAME="150"></A>praying and begging are both varieties of asking. So Iphicrates called 
<A NAME="151"></A>Callias a 'mendicant priest' instead of a 'torch-bearer', and Callias replied 
<A NAME="152"></A>that Iphicrates must be uninitiated or he would have called him not a 'mendicant 
<A NAME="153"></A>priest' but a 'torch-bearer'. Both are religious titles, but one is honourable 
<A NAME="154"></A>and the other is not. Again, somebody calls actors 'hangers-on of Dionysus', 
<A NAME="155"></A>but they call themselves 'artists': each of these terms is a metaphor, 
<A NAME="156"></A>the one intended to throw dirt at the actor, the other to dignify him. 
<A NAME="157"></A>And pirates now call themselves 'purveyors'. We can thus call a crime a 
<A NAME="158"></A>mistake, or a mistake a crime. We can say that a thief 'took' a thing, 
<A NAME="159"></A>or that he 'plundered' his victim. An expression like that of Euripides' 
<A NAME="160"></A>Telephus, <BR><BR>"King of the oar, on Mysia's coast he landed, 
<A NAME="161"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="162"></A>is inappropriate; the word 'king' goes beyond the dignity of the subject, 
<A NAME="163"></A>and so the art is not concealed. A metaphor may be amiss because the very 
<A NAME="164"></A>syllables of the words conveying it fail to indicate sweetness of vocal 
<A NAME="165"></A>utterance. Thus Dionysius the Brazen in his elegies calls poetry 'Calliope's 
<A NAME="166"></A>screech'. Poetry and screeching are both, to be sure, vocal utterances. 
<A NAME="167"></A>But the metaphor is bad, because the sounds of 'screeching', unlike those 
<A NAME="168"></A>of poetry, are discordant and unmeaning. Further, in using metaphors to 
<A NAME="169"></A>give names to nameless things, we must draw them not from remote but from 
<A NAME="170"></A>kindred and similar things, so that the kinship is clearly perceived as 
<A NAME="171"></A>soon as the words are said. Thus in the celebrated riddle <BR><BR>"I marked 
<A NAME="172"></A>how a man glued bronze with fire to another man's body, 
<A NAME="173"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="174"></A>the process is nameless; but both it and gluing are a kind of application, 
<A NAME="175"></A>and that is why the application of the cupping-glass is here called a 'gluing'. 
<A NAME="176"></A>Good riddles do, in general, provide us with satisfactory metaphors: for 
<A NAME="177"></A>metaphors imply riddles, and therefore a good riddle can furnish a good 
<A NAME="178"></A>metaphor. Further, the materials of metaphors must be beautiful; and the 
<A NAME="179"></A>beauty, like the ugliness, of all words may, as Licymnius says, lie in 
<A NAME="180"></A>their sound or in their meaning. Further, there is a third consideration-one 
<A NAME="181"></A>that upsets the fallacious argument of the sophist Bryson, that there is 
<A NAME="182"></A>no such thing as foul language, because in whatever words you put a given 
<A NAME="183"></A>thing your meaning is the same. This is untrue. One term may describe a 
<A NAME="184"></A>thing more truly than another, may be more like it, and set it more intimately 
<A NAME="185"></A>before our eyes. Besides, two different words will represent a thing in 
<A NAME="186"></A>two different lights; so on this ground also one term must be held fairer 
<A NAME="187"></A>or fouler than another. For both of two terms will indicate what is fair, 
<A NAME="188"></A>or what is foul, but not simply their fairness or their foulness, or if 
<A NAME="189"></A>so, at any rate not in an equal degree. The materials of metaphor must 
<A NAME="190"></A>be beautiful to the ear, to the understanding, to the eye or some other 
<A NAME="191"></A>physical sense. It is better, for instance, to say 'rosy-fingered morn', 
<A NAME="192"></A>than 'crimson-fingered' or, worse still, 'red-fingered morn'. The epithets 
<A NAME="193"></A>that we apply, too, may have a bad and ugly aspect, as when Orestes is 
<A NAME="194"></A>called a 'mother-slayer'; or a better one, as when he is called his 'father's 
<A NAME="195"></A>avenger'. Simonides, when the victor in the mule-race offered him a small 
<A NAME="196"></A>fee, refused to write him an ode, because, he said, it was so unpleasant 
<A NAME="197"></A>to write odes to half-asses: but on receiving an adequate fee, he wrote 
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>"Hail to you, daughters of storm-footed steeds? 
<A NAME="199"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="200"></A>though of course they were daughters of asses too. The same effect is attained 
<A NAME="201"></A>by the use of diminutives, which make a bad thing less bad and a good thing 
<A NAME="202"></A>less good. Take, for instance, the banter of Aristophanes in the Babylonians 
<A NAME="203"></A>where he uses 'goldlet' for 'gold', 'cloaklet' for 'cloak', 'scoffiet' 
<A NAME="204"></A>for 'scoff, and 'plaguelet'. But alike in using epithets and in using diminutives 
<A NAME="205"></A>we must be wary and must observe the mean.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="206"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>Bad taste in language may take any of four forms:
<A NAME="208"></A><BR>(1) The misuse of compound words. Lycophron, for instance, talks of 
<A NAME="209"></A>the 'many visaged heaven' above the 'giant-crested earth', and again the 
<A NAME="210"></A>'strait-pathed shore'; and Gorgias of the 'pauper-poet flatterer' and 'oath-breaking 
<A NAME="211"></A>and over-oath-keeping'. Alcidamas uses such expressions as 'the soul filling 
<A NAME="212"></A>with rage and face becoming flame-flushed', and 'he thought their enthusiasm 
<A NAME="213"></A>would be issue-fraught' and 'issue-fraught he made the persuasion of his 
<A NAME="214"></A>words', and 'sombre-hued is the floor of the sea'.The way all these words 
<A NAME="215"></A>are compounded makes them, we feel, fit for verse only. This, then, is 
<A NAME="216"></A>one form in which bad taste is shown.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>(2) Another is the employment of strange words. For instance, Lycophron 
<A NAME="218"></A>talks of 'the prodigious Xerxes' and 'spoliative Sciron'; Alcidamas of 
<A NAME="219"></A>'a toy for poetry' and 'the witlessness of nature', and says 'whetted with 
<A NAME="220"></A>the unmitigated temper of his spirit'.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>(3) A third form is the use of long, unseasonable, or frequent 
<A NAME="222"></A>epithets. It is appropriate enough for a poet to talk of 'white milk', 
<A NAME="223"></A>in prose such epithets are sometimes lacking in appropriateness or, when 
<A NAME="224"></A>spread too thickly, plainly reveal the author turning his prose into poetry. 
<A NAME="225"></A>Of course we must use some epithets, since they lift our style above the 
<A NAME="226"></A>usual level and give it an air of distinction. But we must aim at the due 
<A NAME="227"></A>mean, or the result will be worse than if we took no trouble at all; we 
<A NAME="228"></A>shall get something actually bad instead of something merely not good. 
<A NAME="229"></A>That is why the epithets of Alcidamas seem so tasteless; he does not use 
<A NAME="230"></A>them as the seasoning of the meat, but as the meat itself, so numerous 
<A NAME="231"></A>and swollen and aggressive are they. For instance, he does not say 'sweat', 
<A NAME="232"></A>but 'the moist sweat'; not 'to the Isthmian games', but 'to the world-concourse 
<A NAME="233"></A>of the Isthmian games'; not 'laws', but 'the laws that are monarchs of 
<A NAME="234"></A>states'; not 'at a run', but 'his heart impelling him to speed of foot'; 
<A NAME="235"></A>not 'a school of the Muses', but 'Nature's school of the Muses had he inherited'; 
<A NAME="236"></A>and so 'frowning care of heart', and 'achiever' not of 'popularity' but 
<A NAME="237"></A>of 'universal popularity', and 'dispenser of pleasure to his audience', 
<A NAME="238"></A>and 'he concealed it' not 'with boughs' but 'with boughs of the forest 
<A NAME="239"></A>trees', and 'he clothed' not 'his body' but 'his body's nakedness', and 
<A NAME="240"></A>'his soul's desire was counter imitative' (this's at one and the same time 
<A NAME="241"></A>a compound and an epithet, so that it seems a poet's effort), and 'so extravagant 
<A NAME="242"></A>the excess of his wickedness'. We thus see how the inappropriateness of 
<A NAME="243"></A>such poetical language imports absurdity and tastelessness into speeches, 
<A NAME="244"></A>as well as the obscurity that comes from all this verbosity-for when the 
<A NAME="245"></A>sense is plain, you only obscure and spoil its clearness by piling up 
<A NAME="246"></A>words.
<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>The ordinary use of compound words is where there is no term for 
<A NAME="248"></A>a thing and some compound can be easily formed, like 'pastime' (chronotribein); 
<A NAME="249"></A>but if this is much done, the prose character disappears entirely. We now 
<A NAME="250"></A>see why the language of compounds is just the thing for writers of dithyrambs, 
<A NAME="251"></A>who love sonorous noises; strange words for writers of epic poetry, which 
<A NAME="252"></A>is a proud and stately affair; and metaphor for iambic verse, the metre 
<A NAME="253"></A>which (as has been already' said) is widely used to-day.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>(4) There remains the fourth region in which bad taste may be shown, 
<A NAME="255"></A>metaphor. Metaphors like other things may be inappropriate. Some are so 
<A NAME="256"></A>because they are ridiculous; they are indeed used by comic as well as tragic 
<A NAME="257"></A>poets. Others are too grand and theatrical; and these, if they are far-fetched, 
<A NAME="258"></A>may also be obscure. For instance, Gorgias talks of 'events that are green 
<A NAME="259"></A>and full of sap', and says 'foul was the deed you sowed and evil the harvest 
<A NAME="260"></A>you reaped'. That is too much like poetry. Alcidamas, again, called philosophy 
<A NAME="261"></A>'a fortress that threatens the power of law', and the Odyssey 'a goodly 
<A NAME="262"></A>looking-glass of human life',' talked about 'offering no such toy to poetry': 
<A NAME="263"></A>all these expressions fail, for the reasons given, to carry the hearer 
<A NAME="264"></A>with them. The address of Gorgias to the swallow, when she had let her 
<A NAME="265"></A>droppings fall on him as she flew overhead, is in the best tragic manner. 
<A NAME="266"></A>He said, 'Nay, shame, O Philomela'. Considering her as a bird, you could 
<A NAME="267"></A>not call her act shameful; considering her as a girl, you could; and so 
<A NAME="268"></A>it was a good gibe to address her as what she was once and not as what 
<A NAME="269"></A>she is.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="270"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>The Simile also is a metaphor; the difference is but slight. When 
<A NAME="272"></A>the poet says of Achilles that he <BR><BR>"Leapt on the foe as a lion, 
<A NAME="273"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="274"></A>this is a simile; when he says of him 'the lion leapt', it is a metaphor-here, 
<A NAME="275"></A>since both are courageous, he has transferred to Achilles the name of 'lion'. 
<A NAME="276"></A>Similes are useful in prose as well as in verse; but not often, since they 
<A NAME="277"></A>are of the nature of poetry. They are to be employed just as metaphors 
<A NAME="278"></A>are employed, since they are really the same thing except for the difference 
<A NAME="279"></A>mentioned.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>The following are examples of similes. Androtion said of Idrieus 
<A NAME="281"></A>that he was like a terrier let off the chain, that flies at you and bites 
<A NAME="282"></A>you-Idrieus too was savage now that he was let out of his chains. Theodamas 
<A NAME="283"></A>compared Archidamus to an Euxenus who could not do geometry-a proportional 
<A NAME="284"></A>simile, implying that Euxenus is an Archidamus who can do geometry. In 
<A NAME="285"></A>Plato's Republic those who strip the dead are compared to curs which bite 
<A NAME="286"></A>the stones thrown at them but do not touch the thrower, and there is the 
<A NAME="287"></A>simile about the Athenian people, who are compared to a ship's captain 
<A NAME="288"></A>who is strong but a little deaf; and the one about poets' verses, which 
<A NAME="289"></A>are likened to persons who lack beauty but possess youthful freshness-when 
<A NAME="290"></A>the freshness has faded the charm perishes, and so with verses when broken 
<A NAME="291"></A>up into prose. Pericles compared the Samians to children who take their 
<A NAME="292"></A>pap but go on crying; and the Boeotians to holm-oaks, because they were 
<A NAME="293"></A>ruining one another by civil wars just as one oak causes another oak's 
<A NAME="294"></A>fall. Demosthenes said that the Athenian people were like sea-sick men 
<A NAME="295"></A>on board ship. Again, Demosthenes compared the political orators to nurses 
<A NAME="296"></A>who swallow the bit of food themselves and then smear the children's lips 
<A NAME="297"></A>with the spittle. Antisthenes compared the lean Cephisodotus to frankincense, 
<A NAME="298"></A>because it was his consumption that gave one pleasure. All these ideas 
<A NAME="299"></A>may be expressed either as similes or as metaphors; those which succeed 
<A NAME="300"></A>as metaphors will obviously do well also as similes, and similes, with 
<A NAME="301"></A>the explanation omitted, will appear as metaphors. But the proportional 
<A NAME="302"></A>metaphor must always apply reciprocally to either of its co-ordinate terms. 
<A NAME="303"></A>For instance, if a drinking-bowl is the shield of Dionysus, a shield may 
<A NAME="304"></A>fittingly be called the drinking-bowl of Ares.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="305"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>Such, then, are the ingredients of which speech is composed. The 
<A NAME="307"></A>foundation of good style is correctness of language, which falls under 
<A NAME="308"></A>five heads. (1) First, the proper use of connecting words, and the arrangement 
<A NAME="309"></A>of them in the natural sequence which some of them require. For instance, 
<A NAME="310"></A>the connective 'men' (e.g. ego men) requires the correlative de (e.g. o 
<A NAME="311"></A>de). The answering word must be brought in before the first has been forgotten, 
<A NAME="312"></A>and not be widely separated from it; nor, except in the few cases where 
<A NAME="313"></A>this is appropriate, is another connective to be introduced before the 
<A NAME="314"></A>one required. Consider the sentence, 'But as soon as he told me (for Cleon 
<A NAME="315"></A>had come begging and praying), took them along and set out.' In this sentence 
<A NAME="316"></A>many connecting words are inserted in front of the one required to complete 
<A NAME="317"></A>the sense; and if there is a long interval before 'set out', the result 
<A NAME="318"></A>is obscurity. One merit, then, of good style lies in the right use of connecting 
<A NAME="319"></A>words. (2) The second lies in calling things by their own special names 
<A NAME="320"></A>and not by vague general ones. (3) The third is to avoid ambiguities; unless, 
<A NAME="321"></A>indeed, you definitely desire to be ambiguous, as those do who have nothing 
<A NAME="322"></A>to say but are pretending to mean something. Such people are apt to put 
<A NAME="323"></A>that sort of thing into verse. Empedocles, for instance, by his long circumlocutions 
<A NAME="324"></A>imposes on his hearers; these are affected in the same way as most people 
<A NAME="325"></A>are when they listen to diviners, whose ambiguous utterances are received 
<A NAME="326"></A>with nods of acquiescence- <BR><BR>"Croesus by crossing the Halys will 
<A NAME="327"></A>ruin a mighty realm. "<BR><BR>

<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>Diviners use these vague generalities about the matter in hand 
<A NAME="329"></A>because their predictions are thus, as a rule, less likely to be falsified. 
<A NAME="330"></A>We are more likely to be right, in the game of 'odd and even', if we simply 
<A NAME="331"></A>guess 'even' or 'odd' than if we guess at the actual number; and the oracle-monger 
<A NAME="332"></A>is more likely to be right if he simply says that a thing will happen than 
<A NAME="333"></A>if he says when it will happen, and therefore he refuses to add a definite 
<A NAME="334"></A>date. All these ambiguities have the same sort of effect, and are to be 
<A NAME="335"></A>avoided unless we have some such object as that mentioned. (4) A fourth 
<A NAME="336"></A>rule is to observe Protagoras' classification of nouns into male, female, 
<A NAME="337"></A>and inanimate; for these distinctions also must be correctly given. 'Upon 
<A NAME="338"></A>her arrival she said her say and departed (e d elthousa kai dialechtheisa 
<A NAME="339"></A>ocheto).' (5) A fifth rule is to express plurality, fewness, and unity 
<A NAME="340"></A>by the correct wording, e.g. 'Having come, they struck me (oi d elthontes 
<A NAME="341"></A>etupton me).'
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>It is a general rule that a written composition should be easy 
<A NAME="343"></A>to read and therefore easy to deliver. This cannot be so where there are 
<A NAME="344"></A>many connecting words or clauses, or where punctuation is hard, as in the 
<A NAME="345"></A>writings of Heracleitus. To punctuate Heracleitus is no easy task, because 
<A NAME="346"></A>we often cannot tell whether a particular word belongs to what precedes 
<A NAME="347"></A>or what follows it. Thus, at the outset of his treatise he says, 'Though 
<A NAME="348"></A>this truth is always men understand it not', where it is not clear with 
<A NAME="349"></A>which of the two clauses the word 'always' should be joined by the punctuation. 
<A NAME="350"></A>Further, the following fact leads to solecism, viz. that the sentence does 
<A NAME="351"></A>not work out properly if you annex to two terms a third which does not 
<A NAME="352"></A>suit them both. Thus either 'sound' or 'colour' will fail to work out properly 
<A NAME="353"></A>with some verbs: 'perceive' will apply to both, 'see' will not. Obscurity 
<A NAME="354"></A>is also caused if, when you intend to insert a number of details, you do 
<A NAME="355"></A>not first make your meaning clear; for instance, if you say, 'I meant, 
<A NAME="356"></A>after telling him this, that and the other thing, to set out', rather than 
<A NAME="357"></A>something of this kind 'I meant to set out after telling him; then this, 
<A NAME="358"></A>that, and the other thing occurred.'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="359"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>The following suggestions will help to give your language impressiveness. 
<A NAME="361"></A>(1) Describe a thing instead of naming it: do not say 'circle', but 'that 
<A NAME="362"></A>surface which extends equally from the middle every way'. To achieve conciseness, 
<A NAME="363"></A>do the opposite-put the name instead of the description. When mentioning 
<A NAME="364"></A>anything ugly or unseemly, use its name if it is the description that is 
<A NAME="365"></A>ugly, and describe it if it is the name that is ugly. (2) Represent things 
<A NAME="366"></A>with the help of metaphors and epithets, being careful to avoid poetical 
<A NAME="367"></A>effects. (3) Use plural for singular, as in poetry, where one finds <BR><BR>"Unto 
<A NAME="368"></A>havens Achaean, "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="369"></A>though only one haven is meant, and <BR><BR>"Here are my letter's many-leaved 
<A NAME="370"></A>folds. "<BR><BR>

<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>(4) Do not bracket two words under one article, but put one article 
<A NAME="372"></A>with each; e.g. 'that wife of ours.' The reverse to secure conciseness; 
<A NAME="373"></A>e.g. 'our wife.' Use plenty of connecting words; conversely, to secure 
<A NAME="374"></A>conciseness, dispense with connectives, while still preserving connexion; 
<A NAME="375"></A>e.g. 'having gone and spoken', and 'having gone, I spoke', respectively. 
<A NAME="376"></A>(6) And the practice of Antimachus, too, is useful-to describe a thing 
<A NAME="377"></A>by mentioning attributes it does not possess; as he does in talking of 
<A NAME="378"></A>Teumessus <BR><BR>"There is a little wind-swept knoll... 
<A NAME="379"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="380"></A>A subject can be developed indefinitely along these lines. You may apply 
<A NAME="381"></A>this method of treatment by negation either to good or to bad qualities, 
<A NAME="382"></A>according to which your subject requires. It is from this source that the 
<A NAME="383"></A>poets draw expressions such as the 'stringless' or 'lyreless' melody, thus 
<A NAME="384"></A>forming epithets out of negations. This device is popular in proportional 
<A NAME="385"></A>metaphors, as when the trumpet's note is called 'a lyreless 
<A NAME="386"></A>melody'.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="387"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="388"></A><BR><BR>Your language will be appropriate if it expresses emotion and character, 
<A NAME="389"></A>and if it corresponds to its subject. 'Correspondence to subject' means 
<A NAME="390"></A>that we must neither speak casually about weighty matters, nor solemnly 
<A NAME="391"></A>about trivial ones; nor must we add ornamental epithets to commonplace 
<A NAME="392"></A>nouns, or the effect will be comic, as in the works of Cleophon, who can 
<A NAME="393"></A>use phrases as absurd as 'O queenly fig-tree'. To express emotion, you 
<A NAME="394"></A>will employ the language of anger in speaking of outrage; the language 
<A NAME="395"></A>of disgust and discreet reluctance to utter a word when speaking of impiety 
<A NAME="396"></A>or foulness; the language of exultation for a tale of glory, and that of 
<A NAME="397"></A>humiliation for a tale of and so in all other cases.
<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>This aptness of language is one thing that makes people believe 
<A NAME="399"></A>in the truth of your story: their minds draw the false conclusion that 
<A NAME="400"></A>you are to be trusted from the fact that others behave as you do when things 
<A NAME="401"></A>are as you describe them; and therefore they take your story to be true, 
<A NAME="402"></A>whether it is so or not. Besides, an emotional speaker always makes his 
<A NAME="403"></A>audience feel with him, even when there is nothing in his arguments; which 
<A NAME="404"></A>is why many speakers try to overwhelm their audience by mere 
<A NAME="405"></A>noise.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore, this way of proving your story by displaying these 
<A NAME="407"></A>signs of its genuineness expresses your personal character. Each class 
<A NAME="408"></A>of men, each type of disposition, will have its own appropriate way of 
<A NAME="409"></A>letting the truth appear. Under 'class' I include differences of age, as 
<A NAME="410"></A>boy, man, or old man; of sex, as man or woman; of nationality, as Spartan 
<A NAME="411"></A>or Thessalian. By 'dispositions' I here mean those dispositions only which 
<A NAME="412"></A>determine the character of a man's for it is not every disposition that 
<A NAME="413"></A>does this. If, then, a speaker uses the very words which are in keeping 
<A NAME="414"></A>with a particular disposition, he will reproduce the corresponding character; 
<A NAME="415"></A>for a rustic and an educated man will not say the same things nor speak 
<A NAME="416"></A>in the same way. Again, some impression is made upon an audience by a device 
<A NAME="417"></A>which speech-writers employ to nauseous excess, when they say 'Who does 
<A NAME="418"></A>not know this?' or 'It is known to everybody.' The hearer is ashamed of 
<A NAME="419"></A>his ignorance, and agrees with the speaker, so as to have a share of the 
<A NAME="420"></A>knowledge that everybody else possesses.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>All the variations of oratorical style are capable of being used 
<A NAME="422"></A>in season or out of season. The best way to counteract any exaggeration 
<A NAME="423"></A>is the well-worn device by which the speaker puts in some criticism of 
<A NAME="424"></A>himself; for then people feel it must be all right for him to talk thus, 
<A NAME="425"></A>since he certainly knows what he is doing. Further, it is better not to 
<A NAME="426"></A>have everything always just corresponding to everything else-your hearers 
<A NAME="427"></A>will see through you less easily thus. I mean for instance, if your words 
<A NAME="428"></A>are harsh, you should not extend this harshness to your voice and your 
<A NAME="429"></A>countenance and have everything else in keeping. If you do, the artificial 
<A NAME="430"></A>character of each detail becomes apparent; whereas if you adopt one device 
<A NAME="431"></A>and not another, you are using art all the same and yet nobody notices 
<A NAME="432"></A>it. (To be sure, if mild sentiments are expressed in harsh tones and harsh 
<A NAME="433"></A>sentiments in mild tones, you become comparatively unconvincing.) Compound 
<A NAME="434"></A>words, fairly plentiful epithets, and strange words best suit an emotional 
<A NAME="435"></A>speech. We forgive an angry man for talking about a wrong as 'heaven-high' 
<A NAME="436"></A>or 'colossal'; and we excuse such language when the speaker has his hearers 
<A NAME="437"></A>already in his hands and has stirred them deeply either by praise or blame 
<A NAME="438"></A>or anger or affection, as Isocrates, for instance, does at the end of his 
<A NAME="439"></A>Panegyric, with his 'name and fame' and 'in that they brooked'. Men do 
<A NAME="440"></A>speak in this strain when they are deeply stirred, and so, once the audience 
<A NAME="441"></A>is in a like state of feeling, approval of course follows. This is why 
<A NAME="442"></A>such language is fitting in poetry, which is an inspired thing. This language, 
<A NAME="443"></A>then, should be used either under stress of emotion, or ironically, after 
<A NAME="444"></A>the manner of Gorgias and of the passages in the Phaedrus.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="445"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR>The form of a prose composition should be neither metrical nor 
<A NAME="447"></A>destitute of rhythm. The metrical form destroys the hearer's trust by its 
<A NAME="448"></A>artificial appearance, and at the same time it diverts his attention, making 
<A NAME="449"></A>him watch for metrical recurrences, just as children catch up the herald's 
<A NAME="450"></A>question, 'Whom does the freedman choose as his advocate?', with the answer 
<A NAME="451"></A>'Cleon!' On the other hand, unrhythmical language is too unlimited; we 
<A NAME="452"></A>do not want the limitations of metre, but some limitation we must have, 
<A NAME="453"></A>or the effect will be vague and unsatisfactory. Now it is number that limits 
<A NAME="454"></A>all things; and it is the numerical limitation of the forms of a composition 
<A NAME="455"></A>that constitutes rhythm, of which metres are definite sections. Prose, 
<A NAME="456"></A>then, is to be rhythmical, but not metrical, or it will become not prose 
<A NAME="457"></A>but verse. It should not even have too precise a prose rhythm, and therefore 
<A NAME="458"></A>should only be rhythmical to a certain extent.
<A NAME="459"></A><BR><BR>Of the various rhythms, the heroic has dignity, but lacks the tones 
<A NAME="460"></A>of the spoken language. The iambic is the very language of ordinary people, 
<A NAME="461"></A>so that in common talk iambic lines occur oftener than any others: but 
<A NAME="462"></A>in a speech we need dignity and the power of taking the hearer out of his 
<A NAME="463"></A>ordinary self. The trochee is too much akin to wild dancing: we can see 
<A NAME="464"></A>this in tetrameter verse, which is one of the trochaic 
<A NAME="465"></A>rhythms.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR>There remains the paean, which speakers began to use in the time 
<A NAME="467"></A>of Thrasymachus, though they had then no name to give it. The paean is 
<A NAME="468"></A>a third class of rhythm, closely akin to both the two already mentioned; 
<A NAME="469"></A>it has in it the ratio of three to two, whereas the other two kinds have 
<A NAME="470"></A>the ratio of one to one, and two to one respectively. Between the two last 
<A NAME="471"></A>ratios comes the ratio of one-and-a-half to one, which is that of the 
<A NAME="472"></A>paean.
<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>Now the other two kinds of rhythm must be rejected in writing prose, 
<A NAME="474"></A>partly for the reasons given, and partly because they are too metrical; 
<A NAME="475"></A>and the paean must be adopted, since from this alone of the rhythms mentioned 
<A NAME="476"></A>no definite metre arises, and therefore it is the least obtrusive of them. 
<A NAME="477"></A>At present the same form of paean is employed at the beginning a at the 
<A NAME="478"></A>end of sentences, whereas the end should differ from the beginning. There 
<A NAME="479"></A>are two opposite kinds of paean, one of which is suitable to the beginning 
<A NAME="480"></A>of a sentence, where it is indeed actually used; this is the kind that 
<A NAME="481"></A>begins with a long syllable and ends with three short ones, as <BR><BR>"Dalogenes 
<A NAME="482"></A>| eite Luki | an, "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="483"></A>and <BR><BR>"Chruseokom | a Ekate | pai Dios. "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="484"></A>The other paean begins, conversely, with three short syllables and ends 
<A NAME="485"></A>with a long one, as <BR><BR>"meta de lan | udata t ok | eanon e | oanise 
<A NAME="486"></A>nux. "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="487"></A>This kind of paean makes a real close: a short syllable can give no effect 
<A NAME="488"></A>of finality, and therefore makes the rhythm appear truncated. A sentence 
<A NAME="489"></A>should break off with the long syllable: the fact that it is over should 
<A NAME="490"></A>be indicated not by the scribe, or by his period-mark in the margin, but 
<A NAME="491"></A>by the rhythm itself.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>We have now seen that our language must be rhythmical and not destitute 
<A NAME="493"></A>of rhythm, and what rhythms, in what particular shape, make it 
<A NAME="494"></A>so.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="495"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>The language of prose must be either free-running, with its parts 
<A NAME="497"></A>united by nothing except the connecting words, like the preludes in dithyrambs; 
<A NAME="498"></A>or compact and antithetical, like the strophes of the old poets. The free-running 
<A NAME="499"></A>style is the ancient one, e.g. 'Herein is set forth the inquiry of Herodotus 
<A NAME="500"></A>the Thurian.' Every one used this method formerly; not many do so now. 
<A NAME="501"></A>By 'free-running' style I mean the kind that has no natural stopping-places, 
<A NAME="502"></A>and comes to a stop only because there is no more to say of that subject. 
<A NAME="503"></A>This style is unsatisfying just because it goes on indefinitely-one always 
<A NAME="504"></A>likes to sight a stopping-place in front of one: it is only at the goal 
<A NAME="505"></A>that men in a race faint and collapse; while they see the end of the course 
<A NAME="506"></A>before them, they can keep on going. Such, then, is the free-running kind 
<A NAME="507"></A>of style; the compact is that which is in periods. By a period I mean a 
<A NAME="508"></A>portion of speech that has in itself a beginning and an end, being at the 
<A NAME="509"></A>same time not too big to be taken in at a glance. Language of this kind 
<A NAME="510"></A>is satisfying and easy to follow. It is satisfying, because it is just 
<A NAME="511"></A>the reverse of indefinite; and moreover, the hearer always feels that he 
<A NAME="512"></A>is grasping something and has reached some definite conclusion; whereas 
<A NAME="513"></A>it is unsatisfactory to see nothing in front of you and get nowhere. It 
<A NAME="514"></A>is easy to follow, because it can easily be remembered; and this because 
<A NAME="515"></A>language when in periodic form can be numbered, and number is the easiest 
<A NAME="516"></A>of all things to remember. That is why verse, which is measured, is always 
<A NAME="517"></A>more easily remembered than prose, which is not: the measures of verse 
<A NAME="518"></A>can be numbered. The period must, further, not be completed until the sense 
<A NAME="519"></A>is complete: it must not be capable of breaking off abruptly, as may happen 
<A NAME="520"></A>with the following iambic lines of Sophocles- <BR><BR>"Calydon's soil is 
<A NAME="521"></A>this; of Pelops' land <BR><BR>"(The smiling plains face us across the strait.) 
<A NAME="522"></A>"<BR><BR>

<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>By a wrong division of the words the hearer may take the meaning 
<A NAME="524"></A>to be the reverse of what it is: for instance, in the passage quoted, one 
<A NAME="525"></A>might imagine that Calydon is in the Peloponnesus.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>A Period may be either divided into several members or simple. 
<A NAME="527"></A>The period of several members is a portion of speech (1) complete in itself, 
<A NAME="528"></A>(2) divided into parts, and (3) easily delivered at a single breath-as 
<A NAME="529"></A>a whole, that is; not by fresh breath being taken at the division. A member 
<A NAME="530"></A>is one of the two parts of such a period. By a 'simple' period, I mean 
<A NAME="531"></A>that which has only one member. The members, and the whole periods, should 
<A NAME="532"></A>be neither curt nor long. A member which is too short often makes the listener 
<A NAME="533"></A>stumble; he is still expecting the rhythm to go on to the limit his mind 
<A NAME="534"></A>has fixed for it; and if meanwhile he is pulled back by the speaker's stopping, 
<A NAME="535"></A>the shock is bound to make him, so to speak, stumble. If, on the other 
<A NAME="536"></A>hand, you go on too long, you make him feel left behind, just as people 
<A NAME="537"></A>who when walking pass beyond the boundary before turning back leave their 
<A NAME="538"></A>companions behind So too if a period is too long you turn it into a speech, 
<A NAME="539"></A>or something like a dithyrambic prelude. The result is much like the preludes 
<A NAME="540"></A>that Democritus of Chios jeered at Melanippides for writing instead of 
<A NAME="541"></A>antistrophic stanzas- <BR><BR>"He that sets traps for another man's feet 
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>"Is like to fall into them first; <BR><BR>"And long-winded preludes 
<A NAME="543"></A>do harm to us all, <BR><BR>"But the preluder catches it worst. 
<A NAME="544"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="545"></A>Which applies likewise to long-membered orators. Periods whose members 
<A NAME="546"></A>are altogether too short are not periods at all; and the result is to bring 
<A NAME="547"></A>the hearer down with a crash.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR>The periodic style which is divided into members is of two kinds. 
<A NAME="549"></A>It is either simply divided, as in 'I have often wondered at the conveners 
<A NAME="550"></A>of national gatherings and the founders of athletic contests'; or it is 
<A NAME="551"></A>antithetical, where, in each of the two members, one of one pair of opposites 
<A NAME="552"></A>is put along with one of another pair, or the same word is used to bracket 
<A NAME="553"></A>two opposites, as 'They aided both parties-not only those who stayed behind 
<A NAME="554"></A>but those who accompanied them: for the latter they acquired new territory 
<A NAME="555"></A>larger than that at home, and to the former they left territory at home 
<A NAME="556"></A>that was large enough'. Here the contrasted words are 'staying behind' 
<A NAME="557"></A>and 'accompanying', 'enough' and 'larger'. So in the example, 'Both to 
<A NAME="558"></A>those who want to get property and to those who desire to enjoy it' where 
<A NAME="559"></A>'enjoyment' is contrasted with 'getting'. Again, 'it often happens in such 
<A NAME="560"></A>enterprises that the wise men fail and the fools succeed'; 'they were awarded 
<A NAME="561"></A>the prize of valour immediately, and won the command of the sea not long 
<A NAME="562"></A>afterwards'; 'to sail through the mainland and march through the sea, by 
<A NAME="563"></A>bridging the Hellespont and cutting through Athos'; 'nature gave them their 
<A NAME="564"></A>country and law took it away again'; 'of them perished in misery, others 
<A NAME="565"></A>were saved in disgrace'; 'Athenian citizens keep foreigners in their houses 
<A NAME="566"></A>as servants, while the city of Athens allows her allies by thousands to 
<A NAME="567"></A>live as the foreigner's slaves'; and 'to possess in life or to bequeath 
<A NAME="568"></A>at death'. There is also what some one said about Peitholaus and Lycophron 
<A NAME="569"></A>in a law-court, 'These men used to sell you when they were at home, and 
<A NAME="570"></A>now they have come to you here and bought you'. All these passages have 
<A NAME="571"></A>the structure described above. Such a form of speech is satisfying, because 
<A NAME="572"></A>the significance of contrasted ideas is easily felt, especially when they 
<A NAME="573"></A>are thus put side by side, and also because it has the effect of a logical 
<A NAME="574"></A>argument; it is by putting two opposing conclusions side by side that you 
<A NAME="575"></A>prove one of them false.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>Such, then, is the nature of antithesis. Parisosis is making the 
<A NAME="577"></A>two members of a period equal in length. Paromoeosis is making the extreme 
<A NAME="578"></A>words of both members like each other. This must happen either at the beginning 
<A NAME="579"></A>or at the end of each member. If at the beginning, the resemblance must 
<A NAME="580"></A>always be between whole words; at the end, between final syllables or inflexions 
<A NAME="581"></A>of the same word or the same word repeated. Thus, at the beginning <BR><BR>"agron 
<A NAME="582"></A>gar elaben arlon par' autou "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="583"></A>and <BR><BR>"dorhetoi t epelonto pararretoi t epeessin 
<A NAME="584"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="585"></A>At the end <BR><BR>"ouk wethesan auton paidion tetokenai, <BR><BR>"all 
<A NAME="586"></A>autou aitlon lelonenai, "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="587"></A>and <BR><BR>"en pleiotals de opontisi kai en elachistais elpisin 
<A NAME="588"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="589"></A>An example of inflexions of the same word is <BR><BR>"axios de staoenai 
<A NAME="590"></A>chalkous ouk axios on chalkou; "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="591"></A>Of the same word repeated, <BR><BR>"su d' auton kai zonta eleges kakos 
<A NAME="592"></A>kai nun grafeis kakos. "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="593"></A>Of one syllable, <BR><BR>"ti d' an epaoes deinon, ei andrh' eides arhgon; 
<A NAME="594"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="595"></A>It is possible for the same sentence to have all these features together-antithesis, 
<A NAME="596"></A>parison, and homoeoteleuton. (The possible beginnings of periods have been 
<A NAME="597"></A>pretty fully enumerated in the Theodectea.) There are also spurious antitheses, 
<A NAME="598"></A>like that of Epicharmus- <BR><BR>"There one time I as their guest did stay, 
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>"And they were my hosts on another day. "<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
<A NAME="600"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>We may now consider the above points settled, and pass on to say 
<A NAME="602"></A>something about the way to devise lively and taking sayings. Their actual 
<A NAME="603"></A>invention can only come through natural talent or long practice; but this 
<A NAME="604"></A>treatise may indicate the way it is done. We may deal with them by enumerating 
<A NAME="605"></A>the different kinds of them. We will begin by remarking that we all naturally 
<A NAME="606"></A>find it agreeable to get hold of new ideas easily: words express ideas, 
<A NAME="607"></A>and therefore those words are the most agreeable that enable us to get 
<A NAME="608"></A>hold of new ideas. Now strange words simply puzzle us; ordinary words convey 
<A NAME="609"></A>only what we know already; it is from metaphor that we can best get hold 
<A NAME="610"></A>of something fresh. When the poet calls 'old age a withered stalk', he 
<A NAME="611"></A>conveys a new idea, a new fact, to us by means of the general notion of 
<A NAME="612"></A>bloom, which is common to both things. The similes of the poets do the 
<A NAME="613"></A>same, and therefore, if they are good similes, give an effect of brilliance. 
<A NAME="614"></A>The simile, as has been said before, is a metaphor, differing from it only 
<A NAME="615"></A>in the way it is put; and just because it is longer it is less attractive. 
<A NAME="616"></A>Besides, it does not say outright that 'this' is 'that', and therefore 
<A NAME="617"></A>the hearer is less interested in the idea. We see, then, that both speech 
<A NAME="618"></A>and reasoning are lively in proportion as they make us seize a new idea 
<A NAME="619"></A>promptly. For this reason people are not much taken either by obvious arguments 
<A NAME="620"></A>(using the word 'obvious' to mean what is plain to everybody and needs 
<A NAME="621"></A>no investigation), nor by those which puzzle us when we hear them stated, 
<A NAME="622"></A>but only by those which convey their information to us as soon as we hear 
<A NAME="623"></A>them, provided we had not the information already; or which the mind only 
<A NAME="624"></A>just fails to keep up with. These two kinds do convey to us a sort of information: 
<A NAME="625"></A>but the obvious and the obscure kinds convey nothing, either at once or 
<A NAME="626"></A>later on. It is these qualities, then, that, so far as the meaning of what 
<A NAME="627"></A>is said is concerned, make an argument acceptable. So far as the style 
<A NAME="628"></A>is concerned, it is the antithetical form that appeals to us, e.g. 'judging 
<A NAME="629"></A>that the peace common to all the rest was a war upon their own private 
<A NAME="630"></A>interests', where there is an antithesis between war and peace. It is also 
<A NAME="631"></A>good to use metaphorical words; but the metaphors must not be far-fetched, 
<A NAME="632"></A>or they will be difficult to grasp, nor obvious, or they will have no effect. 
<A NAME="633"></A>The words, too, ought to set the scene before our eyes; for events ought 
<A NAME="634"></A>to be seen in progress rather than in prospect. So we must aim at these 
<A NAME="635"></A>three points: Antithesis, Metaphor, and Actuality.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>Of the four kinds of Metaphor the most taking is the proportional 
<A NAME="637"></A>kind. Thus Pericles, for instance, said that the vanishing from their country 
<A NAME="638"></A>of the young men who had fallen in the war was 'as if the spring were taken 
<A NAME="639"></A>out of the year'. Leptines, speaking of the Lacedaemonians, said that he 
<A NAME="640"></A>would not have the Athenians let Greece 'lose one of her two eyes'. When 
<A NAME="641"></A>Chares was pressing for leave to be examined upon his share in the Olynthiac 
<A NAME="642"></A>war, Cephisodotus was indignant, saying that he wanted his examination 
<A NAME="643"></A>to take place 'while he had his fingers upon the people's throat'. The 
<A NAME="644"></A>same speaker once urged the Athenians to march to Euboea, 'with Miltiades' 
<A NAME="645"></A>decree as their rations'. Iphicrates, indignant at the truce made by the 
<A NAME="646"></A>Athenians with Epidaurus and the neighbouring sea-board, said that they 
<A NAME="647"></A>had stripped themselves of their travelling money for the journey of war. 
<A NAME="648"></A>Peitholaus called the state-galley 'the people's big stick', and Sestos 
<A NAME="649"></A>'the corn-bin of the Peiraeus'. Pericles bade his countrymen remove Aegina, 
<A NAME="650"></A>'that eyesore of the Peiraeus.' And Moerocles said he was no more a rascal 
<A NAME="651"></A>than was a certain respectable citizen he named, 'whose rascality was worth 
<A NAME="652"></A>over thirty per cent per annum to him, instead of a mere ten like his own'.There 
<A NAME="653"></A>is also the iambic line of Anaxandrides about the way his daughters put 
<A NAME="654"></A>off marrying- <BR><BR>"My daughters' marriage-bonds are overdue. 
<A NAME="655"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="656"></A>Polyeuctus said of a paralytic man named Speusippus that he could not keep 
<A NAME="657"></A>quiet, 'though fortune had fastened him in the pillory of disease'. Cephisodotus 
<A NAME="658"></A>called warships 'painted millstones'. Diogenes the Dog called taverns 'the 
<A NAME="659"></A>mess-rooms of Attica'. Aesion said that the Athenians had 'emptied' their 
<A NAME="660"></A>town into Sicily: this is a graphic metaphor. 'Till all Hellas shouted 
<A NAME="661"></A>aloud' may be regarded as a metaphor, and a graphic one again. Cephisodotus 
<A NAME="662"></A>bade the Athenians take care not to hold too many 'parades'. Isocrates 
<A NAME="663"></A>used the same word of those who 'parade at the national festivals.' Another 
<A NAME="664"></A>example occurs in the Funeral Speech: 'It is fitting that Greece should 
<A NAME="665"></A>cut off her hair beside the tomb of those who fell at Salamis, since her 
<A NAME="666"></A>freedom and their valour are buried in the same grave.' Even if the speaker 
<A NAME="667"></A>here had only said that it was right to weep when valour was being buried 
<A NAME="668"></A>in their grave, it would have been a metaphor, and a graphic one; but the 
<A NAME="669"></A>coupling of 'their valour' and 'her freedom' presents a kind of antithesis 
<A NAME="670"></A>as well. 'The course of my words', said Iphicrates, 'lies straight through 
<A NAME="671"></A>the middle of Chares' deeds': this is a proportional metaphor, and the 
<A NAME="672"></A>phrase 'straight through the middle' makes it graphic. The expression 'to 
<A NAME="673"></A>call in one danger to rescue us from another' is a graphic metaphor. Lycoleon 
<A NAME="674"></A>said, defending Chabrias, 'They did not respect even that bronze statue 
<A NAME="675"></A>of his that intercedes for him yonder'.This was a metaphor for the moment, 
<A NAME="676"></A>though it would not always apply; a vivid metaphor, however; Chabrias is 
<A NAME="677"></A>in danger, and his statue intercedes for him-that lifeless yet living thing 
<A NAME="678"></A>which records his services to his country. 'Practising in every way littleness 
<A NAME="679"></A>of mind' is metaphorical, for practising a quality implies increasing it. 
<A NAME="680"></A>So is 'God kindled our reason to be a lamp within our soul', for both reason 
<A NAME="681"></A>and light reveal things. So is 'we are not putting an end to our wars, 
<A NAME="682"></A>but only postponing them', for both literal postponement and the making 
<A NAME="683"></A>of such a peace as this apply to future action. So is such a saying as 
<A NAME="684"></A>'This treaty is a far nobler trophy than those we set up on fields of battle; 
<A NAME="685"></A>they celebrate small gains and single successes; it celebrates our triumph 
<A NAME="686"></A>in the war as a whole'; for both trophy and treaty are signs of victory. 
<A NAME="687"></A>So is 'A country pays a heavy reckoning in being condemned by the judgement 
<A NAME="688"></A>of mankind', for a reckoning is damage deservedly incurred.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="689"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>It has already been mentioned that liveliness is got by using the 
<A NAME="691"></A>proportional type of metaphor and being making (ie. making your hearers 
<A NAME="692"></A>see things). We have still to explain what we mean by their 'seeing things', 
<A NAME="693"></A>and what must be done to effect this. By 'making them see things' I mean 
<A NAME="694"></A>using expressions that represent things as in a state of activity. Thus, 
<A NAME="695"></A>to say that a good man is 'four-square' is certainly a metaphor; both the 
<A NAME="696"></A>good man and the square are perfect; but the metaphor does not suggest 
<A NAME="697"></A>activity. On the other hand, in the expression 'with his vigour in full 
<A NAME="698"></A>bloom' there is a notion of activity; and so in 'But you must roam as free 
<A NAME="699"></A>as a sacred victim'; and in <BR><BR>"Thereas up sprang the Hellenes to 
<A NAME="700"></A>their feet, "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="701"></A>where 'up sprang' gives us activity as well as metaphor, for it at once 
<A NAME="702"></A>suggests swiftness. So with Homer's common practice of giving metaphorical 
<A NAME="703"></A>life to lifeless things: all such passages are distinguished by the effect 
<A NAME="704"></A>of activity they convey. Thus, <BR><BR>"Downward anon to the valley rebounded 
<A NAME="705"></A>the boulder remorseless; and "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR>"The (bitter) arrow flew; "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="707"></A>and <BR><BR>"Flying on eagerly; and "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="708"></A>Stuck in the earth, still panting to feed on the flesh of the heroes; and 
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR>"And the point of the spear in its fury drove <BR><BR>"full through 
<A NAME="710"></A>his breastbone. "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="711"></A>In all these examples the things have the effect of being active because 
<A NAME="712"></A>they are made into living beings; shameless behaviour and fury and so on 
<A NAME="713"></A>are all forms of activity. And the poet has attached these ideas to the 
<A NAME="714"></A>things by means of proportional metaphors: as the stone is to Sisyphus, 
<A NAME="715"></A>so is the shameless man to his victim. In his famous similes, too, he treats 
<A NAME="716"></A>inanimate things in the same way: <BR><BR>"Curving and crested with white, 
<A NAME="717"></A>host following <BR><BR>"host without ceasing. "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="718"></A>Here he represents everything as moving and living; and activity is 
<A NAME="719"></A>movement.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR>Metaphors must be drawn, as has been said already, from things 
<A NAME="721"></A>that are related to the original thing, and yet not obviously so related-just 
<A NAME="722"></A>as in philosophy also an acute mind will perceive resemblances even in 
<A NAME="723"></A>things far apart. Thus Archytas said that an arbitrator and an altar were 
<A NAME="724"></A>the same, since the injured fly to both for refuge. Or you might say that 
<A NAME="725"></A>an anchor and an overhead hook were the same, since both are in a way the 
<A NAME="726"></A>same, only the one secures things from below and the other from above. 
<A NAME="727"></A>And to speak of states as 'levelled' is to identify two widely different 
<A NAME="728"></A>things, the equality of a physical surface and the equality of political 
<A NAME="729"></A>powers.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR><BR>Liveliness is specially conveyed by metaphor, and by the further 
<A NAME="731"></A>power of surprising the hearer; because the hearer expected something different, 
<A NAME="732"></A>his acquisition of the new idea impresses him all the more. His mind seems 
<A NAME="733"></A>to say, 'Yes, to be sure; I never thought of that'. The liveliness of epigrammatic 
<A NAME="734"></A>remarks is due to the meaning not being just what the words say: as in 
<A NAME="735"></A>the saying of Stesichorus that 'the cicalas will chirp to themselves on 
<A NAME="736"></A>the ground'. Well-constructed riddles are attractive for the same reason; 
<A NAME="737"></A>a new idea is conveyed, and there is metaphorical expression. So with the 
<A NAME="738"></A>'novelties' of Theodorus. In these the thought is startling, and, as Theodorus 
<A NAME="739"></A>puts it, does not fit in with the ideas you already have. They are like 
<A NAME="740"></A>the burlesque words that one finds in the comic writers. The effect is 
<A NAME="741"></A>produced even by jokes depending upon changes of the letters of a word; 
<A NAME="742"></A>this too is a surprise. You find this in verse as well as in prose. The 
<A NAME="743"></A>word which comes is not what the hearer imagined: thus <BR><BR>"Onward 
<A NAME="744"></A>he came, and his feet were shod with his-chilblains, 
<A NAME="745"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="746"></A>where one imagined the word would be 'sandals'. But the point should be 
<A NAME="747"></A>clear the moment the words are uttered. Jokes made by altering the letters 
<A NAME="748"></A>of a word consist in meaning, not just what you say, but something that 
<A NAME="749"></A>gives a twist to the word used; e.g. the remark of Theodorus about Nicon 
<A NAME="750"></A>the harpist Thratt' ei su ('you Thracian slavey'), where he pretends to 
<A NAME="751"></A>mean Thratteis su ('you harpplayer'), and surprises us when we find he 
<A NAME="752"></A>means something else. So you enjoy the point when you see it, though the 
<A NAME="753"></A>remark will fall flat unless you are aware that Nicon is Thracian. Or again: 
<A NAME="754"></A>Boulei auton persai. In both these cases the saying must fit the facts. 
<A NAME="755"></A>This is also true of such lively remarks as the one to the effect that 
<A NAME="756"></A>to the Athenians their empire (arche) of the sea was not the beginning 
<A NAME="757"></A>(arche) of their troubles, since they gained by it. Or the opposite one 
<A NAME="758"></A>of Isocrates, that their empire (arche) was the beginning (arche) of their 
<A NAME="759"></A>troubles. Either way, the speaker says something unexpected, the soundness 
<A NAME="760"></A>of which is thereupon recognized. There would be nothing clever is saying 
<A NAME="761"></A>'empire is empire'. Isocrates means more than that, and uses the word with 
<A NAME="762"></A>a new meaning. So too with the former saying, which denies that arche in 
<A NAME="763"></A>one sense was arche in another sense. In all these jokes, whether a word 
<A NAME="764"></A>is used in a second sense or metaphorically, the joke is good if it fits 
<A NAME="765"></A>the facts. For instance, Anaschetos (proper name) ouk anaschetos: where 
<A NAME="766"></A>you say that what is so-and-so in one sense is not so-and-so in another; 
<A NAME="767"></A>well, if the man is unpleasant, the joke fits the facts. Again, take- <BR><BR>"Thou 
<A NAME="768"></A>must not be a stranger stranger than Thou should'st. 
<A NAME="769"></A>"<BR><BR>

<A NAME="770"></A><BR><BR>Do not the words 'thou must not be', &c., amount to saying that 
<A NAME="771"></A>the stranger must not always be strange? Here again is the use of one word 
<A NAME="772"></A>in different senses. Of the same kind also is the much-praised verse of 
<A NAME="773"></A>Anaxandrides: <BR><BR>"Death is most fit before you do <BR><BR>"Deeds that 
<A NAME="774"></A>would make death fit for you. "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="775"></A>This amounts to saying 'it is a fit thing to die when you are not fit to 
<A NAME="776"></A>die', or 'it is a fit thing to die when death is not fit for you', i.e. 
<A NAME="777"></A>when death is not the fit return for what you are doing. The type of language 
<A NAME="778"></A>employed-is the same in all these examples; but the more briefly and antithetically 
<A NAME="779"></A>such sayings can be expressed, the more taking they are, for antithesis 
<A NAME="780"></A>impresses the new idea more firmly and brevity more quickly. They should 
<A NAME="781"></A>always have either some personal application or some merit of expression, 
<A NAME="782"></A>if they are to be true without being commonplace-two requirements not always 
<A NAME="783"></A>satisfied simultaneously. Thus 'a man should die having done no wrong' 
<A NAME="784"></A>is true but dull: 'the right man should marry the right woman' is also 
<A NAME="785"></A>true but dull. No, there must be both good qualities together, as in 'it 
<A NAME="786"></A>is fitting to die when you are not fit for death'. The more a saying has 
<A NAME="787"></A>these qualitis, the livelier it appears: if, for instance, its wording 
<A NAME="788"></A>is metaphorical, metaphorical in the right way, antithetical, and balanced, 
<A NAME="789"></A>and at the same time it gives an idea of activity.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR><BR>Successful similes also, as has been said above, are in a sense 
<A NAME="791"></A>metaphors, since they always involve two relations like the proportional 
<A NAME="792"></A>metaphor. Thus: a shield, we say, is the 'drinking-bowl of Ares', and a 
<A NAME="793"></A>bow is the 'chordless lyre'. This way of putting a metaphor is not 'simple', 
<A NAME="794"></A>as it would be if we called the bow a lyre or the shield a drinking-bowl. 
<A NAME="795"></A>There are 'simple' similes also: we may say that a flute-player is like 
<A NAME="796"></A>a monkey, or that a short-sighted man's eyes are like a lamp-flame with 
<A NAME="797"></A>water dropping on it, since both eyes and flame keep winking. A simile 
<A NAME="798"></A>succeeds best when it is a converted metaphor, for it is possible to say 
<A NAME="799"></A>that a shield is like the drinking-bowl of Ares, or that a ruin is like 
<A NAME="800"></A>a house in rags, and to say that Niceratus is like a Philoctetes stung 
<A NAME="801"></A>by Pratys-the simile made by Thrasyniachus when he saw Niceratus, who had 
<A NAME="802"></A>been beaten by Pratys in a recitation competition, still going about unkempt 
<A NAME="803"></A>and unwashed. It is in these respects that poets fail worst when they fail, 
<A NAME="804"></A>and succeed best when they succeed, i.e. when they give the resemblance 
<A NAME="805"></A>pat, as in <BR><BR>"Those legs of his curl just like parsley leaves; 
<A NAME="806"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="807"></A>and <BR><BR>"Just like Philammon struggling with his punchball. 
<A NAME="808"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="809"></A>These are all similes; and that similes are metaphors has been stated often 
<A NAME="810"></A>already.
<A NAME="811"></A><BR><BR>Proverbs, again, are metaphors from one species to another. Suppose, 
<A NAME="812"></A>for instance, a man to start some undertaking in hope of gain and then 
<A NAME="813"></A>to lose by it later on, 'Here we have once more the man of Carpathus and 
<A NAME="814"></A>his hare', says he. For both alike went through the said 
<A NAME="815"></A>experience.
<A NAME="816"></A><BR><BR>It has now been explained fairly completely how liveliness is secured 
<A NAME="817"></A>and why it has the effect it has. Successful hyperboles are also metaphors, 
<A NAME="818"></A>e.g. the one about the man with a black eye, 'you would have thought he 
<A NAME="819"></A>was a basket of mulberries'; here the 'black eye' is compared to a mulberry 
<A NAME="820"></A>because of its colour, the exaggeration lying in the quantity of mulberries 
<A NAME="821"></A>suggested. The phrase 'like so-and-so' may introduce a hyperbole under 
<A NAME="822"></A>the form of a simile. Thus <BR><BR>"Just like Philammon struggling with 
<A NAME="823"></A>his punchball "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="824"></A>is equivalent to 'you would have thought he was Philammon struggling with 
<A NAME="825"></A>his punchball'; and <BR><BR>"Those legs of his curl just like parsley leaves 
<A NAME="826"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="827"></A>is equivalent to 'his legs are so curly that you would have thought they 
<A NAME="828"></A>were not legs but parsley leaves'. Hyperboles are for young men to use; 
<A NAME="829"></A>they show vehemence of character; and this is why angry people use them 
<A NAME="830"></A>more than other people. <BR><BR>"Not though he gave me as much as the dust 
<A NAME="831"></A><BR><BR>"or the sands of the sea... <BR><BR>"But her, the daughter of Atreus' 
<A NAME="832"></A>son, I never will marry, <BR><BR>"Nay, not though she were fairer than 
<A NAME="833"></A>Aphrodite the Golden, <BR><BR>"Defter of hand than Athene... 
<A NAME="834"></A>"<BR><BR>

<A NAME="835"></A><BR><BR>(The Attic orators are particularly fond of this method of speech.) 
<A NAME="836"></A>Consequently it does not suit an elderly speaker.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="837"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="838"></A><BR><BR>It should be observed that each kind of rhetoric has its own appropriate 
<A NAME="839"></A>style. The style of written prose is not that of spoken oratory, nor are 
<A NAME="840"></A>those of political and forensic speaking the same. Both written and spoken 
<A NAME="841"></A>have to be known. To know the latter is to know how to speak good Greek. 
<A NAME="842"></A>To know the former means that you are not obliged, as otherwise you are, 
<A NAME="843"></A>to hold your tongue when you wish to communicate something to the general 
<A NAME="844"></A>public.
<A NAME="845"></A><BR><BR>The written style is the more finished: the spoken better admits 
<A NAME="846"></A>of dramatic delivery-like the kind of oratory that reflects character and 
<A NAME="847"></A>the kind that reflects emotion. Hence actors look out for plays written 
<A NAME="848"></A>in the latter style, and poets for actors competent to act in such plays. 
<A NAME="849"></A>Yet poets whose plays are meant to be read are read and circulated: Chaeremon, 
<A NAME="850"></A>for instance, who is as finished as a professional speech-writer; and Licymnius 
<A NAME="851"></A>among the dithyrambic poets. Compared with those of others, the speeches 
<A NAME="852"></A>of professional writers sound thin in actual contests. Those of the orators, 
<A NAME="853"></A>on the other hand, are good to hear spoken, but look amateurish enough 
<A NAME="854"></A>when they pass into the hands of a reader. This is just because they are 
<A NAME="855"></A>so well suited for an actual tussle, and therefore contain many dramatic 
<A NAME="856"></A>touches, which, being robbed of all dramatic rendering, fail to do their 
<A NAME="857"></A>own proper work, and consequently look silly. Thus strings of unconnected 
<A NAME="858"></A>words, and constant repetitions of words and phrases, are very properly 
<A NAME="859"></A>condemned in written speeches: but not in spoken speeches-speakers use 
<A NAME="860"></A>them freely, for they have a dramatic effect. In this repetition there 
<A NAME="861"></A>must be variety of tone, paving the way, as it were, to dramatic effect; 
<A NAME="862"></A>e.g. 'This is the villain among you who deceived you, who cheated you, 
<A NAME="863"></A>who meant to betray you completely'. This is the sort of thing that Philemon 
<A NAME="864"></A>the actor used to do in the Old Men's Madness of Anaxandrides whenever 
<A NAME="865"></A>he spoke the words 'Rhadamanthus and Palamedes', and also in the prologue 
<A NAME="866"></A>to the Saints whenever he pronounced the pronoun 'I'. If one does not deliver 
<A NAME="867"></A>such things cleverly, it becomes a case of 'the man who swallowed a poker'. 
<A NAME="868"></A>So too with strings of unconnected words, e.g.'I came to him; I met him; 
<A NAME="869"></A>I besought him'. Such passages must be acted, not delivered with the same 
<A NAME="870"></A>quality and pitch of voice, as though they had only one idea in them. They 
<A NAME="871"></A>have the further peculiarity of suggesting that a number of separate statements 
<A NAME="872"></A>have been made in the time usually occupied by one. Just as the use of 
<A NAME="873"></A>conjunctions makes many statements into a single one, so the omission of 
<A NAME="874"></A>conjunctions acts in the reverse way and makes a single one into many. 
<A NAME="875"></A>It thus makes everything more important: e.g. 'I came to him; I talked 
<A NAME="876"></A>to him; I entreated him'-what a lot of facts! the hearer thinks-'he paid 
<A NAME="877"></A>no attention to anything I said'. This is the effect which Homer seeks 
<A NAME="878"></A>when he writes, <BR><BR>"Nireus likewise from Syme (three well-fashioned 
<A NAME="879"></A>ships did bring), <BR><BR>"Nireus, the son of Aglaia (and Charopus, bright-faced 
<A NAME="880"></A>king), <BR><BR>"Nireus, the comeliest man (of all that to Ilium's strand). 
<A NAME="881"></A>"<BR><BR>

<A NAME="882"></A><BR><BR>If many things are said about a man, his name must be mentioned 
<A NAME="883"></A>many times; and therefore people think that, if his name is mentioned many 
<A NAME="884"></A>times, many things have been said about him. So that Homer, by means of 
<A NAME="885"></A>this illusion, has made a great deal of though he has mentioned him only 
<A NAME="886"></A>in this one passage, and has preserved his memory, though he nowhere says 
<A NAME="887"></A>a word about him afterwards.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR><BR>Now the style of oratory addressed to public assemblies is really 
<A NAME="889"></A>just like scene-painting. The bigger the throng, the more distant is the 
<A NAME="890"></A>point of view: so that, in the one and the other, high finish in detail 
<A NAME="891"></A>is superfluous and seems better away. The forensic style is more highly 
<A NAME="892"></A>finished; still more so is the style of language addressed to a single 
<A NAME="893"></A>judge, with whom there is very little room for rhetorical artifices, since 
<A NAME="894"></A>he can take the whole thing in better, and judge of what is to the point 
<A NAME="895"></A>and what is not; the struggle is less intense and so the judgement is undisturbed. 
<A NAME="896"></A>This is why the same speakers do not distinguish themselves in all these 
<A NAME="897"></A>branches at once; high finish is wanted least where dramatic delivery is 
<A NAME="898"></A>wanted most, and here the speaker must have a good voice, and above all, 
<A NAME="899"></A>a strong one. It is ceremonial oratory that is most literary, for it is 
<A NAME="900"></A>meant to be read; and next to it forensic oratory.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR>To analyse style still further, and add that it must be agreeable 
<A NAME="902"></A>or magnificent, is useless; for why should it have these traits any more 
<A NAME="903"></A>than 'restraint', 'liberality', or any other moral excellence? Obviously 
<A NAME="904"></A>agreeableness will be produced by the qualities already mentioned, if our 
<A NAME="905"></A>definition of excellence of style has been correct. For what other reason 
<A NAME="906"></A>should style be 'clear', and 'not mean' but 'appropriate'? If it is prolix, 
<A NAME="907"></A>it is not clear; nor yet if it is curt. Plainly the middle way suits best. 
<A NAME="908"></A>Again, style will be made agreeable by the elements mentioned, namely by 
<A NAME="909"></A>a good blending of ordinary and unusual words, by the rhythm, and by-the 
<A NAME="910"></A>persuasiveness that springs from appropriateness.
<A NAME="911"></A><BR><BR>This concludes our discussion of style, both in its general aspects 
<A NAME="912"></A>and in its special applications to the various branches of rhetoric. We 
<A NAME="913"></A>have now to deal with Arrangement.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="914"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="915"></A><BR><BR>A speech has two parts. You must state your case, and you must 
<A NAME="916"></A>prove it. You cannot either state your case and omit to prove it, or prove 
<A NAME="917"></A>it without having first stated it; since any proof must be a proof of something, 
<A NAME="918"></A>and the only use of a preliminary statement is the proof that follows it. 
<A NAME="919"></A>Of these two parts the first part is called the Statement of the case, 
<A NAME="920"></A>the second part the Argument, just as we distinguish between Enunciation 
<A NAME="921"></A>and Demonstration. The current division is absurd. For 'narration' surely 
<A NAME="922"></A>is part of a forensic speech only: how in a political speech or a speech 
<A NAME="923"></A>of display can there be 'narration' in the technical sense? or a reply 
<A NAME="924"></A>to a forensic opponent? or an epilogue in closely-reasoned speeches? Again, 
<A NAME="925"></A>introduction, comparison of conflicting arguments, and recapitulation are 
<A NAME="926"></A>only found in political speeches when there is a struggle between two policies. 
<A NAME="927"></A>They may occur then; so may even accusation and defence, often enough; 
<A NAME="928"></A>but they form no essential part of a political speech. Even forensic speeches 
<A NAME="929"></A>do not always need epilogues; not, for instance, a short speech, nor one 
<A NAME="930"></A>in which the facts are easy to remember, the effect of an epilogue being 
<A NAME="931"></A>always a reduction in the apparent length. It follows, then, that the only 
<A NAME="932"></A>necessary parts of a speech are the Statement and the Argument. These are 
<A NAME="933"></A>the essential features of a speech; and it cannot in any case have more 
<A NAME="934"></A>than Introduction, Statement, Argument, and Epilogue. 'Refutation of the 
<A NAME="935"></A>Opponent' is part of the arguments: so is 'Comparison' of the opponent's 
<A NAME="936"></A>case with your own, for that process is a magnifying of your own case and 
<A NAME="937"></A>therefore a part of the arguments, since one who does this proves something. 
<A NAME="938"></A>The Introduction does nothing like this; nor does the Epilogue-it merely 
<A NAME="939"></A>reminds us of what has been said already. If we make such distinctions 
<A NAME="940"></A>we shall end, like Theodorus and his followers, by distinguishing 'narration' 
<A NAME="941"></A>proper from 'post-narration' and 'pre-narration', and 'refutation' from 
<A NAME="942"></A>'final refutation'. But we ought only to bring in a new name if it indicates 
<A NAME="943"></A>a real species with distinct specific qualities; otherwise the practice 
<A NAME="944"></A>is pointless and silly, like the way Licymnius invented names in his Art 
<A NAME="945"></A>of Rhetoric-'Secundation', 'Divagation', 'Ramification'.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="946"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="947"></A><BR><BR>The Introduction is the beginning of a speech, corresponding to 
<A NAME="948"></A>the prologue in poetry and the prelude in flute-music; they are all beginnings, 
<A NAME="949"></A>paving the way, as it were, for what is to follow. The musical prelude 
<A NAME="950"></A>resembles the introduction to speeches of display; as flute players play 
<A NAME="951"></A>first some brilliant passage they know well and then fit it on to the opening 
<A NAME="952"></A>notes of the piece itself, so in speeches of display the writer should 
<A NAME="953"></A>proceed in the same way; he should begin with what best takes his fancy, 
<A NAME="954"></A>and then strike up his theme and lead into it; which is indeed what is 
<A NAME="955"></A>always done. (Take as an example the introduction to the Helen of Isocrates-there 
<A NAME="956"></A>is nothing in common between the 'eristics' and Helen.) And here, even 
<A NAME="957"></A>if you travel far from your subject, it is fitting, rather than that there 
<A NAME="958"></A>should be sameness in the entire speech.
<A NAME="959"></A><BR><BR>The usual subject for the introductions to speeches of display 
<A NAME="960"></A>is some piece of praise or censure. Thus Gorgias writes in his Olympic 
<A NAME="961"></A>Speech, 'You deserve widespread admiration, men of Greece', praising thus 
<A NAME="962"></A>those who start,ed the festival gatherings.' Isocrates, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="963"></A>censures them for awarding distinctions to fine athletes but giving no 
<A NAME="964"></A>prize for intellectual ability. Or one may begin with a piece of advice, 
<A NAME="965"></A>thus: 'We ought to honour good men and so I myself am praising Aristeides' 
<A NAME="966"></A>or 'We ought to honour those who are unpopular but not bad men, men whose 
<A NAME="967"></A>good qualities have never been noticed, like Alexander son of Priam.' Here 
<A NAME="968"></A>the orator gives advice. Or we may begin as speakers do in the law-courts; 
<A NAME="969"></A>that is to say, with appeals to the audience to excuse us if our speech 
<A NAME="970"></A>is about something paradoxical, difficult, or hackneyed; like Choerilus 
<A NAME="971"></A>in the lines- <BR><BR>"But now when allotment of all has been made... 
<A NAME="972"></A>"<BR><BR>

<A NAME="973"></A><BR><BR>Introductions to speeches of display, then, may be composed of 
<A NAME="974"></A>some piece of praise or censure, of advice to do or not to do something, 
<A NAME="975"></A>or of appeals to the audience; and you must choose between making these 
<A NAME="976"></A>preliminary passages connected or disconnected with the speech 
<A NAME="977"></A>itself.
<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR>Introductions to forensic speeches, it must be observed, have the 
<A NAME="979"></A>same value as the prologues of dramas and the introductions to epic poems; 
<A NAME="980"></A>the dithyrambic prelude resembling the introduction to a speech of display, 
<A NAME="981"></A>as <BR><BR>"For thee, and thy gilts, and thy battle-spoils.... 
<A NAME="982"></A>"<BR><BR>

<A NAME="983"></A><BR><BR>In prologues, and in epic poetry, a foretaste of the theme is given, 
<A NAME="984"></A>intended to inform the hearers of it in advance instead of keeping their 
<A NAME="985"></A>minds in suspense. Anything vague puzzles them: so give them a grasp of 
<A NAME="986"></A>the beginning, and they can hold fast to it and follow the argument. So 
<A NAME="987"></A>we find- <BR><BR>"Sing, O goddess of song, of the Wrath... <BR><BR>"Tell 
<A NAME="988"></A>me, O Muse, of the hero... <BR><BR>"Lead me to tell a new tale, how there 
<A NAME="989"></A>came great warfare to Europe <BR><BR>"Out of the Asian land... 
<A NAME="990"></A>"<BR><BR>

<A NAME="991"></A><BR><BR>The tragic poets, too, let us know the pivot of their play; if 
<A NAME="992"></A>not at the outset like Euripides, at least somewhere in the preface to 
<A NAME="993"></A>a speech like Sophocles- <BR><BR>"Polybus was my father...; 
<A NAME="994"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="995"></A>and so in Comedy. This, then, is the most essential function and distinctive 
<A NAME="996"></A>property of the introduction, to show what the aim of the speech is; and 
<A NAME="997"></A>therefore no introduction ought to be employed where the subject is not 
<A NAME="998"></A>long or intricate.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR><BR>The other kinds of introduction employed are remedial in purpose, 
<A NAME="1000"></A>and may be used in any type of speech. They are concerned with the speaker, 
<A NAME="1001"></A>the hearer, the subject, or the speaker's opponent. Those concerned with 
<A NAME="1002"></A>the speaker himself or with his opponent are directed to removing or exciting 
<A NAME="1003"></A>prejudice. But whereas the defendant will begin by dealing with this sort 
<A NAME="1004"></A>of thing, the prosecutor will take quite another line and deal with such 
<A NAME="1005"></A>matters in the closing part of his speech. The reason for this is not far 
<A NAME="1006"></A>to seek. The defendant, when he is going to bring himself on the stage, 
<A NAME="1007"></A>must clear away any obstacles, and therefore must begin by removing any 
<A NAME="1008"></A>prejudice felt against him. But if you are to excite prejudice, you must 
<A NAME="1009"></A>do so at the close, so that the judges may more easily remember what you 
<A NAME="1010"></A>have said.
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR><BR>The appeal to the hearer aims at securing his goodwill, or at arousing 
<A NAME="1012"></A>his resentment, or sometimes at gaining his serious attention to the case, 
<A NAME="1013"></A>or even at distracting it-for gaining it is not always an advantage, and 
<A NAME="1014"></A>speakers will often for that reason try to make him 
<A NAME="1015"></A>laugh.
<A NAME="1016"></A><BR><BR>You may use any means you choose to make your hearer receptive; 
<A NAME="1017"></A>among others, giving him a good impression of your character, which always 
<A NAME="1018"></A>helps to secure his attention. He will be ready to attend to anything that 
<A NAME="1019"></A>touches himself and to anything that is important, surprising, or agreeable; 
<A NAME="1020"></A>and you should accordingly convey to him the impression that what you have 
<A NAME="1021"></A>to say is of this nature. If you wish to distract his attention, you should 
<A NAME="1022"></A>imply that the subject does not affect him, or is trivial or disagreeable. 
<A NAME="1023"></A>But observe, all this has nothing to do with the speech itself. It merely 
<A NAME="1024"></A>has to do with the weak-minded tendency of the hearer to listen to what 
<A NAME="1025"></A>is beside the point. Where this tendency is absent, no introduction wanted 
<A NAME="1026"></A>beyond a summary statement of your subject, to put a sort of head on the 
<A NAME="1027"></A>main body of your speech. Moreover, calls for attention, when required, 
<A NAME="1028"></A>may come equally well in any part of a speech; in fact, the beginning of 
<A NAME="1029"></A>it is just where there is least slackness of interest; it is therefore 
<A NAME="1030"></A>ridiculous to put this kind of thing at the beginning, when every one is 
<A NAME="1031"></A>listening with most attention. Choose therefore any point in the speech 
<A NAME="1032"></A>where such an appeal is needed, and then say 'Now I beg you to note this 
<A NAME="1033"></A>point-it concerns you quite as much as myself'; or <BR><BR>"I will tell 
<A NAME="1034"></A>you that whose like you have never yet "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1035"></A>heard for terror, or for wonder. This is what Prodicus called 'slipping 
<A NAME="1036"></A>in a bit of the fifty-drachma show-lecture for the audience whenever they 
<A NAME="1037"></A>began to nod'. It is plain that such introductions are addressed not to 
<A NAME="1038"></A>ideal hearers, but to hearers as we find them. The use of introductions 
<A NAME="1039"></A>to excite prejudice or to dispel misgivings is universal- <BR><BR>"My lord, 
<A NAME="1040"></A>I will not say that eagerly... "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1041"></A>or <BR><BR>"Why all this preface? "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1042"></A>Introductions are popular with those whose case is weak, or looks weak; 
<A NAME="1043"></A>it pays them to dwell on anything rather than the actual facts of it. That 
<A NAME="1044"></A>is why slaves, instead of answering the questions put to them, make indirect 
<A NAME="1045"></A>replies with long preambles. The means of exciting in your hearers goodwill 
<A NAME="1046"></A>and various other feelings of the same kind have already been described. 
<A NAME="1047"></A>The poet finely says May I find in Phaeacian hearts, at my coming, goodwill 
<A NAME="1048"></A>and compassion; and these are the two things we should aim at. In speeches 
<A NAME="1049"></A>of display we must make the hearer feel that the eulogy includes either 
<A NAME="1050"></A>himself or his family or his way of life or something or other of the kind. 
<A NAME="1051"></A>For it is true, as Socrates says in the Funeral Speech, that 'the difficulty 
<A NAME="1052"></A>is not to praise the Athenians at Athens but at Sparta'.
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR><BR>The introductions of political oratory will be made out of the 
<A NAME="1054"></A>same materials as those of the forensic kind, though the nature of political 
<A NAME="1055"></A>oratory makes them very rare. The subject is known already, and therefore 
<A NAME="1056"></A>the facts of the case need no introduction; but you may have to say something 
<A NAME="1057"></A>on account of yourself or to your opponents; or those present may be inclined 
<A NAME="1058"></A>to treat the matter either more or less seriously than you wish them to. 
<A NAME="1059"></A>You may accordingly have to excite or dispel some prejudice, or to make 
<A NAME="1060"></A>the matter under discussion seem more or less important than before: for 
<A NAME="1061"></A>either of which purposes you will want an introduction. You may also want 
<A NAME="1062"></A>one to add elegance to your remarks, feeling that otherwise they will have 
<A NAME="1063"></A>a casual air, like Gorgias' eulogy of the Eleans, in which, without any 
<A NAME="1064"></A>preliminary sparring or fencing, he begins straight off with 'Happy city 
<A NAME="1065"></A>of Elis!'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1066"></A><B>Part 15</B>

<A NAME="1067"></A><BR><BR>In dealing with prejudice, one class of argument is that whereby 
<A NAME="1068"></A>you can dispel objectionable suppositions about yourself. It makes no practical 
<A NAME="1069"></A>difference whether such a supposition has been put into words or not, so 
<A NAME="1070"></A>that this distinction may be ignored. Another way is to meet any of the 
<A NAME="1071"></A>issues directly: to deny the alleged fact; or to say that you have done 
<A NAME="1072"></A>no harm, or none to him, or not as much as he says; or that you have done 
<A NAME="1073"></A>him no injustice, or not much; or that you have done nothing disgraceful, 
<A NAME="1074"></A>or nothing disgraceful enough to matter: these are the sort of questions 
<A NAME="1075"></A>on which the dispute hinges. Thus Iphicrates replying to Nausicrates, admitted 
<A NAME="1076"></A>that he had done the deed alleged, and that he had done Nausicrates harm, 
<A NAME="1077"></A>but not that he had done him wrong. Or you may admit the wrong, but balance 
<A NAME="1078"></A>it with other facts, and say that, if the deed harmed him, at any rate 
<A NAME="1079"></A>it was honourable; or that, if it gave him pain, at least it did him good; 
<A NAME="1080"></A>or something else like that. Another way is to allege that your action 
<A NAME="1081"></A>was due to mistake, or bad luck, or necessity as Sophocles said he was 
<A NAME="1082"></A>not trembling, as his traducer maintained, in order to make people think 
<A NAME="1083"></A>him an old man, but because he could not help it; he would rather not be 
<A NAME="1084"></A>eighty years old. You may balance your motive against your actual deed; 
<A NAME="1085"></A>saying, for instance, that you did not mean to injure him but to do so-and-so; 
<A NAME="1086"></A>that you did not do what you are falsely charged with doing-the damage 
<A NAME="1087"></A>was accidental-'I should indeed be a detestable person if I had deliberately 
<A NAME="1088"></A>intended this result.' Another way is open when your calumniator, or any 
<A NAME="1089"></A>of his connexions, is or has been subject to the same grounds for suspicion. 
<A NAME="1090"></A>Yet another, when others are subject to the same grounds for suspicion 
<A NAME="1091"></A>but are admitted to be in fact innocent of the charge: e.g. 'Must I be 
<A NAME="1092"></A>a profligate because I am well-groomed? Then so-and-so must be one too.' 
<A NAME="1093"></A>Another, if other people have been calumniated by the same man or some 
<A NAME="1094"></A>one else, or, without being calumniated, have been suspected, like yourself 
<A NAME="1095"></A>now, and yet have been proved innocent. Another way is to return calumny 
<A NAME="1096"></A>for calumny and say, 'It is monstrous to trust the man's statements when 
<A NAME="1097"></A>you cannot trust the man himself.' Another is when the question has been 
<A NAME="1098"></A>already decided. So with Euripides' reply to Hygiaenon, who, in the action 
<A NAME="1099"></A>for an exchange of properties, accused him of impiety in having written 
<A NAME="1100"></A>a line encouraging perjury- <BR><BR>"My tongue hath sworn: no oath is on 
<A NAME="1101"></A>my soul. "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1102"></A>Euripides said that his opponent himself was guilty in bringing into the 
<A NAME="1103"></A>law-courts cases whose decision belonged to the Dionysiac contests. 'If 
<A NAME="1104"></A>I have not already answered for my words there, I am ready to do so if 
<A NAME="1105"></A>you choose to prosecute me there.' Another method is to denounce calumny, 
<A NAME="1106"></A>showing what an enormity it is, and in particular that it raises false
