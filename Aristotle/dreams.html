<BR><BR>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>

<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>We must, in the next place, investigate the subject of the dream, and first 
<A NAME="12"></A>inquire to which of the faculties of the soul it presents itself, i.e. 
<A NAME="13"></A>whether the affection is one which pertains to the faculty of intelligence 
<A NAME="14"></A>or to that of sense-perception; for these are the only faculties within 
<A NAME="15"></A>us by which we acquire knowledge.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>If, then, the exercise of the faculty of sight is actual seeing, 
<A NAME="17"></A>that of the auditory faculty, hearing, and, in general that of the faculty 
<A NAME="18"></A>of sense-perception, perceiving; and if there are some perceptions common 
<A NAME="19"></A>to the senses, such as figure, magnitude, motion, &c., while there are 
<A NAME="20"></A>others, as colour, sound, taste, peculiar [each to its own sense]; and 
<A NAME="21"></A>further, if all creatures, when the eyes are closed in sleep, are unable 
<A NAME="22"></A>to see, and the analogous statement is true of the other senses, so that 
<A NAME="23"></A>manifestly we perceive nothing when asleep; we may conclude that it is 
<A NAME="24"></A>not by sense-perception we perceive a dream.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>But neither is it by opinion that we do so. For [in dreams] we 
<A NAME="26"></A>not only assert, e.g. that some object approaching is a man or a horse 
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><I>which would be an exercise of opinion</I>
<A NAME="28"></A>, but that the object iswhite or beautiful, points on which opinion without 
<A NAME="29"></A>sense-perception asserts nothing either truly or falsely. It is, however, 
<A NAME="30"></A>a fact that the soul makes such assertions in sleep. We seem to see equally 
<A NAME="31"></A>well that the approaching figure is a man, and that it is white. [In dreams], 
<A NAME="32"></A>too, we think something else, over and above the dream presentation, just 
<A NAME="33"></A>as we do in waking moments when we perceive something; for we often also 
<A NAME="34"></A>reason about that which we perceive. So, too, in sleep we sometimes have 
<A NAME="35"></A>thoughts other than the mere phantasms immediately before our minds. This 
<A NAME="36"></A>would be manifest to any one who should attend and try, immediately on 
<A NAME="37"></A>arising from sleep, to remember [his dreaming experience]. There are cases 
<A NAME="38"></A>of persons who have seen such dreams, those, for example, who believe themselves 
<A NAME="39"></A>to be mentally arranging a given list of subjects according to the mnemonic 
<A NAME="40"></A>rule. They frequently find themselves engaged in something else besides 
<A NAME="41"></A>the dream, viz. in setting a phantasm which they envisage into its mnemonic 
<A NAME="42"></A>position. Hence it is plain that not every 'phantasm' in sleep is a mere 
<A NAME="43"></A>dream-image, and that the further thinking which we perform then is due 
<A NAME="44"></A>to an exercise of the faculty of opinion.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>So much at least is plain on all these points, viz. that the faculty 
<A NAME="46"></A>by which, in waking hours, we are subject to illusion when affected by 
<A NAME="47"></A>disease, is identical with that which produces illusory effects in sleep. 
<A NAME="48"></A>So, even when persons are in excellent health, and know the facts of the 
<A NAME="49"></A>case perfectly well, the sun, nevertheless, appears to them to be only 
<A NAME="50"></A>a foot wide. Now, whether the presentative faculty of the soul be identical 
<A NAME="51"></A>with, or different from, the faculty of sense-perception, in either case 
<A NAME="52"></A>the illusion does not occur without our actually seeing or [otherwise] 
<A NAME="53"></A>perceiving something. Even to see wrongly or to hear wrongly can happen 
<A NAME="54"></A>only to one who sees or hears something real, though not exactly what he 
<A NAME="55"></A>supposes. But we have assumed that in sleep one neither sees, nor hears, 
<A NAME="56"></A>nor exercises any sense whatever. Perhaps we may regard it as true that 
<A NAME="57"></A>the dreamer sees nothing, yet as false that his faculty of sense-perception 
<A NAME="58"></A>is unaffected, the fact being that the sense of seeing and the other senses 
<A NAME="59"></A>may possibly be then in a certain way affected, while each of these affections, 
<A NAME="60"></A>as duly as when he is awake, gives its impulse in a certain manner to his 
<A NAME="61"></A>[primary] faculty of sense, though not in precisely the same manner as 
<A NAME="62"></A>when he is awake. Sometimes, too, opinion says [to dreamers] just as to 
<A NAME="63"></A>those who are awake, that the object seen is an illusion; at other times 
<A NAME="64"></A>it is inhibited, and becomes a mere follower of the 
<A NAME="65"></A>phantasm.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>It is plain therefore that this affection, which we name 'dreaming', 
<A NAME="67"></A>is no mere exercise of opinion or intelligence, but yet is not an affection 
<A NAME="68"></A>of the faculty of perception in the simple sense. If it were the latter 
<A NAME="69"></A>it would be possible [when asleep] to hear and see in the simple 
<A NAME="70"></A>sense.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>How then, and in what manner, it takes place, is what we have to 
<A NAME="72"></A>examine. Let us assume, what is indeed clear enough, that the affection 
<A NAME="73"></A>[of dreaming] pertains to sense-perception as surely as sleep itself does. 
<A NAME="74"></A>For sleep does not pertain to one organ in animals and dreaming to another; 
<A NAME="75"></A>both pertain to the same organ.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>But since we have, in our work On the Soul, treated of presentation, 
<A NAME="77"></A>and the faculty of presentation is identical with that of sense-perception, 
<A NAME="78"></A>though the essential notion of a faculty of presentation is different from 
<A NAME="79"></A>that of a faculty of sense-perception; and since presentation is the movement 
<A NAME="80"></A>set up by a sensory faculty when actually discharging its function, while 
<A NAME="81"></A>a dream appears to be a presentation (for a presentation which occurs in 
<A NAME="82"></A>sleep-whether simply or in some particular way-is what we call a dream): 
<A NAME="83"></A>it manifestly follows that dreaming is an activity of the faculty of sense-perception, 
<A NAME="84"></A>but belongs to this faculty qua presentative.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="85"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>We can best obtain a scientific view of the nature of the dream 
<A NAME="87"></A>and the manner in which it originates by regarding it in the light of the 
<A NAME="88"></A>circumstances attending sleep. The objects of sense-perception corresponding 
<A NAME="89"></A>to each sensory organ produce sense-perception in us, and the affection 
<A NAME="90"></A>due to their operation is present in the organs of sense not only when 
<A NAME="91"></A>the perceptions are actualized, but even when they have 
<A NAME="92"></A>departed.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>What happens in these cases may be compared with what happens in 
<A NAME="94"></A>the case of projectiles moving in space. For in the case of these the movement 
<A NAME="95"></A>continues even when that which set up the movement is no longer in contact 
<A NAME="96"></A>[with the things that are moved]. For that which set them in motion moves 
<A NAME="97"></A>a certain portion of air, and this, in turn, being moved excites motion 
<A NAME="98"></A>in another portion; and so, accordingly, it is in this way that [the bodies], 
<A NAME="99"></A>whether in air or in liquids, continue moving, until they come to a 
<A NAME="100"></A>standstill.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>This we must likewise assume to happen in the case of qualitative 
<A NAME="102"></A>change; for that part which [for example] has been heated by something 
<A NAME="103"></A>hot, heats [in turn] the part next to it, and this propagates the affection 
<A NAME="104"></A>continuously onwards until the process has come round to its oint of origination. 
<A NAME="105"></A>This must also happen in the organ wherein the exercise of sense-perception 
<A NAME="106"></A>takes place, since sense-perception, as realized in actual perceiving, 
<A NAME="107"></A>is a mode of qualitative change. This explains why the affection continues 
<A NAME="108"></A>in the sensory organs, both in their deeper and in their more superficial 
<A NAME="109"></A>parts, not merely while they are actually engaged in perceiving, but even 
<A NAME="110"></A>after they have ceased to do so. That they do this, indeed, is obvious 
<A NAME="111"></A>in cases where we continue for some time engaged in a particular form of 
<A NAME="112"></A>perception, for then, when we shift the scene of our perceptive activity, 
<A NAME="113"></A>the previous affection remains; for instance, when we have turned our gaze 
<A NAME="114"></A>from sunlight into darkness. For the result of this is that one sees nothing, 
<A NAME="115"></A>owing to the excited by the light still subsisting in our eyes. Also, when 
<A NAME="116"></A>we have looked steadily for a long while at one colour, e.g. at white or 
<A NAME="117"></A>green, that to which we next transfer our gaze appears to be of the same 
<A NAME="118"></A>colour. Again if, after having looked at the sun or some other brilliant 
<A NAME="119"></A>object, we close the eyes, then, if we watch carefully, it appears in a 
<A NAME="120"></A>right line with the direction of vision (whatever this may be), at first 
<A NAME="121"></A>in its own colour; then it changes to crimson, next to purple, until it 
<A NAME="122"></A>becomes black and disappears. And also when persons turn away from looking 
<A NAME="123"></A>at objects in motion, e.g. rivers, and especially those which flow very 
<A NAME="124"></A>rapidly, they find that the visual stimulations still present themselves, 
<A NAME="125"></A>for the things really at rest are then seen moving: persons become very 
<A NAME="126"></A>deaf after hearing loud noises, and after smelling very strong odours their 
<A NAME="127"></A>power of smelling is impaired; and similarly in other cases. These phenomena 
<A NAME="128"></A>manifestly take place in the way above described.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>That the sensory organs are acutely sensitive to even a slight 
<A NAME="130"></A>qualitative difference [in their objects] is shown by what happens in the 
<A NAME="131"></A>case of mirrors; a subject to which, even taking it independently, one 
<A NAME="132"></A>might devote close consideration and inquiry. At the same time it becomes 
<A NAME="133"></A>plain from them that as the eye [in seeing] is affected [by the object 
<A NAME="134"></A>seen], so also it produces a certain effect upon it. If a woman chances 
<A NAME="135"></A>during her menstrual period to look into a highly polished mirror, the 
<A NAME="136"></A>surface of it will grow cloudy with a blood-coloured haze. It is very hard 
<A NAME="137"></A>to remove this stain from a new mirror, but easier to remove from an older 
<A NAME="138"></A>mirror. As we have said before, the cause of this lies in the fact that 
<A NAME="139"></A>in the act of sight there occurs not only a passion in the sense organ 
<A NAME="140"></A>acted on by the polished surface, but the organ, as an agent, also produces 
<A NAME="141"></A>an action, as is proper to a brilliant object. For sight is the property 
<A NAME="142"></A>of an organ possessing brilliance and colour. The eyes, therefore, have 
<A NAME="143"></A>their proper action as have other parts of the body. Because it is natural 
<A NAME="144"></A>to the eye to be filled with blood-vessels, a woman's eyes, during the 
<A NAME="145"></A>period of menstrual flux and inflammation, will undergo a change, although 
<A NAME="146"></A>her husband will not note this since his seed is of the same nature as 
<A NAME="147"></A>that of his wife. The surrounding atmosphere, through which operates the 
<A NAME="148"></A>action of sight, and which surrounds the mirror also, will undergo a change 
<A NAME="149"></A>of the same sort that occurred shortly before in the woman's eyes, and 
<A NAME="150"></A>hence the surface of the mirror is likewise affected. And as in the case 
<A NAME="151"></A>of a garment, the cleaner it is the more quickly it is soiled, so the same 
<A NAME="152"></A>holds true in the case of the mirror. For anything that is clean will show 
<A NAME="153"></A>quite clearly a stain that it chances to receive, and the cleanest object 
<A NAME="154"></A>shows up even the slightest stain. A bronze mirror, because of its shininess, 
<A NAME="155"></A>is especially sensitive to any sort of contact (the movement of the surrounding 
<A NAME="156"></A>air acts upon it like a rubbing or pressing or wiping); on that account, 
<A NAME="157"></A>therefore, what is clean will show up clearly the slightest touch on its 
<A NAME="158"></A>surface. It is hard to cleanse smudges off new mirrors because the stain 
<A NAME="159"></A>penetrates deeply and is suffused to all parts; it penetrates deeply because 
<A NAME="160"></A>the mirror is not a dense medium, and is suffused widely because of the 
<A NAME="161"></A>smoothness of the object. On the other hand, in the case of old mirrors, 
<A NAME="162"></A>stains do not remain because they do not penetrate deeply, but only smudge 
<A NAME="163"></A>the surface.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>From this therefore it is plain that stimulatory motion is set 
<A NAME="165"></A>up even by slight differences, and that sense-perception is quick to respond 
<A NAME="166"></A>to it; and further that the organ which perceives colour is not only affected 
<A NAME="167"></A>by its object, but also reacts upon it. Further evidence to the same point 
<A NAME="168"></A>is afforded by what takes place in wines, and in the manufacture of unguents. 
<A NAME="169"></A>For both oil, when prepared, and wine become rapidly infected by the odours 
<A NAME="170"></A>of the things near them; they not only acquire the odours of the things 
<A NAME="171"></A>thrown into or mixed with them, but also those of the things which are 
<A NAME="172"></A>placed, or which grow, near the vessels containing them.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>In order to answer our original question, let us now, therefore, 
<A NAME="174"></A>assume one proposition, which is clear from what precedes, viz. that even 
<A NAME="175"></A>when the external object of perception has departed, the impressions it 
<A NAME="176"></A>has made persist, and are themselves objects of perception: and [let us 
<A NAME="177"></A>assume], besides, that we are easily deceived respecting the operations 
<A NAME="178"></A>of sense-perception when we are excited by emotions, and different persons 
<A NAME="179"></A>according to their different emotions; for example, the coward when excited 
<A NAME="180"></A>by fear, the amorous person by amorous desire; so that, with but little 
<A NAME="181"></A>resemblance to go upon, the former thinks he sees his foes approaching, 
<A NAME="182"></A>the latter, that he sees the object of his desire; and the more deeply 
<A NAME="183"></A>one is under the influence of the emotion, the less similarity is required 
<A NAME="184"></A>to give rise to these illusory impressions. Thus too, both in fits of anger, 
<A NAME="185"></A>and also in all states of appetite, all men become easily deceived, and 
<A NAME="186"></A>more so the more their emotions are excited. This is the reason too why 
<A NAME="187"></A>persons in the delirium of fever sometimes think they see animals on their 
<A NAME="188"></A>chamber walls, an illusion arising from the faint resemblance to animals 
<A NAME="189"></A>of the markings thereon when put together in patterns; and this sometimes 
<A NAME="190"></A>corresponds with the emotional states of the sufferers, in such a way that, 
<A NAME="191"></A>if the latter be not very ill, they know well enough that it is an illusion; 
<A NAME="192"></A>but if the illness is more severe they actually move according to the appearances. 
<A NAME="193"></A>The cause of these occurrences is that the faculty in virtue of which the 
<A NAME="194"></A>controlling sense judges is not identical with that in virtue of which 
<A NAME="195"></A>presentations come before the mind. A proof of this is, that the sun presents 
<A NAME="196"></A>itself as only a foot in diameter, though often something else gainsays 
<A NAME="197"></A>the presentation. Again, when the fingers are crossed, the one object <BR><I>placed 
<A NAME="198"></A>between them</I>
<A NAME="199"></A>is felt [by the touch] as two; but yet we denythat it is two; for sight 
<A NAME="200"></A>is more authoritative than touch. Yet, if touch stood alone, we should 
<A NAME="201"></A>actually have pronounced the one object to be two. The ground of such false 
<A NAME="202"></A>judgements is that any appearances whatever present themselves, not only 
<A NAME="203"></A>when its object stimulates a sense, but also when the sense by itself alone 
<A NAME="204"></A>is stimulated, provided only it be stimulated in the same manner as it 
<A NAME="205"></A>is by the object. For example, to persons sailing past the land seems to 
<A NAME="206"></A>move, when it is really the eye that is being moved by something else [the 
<A NAME="207"></A>moving ship.]
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="208"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>From this it is manifest that the stimulatory movements based upon 
<A NAME="210"></A>sensory impressions, whether the latter are derived from external objects 
<A NAME="211"></A>or from causes within the body, present themselves not only when persons 
<A NAME="212"></A>are awake, but also then, when this affection which is called sleep has 
<A NAME="213"></A>come upon them, with even greater impressiveness. For by day, while the 
<A NAME="214"></A>senses and the intellect are working together, they (i.e. such movements) 
<A NAME="215"></A>are extruded from consciousness or obscured, just as a smaller is beside 
<A NAME="216"></A>a larger fire, or as small beside great pains or pleasures, though, as 
<A NAME="217"></A>soon as the latter have ceased, even those which are trifling emerge into 
<A NAME="218"></A>notice. But by night <BR><I>i.e. in sleep</I>
<A NAME="219"></A>owing to the inaction of the particular senses, andtheir powerlessness 
<A NAME="220"></A>to realize themselves, which arises from the reflux of the hot from the 
<A NAME="221"></A>exterior parts to the interior, they <BR><I>i.e. the above 
<A NAME="222"></A>'movements'</I>
<A NAME="223"></A>are borne in to the head quarters ofsense-perception, and there display 
<A NAME="224"></A>themselves as the disturbance (of waking life) subsides. We must suppose 
<A NAME="225"></A>that, like the little eddies which are being ever formed in rivers, so 
<A NAME="226"></A>the sensory movements are each a continuous process, often remaining like 
<A NAME="227"></A>what they were when first started, but often, too, broken into other forms 
<A NAME="228"></A>by collisions with obstacles. This [last mentioned point], moreover, gives 
<A NAME="229"></A>the reason why no dreams occur in sleep immediately after meals, or to 
<A NAME="230"></A>sleepers who are extremely young, e.g. to infants. The internal movement 
<A NAME="231"></A>in such cases is excessive, owing to the heat generated from the food. 
<A NAME="232"></A>Hence, just as in a liquid, if one vehemently disturbs it, sometimes no 
<A NAME="233"></A>reflected image appears, while at other times one appears, indeed, but 
<A NAME="234"></A>utterly distorted, so as to seem quite unlike its original; while, when 
<A NAME="235"></A>once the motion has ceased, the reflected images are clear and plain; in 
<A NAME="236"></A>the same manner during sleep the phantasms, or residuary movements, which 
<A NAME="237"></A>are based upon the sensory impressions, become sometimes quite obliterated 
<A NAME="238"></A>by the above described motion when too violent; while at other times the 
<A NAME="239"></A>sights are indeed seen, but confused and weird, and the dreams <BR><I>which 
<A NAME="240"></A>then appear</I>
<A NAME="241"></A>are unhealthy, like those of persons who areatrabilious, or feverish, or 
<A NAME="242"></A>intoxicated with wine. For all such affections, being spirituous, cause 
<A NAME="243"></A>much commotion and disturbance. In sanguineous animals, in proportion as 
<A NAME="244"></A>the blood becomes calm, and as its purer are separated from its less pure 
<A NAME="245"></A>elements, the fact that the movement, based on impressions derived from 
<A NAME="246"></A>each of the organs of sense, is preserved in its integrity, renders the 
<A NAME="247"></A>dreams healthy, causes a [clear] image to present itself, and makes the 
<A NAME="248"></A>dreamer think, owing to the effects borne in from the organ of sight, that 
<A NAME="249"></A>he actually sees, and owing to those which come from the organ of hearing, 
<A NAME="250"></A>that he really hears; and so on with those also which proceed from the 
<A NAME="251"></A>other sensory organs. For it is owing to the fact that the movement which 
<A NAME="252"></A>reaches the primary organ of sense comes from them, that one even when 
<A NAME="253"></A>awake believes himself to see, or hear, or otherwise perceive; just as 
<A NAME="254"></A>it is from a belief that the organ of sight is being stimulated, though 
<A NAME="255"></A>in reality not so stimulated, that we sometimes erroneously declare ourselves 
<A NAME="256"></A>to see, or that, from the fact that touch announces two movements, we think 
<A NAME="257"></A>that the one object is two. For, as a rule, the governing sense affirms 
<A NAME="258"></A>the report of each particular sense, unless another particular sense, more 
<A NAME="259"></A>authoritative, makes a contradictory report. In every case an appearance 
<A NAME="260"></A>presents itself, but what appears does not in every case seem real, unless 
<A NAME="261"></A>when the deciding faculty is inhibited, or does not move with its proper 
<A NAME="262"></A>motion. Moreover, as we said that different men are subject to illusions, 
<A NAME="263"></A>each according to the different emotion present in him, so it is that the 
<A NAME="264"></A>sleeper, owing to sleep, and to the movements then going on in his sensory 
<A NAME="265"></A>organs, as well as to the other facts of the sensory process, [is liable 
<A NAME="266"></A>to illusion], so that the dream presentation, though but little like it, 
<A NAME="267"></A>appears as some actual given thing. For when one is asleep, in proportion 
<A NAME="268"></A>as most of the blood sinks inwards to its fountain [the heart], the internal 
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><I>sensory</I>
<A NAME="270"></A>movements, some potential, others actual accompany itinwards. They are 
<A NAME="271"></A>so related [in general] that, if anything move the blood, some one sensory 
<A NAME="272"></A>movement will emerge from it, while if this perishes another will take 
<A NAME="273"></A>its place; while to one another also they are related in the same way as 
<A NAME="274"></A>the artificial frogs in water which severally rise [in fixed succesion] 
<A NAME="275"></A>to the surface in the order in which the salt [which keeps them down] becomes 
<A NAME="276"></A>dissolved. The residuary movements are like these: they are within the 
<A NAME="277"></A>soul potentially, but actualize themselves only when the impediment to 
<A NAME="278"></A>their doing so has been relaxed; and according as they are thus set free, 
<A NAME="279"></A>they begin to move in the blood which remains in the sensory organs, and 
<A NAME="280"></A>which is now but scanty, while they possess verisimilitude after the manner 
<A NAME="281"></A>of cloud-shapes, which in their rapid metamorphoses one compares now to 
<A NAME="282"></A>human beings and a moment afterwards to centaurs. Each of them is however, 
<A NAME="283"></A>as has been said, the remnant of a sensory impression taken when sense 
<A NAME="284"></A>was actualizing itself; and when this, the true impression, has departed, 
<A NAME="285"></A>its remnant is still immanent, and it is correct to say of it, that though 
<A NAME="286"></A>not actually Koriskos, it is like Koriskos. For when the person was actually 
<A NAME="287"></A>perceiving, his controlling and judging sensory faculty did not call it 
<A NAME="288"></A>Koriskos, but, prompted by this [impression], called the genuine person 
<A NAME="289"></A>yonder Koriskos. Accordingly, this sensory impulse, which, when actually 
<A NAME="290"></A>perceiving, it [the controlling faculty] describes (unless completely inhibited 
<A NAME="291"></A>by the blood), it now [in dreams] when quasi-perceiving, receives from 
<A NAME="292"></A>the movements persisting in the sense-organs, and mistakes it-an impulse 
<A NAME="293"></A>that is merely like the true [objective] impression-for the true impression 
<A NAME="294"></A>itself, while the effect of sleep is so great that it causes this mistake 
<A NAME="295"></A>to pass unnoticed. Accordingly, just as if a finger be inserted beneath 
<A NAME="296"></A>the eyeball without being observed, one object will not only present two 
<A NAME="297"></A>visual images, but will create an opinion of its being two objects; while 
<A NAME="298"></A>if it [the finger] be observed, the presentation will be the same, but 
<A NAME="299"></A>the same opinion will not be formed of it; exactly so it is in states of 
<A NAME="300"></A>sleep: if the sleeper perceives that he is asleep, and is conscious of 
<A NAME="301"></A>the sleeping state during which the perception comes before his mind, it 
<A NAME="302"></A>presents itself still, but something within him speaks to this effect: 
<A NAME="303"></A>'the image of Koriskos presents itself, but the real Koriskos is not present'; 
<A NAME="304"></A>for often, when one is asleep, there is something in consciousness which 
<A NAME="305"></A>declares that what then presents itself is but a dream. If, however, he 
<A NAME="306"></A>is not aware of being asleep, there is nothing which will contradict the 
<A NAME="307"></A>testimony of the bare presentation.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>That what we here urge is true, i.e. that there are such presentative 
<A NAME="309"></A>movements in the sensory organs, any one may convince himself, if he attends 
<A NAME="310"></A>to and tries to remember the affections we experience when sinking into 
<A NAME="311"></A>slumber or when being awakened. He will sometimes, in the moment of awakening, 
<A NAME="312"></A>surprise the images which present themselves to him in sleep, and find 
<A NAME="313"></A>that they are really but movements lurking in the organs of sense. And 
<A NAME="314"></A>indeed some very young persons, if it is dark, though looking with wide 
<A NAME="315"></A>open eyes, see multitudes of phantom figures moving before them, so that 
<A NAME="316"></A>they often cover up their heads in terror.
<A NAME="317"></A><BR><BR>From all this, then, the conclusion to be drawn is, that the dream 
<A NAME="318"></A>is a sort of presentation, and, more particularly, one which occurs in 
<A NAME="319"></A>sleep; since the phantoms just mentioned are not dreams, nor is any other 
<A NAME="320"></A>a dream which presents itself when the sense-perceptions are in a state 
<A NAME="321"></A>of freedom. Nor is every presentation which occurs in sleep necessarily 
<A NAME="322"></A>a dream. For in the first place, some persons [when asleep] actually, in 
<A NAME="323"></A>a certain way, perceive sounds, light, savour, and contact; feebly, however, 
<A NAME="324"></A>and, as it were, remotely. For there have been cases in which persons while 
<A NAME="325"></A>asleep, but with the eyes partly open, saw faintly in their sleep (as they 
<A NAME="326"></A>supposed) the light of a lamp, and afterwards, on being awakened, straightway 
<A NAME="327"></A>recognized it as the actual light of a real lamp; while, in other cases, 
<A NAME="328"></A>persons who faintly heard the crowing of cocks or the barking of dogs identified 
<A NAME="329"></A>these clearly with the real sounds as soon as they awoke. Some persons, 
<A NAME="330"></A>too, return answers to questions put to them in sleep. For it is quite 
<A NAME="331"></A>possible that, of waking or sleeping, while the one is present in the ordinary 
<A NAME="332"></A>sense, the other also should be present in a certain way. But none of these 
<A NAME="333"></A>occurrences should be called a dream. Nor should the true thoughts, as 
<A NAME="334"></A>distinct from the mere presentations, which occur in sleep [be called dreams]. 
<A NAME="335"></A>The dream proper is a presentation based on the movement of sense impressions, 
<A NAME="336"></A>when such presentation occurs during sleep, taking sleep in the strict 
<A NAME="337"></A>sense of the term.
<A NAME="338"></A><BR><BR>There are cases of persons who in their whole lives have never 
<A NAME="339"></A>had a dream, while others dream when considerably advanced in years, having 
<A NAME="340"></A>never dreamed before. The cause of their not having dreams appears somewhat 
<A NAME="341"></A>like that which operates in the case of infants, and <BR><I>that which 
<A NAME="342"></A>operates</I>
<A NAME="343"></A>immediately after meals. It is intelligibleenough that no dream-presentation 
<A NAME="344"></A>should occur to persons whose natural constitution is such that in them 
<A NAME="345"></A>copious evaporation is borne upwards, which, when borne back downwards, 
<A NAME="346"></A>causes a large quantity of motion. But it is not surprising that, as age 
<A NAME="347"></A>advances, a dream should at length appear to them. Indeed, it is inevitable 
<A NAME="348"></A>that, as a change is wrought in them in proportion to age or emotional 
<A NAME="349"></A>experience, this reversal [from non-dreaming to dreaming] should occur 
<A NAME="350"></A>also.
