<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>1
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Let us now make a fresh beginning and point out that of moral states 
<A NAME="12"></A>to be avoided there are three kinds-vice, incontinence, brutishness. The 
<A NAME="13"></A>contraries of two of these are evident,-one we call virtue, the other continence; 
<A NAME="14"></A>to brutishness it would be most fitting to oppose superhuman virtue, a 
<A NAME="15"></A>heroic and divine kind of virtue, as Homer has represented Priam saying 
<A NAME="16"></A>of Hector that he was very good,
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>For he seemed not, he,
<A NAME="18"></A><BR>The child of a mortal man, but as one that of God's seed 
<A NAME="19"></A>came.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>Therefore if, as they say, men become gods by excess of virtue, 
<A NAME="21"></A>of this kind must evidently be the state opposed to the brutish state; 
<A NAME="22"></A>for as a brute has no vice or virtue, so neither has a god; his state is 
<A NAME="23"></A>higher than virtue, and that of a brute is a different kind of state from 
<A NAME="24"></A>vice.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>Now, since it is rarely that a godlike man is found-to use the 
<A NAME="26"></A>epithet of the Spartans, who when they admire any one highly call him a 
<A NAME="27"></A>'godlike man'-so too the brutish type is rarely found among men; it is 
<A NAME="28"></A>found chiefly among barbarians, but some brutish qualities are also produced 
<A NAME="29"></A>by disease or deformity; and we also call by this evil name those men who 
<A NAME="30"></A>go beyond all ordinary standards by reason of vice. Of this kind of disposition, 
<A NAME="31"></A>however, we must later make some mention, while we have discussed vice 
<A NAME="32"></A>before we must now discuss incontinence and softness (or effeminacy), and 
<A NAME="33"></A>continence and endurance; for we must treat each of the two neither as 
<A NAME="34"></A>identical with virtue or wickedness, nor as a different genus. We must, 
<A NAME="35"></A>as in all other cases, set the observed facts before us and, after first 
<A NAME="36"></A>discussing the difficulties, go on to prove, if possible, the truth of 
<A NAME="37"></A>all the common opinions about these affections of the mind, or, failing 
<A NAME="38"></A>this, of the greater number and the most authoritative; for if we both 
<A NAME="39"></A>refute the objections and leave the common opinions undisturbed, we shall 
<A NAME="40"></A>have proved the case sufficiently.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>Now (1) both continence and endurance are thought to be included 
<A NAME="42"></A>among things good and praiseworthy, and both incontinence and soft, ness 
<A NAME="43"></A>among things bad and blameworthy; and the same man is thought to be continent 
<A NAME="44"></A>and ready to abide by the result of his calculations, or incontinent and 
<A NAME="45"></A>ready to abandon them. And (2) the incontinent man, knowing that what he 
<A NAME="46"></A>does is bad, does it as a result of passion, while the continent man, knowing 
<A NAME="47"></A>that his appetites are bad, refuses on account of his rational principle 
<A NAME="48"></A>to follow them (3) The temperate man all men call continent and disposed 
<A NAME="49"></A>to endurance, while the continent man some maintain to be always temperate 
<A NAME="50"></A>but others do not; and some call the self-indulgent man incontinent and 
<A NAME="51"></A>the incontinent man selfindulgent indiscriminately, while others distinguish 
<A NAME="52"></A>them. (4) The man of practical wisdom, they sometimes say, cannot be incontinent, 
<A NAME="53"></A>while sometimes they say that some who are practically wise and clever 
<A NAME="54"></A>are incontinent. Again (5) men are said to be incontinent even with respect 
<A NAME="55"></A>to anger, honour, and gain.-These, then, are the things that are 
<A NAME="56"></A>said.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>2
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>Now we may ask (1) how a man who judges rightly can behave incontinently. 
<A NAME="59"></A>That he should behave so when he has knowledge, some say is impossible; 
<A NAME="60"></A>for it would be strange-so Socrates thought-if when knowledge was in a 
<A NAME="61"></A>man something else could master it and drag it about like a slave. For 
<A NAME="62"></A>Socrates was entirely opposed to the view in question, holding that there 
<A NAME="63"></A>is no such thing as incontinence; no one, he said, when he judges acts 
<A NAME="64"></A>against what he judges best-people act so only by reason of ignorance. 
<A NAME="65"></A>Now this view plainly contradicts the observed facts, and we must inquire 
<A NAME="66"></A>about what happens to such a man; if he acts by reason of ignorance, what 
<A NAME="67"></A>is the manner of his ignorance? For that the man who behaves incontinently 
<A NAME="68"></A>does not, before he gets into this state, think he ought to act so, is 
<A NAME="69"></A>evident. But there are some who concede certain of Socrates' contentions 
<A NAME="70"></A>but not others; that nothing is stronger than knowledge they admit, but 
<A NAME="71"></A>not that on one acts contrary to what has seemed to him the better course, 
<A NAME="72"></A>and therefore they say that the incontinent man has not knowledge when 
<A NAME="73"></A>he is mastered by his pleasures, but opinion. But if it is opinion and 
<A NAME="74"></A>not knowledge, if it is not a strong conviction that resists but a weak 
<A NAME="75"></A>one, as in men who hesitate, we sympathize with their failure to stand 
<A NAME="76"></A>by such convictions against strong appetites; but we do not sympathize 
<A NAME="77"></A>with wickedness, nor with any of the other blameworthy states. Is it then 
<A NAME="78"></A>practical wisdom whose resistance is mastered? That is the strongest of 
<A NAME="79"></A>all states. But this is absurd; the same man will be at once practically 
<A NAME="80"></A>wise and incontinent, but no one would say that it is the part of a practically 
<A NAME="81"></A>wise man to do willingly the basest acts. Besides, it has been shown before 
<A NAME="82"></A>that the man of practical wisdom is one who will act (for he is a man concerned 
<A NAME="83"></A>with the individual facts) and who has the other virtues.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>(2) Further, if continence involves having strong and bad appetites, 
<A NAME="85"></A>the temperate man will not be continent nor the continent man temperate; 
<A NAME="86"></A>for a temperate man will have neither excessive nor bad appetites. But 
<A NAME="87"></A>the continent man must; for if the appetites are good, the state of character 
<A NAME="88"></A>that restrains us from following them is bad, so that not all continence 
<A NAME="89"></A>will be good; while if they are weak and not bad, there is nothing admirable 
<A NAME="90"></A>in resisting them, and if they are weak and bad, there is nothing great 
<A NAME="91"></A>in resisting these either.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>(3) Further, if continence makes a man ready to stand by any and 
<A NAME="93"></A>every opinion, it is bad, i.e. if it makes him stand even by a false opinion; 
<A NAME="94"></A>and if incontinence makes a man apt to abandon any and every opinion, there 
<A NAME="95"></A>will be a good incontinence, of which Sophocles' Neoptolemus in the Philoctetes 
<A NAME="96"></A>will be an instance; for he is to be praised for not standing by what Odysseus 
<A NAME="97"></A>persuaded him to do, because he is pained at telling a 
<A NAME="98"></A>lie.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>(4) Further, the sophistic argument presents a difficulty; the 
<A NAME="100"></A>syllogism arising from men's wish to expose paradoxical results arising 
<A NAME="101"></A>from an opponent's view, in order that they may be admired when they succeed, 
<A NAME="102"></A>is one that puts us in a difficulty (for thought is bound fast when it 
<A NAME="103"></A>will not rest because the conclusion does not satisfy it, and cannot advance 
<A NAME="104"></A>because it cannot refute the argument). There is an argument from which 
<A NAME="105"></A>it follows that folly coupled with incontinence is virtue; for a man does 
<A NAME="106"></A>the opposite of what he judges, owing to incontinence, but judges what 
<A NAME="107"></A>is good to be evil and something that he should not do, and consequence 
<A NAME="108"></A>he will do what is good and not what is evil.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>(5) Further, he who on conviction does and pursues and chooses 
<A NAME="110"></A>what is pleasant would be thought to be better than one who does so as 
<A NAME="111"></A>a result not of calculation but of incontinence; for he is easier to cure 
<A NAME="112"></A>since he may be persuaded to change his mind. But to the incontinent man 
<A NAME="113"></A>may be applied the proverb 'when water chokes, what is one to wash it down 
<A NAME="114"></A>with?' If he had been persuaded of the rightness of what he does, he would 
<A NAME="115"></A>have desisted when he was persuaded to change his mind; but now he acts 
<A NAME="116"></A>in spite of his being persuaded of something quite different.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>(6) Further, if incontinence and continence are concerned with 
<A NAME="118"></A>any and every kind of object, who is it that is incontinent in the unqualified 
<A NAME="119"></A>sense? No one has all the forms of incontinence, but we say some people 
<A NAME="120"></A>are incontinent without qualification.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>3
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>Of some such kind are the difficulties that arise; some of these 
<A NAME="123"></A>points must be refuted and the others left in possession of the field; 
<A NAME="124"></A>for the solution of the difficulty is the discovery of the truth. (1) We 
<A NAME="125"></A>must consider first, then, whether incontinent people act knowingly or 
<A NAME="126"></A>not, and in what sense knowingly; then (2) with what sorts of object the 
<A NAME="127"></A>incontinent and the continent man may be said to be concerned (i.e. whether 
<A NAME="128"></A>with any and every pleasure and pain or with certain determinate kinds), 
<A NAME="129"></A>and whether the continent man and the man of endurance are the same or 
<A NAME="130"></A>different; and similarly with regard to the other matters germane to this 
<A NAME="131"></A>inquiry. The starting-point of our investigation is (a) the question whether 
<A NAME="132"></A>the continent man and the incontinent are differentiated by their objects 
<A NAME="133"></A>or by their attitude, i.e. whether the incontinent man is incontinent simply 
<A NAME="134"></A>by being concerned with such and such objects, or, instead, by his attitude, 
<A NAME="135"></A>or, instead of that, by both these things; (b) the second question is whether 
<A NAME="136"></A>incontinence and continence are concerned with any and every object or 
<A NAME="137"></A>not. The man who is incontinent in the unqualified sense is neither concerned 
<A NAME="138"></A>with any and every object, but with precisely those with which the self-indulgent 
<A NAME="139"></A>man is concerned, nor is he characterized by being simply related to these 
<A NAME="140"></A>(for then his state would be the same as self-indulgence), but by being 
<A NAME="141"></A>related to them in a certain way. For the one is led on in accordance with 
<A NAME="142"></A>his own choice, thinking that he ought always to pursue the present pleasure; 
<A NAME="143"></A>while the other does not think so, but yet pursues it.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>(1) As for the suggestion that it is true opinion and not knowledge 
<A NAME="145"></A>against which we act incontinently, that makes no difference to the argument; 
<A NAME="146"></A>for some people when in a state of opinion do not hesitate, but think they 
<A NAME="147"></A>know exactly. If, then, the notion is that owing to their weak conviction 
<A NAME="148"></A>those who have opinion are more likely to act against their judgement than 
<A NAME="149"></A>those who know, we answer that there need be no difference between knowledge 
<A NAME="150"></A>and opinion in this respect; for some men are no less convinced of what 
<A NAME="151"></A>they think than others of what they know; as is shown by the of Heraclitus. 
<A NAME="152"></A>But (a), since we use the word 'know' in two senses (for both the man who 
<A NAME="153"></A>has knowledge but is not using it and he who is using it are said to know), 
<A NAME="154"></A>it will make a difference whether, when a man does what he should not, 
<A NAME="155"></A>he has the knowledge but is not exercising it, or is exercising it; for 
<A NAME="156"></A>the latter seems strange, but not the former.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>(b) Further, since there are two kinds of premisses, there is nothing 
<A NAME="158"></A>to prevent a man's having both premisses and acting against his knowledge, 
<A NAME="159"></A>provided that he is using only the universal premiss and not the particular; 
<A NAME="160"></A>for it is particular acts that have to be done. And there are also two 
<A NAME="161"></A>kinds of universal term; one is predicable of the agent, the other of the 
<A NAME="162"></A>object; e.g. 'dry food is good for every man', and 'I am a man', or 'such 
<A NAME="163"></A>and such food is dry'; but whether 'this food is such and such', of this 
<A NAME="164"></A>the incontinent man either has not or is not exercising the knowledge. 
<A NAME="165"></A>There will, then, be, firstly, an enormous difference between these manners 
<A NAME="166"></A>of knowing, so that to know in one way when we act incontinently would 
<A NAME="167"></A>not seem anything strange, while to know in the other way would be 
<A NAME="168"></A>extraordinary.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>And further (c) the possession of knowledge in another sense than 
<A NAME="170"></A>those just named is something that happens to men; for within the case 
<A NAME="171"></A>of having knowledge but not using it we see a difference of state, admitting 
<A NAME="172"></A>of the possibility of having knowledge in a sense and yet not having it, 
<A NAME="173"></A>as in the instance of a man asleep, mad, or drunk. But now this is just 
<A NAME="174"></A>the condition of men under the influence of passions; for outbursts of 
<A NAME="175"></A>anger and sexual appetites and some other such passions, it is evident, 
<A NAME="176"></A>actually alter our bodily condition, and in some men even produce fits 
<A NAME="177"></A>of madness. It is plain, then, that incontinent people must be said to 
<A NAME="178"></A>be in a similar condition to men asleep, mad, or drunk. The fact that men 
<A NAME="179"></A>use the language that flows from knowledge proves nothing; for even men 
<A NAME="180"></A>under the influence of these passions utter scientific proofs and verses 
<A NAME="181"></A>of Empedocles, and those who have just begun to learn a science can string 
<A NAME="182"></A>together its phrases, but do not yet know it; for it has to become part 
<A NAME="183"></A>of themselves, and that takes time; so that we must suppose that the use 
<A NAME="184"></A>of language by men in an incontinent state means no more than its utterance 
<A NAME="185"></A>by actors on the stage. (d) Again, we may also view the cause as follows 
<A NAME="186"></A>with reference to the facts of human nature. The one opinion is universal, 
<A NAME="187"></A>the other is concerned with the particular facts, and here we come to something 
<A NAME="188"></A>within the sphere of perception; when a single opinion results from the 
<A NAME="189"></A>two, the soul must in one type of case affirm the conclusion, while in 
<A NAME="190"></A>the case of opinions concerned with production it must immediately act 
<A NAME="191"></A>(e.g. if 'everything sweet ought to be tasted', and 'this is sweet', in 
<A NAME="192"></A>the sense of being one of the particular sweet things, the man who can 
<A NAME="193"></A>act and is not prevented must at the same time actually act accordingly). 
<A NAME="194"></A>When, then, the universal opinion is present in us forbidding us to taste, 
<A NAME="195"></A>and there is also the opinion that 'everything sweet is pleasant', and 
<A NAME="196"></A>that 'this is sweet' (now this is the opinion that is active), and when 
<A NAME="197"></A>appetite happens to be present in us, the one opinion bids us avoid the 
<A NAME="198"></A>object, but appetite leads us towards it (for it can move each of our bodily 
<A NAME="199"></A>parts); so that it turns out that a man behaves incontinently under the 
<A NAME="200"></A>influence (in a sense) of a rule and an opinion, and of one not contrary 
<A NAME="201"></A>in itself, but only incidentally-for the appetite is contrary, not the 
<A NAME="202"></A>opinion-to the right rule. It also follows that this is the reason why 
<A NAME="203"></A>the lower animals are not incontinent, viz. because they have no universal 
<A NAME="204"></A>judgement but only imagination and memory of particulars.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>The explanation of how the ignorance is dissolved and the incontinent 
<A NAME="206"></A>man regains his knowledge, is the same as in the case of the man drunk 
<A NAME="207"></A>or asleep and is not peculiar to this condition; we must go to the students 
<A NAME="208"></A>of natural science for it. Now, the last premiss both being an opinion 
<A NAME="209"></A>about a perceptible object, and being what determines our actions this 
<A NAME="210"></A>a man either has not when he is in the state of passion, or has it in the 
<A NAME="211"></A>sense in which having knowledge did not mean knowing but only talking, 
<A NAME="212"></A>as a drunken man may utter the verses of Empedocles. And because the last 
<A NAME="213"></A>term is not universal nor equally an object of scientific knowledge with 
<A NAME="214"></A>the universal term, the position that Socrates sought to establish actually 
<A NAME="215"></A>seems to result; for it is not in the presence of what is thought to be 
<A NAME="216"></A>knowledge proper that the affection of incontinence arises (nor is it this 
<A NAME="217"></A>that is 'dragged about' as a result of the state of passion), but in that 
<A NAME="218"></A>of perceptual knowledge.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>This must suffice as our answer to the question of action with 
<A NAME="220"></A>and without knowledge, and how it is possible to behave incontinently with 
<A NAME="221"></A>knowledge.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>4
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>(2) We must next discuss whether there is any one who is incontinent 
<A NAME="224"></A>without qualification, or all men who are incontinent are so in a particular 
<A NAME="225"></A>sense, and if there is, with what sort of objects he is concerned. That 
<A NAME="226"></A>both continent persons and persons of endurance, and incontinent and soft 
<A NAME="227"></A>persons, are concerned with pleasures and pains, is 
<A NAME="228"></A>evident.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>Now of the things that produce pleasure some are necessary, while 
<A NAME="230"></A>others are worthy of choice in themselves but admit of excess, the bodily 
<A NAME="231"></A>causes of pleasure being necessary (by such I mean both those concerned 
<A NAME="232"></A>with food and those concerned with sexual intercourse, i.e. the bodily 
<A NAME="233"></A>matters with which we defined self-indulgence and temperance as being concerned), 
<A NAME="234"></A>while the others are not necessary but worthy of choice in themselves (e.g. 
<A NAME="235"></A>victory, honour, wealth, and good and pleasant things of this sort). This 
<A NAME="236"></A>being so, (a) those who go to excess with reference to the latter, contrary 
<A NAME="237"></A>to the right rule which is in themselves, are not called incontinent simply, 
<A NAME="238"></A>but incontinent with the qualification 'in respect of money, gain, honour, 
<A NAME="239"></A>or anger',-not simply incontinent, on the ground that they are different 
<A NAME="240"></A>from incontinent people and are called incontinent by reason of a resemblance. 
<A NAME="241"></A>(Compare the case of Anthropos (Man), who won a contest at the Olympic 
<A NAME="242"></A>games; in his case the general definition of man differed little from the 
<A NAME="243"></A>definition peculiar to him, but yet it was different.) This is shown by 
<A NAME="244"></A>the fact that incontinence either without qualification or in respect of 
<A NAME="245"></A>some particular bodily pleasure is blamed not only as a fault but as a 
<A NAME="246"></A>kind of vice, while none of the people who are incontinent in these other 
<A NAME="247"></A>respects is so blamed.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>But (b) of the people who are incontinent with respect to bodily 
<A NAME="249"></A>enjoyments, with which we say the temperate and the self-indulgent man 
<A NAME="250"></A>are concerned, he who pursues the excesses of things pleasant-and shuns 
<A NAME="251"></A>those of things painful, of hunger and thirst and heat and cold and all 
<A NAME="252"></A>the objects of touch and taste-not by choice but contrary to his choice 
<A NAME="253"></A>and his judgement, is called incontinent, not with the qualification 'in 
<A NAME="254"></A>respect of this or that', e.g. of anger, but just simply. This is confirmed 
<A NAME="255"></A>by the fact that men are called 'soft' with regard to these pleasures, 
<A NAME="256"></A>but not with regard to any of the others. And for this reason we group 
<A NAME="257"></A>together the incontinent and the self-indulgent, the continent and the 
<A NAME="258"></A>temperate man-but not any of these other types-because they are concerned 
<A NAME="259"></A>somehow with the same pleasures and pains; but though these are concerned 
<A NAME="260"></A>with the same objects, they are not similarly related to them, but some 
<A NAME="261"></A>of them make a deliberate choice while the others do 
<A NAME="262"></A>not.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>This is why we should describe as self-indulgent rather the man 
<A NAME="264"></A>who without appetite or with but a slight appetite pursues the excesses 
<A NAME="265"></A>of pleasure and avoids moderate pains, than the man who does so because 
<A NAME="266"></A>of his strong appetites; for what would the former do, if he had in addition 
<A NAME="267"></A>a vigorous appetite, and a violent pain at the lack of the 'necessary' 
<A NAME="268"></A>objects?
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>Now of appetites and pleasures some belong to the class of things 
<A NAME="270"></A>generically noble and good-for some pleasant things are by nature worthy 
<A NAME="271"></A>of choice, while others are contrary to these, and others are intermediate, 
<A NAME="272"></A>to adopt our previous distinction-e.g. wealth, gain, victory, honour. And 
<A NAME="273"></A>with reference to all objects whether of this or of the intermediate kind 
<A NAME="274"></A>men are not blamed for being affected by them, for desiring and loving 
<A NAME="275"></A>them, but for doing so in a certain way, i.e. for going to excess. (This 
<A NAME="276"></A>is why all those who contrary to the rule either are mastered by or pursue 
<A NAME="277"></A>one of the objects which are naturally noble and good, e.g. those who busy 
<A NAME="278"></A>themselves more than they ought about honour or about children and parents, 
<A NAME="279"></A>(are not wicked); for these too are good, and those who busy themselves 
<A NAME="280"></A>about them are praised; but yet there is an excess even in them-if like 
<A NAME="281"></A>Niobe one were to fight even against the gods, or were to be as much devoted 
<A NAME="282"></A>to one's father as Satyrus nicknamed 'the filial', who was thought to be 
<A NAME="283"></A>very silly on this point.) There is no wickedness, then, with regard to 
<A NAME="284"></A>these objects, for the reason named, viz. because each of them is by nature 
<A NAME="285"></A>a thing worthy of choice for its own sake; yet excesses in respect of them 
<A NAME="286"></A>are bad and to be avoided. Similarly there is no incontinence with regard 
<A NAME="287"></A>to them; for incontinence is not only to be avoided but is also a thing 
<A NAME="288"></A>worthy of blame; but owing to a similarity in the state of feeling people 
<A NAME="289"></A>apply the name incontinence, adding in each case what it is in respect 
<A NAME="290"></A>of, as we may describe as a bad doctor or a bad actor one whom we should 
<A NAME="291"></A>not call bad, simply. As, then, in this case we do not apply the term without 
<A NAME="292"></A>qualification because each of these conditions is no shadness but only 
<A NAME="293"></A>analogous to it, so it is clear that in the other case also that alone 
<A NAME="294"></A>must be taken to be incontinence and continence which is concerned with 
<A NAME="295"></A>the same objects as temperance and self-indulgence, but we apply the term 
<A NAME="296"></A>to anger by virtue of a resemblance; and this is why we say with a qualification 
<A NAME="297"></A>'incontinent in respect of anger' as we say 'incontinent in respect of 
<A NAME="298"></A>honour, or of gain'.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>5
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>(1) Some things are pleasant by nature, and of these (a) some are 
<A NAME="301"></A>so without qualification, and (b) others are so with reference to particular 
<A NAME="302"></A>classes either of animals or of men; while (2) others are not pleasant 
<A NAME="303"></A>by nature, but (a) some of them become so by reason of injuries to the 
<A NAME="304"></A>system, and (b) others by reason of acquired habits, and (c) others by 
<A NAME="305"></A>reason of originally bad natures. This being so, it is possible with regard 
<A NAME="306"></A>to each of the latter kinds to discover similar states of character to 
<A NAME="307"></A>those recognized with regard to the former; I mean (A) the brutish states, 
<A NAME="308"></A>as in the case of the female who, they say, rips open pregnant women and 
<A NAME="309"></A>devours the infants, or of the things in which some of the tribes about 
<A NAME="310"></A>the Black Sea that have gone savage are said to delight-in raw meat or 
<A NAME="311"></A>in human flesh, or in lending their children to one another to feast upon-or 
<A NAME="312"></A>of the story told of Phalaris.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>These states are brutish, but (B) others arise as a result of disease 
<A NAME="314"></A>(or, in some cases, of madness, as with the man who sacrificed and ate 
<A NAME="315"></A>his mother, or with the slave who ate the liver of his fellow), and others 
<A NAME="316"></A>are morbid states (C) resulting from custom, e.g. the habit of plucking 
<A NAME="317"></A>out the hair or of gnawing the nails, or even coals or earth, and in addition 
<A NAME="318"></A>to these paederasty; for these arise in some by nature and in others, as 
<A NAME="319"></A>in those who have been the victims of lust from childhood, from 
<A NAME="320"></A>habit.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>Now those in whom nature is the cause of such a state no one would 
<A NAME="322"></A>call incontinent, any more than one would apply the epithet to women because 
<A NAME="323"></A>of the passive part they play in copulation; nor would one apply it to 
<A NAME="324"></A>those who are in a morbid condition as a result of habit. To have these 
<A NAME="325"></A>various types of habit is beyond the limits of vice, as brutishness is 
<A NAME="326"></A>too; for a man who has them to master or be mastered by them is not simple 
<A NAME="327"></A>(continence or) incontinence but that which is so by analogy, as the man 
<A NAME="328"></A>who is in this condition in respect of fits of anger is to be called incontinent 
<A NAME="329"></A>in respect of that feeling but not incontinent simply. For every excessive 
<A NAME="330"></A>state whether of folly, of cowardice, of self-indulgence, or of bad temper, 
<A NAME="331"></A>is either brutish or morbid; the man who is by nature apt to fear everything, 
<A NAME="332"></A>even the squeak of a mouse, is cowardly with a brutish cowardice, while 
<A NAME="333"></A>the man who feared a weasel did so in consequence of disease; and of foolish 
<A NAME="334"></A>people those who by nature are thoughtless and live by their senses alone 
<A NAME="335"></A>are brutish, like some races of the distant barbarians, while those who 
<A NAME="336"></A>are so as a result of disease (e.g. of epilepsy) or of madness are morbid. 
<A NAME="337"></A>Of these characteristics it is possible to have some only at times, and 
<A NAME="338"></A>not to be mastered by them. e.g. Phalaris may have restrained a desire 
<A NAME="339"></A>to eat the flesh of a child or an appetite for unnatural sexual pleasure; 
<A NAME="340"></A>but it is also possible to be mastered, not merely to have the feelings. 
<A NAME="341"></A>Thus, as the wickedness which is on the human level is called wickedness 
<A NAME="342"></A>simply, while that which is not is called wickedness not simply but with 
<A NAME="343"></A>the qualification 'brutish' or 'morbid', in the same way it is plain that 
<A NAME="344"></A>some incontinence is brutish and some morbid, while only that which corresponds 
<A NAME="345"></A>to human self-indulgence is incontinence simply.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>That incontinence and continence, then, are concerned only with 
<A NAME="347"></A>the same objects as selfindulgence and temperance and that what is concerned 
<A NAME="348"></A>with other objects is a type distinct from incontinence, and called incontinence 
<A NAME="349"></A>by a metaphor and not simply, is plain.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>6
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>That incontinence in respect of anger is less disgraceful than 
<A NAME="352"></A>that in respect of the appetites is what we will now proceed to see. (1) 
<A NAME="353"></A>Anger seems to listen to argument to some extent, but to mishear it, as 
<A NAME="354"></A>do hasty servants who run out before they have heard the whole of what 
<A NAME="355"></A>one says, and then muddle the order, or as dogs bark if there is but a 
<A NAME="356"></A>knock at the door, before looking to see if it is a friend; so anger by 
<A NAME="357"></A>reason of the warmth and hastiness of its nature, though it hears, does 
<A NAME="358"></A>not hear an order, and springs to take revenge. For argument or imagination 
<A NAME="359"></A>informs us that we have been insulted or slighted, and anger, reasoning 
<A NAME="360"></A>as it were that anything like this must be fought against, boils up straightway; 
<A NAME="361"></A>while appetite, if argument or perception merely says that an object is 
<A NAME="362"></A>pleasant, springs to the enjoyment of it. Therefore anger obeys the argument 
<A NAME="363"></A>in a sense, but appetite does not. It is therefore more disgraceful; for 
<A NAME="364"></A>the man who is incontinent in respect of anger is in a sense conquered 
<A NAME="365"></A>by argument, while the other is conquered by appetite and not by 
<A NAME="366"></A>argument.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR>(2) Further, we pardon people more easily for following natural 
<A NAME="368"></A>desires, since we pardon them more easily for following such appetites 
<A NAME="369"></A>as are common to all men, and in so far as they are common; now anger and 
<A NAME="370"></A>bad temper are more natural than the appetites for excess, i.e. for unnecessary 
<A NAME="371"></A>objects. Take for instance the man who defended himself on the charge of 
<A NAME="372"></A>striking his father by saying 'yes, but he struck his father, and he struck 
<A NAME="373"></A>his, and' (pointing to his child) 'this boy will strike me when he is a 
<A NAME="374"></A>man; it runs in the family'; or the man who when he was being dragged along 
<A NAME="375"></A>by his son bade him stop at the doorway, since he himself had dragged his 
<A NAME="376"></A>father only as far as that.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>(2) Further, those who are more given to plotting against others 
<A NAME="378"></A>are more criminal. Now a passionate man is not given to plotting, nor is 
<A NAME="379"></A>anger itself-it is open; but the nature of appetite is illustrated by what 
<A NAME="380"></A>the poets call Aphrodite, 'guile-weaving daughter of Cyprus', and by Homer's 
<A NAME="381"></A>words about her 'embroidered girdle':
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>And the whisper of wooing is there,
<A NAME="383"></A><BR>Whose subtlety stealeth the wits of the wise, how prudent soe'er. Therefore 
<A NAME="384"></A>if this form of incontinence is more criminal and disgraceful than that 
<A NAME="385"></A>in respect of anger, it is both incontinence without qualification and 
<A NAME="386"></A>in a sense vice.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>(4) Further, no one commits wanton outrage with a feeling of pain, 
<A NAME="388"></A>but every one who acts in anger acts with pain, while the man who commits 
<A NAME="389"></A>outrage acts with pleasure. If, then, those acts at which it is most just 
<A NAME="390"></A>to be angry are more criminal than others, the incontinence which is due 
<A NAME="391"></A>to appetite is the more criminal; for there is no wanton outrage involved 
<A NAME="392"></A>in anger.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>Plainly, then, the incontinence concerned with appetite is more 
<A NAME="394"></A>disgraceful than that concerned with anger, and continence and incontinence 
<A NAME="395"></A>are concerned with bodily appetites and pleasures; but we must grasp the 
<A NAME="396"></A>differences among the latter themselves. For, as has been said at the beginning, 
<A NAME="397"></A>some are human and natural both in kind and in magnitude, others are brutish, 
<A NAME="398"></A>and others are due to organic injuries and diseases. Only with the first 
<A NAME="399"></A>of these are temperance and self-indulgence concerned; this is why we call 
<A NAME="400"></A>the lower animals neither temperate nor self-indulgent except by a metaphor, 
<A NAME="401"></A>and only if some one race of animals exceeds another as a whole in wantonness, 
<A NAME="402"></A>destructiveness, and omnivorous greed; these have no power of choice or 
<A NAME="403"></A>calculation, but they are departures from the natural norm, as, among men, 
<A NAME="404"></A>madmen are. Now brutishness is a less evil than vice, though more alarming; 
<A NAME="405"></A>for it is not that the better part has been perverted, as in man,-they 
<A NAME="406"></A>have no better part. Thus it is like comparing a lifeless thing with a 
<A NAME="407"></A>living in respect of badness; for the badness of that which has no originative 
<A NAME="408"></A>source of movement is always less hurtful, and reason is an originative 
<A NAME="409"></A>source. Thus it is like comparing injustice in the abstract with an unjust 
<A NAME="410"></A>man. Each is in some sense worse; for a bad man will do ten thousand times 
<A NAME="411"></A>as much evil as a brute.
<A NAME="412"></A><BR><BR>7
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>With regard to the pleasures and pains and appetites and aversions 
<A NAME="414"></A>arising through touch and taste, to which both self-indulgence and temperance 
<A NAME="415"></A>were formerly narrowed down, it possible to be in such a state as to be 
<A NAME="416"></A>defeated even by those of them which most people master, or to master even 
<A NAME="417"></A>those by which most people are defeated; among these possibilities, those 
<A NAME="418"></A>relating to pleasures are incontinence and continence, those relating to 
<A NAME="419"></A>pains softness and endurance. The state of most people is intermediate, 
<A NAME="420"></A>even if they lean more towards the worse states.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>Now, since some pleasures are necessary while others are not, and 
<A NAME="422"></A>are necessary up to a point while the excesses of them are not, nor the 
<A NAME="423"></A>deficiencies, and this is equally true of appetites and pains, the man 
<A NAME="424"></A>who pursues the excesses of things pleasant, or pursues to excess necessary 
<A NAME="425"></A>objects, and does so by choice, for their own sake and not at all for the 
<A NAME="426"></A>sake of any result distinct from them, is self-indulgent; for such a man 
<A NAME="427"></A>is of necessity unlikely to repent, and therefore incurable, since a man 
<A NAME="428"></A>who cannot repent cannot be cured. The man who is deficient in his pursuit 
<A NAME="429"></A>of them is the opposite of self-indulgent; the man who is intermediate 
<A NAME="430"></A>is temperate. Similarly, there is the man who avoids bodily pains not because 
<A NAME="431"></A>he is defeated by them but by choice. (Of those who do not choose such 
<A NAME="432"></A>acts, one kind of man is led to them as a result of the pleasure involved, 
<A NAME="433"></A>another because he avoids the pain arising from the appetite, so that these 
<A NAME="434"></A>types differ from one another. Now any one would think worse of a man with 
<A NAME="435"></A>no appetite or with weak appetite were he to do something disgraceful, 
<A NAME="436"></A>than if he did it under the influence of powerful appetite, and worse of 
<A NAME="437"></A>him if he struck a blow not in anger than if he did it in anger; for what 
<A NAME="438"></A>would he have done if he had been strongly affected? This is why the self-indulgent 
<A NAME="439"></A>man is worse than the incontinent.) of the states named, then, the latter 
<A NAME="440"></A>is rather a kind of softness; the former is self-indulgence. While to the 
<A NAME="441"></A>incontinent man is opposed the continent, to the soft is opposed the man 
<A NAME="442"></A>of endurance; for endurance consists in resisting, while continence consists 
<A NAME="443"></A>in conquering, and resisting and conquering are different, as not being 
<A NAME="444"></A>beaten is different from winning; this is why continence is also more worthy 
<A NAME="445"></A>of choice than endurance. Now the man who is defective in respect of resistance 
<A NAME="446"></A>to the things which most men both resist and resist successfully is soft 
<A NAME="447"></A>and effeminate; for effeminacy too is a kind of softness; such a man trails 
<A NAME="448"></A>his cloak to avoid the pain of lifting it, and plays the invalid without 
<A NAME="449"></A>thinking himself wretched, though the man he imitates is a wretched 
<A NAME="450"></A>man.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>The case is similar with regard to continence and incontinence. 
<A NAME="452"></A>For if a man is defeated by violent and excessive pleasures or pains, there 
<A NAME="453"></A>is nothing wonderful in that; indeed we are ready to pardon him if he has 
<A NAME="454"></A>resisted, as Theodectes' Philoctetes does when bitten by the snake, or 
<A NAME="455"></A>Carcinus' Cercyon in the Alope, and as people who try to restrain their 
<A NAME="456"></A>laughter burst out into a guffaw, as happened to Xenophantus. But it is 
<A NAME="457"></A>surprising if a man is defeated by and cannot resist pleasures or pains 
<A NAME="458"></A>which most men can hold out against, when this is not due to heredity or 
<A NAME="459"></A>disease, like the softness that is hereditary with the kings of the Scythians, 
<A NAME="460"></A>or that which distinguishes the female sex from the 
<A NAME="461"></A>male.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR>The lover of amusement, too, is thought to be self-indulgent, but 
<A NAME="463"></A>is really soft. For amusement is a relaxation, since it is a rest from 
<A NAME="464"></A>work; and the lover of amusement is one of the people who go to excess 
<A NAME="465"></A>in this.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR>Of incontinence one kind is impetuosity, another weakness. For 
<A NAME="467"></A>some men after deliberating fail, owing to their emotion, to stand by the 
<A NAME="468"></A>conclusions of their deliberation, others because they have not deliberated 
<A NAME="469"></A>are led by their emotion; since some men (just as people who first tickle 
<A NAME="470"></A>others are not tickled themselves), if they have first perceived and seen 
<A NAME="471"></A>what is coming and have first roused themselves and their calculative faculty, 
<A NAME="472"></A>are not defeated by their emotion, whether it be pleasant or painful. It 
<A NAME="473"></A>is keen and excitable people that suffer especially from the impetuous 
<A NAME="474"></A>form of incontinence; for the former by reason of their quickness and the 
<A NAME="475"></A>latter by reason of the violence of their passions do not await the argument, 
<A NAME="476"></A>because they are apt to follow their imagination.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR>8
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>The self-indulgent man, as was said, is not apt to repent; for 
<A NAME="479"></A>he stands by his choice; but incontinent man is likely to repent. This 
<A NAME="480"></A>is why the position is not as it was expressed in the formulation of the 
<A NAME="481"></A>problem, but the selfindulgent man is incurable and the incontinent man 
<A NAME="482"></A>curable; for wickedness is like a disease such as dropsy or consumption, 
<A NAME="483"></A>while incontinence is like epilepsy; the former is a permanent, the latter 
<A NAME="484"></A>an intermittent badness. And generally incontinence and vice are different 
<A NAME="485"></A>in kind; vice is unconscious of itself, incontinence is not (of incontinent 
<A NAME="486"></A>men themselves, those who become temporarily beside themselves are better 
<A NAME="487"></A>than those who have the rational principle but do not abide by it, since 
<A NAME="488"></A>the latter are defeated by a weaker passion, and do not act without previous 
<A NAME="489"></A>deliberation like the others); for the incontinent man is like the people 
<A NAME="490"></A>who get drunk quickly and on little wine, i.e. on less than most 
<A NAME="491"></A>people.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>Evidently, then, incontinence is not vice (though perhaps it is 
<A NAME="493"></A>so in a qualified sense); for incontinence is contrary to choice while 
<A NAME="494"></A>vice is in accordance with choice; not but what they are similar in respect 
<A NAME="495"></A>of the actions they lead to; as in the saying of Demodocus about the Milesians, 
<A NAME="496"></A>'the Milesians are not without sense, but they do the things that senseless 
<A NAME="497"></A>people do', so too incontinent people are not criminal, but they will do 
<A NAME="498"></A>criminal acts.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR>Now, since the incontinent man is apt to pursue, not on conviction, 
<A NAME="500"></A>bodily pleasures that are excessive and contrary to the right rule, while 
<A NAME="501"></A>the self-indulgent man is convinced because he is the sort of man to pursue 
<A NAME="502"></A>them, it is on the contrary the former that is easily persuaded to change 
<A NAME="503"></A>his mind, while the latter is not. For virtue and vice respectively preserve 
<A NAME="504"></A>and destroy the first principle, and in actions the final cause is the 
<A NAME="505"></A>first principle, as the hypotheses are in mathematics; neither in that 
<A NAME="506"></A>case is it argument that teaches the first principles, nor is it so here-virtue 
<A NAME="507"></A>either natural or produced by habituation is what teaches right opinion 
<A NAME="508"></A>about the first principle. Such a man as this, then, is temperate; his 
<A NAME="509"></A>contrary is the self-indulgent.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>But there is a sort of man who is carried away as a result of passion 
<A NAME="511"></A>and contrary to the right rule-a man whom passion masters so that he does 
<A NAME="512"></A>not act according to the right rule, but does not master to the extent 
<A NAME="513"></A>of making him ready to believe that he ought to pursue such pleasures without 
<A NAME="514"></A>reserve; this is the incontinent man, who is better than the self-indulgent 
<A NAME="515"></A>man, and not bad without qualification; for the best thing in him, the 
<A NAME="516"></A>first principle, is preserved. And contrary to him is another kind of man, 
<A NAME="517"></A>he who abides by his convictions and is not carried away, at least as a 
<A NAME="518"></A>result of passion. It is evident from these considerations that the latter 
<A NAME="519"></A>is a good state and the former a bad one.
<A NAME="520"></A><BR><BR>9
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>Is the man continent who abides by any and every rule and any and 
<A NAME="522"></A>every choice, or the man who abides by the right choice, and is he incontinent 
<A NAME="523"></A>who abandons any and every choice and any and every rule, or he who abandons 
<A NAME="524"></A>the rule that is not false and the choice that is right; this is how we 
<A NAME="525"></A>put it before in our statement of the problem. Or is it incidentally any 
<A NAME="526"></A>and every choice but per se the true rule and the right choice by which 
<A NAME="527"></A>the one abides and the other does not? If any one chooses or pursues this 
<A NAME="528"></A>for the sake of that, per se he pursues and chooses the latter, but incidentally 
<A NAME="529"></A>the former. But when we speak without qualification we mean what is per 
<A NAME="530"></A>se. Therefore in a sense the one abides by, and the other abandons, any 
<A NAME="531"></A>and every opinion; but without qualification, the true 
<A NAME="532"></A>opinion.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>There are some who are apt to abide by their opinion, who are called 
<A NAME="534"></A>strong-headed, viz. those who are hard to persuade in the first instance 
<A NAME="535"></A>and are not easily persuaded to change; these have in them something like 
<A NAME="536"></A>the continent man, as the prodigal is in a way like the liberal man and 
<A NAME="537"></A>the rash man like the confident man; but they are different in many respects. 
<A NAME="538"></A>For it is to passion and appetite that the one will not yield, since on 
<A NAME="539"></A>occasion the continent man will be easy to persuade; but it is to argument 
<A NAME="540"></A>that the others refuse to yield, for they do form appetites and many of 
<A NAME="541"></A>them are led by their pleasures. Now the people who are strong-headed are 
<A NAME="542"></A>the opinionated, the ignorant, and the boorish-the opinionated being influenced 
<A NAME="543"></A>by pleasure and pain; for they delight in the victory they gain if they 
<A NAME="544"></A>are not persuaded to change, and are pained if their decisions become null 
<A NAME="545"></A>and void as decrees sometimes do; so that they are liker the incontinent 
<A NAME="546"></A>than the continent man.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>But there are some who fail to abide by their resolutions, not 
<A NAME="548"></A>as a result of incontinence, e.g. Neoptolemus in Sophocles' Philoctetes; 
<A NAME="549"></A>yet it was for the sake of pleasure that he did not stand fast-but a noble 
<A NAME="550"></A>pleasure; for telling the truth was noble to him, but he had been persuaded 
<A NAME="551"></A>by Odysseus to tell the lie. For not every one who does anything for the 
<A NAME="552"></A>sake of pleasure is either self-indulgent or bad or incontinent, but he 
<A NAME="553"></A>who does it for a disgraceful pleasure.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>Since there is also a sort of man who takes less delight than he 
<A NAME="555"></A>should in bodily things, and does not abide by the rule, he who is intermediate 
<A NAME="556"></A>between him and the incontinent man is the continent man; for the incontinent 
<A NAME="557"></A>man fails to abide by the rule because he delights too much in them, and 
<A NAME="558"></A>this man because he delights in them too little; while the continent man 
<A NAME="559"></A>abides by the rule and does not change on either account. Now if continence 
<A NAME="560"></A>is good, both the contrary states must be bad, as they actually appear 
<A NAME="561"></A>to be; but because the other extreme is seen in few people and seldom, 
<A NAME="562"></A>as temperance is thought to be contrary only to self-indulgence, so is 
<A NAME="563"></A>continence to incontinence.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>Since many names are applied analogically, it is by analogy that 
<A NAME="565"></A>we have come to speak of the 'continence' the temperate man; for both the 
<A NAME="566"></A>continent man and the temperate man are such as to do nothing contrary 
<A NAME="567"></A>to the rule for the sake of the bodily pleasures, but the former has and 
<A NAME="568"></A>the latter has not bad appetites, and the latter is such as not to feel 
<A NAME="569"></A>pleasure contrary to the rule, while the former is such as to feel pleasure 
<A NAME="570"></A>but not to be led by it. And the incontinent and the self-indulgent man 
<A NAME="571"></A>are also like another; they are different, but both pursue bodily pleasures- 
<A NAME="572"></A>the latter, however, also thinking that he ought to do so, while the former 
<A NAME="573"></A>does not think this.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>10
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR>Nor can the same man have practical wisdom and be incontinent; 
<A NAME="576"></A>for it has been shown' that a man is at the same time practically wise, 
<A NAME="577"></A>and good in respect of character. Further, a man has practical wisdom not 
<A NAME="578"></A>by knowing only but by being able to act; but the incontinent man is unable 
<A NAME="579"></A>to act-there is, however, nothing to prevent a clever man from being incontinent; 
<A NAME="580"></A>this is why it is sometimes actually thought that some people have practical 
<A NAME="581"></A>wisdom but are incontinent, viz. because cleverness and practical wisdom 
<A NAME="582"></A>differ in the way we have described in our first discussions, and are near 
<A NAME="583"></A>together in respect of their reasoning, but differ in respect of their 
<A NAME="584"></A>purpose-nor yet is the incontinent man like the man who knows and is contemplating 
<A NAME="585"></A>a truth, but like the man who is asleep or drunk. And he acts willingly 
<A NAME="586"></A>(for he acts in a sense with knowledge both of what he does and of the 
<A NAME="587"></A>end to which he does it), but is not wicked, since his purpose is good; 
<A NAME="588"></A>so that he is half-wicked. And he is not a criminal; for he does not act 
<A NAME="589"></A>of malice aforethought; of the two types of incontinent man the one does 
<A NAME="590"></A>not abide by the conclusions of his deliberation, while the excitable man 
<A NAME="591"></A>does not deliberate at all. And thus the incontinent man like a city which 
<A NAME="592"></A>passes all the right decrees and has good laws, but makes no use of them, 
<A NAME="593"></A>as in Anaxandrides' jesting remark,
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR>The city willed it, that cares nought for laws; but the wicked 
<A NAME="595"></A>man is like a city that uses its laws, but has wicked laws to 
<A NAME="596"></A>use.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>Now incontinence and continence are concerned with that which is 
<A NAME="598"></A>in excess of the state characteristic of most men; for the continent man 
<A NAME="599"></A>abides by his resolutions more and the incontinent man less than most men 
<A NAME="600"></A>can.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>Of the forms of incontinence, that of excitable people is more 
<A NAME="602"></A>curable than that of those who deliberate but do not abide by their decisions, 
<A NAME="603"></A>and those who are incontinent through habituation are more curable than 
<A NAME="604"></A>those in whom incontinence is innate; for it is easier to change a habit 
<A NAME="605"></A>than to change one's nature; even habit is hard to change just because 
<A NAME="606"></A>it is like nature, as Evenus says:
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>I say that habit's but a long practice, friend,
<A NAME="608"></A><BR>And this becomes men's nature in the end.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR>We have now stated what continence, incontinence, endurance, and 
<A NAME="610"></A>softness are, and how these states are related to each 
<A NAME="611"></A>other.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>11
<A NAME="613"></A><BR><BR>The study of pleasure and pain belongs to the province of the political 
<A NAME="614"></A>philosopher; for he is the architect of the end, with a view to which we 
<A NAME="615"></A>call one thing bad and another good without qualification. Further, it 
<A NAME="616"></A>is one of our necessary tasks to consider them; for not only did we lay 
<A NAME="617"></A>it down that moral virtue and vice are concerned with pains and pleasures, 
<A NAME="618"></A>but most people say that happiness involves pleasure; this is why the blessed 
<A NAME="619"></A>man is called by a name derived from a word meaning 
<A NAME="620"></A>enjoyment.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR>Now (1) some people think that no pleasure is a good, either in 
<A NAME="622"></A>itself or incidentally, since the good and pleasure are not the same; (2) 
<A NAME="623"></A>others think that some pleasures are good but that most are bad. (3) Again 
<A NAME="624"></A>there is a third view, that even if all pleasures are good, yet the best 
<A NAME="625"></A>thing in the world cannot be pleasure. (1) The reasons given for the view 
<A NAME="626"></A>that pleasure is not a good at all are (a) that every pleasure is a perceptible 
<A NAME="627"></A>process to a natural state, and that no process is of the same kind as 
<A NAME="628"></A>its end, e.g. no process of building of the same kind as a house. (b) A 
<A NAME="629"></A>temperate man avoids pleasures. (c) A man of practical wisdom pursues what 
<A NAME="630"></A>is free from pain, not what is pleasant. (d) The pleasures are a hindrance 
<A NAME="631"></A>to thought, and the more so the more one delights in them, e.g. in sexual 
<A NAME="632"></A>pleasure; for no one could think of anything while absorbed in this. (e) 
<A NAME="633"></A>There is no art of pleasure; but every good is the product of some art. 
<A NAME="634"></A>(f) Children and the brutes pursue pleasures. (2) The reasons for the view 
<A NAME="635"></A>that not all pleasures are good are that (a) there are pleasures that are 
<A NAME="636"></A>actually base and objects of reproach, and (b) there are harmful pleasures; 
<A NAME="637"></A>for some pleasant things are unhealthy. (3) The reason for the view that 
<A NAME="638"></A>the best thing in the world is not pleasure is that pleasure is not an 
<A NAME="639"></A>end but a process.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>12
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>These are pretty much the things that are said. That it does not 
<A NAME="642"></A>follow from these grounds that pleasure is not a good, or even the chief 
<A NAME="643"></A>good, is plain from the following considerations. (A) (a) First, since 
<A NAME="644"></A>that which is good may be so in either of two senses (one thing good simply 
<A NAME="645"></A>and another good for a particular person), natural constitutions and states 
<A NAME="646"></A>of being, and therefore also the corresponding movements and processes, 
<A NAME="647"></A>will be correspondingly divisible. Of those which are thought to be bad 
<A NAME="648"></A>some will be bad if taken without qualification but not bad for a particular 
<A NAME="649"></A>person, but worthy of his choice, and some will not be worthy of choice 
<A NAME="650"></A>even for a particular person, but only at a particular time and for a short 
<A NAME="651"></A>period, though not without qualification; while others are not even pleasures, 
<A NAME="652"></A>but seem to be so, viz. all those which involve pain and whose end is curative, 
<A NAME="653"></A>e.g. the processes that go on in sick persons.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>(b) Further, one kind of good being activity and another being 
<A NAME="655"></A>state, the processes that restore us to our natural state are only incidentally 
<A NAME="656"></A>pleasant; for that matter the activity at work in the appetites for them 
<A NAME="657"></A>is the activity of so much of our state and nature as has remained unimpaired; 
<A NAME="658"></A>for there are actually pleasures that involve no pain or appetite (e.g. 
<A NAME="659"></A>those of contemplation), the nature in such a case not being defective 
<A NAME="660"></A>at all. That the others are incidental is indicated by the fact that men 
<A NAME="661"></A>do not enjoy the same pleasant objects when their nature is in its settled 
<A NAME="662"></A>state as they do when it is being replenished, but in the former case they 
<A NAME="663"></A>enjoy the things that are pleasant without qualification, in the latter 
<A NAME="664"></A>the contraries of these as well; for then they enjoy even sharp and bitter 
<A NAME="665"></A>things, none of which is pleasant either by nature or without qualification. 
<A NAME="666"></A>The states they produce, therefore, are not pleasures naturally or without 
<A NAME="667"></A>qualification; for as pleasant things differ, so do the pleasures arising 
<A NAME="668"></A>from them.
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>(c) Again, it is not necessary that there should be something else 
<A NAME="670"></A>better than pleasure, as some say the end is better than the process; for 
<A NAME="671"></A>leasures are not processes nor do they all involve process-they are activities 
<A NAME="672"></A>and ends; nor do they arise when we are becoming something, but when we 
<A NAME="673"></A>are exercising some faculty; and not all pleasures have an end different 
<A NAME="674"></A>from themselves, but only the pleasures of persons who are being led to 
<A NAME="675"></A>the perfecting of their nature. This is why it is not right to say that 
<A NAME="676"></A>pleasure is perceptible process, but it should rather be called activity 
<A NAME="677"></A>of the natural state, and instead of 'perceptible' 'unimpeded'. It is thought 
<A NAME="678"></A>by some people to be process just because they think it is in the strict 
<A NAME="679"></A>sense good; for they think that activity is process, which it is 
<A NAME="680"></A>not.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>(B) The view that pleasures are bad because some pleasant things 
<A NAME="682"></A>are unhealthy is like saying that healthy things are bad because some healthy 
<A NAME="683"></A>things are bad for money-making; both are bad in the respect mentioned, 
<A NAME="684"></A>but they are not bad for that reason-indeed, thinking itself is sometimes 
<A NAME="685"></A>injurious to health.
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR>Neither practical wisdom nor any state of being is impeded by the 
<A NAME="687"></A>pleasure arising from it; it is foreign pleasures that impede, for the 
<A NAME="688"></A>pleasures arising from thinking and learning will make us think and learn 
<A NAME="689"></A>all the more.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>(C) The fact that no pleasure is the product of any art arises 
<A NAME="691"></A>naturally enough; there is no art of any other activity either, but only 
<A NAME="692"></A>of the corresponding faculty; though for that matter the arts of the perfumer 
<A NAME="693"></A>and the cook are thought to be arts of pleasure.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>(D) The arguments based on the grounds that the temperate man avoids 
<A NAME="695"></A>pleasure and that the man of practical wisdom pursues the painless life, 
<A NAME="696"></A>and that children and the brutes pursue pleasure, are all refuted by the 
<A NAME="697"></A>same consideration. We have pointed out in what sense pleasures are good 
<A NAME="698"></A>without qualification and in what sense some are not good; now both the 
<A NAME="699"></A>brutes and children pursue pleasures of the latter kind (and the man of 
<A NAME="700"></A>practical wisdom pursues tranquil freedom from that kind), viz. those which 
<A NAME="701"></A>imply appetite and pain, i.e. the bodily pleasures (for it is these that 
<A NAME="702"></A>are of this nature) and the excesses of them, in respect of which the self-indulgent 
<A NAME="703"></A>man is self-indulent. This is why the temperate man avoids these pleasures; 
<A NAME="704"></A>for even he has pleasures of his own.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR><BR>13
<A NAME="706"></A><BR><BR>But further (E) it is agreed that pain is bad and to be avoided; 
<A NAME="707"></A>for some pain is without qualification bad, and other pain is bad because 
<A NAME="708"></A>it is in some respect an impediment to us. Now the contrary of that which 
<A NAME="709"></A>is to be avoided, qua something to be avoided and bad, is good. Pleasure, 
<A NAME="710"></A>then, is necessarily a good. For the answer of Speusippus, that pleasure 
<A NAME="711"></A>is contrary both to pain and to good, as the greater is contrary both to 
<A NAME="712"></A>the less and to the equal, is not successful; since he would not say that 
<A NAME="713"></A>pleasure is essentially just a species of evil.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR><BR>And (F) if certain pleasures are bad, that does not prevent the 
<A NAME="715"></A>chief good from being some pleasure, just as the chief good may be some 
<A NAME="716"></A>form of knowledge though certain kinds of knowledge are bad. Perhaps it 
<A NAME="717"></A>is even necessary, if each disposition has unimpeded activities, that, 
<A NAME="718"></A>whether the activity (if unimpeded) of all our dispositions or that of 
<A NAME="719"></A>some one of them is happiness, this should be the thing most worthy of 
<A NAME="720"></A>our choice; and this activity is pleasure. Thus the chief good would be 
<A NAME="721"></A>some pleasure, though most pleasures might perhaps be bad without qualification. 
<A NAME="722"></A>And for this reason all men think that the happy life is pleasant and weave 
<A NAME="723"></A>pleasure into their ideal of happiness-and reasonably too; for no activity 
<A NAME="724"></A>is perfect when it is impeded, and happiness is a perfect thing; this is 
<A NAME="725"></A>why the happy man needs the goods of the body and external goods, i.e. 
<A NAME="726"></A>those of fortune, viz. in order that he may not be impeded in these ways. 
<A NAME="727"></A>Those who say that the victim on the rack or the man who falls into great 
<A NAME="728"></A>misfortunes is happy if he is good, are, whether they mean to or not, talking 
<A NAME="729"></A>nonsense. Now because we need fortune as well as other things, some people 
<A NAME="730"></A>think good fortune the same thing as happiness; but it is not that, for 
<A NAME="731"></A>even good fortune itself when in excess is an impediment, and perhaps should 
<A NAME="732"></A>then be no longer called good fortune; for its limit is fixed by reference 
<A NAME="733"></A>to happiness.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR>And indeed the fact that all things, both brutes and men, pursue 
<A NAME="735"></A>pleasure is an indication of its being somehow the chief 
<A NAME="736"></A>good:
<A NAME="737"></A><BR><BR>No voice is wholly lost that many peoples... But since no one nature 
<A NAME="738"></A>or state either is or is thought the best for all, neither do all pursue 
<A NAME="739"></A>the same pleasure; yet all pursue pleasure. And perhaps they actually pursue 
<A NAME="740"></A>not the pleasure they think they pursue nor that which they would say they 
<A NAME="741"></A>pursue, but the same pleasure; for all things have by nature something 
<A NAME="742"></A>divine in them. But the bodily pleasures have appropriated the name both 
<A NAME="743"></A>because we oftenest steer our course for them and because all men share 
<A NAME="744"></A>in them; thus because they alone are familiar, men think there are no 
<A NAME="745"></A>others.
<A NAME="746"></A><BR><BR>It is evident also that if pleasure, i.e. the activity of our faculties, 
<A NAME="747"></A>is not a good, it will not be the case that the happy man lives a pleasant 
<A NAME="748"></A>life; for to what end should he need pleasure, if it is not a good but 
<A NAME="749"></A>the happy man may even live a painful life? For pain is neither an evil 
<A NAME="750"></A>nor a good, if pleasure is not; why then should he avoid it? Therefore, 
<A NAME="751"></A>too, the life of the good man will not be pleasanter than that of any one 
<A NAME="752"></A>else, if his activities are not more pleasant.
<A NAME="753"></A><BR><BR>14
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>(G) With regard to the bodily pleasures, those who say that some 
<A NAME="755"></A>pleasures are very much to be chosen, viz. the noble pleasures, but not 
<A NAME="756"></A>the bodily pleasures, i.e. those with which the self-indulgent man is concerned, 
<A NAME="757"></A>must consider why, then, the contrary pains are bad. For the contrary of 
<A NAME="758"></A>bad is good. Are the necessary pleasures good in the sense in which even 
<A NAME="759"></A>that which is not bad is good? Or are they good up to a point? Is it that 
<A NAME="760"></A>where you have states and processes of which there cannot be too much, 
<A NAME="761"></A>there cannot be too much of the corresponding pleasure, and that where 
<A NAME="762"></A>there can be too much of the one there can be too much of the other also? 
<A NAME="763"></A>Now there can be too much of bodily goods, and the bad man is bad by virtue 
<A NAME="764"></A>of pursuing the excess, not by virtue of pursuing the necessary pleasures 
<A NAME="765"></A>(for all men enjoy in some way or other both dainty foods and wines and 
<A NAME="766"></A>sexual intercourse, but not all men do so as they ought). The contrary 
<A NAME="767"></A>is the case with pain; for he does not avoid the excess of it, he avoids 
<A NAME="768"></A>it altogether; and this is peculiar to him, for the alternative to excess 
<A NAME="769"></A>of pleasure is not pain, except to the man who pursues this 
<A NAME="770"></A>excess.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR><BR>Since we should state not only the truth, but also the cause of 
<A NAME="772"></A>error-for this contributes towards producing conviction, since when a reasonable 
<A NAME="773"></A>explanation is given of why the false view appears true, this tends to 
<A NAME="774"></A>produce belief in the true view-therefore we must state why the bodily 
<A NAME="775"></A>pleasures appear the more worthy of choice. (a) Firstly, then, it is because 
<A NAME="776"></A>they expel pain; owing to the excesses of pain that men experience, they 
<A NAME="777"></A>pursue excessive and in general bodily pleasure as being a cure for the 
<A NAME="778"></A>pain. Now curative agencies produce intense feeling-which is the reason 
<A NAME="779"></A>why they are pursued-because they show up against the contrary pain. (Indeed 
<A NAME="780"></A>pleasure is thought not to be good for these two reasons, as has been said, 
<A NAME="781"></A>viz. that (a) some of them are activities belonging to a bad nature-either 
<A NAME="782"></A>congenital, as in the case of a brute, or due to habit, i.e. those of bad 
<A NAME="783"></A>men; while (b) others are meant to cure a defective nature, and it is better 
<A NAME="784"></A>to be in a healthy state than to be getting into it, but these arise during 
<A NAME="785"></A>the process of being made perfect and are therefore only incidentally good.) 
<A NAME="786"></A>(b) Further, they are pursued because of their violence by those who cannot 
<A NAME="787"></A>enjoy other pleasures. (At all events they go out of their way to manufacture 
<A NAME="788"></A>thirsts somehow for themselves. When these are harmless, the practice is 
<A NAME="789"></A>irreproachable; when they are hurtful, it is bad.) For they have nothing 
<A NAME="790"></A>else to enjoy, and, besides, a neutral state is painful to many people 
<A NAME="791"></A>because of their nature. For the animal nature is always in travail, as 
<A NAME="792"></A>the students of natural science also testify, saying that sight and hearing 
<A NAME="793"></A>are painful; but we have become used to this, as they maintain. Similarly, 
<A NAME="794"></A>while, in youth, people are, owing to the growth that is going on, in a 
<A NAME="795"></A>situation like that of drunken men, and youth is pleasant, on the other 
<A NAME="796"></A>hand people of excitable nature always need relief; for even their body 
<A NAME="797"></A>is ever in torment owing to its special composition, and they are always 
<A NAME="798"></A>under the influence of violent desire; but pain is driven out both by the 
<A NAME="799"></A>contrary pleasure, and by any chance pleasure if it be strong; and for 
<A NAME="800"></A>these reasons they become self-indulgent and bad. But the pleasures that 
<A NAME="801"></A>do not involve pains do not admit of excess; and these are among the things 
<A NAME="802"></A>pleasant by nature and not incidentally. By things pleasant incidentally 
<A NAME="803"></A>I mean those that act as cures (for because as a result people are cured, 
<A NAME="804"></A>through some action of the part that remains healthy, for this reason the 
<A NAME="805"></A>process is thought pleasant); by things naturally pleasant I mean those 
<A NAME="806"></A>that stimulate the action of the healthy nature.
<A NAME="807"></A><BR><BR>There is no one thing that is always pleasant, because our nature 
<A NAME="808"></A>is not simple but there is another element in us as well, inasmuch as we 
<A NAME="809"></A>are perishable creatures, so that if the one element does something, this 
<A NAME="810"></A>is unnatural to the other nature, and when the two elements are evenly 
<A NAME="811"></A>balanced, what is done seems neither painful nor pleasant; for if the nature 
<A NAME="812"></A>of anything were simple, the same action would always be most pleasant 
<A NAME="813"></A>to it. This is why God always enjoys a single and simple pleasure; for 
<A NAME="814"></A>there is not only an activity of movement but an activity of immobility, 
<A NAME="815"></A>and pleasure is found more in rest than in movement. But 'change in all 
<A NAME="816"></A>things is sweet', as the poet says, because of some vice; for as it is 
<A NAME="817"></A>the vicious man that is changeable, so the nature that needs change is 
<A NAME="818"></A>vicious; for it is not simple nor good.
<A NAME="819"></A><BR><BR>We have now discussed continence and incontinence, and pleasure 
<A NAME="820"></A>and pain, both what each is and in what sense some of them are good and 
<A NAME="821"></A>others bad; it remains to speak of friendship.
