<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>We have explained under what conditions 'combination', 'contact', and 'action-passion' 
<A NAME="12"></A>are attributable to the things which undergo natural change. Further, we 
<A NAME="13"></A>have discussed 'unqualified' coming-to-be and passing-away, and explained 
<A NAME="14"></A>under what conditions they are predicable, of what subject, and owing to 
<A NAME="15"></A>what cause. Similarly, we have also discussed 'alteration', and explained 
<A NAME="16"></A>what 'altering' is and how it differs from coming-to-be and passing-away. 
<A NAME="17"></A>But we have still to investigate the so-called 'elements' of 
<A NAME="18"></A>bodies.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>For the complex substances whose formation and maintenance are 
<A NAME="20"></A>due to natural processes all presuppose the perceptible bodies as the condition 
<A NAME="21"></A>of their coming-to-be and passing-away: but philosophers disagree in regard 
<A NAME="22"></A>to the matter which underlies these perceptible bodies. Some maintain it 
<A NAME="23"></A>is single, supposing it to be, e.g. Air or Fire, or an 'intermediate' between 
<A NAME="24"></A>these two (but still a body with a separate existence). Others, on the 
<A NAME="25"></A>contrary, postulate two or more materials-ascribing to their 'association' 
<A NAME="26"></A>and 'dissociation', or to their 'alteration', the coming-to-be and passing-away 
<A NAME="27"></A>of things. (Some, for instance, postulate Fire and Earth: some add Air, 
<A NAME="28"></A>making three: and some, like Empedocles, reckon Water as well, thus postulating 
<A NAME="29"></A>four.)
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Now we may agree that the primary materials, whose change (whether 
<A NAME="31"></A>it be 'association and dissociation' or a process of another kind) results 
<A NAME="32"></A>in coming-to-be and passingaway, are rightly described as 'originative 
<A NAME="33"></A>sources, i.e. elements'. But (i) those thinkers are in error who postulate, 
<A NAME="34"></A>beside the bodies we have mentioned, a single matter-and that corporeal 
<A NAME="35"></A>and separable matter. For this 'body' of theirs cannot possibly exist without 
<A NAME="36"></A>a 'perceptible contrariety': this 'Boundless', which some thinkers identify 
<A NAME="37"></A>with the 'original real', must be either light or heavy, either cold or 
<A NAME="38"></A>hot. And (ii) what Plato has written in the Timaeus is not based on any 
<A NAME="39"></A>precisely-articulated conception. For he has not stated clearly whether 
<A NAME="40"></A>his 'Omnirecipient" exists in separation from the 'elements'; nor does 
<A NAME="41"></A>he make any use of it. He says, indeed, that it is a substratum prior to 
<A NAME="42"></A>the so-called 'elements'-underlying them, as gold underlies the things 
<A NAME="43"></A>that are fashioned of gold. (And yet this comparison, if thus expressed, 
<A NAME="44"></A>is itself open to criticism. Things which come-to-be and pass-away cannot 
<A NAME="45"></A>be called by the name of the material out of which they have come-tobe: 
<A NAME="46"></A>it is only the results of 'alteration' which retain the name of the substratum 
<A NAME="47"></A>whose 'alterations' they are. However, he actually says' that the truest 
<A NAME="48"></A>account is to affirm that each of them is "gold"'.) Nevertheless he carries 
<A NAME="49"></A>his analysis of the 'elements'-solids though they are-back to 'planes', 
<A NAME="50"></A>and it is impossible for 'the Nurse' (i.e. the primary matter) to be identical 
<A NAME="51"></A>with 'the planes'.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>Our own doctrine is that although there is a matter of the perceptible 
<A NAME="53"></A>bodies (a matter out of which the so-called 'clements' come-to-be), it 
<A NAME="54"></A>has no separate existence, but is always bound up with a contrariety. A 
<A NAME="55"></A>more precise account of these presuppositions has been given in another 
<A NAME="56"></A>work': we must, however, give a detailed explanation of the primary bodies 
<A NAME="57"></A>as well, since they too are similarly derived from the matter. We must 
<A NAME="58"></A>reckon as an 'originative source' and as 'primary' the matter which underlies, 
<A NAME="59"></A>though it is inseparable from, the contrary qualities: for the hot' is 
<A NAME="60"></A>not matter for 'the cold' nor 'the cold' for 'the hot', but the substratum 
<A NAME="61"></A>is matter for them both. We therefore have to recognize three 'originative 
<A NAME="62"></A>sources': firstly that which potentially perceptible body, secondly the 
<A NAME="63"></A>contrarieties (I mean, e.g. heat and cold), and thirdly Fire, Water, and 
<A NAME="64"></A>the like. Only 'thirdly', however: for these bodies change into one another 
<A NAME="65"></A>(they are not immutable as Empedocles and other thinkers assert, since 
<A NAME="66"></A>'alteration' would then have been impossible), whereas the contrarieties 
<A NAME="67"></A>do not change.
<A NAME="68"></A><BR><BR>Nevertheless, even so the question remains: What sorts of contrarieties, 
<A NAME="69"></A>and how many of them, are to be accounted 'originative sources' of body? 
<A NAME="70"></A>For all the other thinkers assume and use them without explaining why they 
<A NAME="71"></A>are these or why they are just so many.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="72"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Since, then, we are looking for 'originative sources' of perceptible 
<A NAME="74"></A>body; and since 'perceptible' is equivalent to 'tangible', and 'tangible' 
<A NAME="75"></A>is that of which the perception is touch; it is clear that not all the 
<A NAME="76"></A>contrarieties constitute 'forms' and 'originative sources' of body, but 
<A NAME="77"></A>only those which correspond to touch. For it is in accordance with a contrariety-a 
<A NAME="78"></A>contrariety, moreover, of tangible qualities-that the primary bodies are 
<A NAME="79"></A>differentiated. That is why neither whiteness (and blackness), nor sweetness 
<A NAME="80"></A>(and bitterness), nor (similarly) any quality belonging to the other perceptible 
<A NAME="81"></A>contrarieties either, constitutes an 'element'. And yet vision is prior 
<A NAME="82"></A>to touch, so that its object also is prior to the object of touch. The 
<A NAME="83"></A>object of vision, however, is a quality of tangible body not qua tangible, 
<A NAME="84"></A>but qua something else-qua something which may well be naturally prior 
<A NAME="85"></A>to the object of touch.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly, we must segregate the tangible differences and contrarieties, 
<A NAME="87"></A>and distinguish which amongst them are primary. Contrarieties correlative 
<A NAME="88"></A>to touch are the following: hot-cold, dry-moist, heavy-light, hard-soft, 
<A NAME="89"></A>viscous-brittle, rough-smooth, coarse-fine. Of these (i) heavy and light 
<A NAME="90"></A>are neither active nor susceptible. Things are not called 'heavy' and 'light' 
<A NAME="91"></A>because they act upon, or suffer action from, other things. But the 'elements' 
<A NAME="92"></A>must be reciprocally active and susceptible, since they 'combine' and are 
<A NAME="93"></A>transformed into one another. On the other hand (ii) hot and cold, and 
<A NAME="94"></A>dry and moist, are terms, of which the first pair implies power to act 
<A NAME="95"></A>and the second pair susceptibility. 'Hot' is that which 'associates' things 
<A NAME="96"></A>of the same kind (for 'dissociating', which people attribute to Fire as 
<A NAME="97"></A>its function, is 'associating' things of the same class, since its effect 
<A NAME="98"></A>is to eliminate what is foreign), while 'cold' is that which brings together, 
<A NAME="99"></A>i.e. 'associates', homogeneous and heterogeneous things alike. And moise 
<A NAME="100"></A>is that which, being readily adaptable in shape, is not determinable by 
<A NAME="101"></A>any limit of its own: while 'dry' is that which is readily determinable 
<A NAME="102"></A>by its own limit, but not readily adaptable in shape.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>From moist and dry are derived (iii) the fine and coarse, viscous 
<A NAME="104"></A>and brittle, hard and soft, and the remaining tangible differences. For 
<A NAME="105"></A>(a) since the moist has no determinate shape, but is readily adaptable 
<A NAME="106"></A>and follows the outline of that which is in contact with it, it is characteristic 
<A NAME="107"></A>of it to be 'such as to fill up'. Now 'the fine' is 'such as to fill up'. 
<A NAME="108"></A>For the fine' consists of subtle particles; but that which consists of 
<A NAME="109"></A>small particles is 'such as to fill up', inasmuch as it is in contact whole 
<A NAME="110"></A>with whole-and 'the fine' exhibits this character in a superlative degree. 
<A NAME="111"></A>Hence it is evident that the fine derives from the moist, while the coarse 
<A NAME="112"></A>derives from the dry. Again (b) the viscous' derives from the moist: for 
<A NAME="113"></A>'the viscous' (e.g. oil) is a 'moist' modified in a certain way. 'The brittle', 
<A NAME="114"></A>on the other hand, derives from the dry: for 'brittle' is that which is 
<A NAME="115"></A>completely dry-so completely, that its solidification has actually been 
<A NAME="116"></A>due to failure of moisture. Further (c) 'the soft' derives from the moist. 
<A NAME="117"></A>For 'soft' is that which yields to pressure by retiring into itself, though 
<A NAME="118"></A>it does not yield by total displacement as the moist does-which explains 
<A NAME="119"></A>why the moist is not 'soft', although 'the soft' derives from the moist. 
<A NAME="120"></A>'The hard', on the other hand, derives from the dry: for 'hard' is that 
<A NAME="121"></A>which is solidified, and the solidified is dry.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>The terms 'dry' and 'moist' have more senses than one. For 'the 
<A NAME="123"></A>damp', as well as the moist, is opposed to the dry: and again 'the solidified', 
<A NAME="124"></A>as well as the dry, is opposed to the moist. But all these qualities derive 
<A NAME="125"></A>from the dry and moist we mentioned first.' For (i) the dry is opposed 
<A NAME="126"></A>to the damp: i.e. 'damp' is that which has foreign moisture on its surface 
<A NAME="127"></A>('sodden' being that which is penetrated to its core), while 'dry' is that 
<A NAME="128"></A>which has lost foreign moisture. Hence it is evident that the damp will 
<A NAME="129"></A>derive from the moist, and 'the dry' which is opposed to it will derive 
<A NAME="130"></A>from the primary dry. Again (ii) the 'moist' and the solidified derive 
<A NAME="131"></A>in the same way from the primary pair. For 'moist' is that which contains 
<A NAME="132"></A>moisture of its-own deep within it ('sodden' being that which is deeply 
<A NAME="133"></A>penetrated by foreign mosture), whereas 'solidigied' is that which has 
<A NAME="134"></A>lost this inner moisture. Hence these too derive from the primary pair, 
<A NAME="135"></A>the 'solidified' from the dry and the 'solidified' from the dry the 'liquefiable' 
<A NAME="136"></A>from the moist.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>It is clear, then, that all the other differences reduce to the 
<A NAME="138"></A>first four, but that these admit of no further reduction. For the hot is 
<A NAME="139"></A>not essentially moist or dry, nor the moist essentially hot or cold: nor 
<A NAME="140"></A>are the cold and the dry derivative forms, either of one another or of 
<A NAME="141"></A>the hot and the moist. Hence these must be four.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="142"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>The elementary qualities are four, and any four terms can be combined 
<A NAME="144"></A>in six couples. Contraries, however, refuse to be coupled: for it is impossible 
<A NAME="145"></A>for the same thing to be hot and cold, or moist and dry. Hence it is evident 
<A NAME="146"></A>that the 'couplings' of the elementary qualities will be four: hot with 
<A NAME="147"></A>dry and moist with hot, and again cold with dry and cold with moist. And 
<A NAME="148"></A>these four couples have attached themselves to the apparently 'simple' 
<A NAME="149"></A>bodies (Fire, Air, Water, and Earth) in a manner consonant with theory. 
<A NAME="150"></A>For Fire is hot and dry, whereas Air is hot and moist (Air being a sort 
<A NAME="151"></A>of aqueous vapour); and Water is cold and moist, while Earth is cold and 
<A NAME="152"></A>dry. Thus the differences are reasonably distributed among the primary 
<A NAME="153"></A>bodies, and the number of the latter is consonant with theory. For all 
<A NAME="154"></A>who make the simple bodies 'elements' postulate either one, or two, or 
<A NAME="155"></A>three, or four. Now (i) those who assert there is one only, and then generate 
<A NAME="156"></A>everything else by condensation and rarefaction, are in effect making their 
<A NAME="157"></A>'originative sources' two, viz. the rare and the dense, or rather the hot 
<A NAME="158"></A>and the cold: for it is these which are the moulding forces, while the 
<A NAME="159"></A>'one' underlies them as a 'matter'. But (ii) those who postulate two from 
<A NAME="160"></A>the start-as Parmenides postulated Fire and Earth-make the intermediates 
<A NAME="161"></A>(e.g. Air and Water) blends of these. The same course is followed (iii) 
<A NAME="162"></A>by those who advocate three. (We may compare what Plato does in Me Divisions': 
<A NAME="163"></A>for he makes 'the middle' a blend.) Indeed, there is practically no difference 
<A NAME="164"></A>between those who postulate two and those who postulate three, except that 
<A NAME="165"></A>the former split the middle 'element' into two, while the latter treat 
<A NAME="166"></A>it as only one. But (iv) some advocate four from the start, e.g. Empedocles: 
<A NAME="167"></A>yet he too draws them together so as to reduce them to the two, for he 
<A NAME="168"></A>opposes all the others to Fire.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>In fact, however, fire and air, and each of the bodies we have 
<A NAME="170"></A>mentioned, are not simple, but blended. The 'simple' bodies are indeed 
<A NAME="171"></A>similar in nature to them, but not identical with them. Thus the 'simple' 
<A NAME="172"></A>body corresponding to fire is 'such-as-fire, not fire: that which corresponds 
<A NAME="173"></A>to air is 'such-as-air': and so on with the rest of them. But fire is an 
<A NAME="174"></A>excess of heat, just as ice is an excess of cold. For freezing and boiling 
<A NAME="175"></A>are excesses of heat and cold respectively. Assuming, therefore, that ice 
<A NAME="176"></A>is a freezing of moist and cold, fire analogously will be a boiling of 
<A NAME="177"></A>dry and hot: a fact, by the way, which explains why nothing comes-to-be 
<A NAME="178"></A>either out of ice or out of fire.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>The 'simple' bodies, since they are four, fall into two pairs which 
<A NAME="180"></A>belong to the two regions, each to each: for Fire and Air are forms of 
<A NAME="181"></A>the body moving towards the 'limit', while Earth and Water are forms of 
<A NAME="182"></A>the body which moves towards the 'centre'. Fire and Earth, moreover, are 
<A NAME="183"></A>extremes and purest: Water and Air, on the contrary are intermediates and 
<A NAME="184"></A>more like blends. And, further, the members of either pair are contrary 
<A NAME="185"></A>to those of the other, Water being contrary to Fire and Earth to Air; for 
<A NAME="186"></A>the qualities constituting Water and Earth are contrary to those that constitute 
<A NAME="187"></A>Fire and Air. Nevertheless, since they are four, each of them is characterized 
<A NAME="188"></A>par excellence a single quality: Earth by dry rather than by cold, Water 
<A NAME="189"></A>by cold rather than by moist, Air by moist rather than by hot, and Fire 
<A NAME="190"></A>by hot rather than by dry.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="191"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>It has been established before' that the coming-to-be of the 'simple' 
<A NAME="193"></A>bodies is reciprocal. At the same time, it is manifest, even on the evidence 
<A NAME="194"></A>of perception, that they do come-to-be: for otherwise there would not have 
<A NAME="195"></A>been 'alteration, since 'alteration' is change in respect to the qualities 
<A NAME="196"></A>of the objects of touch. Consequently, we must explain (i) what is the 
<A NAME="197"></A>manner of their reciprocal transformation, and (ii) whether every one of 
<A NAME="198"></A>them can come to-be out of every one-or whether some can do so, but not 
<A NAME="199"></A>others.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>Now it is evident that all of them are by nature such as to change 
<A NAME="201"></A>into one another: for coming-to-be is a change into contraries and out 
<A NAME="202"></A>of contraries, and the 'elements' all involve a contrariety in their mutual 
<A NAME="203"></A>relations because their distinctive qualities are contrary. For in some 
<A NAME="204"></A>of them both qualities are contrary-e.g. in Fire and Water, the first of 
<A NAME="205"></A>these being dry and hot, and the second moist and cold: while in others 
<A NAME="206"></A>one of the qualities (though only one) is contrary-e.g. in Air and Water, 
<A NAME="207"></A>the first being moist and hot, and the second moist and cold. It is evident, 
<A NAME="208"></A>therefore, if we consider them in general, that every one is by nature 
<A NAME="209"></A>such as to come-to-be out of every one: and when we come to consider them 
<A NAME="210"></A>severally, it is not difficult to see the manner in which their transformation 
<A NAME="211"></A>is effected. For, though all will result from all, both the speed and the 
<A NAME="212"></A>facility of their conversion will differ in degree.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>Thus (i) the process of conversion will be quick between those 
<A NAME="214"></A>which have interchangeable 'complementary factors', but slow between those 
<A NAME="215"></A>which have none. The reason is that it is easier for a single thing to 
<A NAME="216"></A>change than for many. Air, e.g. will result from Fire if a single quality 
<A NAME="217"></A>changes: for Fire, as we saw, is hot and dry while Air is hot and moist, 
<A NAME="218"></A>so that there will be Air if the dry be overcome by the moist. Again, Water 
<A NAME="219"></A>will result from Air if the hot be overcome by the cold: for Air, as we 
<A NAME="220"></A>saw, is hot and moist while Water is cold and moist, so that, if the hot 
<A NAME="221"></A>changes, there will be Water. So too, in the same manner, Earth will result 
<A NAME="222"></A>from Water and Fire from Earth, since the two 'elements' in both these 
<A NAME="223"></A>couples have interchangeable 'complementary factors'. For Water is moist 
<A NAME="224"></A>and cold while Earth is cold and dry-so that, if the moist be overcome, 
<A NAME="225"></A>there will be Earth: and again, since Fire is dry and hot while Earth is 
<A NAME="226"></A>cold and dry, Fire will result from Earth if the cold 
<A NAME="227"></A>pass-away.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>It is evident, therefore, that the coming-to-be of the 'simple' 
<A NAME="229"></A>bodies will be cyclical; and that this cyclical method of transformation 
<A NAME="230"></A>is the easiest, because the consecutive 'clements' contain interchangeable 
<A NAME="231"></A>'complementary factors'. On the other hand (ii) the transformation of Fire 
<A NAME="232"></A>into Water and of Air into Earth, and again of Water and Earth into Fire 
<A NAME="233"></A>and Air respectively, though possible, is more difficult because it involves 
<A NAME="234"></A>the change of more qualities. For if Fire is to result from Water, both 
<A NAME="235"></A>the cold and the moist must pass-away: and again, both the cold and the 
<A NAME="236"></A>dry must pass-away if Air is to result from Earth. So' too, if Water and 
<A NAME="237"></A>Earth are to result from Fire and Air respectively-both qualities must 
<A NAME="238"></A>change.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>This second method of coming-to-be, then, takes a longer time. 
<A NAME="240"></A>But (iii) if one quality in each of two 'elements' pass-away, the transformation, 
<A NAME="241"></A>though easier, is not reciprocal. Still, from Fire plus Water there will 
<A NAME="242"></A>result Earth and Air, and from Air plus Earth Fire and Water. For there 
<A NAME="243"></A>will be Air, when the cold of the Water and the dry of the Fire have passed-away 
<A NAME="244"></A>(since the hot of the latter and the moist of the former are left): whereas, 
<A NAME="245"></A>when the hot of the Fire and the moist of the Water have passed-away, there 
<A NAME="246"></A>will be Earth, owing to the survival of the dry of the Fire and the cold 
<A NAME="247"></A>of the Water. So, too, in the same Way, Fire and Water will result from 
<A NAME="248"></A>Air plus Earth. For there will be Water, when the hot of the Air and the 
<A NAME="249"></A>dry of the Earth have passed-away (since the moist of the former and the 
<A NAME="250"></A>cold of the latter are left): whereas, when the moist of the Air and the 
<A NAME="251"></A>cold of the Earth have passed-away, there will be Fire, owing to the survival 
<A NAME="252"></A>of the hot of the Air and the dry of the Earth-qualities essentially constitutive 
<A NAME="253"></A>of Fire. Moreover, this mode of Fire's coming-to-be is confirmed by perception. 
<A NAME="254"></A>For flame is par excellence Fire: but flame is burning smoke, and smoke 
<A NAME="255"></A>consists of Air and Earth.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>No transformation, however, into any of the 'simple' bodies can 
<A NAME="257"></A>result from the passingaway of one elementary quality in each of two 'elements' 
<A NAME="258"></A>when they are taken in their consecutive order, because either identical 
<A NAME="259"></A>or contrary qualities are left in the pair: but no 'simple' body can be 
<A NAME="260"></A>formed either out of identical, or out of contrary, qualities. Thus no 
<A NAME="261"></A>'simple' body would result, if the dry of Fire and the moist of Air were 
<A NAME="262"></A>to pass-away: for the hot is left in both. On the other hand, if the hot 
<A NAME="263"></A>pass-away out both, the contraries-dry and moist-are left. A similar result 
<A NAME="264"></A>will occur in all the others too: for all the consecutive 'elements' contain 
<A NAME="265"></A>one identical, and one contrary, quality. Hence, too, it clearly follows 
<A NAME="266"></A>that, when one of the consecutive 'elements' is transformed into one, the 
<A NAME="267"></A>coming-to-be is effected by the passing-away of a single quality: whereas, 
<A NAME="268"></A>when two of them are transformed into a third, more than one quality must 
<A NAME="269"></A>have passedaway.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>We have stated that all the 'elements' come-to-be out of any one 
<A NAME="271"></A>of them; and we have explained the manner in which their mutual conversion 
<A NAME="272"></A>takes place. Let us nevertheless supplement our theory by the following 
<A NAME="273"></A>speculations concerning them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="274"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>If Water, Air, and the like are a 'matter' of which the natural 
<A NAME="276"></A>bodies consist, as some thinkers in fact believe, these 'clements' must 
<A NAME="277"></A>be either one, or two, or more. Now they cannot all of them be one-they 
<A NAME="278"></A>cannot, e.g. all be Air or Water or Fire or Earth-because 'Change is into 
<A NAME="279"></A>contraries'. For if they all were Air, then (assuming Air to persist) there 
<A NAME="280"></A>will be 'alteration' instead of coming-to-be. Besides, nobody supposes 
<A NAME="281"></A>a single 'element' to persist, as the basis of all, in such a way that 
<A NAME="282"></A>it is Water as well as Air (or any other 'element') at the same time. So 
<A NAME="283"></A>there will be a certain contrariety, i.e. a differentiating quality: and 
<A NAME="284"></A>the other member of this contrariety, e.g. heat, will belong to some other 
<A NAME="285"></A>'element', e.g. to Fire. But Fire will certainly not be 'hot Air'. For 
<A NAME="286"></A>a change of that kind (a) is 'alteration', and (b) is not what is observed. 
<A NAME="287"></A>Moreover (c) if Air is again to result out of the Fire, it will do so by 
<A NAME="288"></A>the conversion of the hot into its contrary: this contrary, therefore, 
<A NAME="289"></A>will belong to Air, and Air will be a cold something: hence it is impossible 
<A NAME="290"></A>for Fire to be 'hot Air', since in that case the same thing will be simultaneously 
<A NAME="291"></A>hot and cold. Both Fire and Air, therefore, will be something else which 
<A NAME="292"></A>is the same; i.e. there will be some 'matter', other than either, common 
<A NAME="293"></A>to both.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>The same argument applies to all the 'elements', proving that there 
<A NAME="295"></A>is no single one of them out of which they all originate. But neither is 
<A NAME="296"></A>there, beside these four, some other body from which they originate-a something 
<A NAME="297"></A>intermediate, e.g. between Air and Water (coarser than Air, but finer than 
<A NAME="298"></A>Water), or between Air and Fire (coarser than Fire, but finer than Air). 
<A NAME="299"></A>For the supposed 'intermediate' will be Air and Fire when a pair of contrasted 
<A NAME="300"></A>qualities is added to it: but, since one of every two contrary qualities 
<A NAME="301"></A>is a 'privation', the 'intermediate' never can exist-as some thinkers assert 
<A NAME="302"></A>the 'Boundless' or the 'Environing' exists-in isolation. It is, therefore, 
<A NAME="303"></A>equally and indifferently any one of the 'elements', or else it is 
<A NAME="304"></A>nothing.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>Since, then, there is nothing-at least, nothing perceptible-prior 
<A NAME="306"></A>to these, they must be all. That being so, either they must always persist 
<A NAME="307"></A>and not be transformable into one another: or they must undergo transformation-either 
<A NAME="308"></A>all of them, or some only (as Plato wrote in the Timacus).' Now it has 
<A NAME="309"></A>been proved before that they must undergo reciprocal transformation. It 
<A NAME="310"></A>has also been proved that the speed with which they come-to-be, one out 
<A NAME="311"></A>of another, is not uniform-since the process of reciprocal transformation 
<A NAME="312"></A>is relatively quick between the 'elements' with a 'complementary factor', 
<A NAME="313"></A>but relatively slow between those which possess no such factor. Assuming, 
<A NAME="314"></A>then, that the contrariety, in respect to which they are transformed, is 
<A NAME="315"></A>one, the elements' will inevitably be two: for it is 'matter' that is the 
<A NAME="316"></A>'mean' between the two contraries, and matter is imperceptible and inseparable 
<A NAME="317"></A>from them. Since, however, the 'elements' are seen to be more than two, 
<A NAME="318"></A>the contrarieties must at the least be two. But the contrarieties being 
<A NAME="319"></A>two, the 'elements' must be four (as they evidently are) and cannot be 
<A NAME="320"></A>three: for the couplings' are four, since, though six are possible, the 
<A NAME="321"></A>two in which the qualities are contrary to one another cannot 
<A NAME="322"></A>occur.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>These subjects have been discussed before:' but the following arguments 
<A NAME="324"></A>will make it clear that, since the 'elements' are transformed into one 
<A NAME="325"></A>another, it is impossible for any one of them-whether it be at the end 
<A NAME="326"></A>or in the middle-to be an 'originative source' of the rest. There can be 
<A NAME="327"></A>no such 'originative element' at the ends: for all of them would then be 
<A NAME="328"></A>Fire or Earth, and this theory amounts to the assertion that all things 
<A NAME="329"></A>are made of Fire or Earth. Nor can a 'middle-element' be such an originative 
<A NAME="330"></A>source'-as some thinkers suppose that Air is transformed both into Fire 
<A NAME="331"></A>and into Water, and Water both into Air and into Earth, while the 'end-elements' 
<A NAME="332"></A>are not further transformed into one another. For the process must come 
<A NAME="333"></A>to a stop, and cannot continue ad infinitum in a straight line in either 
<A NAME="334"></A>direction, since otherwise an infinite number of contrarieties would attach 
<A NAME="335"></A>to the single 'element'. Let E stand for Earth, W for Water, A for Air, 
<A NAME="336"></A>and F for Fire. Then (i) since A is transformed into F and W, there will 
<A NAME="337"></A>be a contrariety belonging to A F. Let these contraries be whiteness and 
<A NAME="338"></A>blackness. Again (ii) since A is transformed into W, there will be another 
<A NAME="339"></A>contrariety: for W is not the same as F. Let this second contrariety be 
<A NAME="340"></A>dryness and moistness, D being dryness and M moistness. Now if, when A 
<A NAME="341"></A>is transformed into W, the 'white' persists, Water will be moist and white: 
<A NAME="342"></A>but if it does not persist, Water will be black since change is into contraries. 
<A NAME="343"></A>Water, therefore, must be either white or black. Let it then be the first. 
<A NAME="344"></A>On similar grounds, therefore, D (dryness) will also belong to F. Consequently 
<A NAME="345"></A>F (Fire) as well as Air will be able to be transformed into Water: for 
<A NAME="346"></A>it has qualities contrary to those of Water, since Fire was first taken 
<A NAME="347"></A>to be black and then to be dry, while Water was moist and then showed itself 
<A NAME="348"></A>white. Thus it is evident that all the 'elements' will be able to be transformed 
<A NAME="349"></A>out of one another; and that, in the instances we have taken, E (Earth) 
<A NAME="350"></A>also will contain the remaining two 'complementary factors', viz. the black 
<A NAME="351"></A>and the moist (for these have not yet been coupled).
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>We have dealt with this last topic before the thesis we set out 
<A NAME="353"></A>to prove. That thesis-viz. that the process cannot continue ad infinitum-will 
<A NAME="354"></A>be clear from the following considerations. If Fire (which is represented 
<A NAME="355"></A>by F) is not to revert, but is to be transformed in turn into some other 
<A NAME="356"></A>'element' (e.g. into Q), a new contrariety, other than those mentioned, 
<A NAME="357"></A>will belong to Fire and Q: for it has been assumed that Q is not the same 
<A NAME="358"></A>as any of the four, E W A and F. Let K, then, belong to F and Y to Q. Then 
<A NAME="359"></A>K will belong to all four, E W A and F: for they are transformed into one 
<A NAME="360"></A>another. This last point, however, we may admit, has not yet been proved: 
<A NAME="361"></A>but at any rate it is clear that if Q is to be transformed in turn into 
<A NAME="362"></A>yet another 'element', yet another contrariety will belong not only to 
<A NAME="363"></A>Q but also to F (Fire). And, similarly, every addition of a new 'element' 
<A NAME="364"></A>will carry with it the attachment of a new contrariety to the preceding 
<A NAME="365"></A>elements'. Consequently, if the 'elements' are infinitely many, there will 
<A NAME="366"></A>also belong to the single 'element' an infinite number of contrarieties. 
<A NAME="367"></A>But if that be so, it will be impossible to define any 'element': impossible 
<A NAME="368"></A>also for any to come-to-be. For if one is to result from another, it will 
<A NAME="369"></A>have to pass through such a vast number of contrarieties-and indeed even 
<A NAME="370"></A>more than any determinate number. Consequently (i) into some 'elements' 
<A NAME="371"></A>transformation will never be effected-viz. if the intermediates are infinite 
<A NAME="372"></A>in number, as they must be if the 'elements' are infinitely many: further 
<A NAME="373"></A>(ii) there will not even be a transformation of Air into Fire, if the contrarieties 
<A NAME="374"></A>are infinitely many: moreover (iii) all the 'elements' become one. For 
<A NAME="375"></A>all the contrarieties of the 'elements' above F must belong to those below 
<A NAME="376"></A>F, and vice versa: hence they will all be one.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="377"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>As for those who agree with Empedocles that the 'elements' of body 
<A NAME="379"></A>are more than one, so that they are not transformed into one another-one 
<A NAME="380"></A>may well wonder in what sense it is open to them to maintain that the 'elements' 
<A NAME="381"></A>are comparable. Yet Empedocles says 'For these are all not only 
<A NAME="382"></A>equal...'
<A NAME="383"></A><BR><BR>If it is meant that they are comparable in their amount, all the 
<A NAME="384"></A>'comparables' must possess an identical something whereby they are measured. 
<A NAME="385"></A>If, e.g. one pint of Water yields ten of Air, both are measured by the 
<A NAME="386"></A>same unit; and therefore both were from the first an identical something. 
<A NAME="387"></A>On the other hand, suppose (ii) they are not 'comparable in their amount' 
<A NAME="388"></A>in the sense that so-much of the one yields so much of the other, but comparable 
<A NAME="389"></A>in 'power of action (a pint of Water, e.g. having a power of cooling equal 
<A NAME="390"></A>to that of ten pints of Air); even so, they are 'comparable in their amount', 
<A NAME="391"></A>though not qua 'amount' but qua Iso-much power'. There is also (iii) a 
<A NAME="392"></A>third possibility. Instead of comparing their powers by the measure of 
<A NAME="393"></A>their amount, they might be compared as terms in a 'correspondence': e.g. 
<A NAME="394"></A>'as x is hot, so correspondingly y is white'. But 'correspondence', though 
<A NAME="395"></A>it means equality in the quantum, means similarity in a quale. Thus it 
<A NAME="396"></A>is manifestly absurd that the 'simple' bodies, though they are not transformable, 
<A NAME="397"></A>are comparable not merely as 'corresponding', but by a measure of their 
<A NAME="398"></A>powers; i.e. that so-much Fire is comparable with many times-that-amount 
<A NAME="399"></A>of Air, as being 'equally' or 'similarly' hot. For the same thing, if it 
<A NAME="400"></A>be greater in amount, will, since it belongs to the same kind, have its 
<A NAME="401"></A>ratio correspondingly increased.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>A further objection to the theory of Empedocles is that it makes 
<A NAME="403"></A>even growth impossible, unless it be increase by addition. For his Fire 
<A NAME="404"></A>increases by Fire: 'And Earth increases its own frame and Ether increases 
<A NAME="405"></A>Ether." These, however, are cases of addition: but it is not by addition 
<A NAME="406"></A>that growing things are believed to increase. And it is far more difficult 
<A NAME="407"></A>for him to account for the coming-to-be which occurs in nature. For the 
<A NAME="408"></A>things which come-to-be by natural process all exhibit, in their coming-to-be, 
<A NAME="409"></A>a uniformity either absolute or highly regular: while any exceptions any 
<A NAME="410"></A>results which are in accordance neither with the invariable nor with the 
<A NAME="411"></A>general rule are products of chance and luck. Then what is the cause determining 
<A NAME="412"></A>that man comes-to-be from man, that wheat (instead of an olive) comes-to-be 
<A NAME="413"></A>from wheat, either invariably or generally? Are we to say 'Bone comes-to-be 
<A NAME="414"></A>if the "elements" be put together in such-and such a manner'? For, according 
<A NAME="415"></A>to his own estatements, nothing comes-to-be from their 'fortuitous consilience', 
<A NAME="416"></A>but only from their 'consilience' in a certain proportion. What, then, 
<A NAME="417"></A>is the cause of this proportional consilience? Presumably not Fire or Earth. 
<A NAME="418"></A>But neither is it Love and Strife: for the former is a cause of 'association' 
<A NAME="419"></A>only, and the latter only of 'dissociation'. No: the cause in question 
<A NAME="420"></A>is the essential nature of each thing-not merely to quote his words) 'a 
<A NAME="421"></A>mingling and a divorce of what has been mingled'. And chance, not proportion, 
<A NAME="422"></A>'is the name given to these occurrences': for things can be 'mingled' 
<A NAME="423"></A>fortuitously.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>The cause, therefore, of the coming-to-be of the things which owe 
<A NAME="425"></A>their existence to nature is that they are in such-and-such a determinate 
<A NAME="426"></A>condition: and it is this which constitutes, the 'nature' of each thing-a 
<A NAME="427"></A>'nature' about which he says nothing. What he says, therefore, is no explanation 
<A NAME="428"></A>of 'nature'. Moreover, it is this which is both 'the excellence' of each 
<A NAME="429"></A>thing and its 'good': whereas he assigns the whole credit to the 'mingling'. 
<A NAME="430"></A>(And yet the 'elements' at all events are 'dissociated' not by Strife, 
<A NAME="431"></A>but by Love: since the 'elements' are by nature prior to the Deity, and 
<A NAME="432"></A>they too are Deities.)
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>Again, his account of motion is vague. For it is not an adequate 
<A NAME="434"></A>explanation to say that 'Love and Strife set things moving, unless the 
<A NAME="435"></A>very nature of Love is a movement of this kind and the very nature of Strife 
<A NAME="436"></A>a movement of that kind. He ought, then, either to have defined or to have 
<A NAME="437"></A>postulated these characteristic movements, or to have demonstrated them-whether 
<A NAME="438"></A>strictly or laxly or in some other fashion. Moreover, since (a) the 'simple' 
<A NAME="439"></A>bodies appear to move 'naturally' as well as by compulsion, i.e. in a manner 
<A NAME="440"></A>contrary to nature (fire, e.g. appears to move upwards without compulsion, 
<A NAME="441"></A>though it appears to move by compulsion downwards); and since (b) what 
<A NAME="442"></A>is 'natural' is contrary to that which is due to compulsion, and movement 
<A NAME="443"></A>by compulsion actually occurs; it follows that 'natural movement' can also 
<A NAME="444"></A>occur in fact. Is this, then, the movement that Love sets going? No: for, 
<A NAME="445"></A>on the contrary, the 'natural movement' moves Earth downwards and resembles 
<A NAME="446"></A>'dissociation', and Strife rather than Love is its cause-so that in general, 
<A NAME="447"></A>too, Love rather than Strife would seem to be contrary to nature. And unless 
<A NAME="448"></A>Love or Strife is actually setting them in motion, the 'simple' bodies 
<A NAME="449"></A>themselves have absolutely no movement or rest. But this is paradoxical: 
<A NAME="450"></A>and what is more, they do in fact obviously move. For though Strife 'dissociated', 
<A NAME="451"></A>it was not by Strife that the 'Ether' was borne upwards. On the contrary, 
<A NAME="452"></A>sometimes he attributes its movement to something like chance ('For thus, 
<A NAME="453"></A>as it ran, it happened to meet them then, though often otherwise"), while 
<A NAME="454"></A>at other times he says it is the nature of Fire to be borne upwards, but 
<A NAME="455"></A>'the Ether' (to quote his words) 'sank down upon the Earth with long roots'. 
<A NAME="456"></A>With such statements, too, he combines the assertion that the Order of 
<A NAME="457"></A>the World is the same now, in the reign of Strife, as it was formerly in 
<A NAME="458"></A>the reign of Love. What, then, is the 'first mover' of the 'elements'? 
<A NAME="459"></A>What causes their motion? Presumably not Love and Strife: on the contrary, 
<A NAME="460"></A>these are causes of a particular motion, if at least we assume that 'first 
<A NAME="461"></A>mover' to be an originative source'.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR>An additional paradox is that the soul should consist of the 'elements', 
<A NAME="463"></A>or that it should be one of them. How are the soul's 'alterations' to take 
<A NAME="464"></A>Place? How, e.g. is the change from being musical to being unmusical, or 
<A NAME="465"></A>how is memory or forgetting, to occur? For clearly, if the soul be Fire, 
<A NAME="466"></A>only such modifications will happen to it as characterize Fire qua Fire: 
<A NAME="467"></A>while if it be compounded out of the elements', only the corporeal modifications 
<A NAME="468"></A>will occur in it. But the changes we have mentioned are none of them 
<A NAME="469"></A>corporeal.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="470"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>The discussion of these difficulties, however, is a task appropriate 
<A NAME="472"></A>to a different investigation:' let us return to the 'elements' of which 
<A NAME="473"></A>bodies are composed. The theories that 'there is something common to all 
<A NAME="474"></A>the "elements"', and that they are reciprocally transformed', are so related 
<A NAME="475"></A>that those who accept either are bound to accept the other as well. Those, 
<A NAME="476"></A>on the other hand, who do not make their coming-to-be reciprocal-who refuse 
<A NAME="477"></A>to suppose that any one of the 'elements' comes-to-be out of any other 
<A NAME="478"></A>taken singly, except in the sense in which bricks come-to-be out of a wall-are 
<A NAME="479"></A>faced with a paradox. How, on their theory, are flesh and bones or any 
<A NAME="480"></A>of the other compounds to result from the 'elements' taken 
<A NAME="481"></A>together?
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, the point we have raised constitutes a problem even for 
<A NAME="483"></A>those who generate the 'elements' out of one another. In what manner does 
<A NAME="484"></A>anything other than, and beside, the 'elements' come-to-be out of them? 
<A NAME="485"></A>Let me illustrate my meaning. Water can come-to-be out of Fire and Fire 
<A NAME="486"></A>out of Water; for their substralum is something common to them both. But 
<A NAME="487"></A>flesh too, presumably, and marrow come-to-be out of them. How, then, do 
<A NAME="488"></A>such things come to-be? For (a) how is the manner of their coming-to-be 
<A NAME="489"></A>to be conceived by those who maintain a theory like that of Empedocles? 
<A NAME="490"></A>They must conceive it as composition-just as a wall comes-to-be out of 
<A NAME="491"></A>bricks and stones: and the 'Mixture', of which they speak, will be composed 
<A NAME="492"></A>of the 'elements', these being preserved in it unaltered but with their 
<A NAME="493"></A>small particles juxtaposed each to each. That will be the manner, presumably, 
<A NAME="494"></A>in which flesh and every other compound results from the 'elements'. Consequently, 
<A NAME="495"></A>it follows that Fire and Water do not come-to-be 'out of any and every 
<A NAME="496"></A>part of flesh'. For instance, although a sphere might come-to-be out of 
<A NAME="497"></A>this part of a lump of wax and a pyramid out of some other part, it was 
<A NAME="498"></A>nevertheless possible for either figure to have come-to-be out of either 
<A NAME="499"></A>part indifferently: that is the manner of coming-to-be when 'both Fire 
<A NAME="500"></A>and Water come-to-be out of any and every part of flesh'. Those, however, 
<A NAME="501"></A>who maintain the theory in question, are not at liberty to conceive that 
<A NAME="502"></A>'both come-to-be out of flesh' in that manner, but only as a stone and 
<A NAME="503"></A>a brick 'both come-to-be out of a wall'-viz. each out of a different place 
<A NAME="504"></A>or part. Similarly (b) even for those who postulate a single matter of 
<A NAME="505"></A>their 'elements' there is a certain difficulty in explaining how anything 
<A NAME="506"></A>is to result from two of them taken together-e.g. from 'cold' and hot', 
<A NAME="507"></A>or from Fire and Earth. For if flesh consists of both and is neither of 
<A NAME="508"></A>them, nor again is a 'composition' of them in which they are preserved 
<A NAME="509"></A>unaltered, what alternative is left except to identify the resultant of 
<A NAME="510"></A>the two 'elements' with their matter? For the passingaway of either 'element' 
<A NAME="511"></A>produces either the other or the matter.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps we may suggest the following solution. (i) There are differences 
<A NAME="513"></A>of degree in hot and cold. Although, therefore, when either is fully real 
<A NAME="514"></A>without qualification, the other will exist potentially; yet, when neither 
<A NAME="515"></A>exists in the full completeness of its being, but both by combining destroy 
<A NAME="516"></A>one another's excesses so that there exist instead a hot which (for a 'hot') 
<A NAME="517"></A>is cold and a cold which (for a 'cold') is hot; then what results from 
<A NAME="518"></A>these two contraries will be neither their matter, nor either of them existing 
<A NAME="519"></A>in its full reality without qualification. There will result instead an 
<A NAME="520"></A>'intermediate': and this 'intermediate', according as it is potentially 
<A NAME="521"></A>more hot than cold or vice versa, will possess a power-of-heating that 
<A NAME="522"></A>is double or triple its power-of-cooling, or otherwise related thereto 
<A NAME="523"></A>in some similar ratio. Thus all the other bodies will result from the contraries, 
<A NAME="524"></A>or rather from the 'elements', in so far as these have been 'combined': 
<A NAME="525"></A>while the elements' will result from the contraries, in so far as these 
<A NAME="526"></A>'exist potentially' in a special sense-not as matter 'exists potentially', 
<A NAME="527"></A>but in the sense explained above. And when a thing comes-to-be in this 
<A NAME="528"></A>manner, the process is cobination'; whereas what comes-to-be in the other 
<A NAME="529"></A>manner is matter. Moreover (ii) contraries also 'suffer action', in accordance 
<A NAME="530"></A>with the disjunctively-articulated definition established in the early 
<A NAME="531"></A>part of this work.' For the actually-hot is potentially-cold and the actually 
<A NAME="532"></A>cold potentially-hot; so that hot and cold, unless they are equally balanced, 
<A NAME="533"></A>are transformed into one another (and all the other contraries behave in 
<A NAME="534"></A>a similar way). It is thus, then, that in the first place the 'elements' 
<A NAME="535"></A>are transformed; and that (in the second place) out of the 'elements' there 
<A NAME="536"></A>come-to-be flesh and bones and the like-the hot becoming cold and the cold 
<A NAME="537"></A>becoming hot when they have been brought to the 'mean'. For at the 'mean' 
<A NAME="538"></A>is neither hot nor cold. The 'mean', however, is of considerable extent 
<A NAME="539"></A>and not indivisible. Similarly, it is qua reduced to a 'mean' condition 
<A NAME="540"></A>that the dry and the moist, as well as the contraries we have used as examples, 
<A NAME="541"></A>produce flesh and bone and the remaining compounds.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="542"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR>All the compound bodies-all of which exist in the region belonging 
<A NAME="544"></A>to the central body-are composed of all the 'simple' bodies. For they all 
<A NAME="545"></A>contain Earth because every 'simple' body is to be found specially and 
<A NAME="546"></A>most abundantly in its own place. And they all contain Water because (a) 
<A NAME="547"></A>the compound must possess a definite outline and Water, alone of the 'simple' 
<A NAME="548"></A>bodies, is readily adaptable in shape: moreover (b) Earth has no power 
<A NAME="549"></A>of cohesion without the moist. On the contrary, the moist is what holds 
<A NAME="550"></A>it together; for it would fall to pieces if the moist were eliminated from 
<A NAME="551"></A>it completely.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR>They contain Earth and Water, then, for the reasons we have given: 
<A NAME="553"></A>and they contain Air and Fire, because these are contrary to Earth and 
<A NAME="554"></A>Water (Earth being contrary to Air and Water to Fire, in so far as one 
<A NAME="555"></A>Substance can be 'contrary' to another). Now all compounds presuppose in 
<A NAME="556"></A>their coming-to-be constituents which are contrary to one another: and 
<A NAME="557"></A>in all compounds there is contained one set of the contrasted extremes. 
<A NAME="558"></A>Hence the other set must be contained in them also, so that every compound 
<A NAME="559"></A>will include all the 'simple' bodies.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>Additional evidence seems to be furnished by the food each compound 
<A NAME="561"></A>takes. For all of them are fed by substances which are the same as their 
<A NAME="562"></A>constituents, and all of them are fed by more substances than one. Indeed, 
<A NAME="563"></A>even the plants, though it might be thought they are fed by one substance 
<A NAME="564"></A>only, viz. by Water, are fed by more than one: for Earth has been mixed 
<A NAME="565"></A>with the Water. That is why farmers too endeavour to mix before watering. 
<A NAME="566"></A>Although food is akin to the matter, that which is fed is the 'figure'-i.e. 
<A NAME="567"></A>the 'form' taken along with the matter. This fact enables us to understand 
<A NAME="568"></A>why, whereas all the 'simple' bodies come-to-be out of one another, Fire 
<A NAME="569"></A>is the only one of them which (as our predecessors also assert) 'is fed'. 
<A NAME="570"></A>For Fire alone-or more than all the rest-is akin to the 'form' because 
<A NAME="571"></A>it tends by nature to be borne towards the limit. Now each of them naturally 
<A NAME="572"></A>tends to be borne towards its own place; but the 'figure'-i.e. the 'form'-Of 
<A NAME="573"></A>them all is at the limits.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>Thus we have explained that all the compound bodies are composed 
<A NAME="575"></A>of all the 'simple' bodies.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="576"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR>Since some things are such as to come-to-be and pass-away, and 
<A NAME="578"></A>since coming-to-be in fact occurs in the region about the centre, we must 
<A NAME="579"></A>explain the number and the nature of the 'originative sources' of all coming-to-be 
<A NAME="580"></A>alike: for a grasp of the true theory of any universal facilitates the 
<A NAME="581"></A>understanding of its specific forms.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>The 'originative sources', then, of the things which come-to-be 
<A NAME="583"></A>are equal in number to, and identical in kind with, those in the sphere 
<A NAME="584"></A>of the eternal and primary things. For there is one in the sense of 'matter', 
<A NAME="585"></A>and a second in the sense of 'form': and, in addition, the third 'originative 
<A NAME="586"></A>source' must be present as well. For the two first are not sufficient to 
<A NAME="587"></A>bring things into being, any more than they are adequate to account for 
<A NAME="588"></A>the primary things.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>Now cause, in the sense of material origin, for the things which 
<A NAME="590"></A>are such as to come-to-be is 'that which can be-and-not-be': and this is 
<A NAME="591"></A>identical with'that which can come-to-be-and-pass-away', since the latter, 
<A NAME="592"></A>while it is at one time, at another time is not. (For whereas some things 
<A NAME="593"></A>are of necessity, viz. the eternal things, others of necessity are not. 
<A NAME="594"></A>And of these two sets of things, since they cannot diverge from the necessity 
<A NAME="595"></A>of their nature, it is impossible for the first not to he and impossible 
<A NAME="596"></A>for the second to he. Other things, however, can both be and not he.) Hence 
<A NAME="597"></A>coming-to-be and passing-away must occur within the field of 'that which 
<A NAME="598"></A>can be-and not-be'. This, therefore, is cause in the sense of material 
<A NAME="599"></A>origin for the things which are such as to come-to-be; while cause, in 
<A NAME="600"></A>the sense of their 'end', is their 'figure' or 'form'-and that is the formula 
<A NAME="601"></A>expressing the essential nature of each of them.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR>But the third 'originative source' must be present as well-the 
<A NAME="603"></A>cause vaguely dreamed of by all our predecessors, definitely stated by 
<A NAME="604"></A>none of them. On the contrary (a) some amongst them thought the nature 
<A NAME="605"></A>of 'the Forms' was adequate to account for coming-to-be. Thus Socrates 
<A NAME="606"></A>in the Phaedo first blames everybody else for having given no explanation; 
<A NAME="607"></A>and then lays it down; that 'some things are Forms, others Participants 
<A NAME="608"></A>in the Forms', and that 'while a thing is said to "be" in virtue of the 
<A NAME="609"></A>Form, it is said to "come-to-be" qua sharing in," to "pass-away" qua "losing," 
<A NAME="610"></A>the 'Form'. Hence he thinks that 'assuming the truth of these theses, the 
<A NAME="611"></A>Forms must be causes both of coming-to-be and of passing-away'. On the 
<A NAME="612"></A>other hand (b) there were others who thought 'the matter' was adequate 
<A NAME="613"></A>by itself to account for coming-to-be, since 'the movement originates from 
<A NAME="614"></A>the matter'.
<A NAME="615"></A><BR><BR>Neither of these theories, however, is sound. For (a) if the Forms 
<A NAME="616"></A>are causes, why is their generating activity intermittent instead of perpetual 
<A NAME="617"></A>and continuous-since there always are Participants as well as Forms? Besides, 
<A NAME="618"></A>in some instances we see that the cause is other than the Form. For it 
<A NAME="619"></A>is the doctor who implants health and the man of science who implants science, 
<A NAME="620"></A>although 'Health itself' and 'Science itself' are as well as the Participants: 
<A NAME="621"></A>and the same principle applies to everything else that is produced in accordance 
<A NAME="622"></A>with an art. On the other hand (b) to say that 'matter generates owing 
<A NAME="623"></A>to its movement' would be, no doubt, more scientific than to make such 
<A NAME="624"></A>statements as are made by the thinkers we have been criticizing. For what 
<A NAME="625"></A>'alters' and transfigures plays a greater part in bringing, things into 
<A NAME="626"></A>being; and we are everywhere accustomed, in the products of nature and 
<A NAME="627"></A>of art alike, to look upon that which can initiate movement as the producing 
<A NAME="628"></A>cause. Nevertheless this second theory is not right 
<A NAME="629"></A>either.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>For, to begin with, it is characteristic of matter to suffer action, 
<A NAME="631"></A>i.e. to be moved: but to move, i.e. to act, belongs to a different 'power'. 
<A NAME="632"></A>This is obvious both in the things that come-to-be by art and in those 
<A NAME="633"></A>that come to-be by nature. Water does not of itself produce out of itself 
<A NAME="634"></A>an animal: and it is the art, not the wood, that makes a bed. Nor is this 
<A NAME="635"></A>their only error. They make a second mistake in omitting the more controlling 
<A NAME="636"></A>cause: for they eliminate the essential nature, i.e. the 'form'. And what 
<A NAME="637"></A>is more, since they remove the formal cause, they invest the forces they 
<A NAME="638"></A>assign to the 'simple' bodies-the forces which enable these bodies to bring 
<A NAME="639"></A>things into being-with too instrumental a character. For 'since' (as they 
<A NAME="640"></A>say) 'it is the nature of the hot to dissociate, of the cold to bring together, 
<A NAME="641"></A>and of each remaining contrary either to act or to suffer action', it is 
<A NAME="642"></A>out of such materials and by their agency (so they maintain) that everything 
<A NAME="643"></A>else comes-to-be and passes-away. Yet (a) it is evident that even Fire 
<A NAME="644"></A>is itself moved, i.e. suffers action. Moreover (b) their procedure is virtually 
<A NAME="645"></A>the same as if one were to treat the saw (and the various instruments of 
<A NAME="646"></A>carpentry) as 'the cause' of the things that come-to-be: for the wood must 
<A NAME="647"></A>be divided if a man saws, must become smooth if he planes, and so on with 
<A NAME="648"></A>the remaining tools. Hence, however true it may be that Fire is active, 
<A NAME="649"></A>i.e. sets things moving, there is a further point they fail to observe-viz. 
<A NAME="650"></A>that Fire is inferior to the tools or instruments in the manner in which 
<A NAME="651"></A>it sets things moving.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="652"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="653"></A><BR><BR>As to our own theory-we have given a general account of the causes 
<A NAME="654"></A>in an earlier work,' we have now explained and distinguished the 'matter' 
<A NAME="655"></A>and the 'form'. Further, since the change which is motion has been proved' 
<A NAME="656"></A>to be eternal, the continuity of the occurrence of coming-to-be follows 
<A NAME="657"></A>necessarily from what we have established: for the eternal motion, by causing 
<A NAME="658"></A>'the generator' to approach and retire, will produce coming-to-be uninterruptedly. 
<A NAME="659"></A>At the same time it is clear that we were right when, in an earlier work,' 
<A NAME="660"></A>we called motion (not coming-to-be) 'the primary form of change'. For it 
<A NAME="661"></A>is far more reasonable that what is should cause the coming-to-be of what 
<A NAME="662"></A>is not, than that what is not should cause the being of what is. Now that 
<A NAME="663"></A>which is being moved is, but that which is coming-to-be is not: hence, 
<A NAME="664"></A>also, motion is prior to coming-to-be.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR>We have assumed, and have proved, that coming-to-be and passing-away 
<A NAME="666"></A>happen to things continuously; and we assert that motion causes coming-to-be. 
<A NAME="667"></A>That being so, it is evident that, if the motion be single, both processes 
<A NAME="668"></A>cannot occur since they are contrary to one another: for it is a law of 
<A NAME="669"></A>nature that the same cause, provided it remain in the same condition, always 
<A NAME="670"></A>produces the same effect, so that, from a single motion, either coming-to-be 
<A NAME="671"></A>or passing-away will always result. The movements must, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="672"></A>be more than one, and they must be contrasted with one another either by 
<A NAME="673"></A>the sense of their motion or by its irregularity: for contrary effects 
<A NAME="674"></A>demand contraries as their causes.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR>This explains why it is not the primary motion that causes coming-to-be 
<A NAME="676"></A>and passingaway, but the motion along the inclined circle: for this motion 
<A NAME="677"></A>not only possesses the necessary continuity, but includes a duality of 
<A NAME="678"></A>movements as well. For if coming-to-be and passing-away are always to be 
<A NAME="679"></A>continuous, there must be some body always being moved (in order that these 
<A NAME="680"></A>changes may not fail) and moved with a duality of movements (in order that 
<A NAME="681"></A>both changes, not one only, may result). Now the continuity of this movement 
<A NAME="682"></A>is caused by the motion of the whole: but the approaching and retreating 
<A NAME="683"></A>of the moving body are caused by the inclination. For the consequence of 
<A NAME="684"></A>the inclination is that the body becomes alternately remote and near; and 
<A NAME="685"></A>since its distance is thus unequal, its movement will be irregular. Therefore, 
<A NAME="686"></A>if it generates by approaching and by its proximity, it-this very same 
<A NAME="687"></A>body-destroys by retreating and becoming remote: and if it generates by 
<A NAME="688"></A>many successive approaches, it also destroys by many successive retirements. 
<A NAME="689"></A>For contrary effects demand contraries as their causes; and the natural 
<A NAME="690"></A>processes of passing-away and coming-to-be occupy equal periods of time. 
<A NAME="691"></A>Hence, too, the times-i.e. the lives-of the several kinds of living things 
<A NAME="692"></A>have a number by which they are distinguished: for there is an Order controlling 
<A NAME="693"></A>all things, and every time (i.e. every life) is measured by a period. Not 
<A NAME="694"></A>all of them, however, are measured by the same period, but some by a smaller 
<A NAME="695"></A>and others by a greater one: for to some of them the period, which is their 
<A NAME="696"></A>measure, is a year, while to some it is longer and to others 
<A NAME="697"></A>shorter.
<A NAME="698"></A><BR><BR>And there are facts of observation in manifest agreement with our 
<A NAME="699"></A>theories. Thus we see that coming-to-be occurs as the sun approaches and 
<A NAME="700"></A>decay as it retreats; and we see that the two processes occupy equal times. 
<A NAME="701"></A>For the durations of the natural processes of passing-away and coming-to-be 
<A NAME="702"></A>are equal. Nevertheless it Often happens that things pass-away in too short 
<A NAME="703"></A>a time. This is due to the 'intermingling' by which the things that come-to-be 
<A NAME="704"></A>and pass-away are implicated with one another. For their matter is 'irregular', 
<A NAME="705"></A>i.e. is not everywhere the same: hence the processes by which they come-to-be 
<A NAME="706"></A>must be 'irregular' too, i.e. some too quick and others too slow. Consequently 
<A NAME="707"></A>the phenomenon in question occurs, because the 'irregular' coming-to-be 
<A NAME="708"></A>of these things is the passing-away of other things.
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR>Coming-to-be and passing-away will, as we have said, always be 
<A NAME="710"></A>continuous, and will never fail owing to the cause we stated. And this 
<A NAME="711"></A>continuity has a sufficient reason on our theory. For in all things, as 
<A NAME="712"></A>we affirm, Nature always strives after 'the better'. Now 'being' (we have 
<A NAME="713"></A>explained elsewhere the exact variety of meanings we recognize in this 
<A NAME="714"></A>term) is better than 'not-being': but not all things can possess 'being', 
<A NAME="715"></A>since they are too far removed from the 'originative source. 'God therefore 
<A NAME="716"></A>adopted the remaining alternative, and fulfilled the perfection of the 
<A NAME="717"></A>universe by making coming-to-be uninterrupted: for the greatest possible 
<A NAME="718"></A>coherence would thus be secured to existence, because that 'coming-to-be 
<A NAME="719"></A>should itself come-to-be perpetually' is the closest approximation to eternal 
<A NAME="720"></A>being.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR>The cause of this perpetuity of coming-to-be, as we have often 
<A NAME="722"></A>said, is circular motion: for that is the only motion which is continuous. 
<A NAME="723"></A>That, too, is why all the other things-the things, I mean, which are reciprocally 
<A NAME="724"></A>transformed in virtue of their 'passions' and their 'powers of action' 
<A NAME="725"></A>e.g. the 'simple' bodiesimitate circular motion. For when Water is transformed 
<A NAME="726"></A>into Air, Air into Fire, and the Fire back into Water, we say the coming-to-be 
<A NAME="727"></A>'has completed the circle', because it reverts again to the beginning. 
<A NAME="728"></A>Hence it is by imitating circular motion that rectilinear motion too is 
<A NAME="729"></A>continuous.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR><BR>These considerations serve at the same time to explain what is 
<A NAME="731"></A>to some people a baffling problem-viz. why the 'simple' bodies, since each 
<A NAME="732"></A>them is travelling towards its own place, have not become dissevered from 
<A NAME="733"></A>one another in the infinite lapse of time. The reason is their reciprocal 
<A NAME="734"></A>transformation. For, had each of them persisted in its own place instead 
<A NAME="735"></A>of being transformed by its neighbour, they would have got dissevered long 
<A NAME="736"></A>ago. They are transformed, however, owing to the motion with its dual character: 
<A NAME="737"></A>and because they are transformed, none of them is able to persist in any 
<A NAME="738"></A>place allotted to it by the Order.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>It is clear from what has been said (i) that coming-to-be and passing-away 
<A NAME="740"></A>actually occur, (ii) what causes them, and (iii) what subject undergoes 
<A NAME="741"></A>them. But (a) if there is to be movement (as we have explained elsewhere, 
<A NAME="742"></A>in an earlier work') there must be something which initiates it; if there 
<A NAME="743"></A>is to be movement always, there must always be something which initiates 
<A NAME="744"></A>it; if the movement is to be continuous, what initiates it must be single, 
<A NAME="745"></A>unmoved, ungenerated, and incapable of 'alteration'; and if the circular 
<A NAME="746"></A>movements are more than one, their initiating causes must all of them, 
<A NAME="747"></A>in spite of their plurality, be in some way subordinated to a single 'originative 
<A NAME="748"></A>source'. Further (b) since time is continuous, movement must be continuous, 
<A NAME="749"></A>inasmuch as there can be no time without movement. Time, therefore, is 
<A NAME="750"></A>a 'number' of some continuous movement-a 'number', therefore, of the circular 
<A NAME="751"></A>movement, as was established in the discussions at the beginning. But (c) 
<A NAME="752"></A>is movement continuous because of the continuity of that which is moved, 
<A NAME="753"></A>or because that in which the movement occurs (I mean, e.g. the place or 
<A NAME="754"></A>the quality) is continuous? The answer must clearly be 'because that which 
<A NAME="755"></A>is moved is continuous'. (For how can the quality be continuous except 
<A NAME="756"></A>in virtue of the continuity of the thing to which it belongs? But if the 
<A NAME="757"></A>continuity of 'that in which' contributes to make the movement continuous, 
<A NAME="758"></A>this is true only of 'the place in which'; for that has 'magnitude' in 
<A NAME="759"></A>a sense.) But (d) amongst continuous bodies which are moved, only that 
<A NAME="760"></A>which is moved in a circle is 'continuous' in such a way that it preserves 
<A NAME="761"></A>its continuity with itself throughout the movement. The conclusion therefore 
<A NAME="762"></A>is that this is what produces continuous movement, viz. the body which 
<A NAME="763"></A>is being moved in a circle; and its movement makes time 
<A NAME="764"></A>continuous.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="765"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="766"></A><BR><BR>Wherever there is continuity in any process (coming-to-be or 'alteration' 
<A NAME="767"></A>or any kind of change whatever) we observe consecutiveness', i.e. this 
<A NAME="768"></A>coming-to-be after that without any interval. Hence we must investigate 
<A NAME="769"></A>whether, amongst the consecutive members, there is any whose future being 
<A NAME="770"></A>is necessary; or whether, on the contrary, every one of them may fail to 
<A NAME="771"></A>come-to-be. For that some of them may fail to occur, is clear. (a) We need 
<A NAME="772"></A>only appeal to the distinction between the statements 'x will be' and 'x 
<A NAME="773"></A>is about to which depends upon this fact. For if it be true to say of x 
<A NAME="774"></A>that it 'will be', it must at some time be true to say of it that 'it is': 
<A NAME="775"></A>whereas, though it be true to say of x now that 'it is about to occur', 
<A NAME="776"></A>it is quite possible for it not to come-to-be-thus a man might not walk, 
<A NAME="777"></A>though he is now 'about to' walk. And (b) since (to appeal to a general 
<A NAME="778"></A>principle) amongst the things which 'are' some are capable also of 'not-being', 
<A NAME="779"></A>it is clear that the same ambiguous character will attach to them no less 
<A NAME="780"></A>when they are coming-to-be: in other words, their coming-to-be will not 
<A NAME="781"></A>be necessary.
<A NAME="782"></A><BR><BR>Then are all the things that come-to-be of this contingent character? 
<A NAME="783"></A>Or, on the contrary, is it absolutely necessary for some of them to come-to-be? 
<A NAME="784"></A>Is there, in fact, a distinction in the field of 'coming-to-be' corresponding 
<A NAME="785"></A>to the distinction, within the field of 'being', between things that cannot 
<A NAME="786"></A>possibly 'not-be' and things that can 'not-be'? For instance, is it necessary 
<A NAME="787"></A>that solstices shall come-to-be, i.e. impossible that they should fail 
<A NAME="788"></A>to be able to occur?
<A NAME="789"></A><BR><BR>Assuming that the antecedent must have come-to-be if the consequent 
<A NAME="790"></A>is to be (e.g. that foundations must have come-to-be if there is to be 
<A NAME="791"></A>a house: clay, if there are to be foundations), is the converse also true? 
<A NAME="792"></A>If foundations have come-to-be, must a house come-to-be? The answer seems 
<A NAME="793"></A>to be that the necessary nexus no longer holds, unless it is 'necessary' 
<A NAME="794"></A>for the consequent (as well as for the antecedent) to come-to-be-'necessary' 
<A NAME="795"></A>absolutely. If that be the case, however, 'a house must come to-be if foundations 
<A NAME="796"></A>have come-to-be', as well as vice versa. For the antecedent was assumed 
<A NAME="797"></A>to be so related to the consequent that, if the latter is to be, the antecedent 
<A NAME="798"></A>must have come-tobe before it. If, therefore, it is necessary that the 
<A NAME="799"></A>consequent should come-to-be, the antecedent also must have come-to-be: 
<A NAME="800"></A>and if the antecedent has come-to-be, then the consequent also must come-to-be-not, 
<A NAME="801"></A>however, because of the antecedent, but because the future being of the 
<A NAME="802"></A>consequent was assumed as necessary. Hence, in any sequence, when the being 
<A NAME="803"></A>of the consequent is necessary, the nexus is reciprocal-in other words, 
<A NAME="804"></A>when the antecedent has come-to-be the consequent must always come-to-be 
<A NAME="805"></A>too.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR>Now (i) if the sequence of occurrences is to proceed ad infinitum 
<A NAME="807"></A>'downwards', the coming to-be of any determinate 'this' amongst the later 
<A NAME="808"></A>members of the sequence will not be absolutely, but only conditionally, 
<A NAME="809"></A>necessary. For it will always be necessary that some other member shall 
<A NAME="810"></A>have come-to-be before 'this' as the presupposed condition of the necessity 
<A NAME="811"></A>that 'this' should come-to-be: consequently, since what is 'infinite' has 
<A NAME="812"></A>no 'originative source', neither will there be in the infinite sequence 
<A NAME="813"></A>any 'primary' member which will make it 'necessary' for the remaining members 
<A NAME="814"></A>to come-to-be.
<A NAME="815"></A><BR><BR>Nor again (ii) will it be possible to say with truth, even in regard 
<A NAME="816"></A>to the members of a limited sequence, that it is 'absolutely necessary' 
<A NAME="817"></A>for any one of them to come-to-be. We cannot truly say, e.g. that 'it is 
<A NAME="818"></A>absolutely necessary for a house to come-to-be when foundations have been 
<A NAME="819"></A>laid': for (unless it is always necessary for a house to be coming-to-be) 
<A NAME="820"></A>we should be faced with the consequence that, when foundations have been 
<A NAME="821"></A>laid, a thing, which need not always be, must always be. No: if its coming-to-be 
<A NAME="822"></A>is to be 'necessary', it must be 'always' in its coming-to-be. For what 
<A NAME="823"></A>is 'of necessity' coincides with what is 'always', since that which 'must 
<A NAME="824"></A>be' cannot possibly 'not-be'. Hence a thing is eternal if its 'being' is 
<A NAME="825"></A>necessary: and if it is eternal, its 'being' is necessary. And if, therefore, 
<A NAME="826"></A>the 'coming-to-be' of a thing is necessary, its 'coming-to-be' is eternal; 
<A NAME="827"></A>and if eternal, necessary.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR><BR>It follows that the coming-to-be of anything, if it is absolutely 
<A NAME="829"></A>necessary, must be cyclical-i.e. must return upon itself. For coming to-be 
<A NAME="830"></A>must either be limited or not limited: and if not limited, it must be either 
<A NAME="831"></A>rectilinear or cyclical. But the first of these last two alternatives is 
<A NAME="832"></A>impossible if coming-to-be is to be eternal, because there could not be 
<A NAME="833"></A>any 'originative source' whatever in an infinite rectilinear sequence, 
<A NAME="834"></A>whether its members be taken 'downwards' (as future events) or 'upwards' 
<A NAME="835"></A>(as past events). Yet coming-to-be must have an 'originative source' (if 
<A NAME="836"></A>it is to be necessary and therefore eternal), nor can it be eternal if 
<A NAME="837"></A>it is limited. Consequently it must be cyclical. Hence the nexus must be 
<A NAME="838"></A>reciprocal. By this I mean that the necessary occurrence of 'this' involves 
<A NAME="839"></A>the necessary occurrence of its antecedent: and conversely that, given 
<A NAME="840"></A>the antecedent, it is also necessary for the consequent to come-to-be. 
<A NAME="841"></A>And this reciprocal nexus will hold continuously throughout the sequence: 
<A NAME="842"></A>for it makes no difference whether the reciprocal nexus, of which we are 
<A NAME="843"></A>speaking, is mediated by two, or by many, members.
<A NAME="844"></A><BR><BR>It is in circular movement, therefore, and in cyclical coming-to-be 
<A NAME="845"></A>that the 'absolutely necessary' is to be found. In other words, if the 
<A NAME="846"></A>coming-to-be of any things is cyclical, it is 'necessary' that each of 
<A NAME="847"></A>them is coming-to-be and has come-to-be: and if the coming-to-be of any 
<A NAME="848"></A>things is 'necessary', their coming-to-be is cyclical.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR><BR>The result we have reached is logically concordant with the eternity 
<A NAME="850"></A>of circular motion, i.e. the eternity of the revolution of the heavens 
<A NAME="851"></A>(a fact which approved itself on other and independent evidence),' since 
<A NAME="852"></A>precisely those movements which belong to, and depend upon, this eternal 
<A NAME="853"></A>revolution 'come-to-be' of necessity, and of necessity 'will be'. For since 
<A NAME="854"></A>the revolving body is always setting something else in motion, the movement 
<A NAME="855"></A>of the things it moves must also be circular. Thus, from the being of the 
<A NAME="856"></A>'upper revolution' it follows that the sun revolves in this determinate 
<A NAME="857"></A>manner; and since the sun revolves thus, the seasons in consequence come-to-be 
<A NAME="858"></A>in a cycle, i.e. return upon themselves; and since they come-to-be cyclically, 
<A NAME="859"></A>so in their turn do the things whose coming-to-be the seasons 
<A NAME="860"></A>initiate.
<A NAME="861"></A><BR><BR>Then why do some things manifestly come to-be in this cyclical 
<A NAME="862"></A>fashion (as, e.g. showers and air, so that it must rain if there is to 
<A NAME="863"></A>be a cloud and, conversely, there must be a cloud if it is to rain), while 
<A NAME="864"></A>men and animals do not 'return upon themselves' so that the same individual 
<A NAME="865"></A>comes-to-be a second time (for though your coming-to-be presupposes your 
<A NAME="866"></A>father's, his coming-to-be does not presuppose yours)? Why, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="867"></A>does this coming-to-be seem to constitute a rectilinear 
<A NAME="868"></A>sequence?
<A NAME="869"></A><BR><BR>In discussing this new problem, we must begin by inquiring whether 
<A NAME="870"></A>all things 'return upon themselves' in a uniform manner; or whether, on 
<A NAME="871"></A>the contrary, though in some sequences what recurs is numerically the same, 
<A NAME="872"></A>in other sequences it is the same only in species. In consequence of this 
<A NAME="873"></A>distinction, it is evident that those things, whose 'substance'-that which 
<A NAME="874"></A>is undergoing the process-is imperishable, will be numerically, as well 
<A NAME="875"></A>as specifically, the same in their recurrence: for the character of the 
<A NAME="876"></A>process is determined by the character of that which undergoes it. Those 
<A NAME="877"></A>things, on the other hand, whose 'substance' is perish, able (not imperishable) 
<A NAME="878"></A>must 'return upon themselves' in the sense that what recurs, though specifically 
<A NAME="879"></A>the same, is not the same numerically. That why, when Water comes-to-be 
<A NAME="880"></A>from Air and Air from Water, the Air is the same 'specifically', not 'numerically': 
<A NAME="881"></A>and if these too recur numerically the same, at any rate this does not 
<A NAME="882"></A>happen with things whose 'substance' comes-to-be-whose 'substance' is such 
<A NAME="883"></A>that it is essentially capable of not-being.
