<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>With regard to animals in general, some parts or organs are common to all, 
<A NAME="12"></A>as has been said, and some are common only to particular genera; the parts, 
<A NAME="13"></A>moreover, are identical with or different from one another on the lines 
<A NAME="14"></A>already repeatedly laid down. For as a general rule all animals that are 
<A NAME="15"></A>generically distinct have the majority of their parts or organs different 
<A NAME="16"></A>in form or species; and some of them they have only analogically similar 
<A NAME="17"></A>and diverse in kind or genus, while they have others that are alike in 
<A NAME="18"></A>kind but specifically diverse; and many parts or organs exist in some animals, 
<A NAME="19"></A>but not in others.
<A NAME="20"></A><BR><BR>For instance, viviparous quadrupeds have all a head and a neck, 
<A NAME="21"></A>and all the parts or organs of the head, but they differ each from other 
<A NAME="22"></A>in the shapes of the parts. The lion has its neck composed of one single 
<A NAME="23"></A>bone instead of vertebrae; but, when dissected, the animal is found in 
<A NAME="24"></A>all internal characters to resemble the dog.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>The quadrupedal vivipara instead of arms have forelegs. This is 
<A NAME="26"></A>true of all quadrupeds, but such of them as have toes have, practically 
<A NAME="27"></A>speaking, organs analogous to hands; at all events, they use these fore-limbs 
<A NAME="28"></A>for many purposes as hands. And they have the limbs on the left-hand side 
<A NAME="29"></A>less distinct from those on the right than man.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>The fore-limbs then serve more or less the purpose of hands in 
<A NAME="31"></A>quadrupeds, with the exception of the elephant. This latter animal has 
<A NAME="32"></A>its toes somewhat indistinctly defined, and its front legs are much bigger 
<A NAME="33"></A>than its hinder ones; it is five-toed, and has short ankles to its hind 
<A NAME="34"></A>feet. But it has a nose such in properties and such in size as to allow 
<A NAME="35"></A>of its using the same for a hand. For it eats and drinks by lifting up 
<A NAME="36"></A>its food with the aid of this organ into its mouth, and with the same organ 
<A NAME="37"></A>it lifts up articles to the driver on its back; with this organ it can 
<A NAME="38"></A>pluck up trees by the roots, and when walking through water it spouts the 
<A NAME="39"></A>water up by means of it; and this organ is capable of being crooked or 
<A NAME="40"></A>coiled at the tip, but not of flexing like a joint, for it is composed 
<A NAME="41"></A>of gristle.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>Of all animals man alone can learn to make equal use of both 
<A NAME="43"></A>hands.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>All animals have a part analogous to the chest in man, but not 
<A NAME="45"></A>similar to his; for the chest in man is broad, but that of all other animals 
<A NAME="46"></A>is narrow. Moreover, no other animal but man has breasts in front; the 
<A NAME="47"></A>elephant, certainly, has two breasts, not however in the chest, but near 
<A NAME="48"></A>it.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, also, animals have the flexions of their fore and hind 
<A NAME="50"></A>limbs in directions opposite to one another, and in directions the reverse 
<A NAME="51"></A>of those observed in the arms and legs of man; with the exception of the 
<A NAME="52"></A>elephant. In other words, with the viviparous quadrupeds the front legs 
<A NAME="53"></A>bend forwards and the hind ones backwards, and the concavities of the two 
<A NAME="54"></A>pairs of limbs thus face one another.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>The elephant does not sleep standing, as some were wont to assert, 
<A NAME="56"></A>but it bends its legs and settles down; only that in consequence of its 
<A NAME="57"></A>weight it cannot bend its leg on both sides simultaneously, but falls into 
<A NAME="58"></A>a recumbent position on one side or the other, and in this position it 
<A NAME="59"></A>goes to sleep. And it bends its hind legs just as a man bends his 
<A NAME="60"></A>legs.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>In the case of the ovipara, as the crocodile and the lizard and 
<A NAME="62"></A>the like, both pairs of legs, fore and hind, bend forwards, with a slight 
<A NAME="63"></A>swerve on one side. The flexion is similar in the case of the multipeds; 
<A NAME="64"></A>only that the legs in between the extreme ends always move in a manner 
<A NAME="65"></A>intermediate between that of those in front and those behind, and accordingly 
<A NAME="66"></A>bend sideways rather than backwards or forwards. But man bends his arms 
<A NAME="67"></A>and his legs towards the same point, and therefore in opposite ways: that 
<A NAME="68"></A>is to say, he bends his arms backwards, with just a slight inclination 
<A NAME="69"></A>inwards, and his legs frontwards. No animal bends both its fore-limbs and 
<A NAME="70"></A>hind-limbs backwards; but in the case of all animals the flexion of the 
<A NAME="71"></A>shoulders is in the opposite direction to that of the elbows or the joints 
<A NAME="72"></A>of the forelegs, and the flexure in the hips to that of the knees of the 
<A NAME="73"></A>hind-legs: so that since man differs from other animals in flexion, those 
<A NAME="74"></A>animals that possess such parts as these move them contrariwise to 
<A NAME="75"></A>man.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>Birds have the flexions of their limbs like those of the quadrupeds; 
<A NAME="77"></A>for, although bipeds, they bend their legs backwards, and instead of arms 
<A NAME="78"></A>or front legs have wings which bend frontwards.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>The seal is a kind of imperfect or crippled quadruped; for just 
<A NAME="80"></A>behind the shoulder-blade its front feet are placed, resembling hands, 
<A NAME="81"></A>like the front paws of the bear; for they are furnished with five toes, 
<A NAME="82"></A>and each of the toes has three flexions and a nail of inconsiderable size. 
<A NAME="83"></A>The hind feet are also furnished with five toes; in their flexions and 
<A NAME="84"></A>nails they resemble the front feet, and in shape they resemble a fish's 
<A NAME="85"></A>tail.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>The movements of animals, quadruped and multiped, are crosswise, 
<A NAME="87"></A>or in diagonals, and their equilibrium in standing posture is maintained 
<A NAME="88"></A>crosswise; and it is always the limb on the right-hand side that is the 
<A NAME="89"></A>first to move. The lion, however, and the two species of camels, both the 
<A NAME="90"></A>Bactrian and the Arabian, progress by an amble; and the action so called 
<A NAME="91"></A>is when the animal never overpasses the right with the left, but always 
<A NAME="92"></A>follows close upon it.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>Whatever parts men have in front, these parts quadrupeds have below, 
<A NAME="94"></A>in or on the belly; and whatever parts men have behind, these parts quadrupeds 
<A NAME="95"></A>have above on their backs. Most quadrupeds have a tail; for even the seal 
<A NAME="96"></A>has a tiny one resembling that of the stag. Regarding the tails of the 
<A NAME="97"></A>pithecoids we must give their distinctive properties by and by 
<A NAME="98"></A>animal
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>All viviparous quadrupeds are hair-coated, whereas man has only 
<A NAME="100"></A>a few short hairs excepting on the head, but, so far as the head is concerned, 
<A NAME="101"></A>he is hairier than any other animal. Further, of hair-coated animals, the 
<A NAME="102"></A>back is hairier than the belly, which latter is either comparatively void 
<A NAME="103"></A>of hair or smooth and void of hair altogether. With man the reverse is 
<A NAME="104"></A>the case.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>Man also has upper and lower eyelashes, and hair under the armpits 
<A NAME="106"></A>and on the pubes. No other animal has hair in either of these localities, 
<A NAME="107"></A>or has an under eyelash; though in the case of some animals a few straggling 
<A NAME="108"></A>hairs grow under the eyelid.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>Of hair-coated quadrupeds some are hairy all over the body, as 
<A NAME="110"></A>the pig, the bear, and the dog; others are especially hairy on the neck 
<A NAME="111"></A>and all round about it, as is the case with animals that have a shaggy 
<A NAME="112"></A>mane, such as the lion; others again are especially hairy on the upper 
<A NAME="113"></A>surface of the neck from the head as far as the withers, namely, such as 
<A NAME="114"></A>have a crested mane, as in the case with the horse, the mule, and, among 
<A NAME="115"></A>the undomesticated horned animals, the bison.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>The so-called hippelaphus also has a mane on its withers, and the 
<A NAME="117"></A>animal called pardion, in either case a thin mane extending from the head 
<A NAME="118"></A>to the withers; the hippelaphus has, exceptionally, a beard by the larynx. 
<A NAME="119"></A>Both these animals have horns and are cloven-footed; the female, however, 
<A NAME="120"></A>of the hippelaphus has no horns. This latter animal resembles the stag 
<A NAME="121"></A>in size; it is found in the territory of the Arachotae, where the wild 
<A NAME="122"></A>cattle also are found. Wild cattle differ from their domesticated congeners 
<A NAME="123"></A>just as the wild boar differs from the domesticated one. That is to say 
<A NAME="124"></A>they are black, strong looking, with a hook-nosed muzzle, and with horns 
<A NAME="125"></A>lying more over the back. The horns of the hippelaphus resemble those of 
<A NAME="126"></A>the gazelle.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>The elephant, by the way, is the least hairy of all quadrupeds. 
<A NAME="128"></A>With animals, as a general rule, the tail corresponds with the body as 
<A NAME="129"></A>regards thickness or thinness of hair-coating; that is, with animals that 
<A NAME="130"></A>have long tails, for some creatures have tails of altogether insignificant 
<A NAME="131"></A>size.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>Camels have an exceptional organ wherein they differ from all other 
<A NAME="133"></A>animals, and that is the so-called 'hump' on their back. The Bactrian camel 
<A NAME="134"></A>differs from the Arabian; for the former has two humps and the latter only 
<A NAME="135"></A>one, though it has, by the way, a kind of a hump below like the one above, 
<A NAME="136"></A>on which, when it kneels, the weight of the whole body rests. The camel 
<A NAME="137"></A>has four teats like the cow, a tail like that of an ass, and the privy 
<A NAME="138"></A>parts of the male are directed backwards. It has one knee in each leg, 
<A NAME="139"></A>and the flexures of the limb are not manifold, as some say, although they 
<A NAME="140"></A>appear to be so from the constricted shape of the region of the belly. 
<A NAME="141"></A>It has a huckle-bone like that of kine, but meagre and small in proportion 
<A NAME="142"></A>to its bulk. It is cloven-footed, and has not got teeth in both jaws; and 
<A NAME="143"></A>it is cloven footed in the following way: at the back there is a slight 
<A NAME="144"></A>cleft extending as far up as the second joint of the toes; and in front 
<A NAME="145"></A>there are small hooves on the tip of the first joint of the toes; and a 
<A NAME="146"></A>sort of web passes across the cleft, as in geese. The foot is fleshy underneath, 
<A NAME="147"></A>like that of the bear; so that, when the animal goes to war, they protect 
<A NAME="148"></A>its feet, when they get sore, with sandals.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>The legs of all quadrupeds are bony, sinewy, and fleshless; and 
<A NAME="150"></A>in point of fact such is the case with all animals that are furnished with 
<A NAME="151"></A>feet, with the exception of man. They are also unfurnished with buttocks; 
<A NAME="152"></A>and this last point is plain in an especial degree in birds. It is the 
<A NAME="153"></A>reverse with man; for there is scarcely any part of the body in which man 
<A NAME="154"></A>is so fleshy as in the buttock, the thigh, and the calf; for the part of 
<A NAME="155"></A>the leg called gastroenemia or is fleshy.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>Of blooded and viviparous quadrupeds some have the foot cloven 
<A NAME="157"></A>into many parts, as is the case with the hands and feet of man (for some 
<A NAME="158"></A>animals, by the way, are many-toed, as the lion, the dog, and the pard); 
<A NAME="159"></A>others have feet cloven in twain, and instead of nails have hooves, as 
<A NAME="160"></A>the sheep, the goat, the deer, and the hippopotamus; others are uncloven 
<A NAME="161"></A>of foot, such for instance as the solid-hooved animals, the horse and the 
<A NAME="162"></A>mule. Swine are either cloven-footed or uncloven-footed; for there are 
<A NAME="163"></A>in Illyria and in Paeonia and elsewhere solid-hooved swine. The cloven-footed 
<A NAME="164"></A>animals have two clefts behind; in the solid-hooved this part is continuous 
<A NAME="165"></A>and undivided.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore, of animals some are horned, and some are not so. The 
<A NAME="167"></A>great majority of the horned animals are cloven-footed, as the ox, the 
<A NAME="168"></A>stag, the goat; and a solid-hooved animal with a pair of horns has never 
<A NAME="169"></A>yet been met with. But a few animals are known to be singled-horned and 
<A NAME="170"></A>single-hooved, as the Indian ass; and one, to wit the oryx, is single horned 
<A NAME="171"></A>and cloven-hooved.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Of all solid-hooved animals the Indian ass alone has an astragalus 
<A NAME="173"></A>or huckle-bone; for the pig, as was said above, is either solid-hooved 
<A NAME="174"></A>or cloven-footed, and consequently has no well-formed huckle-bone. Of the 
<A NAME="175"></A>cloven footed many are provided with a huckle-bone. Of the many-fingered 
<A NAME="176"></A>or many-toed, no single one has been observed to have a huckle-bone, none 
<A NAME="177"></A>of the others any more than man. The lynx, however, has something like 
<A NAME="178"></A>a hemiastragal, and the lion something resembling the sculptor's 'labyrinth'. 
<A NAME="179"></A>All the animals that have a huckle-bone have it in the hinder legs. They 
<A NAME="180"></A>have also the bone placed straight up in the joint; the upper part, outside; 
<A NAME="181"></A>the lower part, inside; the sides called Coa turned towards one another, 
<A NAME="182"></A>the sides called Chia outside, and the keraiae or 'horns' on the top. This, 
<A NAME="183"></A>then, is the position of the hucklebone in the case of all animals provided 
<A NAME="184"></A>with the part.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>Some animals are, at one and the same time, furnished with a mane 
<A NAME="186"></A>and furnished also with a pair of horns bent in towards one another, as 
<A NAME="187"></A>is the bison (or aurochs), which is found in Paeonia and Maedica. But all 
<A NAME="188"></A>animals that are horned are quadrupedal, except in cases where a creature 
<A NAME="189"></A>is said metaphorically, or by a figure of speech, to have horns; just as 
<A NAME="190"></A>the Egyptians describe the serpents found in the neighbourhood of Thebes, 
<A NAME="191"></A>while in point of fact the creatures have merely protuberances on the head 
<A NAME="192"></A>sufficiently large to suggest such an epithet.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>Of horned animals the deer alone has a horn, or antler, hard and 
<A NAME="194"></A>solid throughout. The horns of other animals are hollow for a certain distance, 
<A NAME="195"></A>and solid towards the extremity. The hollow part is derived from the skin, 
<A NAME="196"></A>but the core round which this is wrapped-the hard part-is derived from 
<A NAME="197"></A>the bones; as is the case with the horns of oxen. The deer is the only 
<A NAME="198"></A>animal that sheds its horns, and it does so annually, after reaching the 
<A NAME="199"></A>age of two years, and again renews them. All other animals retain their 
<A NAME="200"></A>horns permanently, unless the horns be damaged by accident.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>Again, with regard to the breasts and the generative organs, animals 
<A NAME="202"></A>differ widely from one another and from man. For instance, the breasts 
<A NAME="203"></A>of some animals are situated in front, either in the chest or near to it, 
<A NAME="204"></A>and there are in such cases two breasts and two teats, as is the case with 
<A NAME="205"></A>man and the elephant, as previously stated. For the elephant has two breasts 
<A NAME="206"></A>in the region of the axillae; and the female elephant has two breasts insignificant 
<A NAME="207"></A>in size and in no way proportionate to the bulk of the entire frame, in 
<A NAME="208"></A>fact, so insignificant as to be invisible in a sideways view; the males 
<A NAME="209"></A>also have breasts, like the females, exceedingly small. The she-bear has 
<A NAME="210"></A>four breasts. Some animals have two breasts, but situated near the thighs, 
<A NAME="211"></A>and teats, likewise two in number, as the sheep; others have four teats, 
<A NAME="212"></A>as the cow. Some have breasts neither in the chest nor at the thighs, but 
<A NAME="213"></A>in the belly, as the dog and pig; and they have a considerable number of 
<A NAME="214"></A>breasts or dugs, but not all of equal size. Thus the shepard has four dugs 
<A NAME="215"></A>in the belly, the lioness two, and others more. The she-camel, also, has 
<A NAME="216"></A>two dugs and four teats, like the cow. Of solid-hooved animals the males 
<A NAME="217"></A>have no dugs, excepting in the case of males that take after the mother, 
<A NAME="218"></A>which phenomenon is observable in horses.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>Of male animals the genitals of some are external, as is the case 
<A NAME="220"></A>with man, the horse, and most other creatures; some are internal, as with 
<A NAME="221"></A>the dolphin. With those that have the organ externally placed, the organ 
<A NAME="222"></A>in some cases is situated in front, as in the cases already mentioned, 
<A NAME="223"></A>and of these some have the organ detached, both penis and testicles, as 
<A NAME="224"></A>man; others have penis and testicles closely attached to the belly, some 
<A NAME="225"></A>more closely, some less; for this organ is not detached in the wild boar 
<A NAME="226"></A>nor in the horse.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>The penis of the elephant resembles that of the horse; compared 
<A NAME="228"></A>with the size of the animal it is disproportionately small; the testicles 
<A NAME="229"></A>are not visible, but are concealed inside in the vicinity of the kidneys; 
<A NAME="230"></A>and for this reason the male speedily gives over in the act of intercourse. 
<A NAME="231"></A>The genitals of the female are situated where the udder is in sheep; when 
<A NAME="232"></A>she is in heat, she draws the organ back and exposes it externally, to 
<A NAME="233"></A>facilitate the act of intercourse for the male; and the organ opens out 
<A NAME="234"></A>to a considerable extent.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>With most animals the genitals have the position above assigned; 
<A NAME="236"></A>but some animals discharge their urine backwards, as the lynx, the lion, 
<A NAME="237"></A>the camel, and the hare. Male animals differ from one another, as has been 
<A NAME="238"></A>said, in this particular, but all female animals are retromingent: even 
<A NAME="239"></A>the female elephant like other animals, though she has the privy part below 
<A NAME="240"></A>the thighs.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>In the male organ itself there is a great diversity. For in some 
<A NAME="242"></A>cases the organ is composed of flesh and gristle, as in man; in such cases, 
<A NAME="243"></A>the fleshy part does not become inflated, but the gristly part is subject 
<A NAME="244"></A>to enlargement. In other cases, the organ is composed of fibrous tissue, 
<A NAME="245"></A>as with the camel and the deer; in other cases it is bony, as with the 
<A NAME="246"></A>fox, the wolf, the marten, and the weasel; for this organ in the weasel 
<A NAME="247"></A>has a bone.
<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>When man has arrived at maturity, his upper part is smaller than 
<A NAME="249"></A>the lower one, but with all other blooded animals the reverse holds good. 
<A NAME="250"></A>By the 'upper' part we mean all extending from the head down to the parts 
<A NAME="251"></A>used for excretion of residuum, and by the 'lower' part else. With animals 
<A NAME="252"></A>that have feet the hind legs are to be rated as the lower part in our comparison 
<A NAME="253"></A>of magnitudes, and with animals devoid of feet, the tail, and the 
<A NAME="254"></A>like.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>When animals arrive at maturity, their properties are as above 
<A NAME="256"></A>stated; but they differ greatly from one another in their growth towards 
<A NAME="257"></A>maturity. For instance, man, when young, has his upper part larger than 
<A NAME="258"></A>the lower, but in course of growth he comes to reverse this condition; 
<A NAME="259"></A>and it is owing to this circumstance that-an exceptional instance, by the 
<A NAME="260"></A>way-he does not progress in early life as he does at maturity, but in infancy 
<A NAME="261"></A>creeps on all fours; but some animals, in growth, retain the relative proportion 
<A NAME="262"></A>of the parts, as the dog. Some animals at first have the upper part smaller 
<A NAME="263"></A>and the lower part larger, and in course of growth the upper part gets 
<A NAME="264"></A>to be the larger, as is the case with the bushy-tailed animals such as 
<A NAME="265"></A>the horse; for in their case there is never, subsequently to birth, any 
<A NAME="266"></A>increase in the part extending from the hoof to the 
<A NAME="267"></A>haunch.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>Again, in respect to the teeth, animals differ greatly both from 
<A NAME="269"></A>one another and from man. All animals that are quadrupedal, blooded and 
<A NAME="270"></A>viviparous, are furnished with teeth; but, to begin with, some are double-toothed 
<A NAME="271"></A>(or fully furnished with teeth in both jaws), and some are not. For instance, 
<A NAME="272"></A>horned quadrupeds are not double-toothed; for they have not got the front 
<A NAME="273"></A>teeth in the upper jaw; and some hornless animals, also, are not double 
<A NAME="274"></A>toothed, as the camel. Some animals have tusks, like the boar, and some 
<A NAME="275"></A>have not. Further, some animals are saw-toothed, such as the lion, the 
<A NAME="276"></A>pard, and the dog; and some have teeth that do not interlock but have flat 
<A NAME="277"></A>opposing crowns, as the horse and the ox; and by 'saw-toothed' we mean 
<A NAME="278"></A>such animals as interlock the sharp-pointed teeth in one jaw between the 
<A NAME="279"></A>sharp-pointed ones in the other. No animal is there that possesses both 
<A NAME="280"></A>tusks and horns, nor yet do either of these structures exist in any animal 
<A NAME="281"></A>possessed of 'saw-teeth'. The front teeth are usually sharp, and the back 
<A NAME="282"></A>ones blunt. The seal is saw-toothed throughout, inasmuch as he is a sort 
<A NAME="283"></A>of link with the class of fishes; for fishes are almost all 
<A NAME="284"></A>saw-toothed.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>No animal of these genera is provided with double rows of teeth. 
<A NAME="286"></A>There is, however, an animal of the sort, if we are to believe Ctesias. 
<A NAME="287"></A>He assures us that the Indian wild beast called the 'martichoras' has a 
<A NAME="288"></A>triple row of teeth in both upper and lower jaw; that it is as big as a 
<A NAME="289"></A>lion and equally hairy, and that its feet resemble those of the lion; that 
<A NAME="290"></A>it resembles man in its face and ears; that its eyes are blue, and its 
<A NAME="291"></A>colour vermilion; that its tail is like that of the land-scorpion; that 
<A NAME="292"></A>it has a sting in the tail, and has the faculty of shooting off arrow-wise 
<A NAME="293"></A>the spines that are attached to the tail; that the sound of its voice is 
<A NAME="294"></A>a something between the sound of a pan-pipe and that of a trumpet; that 
<A NAME="295"></A>it can run as swiftly as deer, and that it is savage and a 
<A NAME="296"></A>man-eater.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>Man sheds his teeth, and so do other animals, as the horse, the 
<A NAME="298"></A>mule, and the ass. And man sheds his front teeth; but there is no instance 
<A NAME="299"></A>of an animal that sheds its molars. The pig sheds none of its teeth at 
<A NAME="300"></A>all.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="301"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>With regard to dogs some doubts are entertained, as some contend 
<A NAME="303"></A>that they shed no teeth whatever, and others that they shed the canines, 
<A NAME="304"></A>but those alone; the fact being, that they do shed their teeth like man, 
<A NAME="305"></A>but that the circumstance escapes observation, owing to the fact that they 
<A NAME="306"></A>never shed them until equivalent teeth have grown within the gums to take 
<A NAME="307"></A>the place of the shed ones. We shall be justified in supposing that the 
<A NAME="308"></A>case is similar with wild beasts in general; for they are said to shed 
<A NAME="309"></A>their canines only. Dogs can be distinguished from one another, the young 
<A NAME="310"></A>from the old, by their teeth; for the teeth in young dogs are white and 
<A NAME="311"></A>sharp-pointed; in old dogs, black and blunt.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="312"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>In this particular, the horse differs entirely from animals in 
<A NAME="314"></A>general: for, generally speaking, as animals grow older their teeth get 
<A NAME="315"></A>blacker, but the horse's teeth grow whiter with age.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>The so-called 'canines' come in between the sharp teeth and the 
<A NAME="317"></A>broad or blunt ones, partaking of the form of both kinds; for they are 
<A NAME="318"></A>broad at the base and sharp at the tip.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>Males have more teeth than females in the case of men, sheep, goats, 
<A NAME="320"></A>and swine; in the case of other animals observations have not yet been 
<A NAME="321"></A>made: but the more teeth they have the more long-lived are they, as a rule, 
<A NAME="322"></A>while those are short-lived in proportion that have teeth fewer in number 
<A NAME="323"></A>and thinly set.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="324"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>The last teeth to come in man are molars called 'wisdom-teeth', 
<A NAME="326"></A>which come at the age of twenty years, in the case of both sexes. Cases 
<A NAME="327"></A>have been known in women upwards. of eighty years old where at the very 
<A NAME="328"></A>close of life the wisdom-teeth have come up, causing great pain in their 
<A NAME="329"></A>coming; and cases have been known of the like phenomenon in men too. This 
<A NAME="330"></A>happens, when it does happen, in the case of people where the wisdom-teeth 
<A NAME="331"></A>have not come up in early years.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="332"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>The elephant has four teeth on either side, by which it munches 
<A NAME="334"></A>its food, grinding it like so much barley-meal, and, quite apart from these, 
<A NAME="335"></A>it has its great teeth, or tusks, two in number. In the male these tusks 
<A NAME="336"></A>are comparatively large and curved upwards; in the female, they are comparatively 
<A NAME="337"></A>small and point in the opposite direction; that is, they look downwards 
<A NAME="338"></A>towards the ground. The elephant is furnished with teeth at birth, but 
<A NAME="339"></A>the tusks are not then visible.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="340"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>The tongue of the elephant is exceedingly small, and situated far 
<A NAME="342"></A>back in the mouth, so that it is difficult to get a sight of 
<A NAME="343"></A>it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="344"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore, animals differ from one another in the relative size 
<A NAME="346"></A>of their mouths. In some animals the mouth opens wide, as is the case with 
<A NAME="347"></A>the dog, the lion, and with all the saw-toothed animals; other animals 
<A NAME="348"></A>have small mouths, as man; and others have mouths of medium capacity, as 
<A NAME="349"></A>the pig and his congeners.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>(The Egyptian hippopotamus has a mane like a horse, is cloven-footed 
<A NAME="351"></A>like an ox, and is snub-nosed. It has a huckle-bone like cloven-footed 
<A NAME="352"></A>animals, and tusks just visible; it has the tail of a pig, the neigh of 
<A NAME="353"></A>a horse, and the dimensions of an ass. The hide is so thick that spears 
<A NAME="354"></A>are made out of it. In its internal organs it resembles the horse and the 
<A NAME="355"></A>ass.)
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="356"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>Some animals share the properties of man and the quadrupeds, as 
<A NAME="358"></A>the ape, the monkey, and the baboon. The monkey is a tailed ape. The baboon 
<A NAME="359"></A>resembles the ape in form, only that it is bigger and stronger, more like 
<A NAME="360"></A>a dog in face, and is more savage in its habits, and its teeth are more 
<A NAME="361"></A>dog-like and more powerful.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>Apes are hairy on the back in keeping with their quadrupedal nature, 
<A NAME="363"></A>and hairy on the belly in keeping with their human form-for, as was said 
<A NAME="364"></A>above, this characteristic is reversed in man and the quadruped-only that 
<A NAME="365"></A>the hair is coarse, so that the ape is thickly coated both on the belly 
<A NAME="366"></A>and on the back. Its face resembles that of man in many respects; in other 
<A NAME="367"></A>words, it has similar nostrils and ears, and teeth like those of man, both 
<A NAME="368"></A>front teeth and molars. Further, whereas quadrupeds in general are not 
<A NAME="369"></A>furnished with lashes on one of the two eyelids, this creature has them 
<A NAME="370"></A>on both, only very thinly set, especially the under ones; in fact they 
<A NAME="371"></A>are very insignificant indeed. And we must bear in mind that all other 
<A NAME="372"></A>quadrupeds have no under eyelash at all.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>The ape has also in its chest two teats upon poorly developed breasts. 
<A NAME="374"></A>It has also arms like man, only covered with hair, and it bends these legs 
<A NAME="375"></A>like man, with the convexities of both limbs facing one another. In addition, 
<A NAME="376"></A>it has hands and fingers and nails like man, only that all these parts 
<A NAME="377"></A>are somewhat more beast-like in appearance. Its feet are exceptional in 
<A NAME="378"></A>kind. That is, they are like large hands, and the toes are like fingers, 
<A NAME="379"></A>with the middle one the longest of all, and the under part of the foot 
<A NAME="380"></A>is like a hand except for its length, and stretches out towards the extremities 
<A NAME="381"></A>like the palm of the hand; and this palm at the after end is unusually 
<A NAME="382"></A>hard, and in a clumsy obscure kind of way resembles a heel. The creature 
<A NAME="383"></A>uses its feet either as hands or feet, and doubles them up as one doubles 
<A NAME="384"></A>a fist. Its upper-arm and thigh are short in proportion to the forearm 
<A NAME="385"></A>and the shin. It has no projecting navel, but only a hardness in the ordinary 
<A NAME="386"></A>locality of the navel. Its upper part is much larger than its lower part, 
<A NAME="387"></A>as is the case with quadrupeds; in fact, the proportion of the former to 
<A NAME="388"></A>the latter is about as five to three. Owing to this circumstance and to 
<A NAME="389"></A>the fact that its feet resemble hands and are composed in a manner of hand 
<A NAME="390"></A>and of foot: of foot in the heel extremity, of the hand in all else-for 
<A NAME="391"></A>even the toes have what is called a 'palm':-for these reasons the animal 
<A NAME="392"></A>is oftener to be found on all fours than upright. It has neither hips, 
<A NAME="393"></A>inasmuch as it is a quadruped, nor yet a tail, inasmuch as it is a biped, 
<A NAME="394"></A>except nor yet a tal by the way that it has a tail as small as small can 
<A NAME="395"></A>be, just a sort of indication of a tail. The genitals of the female resemble 
<A NAME="396"></A>those of the female in the human species; those of the male are more like 
<A NAME="397"></A>those of a dog than are those of a man.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="398"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>The monkey, as has been observed, is furnished with a tail. In 
<A NAME="400"></A>all such creatures the internal organs are found under dissection to correspond 
<A NAME="401"></A>to those of man.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>So much then for the properties of the organs of such animals as 
<A NAME="403"></A>bring forth their young into the world alive.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="404"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>Oviparous and blooded quadrupeds-and, by the way, no terrestrial 
<A NAME="406"></A>blooded animal is oviparous unless it is quadrupedal or is devoid of feet 
<A NAME="407"></A>altogether-are furnished with a head, a neck, a back, upper and under parts, 
<A NAME="408"></A>the front legs and hind legs, and the part analogous to the chest, all 
<A NAME="409"></A>as in the case of viviparous quadrupeds, and with a tail, usually large, 
<A NAME="410"></A>in exceptional cases small. And all these creatures are many-toed, and 
<A NAME="411"></A>the several toes are cloven apart. Furthermore, they all have the ordinary 
<A NAME="412"></A>organs of sensation, including a tongue, with the exception of the Egyptian 
<A NAME="413"></A>crocodile.
<A NAME="414"></A><BR><BR>This latter animal, by the way, resembles certain fishes. For, 
<A NAME="415"></A>as a general rule, fishes have a prickly tongue, not free in its movements; 
<A NAME="416"></A>though there are some fishes that present a smooth undifferentiated surface 
<A NAME="417"></A>where the tongue should be, until you open their mouths wide and make a 
<A NAME="418"></A>close inspection.
<A NAME="419"></A><BR><BR>Again, oviparous blooded quadrupeds are unprovided with ears, but 
<A NAME="420"></A>possess only the passage for hearing; neither have they breasts, nor a 
<A NAME="421"></A>copulatory organ, nor external testicles, but internal ones only; neither 
<A NAME="422"></A>are they hair coated, but are in all cases covered with scaly plates. Moreover, 
<A NAME="423"></A>they are without exception saw-toothed.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>River crocodiles have pigs' eyes, large teeth and tusks, and strong 
<A NAME="425"></A>nails, and an impenetrable skin composed of scaly plates. They see but 
<A NAME="426"></A>poorly under water, but above the surface of it with remarkable acuteness. 
<A NAME="427"></A>As a rule, they pass the day-time on land and the nighttime in the water; 
<A NAME="428"></A>for the temperature of the water is at night-time more genial than that 
<A NAME="429"></A>of the open air.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="430"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="431"></A><BR><BR>The chameleon resembles the lizard in the general configuration 
<A NAME="432"></A>of its body, but the ribs stretch downwards and meet together under the 
<A NAME="433"></A>belly as is the case with fishes, and the spine sticks up as with the fish. 
<A NAME="434"></A>Its face resembles that of the baboon. Its tail is exceedingly long, terminates 
<A NAME="435"></A>in a sharp point, and is for the most part coiled up, like a strap of leather. 
<A NAME="436"></A>It stands higher off the ground than the lizard, but the flexure of the 
<A NAME="437"></A>legs is the same in both creatures. Each of its feet is divided into two 
<A NAME="438"></A>parts, which bear the same relation to one another that the thumb and the 
<A NAME="439"></A>rest of the hand bear to one another in man. Each of these parts is for 
<A NAME="440"></A>a short distance divided after a fashion into toes; on the front feet the 
<A NAME="441"></A>inside part is divided into three and the outside into two, on the hind 
<A NAME="442"></A>feet the inside part into two and the outside into three; it has claws 
<A NAME="443"></A>also on these parts resembling those of birds of prey. Its body is rough 
<A NAME="444"></A>all over, like that of the crocodile. Its eyes are situated in a hollow 
<A NAME="445"></A>recess, and are very large and round, and are enveloped in a skin resembling 
<A NAME="446"></A>that which covers the entire body; and in the middle a slight aperture 
<A NAME="447"></A>is left for vision, through which the animal sees, for it never covers 
<A NAME="448"></A>up this aperture with the cutaneous envelope. It keeps twisting its eyes 
<A NAME="449"></A>round and shifting its line of vision in every direction, and thus contrives 
<A NAME="450"></A>to get a sight of any object that it wants to see. The change in its colour 
<A NAME="451"></A>takes place when it is inflated with air; it is then black, not unlike 
<A NAME="452"></A>the crocodile, or green like the lizard but black-spotted like the pard. 
<A NAME="453"></A>This change of colour takes place over the whole body alike, for the eyes 
<A NAME="454"></A>and the tail come alike under its influence. In its movements it is very 
<A NAME="455"></A>sluggish, like the tortoise. It assumes a greenish hue in dying, and retains 
<A NAME="456"></A>this hue after death. It resembles the lizard in the position of the oesophagus 
<A NAME="457"></A>and the windpipe. It has no flesh anywhere except a few scraps of flesh 
<A NAME="458"></A>on the head and on the jaws and near to the root of the tail. It has blood 
<A NAME="459"></A>only round about the heart, the eyes, the region above the heart, and in 
<A NAME="460"></A>all the veins extending from these parts; and in all these there is but 
<A NAME="461"></A>little blood after all. The brain is situated a little above the eyes, 
<A NAME="462"></A>but connected with them. When the outer skin is drawn aside from off the 
<A NAME="463"></A>eye, a something is found surrounding the eye, that gleams through like 
<A NAME="464"></A>a thin ring of copper. Membranes extend well nigh over its entire frame, 
<A NAME="465"></A>numerous and strong, and surpassing in respect of number and relative strength 
<A NAME="466"></A>those found in any other animal. After being cut open along its entire 
<A NAME="467"></A>length it continues to breathe for a considerable time; a very slight motion 
<A NAME="468"></A>goes on in the region of the heart, and, while contraction is especially 
<A NAME="469"></A>manifested in the neighbourhood of the ribs, a similar motion is more or 
<A NAME="470"></A>less discernible over the whole body. It has no spleen visible. It hibernates, 
<A NAME="471"></A>like the lizard.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="472"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="473"></A><BR><BR>Birds also in some parts resemble the above mentioned animals; 
<A NAME="474"></A>that is to say, they have in all cases a head, a neck, a back, a belly, 
<A NAME="475"></A>and what is analogous to the chest. The bird is remarkable among animals 
<A NAME="476"></A>as having two feet, like man; only, by the way, it bends them backwards 
<A NAME="477"></A>as quadrupeds bend their hind legs, as was noticed previously. It has neither 
<A NAME="478"></A>hands nor front feet, but wings-an exceptional structure as compared with 
<A NAME="479"></A>other animals. Its haunch-bone is long, like a thigh, and is attached to 
<A NAME="480"></A>the body as far as the middle of the belly; so like to a thigh is it that 
<A NAME="481"></A>when viewed separately it looks like a real one, while the real thigh is 
<A NAME="482"></A>a separate structure betwixt it and the shin. Of all birds those that have 
<A NAME="483"></A>crooked talons have the biggest thighs and the strongest breasts. All birds 
<A NAME="484"></A>are furnished with many claws, and all have the toes separated more or 
<A NAME="485"></A>less asunder; that is to say, in the greater part the toes are clearly 
<A NAME="486"></A>distinct from one another, for even the swimming birds, although they are 
<A NAME="487"></A>web-footed, have still their claws fully articulated and distinctly differentiated 
<A NAME="488"></A>from one another. Birds that fly high in air are in all cases four-toed: 
<A NAME="489"></A>that is, the greater part have three toes in front and one behind in place 
<A NAME="490"></A>of a heel; some few have two in front and two behind, as the 
<A NAME="491"></A>wryneck.
<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>This latter bird is somewhat bigger than the chaffinch, and is 
<A NAME="493"></A>mottled in appearance. It is peculiar in the arrangement of its toes, and 
<A NAME="494"></A>resembles the snake in the structure of its tongue; for the creature can 
<A NAME="495"></A>protrude its tongue to the extent of four finger-breadths, and then draw 
<A NAME="496"></A>it back again. Moreover, it can twist its head backwards while keeping 
<A NAME="497"></A>all the rest of its body still, like the serpent. It has big claws, somewhat 
<A NAME="498"></A>resembling those of the woodpecker. Its note is a shrill 
<A NAME="499"></A>chirp.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>Birds are furnished with a mouth, but with an exceptional one, 
<A NAME="501"></A>for they have neither lips nor teeth, but a beak. Neither have they ears 
<A NAME="502"></A>nor a nose, but only passages for the sensations connected with these organs: 
<A NAME="503"></A>that for the nostrils in the beak, and that for hearing in the head. Like 
<A NAME="504"></A>all other animals they all have two eyes, and these are devoid of lashes. 
<A NAME="505"></A>The heavy-bodied (or gallinaceous) birds close the eye by means of the 
<A NAME="506"></A>lower lid, and all birds blink by means of a skin extending over the eye 
<A NAME="507"></A>from the inner corner; the owl and its congeners also close the eye by 
<A NAME="508"></A>means of the upper lid. The same phenomenon is observable in the animals 
<A NAME="509"></A>that are protected by horny scutes, as in the lizard and its congeners; 
<A NAME="510"></A>for they all without exception close the eye with the lower lid, but they 
<A NAME="511"></A>do not blink like birds. Further, birds have neither scutes nor hair, but 
<A NAME="512"></A>feathers; and the feathers are invariably furnished with quills. They have 
<A NAME="513"></A>no tail, but a rump with tail-feathers, short in such as are long-legged 
<A NAME="514"></A>and web-footed, large in others. These latter kinds of birds fly with their 
<A NAME="515"></A>feet tucked up close to the belly; but the small rumped or short-tailed 
<A NAME="516"></A>birds fly with their legs stretched out at full length. All are furnished 
<A NAME="517"></A>with a tongue, but the organ is variable, being long in some birds and 
<A NAME="518"></A>broad in others. Certain species of birds above all other animals, and 
<A NAME="519"></A>next after man, possess the faculty of uttering articulate sounds; and 
<A NAME="520"></A>this faculty is chiefly developed in broad-tongued birds. No oviparous 
<A NAME="521"></A>creature has an epiglottis over the windpipe, but these animals so manage 
<A NAME="522"></A>the opening and shutting of the windpipe as not to allow any solid substance 
<A NAME="523"></A>to get down into the lung.
<A NAME="524"></A><BR><BR>Some species of birds are furnished additionally with spurs, but 
<A NAME="525"></A>no bird with crooked talons is found so provided. The birds with talons 
<A NAME="526"></A>are among those that fly well, but those that have spurs are among the 
<A NAME="527"></A>heavy-bodied.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>Again, some birds have a crest. As a general rule the crest sticks 
<A NAME="529"></A>up, and is composed of feathers only; but the crest of the barn-door cock 
<A NAME="530"></A>is exceptional in kind, for, whereas it is not just exactly flesh, at the 
<A NAME="531"></A>same time it is not easy to say what else it is.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="532"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>Of water animals the genus of fishes constitutes a single group 
<A NAME="534"></A>apart from the rest, and including many diverse forms.
<A NAME="535"></A><BR><BR>In the first place, the fish has a head, a back, a belly, in the 
<A NAME="536"></A>neighbourhood of which last are placed the stomach and viscera; and behind 
<A NAME="537"></A>it has a tail of continuous, undivided shape, but not, by the way, in all 
<A NAME="538"></A>cases alike. No fish has a neck, or any limb, or testicles at all, within 
<A NAME="539"></A>or without, or breasts. But, by the way this absence of breasts may predicated 
<A NAME="540"></A>of all non-viviparous animals; and in point of fact viviparous animals 
<A NAME="541"></A>are not in all cases provided with the organ, excepting such as are directly 
<A NAME="542"></A>viviparous without being first oviparous. Thus the dolphin is directly 
<A NAME="543"></A>viviparous, and accordingly we find it furnished with two breasts, not 
<A NAME="544"></A>situated high up, but in the neighbourhood of the genitals. And this creature 
<A NAME="545"></A>is not provided, like quadrupeds, with visible teats, but has two vents, 
<A NAME="546"></A>one on each flank, from which the milk flows; and its young have to follow 
<A NAME="547"></A>after it to get suckled, and this phenomenon has been actually 
<A NAME="548"></A>witnessed.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>Fishes, then, as has been observed, have no breasts and no passage 
<A NAME="550"></A>for the genitals visible externally. But they have an exceptional organ 
<A NAME="551"></A>in the gills, whereby, after taking the water in the mouth, they discharge 
<A NAME="552"></A>it again; and in the fins, of which the greater part have four, and the 
<A NAME="553"></A>lanky ones two, as, for instance, the eel, and these two situated near 
<A NAME="554"></A>to the gills. In like manner the grey mullet-as, for instance, the mullet 
<A NAME="555"></A>found in the lake at Siphae-have only two fins; and the same is the case 
<A NAME="556"></A>with the fish called Ribbon-fish. Some of the lanky fishes have no fins 
<A NAME="557"></A>at all, such as the muraena, nor gills articulated like those of other 
<A NAME="558"></A>fish.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>And of those fish that are provided with gills, some have coverings 
<A NAME="560"></A>for this organ, whereas all the selachians have the organ unprotected by 
<A NAME="561"></A>a cover. And those fishes that have coverings or opercula for the gills 
<A NAME="562"></A>have in all cases their gills placed sideways; whereas, among selachians, 
<A NAME="563"></A>the broad ones have the gills down below on the belly, as the torpedo and 
<A NAME="564"></A>the ray, while the lanky ones have the organ placed sideways, as is the 
<A NAME="565"></A>case in all the dog-fish.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>The fishing-frog has gills placed sideways, and covered not with 
<A NAME="567"></A>a spiny operculum, as in all but the selachian fishes, but with one of 
<A NAME="568"></A>skin.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>Morever, with fishes furnished with gills, the gills in some cases 
<A NAME="570"></A>are simple in others duplicate; and the last gill in the direction of the 
<A NAME="571"></A>body is always simple. And, again, some fishes have few gills, and others 
<A NAME="572"></A>have a great number; but all alike have the same number on both sides. 
<A NAME="573"></A>Those that have the least number have one gill on either side, and this 
<A NAME="574"></A>one duplicate, like the boar-fish; others have two on either side, one 
<A NAME="575"></A>simple and the other duplicate, like the conger and the scarus; others 
<A NAME="576"></A>have four on either side, simple, as the elops, the synagris, the muraena, 
<A NAME="577"></A>and the eel; others have four, all, with the exception of the hindmost 
<A NAME="578"></A>one, in double rows, as the wrasse, the perch, the sheat-fish, and the 
<A NAME="579"></A>carp. The dog-fish have all their gills double, five on a side; and the 
<A NAME="580"></A>sword-fish has eight double gills. So much for the number of gills as found 
<A NAME="581"></A>in fishes.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>Again, fishes differ from other animals in more ways than as regards 
<A NAME="583"></A>the gills. For they are not covered with hairs as are viviparous land animals, 
<A NAME="584"></A>nor, as is the case with certain oviparous quadrupeds, with tessellated 
<A NAME="585"></A>scutes, nor, like birds, with feathers; but for the most part they are 
<A NAME="586"></A>covered with scales. Some few are rough-skinned, while the smooth-skinned 
<A NAME="587"></A>are very few indeed. Of the Selachia some are rough-skinned and some smooth-skinned; 
<A NAME="588"></A>and among the smooth-skinned fishes are included the conger, the eel, and 
<A NAME="589"></A>the tunny.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>All fishes are saw-toothed excepting the scarus; and the teeth 
<A NAME="591"></A>in all cases are sharp and set in many rows, and in some cases are placed 
<A NAME="592"></A>on the tongue. The tongue is hard and spiny, and so firmly attached that 
<A NAME="593"></A>fishes in many instances seem to be devoid of the organ altogether. The 
<A NAME="594"></A>mouth in some cases is wide-stretched, as it is with some viviparous 
<A NAME="595"></A>quadrupeds....
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>With regard to organs of sense, all save eyes, fishes possess none 
<A NAME="597"></A>of them, neither the organs nor their passages, neither ears nor nostrils; 
<A NAME="598"></A>but all fishes are furnished with eyes, and the eyes devoid of lids, though 
<A NAME="599"></A>the eyes are not hard; with regard to the organs connected with the other 
<A NAME="600"></A>senses, hearing and smell, they are devoid alike of the organs themselves 
<A NAME="601"></A>and of passages indicative of them.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR>Fishes without exception are supplied with blood. Some of them 
<A NAME="603"></A>are oviparous, and some viviparous; scaly fish are invariably oviparous, 
<A NAME="604"></A>but cartilaginous fishes are all viviparous, with the single exception 
<A NAME="605"></A>of the fishing-frog.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="606"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>Of blooded animals there now remains the serpent genus. This genus 
<A NAME="608"></A>is common to both elements, for, while most species comprehended therein 
<A NAME="609"></A>are land animals, a small minority, to wit the aquatic species, pass their 
<A NAME="610"></A>lives in fresh water. There are also sea-serpents, in shape to a great 
<A NAME="611"></A>extent resembling their congeners of the land, with this exception that 
<A NAME="612"></A>the head in their case is somewhat like the head of the conger; and there 
<A NAME="613"></A>are several kinds of sea-serpent, and the different kinds differ in colour; 
<A NAME="614"></A>these animals are not found in very deep water. Serpents, like fish, are 
<A NAME="615"></A>devoid of feet.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>There are also sea-scolopendras, resembling in shape their land 
<A NAME="617"></A>congeners, but somewhat less in regard to magnitude. These creatures are 
<A NAME="618"></A>found in the neighbourhood of rocks; as compared with their land congeners 
<A NAME="619"></A>they are redder in colour, are furnished with feet in greater numbers and 
<A NAME="620"></A>with legs of more delicate structure. And the same remark applies to them 
<A NAME="621"></A>as to the sea-serpents, that they are not found in very deep 
<A NAME="622"></A>water.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>Of fishes whose habitat is in the vicinity of rocks there is a 
<A NAME="624"></A>tiny one, which some call the Echeneis, or 'ship-holder', and which is 
<A NAME="625"></A>by some people used as a charm to bring luck in affairs of law and love. 
<A NAME="626"></A>The creature is unfit for eating. Some people assert that it has feet, 
<A NAME="627"></A>but this is not the case: it appears, however, to be furnished with feet 
<A NAME="628"></A>from the fact that its fins resemble those organs.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>So much, then, for the external parts of blooded animals, as regards 
<A NAME="630"></A>their numbers, their properties, and their relative 
<A NAME="631"></A>diversities.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="632"></A><B>Part 15</B>

<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>As for the properties of the internal organs, these we must first 
<A NAME="634"></A>discuss in the case of the animals that are supplied with blood. For the 
<A NAME="635"></A>principal genera differ from the rest of animals, in that the former are 
<A NAME="636"></A>supplied with blood and the latter are not; and the former include man, 
<A NAME="637"></A>viviparous and oviparous quadrupeds, birds, fishes, cetaceans, and all 
<A NAME="638"></A>the others that come under no general designation by reason of their not 
<A NAME="639"></A>forming genera, but groups of which simply the specific name is predicable, 
<A NAME="640"></A>as when we say 'the serpent,' the 'crocodile'.
<A NAME="641"></A><BR><BR>All viviparous quadrupeds, then, are furnished with an oesophagus 
<A NAME="642"></A>and a windpipe, situated as in man; the same statement is applicable to 
<A NAME="643"></A>oviparous quadrupeds and to birds, only that the latter present diversities 
<A NAME="644"></A>in the shapes of these organs. As a general rule, all animals that take 
<A NAME="645"></A>up air and breathe it in and out are furnished with a lung, a windpipe, 
<A NAME="646"></A>and an oesophagus, with the windpipe and oesophagus not admitting of diversity 
<A NAME="647"></A>in situation but admitting of diversity in properties, and with the lung 
<A NAME="648"></A>admitting of diversity in both these respects. Further, all blooded animals 
<A NAME="649"></A>have a heart and a diaphragm or midriff; but in small animals the existence 
<A NAME="650"></A>of the latter organ is not so obvious owing to its delicacy and minute 
<A NAME="651"></A>size.
<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>In regard to the heart there is an exceptional phenomenon observable 
<A NAME="653"></A>in oxen. In other words, there is one species of ox where, though not in 
<A NAME="654"></A>all cases, a bone is found inside the heart. And, by the way, the horse's 
<A NAME="655"></A>heart also has a bone inside it.
<A NAME="656"></A><BR><BR>The genera referred to above are not in all cases furnished with 
<A NAME="657"></A>a lung: for instance, the fish is devoid of the organ, as is also every 
<A NAME="658"></A>animal furnished with gills. All blooded animals are furnished with a liver. 
<A NAME="659"></A>As a general rule blooded animals are furnished with a spleen; but with 
<A NAME="660"></A>the great majority of non-viviparous but oviparous animals the spleen is 
<A NAME="661"></A>so small as all but to escape observation; and this is the case with almost 
<A NAME="662"></A>all birds, as with the pigeon, the kite, the falcon, the owl: in point 
<A NAME="663"></A>of fact, the aegocephalus is devoid of the organ altogether. With oviparous 
<A NAME="664"></A>quadrupeds the case is much the same as with the viviparous; that is to 
<A NAME="665"></A>say, they also have the spleen exceedingly minute, as the tortoise, the 
<A NAME="666"></A>freshwater tortoise, the toad, the lizard, the crocodile, and the 
<A NAME="667"></A>frog.
<A NAME="668"></A><BR><BR>Some animals have a gall-bladder close to the liver, and others 
<A NAME="669"></A>have not. Of viviparous quadrupeds the deer is without the organ, as also 
<A NAME="670"></A>the roe, the horse, the mule, the ass, the seal, and some kinds of pigs. 
<A NAME="671"></A>Of deer those that are called Achainae appear to have gall in their tail, 
<A NAME="672"></A>but what is so called does resemble gall in colour, though it is not so 
<A NAME="673"></A>completely fluid, and the organ internally resembles a 
<A NAME="674"></A>spleen.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR>However, without any exception, stags are found to have maggots 
<A NAME="676"></A>living inside the head, and the habitat of these creatures is in the hollow 
<A NAME="677"></A>underneath the root of the tongue and in the neighbourhood of the vertebra 
<A NAME="678"></A>to which the head is attached. These creatures are as large as the largest 
<A NAME="679"></A>grubs; they grow all together in a cluster, and they are usually about 
<A NAME="680"></A>twenty in number.
<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>Deer then, as has been observed, are without a gall-bladder; their 
<A NAME="682"></A>gut, however, is so bitter that even hounds refuse to eat it unless the 
<A NAME="683"></A>animal is exceptionally fat. With the elephant also the liver is unfurnished 
<A NAME="684"></A>with a gall-bladder, but when the animal is cut in the region where the 
<A NAME="685"></A>organ is found in animals furnished with it, there oozes out a fluid resembling 
<A NAME="686"></A>gall, in greater or less quantities. Of animals that take in sea-water 
<A NAME="687"></A>and are furnished with a lung, the dolphin is unprovided with a gall-bladder. 
<A NAME="688"></A>Birds and fishes all have the organ, as also oviparous quadrupeds, all 
<A NAME="689"></A>to a greater or a lesser extent. But of fishes some have the organ close 
<A NAME="690"></A>to the liver, as the dogfishes, the sheat-fish, the rhine or angel-fish, 
<A NAME="691"></A>the smooth skate, the torpedo, and, of the lanky fishes, the eel, the pipe-fish, 
<A NAME="692"></A>and the hammer-headed shark. The callionymus, also, has the gall-bladder 
<A NAME="693"></A>close to the liver, and in no other fish does the organ attain so great 
<A NAME="694"></A>a relative size. Other fishes have the organ close to the gut, attached 
<A NAME="695"></A>to the liver by certain extremely fine ducts. The bonito has the gall-bladder 
<A NAME="696"></A>stretched alongside the gut and equalling it in length, and often a double 
<A NAME="697"></A>fold of it. others have the organ in the region of the gut; in some cases 
<A NAME="698"></A>far off, in others near; as the fishing-frog, the elops, the synagris, 
<A NAME="699"></A>the muraena, and the sword-fish. Often animals of the same species show 
<A NAME="700"></A>this diversity of position; as, for instance, some congers are found with 
<A NAME="701"></A>the organ attached close to the liver, and others with it detached from 
<A NAME="702"></A>and below it. The case is much the same with birds: that is, some have 
<A NAME="703"></A>the gall-bladder close to the stomach, and others close to the gut, as 
<A NAME="704"></A>the pigeon, the raven, the quail, the swallow, and the sparrow; some have 
<A NAME="705"></A>it near at once to the liver and to the stomach as the aegocephalus; others 
<A NAME="706"></A>have it near at once to the liver and the gut, as the falcon and the 
<A NAME="707"></A>kite.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="708"></A><B>Part 16</B>

<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR>Again, all viviparous quadrupeds are furnished with kidneys and 
<A NAME="710"></A>a bladder. Of the ovipara that are not quadrupedal there is no instance 
<A NAME="711"></A>known of an animal, whether fish or bird, provided with these organs. Of 
<A NAME="712"></A>the ovipara that are quadrupedal, the turtle alone is provided with these 
<A NAME="713"></A>organs of a magnitude to correspond with the other organs of the animal. 
<A NAME="714"></A>In the turtle the kidney resembles the same organ in the ox; that is to 
<A NAME="715"></A>say, it looks one single organ composed of a number of small ones. (The 
<A NAME="716"></A>bison also resembles the ox in all its internal parts).
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="717"></A><B>Part 17</B>

<A NAME="718"></A><BR><BR>With all animals that are furnished with these parts, the parts 
<A NAME="719"></A>are similarly situated, and with the exception of man, the heart is in 
<A NAME="720"></A>the middle; in man, however, as has been observed, the heart is placed 
<A NAME="721"></A>a little to the left-hand side. In all animals the pointed end of the heart 
<A NAME="722"></A>turns frontwards; only in fish it would at first sight seem otherwise, 
<A NAME="723"></A>for the pointed end is turned not towards the breast, but towards the head 
<A NAME="724"></A>and the mouth. And (in fish) the apex is attached to a tube just where 
<A NAME="725"></A>the right and left gills meet together. There are other ducts extending 
<A NAME="726"></A>from the heart to each of the gills, greater in the greater fish, lesser 
<A NAME="727"></A>in the lesser; but in the large fishes the duct at the pointed end of the 
<A NAME="728"></A>heart is a tube, white-coloured and exceedingly thick. Fishes in some few 
<A NAME="729"></A>cases have an oesophagus, as the conger and the eel; and in these the organ 
<A NAME="730"></A>is small.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>In fishes that are furnished with an undivided liver, the organ 
<A NAME="732"></A>lies entirely on the right side; where the liver is cloven from the root, 
<A NAME="733"></A>the larger half of the organ is on the right side: for in some fishes the 
<A NAME="734"></A>two parts are detached from one another, without any coalescence at the 
<A NAME="735"></A>root, as is the case with the dogfish. And there is also a species of hare 
<A NAME="736"></A>in what is named the Fig district, near Lake Bolbe, and elsewhere, which 
<A NAME="737"></A>animal might be taken to have two livers owing to the length of the connecting 
<A NAME="738"></A>ducts, similar to the structure in the lung of birds.
<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>The spleen in all cases, when normally placed, is on the left-hand 
<A NAME="740"></A>side, and the kidneys also lie in the same position in all creatures that 
<A NAME="741"></A>possess them. There have been known instances of quadrupeds under dissection, 
<A NAME="742"></A>where the spleen was on the right hand and the liver on the left; but all 
<A NAME="743"></A>such cases are regarded as supernatural.
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR>In all animals the wind-pipe extends to the lung, and the manner 
<A NAME="745"></A>how, we shall discuss hereafter; and the oesophagus, in all that have the 
<A NAME="746"></A>organ, extends through the midriff into the stomach. For, by the way, as 
<A NAME="747"></A>has been observed, most fishes have no oesophagus, but the stomach is united 
<A NAME="748"></A>directly with the mouth, so that in some cases when big fish are pursuing 
<A NAME="749"></A>little ones, the stomach tumbles forward into the mouth.
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR>All the afore-mentioned animals have a stomach, and one similarly 
<A NAME="751"></A>situated, that is to say, situated directly under the midriff; and they 
<A NAME="752"></A>have a gut connected therewith and closing at the outlet of the residuum 
<A NAME="753"></A>and at what is termed the 'rectum'. However, animals present diversities 
<A NAME="754"></A>in the structure of their stomachs. In the first place, of the viviparous 
<A NAME="755"></A>quadrupeds, such of the horned animals as are not equally furnished with 
<A NAME="756"></A>teeth in both jaws are furnished with four such chambers. These animals, 
<A NAME="757"></A>by the way, are those that are said to chew the cud. In these animals the 
<A NAME="758"></A>oesophagus extends from the mouth downwards along the lung, from the midriff 
<A NAME="759"></A>to the big stomach (or paunch); and this stomach is rough inside and semi-partitioned. 
<A NAME="760"></A>And connected with it near to the entry of the oesophagus is what from 
<A NAME="761"></A>its appearance is termed the 'reticulum' (or honeycomb bag); for outside 
<A NAME="762"></A>it is like the stomach, but inside it resembles a netted cap; and the reticulum 
<A NAME="763"></A>is a great deal smaller than the stomach. Connected with this is the 'echinus' 
<A NAME="764"></A>(or many-plies), rough inside and laminated, and of about the same size 
<A NAME="765"></A>as the reticulum. Next after this comes what is called the 'enystrum' (or 
<A NAME="766"></A>abomasum), larger an longer than the echinus, furnished inside with numerous 
<A NAME="767"></A>folds or ridges, large and smooth. After all this comes the 
<A NAME="768"></A>gut.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR><BR>Such is the stomach of those quadrupeds that are horned and have 
<A NAME="770"></A>an unsymmetrical dentition; and these animals differ one from another in 
<A NAME="771"></A>the shape and size of the parts, and in the fact of the oesophagus reaching 
<A NAME="772"></A>the stomach centralwise in some cases and sideways in others. Animals that 
<A NAME="773"></A>are furnished equally with teeth in both jaws have one stomach; as man, 
<A NAME="774"></A>the pig, the dog, the bear, the lion, the wolf. (The Thos, by the by, has 
<A NAME="775"></A>all its internal organs similar to the wolf's.)
<A NAME="776"></A><BR><BR>All these, then have a single stomach, and after that the gut; 
<A NAME="777"></A>but the stomach in some is comparatively large, as in the pig and bear, 
<A NAME="778"></A>and the stomach of the pig has a few smooth folds or ridges; others have 
<A NAME="779"></A>a much smaller stomach, not much bigger than the gut, as the lion, the 
<A NAME="780"></A>dog, and man. In the other animals the shape of the stomach varies in the 
<A NAME="781"></A>direction of one or other of those already mentioned; that is, the stomach 
<A NAME="782"></A>in some animals resembles that of the pig; in others that of the dog, alike 
<A NAME="783"></A>with the larger animals and the smaller ones. In all these animals diversities 
<A NAME="784"></A>occur in regard to the size, the shape, the thickness or the thinness of 
<A NAME="785"></A>the stomach, and also in regard to the place where the oesophagus opens 
<A NAME="786"></A>into it.
<A NAME="787"></A><BR><BR>There is also a difference in structure in the gut of the two groups 
<A NAME="788"></A>of animals above mentioned (those with unsymmetrical and those with symmetrical 
<A NAME="789"></A>dentition) in size, in thickness, and in foldings.
<A NAME="790"></A><BR><BR>The intestines in those animals whose jaws are unequally furnished 
<A NAME="791"></A>with teeth are in all cases the larger, for the animals themselves are 
<A NAME="792"></A>larger than those in the other category; for very few of them are small, 
<A NAME="793"></A>and no single one of the horned animals is very small. And some possess 
<A NAME="794"></A>appendages (or caeca) to the gut, but no animal that has not incisors in 
<A NAME="795"></A>both jaws has a straight gut.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR><BR>The elephant has a gut constricted into chambers, so constructed 
<A NAME="797"></A>that the animal appears to have four stomachs; in it the food is found, 
<A NAME="798"></A>but there is no distinct and separate receptacle. Its viscera resemble 
<A NAME="799"></A>those of the pig, only that the liver is four times the size of that of 
<A NAME="800"></A>the ox, and the other viscera in like proportion, while the spleen is comparatively 
<A NAME="801"></A>small.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>Much the same may be predicated of the properties of the stomach 
<A NAME="803"></A>and the gut in oviparous quadrupeds, as in the land tortoise, the turtle, 
<A NAME="804"></A>the lizard, both crocodiles, and, in fact, in all animals of the like kind; 
<A NAME="805"></A>that is to say, their stomach is one and simple, resembling in some cases 
<A NAME="806"></A>that of the pig, and in other cases that of the dog.
<A NAME="807"></A><BR><BR>The serpent genus is similar and in almost all respects furnished 
<A NAME="808"></A>similarly to the saurians among land animals, if one could only imagine 
<A NAME="809"></A>these saurians to be increased in length and to be devoid of legs. That 
<A NAME="810"></A>is to say, the serpent is coated with tessellated scutes, and resembles 
<A NAME="811"></A>the saurian in its back and belly; only, by the way, it has no testicles, 
<A NAME="812"></A>but, like fishes, has two ducts converging into one, and an ovary long 
<A NAME="813"></A>and bifurcate. The rest of its internal organs are identical with those 
<A NAME="814"></A>of the saurians, except that, owing to the narrowness and length of the 
<A NAME="815"></A>animal, the viscera are correspondingly narrow and elongated, so that they 
<A NAME="816"></A>are apt to escape recognition from the similarities in shape. Thus, the 
<A NAME="817"></A>windpipe of the creature is exceptionally long, and the oesophagus is longer 
<A NAME="818"></A>still, and the windpipe commences so close to the mouth that the tongue 
<A NAME="819"></A>appears to be underneath it; and the windpipe seems to project over the 
<A NAME="820"></A>tongue, owing to the fact that the tongue draws back into a sheath and 
<A NAME="821"></A>does not remain in its place as in other animals. The tongue, moreover, 
<A NAME="822"></A>is thin and long and black, and can be protruded to a great distance. And 
<A NAME="823"></A>both serpents and saurians have this altogether exceptional property in 
<A NAME="824"></A>the tongue, that it is forked at the outer extremity, and this property 
<A NAME="825"></A>is the more marked in the serpent, for the tips of his tongue are as thin 
<A NAME="826"></A>as hairs. The seal, also, by the way, has a split tongue.
<A NAME="827"></A><BR><BR>The stomach of the serpent is like a more spacious gut, resembling 
<A NAME="828"></A>the stomach of the dog; then comes the gut, long, narrow, and single to 
<A NAME="829"></A>the end. The heart is situated close to the pharynx, small and kidney-shaped; 
<A NAME="830"></A>and for this reason the organ might in some cases appear not to have the 
<A NAME="831"></A>pointed end turned towards the breast. Then comes the lung, single, and 
<A NAME="832"></A>articulated with a membranous passage, very long, and quite detached from 
<A NAME="833"></A>the heart. The liver is long and simple; the spleen is short and round: 
<A NAME="834"></A>as is the case in both respects with the saurians. Its gall resembles that 
<A NAME="835"></A>of the fish; the water-snakes have it beside the liver, and the other snakes 
<A NAME="836"></A>have it usually beside the gut. These creatures are all saw-toothed. Their 
<A NAME="837"></A>ribs are as numerous as the days of the month; in other words, they are 
<A NAME="838"></A>thirty in number.
<A NAME="839"></A><BR><BR>Some affirm that the same phenomenon is observable with serpents 
<A NAME="840"></A>as with swallow chicks; in other words, they say that if you prick out 
<A NAME="841"></A>a serpent's eyes they will grow again. And further, the tails of saurians 
<A NAME="842"></A>and of serpents, if they be cut off, will grow again.
<A NAME="843"></A><BR><BR>With fishes the properties of the gut and stomach are similar; 
<A NAME="844"></A>that is, they have a stomach single and simple, but variable in shape according 
<A NAME="845"></A>to species. For in some cases the stomach is gut-shaped, as with the scarus, 
<A NAME="846"></A>or parrot-fish; which fish, by the way, appears to be the only fish that 
<A NAME="847"></A>chews the cud. And the whole length of the gut is simple, and if it have 
<A NAME="848"></A>a reduplication or kink it loosens out again into a simple 
<A NAME="849"></A>form.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR><BR>An exceptional property in fishes and in birds for the most part 
<A NAME="851"></A>is the being furnished with gut-appendages or caeca. Birds have them low 
<A NAME="852"></A>down and few in number. Fishes have them high up about the stomach, and 
<A NAME="853"></A>sometimes numerous, as in the goby, the galeos, the perch, the scorpaena, 
<A NAME="854"></A>the citharus, the red mullet, and the sparus; the cestreus or grey mullet 
<A NAME="855"></A>has several of them on one side of the belly, and on the other side only 
<A NAME="856"></A>one. Some fish possess these appendages but only in small numbers, as the 
<A NAME="857"></A>hepatus and the glaucus; and, by the way, they are few also in the dorado. 
<A NAME="858"></A>These fishes differ also from one another within the same species, for 
<A NAME="859"></A>in the dorado one individual has many and another few. Some fishes are 
<A NAME="860"></A>entirely without the part, as the majority of the selachians. As for all 
<A NAME="861"></A>the rest, some of them have a few and some a great many. And in all cases 
<A NAME="862"></A>where the gut-appendages are found in fish, they are found close up to 
<A NAME="863"></A>the stomach.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR><BR>In regard to their internal parts birds differ from other animals 
<A NAME="865"></A>and from one another. Some birds, for instance, have a crop in front of 
<A NAME="866"></A>the stomach, as the barn-door cock, the cushat, the pigeon, and the partridge; 
<A NAME="867"></A>and the crop consists of a large hollow skin, into which the food first 
<A NAME="868"></A>enters and where it lies ingested. Just where the crop leaves the oesophagus 
<A NAME="869"></A>it is somewhat narrow; by and by it broadens out, but where it communicates 
<A NAME="870"></A>with the stomach it narrows down again. The stomach (or gizzard) in most 
<A NAME="871"></A>birds is fleshy and hard, and inside is a strong skin which comes away 
<A NAME="872"></A>from the fleshy part. Other birds have no crop, but instead of it an oesophagus 
<A NAME="873"></A>wide and roomy, either all the way or in the part leading to the stomach, 
<A NAME="874"></A>as with the daw, the raven, and the carrion-crow. The quail also has the 
<A NAME="875"></A>oesophagus widened out at the lower extremity, and in the aegocephalus 
<A NAME="876"></A>and the owl the organ is slightly broader at the bottom than at the top. 
<A NAME="877"></A>The duck, the goose, the gull, the catarrhactes, and the great bustard 
<A NAME="878"></A>have the oesophagus wide and roomy from one end to the other, and the same 
<A NAME="879"></A>applies to a great many other birds. In some birds there is a portion of 
<A NAME="880"></A>the stomach that resembles a crop, as in the kestrel. In the case of small 
<A NAME="881"></A>birds like the swallow and the sparrow neither the oesophagus nor the crop 
<A NAME="882"></A>is wide, but the stomach is long. Some few have neither a crop nor a dilated 
<A NAME="883"></A>oesophagus, but the latter is exceedingly long, as in long necked birds, 
<A NAME="884"></A>such as the porphyrio, and, by the way, in the case of all these birds 
<A NAME="885"></A>the excrement is unusually moist. The quail is exceptional in regard to 
<A NAME="886"></A>these organs, as compared with other birds; in other words, it has a crop, 
<A NAME="887"></A>and at the same time its oesophagus is wide and spacious in front of the 
<A NAME="888"></A>stomach, and the crop is at some distance, relatively to its size, from 
<A NAME="889"></A>the oesophagus at that part.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR>Further, in most birds, the gut is thin, and simple when loosened 
<A NAME="891"></A>out. The gut-appendages or caeca in birds, as has been observed, are few 
<A NAME="892"></A>in number, and are not situated high up, as in fishes, but low down towards 
<A NAME="893"></A>the extremity of the gut. Birds, then, have caeca-not all, but the greater 
<A NAME="894"></A>part of them, such as the barn-door cock, the partridge, the duck, the 
<A NAME="895"></A>night-raven, (the localus,) the ascalaphus, the goose, the swan, the great 
<A NAME="896"></A>bustard, and the owl. Some of the little birds also have these appendages; 
<A NAME="897"></A>but the caeca in their case are exceedingly minute, as in the 
<A NAME="898"></A>sparrow.
