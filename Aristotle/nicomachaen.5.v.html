<A NAME="10"></A>1
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>With regards to justice and injustice we must (1) consider what 
<A NAME="12"></A>kind of actions they are concerned with, (2) what sort of mean justice 
<A NAME="13"></A>is, and (3) between what extremes the just act is intermediate. Our investigation 
<A NAME="14"></A>shall follow the same course as the preceding discussions.
<A NAME="15"></A><BR><BR>We see that all men mean by justice that kind of state of character 
<A NAME="16"></A>which makes people disposed to do what is just and makes them act justly 
<A NAME="17"></A>and wish for what is just; and similarly by injustice that state which 
<A NAME="18"></A>makes them act unjustly and wish for what is unjust. Let us too, then, 
<A NAME="19"></A>lay this down as a general basis. For the same is not true of the sciences 
<A NAME="20"></A>and the faculties as of states of character. A faculty or a science which 
<A NAME="21"></A>is one and the same is held to relate to contrary objects, but a state 
<A NAME="22"></A>of character which is one of two contraries does not produce the contrary 
<A NAME="23"></A>results; e.g. as a result of health we do not do what is the opposite of 
<A NAME="24"></A>healthy, but only what is healthy; for we say a man walks healthily, when 
<A NAME="25"></A>he walks as a healthy man would.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>Now often one contrary state is recognized from its contrary, and 
<A NAME="27"></A>often states are recognized from the subjects that exhibit them; for (A) 
<A NAME="28"></A>if good condition is known, bad condition also becomes known, and (B) good 
<A NAME="29"></A>condition is known from the things that are in good condition, and they 
<A NAME="30"></A>from it. If good condition is firmness of flesh, it is necessary both that 
<A NAME="31"></A>bad condition should be flabbiness of flesh and that the wholesome should 
<A NAME="32"></A>be that which causes firmness in flesh. And it follows for the most part 
<A NAME="33"></A>that if one contrary is ambiguous the other also will be ambiguous; e.g. 
<A NAME="34"></A>if 'just' is so, that 'unjust' will be so too.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>Now 'justice' and 'injustice' seem to be ambiguous, but because 
<A NAME="36"></A>their different meanings approach near to one another the ambiguity escapes 
<A NAME="37"></A>notice and is not obvious as it is, comparatively, when the meanings are 
<A NAME="38"></A>far apart, e.g. (for here the difference in outward form is great) as the 
<A NAME="39"></A>ambiguity in the use of kleis for the collar-bone of an animal and for 
<A NAME="40"></A>that with which we lock a door. Let us take as a starting-point, then, 
<A NAME="41"></A>the various meanings of 'an unjust man'. Both the lawless man and the grasping 
<A NAME="42"></A>and unfair man are thought to be unjust, so that evidently both the law-abiding 
<A NAME="43"></A>and the fair man will be just. The just, then, is the lawful and the fair, 
<A NAME="44"></A>the unjust the unlawful and the unfair.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>Since the unjust man is grasping, he must be concerned with goods-not 
<A NAME="46"></A>all goods, but those with which prosperity and adversity have to do, which 
<A NAME="47"></A>taken absolutely are always good, but for a particular person are not always 
<A NAME="48"></A>good. Now men pray for and pursue these things; but they should not, but 
<A NAME="49"></A>should pray that the things that are good absolutely may also be good for 
<A NAME="50"></A>them, and should choose the things that are good for them. The unjust man 
<A NAME="51"></A>does not always choose the greater, but also the less-in the case of things 
<A NAME="52"></A>bad absolutely; but because the lesser evil is itself thought to be in 
<A NAME="53"></A>a sense good, and graspingness is directed at the good, therefore he is 
<A NAME="54"></A>thought to be grasping. And he is unfair; for this contains and is common 
<A NAME="55"></A>to both.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>Since the lawless man was seen to be unjust and the law-abiding 
<A NAME="57"></A>man just, evidently all lawful acts are in a sense just acts; for the acts 
<A NAME="58"></A>laid down by the legislative art are lawful, and each of these, we say, 
<A NAME="59"></A>is just. Now the laws in their enactments on all subjects aim at the common 
<A NAME="60"></A>advantage either of all or of the best or of those who hold power, or something 
<A NAME="61"></A>of the sort; so that in one sense we call those acts just that tend to 
<A NAME="62"></A>produce and preserve happiness and its components for the political society. 
<A NAME="63"></A>And the law bids us do both the acts of a brave man (e.g. not to desert 
<A NAME="64"></A>our post nor take to flight nor throw away our arms), and those of a temperate 
<A NAME="65"></A>man (e.g. not to commit adultery nor to gratify one's lust), and those 
<A NAME="66"></A>of a good-tempered man (e.g. not to strike another nor to speak evil), 
<A NAME="67"></A>and similarly with regard to the other virtues and forms of wickedness, 
<A NAME="68"></A>commanding some acts and forbidding others; and the rightly-framed law 
<A NAME="69"></A>does this rightly, and the hastily conceived one less well. This form of 
<A NAME="70"></A>justice, then, is complete virtue, but not absolutely, but in relation 
<A NAME="71"></A>to our neighbour. And therefore justice is often thought to be the greatest 
<A NAME="72"></A>of virtues, and 'neither evening nor morning star' is so wonderful; and 
<A NAME="73"></A>proverbially 'in justice is every virtue comprehended'. And it is complete 
<A NAME="74"></A>virtue in its fullest sense, because it is the actual exercise of complete 
<A NAME="75"></A>virtue. It is complete because he who possesses it can exercise his virtue 
<A NAME="76"></A>not only in himself but towards his neighbour also; for many men can exercise 
<A NAME="77"></A>virtue in their own affairs, but not in their relations to their neighbour. 
<A NAME="78"></A>This is why the saying of Bias is thought to be true, that 'rule will show 
<A NAME="79"></A>the man'; for a ruler is necessarily in relation to other men and a member 
<A NAME="80"></A>of a society. For this same reason justice, alone of the virtues, is thought 
<A NAME="81"></A>to be 'another's good', because it is related to our neighbour; for it 
<A NAME="82"></A>does what is advantageous to another, either a ruler or a copartner. Now 
<A NAME="83"></A>the worst man is he who exercises his wickedness both towards himself and 
<A NAME="84"></A>towards his friends, and the best man is not he who exercises his virtue 
<A NAME="85"></A>towards himself but he who exercises it towards another; for this is a 
<A NAME="86"></A>difficult task. Justice in this sense, then, is not part of virtue but 
<A NAME="87"></A>virtue entire, nor is the contrary injustice a part of vice but vice entire. 
<A NAME="88"></A>What the difference is between virtue and justice in this sense is plain 
<A NAME="89"></A>from what we have said; they are the same but their essence is not the 
<A NAME="90"></A>same; what, as a relation to one's neighbour, is justice is, as a certain 
<A NAME="91"></A>kind of state without qualification, virtue.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>2
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>But at all events what we are investigating is the justice which 
<A NAME="94"></A>is a part of virtue; for there is a justice of this kind, as we maintain. 
<A NAME="95"></A>Similarly it is with injustice in the particular sense that we are 
<A NAME="96"></A>concerned.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>That there is such a thing is indicated by the fact that while 
<A NAME="98"></A>the man who exhibits in action the other forms of wickedness acts wrongly 
<A NAME="99"></A>indeed, but not graspingly (e.g. the man who throws away his shield through 
<A NAME="100"></A>cowardice or speaks harshly through bad temper or fails to help a friend 
<A NAME="101"></A>with money through meanness), when a man acts graspingly he often exhibits 
<A NAME="102"></A>none of these vices,-no, nor all together, but certainly wickedness of 
<A NAME="103"></A>some kind (for we blame him) and injustice. There is, then, another kind 
<A NAME="104"></A>of injustice which is a part of injustice in the wide sense, and a use 
<A NAME="105"></A>of the word 'unjust' which answers to a part of what is unjust in the wide 
<A NAME="106"></A>sense of 'contrary to the law'. Again if one man commits adultery for the 
<A NAME="107"></A>sake of gain and makes money by it, while another does so at the bidding 
<A NAME="108"></A>of appetite though he loses money and is penalized for it, the latter would 
<A NAME="109"></A>be held to be self-indulgent rather than grasping, but the former is unjust, 
<A NAME="110"></A>but not self-indulgent; evidently, therefore, he is unjust by reason of 
<A NAME="111"></A>his making gain by his act. Again, all other unjust acts are ascribed invariably 
<A NAME="112"></A>to some particular kind of wickedness, e.g. adultery to self-indulgence, 
<A NAME="113"></A>the desertion of a comrade in battle to cowardice, physical violence to 
<A NAME="114"></A>anger; but if a man makes gain, his action is ascribed to no form of wickedness 
<A NAME="115"></A>but injustice. Evidently, therefore, there is apart from injustice in the 
<A NAME="116"></A>wide sense another, 'particular', injustice which shares the name and nature 
<A NAME="117"></A>of the first, because its definition falls within the same genus; for the 
<A NAME="118"></A>significance of both consists in a relation to one's neighbour, but the 
<A NAME="119"></A>one is concerned with honour or money or safety-or that which includes 
<A NAME="120"></A>all these, if we had a single name for it-and its motive is the pleasure 
<A NAME="121"></A>that arises from gain; while the other is concerned with all the objects 
<A NAME="122"></A>with which the good man is concerned.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>It is clear, then, that there is more than one kind of justice, 
<A NAME="124"></A>and that there is one which is distinct from virtue entire; we must try 
<A NAME="125"></A>to grasp its genus and differentia.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>The unjust has been divided into the unlawful and the unfair, and 
<A NAME="127"></A>the just into the lawful and the fair. To the unlawful answers the afore-mentioned 
<A NAME="128"></A>sense of injustice. But since unfair and the unlawful are not the same, 
<A NAME="129"></A>but are different as a part is from its whole (for all that is unfair is 
<A NAME="130"></A>unlawful, but not all that is unlawful is unfair), the unjust and injustice 
<A NAME="131"></A>in the sense of the unfair are not the same as but different from the former 
<A NAME="132"></A>kind, as part from whole; for injustice in this sense is a part of injustice 
<A NAME="133"></A>in the wide sense, and similarly justice in the one sense of justice in 
<A NAME="134"></A>the other. Therefore we must speak also about particular justice and particular 
<A NAME="135"></A>and similarly about the just and the unjust. The justice, then, which answers 
<A NAME="136"></A>to the whole of virtue, and the corresponding injustice, one being the 
<A NAME="137"></A>exercise of virtue as a whole, and the other that of vice as a whole, towards 
<A NAME="138"></A>one's neighbour, we may leave on one side. And how the meanings of 'just' 
<A NAME="139"></A>and 'unjust' which answer to these are to be distinguished is evident; 
<A NAME="140"></A>for practically the majority of the acts commanded by the law are those 
<A NAME="141"></A>which are prescribed from the point of view of virtue taken as a whole; 
<A NAME="142"></A>for the law bids us practise every virtue and forbids us to practise any 
<A NAME="143"></A>vice. And the things that tend to produce virtue taken as a whole are those 
<A NAME="144"></A>of the acts prescribed by the law which have been prescribed with a view 
<A NAME="145"></A>to education for the common good. But with regard to the education of the 
<A NAME="146"></A>individual as such, which makes him without qualification a good man, we 
<A NAME="147"></A>must determine later whether this is the function of the political art 
<A NAME="148"></A>or of another; for perhaps it is not the same to be a good man and a good 
<A NAME="149"></A>citizen of any state taken at random.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>Of particular justice and that which is just in the corresponding 
<A NAME="151"></A>sense, (A) one kind is that which is manifested in distributions of honour 
<A NAME="152"></A>or money or the other things that fall to be divided among those who have 
<A NAME="153"></A>a share in the constitution (for in these it is possible for one man to 
<A NAME="154"></A>have a share either unequal or equal to that of another), and (B) one is 
<A NAME="155"></A>that which plays a rectifying part in transactions between man and man. 
<A NAME="156"></A>Of this there are two divisions; of transactions (1) some are voluntary 
<A NAME="157"></A>and (2) others involuntary- voluntary such transactions as sale, purchase, 
<A NAME="158"></A>loan for consumption, pledging, loan for use, depositing, letting (they 
<A NAME="159"></A>are called voluntary because the origin of these transactions is voluntary), 
<A NAME="160"></A>while of the involuntary (a) some are clandestine, such as theft, adultery, 
<A NAME="161"></A>poisoning, procuring, enticement of slaves, assassination, false witness, 
<A NAME="162"></A>and (b) others are violent, such as assault, imprisonment, murder, robbery 
<A NAME="163"></A>with violence, mutilation, abuse, insult.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>3
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>(A) We have shown that both the unjust man and the unjust act are 
<A NAME="166"></A>unfair or unequal; now it is clear that there is also an intermediate between 
<A NAME="167"></A>the two unequals involved in either case. And this is the equal; for in 
<A NAME="168"></A>any kind of action in which there's a more and a less there is also what 
<A NAME="169"></A>is equal. If, then, the unjust is unequal, just is equal, as all men suppose 
<A NAME="170"></A>it to be, even apart from argument. And since the equal is intermediate, 
<A NAME="171"></A>the just will be an intermediate. Now equality implies at least two things. 
<A NAME="172"></A>The just, then, must be both intermediate and equal and relative (i.e. 
<A NAME="173"></A>for certain persons). And since the equall intermediate it must be between 
<A NAME="174"></A>certain things (which are respectively greater and less); equal, it involves 
<A NAME="175"></A>two things; qua just, it is for certain people. The just, therefore, involves 
<A NAME="176"></A>at least four terms; for the persons for whom it is in fact just are two, 
<A NAME="177"></A>and the things in which it is manifested, the objects distributed, are 
<A NAME="178"></A>two. And the same equality will exist between the persons and between the 
<A NAME="179"></A>things concerned; for as the latter the things concerned-are related, so 
<A NAME="180"></A>are the former; if they are not equal, they will not have what is equal, 
<A NAME="181"></A>but this is the origin of quarrels and complaints-when either equals have 
<A NAME="182"></A>and are awarded unequal shares, or unequals equal shares. Further, this 
<A NAME="183"></A>is plain from the fact that awards should be 'according to merit'; for 
<A NAME="184"></A>all men agree that what is just in distribution must be according to merit 
<A NAME="185"></A>in some sense, though they do not all specify the same sort of merit, but 
<A NAME="186"></A>democrats identify it with the status of freeman, supporters of oligarchy 
<A NAME="187"></A>with wealth (or with noble birth), and supporters of aristocracy with 
<A NAME="188"></A>excellence.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>The just, then, is a species of the proportionate (proportion being 
<A NAME="190"></A>not a property only of the kind of number which consists of abstract units, 
<A NAME="191"></A>but of number in general). For proportion is equality of ratios, and involves 
<A NAME="192"></A>four terms at least (that discrete proportion involves four terms is plain, 
<A NAME="193"></A>but so does continuous proportion, for it uses one term as two and mentions 
<A NAME="194"></A>it twice; e.g. 'as the line A is to the line B, so is the line B to the 
<A NAME="195"></A>line C'; the line B, then, has been mentioned twice, so that if the line 
<A NAME="196"></A>B be assumed twice, the proportional terms will be four); and the just, 
<A NAME="197"></A>too, involves at least four terms, and the ratio between one pair is the 
<A NAME="198"></A>same as that between the other pair; for there is a similar distinction 
<A NAME="199"></A>between the persons and between the things. As the term A, then, is to 
<A NAME="200"></A>B, so will C be to D, and therefore, alternando, as A is to C, B will be 
<A NAME="201"></A>to D. Therefore also the whole is in the same ratio to the whole; and this 
<A NAME="202"></A>coupling the distribution effects, and, if the terms are so combined, effects 
<A NAME="203"></A>justly. The conjunction, then, of the term A with C and of B with D is 
<A NAME="204"></A>what is just in distribution, and this species of the just is intermediate, 
<A NAME="205"></A>and the unjust is what violates the proportion; for the proportional is 
<A NAME="206"></A>intermediate, and the just is proportional. (Mathematicians call this kind 
<A NAME="207"></A>of proportion geometrical; for it is in geometrical proportion that it 
<A NAME="208"></A>follows that the whole is to the whole as either part is to the corresponding 
<A NAME="209"></A>part.) This proportion is not continuous; for we cannot get a single term 
<A NAME="210"></A>standing for a person and a thing.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>This, then, is what the just is-the proportional; the unjust is 
<A NAME="212"></A>what violates the proportion. Hence one term becomes too great, the other 
<A NAME="213"></A>too small, as indeed happens in practice; for the man who acts unjustly 
<A NAME="214"></A>has too much, and the man who is unjustly treated too little, of what is 
<A NAME="215"></A>good. In the case of evil the reverse is true; for the lesser evil is reckoned 
<A NAME="216"></A>a good in comparison with the greater evil, since the lesser evil is rather 
<A NAME="217"></A>to be chosen than the greater, and what is worthy of choice is good, and 
<A NAME="218"></A>what is worthier of choice a greater good.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>This, then, is one species of the just.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR>4
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>(B) The remaining one is the rectificatory, which arises in connexion 
<A NAME="222"></A>with transactions both voluntary and involuntary. This form of the just 
<A NAME="223"></A>has a different specific character from the former. For the justice which 
<A NAME="224"></A>distributes common possessions is always in accordance with the kind of 
<A NAME="225"></A>proportion mentioned above (for in the case also in which the distribution 
<A NAME="226"></A>is made from the common funds of a partnership it will be according to 
<A NAME="227"></A>the same ratio which the funds put into the business by the partners bear 
<A NAME="228"></A>to one another); and the injustice opposed to this kind of justice is that 
<A NAME="229"></A>which violates the proportion. But the justice in transactions between 
<A NAME="230"></A>man and man is a sort of equality indeed, and the injustice a sort of inequality; 
<A NAME="231"></A>not according to that kind of proportion, however, but according to arithmetical 
<A NAME="232"></A>proportion. For it makes no difference whether a good man has defrauded 
<A NAME="233"></A>a bad man or a bad man a good one, nor whether it is a good or a bad man 
<A NAME="234"></A>that has committed adultery; the law looks only to the distinctive character 
<A NAME="235"></A>of the injury, and treats the parties as equal, if one is in the wrong 
<A NAME="236"></A>and the other is being wronged, and if one inflicted injury and the other 
<A NAME="237"></A>has received it. Therefore, this kind of injustice being an inequality, 
<A NAME="238"></A>the judge tries to equalize it; for in the case also in which one has received 
<A NAME="239"></A>and the other has inflicted a wound, or one has slain and the other been 
<A NAME="240"></A>slain, the suffering and the action have been unequally distributed; but 
<A NAME="241"></A>the judge tries to equalize by means of the penalty, taking away from the 
<A NAME="242"></A>gain of the assailant. For the term 'gain' is applied generally to such 
<A NAME="243"></A>cases, even if it be not a term appropriate to certain cases, e.g. to the 
<A NAME="244"></A>person who inflicts a woundand 'loss' to the sufferer; at all events when 
<A NAME="245"></A>the suffering has been estimated, the one is called loss and the other 
<A NAME="246"></A>gain. Therefore the equal is intermediate between the greater and the less, 
<A NAME="247"></A>but the gain and the loss are respectively greater and less in contrary 
<A NAME="248"></A>ways; more of the good and less of the evil are gain, and the contrary 
<A NAME="249"></A>is loss; intermediate between them is, as we saw, equal, which we say is 
<A NAME="250"></A>just; therefore corrective justice will be the intermediate between loss 
<A NAME="251"></A>and gain. This is why, when people dispute, they take refuge in the judge; 
<A NAME="252"></A>and to go to the judge is to go to justice; for the nature of the judge 
<A NAME="253"></A>is to be a sort of animate justice; and they seek the judge as an intermediate, 
<A NAME="254"></A>and in some states they call judges mediators, on the assumption that if 
<A NAME="255"></A>they get what is intermediate they will get what is just. The just, then, 
<A NAME="256"></A>is an intermediate, since the judge is so. Now the judge restores equality; 
<A NAME="257"></A>it is as though there were a line divided into unequal parts, and he took 
<A NAME="258"></A>away that by which the greater segment exceeds the half, and added it to 
<A NAME="259"></A>the smaller segment. And when the whole has been equally divided, then 
<A NAME="260"></A>they say they have 'their own'-i.e. when they have got what is equal. The 
<A NAME="261"></A>equal is intermediate between the greater and the lesser line according 
<A NAME="262"></A>to arithmetical proportion. It is for this reason also that it is called 
<A NAME="263"></A>just (sikaion), because it is a division into two equal parts (sicha), 
<A NAME="264"></A>just as if one were to call it sichaion; and the judge (sikastes) is one 
<A NAME="265"></A>who bisects (sichastes). For when something is subtracted from one of two 
<A NAME="266"></A>equals and added to the other, the other is in excess by these two; since 
<A NAME="267"></A>if what was taken from the one had not been added to the other, the latter 
<A NAME="268"></A>would have been in excess by one only. It therefore exceeds the intermediate 
<A NAME="269"></A>by one, and the intermediate exceeds by one that from which something was 
<A NAME="270"></A>taken. By this, then, we shall recognize both what we must subtract from 
<A NAME="271"></A>that which has more, and what we must add to that which has less; we must 
<A NAME="272"></A>add to the latter that by which the intermediate exceeds it, and subtract 
<A NAME="273"></A>from the greatest that by which it exceeds the intermediate. Let the lines 
<A NAME="274"></A>AA', BB', CC' be equal to one another; from the line AA' let the segment 
<A NAME="275"></A>AE have been subtracted, and to the line CC' let the segment Cd have been 
<A NAME="276"></A>added, so that the whole line DCC' exceeds the line EA' by the segment 
<A NAME="277"></A>CD and the segment CF; therefore it exceeds the line Bb' by the segment 
<A NAME="278"></A>CD. (See diagram.)
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>These names, both loss and gain, have come from voluntary exchange; 
<A NAME="280"></A>for to have more than one's own is called gaining, and to have less than 
<A NAME="281"></A>one's original share is called losing, e.g. in buying and selling and in 
<A NAME="282"></A>all other matters in which the law has left people free to make their own 
<A NAME="283"></A>terms; but when they get neither more nor less but just what belongs to 
<A NAME="284"></A>themselves, they say that they have their own and that they neither lose 
<A NAME="285"></A>nor gain.
<A NAME="286"></A><BR><BR>Therefore the just is intermediate between a sort of gain and a 
<A NAME="287"></A>sort of loss, viz. those which are involuntary; it consists in having an 
<A NAME="288"></A>equal amount before and after the transaction.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>5
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>Some think that reciprocity is without qualification just, as the 
<A NAME="291"></A>Pythagoreans said; for they defined justice without qualification as reciprocity. 
<A NAME="292"></A>Now 'reciprocity' fits neither distributive nor rectificatory justice-yet 
<A NAME="293"></A>people want even the justice of Rhadamanthus to mean 
<A NAME="294"></A>this:
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>Should a man suffer what he did, right justice would be done -for 
<A NAME="296"></A>in many cases reciprocity and rectificatory justice are not in accord; 
<A NAME="297"></A>e.g. (1) if an official has inflicted a wound, he should not be wounded 
<A NAME="298"></A>in return, and if some one has wounded an official, he ought not to be 
<A NAME="299"></A>wounded only but punished in addition. Further (2) there is a great difference 
<A NAME="300"></A>between a voluntary and an involuntary act. But in associations for exchange 
<A NAME="301"></A>this sort of justice does hold men together-reciprocity in accordance with 
<A NAME="302"></A>a proportion and not on the basis of precisely equal return. For it is 
<A NAME="303"></A>by proportionate requital that the city holds together. Men seek to return 
<A NAME="304"></A>either evil for evil-and if they cana not do so, think their position mere 
<A NAME="305"></A>slavery-or good for good-and if they cannot do so there is no exchange, 
<A NAME="306"></A>but it is by exchange that they hold together. This is why they give a 
<A NAME="307"></A>prominent place to the temple of the Graces-to promote the requital of 
<A NAME="308"></A>services; for this is characteristic of grace-we should serve in return 
<A NAME="309"></A>one who has shown grace to us, and should another time take the initiative 
<A NAME="310"></A>in showing it.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>Now proportionate return is secured by cross-conjunction. Let A 
<A NAME="312"></A>be a builder, B a shoemaker, C a house, D a shoe. The builder, then, must 
<A NAME="313"></A>get from the shoemaker the latter's work, and must himself give him in 
<A NAME="314"></A>return his own. If, then, first there is proportionate equality of goods, 
<A NAME="315"></A>and then reciprocal action takes place, the result we mention will be effected. 
<A NAME="316"></A>If not, the bargain is not equal, and does not hold; for there is nothing 
<A NAME="317"></A>to prevent the work of the one being better than that of the other; they 
<A NAME="318"></A>must therefore be equated. (And this is true of the other arts also; for 
<A NAME="319"></A>they would have been destroyed if what the patient suffered had not been 
<A NAME="320"></A>just what the agent did, and of the same amount and kind.) For it is not 
<A NAME="321"></A>two doctors that associate for exchange, but a doctor and a farmer, or 
<A NAME="322"></A>in general people who are different and unequal; but these must be equated. 
<A NAME="323"></A>This is why all things that are exchanged must be somehow comparable. It 
<A NAME="324"></A>is for this end that money has been introduced, and it becomes in a sense 
<A NAME="325"></A>an intermediate; for it measures all things, and therefore the excess and 
<A NAME="326"></A>the defect-how many shoes are equal to a house or to a given amount of 
<A NAME="327"></A>food. The number of shoes exchanged for a house (or for a given amount 
<A NAME="328"></A>of food) must therefore correspond to the ratio of builder to shoemaker. 
<A NAME="329"></A>For if this be not so, there will be no exchange and no intercourse. And 
<A NAME="330"></A>this proportion will not be effected unless the goods are somehow equal. 
<A NAME="331"></A>All goods must therefore be measured by some one thing, as we said before. 
<A NAME="332"></A>Now this unit is in truth demand, which holds all things together (for 
<A NAME="333"></A>if men did not need one another's goods at all, or did not need them equally, 
<A NAME="334"></A>there would be either no exchange or not the same exchange); but money 
<A NAME="335"></A>has become by convention a sort of representative of demand; and this is 
<A NAME="336"></A>why it has the name 'money' (nomisma)-because it exists not by nature but 
<A NAME="337"></A>by law (nomos) and it is in our power to change it and make it useless. 
<A NAME="338"></A>There will, then, be reciprocity when the terms have been equated so that 
<A NAME="339"></A>as farmer is to shoemaker, the amount of the shoemaker's work is to that 
<A NAME="340"></A>of the farmer's work for which it exchanges. But we must not bring them 
<A NAME="341"></A>into a figure of proportion when they have already exchanged (otherwise 
<A NAME="342"></A>one extreme will have both excesses), but when they still have their own 
<A NAME="343"></A>goods. Thus they are equals and associates just because this equality can 
<A NAME="344"></A>be effected in their case. Let A be a farmer, C food, B a shoemaker, D 
<A NAME="345"></A>his product equated to C. If it had not been possible for reciprocity to 
<A NAME="346"></A>be thus effected, there would have been no association of the parties. 
<A NAME="347"></A>That demand holds things together as a single unit is shown by the fact 
<A NAME="348"></A>that when men do not need one another, i.e. when neither needs the other 
<A NAME="349"></A>or one does not need the other, they do not exchange, as we do when some 
<A NAME="350"></A>one wants what one has oneself, e.g. when people permit the exportation 
<A NAME="351"></A>of corn in exchange for wine. This equation therefore must be established. 
<A NAME="352"></A>And for the future exchange-that if we do not need a thing now we shall 
<A NAME="353"></A>have it if ever we do need it-money is as it were our surety; for it must 
<A NAME="354"></A>be possible for us to get what we want by bringing the money. Now the same 
<A NAME="355"></A>thing happens to money itself as to goods-it is not always worth the same; 
<A NAME="356"></A>yet it tends to be steadier. This is why all goods must have a price set 
<A NAME="357"></A>on them; for then there will always be exchange, and if so, association 
<A NAME="358"></A>of man with man. Money, then, acting as a measure, makes goods commensurate 
<A NAME="359"></A>and equates them; for neither would there have been association if there 
<A NAME="360"></A>were not exchange, nor exchange if there were not equality, nor equality 
<A NAME="361"></A>if there were not commensurability. Now in truth it is impossible that 
<A NAME="362"></A>things differing so much should become commensurate, but with reference 
<A NAME="363"></A>to demand they may become so sufficiently. There must, then, be a unit, 
<A NAME="364"></A>and that fixed by agreement (for which reason it is called money); for 
<A NAME="365"></A>it is this that makes all things commensurate, since all things are measured 
<A NAME="366"></A>by money. Let A be a house, B ten minae, C a bed. A is half of B, if the 
<A NAME="367"></A>house is worth five minae or equal to them; the bed, C, is a tenth of B; 
<A NAME="368"></A>it is plain, then, how many beds are equal to a house, viz. five. That 
<A NAME="369"></A>exchange took place thus before there was money is plain; for it makes 
<A NAME="370"></A>no difference whether it is five beds that exchange for a house, or the 
<A NAME="371"></A>money value of five beds.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>We have now defined the unjust and the just. These having been 
<A NAME="373"></A>marked off from each other, it is plain that just action is intermediate 
<A NAME="374"></A>between acting unjustly and being unjustly treated; for the one is to have 
<A NAME="375"></A>too much and the other to have too little. Justice is a kind of mean, but 
<A NAME="376"></A>not in the same way as the other virtues, but because it relates to an 
<A NAME="377"></A>intermediate amount, while injustice relates to the extremes. And justice 
<A NAME="378"></A>is that in virtue of which the just man is said to be a doer, by choice, 
<A NAME="379"></A>of that which is just, and one who will distribute either between himself 
<A NAME="380"></A>and another or between two others not so as to give more of what is desirable 
<A NAME="381"></A>to himself and less to his neighbour (and conversely with what is harmful), 
<A NAME="382"></A>but so as to give what is equal in accordance with proportion; and similarly 
<A NAME="383"></A>in distributing between two other persons. Injustice on the other hand 
<A NAME="384"></A>is similarly related to the unjust, which is excess and defect, contrary 
<A NAME="385"></A>to proportion, of the useful or hurtful. For which reason injustice is 
<A NAME="386"></A>excess and defect, viz. because it is productive of excess and defect-in 
<A NAME="387"></A>one's own case excess of what is in its own nature useful and defect of 
<A NAME="388"></A>what is hurtful, while in the case of others it is as a whole like what 
<A NAME="389"></A>it is in one's own case, but proportion may be violated in either direction. 
<A NAME="390"></A>In the unjust act to have too little is to be unjustly treated; to have 
<A NAME="391"></A>too much is to act unjustly.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>Let this be taken as our account of the nature of justice and injustice, 
<A NAME="393"></A>and similarly of the just and the unjust in general.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>6
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>Since acting unjustly does not necessarily imply being unjust, 
<A NAME="396"></A>we must ask what sort of unjust acts imply that the doer is unjust with 
<A NAME="397"></A>respect to each type of injustice, e.g. a thief, an adulterer, or a brigand. 
<A NAME="398"></A>Surely the answer does not turn on the difference between these types. 
<A NAME="399"></A>For a man might even lie with a woman knowing who she was, but the origin 
<A NAME="400"></A>of his might be not deliberate choice but passion. He acts unjustly, then, 
<A NAME="401"></A>but is not unjust; e.g. a man is not a thief, yet he stole, nor an adulterer, 
<A NAME="402"></A>yet he committed adultery; and similarly in all other 
<A NAME="403"></A>cases.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>Now we have previously stated how the reciprocal is related to 
<A NAME="405"></A>the just; but we must not forget that what we are looking for is not only 
<A NAME="406"></A>what is just without qualification but also political justice. This is 
<A NAME="407"></A>found among men who share their life with a view to selfsufficiency, men 
<A NAME="408"></A>who are free and either proportionately or arithmetically equal, so that 
<A NAME="409"></A>between those who do not fulfil this condition there is no political justice 
<A NAME="410"></A>but justice in a special sense and by analogy. For justice exists only 
<A NAME="411"></A>between men whose mutual relations are governed by law; and law exists 
<A NAME="412"></A>for men between whom there is injustice; for legal justice is the discrimination 
<A NAME="413"></A>of the just and the unjust. And between men between whom there is injustice 
<A NAME="414"></A>there is also unjust action (though there is not injustice between all 
<A NAME="415"></A>between whom there is unjust action), and this is assigning too much to 
<A NAME="416"></A>oneself of things good in themselves and too little of things evil in themselves. 
<A NAME="417"></A>This is why we do not allow a man to rule, but rational principle, because 
<A NAME="418"></A>a man behaves thus in his own interests and becomes a tyrant. The magistrate 
<A NAME="419"></A>on the other hand is the guardian of justice, and, if of justice, then 
<A NAME="420"></A>of equality also. And since he is assumed to have no more than his share, 
<A NAME="421"></A>if he is just (for he does not assign to himself more of what is good in 
<A NAME="422"></A>itself, unless such a share is proportional to his merits-so that it is 
<A NAME="423"></A>for others that he labours, and it is for this reason that men, as we stated 
<A NAME="424"></A>previously, say that justice is 'another's good'), therefore a reward must 
<A NAME="425"></A>be given him, and this is honour and privilege; but those for whom such 
<A NAME="426"></A>things are not enough become tyrants.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>The justice of a master and that of a father are not the same as 
<A NAME="428"></A>the justice of citizens, though they are like it; for there can be no injustice 
<A NAME="429"></A>in the unqualified sense towards thing that are one's own, but a man's 
<A NAME="430"></A>chattel, and his child until it reaches a certain age and sets up for itself, 
<A NAME="431"></A>are as it were part of himself, and no one chooses to hurt himself (for 
<A NAME="432"></A>which reason there can be no injustice towards oneself). Therefore the 
<A NAME="433"></A>justice or injustice of citizens is not manifested in these relations; 
<A NAME="434"></A>for it was as we saw according to law, and between people naturally subject 
<A NAME="435"></A>to law, and these as we saw' are people who have an equal share in ruling 
<A NAME="436"></A>and being ruled. Hence justice can more truly be manifested towards a wife 
<A NAME="437"></A>than towards children and chattels, for the former is household justice; 
<A NAME="438"></A>but even this is different from political justice.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>7
<A NAME="440"></A><BR><BR>Of political justice part is natural, part legal, natural, that 
<A NAME="441"></A>which everywhere has the same force and does not exist by people's thinking 
<A NAME="442"></A>this or that; legal, that which is originally indifferent, but when it 
<A NAME="443"></A>has been laid down is not indifferent, e.g. that a prisoner's ransom shall 
<A NAME="444"></A>be a mina, or that a goat and not two sheep shall be sacrificed, and again 
<A NAME="445"></A>all the laws that are passed for particular cases, e.g. that sacrifice 
<A NAME="446"></A>shall be made in honour of Brasidas, and the provisions of decrees. Now 
<A NAME="447"></A>some think that all justice is of this sort, because that which is by nature 
<A NAME="448"></A>is unchangeable and has everywhere the same force (as fire burns both here 
<A NAME="449"></A>and in Persia), while they see change in the things recognized as just. 
<A NAME="450"></A>This, however, is not true in this unqualified way, but is true in a sense; 
<A NAME="451"></A>or rather, with the gods it is perhaps not true at all, while with us there 
<A NAME="452"></A>is something that is just even by nature, yet all of it is changeable; 
<A NAME="453"></A>but still some is by nature, some not by nature. It is evident which sort 
<A NAME="454"></A>of thing, among things capable of being otherwise, is by nature, and which 
<A NAME="455"></A>is not but is legal and conventional, assuming that both are equally changeable. 
<A NAME="456"></A>And in all other things the same distinction will apply; by nature the 
<A NAME="457"></A>right hand is stronger, yet it is possible that all men should come to 
<A NAME="458"></A>be ambidextrous. The things which are just by virtue of convention and 
<A NAME="459"></A>expediency are like measures; for wine and corn measures are not everywhere 
<A NAME="460"></A>equal, but larger in wholesale and smaller in retail markets. Similarly, 
<A NAME="461"></A>the things which are just not by nature but by human enactment are not 
<A NAME="462"></A>everywhere the same, since constitutions also are not the same, though 
<A NAME="463"></A>there is but one which is everywhere by nature the best. Of things just 
<A NAME="464"></A>and lawful each is related as the universal to its particulars; for the 
<A NAME="465"></A>things that are done are many, but of them each is one, since it is 
<A NAME="466"></A>universal.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>There is a difference between the act of injustice and what is 
<A NAME="468"></A>unjust, and between the act of justice and what is just; for a thing is 
<A NAME="469"></A>unjust by nature or by enactment; and this very thing, when it has been 
<A NAME="470"></A>done, is an act of injustice, but before it is done is not yet that but 
<A NAME="471"></A>is unjust. So, too, with an act of justice (though the general term is 
<A NAME="472"></A>rather 'just action', and 'act of justice' is applied to the correction 
<A NAME="473"></A>of the act of injustice).
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>Each of these must later be examined separately with regard to 
<A NAME="475"></A>the nature and number of its species and the nature of the things with 
<A NAME="476"></A>which it is concerned.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR>8
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>Acts just and unjust being as we have described them, a man acts 
<A NAME="479"></A>unjustly or justly whenever he does such acts voluntarily; when involuntarily, 
<A NAME="480"></A>he acts neither unjustly nor justly except in an incidental way; for he 
<A NAME="481"></A>does things which happen to be just or unjust. Whether an act is or is 
<A NAME="482"></A>not one of injustice (or of justice) is determined by its voluntariness 
<A NAME="483"></A>or involuntariness; for when it is voluntary it is blamed, and at the same 
<A NAME="484"></A>time is then an act of injustice; so that there will be things that are 
<A NAME="485"></A>unjust but not yet acts of injustice, if voluntariness be not present as 
<A NAME="486"></A>well. By the voluntary I mean, as has been said before, any of the things 
<A NAME="487"></A>in a man's own power which he does with knowledge, i.e. not in ignorance 
<A NAME="488"></A>either of the person acted on or of the instrument used or of the end that 
<A NAME="489"></A>will be attained (e.g. whom he is striking, with what, and to what end), 
<A NAME="490"></A>each such act being done not incidentally nor under compulsion (e.g. if 
<A NAME="491"></A>A takes B's hand and therewith strikes C, B does not act voluntarily; for 
<A NAME="492"></A>the act was not in his own power). The person struck may be the striker's 
<A NAME="493"></A>father, and the striker may know that it is a man or one of the persons 
<A NAME="494"></A>present, but not know that it is his father; a similar distinction may 
<A NAME="495"></A>be made in the case of the end, and with regard to the whole action. Therefore 
<A NAME="496"></A>that which is done in ignorance, or though not done in ignorance is not 
<A NAME="497"></A>in the agent's power, or is done under compulsion, is involuntary (for 
<A NAME="498"></A>many natural processes, even, we knowingly both perform and experience, 
<A NAME="499"></A>none of which is either voluntary or involuntary; e.g. growing old or dying). 
<A NAME="500"></A>But in the case of unjust and just acts alike the injustice or justice 
<A NAME="501"></A>may be only incidental; for a man might return a deposit unwillingly and 
<A NAME="502"></A>from fear, and then he must not be said either to do what is just or to 
<A NAME="503"></A>act justly, except in an incidental way. Similarly the man who under compulsion 
<A NAME="504"></A>and unwillingly fails to return the deposit must be said to act unjustly, 
<A NAME="505"></A>and to do what is unjust, only incidentally. Of voluntary acts we do some 
<A NAME="506"></A>by choice, others not by choice; by choice those which we do after deliberation, 
<A NAME="507"></A>not by choice those which we do without previous deliberation. Thus there 
<A NAME="508"></A>are three kinds of injury in transactions between man and man; those done 
<A NAME="509"></A>in ignorance are mistakes when the person acted on, the act, the instrument, 
<A NAME="510"></A>or the end that will be attained is other than the agent supposed; the 
<A NAME="511"></A>agent thought either that he was not hiting any one or that he was not 
<A NAME="512"></A>hitting with this missile or not hitting this person or to this end, but 
<A NAME="513"></A>a result followed other than that which he thought likely (e.g. he threw 
<A NAME="514"></A>not with intent to wound but only to prick), or the person hit or the missile 
<A NAME="515"></A>was other than he supposed. Now when (1) the injury takes place contrary 
<A NAME="516"></A>to reasonable expectation, it is a misadventure. When (2) it is not contrary 
<A NAME="517"></A>to reasonable expectation, but does not imply vice, it is a mistake (for 
<A NAME="518"></A>a man makes a mistake when the fault originates in him, but is the victim 
<A NAME="519"></A>of accident when the origin lies outside him). When (3) he acts with knowledge 
<A NAME="520"></A>but not after deliberation, it is an act of injustice-e.g. the acts due 
<A NAME="521"></A>to anger or to other passions necessary or natural to man; for when men 
<A NAME="522"></A>do such harmful and mistaken acts they act unjustly, and the acts are acts 
<A NAME="523"></A>of injustice, but this does not imply that the doers are unjust or wicked; 
<A NAME="524"></A>for the injury is not due to vice. But when (4) a man acts from choice, 
<A NAME="525"></A>he is an unjust man and a vicious man.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>Hence acts proceeding from anger are rightly judged not to be done 
<A NAME="527"></A>of malice aforethought; for it is not the man who acts in anger but he 
<A NAME="528"></A>who enraged him that starts the mischief. Again, the matter in dispute 
<A NAME="529"></A>is not whether the thing happened or not, but its justice; for it is apparent 
<A NAME="530"></A>injustice that occasions rage. For they do not dispute about the occurrence 
<A NAME="531"></A>of the act-as in commercial transactions where one of the two parties must 
<A NAME="532"></A>be vicious-unless they do so owing to forgetfulness; but, agreeing about 
<A NAME="533"></A>the fact, they dispute on which side justice lies (whereas a man who has 
<A NAME="534"></A>deliberately injured another cannot help knowing that he has done so), 
<A NAME="535"></A>so that the one thinks he is being treated unjustly and the other 
<A NAME="536"></A>disagrees.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>But if a man harms another by choice, he acts unjustly; and these 
<A NAME="538"></A>are the acts of injustice which imply that the doer is an unjust man, provided 
<A NAME="539"></A>that the act violates proportion or equality. Similarly, a man is just 
<A NAME="540"></A>when he acts justly by choice; but he acts justly if he merely acts 
<A NAME="541"></A>voluntarily.
<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>Of involuntary acts some are excusable, others not. For the mistakes 
<A NAME="543"></A>which men make not only in ignorance but also from ignorance are excusable, 
<A NAME="544"></A>while those which men do not from ignorance but (though they do them in 
<A NAME="545"></A>ignorance) owing to a passion which is neither natural nor such as man 
<A NAME="546"></A>is liable to, are not excusable.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>9
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR>Assuming that we have sufficiently defined the suffering and doing 
<A NAME="549"></A>of injustice, it may be asked (1) whether the truth in expressed in Euripides' 
<A NAME="550"></A>paradoxical words:
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR>I slew my mother, that's my tale in brief.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR>Were you both willing, or unwilling both?
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>Is it truly possible to be willingly treated unjustly, or is all 
<A NAME="554"></A>suffering of injustice the contrary involuntary, as all unjust action is 
<A NAME="555"></A>voluntary? And is all suffering of injustice of the latter kind or else 
<A NAME="556"></A>all of the former, or is it sometimes voluntary, sometimes involuntary? 
<A NAME="557"></A>So, too, with the case of being justly treated; all just action is voluntary, 
<A NAME="558"></A>so that it is reasonable that there should be a similar opposition in either 
<A NAME="559"></A>case-that both being unjustly and being justly treated should be either 
<A NAME="560"></A>alike voluntary or alike involuntary. But it would be thought paradoxical 
<A NAME="561"></A>even in the case of being justly treated, if it were always voluntary; 
<A NAME="562"></A>for some are unwillingly treated justly. (2) One might raise this question 
<A NAME="563"></A>also, whether every one who has suffered what is unjust is being unjustly 
<A NAME="564"></A>treated, or on the other hand it is with suffering as with acting. In action 
<A NAME="565"></A>and in passivity alike it is possible to partake of justice incidentally, 
<A NAME="566"></A>and similarly (it is plain) of injustice; for to do what is unjust is not 
<A NAME="567"></A>the same as to act unjustly, nor to suffer what is unjust as to be treated 
<A NAME="568"></A>unjustly, and similarly in the case of acting justly and being justly treated; 
<A NAME="569"></A>for it is impossible to be unjustly treated if the other does not act unjustly, 
<A NAME="570"></A>or justly treated unless he acts justly. Now if to act unjustly is simply 
<A NAME="571"></A>to harm some one voluntarily, and 'voluntarily' means 'knowing the person 
<A NAME="572"></A>acted on, the instrument, and the manner of one's acting', and the incontinent 
<A NAME="573"></A>man voluntarily harms himself, not only will he voluntarily be unjustly 
<A NAME="574"></A>treated but it will be possible to treat oneself unjustly. (This also is 
<A NAME="575"></A>one of the questions in doubt, whether a man can treat himself unjustly.) 
<A NAME="576"></A>Again, a man may voluntarily, owing to incontinence, be harmed by another 
<A NAME="577"></A>who acts voluntarily, so that it would be possible to be voluntarily treated 
<A NAME="578"></A>unjustly. Or is our definition incorrect; must we to 'harming another, 
<A NAME="579"></A>with knowledge both of the person acted on, of the instrument, and of the 
<A NAME="580"></A>manner' add 'contrary to the wish of the person acted on'? Then a man may 
<A NAME="581"></A>be voluntarily harmed and voluntarily suffer what is unjust, but no one 
<A NAME="582"></A>is voluntarily treated unjustly; for no one wishes to be unjustly treated, 
<A NAME="583"></A>not even the incontinent man. He acts contrary to his wish; for no one 
<A NAME="584"></A>wishes for what he does not think to be good, but the incontinent man does 
<A NAME="585"></A>do things that he does not think he ought to do. Again, one who gives what 
<A NAME="586"></A>is his own, as Homer says Glaucus gave Diomede
<A NAME="587"></A><BR><BR>Armour of gold for brazen, the price of a hundred beeves for nine, 
<A NAME="588"></A>is not unjustly treated; for though to give is in his power, to be unjustly 
<A NAME="589"></A>treated is not, but there must be some one to treat him unjustly. It is 
<A NAME="590"></A>plain, then, that being unjustly treated is not voluntary.
<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR>Of the questions we intended to discuss two still remain for discussion; 
<A NAME="592"></A>(3) whether it is the man who has assigned to another more than his share 
<A NAME="593"></A>that acts unjustly, or he who has the excessive share, and (4) whether 
<A NAME="594"></A>it is possible to treat oneself unjustly. The questions are connected; 
<A NAME="595"></A>for if the former alternative is possible and the distributor acts unjustly 
<A NAME="596"></A>and not the man who has the excessive share, then if a man assigns more 
<A NAME="597"></A>to another than to himself, knowingly and voluntarily, he treats himself 
<A NAME="598"></A>unjustly; which is what modest people seem to do, since the virtuous man 
<A NAME="599"></A>tends to take less than his share. Or does this statement too need qualification? 
<A NAME="600"></A>For (a) he perhaps gets more than his share of some other good, e.g. of 
<A NAME="601"></A>honour or of intrinsic nobility. (b) The question is solved by applying 
<A NAME="602"></A>the distinction we applied to unjust action; for he suffers nothing contrary 
<A NAME="603"></A>to his own wish, so that he is not unjustly treated as far as this goes, 
<A NAME="604"></A>but at most only suffers harm.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>It is plain too that the distributor acts unjustly, but not always 
<A NAME="606"></A>the man who has the excessive share; for it is not he to whom what is unjust 
<A NAME="607"></A>appertains that acts unjustly, but he to whom it appertains to do the unjust 
<A NAME="608"></A>act voluntarily, i.e. the person in whom lies the origin of the action, 
<A NAME="609"></A>and this lies in the distributor, not in the receiver. Again, since the 
<A NAME="610"></A>word 'do' is ambiguous, and there is a sense in which lifeless things, 
<A NAME="611"></A>or a hand, or a servant who obeys an order, may be said to slay, he who 
<A NAME="612"></A>gets an excessive share does not act unjustly, though he 'does' what is 
<A NAME="613"></A>unjust.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>Again, if the distributor gave his judgement in ignorance, he does 
<A NAME="615"></A>not act unjustly in respect of legal justice, and his judgement is not 
<A NAME="616"></A>unjust in this sense, but in a sense it is unjust (for legal justice and 
<A NAME="617"></A>primordial justice are different); but if with knowledge he judged unjustly, 
<A NAME="618"></A>he is himself aiming at an excessive share either of gratitude or of revenge. 
<A NAME="619"></A>As much, then, as if he were to share in the plunder, the man who has judged 
<A NAME="620"></A>unjustly for these reasons has got too much; the fact that what he gets 
<A NAME="621"></A>is different from what he distributes makes no difference, for even if 
<A NAME="622"></A>he awards land with a view to sharing in the plunder he gets not land but 
<A NAME="623"></A>money.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>Men think that acting unjustly is in their power, and therefore 
<A NAME="625"></A>that being just is easy. But it is not; to lie with one's neighbour's wife, 
<A NAME="626"></A>to wound another, to deliver a bribe, is easy and in our power, but to 
<A NAME="627"></A>do these things as a result of a certain state of character is neither 
<A NAME="628"></A>easy nor in our power. Similarly to know what is just and what is unjust 
<A NAME="629"></A>requires, men think, no great wisdom, because it is not hard to understand 
<A NAME="630"></A>the matters dealt with by the laws (though these are not the things that 
<A NAME="631"></A>are just, except incidentally); but how actions must be done and distributions 
<A NAME="632"></A>effected in order to be just, to know this is a greater achievement than 
<A NAME="633"></A>knowing what is good for the health; though even there, while it is easy 
<A NAME="634"></A>to know that honey, wine, hellebore, cautery, and the use of the knife 
<A NAME="635"></A>are so, to know how, to whom, and when these should be applied with a view 
<A NAME="636"></A>to producing health, is no less an achievement than that of being a physician. 
<A NAME="637"></A>Again, for this very reason men think that acting unjustly is characteristic 
<A NAME="638"></A>of the just man no less than of the unjust, because he would be not less 
<A NAME="639"></A>but even more capable of doing each of these unjust acts; for he could 
<A NAME="640"></A>lie with a woman or wound a neighbour; and the brave man could throw away 
<A NAME="641"></A>his shield and turn to flight in this direction or in that. But to play 
<A NAME="642"></A>the coward or to act unjustly consists not in doing these things, except 
<A NAME="643"></A>incidentally, but in doing them as the result of a certain state of character, 
<A NAME="644"></A>just as to practise medicine and healing consists not in applying or not 
<A NAME="645"></A>applying the knife, in using or not using medicines, but in doing so in 
<A NAME="646"></A>a certain way.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR>Just acts occur between people who participate in things good in 
<A NAME="648"></A>themselves and can have too much or too little of them; for some beings 
<A NAME="649"></A>(e.g. presumably the gods) cannot have too much of them, and to others, 
<A NAME="650"></A>those who are incurably bad, not even the smallest share in them is beneficial 
<A NAME="651"></A>but all such goods are harmful, while to others they are beneficial up 
<A NAME="652"></A>to a point; therefore justice is essentially something 
<A NAME="653"></A>human.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>10
<A NAME="655"></A><BR>Our next subject is equity and the equitable (to epiekes), and their 
<A NAME="656"></A>respective relations to justice and the just. For on examination they appear 
<A NAME="657"></A>to be neither absolutely the same nor generically different; and while 
<A NAME="658"></A>we sometime praise what is equitable and the equitable man (so that we 
<A NAME="659"></A>apply the name by way of praise even to instances of the other virtues, 
<A NAME="660"></A>instead of 'good' meaning by epieikestebon that a thing is better), at 
<A NAME="661"></A>other times, when we reason it out, it seems strange if the equitable, 
<A NAME="662"></A>being something different from the just, is yet praiseworthy; for either 
<A NAME="663"></A>the just or the equitable is not good, if they are different; or, if both 
<A NAME="664"></A>are good, they are the same.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR>These, then, are pretty much the considerations that give rise 
<A NAME="666"></A>to the problem about the equitable; they are all in a sense correct and 
<A NAME="667"></A>not opposed to one another; for the equitable, though it is better than 
<A NAME="668"></A>one kind of justice, yet is just, and it is not as being a different class 
<A NAME="669"></A>of thing that it is better than the just. The same thing, then, is just 
<A NAME="670"></A>and equitable, and while both are good the equitable is superior. What 
<A NAME="671"></A>creates the problem is that the equitable is just, but not the legally 
<A NAME="672"></A>just but a correction of legal justice. The reason is that all law is universal 
<A NAME="673"></A>but about some things it is not possible to make a universal statement 
<A NAME="674"></A>which shall be correct. In those cases, then, in which it is necessary 
<A NAME="675"></A>to speak universally, but not possible to do so correctly, the law takes 
<A NAME="676"></A>the usual case, though it is not ignorant of the possibility of error. 
<A NAME="677"></A>And it is none the less correct; for the error is in the law nor in the 
<A NAME="678"></A>legislator but in the nature of the thing, since the matter of practical 
<A NAME="679"></A>affairs is of this kind from the start. When the law speaks universally, 
<A NAME="680"></A>then, and a case arises on it which is not covered by the universal statement, 
<A NAME="681"></A>then it is right, where the legislator fails us and has erred by oversimplicity, 
<A NAME="682"></A>to correct the omission-to say what the legislator himself would have said 
<A NAME="683"></A>had he been present, and would have put into his law if he had known. Hence 
<A NAME="684"></A>the equitable is just, and better than one kind of justice-not better than 
<A NAME="685"></A>absolute justice but better than the error that arises from the absoluteness 
<A NAME="686"></A>of the statement. And this is the nature of the equitable, a correction 
<A NAME="687"></A>of law where it is defective owing to its universality. In fact this is 
<A NAME="688"></A>the reason why all things are not determined by law, that about some things 
<A NAME="689"></A>it is impossible to lay down a law, so that a decree is needed. For when 
<A NAME="690"></A>the thing is indefinite the rule also is indefinite, like the leaden rule 
<A NAME="691"></A>used in making the Lesbian moulding; the rule adapts itself to the shape 
<A NAME="692"></A>of the stone and is not rigid, and so too the decree is adapted to the 
<A NAME="693"></A>facts.
<A NAME="694"></A><BR><BR>It is plain, then, what the equitable is, and that it is just and 
<A NAME="695"></A>is better than one kind of justice. It is evident also from this who the 
<A NAME="696"></A>equitable man is; the man who chooses and does such acts, and is no stickler 
<A NAME="697"></A>for his rights in a bad sense but tends to take less than his share though 
<A NAME="698"></A>he has the law oft his side, is equitable, and this state of character 
<A NAME="699"></A>is equity, which is a sort of justice and not a different state of 
<A NAME="700"></A>character.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR>11
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>Whether a man can treat himself unjustly or not, is evident from 
<A NAME="703"></A>what has been said. For (a) one class of just acts are those acts in accordance 
<A NAME="704"></A>with any virtue which are prescribed by the law; e.g. the law does not 
<A NAME="705"></A>expressly permit suicide, and what it does not expressly permit it forbids. 
<A NAME="706"></A>Again, when a man in violation of the law harms another (otherwise than 
<A NAME="707"></A>in retaliation) voluntarily, he acts unjustly, and a voluntary agent is 
<A NAME="708"></A>one who knows both the person he is affecting by his action and the instrument 
<A NAME="709"></A>he is using; and he who through anger voluntarily stabs himself does this 
<A NAME="710"></A>contrary to the right rule of life, and this the law does not allow; therefore 
<A NAME="711"></A>he is acting unjustly. But towards whom? Surely towards the state, not 
<A NAME="712"></A>towards himself. For he suffers voluntarily, but no one is voluntarily 
<A NAME="713"></A>treated unjustly. This is also the reason why the state punishes; a certain 
<A NAME="714"></A>loss of civil rights attaches to the man who destroys himself, on the ground 
<A NAME="715"></A>that he is treating the state unjustly.
<A NAME="716"></A><BR><BR>Further (b) in that sense of 'acting unjustly' in which the man 
<A NAME="717"></A>who 'acts unjustly' is unjust only and not bad all round, it is not possible 
<A NAME="718"></A>to treat oneself unjustly (this is different from the former sense; the 
<A NAME="719"></A>unjust man in one sense of the term is wicked in a particularized way just 
<A NAME="720"></A>as the coward is, not in the sense of being wicked all round, so that his 
<A NAME="721"></A>'unjust act' does not manifest wickedness in general). For (i) that would 
<A NAME="722"></A>imply the possibility of the same thing's having been subtracted from and 
<A NAME="723"></A>added to the same thing at the same time; but this is impossible-the just 
<A NAME="724"></A>and the unjust always involve more than one person. Further, (ii) unjust 
<A NAME="725"></A>action is voluntary and done by choice, and takes the initiative (for the 
<A NAME="726"></A>man who because he has suffered does the same in return is not thought 
<A NAME="727"></A>to act unjustly); but if a man harms himself he suffers and does the same 
<A NAME="728"></A>things at the same time. Further, (iii) if a man could treat himself unjustly, 
<A NAME="729"></A>he could be voluntarily treated unjustly. Besides, (iv) no one acts unjustly 
<A NAME="730"></A>without committing particular acts of injustice; but no one can commit 
<A NAME="731"></A>adultery with his own wife or housebreaking on his own house or theft on 
<A NAME="732"></A>his own property,
<A NAME="733"></A><BR><BR>In general, the question 'can a man treat himself unjustly?' is 
<A NAME="734"></A>solved also by the distinction we applied to the question 'can a man be 
<A NAME="735"></A>voluntarily treated unjustly?'
<A NAME="736"></A><BR><BR>(It is evident too that both are bad, being unjustly treated and 
<A NAME="737"></A>acting unjustly; for the one means having less and the other having more 
<A NAME="738"></A>than the intermediate amount, which plays the part here that the healthy 
<A NAME="739"></A>does in the medical art, and that good condition does in the art of bodily 
<A NAME="740"></A>training. But still acting unjustly is the worse, for it involves vice 
<A NAME="741"></A>and is blameworthy-involves vice which is either of the complete and unqualified 
<A NAME="742"></A>kind or almost so (we must admit the latter alternative, because not all 
<A NAME="743"></A>voluntary unjust action implies injustice as a state of character), while 
<A NAME="744"></A>being unjustly treated does not involve vice and injustice in oneself. 
<A NAME="745"></A>In itself, then, being unjustly treated is less bad, but there is nothing 
<A NAME="746"></A>to prevent its being incidentally a greater evil. But theory cares nothing 
<A NAME="747"></A>for this; it calls pleurisy a more serious mischief than a stumble; yet 
<A NAME="748"></A>the latter may become incidentally the more serious, if the fall due to 
<A NAME="749"></A>it leads to your being taken prisoner or put to death the 
<A NAME="750"></A>enemy.)
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR>Metaphorically and in virtue of a certain resemblance there is 
<A NAME="752"></A>a justice, not indeed between a man and himself, but between certain parts 
<A NAME="753"></A>of him; yet not every kind of justice but that of master and servant or 
<A NAME="754"></A>that of husband and wife. For these are the ratios in which the part of 
<A NAME="755"></A>the soul that has a rational principle stands to the irrational part; and 
<A NAME="756"></A>it is with a view to these parts that people also think a man can be unjust 
<A NAME="757"></A>to himself, viz. because these parts are liable to suffer something contrary 
<A NAME="758"></A>to their respective desires; there is therefore thought to be a mutual 
<A NAME="759"></A>justice between them as between ruler and ruled.
<A NAME="760"></A><BR><BR>Let this be taken as our account of justice and the other, i.e. 
<A NAME="761"></A>the other moral, virtues.
