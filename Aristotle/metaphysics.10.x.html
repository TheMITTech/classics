<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>"WE have said previously, in our distinction of the various meanings 
<A NAME="13"></A>of words, that 'one' has several meanings; the things that are directly 
<A NAME="14"></A>and of their own nature and not accidentally called one may be summarized 
<A NAME="15"></A>under four heads, though the word is used in more senses. (1) There is 
<A NAME="16"></A>the continuous, either in general, or especially that which is continuous 
<A NAME="17"></A>by nature and not by contact nor by being together; and of these, that 
<A NAME="18"></A>has more unity and is prior, whose movement is more indivisible and simpler. 
<A NAME="19"></A>(2) That which is a whole and has a certain shape and form is one in a 
<A NAME="20"></A>still higher degree; and especially if a thing is of this sort by nature, 
<A NAME="21"></A>and not by force like the things which are unified by glue or nails or 
<A NAME="22"></A>by being tied together, i.e. if it has in itself the cause of its continuity. 
<A NAME="23"></A>A thing is of this sort because its movement is one and indivisible in 
<A NAME="24"></A>place and time; so that evidently if a thing has by nature a principle 
<A NAME="25"></A>of movement that is of the first kind (i.e. local movement) and the first 
<A NAME="26"></A>in that kind (i.e. circular movement), this is in the primary sense one 
<A NAME="27"></A>extended thing. Some things, then, are one in this way, qua continuous 
<A NAME="28"></A>or whole, and the other things that are one are those whose definition 
<A NAME="29"></A>is one. Of this sort are the things the thought of which is one, i.e. those 
<A NAME="30"></A>the thought of which is indivisible; and it is indivisible if the thing 
<A NAME="31"></A>is indivisible in kind or in number. (3) In number, then, the individual 
<A NAME="32"></A>is indivisible, and (4) in kind, that which in intelligibility and in knowledge 
<A NAME="33"></A>is indivisible, so that that which causes substances to be one must be 
<A NAME="34"></A>one in the primary sense. 'One', then, has all these meanings-the naturally 
<A NAME="35"></A>continuous and the whole, and the individual and the universal. And all 
<A NAME="36"></A>these are one because in some cases the movement, in others the thought 
<A NAME="37"></A>or the definition is indivisible. <BR><BR>"But it must be observed that 
<A NAME="38"></A>the questions, what sort of things are said to be one, and what it is to 
<A NAME="39"></A>be one and what is the definition of it, should not be assumed to be the 
<A NAME="40"></A>same. 'One' has all these meanings, and each of the things to which one 
<A NAME="41"></A>of these kinds of unity belongs will be one; but 'to be one' will sometimes 
<A NAME="42"></A>mean being one of these things, and sometimes being something else which 
<A NAME="43"></A>is even nearer to the meaning of the word 'one' while these other things 
<A NAME="44"></A>approximate to its application. This is also true of 'element' or 'cause', 
<A NAME="45"></A>if one had both to specify the things of which it is predicable and to 
<A NAME="46"></A>render the definition of the word. For in a sense fire is an element (and 
<A NAME="47"></A>doubtless also 'the indefinite' or something else of the sort is by its 
<A NAME="48"></A>own nature the element), but in a sense it is not; for it is not the same 
<A NAME="49"></A>thing to be fire and to be an element, but while as a particular thing 
<A NAME="50"></A>with a nature of its own fire is an element, the name 'element' means that 
<A NAME="51"></A>it has this attribute, that there is something which is made of it as a 
<A NAME="52"></A>primary constituent. And so with 'cause' and 'one' and all such terms. 
<A NAME="53"></A>For this reason, too, 'to be one' means 'to be indivisible, being essentially 
<A NAME="54"></A>one means a "this" and capable of being isolated either in place, or in 
<A NAME="55"></A>form or thought'; or perhaps 'to be whole and indivisible'; but it means 
<A NAME="56"></A>especially 'to be the first measure of a kind', and most strictly of quantity; 
<A NAME="57"></A>for it is from this that it has been extended to the other categories. 
<A NAME="58"></A>For measure is that by which quantity is known; and quantity qua quantity 
<A NAME="59"></A>is known either by a 'one' or by a number, and all number is known by a 
<A NAME="60"></A>'one'. Therefore all quantity qua quantity is known by the one, and that 
<A NAME="61"></A>by which quantities are primarily known is the one itself; and so the one 
<A NAME="62"></A>is the starting-point of number qua number. And hence in the other classes 
<A NAME="63"></A>too 'measure' means that by which each is first known, and the measure 
<A NAME="64"></A>of each is a unit-in length, in breadth, in depth, in weight, in speed. 
<A NAME="65"></A>(The words 'weight' and 'speed' are common to both contraries; for each 
<A NAME="66"></A>of them has two meanings-'weight' means both that which has any amount 
<A NAME="67"></A>of gravity and that which has an excess of gravity, and 'speed' both that 
<A NAME="68"></A>which has any amount of movement and that which has an excess of movement; 
<A NAME="69"></A>for even the slow has a certain speed and the comparatively light a certain 
<A NAME="70"></A>weight.) <BR><BR>"In all these, then, the measure and starting-point is 
<A NAME="71"></A>something one and indivisible, since even in lines we treat as indivisible 
<A NAME="72"></A>the line a foot long. For everywhere we seek as the measure something one 
<A NAME="73"></A>and indivisible; and this is that which is simple either in quality or 
<A NAME="74"></A>in quantity. Now where it is thought impossible to take away or to add, 
<A NAME="75"></A>there the measure is exact (hence that of number is most exact; for we 
<A NAME="76"></A>posit the unit as indivisible in every respect); but in all other cases 
<A NAME="77"></A>we imitate this sort of measure. For in the case of a furlong or a talent 
<A NAME="78"></A>or of anything comparatively large any addition or subtraction might more 
<A NAME="79"></A>easily escape our notice than in the case of something smaller; so that 
<A NAME="80"></A>the first thing from which, as far as our perception goes, nothing can 
<A NAME="81"></A>be subtracted, all men make the measure, whether of liquids or of solids, 
<A NAME="82"></A>whether of weight or of size; and they think they know the quantity when 
<A NAME="83"></A>they know it by means of this measure. And indeed they know movement too 
<A NAME="84"></A>by the simple movement and the quickest; for this occupies least time. 
<A NAME="85"></A>And so in astronomy a 'one' of this sort is the starting-point and measure 
<A NAME="86"></A>(for they assume the movement of the heavens to be uniform and the quickest, 
<A NAME="87"></A>and judge the others by reference to it), and in music the quarter-tone 
<A NAME="88"></A>(because it is the least interval), and in speech the letter. And all these 
<A NAME="89"></A>are ones in this sense--not that 'one' is something predicable in the same 
<A NAME="90"></A>sense of all of these, but in the sense we have mentioned. <BR><BR>"But 
<A NAME="91"></A>the measure is not always one in number--sometimes there are several; e.g. 
<A NAME="92"></A>the quarter-tones (not to the ear, but as determined by the ratios) are 
<A NAME="93"></A>two, and the articulate sounds by which we measure are more than one, and 
<A NAME="94"></A>the diagonal of the square and its side are measured by two quantities, 
<A NAME="95"></A>and all spatial magnitudes reveal similar varieties of unit. Thus, then, 
<A NAME="96"></A>the one is the measure of all things, because we come to know the elements 
<A NAME="97"></A>in the substance by dividing the things either in respect of quantity or 
<A NAME="98"></A>in respect of kind. And the one is indivisible just because the first of 
<A NAME="99"></A>each class of things is indivisible. But it is not in the same way that 
<A NAME="100"></A>every 'one' is indivisible e.g. a foot and a unit; the latter is indivisible 
<A NAME="101"></A>in every respect, while the former must be placed among things which are 
<A NAME="102"></A>undivided to perception, as has been said already-only to perception, for 
<A NAME="103"></A>doubtless every continuous thing is divisible. <BR><BR>"The measure is 
<A NAME="104"></A>always homogeneous with the thing measured; the measure of spatial magnitudes 
<A NAME="105"></A>is a spatial magnitude, and in particular that of length is a length, that 
<A NAME="106"></A>of breadth a breadth, that of articulate sound an articulate sound, that 
<A NAME="107"></A>of weight a weight, that of units a unit. (For we must state the matter 
<A NAME="108"></A>so, and not say that the measure of numbers is a number; we ought indeed 
<A NAME="109"></A>to say this if we were to use the corresponding form of words, but the 
<A NAME="110"></A>claim does not really correspond-it is as if one claimed that the measure 
<A NAME="111"></A>of units is units and not a unit; number is a plurality of units.) <BR><BR>"Knowledge, 
<A NAME="112"></A>also, and perception, we call the measure of things for the same reason, 
<A NAME="113"></A>because we come to know something by them-while as a matter of fact they 
<A NAME="114"></A>are measured rather than measure other things. But it is with us as if 
<A NAME="115"></A>some one else measured us and we came to know how big we are by seeing 
<A NAME="116"></A>that he applied the cubit-measure to such and such a fraction of us. But 
<A NAME="117"></A>Protagoras says 'man is the measure of all things', as if he had said 'the 
<A NAME="118"></A>man who knows' or 'the man who perceives'; and these because they have 
<A NAME="119"></A>respectively knowledge and perception, which we say are the measures of 
<A NAME="120"></A>objects. Such thinkers are saying nothing, then, while they appear to be 
<A NAME="121"></A>saying something remarkable. <BR><BR>"Evidently, then, unity in the strictest 
<A NAME="122"></A>sense, if we define it according to the meaning of the word, is a measure, 
<A NAME="123"></A>and most properly of quantity, and secondly of quality. And some things 
<A NAME="124"></A>will be one if they are indivisible in quantity, and others if they are 
<A NAME="125"></A>indivisible in quality; and so that which is one is indivisible, either 
<A NAME="126"></A>absolutely or qua one.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="127"></A><B>Part 2</B>
<A NAME="128"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>"With regard to the substance and nature of the one we must ask 
<A NAME="130"></A>in which of two ways it exists. This is the very question that we reviewed 
<A NAME="131"></A>in our discussion of problems, viz. what the one is and how we must conceive 
<A NAME="132"></A>of it, whether we must take the one itself as being a substance (as both 
<A NAME="133"></A>the Pythagoreans say in earlier and Plato in later times), or there is, 
<A NAME="134"></A>rather, an underlying nature and the one should be described more intelligibly 
<A NAME="135"></A>and more in the manner of the physical philosophers, of whom one says the 
<A NAME="136"></A>one is love, another says it is air, and another the indefinite. <BR><BR>"If, 
<A NAME="137"></A>then, no universal can be a substance, as has been said our discussion 
<A NAME="138"></A>of substance and being, and if being itself cannot be a substance in the 
<A NAME="139"></A>sense of a one apart from the many (for it is common to the many), but 
<A NAME="140"></A>is only a predicate, clearly unity also cannot be a substance; for being 
<A NAME="141"></A>and unity are the most universal of all predicates. Therefore, on the one 
<A NAME="142"></A>hand, genera are not certain entities and substances separable from other 
<A NAME="143"></A>things; and on the other hand the one cannot be a genus, for the same reasons 
<A NAME="144"></A>for which being and substance cannot be genera. <BR><BR>"Further, the position 
<A NAME="145"></A>must be similar in all the kinds of unity. Now 'unity' has just as many 
<A NAME="146"></A>meanings as 'being'; so that since in the sphere of qualities the one is 
<A NAME="147"></A>something definite-some particular kind of thing-and similarly in the sphere 
<A NAME="148"></A>of quantities, clearly we must in every category ask what the one is, as 
<A NAME="149"></A>we must ask what the existent is, since it is not enough to say that its 
<A NAME="150"></A>nature is just to be one or existent. But in colours the one is a colour, 
<A NAME="151"></A>e.g. white, and then the other colours are observed to be produced out 
<A NAME="152"></A>of this and black, and black is the privation of white, as darkness of 
<A NAME="153"></A>light. Therefore if all existent things were colours, existent things would 
<A NAME="154"></A>have been a number, indeed, but of what? Clearly of colours; and the 'one' 
<A NAME="155"></A>would have been a particular 'one', i.e. white. And similarly if all existing 
<A NAME="156"></A>things were tunes, they would have been a number, but a number of quarter-tones, 
<A NAME="157"></A>and their essence would not have been number; and the one would have been 
<A NAME="158"></A>something whose substance was not to be one but to be the quarter-tone. 
<A NAME="159"></A>And similarly if all existent things had been articulate sounds, they would 
<A NAME="160"></A>have been a number of letters, and the one would have been a vowel. And 
<A NAME="161"></A>if all existent things were rectilinear figures, they would have been a 
<A NAME="162"></A>number of figures, and the one would have been the triangle. And the same 
<A NAME="163"></A>argument applies to all other classes. Since, therefore, while there are 
<A NAME="164"></A>numbers and a one both in affections and in qualities and in quantities 
<A NAME="165"></A>and in movement, in all cases the number is a number of particular things 
<A NAME="166"></A>and the one is one something, and its substance is not just to be one, 
<A NAME="167"></A>the same must be true of substances also; for it is true of all cases alike. 
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>"That the one, then, in every class is a definite thing, and in 
<A NAME="169"></A>no case is its nature just this, unity, is evident; but as in colours the 
<A NAME="170"></A>one-itself which we must seek is one colour, so too in substance the one-itself 
<A NAME="171"></A>is one substance. That in a sense unity means the same as being is clear 
<A NAME="172"></A>from the facts that its meanings correspond to the categories one to one, 
<A NAME="173"></A>and it is not comprised within any category (e.g. it is comprised neither 
<A NAME="174"></A>in 'what a thing is' nor in quality, but is related to them just as being 
<A NAME="175"></A>is); that in 'one man' nothing more is predicated than in 'man' (just as 
<A NAME="176"></A>being is nothing apart from substance or quality or quantity); and that 
<A NAME="177"></A>to be one is just to be a particular thing.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="178"></A><B>Part 3</B>
<A NAME="179"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>"The one and the many are opposed in several ways, of which one 
<A NAME="181"></A>is the opposition of the one and plurality as indivisible and divisible; 
<A NAME="182"></A>for that which is either divided or divisible is called a plurality, and 
<A NAME="183"></A>that which is indivisible or not divided is called one. Now since opposition 
<A NAME="184"></A>is of four kinds, and one of these two terms is privative in meaning, they 
<A NAME="185"></A>must be contraries, and neither contradictory nor correlative in meaning. 
<A NAME="186"></A>And the one derives its name and its explanation from its contrary, the 
<A NAME="187"></A>indivisible from the divisible, because plurality and the divisible is 
<A NAME="188"></A>more perceptible than the indivisible, so that in definition plurality 
<A NAME="189"></A>is prior to the indivisible, because of the conditions of perception. <BR><BR>"To 
<A NAME="190"></A>the one belong, as we indicated graphically in our distinction of the contraries, 
<A NAME="191"></A>the same and the like and the equal, and to plurality belong the other 
<A NAME="192"></A>and the unlike and the unequal. 'The same' has several meanings; (1) we 
<A NAME="193"></A>sometimes mean 'the same numerically'; again, (2) we call a thing the same 
<A NAME="194"></A>if it is one both in definition and in number, e.g. you are one with yourself 
<A NAME="195"></A>both in form and in matter; and again, (3) if the definition of its primary 
<A NAME="196"></A>essence is one; e.g. equal straight lines are the same, and so are equal 
<A NAME="197"></A>and equal-angled quadrilaterals; there are many such, but in these equality 
<A NAME="198"></A>constitutes unity. <BR><BR>"Things are like if, not being absolutely the 
<A NAME="199"></A>same, nor without difference in respect of their concrete substance, they 
<A NAME="200"></A>are the same in form; e.g. the larger square is like the smaller, and unequal 
<A NAME="201"></A>straight lines are like; they are like, but not absolutely the same. Other 
<A NAME="202"></A>things are like, if, having the same form, and being things in which difference 
<A NAME="203"></A>of degree is possible, they have no difference of degree. Other things, 
<A NAME="204"></A>if they have a quality that is in form one and same-e.g. whiteness-in a 
<A NAME="205"></A>greater or less degree, are called like because their form is one. Other 
<A NAME="206"></A>things are called like if the qualities they have in common are more numerous 
<A NAME="207"></A>than those in which they differ-either the qualities in general or the 
<A NAME="208"></A>prominent qualities; e.g. tin is like silver, qua white, and gold is like 
<A NAME="209"></A>fire, qua yellow and red. <BR><BR>"Evidently, then, 'other' and 'unlike' 
<A NAME="210"></A>also have several meanings. And the other in one sense is the opposite 
<A NAME="211"></A>of the same (so that everything is either the same as or other than everything 
<A NAME="212"></A>else). In another sense things are other unless both their matter and their 
<A NAME="213"></A>definition are one (so that you are other than your neighbour). The other 
<A NAME="214"></A>in the third sense is exemplified in the objects of mathematics. 'Other 
<A NAME="215"></A>or the same' can therefore be predicated of everything with regard to everything 
<A NAME="216"></A>else-but only if the things are one and existent, for 'other' is not the 
<A NAME="217"></A>contradictory of 'the same'; which is why it is not predicated of non-existent 
<A NAME="218"></A>things (while 'not the same' is so predicated). It is predicated of all 
<A NAME="219"></A>existing things; for everything that is existent and one is by its very 
<A NAME="220"></A>nature either one or not one with anything else. <BR><BR>"The other, then, 
<A NAME="221"></A>and the same are thus opposed. But difference is not the same as otherness. 
<A NAME="222"></A>For the other and that which it is other than need not be other in some 
<A NAME="223"></A>definite respect (for everything that is existent is either other or the 
<A NAME="224"></A>same), but that which is different is different from some particular thing 
<A NAME="225"></A>in some particular respect, so that there must be something identical whereby 
<A NAME="226"></A>they differ. And this identical thing is genus or species; for everything 
<A NAME="227"></A>that differs differs either in genus or in species, in genus if the things 
<A NAME="228"></A>have not their matter in common and are not generated out of each other 
<A NAME="229"></A>(i.e. if they belong to different figures of predication), and in species 
<A NAME="230"></A>if they have the same genus ('genus' meaning that identical thing which 
<A NAME="231"></A>is essentially predicated of both the different things). <BR><BR>"Contraries 
<A NAME="232"></A>are different, and contrariety is a kind of difference. That we are right 
<A NAME="233"></A>in this supposition is shown by induction. For all of these too are seen 
<A NAME="234"></A>to be different; they are not merely other, but some are other in genus, 
<A NAME="235"></A>and others are in the same line of predication, and therefore in the same 
<A NAME="236"></A>genus, and the same in genus. We have distinguished elsewhere what sort 
<A NAME="237"></A>of things are the same or other in genus.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="238"></A><B>Part 4</B>
<A NAME="239"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="240"></A><BR><BR>"Since things which differ may differ from one another more or 
<A NAME="241"></A>less, there is also a greatest difference, and this I call contrariety. 
<A NAME="242"></A>That contrariety is the greatest difference is made clear by induction. 
<A NAME="243"></A>For things which differ in genus have no way to one another, but are too 
<A NAME="244"></A>far distant and are not comparable; and for things that differ in species 
<A NAME="245"></A>the extremes from which generation takes place are the contraries, and 
<A NAME="246"></A>the distance between extremes-and therefore that between the contraries-is 
<A NAME="247"></A>the greatest. <BR><BR>"But surely that which is greatest in each class 
<A NAME="248"></A>is complete. For that is greatest which cannot be exceeded, and that is 
<A NAME="249"></A>complete beyond which nothing can be found. For the complete difference 
<A NAME="250"></A>marks the end of a series (just as the other things which are called complete 
<A NAME="251"></A>are so called because they have attained an end), and beyond the end there 
<A NAME="252"></A>is nothing; for in everything it is the extreme and includes all else, 
<A NAME="253"></A>and therefore there is nothing beyond the end, and the complete needs nothing 
<A NAME="254"></A>further. From this, then, it is clear that contrariety is complete difference; 
<A NAME="255"></A>and as contraries are so called in several senses, their modes of completeness 
<A NAME="256"></A>will answer to the various modes of contrariety which attach to the contraries. 
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>"This being so, it is clear that one thing have more than one contrary 
<A NAME="258"></A>(for neither can there be anything more extreme than the extreme, nor can 
<A NAME="259"></A>there be more than two extremes for the one interval), and, to put the 
<A NAME="260"></A>matter generally, this is clear if contrariety is a difference, and if 
<A NAME="261"></A>difference, and therefore also the complete difference, must be between 
<A NAME="262"></A>two things. <BR><BR>"And the other commonly accepted definitions of contraries 
<A NAME="263"></A>are also necessarily true. For not only is (1) the complete difference 
<A NAME="264"></A>the greatest difference (for we can get no difference beyond it of things 
<A NAME="265"></A>differing either in genus or in species; for it has been shown that there 
<A NAME="266"></A>is no 'difference' between anything and the things outside its genus, and 
<A NAME="267"></A>among the things which differ in species the complete difference is the 
<A NAME="268"></A>greatest); but also (2) the things in the same genus which differ most 
<A NAME="269"></A>are contrary (for the complete difference is the greatest difference between 
<A NAME="270"></A>species of the same genus); and (3) the things in the same receptive material 
<A NAME="271"></A>which differ most are contrary (for the matter is the same for contraries); 
<A NAME="272"></A>and (4) of the things which fall under the same faculty the most different 
<A NAME="273"></A>are contrary (for one science deals with one class of things, and in these 
<A NAME="274"></A>the complete difference is the greatest). <BR><BR>"The primary contrariety 
<A NAME="275"></A>is that between positive state and privation-not every privation, however 
<A NAME="276"></A>(for 'privation' has several meanings), but that which is complete. And 
<A NAME="277"></A>the other contraries must be called so with reference to these, some because 
<A NAME="278"></A>they possess these, others because they produce or tend to produce them, 
<A NAME="279"></A>others because they are acquisitions or losses of these or of other contraries. 
<A NAME="280"></A>Now if the kinds of opposition are contradiction and privation and contrariety 
<A NAME="281"></A>and relation, and of these the first is contradiction, and contradiction 
<A NAME="282"></A>admits of no intermediate, while contraries admit of one, clearly contradiction 
<A NAME="283"></A>and contrariety are not the same. But privation is a kind of contradiction; 
<A NAME="284"></A>for what suffers privation, either in general or in some determinate way, 
<A NAME="285"></A>either that which is quite incapable of having some attribute or that which, 
<A NAME="286"></A>being of such a nature as to have it, has it not; here we have already 
<A NAME="287"></A>a variety of meanings, which have been distinguished elsewhere. Privation, 
<A NAME="288"></A>therefore, is a contradiction or incapacity which is determinate or taken 
<A NAME="289"></A>along with the receptive material. This is the reason why, while contradiction 
<A NAME="290"></A>does not admit of an intermediate, privation sometimes does; for everything 
<A NAME="291"></A>is equal or not equal, but not everything is equal or unequal, or if it 
<A NAME="292"></A>is, it is only within the sphere of that which is receptive of equality. 
<A NAME="293"></A>If, then, the comings-to-be which happen to the matter start from the contraries, 
<A NAME="294"></A>and proceed either from the form and the possession of the form or from 
<A NAME="295"></A>a privation of the form or shape, clearly all contrariety must be privation, 
<A NAME="296"></A>but presumably not all privation is contrariety (the reason being that 
<A NAME="297"></A>that has suffered privation may have suffered it in several ways); for 
<A NAME="298"></A>it is only the extremes from which changes proceed that are contraries. 
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>"And this is obvious also by induction. For every contrariety involves, 
<A NAME="300"></A>as one of its terms, a privation, but not all cases are alike; inequality 
<A NAME="301"></A>is the privation of equality and unlikeness of likeness, and on the other 
<A NAME="302"></A>hand vice is the privation of virtue. But the cases differ in a way already 
<A NAME="303"></A>described; in one case we mean simply that the thing has suffered privation, 
<A NAME="304"></A>in another case that it has done so either at a certain time or in a certain 
<A NAME="305"></A>part (e.g. at a certain age or in the dominant part), or throughout. This 
<A NAME="306"></A>is why in some cases there is a mean (there are men who are neither good 
<A NAME="307"></A>nor bad), and in others there is not (a number must be either odd or even). 
<A NAME="308"></A>Further, some contraries have their subject defined, others have not. Therefore 
<A NAME="309"></A>it is evident that one of the contraries is always privative; but it is 
<A NAME="310"></A>enough if this is true of the first-i.e. the generic-contraries, e.g. the 
<A NAME="311"></A>one and the many; for the others can be reduced to these.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="312"></A><B>Part 5</B>
<A NAME="313"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>"Since one thing has one contrary, we might raise the question 
<A NAME="315"></A>how the one is opposed to the many, and the equal to the great and the 
<A NAME="316"></A>small. For if we used the word 'whether' only in an antithesis such as 
<A NAME="317"></A>'whether it is white or black', or 'whether it is white or not white' (we 
<A NAME="318"></A>do not ask 'whether it is a man or white'), unless we are proceeding on 
<A NAME="319"></A>a prior assumption and asking something such as 'whether it was Cleon or 
<A NAME="320"></A>Socrates that came' as this is not a necessary disjunction in any class 
<A NAME="321"></A>of things; yet even this is an extension from the case of opposites; for 
<A NAME="322"></A>opposites alone cannot be present together; and we assume this incompatibility 
<A NAME="323"></A>here too in asking which of the two came; for if they might both have come, 
<A NAME="324"></A>the question would have been absurd; but if they might, even so this falls 
<A NAME="325"></A>just as much into an antithesis, that of the 'one or many', i.e. 'whether 
<A NAME="326"></A>both came or one of the two':-if, then, the question 'whether' is always 
<A NAME="327"></A>concerned with opposites, and we can ask 'whether it is greater or less 
<A NAME="328"></A>or equal', what is the opposition of the equal to the other two? It is 
<A NAME="329"></A>not contrary either to one alone or to both; for why should it be contrary 
<A NAME="330"></A>to the greater rather than to the less? Further, the equal is contrary 
<A NAME="331"></A>to the unequal. Therefore if it is contrary to the greater and the less, 
<A NAME="332"></A>it will be contrary to more things than one. But if the unequal means the 
<A NAME="333"></A>same as both the greater and the less together, the equal will be opposite 
<A NAME="334"></A>to both (and the difficulty supports those who say the unequal is a 'two'), 
<A NAME="335"></A>but it follows that one thing is contrary to two others, which is impossible. 
<A NAME="336"></A>Again, the equal is evidently intermediate between the great and the small, 
<A NAME="337"></A>but no contrariety is either observed to be intermediate, or, from its 
<A NAME="338"></A>definition, can be so; for it would not be complete if it were intermediate 
<A NAME="339"></A>between any two things, but rather it always has something intermediate 
<A NAME="340"></A>between its own terms. <BR><BR>"It remains, then, that it is opposed either 
<A NAME="341"></A>as negation or as privation. It cannot be the negation or privation of 
<A NAME="342"></A>one of the two; for why of the great rather than of the small? It is, then, 
<A NAME="343"></A>the privative negation of both. This is why 'whether' is said with reference 
<A NAME="344"></A>to both, not to one of the two (e.g. 'whether it is greater or equal' or 
<A NAME="345"></A>'whether it is equal or less'); there are always three cases. But it is 
<A NAME="346"></A>not a necessary privation; for not everything which is not greater or less 
<A NAME="347"></A>is equal, but only the things which are of such a nature as to have these 
<A NAME="348"></A>attributes. <BR><BR>"The equal, then, is that which is neither great nor 
<A NAME="349"></A>small but is naturally fitted to be either great or small; and it is opposed 
<A NAME="350"></A>to both as a privative negation (and therefore is also intermediate). And 
<A NAME="351"></A>that which is neither good nor bad is opposed to both, but has no name; 
<A NAME="352"></A>for each of these has several meanings and the recipient subject is not 
<A NAME="353"></A>one; but that which is neither white nor black has more claim to unity. 
<A NAME="354"></A>Yet even this has not one name, though the colours of which this negation 
<A NAME="355"></A>is privatively predicated are in a way limited; for they must be either 
<A NAME="356"></A>grey or yellow or something else of the kind. Therefore it is an incorrect 
<A NAME="357"></A>criticism that is passed by those who think that all such phrases are used 
<A NAME="358"></A>in the same way, so that that which is neither a shoe nor a hand would 
<A NAME="359"></A>be intermediate between a shoe and a hand, since that which is neither 
<A NAME="360"></A>good nor bad is intermediate between the good and the bad-as if there must 
<A NAME="361"></A>be an intermediate in all cases. But this does not necessarily follow. 
<A NAME="362"></A>For the one phrase is a joint denial of opposites between which there is 
<A NAME="363"></A>an intermediate and a certain natural interval; but between the other two 
<A NAME="364"></A>there is no 'difference'; for the things, the denials of which are combined, 
<A NAME="365"></A>belong to different classes, so that the substratum is not 
<A NAME="366"></A>one.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="367"></A><B>Part 6</B>
<A NAME="368"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>"We might raise similar questions about the one and the many. For 
<A NAME="370"></A>if the many are absolutely opposed to the one, certain impossible results 
<A NAME="371"></A>follow. One will then be few, whether few be treated here as singular or 
<A NAME="372"></A>plural; for the many are opposed also to the few. Further, two will be 
<A NAME="373"></A>many, since the double is multiple and 'double' derives its meaning from 
<A NAME="374"></A>'two'; therefore one will be few; for what is that in comparison with which 
<A NAME="375"></A>two are many, except one, which must therefore be few? For there is nothing 
<A NAME="376"></A>fewer. Further, if the much and the little are in plurality what the long 
<A NAME="377"></A>and the short are in length, and whatever is much is also many, and the 
<A NAME="378"></A>many are much (unless, indeed, there is a difference in the case of an 
<A NAME="379"></A>easily-bounded continuum), the little (or few) will be a plurality. Therefore 
<A NAME="380"></A>one is a plurality if it is few; and this it must be, if two are many. 
<A NAME="381"></A>But perhaps, while the 'many' are in a sense said to be also 'much', it 
<A NAME="382"></A>is with a difference; e.g. water is much but not many. But 'many' is applied 
<A NAME="383"></A>to the things that are divisible; in the one sense it means a plurality 
<A NAME="384"></A>which is excessive either absolutely or relatively (while 'few' is similarly 
<A NAME="385"></A>a plurality which is deficient), and in another sense it means number, 
<A NAME="386"></A>in which sense alone it is opposed to the one. For we say 'one or many', 
<A NAME="387"></A>just as if one were to say 'one and ones' or 'white thing and white things', 
<A NAME="388"></A>or to compare the things that have been measured with the measure. It is 
<A NAME="389"></A>in this sense also that multiples are so called. For each number is said 
<A NAME="390"></A>to be many because it consists of ones and because each number is measurable 
<A NAME="391"></A>by one; and it is 'many' as that which is opposed to one, not to the few. 
<A NAME="392"></A>In this sense, then, even two is many-not, however, in the sense of a plurality 
<A NAME="393"></A>which is excessive either relatively or absolutely; it is the first plurality. 
<A NAME="394"></A>But without qualification two is few; for it is first plurality which is 
<A NAME="395"></A>deficient (for this reason Anaxagoras was not right in leaving the subject 
<A NAME="396"></A>with the statement that 'all things were together, boundless both in plurality 
<A NAME="397"></A>and in smallness'-where for 'and in smallness' he should have said 'and 
<A NAME="398"></A>in fewness'; for they could not have been boundless in fewness), since 
<A NAME="399"></A>it is not one, as some say, but two, that make a few. <BR><BR>"The one 
<A NAME="400"></A>is opposed then to the many in numbers as measure to thing measurable; 
<A NAME="401"></A>and these are opposed as are the relatives which are not from their very 
<A NAME="402"></A>nature relatives. We have distinguished elsewhere the two senses in which 
<A NAME="403"></A>relatives are so called:-(1) as contraries; (2) as knowledge to thing known, 
<A NAME="404"></A>a term being called relative because another is relative to it. There is 
<A NAME="405"></A>nothing to prevent one from being fewer than something, e.g. than two; 
<A NAME="406"></A>for if one is fewer, it is not therefore few. Plurality is as it were the 
<A NAME="407"></A>class to which number belongs; for number is plurality measurable by one, 
<A NAME="408"></A>and one and number are in a sense opposed, not as contrary, but as we have 
<A NAME="409"></A>said some relative terms are opposed; for inasmuch as one is measure and 
<A NAME="410"></A>the other measurable, they are opposed. This is why not everything that 
<A NAME="411"></A>is one is a number; i.e. if the thing is indivisible it is not a number. 
<A NAME="412"></A>But though knowledge is similarly spoken of as relative to the knowable, 
<A NAME="413"></A>the relation does not work out similarly; for while knowledge might be 
<A NAME="414"></A>thought to be the measure, and the knowable the thing measured, the fact 
<A NAME="415"></A>that all knowledge is knowable, but not all that is knowable is knowledge, 
<A NAME="416"></A>because in a sense knowledge is measured by the knowable.-Plurality is 
<A NAME="417"></A>contrary neither to the few (the many being contrary to this as excessive 
<A NAME="418"></A>plurality to plurality exceeded), nor to the one in every sense; but in 
<A NAME="419"></A>the one sense these are contrary, as has been said, because the former 
<A NAME="420"></A>is divisible and the latter indivisible, while in another sense they are 
<A NAME="421"></A>relative as knowledge is to knowable, if plurality is number and the one 
<A NAME="422"></A>is a measure.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="423"></A><B>Part 7</B>
<A NAME="424"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="425"></A><BR><BR>"Since contraries admit of an intermediate and in some cases have 
<A NAME="426"></A>it, intermediates must be composed of the contraries. For (1) all intermediates 
<A NAME="427"></A>are in the same genus as the things between which they stand. For we call 
<A NAME="428"></A>those things intermediates, into which that which changes must change first; 
<A NAME="429"></A>e.g. if we were to pass from the highest string to the lowest by the smallest 
<A NAME="430"></A>intervals, we should come sooner to the intermediate notes, and in colours 
<A NAME="431"></A>if we were to pass from white to black, we should come sooner to crimson 
<A NAME="432"></A>and grey than to black; and similarly in all other cases. But to change 
<A NAME="433"></A>from one genus to another genus is not possible except in an incidental 
<A NAME="434"></A>way, as from colour to figure. Intermediates, then, must be in the same 
<A NAME="435"></A>genus both as one another and as the things they stand between. <BR><BR>"But 
<A NAME="436"></A>(2) all intermediates stand between opposites of some kind; for only between 
<A NAME="437"></A>these can change take place in virtue of their own nature (so that an intermediate 
<A NAME="438"></A>is impossible between things which are not opposite; for then there would 
<A NAME="439"></A>be change which was not from one opposite towards the other). Of opposites, 
<A NAME="440"></A>contradictories admit of no middle term; for this is what contradiction 
<A NAME="441"></A>is-an opposition, one or other side of which must attach to anything whatever, 
<A NAME="442"></A>i.e. which has no intermediate. Of other opposites, some are relative, 
<A NAME="443"></A>others privative, others contrary. Of relative terms, those which are not 
<A NAME="444"></A>contrary have no intermediate; the reason is that they are not in the same 
<A NAME="445"></A>genus. For what intermediate could there be between knowledge and knowable? 
<A NAME="446"></A>But between great and small there is one. <BR><BR>"(3) If intermediates 
<A NAME="447"></A>are in the same genus, as has been shown, and stand between contraries, 
<A NAME="448"></A>they must be composed of these contraries. For either there will be a genus 
<A NAME="449"></A>including the contraries or there will be none. And if (a) there is to 
<A NAME="450"></A>be a genus in such a way that it is something prior to the contraries, 
<A NAME="451"></A>the differentiae which constituted the contrary species-of-a-genus will 
<A NAME="452"></A>be contraries prior to the species; for species are composed of the genus 
<A NAME="453"></A>and the differentiae. (E.g. if white and black are contraries, and one 
<A NAME="454"></A>is a piercing colour and the other a compressing colour, these differentiae-'piercing' 
<A NAME="455"></A>and 'compressing'-are prior; so that these are prior contraries of one 
<A NAME="456"></A>another.) But, again, the species which differ contrariwise are the more 
<A NAME="457"></A>truly contrary species. And the other.species, i.e. the intermediates, 
<A NAME="458"></A>must be composed of their genus and their differentiae. (E.g. all colours 
<A NAME="459"></A>which are between white and black must be said to be composed of the genus, 
<A NAME="460"></A>i.e. colour, and certain differentiae. But these differentiae will not 
<A NAME="461"></A>be the primary contraries; otherwise every colour would be either white 
<A NAME="462"></A>or black. They are different, then, from the primary contraries; and therefore 
<A NAME="463"></A>they will be between the primary contraries; the primary differentiae are 
<A NAME="464"></A>'piercing' and 'compressing'.) <BR><BR>"Therefore it is (b) with regard 
<A NAME="465"></A>to these contraries which do not fall within a genus that we must first 
<A NAME="466"></A>ask of what their intermediates are composed. (For things which are in 
<A NAME="467"></A>the same genus must be composed of terms in which the genus is not an element, 
<A NAME="468"></A>or else be themselves incomposite.) Now contraries do not involve one another 
<A NAME="469"></A>in their composition, and are therefore first principles; but the intermediates 
<A NAME="470"></A>are either all incomposite, or none of them. But there is something compounded 
<A NAME="471"></A>out of the contraries, so that there can be a change from a contrary to 
<A NAME="472"></A>it sooner than to the other contrary; for it will have less of the quality 
<A NAME="473"></A>in question than the one contrary and more than the other. This also, then, 
<A NAME="474"></A>will come between the contraries. All the other intermediates also, therefore, 
<A NAME="475"></A>are composite; for that which has more of a quality than one thing and 
<A NAME="476"></A>less than another is compounded somehow out of the things than which it 
<A NAME="477"></A>is said to have more and less respectively of the quality. And since there 
<A NAME="478"></A>are no other things prior to the contraries and homogeneous with the intermediates, 
<A NAME="479"></A>all intermediates must be compounded out of the contraries. Therefore also 
<A NAME="480"></A>all the inferior classes, both the contraries and their intermediates, 
<A NAME="481"></A>will be compounded out of the primary contraries. Clearly, then, intermediates 
<A NAME="482"></A>are (1) all in the same genus and (2) intermediate between contraries, 
<A NAME="483"></A>and (3) all compounded out of the contraries.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="484"></A><B>Part 8</B>
<A NAME="485"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>"That which is other in species is other than something in something, 
<A NAME="487"></A>and this must belong to both; e.g. if it is an animal other in species, 
<A NAME="488"></A>both are animals. The things, then, which are other in species must be 
<A NAME="489"></A>in the same genus. For by genus I mean that one identical thing which is 
<A NAME="490"></A>predicated of both and is differentiated in no merely accidental way, whether 
<A NAME="491"></A>conceived as matter or otherwise. For not only must the common nature attach 
<A NAME="492"></A>to the different things, e.g. not only must both be animals, but this very 
<A NAME="493"></A>animality must also be different for each (e.g. in the one case equinity, 
<A NAME="494"></A>in the other humanity), and so this common nature is specifically different 
<A NAME="495"></A>for each from what it is for the other. One, then, will be in virtue of 
<A NAME="496"></A>its own nature one sort of animal, and the other another, e.g. one a horse 
<A NAME="497"></A>and the other a man. This difference, then, must be an otherness of the 
<A NAME="498"></A>genus. For I give the name of 'difference in the genus' an otherness which 
<A NAME="499"></A>makes the genus itself other. <BR><BR>"This, then, will be a contrariety 
<A NAME="500"></A>(as can be shown also by induction). For all things are divided by opposites, 
<A NAME="501"></A>and it has been proved that contraries are in the same genus. For contrariety 
<A NAME="502"></A>was seen to be complete difference; and all difference in species is a 
<A NAME="503"></A>difference from something in something; so that this is the same for both 
<A NAME="504"></A>and is their genus. (Hence also all contraries which are different in species 
<A NAME="505"></A>and not in genus are in the same line of predication, and other than one 
<A NAME="506"></A>another in the highest degree-for the difference is complete-, and cannot 
<A NAME="507"></A>be present along with one another.) The difference, then, is a contrariety. 
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>"This, then, is what it is to be 'other in species'-to have a contrariety, 
<A NAME="509"></A>being in the same genus and being indivisible (and those things are the 
<A NAME="510"></A>same in species which have no contrariety, being indivisible); we say 'being 
<A NAME="511"></A>indivisible', for in the process of division contrarieties arise in the 
<A NAME="512"></A>intermediate stages before we come to the indivisibles. Evidently, therefore, 
<A NAME="513"></A>with reference to that which is called the genus, none of the species-of-a-genus 
<A NAME="514"></A>is either the same as it or other than it in species (and this is fitting; 
<A NAME="515"></A>for the matter is indicated by negation, and the genus is the matter of 
<A NAME="516"></A>that of which it is called the genus, not in the sense in which we speak 
<A NAME="517"></A>of the genus or family of the Heraclidae, but in that in which the genus 
<A NAME="518"></A>is an element in a thing's nature), nor is it so with reference to things 
<A NAME="519"></A>which are not in the same genus, but it will differ in genus from them, 
<A NAME="520"></A>and in species from things in the same genus. For a thing's difference 
<A NAME="521"></A>from that from which it differs in species must be a contrariety; and this 
<A NAME="522"></A>belongs only to things in the same genus.

<A NAME="523"></A><B>Part 9</B>
<A NAME="524"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="525"></A><BR><BR>"One might raise the question, why woman does not differ from man 
<A NAME="526"></A>in species, when female and male are contrary and their difference is a 
<A NAME="527"></A>contrariety; and why a female and a male animal are not different in species, 
<A NAME="528"></A>though this difference belongs to animal in virtue of its own nature, and 
<A NAME="529"></A>not as paleness or darkness does; both 'female' and 'male' belong to it 
<A NAME="530"></A>qua animal. This question is almost the same as the other, why one contrariety 
<A NAME="531"></A>makes things different in species and another does not, e.g. 'with feet' 
<A NAME="532"></A>and 'with wings' do, but paleness and darkness do not. Perhaps it is because 
<A NAME="533"></A>the former are modifications peculiar to the genus, and the latter are 
<A NAME="534"></A>less so. And since one element is definition and one is matter, contrarieties 
<A NAME="535"></A>which are in the definition make a difference in species, but those which 
<A NAME="536"></A>are in the thing taken as including its matter do not make one. And so 
<A NAME="537"></A>paleness in a man, or darkness, does not make one, nor is there a difference 
<A NAME="538"></A>in species between the pale man and the dark man, not even if each of them 
<A NAME="539"></A>be denoted by one word. For man is here being considered on his material 
<A NAME="540"></A>side, and matter does not create a difference; for it does not make individual 
<A NAME="541"></A>men species of man, though the flesh and the bones of which this man and 
<A NAME="542"></A>that man consist are other. The concrete thing is other, but not other 
<A NAME="543"></A>in species, because in the definition there is no contrariety. This is 
<A NAME="544"></A>the ultimate indivisible kind. Callias is definition + matter, the pale 
<A NAME="545"></A>man, then, is so also, because it is the individual Callias that is pale; 
<A NAME="546"></A>man, then, is pale only incidentally. Neither do a brazen and a wooden 
<A NAME="547"></A>circle, then, differ in species; and if a brazen triangle and a wooden 
<A NAME="548"></A>circle differ in species, it is not because of the matter, but because 
<A NAME="549"></A>there is a contrariety in the definition. But does the matter not make 
<A NAME="550"></A>things other in species, when it is other in a certain way, or is there 
<A NAME="551"></A>a sense in which it does? For why is this horse other than this man in 
<A NAME="552"></A>species, although their matter is included with their definitions? Doubtless 
<A NAME="553"></A>because there is a contrariety in the definition. For while there is a 
<A NAME="554"></A>contrariety also between pale man and dark horse, and it is a contrariety 
<A NAME="555"></A>in species, it does not depend on the paleness of the one and the darkness 
<A NAME="556"></A>of the other, since even if both had been pale, yet they would have been 
<A NAME="557"></A>other in species. But male and female, while they are modifications peculiar 
<A NAME="558"></A>to 'animal', are so not in virtue of its essence but in the matter, ie. 
<A NAME="559"></A>the body. This is why the same seed becomes female or male by being acted 
<A NAME="560"></A>on in a certain way. We have stated, then, what it is to be other in species, 
<A NAME="561"></A>and why some things differ in species and others do 
<A NAME="562"></A>not.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="563"></A><B>Part 10</B>
<A NAME="564"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR>"Since contraries are other in form, and the perishable and the 
<A NAME="566"></A>imperishable are contraries (for privation is a determinate incapacity), 
<A NAME="567"></A>the perishable and the imperishable must be different in kind. <BR><BR>"Now 
<A NAME="568"></A>so far we have spoken of the general terms themselves, so that it might 
<A NAME="569"></A>be thought not to be necessary that every imperishable thing should be 
<A NAME="570"></A>different from every perishable thing in form, just as not every pale thing 
<A NAME="571"></A>is different in form from every dark thing. For the same thing can be both, 
<A NAME="572"></A>and even at the same time if it is a universal (e.g. man can be both pale 
<A NAME="573"></A>and dark), and if it is an individual it can still be both; for the same 
<A NAME="574"></A>man can be, though not at the same time, pale and dark. Yet pale is contrary 
<A NAME="575"></A>to dark. <BR><BR>"But while some contraries belong to certain things by 
<A NAME="576"></A>accident (e.g. both those now mentioned and many others), others cannot, 
<A NAME="577"></A>and among these are 'perishable' and 'imperishable'. For nothing is by 
<A NAME="578"></A>accident perishable. For what is accidental is capable of not being present, 
<A NAME="579"></A>but perishableness is one of the attributes that belong of necessity to 
<A NAME="580"></A>the things to which they belong; or else one and the same thing may be 
<A NAME="581"></A>perishable and imperishable, if perishableness is capable of not belonging 
<A NAME="582"></A>to it. Perishableness then must either be the essence or be present in 
<A NAME="583"></A>the essence of each perishable thing. The same account holds good for imperishableness 
<A NAME="584"></A>also; for both are attributes which are present of necessity. The characteristics, 
<A NAME="585"></A>then, in respect of which and in direct consequence of which one thing 
<A NAME="586"></A>is perishable and another imperishable, are opposite, so that the things 
<A NAME="587"></A>must be different in kind. <BR><BR>"Evidently, then, there cannot be Forms 
<A NAME="588"></A>such as some maintain, for then one man would be perishable and another 
<A NAME="589"></A>imperishable. Yet the Forms are said to be the same in form with the individuals 
<A NAME="590"></A>and not merely to have the same name; but things which differ in kind are 
<A NAME="591"></A>farther apart than those which differ in form.
