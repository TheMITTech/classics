<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 5</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Our conception of the nature of Odours must be analogous to that of Savours; 
<A NAME="12"></A>inasmuch as the Sapid Dry effects in air and water alike, but in a different 
<A NAME="13"></A>province of sense, precisely what the Dry effects in the Moist of water 
<A NAME="14"></A>only. We customarily predicate Translucency of both air and water in common; 
<A NAME="15"></A>but it is not qua translucent that either is a vehicle of odour, but qua 
<A NAME="16"></A>possessed of a power of washing or rinsing [and so imbibing] the Sapid 
<A NAME="17"></A>Dryness.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>For the object of Smell exists not in air only: it also exists 
<A NAME="19"></A>in water. This is proved by the case of fishes and testacea, which are 
<A NAME="20"></A>seen to possess the faculty of smell, although water contains no air (for 
<A NAME="21"></A>whenever air is generated within water it rises to the surface), and these 
<A NAME="22"></A>creatures do not respire. Hence, if one were to assume that air and water 
<A NAME="23"></A>are both moist, it would follow that Odour is the natural substance consisting 
<A NAME="24"></A>of the Sapid Dry diffused in the Moist, and whatever is of this kind would 
<A NAME="25"></A>be an object of Smell.
<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>That the property of odorousness is based upon the Sapid may be 
<A NAME="27"></A>seen by comparing the things which possess with those which do not possess 
<A NAME="28"></A>odour. The elements, viz. Fire, Air, Earth, Water, are inodorous, because 
<A NAME="29"></A>both the dry and the moist among them are without sapidity, unless some 
<A NAME="30"></A>added ingredient produces it. This explains why sea-water possesses odour, 
<A NAME="31"></A>for [unlike 'elemental' water] it contains savour and dryness. Salt, too, 
<A NAME="32"></A>is more odorous than natron, as the oil which exudes from the former proves, 
<A NAME="33"></A>for natron is allied to ['elemental'] earth more nearly than salt. Again, 
<A NAME="34"></A>a stone is inodorous, just because it is tasteless, while, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="35"></A>wood is odorous, because it is sapid. The kinds of wood, too, which contain 
<A NAME="36"></A>more ['elemental'] water are less odorous than others. Moreover, to take 
<A NAME="37"></A>the case of metals, gold is inodorous because it is without taste, but 
<A NAME="38"></A>bronze and iron are odorous; and when the [sapid] moisture has been burnt 
<A NAME="39"></A>out of them, their slag is, in all cases, less odorous the metals [than 
<A NAME="40"></A>the metals themselves]. Silver and tin are more odorous than the one class 
<A NAME="41"></A>of metals, less so than the other, inasmuch as they are water [to a greater 
<A NAME="42"></A>degree than the former, to a less degree than the latter].
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>Some writers look upon Fumid exhalation, which is a compound of 
<A NAME="44"></A>Earth and Air, as the essence of Odour. [Indeed all are inclined to rush 
<A NAME="45"></A>to this theory of Odour.] Heraclitus implied his adherence to it when he 
<A NAME="46"></A>declared that if all existing things were turned into Smoke, the nose would 
<A NAME="47"></A>be the organ to discern them with. All writers incline to refer odour to 
<A NAME="48"></A>this cause [sc. exhalation of some sort], but some regard it as aqueous, 
<A NAME="49"></A>others as fumid, exhalation; while others, again, hold it to be either. 
<A NAME="50"></A>Aqueous exhalation is merely a form of moisture, but fumid exhalation is, 
<A NAME="51"></A>as already remarked, composed of Air and Earth. The former when condensed 
<A NAME="52"></A>turns into water; the latter, in a particular species of earth. Now, it 
<A NAME="53"></A>is unlikely that odour is either of these. For vaporous exhalation consists 
<A NAME="54"></A>of mere water [which, being tasteless, is inodorous]; and fumid exhalation 
<A NAME="55"></A>cannot occur in water at all, though, as has been before stated, aquatic 
<A NAME="56"></A>creatures also have the sense of smell.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>Again, the exhalation theory of odour is analogous to the theory 
<A NAME="58"></A>of emanations. If, therefore, the latter is untenable, so, too, is the 
<A NAME="59"></A>former.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>It is clearly conceivable that the Moist, whether in air (for air, 
<A NAME="61"></A>too, is essentially moist) or in water, should imbibe the influence of, 
<A NAME="62"></A>and have effects wrought in it by, the Sapid Dryness. Moreover, if the 
<A NAME="63"></A>Dry produces in moist media, i.e. water and air, an effect as of something 
<A NAME="64"></A>washed out in them, it is manifest that odours must be something analogous 
<A NAME="65"></A>to savours. Nay, indeed, this analogy is, in some instances, a fact [registered 
<A NAME="66"></A>in language]; for odours as well as savours are spoken of as pungent, sweet, 
<A NAME="67"></A>harsh, astringent rich [='savoury']; and one might regard fetid smells 
<A NAME="68"></A>as analogous to bitter tastes; which explains why the former are offensive 
<A NAME="69"></A>to inhalation as the latter are to deglutition. It is clear, therefore, 
<A NAME="70"></A>that Odour is in both water and air what Savour is in water alone. This 
<A NAME="71"></A>explains why coldness and freezing render Savours dull, and abolish odours 
<A NAME="72"></A>altogether; for cooling and freezing tend to annul the kinetic heat which 
<A NAME="73"></A>helps to fabricate sapidity.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>There are two species of the Odorous. For the statement of certain 
<A NAME="75"></A>writers that the odorous is not divisible into species is false; it is 
<A NAME="76"></A>so divisible. We must here define the sense in which these species are 
<A NAME="77"></A>to be admitted or denied.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>One class of odours, then, is that which runs parallel, as has 
<A NAME="79"></A>been observed, to savours: to odours of this class their pleasantness or 
<A NAME="80"></A>unpleasantness belongs incidentally. For owing to the fact that Savours 
<A NAME="81"></A>are qualities of nutrient matter, the odours connected with these [e.g. 
<A NAME="82"></A>those of a certain food] are agreeable as long as animals have an appetite 
<A NAME="83"></A>for the food, but they are not agreeable to them when sated and no longer 
<A NAME="84"></A>in want of it; nor are they agreeable, either, to those animals that do 
<A NAME="85"></A>not like the food itself which yields the odours. Hence, as we observed, 
<A NAME="86"></A>these odours are pleasant or unpleasant incidentally, and the same reasoning 
<A NAME="87"></A>explains why it is that they are perceptible to all animals in 
<A NAME="88"></A>common.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>The other class of odours consists of those agreeable in their 
<A NAME="90"></A>essential nature, e.g. those of flowers. For these do not in any degree 
<A NAME="91"></A>stimulate animals to food, nor do they contribute in any way to appetite; 
<A NAME="92"></A>their effect upon it, if any, is rather the opposite. For the verse of 
<A NAME="93"></A>Strattis ridiculing Euripides-
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR><B>Use not perfumery to flavour soup,</B> contains a 
<A NAME="95"></A>truth.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>Those who nowadays introduce such flavours into beverages deforce 
<A NAME="97"></A>our sense of pleasure by habituating us to them, until, from two distinct 
<A NAME="98"></A>kinds of sensations combined, pleasure arises as it might from one simple 
<A NAME="99"></A>kind.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>Of this species of odour man alone is sensible; the other, viz. 
<A NAME="101"></A>that correlated with Tastes, is, as has been said before, perceptible also 
<A NAME="102"></A>to the lower animals. And odours of the latter sort, since their pleasureableness 
<A NAME="103"></A>depends upon taste, are divided into as many species as there are different 
<A NAME="104"></A>tastes; but we cannot go on to say this of the former kind of odour, since 
<A NAME="105"></A>its nature is agreeable or disagreeable per se. The reason why the perception 
<A NAME="106"></A>of such odours is peculiar to man is found in the characteristic state 
<A NAME="107"></A>of man's brain. For his brain is naturally cold, and the blood which it 
<A NAME="108"></A>contains in its vessels is thin and pure but easily cooled (whence it happens 
<A NAME="109"></A>that the exhalation arising from food, being cooled by the coldness of 
<A NAME="110"></A>this region, produces unhealthy rheums); therefore it is that odours of 
<A NAME="111"></A>such a species have been generated for human beings, as a safeguard to 
<A NAME="112"></A>health. This is their sole function, and that they perform it is evident. 
<A NAME="113"></A>For food, whether dry or moist, though sweet to taste, is often unwholesome; 
<A NAME="114"></A>whereas the odour arising from what is fragrant, that odour which is pleasant 
<A NAME="115"></A>in its own right, is, so to say, always beneficial to persons in any state 
<A NAME="116"></A>of bodily health whatever.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>For this reason, too, the perception of odour [in general] effected 
<A NAME="118"></A>through respiration, not in all animals, but in man and certain other sanguineous 
<A NAME="119"></A>animals, e.g. quadrupeds, and all that participate freely in the natural 
<A NAME="120"></A>substance air; because when odours, on account of the lightness of the 
<A NAME="121"></A>heat in them, mount to the brain, the health of this region is thereby 
<A NAME="122"></A>promoted. For odour, as a power, is naturally heat-giving. Thus Nature 
<A NAME="123"></A>has employed respiration for two purposes: primarily for the relief thereby 
<A NAME="124"></A>brought to the thorax, secondarily for the inhalation of odour. For while 
<A NAME="125"></A>an animal is inhaling,- odour moves in through its nostrils, as it were 
<A NAME="126"></A>'from a side-entrance.'
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>But the perception of the second class of odours above described 
<A NAME="128"></A>[does not belong to all animal, but] is confined to human beings, because 
<A NAME="129"></A>man's brain is, in proportion to his whole bulk, larger and moister than 
<A NAME="130"></A>the brain of any other animal. This is the reason of the further fact that 
<A NAME="131"></A>man alone, so to speak, among animals perceives and takes pleasure in the 
<A NAME="132"></A>odours of flowers and such things. For the heat and stimulation set up 
<A NAME="133"></A>by these odours are commensurate with the excess of moisture and coldness 
<A NAME="134"></A>in his cerebral region. On all the other animals which have lungs, Nature 
<A NAME="135"></A>has bestowed their due perception of one of the two kinds of odour [i.e. 
<A NAME="136"></A>that connected with nutrition] through the act of respiration, guarding 
<A NAME="137"></A>against the needless creation of two organs of sense; for in the fact that 
<A NAME="138"></A>they respire the other animals have already sufficient provision for their 
<A NAME="139"></A>perception of the one species of odour only, as human beings have for their 
<A NAME="140"></A>perception of both.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>But that creatures which do not respire have the olfactory sense 
<A NAME="142"></A>is evident. For fishes, and all insects as a class, have, thanks to the 
<A NAME="143"></A>species of odour correlated with nutrition, a keen olfactory sense of their 
<A NAME="144"></A>proper food from a distance, even when they are very far away from it; 
<A NAME="145"></A>such is the case with bees, and also with the class of small ants, which 
<A NAME="146"></A>some denominate knipes. Among marine animals, too, the murex and many other 
<A NAME="147"></A>similar animals have an acute perception of their food by its 
<A NAME="148"></A>odour.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>It is not equally certain what the organ is whereby they so perceive. 
<A NAME="150"></A>This question, of the organ whereby they perceive odour, may well cause 
<A NAME="151"></A>a difficulty, if we assume that smelling takes place in animals only while 
<A NAME="152"></A>respiring (for that this is the fact is manifest in all the animals which 
<A NAME="153"></A>do respire), whereas none of those just mentioned respires, and yet they 
<A NAME="154"></A>have the sense of smell- unless, indeed, they have some other sense not 
<A NAME="155"></A>included in the ordinary five. This supposition is, however, impossible. 
<A NAME="156"></A>For any sense which perceives odour is a sense of smell, and this they 
<A NAME="157"></A>do perceive, though probably not in the same way as creatures which respire, 
<A NAME="158"></A>but when the latter are respiring the current of breath removes something 
<A NAME="159"></A>that is laid like a lid upon the organ proper (which explains why they 
<A NAME="160"></A>do not perceive odours when not respiring); while in creatures which do 
<A NAME="161"></A>not respire this is always off: just as some animals have eyelids on their 
<A NAME="162"></A>eyes, and when these are not raised they cannot see, whereas hard-eyed 
<A NAME="163"></A>animals have no lids, and consequently do not need, besides eyes, an agency 
<A NAME="164"></A>to raise the lids, but see straightway [without intermission] from the 
<A NAME="165"></A>actual moment at which it is first possible for them to do so [i.e. from 
<A NAME="166"></A>the moment when an object first comes within their field of 
<A NAME="167"></A>vision].
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>Consistently with what has been said above, not one of the lower 
<A NAME="169"></A>animals shows repugnance to the odour of things which are essentially ill-smelling, 
<A NAME="170"></A>unless one of the latter is positively pernicious. They are destroyed, 
<A NAME="171"></A>however, by these things, just as human beings are; i.e. as human beings 
<A NAME="172"></A>get headaches from, and are often asphyxiated by, the fumes of charcoal, 
<A NAME="173"></A>so the lower animals perish from the strong fumes of brimstone and bituminous 
<A NAME="174"></A>substances; and it is owing to experience of such effects that they shun 
<A NAME="175"></A>these. For the disagreeable odour in itself they care nothing whatever 
<A NAME="176"></A>(though the odours of many plants are essentially disagreeable), unless, 
<A NAME="177"></A>indeed, it has some effect upon the taste of their food.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>The senses making up an odd number, and an odd number having always 
<A NAME="179"></A>a middle unit, the sense of smell occupies in itself as it were a middle 
<A NAME="180"></A>position between the tactual senses, i.e. Touch and Taste, and those which 
<A NAME="181"></A>perceive through a medium, i.e. Sight and Hearing. Hence the object of 
<A NAME="182"></A>smell, too, is an affection of nutrient substances (which fall within the 
<A NAME="183"></A>class of Tangibles), and is also an affection of the audible and the visible; 
<A NAME="184"></A>whence it is that creatures have the sense of smell both in air and water. 
<A NAME="185"></A>Accordingly, the object of smell is something common to both of these provinces, 
<A NAME="186"></A>i.e. it appertains both to the tangible on the one hand, and on the other 
<A NAME="187"></A>to the audible and translucent. Hence the propriety of the figure by which 
<A NAME="188"></A>it has been described by us as an immersion or washing of dryness in the 
<A NAME="189"></A>Moist and Fluid. Such then must be our account of the sense in which one 
<A NAME="190"></A>is or is not entitled to speak of the odorous as having 
<A NAME="191"></A>species.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>The theory held by certain of the Pythagoreans, that some animals 
<A NAME="193"></A>are nourished by odours alone, is unsound. For, in the first place, we 
<A NAME="194"></A>see that food must be composite, since the bodies nourished by it are not 
<A NAME="195"></A>simple. This explains why waste matter is secreted from food, either within 
<A NAME="196"></A>the organisms, or, as in plants, outside them. But since even water by 
<A NAME="197"></A>itself alone, that is, when unmixed, will not suffice for food- for anything 
<A NAME="198"></A>which is to form a consistency must be corporeal-, it is still much less 
<A NAME="199"></A>conceivable that air should be so corporealized [and thus fitted to be 
<A NAME="200"></A>food]. But, besides this, we see that all animals have a receptacle for 
<A NAME="201"></A>food, from which, when it has entered, the body absorbs it. Now, the organ 
<A NAME="202"></A>which perceives odour is in the head, and odour enters with the inhalation 
<A NAME="203"></A>of the breath; so that it goes to the respiratory region. It is plain, 
<A NAME="204"></A>therefore, that odour, qua odour, does not contribute to nutrition; that, 
<A NAME="205"></A>however, it is serviceable to health is equally plain, as well by immediate 
<A NAME="206"></A>perception as from the arguments above employed; so that odour is in relation 
<A NAME="207"></A>to general health what savour is in the province of nutrition and in relation 
<A NAME="208"></A>to the bodies nourished.
<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>This then must conclude our discussion of the several organs of 
<A NAME="210"></A>sense-perception.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="211"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>One might ask: if every body is infinitely divisible, are its sensible 
<A NAME="213"></A>qualities- Colour, Savour, Odour, Sound, Weight, Cold or Heat, [Heaviness 
<A NAME="214"></A>or] Lightness, Hardness or Softness-also infinitely divisible? Or, is this 
<A NAME="215"></A>impossible?
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>[One might well ask this question], because each of them is productive 
<A NAME="217"></A>of sense-perception, since, in fact, all derive their name [of 'sensible 
<A NAME="218"></A>qualities'] from the very circumstance of their being able to stimulate 
<A NAME="219"></A>this. Hence, [if this is so] both our perception of them should likewise 
<A NAME="220"></A>be divisible to infinity, and every part of a body [however small] should 
<A NAME="221"></A>be a perceptible magnitude. For it is impossible, e.g. to see a thing which 
<A NAME="222"></A>is white but not of a certain magnitude.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>Since if it were not so, [if its sensible qualities were not divisible, 
<A NAME="224"></A>pari passu with body], we might conceive a body existing but having no 
<A NAME="225"></A>colour, or weight, or any such quality; accordingly not perceptible at 
<A NAME="226"></A>all. For these qualities are the objects of sense-perception. On this supposition, 
<A NAME="227"></A>every perceptible object should be regarded as composed not of perceptible 
<A NAME="228"></A>[but of imperceptible] parts. Yet it must [be really composed of perceptible 
<A NAME="229"></A>parts], since assuredly it does not consist of mathematical [and therefore 
<A NAME="230"></A>purely abstract and non-sensible] quantities. Again, by what faculty should 
<A NAME="231"></A>we discern and cognize these [hypothetical real things without sensible 
<A NAME="232"></A>qualities]? Is it by Reason? But they are not objects of Reason; nor does 
<A NAME="233"></A>reason apprehend objects in space, except when it acts in conjunction with 
<A NAME="234"></A>sense-perception. At the same time, if this be the case [that there are 
<A NAME="235"></A>magnitudes, physically real, but without sensible quality], it seems to 
<A NAME="236"></A>tell in favour of the atomistic hypothesis; for thus, indeed, [by accepting 
<A NAME="237"></A>this hypothesis], the question [with which this chapter begins] might be 
<A NAME="238"></A>solved [negatively]. But it is impossible [to accept this hypothesis]. 
<A NAME="239"></A>Our views on the subject of atoms are to be found in our treatise on 
<A NAME="240"></A>Movement.
<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>The solution of these questions will bring with it also the answer 
<A NAME="242"></A>to the question why the species of Colour, Taste, Sound, and other sensible 
<A NAME="243"></A>qualities are limited. For in all classes of things lying between extremes 
<A NAME="244"></A>the intermediates must be limited. But contraries are extremes, and every 
<A NAME="245"></A>object of sense-perception involves contrariety: e.g. in Colour, White 
<A NAME="246"></A>x Black; in Savour, Sweet x Bitter, and in all the other sensibles also 
<A NAME="247"></A>the contraries are extremes. Now, that which is continuous is divisible 
<A NAME="248"></A>into an infinite number of unequal parts, but into a finite number of equal 
<A NAME="249"></A>parts, while that which is not per se continuous is divisible into species 
<A NAME="250"></A>which are finite in number. Since then, the several sensible qualities 
<A NAME="251"></A>of things are to be reckoned as species, while continuity always subsists 
<A NAME="252"></A>in these, we must take account of the difference between the Potential 
<A NAME="253"></A>and the Actual. It is owing to this difference that we do not [actually] 
<A NAME="254"></A>see its ten-thousandth part in a grain of millet, although sight has embraced 
<A NAME="255"></A>the whole grain within its scope; and it is owing to this, too, that the 
<A NAME="256"></A>sound contained in a quarter-tone escapes notice, and yet one hears the 
<A NAME="257"></A>whole strain, inasmuch as it is a continuum; but the interval between the 
<A NAME="258"></A>extreme sounds [that bound the quarter-tone] escapes the ear [being only 
<A NAME="259"></A>potentially audible, not actually]. So, in the case of other objects of 
<A NAME="260"></A>sense, extremely small constituents are unnoticed; because they are only 
<A NAME="261"></A>potentially not actually [perceptible e.g.] visible, unless when they have 
<A NAME="262"></A>been parted from the wholes. So the footlength too exists potentially in 
<A NAME="263"></A>the two-foot length, but actually only when it has been separated from 
<A NAME="264"></A>the whole. But objective increments so small as those above might well, 
<A NAME="265"></A>if separated from their totals, [instead of achieving 'actual' exisistence] 
<A NAME="266"></A>be dissolved in their environments, like a drop of sapid moisture poured 
<A NAME="267"></A>out into the sea. But even if this were not so [sc. with the objective 
<A NAME="268"></A>magnitude], still, since the [subjective] of sense-perception is not perceptible 
<A NAME="269"></A>in itself, nor capable of separate existence (since it exists only potentially 
<A NAME="270"></A>in the more distinctly perceivable whole of sense-perception), so neither 
<A NAME="271"></A>will it be possible to perceive [actually] its correlatively small object 
<A NAME="272"></A>[sc. its quantum of pathema or sensible quality] when separated from the 
<A NAME="273"></A>object-total. But yet this [small object] is to be considered as perceptible: 
<A NAME="274"></A>for it is both potentially so already [i.e. even when alone], and destined 
<A NAME="275"></A>to be actually so when it has become part of an aggregate. Thus, therefore, 
<A NAME="276"></A>we have shown that some magnitudes and their sensible qualities escape 
<A NAME="277"></A>notice, and the reason why they do so, as well as the manner in which they 
<A NAME="278"></A>are still perceptible or not perceptible in such cases. Accordingly then 
<A NAME="279"></A>when these [minutely subdivided] sensibles have once again become aggregated 
<A NAME="280"></A>in a whole in such a manner, relatively to one another, as to be perceptible 
<A NAME="281"></A>actually, and not merely because they are in the whole, but even apart 
<A NAME="282"></A>from it, it follows necessarily [from what has been already stated] that 
<A NAME="283"></A>their sensible qualities, whether colours or tastes or sounds, are limited 
<A NAME="284"></A>in number.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>One might ask:- do the objects of sense-perception, or the movements 
<A NAME="286"></A>proceeding from them ([since movements there are,] in whichever of the 
<A NAME="287"></A>two ways [viz. by emanations or by stimulatory kinesis] sense-perception 
<A NAME="288"></A>takes place), when these are actualized for perception, always arrive first 
<A NAME="289"></A>at a spatial middle point [between the sense-organ and its object], as 
<A NAME="290"></A>Odour evidently does, and also Sound? For he who is nearer [to the odorous 
<A NAME="291"></A>object] perceives the Odour sooner [than who is farther away], and the 
<A NAME="292"></A>Sound of a stroke reaches us some time after it has been struck. Is it 
<A NAME="293"></A>thus also with an object seen, and with Light? Empedocles, for example, 
<A NAME="294"></A>says that the Light from the Sun arrives first in the intervening space 
<A NAME="295"></A>before it comes to the eye, or reaches the Earth. This might plausibly 
<A NAME="296"></A>seem to be the case. For whatever is moved [in space], is moved from one 
<A NAME="297"></A>place to another; hence there must be a corresponding interval of time 
<A NAME="298"></A>also in which it is moved from the one place to the other. But any given 
<A NAME="299"></A>time is divisible into parts; so that we should assume a time when the 
<A NAME="300"></A>sun's ray was not as yet seen, but was still travelling in the middle 
<A NAME="301"></A>space.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>Now, even if it be true that the acts of 'hearing' and 'having 
<A NAME="303"></A>heard', and, generally, those of 'perceiving' and 'having perceived', form 
<A NAME="304"></A>co-instantaneous wholes, in other words, that acts of sense-perception 
<A NAME="305"></A>do not involve a process of becoming, but have their being none the less 
<A NAME="306"></A>without involving such a process; yet, just as, [in the case of sound], 
<A NAME="307"></A>though the stroke which causes the Sound has been already struck, the Sound 
<A NAME="308"></A>is not yet at the ear (and that this last is a fact is further proved by 
<A NAME="309"></A>the transformation which the letters [viz. the consonants as heard] undergo 
<A NAME="310"></A>[in the case of words spoken from a distance], implying that the local 
<A NAME="311"></A>movement [involved in Sound] takes place in the space between [us and the 
<A NAME="312"></A>speaker]; for the reason why [persons addressed from a distance] do not 
<A NAME="313"></A>succeed in catching the sense of what is said is evidently that the air 
<A NAME="314"></A>[sound wave] in moving towards them has its form changed) [granting this, 
<A NAME="315"></A>then, the question arises]: is the same also true in the case of Colour 
<A NAME="316"></A>and Light? For certainly it is not true that the beholder sees, and the 
<A NAME="317"></A>object is seen, in virtue of some merely abstract relationship between 
<A NAME="318"></A>them, such as that between equals. For if it were so, there would be no 
<A NAME="319"></A>need [as there is] that either [the beholder or the thing beheld] should 
<A NAME="320"></A>occupy some particular place; since to the equalization of things their 
<A NAME="321"></A>being near to, or far from, one another makes no difference.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>Now this [travelling through successive positions in the medium] 
<A NAME="323"></A>may with good reason take place as regards Sound and Odour, for these, 
<A NAME="324"></A>like [their media] Air and Water, are continuous, but the movement of both 
<A NAME="325"></A>is divided into parts. This too is the ground of the fact that the object 
<A NAME="326"></A>which the person first in order of proximity hears or smells is the same 
<A NAME="327"></A>as that which each subsequent person perceives, while yet it is not the 
<A NAME="328"></A>same.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>Some, indeed, raise a question also on these very points; they 
<A NAME="330"></A>declare it impossible that one person should hear, or see, or smell, the 
<A NAME="331"></A>same object as another, urging the impossibility of several persons in 
<A NAME="332"></A>different places hearing or smelling [the same object], for the one same 
<A NAME="333"></A>thing would [thus] be divided from itself. The answer is that, in perceiving 
<A NAME="334"></A>the object which first set up the motion- e.g. a bell, or frankincense, 
<A NAME="335"></A>or fire- all perceive an object numerically one and the same; while, of 
<A NAME="336"></A>course, in the special object perceived they perceive an object numerically 
<A NAME="337"></A>different for each, though specifically the same for all; and this, accordingly, 
<A NAME="338"></A>explains how it is that many persons together see, or smell, or hear [the 
<A NAME="339"></A>same object]. These things [the odour or sound proper] are not bodies, 
<A NAME="340"></A>but an affection or process of some kind (otherwise this [viz. simultaneous 
<A NAME="341"></A>perception of the one object by many] would not have been, as it is, a 
<A NAME="342"></A>fact of experience) though, on the other hand, they each imply a body [as 
<A NAME="343"></A>their cause].
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>But [though sound and odour may travel,] with regard to Light the 
<A NAME="345"></A>case is different. For Light has its raison d'etre in the being [not becoming] 
<A NAME="346"></A>of something, but it is not a movement. And in general, even in qualitative 
<A NAME="347"></A>change the case is different from what it is in local movement [both being 
<A NAME="348"></A>different species of kinesis]. Local movements, of course, arrive first 
<A NAME="349"></A>at a point midway before reaching their goal (and Sound, it is currently 
<A NAME="350"></A>believed, is a movement of something locally moved), but we cannot go on 
<A NAME="351"></A>to assert this [arrival at a point midway] like manner of things which 
<A NAME="352"></A>undergo qualitative change. For this kind of change may conceivably take 
<A NAME="353"></A>place in a thing all at once, without one half of it being changed before 
<A NAME="354"></A>the other; e.g. it is conceivable that water should be frozen simultaneously 
<A NAME="355"></A>in every part. But still, for all that, if the body which is heated or 
<A NAME="356"></A>frozen is extensive, each part of it successively is affected by the part 
<A NAME="357"></A>contiguous, while the part first changed in quality is so changed by the 
<A NAME="358"></A>cause itself which originates the change, and thus the change throughout 
<A NAME="359"></A>the whole need not take place coinstantaneously and all at once. Tasting 
<A NAME="360"></A>would have been as smelling now is, if we lived in a liquid medium, and 
<A NAME="361"></A>perceived [the sapid object] at a distance, before touching 
<A NAME="362"></A>it.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>Naturally, then, the parts of media between a sensory organ and 
<A NAME="364"></A>its object are not all affected at once- except in the case of Light [illumination] 
<A NAME="365"></A>for the reason above stated, and also in the case of seeing, for the same 
<A NAME="366"></A>reason; for Light is an efficient cause of seeing.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="367"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>Another question respecting sense-perception is as follows: assuming, 
<A NAME="369"></A>as is natural, that of two [simultaneous] sensory stimuli the stronger 
<A NAME="370"></A>always tends to extrude the weaker [from consciousness], is it conceivable 
<A NAME="371"></A>or not that one should be able to discern two objects coinstantaneously 
<A NAME="372"></A>in the same individual time? The above assumption explains why persons 
<A NAME="373"></A>do not perceive what is brought before their eyes, if they are at the time 
<A NAME="374"></A>deep in thought, or in a fright, or listening to some loud noise. This 
<A NAME="375"></A>assumption, then, must be made, and also the following: that it is easier 
<A NAME="376"></A>to discern each object of sense when in its simple form than when an ingredient 
<A NAME="377"></A>in a mixture; easier, for example, to discern wine when neat than when 
<A NAME="378"></A>blended, and so also honey, and [in other provinces] a colour, or to discern 
<A NAME="379"></A>the nete by itself alone, than [when sounded with the hypate] in the octave; 
<A NAME="380"></A>the reason being that component elements tend to efface [the distinctive 
<A NAME="381"></A>characteristics of] one another. Such is the effect [on one another] of 
<A NAME="382"></A>all ingredients of which, when compounded, some one thing is 
<A NAME="383"></A>formed.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>If, then, the greater stimulus tends to expel the less, it necessarily 
<A NAME="385"></A>follows that, when they concur, this greater should itself too be less 
<A NAME="386"></A>distinctly perceptible than if it were alone, since the less by blending 
<A NAME="387"></A>with it has removed some of its individuality, according to our assumption 
<A NAME="388"></A>that simple objects are in all cases more distinctly 
<A NAME="389"></A>perceptible.
<A NAME="390"></A><BR><BR>Now, if the two stimuli are equal but heterogeneous, no perception 
<A NAME="391"></A>of either will ensue; they will alike efface one another's characteristics. 
<A NAME="392"></A>But in such a case the perception of either stimulus in its simple form 
<A NAME="393"></A>is impossible. Hence either there will then be no sense-perception at all, 
<A NAME="394"></A>or there will be a perception compounded of both and differing from either. 
<A NAME="395"></A>The latter is what actually seems to result from ingredients blended together, 
<A NAME="396"></A>whatever may be the compound in which they are so mixed.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>Since, then, from some concurrent [sensory stimuli] a resultant 
<A NAME="398"></A>object is produced, while from others no such resultant is produced, and 
<A NAME="399"></A>of the latter sort are those things which belong to different sense provinces 
<A NAME="400"></A>(for only those things are capable of mixture whose extremes are contraries, 
<A NAME="401"></A>and no one compound can be formed from, e.g. White and Sharp, except indirectly, 
<A NAME="402"></A>i.e. not as a concord is formed of Sharp and Grave); there follows logically 
<A NAME="403"></A>the impossibility of discerning such concurrent stimuli coinstantaneously. 
<A NAME="404"></A>For we must suppose that the stimuli, when equal, tend alike to efface 
<A NAME="405"></A>one another, since no one [form of stimulus] results from them; while, 
<A NAME="406"></A>if they are unequal, the stronger alone is distinctly 
<A NAME="407"></A>perceptible.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>Again, the soul would be more likely to perceive coinstantaneously, 
<A NAME="409"></A>with one and the same sensory act, two things in the same sensory province, 
<A NAME="410"></A>such as the Grave and the Sharp in sound; for the sensory stimulation in 
<A NAME="411"></A>this one province is more likely to be unitemporal than that involving 
<A NAME="412"></A>two different provinces, as Sight and Hearing. But it is impossible to 
<A NAME="413"></A>perceive two objects coinstantaneously in the same sensory act unless they 
<A NAME="414"></A>have been mixed, [when, however, they are no longer two], for their amalgamation 
<A NAME="415"></A>involves their becoming one, and the sensory act related to one object 
<A NAME="416"></A>is itself one, and such act, when one, is, of course, coinstantaneous with 
<A NAME="417"></A>itself. Hence, when things are mixed we of necessity perceive them coinstantaneously: 
<A NAME="418"></A>for we perceive them by a perception actually one. For an object numerically 
<A NAME="419"></A>one means that which is perceived by a perception actually one, whereas 
<A NAME="420"></A>an object specifically one means that which is perceived by a sensory act 
<A NAME="421"></A>potentially one [i.e. by an energeia of the same sensuous faculty]. If 
<A NAME="422"></A>then the actualized perception is one, it will declare its data to be one 
<A NAME="423"></A>object; they must, therefore, have been mixed. Accordingly, when they have 
<A NAME="424"></A>not been mixed, the actualized perceptions which perceive them will be 
<A NAME="425"></A>two; but [if so, their perception must be successive not coinstantaneous, 
<A NAME="426"></A>for] in one and the same faculty the perception actualized at any single 
<A NAME="427"></A>moment is necessarily one, only one stimulation or exertion of a single 
<A NAME="428"></A>faculty being possible at a single instant, and in the case supposed here 
<A NAME="429"></A>the faculty is one. It follows, therefore, that we cannot conceive the 
<A NAME="430"></A>possibility of perceiving two distinct objects coinstantaneously with one 
<A NAME="431"></A>and the same sense.
<A NAME="432"></A><BR><BR>But if it be thus impossible to perceive coinstantaneously two 
<A NAME="433"></A>objects in the same province of sense if they are really two, manifestly 
<A NAME="434"></A>it is still less conceivable that we should perceive coinstantaneously 
<A NAME="435"></A>objects in two different sensory provinces, as White and Sweet. For it 
<A NAME="436"></A>appears that when the Soul predicates numerical unity it does so in virtue 
<A NAME="437"></A>of nothing else than such coinstantaneous perception [of one object, in 
<A NAME="438"></A>one instant, by one energeia]: while it predicates specific unity in virtue 
<A NAME="439"></A>of [the unity of] the discriminating faculty of sense together with [the 
<A NAME="440"></A>unity of] the mode in which this operates. What I mean, for example, is 
<A NAME="441"></A>this; the same sense no doubt discerns White and Black, [which are hence 
<A NAME="442"></A>generically one] though specifically different from one another, and so, 
<A NAME="443"></A>too, a faculty of sense self-identical, but different from the former, 
<A NAME="444"></A>discerns Sweet and Bitter; but while both these faculties differ from one 
<A NAME="445"></A>another [and each from itself] in their modes of discerning either of their 
<A NAME="446"></A>respective contraries, yet in perceiving the co-ordinates in each province 
<A NAME="447"></A>they proceed in manners analogous to one another; for instance, as Taste 
<A NAME="448"></A>perceives Sweet, so Sight perceives White; and as the latter perceives 
<A NAME="449"></A>Black, so the former perceives Bitter.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>Again, if the stimuli of sense derived from Contraries are themselves 
<A NAME="451"></A>Contrary, and if Contraries cannot be conceived as subsisting together 
<A NAME="452"></A>in the same individual subject, and if Contraries, e.g. Sweet and Bitter, 
<A NAME="453"></A>come under one and the same sense-faculty, we must conclude that it is 
<A NAME="454"></A>impossible to discern them coinstantaneously. It is likewise clearly impossible 
<A NAME="455"></A>so to discern such homogeneous sensibles as are not [indeed] Contrary, 
<A NAME="456"></A>[but are yet of different species]. For these are, [in the sphere of colour, 
<A NAME="457"></A>for instance], classed some with White, others with Black, and so it is, 
<A NAME="458"></A>likewise, in the other provinces of sense; for example, of savours, some 
<A NAME="459"></A>are classed with Sweet, and others with Bitter. Nor can one discern the 
<A NAME="460"></A>components in compounds coinstantaneously (for these are ratios of Contraries, 
<A NAME="461"></A>as e.g. the Octave or the Fifth); unless, indeed, on condition of perceiving 
<A NAME="462"></A>them as one. For thus, and not otherwise, the ratios of the extreme sounds 
<A NAME="463"></A>are compounded into one ratio: since we should have together the ratio, 
<A NAME="464"></A>on the one hand, of Many to Few or of Odd to Even, on the other, that of 
<A NAME="465"></A>Few to Many or of Even to Odd [and these, to be perceived together, must 
<A NAME="466"></A>be unified].
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>If, then, the sensibles denominated co-ordinates though in different 
<A NAME="468"></A>provinces of sense (e.g. I call Sweet and White co-ordinates though in 
<A NAME="469"></A>different provinces) stand yet more aloof, and differ more, from one another 
<A NAME="470"></A>than do any sensibles in the same province; while Sweet differs from White 
<A NAME="471"></A>even more than Black does from White, it is still less conceivable that 
<A NAME="472"></A>one should discern them [viz. sensibles in different sensory provinces 
<A NAME="473"></A>whether co-ordinates or not] coinstantaneously than sensibles which are 
<A NAME="474"></A>in the same province. Therefore, if coinstantaneous perception of the latter 
<A NAME="475"></A>be impossible, that of the former is a fortiori impossible.
<A NAME="476"></A><BR><BR>Some of the writers who treat of concords assert that the sounds 
<A NAME="477"></A>combined in these do not reach us simultaneously, but only appear to do 
<A NAME="478"></A>so, their real successiveness being unnoticed whenever the time it involves 
<A NAME="479"></A>is [so small as to be] imperceptible. Is this true or not? One might perhaps, 
<A NAME="480"></A>following this up, go so far as to say that even the current opinion that 
<A NAME="481"></A>one sees and hears coinstantaneously is due merely to the fact that the 
<A NAME="482"></A>intervals of time [between the really successive perceptions of sight and 
<A NAME="483"></A>hearing] escape observation. But this can scarcely be true, nor is it conceivable 
<A NAME="484"></A>that any portion of time should be [absolutely] imperceptible, or that 
<A NAME="485"></A>any should be absolutely unnoticeable; the truth being that it is possible 
<A NAME="486"></A>to perceive every instant of time. [This is so]; because, if it is inconceivable 
<A NAME="487"></A>that a person should, while perceiving himself or aught else in a continuous 
<A NAME="488"></A>time, be at any instant unaware of his own existence; while, obviously, 
<A NAME="489"></A>the assumption, that there is in the time-continuum a time so small as 
<A NAME="490"></A>to be absolutely imperceptible, carries the implication that a person would, 
<A NAME="491"></A>during such time, be unaware of his own existence, as well as of his seeing 
<A NAME="492"></A>and perceiving; [this assumption must be false].
<A NAME="493"></A><BR><BR>Again, if there is any magnitude, whether time or thing, absolutely 
<A NAME="494"></A>imperceptible owing to its smallness, it follows that there would not be 
<A NAME="495"></A>either a thing which one perceives, or a time in which one perceives it, 
<A NAME="496"></A>unless in the sense that in some part of the given time he sees some part 
<A NAME="497"></A>of the given thing. For [let there be a line ab, divided into two parts 
<A NAME="498"></A>at g, and let this line represent a whole object and a corresponding whole 
<A NAME="499"></A>time. Now,] if one sees the whole line, and perceives it during a time 
<A NAME="500"></A>which forms one and the same continuum, only in the sense that he does 
<A NAME="501"></A>so in some portion of this time, let us suppose the part gb, representing 
<A NAME="502"></A>a time in which by supposition he was perceiving nothing, cut off from 
<A NAME="503"></A>the whole. Well, then, he perceives in a certain part [viz. in the remainder] 
<A NAME="504"></A>of the time, or perceives a part [viz. the remainder] of the line, after 
<A NAME="505"></A>the fashion in which one sees the whole earth by seeing some given part 
<A NAME="506"></A>of it, or walks in a year by walking in some given part of the year. But 
<A NAME="507"></A>[by hypothesis] in the part bg he perceives nothing: therefore, in fact, 
<A NAME="508"></A>he is said to perceive the whole object and during the whole time simply 
<A NAME="509"></A>because he perceives [some part of the object] in some part of the time 
<A NAME="510"></A>ab. But the same argument holds also in the case of ag [the remainder, 
<A NAME="511"></A>regarded in its turn as a whole]; for it will be found [on this theory 
<A NAME="512"></A>of vacant times and imperceptible magnitudes] that one always perceives 
<A NAME="513"></A>only in some part of a given whole time, and perceives only some part of 
<A NAME="514"></A>a whole magnitude, and that it is impossible to perceive any [really] whole 
<A NAME="515"></A>[object in a really whole time; a conclusion which is absurd, as it would 
<A NAME="516"></A>logically annihilate the perception of both Objects and 
<A NAME="517"></A>Time].
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>Therefore we must conclude that all magnitudes are perceptible, 
<A NAME="519"></A>but their actual dimensions do not present themselves immediately in their 
<A NAME="520"></A>presentation as objects. One sees the sun, or a four-cubit rod at a distance, 
<A NAME="521"></A>as a magnitude, but their exact dimensions are not given in their visual 
<A NAME="522"></A>presentation: nay, at times an object of sight appears indivisible, but 
<A NAME="523"></A>[vision like other special senses, is fallible respecting 'common sensibles', 
<A NAME="524"></A>e.g. magnitude, and] nothing that one sees is really indivisible. The reason 
<A NAME="525"></A>of this has been previously explained. It is clear then, from the above 
<A NAME="526"></A>arguments, that no portion of time is imperceptible.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>But we must here return to the question proposed above for discussion, 
<A NAME="528"></A>whether it is possible or impossible to perceive several objects coinstantaneously; 
<A NAME="529"></A>by 'coinstantaneously' I mean perceiving the several objects in a time 
<A NAME="530"></A>one and indivisible relatively to one another, i.e. indivisible in a sense 
<A NAME="531"></A>consistent with its being all a continuum.
<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR>First, then, is it conceivable that one should perceive the different 
<A NAME="533"></A>things coinstantaneously, but each with a different part of the Soul? Or 
<A NAME="534"></A>[must we object] that, in the first place, to begin with the objects of 
<A NAME="535"></A>one and the same sense, e.g. Sight, if we assume it [the Soul qua exercising 
<A NAME="536"></A>Sight] to perceive one colour with one part, and another colour with a 
<A NAME="537"></A>different part, it will have a plurality of parts the same in species, 
<A NAME="538"></A>[as they must be,] since the objects which it thus perceives fall within 
<A NAME="539"></A>the same genus?
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>Should any one [to illustrate how the Soul might have in it two 
<A NAME="541"></A>different parts specifically identical, each directed to a set of aistheta 
<A NAME="542"></A>the same in genus with that to which the other is directed] urge that, 
<A NAME="543"></A>as there are two eyes, so there may be in the Soul something analogous, 
<A NAME="544"></A>[the reply is] that of the eyes, doubtless, some one organ is formed, and 
<A NAME="545"></A>hence their actualization in perception is one; but if this is so in the 
<A NAME="546"></A>Soul, then, in so far as what is formed of both [i.e. of any two specifically 
<A NAME="547"></A>identical parts as assumed] is one, the true perceiving subject also will 
<A NAME="548"></A>be one, [and the contradictory of the above hypothesis (of different parts 
<A NAME="549"></A>of Soul remaining engaged in simultaneous perception with one sense) is 
<A NAME="550"></A>what emerges from the analogy]; while if the two parts of Soul remain separate, 
<A NAME="551"></A>the analogy of the eyes will fail, [for of these some one is really 
<A NAME="552"></A>formed].
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore, [on the supposition of the need of different parts 
<A NAME="554"></A>of Soul, co-operating in each sense, to discern different objects coinstantaneously], 
<A NAME="555"></A>the senses will be each at the same time one and many, as if we should 
<A NAME="556"></A>say that they were each a set of diverse sciences; for neither will an 
<A NAME="557"></A>'activity' exist without its proper faculty, nor without activity will 
<A NAME="558"></A>there be sensation.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>But if the Soul does not, in the way suggested [i.e. with different 
<A NAME="560"></A>parts of itself acting simultaneously], perceive in one and the same individual 
<A NAME="561"></A>time sensibles of the same sense, a fortiori it is not thus that it perceives 
<A NAME="562"></A>sensibles of different senses. For it is, as already stated, more conceivable 
<A NAME="563"></A>that it should perceive a plurality of the former together in this way 
<A NAME="564"></A>than a plurality of heterogeneous objects.
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR>If then, as is the fact, the Soul with one part perceives Sweet, 
<A NAME="566"></A>with another, White, either that which results from these is some one part, 
<A NAME="567"></A>or else there is no such one resultant. But there must be such an one, 
<A NAME="568"></A>inasmuch as the general faculty of sense-perception is one. What one object, 
<A NAME="569"></A>then, does that one faculty [when perceiving an object, e.g. as both White 
<A NAME="570"></A>and Sweet] perceive? [None]; for assuredly no one object arises by composition 
<A NAME="571"></A>of these [heterogeneous objects, such as White and Sweet]. We must conclude, 
<A NAME="572"></A>therefore, that there is, as has been stated before, some one faculty in 
<A NAME="573"></A>the soul with which the latter perceives all its percepts, though it perceives 
<A NAME="574"></A>each different genus of sensibles through a different 
<A NAME="575"></A>organ.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>May we not, then, conceive this faculty which perceives White and 
<A NAME="577"></A>Sweet to be one qua indivisible [sc. qua combining its different simultaneous 
<A NAME="578"></A>objects] in its actualization, but different, when it has become divisible 
<A NAME="579"></A>[sc. qua distinguishing its different simultaneous objects] in its 
<A NAME="580"></A>actualization?
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR>Or is what occurs in the case of the perceiving Soul conceivably 
<A NAME="582"></A>analogous to what holds true in that of the things themselves? For the 
<A NAME="583"></A>same numerically one thing is white and sweet, and has many other qualities, 
<A NAME="584"></A>[while its numerical oneness is not thereby prejudiced] if the fact is 
<A NAME="585"></A>not that the qualities are really separable in the object from one another, 
<A NAME="586"></A>but that the being of each quality is different [from that of every other]. 
<A NAME="587"></A>In the same way therefore we must assume also, in the case of the Soul, 
<A NAME="588"></A>that the faculty of perception in general is in itself numerically one 
<A NAME="589"></A>and the same, but different [differentiated] in its being; different, that 
<A NAME="590"></A>is to say, in genus as regards some of its objects, in species as regards 
<A NAME="591"></A>others. Hence too, we may conclude that one can perceive [numerically different 
<A NAME="592"></A>objects] coinstantaneously with a faculty which is numerically one and 
<A NAME="593"></A>the same, but not the same in its relationship [sc. according as the objects 
<A NAME="594"></A>to which it is directed are not the same].
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>That every sensible object is a magnitude, and that nothing which 
<A NAME="596"></A>it is possible to perceive is indivisible, may be thus shown. The distance 
<A NAME="597"></A>whence an object could not be seen is indeterminate, but that whence it 
<A NAME="598"></A>is visible is determinate. We may say the same of the objects of Smelling 
<A NAME="599"></A>and Hearing, and of all sensibles not discerned by actual contact. Now, 
<A NAME="600"></A>there is, in the interval of distance, some extreme place, the last from 
<A NAME="601"></A>which the object is invisible, and the first from which it is visible. 
<A NAME="602"></A>This place, beyond which if the object be one cannot perceive it, while 
<A NAME="603"></A>if the object be on the hither side one must perceive it, is, I presume, 
<A NAME="604"></A>itself necessarily indivisible. Therefore, if any sensible object be indivisible, 
<A NAME="605"></A>such object, if set in the said extreme place whence imperceptibility ends 
<A NAME="606"></A>and perceptibility begins, will have to be both visible and invisible their 
<A NAME="607"></A>objects, whether regarded in general or at the same time; but this is 
<A NAME="608"></A>impossible.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR>This concludes our survey of the characteristics of the organs 
<A NAME="610"></A>of Sense-perception and their objects, whether regarded in general or in 
<A NAME="611"></A>relation to each organ. Of the remaining subjects, we must first consider 
<A NAME="612"></A>that of memory and remembering.
