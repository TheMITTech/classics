<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Rhetoric is the counterpart of Dialectic. Both alike are concerned with 
<A NAME="12"></A>such things as come, more or less, within the general ken of all men and 
<A NAME="13"></A>belong to no definite science. Accordingly all men make use, more or less, 
<A NAME="14"></A>of both; for to a certain extent all men attempt to discuss statements 
<A NAME="15"></A>and to maintain them, to defend themselves and to attack others. Ordinary 
<A NAME="16"></A>people do this either at random or through practice and from acquired habit. 
<A NAME="17"></A>Both ways being possible, the subject can plainly be handled systematically, 
<A NAME="18"></A>for it is possible to inquire the reason why some speakers succeed through 
<A NAME="19"></A>practice and others spontaneously; and every one will at once agree that 
<A NAME="20"></A>such an inquiry is the function of an art.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>Now, the framers of the current treatises on rhetoric have constructed 
<A NAME="22"></A>but a small portion of that art. The modes of persuasion are the only true 
<A NAME="23"></A>constituents of the art: everything else is merely accessory. These writers, 
<A NAME="24"></A>however, say nothing about enthymemes, which are the substance of rhetorical 
<A NAME="25"></A>persuasion, but deal mainly with non-essentials. The arousing of prejudice, 
<A NAME="26"></A>pity, anger, and similar emotions has nothing to do with the essential 
<A NAME="27"></A>facts, but is merely a personal appeal to the man who is judging the case. 
<A NAME="28"></A>Consequently if the rules for trials which are now laid down some states-especially 
<A NAME="29"></A>in well-governed states-were applied everywhere, such people would have 
<A NAME="30"></A>nothing to say. All men, no doubt, think that the laws should prescribe 
<A NAME="31"></A>such rules, but some, as in the court of Areopagus, give practical effect 
<A NAME="32"></A>to their thoughts and forbid talk about non-essentials. This is sound law 
<A NAME="33"></A>and custom. It is not right to pervert the judge by moving him to anger 
<A NAME="34"></A>or envy or pity-one might as well warp a carpenter's rule before using 
<A NAME="35"></A>it. Again, a litigant has clearly nothing to do but to show that the alleged 
<A NAME="36"></A>fact is so or is not so, that it has or has not happened. As to whether 
<A NAME="37"></A>a thing is important or unimportant, just or unjust, the judge must surely 
<A NAME="38"></A>refuse to take his instructions from the litigants: he must decide for 
<A NAME="39"></A>himself all such points as the law-giver has not already defined for 
<A NAME="40"></A>him.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>Now, it is of great moment that well-drawn laws should themselves 
<A NAME="42"></A>define all the points they possibly can and leave as few as may be to the 
<A NAME="43"></A>decision of the judges; and this for several reasons. First, to find one 
<A NAME="44"></A>man, or a few men, who are sensible persons and capable of legislating 
<A NAME="45"></A>and administering justice is easier than to find a large number. Next, 
<A NAME="46"></A>laws are made after long consideration, whereas decisions in the courts 
<A NAME="47"></A>are given at short notice, which makes it hard for those who try the case 
<A NAME="48"></A>to satisfy the claims of justice and expediency. The weightiest reason 
<A NAME="49"></A>of all is that the decision of the lawgiver is not particular but prospective 
<A NAME="50"></A>and general, whereas members of the assembly and the jury find it their 
<A NAME="51"></A>duty to decide on definite cases brought before them. They will often have 
<A NAME="52"></A>allowed themselves to be so much influenced by feelings of friendship or 
<A NAME="53"></A>hatred or self-interest that they lose any clear vision of the truth and 
<A NAME="54"></A>have their judgement obscured by considerations of personal pleasure or 
<A NAME="55"></A>pain. In general, then, the judge should, we say, be allowed to decide 
<A NAME="56"></A>as few things as possible. But questions as to whether something has happened 
<A NAME="57"></A>or has not happened, will be or will not be, is or is not, must of necessity 
<A NAME="58"></A>be left to the judge, since the lawgiver cannot foresee them. If this is 
<A NAME="59"></A>so, it is evident that any one who lays down rules about other matters, 
<A NAME="60"></A>such as what must be the contents of the 'introduction' or the 'narration' 
<A NAME="61"></A>or any of the other divisions of a speech, is theorizing about non-essentials 
<A NAME="62"></A>as if they belonged to the art. The only question with which these writers 
<A NAME="63"></A>here deal is how to put the judge into a given frame of mind. About the 
<A NAME="64"></A>orator's proper modes of persuasion they have nothing to tell us; nothing, 
<A NAME="65"></A>that is, about how to gain skill in enthymemes.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>Hence it comes that, although the same systematic principles apply 
<A NAME="67"></A>to political as to forensic oratory, and although the former is a nobler 
<A NAME="68"></A>business, and fitter for a citizen, than that which concerns the relations 
<A NAME="69"></A>of private individuals, these authors say nothing about political oratory, 
<A NAME="70"></A>but try, one and all, to write treatises on the way to plead in court. 
<A NAME="71"></A>The reason for this is that in political oratory there is less inducement 
<A NAME="72"></A>to talk about nonessentials. Political oratory is less given to unscrupulous 
<A NAME="73"></A>practices than forensic, because it treats of wider issues. In a political 
<A NAME="74"></A>debate the man who is forming a judgement is making a decision about his 
<A NAME="75"></A>own vital interests. There is no need, therefore, to prove anything except 
<A NAME="76"></A>that the facts are what the supporter of a measure maintains they are. 
<A NAME="77"></A>In forensic oratory this is not enough; to conciliate the listener is what 
<A NAME="78"></A>pays here. It is other people's affairs that are to be decided, so that 
<A NAME="79"></A>the judges, intent on their own satisfaction and listening with partiality, 
<A NAME="80"></A>surrender themselves to the disputants instead of judging between them. 
<A NAME="81"></A>Hence in many places, as we have said already, irrelevant speaking is forbidden 
<A NAME="82"></A>in the law-courts: in the public assembly those who have to form a judgement 
<A NAME="83"></A>are themselves well able to guard against that.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>It is clear, then, that rhetorical study, in its strict sense, 
<A NAME="85"></A>is concerned with the modes of persuasion. Persuasion is clearly a sort 
<A NAME="86"></A>of demonstration, since we are most fully persuaded when we consider a 
<A NAME="87"></A>thing to have been demonstrated. The orator's demonstration is an enthymeme, 
<A NAME="88"></A>and this is, in general, the most effective of the modes of persuasion. 
<A NAME="89"></A>The enthymeme is a sort of syllogism, and the consideration of syllogisms 
<A NAME="90"></A>of all kinds, without distinction, is the business of dialectic, either 
<A NAME="91"></A>of dialectic as a whole or of one of its branches. It follows plainly, 
<A NAME="92"></A>therefore, that he who is best able to see how and from what elements a 
<A NAME="93"></A>syllogism is produced will also be best skilled in the enthymeme, when 
<A NAME="94"></A>he has further learnt what its subject-matter is and in what respects it 
<A NAME="95"></A>differs from the syllogism of strict logic. The true and the approximately 
<A NAME="96"></A>true are apprehended by the same faculty; it may also be noted that men 
<A NAME="97"></A>have a sufficient natural instinct for what is true, and usually do arrive 
<A NAME="98"></A>at the truth. Hence the man who makes a good guess at truth is likely to 
<A NAME="99"></A>make a good guess at probabilities.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>It has now been shown that the ordinary writers on rhetoric treat 
<A NAME="101"></A>of non-essentials; it has also been shown why they have inclined more towards 
<A NAME="102"></A>the forensic branch of oratory.
<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>Rhetoric is useful (1) because things that are true and things 
<A NAME="104"></A>that are just have a natural tendency to prevail over their opposites, 
<A NAME="105"></A>so that if the decisions of judges are not what they ought to be, the defeat 
<A NAME="106"></A>must be due to the speakers themselves, and they must be blamed accordingly. 
<A NAME="107"></A>Moreover, (2) before some audiences not even the possession of the exactest 
<A NAME="108"></A>knowledge will make it easy for what we say to produce conviction. For 
<A NAME="109"></A>argument based on knowledge implies instruction, and there are people whom 
<A NAME="110"></A>one cannot instruct. Here, then, we must use, as our modes of persuasion 
<A NAME="111"></A>and argument, notions possessed by everybody, as we observed in the Topics 
<A NAME="112"></A>when dealing with the way to handle a popular audience. Further, (3) we 
<A NAME="113"></A>must be able to employ persuasion, just as strict reasoning can be employed, 
<A NAME="114"></A>on opposite sides of a question, not in order that we may in practice employ 
<A NAME="115"></A>it in both ways (for we must not make people believe what is wrong), but 
<A NAME="116"></A>in order that we may see clearly what the facts are, and that, if another 
<A NAME="117"></A>man argues unfairly, we on our part may be able to confute him. No other 
<A NAME="118"></A>of the arts draws opposite conclusions: dialectic and rhetoric alone do 
<A NAME="119"></A>this. Both these arts draw opposite conclusions impartially. Nevertheless, 
<A NAME="120"></A>the underlying facts do not lend themselves equally well to the contrary 
<A NAME="121"></A>views. No; things that are true and things that are better are, by their 
<A NAME="122"></A>nature, practically always easier to prove and easier to believe in. Again, 
<A NAME="123"></A>(4) it is absurd to hold that a man ought to be ashamed of being unable 
<A NAME="124"></A>to defend himself with his limbs, but not of being unable to defend himself 
<A NAME="125"></A>with speech and reason, when the use of rational speech is more distinctive 
<A NAME="126"></A>of a human being than the use of his limbs. And if it be objected that 
<A NAME="127"></A>one who uses such power of speech unjustly might do great harm, that is 
<A NAME="128"></A>a charge which may be made in common against all good things except virtue, 
<A NAME="129"></A>and above all against the things that are most useful, as strength, health, 
<A NAME="130"></A>wealth, generalship. A man can confer the greatest of benefits by a right 
<A NAME="131"></A>use of these, and inflict the greatest of injuries by using them 
<A NAME="132"></A>wrongly.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>It is clear, then, that rhetoric is not bound up with a single 
<A NAME="134"></A>definite class of subjects, but is as universal as dialectic; it is clear, 
<A NAME="135"></A>also, that it is useful. It is clear, further, that its function is not 
<A NAME="136"></A>simply to succeed in persuading, but rather to discover the means of coming 
<A NAME="137"></A>as near such success as the circumstances of each particular case allow. 
<A NAME="138"></A>In this it resembles all other arts. For example, it is not the function 
<A NAME="139"></A>of medicine simply to make a man quite healthy, but to put him as far as 
<A NAME="140"></A>may be on the road to health; it is possible to give excellent treatment 
<A NAME="141"></A>even to those who can never enjoy sound health. Furthermore, it is plain 
<A NAME="142"></A>that it is the function of one and the same art to discern the real and 
<A NAME="143"></A>the apparent means of persuasion, just as it is the function of dialectic 
<A NAME="144"></A>to discern the real and the apparent syllogism. What makes a man a 'sophist' 
<A NAME="145"></A>is not his faculty, but his moral purpose. In rhetoric, however, the term 
<A NAME="146"></A>'rhetorician' may describe either the speaker's knowledge of the art, or 
<A NAME="147"></A>his moral purpose. In dialectic it is different: a man is a 'sophist' because 
<A NAME="148"></A>he has a certain kind of moral purpose, a 'dialectician' in respect, not 
<A NAME="149"></A>of his moral purpose, but of his faculty.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>Let us now try to give some account of the systematic principles 
<A NAME="151"></A>of Rhetoric itself-of the right method and means of succeeding in the object 
<A NAME="152"></A>we set before us. We must make as it were a fresh start, and before going 
<A NAME="153"></A>further define what rhetoric is.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="154"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>Rhetoric may be defined as the faculty of observing in any given 
<A NAME="156"></A>case the available means of persuasion. This is not a function of any other 
<A NAME="157"></A>art. Every other art can instruct or persuade about its own particular 
<A NAME="158"></A>subject-matter; for instance, medicine about what is healthy and unhealthy, 
<A NAME="159"></A>geometry about the properties of magnitudes, arithmetic about numbers, 
<A NAME="160"></A>and the same is true of the other arts and sciences. But rhetoric we look 
<A NAME="161"></A>upon as the power of observing the means of persuasion on almost any subject 
<A NAME="162"></A>presented to us; and that is why we say that, in its technical character, 
<A NAME="163"></A>it is not concerned with any special or definite class of 
<A NAME="164"></A>subjects.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>Of the modes of persuasion some belong strictly to the art of rhetoric 
<A NAME="166"></A>and some do not. By the latter I mean such things as are not supplied by 
<A NAME="167"></A>the speaker but are there at the outset-witnesses, evidence given under 
<A NAME="168"></A>torture, written contracts, and so on. By the former I mean such as we 
<A NAME="169"></A>can ourselves construct by means of the principles of rhetoric. The one 
<A NAME="170"></A>kind has merely to be used, the other has to be invented.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>Of the modes of persuasion furnished by the spoken word there are 
<A NAME="172"></A>three kinds. The first kind depends on the personal character of the speaker; 
<A NAME="173"></A>the second on putting the audience into a certain frame of mind; the third 
<A NAME="174"></A>on the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speech itself. 
<A NAME="175"></A>Persuasion is achieved by the speaker's personal character when the speech 
<A NAME="176"></A>is so spoken as to make us think him credible. We believe good men more 
<A NAME="177"></A>fully and more readily than others: this is true generally whatever the 
<A NAME="178"></A>question is, and absolutely true where exact certainty is impossible and 
<A NAME="179"></A>opinions are divided. This kind of persuasion, like the others, should 
<A NAME="180"></A>be achieved by what the speaker says, not by what people think of his character 
<A NAME="181"></A>before he begins to speak. It is not true, as some writers assume in their 
<A NAME="182"></A>treatises on rhetoric, that the personal goodness revealed by the speaker 
<A NAME="183"></A>contributes nothing to his power of persuasion; on the contrary, his character 
<A NAME="184"></A>may almost be called the most effective means of persuasion he possesses. 
<A NAME="185"></A>Secondly, persuasion may come through the hearers, when the speech stirs 
<A NAME="186"></A>their emotions. Our judgements when we are pleased and friendly are not 
<A NAME="187"></A>the same as when we are pained and hostile. It is towards producing these 
<A NAME="188"></A>effects, as we maintain, that present-day writers on rhetoric direct the 
<A NAME="189"></A>whole of their efforts. This subject shall be treated in detail when we 
<A NAME="190"></A>come to speak of the emotions. Thirdly, persuasion is effected through 
<A NAME="191"></A>the speech itself when we have proved a truth or an apparent truth by means 
<A NAME="192"></A>of the persuasive arguments suitable to the case in 
<A NAME="193"></A>question.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>There are, then, these three means of effecting persuasion. The 
<A NAME="195"></A>man who is to be in command of them must, it is clear, be able (1) to reason 
<A NAME="196"></A>logically, (2) to understand human character and goodness in their various 
<A NAME="197"></A>forms, and (3) to understand the emotions-that is, to name them and describe 
<A NAME="198"></A>them, to know their causes and the way in which they are excited. It thus 
<A NAME="199"></A>appears that rhetoric is an offshoot of dialectic and also of ethical studies. 
<A NAME="200"></A>Ethical studies may fairly be called political; and for this reason rhetoric 
<A NAME="201"></A>masquerades as political science, and the professors of it as political 
<A NAME="202"></A>experts-sometimes from want of education, sometimes from ostentation, sometimes 
<A NAME="203"></A>owing to other human failings. As a matter of fact, it is a branch of dialectic 
<A NAME="204"></A>and similar to it, as we said at the outset. Neither rhetoric nor dialectic 
<A NAME="205"></A>is the scientific study of any one separate subject: both are faculties 
<A NAME="206"></A>for providing arguments. This is perhaps a sufficient account of their 
<A NAME="207"></A>scope and of how they are related to each other.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>With regard to the persuasion achieved by proof or apparent proof: 
<A NAME="209"></A>just as in dialectic there is induction on the one hand and syllogism or 
<A NAME="210"></A>apparent syllogism on the other, so it is in rhetoric. The example is an 
<A NAME="211"></A>induction, the enthymeme is a syllogism, and the apparent enthymeme is 
<A NAME="212"></A>an apparent syllogism. I call the enthymeme a rhetorical syllogism, and 
<A NAME="213"></A>the example a rhetorical induction. Every one who effects persuasion through 
<A NAME="214"></A>proof does in fact use either enthymemes or examples: there is no other 
<A NAME="215"></A>way. And since every one who proves anything at all is bound to use either 
<A NAME="216"></A>syllogisms or inductions (and this is clear to us from the Analytics), 
<A NAME="217"></A>it must follow that enthymemes are syllogisms and examples are inductions. 
<A NAME="218"></A>The difference between example and enthymeme is made plain by the passages 
<A NAME="219"></A>in the Topics where induction and syllogism have already been discussed. 
<A NAME="220"></A>When we base the proof of a proposition on a number of similar cases, this 
<A NAME="221"></A>is induction in dialectic, example in rhetoric; when it is shown that, 
<A NAME="222"></A>certain propositions being true, a further and quite distinct proposition 
<A NAME="223"></A>must also be true in consequence, whether invariably or usually, this is 
<A NAME="224"></A>called syllogism in dialectic, enthymeme in rhetoric. It is plain also 
<A NAME="225"></A>that each of these types of oratory has its advantages. Types of oratory, 
<A NAME="226"></A>I say: for what has been said in the Methodics applies equally well here; 
<A NAME="227"></A>in some oratorical styles examples prevail, in others enthymemes; and in 
<A NAME="228"></A>like manner, some orators are better at the former and some at the latter. 
<A NAME="229"></A>Speeches that rely on examples are as persuasive as the other kind, but 
<A NAME="230"></A>those which rely on enthymemes excite the louder applause. The sources 
<A NAME="231"></A>of examples and enthymemes, and their proper uses, we will discuss later. 
<A NAME="232"></A>Our next step is to define the processes themselves more 
<A NAME="233"></A>clearly.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>A statement is persuasive and credible either because it is directly 
<A NAME="235"></A>self-evident or because it appears to be proved from other statements that 
<A NAME="236"></A>are so. In either case it is persuasive because there is somebody whom 
<A NAME="237"></A>it persuades. But none of the arts theorize about individual cases. Medicine, 
<A NAME="238"></A>for instance, does not theorize about what will help to cure Socrates or 
<A NAME="239"></A>Callias, but only about what will help to cure any or all of a given class 
<A NAME="240"></A>of patients: this alone is business: individual cases are so infinitely 
<A NAME="241"></A>various that no systematic knowledge of them is possible. In the same way 
<A NAME="242"></A>the theory of rhetoric is concerned not with what seems probable to a given 
<A NAME="243"></A>individual like Socrates or Hippias, but with what seems probable to men 
<A NAME="244"></A>of a given type; and this is true of dialectic also. Dialectic does not 
<A NAME="245"></A>construct its syllogisms out of any haphazard materials, such as the fancies 
<A NAME="246"></A>of crazy people, but out of materials that call for discussion; and rhetoric, 
<A NAME="247"></A>too, draws upon the regular subjects of debate. The duty of rhetoric is 
<A NAME="248"></A>to deal with such matters as we deliberate upon without arts or systems 
<A NAME="249"></A>to guide us, in the hearing of persons who cannot take in at a glance a 
<A NAME="250"></A>complicated argument, or follow a long chain of reasoning. The subjects 
<A NAME="251"></A>of our deliberation are such as seem to present us with alternative possibilities: 
<A NAME="252"></A>about things that could not have been, and cannot now or in the future 
<A NAME="253"></A>be, other than they are, nobody who takes them to be of this nature wastes 
<A NAME="254"></A>his time in deliberation.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>It is possible to form syllogisms and draw conclusions from the 
<A NAME="256"></A>results of previous syllogisms; or, on the other hand, from premisses which 
<A NAME="257"></A>have not been thus proved, and at the same time are so little accepted 
<A NAME="258"></A>that they call for proof. Reasonings of the former kind will necessarily 
<A NAME="259"></A>be hard to follow owing to their length, for we assume an audience of untrained 
<A NAME="260"></A>thinkers; those of the latter kind will fail to win assent, because they 
<A NAME="261"></A>are based on premisses that are not generally admitted or 
<A NAME="262"></A>believed.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>The enthymeme and the example must, then, deal with what is in 
<A NAME="264"></A>the main contingent, the example being an induction, and the enthymeme 
<A NAME="265"></A>a syllogism, about such matters. The enthymeme must consist of few propositions, 
<A NAME="266"></A>fewer often than those which make up the normal syllogism. For if any of 
<A NAME="267"></A>these propositions is a familiar fact, there is no need even to mention 
<A NAME="268"></A>it; the hearer adds it himself. Thus, to show that Dorieus has been victor 
<A NAME="269"></A>in a contest for which the prize is a crown, it is enough to say 'For he 
<A NAME="270"></A>has been victor in the Olympic games', without adding 'And in the Olympic 
<A NAME="271"></A>games the prize is a crown', a fact which everybody 
<A NAME="272"></A>knows.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>There are few facts of the 'necessary' type that can form the basis 
<A NAME="274"></A>of rhetorical syllogisms. Most of the things about which we make decisions, 
<A NAME="275"></A>and into which therefore we inquire, present us with alternative possibilities. 
<A NAME="276"></A>For it is about our actions that we deliberate and inquire, and all our 
<A NAME="277"></A>actions have a contingent character; hardly any of them are determined 
<A NAME="278"></A>by necessity. Again, conclusions that state what is merely usual or possible 
<A NAME="279"></A>must be drawn from premisses that do the same, just as 'necessary' conclusions 
<A NAME="280"></A>must be drawn from 'necessary' premisses; this too is clear to us from 
<A NAME="281"></A>the Analytics. It is evident, therefore, that the propositions forming 
<A NAME="282"></A>the basis of enthymemes, though some of them may be 'necessary', will most 
<A NAME="283"></A>of them be only usually true. Now the materials of enthymemes are Probabilities 
<A NAME="284"></A>and Signs, which we can see must correspond respectively with the propositions 
<A NAME="285"></A>that are generally and those that are necessarily true. A Probability is 
<A NAME="286"></A>a thing that usually happens; not, however, as some definitions would suggest, 
<A NAME="287"></A>anything whatever that usually happens, but only if it belongs to the class 
<A NAME="288"></A>of the 'contingent' or 'variable'. It bears the same relation to that in 
<A NAME="289"></A>respect of which it is probable as the universal bears to the particular. 
<A NAME="290"></A>Of Signs, one kind bears the same relation to the statement it supports 
<A NAME="291"></A>as the particular bears to the universal, the other the same as the universal 
<A NAME="292"></A>bears to the particular. The infallible kind is a 'complete proof' (tekmerhiou); 
<A NAME="293"></A>the fallible kind has no specific name. By infallible signs I mean those 
<A NAME="294"></A>on which syllogisms proper may be based: and this shows us why this kind 
<A NAME="295"></A>of Sign is called 'complete proof': when people think that what they have 
<A NAME="296"></A>said cannot be refuted, they then think that they are bringing forward 
<A NAME="297"></A>a 'complete proof', meaning that the matter has now been demonstrated and 
<A NAME="298"></A>completed (peperhasmeuou); for the word 'perhas' has the same meaning (of 
<A NAME="299"></A>'end' or 'boundary') as the word 'tekmarh' in the ancient tongue. Now the 
<A NAME="300"></A>one kind of Sign (that which bears to the proposition it supports the relation 
<A NAME="301"></A>of particular to universal) may be illustrated thus. Suppose it were said, 
<A NAME="302"></A>'The fact that Socrates was wise and just is a sign that the wise are just'. 
<A NAME="303"></A>Here we certainly have a Sign; but even though the proposition be true, 
<A NAME="304"></A>the argument is refutable, since it does not form a syllogism. Suppose, 
<A NAME="305"></A>on the other hand, it were said, 'The fact that he has a fever is a sign 
<A NAME="306"></A>that he is ill', or, 'The fact that she is giving milk is a sign that she 
<A NAME="307"></A>has lately borne a child'. Here we have the infallible kind of Sign, the 
<A NAME="308"></A>only kind that constitutes a complete proof, since it is the only kind 
<A NAME="309"></A>that, if the particular statement is true, is irrefutable. The other kind 
<A NAME="310"></A>of Sign, that which bears to the proposition it supports the relation of 
<A NAME="311"></A>universal to particular, might be illustrated by saying, 'The fact that 
<A NAME="312"></A>he breathes fast is a sign that he has a fever'. This argument also is 
<A NAME="313"></A>refutable, even if the statement about the fast breathing be true, since 
<A NAME="314"></A>a man may breathe hard without having a fever.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>It has, then, been stated above what is the nature of a Probability, 
<A NAME="316"></A>of a Sign, and of a complete proof, and what are the differences between 
<A NAME="317"></A>them. In the Analytics a more explicit description has been given of these 
<A NAME="318"></A>points; it is there shown why some of these reasonings can be put into 
<A NAME="319"></A>syllogisms and some cannot.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>The 'example' has already been described as one kind of induction; 
<A NAME="321"></A>and the special nature of the subject-matter that distinguishes it from 
<A NAME="322"></A>the other kinds has also been stated above. Its relation to the proposition 
<A NAME="323"></A>it supports is not that of part to whole, nor whole to part, nor whole 
<A NAME="324"></A>to whole, but of part to part, or like to like. When two statements are 
<A NAME="325"></A>of the same order, but one is more familiar than the other, the former 
<A NAME="326"></A>is an 'example'. The argument may, for instance, be that Dionysius, in 
<A NAME="327"></A>asking as he does for a bodyguard, is scheming to make himself a despot. 
<A NAME="328"></A>For in the past Peisistratus kept asking for a bodyguard in order to carry 
<A NAME="329"></A>out such a scheme, and did make himself a despot as soon as he got it; 
<A NAME="330"></A>and so did Theagenes at Megara; and in the same way all other instances 
<A NAME="331"></A>known to the speaker are made into examples, in order to show what is not 
<A NAME="332"></A>yet known, that Dionysius has the same purpose in making the same request: 
<A NAME="333"></A>all these being instances of the one general principle, that a man who 
<A NAME="334"></A>asks for a bodyguard is scheming to make himself a despot. We have now 
<A NAME="335"></A>described the sources of those means of persuasion which are popularly 
<A NAME="336"></A>supposed to be demonstrative.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>There is an important distinction between two sorts of enthymemes 
<A NAME="338"></A>that has been wholly overlooked by almost everybody-one that also subsists 
<A NAME="339"></A>between the syllogisms treated of in dialectic. One sort of enthymeme really 
<A NAME="340"></A>belongs to rhetoric, as one sort of syllogism really belongs to dialectic; 
<A NAME="341"></A>but the other sort really belongs to other arts and faculties, whether 
<A NAME="342"></A>to those we already exercise or to those we have not yet acquired. Missing 
<A NAME="343"></A>this distinction, people fail to notice that the more correctly they handle 
<A NAME="344"></A>their particular subject the further they are getting away from pure rhetoric 
<A NAME="345"></A>or dialectic. This statement will be clearer if expressed more fully. I 
<A NAME="346"></A>mean that the proper subjects of dialectical and rhetorical syllogisms 
<A NAME="347"></A>are the things with which we say the regular or universal Lines of Argument 
<A NAME="348"></A>are concerned, that is to say those lines of argument that apply equally 
<A NAME="349"></A>to questions of right conduct, natural science, politics, and many other 
<A NAME="350"></A>things that have nothing to do with one another. Take, for instance, the 
<A NAME="351"></A>line of argument concerned with 'the more or less'. On this line of argument 
<A NAME="352"></A>it is equally easy to base a syllogism or enthymeme about any of what nevertheless 
<A NAME="353"></A>are essentially disconnected subjects-right conduct, natural science, or 
<A NAME="354"></A>anything else whatever. But there are also those special Lines of Argument 
<A NAME="355"></A>which are based on such propositions as apply only to particular groups 
<A NAME="356"></A>or classes of things. Thus there are propositions about natural science 
<A NAME="357"></A>on which it is impossible to base any enthymeme or syllogism about ethics, 
<A NAME="358"></A>and other propositions about ethics on which nothing can be based about 
<A NAME="359"></A>natural science. The same principle applies throughout. The general Lines 
<A NAME="360"></A>of Argument have no special subject-matter, and therefore will not increase 
<A NAME="361"></A>our understanding of any particular class of things. On the other hand, 
<A NAME="362"></A>the better the selection one makes of propositions suitable for special 
<A NAME="363"></A>Lines of Argument, the nearer one comes, unconsciously, to setting up a 
<A NAME="364"></A>science that is distinct from dialectic and rhetoric. One may succeed in 
<A NAME="365"></A>stating the required principles, but one's science will be no longer dialectic 
<A NAME="366"></A>or rhetoric, but the science to which the principles thus discovered belong. 
<A NAME="367"></A>Most enthymemes are in fact based upon these particular or special Lines 
<A NAME="368"></A>of Argument; comparatively few on the common or general kind. As in the 
<A NAME="369"></A>therefore, so in this work, we must distinguish, in dealing with enthymemes, 
<A NAME="370"></A>the special and the general Lines of Argument on which they are to be founded. 
<A NAME="371"></A>By special Lines of Argument I mean the propositions peculiar to each several 
<A NAME="372"></A>class of things, by general those common to all classes alike. We may begin 
<A NAME="373"></A>with the special Lines of Argument. But, first of all, let us classify 
<A NAME="374"></A>rhetoric into its varieties. Having distinguished these we may deal with 
<A NAME="375"></A>them one by one, and try to discover the elements of which each is composed, 
<A NAME="376"></A>and the propositions each must employ.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="377"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>Rhetoric falls into three divisions, determined by the three classes 
<A NAME="379"></A>of listeners to speeches. For of the three elements in speech-making--speaker, 
<A NAME="380"></A>subject, and person addressed--it is the last one, the hearer, that determines 
<A NAME="381"></A>the speech's end and object. The hearer must be either a judge, with a 
<A NAME="382"></A>decision to make about things past or future, or an observer. A member 
<A NAME="383"></A>of the assembly decides about future events, a juryman about past events: 
<A NAME="384"></A>while those who merely decide on the orator's skill are observers. From 
<A NAME="385"></A>this it follows that there are three divisions of oratory-(1) political, 
<A NAME="386"></A>(2) forensic, and (3) the ceremonial oratory of display.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>Political speaking urges us either to do or not to do something: 
<A NAME="388"></A>one of these two courses is always taken by private counsellors, as well 
<A NAME="389"></A>as by men who address public assemblies. Forensic speaking either attacks 
<A NAME="390"></A>or defends somebody: one or other of these two things must always be done 
<A NAME="391"></A>by the parties in a case. The ceremonial oratory of display either praises 
<A NAME="392"></A>or censures somebody. These three kinds of rhetoric refer to three different 
<A NAME="393"></A>kinds of time. The political orator is concerned with the future: it is 
<A NAME="394"></A>about things to be done hereafter that he advises, for or against. The 
<A NAME="395"></A>party in a case at law is concerned with the past; one man accuses the 
<A NAME="396"></A>other, and the other defends himself, with reference to things already 
<A NAME="397"></A>done. The ceremonial orator is, properly speaking, concerned with the present, 
<A NAME="398"></A>since all men praise or blame in view of the state of things existing at 
<A NAME="399"></A>the time, though they often find it useful also to recall the past and 
<A NAME="400"></A>to make guesses at the future.
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR>Rhetoric has three distinct ends in view, one for each of its three 
<A NAME="402"></A>kinds. The political orator aims at establishing the expediency or the 
<A NAME="403"></A>harmfulness of a proposed course of action; if he urges its acceptance, 
<A NAME="404"></A>he does so on the ground that it will do good; if he urges its rejection, 
<A NAME="405"></A>he does so on the ground that it will do harm; and all other points, such 
<A NAME="406"></A>as whether the proposal is just or unjust, honourable or dishonourable, 
<A NAME="407"></A>he brings in as subsidiary and relative to this main consideration. Parties 
<A NAME="408"></A>in a law-case aim at establishing the justice or injustice of some action, 
<A NAME="409"></A>and they too bring in all other points as subsidiary and relative to this 
<A NAME="410"></A>one. Those who praise or attack a man aim at proving him worthy of honour 
<A NAME="411"></A>or the reverse, and they too treat all other considerations with reference 
<A NAME="412"></A>to this one.
<A NAME="413"></A><BR><BR>That the three kinds of rhetoric do aim respectively at the three 
<A NAME="414"></A>ends we have mentioned is shown by the fact that speakers will sometimes 
<A NAME="415"></A>not try to establish anything else. Thus, the litigant will sometimes not 
<A NAME="416"></A>deny that a thing has happened or that he has done harm. But that he is 
<A NAME="417"></A>guilty of injustice he will never admit; otherwise there would be no need 
<A NAME="418"></A>of a trial. So too, political orators often make any concession short of 
<A NAME="419"></A>admitting that they are recommending their hearers to take an inexpedient 
<A NAME="420"></A>course or not to take an expedient one. The question whether it is not 
<A NAME="421"></A>unjust for a city to enslave its innocent neighbours often does not trouble 
<A NAME="422"></A>them at all. In like manner those who praise or censure a man do not consider 
<A NAME="423"></A>whether his acts have been expedient or not, but often make it a ground 
<A NAME="424"></A>of actual praise that he has neglected his own interest to do what was 
<A NAME="425"></A>honourable. Thus, they praise Achilles because he championed his fallen 
<A NAME="426"></A>friend Patroclus, though he knew that this meant death, and that otherwise 
<A NAME="427"></A>he need not die: yet while to die thus was the nobler thing for him to 
<A NAME="428"></A>do, the expedient thing was to live on.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>It is evident from what has been said that it is these three subjects, 
<A NAME="430"></A>more than any others, about which the orator must be able to have propositions 
<A NAME="431"></A>at his command. Now the propositions of Rhetoric are Complete Proofs, Probabilities, 
<A NAME="432"></A>and Signs. Every kind of syllogism is composed of propositions, and the 
<A NAME="433"></A>enthymeme is a particular kind of syllogism composed of the aforesaid 
<A NAME="434"></A>propositions.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>Since only possible actions, and not impossible ones, can ever 
<A NAME="436"></A>have been done in the past or the present, and since things which have 
<A NAME="437"></A>not occurred, or will not occur, also cannot have been done or be going 
<A NAME="438"></A>to be done, it is necessary for the political, the forensic, and the ceremonial 
<A NAME="439"></A>speaker alike to be able to have at their command propositions about the 
<A NAME="440"></A>possible and the impossible, and about whether a thing has or has not occurred, 
<A NAME="441"></A>will or will not occur. Further, all men, in giving praise or blame, in 
<A NAME="442"></A>urging us to accept or reject proposals for action, in accusing others 
<A NAME="443"></A>or defending themselves, attempt not only to prove the points mentioned 
<A NAME="444"></A>but also to show that the good or the harm, the honour or disgrace, the 
<A NAME="445"></A>justice or injustice, is great or small, either absolutely or relatively; 
<A NAME="446"></A>and therefore it is plain that we must also have at our command propositions 
<A NAME="447"></A>about greatness or smallness and the greater or the lesser-propositions 
<A NAME="448"></A>both universal and particular. Thus, we must be able to say which is the 
<A NAME="449"></A>greater or lesser good, the greater or lesser act of justice or injustice; 
<A NAME="450"></A>and so on.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>Such, then, are the subjects regarding which we are inevitably 
<A NAME="452"></A>bound to master the propositions relevant to them. We must now discuss 
<A NAME="453"></A>each particular class of these subjects in turn, namely those dealt with 
<A NAME="454"></A>in political, in ceremonial, and lastly in legal, oratory.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="455"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>First, then, we must ascertain what are the kinds of things, good 
<A NAME="457"></A>or bad, about which the political orator offers counsel. For he does not 
<A NAME="458"></A>deal with all things, but only with such as may or may not take place. 
<A NAME="459"></A>Concerning things which exist or will exist inevitably, or which cannot 
<A NAME="460"></A>possibly exist or take place, no counsel can be given. Nor, again, can 
<A NAME="461"></A>counsel be given about the whole class of things which may or may not take 
<A NAME="462"></A>place; for this class includes some good things that occur naturally, and 
<A NAME="463"></A>some that occur by accident; and about these it is useless to offer counsel. 
<A NAME="464"></A>Clearly counsel can only be given on matters about which people deliberate; 
<A NAME="465"></A>matters, namely, that ultimately depend on ourselves, and which we have 
<A NAME="466"></A>it in our power to set going. For we turn a thing over in our mind until 
<A NAME="467"></A>we have reached the point of seeing whether we can do it or 
<A NAME="468"></A>not.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>Now to enumerate and classify accurately the usual subjects of 
<A NAME="470"></A>public business, and further to frame, as far as possible, true definitions 
<A NAME="471"></A>of them is a task which we must not attempt on the present occasion. For 
<A NAME="472"></A>it does not belong to the art of rhetoric, but to a more instructive art 
<A NAME="473"></A>and a more real branch of knowledge; and as it is, rhetoric has been given 
<A NAME="474"></A>a far wider subject-matter than strictly belongs to it. The truth is, as 
<A NAME="475"></A>indeed we have said already, that rhetoric is a combination of the science 
<A NAME="476"></A>of logic and of the ethical branch of politics; and it is partly like dialectic, 
<A NAME="477"></A>partly like sophistical reasoning. But the more we try to make either dialectic 
<A NAME="478"></A>rhetoric not, what they really are, practical faculties, but sciences, 
<A NAME="479"></A>the more we shall inadvertently be destroying their true nature; for we 
<A NAME="480"></A>shall be re-fashioning them and shall be passing into the region of sciences 
<A NAME="481"></A>dealing with definite subjects rather than simply with words and forms 
<A NAME="482"></A>of reasoning. Even here, however, we will mention those points which it 
<A NAME="483"></A>is of practical importance to distinguish, their fuller treatment falling 
<A NAME="484"></A>naturally to political science.
<A NAME="485"></A><BR><BR>The main matters on which all men deliberate and on which political 
<A NAME="486"></A>speakers make speeches are some five in number: ways and means, war and 
<A NAME="487"></A>peace, national defence, imports and exports, and legislation.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR>As to Ways and Means, then, the intending speaker will need to 
<A NAME="489"></A>know the number and extent of the country's sources of revenue, so that, 
<A NAME="490"></A>if any is being overlooked, it may be added, and, if any is defective, 
<A NAME="491"></A>it may be increased. Further, he should know all the expenditure of the 
<A NAME="492"></A>country, in order that, if any part of it is superfluous, it may be abolished, 
<A NAME="493"></A>or, if any is too large, it may be reduced. For men become richer not only 
<A NAME="494"></A>by increasing their existing wealth but also by reducing their expenditure. 
<A NAME="495"></A>A comprehensive view of these questions cannot be gained solely from experience 
<A NAME="496"></A>in home affairs; in order to advise on such matters a man must be keenly 
<A NAME="497"></A>interested in the methods worked out in other lands.
<A NAME="498"></A><BR><BR>As to Peace and War, he must know the extent of the military strength 
<A NAME="499"></A>of his country, both actual and potential, and also the mature of that 
<A NAME="500"></A>actual and potential strength; and further, what wars his country has waged, 
<A NAME="501"></A>and how it has waged them. He must know these facts not only about his 
<A NAME="502"></A>own country, but also about neighbouring countries; and also about countries 
<A NAME="503"></A>with which war is likely, in order that peace may be maintained with those 
<A NAME="504"></A>stronger than his own, and that his own may have power to make war or not 
<A NAME="505"></A>against those that are weaker. He should know, too, whether the military 
<A NAME="506"></A>power of another country is like or unlike that of his own; for this is 
<A NAME="507"></A>a matter that may affect their relative strength. With the same end in 
<A NAME="508"></A>view he must, besides, have studied the wars of other countries as well 
<A NAME="509"></A>as those of his own, and the way they ended; similar causes are likely 
<A NAME="510"></A>to have similar results.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>With regard to National Defence: he ought to know all about the 
<A NAME="512"></A>methods of defence in actual use, such as the strength and character of 
<A NAME="513"></A>the defensive force and the positions of the forts-this last means that 
<A NAME="514"></A>he must be well acquainted with the lie of the country-in order that a 
<A NAME="515"></A>garrison may be increased if it is too small or removed if it is not wanted, 
<A NAME="516"></A>and that the strategic points may be guarded with special 
<A NAME="517"></A>care.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>With regard to the Food Supply: he must know what outlay will meet 
<A NAME="519"></A>the needs of his country; what kinds of food are produced at home and what 
<A NAME="520"></A>imported; and what articles must be exported or imported. This last he 
<A NAME="521"></A>must know in order that agreements and commercial treaties may be made 
<A NAME="522"></A>with the countries concerned. There are, indeed, two sorts of state to 
<A NAME="523"></A>which he must see that his countrymen give no cause for offence, states 
<A NAME="524"></A>stronger than his own, and states with which it is advantageous to 
<A NAME="525"></A>trade.
<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>But while he must, for security's sake, be able to take all this 
<A NAME="527"></A>into account, he must before all things understand the subject of legislation; 
<A NAME="528"></A>for it is on a country's laws that its whole welfare depends. He must, 
<A NAME="529"></A>therefore, know how many different forms of constitution there are; under 
<A NAME="530"></A>what conditions each of these will prosper and by what internal developments 
<A NAME="531"></A>or external attacks each of them tends to be destroyed. When I speak of 
<A NAME="532"></A>destruction through internal developments I refer to the fact that all 
<A NAME="533"></A>constitutions, except the best one of all, are destroyed both by not being 
<A NAME="534"></A>pushed far enough and by being pushed too far. Thus, democracy loses its 
<A NAME="535"></A>vigour, and finally passes into oligarchy, not only when it is not pushed 
<A NAME="536"></A>far enough, but also when it is pushed a great deal too far; just as the 
<A NAME="537"></A>aquiline and the snub nose not only turn into normal noses by not being 
<A NAME="538"></A>aquiline or snub enough, but also by being too violently aquiline or snub 
<A NAME="539"></A>arrive at a condition in which they no longer look like noses at all. It 
<A NAME="540"></A>is useful, in framing laws, not only to study the past history of one's 
<A NAME="541"></A>own country, in order to understand which constitution is desirable for 
<A NAME="542"></A>it now, but also to have a knowledge of the constitutions of other nations, 
<A NAME="543"></A>and so to learn for what kinds of nation the various kinds of constitution 
<A NAME="544"></A>are suited. From this we can see that books of travel are useful aids to 
<A NAME="545"></A>legislation, since from these we may learn the laws and customs of different 
<A NAME="546"></A>races. The political speaker will also find the researches of historians 
<A NAME="547"></A>useful. But all this is the business of political science and not of 
<A NAME="548"></A>rhetoric.
<A NAME="549"></A><BR><BR>These, then, are the most important kinds of information which 
<A NAME="550"></A>the political speaker must possess. Let us now go back and state the premisses 
<A NAME="551"></A>from which he will have to argue in favour of adopting or rejecting measures 
<A NAME="552"></A>regarding these and other matters.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="553"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>It may be said that every individual man and all men in common 
<A NAME="555"></A>aim at a certain end which determines what they choose and what they avoid. 
<A NAME="556"></A>This end, to sum it up briefly, is happiness and its constituents. Let 
<A NAME="557"></A>us, then, by way of illustration only, ascertain what is in general the 
<A NAME="558"></A>nature of happiness, and what are the elements of its constituent parts. 
<A NAME="559"></A>For all advice to do things or not to do them is concerned with happiness 
<A NAME="560"></A>and with the things that make for or against it; whatever creates or increases 
<A NAME="561"></A>happiness or some part of happiness, we ought to do; whatever destroys 
<A NAME="562"></A>or hampers happiness, or gives rise to its opposite, we ought not to 
<A NAME="563"></A>do.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>We may define happiness as prosperity combined with virtue; or 
<A NAME="565"></A>as independence of life; or as the secure enjoyment of the maximum of pleasure; 
<A NAME="566"></A>or as a good condition of property and body, together with the power of 
<A NAME="567"></A>guarding one's property and body and making use of them. That happiness 
<A NAME="568"></A>is one or more of these things, pretty well everybody 
<A NAME="569"></A>agrees.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR>From this definition of happiness it follows that its constituent 
<A NAME="571"></A>parts are:-good birth, plenty of friends, good friends, wealth, good children, 
<A NAME="572"></A>plenty of children, a happy old age, also such bodily excellences as health, 
<A NAME="573"></A>beauty, strength, large stature, athletic powers, together with fame, honour, 
<A NAME="574"></A>good luck, and virtue. A man cannot fail to be completely independent if 
<A NAME="575"></A>he possesses these internal and these external goods; for besides these 
<A NAME="576"></A>there are no others to have. (Goods of the soul and of the body are internal. 
<A NAME="577"></A>Good birth, friends, money, and honour are external.) Further, we think 
<A NAME="578"></A>that he should possess resources and luck, in order to make his life really 
<A NAME="579"></A>secure. As we have already ascertained what happiness in general is, so 
<A NAME="580"></A>now let us try to ascertain what of these parts of it 
<A NAME="581"></A>is.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>Now good birth in a race or a state means that its members are 
<A NAME="583"></A>indigenous or ancient: that its earliest leaders were distinguished men, 
<A NAME="584"></A>and that from them have sprung many who were distinguished for qualities 
<A NAME="585"></A>that we admire.
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR>The good birth of an individual, which may come either from the 
<A NAME="587"></A>male or the female side, implies that both parents are free citizens, and 
<A NAME="588"></A>that, as in the case of the state, the founders of the line have been notable 
<A NAME="589"></A>for virtue or wealth or something else which is highly prized, and that 
<A NAME="590"></A>many distinguished persons belong to the family, men and women, young and 
<A NAME="591"></A>old.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>The phrases 'possession of good children' and 'of many children' 
<A NAME="593"></A>bear a quite clear meaning. Applied to a community, they mean that its 
<A NAME="594"></A>young men are numerous and of good a quality: good in regard to bodily 
<A NAME="595"></A>excellences, such as stature, beauty, strength, athletic powers; and also 
<A NAME="596"></A>in regard to the excellences of the soul, which in a young man are temperance 
<A NAME="597"></A>and courage. Applied to an individual, they mean that his own children 
<A NAME="598"></A>are numerous and have the good qualities we have described. Both male and 
<A NAME="599"></A>female are here included; the excellences of the latter are, in body, beauty 
<A NAME="600"></A>and stature; in soul, self-command and an industry that is not sordid. 
<A NAME="601"></A>Communities as well as individuals should lack none of these perfections, 
<A NAME="602"></A>in their women as well as in their men. Where, as among the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="603"></A>the state of women is bad, almost half of human life is 
<A NAME="604"></A>spoilt.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>The constituents of wealth are: plenty of coined money and territory; 
<A NAME="606"></A>the ownership of numerous, large, and beautiful estates; also the ownership 
<A NAME="607"></A>of numerous and beautiful implements, live stock, and slaves. All these 
<A NAME="608"></A>kinds of property are our own, are secure, gentlemanly, and useful. The 
<A NAME="609"></A>useful kinds are those that are productive, the gentlemanly kinds are those 
<A NAME="610"></A>that provide enjoyment. By 'productive' I mean those from which we get 
<A NAME="611"></A>our income; by 'enjoyable', those from which we get nothing worth mentioning 
<A NAME="612"></A>except the use of them. The criterion of 'security' is the ownership of 
<A NAME="613"></A>property in such places and under such Conditions that the use of it is 
<A NAME="614"></A>in our power; and it is 'our own' if it is in our own power to dispose 
<A NAME="615"></A>of it or keep it. By 'disposing of it' I mean giving it away or selling 
<A NAME="616"></A>it. Wealth as a whole consists in using things rather than in owning them; 
<A NAME="617"></A>it is really the activity-that is, the use-of property that constitutes 
<A NAME="618"></A>wealth.
<A NAME="619"></A><BR><BR>Fame means being respected by everybody, or having some quality 
<A NAME="620"></A>that is desired by all men, or by most, or by the good, or by the 
<A NAME="621"></A>wise.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>Honour is the token of a man's being famous for doing good. it 
<A NAME="623"></A>is chiefly and most properly paid to those who have already done good; 
<A NAME="624"></A>but also to the man who can do good in future. Doing good refers either 
<A NAME="625"></A>to the preservation of life and the means of life, or to wealth, or to 
<A NAME="626"></A>some other of the good things which it is hard to get either always or 
<A NAME="627"></A>at that particular place or time-for many gain honour for things which 
<A NAME="628"></A>seem small, but the place and the occasion account for it. The constituents 
<A NAME="629"></A>of honour are: sacrifices; commemoration, in verse or prose; privileges; 
<A NAME="630"></A>grants of land; front seats at civic celebrations; state burial; statues; 
<A NAME="631"></A>public maintenance; among foreigners, obeisances and giving place; and 
<A NAME="632"></A>such presents as are among various bodies of men regarded as marks of honour. 
<A NAME="633"></A>For a present is not only the bestowal of a piece of property, but also 
<A NAME="634"></A>a token of honour; which explains why honour-loving as well as money-loving 
<A NAME="635"></A>persons desire it. The present brings to both what they want; it is a piece 
<A NAME="636"></A>of property, which is what the lovers of money desire; and it brings honour, 
<A NAME="637"></A>which is what the lovers of honour desire.
<A NAME="638"></A><BR><BR>The excellence of the body is health; that is, a condition which 
<A NAME="639"></A>allows us, while keeping free from disease, to have the use of our bodies; 
<A NAME="640"></A>for many people are 'healthy' as we are told Herodicus was; and these no 
<A NAME="641"></A>one can congratulate on their 'health', for they have to abstain from everything 
<A NAME="642"></A>or nearly everything that men do.-Beauty varies with the time of life. 
<A NAME="643"></A>In a young man beauty is the possession of a body fit to endure the exertion 
<A NAME="644"></A>of running and of contests of strength; which means that he is pleasant 
<A NAME="645"></A>to look at; and therefore all-round athletes are the most beautiful, being 
<A NAME="646"></A>naturally adapted both for contests of strength and for speed also. For 
<A NAME="647"></A>a man in his prime, beauty is fitness for the exertion of warfare, together 
<A NAME="648"></A>with a pleasant but at the same time formidable appearance. For an old 
<A NAME="649"></A>man, it is to be strong enough for such exertion as is necessary, and to 
<A NAME="650"></A>be free from all those deformities of old age which cause pain to others. 
<A NAME="651"></A>Strength is the power of moving some one else at will; to do this, you 
<A NAME="652"></A>must either pull, push, lift, pin, or grip him; thus you must be strong 
<A NAME="653"></A>in all of those ways or at least in some. Excellence in size is to surpass 
<A NAME="654"></A>ordinary people in height, thickness, and breadth by just as much as will 
<A NAME="655"></A>not make one's movements slower in consequence. Athletic excellence of 
<A NAME="656"></A>the body consists in size, strength, and swiftness; swiftness implying 
<A NAME="657"></A>strength. He who can fling forward his legs in a certain way, and move 
<A NAME="658"></A>them fast and far, is good at running; he who can grip and hold down is 
<A NAME="659"></A>good at wrestling; he who can drive an adversary from his ground with the 
<A NAME="660"></A>right blow is a good boxer: he who can do both the last is a good pancratiast, 
<A NAME="661"></A>while he who can do all is an 'all-round' athlete.
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>Happiness in old age is the coming of old age slowly and painlessly; 
<A NAME="663"></A>for a man has not this happiness if he grows old either quickly, or tardily 
<A NAME="664"></A>but painfully. It arises both from the excellences of the body and from 
<A NAME="665"></A>good luck. If a man is not free from disease, or if he is strong, he will 
<A NAME="666"></A>not be free from suffering; nor can he continue to live a long and painless 
<A NAME="667"></A>life unless he has good luck. There is, indeed, a capacity for long life 
<A NAME="668"></A>that is quite independent of health or strength; for many people live long 
<A NAME="669"></A>who lack the excellences of the body; but for our present purpose there 
<A NAME="670"></A>is no use in going into the details of this.
<A NAME="671"></A><BR><BR>The terms 'possession of many friends' and 'possession of good 
<A NAME="672"></A>friends' need no explanation; for we define a 'friend' as one who will 
<A NAME="673"></A>always try, for your sake, to do what he takes to be good for you. The 
<A NAME="674"></A>man towards whom many feel thus has many friends; if these are worthy men, 
<A NAME="675"></A>he has good friends.
<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR>'Good luck' means the acquisition or possession of all or most, 
<A NAME="677"></A>or the most important, of those good things which are due to luck. Some 
<A NAME="678"></A>of the things that are due to luck may also be due to artificial contrivance; 
<A NAME="679"></A>but many are independent of art, as for example those which are due to 
<A NAME="680"></A>nature-though, to be sure, things due to luck may actually be contrary 
<A NAME="681"></A>to nature. Thus health may be due to artificial contrivance, but beauty 
<A NAME="682"></A>and stature are due to nature. All such good things as excite envy are, 
<A NAME="683"></A>as a class, the outcome of good luck. Luck is also the cause of good things 
<A NAME="684"></A>that happen contrary to reasonable expectation: as when, for instance, 
<A NAME="685"></A>all your brothers are ugly, but you are handsome yourself; or when you 
<A NAME="686"></A>find a treasure that everybody else has overlooked; or when a missile hits 
<A NAME="687"></A>the next man and misses you; or when you are the only man not to go to 
<A NAME="688"></A>a place you have gone to regularly, while the others go there for the first 
<A NAME="689"></A>time and are killed. All such things are reckoned pieces of good 
<A NAME="690"></A>luck.
<A NAME="691"></A><BR><BR>As to virtue, it is most closely connected with the subject of 
<A NAME="692"></A>Eulogy, and therefore we will wait to define it until we come to discuss 
<A NAME="693"></A>that subject.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="694"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>It is now plain what our aims, future or actual, should be in urging, 
<A NAME="696"></A>and what in depreciating, a proposal; the latter being the opposite of 
<A NAME="697"></A>the former. Now the political or deliberative orator's aim is utility: 
<A NAME="698"></A>deliberation seeks to determine not ends but the means to ends, i.e. what 
<A NAME="699"></A>it is most useful to do. Further, utility is a good thing. We ought therefore 
<A NAME="700"></A>to assure ourselves of the main facts about Goodness and Utility in 
<A NAME="701"></A>general.
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>We may define a good thing as that which ought to be chosen for 
<A NAME="703"></A>its own sake; or as that for the sake of which we choose something else; 
<A NAME="704"></A>or as that which is sought after by all things, or by all things that have 
<A NAME="705"></A>sensation or reason, or which will be sought after by any things that acquire 
<A NAME="706"></A>reason; or as that which must be prescribed for a given individual by reason 
<A NAME="707"></A>generally, or is prescribed for him by his individual reason, this being 
<A NAME="708"></A>his individual good; or as that whose presence brings anything into a satisfactory 
<A NAME="709"></A>and self-sufficing condition; or as self-sufficiency; or as what produces, 
<A NAME="710"></A>maintains, or entails characteristics of this kind, while preventing and 
<A NAME="711"></A>destroying their opposites. One thing may entail another in either of two 
<A NAME="712"></A>ways-(1) simultaneously, (2) subsequently. Thus learning entails knowledge 
<A NAME="713"></A>subsequently, health entails life simultaneously. Things are productive 
<A NAME="714"></A>of other things in three senses: first as being healthy produces health; 
<A NAME="715"></A>secondly, as food produces health; and thirdly, as exercise does-i.e. it 
<A NAME="716"></A>does so usually. All this being settled, we now see that both the acquisition 
<A NAME="717"></A>of good things and the removal of bad things must be good; the latter entails 
<A NAME="718"></A>freedom from the evil things simultaneously, while the former entails possession 
<A NAME="719"></A>of the good things subsequently. The acquisition of a greater in place 
<A NAME="720"></A>of a lesser good, or of a lesser in place of a greater evil, is also good, 
<A NAME="721"></A>for in proportion as the greater exceeds the lesser there is acquisition 
<A NAME="722"></A>of good or removal of evil. The virtues, too, must be something good; for 
<A NAME="723"></A>it is by possessing these that we are in a good condition, and they tend 
<A NAME="724"></A>to produce good works and good actions. They must be severally named and 
<A NAME="725"></A>described elsewhere. Pleasure, again, must be a good thing, since it is 
<A NAME="726"></A>the nature of all animals to aim at it. Consequently both pleasant and 
<A NAME="727"></A>beautiful things must be good things, since the former are productive of 
<A NAME="728"></A>pleasure, while of the beautiful things some are pleasant and some desirable 
<A NAME="729"></A>in and for themselves.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR><BR>The following is a more detailed list of things that must be good. 
<A NAME="731"></A>Happiness, as being desirable in itself and sufficient by itself, and as 
<A NAME="732"></A>being that for whose sake we choose many other things. Also justice, courage, 
<A NAME="733"></A>temperance, magnanimity, magnificence, and all such qualities, as being 
<A NAME="734"></A>excellences of the soul. Further, health, beauty, and the like, as being 
<A NAME="735"></A>bodily excellences and productive of many other good things: for instance, 
<A NAME="736"></A>health is productive both of pleasure and of life, and therefore is thought 
<A NAME="737"></A>the greatest of goods, since these two things which it causes, pleasure 
<A NAME="738"></A>and life, are two of the things most highly prized by ordinary people. 
<A NAME="739"></A>Wealth, again: for it is the excellence of possession, and also productive 
<A NAME="740"></A>of many other good things. Friends and friendship: for a friend is desirable 
<A NAME="741"></A>in himself and also productive of many other good things. So, too, honour 
<A NAME="742"></A>and reputation, as being pleasant, and productive of many other good things, 
<A NAME="743"></A>and usually accompanied by the presence of the good things that cause them 
<A NAME="744"></A>to be bestowed. The faculty of speech and action; since all such qualities 
<A NAME="745"></A>are productive of what is good. Further-good parts, strong memory, receptiveness, 
<A NAME="746"></A>quickness of intuition, and the like, for all such faculties are productive 
<A NAME="747"></A>of what is good. Similarly, all the sciences and arts. And life: since, 
<A NAME="748"></A>even if no other good were the result of life, it is desirable in itself. 
<A NAME="749"></A>And justice, as the cause of good to the community.
<A NAME="750"></A><BR><BR>The above are pretty well all the things admittedly good. In dealing 
<A NAME="751"></A>with things whose goodness is disputed, we may argue in the following ways:-That 
<A NAME="752"></A>is good of which the contrary is bad. That is good the contrary of which 
<A NAME="753"></A>is to the advantage of our enemies; for example, if it is to the particular 
<A NAME="754"></A>advantage of our enemies that we should be cowards, clearly courage is 
<A NAME="755"></A>of particular value to our countrymen. And generally, the contrary of that 
<A NAME="756"></A>which our enemies desire, or of that at which they rejoice, is evidently 
<A NAME="757"></A>valuable. Hence the passage beginning: <BR><BR>"Surely would Priam exult. 
<A NAME="758"></A>"<BR><BR>

<A NAME="759"></A><BR><BR>This principle usually holds good, but not always, since it may 
<A NAME="760"></A>well be that our interest is sometimes the same as that of our enemies. 
<A NAME="761"></A>Hence it is said that 'evils draw men together'; that is, when the same 
<A NAME="762"></A>thing is hurtful to them both.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>Further: that which is not in excess is good, and that which is 
<A NAME="764"></A>greater than it should be is bad. That also is good on which much labour 
<A NAME="765"></A>or money has been spent; the mere fact of this makes it seem good, and 
<A NAME="766"></A>such a good is assumed to be an end-an end reached through a long chain 
<A NAME="767"></A>of means; and any end is a good. Hence the lines beginning: <BR><BR>"And 
<A NAME="768"></A>for Priam (and Troy-town's folk) should <BR><BR>"they leave behind them 
<A NAME="769"></A>a boast; "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="770"></A>and <BR><BR>"Oh, it were shame <BR><BR>"To have tarried so long and return 
<A NAME="771"></A>empty-handed <BR><BR>"as erst we came; "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="772"></A>and there is also the proverb about 'breaking the pitcher at the 
<A NAME="773"></A>door'.
<A NAME="774"></A><BR><BR>That which most people seek after, and which is obviously an object 
<A NAME="775"></A>of contention, is also a good; for, as has been shown, that is good which 
<A NAME="776"></A>is sought after by everybody, and 'most people' is taken to be equivalent 
<A NAME="777"></A>to 'everybody'. That which is praised is good, since no one praises what 
<A NAME="778"></A>is not good. So, again, that which is praised by our enemies [or by the 
<A NAME="779"></A>worthless] for when even those who have a grievance think a thing good, 
<A NAME="780"></A>it is at once felt that every one must agree with them; our enemies can 
<A NAME="781"></A>admit the fact only because it is evident, just as those must be worthless 
<A NAME="782"></A>whom their friends censure and their enemies do not. (For this reason the 
<A NAME="783"></A>Corinthians conceived themselves to be insulted by Simonides when he wrote: 
<A NAME="784"></A><BR><BR>"Against the Corinthians hath Ilium no complaint.) 
<A NAME="785"></A>"<BR><BR>

<A NAME="786"></A><BR><BR>Again, that is good which has been distinguished by the favour 
<A NAME="787"></A>of a discerning or virtuous man or woman, as Odysseus was distinguished 
<A NAME="788"></A>by Athena, Helen by Theseus, Paris by the goddesses, and Achilles by Homer. 
<A NAME="789"></A>And, generally speaking, all things are good which men deliberately choose 
<A NAME="790"></A>to do; this will include the things already mentioned, and also whatever 
<A NAME="791"></A>may be bad for their enemies or good for their friends, and at the same 
<A NAME="792"></A>time practicable. Things are 'practicable' in two senses: (1) it is possible 
<A NAME="793"></A>to do them, (2) it is easy to do them. Things are done 'easily' when they 
<A NAME="794"></A>are done either without pain or quickly: the 'difficulty' of an act lies 
<A NAME="795"></A>either in its painfulness or in the long time it takes. Again, a thing 
<A NAME="796"></A>is good if it is as men wish; and they wish to have either no evil at an 
<A NAME="797"></A>or at least a balance of good over evil. This last will happen where the 
<A NAME="798"></A>penalty is either imperceptible or slight. Good, too, are things that are 
<A NAME="799"></A>a man's very own, possessed by no one else, exceptional; for this increases 
<A NAME="800"></A>the credit of having them. So are things which befit the possessors, such 
<A NAME="801"></A>as whatever is appropriate to their birth or capacity, and whatever they 
<A NAME="802"></A>feel they ought to have but lack-such things may indeed be trifling, but 
<A NAME="803"></A>none the less men deliberately make them the goal of their action. And 
<A NAME="804"></A>things easily effected; for these are practicable (in the sense of being 
<A NAME="805"></A>easy); such things are those in which every one, or most people, or one's 
<A NAME="806"></A>equals, or one's inferiors have succeeded. Good also are the things by 
<A NAME="807"></A>which we shall gratify our friends or annoy our enemies; and the things 
<A NAME="808"></A>chosen by those whom we admire: and the things for which we are fitted 
<A NAME="809"></A>by nature or experience, since we think we shall succeed more easily in 
<A NAME="810"></A>these: and those in which no worthless man can succeed, for such things 
<A NAME="811"></A>bring greater praise: and those which we do in fact desire, for what we 
<A NAME="812"></A>desire is taken to be not only pleasant but also better. Further, a man 
<A NAME="813"></A>of a given disposition makes chiefly for the corresponding things: lovers 
<A NAME="814"></A>of victory make for victory, lovers of honour for honour, money-loving 
<A NAME="815"></A>men for money, and so with the rest. These, then, are the sources from 
<A NAME="816"></A>which we must derive our means of persuasion about Good and 
<A NAME="817"></A>Utility.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="818"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="819"></A><BR><BR>Since, however, it often happens that people agree that two things 
<A NAME="820"></A>are both useful but do not agree about which is the more so, the next step 
<A NAME="821"></A>will be to treat of relative goodness and relative utility.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR>A thing which surpasses another may be regarded as being that other 
<A NAME="823"></A>thing plus something more, and that other thing which is surpassed as being 
<A NAME="824"></A>what is contained in the first thing. Now to call a thing 'greater' or 
<A NAME="825"></A>'more' always implies a comparison of it with one that is 'smaller' or 
<A NAME="826"></A>'less', while 'great' and 'small', 'much' and 'little', are terms used 
<A NAME="827"></A>in comparison with normal magnitude. The 'great' is that which surpasses 
<A NAME="828"></A>the normal, the 'small' is that which is surpassed by the normal; and so 
<A NAME="829"></A>with 'many' and 'few'.
<A NAME="830"></A><BR><BR>Now we are applying the term 'good' to what is desirable for its 
<A NAME="831"></A>own sake and not for the sake of something else; to that at which all things 
<A NAME="832"></A>aim; to what they would choose if they could acquire understanding and 
<A NAME="833"></A>practical wisdom; and to that which tends to produce or preserve such goods, 
<A NAME="834"></A>or is always accompanied by them. Moreover, that for the sake of which 
<A NAME="835"></A>things are done is the end (an end being that for the sake of which all 
<A NAME="836"></A>else is done), and for each individual that thing is a good which fulfils 
<A NAME="837"></A>these conditions in regard to himself. It follows, then, that a greater 
<A NAME="838"></A>number of goods is a greater good than one or than a smaller number, if 
<A NAME="839"></A>that one or that smaller number is included in the count; for then the 
<A NAME="840"></A>larger number surpasses the smaller, and the smaller quantity is surpassed 
<A NAME="841"></A>as being contained in the larger.
<A NAME="842"></A><BR><BR>Again, if the largest member of one class surpasses the largest 
<A NAME="843"></A>member of another, then the one class surpasses the other; and if one class 
<A NAME="844"></A>surpasses another, then the largest member of the one surpasses the largest 
<A NAME="845"></A>member of the other. Thus, if the tallest man is taller than the tallest 
<A NAME="846"></A>woman, then men in general are taller than women. Conversely, if men in 
<A NAME="847"></A>general are taller than women, then the tallest man is taller than the 
<A NAME="848"></A>tallest woman. For the superiority of class over class is proportionate 
<A NAME="849"></A>to the superiority possessed by their largest specimens. Again, where one 
<A NAME="850"></A>good is always accompanied by another, but does not always accompany it, 
<A NAME="851"></A>it is greater than the other, for the use of the second thing is implied 
<A NAME="852"></A>in the use of the first. A thing may be accompanied by another in three 
<A NAME="853"></A>ways, either simultaneously, subsequently, or potentially. Life accompanies 
<A NAME="854"></A>health simultaneously (but not health life), knowledge accompanies the 
<A NAME="855"></A>act of learning subsequently, cheating accompanies sacrilege potentially, 
<A NAME="856"></A>since a man who has committed sacrilege is always capable of cheating. 
<A NAME="857"></A>Again, when two things each surpass a third, that which does so by the 
<A NAME="858"></A>greater amount is the greater of the two; for it must surpass the greater 
<A NAME="859"></A>as well as the less of the other two. A thing productive of a greater good 
<A NAME="860"></A>than another is productive of is itself a greater good than that other. 
<A NAME="861"></A>For this conception of 'productive of a greater' has been implied in our 
<A NAME="862"></A>argument. Likewise, that which is produced by a greater good is itself 
<A NAME="863"></A>a greater good; thus, if what is wholesome is more desirable and a greater 
<A NAME="864"></A>good than what gives pleasure, health too must be a greater good than pleasure. 
<A NAME="865"></A>Again, a thing which is desirable in itself is a greater good than a thing 
<A NAME="866"></A>which is not desirable in itself, as for example bodily strength than what 
<A NAME="867"></A>is wholesome, since the latter is not pursued for its own sake, whereas 
<A NAME="868"></A>the former is; and this was our definition of the good. Again, if one of 
<A NAME="869"></A>two things is an end, and the other is not, the former is the greater good, 
<A NAME="870"></A>as being chosen for its own sake and not for the sake of something else; 
<A NAME="871"></A>as, for example, exercise is chosen for the sake of physical well-being. 
<A NAME="872"></A>And of two things that which stands less in need of the other, or of other 
<A NAME="873"></A>things, is the greater good, since it is more self-sufficing. (That which 
<A NAME="874"></A>stands 'less' in need of others is that which needs either fewer or easier 
<A NAME="875"></A>things.) So when one thing does not exist or cannot come into existence 
<A NAME="876"></A>without a second, while the second can exist without the first, the second 
<A NAME="877"></A>is the better. That which does not need something else is more self-sufficing 
<A NAME="878"></A>than that which does, and presents itself as a greater good for that reason. 
<A NAME="879"></A>Again, that which is a beginning of other things is a greater good than 
<A NAME="880"></A>that which is not, and that which is a cause is a greater good than that 
<A NAME="881"></A>which is not; the reason being the same in each case, namely that without 
<A NAME="882"></A>a cause and a beginning nothing can exist or come into existence. Again, 
<A NAME="883"></A>where there are two sets of consequences arising from two different beginnings 
<A NAME="884"></A>or causes, the consequences of the more important beginning or cause are 
<A NAME="885"></A>themselves the more important; and conversely, that beginning or cause 
<A NAME="886"></A>is itself the more important which has the more important consequences. 
<A NAME="887"></A>Now it is plain, from all that has been said, that one thing may be shown 
<A NAME="888"></A>to be more important than another from two opposite points of view: it 
<A NAME="889"></A>may appear the more important (1) because it is a beginning and the other 
<A NAME="890"></A>thing is not, and also (2) because it is not a beginning and the other 
<A NAME="891"></A>thing is-on the ground that the end is more important and is not a beginning. 
<A NAME="892"></A>So Leodamas, when accusing Callistratus, said that the man who prompted 
<A NAME="893"></A>the deed was more guilty than the doer, since it would not have been done 
<A NAME="894"></A>if he had not planned it. On the other hand, when accusing Chabrias he 
<A NAME="895"></A>said that the doer was worse than the prompter, since there would have 
<A NAME="896"></A>been no deed without some one to do it; men, said he, plot a thing only 
<A NAME="897"></A>in order to carry it out.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR><BR>Further, what is rare is a greater good than what is plentiful. 
<A NAME="899"></A>Thus, gold is a better thing than iron, though less useful: it is harder 
<A NAME="900"></A>to get, and therefore better worth getting. Reversely, it may be argued 
<A NAME="901"></A>that the plentiful is a better thing than the rare, because we can make 
<A NAME="902"></A>more use of it. For what is often useful surpasses what is seldom useful, 
<A NAME="903"></A>whence the saying: <BR><BR>"The best of things is water. 
<A NAME="904"></A>"<BR><BR>

<A NAME="905"></A><BR><BR>More generally: the hard thing is better than the easy, because 
<A NAME="906"></A>it is rarer: and reversely, the easy thing is better than the hard, for 
<A NAME="907"></A>it is as we wish it to be. That is the greater good whose contrary is the 
<A NAME="908"></A>greater evil, and whose loss affects us more. Positive goodness and badness 
<A NAME="909"></A>are more important than the mere absence of goodness and badness: for positive 
<A NAME="910"></A>goodness and badness are ends, which the mere absence of them cannot be. 
<A NAME="911"></A>Further, in proportion as the functions of things are noble or base, the 
<A NAME="912"></A>things themselves are good or bad: conversely, in proportion as the things 
<A NAME="913"></A>themselves are good or bad, their functions also are good or bad; for the 
<A NAME="914"></A>nature of results corresponds with that of their causes and beginnings, 
<A NAME="915"></A>and conversely the nature of causes and beginnings corresponds with that 
<A NAME="916"></A>of their results. Moreover, those things are greater goods, superiority 
<A NAME="917"></A>in which is more desirable or more honourable. Thus, keenness of sight 
<A NAME="918"></A>is more desirable than keenness of smell, sight generally being more desirable 
<A NAME="919"></A>than smell generally; and similarly, unusually great love of friends being 
<A NAME="920"></A>more honourable than unusually great love of money, ordinary love of friends 
<A NAME="921"></A>is more honourable than ordinary love of money. Conversely, if one of two 
<A NAME="922"></A>normal things is better or nobler than the other, an unusual degree of 
<A NAME="923"></A>that thing is better or nobler than an unusual degree of the other. Again, 
<A NAME="924"></A>one thing is more honourable or better than another if it is more honourable 
<A NAME="925"></A>or better to desire it; the importance of the object of a given instinct 
<A NAME="926"></A>corresponds to the importance of the instinct itself; and for the same 
<A NAME="927"></A>reason, if one thing is more honourable or better than another, it is more 
<A NAME="928"></A>honourable and better to desire it. Again, if one science is more honourable 
<A NAME="929"></A>and valuable than another, the activity with which it deals is also more 
<A NAME="930"></A>honourable and valuable; as is the science, so is the reality that is its 
<A NAME="931"></A>object, each science being authoritative in its own sphere. So, also, the 
<A NAME="932"></A>more valuable and honourable the object of a science, the more valuable 
<A NAME="933"></A>and honourable the science itself is-in consequence. Again, that which 
<A NAME="934"></A>would be judged, or which has been judged, a good thing, or a better thing 
<A NAME="935"></A>than something else, by all or most people of understanding, or by the 
<A NAME="936"></A>majority of men, or by the ablest, must be so; either without qualification, 
<A NAME="937"></A>or in so far as they use their understanding to form their judgement. This 
<A NAME="938"></A>is indeed a general principle, applicable to all other judgements also; 
<A NAME="939"></A>not only the goodness of things, but their essence, magnitude, and general 
<A NAME="940"></A>nature are in fact just what knowledge and understanding will declare them 
<A NAME="941"></A>to be. Here the principle is applied to judgements of goodness, since one 
<A NAME="942"></A>definition of 'good' was 'what beings that acquire understanding will choose 
<A NAME="943"></A>in any given case': from which it clearly follows that that thing is hetter 
<A NAME="944"></A>which understanding declares to be so. That, again, is a better thing which 
<A NAME="945"></A>attaches to better men, either absolutely, or in virtue of their being 
<A NAME="946"></A>better; as courage is better than strength. And that is a greater good 
<A NAME="947"></A>which would be chosen by a better man, either absolutely, or in virtue 
<A NAME="948"></A>of his being better: for instance, to suffer wrong rather than to do wrong, 
<A NAME="949"></A>for that would be the choice of the juster man. Again, the pleasanter of 
<A NAME="950"></A>two things is the better, since all things pursue pleasure, and things 
<A NAME="951"></A>instinctively desire pleasurable sensation for its own sake; and these 
<A NAME="952"></A>are two of the characteristics by which the 'good' and the 'end' have been 
<A NAME="953"></A>defined. One pleasure is greater than another if it is more unmixed with 
<A NAME="954"></A>pain, or more lasting. Again, the nobler thing is better than the less 
<A NAME="955"></A>noble, since the noble is either what is pleasant or what is desirable 
<A NAME="956"></A>in itself. And those things also are greater goods which men desire more 
<A NAME="957"></A>earnestly to bring about for themselves or for their friends, whereas those 
<A NAME="958"></A>things which they least desire to bring about are greater evils. And those 
<A NAME="959"></A>things which are more lasting are better than those which are more fleeting, 
<A NAME="960"></A>and the more secure than the less; the enjoyment of the lasting has the 
<A NAME="961"></A>advantage of being longer, and that of the secure has the advantage of 
<A NAME="962"></A>suiting our wishes, being there for us whenever we like. Further, in accordance 
<A NAME="963"></A>with the rule of co-ordinate terms and inflexions of the same stem, what 
<A NAME="964"></A>is true of one such related word is true of all. Thus if the action qualified 
<A NAME="965"></A>by the term 'brave' is more noble and desirable than the action qualified 
<A NAME="966"></A>by the term 'temperate', then 'bravery' is more desirable than 'temperance' 
<A NAME="967"></A>and 'being brave' than 'being temperate'. That, again, which is chosen 
<A NAME="968"></A>by all is a greater good than that which is not, and that chosen by the 
<A NAME="969"></A>majority than that chosen by the minority. For that which all desire is 
<A NAME="970"></A>good, as we have said;' and so, the more a thing is desired, the better 
<A NAME="971"></A>it is. Further, that is the better thing which is considered so by competitors 
<A NAME="972"></A>or enemies, or, again, by authorized judges or those whom they select to 
<A NAME="973"></A>represent them. In the first two cases the decision is virtually that of 
<A NAME="974"></A>every one, in the last two that of authorities and experts. And sometimes 
<A NAME="975"></A>it may be argued that what all share is the better thing, since it is a 
<A NAME="976"></A>dishonour not to share in it; at other times, that what none or few share 
<A NAME="977"></A>is better, since it is rarer. The more praiseworthy things are, the nobler 
<A NAME="978"></A>and therefore the better they are. So with the things that earn greater 
<A NAME="979"></A>honours than others-honour is, as it were, a measure of value; and the 
<A NAME="980"></A>things whose absence involves comparatively heavy penalties; and the things 
<A NAME="981"></A>that are better than others admitted or believed to be good. Moreover, 
<A NAME="982"></A>things look better merely by being divided into their parts, since they 
<A NAME="983"></A>then seem to surpass a greater number of things than before. Hence Homer 
<A NAME="984"></A>says that Meleager was roused to battle by the thought of <BR><BR>"All 
<A NAME="985"></A>horrors that light on a folk whose city <BR><BR>"is ta'en of their foes, 
<A NAME="986"></A><BR><BR>"When they slaughter the men, when the burg is <BR><BR>"wasted 
<A NAME="987"></A>with ravening flame, <BR><BR>"When strangers are haling young children 
<A NAME="988"></A>to thraldom, <BR><BR>"(fair women to shame.) "<BR><BR>

<A NAME="989"></A><BR><BR>The same effect is produced by piling up facts in a climax after 
<A NAME="990"></A>the manner of Epicharmus. The reason is partly the same as in the case 
<A NAME="991"></A>of division (for combination too makes the impression of great superiority), 
<A NAME="992"></A>and partly that the original thing appears to be the cause and origin of 
<A NAME="993"></A>important results. And since a thing is better when it is harder or rarer 
<A NAME="994"></A>than other things, its superiority may be due to seasons, ages, places, 
<A NAME="995"></A>times, or one's natural powers. When a man accomplishes something beyond 
<A NAME="996"></A>his natural power, or beyond his years, or beyond the measure of people 
<A NAME="997"></A>like him, or in a special way, or at a special place or time, his deed 
<A NAME="998"></A>will have a high degree of nobleness, goodness, and justice, or of their 
<A NAME="999"></A>opposites. Hence the epigram on the victor at the Olympic games: <BR><BR>"In 
<A NAME="1000"></A>time past, hearing a Yoke on my shoulders, <BR><BR>"of wood unshaven, <BR><BR>"I 
<A NAME="1001"></A>carried my loads of fish from, Argos to Tegea town. 
<A NAME="1002"></A>"<BR><BR>

<A NAME="1003"></A><BR><BR>So Iphicrates used to extol himself by describing the low estate 
<A NAME="1004"></A>from which he had risen. Again, what is natural is better than what is 
<A NAME="1005"></A>acquired, since it is harder to come by. Hence the words of Homer: <BR><BR>"I 
<A NAME="1006"></A>have learnt from none but mysell. "<BR><BR>

<A NAME="1007"></A><BR><BR>And the best part of a good thing is particularly good; as when 
<A NAME="1008"></A>Pericles in his funeral oration said that the country's loss of its young 
<A NAME="1009"></A>men in battle was 'as if the spring were taken out of the year'. So with 
<A NAME="1010"></A>those things which are of service when the need is pressing; for example, 
<A NAME="1011"></A>in old age and times of sickness. And of two things that which leads more 
<A NAME="1012"></A>directly to the end in view is the better. So too is that which is better 
<A NAME="1013"></A>for people generally as well as for a particular individual. Again, what 
<A NAME="1014"></A>can be got is better than what cannot, for it is good in a given case and 
<A NAME="1015"></A>the other thing is not. And what is at the end of life is better than what 
<A NAME="1016"></A>is not, since those things are ends in a greater degree which are nearer 
<A NAME="1017"></A>the end. What aims at reality is better than what aims at appearance. We 
<A NAME="1018"></A>may define what aims at appearance as what a man will not choose if nobody 
<A NAME="1019"></A>is to know of his having it. This would seem to show that to receive benefits 
<A NAME="1020"></A>is more desirable than to confer them, since a man will choose the former 
<A NAME="1021"></A>even if nobody is to know of it, but it is not the general view that he 
<A NAME="1022"></A>will choose the latter if nobody knows of it. What a man wants to be is 
<A NAME="1023"></A>better than what a man wants to seem, for in aiming at that he is aiming 
<A NAME="1024"></A>more at reality. Hence men say that justice is of small value, since it 
<A NAME="1025"></A>is more desirable to seem just than to be just, whereas with health it 
<A NAME="1026"></A>is not so. That is better than other things which is more useful than they 
<A NAME="1027"></A>are for a number of different purposes; for example, that which promotes 
<A NAME="1028"></A>life, good life, pleasure, and noble conduct. For this reason wealth and 
<A NAME="1029"></A>health are commonly thought to be of the highest value, as possessing all 
<A NAME="1030"></A>these advantages. Again, that is better than other things which is accompanied 
<A NAME="1031"></A>both with less pain and with actual pleasure; for here there is more than 
<A NAME="1032"></A>one advantage; and so here we have the good of feeling pleasure and also 
<A NAME="1033"></A>the good of not feeling pain. And of two good things that is the better 
<A NAME="1034"></A>whose addition to a third thing makes a better whole than the addition 
<A NAME="1035"></A>of the other to the same thing will make. Again, those things which we 
<A NAME="1036"></A>are seen to possess are better than those which we are not seen to possess, 
<A NAME="1037"></A>since the former have the air of reality. Hence wealth may be regarded 
<A NAME="1038"></A>as a greater good if its existence is known to others. That which is dearly 
<A NAME="1039"></A>prized is better than what is not-the sort of thing that some people have 
<A NAME="1040"></A>only one of, though others have more like it. Accordingly, blinding a one-eyed 
<A NAME="1041"></A>man inflicts worse injury than half-blinding a man with two eyes; for the 
<A NAME="1042"></A>one-eyed man has been robbed of what he dearly prized.
<A NAME="1043"></A><BR><BR>The grounds on which we must base our arguments, when we are speaking 
<A NAME="1044"></A>for or against a proposal, have now been set forth more or less 
<A NAME="1045"></A>completely.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1046"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="1047"></A><BR><BR>The most important and effective qualification for success in persuading 
<A NAME="1048"></A>audiences and speaking well on public affairs is to understand all the 
<A NAME="1049"></A>forms of government and to discriminate their respective customs, institutions, 
<A NAME="1050"></A>and interests. For all men are persuaded by considerations of their interest, 
<A NAME="1051"></A>and their interest lies in the maintenance of the established order. Further, 
<A NAME="1052"></A>it rests with the supreme authority to give authoritative decisions, and 
<A NAME="1053"></A>this varies with each form of government; there are as many different supreme 
<A NAME="1054"></A>authorities as there are different forms of government. The forms of government 
<A NAME="1055"></A>are four-democracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, monarchy. The supreme right 
<A NAME="1056"></A>to judge and decide always rests, therefore, with either a part or the 
<A NAME="1057"></A>whole of one or other of these governing powers.
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR><BR>A Democracy is a form of government under which the citizens distribute 
<A NAME="1059"></A>the offices of state among themselves by lot, whereas under oligarchy there 
<A NAME="1060"></A>is a property qualification, under aristocracy one of education. By education 
<A NAME="1061"></A>I mean that education which is laid down by the law; for it is those who 
<A NAME="1062"></A>have been loyal to the national institutions that hold office under an 
<A NAME="1063"></A>aristocracy. These are bound to be looked upon as 'the best men', and it 
<A NAME="1064"></A>is from this fact that this form of government has derived its name ('the 
<A NAME="1065"></A>rule of the best'). Monarchy, as the word implies, is the constitution 
<A NAME="1066"></A>a in which one man has authority over all. There are two forms of monarchy: 
<A NAME="1067"></A>kingship, which is limited by prescribed conditions, and 'tyranny', which 
<A NAME="1068"></A>is not limited by anything.
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR><BR>We must also notice the ends which the various forms of government 
<A NAME="1070"></A>pursue, since people choose in practice such actions as will lead to the 
<A NAME="1071"></A>realization of their ends. The end of democracy is freedom; of oligarchy, 
<A NAME="1072"></A>wealth; of aristocracy, the maintenance of education and national institutions; 
<A NAME="1073"></A>of tyranny, the protection of the tyrant. It is clear, then, that we must 
<A NAME="1074"></A>distinguish those particular customs, institutions, and interests which 
<A NAME="1075"></A>tend to realize the ideal of each constitution, since men choose their 
<A NAME="1076"></A>means with reference to their ends. But rhetorical persuasion is effected 
<A NAME="1077"></A>not only by demonstrative but by ethical argument; it helps a speaker to 
<A NAME="1078"></A>convince us, if we believe that he has certain qualities himself, namely, 
<A NAME="1079"></A>goodness, or goodwill towards us, or both together. Similarly, we should 
<A NAME="1080"></A>know the moral qualities characteristic of each form of government, for 
<A NAME="1081"></A>the special moral character of each is bound to provide us with our most 
<A NAME="1082"></A>effective means of persuasion in dealing with it. We shall learn the qualities 
<A NAME="1083"></A>of governments in the same way as we learn the qualities of individuals, 
<A NAME="1084"></A>since they are revealed in their deliberate acts of choice; and these are 
<A NAME="1085"></A>determined by the end that inspires them.
<A NAME="1086"></A><BR><BR>We have now considered the objects, immediate or distant, at which 
<A NAME="1087"></A>we are to aim when urging any proposal, and the grounds on which we are 
<A NAME="1088"></A>to base our arguments in favour of its utility. We have also briefly considered 
<A NAME="1089"></A>the means and methods by which we shall gain a good knowledge of the moral 
<A NAME="1090"></A>qualities and institutions peculiar to the various forms of government-only, 
<A NAME="1091"></A>however, to the extent demanded by the present occasion; a detailed account 
<A NAME="1092"></A>of the subject has been given in the Politics.
