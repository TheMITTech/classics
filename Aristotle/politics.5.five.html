<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part I</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>The design which we proposed to ourselves is now nearly completed. Next 
<A NAME="12"></A>in order follow the causes of revolution in states, how many, and of what 
<A NAME="13"></A>nature they are; what modes of destruction apply to particular states, 
<A NAME="14"></A>and out of what, and into what they mostly change; also what are the modes 
<A NAME="15"></A>of preservation in states generally, or in a particular state, and by what 
<A NAME="16"></A>means each state may be best preserved: these questions remain to be 
<A NAME="17"></A>considered.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>In the first place we must assume as our starting-point that in 
<A NAME="19"></A>the many forms of government which have sprung up there has always been 
<A NAME="20"></A>an acknowledgment of justice and proportionate equality, although mankind 
<A NAME="21"></A>fail attaining them, as I have already explained. Democracy, for example, 
<A NAME="22"></A>arises out of the notion that those who are equal in any respect are equal 
<A NAME="23"></A>in all respects; because men are equally free, they claim to be absolutely 
<A NAME="24"></A>equal. Oligarchy is based on the notion that those who are unequal in one 
<A NAME="25"></A>respect are in all respects unequal; being unequal, that is, in property, 
<A NAME="26"></A>they suppose themselves to be unequal absolutely. The democrats think that 
<A NAME="27"></A>as they are equal they ought to be equal in all things; while the oligarchs, 
<A NAME="28"></A>under the idea that they are unequal, claim too much, which is one form 
<A NAME="29"></A>of inequality. All these forms of government have a kind of justice, but, 
<A NAME="30"></A>tried by an absolute standard, they are faulty; and, therefore, both parties, 
<A NAME="31"></A>whenever their share in the government does not accord with their preconceived 
<A NAME="32"></A>ideas, stir up revolution. Those who excel in virtue have the best right 
<A NAME="33"></A>of all to rebel (for they alone can with reason be deemed absolutely unequal), 
<A NAME="34"></A>but then they are of all men the least inclined to do so. There is also 
<A NAME="35"></A>a superiority which is claimed by men of rank; for they are thought noble 
<A NAME="36"></A>because they spring from wealthy and virtuous ancestors. Here then, so 
<A NAME="37"></A>to speak, are opened the very springs and fountains of revolution; and 
<A NAME="38"></A>hence arise two sorts of changes in governments; the one affecting the 
<A NAME="39"></A>constitution, when men seek to change from an existing form into some other, 
<A NAME="40"></A>for example, from democracy into oligarchy, and from oligarchy into democracy, 
<A NAME="41"></A>or from either of them into constitutional government or aristocracy, and 
<A NAME="42"></A>conversely; the other not affecting the constitution, when, without disturbing 
<A NAME="43"></A>the form of government, whether oligarchy, or monarchy, or any other, they 
<A NAME="44"></A>try to get the administration into their own hands. Further, there is a 
<A NAME="45"></A>question of degree; an oligarchy, for example, may become more or less 
<A NAME="46"></A>oligarchical, and a democracy more or less democratical; and in like manner 
<A NAME="47"></A>the characteristics of the other forms of government may be more or less 
<A NAME="48"></A>strictly maintained. Or the revolution may be directed against a portion 
<A NAME="49"></A>of the constitution only, e.g., the establishment or overthrow of a particular 
<A NAME="50"></A>office: as at Sparta it is said that Lysander attempted to overthrow the 
<A NAME="51"></A>monarchy, and King Pausanias, the Ephoralty. At Epidamnus, too, the change 
<A NAME="52"></A>was partial. For instead of phylarchs or heads of tribes, a council was 
<A NAME="53"></A>appointed; but to this day the magistrates are the only members of the 
<A NAME="54"></A>ruling class who are compelled to go to the Heliaea when an election takes 
<A NAME="55"></A>place, and the office of the single archon was another oligarchical feature. 
<A NAME="56"></A>Everywhere inequality is a cause of revolution, but an inequality in which 
<A NAME="57"></A>there is no proportion- for instance, a perpetual monarchy among equals; 
<A NAME="58"></A>and always it is the desire of equality which rises in 
<A NAME="59"></A>rebellion.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>Now equality is of two kinds, numerical and proportional; by the 
<A NAME="61"></A>first I mean sameness or equality in number or size; by the second, equality 
<A NAME="62"></A>of ratios. For example, the excess of three over two is numerically equal 
<A NAME="63"></A>to the excess of two over one; whereas four exceeds two in the same ratio 
<A NAME="64"></A>in which two exceeds one, for two is the same part of four that one is 
<A NAME="65"></A>of two, namely, the half. As I was saying before, men agree that justice 
<A NAME="66"></A>in the abstract is proportion, but they differ in that some think that 
<A NAME="67"></A>if they are equal in any respect they are equal absolutely, others that 
<A NAME="68"></A>if they are unequal in any respect they should be unequal in all. Hence 
<A NAME="69"></A>there are two principal forms of government, democracy and oligarchy; for 
<A NAME="70"></A>good birth and virtue are rare, but wealth and numbers are more common. 
<A NAME="71"></A>In what city shall we find a hundred persons of good birth and of virtue? 
<A NAME="72"></A>whereas the rich everywhere abound. That a state should be ordered, simply 
<A NAME="73"></A>and wholly, according to either kind of equality, is not a good thing; 
<A NAME="74"></A>the proof is the fact that such forms of government never last. They are 
<A NAME="75"></A>originally based on a mistake, and, as they begin badly, cannot fall to 
<A NAME="76"></A>end badly. The inference is that both kinds of equality should be employed; 
<A NAME="77"></A>numerical in some cases, and proportionate in others.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>Still democracy appears to be safer and less liable to revolution 
<A NAME="79"></A>than oligarchy. For in oligarchies there is the double danger of the oligarchs 
<A NAME="80"></A>falling out among themselves and also with the people; but in democracies 
<A NAME="81"></A>there is only the danger of a quarrel with the oligarchs. No dissension 
<A NAME="82"></A>worth mentioning arises among the people themselves. And we may further 
<A NAME="83"></A>remark that a government which is composed of the middle class more nearly 
<A NAME="84"></A>approximates to democracy than to oligarchy, and is the safest of the imperfect 
<A NAME="85"></A>forms of government.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="86"></A><B>Part II</B>

<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>In considering how dissensions and poltical revolutions arise, 
<A NAME="88"></A>we must first of all ascertain the beginnings and causes of them which 
<A NAME="89"></A>affect constitutions generally. They may be said to be three in number; 
<A NAME="90"></A>and we have now to give an outline of each. We want to know (1) what is 
<A NAME="91"></A>the feeling? (2) what are the motives of those who make them? (3) whence 
<A NAME="92"></A>arise political disturbances and quarrels? The universal and chief cause 
<A NAME="93"></A>of this revolutionary feeling has been already mentioned; viz., the desire 
<A NAME="94"></A>of equality, when men think that they are equal to others who have more 
<A NAME="95"></A>than themselves; or, again, the desire of inequality and superiority, when 
<A NAME="96"></A>conceiving themselves to be superior they think that they have not more 
<A NAME="97"></A>but the same or less than their inferiors; pretensions which may and may 
<A NAME="98"></A>not be just. Inferiors revolt in order that they may be equal, and equals 
<A NAME="99"></A>that they may be superior. Such is the state of mind which creates revolutions. 
<A NAME="100"></A>The motives for making them are the desire of gain and honor, or the fear 
<A NAME="101"></A>of dishonor and loss; the authors of them want to divert punishment or 
<A NAME="102"></A>dishonor from themselves or their friends. The causes and reasons of revolutions, 
<A NAME="103"></A>whereby men are themselves affected in the way described, and about the 
<A NAME="104"></A>things which I have mentioned, viewed in one way may be regarded as seven, 
<A NAME="105"></A>and in another as more than seven. Two of them have been already noticed; 
<A NAME="106"></A>but they act in a different manner, for men are excited against one another 
<A NAME="107"></A>by the love of gain and honor- not, as in the case which I have just supposed, 
<A NAME="108"></A>in order to obtain them for themselves, but at seeing others, justly or 
<A NAME="109"></A>unjustly, engrossing them. Other causes are insolence, fear, excessive 
<A NAME="110"></A>predominance, contempt, disproportionate increase in some part of the state; 
<A NAME="111"></A>causes of another sort are election intrigues, carelessness, neglect about 
<A NAME="112"></A>trifles, dissimilarity of elements.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="113"></A><B>Part III</B>

<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>What share insolence and avarice have in creating revolutions, 
<A NAME="115"></A>and how they work, is plain enough. When the magistrates are insolent and 
<A NAME="116"></A>grasping they conspire against one another and also against the constitution 
<A NAME="117"></A>from which they derive their power, making their gains either at the expense 
<A NAME="118"></A>of individuals or of the public. It is evident, again, what an influence 
<A NAME="119"></A>honor exerts and how it is a cause of revolution. Men who are themselves 
<A NAME="120"></A>dishonored and who see others obtaining honors rise in rebellion; the honor 
<A NAME="121"></A>or dishonor when undeserved is unjust; and just when awarded according 
<A NAME="122"></A>to merit.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>Again, superiority is a cause of revolution when one or more persons 
<A NAME="124"></A>have a power which is too much for the state and the power of the government; 
<A NAME="125"></A>this is a condition of affairs out of which there arises a monarchy, or 
<A NAME="126"></A>a family oligarchy. And therefore, in some places, as at Athens and Argos, 
<A NAME="127"></A>they have recourse to ostracism. But how much better to provide from the 
<A NAME="128"></A>first that there should be no such pre-eminent individuals instead of letting 
<A NAME="129"></A>them come into existence and then finding a remedy.
<A NAME="130"></A><BR><BR>Another cause of revolution is fear. Either men have committed 
<A NAME="131"></A>wrong, and are afraid of punishment, or they are expecting to suffer wrong 
<A NAME="132"></A>and are desirous of anticipating their enemy. Thus at Rhodes the notables 
<A NAME="133"></A>conspired against the people through fear of the suits that were brought 
<A NAME="134"></A>against them. Contempt is also a cause of insurrection and revolution; 
<A NAME="135"></A>for example, in oligarchies- when those who have no share in the state 
<A NAME="136"></A>are the majority, they revolt, because they think that they are the stronger. 
<A NAME="137"></A>Or, again, in democracies, the rich despise the disorder and anarchy of 
<A NAME="138"></A>the state; at Thebes, for example, where, after the battle of Oenophyta, 
<A NAME="139"></A>the bad administration of the democracy led to its ruin. At Megara the 
<A NAME="140"></A>fall of the democracy was due to a defeat occasioned by disorder and anarchy. 
<A NAME="141"></A>And at Syracuse the democracy aroused contempt before the tyranny of Gelo 
<A NAME="142"></A>arose; at Rhodes, before the insurrection.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>Political revolutions also spring from a disproportionate increase 
<A NAME="144"></A>in any part of the state. For as a body is made up of many members, and 
<A NAME="145"></A>every member ought to grow in proportion, that symmetry may be preserved; 
<A NAME="146"></A>but loses its nature if the foot be four cubits long and the rest of the 
<A NAME="147"></A>body two spans; and, should the abnormal increase be one of quality as 
<A NAME="148"></A>well as of quantity, may even take the form of another animal: even so 
<A NAME="149"></A>a state has many parts, of which some one may often grow imperceptibly; 
<A NAME="150"></A>for example, the number of poor in democracies and in constitutional states. 
<A NAME="151"></A>And this disproportion may sometimes happen by an accident, as at Tarentum, 
<A NAME="152"></A>from a defeat in which many of the notables were slain in a battle with 
<A NAME="153"></A>the Iapygians just after the Persian War, the constitutional government 
<A NAME="154"></A>in consequence becoming a democracy; or as was the case at Argos, where 
<A NAME="155"></A>the Argives, after their army had been cut to pieces on the seventh day 
<A NAME="156"></A>of the month by Cleomenes the Lacedaemonian, were compelled to admit to 
<A NAME="157"></A>citizen some of their Perioeci; and at Athens, when, after frequent defeats 
<A NAME="158"></A>of their infantry at the time of the Peloponnesian War, the notables were 
<A NAME="159"></A>reduced in number, because the soldiers had to be taken from the roll of 
<A NAME="160"></A>citizens. Revolutions arise from this cause as well, in democracies as 
<A NAME="161"></A>in other forms of government, but not to so great an extent. When the rich 
<A NAME="162"></A>grow numerous or properties increase, the form of government changes into 
<A NAME="163"></A>an oligarchy or a government of families. Forms of government also change- 
<A NAME="164"></A>sometimes even without revolution, owing to election contests, as at Heraea 
<A NAME="165"></A>(where, instead of electing their magistrates, they took them by lot, because 
<A NAME="166"></A>the electors were in the habit of choosing their own partisans); or owing 
<A NAME="167"></A>to carelessness, when disloyal persons are allowed to find their way into 
<A NAME="168"></A>the highest offices, as at Oreum, where, upon the accession of Heracleodorus 
<A NAME="169"></A>to office, the oligarchy was overthrown, and changed by him into a constitutional 
<A NAME="170"></A>and democratical government.
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>Again, the revolution may be facilitated by the slightness of the 
<A NAME="172"></A>change; I mean that a great change may sometimes slip into the constitution 
<A NAME="173"></A>through neglect of a small matter; at Ambracia, for instance, the qualification 
<A NAME="174"></A>for office, small at first, was eventually reduced to nothing. For the 
<A NAME="175"></A>Ambraciots thought that a small qualification was much the same as none 
<A NAME="176"></A>at all.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>Another cause of revolution is difference of races which do not 
<A NAME="178"></A>at once acquire a common spirit; for a state is not the growth of a day, 
<A NAME="179"></A>any more than it grows out of a multitude brought together by accident. 
<A NAME="180"></A>Hence the reception of strangers in colonies, either at the time of their 
<A NAME="181"></A>foundation or afterwards, has generally produced revolution; for example, 
<A NAME="182"></A>the Achaeans who joined the Troezenians in the foundation of Sybaris, becoming 
<A NAME="183"></A>later the more numerous, expelled them; hence the curse fell upon Sybaris. 
<A NAME="184"></A>At Thurii the Sybarites quarrelled with their fellow-colonists; thinking 
<A NAME="185"></A>that the land belonged to them, they wanted too much of it and were driven 
<A NAME="186"></A>out. At Byzantium the new colonists were detected in a conspiracy, and 
<A NAME="187"></A>were expelled by force of arms; the people of Antissa, who had received 
<A NAME="188"></A>the Chian exiles, fought with them, and drove them out; and the Zancleans, 
<A NAME="189"></A>after having received the Samians, were driven by them out of their own 
<A NAME="190"></A>city. The citizens of Apollonia on the Euxine, after the introduction of 
<A NAME="191"></A>a fresh body of colonists, had a revolution; the Syracusans, after the 
<A NAME="192"></A>expulsion of their tyrants, having admitted strangers and mercenaries to 
<A NAME="193"></A>the rights of citizenship, quarrelled and came to blows; the people of 
<A NAME="194"></A>Amphipolis, having received Chalcidian colonists, were nearly all expelled 
<A NAME="195"></A>by them.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>Now, in oligarchies the masses make revolution under the idea that 
<A NAME="197"></A>they are unjustly treated, because, as I said before, they are equals, 
<A NAME="198"></A>and have not an equal share, and in democracies the notables revolt, because 
<A NAME="199"></A>they are not equals, and yet have only an equal share.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>Again, the situation of cities is a cause of revolution when the 
<A NAME="201"></A>country is not naturally adapted to preserve the unity of the state. For 
<A NAME="202"></A>example, the Chytians at Clazomenae did not agree with the people of the 
<A NAME="203"></A>island; and the people of Colophon quarrelled with the Notians; at Athens 
<A NAME="204"></A>too, the inhabitants of the Piraeus are more democratic than those who 
<A NAME="205"></A>live in the city. For just as in war the impediment of a ditch, though 
<A NAME="206"></A>ever so small, may break a regiment, so every cause of difference, however 
<A NAME="207"></A>slight, makes a breach in a city. The greatest opposition is confessedly 
<A NAME="208"></A>that of virtue and vice; next comes that of wealth and poverty; and there 
<A NAME="209"></A>are other antagonistic elements, greater or less, of which one is this 
<A NAME="210"></A>difference of place.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="211"></A><B>Part IV</B>

<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>In revolutions the occasions may be trifling, but great interests 
<A NAME="213"></A>are at stake. Even trifles are most important when they concern the rulers, 
<A NAME="214"></A>as was the case of old at Syracuse; for the Syracusan constitution was 
<A NAME="215"></A>once changed by a love-quarrel of two young men, who were in the government. 
<A NAME="216"></A>The story is that while one of them was away from home his beloved was 
<A NAME="217"></A>gained over by his companion, and he to revenge himself seduced the other's 
<A NAME="218"></A>wife. They then drew the members of the ruling class into their quarrel 
<A NAME="219"></A>and so split all the people into portions. We learn from this story that 
<A NAME="220"></A>we should be on our guard against the beginnings of such evils, and should 
<A NAME="221"></A>put an end to the quarrels of chiefs and mighty men. The mistake lies in 
<A NAME="222"></A>the beginning- as the proverb says- 'Well begun is half done'; so an error 
<A NAME="223"></A>at the beginning, though quite small, bears the same ratio to the errors 
<A NAME="224"></A>in the other parts. In general, when the notables quarrel, the whole city 
<A NAME="225"></A>is involved, as happened in Hesdaea after the Persian War. The occasion 
<A NAME="226"></A>was the division of an inheritance; one of two brothers refused to give 
<A NAME="227"></A>an account of their father's property and the treasure which he had found: 
<A NAME="228"></A>so the poorer of the two quarrelled with him and enlisted in his cause 
<A NAME="229"></A>the popular party, the other, who was very rich, the wealthy 
<A NAME="230"></A>classes.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>At Delphi, again, a quarrel about a marriage was the beginning 
<A NAME="232"></A>of all the troubles which followed. In this case the bridegroom, fancying 
<A NAME="233"></A>some occurrence to be of evil omen, came to the bride, and went away without 
<A NAME="234"></A>taking her. Whereupon her relations, thinking that they were insulted by 
<A NAME="235"></A>him, put some of the sacred treasure among his offerings while he was sacrificing, 
<A NAME="236"></A>and then slew him, pretending that he had been robbing the temple. At Mytilene, 
<A NAME="237"></A>too, a dispute about heiresses was the beginning of many misfortunes, and 
<A NAME="238"></A>led to the war with the Athenians in which Paches took their city. A wealthy 
<A NAME="239"></A>citizen, named Timophanes, left two daughters; Dexander, another citizen, 
<A NAME="240"></A>wanted to obtain them for his sons; but he was rejected in his suit, whereupon 
<A NAME="241"></A>he stirred up a revolution, and instigated the Athenians (of whom he was 
<A NAME="242"></A>proxenus) to interfere. A similar quarrel about an heiress arose at Phocis 
<A NAME="243"></A>between Mnaseas the father of Mnason, and Euthycrates the father of Onomarchus; 
<A NAME="244"></A>this was the beginning of the Sacred War. A marriage-quarrel was also the 
<A NAME="245"></A>cause of a change in the government of Epidamnus. A certain man betrothed 
<A NAME="246"></A>his daughter to a person whose father, having been made a magistrate, fined 
<A NAME="247"></A>the father of the girl, and the latter, stung by the insult, conspired 
<A NAME="248"></A>with the unenfranchised classes to overthrow the state.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>Governments also change into oligarchy or into democracy or into 
<A NAME="250"></A>a constitutional government because the magistrates, or some other section 
<A NAME="251"></A>of the state, increase in power or renown. Thus at Athens the reputation 
<A NAME="252"></A>gained by the court of the Areopagus, in the Persian War, seemed to tighten 
<A NAME="253"></A>the reins of government. On the other hand, the victory of Salamis, which 
<A NAME="254"></A>was gained by the common people who served in the fleet, and won for the 
<A NAME="255"></A>Athenians the empire due to command of the sea, strengthened the democracy. 
<A NAME="256"></A>At Argos, the notables, having distinguished themselves against the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="257"></A>in the battle of Mantinea, attempted to put down the democracy. At Syracuse, 
<A NAME="258"></A>the people, having been the chief authors of the victory in the war with 
<A NAME="259"></A>the Athenians, changed the constitutional government into democracy. At 
<A NAME="260"></A>Chalcis, the people, uniting with the notables, killed Phoxus the tyrant, 
<A NAME="261"></A>and then seized the government. At Ambracia, the people, in like manner, 
<A NAME="262"></A>having joined with the conspirators in expelling the tyrant Periander, 
<A NAME="263"></A>transferred the government to themselves. And generally it should be remembered 
<A NAME="264"></A>that those who have secured power to the state, whether private citizens, 
<A NAME="265"></A>or magistrates, or tribes, or any other part or section of the state, are 
<A NAME="266"></A>apt to cause revolutions. For either envy of their greatness draws others 
<A NAME="267"></A>into rebellion, or they themselves, in their pride of superiority, are 
<A NAME="268"></A>unwilling to remain on a level with others.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>Revolutions also break out when opposite parties, e.g., the rich 
<A NAME="270"></A>and the people, are equally balanced, and there is little or no middle 
<A NAME="271"></A>class; for, if either party were manifestly superior, the other would not 
<A NAME="272"></A>risk an attack upon them. And, for this reason, those who are eminent in 
<A NAME="273"></A>virtue usually do not stir up insurrections, always being a minority. Such 
<A NAME="274"></A>are the beginnings and causes of the disturbances and revolutions to which 
<A NAME="275"></A>every form of government is liable.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>Revolutions are effected in two ways, by force and by fraud. Force 
<A NAME="277"></A>may be applied either at the time of making the revolution or afterwards. 
<A NAME="278"></A>Fraud, again, is of two kinds; for (1) sometimes the citizens are deceived 
<A NAME="279"></A>into acquiescing in a change of government, and afterwards they are held 
<A NAME="280"></A>in subjection against their will. This was what happened in the case of 
<A NAME="281"></A>the Four Hundred, who deceived the people by telling them that the king 
<A NAME="282"></A>would provide money for the war against the Lacedaemonians, and, having 
<A NAME="283"></A>cheated the people, still endeavored to retain the government. (2) In other 
<A NAME="284"></A>cases the people are persuaded at first, and afterwards, by a repetition 
<A NAME="285"></A>of the persuasion, their goodwill and allegiance are retained. The revolutions 
<A NAME="286"></A>which effect constitutions generally spring from the above-mentioned 
<A NAME="287"></A>causes.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="288"></A><B>Part V</B>

<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>And now, taking each constitution separately, we must see what 
<A NAME="290"></A>follows from the principles already laid down.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>Revolutions in democracies are generally caused by the intemperance 
<A NAME="292"></A>of demagogues, who either in their private capacity lay information against 
<A NAME="293"></A>rich men until they compel them to combine (for a common danger unites 
<A NAME="294"></A>even the bitterest enemies), or coming forward in public stir up the people 
<A NAME="295"></A>against them. The truth of this remark is proved by a variety of examples. 
<A NAME="296"></A>At Cos the democracy was overthrown because wicked demagogues arose, and 
<A NAME="297"></A>the notables combined. At Rhodes the demagogues not only provided pay for 
<A NAME="298"></A>the multitude, but prevented them from making good to the trierarchs the 
<A NAME="299"></A>sums which had been expended by them; and they, in consequence of the suits 
<A NAME="300"></A>which were brought against them, were compelled to combine and put down 
<A NAME="301"></A>the democracy. The democracy at Heraclea was overthrown shortly after the 
<A NAME="302"></A>foundation of the colony by the injustice of the demagogues, which drove 
<A NAME="303"></A>out the notables, who came back in a body and put an end to the democracy. 
<A NAME="304"></A>Much in the same manner the democracy at Megara was overturned; there the 
<A NAME="305"></A>demagogues drove out many of the notables in order that they might be able 
<A NAME="306"></A>to confiscate their property. At length the exiles, becoming numerous, 
<A NAME="307"></A>returned, and, engaging and defeating the people, established the oligarchy. 
<A NAME="308"></A>The same thing happened with the democracy of Cyme, which was overthrown 
<A NAME="309"></A>by Thrasymachus. And we may observe that in most states the changes have 
<A NAME="310"></A>been of this character. For sometimes the demagogues, in order to curry 
<A NAME="311"></A>favor with the people, wrong the notables and so force them to combine; 
<A NAME="312"></A>either they make a division of their property, or diminish their incomes 
<A NAME="313"></A>by the imposition of public services, and sometimes they bring accusations 
<A NAME="314"></A>against the rich that they may have their wealth to 
<A NAME="315"></A>confiscate.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>Of old, the demagogue was also a general, and then democracies 
<A NAME="317"></A>changed into tyrannies. Most of the ancient tyrants were originally demagogues. 
<A NAME="318"></A>They are not so now, but they were then; and the reason is that they were 
<A NAME="319"></A>generals and not orators, for oratory had not yet come into fashion. Whereas 
<A NAME="320"></A>in our day, when the art of rhetoric has made such progress, the orators 
<A NAME="321"></A>lead the people, but their ignorance of military matters prevents them 
<A NAME="322"></A>from usurping power; at any rate instances to the contrary are few and 
<A NAME="323"></A>slight. Tyrannies were more common formerly than now, for this reason also, 
<A NAME="324"></A>that great power was placed in the hands of individuals; thus a tyranny 
<A NAME="325"></A>arose at Miletus out of the office of the Prytanis, who had supreme authority 
<A NAME="326"></A>in many important matters. Moreover, in those days, when cities were not 
<A NAME="327"></A>large, the people dwelt in the fields, busy at their work; and their chiefs, 
<A NAME="328"></A>if they possessed any military talent, seized the opportunity, and winning 
<A NAME="329"></A>the confidence of the masses by professing their hatred of the wealthy, 
<A NAME="330"></A>they succeeded in obtaining the tyranny. Thus at Athens Peisistratus led 
<A NAME="331"></A>a faction against the men of the plain, and Theagenes at Megara slaughtered 
<A NAME="332"></A>the cattle of the wealthy, which he found by the river side, where they 
<A NAME="333"></A>had put them to graze in land not their own. Dionysius, again, was thought 
<A NAME="334"></A>worthy of the tyranny because he denounced Daphnaeus and the rich; his 
<A NAME="335"></A>enmity to the notables won for him the confidence of the people. Changes 
<A NAME="336"></A>also take place from the ancient to the latest form of democracy; for where 
<A NAME="337"></A>there is a popular election of the magistrates and no property qualification, 
<A NAME="338"></A>the aspirants for office get hold of the people, and contrive at last even 
<A NAME="339"></A>to set them above the laws. A more or less complete cure for this state 
<A NAME="340"></A>of things is for the separate tribes, and not the whole people, to elect 
<A NAME="341"></A>the magistrates.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>These are the principal causes of revolutions in 
<A NAME="343"></A>democracies.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="344"></A><B>Part VI</B>

<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>There are two patent causes of revolutions in oligarchies: (1) 
<A NAME="346"></A>First, when the oligarchs oppress the people, for then anybody is good 
<A NAME="347"></A>enough to be their champion, especially if he be himself a member of the 
<A NAME="348"></A>oligarchy, as Lygdamis at Naxos, who afterwards came to be tyrant. But 
<A NAME="349"></A>revolutions which commence outside the governing class may be further subdivided. 
<A NAME="350"></A>Sometimes, when the government is very exclusive, the revolution is brought 
<A NAME="351"></A>about by persons of the wealthy class who are excluded, as happened at 
<A NAME="352"></A>Massalia and Istros and Heraclea, and other cities. Those who had no share 
<A NAME="353"></A>in the government created a disturbance, until first the elder brothers, 
<A NAME="354"></A>and then the younger, were admitted; for in some places father and son, 
<A NAME="355"></A>in others elder and younger brothers, do not hold office together. At Massalia 
<A NAME="356"></A>the oligarchy became more like a constitutional government, but at Istros 
<A NAME="357"></A>ended in a democracy, and at Heraclea was enlarged to 600. At Cnidos, again, 
<A NAME="358"></A>the oligarchy underwent a considerable change. For the notables fell out 
<A NAME="359"></A>among themselves, because only a few shared in the government; there existed 
<A NAME="360"></A>among them the rule already mentioned, that father and son not hold office 
<A NAME="361"></A>together, and, if there were several brothers, only the eldest was admitted. 
<A NAME="362"></A>The people took advantage of the quarrel, and choosing one of the notables 
<A NAME="363"></A>to be their leader, attacked and conquered the oligarchs, who were divided, 
<A NAME="364"></A>and division is always a source of weakness. The city of Erythrae, too, 
<A NAME="365"></A>in old times was ruled, and ruled well, by the Basilidae, but the people 
<A NAME="366"></A>took offense at the narrowness of the oligarchy and changed the 
<A NAME="367"></A>constitution.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>(2) Of internal causes of revolutions in oligarchies one is the 
<A NAME="369"></A>personal rivalry of the oligarchs, which leads them to play the demagogue. 
<A NAME="370"></A>Now, the oligarchical demagogue is of two sorts: either (a) he practices 
<A NAME="371"></A>upon the oligarchs themselves (for, although the oligarchy are quite a 
<A NAME="372"></A>small number, there may be a demagogue among them, as at Athens Charicles' 
<A NAME="373"></A>party won power by courting the Thirty, that of Phrynichus by courting 
<A NAME="374"></A>the Four Hundred); or (b) the oligarchs may play the demagogue with the 
<A NAME="375"></A>people. This was the case at Larissa, where the guardians of the citizens 
<A NAME="376"></A>endeavored to gain over the people because they were elected by them; and 
<A NAME="377"></A>such is the fate of all oligarchies in which the magistrates are elected, 
<A NAME="378"></A>as at Abydos, not by the class to which they belong, but by the heavy-armed 
<A NAME="379"></A>or by the people, although they may be required to have a high qualification, 
<A NAME="380"></A>or to be members of a political club; or, again, where the law-courts are 
<A NAME="381"></A>composed of persons outside the government, the oligarchs flatter the people 
<A NAME="382"></A>in order to obtain a decision in their own favor, and so they change the 
<A NAME="383"></A>constitution; this happened at Heraclea in Pontus. Again, oligarchies change 
<A NAME="384"></A>whenever any attempt is made to narrow them; for then those who desire 
<A NAME="385"></A>equal rights are compelled to call in the people. Changes in the oligarchy 
<A NAME="386"></A>also occur when the oligarchs waste their private property by extravagant 
<A NAME="387"></A>living; for then they want to innovate, and either try to make themselves 
<A NAME="388"></A>tyrants, or install some one else in the tyranny, as Hipparinus did Dionysius 
<A NAME="389"></A>at Syracuse, and as at Amphipolis a man named Cleotimus introduced Chalcidian 
<A NAME="390"></A>colonists, and when they arrived, stirred them up against the rich. For 
<A NAME="391"></A>a like reason in Aegina the person who carried on the negotiation with 
<A NAME="392"></A>Chares endeavored to revolutionize the state. Sometimes a party among the 
<A NAME="393"></A>oligarchs try directly to create a political change; sometimes they rob 
<A NAME="394"></A>the treasury, and then either the thieves or, as happened at Apollonia 
<A NAME="395"></A>in Pontus, those who resist them in their thieving quarrel with the rulers. 
<A NAME="396"></A>But an oligarchy which is at unity with itself is not easily destroyed 
<A NAME="397"></A>from within; of this we may see an example at Pharsalus, for there, although 
<A NAME="398"></A>the rulers are few in number, they govern a large city, because they have 
<A NAME="399"></A>a good understanding among themselves.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>Oligarchies, again, are overthrown when another oligarchy is created 
<A NAME="401"></A>within the original one, that is to say, when the whole governing body 
<A NAME="402"></A>is small and yet they do not all share in the highest offices. Thus at 
<A NAME="403"></A>Elis the governing body was a small senate; and very few ever found their 
<A NAME="404"></A>way into it, because the senators were only ninety in number, and were 
<A NAME="405"></A>elected for life and out of certain families in a manner similar to the 
<A NAME="406"></A>Lacedaemonian elders. Oligarchy is liable to revolutions alike in war and 
<A NAME="407"></A>in peace; in war because, not being able to trust the people, the oligarchs 
<A NAME="408"></A>are compelled to hire mercenaries, and the general who is in command of 
<A NAME="409"></A>them often ends in becoming a tyrant, as Timophanes did at Corinth; or 
<A NAME="410"></A>if there are more generals than one they make themselves into a company 
<A NAME="411"></A>of tyrants. Sometimes the oligarchs, fearing this danger, give the people 
<A NAME="412"></A>a share in the government because their services are necessary to them. 
<A NAME="413"></A>And in time of peace, from mutual distrust, the two parties hand over the 
<A NAME="414"></A>defense of the state to the army and to an arbiter between the two factions, 
<A NAME="415"></A>who often ends the master of both. This happened at Larissa when Simos 
<A NAME="416"></A>the Aleuad had the government, and at Abydos in the days of Iphiades and 
<A NAME="417"></A>the political clubs. Revolutions also arise out of marriages or lawsuits 
<A NAME="418"></A>which lead to the overthrow of one party among the oligarchs by another. 
<A NAME="419"></A>Of quarrels about marriages I have already mentioned some instances; another 
<A NAME="420"></A>occurred at Eretria, where Diagoras overturned the oligarchy of the knights 
<A NAME="421"></A>because he had been wronged about a marriage. A revolution at Heraclea, 
<A NAME="422"></A>and another at Thebes, both arose out of decisions of law-courts upon a 
<A NAME="423"></A>charge of adultery; in both cases the punishment was just, but executed 
<A NAME="424"></A>in the spirit of party, at Heraclea upon Eurytion, and at Thebes upon Archias; 
<A NAME="425"></A>for their enemies were jealous of them and so had them pilloried in the 
<A NAME="426"></A>agora. Many oligarchies have been destroyed by some members of the ruling 
<A NAME="427"></A>class taking offense at their excessive despotism; for example, the oligarchy 
<A NAME="428"></A>at Cnidus and at Chios.
<A NAME="429"></A><BR><BR>Changes of constitutional governments, and also of oligarchies 
<A NAME="430"></A>which limit the office of counselor, judge, or other magistrate to persons 
<A NAME="431"></A>having a certain money qualification, often occur by accident. The qualification 
<A NAME="432"></A>may have been originally fixed according to the circumstances of the time, 
<A NAME="433"></A>in such a manner as to include in an oligarchy a few only, or in a constitutional 
<A NAME="434"></A>government the middle class. But after a time of prosperity, whether arising 
<A NAME="435"></A>from peace or some other good fortune, the same property becomes many times 
<A NAME="436"></A>as valuable, and then everybody participates in every office; this happens 
<A NAME="437"></A>sometimes gradually and insensibly, and sometimes quickly. These are the 
<A NAME="438"></A>causes of changes and revolutions in oligarchies.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>We must remark generally both of democracies and oligarchies, that 
<A NAME="440"></A>they sometimes change, not into the opposite forms of government, but only 
<A NAME="441"></A>into another variety of the same class; I mean to say, from those forms 
<A NAME="442"></A>of democracy and oligarchy which are regulated by law into those which 
<A NAME="443"></A>are arbitrary, and conversely.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="444"></A><B>Part VII</B>

<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR>In aristocracies revolutions are stirred up when a few only share 
<A NAME="446"></A>in the honors of the state; a cause which has been already shown to affect 
<A NAME="447"></A>oligarchies; for an aristocracy is a sort of oligarchy, and, like an oligarchy, 
<A NAME="448"></A>is the government of a few, although few not for the same reason; hence 
<A NAME="449"></A>the two are often confounded. And revolutions will be most likely to happen, 
<A NAME="450"></A>and must happen, when the mass of the people are of the high-spirited kind, 
<A NAME="451"></A>and have a notion that they are as good as their rulers. Thus at Lacedaemon 
<A NAME="452"></A>the so-called Partheniae, who were the [illegitimate] sons of the Spartan 
<A NAME="453"></A>peers, attempted a revolution, and, being detected, were sent away to colonize 
<A NAME="454"></A>Tarentum. Again, revolutions occur when great men who are at least of equal 
<A NAME="455"></A>merit are dishonored by those higher in office, as Lysander was by the 
<A NAME="456"></A>kings of Sparta; or, when a brave man is excluded from the honors of the 
<A NAME="457"></A>state, like Cinadon, who conspired against the Spartans in the reign of 
<A NAME="458"></A>Agesilaus; or, again, when some are very poor and others very rich, a state 
<A NAME="459"></A>of society which is most often the result of war, as at Lacedaemon in the 
<A NAME="460"></A>days of the Messenian War; this is proved from the poem of Tyrtaeus, entitled 
<A NAME="461"></A>'Good Order'; for he speaks of certain citizens who were ruined by the 
<A NAME="462"></A>war and wanted to have a redistribution of the land. Again, revolutions 
<A NAME="463"></A>arise when an individual who is great, and might be greater, wants to rule 
<A NAME="464"></A>alone, as, at Lacedaemon, Pausanias, who was general in the Persian War, 
<A NAME="465"></A>or like Hanno at Carthage.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR>Constitutional governments and aristocracies are commonly overthrown 
<A NAME="467"></A>owing to some deviation from justice in the constitution itself; the cause 
<A NAME="468"></A>of the downfall is, in the former, the ill-mingling of the two elements, 
<A NAME="469"></A>democracy and oligarchy; in the latter, of the three elements, democracy, 
<A NAME="470"></A>oligarchy, and virtue, but especially democracy and oligarchy. For to combine 
<A NAME="471"></A>these is the endeavor of constitutional governments; and most of the so-called 
<A NAME="472"></A>aristocracies have a like aim, but differ from polities in the mode of 
<A NAME="473"></A>combination; hence some of them are more and some less permanent. Those 
<A NAME="474"></A>which incline more to oligarchy are called aristocracies, and those which 
<A NAME="475"></A>incline to democracy constitutional governments. And therefore the latter 
<A NAME="476"></A>are the safer of the two; for the greater the number, the greater the strength, 
<A NAME="477"></A>and when men are equal they are contented. But the rich, if the constitution 
<A NAME="478"></A>gives them power, are apt to be insolent and avaricious; and, in general, 
<A NAME="479"></A>whichever way the constitution inclines, in that direction it changes as 
<A NAME="480"></A>either party gains strength, a constitutional government becoming a democracy, 
<A NAME="481"></A>an aristocracy an oligarchy. But the process may be reversed, and aristocracy 
<A NAME="482"></A>may change into democracy. This happens when the poor, under the idea that 
<A NAME="483"></A>they are being wronged, force the constitution to take an opposite form. 
<A NAME="484"></A>In like manner constitutional governments change into oligarchies. The 
<A NAME="485"></A>only stable principle of government is equality according to proportion, 
<A NAME="486"></A>and for every man to enjoy his own.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>What I have just mentioned actually happened at Thurii, where the 
<A NAME="488"></A>qualification for office, at first high, was therefore reduced, and the 
<A NAME="489"></A>magistrates increased in number. The notables had previously acquired the 
<A NAME="490"></A>whole of the land contrary to law; for the government tended to oligarchy, 
<A NAME="491"></A>and they were able to encroach.... But the people, who had been trained 
<A NAME="492"></A>by war, soon got the better of the guards kept by the oligarchs, until 
<A NAME="493"></A>those who had too much gave up their land.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR>Again, since all aristocratical governments incline to oligarchy, 
<A NAME="495"></A>the notables are apt to be grasping; thus at Lacedaemon, where property 
<A NAME="496"></A>tends to pass into few hands, the notables can do too much as they like, 
<A NAME="497"></A>and are allowed to marry whom they please. The city of Locri was ruined 
<A NAME="498"></A>by a marriage connection with Dionysius, but such a thing could never have 
<A NAME="499"></A>happened in a democracy, or in a wellbalanced aristocracy.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>I have already remarked that in all states revolutions are occasioned 
<A NAME="501"></A>by trifles. In aristocracies, above all, they are of a gradual and imperceptible 
<A NAME="502"></A>nature. The citizens begin by giving up some part of the constitution, 
<A NAME="503"></A>and so with greater ease the government change something else which is 
<A NAME="504"></A>a little more important, until they have undermined the whole fabric of 
<A NAME="505"></A>the state. At Thurii there was a law that generals should only be re-elected 
<A NAME="506"></A>after an interval of five years, and some young men who were popular with 
<A NAME="507"></A>the soldiers of the guard for their military prowess, despising the magistrates 
<A NAME="508"></A>and thinking that they would easily gain their purpose, wanted to abolish 
<A NAME="509"></A>this law and allow their generals to hold perpetual commands; for they 
<A NAME="510"></A>well knew that the people would be glad enough to elect them. Whereupon 
<A NAME="511"></A>the magistrates who had charge of these matters, and who are called councillors, 
<A NAME="512"></A>at first determined to resist, but they afterwards consented, thinking 
<A NAME="513"></A>that, if only this one law was changed, no further inroad would be made 
<A NAME="514"></A>on the constitution. But other changes soon followed which they in vain 
<A NAME="515"></A>attempted to oppose; and the state passed into the hands of the revolutionists, 
<A NAME="516"></A>who established a dynastic oligarchy.
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>All constitutions are overthrown either from within or from without; 
<A NAME="518"></A>the latter, when there is some government close at hand having an opposite 
<A NAME="519"></A>interest, or at a distance, but powerful. This was exemplified in the old 
<A NAME="520"></A>times of the Athenians and the Lacedaemonians; the Athenians everywhere 
<A NAME="521"></A>put down the oligarchies, and the Lacedaemonians the 
<A NAME="522"></A>democracies.
<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>I have now explained what are the chief causes of revolutions and 
<A NAME="524"></A>dissensions in states.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="525"></A><B>Part VIII</B>

<A NAME="526"></A><BR><BR>We have next to consider what means there are of preserving constitutions 
<A NAME="527"></A>in general, and in particular cases. In the first place it is evident that 
<A NAME="528"></A>if we know the causes which destroy constitutions, we also know the causes 
<A NAME="529"></A>which preserve them; for opposites produce opposites, and destruction is 
<A NAME="530"></A>the opposite of preservation.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>In all well-attempered governments there is nothing which should 
<A NAME="532"></A>be more jealously maintained than the spirit of obedience to law, more 
<A NAME="533"></A>especially in small matters; for transgression creeps in unperceived and 
<A NAME="534"></A>at last ruins the state, just as the constant recurrence of small expenses 
<A NAME="535"></A>in time eats up a fortune. The expense does not take place at once, and 
<A NAME="536"></A>therefore is not observed; the mind is deceived, as in the fallacy which 
<A NAME="537"></A>says that 'if each part is little, then the whole is little.' this is true 
<A NAME="538"></A>in one way, but not in another, for the whole and the all are not little, 
<A NAME="539"></A>although they are made up of littles.
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>In the first place, then, men should guard against the beginning 
<A NAME="541"></A>of change, and in the second place they should not rely upon the political 
<A NAME="542"></A>devices of which I have already spoken invented only to deceive the people, 
<A NAME="543"></A>for they are proved by experience to be useless. Further, we note that 
<A NAME="544"></A>oligarchies as well as aristocracies may last, not from any inherent stability 
<A NAME="545"></A>in such forms of government, but because the rulers are on good terms both 
<A NAME="546"></A>with the unenfranchised and with the governing classes, not maltreating 
<A NAME="547"></A>any who are excluded from the government, but introducing into it the leading 
<A NAME="548"></A>spirits among them. They should never wrong the ambitious in a matter of 
<A NAME="549"></A>honor, or the common people in a matter of money; and they should treat 
<A NAME="550"></A>one another and their fellow citizen in a spirit of equality. The equality 
<A NAME="551"></A>which the friends of democracy seek to establish for the multitude is not 
<A NAME="552"></A>only just but likewise expedient among equals. Hence, if the governing 
<A NAME="553"></A>class are numerous, many democratic institutions are useful; for example, 
<A NAME="554"></A>the restriction of the tenure of offices to six months, that all those 
<A NAME="555"></A>who are of equal rank may share in them. Indeed, equals or peers when they 
<A NAME="556"></A>are numerous become a kind of democracy, and therefore demagogues are very 
<A NAME="557"></A>likely to arise among them, as I have already remarked. The short tenure 
<A NAME="558"></A>of office prevents oligarchies and aristocracies from falling into the 
<A NAME="559"></A>hands of families; it is not easy for a person to do any great harm when 
<A NAME="560"></A>his tenure of office is short, whereas long possession begets tyranny in 
<A NAME="561"></A>oligarchies and democracies. For the aspirants to tyranny are either the 
<A NAME="562"></A>principal men of the state, who in democracies are demagogues and in oligarchies 
<A NAME="563"></A>members of ruling houses, or those who hold great offices, and have a long 
<A NAME="564"></A>tenure of them.
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR>Constitutions are preserved when their destroyers are at a distance, 
<A NAME="566"></A>and sometimes also because they are near, for the fear of them makes the 
<A NAME="567"></A>government keep in hand the constitution. Wherefore the ruler who has a 
<A NAME="568"></A>care of the constitution should invent terrors, and bring distant dangers 
<A NAME="569"></A>near, in order that the citizens may be on their guard, and, like sentinels 
<A NAME="570"></A>in a night watch, never relax their attention. He should endeavor too by 
<A NAME="571"></A>help of the laws to control the contentions and quarrels of the notables, 
<A NAME="572"></A>and to prevent those who have not hitherto taken part in them from catching 
<A NAME="573"></A>the spirit of contention. No ordinary man can discern the beginning of 
<A NAME="574"></A>evil, but only the true statesman.
<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR>As to the change produced in oligarchies and constitutional governments 
<A NAME="576"></A>by the alteration of the qualification, when this arises, not out of any 
<A NAME="577"></A>variation in the qualification but only out of the increase of money, it 
<A NAME="578"></A>is well to compare the general valuation of property with that of past 
<A NAME="579"></A>years, annually in those cities in which the census is taken annually and 
<A NAME="580"></A>in larger cities every third or fifth year. If the whole is many times 
<A NAME="581"></A>greater or many times less than when the ratings recognized by the constitution 
<A NAME="582"></A>were fixed, there should be power given by law to raise or lower the qualification 
<A NAME="583"></A>as the amount is greater or less. Where this is not done a constitutional 
<A NAME="584"></A>government passes into an oligarchy, and an oligarchy is narrowed to a 
<A NAME="585"></A>rule of families; or in the opposite case constitutional government becomes 
<A NAME="586"></A>democracy, and oligarchy either constitutional government or 
<A NAME="587"></A>democracy.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR>It is a principle common to democracy, oligarchy, and every other 
<A NAME="589"></A>form of government not to allow the disproportionate increase of any citizen 
<A NAME="590"></A>but to give moderate honor for a long time rather than great honor for 
<A NAME="591"></A>a short time. For men are easily spoilt; not every one can bear prosperity. 
<A NAME="592"></A>But if this rule is not observed, at any rate the honors which are given 
<A NAME="593"></A>all at once should be taken away by degrees and not all at once. Especially 
<A NAME="594"></A>should the laws provide against any one having too much power, whether 
<A NAME="595"></A>derived from friends or money; if he has, he should be sent clean out of 
<A NAME="596"></A>the country. And since innovations creep in through the private life of 
<A NAME="597"></A>individuals also, there ought to be a magistracy which will have an eye 
<A NAME="598"></A>to those whose life is not in harmony with the government, whether oligarchy 
<A NAME="599"></A>or democracy or any other. And for a like reason an increase of prosperity 
<A NAME="600"></A>in any part of the state should be carefully watched. The proper remedy 
<A NAME="601"></A>for this evil is always to give the management of affairs and offices of 
<A NAME="602"></A>state to opposite elements; such opposites are the virtuous and the many, 
<A NAME="603"></A>or the rich and the poor. Another way is to combine the poor and the rich 
<A NAME="604"></A>in one body, or to increase the middle class: thus an end will be put to 
<A NAME="605"></A>the revolutions which arise from inequality.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR>But above all every state should be so administered and so regulated 
<A NAME="607"></A>by law that its magistrates cannot possibly make money. In oligarchies 
<A NAME="608"></A>special precautions should be used against this evil. For the people do 
<A NAME="609"></A>not take any great offense at being kept out of the government- indeed 
<A NAME="610"></A>they are rather pleased than otherwise at having leisure for their private 
<A NAME="611"></A>business- but what irritates them is to think that their rulers are stealing 
<A NAME="612"></A>the public money; then they are doubly annoyed; for they lose both honor 
<A NAME="613"></A>and profit. If office brought no profit, then and then only could democracy 
<A NAME="614"></A>and aristocracy be combined; for both notables and people might have their 
<A NAME="615"></A>wishes gratified. All would be able to hold office, which is the aim of 
<A NAME="616"></A>democracy, and the notables would be magistrates, which is the aim of aristocracy. 
<A NAME="617"></A>And this result may be accomplished when there is no possibility of making 
<A NAME="618"></A>money out of the offices; for the poor will not want to have them when 
<A NAME="619"></A>there is nothing to be gained from them- they would rather be attending 
<A NAME="620"></A>to their own concerns; and the rich, who do not want money from the public 
<A NAME="621"></A>treasury, will be able to take them; and so the poor will keep to their 
<A NAME="622"></A>work and grow rich, and the notables will not be governed by the lower 
<A NAME="623"></A>class. In order to avoid peculation of the public money, the transfer of 
<A NAME="624"></A>the revenue should be made at a general assembly of the citizens, and duplicates 
<A NAME="625"></A>of the accounts deposited with the different brotherhoods, companies, and 
<A NAME="626"></A>tribes. And honors should be given by law to magistrates who have the reputation 
<A NAME="627"></A>of being incorruptible. In democracies the rich should be spared; not only 
<A NAME="628"></A>should their property not be divided, but their incomes also, which in 
<A NAME="629"></A>some states are taken from them imperceptibly, should be protected. It 
<A NAME="630"></A>is a good thing to prevent the wealthy citizens, even if they are willing 
<A NAME="631"></A>from undertaking expensive and useless public services, such as the giving 
<A NAME="632"></A>of choruses, torch-races, and the like. In an oligarchy, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="633"></A>great care should be taken of the poor, and lucrative offices should go 
<A NAME="634"></A>to them; if any of the wealthy classes insult them, the offender should 
<A NAME="635"></A>be punished more severely than if he had wronged one of his own class. 
<A NAME="636"></A>Provision should be made that estates pass by inheritance and not by gift, 
<A NAME="637"></A>and no person should have more than one inheritance; for in this way properties 
<A NAME="638"></A>will be equalized, and more of the poor rise to competency. It is also 
<A NAME="639"></A>expedient both in a democracy and in an oligarchy to assign to those who 
<A NAME="640"></A>have less share in the government (i.e., to the rich in a democracy and 
<A NAME="641"></A>to the poor in an oligarchy) an equality or preference in all but the principal 
<A NAME="642"></A>offices of state. The latter should be entrusted chiefly or only to members 
<A NAME="643"></A>of the governing class.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="644"></A><B>Part IX</B>

<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR>There are three qualifications required in those who have to fill 
<A NAME="646"></A>the highest offices- (1) first of all, loyalty to the established constitution; 
<A NAME="647"></A>(2) the greatest administrative capacity; (3) virtue and justice of the 
<A NAME="648"></A>kind proper to each form of government; for, if what is just is not the 
<A NAME="649"></A>same in all governments, the quality of justice must also differ. There 
<A NAME="650"></A>may be a doubt, however, when all these qualities do not meet in the same 
<A NAME="651"></A>person, how the selection is to be made; suppose, for example, a good general 
<A NAME="652"></A>is a bad man and not a friend to the constitution, and another man is loyal 
<A NAME="653"></A>and just, which should we choose? In making the election ought we not to 
<A NAME="654"></A>consider two points? what qualities are common, and what are rare. Thus 
<A NAME="655"></A>in the choice of a general, we should regard his skill rather than his 
<A NAME="656"></A>virtue; for few have military skill, but many have virtue. In any office 
<A NAME="657"></A>of trust or stewardship, on the other hand, the opposite rule should be 
<A NAME="658"></A>observed; for more virtue than ordinary is required in the holder of such 
<A NAME="659"></A>an office, but the necessary knowledge is of a sort which all men 
<A NAME="660"></A>possess.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR>It may, however, be asked what a man wants with virtue if he have 
<A NAME="662"></A>political ability and is loyal, since these two qualities alone will make 
<A NAME="663"></A>him do what is for the public interest. But may not men have both of them 
<A NAME="664"></A>and yet be deficient in self-control? If, knowing and loving their own 
<A NAME="665"></A>interests, they do not always attend to them, may they not be equally negligent 
<A NAME="666"></A>of the interests of the public?
<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>Speaking generally, we may say that whatever legal enactments are 
<A NAME="668"></A>held to be for the interest of various constitutions, all these preserve 
<A NAME="669"></A>them. And the great preserving principle is the one which has been repeatedly 
<A NAME="670"></A>mentioned- to have a care that the loyal citizen should be stronger than 
<A NAME="671"></A>the disloyal. Neither should we forget the mean, which at the present day 
<A NAME="672"></A>is lost sight of in perverted forms of government; for many practices which 
<A NAME="673"></A>appear to be democratical are the ruin of democracies, and many which appear 
<A NAME="674"></A>to be oligarchical are the ruin of oligarchies. Those who think that all 
<A NAME="675"></A>virtue is to be found in their own party principles push matters to extremes; 
<A NAME="676"></A>they do not consider that disproportion destroys a state. A nose which 
<A NAME="677"></A>varies from the ideal of straightness to a hook or snub may still be of 
<A NAME="678"></A>good shape and agreeable to the eye; but if the excess be very great, all 
<A NAME="679"></A>symmetry is lost, and the nose at last ceases to be a nose at all on account 
<A NAME="680"></A>of some excess in one direction or defect in the other; and this is true 
<A NAME="681"></A>of every other part of the human body. The same law of proportion equally 
<A NAME="682"></A>holds in states. Oligarchy or democracy, although a departure from the 
<A NAME="683"></A>most perfect form, may yet be a good enough government, but if any one 
<A NAME="684"></A>attempts to push the principles of either to an extreme, he will begin 
<A NAME="685"></A>by spoiling the government and end by having none at all. Wherefore the 
<A NAME="686"></A>legislator and the statesman ought to know what democratical measures save 
<A NAME="687"></A>and what destroy a democracy, and what oligarchical measures save or destroy 
<A NAME="688"></A>an oligarchy. For neither the one nor the other can exist or continue to 
<A NAME="689"></A>exist unless both rich and poor are included in it. If equality of property 
<A NAME="690"></A>is introduced, the state must of necessity take another form; for when 
<A NAME="691"></A>by laws carried to excess one or other element in the state is ruined, 
<A NAME="692"></A>the constitution is ruined.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR><BR>There is an error common both to oligarchies and to democracies: 
<A NAME="694"></A>in the latter the demagogues, when the multitude are above the law, are 
<A NAME="695"></A>always cutting the city in two by quarrels with the rich, whereas they 
<A NAME="696"></A>should always profess to be maintaining their cause; just as in oligarchies 
<A NAME="697"></A>the oligarchs should profess to maintaining the cause of the people, and 
<A NAME="698"></A>should take oaths the opposite of those which they now take. For there 
<A NAME="699"></A>are cities in which they swear- 'I will be an enemy to the people, and 
<A NAME="700"></A>will devise all the harm against them which I can'; but they ought to exhibit 
<A NAME="701"></A>and to entertain the very opposite feeling; in the form of their oath there 
<A NAME="702"></A>should be an express declaration- 'I will do no wrong to the 
<A NAME="703"></A>people.'
<A NAME="704"></A><BR><BR>But of all the things which I have mentioned that which most contributes 
<A NAME="705"></A>to the permanence of constitutions is the adaptation of education to the 
<A NAME="706"></A>form of government, and yet in our own day this principle is universally 
<A NAME="707"></A>neglected. The best laws, though sanctioned by every citizen of the state, 
<A NAME="708"></A>will be of no avail unless the young are trained by habit and education 
<A NAME="709"></A>in the spirit of the constitution, if the laws are democratical, democratically 
<A NAME="710"></A>or oligarchically, if the laws are oligarchical. For there may be a want 
<A NAME="711"></A>of self-discipline in states as well as in individuals. Now, to have been 
<A NAME="712"></A>educated in the spirit of the constitution is not to perform the actions 
<A NAME="713"></A>in which oligarchs or democrats delight, but those by which the existence 
<A NAME="714"></A>of an oligarchy or of a democracy is made possible. Whereas among ourselves 
<A NAME="715"></A>the sons of the ruling class in an oligarchy live in luxury, but the sons 
<A NAME="716"></A>of the poor are hardened by exercise and toil, and hence they are both 
<A NAME="717"></A>more inclined and better able to make a revolution. And in democracies 
<A NAME="718"></A>of the more extreme type there has arisen a false idea of freedom which 
<A NAME="719"></A>is contradictory to the true interests of the state. For two principles 
<A NAME="720"></A>are characteristic of democracy, the government of the majority and freedom. 
<A NAME="721"></A>Men think that what is just is equal; and that equality is the supremacy 
<A NAME="722"></A>of the popular will; and that freedom means the doing what a man likes. 
<A NAME="723"></A>In such democracies every one lives as he pleases, or in the words of Euripides, 
<A NAME="724"></A>'according to his fancy.' But this is all wrong; men should not think it 
<A NAME="725"></A>slavery to live according to the rule of the constitution; for it is their 
<A NAME="726"></A>salvation.
<A NAME="727"></A><BR><BR>I have now discussed generally the causes of the revolution and 
<A NAME="728"></A>destruction of states, and the means of their preservation and 
<A NAME="729"></A>continuance.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="730"></A><B>Part X</B>

<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>I have still to speak of monarchy, and the causes of its destruction 
<A NAME="732"></A>and preservation. What I have said already respecting forms of constitutional 
<A NAME="733"></A>government applies almost equally to royal and to tyrannical rule. For 
<A NAME="734"></A>royal rule is of the nature of an aristocracy, and a tyranny is a compound 
<A NAME="735"></A>of oligarchy and democracy in their most extreme forms; it is therefore 
<A NAME="736"></A>most injurious to its subjects, being made up of two evil forms of government, 
<A NAME="737"></A>and having the perversions and errors of both. These two forms of monarchy 
<A NAME="738"></A>are contrary in their very origin. The appointment of a king is the resource 
<A NAME="739"></A>of the better classes against the people, and he is elected by them out 
<A NAME="740"></A>of their own number, because either he himself or his family excel in virtue 
<A NAME="741"></A>and virtuous actions; whereas a tyrant is chosen from the people to be 
<A NAME="742"></A>their protector against the notables, and in order to prevent them from 
<A NAME="743"></A>being injured. History shows that almost all tyrants have been demagogues 
<A NAME="744"></A>who gained the favor of the people by their accusation of the notables. 
<A NAME="745"></A>At any rate this was the manner in which the tyrannies arose in the days 
<A NAME="746"></A>when cities had increased in power. Others which were older originated 
<A NAME="747"></A>in the ambition of kings wanting to overstep the limits of their hereditary 
<A NAME="748"></A>power and become despots. Others again grew out of the class which were 
<A NAME="749"></A>chosen to be chief magistrates; for in ancient times the people who elected 
<A NAME="750"></A>them gave the magistrates, whether civil or religious, a long tenure. Others 
<A NAME="751"></A>arose out of the custom which oligarchies had of making some individual 
<A NAME="752"></A>supreme over the highest offices. In any of these ways an ambitious man 
<A NAME="753"></A>had no difficulty, if he desired, in creating a tyranny, since he had the 
<A NAME="754"></A>power in his hands already, either as king or as one of the officers of 
<A NAME="755"></A>state. Thus Pheidon at Argos and several others were originally kings, 
<A NAME="756"></A>and ended by becoming tyrants; Phalaris, on the other hand, and the Ionian 
<A NAME="757"></A>tyrants, acquired the tyranny by holding great offices. Whereas Panaetius 
<A NAME="758"></A>at Leontini, Cypselus at Corinth, Peisistratus at Athens, Dionysius at 
<A NAME="759"></A>Syracuse, and several others who afterwards became tyrants, were at first 
<A NAME="760"></A>demagogues.
<A NAME="761"></A><BR><BR>And so, as I was saying, royalty ranks with aristocracy, for it 
<A NAME="762"></A>is based upon merit, whether of the individual or of his family, or on 
<A NAME="763"></A>benefits conferred, or on these claims with power added to them. For all 
<A NAME="764"></A>who have obtained this honor have benefited, or had in their power to benefit, 
<A NAME="765"></A>states and nations; some, like Codrus, have prevented the state from being 
<A NAME="766"></A>enslaved in war; others, like Cyrus, have given their country freedom, 
<A NAME="767"></A>or have settled or gained a territory, like the Lacedaemonian, Macedonian, 
<A NAME="768"></A>and Molossian kings. The idea of a king is to be a protector of the rich 
<A NAME="769"></A>against unjust treatment, of the people against insult and oppression. 
<A NAME="770"></A>Whereas a tyrant, as has often been repeated, has no regard to any public 
<A NAME="771"></A>interest, except as conducive to his private ends; his aim is pleasure, 
<A NAME="772"></A>the aim of a king, honor. Wherefore also in their desires they differ; 
<A NAME="773"></A>the tyrant is desirous of riches, the king, of what brings honor. And the 
<A NAME="774"></A>guards of a king are citizens, but of a tyrant mercenaries.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR><BR>That tyranny has all the vices both of democracy and oligarchy 
<A NAME="776"></A>is evident. As of oligarchy so of tyranny, the end is wealth; (for by wealth 
<A NAME="777"></A>only can the tyrant maintain either his guard or his luxury). Both mistrust 
<A NAME="778"></A>the people, and therefore deprive them of their arms. Both agree too in 
<A NAME="779"></A>injuring the people and driving them out of the city and dispersing them. 
<A NAME="780"></A>From democracy tyrants have borrowed the art of making war upon the notables 
<A NAME="781"></A>and destroying them secretly or openly, or of exiling them because they 
<A NAME="782"></A>are rivals and stand in the way of their power; and also because plots 
<A NAME="783"></A>against them are contrived by men of this dass, who either want to rule 
<A NAME="784"></A>or to escape subjection. Hence Periander advised Thrasybulus by cutting 
<A NAME="785"></A>off the tops of the tallest ears of corn, meaning that he must always put 
<A NAME="786"></A>out of the way the citizens who overtop the rest. And so, as I have already 
<A NAME="787"></A>intimated, the beginnings of change are the same in monarchies as in forms 
<A NAME="788"></A>of constitutional government; subjects attack their sovereigns out of fear 
<A NAME="789"></A>or contempt, or because they have been unjustly treated by them. And of 
<A NAME="790"></A>injustice, the most common form is insult, another is confiscation of 
<A NAME="791"></A>property.
<A NAME="792"></A><BR><BR>The ends sought by conspiracies against monarchies, whether tyrannies 
<A NAME="793"></A>or royalties, are the same as the ends sought by conspiracies against other 
<A NAME="794"></A>forms of government. Monarchs have great wealth and honor, which are objects 
<A NAME="795"></A>of desire to all mankind. The attacks are made sometimes against their 
<A NAME="796"></A>lives, sometimes against the office; where the sense of insult is the motive, 
<A NAME="797"></A>against their lives. Any sort of insult (and there are many) may stir up 
<A NAME="798"></A>anger, and when men are angry, they commonly act out of revenge, and not 
<A NAME="799"></A>from ambition. For example, the attempt made upon the Peisistratidae arose 
<A NAME="800"></A>out of the public dishonor offered to the sister of Harmodius and the insult 
<A NAME="801"></A>to himself. He attacked the tyrant for his sister's sake, and Aristogeiton 
<A NAME="802"></A>joined in the attack for the sake of Harmodius. A conspiracy was also formed 
<A NAME="803"></A>against Periander, the tyrant of Ambracia, because, when drinking with 
<A NAME="804"></A>a favorite youth, he asked him whether by this time he was not with child 
<A NAME="805"></A>by him. Philip, too, was attacked by Pausanias because he permitted him 
<A NAME="806"></A>to be insulted by Attalus and his friends, and Amyntas the little, by Derdas, 
<A NAME="807"></A>because he boasted of having enjoyed his youth. Evagoras of Cyprus, again, 
<A NAME="808"></A>was slain by the eunuch to revenge an insult; for his wife had been carried 
<A NAME="809"></A>off by Evagoras's son. Many conspiracies have originated in shameful attempts 
<A NAME="810"></A>made by sovereigns on the persons of their subjects. Such was the attack 
<A NAME="811"></A>of Crataeas upon Archelaus; he had always hated the connection with him, 
<A NAME="812"></A>and so, when Archelaus, having promised him one of his two daughters in 
<A NAME="813"></A>marriage, did not give him either of them, but broke his word and married 
<A NAME="814"></A>the elder to the king of Elymeia, when he was hard pressed in a war against 
<A NAME="815"></A>Sirrhas and Arrhabaeus, and the younger to his own son Amyntas, under the 
<A NAME="816"></A>idea that Amyntas would then be less likely to quarrel with his son by 
<A NAME="817"></A>Cleopatra- Crataeas made this slight a pretext for attacking Archelaus, 
<A NAME="818"></A>though even a less reason would have sufficed, for the real cause of the 
<A NAME="819"></A>estrangement was the disgust which he felt at his connection with the king. 
<A NAME="820"></A>And from a like motive Hellonocrates of Larissa conspired with him; for 
<A NAME="821"></A>when Archelaus, who was his lover, did not fulfill his promise of restoring 
<A NAME="822"></A>him to his country, he thought that the connection between them had originated, 
<A NAME="823"></A>not in affection, but in the wantonness of power. Pytho, too, and Heracleides 
<A NAME="824"></A>of Aenos, slew Cotys in order to avenge their father, and Adamas revolted 
<A NAME="825"></A>from Cotys in revenge for the wanton outrage which he had committed in 
<A NAME="826"></A>mutilating him when a child.
<A NAME="827"></A><BR><BR>Many, too, irritated at blows inflicted on the person which they 
<A NAME="828"></A>deemed an insult, have either killed or attempted to kill officers of state 
<A NAME="829"></A>and royal princes by whom they have been injured. Thus, at Mytilene, Megacles 
<A NAME="830"></A>and his friends attacked and slew the Penthilidae, as they were going about 
<A NAME="831"></A>and striking people with clubs. At a later date Smerdis, who had been beaten 
<A NAME="832"></A>and torn away from his wife by Penthilus, slew him. In the conspiracy against 
<A NAME="833"></A>Archelaus, Decamnichus stimulated the fury of the assassins and led the 
<A NAME="834"></A>attack; he was enraged because Archelaus had delivered him to Euripides 
<A NAME="835"></A>to be scourged; for the poet had been irritated at some remark made by 
<A NAME="836"></A>Decamnichus on the foulness of his breath. Many other examples might be 
<A NAME="837"></A>cited of murders and conspiracies which have arisen from similar 
<A NAME="838"></A>causes.
<A NAME="839"></A><BR><BR>Fear is another motive which, as we have said, has caused conspiracies 
<A NAME="840"></A>as well in monarchies as in more popular forms of government. Thus Artapanes 
<A NAME="841"></A>conspired against Xerxes and slew him, fearing that he would be accused 
<A NAME="842"></A>of hanging Darius against his orders-he having been under the impression 
<A NAME="843"></A>that Xerxes would forget what he had said in the middle of a meal, and 
<A NAME="844"></A>that the offense would be forgiven.
<A NAME="845"></A><BR><BR>Another motive is contempt, as in the case of Sardanapalus, whom 
<A NAME="846"></A>some one saw carding wool with his women, if the storytellers say truly; 
<A NAME="847"></A>and the tale may be true, if not of him, of some one else. Dion attacked 
<A NAME="848"></A>the younger Dionysius because he despised him, and saw that he was equally 
<A NAME="849"></A>despised by his own subjects, and that he was always drunk. Even the friends 
<A NAME="850"></A>of a tyrant will sometimes attack him out of contempt; for the confidence 
<A NAME="851"></A>which he reposes in them breeds contempt, and they think that they will 
<A NAME="852"></A>not be found out. The expectation of success is likewise a sort of contempt; 
<A NAME="853"></A>the assailants are ready to strike, and think nothing of the danger, because 
<A NAME="854"></A>they seem to have the power in their hands. Thus generals of armies attack 
<A NAME="855"></A>monarchs; as, for example, Cyrus attacked Astyages, despising the effeminacy 
<A NAME="856"></A>of his life, and believing that his power was worn out. Thus again, Seuthes 
<A NAME="857"></A>the Thracian conspired against Amadocus, whose general he 
<A NAME="858"></A>was.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR>And sometimes men are actuated by more than one motive, like Mithridates, 
<A NAME="860"></A>who conspired against Ariobarzanes, partly out of contempt and partly from 
<A NAME="861"></A>the love of gain.
<A NAME="862"></A><BR><BR>Bold natures, placed by their sovereigns in a high military position, 
<A NAME="863"></A>are most likely to make the attempt in the expectation of success; for 
<A NAME="864"></A>courage is emboldened by power, and the union of the two inspires them 
<A NAME="865"></A>with the hope of an easy victory.
<A NAME="866"></A><BR><BR>Attempts of which the motive is ambition arise in a different way 
<A NAME="867"></A>as well as in those already mentioned. There are men who will not risk 
<A NAME="868"></A>their lives in the hope of gains and honors however great, but who nevertheless 
<A NAME="869"></A>regard the killing of a tyrant simply as an extraordinary action which 
<A NAME="870"></A>will make them famous and honorable in the world; they wish to acquire, 
<A NAME="871"></A>not a kingdom, but a name. It is rare, however, to find such men; he who 
<A NAME="872"></A>would kill a tyrant must be prepared to lose his life if he fail. He must 
<A NAME="873"></A>have the resolution of Dion, who, when he made war upon Dionysius, took 
<A NAME="874"></A>with him very few troops, saying 'that whatever measure of success he might 
<A NAME="875"></A>attain would be enough for him, even if he were to die the moment he landed; 
<A NAME="876"></A>such a death would be welcome to him.' this is a temper to which few can 
<A NAME="877"></A>attain.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR>Once more, tyrannies, like all other governments, are destroyed 
<A NAME="879"></A>from without by some opposite and more powerful form of government. That 
<A NAME="880"></A>such a government will have the will to attack them is clear; for the two 
<A NAME="881"></A>are opposed in principle; and all men, if they can, do what they will. 
<A NAME="882"></A>Democracy is antagonistic to tyranny, on the principle of Hesiod, 'Potter 
<A NAME="883"></A>hates Potter,' because they are nearly akin, for the extreme form of democracy 
<A NAME="884"></A>is tyranny; and royalty and aristocracy are both alike opposed to tyranny, 
<A NAME="885"></A>because they are constitutions of a different type. And therefore the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="886"></A>put down most of the tyrannies, and so did the Syracusans during the time 
<A NAME="887"></A>when they were well governed.
<A NAME="888"></A><BR><BR>Again, tyrannies are destroyed from within, when the reigning family 
<A NAME="889"></A>are divided among themselves, as that of Gelo was, and more recently that 
<A NAME="890"></A>of Dionysius; in the case of Gelo because Thrasybulus, the brother of Hiero, 
<A NAME="891"></A>flattered the son of Gelo and led him into excesses in order that he might 
<A NAME="892"></A>rule in his name. Whereupon the family got together a party to get rid 
<A NAME="893"></A>of Thrasybulus and save the tyranny; but those of the people who conspired 
<A NAME="894"></A>with them seized the opportunity and drove them all out. In the case of 
<A NAME="895"></A>Dionysius, Dion, his own relative, attacked and expelled him with the assistance 
<A NAME="896"></A>of the people; he afterwards perished himself.
<A NAME="897"></A><BR><BR>There are two chief motives which induce men to attack tyrannies- 
<A NAME="898"></A>hatred and contempt. Hatred of tyrants is inevitable, and contempt is also 
<A NAME="899"></A>a frequent cause of their destruction. Thus we see that most of those who 
<A NAME="900"></A>have acquired, have retained their power, but those who have inherited, 
<A NAME="901"></A>have lost it, almost at once; for, living in luxurious ease, they have 
<A NAME="902"></A>become contemptible, and offer many opportunities to their assailants. 
<A NAME="903"></A>Anger, too, must be included under hatred, and produces the same effects. 
<A NAME="904"></A>It is often times even more ready to strike- the angry are more impetuous 
<A NAME="905"></A>in making an attack, for they do not follow rational principle. And men 
<A NAME="906"></A>are very apt to give way to their passions when they are insulted. To this 
<A NAME="907"></A>cause is to be attributed the fall of the Peisistratidae and of many others. 
<A NAME="908"></A>Hatred is more reasonable, for anger is accompanied by pain, which is an 
<A NAME="909"></A>impediment to reason, whereas hatred is painless.
<A NAME="910"></A><BR><BR>In a word, all the causes which I have mentioned as destroying 
<A NAME="911"></A>the last and most unmixed form of oligarchy, and the extreme form of democracy, 
<A NAME="912"></A>may be assumed to affect tyranny; indeed the extreme forms of both are 
<A NAME="913"></A>only tyrannies distributed among several persons. Kingly rule is little 
<A NAME="914"></A>affected by external causes, and is therefore lasting; it is generally 
<A NAME="915"></A>destroyed from within. And there are two ways in which the destruction 
<A NAME="916"></A>may come about; (1) when the members of the royal family quarrel among 
<A NAME="917"></A>themselves, and (2) when the kings attempt to administer the state too 
<A NAME="918"></A>much after the fashion of a tyranny, and to extend their authority contrary 
<A NAME="919"></A>to the law. Royalties do not now come into existence; where such forms 
<A NAME="920"></A>of government arise, they are rather monarchies or tyrannies. For the rule 
<A NAME="921"></A>of a king is over voluntary subjects, and he is supreme in all important 
<A NAME="922"></A>matters; but in our own day men are more upon an equality, and no one is 
<A NAME="923"></A>so immeasurably superior to others as to represent adequately the greatness 
<A NAME="924"></A>and dignity of the office. Hence mankind will not, if they can help, endure 
<A NAME="925"></A>it, and any one who obtains power by force or fraud is at once thought 
<A NAME="926"></A>to be a tyrant. In hereditary monarchies a further cause of destruction 
<A NAME="927"></A>is the fact that kings often fall into contempt, and, although possessing 
<A NAME="928"></A>not tyrannical power, but only royal dignity, are apt to outrage others. 
<A NAME="929"></A>Their overthrow is then readily effected; for there is an end to the king 
<A NAME="930"></A>when his subjects do not want to have him, but the tyrant lasts, whether 
<A NAME="931"></A>they like him or not.
<A NAME="932"></A><BR><BR>The destruction of monarchies is to be attributed to these and 
<A NAME="933"></A>the like causes.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="934"></A><B>Part XI</B>

<A NAME="935"></A><BR><BR>And they are preserved, to speak generally, by the opposite causes; 
<A NAME="936"></A>or, if we consider them separately, (1) royalty is preserved by the limitation 
<A NAME="937"></A>of its powers. The more restricted the functions of kings, the longer their 
<A NAME="938"></A>power will last unimpaired; for then they are more moderate and not so 
<A NAME="939"></A>despotic in their ways; and they are less envied by their subjects. This 
<A NAME="940"></A>is the reason why the kingly office has lasted so long among the Molossians. 
<A NAME="941"></A>And for a similar reason it has continued among the Lacedaemonians, because 
<A NAME="942"></A>there it was always divided between two, and afterwards further limited 
<A NAME="943"></A>by Theopompus in various respects, more particularly by the establishment 
<A NAME="944"></A>of the Ephoralty. He diminished the power of the kings, but established 
<A NAME="945"></A>on a more lasting basis the kingly office, which was thus made in a certain 
<A NAME="946"></A>sense not less, but greater. There is a story that when his wife once asked 
<A NAME="947"></A>him whether he was not ashamed to leave to his sons a royal power which 
<A NAME="948"></A>was less than he had inherited from his father, 'No indeed,' he replied, 
<A NAME="949"></A>'for the power which I leave to them will be more lasting.'
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><BR>As to (2) tyrannies, they are preserved in two most opposite ways. 
<A NAME="951"></A>One of them is the old traditional method in which most tyrants administer 
<A NAME="952"></A>their government. Of such arts Periander of Corinth is said to have been 
<A NAME="953"></A>the great master, and many similar devices may be gathered from the Persians 
<A NAME="954"></A>in the administration of their government. There are firstly the prescriptions 
<A NAME="955"></A>mentioned some distance back, for the preservation of a tyranny, in so 
<A NAME="956"></A>far as this is possible; viz., that the tyrant should lop off those who 
<A NAME="957"></A>are too high; he must put to death men of spirit; he must not allow common 
<A NAME="958"></A>meals, clubs, education, and the like; he must be upon his guard against 
<A NAME="959"></A>anything which is likely to inspire either courage or confidence among 
<A NAME="960"></A>his subjects; he must prohibit literary assemblies or other meetings for 
<A NAME="961"></A>discussion, and he must take every means to prevent people from knowing 
<A NAME="962"></A>one another (for acquaintance begets mutual confidence). Further, he must 
<A NAME="963"></A>compel all persons staying in the city to appear in public and live at 
<A NAME="964"></A>his gates; then he will know what they are doing: if they are always kept 
<A NAME="965"></A>under, they will learn to be humble. In short, he should practice these 
<A NAME="966"></A>and the like Persian and barbaric arts, which all have the same object. 
<A NAME="967"></A>A tyrant should also endeavor to know what each of his subjects says or 
<A NAME="968"></A>does, and should employ spies, like the 'female detectives' at Syracuse, 
<A NAME="969"></A>and the eavesdroppers whom Hiero was in the habit of sending to any place 
<A NAME="970"></A>of resort or meeting; for the fear of informers prevents people from speaking 
<A NAME="971"></A>their minds, and if they do, they are more easily found out. Another art 
<A NAME="972"></A>of the tyrant is to sow quarrels among the citizens; friends should be 
<A NAME="973"></A>embroiled with friends, the people with the notables, and the rich with 
<A NAME="974"></A>one another. Also he should impoverish his subjects; he thus provides against 
<A NAME="975"></A>the maintenance of a guard by the citizen and the people, having to keep 
<A NAME="976"></A>hard at work, are prevented from conspiring. The Pyramids of Egypt afford 
<A NAME="977"></A>an example of this policy; also the offerings of the family of Cypselus, 
<A NAME="978"></A>and the building of the temple of Olympian Zeus by the Peisistratidae, 
<A NAME="979"></A>and the great Polycratean monuments at Samos; all these works were alike 
<A NAME="980"></A>intended to occupy the people and keep them poor. Another practice of tyrants 
<A NAME="981"></A>is to multiply taxes, after the manner of Dionysius at Syracuse, who contrived 
<A NAME="982"></A>that within five years his subjects should bring into the treasury their 
<A NAME="983"></A>whole property. The tyrant is also fond of making war in order that his 
<A NAME="984"></A>subjects may have something to do and be always in want of a leader. And 
<A NAME="985"></A>whereas the power of a king is preserved by his friends, the characteristic 
<A NAME="986"></A>of a tyrant is to distrust his friends, because he knows that all men want 
<A NAME="987"></A>to overthrow him, and they above all have the power.
<A NAME="988"></A><BR><BR>Again, the evil practices of the last and worst form of democracy 
<A NAME="989"></A>are all found in tyrannies. Such are the power given to women in their 
<A NAME="990"></A>families in the hope that they will inform against their husbands, and 
<A NAME="991"></A>the license which is allowed to slaves in order that they may betray their 
<A NAME="992"></A>masters; for slaves and women do not conspire against tyrants; and they 
<A NAME="993"></A>are of course friendly to tyrannies and also to democracies, since under 
<A NAME="994"></A>them they have a good time. For the people too would fain be a monarch, 
<A NAME="995"></A>and therefore by them, as well as by the tyrant, the flatterer is held 
<A NAME="996"></A>in honor; in democracies he is the demagogue; and the tyrant also has those 
<A NAME="997"></A>who associate with him in a humble spirit, which is a work of 
<A NAME="998"></A>flattery.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR><BR>Hence tyrants are always fond of bad men, because they love to 
<A NAME="1000"></A>be flattered, but no man who has the spirit of a freeman in him will lower 
<A NAME="1001"></A>himself by flattery; good men love others, or at any rate do not flatter 
<A NAME="1002"></A>them. Moreover, the bad are useful for bad purposes; 'nail knocks out nail,' 
<A NAME="1003"></A>as the proverb says. It is characteristic of a tyrant to dislike every 
<A NAME="1004"></A>one who has dignity or independence; he wants to be alone in his glory, 
<A NAME="1005"></A>but any one who claims a like dignity or asserts his independence encroaches 
<A NAME="1006"></A>upon his prerogative, and is hated by him as an enemy to his power. Another 
<A NAME="1007"></A>mark of a tyrant is that he likes foreigners better than citizens, and 
<A NAME="1008"></A>lives with them and invites them to his table; for the one are enemies, 
<A NAME="1009"></A>but the Others enter into no rivalry with him.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR><BR>Such are the notes of the tyrant and the arts by which he preserves 
<A NAME="1011"></A>his power; there is no wickedness too great for him. All that we have said 
<A NAME="1012"></A>may be summed up under three heads, which answer to the three aims of the 
<A NAME="1013"></A>tyrant. These are, (1) the humiliation of his subjects; he knows that a 
<A NAME="1014"></A>mean-spirited man will not conspire against anybody; (2) the creation of 
<A NAME="1015"></A>mistrust among them; for a tyrant is not overthrown until men begin to 
<A NAME="1016"></A>have confidence in one another; and this is the reason why tyrants are 
<A NAME="1017"></A>at war with the good; they are under the idea that their power is endangered 
<A NAME="1018"></A>by them, not only because they would not be ruled despotically but also 
<A NAME="1019"></A>because they are loyal to one another, and to other men, and do not inform 
<A NAME="1020"></A>against one another or against other men; (3) the tyrant desires that his 
<A NAME="1021"></A>subjects shall be incapable of action, for no one attempts what is impossible, 
<A NAME="1022"></A>and they will not attempt to overthrow a tyranny, if they are powerless. 
<A NAME="1023"></A>Under these three heads the whole policy of a tyrant may be summed up, 
<A NAME="1024"></A>and to one or other of them all his ideas may be referred: (1) he sows 
<A NAME="1025"></A>distrust among his subjects; (2) he takes away their power; (3) he humbles 
<A NAME="1026"></A>them.
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR><BR>This then is one of the two methods by which tyrannies are preserved; 
<A NAME="1028"></A>and there is another which proceeds upon an almost opposite principle of 
<A NAME="1029"></A>action. The nature of this latter method may be gathered from a comparison 
<A NAME="1030"></A>of the causes which destroy kingdoms, for as one mode of destroying kingly 
<A NAME="1031"></A>power is to make the office of king more tyrannical, so the salvation of 
<A NAME="1032"></A>a tyranny is to make it more like the rule of a king. But of one thing 
<A NAME="1033"></A>the tyrant must be careful; he must keep power enough to rule over his 
<A NAME="1034"></A>subjects, whether they like him or not, for if he once gives this up he 
<A NAME="1035"></A>gives up his tyranny. But though power must be retained as the foundation, 
<A NAME="1036"></A>in all else the tyrant should act or appear to act in the character of 
<A NAME="1037"></A>a king. In the first place he should pretend a care of the public revenues, 
<A NAME="1038"></A>and not waste money in making presents of a sort at which the common people 
<A NAME="1039"></A>get excited when they see their hard-won earnings snatched from them and 
<A NAME="1040"></A>lavished on courtesans and strangers and artists. He should give an account 
<A NAME="1041"></A>of what he receives and of what he spends (a practice which has been adopted 
<A NAME="1042"></A>by some tyrants); for then he will seem to be a steward of the public rather 
<A NAME="1043"></A>than a tyrant; nor need he fear that, while he is the lord of the city, 
<A NAME="1044"></A>he will ever be in want of money. Such a policy is at all events much more 
<A NAME="1045"></A>advantageous for the tyrant when he goes from home, than to leave behind 
<A NAME="1046"></A>him a hoard, for then the garrison who remain in the city will be less 
<A NAME="1047"></A>likely to attack his power; and a tyrant, when he is absent from home, 
<A NAME="1048"></A>has more reason to fear the guardians of his treasure than the citizens, 
<A NAME="1049"></A>for the one accompany him, but the others remain behind. In the second 
<A NAME="1050"></A>place, he should be seen to collect taxes and to require public services 
<A NAME="1051"></A>only for state purposes, and that he may form a fund in case of war, and 
<A NAME="1052"></A>generally he ought to make himself the guardian and treasurer of them, 
<A NAME="1053"></A>as if they belonged, not to him, but to the public. He should appear, not 
<A NAME="1054"></A>harsh, but dignified, and when men meet him they should look upon him with 
<A NAME="1055"></A>reverence, and not with fear. Yet it is hard for him to be respected if 
<A NAME="1056"></A>he inspires no respect, and therefore whatever virtues he may neglect, 
<A NAME="1057"></A>at least he should maintain the character of a great soldier, and produce 
<A NAME="1058"></A>the impression that he is one. Neither he nor any of his associates should 
<A NAME="1059"></A>ever be guilty of the least offense against modesty towards the young of 
<A NAME="1060"></A>either sex who are his subjects, and the women of his family should observe 
<A NAME="1061"></A>a like self-control towards other women; the insolence of women has ruined 
<A NAME="1062"></A>many tyrannies. In the indulgence of pleasures he should be the opposite 
<A NAME="1063"></A>of our modern tyrants, who not only begin at dawn and pass whole days in 
<A NAME="1064"></A>sensuality, but want other men to see them, that they may admire their 
<A NAME="1065"></A>happy and blessed lot. In these things a tyrant should if possible be moderate, 
<A NAME="1066"></A>or at any rate should not parade his vices to the world; for a drunken 
<A NAME="1067"></A>and drowsy tyrant is soon despised and attacked; not so he who is temperate 
<A NAME="1068"></A>and wide awake. His conduct should be the very reverse of nearly everything 
<A NAME="1069"></A>which has been said before about tyrants. He ought to adorn and improve 
<A NAME="1070"></A>his city, as though he were not a tyrant, but the guardian of the state. 
<A NAME="1071"></A>Also he should appear to be particularly earnest in the service of the 
<A NAME="1072"></A>Gods; for if men think that a ruler is religious and has a reverence for 
<A NAME="1073"></A>the Gods, they are less afraid of suffering injustice at his hands, and 
<A NAME="1074"></A>they are less disposed to conspire against him, because they believe him 
<A NAME="1075"></A>to have the very Gods fighting on his side. At the same time his religion 
<A NAME="1076"></A>must not be thought foolish. And he should honor men of merit, and make 
<A NAME="1077"></A>them think that they would not be held in more honor by the citizens if 
<A NAME="1078"></A>they had a free government. The honor he should distribute himself, but 
<A NAME="1079"></A>the punishment should be inflicted by officers and courts of law. It is 
<A NAME="1080"></A>a precaution which is taken by all monarchs not to make one person great; 
<A NAME="1081"></A>but if one, then two or more should be raised, that they may look sharply 
<A NAME="1082"></A>after one another. If after all some one has to be made great, he should 
<A NAME="1083"></A>not be a man of bold spirit; for such dispositions are ever most inclined 
<A NAME="1084"></A>to strike. And if any one is to be deprived of his power, let it b
