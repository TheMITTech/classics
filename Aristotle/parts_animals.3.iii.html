<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>We have next to consider the teeth, and with these the mouth, that is the 
<A NAME="12"></A>cavity which they enclose and form. The teeth have one invariable office, 
<A NAME="13"></A>namely the reduction of food; but besides this general function they have 
<A NAME="14"></A>other special ones, and these differ in different groups. Thus in some 
<A NAME="15"></A>animals the teeth serve as weapons; but this with a distinction. For there 
<A NAME="16"></A>are offensive weapons and there are defensive weapons; and while in some 
<A NAME="17"></A>animals, as the wild Carnivora, the teeth answer both purposes, in many 
<A NAME="18"></A>others, both wild and domesticated, they serve only for defence. In man 
<A NAME="19"></A>the teeth are admirably constructed for their general office, the front 
<A NAME="20"></A>ones being sharp, so as to cut the food into bits, and the hinder ones 
<A NAME="21"></A>broad and flat, so as to grind it to a pulp; while between these and separating 
<A NAME="22"></A>them are the dog-teeth, which, in accordance with the rule that the mean 
<A NAME="23"></A>partakes of both extremes, share in the characters of those on either side, 
<A NAME="24"></A>being broad in one part but sharp in another. Similar distinctions of shape 
<A NAME="25"></A>are presented by the teeth of other animals, with the exception of those 
<A NAME="26"></A>whose teeth are one and all of the sharp kind. In man, however, the number 
<A NAME="27"></A>and the character even of these sharp teeth have been mainly determined 
<A NAME="28"></A>by the requirements of speech. For the front teeth of man contribute in 
<A NAME="29"></A>many ways to the formation of letter-sounds.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>In some animals, however, the teeth, as already said, serve merely 
<A NAME="31"></A>for the reduction of food. When, besides this, they serve as offensive 
<A NAME="32"></A>and defensive weapons, they may either be formed into tusks, as for instance 
<A NAME="33"></A>is the case in swine, or may be sharp-pointed and interlock with those 
<A NAME="34"></A>of the opposite jaw, in which case the animal is said to be saw-toothed. 
<A NAME="35"></A>The explanation of this latter arrangement is as follows. The strength 
<A NAME="36"></A>of such an animal is in its teeth, and these depend for their efficiency 
<A NAME="37"></A>on their sharpness. In order, then, to prevent their getting blunted by 
<A NAME="38"></A>mutual friction, such of them as serve for weapons fit into each other's 
<A NAME="39"></A>interspaces, and are so kept in proper condition. No animal that has sharp 
<A NAME="40"></A>interfitting teeth is at the same time furnished with tusks. For nature 
<A NAME="41"></A>never makes anything superfluous or in vain. She gives, therefore, tusks 
<A NAME="42"></A>to such animals as strike in fighting, and serrated teeth to such as bite. 
<A NAME="43"></A>Sows, for instance, have no tusks, and accordingly sows bite instead of 
<A NAME="44"></A>striking.
<A NAME="45"></A><BR><BR>A general principle must here be noted, which will be found applicable 
<A NAME="46"></A>not only in this instance but in many others that will occur later on. 
<A NAME="47"></A>Nature allots each weapon, offensive and defensive alike, to those animals 
<A NAME="48"></A>alone that can use it; or, if not to them alone, to them in a more marked 
<A NAME="49"></A>degree; and she allots it in its most perfect state to those that can use 
<A NAME="50"></A>it best; and this whether it be a sting, or a spur, or horns, or tusks, 
<A NAME="51"></A>or what it may of a like kind.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>Thus as males are stronger and more choleric than females, it is 
<A NAME="53"></A>in males that such parts as those just mentioned are found, either exclusively, 
<A NAME="54"></A>as in some species, or more fully developed, as in others. For though females 
<A NAME="55"></A>are of course provided with such parts as are no less necessary to them 
<A NAME="56"></A>than to males, the parts, for instance, which subserve nutrition, they 
<A NAME="57"></A>have even these in an inferior degree, and the parts which answer no such 
<A NAME="58"></A>necessary purpose they do not possess at all. This explains why stags have 
<A NAME="59"></A>horns, while does have none; why the horns of cows are different from those 
<A NAME="60"></A>of bulls, and, similarly, the horns of ewes from those of rams. It explains 
<A NAME="61"></A>also why the females are often without spurs in species where the males 
<A NAME="62"></A>are provided with them, and accounts for similar facts relating to all 
<A NAME="63"></A>other such parts.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>All fishes have teeth of the serrated form, with the single exception 
<A NAME="65"></A>of the fish known as the Scarus. In many of them there are teeth even on 
<A NAME="66"></A>the tongue and on the roof of the mouth. The reason for this is that, living 
<A NAME="67"></A>as they do in the water, they cannot but allow this fluid to pass into 
<A NAME="68"></A>the mouth with the food. The fluid thus admitted they must necessarily 
<A NAME="69"></A>discharge again without delay. For were they not to do so, but to retain 
<A NAME="70"></A>it for a time while triturating the food, the water would run into their 
<A NAME="71"></A>digestive cavities. Their teeth therefore are all sharp, being adapted 
<A NAME="72"></A>only for cutting, and are numerous and set in many parts, that their abundance 
<A NAME="73"></A>may serve in lieu of any grinding faculty, to mince the food into small 
<A NAME="74"></A>bits. They are also curved, because these are almost the only weapons which 
<A NAME="75"></A>fishes possess.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>In all these offices of the teeth the mouth also takes its part; 
<A NAME="77"></A>but besides these functions it is subservient to respiration, in all such 
<A NAME="78"></A>animals as breathe and are cooled by external agency. For nature, as already 
<A NAME="79"></A>said, uses the parts which are common to all animals for many special purposes, 
<A NAME="80"></A>and this of her own accord. Thus the mouth has one universal function in 
<A NAME="81"></A>all animals alike, namely its alimentary office; but in some, besides this, 
<A NAME="82"></A>the special duty of serving as a weapon is attached to it; in others that 
<A NAME="83"></A>of ministering to speech; and again in many, though not in all, the office 
<A NAME="84"></A>of respiration. All these functions are thrown by nature upon one single 
<A NAME="85"></A>organ, the construction of which she varies so as to suit the variations 
<A NAME="86"></A>of office. Therefore it is that in some animals the mouth is contracted, 
<A NAME="87"></A>while in others it is of wide dimensions. The contracted form belongs to 
<A NAME="88"></A>such animals as use the mouth merely for nutritive, respiratory, and vocal 
<A NAME="89"></A>purposes; whereas in such as use it as a means of defence it has a wide 
<A NAME="90"></A>gape. This is its invariable form in such animals as are saw-toothed. For 
<A NAME="91"></A>seeing that their mode of warfare consists in biting, it is advantageous 
<A NAME="92"></A>to them that their mouth shall have a wide opening; for the wider it opens, 
<A NAME="93"></A>the greater will be the extent of the bite, and the more numerous will 
<A NAME="94"></A>be the teeth called into play.
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>What has just been said applies to fishes as well as to other animals; 
<A NAME="96"></A>and thus in such of them as are carnivorous, and made for biting, the mouth 
<A NAME="97"></A>has a wide gape; whereas in the rest it is small, being placed at the extremity 
<A NAME="98"></A>of a tapering snout. For this form is suited for their purposes, while 
<A NAME="99"></A>the other would be useless.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>In birds the mouth consists of what is called the beak, which in 
<A NAME="101"></A>them is a substitute for lips and teeth. This beak presents variations 
<A NAME="102"></A>in harmony with the functions and protective purposes which it serves. 
<A NAME="103"></A>Thus in those birds that are called Crooked-clawed it is invariably hooked, 
<A NAME="104"></A>inasmuch as these birds are carnivorous, and eat no kind of vegetable food 
<A NAME="105"></A>whatsoever. For this form renders it serviceable to them in obtaining the 
<A NAME="106"></A>mastery over their prey, and is better suited for deeds of violence than 
<A NAME="107"></A>any other. Moreover, as their weapons of offence consist of this beak and 
<A NAME="108"></A>of their claws, these latter also are more crooked in them than in the 
<A NAME="109"></A>generality of birds. Similarly in each other kind of bird the beak is suited 
<A NAME="110"></A>to the mode of life. Thus, in woodpeckers it is hard and strong, as also 
<A NAME="111"></A>in crows and birds of crowlike habit, while in the smaller birds it is 
<A NAME="112"></A>delicate, so as to be of use in collecting seeds and picking up minute 
<A NAME="113"></A>animals. In such birds, again, as eat herbage, and such as live about marshes-those, 
<A NAME="114"></A>for example, that swim and have webbed feet-the bill is broad, or adapted 
<A NAME="115"></A>in some other way to the mode of life. For a broad bill enables a bird 
<A NAME="116"></A>to dig into the ground with ease, just as, among quadrupeds, does the broad 
<A NAME="117"></A>snout of the pig, an animal which, like the birds in question, lives on 
<A NAME="118"></A>roots. Moreover, in these root-eating birds and in some others of like 
<A NAME="119"></A>habits of life, the tips of the bill end in hard points, which gives them 
<A NAME="120"></A>additional facility in dealing with herbaceous food.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>The several parts which are set on the head have now, pretty nearly 
<A NAME="122"></A>all, been considered. In man, however, the part which lies between the 
<A NAME="123"></A>head and the neck is called the face, this name, (prosopon) being, it would 
<A NAME="124"></A>seem, derived from the function of the part. For as man is the only animal 
<A NAME="125"></A>that stands erect, he is also the only one that looks directly in front 
<A NAME="126"></A>(proso) and the only one whose voice is emitted in that 
<A NAME="127"></A>direction.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="128"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>We have now to treat of horns; for these also, when present, are 
<A NAME="130"></A>appendages of the head. They exist in none but viviparous animals; though 
<A NAME="131"></A>in some ovipara certain parts are metaphorically spoken of as horns, in 
<A NAME="132"></A>virtue of a certain resemblance. To none of such parts, however, does the 
<A NAME="133"></A>proper office of a horn belong; for they are never used, as are the horns 
<A NAME="134"></A>of vivipara, for purposes which require strength, whether it be in self-protection 
<A NAME="135"></A>or in offensive strife. So also no polydactylous animal is furnished with 
<A NAME="136"></A>horns. For horns are defensive weapons, and these polydactylous animals 
<A NAME="137"></A>possess other means of security. For to some of them nature has given claws, 
<A NAME="138"></A>to others teeth suited for combat, and to the rest some other adequate 
<A NAME="139"></A>defensive appliance. There are horns, however, in most of the cloven-hoofed 
<A NAME="140"></A>animals, and in some of those that have a solid hoof, serving them as an 
<A NAME="141"></A>offensive weapon, and in some cases also as a defensive one. There are 
<A NAME="142"></A>horns also in all animals that have not been provided by nature with some 
<A NAME="143"></A>other means of security; such means, for instance, as speed, which has 
<A NAME="144"></A>been given to horses; or great size, as in camels; for excessive bulk, 
<A NAME="145"></A>such as has been given to these animals, and in a still greater measure 
<A NAME="146"></A>to elephants, is sufficient in itself to protect an animal from being destroyed 
<A NAME="147"></A>by others. Other animals again are protected by the possession of tusks; 
<A NAME="148"></A>and among these are the swine, though they have a cloven 
<A NAME="149"></A>hoof.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>All animals again, whose horns are but useless appendages, have 
<A NAME="151"></A>been provided by nature with some additional means of security. Thus deer 
<A NAME="152"></A>are endowed with speed; for the large size and great branching of their 
<A NAME="153"></A>horns makes these a source of detriment rather than of profit to their 
<A NAME="154"></A>possessors. Similarly endowed are the Bubalus and gazelle; for though these 
<A NAME="155"></A>animals will stand up against some enemies and defend themselves with their 
<A NAME="156"></A>horns, yet they run away from such as are fierce and pugnacious. The Bonasus 
<A NAME="157"></A>again, whoe horns curve inwards towards each other, is provided with a 
<A NAME="158"></A>means of protection in the discharge of its excrement; and of this it avails 
<A NAME="159"></A>itself when frightened. There are some other animals besides the Bonasus 
<A NAME="160"></A>that have a similar mode of defence. In no case, however, does nature ever 
<A NAME="161"></A>give more than one adequate means of protection to one and the same 
<A NAME="162"></A>animal.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>Most of the animals that have horns are cloven-hoofed; but the 
<A NAME="164"></A>Indian ass, as they call it, is also reported to be horned, though its 
<A NAME="165"></A>hoof is solid.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>Again as the body, so far as regards its organs of motion, consists 
<A NAME="167"></A>of two distinct parts, the right and the left, so also and for like reasons 
<A NAME="168"></A>the horns of animals are, in the great majority of cases, two in number. 
<A NAME="169"></A>Still there are some that have but a single horn; the Oryx, for instance, 
<A NAME="170"></A>and the so-called Indian ass; in the former of which the hoof is cloven, 
<A NAME="171"></A>while in the latter it is solid. In such animals the horn is set in the 
<A NAME="172"></A>centre of the head; for as the middle belongs equally to both extremes, 
<A NAME="173"></A>this arrangement is the one that comes nearest to each side having its 
<A NAME="174"></A>own horn.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>Again, it would appear consistent with reason that the single horn 
<A NAME="176"></A>should go with the solid rather than with the cloven hoof. For hoof, whether 
<A NAME="177"></A>solid or cloven, is of the same nature as horn; so that the two naturally 
<A NAME="178"></A>undergo division simultaneously and in the same animals. Again, since the 
<A NAME="179"></A>division of the cloven hoof depends on deficiency of material, it is but 
<A NAME="180"></A>rationally consistent, that nature, when she gave an animal an excess of 
<A NAME="181"></A>material for the hoofs, which thus became solid, should have taken away 
<A NAME="182"></A>something from the upper parts and so made the animal to have but one horn. 
<A NAME="183"></A>Rightly too did she act when she chose the head whereon to set the horns; 
<A NAME="184"></A>and AEsop's Momus is beside the mark, when he finds fault with the bull 
<A NAME="185"></A>for not having its horns upon its shoulders. For from this position, says 
<A NAME="186"></A>he, they would have delivered their blow with the greatest force, whereas 
<A NAME="187"></A>on the head they occupy the weakest part of the whole body. Momus was but 
<A NAME="188"></A>dull-sighted in making this hostile criticism. For had the horns been set 
<A NAME="189"></A>on the shoulders, or had they been set on any other part than they are, 
<A NAME="190"></A>the encumbrance of their weight would have been increased, not only without 
<A NAME="191"></A>any compensating gain whatso::ver, but with the disadvantage of impeding 
<A NAME="192"></A>many bodily operations. For the point whence the blows could be delivered 
<A NAME="193"></A>with the greatest force was not the only matter to be considered, but the 
<A NAME="194"></A>point also whence they could be delivered with the widest range. But as 
<A NAME="195"></A>the bull has no hands and cannot possibly have its horns on its feet or 
<A NAME="196"></A>on its knees, where they would prevent flexion, there remains no other 
<A NAME="197"></A>site for them but the head; and this therefore they necessarily occupy. 
<A NAME="198"></A>In this position, moreover, they are much less in the way of the movements 
<A NAME="199"></A>of the body than they would be elsewhere.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>Deer are the only animals in which the horns are solid throughout, 
<A NAME="201"></A>and are also the only animals that cast them. This casting is not simply 
<A NAME="202"></A>advantageous to the deer from the increased lightness which it produces, 
<A NAME="203"></A>but, seeing how heavy the horns are, is a matter of actual 
<A NAME="204"></A>necessity.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>In all other animals the horns are hollow for a certain distance, 
<A NAME="206"></A>and the end alone is solid, this being the part of use in a blow. At the 
<A NAME="207"></A>same time, to prevent even the hollow part from being weak, the horn, though 
<A NAME="208"></A>it grows out of the skin, has a solid piece from the bones fitted into 
<A NAME="209"></A>its cavity. For this arrangement is not only that which makes the horns 
<A NAME="210"></A>of the greatest service in fighting, but that which causes them to be as 
<A NAME="211"></A>little of an impediment as possible in the other actions of 
<A NAME="212"></A>life.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>Such then are the reasons for which horns exist; and such the reasons 
<A NAME="214"></A>why they are present in some animals, absent from others.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>Let us now consider the character of the material nature whose 
<A NAME="216"></A>necessary results have been made available by rational nature for a final 
<A NAME="217"></A>cause.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>In the first place, then, the larger the bulk of animals, the greater 
<A NAME="219"></A>is the proportion of corporeal and earthy matter which they contain. Thus 
<A NAME="220"></A>no very small animal is known to have horns, the smallest horned animal 
<A NAME="221"></A>that we are acquainted with being the gazelle. But in all our speculations 
<A NAME="222"></A>concerning nature, what we have to consider is the general rule; for that 
<A NAME="223"></A>is natural which applies either universally or generally. And thus when 
<A NAME="224"></A>we say that the largest animals have most earthy matter, we say so because 
<A NAME="225"></A>such is the general rule. Now this earthy matter is used in the animal 
<A NAME="226"></A>body to form bone. But in the larger animals there is an excess of it, 
<A NAME="227"></A>and this excess is turned by nature to useful account, being converted 
<A NAME="228"></A>into weapons of defence. Part of it necessarily flows to the upper portion 
<A NAME="229"></A>of the body, and this is allotted by her in some cases to the formation 
<A NAME="230"></A>of tusks and teeth, in others to the formation of horns. Thus it is that 
<A NAME="231"></A>no animal that has horns has also front teeth in both jaws, those in the 
<A NAME="232"></A>upper jaw being deficient. For nature by subtracting from the teeth adds 
<A NAME="233"></A>to the horns; the nutriment which in most animals goes to the former being 
<A NAME="234"></A>here spent on the augmentation of the latter. Does, it is true, have no 
<A NAME="235"></A>horns and yet are equally deficient with the males as regards the teeth. 
<A NAME="236"></A>The reason, however, for this is that they, as much as the males, are naturally 
<A NAME="237"></A>horn-bearing animals; but they have been stripped of their horns, because 
<A NAME="238"></A>these would not only be useless to them but actually baneful; whereas the 
<A NAME="239"></A>greater strength of the males causes these organs, though equally useless, 
<A NAME="240"></A>to be less of an impediment. In other animals, where this material is not 
<A NAME="241"></A>secreted from the body in the shape of horns, it is used to increase the 
<A NAME="242"></A>size of the teeth; in some cases of all the teeth, in others merely of 
<A NAME="243"></A>the tusks, which thus become so long as to resemble horns projecting from 
<A NAME="244"></A>the jaws.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>So much, then, of the parts which appertain to the 
<A NAME="246"></A>head.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="247"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="248"></A><BR><BR>Below the head lies the neck, in such animals as have one. This 
<A NAME="249"></A>is the case with those only that have the parts to which a neck is subservient. 
<A NAME="250"></A>These parts are the larynx and what is called the oesophagus. Of these 
<A NAME="251"></A>the former, or larynx, exists for the sake of respiration, being the instrument 
<A NAME="252"></A>by which such animals as breathe inhale and discharge the air. Therefore 
<A NAME="253"></A>it is that, when there is no lung, there is also no neck. Of this condition 
<A NAME="254"></A>the Fishes are an example. The other part, or oesophagus, is the channel 
<A NAME="255"></A>through which food is conveyed to the stomach; so that all animals that 
<A NAME="256"></A>are without a neck are also without a distinct oesophagus; Such a part 
<A NAME="257"></A>is in fact not required of necessity for nutritive purposes; for it has 
<A NAME="258"></A>no action whatsoever on the food. Indeed there is nothing to prevent the 
<A NAME="259"></A>stomach from being placed directly after the mouth. This, however, is quite 
<A NAME="260"></A>impossible in the case of the lung. For there must be some sort of tube 
<A NAME="261"></A>common to the two divisions of the lung, by which--it being bipartite--the 
<A NAME="262"></A>breath may be apportioned to their respective bronchi, and thence pass 
<A NAME="263"></A>into the air-pipes; and such an arrangement will be the best for giving 
<A NAME="264"></A>perfection to inspiration and expiration. The organ then concerned in respiration 
<A NAME="265"></A>must of necessity be of some length; and this, again, necessitates there 
<A NAME="266"></A>being an oesophagus to unite mouth and stomach. This oesophagus is of a 
<A NAME="267"></A>flesh-like character, and yet admits of extension like a sinew. This latter 
<A NAME="268"></A>property is given to it, that it may stretch when food is introduced; while 
<A NAME="269"></A>the flesh-like character is intended to make it soft and yielding, and 
<A NAME="270"></A>to prevent it from being rasped by particles as they pass downwards, and 
<A NAME="271"></A>so suffering damage. On the other hand, the windpipe and the so-called 
<A NAME="272"></A>larynx are constructed out of a cartilaginous substance. For they have 
<A NAME="273"></A>to serve not only for respiration, but also for vocal purposes; and an 
<A NAME="274"></A>instrument that is to produce sounds must necessarily be not only smooth 
<A NAME="275"></A>but firm. The windpipe lies in front of the oesophagus, although this position 
<A NAME="276"></A>causes it to be some hindrance to the latter in the act of deglutition. 
<A NAME="277"></A>For if a morsel of food, fluid or solid, slips into it by accident, choking 
<A NAME="278"></A>and much distress and violent fits of coughing ensue. This must be a matter 
<A NAME="279"></A>of astonishment to any of those who assert that it is by the windpipe that 
<A NAME="280"></A>an animal imbibes fluid. For the consequences just mentioned occur invariably, 
<A NAME="281"></A>whenever a particle of food slips in, and are quite obvious. Indeed on 
<A NAME="282"></A>many grounds it is ridiculous to say that this is the channel through which 
<A NAME="283"></A>animals imbibe fluid. For there is no passage leading from the lung to 
<A NAME="284"></A>the stomach, such as the oesophagus which we see leading thither from the 
<A NAME="285"></A>mouth. Moreover, when any cause produces sickness and vomiting, it is plain 
<A NAME="286"></A>enough when the fluid is discharged. It is manifest also that fluid, when 
<A NAME="287"></A>swallowed, does not pass directly into the bladder and collect there, but 
<A NAME="288"></A>goes first into the stomach. For, when red wine is taken, the dejections 
<A NAME="289"></A>of the stomach are seen to be coloured by its dregs; and such discoloration 
<A NAME="290"></A>has been even seen on many occasions inside the stomach itself, in cases 
<A NAME="291"></A>where there have been wounds opening into that organ. However, it is perhaps 
<A NAME="292"></A>silly to be minutely particular in dealing with silly statements such as 
<A NAME="293"></A>this.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>The windpipe then, owing to its position in front of the oesophagus, 
<A NAME="295"></A>is exposed, as we have said, to annoyance from the food. To obviate this, 
<A NAME="296"></A>however, nature has contrived the epiglottis. This part is not found in 
<A NAME="297"></A>all sanguineous animals, but only in such of them as have a lung; nor in 
<A NAME="298"></A>all of these, but only in such as at the same time have their skin covered 
<A NAME="299"></A>with hairs, and not either with scaly plates or with feathers. In such 
<A NAME="300"></A>scaly and feathered animals there is no epiglottis, but its office is supplied 
<A NAME="301"></A>by the larynx, which closes and opens, just as in the other case the epiglottis 
<A NAME="302"></A>falls down and rises up; rising up during the ingress or egress of breath, 
<A NAME="303"></A>and falling down during the ingestion of food, so as to prevent any particle 
<A NAME="304"></A>from slipping into the windpipe. Should there be the slightest want of 
<A NAME="305"></A>accuracy in this movement, or should an inspiration be made during the 
<A NAME="306"></A>ingestion of food, choking and coughing ensue, as already has been noticed. 
<A NAME="307"></A>So admirably contrived, however, is the movement both of the epiglottis 
<A NAME="308"></A>and of the tongue, that, while the food is being ground to a pulp in the 
<A NAME="309"></A>mouth, the tongue very rarely gets caught between the teeth; and, while 
<A NAME="310"></A>the food is passing over the epiglottis seldom does a particle of it slip 
<A NAME="311"></A>into the windpipe.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>The animals which have been mentioned as having no epiglottis owe 
<A NAME="313"></A>this deficiency to the dryness of their flesh and to the hardness of their 
<A NAME="314"></A>skin. For an epiglottis made of such materials would not admit of easy 
<A NAME="315"></A>motion. It would, indeed, take a longer time to shut down an epiglottis 
<A NAME="316"></A>made of the peculiar flesh of these animals, and shaped like that of those 
<A NAME="317"></A>with hairy skins, than to bring the edges of the windpipe itself into contact 
<A NAME="318"></A>with each other.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>Thus much then as to the reason why some animals have an epiglottis 
<A NAME="320"></A>while others have none, and thus much also as to its use. It is a contrivance 
<A NAME="321"></A>of nature to remedy the vicious position of the windpipe in front of the 
<A NAME="322"></A>oesophagus. That position is the result of necessity. For it is in the 
<A NAME="323"></A>front and centre of the body that the heart is situated, in which we say 
<A NAME="324"></A>is the principle of life and the source of all motion and sensation. (For 
<A NAME="325"></A>sensation and motion are exercised in the direction which we term forwards, 
<A NAME="326"></A>and it is on this very relation that the distinction of before and behind 
<A NAME="327"></A>is founded.) But where the heart is, there and surrounding it is the lung. 
<A NAME="328"></A>Now inspiration, which occurs for the sake of the lung and for the sake 
<A NAME="329"></A>of the principle which has its seat in the heart, is effected through the 
<A NAME="330"></A>windpipe. Since then the heart must of necessity lie in the very front 
<A NAME="331"></A>place of all, it follows that the larynx also and the windpipe must of 
<A NAME="332"></A>necessity lie in front of the oesophagus. For they lead to the lung and 
<A NAME="333"></A>heart, whereas the oesophagus leads to the stomach. And it is a universal 
<A NAME="334"></A>law that, as regards above and below, front and back, right and left, the 
<A NAME="335"></A>nobler and more honourable part invariably is placed uppermost, in front, 
<A NAME="336"></A>and on the right, rather than in the opposite positions, unless some more 
<A NAME="337"></A>important object stands in the way.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="338"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>We have now dealt with the neck, the oesophagus, and the windpipe, 
<A NAME="340"></A>and have next to treat of the viscera. These are peculiar to sanguineous 
<A NAME="341"></A>animals, some of which have all of them, others only a part, while no bloodless 
<A NAME="342"></A>animals have any at all. Democritus then seems to have been mistaken in 
<A NAME="343"></A>the notion he formed of the viscera, if, that is to say, he fancied that 
<A NAME="344"></A>the reason why none were discoverable in bloodless animals was that these 
<A NAME="345"></A>animals were too small to allow them to be seen. For, in sanguineous animals, 
<A NAME="346"></A>both heart and liver are visible enough when the body is only just formed, 
<A NAME="347"></A>and while it is still extremely small. For these parts are to be seen in 
<A NAME="348"></A>the egg sometimes as early as the third day, being then no bigger than 
<A NAME="349"></A>a point; and are visible also in aborted embryos, while still excessively 
<A NAME="350"></A>minute. Moreover, as the external organs are not precisely alike in all 
<A NAME="351"></A>animals, but each creature is provided with such as are suited to its special 
<A NAME="352"></A>mode of life and motion, so is it with the internal parts, these also differing 
<A NAME="353"></A>in different animals. Viscera, then, are peculiar to sanguineous animals; 
<A NAME="354"></A>and therefore are each and all formed from sanguineous material, as is 
<A NAME="355"></A>plainly to be seen in the new-born young of these animals. For in such 
<A NAME="356"></A>the viscera are more sanguineous, and of greater bulk in proportion to 
<A NAME="357"></A>the body, than at any later period of life, it being in the earliest stage 
<A NAME="358"></A>of formation that the nature of the material and its abundance are most 
<A NAME="359"></A>conspicuous. There is a heart, then, in all sanguineous animals, and the 
<A NAME="360"></A>reason for this has already been given. For that sanguineous animals must 
<A NAME="361"></A>necessarily have blood is self-evident. And, as the blood is fluid, it 
<A NAME="362"></A>is also a matter of necessity that there shall be a receptacle for it; 
<A NAME="363"></A>and it is apparently to meet this requirement that nature has devised the 
<A NAME="364"></A>blood-vessels. These, again, must necessarily have one primary source. 
<A NAME="365"></A>For it is preferable that there shall be one such, when possible, rather 
<A NAME="366"></A>than several. This primary source of the vessels is the heart. For the 
<A NAME="367"></A>vessels manifestly issue from it and do not go through it. Moreover, being 
<A NAME="368"></A>as it is homogeneous, it has the character of a blood-vessel. Again its 
<A NAME="369"></A>position is that of a primary or dominating part. For nature, when no other 
<A NAME="370"></A>more important purpose stands in her way, places the more honourable part 
<A NAME="371"></A>in the more honourable position; and the heart lies about the centre of 
<A NAME="372"></A>the body, but rather in its upper than its lower half, and also more in 
<A NAME="373"></A>front than behind. This is most evident in the case of man, but even in 
<A NAME="374"></A>other animals there is a tendency in the heart to assume a similar position, 
<A NAME="375"></A>in the centre of the necessary part of the body, that is to say of the 
<A NAME="376"></A>part which terminates in the vent for excrement. For the limbs vary in 
<A NAME="377"></A>position in different animals, and are not to be counted with the parts 
<A NAME="378"></A>which are necessary for life. For life can be maintained even when they 
<A NAME="379"></A>are removed; while it is self-evident that the addition of them to an animal 
<A NAME="380"></A>is not destructive of it.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>There are some who say that the vessels commence in the head. In 
<A NAME="382"></A>this they are clearly mistaken. For in the first place, according to their 
<A NAME="383"></A>representation, there would be many sources for the vessels, and these 
<A NAME="384"></A>scattered; and secondly, these sources would be in a region that is manifestly 
<A NAME="385"></A>cold, as is shown by its intolerance of chill, whereas the region of the 
<A NAME="386"></A>heart is as manifestly hot. Again, as already said, the vessels continue 
<A NAME="387"></A>their course through the other viscera, but no vessel spreads through the 
<A NAME="388"></A>heart. From this it is quite evident that the heart is a part of the vessels 
<A NAME="389"></A>and their origin; and for this it is well suited by its structure. For 
<A NAME="390"></A>its central part consists of a dense and hollow substance, and is moreover 
<A NAME="391"></A>full of blood, as though the vessels took thence their origin. It is hollow 
<A NAME="392"></A>to serve for the reception of the blood, while its wall is dense, that 
<A NAME="393"></A>it may serve to protect the source of heat. For here, and here alone in 
<A NAME="394"></A>all the viscera and indeed in all the body, there is blood without blood-vessels, 
<A NAME="395"></A>the blood elsewhere being always contained within vessels. Nor is this 
<A NAME="396"></A>but consistent with reason. For the blood is conveyed into the vessels 
<A NAME="397"></A>from the heart, but none passes into the heart from without. For in itself 
<A NAME="398"></A>it constitutes the origin and fountain, or primary receptacle, of the blood. 
<A NAME="399"></A>It is however, from dissections and from observations on the process of 
<A NAME="400"></A>development that the truth of these statements receives its clearest demonstration. 
<A NAME="401"></A>For the heart is the first of all the parts to be formed; and no sooner 
<A NAME="402"></A>is it formed than it contains blood. Moreover, the motions of pain and 
<A NAME="403"></A>pleasure, and generally of all sensation, plainly have their source in 
<A NAME="404"></A>the heart, and find in it their ultimate termination. This, indeed, reason 
<A NAME="405"></A>would lead us to expect. For the source must, when. ever possible, be one; 
<A NAME="406"></A>and, of all places, the best suited for a source is the centre. For the 
<A NAME="407"></A>centre is one, and is equally or almost equally within reach of every part. 
<A NAME="408"></A>Again, as neither the blood itself, nor yet any part which is bloodless, 
<A NAME="409"></A>is endowed with sensation, it is plain that that part which first has blood, 
<A NAME="410"></A>and which holds it as it were in a receptacle, must be the primary source 
<A NAME="411"></A>of sensation. And that this part is the heart is not only a rational inference, 
<A NAME="412"></A>but also evident to the senses. For no sooner is the embryo formed, than 
<A NAME="413"></A>its heart is seen in motion as though it were a living creature, and this 
<A NAME="414"></A>before any of the other parts, it being, as thus shown, the starting-point 
<A NAME="415"></A>of their nature in all animals that have blood. A further evidence of the 
<A NAME="416"></A>truth of what has been stated is the fact that no sanguineous animal is 
<A NAME="417"></A>without a heart. For the primary source of blood must of necessity be present 
<A NAME="418"></A>in them all. It is true that sanguineous animals not only have a heart 
<A NAME="419"></A>but also invariably have a liver. But no one could ever deem the liver 
<A NAME="420"></A>to be the primary organ either of the whole body or of the blood. For the 
<A NAME="421"></A>position in which it is placed is far from being that of a primary or dominating 
<A NAME="422"></A>part; and, moreover, in the most perfectly finished animals there is another 
<A NAME="423"></A>part, the spleen, which as it were counterbalances it. Still further, the 
<A NAME="424"></A>liver contains no spacious receptacle in its substance, as does the heart; 
<A NAME="425"></A>but its blood is in a vessel as in all the other viscera. The vessel, moreover, 
<A NAME="426"></A>extends through it, and no vessel whatsoever originates in it; for it is 
<A NAME="427"></A>from the heart that all the vessels take their rise. Since then one or 
<A NAME="428"></A>other of these two parts must be the central source, and since it is not 
<A NAME="429"></A>the liver which is such, it follows of necessity that it is the heart which 
<A NAME="430"></A>is the source of the blood, as also the primary organ in other respects. 
<A NAME="431"></A>For the definitive characteristic of an animal is the possession of sensation; 
<A NAME="432"></A>and the first sensory part is that which first has blood; that is to say 
<A NAME="433"></A>is the heart, which is the source of blood and the first of the parts to 
<A NAME="434"></A>contain it.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>The apex of the heart is pointed and more solid than the rest of 
<A NAME="436"></A>the organ. It lies against the breast, and entirely in the anterior part 
<A NAME="437"></A>of the body, in order to prevent that region from getting chilled. For 
<A NAME="438"></A>in all animals there is comparatively little flesh over the breast, whereas 
<A NAME="439"></A>there is a more abundant covering of that substance on the posterior surface, 
<A NAME="440"></A>so that the heat has in the back a sufficient amount of protection. In 
<A NAME="441"></A>all animals but man the heart is placed in the centre of the pectoral region; 
<A NAME="442"></A>but in man it inclines a little towards the left, so that it may counterbalance 
<A NAME="443"></A>the chilliness of that side. For the left side is colder in man, as compared 
<A NAME="444"></A>with the right, than in any other animal. It has been stated in an earlier 
<A NAME="445"></A>treatise that even in fishes the heart holds the same position as in other 
<A NAME="446"></A>animals; and the reason has been given why it appears not to do so. The 
<A NAME="447"></A>apex of the heart, it is true, is in them turned towards the head, but 
<A NAME="448"></A>this in fishes is the front aspect, for it is the direction in which their 
<A NAME="449"></A>motion occurs.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>The heart again is abundantly supplied with sinews, as might reasonably 
<A NAME="451"></A>be expected. For the motions of the body commence from the heart, and are 
<A NAME="452"></A>brought about by traction and relaxation. The heart therefore, which, as 
<A NAME="453"></A>already said,' as it were a living creature inside its possessor, requires 
<A NAME="454"></A>some such subservient and strengthening parts.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>In no animals does the heart contain a bone, certainly in none 
<A NAME="456"></A>of those that we have ourselves inspected, with the exception of the horse 
<A NAME="457"></A>and a certain kind of ox. In these exceptional cases the heart, owing to 
<A NAME="458"></A>its large bulk, is provided with a bone as a support; just as the bones 
<A NAME="459"></A>serve as supports for the body generally.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>In animals of great size the heart has three cavities; in smaller 
<A NAME="461"></A>animals it has two; and in all has at least one, for, as already stated, 
<A NAME="462"></A>there must be some place in the heart to serve as a receptacle for the 
<A NAME="463"></A>first blood; which, as has been mentioned more than once, is formed in 
<A NAME="464"></A>this organ. But inasmuch as the main blood-vessels are two in number, namely 
<A NAME="465"></A>the so-called great vessel and the aorta, each of which is the origin of 
<A NAME="466"></A>other vessels; inasmuch, moreover, as these two vessels present differences, 
<A NAME="467"></A>hereafter to be discussed, when compared with each other, it is of advantage 
<A NAME="468"></A>that they also shall themselves have distinct origins. This advantage will 
<A NAME="469"></A>be obtained if each side have its own blood, and the blood of one side 
<A NAME="470"></A>be kept separate from that of the other. For this reason the heart, whenever 
<A NAME="471"></A>it is possible, has two receptacles. And this possibility exists in the 
<A NAME="472"></A>case of large animals, for in them the heart, as the body generally, is 
<A NAME="473"></A>of large size. Again it is still better that there shall be three cavities, 
<A NAME="474"></A>so that the middle and odd one may serve as a centre common to both sides. 
<A NAME="475"></A>But this requires the heart to be of greater magnitude, so that it is only 
<A NAME="476"></A>in the largest hearts that there are three cavities.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR>Of these three cavities it is the right that has the most abundant 
<A NAME="478"></A>and the hottest blood, and this explains why the limbs also on the right 
<A NAME="479"></A>side of the body are warmer than those on the left. The left cavity has 
<A NAME="480"></A>the least blood of all, and the coldest; while in the middle cavity the 
<A NAME="481"></A>blood, as regards quantity and heat, is intermediate to the other two, 
<A NAME="482"></A>being however of purer quality than either. For it behoves the supreme 
<A NAME="483"></A>part to be as tranquil as possible, and this tranquillity can be ensured 
<A NAME="484"></A>by the blood being pure, and of moderate amount and 
<A NAME="485"></A>warmth.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>In the heart of animals there is also a kind of joint-like division, 
<A NAME="487"></A>something like the sutures of the skull. This is not, however, attributable 
<A NAME="488"></A>to the heart being formed by the union of several parts into a compound 
<A NAME="489"></A>whole, but is rather, as already said, the result of a joint-like division. 
<A NAME="490"></A>These jointings are most distinct in animals of keen sensibility, and less 
<A NAME="491"></A>so in those that are of duller feeling, in swine for instance. Different 
<A NAME="492"></A>hearts differ also from each other in their sizes, and in their degrees 
<A NAME="493"></A>of firmness; and these differences somehow extend their influence to the 
<A NAME="494"></A>temperaments of the animals. For in animals of low sensibility the heart 
<A NAME="495"></A>is hard and dense in texture, while it is softer in such as are endowed 
<A NAME="496"></A>with keener feeling. So also when the heart is of large size the animal 
<A NAME="497"></A>is timorous, while it is more courageous if the organ be smaller and of 
<A NAME="498"></A>moderate bulk. For in the former the bodily affection which results from 
<A NAME="499"></A>terror already pre-exists; for the bulk of the heart is out of all proportion 
<A NAME="500"></A>to the animal's heat, which being small is reduced to insignificance in 
<A NAME="501"></A>the large space, and thus the blood is made colder than it would otherwise 
<A NAME="502"></A>be.
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR>The heart is of large size in the hare, the deer, the mouse, the 
<A NAME="504"></A>hyena, the ass, the leopard, the marten, and in pretty nearly all other 
<A NAME="505"></A>animals that either are manifestly timorous, or betray their cowardice 
<A NAME="506"></A>by their spitefulness.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>What has been said of the heart as a whole is no less true of its 
<A NAME="508"></A>cavities and of the blood-vessels; these also if of large size being cold. 
<A NAME="509"></A>For just as a fire of equal size gives less heat in a large room than in 
<A NAME="510"></A>a small one, so also does the heat in a large cavity or a large blood-vessel, 
<A NAME="511"></A>that is in a large receptacle, have less effect than in a small one. Moreover, 
<A NAME="512"></A>all hot bodies are cooled by motions external to themselves, and the more 
<A NAME="513"></A>spacious the cavities and vessels are, the greater the amount of spirit 
<A NAME="514"></A>they contain, and the more potent its action. Thus it is that no animal 
<A NAME="515"></A>that has large cavities in its heart, or large blood-vessels, is ever fat, 
<A NAME="516"></A>the vessels being indistinct and the cavities small in all or most fat 
<A NAME="517"></A>animals.
<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>The heart again is the only one of the viscera, and indeed the 
<A NAME="519"></A>only part of the body, that is unable to tolerate any serious affection. 
<A NAME="520"></A>This is but what might reasonably be expected. For, if the primary or dominant 
<A NAME="521"></A>part be diseased, there is nothing from which the other parts which depend 
<A NAME="522"></A>upon it can derive succour. A proof that the heart is thus unable to tolerate 
<A NAME="523"></A>any morbid affection is furnished by the fact that in no sacrificial victim 
<A NAME="524"></A>has it ever been seen to be affected with those diseases that are observable 
<A NAME="525"></A>in the other viscera. For the kidneys are frequently found to be full of 
<A NAME="526"></A>stones, and growths, and small abscesses, as also are the liver, the lung, 
<A NAME="527"></A>and more than all the spleen. There are also many other morbid conditions 
<A NAME="528"></A>which are seen to occur in these parts, those which are least liable to 
<A NAME="529"></A>such being the portion of the lung which is close to the windpipe, and 
<A NAME="530"></A>the portion of the liver which lies about the junction with the great blood-vessel. 
<A NAME="531"></A>This again admits of a rational explanation. For it is in these parts that 
<A NAME="532"></A>the lung and liver are most closely in communion with the heart. On the 
<A NAME="533"></A>other hand, when animals die not by sacrifice but from disease, and from 
<A NAME="534"></A>affections such as are mentioned above, they are found on dissection to 
<A NAME="535"></A>have morbid affections of the heart.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>Thus much of the heart, its nature, and the end and cause of its 
<A NAME="537"></A>existence in such animals as have it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="538"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>In due sequence we have next to discuss the blood-vessels, that 
<A NAME="540"></A>is to say the great vessel and the aorta. For it is into these two that 
<A NAME="541"></A>the blood first passes when it quits the heart; and all the other vessels 
<A NAME="542"></A>are but offshoots from them. Now that these vessels exist on account of 
<A NAME="543"></A>the blood has already been stated. For every fluid requires a receptacle, 
<A NAME="544"></A>and in the case of the blood the vessels are that receptacle. Let us now 
<A NAME="545"></A>explain why these vessels are two, and why they spring from one single 
<A NAME="546"></A>source, and extend throughout the whole body.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>The reason, then, why these two vessels coalesce into one centre, 
<A NAME="548"></A>and spring from one source, is that the sensory soul is in all animals 
<A NAME="549"></A>actually one; and this one-ness of the sensory soul determines a corresponding 
<A NAME="550"></A>one-ness of the part in which it primarily abides. In sanguineous animals 
<A NAME="551"></A>this one-ness is not only actual but potential, whereas in some bloodless 
<A NAME="552"></A>animals it is only actual. Where, however, the sensory soul is lodged, 
<A NAME="553"></A>there also and in the selfsame place must necessarily be the source of 
<A NAME="554"></A>heat; and, again, where this is there also must be the source of the blood, 
<A NAME="555"></A>seeing that it thence derives its warmth and fluidity. Thus, then, in the 
<A NAME="556"></A>oneness of the part in which is lodged the prime source of sensation and 
<A NAME="557"></A>of heat is involved the one-ness of the source in which the blood originates; 
<A NAME="558"></A>and this, again, explains why the blood-vessels have one common 
<A NAME="559"></A>starting-point.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>The vessels, again, are two, because the body of every sanguineous 
<A NAME="561"></A>animal that is capable of locomotion is bilateral; for in all such animals 
<A NAME="562"></A>there is a distinguishable before and behind, a right and left, an above 
<A NAME="563"></A>and below. Now as the front is more honourable and of higher supremacy 
<A NAME="564"></A>than the hinder aspect, so also and in like degree is the great vessel 
<A NAME="565"></A>superior to the aorta. For the great vessel is placed in front, while the 
<A NAME="566"></A>aorta is behind; the former again is plainly visible in all sanguineous 
<A NAME="567"></A>animals, while the latter is in some indistinct and in some not discernible 
<A NAME="568"></A>at all.
<A NAME="569"></A><BR><BR>Lastly, the reason for the vessels being distributed throughout 
<A NAME="570"></A>the entire body is that in them, or in parts analogous to them, is contained 
<A NAME="571"></A>the blood, or the fluid which in bloodless animals takes the place of blood, 
<A NAME="572"></A>and that the blood or analogous fluid is the material from which the whole 
<A NAME="573"></A>body is made. Now as to the manner in which animals are nourished, and 
<A NAME="574"></A>as to the source from which they obtain nutriment and as to the way in 
<A NAME="575"></A>which they absorb this from the stomach, these are matters which may be 
<A NAME="576"></A>more suitably considered and explained in the treatise on Generation. But 
<A NAME="577"></A>inasmuch as the parts are, as already said, formed out of the blood, it 
<A NAME="578"></A>is but rational that the flow of the blood should extend, as it does, throughout 
<A NAME="579"></A>the whole of the body. For since each part is formed of blood, each must 
<A NAME="580"></A>have blood about and in its substance.
<A NAME="581"></A><BR><BR>To give an illustration of this. The water-courses in gardens are 
<A NAME="582"></A>so constructed as to distribute water from one single source or fount into 
<A NAME="583"></A>numerous channels, which divide and subdivide so as to convey it to all 
<A NAME="584"></A>parts; and, again, in house-building stones are thrown down along the whole 
<A NAME="585"></A>ground-plan of the foundation walls; because the garden-plants in the one 
<A NAME="586"></A>case grow at the expense of the water, and the foundation walls in the 
<A NAME="587"></A>other are built out of the stones. Now just after the same fashion has 
<A NAME="588"></A>nature laid down channels for the conveyance of the blood throughout the 
<A NAME="589"></A>whole body, because this blood is the material out of which the whole fabric 
<A NAME="590"></A>is made. This becomes very evident in bodies that have undergone great 
<A NAME="591"></A>emaciation. For in such there is nothing to be seen but the blood-vessels; 
<A NAME="592"></A>just as when fig-leaves or vine-leaves or the like have dried up, there 
<A NAME="593"></A>is nothing left of them but their vessels. The explanation of this is that 
<A NAME="594"></A>the blood, or fluid which takes its place, is potentially body and flesh, 
<A NAME="595"></A>or substance analogous to flesh. Now just as in irrigation the largest 
<A NAME="596"></A>dykes are permanent, while the smallest are soon filled up with mud and 
<A NAME="597"></A>disappear, again to become visible when the deposit of mud ceases; so also 
<A NAME="598"></A>do the largest blood-vessels remain permanently open, while the smallest 
<A NAME="599"></A>are converted actually into flesh, though potentially they are no whit 
<A NAME="600"></A>less vessels than before. This too explains why, so long as the flesh of 
<A NAME="601"></A>an animal is in its integrity, blood will flow from any part of it whatsoever 
<A NAME="602"></A>that is cut, though no vessel, however small, be visible in it. Yet there 
<A NAME="603"></A>can be no blood, unless there be a blood-vessel. The vessels then are there, 
<A NAME="604"></A>but are invisible owing to their being clogged up, just as the dykes for 
<A NAME="605"></A>irrigation are invisible until they have been cleared of 
<A NAME="606"></A>mud.
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>As the blood-vessels advance, they become gradually smaller and 
<A NAME="608"></A>smaller, until at last their tubes are too fine to admit the blood. This 
<A NAME="609"></A>fluid can therefore no longer find its way through them, though they still 
<A NAME="610"></A>give passage to the humour which we call sweat; and especially so when 
<A NAME="611"></A>the body is heated, and the mouths of the small vessels are dilated. Instances, 
<A NAME="612"></A>indeed, are not unknown of persons who in consequence of a cachectic state 
<A NAME="613"></A>have secreted sweat that resembled blood, their body having become loose 
<A NAME="614"></A>and flabby, and their blood watery, owing to the heat in the small vessels 
<A NAME="615"></A>having been too scanty for its concoction. For, as was before said, every 
<A NAME="616"></A>compound of earth and water-and both nutriment and blood are such-becomes 
<A NAME="617"></A>thicker from concoction. The inability of the heat to effect concoction 
<A NAME="618"></A>may be due either to its being absolutely small in amount, or to its being 
<A NAME="619"></A>small in proportion to the quantity of food, when this has been taken excess. 
<A NAME="620"></A>This excess again may be of two kinds, either quantitative or qualitative; 
<A NAME="621"></A>for all substances are not equally amenable to concoction.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>The widest passages in the body are of all parts the most liable 
<A NAME="623"></A>to haemorrhage; so that bleeding occurs not infrequently from the nostrils, 
<A NAME="624"></A>the gums, and the fundament, occasionally also from the mouth. Such haemorrhages 
<A NAME="625"></A>are of a passive kind, and not violent as are those from the 
<A NAME="626"></A>windpipe.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>The great vessel and the aorta, which above lie somewhat apart, 
<A NAME="628"></A>lower down exchange positions, and by so doing give compactness to the 
<A NAME="629"></A>body. For when they reach the point where the legs diverge, they each split 
<A NAME="630"></A>into two, and the great vessel passes from the front to the rear, and the 
<A NAME="631"></A>aorta from the rear to the front. By this they contribute to the unity 
<A NAME="632"></A>of the whole fabric. For as in plaited work the parts hold more firmly 
<A NAME="633"></A>together because of the interweaving, so also by the interchange of position 
<A NAME="634"></A>between the blood-vessels are the anterior and posterior parts of the body 
<A NAME="635"></A>more closely knit together. A similar exchange of position occurs also 
<A NAME="636"></A>in the upper part of the body, between the vessels that have issued from 
<A NAME="637"></A>the heart. The details however of the mutual relations of the different 
<A NAME="638"></A>vessels must be looked for in the treatises on Anatomy and the Researches 
<A NAME="639"></A>concerning Animals.
<A NAME="640"></A><BR><BR>So much, then, as concerns the heart and the blood-vessels. We 
<A NAME="641"></A>must now pass on to the other viscera and apply the same method of inquiry 
<A NAME="642"></A>to them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="643"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="644"></A><BR><BR>The lung, then, is an organ found in all the animals of a certain 
<A NAME="645"></A>class, because they live on land. For there must of necessity be some means 
<A NAME="646"></A>or other of tempering the heat of the body; and in sanguineous animals, 
<A NAME="647"></A>as they are of an especially hot nature, the cooling agency must be external, 
<A NAME="648"></A>whereas in the bloodless kinds the innate spirit is sufficient of itself 
<A NAME="649"></A>for the purpose. The external cooling agent must be either air or water. 
<A NAME="650"></A>In fishes the agent is water. Fishes therefore never have a lung, but have 
<A NAME="651"></A>gills in its place, as was stated in the treatise on Respiration. But animals 
<A NAME="652"></A>that breathe are cooled by air. These therefore are all provided with a 
<A NAME="653"></A>lung.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>All land animals breathe, and even some water animals, such as 
<A NAME="655"></A>the whale, the dolphin, and all the spouting Cetacea. For many animals 
<A NAME="656"></A>lie half-way between terrestrial and aquatic; some that are terrestrial 
<A NAME="657"></A>and that inspire air being nevertheless of such a bodily constitution that 
<A NAME="658"></A>they abide for the most time in the water; and some that are aquatic partaking 
<A NAME="659"></A>so largely of the land character, that respiration constitutes for them 
<A NAME="660"></A>the man condition of life.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR>The organ of respiration is the lung. This derives its motion from 
<A NAME="662"></A>the heart; but it is its own large size and spongy texture that affords 
<A NAME="663"></A>amplitude of space for entrance of the breath. For when the lung rises 
<A NAME="664"></A>up the breath streams in, and is again expelled when the lung collapses. 
<A NAME="665"></A>It has been said that the lung exists as a provision to meet the jumping 
<A NAME="666"></A>of the heart. But this is out of the question. For man is practically the 
<A NAME="667"></A>only animal whose heart presents this phenomenon of jumping, inasmuch as 
<A NAME="668"></A>he alone is influenced by hope and anticipation of the future. Moreover, 
<A NAME="669"></A>in most animals the lung is separated from the heart by a considerable 
<A NAME="670"></A>interval and lies above it, so that it can contribute nothing to mitigate 
<A NAME="671"></A>any jumping.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>The lung differs much in different animals. For in some it is of 
<A NAME="673"></A>large size and contains blood; while in others it is smaller and of spongy 
<A NAME="674"></A>texture. In the vivipara it is large and rich in blood, because of their 
<A NAME="675"></A>natural heat; while in the ovipara it is small and dry but capable of expanding 
<A NAME="676"></A>to a vast extent when inflated. Among terrestrial animals, the oviparous 
<A NAME="677"></A>quadrupeds, such as lizards, tortoises, and the like, have this kind of 
<A NAME="678"></A>lung; and, among inhabitants of the air, the animals known as birds. For 
<A NAME="679"></A>in all these the lung is spongy, and like foam. For it is membranous and 
<A NAME="680"></A>collapses from a large bulk to a small one, as does foam when it runs together. 
<A NAME="681"></A>In this too lies the explanation of the fact that these animals are little 
<A NAME="682"></A>liable to thirst and drink but sparingly, and that they are able to remain 
<A NAME="683"></A>for a considerable time under water. For, inasmuch as they have but little 
<A NAME="684"></A>heat, the very motion of the lung, airlike and void, suffices by itself 
<A NAME="685"></A>to cool them for a considerable period.
<A NAME="686"></A><BR><BR>These animals, speaking generally, are also distinguished from 
<A NAME="687"></A>others by their smaller bulk. For heat promotes growth, and abundance of 
<A NAME="688"></A>blood is a sure indication of heat. Heat, again, tends to make the body 
<A NAME="689"></A>erect; and thus it is that man is the most erect of animals, and the vivipara 
<A NAME="690"></A>more erect than other quadrupeds. For no viviparous animal, be it apodous 
<A NAME="691"></A>or be it possessed of feet, is so given to creep into holes as are the 
<A NAME="692"></A>ovipara.
<A NAME="693"></A><BR><BR>The lung, then, exists for respiration; and this is its universal 
<A NAME="694"></A>office; but in one order of animals it is bloodless and has the structure 
<A NAME="695"></A>described above, to suit the special requirements There is, however, no 
<A NAME="696"></A>one term to denote all animals that have a lung; no designation, that is, 
<A NAME="697"></A>like the term Bird, applicable to the whole of a certain class. Yet the 
<A NAME="698"></A>possession of a lung is a part of their essence, just as much as the presence 
<A NAME="699"></A>of certain characters constitutes the essence of a bird.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="700"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR>Of the viscera some appear to be single, as the heart and lung; 
<A NAME="702"></A>others to be double, as the kidneys; while of a third kind it is doubtful 
<A NAME="703"></A>in which class they should be reckoned. For the liver and the spleen would 
<A NAME="704"></A>seem to lie half-way between the single and the double organs. For they 
<A NAME="705"></A>may be regarded either as constituting each a single organ, or as a pair 
<A NAME="706"></A>of organs resembling each other in character.
<A NAME="707"></A><BR><BR>In reality, however, all the organs are double. The reason for 
<A NAME="708"></A>this is that the body itself is double, consisting of two halves, which 
<A NAME="709"></A>are however combined together under one supreme centre. For there is an 
<A NAME="710"></A>upper and a lower half, a front and a rear, a right side and a 
<A NAME="711"></A>left.
<A NAME="712"></A><BR><BR>This explains why it is that even the brain and the several organs 
<A NAME="713"></A>of sense tend in all animals to consist of two parts; and the same explanation 
<A NAME="714"></A>applies to the heart with its cavities. The lung again in Ovipara is divided 
<A NAME="715"></A>to such an extent that these animals look as though they had actually two 
<A NAME="716"></A>lungs. As to the kidneys, no one can overlook their double character. But 
<A NAME="717"></A>when we come to the liver and the spleen, any one might fairly be in doubt. 
<A NAME="718"></A>The reason of this is, that, in animals that necessarily have a spleen, 
<A NAME="719"></A>this organ is such that it might be taken for a kind of bastard liver; 
<A NAME="720"></A>while in those in which a spleen is not an actual necessity but is merely 
<A NAME="721"></A>present, as it were, by way of token, in an extremely minute form, the 
<A NAME="722"></A>liver plainly consists of two parts; of which the larger tends to lie on 
<A NAME="723"></A>the right side and the smaller on the left. Not but what there are some 
<A NAME="724"></A>even of the Ovipara in which this condition is comparatively indistinctly 
<A NAME="725"></A>marked; while, on the other hand, there are some Vivipara in which the 
<A NAME="726"></A>liver is manifestly divided into two parts. Examples of such division are 
<A NAME="727"></A>furnished by the hares of certain regions, which have the appearance of 
<A NAME="728"></A>having two livers, and by the cartilaginous and some other 
<A NAME="729"></A>fishes.
<A NAME="730"></A><BR><BR>It is the position of the liver on the right side of the body that 
<A NAME="731"></A>is the main cause for the formation of the spleen; the existence of which 
<A NAME="732"></A>thus becomes to a certain extent a matter of necessity in all animals, 
<A NAME="733"></A>though not of very stringent necessity.
<A NAME="734"></A><BR><BR>The reason, then, why the viscera are bilateral is, as we have 
<A NAME="735"></A>said, that there are two sides to the body, a right and a left. For each 
<A NAME="736"></A>of these sides aims at similarity with the other, and so likewise do their 
<A NAME="737"></A>several viscera; and as the sides, though dual, are knit together into 
<A NAME="738"></A>unity, so also do the viscera tend to be bilateral and yet one by unity 
<A NAME="739"></A>of constitution.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR>Those viscera which lie below the diaphragm exist one and all on 
<A NAME="741"></A>account of the blood-vessels; serving as a bond, by which these vessels, 
<A NAME="742"></A>while floating freely, are yet held in connexion with the body. For the 
<A NAME="743"></A>vessels give off branches which run to the body through the outstretched 
<A NAME="744"></A>structures, like so many anchorlines thrown out from a ship. The great 
<A NAME="745"></A>vessel sends such branches to the liver and the spleen; and these viscera-the 
<A NAME="746"></A>liver and spleen on either side with the kidneys behind-attach the great 
<A NAME="747"></A>vessel to the body with the firmness of nails. The aorta sends similar 
<A NAME="748"></A>branches to each kidney, but none to the liver or spleen.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR>These viscera, then, contribute in this manner to the compactness 
<A NAME="750"></A>of the animal body. The liver and spleen assist, moreover, in the concoction 
<A NAME="751"></A>of the food; for both are of a hot character, owing to the blood which 
<A NAME="752"></A>they contain. The kidneys, on the other hand, take part in the separation 
<A NAME="753"></A>of the excretion which flows into the bladder.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>The heart then and the liver are essential constituents of every 
<A NAME="755"></A>animal; the liver that it may effect concoction, the heart that it may 
<A NAME="756"></A>lodge the central source of heat. For some part or other there must be 
<A NAME="757"></A>which, like a hearth, shall hold the kindling fire; and this part must 
<A NAME="758"></A>be well protected, seeing that it is, as it were, the citadel of the 
<A NAME="759"></A>body.
<A NAME="760"></A><BR><BR>All sanguineous animals, then, need these two parts; and this explains 
<A NAME="761"></A>why these two viscera, and these two alone, are invariably found in them 
<A NAME="762"></A>all. In such of them, however, as breathe, there is also as invariably 
<A NAME="763"></A>a third, namely the lung. The spleen, on the other hand, is not invariably 
<A NAME="764"></A>present; and, in those animals that have it, is only present of necessity 
<A NAME="765"></A>in the same sense as the excretions of the belly and of the bladder are 
<A NAME="766"></A>necessary, in the sense, that is, of being an inevitable concomitant. Therefore 
<A NAME="767"></A>it is that in some animals the spleen is but scantily developed as regards 
<A NAME="768"></A>size. This, for instance, is the case in such feathered animals as have 
<A NAME="769"></A>a hot stomach. Such are the pigeon, the hawk, and the kite. It is the case 
<A NAME="770"></A>also in oviparous quadrupeds, where the spleen is excessively minute, and 
<A NAME="771"></A>in many of the scaly fishes. These same animals are also without a bladder, 
<A NAME="772"></A>because the loose texture of their flesh allows the residual fluid to pass 
<A NAME="773"></A>through and to be applied to the formation of feathers and scales. For 
<A NAME="774"></A>the spleen attracts the residual humours from the stomach, and owing to 
<A NAME="775"></A>its bloodlike character is enabled to assist in their concoction. Should, 
<A NAME="776"></A>however, this residual fluid be too abundant, or the heat of the spleen 
<A NAME="777"></A>be too scanty, the body becomes sickly from over-repletion with nutriment. 
<A NAME="778"></A>Often, too, when the spleen is affected by disease, the belly becomes hard 
<A NAME="779"></A>owing to the reflux into it of the fluid; just as happens to those who 
<A NAME="780"></A>form too much urine, for they also are liable to a similar diversion of 
<A NAME="781"></A>the fluids into the belly. But in those animals that have but little superfluous 
<A NAME="782"></A>fluid to excrete, such as birds and fishes, the spleen is never large, 
<A NAME="783"></A>and in some exists no more than by way of token. So also in the oviparous 
<A NAME="784"></A>quadrupeds it is small, compact, and like a kidney. For their lung is spongy, 
<A NAME="785"></A>and they drink but little, and such superfluous fluid as they have is applied 
<A NAME="786"></A>to the growth of the body and the formation of scaly plates, just as in 
<A NAME="787"></A>birds it is applied to the formation of feathers.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR>On the other hand, in such animals as have a bladder, and whose 
<A NAME="789"></A>lung contains blood, the spleen is watery, both for the reason already 
<A NAME="790"></A>mentioned, and also because the left side of the body is more watery and 
<A NAME="791"></A>colder than the right. For each of two contraries has been so placed as 
<A NAME="792"></A>to go together with that which is akin to it in another pair of contraries. 
<A NAME="793"></A>Thus right and left, hot and cold, are pairs of contraries; and right is 
<A NAME="794"></A>conjoined with hot, after the manner described, and left with 
<A NAME="795"></A>cold.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR><BR>The kidneys when they are present exist not of actual necessity, 
<A NAME="797"></A>but as matters of greater finish and perfection. For by their special character 
<A NAME="798"></A>they are suited to serve in the excretion of the fluid which collects in 
<A NAME="799"></A>the bladder. In animals therefore where this fluid is very abundantly formed, 
<A NAME="800"></A>their presence enables the bladder to perform its proper office with greater 
<A NAME="801"></A>perfection.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>Since then both kidneys and bladder exist in animals for one and 
<A NAME="803"></A>the same function, we must next treat of the bladder, though in so doing 
<A NAME="804"></A>we disregard the due order of succession in which the parts should be enumerated. 
<A NAME="805"></A>For not a word has yet been said of the midriff, which is one of the parts 
<A NAME="806"></A>that environ the viscera and therefore has to be considered with 
<A NAME="807"></A>them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="808"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="809"></A><BR><BR>It is not every animal that has a bladder; those only being apparently 
<A NAME="810"></A>intended by nature to have one, whose lung contains blood. To such it was 
<A NAME="811"></A>but reasonable that she should give this part. For the superabundance in 
<A NAME="812"></A>their lung of its natural constituents causes them to be the thirstiest 
<A NAME="813"></A>of animals, and makes them require a more than ordinary quantity not merely 
<A NAME="814"></A>of solid but also of liquid nutriment. This increased consumption necessarily 
<A NAME="815"></A>entails the production of an increased amount of residue; which thus becomes 
<A NAME="816"></A>too abundant to be concocted by the stomach and excreted with its own residual 
<A NAME="817"></A>matter. The residual fluid must therefore of necessity have a receptacle 
<A NAME="818"></A>of its own; and thus it comes to pass that all animals whose lung contains 
<A NAME="819"></A>blood are provided with a bladder. Those animals, on the other hand, that 
<A NAME="820"></A>are without a lung of this character, and that either drink but sparingly 
<A NAME="821"></A>owing to their lung being of a spongy texture, or never imbibe fluid at 
<A NAME="822"></A>all for drinking's sake but only as nutriment, insects for instance and 
<A NAME="823"></A>fishes, and that are moreover clad with feathers or scales or scaly plates-all 
<A NAME="824"></A>these animals, owing to the small amount of fluid which they imbibe, and 
<A NAME="825"></A>owing also to such residue as there may be being converted into feathers 
<A NAME="826"></A>and the like, are invariably without a bladder. The Tortoises, which are 
<A NAME="827"></A>comprised among animals with scaly plates, form the only exception; and 
<A NAME="828"></A>this is merely due to the imperfect development of their natural conformation; 
<A NAME="829"></A>the explanation of the matter being that in the sea-tortoises the lung 
<A NAME="830"></A>is flesh-like and contains blood, resembling the lung of the ox, and that 
<A NAME="831"></A>in the land-tortoises it is of disproportionately large size. Moreover, 
<A NAME="832"></A>inasmuch as the covering which invests them is dense and shell-like, so 
<A NAME="833"></A>that the moisture cannot exhale through the porous flesh, as it does in 
<A NAME="834"></A>birds and in snakes and other animals with scaly plates, such an amount 
<A NAME="835"></A>of secretion is formed that some special part is required to receive and 
<A NAME="836"></A>hold it. This then is the reason why these animals, alone of their kind, 
<A NAME="837"></A>have a bladder, the sea-tortoise a large one, the land-tortoises an extremely 
<A NAME="838"></A>small one.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="839"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR>What has been said of the bladder is equally true of the kidneys. 
<A NAME="841"></A>For these also are wanting in all animals that are clad with feathers or 
<A NAME="842"></A>with scales or with scale-like plates; the sea and land tortoises forming 
<A NAME="843"></A>the only exception. In some of the birds, however, there are flattened 
<A NAME="844"></A>kidney like bodies, as though the flesh allotted to the formation of the 
<A NAME="845"></A>kidneys, unable to find one single place of sufficient size, had been scattered 
<A NAME="846"></A>over several.
<A NAME="847"></A><BR><BR>The Emys has neither bladder nor kidneys. For the softness of its 
<A NAME="848"></A>shell allows of the ready transpiration of fluid; and for this reason neither 
<A NAME="849"></A>of the organs mentioned exists in this animal. All other animals, however, 
<A NAME="850"></A>whose lung contains blood are, as before said, provided with kidneys. For 
<A NAME="851"></A>nature uses these organs for two separate purposes, namely for the excretion 
<A NAME="852"></A>of the residual fluid, and to subserve the blood-vessels, a channel leading 
<A NAME="853"></A>to them from the great vessel.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><BR>In the centre of the kidney is a cavity of variable size. This 
<A NAME="855"></A>is the case in all animals, excepting the seal. The kidneys of this animal 
<A NAME="856"></A>are more solid than those of any other, and in form resemble the kidneys 
<A NAME="857"></A>of the ox. The human kidneys are of similar shape; being as it were made 
<A NAME="858"></A>up of numerous small kidneys, and not presenting one unbroken surface like 
<A NAME="859"></A>the kidneys of sheep and other quadrupeds. For this reason, should the 
<A NAME="860"></A>kidneys of a man be once attacked by disease, the malady is not easily 
<A NAME="861"></A>expelled. For it is as though many kidneys were diseased and not merely 
<A NAME="862"></A>one; which naturally enhances the difficulties of a 
<A NAME="863"></A>cure.
<A NAME="864"></A><BR><BR>The duct which runs to the kidney from the great vessel does not 
<A NAME="865"></A>terminate in the central cavity, but is expended on the substance of the 
<A NAME="866"></A>organ, so that there is no blood in the cavity, nor is any coagulum found 
<A NAME="867"></A>there after death. A pair of stout ducts, void of blood, run, one from 
<A NAME="868"></A>the cavity of each kidney, to the bladder; and other ducts, strong and 
<A NAME="869"></A>continuous, lead into the kidneys from the aorta. The purpose of this arrangement 
<A NAME="870"></A>is to allow the superfluous fluid to pass from the blood-vessel into the 
<A NAME="871"></A>kidney, and the resulting renal excretion to collect by the percolation 
<A NAME="872"></A>of the fluid through the solid substance of the organ, in its centre, where 
<A NAME="873"></A>as a general rule there is a cavity. (This by the way explains why the 
<A NAME="874"></A>kidney is the most ill-savoured of all the viscera.) From the central cavity 
<A NAME="875"></A>the fluid is discharged into the bladder by the ducts that have been mentioned, 
<A NAME="876"></A>having already assumed in great degree the character of excremental residue. 
<A NAME="877"></A>The bladder is as it were moored to the kidneys; for, as already has been 
<A NAME="878"></A>stated, it is attached to them by strong ducts. These then are the purposes 
<A NAME="879"></A>for which the kidneys exist, and such the functions of these 
<A NAME="880"></A>organs.
<A NAME="881"></A><BR><BR>In all animals that have kidneys, that on the right is placed higher 
<A NAME="882"></A>than that on the left. For inasmuch as motion commences from the right, 
<A NAME="883"></A>and the organs on this side are in consequence stronger than those on the 
<A NAME="884"></A>left, they must all push upwards in advance of their opposite fellows; 
<A NAME="885"></A>as may be seen in the fact that men even raise the right eyebrow more than 
<A NAME="886"></A>the left, and that the former is more arched than the latter. The right 
<A NAME="887"></A>kidney being thus drawn upwards is in all animals brought into contact 
<A NAME="888"></A>with the liver; for the liver lies on the right side.
<A NAME="889"></A><BR><BR>Of all the viscera the kidneys are those that have the most fat. 
<A NAME="890"></A>This is in the first place the result of necessity, because the kidneys 
<A NAME="891"></A>are the parts through which the residual matters percolate. For the blood 
<A NAME="892"></A>which is left behind after this excretion, being of pure quality, is of 
<A NAME="893"></A>easy concoction, and the final result of thorough blood-concoction is lard 
<A NAME="894"></A>and suet. For just as a certain amount of fire is left in the ashes of 
<A NAME="895"></A>solid substances after combustion, so also does a remnant of the heat that 
<A NAME="896"></A>has been developed remain in fluids after concoction; and this is the reason 
<A NAME="897"></A>why oily matter is light, and floats on the surface of other fluids. The 
<A NAME="898"></A>fat is not formed in the kidneys themselves, the density of their substance 
<A NAME="899"></A>forbidding this, but is deposited about their external surface. It consists 
<A NAME="900"></A>of lard or of suet, according as the animal's fat is of the former or latter 
<A NAME="901"></A>character. The difference between these two kinds of fat has already been 
<A NAME="902"></A>set forth in other passages. The formation, then, of fat in the kidneys 
<A NAME="903"></A>is the result of necessity; being, as explained, a consequence of the necessary 
<A NAME="904"></A>conditions which accompany the possession of such organs. But at the same 
<A NAME="905"></A>time the fat has a final cause, namely to ensure the safety of the kidneys, 
<A NAME="906"></A>and to maintain their natural heat. For placed, as these organs are, close 
<A NAME="907"></A>to the surface, they require a greater supply of heat than other parts. 
<A NAME="908"></A>For while the back is thickly covered with flesh, so as to form a shield 
<A NAME="909"></A>for the heart and neighbouring viscera, the loins, in accordance with a 
<A NAME="910"></A>rule that applies to all bendings, are destitute of flesh; and fat is therefore 
<A NAME="911"></A>formed as a substitute for it, so that the kidneys may not be without protection. 
<A NAME="912"></A>The kidneys, moreover, by being fat are the better enabled to secrete and 
<A NAME="913"></A>concoct their fluid; for fat is hot, and it is heat that effects 
<A NAME="914"></A>concoction.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR><BR>Such, then, are the reasons why the kidneys are fat. But in all 
<A NAME="916"></A>animals the right kidney is less fat than its fellow. The reason for this 
<A NAME="917"></A>is, that the parts on the right side are naturally more solid and more 
<A NAME="918"></A>suited for motion than those on the left. But motion is antagonistic to 
<A NAME="919"></A>fat, for it tends to melt it.
<A NAME="920"></A><BR><BR>Animals then, as a general rule, derive advantage from their kidneys 
<A NAME="921"></A>being fat; and the fat is often very abundant and extends over the whole 
<A NAME="922"></A>of these organs. But, should the like occur in the sheep, death ensues. 
<A NAME="923"></A>Be its kidneys, however, as fat as they may, they are never so fat but 
<A NAME="924"></A>that some part, if not in both at any rate in the right one, is left free. 
<A NAME="925"></A>The reason why sheep are the only animals that suffer in this manner, or 
<A NAME="926"></A>suffer more than others, is that in animals whose fat is composed of lard 
<A NAME="927"></A>this is of fluid consistency, so that there is not the same chance in their 
<A NAME="928"></A>case of wind getting shut in and causing mischief. But it is to such an 
<A NAME="929"></A>enclosure of wind that rot is due. And thus even in men, though it is beneficial 
<A NAME="930"></A>to them to have fat kidneys, yet should these organs become over-fat and 
<A NAME="931"></A>diseased, deadly pains ensue. As to those animals whose fat consists of 
<A NAME="932"></A>suet, in none is the suet so dense as in the sheep, neither is it nearly 
<A NAME="933"></A>so abundant; for of all animals there is none in which the kidneys become 
<A NAME="934"></A>so soon gorged with fat as in the sheep. Rot, then, is produced by the 
<A NAME="935"></A>moisture and the wind getting shut up in the kidneys, and is a malady that 
<A NAME="936"></A>carries off sheep with great rapidity. For the disease forthwith reaches 
<A NAME="937"></A>the heart, passing thither by the aorta and the great vessel, the ducts 
<A NAME="938"></A>which connect these with the kidneys being of unbroken 
<A NAME="939"></A>continuity.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="940"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="941"></A><BR><BR>We have now dealt with the heart and the lung, as also with the 
<A NAME="942"></A>liver, spleen, and kidneys. The latter are separated from the former by 
<A NAME="943"></A>the midriff or, as some call it, the Phrenes. This divides off the heart 
<A NAME="944"></A>and lung, and, as already said, is called Phrenes in sanguineous animals, 
<A NAME="945"></A>all of which have a midriff, just as they all have a heart and a liver. 
<A NAME="946"></A>For they require a midriff to divide the region of the heart from the region 
<A NAME="947"></A>of the stomach, so that the centre wherein abides the sensory soul may 
<A NAME="948"></A>be undisturbed, and not be overwhelmed, directly food is taken, by its 
<A NAME="949"></A>up-steaming vapour and by the abundance of heat then superinduced. For 
<A NAME="950"></A>it was to guard against this that nature made a division, constructing 
<A NAME="951"></A>the midriff as a kind of partition-wall and fence, and so separated the 
<A NAME="952"></A>nobler from the less noble parts, in all cases where a separation of upper 
<A NAME="953"></A>from lower is possible. For the upper part is the more honourable, and 
<A NAME="954"></A>is that for the sake of which the rest exists; while the lower part exists 
<A NAME="955"></A>for the sake of the upper and constitutes the necessary element in the 
<A NAME="956"></A>body, inasmuch as it is the recipient of the food.
<A NAME="957"></A><BR><BR>That portion of the midriff which is near the ribs is fleshier 
<A NAME="958"></A>and stronger than the rest, but the central part has more of a membranous 
<A NAME="959"></A>character; for this structure conduces best to its strength and its extensibility. 
<A NAME="960"></A>Now that the midriff, which is a kind of outgrowth from the sides of the 
<A NAME="961"></A>thorax, acts as a screen to prevent heat mounting up from below, is shown 
<A NAME="962"></A>by what happens, should it, owing to its proximity to the stomach, attract 
<A NAME="963"></A>thence the hot and residual fluid. For when this occurs there ensues forthwith 
<A NAME="964"></A>a marked disturbance of intellect and of sensation. It is indeed because 
<A NAME="965"></A>of this that the midriff is called Phrenes, as though it had some share 
<A NAME="966"></A>in the process of thinking (Phronein). in reality, however, it has no part 
<A NAME="967"></A>whatsoever itself in the matter, but, lying in close proximity to organs 
<A NAME="968"></A>that have, it brings about the manifest changes of intelligence in question 
<A NAME="969"></A>by acting upon them. This too explains why its central part is thin. For 
<A NAME="970"></A>though this is in some measure the result of necessity, inasmuch as those 
<A NAME="971"></A>portions of the fleshy whole which lie nearest to the ribs must necessarily 
<A NAME="972"></A>be fleshier than the rest, yet besides this there is a final cause, namely 
<A NAME="973"></A>to give it as small a proportion of humour as possible; for, had it been 
<A NAME="974"></A>made of flesh throughout, it would have been more likely to attract and 
<A NAME="975"></A>hold a large amount of this. That heating of it affects sensation rapidly 
<A NAME="976"></A>and in a notable manner is shown by the phenomena of laughing. For when 
<A NAME="977"></A>men are tickled they are quickly set a-laughing, because the motion quickly 
<A NAME="978"></A>reaches this part, and heating it though but slightly nevertheless manifestly 
<A NAME="979"></A>so disturbs the mental action as to occasion movements that are independent 
<A NAME="980"></A>of the will. That man alone is affected by tickling is due firstly to the 
<A NAME="981"></A>delicacy of his skin, and secondly to his being the only animal that laughs. 
<A NAME="982"></A>For to be tickled is to be set in laughter, the laughter being produced 
<A NAME="983"></A>such a motion as mentioned of the region of the armpit.
<A NAME="984"></A><BR><BR>It is said also that when men in battle are wounded anywhere near 
<A NAME="985"></A>the midriff, they are seen to laugh, owing to the heat produced by the 
<A NAME="986"></A>wound. This may possibly be the case. At any rate it is a statement made 
<A NAME="987"></A>by much more credible persons than those who tell the story of the human 
<A NAME="988"></A>head, how it speaks after it is cut off. For so some assert, and even call 
<A NAME="989"></A>in Homer to support them, representing him as alluding to this when he 
<A NAME="990"></A>wrote, 'His head still speaking rolled into the dust,' instead of 'The 
<A NAME="991"></A>head of the speaker'. So fully was the possibility of such an occurrence 
<A NAME="992"></A>accepted in Caria, that one of that country was actually brought to trial 
<A NAME="993"></A>under the following circumstances. The priest of Zeus Hoplosmios had been 
<A NAME="994"></A>murdered; but as yet it had not been ascertained who was the assassin; 
<A NAME="995"></A>when certain persons asserted that they had heard the murdered man's head, 
<A NAME="996"></A>which had been severed from the body, repeat several times the words, 'Cercidas 
<A NAME="997"></A>slew man on mam.' Search was thereupon made and a man of those parts who 
<A NAME="998"></A>bore the name of Cercidas hunted out and put upon his trial. But it is 
<A NAME="999"></A>impossible that any one should utter a word when the windpipe is severed 
<A NAME="1000"></A>and no motion any longer derived from the lung. Moreover, among the Barbarians, 
<A NAME="1001"></A>where heads are chopped off with great rapidity, nothing of the kind has 
<A NAME="1002"></A>ever yet occurred. Why, again, does not the like occur in the case of other 
<A NAME="1003"></A>animals than man? For that none of them should laugh, when their midriff 
<A NAME="1004"></A>is wounded, is but what one would expect; for no animal but man ever laughs. 
<A NAME="1005"></A>So, too, there is nothing irrational in supposing that the trunk may run 
<A NAME="1006"></A>forwards to a certain distance after the head has been cut seeing that 
<A NAME="1007"></A>bloodless animals at any rate can live, and that for a considerable time, 
<A NAME="1008"></A>after decapitation, as has been set forth and explained in other 
<A NAME="1009"></A>passages.
<A NAME="1010"></A><BR><BR>The purposes, then, for which the viscera severally exist have 
<A NAME="1011"></A>now been stated. It is of necessity upon the inner terminations of the 
<A NAME="1012"></A>vessels that they are developed; for humour, and that of a bloody character, 
<A NAME="1013"></A>cannot but exude at these points, and it is of this, solidified and coagulated, 
<A NAME="1014"></A>that the substance of the viscera is formed. Thus they are of a bloody 
<A NAME="1015"></A>character, and in substance resemble each other while they differ from 
<A NAME="1016"></A>other parts.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1017"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="1018"></A><BR><BR>The viscera are enclosed each in a membrane. For they require some 
<A NAME="1019"></A>covering to protect them from injury, and require, moreover, that this 
<A NAME="1020"></A>covering shall be light. To such requirements membrane is well adapted; 
<A NAME="1021"></A>for it is close in texture so as to form a good protection, destitute of 
<A NAME="1022"></A>flesh so as neither to attract humour nor retain it, and thin so as to 
<A NAME="1023"></A>be light and not add to the weight of the body. Of the membranes those 
<A NAME="1024"></A>are the stoutest and strongest which invest the heart and the brain; as 
<A NAME="1025"></A>is but consistent with reason. For these are the parts which require most 
<A NAME="1026"></A>protection, seeing that they are the main governing powers of life, and 
<A NAME="1027"></A>that it is to governing powers that guard is due.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1028"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="1029"></A><BR><BR>Some animals have all the viscera that have been enumerated; others 
<A NAME="1030"></A>have only some of them. In what kind of animals this latter is the case, 
<A NAME="1031"></A>and what is the explanation, has already been stated. Moreover, the self-same 
<A NAME="1032"></A>viscera present differences in different possessors. For the heart is not 
<A NAME="1033"></A>precisely alike in all animals that have one; nor, in fact, is any viscus 
<A NAME="1034"></A>whatsoever. Thus the liver is in some animals split into several parts, 
<A NAME="1035"></A>while in others it is comparatively undivided. Such differences in its 
<A NAME="1036"></A>form present themselves even among those sanguineous animals that are viviparous, 
<A NAME="1037"></A>but are more marked in fishes and in the oviparous quadrupeds, and this 
<A NAME="1038"></A>whether we compare them with each other or with the Vivipara. As for birds, 
<A NAME="1039"></A>their liver very nearly resembles that of the Vivipara; for in them, as 
<A NAME="1040"></A>in these, it is of a pure and blood-like colour. The reason of this is 
<A NAME="1041"></A>that the body in both these classes of animals admits of the freest exhalation, 
<A NAME="1042"></A>so that the amount of foul residual matter within is but small. Hence it 
<A NAME="1043"></A>is that some of the Vivipara are without any gall-bladder at all. For the 
<A NAME="1044"></A>liver takes a large share in maintaining the purity of composition and 
<A NAME="1045"></A>the healthiness of the body. For these are conditions that depend finally 
<A NAME="1046"></A>and in the main upon the blood, and there is more blood in the liver than 
<A NAME="1047"></A>in any of the other viscera, the heart only excepted. On the other hand, 
<A NAME="1048"></A>the liver of oviparous quadrupeds and fishes inclines, as a rule, to a 
<A NAME="1049"></A>yellow hue, and there are even some of them in which it is entirely of 
<A NAME="1050"></A>this bad colour, in accordance with the bad composition of their bodies 
<A NAME="1051"></A>generally. Such, for instance, is the case in the toad, the tortoise, and 
<A NAME="1052"></A>other similar animals.
<A NAME="1053"></A><BR><BR>The spleen, again, varies in different animals. For in those that 
<A NAME="1054"></A>have horns and cloven hoofs, such as the goat, the sheep, and the like, 
<A NAME="1055"></A>it is of a rounded form; excepting when increased size has caused some 
<A NAME="1056"></A>part of it to extend its growth longitudinally, as has happened in the 
<A NAME="1057"></A>case of the ox. On the other hand, it is elongated in all polydactylous 
<A NAME="1058"></A>animals. Such, for instance, is the case in the pig, in man, and in the 
<A NAME="1059"></A>dog. While in animals with solid hoofs it is of a form intermediate to 
<A NAME="1060"></A>these two, being broad in one part, narrow in another. Such, for example, 
<A NAME="1061"></A>is its shape in the horse, the mule, and the ass.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1062"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="1063"></A><BR><BR>The viscera differ from the flesh not only in the turgid aspect 
<A NAME="1064"></A>of their substance, but also in position; for they lie within the body, 
<A NAME="1065"></A>whereas the flesh is placed on the outside. The explanation of this is 
<A NAME="1066"></A>that these parts partake of the character of blood-vessels, and that while 
<A NAME="1067"></A>the former exist for the sake of the vessels, the latter cannot exist without 
<A NAME="1068"></A>them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1069"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="1070"></A><BR><BR>Below the midriff lies the stomach, placed at the end of the oesophagus 
<A NAME="1071"></A>when there is one, and in immediate contiguity with the mouth when the 
<A NAME="1072"></A>oesophagus is wanting. Continuous with this stomach is what is called the 
<A NAME="1073"></A>gut. These parts are present in all animals, for reasons that are self-evident. 
<A NAME="1074"></A>For it is a matter of necessity that an animal shall receive the incoming 
<A NAME="1075"></A>food; and necessary also that it shall discharge the same when its goodness 
<A NAME="1076"></A>is exhausted. This residual matter, again, must not occupy the same place 
<A NAME="1077"></A>as the yet unconcocted nutriment. For as the ingress of food and the discharge 
<A NAME="1078"></A>of the residue occur at distinct periods, so also must they necessarily 
<A NAME="1079"></A>occur in distinct places. Thus there must be one receptacle for the ingoing 
<A NAME="1080"></A>food and another for the useless residue, and between these, therefore, 
<A NAME="1081"></A>a part in which the change from one condition to the other may be effected. 
<A NAME="1082"></A>These, however, are matters which will be more suitably set forth when 
<A NAME="1083"></A>we come to deal with Generation and Nutrition. What we have at present 
<A NAME="1084"></A>to consider are the variations presented by the stomach and its subsidiary 
<A NAME="1085"></A>parts. For neither in size nor in shape are these parts uniformly alike 
<A NAME="1086"></A>in all animals. Thus the stomach is single in all such sanguineous and 
<A NAME="1087"></A>viviparous animals as have teeth in front of both jaws. It is single therefore 
<A NAME="1088"></A>in all the polydactylous kinds, such as man, dog, lion, and the rest; in 
<A NAME="1089"></A>all the solid-hoofed animals also, such as horse, mule, ass; and in all 
<A NAME="1090"></A>those which, like the pig, though their hoof is cloven, yet have front 
<A NAME="1091"></A>teeth in both jaws. When, however, an animal is of large size, and feeds 
<A NAME="1092"></A>on substances of so thorny and ligneous a character as to be difficult 
<A NAME="1093"></A>of concoction, it may in consequence have several stomachs, as for instance 
<A NAME="1094"></A>is the case with the camel. A similar multiplicity of stomachs exists also 
<A NAME="1095"></A>in the horned animals; the reason being that horn-bearing animals have 
<A NAME="1096"></A>no front teeth in the upper jaw. The camel also, though it has no horns, 
<A NAME="1097"></A>is yet without upper front teeth. The explanatio
