<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Of things that exist, some exist by nature, some from other 
<A NAME="12"></A>causes.
<A NAME="13"></A><BR>'By nature' the animals and their parts exist, and the plants and the 
<A NAME="14"></A>simple bodies (earth, fire, air, water)-for we say that these and the like 
<A NAME="15"></A>exist 'by nature'.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>All the things mentioned present a feature in which they differ 
<A NAME="17"></A>from things which are not constituted by nature. Each of them has within 
<A NAME="18"></A>itself a principle of motion and of stationariness (in respect of place, 
<A NAME="19"></A>or of growth and decrease, or by way of alteration). On the other hand, 
<A NAME="20"></A>a bed and a coat and anything else of that sort, qua receiving these designations 
<A NAME="21"></A>i.e. in so far as they are products of art-have no innate impulse to change. 
<A NAME="22"></A>But in so far as they happen to be composed of stone or of earth or of 
<A NAME="23"></A>a mixture of the two, they do have such an impulse, and just to that extent 
<A NAME="24"></A>which seems to indicate that nature is a source or cause of being moved 
<A NAME="25"></A>and of being at rest in that to which it belongs primarily, in virtue of 
<A NAME="26"></A>itself and not in virtue of a concomitant attribute.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>I say 'not in virtue of a concomitant attribute', because (for 
<A NAME="28"></A>instance) a man who is a doctor might cure himself. Nevertheless it is 
<A NAME="29"></A>not in so far as he is a patient that he possesses the art of medicine: 
<A NAME="30"></A>it merely has happened that the same man is doctor and patient-and that 
<A NAME="31"></A>is why these attributes are not always found together. So it is with all 
<A NAME="32"></A>other artificial products. None of them has in itself the source of its 
<A NAME="33"></A>own production. But while in some cases (for instance houses and the other 
<A NAME="34"></A>products of manual labour) that principle is in something else external 
<A NAME="35"></A>to the thing, in others those which may cause a change in themselves in 
<A NAME="36"></A>virtue of a concomitant attribute-it lies in the things themselves (but 
<A NAME="37"></A>not in virtue of what they are).
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>'Nature' then is what has been stated. Things 'have a nature'which 
<A NAME="39"></A>have a principle of this kind. Each of them is a substance; for it is a 
<A NAME="40"></A>subject, and nature always implies a subject in which it 
<A NAME="41"></A>inheres.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>The term 'according to nature' is applied to all these things and 
<A NAME="43"></A>also to the attributes which belong to them in virtue of what they are, 
<A NAME="44"></A>for instance the property of fire to be carried upwards-which is not a 
<A NAME="45"></A>'nature' nor 'has a nature' but is 'by nature' or 'according to 
<A NAME="46"></A>nature'.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>What nature is, then, and the meaning of the terms 'by nature' 
<A NAME="48"></A>and 'according to nature', has been stated. That nature exists, it would 
<A NAME="49"></A>be absurd to try to prove; for it is obvious that there are many things 
<A NAME="50"></A>of this kind, and to prove what is obvious by what is not is the mark of 
<A NAME="51"></A>a man who is unable to distinguish what is self-evident from what is not. 
<A NAME="52"></A>(This state of mind is clearly possible. A man blind from birth might reason 
<A NAME="53"></A>about colours. Presumably therefore such persons must be talking about 
<A NAME="54"></A>words without any thought to correspond.)
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>Some identify the nature or substance of a natural object with 
<A NAME="56"></A>that immediate constituent of it which taken by itself is without arrangement, 
<A NAME="57"></A>e.g. the wood is the 'nature' of the bed, and the bronze the 'nature' of 
<A NAME="58"></A>the statue.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>As an indication of this Antiphon points out that if you planted 
<A NAME="60"></A>a bed and the rotting wood acquired the power of sending up a shoot, it 
<A NAME="61"></A>would not be a bed that would come up, but wood-which shows that the arrangement 
<A NAME="62"></A>in accordance with the rules of the art is merely an incidental attribute, 
<A NAME="63"></A>whereas the real nature is the other, which, further, persists continuously 
<A NAME="64"></A>through the process of making.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>But if the material of each of these objects has itself the same 
<A NAME="66"></A>relation to something else, say bronze (or gold) to water, bones (or wood) 
<A NAME="67"></A>to earth and so on, that (they say) would be their nature and essence. 
<A NAME="68"></A>Consequently some assert earth, others fire or air or water or some or 
<A NAME="69"></A>all of these, to be the nature of the things that are. For whatever any 
<A NAME="70"></A>one of them supposed to have this character-whether one thing or more than 
<A NAME="71"></A>one thing-this or these he declared to be the whole of substance, all else 
<A NAME="72"></A>being its affections, states, or dispositions. Every such thing they held 
<A NAME="73"></A>to be eternal (for it could not pass into anything else), but other things 
<A NAME="74"></A>to come into being and cease to be times without number.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>This then is one account of 'nature', namely that it is the immediate 
<A NAME="76"></A>material substratum of things which have in themselves a principle of motion 
<A NAME="77"></A>or change.
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>Another account is that 'nature' is the shape or form which is 
<A NAME="79"></A>specified in the definition of the thing.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>For the word 'nature' is applied to what is according to nature 
<A NAME="81"></A>and the natural in the same way as 'art' is applied to what is artistic 
<A NAME="82"></A>or a work of art. We should not say in the latter case that there is anything 
<A NAME="83"></A>artistic about a thing, if it is a bed only potentially, not yet having 
<A NAME="84"></A>the form of a bed; nor should we call it a work of art. The same is true 
<A NAME="85"></A>of natural compounds. What is potentially flesh or bone has not yet its 
<A NAME="86"></A>own 'nature', and does not exist until it receives the form specified in 
<A NAME="87"></A>the definition, which we name in defining what flesh or bone is. Thus in 
<A NAME="88"></A>the second sense of 'nature' it would be the shape or form (not separable 
<A NAME="89"></A>except in statement) of things which have in themselves a source of motion. 
<A NAME="90"></A>(The combination of the two, e.g. man, is not 'nature' but 'by nature' 
<A NAME="91"></A>or 'natural'.)
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>The form indeed is 'nature' rather than the matter; for a thing 
<A NAME="93"></A>is more properly said to be what it is when it has attained to fulfilment 
<A NAME="94"></A>than when it exists potentially. Again man is born from man, but not bed 
<A NAME="95"></A>from bed. That is why people say that the figure is not the nature of a 
<A NAME="96"></A>bed, but the wood is-if the bed sprouted not a bed but wood would come 
<A NAME="97"></A>up. But even if the figure is art, then on the same principle the shape 
<A NAME="98"></A>of man is his nature. For man is born from man.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>We also speak of a thing's nature as being exhibited in the process 
<A NAME="100"></A>of growth by which its nature is attained. The 'nature' in this sense is 
<A NAME="101"></A>not like 'doctoring', which leads not to the art of doctoring but to health. 
<A NAME="102"></A>Doctoring must start from the art, not lead to it. But it is not in this 
<A NAME="103"></A>way that nature (in the one sense) is related to nature (in the other). 
<A NAME="104"></A>What grows qua growing grows from something into something. Into what then 
<A NAME="105"></A>does it grow? Not into that from which it arose but into that to which 
<A NAME="106"></A>it tends. The shape then is nature.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>'Shape' and 'nature', it should be added, are in two senses. For 
<A NAME="108"></A>the privation too is in a way form. But whether in unqualified coming to 
<A NAME="109"></A>be there is privation, i.e. a contrary to what comes to be, we must consider 
<A NAME="110"></A>later.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="111"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>We have distinguished, then, the different ways in which the term 
<A NAME="113"></A>'nature' is used.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>The next point to consider is how the mathematician differs from 
<A NAME="115"></A>the physicist. Obviously physical bodies contain surfaces and volumes, 
<A NAME="116"></A>lines and points, and these are the subject-matter of 
<A NAME="117"></A>mathematics.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>Further, is astronomy different from physics or a department of 
<A NAME="119"></A>it? It seems absurd that the physicist should be supposed to know the nature 
<A NAME="120"></A>of sun or moon, but not to know any of their essential attributes, particularly 
<A NAME="121"></A>as the writers on physics obviously do discuss their shape also and whether 
<A NAME="122"></A>the earth and the world are spherical or not.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>Now the mathematician, though he too treats of these things, nevertheless 
<A NAME="124"></A>does not treat of them as the limits of a physical body; nor does he consider 
<A NAME="125"></A>the attributes indicated as the attributes of such bodies. That is why 
<A NAME="126"></A>he separates them; for in thought they are separable from motion, and it 
<A NAME="127"></A>makes no difference, nor does any falsity result, if they are separated. 
<A NAME="128"></A>The holders of the theory of Forms do the same, though they are not aware 
<A NAME="129"></A>of it; for they separate the objects of physics, which are less separable 
<A NAME="130"></A>than those of mathematics. This becomes plain if one tries to state in 
<A NAME="131"></A>each of the two cases the definitions of the things and of their attributes. 
<A NAME="132"></A>'Odd' and 'even', 'straight' and 'curved', and likewise 'number', 'line', 
<A NAME="133"></A>and 'figure', do not involve motion; not so 'flesh' and 'bone' and 'man'-these 
<A NAME="134"></A>are defined like 'snub nose', not like 'curved'.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>Similar evidence is supplied by the more physical of the branches 
<A NAME="136"></A>of mathematics, such as optics, harmonics, and astronomy. These are in 
<A NAME="137"></A>a way the converse of geometry. While geometry investigates physical lines 
<A NAME="138"></A>but not qua physical, optics investigates mathematical lines, but qua physical, 
<A NAME="139"></A>not qua mathematical.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>Since 'nature' has two senses, the form and the matter, we must 
<A NAME="141"></A>investigate its objects as we would the essence of snubness. That is, such 
<A NAME="142"></A>things are neither independent of matter nor can be defined in terms of 
<A NAME="143"></A>matter only. Here too indeed one might raise a difficulty. Since there 
<A NAME="144"></A>are two natures, with which is the physicist concerned? Or should he investigate 
<A NAME="145"></A>the combination of the two? But if the combination of the two, then also 
<A NAME="146"></A>each severally. Does it belong then to the same or to different sciences 
<A NAME="147"></A>to know each severally?
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>If we look at the ancients, physics would to be concerned with 
<A NAME="149"></A>the matter. (It was only very slightly that Empedocles and Democritus touched 
<A NAME="150"></A>on the forms and the essence.)
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>But if on the other hand art imitates nature, and it is the part 
<A NAME="152"></A>of the same discipline to know the form and the matter up to a point (e.g. 
<A NAME="153"></A>the doctor has a knowledge of health and also of bile and phlegm, in which 
<A NAME="154"></A>health is realized, and the builder both of the form of the house and of 
<A NAME="155"></A>the matter, namely that it is bricks and beams, and so forth): if this 
<A NAME="156"></A>is so, it would be the part of physics also to know nature in both its 
<A NAME="157"></A>senses.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>Again, 'that for the sake of which', or the end, belongs to the 
<A NAME="159"></A>same department of knowledge as the means. But the nature is the end or 
<A NAME="160"></A>'that for the sake of which'. For if a thing undergoes a continuous change 
<A NAME="161"></A>and there is a stage which is last, this stage is the end or 'that for 
<A NAME="162"></A>the sake of which'. (That is why the poet was carried away into making 
<A NAME="163"></A>an absurd statement when he said 'he has the end for the sake of which 
<A NAME="164"></A>he was born'. For not every stage that is last claims to be an end, but 
<A NAME="165"></A>only that which is best.)
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>For the arts make their material (some simply 'make' it, others 
<A NAME="167"></A>make it serviceable), and we use everything as if it was there for our 
<A NAME="168"></A>sake. (We also are in a sense an end. 'That for the sake of which' has 
<A NAME="169"></A>two senses: the distinction is made in our work On Philosophy.) The arts, 
<A NAME="170"></A>therefore, which govern the matter and have knowledge are two, namely the 
<A NAME="171"></A>art which uses the product and the art which directs the production of 
<A NAME="172"></A>it. That is why the using art also is in a sense directive; but it differs 
<A NAME="173"></A>in that it knows the form, whereas the art which is directive as being 
<A NAME="174"></A>concerned with production knows the matter. For the helmsman knows and 
<A NAME="175"></A>prescribes what sort of form a helm should have, the other from what wood 
<A NAME="176"></A>it should be made and by means of what operations. In the products of art, 
<A NAME="177"></A>however, we make the material with a view to the function, whereas in the 
<A NAME="178"></A>products of nature the matter is there all along.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>Again, matter is a relative term: to each form there corresponds 
<A NAME="180"></A>a special matter. How far then must the physicist know the form or essence? 
<A NAME="181"></A>Up to a point, perhaps, as the doctor must know sinew or the smith bronze 
<A NAME="182"></A>(i.e. until he understands the purpose of each): and the physicist is concerned 
<A NAME="183"></A>only with things whose forms are separable indeed, but do not exist apart 
<A NAME="184"></A>from matter. Man is begotten by man and by the sun as well. The mode of 
<A NAME="185"></A>existence and essence of the separable it is the business of the primary 
<A NAME="186"></A>type of philosophy to define.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="187"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>Now that we have established these distinctions, we must proceed 
<A NAME="189"></A>to consider causes, their character and number. Knowledge is the object 
<A NAME="190"></A>of our inquiry, and men do not think they know a thing till they have grasped 
<A NAME="191"></A>the 'why' of (which is to grasp its primary cause). So clearly we too must 
<A NAME="192"></A>do this as regards both coming to be and passing away and every kind of 
<A NAME="193"></A>physical change, in order that, knowing their principles, we may try to 
<A NAME="194"></A>refer to these principles each of our problems.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>In one sense, then, (1) that out of which a thing comes to be and 
<A NAME="196"></A>which persists, is called 'cause', e.g. the bronze of the statue, the silver 
<A NAME="197"></A>of the bowl, and the genera of which the bronze and the silver are 
<A NAME="198"></A>species.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>In another sense (2) the form or the archetype, i.e. the statement 
<A NAME="200"></A>of the essence, and its genera, are called 'causes' (e.g. of the octave 
<A NAME="201"></A>the relation of 2:1, and generally number), and the parts in the 
<A NAME="202"></A>definition.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>Again (3) the primary source of the change or coming to rest; e.g. 
<A NAME="204"></A>the man who gave advice is a cause, the father is cause of the child, and 
<A NAME="205"></A>generally what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is 
<A NAME="206"></A>changed.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>Again (4) in the sense of end or 'that for the sake of which' a 
<A NAME="208"></A>thing is done, e.g. health is the cause of walking about. ('Why is he walking 
<A NAME="209"></A>about?' we say. 'To be healthy', and, having said that, we think we have 
<A NAME="210"></A>assigned the cause.) The same is true also of all the intermediate steps 
<A NAME="211"></A>which are brought about through the action of something else as means towards 
<A NAME="212"></A>the end, e.g. reduction of flesh, purging, drugs, or surgical instruments 
<A NAME="213"></A>are means towards health. All these things are 'for the sake of' the end, 
<A NAME="214"></A>though they differ from one another in that some are activities, others 
<A NAME="215"></A>instruments.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>This then perhaps exhausts the number of ways in which the term 
<A NAME="217"></A>'cause' is used.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>As the word has several senses, it follows that there are several 
<A NAME="219"></A>causes of the same thing not merely in virtue of a concomitant attribute), 
<A NAME="220"></A>e.g. both the art of the sculptor and the bronze are causes of the statue. 
<A NAME="221"></A>These are causes of the statue qua statue, not in virtue of anything else 
<A NAME="222"></A>that it may be-only not in the same way, the one being the material cause, 
<A NAME="223"></A>the other the cause whence the motion comes. Some things cause each other 
<A NAME="224"></A>reciprocally, e.g. hard work causes fitness and vice versa, but again not 
<A NAME="225"></A>in the same way, but the one as end, the other as the origin of change. 
<A NAME="226"></A>Further the same thing is the cause of contrary results. For that which 
<A NAME="227"></A>by its presence brings about one result is sometimes blamed for bringing 
<A NAME="228"></A>about the contrary by its absence. Thus we ascribe the wreck of a ship 
<A NAME="229"></A>to the absence of the pilot whose presence was the cause of its 
<A NAME="230"></A>safety.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR><BR>All the causes now mentioned fall into four familiar divisions. 
<A NAME="232"></A>The letters are the causes of syllables, the material of artificial products, 
<A NAME="233"></A>fire, &c., of bodies, the parts of the whole, and the premisses of the 
<A NAME="234"></A>conclusion, in the sense of 'that from which'. Of these pairs the one set 
<A NAME="235"></A>are causes in the sense of substratum, e.g. the parts, the other set in 
<A NAME="236"></A>the sense of essence-the whole and the combination and the form. But the 
<A NAME="237"></A>seed and the doctor and the adviser, and generally the maker, are all sources 
<A NAME="238"></A>whence the change or stationariness originates, while the others are causes 
<A NAME="239"></A>in the sense of the end or the good of the rest; for 'that for the sake 
<A NAME="240"></A>of which' means what is best and the end of the things that lead up to 
<A NAME="241"></A>it. (Whether we say the 'good itself or the 'apparent good' makes no 
<A NAME="242"></A>difference.)
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>Such then is the number and nature of the kinds of 
<A NAME="244"></A>cause.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR>Now the modes of causation are many, though when brought under heads 
<A NAME="246"></A>they too can be reduced in number. For 'cause' is used in many senses and 
<A NAME="247"></A>even within the same kind one may be prior to another (e.g. the doctor 
<A NAME="248"></A>and the expert are causes of health, the relation 2:1 and number of the 
<A NAME="249"></A>octave), and always what is inclusive to what is particular. Another mode 
<A NAME="250"></A>of causation is the incidental and its genera, e.g. in one way 'Polyclitus', 
<A NAME="251"></A>in another 'sculptor' is the cause of a statue, because 'being Polyclitus' 
<A NAME="252"></A>and 'sculptor' are incidentally conjoined. Also the classes in which the 
<A NAME="253"></A>incidental attribute is included; thus 'a man' could be said to be the 
<A NAME="254"></A>cause of a statue or, generally, 'a living creature'. An incidental attribute 
<A NAME="255"></A>too may be more or less remote, e.g. suppose that 'a pale man' or 'a musical 
<A NAME="256"></A>man' were said to be the cause of the statue.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>All causes, both proper and incidental, may be spoken of either 
<A NAME="258"></A>as potential or as actual; e.g. the cause of a house being built is either 
<A NAME="259"></A>'house-builder' or 'house-builder building'.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>Similar distinctions can be made in the things of which the causes 
<A NAME="261"></A>are causes, e.g. of 'this statue' or of 'statue' or of 'image' generally, 
<A NAME="262"></A>of 'this bronze' or of 'bronze' or of 'material' generally. So too with 
<A NAME="263"></A>the incidental attributes. Again we may use a complex expression for either 
<A NAME="264"></A>and say, e.g. neither 'Polyclitus' nor 'sculptor' but 'Polyclitus, 
<A NAME="265"></A>sculptor'.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>All these various uses, however, come to six in number, under each 
<A NAME="267"></A>of which again the usage is twofold. Cause means either what is particular 
<A NAME="268"></A>or a genus, or an incidental attribute or a genus of that, and these either 
<A NAME="269"></A>as a complex or each by itself; and all six either as actual or as potential. 
<A NAME="270"></A>The difference is this much, that causes which are actually at work and 
<A NAME="271"></A>particular exist and cease to exist simultaneously with their effect, e.g. 
<A NAME="272"></A>this healing person with this being-healed person and that house-building 
<A NAME="273"></A>man with that being-built house; but this is not always true of potential 
<A NAME="274"></A>causes--the house and the housebuilder do not pass away 
<A NAME="275"></A>simultaneously.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>In investigating the cause of each thing it is always necessary 
<A NAME="277"></A>to seek what is most precise (as also in other things): thus man builds 
<A NAME="278"></A>because he is a builder, and a builder builds in virtue of his art of building. 
<A NAME="279"></A>This last cause then is prior: and so generally.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>Further, generic effects should be assigned to generic causes, 
<A NAME="281"></A>particular effects to particular causes, e.g. statue to sculptor, this 
<A NAME="282"></A>statue to this sculptor; and powers are relative to possible effects, actually 
<A NAME="283"></A>operating causes to things which are actually being 
<A NAME="284"></A>effected.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>This must suffice for our account of the number of causes and the 
<A NAME="286"></A>modes of causation.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="287"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>But chance also and spontaneity are reckoned among causes: many 
<A NAME="289"></A>things are said both to be and to come to be as a result of chance and 
<A NAME="290"></A>spontaneity. We must inquire therefore in what manner chance and spontaneity 
<A NAME="291"></A>are present among the causes enumerated, and whether they are the same 
<A NAME="292"></A>or different, and generally what chance and spontaneity 
<A NAME="293"></A>are.
<A NAME="294"></A><BR><BR>Some people even question whether they are real or not. They say 
<A NAME="295"></A>that nothing happens by chance, but that everything which we ascribe to 
<A NAME="296"></A>chance or spontaneity has some definite cause, e.g. coming 'by chance' 
<A NAME="297"></A>into the market and finding there a man whom one wanted but did not expect 
<A NAME="298"></A>to meet is due to one's wish to go and buy in the market. Similarly in 
<A NAME="299"></A>other cases of chance it is always possible, they maintain, to find something 
<A NAME="300"></A>which is the cause; but not chance, for if chance were real, it would seem 
<A NAME="301"></A>strange indeed, and the question might be raised, why on earth none of 
<A NAME="302"></A>the wise men of old in speaking of the causes of generation and decay took 
<A NAME="303"></A>account of chance; whence it would seem that they too did not believe that 
<A NAME="304"></A>anything is by chance. But there is a further circumstance that is surprising. 
<A NAME="305"></A>Many things both come to be and are by chance and spontaneity, and although 
<A NAME="306"></A>know that each of them can be ascribed to some cause (as the old argument 
<A NAME="307"></A>said which denied chance), nevertheless they speak of some of these things 
<A NAME="308"></A>as happening by chance and others not. For this reason also they ought 
<A NAME="309"></A>to have at least referred to the matter in some way or 
<A NAME="310"></A>other.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>Certainly the early physicists found no place for chance among 
<A NAME="312"></A>the causes which they recognized-love, strife, mind, fire, or the like. 
<A NAME="313"></A>This is strange, whether they supposed that there is no such thing as chance 
<A NAME="314"></A>or whether they thought there is but omitted to mention it-and that too 
<A NAME="315"></A>when they sometimes used it, as Empedocles does when he says that the air 
<A NAME="316"></A>is not always separated into the highest region, but 'as it may chance'. 
<A NAME="317"></A>At any rate he says in his cosmogony that 'it happened to run that way 
<A NAME="318"></A>at that time, but it often ran otherwise.' He tells us also that most of 
<A NAME="319"></A>the parts of animals came to be by chance.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>There are some too who ascribe this heavenly sphere and all the 
<A NAME="321"></A>worlds to spontaneity. They say that the vortex arose spontaneously, i.e. 
<A NAME="322"></A>the motion that separated and arranged in its present order all that exists. 
<A NAME="323"></A>This statement might well cause surprise. For they are asserting that chance 
<A NAME="324"></A>is not responsible for the existence or generation of animals and plants, 
<A NAME="325"></A>nature or mind or something of the kind being the cause of them (for it 
<A NAME="326"></A>is not any chance thing that comes from a given seed but an olive from 
<A NAME="327"></A>one kind and a man from another); and yet at the same time they assert 
<A NAME="328"></A>that the heavenly sphere and the divinest of visible things arose spontaneously, 
<A NAME="329"></A>having no such cause as is assigned to animals and plants. Yet if this 
<A NAME="330"></A>is so, it is a fact which deserves to be dwelt upon, and something might 
<A NAME="331"></A>well have been said about it. For besides the other absurdities of the 
<A NAME="332"></A>statement, it is the more absurd that people should make it when they see 
<A NAME="333"></A>nothing coming to be spontaneously in the heavens, but much happening by 
<A NAME="334"></A>chance among the things which as they say are not due to chance; whereas 
<A NAME="335"></A>we should have expected exactly the opposite.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>Others there are who, indeed, believe that chance is a cause, but 
<A NAME="337"></A>that it is inscrutable to human intelligence, as being a divine thing and 
<A NAME="338"></A>full of mystery.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>Thus we must inquire what chance and spontaneity are, whether they 
<A NAME="340"></A>are the same or different, and how they fit into our division of 
<A NAME="341"></A>causes.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="342"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>First then we observe that some things always come to pass in the 
<A NAME="344"></A>same way, and others for the most part. It is clearly of neither of these 
<A NAME="345"></A>that chance is said to be the cause, nor can the 'effect of chance' be 
<A NAME="346"></A>identified with any of the things that come to pass by necessity and always, 
<A NAME="347"></A>or for the most part. But as there is a third class of events besides these 
<A NAME="348"></A>two-events which all say are 'by chance'-it is plain that there is such 
<A NAME="349"></A>a thing as chance and spontaneity; for we know that things of this kind 
<A NAME="350"></A>are due to chance and that things due to chance are of this 
<A NAME="351"></A>kind.
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>But, secondly, some events are for the sake of something, others 
<A NAME="353"></A>not. Again, some of the former class are in accordance with deliberate 
<A NAME="354"></A>intention, others not, but both are in the class of things which are for 
<A NAME="355"></A>the sake of something. Hence it is clear that even among the things which 
<A NAME="356"></A>are outside the necessary and the normal, there are some in connexion withwhich 
<A NAME="357"></A>the phrase 'for the sake of something' is applicable. (Events that are 
<A NAME="358"></A>for the sake of something include whatever may be done as a result of thought 
<A NAME="359"></A>or of nature.) Things of this kind, then, when they come to pass incidental 
<A NAME="360"></A>are said to be 'by chance'. For just as a thing is something either in 
<A NAME="361"></A>virtue of itself or incidentally, so may it be a cause. For instance, the 
<A NAME="362"></A>housebuilding faculty is in virtue of itself the cause of a house, whereas 
<A NAME="363"></A>the pale or the musical is the incidental cause. That which is per se cause 
<A NAME="364"></A>of the effect is determinate, but the incidental cause is indeterminable, 
<A NAME="365"></A>for the possible attributes of an individual are innumerable. To resume 
<A NAME="366"></A>then; when a thing of this kind comes to pass among events which are for 
<A NAME="367"></A>the sake of something, it is said to be spontaneous or by chance. (The 
<A NAME="368"></A>distinction between the two must be made later-for the present it is sufficient 
<A NAME="369"></A>if it is plain that both are in the sphere of things done for the sake 
<A NAME="370"></A>of something.)
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>Example: A man is engaged in collecting subscriptions for a feast. 
<A NAME="372"></A>He would have gone to such and such a place for the purpose of getting 
<A NAME="373"></A>the money, if he had known. He actually went there for another purpose 
<A NAME="374"></A>and it was only incidentally that he got his money by going there; and 
<A NAME="375"></A>this was not due to the fact that he went there as a rule or necessarily, 
<A NAME="376"></A>nor is the end effected (getting the money) a cause present in himself-it 
<A NAME="377"></A>belongs to the class of things that are intentional and the result of intelligent 
<A NAME="378"></A>deliberation. It is when these conditions are satisfied that the man is 
<A NAME="379"></A>said to have gone 'by chance'. If he had gone of deliberate purpose and 
<A NAME="380"></A>for the sake of this-if he always or normally went there when he was collecting 
<A NAME="381"></A>payments-he would not be said to have gone 'by chance'.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then that chance is an incidental cause in the sphere 
<A NAME="383"></A>of those actions for the sake of something which involve purpose. Intelligent 
<A NAME="384"></A>reflection, then, and chance are in the same sphere, for purpose implies 
<A NAME="385"></A>intelligent reflection.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>It is necessary, no doubt, that the causes of what comes to pass 
<A NAME="387"></A>by chance be indefinite; and that is why chance is supposed to belong to 
<A NAME="388"></A>the class of the indefinite and to be inscrutable to man, and why it might 
<A NAME="389"></A>be thought that, in a way, nothing occurs by chance. For all these statements 
<A NAME="390"></A>are correct, because they are well grounded. Things do, in a way, occur 
<A NAME="391"></A>by chance, for they occur incidentally and chance is an incidental cause. 
<A NAME="392"></A>But strictly it is not the cause-without qualification-of anything; for 
<A NAME="393"></A>instance, a housebuilder is the cause of a house; incidentally, a fluteplayer 
<A NAME="394"></A>may be so.
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>And the causes of the man's coming and getting the money (when 
<A NAME="396"></A>he did not come for the sake of that) are innumerable. He may have wished 
<A NAME="397"></A>to see somebody or been following somebody or avoiding somebody, or may 
<A NAME="398"></A>have gone to see a spectacle. Thus to say that chance is a thing contrary 
<A NAME="399"></A>to rule is correct. For 'rule' applies to what is always true or true for 
<A NAME="400"></A>the most part, whereas chance belongs to a third type of event. Hence, 
<A NAME="401"></A>to conclude, since causes of this kind are indefinite, chance too is indefinite. 
<A NAME="402"></A>(Yet in some cases one might raise the question whether any incidental 
<A NAME="403"></A>fact might be the cause of the chance occurrence, e.g. of health the fresh 
<A NAME="404"></A>air or the sun's heat may be the cause, but having had one's hair cut cannot; 
<A NAME="405"></A>for some incidental causes are more relevant to the effect than 
<A NAME="406"></A>others.)
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>Chance or fortune is called 'good' when the result is good, 'evil' 
<A NAME="408"></A>when it is evil. The terms 'good fortune' and 'ill fortune' are used when 
<A NAME="409"></A>either result is of considerable magnitude. Thus one who comes within an 
<A NAME="410"></A>ace of some great evil or great good is said to be fortunate or unfortunate. 
<A NAME="411"></A>The mind affirms the essence of the attribute, ignoring the hair's breadth 
<A NAME="412"></A>of difference. Further, it is with reason that good fortune is regarded 
<A NAME="413"></A>as unstable; for chance is unstable, as none of the things which result 
<A NAME="414"></A>from it can be invariable or normal.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>Both are then, as I have said, incidental causes-both chance and 
<A NAME="416"></A>spontaneity-in the sphere of things which are capable of coming to pass 
<A NAME="417"></A>not necessarily, nor normally, and with reference to such of these as might 
<A NAME="418"></A>come to pass for the sake of something.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="419"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>They differ in that 'spontaneity' is the wider term. Every result 
<A NAME="421"></A>of chance is from what is spontaneous, but not everything that is from 
<A NAME="422"></A>what is spontaneous is from chance.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>Chance and what results from chance are appropriate to agents that 
<A NAME="424"></A>are capable of good fortune and of moral action generally. Therefore necessarily 
<A NAME="425"></A>chance is in the sphere of moral actions. This is indicated by the fact 
<A NAME="426"></A>that good fortune is thought to be the same, or nearly the same, as happiness, 
<A NAME="427"></A>and happiness to be a kind of moral action, since it is well-doing. Hence 
<A NAME="428"></A>what is not capable of moral action cannot do anything by chance. Thus 
<A NAME="429"></A>an inanimate thing or a lower animal or a child cannot do anything by chance, 
<A NAME="430"></A>because it is incapable of deliberate intention; nor can 'good fortune' 
<A NAME="431"></A>or 'ill fortune' be ascribed to them, except metaphorically, as Protarchus, 
<A NAME="432"></A>for example, said that the stones of which altars are made are fortunate 
<A NAME="433"></A>because they are held in honour, while their fellows are trodden under 
<A NAME="434"></A>foot. Even these things, however, can in a way be affected by chance, when 
<A NAME="435"></A>one who is dealing with them does something to them by chance, but not 
<A NAME="436"></A>otherwise.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>The spontaneous on the other hand is found both in the lower animals 
<A NAME="438"></A>and in many inanimate objects. We say, for example, that the horse came 
<A NAME="439"></A>'spontaneously', because, though his coming saved him, he did not come 
<A NAME="440"></A>for the sake of safety. Again, the tripod fell 'of itself', because, though 
<A NAME="441"></A>when it fell it stood on its feet so as to serve for a seat, it did not 
<A NAME="442"></A>fall for the sake of that.
<A NAME="443"></A><BR><BR>Hence it is clear that events which (1) belong to the general class 
<A NAME="444"></A>of things that may come to pass for the sake of something, (2) do not come 
<A NAME="445"></A>to pass for the sake of what actually results, and (3) have an external 
<A NAME="446"></A>cause, may be described by the phrase 'from spontaneity'. These 'spontaneous' 
<A NAME="447"></A>events are said to be 'from chance' if they have the further characteristics 
<A NAME="448"></A>of being the objects of deliberate intention and due to agents capable 
<A NAME="449"></A>of that mode of action. This is indicated by the phrase 'in vain', which 
<A NAME="450"></A>is used when A which is for the sake of B, does not result in B. For instance, 
<A NAME="451"></A>taking a walk is for the sake of evacuation of the bowels; if this does 
<A NAME="452"></A>not follow after walking, we say that we have walked 'in vain' and that 
<A NAME="453"></A>the walking was 'vain'. This implies that what is naturally the means to 
<A NAME="454"></A>an end is 'in vain', when it does not effect the end towards which it was 
<A NAME="455"></A>the natural means-for it would be absurd for a man to say that he had bathed 
<A NAME="456"></A>in vain because the sun was not eclipsed, since the one was not done with 
<A NAME="457"></A>a view to the other. Thus the spontaneous is even according to its derivation 
<A NAME="458"></A>the case in which the thing itself happens in vain. The stone that struck 
<A NAME="459"></A>the man did not fall for the purpose of striking him; therefore it fell 
<A NAME="460"></A>spontaneously, because it might have fallen by the action of an agent and 
<A NAME="461"></A>for the purpose of striking. The difference between spontaneity and what 
<A NAME="462"></A>results by chance is greatest in things that come to be by nature; for 
<A NAME="463"></A>when anything comes to be contrary to nature, we do not say that it came 
<A NAME="464"></A>to be by chance, but by spontaneity. Yet strictly this too is different 
<A NAME="465"></A>from the spontaneous proper; for the cause of the latter is external, that 
<A NAME="466"></A>of the former internal.
<A NAME="467"></A><BR><BR>We have now explained what chance is and what spontaneity is, and 
<A NAME="468"></A>in what they differ from each other. Both belong to the mode of causation 
<A NAME="469"></A>'source of change', for either some natural or some intelligent agent is 
<A NAME="470"></A>always the cause; but in this sort of causation the number of possible 
<A NAME="471"></A>causes is infinite.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>Spontaneity and chance are causes of effects which though they 
<A NAME="473"></A>might result from intelligence or nature, have in fact been caused by something 
<A NAME="474"></A>incidentally. Now since nothing which is incidental is prior to what is 
<A NAME="475"></A>per se, it is clear that no incidental cause can be prior to a cause per 
<A NAME="476"></A>se. Spontaneity and chance, therefore, are posterior to intelligence and 
<A NAME="477"></A>nature. Hence, however true it may be that the heavens are due to spontaneity, 
<A NAME="478"></A>it will still be true that intelligence and nature will be prior causes 
<A NAME="479"></A>of this All and of many things in it besides.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="480"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then that there are causes, and that the number of 
<A NAME="482"></A>them is what we have stated. The number is the same as that of the things 
<A NAME="483"></A>comprehended under the question 'why'. The 'why' is referred ultimately 
<A NAME="484"></A>either (1), in things which do not involve motion, e.g. in mathematics, 
<A NAME="485"></A>to the 'what' (to the definition of 'straight line' or 'commensurable', 
<A NAME="486"></A>&c.), or (2) to what initiated a motion, e.g. 'why did they go to war?-because 
<A NAME="487"></A>there had been a raid'; or (3) we are inquiring 'for the sake of what?'-'that 
<A NAME="488"></A>they may rule'; or (4), in the case of things that come into being, we 
<A NAME="489"></A>are looking for the matter. The causes, therefore, are these and so many 
<A NAME="490"></A>in number.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>Now, the causes being four, it is the business of the physicist 
<A NAME="492"></A>to know about them all, and if he refers his problems back to all of them, 
<A NAME="493"></A>he will assign the 'why' in the way proper to his science-the matter, the 
<A NAME="494"></A>form, the mover, 'that for the sake of which'. The last three often coincide; 
<A NAME="495"></A>for the 'what' and 'that for the sake of which' are one, while the primary 
<A NAME="496"></A>source of motion is the same in species as these (for man generates man), 
<A NAME="497"></A>and so too, in general, are all things which cause movement by being themselves 
<A NAME="498"></A>moved; and such as are not of this kind are no longer inside the province 
<A NAME="499"></A>of physics, for they cause motion not by possessing motion or a source 
<A NAME="500"></A>of motion in themselves, but being themselves incapable of motion. Hence 
<A NAME="501"></A>there are three branches of study, one of things which are incapable of 
<A NAME="502"></A>motion, the second of things in motion, but indestructible, the third of 
<A NAME="503"></A>destructible things.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>The question 'why', then, is answered by reference to the matter, 
<A NAME="505"></A>to the form, and to the primary moving cause. For in respect of coming 
<A NAME="506"></A>to be it is mostly in this last way that causes are investigated-'what 
<A NAME="507"></A>comes to be after what? what was the primary agent or patient?' and so 
<A NAME="508"></A>at each step of the series.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>Now the principles which cause motion in a physical way are two, 
<A NAME="510"></A>of which one is not physical, as it has no principle of motion in itself. 
<A NAME="511"></A>Of this kind is whatever causes movement, not being itself moved, such 
<A NAME="512"></A>as (1) that which is completely unchangeable, the primary reality, and 
<A NAME="513"></A>(2) the essence of that which is coming to be, i.e. the form; for this 
<A NAME="514"></A>is the end or 'that for the sake of which'. Hence since nature is for the 
<A NAME="515"></A>sake of something, we must know this cause also. We must explain the 'why' 
<A NAME="516"></A>in all the senses of the term, namely, (1) that from this that will necessarily 
<A NAME="517"></A>result ('from this' either without qualification or in most cases); (2) 
<A NAME="518"></A>that 'this must be so if that is to be so' (as the conclusion presupposes 
<A NAME="519"></A>the premisses); (3) that this was the essence of the thing; and (4) because 
<A NAME="520"></A>it is better thus (not without qualification, but with reference to the 
<A NAME="521"></A>essential nature in each case).
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="522"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="523"></A><BR><BR>We must explain then (1) that Nature belongs to the class of causes 
<A NAME="524"></A>which act for the sake of something; (2) about the necessary and its place 
<A NAME="525"></A>in physical problems, for all writers ascribe things to this cause, arguing 
<A NAME="526"></A>that since the hot and the cold, &c., are of such and such a kind, therefore 
<A NAME="527"></A>certain things necessarily are and come to be-and if they mention any other 
<A NAME="528"></A>cause (one his 'friendship and strife', another his 'mind'), it is only 
<A NAME="529"></A>to touch on it, and then good-bye to it.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>A difficulty presents itself: why should not nature work, not for 
<A NAME="531"></A>the sake of something, nor because it is better so, but just as the sky 
<A NAME="532"></A>rains, not in order to make the corn grow, but of necessity? What is drawn 
<A NAME="533"></A>up must cool, and what has been cooled must become water and descend, the 
<A NAME="534"></A>result of this being that the corn grows. Similarly if a man's crop is 
<A NAME="535"></A>spoiled on the threshing-floor, the rain did not fall for the sake of this-in 
<A NAME="536"></A>order that the crop might be spoiled-but that result just followed. Why 
<A NAME="537"></A>then should it not be the same with the parts in nature, e.g. that our 
<A NAME="538"></A>teeth should come up of necessity-the front teeth sharp, fitted for tearing, 
<A NAME="539"></A>the molars broad and useful for grinding down the food-since they did not 
<A NAME="540"></A>arise for this end, but it was merely a coincident result; and so with 
<A NAME="541"></A>all other parts in which we suppose that there is purpose? Wherever then 
<A NAME="542"></A>all the parts came about just what they would have been if they had come 
<A NAME="543"></A>be for an end, such things survived, being organized spontaneously in a 
<A NAME="544"></A>fitting way; whereas those which grew otherwise perished and continue to 
<A NAME="545"></A>perish, as Empedocles says his 'man-faced ox-progeny' 
<A NAME="546"></A>did.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>Such are the arguments (and others of the kind) which may cause 
<A NAME="548"></A>difficulty on this point. Yet it is impossible that this should be the 
<A NAME="549"></A>true view. For teeth and all other natural things either invariably or 
<A NAME="550"></A>normally come about in a given way; but of not one of the results of chance 
<A NAME="551"></A>or spontaneity is this true. We do not ascribe to chance or mere coincidence 
<A NAME="552"></A>the frequency of rain in winter, but frequent rain in summer we do; nor 
<A NAME="553"></A>heat in the dog-days, but only if we have it in winter. If then, it is 
<A NAME="554"></A>agreed that things are either the result of coincidence or for an end, 
<A NAME="555"></A>and these cannot be the result of coincidence or spontaneity, it follows 
<A NAME="556"></A>that they must be for an end; and that such things are all due to nature 
<A NAME="557"></A>even the champions of the theory which is before us would agree. Therefore 
<A NAME="558"></A>action for an end is present in things which come to be and are by 
<A NAME="559"></A>nature.
<A NAME="560"></A><BR><BR>Further, where a series has a completion, all the preceding steps 
<A NAME="561"></A>are for the sake of that. Now surely as in intelligent action, so in nature; 
<A NAME="562"></A>and as in nature, so it is in each action, if nothing interferes. Now intelligent 
<A NAME="563"></A>action is for the sake of an end; therefore the nature of things also is 
<A NAME="564"></A>so. Thus if a house, e.g. had been a thing made by nature, it would have 
<A NAME="565"></A>been made in the same way as it is now by art; and if things made by nature 
<A NAME="566"></A>were made also by art, they would come to be in the same way as by nature. 
<A NAME="567"></A>Each step then in the series is for the sake of the next; and generally 
<A NAME="568"></A>art partly completes what nature cannot bring to a finish, and partly imitates 
<A NAME="569"></A>her. If, therefore, artificial products are for the sake of an end, so 
<A NAME="570"></A>clearly also are natural products. The relation of the later to the earlier 
<A NAME="571"></A>terms of the series is the same in both. This is most obvious in the animals 
<A NAME="572"></A>other than man: they make things neither by art nor after inquiry or deliberation. 
<A NAME="573"></A>Wherefore people discuss whether it is by intelligence or by some other 
<A NAME="574"></A>faculty that these creatures work,spiders, ants, and the like. By gradual 
<A NAME="575"></A>advance in this direction we come to see clearly that in plants too that 
<A NAME="576"></A>is produced which is conducive to the end-leaves, e.g. grow to provide 
<A NAME="577"></A>shade for the fruit. If then it is both by nature and for an end that the 
<A NAME="578"></A>swallow makes its nest and the spider its web, and plants grow leaves for 
<A NAME="579"></A>the sake of the fruit and send their roots down (not up) for the sake of 
<A NAME="580"></A>nourishment, it is plain that this kind of cause is operative in things 
<A NAME="581"></A>which come to be and are by nature. And since 'nature' means two things, 
<A NAME="582"></A>the matter and the form, of which the latter is the end, and since all 
<A NAME="583"></A>the rest is for the sake of the end, the form must be the cause in the 
<A NAME="584"></A>sense of 'that for the sake of which'.
<A NAME="585"></A><BR><BR>Now mistakes come to pass even in the operations of art: the grammarian 
<A NAME="586"></A>makes a mistake in writing and the doctor pours out the wrong dose. Hence 
<A NAME="587"></A>clearly mistakes are possible in the operations of nature also. If then 
<A NAME="588"></A>in art there are cases in which what is rightly produced serves a purpose, 
<A NAME="589"></A>and if where mistakes occur there was a purpose in what was attempted, 
<A NAME="590"></A>only it was not attained, so must it be also in natural products, and monstrosities 
<A NAME="591"></A>will be failures in the purposive effort. Thus in the original combinations 
<A NAME="592"></A>the 'ox-progeny' if they failed to reach a determinate end must have arisen 
<A NAME="593"></A>through the corruption of some principle corresponding to what is now the 
<A NAME="594"></A>seed.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>Further, seed must have come into being first, and not straightway 
<A NAME="596"></A>the animals: the words 'whole-natured first...' must have meant 
<A NAME="597"></A>seed.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>Again, in plants too we find the relation of means to end, though 
<A NAME="599"></A>the degree of organization is less. Were there then in plants also 'olive-headed 
<A NAME="600"></A>vine-progeny', like the 'man-headed ox-progeny', or not? An absurd suggestion; 
<A NAME="601"></A>yet there must have been, if there were such things among 
<A NAME="602"></A>animals.
<A NAME="603"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, among the seeds anything must have come to be at random. 
<A NAME="604"></A>But the person who asserts this entirely does away with 'nature' and what 
<A NAME="605"></A>exists 'by nature'. For those things are natural which, by a continuous 
<A NAME="606"></A>movement originated from an internal principle, arrive at some completion: 
<A NAME="607"></A>the same completion is not reached from every principle; nor any chance 
<A NAME="608"></A>completion, but always the tendency in each is towards the same end, if 
<A NAME="609"></A>there is no impediment.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>The end and the means towards it may come about by chance. We say, 
<A NAME="611"></A>for instance, that a stranger has come by chance, paid the ransom, and 
<A NAME="612"></A>gone away, when he does so as if he had come for that purpose, though it 
<A NAME="613"></A>was not for that that he came. This is incidental, for chance is an incidental 
<A NAME="614"></A>cause, as I remarked before. But when an event takes place always or for 
<A NAME="615"></A>the most part, it is not incidental or by chance. In natural products the 
<A NAME="616"></A>sequence is invariable, if there is no impediment.
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR>It is absurd to suppose that purpose is not present because we 
<A NAME="618"></A>do not observe the agent deliberating. Art does not deliberate. If the 
<A NAME="619"></A>ship-building art were in the wood, it would produce the same results by 
<A NAME="620"></A>nature. If, therefore, purpose is present in art, it is present also in 
<A NAME="621"></A>nature. The best illustration is a doctor doctoring himself: nature is 
<A NAME="622"></A>like that.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>It is plain then that nature is a cause, a cause that operates 
<A NAME="624"></A>for a purpose.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="625"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>As regards what is 'of necessity', we must ask whether the necessity 
<A NAME="627"></A>is 'hypothetical', or 'simple' as well. The current view places what is 
<A NAME="628"></A>of necessity in the process of production, just as if one were to suppose 
<A NAME="629"></A>that the wall of a house necessarily comes to be because what is heavy 
<A NAME="630"></A>is naturally carried downwards and what is light to the top, wherefore 
<A NAME="631"></A>the stones and foundations take the lowest place, with earth above because 
<A NAME="632"></A>it is lighter, and wood at the top of all as being the lightest. Whereas, 
<A NAME="633"></A>though the wall does not come to be without these, it is not due to these, 
<A NAME="634"></A>except as its material cause: it comes to be for the sake of sheltering 
<A NAME="635"></A>and guarding certain things. Similarly in all other things which involve 
<A NAME="636"></A>production for an end; the product cannot come to be without things which 
<A NAME="637"></A>have a necessary nature, but it is not due to these (except as its material); 
<A NAME="638"></A>it comes to be for an end. For instance, why is a saw such as it is? To 
<A NAME="639"></A>effect so-and-so and for the sake of so-and-so. This end, however, cannot 
<A NAME="640"></A>be realized unless the saw is made of iron. It is, therefore, necessary 
<A NAME="641"></A>for it to be of iron, it we are to have a saw and perform the operation 
<A NAME="642"></A>of sawing. What is necessary then, is necessary on a hypothesis; it is 
<A NAME="643"></A>not a result necessarily determined by antecedents. Necessity is in the 
<A NAME="644"></A>matter, while 'that for the sake of which' is in the 
<A NAME="645"></A>definition.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>Necessity in mathematics is in a way similar to necessity in things 
<A NAME="647"></A>which come to be through the operation of nature. Since a straight line 
<A NAME="648"></A>is what it is, it is necessary that the angles of a triangle should equal 
<A NAME="649"></A>two right angles. But not conversely; though if the angles are not equal 
<A NAME="650"></A>to two right angles, then the straight line is not what it is either. But 
<A NAME="651"></A>in things which come to be for an end, the reverse is true. If the end 
<A NAME="652"></A>is to exist or does exist, that also which precedes it will exist or does 
<A NAME="653"></A>exist; otherwise just as there, if-the conclusion is not true, the premiss 
<A NAME="654"></A>will not be true, so here the end or 'that for the sake of which' will 
<A NAME="655"></A>not exist. For this too is itself a starting-point, but of the reasoning, 
<A NAME="656"></A>not of the action; while in mathematics the starting-point is the starting-point 
<A NAME="657"></A>of the reasoning only, as there is no action. If then there is to be a 
<A NAME="658"></A>house, such-and-such things must be made or be there already or exist, 
<A NAME="659"></A>or generally the matter relative to the end, bricks and stones if it is 
<A NAME="660"></A>a house. But the end is not due to these except as the matter, nor will 
<A NAME="661"></A>it come to exist because of them. Yet if they do not exist at all, neither 
<A NAME="662"></A>will the house, or the saw-the former in the absence of stones, the latter 
<A NAME="663"></A>in the absence of iron-just as in the other case the premisses will not 
<A NAME="664"></A>be true, if the angles of the triangle are not equal to two right 
<A NAME="665"></A>angles.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR>The necessary in nature, then, is plainly what we call by the name 
<A NAME="667"></A>of matter, and the changes in it. Both causes must be stated by the physicist, 
<A NAME="668"></A>but especially the end; for that is the cause of the matter, not vice versa; 
<A NAME="669"></A>and the end is 'that for the sake of which', and the beginning starts from 
<A NAME="670"></A>the definition or essence; as in artificial products, since a house is 
<A NAME="671"></A>of such-and-such a kind, certain things must necessarily come to be or 
<A NAME="672"></A>be there already, or since health is this, these things must necessarily 
<A NAME="673"></A>come to be or be there already. Similarly if man is this, then these; if 
<A NAME="674"></A>these, then those. Perhaps the necessary is present also in the definition. 
<A NAME="675"></A>For if one defines the operation of sawing as being a certain kind of dividing, 
<A NAME="676"></A>then this cannot come about unless the saw has teeth of a certain kind; 
<A NAME="677"></A>and these cannot be unless it is of iron. For in the definition too there 
<A NAME="678"></A>are some parts that are, as it were, its matter.
