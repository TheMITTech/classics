<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>1
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual 
<A NAME="12"></A>virtue in the main owes both its birth and its growth to teaching (for 
<A NAME="13"></A>which reason it requires experience and time), while moral virtue comes 
<A NAME="14"></A>about as a result of habit, whence also its name (ethike) is one that is 
<A NAME="15"></A>formed by a slight variation from the word ethos (habit). From this it 
<A NAME="16"></A>is also plain that none of the moral virtues arises in us by nature; for 
<A NAME="17"></A>nothing that exists by nature can form a habit contrary to its nature. 
<A NAME="18"></A>For instance the stone which by nature moves downwards cannot be habituated 
<A NAME="19"></A>to move upwards, not even if one tries to train it by throwing it up ten 
<A NAME="20"></A>thousand times; nor can fire be habituated to move downwards, nor can anything 
<A NAME="21"></A>else that by nature behaves in one way be trained to behave in another. 
<A NAME="22"></A>Neither by nature, then, nor contrary to nature do the virtues arise in 
<A NAME="23"></A>us; rather we are adapted by nature to receive them, and are made perfect 
<A NAME="24"></A>by habit.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>Again, of all the things that come to us by nature we first acquire 
<A NAME="26"></A>the potentiality and later exhibit the activity (this is plain in the case 
<A NAME="27"></A>of the senses; for it was not by often seeing or often hearing that we 
<A NAME="28"></A>got these senses, but on the contrary we had them before we used them, 
<A NAME="29"></A>and did not come to have them by using them); but the virtues we get by 
<A NAME="30"></A>first exercising them, as also happens in the case of the arts as well. 
<A NAME="31"></A>For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing 
<A NAME="32"></A>them, e.g. men become builders by building and lyreplayers by playing the 
<A NAME="33"></A>lyre; so too we become just by doing just acts, temperate by doing temperate 
<A NAME="34"></A>acts, brave by doing brave acts.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>This is confirmed by what happens in states; for legislators make 
<A NAME="36"></A>the citizens good by forming habits in them, and this is the wish of every 
<A NAME="37"></A>legislator, and those who do not effect it miss their mark, and it is in 
<A NAME="38"></A>this that a good constitution differs from a bad one.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>Again, it is from the same causes and by the same means that every 
<A NAME="40"></A>virtue is both produced and destroyed, and similarly every art; for it 
<A NAME="41"></A>is from playing the lyre that both good and bad lyre-players are produced. 
<A NAME="42"></A>And the corresponding statement is true of builders and of all the rest; 
<A NAME="43"></A>men will be good or bad builders as a result of building well or badly. 
<A NAME="44"></A>For if this were not so, there would have been no need of a teacher, but 
<A NAME="45"></A>all men would have been born good or bad at their craft. This, then, is 
<A NAME="46"></A>the case with the virtues also; by doing the acts that we do in our transactions 
<A NAME="47"></A>with other men we become just or unjust, and by doing the acts that we 
<A NAME="48"></A>do in the presence of danger, and being habituated to feel fear or confidence, 
<A NAME="49"></A>we become brave or cowardly. The same is true of appetites and feelings 
<A NAME="50"></A>of anger; some men become temperate and good-tempered, others self-indulgent 
<A NAME="51"></A>and irascible, by behaving in one way or the other in the appropriate circumstances. 
<A NAME="52"></A>Thus, in one word, states of character arise out of like activities. This 
<A NAME="53"></A>is why the activities we exhibit must be of a certain kind; it is because 
<A NAME="54"></A>the states of character correspond to the differences between these. It 
<A NAME="55"></A>makes no small difference, then, whether we form habits of one kind or 
<A NAME="56"></A>of another from our very youth; it makes a very great difference, or rather 
<A NAME="57"></A>all the difference.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>2
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>Since, then, the present inquiry does not aim at theoretical knowledge 
<A NAME="60"></A>like the others (for we are inquiring not in order to know what virtue 
<A NAME="61"></A>is, but in order to become good, since otherwise our inquiry would have 
<A NAME="62"></A>been of no use), we must examine the nature of actions, namely how we ought 
<A NAME="63"></A>to do them; for these determine also the nature of the states of character 
<A NAME="64"></A>that are produced, as we have said. Now, that we must act according to 
<A NAME="65"></A>the right rule is a common principle and must be assumed-it will be discussed 
<A NAME="66"></A>later, i.e. both what the right rule is, and how it is related to the other 
<A NAME="67"></A>virtues. But this must be agreed upon beforehand, that the whole account 
<A NAME="68"></A>of matters of conduct must be given in outline and not precisely, as we 
<A NAME="69"></A>said at the very beginning that the accounts we demand must be in accordance 
<A NAME="70"></A>with the subject-matter; matters concerned with conduct and questions of 
<A NAME="71"></A>what is good for us have no fixity, any more than matters of health. The 
<A NAME="72"></A>general account being of this nature, the account of particular cases is 
<A NAME="73"></A>yet more lacking in exactness; for they do not fall under any art or precept 
<A NAME="74"></A>but the agents themselves must in each case consider what is appropriate 
<A NAME="75"></A>to the occasion, as happens also in the art of medicine or of 
<A NAME="76"></A>navigation.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>But though our present account is of this nature we must give what 
<A NAME="78"></A>help we can. First, then, let us consider this, that it is the nature of 
<A NAME="79"></A>such things to be destroyed by defect and excess, as we see in the case 
<A NAME="80"></A>of strength and of health (for to gain light on things imperceptible we 
<A NAME="81"></A>must use the evidence of sensible things); both excessive and defective 
<A NAME="82"></A>exercise destroys the strength, and similarly drink or food which is above 
<A NAME="83"></A>or below a certain amount destroys the health, while that which is proportionate 
<A NAME="84"></A>both produces and increases and preserves it. So too is it, then, in the 
<A NAME="85"></A>case of temperance and courage and the other virtues. For the man who flies 
<A NAME="86"></A>from and fears everything and does not stand his ground against anything 
<A NAME="87"></A>becomes a coward, and the man who fears nothing at all but goes to meet 
<A NAME="88"></A>every danger becomes rash; and similarly the man who indulges in every 
<A NAME="89"></A>pleasure and abstains from none becomes self-indulgent, while the man who 
<A NAME="90"></A>shuns every pleasure, as boors do, becomes in a way insensible; temperance 
<A NAME="91"></A>and courage, then, are destroyed by excess and defect, and preserved by 
<A NAME="92"></A>the mean.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>But not only are the sources and causes of their origination and 
<A NAME="94"></A>growth the same as those of their destruction, but also the sphere of their 
<A NAME="95"></A>actualization will be the same; for this is also true of the things which 
<A NAME="96"></A>are more evident to sense, e.g. of strength; it is produced by taking much 
<A NAME="97"></A>food and undergoing much exertion, and it is the strong man that will be 
<A NAME="98"></A>most able to do these things. So too is it with the virtues; by abstaining 
<A NAME="99"></A>from pleasures we become temperate, and it is when we have become so that 
<A NAME="100"></A>we are most able to abstain from them; and similarly too in the case of 
<A NAME="101"></A>courage; for by being habituated to despise things that are terrible and 
<A NAME="102"></A>to stand our ground against them we become brave, and it is when we have 
<A NAME="103"></A>become so that we shall be most able to stand our ground against 
<A NAME="104"></A>them.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>3
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>We must take as a sign of states of character the pleasure or pain 
<A NAME="107"></A>that ensues on acts; for the man who abstains from bodily pleasures and 
<A NAME="108"></A>delights in this very fact is temperate, while the man who is annoyed at 
<A NAME="109"></A>it is self-indulgent, and he who stands his ground against things that 
<A NAME="110"></A>are terrible and delights in this or at least is not pained is brave, while 
<A NAME="111"></A>the man who is pained is a coward. For moral excellence is concerned with 
<A NAME="112"></A>pleasures and pains; it is on account of the pleasure that we do bad things, 
<A NAME="113"></A>and on account of the pain that we abstain from noble ones. Hence we ought 
<A NAME="114"></A>to have been brought up in a particular way from our very youth, as Plato 
<A NAME="115"></A>says, so as both to delight in and to be pained by the things that we ought; 
<A NAME="116"></A>for this is the right education.
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>Again, if the virtues are concerned with actions and passions, 
<A NAME="118"></A>and every passion and every action is accompanied by pleasure and pain, 
<A NAME="119"></A>for this reason also virtue will be concerned with pleasures and pains. 
<A NAME="120"></A>This is indicated also by the fact that punishment is inflicted by these 
<A NAME="121"></A>means; for it is a kind of cure, and it is the nature of cures to be effected 
<A NAME="122"></A>by contraries.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>Again, as we said but lately, every state of soul has a nature 
<A NAME="124"></A>relative to and concerned with the kind of things by which it tends to 
<A NAME="125"></A>be made worse or better; but it is by reason of pleasures and pains that 
<A NAME="126"></A>men become bad, by pursuing and avoiding these- either the pleasures and 
<A NAME="127"></A>pains they ought not or when they ought not or as they ought not, or by 
<A NAME="128"></A>going wrong in one of the other similar ways that may be distinguished. 
<A NAME="129"></A>Hence men even define the virtues as certain states of impassivity and 
<A NAME="130"></A>rest; not well, however, because they speak absolutely, and do not say 
<A NAME="131"></A>'as one ought' and 'as one ought not' and 'when one ought or ought not', 
<A NAME="132"></A>and the other things that may be added. We assume, then, that this kind 
<A NAME="133"></A>of excellence tends to do what is best with regard to pleasures and pains, 
<A NAME="134"></A>and vice does the contrary.
<A NAME="135"></A><BR><BR>The following facts also may show us that virtue and vice are concerned 
<A NAME="136"></A>with these same things. There being three objects of choice and three of 
<A NAME="137"></A>avoidance, the noble, the advantageous, the pleasant, and their contraries, 
<A NAME="138"></A>the base, the injurious, the painful, about all of these the good man tends 
<A NAME="139"></A>to go right and the bad man to go wrong, and especially about pleasure; 
<A NAME="140"></A>for this is common to the animals, and also it accompanies all objects 
<A NAME="141"></A>of choice; for even the noble and the advantageous appear 
<A NAME="142"></A>pleasant.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>Again, it has grown up with us all from our infancy; this is why 
<A NAME="144"></A>it is difficult to rub off this passion, engrained as it is in our life. 
<A NAME="145"></A>And we measure even our actions, some of us more and others less, by the 
<A NAME="146"></A>rule of pleasure and pain. For this reason, then, our whole inquiry must 
<A NAME="147"></A>be about these; for to feel delight and pain rightly or wrongly has no 
<A NAME="148"></A>small effect on our actions.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>Again, it is harder to fight with pleasure than with anger, to 
<A NAME="150"></A>use Heraclitus' phrase', but both art and virtue are always concerned with 
<A NAME="151"></A>what is harder; for even the good is better when it is harder. Therefore 
<A NAME="152"></A>for this reason also the whole concern both of virtue and of political 
<A NAME="153"></A>science is with pleasures and pains; for the man who uses these well will 
<A NAME="154"></A>be good, he who uses them badly bad.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>That virtue, then, is concerned with pleasures and pains, and that 
<A NAME="156"></A>by the acts from which it arises it is both increased and, if they are 
<A NAME="157"></A>done differently, destroyed, and that the acts from which it arose are 
<A NAME="158"></A>those in which it actualizes itself- let this be taken as 
<A NAME="159"></A>said.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>4
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>The question might be asked,; what we mean by saying that we must 
<A NAME="162"></A>become just by doing just acts, and temperate by doing temperate acts; 
<A NAME="163"></A>for if men do just and temperate acts, they are already just and temperate, 
<A NAME="164"></A>exactly as, if they do what is in accordance with the laws of grammar and 
<A NAME="165"></A>of music, they are grammarians and musicians.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>Or is this not true even of the arts? It is possible to do something 
<A NAME="167"></A>that is in accordance with the laws of grammar, either by chance or at 
<A NAME="168"></A>the suggestion of another. A man will be a grammarian, then, only when 
<A NAME="169"></A>he has both done something grammatical and done it grammatically; and this 
<A NAME="170"></A>means doing it in accordance with the grammatical knowledge in 
<A NAME="171"></A>himself.
<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Again, the case of the arts and that of the virtues are not similar; 
<A NAME="173"></A>for the products of the arts have their goodness in themselves, so that 
<A NAME="174"></A>it is enough that they should have a certain character, but if the acts 
<A NAME="175"></A>that are in accordance with the virtues have themselves a certain character 
<A NAME="176"></A>it does not follow that they are done justly or temperately. The agent 
<A NAME="177"></A>also must be in a certain condition when he does them; in the first place 
<A NAME="178"></A>he must have knowledge, secondly he must choose the acts, and choose them 
<A NAME="179"></A>for their own sakes, and thirdly his action must proceed from a firm and 
<A NAME="180"></A>unchangeable character. These are not reckoned in as conditions of the 
<A NAME="181"></A>possession of the arts, except the bare knowledge; but as a condition of 
<A NAME="182"></A>the possession of the virtues knowledge has little or no weight, while 
<A NAME="183"></A>the other conditions count not for a little but for everything, i.e. the 
<A NAME="184"></A>very conditions which result from often doing just and temperate 
<A NAME="185"></A>acts.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>Actions, then, are called just and temperate when they are such 
<A NAME="187"></A>as the just or the temperate man would do; but it is not the man who does 
<A NAME="188"></A>these that is just and temperate, but the man who also does them as just 
<A NAME="189"></A>and temperate men do them. It is well said, then, that it is by doing just 
<A NAME="190"></A>acts that the just man is produced, and by doing temperate acts the temperate 
<A NAME="191"></A>man; without doing these no one would have even a prospect of becoming 
<A NAME="192"></A>good.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>But most people do not do these, but take refuge in theory and 
<A NAME="194"></A>think they are being philosophers and will become good in this way, behaving 
<A NAME="195"></A>somewhat like patients who listen attentively to their doctors, but do 
<A NAME="196"></A>none of the things they are ordered to do. As the latter will not be made 
<A NAME="197"></A>well in body by such a course of treatment, the former will not be made 
<A NAME="198"></A>well in soul by such a course of philosophy.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>5
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>Next we must consider what virtue is. Since things that are found 
<A NAME="201"></A>in the soul are of three kinds- passions, faculties, states of character, 
<A NAME="202"></A>virtue must be one of these. By passions I mean appetite, anger, fear, 
<A NAME="203"></A>confidence, envy, joy, friendly feeling, hatred, longing, emulation, pity, 
<A NAME="204"></A>and in general the feelings that are accompanied by pleasure or pain; by 
<A NAME="205"></A>faculties the things in virtue of which we are said to be capable of feeling 
<A NAME="206"></A>these, e.g. of becoming angry or being pained or feeling pity; by states 
<A NAME="207"></A>of character the things in virtue of which we stand well or badly with 
<A NAME="208"></A>reference to the passions, e.g. with reference to anger we stand badly 
<A NAME="209"></A>if we feel it violently or too weakly, and well if we feel it moderately; 
<A NAME="210"></A>and similarly with reference to the other passions.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>Now neither the virtues nor the vices are passions, because we 
<A NAME="212"></A>are not called good or bad on the ground of our passions, but are so called 
<A NAME="213"></A>on the ground of our virtues and our vices, and because we are neither 
<A NAME="214"></A>praised nor blamed for our passions (for the man who feels fear or anger 
<A NAME="215"></A>is not praised, nor is the man who simply feels anger blamed, but the man 
<A NAME="216"></A>who feels it in a certain way), but for our virtues and our vices we are 
<A NAME="217"></A>praised or blamed.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>Again, we feel anger and fear without choice, but the virtues are 
<A NAME="219"></A>modes of choice or involve choice. Further, in respect of the passions 
<A NAME="220"></A>we are said to be moved, but in respect of the virtues and the vices we 
<A NAME="221"></A>are said not to be moved but to be disposed in a particular 
<A NAME="222"></A>way.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>For these reasons also they are not faculties; for we are neither 
<A NAME="224"></A>called good nor bad, nor praised nor blamed, for the simple capacity of 
<A NAME="225"></A>feeling the passions; again, we have the faculties by nature, but we are 
<A NAME="226"></A>not made good or bad by nature; we have spoken of this before. If, then, 
<A NAME="227"></A>the virtues are neither passions nor faculties, all that remains is that 
<A NAME="228"></A>they should be states of character.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>Thus we have stated what virtue is in respect of its 
<A NAME="230"></A>genus.
<A NAME="231"></A><BR>6
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>We must, however, not only describe virtue as a state of character, 
<A NAME="233"></A>but also say what sort of state it is. We may remark, then, that every 
<A NAME="234"></A>virtue or excellence both brings into good condition the thing of which 
<A NAME="235"></A>it is the excellence and makes the work of that thing be done well; e.g. 
<A NAME="236"></A>the excellence of the eye makes both the eye and its work good; for it 
<A NAME="237"></A>is by the excellence of the eye that we see well. Similarly the excellence 
<A NAME="238"></A>of the horse makes a horse both good in itself and good at running and 
<A NAME="239"></A>at carrying its rider and at awaiting the attack of the enemy. Therefore, 
<A NAME="240"></A>if this is true in every case, the virtue of man also will be the state 
<A NAME="241"></A>of character which makes a man good and which makes him do his own work 
<A NAME="242"></A>well.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>How this is to happen we have stated already, but it will be made 
<A NAME="244"></A>plain also by the following consideration of the specific nature of virtue. 
<A NAME="245"></A>In everything that is continuous and divisible it is possible to take more, 
<A NAME="246"></A>less, or an equal amount, and that either in terms of the thing itself 
<A NAME="247"></A>or relatively to us; and the equal is an intermediate between excess and 
<A NAME="248"></A>defect. By the intermediate in the object I mean that which is equidistant 
<A NAME="249"></A>from each of the extremes, which is one and the same for all men; by the 
<A NAME="250"></A>intermediate relatively to us that which is neither too much nor too little- 
<A NAME="251"></A>and this is not one, nor the same for all. For instance, if ten is many 
<A NAME="252"></A>and two is few, six is the intermediate, taken in terms of the object; 
<A NAME="253"></A>for it exceeds and is exceeded by an equal amount; this is intermediate 
<A NAME="254"></A>according to arithmetical proportion. But the intermediate relatively to 
<A NAME="255"></A>us is not to be taken so; if ten pounds are too much for a particular person 
<A NAME="256"></A>to eat and two too little, it does not follow that the trainer will order 
<A NAME="257"></A>six pounds; for this also is perhaps too much for the person who is to 
<A NAME="258"></A>take it, or too little- too little for Milo, too much for the beginner 
<A NAME="259"></A>in athletic exercises. The same is true of running and wrestling. Thus 
<A NAME="260"></A>a master of any art avoids excess and defect, but seeks the intermediate 
<A NAME="261"></A>and chooses this- the intermediate not in the object but relatively to 
<A NAME="262"></A>us.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>If it is thus, then, that every art does its work well- by looking 
<A NAME="264"></A>to the intermediate and judgling its works by this standard (so that we 
<A NAME="265"></A>often say of good works of art that it is not possible either to take away 
<A NAME="266"></A>or to add anything, implying that excess and defect destroy the goodness 
<A NAME="267"></A>of works of art, while the mean preserves it; and good artists, as we say, 
<A NAME="268"></A>look to this in their work), and if, further, virtue is more exact and 
<A NAME="269"></A>better than any art, as nature also is, then virtue must have the quality 
<A NAME="270"></A>of aiming at the intermediate. I mean moral virtue; for it is this that 
<A NAME="271"></A>is concerned with passions and actions, and in these there is excess, defect, 
<A NAME="272"></A>and the intermediate. For instance, both fear and confidence and appetite 
<A NAME="273"></A>and anger and pity and in general pleasure and pain may be felt both too 
<A NAME="274"></A>much and too little, and in both cases not well; but to feel them at the 
<A NAME="275"></A>right times, with reference to the right objects, towards the right people, 
<A NAME="276"></A>with the right motive, and in the right way, is what is both intermediate 
<A NAME="277"></A>and best, and this is characteristic of virtue. Similarly with regard to 
<A NAME="278"></A>actions also there is excess, defect, and the intermediate. Now virtue 
<A NAME="279"></A>is concerned with passions and actions, in which excess is a form of failure, 
<A NAME="280"></A>and so is defect, while the intermediate is praised and is a form of success; 
<A NAME="281"></A>and being praised and being successful are both characteristics of virtue. 
<A NAME="282"></A>Therefore virtue is a kind of mean, since, as we have seen, it aims at 
<A NAME="283"></A>what is intermediate.
<A NAME="284"></A><BR><BR>Again, it is possible to fail in many ways (for evil belongs to 
<A NAME="285"></A>the class of the unlimited, as the Pythagoreans conjectured, and good to 
<A NAME="286"></A>that of the limited), while to succeed is possible only in one way (for 
<A NAME="287"></A>which reason also one is easy and the other difficult- to miss the mark 
<A NAME="288"></A>easy, to hit it difficult); for these reasons also, then, excess and defect 
<A NAME="289"></A>are characteristic of vice, and the mean of virtue;
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>For men are good in but one way, but bad in 
<A NAME="291"></A>many.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>Virtue, then, is a state of character concerned with choice, lying 
<A NAME="293"></A>in a mean, i.e. the mean relative to us, this being determined by a rational 
<A NAME="294"></A>principle, and by that principle by which the man of practical wisdom would 
<A NAME="295"></A>determine it. Now it is a mean between two vices, that which depends on 
<A NAME="296"></A>excess and that which depends on defect; and again it is a mean because 
<A NAME="297"></A>the vices respectively fall short of or exceed what is right in both passions 
<A NAME="298"></A>and actions, while virtue both finds and chooses that which is intermediate. 
<A NAME="299"></A>Hence in respect of its substance and the definition which states its essence 
<A NAME="300"></A>virtue is a mean, with regard to what is best and right an 
<A NAME="301"></A>extreme.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>But not every action nor every passion admits of a mean; for some 
<A NAME="303"></A>have names that already imply badness, e.g. spite, shamelessness, envy, 
<A NAME="304"></A>and in the case of actions adultery, theft, murder; for all of these and 
<A NAME="305"></A>suchlike things imply by their names that they are themselves bad, and 
<A NAME="306"></A>not the excesses or deficiencies of them. It is not possible, then, ever 
<A NAME="307"></A>to be right with regard to them; one must always be wrong. Nor does goodness 
<A NAME="308"></A>or badness with regard to such things depend on committing adultery with 
<A NAME="309"></A>the right woman, at the right time, and in the right way, but simply to 
<A NAME="310"></A>do any of them is to go wrong. It would be equally absurd, then, to expect 
<A NAME="311"></A>that in unjust, cowardly, and voluptuous action there should be a mean, 
<A NAME="312"></A>an excess, and a deficiency; for at that rate there would be a mean of 
<A NAME="313"></A>excess and of deficiency, an excess of excess, and a deficiency of deficiency. 
<A NAME="314"></A>But as there is no excess and deficiency of temperance and courage because 
<A NAME="315"></A>what is intermediate is in a sense an extreme, so too of the actions we 
<A NAME="316"></A>have mentioned there is no mean nor any excess and deficiency, but however 
<A NAME="317"></A>they are done they are wrong; for in general there is neither a mean of 
<A NAME="318"></A>excess and deficiency, nor excess and deficiency of a 
<A NAME="319"></A>mean.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>7
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>We must, however, not only make this general statement, but also 
<A NAME="322"></A>apply it to the individual facts. For among statements about conduct those 
<A NAME="323"></A>which are general apply more widely, but those which are particular are 
<A NAME="324"></A>more genuine, since conduct has to do with individual cases, and our statements 
<A NAME="325"></A>must harmonize with the facts in these cases. We may take these cases from 
<A NAME="326"></A>our table. With regard to feelings of fear and confidence courage is the 
<A NAME="327"></A>mean; of the people who exceed, he who exceeds in fearlessness has no name 
<A NAME="328"></A>(many of the states have no name), while the man who exceeds in confidence 
<A NAME="329"></A>is rash, and he who exceeds in fear and falls short in confidence is a 
<A NAME="330"></A>coward. With regard to pleasures and pains- not all of them, and not so 
<A NAME="331"></A>much with regard to the pains- the mean is temperance, the excess self-indulgence. 
<A NAME="332"></A>Persons deficient with regard to the pleasures are not often found; hence 
<A NAME="333"></A>such persons also have received no name. But let us call them 
<A NAME="334"></A>'insensible'.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>With regard to giving and taking of money the mean is liberality, 
<A NAME="336"></A>the excess and the defect prodigality and meanness. In these actions people 
<A NAME="337"></A>exceed and fall short in contrary ways; the prodigal exceeds in spending 
<A NAME="338"></A>and falls short in taking, while the mean man exceeds in taking and falls 
<A NAME="339"></A>short in spending. (At present we are giving a mere outline or summary, 
<A NAME="340"></A>and are satisfied with this; later these states will be more exactly determined.) 
<A NAME="341"></A>With regard to money there are also other dispositions- a mean, magnificence 
<A NAME="342"></A>(for the magnificent man differs from the liberal man; the former deals 
<A NAME="343"></A>with large sums, the latter with small ones), an excess, tastelessness 
<A NAME="344"></A>and vulgarity, and a deficiency, niggardliness; these differ from the states 
<A NAME="345"></A>opposed to liberality, and the mode of their difference will be stated 
<A NAME="346"></A>later. With regard to honour and dishonour the mean is proper pride, the 
<A NAME="347"></A>excess is known as a sort of 'empty vanity', and the deficiency is undue 
<A NAME="348"></A>humility; and as we said liberality was related to magnificence, differing 
<A NAME="349"></A>from it by dealing with small sums, so there is a state similarly related 
<A NAME="350"></A>to proper pride, being concerned with small honours while that is concerned 
<A NAME="351"></A>with great. For it is possible to desire honour as one ought, and more 
<A NAME="352"></A>than one ought, and less, and the man who exceeds in his desires is called 
<A NAME="353"></A>ambitious, the man who falls short unambitious, while the intermediate 
<A NAME="354"></A>person has no name. The dispositions also are nameless, except that that 
<A NAME="355"></A>of the ambitious man is called ambition. Hence the people who are at the 
<A NAME="356"></A>extremes lay claim to the middle place; and we ourselves sometimes call 
<A NAME="357"></A>the intermediate person ambitious and sometimes unambitious, and sometimes 
<A NAME="358"></A>praise the ambitious man and sometimes the unambitious. The reason of our 
<A NAME="359"></A>doing this will be stated in what follows; but now let us speak of the 
<A NAME="360"></A>remaining states according to the method which has been 
<A NAME="361"></A>indicated.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>With regard to anger also there is an excess, a deficiency, and 
<A NAME="363"></A>a mean. Although they can scarcely be said to have names, yet since we 
<A NAME="364"></A>call the intermediate person good-tempered let us call the mean good temper; 
<A NAME="365"></A>of the persons at the extremes let the one who exceeds be called irascible, 
<A NAME="366"></A>and his vice irascibility, and the man who falls short an inirascible sort 
<A NAME="367"></A>of person, and the deficiency inirascibility.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>There are also three other means, which have a certain likeness 
<A NAME="369"></A>to one another, but differ from one another: for they are all concerned 
<A NAME="370"></A>with intercourse in words and actions, but differ in that one is concerned 
<A NAME="371"></A>with truth in this sphere, the other two with pleasantness; and of this 
<A NAME="372"></A>one kind is exhibited in giving amusement, the other in all the circumstances 
<A NAME="373"></A>of life. We must therefore speak of these too, that we may the better see 
<A NAME="374"></A>that in all things the mean is praise-worthy, and the extremes neither 
<A NAME="375"></A>praiseworthy nor right, but worthy of blame. Now most of these states also 
<A NAME="376"></A>have no names, but we must try, as in the other cases, to invent names 
<A NAME="377"></A>ourselves so that we may be clear and easy to follow. With regard to truth, 
<A NAME="378"></A>then, the intermediate is a truthful sort of person and the mean may be 
<A NAME="379"></A>called truthfulness, while the pretence which exaggerates is boastfulness 
<A NAME="380"></A>and the person characterized by it a boaster, and that which understates 
<A NAME="381"></A>is mock modesty and the person characterized by it mock-modest. With regard 
<A NAME="382"></A>to pleasantness in the giving of amusement the intermediate person is ready-witted 
<A NAME="383"></A>and the disposition ready wit, the excess is buffoonery and the person 
<A NAME="384"></A>characterized by it a buffoon, while the man who falls short is a sort 
<A NAME="385"></A>of boor and his state is boorishness. With regard to the remaining kind 
<A NAME="386"></A>of pleasantness, that which is exhibited in life in general, the man who 
<A NAME="387"></A>is pleasant in the right way is friendly and the mean is friendliness, 
<A NAME="388"></A>while the man who exceeds is an obsequious person if he has no end in view, 
<A NAME="389"></A>a flatterer if he is aiming at his own advantage, and the man who falls 
<A NAME="390"></A>short and is unpleasant in all circumstances is a quarrelsome and surly 
<A NAME="391"></A>sort of person.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>There are also means in the passions and concerned with the passions; 
<A NAME="393"></A>since shame is not a virtue, and yet praise is extended to the modest man. 
<A NAME="394"></A>For even in these matters one man is said to be intermediate, and another 
<A NAME="395"></A>to exceed, as for instance the bashful man who is ashamed of everything; 
<A NAME="396"></A>while he who falls short or is not ashamed of anything at all is shameless, 
<A NAME="397"></A>and the intermediate person is modest. Righteous indignation is a mean 
<A NAME="398"></A>between envy and spite, and these states are concerned with the pain and 
<A NAME="399"></A>pleasure that are felt at the fortunes of our neighbours; the man who is 
<A NAME="400"></A>characterized by righteous indignation is pained at undeserved good fortune, 
<A NAME="401"></A>the envious man, going beyond him, is pained at all good fortune, and the 
<A NAME="402"></A>spiteful man falls so far short of being pained that he even rejoices. 
<A NAME="403"></A>But these states there will be an opportunity of describing elsewhere; 
<A NAME="404"></A>with regard to justice, since it has not one simple meaning, we shall, 
<A NAME="405"></A>after describing the other states, distinguish its two kinds and say how 
<A NAME="406"></A>each of them is a mean; and similarly we shall treat also of the rational 
<A NAME="407"></A>virtues.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>8
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>There are three kinds of disposition, then, two of them vices, 
<A NAME="410"></A>involving excess and deficiency respectively, and one a virtue, viz. the 
<A NAME="411"></A>mean, and all are in a sense opposed to all; for the extreme states are 
<A NAME="412"></A>contrary both to the intermediate state and to each other, and the intermediate 
<A NAME="413"></A>to the extremes; as the equal is greater relatively to the less, less relatively 
<A NAME="414"></A>to the greater, so the middle states are excessive relatively to the deficiencies, 
<A NAME="415"></A>deficient relatively to the excesses, both in passions and in actions. 
<A NAME="416"></A>For the brave man appears rash relatively to the coward, and cowardly relatively 
<A NAME="417"></A>to the rash man; and similarly the temperate man appears self-indulgent 
<A NAME="418"></A>relatively to the insensible man, insensible relatively to the self-indulgent, 
<A NAME="419"></A>and the liberal man prodigal relatively to the mean man, mean relatively 
<A NAME="420"></A>to the prodigal. Hence also the people at the extremes push the intermediate 
<A NAME="421"></A>man each over to the other, and the brave man is called rash by the coward, 
<A NAME="422"></A>cowardly by the rash man, and correspondingly in the other 
<A NAME="423"></A>cases.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>These states being thus opposed to one another, the greatest contrariety 
<A NAME="425"></A>is that of the extremes to each other, rather than to the intermediate; 
<A NAME="426"></A>for these are further from each other than from the intermediate, as the 
<A NAME="427"></A>great is further from the small and the small from the great than both 
<A NAME="428"></A>are from the equal. Again, to the intermediate some extremes show a certain 
<A NAME="429"></A>likeness, as that of rashness to courage and that of prodigality to liberality; 
<A NAME="430"></A>but the extremes show the greatest unlikeness to each other; now contraries 
<A NAME="431"></A>are defined as the things that are furthest from each other, so that things 
<A NAME="432"></A>that are further apart are more contrary.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>To the mean in some cases the deficiency, in some the excess is 
<A NAME="434"></A>more opposed; e.g. it is not rashness, which is an excess, but cowardice, 
<A NAME="435"></A>which is a deficiency, that is more opposed to courage, and not insensibility, 
<A NAME="436"></A>which is a deficiency, but self-indulgence, which is an excess, that is 
<A NAME="437"></A>more opposed to temperance. This happens from two reasons, one being drawn 
<A NAME="438"></A>from the thing itself; for because one extreme is nearer and liker to the 
<A NAME="439"></A>intermediate, we oppose not this but rather its contrary to the intermediate. 
<A NAME="440"></A>E.g. since rashness is thought liker and nearer to courage, and cowardice 
<A NAME="441"></A>more unlike, we oppose rather the latter to courage; for things that are 
<A NAME="442"></A>further from the intermediate are thought more contrary to it. This, then, 
<A NAME="443"></A>is one cause, drawn from the thing itself; another is drawn from ourselves; 
<A NAME="444"></A>for the things to which we ourselves more naturally tend seem more contrary 
<A NAME="445"></A>to the intermediate. For instance, we ourselves tend more naturally to 
<A NAME="446"></A>pleasures, and hence are more easily carried away towards self-indulgence 
<A NAME="447"></A>than towards propriety. We describe as contrary to the mean, then, rather 
<A NAME="448"></A>the directions in which we more often go to great lengths; and therefore 
<A NAME="449"></A>self-indulgence, which is an excess, is the more contrary to 
<A NAME="450"></A>temperance.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>9
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>That moral virtue is a mean, then, and in what sense it is so, 
<A NAME="453"></A>and that it is a mean between two vices, the one involving excess, the 
<A NAME="454"></A>other deficiency, and that it is such because its character is to aim at 
<A NAME="455"></A>what is intermediate in passions and in actions, has been sufficiently 
<A NAME="456"></A>stated. Hence also it is no easy task to be good. For in everything it 
<A NAME="457"></A>is no easy task to find the middle, e.g. to find the middle of a circle 
<A NAME="458"></A>is not for every one but for him who knows; so, too, any one can get angry- 
<A NAME="459"></A>that is easy- or give or spend money; but to do this to the right person, 
<A NAME="460"></A>to the right extent, at the right time, with the right motive, and in the 
<A NAME="461"></A>right way, that is not for every one, nor is it easy; wherefore goodness 
<A NAME="462"></A>is both rare and laudable and noble.
<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>Hence he who aims at the intermediate must first depart from what 
<A NAME="464"></A>is the more contrary to it, as Calypso advises-
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>Hold the ship out beyond that surf and spray.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR>For of the extremes one is more erroneous, one less so; therefore, 
<A NAME="467"></A>since to hit the mean is hard in the extreme, we must as a second best, 
<A NAME="468"></A>as people say, take the least of the evils; and this will be done best 
<A NAME="469"></A>in the way we describe. But we must consider the things towards which we 
<A NAME="470"></A>ourselves also are easily carried away; for some of us tend to one thing, 
<A NAME="471"></A>some to another; and this will be recognizable from the pleasure and the 
<A NAME="472"></A>pain we feel. We must drag ourselves away to the contrary extreme; for 
<A NAME="473"></A>we shall get into the intermediate state by drawing well away from error, 
<A NAME="474"></A>as people do in straightening sticks that are bent.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR>Now in everything the pleasant or pleasure is most to be guarded 
<A NAME="476"></A>against; for we do not judge it impartially. We ought, then, to feel towards 
<A NAME="477"></A>pleasure as the elders of the people felt towards Helen, and in all circumstances 
<A NAME="478"></A>repeat their saying; for if we dismiss pleasure thus we are less likely 
<A NAME="479"></A>to go astray. It is by doing this, then, (to sum the matter up) that we 
<A NAME="480"></A>shall best be able to hit the mean.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR>But this is no doubt difficult, and especially in individual cases; 
<A NAME="482"></A>for or is not easy to determine both how and with whom and on what provocation 
<A NAME="483"></A>and how long one should be angry; for we too sometimes praise those who 
<A NAME="484"></A>fall short and call them good-tempered, but sometimes we praise those who 
<A NAME="485"></A>get angry and call them manly. The man, however, who deviates little from 
<A NAME="486"></A>goodness is not blamed, whether he do so in the direction of the more or 
<A NAME="487"></A>of the less, but only the man who deviates more widely; for he does not 
<A NAME="488"></A>fail to be noticed. But up to what point and to what extent a man must 
<A NAME="489"></A>deviate before he becomes blameworthy it is not easy to determine by reasoning, 
<A NAME="490"></A>any more than anything else that is perceived by the senses; such things 
<A NAME="491"></A>depend on particular facts, and the decision rests with perception. So 
<A NAME="492"></A>much, then, is plain, that the intermediate state is in all things to be 
<A NAME="493"></A>praised, but that we must incline sometimes towards the excess, sometimes 
<A NAME="494"></A>towards the deficiency; for so shall we most easily hit the mean and what 
<A NAME="495"></A>is right.
