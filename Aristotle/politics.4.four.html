<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part I</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>In all arts and sciences which embrace the whole of any subject, and do 
<A NAME="12"></A>not come into being in a fragmentary way, it is the province of a single 
<A NAME="13"></A>art or science to consider all that appertains to a single subject. For 
<A NAME="14"></A>example, the art of gymnastic considers not only the suitableness of different 
<A NAME="15"></A>modes of training to different bodies (2), but what sort is absolutely 
<A NAME="16"></A>the best (1); (for the absolutely best must suit that which is by nature 
<A NAME="17"></A>best and best furnished with the means of life), and also what common form 
<A NAME="18"></A>of training is adapted to the great majority of men (4). And if a man does 
<A NAME="19"></A>not desire the best habit of body, or the greatest skill in gymnastics, 
<A NAME="20"></A>which might be attained by him, still the trainer or the teacher of gymnastic 
<A NAME="21"></A>should be able to impart any lower degree of either (3). The same principle 
<A NAME="22"></A>equally holds in medicine and shipbuilding, and the making of clothes, 
<A NAME="23"></A>and in the arts generally.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>Hence it is obvious that government too is the subject of a single 
<A NAME="25"></A>science, which has to consider what government is best and of what sort 
<A NAME="26"></A>it must be, to be most in accordance with our aspirations, if there were 
<A NAME="27"></A>no external impediment, and also what kind of government is adapted to 
<A NAME="28"></A>particular states. For the best is often unattainable, and therefore the 
<A NAME="29"></A>true legislator and statesman ought to be acquainted, not only with (1) 
<A NAME="30"></A>that which is best in the abstract, but also with (2) that which is best 
<A NAME="31"></A>relatively to circumstances. We should be able further to say how a state 
<A NAME="32"></A>may be constituted under any given conditions (3); both how it is originally 
<A NAME="33"></A>formed and, when formed, how it may be longest preserved; the supposed 
<A NAME="34"></A>state being so far from having the best constitution that it is unprovided 
<A NAME="35"></A>even with the conditions necessary for the best; neither is it the best 
<A NAME="36"></A>under the circumstances, but of an inferior type.
<A NAME="37"></A><BR><BR>He ought, moreover, to know (4) the form of government which is 
<A NAME="38"></A>best suited to states in general; for political writers, although they 
<A NAME="39"></A>have excellent ideas, are often unpractical. We should consider, not only 
<A NAME="40"></A>what form of government is best, but also what is possible and what is 
<A NAME="41"></A>easily attainable by all. There are some who would have none but the most 
<A NAME="42"></A>perfect; for this many natural advantages are required. Others, again, 
<A NAME="43"></A>speak of a more attainable form, and, although they reject the constitution 
<A NAME="44"></A>under which they are living, they extol some one in particular, for example 
<A NAME="45"></A>the Lacedaemonian. Any change of government which has to be introduced 
<A NAME="46"></A>should be one which men, starting from their existing constitutions, will 
<A NAME="47"></A>be both willing and able to adopt, since there is quite as much trouble 
<A NAME="48"></A>in the reformation of an old constitution as in the establishment of a 
<A NAME="49"></A>new one, just as to unlearn is as hard as to learn. And therefore, in addition 
<A NAME="50"></A>to the qualifications of the statesman already mentioned, he should be 
<A NAME="51"></A>able to find remedies for the defects of existing constitutions, as has 
<A NAME="52"></A>been said before. This he cannot do unless he knows how many forms of government 
<A NAME="53"></A>there are. It is often supposed that there is only one kind of democracy 
<A NAME="54"></A>and one of oligarchy. But this is a mistake; and, in order to avoid such 
<A NAME="55"></A>mistakes, we must ascertain what differences there are in the constitutions 
<A NAME="56"></A>of states, and in how many ways they are combined. The same political insight 
<A NAME="57"></A>will enable a man to know which laws are the best, and which are suited 
<A NAME="58"></A>to different constitutions; for the laws are, and ought to be, relative 
<A NAME="59"></A>to the constitution, and not the constitution to the laws. A constitution 
<A NAME="60"></A>is the organization of offices in a state, and determines what is to be 
<A NAME="61"></A>the governing body, and what is the end of each community. But laws are 
<A NAME="62"></A>not to be confounded with the principles of the constitution; they are 
<A NAME="63"></A>the rules according to which the magistrates should administer the state, 
<A NAME="64"></A>and proceed against offenders. So that we must know the varieties, and 
<A NAME="65"></A>the number of varieties, of each form of government, if only with a view 
<A NAME="66"></A>to making laws. For the same laws cannot be equally suited to all oligarchies 
<A NAME="67"></A>or to all democracies, since there is certainly more than one form both 
<A NAME="68"></A>of democracy and of oligarchy.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="69"></A><B>Part II</B>

<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>In our original discussion about governments we divided them into 
<A NAME="71"></A>three true forms: kingly rule, aristocracy, and constitutional government, 
<A NAME="72"></A>and three corresponding perversions- tyranny, oligarchy, and democracy. 
<A NAME="73"></A>Of kingly rule and of aristocracy, we have already spoken, for the inquiry 
<A NAME="74"></A>into the perfect state is the same thing with the discussion of the two 
<A NAME="75"></A>forms thus named, since both imply a principle of virtue provided with 
<A NAME="76"></A>external means. We have already determined in what aristocracy and kingly 
<A NAME="77"></A>rule differ from one another, and when the latter should be established. 
<A NAME="78"></A>In what follows we have to describe the so-called constitutional government, 
<A NAME="79"></A>which bears the common name of all constitutions, and the other forms, 
<A NAME="80"></A>tyranny, oligarchy, and democracy.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>It is obvious which of the three perversions is the worst, and 
<A NAME="82"></A>which is the next in badness. That which is the perversion of the first 
<A NAME="83"></A>and most divine is necessarily the worst. And just as a royal rule, if 
<A NAME="84"></A>not a mere name, must exist by virtue of some great personal superiority 
<A NAME="85"></A>in the king, so tyranny, which is the worst of governments, is necessarily 
<A NAME="86"></A>the farthest removed from a well-constituted form; oligarchy is little 
<A NAME="87"></A>better, for it is a long way from aristocracy, and democracy is the most 
<A NAME="88"></A>tolerable of the three.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>A writer who preceded me has already made these distinctions, but 
<A NAME="90"></A>his point of view is not the same as mine. For he lays down the principle 
<A NAME="91"></A>that when all the constitutions are good (the oligarchy and the rest being 
<A NAME="92"></A>virtuous), democracy is the worst, but the best when all are bad. Whereas 
<A NAME="93"></A>we maintain that they are in any case defective, and that one oligarchy 
<A NAME="94"></A>is not to be accounted better than another, but only less 
<A NAME="95"></A>bad.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>Not to pursue this question further at present, let us begin by 
<A NAME="97"></A>determining (1) how many varieties of constitution there are (since of 
<A NAME="98"></A>democracy and oligarchy there are several): (2) what constitution is the 
<A NAME="99"></A>most generally acceptable, and what is eligible in the next degree after 
<A NAME="100"></A>the perfect state; and besides this what other there is which is aristocratical 
<A NAME="101"></A>and well-constituted, and at the same time adapted to states in general; 
<A NAME="102"></A>(3) of the other forms of government to whom each is suited. For democracy 
<A NAME="103"></A>may meet the needs of some better than oligarchy, and conversely. In the 
<A NAME="104"></A>next place (4) we have to consider in what manner a man ought to proceed 
<A NAME="105"></A>who desires to establish some one among these various forms, whether of 
<A NAME="106"></A>democracy or of oligarchy; and lastly, (5) having briefly discussed these 
<A NAME="107"></A>subjects to the best of our power, we will endeavor to ascertain the modes 
<A NAME="108"></A>of ruin and preservation both of constitutions generally and of each separately, 
<A NAME="109"></A>and to what causes they are to be attributed.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="110"></A><B>Part III</B>

<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>The reason why there are many forms of government is that every 
<A NAME="112"></A>state contains many elements. In the first place we see that all states 
<A NAME="113"></A>are made up of families, and in the multitude of citizen there must be 
<A NAME="114"></A>some rich and some poor, and some in a middle condition; the rich are heavy-armed, 
<A NAME="115"></A>and the poor not. Of the common people, some are husbandmen, and some traders, 
<A NAME="116"></A>and some artisans. There are also among the notables differences of wealth 
<A NAME="117"></A>and property- for example, in the number of horses which they keep, for 
<A NAME="118"></A>they cannot afford to keep them unless they are rich. And therefore in 
<A NAME="119"></A>old times the cities whose strength lay in their cavalry were oligarchies, 
<A NAME="120"></A>and they used cavalry in wars against their neighbors; as was the practice 
<A NAME="121"></A>of the Eretrians and Chalcidians, and also of the Magnesians on the river 
<A NAME="122"></A>Maeander, and of other peoples in Asia. Besides differences of wealth there 
<A NAME="123"></A>are differences of rank and merit, and there are some other elements which 
<A NAME="124"></A>were mentioned by us when in treating of aristocracy we enumerated the 
<A NAME="125"></A>essentials of a state. Of these elements, sometimes all, sometimes the 
<A NAME="126"></A>lesser and sometimes the greater number, have a share in the government. 
<A NAME="127"></A>It is evident then that there must be many forms of government, differing 
<A NAME="128"></A>in kind, since the parts of which they are composed differ from each other 
<A NAME="129"></A>in kind. For a constitution is an organization of offices, which all the 
<A NAME="130"></A>citizens distribute among themselves, according to the power which different 
<A NAME="131"></A>classes possess, for example the rich or the poor, or according to some 
<A NAME="132"></A>principle of equality which includes both. There must therefore be as many 
<A NAME="133"></A>forms of government as there are modes of arranging the offices, according 
<A NAME="134"></A>to the superiorities and differences of the parts of the 
<A NAME="135"></A>state.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>There are generally thought to be two principal forms: as men say 
<A NAME="137"></A>of the winds that there are but two- north and south, and that the rest 
<A NAME="138"></A>of them are only variations of these, so of governments there are said 
<A NAME="139"></A>to be only two forms- democracy and oligarchy. For aristocracy is considered 
<A NAME="140"></A>to be a kind of oligarchy, as being the rule of a few, and the so-called 
<A NAME="141"></A>constitutional government to be really a democracy, just as among the winds 
<A NAME="142"></A>we make the west a variation of the north, and the east of the south wind. 
<A NAME="143"></A>Similarly of musical modes there are said to be two kinds, the Dorian and 
<A NAME="144"></A>the Phrygian; the other arrangements of the scale are comprehended under 
<A NAME="145"></A>one or other of these two. About forms of government this is a very favorite 
<A NAME="146"></A>notion. But in either case the better and more exact way is to distinguish, 
<A NAME="147"></A>as I have done, the one or two which are true forms, and to regard the 
<A NAME="148"></A>others as perversions, whether of the most perfectly attempered mode or 
<A NAME="149"></A>of the best form of government: we may compare the severer and more overpowering 
<A NAME="150"></A>modes to the oligarchical forms, and the more relaxed and gentler ones 
<A NAME="151"></A>to the democratic.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="152"></A><B>Part IV</B>

<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>It must not be assumed, as some are fond of saying, that democracy 
<A NAME="154"></A>is simply that form of government in which the greater number are sovereign, 
<A NAME="155"></A>for in oligarchies, and indeed in every government, the majority rules; 
<A NAME="156"></A>nor again is oligarchy that form of government in which a few are sovereign. 
<A NAME="157"></A>Suppose the whole population of a city to be 1300, and that of these 1000 
<A NAME="158"></A>are rich, and do not allow the remaining 300 who are poor, but free, and 
<A NAME="159"></A>in an other respects their equals, a share of the government- no one will 
<A NAME="160"></A>say that this is a democracy. In like manner, if the poor were few and 
<A NAME="161"></A>the masters of the rich who outnumber them, no one would ever call such 
<A NAME="162"></A>a government, in which the rich majority have no share of office, an oligarchy. 
<A NAME="163"></A>Therefore we should rather say that democracy is the form of government 
<A NAME="164"></A>in which the free are rulers, and oligarchy in which the rich; it is only 
<A NAME="165"></A>an accident that the free are the many and the rich are the few. Otherwise 
<A NAME="166"></A>a government in which the offices were given according to stature, as is 
<A NAME="167"></A>said to be the case in Ethiopia, or according to beauty, would be an oligarchy; 
<A NAME="168"></A>for the number of tall or good-looking men is small. And yet oligarchy 
<A NAME="169"></A>and democracy are not sufficiently distinguished merely by these two characteristics 
<A NAME="170"></A>of wealth and freedom. Both of them contain many other elements, and therefore 
<A NAME="171"></A>we must carry our analysis further, and say that the government is not 
<A NAME="172"></A>a democracy in which the freemen, being few in number, rule over the many 
<A NAME="173"></A>who are not free, as at Apollonia, on the Ionian Gulf, and at Thera; (for 
<A NAME="174"></A>in each of these states the nobles, who were also the earliest settlers, 
<A NAME="175"></A>were held in chief honor, although they were but a few out of many). Neither 
<A NAME="176"></A>is it a democracy when the rich have the government because they exceed 
<A NAME="177"></A>in number; as was the case formerly at Colophon, where the bulk of the 
<A NAME="178"></A>inhabitants were possessed of large property before the Lydian War. But 
<A NAME="179"></A>the form of government is a democracy when the free, who are also poor 
<A NAME="180"></A>and the majority, govern, and an oligarchy when the rich and the noble 
<A NAME="181"></A>govern, they being at the same time few in number.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>I have said that there are many forms of government, and have explained 
<A NAME="183"></A>to what causes the variety is due. Why there are more than those already 
<A NAME="184"></A>mentioned, and what they are, and whence they arise, I will now proceed 
<A NAME="185"></A>to consider, starting from the principle already admitted, which is that 
<A NAME="186"></A>every state consists, not of one, but of many parts. If we were going to 
<A NAME="187"></A>speak of the different species of animals, we should first of all determine 
<A NAME="188"></A>the organs which are indispensable to every animal, as for example some 
<A NAME="189"></A>organs of sense and the instruments of receiving and digesting food, such 
<A NAME="190"></A>as the mouth and the stomach, besides organs of locomotion. Assuming now 
<A NAME="191"></A>that there are only so many kinds of organs, but that there may be differences 
<A NAME="192"></A>in them- I mean different kinds of mouths, and stomachs, and perceptive 
<A NAME="193"></A>and locomotive organs- the possible combinations of these differences will 
<A NAME="194"></A>necessarily furnish many variedes of animals. (For animals cannot be the 
<A NAME="195"></A>same which have different kinds of mouths or of ears.) And when all the 
<A NAME="196"></A>combinations are exhausted, there will be as many sorts of animals as there 
<A NAME="197"></A>are combinations of the necessary organs. The same, then, is true of the 
<A NAME="198"></A>forms of government which have been described; states, as I have repeatedly 
<A NAME="199"></A>said, are composed, not of one, but of many elements. One element is the 
<A NAME="200"></A>food-producing class, who are called husbandmen; a second, the class of 
<A NAME="201"></A>mechanics who practice the arts without which a city cannot exist; of these 
<A NAME="202"></A>arts some are absolutely necessary, others contribute to luxury or to the 
<A NAME="203"></A>grace of life. The third class is that of traders, and by traders I mean 
<A NAME="204"></A>those who are engaged in buying and selling, whether in commerce or in 
<A NAME="205"></A>retail trade. A fourth class is that of the serfs or laborers. The warriors 
<A NAME="206"></A>make up the fifth class, and they are as necessary as any of the others, 
<A NAME="207"></A>if the country is not to be the slave of every invader. For how can a state 
<A NAME="208"></A>which has any title to the name be of a slavish nature? The state is independent 
<A NAME="209"></A>and self-sufficing, but a slave is the reverse of independent. Hence we 
<A NAME="210"></A>see that this subject, though ingeniously, has not been satisfactorily 
<A NAME="211"></A>treated in the Republic. Socrates says that a state is made up of four 
<A NAME="212"></A>sorts of people who are absolutely necessary; these are a weaver, a husbandman, 
<A NAME="213"></A>a shoemaker, and a builder; afterwards, finding that they are not enough, 
<A NAME="214"></A>he adds a smith, and again a herdsman, to look after the necessary animals; 
<A NAME="215"></A>then a merchant, and then a retail trader. All these together form the 
<A NAME="216"></A>complement of the first state, as if a state were established merely to 
<A NAME="217"></A>supply the necessaries of life, rather than for the sake of the good, or 
<A NAME="218"></A>stood equally in need of shoemakers and of husbandmen. But he does not 
<A NAME="219"></A>admit into the state a military class until the country has increased in 
<A NAME="220"></A>size, and is beginning to encroach on its neighbor's land, whereupon they 
<A NAME="221"></A>go to war. Yet even amongst his four original citizens, or whatever be 
<A NAME="222"></A>the number of those whom he associates in the state, there must be some 
<A NAME="223"></A>one who will dispense justice and determine what is just. And as the soul 
<A NAME="224"></A>may be said to be more truly part of an animal than the body, so the higher 
<A NAME="225"></A>parts of states, that is to say, the warrior class, the class engaged in 
<A NAME="226"></A>the administration of justice, and that engaged in deliberation, which 
<A NAME="227"></A>is the special business of political common sense-these are more essential 
<A NAME="228"></A>to the state than the parts which  minister to the necessaries of life. 
<A NAME="229"></A>Whether their several functions are the functions of different citizens, 
<A NAME="230"></A>or of the same- for it may often happen that the same persons are both 
<A NAME="231"></A>warriors and husbandmen- is immaterial to the argument. The higher as well 
<A NAME="232"></A>as the lower elements are to be equally considered parts of the state, 
<A NAME="233"></A>and if so, the military element at any rate must be included. There are 
<A NAME="234"></A>also the wealthy who minister to the state with their property; these form 
<A NAME="235"></A>the seventh class. The eighth class is that of magistrates and of officers; 
<A NAME="236"></A>for the state cannot exist without rulers. And therefore some must be able 
<A NAME="237"></A>to take office and to serve the state, either always or in turn. There 
<A NAME="238"></A>only remains the class of those who deliberate and who judge between disputants; 
<A NAME="239"></A>we were just now distinguishing them. If presence of all these elements, 
<A NAME="240"></A>and their fair and equitable organization, is necessary to states, then 
<A NAME="241"></A>there must also be persons who have the ability of statesmen. Different 
<A NAME="242"></A>functions appear to be often combined in the same individual; for example, 
<A NAME="243"></A>the warrior may also be a husbandman, or an artisan; or, again, the councillor 
<A NAME="244"></A>a judge. And all claim to possess political ability, and think that they 
<A NAME="245"></A>are quite competent to fill most offices. But the same persons cannot be 
<A NAME="246"></A>rich and poor at the same time. For this reason the rich and the poor are 
<A NAME="247"></A>regarded in an especial sense as parts of a state. Again, because the rich 
<A NAME="248"></A>are generally few in number, while the poor are many, they appear to be 
<A NAME="249"></A>antagonistic, and as the one or the other prevails they form the government. 
<A NAME="250"></A>Hence arises the common opinion that there are two kinds of government- 
<A NAME="251"></A>democracy and oligarchy.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>I have already explained that there are many forms of constitution, 
<A NAME="253"></A>and to what causes the variety is due. Let me now show that there are different 
<A NAME="254"></A>forms both of democracy and oligarchy, as will indeed be evident from what 
<A NAME="255"></A>has preceded. For both in the common people and in the notables various 
<A NAME="256"></A>classes are included; of the common people, one class are husbandmen, another 
<A NAME="257"></A>artisans; another traders, who are employed in buying and selling; another 
<A NAME="258"></A>are the seafaring class, whether engaged in war or in trade, as ferrymen 
<A NAME="259"></A>or as fishermen. (In many places any one of these classes forms quite a 
<A NAME="260"></A>large population; for example, fishermen at Tarentum and Byzantium, crews 
<A NAME="261"></A>of triremes at Athens, merchant seamen at Aegina and Chios, ferrymen at 
<A NAME="262"></A>Tenedos.) To the classes already mentioned may be added day-laborers, and 
<A NAME="263"></A>those who, owing to their needy circumstances, have no leisure, or those 
<A NAME="264"></A>who are not of free birth on both sides; and there may be other classes 
<A NAME="265"></A>as well. The notables again may be divided according to their wealth, birth, 
<A NAME="266"></A>virtue, education, and similar differences.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>Of forms of democracy first comes that which is said to be based 
<A NAME="268"></A>strictly on equality. In such a democracy the law says that it is just 
<A NAME="269"></A>for the poor to have no more advantage than the rich; and that neither 
<A NAME="270"></A>should be masters, but both equal. For if liberty and equality, as is thought 
<A NAME="271"></A>by some, are chiefly to be found in democracy, they will be best attained 
<A NAME="272"></A>when all persons alike share in the government to the utmost. And since 
<A NAME="273"></A>the people are the majority, and the opinion of the majority is decisive, 
<A NAME="274"></A>such a government must necessarily be a democracy. Here then is one sort 
<A NAME="275"></A>of democracy. There is another, in which the magistrates are elected according 
<A NAME="276"></A>to a certain property qualification, but a low one; he who has the required 
<A NAME="277"></A>amount of property has a share in the government, but he who loses his 
<A NAME="278"></A>property loses his rights. Another kind is that in which all the citizens 
<A NAME="279"></A>who are under no disqualification share in the government, but still the 
<A NAME="280"></A>law is supreme. In another, everybody, if he be only a citizen, is admitted 
<A NAME="281"></A>to the government, but the law is supreme as before. A fifth form of democracy, 
<A NAME="282"></A>in other respects the same, is that in which, not the law, but the multitude, 
<A NAME="283"></A>have the supreme power, and supersede the law by their decrees. This is 
<A NAME="284"></A>a state of affairs brought about by the demagogues. For in democracies 
<A NAME="285"></A>which are subject to the law the best citizens hold the first place, and 
<A NAME="286"></A>there are no demagogues; but where the laws are not supreme, there demagogues 
<A NAME="287"></A>spring up. For the people becomes a monarch, and is many in one; and the 
<A NAME="288"></A>many have the power in their hands, not as individuals, but collectively. 
<A NAME="289"></A>Homer says that 'it is not good to have a rule of many,' but whether he 
<A NAME="290"></A>means this corporate rule, or the rule of many individuals, is uncertain. 
<A NAME="291"></A>At all events this sort of democracy, which is now a monarch, and no longer 
<A NAME="292"></A>under the control of law, seeks to exercise monarchical sway, and grows 
<A NAME="293"></A>into a despot; the flatterer is held in honor; this sort of democracy being 
<A NAME="294"></A>relatively to other democracies what tyranny is to other forms of monarchy. 
<A NAME="295"></A>The spirit of both is the same, and they alike exercise a despotic rule 
<A NAME="296"></A>over the better citizens. The decrees of the demos correspond to the edicts 
<A NAME="297"></A>of the tyrant; and the demagogue is to the one what the flatterer is to 
<A NAME="298"></A>the other. Both have great power; the flatterer with the tyrant, the demagogue 
<A NAME="299"></A>with democracies of the kind which we are describing. The demagogues make 
<A NAME="300"></A>the decrees of the people override the laws, by referring all things to 
<A NAME="301"></A>the popular assembly. And therefore they grow great, because the people 
<A NAME="302"></A>have an things in their hands, and they hold in their hands the votes of 
<A NAME="303"></A>the people, who are too ready to listen to them. Further, those who have 
<A NAME="304"></A>any complaint to bring against the magistrates say, 'Let the people be 
<A NAME="305"></A>judges'; the people are too happy to accept the invitation; and so the 
<A NAME="306"></A>authority of every office is undermined. Such a democracy is fairly open 
<A NAME="307"></A>to the objection that it is not a constitution at all; for where the laws 
<A NAME="308"></A>have no authority, there is no constitution. The law ought to be supreme 
<A NAME="309"></A>over all, and the magistracies should judge of particulars, and only this 
<A NAME="310"></A>should be considered a constitution. So that if democracy be a real form 
<A NAME="311"></A>of government, the sort of system in which all things are regulated by 
<A NAME="312"></A>decrees is clearly not even a democracy in the true sense of the word, 
<A NAME="313"></A>for decrees relate only to particulars.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>These then are the different kinds of democracy.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="315"></A><B>Part V</B>

<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>Of oligarchies, too, there are different kinds: one where the property 
<A NAME="317"></A>qualification for office is such that the poor, although they form the 
<A NAME="318"></A>majority, have no share in the government, yet he who acquires a qualification 
<A NAME="319"></A>may obtain a share. Another sort is when there is a qualification for office, 
<A NAME="320"></A>but a high one, and the vacancies in the governing body are fired by co-optation. 
<A NAME="321"></A>If the election is made out of all the qualified persons, a constitution 
<A NAME="322"></A>of this kind inclines to an aristocracy, if out of a privileged class, 
<A NAME="323"></A>to an oligarchy. Another sort of oligarchy is when the son succeeds the 
<A NAME="324"></A>father. There is a fourth form, likewise hereditary, in which the magistrates 
<A NAME="325"></A>are supreme and not the law. Among oligarchies this is what tyranny is 
<A NAME="326"></A>among monarchies, and the last-mentioned form of democracy among democracies; 
<A NAME="327"></A>and in fact this sort of oligarchy receives the name of a dynasty (or rule 
<A NAME="328"></A>of powerful families).
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>These are the different sorts of oligarchies and democracies. It 
<A NAME="330"></A>should, however, be remembered that in many states the constitution which 
<A NAME="331"></A>is established by law, although not democratic, owing to the education 
<A NAME="332"></A>and habits of the people may be administered democratically, and conversely 
<A NAME="333"></A>in other states the established constitution may incline to democracy, 
<A NAME="334"></A>but may be administered in an oligarchical spirit. This most often happens 
<A NAME="335"></A>after a revolution: for governments do not change at once; at first the 
<A NAME="336"></A>dominant party are content with encroaching a little upon their opponents. 
<A NAME="337"></A>The laws which existed previously continue in force, but the authors of 
<A NAME="338"></A>the revolution have the power in their hands.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="339"></A><B>Part VI</B>

<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>From what has been already said we may safely infer that there 
<A NAME="341"></A>are so many different kinds of democracies and of oligarchies. For it is 
<A NAME="342"></A>evident that either all the classes whom we mentioned must share in the 
<A NAME="343"></A>government, or some only and not others. When the class of husbandmen and 
<A NAME="344"></A>of those who possess moderate fortunes have the supreme power, the government 
<A NAME="345"></A>is administered according to law. For the citizens being compelled to live 
<A NAME="346"></A>by their labor have no leisure; and so they set up the authority of the 
<A NAME="347"></A>law, and attend assemblies only when necessary. They all obtain a share 
<A NAME="348"></A>in the government when they have acquired the qualification which is fixed 
<A NAME="349"></A>by the law- the absolute exclusion of any class would be a step towards 
<A NAME="350"></A>oligarchy; hence all who have acquired the property qualification are admitted 
<A NAME="351"></A>to a share in the constitution. But leisure cannot be provided for them 
<A NAME="352"></A>unless there are revenues to support them. This is one sort of democracy, 
<A NAME="353"></A>and these are the causes which give birth to it. Another kind is based 
<A NAME="354"></A>on the distinction which naturally comes next in order; in this, every 
<A NAME="355"></A>one to whose birth there is no objection is eligible, but actually shares 
<A NAME="356"></A>in the government only if he can find leisure. Hence in such a democracy 
<A NAME="357"></A>the supreme power is vested in the laws, because the state has no means 
<A NAME="358"></A>of paying the citizens. A third kind is when all freemen have a right to 
<A NAME="359"></A>share in the government, but do not actually share, for the reason which 
<A NAME="360"></A>has been already given; so that in this form again the law must rule. A 
<A NAME="361"></A>fourth kind of democracy is that which comes latest in the history of states. 
<A NAME="362"></A>In our own day, when cities have far outgrown their original size, and 
<A NAME="363"></A>their revenues have increased, all the citizens have a place in the government, 
<A NAME="364"></A>through the great preponderance of the multitude; and they all, including 
<A NAME="365"></A>the poor who receive pay, and therefore have leisure to exercise their 
<A NAME="366"></A>rights, share in the administration. Indeed, when they are paid, the common 
<A NAME="367"></A>people have the most leisure, for they are not hindered by the care of 
<A NAME="368"></A>their property, which often fetters the rich, who are thereby prevented 
<A NAME="369"></A>from taking part in the assembly or in the courts, and so the state is 
<A NAME="370"></A>governed by the poor, who are a majority, and not by the 
<A NAME="371"></A>laws.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>So many kinds of democracies there are, and they grow out of these 
<A NAME="373"></A>necessary causes.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>Of oligarchies, one form is that in which the majority of the citizens 
<A NAME="375"></A>have some property, but not very much; and this is the first form, which 
<A NAME="376"></A>allows to any one who obtains the required amount the right of sharing 
<A NAME="377"></A>in the government. The sharers in the government being a numerous body, 
<A NAME="378"></A>it follows that the law must govern, and not individuals. For in proportion 
<A NAME="379"></A>as they are further removed from a monarchical form of government, and 
<A NAME="380"></A>in respect of property have neither so much as to be able to live without 
<A NAME="381"></A>attending to business, nor so little as to need state support, they must 
<A NAME="382"></A>admit the rule of law and not claim to rule themselves. But if the men 
<A NAME="383"></A>of property in the state are fewer than in the former case, and own more 
<A NAME="384"></A>property, there arises a second form of oligarchy. For the stronger they 
<A NAME="385"></A>are, the more power they claim, and having this object in view, they themselves 
<A NAME="386"></A>select those of the other classes who are to be admitted to the government; 
<A NAME="387"></A>but, not being as yet strong enough to rule without the law, they make 
<A NAME="388"></A>the law represent their wishes. When this power is intensified by a further 
<A NAME="389"></A>diminution of their numbers and increase of their property, there arises 
<A NAME="390"></A>a third and further stage of oligarchy, in which the governing class keep 
<A NAME="391"></A>the offices in their own hands, and the law ordains that the son shall 
<A NAME="392"></A>succeed the father. When, again, the rulers have great wealth and numerous 
<A NAME="393"></A>friends, this sort of family despotism approaches a monarchy; individuals 
<A NAME="394"></A>rule and not the law. This is the fourth sort of oligarchy, and is analogous 
<A NAME="395"></A>to the last sort of democracy.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="396"></A><B>Part VII</B>

<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>There are still two forms besides democracy and oligarchy; one 
<A NAME="398"></A>of them is universally recognized and included among the four principal 
<A NAME="399"></A>forms of government, which are said to be (1) monarchy, (2) oligarchy, 
<A NAME="400"></A>(3) democracy, and (4) the so-called aristocracy or government of the best. 
<A NAME="401"></A>But there is also a fifth, which retains the generic name of polity or 
<A NAME="402"></A>constitutional government; this is not common, and therefore has not been 
<A NAME="403"></A>noticed by writers who attempt to enumerate the different kinds of government; 
<A NAME="404"></A>like Plato, in their books about the state, they recognize four only. The 
<A NAME="405"></A>term 'aristocracy' is rightly applied to the form of government which is 
<A NAME="406"></A>described in the first part of our treatise; for that only can be rightly 
<A NAME="407"></A>called aristocracy which is a government formed of the best men absolutely, 
<A NAME="408"></A>and not merely of men who are good when tried by any given standard. In 
<A NAME="409"></A>the perfect state the good man is absolutely the same as the good citizen; 
<A NAME="410"></A>whereas in other states the good citizen is only good relatively to his 
<A NAME="411"></A>own form of government. But there are some states differing from oligarchies 
<A NAME="412"></A>and also differing from the so-called polity or constitutional government; 
<A NAME="413"></A>these are termed aristocracies, and in them the magistrates are certainly 
<A NAME="414"></A>chosen, both according to their wealth and according to their merit. Such 
<A NAME="415"></A>a form of government differs from each of the two just now mentioned, and 
<A NAME="416"></A>is termed an aristocracy. For indeed in states which do not make virtue 
<A NAME="417"></A>the aim of the community, men of merit and reputation for virtue may be 
<A NAME="418"></A>found. And so where a government has regard to wealth, virtue, and numbers, 
<A NAME="419"></A>as at Carthage, that is aristocracy; and also where it has regard only 
<A NAME="420"></A>to two out of the three, as at Lacedaemon, to virtue and numbers, and the 
<A NAME="421"></A>two principles of democracy and virtue temper each other. There are these 
<A NAME="422"></A>two forms of aristocracy in addition to the first and perfect state, and 
<A NAME="423"></A>there is a third form, viz., the constitutions which incline more than 
<A NAME="424"></A>the so-called polity towards oligarchy.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="425"></A><B>Part VIII</B>

<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>I have yet to speak of the so-called polity and of tyranny. I put 
<A NAME="427"></A>them in this order, not because a polity or constitutional government is 
<A NAME="428"></A>to be regarded as a perversion any more than the above mentioned aristocracies. 
<A NAME="429"></A>The truth is, that they an fall short of the most perfect form of government, 
<A NAME="430"></A>and so they are reckoned among perversions, and the really perverted forms 
<A NAME="431"></A>are perversions of these, as I said in the original discussion. Last of 
<A NAME="432"></A>all I will speak of tyranny, which I place last in the series because I 
<A NAME="433"></A>am inquiring into the constitutions of states, and this is the very reverse 
<A NAME="434"></A>of a constitution
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>Having explained why I have adopted this order, I will proceed 
<A NAME="436"></A>to consider constitutional government; of which the nature will be clearer 
<A NAME="437"></A>now that oligarchy and democracy have been defined. For polity or constitutional 
<A NAME="438"></A>government may be described generally as a fusion of oligarchy and democracy; 
<A NAME="439"></A>but the term is usually applied to those forms of government which incline 
<A NAME="440"></A>towards democracy, and the term aristocracy to those which incline towards 
<A NAME="441"></A>oligarchy, because birth and education are commonly the accompaniments 
<A NAME="442"></A>of wealth. Moreover, the rich already possess the external advantages the 
<A NAME="443"></A>want of which is a temptation to crime, and hence they are called noblemen 
<A NAME="444"></A>and gentlemen. And inasmuch as aristocracy seeks to give predominance to 
<A NAME="445"></A>the best of the citizens, people say also of oligarchies that they are 
<A NAME="446"></A>composed of noblemen and gentlemen. Now it appears to be an impossible 
<A NAME="447"></A>thing that the state which is governed not by the best citizens but by 
<A NAME="448"></A>the worst should be well-governed, and equally impossible that the state 
<A NAME="449"></A>which is ill-governed should be governed by the best. But we must remember 
<A NAME="450"></A>that good laws, if they are not obeyed, do not constitute good government. 
<A NAME="451"></A>Hence there are two parts of good government; one is the actual obedience 
<A NAME="452"></A>of citizens to the laws, the other part is the goodness of the laws which 
<A NAME="453"></A>they obey; they may obey bad laws as well as good. And there may be a further 
<A NAME="454"></A>subdivision; they may obey either the best laws which are attainable to 
<A NAME="455"></A>them, or the best absolutely.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>The distribution of offices according to merit is a special characteristic 
<A NAME="457"></A>of aristocracy, for the principle of an aristocracy is virtue, as wealth 
<A NAME="458"></A>is of an oligarchy, and freedom of a democracy. In all of them there of 
<A NAME="459"></A>course exists the right of the majority, and whatever seems good to the 
<A NAME="460"></A>majority of those who share in the government has authority. Now in most 
<A NAME="461"></A>states the form called polity exists, for the fusion goes no further than 
<A NAME="462"></A>the attempt to unite the freedom of the poor and the wealth of the rich, 
<A NAME="463"></A>who commonly take the place of the noble. But as there are three grounds 
<A NAME="464"></A>on which men claim an equal share in the government, freedom, wealth, and 
<A NAME="465"></A>virtue (for the fourth or good birth is the result of the two last, being 
<A NAME="466"></A>only ancient wealth and virtue), it is clear that the admixture of the 
<A NAME="467"></A>two elements, that is to say, of the rich and poor, is to be called a polity 
<A NAME="468"></A>or constitutional government; and the union of the three is to be called 
<A NAME="469"></A>aristocracy or the government of the best, and more than any other form 
<A NAME="470"></A>of government, except the true and ideal, has a right to this 
<A NAME="471"></A>name.
<A NAME="472"></A><BR><BR>Thus far I have shown the existence of forms of states other than 
<A NAME="473"></A>monarchy, democracy, and oligarchy, and what they are, and in what aristocracies 
<A NAME="474"></A>differ from one another, and polities from aristocracies- that the two 
<A NAME="475"></A>latter are not very unlike is obvious.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="476"></A><B>Part IX</B>

<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR>Next we have to consider how by the side of oligarchy and democracy 
<A NAME="478"></A>the so-called polity or constitutional government springs up, and how it 
<A NAME="479"></A>should be organized. The nature of it will be at once understood from a 
<A NAME="480"></A>comparison of oligarchy and democracy; we must ascertain their different 
<A NAME="481"></A>characteristics, and taking a portion from each, put the two together, 
<A NAME="482"></A>like the parts of an indenture. Now there are three modes in which fusions 
<A NAME="483"></A>of government may be affected. In the first mode we must combine the laws 
<A NAME="484"></A>made by both governments, say concerning the administration of justice. 
<A NAME="485"></A>In oligarchies they impose a fine on the rich if they do not serve as judges, 
<A NAME="486"></A>and to the poor they give no pay; but in democracies they give pay to the 
<A NAME="487"></A>poor and do not fine the rich. Now (1) the union of these two modes is 
<A NAME="488"></A>a common or middle term between them, and is therefore characteristic of 
<A NAME="489"></A>a constitutional government, for it is a combination of both. This is one 
<A NAME="490"></A>mode of uniting the two elements. Or (2) a mean may be taken between the 
<A NAME="491"></A>enactments of the two: thus democracies require no property qualification, 
<A NAME="492"></A>or only a small one, from members of the assembly, oligarchies a high one; 
<A NAME="493"></A>here neither of these is the common term, but a mean between them. (3) 
<A NAME="494"></A>There is a third mode, in which something is borrowed from the oligarchical 
<A NAME="495"></A>and something from the democratical principle. For example, the appointment 
<A NAME="496"></A>of magistrates by lot is thought to be democratical, and the election of 
<A NAME="497"></A>them oligarchical; democratical again when there is no property qualification, 
<A NAME="498"></A>oligarchical when there is. In the aristocratical or constitutional state, 
<A NAME="499"></A>one element will be taken from each- from oligarchy the principle of electing 
<A NAME="500"></A>to offices, from democracy the disregard of qualification. Such are the 
<A NAME="501"></A>various modes of combination.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>There is a true union of oligarchy and democracy when the same 
<A NAME="503"></A>state may be termed either a democracy or an oligarchy; those who use both 
<A NAME="504"></A>names evidently feel that the fusion is complete. Such a fusion there is 
<A NAME="505"></A>also in the mean; for both extremes appear in it. The Lacedaemonian constitution, 
<A NAME="506"></A>for example, is often described as a democracy, because it has many democratical 
<A NAME="507"></A>features. In the first place the youth receive a democratical education. 
<A NAME="508"></A>For the sons of the poor are brought up with with the sons of the rich, 
<A NAME="509"></A>who are educated in such a manner as to make it possible for the sons of 
<A NAME="510"></A>the poor to be educated by them. A similar equality prevails in the following 
<A NAME="511"></A>period of life, and when the citizens are grown up to manhood the same 
<A NAME="512"></A>rule is observed; there is no distinction between the rich and poor. In 
<A NAME="513"></A>like manner they all have the same food at their public tables, and the 
<A NAME="514"></A>rich wear only such clothing as any poor man can afford. Again, the people 
<A NAME="515"></A>elect to one of the two greatest offices of state, and in the other they 
<A NAME="516"></A>share; for they elect the Senators and share in the Ephoralty. By others 
<A NAME="517"></A>the Spartan constitution is said to be an oligarchy, because it has many 
<A NAME="518"></A>oligarchical elements. That all offices are filled by election and none 
<A NAME="519"></A>by lot, is one of these oligarchical characteristics; that the power of 
<A NAME="520"></A>inflicting death or banishment rests with a few persons is another; and 
<A NAME="521"></A>there are others. In a well attempted polity there should appear to be 
<A NAME="522"></A>both elements and yet neither; also the government should rely on itself, 
<A NAME="523"></A>and not on foreign aid, and on itself not through the good will of a majority- 
<A NAME="524"></A>they might be equally well-disposed when there is a vicious form of government- 
<A NAME="525"></A>but through the general willingness of all classes in the state to maintain 
<A NAME="526"></A>the constitution.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>Enough of the manner in which a constitutional government, and 
<A NAME="528"></A>in which the so-called aristocracies ought to be framed.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="529"></A><B>Part X</B>

<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>Of the nature of tyranny I have still to speak, in order that it 
<A NAME="531"></A>may have its place in our inquiry (since even tyranny is reckoned by us 
<A NAME="532"></A>to be a form of government), although there is not much to be said about 
<A NAME="533"></A>it. I have already in the former part of this treatise discussed royalty 
<A NAME="534"></A>or kingship according to the most usual meaning of the term, and considered 
<A NAME="535"></A>whether it is or is not advantageous to states, and what kind of royalty 
<A NAME="536"></A>should be established, and from what source, and how.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>When speaking of royalty we also spoke of two forms of tyranny, 
<A NAME="538"></A>which are both according to law, and therefore easily pass into royalty. 
<A NAME="539"></A>Among barbarians there are elected monarchs who exercise a despotic power; 
<A NAME="540"></A>despotic rulers were also elected in ancient Hellas, called Aesymnetes 
<A NAME="541"></A>or Dictators. These monarchies, when compared with one another, exhibit 
<A NAME="542"></A>certain differences. And they are, as I said before, royal, in so far as 
<A NAME="543"></A>the monarch rules according to law over willing subjects; but they are 
<A NAME="544"></A>tyrannical in so far as he is despotic and rules according to his own fancy. 
<A NAME="545"></A>There is also a third kind of tyranny, which is the most typical form, 
<A NAME="546"></A>and is the counterpart of the perfect monarchy. This tyranny is just that 
<A NAME="547"></A>arbitrary power of an individual which is responsible to no one, and governs 
<A NAME="548"></A>all alike, whether equals or better, with a view to its own advantage, 
<A NAME="549"></A>not to that of its subjects, and therefore against their will. No freeman, 
<A NAME="550"></A>if he can escape from it, will endure such a government.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR>The kinds of tyranny are such and so many, and for the reasons 
<A NAME="552"></A>which I have given.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="553"></A><B>Part XI</B>

<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>We have now to inquire what is the best constitution for most states, 
<A NAME="555"></A>and the best life for most men, neither assuming a standard of virtue which 
<A NAME="556"></A>is above ordinary persons, nor an education which is exceptionally favored 
<A NAME="557"></A>by nature and circumstances, nor yet an ideal state which is an aspiration 
<A NAME="558"></A>only, but having regard to the life in which the majority are able to share, 
<A NAME="559"></A>and to the form of government which states in general can attain. As to 
<A NAME="560"></A>those aristocracies, as they are called, of which we were just now speaking, 
<A NAME="561"></A>they either lie beyond the possibilities of the greater number of states, 
<A NAME="562"></A>or they approximate to the so-called constitutional government, and therefore 
<A NAME="563"></A>need no separate discussion. And in fact the conclusion at which we arrive 
<A NAME="564"></A>respecting all these forms rests upon the same grounds. For if what was 
<A NAME="565"></A>said in the Ethics is true, that the happy life is the life according to 
<A NAME="566"></A>virtue lived without impediment, and that virtue is a mean, then the life 
<A NAME="567"></A>which is in a mean, and in a mean attainable by every one, must be the 
<A NAME="568"></A>best. And the same the same principles of virtue and vice are characteristic 
<A NAME="569"></A>of cities and of constitutions; for the constitution is in a figure the 
<A NAME="570"></A>life of the city.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR>Now in all states there are three elements: one class is very rich, 
<A NAME="572"></A>another very poor, and a third in a mean. It is admitted that moderation 
<A NAME="573"></A>and the mean are best, and therefore it will clearly be best to possess 
<A NAME="574"></A>the gifts of fortune in moderation; for in that condition of life men are 
<A NAME="575"></A>most ready to follow rational principle. But he who greatly excels in beauty, 
<A NAME="576"></A>strength, birth, or wealth, or on the other hand who is very poor, or very 
<A NAME="577"></A>weak, or very much disgraced, finds it difficult to follow rational principle. 
<A NAME="578"></A>Of these two the one sort grow into violent and great criminals, the others 
<A NAME="579"></A>into rogues and petty rascals. And two sorts of offenses correspond to 
<A NAME="580"></A>them, the one committed from violence, the other from roguery. Again, the 
<A NAME="581"></A>middle class is least likely to shrink from rule, or to be over-ambitious 
<A NAME="582"></A>for it; both of which are injuries to the state. Again, those who have 
<A NAME="583"></A>too much of the goods of fortune, strength, wealth, friends, and the like, 
<A NAME="584"></A>are neither willing nor able to submit to authority. The evil begins at 
<A NAME="585"></A>home; for when they are boys, by reason of the luxury in which they are 
<A NAME="586"></A>brought up, they never learn, even at school, the habit of obedience. On 
<A NAME="587"></A>the other hand, the very poor, who are in the opposite extreme, are too 
<A NAME="588"></A>degraded. So that the one class cannot obey, and can only rule despotically; 
<A NAME="589"></A>the other knows not how to command and must be ruled like slaves. Thus 
<A NAME="590"></A>arises a city, not of freemen, but of masters and slaves, the one despising, 
<A NAME="591"></A>the other envying; and nothing can be more fatal to friendship and good 
<A NAME="592"></A>fellowship in states than this: for good fellowship springs from friendship; 
<A NAME="593"></A>when men are at enmity with one another, they would rather not even share 
<A NAME="594"></A>the same path. But a city ought to be composed, as far as possible, of 
<A NAME="595"></A>equals and similars; and these are generally the middle classes. Wherefore 
<A NAME="596"></A>the city which is composed of middle-class citizens is necessarily best 
<A NAME="597"></A>constituted in respect of the elements of which we say the fabric of the 
<A NAME="598"></A>state naturally consists. And this is the class of citizens which is most 
<A NAME="599"></A>secure in a state, for they do not, like the poor, covet their neighbors' 
<A NAME="600"></A>goods; nor do others covet theirs, as the poor covet the goods of the rich; 
<A NAME="601"></A>and as they neither plot against others, nor are themselves plotted against, 
<A NAME="602"></A>they pass through life safely. Wisely then did Phocylides pray- 'Many things 
<A NAME="603"></A>are best in the mean; I desire to be of a middle condition in my 
<A NAME="604"></A>city.'
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>Thus it is manifest that the best political community is formed 
<A NAME="606"></A>by citizens of the middle class, and that those states are likely to be 
<A NAME="607"></A>well-administered in which the middle class is large, and stronger if possible 
<A NAME="608"></A>than both the other classes, or at any rate than either singly; for the 
<A NAME="609"></A>addition of the middle class turns the scale, and prevents either of the 
<A NAME="610"></A>extremes from being dominant. Great then is the good fortune of a state 
<A NAME="611"></A>in which the citizens have a moderate and sufficient property; for where 
<A NAME="612"></A>some possess much, and the others nothing, there may arise an extreme democracy, 
<A NAME="613"></A>or a pure oligarchy; or a tyranny may grow out of either extreme- either 
<A NAME="614"></A>out of the most rampant democracy, or out of an oligarchy; but it is not 
<A NAME="615"></A>so likely to arise out of the middle constitutions and those akin to them. 
<A NAME="616"></A>I will explain the reason of this hereafter, when I speak of the revolutions 
<A NAME="617"></A>of states. The mean condition of states is clearly best, for no other is 
<A NAME="618"></A>free from faction; and where the middle class is large, there are least 
<A NAME="619"></A>likely to be factions and dissensions. For a similar reason large states 
<A NAME="620"></A>are less liable to faction than small ones, because in them the middle 
<A NAME="621"></A>class is large; whereas in small states it is easy to divide all the citizens 
<A NAME="622"></A>into two classes who are either rich or poor, and to leave nothing in the 
<A NAME="623"></A>middle. And democracies are safer and more permanent than oligarchies, 
<A NAME="624"></A>because they have a middle class which is more numerous and has a greater 
<A NAME="625"></A>share in the government; for when there is no middle class, and the poor 
<A NAME="626"></A>greatly exceed in number, troubles arise, and the state soon comes to an 
<A NAME="627"></A>end. A proof of the superiority of the middle dass is that the best legislators 
<A NAME="628"></A>have been of a middle condition; for example, Solon, as his own verses 
<A NAME="629"></A>testify; and Lycurgus, for he was not a king; and Charondas, and almost 
<A NAME="630"></A>all legislators.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>These considerations will help us to understand why most governments 
<A NAME="632"></A>are either democratical or oligarchical. The reason is that the middle 
<A NAME="633"></A>class is seldom numerous in them, and whichever party, whether the rich 
<A NAME="634"></A>or the common people, transgresses the mean and predominates, draws the 
<A NAME="635"></A>constitution its own way, and thus arises either oligarchy or democracy. 
<A NAME="636"></A>There is another reason- the poor and the rich quarrel with one another, 
<A NAME="637"></A>and whichever side gets the better, instead of establishing a just or popular 
<A NAME="638"></A>government, regards political supremacy as the prize of victory, and the 
<A NAME="639"></A>one party sets up a democracy and the other an oligarchy. Further, both 
<A NAME="640"></A>the parties which had the supremacy in Hellas looked only to the interest 
<A NAME="641"></A>of their own form of government, and established in states, the one, democracies, 
<A NAME="642"></A>and the other, oligarchies; they thought of their own advantage, of the 
<A NAME="643"></A>public not at all. For these reasons the middle form of government has 
<A NAME="644"></A>rarely, if ever, existed, and among a very few only. One man alone of all 
<A NAME="645"></A>who ever ruled in Hellas was induced to give this middle constitution to 
<A NAME="646"></A>states. But it has now become a habit among the citizens of states, not 
<A NAME="647"></A>even to care about equality; all men are seeking for dominion, or, if conquered, 
<A NAME="648"></A>are willing to submit.
<A NAME="649"></A><BR><BR>What then is the best form of government, and what makes it the 
<A NAME="650"></A>best, is evident; and of other constitutions, since we say that there are 
<A NAME="651"></A>many kinds of democracy and many of oligarchy, it is not difficult to see 
<A NAME="652"></A>which has the first and which the second or any other place in the order 
<A NAME="653"></A>of excellence, now that we have determined which is the best. For that 
<A NAME="654"></A>which is nearest to the best must of necessity be better, and that which 
<A NAME="655"></A>is furthest from it worse, if we are judging absolutely and not relatively 
<A NAME="656"></A>to given conditions: I say 'relatively to given conditions,' since a particular 
<A NAME="657"></A>government may be preferable, but another form may be better for some 
<A NAME="658"></A>people.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="659"></A><B>Part XII</B>

<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR>We have now to consider what and what kind of government is suitable 
<A NAME="661"></A>to what and what kind of men. I may begin by assuming, as a general principle 
<A NAME="662"></A>common to all governments, that the portion of the state which desires 
<A NAME="663"></A>the permanence of the constitution ought to be stronger than that which 
<A NAME="664"></A>desires the reverse. Now every city is composed of quality and quantity. 
<A NAME="665"></A>By quality I mean freedom, wealth, education, good birth, and by quantity, 
<A NAME="666"></A>superiority of numbers. Quality may exist in one of the classes which make 
<A NAME="667"></A>up the state, and quantity in the other. For example, the meanly-born may 
<A NAME="668"></A>be more in number than the well-born, or the poor than the rich, yet they 
<A NAME="669"></A>may not so much exceed in quantity as they fall short in quality; and therefore 
<A NAME="670"></A>there must be a comparison of quantity and quality. Where the number of 
<A NAME="671"></A>the poor is more than proportioned to the wealth of the rich, there will 
<A NAME="672"></A>naturally be a democracy, varying in form with the sort of people who compose 
<A NAME="673"></A>it in each case. If, for example, the husbandmen exceed in number, the 
<A NAME="674"></A>first form of democracy will then arise; if the artisans and laboring class, 
<A NAME="675"></A>the last; and so with the intermediate forms. But where the rich and the 
<A NAME="676"></A>notables exceed in quality more than they fall short in quantity, there 
<A NAME="677"></A>oligarchy arises, similarly assuming various forms according to the kind 
<A NAME="678"></A>of superiority possessed by the oligarchs.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>The legislator should always include the middle class in his government; 
<A NAME="680"></A>if he makes his laws oligarchical, to the middle class let him look; if 
<A NAME="681"></A>he makes them democratical, he should equally by his laws try to attach 
<A NAME="682"></A>this class to the state. There only can the government ever be stable where 
<A NAME="683"></A>the middle class exceeds one or both of the others, and in that case there 
<A NAME="684"></A>will be no fear that the rich will unite with the poor against the rulers. 
<A NAME="685"></A>For neither of them will ever be willing to serve the other, and if they 
<A NAME="686"></A>look for some form of government more suitable to both, they will find 
<A NAME="687"></A>none better than this, for the rich and the poor will never consent to 
<A NAME="688"></A>rule in turn, because they mistrust one another. The arbiter is always 
<A NAME="689"></A>the one trusted, and he who is in the middle is an arbiter. The more perfect 
<A NAME="690"></A>the admixture of the political elements, the more lasting will be the constitution. 
<A NAME="691"></A>Many even of those who desire to form aristocratical governments make a 
<A NAME="692"></A>mistake, not only in giving too much power to the rich, but in attempting 
<A NAME="693"></A>to overreach the people. There comes a time when out of a false good there 
<A NAME="694"></A>arises a true evil, since the encroachments of the rich are more destructive 
<A NAME="695"></A>to the constitution than those of the people.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="696"></A><B>Part XIII</B>

<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR>The devices by which oligarchies deceive the people are five in 
<A NAME="698"></A>number; they relate to (1) the assembly; (2) the magistracies; (3) the 
<A NAME="699"></A>courts of law; (4) the use of arms; (5) gymnastic exercises. (1) The assemblies 
<A NAME="700"></A>are thrown open to all, but either the rich only are fined for non-attendance, 
<A NAME="701"></A>or a much larger fine is inflicted upon them. (2) to the magistracies, 
<A NAME="702"></A>those who are qualified by property cannot decline office upon oath, but 
<A NAME="703"></A>the poor may. (3) In the law courts the rich, and the rich only, are fined 
<A NAME="704"></A>if they do not serve, the poor are let off with impunity, or, as in the 
<A NAME="705"></A>laws of Charondas, a larger fine is inflicted on the rich, and a smaller 
<A NAME="706"></A>one on the poor. In some states all citizen who have registered themselves 
<A NAME="707"></A>are allowed to attend the assembly and to try causes; but if after registration 
<A NAME="708"></A>they do not attend either in the assembly or at the courts, heavy fines 
<A NAME="709"></A>are imposed upon them. The intention is that through fear of the fines 
<A NAME="710"></A>they may avoid registering themselves, and then they cannot sit in the 
<A NAME="711"></A>law-courts or in the assembly. concerning (4) the possession of arms, and 
<A NAME="712"></A>(5) gymnastic exercises, they legislate in a similar spirit. For the poor 
<A NAME="713"></A>are not obliged to have arms, but the rich are fined for not having them; 
<A NAME="714"></A>and in like manner no penalty is inflicted on the poor for non-attendance 
<A NAME="715"></A>at the gymnasium, and consequently, having nothing to fear, they do not 
<A NAME="716"></A>attend, whereas the rich are liable to a fine, and therefore they take 
<A NAME="717"></A>care to attend.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR><BR>These are the devices of oligarchical legislators, and in democracies 
<A NAME="719"></A>they have counter devices. They pay the poor for attending the assemblies 
<A NAME="720"></A>and the law-courts, and they inflict no penalty on the rich for non-attendance. 
<A NAME="721"></A>It is obvious that he who would duly mix the two principles should combine 
<A NAME="722"></A>the practice of both, and provide that the poor should be paid to attend, 
<A NAME="723"></A>and the rich fined if they do not attend, for then all will take part; 
<A NAME="724"></A>if there is no such combination, power will be in the hands of one party 
<A NAME="725"></A>only. The government should be confined to those who carry arms. As to 
<A NAME="726"></A>the property qualification, no absolute rule can be laid down, but we must 
<A NAME="727"></A>see what is the highest qualification sufficiently comprehensive to secure 
<A NAME="728"></A>that the number of those who have the rights of citizens exceeds the number 
<A NAME="729"></A>of those excluded. Even if they have no share in office, the poor, provided 
<A NAME="730"></A>only that they are not outraged or deprived of their property, will be 
<A NAME="731"></A>quiet enough.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR><BR>But to secure gentle treatment for the poor is not an easy thing, 
<A NAME="733"></A>since a ruling class is not always humane. And in time of war the poor 
<A NAME="734"></A>are apt to hesitate unless they are fed; when fed, they are willing enough 
<A NAME="735"></A>to fight. In some states the government is vested, not only in those who 
<A NAME="736"></A>are actually serving, but also in those who have served; among the Malians, 
<A NAME="737"></A>for example, the governing body consisted of the latter, while the magistrates 
<A NAME="738"></A>were chosen from those actually on service. And the earliest government 
<A NAME="739"></A>which existed among the Hellenes, after the overthrow of the kingly power, 
<A NAME="740"></A>grew up out of the warrior class, and was originally taken from the knights 
<A NAME="741"></A>(for strength and superiority in war at that time depended on cavalry; 
<A NAME="742"></A>indeed, without discipline, infantry are useless, and in ancient times 
<A NAME="743"></A>there was no military knowledge or tactics, and therefore the strength 
<A NAME="744"></A>of armies lay in their cavalry). But when cities increased and the heavy 
<A NAME="745"></A>armed grew in strength, more had a share in the government; and this is 
<A NAME="746"></A>the reason why the states which we call constitutional governments have 
<A NAME="747"></A>been hitherto called democracies. Ancient constitutions, as might be expected, 
<A NAME="748"></A>were oligarchical and royal; their population being small they had no considerable 
<A NAME="749"></A>middle class; the people were weak in numbers and organization, and were 
<A NAME="750"></A>therefore more contented to be governed.
<A NAME="751"></A><BR><BR>I have explained why there are various forms of government, and 
<A NAME="752"></A>why there are more than is generally supposed; for democracy, as well as 
<A NAME="753"></A>other constitutions, has more than one form: also what their differences 
<A NAME="754"></A>are, and whence they arise, and what is the best form of government, speaking 
<A NAME="755"></A>generally and to whom the various forms of government are best suited; 
<A NAME="756"></A>all this has now been explained.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="757"></A><B>Part XIV</B>

<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR>Having thus gained an appropriate basis of discussion, we will 
<A NAME="759"></A>proceed to speak of the points which follow next in order. We will consider 
<A NAME="760"></A>the subject not only in general but with reference to particular constitutions. 
<A NAME="761"></A>All constitutions have three elements, concerning which the good lawgiver 
<A NAME="762"></A>has to regard what is expedient for each constitution. When they are well-ordered, 
<A NAME="763"></A>the constitution is well-ordered, and as they differ from one another, 
<A NAME="764"></A>constitutions differ. There is (1) one element which deliberates about 
<A NAME="765"></A>public affairs; secondly (2) that concerned with the magistrates- the question 
<A NAME="766"></A>being, what they should be, over what they should exercise authority, and 
<A NAME="767"></A>what should be the mode of electing to them; and thirdly (3) that which 
<A NAME="768"></A>has judicial power.
<A NAME="769"></A><BR><BR>The deliberative element has authority in matters of war and peace, 
<A NAME="770"></A>in making and unmaking alliances; it passes laws, inflicts death, exile, 
<A NAME="771"></A>confiscation, elects magistrates and audits their accounts. These powers 
<A NAME="772"></A>must be assigned either all to all the citizens or an to some of them (for 
<A NAME="773"></A>example, to one or more magistracies, or different causes to different 
<A NAME="774"></A>magistracies), or some of them to all, and others of them only to some. 
<A NAME="775"></A>That all things should be decided by all is characteristic of democracy; 
<A NAME="776"></A>this is the sort of equality which the people desire. But there are various 
<A NAME="777"></A>ways in which all may share in the government; they may deliberate, not 
<A NAME="778"></A>all in one body, but by turns, as in the constitution of Telecles the Milesian. 
<A NAME="779"></A>There are other constitutions in which the boards of magistrates meet and 
<A NAME="780"></A>deliberate, but come into office by turns, and are elected out of the tribes 
<A NAME="781"></A>and the very smallest divisions of the state, until every one has obtained 
<A NAME="782"></A>office in his turn. The citizens, on the other hand, are assembled only 
<A NAME="783"></A>for the purposes of legislation, and to consult about the constitution, 
<A NAME="784"></A>and to hear the edicts of the magistrates. In another variety of democracy 
<A NAME="785"></A>the citizen form one assembly, but meet only to elect magistrates, to pass 
<A NAME="786"></A>laws, to advise about war and peace, and to make scrutinies. Other matters 
<A NAME="787"></A>are referred severally to special magistrates, who are elected by vote 
<A NAME="788"></A>or by lot out of all the citizens Or again, the citizens meet about election 
<A NAME="789"></A>to offices and about scrutinies, and deliberate concerning war or alliances 
<A NAME="790"></A>while other matters are administered by the magistrates, who, as far as 
<A NAME="791"></A>is possible, are elected by vote. I am speaking of those magistracies in 
<A NAME="792"></A>which special knowledge is required. A fourth form of democracy is when 
<A NAME="793"></A>all the citizens meet to deliberate about everything, and the magistrates 
<A NAME="794"></A>decide nothing, but only make the preliminary inquiries; and that is the 
<A NAME="795"></A>way in which the last and worst form of democracy, corresponding, as we 
<A NAME="796"></A>maintain, to the close family oligarchy and to tyranny, is at present administered. 
<A NAME="797"></A>All these modes are democratical.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR>On the other hand, that some should deliberate about all is oligarchical. 
<A NAME="799"></A>This again is a mode which, like the democratical has many forms. When 
<A NAME="800"></A>the deliberative class being elected out of those who have a moderate qualification 
<A NAME="801"></A>are numerous and they respect and obey the prohibitions of the law without 
<A NAME="802"></A>altering it, and any one who has the required qualification shares in the 
<A NAME="803"></A>government, then, just because of this moderation, the oligarchy inclines 
<A NAME="804"></A>towards polity. But when only selected individuals and not the whole people 
<A NAME="805"></A>share in the deliberations of the state, then, although, as in the former 
<A NAME="806"></A>case, they observe the law, the government is a pure oligarchy. Or, again, 
<A NAME="807"></A>when those who have the power of deliberation are self-elected, and son 
<A NAME="808"></A>succeeds father, and they and not the laws are supreme- the government 
<A NAME="809"></A>is of necessity oligarchical. Where, again, particular persons have authority 
<A NAME="810"></A>in particular matters- for example, when the whole people decide about 
<A NAME="811"></A>peace and war and hold scrutinies, but the magistrates regulate everything 
<A NAME="812"></A>else, and they are elected by vote- there the government is an aristocracy. 
<A NAME="813"></A>And if some questions are decided by magistrates elected by vote, and others 
<A NAME="814"></A>by magistrates elected by lot, either absolutely or out of select candidates, 
<A NAME="815"></A>or elected partly by vote, partly by lot- these practices are partly characteristic 
<A NAME="816"></A>of an aristocratical government, and party of a pure constitutional 
<A NAME="817"></A>government.
<A NAME="818"></A><BR><BR>These are the various forms of the deliberative body; they correspond 
<A NAME="819"></A>to the various forms of government. And the government of each state is 
<A NAME="820"></A>administered according to one or other of the principles which have been 
<A NAME="821"></A>laid down. Now it is for the interest of democracy, according to the most 
<A NAME="822"></A>prevalent notion of it (I am speaking of that extreme form of democracy 
<A NAME="823"></A>in which the people are supreme even over the laws), with a view to better 
<A NAME="824"></A>deliberation to adopt the custom of oligarchies respecting courts of law. 
<A NAME="825"></A>For in oligarchies the rich who are wanted to be judges are compelled to 
<A NAME="826"></A>attend under pain of a fine, whereas in deinocracies the poor are paid 
<A NAME="827"></A>to attend. And this practice of oligarchies should be adopted by democracies 
<A NAME="828"></A>in their public assemblies, for they will advise better if they all deliberate 
<A NAME="829"></A>together- the people with the notables and the notables with the people. 
<A NAME="830"></A>It is also a good plan that those who deliberate should be elected by vote 
<A NAME="831"></A>or by lot in equal numbers out of the different classes; and that if the 
<A NAME="832"></A>people greatly exceed in number those who have political training, pay 
<A NAME="833"></A>should not be given to all, but only to as many as would balance the number 
<A NAME="834"></A>of the notables, or that the number in excess should be eliminated by lot. 
<A NAME="835"></A>But in oligarchies either certain persons should be co-opted from the mass, 
<A NAME="836"></A>or a class of officers should be appointed such as exist in some states 
<A NAME="837"></A>who are termed probuli and guardians of the law; and the citizens should 
<A NAME="838"></A>occupy themselves exclusively with matters on which these have previously 
<A NAME="839"></A>deliberated; for so the people will have a share in the deliberations of 
<A NAME="840"></A>the state, but will not be able to disturb the principles of the constitution. 
<A NAME="841"></A>Again, in oligarchies either the people ought to accept the measures of 
<A NAME="842"></A>the government, or not to pass anything contrary to them; or, if all are 
<A NAME="843"></A>allowed to share in counsel, the decision should rest with the magistrates. 
<A NAME="844"></A>The opposite of what is done in constitutional governments should be the 
<A NAME="845"></A>rule in oligarchies; the veto of the majority should be final, their assent 
<A NAME="846"></A>not final, but the proposal should be referred back to the magistrates. 
<A NAME="847"></A>Whereas in constitutional governments they take the contrary course; the 
<A NAME="848"></A>few have the negative, not the affirmative power; the affirmation of everything 
<A NAME="849"></A>rests with the multitude.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR><BR>These, then, are our conclusions respecting the deliberative, that 
<A NAME="851"></A>is, the supreme element in states.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="852"></A><B>Part XV</B>

<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR>Next we will proceed to consider the distribution of offices; this 
<A NAME="854"></A>too, being a part of politics concerning which many questions arise: What 
<A NAME="855"></A>shall their number be? Over what shall they preside, and what shall be 
<A NAME="856"></A>their duration? Sometimes they last for six months, sometimes for less; 
<A NAME="857"></A>sometimes they are annual, while in other cases offices are held for still 
<A NAME="858"></A>longer periods. Shall they be for life or for a long term of years; or, 
<A NAME="859"></A>if for a short term only, shall the same persons hold them over and over 
<A NAME="860"></A>again, or once only? Also about the appointment to them- from whom are 
<A NAME="861"></A>they to be chosen, by whom, and how? We should first be in a position to 
<A NAME="862"></A>say what are the possible varieties of them, and then we may proceed to 
<A NAME="863"></A>determine which are suited to different forms of government. But what are 
<A NAME="864"></A>to be included under the term 'offices'? That is a question not quite so 
<A NAME="865"></A>easily answered. For a political community requires many officers; and 
<A NAME="866"></A>not every one who is chosen by vote or by lot is to be regarded as a ruler. 
<A NAME="867"></A>In the first place there are the priests, who must be distinguished from 
<A NAME="868"></A>political officers; masters of choruses and heralds, even ambassadors, 
<A NAME="869"></A>are elected by vote. Some duties of superintendence again are political, 
<A NAME="870"></A>extending either to all the citizens in a single sphere of action, like 
<A NAME="871"></A>the office of the general who superintends them when they are in the field, 
<A NAME="872"></A>or to a section of them only, like the inspectorships of women or of youth. 
<A NAME="873"></A>Other offices are concerned with household management, like that of the 
<A NAME="874"></A>corn measurers who exist in many states and are elected officers. There 
<A NAME="875"></A>are also menial offices which the rich have executed by their slaves. Speaking 
<A NAME="876"></A>generally, those are to be called offices to which the duties are assigned 
<A NAME="877"></A>of deliberating about certain measures and ofjudging and commanding, especially 
<A NAME="878"></A>the last; for to command is the especial duty of a magistrate. But the 
<A NAME="879"></A>question is not of any importance in practice; no one has ever brought 
<A NAME="880"></A>into court the meaning of the word, although such problems have a speculative 
<A NAME="881"></A>interest.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR><BR>What kinds of offices, and how many, are necessary to the existence 
<A NAME="883"></A>of a state, and which, if not necessary, yet conduce to its well being 
<A NAME="884"></A>are much more important considerations, affecting all constitutions, but 
<A NAME="885"></A>more especially small states. For in great states it is possible, and indeed 
<A NAME="886"></A>necessary, that every office should have a special function; where the 
<A NAME="887"></A>citizens are numerous, many may hold office. And so it happens that some 
<A NAME="888"></A>offices a man holds a second time only after a long interval, and others 
<A NAME="889"></A>he holds once only; and certainly every work is better done which receives 
<A NAME="890"></A>the sole, and not the divided attention of the worker. But in small states 
<A NAME="891"></A>it is necessary to combine many offices in a few hands, since the small 
<A NAME="892"></A>number of citizens does not admit of many holding office: for who will 
<A NAME="893"></A>there be to succeed them? And yet small states at times require the same 
<A NAME="894"></A>offices and laws as large ones; the difference is that the one want them 
<A NAME="895"></A>often, the others only after long intervals. Hence there is no reason why 
<A NAME="896"></A>the care of many offices should not be imposed on the same person, for 
<A NAME="897"></A>they will not interfere with each other. When the population is small, 
<A NAME="898"></A>offices should be like the spits which also serve to hold a lamp. We must 
<A NAME="899"></A>first ascertain how many magistrates are necessary in every state, and 
<A NAME="900"></A>also how many are not exactly necessary, but are nevertheless useful, and 
<A NAME="901"></A>then there will be no difficulty in seeing what offices can be combined 
<A NAME="902"></A>in one. We should also know over which matters several local tribunals 
<A NAME="903"></A>are to have jurisdiction, and in which authority should be centralized: 
<A NAME="904"></A>for example, should one person keep order in the market and another in 
<A NAME="905"></A>some other place, or should the same person be responsible everywhere? 
<A NAME="906"></A>Again, should offices be divided according to the subjects with which they 
<A NAME="907"></A>deal, or according to the persons with whom they deal: I mean to say, should 
<A NAME="908"></A>one person see to good order in general, or one look after the boys, another 
<A NAME="909"></A>after the women, and so on? Further, under different constitutions, should 
<A NAME="910"></A>the magistrates be the same or different? For example, in democracy, oligarchy, 
<A NAME="911"></A>aristocracy, monarchy, should there be the same magistrates, although they 
<A NAME="912"></A>are elected, not out of equal or similar classes of citizen but differently 
<A NAME="913"></A>under different constitutions- in aristocracies, for example, they are 
<A NAME="914"></A>chosen from the educated, in oligarchies from the wealthy, and in democracies 
<A NAME="915"></A>from the free- or are there certain differences in the offices answering 
<A NAME="916"></A>to them as well, and may the same be suitable to some, but different offices 
<A NAME="917"></A>to others? For in some states it may be convenient that the same office 
<A NAME="918"></A>should have a more extensive, in other states a narrower sphere. Special 
<A NAME="919"></A>offices are peculiar to certain forms of government: for example that of 
<A NAME="920"></A>probuli, which is not a democratic office, although a bule or council is. 
<A NAME="921"></A>There must be some body of men whose duty is to prepare measures for the 
<A NAME="922"></A>people in order that they may not be diverted from their business; when 
<A NAME="923"></A>these are few in number, the state inclines to an oligarchy: or rather 
<A NAME="924"></A>the probuli must always be few, and are therefore an oligarchical element. 
<A NAME="925"></A>But when both institutions exist in a state, the probuli are a check on 
<A NAME="926"></A>the council; for the counselors is a democratic element, but the probuli 
<A NAME="927"></A>are oligarchical. Even the power of the council disappears when democracy 
<A NAME="928"></A>has taken that extreme form in which the people themselves are always meeting 
<A NAME="929"></A>and deliberating about everything. This is the case when the members of 
<A NAME="930"></A>the assembly receive abundant pay; for they have nothing to do and are 
<A NAME="931"></A>always holding assemblies and deciding everything for themselves. A magistracy 
<A NAME="932"></A>which controls the boys or the women, or any similar office, is suited 
<A NAME="933"></A>to an aristocracy rather than to a democracy; for how can the magistrates 
<A NAME="934"></A>prevent the wives of the poor from going out of doors? Neither is it an 
<A NAME="935"></A>oligarchical office; for the wives of the oligarchs are too fine to be 
<A NAME="936"></A>controlled.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR>Enough of these matters. I will now inquire into appointments to 
<A NAME="938"></A>offices. The varieties depend on three terms, and the combinations of these 
<A NAME="939"></A>give all possible modes: first, who appoints? secondly, from whom? and 
<A NAME="940"></A>thirdly, how? Each of these three admits of three varieties: (A) All the 
<A NAME="941"></A>citizens, or (B) only some, appoint. Either (1) the magistrates are chosen 
<A NAME="942"></A>out of all or (2) out of some who are distinguished either by a property 
<A NAME="943"></A>qualification, or by birth, or merit, or for some special reason, as at 
<A NAME="944"></A>Megara only those were eligible who had returned from exile and fought 
<A NAME="945"></A>together against the democracy. They may be appointed either (a) by vote 
<A NAME="946"></A>or (b) by lot. Again, these several varieties may be coupled, I mean that 
<A NAME="947"></A>(C) some officers may be elected by some, others by all, and (3) some again 
<A NAME="948"></A>out of some, and others out of all, and (c) some by vote and others by 
<A NAME="949"></A>lot. Each variety of these terms admits of four modes.
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><BR>For either (A 1 a) all may appoint from all by vote, or (A 1 b) 
<A NAME="951"></A>all from all by lot, or (A 2 a) all from some by vote, or (A 2 b) all from 
<A NAME="952"></A>some by lot (and from all, either by sections, as, for example, by tribes, 
<A NAME="953"></A>and wards, and phratries, until all the citizens have been gone through; 
<A NAME="954"></A>or the citizens may be in all cases eligible indiscriminately); or again 
<A NAME="955"></A>(A 1 c, A 2 c) to some offices in the one way, to some in the other. Again, 
<A NAME="956"></A>if it is only some that appoint, they may do so either (B 1 a) from all 
<A NAME="957"></A>by vote, or (B 1 b) from all by lot, or (B 2 a) from some by vote, or (B 
<A NAME="958"></A>2 b) from some by lot, or to some offices in the one way, to others in 
<A NAME="959"></A>the other, i.e., (B 1 c) from all, to some offices by vote, to some by 
<A NAME="960"></A>lot, and (B 2 C) from some, to some offices by vote, to some by lot. Thus 
<A NAME="961"></A>the modes that arise, apart from two (C, 3) out of the three couplings, 
<A NAME="962"></A>number twelve. Of these systems two are popular, that all should appoint 
<A NAME="963"></A>from all (A 1 a) by vote or (A 1 b) by lot- or (A 1 c) by both. That all 
<A NAME="964"></A>should not appoint at once, but should appoint from all or from some either 
<A NAME="965"></A>by lot or by vote or by both, or appoint to some offices from all and to 
<A NAME="966"></A>others from some ('by both' meaning to some offices by lot, to others by 
<A NAME="967"></A>vote), is characteristic of a polity. And (B 1 c) that some should appoint 
<A NAME="968"></A>from all, to some offices by vote, to others by lot, is also characteristic 
<A NAME="969"></A>of a polity, but more oligarchical than the former method. And (A 3 a, 
<A NAME="970"></A>b, c, B 3 a, b, c) to appoint from both, to some offices from all, to others 
<A NAME="971"></A>from some, is characteristic of a polity with a leaning towards aristocracy. 
<A NAME="972"></A>That (B 2) some should appoint from some is oligarchical- even (B 2 b) 
<A NAME="973"></A>that some should appoint from some by lot (and if this does not actually 
<A NAME="974"></A>occur, it is none the less oligarchical in character), or (B 2 C) that 
<A NAME="975"></A>some should appoint from some by both. (B 1 a) that some should appoint 
<A NAME="976"></A>from all, and (A 2 a) that all should appoint from some, by vote, is 
<A NAME="977"></A>aristocratic.
<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR>These are the different modes of constituting magistrates, and 
<A NAME="979"></A>these correspond to different forms of government: which are proper to 
<A NAME="980"></A>which, or how they ought to be established, will be evident when we determine 
<A NAME="981"></A>the nature of their powers. By powers I mean such powers as a magistrate 
<A NAME="982"></A>exercises over the revenue or in defense of the country; for there are 
<A NAME="983"></A>various kinds of power: the power of the general, for example, is not the 
<A NAME="984"></A>same with that which regulates contracts in the market.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="985"></A><B>Part XVI</B>

<A NAME="986"></A><BR><BR>Of the three parts of government, the judicial remains to be considered, 
<A NAME="987"></A>and this we shall divide on the same principle. There are three points 
<A NAME="988"></A>on which the variedes of law-courts depend: The persons from whom they 
<A NAME="989"></A>are appointed, the matters with which they are concerned, and the manner 
<A NAME="990"></A>of their appointment. I mean, (1) are the judges taken from all, or from 
<A NAME="991"></A>some only? (2) how many kinds of law-courts are there? (3) are the judges 
<A NAME="992"></A>chosen by vote or by lot?
<A NAME="993"></A><BR><BR>First, let me determine how many kinds of law-courts there are. 
<A NAME="994"></A>There are eight in number: One is the court of audits or scrutinies; a 
<A NAME="995"></A>second takes cognizance of ordinary offenses against the state; a third 
<A NAME="996"></A>is concerned with treason against the constitution; the fourth determines 
<A NAME="997"></A>disputes respecting penalties, whether raised by magistrates or by private 
<A NAME="998"></A>persons; the fifth decides the more important civil cases; the sixth tries 
<A NAME="999"></A>cases of homicide, which are of various kinds, (a) premeditated, (b) involuntary, 
<A NAME="1000"></A>(c) cases in which the guilt is confessed but the justice is disputed; 
<A NAME="1001"></A>and there may be a fourth court (d) in which murderers who have fled from 
<A NAME="1002"></A>justice are tried after their return; such as the Court of Phreatto is 
<A NAME="1003"></A>said to be at Athens. But cases of this sort rarely happen at all even 
<A NAME="1004"></A>in large cities. The different kinds of homicide may be tried either by 
<A NAME="1005"></A>the same or by different courts. (7) There are courts for strangers: of 
<A NAME="1006"></A>these there are two subdivisions, (a) for the settlement of their disputes 
<A NAME="1007"></A>with one another, (b) for the settlement of disputes between them and the 
<A NAME="1008"></A>citizens. And besides all these there must be (8) courts for small suits 
<A NAME="1009"></A>about sums of a drachma up to five drachmas, or a little more, which have 
<A NAME="1010"></A>to be determined, but they do not require many judges.
<A NAME="1011"></A><BR><BR>Nothing more need be said of these small suits, nor of the courts 
<A NAME="1012"></A>for homicide and for strangers: I would rather speak of political cases, 
<A NAME="1013"></A>which, when mismanaged, create division and disturbances in 
<A NAME="1014"></A>constitutions.
<A NAME="1015"></A><BR><BR>Now if all the citizens judge, in all the different cases which 
<A NAME="1016"></A>I have distinguished, they may be appointed by vote or by lot, or sometimes 
<A NAME="1017"></A>by lot and sometimes by vote. Or when a single class of causes are tried, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>the judges who decide them may be appointed, some by vote, and some by 
<A NAME="1019"></A>lot. These then are the four modes of appointing judges from the whole 
<A NAME="1020"></A>people, and there will be likewise four modes, if they are elected from 
<A NAME="1021"></A>a part only; for they may be appointed from some by vote and judge in all 
<A NAME="1022"></A>causes; or they may be appointed from some by lot and judge in all causes; 
<A NAME="1023"></A>or they may be elected in some cases by vote, and in some cases taken by 
<A NAME="1024"></A>lot, or some courts, even when judging the same causes, may be composed 
<A NAME="1025"></A>of members some appointed by vote and some by lot. These modes, then, as 
<A NAME="1026"></A>was said, answer to those previously mentioned.
<A NAME="1027"></A><BR><BR>Once more, the modes of appointment may be combined; I mean, that 
<A NAME="1028"></A>some may be chosen out of the whole people, others out of some, some out 
<A NAME="1029"></A>of both; for example, the same tribunal may be composed of some who were 
<A NAME="1030"></A>elected out of all, and of others who were elected out of some, either 
<A NAME="1031"></A>by vote or by lot or by both.
<A NAME="1032"></A><BR><BR>In how many forms law-courts can be established has now been considered. 
<A NAME="1033"></A>The first form, viz., that in which the judges are taken from all the citizens, 
<A NAME="1034"></A>and in which all causes are tried, is democratical; the second, which is 
<A NAME="1035"></A>composed of a few only who try all causes, oligarchical; the third, in 
<A NAME="1036"></A>which some courts are taken from all classes, and some from certain classes 
<A NAME="1037"></A>only, aristocratical and constitutional.
