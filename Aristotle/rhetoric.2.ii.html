<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>We have now considered the materials to be used in supporting or opposing 
<A NAME="12"></A>a political measure, in pronouncing eulogies or censures, and for prosecution 
<A NAME="13"></A>and defence in the law courts. We have considered the received opinions 
<A NAME="14"></A>on which we may best base our arguments so as to convince our hearers-those 
<A NAME="15"></A>opinions with which our enthymemes deal, and out of which they are built, 
<A NAME="16"></A>in each of the three kinds of oratory, according to what may be called 
<A NAME="17"></A>the special needs of each.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>But since rhetoric exists to affect the giving of decisions-the 
<A NAME="19"></A>hearers decide between one political speaker and another, and a legal verdict 
<A NAME="20"></A>is a decision-the orator must not only try to make the argument of his 
<A NAME="21"></A>speech demonstrative and worthy of belief; he must also make his own character 
<A NAME="22"></A>look right and put his hearers, who are to decide, into the right frame 
<A NAME="23"></A>of mind. Particularly in political oratory, but also in lawsuits, it adds 
<A NAME="24"></A>much to an orator's influence that his own character should look right 
<A NAME="25"></A>and that he should be thought to entertain the right feelings towards his 
<A NAME="26"></A>hearers; and also that his hearers themselves should be in just the right 
<A NAME="27"></A>frame of mind. That the orator's own character should look right is particularly 
<A NAME="28"></A>important in political speaking: that the audience should be in the right 
<A NAME="29"></A>frame of mind, in lawsuits. When people are feeling friendly and placable, 
<A NAME="30"></A>they think one sort of thing; when they are feeling angry or hostile, they 
<A NAME="31"></A>think either something totally different or the same thing with a different 
<A NAME="32"></A>intensity: when they feel friendly to the man who comes before them for 
<A NAME="33"></A>judgement, they regard him as having done little wrong, if any; when they 
<A NAME="34"></A>feel hostile, they take the opposite view. Again, if they are eager for, 
<A NAME="35"></A>and have good hopes of, a thing that will be pleasant if it happens, they 
<A NAME="36"></A>think that it certainly will happen and be good for them: whereas if they 
<A NAME="37"></A>are indifferent or annoyed, they do not think so.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>There are three things which inspire confidence in the orator's 
<A NAME="39"></A>own character-the three, namely, that induce us to believe a thing apart 
<A NAME="40"></A>from any proof of it: good sense, good moral character, and goodwill. False 
<A NAME="41"></A>statements and bad advice are due to one or more of the following three 
<A NAME="42"></A>causes. Men either form a false opinion through want of good sense; or 
<A NAME="43"></A>they form a true opinion, but because of their moral badness do not say 
<A NAME="44"></A>what they really think; or finally, they are both sensible and upright, 
<A NAME="45"></A>but not well disposed to their hearers, and may fail in consequence to 
<A NAME="46"></A>recommend what they know to be the best course. These are the only possible 
<A NAME="47"></A>cases. It follows that any one who is thought to have all three of these 
<A NAME="48"></A>good qualities will inspire trust in his audience. The way to make ourselves 
<A NAME="49"></A>thought to be sensible and morally good must be gathered from the analysis 
<A NAME="50"></A>of goodness already given: the way to establish your own goodness is the 
<A NAME="51"></A>same as the way to establish that of others. Good will and friendliness 
<A NAME="52"></A>of disposition will form part of our discussion of the emotions, to which 
<A NAME="53"></A>we must now turn.
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>The Emotions are all those feelings that so change men as to affect 
<A NAME="55"></A>their judgements, and that are also attended by pain or pleasure. Such 
<A NAME="56"></A>are anger, pity, fear and the like, with their opposites. We must arrange 
<A NAME="57"></A>what we have to say about each of them under three heads. Take, for instance, 
<A NAME="58"></A>the emotion of anger: here we must discover (1) what the state of mind 
<A NAME="59"></A>of angry people is, (2) who the people are with whom they usually get angry, 
<A NAME="60"></A>and (3) on what grounds they get angry with them. It is not enough to know 
<A NAME="61"></A>one or even two of these points; unless we know all three, we shall be 
<A NAME="62"></A>unable to arouse anger in any one. The same is true of the other emotions. 
<A NAME="63"></A>So just as earlier in this work we drew up a list of useful propositions 
<A NAME="64"></A>for the orator, let us now proceed in the same way to analyse the subject 
<A NAME="65"></A>before us.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="66"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>Anger may be defined as an impulse, accompanied by pain, to a conspicuous 
<A NAME="68"></A>revenge for a conspicuous slight directed without justification towards 
<A NAME="69"></A>what concerns oneself or towards what concerns one's friends. If this is 
<A NAME="70"></A>a proper definition of anger, it must always be felt towards some particular 
<A NAME="71"></A>individual, e.g. Cleon, and not 'man' in general. It must be felt because 
<A NAME="72"></A>the other has done or intended to do something to him or one of his friends. 
<A NAME="73"></A>It must always be attended by a certain pleasure-that which arises from 
<A NAME="74"></A>the expectation of revenge. For since nobody aims at what he thinks he 
<A NAME="75"></A>cannot attain, the angry man is aiming at what he can attain, and the belief 
<A NAME="76"></A>that you will attain your aim is pleasant. Hence it has been well said 
<A NAME="77"></A>about wrath, <BR><BR>"Sweeter it is by far than the honeycomb <BR><BR>"dripping 
<A NAME="78"></A>with sweetness, <BR><BR>"And spreads through the hearts of men. 
<A NAME="79"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="80"></A>It is also attended by a certain pleasure because the thoughts dwell upon 
<A NAME="81"></A>the act of vengeance, and the images then called up cause pleasure, like 
<A NAME="82"></A>the images called up in dreams.
<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>Now slighting is the actively entertained opinion of something 
<A NAME="84"></A>as obviously of no importance. We think bad things, as well as good ones, 
<A NAME="85"></A>have serious importance; and we think the same of anything that tends to 
<A NAME="86"></A>produce such things, while those which have little or no such tendency 
<A NAME="87"></A>we consider unimportant. There are three kinds of slighting-contempt, spite, 
<A NAME="88"></A>and insolence. (1) Contempt is one kind of slighting: you feel contempt 
<A NAME="89"></A>for what you consider unimportant, and it is just such things that you 
<A NAME="90"></A>slight. (2) Spite is another kind; it is a thwarting another man's wishes, 
<A NAME="91"></A>not to get something yourself but to prevent his getting it. The slight 
<A NAME="92"></A>arises just from the fact that you do not aim at something for yourself: 
<A NAME="93"></A>clearly you do not think that he can do you harm, for then you would be 
<A NAME="94"></A>afraid of him instead of slighting him, nor yet that he can do you any 
<A NAME="95"></A>good worth mentioning, for then you would be anxious to make friends with 
<A NAME="96"></A>him. (3) Insolence is also a form of slighting, since it consists in doing 
<A NAME="97"></A>and saying things that cause shame to the victim, not in order that anything 
<A NAME="98"></A>may happen to yourself, or because anything has happened to yourself, but 
<A NAME="99"></A>simply for the pleasure involved. (Retaliation is not 'insolence', but 
<A NAME="100"></A>vengeance.) The cause of the pleasure thus enjoyed by the insolent man 
<A NAME="101"></A>is that he thinks himself greatly superior to others when ill-treating 
<A NAME="102"></A>them. That is why youths and rich men are insolent; they think themselves 
<A NAME="103"></A>superior when they show insolence. One sort of insolence is to rob people 
<A NAME="104"></A>of the honour due to them; you certainly slight them thus; for it is the 
<A NAME="105"></A>unimportant, for good or evil, that has no honour paid to it. So Achilles 
<A NAME="106"></A>says in anger: <BR><BR>"He hath taken my prize for himself <BR><BR>"and 
<A NAME="107"></A>hath done me dishonour, "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="108"></A>and <BR><BR>"Like an alien honoured by none, "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="109"></A>meaning that this is why he is angry. A man expects to be specially respected 
<A NAME="110"></A>by his inferiors in birth, in capacity, in goodness, and generally in anything 
<A NAME="111"></A>in which he is much their superior: as where money is concerned a wealthy 
<A NAME="112"></A>man looks for respect from a poor man; where speaking is concerned, the 
<A NAME="113"></A>man with a turn for oratory looks for respect from one who cannot speak; 
<A NAME="114"></A>the ruler demands the respect of the ruled, and the man who thinks he ought 
<A NAME="115"></A>to be a ruler demands the respect of the man whom he thinks he ought to 
<A NAME="116"></A>be ruling. Hence it has been said <BR><BR>"Great is the wrath of kings, 
<A NAME="117"></A>whose father is Zeus almighty, "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="118"></A>and <BR><BR>"Yea, but his rancour abideth long afterward also, 
<A NAME="119"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="120"></A>their great resentment being due to their great superiority. Then again 
<A NAME="121"></A>a man looks for respect from those who he thinks owe him good treatment, 
<A NAME="122"></A>and these are the people whom he has treated or is treating well, or means 
<A NAME="123"></A>or has meant to treat well, either himself, or through his friends, or 
<A NAME="124"></A>through others at his request.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>It will be plain by now, from what has been said, (1) in what frame 
<A NAME="126"></A>of mind, (2) with what persons, and (3) on what grounds people grow angry. 
<A NAME="127"></A>(1) The frame of mind is that of one in which any pain is being felt. In 
<A NAME="128"></A>that condition, a man is always aiming at something. Whether, then, another 
<A NAME="129"></A>man opposes him either directly in any way, as by preventing him from drinking 
<A NAME="130"></A>when he is thirsty, or indirectly, the act appears to him just the same; 
<A NAME="131"></A>whether some one works against him, or fails to work with him, or otherwise 
<A NAME="132"></A>vexes him while he is in this mood, he is equally angry in all these cases. 
<A NAME="133"></A>Hence people who are afflicted by sickness or poverty or love or thirst 
<A NAME="134"></A>or any other unsatisfied desires are prone to anger and easily roused: 
<A NAME="135"></A>especially against those who slight their present distress. Thus a sick 
<A NAME="136"></A>man is angered by disregard of his illness, a poor man by disregard of 
<A NAME="137"></A>his poverty, a man aging war by disregard of the war he is waging, a lover 
<A NAME="138"></A>by disregard of his love, and so throughout, any other sort of slight being 
<A NAME="139"></A>enough if special slights are wanting. Each man is predisposed, by the 
<A NAME="140"></A>emotion now controlling him, to his own particular anger. Further, we are 
<A NAME="141"></A>angered if we happen to be expecting a contrary result: for a quite unexpected 
<A NAME="142"></A>evil is specially painful, just as the quite unexpected fulfilment of our 
<A NAME="143"></A>wishes is specially pleasant. Hence it is plain what seasons, times, conditions, 
<A NAME="144"></A>and periods of life tend to stir men easily to anger, and where and when 
<A NAME="145"></A>this will happen; and it is plain that the more we are under these conditions 
<A NAME="146"></A>the more easily we are stirred.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>These, then, are the frames of mind in which men are easily stirred 
<A NAME="148"></A>to anger. The persons with whom we get angry are those who laugh, mock, 
<A NAME="149"></A>or jeer at us, for such conduct is insolent. Also those who inflict injuries 
<A NAME="150"></A>upon us that are marks of insolence. These injuries must be such as are 
<A NAME="151"></A>neither retaliatory nor profitable to the doers: for only then will they 
<A NAME="152"></A>be felt to be due to insolence. Also those who speak ill of us, and show 
<A NAME="153"></A>contempt for us, in connexion with the things we ourselves most care about: 
<A NAME="154"></A>thus those who are eager to win fame as philosophers get angry with those 
<A NAME="155"></A>who show contempt for their philosophy; those who pride themselves upon 
<A NAME="156"></A>their appearance get angry with those who show contempt for their appearance 
<A NAME="157"></A>and so on in other cases. We feel particularly angry on this account if 
<A NAME="158"></A>we suspect that we are in fact, or that people think we are, lacking completely 
<A NAME="159"></A>or to any effective extent in the qualities in question. For when we are 
<A NAME="160"></A>convinced that we excel in the qualities for which we are jeered at, we 
<A NAME="161"></A>can ignore the jeering. Again, we are angrier with our friends than with 
<A NAME="162"></A>other people, since we feel that our friends ought to treat us well and 
<A NAME="163"></A>not badly. We are angry with those who have usually treated us with honour 
<A NAME="164"></A>or regard, if a change comes and they behave to us otherwise: for we think 
<A NAME="165"></A>that they feel contempt for us, or they would still be behaving as they 
<A NAME="166"></A>did before. And with those who do not return our kindnesses or fail to 
<A NAME="167"></A>return them adequately, and with those who oppose us though they are our 
<A NAME="168"></A>inferiors: for all such persons seem to feel contempt for us; those who 
<A NAME="169"></A>oppose us seem to think us inferior to themselves, and those who do not 
<A NAME="170"></A>return our kindnesses seem to think that those kindnesses were conferred 
<A NAME="171"></A>by inferiors. And we feel particularly angry with men of no account at 
<A NAME="172"></A>all, if they slight us. For, by our hypothesis, the anger caused by the 
<A NAME="173"></A>slight is felt towards people who are not justified in slighting us, and 
<A NAME="174"></A>our inferiors are not thus justified. Again, we feel angry with friends 
<A NAME="175"></A>if they do not speak well of us or treat us well; and still more, if they 
<A NAME="176"></A>do the contrary; or if they do not perceive our needs, which is why Plexippus 
<A NAME="177"></A>is angry with Meleager in Antiphon's play; for this want of perception 
<A NAME="178"></A>shows that they are slighting us-we do not fail to perceive the needs of 
<A NAME="179"></A>those for whom we care. Again we are angry with those who rejoice at our 
<A NAME="180"></A>misfortunes or simply keep cheerful in the midst of our misfortunes, since 
<A NAME="181"></A>this shows that they either hate us or are slighting us. Also with those 
<A NAME="182"></A>who are indifferent to the pain they give us: this is why we get angry 
<A NAME="183"></A>with bringers of bad news. And with those who listen to stories about us 
<A NAME="184"></A>or keep on looking at our weaknesses; this seems like either slighting 
<A NAME="185"></A>us or hating us; for those who love us share in all our distresses and 
<A NAME="186"></A>it must distress any one to keep on looking at his own weaknesses. Further, 
<A NAME="187"></A>with those who slight us before five classes of people: namely, (1) our 
<A NAME="188"></A>rivals, (2) those whom we admire, (3) those whom we wish to admire us, 
<A NAME="189"></A>(4) those for whom we feel reverence, (5) those who feel reverence for 
<A NAME="190"></A>us: if any one slights us before such persons, we feel particularly angry. 
<A NAME="191"></A>Again, we feel angry with those who slight us in connexion with what we 
<A NAME="192"></A>are as honourable men bound to champion-our parents, children, wives, or 
<A NAME="193"></A>subjects. And with those who do not return a favour, since such a slight 
<A NAME="194"></A>is unjustifiable. Also with those who reply with humorous levity when we 
<A NAME="195"></A>are speaking seriously, for such behaviour indicates contempt. And with 
<A NAME="196"></A>those who treat us less well than they treat everybody else; it is another 
<A NAME="197"></A>mark of contempt that they should think we do not deserve what every one 
<A NAME="198"></A>else deserves. Forgetfulness, too, causes anger, as when our own names 
<A NAME="199"></A>are forgotten, trifling as this may be; since forgetfulness is felt to 
<A NAME="200"></A>be another sign that we are being slighted; it is due to negligence, and 
<A NAME="201"></A>to neglect us is to slight us.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>The persons with whom we feel anger, the frame of mind in which 
<A NAME="203"></A>we feel it, and the reasons why we feel it, have now all been set forth. 
<A NAME="204"></A>Clearly the orator will have to speak so as to bring his hearers into a 
<A NAME="205"></A>frame of mind that will dispose them to anger, and to represent his adversaries 
<A NAME="206"></A>as open to such charges and possessed of such qualities as do make people 
<A NAME="207"></A>angry.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="208"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="209"></A><BR><BR>Since growing calm is the opposite of growing angry, and calmness 
<A NAME="210"></A>the opposite of anger, we must ascertain in what frames of mind men are 
<A NAME="211"></A>calm, towards whom they feel calm, and by what means they are made so. 
<A NAME="212"></A>Growing calm may be defined as a settling down or quieting of anger. Now 
<A NAME="213"></A>we get angry with those who slight us; and since slighting is a voluntary 
<A NAME="214"></A>act, it is plain that we feel calm towards those who do nothing of the 
<A NAME="215"></A>kind, or who do or seem to do it involuntarily. Also towards those who 
<A NAME="216"></A>intended to do the opposite of what they did do. Also towards those who 
<A NAME="217"></A>treat themselves as they have treated us: since no one can be supposed 
<A NAME="218"></A>to slight himself. Also towards those who admit their fault and are sorry: 
<A NAME="219"></A>since we accept their grief at what they have done as satisfaction, and 
<A NAME="220"></A>cease to be angry. The punishment of servants shows this: those who contradict 
<A NAME="221"></A>us and deny their offence we punish all the more, but we cease to be incensed 
<A NAME="222"></A>against those who agree that they deserved their punishment. The reason 
<A NAME="223"></A>is that it is shameless to deny what is obvious, and those who are shameless 
<A NAME="224"></A>towards us slight us and show contempt for us: anyhow, we do not feel shame 
<A NAME="225"></A>before those of whom we are thoroughly contemptuous. Also we feel calm 
<A NAME="226"></A>towards those who humble themselves before us and do not gainsay us; we 
<A NAME="227"></A>feel that they thus admit themselves our inferiors, and inferiors feel 
<A NAME="228"></A>fear, and nobody can slight any one so long as he feels afraid of him. 
<A NAME="229"></A>That our anger ceases towards those who humble themselves before us is 
<A NAME="230"></A>shown even by dogs, who do not bite people when they sit down. We also 
<A NAME="231"></A>feel calm towards those who are serious when we are serious, because then 
<A NAME="232"></A>we feel that we are treated seriously and not contemptuously. Also towards 
<A NAME="233"></A>those who have done us more kindnesses than we have done them. Also towards 
<A NAME="234"></A>those who pray to us and beg for mercy, since they humble themselves by 
<A NAME="235"></A>doing so. Also towards those who do not insult or mock at or slight any 
<A NAME="236"></A>one at all, or not any worthy person or any one like ourselves. In general, 
<A NAME="237"></A>the things that make us calm may be inferred by seeing what the opposites 
<A NAME="238"></A>are of those that make us angry. We are not angry with people we fear or 
<A NAME="239"></A>respect, as long as we fear or respect them; you cannot be afraid of a 
<A NAME="240"></A>person and also at the same time angry with him. Again, we feel no anger, 
<A NAME="241"></A>or comparatively little, with those who have done what they did through 
<A NAME="242"></A>anger: we do not feel that they have done it from a wish to slight us, 
<A NAME="243"></A>for no one slights people when angry with them, since slighting is painless, 
<A NAME="244"></A>and anger is painful. Nor do we grow angry with those who reverence 
<A NAME="245"></A>us.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>As to the frame of mind that makes people calm, it is plainly the 
<A NAME="247"></A>opposite to that which makes them angry, as when they are amusing themselves 
<A NAME="248"></A>or laughing or feasting; when they are feeling prosperous or successful 
<A NAME="249"></A>or satisfied; when, in fine, they are enjoying freedom from pain, or inoffensive 
<A NAME="250"></A>pleasure, or justifiable hope. Also when time has passed and their anger 
<A NAME="251"></A>is no longer fresh, for time puts an end to anger. And vengeance previously 
<A NAME="252"></A>taken on one person puts an end to even greater anger felt against another 
<A NAME="253"></A>person. Hence Philocrates, being asked by some one, at a time when the 
<A NAME="254"></A>public was angry with him, 'Why don't you defend yourself?' did right to 
<A NAME="255"></A>reply, 'The time is not yet.' 'Why, when is the time?' 'When I see someone 
<A NAME="256"></A>else calumniated.' For men become calm when they have spent their anger 
<A NAME="257"></A>on somebody else. This happened in the case of Ergophilus: though the people 
<A NAME="258"></A>were more irritated against him than against Callisthenes, they acquitted 
<A NAME="259"></A>him because they had condemned Callisthenes to death the day before. Again, 
<A NAME="260"></A>men become calm if they have convicted the offender; or if he has already 
<A NAME="261"></A>suffered worse things than they in their anger would have themselves inflicted 
<A NAME="262"></A>upon him; for they feel as if they were already avenged. Or if they feel 
<A NAME="263"></A>that they themselves are in the wrong and are suffering justly (for anger 
<A NAME="264"></A>is not excited by what is just), since men no longer think then that they 
<A NAME="265"></A>are suffering without justification; and anger, as we have seen, means 
<A NAME="266"></A>this. Hence we ought always to inflict a preliminary punishment in words: 
<A NAME="267"></A>if that is done, even slaves are less aggrieved by the actual punishment. 
<A NAME="268"></A>We also feel calm if we think that the offender will not see that he is 
<A NAME="269"></A>punished on our account and because of the way he has treated us. For anger 
<A NAME="270"></A>has to do with individuals. This is plain from the definition. Hence the 
<A NAME="271"></A>poet has well written: <BR><BR>"Say that it was Odysseus, sacker of cities, 
<A NAME="272"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="273"></A>implying that Odysseus would not have considered himself avenged unless 
<A NAME="274"></A>the Cyclops perceived both by whom and for what he had been blinded. Consequently 
<A NAME="275"></A>we do not get angry with any one who cannot be aware of our anger, and 
<A NAME="276"></A>in particular we cease to be angry with people once they are dead, for 
<A NAME="277"></A>we feel that the worst has been done to them, and that they will neither 
<A NAME="278"></A>feel pain nor anything else that we in our anger aim at making them feel. 
<A NAME="279"></A>And therefore the poet has well made Apollo say, in order to put a stop 
<A NAME="280"></A>to the anger of Achilles against the dead Hector, <BR><BR>"For behold in 
<A NAME="281"></A>his fury he doeth despite to the senseless clay. "<BR><BR>

<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>It is now plain that when you wish to calm others you must draw 
<A NAME="283"></A>upon these lines of argument; you must put your hearers into the corresponding 
<A NAME="284"></A>frame of mind, and represent those with whom they are angry as formidable, 
<A NAME="285"></A>or as worthy of reverence, or as benefactors, or as involuntary agents, 
<A NAME="286"></A>or as much distressed at what they have done.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="287"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>Let us now turn to Friendship and Enmity, and ask towards whom 
<A NAME="289"></A>these feelings are entertained, and why. We will begin by defining and 
<A NAME="290"></A>friendly feeling. We may describe friendly feeling towards any one as wishing 
<A NAME="291"></A>for him what you believe to be good things, not for your own sake but for 
<A NAME="292"></A>his, and being inclined, so far as you can, to bring these things about. 
<A NAME="293"></A>A friend is one who feels thus and excites these feelings in return: those 
<A NAME="294"></A>who think they feel thus towards each other think themselves friends. This 
<A NAME="295"></A>being assumed, it follows that your friend is the sort of man who shares 
<A NAME="296"></A>your pleasure in what is good and your pain in what is unpleasant, for 
<A NAME="297"></A>your sake and for no other reason. This pleasure and pain of his will be 
<A NAME="298"></A>the token of his good wishes for you, since we all feel glad at getting 
<A NAME="299"></A>what we wish for, and pained at getting what we do not. Those, then, are 
<A NAME="300"></A>friends to whom the same things are good and evil; and those who are, moreover, 
<A NAME="301"></A>friendly or unfriendly to the same people; for in that case they must have 
<A NAME="302"></A>the same wishes, and thus by wishing for each other what they wish for 
<A NAME="303"></A>themselves, they show themselves each other's friends. Again, we feel friendly 
<A NAME="304"></A>to those who have treated us well, either ourselves or those we care for, 
<A NAME="305"></A>whether on a large scale, or readily, or at some particular crisis; provided 
<A NAME="306"></A>it was for our own sake. And also to those who we think wish to treat us 
<A NAME="307"></A>well. And also to our friends' friends, and to those who like, or are liked 
<A NAME="308"></A>by, those whom we like ourselves. And also to those who are enemies to 
<A NAME="309"></A>those whose enemies we are, and dislike, or are disliked by, those whom 
<A NAME="310"></A>we dislike. For all such persons think the things good which we think good, 
<A NAME="311"></A>so that they wish what is good for us; and this, as we saw, is what friends 
<A NAME="312"></A>must do. And also to those who are willing to treat us well where money 
<A NAME="313"></A>or our personal safety is concerned: and therefore we value those who are 
<A NAME="314"></A>liberal, brave, or just. The just we consider to be those who do not live 
<A NAME="315"></A>on others; which means those who work for their living, especially farmers 
<A NAME="316"></A>and others who work with their own hands. We also like temperate men, because 
<A NAME="317"></A>they are not unjust to others; and, for the same reason, those who mind 
<A NAME="318"></A>their own business. And also those whose friends we wish to be, if it is 
<A NAME="319"></A>plain that they wish to be our friends: such are the morally good, and 
<A NAME="320"></A>those well thought of by every one, by the best men, or by those whom we 
<A NAME="321"></A>admire or who admire us. And also those with whom it is pleasant to live 
<A NAME="322"></A>and spend our days: such are the good-tempered, and those who are not too 
<A NAME="323"></A>ready to show us our mistakes, and those who are not cantankerous or quarrelsome-such 
<A NAME="324"></A>people are always wanting to fight us, and those who fight us we feel wish 
<A NAME="325"></A>for the opposite of what we wish for ourselves-and those who have the tact 
<A NAME="326"></A>to make and take a joke; here both parties have the same object in view, 
<A NAME="327"></A>when they can stand being made fun of as well as do it prettily themselves. 
<A NAME="328"></A>And we also feel friendly towards those who praise such good qualities 
<A NAME="329"></A>as we possess, and especially if they praise the good qualities that we 
<A NAME="330"></A>are not too sure we do possess. And towards those who are cleanly in their 
<A NAME="331"></A>person, their dress, and all their way of life. And towards those who do 
<A NAME="332"></A>not reproach us with what we have done amiss to them or they have done 
<A NAME="333"></A>to help us, for both actions show a tendency to criticize us. And towards 
<A NAME="334"></A>those who do not nurse grudges or store up grievances, but are always ready 
<A NAME="335"></A>to make friends again; for we take it that they will behave to us just 
<A NAME="336"></A>as we find them behaving to every one else. And towards those who are not 
<A NAME="337"></A>evil speakers and who are aware of neither their neighbours' bad points 
<A NAME="338"></A>nor our own, but of our good ones only, as a good man always will be. And 
<A NAME="339"></A>towards those who do not try to thwart us when we are angry or in earnest, 
<A NAME="340"></A>which would mean being ready to fight us. And towards those who have some 
<A NAME="341"></A>serious feeling towards us, such as admiration for us, or belief in our 
<A NAME="342"></A>goodness, or pleasure in our company; especially if they feel like this 
<A NAME="343"></A>about qualities in us for which we especially wish to be admired, esteemed, 
<A NAME="344"></A>or liked. And towards those who are like ourselves in character and occupation, 
<A NAME="345"></A>provided they do not get in our way or gain their living from the same 
<A NAME="346"></A>source as we do-for then it will be a case of 'potter against potter': 
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>"Potter to potter and builder to builder begrudge their reward. 
<A NAME="348"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="349"></A>And those who desire the same things as we desire, if it is possible for 
<A NAME="350"></A>us both to share them together; otherwise the same trouble arises here 
<A NAME="351"></A>too. And towards those with whom we are on such terms that, while we respect 
<A NAME="352"></A>their opinions, we need not blush before them for doing what is conventionally 
<A NAME="353"></A>wrong: as well as towards those before whom we should be ashamed to do 
<A NAME="354"></A>anything really wrong. Again, our rivals, and those whom we should like 
<A NAME="355"></A>to envy us--though without ill-feeling--either we like these people or 
<A NAME="356"></A>at least we wish them to like us. And we feel friendly towards those whom 
<A NAME="357"></A>we help to secure good for themselves, provided we are not likely to suffer 
<A NAME="358"></A>heavily by it ourselves. And those who feel as friendly to us when we are 
<A NAME="359"></A>not with them as when we are-which is why all men feel friendly towards 
<A NAME="360"></A>those who are faithful to their dead friends. And, speaking generally, 
<A NAME="361"></A>towards those who are really fond of their friends and do not desert them 
<A NAME="362"></A>in trouble; of all good men, we feel most friendly to those who show their 
<A NAME="363"></A>goodness as friends. Also towards those who are honest with us, including 
<A NAME="364"></A>those who will tell us of their own weak points: it has just said that 
<A NAME="365"></A>with our friends we are not ashamed of what is conventionally wrong, and 
<A NAME="366"></A>if we do have this feeling, we do not love them; if therefore we do not 
<A NAME="367"></A>have it, it looks as if we did love them. We also like those with whom 
<A NAME="368"></A>we do not feel frightened or uncomfortable-nobody can like a man of whom 
<A NAME="369"></A>he feels frightened. Friendship has various forms-comradeship, intimacy, 
<A NAME="370"></A>kinship, and so on.
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>Things that cause friendship are: doing kindnesses; doing them 
<A NAME="372"></A>unasked; and not proclaiming the fact when they are done, which shows that 
<A NAME="373"></A>they were done for our own sake and not for some other 
<A NAME="374"></A>reason.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>Enmity and Hatred should clearly be studied by reference to their 
<A NAME="376"></A>opposites. Enmity may be produced by anger or spite or calumny. Now whereas 
<A NAME="377"></A>anger arises from offences against oneself, enmity may arise even without 
<A NAME="378"></A>that; we may hate people merely because of what we take to be their character. 
<A NAME="379"></A>Anger is always concerned with individuals-a Callias or a Socrates-whereas 
<A NAME="380"></A>hatred is directed also against classes: we all hate any thief and any 
<A NAME="381"></A>informer. Moreover, anger can be cured by time; but hatred cannot. The 
<A NAME="382"></A>one aims at giving pain to its object, the other at doing him harm; the 
<A NAME="383"></A>angry man wants his victims to feel; the hater does not mind whether they 
<A NAME="384"></A>feel or not. All painful things are felt; but the greatest evils, injustice 
<A NAME="385"></A>and folly, are the least felt, since their presence causes no pain. And 
<A NAME="386"></A>anger is accompanied by pain, hatred is not; the angry man feels pain, 
<A NAME="387"></A>but the hater does not. Much may happen to make the angry man pity those 
<A NAME="388"></A>who offend him, but the hater under no circumstances wishes to pity a man 
<A NAME="389"></A>whom he has once hated: for the one would have the offenders suffer for 
<A NAME="390"></A>what they have done; the other would have them cease to 
<A NAME="391"></A>exist.
<A NAME="392"></A><BR><BR>It is plain from all this that we can prove people to be friends 
<A NAME="393"></A>or enemies; if they are not, we can make them out to be so; if they claim 
<A NAME="394"></A>to be so, we can refute their claim; and if it is disputed whether an action 
<A NAME="395"></A>was due to anger or to hatred, we can attribute it to whichever of these 
<A NAME="396"></A>we prefer.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="397"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="398"></A><BR><BR>To turn next to Fear, what follows will show things and persons 
<A NAME="399"></A>of which, and the states of mind in which, we feel afraid. Fear may be 
<A NAME="400"></A>defined as a pain or disturbance due to a mental picture of some destructive 
<A NAME="401"></A>or painful evil in the future. Of destructive or painful evils only; for 
<A NAME="402"></A>there are some evils, e.g. wickedness or stupidity, the prospect of which 
<A NAME="403"></A>does not frighten us: I mean only such as amount to great pains or losses. 
<A NAME="404"></A>And even these only if they appear not remote but so near as to be imminent: 
<A NAME="405"></A>we do not fear things that are a very long way off: for instance, we all 
<A NAME="406"></A>know we shall die, but we are not troubled thereby, because death is not 
<A NAME="407"></A>close at hand. From this definition it will follow that fear is caused 
<A NAME="408"></A>by whatever we feel has great power of destroying or of harming us in ways 
<A NAME="409"></A>that tend to cause us great pain. Hence the very indications of such things 
<A NAME="410"></A>are terrible, making us feel that the terrible thing itself is close at 
<A NAME="411"></A>hand; the approach of what is terrible is just what we mean by 'danger'. 
<A NAME="412"></A>Such indications are the enmity and anger of people who have power to do 
<A NAME="413"></A>something to us; for it is plain that they have the will to do it, and 
<A NAME="414"></A>so they are on the point of doing it. Also injustice in possession of power; 
<A NAME="415"></A>for it is the unjust man's will to do evil that makes him unjust. Also 
<A NAME="416"></A>outraged virtue in possession of power; for it is plain that, when outraged, 
<A NAME="417"></A>it always has the will to retaliate, and now it has the power to do so. 
<A NAME="418"></A>Also fear felt by those who have the power to do something to us, since 
<A NAME="419"></A>such persons are sure to be ready to do it. And since most men tend to 
<A NAME="420"></A>be bad-slaves to greed, and cowards in danger-it is, as a rule, a terrible 
<A NAME="421"></A>thing to be at another man's mercy; and therefore, if we have done anything 
<A NAME="422"></A>horrible, those in the secret terrify us with the thought that they may 
<A NAME="423"></A>betray or desert us. And those who can do us wrong are terrible to us when 
<A NAME="424"></A>we are liable to be wronged; for as a rule men do wrong to others whenever 
<A NAME="425"></A>they have the power to do it. And those who have been wronged, or believe 
<A NAME="426"></A>themselves to be wronged, are terrible; for they are always looking out 
<A NAME="427"></A>for their opportunity. Also those who have done people wrong, if they possess 
<A NAME="428"></A>power, since they stand in fear of retaliation: we have already said that 
<A NAME="429"></A>wickedness possessing power is terrible. Again, our rivals for a thing 
<A NAME="430"></A>cause us fear when we cannot both have it at once; for we are always at 
<A NAME="431"></A>war with such men. We also fear those who are to be feared by stronger 
<A NAME="432"></A>people than ourselves: if they can hurt those stronger people, still more 
<A NAME="433"></A>can they hurt us; and, for the same reason, we fear those whom those stronger 
<A NAME="434"></A>people are actually afraid of. Also those who have destroyed people stronger 
<A NAME="435"></A>than we are. Also those who are attacking people weaker than we are: either 
<A NAME="436"></A>they are already formidable, or they will be so when they have thus grown 
<A NAME="437"></A>stronger. Of those we have wronged, and of our enemies or rivals, it is 
<A NAME="438"></A>not the passionate and outspoken whom we have to fear, but the quiet, dissembling, 
<A NAME="439"></A>unscrupulous; since we never know when they are upon us, we can never be 
<A NAME="440"></A>sure they are at a safe distance. All terrible things are more terrible 
<A NAME="441"></A>if they give us no chance of retrieving a blunder either no chance at all, 
<A NAME="442"></A>or only one that depends on our enemies and not ourselves. Those things 
<A NAME="443"></A>are also worse which we cannot, or cannot easily, help. Speaking generally, 
<A NAME="444"></A>anything causes us to feel fear that when it happens to, or threatens, 
<A NAME="445"></A>others cause us to feel pity.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR>The above are, roughly, the chief things that are terrible and 
<A NAME="447"></A>are feared. Let us now describe the conditions under which we ourselves 
<A NAME="448"></A>feel fear. If fear is associated with the expectation that something destructive 
<A NAME="449"></A>will happen to us, plainly nobody will be afraid who believes nothing can 
<A NAME="450"></A>happen to him; we shall not fear things that we believe cannot happen to 
<A NAME="451"></A>us, nor people who we believe cannot inflict them upon us; nor shall we 
<A NAME="452"></A>be afraid at times when we think ourselves safe from them. It follows therefore 
<A NAME="453"></A>that fear is felt by those who believe something to be likely to happen 
<A NAME="454"></A>to them, at the hands of particular persons, in a particular form, and 
<A NAME="455"></A>at a particular time. People do not believe this when they are, or think 
<A NAME="456"></A>they a are, in the midst of great prosperity, and are in consequence insolent, 
<A NAME="457"></A>contemptuous, and reckless-the kind of character produced by wealth, physical 
<A NAME="458"></A>strength, abundance of friends, power: nor yet when they feel they have 
<A NAME="459"></A>experienced every kind of horror already and have grown callous about the 
<A NAME="460"></A>future, like men who are being flogged and are already nearly dead-if they 
<A NAME="461"></A>are to feel the anguish of uncertainty, there must be some faint expectation 
<A NAME="462"></A>of escape. This appears from the fact that fear sets us thinking what can 
<A NAME="463"></A>be done, which of course nobody does when things are hopeless. Consequently, 
<A NAME="464"></A>when it is advisable that the audience should be frightened, the orator 
<A NAME="465"></A>must make them feel that they really are in danger of something, pointing 
<A NAME="466"></A>out that it has happened to others who were stronger than they are, and 
<A NAME="467"></A>is happening, or has happened, to people like themselves, at the hands 
<A NAME="468"></A>of unexpected people, in an unexpected form, and at an unexpected 
<A NAME="469"></A>time.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>Having now seen the nature of fear, and of the things that cause 
<A NAME="471"></A>it, and the various states of mind in which it is felt, we can also see 
<A NAME="472"></A>what Confidence is, about what things we feel it, and under what conditions. 
<A NAME="473"></A>It is the opposite of fear, and what causes it is the opposite of what 
<A NAME="474"></A>causes fear; it is, therefore, the expectation associated with a mental 
<A NAME="475"></A>picture of the nearness of what keeps us safe and the absence or remoteness 
<A NAME="476"></A>of what is terrible: it may be due either to the near presence of what 
<A NAME="477"></A>inspires confidence or to the absence of what causes alarm. We feel it 
<A NAME="478"></A>if we can take steps-many, or important, or both-to cure or prevent trouble; 
<A NAME="479"></A>if we have neither wronged others nor been wronged by them; if we have 
<A NAME="480"></A>either no rivals at all or no strong ones; if our rivals who are strong 
<A NAME="481"></A>are our friends or have treated us well or been treated well by us; or 
<A NAME="482"></A>if those whose interest is the same as ours are the more numerous party, 
<A NAME="483"></A>or the stronger, or both.
<A NAME="484"></A><BR><BR>As for our own state of mind, we feel confidence if we believe 
<A NAME="485"></A>we have often succeeded and never suffered reverses, or have often met 
<A NAME="486"></A>danger and escaped it safely. For there are two reasons why human beings 
<A NAME="487"></A>face danger calmly: they may have no experience of it, or they may have 
<A NAME="488"></A>means to deal with it: thus when in danger at sea people may feel confident 
<A NAME="489"></A>about what will happen either because they have no experience of bad weather, 
<A NAME="490"></A>or because their experience gives them the means of dealing with it. We 
<A NAME="491"></A>also feel confident whenever there is nothing to terrify other people like 
<A NAME="492"></A>ourselves, or people weaker than ourselves, or people than whom we believe 
<A NAME="493"></A>ourselves to be stronger-and we believe this if we have conquered them, 
<A NAME="494"></A>or conquered others who are as strong as they are, or stronger. Also if 
<A NAME="495"></A>we believe ourselves superior to our rivals in the number and importance 
<A NAME="496"></A>of the advantages that make men formidable-wealth, physical strength, strong 
<A NAME="497"></A>bodies of supporters, extensive territory, and the possession of all, or 
<A NAME="498"></A>the most important, appliances of war. Also if we have wronged no one, 
<A NAME="499"></A>or not many, or not those of whom we are afraid; and generally, if our 
<A NAME="500"></A>relations with the gods are satisfactory, as will be shown especially by 
<A NAME="501"></A>signs and oracles. The fact is that anger makes us confident-that anger 
<A NAME="502"></A>is excited by our knowledge that we are not the wrongers but the wronged, 
<A NAME="503"></A>and that the divine power is always supposed to be on the side of the wronged. 
<A NAME="504"></A>Also when, at the outset of an enterprise, we believe that we cannot and 
<A NAME="505"></A>shall not fail, or that we shall succeed completely.-So much for the causes 
<A NAME="506"></A>of fear and confidence.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="507"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>We now turn to Shame and Shamelessness; what follows will explain 
<A NAME="509"></A>the things that cause these feelings, and the persons before whom, and 
<A NAME="510"></A>the states of mind under which, they are felt. Shame may be defined as 
<A NAME="511"></A>pain or disturbance in regard to bad things, whether present, past, or 
<A NAME="512"></A>future, which seem likely to involve us in discredit; and shamelessness 
<A NAME="513"></A>as contempt or indifference in regard to these same bad things. If this 
<A NAME="514"></A>definition be granted, it follows that we feel shame at such bad things 
<A NAME="515"></A>as we think are disgraceful to ourselves or to those we care for. These 
<A NAME="516"></A>evils are, in the first place, those due to moral badness. Such are throwing 
<A NAME="517"></A>away one's shield or taking to flight; for these bad things are due to 
<A NAME="518"></A>cowardice. Also, withholding a deposit or otherwise wronging people about 
<A NAME="519"></A>money; for these acts are due to injustice. Also, having carnal intercourse 
<A NAME="520"></A>with forbidden persons, at wrong times, or in wrong places; for these things 
<A NAME="521"></A>are due to licentiousness. Also, making profit in petty or disgraceful 
<A NAME="522"></A>ways, or out of helpless persons, e.g. the poor, or the dead-whence the 
<A NAME="523"></A>proverb 'He would pick a corpse's pocket'; for all this is due to low greed 
<A NAME="524"></A>and meanness. Also, in money matters, giving less help than you might, 
<A NAME="525"></A>or none at all, or accepting help from those worse off than yourself; so 
<A NAME="526"></A>also borrowing when it will seem like begging; begging when it will seem 
<A NAME="527"></A>like asking the return of a favour; asking such a return when it will seem 
<A NAME="528"></A>like begging; praising a man in order that it may seem like begging; and 
<A NAME="529"></A>going on begging in spite of failure: all such actions are tokens of meanness. 
<A NAME="530"></A>Also, praising people to their face, and praising extravagantly a man's 
<A NAME="531"></A>good points and glozing over his weaknesses, and showing extravagant sympathy 
<A NAME="532"></A>with his grief when you are in his presence, and all that sort of thing; 
<A NAME="533"></A>all this shows the disposition of a flatterer. Also, refusing to endure 
<A NAME="534"></A>hardships that are endured by people who are older, more delicately brought 
<A NAME="535"></A>up, of higher rank, or generally less capable of endurance than ourselves: 
<A NAME="536"></A>for all this shows effeminacy. Also, accepting benefits, especially accepting 
<A NAME="537"></A>them often, from another man, and then abusing him for conferring them: 
<A NAME="538"></A>all this shows a mean, ignoble disposition. Also, talking incessantly about 
<A NAME="539"></A>yourself, making loud professions, and appropriating the merits of others; 
<A NAME="540"></A>for this is due to boastfulness. The same is true of the actions due to 
<A NAME="541"></A>any of the other forms of badness of moral character, of the tokens of 
<A NAME="542"></A>such badness, &c.: they are all disgraceful and shameless. Another sort 
<A NAME="543"></A>of bad thing at which we feel shame is, lacking a share in the honourable 
<A NAME="544"></A>things shared by every one else, or by all or nearly all who are like ourselves. 
<A NAME="545"></A>By 'those like ourselves' I mean those of our own race or country or age 
<A NAME="546"></A>or family, and generally those who are on our own level. Once we are on 
<A NAME="547"></A>a level with others, it is a disgrace to be, say, less well educated than 
<A NAME="548"></A>they are; and so with other advantages: all the more so, in each case, 
<A NAME="549"></A>if it is seen to be our own fault: wherever we are ourselves to blame for 
<A NAME="550"></A>our present, past, or future circumstances, it follows at once that this 
<A NAME="551"></A>is to a greater extent due to our moral badness. We are moreover ashamed 
<A NAME="552"></A>of having done to us, having had done, or being about to have done to us 
<A NAME="553"></A>acts that involve us in dishonour and reproach; as when we surrender our 
<A NAME="554"></A>persons, or lend ourselves to vile deeds, e.g. when we submit to outrage. 
<A NAME="555"></A>And acts of yielding to the lust of others are shameful whether willing 
<A NAME="556"></A>or unwilling (yielding to force being an instance of unwillingness), since 
<A NAME="557"></A>unresisting submission to them is due to unmanliness or 
<A NAME="558"></A>cowardice.
<A NAME="559"></A><BR><BR>These things, and others like them, are what cause the feeling 
<A NAME="560"></A>of shame. Now since shame is a mental picture of disgrace, in which we 
<A NAME="561"></A>shrink from the disgrace itself and not from its consequences, and we only 
<A NAME="562"></A>care what opinion is held of us because of the people who form that opinion, 
<A NAME="563"></A>it follows that the people before whom we feel shame are those whose opinion 
<A NAME="564"></A>of us matters to us. Such persons are: those who admire us, those whom 
<A NAME="565"></A>we admire, those by whom we wish to be admired, those with whom we are 
<A NAME="566"></A>competing, and those whose opinion of us we respect. We admire those, and 
<A NAME="567"></A>wish those to admire us, who possess any good thing that is highly esteemed; 
<A NAME="568"></A>or from whom we are very anxious to get something that they are able to 
<A NAME="569"></A>give us-as a lover feels. We compete with our equals. We respect, as true, 
<A NAME="570"></A>the views of sensible people, such as our elders and those who have been 
<A NAME="571"></A>well educated. And we feel more shame about a thing if it is done openly, 
<A NAME="572"></A>before all men's eyes. Hence the proverb, 'shame dwells in the eyes'. For 
<A NAME="573"></A>this reason we feel most shame before those who will always be with us 
<A NAME="574"></A>and those who notice what we do, since in both cases eyes are upon us. 
<A NAME="575"></A>We also feel it before those not open to the same imputation as ourselves: 
<A NAME="576"></A>for it is plain that their opinions about it are the opposite of ours. 
<A NAME="577"></A>Also before those who are hard on any one whose conduct they think wrong; 
<A NAME="578"></A>for what a man does himself, he is said not to resent when his neighbours 
<A NAME="579"></A>do it: so that of course he does resent their doing what he does not do 
<A NAME="580"></A>himself. And before those who are likely to tell everybody about you; not 
<A NAME="581"></A>telling others is as good as not be lieving you wrong. People are likely 
<A NAME="582"></A>to tell others about you if you have wronged them, since they are on the 
<A NAME="583"></A>look out to harm you; or if they speak evil of everybody, for those who 
<A NAME="584"></A>attack the innocent will be still more ready to attack the guilty. And 
<A NAME="585"></A>before those whose main occupation is with their neighbours' failings-people 
<A NAME="586"></A>like satirists and writers of comedy; these are really a kind of evil-speakers 
<A NAME="587"></A>and tell-tales. And before those who have never yet known us come to grief, 
<A NAME="588"></A>since their attitude to us has amounted to admiration so far: that is why 
<A NAME="589"></A>we feel ashamed to refuse those a favour who ask one for the first time-we 
<A NAME="590"></A>have not as yet lost credit with them. Such are those who are just beginning 
<A NAME="591"></A>to wish to be our friends; for they have seen our best side only (hence 
<A NAME="592"></A>the appropriateness of Euripides' reply to the Syracusans): and such also 
<A NAME="593"></A>are those among our old acquaintances who know nothing to our discredit. 
<A NAME="594"></A>And we are ashamed not merely of the actual shameful conduct mentioned, 
<A NAME="595"></A>but also of the evidences of it: not merely, for example, of actual sexual 
<A NAME="596"></A>intercourse, but also of its evidences; and not merely of disgraceful acts 
<A NAME="597"></A>but also of disgraceful talk. Similarly we feel shame not merely in presence 
<A NAME="598"></A>of the persons mentioned but also of those who will tell them what we have 
<A NAME="599"></A>done, such as their servants or friends. And, generally, we feel no shame 
<A NAME="600"></A>before those upon whose opinions we quite look down as untrustworthy (no 
<A NAME="601"></A>one feels shame before small children or animals); nor are we ashamed of 
<A NAME="602"></A>the same things before intimates as before strangers, but before the former 
<A NAME="603"></A>of what seem genuine faults, before the latter of what seem conventional 
<A NAME="604"></A>ones.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>The conditions under which we shall feel shame are these: first, 
<A NAME="606"></A>having people related to us like those before whom, as has been said, we 
<A NAME="607"></A>feel shame. These are, as was stated, persons whom we admire, or who admire 
<A NAME="608"></A>us, or by whom we wish to be admired, or from whom we desire some service 
<A NAME="609"></A>that we shall not obtain if we forfeit their good opinion. These persons 
<A NAME="610"></A>may be actually looking on (as Cydias represented them in his speech on 
<A NAME="611"></A>land assignments in Samos, when he told the Athenians to imagine the Greeks 
<A NAME="612"></A>to be standing all around them, actually seeing the way they voted and 
<A NAME="613"></A>not merely going to hear about it afterwards): or again they may be near 
<A NAME="614"></A>at hand, or may be likely to find out about what we do. This is why in 
<A NAME="615"></A>misfortune we do not wish to be seen by those who once wished themselves 
<A NAME="616"></A>like us; for such a feeling implies admiration. And men feel shame when 
<A NAME="617"></A>they have acts or exploits to their credit on which they are bringing dishonour, 
<A NAME="618"></A>whether these are their own, or those of their ancestors, or those of other 
<A NAME="619"></A>persons with whom they have some close connexion. Generally, we feel shame 
<A NAME="620"></A>before those for whose own misconduct we should also feel it-those already 
<A NAME="621"></A>mentioned; those who take us as their models; those whose teachers or advisers 
<A NAME="622"></A>we have been; or other people, it may be, like ourselves, whose rivals 
<A NAME="623"></A>we are. For there are many things that shame before such people makes us 
<A NAME="624"></A>do or leave undone. And we feel more shame when we are likely to be continually 
<A NAME="625"></A>seen by, and go about under the eyes of, those who know of our disgrace. 
<A NAME="626"></A>Hence, when Antiphon the poet was to be cudgelled to death by order of 
<A NAME="627"></A>Dionysius, and saw those who were to perish with him covering their faces 
<A NAME="628"></A>as they went through the gates, he said, 'Why do you cover your faces? 
<A NAME="629"></A>Is it lest some of these spectators should see you to-morrow?'
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>So much for Shame; to understand Shamelessness, we need only consider 
<A NAME="631"></A>the converse cases, and plainly we shall have all we 
<A NAME="632"></A>need.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="633"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR>To take Kindness next: the definition of it will show us towards 
<A NAME="635"></A>whom it is felt, why, and in what frames of mind. Kindness-under the influence 
<A NAME="636"></A>of which a man is said to 'be kind' may be defined as helpfulness towards 
<A NAME="637"></A>some one in need, not in return for anything, nor for the advantage of 
<A NAME="638"></A>the helper himself, but for that of the person helped. Kindness is great 
<A NAME="639"></A>if shown to one who is in great need, or who needs what is important and 
<A NAME="640"></A>hard to get, or who needs it at an important and difficult crisis; or if 
<A NAME="641"></A>the helper is the only, the first, or the chief person to give the help. 
<A NAME="642"></A>Natural cravings constitute such needs; and in particular cravings, accompanied 
<A NAME="643"></A>by pain, for what is not being attained. The appetites are cravings for 
<A NAME="644"></A>this kind: sexual desire, for instance, and those which arise during bodily 
<A NAME="645"></A>injuries and in dangers; for appetite is active both in danger and in pain. 
<A NAME="646"></A>Hence those who stand by us in poverty or in banishment, even if they do 
<A NAME="647"></A>not help us much, are yet really kind to us, because our need is great 
<A NAME="648"></A>and the occasion pressing; for instance, the man who gave the mat in the 
<A NAME="649"></A>Lyceum. The helpfulness must therefore meet, preferably, just this kind 
<A NAME="650"></A>of need; and failing just this kind, some other kind as great or greater. 
<A NAME="651"></A>We now see to whom, why, and under what conditions kindness is shown; and 
<A NAME="652"></A>these facts must form the basis of our arguments. We must show that the 
<A NAME="653"></A>persons helped are, or have been, in such pain and need as has been described, 
<A NAME="654"></A>and that their helpers gave, or are giving, the kind of help described, 
<A NAME="655"></A>in the kind of need described. We can also see how to eliminate the idea 
<A NAME="656"></A>of kindness and make our opponents appear unkind: we may maintain that 
<A NAME="657"></A>they are being or have been helpful simply to promote their own interest-this, 
<A NAME="658"></A>as has been stated, is not kindness; or that their action was accidental, 
<A NAME="659"></A>or was forced upon them; or that they were not doing a favour, but merely 
<A NAME="660"></A>returning one, whether they know this or not-in either case the action 
<A NAME="661"></A>is a mere return, and is therefore not a kindness even if the doer does 
<A NAME="662"></A>not know how the case stands. In considering this subject we must look 
<A NAME="663"></A>at all the categories: an act may be an act of kindness because (1) it 
<A NAME="664"></A>is a particular thing, (2) it has a particular magnitude or (3) quality, 
<A NAME="665"></A>or (4) is done at a particular time or (5) place. As evidence of the want 
<A NAME="666"></A>of kindness, we may point out that a smaller service had been refused to 
<A NAME="667"></A>the man in need; or that the same service, or an equal or greater one, 
<A NAME="668"></A>has been given to his enemies; these facts show that the service in question 
<A NAME="669"></A>was not done for the sake of the person helped. Or we may point out that 
<A NAME="670"></A>the thing desired was worthless and that the helper knew it: no one will 
<A NAME="671"></A>admit that he is in need of what is worthless.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="672"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR>So much for Kindness and Unkindness. Let us now consider Pity, 
<A NAME="674"></A>asking ourselves what things excite pity, and for what persons, and in 
<A NAME="675"></A>what states of our mind pity is felt. Pity may be defined as a feeling 
<A NAME="676"></A>of pain caused by the sight of some evil, destructive or painful, which 
<A NAME="677"></A>befalls one who does not deserve it, and which we might expect to befall 
<A NAME="678"></A>ourselves or some friend of ours, and moreover to befall us soon. In order 
<A NAME="679"></A>to feel pity, we must obviously be capable of supposing that some evil 
<A NAME="680"></A>may happen to us or some friend of ours, and moreover some such evil as 
<A NAME="681"></A>is stated in our definition or is more or less of that kind. It is therefore 
<A NAME="682"></A>not felt by those completely ruined, who suppose that no further evil can 
<A NAME="683"></A>befall them, since the worst has befallen them already; nor by those who 
<A NAME="684"></A>imagine themselves immensely fortunate-their feeling is rather presumptuous 
<A NAME="685"></A>insolence, for when they think they possess all the good things of life, 
<A NAME="686"></A>it is clear that the impossibility of evil befalling them will be included, 
<A NAME="687"></A>this being one of the good things in question. Those who think evil may 
<A NAME="688"></A>befall them are such as have already had it befall them and have safely 
<A NAME="689"></A>escaped from it; elderly men, owing to their good sense and their experience; 
<A NAME="690"></A>weak men, especially men inclined to cowardice; and also educated people, 
<A NAME="691"></A>since these can take long views. Also those who have parents living, or 
<A NAME="692"></A>children, or wives; for these are our own, and the evils mentioned above 
<A NAME="693"></A>may easily befall them. And those who neither moved by any courageous emotion 
<A NAME="694"></A>such as anger or confidence (these emotions take no account of the future), 
<A NAME="695"></A>nor by a disposition to presumptuous insolence (insolent men, too, take 
<A NAME="696"></A>no account of the possibility that something evil will happen to them), 
<A NAME="697"></A>nor yet by great fear (panic-stricken people do not feel pity, because 
<A NAME="698"></A>they are taken up with what is happening to themselves); only those feel 
<A NAME="699"></A>pity who are between these two extremes. In order to feel pity we must 
<A NAME="700"></A>also believe in the goodness of at least some people; if you think nobody 
<A NAME="701"></A>good, you will believe that everybody deserves evil fortune. And, generally, 
<A NAME="702"></A>we feel pity whenever we are in the condition of remembering that similar 
<A NAME="703"></A>misfortunes have happened to us or ours, or expecting them to happen in 
<A NAME="704"></A>the future.
<A NAME="705"></A><BR><BR>So much for the mental conditions under which we feel pity. What 
<A NAME="706"></A>we pity is stated clearly in the definition. All unpleasant and painful 
<A NAME="707"></A>things excite pity if they tend to destroy pain and annihilate; and all 
<A NAME="708"></A>such evils as are due to chance, if they are serious. The painful and destructive 
<A NAME="709"></A>evils are: death in its various forms, bodily injuries and afflictions, 
<A NAME="710"></A>old age, diseases, lack of food. The evils due to chance are: friendlessness, 
<A NAME="711"></A>scarcity of friends (it is a pitiful thing to be torn away from friends 
<A NAME="712"></A>and companions), deformity, weakness, mutilation; evil coming from a source 
<A NAME="713"></A>from which good ought to have come; and the frequent repetition of such 
<A NAME="714"></A>misfortunes. Also the coming of good when the worst has happened: e.g. 
<A NAME="715"></A>the arrival of the Great King's gifts for Diopeithes after his death. Also 
<A NAME="716"></A>that either no good should have befallen a man at all, or that he should 
<A NAME="717"></A>not be able to enjoy it when it has.
<A NAME="718"></A><BR><BR>The grounds, then, on which we feel pity are these or like these. 
<A NAME="719"></A>The people we pity are: those whom we know, if only they are not very closely 
<A NAME="720"></A>related to us-in that case we feel about them as if we were in danger ourselves. 
<A NAME="721"></A>For this reason Amasis did not weep, they say, at the sight of his son 
<A NAME="722"></A>being led to death, but did weep when he saw his friend begging: the latter 
<A NAME="723"></A>sight was pitiful, the former terrible, and the terrible is different from 
<A NAME="724"></A>the pitiful; it tends to cast out pity, and often helps to produce the 
<A NAME="725"></A>opposite of pity. Again, we feel pity when the danger is near ourselves. 
<A NAME="726"></A>Also we pity those who are like us in age, character, disposition, social 
<A NAME="727"></A>standing, or birth; for in all these cases it appears more likely that 
<A NAME="728"></A>the same misfortune may befall us also. Here too we have to remember the 
<A NAME="729"></A>general principle that what we fear for ourselves excites our pity when 
<A NAME="730"></A>it happens to others. Further, since it is when the sufferings of others 
<A NAME="731"></A>are close to us that they excite our pity (we cannot remember what disasters 
<A NAME="732"></A>happened a hundred centuries ago, nor look forward to what will happen 
<A NAME="733"></A>a hundred centuries hereafter, and therefore feel little pity, if any, 
<A NAME="734"></A>for such things): it follows that those who heighten the effect of their 
<A NAME="735"></A>words with suitable gestures, tones, dress, and dramatic action generally, 
<A NAME="736"></A>are especially successful in exciting pity: they thus put the disasters 
<A NAME="737"></A>before our eyes, and make them seem close to us, just coming or just past. 
<A NAME="738"></A>Anything that has just happened, or is going to happen soon, is particularly 
<A NAME="739"></A>piteous: so too therefore are the tokens and the actions of sufferers-the 
<A NAME="740"></A>garments and the like of those who have already suffered; the words and 
<A NAME="741"></A>the like of those actually suffering-of those, for instance, who are on 
<A NAME="742"></A>the point of death. Most piteous of all is it when, in such times of trial, 
<A NAME="743"></A>the victims are persons of noble character: whenever they are so, our pity 
<A NAME="744"></A>is especially excited, because their innocence, as well as the setting 
<A NAME="745"></A>of their misfortunes before our eyes, makes their misfortunes seem close 
<A NAME="746"></A>to ourselves.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="747"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="748"></A><BR><BR>Most directly opposed to pity is the feeling called Indignation. 
<A NAME="749"></A>Pain at unmerited good fortune is, in one sense, opposite to pain at unmerited 
<A NAME="750"></A>bad fortune, and is due to the same moral qualities. Both feelings are 
<A NAME="751"></A>associated with good moral character; it is our duty both to feel sympathy 
<A NAME="752"></A>and pity for unmerited distress, and to feel indignation at unmerited prosperity; 
<A NAME="753"></A>for whatever is undeserved is unjust, and that is why we ascribe indignation 
<A NAME="754"></A>even to the gods. It might indeed be thought that envy is similarly opposed 
<A NAME="755"></A>to pity, on the ground that envy it closely akin to indignation, or even 
<A NAME="756"></A>the same thing. But it is not the same. It is true that it also is a disturbing 
<A NAME="757"></A>pain excited by the prosperity of others. But it is excited not by the 
<A NAME="758"></A>prosperity of the undeserving but by that of people who are like us or 
<A NAME="759"></A>equal with us. The two feelings have this in common, that they must be 
<A NAME="760"></A>due not to some untoward thing being likely to befall ourselves, but only 
<A NAME="761"></A>to what is happening to our neighbour. The feeling ceases to be envy in 
<A NAME="762"></A>the one case and indignation in the other, and becomes fear, if the pain 
<A NAME="763"></A>and disturbance are due to the prospect of something bad for ourselves 
<A NAME="764"></A>as the result of the other man's good fortune. The feelings of pity and 
<A NAME="765"></A>indignation will obviously be attended by the converse feelings of satisfaction. 
<A NAME="766"></A>If you are pained by the unmerited distress of others, you will be pleased, 
<A NAME="767"></A>or at least not pained, by their merited distress. Thus no good man can 
<A NAME="768"></A>be pained by the punishment of parricides or murderers. These are things 
<A NAME="769"></A>we are bound to rejoice at, as we must at the prosperity of the deserving; 
<A NAME="770"></A>both these things are just, and both give pleasure to any honest man, since 
<A NAME="771"></A>he cannot help expecting that what has happened to a man like him will 
<A NAME="772"></A>happen to him too. All these feelings are associated with the same type 
<A NAME="773"></A>of moral character. And their contraries are associated with the contrary 
<A NAME="774"></A>type; the man who is delighted by others' misfortunes is identical with 
<A NAME="775"></A>the man who envies others' prosperity. For any one who is pained by the 
<A NAME="776"></A>occurrence or existence of a given thing must be pleased by that thing's 
<A NAME="777"></A>non-existence or destruction. We can now see that all these feelings tend 
<A NAME="778"></A>to prevent pity (though they differ among themselves, for the reasons given), 
<A NAME="779"></A>so that all are equally useful for neutralizing an appeal to 
<A NAME="780"></A>pity.
<A NAME="781"></A><BR><BR>We will first consider Indignation-reserving the other emotions 
<A NAME="782"></A>for subsequent discussion-and ask with whom, on what grounds, and in what 
<A NAME="783"></A>states of mind we may be indignant. These questions are really answered 
<A NAME="784"></A>by what has been said already. Indignation is pain caused by the sight 
<A NAME="785"></A>of undeserved good fortune. It is, then, plain to begin with that there 
<A NAME="786"></A>are some forms of good the sight of which cannot cause it. Thus a man may 
<A NAME="787"></A>be just or brave, or acquire moral goodness: but we shall not be indignant 
<A NAME="788"></A>with him for that reason, any more than we shall pity him for the contrary 
<A NAME="789"></A>reason. Indignation is roused by the sight of wealth, power, and the like-by 
<A NAME="790"></A>all those things, roughly speaking, which are deserved by good men and 
<A NAME="791"></A>by those who possess the goods of nature-noble birth, beauty, and so on. 
<A NAME="792"></A>Again, what is long established seems akin to what exists by nature; and 
<A NAME="793"></A>therefore we feel more indignation at those possessing a given good if 
<A NAME="794"></A>they have as a matter of fact only just got it and the prosperity it brings 
<A NAME="795"></A>with it. The newly rich give more offence than those whose wealth is of 
<A NAME="796"></A>long standing and inherited. The same is true of those who have office 
<A NAME="797"></A>or power, plenty of friends, a fine family, &c. We feel the same when these 
<A NAME="798"></A>advantages of theirs secure them others. For here again, the newly rich 
<A NAME="799"></A>give us more offence by obtaining office through their riches than do those 
<A NAME="800"></A>whose wealth is of long standing; and so in all other cases. The reason 
<A NAME="801"></A>is that what the latter have is felt to be really their own, but what the 
<A NAME="802"></A>others have is not; what appears to have been always what it is is regarded 
<A NAME="803"></A>as real, and so the possessions of the newly rich do not seem to be really 
<A NAME="804"></A>their own. Further, it is not any and every man that deserves any given 
<A NAME="805"></A>kind of good; there is a certain correspondence and appropriateness in 
<A NAME="806"></A>such things; thus it is appropriate for brave men, not for just men, to 
<A NAME="807"></A>have fine weapons, and for men of family, not for parvenus, to make distinguished 
<A NAME="808"></A>marriages. Indignation may therefore properly be felt when any one gets 
<A NAME="809"></A>what is not appropriate for him, though he may be a good man enough. It 
<A NAME="810"></A>may also be felt when any one sets himself up against his superior, especially 
<A NAME="811"></A>against his superior in some particular respect-whence the lines <BR><BR>"Only 
<A NAME="812"></A>from battle he shrank with Aias Telamon's son; <BR><BR>"Zeus had been angered 
<A NAME="813"></A>with him, <BR><BR>"had he fought with a mightier one; 
<A NAME="814"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="815"></A>but also, even apart from that, when the inferior in any sense contends 
<A NAME="816"></A>with his superior; a musician, for instance, with a just man, for justice 
<A NAME="817"></A>is a finer thing than music.
<A NAME="818"></A><BR><BR>Enough has been said to make clear the grounds on which, and the 
<A NAME="819"></A>persons against whom, Indignation is felt-they are those mentioned, and 
<A NAME="820"></A>others like him. As for the people who feel it; we feel it if we do ourselves 
<A NAME="821"></A>deserve the greatest possible goods and moreover have them, for it is an 
<A NAME="822"></A>injustice that those who are not our equals should have been held to deserve 
<A NAME="823"></A>as much as we have. Or, secondly, we feel it if we are really good and 
<A NAME="824"></A>honest people; our judgement is then sound, and we loathe any kind of injustice. 
<A NAME="825"></A>Also if we are ambitious and eager to gain particular ends, especially 
<A NAME="826"></A>if we are ambitious for what others are getting without deserving to get 
<A NAME="827"></A>it. And, generally, if we think that we ourselves deserve a thing and that 
<A NAME="828"></A>others do not, we are disposed to be indignant with those others so far 
<A NAME="829"></A>as that thing is concerned. Hence servile, worthless, unambitious persons 
<A NAME="830"></A>are not inclined to Indignation, since there is nothing they can believe 
<A NAME="831"></A>themselves to deserve.
<A NAME="832"></A><BR><BR>From all this it is plain what sort of men those are at whose misfortunes, 
<A NAME="833"></A>distresses, or failures we ought to feel pleased, or at least not pained: 
<A NAME="834"></A>by considering the facts described we see at once what their contraries 
<A NAME="835"></A>are. If therefore our speech puts the judges in such a frame of mind as 
<A NAME="836"></A>that indicated and shows that those who claim pity on certain definite 
<A NAME="837"></A>grounds do not deserve to secure pity but do deserve not to secure it, 
<A NAME="838"></A>it will be impossible for the judges to feel pity.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="839"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR>To take Envy next: we can see on what grounds, against what persons, 
<A NAME="841"></A>and in what states of mind we feel it. Envy is pain at the sight of such 
<A NAME="842"></A>good fortune as consists of the good things already mentioned; we feel 
<A NAME="843"></A>it towards our equals; not with the idea of getting something for ourselves, 
<A NAME="844"></A>but because the other people have it. We shall feel it if we have, or think 
<A NAME="845"></A>we have, equals; and by 'equals' I mean equals in birth, relationship, 
<A NAME="846"></A>age, disposition, distinction, or wealth. We feel envy also if we fall 
<A NAME="847"></A>but a little short of having everything; which is why people in high place 
<A NAME="848"></A>and prosperity feel it-they think every one else is taking what belongs 
<A NAME="849"></A>to themselves. Also if we are exceptionally distinguished for some particular 
<A NAME="850"></A>thing, and especially if that thing is wisdom or good fortune. Ambitious 
<A NAME="851"></A>men are more envious than those who are not. So also those who profess 
<A NAME="852"></A>wisdom; they are ambitious to be thought wise. Indeed, generally, those 
<A NAME="853"></A>who aim at a reputation for anything are envious on this particular point. 
<A NAME="854"></A>And small-minded men are envious, for everything seems great to them. The 
<A NAME="855"></A>good things which excite envy have already been mentioned. The deeds or 
<A NAME="856"></A>possessions which arouse the love of reputation and honour and the desire 
<A NAME="857"></A>for fame, and the various gifts of fortune, are almost all subject to envy; 
<A NAME="858"></A>and particularly if we desire the thing ourselves, or think we are entitled 
<A NAME="859"></A>to it, or if having it puts us a little above others, or not having it 
<A NAME="860"></A>a little below them. It is clear also what kind of people we envy; that 
<A NAME="861"></A>was included in what has been said already: we envy those who are near 
<A NAME="862"></A>us in time, place, age, or reputation. Hence the line: <BR><BR>"Ay, kin 
<A NAME="863"></A>can even be jealous of their kin. "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="864"></A>Also our fellow-competitors, who are indeed the people just mentioned-we 
<A NAME="865"></A>do not compete with men who lived a hundred centuries ago, or those not 
<A NAME="866"></A>yet born, or the dead, or those who dwell near the Pillars of Hercules, 
<A NAME="867"></A>or those whom, in our opinion or that of others, we take to be far below 
<A NAME="868"></A>us or far above us. So too we compete with those who follow the same ends 
<A NAME="869"></A>as ourselves: we compete with our rivals in sport or in love, and generally 
<A NAME="870"></A>with those who are after the same things; and it is therefore these whom 
<A NAME="871"></A>we are bound to envy beyond all others. Hence the saying: <BR><BR>"Potter 
<A NAME="872"></A>against potter. "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="873"></A>We also envy those whose possession of or success in a thing is a reproach 
<A NAME="874"></A>to us: these are our neighbours and equals; for it is clear that it is 
<A NAME="875"></A>our own fault we have missed the good thing in question; this annoys us, 
<A NAME="876"></A>and excites envy in us. We also envy those who have what we ought to have, 
<A NAME="877"></A>or have got what we did have once. Hence old men envy younger men, and 
<A NAME="878"></A>those who have spent much envy those who have spent little on the same 
<A NAME="879"></A>thing. And men who have not got a thing, or not got it yet, envy those 
<A NAME="880"></A>who have got it quickly. We can also see what things and what persons give 
<A NAME="881"></A>pleasure to envious people, and in what states of mind they feel it: the 
<A NAME="882"></A>states of mind in which they feel pain are those under which they will 
<A NAME="883"></A>feel pleasure in the contrary things. If therefore we ourselves with whom 
<A NAME="884"></A>the decision rests are put into an envious state of mind, and those for 
<A NAME="885"></A>whom our pity, or the award of something desirable, is claimed are such 
<A NAME="886"></A>as have been described, it is obvious that they will win no pity from 
<A NAME="887"></A>us.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="888"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="889"></A><BR><BR>We will next consider Emulation, showing in what follows its causes 
<A NAME="890"></A>and objects, and the state of mind in which it is felt. Emulation is pain 
<A NAME="891"></A>caused by seeing the presence, in persons whose nature is like our own, 
<A NAME="892"></A>of good things that are highly valued and are possible for ourselves to 
<A NAME="893"></A>acquire; but it is felt not because others have these goods, but because 
<A NAME="894"></A>we have not got them ourselves. It is therefore a good feeling felt by 
<A NAME="895"></A>good persons, whereas envy is a bad feeling felt by bad persons. Emulation 
<A NAME="896"></A>makes us take steps to secure the good things in question, envy makes us 
<A NAME="897"></A>take steps to stop our neighbour having them. Emulation must therefore 
<A NAME="898"></A>tend to be felt by persons who believe themselves to deserve certain good 
<A NAME="899"></A>things that they have not got, it being understood that no one aspires 
<A NAME="900"></A>to things which appear impossible. It is accordingly felt by the young 
<A NAME="901"></A>and by persons of lofty disposition. Also by those who possess such good 
<A NAME="902"></A>things as are deserved by men held in honour-these are wealth, abundance 
<A NAME="903"></A>of friends, public office, and the like; on the assumption that they ought 
<A NAME="904"></A>to be good men, they are emulous to gain such goods because they ought, 
<A NAME="905"></A>in their belief, to belong to men whose state of mind is good. Also by 
<A NAME="906"></A>those whom all others think deserving. We also feel it about anything for 
<A NAME="907"></A>which our ancestors, relatives, personal friends, race, or country are 
<A NAME="908"></A>specially honoured, looking upon that thing as really our own, and therefore 
<A NAME="909"></A>feeling that we deserve to have it. Further, since all good things that 
<A NAME="910"></A>are highly honoured are objects of emulation, moral goodness in its various 
<A NAME="911"></A>forms must be such an object, and also all those good things that are useful 
<A NAME="912"></A>and serviceable to others: for men honour those who are morally good, and 
<A NAME="913"></A>also those who do them service. So with those good things our possession 
<A NAME="914"></A>of which can give enjoyment to our neighbours-wealth and beauty rather 
<A NAME="915"></A>than health. We can see, too, what persons are the objects of the feeling. 
<A NAME="916"></A>They are those who have these and similar things-those already mentioned, 
<A NAME="917"></A>as courage, wisdom, public office. Holders of public office-generals, orators, 
<A NAME="918"></A>and all who possess such powers-can do many people a good turn. Also those 
<A NAME="919"></A>whom many people wish to be like; those who have many acquaintances or 
<A NAME="920"></A>friends; those whom admire, or whom we ourselves admire; and those who 
<A NAME="921"></A>have been praised and eulogized by poets or prose-writers. Persons of the 
<A NAME="922"></A>contrary sort are objects of contempt: for the feeling and notion of contempt 
<A NAME="923"></A>are opposite to those of emulation. Those who are such as to emulate or 
<A NAME="924"></A>be emulated by others are inevitably disposed to be contemptuous of all 
<A NAME="925"></A>such persons as are subject to those bad things which are contrary to the 
<A NAME="926"></A>good things that are the objects of emulation: despising them for just 
<A NAME="927"></A>that reason. Hence we often despise the fortunate, when luck comes to them 
<A NAME="928"></A>without their having those good things which are held in 
<A NAME="929"></A>honour.
<A NAME="930"></A><BR><BR>This completes our discussion of the means by which the several 
<A NAME="931"></A>emotions may be produced or dissipated, and upon which depend the persuasive 
<A NAME="932"></A>arguments connected with the emotions.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="933"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR>Let us now consider the various types of human character, in relation 
<A NAME="935"></A>to the emotions and moral qualities, showing how they correspond to our 
<A NAME="936"></A>various ages and fortunes. By emotions I mean anger, desire, and the like; 
<A NAME="937"></A>these we have discussed already. By moral qualities I mean virtues and 
<A NAME="938"></A>vices; these also have been discussed already, as well as the various things 
<A NAME="939"></A>that various types of men tend to will and to do. By ages I mean youth, 
<A NAME="940"></A>the prime of life, and old age. By fortune I mean birth, wealth, power, 
<A NAME="941"></A>and their opposites-in fact, good fortune and ill fortune.
<A NAME="942"></A><BR><BR>To begin with the Youthful type of character. Young men have strong 
<A NAME="943"></A>passions, and tend to gratify them indiscriminately. Of the bodily desires, 
<A NAME="944"></A>it is the sexual by which they are most swayed and in which they show absence 
<A NAME="945"></A>of self-control. They are changeable and fickle in their desires, which 
<A NAME="946"></A>are violent while they last, but quickly over: their impulses are keen 
<A NAME="947"></A>but not deep-rooted, and are like sick people's attacks of hunger and thirst. 
<A NAME="948"></A>They are hot-tempered, and quick-tempered, and apt to give way to their 
<A NAME="949"></A>anger; bad temper often gets the better of them, for owing to their love 
<A NAME="950"></A>of honour they cannot bear being slighted, and are indignant if they imagine 
<A NAME="951"></A>themselves unfairly treated. While they love honour, they love victory 
<A NAME="952"></A>still more; for youth is eager for superiority over others, and victory 
<A NAME="953"></A>is one form of this. They love both more than they love money, which indeed 
<A NAME="954"></A>they love very little, not having yet learnt what it means to be without 
<A NAME="955"></A>it-this is the point of Pittacus' remark about Amphiaraus. They look at 
<A NAME="956"></A>the good side rather than the bad, not having yet witnessed many instances 
<A NAME="957"></A>of wickedness. They trust others readily, because they have not yet often 
<A NAME="958"></A>been cheated. They are sanguine; nature warms their blood as though with 
<A NAME="959"></A>excess of wine; and besides that, they have as yet met with few disappointments. 
<A NAME="960"></A>Their lives are mainly spent not in memory but in expectation; for expectation 
<A NAME="961"></A>refers to the future, memory to the past, and youth has a long future before 
<A NAME="962"></A>it and a short past behind it: on the first day of one's life one has nothing 
<A NAME="963"></A>at all to remember, and can only look forward. They are easily cheated, 
<A NAME="964"></A>owing to the sanguine disposition just mentioned. Their hot tempers and 
<A NAME="965"></A>hopeful dispositions make them more courageous than older men are; the 
<A NAME="966"></A>hot temper prevents fear, and the hopeful disposition creates confidence; 
<A NAME="967"></A>we cannot feel fear so long as we are feeling angry, and any expectation 
<A NAME="968"></A>of good makes us confident. They are shy, accepting the rules of society 
<A NAME="969"></A>in which they have been trained, and not yet believing in any other standard 
<A NAME="970"></A>of honour. They have exalted notions, because they have not yet been humbled 
<A NAME="971"></A>by life or learnt its necessary limitations; moreover, their hopeful disposition 
<A NAME="972"></A>makes them think themselves equal to great things-and that means having 
<A NAME="973"></A>exalted notions. They would always rather do noble deeds than useful ones: 
<A NAME="974"></A>their lives are regulated more by moral feeling than by reasoning; and 
<A NAME="975"></A>whereas reasoning leads us to choose what is useful, moral goodness leads 
<A NAME="976"></A>us to choose what is noble. They are fonder of their friends, intimates, 
<A NAME="977"></A>and companions than older men are, because they like spending their days 
<A NAME="978"></A>in the company of others, and have not yet come to value either their friends 
<A NAME="979"></A>or anything else by their usefulness to themselves. All their mistakes 
<A NAME="980"></A>are in the direction of doing things excessively and vehemently. They disobey 
<A NAME="981"></A>Chilon's precept by overdoing everything, they love too much and hate too 
<A NAME="982"></A>much, and the same thing with everything else. They think they know everything, 
<A NAME="983"></A>and are always quite sure about it; this, in fact, is why they overdo everything. 
<A NAME="984"></A>If they do wrong to others, it is because they mean to insult them, not 
<A NAME="985"></A>to do them actual harm. They are ready to pity others, because they think 
<A NAME="986"></A>every one an honest man, or anyhow better than he is: they judge their 
<A NAME="987"></A>neighbour by their own harmless natures, and so cannot think he deserves 
<A NAME="988"></A>to be treated in that way. They are fond of fun and therefore witty, wit 
<A NAME="989"></A>being well-bred insolence.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="990"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="991"></A><BR><BR>Such, then is the character of the Young. The character of Elderly 
<A NAME="992"></A>Men-men who are past their prime-may be said to be formed for the most 
<A NAME="993"></A>part of elements that are the contrary of all these. They have lived many 
<A NAME="994"></A>years; they have often been taken in, and often made mistakes; and life 
<A NAME="995"></A>on the whole is a bad business. The result is that they are sure about 
<A NAME="996"></A>nothing and under-do everything. They 'think', but they never 'know'; and 
<A NAME="997"></A>because of their hesitation they always add a 'possibly'or a 'perhaps', 
<A NAME="998"></A>putting everything this way and nothing positively. They are cynical; that 
<A NAME="999"></A>is, they tend to put the worse construction on everything. Further, their 
<A NAME="1000"></A>experience makes them distrustful and therefore suspicious of evil. Consequently 
<A NAME="1001"></A>they neither love warmly nor hate bitterly, but following the hint of Bias 
<A NAME="1002"></A>they love as though they will some day hate and hate as though they will 
<A NAME="1003"></A>some day love. They are small-minded, because they have been humbled by 
<A NAME="1004"></A>life: their desires are set upon nothing more exalted or unusual than what 
<A NAME="1005"></A>will help them to keep alive. They are not generous, because money is one 
<A NAME="1006"></A>of the things they must have, and at the same time their experience has 
<A NAME="1007"></A>taught them how hard it is to get and how easy to lose. They are cowardly, 
<A NAME="1008"></A>and are always anticipating danger; unlike that of the young, who are warm-blooded, 
<A NAME="1009"></A>their temperament is chilly; old age has paved the way for cowardice; fear 
<A NAME="1010"></A>is, in fact, a form of chill. They love life; and all the more when their 
<A NAME="1011"></A>last day has come, because the object of all desire is something we have 
<A NAME="1012"></A>not got, and also because we desire most strongly that which we need most 
<A NAME="1013"></A>urgently. They are too fond of themselves; this is one form that small-mindedness 
<A NAME="1014"></A>takes. Because of this, they guide their lives too much by considerations 
<A NAME="1015"></A>of what is useful and too little by what is noble-for the useful is what 
<A NAME="1016"></A>is good for oneself, and the noble what is good absolutely. They are not 
<A NAME="1017"></A>shy, but shameless rather; caring less for what is noble than for what 
<A NAME="1018"></A>is useful, they feel contempt for what people may think of them. They lack 
<A NAME="1019"></A>confidence in the future; partly through experience-for most things go 
<A NAME="1020"></A>wrong, or anyhow turn out worse than one expects; and partly because of 
<A NAME="1021"></A>their cowardice. They live by memory rather than by hope; for what is left 
<A NAME="1022"></A>to them of life is but little as compared with the long past; and hope 
<A NAME="1023"></A>is of the future, memory of the past. This, again, is the cause of their 
<A NAME="1024"></A>loquacity; they are continually talking of the past, because they enjoy 
<A NAME="1025"></A>remembering it. Their fits of anger are sudden but feeble. Their sensual 
<A NAME="1026"></A>passions have either altogether gone or have lost their vigour: consequently 
<A NAME="1027"></A>they do not feel their passions much, and their actions are inspired less 
<A NAME="1028"></A>by what they do feel than by the love of gain. Hence men at this time of 
<A NAME="1029"></A>life are often supposed to have a self-controlled character; the fact is 
<A NAME="1030"></A>that their passions have slackened, and they are slaves to the love of 
<A NAME="1031"></A>gain. They guide their lives by reasoning more than by moral feeling; reasoning 
<A NAME="1032"></A>being directed to utility and moral feeling to moral goodness. If they 
<A NAME="1033"></A>wrong others, they mean to injure them, not to insult them. Old men may 
<A NAME="1034"></A>feel pity, as well as young men, but not for the same reason. Young men 
<A NAME="1035"></A>feel it out of kindness; old men out of weakness, imagining that anything 
<A NAME="1036"></A>that befalls any one else might easily happen to them, which, as we saw, 
<A NAME="1037"></A>is a thought that excites pity. Hence they are querulous, and not disposed 
<A NAME="1038"></A>to jesting or laughter-the love of laughter being the very opposite of 
<A NAME="1039"></A>querulousness.
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR><BR>Such are the characters of Young Men and Elderly Men. People always 
<A NAME="1041"></A>think well of speeches adapted to, and reflecting, their own character: 
<A NAME="1042"></A>and we can now see how to compose our speeches so as to adapt both them 
<A NAME="1043"></A>and ourselves to our audiences.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1044"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="1045"></A><BR><BR>As for Men in their Prime, clearly we shall find that they have 
<A NAME="1046"></A>a character between that of the young and that of the old, free from the 
<A NAME="1047"></A>extremes of either. They have neither that excess of confidence which amounts 
<A NAME="1048"></A>to rashness, nor too much timidity, but the right amount of each. They 
<A NAME="1049"></A>neither trust everybody nor distrust everybody, but judge people correctly. 
<A NAME="1050"></A>Their lives will be guided not by the sole consideration either of what 
<A NAME="1051"></A>is noble or of what is useful, but by both; neither by parsimony nor by 
<A NAME="1052"></A>prodigality, but by what is fit and proper. So, too, in regard to anger 
<A NAME="1053"></A>and desire; they will be brave as well as temperate, and temperate as well 
<A NAME="1054"></A>as brave; these virtues are divided between the young and the old; the 
<A NAME="1055"></A>young are brave but intemperate, the old temperate but cowardly. To put 
<A NAME="1056"></A>it generally, all the valuable qualities that youth and age divide between 
<A NAME="1057"></A>them are united in the prime of life, while all their excesses or defects 
<A NAME="1058"></A>are replaced by moderation and fitness. The body is in its prime from thirty 
<A NAME="1059"></A>to five-and-thirty; the mind about forty-nine.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1060"></A><B>Part 15</B>

<A NAME="1061"></A><BR><BR>So much for the types of character that distinguish youth, old 
<A NAME="1062"></A>age, and the prime of life. We will now turn to those Gifts of Fortune 
<A NAME="1063"></A>by which human character is affected. First let us consider Good Birth. 
<A NAME="1064"></A>Its effect on character is to make those who have it more ambitious; it 
<A NAME="1065"></A>is the way of all men who have something to start with to add to the pile, 
<A NAME="1066"></A>and good birth implies ancestral distinction. The well-born man will look 
<A NAME="1067"></A>down even on those who are as good as his own ancestors, because any far-off 
<A NAME="1068"></A>distinction is greater than the same thing close to us, and better to boast 
<A NAME="1069"></A>about. Being well-born, which means coming of a fine stock, must be distinguished 
<A NAME="1070"></A>from nobility, which means being true to the family nature-a quality not 
<A NAME="1071"></A>usually found in the well-born, most of whom are poor creatures. In the 
<A NAME="1072"></A>generations of men as in the fruits of the earth, there is a varying yield; 
<A NAME="1073"></A>now and then, where the stock is good, exceptional men are produced for 
<A NAME="1074"></A>a while, and then decadence sets in. A clever stock will degenerate towards 
<A NAME="1075"></A>the insane type of character, like the descendants of Alcibiades or of 
<A NAME="1076"></A>the elder Dionysius; a steady stock towards the fatuous and torpid type, 
<A NAME="1077"></A>like the descendants of Cimon, Pericles, and Socrates.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1078"></A><B>Part 16</B>

<A NAME="1079"></A><BR><BR>The type of character produced by Wealth lies on the surface for 
<A NAME="1080"></A>all to see. Wealthy men are insolent and arrogant; their possession of 
<A NAME="1081"></A>wealth affects their understanding; they feel as if they had every good 
<A NAME="1082"></A>thing that exists; wealth becomes a sort of standard of value for everything 
<A NAME="1083"></A>else, and th
