<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 23</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>So far, then, had the city progressed by this time, growing gradually with 
<A NAME="12"></A>the growth of the democracy; but after the Persian wars the Council of 
<A NAME="13"></A>Areopagus once more developed strength and assumed the control of the state. 
<A NAME="14"></A>It did not acquire this supremacy by virtue of any formal decree, but because 
<A NAME="15"></A>it had been the cause of the battle of Salamis being fought. When the generals 
<A NAME="16"></A>were utterly at a loss how to meet the crisis and made proclamation that 
<A NAME="17"></A>every one should see to his own safety, the Areopagus provided a donation 
<A NAME="18"></A>of money, distributing eight drachmas to each member of the ships' crews, 
<A NAME="19"></A>and so prevailed on them to go on board. On these grounds people bowed 
<A NAME="20"></A>to its prestige; and during this period Athens was well administered. At 
<A NAME="21"></A>this time they devoted themselves to the prosecution of the war and were 
<A NAME="22"></A>in high repute among the Greeks, so that the command by sea was conferred 
<A NAME="23"></A>upon them, in spite of the opposition of the Lacedaemonians. The leaders 
<A NAME="24"></A>of the people during this period were Aristides, of Lysimachus, and Themistocles, 
<A NAME="25"></A>son of Lysimachus, and Themistocles, son of Neocles, of whom the latter 
<A NAME="26"></A>appeared to devote himself to the conduct of war, while the former had 
<A NAME="27"></A>the reputation of being a clever statesman and the most upright man of 
<A NAME="28"></A>his time. Accordingly the one was usually employed as general, the other 
<A NAME="29"></A>as political adviser. The rebuilding of the fortifications they conducted 
<A NAME="30"></A>in combination, although they were political opponents; but it was Aristides 
<A NAME="31"></A>who, seizing the opportunity afforded by the discredit brought upon the 
<A NAME="32"></A>Lacedaemonians by Pausanias, guided the public policy in the matter of 
<A NAME="33"></A>the defection of the Ionian states from the alliance with Sparta. It follows 
<A NAME="34"></A>that it was he who made the first assessment of tribute from the various 
<A NAME="35"></A>allied states, two years after the battle of Salamis, in the archonship 
<A NAME="36"></A>of Timosthenes; and it was he who took the oath of offensive and defensive 
<A NAME="37"></A>alliance with the Ionians, on which occasion they cast the masses of iron 
<A NAME="38"></A>into the sea.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="39"></A><B>Part 24</B>

<A NAME="40"></A><BR><BR>After this, seeing the state growing in confidence and much wealth 
<A NAME="41"></A>accumulated, he advised the people to lay hold of the leadership of the 
<A NAME="42"></A>league, and to quit the country districts and settle in the city. He pointed 
<A NAME="43"></A>out to them that all would be able to gain a living there, some by service 
<A NAME="44"></A>in the army, others in the garrisons, others by taking a part in public 
<A NAME="45"></A>affairs; and in this way they would secure the leadership. This advice 
<A NAME="46"></A>was taken; and when the people had assumed the supreme control they proceeded 
<A NAME="47"></A>to treat their allies in a more imperious fashion, with the exception of 
<A NAME="48"></A>the Chians, Lesbians, and Samians. These they maintained to protect their 
<A NAME="49"></A>empire, leaving their constitutions untouched, and allowing them to retain 
<A NAME="50"></A>whatever dominion they then possessed. They also secured an ample maintenance 
<A NAME="51"></A>for the mass of the population in the way which Aristides had pointed out 
<A NAME="52"></A>to them. Out of the proceeds of the tributes and the taxes and the contributions 
<A NAME="53"></A>of the allies more than twenty thousand persons were maintained. There 
<A NAME="54"></A>were 6,000 jurymen, 1,600 bowmen, 1,200 Knights, 500 members of the Council, 
<A NAME="55"></A>500 guards of the dockyards, besides fifty guards in the Acropolis. There 
<A NAME="56"></A>were some 700 magistrates at home, and some 700 abroad. Further, when they 
<A NAME="57"></A>subsequently went to war, there were in addition 2,500 heavy-armed troops, 
<A NAME="58"></A>twenty guard-ships, and other ships which collected the tributes, with 
<A NAME="59"></A>crews amounting to 2,000 men, selected by lot; and besides these there 
<A NAME="60"></A>were the persons maintained at the Prytaneum, and orphans, and gaolers, 
<A NAME="61"></A>since all these were supported by the state.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="62"></A><B>Part 25</B>

<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>Such was the way in which the people earned their livelihood. The 
<A NAME="64"></A>supremacy of the Areopagus lasted for about seventeen years after the Persian 
<A NAME="65"></A>wars, although gradually declining. But as the strength of the masses increased, 
<A NAME="66"></A>Ephialtes, son of Sophonides, a man with a reputation for incorruptibility 
<A NAME="67"></A>and public virtue, who had become the leader of the people, made an attack 
<A NAME="68"></A>upon that Council. First of all he ruined many of its members by bringing 
<A NAME="69"></A>actions against them with reference to their administration. Then, in the 
<A NAME="70"></A>archonship of Conon, he stripped the Council of all the acquired prerogatives 
<A NAME="71"></A>from which it derived its guardianship of the constitution, and assigned 
<A NAME="72"></A>some of them to the Council of Five Hundred, and others to the Assembly 
<A NAME="73"></A>and the law-courts. In this revolution he was assisted by Themistocles, 
<A NAME="74"></A>who was himself a member of the Areopagus, but was expecting to be tried 
<A NAME="75"></A>before it on a charge of treasonable dealings with Persia. This made him 
<A NAME="76"></A>anxious that it should be overthrown, and accordingly he warned Ephialtes 
<A NAME="77"></A>that the Council intended to arrest him, while at the same time he informed 
<A NAME="78"></A>the Areopagites that he would reveal to them certain persons who were conspiring 
<A NAME="79"></A>to subvert the constitution. He then conducted the representatives delegated 
<A NAME="80"></A>by the Council to the residence of Ephialtes, promising to show them the 
<A NAME="81"></A>conspirators who assembled there, and proceeded to converse with them in 
<A NAME="82"></A>an earnest manner. Ephialtes, seeing this, was seized with alarm and took 
<A NAME="83"></A>refuge in suppliant guise at the altar. Every one was astounded at the 
<A NAME="84"></A>occurrence, and presently, when the Council of Five Hundred met, Ephialtes 
<A NAME="85"></A>and Themistocles together proceeded to denounce the Areopagus to them. 
<A NAME="86"></A>This they repeated in similar fashion in the Assembly, until they succeeded 
<A NAME="87"></A>in depriving it of its power. Not long afterwards, however, Ephialtes was 
<A NAME="88"></A>assassinated by Aristodicus of Tanagra. In this way was the Council of 
<A NAME="89"></A>Areopagus deprived of its guardianship of the state.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="90"></A><B>Part 26</B>

<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>After this revolution the administration of the state became more 
<A NAME="92"></A>and more lax, in consequence of the eager rivalry of candidates for popular 
<A NAME="93"></A>favour. During this period the moderate party, as it happened, had no real 
<A NAME="94"></A>chief, their leader being Cimon son of Miltiades, who was a comparatively 
<A NAME="95"></A>young man, and had been late in entering public life; and at the same time 
<A NAME="96"></A>the general populace suffered great losses by war. The soldiers for active 
<A NAME="97"></A>service were selected at that time from the roll of citizens, and as the 
<A NAME="98"></A>generals were men of no military experience, who owed their position solely 
<A NAME="99"></A>to their family standing, it continually happened that some two or three 
<A NAME="100"></A>thousand of the troops perished on an expedition; and in this way the best 
<A NAME="101"></A>men alike of the lower and the upper classes were exhausted. Consequently 
<A NAME="102"></A>in most matters of administration less heed was paid to the laws than had 
<A NAME="103"></A>formerly been the case. No alteration, however, was made in the method 
<A NAME="104"></A>of election of the nine Archons, except that five years after the death 
<A NAME="105"></A>of Ephialtes it was decided that the candidates to be submitted to the 
<A NAME="106"></A>lot for that office might be selected from the Zeugitae as well as from 
<A NAME="107"></A>the higher classes. The first Archon from that class was Mnesitheides. 
<A NAME="108"></A>Up to this time all the Archons had been taken from the Pentacosiomedimni 
<A NAME="109"></A>and Knights, while the Zeugitae were confined to the ordinary magistracies, 
<A NAME="110"></A>save where an evasion of the law was overlooked. Four years later, in the 
<A NAME="111"></A>archonship of Lysicrates, thirty 'local justices', as they as they were 
<A NAME="112"></A>called, were re-established; and two years afterwards, in the archonship 
<A NAME="113"></A>of Antidotus, consequence of the great increase in the number of citizens, 
<A NAME="114"></A>it was resolved, on the motion of Pericles, that no one should admitted 
<A NAME="115"></A>to the franchise who was not of citizen birth by both 
<A NAME="116"></A>parents.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="117"></A><B>Part 27</B>

<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>After this Pericles came forward as popular leader, having first 
<A NAME="119"></A>distinguished himself while still a young man by prosecuting Cimon on the 
<A NAME="120"></A>audit of his official accounts as general. Under his auspices the constitution 
<A NAME="121"></A>became still more democratic. He took away some of the privileges of the 
<A NAME="122"></A>Areopagus, and, above all, he turned the policy of the state in the direction 
<A NAME="123"></A>of sea power, which caused the masses to acquire confidence in themselves 
<A NAME="124"></A>and consequently to take the conduct of affairs more and more into their 
<A NAME="125"></A>own hands. Moreover, forty-eight years after the battle of Salamis, in 
<A NAME="126"></A>the archonship of Pythodorus, the Peloponnesian war broke out, during which 
<A NAME="127"></A>the populace was shut up in the city and became accustomed to gain its 
<A NAME="128"></A>livelihood by military service, and so, partly voluntarily and partly involuntarily, 
<A NAME="129"></A>determined to assume the administration of the state itself. Pericles was 
<A NAME="130"></A>also the first to institute pay for service in the law-courts, as a bid 
<A NAME="131"></A>for popular favour to counterbalance the wealth of Cimon. The latter, having 
<A NAME="132"></A>private possessions on a regal scale, not only performed the regular public 
<A NAME="133"></A>services magnificently, but also maintained a large number of his fellow-demesmen. 
<A NAME="134"></A>Any member of the deme of Laciadae could go every day to Cimon's house 
<A NAME="135"></A>and there receive a reasonable provision; while his estate was guarded 
<A NAME="136"></A>by no fences, so that any one who liked might help himself to the fruit 
<A NAME="137"></A>from it. Pericles' private property was quite unequal to this magnificence 
<A NAME="138"></A>and accordingly he took the advice of Damonides of Oia (who was commonly 
<A NAME="139"></A>supposed to be the person who prompted Pericles in most of his measures, 
<A NAME="140"></A>and was therefore subsequently ostracized), which was that, as he was beaten 
<A NAME="141"></A>in the matter of private possessions, he should make gifts to the people 
<A NAME="142"></A>from their own property; and accordingly he instituted pay for the members 
<A NAME="143"></A>of the juries. Some critics accuse him of thereby causing a deterioration 
<A NAME="144"></A>in the character of the juries, since it was always the common people who 
<A NAME="145"></A>put themselves forward for selection as jurors, rather than the men of 
<A NAME="146"></A>better position. Moreover, bribery came into existence after this, the 
<A NAME="147"></A>first person to introduce it being Anytus, after his command at Pylos. 
<A NAME="148"></A>He was prosecuted by certain individuals on account of his loss of Pylos, 
<A NAME="149"></A>but escaped by bribing the jury.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="150"></A><B>Part 28</B>

<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>So long, however, as Pericles was leader of the people, things 
<A NAME="152"></A>went tolerably well with the state; but when he was dead there was a great 
<A NAME="153"></A>change for the worse. Then for the first time did the people choose a leader 
<A NAME="154"></A>who was of no reputation among men of good standing, whereas up to this 
<A NAME="155"></A>time such men had always been found as leaders of the democracy. The first 
<A NAME="156"></A>leader of the people, in the very beginning of things, was Solon, and the 
<A NAME="157"></A>second was Pisistratus, both of them men of birth and position. After the 
<A NAME="158"></A>overthrow of the tyrants there was Cleisthenes, a member of the house of 
<A NAME="159"></A>the Alcmeonidae; and he had no rival opposed to him after the expulsion 
<A NAME="160"></A>of the party of Isagoras. After this Xanthippus was the leader of the people, 
<A NAME="161"></A>and Miltiades of the upper class. Then came Themistocles and Aristides, 
<A NAME="162"></A>and after them Ephialtes as leader of the people, and Cimon son of Miltiades 
<A NAME="163"></A>of the wealthier class. Pericles followed as leader of the people, and 
<A NAME="164"></A>Thucydides, who was connected by marriage with Cimon, of the opposition. 
<A NAME="165"></A>After the death of Pericles, Nicias, who subsequently fell in Sicily, appeared 
<A NAME="166"></A>as leader of the aristocracy, and Cleon son of Cleaenetus of the people. 
<A NAME="167"></A>The latter seems, more than any one else, to have been the cause of the 
<A NAME="168"></A>corruption of the democracy by his wild undertakings; and he was the first 
<A NAME="169"></A>to use unseemly shouting and coarse abuse on the Bema, and to harangue 
<A NAME="170"></A>the people with his cloak girt up short about him, whereas all his predecessors 
<A NAME="171"></A>had spoken decently and in order. These were succeeded by Theramenes son 
<A NAME="172"></A>of Hagnon as leader of the one party, and the lyre-maker Cleophon of the 
<A NAME="173"></A>people. It was Cleophon who first granted the twoobol donation for the 
<A NAME="174"></A>theatrical performances, and for some time it continued to be given; but 
<A NAME="175"></A>then Callicrates of Paeania ousted him by promising to add a third obol 
<A NAME="176"></A>to the sum. Both of these persons were subsequently condemned to death; 
<A NAME="177"></A>for the people, even if they are deceived for a time, in the end generally 
<A NAME="178"></A>come to detest those who have beguiled them into any unworthy action. After 
<A NAME="179"></A>Cleophon the popular leadership was occupied successively by the men who 
<A NAME="180"></A>chose to talk the biggest and pander the most to the tastes of the majority, 
<A NAME="181"></A>with their eyes fixed only on the interests of the moment. The best statesmen 
<A NAME="182"></A>at Athens, after those of early times, seem to have been Nicias, Thucydides, 
<A NAME="183"></A>and Theramenes. As to Nicias and Thucydides, nearly every one agrees that 
<A NAME="184"></A>they were not merely men of birth and character, but also statesmen, and 
<A NAME="185"></A>that they ruled the state with paternal care. On the merits of Theramenes 
<A NAME="186"></A>opinion is divided, because it so happened that in his time public affairs 
<A NAME="187"></A>were in a very stormy state. But those who give their opinion deliberately 
<A NAME="188"></A>find him, not, as his critics falsely assert, overthrowing every kind of 
<A NAME="189"></A>constitution, but supporting every kind so long as it did not transgress 
<A NAME="190"></A>laws; thus showing that he was able, as every good citizen should be, to 
<A NAME="191"></A>live under any form of constitution, while he refused to countenance illegality 
<A NAME="192"></A>and was its constant enemy.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="193"></A><B>Part 29</B>

<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>So long as the fortune of the war continued even, the Athenians 
<A NAME="195"></A>preserved the democracy; but after the disaster in Sicily, when the Lacedaemonians 
<A NAME="196"></A>had gained the upper hand through their alliance with the king of Persia, 
<A NAME="197"></A>they were compelled to abolish the democracy and establish in its place 
<A NAME="198"></A>the constitution of the Four Hundred. The speech recommending this course 
<A NAME="199"></A>before the vote was made by Melobius, and the motion was proposed by Pythodorus 
<A NAME="200"></A>of Anaphlystus; but the real argument which persuaded the majority was 
<A NAME="201"></A>the belief that the king of Persia was more likely to form an alliance 
<A NAME="202"></A>with them if the constitution were on an oligarchical basis. The motion 
<A NAME="203"></A>of Pythodorus was to the following effect. The popular Assembly was to 
<A NAME="204"></A>elect twenty persons, over forty years of age, who, in conjunction with 
<A NAME="205"></A>the existing ten members of the Committee of Public Safety, after taking 
<A NAME="206"></A>an oath that they would frame such measures as they thought best for the 
<A NAME="207"></A>state, should then prepare proposals for the public. safety. In addition, 
<A NAME="208"></A>any other person might make proposals, so that of all the schemes before 
<A NAME="209"></A>them the people might choose the best. Cleitophon concurred with the motion 
<A NAME="210"></A>of Pythodorus, but moved that the committee should also investigate the 
<A NAME="211"></A>ancient laws enacted by Cleisthenes when he created the democracy, in order 
<A NAME="212"></A>that they might have these too before them and so be in a position to decide 
<A NAME="213"></A>wisely; his suggestion being that the constitution of Cleisthenes was not 
<A NAME="214"></A>really democratic, but closely akin to that of Solon. When the committee 
<A NAME="215"></A>was elected, their first proposal was that the Prytanes should be compelled 
<A NAME="216"></A>to put to the vote any motion that was offered on behalf of the public 
<A NAME="217"></A>safety. Next they abolished all indictments for illegal proposals, all 
<A NAME="218"></A>impeachments and pubic prosecutions, in order that every Athenian should 
<A NAME="219"></A>be free to give his counsel on the situation, if he chose; and they decreed 
<A NAME="220"></A>that if any person imposed a fine on any other for his acts in this respect, 
<A NAME="221"></A>or prosecuted him or summoned him before the courts, he should, on an information 
<A NAME="222"></A>being laid against him, be summarily arrested and brought before the generals, 
<A NAME="223"></A>who should deliver him to the Eleven to be put to death. After these preliminary 
<A NAME="224"></A>measures, they drew up the constitution in the following manner. The revenues 
<A NAME="225"></A>of the state were not to be spent on any purpose except the war. All magistrates 
<A NAME="226"></A>should serve without remuneration for the period of the war, except the 
<A NAME="227"></A>nine Archons and the Prytanes for the time being, who should each receive 
<A NAME="228"></A>three obols a day. The whole of the rest of the administration was to be 
<A NAME="229"></A>committed, for the period of the war, to those Athenians who were most 
<A NAME="230"></A>capable of serving the state personally or pecuniarily, to the number of 
<A NAME="231"></A>not less than five thousand. This body was to have full powers, to the 
<A NAME="232"></A>extent even of making treaties with whomsoever they willed; and ten representatives, 
<A NAME="233"></A>over forty years of age, were to be elected from each tribe to draw up 
<A NAME="234"></A>the list of the Five Thousand, after taking an oath on a full and perfect 
<A NAME="235"></A>sacrifice.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="236"></A><B>Part 30</B>

<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>These were the recommendations of the committee; and when they 
<A NAME="238"></A>had been ratified the Five Thousand elected from their own number a hundred 
<A NAME="239"></A>commissioners to draw up the constitution. They, on their appointment, 
<A NAME="240"></A>drew up and produced the following recommendations. There should be a Council, 
<A NAME="241"></A>holding office for a year, consisting of men over thirty years of age, 
<A NAME="242"></A>serving without pay. To this body should belong the Generals, the nine 
<A NAME="243"></A>Archons, the Amphictyonic Registrar (Hieromnemon), the Taxiarchs, the Hipparchs, 
<A NAME="244"></A>the Phylarch, the commanders of garrisons, the Treasurers of Athena and 
<A NAME="245"></A>the other gods, ten in number, the Hellenic Treasurers (Hellenotamiae), 
<A NAME="246"></A>the Treasurers of the other non-sacred moneys, to the number of twenty, 
<A NAME="247"></A>the ten Commissioners of Sacrifices (Hieropoei), and the ten Superintendents 
<A NAME="248"></A>of the mysteries. All these were to be appointed by the Council from a 
<A NAME="249"></A>larger number of selected candidates, chosen from its members for the time 
<A NAME="250"></A>being. The other offices were all to be filled by lot, and not from the 
<A NAME="251"></A>members of the Council. The Hellenic Treasurers who actually administered 
<A NAME="252"></A>the funds should not sit with the Council. As regards the future, four 
<A NAME="253"></A>Councils were to be created, of men of the age already mentioned, and one 
<A NAME="254"></A>of these was to be chosen by lot to take office at once, while the others 
<A NAME="255"></A>were to receive it in turn, in the order decided by the lot. For this purpose 
<A NAME="256"></A>the hundred commissioners were to distribute themselves and all the rest 
<A NAME="257"></A>as equally as possible into four parts, and cast lots for precedence, and 
<A NAME="258"></A>the selected body should hold office for a year. They were to administer 
<A NAME="259"></A>that office as seemed to them best, both with reference to the safe custody 
<A NAME="260"></A>and due expenditure of the finances, and generally with regard to all other 
<A NAME="261"></A>matters to the best of their ability. If they desired to take a larger 
<A NAME="262"></A>number of persons into counsel, each member might call in one assistant 
<A NAME="263"></A>of his own choice, subject to the same qualification of age. The Council 
<A NAME="264"></A>was to sit once every five days, unless there was any special need for 
<A NAME="265"></A>more frequent sittings. The casting of the lot for the Council was to be 
<A NAME="266"></A>held by the nine Archons; votes on divisions were to be counted by five 
<A NAME="267"></A>tellers chosen by lot from the members of the Council, and of these one 
<A NAME="268"></A>was to be selected by lot every day to act as president. These five persons 
<A NAME="269"></A>were to cast lots for precedence between the parties wishing to appear 
<A NAME="270"></A>before the Council, giving the first place to sacred matters, the second 
<A NAME="271"></A>to heralds, the third to embassies, and the fourth to all other subjects; 
<A NAME="272"></A>but matters concerning the war might be dealt with, on the motion of the 
<A NAME="273"></A>generals, whenever there was need, without balloting. Any member of the 
<A NAME="274"></A>Council who did not enter the Council-house at the time named should be 
<A NAME="275"></A>fined a drachma for each day, unless he was away on leave of absence from 
<A NAME="276"></A>the Council.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="277"></A><B>Part 31</B>

<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>Such was the constitution which they drew up for the time to come, 
<A NAME="279"></A>but for the immediate present they devised the following scheme. There 
<A NAME="280"></A>should be a Council of Four Hundred, as in the ancient constitution, forty 
<A NAME="281"></A>from each tribe, chosen out of candidates of more than thirty years of 
<A NAME="282"></A>age, selected by the members of the tribes. This Council should appoint 
<A NAME="283"></A>the magistrates and draw up the form of oath which they were to take; and 
<A NAME="284"></A>in all that concerned the laws, in the examination of official accounts, 
<A NAME="285"></A>and in other matters generally, they might act according to their discretion. 
<A NAME="286"></A>They must, however, observe the laws that might be enacted with reference 
<A NAME="287"></A>to the constitution of the state, and had no power to alter them nor to 
<A NAME="288"></A>pass others. The generals should be provisionally elected from the whole 
<A NAME="289"></A>body of the Five Thousand, but so soon as the Council came into existence 
<A NAME="290"></A>it was to hold an examination of military equipments, and thereon elect 
<A NAME="291"></A>ten persons, together with a secretary, and the persons thus elected should 
<A NAME="292"></A>hold office during the coming year with full powers, and should have the 
<A NAME="293"></A>right, whenever they desired it, of joining in the deliberations of the 
<A NAME="294"></A>Council. The Five thousand was also to elect a single Hipparch and ten 
<A NAME="295"></A>Phylarchs; but for the future the Council was to elect these officers according 
<A NAME="296"></A>to the regulations above laid down. No office, except those of member of 
<A NAME="297"></A>the Council and of general, might be held more than once, either by the 
<A NAME="298"></A>first occupants or by their successors. With reference to the future distribution 
<A NAME="299"></A>of the Four Hundred into the four successive sections, the hundred commissioners 
<A NAME="300"></A>must divide them whenever the time comes for the citizens to join in the 
<A NAME="301"></A>Council along with the rest.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="302"></A><B>Part 32</B>

<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>The hundred commissioners appointed by the Five Thousand drew up 
<A NAME="304"></A>the constitution as just stated; and after it had been ratified by the 
<A NAME="305"></A>people, under the presidency of Aristomachus, the existing Council, that 
<A NAME="306"></A>of the year of Callias, was dissolved before it had completed its term 
<A NAME="307"></A>of office. It was dissolved on the fourteenth day of the month Thargelion, 
<A NAME="308"></A>and the Four Hundred entered into office on the twenty-first; whereas the 
<A NAME="309"></A>regular Council, elected by lot, ought to have entered into office on the 
<A NAME="310"></A>fourteenth of Scirophorion. Thus was the oligarchy established, in the 
<A NAME="311"></A>archonship of Callias, just about a hundred years after the expulsion of 
<A NAME="312"></A>the tyrants. The chief promoters of the revolution were Pisander, Antiphon, 
<A NAME="313"></A>and Theramenes, all of them men of good birth and with high reputations 
<A NAME="314"></A>for ability and judgement. When, however, this constitution had been established, 
<A NAME="315"></A>the Five Thousand were only nominally selected, and the Four Hundred, together 
<A NAME="316"></A>with the ten officers on whom full powers had been conferred, occupied 
<A NAME="317"></A>the Council-house and really administered the government. They began by 
<A NAME="318"></A>sending ambassadors to the Lacedaemonians proposing a cessation of the 
<A NAME="319"></A>war on the basis of the existing Position; but as the Lacedaemonians refused 
<A NAME="320"></A>to listen to them unless they would also abandon the command of the sea, 
<A NAME="321"></A>they broke off the negotiations.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="322"></A><B>Part 33</B>

<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>For about four months the constitution of the Four Hundred lasted, 
<A NAME="324"></A>and Mnasilochus held office as Archon of their nomination for two months 
<A NAME="325"></A>of the year of Theopompus, who was Archon for the remaining ten. On the 
<A NAME="326"></A>loss of the naval battle of Eretria, however, and the revolt of the whole 
<A NAME="327"></A>of Euboea except Oreum, the indignation of the people was greater than 
<A NAME="328"></A>at any of the earlier disasters, since they drew far more supplies at this 
<A NAME="329"></A>time from Euboea than from Attica itself. Accordingly they deposed the 
<A NAME="330"></A>Four Hundred and committed the management of affairs to the Five Thousand, 
<A NAME="331"></A>consisting of persons Possessing a military equipment. At the same time 
<A NAME="332"></A>they voted that pay should not be given for any public office. The persons 
<A NAME="333"></A>chiefly responsible for the revolution were Aristocrates and Theramenes, 
<A NAME="334"></A>who disapproved of the action of the Four Hundred in retaining the direction 
<A NAME="335"></A>of affairs entirely in their own hands, and referring nothing to the Five 
<A NAME="336"></A>Thousand. During this period the constitution of the state seems to have 
<A NAME="337"></A>been admirable, since it was a time of war and the franchise was in the 
<A NAME="338"></A>hands of those who possessed a military equipment.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="339"></A><B>Part 34</B>

<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>The people, however, in a very short time deprived the Five Thousand 
<A NAME="341"></A>of their monopoly of the government. Then, six years after the overthrow 
<A NAME="342"></A>of the Four Hundred, in the archonship of Callias of Angele, battle of 
<A NAME="343"></A>Arginusae took place, of which the results were, first, that the ten generals 
<A NAME="344"></A>who had gained the victory were all condemned by a single decision, owing 
<A NAME="345"></A>to the people being led astray by persons who aroused their indignation; 
<A NAME="346"></A>though, as a matter of fact, some of the generals had actually taken no 
<A NAME="347"></A>part in the battle, and others were themselves picked up by other vessels. 
<A NAME="348"></A>Secondly, when the Lacedaemonians proposed to evacuate Decelea and make 
<A NAME="349"></A>peace on the basis of the existing position, although some of the Athenians 
<A NAME="350"></A>supported this proposal, the majority refused to listen to them. In this 
<A NAME="351"></A>they were led astray by Cleophon, who appeared in the Assembly drunk and 
<A NAME="352"></A>wearing his breastplate, and prevented peace being made, declaring that 
<A NAME="353"></A>he would never accept peace unless the Lacedaemonians abandoned their claims 
<A NAME="354"></A>on all the cities allied with them. They mismanaged their opportunity then, 
<A NAME="355"></A>and in a very short time they learnt their mistake. The next year, in the 
<A NAME="356"></A>archonship of Alexias, they suffered the disaster of Aegospotami, the consequence 
<A NAME="357"></A>of which was that Lysander became master of the city, and set up the Thirty 
<A NAME="358"></A>as its governors. He did so in the following manner. One of the terms of 
<A NAME="359"></A>peace stipulated that the state should be governed according to 'the ancient 
<A NAME="360"></A>constitution'. Accordingly the popular party tried to preserve the democracy, 
<A NAME="361"></A>while that part of the upper class which belonged to the political clubs, 
<A NAME="362"></A>together with the exiles who had returned since the peace, aimed at an 
<A NAME="363"></A>oligarchy, and those who were not members of any club, though in other 
<A NAME="364"></A>respects they considered themselves as good as any other citizens, were 
<A NAME="365"></A>anxious to restore the ancient constitution. The latter class included 
<A NAME="366"></A>Archinus, Anytus, Cleitophon, Phormisius, and many others, but their most 
<A NAME="367"></A>prominent leader was Theramenes. Lysander, however, threw his influence 
<A NAME="368"></A>on the side of the oligarchical party, and the popular Assembly was compelled 
<A NAME="369"></A>by sheer intimidation to pass a vote establishing the oligarchy. The motion 
<A NAME="370"></A>to this effect was proposed by Dracontides of Aphidna.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="371"></A><B>Part 35</B>

<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>In this way were the Thirty established in power, in the archonship 
<A NAME="373"></A>of Pythodorus. As soon, however, as they were masters of the city, they 
<A NAME="374"></A>ignored all the resolutions which had been passed relating to the organization 
<A NAME="375"></A>of the constitution, but after appointing a Council of Five Hundred and 
<A NAME="376"></A>the other magistrates out of a thousand selected candidates, and associating 
<A NAME="377"></A>with themselves ten Archons in Piraeus, eleven superintendents of the prison, 
<A NAME="378"></A>and three hundred 'lash-bearers' as attendants, with the help of these 
<A NAME="379"></A>they kept the city under their own control. At first, indeed, they behaved 
<A NAME="380"></A>with moderation towards the citizens and pretended to administer the state 
<A NAME="381"></A>according to the ancient constitution. In pursuance of this policy they 
<A NAME="382"></A>took down from the hill of Areopagus the laws of Ephialtes and Archestratus 
<A NAME="383"></A>relating to the Areopagite Council; they also repealed such of the statutes 
<A NAME="384"></A>of Solon as were obscure, and abolished the supreme power of the law-courts. 
<A NAME="385"></A>In this they claimed to be restoring the constitution and freeing it from 
<A NAME="386"></A>obscurities; as, for instance, by making the testator free once for all 
<A NAME="387"></A>to leave his property as he pleased, and abolishing the existing limitations 
<A NAME="388"></A>in cases of insanity, old age, and undue female influence, in order that 
<A NAME="389"></A>no opening might be left for professional accusers. In other matters also 
<A NAME="390"></A>their conduct was similar. At first, then, they acted on these lines, and 
<A NAME="391"></A>they destroyed the professional accusers and those mischievous and evil-minded 
<A NAME="392"></A>persons who, to the great detriment of the democracy, had attached themselves 
<A NAME="393"></A>to it in order to curry favour with it. With all of this the city was much 
<A NAME="394"></A>pleased, and thought that the Thirty were doing it with the best of motives. 
<A NAME="395"></A>But so soon as they had got a firmer hold on the city, they spared no class 
<A NAME="396"></A>of citizens, but put to death any persons who were eminent for wealth or 
<A NAME="397"></A>birth or character. Herein they aimed at removing all whom they had reason 
<A NAME="398"></A>to fear, while they also wished to lay hands on their possessions; and 
<A NAME="399"></A>in a short time they put to death not less than fifteen hundred 
<A NAME="400"></A>persons.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="401"></A><B>Part 36</B>

<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>Theramenes, however, seeing the city thus falling into ruin, was 
<A NAME="403"></A>displeased with their proceedings, and counselled them to cease such unprincipled 
<A NAME="404"></A>conduct and let the better classes have a share in the government. At first 
<A NAME="405"></A>they resisted his advice, but when his proposals came to be known abroad, 
<A NAME="406"></A>and the masses began to associate themselves with him, they were seized 
<A NAME="407"></A>with alarm lest he should make himself the leader of the people and destroy 
<A NAME="408"></A>their despotic power. Accordingly they drew up a list of three thousand 
<A NAME="409"></A>citizens, to whom they announced that they would give a share in the constitution. 
<A NAME="410"></A>Theramenes, however, criticized this scheme also, first on the ground that, 
<A NAME="411"></A>while proposing to give all respectable citizens a share in the constitution, 
<A NAME="412"></A>they were actually giving it only to three thousand persons, as though 
<A NAME="413"></A>all merit were confined within that number; and secondly because they were 
<A NAME="414"></A>doing two inconsistent things, since they made the government rest on the 
<A NAME="415"></A>basis of force, and yet made the governors inferior in strength to the 
<A NAME="416"></A>governed. However, they took no notice of his criticisms, and for a long 
<A NAME="417"></A>time put off the publication of the list of the Three Thousand and kept 
<A NAME="418"></A>to themselves the names of those who had been placed upon it; and every 
<A NAME="419"></A>time they did decide to publish it they proceeded to strike out some of 
<A NAME="420"></A>those who had been included in it, and insert others who had been 
<A NAME="421"></A>omitted.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="422"></A><B>Part 37</B>

<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>Now when winter had set in, Thrasybulus and the exiles occupied 
<A NAME="424"></A>Phyle, and the force which the Thirty led out to attack them met with a 
<A NAME="425"></A>reverse. Thereupon the Thirty decided to disarm the bulk of the population 
<A NAME="426"></A>and to get rid of Theramenes; which they did in the following way. They 
<A NAME="427"></A>introduced two laws into the Council, which they commanded it to pass; 
<A NAME="428"></A>the first of them gave the Thirty absolute power to put to death any citizen 
<A NAME="429"></A>who was not included in the list of the Three Thousand, while the second 
<A NAME="430"></A>disqualified all persons from participation in the franchise who should 
<A NAME="431"></A>have assisted in the demolition of the fort of Eetioneia, or have acted 
<A NAME="432"></A>in any way against the Four Hundred who had organized the previous oligarchy. 
<A NAME="433"></A>Theramenes had done both, and accordingly, when these laws were ratified, 
<A NAME="434"></A>he became excluded from the franchise and the Thirty had full power to 
<A NAME="435"></A>put him to death. Theramenes having been thus removed, they disarmed all 
<A NAME="436"></A>the people except the Three Thousand, and in every respect showed a great 
<A NAME="437"></A>advance in cruelty and crime. They also sent ambassadors to Lacedaemonian 
<A NAME="438"></A>to blacken the character of Theramenes and to ask for help; and the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="439"></A>in answer to their appeal, sent Callibius as military governor with about 
<A NAME="440"></A>seven hundred troops, who came and occupied the Acropolis.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="441"></A><B>Part 38</B>

<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>These events were followed by the occupation of Munichia by the 
<A NAME="443"></A>exiles from Phyle, and their victory over the Thirty and their partisans. 
<A NAME="444"></A>After the fight the party of the city retreated, and next day they held 
<A NAME="445"></A>a meeting in the marketplace and deposed the Thirty, and elected ten citizens 
<A NAME="446"></A>with full powers to bring the war to a termination. When, however, the 
<A NAME="447"></A>Ten had taken over the government they did nothing towards the object for 
<A NAME="448"></A>which they were elected, but sent envoys to Lacedaemonian to ask for help 
<A NAME="449"></A>and to borrow money. Further, finding that the citizens who possessed the 
<A NAME="450"></A>franchise were displeased at their proceedings, they were afraid lest they 
<A NAME="451"></A>should be deposed, and consequently, in order to strike terror into them 
<A NAME="452"></A>(in which design they succeeded), they arrested Demaretus, one of the most 
<A NAME="453"></A>eminent citizens, and put him to death. This gave them a firm hold on the 
<A NAME="454"></A>government, and they also had the support of Callibius and his Peloponnesians, 
<A NAME="455"></A>together with several of the Knights; for some of the members of this class 
<A NAME="456"></A>were the most zealous among the citizens to prevent the return of the exiles 
<A NAME="457"></A>from Phyle. When, however, the party in Piraeus and Munichia began to gain 
<A NAME="458"></A>the upper hand in the war, through the defection of the whole populace 
<A NAME="459"></A>to them, the party in the city deposed the original Ten, and elected another 
<A NAME="460"></A>Ten, consisting of men of the highest repute. Under their administration, 
<A NAME="461"></A>and with their active and zealous cooperation, the treaty of reconciliation 
<A NAME="462"></A>was made and the populace returned to the city. The most prominent members 
<A NAME="463"></A>of this board were Rhinon of Paeania and Phayllus of Acherdus, who, even 
<A NAME="464"></A>before the arrival of Pausanias, opened negotiations with the party in 
<A NAME="465"></A>Piraeus, and after his arrival seconded his efforts to bring about the 
<A NAME="466"></A>return of the exiles. For it was Pausanias, the king of the Lacedaemonians, 
<A NAME="467"></A>who brought the peace and reconciliation to a fulfillment, in conjunction 
<A NAME="468"></A>with the ten commissioners of arbitration who arrived later from Lacedaemonian, 
<A NAME="469"></A>at his own earnest request. Rhinon and his colleagues received a vote of 
<A NAME="470"></A>thanks for the goodwill shown by them to the people, and though they received 
<A NAME="471"></A>their charge under an oligarchy and handed in their accounts under a democracy, 
<A NAME="472"></A>no one, either of the party that had stayed in the city or of the exiles 
<A NAME="473"></A>that had returned from the Piraeus, brought any complaint against them. 
<A NAME="474"></A>On the contrary, Rhinon was immediately elected general on account of his 
<A NAME="475"></A>conduct in this office.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="476"></A><B>Part 39</B>

<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR>This reconciliation was effected in the archonship of Eucleides, 
<A NAME="478"></A>on the following terms. All persons who, having remained in the city during 
<A NAME="479"></A>the troubles, were now anxious to leave it, were to be free to settle at 
<A NAME="480"></A>Eleusis, retaining their civil rights and possessing full and independent 
<A NAME="481"></A>powers of self-government, and with the free enjoyment of their own personal 
<A NAME="482"></A>property. The temple at Eleusis should be common ground for both parties, 
<A NAME="483"></A>and should be under the superintendence of the Ceryces, and the Eumolpidae, 
<A NAME="484"></A>according to primitive custom. The settlers at Eleusis should not be allowed 
<A NAME="485"></A>to enter Athens, nor the people of Athens to enter Eleusis, except at the 
<A NAME="486"></A>season of the mysteries, when both parties should be free from these restrictions. 
<A NAME="487"></A>The secessionists should pay their share to the fund for the common defence 
<A NAME="488"></A>out of their revenues, just like all the other Athenians. If any of the 
<A NAME="489"></A>seceding party wished to take a house in Eleusis, the people would help 
<A NAME="490"></A>them to obtain the consent of the owner; but if they could not come to 
<A NAME="491"></A>terms, they should appoint three valuers on either side, and the owner 
<A NAME="492"></A>should receive whatever price they should appoint. Of the inhabitants of 
<A NAME="493"></A>Eleusis, those whom the secessionists wished to remain should be allowed 
<A NAME="494"></A>to do so. The list of those who desired to secede should be made up within 
<A NAME="495"></A>ten days after the taking of the oaths in the case of persons already in 
<A NAME="496"></A>the country, and their actual departure should take place within twenty 
<A NAME="497"></A>days; persons at present out of the country should have the same terms 
<A NAME="498"></A>allowed to them after their return. No one who settled at Eleusis should 
<A NAME="499"></A>be capable of holding any office in Athens until he should again register 
<A NAME="500"></A>himself on the roll as a resident in the city. Trials for homicide, including 
<A NAME="501"></A>all cases in which one party had either killed or wounded another, should 
<A NAME="502"></A>be conducted according to ancestral practice. There should be a general 
<A NAME="503"></A>amnesty concerning past events towards all persons except the Thirty, the 
<A NAME="504"></A>Ten, the Eleven, and the magistrates in Piraeus; and these too should be 
<A NAME="505"></A>included if they should submit their accounts in the usual way. Such accounts 
<A NAME="506"></A>should be given by the magistrates in Piraeus before a court of citizens 
<A NAME="507"></A>rated in Piraeus, and by the magistrates in the city before a court of 
<A NAME="508"></A>those rated in the city. On these terms those who wished to do so might 
<A NAME="509"></A>secede. Each party was to repay separately the money which it had borrowed 
<A NAME="510"></A>for the war.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="511"></A><B>Part 40</B>

<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>When the reconciliation had taken place on these terms, those who 
<A NAME="513"></A>had fought on the side of the Thirty felt considerable apprehensions, and 
<A NAME="514"></A>a large number intended to secede. But as they put off entering their names 
<A NAME="515"></A>till the last moment, as people will do, Archinus, observing their numbers, 
<A NAME="516"></A>and being anxious to retain them as citizens, cut off the remaining days 
<A NAME="517"></A>during which the list should have remained open; and in this way many persons 
<A NAME="518"></A>were compelled to remain, though they did so very unwillingly until they 
<A NAME="519"></A>recovered confidence. This is one point in which Archinus appears to have 
<A NAME="520"></A>acted in a most statesmanlike manner, and another was his subsequent prosecution 
<A NAME="521"></A>of Thrasybulus on the charge of illegality, for a motion by which he proposed 
<A NAME="522"></A>to confer the franchise on all who had taken part in the return from Piraeus, 
<A NAME="523"></A>although some of them were notoriously slaves. And yet a third such action 
<A NAME="524"></A>was when one of the returned exiles began to violate the amnesty, whereupon 
<A NAME="525"></A>Archinus haled him to the Council and persuaded them to execute him without 
<A NAME="526"></A>trial, telling them that now they would have to show whether they wished 
<A NAME="527"></A>to preserve the democracy and abide by the oaths they had taken; for if 
<A NAME="528"></A>they let this man escape they would encourage others to imitate him, while 
<A NAME="529"></A>if they executed him they would make an example for all to learn by. And 
<A NAME="530"></A>this was exactly what happened; for after this man had been put to death 
<A NAME="531"></A>no one ever again broke the amnesty. On the contrary, the Athenians seem, 
<A NAME="532"></A>both in public and in private, to have behaved in the most unprecedentedly 
<A NAME="533"></A>admirable and public-spirited way with reference to the preceding troubles. 
<A NAME="534"></A>Not only did they blot out all memory of former offences, but they even 
<A NAME="535"></A>repaid to the Lacedaemonians out of the public purse the money which the 
<A NAME="536"></A>Thirty had borrowed for the war, although the treaty required each party, 
<A NAME="537"></A>the party of the city and the party of Piraeus, to pay its own debts separately. 
<A NAME="538"></A>This they did because they thought it was a necessary first step in the 
<A NAME="539"></A>direction of restoring harmony; but in other states, so far from the democratic 
<A NAME="540"></A>parties making advances from their own possessions, they are rather in 
<A NAME="541"></A>the habit of making a general redistribution of the land. A final reconciliation 
<A NAME="542"></A>was made with the secessionists at Eleusis two years after the secession, 
<A NAME="543"></A>in the archonship of Xenaenetus.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="544"></A><B>Part 41</B>

<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>This, however, took place at a later date; at the time of which 
<A NAME="546"></A>we are speaking the people, having secured the control of the state, established 
<A NAME="547"></A>the constitution which exists at the present day. Pythodorus was Archon 
<A NAME="548"></A>at the time, but the democracy seems to have assumed the supreme power 
<A NAME="549"></A>with perfect justice, since it had effected its own return by its own exertions. 
<A NAME="550"></A>This was the eleventh change which had taken place in the constitution 
<A NAME="551"></A>of Athens. The first modification of the primaeval condition of things 
<A NAME="552"></A>was when Ion and his companions brought the people together into a community, 
<A NAME="553"></A>for then the people was first divided into the four tribes, and the tribe-kings 
<A NAME="554"></A>were created. Next, and first after this, having now some semblance of 
<A NAME="555"></A>a constitution, was that which took place in the reign of Theseus, consisting 
<A NAME="556"></A>in a slight deviation from absolute monarchy. After this came the constitution 
<A NAME="557"></A>formed under Draco, when the first code of laws was drawn up. The third 
<A NAME="558"></A>was that which followed the civil war, in the time of Solon; from this 
<A NAME="559"></A>the democracy took its rise. The fourth was the tyranny of Pisistratus; 
<A NAME="560"></A>the fifth the constitution of Cleisthenes, after the overthrow of the tyrants, 
<A NAME="561"></A>of a more democratic character than that of Solon. The sixth was that which 
<A NAME="562"></A>followed on the Persian wars, when the Council of Areopagus had the direction 
<A NAME="563"></A>of the state. The seventh, succeeding this, was the constitution which 
<A NAME="564"></A>Aristides sketched out, and which Ephialtes brought to completion by overthrowing 
<A NAME="565"></A>the Areopagite Council; under this the nation, misled by the demagogues, 
<A NAME="566"></A>made the most serious mistakes in the interest of its maritime empire. 
<A NAME="567"></A>The eighth was the establishment of the Four Hundred, followed by the ninth, 
<A NAME="568"></A>the restored democracy. The tenth was the tyranny of the Thirty and the 
<A NAME="569"></A>Ten. The eleventh was that which followed the return from Phyle and Piraeus; 
<A NAME="570"></A>and this has continued from that day to this, with continual accretions 
<A NAME="571"></A>of power to the masses. The democracy has made itself master of everything 
<A NAME="572"></A>and administers everything by its votes in the Assembly and by the law-courts, 
<A NAME="573"></A>in which it holds the supreme power. Even the jurisdiction of the Council 
<A NAME="574"></A>has passed into the hands of the people at large; and this appears to be 
<A NAME="575"></A>a judicious change, since small bodies are more open to corruption, whether 
<A NAME="576"></A>by actual money or influence, than large ones. At first they refused to 
<A NAME="577"></A>allow payment for attendance at the Assembly; but the result was that people 
<A NAME="578"></A>did not attend. Consequently, after the Prytanes had tried many devices 
<A NAME="579"></A>in vain in order to induce the populace to come and ratify the votes, Agyrrhius, 
<A NAME="580"></A>in the first instance, made a provision of one obol a day, which Heracleides 
<A NAME="581"></A>of Clazomenae, nicknamed 'the king', increased to two obols, and Agyrrhius 
<A NAME="582"></A>again to three.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="583"></A><B>Part 42</B>

<A NAME="584"></A><BR><BR>The present state of the constitution is as follows. The franchise 
<A NAME="585"></A>is open to all who are of citizen birth by both parents. They are enrolled 
<A NAME="586"></A>among the demesmen at the age of eighteen. On the occasion of their enrollment 
<A NAME="587"></A>the demesmen give their votes on oath, first whether the candidates appear 
<A NAME="588"></A>to be of the age prescribed by the law (if not, they are dismissed back 
<A NAME="589"></A>into the ranks of the boys), and secondly whether the candidate is free 
<A NAME="590"></A>born and of such parentage as the laws require. Then if they decide that 
<A NAME="591"></A>he is not a free man, he appeals to the law-courts, and the demesmen appoint 
<A NAME="592"></A>five of their own number to act as accusers; if the court decides that 
<A NAME="593"></A>he has no right to be enrolled, he is sold by the state as a slave, but 
<A NAME="594"></A>if he wins his case he has a right to be enrolled among the demesmen without 
<A NAME="595"></A>further question. After this the Council examines those who have been enrolled, 
<A NAME="596"></A>and if it comes to the conclusion that any of them is less than eighteen 
<A NAME="597"></A>years of age, it fines the demesmen who enrolled him. When the youths (Ephebi) 
<A NAME="598"></A>have passed this examination, their fathers meet by their tribes, and appoint 
<A NAME="599"></A>on oath three of their fellow tribesmen, over forty years of age, who, 
<A NAME="600"></A>in their opinion, are the best and most suitable persons to have charge 
<A NAME="601"></A>of the youths; and of these the Assembly elects one from each tribe as 
<A NAME="602"></A>guardian, together with a director, chosen from the general body of Athenians, 
<A NAME="603"></A>to control the while. Under the charge of these persons the youths first 
<A NAME="604"></A>of all make the circuit of the temples; then they proceed to Piraeus, and 
<A NAME="605"></A>some of them garrison Munichia and some the south shore. The Assembly also 
<A NAME="606"></A>elects two trainers, with subordinate instructors, who teach them to fight 
<A NAME="607"></A>in heavy armour, to use the bow and javelin, and to discharge a catapult. 
<A NAME="608"></A>The guardians receive from the state a drachma apiece for their keep, and 
<A NAME="609"></A>the youths four obols apiece. Each guardian receives the allowance for 
<A NAME="610"></A>all the members of his tribe and buys the necessary provisions for the 
<A NAME="611"></A>common stock (they mess together by tribes), and generally superintends 
<A NAME="612"></A>everything. In this way they spend the first year. The next year, after 
<A NAME="613"></A>giving a public display of their military evolutions, on the occasion when 
<A NAME="614"></A>the Assembly meets in the theatre, they receive a shield and spear from 
<A NAME="615"></A>the state; after which they patrol the country and spend their time in 
<A NAME="616"></A>the forts. For these two years they are on garrison duty, and wear the 
<A NAME="617"></A>military cloak, and during this time they are exempt from all taxes. They 
<A NAME="618"></A>also can neither bring an action at law, nor have one brought against them, 
<A NAME="619"></A>in order that they may have no excuse for requiring leave of absence; though 
<A NAME="620"></A>exception is made in cases of actions concerning inheritances and wards 
<A NAME="621"></A>of state, or of any sacrificial ceremony connected with the family. When 
<A NAME="622"></A>the two years have elapsed they thereupon take their position among the 
<A NAME="623"></A>other citizens. Such is the manner of the enrollment of the citizens and 
<A NAME="624"></A>the training of the youths.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="625"></A><B>Part 43</B>

<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>All the magistrates that are concerned with the ordinary routine 
<A NAME="627"></A>of administration are elected by lot, except the Military Treasurer, the 
<A NAME="628"></A>Commissioners of the Theoric fund, and the Superintendent of Springs. These 
<A NAME="629"></A>are elected by vote, and hold office from one Panathenaic festival to the 
<A NAME="630"></A>next. All military officers are also elected by vote.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>The Council of Five Hundred is elected by lot, fifty from each 
<A NAME="632"></A>tribe. Each tribe holds the office of Prytanes in turn, the order being 
<A NAME="633"></A>determined by lot; the first four serve for thirty-six days each, the last 
<A NAME="634"></A>six for thirty-five, since the reckoning is by lunar years. The Prytanes 
<A NAME="635"></A>for the time being, in the first place, mess together in the Tholus, and 
<A NAME="636"></A>receive a sum of money from the state for their maintenance; and, secondly, 
<A NAME="637"></A>they convene the meetings of the Council and the Assembly. The Council 
<A NAME="638"></A>they convene every day, unless it is a holiday, the Assembly four times 
<A NAME="639"></A>in each prytany. It is also their duty to draw up the programme of the 
<A NAME="640"></A>business of the Council and to decide what subjects are to be dealt with 
<A NAME="641"></A>on each particular da, and where the sitting is to be held. They also draw 
<A NAME="642"></A>up the programme for the meetings of the Assembly. One of these in each 
<A NAME="643"></A>prytany is called the 'sovereign' Assembly; in this the people have to 
<A NAME="644"></A>ratify the continuance of the magistrates in office, if they are performing 
<A NAME="645"></A>their duties properly, and to consider the supply of corn and the defence 
<A NAME="646"></A>of the country. On this day, too, impeachments are introduced by those 
<A NAME="647"></A>who wish to do so, the lists of property confiscated by the state are read, 
<A NAME="648"></A>and also applications for inheritances and wards of state, so that nothing 
<A NAME="649"></A>may pass unclaimed without the cognizance of any person concerned. In the 
<A NAME="650"></A>sixth prytany, in addition to the business already stated, the question 
<A NAME="651"></A>is put to the vote whether it is desirable to hold a vote of ostracism 
<A NAME="652"></A>or not; and complaints against professional accusers, whether Athenian 
<A NAME="653"></A>or aliens domiciled in Athens, are received, to the number of not more 
<A NAME="654"></A>than three of either class, together with cases in which an individual 
<A NAME="655"></A>has made some promise to the people and has not performed it. Another Assembly 
<A NAME="656"></A>in each prytany is assigned to the hearing of petitions, and at this meeting 
<A NAME="657"></A>any one is free, on depositing the petitioner's olive-branch, to speak 
<A NAME="658"></A>to the people concerning any matter, public or private. The two remaining 
<A NAME="659"></A>meetings are devoted to all other subjects, and the laws require them to 
<A NAME="660"></A>deal with three questions connected with religion, three connected with 
<A NAME="661"></A>heralds and embassies, and three on secular subjects. Sometimes questions 
<A NAME="662"></A>are brought forward without a preliminary vote of the Assembly to take 
<A NAME="663"></A>them into consideration.
<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>Heralds and envoys appear first before the Prytanes, and the bearers 
<A NAME="665"></A>of dispatches also deliver them to the same officials.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="666"></A><B>Part 44</B>

<A NAME="667"></A><BR><BR>There is a single President of the Prytanes, elected by lot, who 
<A NAME="668"></A>presides for a night and a day; he may not hold the office for more than 
<A NAME="669"></A>that time, nor may the same individual hold it twice. He keeps the keys 
<A NAME="670"></A>of the sanctuaries in which the treasures and public records of the state 
<A NAME="671"></A>are preserved, and also the public seal; and he is bound to remain in the 
<A NAME="672"></A>Tholus, together with one-third of the Prytanes, named by himself. Whenever 
<A NAME="673"></A>the Prytanes convene a meeting of the Council or Assembly, he appoints 
<A NAME="674"></A>by lot nine Proedri, one from each tribe except that which holds the office 
<A NAME="675"></A>of Prytanes for the time being; and out of these nine he similarly appoints 
<A NAME="676"></A>one as President, and hands over the programme for the meeting to them. 
<A NAME="677"></A>They take it and see to the preservation of order, put forward the various 
<A NAME="678"></A>subjects which are to be considered, decide the results of the votings, 
<A NAME="679"></A>and direct the proceedings generally. They also have power to dismiss the 
<A NAME="680"></A>meeting. No one may act as President more than once in the year, but he 
<A NAME="681"></A>may be a Proedrus once in each prytany.
<A NAME="682"></A><BR><BR>Elections to the offices of General and Hipparch and all other 
<A NAME="683"></A>military commands are held in the Assembly, in such manner as the people 
<A NAME="684"></A>decide; they are held after the sixth prytany by the first board of Prytanes 
<A NAME="685"></A>in whose term of office the omens are favourable. There has, however, to 
<A NAME="686"></A>be a preliminary consideration by the Council in this case 
<A NAME="687"></A>also.
