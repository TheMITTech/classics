<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Every systematic science, the humblest and the noblest alike, seems to 
<A NAME="12"></A>admit of two distinct kinds of proficiency; one of which may be properly 
<A NAME="13"></A>called scientific knowledge of the subject, while the other is a kind of 
<A NAME="14"></A>educational acquaintance with it. For an educated man should be able to 
<A NAME="15"></A>form a fair off-hand judgement as to the goodness or badness of the method 
<A NAME="16"></A>used by a professor in his exposition. To be educated is in fact to be 
<A NAME="17"></A>able to do this; and even the man of universal education we deem to be 
<A NAME="18"></A>such in virtue of his having this ability. It will, however, of course, 
<A NAME="19"></A>be understood that we only ascribe universal education to one who in his 
<A NAME="20"></A>own individual person is thus critical in all or nearly all branches of 
<A NAME="21"></A>knowledge, and not to one who has a like ability merely in some special 
<A NAME="22"></A>subject. For it is possible for a man to have this competence in some one 
<A NAME="23"></A>branch of knowledge without having it in all.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>It is plain then that, as in other sciences, so in that which inquires 
<A NAME="25"></A>into nature, there must be certain canons, by reference to which a hearer 
<A NAME="26"></A>shall be able to criticize the method of a professed exposition, quite 
<A NAME="27"></A>independently of the question whether the statements made be true or false. 
<A NAME="28"></A>Ought we, for instance (to give an illustration of what I mean), to begin 
<A NAME="29"></A>by discussing each separate species-man, lion, ox, and the like-taking 
<A NAME="30"></A>each kind in hand inde. pendently of the rest, or ought we rather to deal 
<A NAME="31"></A>first with the attributes which they have in common in virtue of some common 
<A NAME="32"></A>element of their nature, and proceed from this as a basis for the consideration 
<A NAME="33"></A>of them separately? For genera that are quite distinct yet oftentimes present 
<A NAME="34"></A>many identical phenomena, sleep, for instance, respiration, growth, decay, 
<A NAME="35"></A>death, and other similar affections and conditions, which may be passed 
<A NAME="36"></A>over for the present, as we are not yet prepared to treat of them with 
<A NAME="37"></A>clearness and precision. Now it is plain that if we deal with each species 
<A NAME="38"></A>independently of the rest, we shall frequently be obliged to repeat the 
<A NAME="39"></A>same statements over and over again; for horse and dog and man present, 
<A NAME="40"></A>each and all, every one of the phenomena just enumerated. A discussion 
<A NAME="41"></A>therefore of the attributes of each such species separately would necessarily 
<A NAME="42"></A>involve frequent repetitions as to characters, themselves identical but 
<A NAME="43"></A>recurring in animals specifically distinct. (Very possibly also there may 
<A NAME="44"></A>be other characters which, though they present specific differences, yet 
<A NAME="45"></A>come under one and the same category. For instance, flying, swimming, walking, 
<A NAME="46"></A>creeping, are plainly specifically distinct, but yet are all forms of animal 
<A NAME="47"></A>progression.) We must, then, have some clear understanding as to the manner 
<A NAME="48"></A>in which our investigation is to be conducted; whether, I mean, we are 
<A NAME="49"></A>first to deal with the common or generic characters, and afterwards to 
<A NAME="50"></A>take into consideration special peculiarities; or whether we are to start 
<A NAME="51"></A>straight off with the ultimate species. For as yet no definite rule has 
<A NAME="52"></A>been laid down in this matter. So also there is a like uncertainty as to 
<A NAME="53"></A>another point now to be mentioned. Ought the writer who deals with the 
<A NAME="54"></A>works of nature to follow the plan adopted by the mathematicians in their 
<A NAME="55"></A>astronomical demonstrations, and after considering the phenomena presented 
<A NAME="56"></A>by animals, and their several parts, proceed subsequently to treat of the 
<A NAME="57"></A>causes and the reason why; or ought he to follow some other method? And 
<A NAME="58"></A>when these questions are answered, there yet remains another. The causes 
<A NAME="59"></A>concerned in the generation of the works of nature are, as we see, more 
<A NAME="60"></A>than one. There is the final cause and there is the motor cause. Now we 
<A NAME="61"></A>must decide which of these two causes comes first, which second. Plainly, 
<A NAME="62"></A>however, that cause is the first which we call the final one. For this 
<A NAME="63"></A>is the Reason, and the Reason forms the starting-point, alike in the works 
<A NAME="64"></A>of art and in works of nature. For consider how the physician or how the 
<A NAME="65"></A>builder sets about his work. He starts by forming for himself a definite 
<A NAME="66"></A>picture, in the one case perceptible to mind, in the other to sense, of 
<A NAME="67"></A>his end-the physician of health, the builder of a house-and this he holds 
<A NAME="68"></A>forward as the reason and explanation of each subsequent step that he takes, 
<A NAME="69"></A>and of his acting in this or that way as the case may be. Now in the works 
<A NAME="70"></A>of nature the good end and the final cause is still more dominant than 
<A NAME="71"></A>in works of art such as these, nor is necessity a factor with the same 
<A NAME="72"></A>significance in them all; though almost all writers, while they try to 
<A NAME="73"></A>refer their origin to this cause, do so without distinguishing the various 
<A NAME="74"></A>senses in which the term necessity is used. For there is absolute necessity, 
<A NAME="75"></A>manifested in eternal phenomena; and there is hypothetical necessity, manifested 
<A NAME="76"></A>in everything that is generated by nature as in everything that is produced 
<A NAME="77"></A>by art, be it a house or what it may. For if a house or other such final 
<A NAME="78"></A>object is to be realized, it is necessary that such and such material shall 
<A NAME="79"></A>exist; and it is necessary that first this then that shall be produced, 
<A NAME="80"></A>and first this and then that set in motion, and so on in continuous succession, 
<A NAME="81"></A>until the end and final result is reached, for the sake of which each prior 
<A NAME="82"></A>thing is produced and exists. As with these productions of art, so also 
<A NAME="83"></A>is it with the productions of nature. The mode of necessity, however, and 
<A NAME="84"></A>the mode of ratiocination are different in natural science from what they 
<A NAME="85"></A>are in the theoretical sciences; of which we have spoken elsewhere. For 
<A NAME="86"></A>in the latter the starting-point is that which is; in the former that which 
<A NAME="87"></A>is to be. For it is that which is yet to be-health, let us say, or a man-that, 
<A NAME="88"></A>owing to its being of such and such characters, necessitates the pre-existence 
<A NAME="89"></A>or previous production of this and that antecedent; and not this or that 
<A NAME="90"></A>antecedent which, because it exists or has been generated, makes it necessary 
<A NAME="91"></A>that health or a man is in, or shall come into, existence. Nor is it possible 
<A NAME="92"></A>to track back the series of necessary antecedents to a starting-point, 
<A NAME="93"></A>of which you can say that, existing itself from eternity, it has determined 
<A NAME="94"></A>their existence as its consequent. These however again, are matters that 
<A NAME="95"></A>have been dealt with in another treatise. There too it was stated in what 
<A NAME="96"></A>cases absolute and hypothetical necessity exist; in what cases also the 
<A NAME="97"></A>proposition expressing hypothetical necessity is simply convertible, and 
<A NAME="98"></A>what cause it is that determines this convertibility.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>Another matter which must not be passed over without consideration 
<A NAME="100"></A>is, whether the proper subject of our exposition is that with which the 
<A NAME="101"></A>ancient writers concerned themselves, namely, what is the process of formation 
<A NAME="102"></A>of each animal; or whether it is not rather, what are the characters of 
<A NAME="103"></A>a given creature when formed. For there is no small difference between 
<A NAME="104"></A>these two views. The best course appears to be that we should follow the 
<A NAME="105"></A>method already mentioned, and begin with the phenomena presented by each 
<A NAME="106"></A>group of animals, and, when this is done, proceed afterwards to state the 
<A NAME="107"></A>causes of those phenomena, and to deal with their evolution. For elsewhere, 
<A NAME="108"></A>as for instance in house building, this is the true sequence. The plan 
<A NAME="109"></A>of the house, or the house, has this and that form; and because it has 
<A NAME="110"></A>this and that form, therefore is its construction carried out in this or 
<A NAME="111"></A>that manner. For the process of evolution is for the sake of the thing 
<A NAME="112"></A>finally evolved, and not this for the sake of the process. Empedocles, then, 
<A NAME="113"></A>was in error when he said that many of the characters presented by animals 
<A NAME="114"></A>were merely the results of incidental occurrences during their development; 
<A NAME="115"></A>for instance, that the backbone was divided as it is into vertebrae, because 
<A NAME="116"></A>it happened to be broken owing to the contorted position of the foetus 
<A NAME="117"></A>in the womb. In so saying he overlooked the fact that propagation implies 
<A NAME="118"></A>a creative seed endowed with certain formative properties. Secondly, he 
<A NAME="119"></A>neglected another fact, namely, that the parent animal pre-exists, not 
<A NAME="120"></A>only in idea, but actually in time. For man is generated from man; and 
<A NAME="121"></A>thus it is the possession of certain characters by the parent that determines 
<A NAME="122"></A>the development of like characters in the child. The same statement holds 
<A NAME="123"></A>good also for the operations of art, and even for those which are apparently 
<A NAME="124"></A>spontaneous. For the same result as is produced by art may occur spontaneously. 
<A NAME="125"></A>Spontaneity, for instance, may bring about the restoration of health. The 
<A NAME="126"></A>products of art, however, require the pre-existence of an efficient cause 
<A NAME="127"></A>homogeneous with themselves, such as the statuary's art, which must necessarily 
<A NAME="128"></A>precede the statue; for this cannot possibly be produced spontaneously. 
<A NAME="129"></A>Art indeed consists in the conception of the result to be produced before 
<A NAME="130"></A>its realization in the material. As with spontaneity, so with chance; for 
<A NAME="131"></A>this also produces the same result as art, and by the same 
<A NAME="132"></A>process.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>The fittest mode, then, of treatment is to say, a man has such 
<A NAME="134"></A>and such parts, because the conception of a man includes their presence, 
<A NAME="135"></A>and because they are necessary conditions of his existence, or, if we cannot 
<A NAME="136"></A>quite say this, which would be best of all, then the next thing to it, 
<A NAME="137"></A>namely, that it is either quite impossible for him to exist without them, 
<A NAME="138"></A>or, at any rate, that it is better for him that they should be there; and 
<A NAME="139"></A>their existence involves the existence of other antecedents. Thus we should 
<A NAME="140"></A>say, because man is an animal with such and such characters, therefore 
<A NAME="141"></A>is the process of his development necessarily such as it is; and therefore 
<A NAME="142"></A>is it accomplished in such and such an order, this part being formed first, 
<A NAME="143"></A>that next, and so on in succession; and after a like fashion should we 
<A NAME="144"></A>explain the evolution of all other works of nature.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>Now that with which the ancient writers, who first philosophized 
<A NAME="146"></A>about Nature, busied themselves, was the material principle and the material 
<A NAME="147"></A>cause. They inquired what this is, and what its character; how the universe 
<A NAME="148"></A>is generated out of it, and by what motor influence, whether, for instance, 
<A NAME="149"></A>by antagonism or friendship, whether by intelligence or spontaneous action, 
<A NAME="150"></A>the substratum of matter being assumed to have certain inseparable properties; 
<A NAME="151"></A>fire, for instance, to have a hot nature, earth a cold one; the former 
<A NAME="152"></A>to be light, the latter heavy. For even the genesis of the universe is 
<A NAME="153"></A>thus explained by them. After a like fashion do they deal also with the 
<A NAME="154"></A>development of plants and of animals. They say, for instance, that the 
<A NAME="155"></A>water contained in the body causes by its currents the formation of the 
<A NAME="156"></A>stomach and the other receptacles of food or of excretion; and that the 
<A NAME="157"></A>breath by its passage breaks open the outlets of the nostrils; air and 
<A NAME="158"></A>water being the materials of which bodies are made; for all represent nature 
<A NAME="159"></A>as composed of such or similar substances.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>But if men and animals and their several parts are natural phenomena, 
<A NAME="161"></A>then the natural philosopher must take into consideration not merely the 
<A NAME="162"></A>ultimate substances of which they are made, but also flesh, bone, blood, 
<A NAME="163"></A>and all other homogeneous parts; not only these, but also the heterogeneous 
<A NAME="164"></A>parts, such as face, hand, foot; and must examine how each of these comes 
<A NAME="165"></A>to be what it is, and in virtue of what force. For to say what are the 
<A NAME="166"></A>ultimate substances out of which an animal is formed, to state, for instance, 
<A NAME="167"></A>that it is made of fire or earth, is no more sufficient than would be a 
<A NAME="168"></A>similar account in the case of a couch or the like. For we should not be 
<A NAME="169"></A>content with saying that the couch was made of bronze or wood or whatever 
<A NAME="170"></A>it might be, but should try to describe its design or mode of composition 
<A NAME="171"></A>in preference to the material; or, if we did deal with the material, it 
<A NAME="172"></A>would at any rate be with the concretion of material and form. For a couch 
<A NAME="173"></A>is such and such a form embodied in this or that matter, or such and such 
<A NAME="174"></A>a matter with this or that form; so that its shape and structure must be 
<A NAME="175"></A>included in our description. For the formal nature is of greater importance 
<A NAME="176"></A>than the material nature.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>Does, then, configuration and colour constitute the essence of 
<A NAME="178"></A>the various animals and of their several parts? For if so, what Democritus 
<A NAME="179"></A>says will be strictly correct. For such appears to have been his notion. 
<A NAME="180"></A>At any rate he says that it is evident to every one what form it is that 
<A NAME="181"></A>makes the man, seeing that he is recognizable by his shape and colour. 
<A NAME="182"></A>And yet a dead body has exactly the same configuration as a living one; 
<A NAME="183"></A>but for all that is not a man. So also no hand of bronze or wood or constituted 
<A NAME="184"></A>in any but the appropriate way can possibly be a hand in more than name. 
<A NAME="185"></A>For like a physician in a painting, or like a flute in a sculpture, in 
<A NAME="186"></A>spite of its name it will be unable to do the office which that name implies. 
<A NAME="187"></A>Precisely in the same way no part of a dead body, such I mean as its eye 
<A NAME="188"></A>or its hand, is really an eye or a hand. To say, then, that shape and colour 
<A NAME="189"></A>constitute the animal is an inadequate statement, and is much the same 
<A NAME="190"></A>as if a woodcarver were to insist that the hand he had cut out was really 
<A NAME="191"></A>a hand. Yet the physiologists, when they give an account of the development 
<A NAME="192"></A>and causes of the animal form, speak very much like such a craftsman. What, 
<A NAME="193"></A>however, I would ask, are the forces by which the hand or the body was 
<A NAME="194"></A>fashioned into its shape? The woodcarver will perhaps say, by the axe or 
<A NAME="195"></A>the auger; the physiologist, by air and by earth. Of these two answers 
<A NAME="196"></A>the artificer's is the better, but it is nevertheless insufficient. For 
<A NAME="197"></A>it is not enough for him to say that by the stroke of his tool this part 
<A NAME="198"></A>was formed into a concavity, that into a flat surface; but he must state 
<A NAME="199"></A>the reasons why he struck his blow in such a way as to effect this, and 
<A NAME="200"></A>what his final object was; namely, that the piece of wood should develop 
<A NAME="201"></A>eventually into this or that shape. It is plain, then, that the teaching 
<A NAME="202"></A>of the old physiologists is inadequate, and that the true method is to 
<A NAME="203"></A>state what the definitive characters are that distinguish the animal as 
<A NAME="204"></A>a whole; to explain what it is both in substance and in form, and to deal 
<A NAME="205"></A>after the same fashion with its several organs; in fact, to proceed in 
<A NAME="206"></A>exactly the same way as we should do, were we giving a complete description 
<A NAME="207"></A>of a couch.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>If now this something that constitutes the form of the living being 
<A NAME="209"></A>be the soul, or part of the soul, or something that without the soul cannot 
<A NAME="210"></A>exist; as would seem to be the case, seeing at any rate that when the soul 
<A NAME="211"></A>departs, what is left is no longer a living animal, and that none of the 
<A NAME="212"></A>parts remain what they were before, excepting in mere configuration, like 
<A NAME="213"></A>the animals that in the fable are turned into stone; if, I say, this be 
<A NAME="214"></A>so, then it will come within the province of the natural philosopher to 
<A NAME="215"></A>inform himself concerning the soul, and to treat of it, either in its entirety, 
<A NAME="216"></A>or, at any rate, of that part of it which constitutes the essential character 
<A NAME="217"></A>of an animal; and it will be his duty to say what this soul or this part 
<A NAME="218"></A>of a soul is; and to discuss the attributes that attach to this essential 
<A NAME="219"></A>character, especially as nature is spoken of in two senses, and the nature 
<A NAME="220"></A>of a thing is either its matter or its essence; nature as essence including 
<A NAME="221"></A>both the motor cause and the final cause. Now it is in the latter of these 
<A NAME="222"></A>two senses that either the whole soul or some part of it constitutes the 
<A NAME="223"></A>nature of an animal; and inasmuch as it is the presence of the soul that 
<A NAME="224"></A>enables matter to constitute the animal nature, much more than it is the 
<A NAME="225"></A>presence of matter which so enables the soul, the inquirer into nature 
<A NAME="226"></A>is bound on every ground to treat of the soul rather than of the matter. 
<A NAME="227"></A>For though the wood of which they are made constitutes the couch and the 
<A NAME="228"></A>tripod, it only does so because it is capable of receiving such and such 
<A NAME="229"></A>a form.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>What has been said suggests the question, whether it is the whole 
<A NAME="231"></A>soul or only some part of it, the consideration of which comes within the 
<A NAME="232"></A>province of natural science. Now if it be of the whole soul that this should 
<A NAME="233"></A>treat, then there is no place for any other philosophy beside it. For as 
<A NAME="234"></A>it belongs in all cases to one and the same science to deal with correlated 
<A NAME="235"></A>subjects-one and the same science, for instance, deals with sensation and 
<A NAME="236"></A>with the objects of sense-and as therefore the intelligent soul and the 
<A NAME="237"></A>objects of intellect, being correlated, must belong to one and the same 
<A NAME="238"></A>science, it follows that natural science will have to include the whole 
<A NAME="239"></A>universe in its province. But perhaps it is not the whole soul, nor all 
<A NAME="240"></A>its parts collectively, that constitutes the source of motion; but there 
<A NAME="241"></A>may be one part, identical with that in plants, which is the source of 
<A NAME="242"></A>growth, another, namely the sensory part, which is the source of change 
<A NAME="243"></A>of quality, while still another, and this not the intellectual part, is 
<A NAME="244"></A>the source of locomotion. I say not the intellectual part; for other animals 
<A NAME="245"></A>than man have the power of locomotion, but in none but him is there intellect. 
<A NAME="246"></A>Thus then it is plain that it is not of the whole soul that we have to 
<A NAME="247"></A>treat. For it is not the whole soul that constitutes the animal nature, 
<A NAME="248"></A>but only some part or parts of it. Moreover, it is impossible that any 
<A NAME="249"></A>abstraction can form a subject of natural science, seeing that everything 
<A NAME="250"></A>that Nature makes is means to an end. For just as human creations are the 
<A NAME="251"></A>products of art, so living objects are manifest in the products of an analogous 
<A NAME="252"></A>cause or principle, not external but internal, derived like the hot and 
<A NAME="253"></A>the cold from the environing universe. And that the heaven, if it had an 
<A NAME="254"></A>origin, was evolved and is maintained by such a cause, there is therefore 
<A NAME="255"></A>even more reason to believe, than that mortal animals so originated. For 
<A NAME="256"></A>order and definiteness are much more plainly manifest in the celestial 
<A NAME="257"></A>bodies than in our own frame; while change and chance are characteristic 
<A NAME="258"></A>of the perishable things of earth. Yet there are some who, while they allow 
<A NAME="259"></A>that every animal exists and was generated by nature, nevertheless hold 
<A NAME="260"></A>that the heaven was constructed to be what it is by chance and spontaneity; 
<A NAME="261"></A>the heaven, in which not the faintest sign of haphazard or of disorder 
<A NAME="262"></A>is discernible! Again, whenever there is plainly some final end, to which 
<A NAME="263"></A>a motion tends should nothing stand in the way, we always say that such 
<A NAME="264"></A>final end is the aim or purpose of the motion; and from this it is evident 
<A NAME="265"></A>that there must be a something or other really existing, corresponding 
<A NAME="266"></A>to what we call by the name of Nature. For a given germ does not give rise 
<A NAME="267"></A>to any chance living being, nor spring from any chance one; but each germ 
<A NAME="268"></A>springs from a definite parent and gives rise to a definite progeny. And 
<A NAME="269"></A>thus it is the germ that is the ruling influence and fabricator of the 
<A NAME="270"></A>offspring. For these it is by nature, the offspring being at any rate that 
<A NAME="271"></A>which in nature will spring from it. At the same time the offspring is 
<A NAME="272"></A>anterior to the germ; for germ and perfected progeny are related as the 
<A NAME="273"></A>developmental process and the result. Anterior, however, to both germ and 
<A NAME="274"></A>product is the organism from which the germ was derived. For every germ 
<A NAME="275"></A>implies two organisms, the parent and the progeny. For germ or seed is 
<A NAME="276"></A>both the seed of the organism from which it came, of the horse, for instance, 
<A NAME="277"></A>from which it was derived, and the seed of the organism that will eventually 
<A NAME="278"></A>arise from it, of the mule, for example, which is developed from the seed 
<A NAME="279"></A>of the horse. The same seed then is the seed both of the horse and of the 
<A NAME="280"></A>mule, though in different ways as here set forth. Moreover, the seed is 
<A NAME="281"></A>potentially that which will spring from it, and the relation of potentiality 
<A NAME="282"></A>to actuality we know.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>There are then two causes, namely, necessity and the final end. 
<A NAME="284"></A>For many things are produced, simply as the results of necessity. It may, 
<A NAME="285"></A>however, be asked, of what mode of necessity are we speaking when we say 
<A NAME="286"></A>this. For it can be of neither of those two modes which are set forth in 
<A NAME="287"></A>the philosophical treatises. There is, however, the third mode, in such 
<A NAME="288"></A>things at any rate as are generated. For instance, we say that food is 
<A NAME="289"></A>necessary; because an animal cannot possibly do without it. This third 
<A NAME="290"></A>mode is what may be called hypothetical necessity. Here is another example 
<A NAME="291"></A>of it. If a piece of wood is to be split with an axe, the axe must of necessity 
<A NAME="292"></A>be hard; and, if hard, must of necessity be made of bronze or iron. Now 
<A NAME="293"></A>exactly in the same way the body, which like the axe is an instrument-for 
<A NAME="294"></A>both the body as a whole and its several parts individually have definite 
<A NAME="295"></A>operations for which they are made-just in the same way, I say, the body, 
<A NAME="296"></A>if it is to do its work, must of necessity be of such and such a character, 
<A NAME="297"></A>and made of such and such materials.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>It is plain then that there are two modes of causation, and that 
<A NAME="299"></A>both of these must, so far as possible, be taken into account in explaining 
<A NAME="300"></A>the works of nature, or that at any rate an attempt must be made to include 
<A NAME="301"></A>them both; and that those who fail in this tell us in reality nothing about 
<A NAME="302"></A>nature. For primary cause constitutes the nature of an animal much more 
<A NAME="303"></A>than does its matter. There are indeed passages in which even Empedocles 
<A NAME="304"></A>hits upon this, and following the guidance of fact, finds himself constrained 
<A NAME="305"></A>to speak of the ratio (olugos) as constituting the essence and real nature 
<A NAME="306"></A>of things. Such, for instance, is the case when he explains what is a bone. 
<A NAME="307"></A>For he does not merely describe its material, and say it is this one element, 
<A NAME="308"></A>or those two or three elements, or a compound of all the elements, but 
<A NAME="309"></A>states the ratio (olugos) of their combination. As with a bone, so manifestly 
<A NAME="310"></A>is it with the flesh and all other similar parts.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>The reason why our predecessors failed in hitting upon this method 
<A NAME="312"></A>of treatment was, that they were not in possession of the notion of essence, 
<A NAME="313"></A>nor of any definition of substance. The first who came near it was Democritus, 
<A NAME="314"></A>and he was far from adopting it as a necessary method in natural science, 
<A NAME="315"></A>but was merely brought to it, spite of himself, by constraint of facts. 
<A NAME="316"></A>In the time of Socrates a nearer approach was made to the method. But at 
<A NAME="317"></A>this period men gave up inquiring into the works of nature, and philosophers 
<A NAME="318"></A>diverted their attention to political science and to the virtues which 
<A NAME="319"></A>benefit mankind.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>Of the method itself the following is an example. In dealing with 
<A NAME="321"></A>respiration we must show that it takes place for such or such a final object; 
<A NAME="322"></A>and we must also show that this and that part of the process is necessitated 
<A NAME="323"></A>by this and that other stage of it. By necessity we shall sometimes mean 
<A NAME="324"></A>hypothetical necessity, the necessity, that is, that the requisite antecedants 
<A NAME="325"></A>shall be there, if the final end is to be reached; and sometimes absolute 
<A NAME="326"></A>necessity, such necessity as that which connects substances and their inherent 
<A NAME="327"></A>properties and characters. For the alternate discharge and re-entrance 
<A NAME="328"></A>of heat and the inflow of air are necessary if we are to live. Here we 
<A NAME="329"></A>have at once a necessity in the former of the two senses. But the alternation 
<A NAME="330"></A>of heat and refrigeration produces of necessity an alternate admission 
<A NAME="331"></A>and discharge of the outer air, and this is a necessity of the second 
<A NAME="332"></A>kind.
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>In the foregoing we have an example of the method which we must 
<A NAME="334"></A>adopt, and also an example of the kind of phenomena, the causes of which 
<A NAME="335"></A>we have to investigate.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="336"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>Some writers propose to reach the definitions of the ultimate forms 
<A NAME="338"></A>of animal life by bipartite division. But this method is often difficult, 
<A NAME="339"></A>and often impracticable.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>Sometimes the final differentia of the subdivision is sufficient 
<A NAME="341"></A>by itself, and the antecedent differentiae are mere surplusage. Thus in 
<A NAME="342"></A>the series Footed, Two-footed, Cleft-footed, the last term is all-expressive 
<A NAME="343"></A>by itself, and to append the higher terms is only an idle iteration. Again 
<A NAME="344"></A>it is not permissible to break up a natural group, Birds for instance, 
<A NAME="345"></A>by putting its members under different bifurcations, as is done in the 
<A NAME="346"></A>published dichotomies, where some birds are ranked with animals of the 
<A NAME="347"></A>water, and others placed in a different class. The group Birds and the 
<A NAME="348"></A>group Fishes happen to be named, while other natural groups have no popular 
<A NAME="349"></A>names; for instance, the groups that we may call Sanguineous and Bloodless 
<A NAME="350"></A>are not known popularly by any designations. If such natural groups are 
<A NAME="351"></A>not to be broken up, the method of Dichotomy cannot be employed, for it 
<A NAME="352"></A>necessarily involves such breaking up and dislocation. The group of the 
<A NAME="353"></A>Many-footed, for instance, would, under this method, have to be dismembered, 
<A NAME="354"></A>and some of its kinds distributed among land animals, others among water 
<A NAME="355"></A>animals.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="356"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>Again, privative terms inevitably form one branch of dichotomous 
<A NAME="358"></A>division, as we see in the proposed dichotomies. But privative terms in 
<A NAME="359"></A>their character of privatives admit of no subdivision. For there can be 
<A NAME="360"></A>no specific forms of a negation, of Featherless for instance or of Footless, 
<A NAME="361"></A>as there are of Feathered and of Footed. Yet a generic differentia must 
<A NAME="362"></A>be subdivisible; for otherwise what is there that makes it generic rather 
<A NAME="363"></A>than specific? There are to be found generic, that is specifically subdivisible, 
<A NAME="364"></A>differentiae; Feathered for instance and Footed. For feathers are divisible 
<A NAME="365"></A>into Barbed and Unbarbed, and feet into Manycleft, and Twocleft, like those 
<A NAME="366"></A>of animals with bifid hoofs, and Uncleft or Undivided, like those of animals 
<A NAME="367"></A>with solid hoofs. Now even with differentiae capable of this specific subdivision 
<A NAME="368"></A>it is difficult enough so to make the classification, as that each animal 
<A NAME="369"></A>shall be comprehended in some one subdivision and in not more than one; 
<A NAME="370"></A>but far more difficult, nay impossible, is it to do this, if we start with 
<A NAME="371"></A>a dichotomy into two contradictories. (Suppose for instance we start with 
<A NAME="372"></A>the two contradictories, Feathered and Unfeathered; we shall find that 
<A NAME="373"></A>the ant, the glow-worm, and some other animals fall under both divisions.) 
<A NAME="374"></A>For each differentia must be presented by some species. There must be some 
<A NAME="375"></A>species, therefore, under the privative heading. Now specifically distinct 
<A NAME="376"></A>animals cannot present in their essence a common undifferentiated element, 
<A NAME="377"></A>but any apparently common element must really be differentiated. (Bird 
<A NAME="378"></A>and Man for instance are both Two-footed, but their two-footedness is diverse 
<A NAME="379"></A>and differentiated. So any two sanguineous groups must have some difference 
<A NAME="380"></A>in their blood, if their blood is part of their essence.) From this it 
<A NAME="381"></A>follows that a privative term, being insusceptible of differentiation, 
<A NAME="382"></A>cannot be a generic differentia; for, if it were, there would be a common 
<A NAME="383"></A>undifferentiated element in two different groups.
<A NAME="384"></A><BR><BR>Again, if the species are ultimate indivisible groups, that is, 
<A NAME="385"></A>are groups with indivisible differentiae, and if no differentia be common 
<A NAME="386"></A>to several groups, the number of differentiae must be equal to the number 
<A NAME="387"></A>of species. If a differentia though not divisible could yet be common to 
<A NAME="388"></A>several groups, then it is plain that in virtue of that common differentia 
<A NAME="389"></A>specifically distinct animals would fall into the same division. It is 
<A NAME="390"></A>necessary then, if the differentiae, under which are ranged all the ultimate 
<A NAME="391"></A>and indivisible groups, are specific characters, that none of them shall 
<A NAME="392"></A>be common; for otherwise, as already said, specifically distinct animals 
<A NAME="393"></A>will come into one and the same division. But this would violate one of 
<A NAME="394"></A>the requisite conditions, which are as follows. No ultimate group must 
<A NAME="395"></A>be included in more than a single division; different groups must not be 
<A NAME="396"></A>included in the same division; and every group must be found in some division. 
<A NAME="397"></A>It is plain then that we cannot get at the ultimate specific forms of the 
<A NAME="398"></A>animal, or any other, kingdom by bifurcate division. If we could, the number 
<A NAME="399"></A>of ultimate differentiae would equal the number of ultimate animal forms. 
<A NAME="400"></A>For assume an order of beings whose prime differentiae are White and Black. 
<A NAME="401"></A>Each of these branches will bifurcate, and their branches again, and so 
<A NAME="402"></A>on till we reach the ultimate differentiae, whose number will be four or 
<A NAME="403"></A>some other power of two, and will also be the number of the ultimate species 
<A NAME="404"></A>comprehended in the order.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>(A species is constituted by the combination differentia and matter. 
<A NAME="406"></A>For no part of an animal is purely material or purely immaterial; nor can 
<A NAME="407"></A>a body, independently of its condition, constitute an animal or any of 
<A NAME="408"></A>its parts, as has repeatedly been observed.)
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>Further, the differentiae must be elements of the essence, and 
<A NAME="410"></A>not merely essential attributes. Thus if Figure is the term to be divided, 
<A NAME="411"></A>it must not be divided into figures whose angles are equal to two right 
<A NAME="412"></A>angles, and figures whose angles are together greater than two right angles. 
<A NAME="413"></A>For it is only an attribute of a triangle and not part of its essence that 
<A NAME="414"></A>its angles are equal to two right angles.
<A NAME="415"></A><BR><BR>Again, the bifurcations must be opposites, like White and Black, 
<A NAME="416"></A>Straight and Bent; and if we characterize one branch by either term, we 
<A NAME="417"></A>must characterize the other by its opposite, and not, for example, characterize 
<A NAME="418"></A>one branch by a colour, the other by a mode of progression, swimming for 
<A NAME="419"></A>instance.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore, living beings cannot be divided by the functions common 
<A NAME="421"></A>to body and soul, by Flying, for instance, and Walking, as we see them 
<A NAME="422"></A>divided in the dichotomies already referred to. For some groups, Ants for 
<A NAME="423"></A>instance, fall under both divisions, some ants flying while others do not. 
<A NAME="424"></A>Similarly as regards the division into Wild and Tame; for it also would 
<A NAME="425"></A>involve the disruption of a species into different groups. For in almost 
<A NAME="426"></A>all species in which some members are tame, there are other members that 
<A NAME="427"></A>are wild. Such, for example, is the case with Men, Horses, Oxen, Dogs in 
<A NAME="428"></A>India, Pigs, Goats, Sheep; groups which, if double, ought to have what 
<A NAME="429"></A>they have not, namely, different appellations; and which, if single, prove 
<A NAME="430"></A>that Wildness and Tameness do not amount to specific differences. And whatever 
<A NAME="431"></A>single element we take as a basis of division the same difficulty will 
<A NAME="432"></A>occur.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>The method then that we must adopt is to attempt to recognize the 
<A NAME="434"></A>natural groups, following the indications afforded by the instincts of 
<A NAME="435"></A>mankind, which led them for instance to form the class of Birds and the 
<A NAME="436"></A>class of Fishes, each of which groups combines a multitude of differentiae, 
<A NAME="437"></A>and is not defined by a single one as in dichotomy. The method of dichotomy 
<A NAME="438"></A>is either impossible (for it would put a single group under different divisions 
<A NAME="439"></A>or contrary groups under the same division), or it only furnishes a single 
<A NAME="440"></A>ultimate differentia for each species, which either alone or with its series 
<A NAME="441"></A>of antecedents has to constitute the ultimate species.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>If, again, a new differential character be introduced at any stage 
<A NAME="443"></A>into the division, the necessary result is that the continuity of the division 
<A NAME="444"></A>becomes merely a unity and continuity of agglomeration, like the unity 
<A NAME="445"></A>and continuity of a series of sentences coupled together by conjunctive 
<A NAME="446"></A>particles. For instance, suppose we have the bifurcation Feathered and 
<A NAME="447"></A>Featherless, and then divide Feathered into Wild and Tame, or into White 
<A NAME="448"></A>and Black. Tame and White are not a differentiation of Feathered, but are 
<A NAME="449"></A>the commencement of an independent bifurcation, and are foreign to the 
<A NAME="450"></A>series at the end of which they are introduced.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>As we said then, we must define at the outset by multiplicity of 
<A NAME="452"></A>differentiae. If we do so, privative terms will be available, which are 
<A NAME="453"></A>unavailable to the dichotomist.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>The impossibility of reaching the definition of any of the ultimate 
<A NAME="455"></A>forms by dichotomy of the larger group, as some propose, is manifest also 
<A NAME="456"></A>from the following considerations. It is impossible that a single differentia, 
<A NAME="457"></A>either by itself or with its antecedents, shall express the whole essence 
<A NAME="458"></A>of a species. (In saying a single differentia by itself I mean such an 
<A NAME="459"></A>isolated differentia as Cleft-footed; in saying a single differentia with 
<A NAME="460"></A>antecedent I mean, to give an instance, Manycleft-footed preceded by Cleft-footed. 
<A NAME="461"></A>The very continuity of a series of successive differentiae in a division 
<A NAME="462"></A>is intended to show that it is their combination that expresses the character 
<A NAME="463"></A>of the resulting unit, or ultimate group. But one is misled by the usages 
<A NAME="464"></A>of language into imagining that it is merely the final term of the series, 
<A NAME="465"></A>Manycleft-footed for instance, that constitutes the whole differentia, 
<A NAME="466"></A>and that the antecedent terms, Footed, Cleft-footed, are superfluous. Now 
<A NAME="467"></A>it is evident that such a series cannot consist of many terms. For if one 
<A NAME="468"></A>divides and subdivides, one soon reaches the final differential term, but 
<A NAME="469"></A>for all that will not have got to the ultimate division, that is, to the 
<A NAME="470"></A>species.) No single differentia, I repeat, either by itself or with its 
<A NAME="471"></A>antecedents, can possibly express the essence of a species. Suppose, for 
<A NAME="472"></A>example, Man to be the animal to be defined; the single differentia will 
<A NAME="473"></A>be Cleft-footed, either by itself or with its antecedents, Footed and Two-footed. 
<A NAME="474"></A>Now if man was nothing more than a Cleft-footed animal, this single differentia 
<A NAME="475"></A>would duly represent his essence. But seeing that this is not the case, 
<A NAME="476"></A>more differentiae than this one will necessarily be required to define 
<A NAME="477"></A>him; and these cannot come under one division; for each single branch of 
<A NAME="478"></A>a dichotomy ends in a single differentia, and cannot possibly include several 
<A NAME="479"></A>differentiae belonging to one and the same animal.
<A NAME="480"></A><BR><BR>It is impossible then to reach any of the ultimate animal forms 
<A NAME="481"></A>by dichotomous division.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="482"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>It deserves inquiry why a single name denoting a higher group was 
<A NAME="484"></A>not invented by mankind, as an appellation to comprehend the two groups 
<A NAME="485"></A>of Water animals and Winged animals. For even these have certain attributes 
<A NAME="486"></A>in common. However, the present nomenclature is just. Groups that only 
<A NAME="487"></A>differ in degree, and in the more or less of an identical element that 
<A NAME="488"></A>they possess, are aggregated under a single class; groups whose attributes 
<A NAME="489"></A>are not identical but analogous are separated. For instance, bird differs 
<A NAME="490"></A>from bird by gradation, or by excess and defect; some birds have long feathers, 
<A NAME="491"></A>others short ones, but all are feathered. Bird and Fish are more remote 
<A NAME="492"></A>and only agree in having analogous organs; for what in the bird is feather, 
<A NAME="493"></A>in the fish is scale. Such analogies can scarcely, however, serve universally 
<A NAME="494"></A>as indications for the formation of groups, for almost all animals present 
<A NAME="495"></A>analogies in their corresponding parts.
<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>The individuals comprised within a species, such as Socrates and 
<A NAME="497"></A>Coriscus, are the real existences; but inasmuch as these individuals possess 
<A NAME="498"></A>one common specific form, it will suffice to state the universal attributes 
<A NAME="499"></A>of the species, that is, the attributes common to all its individuals, 
<A NAME="500"></A>once for all, as otherwise there will be endless reiteration, as has already 
<A NAME="501"></A>been pointed out.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>But as regards the larger groups-such as Birds-which comprehend 
<A NAME="503"></A>many species, there may be a question. For on the one hand it may be urged 
<A NAME="504"></A>that as the ultimate species represent the real existences, it will be 
<A NAME="505"></A>well, if practicable, to examine these ultimate species separately, just 
<A NAME="506"></A>as we examine the species Man separately; to examine, that is, not the 
<A NAME="507"></A>whole class Birds collectively, but the Ostrich, the Crane, and the other 
<A NAME="508"></A>indivisible groups or species belonging to the class.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>On the other hand, however, this course would involve repeated 
<A NAME="510"></A>mention of the same attribute, as the same attribute is common to many 
<A NAME="511"></A>species, and so far would be somewhat irrational and tedious. Perhaps, 
<A NAME="512"></A>then, it will be best to treat generically the universal attributes of 
<A NAME="513"></A>the groups that have a common nature and contain closely allied subordinate 
<A NAME="514"></A>forms, whether they are groups recognized by a true instinct of mankind, 
<A NAME="515"></A>such as Birds and Fishes, or groups not popularly known by a common appellation, 
<A NAME="516"></A>but withal composed of closely allied subordinate groups; and only to deal 
<A NAME="517"></A>individually with the attributes of a single species, when such species, 
<A NAME="518"></A>man, for instance, and any other such, if such there be-stands apart from 
<A NAME="519"></A>others, and does not constitute with them a larger natural 
<A NAME="520"></A>group.
<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>It is generally similarity in the shape of particular organs, or 
<A NAME="522"></A>of the whole body, that has determined the formation of the larger groups. 
<A NAME="523"></A>It is in virtue of such a similarity that Birds, Fishes, Cephalopoda, and 
<A NAME="524"></A>Testacea have been made to form each a separate class. For within the limits 
<A NAME="525"></A>of each such class, the parts do not differ in that they have no nearer 
<A NAME="526"></A>resemblance than that of analogy-such as exists between the bone of man 
<A NAME="527"></A>and the spine of fish-but differ merely in respect of such corporeal conditions 
<A NAME="528"></A>as largeness smallness, softness hardness, smoothness roughness, and other 
<A NAME="529"></A>similar oppositions, or, in one word, in respect of 
<A NAME="530"></A>degree.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>We have now touched upon the canons for criticizing the method 
<A NAME="532"></A>of natural science, and have considered what is the most systematic and 
<A NAME="533"></A>easy course of investigation; we have also dealt with division, and the 
<A NAME="534"></A>mode of conducting it so as best to attain the ends of science, and have 
<A NAME="535"></A>shown why dichotomy is either impracticable or inefficacious for its professed 
<A NAME="536"></A>purposes.
<A NAME="537"></A><BR><BR>Having laid this foundation, let us pass on to our next 
<A NAME="538"></A>topic.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="539"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>Of things constituted by nature some are ungenerated, imperishable, 
<A NAME="541"></A>and eternal, while others are subject to generation and decay. The former 
<A NAME="542"></A>are excellent beyond compare and divine, but less accessible to knowledge. 
<A NAME="543"></A>The evidence that might throw light on them, and on the problems which 
<A NAME="544"></A>we long to solve respecting them, is furnished but scantily by sensation; 
<A NAME="545"></A>whereas respecting perishable plants and animals we have abundant information, 
<A NAME="546"></A>living as we do in their midst, and ample data may be collected concerning 
<A NAME="547"></A>all their various kinds, if only we are willing to take sufficient pains. 
<A NAME="548"></A>Both departments, however, have their special charm. The scanty conceptions 
<A NAME="549"></A>to which we can attain of celestial things give us, from their excellence, 
<A NAME="550"></A>more pleasure than all our knowledge of the world in which we live; just 
<A NAME="551"></A>as a half glimpse of persons that we love is more delightful than a leisurely 
<A NAME="552"></A>view of other things, whatever their number and dimensions. On the other 
<A NAME="553"></A>hand, in certitude and in completeness our knowledge of terrestrial things 
<A NAME="554"></A>has the advantage. Moreover, their greater nearness and affinity to us 
<A NAME="555"></A>balances somewhat the loftier interest of the heavenly things that are 
<A NAME="556"></A>the objects of the higher philosophy. Having already treated of the celestial 
<A NAME="557"></A>world, as far as our conjectures could reach, we proceed to treat of animals, 
<A NAME="558"></A>without omitting, to the best of our ability, any member of the kingdom, 
<A NAME="559"></A>however ignoble. For if some have no graces to charm the sense, yet even 
<A NAME="560"></A>these, by disclosing to intellectual perception the artistic spirit that 
<A NAME="561"></A>designed them, give immense pleasure to all who can trace links of causation, 
<A NAME="562"></A>and are inclined to philosophy. Indeed, it would be strange if mimic representations 
<A NAME="563"></A>of them were attractive, because they disclose the mimetic skill of the 
<A NAME="564"></A>painter or sculptor, and the original realities themselves were not more 
<A NAME="565"></A>interesting, to all at any rate who have eyes to discern the reasons that 
<A NAME="566"></A>determined their formation. We therefore must not recoil with childish 
<A NAME="567"></A>aversion from the examination of the humbler animals. Every realm of nature 
<A NAME="568"></A>is marvellous: and as Heraclitus, when the strangers who came to visit 
<A NAME="569"></A>him found him warming himself at the furnace in the kitchen and hesitated 
<A NAME="570"></A>to go in, reported to have bidden them not to be afraid to enter, as even 
<A NAME="571"></A>in that kitchen divinities were present, so we should venture on the study 
<A NAME="572"></A>of every kind of animal without distaste; for each and all will reveal 
<A NAME="573"></A>to us something natural and something beautiful. Absence of haphazard and 
<A NAME="574"></A>conduciveness of everything to an end are to be found in Nature's works 
<A NAME="575"></A>in the highest degree, and the resultant end of her generations and combinations 
<A NAME="576"></A>is a form of the beautiful.
<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR>If any person thinks the examination of the rest of the animal 
<A NAME="578"></A>kingdom an unworthy task, he must hold in like disesteem the study of man. 
<A NAME="579"></A>For no one can look at the primordia of the human frame-blood, flesh, bones, 
<A NAME="580"></A>vessels, and the like-without much repugnance. Moreover, when any one of 
<A NAME="581"></A>the parts or structures, be it which it may, is under discussion, it must 
<A NAME="582"></A>not be supposed that it is its material composition to which attention 
<A NAME="583"></A>is being directed or which is the object of the discussion, but the relation 
<A NAME="584"></A>of such part to the total form. Similarly, the true object of architecture 
<A NAME="585"></A>is not bricks, mortar, or timber, but the house; and so the principal object 
<A NAME="586"></A>of natural philosophy is not the material elements, but their composition, 
<A NAME="587"></A>and the totality of the form, independently of which they have no 
<A NAME="588"></A>existence.
<A NAME="589"></A><BR><BR>The course of exposition must be first to state the attributes 
<A NAME="590"></A>common to whole groups of animals, and then to attempt to give their explanation. 
<A NAME="591"></A>Many groups, as already noticed, present common attributes, that is to 
<A NAME="592"></A>say, in some cases absolutely identical affections, and absolutely identical 
<A NAME="593"></A>organs,-feet, feathers, scales, and the like-while in other groups the 
<A NAME="594"></A>affections and organs are only so far identical as that they are analogous. 
<A NAME="595"></A>For instance, some groups have lungs, others have no lung, but an organ 
<A NAME="596"></A>analogous to a lung in its place; some have blood, others have no blood, 
<A NAME="597"></A>but a fluid analogous to blood, and with the same office. To treat of the 
<A NAME="598"></A>common attributes in connexion with each individual group would involve, 
<A NAME="599"></A>as already suggested, useless iteration. For many groups have common attributes. 
<A NAME="600"></A>So much for this topic.
<A NAME="601"></A><BR><BR>As every instrument and every bodily member subserves some partial 
<A NAME="602"></A>end, that is to say, some special action, so the whole body must be destined 
<A NAME="603"></A>to minister to some Plenary sphere of action. Thus the saw is made for 
<A NAME="604"></A>sawing, for sawing is a function, and not sawing for the saw. Similarly, 
<A NAME="605"></A>the body too must somehow or other be made for the soul, and each part 
<A NAME="606"></A>of it for some subordinate function, to which it is 
<A NAME="607"></A>adapted.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>We have, then, first to describe the common functions, common, 
<A NAME="609"></A>that is, to the whole animal kingdom, or to certain large groups, or to 
<A NAME="610"></A>the members of a species. In other words, we have to describe the attributes 
<A NAME="611"></A>common to all animals, or to assemblages, like the class of Birds, of closely 
<A NAME="612"></A>allied groups differentiated by gradation, or to groups like Man not differentiated 
<A NAME="613"></A>into subordinate groups. In the first case the common attributes may be 
<A NAME="614"></A>called analogous, in the second generic, in the third 
<A NAME="615"></A>specific.
<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>When a function is ancillary to another, a like relation manifestly 
<A NAME="617"></A>obtains between the organs which discharge these functions; and similarly, 
<A NAME="618"></A>if one function is prior to and the end of another, their respective organs 
<A NAME="619"></A>will stand to each other in the same relation. Thirdly, the existence of 
<A NAME="620"></A>these parts involves that of other things as their necessary 
<A NAME="621"></A>consequents.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>Instances of what I mean by functions and affections are Reproduction, 
<A NAME="623"></A>Growth, Copulation, Waking, Sleep, Locomotion, and other similar vital 
<A NAME="624"></A>actions. Instances of what I mean by parts are Nose, Eye, Face, and other 
<A NAME="625"></A>so-called members or limbs, and also the more elementary parts of which 
<A NAME="626"></A>these are made. So much for the method to be pursued. Let us now try to 
<A NAME="627"></A>set forth the causes of all vital phenomena, whether universal or particular, 
<A NAME="628"></A>and in so doing let us follow that order of exposition which conforms, 
<A NAME="629"></A>as we have indicated, to the order of nature.
