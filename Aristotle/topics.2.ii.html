<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Of problems some are universal, others particular. Universal problems are 
<A NAME="12"></A>such as 'Every pleasure is good' and 'No pleasure is good'; particular 
<A NAME="13"></A>problems are such as 'Some pleasure is good' and 'Some pleasure is not 
<A NAME="14"></A>good'. The methods of establishing and overthrowing a view universally 
<A NAME="15"></A>are common to both kinds of problems; for when we have shown that a predicate 
<A NAME="16"></A>belongs in every case, we shall also have shown that it belongs in some 
<A NAME="17"></A>cases. Likewise, also, if we show that it does not belong in any case, 
<A NAME="18"></A>we shall also have shown that it does not belong in every case. First, 
<A NAME="19"></A>then, we must speak of the methods of overthrowing a view universally, 
<A NAME="20"></A>because such are common to both universal and particular problems, and 
<A NAME="21"></A>because people more usually introduce theses asserting a predicate than 
<A NAME="22"></A>denying it, while those who argue with them overthrow it. The conversion 
<A NAME="23"></A>of an appropriate name which is drawn from the element 'accident' is an 
<A NAME="24"></A>extremely precarious thing; for in the case of accidents and in no other 
<A NAME="25"></A>it is possible for something to be true conditionally and not universally. 
<A NAME="26"></A>Names drawn from the elements 'definition' and 'property' and 'genus' are 
<A NAME="27"></A>bound to be convertible; e.g. if 'to be an animal that walks on two feet 
<A NAME="28"></A>is an attribute of S', then it will be true by conversion to say that 'S 
<A NAME="29"></A>is an animal that walks on two feet'. Likewise, also, if drawn from the 
<A NAME="30"></A>genus; for if 'to be an animal is an attribute of S', then 'S is an animal'. 
<A NAME="31"></A>The same is true also in the case of a property; for if 'to be capable 
<A NAME="32"></A>of learning grammar is an attribute of S', then 'S will be capable of learning 
<A NAME="33"></A>grammar'. For none of these attributes can possibly belong or not belong 
<A NAME="34"></A>in part; they must either belong or not belong absolutely. In the case 
<A NAME="35"></A>of accidents, on the other hand, there is nothing to prevent an attribute 
<A NAME="36"></A>(e.g. whiteness or justice) belonging in part, so that it is not enough 
<A NAME="37"></A>to show that whiteness or justice is an attribute of a man in order to 
<A NAME="38"></A>show that he is white or just; for it is open to dispute it and say that 
<A NAME="39"></A>he is white or just in part only. Conversion, then, is not a necessary 
<A NAME="40"></A>process in the case of accidents.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>We must also define the errors that occur in problems. They are 
<A NAME="42"></A>of two kinds, caused either by false statement or by transgression of the 
<A NAME="43"></A>established diction. For those who make false statements, and say that 
<A NAME="44"></A>an attribute belongs to thing which does not belong to it, commit error; 
<A NAME="45"></A>and those who call objects by the names of other objects (e.g. calling 
<A NAME="46"></A>a planetree a 'man') transgress the established terminology.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="47"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>Now one commonplace rule is to look and see if a man has ascribed 
<A NAME="49"></A>as an accident what belongs in some other way. This mistake is most commonly 
<A NAME="50"></A>made in regard to the genera of things, e.g. if one were to say that white 
<A NAME="51"></A>happens (accidit) to be a colour-for being a colour does not happen by 
<A NAME="52"></A>accident to white, but colour is its genus. The assertor may of course 
<A NAME="53"></A>define it so in so many words, saying (e.g.) that 'Justice happens (accidit) 
<A NAME="54"></A>to be a virtue'; but often even without such definition it is obvious that 
<A NAME="55"></A>he has rendered the genus as an accident; e.g. suppose that one were to 
<A NAME="56"></A>say that whiteness is coloured or that walking is in motion. For a predicate 
<A NAME="57"></A>drawn from the genus is never ascribed to the species in an inflected form, 
<A NAME="58"></A>but always the genera are predicated of their species literally; for the 
<A NAME="59"></A>species take on both the name and the definition of their genera. A man 
<A NAME="60"></A>therefore who says that white is 'coloured' has not rendered 'coloured' 
<A NAME="61"></A>as its genus, seeing that he has used an inflected form, nor yet as its 
<A NAME="62"></A>property or as its definition: for the definition and property of a thing 
<A NAME="63"></A>belong to it and to nothing else, whereas many things besides white are 
<A NAME="64"></A>coloured, e.g. a log, a stone, a man, and a horse. Clearly then he renders 
<A NAME="65"></A>it as an accident.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>Another rule is to examine all cases where a predicate has been 
<A NAME="67"></A>either asserted or denied universally to belong to something. Look at them 
<A NAME="68"></A>species by species, and not in their infinite multitude: for then the inquiry 
<A NAME="69"></A>will proceed more directly and in fewer steps. You should look and begin 
<A NAME="70"></A>with the most primary groups, and then proceed in order down to those that 
<A NAME="71"></A>are not further divisible: e.g. if a man has said that the knowledge of 
<A NAME="72"></A>opposites is the same, you should look and see whether it be so of relative 
<A NAME="73"></A>opposites and of contraries and of terms signifying the privation or presence 
<A NAME="74"></A>of certain states, and of contradictory terms. Then, if no clear result 
<A NAME="75"></A>be reached so far in these cases, you should again divide these until you 
<A NAME="76"></A>come to those that are not further divisible, and see (e.g.) whether it 
<A NAME="77"></A>be so of just deeds and unjust, or of the double and the half, or of blindness 
<A NAME="78"></A>and sight, or of being and not-being: for if in any case it be shown that 
<A NAME="79"></A>the knowledge of them is not the same we shall have demolished the problem. 
<A NAME="80"></A>Likewise, also, if the predicate belongs in no case. This rule is convertible 
<A NAME="81"></A>for both destructive and constructive purposes: for if, when we have suggested 
<A NAME="82"></A>a division, the predicate appears to hold in all or in a large number of 
<A NAME="83"></A>cases, we may then claim that the other should actually assert it universally, 
<A NAME="84"></A>or else bring a negative instance to show in what case it is not so: for 
<A NAME="85"></A>if he does neither of these things, a refusal to assert it will make him 
<A NAME="86"></A>look absurd.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>Another rule is to make definitions both of an accident and of 
<A NAME="88"></A>its subject, either of both separately or else of one of them, and then 
<A NAME="89"></A>look and see if anything untrue has been assumed as true in the definitions. 
<A NAME="90"></A>Thus (e.g.) to see if it is possible to wrong a god, ask what is 'to wrong'? 
<A NAME="91"></A>For if it be 'to injure deliberately', clearly it is not possible for a 
<A NAME="92"></A>god to be wronged: for it is impossible that God should be injured. Again, 
<A NAME="93"></A>to see if the good man is jealous, ask who is the 'jealous' man and what 
<A NAME="94"></A>is 'jealousy'. For if 'jealousy' is pain at the apparent success of some 
<A NAME="95"></A>well-behaved person, clearly the good man is not jealous: for then he would 
<A NAME="96"></A>be bad. Again, to see if the indignant man is jealous, ask who each of 
<A NAME="97"></A>them is: for then it will be obvious whether the statement is true or false; 
<A NAME="98"></A>e.g. if he is 'jealous' who grieves at the successes of the good, and he 
<A NAME="99"></A>is 'indignant' who grieves at the successes of the evil, then clearly the 
<A NAME="100"></A>indignant man would not be jealous. A man should substitute definitions 
<A NAME="101"></A>also for the terms contained in his definitions, and not stop until he 
<A NAME="102"></A>comes to a familiar term: for often if the definition be rendered whole, 
<A NAME="103"></A>the point at issue is not cleared up, whereas if for one of the terms used 
<A NAME="104"></A>in the definition a definition be stated, it becomes 
<A NAME="105"></A>obvious.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, a man should make the problem into a proposition for 
<A NAME="107"></A>himself, and then bring a negative instance against it: for the negative 
<A NAME="108"></A>instance will be a ground of attack upon the assertion. This rule is very 
<A NAME="109"></A>nearly the same as the rule to look into cases where a predicate has been 
<A NAME="110"></A>attributed or denied universally: but it differs in the turn of the 
<A NAME="111"></A>argument.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, you should define what kind of things should be called 
<A NAME="113"></A>as most men call them, and what should not. For this is useful both for 
<A NAME="114"></A>establishing and for overthrowing a view: e.g. you should say that we ought 
<A NAME="115"></A>to use our terms to mean the same things as most people mean by them, but 
<A NAME="116"></A>when we ask what kind of things are or are not of such and such a kind, 
<A NAME="117"></A>we should not here go with the multitude: e.g. it is right to call 'healthy' 
<A NAME="118"></A>whatever tends to produce health, as do most men: but in saying whether 
<A NAME="119"></A>the object before us tends to produce health or not, we should adopt the 
<A NAME="120"></A>language no longer of the multitude but of the doctor.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="121"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, if a term be used in several senses, and it has been 
<A NAME="123"></A>laid down that it is or that it is not an attribute of S, you should show 
<A NAME="124"></A>your case of one of its several senses, if you cannot show it of both. 
<A NAME="125"></A>This rule is to be observed in cases where the difference of meaning is 
<A NAME="126"></A>undetected; for supposing this to be obvious, then the other man will object 
<A NAME="127"></A>that the point which he himself questioned has not been discussed, but 
<A NAME="128"></A>only the other point. This commonplace rule is convertible for purposes 
<A NAME="129"></A>both of establishing and of overthrowing a view. For if we want to establish 
<A NAME="130"></A>a statement, we shall show that in one sense the attribute belongs, if 
<A NAME="131"></A>we cannot show it of both senses: whereas if we are overthrowing a statement, 
<A NAME="132"></A>we shall show that in one sense the attribute does not belong, if we cannot 
<A NAME="133"></A>show it of both senses. Of course, in overthrowing a statement there is 
<A NAME="134"></A>no need to start the discussion by securing any admission, either when 
<A NAME="135"></A>the statement asserts or when it denies the attribute universally: for 
<A NAME="136"></A>if we show that in any case whatever the attribute does not belong, we 
<A NAME="137"></A>shall have demolished the universal assertion of it, and likewise also 
<A NAME="138"></A>if we show that it belongs in a single case, we shall demolish the universal 
<A NAME="139"></A>denial of it. Whereas in establishing a statement we ought to secure a 
<A NAME="140"></A>preliminary admission that if it belongs in any case whatever, it belongs 
<A NAME="141"></A>universally, supposing this claim to be a plausible one. For it is not 
<A NAME="142"></A>enough to discuss a single instance in order to show that an attribute 
<A NAME="143"></A>belongs universally; e.g. to argue that if the soul of man be immortal, 
<A NAME="144"></A>then every soul is immortal, so that a previous admission must be secured 
<A NAME="145"></A>that if any soul whatever be immortal, then every soul is immortal. This 
<A NAME="146"></A>is not to be done in every case, but only whenever we are not easily able 
<A NAME="147"></A>to quote any single argument applying to all cases in common, as (e.g.) 
<A NAME="148"></A>the geometrician can argue that the triangle has its angles equal to two 
<A NAME="149"></A>right angles.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>If, again, the variety of meanings of a term be obvious, distinguish 
<A NAME="151"></A>how many meanings it has before proceeding either to demolish or to establish 
<A NAME="152"></A>it: e.g. supposing 'the right' to mean 'the expedient' or 'the honourable', 
<A NAME="153"></A>you should try either to establish or to demolish both descriptions of 
<A NAME="154"></A>the subject in question; e.g. by showing that it is honourable and expedient, 
<A NAME="155"></A>or that it is neither honourable nor expedient. Supposing, however, that 
<A NAME="156"></A>it is impossible to show both, you should show the one, adding an indication 
<A NAME="157"></A>that it is true in the one sense and not in the other. The same rule applies 
<A NAME="158"></A>also when the number of senses into which it is divided is more than 
<A NAME="159"></A>two.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>Again, consider those expressions whose meanings are many, but 
<A NAME="161"></A>differ not by way of ambiguity of a term, but in some other way: e.g. 'The 
<A NAME="162"></A>science of many things is one': here 'many things' may mean the end and 
<A NAME="163"></A>the means to that end, as (e.g.) medicine is the science both of producing 
<A NAME="164"></A>health and of dieting; or they may be both of them ends, as the science 
<A NAME="165"></A>of contraries is said to be the same (for of contraries the one is no more 
<A NAME="166"></A>an end than the other); or again they may be an essential and an accidental 
<A NAME="167"></A>attribute, as (e.g.) the essential fact that the triangle has its angles 
<A NAME="168"></A>equal to two right angles, and the accidental fact that the equilateral 
<A NAME="169"></A>figure has them so: for it is because of the accident of the equilateral 
<A NAME="170"></A>triangle happening to be a triangle that we know that it has its angles 
<A NAME="171"></A>equal to two right angles. If, then, it is not possible in any sense of 
<A NAME="172"></A>the term that the science of many things should be the same, it clearly 
<A NAME="173"></A>is altogether impossible that it should be so; or, if it is possible in 
<A NAME="174"></A>some sense, then clearly it is possible. Distinguish as many meanings as 
<A NAME="175"></A>are required: e.g. if we want to establish a view, we should bring forward 
<A NAME="176"></A>all such meanings as admit that view and should divide them only into those 
<A NAME="177"></A>meanings which also are required for the establishment of our case: whereas 
<A NAME="178"></A>if we want to overthrow a view, we should bring forward all that do not 
<A NAME="179"></A>admit that view, and leave the rest aside. We must deal also in these cases 
<A NAME="180"></A>as well with any uncertainty about the number of meanings involved. Further, 
<A NAME="181"></A>that one thing is, or is not, 'of' another should be established by means 
<A NAME="182"></A>of the same commonplace rules; e.g. that a particular science is of a particular 
<A NAME="183"></A>thing, treated either as an end or as a means to its end, or as accidentally 
<A NAME="184"></A>connected with it; or again that it is not 'of' it in any of the aforesaid 
<A NAME="185"></A>ways. The same rule holds true also of desire and all other terms that 
<A NAME="186"></A>have more than one object. For the 'desire of X' may mean the desire of 
<A NAME="187"></A>it as an end (e.g. the desire of health) or as a means to an end (e.g. 
<A NAME="188"></A>the desire of being doctored), or as a thing desired accidentally, as, 
<A NAME="189"></A>in the case of wine, the sweet-toothed person desires it not because it 
<A NAME="190"></A>is wine but because it is sweet. For essentially he desires the sweet, 
<A NAME="191"></A>and only accidentally the wine: for if it be dry, he no longer desires 
<A NAME="192"></A>it. His desire for it is therefore accidental. This rule is useful in dealing 
<A NAME="193"></A>with relative terms: for cases of this kind are generally cases of relative 
<A NAME="194"></A>terms.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="195"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, it is well to alter a term into one more familiar, e.g. 
<A NAME="197"></A>to substitute 'clear' for 'exact' in describing a conception, and 'being 
<A NAME="198"></A>fussy' for 'being busy': for when the expression is made more familiar, 
<A NAME="199"></A>the thesis becomes easier to attack. This commonplace rule also is available 
<A NAME="200"></A>for both purposes alike, both for establishing and for overthrowing a 
<A NAME="201"></A>view.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>In order to show that contrary attributes belong to the same thing, 
<A NAME="203"></A>look at its genus; e.g. if we want to show that rightness and wrongness 
<A NAME="204"></A>are possible in regard to perception, and to perceive is to judge, while 
<A NAME="205"></A>it is possible to judge rightly or wrongly, then in regard to perception 
<A NAME="206"></A>as well rightness and wrongness must be possible. In the present instance 
<A NAME="207"></A>the proof proceeds from the genus and relates to the species: for 'to judge' 
<A NAME="208"></A>is the genus of 'to -perceive'; for the man who perceives judges in a certain 
<A NAME="209"></A>way. But per contra it may proceed from the species to the genus: for all 
<A NAME="210"></A>the attributes that belong to the species belong to the genus as well; 
<A NAME="211"></A>e.g. if there is a bad and a good knowledge there is also a bad and a good 
<A NAME="212"></A>disposition: for 'disposition' is the genus of knowledge. Now the former 
<A NAME="213"></A>commonplace argument is fallacious for purposes of establishing a view, 
<A NAME="214"></A>while the second is true. For there is no necessity that all the attributes 
<A NAME="215"></A>that belong to the genus should belong also to the species; for 'animal' 
<A NAME="216"></A>is flying and quadruped, but not so 'man'. All the attributes, on the other 
<A NAME="217"></A>hand, that belong to the species must of necessity belong also to the genus; 
<A NAME="218"></A>for if 'man' is good, then animal also is good. On the other hand, for 
<A NAME="219"></A>purposes of overthrowing a view, the former argument is true while the 
<A NAME="220"></A>latter is fallacious; for all the attributes which do not belong to the 
<A NAME="221"></A>genus do not belong to the species either; whereas all those that are wanting 
<A NAME="222"></A>to the species are not of necessity wanting to the genus.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>Since those things of which the genus is predicated must also of 
<A NAME="224"></A>necessity have one of its species predicated of them, and since those things 
<A NAME="225"></A>that are possessed of the genus in question, or are described by terms 
<A NAME="226"></A>derived from that genus, must also of necessity be possessed of one of 
<A NAME="227"></A>its species or be described by terms derived from one of its species (e.g. 
<A NAME="228"></A>if to anything the term 'scientific knowledge' be applied, then also there 
<A NAME="229"></A>will be applied to it the term 'grammatical' or 'musical' knowledge, or 
<A NAME="230"></A>knowledge of one of the other sciences; and if any one possesses scientific 
<A NAME="231"></A>knowledge or is described by a term derived from 'science', then he will 
<A NAME="232"></A>also possess grammatical or musical knowledge or knowledge of one of the 
<A NAME="233"></A>other sciences, or will be described by a term derived from one of them, 
<A NAME="234"></A>e.g. as a 'grammarian' or a 'musician')-therefore if any expression be 
<A NAME="235"></A>asserted that is in any way derived from the genus (e.g. that the soul 
<A NAME="236"></A>is in motion), look and see whether it be possible for the soul to be moved 
<A NAME="237"></A>with any of the species of motion; whether (e.g.) it can grow or be destroyed 
<A NAME="238"></A>or come to be, and so forth with all the other species of motion. For if 
<A NAME="239"></A>it be not moved in any of these ways, clearly it does not move at all. 
<A NAME="240"></A>This commonplace rule is common for both purposes, both for overthrowing 
<A NAME="241"></A>and for establishing a view: for if the soul moves with one of the species 
<A NAME="242"></A>of motion, clearly it does move; while if it does not move with any of 
<A NAME="243"></A>the species of motion, clearly it does not move.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>If you are not well equipped with an argument against the assertion, 
<A NAME="245"></A>look among the definitions, real or apparent, of the thing before you, 
<A NAME="246"></A>and if one is not enough, draw upon several. For it will be easier to attack 
<A NAME="247"></A>people when committed to a definition: for an attack is always more easily 
<A NAME="248"></A>made on definitions.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, look and see in regard to the thing in question, what 
<A NAME="250"></A>it is whose reality conditions the reality of the thing in question, or 
<A NAME="251"></A>what it is whose reality necessarily follows if the thing in question be 
<A NAME="252"></A>real: if you wish to establish a view inquire what there is on whose reality 
<A NAME="253"></A>the reality of the thing in question will follow (for if the former be 
<A NAME="254"></A>shown to be real, then the thing in question will also have been shown 
<A NAME="255"></A>to be real); while if you want to overthrow a view, ask what it is that 
<A NAME="256"></A>is real if the thing in question be real, for if we show that what follows 
<A NAME="257"></A>from the thing in question is unreal, we shall have demolished the thing 
<A NAME="258"></A>in question.
<A NAME="259"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, look at the time involved, to see if there be any discrepancy 
<A NAME="260"></A>anywhere: e.g. suppose a man to have stated that what is being nourished 
<A NAME="261"></A>of necessity grows: for animals are always of necessity being nourished, 
<A NAME="262"></A>but they do not always grow. Likewise, also, if he has said that knowing 
<A NAME="263"></A>is remembering: for the one is concerned with past time, whereas the other 
<A NAME="264"></A>has to do also with the present and the future. For we are said to know 
<A NAME="265"></A>things present and future (e.g. that there will be an eclipse), whereas 
<A NAME="266"></A>it is impossible to remember anything save what is in the 
<A NAME="267"></A>past.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="268"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, there is the sophistic turn of argument, whereby we draw 
<A NAME="270"></A>our opponent into the kind of statement against which we shall be well 
<A NAME="271"></A>supplied with lines of argument. This process is sometimes a real necessity, 
<A NAME="272"></A>sometimes an apparent necessity, sometimes neither an apparent nor a real 
<A NAME="273"></A>necessity. It is really necessary whenever the answerer has denied any 
<A NAME="274"></A>view that would be useful in attacking the thesis, and the questioner thereupon 
<A NAME="275"></A>addresses his arguments to the support of this view, and when moreover 
<A NAME="276"></A>the view in question happens to be one of a kind on which he has a good 
<A NAME="277"></A>stock of lines of argument. Likewise, also, it is really necessary whenever 
<A NAME="278"></A>he (the questioner) first, by an induction made by means of the view laid 
<A NAME="279"></A>down, arrives at a certain statement and then tries to demolish that statement: 
<A NAME="280"></A>for when once this has been demolished, the view originally laid down is 
<A NAME="281"></A>demolished as well. It is an apparent necessity, when the point to which 
<A NAME="282"></A>the discussion comes to be directed appears to be useful, and relevant 
<A NAME="283"></A>to the thesis, without being really so; whether it be that the man who 
<A NAME="284"></A>is standing up to the argument has refused to concede something, or whether 
<A NAME="285"></A>he (the questioner) has first reached it by a plausible induction based 
<A NAME="286"></A>upon the thesis and then tries to demolish it. The remaining case is when 
<A NAME="287"></A>the point to which the discussion comes to be directed is neither really 
<A NAME="288"></A>nor apparently necessary, and it is the answerer's luck to be confuted 
<A NAME="289"></A>on a mere side issue You should beware of the last of the aforesaid methods; 
<A NAME="290"></A>for it appears to be wholly disconnected from, and foreign to, the art 
<A NAME="291"></A>of dialectic. For this reason, moreover, the answerer should not lose his 
<A NAME="292"></A>temper, but assent to those statements that are of no use in attacking 
<A NAME="293"></A>the thesis, adding an indication whenever he assents although he does not 
<A NAME="294"></A>agree with the view. For, as a rule, it increases the confusion of questioners 
<A NAME="295"></A>if, after all propositions of this kind have been granted them, they can 
<A NAME="296"></A>then draw no conclusion.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, any one who has made any statement whatever has in a 
<A NAME="298"></A>certain sense made several statements, inasmuch as each statement has a 
<A NAME="299"></A>number of necessary consequences: e.g. the man who said 'X is a man' has 
<A NAME="300"></A>also said that it is an animal and that it is animate and a biped and capable 
<A NAME="301"></A>of acquiring reason and knowledge, so that by the demolition of any single 
<A NAME="302"></A>one of these consequences, of whatever kind, the original statement is 
<A NAME="303"></A>demolished as well. But you should beware here too of making a change to 
<A NAME="304"></A>a more difficult subject: for sometimes the consequence, and sometimes 
<A NAME="305"></A>the original thesis, is the easier to demolish.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="306"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>In regard to subjects which must have one and one only of two predicates, 
<A NAME="308"></A>as (e.g.) a man must have either a disease or health, supposing we are 
<A NAME="309"></A>well supplied as regards the one for arguing its presence or absence, we 
<A NAME="310"></A>shall be well equipped as regards the remaining one as well. This rule 
<A NAME="311"></A>is convertible for both purposes: for when we have shown that the one attribute 
<A NAME="312"></A>belongs, we shall have shown that the remaining one does not belong; while 
<A NAME="313"></A>if we show that the one does not belong, we shall have shown that the remaining 
<A NAME="314"></A>one does belong. Clearly then the rule is useful for both 
<A NAME="315"></A>purposes.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, you may devise a line of attack by reinterpreting a term 
<A NAME="317"></A>in its literal meaning, with the implication that it is most fitting so 
<A NAME="318"></A>to take it rather than in its established meaning: e.g. the expression 
<A NAME="319"></A>'strong at heart' will suggest not the courageous man, according to the 
<A NAME="320"></A>use now established, but the man the state of whose heart is strong; just 
<A NAME="321"></A>as also the expression 'of a good hope' may be taken to mean the man who 
<A NAME="322"></A>hopes for good things. Likewise also 'well-starred' may be taken to mean 
<A NAME="323"></A>the man whose star is good, as Xenocrates says 'well-starred is he who 
<A NAME="324"></A>has a noble soul'.' For a man's star is his soul.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>Some things occur of necessity, others usually, others however 
<A NAME="326"></A>it may chance; if therefore a necessary event has been asserted to occur 
<A NAME="327"></A>usually, or if a usual event (or, failing such an event itself, its contrary) 
<A NAME="328"></A>has been stated to occur of necessity, it always gives an opportunity for 
<A NAME="329"></A>attack. For if a necessary event has been asserted to occur usually, clearly 
<A NAME="330"></A>the speaker has denied an attribute to be universal which is universal, 
<A NAME="331"></A>and so has made a mistake: and so he has if he has declared the usual attribute 
<A NAME="332"></A>to be necessary: for then he declares it to belong universally when it 
<A NAME="333"></A>does not so belong. Likewise also if he has declared the contrary of what 
<A NAME="334"></A>is usual to be necessary. For the contrary of a usual attribute is always 
<A NAME="335"></A>a comparatively rare attribute: e.g. if men are usually bad, they are comparatively 
<A NAME="336"></A>seldom good, so that his mistake is even worse if he has declared them 
<A NAME="337"></A>to be good of necessity. The same is true also if he has declared a mere 
<A NAME="338"></A>matter of chance to happen of necessity or usually; for a chance event 
<A NAME="339"></A>happens neither of necessity nor usually. If the thing happens usually, 
<A NAME="340"></A>then even supposing his statement does not distinguish whether he meant 
<A NAME="341"></A>that it happens usually or that it happens necessarily, it is open to you 
<A NAME="342"></A>to discuss it on the assumption that he meant that it happens necessarily: 
<A NAME="343"></A>e.g. if he has stated without any distinction that disinherited persons 
<A NAME="344"></A>are bad, you may assume in discussing it that he means that they are so 
<A NAME="345"></A>necessarily.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, look and see also if he has stated a thing to be an accident 
<A NAME="347"></A>of itself, taking it to be a different thing because it has a different 
<A NAME="348"></A>name, as Prodicus used to divide pleasures into joy and delight and good 
<A NAME="349"></A>cheer: for all these are names of the same thing, to wit, Pleasure. If 
<A NAME="350"></A>then any one says that joyfulness is an accidental attribute of cheerfulness, 
<A NAME="351"></A>he would be declaring it to be an accidental attribute of 
<A NAME="352"></A>itself.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="353"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>Inasmuch as contraries can be conjoined with each other in six 
<A NAME="355"></A>ways, and four of these conjunctions constitute a contrariety, we must 
<A NAME="356"></A>grasp the subject of contraries, in order that it may help us both in demolishing 
<A NAME="357"></A>and in establishing a view. Well then, that the modes of conjunction are 
<A NAME="358"></A>six is clear: for either (1) each of the contrary verbs will be conjoined 
<A NAME="359"></A>to each of the contrary objects; and this gives two modes: e.g. to do good 
<A NAME="360"></A>to friends and to do evil to enemies, or per contra to do evil to friends 
<A NAME="361"></A>and to do good to enemies. Or else (2) both verbs may be attached to one 
<A NAME="362"></A>object; and this too gives two modes, e.g. to do good to friends and to 
<A NAME="363"></A>do evil to friends, or to do good to enemies and to do evil to enemies. 
<A NAME="364"></A>Or (3) a single verb may be attached to both objects: and this also gives 
<A NAME="365"></A>two modes; e.g. to do good to friends and to do good to enemies, or to 
<A NAME="366"></A>do evil to friends and evil to enemies.
<A NAME="367"></A><BR><BR>The first two then of the aforesaid conjunctions do not constitute 
<A NAME="368"></A>any contrariety; for the doing of good to friends is not contrary to the 
<A NAME="369"></A>doing of evil to enemies: for both courses are desirable and belong to 
<A NAME="370"></A>the same disposition. Nor is the doing of evil to friends contrary to the 
<A NAME="371"></A>doing of good to enemies: for both of these are objectionable and belong 
<A NAME="372"></A>to the same disposition: and one objectionable thing is not generally thought 
<A NAME="373"></A>to be the contrary of another, unless the one be an expression denoting 
<A NAME="374"></A>an excess, and the other an expression denoting a defect: for an excess 
<A NAME="375"></A>is generally thought to belong to the class of objectionable things, and 
<A NAME="376"></A>likewise also a defect. But the other four all constitute a contrariety. 
<A NAME="377"></A>For to do good to friends is contrary to the doing of evil to friends: 
<A NAME="378"></A>for it proceeds from the contrary disposition, and the one is desirable, 
<A NAME="379"></A>and the other objectionable. The case is the same also in regard to the 
<A NAME="380"></A>other conjunctions: for in each combination the one course is desirable, 
<A NAME="381"></A>and the other objectionable, and the one belongs to a reasonable disposition 
<A NAME="382"></A>and the other to a bad. Clearly, then, from what has been said, the same 
<A NAME="383"></A>course has more than one contrary. For the doing of good to friends has 
<A NAME="384"></A>as its contrary both the doing of good to enemies and the doing of evil 
<A NAME="385"></A>to friends. Likewise, if we examine them in the same way, we shall find 
<A NAME="386"></A>that the contraries of each of the others also are two in number. Select 
<A NAME="387"></A>therefore whichever of the two contraries is useful in attacking the 
<A NAME="388"></A>thesis.
<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, if the accident of a thing have a contrary, see whether 
<A NAME="390"></A>it belongs to the subject to which the accident in question has been declared 
<A NAME="391"></A>to belong: for if the latter belongs the former could not belong; for it 
<A NAME="392"></A>is impossible that contrary predicates should belong at the same time to 
<A NAME="393"></A>the same thing.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>Or again, look and see if anything has been said about something, 
<A NAME="395"></A>of such a kind that if it be true, contrary predicates must necessarily 
<A NAME="396"></A>belong to the thing: e.g. if he has said that the 'Ideas' exist in us. 
<A NAME="397"></A>For then the result will be that they are both in motion and at rest, and 
<A NAME="398"></A>moreover that they are objects both of sensation and of thought. For according 
<A NAME="399"></A>to the views of those who posit the existence of Ideas, those Ideas are 
<A NAME="400"></A>at rest and are objects of thought; while if they exist in us, it is impossible 
<A NAME="401"></A>that they should be unmoved: for when we move, it follows necessarily that 
<A NAME="402"></A>all that is in us moves with us as well. Clearly also they are objects 
<A NAME="403"></A>of sensation, if they exist in us: for it is through the sensation of sight 
<A NAME="404"></A>that we recognize the Form present in each individual.
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>Again, if there be posited an accident which has a contrary, look 
<A NAME="406"></A>and see if that which admits of the accident will admit of its contrary 
<A NAME="407"></A>as well: for the same thing admits of contraries. Thus (e.g.) if he has 
<A NAME="408"></A>asserted that hatred follows anger, hatred would in that case be in the 
<A NAME="409"></A>'spirited faculty': for that is where anger is. You should therefore look 
<A NAME="410"></A>and see if its contrary, to wit, friendship, be also in the 'spirited faculty': 
<A NAME="411"></A>for if not-if friendship is in the faculty of desire-then hatred could 
<A NAME="412"></A>not follow anger. Likewise also if he has asserted that the faculty of 
<A NAME="413"></A>desire is ignorant. For if it were capable of ignorance, it would be capable 
<A NAME="414"></A>of knowledge as well: and this is not generally held-I mean that the faculty 
<A NAME="415"></A>of desire is capable of knowledge. For purposes, then, of overthrowing 
<A NAME="416"></A>a view, as has been said, this rule should be observed: but for purposes 
<A NAME="417"></A>of establishing one, though the rule will not help you to assert that the 
<A NAME="418"></A>accident actually belongs, it will help you to assert that it may possibly 
<A NAME="419"></A>belong. For having shown that the thing in question will not admit of the 
<A NAME="420"></A>contrary of the accident asserted, we shall have shown that the accident 
<A NAME="421"></A>neither belongs nor can possibly belong; while on the other hand, if we 
<A NAME="422"></A>show that the contrary belongs, or that the thing is capable of the contrary, 
<A NAME="423"></A>we shall not indeed as yet have shown that the accident asserted does belong 
<A NAME="424"></A>as well; our proof will merely have gone to this point, that it is possible 
<A NAME="425"></A>for it to belong.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="426"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="427"></A><BR><BR>Seeing that the modes of opposition are four in number, you should 
<A NAME="428"></A>look for arguments among the contradictories of your terms, converting 
<A NAME="429"></A>the order of their sequence, both when demolishing and when establishing 
<A NAME="430"></A>a view, and you should secure them by means of induction-such arguments 
<A NAME="431"></A>(e.g.) as that man be an animal, what is not an animal is not a man': and 
<A NAME="432"></A>likewise also in other instances of contradictories. For in those cases 
<A NAME="433"></A>the sequence is converse: for 'animal' follows upon 'man but 'not-animal' 
<A NAME="434"></A>does not follow upon 'not-man', but conversely 'not-man' upon 'not-animal'. 
<A NAME="435"></A>In all cases, therefore, a postulate of this sort should be made, (e.g.) 
<A NAME="436"></A>that 'If the honourable is pleasant, what is not pleasant is not honourable, 
<A NAME="437"></A>while if the latter be untrue, so is the former'. Likewise, also, 'If what 
<A NAME="438"></A>is not pleasant be not honourable, then what is honourable is pleasant'. 
<A NAME="439"></A>Clearly, then, the conversion of the sequence formed by contradiction of 
<A NAME="440"></A>the terms of the thesis is a method convertible for both 
<A NAME="441"></A>purposes.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>Then look also at the case of the contraries of S and P in the 
<A NAME="443"></A>thesis, and see if the contrary of the one follows upon the contrary of 
<A NAME="444"></A>the other, either directly or conversely, both when you are demolishing 
<A NAME="445"></A>and when you are establishing a view: secure arguments of this kind as 
<A NAME="446"></A>well by means of induction, so far as may be required. Now the sequence 
<A NAME="447"></A>is direct in a case such as that of courage and cowardice: for upon the 
<A NAME="448"></A>one of them virtue follows, and vice upon the other; and upon the one it 
<A NAME="449"></A>follows that it is desirable, while upon the other it follows that it is 
<A NAME="450"></A>objectionable. The sequence, therefore, in the latter case also is direct; 
<A NAME="451"></A>for the desirable is the contrary of the objectionable. Likewise also in 
<A NAME="452"></A>other cases. The sequence is, on the other hand, converse in such a case 
<A NAME="453"></A>as this: Health follows upon vigour, but disease does not follow upon debility; 
<A NAME="454"></A>rather debility follows upon disease. In this case, then, clearly the sequence 
<A NAME="455"></A>is converse. Converse sequence is, however, rare in the case of contraries; 
<A NAME="456"></A>usually the sequence is direct. If, therefore, the contrary of the one 
<A NAME="457"></A>term does not follow upon the contrary of the other either directly or 
<A NAME="458"></A>conversely, clearly neither does the one term follow upon the other in 
<A NAME="459"></A>the statement made: whereas if the one followed the other in the case of 
<A NAME="460"></A>the contraries, it must of necessity do so as well in the original 
<A NAME="461"></A>statement.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR>You should look also into cases of the privation or presence of 
<A NAME="463"></A>a state in like manner to the case of contraries. Only, in the case of 
<A NAME="464"></A>such privations the converse sequence does not occur: the sequence is always 
<A NAME="465"></A>bound to be direct: e.g. as sensation follows sight, while absence of sensation 
<A NAME="466"></A>follows blindness. For the opposition of sensation to absence of sensation 
<A NAME="467"></A>is an opposition of the presence to the privation of a state: for the one 
<A NAME="468"></A>of them is a state, and the other the privation of it.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>The case of relative terms should also be studied in like manner 
<A NAME="470"></A>to that of a state and its privation: for the sequence of these as well 
<A NAME="471"></A>is direct; e.g. if 3/1 is a multiple, then 1/3 is a fraction: for 3/1 is 
<A NAME="472"></A>relative to 1/3, and so is a multiple to a fraction. Again, if knowledge 
<A NAME="473"></A>be a conceiving, then also the object of knowledge is an object of conception; 
<A NAME="474"></A>and if sight be a sensation, then also the object of sight is an object 
<A NAME="475"></A>of sensation. An objection may be made that there is no necessity for the 
<A NAME="476"></A>sequence to take place, in the case of relative terms, in the way described: 
<A NAME="477"></A>for the object of sensation is an object of knowledge, whereas sensation 
<A NAME="478"></A>is not knowledge. The objection is, however, not generally received as 
<A NAME="479"></A>really true; for many people deny that there is knowledge of objects of 
<A NAME="480"></A>sensation. Moreover, the principle stated is just as useful for the contrary 
<A NAME="481"></A>purpose, e.g. to show that the object of sensation is not an object of 
<A NAME="482"></A>knowledge, on the ground that neither is sensation knowledge.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="483"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="484"></A><BR><BR>Again look at the case of the co-ordinates and inflected forms 
<A NAME="485"></A>of the terms in the thesis, both in demolishing and in establishing it. 
<A NAME="486"></A>By co-ordinates' are meant terms such as the following: 'Just deeds' and 
<A NAME="487"></A>the 'just man' are coordinates of 'justice', and 'courageous deeds' and 
<A NAME="488"></A>the 'courageous man' are co-ordinates of courage. Likewise also things 
<A NAME="489"></A>that tend to produce and to preserve anything are called co-ordinates of 
<A NAME="490"></A>that which they tend to produce and to preserve, as e.g. 'healthy habits' 
<A NAME="491"></A>are co-ordinates of 'health' and a 'vigorous constitutional' of a 'vigorous 
<A NAME="492"></A>constitution' and so forth also in other cases. 'Co-ordinate', then, usually 
<A NAME="493"></A>describes cases such as these, whereas 'inflected forms' are such as the 
<A NAME="494"></A>following: 'justly', 'courageously', 'healthily', and such as are formed 
<A NAME="495"></A>in this way. It is usually held that words when used in their inflected 
<A NAME="496"></A>forms as well are co-ordinates, as (e.g.) 'justly' in relation to justice, 
<A NAME="497"></A>and 'courageously' to courage; and then 'co-ordinate' describes all the 
<A NAME="498"></A>members of the same kindred series, e.g. 'justice', 'just', of a man or 
<A NAME="499"></A>an act, 'justly'. Clearly, then, when any one member, whatever its kind, 
<A NAME="500"></A>of the same kindred series is shown to be good or praiseworthy, then all 
<A NAME="501"></A>the rest as well come to be shown to be so: e.g. if 'justice' be something 
<A NAME="502"></A>praiseworthy, then so will 'just', of a man or thing, and 'justly' connote 
<A NAME="503"></A>something praiseworthy. Then 'justly' will be rendered also 'praiseworthily', 
<A NAME="504"></A>derived will by the same inflexion from 'the praiseworthy' whereby 'justly' 
<A NAME="505"></A>is derived from 'justice'.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>Look not only in the case of the subject mentioned, but also in 
<A NAME="507"></A>the case of its contrary, for the contrary predicate: e.g. argue that good 
<A NAME="508"></A>is not necessarily pleasant; for neither is evil painful: or that, if the 
<A NAME="509"></A>latter be the case, so is the former. Also, if justice be knowledge, then 
<A NAME="510"></A>injustice is ignorance: and if 'justly' means 'knowingly' and 'skilfully', 
<A NAME="511"></A>then 'unjustly' means 'ignorantly' and 'unskilfully': whereas if the latter 
<A NAME="512"></A>be not true, neither is the former, as in the instance given just now: 
<A NAME="513"></A>for 'unjustly' is more likely to seem equivalent to 'skilfully' than to 
<A NAME="514"></A>'unskilfully'. This commonplace rule has been stated before in dealing 
<A NAME="515"></A>with the sequence of contraries; for all we are claiming now is that the 
<A NAME="516"></A>contrary of P shall follow the contrary of S.
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, look at the modes of generation and destruction of a 
<A NAME="518"></A>thing, and at the things which tend to produce or to destroy it, both in 
<A NAME="519"></A>demolishing and in establishing a view. For those things whose modes of 
<A NAME="520"></A>generation rank among good things, are themselves also good; and if they 
<A NAME="521"></A>themselves be good, so also are their modes of generation. If, on the other 
<A NAME="522"></A>hand, their modes of generation be evil, then they themselves also are 
<A NAME="523"></A>evil. In regard to modes of destruction the converse is true: for if the 
<A NAME="524"></A>modes of destruction rank as good things, then they themselves rank as 
<A NAME="525"></A>evil things; whereas if the modes of destruction count as evil, they themselves 
<A NAME="526"></A>count as good. The same argument applies also to things tending to produce 
<A NAME="527"></A>and destroy: for things whose productive causes are good, themselves also 
<A NAME="528"></A>rank as good; whereas if causes destructive of them are good, they themselves 
<A NAME="529"></A>rank as evil.

<A NAME="530"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>Again, look at things which are like the subject in question, and 
<A NAME="532"></A>see if they are in like case; e.g. if one branch of knowledge has more 
<A NAME="533"></A>than one object, so also will one opinion; and if to possess sight be to 
<A NAME="534"></A>see, then also to possess hearing will be to hear. Likewise also in the 
<A NAME="535"></A>case of other things, both those which are and those which are generally 
<A NAME="536"></A>held to be like. The rule in question is useful for both purposes; for 
<A NAME="537"></A>if it be as stated in the case of some one like thing, it is so with the 
<A NAME="538"></A>other like things as well, whereas if it be not so in the case of some 
<A NAME="539"></A>one of them, neither is it so in the case of the others. Look and see also 
<A NAME="540"></A>whether the cases are alike as regards a single thing and a number of things: 
<A NAME="541"></A>for sometimes there is a discrepancy. Thus, if to 'know' a thing be to 
<A NAME="542"></A>'think of' it, then also to 'know many things' is to 'be thinking of many 
<A NAME="543"></A>things'; whereas this is not true; for it is possible to know many things 
<A NAME="544"></A>but not to be thinking of them. If, then, the latter proposition be not 
<A NAME="545"></A>true, neither was the former that dealt with a single thing, viz. that 
<A NAME="546"></A>to 'know' a thing is to 'think of' it.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, argue from greater and less degrees. In regard to greater 
<A NAME="548"></A>degrees there are four commonplace rules. One is: See whether a greater 
<A NAME="549"></A>degree of the predicate follows a greater degree of the subject: e.g. if 
<A NAME="550"></A>pleasure be good, see whether also a greater pleasure be a greater good: 
<A NAME="551"></A>and if to do a wrong be evil, see whether also to do a greater wrong is 
<A NAME="552"></A>a greater evil. Now this rule is of use for both purposes: for if an increase 
<A NAME="553"></A>of the accident follows an increase of the subject, as we have said, clearly 
<A NAME="554"></A>the accident belongs; while if it does not follow, the accident does not 
<A NAME="555"></A>belong. You should establish this by induction. Another rule is: If one 
<A NAME="556"></A>predicate be attributed to two subjects; then supposing it does not belong 
<A NAME="557"></A>to the subject to which it is the more likely to belong, neither does it 
<A NAME="558"></A>belong where it is less likely to belong; while if it does belong where 
<A NAME="559"></A>it is less likely to belong, then it belongs as well where it is more likely. 
<A NAME="560"></A>Again: If two predicates be attributed to one subject, then if the one 
<A NAME="561"></A>which is more generally thought to belong does not belong, neither does 
<A NAME="562"></A>the one that is less generally thought to belong; or, if the one that is 
<A NAME="563"></A>less generally thought to belong does belong, so also does the other. Moreover: 
<A NAME="564"></A>If two predicates be attributed to two subjects, then if the one which 
<A NAME="565"></A>is more usually thought to belong to the one subject does not belong, neither 
<A NAME="566"></A>does the remaining predicate belong to the remaining subject; or, if the 
<A NAME="567"></A>one which is less usually thought to belong to the one subject does belong, 
<A NAME="568"></A>so too does the remaining predicate to the remaining 
<A NAME="569"></A>subject.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, you can argue from the fact that an attribute belongs, 
<A NAME="571"></A>or is generally supposed to belong, in a like degree, in three ways, viz. 
<A NAME="572"></A>those described in the last three rules given in regard to a greater degree.' 
<A NAME="573"></A>For supposing that one predicate belongs, or is supposed to belong, to 
<A NAME="574"></A>two subjects in a like degree, then if it does not belong to the one, neither 
<A NAME="575"></A>does it belong to the other; while if it belongs to the one, it belongs 
<A NAME="576"></A>to the remaining one as well. Or, supposing two predicates to belong in 
<A NAME="577"></A>a like degree to the same subject, then, if the one does not belong, neither 
<A NAME="578"></A>does the remaining one; while if the one does belong, the remaining one 
<A NAME="579"></A>belongs as well. The case is the same also if two predicates belong in 
<A NAME="580"></A>a like degree to two subjects; for if the one predicate does not belong 
<A NAME="581"></A>to the one subject, neither does the remaining predicate belong to the 
<A NAME="582"></A>remaining subject, while if the one predicate does belong to the one subject, 
<A NAME="583"></A>the remaining predicate belongs to the remaining subject as 
<A NAME="584"></A>well.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="585"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR>You can argue, then, from greater or less or like degrees of truth 
<A NAME="587"></A>in the aforesaid number of ways. Moreover, you should argue from the addition 
<A NAME="588"></A>of one thing to another. If the addition of one thing to another makes 
<A NAME="589"></A>that other good or white, whereas formerly it was not white or good, then 
<A NAME="590"></A>the thing added will be white or good-it will possess the character it 
<A NAME="591"></A>imparts to the whole as well. Moreover, if an addition of something to 
<A NAME="592"></A>a given object intensifies the character which it had as given, then the 
<A NAME="593"></A>thing added will itself as well be of that character. Likewise, also, in 
<A NAME="594"></A>the case of other attributes. The rule is not applicable in all cases, 
<A NAME="595"></A>but only in those in which the excess described as an 'increased intensity' 
<A NAME="596"></A>is found to take place. The above rule is, however, not convertible for 
<A NAME="597"></A>overthrowing a view. For if the thing added does not make the other good, 
<A NAME="598"></A>it is not thereby made clear whether in itself it may not be good: for 
<A NAME="599"></A>the addition of good to evil does not necessarily make the whole good, 
<A NAME="600"></A>any more than the addition of white to black makes the whole 
<A NAME="601"></A>white.
<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR>Again, any predicate of which we can speak of greater or less degrees 
<A NAME="603"></A>belongs also absolutely: for greater or less degrees of good or of white 
<A NAME="604"></A>will not be attributed to what is not good or white: for a bad thing will 
<A NAME="605"></A>never be said to have a greater or less degree of goodness than another, 
<A NAME="606"></A>but always of badness. This rule is not convertible, either, for the purpose 
<A NAME="607"></A>of overthrowing a predication: for several predicates of which we cannot 
<A NAME="608"></A>speak of a greater degree belong absolutely: for the term 'man' is not 
<A NAME="609"></A>attributed in greater and less degrees, but a man is a man for all 
<A NAME="610"></A>that.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR>You should examine in the same way predicates attributed in a given 
<A NAME="612"></A>respect, and at a given time and place: for if the predicate be possible 
<A NAME="613"></A>in some respect, it is possible also absolutely. Likewise, also, is what 
<A NAME="614"></A>is predicated at a given time or place: for what is absolutely impossible 
<A NAME="615"></A>is not possible either in any respect or at any place or time. An objection 
<A NAME="616"></A>may be raised that in a given respect people may be good by nature, e.g. 
<A NAME="617"></A>they may be generous or temperately inclined, while absolutely they are 
<A NAME="618"></A>not good by nature, because no one is prudent by nature. Likewise, also, 
<A NAME="619"></A>it is possible for a destructible thing to escape destruction at a given 
<A NAME="620"></A>time, whereas it is not possible for it to escape absolutely. In the same 
<A NAME="621"></A>way also it is a good thing at certain places to follow see and such a 
<A NAME="622"></A>diet, e.g. in infected areas, though it is not a good thing absolutely. 
<A NAME="623"></A>Moreover, in certain places it is possible to live singly and alone, but 
<A NAME="624"></A>absolutely it is not possible to exist singly and alone. In the same way 
<A NAME="625"></A>also it is in certain places honourable to sacrifice one's father, e.g. 
<A NAME="626"></A>among the Triballi, whereas, absolutely, it is not honourable. Or possibly 
<A NAME="627"></A>this may indicate a relativity not to places but to persons: for it is 
<A NAME="628"></A>all the same wherever they may be: for everywhere it will be held honourable 
<A NAME="629"></A>among the Triballi themselves, just because they are Triballi. Again, at 
<A NAME="630"></A>certain times it is a good thing to take medicines, e.g. when one is ill, 
<A NAME="631"></A>but it is not so absolutely. Or possibly this again may indicate a relativity 
<A NAME="632"></A>not to a certain time, but to a certain state of health: for it is all 
<A NAME="633"></A>the same whenever it occurs, if only one be in that state. A thing is 'absolutely' 
<A NAME="634"></A>so which without any addition you are prepared to say is honourable or 
<A NAME="635"></A>the contrary. Thus (e.g.) you will deny that to sacrifice one's father 
<A NAME="636"></A>is honourable: it is honourable only to certain persons: it is not therefore 
<A NAME="637"></A>honourable absolutely. On the other hand, to honour the gods you will declare 
<A NAME="638"></A>to be honourable without adding anything, because that is honourable absolutely. 
<A NAME="639"></A>So that whatever without any addition is generally accounted to be honourable 
<A NAME="640"></A>or dishonourable or anything else of that kind, will be said to be so 
<A NAME="641"></A>'absolutely'.
