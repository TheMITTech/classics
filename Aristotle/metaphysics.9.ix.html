<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>"WE have treated of that which is primarily and to which all the 
<A NAME="13"></A>other categories of being are referred-i.e. of substance. For it is in 
<A NAME="14"></A>virtue of the concept of substance that the others also are said to be-quantity 
<A NAME="15"></A>and quality and the like; for all will be found to involve the concept 
<A NAME="16"></A>of substance, as we said in the first part of our work. And since 'being' 
<A NAME="17"></A>is in one way divided into individual thing, quality, and quantity, and 
<A NAME="18"></A>is in another way distinguished in respect of potency and complete reality, 
<A NAME="19"></A>and of function, let us now add a discussion of potency and complete reality. 
<A NAME="20"></A>And first let us explain potency in the strictest sense, which is, however, 
<A NAME="21"></A>not the most useful for our present purpose. For potency and actuality 
<A NAME="22"></A>extend beyond the cases that involve a reference to motion. But when we 
<A NAME="23"></A>have spoken of this first kind, we shall in our discussions of actuality' 
<A NAME="24"></A>explain the other kinds of potency as well. <BR><BR>"We have pointed out 
<A NAME="25"></A>elsewhere that 'potency' and the word 'can' have several senses. Of these 
<A NAME="26"></A>we may neglect all the potencies that are so called by an equivocation. 
<A NAME="27"></A>For some are called so by analogy, as in geometry we say one thing is or 
<A NAME="28"></A>is not a 'power' of another by virtue of the presence or absence of some 
<A NAME="29"></A>relation between them. But all potencies that conform to the same type 
<A NAME="30"></A>are originative sources of some kind, and are called potencies in reference 
<A NAME="31"></A>to one primary kind of potency, which is an originative source of change 
<A NAME="32"></A>in another thing or in the thing itself qua other. For one kind is a potency 
<A NAME="33"></A>of being acted on, i.e. the originative source, in the very thing acted 
<A NAME="34"></A>on, of its being passively changed by another thing or by itself qua other; 
<A NAME="35"></A>and another kind is a state of insusceptibility to change for the worse 
<A NAME="36"></A>and to destruction by another thing or by the thing itself qua other by 
<A NAME="37"></A>virtue of an originative source of change. In all these definitions is 
<A NAME="38"></A>implied the formula if potency in the primary sense.-And again these so-called 
<A NAME="39"></A>potencies are potencies either of merely acting or being acted on, or of 
<A NAME="40"></A>acting or being acted on well, so that even in the formulae of the latter 
<A NAME="41"></A>the formulae of the prior kinds of potency are somehow implied. <BR><BR>"Obviously, 
<A NAME="42"></A>then, in a sense the potency of acting and of being acted on is one (for 
<A NAME="43"></A>a thing may be 'capable' either because it can itself be acted on or because 
<A NAME="44"></A>something else can be acted on by it), but in a sense the potencies are 
<A NAME="45"></A>different. For the one is in the thing acted on; it is because it contains 
<A NAME="46"></A>a certain originative source, and because even the matter is an originative 
<A NAME="47"></A>source, that the thing acted on is acted on, and one thing by one, another 
<A NAME="48"></A>by another; for that which is oily can be burnt, and that which yields 
<A NAME="49"></A>in a particular way can be crushed; and similarly in all other cases. But 
<A NAME="50"></A>the other potency is in the agent, e.g. heat and the art of building are 
<A NAME="51"></A>present, one in that which can produce heat and the other in the man who 
<A NAME="52"></A>can build. And so, in so far as a thing is an organic unity, it cannot 
<A NAME="53"></A>be acted on by itself; for it is one and not two different things. And 
<A NAME="54"></A>'impotence'and 'impotent' stand for the privation which is contrary to 
<A NAME="55"></A>potency of this sort, so that every potency belongs to the same subject 
<A NAME="56"></A>and refers to the same process as a corresponding impotence. Privation 
<A NAME="57"></A>has several senses; for it means (1) that which has not a certain quality 
<A NAME="58"></A>and (2) that which might naturally have it but has not it, either (a) in 
<A NAME="59"></A>general or (b) when it might naturally have it, and either (a) in some 
<A NAME="60"></A>particular way, e.g. when it has not it completely, or (b) when it has 
<A NAME="61"></A>not it at all. And in certain cases if things which naturally have a quality 
<A NAME="62"></A>lose it by violence, we say they have suffered privation.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="63"></A><B>Part 2</B>
<A NAME="64"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>"Since some such originative sources are present in soulless things, 
<A NAME="66"></A>and others in things possessed of soul, and in soul, and in the rational 
<A NAME="67"></A>part of the soul, clearly some potencies will, be non-rational and some 
<A NAME="68"></A>will be non-rational and some will be accompanied by a rational formula. 
<A NAME="69"></A>This is why all arts, i.e. all productive forms of knowledge, are potencies; 
<A NAME="70"></A>they are originative sources of change in another thing or in the artist 
<A NAME="71"></A>himself considered as other. <BR><BR>"And each of those which are accompanied 
<A NAME="72"></A>by a rational formula is alike capable of contrary effects, but one non-rational 
<A NAME="73"></A>power produces one effect; e.g. the hot is capable only of heating, but 
<A NAME="74"></A>the medical art can produce both disease and health. The reason is that 
<A NAME="75"></A>science is a rational formula, and the same rational formula explains a 
<A NAME="76"></A>thing and its privation, only not in the same way; and in a sense it applies 
<A NAME="77"></A>to both, but in a sense it applies rather to the positive fact. Therefore 
<A NAME="78"></A>such sciences must deal with contraries, but with one in virtue of their 
<A NAME="79"></A>own nature and with the other not in virtue of their nature; for the rational 
<A NAME="80"></A>formula applies to one object in virtue of that object's nature, and to 
<A NAME="81"></A>the other, in a sense, accidentally. For it is by denial and removal that 
<A NAME="82"></A>it exhibits the contrary; for the contrary is the primary privation, and 
<A NAME="83"></A>this is the removal of the positive term. Now since contraries do not occur 
<A NAME="84"></A>in the same thing, but science is a potency which depends on the possession 
<A NAME="85"></A>of a rational formula, and the soul possesses an originative source of 
<A NAME="86"></A>movement; therefore, while the wholesome produces only health and the calorific 
<A NAME="87"></A>only heat and the frigorific only cold, the scientific man produces both 
<A NAME="88"></A>the contrary effects. For the rational formula is one which applies to 
<A NAME="89"></A>both, though not in the same way, and it is in a soul which possesses an 
<A NAME="90"></A>originative source of movement; so that the soul will start both processes 
<A NAME="91"></A>from the same originative source, having linked them up with the same thing. 
<A NAME="92"></A>And so the things whose potency is according to a rational formula act 
<A NAME="93"></A>contrariwise to the things whose potency is non-rational; for the products 
<A NAME="94"></A>of the former are included under one originative source, the rational formula. 
<A NAME="95"></A><BR><BR>"It is obvious also that the potency of merely doing a thing or 
<A NAME="96"></A>having it done to one is implied in that of doing it or having it done 
<A NAME="97"></A>well, but the latter is not always implied in the former: for he who does 
<A NAME="98"></A>a thing well must also do it, but he who does it merely need not also do 
<A NAME="99"></A>it well.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="100"></A><B>Part 3</B>
<A NAME="101"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>"There are some who say, as the Megaric school does, that a thing 
<A NAME="103"></A>'can' act only when it is acting, and when it is not acting it 'cannot' 
<A NAME="104"></A>act, e.g. that he who is not building cannot build, but only he who is 
<A NAME="105"></A>building, when he is building; and so in all other cases. It is not hard 
<A NAME="106"></A>to see the absurdities that attend this view. <BR><BR>"For it is clear 
<A NAME="107"></A>that on this view a man will not be a builder unless he is building (for 
<A NAME="108"></A>to be a builder is to be able to build), and so with the other arts. If, 
<A NAME="109"></A>then, it is impossible to have such arts if one has not at some time learnt 
<A NAME="110"></A>and acquired them, and it is then impossible not to have them if one has 
<A NAME="111"></A>not sometime lost them (either by forgetfulness or by some accident or 
<A NAME="112"></A>by time; for it cannot be by the destruction of the object, for that lasts 
<A NAME="113"></A>for ever), a man will not have the art when he has ceased to use it, and 
<A NAME="114"></A>yet he may immediately build again; how then will he have got the art? 
<A NAME="115"></A>And similarly with regard to lifeless things; nothing will be either cold 
<A NAME="116"></A>or hot or sweet or perceptible at all if people are not perceiving it; 
<A NAME="117"></A>so that the upholders of this view will have to maintain the doctrine of 
<A NAME="118"></A>Protagoras. But, indeed, nothing will even have perception if it is not 
<A NAME="119"></A>perceiving, i.e. exercising its perception. If, then, that is blind which 
<A NAME="120"></A>has not sight though it would naturally have it, when it would naturally 
<A NAME="121"></A>have it and when it still exists, the same people will be blind many times 
<A NAME="122"></A>in the day-and deaf too. <BR><BR>"Again, if that which is deprived of potency 
<A NAME="123"></A>is incapable, that which is not happening will be incapable of happening; 
<A NAME="124"></A>but he who says of that which is incapable of happening either that it 
<A NAME="125"></A>is or that it will be will say what is untrue; for this is what incapacity 
<A NAME="126"></A>meant. Therefore these views do away with both movement and becoming. For 
<A NAME="127"></A>that which stands will always stand, and that which sits will always sit, 
<A NAME="128"></A>since if it is sitting it will not get up; for that which, as we are told, 
<A NAME="129"></A>cannot get up will be incapable of getting up. But we cannot say this, 
<A NAME="130"></A>so that evidently potency and actuality are different (but these views 
<A NAME="131"></A>make potency and actuality the same, and so it is no small thing they are 
<A NAME="132"></A>seeking to annihilate), so that it is possible that a thing may be capable 
<A NAME="133"></A>of being and not he, and capable of not being and yet he, and similarly 
<A NAME="134"></A>with the other kinds of predicate; it may be capable of walking and yet 
<A NAME="135"></A>not walk, or capable of not walking and yet walk. And a thing is capable 
<A NAME="136"></A>of doing something if there will be nothing impossible in its having the 
<A NAME="137"></A>actuality of that of which it is said to have the capacity. I mean, for 
<A NAME="138"></A>instance, if a thing is capable of sitting and it is open to it to sit, 
<A NAME="139"></A>there will be nothing impossible in its actually sitting; and similarly 
<A NAME="140"></A>if it is capable of being moved or moving, or of standing or making to 
<A NAME="141"></A>stand, or of being or coming to be, or of not being or not coming to be. 
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>"The word 'actuality', which we connect with 'complete reality', 
<A NAME="143"></A>has, in the main, been extended from movements to other things; for actuality 
<A NAME="144"></A>in the strict sense is thought to be identical with movement. And so people 
<A NAME="145"></A>do not assign movement to non-existent things, though they do assign some 
<A NAME="146"></A>other predicates. E.g. they say that non-existent things are objects of 
<A NAME="147"></A>thought and desire, but not that they are moved; and this because, while 
<A NAME="148"></A>ex hypothesi they do not actually exist, they would have to exist actually 
<A NAME="149"></A>if they were moved. For of non-existent things some exist potentially; 
<A NAME="150"></A>but they do not exist, because they do not exist in complete 
<A NAME="151"></A>reality.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="152"></A><B>Part 4</B>
<A NAME="153"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>"If what we have described is identical with the capable or convertible 
<A NAME="155"></A>with it, evidently it cannot be true to say 'this is capable of being but 
<A NAME="156"></A>will not be', which would imply that the things incapable of being would 
<A NAME="157"></A>on this showing vanish. Suppose, for instance, that a man-one who did not 
<A NAME="158"></A>take account of that which is incapable of being-were to say that the diagonal 
<A NAME="159"></A>of the square is capable of being measured but will not be measured, because 
<A NAME="160"></A>a thing may well be capable of being or coming to be, and yet not be or 
<A NAME="161"></A>be about to be. But from the premisses this necessarily follows, that if 
<A NAME="162"></A>we actually supposed that which is not, but is capable of being, to be 
<A NAME="163"></A>or to have come to be, there will be nothing impossible in this; but the 
<A NAME="164"></A>result will be impossible, for the measuring of the diagonal is impossible. 
<A NAME="165"></A>For the false and the impossible are not the same; that you are standing 
<A NAME="166"></A>now is false, but that you should be standing is not impossible. <BR><BR>"At 
<A NAME="167"></A>the same time it is clear that if, when A is real, B must be real, then, 
<A NAME="168"></A>when A is possible, B also must be possible. For if B need not be possible, 
<A NAME="169"></A>there is nothing to prevent its not being possible. Now let A be supposed 
<A NAME="170"></A>possible. Then, when A was possible, we agreed that nothing impossible 
<A NAME="171"></A>followed if A were supposed to be real; and then B must of course be real. 
<A NAME="172"></A>But we supposed B to be impossible. Let it be impossible then. If, then, 
<A NAME="173"></A>B is impossible, A also must be so. But the first was supposed impossible; 
<A NAME="174"></A>therefore the second also is impossible. If, then, A is possible, B also 
<A NAME="175"></A>will be possible, if they were so related that if A,is real, B must be 
<A NAME="176"></A>real. If, then, A and B being thus related, B is not possible on this condition, 
<A NAME="177"></A>and B will not be related as was supposed. And if when A is possible, B 
<A NAME="178"></A>must be possible, then if A is real, B also must be real. For to say that 
<A NAME="179"></A>B must be possible, if A is possible, means this, that if A is real both 
<A NAME="180"></A>at the time when and in the way in which it was supposed capable of being 
<A NAME="181"></A>real, B also must then and in that way be real.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="182"></A><B>Part 5</B>
<A NAME="183"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>"As all potencies are either innate, like the senses, or come by 
<A NAME="185"></A>practice, like the power of playing the flute, or by learning, like artistic 
<A NAME="186"></A>power, those which come by practice or by rational formula we must acquire 
<A NAME="187"></A>by previous exercise but this is not necessary with those which are not 
<A NAME="188"></A>of this nature and which imply passivity. <BR><BR>"Since that which is 
<A NAME="189"></A>'capable' is capable of something and at some time in some way (with all 
<A NAME="190"></A>the other qualifications which must be present in the definition), and 
<A NAME="191"></A>since some things can produce change according to a rational formula and 
<A NAME="192"></A>their potencies involve such a formula, while other things are nonrational 
<A NAME="193"></A>and their potencies are non-rational, and the former potencies must be 
<A NAME="194"></A>in a living thing, while the latter can be both in the living and in the 
<A NAME="195"></A>lifeless; as regards potencies of the latter kind, when the agent and the 
<A NAME="196"></A>patient meet in the way appropriate to the potency in question, the one 
<A NAME="197"></A>must act and the other be acted on, but with the former kind of potency 
<A NAME="198"></A>this is not necessary. For the nonrational potencies are all productive 
<A NAME="199"></A>of one effect each, but the rational produce contrary effects, so that 
<A NAME="200"></A>if they produced their effects necessarily they would produce contrary 
<A NAME="201"></A>effects at the same time; but this is impossible. There must, then, be 
<A NAME="202"></A>something else that decides; I mean by this, desire or will. For whichever 
<A NAME="203"></A>of two things the animal desires decisively, it will do, when it is present, 
<A NAME="204"></A>and meets the passive object, in the way appropriate to the potency in 
<A NAME="205"></A>question. Therefore everything which has a rational potency, when it desires 
<A NAME="206"></A>that for which it has a potency and in the circumstances in which it has 
<A NAME="207"></A>the potency, must do this. And it has the potency in question when the 
<A NAME="208"></A>passive object is present and is in a certain state; if not it will not 
<A NAME="209"></A>be able to act. (To add the qualification 'if nothing external prevents 
<A NAME="210"></A>it' is not further necessary; for it has the potency on the terms on which 
<A NAME="211"></A>this is a potency of acting, and it is this not in all circumstances but 
<A NAME="212"></A>on certain conditions, among which will be the exclusion of external hindrances; 
<A NAME="213"></A>for these are barred by some of the positive qualifications.) And so even 
<A NAME="214"></A>if one has a rational wish, or an appetite, to do two things or contrary 
<A NAME="215"></A>things at the same time, one will not do them; for it is not on these terms 
<A NAME="216"></A>that one has the potency for them, nor is it a potency of doing both at 
<A NAME="217"></A>the same time, since one will do the things which it is a potency of doing, 
<A NAME="218"></A>on the terms on which one has the potency.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="219"></A><B>Part 6</B>
<A NAME="220"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>"Since we have treated of the kind of potency which is related 
<A NAME="222"></A>to movement, let us discuss actuality-what, and what kind of thing, actuality 
<A NAME="223"></A>is. For in the course of our analysis it will also become clear, with regard 
<A NAME="224"></A>to the potential, that we not only ascribe potency to that whose nature 
<A NAME="225"></A>it is to move something else, or to be moved by something else, either 
<A NAME="226"></A>without qualification or in some particular way, but also use the word 
<A NAME="227"></A>in another sense, which is the reason of the inquiry in the course of which 
<A NAME="228"></A>we have discussed these previous senses also. Actuality, then, is the existence 
<A NAME="229"></A>of a thing not in the way which we express by 'potentially'; we say that 
<A NAME="230"></A>potentially, for instance, a statue of Hermes is in the block of wood and 
<A NAME="231"></A>the half-line is in the whole, because it might be separated out, and we 
<A NAME="232"></A>call even the man who is not studying a man of science, if he is capable 
<A NAME="233"></A>of studying; the thing that stands in contrast to each of these exists 
<A NAME="234"></A>actually. Our meaning can be seen in the particular cases by induction, 
<A NAME="235"></A>and we must not seek a definition of everything but be content to grasp 
<A NAME="236"></A>the analogy, that it is as that which is building is to that which is capable 
<A NAME="237"></A>of building, and the waking to the sleeping, and that which is seeing to 
<A NAME="238"></A>that which has its eyes shut but has sight, and that which has been shaped 
<A NAME="239"></A>out of the matter to the matter, and that which has been wrought up to 
<A NAME="240"></A>the unwrought. Let actuality be defined by one member of this antithesis, 
<A NAME="241"></A>and the potential by the other. But all things are not said in the same 
<A NAME="242"></A>sense to exist actually, but only by analogy-as A is in B or to B, C is 
<A NAME="243"></A>in D or to D; for some are as movement to potency, and the others as substance 
<A NAME="244"></A>to some sort of matter. <BR><BR>"But also the infinite and the void and 
<A NAME="245"></A>all similar things are said to exist potentially and actually in a different 
<A NAME="246"></A>sense from that which applies to many other things, e.g. to that which 
<A NAME="247"></A>sees or walks or is seen. For of the latter class these predicates can 
<A NAME="248"></A>at some time be also truly asserted without qualification; for the seen 
<A NAME="249"></A>is so called sometimes because it is being seen, sometimes because it is 
<A NAME="250"></A>capable of being seen. But the infinite does not exist potentially in the 
<A NAME="251"></A>sense that it will ever actually have separate existence; it exists potentially 
<A NAME="252"></A>only for knowledge. For the fact that the process of dividing never comes 
<A NAME="253"></A>to an end ensures that this activity exists potentially, but not that the 
<A NAME="254"></A>infinite exists separately. <BR><BR>"Since of the actions which have a 
<A NAME="255"></A>limit none is an end but all are relative to the end, e.g. the removing 
<A NAME="256"></A>of fat, or fat-removal, and the bodily parts themselves when one is making 
<A NAME="257"></A>them thin are in movement in this way (i.e. without being already that 
<A NAME="258"></A>at which the movement aims), this is not an action or at least not a complete 
<A NAME="259"></A>one (for it is not an end); but that movement in which the end is present 
<A NAME="260"></A>is an action. E.g. at the same time we are seeing and have seen, are understanding 
<A NAME="261"></A>and have understood, are thinking and have thought (while it is not true 
<A NAME="262"></A>that at the same time we are learning and have learnt, or are being cured 
<A NAME="263"></A>and have been cured). At the same time we are living well and have lived 
<A NAME="264"></A>well, and are happy and have been happy. If not, the process would have 
<A NAME="265"></A>had sometime to cease, as the process of making thin ceases: but, as things 
<A NAME="266"></A>are, it does not cease; we are living and have lived. Of these processes, 
<A NAME="267"></A>then, we must call the one set movements, and the other actualities. For 
<A NAME="268"></A>every movement is incomplete-making thin, learning, walking, building; 
<A NAME="269"></A>these are movements, and incomplete at that. For it is not true that at 
<A NAME="270"></A>the same time a thing is walking and has walked, or is building and has 
<A NAME="271"></A>built, or is coming to be and has come to be, or is being moved and has 
<A NAME="272"></A>been moved, but what is being moved is different from what has been moved, 
<A NAME="273"></A>and what is moving from what has moved. But it is the same thing that at 
<A NAME="274"></A>the same time has seen and is seeing, seeing, or is thinking and has thought. 
<A NAME="275"></A>The latter sort of process, then, I call an actuality, and the former a 
<A NAME="276"></A>movement.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="277"></A><B>Part 7</B>
<A NAME="278"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>"What, and what kind of thing, the actual is, may be taken as explained 
<A NAME="280"></A>by these and similar considerations. But we must distinguish when a thing 
<A NAME="281"></A>exists potentially and when it does not; for it is not at any and every 
<A NAME="282"></A>time. E.g. is earth potentially a man? No-but rather when it has already 
<A NAME="283"></A>become seed, and perhaps not even then. It is just as it is with being 
<A NAME="284"></A>healed; not everything can be healed by the medical art or by luck, but 
<A NAME="285"></A>there is a certain kind of thing which is capable of it, and only this 
<A NAME="286"></A>is potentially healthy. And (1) the delimiting mark of that which as a 
<A NAME="287"></A>result of thought comes to exist in complete reality from having existed 
<A NAME="288"></A>potentially is that if the agent has willed it it comes to pass if nothing 
<A NAME="289"></A>external hinders, while the condition on the other side-viz. in that which 
<A NAME="290"></A>is healed-is that nothing in it hinders the result. It is on similar terms 
<A NAME="291"></A>that we have what is potentially a house; if nothing in the thing acted 
<A NAME="292"></A>on-i.e. in the matter-prevents it from becoming a house, and if there is 
<A NAME="293"></A>nothing which must be added or taken away or changed, this is potentially 
<A NAME="294"></A>a house; and the same is true of all other things the source of whose becoming 
<A NAME="295"></A>is external. And (2) in the cases in which the source of the becoming is 
<A NAME="296"></A>in the very thing which comes to be, a thing is potentially all those things 
<A NAME="297"></A>which it will be of itself if nothing external hinders it. E.g. the seed 
<A NAME="298"></A>is not yet potentially a man; for it must be deposited in something other 
<A NAME="299"></A>than itself and undergo a change. But when through its own motive principle 
<A NAME="300"></A>it has already got such and such attributes, in this state it is already 
<A NAME="301"></A>potentially a man; while in the former state it needs another motive principle, 
<A NAME="302"></A>just as earth is not yet potentially a statue (for it must first change 
<A NAME="303"></A>in order to become brass.) <BR><BR>"It seems that when we call a thing 
<A NAME="304"></A>not something else but 'thaten'-e.g. a casket is not 'wood' but 'wooden', 
<A NAME="305"></A>and wood is not 'earth' but 'earthen', and again earth will illustrate 
<A NAME="306"></A>our point if it is similarly not something else but 'thaten'-that other 
<A NAME="307"></A>thing is always potentially (in the full sense of that word) the thing 
<A NAME="308"></A>which comes after it in this series. E.g. a casket is not 'earthen' nor 
<A NAME="309"></A>'earth', but 'wooden'; for this is potentially a casket and this is the 
<A NAME="310"></A>matter of a casket, wood in general of a casket in general, and this particular 
<A NAME="311"></A>wood of this particular casket. And if there is a first thing, which is 
<A NAME="312"></A>no longer, in reference to something else, called 'thaten', this is prime 
<A NAME="313"></A>matter; e.g. if earth is 'airy' and air is not 'fire' but 'fiery', fire 
<A NAME="314"></A>is prime matter, which is not a 'this'. For the subject or substratum is 
<A NAME="315"></A>differentiated by being a 'this' or not being one; i.e. the substratum 
<A NAME="316"></A>of modifications is, e.g. a man, i.e. a body and a soul, while the modification 
<A NAME="317"></A>is 'musical' or 'pale'. (The subject is called, when music comes to be 
<A NAME="318"></A>present in it, not 'music' but 'musical', and the man is not 'paleness' 
<A NAME="319"></A>but 'pale', and not 'ambulation' or 'movement' but 'walking' or 'moving',-which 
<A NAME="320"></A>is akin to the 'thaten'.) Wherever this is so, then, the ultimate subject 
<A NAME="321"></A>is a substance; but when this is not so but the predicate is a form and 
<A NAME="322"></A>a 'this', the ultimate subject is matter and material substance. And it 
<A NAME="323"></A>is only right that 'thaten' should be used with reference both to the matter 
<A NAME="324"></A>and to the accidents; for both are indeterminates. <BR><BR>"We have stated, 
<A NAME="325"></A>then, when a thing is to be said to exist potentially and when it is 
<A NAME="326"></A>not.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="327"></A><B>Part 8</B>
<A NAME="328"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>"From our discussion of the various senses of 'prior', it is clear 
<A NAME="330"></A>that actuality is prior to potency. And I mean by potency not only that 
<A NAME="331"></A>definite kind which is said to be a principle of change in another thing 
<A NAME="332"></A>or in the thing itself regarded as other, but in general every principle 
<A NAME="333"></A>of movement or of rest. For nature also is in the same genus as potency; 
<A NAME="334"></A>for it is a principle of movement-not, however, in something else but in 
<A NAME="335"></A>the thing itself qua itself. To all such potency, then, actuality is prior 
<A NAME="336"></A>both in formula and in substantiality; and in time it is prior in one sense, 
<A NAME="337"></A>and in another not. <BR><BR>"(1) Clearly it is prior in formula; for that 
<A NAME="338"></A>which is in the primary sense potential is potential because it is possible 
<A NAME="339"></A>for it to become active; e.g. I mean by 'capable of building' that which 
<A NAME="340"></A>can build, and by 'capable of seeing' that which can see, and by 'visible' 
<A NAME="341"></A>that which can be seen. And the same account applies to all other cases, 
<A NAME="342"></A>so that the formula and the knowledge of the one must precede the knowledge 
<A NAME="343"></A>of the other. <BR><BR>"(2) In time it is prior in this sense: the actual 
<A NAME="344"></A>which is identical in species though not in number with a potentially existing 
<A NAME="345"></A>thing is to it. I mean that to this particular man who now exists actually 
<A NAME="346"></A>and to the corn and to the seeing subject the matter and the seed and that 
<A NAME="347"></A>which is capable of seeing, which are potentially a man and corn and seeing, 
<A NAME="348"></A>but not yet actually so, are prior in time; but prior in time to these 
<A NAME="349"></A>are other actually existing things, from which they were produced. For 
<A NAME="350"></A>from the potentially existing the actually existing is always produced 
<A NAME="351"></A>by an actually existing thing, e.g. man from man, musician by musician; 
<A NAME="352"></A>there is always a first mover, and the mover already exists actually. We 
<A NAME="353"></A>have said in our account of substance that everything that is produced 
<A NAME="354"></A>is something produced from something and by something, and that the same 
<A NAME="355"></A>in species as it. <BR><BR>"This is why it is thought impossible to be a 
<A NAME="356"></A>builder if one has built nothing or a harper if one has never played the 
<A NAME="357"></A>harp; for he who learns to play the harp learns to play it by playing it, 
<A NAME="358"></A>and all other learners do similarly. And thence arose the sophistical quibble, 
<A NAME="359"></A>that one who does not possess a science will be doing that which is the 
<A NAME="360"></A>object of the science; for he who is learning it does not possess it. But 
<A NAME="361"></A>since, of that which is coming to be, some part must have come to be, and, 
<A NAME="362"></A>of that which, in general, is changing, some part must have changed (this 
<A NAME="363"></A>is shown in the treatise on movement), he who is learning must, it would 
<A NAME="364"></A>seem, possess some part of the science. But here too, then, it is clear 
<A NAME="365"></A>that actuality is in this sense also, viz. in order of generation and of 
<A NAME="366"></A>time, prior to potency. <BR><BR>"But (3) it is also prior in substantiality; 
<A NAME="367"></A>firstly, (a) because the things that are posterior in becoming are prior 
<A NAME="368"></A>in form and in substantiality (e.g. man is prior to boy and human being 
<A NAME="369"></A>to seed; for the one already has its form, and the other has not), and 
<A NAME="370"></A>because everything that comes to be moves towards a principle, i.e. an 
<A NAME="371"></A>end (for that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the 
<A NAME="372"></A>becoming is for the sake of the end), and the actuality is the end, and 
<A NAME="373"></A>it is for the sake of this that the potency is acquired. For animals do 
<A NAME="374"></A>not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they 
<A NAME="375"></A>may see. And similarly men have the art of building that they may build, 
<A NAME="376"></A>and theoretical science that they may theorize; but they do not theorize 
<A NAME="377"></A>that they may have theoretical science, except those who are learning by 
<A NAME="378"></A>practice; and these do not theorize except in a limited sense, or because 
<A NAME="379"></A>they have no need to theorize. Further, matter exists in a potential state, 
<A NAME="380"></A>just because it may come to its form; and when it exists actually, then 
<A NAME="381"></A>it is in its form. And the same holds good in all cases, even those in 
<A NAME="382"></A>which the end is a movement. And so, as teachers think they have achieved 
<A NAME="383"></A>their end when they have exhibited the pupil at work, nature does likewise. 
<A NAME="384"></A>For if this is not the case, we shall have Pauson's Hermes over again, 
<A NAME="385"></A>since it will be hard to say about the knowledge, as about the figure in 
<A NAME="386"></A>the picture, whether it is within or without. For the action is the end, 
<A NAME="387"></A>and the actuality is the action. And so even the word 'actuality' is derived 
<A NAME="388"></A>from 'action', and points to the complete reality. <BR><BR>"And while in 
<A NAME="389"></A>some cases the exercise is the ultimate thing (e.g. in sight the ultimate 
<A NAME="390"></A>thing is seeing, and no other product besides this results from sight), 
<A NAME="391"></A>but from some things a product follows (e.g. from the art of building there 
<A NAME="392"></A>results a house as well as the act of building), yet none the less the 
<A NAME="393"></A>act is in the former case the end and in the latter more of an end than 
<A NAME="394"></A>the potency is. For the act of building is realized in the thing that is 
<A NAME="395"></A>being built, and comes to be, and is, at the same time as the house. <BR><BR>"Where, 
<A NAME="396"></A>then, the result is something apart from the exercise, the actuality is 
<A NAME="397"></A>in the thing that is being made, e.g. the act of building is in the thing 
<A NAME="398"></A>that is being built and that of weaving in the thing that is being woven, 
<A NAME="399"></A>and similarly in all other cases, and in general the movement is in the 
<A NAME="400"></A>thing that is being moved; but where there is no product apart from the 
<A NAME="401"></A>actuality, the actuality is present in the agents, e.g. the act of seeing 
<A NAME="402"></A>is in the seeing subject and that of theorizing in the theorizing subject 
<A NAME="403"></A>and the life is in the soul (and therefore well-being also; for it is a 
<A NAME="404"></A>certain kind of life). <BR><BR>"Obviously, therefore, the substance or 
<A NAME="405"></A>form is actuality. According to this argument, then, it is obvious that 
<A NAME="406"></A>actuality is prior in substantial being to potency; and as we have said, 
<A NAME="407"></A>one actuality always precedes another in time right back to the actuality 
<A NAME="408"></A>of the eternal prime mover. <BR><BR>"But (b) actuality is prior in a stricter 
<A NAME="409"></A>sense also; for eternal things are prior in substance to perishable things, 
<A NAME="410"></A>and no eternal thing exists potentially. The reason is this. Every potency 
<A NAME="411"></A>is at one and the same time a potency of the opposite; for, while that 
<A NAME="412"></A>which is not capable of being present in a subject cannot be present, everything 
<A NAME="413"></A>that is capable of being may possibly not be actual. That, then, which 
<A NAME="414"></A>is capable of being may either be or not be; the same thing, then, is capable 
<A NAME="415"></A>both of being and of not being. And that which is capable of not being 
<A NAME="416"></A>may possibly not be; and that which may possibly not be is perishable, 
<A NAME="417"></A>either in the full sense, or in the precise sense in which it is said that 
<A NAME="418"></A>it possibly may not be, i.e. in respect either of place or of quantity 
<A NAME="419"></A>or quality; 'in the full sense' means 'in respect of substance'. Nothing, 
<A NAME="420"></A>then, which is in the full sense imperishable is in the full sense potentially 
<A NAME="421"></A>existent (though there is nothing to prevent its being so in some respect, 
<A NAME="422"></A>e.g. potentially of a certain quality or in a certain place); all imperishable 
<A NAME="423"></A>things, then, exist actually. Nor can anything which is of necessity exist 
<A NAME="424"></A>potentially; yet these things are primary; for if these did not exist, 
<A NAME="425"></A>nothing would exist. Nor does eternal movement, if there be such, exist 
<A NAME="426"></A>potentially; and, if there is an eternal mobile, it is not in motion in 
<A NAME="427"></A>virtue of a potentiality, except in respect of 'whence' and 'whither' (there 
<A NAME="428"></A>is nothing to prevent its having matter which makes it capable of movement 
<A NAME="429"></A>in various directions). And so the sun and the stars and the whole heaven 
<A NAME="430"></A>are ever active, and there is no fear that they may sometime stand still, 
<A NAME="431"></A>as the natural philosophers fear they may. Nor do they tire in this activity; 
<A NAME="432"></A>for movement is not for them, as it is for perishable things, connected 
<A NAME="433"></A>with the potentiality for opposites, so that the continuity of the movement 
<A NAME="434"></A>should be laborious; for it is that kind of substance which is matter and 
<A NAME="435"></A>potency, not actuality, that causes this. <BR><BR>"Imperishable things 
<A NAME="436"></A>are imitated by those that are involved in change, e.g. earth and fire. 
<A NAME="437"></A>For these also are ever active; for they have their movement of themselves 
<A NAME="438"></A>and in themselves. But the other potencies, according to our previous discussion, 
<A NAME="439"></A>are all potencies for opposites; for that which can move another in this 
<A NAME="440"></A>way can also move it not in this way, i.e. if it acts according to a rational 
<A NAME="441"></A>formula; and the same non-rational potencies will produce opposite results 
<A NAME="442"></A>by their presence or absence. <BR><BR>"If, then, there are any entities 
<A NAME="443"></A>or substances such as the dialecticians say the Ideas are, there must be 
<A NAME="444"></A>something much more scientific than science-itself and something more mobile 
<A NAME="445"></A>than movement-itself; for these will be more of the nature of actualities, 
<A NAME="446"></A>while science-itself and movement-itself are potencies for these. <BR><BR>"Obviously, 
<A NAME="447"></A>then, actuality is prior both to potency and to every principle of 
<A NAME="448"></A>change.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="449"></A><B>Part 9</B>
<A NAME="450"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>"That the actuality is also better and more valuable than the good 
<A NAME="452"></A>potency is evident from the following argument. Everything of which we 
<A NAME="453"></A>say that it can do something, is alike capable of contraries, e.g. that 
<A NAME="454"></A>of which we say that it can be well is the same as that which can be ill, 
<A NAME="455"></A>and has both potencies at once; for the same potency is a potency of health 
<A NAME="456"></A>and illness, of rest and motion, of building and throwing down, of being 
<A NAME="457"></A>built and being thrown down. The capacity for contraries, then, is present 
<A NAME="458"></A>at the same time; but contraries cannot be present at the same time, and 
<A NAME="459"></A>the actualities also cannot be present at the same time, e.g. health and 
<A NAME="460"></A>illness. Therefore, while the good must be one of them, the capacity is 
<A NAME="461"></A>both alike, or neither; the actuality, then, is better. Also in the case 
<A NAME="462"></A>of bad things the end or actuality must be worse than the potency; for 
<A NAME="463"></A>that which 'can' is both contraries alike. Clearly, then, the bad does 
<A NAME="464"></A>not exist apart from bad things; for the bad is in its nature posterior 
<A NAME="465"></A>to the potency. And therefore we may also say that in the things which 
<A NAME="466"></A>are from the beginning, i.e. in eternal things, there is nothing bad, nothing 
<A NAME="467"></A>defective, nothing perverted (for perversion is something bad). <BR><BR>"It 
<A NAME="468"></A>is an activity also that geometrical constructions are discovered; for 
<A NAME="469"></A>we find them by dividing. If the figures had been already divided, the 
<A NAME="470"></A>constructions would have been obvious; but as it is they are present only 
<A NAME="471"></A>potentially. Why are the angles of the triangle equal to two right angles? 
<A NAME="472"></A>Because the angles about one point are equal to two right angles. If, then, 
<A NAME="473"></A>the line parallel to the side had been already drawn upwards, the reason 
<A NAME="474"></A>would have been evident to any one as soon as he saw the figure. Why is 
<A NAME="475"></A>the angle in a semicircle in all cases a right angle? If three lines are 
<A NAME="476"></A>equal the two which form the base, and the perpendicular from the centre-the 
<A NAME="477"></A>conclusion is evident at a glance to one who knows the former proposition. 
<A NAME="478"></A>Obviously, therefore, the potentially existing constructions are discovered 
<A NAME="479"></A>by being brought to actuality; the reason is that the geometer's thinking 
<A NAME="480"></A>is an actuality; so that the potency proceeds from an actuality; and therefore 
<A NAME="481"></A>it is by making constructions that people come to know them (though the 
<A NAME="482"></A>single actuality is later in generation than the corresponding potency). 
<A NAME="483"></A>(See diagram.)
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="484"></A><B>Part 10</B>
<A NAME="485"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>"The terms 'being' and 'non-being' are employed firstly with reference 
<A NAME="487"></A>to the categories, and secondly with reference to the potency or actuality 
<A NAME="488"></A>of these or their non-potency or nonactuality, and thirdly in the sense 
<A NAME="489"></A>of true and false. This depends, on the side of the objects, on their being 
<A NAME="490"></A>combined or separated, so that he who thinks the separated to be separated 
<A NAME="491"></A>and the combined to be combined has the truth, while he whose thought is 
<A NAME="492"></A>in a state contrary to that of the objects is in error. This being so, 
<A NAME="493"></A>when is what is called truth or falsity present, and when is it not? We 
<A NAME="494"></A>must consider what we mean by these terms. It is not because we think truly 
<A NAME="495"></A>that you are pale, that you are pale, but because you are pale we who say 
<A NAME="496"></A>this have the truth. If, then, some things are always combined and cannot 
<A NAME="497"></A>be separated, and others are always separated and cannot be combined, while 
<A NAME="498"></A>others are capable either of combination or of separation, 'being' is being 
<A NAME="499"></A>combined and one, and 'not being' is being not combined but more than one. 
<A NAME="500"></A>Regarding contingent facts, then, the same opinion or the same statement 
<A NAME="501"></A>comes to be false and true, and it is possible for it to be at one time 
<A NAME="502"></A>correct and at another erroneous; but regarding things that cannot be otherwise 
<A NAME="503"></A>opinions are not at one time true and at another false, but the same opinions 
<A NAME="504"></A>are always true or always false. <BR><BR>"But with regard to incomposites, 
<A NAME="505"></A>what is being or not being, and truth or falsity? A thing of this sort 
<A NAME="506"></A>is not composite, so as to 'be' when it is compounded, and not to 'be' 
<A NAME="507"></A>if it is separated, like 'that the wood is white' or 'that the diagonal 
<A NAME="508"></A>is incommensurable'; nor will truth and falsity be still present in the 
<A NAME="509"></A>same way as in the previous cases. In fact, as truth is not the same in 
<A NAME="510"></A>these cases, so also being is not the same; but (a) truth or falsity is 
<A NAME="511"></A>as follows--contact and assertion are truth (assertion not being the same 
<A NAME="512"></A>as affirmation), and ignorance is non-contact. For it is not possible to 
<A NAME="513"></A>be in error regarding the question what a thing is, save in an accidental 
<A NAME="514"></A>sense; and the same holds good regarding non-composite substances (for 
<A NAME="515"></A>it is not possible to be in error about them). And they all exist actually, 
<A NAME="516"></A>not potentially; for otherwise they would have come to be and ceased to 
<A NAME="517"></A>be; but, as it is, being itself does not come to be (nor cease to be); 
<A NAME="518"></A>for if it had done so it would have had to come out of something. About 
<A NAME="519"></A>the things, then, which are essences and actualities, it is not possible 
<A NAME="520"></A>to be in error, but only to know them or not to know them. But we do inquire 
<A NAME="521"></A>what they are, viz. whether they are of such and such a nature or not. 
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>"(b) As regards the 'being' that answers to truth and the 'non-being' 
<A NAME="523"></A>that answers to falsity, in one case there is truth if the subject and 
<A NAME="524"></A>the attribute are really combined, and falsity if they are not combined; 
<A NAME="525"></A>in the other case, if the object is existent it exists in a particular 
<A NAME="526"></A>way, and if it does not exist in this way does not exist at all. And truth 
<A NAME="527"></A>means knowing these objects, and falsity does not exist, nor error, but 
<A NAME="528"></A>only ignorance-and not an ignorance which is like blindness; for blindness 
<A NAME="529"></A>is akin to a total absence of the faculty of thinking. <BR><BR>"It is evident 
<A NAME="530"></A>also that about unchangeable things there can be no error in respect of 
<A NAME="531"></A>time, if we assume them to be unchangeable. E.g. if we suppose that the 
<A NAME="532"></A>triangle does not change, we shall not suppose that at one time its angles 
<A NAME="533"></A>are equal to two right angles while at another time they are not (for that 
<A NAME="534"></A>would imply change). It is possible, however, to suppose that one member 
<A NAME="535"></A>of such a class has a certain attribute and another has not; e.g. while 
<A NAME="536"></A>we may suppose that no even number is prime, we may suppose that some are 
<A NAME="537"></A>and some are not. But regarding a numerically single number not even this 
<A NAME="538"></A>form of error is possible; for we cannot in this case suppose that one 
<A NAME="539"></A>instance has an attribute and another has not, but whether our judgement 
<A NAME="540"></A>be true or false, it is implied that the fact is eternal.
