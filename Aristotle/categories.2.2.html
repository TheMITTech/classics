<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 7</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Those things are called relative, which, being either said to be of something 
<A NAME="12"></A>else or related to something else, are explained by reference to that other 
<A NAME="13"></A>thing. For instance, the word 'superior' is explained by reference to something 
<A NAME="14"></A>else, for it is superiority over something else that is meant. Similarly, 
<A NAME="15"></A>the expression 'double' has this external reference, for it is the double 
<A NAME="16"></A>of something else that is meant. So it is with everything else of this 
<A NAME="17"></A>kind. There are, moreover, other relatives, e.g. habit, disposition, perception, 
<A NAME="18"></A>knowledge, and attitude. The significance of all these is explained by 
<A NAME="19"></A>a reference to something else and in no other way. Thus, a habit is a habit 
<A NAME="20"></A>of something, knowledge is knowledge of something, attitude is the attitude 
<A NAME="21"></A>of something. So it is with all other relatives that have been mentioned. 
<A NAME="22"></A>Those terms, then, are called relative, the nature of which is explained 
<A NAME="23"></A>by reference to something else, the preposition 'of' or some other preposition 
<A NAME="24"></A>being used to indicate the relation. Thus, one mountain is called great 
<A NAME="25"></A>in comparison with son with another; for the mountain claims this attribute 
<A NAME="26"></A>by comparison with something. Again, that which is called similar must 
<A NAME="27"></A>be similar to something else, and all other such attributes have this external 
<A NAME="28"></A>reference. It is to be noted that lying and standing and sitting are particular 
<A NAME="29"></A>attitudes, but attitude is itself a relative term. To lie, to stand, to 
<A NAME="30"></A>be seated, are not themselves attitudes, but take their name from the aforesaid 
<A NAME="31"></A>attitudes.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>It is possible for relatives to have contraries. Thus virtue has 
<A NAME="33"></A>a contrary, vice, these both being relatives; knowledge, too, has a contrary, 
<A NAME="34"></A>ignorance. But this is not the mark of all relatives; 'double' and 'triple' 
<A NAME="35"></A>have no contrary, nor indeed has any such term.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>It also appears that relatives can admit of variation of degree. 
<A NAME="37"></A>For 'like' and 'unlike', 'equal' and 'unequal', have the modifications 
<A NAME="38"></A>'more' and 'less' applied to them, and each of these is relative in character: 
<A NAME="39"></A>for the terms 'like' and 'unequal' bear 'unequal' bear a reference to something 
<A NAME="40"></A>external. Yet, again, it is not every relative term that admits of variation 
<A NAME="41"></A>of degree. No term such as 'double' admits of this modification. All relatives 
<A NAME="42"></A>have correlatives: by the term 'slave' we mean the slave of a master, by 
<A NAME="43"></A>the term 'master', the master of a slave; by 'double', the double of its 
<A NAME="44"></A>hall; by 'half', the half of its double; by 'greater', greater than that 
<A NAME="45"></A>which is less; by 'less,' less than that which is greater.
<A NAME="46"></A><BR><BR>So it is with every other relative term; but the case we use to 
<A NAME="47"></A>express the correlation differs in some instances. Thus, by knowledge we 
<A NAME="48"></A>mean knowledge the knowable; by the knowable, that which is to be apprehended 
<A NAME="49"></A>by knowledge; by perception, perception of the perceptible; by the perceptible, 
<A NAME="50"></A>that which is apprehended by perception.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>Sometimes, however, reciprocity of correlation does not appear 
<A NAME="52"></A>to exist. This comes about when a blunder is made, and that to which the 
<A NAME="53"></A>relative is related is not accurately stated. If a man states that a wing 
<A NAME="54"></A>is necessarily relative to a bird, the connexion between these two will 
<A NAME="55"></A>not be reciprocal, for it will not be possible to say that a bird is a 
<A NAME="56"></A>bird by reason of its wings. The reason is that the original statement 
<A NAME="57"></A>was inaccurate, for the wing is not said to be relative to the bird qua 
<A NAME="58"></A>bird, since many creatures besides birds have wings, but qua winged creature. 
<A NAME="59"></A>If, then, the statement is made accurate, the connexion will be reciprocal, 
<A NAME="60"></A>for we can speak of a wing, having reference necessarily to a winged creature, 
<A NAME="61"></A>and of a winged creature as being such because of its 
<A NAME="62"></A>wings.
<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>Occasionally, perhaps, it is necessary to coin words, if no word 
<A NAME="64"></A>exists by which a correlation can adequately be explained. If we define 
<A NAME="65"></A>a rudder as necessarily having reference to a boat, our definition will 
<A NAME="66"></A>not be appropriate, for the rudder does not have this reference to a boat 
<A NAME="67"></A>qua boat, as there are boats which have no rudders. Thus we cannot use 
<A NAME="68"></A>the terms reciprocally, for the word 'boat' cannot be said to find its 
<A NAME="69"></A>explanation in the word 'rudder'. As there is no existing word, our definition 
<A NAME="70"></A>would perhaps be more accurate if we coined some word like 'ruddered' as 
<A NAME="71"></A>the correlative of 'rudder'. If we express ourselves thus accurately, at 
<A NAME="72"></A>any rate the terms are reciprocally connected, for the 'ruddered' thing 
<A NAME="73"></A>is 'ruddered' in virtue of its rudder. So it is in all other cases. A head 
<A NAME="74"></A>will be more accurately defined as the correlative of that which is 'headed', 
<A NAME="75"></A>than as that of an animal, for the animal does not have a head qua animal, 
<A NAME="76"></A>since many animals have no head.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>Thus we may perhaps most easily comprehend that to which a thing 
<A NAME="78"></A>is related, when a name does not exist, if, from that which has a name, 
<A NAME="79"></A>we derive a new name, and apply it to that with which the first is reciprocally 
<A NAME="80"></A>connected, as in the aforesaid instances, when we derived the word 'winged' 
<A NAME="81"></A>from 'wing' and from 'rudder'.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>All relatives, then, if properly defined, have a correlative. I 
<A NAME="83"></A>add this condition because, if that to which they are related is stated 
<A NAME="84"></A>as haphazard and not accurately, the two are not found to be interdependent. 
<A NAME="85"></A>Let me state what I mean more clearly. Even in the case of acknowledged 
<A NAME="86"></A>correlatives, and where names exist for each, there will be no interdependence 
<A NAME="87"></A>if one of the two is denoted, not by that name which expresses the correlative 
<A NAME="88"></A>notion, but by one of irrelevant significance. The term 'slave,' if defined 
<A NAME="89"></A>as related, not to a master, but to a man, or a biped, or anything of that 
<A NAME="90"></A>sort, is not reciprocally connected with that in relation to which it is 
<A NAME="91"></A>defined, for the statement is not exact. Further, if one thing is said 
<A NAME="92"></A>to be correlative with another, and the terminology used is correct, then, 
<A NAME="93"></A>though all irrelevant attributes should be removed, and only that one attribute 
<A NAME="94"></A>left in virtue of which it was correctly stated to be correlative with 
<A NAME="95"></A>that other, the stated correlation will still exist. If the correlative 
<A NAME="96"></A>of 'the slave' is said to be 'the master', then, though all irrelevant 
<A NAME="97"></A>attributes of the said 'master', such as 'biped', 'receptive of knowledge', 
<A NAME="98"></A>'human', should be removed, and the attribute 'master' alone left, the 
<A NAME="99"></A>stated correlation existing between him and the slave will remain the same, 
<A NAME="100"></A>for it is of a master that a slave is said to be the slave. On the other 
<A NAME="101"></A>hand, if, of two correlatives, one is not correctly termed, then, when 
<A NAME="102"></A>all other attributes are removed and that alone is left in virtue of which 
<A NAME="103"></A>it was stated to be correlative, the stated correlation will be found to 
<A NAME="104"></A>have disappeared.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>For suppose the correlative of 'the slave' should be said to be 
<A NAME="106"></A>'the man', or the correlative of 'the wing"the bird'; if the attribute 
<A NAME="107"></A>'master' be withdrawn from' the man', the correlation between 'the man' 
<A NAME="108"></A>and 'the slave' will cease to exist, for if the man is not a master, the 
<A NAME="109"></A>slave is not a slave. Similarly, if the attribute 'winged' be withdrawn 
<A NAME="110"></A>from 'the bird', 'the wing' will no longer be relative; for if the so-called 
<A NAME="111"></A>correlative is not winged, it follows that 'the wing' has no 
<A NAME="112"></A>correlative.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>Thus it is essential that the correlated terms should be exactly 
<A NAME="114"></A>designated; if there is a name existing, the statement will be easy; if 
<A NAME="115"></A>not, it is doubtless our duty to construct names. When the terminology 
<A NAME="116"></A>is thus correct, it is evident that all correlatives are 
<A NAME="117"></A>interdependent.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>Correlatives are thought to come into existence simultaneously. 
<A NAME="119"></A>This is for the most part true, as in the case of the double and the half. 
<A NAME="120"></A>The existence of the half necessitates the existence of that of which it 
<A NAME="121"></A>is a half. Similarly the existence of a master necessitates the existence 
<A NAME="122"></A>of a slave, and that of a slave implies that of a master; these are merely 
<A NAME="123"></A>instances of a general rule. Moreover, they cancel one another; for if 
<A NAME="124"></A>there is no double it follows that there is no half, and vice versa; this 
<A NAME="125"></A>rule also applies to all such correlatives. Yet it does not appear to be 
<A NAME="126"></A>true in all cases that correlatives come into existence simultaneously. 
<A NAME="127"></A>The object of knowledge would appear to exist before knowledge itself, 
<A NAME="128"></A>for it is usually the case that we acquire knowledge of objects already 
<A NAME="129"></A>existing; it would be difficult, if not impossible, to find a branch of 
<A NAME="130"></A>knowledge the beginning of the existence of which was contemporaneous with 
<A NAME="131"></A>that of its object.
<A NAME="132"></A><BR><BR>Again, while the object of knowledge, if it ceases to exist, cancels 
<A NAME="133"></A>at the same time the knowledge which was its correlative, the converse 
<A NAME="134"></A>of this is not true. It is true that if the object of knowledge does not 
<A NAME="135"></A>exist there can be no knowledge: for there will no longer be anything to 
<A NAME="136"></A>know. Yet it is equally true that, if knowledge of a certain object does 
<A NAME="137"></A>not exist, the object may nevertheless quite well exist. Thus, in the case 
<A NAME="138"></A>of the squaring of the circle, if indeed that process is an object of knowledge, 
<A NAME="139"></A>though it itself exists as an object of knowledge, yet the knowledge of 
<A NAME="140"></A>it has not yet come into existence. Again, if all animals ceased to exist, 
<A NAME="141"></A>there would be no knowledge, but there might yet be many objects of 
<A NAME="142"></A>knowledge.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>This is likewise the case with regard to perception: for the object 
<A NAME="144"></A>of perception is, it appears, prior to the act of perception. If the perceptible 
<A NAME="145"></A>is annihilated, perception also will cease to exist; but the annihilation 
<A NAME="146"></A>of perception does not cancel the existence of the perceptible. For perception 
<A NAME="147"></A>implies a body perceived and a body in which perception takes place. Now 
<A NAME="148"></A>if that which is perceptible is annihilated, it follows that the body is 
<A NAME="149"></A>annihilated, for the body is a perceptible thing; and if the body does 
<A NAME="150"></A>not exist, it follows that perception also ceases to exist. Thus the annihilation 
<A NAME="151"></A>of the perceptible involves that of perception.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>But the annihilation of perception does not involve that of the 
<A NAME="153"></A>perceptible. For if the animal is annihilated, it follows that perception 
<A NAME="154"></A>also is annihilated, but perceptibles such as body, heat, sweetness, bitterness, 
<A NAME="155"></A>and so on, will remain.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>Again, perception is generated at the same time as the perceiving 
<A NAME="157"></A>subject, for it comes into existence at the same time as the animal. But 
<A NAME="158"></A>the perceptible surely exists before perception; for fire and water and 
<A NAME="159"></A>such elements, out of which the animal is itself composed, exist before 
<A NAME="160"></A>the animal is an animal at all, and before perception. Thus it would seem 
<A NAME="161"></A>that the perceptible exists before perception.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>It may be questioned whether it is true that no substance is relative, 
<A NAME="163"></A>as seems to be the case, or whether exception is to be made in the case 
<A NAME="164"></A>of certain secondary substances. With regard to primary substances, it 
<A NAME="165"></A>is quite true that there is no such possibility, for neither wholes nor 
<A NAME="166"></A>parts of primary substances are relative. The individual man or ox is not 
<A NAME="167"></A>defined with reference to something external. Similarly with the parts: 
<A NAME="168"></A>a particular hand or head is not defined as a particular hand or head of 
<A NAME="169"></A>a particular person, but as the hand or head of a particular person. It 
<A NAME="170"></A>is true also, for the most part at least, in the case of secondary substances; 
<A NAME="171"></A>the species 'man' and the species 'ox' are not defined with reference to 
<A NAME="172"></A>anything outside themselves. Wood, again, is only relative in so far as 
<A NAME="173"></A>it is some one's property, not in so far as it is wood. It is plain, then, 
<A NAME="174"></A>that in the cases mentioned substance is not relative. But with regard 
<A NAME="175"></A>to some secondary substances there is a difference of opinion; thus, such 
<A NAME="176"></A>terms as 'head' and 'hand' are defined with reference to that of which 
<A NAME="177"></A>the things indicated are a part, and so it comes about that these appear 
<A NAME="178"></A>to have a relative character. Indeed, if our definition of that which is 
<A NAME="179"></A>relative was complete, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to prove 
<A NAME="180"></A>that no substance is relative. If, however, our definition was not complete, 
<A NAME="181"></A>if those things only are properly called relative in the case of which 
<A NAME="182"></A>relation to an external object is a necessary condition of existence, perhaps 
<A NAME="183"></A>some explanation of the dilemma may be found.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>The former definition does indeed apply to all relatives, but the 
<A NAME="185"></A>fact that a thing is explained with reference to something else does not 
<A NAME="186"></A>make it essentially relative.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>From this it is plain that, if a man definitely apprehends a relative 
<A NAME="188"></A>thing, he will also definitely apprehend that to which it is relative. 
<A NAME="189"></A>Indeed this is self-evident: for if a man knows that some particular thing 
<A NAME="190"></A>is relative, assuming that we call that a relative in the case of which 
<A NAME="191"></A>relation to something is a necessary condition of existence, he knows that 
<A NAME="192"></A>also to which it is related. For if he does not know at all that to which 
<A NAME="193"></A>it is related, he will not know whether or not it is relative. This is 
<A NAME="194"></A>clear, moreover, in particular instances. If a man knows definitely that 
<A NAME="195"></A>such and such a thing is 'double', he will also forthwith know definitely 
<A NAME="196"></A>that of which it is the double. For if there is nothing definite of which 
<A NAME="197"></A>he knows it to be the double, he does not know at all that it is double. 
<A NAME="198"></A>Again, if he knows that a thing is more beautiful, it follows necessarily 
<A NAME="199"></A>that he will forthwith definitely know that also than which it is more 
<A NAME="200"></A>beautiful. He will not merely know indefinitely that it is more beautiful 
<A NAME="201"></A>than something which is less beautiful, for this would be supposition, 
<A NAME="202"></A>not knowledge. For if he does not know definitely that than which it is 
<A NAME="203"></A>more beautiful, he can no longer claim to know definitely that it is more 
<A NAME="204"></A>beautiful than something else which is less beautiful: for it might be 
<A NAME="205"></A>that nothing was less beautiful. It is, therefore, evident that if a man 
<A NAME="206"></A>apprehends some relative thing definitely, he necessarily knows that also 
<A NAME="207"></A>definitely to which it is related.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>Now the head, the hand, and such things are substances, and it 
<A NAME="209"></A>is possible to know their essential character definitely, but it does not 
<A NAME="210"></A>necessarily follow that we should know that to which they are related. 
<A NAME="211"></A>It is not possible to know forthwith whose head or hand is meant. Thus 
<A NAME="212"></A>these are not relatives, and, this being the case, it would be true to 
<A NAME="213"></A>say that no substance is relative in character. It is perhaps a difficult 
<A NAME="214"></A>matter, in such cases, to make a positive statement without more exhaustive 
<A NAME="215"></A>examination, but to have raised questions with regard to details is not 
<A NAME="216"></A>without advantage.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="217"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>By 'quality' I mean that in virtue of which people are said to 
<A NAME="219"></A>be such and such.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>Quality is a term that is used in many senses. One sort of quality 
<A NAME="221"></A>let us call 'habit' or 'disposition'. Habit differs from disposition in 
<A NAME="222"></A>being more lasting and more firmly established. The various kinds of knowledge 
<A NAME="223"></A>and of virtue are habits, for knowledge, even when acquired only in a moderate 
<A NAME="224"></A>degree, is, it is agreed, abiding in its character and difficult to displace, 
<A NAME="225"></A>unless some great mental upheaval takes place, through disease or any such 
<A NAME="226"></A>cause. The virtues, also, such as justice, self-restraint, and so on, are 
<A NAME="227"></A>not easily dislodged or dismissed, so as to give place to 
<A NAME="228"></A>vice.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>By a disposition, on the other hand, we mean a condition that is 
<A NAME="230"></A>easily changed and quickly gives place to its opposite. Thus, heat, cold, 
<A NAME="231"></A>disease, health, and so on are dispositions. For a man is disposed in one 
<A NAME="232"></A>way or another with reference to these, but quickly changes, becoming cold 
<A NAME="233"></A>instead of warm, ill instead of well. So it is with all other dispositions 
<A NAME="234"></A>also, unless through lapse of time a disposition has itself become inveterate 
<A NAME="235"></A>and almost impossible to dislodge: in which case we should perhaps go so 
<A NAME="236"></A>far as to call it a habit.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>It is evident that men incline to call those conditions habits 
<A NAME="238"></A>which are of a more or less permanent type and difficult to displace; for 
<A NAME="239"></A>those who are not retentive of knowledge, but volatile, are not said to 
<A NAME="240"></A>have such and such a 'habit' as regards knowledge, yet they are disposed, 
<A NAME="241"></A>we may say, either better or worse, towards knowledge. Thus habit differs 
<A NAME="242"></A>from disposition in this, that while the latter in ephemeral, the former 
<A NAME="243"></A>is permanent and difficult to alter.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>Habits are at the same time dispositions, but dispositions are 
<A NAME="245"></A>not necessarily habits. For those who have some specific habit may be said 
<A NAME="246"></A>also, in virtue of that habit, to be thus or thus disposed; but those who 
<A NAME="247"></A>are disposed in some specific way have not in all cases the corresponding 
<A NAME="248"></A>habit.
<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>Another sort of quality is that in virtue of which, for example, 
<A NAME="250"></A>we call men good boxers or runners, or healthy or sickly: in fact it includes 
<A NAME="251"></A>all those terms which refer to inborn capacity or incapacity. Such things 
<A NAME="252"></A>are not predicated of a person in virtue of his disposition, but in virtue 
<A NAME="253"></A>of his inborn capacity or incapacity to do something with ease or to avoid 
<A NAME="254"></A>defeat of any kind. Persons are called good boxers or good runners, not 
<A NAME="255"></A>in virtue of such and such a disposition, but in virtue of an inborn capacity 
<A NAME="256"></A>to accomplish something with ease. Men are called healthy in virtue of 
<A NAME="257"></A>the inborn capacity of easy resistance to those unhealthy influences that 
<A NAME="258"></A>may ordinarily arise; unhealthy, in virtue of the lack of this capacity. 
<A NAME="259"></A>Similarly with regard to softness and hardness. Hardness is predicated 
<A NAME="260"></A>of a thing because it has that capacity of resistance which enables it 
<A NAME="261"></A>to withstand disintegration; softness, again, is predicated of a thing 
<A NAME="262"></A>by reason of the lack of that capacity.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>A third class within this category is that of affective qualities 
<A NAME="264"></A>and affections. Sweetness, bitterness, sourness, are examples of this sort 
<A NAME="265"></A>of quality, together with all that is akin to these; heat, moreover, and 
<A NAME="266"></A>cold, whiteness, and blackness are affective qualities. It is evident that 
<A NAME="267"></A>these are qualities, for those things that possess them are themselves 
<A NAME="268"></A>said to be such and such by reason of their presence. Honey is called sweet 
<A NAME="269"></A>because it contains sweetness; the body is called white because it contains 
<A NAME="270"></A>whiteness; and so in all other cases.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>The term 'affective quality' is not used as indicating that those 
<A NAME="272"></A>things which admit these qualities are affected in any way. Honey is not 
<A NAME="273"></A>called sweet because it is affected in a specific way, nor is this what 
<A NAME="274"></A>is meant in any other instance. Similarly heat and cold are called affective 
<A NAME="275"></A>qualities, not because those things which admit them are affected. What 
<A NAME="276"></A>is meant is that these said qualities are capable of producing an 'affection' 
<A NAME="277"></A>in the way of perception. For sweetness has the power of affecting the 
<A NAME="278"></A>sense of taste; heat, that of touch; and so it is with the rest of these 
<A NAME="279"></A>qualities.
<A NAME="280"></A><BR><BR>Whiteness and blackness, however, and the other colours, are not 
<A NAME="281"></A>said to be affective qualities in this sense, but -because they themselves 
<A NAME="282"></A>are the results of an affection. It is plain that many changes of colour 
<A NAME="283"></A>take place because of affections. When a man is ashamed, he blushes; when 
<A NAME="284"></A>he is afraid, he becomes pale, and so on. So true is this, that when a 
<A NAME="285"></A>man is by nature liable to such affections, arising from some concomitance 
<A NAME="286"></A>of elements in his constitution, it is a probable inference that he has 
<A NAME="287"></A>the corresponding complexion of skin. For the same disposition of bodily 
<A NAME="288"></A>elements, which in the former instance was momentarily present in the case 
<A NAME="289"></A>of an access of shame, might be a result of a man's natural temperament, 
<A NAME="290"></A>so as to produce the corresponding colouring also as a natural characteristic. 
<A NAME="291"></A>All conditions, therefore, of this kind, if caused by certain permanent 
<A NAME="292"></A>and lasting affections, are called affective qualities. For pallor and 
<A NAME="293"></A>duskiness of complexion are called qualities, inasmuch as we are said to 
<A NAME="294"></A>be such and such in virtue of them, not only if they originate in natural 
<A NAME="295"></A>constitution, but also if they come about through long disease or sunburn, 
<A NAME="296"></A>and are difficult to remove, or indeed remain throughout life. For in the 
<A NAME="297"></A>same way we are said to be such and such because of 
<A NAME="298"></A>these.
<A NAME="299"></A><BR><BR>Those conditions, however, which arise from causes which may easily 
<A NAME="300"></A>be rendered ineffective or speedily removed, are called, not qualities, 
<A NAME="301"></A>but affections: for we are not said to be such virtue of them. The man 
<A NAME="302"></A>who blushes through shame is not said to be a constitutional blusher, nor 
<A NAME="303"></A>is the man who becomes pale through fear said to be constitutionally pale. 
<A NAME="304"></A>He is said rather to have been affected.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>Thus such conditions are called affections, not 
<A NAME="306"></A>qualities.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR>In like manner there are affective qualities and affections of the 
<A NAME="308"></A>soul. That temper with which a man is born and which has its origin in 
<A NAME="309"></A>certain deep-seated affections is called a quality. I mean such conditions 
<A NAME="310"></A>as insanity, irascibility, and so on: for people are said to be mad or 
<A NAME="311"></A>irascible in virtue of these. Similarly those abnormal psychic states which 
<A NAME="312"></A>are not inborn, but arise from the concomitance of certain other elements, 
<A NAME="313"></A>and are difficult to remove, or altogether permanent, are called qualities, 
<A NAME="314"></A>for in virtue of them men are said to be such and such.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>Those, however, which arise from causes easily rendered ineffective 
<A NAME="316"></A>are called affections, not qualities. Suppose that a man is irritable when 
<A NAME="317"></A>vexed: he is not even spoken of as a bad-tempered man, when in such circumstances 
<A NAME="318"></A>he loses his temper somewhat, but rather is said to be affected. Such conditions 
<A NAME="319"></A>are therefore termed, not qualities, but affections.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>The fourth sort of quality is figure and the shape that belongs 
<A NAME="321"></A>to a thing; and besides this, straightness and curvedness and any other 
<A NAME="322"></A>qualities of this type; each of these defines a thing as being such and 
<A NAME="323"></A>such. Because it is triangular or quadrangular a thing is said to have 
<A NAME="324"></A>a specific character, or again because it is straight or curved; in fact 
<A NAME="325"></A>a thing's shape in every case gives rise to a qualification of 
<A NAME="326"></A>it.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>Rarity and density, roughness and smoothness, seem to be terms 
<A NAME="328"></A>indicating quality: yet these, it would appear, really belong to a class 
<A NAME="329"></A>different from that of quality. For it is rather a certain relative position 
<A NAME="330"></A>of the parts composing the thing thus qualified which, it appears, is indicated 
<A NAME="331"></A>by each of these terms. A thing is dense, owing to the fact that its parts 
<A NAME="332"></A>are closely combined with one another; rare, because there are interstices 
<A NAME="333"></A>between the parts; smooth, because its parts lie, so to speak, evenly; 
<A NAME="334"></A>rough, because some parts project beyond others.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>There may be other sorts of quality, but those that are most properly 
<A NAME="336"></A>so called have, we may safely say, been enumerated.
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>These, then, are qualities, and the things that take their name 
<A NAME="338"></A>from them as derivatives, or are in some other way dependent on them, are 
<A NAME="339"></A>said to be qualified in some specific way. In most, indeed in almost all 
<A NAME="340"></A>cases, the name of that which is qualified is derived from that of the 
<A NAME="341"></A>quality. Thus the terms 'whiteness', 'grammar', 'justice', give us the 
<A NAME="342"></A>adjectives 'white', 'grammatical', 'just', and so on.
<A NAME="343"></A><BR><BR>There are some cases, however, in which, as the quality under consideration 
<A NAME="344"></A>has no name, it is impossible that those possessed of it should have a 
<A NAME="345"></A>name that is derivative. For instance, the name given to the runner or 
<A NAME="346"></A>boxer, who is so called in virtue of an inborn capacity, is not derived 
<A NAME="347"></A>from that of any quality; for lob those capacities have no name assigned 
<A NAME="348"></A>to them. In this, the inborn capacity is distinct from the science, with 
<A NAME="349"></A>reference to which men are called, e.g. boxers or wrestlers. Such a science 
<A NAME="350"></A>is classed as a disposition; it has a name, and is called 'boxing' or 'wrestling' 
<A NAME="351"></A>as the case may be, and the name given to those disposed in this way is 
<A NAME="352"></A>derived from that of the science. Sometimes, even though a name exists 
<A NAME="353"></A>for the quality, that which takes its character from the quality has a 
<A NAME="354"></A>name that is not a derivative. For instance, the upright man takes his 
<A NAME="355"></A>character from the possession of the quality of integrity, but the name 
<A NAME="356"></A>given him is not derived from the word 'integrity'. Yet this does not occur 
<A NAME="357"></A>often.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>We may therefore state that those things are said to be possessed 
<A NAME="359"></A>of some specific quality which have a name derived from that of the aforesaid 
<A NAME="360"></A>quality, or which are in some other way dependent on 
<A NAME="361"></A>it.
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR>One quality may be the contrary of another; thus justice is the 
<A NAME="363"></A>contrary of injustice, whiteness of blackness, and so on. The things, also, 
<A NAME="364"></A>which are said to be such and such in virtue of these qualities, may be 
<A NAME="365"></A>contrary the one to the other; for that which is unjust is contrary to 
<A NAME="366"></A>that which is just, that which is white to that which is black. This, however, 
<A NAME="367"></A>is not always the case. Red, yellow, and such colours, though qualities, 
<A NAME="368"></A>have no contraries.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>If one of two contraries is a quality, the other will also be a 
<A NAME="370"></A>quality. This will be evident from particular instances, if we apply the 
<A NAME="371"></A>names used to denote the other categories; for instance, granted that justice 
<A NAME="372"></A>is the contrary of injustice and justice is a quality, injustice will also 
<A NAME="373"></A>be a quality: neither quantity, nor relation, nor place, nor indeed any 
<A NAME="374"></A>other category but that of quality, will be applicable properly to injustice. 
<A NAME="375"></A>So it is with all other contraries falling under the category of 
<A NAME="376"></A>quality.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>Qualities admit of variation of degree. Whiteness is predicated 
<A NAME="378"></A>of one thing in a greater or less degree than of another. This is also 
<A NAME="379"></A>the case with reference to justice. Moreover, one and the same thing may 
<A NAME="380"></A>exhibit a quality in a greater degree than it did before: if a thing is 
<A NAME="381"></A>white, it may become whiter.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>Though this is generally the case, there are exceptions. For if 
<A NAME="383"></A>we should say that justice admitted of variation of degree, difficulties 
<A NAME="384"></A>might ensue, and this is true with regard to all those qualities which 
<A NAME="385"></A>are dispositions. There are some, indeed, who dispute the possibility of 
<A NAME="386"></A>variation here. They maintain that justice and health cannot very well 
<A NAME="387"></A>admit of variation of degree themselves, but that people vary in the degree 
<A NAME="388"></A>in which they possess these qualities, and that this is the case with grammatical 
<A NAME="389"></A>learning and all those qualities which are classed as dispositions. However 
<A NAME="390"></A>that may be, it is an incontrovertible fact that the things which in virtue 
<A NAME="391"></A>of these qualities are said to be what they are vary in the degree in which 
<A NAME="392"></A>they possess them; for one man is said to be better versed in grammar, 
<A NAME="393"></A>or more healthy or just, than another, and so on.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>The qualities expressed by the terms 'triangular' and 'quadrangular' 
<A NAME="395"></A>do not appear to admit of variation of degree, nor indeed do any that have 
<A NAME="396"></A>to do with figure. For those things to which the definition of the triangle 
<A NAME="397"></A>or circle is applicable are all equally triangular or circular. Those, 
<A NAME="398"></A>on the other hand, to which the same definition is not applicable, cannot 
<A NAME="399"></A>be said to differ from one another in degree; the square is no more a circle 
<A NAME="400"></A>than the rectangle, for to neither is the definition of the circle appropriate. 
<A NAME="401"></A>In short, if the definition of the term proposed is not applicable to both 
<A NAME="402"></A>objects, they cannot be compared. Thus it is not all qualities which admit 
<A NAME="403"></A>of variation of degree.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>Whereas none of the characteristics I have mentioned are peculiar 
<A NAME="405"></A>to quality, the fact that likeness and unlikeness can be predicated with 
<A NAME="406"></A>reference to quality only, gives to that category its distinctive feature. 
<A NAME="407"></A>One thing is like another only with reference to that in virtue of which 
<A NAME="408"></A>it is such and such; thus this forms the peculiar mark of 
<A NAME="409"></A>quality.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>We must not be disturbed because it may be argued that, though 
<A NAME="411"></A>proposing to discuss the category of quality, we have included in it many 
<A NAME="412"></A>relative terms. We did say that habits and dispositions were relative. 
<A NAME="413"></A>In practically all such cases the genus is relative, the individual not. 
<A NAME="414"></A>Thus knowledge, as a genus, is explained by reference to something else, 
<A NAME="415"></A>for we mean a knowledge of something. But particular branches of knowledge 
<A NAME="416"></A>are not thus explained. The knowledge of grammar is not relative to anything 
<A NAME="417"></A>external, nor is the knowledge of music, but these, if relative at all, 
<A NAME="418"></A>are relative only in virtue of their genera; thus grammar is said be the 
<A NAME="419"></A>knowledge of something, not the grammar of something; similarly music is 
<A NAME="420"></A>the knowledge of something, not the music of something.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>Thus individual branches of knowledge are not relative. And it 
<A NAME="422"></A>is because we possess these individual branches of knowledge that we are 
<A NAME="423"></A>said to be such and such. It is these that we actually possess: we are 
<A NAME="424"></A>called experts because we possess knowledge in some particular branch. 
<A NAME="425"></A>Those particular branches, therefore, of knowledge, in virtue of which 
<A NAME="426"></A>we are sometimes said to be such and such, are themselves qualities, and 
<A NAME="427"></A>are not relative. Further, if anything should happen to fall within both 
<A NAME="428"></A>the category of quality and that of relation, there would be nothing extraordinary 
<A NAME="429"></A>in classing it under both these heads.
