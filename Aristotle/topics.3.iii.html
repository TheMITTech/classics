<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>The question which is the more desirable, or the better, of two or more 
<A NAME="12"></A>things, should be examined upon the following lines: only first of all 
<A NAME="13"></A>it must be clearly laid down that the inquiry we are making concerns not 
<A NAME="14"></A>things that are widely divergent and that exhibit great differences from 
<A NAME="15"></A>one another (for nobody raises any doubt whether happiness or wealth is 
<A NAME="16"></A>more desirable), but things that are nearly related and about which we 
<A NAME="17"></A>commonly discuss for which of the two we ought rather to vote, because 
<A NAME="18"></A>we do not see any advantage on either side as compared with the other. 
<A NAME="19"></A>Clearly, in such cases if we can show a single advantage, or more than 
<A NAME="20"></A>one, our judgement will record our assent that whichever side happens to 
<A NAME="21"></A>have the advantage is the more desirable.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>First, then, that which is more lasting or secure is more desirable 
<A NAME="23"></A>than that which is less so: and so is that which is more likely to be chosen 
<A NAME="24"></A>by the prudent or by the good man or by the right law, or by men who are 
<A NAME="25"></A>good in any particular line, when they make their choice as such, or by 
<A NAME="26"></A>the experts in regard to any particular class of things; i.e. either whatever 
<A NAME="27"></A>most of them or what all of them would choose; e.g. in medicine or in carpentry 
<A NAME="28"></A>those things are more desirable which most, or all, doctors would choose; 
<A NAME="29"></A>or, in general, whatever most men or all men or all things would choose, 
<A NAME="30"></A>e.g. the good: for everything aims at the good. You should direct the argument 
<A NAME="31"></A>you intend to employ to whatever purpose you require. Of what is 'better' 
<A NAME="32"></A>or 'more desirable' the absolute standard is the verdict of the better 
<A NAME="33"></A>science, though relatively to a given individual the standard may be his 
<A NAME="34"></A>own particular science.
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>In the second place, that which is known as 'an x' is more desirable 
<A NAME="36"></A>than that which does not come within the genus 'x'-e.g. justice than a 
<A NAME="37"></A>just man; for the former falls within the genus 'good', whereas the other 
<A NAME="38"></A>does not, and the former is called 'a good', whereas the latter is not: 
<A NAME="39"></A>for nothing which does not happen to belong to the genus in question is 
<A NAME="40"></A>called by the generic name; e.g. a 'white man' is not 'a colour'. Likewise 
<A NAME="41"></A>also in other cases.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>Also, that which is desired for itself is more desirable than that 
<A NAME="43"></A>which is desired for something else; e.g. health is more desirable than 
<A NAME="44"></A>gymnastics: for the former is desired for itself, the latter for something 
<A NAME="45"></A>else. Also, that which is desirable in itself is more desirable than what 
<A NAME="46"></A>is desirable per accidens; e.g. justice in our friends than justice in 
<A NAME="47"></A>our enemies: for the former is desirable in itself, the latter per accidens: 
<A NAME="48"></A>for we desire that our enemies should be just per accidens, in order that 
<A NAME="49"></A>they may do us no harm. This last principle is the same as the one that 
<A NAME="50"></A>precedes it, with, however, a different turn of expression. For we desire 
<A NAME="51"></A>justice in our friends for itself, even though it will make no difference 
<A NAME="52"></A>to us, and even though they be in India; whereas in our enemies we desire 
<A NAME="53"></A>it for something else, in order that they may do us no 
<A NAME="54"></A>harm.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>Also, that which is in itself the cause of good is more desirable 
<A NAME="56"></A>than what is so per accidens, e.g. virtue than luck (for the former in 
<A NAME="57"></A>itself, and the latter per accidens, the cause of good things), and so 
<A NAME="58"></A>in other cases of the same kind. Likewise also in the case of the contrary; 
<A NAME="59"></A>for what is in itself the cause of evil is more objectionable than what 
<A NAME="60"></A>is so per accidens, e.g. vice and chance: for the one is bad in itself, 
<A NAME="61"></A>whereas chance is so per accidens.
<A NAME="62"></A><BR><BR>Also, what is good absolutely is more desirable than what is good 
<A NAME="63"></A>for a particular person, e.g. recovery of health than a surgical operation; 
<A NAME="64"></A>for the former is good absolutely, the latter only for a particular person, 
<A NAME="65"></A>viz. the man who needs an operation. So too what is good by nature is more 
<A NAME="66"></A>desirable than the good that is not so by nature, e.g. justice than the 
<A NAME="67"></A>just man; for the one is good by nature, whereas in the other case the 
<A NAME="68"></A>goodness is acquired. Also the attribute is more desirable which belongs 
<A NAME="69"></A>to the better and more honourable subject, e.g. to a god rather than to 
<A NAME="70"></A>a man, and to the soul rather than to the body. So too the property of 
<A NAME="71"></A>the better thing is better than the property of the worse; e.g. the property 
<A NAME="72"></A>of God than the property of man: for whereas in respect of what is common 
<A NAME="73"></A>in both of them they do not differ at all from each other, in respect of 
<A NAME="74"></A>their properties the one surpasses the other. Also that is better which 
<A NAME="75"></A>is inherent in things better or prior or more honourable: thus (e.g.) health 
<A NAME="76"></A>is better than strength and beauty: for the former is inherent in the moist 
<A NAME="77"></A>and the dry, and the hot and the cold, in fact in all the primary constituents 
<A NAME="78"></A>of an animal, whereas the others are inherent in what is secondary, strength 
<A NAME="79"></A>being a feature of the sinews and bones, while beauty is generally supposed 
<A NAME="80"></A>to consist in a certain symmetry of the limbs. Also the end is generally 
<A NAME="81"></A>supposed to be more desirable than the means, and of two means, that which 
<A NAME="82"></A>lies nearer the end. In general, too, a means directed towards the end 
<A NAME="83"></A>of life is more desirable than a means to anything else, e.g. that which 
<A NAME="84"></A>contributes to happiness than that which contributes to prudence. Also 
<A NAME="85"></A>the competent is more desirable than the incompetent. Moreover, of two 
<A NAME="86"></A>productive agents that one is more desirable whose end is better; while 
<A NAME="87"></A>between a productive agent and an end we can decide by a proportional sum 
<A NAME="88"></A>whenever the excess of the one end over the other is greater than that 
<A NAME="89"></A>of the latter over its own productive means: e.g. supposing the excess 
<A NAME="90"></A>of happiness over health to be greater than that of health over what produces 
<A NAME="91"></A>health, then what produces happiness is better than health. For what produces 
<A NAME="92"></A>happiness exceeds what produces health just as much as happiness exceeds 
<A NAME="93"></A>health. But health exceeds what produces health by a smaller amount; ergo, 
<A NAME="94"></A>the excess of what produces happiness over what produces health is greater 
<A NAME="95"></A>than that of health over what produces health. Clearly, therefore, what 
<A NAME="96"></A>produces happiness is more desirable than health: for it exceeds the same 
<A NAME="97"></A>standard by a greater amount. Moreover, what is in itself nobler and more 
<A NAME="98"></A>precious and praiseworthy is more desirable than what is less so, e.g. 
<A NAME="99"></A>friendship than wealth, and justice than strength. For the former belong 
<A NAME="100"></A>in themselves to the class of things precious and praiseworthy, while the 
<A NAME="101"></A>latter do so not in themselves but for something else: for no one prizes 
<A NAME="102"></A>wealth for itself but always for something else, whereas we prize friendship 
<A NAME="103"></A>for itself, even though nothing else is likely to come to us from 
<A NAME="104"></A>it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="105"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, whenever two things are very much like one another, and 
<A NAME="107"></A>we cannot see any superiority in the one over the other of them, we should 
<A NAME="108"></A>look at them from the standpoint of their consequences. For the one which 
<A NAME="109"></A>is followed by the greater good is the more desirable: or, if the consequences 
<A NAME="110"></A>be evil, that is more desirable which is followed by the less evil. For 
<A NAME="111"></A>though both may be desirable, yet there may possibly be some unpleasant 
<A NAME="112"></A>consequence involved to turn the scale. Our survey from the point of view 
<A NAME="113"></A>of consequences lies in two directions, for there are prior consequences 
<A NAME="114"></A>and later consequences: e.g. if a man learns, it follows that he was ignorant 
<A NAME="115"></A>before and knows afterwards. As a rule, the later consequence is the better 
<A NAME="116"></A>to consider. You should take, therefore, whichever of the consequences 
<A NAME="117"></A>suits your purpose.
<A NAME="118"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, a greater number of good things is more desirable than 
<A NAME="119"></A>a smaller, either absolutely or when the one is included in the other, 
<A NAME="120"></A>viz. the smaller number in the greater. An objection may be raised suppose 
<A NAME="121"></A>in some particular case the one is valued for the sake of the other; for 
<A NAME="122"></A>then the two together are not more desirable than the one; e.g. recovery 
<A NAME="123"></A>of health and health, than health alone, inasmuch as we desire recovery 
<A NAME="124"></A>of health for the sake of health. Also it is quite possible for what is 
<A NAME="125"></A>not good, together with what is, to be more desirable than a greater number 
<A NAME="126"></A>of good things, e.g. the combination of happiness and something else which 
<A NAME="127"></A>is not good may be more desirable than the combination of justice and courage. 
<A NAME="128"></A>Also, the same things are more valuable if accompanied than if unaccompanied 
<A NAME="129"></A>by pleasure, and likewise when free from pain than when attended with 
<A NAME="130"></A>pain.
<A NAME="131"></A><BR><BR>Also, everything is more desirable at the season when it is of 
<A NAME="132"></A>greater consequence; e.g. freedom from pain in old age more than in youth: 
<A NAME="133"></A>for it is of greater consequence in old age. On the same principle also, 
<A NAME="134"></A>prudence is more desirable in old age; for no man chooses the young to 
<A NAME="135"></A>guide him, because he does not expect them to be prudent. With courage, 
<A NAME="136"></A>the converse is the case, for it is in youth that the active exercise of 
<A NAME="137"></A>courage is more imperatively required. Likewise also with temperance; for 
<A NAME="138"></A>the young are more troubled by their passions than are their 
<A NAME="139"></A>elders.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>Also, that is more desirable which is more useful at every season 
<A NAME="141"></A>or at most seasons, e.g. justice and temperance rather than courage: for 
<A NAME="142"></A>they are always useful, while courage is only useful at times. Also, that 
<A NAME="143"></A>one of two things which if all possess, we do not need the other thing, 
<A NAME="144"></A>is more desirable than that which all may possess and still we want the 
<A NAME="145"></A>other one as well. Take the case of justice and courage; if everybody were 
<A NAME="146"></A>just, there would be no use for courage, whereas all might be courageous, 
<A NAME="147"></A>and still justice would be of use.
<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, judge by the destructions and losses and generations 
<A NAME="149"></A>and acquisitions and contraries of things: for things whose destruction 
<A NAME="150"></A>is more objectionable are themselves more desirable. Likewise also with 
<A NAME="151"></A>the losses and contraries of things; for a thing whose loss or whose contrary 
<A NAME="152"></A>is more objectionable is itself more desirable. With the generations or 
<A NAME="153"></A>acquisitions of things the opposite is the case: for things whose acquisition 
<A NAME="154"></A>or generation is more desirable are themselves also desirable. Another 
<A NAME="155"></A>commonplace rule is that what is nearer to the good is better and more 
<A NAME="156"></A>desirable, i.e. what more nearly resembles the good: thus justice is better 
<A NAME="157"></A>than a just man. Also, that which is more like than another thing to something 
<A NAME="158"></A>better than itself, as e.g. some say that Ajax was a better man than Odysseus 
<A NAME="159"></A>because he was more like Achilles. An objection may be raised to this that 
<A NAME="160"></A>it is not true: for it is quite possible that Ajax did not resemble Achilles 
<A NAME="161"></A>more nearly than Odysseus in the points which made Achilles the best of 
<A NAME="162"></A>them, and that Odysseus was a good man, though unlike Achilles. Look also 
<A NAME="163"></A>to see whether the resemblance be that of a caricature, like the resemblance 
<A NAME="164"></A>of a monkey to a man, whereas a horse bears none: for the monkey is not 
<A NAME="165"></A>the more handsome creature, despite its nearer resemblance to a man. Again, 
<A NAME="166"></A>in the case of two things, if one is more like the better thing while another 
<A NAME="167"></A>is more like the worse, then that is likely to be better which is more 
<A NAME="168"></A>like the better. This too, however, admits of an objection: for quite possibly 
<A NAME="169"></A>the one only slightly resembles the better, while the other strongly resembles 
<A NAME="170"></A>the worse, e.g. supposing the resemblance of Ajax to Achilles to be slight, 
<A NAME="171"></A>while that of Odysseus to Nestor is strong. Also it may be that the one 
<A NAME="172"></A>which is like the better type shows a degrading likeness, whereas the one 
<A NAME="173"></A>which is like the worse type improves upon it: witness the likeness of 
<A NAME="174"></A>a horse to a donkey, and that of a monkey to a man.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>Another rule is that the more conspicuous good is more desirable 
<A NAME="176"></A>than the less conspicuous, and the more difficult than the easier: for 
<A NAME="177"></A>we appreciate better the possession of things that cannot be easily acquired. 
<A NAME="178"></A>Also the more personal possession is more desirable than the more widely 
<A NAME="179"></A>shared. Also, that which is more free from connexion with evil: for what 
<A NAME="180"></A>is not attended by any unpleasantness is more desirable than what is so 
<A NAME="181"></A>attended.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, if A be without qualification better than B, then also 
<A NAME="183"></A>the best of the members of A is better than the best of the members of 
<A NAME="184"></A>B; e.g. if Man be better than Horse, then also the best man is better than 
<A NAME="185"></A>the best horse. Also, if the best in A be better than the best in B, then 
<A NAME="186"></A>also A is better than B without qualification; e.g. if the best man be 
<A NAME="187"></A>better than the best horse, then also Man is better than Horse without 
<A NAME="188"></A>qualification.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, things which our friends can share are more desirable 
<A NAME="190"></A>than those they cannot. Also, things which we like rather to do to our 
<A NAME="191"></A>friend are more desirable than those we like to do to the man in the street, 
<A NAME="192"></A>e.g. just dealing and the doing of good rather than the semblance of them: 
<A NAME="193"></A>for we would rather really do good to our friends than seem to do so, whereas 
<A NAME="194"></A>towards the man in the street the converse is the case.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>Also, superfluities are better than necessities, and are sometimes 
<A NAME="196"></A>more desirable as well: for the good life is better than mere life, and 
<A NAME="197"></A>good life is a superfluity, whereas mere life itself is a necessity. Sometimes, 
<A NAME="198"></A>though, what is better is not also more desirable: for there is no necessity 
<A NAME="199"></A>that because it is better it should also be more desirable: at least to 
<A NAME="200"></A>be a philosopher is better than to make money, but it is not more desirable 
<A NAME="201"></A>for a man who lacks the necessities of life. The expression 'superfluity' 
<A NAME="202"></A>applies whenever a man possesses the necessities of life and sets to work 
<A NAME="203"></A>to secure as well other noble acquisitions. Roughly speaking, perhaps, 
<A NAME="204"></A>necessities are more desirable, while superfluities are 
<A NAME="205"></A>better.
<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>Also, what cannot be got from another is more desirable than what 
<A NAME="207"></A>can be got from another as well, as (e.g.) is the case of justice compared 
<A NAME="208"></A>with courage. Also, A is more desirable if A is desirable without B, but 
<A NAME="209"></A>not B without A: power (e.g.) is not desirable without prudence, but prudence 
<A NAME="210"></A>is desirable without power. Also, if of two things we repudiate the one 
<A NAME="211"></A>in order to be thought to possess the other, then that one is more desirable 
<A NAME="212"></A>which we wish to be thought to possess; thus (e.g.) we repudiate the love 
<A NAME="213"></A>of hard work in order that people may think us geniuses.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, that is more desirable in whose absence it is less blameworthy 
<A NAME="215"></A>for people to be vexed; and that is more desirable in whose absence it 
<A NAME="216"></A>is more blameworthy for a man not to be vexed.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="217"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, of things that belong to the same species one which possesses 
<A NAME="219"></A>the peculiar virtue of the species is more desirable than one which does 
<A NAME="220"></A>not. If both possess it, then the one which possesses it in a greater degree 
<A NAME="221"></A>is more desirable.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, if one thing makes good whatever it touches, while another 
<A NAME="223"></A>does not, the former is more desirable, just as also what makes things 
<A NAME="224"></A>warm is warmer than what does not. If both do so, then that one is more 
<A NAME="225"></A>desirable which does so in a greater degree, or if it render good the better 
<A NAME="226"></A>and more important object-if (e.g.), the one makes good the soul, and the 
<A NAME="227"></A>other the body.
<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, judge things by their inflexions and uses and actions 
<A NAME="229"></A>and works, and judge these by them: for they go with each other: e.g. if 
<A NAME="230"></A>'justly' means something more desirable than 'courageously', then also 
<A NAME="231"></A>justice means something more desirable than courage; and if justice be 
<A NAME="232"></A>more desirable than courage, then also 'justly' means something more desirable 
<A NAME="233"></A>than 'courageously'. Similarly also in the other cases.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, if one thing exceeds while the other falls short of the 
<A NAME="235"></A>same standard of good, the one which exceeds is the more desirable; or 
<A NAME="236"></A>if the one exceeds an even higher standard. Nay more, if there be two things 
<A NAME="237"></A>both preferable to something, the one which is more highly preferable to 
<A NAME="238"></A>it is more desirable than the less highly preferable. Moreover, when the 
<A NAME="239"></A>excess of a thing is more desirable than the excess of something else, 
<A NAME="240"></A>that thing is itself also more desirable than the other, as (e.g.) friendship 
<A NAME="241"></A>than money: for an excess of friendship is more desirable than an excess 
<A NAME="242"></A>of money. So also that of which a man would rather that it were his by 
<A NAME="243"></A>his own doing is more desirable than what he would rather get by another's 
<A NAME="244"></A>doing, e.g. friends than money. Moreover, judge by means of an addition, 
<A NAME="245"></A>and see if the addition of A to the same thing as B makes the whole more 
<A NAME="246"></A>desirable than does the addition of B. You must, however, beware of adducing 
<A NAME="247"></A>a case in which the common term uses, or in some other way helps the case 
<A NAME="248"></A>of, one of the things added to it, but not the other, as (e.g.) if you 
<A NAME="249"></A>took a saw and a sickle in combination with the art of carpentry: for in 
<A NAME="250"></A>the combination the saw is a more desirable thing, but it is not a more 
<A NAME="251"></A>desirable thing without qualification. Again, a thing is more desirable 
<A NAME="252"></A>if, when added to a lesser good, it makes the whole greater good. Likewise, 
<A NAME="253"></A>also, you should judge by means of subtraction: for the thing upon whose 
<A NAME="254"></A>subtraction the remainder is a lesser good may be taken to be a greater 
<A NAME="255"></A>good, whichever it be whose subtraction makes the remainder a lesser 
<A NAME="256"></A>good.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>Also, if one thing be desirable for itself, and the other for the 
<A NAME="258"></A>look of it, the former is more desirable, as (e.g.) health than beauty. 
<A NAME="259"></A>A thing is defined as being desired for the look of it if, supposing no 
<A NAME="260"></A>one knew of it, you would not care to have it. Also, it is more desirable 
<A NAME="261"></A>both for itself and for the look of it, while the other thing is desirable 
<A NAME="262"></A>on the one ground alone. Also, whichever is the more precious for itself, 
<A NAME="263"></A>is also better and more desirable. A thing may be taken to be more precious 
<A NAME="264"></A>in itself which we choose rather for itself, without anything else being 
<A NAME="265"></A>likely to come of it.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, you should distinguish in how many senses 'desirable' 
<A NAME="267"></A>is used, and with a view to what ends, e.g. expediency or honour or pleasure. 
<A NAME="268"></A>For what is useful for all or most of them may be taken to be more desirable 
<A NAME="269"></A>than what is not useful in like manner. If the same characters belong to 
<A NAME="270"></A>both things you should look and see which possesses them more markedly, 
<A NAME="271"></A>i.e. which of the two is the more pleasant or more honourable or more expedient. 
<A NAME="272"></A>Again, that is more desirable which serves the better purpose, e.g. that 
<A NAME="273"></A>which serves to promote virtue more than that which serves to promote pleasure. 
<A NAME="274"></A>Likewise also in the case of objectionable things; for that is more objectionable 
<A NAME="275"></A>which stands more in the way of what is desirable, e.g. disease more than 
<A NAME="276"></A>ugliness: for disease is a greater hindrance both to pleasure and to being 
<A NAME="277"></A>good.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, argue by showing that the thing in question is in like 
<A NAME="279"></A>measure objectionable and desirable: for a thing of such a character that 
<A NAME="280"></A>a man might well desire and object to it alike is less desirable than the 
<A NAME="281"></A>other which is desirable only.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="282"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>Comparisons of things together should therefore be conducted in 
<A NAME="284"></A>the manner prescribed. The same commonplace rules are useful also for showing 
<A NAME="285"></A>that anything is simply desirable or objectionable: for we have only to 
<A NAME="286"></A>subtract the excess of one thing over another. For if what is more precious 
<A NAME="287"></A>be more desirable, then also what is precious is desirable; and if what 
<A NAME="288"></A>is more useful be more desirable, then also what is useful is desirable. 
<A NAME="289"></A>Likewise, also, in the case of other things which admit of comparisons 
<A NAME="290"></A>of that kind. For in some cases in the very course of comparing the things 
<A NAME="291"></A>together we at once assert also that each of them, or the one of them, 
<A NAME="292"></A>is desirable, e.g. whenever we call the one good 'by nature' and the other 
<A NAME="293"></A>'not by nature': for dearly what is good by nature is 
<A NAME="294"></A>desirable.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="295"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>The commonplace rules relating to comparative degrees and amounts 
<A NAME="297"></A>ought to be taken in the most general possible form: for when so taken 
<A NAME="298"></A>they are likely to be useful in a larger number of instances. It is possible 
<A NAME="299"></A>to render some of the actual rules given above more universal by a slight 
<A NAME="300"></A>alteration of the expression, e.g. that what by nature exhibits such and 
<A NAME="301"></A>such a quality exhibits that quality in a greater degree than what exhibits 
<A NAME="302"></A>it not by nature. Also, if one thing does, and another does not, impart 
<A NAME="303"></A>such and such a quality to that which possesses it, or to which it belongs, 
<A NAME="304"></A>then whichever does impart it is of that quality in greater degree than 
<A NAME="305"></A>the one which does not impart it; and if both impart it, then that one 
<A NAME="306"></A>exhibits it in a greater degree which imparts it in a greater 
<A NAME="307"></A>degree.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, if in any character one thing exceeds and another falls 
<A NAME="309"></A>short of the same standard; also, if the one exceeds something which exceeds 
<A NAME="310"></A>a given standard, while the other does not reach that standard, then clearly 
<A NAME="311"></A>the first-named thing exhibits that character in a greater degree. Moreover, 
<A NAME="312"></A>you should judge by means of addition, and see if A when added to the same 
<A NAME="313"></A>thing as B imparts to the whole such and such a character in a more marked 
<A NAME="314"></A>degree than B, or if, when added to a thing which exhibits that character 
<A NAME="315"></A>in a less degree, it imparts that character to the whole in a greater degree. 
<A NAME="316"></A>Likewise, also, you may judge by means of subtraction: for a thing upon 
<A NAME="317"></A>whose subtraction the remainder exhibits such and such a character in a 
<A NAME="318"></A>less degree, itself exhibits that character in a greater degree. Also, 
<A NAME="319"></A>things exhibit such and such a character in a greater degree if more free 
<A NAME="320"></A>from admixture with their contraries; e.g. that is whiter which is more 
<A NAME="321"></A>free from admixture with black. Moreover, apart from the rules given above, 
<A NAME="322"></A>that has such and such a character in greater degree which admits in a 
<A NAME="323"></A>greater degree of the definition proper to the given character; e.g. if 
<A NAME="324"></A>the definition of 'white' be 'a colour which pierces the vision', then 
<A NAME="325"></A>that is whiter which is in a greater degree a colour that pierces the 
<A NAME="326"></A>vision.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="327"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="328"></A><BR><BR>If the question be put in a particular and not in a universal form, 
<A NAME="329"></A>in the first place the universal constructive or destructive commonplace 
<A NAME="330"></A>rules that have been given may all be brought into use. For in demolishing 
<A NAME="331"></A>or establishing a thing universally we also show it in particular: for 
<A NAME="332"></A>if it be true of all, it is true also of some, and if untrue of all, it 
<A NAME="333"></A>is untrue of some. Especially handy and of general application are the 
<A NAME="334"></A>commonplace rules that are drawn from the opposites and co-ordinates and 
<A NAME="335"></A>inflexions of a thing: for public opinion grants alike the claim that if 
<A NAME="336"></A>all pleasure be good, then also all pain is evil, and the claim that if 
<A NAME="337"></A>some pleasure be good, then also some pain is evil. Moreover, if some form 
<A NAME="338"></A>of sensation be not a capacity, then also some form of failure of sensation 
<A NAME="339"></A>is not a failure of capacity. Also, if the object of conception is in some 
<A NAME="340"></A>cases an object of knowledge, then also some form of conceiving is knowledge. 
<A NAME="341"></A>Again, if what is unjust be in some cases good, then also what is just 
<A NAME="342"></A>is in some cases evil; and if what happens justly is in some cases evil, 
<A NAME="343"></A>then also what happens unjustly is in some cases good. Also, if what is 
<A NAME="344"></A>pleasant is in some cases objectionable, then pleasure is in some cases 
<A NAME="345"></A>an objectionable thing. On the same principle, also, if what is pleasant 
<A NAME="346"></A>is in some cases beneficial, then pleasure is in some cases a beneficial 
<A NAME="347"></A>thing. The case is the same also as regards the things that destroy, and 
<A NAME="348"></A>the processes of generation and destruction. For if anything that destroys 
<A NAME="349"></A>pleasure or knowledge be in some cases good, then we may take it that pleasure 
<A NAME="350"></A>or knowledge is in some cases an evil thing. Likewise, also, if the destruction 
<A NAME="351"></A>of knowledge be in some cases a good thing or its production an evil thing, 
<A NAME="352"></A>then knowledge will be in some cases an evil thing; e.g. if for a man to 
<A NAME="353"></A>forget his disgraceful conduct be a good thing, and to remember it be an 
<A NAME="354"></A>evil thing, then the knowledge of his disgraceful conduct may be taken 
<A NAME="355"></A>to be an evil thing. The same holds also in other cases: in all such cases 
<A NAME="356"></A>the premiss and the conclusion are equally likely to be 
<A NAME="357"></A>accepted.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>Moreover you should judge by means of greater or smaller or like 
<A NAME="359"></A>degrees: for if some member of another genus exhibit such and such a character 
<A NAME="360"></A>in a more marked degree than your object, while no member of that genus 
<A NAME="361"></A>exhibits that character at all, then you may take it that neither does 
<A NAME="362"></A>the object in question exhibit it; e.g. if some form of knowledge be good 
<A NAME="363"></A>in a greater degree than pleasure, while no form of knowledge is good, 
<A NAME="364"></A>then you may take it that pleasure is not good either. Also, you should 
<A NAME="365"></A>judge by a smaller or like degree in the same way: for so you will find 
<A NAME="366"></A>it possible both to demolish and to establish a view, except that whereas 
<A NAME="367"></A>both are possible by means of like degrees, by means of a smaller degree 
<A NAME="368"></A>it is possible only to establish, not to overthrow. For if a certain form 
<A NAME="369"></A>of capacity be good in a like degree to knowledge, and a certain form of 
<A NAME="370"></A>capacity be good, then so also is knowledge; while if no form of capacity 
<A NAME="371"></A>be good, then neither is knowledge. If, too, a certain form of capacity 
<A NAME="372"></A>be good in a less degree than knowledge, and a certain form of capacity 
<A NAME="373"></A>be good, then so also is knowledge; but if no form of capacity be good, 
<A NAME="374"></A>there is no necessity that no form of knowledge either should be good. 
<A NAME="375"></A>Clearly, then, it is only possible to establish a view by means of a less 
<A NAME="376"></A>degree.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>Not only by means of another genus can you overthrow a view, but 
<A NAME="378"></A>also by means of the same, if you take the most marked instance of the 
<A NAME="379"></A>character in question; e.g. if it be maintained that some form of knowledge 
<A NAME="380"></A>is good, then, suppose it to be shown that prudence is not good, neither 
<A NAME="381"></A>will any other kind be good, seeing that not even the kind upon which there 
<A NAME="382"></A>is most general agreement is so. Moreover, you should go to work by means 
<A NAME="383"></A>of an hypothesis; you should claim that the attribute, if it belongs or 
<A NAME="384"></A>does not belong in one case, does so in a like degree in all, e.g. that 
<A NAME="385"></A>if the soul of man be immortal, so are other souls as well, while if this 
<A NAME="386"></A>one be not so, neither are the others. If, then, it be maintained that 
<A NAME="387"></A>in some instance the attribute belongs, you must show that in some instance 
<A NAME="388"></A>it does not belong: for then it will follow, by reason of the hypothesis, 
<A NAME="389"></A>that it does not belong to any instance at all. If, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="390"></A>it be maintained that it does not belong in some instance, you must show 
<A NAME="391"></A>that it does belong in some instance, for in this way it will follow that 
<A NAME="392"></A>it belongs to all instances. It is clear that the maker of the hypothesis 
<A NAME="393"></A>universalizes the question, whereas it was stated in a particular form: 
<A NAME="394"></A>for he claims that the maker of a particular admission should make a universal 
<A NAME="395"></A>admission, inasmuch as he claims that if the attribute belongs in one instance, 
<A NAME="396"></A>it belongs also in all instances alike.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>If the problem be indefinite, it is possible to overthrow a statement 
<A NAME="398"></A>in only one way; e.g. if a man has asserted that pleasure is good or is 
<A NAME="399"></A>not good, without any further definition. For if he meant that a particular 
<A NAME="400"></A>pleasure is good, you must show universally that no pleasure is good, if 
<A NAME="401"></A>the proposition in question is to be demolished. And likewise, also, if 
<A NAME="402"></A>he meant that some particular pleasure is not good you must show universally 
<A NAME="403"></A>that all pleasure is good: it is impossible to demolish it in any other 
<A NAME="404"></A>way. For if we show that some particular pleasure is not good or is good, 
<A NAME="405"></A>the proposition in question is not yet demolished. It is clear, then, that 
<A NAME="406"></A>it is possible to demolish an indefinite statement in one way only, whereas 
<A NAME="407"></A>it can be established in two ways: for whether we show universally that 
<A NAME="408"></A>all pleasure is good, or whether we show that a particular pleasure is 
<A NAME="409"></A>good, the proposition in question will have been proved. Likewise, also, 
<A NAME="410"></A>supposing we are required to argue that some particular pleasure is not 
<A NAME="411"></A>good, if we show that no pleasure is good or that a particular pleasure 
<A NAME="412"></A>is not good, we shall have produced an argument in both ways, both universally 
<A NAME="413"></A>and in particular, to show that some particular pleasure is not good. If, 
<A NAME="414"></A>on the other hand, the statement made be definite, it will be possible 
<A NAME="415"></A>to demolish it in two ways; e.g. if it be maintained that it is an attribute 
<A NAME="416"></A>of some particular pleasure to be good, while of some it is not: for whether 
<A NAME="417"></A>it be shown that all pleasure, or that no pleasure, is good, the proposition 
<A NAME="418"></A>in question will have been demolished. If, however, he has stated that 
<A NAME="419"></A>only one single pleasure is good, it is possible to demolish it in three 
<A NAME="420"></A>ways: for by showing that all pleasure, or that no pleasure, or that more 
<A NAME="421"></A>than one pleasure, is good, we shall have demolished the statement in question. 
<A NAME="422"></A>If the statement be made still more definite, e.g. that prudence alone 
<A NAME="423"></A>of the virtues is knowledge, there are four ways of demolishing it: for 
<A NAME="424"></A>if it be shown that all virtue is knowledge, or that no virtue is so, or 
<A NAME="425"></A>that some other virtue (e.g. justice) is so, or that prudence itself is 
<A NAME="426"></A>not knowledge, the proposition in question will have been 
<A NAME="427"></A>demolished.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>It is useful also to take a look at individual instances, in cases 
<A NAME="429"></A>where some attribute has been said to belong or not to belong, as in the 
<A NAME="430"></A>case of universal questions. Moreover, you should take a glance among genera, 
<A NAME="431"></A>dividing them by their species until you come to those that are not further 
<A NAME="432"></A>divisible, as has been said before:' for whether the attribute is found 
<A NAME="433"></A>to belong in all cases or in none, you should, after adducing several instances, 
<A NAME="434"></A>claim that he should either admit your point universally, or else bring 
<A NAME="435"></A>an objection showing in what case it does not hold. Moreover, in cases 
<A NAME="436"></A>where it is possible to make the accident definite either specifically 
<A NAME="437"></A>or numerically, you should look and see whether perhaps none of them belongs, 
<A NAME="438"></A>showing e.g. that time is not moved, nor yet a movement, by enumerating 
<A NAME="439"></A>how many species there are of movement: for if none of these belong to 
<A NAME="440"></A>time, clearly it does not move, nor yet is a movement. Likewise, also, 
<A NAME="441"></A>you can show that the soul is not a number, by dividing all numbers into 
<A NAME="442"></A>either odd or even: for then, if the soul be neither odd nor even, clearly 
<A NAME="443"></A>it is not a number.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>In regard then to Accident, you should set to work by means like 
<A NAME="445"></A>these, and in this manner.
