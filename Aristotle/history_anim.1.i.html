<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Of the parts of animals some are simple: to wit, all such as divide into 
<A NAME="12"></A>parts uniform with themselves, as flesh into flesh; others are composite, 
<A NAME="13"></A>such as divide into parts not uniform with themselves, as, for instance, 
<A NAME="14"></A>the hand does not divide into hands nor the face into 
<A NAME="15"></A>faces.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>And of such as these, some are called not parts merely, but limbs 
<A NAME="17"></A>or members. Such are those parts that, while entire in themselves, have 
<A NAME="18"></A>within themselves other diverse parts: as for instance, the head, foot, 
<A NAME="19"></A>hand, the arm as a whole, the chest; for these are all in themselves entire 
<A NAME="20"></A>parts, and there are other diverse parts belonging to 
<A NAME="21"></A>them.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>All those parts that do not subdivide into parts uniform with themselves 
<A NAME="23"></A>are composed of parts that do so subdivide, for instance, hand is composed 
<A NAME="24"></A>of flesh, sinews, and bones. Of animals, some resemble one another in all 
<A NAME="25"></A>their parts, while others have parts wherein they differ. Sometimes the 
<A NAME="26"></A>parts are identical in form or species, as, for instance, one man's nose 
<A NAME="27"></A>or eye resembles another man's nose or eye, flesh flesh, and bone bone; 
<A NAME="28"></A>and in like manner with a horse, and with all other animals which we reckon 
<A NAME="29"></A>to be of one and the same species: for as the whole is to the whole, so 
<A NAME="30"></A>each to each are the parts severally. In other cases the parts are identical, 
<A NAME="31"></A>save only for a difference in the way of excess or defect, as is the case 
<A NAME="32"></A>in such animals as are of one and the same genus. By 'genus' I mean, for 
<A NAME="33"></A>instance, Bird or Fish, for each of these is subject to difference in respect 
<A NAME="34"></A>of its genus, and there are many species of fishes and of 
<A NAME="35"></A>birds.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>Within the limits of genera, most of the parts as a rule exhibit 
<A NAME="37"></A>differences through contrast of the property or accident, such as colour 
<A NAME="38"></A>and shape, to which they are subject: in that some are more and some in 
<A NAME="39"></A>a less degree the subject of the same property or accident; and also in 
<A NAME="40"></A>the way of multitude or fewness, magnitude or parvitude, in short in the 
<A NAME="41"></A>way of excess or defect. Thus in some the texture of the flesh is soft, 
<A NAME="42"></A>in others firm; some have a long bill, others a short one; some have abundance 
<A NAME="43"></A>of feathers, others have only a small quantity. It happens further that 
<A NAME="44"></A>some have parts that others have not: for instance, some have spurs and 
<A NAME="45"></A>others not, some have crests and others not; but as a general rule, most 
<A NAME="46"></A>parts and those that go to make up the bulk of the body are either identical 
<A NAME="47"></A>with one another, or differ from one another in the way of contrast and 
<A NAME="48"></A>of excess and defect. For 'the more' and 'the less' may be represented 
<A NAME="49"></A>as 'excess' or 'defect'.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>Once again, we may have to do with animals whose parts are neither 
<A NAME="51"></A>identical in form nor yet identical save for differences in the way of 
<A NAME="52"></A>excess or defect: but they are the same only in the way of analogy, as, 
<A NAME="53"></A>for instance, bone is only analogous to fish-bone, nail to hoof, hand to 
<A NAME="54"></A>claw, and scale to feather; for what the feather is in a bird, the scale 
<A NAME="55"></A>is in a fish.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>The parts, then, which animals severally possess are diverse from, 
<A NAME="57"></A>or identical with, one another in the fashion above described. And they 
<A NAME="58"></A>are so furthermore in the way of local disposition: for many animals have 
<A NAME="59"></A>identical organs that differ in position; for instance, some have teats 
<A NAME="60"></A>in the breast, others close to the thighs.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>Of the substances that are composed of parts uniform (or homogeneous) 
<A NAME="62"></A>with themselves, some are soft and moist, others are dry and solid. The 
<A NAME="63"></A>soft and moist are such either absolutely or so long as they are in their 
<A NAME="64"></A>natural conditions, as, for instance, blood, serum, lard, suet, marrow, 
<A NAME="65"></A>sperm, gall, milk in such as have it flesh and the like; and also, in a 
<A NAME="66"></A>different way, the superfluities, as phlegm and the excretions of the belly 
<A NAME="67"></A>and the bladder. The dry and solid are such as sinew, skin, vein, hair, 
<A NAME="68"></A>bone, gristle, nail, horn (a term which as applied to the part involves 
<A NAME="69"></A>an ambiguity, since the whole also by virtue of its form is designated 
<A NAME="70"></A>horn), and such parts as present an analogy to these.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Animals differ from one another in their modes of subsistence, 
<A NAME="72"></A>in their actions, in their habits, and in their parts. Concerning these 
<A NAME="73"></A>differences we shall first speak in broad and general terms, and subsequently 
<A NAME="74"></A>we shall treat of the same with close reference to each particular 
<A NAME="75"></A>genus.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>Differences are manifested in modes of subsistence, in habits, 
<A NAME="77"></A>in actions performed. For instance, some animals live in water and others 
<A NAME="78"></A>on land. And of those that live in water some do so in one way, and some 
<A NAME="79"></A>in another: that is to say, some live and feed in the water, take in and 
<A NAME="80"></A>emit water, and cannot live if deprived of water, as is the case with the 
<A NAME="81"></A>great majority of fishes; others get their food and spend their days in 
<A NAME="82"></A>the water, but do not take in water but air, nor do they bring forth in 
<A NAME="83"></A>the water. Many of these creatures are furnished with feet, as the otter, 
<A NAME="84"></A>the beaver, and the crocodile; some are furnished with wings, as the diver 
<A NAME="85"></A>and the grebe; some are destitute of feet, as the water-snake. Some creatures 
<A NAME="86"></A>get their living in the water and cannot exist outside it: but for all 
<A NAME="87"></A>that do not take in either air or water, as, for instance, the sea-nettle 
<A NAME="88"></A>and the oyster. And of creatures that live in the water some live in the 
<A NAME="89"></A>sea, some in rivers, some in lakes, and some in marshes, as the frog and 
<A NAME="90"></A>the newt.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>Of animals that live on dry land some take in air and emit it, 
<A NAME="92"></A>which phenomena are termed 'inhalation' and 'exhalation'; as, for instance, 
<A NAME="93"></A>man and all such land animals as are furnished with lungs. Others, again, 
<A NAME="94"></A>do not inhale air, yet live and find their sustenance on dry land; as, 
<A NAME="95"></A>for instance, the wasp, the bee, and all other insects. And by 'insects' 
<A NAME="96"></A>I mean such creatures as have nicks or notches on their bodies, either 
<A NAME="97"></A>on their bellies or on both backs and bellies.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>And of land animals many, as has been said, derive their subsistence 
<A NAME="99"></A>from the water; but of creatures that live in and inhale water not a single 
<A NAME="100"></A>one derives its subsistence from dry land.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>Some animals at first live in water, and by and by change their 
<A NAME="102"></A>shape and live out of water, as is the case with river worms, for out of 
<A NAME="103"></A>these the gadfly develops.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore, some animals are stationary, and some are erratic. 
<A NAME="105"></A>Stationary animals are found in water, but no such creature is found on 
<A NAME="106"></A>dry land. In the water are many creatures that live in close adhesion to 
<A NAME="107"></A>an external object, as is the case with several kinds of oyster. And, by 
<A NAME="108"></A>the way, the sponge appears to be endowed with a certain sensibility: as 
<A NAME="109"></A>a proof of which it is alleged that the difficulty in detaching it from 
<A NAME="110"></A>its moorings is increased if the movement to detach it be not covertly 
<A NAME="111"></A>applied.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>Other creatures adhere at one time to an object and detach themselves 
<A NAME="113"></A>from it at other times, as is the case with a species of the so-called 
<A NAME="114"></A>sea-nettle; for some of these creatures seek their food in the night-time 
<A NAME="115"></A>loose and unattached.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>Many creatures are unattached but motionless, as is the case with 
<A NAME="117"></A>oysters and the so-called holothuria. Some can swim, as, for instance, 
<A NAME="118"></A>fishes, molluscs, and crustaceans, such as the crawfish. But some of these 
<A NAME="119"></A>last move by walking, as the crab, for it is the nature of the creature, 
<A NAME="120"></A>though it lives in water, to move by walking.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Of land animals some are furnished with wings, such as birds and 
<A NAME="122"></A>bees, and these are so furnished in different ways one from another; others 
<A NAME="123"></A>are furnished with feet. Of the animals that are furnished with feet some 
<A NAME="124"></A>walk, some creep, and some wriggle. But no creature is able only to move 
<A NAME="125"></A>by flying, as the fish is able only to swim, for the animals with leathern 
<A NAME="126"></A>wings can walk; the bat has feet and the seal has imperfect 
<A NAME="127"></A>feet.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>Some birds have feet of little power, and are therefore called 
<A NAME="129"></A>Apodes. This little bird is powerful on the wing; and, as a rule, birds 
<A NAME="130"></A>that resemble it are weak-footed and strong winged, such as the swallow 
<A NAME="131"></A>and the drepanis or (?) Alpine swift; for all these birds resemble one 
<A NAME="132"></A>another in their habits and in their plumage, and may easily be mistaken 
<A NAME="133"></A>one for another. (The apus is to be seen at all seasons, but the drepanis 
<A NAME="134"></A>only after rainy weather in summer; for this is the time when it is seen 
<A NAME="135"></A>and captured, though, as a general rule, it is a rare 
<A NAME="136"></A>bird.)
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>Again, some animals move by walking on the ground as well as by 
<A NAME="138"></A>swimming in water.
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore, the following differences are manifest in their modes 
<A NAME="140"></A>of living and in their actions. Some are gregarious, some are solitary, 
<A NAME="141"></A>whether they be furnished with feet or wings or be fitted for a life in 
<A NAME="142"></A>the water; and some partake of both characters, the solitary and the gregarious. 
<A NAME="143"></A>And of the gregarious, some are disposed to combine for social purposes, 
<A NAME="144"></A>others to live each for its own self.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>Gregarious creatures are, among birds, such as the pigeon, the 
<A NAME="146"></A>crane, and the swan; and, by the way, no bird furnished with crooked talons 
<A NAME="147"></A>is gregarious. Of creatures that live in water many kinds of fishes are 
<A NAME="148"></A>gregarious, such as the so-called migrants, the tunny, the pelamys, and 
<A NAME="149"></A>the bonito.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>Man, by the way, presents a mixture of the two characters, the 
<A NAME="151"></A>gregarious and the solitary.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>Social creatures are such as have some one common object in view; 
<A NAME="153"></A>and this property is not common to all creatures that are gregarious. Such 
<A NAME="154"></A>social creatures are man, the bee, the wasp, the ant, and the 
<A NAME="155"></A>crane.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>Again, of these social creatures some submit to a ruler, others 
<A NAME="157"></A>are subject to no governance: as, for instance, the crane and the several 
<A NAME="158"></A>sorts of bee submit to a ruler, whereas ants and numerous other creatures 
<A NAME="159"></A>are every one his own master.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>And again, both of gregarious and of solitary animals, some are 
<A NAME="161"></A>attached to a fixed home and others are erratic or nomad.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>Also, some are carnivorous, some graminivorous, some omnivorous: 
<A NAME="163"></A>whilst some feed on a peculiar diet, as for instance the bees and the spiders, 
<A NAME="164"></A>for the bee lives on honey and certain other sweets, and the spider lives 
<A NAME="165"></A>by catching flies; and some creatures live on fish. Again, some creatures 
<A NAME="166"></A>catch their food, others treasure it up; whereas others do not 
<A NAME="167"></A>so.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>Some creatures provide themselves with a dwelling, others go without 
<A NAME="169"></A>one: of the former kind are the mole, the mouse, the ant, the bee; of the 
<A NAME="170"></A>latter kind are many insects and quadrupeds. Further, in respect to locality 
<A NAME="171"></A>of dwelling place, some creatures dwell under ground, as the lizard and 
<A NAME="172"></A>the snake; others live on the surface of the ground, as the horse and the 
<A NAME="173"></A>dog. make to themselves holes, others do not
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>Some are nocturnal, as the owl and the bat; others live in the 
<A NAME="175"></A>daylight.
<A NAME="176"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, some creatures are tame and some are wild: some are at 
<A NAME="177"></A>all times tame, as man and the mule; others are at all times savage, as 
<A NAME="178"></A>the leopard and the wolf; and some creatures can be rapidly tamed, as the 
<A NAME="179"></A>elephant.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>Again, we may regard animals in another light. For, whenever a 
<A NAME="181"></A>race of animals is found domesticated, the same is always to be found in 
<A NAME="182"></A>a wild condition; as we find to be the case with horses, kine, swine, (men), 
<A NAME="183"></A>sheep, goats, and dogs.
<A NAME="184"></A><BR><BR>Further, some animals emit sound while others are mute, and some 
<A NAME="185"></A>are endowed with voice: of these latter some have articulate speech, while 
<A NAME="186"></A>others are inarticulate; some are given to continual chirping and twittering 
<A NAME="187"></A>some are prone to silence; some are musical, and some unmusical; but all 
<A NAME="188"></A>animals without exception exercise their power of singing or chattering 
<A NAME="189"></A>chiefly in connexion with the intercourse of the sexes.
<A NAME="190"></A><BR><BR>Again, some creatures live in the fields, as the cushat; some on 
<A NAME="191"></A>the mountains, as the hoopoe; some frequent the abodes of men, as the 
<A NAME="192"></A>pigeon.
<A NAME="193"></A><BR><BR>Some, again, are peculiarly salacious, as the partridge, the barn-door 
<A NAME="194"></A>cock and their congeners; others are inclined to chastity, as the whole 
<A NAME="195"></A>tribe of crows, for birds of this kind indulge but rarely in sexual 
<A NAME="196"></A>intercourse.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>Of marine animals, again, some live in the open seas, some near 
<A NAME="198"></A>the shore, some on rocks.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore, some are combative under offence; others are provident 
<A NAME="200"></A>for defence. Of the former kind are such as act as aggressors upon others 
<A NAME="201"></A>or retaliate when subjected to ill usage, and of the latter kind are such 
<A NAME="202"></A>as merely have some means of guarding themselves against 
<A NAME="203"></A>attack.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>Animals also differ from one another in regard to character in 
<A NAME="205"></A>the following respects. Some are good-tempered, sluggish, and little prone 
<A NAME="206"></A>to ferocity, as the ox; others are quick tempered, ferocious and unteachable, 
<A NAME="207"></A>as the wild boar; some are intelligent and timid, as the stag and the hare; 
<A NAME="208"></A>others are mean and treacherous, as the snake; others are noble and courageous 
<A NAME="209"></A>and high-bred, as the lion; others are thorough-bred and wild and treacherous, 
<A NAME="210"></A>as the wolf: for, by the way, an animal is highbred if it come from a noble 
<A NAME="211"></A>stock, and an animal is thorough-bred if it does not deflect from its racial 
<A NAME="212"></A>characteristics.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>Further, some are crafty and mischievous, as the fox; some are 
<A NAME="214"></A>spirited and affectionate and fawning, as the dog; others are easy-tempered 
<A NAME="215"></A>and easily domesticated, as the elephant; others are cautious and watchful, 
<A NAME="216"></A>as the goose; others are jealous and self-conceited, as the peacock. But 
<A NAME="217"></A>of all animals man alone is capable of deliberation.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>Many animals have memory, and are capable of instruction; but no 
<A NAME="219"></A>other creature except man can recall the past at will.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>With regard to the several genera of animals, particulars as to 
<A NAME="221"></A>their habits of life and modes of existence will be discussed more fully 
<A NAME="222"></A>by and by.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="223"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="224"></A><BR><BR>Common to all animals are the organs whereby they take food and 
<A NAME="225"></A>the organs where into they take it; and these are either identical with 
<A NAME="226"></A>one another, or are diverse in the ways above specified: to wit, either 
<A NAME="227"></A>identical in form, or varying in respect of excess or defect, or resembling 
<A NAME="228"></A>one another analogically, or differing in position.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore, the great majority of animals have other organs besides 
<A NAME="230"></A>these in common, whereby they discharge the residuum of their food: I say, 
<A NAME="231"></A>the great majority, for this statement does not apply to all. And, by the 
<A NAME="232"></A>way, the organ whereby food is taken in is called the mouth, and the organ 
<A NAME="233"></A>whereinto it is taken, the belly; the remainder of the alimentary system 
<A NAME="234"></A>has a great variety of names.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>Now the residuum of food is twofold in kind, wet and dry, and such 
<A NAME="236"></A>creatures as have organs receptive of wet residuum are invariably found 
<A NAME="237"></A>with organs receptive of dry residuum; but such as have organs receptive 
<A NAME="238"></A>of dry residuum need not possess organs receptive of wet residuum. In other 
<A NAME="239"></A>words, an animal has a bowel or intestine if it have a bladder; but an 
<A NAME="240"></A>animal may have a bowel and be without a bladder. And, by the way, I may 
<A NAME="241"></A>here remark that the organ receptive of wet residuum is termed 'bladder', 
<A NAME="242"></A>and the organ receptive of dry residuum 'intestine or 
<A NAME="243"></A>'bowel'.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="244"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>Of animals otherwise, a great many have, besides the organs above-mentioned, 
<A NAME="246"></A>an organ for excretion of the sperm: and of animals capable of generation 
<A NAME="247"></A>one secretes into another, and the other into itself. The latter is termed 
<A NAME="248"></A>'female', and the former 'male'; but some animals have neither male nor 
<A NAME="249"></A>female. Consequently, the organs connected with this function differ in 
<A NAME="250"></A>form, for some animals have a womb and others an organ analogous 
<A NAME="251"></A>thereto.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>The above-mentioned organs, then, are the most indispensable parts 
<A NAME="253"></A>of animals; and with some of them all animals without exception, and with 
<A NAME="254"></A>others animals for the most part, must needs be provided.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>One sense, and one alone, is common to all animals-the sense of 
<A NAME="256"></A>touch. Consequently, there is no special name for the organ in which it 
<A NAME="257"></A>has its seat; for in some groups of animals the organ is identical, in 
<A NAME="258"></A>others it is only analogous.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="259"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>Every animal is supplied with moisture, and, if the animal be deprived 
<A NAME="261"></A>of the same by natural causes or artificial means, death ensues: further, 
<A NAME="262"></A>every animal has another part in which the moisture is contained. These 
<A NAME="263"></A>parts are blood and vein, and in other animals there is something to correspond; 
<A NAME="264"></A>but in these latter the parts are imperfect, being merely fibre and serum 
<A NAME="265"></A>or lymph.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>Touch has its seat in a part uniform and homogeneous, as in the 
<A NAME="267"></A>flesh or something of the kind, and generally, with animals supplied with 
<A NAME="268"></A>blood, in the parts charged with blood. In other animals it has its seat 
<A NAME="269"></A>in parts analogous to the parts charged with blood; but in all cases it 
<A NAME="270"></A>is seated in parts that in their texture are homogeneous.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>The active faculties, on the contrary, are seated in the parts 
<A NAME="272"></A>that are heterogeneous: as, for instance, the business of preparing the 
<A NAME="273"></A>food is seated in the mouth, and the office of locomotion in the feet, 
<A NAME="274"></A>the wings, or in organs to correspond.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>Again, some animals are supplied with blood, as man, the horse, 
<A NAME="276"></A>and all such animals as are, when full-grown, either destitute of feet, 
<A NAME="277"></A>or two-footed, or four-footed; other animals are bloodless, such as the 
<A NAME="278"></A>bee and the wasp, and, of marine animals, the cuttle-fish, the crawfish, 
<A NAME="279"></A>and all such animals as have more than four feet.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="280"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>Again, some animals are viviparous, others oviparous, others vermiparous 
<A NAME="282"></A>or 'grub-bearing'. Some are viviparous, such as man, the horse, the seal, 
<A NAME="283"></A>and all other animals that are hair-coated, and, of marine animals, the 
<A NAME="284"></A>cetaceans, as the dolphin, and the so-called Selachia. (Of these latter 
<A NAME="285"></A>animals, some have a tubular air-passage and no gills, as the dolphin and 
<A NAME="286"></A>the whale: the dolphin with the air-passage going through its back, the 
<A NAME="287"></A>whale with the air-passage in its forehead; others have uncovered gills, 
<A NAME="288"></A>as the Selachia, the sharks and rays.)
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>What we term an egg is a certain completed result of conception 
<A NAME="290"></A>out of which the animal that is to be develops, and in such a way that 
<A NAME="291"></A>in respect to its primitive germ it comes from part only of the egg, while 
<A NAME="292"></A>the rest serves for food as the germ develops. A 'grub' on the other hand 
<A NAME="293"></A>is a thing out of which in its entirety the animal in its entirety develops, 
<A NAME="294"></A>by differentiation and growth of the embryo.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>Of viviparous animals, some hatch eggs in their own interior, as 
<A NAME="296"></A>creatures of the shark kind; others engender in their interior a live foetus, 
<A NAME="297"></A>as man and the horse. When the result of conception is perfected, with 
<A NAME="298"></A>some animals a living creature is brought forth, with others an egg is 
<A NAME="299"></A>brought to light, with others a grub. Of the eggs, some have egg-shells 
<A NAME="300"></A>and are of two different colours within, such as birds' eggs; others are 
<A NAME="301"></A>soft-skinned and of uniform colour, as the eggs of animals of the shark 
<A NAME="302"></A>kind. Of the grubs, some are from the first capable of movement, others 
<A NAME="303"></A>are motionless. However, with regard to these phenomena we shall speak 
<A NAME="304"></A>precisely hereafter when we come to treat of Generation.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore, some animals have feet and some are destitute thereof. 
<A NAME="306"></A>Of such as have feet some animals have two, as is the case with men and 
<A NAME="307"></A>birds, and with men and birds only; some have four, as the lizard and the 
<A NAME="308"></A>dog; some have more, as the centipede and the bee; but allsoever that have 
<A NAME="309"></A>feet have an even number of them.
<A NAME="310"></A><BR><BR>Of swimming creatures that are destitute of feet, some have winglets 
<A NAME="311"></A>or fins, as fishes: and of these some have four fins, two above on the 
<A NAME="312"></A>back, two below on the belly, as the gilthead and the basse; some have 
<A NAME="313"></A>two only,-to wit, such as are exceedingly long and smooth, as the eel and 
<A NAME="314"></A>the conger; some have none at all, as the muraena, but use the sea just 
<A NAME="315"></A>as snakes use dry ground-and by the way, snakes swim in water in just the 
<A NAME="316"></A>same way. Of the shark-kind some have no fins, such as those that are flat 
<A NAME="317"></A>and long-tailed, as the ray and the sting-ray, but these fishes swim actually 
<A NAME="318"></A>by the undulatory motion of their flat bodies; the fishing frog, however, 
<A NAME="319"></A>has fins, and so likewise have all such fishes as have not their flat surfaces 
<A NAME="320"></A>thinned off to a sharp edge.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>Of those swimming creatures that appear to have feet, as is the 
<A NAME="322"></A>case with the molluscs, these creatures swim by the aid of their feet and 
<A NAME="323"></A>their fins as well, and they swim most rapidly backwards in the direction 
<A NAME="324"></A>of the trunk, as is the case with the cuttle-fish or sepia and the calamary; 
<A NAME="325"></A>and, by the way, neither of these latter can walk as the poulpe or octopus 
<A NAME="326"></A>can.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>The hard-skinned or crustaceous animals, like the crawfish, swim 
<A NAME="328"></A>by the instrumentality of their tail-parts; and they swim most rapidly 
<A NAME="329"></A>tail foremost, by the aid of the fins developed upon that member. The newt 
<A NAME="330"></A>swims by means of its feet and tail; and its tail resembles that of the 
<A NAME="331"></A>sheatfish, to compare little with great.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>Of animals that can fly some are furnished with feathered wings, 
<A NAME="333"></A>as the eagle and the hawk; some are furnished with membranous wings, as 
<A NAME="334"></A>the bee and the cockchafer; others are furnished with leathern wings, as 
<A NAME="335"></A>the flying fox and the bat. All flying creatures possessed of blood have 
<A NAME="336"></A>feathered wings or leathern wings; the bloodless creatures have membranous 
<A NAME="337"></A>wings, as insects. The creatures that have feathered wings or leathern 
<A NAME="338"></A>wings have either two feet or no feet at all: for there are said to be 
<A NAME="339"></A>certain flying serpents in Ethiopia that are destitute of 
<A NAME="340"></A>feet.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>Creatures that have feathered wings are classed as a genus under 
<A NAME="342"></A>the name of 'bird'; the other two genera, the leathern-winged and membrane-winged, 
<A NAME="343"></A>are as yet without a generic title.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>Of creatures that can fly and are bloodless some are coleopterous 
<A NAME="345"></A>or sheath-winged, for they have their wings in a sheath or shard, like 
<A NAME="346"></A>the cockchafer and the dung-beetle; others are sheathless, and of these 
<A NAME="347"></A>latter some are dipterous and some tetrapterous: tetrapterous, such as 
<A NAME="348"></A>are comparatively large or have their stings in the tail, dipterous, such 
<A NAME="349"></A>as are comparatively small or have their stings in front. The coleoptera 
<A NAME="350"></A>are, without exception, devoid of stings; the diptera have the sting in 
<A NAME="351"></A>front, as the fly, the horsefly, the gadfly, and the 
<A NAME="352"></A>gnat.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>Bloodless animals as a general rule are inferior in point of size 
<A NAME="354"></A>to blooded animals; though, by the way, there are found in the sea some 
<A NAME="355"></A>few bloodless creatures of abnormal size, as in the case of certain molluscs. 
<A NAME="356"></A>And of these bloodless genera, those are the largest that dwell in milder 
<A NAME="357"></A>climates, and those that inhabit the sea are larger than those living on 
<A NAME="358"></A>dry land or in fresh water.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>All creatures that are capable of motion move with four or more 
<A NAME="360"></A>points of motion; the blooded animals with four only: as, for instance, 
<A NAME="361"></A>man with two hands and two feet, birds with two wings and two feet, quadrupeds 
<A NAME="362"></A>and fishes severally with four feet and four fins. Creatures that have 
<A NAME="363"></A>two winglets or fins, or that have none at all like serpents, move all 
<A NAME="364"></A>the same with not less than four points of motion; for there are four bends 
<A NAME="365"></A>in their bodies as they move, or two bends together with their fins. Bloodless 
<A NAME="366"></A>and many footed animals, whether furnished with wings or feet, move with 
<A NAME="367"></A>more than four points of motion; as, for instance, the dayfly moves with 
<A NAME="368"></A>four feet and four wings: and, I may observe in passing, this creature 
<A NAME="369"></A>is exceptional not only in regard to the duration of its existence, whence 
<A NAME="370"></A>it receives its name, but also because though a quadruped it has wings 
<A NAME="371"></A>also.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>All animals move alike, four-footed and many-footed; in other words, 
<A NAME="373"></A>they all move cross-corner-wise. And animals in general have two feet in 
<A NAME="374"></A>advance; the crab alone has four.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="375"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>Very extensive genera of animals, into which other subdivisions 
<A NAME="377"></A>fall, are the following: one, of birds; one, of fishes; and another, of 
<A NAME="378"></A>cetaceans. Now all these creatures are blooded.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>There is another genus of the hard-shell kind, which is called 
<A NAME="380"></A>oyster; another of the soft-shell kind, not as yet designated by a single 
<A NAME="381"></A>term, such as the spiny crawfish and the various kinds of crabs and lobsters; 
<A NAME="382"></A>and another of molluscs, as the two kinds of calamary and the cuttle-fish; 
<A NAME="383"></A>that of insects is different. All these latter creatures are bloodless, 
<A NAME="384"></A>and such of them as have feet have a goodly number of them; and of the 
<A NAME="385"></A>insects some have wings as well as feet.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>Of the other animals the genera are not extensive. For in them 
<A NAME="387"></A>one species does not comprehend many species; but in one case, as man, 
<A NAME="388"></A>the species is simple, admitting of no differentiation, while other cases 
<A NAME="389"></A>admit of differentiation, but the forms lack particular 
<A NAME="390"></A>designations.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>So, for instance, creatures that are qudapedal and unprovided with 
<A NAME="392"></A>wings are blooded without exception, but some of them are viviparous, and 
<A NAME="393"></A>some oviparous. Such as are viviparous are hair-coated, and such as are 
<A NAME="394"></A>oviparous are covered with a kind of tessellated hard substance; and the 
<A NAME="395"></A>tessellated bits of this substance are, as it were, similar in regard to 
<A NAME="396"></A>position to a scale.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>An animal that is blooded and capable of movement on dry land, 
<A NAME="398"></A>but is naturally unprovided with feet, belongs to the serpent genus; and 
<A NAME="399"></A>animals of this genus are coated with the tessellated horny substance. 
<A NAME="400"></A>Serpents in general are oviparous; the adder, an exceptional case, is viviparous: 
<A NAME="401"></A>for not all viviparous animals are hair-coated, and some fishes also are 
<A NAME="402"></A>viviparous.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>All animals, however, that are hair-coated are viviparous. For, 
<A NAME="404"></A>by the way, one must regard as a kind of hair such prickly hairs as hedgehogs 
<A NAME="405"></A>and porcupines carry; for these spines perform the office of hair, and 
<A NAME="406"></A>not of feet as is the case with similar parts of sea-urchins.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>In the genus that combines all viviparous quadrupeds are many species, 
<A NAME="408"></A>but under no common appellation. They are only named as it were one by 
<A NAME="409"></A>one, as we say man, lion, stag, horse, dog, and so on; though, by the way, 
<A NAME="410"></A>there is a sort of genus that embraces all creatures that have bushy manes 
<A NAME="411"></A>and bushy tails, such as the horse, the ass, the mule, the jennet, and 
<A NAME="412"></A>the animals that are called Hemioni in Syria,-from their externally resembling 
<A NAME="413"></A>mules, though they are not strictly of the same species. And that they 
<A NAME="414"></A>are not so is proved by the fact that they mate with and breed from one 
<A NAME="415"></A>another.  For all these reasons, we must take animals species by species, 
<A NAME="416"></A>and discuss their peculiarities severally'
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>These preceding statements, then, have been put forward thus in 
<A NAME="418"></A>a general way, as a kind of foretaste of the number of subjects and of 
<A NAME="419"></A>the properties that we have to consider in order that we may first get 
<A NAME="420"></A>a clear notion of distinctive character and common properties. By and by 
<A NAME="421"></A>we shall discuss these matters with greater minuteness.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>After this we shall pass on to the discussion of causes. For to 
<A NAME="423"></A>do this when the investigation of the details is complete is the proper 
<A NAME="424"></A>and natural method, and that whereby the subjects and the premisses of 
<A NAME="425"></A>our argument will afterwards be rendered plain.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>In the first place we must look to the constituent parts of animals. 
<A NAME="427"></A>For it is in a way relative to these parts, first and foremost, that animals 
<A NAME="428"></A>in their entirety differ from one another: either in the fact that some 
<A NAME="429"></A>have this or that, while they have not that or this; or by peculiarities 
<A NAME="430"></A>of position or of arrangement; or by the differences that have been previously 
<A NAME="431"></A>mentioned, depending upon diversity of form, or excess or defect in this 
<A NAME="432"></A>or that particular, on analogy, or on contrasts of the accidental 
<A NAME="433"></A>qualities.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>To begin with, we must take into consideration the parts of Man. 
<A NAME="435"></A>For, just as each nation is wont to reckon by that monetary standard with 
<A NAME="436"></A>which it is most familiar, so must we do in other matters. And, of course, 
<A NAME="437"></A>man is the animal with which we are all of us the most 
<A NAME="438"></A>familiar.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>Now the parts are obvious enough to physical perception. However, 
<A NAME="440"></A>with the view of observing due order and sequence and of combining rational 
<A NAME="441"></A>notions with physical perception, we shall proceed to enumerate the parts: 
<A NAME="442"></A>firstly, the organic, and afterwards the simple or non-composite.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="443"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>The chief parts into which the body as a whole is subdivided, are 
<A NAME="445"></A>the head, the neck, the trunk (extending from the neck to the privy parts), 
<A NAME="446"></A>which is called the thorax, two arms and two legs.
<A NAME="447"></A><BR><BR>Of the parts of which the head is composed the hair-covered portion 
<A NAME="448"></A>is called the 'skull'. The front portion of it is termed 'bregma' or 'sinciput', 
<A NAME="449"></A>developed after birth-for it is the last of all the bones in the body to 
<A NAME="450"></A>acquire solidity,-the hinder part is termed the 'occiput', and the part 
<A NAME="451"></A>intervening between the sinciput and the occiput is the 'crown'. The brain 
<A NAME="452"></A>lies underneath the sinciput; the occiput is hollow. The skull consists 
<A NAME="453"></A>entirely of thin bone, rounded in shape, and contained within a wrapper 
<A NAME="454"></A>of fleshless skin.
<A NAME="455"></A><BR><BR>The skull has sutures: one, of circular form, in the case of women; 
<A NAME="456"></A>in the case of men, as a general rule, three meeting at a point. Instances 
<A NAME="457"></A>have been known of a man's skull devoid of suture altogether. In the skull 
<A NAME="458"></A>the middle line, where the hair parts, is called the crown or vertex. In 
<A NAME="459"></A>some cases the parting is double; that is to say, some men are double crowned, 
<A NAME="460"></A>not in regard to the bony skull, but in consequence of the double fall 
<A NAME="461"></A>or set of the hair.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="462"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>The part that lies under the skull is called the 'face': but in 
<A NAME="464"></A>the case of man only, for the term is not applied to a fish or to an ox. 
<A NAME="465"></A>In the face the part below the sinciput and between the eyes is termed 
<A NAME="466"></A>the forehead. When men have large foreheads, they are slow to move; when 
<A NAME="467"></A>they have small ones, they are fickle; when they have broad ones, they 
<A NAME="468"></A>are apt to be distraught; when they have foreheads rounded or bulging out, 
<A NAME="469"></A>they are quick-tempered.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="470"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>Underneath the forehead are two eyebrows. Straight eyebrows are 
<A NAME="472"></A>a sign of softness of disposition; such as curve in towards the nose, of 
<A NAME="473"></A>harshness; such as curve out towards the temples, of humour and dissimulation; 
<A NAME="474"></A>such as are drawn in towards one another, of jealousy.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR>Under the eyebrows come the eyes. These are naturally two in number. 
<A NAME="476"></A>Each of them has an upper and a lower eyelid, and the hairs on the edges 
<A NAME="477"></A>of these are termed 'eyelashes'. The central part of the eye includes the 
<A NAME="478"></A>moist part whereby vision is effected, termed the 'pupil', and the part 
<A NAME="479"></A>surrounding it called the 'black'; the part outside this is the 'white'. 
<A NAME="480"></A>A part common to the upper and lower eyelid is a pair of nicks or corners, 
<A NAME="481"></A>one in the direction of the nose, and the other in the direction of the 
<A NAME="482"></A>temples. When these are long they are a sign of bad disposition; if the 
<A NAME="483"></A>side toward the nostril be fleshy and comb-like, they are a sign of 
<A NAME="484"></A>dishonesty.
<A NAME="485"></A><BR><BR>All animals, as a general rule, are provided with eyes, excepting 
<A NAME="486"></A>the ostracoderms and other imperfect creatures; at all events, all viviparous 
<A NAME="487"></A>animals have eyes, with the exception of the mole. And yet one might assert 
<A NAME="488"></A>that, though the mole has not eyes in the full sense, yet it has eyes in 
<A NAME="489"></A>a kind of a way. For in point of absolute fact it cannot see, and has no 
<A NAME="490"></A>eyes visible externally; but when the outer skin is removed, it is found 
<A NAME="491"></A>to have the place where eyes are usually situated, and the black parts 
<A NAME="492"></A>of the eyes rightly situated, and all the place that is usually devoted 
<A NAME="493"></A>on the outside to eyes: showing that the parts are stunted in development, 
<A NAME="494"></A>and the skin allowed to grow over.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="495"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="496"></A><BR><BR>Of the eye the white is pretty much the same in all creatures; 
<A NAME="497"></A>but what is called the black differs in various animals. Some have the 
<A NAME="498"></A>rim black, some distinctly blue, some greyish-blue, some greenish; and 
<A NAME="499"></A>this last colour is the sign of an excellent disposition, and is particularly 
<A NAME="500"></A>well adapted for sharpness of vision. Man is the only, or nearly the only, 
<A NAME="501"></A>creature, that has eyes of diverse colours. Animals, as a rule, have eyes 
<A NAME="502"></A>of one colour only. Some horses have blue eyes.
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR>Of eyes, some are large, some small, some medium-sized; of these, 
<A NAME="504"></A>the medium-sized are the best. Moreover, eyes sometimes protrude, sometimes 
<A NAME="505"></A>recede, sometimes are neither protruding nor receding. Of these, the receding 
<A NAME="506"></A>eye is in all animals the most acute; but the last kind are the sign of 
<A NAME="507"></A>the best disposition. Again, eyes are sometimes inclined to wink under 
<A NAME="508"></A>observation, sometimes to remain open and staring, and sometimes are disposed 
<A NAME="509"></A>neither to wink nor stare. The last kind are the sign of the best nature, 
<A NAME="510"></A>and of the others, the latter kind indicates impudence, and the former 
<A NAME="511"></A>indecision.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="512"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="513"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore, there is a portion of the head, whereby an animal 
<A NAME="514"></A>hears, a part incapable of breathing, the 'ear'. I say 'incapable of breathing', 
<A NAME="515"></A>for Alcmaeon is mistaken when he says that goats inspire through their 
<A NAME="516"></A>ears. Of the ear one part is unnamed, the other part is called the 'lobe'; 
<A NAME="517"></A>and it is entirely composed of gristle and flesh. The ear is constructed 
<A NAME="518"></A>internally like the trumpet-shell, and the innermost bone is like the ear 
<A NAME="519"></A>itself, and into it at the end the sound makes its way, as into the bottom 
<A NAME="520"></A>of a jar. This receptacle does not communicate by any passage with the 
<A NAME="521"></A>brain, but does so with the palate, and a vein extends from the brain towards 
<A NAME="522"></A>it. The eyes also are connected with the brain, and each of them lies at 
<A NAME="523"></A>the end of a little vein. Of animals possessed of ears man is the only 
<A NAME="524"></A>one that cannot move this organ. Of creatures possessed of hearing, some 
<A NAME="525"></A>have ears, whilst others have none, but merely have the passages for ears 
<A NAME="526"></A>visible, as, for example, feathered animals or animals coated with horny 
<A NAME="527"></A>tessellates.
<A NAME="528"></A><BR><BR>Viviparous animals, with the exception of the seal, the dolphin, 
<A NAME="529"></A>and those others which after a similar fashion to these are cetaceans, 
<A NAME="530"></A>are all provided with ears; for, by the way, the shark-kind are also viviparous. 
<A NAME="531"></A>Now, the seal has the passages visible whereby it hears; but the dolphin 
<A NAME="532"></A>can hear, but has no ears, nor yet any passages visible. But man alone 
<A NAME="533"></A>is unable to move his ears, and all other animals can move them. And the 
<A NAME="534"></A>ears lie, with man, in the same horizontal plane with the eyes, and not 
<A NAME="535"></A>in a plane above them as is the case with some quadrupeds. Of ears, some 
<A NAME="536"></A>are fine, some are coarse, and some are of medium texture; the last kind 
<A NAME="537"></A>are best for hearing, but they serve in no way to indicate character. Some 
<A NAME="538"></A>ears are large, some small, some medium-sized; again, some stand out far, 
<A NAME="539"></A>some lie in close and tight, and some take up a medium position; of these 
<A NAME="540"></A>such as are of medium size and of medium position are indications of the 
<A NAME="541"></A>best disposition, while the large and outstanding ones indicate a tendency 
<A NAME="542"></A>to irrelevant talk or chattering. The part intercepted between the eye, 
<A NAME="543"></A>the ear, and the crown is termed the 'temple'. Again, there is a part of 
<A NAME="544"></A>the countenance that serves as a passage for the breath, the 'nose'. For 
<A NAME="545"></A>a man inhales and exhales by this organ, and sneezing is effected by its 
<A NAME="546"></A>means: which last is an outward rush of collected breath, and is the only 
<A NAME="547"></A>mode of breath used as an omen and regarded as supernatural. Both inhalation 
<A NAME="548"></A>and exhalation go right on from the nose towards the chest; and with the 
<A NAME="549"></A>nostrils alone and separately it is impossible to inhale or exhale, owing 
<A NAME="550"></A>to the fact that the inspiration and respiration take place from the chest 
<A NAME="551"></A>along the windpipe, and not by any portion connected with the head; and 
<A NAME="552"></A>indeed it is possible for a creature to live without using this process 
<A NAME="553"></A>of nasal respiration.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>Again, smelling takes place by means of the nose,-smelling, or 
<A NAME="555"></A>the sensible discrimination of odour. And the nostril admits of easy motion, 
<A NAME="556"></A>and is not, like the ear, intrinsically immovable. A part of it, composed 
<A NAME="557"></A>of gristle, constitutes, a septum or partition, and part is an open passage; 
<A NAME="558"></A>for the nostril consists of two separate channels. The nostril (or nose) 
<A NAME="559"></A>of the elephant is long and strong, and the animal uses it like a hand; 
<A NAME="560"></A>for by means of this organ it draws objects towards it, and takes hold 
<A NAME="561"></A>of them, and introduces its food into its mouth, whether liquid or dry 
<A NAME="562"></A>food, and it is the only living creature that does so.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore, there are two jaws; the front part of them constitutes 
<A NAME="564"></A>the chin, and the hinder part the cheek. All animals move the lower jaw, 
<A NAME="565"></A>with the exception of the river crocodile; this creature moves the upper 
<A NAME="566"></A>jaw only.
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR>Next after the nose come two lips, composed of flesh, and facile 
<A NAME="568"></A>of motion. The mouth lies inside the jaws and lips. Parts of the mouth 
<A NAME="569"></A>are the roof or palate and the pharynx.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR>The part that is sensible of taste is the tongue. The sensation 
<A NAME="571"></A>has its seat at the tip of the tongue; if the object to be tasted be placed 
<A NAME="572"></A>on the flat surface of the organ, the taste is less sensibly experienced. 
<A NAME="573"></A>The tongue is sensitive in all other ways wherein flesh in general is so: 
<A NAME="574"></A>that is, it can appreciate hardness, or warmth and cold, in any part of 
<A NAME="575"></A>it, just as it can appreciate taste. The tongue is sometimes broad, sometimes 
<A NAME="576"></A>narrow, and sometimes of medium width; the last kind is the best and the 
<A NAME="577"></A>clearest in its discrimination of taste. Moreover, the tongue is sometimes 
<A NAME="578"></A>loosely hung, and sometimes fastened: as in the case of those who mumble 
<A NAME="579"></A>and who lisp.
<A NAME="580"></A><BR><BR>The tongue consists of flesh, soft and spongy, and the so-called 
<A NAME="581"></A>'epiglottis' is a part of this organ.
<A NAME="582"></A><BR><BR>That part of the mouth that splits into two bits is called the 
<A NAME="583"></A>'tonsils'; that part that splits into many bits, the 'gums'. Both the tonsils 
<A NAME="584"></A>and the gums are composed of flesh. In the gums are teeth, composed of 
<A NAME="585"></A>bone.
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR>Inside the mouth is another part, shaped like a bunch of grapes, 
<A NAME="587"></A>a pillar streaked with veins. If this pillar gets relaxed and inflamed 
<A NAME="588"></A>it is called 'uvula' or 'bunch of grapes', and it then has a tendency to 
<A NAME="589"></A>bring about suffocation.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="590"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="591"></A><BR><BR>The neck is the part between the face and the trunk. Of this the 
<A NAME="592"></A>front part is the larynx land the back part the ur The front part, composed 
<A NAME="593"></A>of gristle, through which respiration and speech is effected, is termed 
<A NAME="594"></A>the 'windpipe'; the part that is fleshy is the oesophagus, inside just 
<A NAME="595"></A>in front of the chine. The part to the back of the neck is the epomis, 
<A NAME="596"></A>or 'shoulder-point'.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>These then are the parts to be met with before you come to the 
<A NAME="598"></A>thorax.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>To the trunk there is a front part and a back part. Next after 
<A NAME="600"></A>the neck in the front part is the chest, with a pair of breasts. To each 
<A NAME="601"></A>of the breasts is attached a teat or nipple, through which in the case 
<A NAME="602"></A>of females the milk percolates; and the breast is of a spongy texture. 
<A NAME="603"></A>Milk, by the way, is found at times in the male; but with the male the 
<A NAME="604"></A>flesh of the breast is tough, with the female it is soft and 
<A NAME="605"></A>porous.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="606"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>Next after the thorax and in front comes the 'belly', and its root 
<A NAME="608"></A>the 'navel'. Underneath this root the bilateral part is the 'flank': the 
<A NAME="609"></A>undivided part below the navel, the 'abdomen', the extremity of which is 
<A NAME="610"></A>the region of the 'pubes'; above the navel the 'hypochondrium'; the cavity 
<A NAME="611"></A>common to the hypochondrium and the flank is the gut-cavity.
<A NAME="612"></A><BR><BR>Serving as a brace girdle to the hinder parts is the pelvis, and 
<A NAME="613"></A>hence it gets its name (osphus), for it is symmetrical (isophues) in appearance; 
<A NAME="614"></A>of the fundament the part for resting on is termed the 'rump', and the 
<A NAME="615"></A>part whereon the thigh pivots is termed the 'socket' (or 
<A NAME="616"></A>acetabulum).
<A NAME="617"></A><BR><BR>The 'womb' is a part peculiar to the female; and the 'penis' is 
<A NAME="618"></A>peculiar to the male. This latter organ is external and situated at the 
<A NAME="619"></A>extremity of the trunk; it is composed of two separate parts: of which 
<A NAME="620"></A>the extreme part is fleshy, does not alter in size, and is called the glans; 
<A NAME="621"></A>and round about it is a skin devoid of any specific title, which integument 
<A NAME="622"></A>if it be cut asunder never grows together again, any more than does the 
<A NAME="623"></A>jaw or the eyelid. And the connexion between the latter and the glans is 
<A NAME="624"></A>called the frenum. The remaining part of the penis is composed of gristle; 
<A NAME="625"></A>it is easily susceptible of enlargement; and it protrudes and recedes in 
<A NAME="626"></A>the reverse directions to what is observable in the identical organ in 
<A NAME="627"></A>cats. Underneath the penis are two 'testicles', and the integument of these 
<A NAME="628"></A>is a skin that is termed the 'scrotum'.
<A NAME="629"></A><BR><BR>Testicles are not identical with flesh, and are not altogether 
<A NAME="630"></A>diverse from it. But by and by we shall treat in an exhaustive way regarding 
<A NAME="631"></A>all such parts.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="632"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="633"></A><BR><BR>The privy part of the female is in character opposite to that of 
<A NAME="634"></A>the male. In other words, the part under the pubes is hollow or receding, 
<A NAME="635"></A>and not, like the male organ, protruding. Further, there is an 'urethra' 
<A NAME="636"></A>outside the womb; which organ serves as a passage for the sperm of the 
<A NAME="637"></A>male, and as an outlet for liquid excretion to both 
<A NAME="638"></A>sexes).
<A NAME="639"></A><BR><BR>The part common to the neck and chest is the 'throat'; the 'armpit' 
<A NAME="640"></A>is common to side, arm, and shoulder; and the 'groin' is common to thigh 
<A NAME="641"></A>and abdomen. The part inside the thigh and buttocks is the 'perineum', 
<A NAME="642"></A>and the part outside the thigh and buttocks is the 'hypoglutis'.
<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR>The front parts of the trunk have now been enumerated.
<A NAME="644"></A><BR>The part behind the chest is termed the 'back'.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="645"></A><B>Part 15</B>

<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>Parts of the back are a pair of 'shoulderblades', the 'back-bone', 
<A NAME="647"></A>and, underneath on a level with the belly in the trunk, the 'loins'. Common 
<A NAME="648"></A>to the upper and lower part of the trunk are the 'ribs', eight on either 
<A NAME="649"></A>side, for as to the so-called seven-ribbed Ligyans we have not received 
<A NAME="650"></A>any trustworthy evidence.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR>Man, then, has an upper and a lower part, a front and a back part, 
<A NAME="652"></A>a right and a left side. Now the right and the left side are pretty well 
<A NAME="653"></A>alike in their parts and identical throughout, except that the left side 
<A NAME="654"></A>is the weaker of the two; but the back parts do not resemble the front 
<A NAME="655"></A>ones, neither do the lower ones the upper: only that these upper and lower 
<A NAME="656"></A>parts may be said to resemble one another thus far, that, if the face be 
<A NAME="657"></A>plump or meagre, the abdomen is plump or meagre to correspond; and that 
<A NAME="658"></A>the legs correspond to the arms, and where the upper arm is short the thigh 
<A NAME="659"></A>is usually short also, and where the feet are small the hands are small 
<A NAME="660"></A>correspondingly.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR>Of the limbs, one set, forming a pair, is 'arms'. To the arm belong 
<A NAME="662"></A>the 'shoulder', 'upper-arm', 'elbow', 'fore-arm', and 'hand'. To the hand 
<A NAME="663"></A>belong the 'palm', and the five 'fingers'. The part of the finger that 
<A NAME="664"></A>bends is termed 'knuckle', the part that is inflexible is termed the 'phalanx'. 
<A NAME="665"></A>The big finger or thumb is single-jointed, the other fingers are double 
<A NAME="666"></A>jointed. The bending both of the arm and of the finger takes place from 
<A NAME="667"></A>without inwards in all cases; and the arm bends at the elbow. The inner 
<A NAME="668"></A>part of the hand is termed the palm', and is fleshy and divided by joints 
<A NAME="669"></A>or lines: in the case of long-lived people by one or two extending right 
<A NAME="670"></A>across, in the case of the short-lived by two, not so extending. The joint 
<A NAME="671"></A>between hand and arm is termed the 'wrist'. The outside or back of the 
<A NAME="672"></A>hand is sinewy, and has no specific designation.
<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR>There is another duplicate limb, the 'leg'. Of this limb the double-knobbed 
<A NAME="674"></A>part is termed the 'thigh-bone', the sliding part of the 'kneecap', the 
<A NAME="675"></A>double-boned part the 'leg'; the front part of this latter is termed the 
<A NAME="676"></A>'shin', and the part behind it the 'calf', wherein the flesh is sinewy 
<A NAME="677"></A>and venous, in some cases drawn upwards towards the hollow behind the knee, 
<A NAME="678"></A>as in the case of people with large hips, and in other cases drawn downwards. 
<A NAME="679"></A>The lower extremity of the shin is the 'ankle', duplicate in either leg. 
<A NAME="680"></A>The part of the limb that contains a multiplicity of bones is the 'foot'. 
<A NAME="681"></A>The hinder part of the foot is the 'heel'; at the front of it the divided 
<A NAME="682"></A>part consists of 'toes', five in number; the fleshy part underneath is 
<A NAME="683"></A>the 'ball'; the upper part or back of the foot is sinewy and has no particular 
<A NAME="684"></A>appellation; of the toe, one portion is the 'nail' and another the 'joint', 
<A NAME="685"></A>and the nail is in all cases at the extremity; and toes are without exception 
<A NAME="686"></A>single jointed. Men that have the inside or sole of the foot clumsy and 
<A NAME="687"></A>not arched, that is, that walk resting on the entire under-surface of their 
<A NAME="688"></A>feet, are prone to roguery. The joint common to thigh and shin is the 
<A NAME="689"></A>'knee'.
<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>These, then, are the parts common to the male and the female sex. 
<A NAME="691"></A>The relative position of the parts as to up and down, or to front and back, 
<A NAME="692"></A>or to right and left, all this as regards externals might safely be left 
<A NAME="693"></A>to mere ordinary perception. But for all that, we must treat of them for 
<A NAME="694"></A>the same reason as the one previously brought forward; that is to say, 
<A NAME="695"></A>we must refer to them in order that a due and regular sequence may be observed 
<A NAME="696"></A>in our exposition, and in order that by the enumeration of these obvious 
<A NAME="697"></A>facts due attention may be subsequently given to those parts in men and 
<A NAME="698"></A>other animals that are diverse in any way from one another.
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>In man, above all other animals, the terms 'upper' and 'lower' 
<A NAME="700"></A>are used in harmony with their natural positions; for in him, upper and 
<A NAME="701"></A>lower have the same meaning as when they are applied to the universe as 
<A NAME="702"></A>a whole. In like manner the terms, 'in front', 'behind', 'right' and 'left', 
<A NAME="703"></A>are used in accordance with their natural sense. But in regard to other 
<A NAME="704"></A>animals, in some cases these distinctions do not exist, and in others they 
<A NAME="705"></A>do so, but in a vague way. For instance, the head with all animals is up 
<A NAME="706"></A>and above in respect to their bodies; but man alone, as has been said, 
<A NAME="707"></A>has, in maturity, this part uppermost in respect to the material 
<A NAME="708"></A>universe.
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR>Next after the head comes the neck, and then the chest and the 
<A NAME="710"></A>back: the one in front and the other behind. Next after these come the 
<A NAME="711"></A>belly, the loins, the sexual parts, and the haunches; then the thigh and 
<A NAME="712"></A>shin; and, lastly, the feet.
<A NAME="713"></A><BR><BR>The legs bend frontwards, in the direction of actual progression, 
<A NAME="714"></A>and frontwards also lies that part of the foot which is the most effective 
<A NAME="715"></A>of motion, and the flexure of that part; but the heel lies at the back, 
<A NAME="716"></A>and the anklebones lie laterally, earwise. The arms are situated to right 
<A NAME="717"></A>and left, and bend inwards: so that the convexities formed by bent arms 
<A NAME="718"></A>and legs are practically face to face with one another in the case of 
<A NAME="719"></A>man.
<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR>As for the senses and for the organs of sensation, the eyes, the 
<A NAME="721"></A>nostrils, and the tongue, all alike are situated frontwards; the sense 
<A NAME="722"></A>of hearing, and the organ of hearing, the ear, is situated sideways, on 
<A NAME="723"></A>the same horizontal plane with the eyes. The eyes in man are, in proportion 
<A NAME="724"></A>to his size, nearer to one another than in any other 
<A NAME="725"></A>animal.
<A NAME="726"></A><BR><BR>Of the senses man has the sense of touch more refined than any 
<A NAME="727"></A>animal, and so also, but in less degree, the sense of taste; in the development 
<A NAME="728"></A>of the other senses he is surpassed by a great number of 
<A NAME="729"></A>animals.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="730"></A><B>Part 16</B>

<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>The parts, then, that are externally visible are arranged in the 
<A NAME="732"></A>way above stated, and as a rule have their special designations, and from 
<A NAME="733"></A>use and wont are known familiarly to all; but this is not the case with 
<A NAME="734"></A>the inner parts. For the fact is that the inner parts of man are to a very 
<A NAME="735"></A>great extent unknown, and the consequence is that we must have recourse 
<A NAME="736"></A>to an examination of the inner parts of other animals whose nature in any 
<A NAME="737"></A>way resembles that of man.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>In the first place then, the brain lies in the front part of the 
<A NAME="739"></A>head. And this holds alike with all animals possessed of a brain; and all 
<A NAME="740"></A>blooded animals are possessed thereof, and, by the way, molluscs as well. 
<A NAME="741"></A>But, taking size for size of animal, the largest brain, and the moistest, 
<A NAME="742"></A>is that of man. Two membranes enclose it: the stronger one near the bone 
<A NAME="743"></A>of the skull; the inner one, round the brain itself, is finer. The brain 
<A NAME="744"></A>in all cases is bilateral. Behind this, right at the back, comes what is 
<A NAME="745"></A>termed the 'cerebellum', differing in form from the brain as we may both 
<A NAME="746"></A>feel and see.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>The back of the head is with all animals empty and hollow, whatever 
<A NAME="748"></A>be its size in the different animals. For some creatures have big heads 
<A NAME="749"></A>while the face below is small in proportion, as is the case with round-faced 
<A NAME="750"></A>animals; some have little heads and long jaws, as is the case, without 
<A NAME="751"></A>exception, among animals of the mane-and-tail species.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR>The brain in all animals is bloodless, devoid of veins, and naturally 
<A NAME="753"></A>cold to the touch; in the great majority of animals it has a small hollow 
<A NAME="754"></A>in its centre. The brain-caul around it is reticulated with veins; and 
<A NAME="755"></A>this brain-caul is that skin-like membrane which closely surrounds the 
<A NAME="756"></A>brain. Above the brain is the thinnest and weakest bone of the head, which 
<A NAME="757"></A>is termed or 'sinciput'.
<A NAME="758"></A><BR><BR>From the eye there go three ducts to the brain: the largest and 
<A NAME="759"></A>the medium-sized to the cerebellum, the least to the brain itself; and 
<A NAME="760"></A>the least is the one situated nearest to the nostril. The two largest ones, 
<A NAME="761"></A>then, run side by side and do not meet; the medium-sized ones meet-and 
<A NAME="762"></A>this is particularly visible in fishes,-for they lie nearer than the large 
<A NAME="763"></A>ones to the brain; the smallest pair are the most widely separate from 
<A NAME="764"></A>one another, and do not meet.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR>Inside the neck is what is termed the oesophagus (whose other name 
<A NAME="766"></A>is derived oesophagus from its length and narrowness), and the windpipe. 
<A NAME="767"></A>The windpipe is situated in front of the oesophagus in all animals that 
<A NAME="768"></A>have a windpipe, and all animals have one that are furnished with lungs. 
<A NAME="769"></A>The windpipe is made up of gristle, is sparingly supplied with blood, and 
<A NAME="770"></A>is streaked all round with numerous minute veins; it is situated, in its 
<A NAME="771"></A>upper part, near the mouth, below the aperture formed by the nostrils into 
<A NAME="772"></A>the mouth-an aperture through which, when men, in drinking, inhale any 
<A NAME="773"></A>of the liquid, this liquid finds its way out through the nostrils. In betwixt 
<A NAME="774"></A>the two openings comes the so-called epiglottis, an organ capable of being 
<A NAME="775"></A>drawn over and covering the orifice of the windpipe communicating with 
<A NAME="776"></A>the mouth; the end of the tongue is attached to the epiglottis. In the 
<A NAME="777"></A>other direction the windpipe extends to the interval between the lungs, 
<A NAME="778"></A>and hereupon bifurcates into each of the two divisions of the lung; for 
<A NAME="779"></A>the lung in all animals possessed of the organ has a tendency to be double. 
<A NAME="780"></A>In viviparous animals, however, the duplication is not so plainly discernible 
<A NAME="781"></A>as in other species, and the duplication is least discernible in man. And 
<A NAME="782"></A>in man the organ is not split into many parts, as is the case with some 
<A NAME="783"></A>vivipara, neither is it smooth, but its surface is uneven.
<A NAME="784"></A><BR><BR>In the case of the ovipara, such as birds and oviparous quadrupeds, 
<A NAME="785"></A>the two parts of the organ are separated to a distance from one another, 
<A NAME="786"></A>so that the creatures appear to be furnished with a pair of lungs; and 
<A NAME="787"></A>from the windpipe, itself single, there branch off two separate parts extending 
<A NAME="788"></A>to each of the two divisions of the lung. It is attached also to the great 
<A NAME="789"></A>vein and to what is designated the 'aorta'. When the windpipe is charged 
<A NAME="790"></A>with air, the air passes on to the hollow parts of the lung. These parts 
<A NAME="791"></A>have divisions, composed of gristle, which meet at an acute angle; from 
<A NAME="792"></A>the divisions run passages through the entire lung, giving off smaller 
<A NAME="793"></A>and smaller ramifications. The heart also is attached to the windpipe, 
<A NAME="794"></A>by connexions of fat, gristle, and sinew; and at the point of juncture 
<A NAME="795"></A>there is a hollow. When the windpipe is charged with air, the entrance 
<A NAME="796"></A>of the air into the heart, though imperceptible in some animals, is perceptible 
<A NAME="797"></A>enough in the larger ones. Such are the properties of the windpipe, and 
<A NAME="798"></A>it takes in and throws out air only, and takes in nothing else either dry 
<A NAME="799"></A>or liquid, or else it causes you pain until you shall have coughed up whatever 
<A NAME="800"></A>may have gone down.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR><BR>The oesophagus communicates at the top with the mouth, close to 
<A NAME="802"></A>the windpipe, and is attached to the backbone and the windpipe by membranous 
<A NAME="803"></A>ligaments, and at last finds its way through the midriff into the belly. 
<A NAME="804"></A>It is composed of flesh-like substance, and is elastic both lengthways 
<A NAME="805"></A>and breadthways.
<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR>The stomach of man resembles that of a dog; for it is not much 
<A NAME="807"></A>bigger than the bowel, but is somewhat like a bowel of more than usual 
<A NAME="808"></A>width; then comes the bowel, single, convoluted, moderately wide. The lower 
<A NAME="809"></A>part of the gut is like that of a pig; for it is broad, and the part from 
<A NAME="810"></A>it to the buttocks is thick and short. The caul, or great omentum, is attached 
<A NAME="811"></A>to the middle of the stomach, and consists of a fatty membrane, as is the 
<A NAME="812"></A>case with all other animals whose stomachs are single and which have teeth 
<A NAME="813"></A>in both jaws.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR><BR>The mesentery is over the bowels; this also is membranous and broad, 
<A NAME="815"></A>and turns to fat. It is attached to the great vein and the aorta, and there 
<A NAME="816"></A>run through it a number of veins closely packed together, extending towards 
<A NAME="817"></A>the region of the bowels, beginning above and ending 
<A NAME="818"></A>below.
<A NAME="819"></A><BR><BR>So much for the properties of the oesophagus, the windpipe, and 
<A NAME="820"></A>the stomach.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="821"></A><B>Part 17</B>

<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR>The heart has three cavities, and is situated above the lung at 
<A NAME="823"></A>the division of the windpipe, and is provided with a fatty and thick membrane 
<A NAME="824"></A>where it fastens on to the great vein and the aorta. It lies with its tapering 
<A NAME="825"></A>portion upon the aorta, and this portion is similarly situated in relation 
<A NAME="826"></A>to the chest in all animals that have a chest. In all animals alike, in 
<A NAME="827"></A>those that have a chest and in those that have none, the apex of the heart 
<A NAME="828"></A>points forwards, although this fact might possibly escape notice by a change 
<A NAME="829"></A>of position under dissection. The rounded end of the heart is at the top. 
<A NAME="830"></A>The apex is to a great extent fleshy and close in texture, and in the cavities 
<A NAME="831"></A>of the heart are sinews. As a rule the heart is situated in the middle 
<A NAME="832"></A>of the chest in animals that have a chest, and in man it is situated a 
<A NAME="833"></A>little to the left-hand side, leaning a little way from the division of 
<A NAME="834"></A>the breasts towards the left breast in the upper part of the 
<A NAME="835"></A>chest.
<A NAME="836"></A><BR><BR>The heart is not large, and in its general shape it is not elongated; 
<A NAME="837"></A>in fact, it is somewhat round in form: only, be it remembered, it is sharp-pointed 
<A NAME="838"></A>at the bottom. It has three cavities, as has been said: the right-hand 
<A NAME="839"></A>one the largest of the three, the left-hand one the least, and the middle 
<A NAME="840"></A>one intermediate in size. All these cavities, even the two small ones, 
<A NAME="841"></A>are connected by passages with the lung, and this fact is rendered quite 
<A NAME="842"></A>plain in one of the cavities. And below, at the point of attachment, in 
<A NAME="843"></A>the largest cavity there is a connexion with the great vein (near which 
<A NAME="844"></A>the mesentery lies); and in the middle one there is a connexion with the 
<A NAME="845"></A>aorta.
<A NAME="846"></A><BR><BR>Canals lead from the heart into the lung, and branch off just as 
<A NAME="847"></A>the windpipe does, running all over the lung parallel with the passages 
<A NAME="848"></A>from the windpipe. The canals from the heart are uppermost; and there is 
<A NAME="849"></A>no common passage, but the passages through their having a common wall 
<A NAME="850"></A>receive the breath and pass it on to the heart; and one of the passages 
<A NAME="851"></A>conveys it to the right cavity, and the other to the 
<A NAME="852"></A>left.
<A NAME="853"></A><BR><BR>With regard to the great vein and the aorta we shall, by and by, 
<A NAME="854"></A>treat of them together in a discussion devoted to them and to them alone. 
<A NAME="855"></A>In all animals that are furnished with a lung, and that are both internally 
<A NAME="856"></A>and externally viviparous, the lung is of all organs the most richly supplied 
<A NAME="857"></A>with blood; for the lung is throughout spongy in texture, and along by 
<A NAME="858"></A>every single pore in it go branches from the great vein. Those who imagine 
<A NAME="859"></A>it to be empty are altogether mistaken; and they are led into their error 
<A NAME="860"></A>by their observation of lungs removed from animals under dissection, out 
<A NAME="861"></A>of which organs the blood had all escaped immediately after 
<A NAME="862"></A>death.
<A NAME="863"></A><BR><BR>Of the other internal organs the heart alone contains blood. And 
<A NAME="864"></A>the lung has blood not in itself but in its veins, but the heart has blood 
<A NAME="865"></A>in itself; for in each of its three cavities it has blood, but the thinnest 
<A NAME="866"></A>blood is what it has in its central cavity.
<A NAME="867"></A><BR><BR>Under the lung comes the thoracic diaphragm or midriff, attached 
<A NAME="868"></A>to the ribs, the hypochondria and the backbone, with a thin membrane in 
<A NAME="869"></A>the middle of it. It has veins running through it; and the diaphragm in 
<A NAME="870"></A>the case of man is thicker in proportion to the size of his frame than 
<A NAME="871"></A>in other animals.
<A NAME="872"></A><BR><BR>Under the diaphragm on the right-hand side lies the 'liver', and 
<A NAME="873"></A>on the left-hand side the 'spleen', alike in all animals that are provided 
<A NAME="874"></A>with these organs in an ordinary and not preternatural way; for, be it 
<A NAME="875"></A>observed, in some quadrupeds these organs have been found in a transposed 
<A NAME="876"></A>position. These organs are connected with the stomach by the 
<A NAME="877"></A>caul.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR>To outward view the spleen of man is narrow and long, resembling 
<A NAME="879"></A>the self-same organ in the pig. The liver in the great majority of animals 
<A NAME="880"></A>is not provided with a 'gall-bladder'; but the latter is present in some. 
<A NAME="881"></A>The liver of a man is round-shaped, and resembles the same organ in the 
<A NAME="882"></A>ox. And, by the way, the absence above referred to of a gall-bladder is 
<A NAME="883"></A>at times met with in the practice of augury. For instance, in a certain 
<A NAME="884"></A>district of the Chalcidic settlement in Euboea the sheep are devoid of 
<A NAME="885"></A>gall-bladders; and in Naxos nearly all the quadrupeds have one so large 
<A NAME="886"></A>that foreigners when they offer sacrifice with such victims are bewildered 
<A NAME="887"></A>with fright, under the impression that the phenomenon is not due to natural 
<A NAME="888"></A>causes, but bodes some mischief to the individual offerers of the 
<A NAME="889"></A>sacrifice.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR>Again, the liver is attached to the great vein, but it has no communication 
<A NAME="891"></A>with the aorta; for the vein that goes off from the great vein goes right 
<A NAME="892"></A>through the liver, at a point where are the so-called 'portals' of the 
<A NAME="893"></A>liver. The spleen also is connected only with the great vein, for a vein 
<A NAME="894"></A>extends to the spleen off from it.
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR>After these organs come the 'kidneys', and these are placed close 
<A NAME="896"></A>to the backbone, and resemble in character the same organ in kine. In all 
<A NAME="897"></A>animals that are provided with this organ, the right kidney is situated 
<A NAME="898"></A>higher up than the other. It has also less fatty substance than the left-hand 
<A NAME="899"></A>one and is less moist. And this phenomenon also is observable in all the 
<A NAME="900"></A>other animals alike.
<A NAME="901"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore, passages or ducts lead into the kidneys both from 
<A NAME="902"></A>the great vein and from the aorta, only not into the cavity. For, by the 
<A NAME="903"></A>way, there is a cavity in the middle of the kidney, bigger in some creatures 
<A NAME="904"></A>and less in others; but there is none in the case of the seal. This latter 
<A NAME="905"></A>animal has kidneys resembling in shape the identical organ in kine, but 
<A NAME="906"></A>in its case the organs are more solid than in any other known creature. 
<A NAME="907"></A>The ducts that lead into the kidneys lose themselves in the substance of 
<A NAME="908"></A>the kidneys themselves; and the proof that they extend no farther rests 
<A NAME="909"></A>on the fact that they contain no blood, nor is any clot found therein. 
<A NAME="910"></A>The kidneys, however, have, as has been said, a small cavity. From this 
<A NAME="911"></A>cavity in the kidney there lead two considerable ducts or ureters into 
<A NAME="912"></A>the bladder; and others spring from the aorta, strong and continuous. And 
<A NAME="913"></A>to the middle of each of the two kidneys is attached a hollow sinewy vein, 
<A NAME="914"></A>stretching right along the spine through the narrows; by and by these veins 
<A NAME="915"></A>are lost in either loin, and again become visible extending to the flank. 
<A NAME="916"></A>And these off-branchings of the veins terminate in the bladder. For the 
<A NAME="917"></A>bladder lies at the extremity, and is held in position by the ducts stretching 
<A NAME="918"></A>from the kidneys, along the stalk that extends to the urethra; and pretty 
<A NAME="919"></A>well all round it is fastened by fine sinewy membranes, that resemble to 
<A NAME="920"></A>some extent the thoracic diaphragm. The bladder in man is, proportionately 
<A NAME="921"></A>to his size, tolerably large.
<A NAME="922"></A><BR><BR>To the stalk of the bladder the private part is attached, the external 
<A NAME="923"></A>orifices coalescing; but a little lower down, one of the openings communicates 
<A NAME="924"></A>with the testicles and the other with the bladder. The penis is gristly 
<A NAME="925"></A>and sinewy in its texture. With it are connected the testicles in male 
<A NAME="926"></A>animals, and the properties of these organs we shall discuss in our general 
<A NAME="927"></A>account of the said organ.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR><BR>All these organs are similar in the female; for there is no difference 
<A NAME="929"></A>in regard to the internal organs, except in respect to the womb, and with 
<A NAME="930"></A>reference to the appearance of this organ I must refer the reader to diagrams 
<A NAME="931"></A>in my 'Anatomy'. The womb, however, is situated over the bowel, and the 
<A NAME="932"></A>bladder lies over the womb. But we must treat by and by in our pages of 
<A NAME="933"></A>the womb of all female animals viewed generally. For the wombs of all female 
<A NAME="934"></A>animals are not identical, neither do their local dispositions 
<A NAME="935"></A>coincide.
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR>These are the organs, internal and external, of man, and such is 
<A NAME="937"></A>their nature and such their local disposition.
