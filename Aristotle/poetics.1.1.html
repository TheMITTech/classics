<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part I</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>I propose to treat of Poetry in itself and of its various kinds, noting 
<A NAME="12"></A>the essential quality of each, to inquire into the structure of the plot 
<A NAME="13"></A>as requisite to a good poem; into the number and nature of the parts of 
<A NAME="14"></A>which a poem is composed; and similarly into whatever else falls within 
<A NAME="15"></A>the same inquiry. Following, then, the order of nature, let us begin with 
<A NAME="16"></A>the principles which come first.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>Epic poetry and Tragedy, Comedy also and Dithyrambic poetry, and 
<A NAME="18"></A>the music of the flute and of the lyre in most of their forms, are all 
<A NAME="19"></A>in their general conception modes of imitation. They differ, however, from 
<A NAME="20"></A>one another in three respects- the medium, the objects, the manner or mode 
<A NAME="21"></A>of imitation, being in each case distinct.
<A NAME="22"></A><BR><BR>For as there are persons who, by conscious art or mere habit, imitate 
<A NAME="23"></A>and represent various objects through the medium of color and form, or 
<A NAME="24"></A>again by the voice; so in the arts above mentioned, taken as a whole, the 
<A NAME="25"></A>imitation is produced by rhythm, language, or 'harmony,' either singly 
<A NAME="26"></A>or combined.
<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>Thus in the music of the flute and of the lyre, 'harmony' and rhythm 
<A NAME="28"></A>alone are employed; also in other arts, such as that of the shepherd's 
<A NAME="29"></A>pipe, which are essentially similar to these. In dancing, rhythm alone 
<A NAME="30"></A>is used without 'harmony'; for even dancing imitates character, emotion, 
<A NAME="31"></A>and action, by rhythmical movement.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>There is another art which imitates by means of language alone, 
<A NAME="33"></A>and that either in prose or verse- which verse, again, may either combine 
<A NAME="34"></A>different meters or consist of but one kind- but this has hitherto been 
<A NAME="35"></A>without a name. For there is no common term we could apply to the mimes 
<A NAME="36"></A>of Sophron and Xenarchus and the Socratic dialogues on the one hand; and, 
<A NAME="37"></A>on the other, to poetic imitations in iambic, elegiac, or any similar meter. 
<A NAME="38"></A>People do, indeed, add the word 'maker' or 'poet' to the name of the meter, 
<A NAME="39"></A>and speak of elegiac poets, or epic (that is, hexameter) poets, as if it 
<A NAME="40"></A>were not the imitation that makes the poet, but the verse that entitles 
<A NAME="41"></A>them all to the name. Even when a treatise on medicine or natural science 
<A NAME="42"></A>is brought out in verse, the name of poet is by custom given to the author; 
<A NAME="43"></A>and yet Homer and Empedocles have nothing in common but the meter, so that 
<A NAME="44"></A>it would be right to call the one poet, the other physicist rather than 
<A NAME="45"></A>poet. On the same principle, even if a writer in his poetic imitation were 
<A NAME="46"></A>to combine all meters, as Chaeremon did in his Centaur, which is a medley 
<A NAME="47"></A>composed of meters of all kinds, we should bring him too under the general 
<A NAME="48"></A>term poet.
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>So much then for these distinctions.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR>There are, again, some arts which employ all the means above mentioned- 
<A NAME="51"></A>namely, rhythm, tune, and meter. Such are Dithyrambic and Nomic poetry, 
<A NAME="52"></A>and also Tragedy and Comedy; but between them originally the difference 
<A NAME="53"></A>is, that in the first two cases these means are all employed in combination, 
<A NAME="54"></A>in the latter, now one means is employed, now another.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>Such, then, are the differences of the arts with respect to the 
<A NAME="56"></A>medium of imitation
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="57"></A><B>Part II</B>

<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>Since the objects of imitation are men in action, and these men 
<A NAME="59"></A>must be either of a higher or a lower type (for moral character mainly 
<A NAME="60"></A>answers to these divisions, goodness and badness being the distinguishing 
<A NAME="61"></A>marks of moral differences), it follows that we must represent men either 
<A NAME="62"></A>as better than in real life, or as worse, or as they are. It is the same 
<A NAME="63"></A>in painting. Polygnotus depicted men as nobler than they are, Pauson as 
<A NAME="64"></A>less noble, Dionysius drew them true to life.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>Now it is evident that each of the modes of imitation above mentioned 
<A NAME="66"></A>will exhibit these differences, and become a distinct kind in imitating 
<A NAME="67"></A>objects that are thus distinct. Such diversities may be found even in dancing, 
<A NAME="68"></A>flute-playing, and lyre-playing. So again in language, whether prose or 
<A NAME="69"></A>verse unaccompanied by music. Homer, for example, makes men better than 
<A NAME="70"></A>they are; Cleophon as they are; Hegemon the Thasian, the inventor of parodies, 
<A NAME="71"></A>and Nicochares, the author of the Deiliad, worse than they are. The same 
<A NAME="72"></A>thing holds good of Dithyrambs and Nomes; here too one may portray different 
<A NAME="73"></A>types, as Timotheus and Philoxenus differed in representing their Cyclopes. 
<A NAME="74"></A>The same distinction marks off Tragedy from Comedy; for Comedy aims at 
<A NAME="75"></A>representing men as worse, Tragedy as better than in actual 
<A NAME="76"></A>life.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="77"></A><B>Part III</B>

<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>There is still a third difference- the manner in which each of 
<A NAME="79"></A>these objects may be imitated. For the medium being the same, and the objects 
<A NAME="80"></A>the same, the poet may imitate by narration- in which case he can either 
<A NAME="81"></A>take another personality as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged- 
<A NAME="82"></A>or he may present all his characters as living and moving before 
<A NAME="83"></A>us.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>These, then, as we said at the beginning, are the three differences 
<A NAME="85"></A>which distinguish artistic imitation- the medium, the objects, and the 
<A NAME="86"></A>manner. So that from one point of view, Sophocles is an imitator of the 
<A NAME="87"></A>same kind as Homer- for both imitate higher types of character; from another 
<A NAME="88"></A>point of view, of the same kind as Aristophanes- for both imitate persons 
<A NAME="89"></A>acting and doing. Hence, some say, the name of 'drama' is given to such 
<A NAME="90"></A>poems, as representing action. For the same reason the Dorians claim the 
<A NAME="91"></A>invention both of Tragedy and Comedy. The claim to Comedy is put forward 
<A NAME="92"></A>by the Megarians- not only by those of Greece proper, who allege that it 
<A NAME="93"></A>originated under their democracy, but also by the Megarians of Sicily, 
<A NAME="94"></A>for the poet Epicharmus, who is much earlier than Chionides and Magnes, 
<A NAME="95"></A>belonged to that country. Tragedy too is claimed by certain Dorians of 
<A NAME="96"></A>the Peloponnese. In each case they appeal to the evidence of language. 
<A NAME="97"></A>The outlying villages, they say, are by them called komai, by the Athenians 
<A NAME="98"></A>demoi: and they assume that comedians were so named not from komazein, 
<A NAME="99"></A>'to revel,' but because they wandered from village to village (kata komas), 
<A NAME="100"></A>being excluded contemptuously from the city. They add also that the Dorian 
<A NAME="101"></A>word for 'doing' is dran, and the Athenian, prattein.
<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>This may suffice as to the number and nature of the various modes 
<A NAME="103"></A>of imitation.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="104"></A><B>Part IV</B>

<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>Poetry in general seems to have sprung from two causes, each of 
<A NAME="106"></A>them lying deep in our nature. First, the instinct of imitation is implanted 
<A NAME="107"></A>in man from childhood, one difference between him and other animals being 
<A NAME="108"></A>that he is the most imitative of living creatures, and through imitation 
<A NAME="109"></A>learns his earliest lessons; and no less universal is the pleasure felt 
<A NAME="110"></A>in things imitated. We have evidence of this in the facts of experience. 
<A NAME="111"></A>Objects which in themselves we view with pain, we delight to contemplate 
<A NAME="112"></A>when reproduced with minute fidelity: such as the forms of the most ignoble 
<A NAME="113"></A>animals and of dead bodies. The cause of this again is, that to learn gives 
<A NAME="114"></A>the liveliest pleasure, not only to philosophers but to men in general; 
<A NAME="115"></A>whose capacity, however, of learning is more limited. Thus the reason why 
<A NAME="116"></A>men enjoy seeing a likeness is, that in contemplating it they find themselves 
<A NAME="117"></A>learning or inferring, and saying perhaps, 'Ah, that is he.' For if you 
<A NAME="118"></A>happen not to have seen the original, the pleasure will be due not to the 
<A NAME="119"></A>imitation as such, but to the execution, the coloring, or some such other 
<A NAME="120"></A>cause.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is 
<A NAME="122"></A>the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections 
<A NAME="123"></A>of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed 
<A NAME="124"></A>by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave 
<A NAME="125"></A>birth to Poetry.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>Poetry now diverged in two directions, according to the individual 
<A NAME="127"></A>character of the writers. The graver spirits imitated noble actions, and 
<A NAME="128"></A>the actions of good men. The more trivial sort imitated the actions of 
<A NAME="129"></A>meaner persons, at first composing satires, as the former did hymns to 
<A NAME="130"></A>the gods and the praises of famous men. A poem of the satirical kind cannot 
<A NAME="131"></A>indeed be put down to any author earlier than Homer; though many such writers 
<A NAME="132"></A>probably there were. But from Homer onward, instances can be cited- his 
<A NAME="133"></A>own Margites, for example, and other similar compositions. The appropriate 
<A NAME="134"></A>meter was also here introduced; hence the measure is still called the iambic 
<A NAME="135"></A>or lampooning measure, being that in which people lampooned one another. 
<A NAME="136"></A>Thus the older poets were distinguished as writers of heroic or of lampooning 
<A NAME="137"></A>verse.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>As, in the serious style, Homer is pre-eminent among poets, for 
<A NAME="139"></A>he alone combined dramatic form with excellence of imitation so he too 
<A NAME="140"></A>first laid down the main lines of comedy, by dramatizing the ludicrous 
<A NAME="141"></A>instead of writing personal satire. His Margites bears the same relation 
<A NAME="142"></A>to comedy that the Iliad and Odyssey do to tragedy. But when Tragedy and 
<A NAME="143"></A>Comedy came to light, the two classes of poets still followed their natural 
<A NAME="144"></A>bent: the lampooners became writers of Comedy, and the Epic poets were 
<A NAME="145"></A>succeeded by Tragedians, since the drama was a larger and higher form of 
<A NAME="146"></A>art.
<A NAME="147"></A><BR><BR>Whether Tragedy has as yet perfected its proper types or not; and 
<A NAME="148"></A>whether it is to be judged in itself, or in relation also to the audience- 
<A NAME="149"></A>this raises another question. Be that as it may, Tragedy- as also Comedy- 
<A NAME="150"></A>was at first mere improvisation. The one originated with the authors of 
<A NAME="151"></A>the Dithyramb, the other with those of the phallic songs, which are still 
<A NAME="152"></A>in use in many of our cities. Tragedy advanced by slow degrees; each new 
<A NAME="153"></A>element that showed itself was in turn developed. Having passed through 
<A NAME="154"></A>many changes, it found its natural form, and there it 
<A NAME="155"></A>stopped.
<A NAME="156"></A><BR><BR>Aeschylus first introduced a second actor; he diminished the importance 
<A NAME="157"></A>of the Chorus, and assigned the leading part to the dialogue.  Sophocles 
<A NAME="158"></A>raised the number of actors to three, and added scene-painting. Moreover, 
<A NAME="159"></A>it was not till late that the short plot was discarded for one of greater 
<A NAME="160"></A>compass, and the grotesque diction of the earlier satyric form for the 
<A NAME="161"></A>stately manner of Tragedy. The iambic measure then replaced the trochaic 
<A NAME="162"></A>tetrameter, which was originally employed when the poetry was of the satyric 
<A NAME="163"></A>order, and had greater with dancing. Once dialogue had come in, Nature 
<A NAME="164"></A>herself discovered the appropriate measure. For the iambic is, of all measures, 
<A NAME="165"></A>the most colloquial we see it in the fact that conversational speech runs 
<A NAME="166"></A>into iambic lines more frequently than into any other kind of verse; rarely 
<A NAME="167"></A>into hexameters, and only when we drop the colloquial intonation. The additions 
<A NAME="168"></A>to the number of 'episodes' or acts, and the other accessories of which 
<A NAME="169"></A>tradition tells, must be taken as already described; for to discuss them 
<A NAME="170"></A>in detail would, doubtless, be a large undertaking.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="171"></A><B>Part V</B>

<A NAME="172"></A><BR><BR>Comedy is, as we have said, an imitation of characters of a lower 
<A NAME="173"></A>type- not, however, in the full sense of the word bad, the ludicrous being 
<A NAME="174"></A>merely a subdivision of the ugly. It consists in some defect or ugliness 
<A NAME="175"></A>which is not painful or destructive. To take an obvious example, the comic 
<A NAME="176"></A>mask is ugly and distorted, but does not imply pain.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>The successive changes through which Tragedy passed, and the authors 
<A NAME="178"></A>of these changes, are well known, whereas Comedy has had no history, because 
<A NAME="179"></A>it was not at first treated seriously. It was late before the Archon granted 
<A NAME="180"></A>a comic chorus to a poet; the performers were till then voluntary. Comedy 
<A NAME="181"></A>had already taken definite shape when comic poets, distinctively so called, 
<A NAME="182"></A>are heard of. Who furnished it with masks, or prologues, or increased the 
<A NAME="183"></A>number of actors- these and other similar details remain unknown. As for 
<A NAME="184"></A>the plot, it came originally from Sicily; but of Athenian writers Crates 
<A NAME="185"></A>was the first who abandoning the 'iambic' or lampooning form, generalized 
<A NAME="186"></A>his themes and plots.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>Epic poetry agrees with Tragedy in so far as it is an imitation 
<A NAME="188"></A>in verse of characters of a higher type. They differ in that Epic poetry 
<A NAME="189"></A>admits but one kind of meter and is narrative in form. They differ, again, 
<A NAME="190"></A>in their length: for Tragedy endeavors, as far as possible, to confine 
<A NAME="191"></A>itself to a single revolution of the sun, or but slightly to exceed this 
<A NAME="192"></A>limit, whereas the Epic action has no limits of time. This, then, is a 
<A NAME="193"></A>second point of difference; though at first the same freedom was admitted 
<A NAME="194"></A>in Tragedy as in Epic poetry.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>Of their constituent parts some are common to both, some peculiar 
<A NAME="196"></A>to Tragedy: whoever, therefore knows what is good or bad Tragedy, knows 
<A NAME="197"></A>also about Epic poetry. All the elements of an Epic poem are found in Tragedy, 
<A NAME="198"></A>but the elements of a Tragedy are not all found in the Epic 
<A NAME="199"></A>poem.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="200"></A><B>Part VI</B>

<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>Of the poetry which imitates in hexameter verse, and of Comedy, 
<A NAME="202"></A>we will speak hereafter. Let us now discuss Tragedy, resuming its formal 
<A NAME="203"></A>definition, as resulting from what has been already 
<A NAME="204"></A>said.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>Tragedy, then, is an imitation of an action that is serious, complete, 
<A NAME="206"></A>and of a certain magnitude; in language embellished with each kind of artistic 
<A NAME="207"></A>ornament, the several kinds being found in separate parts of the play; 
<A NAME="208"></A>in the form of action, not of narrative; through pity and fear effecting 
<A NAME="209"></A>the proper purgation of these emotions. By 'language embellished,' I mean 
<A NAME="210"></A>language into which rhythm, 'harmony' and song enter. By 'the several kinds 
<A NAME="211"></A>in separate parts,' I mean, that some parts are rendered through the medium 
<A NAME="212"></A>of verse alone, others again with the aid of song.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>Now as tragic imitation implies persons acting, it necessarily 
<A NAME="214"></A>follows in the first place, that Spectacular equipment will be a part of 
<A NAME="215"></A>Tragedy. Next, Song and Diction, for these are the media of imitation. 
<A NAME="216"></A>By 'Diction' I mean the mere metrical arrangement of the words: as for 
<A NAME="217"></A>'Song,' it is a term whose sense every one understands.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>Again, Tragedy is the imitation of an action; and an action implies 
<A NAME="219"></A>personal agents, who necessarily possess certain distinctive qualities 
<A NAME="220"></A>both of character and thought; for it is by these that we qualify actions 
<A NAME="221"></A>themselves, and these- thought and character- are the two natural causes 
<A NAME="222"></A>from which actions spring, and on actions again all success or failure 
<A NAME="223"></A>depends. Hence, the Plot is the imitation of the action- for by plot I 
<A NAME="224"></A>here mean the arrangement of the incidents. By Character I mean that in 
<A NAME="225"></A>virtue of which we ascribe certain qualities to the agents. Thought is 
<A NAME="226"></A>required wherever a statement is proved, or, it may be, a general truth 
<A NAME="227"></A>enunciated. Every Tragedy, therefore, must have six parts, which parts 
<A NAME="228"></A>determine its quality- namely, Plot, Character, Diction, Thought, Spectacle, 
<A NAME="229"></A>Song. Two of the parts constitute the medium of imitation, one the manner, 
<A NAME="230"></A>and three the objects of imitation. And these complete the fist. These 
<A NAME="231"></A>elements have been employed, we may say, by the poets to a man; in fact, 
<A NAME="232"></A>every play contains Spectacular elements as well as Character, Plot, Diction, 
<A NAME="233"></A>Song, and Thought.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>But most important of all is the structure of the incidents. For 
<A NAME="235"></A>Tragedy is an imitation, not of men, but of an action and of life, and 
<A NAME="236"></A>life consists in action, and its end is a mode of action, not a quality. 
<A NAME="237"></A>Now character determines men's qualities, but it is by their actions that 
<A NAME="238"></A>they are happy or the reverse. Dramatic action, therefore, is not with 
<A NAME="239"></A>a view to the representation of character: character comes in as subsidiary 
<A NAME="240"></A>to the actions. Hence the incidents and the plot are the end of a tragedy; 
<A NAME="241"></A>and the end is the chief thing of all. Again, without action there cannot 
<A NAME="242"></A>be a tragedy; there may be without character. The tragedies of most of 
<A NAME="243"></A>our modern poets fail in the rendering of character; and of poets in general 
<A NAME="244"></A>this is often true. It is the same in painting; and here lies the difference 
<A NAME="245"></A>between Zeuxis and Polygnotus. Polygnotus delineates character well; the 
<A NAME="246"></A>style of Zeuxis is devoid of ethical quality. Again, if you string together 
<A NAME="247"></A>a set of speeches expressive of character, and well finished in point of 
<A NAME="248"></A>diction and thought, you will not produce the essential tragic effect nearly 
<A NAME="249"></A>so well as with a play which, however deficient in these respects, yet 
<A NAME="250"></A>has a plot and artistically constructed incidents. Besides which, the most 
<A NAME="251"></A>powerful elements of emotional interest in Tragedy- Peripeteia or Reversal 
<A NAME="252"></A>of the Situation, and Recognition scenes- are parts of the plot. A further 
<A NAME="253"></A>proof is, that novices in the art attain to finish of diction and precision 
<A NAME="254"></A>of portraiture before they can construct the plot. It is the same with 
<A NAME="255"></A>almost all the early poets.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>The plot, then, is the first principle, and, as it were, the soul 
<A NAME="257"></A>of a tragedy; Character holds the second place. A similar fact is seen 
<A NAME="258"></A>in painting. The most beautiful colors, laid on confusedly, will not give 
<A NAME="259"></A>as much pleasure as the chalk outline of a portrait. Thus Tragedy is the 
<A NAME="260"></A>imitation of an action, and of the agents mainly with a view to the 
<A NAME="261"></A>action.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>Third in order is Thought- that is, the faculty of saying what 
<A NAME="263"></A>is possible and pertinent in given circumstances. In the case of oratory, 
<A NAME="264"></A>this is the function of the political art and of the art of rhetoric: and 
<A NAME="265"></A>so indeed the older poets make their characters speak the language of civic 
<A NAME="266"></A>life; the poets of our time, the language of the rhetoricians. Character 
<A NAME="267"></A>is that which reveals moral purpose, showing what kind of things a man 
<A NAME="268"></A>chooses or avoids. Speeches, therefore, which do not make this manifest, 
<A NAME="269"></A>or in which the speaker does not choose or avoid anything whatever, are 
<A NAME="270"></A>not expressive of character. Thought, on the other hand, is found where 
<A NAME="271"></A>something is proved to be or not to be, or a general maxim is 
<A NAME="272"></A>enunciated.
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>Fourth among the elements enumerated comes Diction; by which I 
<A NAME="274"></A>mean, as has been already said, the expression of the meaning in words; 
<A NAME="275"></A>and its essence is the same both in verse and prose.
<A NAME="276"></A><BR><BR>Of the remaining elements Song holds the chief place among the 
<A NAME="277"></A>embellishments
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>The Spectacle has, indeed, an emotional attraction of its own, 
<A NAME="279"></A>but, of all the parts, it is the least artistic, and connected least with 
<A NAME="280"></A>the art of poetry. For the power of Tragedy, we may be sure, is felt even 
<A NAME="281"></A>apart from representation and actors. Besides, the production of spectacular 
<A NAME="282"></A>effects depends more on the art of the stage machinist than on that of 
<A NAME="283"></A>the poet.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="284"></A><B>Part VII</B>

<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>These principles being established, let us now discuss the proper 
<A NAME="286"></A>structure of the Plot, since this is the first and most important thing 
<A NAME="287"></A>in Tragedy.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>Now, according to our definition Tragedy is an imitation of an 
<A NAME="289"></A>action that is complete, and whole, and of a certain magnitude; for there 
<A NAME="290"></A>may be a whole that is wanting in magnitude. A whole is that which has 
<A NAME="291"></A>a beginning, a middle, and an end. A beginning is that which does not itself 
<A NAME="292"></A>follow anything by causal necessity, but after which something naturally 
<A NAME="293"></A>is or comes to be. An end, on the contrary, is that which itself naturally 
<A NAME="294"></A>follows some other thing, either by necessity, or as a rule, but has nothing 
<A NAME="295"></A>following it. A middle is that which follows something as some other thing 
<A NAME="296"></A>follows it. A well constructed plot, therefore, must neither begin nor 
<A NAME="297"></A>end at haphazard, but conform to these principles.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>Again, a beautiful object, whether it be a living organism or any 
<A NAME="299"></A>whole composed of parts, must not only have an orderly arrangement of parts, 
<A NAME="300"></A>but must also be of a certain magnitude; for beauty depends on magnitude 
<A NAME="301"></A>and order. Hence a very small animal organism cannot be beautiful; for 
<A NAME="302"></A>the view of it is confused, the object being seen in an almost imperceptible 
<A NAME="303"></A>moment of time. Nor, again, can one of vast size be beautiful; for as the 
<A NAME="304"></A>eye cannot take it all in at once, the unity and sense of the whole is 
<A NAME="305"></A>lost for the spectator; as for instance if there were one a thousand miles 
<A NAME="306"></A>long. As, therefore, in the case of animate bodies and organisms a certain 
<A NAME="307"></A>magnitude is necessary, and a magnitude which may be easily embraced in 
<A NAME="308"></A>one view; so in the plot, a certain length is necessary, and a length which 
<A NAME="309"></A>can be easily embraced by the memory. The limit of length in relation to 
<A NAME="310"></A>dramatic competition and sensuous presentment is no part of artistic theory. 
<A NAME="311"></A>For had it been the rule for a hundred tragedies to compete together, the 
<A NAME="312"></A>performance would have been regulated by the water-clock- as indeed we 
<A NAME="313"></A>are told was formerly done. But the limit as fixed by the nature of the 
<A NAME="314"></A>drama itself is this: the greater the length, the more beautiful will the 
<A NAME="315"></A>piece be by reason of its size, provided that the whole be perspicuous. 
<A NAME="316"></A>And to define the matter roughly, we may say that the proper magnitude 
<A NAME="317"></A>is comprised within such limits, that the sequence of events, according 
<A NAME="318"></A>to the law of probability or necessity, will admit of a change from bad 
<A NAME="319"></A>fortune to good, or from good fortune to bad.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="320"></A><B>Part VIII</B>

<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>Unity of plot does not, as some persons think, consist in the unity 
<A NAME="322"></A>of the hero. For infinitely various are the incidents in one man's life 
<A NAME="323"></A>which cannot be reduced to unity; and so, too, there are many actions of 
<A NAME="324"></A>one man out of which we cannot make one action. Hence the error, as it 
<A NAME="325"></A>appears, of all poets who have composed a Heracleid, a Theseid, or other 
<A NAME="326"></A>poems of the kind. They imagine that as Heracles was one man, the story 
<A NAME="327"></A>of Heracles must also be a unity. But Homer, as in all else he is of surpassing 
<A NAME="328"></A>merit, here too- whether from art or natural genius- seems to have happily 
<A NAME="329"></A>discerned the truth. In composing the Odyssey he did not include all the 
<A NAME="330"></A>adventures of Odysseus- such as his wound on Parnassus, or his feigned 
<A NAME="331"></A>madness at the mustering of the host- incidents between which there was 
<A NAME="332"></A>no necessary or probable connection: but he made the Odyssey, and likewise 
<A NAME="333"></A>the Iliad, to center round an action that in our sense of the word is one. 
<A NAME="334"></A>As therefore, in the other imitative arts, the imitation is one when the 
<A NAME="335"></A>object imitated is one, so the plot, being an imitation of an action, must 
<A NAME="336"></A>imitate one action and that a whole, the structural union of the parts 
<A NAME="337"></A>being such that, if any one of them is displaced or removed, the whole 
<A NAME="338"></A>will be disjointed and disturbed. For a thing whose presence or absence 
<A NAME="339"></A>makes no visible difference, is not an organic part of the 
<A NAME="340"></A>whole.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="341"></A><B>Part IX</B>

<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>It is, moreover, evident from what has been said, that it is not 
<A NAME="343"></A>the function of the poet to relate what has happened, but what may happen- 
<A NAME="344"></A>what is possible according to the law of probability or necessity. The 
<A NAME="345"></A>poet and the historian differ not by writing in verse or in prose. The 
<A NAME="346"></A>work of Herodotus might be put into verse, and it would still be a species 
<A NAME="347"></A>of history, with meter no less than without it. The true difference is 
<A NAME="348"></A>that one relates what has happened, the other what may happen. Poetry, 
<A NAME="349"></A>therefore, is a more philosophical and a higher thing than history: for 
<A NAME="350"></A>poetry tends to express the universal, history the particular. By the universal 
<A NAME="351"></A>I mean how a person of a certain type on occasion speak or act, according 
<A NAME="352"></A>to the law of probability or necessity; and it is this universality at 
<A NAME="353"></A>which poetry aims in the names she attaches to the personages. The particular 
<A NAME="354"></A>is- for example- what Alcibiades did or suffered. In Comedy this is already 
<A NAME="355"></A>apparent: for here the poet first constructs the plot on the lines of probability, 
<A NAME="356"></A>and then inserts characteristic names- unlike the lampooners who write 
<A NAME="357"></A>about particular individuals. But tragedians still keep to real names, 
<A NAME="358"></A>the reason being that what is possible is credible: what has not happened 
<A NAME="359"></A>we do not at once feel sure to be possible; but what has happened is manifestly 
<A NAME="360"></A>possible: otherwise it would not have happened. Still there are even some 
<A NAME="361"></A>tragedies in which there are only one or two well-known names, the rest 
<A NAME="362"></A>being fictitious. In others, none are well known- as in Agathon's Antheus, 
<A NAME="363"></A>where incidents and names alike are fictitious, and yet they give none 
<A NAME="364"></A>the less pleasure. We must not, therefore, at all costs keep to the received 
<A NAME="365"></A>legends, which are the usual subjects of Tragedy. Indeed, it would be absurd 
<A NAME="366"></A>to attempt it; for even subjects that are known are known only to a few, 
<A NAME="367"></A>and yet give pleasure to all. It clearly follows that the poet or 'maker' 
<A NAME="368"></A>should be the maker of plots rather than of verses; since he is a poet 
<A NAME="369"></A>because he imitates, and what he imitates are actions. And even if he chances 
<A NAME="370"></A>to take a historical subject, he is none the less a poet; for there is 
<A NAME="371"></A>no reason why some events that have actually happened should not conform 
<A NAME="372"></A>to the law of the probable and possible, and in virtue of that quality 
<A NAME="373"></A>in them he is their poet or maker.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>Of all plots and actions the episodic are the worst. I call a plot 
<A NAME="375"></A>'episodic' in which the episodes or acts succeed one another without probable 
<A NAME="376"></A>or necessary sequence. Bad poets compose such pieces by their own fault, 
<A NAME="377"></A>good poets, to please the players; for, as they write show pieces for competition, 
<A NAME="378"></A>they stretch the plot beyond its capacity, and are often forced to break 
<A NAME="379"></A>the natural continuity.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>But again, Tragedy is an imitation not only of a complete action, 
<A NAME="381"></A>but of events inspiring fear or pity. Such an effect is best produced when 
<A NAME="382"></A>the events come on us by surprise; and the effect is heightened when, at 
<A NAME="383"></A>the same time, they follow as cause and effect. The tragic wonder will 
<A NAME="384"></A>then be greater than if they happened of themselves or by accident; for 
<A NAME="385"></A>even coincidences are most striking when they have an air of design. We 
<A NAME="386"></A>may instance the statue of Mitys at Argos, which fell upon his murderer 
<A NAME="387"></A>while he was a spectator at a festival, and killed him. Such events seem 
<A NAME="388"></A>not to be due to mere chance. Plots, therefore, constructed on these principles 
<A NAME="389"></A>are necessarily the best.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="390"></A><B>Part X</B>

<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>Plots are either Simple or Complex, for the actions in real life, 
<A NAME="392"></A>of which the plots are an imitation, obviously show a similar distinction. 
<A NAME="393"></A>An action which is one and continuous in the sense above defined, I call 
<A NAME="394"></A>Simple, when the change of fortune takes place without Reversal of the 
<A NAME="395"></A>Situation and without Recognition
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>A Complex action is one in which the change is accompanied by such 
<A NAME="397"></A>Reversal, or by Recognition, or by both. These last should arise from the 
<A NAME="398"></A>internal structure of the plot, so that what follows should be the necessary 
<A NAME="399"></A>or probable result of the preceding action. It makes all the difference 
<A NAME="400"></A>whether any given event is a case of propter hoc or post 
<A NAME="401"></A>hoc.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="402"></A><B>Part XI</B>

<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>Reversal of the Situation is a change by which the action veers 
<A NAME="404"></A>round to its opposite, subject always to our rule of probability or necessity. 
<A NAME="405"></A>Thus in the Oedipus, the messenger comes to cheer Oedipus and free him 
<A NAME="406"></A>from his alarms about his mother, but by revealing who he is, he produces 
<A NAME="407"></A>the opposite effect. Again in the Lynceus, Lynceus is being led away to 
<A NAME="408"></A>his death, and Danaus goes with him, meaning to slay him; but the outcome 
<A NAME="409"></A>of the preceding incidents is that Danaus is killed and Lynceus 
<A NAME="410"></A>saved.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>Recognition, as the name indicates, is a change from ignorance 
<A NAME="412"></A>to knowledge, producing love or hate between the persons destined by the 
<A NAME="413"></A>poet for good or bad fortune. The best form of recognition is coincident 
<A NAME="414"></A>with a Reversal of the Situation, as in the Oedipus. There are indeed other 
<A NAME="415"></A>forms. Even inanimate things of the most trivial kind may in a sense be 
<A NAME="416"></A>objects of recognition. Again, we may recognize or discover whether a person 
<A NAME="417"></A>has done  a thing or not. But the recognition which is most intimately 
<A NAME="418"></A>connected with the plot and action is, as we have said, the recognition 
<A NAME="419"></A>of persons. This recognition, combined with Reversal, will produce either 
<A NAME="420"></A>pity or fear; and actions producing these effects are those which, by our 
<A NAME="421"></A>definition, Tragedy represents. Moreover, it is upon such situations that 
<A NAME="422"></A>the issues of good or bad fortune will depend. Recognition, then, being 
<A NAME="423"></A>between persons, it may happen that one person only is recognized by the 
<A NAME="424"></A>other- when the latter is already known- or it may be necessary that the 
<A NAME="425"></A>recognition should be on both sides. Thus Iphigenia is revealed to Orestes 
<A NAME="426"></A>by the sending of the letter; but another act of recognition is required 
<A NAME="427"></A>to make Orestes known to Iphigenia.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>Two parts, then, of the Plot- Reversal of the Situation and Recognition- 
<A NAME="429"></A>turn upon surprises. A third part is the Scene of Suffering. The Scene 
<A NAME="430"></A>of Suffering is a destructive or painful action, such as death on the stage, 
<A NAME="431"></A>bodily agony, wounds, and the like.
