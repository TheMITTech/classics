<A NAME="10"></A>1
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Since we have previously said that one ought to choose that which 
<A NAME="12"></A>is intermediate, not the excess nor the defect, and that the intermediate 
<A NAME="13"></A>is determined by the dictates of the right rule, let us discuss the nature 
<A NAME="14"></A>of these dictates. In all the states of character we have mentioned, as 
<A NAME="15"></A>in all other matters, there is a mark to which the man who has the rule 
<A NAME="16"></A>looks, and heightens or relaxes his activity accordingly, and there is 
<A NAME="17"></A>a standard which determines the mean states which we say are intermediate 
<A NAME="18"></A>between excess and defect, being in accordance with the right rule. But 
<A NAME="19"></A>such a statement, though true, is by no means clear; for not only here 
<A NAME="20"></A>but in all other pursuits which are objects of knowledge it is indeed true 
<A NAME="21"></A>to say that we must not exert ourselves nor relax our efforts too much 
<A NAME="22"></A>nor too little, but to an intermediate extent and as the right rule dictates; 
<A NAME="23"></A>but if a man had only this knowledge he would be none the wiser e.g. we 
<A NAME="24"></A>should not know what sort of medicines to apply to our body if some one 
<A NAME="25"></A>were to say 'all those which the medical art prescribes, and which agree 
<A NAME="26"></A>with the practice of one who possesses the art'. Hence it is necessary 
<A NAME="27"></A>with regard to the states of the soul also not only that this true statement 
<A NAME="28"></A>should be made, but also that it should be determined what is the right 
<A NAME="29"></A>rule and what is the standard that fixes it.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>We divided the virtues of the soul and a said that some are virtues 
<A NAME="31"></A>of character and others of intellect. Now we have discussed in detail the 
<A NAME="32"></A>moral virtues; with regard to the others let us express our view as follows, 
<A NAME="33"></A>beginning with some remarks about the soul. We said before that there are 
<A NAME="34"></A>two parts of the soul-that which grasps a rule or rational principle, and 
<A NAME="35"></A>the irrational; let us now draw a similar distinction within the part which 
<A NAME="36"></A>grasps a rational principle. And let it be assumed that there are two parts 
<A NAME="37"></A>which grasp a rational principle-one by which we contemplate the kind of 
<A NAME="38"></A>things whose originative causes are invariable, and one by which we contemplate 
<A NAME="39"></A>variable things; for where objects differ in kind the part of the soul 
<A NAME="40"></A>answering to each of the two is different in kind, since it is in virtue 
<A NAME="41"></A>of a certain likeness and kinship with their objects that they have the 
<A NAME="42"></A>knowledge they have. Let one of these parts be called the scientific and 
<A NAME="43"></A>the other the calculative; for to deliberate and to calculate are the same 
<A NAME="44"></A>thing, but no one deliberates about the invariable. Therefore the calculative 
<A NAME="45"></A>is one part of the faculty which grasps a rational principle. We must, 
<A NAME="46"></A>then, learn what is the best state of each of these two parts; for this 
<A NAME="47"></A>is the virtue of each.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>2
<A NAME="49"></A><BR><BR>The virtue of a thing is relative to its proper work. Now there 
<A NAME="50"></A>are three things in the soul which control action and truth-sensation, 
<A NAME="51"></A>reason, desire.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>Of these sensation originates no action; this is plain from the 
<A NAME="53"></A>fact that the lower animals have sensation but no share in 
<A NAME="54"></A>action.
<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>What affirmation and negation are in thinking, pursuit and avoidance 
<A NAME="56"></A>are in desire; so that since moral virtue is a state of character concerned 
<A NAME="57"></A>with choice, and choice is deliberate desire, therefore both the reasoning 
<A NAME="58"></A>must be true and the desire right, if the choice is to be good, and the 
<A NAME="59"></A>latter must pursue just what the former asserts. Now this kind of intellect 
<A NAME="60"></A>and of truth is practical; of the intellect which is contemplative, not 
<A NAME="61"></A>practical nor productive, the good and the bad state are truth and falsity 
<A NAME="62"></A>respectively (for this is the work of everything intellectual); while of 
<A NAME="63"></A>the part which is practical and intellectual the good state is truth in 
<A NAME="64"></A>agreement with right desire.
<A NAME="65"></A><BR><BR>The origin of action-its efficient, not its final cause-is choice, 
<A NAME="66"></A>and that of choice is desire and reasoning with a view to an end. This 
<A NAME="67"></A>is why choice cannot exist either without reason and intellect or without 
<A NAME="68"></A>a moral state; for good action and its opposite cannot exist without a 
<A NAME="69"></A>combination of intellect and character. Intellect itself, however, moves 
<A NAME="70"></A>nothing, but only the intellect which aims at an end and is practical; 
<A NAME="71"></A>for this rules the productive intellect, as well, since every one who makes 
<A NAME="72"></A>makes for an end, and that which is made is not an end in the unqualified 
<A NAME="73"></A>sense (but only an end in a particular relation, and the end of a particular 
<A NAME="74"></A>operation)-only that which is done is that; for good action is an end, 
<A NAME="75"></A>and desire aims at this. Hence choice is either desiderative reason or 
<A NAME="76"></A>ratiocinative desire, and such an origin of action is a man. (It is to 
<A NAME="77"></A>be noted that nothing that is past is an object of choice, e.g. no one 
<A NAME="78"></A>chooses to have sacked Troy; for no one deliberates about the past, but 
<A NAME="79"></A>about what is future and capable of being otherwise, while what is past 
<A NAME="80"></A>is not capable of not having taken place; hence Agathon is right in 
<A NAME="81"></A>saying
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>For this alone is lacking even to God,
<A NAME="83"></A><BR>To make undone things thathave once been done.)
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>The work of both the intellectual parts, then, is truth. Therefore 
<A NAME="85"></A>the states that are most strictly those in respect of which each of these 
<A NAME="86"></A>parts will reach truth are the virtues of the two parts.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>3
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>Let us begin, then, from the beginning, and discuss these states 
<A NAME="89"></A>once more. Let it be assumed that the states by virtue of which the soul 
<A NAME="90"></A>possesses truth by way of affirmation or denial are five in number, i.e. 
<A NAME="91"></A>art, scientific knowledge, practical wisdom, philosophic wisdom, intuitive 
<A NAME="92"></A>reason; we do not include judgement and opinion because in these we may 
<A NAME="93"></A>be mistaken.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>Now what scientific knowledge is, if we are to speak exactly and 
<A NAME="95"></A>not follow mere similarities, is plain from what follows. We all suppose 
<A NAME="96"></A>that what we know is not even capable of being otherwise; of things capable 
<A NAME="97"></A>of being otherwise we do not know, when they have passed outside our observation, 
<A NAME="98"></A>whether they exist or not. Therefore the object of scientific knowledge 
<A NAME="99"></A>is of necessity. Therefore it is eternal; for things that are of necessity 
<A NAME="100"></A>in the unqualified sense are all eternal; and things that are eternal are 
<A NAME="101"></A>ungenerated and imperishable. Again, every science is thought to be capable 
<A NAME="102"></A>of being taught, and its object of being learned. And all teaching starts 
<A NAME="103"></A>from what is already known, as we maintain in the Analytics also; for it 
<A NAME="104"></A>proceeds sometimes through induction and sometimes by syllogism. Now induction 
<A NAME="105"></A>is the starting-point which knowledge even of the universal presupposes, 
<A NAME="106"></A>while syllogism proceeds from universals. There are therefore starting-points 
<A NAME="107"></A>from which syllogism proceeds, which are not reached by syllogism; it is 
<A NAME="108"></A>therefore by induction that they are acquired. Scientific knowledge is, 
<A NAME="109"></A>then, a state of capacity to demonstrate, and has the other limiting characteristics 
<A NAME="110"></A>which we specify in the Analytics, for it is when a man believes in a certain 
<A NAME="111"></A>way and the starting-points are known to him that he has scientific knowledge, 
<A NAME="112"></A>since if they are not better known to him than the conclusion, he will 
<A NAME="113"></A>have his knowledge only incidentally.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>Let this, then, be taken as our account of scientific 
<A NAME="115"></A>knowledge.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR>4
<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>In the variable are included both things made and things done; 
<A NAME="118"></A>making and acting are different (for their nature we treat even the discussions 
<A NAME="119"></A>outside our school as reliable); so that the reasoned state of capacity 
<A NAME="120"></A>to act is different from the reasoned state of capacity to make. Hence 
<A NAME="121"></A>too they are not included one in the other; for neither is acting making 
<A NAME="122"></A>nor is making acting. Now since architecture is an art and is essentially 
<A NAME="123"></A>a reasoned state of capacity to make, and there is neither any art that 
<A NAME="124"></A>is not such a state nor any such state that is not an art, art is identical 
<A NAME="125"></A>with a state of capacity to make, involving a true course of reasoning. 
<A NAME="126"></A>All art is concerned with coming into being, i.e. with contriving and considering 
<A NAME="127"></A>how something may come into being which is capable of either being or not 
<A NAME="128"></A>being, and whose origin is in the maker and not in the thing made; for 
<A NAME="129"></A>art is concerned neither with things that are, or come into being, by necessity, 
<A NAME="130"></A>nor with things that do so in accordance with nature (since these have 
<A NAME="131"></A>their origin in themselves). Making and acting being different, art must 
<A NAME="132"></A>be a matter of making, not of acting. And in a sense chance and art are 
<A NAME="133"></A>concerned with the same objects; as Agathon says, 'art loves chance and 
<A NAME="134"></A>chance loves art'. Art, then, as has been is a state concerned with making, 
<A NAME="135"></A>involving a true course of reasoning, and lack of art on the contrary is 
<A NAME="136"></A>a state concerned with making, involving a false course of reasoning; both 
<A NAME="137"></A>are concerned with the variable.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>5
<A NAME="139"></A><BR><BR>Regarding practical wisdom we shall get at the truth by considering 
<A NAME="140"></A>who are the persons we credit with it. Now it is thought to be the mark 
<A NAME="141"></A>of a man of practical wisdom to be able to deliberate well about what is 
<A NAME="142"></A>good and expedient for himself, not in some particular respect, e.g. about 
<A NAME="143"></A>what sorts of thing conduce to health or to strength, but about what sorts 
<A NAME="144"></A>of thing conduce to the good life in general. This is shown by the fact 
<A NAME="145"></A>that we credit men with practical wisdom in some particular respect when 
<A NAME="146"></A>they have calculated well with a view to some good end which is one of 
<A NAME="147"></A>those that are not the object of any art. It follows that in the general 
<A NAME="148"></A>sense also the man who is capable of deliberating has practical wisdom. 
<A NAME="149"></A>Now no one deliberates about things that are invariable, nor about things 
<A NAME="150"></A>that it is impossible for him to do. Therefore, since scientific knowledge 
<A NAME="151"></A>involves demonstration, but there is no demonstration of things whose first 
<A NAME="152"></A>principles are variable (for all such things might actually be otherwise), 
<A NAME="153"></A>and since it is impossible to deliberate about things that are of necessity, 
<A NAME="154"></A>practical wisdom cannot be scientific knowledge nor art; not science because 
<A NAME="155"></A>that which can be done is capable of being otherwise, not art because action 
<A NAME="156"></A>and making are different kinds of thing. The remaining alternative, then, 
<A NAME="157"></A>is that it is a true and reasoned state of capacity to act with regard 
<A NAME="158"></A>to the things that are good or bad for man. For while making has an end 
<A NAME="159"></A>other than itself, action cannot; for good action itself is its end. It 
<A NAME="160"></A>is for this reason that we think Pericles and men like him have practical 
<A NAME="161"></A>wisdom, viz. because they can see what is good for themselves and what 
<A NAME="162"></A>is good for men in general; we consider that those can do this who are 
<A NAME="163"></A>good at managing households or states. (This is why we call temperance 
<A NAME="164"></A>(sophrosune) by this name; we imply that it preserves one's practical wisdom 
<A NAME="165"></A>(sozousa tan phronsin). Now what it preserves is a judgement of the kind 
<A NAME="166"></A>we have described. For it is not any and every judgement that pleasant 
<A NAME="167"></A>and painful objects destroy and pervert, e.g. the judgement that the triangle 
<A NAME="168"></A>has or has not its angles equal to two right angles, but only judgements 
<A NAME="169"></A>about what is to be done. For the originating causes of the things that 
<A NAME="170"></A>are done consist in the end at which they are aimed; but the man who has 
<A NAME="171"></A>been ruined by pleasure or pain forthwith fails to see any such originating 
<A NAME="172"></A>cause-to see that for the sake of this or because of this he ought to choose 
<A NAME="173"></A>and do whatever he chooses and does; for vice is destructive of the originating 
<A NAME="174"></A>cause of action.) Practical wisdom, then, must be a reasoned and true state 
<A NAME="175"></A>of capacity to act with regard to human goods. But further, while there 
<A NAME="176"></A>is such a thing as excellence in art, there is no such thing as excellence 
<A NAME="177"></A>in practical wisdom; and in art he who errs willingly is preferable, but 
<A NAME="178"></A>in practical wisdom, as in the virtues, he is the reverse. Plainly, then, 
<A NAME="179"></A>practical wisdom is a virtue and not an art. There being two parts of the 
<A NAME="180"></A>soul that can follow a course of reasoning, it must be the virtue of one 
<A NAME="181"></A>of the two, i.e. of that part which forms opinions; for opinion is about 
<A NAME="182"></A>the variable and so is practical wisdom. But yet it is not only a reasoned 
<A NAME="183"></A>state; this is shown by the fact that a state of that sort may forgotten 
<A NAME="184"></A>but practical wisdom cannot.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>6
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>Scientific knowledge is judgement about things that are universal 
<A NAME="187"></A>and necessary, and the conclusions of demonstration, and all scientific 
<A NAME="188"></A>knowledge, follow from first principles (for scientific knowledge involves 
<A NAME="189"></A>apprehension of a rational ground). This being so, the first principle 
<A NAME="190"></A>from which what is scientifically known follows cannot be an object of 
<A NAME="191"></A>scientific knowledge, of art, or of practical wisdom; for that which can 
<A NAME="192"></A>be scientifically known can be demonstrated, and art and practical wisdom 
<A NAME="193"></A>deal with things that are variable. Nor are these first principles the 
<A NAME="194"></A>objects of philosophic wisdom, for it is a mark of the philosopher to have 
<A NAME="195"></A>demonstration about some things. If, then, the states of mind by which 
<A NAME="196"></A>we have truth and are never deceived about things invariable or even variable 
<A NAME="197"></A>are scientific knowlededge, practical wisdom, philosophic wisdom, and intuitive 
<A NAME="198"></A>reason, and it cannot be any of the three (i.e. practical wisdom, scientific 
<A NAME="199"></A>knowledge, or philosophic wisdom), the remaining alternative is that it 
<A NAME="200"></A>is intuitive reason that grasps the first principles.
<A NAME="201"></A><BR><BR>7
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>Wisdom (1) in the arts we ascribe to their most finished exponents, 
<A NAME="203"></A>e.g. to Phidias as a sculptor and to Polyclitus as a maker of portrait-statues, 
<A NAME="204"></A>and here we mean nothing by wisdom except excellence in art; but (2) we 
<A NAME="205"></A>think that some people are wise in general, not in some particular field 
<A NAME="206"></A>or in any other limited respect, as Homer says in the 
<A NAME="207"></A>Margites,
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>Him did the gods make neither a digger nor yet a 
<A NAME="209"></A>ploughman
<A NAME="210"></A><BR>Nor wise in anything else. Therefore wisdom must plainly be the most 
<A NAME="211"></A>finished of the forms of knowledge. It follows that the wise man must not 
<A NAME="212"></A>only know what follows from the first principles, but must also possess 
<A NAME="213"></A>truth about the first principles. Therefore wisdom must be intuitive reason 
<A NAME="214"></A>combined with scientific knowledge-scientific knowledge of the highest 
<A NAME="215"></A>objects which has received as it were its proper completion.
<A NAME="216"></A><BR><BR>Of the highest objects, we say; for it would be strange to think 
<A NAME="217"></A>that the art of politics, or practical wisdom, is the best knowledge, since 
<A NAME="218"></A>man is not the best thing in the world. Now if what is healthy or good 
<A NAME="219"></A>is different for men and for fishes, but what is white or straight is always 
<A NAME="220"></A>the same, any one would say that what is wise is the same but what is practically 
<A NAME="221"></A>wise is different; for it is to that which observes well the various matters 
<A NAME="222"></A>concerning itself that one ascribes practical wisdom, and it is to this 
<A NAME="223"></A>that one will entrust such matters. This is why we say that some even of 
<A NAME="224"></A>the lower animals have practical wisdom, viz. those which are found to 
<A NAME="225"></A>have a power of foresight with regard to their own life. It is evident 
<A NAME="226"></A>also that philosophic wisdom and the art of politics cannot be the same; 
<A NAME="227"></A>for if the state of mind concerned with a man's own interests is to be 
<A NAME="228"></A>called philosophic wisdom, there will be many philosophic wisdoms; there 
<A NAME="229"></A>will not be one concerned with the good of all animals (any more than there 
<A NAME="230"></A>is one art of medicine for all existing things), but a different philosophic 
<A NAME="231"></A>wisdom about the good of each species.
<A NAME="232"></A><BR><BR>But if the argument be that man is the best of the animals, this 
<A NAME="233"></A>makes no difference; for there are other things much more divine in their 
<A NAME="234"></A>nature even than man, e.g., most conspicuously, the bodies of which the 
<A NAME="235"></A>heavens are framed. From what has been said it is plain, then, that philosophic 
<A NAME="236"></A>wisdom is scientific knowledge, combined with intuitive reason, of the 
<A NAME="237"></A>things that are highest by nature. This is why we say Anaxagoras, Thales, 
<A NAME="238"></A>and men like them have philosophic but not practical wisdom, when we see 
<A NAME="239"></A>them ignorant of what is to their own advantage, and why we say that they 
<A NAME="240"></A>know things that are remarkable, admirable, difficult, and divine, but 
<A NAME="241"></A>useless; viz. because it is not human goods that they 
<A NAME="242"></A>seek.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>Practical wisdom on the other hand is concerned with things human 
<A NAME="244"></A>and things about which it is possible to deliberate; for we say this is 
<A NAME="245"></A>above all the work of the man of practical wisdom, to deliberate well, 
<A NAME="246"></A>but no one deliberates about things invariable, nor about things which 
<A NAME="247"></A>have not an end, and that a good that can be brought about by action. The 
<A NAME="248"></A>man who is without qualification good at deliberating is the man who is 
<A NAME="249"></A>capable of aiming in accordance with calculation at the best for man of 
<A NAME="250"></A>things attainable by action. Nor is practical wisdom concerned with universals 
<A NAME="251"></A>only-it must also recognize the particulars; for it is practical, and practice 
<A NAME="252"></A>is concerned with particulars. This is why some who do not know, and especially 
<A NAME="253"></A>those who have experience, are more practical than others who know; for 
<A NAME="254"></A>if a man knew that light meats are digestible and wholesome, but did not 
<A NAME="255"></A>know which sorts of meat are light, he would not produce health, but the 
<A NAME="256"></A>man who knows that chicken is wholesome is more likely to produce 
<A NAME="257"></A>health.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>Now practical wisdom is concerned with action; therefore one should 
<A NAME="259"></A>have both forms of it, or the latter in preference to the former. But of 
<A NAME="260"></A>practical as of philosophic wisdom there must be a controlling 
<A NAME="261"></A>kind.
<A NAME="262"></A><BR><BR>8
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>Political wisdom and practical wisdom are the same state of mind, 
<A NAME="264"></A>but their essence is not the same. Of the wisdom concerned with the city, 
<A NAME="265"></A>the practical wisdom which plays a controlling part is legislative wisdom, 
<A NAME="266"></A>while that which is related to this as particulars to their universal is 
<A NAME="267"></A>known by the general name 'political wisdom'; this has to do with action 
<A NAME="268"></A>and deliberation, for a decree is a thing to be carried out in the form 
<A NAME="269"></A>of an individual act. This is why the exponents of this art are alone said 
<A NAME="270"></A>to 'take part in politics'; for these alone 'do things' as manual labourers 
<A NAME="271"></A>'do things'.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>Practical wisdom also is identified especially with that form of 
<A NAME="273"></A>it which is concerned with a man himself-with the individual; and this 
<A NAME="274"></A>is known by the general name 'practical wisdom'; of the other kinds one 
<A NAME="275"></A>is called household management, another legislation, the third politics, 
<A NAME="276"></A>and of the latter one part is called deliberative and the other judicial. 
<A NAME="277"></A>Now knowing what is good for oneself will be one kind of knowledge, but 
<A NAME="278"></A>it is very different from the other kinds; and the man who knows and concerns 
<A NAME="279"></A>himself with his own interests is thought to have practical wisdom, while 
<A NAME="280"></A>politicians are thought to be busybodies; hence the word of 
<A NAME="281"></A>Euripides,
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>But how could I be wise, who might at ease,
<A NAME="283"></A><BR>Numbered among the army's multitude,
<A NAME="284"></A><BR>Have had an equal share?
<A NAME="285"></A><BR>For those who aim too high and do too much. Those who think thus seek 
<A NAME="286"></A>their own good, and consider that one ought to do so. From this opinion, 
<A NAME="287"></A>then, has come the view that such men have practical wisdom; yet perhaps 
<A NAME="288"></A>one's own good cannot exist without household management, nor without a 
<A NAME="289"></A>form of government. Further, how one should order one's own affairs is 
<A NAME="290"></A>not clear and needs inquiry.
<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>What has been said is confirmed by the fact that while young men 
<A NAME="292"></A>become geometricians and mathematicians and wise in matters like these, 
<A NAME="293"></A>it is thought that a young man of practical wisdom cannot be found. The 
<A NAME="294"></A>cause is that such wisdom is concerned not only with universals but with 
<A NAME="295"></A>particulars, which become familiar from experience, but a young man has 
<A NAME="296"></A>no experience, for it is length of time that gives experience; indeed one 
<A NAME="297"></A>might ask this question too, why a boy may become a mathematician, but 
<A NAME="298"></A>not a philosopher or a physicist. It is because the objects of mathematics 
<A NAME="299"></A>exist by abstraction, while the first principles of these other subjects 
<A NAME="300"></A>come from experience, and because young men have no conviction about the 
<A NAME="301"></A>latter but merely use the proper language, while the essence of mathematical 
<A NAME="302"></A>objects is plain enough to them?
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>Further, error in deliberation may be either about the universal 
<A NAME="304"></A>or about the particular; we may fall to know either that all water that 
<A NAME="305"></A>weighs heavy is bad, or that this particular water weighs 
<A NAME="306"></A>heavy.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>That practical wisdom is not scientific knowledge is evident; for 
<A NAME="308"></A>it is, as has been said, concerned with the ultimate particular fact, since 
<A NAME="309"></A>the thing to be done is of this nature. It is opposed, then, to intuitive 
<A NAME="310"></A>reason; for intuitive reason is of the limiting premisses, for which no 
<A NAME="311"></A>reason can be given, while practical wisdom is concerned with the ultimate 
<A NAME="312"></A>particular, which is the object not of scientific knowledge but of perception-not 
<A NAME="313"></A>the perception of qualities peculiar to one sense but a perception akin 
<A NAME="314"></A>to that by which we perceive that the particular figure before us is a 
<A NAME="315"></A>triangle; for in that direction as well as in that of the major premiss 
<A NAME="316"></A>there will be a limit. But this is rather perception than practical wisdom, 
<A NAME="317"></A>though it is another kind of perception than that of the qualities peculiar 
<A NAME="318"></A>to each sense.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>9
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>There is a difference between inquiry and deliberation; for deliberation 
<A NAME="321"></A>is inquiry into a particular kind of thing. We must grasp the nature of 
<A NAME="322"></A>excellence in deliberation as well whether it is a form of scientific knowledge, 
<A NAME="323"></A>or opinion, or skill in conjecture, or some other kind of thing. Scientific 
<A NAME="324"></A>knowledge it is not; for men do not inquire about the things they know 
<A NAME="325"></A>about, but good deliberation is a kind of deliberation, and he who deliberates 
<A NAME="326"></A>inquires and calculates. Nor is it skill in conjecture; for this both involves 
<A NAME="327"></A>no reasoning and is something that is quick in its operation, while men 
<A NAME="328"></A>deliberate a long time, and they say that one should carry out quickly 
<A NAME="329"></A>the conclusions of one's deliberation, but should deliberate slowly. Again, 
<A NAME="330"></A>readiness of mind is different from excellence in deliberation; it is a 
<A NAME="331"></A>sort of skill in conjecture. Nor again is excellence in deliberation opinion 
<A NAME="332"></A>of any sort. But since the man who deliberates badly makes a mistake, while 
<A NAME="333"></A>he who deliberates well does so correctly, excellence in deliberation is 
<A NAME="334"></A>clearly a kind of correctness, but neither of knowledge nor of opinion; 
<A NAME="335"></A>for there is no such thing as correctness of knowledge (since there is 
<A NAME="336"></A>no such thing as error of knowledge), and correctness of opinion is truth; 
<A NAME="337"></A>and at the same time everything that is an object of opinion is already 
<A NAME="338"></A>determined. But again excellence in deliberation involves reasoning. The 
<A NAME="339"></A>remaining alternative, then, is that it is correctness of thinking; for 
<A NAME="340"></A>this is not yet assertion, since, while even opinion is not inquiry but 
<A NAME="341"></A>has reached the stage of assertion, the man who is deliberating, whether 
<A NAME="342"></A>he does so well or ill, is searching for something and 
<A NAME="343"></A>calculating.
<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>But excellence in deliberation is a certain correctness of deliberation; 
<A NAME="345"></A>hence we must first inquire what deliberation is and what it is about. 
<A NAME="346"></A>And, there being more than one kind of correctness, plainly excellence 
<A NAME="347"></A>in deliberation is not any and every kind; for (1) the incontinent man 
<A NAME="348"></A>and the bad man, if he is clever, will reach as a result of his calculation 
<A NAME="349"></A>what he sets before himself, so that he will have deliberated correctly, 
<A NAME="350"></A>but he will have got for himself a great evil. Now to have deliberated 
<A NAME="351"></A>well is thought to be a good thing; for it is this kind of correctness 
<A NAME="352"></A>of deliberation that is excellence in deliberation, viz. that which tends 
<A NAME="353"></A>to attain what is good. But (2) it is possible to attain even good by a 
<A NAME="354"></A>false syllogism, and to attain what one ought to do but not by the right 
<A NAME="355"></A>means, the middle term being false; so that this too is not yet excellence 
<A NAME="356"></A>in deliberation this state in virtue of which one attains what one ought 
<A NAME="357"></A>but not by the right means. Again (3) it is possible to attain it by long 
<A NAME="358"></A>deliberation while another man attains it quickly. Therefore in the former 
<A NAME="359"></A>case we have not yet got excellence in deliberation, which is rightness 
<A NAME="360"></A>with regard to the expedient-rightness in respect both of the end, the 
<A NAME="361"></A>manner, and the time. (4) Further it is possible to have deliberated well 
<A NAME="362"></A>either in the unqualified sense or with reference to a particular end. 
<A NAME="363"></A>Excellence in deliberation in the unqualified sense, then, is that which 
<A NAME="364"></A>succeeds with reference to what is the end in the unqualified sense, and 
<A NAME="365"></A>excellence in deliberation in a particular sense is that which succeeds 
<A NAME="366"></A>relatively to a particular end. If, then, it is characteristic of men of 
<A NAME="367"></A>practical wisdom to have deliberated well, excellence in deliberation will 
<A NAME="368"></A>be correctness with regard to what conduces to the end of which practical 
<A NAME="369"></A>wisdom is the true apprehension.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>10
<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>Understanding, also, and goodness of understanding, in virtue of 
<A NAME="372"></A>which men are said to be men of understanding or of good understanding, 
<A NAME="373"></A>are neither entirely the same as opinion or scientific knowledge (for at 
<A NAME="374"></A>that rate all men would have been men of understanding), nor are they one 
<A NAME="375"></A>of the particular sciences, such as medicine, the science of things connected 
<A NAME="376"></A>with health, or geometry, the science of spatial magnitudes. For understanding 
<A NAME="377"></A>is neither about things that are always and are unchangeable, nor about 
<A NAME="378"></A>any and every one of the things that come into being, but about things 
<A NAME="379"></A>which may become subjects of questioning and deliberation. Hence it is 
<A NAME="380"></A>about the same objects as practical wisdom; but understanding and practical 
<A NAME="381"></A>wisdom are not the same. For practical wisdom issues commands, since its 
<A NAME="382"></A>end is what ought to be done or not to be done; but understanding only 
<A NAME="383"></A>judges. (Understanding is identical with goodness of understanding, men 
<A NAME="384"></A>of understanding with men of good understanding.) Now understanding is 
<A NAME="385"></A>neither the having nor the acquiring of practical wisdom; but as learning 
<A NAME="386"></A>is called understanding when it means the exercise of the faculty of knowledge, 
<A NAME="387"></A>so 'understanding' is applicable to the exercise of the faculty of opinion 
<A NAME="388"></A>for the purpose of judging of what some one else says about matters with 
<A NAME="389"></A>which practical wisdom is concerned-and of judging soundly; for 'well' 
<A NAME="390"></A>and 'soundly' are the same thing. And from this has come the use of the 
<A NAME="391"></A>name 'understanding' in virtue of which men are said to be 'of good understanding', 
<A NAME="392"></A>viz. from the application of the word to the grasping of scientific truth; 
<A NAME="393"></A>for we often call such grasping understanding.
<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>11
<A NAME="395"></A><BR><BR>What is called judgement, in virtue of which men are said to 'be 
<A NAME="396"></A>sympathetic judges' and to 'have judgement', is the right discrimination 
<A NAME="397"></A>of the equitable. This is shown by the fact that we say the equitable man 
<A NAME="398"></A>is above all others a man of sympathetic judgement, and identify equity 
<A NAME="399"></A>with sympathetic judgement about certain facts. And sympathetic judgement 
<A NAME="400"></A>is judgement which discriminates what is equitable and does so correctly; 
<A NAME="401"></A>and correct judgement is that which judges what is true.
<A NAME="402"></A><BR><BR>Now all the states we have considered converge, as might be expected, 
<A NAME="403"></A>to the same point; for when we speak of judgement and understanding and 
<A NAME="404"></A>practical wisdom and intuitive reason we credit the same people with possessing 
<A NAME="405"></A>judgement and having reached years of reason and with having practical 
<A NAME="406"></A>wisdom and understanding. For all these faculties deal with ultimates, 
<A NAME="407"></A>i.e. with particulars; and being a man of understanding and of good or 
<A NAME="408"></A>sympathetic judgement consists in being able judge about the things with 
<A NAME="409"></A>which practical wisdom is concerned; for the equities are common to all 
<A NAME="410"></A>good men in relation to other men. Now all things which have to be done 
<A NAME="411"></A>are included among particulars or ultimates; for not only must the man 
<A NAME="412"></A>of practical wisdom know particular facts, but understanding and judgement 
<A NAME="413"></A>are also concerned with things to be done, and these are ultimates. And 
<A NAME="414"></A>intuitive reason is concerned with the ultimates in both directions; for 
<A NAME="415"></A>both the first terms and the last are objects of intuitive reason and not 
<A NAME="416"></A>of argument, and the intuitive reason which is presupposed by demonstrations 
<A NAME="417"></A>grasps the unchangeable and first terms, while the intuitive reason involved 
<A NAME="418"></A>in practical reasonings grasps the last and variable fact, i.e. the minor 
<A NAME="419"></A>premiss. For these variable facts are the starting-points for the apprehension 
<A NAME="420"></A>of the end, since the universals are reached from the particulars; of these 
<A NAME="421"></A>therefore we must have perception, and this perception is intuitive 
<A NAME="422"></A>reason.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>This is why these states are thought to be natural endowments-why, 
<A NAME="424"></A>while no one is thought to be a philosopher by nature, people are thought 
<A NAME="425"></A>to have by nature judgement, understanding, and intuitive reason. This 
<A NAME="426"></A>is shown by the fact that we think our powers correspond to our time of 
<A NAME="427"></A>life, and that a particular age brings with it intuitive reason and judgement; 
<A NAME="428"></A>this implies that nature is the cause. (Hence intuitive reason is both 
<A NAME="429"></A>beginning and end; for demonstrations are from these and about these.) 
<A NAME="430"></A>Therefore we ought to attend to the undemonstrated sayings and opinions 
<A NAME="431"></A>of experienced and older people or of people of practical wisdom not less 
<A NAME="432"></A>than to demonstrations; for because experience has given them an eye they 
<A NAME="433"></A>see aright.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>We have stated, then, what practical and philosophic wisdom are, 
<A NAME="435"></A>and with what each of them is concerned, and we have said that each is 
<A NAME="436"></A>the virtue of a different part of the soul.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>12
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>Difficulties might be raised as to the utility of these qualities 
<A NAME="439"></A>of mind. For (1) philosophic wisdom will contemplate none of the things 
<A NAME="440"></A>that will make a man happy (for it is not concerned with any coming into 
<A NAME="441"></A>being), and though practical wisdom has this merit, for what purpose do 
<A NAME="442"></A>we need it? Practical wisdom is the quality of mind concerned with things 
<A NAME="443"></A>just and noble and good for man, but these are the things which it is the 
<A NAME="444"></A>mark of a good man to do, and we are none the more able to act for knowing 
<A NAME="445"></A>them if the virtues are states of character, just as we are none the better 
<A NAME="446"></A>able to act for knowing the things that are healthy and sound, in the sense 
<A NAME="447"></A>not of producing but of issuing from the state of health; for we are none 
<A NAME="448"></A>the more able to act for having the art of medicine or of gymnastics. But 
<A NAME="449"></A>(2) if we are to say that a man should have practical wisdom not for the 
<A NAME="450"></A>sake of knowing moral truths but for the sake of becoming good, practical 
<A NAME="451"></A>wisdom will be of no use to those who are good; again it is of no use to 
<A NAME="452"></A>those who have not virtue; for it will make no difference whether they 
<A NAME="453"></A>have practical wisdom themselves or obey others who have it, and it would 
<A NAME="454"></A>be enough for us to do what we do in the case of health; though we wish 
<A NAME="455"></A>to become healthy, yet we do not learn the art of medicine. (3) Besides 
<A NAME="456"></A>this, it would be thought strange if practical wisdom, being inferior to 
<A NAME="457"></A>philosophic wisdom, is to be put in authority over it, as seems to be implied 
<A NAME="458"></A>by the fact that the art which produces anything rules and issues commands 
<A NAME="459"></A>about that thing.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>These, then, are the questions we must discuss; so far we have 
<A NAME="461"></A>only stated the difficulties.
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR>(1) Now first let us say that in themselves these states must be 
<A NAME="463"></A>worthy of choice because they are the virtues of the two parts of the soul 
<A NAME="464"></A>respectively, even if neither of them produce anything.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>(2) Secondly, they do produce something, not as the art of medicine 
<A NAME="466"></A>produces health, however, but as health produces health; so does philosophic 
<A NAME="467"></A>wisdom produce happiness; for, being a part of virtue entire, by being 
<A NAME="468"></A>possessed and by actualizing itself it makes a man happy.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>(3) Again, the work of man is achieved only in accordance with 
<A NAME="470"></A>practical wisdom as well as with moral virtue; for virtue makes us aim 
<A NAME="471"></A>at the right mark, and practical wisdom makes us take the right means. 
<A NAME="472"></A>(Of the fourth part of the soul-the nutritive-there is no such virtue; 
<A NAME="473"></A>for there is nothing which it is in its power to do or not to 
<A NAME="474"></A>do.)
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR>(4) With regard to our being none the more able to do because of 
<A NAME="476"></A>our practical wisdom what is noble and just, let us begin a little further 
<A NAME="477"></A>back, starting with the following principle. As we say that some people 
<A NAME="478"></A>who do just acts are not necessarily just, i.e. those who do the acts ordained 
<A NAME="479"></A>by the laws either unwillingly or owing to ignorance or for some other 
<A NAME="480"></A>reason and not for the sake of the acts themselves (though, to be sure, 
<A NAME="481"></A>they do what they should and all the things that the good man ought), so 
<A NAME="482"></A>is it, it seems, that in order to be good one must be in a certain state 
<A NAME="483"></A>when one does the several acts, i.e. one must do them as a result of choice 
<A NAME="484"></A>and for the sake of the acts themselves. Now virtue makes the choice right, 
<A NAME="485"></A>but the question of the things which should naturally be done to carry 
<A NAME="486"></A>out our choice belongs not to virtue but to another faculty. We must devote 
<A NAME="487"></A>our attention to these matters and give a clearer statement about them. 
<A NAME="488"></A>There is a faculty which is called cleverness; and this is such as to be 
<A NAME="489"></A>able to do the things that tend towards the mark we have set before ourselves, 
<A NAME="490"></A>and to hit it. Now if the mark be noble, the cleverness is laudable, but 
<A NAME="491"></A>if the mark be bad, the cleverness is mere smartness; hence we call even 
<A NAME="492"></A>men of practical wisdom clever or smart. Practical wisdom is not the faculty, 
<A NAME="493"></A>but it does not exist without this faculty. And this eye of the soul acquires 
<A NAME="494"></A>its formed state not without the aid of virtue, as has been said and is 
<A NAME="495"></A>plain; for the syllogisms which deal with acts to be done are things which 
<A NAME="496"></A>involve a starting-point, viz. 'since the end, i.e. what is best, is of 
<A NAME="497"></A>such and such a nature', whatever it may be (let it for the sake of argument 
<A NAME="498"></A>be what we please); and this is not evident except to the good man; for 
<A NAME="499"></A>wickedness perverts us and causes us to be deceived about the starting-points 
<A NAME="500"></A>of action. Therefore it is evident that it is impossible to be practically 
<A NAME="501"></A>wise without being good.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>13
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR>We must therefore consider virtue also once more; for virtue too 
<A NAME="504"></A>is similarly related; as practical wisdom is to cleverness-not the same, 
<A NAME="505"></A>but like it-so is natural virtue to virtue in the strict sense. For all 
<A NAME="506"></A>men think that each type of character belongs to its possessors in some 
<A NAME="507"></A>sense by nature; for from the very moment of birth we are just or fitted 
<A NAME="508"></A>for selfcontrol or brave or have the other moral qualities; but yet we 
<A NAME="509"></A>seek something else as that which is good in the strict sense-we seek for 
<A NAME="510"></A>the presence of such qualities in another way. For both children and brutes 
<A NAME="511"></A>have the natural dispositions to these qualities, but without reason these 
<A NAME="512"></A>are evidently hurtful. Only we seem to see this much, that, while one may 
<A NAME="513"></A>be led astray by them, as a strong body which moves without sight may stumble 
<A NAME="514"></A>badly because of its lack of sight, still, if a man once acquires reason, 
<A NAME="515"></A>that makes a difference in action; and his state, while still like what 
<A NAME="516"></A>it was, will then be virtue in the strict sense. Therefore, as in the part 
<A NAME="517"></A>of us which forms opinions there are two types, cleverness and practical 
<A NAME="518"></A>wisdom, so too in the moral part there are two types, natural virtue and 
<A NAME="519"></A>virtue in the strict sense, and of these the latter involves practical 
<A NAME="520"></A>wisdom. This is why some say that all the virtues are forms of practical 
<A NAME="521"></A>wisdom, and why Socrates in one respect was on the right track while in 
<A NAME="522"></A>another he went astray; in thinking that all the virtues were forms of 
<A NAME="523"></A>practical wisdom he was wrong, but in saying they implied practical wisdom 
<A NAME="524"></A>he was right. This is confirmed by the fact that even now all men, when 
<A NAME="525"></A>they define virtue, after naming the state of character and its objects 
<A NAME="526"></A>add 'that (state) which is in accordance with the right rule'; now the 
<A NAME="527"></A>right rule is that which is in accordance with practical wisdom. All men, 
<A NAME="528"></A>then, seem somehow to divine that this kind of state is virtue, viz. that 
<A NAME="529"></A>which is in accordance with practical wisdom. But we must go a little further. 
<A NAME="530"></A>For it is not merely the state in accordance with the right rule, but the 
<A NAME="531"></A>state that implies the presence of the right rule, that is virtue; and 
<A NAME="532"></A>practical wisdom is a right rule about such matters. Socrates, then, thought 
<A NAME="533"></A>the virtues were rules or rational principles (for he thought they were, 
<A NAME="534"></A>all of them, forms of scientific knowledge), while we think they involve 
<A NAME="535"></A>a rational principle.
<A NAME="536"></A><BR><BR>It is clear, then, from what has been said, that it is not possible 
<A NAME="537"></A>to be good in the strict sense without practical wisdom, nor practically 
<A NAME="538"></A>wise without moral virtue. But in this way we may also refute the dialectical 
<A NAME="539"></A>argument whereby it might be contended that the virtues exist in separation 
<A NAME="540"></A>from each other; the same man, it might be said, is not best equipped by 
<A NAME="541"></A>nature for all the virtues, so that he will have already acquired one when 
<A NAME="542"></A>he has not yet acquired another. This is possible in respect of the natural 
<A NAME="543"></A>virtues, but not in respect of those in respect of which a man is called 
<A NAME="544"></A>without qualification good; for with the presence of the one quality, practical 
<A NAME="545"></A>wisdom, will be given all the virtues. And it is plain that, even if it 
<A NAME="546"></A>were of no practical value, we should have needed it because it is the 
<A NAME="547"></A>virtue of the part of us in question; plain too that the choice will not 
<A NAME="548"></A>be right without practical wisdom any more than without virtue; for the 
<A NAME="549"></A>one deter, mines the end and the other makes us do the things that lead 
<A NAME="550"></A>to the end.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR>But again it is not supreme over philosophic wisdom, i.e. over 
<A NAME="552"></A>the superior part of us, any more than the art of medicine is over health; 
<A NAME="553"></A>for it does not use it but provides for its coming into being; it issues 
<A NAME="554"></A>orders, then, for its sake, but not to it. Further, to maintain its supremacy 
<A NAME="555"></A>would be like saying that the art of politics rules the gods because it 
<A NAME="556"></A>issues orders about all the affairs of the state.
