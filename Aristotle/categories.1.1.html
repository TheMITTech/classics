<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Things are said to be named 'equivocally' when, though they have a common 
<A NAME="12"></A>name, the definition corresponding with the name differs for each. Thus, 
<A NAME="13"></A>a real man and a figure in a picture can both lay claim to the name 'animal'; 
<A NAME="14"></A>yet these are equivocally so named, for, though they have a common name, 
<A NAME="15"></A>the definition corresponding with the name differs for each. For should 
<A NAME="16"></A>any one define in what sense each is an animal, his definition in the one 
<A NAME="17"></A>case will be appropriate to that case only.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>On the other hand, things are said to be named 'univocally' which 
<A NAME="19"></A>have both the name and the definition answering to the name in common. 
<A NAME="20"></A>A man and an ox are both 'animal', and these are univocally so named, inasmuch 
<A NAME="21"></A>as not only the name, but also the definition, is the same in both cases: 
<A NAME="22"></A>for if a man should state in what sense each is an animal, the statement 
<A NAME="23"></A>in the one case would be identical with that in the 
<A NAME="24"></A>other.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>Things are said to be named 'derivatively', which derive their 
<A NAME="26"></A>name from some other name, but differ from it in termination. Thus the 
<A NAME="27"></A>grammarian derives his name from the word 'grammar', and the courageous 
<A NAME="28"></A>man from the word 'courage'.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="29"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>Forms of speech are either simple or composite. Examples of the 
<A NAME="31"></A>latter are such expressions as 'the man runs', 'the man wins'; of the former 
<A NAME="32"></A>'man', 'ox', 'runs', 'wins'.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>Of things themselves some are predicable of a subject, and are 
<A NAME="34"></A>never present in a subject. Thus 'man' is predicable of the individual 
<A NAME="35"></A>man, and is never present in a subject.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>By being 'present in a subject' I do not mean present as parts 
<A NAME="37"></A>are present in a whole, but being incapable of existence apart from the 
<A NAME="38"></A>said subject.
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>Some things, again, are present in a subject, but are never predicable 
<A NAME="40"></A>of a subject. For instance, a certain point of grammatical knowledge is 
<A NAME="41"></A>present in the mind, but is not predicable of any subject; or again, a 
<A NAME="42"></A>certain whiteness may be present in the body (for colour requires a material 
<A NAME="43"></A>basis), yet it is never predicable of anything.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>Other things, again, are both predicable of a subject and present 
<A NAME="45"></A>in a subject. Thus while knowledge is present in the human mind, it is 
<A NAME="46"></A>predicable of grammar.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>There is, lastly, a class of things which are neither present in 
<A NAME="48"></A>a subject nor predicable of a subject, such as the individual man or the 
<A NAME="49"></A>individual horse. But, to speak more generally, that which is individual 
<A NAME="50"></A>and has the character of a unit is never predicable of a subject. Yet in 
<A NAME="51"></A>some cases there is nothing to prevent such being present in a subject. 
<A NAME="52"></A>Thus a certain point of grammatical knowledge is present in a 
<A NAME="53"></A>subject.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="54"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="55"></A><BR><BR>When one thing is predicated of another, all that which is predicable 
<A NAME="56"></A>of the predicate will be predicable also of the subject. Thus, 'man' is 
<A NAME="57"></A>predicated of the individual man; but 'animal' is predicated of 'man'; 
<A NAME="58"></A>it will, therefore, be predicable of the individual man also: for the individual 
<A NAME="59"></A>man is both 'man' and 'animal'.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>If genera are different and co-ordinate, their differentiae are 
<A NAME="61"></A>themselves different in kind. Take as an instance the genus 'animal' and 
<A NAME="62"></A>the genus 'knowledge'. 'With feet', 'two-footed', 'winged', 'aquatic', 
<A NAME="63"></A>are differentiae of 'animal'; the species of knowledge are not distinguished 
<A NAME="64"></A>by the same differentiae. One species of knowledge does not differ from 
<A NAME="65"></A>another in being 'two-footed'.
<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>But where one genus is subordinate to another, there is nothing 
<A NAME="67"></A>to prevent their having the same differentiae: for the greater class is 
<A NAME="68"></A>predicated of the lesser, so that all the differentiae of the predicate 
<A NAME="69"></A>will be differentiae also of the subject.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="70"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Expressions which are in no way composite signify substance, quantity, 
<A NAME="72"></A>quality, relation, place, time, position, state, action, or affection. 
<A NAME="73"></A>To sketch my meaning roughly, examples of substance are 'man' or 'the horse', 
<A NAME="74"></A>of quantity, such terms as 'two cubits long' or 'three cubits long', of 
<A NAME="75"></A>quality, such attributes as 'white', 'grammatical'. 'Double', 'half', 'greater', 
<A NAME="76"></A>fall under the category of relation; 'in a the market place', 'in the Lyceum', 
<A NAME="77"></A>under that of place; 'yesterday', 'last year', under that of time. 'Lying', 
<A NAME="78"></A>'sitting', are terms indicating position, 'shod', 'armed', state; 'to lance', 
<A NAME="79"></A>'to cauterize', action; 'to be lanced', 'to be cauterized', 
<A NAME="80"></A>affection.
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>No one of these terms, in and by itself, involves an affirmation; 
<A NAME="82"></A>it is by the combination of such terms that positive or negative statements 
<A NAME="83"></A>arise. For every assertion must, as is admitted, be either true or false, 
<A NAME="84"></A>whereas expressions which are not in any way composite such as 'man', 'white', 
<A NAME="85"></A>'runs', 'wins', cannot be either true or false.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="86"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>Substance, in the truest and primary and most definite sense of 
<A NAME="88"></A>the word, is that which is neither predicable of a subject nor present 
<A NAME="89"></A>in a subject; for instance, the individual man or horse. But in a secondary 
<A NAME="90"></A>sense those things are called substances within which, as species, the 
<A NAME="91"></A>primary substances are included; also those which, as genera, include the 
<A NAME="92"></A>species. For instance, the individual man is included in the species 'man', 
<A NAME="93"></A>and the genus to which the species belongs is 'animal'; these, therefore-that 
<A NAME="94"></A>is to say, the species 'man' and the genus 'animal,-are termed secondary 
<A NAME="95"></A>substances.
<A NAME="96"></A><BR><BR>It is plain from what has been said that both the name and the 
<A NAME="97"></A>definition of the predicate must be predicable of the subject. For instance, 
<A NAME="98"></A>'man' is predicted of the individual man. Now in this case the name of 
<A NAME="99"></A>the species man' is applied to the individual, for we use the term 'man' 
<A NAME="100"></A>in describing the individual; and the definition of 'man' will also be 
<A NAME="101"></A>predicated of the individual man, for the individual man is both man and 
<A NAME="102"></A>animal. Thus, both the name and the definition of the species are predicable 
<A NAME="103"></A>of the individual.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>With regard, on the other hand, to those things which are present 
<A NAME="105"></A>in a subject, it is generally the case that neither their name nor their 
<A NAME="106"></A>definition is predicable of that in which they are present. Though, however, 
<A NAME="107"></A>the definition is never predicable, there is nothing in certain cases to 
<A NAME="108"></A>prevent the name being used. For instance, 'white' being present in a body 
<A NAME="109"></A>is predicated of that in which it is present, for a body is called white: 
<A NAME="110"></A>the definition, however, of the colour white' is never predicable of the 
<A NAME="111"></A>body.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>Everything except primary substances is either predicable of a 
<A NAME="113"></A>primary substance or present in a primary substance. This becomes evident 
<A NAME="114"></A>by reference to particular instances which occur. 'Animal' is predicated 
<A NAME="115"></A>of the species 'man', therefore of the individual man, for if there were 
<A NAME="116"></A>no individual man of whom it could be predicated, it could not be predicated 
<A NAME="117"></A>of the species 'man' at all. Again, colour is present in body, therefore 
<A NAME="118"></A>in individual bodies, for if there were no individual body in which it 
<A NAME="119"></A>was present, it could not be present in body at all. Thus everything except 
<A NAME="120"></A>primary substances is either predicated of primary substances, or is present 
<A NAME="121"></A>in them, and if these last did not exist, it would be impossible for anything 
<A NAME="122"></A>else to exist.
<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>Of secondary substances, the species is more truly substance than 
<A NAME="124"></A>the genus, being more nearly related to primary substance. For if any one 
<A NAME="125"></A>should render an account of what a primary substance is, he would render 
<A NAME="126"></A>a more instructive account, and one more proper to the subject, by stating 
<A NAME="127"></A>the species than by stating the genus. Thus, he would give a more instructive 
<A NAME="128"></A>account of an individual man by stating that he was man than by stating 
<A NAME="129"></A>that he was animal, for the former description is peculiar to the individual 
<A NAME="130"></A>in a greater degree, while the latter is too general. Again, the man who 
<A NAME="131"></A>gives an account of the nature of an individual tree will give a more instructive 
<A NAME="132"></A>account by mentioning the species 'tree' than by mentioning the genus 
<A NAME="133"></A>'plant'.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, primary substances are most properly called substances 
<A NAME="135"></A>in virtue of the fact that they are the entities which underlie every. 
<A NAME="136"></A>else, and that everything else is either predicated of them or present 
<A NAME="137"></A>in them. Now the same relation which subsists between primary substance 
<A NAME="138"></A>and everything else subsists also between the species and the genus: for 
<A NAME="139"></A>the species is to the genus as subject is to predicate, since the genus 
<A NAME="140"></A>is predicated of the species, whereas the species cannot be predicated 
<A NAME="141"></A>of the genus. Thus we have a second ground for asserting that the species 
<A NAME="142"></A>is more truly substance than the genus.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>Of species themselves, except in the case of such as are genera, 
<A NAME="144"></A>no one is more truly substance than another. We should not give a more 
<A NAME="145"></A>appropriate account of the individual man by stating the species to which 
<A NAME="146"></A>he belonged, than we should of an individual horse by adopting the same 
<A NAME="147"></A>method of definition. In the same way, of primary substances, no one is 
<A NAME="148"></A>more truly substance than another; an individual man is not more truly 
<A NAME="149"></A>substance than an individual ox.
<A NAME="150"></A><BR><BR>It is, then, with good reason that of all that remains, when we 
<A NAME="151"></A>exclude primary substances, we concede to species and genera alone the 
<A NAME="152"></A>name 'secondary substance', for these alone of all the predicates convey 
<A NAME="153"></A>a knowledge of primary substance. For it is by stating the species or the 
<A NAME="154"></A>genus that we appropriately define any individual man; and we shall make 
<A NAME="155"></A>our definition more exact by stating the former than by stating the latter. 
<A NAME="156"></A>All other things that we state, such as that he is white, that he runs, 
<A NAME="157"></A>and so on, are irrelevant to the definition. Thus it is just that these 
<A NAME="158"></A>alone, apart from primary substances, should be called 
<A NAME="159"></A>substances.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>Further, primary substances are most properly so called, because 
<A NAME="161"></A>they underlie and are the subjects of everything else. Now the same relation 
<A NAME="162"></A>that subsists between primary substance and everything else subsists also 
<A NAME="163"></A>between the species and the genus to which the primary substance belongs, 
<A NAME="164"></A>on the one hand, and every attribute which is not included within these, 
<A NAME="165"></A>on the other. For these are the subjects of all such. If we call an individual 
<A NAME="166"></A>man 'skilled in grammar', the predicate is applicable also to the species 
<A NAME="167"></A>and to the genus to which he belongs. This law holds good in all 
<A NAME="168"></A>cases.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>It is a common characteristic of all sub. stance that it is never 
<A NAME="170"></A>present in a subject. For primary substance is neither present in a subject 
<A NAME="171"></A>nor predicated of a subject; while, with regard to secondary substances, 
<A NAME="172"></A>it is clear from the following arguments (apart from others) that they 
<A NAME="173"></A>are not present in a subject. For 'man' is predicated of the individual 
<A NAME="174"></A>man, but is not present in any subject: for manhood is not present in the 
<A NAME="175"></A>individual man. In the same way, 'animal' is also predicated of the individual 
<A NAME="176"></A>man, but is not present in him. Again, when a thing is present in a subject, 
<A NAME="177"></A>though the name may quite well be applied to that in which it is present, 
<A NAME="178"></A>the definition cannot be applied. Yet of secondary substances, not only 
<A NAME="179"></A>the name, but also the definition, applies to the subject: we should use 
<A NAME="180"></A>both the definition of the species and that of the genus with reference 
<A NAME="181"></A>to the individual man. Thus substance cannot be present in a 
<A NAME="182"></A>subject.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>Yet this is not peculiar to substance, for it is also the case 
<A NAME="184"></A>that differentiae cannot be present in subjects. The characteristics 'terrestrial' 
<A NAME="185"></A>and 'two-footed' are predicated of the species 'man', but not present in 
<A NAME="186"></A>it. For they are not in man. Moreover, the definition of the differentia 
<A NAME="187"></A>may be predicated of that of which the differentia itself is predicated. 
<A NAME="188"></A>For instance, if the characteristic 'terrestrial' is predicated of the 
<A NAME="189"></A>species 'man', the definition also of that characteristic may be used to 
<A NAME="190"></A>form the predicate of the species 'man': for 'man' is 
<A NAME="191"></A>terrestrial.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>The fact that the parts of substances appear to be present in the 
<A NAME="193"></A>whole, as in a subject, should not make us apprehensive lest we should 
<A NAME="194"></A>have to admit that such parts are not substances: for in explaining the 
<A NAME="195"></A>phrase 'being present in a subject', we stated' that we meant 'otherwise 
<A NAME="196"></A>than as parts in a whole'.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>It is the mark of substances and of differentiae that, in all propositions 
<A NAME="198"></A>of which they form the predicate, they are predicated univocally. For all 
<A NAME="199"></A>such propositions have for their subject either the individual or the species. 
<A NAME="200"></A>It is true that, inasmuch as primary substance is not predicable of anything, 
<A NAME="201"></A>it can never form the predicate of any proposition. But of secondary substances, 
<A NAME="202"></A>the species is predicated of the individual, the genus both of the species 
<A NAME="203"></A>and of the individual. Similarly the differentiae are predicated of the 
<A NAME="204"></A>species and of the individuals. Moreover, the definition of the species 
<A NAME="205"></A>and that of the genus are applicable to the primary substance, and that 
<A NAME="206"></A>of the genus to the species. For all that is predicated of the predicate 
<A NAME="207"></A>will be predicated also of the subject. Similarly, the definition of the 
<A NAME="208"></A>differentiae will be applicable to the species and to the individuals. 
<A NAME="209"></A>But it was stated above that the word 'univocal' was applied to those things 
<A NAME="210"></A>which had both name and definition in common. It is, therefore, established 
<A NAME="211"></A>that in every proposition, of which either substance or a differentia forms 
<A NAME="212"></A>the predicate, these are predicated univocally.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>All substance appears to signify that which is individual. In the 
<A NAME="214"></A>case of primary substance this is indisputably true, for the thing is a 
<A NAME="215"></A>unit. In the case of secondary substances, when we speak, for instance, 
<A NAME="216"></A>of 'man' or 'animal', our form of speech gives the impression that we are 
<A NAME="217"></A>here also indicating that which is individual, but the impression is not 
<A NAME="218"></A>strictly true; for a secondary substance is not an individual, but a class 
<A NAME="219"></A>with a certain qualification; for it is not one and single as a primary 
<A NAME="220"></A>substance is; the words 'man', 'animal', are predicable of more than one 
<A NAME="221"></A>subject.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>Yet species and genus do not merely indicate quality, like the 
<A NAME="223"></A>term 'white'; 'white' indicates quality and nothing further, but species 
<A NAME="224"></A>and genus determine the quality with reference to a substance: they signify 
<A NAME="225"></A>substance qualitatively differentiated. The determinate qualification covers 
<A NAME="226"></A>a larger field in the case of the genus that in that of the species: he 
<A NAME="227"></A>who uses the word 'animal' is herein using a word of wider extension than 
<A NAME="228"></A>he who uses the word 'man'.
<A NAME="229"></A><BR><BR>Another mark of substance is that it has no contrary. What could 
<A NAME="230"></A>be the contrary of any primary substance, such as the individual man or 
<A NAME="231"></A>animal? It has none. Nor can the species or the genus have a contrary. 
<A NAME="232"></A>Yet this characteristic is not peculiar to substance, but is true of many 
<A NAME="233"></A>other things, such as quantity. There is nothing that forms the contrary 
<A NAME="234"></A>of 'two cubits long' or of 'three cubits long', or of 'ten', or of any 
<A NAME="235"></A>such term. A man may contend that 'much' is the contrary of 'little', or 
<A NAME="236"></A>'great' of 'small', but of definite quantitative terms no contrary 
<A NAME="237"></A>exists.
<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>Substance, again, does not appear to admit of variation of degree. 
<A NAME="239"></A>I do not mean by this that one substance cannot be more or less truly substance 
<A NAME="240"></A>than another, for it has already been stated' that this is the case; but 
<A NAME="241"></A>that no single substance admits of varying degrees within itself. For instance, 
<A NAME="242"></A>one particular substance, 'man', cannot be more or less man either than 
<A NAME="243"></A>himself at some other time or than some other man. One man cannot be more 
<A NAME="244"></A>man than another, as that which is white may be more or less white than 
<A NAME="245"></A>some other white object, or as that which is beautiful may be more or less 
<A NAME="246"></A>beautiful than some other beautiful object. The same quality, moreover, 
<A NAME="247"></A>is said to subsist in a thing in varying degrees at different times. A 
<A NAME="248"></A>body, being white, is said to be whiter at one time than it was before, 
<A NAME="249"></A>or, being warm, is said to be warmer or less warm than at some other time. 
<A NAME="250"></A>But substance is not said to be more or less that which it is: a man is 
<A NAME="251"></A>not more truly a man at one time than he was before, nor is anything, if 
<A NAME="252"></A>it is substance, more or less what it is. Substance, then, does not admit 
<A NAME="253"></A>of variation of degree.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>The most distinctive mark of substance appears to be that, while 
<A NAME="255"></A>remaining numerically one and the same, it is capable of admitting contrary 
<A NAME="256"></A>qualities. From among things other than substance, we should find ourselves 
<A NAME="257"></A>unable to bring forward any which possessed this mark. Thus, one and the 
<A NAME="258"></A>same colour cannot be white and black. Nor can the same one action be good 
<A NAME="259"></A>and bad: this law holds good with everything that is not substance. But 
<A NAME="260"></A>one and the selfsame substance, while retaining its identity, is yet capable 
<A NAME="261"></A>of admitting contrary qualities. The same individual person is at one time 
<A NAME="262"></A>white, at another black, at one time warm, at another cold, at one time 
<A NAME="263"></A>good, at another bad. This capacity is found nowhere else, though it might 
<A NAME="264"></A>be maintained that a statement or opinion was an exception to the rule. 
<A NAME="265"></A>The same statement, it is agreed, can be both true and false. For if the 
<A NAME="266"></A>statement 'he is sitting' is true, yet, when the person in question has 
<A NAME="267"></A>risen, the same statement will be false. The same applies to opinions. 
<A NAME="268"></A>For if any one thinks truly that a person is sitting, yet, when that person 
<A NAME="269"></A>has risen, this same opinion, if still held, will be false. Yet although 
<A NAME="270"></A>this exception may be allowed, there is, nevertheless, a difference in 
<A NAME="271"></A>the manner in which the thing takes place. It is by themselves changing 
<A NAME="272"></A>that substances admit contrary qualities. It is thus that that which was 
<A NAME="273"></A>hot becomes cold, for it has entered into a different state. Similarly 
<A NAME="274"></A>that which was white becomes black, and that which was bad good, by a process 
<A NAME="275"></A>of change; and in the same way in all other cases it is by changing that 
<A NAME="276"></A>substances are capable of admitting contrary qualities. But statements 
<A NAME="277"></A>and opinions themselves remain unaltered in all respects: it is by the 
<A NAME="278"></A>alteration in the facts of the case that the contrary quality comes to 
<A NAME="279"></A>be theirs. The statement 'he is sitting' remains unaltered, but it is at 
<A NAME="280"></A>one time true, at another false, according to circumstances. What has been 
<A NAME="281"></A>said of statements applies also to opinions. Thus, in respect of the manner 
<A NAME="282"></A>in which the thing takes place, it is the peculiar mark of substance that 
<A NAME="283"></A>it should be capable of admitting contrary qualities; for it is by itself 
<A NAME="284"></A>changing that it does so.
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>If, then, a man should make this exception and contend that statements 
<A NAME="286"></A>and opinions are capable of admitting contrary qualities, his contention 
<A NAME="287"></A>is unsound. For statements and opinions are said to have this capacity, 
<A NAME="288"></A>not because they themselves undergo modification, but because this modification 
<A NAME="289"></A>occurs in the case of something else. The truth or falsity of a statement 
<A NAME="290"></A>depends on facts, and not on any power on the part of the statement itself 
<A NAME="291"></A>of admitting contrary qualities. In short, there is nothing which can alter 
<A NAME="292"></A>the nature of statements and opinions. As, then, no change takes place 
<A NAME="293"></A>in themselves, these cannot be said to be capable of admitting contrary 
<A NAME="294"></A>qualities.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>But it is by reason of the modification which takes place within 
<A NAME="296"></A>the substance itself that a substance is said to be capable of admitting 
<A NAME="297"></A>contrary qualities; for a substance admits within itself either disease 
<A NAME="298"></A>or health, whiteness or blackness. It is in this sense that it is said 
<A NAME="299"></A>to be capable of admitting contrary qualities.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>To sum up, it is a distinctive mark of substance, that, while remaining 
<A NAME="301"></A>numerically one and the same, it is capable of admitting contrary qualities, 
<A NAME="302"></A>the modification taking place through a change in the substance 
<A NAME="303"></A>itself.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>Let these remarks suffice on the subject of 
<A NAME="305"></A>substance.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="306"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>Quantity is either discrete or continuous. Moreover, some quantities 
<A NAME="308"></A>are such that each part of the whole has a relative position to the other 
<A NAME="309"></A>parts: others have within them no such relation of part to 
<A NAME="310"></A>part.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>Instances of discrete quantities are number and speech; of continuous, 
<A NAME="312"></A>lines, surfaces, solids, and, besides these, time and 
<A NAME="313"></A>place.
<A NAME="314"></A><BR><BR>In the case of the parts of a number, there is no common boundary 
<A NAME="315"></A>at which they join. For example: two fives make ten, but the two fives 
<A NAME="316"></A>have no common boundary, but are separate; the parts three and seven also 
<A NAME="317"></A>do not join at any boundary. Nor, to generalize, would it ever be possible 
<A NAME="318"></A>in the case of number that there should be a common boundary among the 
<A NAME="319"></A>parts; they are always separate. Number, therefore, is a discrete 
<A NAME="320"></A>quantity.
<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>The same is true of speech. That speech is a quantity is evident: 
<A NAME="322"></A>for it is measured in long and short syllables. I mean here that speech 
<A NAME="323"></A>which is vocal. Moreover, it is a discrete quantity for its parts have 
<A NAME="324"></A>no common boundary. There is no common boundary at which the syllables 
<A NAME="325"></A>join, but each is separate and distinct from the rest.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>A line, on the other hand, is a continuous quantity, for it is 
<A NAME="327"></A>possible to find a common boundary at which its parts join. In the case 
<A NAME="328"></A>of the line, this common boundary is the point; in the case of the plane, 
<A NAME="329"></A>it is the line: for the parts of the plane have also a common boundary. 
<A NAME="330"></A>Similarly you can find a common boundary in the case of the parts of a 
<A NAME="331"></A>solid, namely either a line or a plane.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>Space and time also belong to this class of quantities. Time, past, 
<A NAME="333"></A>present, and future, forms a continuous whole. Space, likewise, is a continuous 
<A NAME="334"></A>quantity; for the parts of a solid occupy a certain space, and these have 
<A NAME="335"></A>a common boundary; it follows that the parts of space also, which are occupied 
<A NAME="336"></A>by the parts of the solid, have the same common boundary as the parts of 
<A NAME="337"></A>the solid. Thus, not only time, but space also, is a continuous quantity, 
<A NAME="338"></A>for its parts have a common boundary.
<A NAME="339"></A><BR><BR>Quantities consist either of parts which bear a relative position 
<A NAME="340"></A>each to each, or of parts which do not. The parts of a line bear a relative 
<A NAME="341"></A>position to each other, for each lies somewhere, and it would be possible 
<A NAME="342"></A>to distinguish each, and to state the position of each on the plane and 
<A NAME="343"></A>to explain to what sort of part among the rest each was contiguous. Similarly 
<A NAME="344"></A>the parts of a plane have position, for it could similarly be stated what 
<A NAME="345"></A>was the position of each and what sort of parts were contiguous. The same 
<A NAME="346"></A>is true with regard to the solid and to space. But it would be impossible 
<A NAME="347"></A>to show that the arts of a number had a relative position each to each, 
<A NAME="348"></A>or a particular position, or to state what parts were contiguous. Nor could 
<A NAME="349"></A>this be done in the case of time, for none of the parts of time has an 
<A NAME="350"></A>abiding existence, and that which does not abide can hardly have position. 
<A NAME="351"></A>It would be better to say that such parts had a relative order, in virtue 
<A NAME="352"></A>of one being prior to another. Similarly with number: in counting, 'one' 
<A NAME="353"></A>is prior to 'two', and 'two' to 'three', and thus the parts of number may 
<A NAME="354"></A>be said to possess a relative order, though it would be impossible to discover 
<A NAME="355"></A>any distinct position for each. This holds good also in the case of speech. 
<A NAME="356"></A>None of its parts has an abiding existence: when once a syllable is pronounced, 
<A NAME="357"></A>it is not possible to retain it, so that, naturally, as the parts do not 
<A NAME="358"></A>abide, they cannot have position. Thus, some quantities consist of parts 
<A NAME="359"></A>which have position, and some of those which have not.
<A NAME="360"></A><BR><BR>Strictly speaking, only the things which I have mentioned belong 
<A NAME="361"></A>to the category of quantity: everything else that is called quantitative 
<A NAME="362"></A>is a quantity in a secondary sense. It is because we have in mind some 
<A NAME="363"></A>one of these quantities, properly so called, that we apply quantitative 
<A NAME="364"></A>terms to other things. We speak of what is white as large, because the 
<A NAME="365"></A>surface over which the white extends is large; we speak of an action or 
<A NAME="366"></A>a process as lengthy, because the time covered is long; these things cannot 
<A NAME="367"></A>in their own right claim the quantitative epithet. For instance, should 
<A NAME="368"></A>any one explain how long an action was, his statement would be made in 
<A NAME="369"></A>terms of the time taken, to the effect that it lasted a year, or something 
<A NAME="370"></A>of that sort. In the same way, he would explain the size of a white object 
<A NAME="371"></A>in terms of surface, for he would state the area which it covered. Thus 
<A NAME="372"></A>the things already mentioned, and these alone, are in their intrinsic nature 
<A NAME="373"></A>quantities; nothing else can claim the name in its own right, but, if at 
<A NAME="374"></A>all, only in a secondary sense.
<A NAME="375"></A><BR><BR>Quantities have no contraries. In the case of definite quantities 
<A NAME="376"></A>this is obvious; thus, there is nothing that is the contrary of 'two cubits 
<A NAME="377"></A>long' or of 'three cubits long', or of a surface, or of any such quantities. 
<A NAME="378"></A>A man might, indeed, argue that 'much' was the contrary of 'little', and 
<A NAME="379"></A>'great' of 'small'. But these are not quantitative, but relative; things 
<A NAME="380"></A>are not great or small absolutely, they are so called rather as the result 
<A NAME="381"></A>of an act of comparison. For instance, a mountain is called small, a grain 
<A NAME="382"></A>large, in virtue of the fact that the latter is greater than others of 
<A NAME="383"></A>its kind, the former less. Thus there is a reference here to an external 
<A NAME="384"></A>standard, for if the terms 'great' and 'small' were used absolutely, a 
<A NAME="385"></A>mountain would never be called small or a grain large. Again, we say that 
<A NAME="386"></A>there are many people in a village, and few in Athens, although those in 
<A NAME="387"></A>the city are many times as numerous as those in the village: or we say 
<A NAME="388"></A>that a house has many in it, and a theatre few, though those in the theatre 
<A NAME="389"></A>far outnumber those in the house. The terms 'two cubits long, "three cubits 
<A NAME="390"></A>long,' and so on indicate quantity, the terms 'great' and 'small' indicate 
<A NAME="391"></A>relation, for they have reference to an external standard. It is, therefore, 
<A NAME="392"></A>plain that these are to be classed as relative.
<A NAME="393"></A><BR><BR>Again, whether we define them as quantitative or not, they have 
<A NAME="394"></A>no contraries: for how can there be a contrary of an attribute which is 
<A NAME="395"></A>not to be apprehended in or by itself, but only by reference to something 
<A NAME="396"></A>external? Again, if 'great' and 'small' are contraries, it will come about 
<A NAME="397"></A>that the same subject can admit contrary qualities at one and the same 
<A NAME="398"></A>time, and that things will themselves be contrary to themselves. For it 
<A NAME="399"></A>happens at times that the same thing is both small and great. For the same 
<A NAME="400"></A>thing may be small in comparison with one thing, and great in comparison 
<A NAME="401"></A>with another, so that the same thing comes to be both small and great at 
<A NAME="402"></A>one and the same time, and is of such a nature as to admit contrary qualities 
<A NAME="403"></A>at one and the same moment. Yet it was agreed, when substance was being 
<A NAME="404"></A>discussed, that nothing admits contrary qualities at one and the same moment. 
<A NAME="405"></A>For though substance is capable of admitting contrary qualities, yet no 
<A NAME="406"></A>one is at the same time both sick and healthy, nothing is at the same time 
<A NAME="407"></A>both white and black. Nor is there anything which is qualified in contrary 
<A NAME="408"></A>ways at one and the same time.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, if these were contraries, they would themselves be contrary 
<A NAME="410"></A>to themselves. For if 'great' is the contrary of 'small', and the same 
<A NAME="411"></A>thing is both great and small at the same time, then 'small' or 'great' 
<A NAME="412"></A>is the contrary of itself. But this is impossible. The term 'great', therefore, 
<A NAME="413"></A>is not the contrary of the term 'small', nor 'much' of 'little'. And even 
<A NAME="414"></A>though a man should call these terms not relative but quantitative, they 
<A NAME="415"></A>would not have contraries.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR><BR>It is in the case of space that quantity most plausibly appears 
<A NAME="417"></A>to admit of a contrary. For men define the term 'above' as the contrary 
<A NAME="418"></A>of 'below', when it is the region at the centre they mean by 'below'; and 
<A NAME="419"></A>this is so, because nothing is farther from the extremities of the universe 
<A NAME="420"></A>than the region at the centre. Indeed, it seems that in defining contraries 
<A NAME="421"></A>of every kind men have recourse to a spatial metaphor, for they say that 
<A NAME="422"></A>those things are contraries which, within the same class, are separated 
<A NAME="423"></A>by the greatest possible distance.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>Quantity does not, it appears, admit of variation of degree. One 
<A NAME="425"></A>thing cannot be two cubits long in a greater degree than another. Similarly 
<A NAME="426"></A>with regard to number: what is 'three' is not more truly three than what 
<A NAME="427"></A>is 'five' is five; nor is one set of three more truly three than another 
<A NAME="428"></A>set. Again, one period of time is not said to be more truly time than another. 
<A NAME="429"></A>Nor is there any other kind of quantity, of all that have been mentioned, 
<A NAME="430"></A>with regard to which variation of degree can be predicated. The category 
<A NAME="431"></A>of quantity, therefore, does not admit of variation of 
<A NAME="432"></A>degree.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>The most distinctive mark of quantity is that equality and inequality 
<A NAME="434"></A>are predicated of it. Each of the aforesaid quantities is said to be equal 
<A NAME="435"></A>or unequal. For instance, one solid is said to be equal or unequal to another; 
<A NAME="436"></A>number, too, and time can have these terms applied to them, indeed can 
<A NAME="437"></A>all those kinds of quantity that have been mentioned.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>That which is not a quantity can by no means, it would seem, be 
<A NAME="439"></A>termed equal or unequal to anything else. One particular disposition or 
<A NAME="440"></A>one particular quality, such as whiteness, is by no means compared with 
<A NAME="441"></A>another in terms of equality and inequality but rather in terms of similarity. 
<A NAME="442"></A>Thus it is the distinctive mark of quantity that it can be called equal 
<A NAME="443"></A>and unequal.
