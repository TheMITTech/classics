<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part I</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>He who would inquire into the essence and attributes of various kinds of 
<A NAME="12"></A>governments must first of all determine 'What is a state?' At present this 
<A NAME="13"></A>is a disputed question. Some say that the state has done a certain act; 
<A NAME="14"></A>others, no, not the state, but the oligarchy or the tyrant. And the legislator 
<A NAME="15"></A>or statesman is concerned entirely with the state; a constitution or government 
<A NAME="16"></A>being an arrangement of the inhabitants of a state. But a state is composite, 
<A NAME="17"></A>like any other whole made up of many parts; these are the citizens, who 
<A NAME="18"></A>compose it. It is evident, therefore, that we must begin by asking, Who 
<A NAME="19"></A>is the citizen, and what is the meaning of the term? For here again there 
<A NAME="20"></A>may be a difference of opinion. He who is a citizen in a democracy will 
<A NAME="21"></A>often not be a citizen in an oligarchy. Leaving out of consideration those 
<A NAME="22"></A>who have been made citizens, or who have obtained the name of citizen any 
<A NAME="23"></A>other accidental manner, we may say, first, that a citizen is not a citizen 
<A NAME="24"></A>because he lives in a certain place, for resident aliens and slaves share 
<A NAME="25"></A>in the place; nor is he a citizen who has no legal right except that of 
<A NAME="26"></A>suing and being sued; for this right may be enjoyed under the provisions 
<A NAME="27"></A>of a treaty. Nay, resident aliens in many places do not possess even such 
<A NAME="28"></A>rights completely, for they are obliged to have a patron, so that they 
<A NAME="29"></A>do but imperfectly participate in citizenship, and we call them citizens 
<A NAME="30"></A>only in a qualified sense, as we might apply the term to children who are 
<A NAME="31"></A>too young to be on the register, or to old men who have been relieved from 
<A NAME="32"></A>state duties. Of these we do not say quite simply that they are citizens, 
<A NAME="33"></A>but add in the one case that they are not of age, and in the other, that 
<A NAME="34"></A>they are past the age, or something of that sort; the precise expression 
<A NAME="35"></A>is immaterial, for our meaning is clear. Similar difficulties to those 
<A NAME="36"></A>which I have mentioned may be raised and answered about deprived citizens 
<A NAME="37"></A>and about exiles. But the citizen whom we are seeking to define is a citizen 
<A NAME="38"></A>in the strictest sense, against whom no such exception can be taken, and 
<A NAME="39"></A>his special characteristic is that he shares in the administration of justice, 
<A NAME="40"></A>and in offices. Now of offices some are discontinuous, and the same persons 
<A NAME="41"></A>are not allowed to hold them twice, or can only hold them after a fixed 
<A NAME="42"></A>interval; others have no limit of time- for example, the office of a dicast 
<A NAME="43"></A>or ecclesiast. It may, indeed, be argued that these are not magistrates 
<A NAME="44"></A>at all, and that their functions give them no share in the government. 
<A NAME="45"></A>But surely it is ridiculous to say that those who have the power do not 
<A NAME="46"></A>govern. Let us not dwell further upon this, which is a purely verbal question; 
<A NAME="47"></A>what we want is a common term including both dicast and ecclesiast. Let 
<A NAME="48"></A>us, for the sake of distinction, call it 'indefinite office,' and we will 
<A NAME="49"></A>assume that those who share in such office are citizens. This is the most 
<A NAME="50"></A>comprehensive definition of a citizen, and best suits all those who are 
<A NAME="51"></A>generally so called.
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>But we must not forget that things of which the underlying principles 
<A NAME="53"></A>differ in kind, one of them being first, another second, another third, 
<A NAME="54"></A>have, when regarded in this relation, nothing, or hardly anything, worth 
<A NAME="55"></A>mentioning in common. Now we see that governments differ in kind, and that 
<A NAME="56"></A>some of them are prior and that others are posterior; those which are faulty 
<A NAME="57"></A>or perverted are necessarily posterior to those which are perfect. (What 
<A NAME="58"></A>we mean by perversion will be hereafter explained.) The citizen then of 
<A NAME="59"></A>necessity differs under each form of government; and our definition is 
<A NAME="60"></A>best adapted to the citizen of a democracy; but not necessarily to other 
<A NAME="61"></A>states. For in some states the people are not acknowledged, nor have they 
<A NAME="62"></A>any regular assembly, but only extraordinary ones; and suits are distributed 
<A NAME="63"></A>by sections among the magistrates. At Lacedaemon, for instance, the Ephors 
<A NAME="64"></A>determine suits about contracts, which they distribute among themselves, 
<A NAME="65"></A>while the elders are judges of homicide, and other causes are decided by 
<A NAME="66"></A>other magistrates. A similar principle prevails at Carthage; there certain 
<A NAME="67"></A>magistrates decide all causes. We may, indeed, modify our definition of 
<A NAME="68"></A>the citizen so as to include these states. In them it is the holder of 
<A NAME="69"></A>a definite, not of an indefinite office, who legislates and judges, and 
<A NAME="70"></A>to some or all such holders of definite offices is reserved the right of 
<A NAME="71"></A>deliberating or judging about some things or about all things. The conception 
<A NAME="72"></A>of the citizen now begins to clear up.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>He who has the power to take part in the deliberative or judicial 
<A NAME="74"></A>administration of any state is said by us to be a citizens of that state; 
<A NAME="75"></A>and, speaking generally, a state is a body of citizens sufficing for the 
<A NAME="76"></A>purposes of life.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="77"></A><B>Part II</B>

<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>But in practice a citizen is defined to be one of whom both the 
<A NAME="79"></A>parents are citizens; others insist on going further back; say to two or 
<A NAME="80"></A>three or more ancestors. This is a short and practical definition but there 
<A NAME="81"></A>are some who raise the further question: How this third or fourth ancestor 
<A NAME="82"></A>came to be a citizen? Gorgias of Leontini, partly because he was in a difficulty, 
<A NAME="83"></A>partly in irony, said- 'Mortars are what is made by the mortar-makers, 
<A NAME="84"></A>and the citizens of Larissa are those who are made by the magistrates; 
<A NAME="85"></A>for it is their trade to make Larissaeans.' Yet the question is really 
<A NAME="86"></A>simple, for, if according to the definition just given they shared in the 
<A NAME="87"></A>government, they were citizens. This is a better definition than the other. 
<A NAME="88"></A>For the words, 'born of a father or mother who is a citizen,' cannot possibly 
<A NAME="89"></A>apply to the first inhabitants or founders of a state.
<A NAME="90"></A><BR><BR>There is a greater difficulty in the case of those who have been 
<A NAME="91"></A>made citizens after a revolution, as by Cleisthenes at Athens after the 
<A NAME="92"></A>expulsion of the tyrants, for he enrolled in tribes many metics, both strangers 
<A NAME="93"></A>and slaves. The doubt in these cases is, not who is, but whether he who 
<A NAME="94"></A>is ought to be a citizen; and there will still be a furthering the state, 
<A NAME="95"></A>whether a certain act is or is not an act of the state; for what ought 
<A NAME="96"></A>not to be is what is false. Now, there are some who hold office, and yet 
<A NAME="97"></A>ought not to hold office, whom we describe as ruling, but ruling unjustly. 
<A NAME="98"></A>And the citizen was defined by the fact of his holding some kind of rule 
<A NAME="99"></A>or office- he who holds a judicial or legislative office fulfills our definition 
<A NAME="100"></A>of a citizen. It is evident, therefore, that the citizens about whom the 
<A NAME="101"></A>doubt has arisen must be called citizens.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="102"></A><B>Part III</B>

<A NAME="103"></A><BR><BR>Whether they ought to be so or not is a question which is bound 
<A NAME="104"></A>up with the previous inquiry. For a parallel question is raised respecting 
<A NAME="105"></A>the state, whether a certain act is or is not an act of the state; for 
<A NAME="106"></A>example, in the transition from an oligarchy or a tyranny to a democracy. 
<A NAME="107"></A>In such cases persons refuse to fulfill their contracts or any other obligations, 
<A NAME="108"></A>on the ground that the tyrant, and not the state, contracted them; they 
<A NAME="109"></A>argue that some constitutions are established by force, and not for the 
<A NAME="110"></A>sake of the common good. But this would apply equally to democracies, for 
<A NAME="111"></A>they too may be founded on violence, and then the acts of the democracy 
<A NAME="112"></A>will be neither more nor less acts of the state in question than those 
<A NAME="113"></A>of an oligarchy or of a tyranny. This question runs up into another: on 
<A NAME="114"></A>what principle shall we ever say that the state is the same, or different? 
<A NAME="115"></A>It would be a very superficial view which considered only the place and 
<A NAME="116"></A>the inhabitants (for the soil and the population may be separated, and 
<A NAME="117"></A>some of the inhabitants may live in one place and some in another). This, 
<A NAME="118"></A>however, is not a very serious difficulty; we need only remark that the 
<A NAME="119"></A>word 'state' is ambiguous.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>It is further asked: When are men, living in the same place, to 
<A NAME="121"></A>be regarded as a single city- what is the limit? Certainly not the wall 
<A NAME="122"></A>of the city, for you might surround all Peloponnesus with a wall. Like 
<A NAME="123"></A>this, we may say, is Babylon, and every city that has the compass of a 
<A NAME="124"></A>nation rather than a city; Babylon, they say, had been taken for three 
<A NAME="125"></A>days before some part of the inhabitants became aware of the fact. This 
<A NAME="126"></A>difficulty may, however, with advantage be deferred to another occasion; 
<A NAME="127"></A>the statesman has to consider the size of the state, and whether it should 
<A NAME="128"></A>consist of more than one nation or not.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>Again, shall we say that while the race of inhabitants, as well 
<A NAME="130"></A>as their place of abode, remain the same, the city is also the same, although 
<A NAME="131"></A>the citizens are always dying and being born, as we call rivers and fountains 
<A NAME="132"></A>the same, although the water is always flowing away and coming again Or 
<A NAME="133"></A>shall we say that the generations of men, like the rivers, are the same, 
<A NAME="134"></A>but that the state changes? For, since the state is a partnership, and 
<A NAME="135"></A>is a partnership of citizens in a constitution, when the form of government 
<A NAME="136"></A>changes, and becomes different, then it may be supposed that the state 
<A NAME="137"></A>is no longer the same, just as a tragic differs from a comic chorus, although 
<A NAME="138"></A>the members of both may be identical. And in this manner we speak of every 
<A NAME="139"></A>union or composition of elements as different when the form of their composition 
<A NAME="140"></A>alters; for example, a scale containing the same sounds is said to be different, 
<A NAME="141"></A>accordingly as the Dorian or the Phrygian mode is employed. And if this 
<A NAME="142"></A>is true it is evident that the sameness of the state consists chiefly in 
<A NAME="143"></A>the sameness of the constitution, and it may be called or not called by 
<A NAME="144"></A>the same name, whether the inhabitants are the same or entirely different. 
<A NAME="145"></A>It is quite another question, whether a state ought or ought not to fulfill 
<A NAME="146"></A>engagements when the form of government changes.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="147"></A><B>Part IV</B>

<A NAME="148"></A><BR><BR>There is a point nearly allied to the preceding: Whether the virtue 
<A NAME="149"></A>of a good man and a good citizen is the same or not. But, before entering 
<A NAME="150"></A>on this discussion, we must certainly first obtain some general notion 
<A NAME="151"></A>of the virtue of the citizen. Like the sailor, the citizen is a member 
<A NAME="152"></A>of a community. Now, sailors have different functions, for one of them 
<A NAME="153"></A>is a rower, another a pilot, and a third a look-out man, a fourth is described 
<A NAME="154"></A>by some similar term; and while the precise definition of each individual's 
<A NAME="155"></A>virtue applies exclusively to him, there is, at the same time, a common 
<A NAME="156"></A>definition applicable to them all. For they have all of them a common object, 
<A NAME="157"></A>which is safety in navigation. Similarly, one citizen differs from another, 
<A NAME="158"></A>but the salvation of the community is the common business of them all. 
<A NAME="159"></A>This community is the constitution; the virtue of the citizen must therefore 
<A NAME="160"></A>be relative to the constitution of which he is a member. If, then, there 
<A NAME="161"></A>are many forms of government, it is evident that there is not one single 
<A NAME="162"></A>virtue of the good citizen which is perfect virtue. But we say that the 
<A NAME="163"></A>good man is he who has one single virtue which is perfect virtue. Hence 
<A NAME="164"></A>it is evident that the good citizen need not of necessity possess the virtue 
<A NAME="165"></A>which makes a good man.
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>The same question may also be approached by another road, from 
<A NAME="167"></A>a consideration of the best constitution. If the state cannot be entirely 
<A NAME="168"></A>composed of good men, and yet each citizen is expected to do his own business 
<A NAME="169"></A>well, and must therefore have virtue, still inasmuch as all the citizens 
<A NAME="170"></A>cannot be alike, the virtue of the citizen and of the good man cannot coincide. 
<A NAME="171"></A>All must have the virtue of the good citizen- thus, and thus only, can 
<A NAME="172"></A>the state be perfect; but they will not have the virtue of a good man, 
<A NAME="173"></A>unless we assume that in the good state all the citizens must be 
<A NAME="174"></A>good.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>Again, the state, as composed of unlikes, may be compared to the 
<A NAME="176"></A>living being: as the first elements into which a living being is resolved 
<A NAME="177"></A>are soul and body, as soul is made up of rational principle and appetite, 
<A NAME="178"></A>the family of husband and wife, property of master and slave, so of all 
<A NAME="179"></A>these, as well as other dissimilar elements, the state is composed; and, 
<A NAME="180"></A>therefore, the virtue of all the citizens cannot possibly be the same, 
<A NAME="181"></A>any more than the excellence of the leader of a chorus is the same as that 
<A NAME="182"></A>of the performer who stands by his side. I have said enough to show why 
<A NAME="183"></A>the two kinds of virtue cannot be absolutely and always the 
<A NAME="184"></A>same.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>But will there then be no case in which the virtue of the good 
<A NAME="186"></A>citizen and the virtue of the good man coincide? To this we answer that 
<A NAME="187"></A>the good ruler is a good and wise man, and that he who would be a statesman 
<A NAME="188"></A>must be a wise man. And some persons say that even the education of the 
<A NAME="189"></A>ruler should be of a special kind; for are not the children of kings instructed 
<A NAME="190"></A>in riding and military exercises? As Euripides says: <BR><BR>"No subtle 
<A NAME="191"></A>arts for me, but what the state requires. "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="192"></A>As though there were a special education needed by a ruler. If then the 
<A NAME="193"></A>virtue of a good ruler is the same as that of a good man, and we assume 
<A NAME="194"></A>further that the subject is a citizen as well as the ruler, the virtue 
<A NAME="195"></A>of the good citizen and the virtue of the good man cannot be absolutely 
<A NAME="196"></A>the same, although in some cases they may; for the virtue of a ruler differs 
<A NAME="197"></A>from that of a citizen. It was the sense of this difference which made 
<A NAME="198"></A>Jason say that 'he felt hungry when he was not a tyrant,' meaning that 
<A NAME="199"></A>he could not endure to live in a private station. But, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="200"></A>it may be argued that men are praised for knowing both how to rule and 
<A NAME="201"></A>how to obey, and he is said to be a citizen of approved virtue who is able 
<A NAME="202"></A>to do both. Now if we suppose the virtue of a good man to be that which 
<A NAME="203"></A>rules, and the virtue of the citizen to include ruling and obeying, it 
<A NAME="204"></A>cannot be said that they are equally worthy of praise. Since, then, it 
<A NAME="205"></A>is sometimes thought that the ruler and the ruled must learn different 
<A NAME="206"></A>things and not the same, but that the citizen must know and share in them 
<A NAME="207"></A>both, the inference is obvious. There is, indeed, the rule of a master, 
<A NAME="208"></A>which is concerned with menial offices- the master need not know how to 
<A NAME="209"></A>perform these, but may employ others in the execution of them: the other 
<A NAME="210"></A>would be degrading; and by the other I mean the power actually to do menial 
<A NAME="211"></A>duties, which vary much in character and are executed by various classes 
<A NAME="212"></A>of slaves, such, for example, as handicraftsmen, who, as their name signifies, 
<A NAME="213"></A>live by the labor of their hands: under these the mechanic is included. 
<A NAME="214"></A>Hence in ancient times, and among some nations, the working classes had 
<A NAME="215"></A>no share in the government- a privilege which they only acquired under 
<A NAME="216"></A>the extreme democracy. Certainly the good man and the statesman and the 
<A NAME="217"></A>good citizen ought not to learn the crafts of inferiors except for their 
<A NAME="218"></A>own occasional use; if they habitually practice them, there will cease 
<A NAME="219"></A>to be a distinction between master and slave.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>This is not the rule of which we are speaking; but there is a rule 
<A NAME="221"></A>of another kind, which is exercised over freemen and equals by birth -a 
<A NAME="222"></A>constitutional rule, which the ruler must learn by obeying, as he would 
<A NAME="223"></A>learn the duties of a general of cavalry by being under the orders of a 
<A NAME="224"></A>general of cavalry, or the duties of a general of infantry by being under 
<A NAME="225"></A>the orders of a general of infantry, and by having had the command of a 
<A NAME="226"></A>regiment and of a company. It has been well said that 'he who has never 
<A NAME="227"></A>learned to obey cannot be a good commander.' The two are not the same, 
<A NAME="228"></A>but the good citizen ought to be capable of both; he should know how to 
<A NAME="229"></A>govern like a freeman, and how to obey like a freeman- these are the virtues 
<A NAME="230"></A>of a citizen. And, although the temperance and justice of a ruler are distinct 
<A NAME="231"></A>from those of a subject, the virtue of a good man will include both; for 
<A NAME="232"></A>the virtue of the good man who is free and also a subject, e.g., his justice, 
<A NAME="233"></A>will not be one but will comprise distinct kinds, the one qualifying him 
<A NAME="234"></A>to rule, the other to obey, and differing as the temperance and courage 
<A NAME="235"></A>of men and women differ. For a man would be thought a coward if he had 
<A NAME="236"></A>no more courage than a courageous woman, and a woman would be thought loquacious 
<A NAME="237"></A>if she imposed no more restraint on her conversation than the good man; 
<A NAME="238"></A>and indeed their part in the management of the household is different, 
<A NAME="239"></A>for the duty of the one is to acquire, and of the other to preserve. Practical 
<A NAME="240"></A>wisdom only is characteristic of the ruler: it would seem that all other 
<A NAME="241"></A>virtues must equally belong to ruler and subject. The virtue of the subject 
<A NAME="242"></A>is certainly not wisdom, but only true opinion; he may be compared to the 
<A NAME="243"></A>maker of the flute, while his master is like the flute-player or user of 
<A NAME="244"></A>the flute.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>From these considerations may be gathered the answer to the question, 
<A NAME="246"></A>whether the virtue of the good man is the same as that of the good citizen, 
<A NAME="247"></A>or different, and how far the same, and how far different.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="248"></A><B>Part V</B>

<A NAME="249"></A><BR><BR>There still remains one more question about the citizen: Is he 
<A NAME="250"></A>only a true citizen who has a share of office, or is the mechanic to be 
<A NAME="251"></A>included? If they who hold no office are to be deemed citizens, not every 
<A NAME="252"></A>citizen can have this virtue of ruling and obeying; for this man is a citizen 
<A NAME="253"></A>And if none of the lower class are citizens, in which part of the state 
<A NAME="254"></A>are they to be placed? For they are not resident aliens, and they are not 
<A NAME="255"></A>foreigners. May we not reply, that as far as this objection goes there 
<A NAME="256"></A>is no more absurdity in excluding them than in excluding slaves and freedmen 
<A NAME="257"></A>from any of the above-mentioned classes? It must be admitted that we cannot 
<A NAME="258"></A>consider all those to be citizens who are necessary to the existence of 
<A NAME="259"></A>the state; for example, children are not citizen equally with grown-up 
<A NAME="260"></A>men, who are citizens absolutely, but children, not being grown up, are 
<A NAME="261"></A>only citizens on a certain assumption. Nay, in ancient times, and among 
<A NAME="262"></A>some nations the artisan class were slaves or foreigners, and therefore 
<A NAME="263"></A>the majority of them are so now. The best form of state will not admit 
<A NAME="264"></A>them to citizenship; but if they are admitted, then our definition of the 
<A NAME="265"></A>virtue of a citizen will not apply to every citizen nor to every free man 
<A NAME="266"></A>as such, but only to those who are freed from necessary services. The necessary 
<A NAME="267"></A>people are either slaves who minister to the wants of individuals, or mechanics 
<A NAME="268"></A>and laborers who are the servants of the community. These reflections carried 
<A NAME="269"></A>a little further will explain their position; and indeed what has been 
<A NAME="270"></A>said already is of itself, when understood, explanation 
<A NAME="271"></A>enough.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>Since there are many forms of government there must be many varieties 
<A NAME="273"></A>of citizen and especially of citizens who are subjects; so that under some 
<A NAME="274"></A>governments the mechanic and the laborer will be citizens, but not in others, 
<A NAME="275"></A>as, for example, in aristocracy or the so-called government of the best 
<A NAME="276"></A>(if there be such an one), in which honors are given according to virtue 
<A NAME="277"></A>and merit; for no man can practice virtue who is living the life of a mechanic 
<A NAME="278"></A>or laborer. In oligarchies the qualification for office is high, and therefore 
<A NAME="279"></A>no laborer can ever be a citizen; but a mechanic may, for an actual majority 
<A NAME="280"></A>of them are rich. At Thebes there was a law that no man could hold office 
<A NAME="281"></A>who had not retired from business for ten years. But in many states the 
<A NAME="282"></A>law goes to the length of admitting aliens; for in some democracies a man 
<A NAME="283"></A>is a citizen though his mother only be a citizen; and a similar principle 
<A NAME="284"></A>is applied to illegitimate children; the law is relaxed when there is a 
<A NAME="285"></A>dearth of population. But when the number of citizens increases, first 
<A NAME="286"></A>the children of a male or a female slave are excluded; then those whose 
<A NAME="287"></A>mothers only are citizens; and at last the right of citizenship is confined 
<A NAME="288"></A>to those whose fathers and mothers are both citizens.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>Hence, as is evident, there are different kinds of citizens; and 
<A NAME="290"></A>he is a citizen in the highest sense who shares in the honors of the state. 
<A NAME="291"></A>Compare Homer's words, 'like some dishonored stranger'; he who is excluded 
<A NAME="292"></A>from the honors of the state is no better than an alien. But when his exclusion 
<A NAME="293"></A>is concealed, then the object is that the privileged class may deceive 
<A NAME="294"></A>their fellow inhabitants.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>As to the question whether the virtue of the good man is the same 
<A NAME="296"></A>as that of the good citizen, the considerations already adduced prove that 
<A NAME="297"></A>in some states the good man and the good citizen are the same, and in others 
<A NAME="298"></A>different. When they are the same it is not every citizen who is a good 
<A NAME="299"></A>man, but only the statesman and those who have or may have, alone or in 
<A NAME="300"></A>conjunction with others, the conduct of public affairs.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="301"></A><B>Part VI</B>

<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>Having determined these questions, we have next to consider whether 
<A NAME="303"></A>there is only one form of government or many, and if many, what they are, 
<A NAME="304"></A>and how many, and what are the differences between them.
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>A constitution is the arrangement of magistracies in a state, especially 
<A NAME="306"></A>of the highest of all. The government is everywhere sovereign in the state, 
<A NAME="307"></A>and the constitution is in fact the government. For example, in democracies 
<A NAME="308"></A>the people are supreme, but in oligarchies, the few; and, therefore, we 
<A NAME="309"></A>say that these two forms of government also are different: and so in other 
<A NAME="310"></A>cases.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>First, let us consider what is the purpose of a state, and how 
<A NAME="312"></A>many forms of government there are by which human society is regulated. 
<A NAME="313"></A>We have already said, in the first part of this treatise, when discussing 
<A NAME="314"></A>household management and the rule of a master, that man is by nature a 
<A NAME="315"></A>political animal. And therefore, men, even when they do not require one 
<A NAME="316"></A>another's help, desire to live together; not but that they are also brought 
<A NAME="317"></A>together by their common interests in proportion as they severally attain 
<A NAME="318"></A>to any measure of well-being. This is certainly the chief end, both of 
<A NAME="319"></A>individuals and of states. And also for the sake of mere life (in which 
<A NAME="320"></A>there is possibly some noble element so long as the evils of existence 
<A NAME="321"></A>do not greatly overbalance the good) mankind meet together and maintain 
<A NAME="322"></A>the political community. And we all see that men cling to life even at 
<A NAME="323"></A>the cost of enduring great misfortune, seeming to find in life a natural 
<A NAME="324"></A>sweetness and happiness.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>There is no difficulty in distinguishing the various kinds of authority; 
<A NAME="326"></A>they have been often defined already in discussions outside the school. 
<A NAME="327"></A>The rule of a master, although the slave by nature and the master by nature 
<A NAME="328"></A>have in reality the same interests, is nevertheless exercised primarily 
<A NAME="329"></A>with a view to the interest of the master, but accidentally considers the 
<A NAME="330"></A>slave, since, if the slave perish, the rule of the master perishes with 
<A NAME="331"></A>him. On the other hand, the government of a wife and children and of a 
<A NAME="332"></A>household, which we have called household management, is exercised in the 
<A NAME="333"></A>first instance for the good of the governed or for the common good of both 
<A NAME="334"></A>parties, but essentially for the good of the governed, as we see to be 
<A NAME="335"></A>the case in medicine, gymnastic, and the arts in general, which are only 
<A NAME="336"></A>accidentally concerned with the good of the artists themselves. For there 
<A NAME="337"></A>is no reason why the trainer may not sometimes practice gymnastics, and 
<A NAME="338"></A>the helmsman is always one of the crew. The trainer or the helmsman considers 
<A NAME="339"></A>the good of those committed to his care. But, when he is one of the persons 
<A NAME="340"></A>taken care of, he accidentally participates in the advantage, for the helmsman 
<A NAME="341"></A>is also a sailor, and the trainer becomes one of those in training. And 
<A NAME="342"></A>so in politics: when the state is framed upon the principle of equality 
<A NAME="343"></A>and likeness, the citizens think that they ought to hold office by turns. 
<A NAME="344"></A>Formerly, as is natural, every one would take his turn of service; and 
<A NAME="345"></A>then again, somebody else would look after his interest, just as he, while 
<A NAME="346"></A>in office, had looked after theirs. But nowadays, for the sake of the advantage 
<A NAME="347"></A>which is to be gained from the public revenues and from office, men want 
<A NAME="348"></A>to be always in office. One might imagine that the rulers, being sickly, 
<A NAME="349"></A>were only kept in health while they continued in office; in that case we 
<A NAME="350"></A>may be sure that they would be hunting after places. The conclusion is 
<A NAME="351"></A>evident: that governments which have a regard to the common interest are 
<A NAME="352"></A>constituted in accordance with strict principles of justice, and are therefore 
<A NAME="353"></A>true forms; but those which regard only the interest of the rulers are 
<A NAME="354"></A>all defective and perverted forms, for they are despotic, whereas a state 
<A NAME="355"></A>is a community of freemen.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="356"></A><B>Part VII</B>

<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>Having determined these points, we have next to consider how many 
<A NAME="358"></A>forms of government there are, and what they are; and in the first place 
<A NAME="359"></A>what are the true forms, for when they are determined the perversions of 
<A NAME="360"></A>them will at once be apparent. The words constitution and government have 
<A NAME="361"></A>the same meaning, and the government, which is the supreme authority in 
<A NAME="362"></A>states, must be in the hands of one, or of a few, or of the many. The true 
<A NAME="363"></A>forms of government, therefore, are those in which the one, or the few, 
<A NAME="364"></A>or the many, govern with a view to the common interest; but governments 
<A NAME="365"></A>which rule with a view to the private interest, whether of the one or of 
<A NAME="366"></A>the few, or of the many, are perversions. For the members of a state, if 
<A NAME="367"></A>they are truly citizens, ought to participate in its advantages. Of forms 
<A NAME="368"></A>of government in which one rules, we call that which regards the common 
<A NAME="369"></A>interests, kingship or royalty; that in which more than one, but not many, 
<A NAME="370"></A>rule, aristocracy; and it is so called, either because the rulers are the 
<A NAME="371"></A>best men, or because they have at heart the best interests of the state 
<A NAME="372"></A>and of the citizens. But when the citizens at large administer the state 
<A NAME="373"></A>for the common interest, the government is called by the generic name- 
<A NAME="374"></A>a constitution. And there is a reason for this use of language. One man 
<A NAME="375"></A>or a few may excel in virtue; but as the number increases it becomes more 
<A NAME="376"></A>difficult for them to attain perfection in every kind of virtue, though 
<A NAME="377"></A>they may in military virtue, for this is found in the masses. Hence in 
<A NAME="378"></A>a constitutional government the fighting-men have the supreme power, and 
<A NAME="379"></A>those who possess arms are the citizens.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>Of the above-mentioned forms, the perversions are as follows: of 
<A NAME="381"></A>royalty, tyranny; of aristocracy, oligarchy; of constitutional government, 
<A NAME="382"></A>democracy. For tyranny is a kind of monarchy which has in view the interest 
<A NAME="383"></A>of the monarch only; oligarchy has in view the interest of the wealthy; 
<A NAME="384"></A>democracy, of the needy: none of them the common good of 
<A NAME="385"></A>all.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="386"></A><B>Part VIII</B>

<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>But there are difficulties about these forms of government, and 
<A NAME="388"></A>it will therefore be necessary to state a little more at length the nature 
<A NAME="389"></A>of each of them. For he who would make a philosophical study of the various 
<A NAME="390"></A>sciences, and does not regard practice only, ought not to overlook or omit 
<A NAME="391"></A>anything, but to set forth the truth in every particular. Tyranny, as I 
<A NAME="392"></A>was saying, is monarchy exercising the rule of a master over the political 
<A NAME="393"></A>society; oligarchy is when men of property have the government in their 
<A NAME="394"></A>hands; democracy, the opposite, when the indigent, and not the men of property, 
<A NAME="395"></A>are the rulers. And here arises the first of our difficulties, and it relates 
<A NAME="396"></A>to the distinction drawn. For democracy is said to be the government of 
<A NAME="397"></A>the many. But what if the many are men of property and have the power in 
<A NAME="398"></A>their hands? In like manner oligarchy is said to be the government of the 
<A NAME="399"></A>few; but what if the poor are fewer than the rich, and have the power in 
<A NAME="400"></A>their hands because they are stronger? In these cases the distinction which 
<A NAME="401"></A>we have drawn between these different forms of government would no longer 
<A NAME="402"></A>hold good.
<A NAME="403"></A><BR><BR>Suppose, once more, that we add wealth to the few and poverty to 
<A NAME="404"></A>the many, and name the governments accordingly- an oligarchy is said to 
<A NAME="405"></A>be that in which the few and the wealthy, and a democracy that in which 
<A NAME="406"></A>the many and the poor are the rulers- there will still be a difficulty. 
<A NAME="407"></A>For, if the only forms of government are the ones already mentioned, how 
<A NAME="408"></A>shall we describe those other governments also just mentioned by us, in 
<A NAME="409"></A>which the rich are the more numerous and the poor are the fewer, and both 
<A NAME="410"></A>govern in their respective states?
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>The argument seems to show that, whether in oligarchies or in democracies, 
<A NAME="412"></A>the number of the governing body, whether the greater number, as in a democracy, 
<A NAME="413"></A>or the smaller number, as in an oligarchy, is an accident due to the fact 
<A NAME="414"></A>that the rich everywhere are few, and the poor numerous. But if so, there 
<A NAME="415"></A>is a misapprehension of the causes of the difference between them. For 
<A NAME="416"></A>the real difference between democracy and oligarchy is poverty and wealth. 
<A NAME="417"></A>Wherever men rule by reason of their wealth, whether they be few or many, 
<A NAME="418"></A>that is an oligarchy, and where the poor rule, that is a democracy. But 
<A NAME="419"></A>as a fact the rich are few and the poor many; for few are well-to-do, whereas 
<A NAME="420"></A>freedom is enjoyed by an, and wealth and freedom are the grounds on which 
<A NAME="421"></A>the oligarchical and democratical parties respectively claim power in the 
<A NAME="422"></A>state.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="423"></A><B>Part IX</B>

<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>Let us begin by considering the common definitions of oligarchy 
<A NAME="425"></A>and democracy, and what is justice oligarchical and democratical. For all 
<A NAME="426"></A>men cling to justice of some kind, but their conceptions are imperfect 
<A NAME="427"></A>and they do not express the whole idea. For example, justice is thought 
<A NAME="428"></A>by them to be, and is, equality, not. however, for however, for but only 
<A NAME="429"></A>for equals. And inequality is thought to be, and is, justice; neither is 
<A NAME="430"></A>this for all, but only for unequals. When the persons are omitted, then 
<A NAME="431"></A>men judge erroneously. The reason is that they are passing judgment on 
<A NAME="432"></A>themselves, and most people are bad judges in their own case. And whereas 
<A NAME="433"></A>justice implies a relation to persons as well as to things, and a just 
<A NAME="434"></A>distribution, as I have already said in the Ethics, implies the same ratio 
<A NAME="435"></A>between the persons and between the things, they agree about the equality 
<A NAME="436"></A>of the things, but dispute about the equality of the persons, chiefly for 
<A NAME="437"></A>the reason which I have just given- because they are bad judges in their 
<A NAME="438"></A>own affairs; and secondly, because both the parties to the argument are 
<A NAME="439"></A>speaking of a limited and partial justice, but imagine themselves to be 
<A NAME="440"></A>speaking of absolute justice. For the one party, if they are unequal in 
<A NAME="441"></A>one respect, for example wealth, consider themselves to be unequal in all; 
<A NAME="442"></A>and the other party, if they are equal in one respect, for example free 
<A NAME="443"></A>birth, consider themselves to be equal in all. But they leave out the capital 
<A NAME="444"></A>point. For if men met and associated out of regard to wealth only, their 
<A NAME="445"></A>share in the state would be proportioned to their property, and the oligarchical 
<A NAME="446"></A>doctrine would then seem to carry the day. It would not be just that he 
<A NAME="447"></A>who paid one mina should have the same share of a hundred minae, whether 
<A NAME="448"></A>of the principal or of the profits, as he who paid the remaining ninety-nine. 
<A NAME="449"></A>But a state exists for the sake of a good life, and not for the sake of 
<A NAME="450"></A>life only: if life only were the object, slaves and brute animals might 
<A NAME="451"></A>form a state, but they cannot, for they have no share in happiness or in 
<A NAME="452"></A>a life of free choice. Nor does a state exist for the sake of alliance 
<A NAME="453"></A>and security from injustice, nor yet for the sake of exchange and mutual 
<A NAME="454"></A>intercourse; for then the Tyrrhenians and the Carthaginians, and all who 
<A NAME="455"></A>have commercial treaties with one another, would be the citizens of one 
<A NAME="456"></A>state. True, they have agreements about imports, and engagements that they 
<A NAME="457"></A>will do no wrong to one another, and written articles of alliance. But 
<A NAME="458"></A>there are no magistrates common to the contracting parties who will enforce 
<A NAME="459"></A>their engagements; different states have each their own magistracies. Nor 
<A NAME="460"></A>does one state take care that the citizens of the other are such as they 
<A NAME="461"></A>ought to be, nor see that those who come under the terms of the treaty 
<A NAME="462"></A>do no wrong or wickedness at an, but only that they do no injustice to 
<A NAME="463"></A>one another. Whereas, those who care for good government take into consideration 
<A NAME="464"></A>virtue and vice in states. Whence it may be further inferred that virtue 
<A NAME="465"></A>must be the care of a state which is truly so called, and not merely enjoys 
<A NAME="466"></A>the name: for without this end the community becomes a mere alliance which 
<A NAME="467"></A>differs only in place from alliances of which the members live apart; and 
<A NAME="468"></A>law is only a convention, 'a surety to one another of justice,' as the 
<A NAME="469"></A>sophist Lycophron says, and has no real power to make the 
<A NAME="470"></A>citizens
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>This is obvious; for suppose distinct places, such as Corinth and 
<A NAME="472"></A>Megara, to be brought together so that their walls touched, still they 
<A NAME="473"></A>would not be one city, not even if the citizens had the right to intermarry, 
<A NAME="474"></A>which is one of the rights peculiarly characteristic of states. Again, 
<A NAME="475"></A>if men dwelt at a distance from one another, but not so far off as to have 
<A NAME="476"></A>no intercourse, and there were laws among them that they should not wrong 
<A NAME="477"></A>each other in their exchanges, neither would this be a state. Let us suppose 
<A NAME="478"></A>that one man is a carpenter, another a husbandman, another a shoemaker, 
<A NAME="479"></A>and so on, and that their number is ten thousand: nevertheless, if they 
<A NAME="480"></A>have nothing in common but exchange, alliance, and the like, that would 
<A NAME="481"></A>not constitute a state. Why is this? Surely not because they are at a distance 
<A NAME="482"></A>from one another: for even supposing that such a community were to meet 
<A NAME="483"></A>in one place, but that each man had a house of his own, which was in a 
<A NAME="484"></A>manner his state, and that they made alliance with one another, but only 
<A NAME="485"></A>against evil-doers; still an accurate thinker would not deem this to be 
<A NAME="486"></A>a state, if their intercourse with one another was of the same character 
<A NAME="487"></A>after as before their union. It is clear then that a state is not a mere 
<A NAME="488"></A>society, having a common place, established for the prevention of mutual 
<A NAME="489"></A>crime and for the sake of exchange. These are conditions without which 
<A NAME="490"></A>a state cannot exist; but all of them together do not constitute a state, 
<A NAME="491"></A>which is a community of families and aggregations of families in well-being, 
<A NAME="492"></A>for the sake of a perfect and self-sufficing life. Such a community can 
<A NAME="493"></A>only be established among those who live in the same place and intermarry. 
<A NAME="494"></A>Hence arise in cities family connections, brotherhoods, common sacrifices, 
<A NAME="495"></A>amusements which draw men together. But these are created by friendship, 
<A NAME="496"></A>for the will to live together is friendship. The end of the state is the 
<A NAME="497"></A>good life, and these are the means towards it. And the state is the union 
<A NAME="498"></A>of families and villages in a perfect and self-sufficing life, by which 
<A NAME="499"></A>we mean a happy and honorable life.
<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>Our conclusion, then, is that political society exists for the 
<A NAME="501"></A>sake of noble actions, and not of mere companionship. Hence they who contribute 
<A NAME="502"></A>most to such a society have a greater share in it than those who have the 
<A NAME="503"></A>same or a greater freedom or nobility of birth but are inferior to them 
<A NAME="504"></A>in political virtue; or than those who exceed them in wealth but are surpassed 
<A NAME="505"></A>by them in virtue.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>From what has been said it will be clearly seen that all the partisans 
<A NAME="507"></A>of different forms of government speak of a part of justice 
<A NAME="508"></A>only.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="509"></A><B>Part X</B>

<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>There is also a doubt as to what is to be the supreme power in 
<A NAME="511"></A>the state: Is it the multitude? Or the wealthy? Or the good? Or the one 
<A NAME="512"></A>best man? Or a tyrant? Any of these alternatives seems to involve disagreeable 
<A NAME="513"></A>consequences. If the poor, for example, because they are more in number, 
<A NAME="514"></A>divide among themselves the property of the rich- is not this unjust? No, 
<A NAME="515"></A>by heaven (will be the reply), for the supreme authority justly willed 
<A NAME="516"></A>it. But if this is not injustice, pray what is? Again, when in the first 
<A NAME="517"></A>division all has been taken, and the majority divide anew the property 
<A NAME="518"></A>of the minority, is it not evident, if this goes on, that they will ruin 
<A NAME="519"></A>the state? Yet surely, virtue is not the ruin of those who possess her, 
<A NAME="520"></A>nor is justice destructive of a state; and therefore this law of confiscation 
<A NAME="521"></A>clearly cannot be just. If it were, all the acts of a tyrant must of necessity 
<A NAME="522"></A>be just; for he only coerces other men by superior power, just as the multitude 
<A NAME="523"></A>coerce the rich. But is it just then that the few and the wealthy should 
<A NAME="524"></A>be the rulers? And what if they, in like manner, rob and plunder the people- 
<A NAME="525"></A>is this just? if so, the other case will likewise be just. But there can 
<A NAME="526"></A>be no doubt that all these things are wrong and unjust.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>Then ought the good to rule and have supreme power? But in that 
<A NAME="528"></A>case everybody else, being excluded from power, will be dishonored. For 
<A NAME="529"></A>the offices of a state are posts of honor; and if one set of men always 
<A NAME="530"></A>holds them, the rest must be deprived of them. Then will it be well that 
<A NAME="531"></A>the one best man should rule? Nay, that is still more oligarchical, for 
<A NAME="532"></A>the number of those who are dishonored is thereby increased. Some one may 
<A NAME="533"></A>say that it is bad in any case for a man, subject as he is to all the accidents 
<A NAME="534"></A>of human passion, to have the supreme power, rather than the law. But what 
<A NAME="535"></A>if the law itself be democratical or oligarchical, how will that help us 
<A NAME="536"></A>out of our difficulties? Not at all; the same consequences will 
<A NAME="537"></A>follow.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="538"></A><B>Part XI</B>

<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>Most of these questions may be reserved for another occasion. The 
<A NAME="540"></A>principle that the multitude ought to be supreme rather than the few best 
<A NAME="541"></A>is one that is maintained, and, though not free from difficulty, yet seems 
<A NAME="542"></A>to contain an element of truth. For the many, of whom each individual is 
<A NAME="543"></A>but an ordinary person, when they meet together may very likely be better 
<A NAME="544"></A>than the few good, if regarded not individually but collectively, just 
<A NAME="545"></A>as a feast to which many contribute is better than a dinner provided out 
<A NAME="546"></A>of a single purse. For each individual among the many has a share of virtue 
<A NAME="547"></A>and prudence, and when they meet together, they become in a manner one 
<A NAME="548"></A>man, who has many feet, and hands, and senses; that is a figure of their 
<A NAME="549"></A>mind and disposition. Hence the many are better judges than a single man 
<A NAME="550"></A>of music and poetry; for some understand one part, and some another, and 
<A NAME="551"></A>among them they understand the whole. There is a similar combination of 
<A NAME="552"></A>qualities in good men, who differ from any individual of the many, as the 
<A NAME="553"></A>beautiful are said to differ from those who are not beautiful, and works 
<A NAME="554"></A>of art from realities, because in them the scattered elements are combined, 
<A NAME="555"></A>although, if taken separately, the eye of one person or some other feature 
<A NAME="556"></A>in another person would be fairer than in the picture. Whether this principle 
<A NAME="557"></A>can apply to every democracy, and to all bodies of men, is not clear. Or 
<A NAME="558"></A>rather, by heaven, in some cases it is impossible of application; for the 
<A NAME="559"></A>argument would equally hold about brutes; and wherein, it will be asked, 
<A NAME="560"></A>do some men differ from brutes? But there may be bodies of men about whom 
<A NAME="561"></A>our statement is nevertheless true. And if so, the difficulty which has 
<A NAME="562"></A>been already raised, and also another which is akin to it -viz., what power 
<A NAME="563"></A>should be assigned to the mass of freemen and citizens, who are not rich 
<A NAME="564"></A>and have no personal merit- are both solved. There is still a danger in 
<A NAME="565"></A>aflowing them to share the great offices of state, for their folly will 
<A NAME="566"></A>lead them into error, and their dishonesty into crime. But there is a danger 
<A NAME="567"></A>also in not letting them share, for a state in which many poor men are 
<A NAME="568"></A>excluded from office will necessarily be full of enemies. The only way 
<A NAME="569"></A>of escape is to assign to them some deliberative and judicial functions. 
<A NAME="570"></A>For this reason Solon and certain other legislators give them the power 
<A NAME="571"></A>of electing to offices, and of calling the magistrates to account, but 
<A NAME="572"></A>they do not allow them to hold office singly. When they meet together their 
<A NAME="573"></A>perceptions are quite good enough, and combined with the better class they 
<A NAME="574"></A>are useful to the state (just as impure food when mixed with what is pure 
<A NAME="575"></A>sometimes makes the entire mass more wholesome than a small quantity of 
<A NAME="576"></A>the pure would be), but each individual, left to himself, forms an imperfect 
<A NAME="577"></A>judgment. On the other hand, the popular form of government involves certain 
<A NAME="578"></A>difficulties. In the first place, it might be objected that he who can 
<A NAME="579"></A>judge of the healing of a sick man would be one who could himself heal 
<A NAME="580"></A>his disease, and make him whole- that is, in other words, the physician; 
<A NAME="581"></A>and so in all professions and arts. As, then, the physician ought to be 
<A NAME="582"></A>called to account by physicians, so ought men in general to be called to 
<A NAME="583"></A>account by their peers. But physicians are of three kinds: there is the 
<A NAME="584"></A>ordinary practitioner, and there is the physician of the higher class, 
<A NAME="585"></A>and thirdly the intelligent man who has studied the art: in all arts there 
<A NAME="586"></A>is such a class; and we attribute the power of judging to them quite as 
<A NAME="587"></A>much as to professors of the art. Secondly, does not the same principle 
<A NAME="588"></A>apply to elections? For a right election can only be made by those who 
<A NAME="589"></A>have knowledge; those who know geometry, for example, will choose a geometrician 
<A NAME="590"></A>rightly, and those who know how to steer, a pilot; and, even if there be 
<A NAME="591"></A>some occupations and arts in which private persons share in the ability 
<A NAME="592"></A>to choose, they certainly cannot choose better than those who know. So 
<A NAME="593"></A>that, according to this argument, neither the election of magistrates, 
<A NAME="594"></A>nor the calling of them to account, should be entrusted to the many. Yet 
<A NAME="595"></A>possibly these objections are to a great extent met by our old answer, 
<A NAME="596"></A>that if the people are not utterly degraded, although individually they 
<A NAME="597"></A>may be worse judges than those who have special knowledge- as a body they 
<A NAME="598"></A>are as good or better. Moreover, there are some arts whose products are 
<A NAME="599"></A>not judged of solely, or best, by the artists themselves, namely those 
<A NAME="600"></A>arts whose products are recognized even by those who do not possess the 
<A NAME="601"></A>art; for example, the knowledge of the house is not limited to the builder 
<A NAME="602"></A>only; the user, or, in other words, the master, of the house will be even 
<A NAME="603"></A>a better judge than the builder, just as the pilot will judge better of 
<A NAME="604"></A>a rudder than the carpenter, and the guest will judge better of a feast 
<A NAME="605"></A>than the cook.
<A NAME="606"></A><BR><BR>This difficulty seems now to be sufficiently answered, but there 
<A NAME="607"></A>is another akin to it. That inferior persons should have authority in greater 
<A NAME="608"></A>matters than the good would appear to be a strange thing, yet the election 
<A NAME="609"></A>and calling to account of the magistrates is the greatest of all. And these, 
<A NAME="610"></A>as I was saying, are functions which in some states are assigned to the 
<A NAME="611"></A>people, for the assembly is supreme in all such matters. Yet persons of 
<A NAME="612"></A>any age, and having but a small property qualification, sit in the assembly 
<A NAME="613"></A>and deliberate and judge, although for the great officers of state, such 
<A NAME="614"></A>as treasurers and generals, a high qualification is required. This difficulty 
<A NAME="615"></A>may be solved in the same manner as the preceding, and the present practice 
<A NAME="616"></A>of democracies may be really defensible. For the power does not reside 
<A NAME="617"></A>in the dicast, or senator, or ecclesiast, but in the court, and the senate, 
<A NAME="618"></A>and the assembly, of which individual senators, or ecclesiasts, or dicasts, 
<A NAME="619"></A>are only parts or members. And for this reason the many may claim to have 
<A NAME="620"></A>a higher authority than the few; for the people, and the senate, and the 
<A NAME="621"></A>courts consist of many persons, and their property collectively is greater 
<A NAME="622"></A>than the property of one or of a few individuals holding great offices. 
<A NAME="623"></A>But enough of this.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>The discussion of the first question shows nothing so clearly as 
<A NAME="625"></A>that laws, when good, should be supreme; and that the magistrate or magistrates 
<A NAME="626"></A>should regulate those matters only on which the laws are unable to speak 
<A NAME="627"></A>with precision owing to the difficulty of any general principle embracing 
<A NAME="628"></A>all particulars. But what are good laws has not yet been clearly explained; 
<A NAME="629"></A>the old difficulty remains. The goodness or badness, justice or injustice, 
<A NAME="630"></A>of laws varies of necessity with the constitutions of states. This, however, 
<A NAME="631"></A>is clear, that the laws must be adapted to the constitutions. But if so, 
<A NAME="632"></A>true forms of government will of necessity have just laws, and perverted 
<A NAME="633"></A>forms of government will have unjust laws.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="634"></A><B>Part XII</B>

<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>In all sciences and arts the end is a good, and the greatest good 
<A NAME="636"></A>and in the highest degree a good in the most authoritative of all- this 
<A NAME="637"></A>is the political science of which the good is justice, in other words, 
<A NAME="638"></A>the common interest. All men think justice to be a sort of equality; and 
<A NAME="639"></A>to a certain extent they agree in the philosophical distinctions which 
<A NAME="640"></A>have been laid down by us about Ethics. For they admit that justice is 
<A NAME="641"></A>a thing and has a relation to persons, and that equals ought to have equality. 
<A NAME="642"></A>But there still remains a question: equality or inequality of what? Here 
<A NAME="643"></A>is a difficulty which calls for political speculation. For very likely 
<A NAME="644"></A>some persons will say that offices of state ought to be unequally distributed 
<A NAME="645"></A>according to superior excellence, in whatever respect, of the citizen, 
<A NAME="646"></A>although there is no other difference between him and the rest of the community; 
<A NAME="647"></A>for that those who differ in any one respect have different rights and 
<A NAME="648"></A>claims. But, surely, if this is true, the complexion or height of a man, 
<A NAME="649"></A>or any other advantage, will be a reason for his obtaining a greater share 
<A NAME="650"></A>of political rights. The error here lies upon the surface, and may be illustrated 
<A NAME="651"></A>from the other arts and sciences. When a number of flute players are equal 
<A NAME="652"></A>in their art, there is no reason why those of them who are better born 
<A NAME="653"></A>should have better flutes given to them; for they will not play any better 
<A NAME="654"></A>on the flute, and the superior instrument should be reserved for him who 
<A NAME="655"></A>is the superior artist. If what I am saying is still obscure, it will be 
<A NAME="656"></A>made clearer as we proceed. For if there were a superior flute-player who 
<A NAME="657"></A>was far inferior in birth and beauty, although either of these may be a 
<A NAME="658"></A>greater good than the art of flute-playing, and may excel flute-playing 
<A NAME="659"></A>in a greater ratio than he excels the others in his art, still he ought 
<A NAME="660"></A>to have the best flutes given to him, unless the advantages of wealth and 
<A NAME="661"></A>birth contribute to excellence in flute-playing, which they do not. Moreover, 
<A NAME="662"></A>upon this principle any good may be compared with any other. For if a given 
<A NAME="663"></A>height may be measured wealth and against freedom, height in general may 
<A NAME="664"></A>be so measured. Thus if A excels in height more than B in virtue, even 
<A NAME="665"></A>if virtue in general excels height still more, all goods will be commensurable; 
<A NAME="666"></A>for if a certain amount is better than some other, it is clear that some 
<A NAME="667"></A>other will be equal. But since no such comparison can be made, it is evident 
<A NAME="668"></A>that there is good reason why in politics men do not ground their claim 
<A NAME="669"></A>to office on every sort of inequality any more than in the arts. For if 
<A NAME="670"></A>some be slow, and others swift, that is no reason why the one should have 
<A NAME="671"></A>little and the others much; it is in gymnastics contests that such excellence 
<A NAME="672"></A>is rewarded. Whereas the rival claims of candidates for office can only 
<A NAME="673"></A>be based on the possession of elements which enter into the composition 
<A NAME="674"></A>of a state. And therefore the noble, or free-born, or rich, may with good 
<A NAME="675"></A>reason claim office; for holders of offices must be freemen and taxpayers: 
<A NAME="676"></A>a state can be no more composed entirely of poor men than entirely of slaves. 
<A NAME="677"></A>But if wealth and freedom are necessary elements, justice and valor are 
<A NAME="678"></A>equally so; for without the former qualities a state cannot exist at all, 
<A NAME="679"></A>without the latter not well.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="680"></A><B>Part XIII</B>

<A NAME="681"></A><BR><BR>If the existence of the state is alone to be considered, then it 
<A NAME="682"></A>would seem that all, or some at least, of these claims are just; but, if 
<A NAME="683"></A>we take into account a good life, then, as I have already said, education 
<A NAME="684"></A>and virtue have superior claims. As, however, those who are equal in one 
<A NAME="685"></A>thing ought not to have an equal share in all, nor those who are unequal 
<A NAME="686"></A>in one thing to have an unequal share in all, it is certain that all forms 
<A NAME="687"></A>of government which rest on either of these principles are perversions. 
<A NAME="688"></A>All men have a claim in a certain sense, as I have already admitted, but 
<A NAME="689"></A>all have not an absolute claim. The rich claim because they have a greater 
<A NAME="690"></A>share in the land, and land is the common element of the state; also they 
<A NAME="691"></A>are generally more trustworthy in contracts. The free claim under the same 
<A NAME="692"></A>tide as the noble; for they are nearly akin. For the noble are citizens 
<A NAME="693"></A>in a truer sense than the ignoble, and good birth is always valued in a 
<A NAME="694"></A>man's own home and country. Another reason is, that those who are sprung 
<A NAME="695"></A>from better ancestors are likely to be better men, for nobility is excellence 
<A NAME="696"></A>of race. Virtue, too, may be truly said to have a claim, for justice has 
<A NAME="697"></A>been acknowledged by us to be a social virtue, and it implies all others. 
<A NAME="698"></A>Again, the many may urge their claim against the few; for, when taken collectively, 
<A NAME="699"></A>and compared with the few, they are stronger and richer and better. But, 
<A NAME="700"></A>what if the good, the rich, the noble, and the other classes who make up 
<A NAME="701"></A>a state, are all living together in the same city, Will there, or will 
<A NAME="702"></A>there not, be any doubt who shall rule? No doubt at all in determining 
<A NAME="703"></A>who ought to rule in each of the above-mentioned forms of government. For 
<A NAME="704"></A>states are characterized by differences in their governing bodies-one of 
<A NAME="705"></A>them has a government of the rich, another of the virtuous, and so on. 
<A NAME="706"></A>But a difficulty arises when all these elements co-exist. How are we to 
<A NAME="707"></A>decide? Suppose the virtuous to be very few in number: may we consider 
<A NAME="708"></A>their numbers in relation to their duties, and ask whether they are enough 
<A NAME="709"></A>to administer the state, or so many as will make up a state? Objections 
<A NAME="710"></A>may be urged against all the aspirants to political power. For those who 
<A NAME="711"></A>found their claims on wealth or family might be thought to have no basis 
<A NAME="712"></A>of justice; on this principle, if any one person were richer than all the 
<A NAME="713"></A>rest, it is clear that he ought to be ruler of them. In like manner he 
<A NAME="714"></A>who is very distinguished by his birth ought to have the superiority over 
<A NAME="715"></A>all those who claim on the ground that they are freeborn. In an aristocracy, 
<A NAME="716"></A>or government of the best, a like difficulty occurs about virtue; for if 
<A NAME="717"></A>one citizen be better than the other members of the government, however 
<A NAME="718"></A>good they may be, he too, upon the same principle of justice, should rule 
<A NAME="719"></A>over them. And if the people are to be supreme because they are stronger 
<A NAME="720"></A>than the few, then if one man, or more than one, but not a majority, is 
<A NAME="721"></A>stronger than the many, they ought to rule, and not the 
<A NAME="722"></A>many.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>All these considerations appear to show that none of the principles 
<A NAME="724"></A>on which men claim to rule and to hold all other men in subjection to them 
<A NAME="725"></A>are strictly right. To those who claim to be masters of the government 
<A NAME="726"></A>on the ground of their virtue or their wealth, the many might fairly answer 
<A NAME="727"></A>that they themselves are often better and richer than the few- I do not 
<A NAME="728"></A>say individually, but collectively. And another ingenious objection which 
<A NAME="729"></A>is sometimes put forward may be met in a similar manner. Some persons doubt 
<A NAME="730"></A>whether the legislator who desires to make the justest laws ought to legislate 
<A NAME="731"></A>with a view to the good of the higher classes or of the many, when the 
<A NAME="732"></A>case which we have mentioned occurs. Now what is just or right is to be 
<A NAME="733"></A>interpreted in the sense of 'what is equal'; and that which is right in 
<A NAME="734"></A>the sense of being equal is to be considered with reference to the advantage 
<A NAME="735"></A>of the state, and the common good of the citizens. And a citizen is one 
<A NAME="736"></A>who shares in governing and being governed. He differs under different 
<A NAME="737"></A>forms of government, but in the best state he is one who is able and willing 
<A NAME="738"></A>to be governed and to govern with a view to the life of 
<A NAME="739"></A>virtue.
<A NAME="740"></A><BR><BR>If, however, there be some one person, or more than one, although 
<A NAME="741"></A>not enough to make up the full complement of a state, whose virtue is so 
<A NAME="742"></A>pre-eminent that the virtues or the political capacity of all the rest 
<A NAME="743"></A>admit of no comparison with his or theirs, he or they can be no longer 
<A NAME="744"></A>regarded as part of a state; for justice will not be done to the superior, 
<A NAME="745"></A>if he is reckoned only as the equal of those who are so far inferior to 
<A NAME="746"></A>him in virtue and in political capacity. Such an one may truly be deemed 
<A NAME="747"></A>a God among men. Hence we see that legislation is necessarily concerned 
<A NAME="748"></A>only with those who are equal in birth and in capacity; and that for men 
<A NAME="749"></A>of pre-eminent virtue there is no law- they are themselves a law. Any would 
<A NAME="750"></A>be ridiculous who attempted to make laws for them: they would probably 
<A NAME="751"></A>retort what, in the fable of Antisthenes, the lions said to the hares, 
<A NAME="752"></A>when in the council of the beasts the latter began haranguing and claiming 
<A NAME="753"></A>equality for all. And for this reason democratic states have instituted 
<A NAME="754"></A>ostracism; equality is above all things their aim, and therefore they ostracized 
<A NAME="755"></A>and banished from the city for a time those who seemed to predominate too 
<A NAME="756"></A>much through their wealth, or the number of their friends, or through any 
<A NAME="757"></A>other political influence. Mythology tells us that the Argonauts left Heracles 
<A NAME="758"></A>behind for a similar reason; the ship Argo would not take him because she 
<A NAME="759"></A>feared that he would have been too much for the rest of the crew. Wherefore 
<A NAME="760"></A>those who denounce tyranny and blame the counsel which Periander gave to 
<A NAME="761"></A>Thrasybulus cannot be held altogether just in their censure. The story 
<A NAME="762"></A>is that Periander, when the herald was sent to ask counsel of him, said 
<A NAME="763"></A>nothing, but only cut off the tallest ears of corn till he had brought 
<A NAME="764"></A>the field to a level. The herald did not know the meaning of the action, 
<A NAME="765"></A>but came and reported what he had seen to Thrasybulus, who understood that 
<A NAME="766"></A>he was to cut off the principal men in the state; and this is a policy 
<A NAME="767"></A>not only expedient for tyrants or in practice confined to them, but equally 
<A NAME="768"></A>necessary in oligarchies and democracies. Ostracism is a measure of the 
<A NAME="769"></A>same kind, which acts by disabling and banishing the most prominent citizens. 
<A NAME="770"></A>Great powers do the same to whole cities and nations, as the Athenians 
<A NAME="771"></A>did to the Samians, Chians, and Lesbians; no sooner had they obtained a 
<A NAME="772"></A>firm grasp of the empire, than they humbled their allies contrary to treaty; 
<A NAME="773"></A>and the Persian king has repeatedly crushed the Medes, Babylonians, and 
<A NAME="774"></A>other nations, when their spirit has been stirred by the recollection of 
<A NAME="775"></A>their former greatness.
<A NAME="776"></A><BR><BR>The problem is a universal one, and equally concerns all forms 
<A NAME="777"></A>of government, true as well as false; for, although perverted forms with 
<A NAME="778"></A>a view to their own interests may adopt this policy, those which seek the 
<A NAME="779"></A>common interest do so likewise. The same thing may be observed in the arts 
<A NAME="780"></A>and sciences; for the painter will not allow the figure to have a foot 
<A NAME="781"></A>which, however beautiful, is not in proportion, nor will the shipbuilder 
<A NAME="782"></A>allow the stem or any other part of the vessel to be unduly large, any 
<A NAME="783"></A>more than the chorus-master will allow any one who sings louder or better 
<A NAME="784"></A>than all the rest to sing in the choir. Monarchs, too, may practice compulsion 
<A NAME="785"></A>and still live in harmony with their cities, if their own government is 
<A NAME="786"></A>for the interest of the state. Hence where there is an acknowledged superiority 
<A NAME="787"></A>the argument in favor of ostracism is based upon a kind of political justice. 
<A NAME="788"></A>It would certainly be better that the legislator should from the first 
<A NAME="789"></A>so order his state as to have no need of such a remedy. But if the need 
<A NAME="790"></A>arises, the next best thing is that he should endeavor to correct the evil 
<A NAME="791"></A>by this or some similar measure. The principle, however, has not been fairly 
<A NAME="792"></A>applied in states; for, instead of looking to the good of their own constitution, 
<A NAME="793"></A>they have used ostracism for factious purposes. It is true that under perverted 
<A NAME="794"></A>forms of government, and from their special point of view, such a measure 
<A NAME="795"></A>is just and expedient, but it is also clear that it is not absolutely just. 
<A NAME="796"></A>In the perfect state there would be great doubts about the use of it, not 
<A NAME="797"></A>when applied to excess in strength, wealth, popularity, or the like, but 
<A NAME="798"></A>when used against some one who is pre-eminent in virtue- what is to be 
<A NAME="799"></A>done with him? Mankind will not say that such an one is to be expelled 
<A NAME="800"></A>and exiled; on the other hand, he ought not to be a subject- that would 
<A NAME="801"></A>be as if mankind should claim to rule over Zeus, dividing his offices among 
<A NAME="802"></A>them. The only alternative is that all should joyfully obey such a ruler, 
<A NAME="803"></A>according to what seems to be the order of nature, and that men like him 
<A NAME="804"></A>should be kings in their state for life.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="805"></A><B>Part XIV</B>

<A NAME="806"></A><BR><BR>The preceding discussion, by a natural transition, leads to the 
<A NAME="807"></A>consideration of royalty, which we admit to be one of the true forms of 
<A NAME="808"></A>government. Let us see whether in order to be well governed a state or 
<A NAME="809"></A>country should be under the rule of a king or under some other form of 
<A NAME="810"></A>government; and whether monarchy, although good for some, may not be bad 
<A NAME="811"></A>for others. But first we must determine whether there is one species of 
<A NAME="812"></A>royalty or many. It is easy to see that there are many, and that the manner 
<A NAME="813"></A>of government is not the same in all of them.
<A NAME="814"></A><BR><BR>Of royalties according to law, (1) the Lacedaemonian is thought 
<A NAME="815"></A>to answer best to the true pattern; but there the royal power is not absolute, 
<A NAME="816"></A>except when the kings go on an expedition, and then they take the command. 
<A NAME="817"></A>Matters of religion are likewise committed to them. The kingly office is 
<A NAME="818"></A>in truth a kind of generalship, irresponsible and perpetual. The king has 
<A NAME="819"></A>not the power of life and death, except in a specified case, as for instance, 
<A NAME="820"></A>in ancient times, he had it when upon a campaign, by right of force. This 
<A NAME="821"></A>custom is described in Homer. For Agamemnon is patient when he is attacked 
<A NAME="822"></A>in the assembly, but when the army goes out to battle he has the power 
<A NAME="823"></A>even of life and death. Does he not say- 'When I find a man skulking apart 
<A NAME="824"></A>from the battle, nothing shall save him from the dogs and vultures, for 
<A NAME="825"></A>in my hands is death'?
<A NAME="826"></A><BR><BR>This, then, is one form of royalty-a generalship for life: and 
<A NAME="827"></A>of such royalties some are hereditary and others elective.
<A NAME="828"></A><BR><BR>(2) There is another sort of monarchy not uncommon among the barbarians, 
<A NAME="829"></A>which nearly resembles tyranny. But this is both legal and hereditary. 
<A NAME="830"></A>For barbarians, being more servile in character than Hellenes, and Asiadics 
<A NAME="831"></A>than Europeans, do not rebel against a despotic government. Such royalties 
<A NAME="832"></A>have the nature of tyrannies because the people are by nature slaves; but 
<A NAME="833"></A>there is no danger of their being overthrown, for they are hereditary and 
<A NAME="834"></A>legal. Wherefore also their guards are such as a king and not such as a 
<A NAME="835"></A>tyrant would employ, that is to say, they are composed of citizens, whereas 
<A NAME="836"></A>the guards of tyrants are mercenaries. For kings rule according to law 
<A NAME="837"></A>over voluntary subjects, but tyrants over involuntary; and the one are 
<A NAME="838"></A>guarded by their fellow-citizens the others are guarded against 
<A NAME="839"></A>them.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR>These are two forms of monarchy, and there was a third (3) which 
<A NAME="841"></A>existed in ancient Hellas, called an Aesymnetia or dictatorship. This may 
<A NAME="842"></A>be defined generally as an elective tyranny, which, like the barbarian 
<A NAME="843"></A>monarchy, is legal, but differs from it in not being hereditary. Sometimes 
<A NAME="844"></A>the office was held for life, sometimes for a term of years, or until certain 
<A NAME="845"></A>duties had been performed. For example, the Mytilenaeans elected Pittacus 
<A NAME="846"></A>leader against the exiles, who were headed by Antimenides and Alcaeus the 
<A NAME="847"></A>poet. And Alcaeus himself shows in one of his banquet odes that they chose 
<A NAME="848"></A>Pittacus tyrant, for he reproaches his fellow-citizens for 'having made 
<A NAME="849"></A>the low-born Pittacus tyrant of the spiritless and ill-fated city, with 
<A NAME="850"></A>one voice shouting his praises.'
<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR>These forms of government have always had the character of tyrannies, 
<A NAME="852"></A>because they possess despotic power; but inasmuch as they are elective 
<A NAME="853"></A>and acquiesced in by their subjects, they are kingly.
<A NAME="854"></A><BR><BR>(4) There is a fourth species of kingly rule- that of the heroic 
<A NAME="855"></A>times- which was hereditary and legal, and was exercised over willing subjects. 
<A NAME="856"></A>For the first chiefs were benefactors of the people in arts or arms; they 
<A NAME="857"></A>either gathered them into a community, or procured land for them; and thus 
<A NAME="858"></A>they became kings of voluntary subjects, and their power was inherited 
<A NAME="859"></A>by their descendants. They took the command in war and presided over the 
<A NAME="860"></A>sacrifices, except those which required a priest. They also decided causes 
<A NAME="861"></A>either with or without an oath; and when they swore, the form of the oath 
<A NAME="862"></A>was the stretching out of their sceptre. In ancient times their power extended 
<A NAME="863"></A>continuously to all things whatsoever, in city and country, as well as 
<A NAME="864"></A>in foreign parts; but at a later date they relinquished several of these 
<A NAME="865"></A>privileges, and others the people took from them, until in some states 
<A NAME="866"></A>nothing was left to them but the sacrifices; and where they retained more 
<A NAME="867"></A>of the reality they had only the right of leadership in war beyond the 
<A NAME="868"></A>border.
<A NAME="869"></A><BR><BR>These, then, are the four kinds of royalty. First the monarchy 
<A NAME="870"></A>of the heroic ages; this was exercised over voluntary subjects, but limited 
<A NAME="871"></A>to certain functions; the king was a general and a judge, and had the control 
<A NAME="872"></A>of religion The second is that of the barbarians, which is a hereditary 
<A NAME="873"></A>despotic government in accordance with law. A third is the power of the 
<A NAME="874"></A>so-called Aesynmete or Dictator; this is an elective tyranny. The fourth 
<A NAME="875"></A>is the Lacedaemonian, which is in fact a generalship, hereditary and perpetual. 
<A NAME="876"></A>These four forms differ from one another in the manner which I have 
<A NAME="877"></A>described.
<A NAME="878"></A><BR><BR>(5) There is a fifth form of kingly rule in which one has the disposal 
<A NAME="879"></A>of all, just as each nation or each state has the disposal of public matters; 
<A NAME="880"></A>this form corresponds to the control of a household. For as household management 
<A NAME="881"></A>is the kingly rule of a house, so kingly rule is the household management 
<A NAME="882"></A>of a city, or of a nation, or of many nations.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="883"></A><B>Part XV</B>

<A NAME="884"></A><BR><BR>Of these forms we need only consider two, the Lacedaemonian and 
<A NAME="885"></A>the absolute royalty; for most of the others he in a region between them, 
<A NAME="886"></A>having less power than the last, and more than the first. Thus the inquiry 
<A NAME="887"></A>is reduced to two points: first, is it advantageous to the state that there 
<A NAME="888"></A>should be a perpetual general, and if so, should the office be confined 
<A NAME="889"></A>to one family, or open to the citizens in turn? Secondly, is it well that 
<A NAME="890"></A>a single man should have the supreme power in all things? The first question 
<A NAME="891"></A>falls under the head of laws rather than of constitutions; for perpetual 
<A NAME="892"></A>generalship might equally exist under any form of government, so that this 
<A NAME="893"></A>matter may be dismissed for the present. The other kind of royalty is a 
<A NAME="894"></A>sort of constitution; this we have now to consider, and briefly to run 
<A NAME="895"></A>over the difficulties involved in it. We will begin by inquiring whether 
<A NAME="896"></A>it is more advantageous to be ruled by the best man or by the best 
<A NAME="897"></A>laws.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR><BR>The advocates of royalty maintain that the laws speak only in general 
<A NAME="899"></A>terms, and cannot provide for circumstances; and that for any science to 
<A NAME="900"></A>abide by written rules is absurd. In Egypt the physician is allowed to 
<A NAME="901"></A>alter his treatment after the fourth day, but if sooner, he takes the risk. 
<A NAME="902"></A>Hence it is clear that a government acting according to written laws is 
<A NAME="903"></A>plainly not the best. Yet surely the ruler cannot dispense with the general 
<A NAME="904"></A>principle which exists in law; and this is a better ruler which is free 
<A NAME="905"></A>from passion than that in which it is innate. Whereas the law is passionless, 
<A NAME="906"></A>passion must ever sway the heart of man. Yes, it may be replied, but then 
<A NAME="907"></A>on the other hand an individual will be better able to deliberate in particular 
<A NAME="908"></A>cases.
<A NAME="909"></A><BR><BR>The best man, then, must legislate, and laws must be passed, but 
<A NAME="910"></A>these laws will have no authority when they miss the mark, though in all 
<A NAME="911"></A>other cases retaining their authority. But when the law cannot determine 
<A NAME="912"></A>a point at all, or not well, should the one best man or should all decide? 
<A NAME="913"></A>According to our present practice assemblies meet, sit in judgment, deliberate, 
<A NAME="914"></A>and decide, and their judgments an relate to individual cases. Now any 
<A NAME="915"></A>member of the assembly, taken separately, is certainly inferior to the 
<A NAME="916"></A>wise man. But the state is made up of many individuals. And as a feast 
<A NAME="917"></A>to which all the guests contribute is better than a banquet furnished by 
<A NAME="918"></A>a single man, so a multitude is a better judge of many things than any 
<A NAME="919"></A>individual.
<A NAME="920"></A><BR><BR>Again, the many are more incorruptible than the few; they are like 
<A NAME="921"></A>the greater quantity of water which is less easily corrupted than a little. 
<A NAME="922"></A>The individual is liable to be overcome by anger or by some other passion, 
<A NAME="923"></A>and then his judgment is necessarily perverted; but it is hardly to be 
<A NAME="924"></A>supposed that a great number of persons would all get into a passion and 
<A NAME="925"></A>go wrong at the same moment. Let us assume that they are the freemen, and 
<A NAME="926"></A>that they never act in violation of the law, but fill up the gaps which 
<A NAME="927"></A>the law is obliged to leave. Or, if such virtue is scarcely attainable 
<A NAME="928"></A>by the multitude, we need only suppose that the majority are good men and 
<A NAME="929"></A>good citizens, and ask which will be the more incorruptible, the one good 
<A NAME="930"></A>ruler, or the many who are all good? Will not the many? But, you will say, 
<A NAME="931"></A>there may be parties among them, whereas the one man is not divided against 
<A NAME="932"></A>himself. To which we may answer that their character is as good as his. 
<A NAME="933"></A>If we call the rule of many men, who are all of them good, aristocracy, 
<A NAME="934"></A>and the rule of one man royalty, then aristocracy will be better for states 
<A NAME="935"></A>than royalty, whether the government is supported by force or not, provided 
<A NAME="936"></A>only that a number of men equal in virtue can be found.
<A NAME="937"></A><BR><BR>The first governments were kingships, probably for this reason, 
<A NAME="938"></A>because of old, when cities were small, men of eminent virtue were few. 
<A NAME="939"></A>Further, they were made kings because they were benefactors, and benefits 
<A NAME="940"></A>can only be bestowed by good men. But when many persons equal in merit 
<A NAME="941"></A>arose, no longer enduring the pre-eminence of one, they desired to have 
<A NAME="942"></A>a commonwealth, and set up a constitution. The ruling class soon deteriorated 
<A NAME="943"></A>and enriched themselves out of the public treasury; riches became the path 
<A NAME="944"></A>to honor, and so oligarchies naturally grew up. These passed into tyrannies 
<A NAME="945"></A>and tyrannies into democracies; for love of gain in the ruling classes 
<A NAME="946"></A>was always tending to diminish their number, and so to strengthen the masses, 
<A NAME="947"></A>who in the end set upon their masters and established democracies. Since 
<A NAME="948"></A>cities have increased in size, no other form of government appears to be 
<A NAME="949"></A>any longer even easy to establish.
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><BR>Even supposing the principle to be maintained that kingly power 
<A NAME="951"></A>is the best thing for states, how about the family of the king? Are his 
<A NAME="952"></A>children to succeed him? If they are no better than anybody else, that 
<A NAME="953"></A>will be mischievous. But, says the lover of royalty, the king, though he 
<A NAME="954"></A>might, will not hand on his power to his children. That, however, is hardly 
<A NAME="955"></A>to be expected, and is too much to ask of human nature. There is also a 
<A NAME="956"></A>difficulty about the force which he is to employ; should a king have guards 
<A NAME="957"></A>about him by whose aid he may be able to coerce the refractory? If not, 
<A NAME="958"></A>how will he administer his kingdom? Even if he be the lawful sovereign 
<A NAME="959"></A>who does nothing arbitrarily or contrary to law, still he must have some 
<A NAME="960"></A>force wherewith to maintain the law. In the case of a limited monarchy 
<A NAME="961"></A>there is not much difficulty in answering this question; the king must 
<A NAME="962"></A>have such force as will be more than a match for one or more individuals, 
<A NAME="963"></A>but not so great as that of the people. The ancients observe this principle 
<A NAME="964"></A>when they have guards to any one whom they appointed dictator or tyrant. 
<A NAME="965"></A>Thus, when Dionysius asked the Syracusans to allow him guards, somebody 
<A NAME="966"></A>advised that they should give him only such a number.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="967"></A><B>Part XVI</B>

<A NAME="968"></A><BR><BR>At this place in the discussion there impends the inquiry respecting 
<A NAME="969"></A>the king who acts solely according to his own will he has now to be considered. 
<A NAME="970"></A>The so-called limited monarchy, or kingship according to law, as I have 
<A NAME="971"></A>already remarked, is not a distinct form of government, for under all governments, 
<A NAME="972"></A>as, for example, in a democracy or aristocracy, there may be a general 
<A NAME="973"></A>holding office for life, and one person is often made supreme over the 
<A NAME="974"></A>administration of a state. A magistracy of this kind exists at Epidamnus, 
<A NAME="975"></A>and also at Opus, but in the latter city has a more limited power. Now, 
<A NAME="976"></A>absolute monarchy, or the arbitrary rule of a sovereign over an the citizens, 
<A NAME="977"></A>in a city which consists of equals, is thought by some to be quite contrary 
<A NAME="978"></A>to nature; it is argued that those who are by nature equals must have the 
<A NAME="979"></A>same natural right and worth, and that for unequals to have an equal share, 
<A NAME="980"></A>or for equals to have an uneven share, in the offices of state, is as bad 
<A NAME="981"></A>as for different bodily constitutions to have the same food and clothing. 
<A NAME="982"></A>Wherefore it is thought to be just that among equals every one be ruled 
<A NAME="983"></A>as well as rule, and therefore that an should have their turn. We thus 
<A NAME="984"></A>arrive at law; for an order of succession implies law. And the rule of 
<A NAME="985"></A>the law, it is argued, is preferable to that of any individual. On the 
<A NAME="986"></A>same principle, even if it be better for certain individuals to govern, 
<A NAME="987"></A>they should be made only guardians and ministers of the law. For magistrates 
<A NAME="988"></A>there must be- this is admitted; but then men say that to give authority 
<A NAME="989"></A>to any one man when all are equal is unjust. Nay, there may indeed be cases 
<A NAME="990"></A>which the law seems unable to determine, but in such cases can a man? Nay, 
<A NAME="991"></A>it will be replied, the law trains officers for this express purpose, and 
<A NAME="992"></A>appoints them to determine matters which are left undecided by it, to the 
<A NAME="993"></A>best of their judgment. Further, it permits them to make any amendment 
<A NAME="994"></A>of the existing laws which experience suggests. Therefore he who bids the 
<A NAME="995"></A>law rule may be deemed to bid God and Reason alone rule, but he who bids 
<A NAME="996"></A>man rule adds an element of the beast; for desire is a wild beast, and 
<A NAME="997"></A>passion perverts the minds of rulers, even when they are the best of men. 
<A NAME="998"></A>The law is reason unaffected by desire. We are told that a patient should 
<A NAME="999"></A>call in a physician; he will not get better if he is doctored out of a 
<A NAME="1000"></A>book. But the parallel of the arts is clearly not in point; for the physician 
<A NAME="1001"></A>does nothing contrary to rule from motives of friendship; he only cures 
<A NAME="1002"></A>a patient and takes a fee; whereas magistrates do many things from spite 
<A NAME="1003"></A>and partiality. And, indeed, if a man suspected the physician of being 
<A NAME="1004"></A>in league with his enemies to destroy him for a bribe, he would rather 
<A NAME="1005"></A>have recourse to the book. But certainly physicians, when they are sick, 
<A NAME="1006"></A>call in other physicians, and training-masters, when they are in training, 
<A NAME="1007"></A>other training-masters, as if they could not judge judge truly about their 
<A NAME="1008"></A>own case and might be influenced by their feelings. Hence it is evident 
<A NAME="1009"></A>that in seeking for justice men seek for the mean or neutral, for the law 
<A NAME="1010"></A>is the mean. Again, customary laws have more weight, and relate to more 
<A NAME="1011"></A>important matters, than written laws, and a man may be a safer ruler than 
<A NAME="1012"></A>the written law, but not safer than the customary law.
<A NAME="1013"></A><BR><BR>Again, it is by no means easy for one man to superintend many things; 
<A NAME="1014"></A>he will have to appoint a number of subordinates, and what difference does 
<A NAME="1015"></A>it make whether these subordinates always existed or were appointed by 
<A NAME="1016"></A>him because he needed theme If, as I said before, the good man has a right 
<A NAME="1017"></A>to rule because he is better, still two good men are better than one: this 
<A NAME="1018"></A>is the old saying, two going together, and the prayer of Agamemnon, <BR><BR>"Would 
<A NAME="1019"></A>that I had ten such councillors! "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1020"></A>And at this day there are magistrates, for example judges, who have authority 
<A NAME="1021"></A>to decide some matters which the law is unable to determine, since no one 
<A NAME="1022"></A>doubts that the law would command and decide in the best manner whatever 
<A NAME="1023"></A>it could. But some things can, and other things cannot, be comprehended 
<A NAME="1024"></A>under the law, and this is the origin of the nexted question whether the 
<A NAME="1025"></A>best law or the best man should rule. For matters of detail about which 
<A NAME="1026"></A>men deliberate cannot be included in legislation. Nor does any one deny 
<A NAME="1027"></A>that the decision of such matters must be left to man, but it is argued 
<A NAME="1028"></A>that there should be many judges, and not one only. For every ruler who 
<A NAME="1029"></A>has been trained by the law judges well; and it would surely seem strange 
<A NAME="1030"></A>that a person should see better with two eyes, or hear better with two 
<A NAME="1031"></A>ears, or act better with two hands or feet, than many with many; indeed, 
<A NAME="1032"></A>it is already the practice of kings to make to themselves many eyes and 
<A NAME="1033"></A>ears and hands and feet. For they make colleagues of those who are the 
<A NAME="1034"></A>friends of themselves and their governments. They must be friends of the 
<A NAME="1035"></A>monarch and of his government; if not his friends, they will not do what 
<A NAME="1036"></A>he wants; but friendship implies likeness and equality; and, therefore, 
<A NAME="1037"></A>if he thinks that his friends ought to rule, he must think that those who 
<A NAME="1038"></A>are equal to himself and like himself ought to rule equally with himself. 
<A NAME="1039"></A>These are the principal controversies relating to monarchy.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1040"></A><B>Part XVII</B>

<A NAME="1041"></A><BR><BR>But may not all this be true in some cases and not in others? for 
<A NAME="1042"></A>there is by nature both a justice and an advantage appropriate to the rule 
<A NAME="1043"></A>of a master, another to kingly rule, another to constitutional rule; but 
<A NAME="1044"></A>there is none naturally appropriate to tyranny, or to any other perverted 
<A NAME="1045"></A>form of government; for these come into being contrary to nature. Now, 
<A NAME="1046"></A>to judge at least from what has been said, it is manifest that, where men 
<A NAME="1047"></A>are alike and equal, it is neither expedient nor just that one man should 
<A NAME="1048"></A>be lord of all, whether there are laws, or whether there are no laws, but 
<A NAME="1049"></A>he himself is in the place of law. Neither should a good man be lord over 
<A NAME="1050"></A>good men, nor a bad man over bad; nor, even if he excels in virtue, should 
<A NAME="1051"></A>he have a right to rule, unless in a particular case, at which I have already 
<A NAME="1052"></A>hinted, and to which I will once more recur. But first of all, I must determine 
<A NAME="1053"></A>what natures are suited for government by a king, and what for an aristocracy, 
<A NAME="1054"></A>and what for a constitutional government.
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR><BR>A people who are by nature capable of producing a race superior 
<A NAME="1056"></A>in the virtue needed for political rule are fitted for kingly government; 
<A NAME="1057"></A>and a people submitting to be ruled as freemen by men whose virtue renders 
<A NAME="1058"></A>them capable of political command are adapted for an aristocracy; while 
<A NAME="1059"></A>the people who are suited for constitutional freedom are those among whom 
<A NAME="1060"></A>there naturally exists a warlike multitude able to rule and to obey in 
<A NAME="1061"></A>turn by a law which gives office to the well-to-do according to their desert. 
<A NAME="1062"></A>But when a whole family or some individual, happens to be so pre-eminent 
<A NAME="1063"></A>in virtue as to surpass all others, then it is just that they should be 
<A NAME="1064"></A>the royal family and supreme over all, or that this one citizen should 
<A NAME="1065"></A>be king of the whole nation. For, as I said before, to give them authority 
<A NAME="1066"></A>is not only agreeable to that ground of right which the founders of all 
<A NAME="1067"></A>states, whether aristocratical, or oligarchical, or again democratical, 
<A NAME="1068"></A>are accustomed to put forward (for these all recognize the claim of excellence, 
<A NAME="1069"></A>although not the same excellence), but accords with the principle already 
<A NAME="1070"></A>laid down. For surely it would not be right to kill, or ostracize, or exile 
<A NAME="1071"></A>such a person, or require that he should take his turn in being governed. 
<A NAME="1072"></A>The whole is naturally superior to the part, and he who has this pre-eminence 
<A NAME="1073"></A>is in the relation of a whole to a part. But if so, the only alternative 
<A NAME="1074"></A>is that he should have the supreme power, and that mankind should obey 
<A NAME="1075"></A>him, not in turn, but always. These are the conclusions at which we arrive 
<A NAME="1076"></A>respecting royalty and its various forms, and this is the answer to the 
<A NAME="1077"></A>question, whether it is or is not advantageous to states, and to which, 
<A NAME="1078"></A>and how.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1079"></A><B>Part XVIII</B>

<A NAME="1080"></A><BR><BR>We maintain that the true forms of government are three, and that 
<A NAME="1081"></A>the best must be that which is administered by the best, and in which there 
<A NAME="1082"></A>is one man, or a whole family, or many persons, excelling all the others 
<A NAME="1083"></A>together in virtue, and both rulers and subjects are fitted, the one to 
<A NAME="1084"></A>rule, the others to be ruled, in such a manner as to attain the most eligible 
<A NAME="1085"></A>life. We showed at the commencement of our inquiry that the virtue of the 
<A NAME="1086"></A>good man is necessarily the same as the virtue of the citizen of the perfect
<A NAME="1087"></A>state. Clearly then in the same manner, and by the same means through which a
<A NAME="1088"></A>man becomes truly good, he will frame a state that is to be ruled by an 
<A NAME="1089"></A>aristocracy or by a king, and the same education and the same habits will be 
<A NAME="1090"></A>found to make a good man and a man fit to be a statesman or a king.
<A NAME="1091"></A><BR><BR>Having arrived at these conclusions, we must proceed to speak of the
<A NAME="1092"></A>perfect state, and describe how it comes into being and is established.
