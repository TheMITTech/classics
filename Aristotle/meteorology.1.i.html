<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>We have already discussed the first causes of nature, and all natural motion, 
<A NAME="12"></A>also the stars ordered in the motion of the heavens, and the physical element-enumerating 
<A NAME="13"></A>and specifying them and showing how they change into one another-and becoming 
<A NAME="14"></A>and perishing in general. There remains for consideration a part of this 
<A NAME="15"></A>inquiry which all our predecessors called meteorology. It is concerned 
<A NAME="16"></A>with events that are natural, though their order is less perfect than that 
<A NAME="17"></A>of the first of the elements of bodies. They take place in the region nearest 
<A NAME="18"></A>to the motion of the stars. Such are the milky way, and comets, and the 
<A NAME="19"></A>movements of meteors. It studies also all the affections we may call common 
<A NAME="20"></A>to air and water, and the kinds and parts of the earth and the affections 
<A NAME="21"></A>of its parts. These throw light on the causes of winds and earthquakes 
<A NAME="22"></A>and all the consequences the motions of these kinds and parts involve. 
<A NAME="23"></A>Of these things some puzzle us, while others admit of explanation in some 
<A NAME="24"></A>degree. Further, the inquiry is concerned with the falling of thunderbolts 
<A NAME="25"></A>and with whirlwinds and fire-winds, and further, the recurrent affections 
<A NAME="26"></A>produced in these same bodies by concretion. When the inquiry into these 
<A NAME="27"></A>matters is concluded let us consider what account we can give, in accordance 
<A NAME="28"></A>with the method we have followed, of animals and plants, both generally 
<A NAME="29"></A>and in detail. When that has been done we may say that the whole of our 
<A NAME="30"></A>original undertaking will have been carried out.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>After this introduction let us begin by discussing our immediate 
<A NAME="32"></A>subject.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="33"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>We have already laid down that there is one physical element which 
<A NAME="35"></A>makes up the system of the bodies that move in a circle, and besides this 
<A NAME="36"></A>four bodies owing their existence to the four principles, the motion of 
<A NAME="37"></A>these latter bodies being of two kinds: either from the centre or to the 
<A NAME="38"></A>centre. These four bodies are fire, air, water, earth. Fire occupies the 
<A NAME="39"></A>highest place among them all, earth the lowest, and two elements correspond 
<A NAME="40"></A>to these in their relation to one another, air being nearest to fire, water 
<A NAME="41"></A>to earth. The whole world surrounding the earth, then, the affections of 
<A NAME="42"></A>which are our subject, is made up of these bodies. This world necessarily 
<A NAME="43"></A>has a certain continuity with the upper motions: consequently all its power 
<A NAME="44"></A>and order is derived from them. (For the originating principle of all motion 
<A NAME="45"></A>is the first cause. Besides, that clement is eternal and its motion has 
<A NAME="46"></A>no limit in space, but is always complete; whereas all these other bodies 
<A NAME="47"></A>have separate regions which limit one another.) So we must treat fire and 
<A NAME="48"></A>earth and the elements like them as the material causes of the events in 
<A NAME="49"></A>this world (meaning by material what is subject and is affected), but must 
<A NAME="50"></A>assign causality in the sense of the originating principle of motion to 
<A NAME="51"></A>the influence of the eternally moving bodies.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="52"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>Let us first recall our original principles and the distinctions 
<A NAME="54"></A>already drawn and then explain the 'milky way' and comets and the other 
<A NAME="55"></A>phenomena akin to these.
<A NAME="56"></A><BR><BR>Fire, air, water, earth, we assert, originate from one another, 
<A NAME="57"></A>and each of them exists potentially in each, as all things do that can 
<A NAME="58"></A>be resolved into a common and ultimate substrate.
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>The first difficulty is raised by what is called the air. What 
<A NAME="60"></A>are we to take its nature to be in the world surrounding the earth? And 
<A NAME="61"></A>what is its position relatively to the other physical elements. (For there 
<A NAME="62"></A>is no question as to the relation of the bulk of the earth to the size 
<A NAME="63"></A>of the bodies which exist around it, since astronomical demonstrations 
<A NAME="64"></A>have by this time proved to us that it is actually far smaller than some 
<A NAME="65"></A>individual stars. As for the water, it is not observed to exist collectively 
<A NAME="66"></A>and separately, nor can it do so apart from that volume of it which has 
<A NAME="67"></A>its seat about the earth: the sea, that is, and rivers, which we can see, 
<A NAME="68"></A>and any subterranean water that may be hidden from our observation.) The 
<A NAME="69"></A>question is really about that which lies between the earth and the nearest 
<A NAME="70"></A>stars. Are we to consider it to be one kind of body or more than one? And 
<A NAME="71"></A>if more than one, how many are there and what are the bounds of their 
<A NAME="72"></A>regions?
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>We have already described and characterized the first element, 
<A NAME="74"></A>and explained that the whole world of the upper motions is full of that 
<A NAME="75"></A>body.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>This is an opinion we are not alone in holding: it appears to be 
<A NAME="77"></A>an old assumption and one which men have held in the past, for the word 
<A NAME="78"></A>ether has long been used to denote that element. Anaxagoras, it is true, 
<A NAME="79"></A>seems to me to think that the word means the same as fire. For he thought 
<A NAME="80"></A>that the upper regions were full of fire, and that men referred to those 
<A NAME="81"></A>regions when they spoke of ether. In the latter point he was right, for 
<A NAME="82"></A>men seem to have assumed that a body that was eternally in motion was also 
<A NAME="83"></A>divine in nature; and, as such a body was different from any of the terrestrial 
<A NAME="84"></A>elements, they determined to call it 'ether'.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>For the um opinions appear in cycles among men not once nor twice, 
<A NAME="86"></A>but infinitely often.
<A NAME="87"></A><BR><BR>Now there are some who maintain that not only the bodies in motion 
<A NAME="88"></A>but that which contains them is pure fire, and the interval between the 
<A NAME="89"></A>earth and the stars air: but if they had considered what is now satisfactorily 
<A NAME="90"></A>established by mathematics, they might have given up this puerile opinion. 
<A NAME="91"></A>For it is altogether childish to suppose that the moving bodies are all 
<A NAME="92"></A>of them of a small size, because they so to us, looking at them from the 
<A NAME="93"></A>earth.
<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>This a matter which we have already discussed in our treatment 
<A NAME="95"></A>of the upper region, but we may return to the point 
<A NAME="96"></A>now.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>If the intervals were full of fire and the bodies consisted of 
<A NAME="98"></A>fire every one of the other elements would long ago have 
<A NAME="99"></A>vanished.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>However, they cannot simply be said to be full of air either; for 
<A NAME="101"></A>even if there were two elements to fill the space between the earth and 
<A NAME="102"></A>the heavens, the air would far exceed the quantitu required to maintain 
<A NAME="103"></A>its proper proportion to the other elements. For the bulk of the earth 
<A NAME="104"></A>(which includes the whole volume of water) is infinitesimal in comparison 
<A NAME="105"></A>with the whole world that surrounds it. Now we find that the excess in 
<A NAME="106"></A>volume is not proportionately great where water dissolves into air or air 
<A NAME="107"></A>into fire. Whereas the proportion between any given small quantity of water 
<A NAME="108"></A>and the air that is generated from it ought to hold good between the total 
<A NAME="109"></A>amount of air and the total amount of water. Nor does it make any difference 
<A NAME="110"></A>if any one denies that the elements originate from one another, but asserts 
<A NAME="111"></A>that they are equal in power. For on this view it is certain amounts of 
<A NAME="112"></A>each that are equal in power, just as would be the case if they actually 
<A NAME="113"></A>originated from one another.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>So it is clear that neither air nor fire alone fills the intermediate 
<A NAME="115"></A>space.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>It remains to explain, after a preliminary discussion of difficulties, 
<A NAME="117"></A>the relation of the two elements air and fire to the position of the first 
<A NAME="118"></A>element, and the reason why the stars in the upper region impart heat to 
<A NAME="119"></A>the earth and its neighbourhood. Let us first treat of the air, as we proposed, 
<A NAME="120"></A>and then go on to these questions.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Since water is generated from air, and air from water, why are 
<A NAME="122"></A>clouds not formed in the upper air? They ought to form there the more, 
<A NAME="123"></A>the further from the earth and the colder that region is. For it is neither 
<A NAME="124"></A>appreciably near to the heat of the stars, nor to the rays relected from 
<A NAME="125"></A>the earth. It is these that dissolve any formation by their heat and so 
<A NAME="126"></A>prevent clouds from forming near the earth. For clouds gather at the point 
<A NAME="127"></A>where the reflected rays disperse in the infinity of space and are lost. 
<A NAME="128"></A>To explain this we must suppose either that it is not all air which water 
<A NAME="129"></A>is generated, or, if it is produced from all air alike, that what immediately 
<A NAME="130"></A>surrounds the earth is not mere air, but a sort of vapour, and that its 
<A NAME="131"></A>vaporous nature is the reason why it condenses back to water again. But 
<A NAME="132"></A>if the whole of that vast region is vapour, the amount of air and of water 
<A NAME="133"></A>will be disproportionately great. For the spaces left by the heavenly bodies 
<A NAME="134"></A>must be filled by some element. This cannot be fire, for then all the rest 
<A NAME="135"></A>would have been dried up. Consequently, what fills it must be air and the 
<A NAME="136"></A>water that surrounds the whole earth-vapour being water 
<A NAME="137"></A>dissolved.
<A NAME="138"></A><BR><BR>After this exposition of the difficulties involved, let us go on 
<A NAME="139"></A>to lay down the truth, with a view at once to what follows and to what 
<A NAME="140"></A>has already been said. The upper region as far as the moon we affirm to 
<A NAME="141"></A>consist of a body distinct both from fire and from air, but varying degree 
<A NAME="142"></A>of purity and in kind, especially towards its limit on the side of the 
<A NAME="143"></A>air, and of the world surrounding the earth. Now the circular motion of 
<A NAME="144"></A>the first element and of the bodies it contains dissolves, and inflames 
<A NAME="145"></A>by its motion, whatever part of the lower world is nearest to it, and so 
<A NAME="146"></A>generates heat. From another point of view we may look at the motion as 
<A NAME="147"></A>follows. The body that lies below the circular motion of the heavens is, 
<A NAME="148"></A>in a sort, matter, and is potentially hot, cold, dry, moist, and possessed 
<A NAME="149"></A>of whatever other qualities are derived from these. But it actually acquires 
<A NAME="150"></A>or retains one of these in virtue of motion or rest, the cause and principle 
<A NAME="151"></A>of which has already been explained. So at the centre and round it we get 
<A NAME="152"></A>earth and water, the heaviest and coldest elements, by themselves; round 
<A NAME="153"></A>them and contiguous with them, air and what we commonly call fire. It is 
<A NAME="154"></A>not really fire, for fire is an excess of heat and a sort of ebullition; 
<A NAME="155"></A>but in reality, of what we call air, the part surrounding the earth is 
<A NAME="156"></A>moist and warm, because it contains both vapour and a dry exhalation from 
<A NAME="157"></A>the earth. But the next part, above that, is warm and dry. For vapour is 
<A NAME="158"></A>naturally moist and cold, but the exhalation warm and dry; and vapour is 
<A NAME="159"></A>potentially like water, the exhalation potentially like fire. So we must 
<A NAME="160"></A>take the reason why clouds are not formed in the upper region to be this: 
<A NAME="161"></A>that it is filled not with mere air but rather with a sort of 
<A NAME="162"></A>fire.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>However, it may well be that the formation of clouds in that upper 
<A NAME="164"></A>region is also prevented by the circular motion. For the air round the 
<A NAME="165"></A>earth is necessarily all of it in motion, except that which is cut off 
<A NAME="166"></A>inside the circumference which makes the earth a complete sphere. In the 
<A NAME="167"></A>case of winds it is actually observable that they originate in marshy districts 
<A NAME="168"></A>of the earth; and they do not seem to blow above the level of the highest 
<A NAME="169"></A>mountains. It is the revolution of the heaven which carries the air with 
<A NAME="170"></A>it and causes its circular motion, fire being continuous with the upper 
<A NAME="171"></A>element and air with fire. Thus its motion is a second reason why that 
<A NAME="172"></A>air is not condensed into water.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>But whenever a particle of air grows heavy, the warmth in it is 
<A NAME="174"></A>squeezed out into the upper region and it sinks, and other particles in 
<A NAME="175"></A>turn are carried up together with the fiery exhalation. Thus the one region 
<A NAME="176"></A>is always full of air and the other of fire, and each of them is perpetually 
<A NAME="177"></A>in a state of change.
<A NAME="178"></A><BR><BR>So much to explain why clouds are not formed and why the air is 
<A NAME="179"></A>not condensed into water, and what account must be given of the space between 
<A NAME="180"></A>the stars and the earth, and what is the body that fills 
<A NAME="181"></A>it.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>As for the heat derived from the sun, the right place for a special 
<A NAME="183"></A>and scientific account of it is in the treatise about sense, since heat 
<A NAME="184"></A>is an affection of sense, but we may now explain how it can be produced 
<A NAME="185"></A>by the heavenly bodies which are not themselves hot.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>We see that motion is able to dissolve and inflame the air; indeed, 
<A NAME="187"></A>moving bodies are often actually found to melt. Now the sun's motion alone 
<A NAME="188"></A>is sufficient to account for the origin of terrestrial warmth and heat. 
<A NAME="189"></A>For a motion that is to have this effect must be rapid and near, and that 
<A NAME="190"></A>of the stars is rapid but distant, while that of the moon is near but slow, 
<A NAME="191"></A>whereas the sun's motion combines both conditions in a sufficient degree. 
<A NAME="192"></A>That most heat should be generated where the sun is present is easy to 
<A NAME="193"></A>understand if we consider the analogy of terrestrial phenomena, for here, 
<A NAME="194"></A>too, it is the air that is nearest to a thing in rapid motion which is 
<A NAME="195"></A>heated most. This is just what we should expect, as it is the nearest air 
<A NAME="196"></A>that is most dissolved by the motion of a solid body.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>This then is one reason why heat reaches our world. Another is 
<A NAME="198"></A>that the fire surrounding the air is often scattered by the motion of the 
<A NAME="199"></A>heavens and driven downwards in spite of itself.
<A NAME="200"></A><BR><BR>Shooting-stars further suffix to prove that the celestial sphere 
<A NAME="201"></A>is not hot or fiery: for they do not occur in that upper region but below: 
<A NAME="202"></A>yet the more and the faster a thing moves, the more apt it is to take fire. 
<A NAME="203"></A>Besides, the sun, which most of all the stars is considered to be hot, 
<A NAME="204"></A>is really white and not fiery in colour.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="205"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="206"></A><BR><BR>Having determined these principles let us explain the cause of 
<A NAME="207"></A>the appearance in the sky of burning flames and of shooting-stars, and 
<A NAME="208"></A>of 'torches', and 'goats', as some people call them. All these phenomena 
<A NAME="209"></A>are one and the same thing, and are due to the same cause, the difference 
<A NAME="210"></A>between them being one of degree.
<A NAME="211"></A><BR><BR>The explanation of these and many other phenomena is this. When 
<A NAME="212"></A>the sun warms the earth the evaporation which takes place is necessarily 
<A NAME="213"></A>of two kinds, not of one only as some think. One kind is rather of the 
<A NAME="214"></A>nature of vapour, the other of the nature of a windy exhalation. That which 
<A NAME="215"></A>rises from the moisture contained in the earth and on its surface is vapour, 
<A NAME="216"></A>while that rising from the earth itself, which is dry, is like smoke. Of 
<A NAME="217"></A>these the windy exhalation, being warm, rises above the moister vapour, 
<A NAME="218"></A>which is heavy and sinks below the other. Hence the world surrounding the 
<A NAME="219"></A>earth is ordered as follows. First below the circular motion comes the 
<A NAME="220"></A>warm and dry element, which we call fire, for there is no word fully adequate 
<A NAME="221"></A>to every state of the fumid evaporation: but we must use this terminology 
<A NAME="222"></A>since this element is the most inflammable of all bodies. Below this comes 
<A NAME="223"></A>air. We must think of what we just called fire as being spread round the 
<A NAME="224"></A>terrestrial sphere on the outside like a kind of fuel, so that a little 
<A NAME="225"></A>motion often makes it burst into flame just as smoke does: for flame is 
<A NAME="226"></A>the ebullition of a dry exhalation. So whenever the circular motion stirs 
<A NAME="227"></A>this stuff up in any way, it catches fire at the point at which it is most 
<A NAME="228"></A>inflammable. The result differs according to the disposition and quantity 
<A NAME="229"></A>of the combustible material. If this is broad and long, we often see a 
<A NAME="230"></A>flame burning as in a field of stubble: if it burns lengthwise only, we 
<A NAME="231"></A>see what are called 'torches' and 'goats' and shooting-stars. Now when 
<A NAME="232"></A>the inflammable material is longer than it is broad sometimes it seems 
<A NAME="233"></A>to throw off sparks as it burns. (This happens because matter catches fire 
<A NAME="234"></A>at the sides in small portions but continuously with the main body.) Then 
<A NAME="235"></A>it is called a 'goat'. When this does not happen it is a 'torch'. But if 
<A NAME="236"></A>the whole length of the exhalation is scattered in small parts and in many 
<A NAME="237"></A>directions and in breadth and depth alike, we get what are called 
<A NAME="238"></A>shooting-stars.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>The cause of these shooting-stars is sometimes the motion which 
<A NAME="240"></A>ignites the exhalation. At other times the air is condensed by cold and 
<A NAME="241"></A>squeezes out and ejects the hot element; making their motion look more 
<A NAME="242"></A>like that of a thing thrown than like a running fire. For the question 
<A NAME="243"></A>might be raised whether the 'shooting' of a 'star' is the same thing as 
<A NAME="244"></A>when you put an exhalation below a lamp and it lights the lower lamp from 
<A NAME="245"></A>the flame above. For here too the flame passes wonderfully quickly and 
<A NAME="246"></A>looks like a thing thrown, and not as if one thing after another caught 
<A NAME="247"></A>fire. Or is a 'star' when it 'shoots' a single body that is thrown? Apparently 
<A NAME="248"></A>both cases occur: sometimes it is like the flame from the lamp and sometimes 
<A NAME="249"></A>bodies are projected by being squeezed out (like fruit stones from one's 
<A NAME="250"></A>fingers) and so are seen to fall into the sea and on the dry land, both 
<A NAME="251"></A>by night and by day when the sky is clear. They are thrown downwards because 
<A NAME="252"></A>the condensation which propels them inclines downwards. Thunderbolts fall 
<A NAME="253"></A>downwards for the same reason: their origin is never combustion but ejection 
<A NAME="254"></A>under pressure, since naturally all heat tends upwards.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>When the phenomenon is formed in the upper region it is due to 
<A NAME="256"></A>the combustion of the exhalation. When it takes place at a lower level 
<A NAME="257"></A>it is due to the ejection of the exhalation by the condensing and cooling 
<A NAME="258"></A>of the moister evaporation: for this latter as it condenses and inclines 
<A NAME="259"></A>downward contracts, and thrusts out the hot element and causes it to be 
<A NAME="260"></A>thrown downwards. The motion is upwards or downwards or sideways according 
<A NAME="261"></A>to the way in which the evaporation lies, and its disposition in respect 
<A NAME="262"></A>of breadth and depth. In most cases the direction is sideways because two 
<A NAME="263"></A>motions are involved, a compulsory motion downwards and a natural motion 
<A NAME="264"></A>upwards, and under these circumstances an object always moves obliquely. 
<A NAME="265"></A>Hence the motion of 'shooting-stars' is generally oblique.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>So the material cause of all these phenomena is the exhalation, 
<A NAME="267"></A>the efficient cause sometimes the upper motion, sometimes the contraction 
<A NAME="268"></A>and condensation of the air. Further, all these things happen below the 
<A NAME="269"></A>moon. This is shown by their apparent speed, which is equal to that of 
<A NAME="270"></A>things thrown by us; for it is because they are close to us, that these 
<A NAME="271"></A>latter seem far to exceed in speed the stars, the sun, and the 
<A NAME="272"></A>moon.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="273"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="274"></A><BR><BR>Sometimes on a fine night we see a variety of appearances that 
<A NAME="275"></A>form in the sky: 'chasms' for instance and 'trenches' and blood-red colours. 
<A NAME="276"></A>These, too, have the same cause. For we have seen that the upper air condenses 
<A NAME="277"></A>into an inflammable condition and that the combustion sometimes takes on 
<A NAME="278"></A>the appearance of a burning flame, sometimes that of moving torches and 
<A NAME="279"></A>stars. So it is not surprising that this same air when condensing should 
<A NAME="280"></A>assume a variety of colours. For a weak light shining through a dense air, 
<A NAME="281"></A>and the air when it acts as a mirror, will cause all kinds of colours to 
<A NAME="282"></A>appear, but especially crimson and purple. For these colours generally 
<A NAME="283"></A>appear when fire-colour and white are combined by superposition. Thus on 
<A NAME="284"></A>a hot day, or through a smoky, medium, the stars when they rise and set 
<A NAME="285"></A>look crimson. The light will also create colours by reflection when the 
<A NAME="286"></A>mirror is such as to reflect colour only and not shape.
<A NAME="287"></A><BR><BR>These appearances do not persist long, because the condensation 
<A NAME="288"></A>of the air is transient.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>'Chasms' get their appearance of depth from light breaking out 
<A NAME="290"></A>of a dark blue or black mass of air. When the process of condensation goes 
<A NAME="291"></A>further in such a case we often find 'torches' ejected. When the 'chasm' 
<A NAME="292"></A>contracts it presents the appearance of a 'trench'.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>In general, white in contrast with black creates a variety of colours; 
<A NAME="294"></A>like flame, for instance, through a medium of smoke. But by day the sun 
<A NAME="295"></A>obscures them, and, with the exception of crimson, the colours are not 
<A NAME="296"></A>seen at night because they are dark.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>These then must be taken to be the causes of 'shooting-stars' and 
<A NAME="298"></A>the phenomena of combustion and also of the other transient appearances 
<A NAME="299"></A>of this kind.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="300"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>Let us go on to explain the nature of comets and the 'milky way', 
<A NAME="302"></A>after a preliminary discussion of the views of others.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>Anaxagoras and Democritus declare that comets are a conjunction 
<A NAME="304"></A>of the planets approaching one another and so appearing to touch one 
<A NAME="305"></A>another.
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>Some of the Italians called Pythagoreans say that the comet is 
<A NAME="307"></A>one of the planets, but that it appears at great intervals of time and 
<A NAME="308"></A>only rises a little above the horizon. This is the case with Mercury too; 
<A NAME="309"></A>because it only rises a little above the horizon it often fails to be seen 
<A NAME="310"></A>and consequently appears at great intervals of time.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>A view like theirs was also expressed by Hippocrates of Chios and 
<A NAME="312"></A>his pupil Aeschylus. Only they say that the tail does not belong to the 
<A NAME="313"></A>comet iself, but is occasionally assumed by it on its course in certain 
<A NAME="314"></A>situations, when our sight is reflected to the sun from the moisture attracted 
<A NAME="315"></A>by the comet. It appears at greater intervals than the other stars because 
<A NAME="316"></A>it is slowest to get clear of the sun and has been left behind by the sun 
<A NAME="317"></A>to the extent of the whole of its circle before it reappears at the same 
<A NAME="318"></A>point. It gets clear of the sun both towards the north and towards the 
<A NAME="319"></A>south. In the space between the tropics it does not draw water to itself 
<A NAME="320"></A>because that region is dried up by the sun on its course. When it moves 
<A NAME="321"></A>towards the south it has no lack of the necessary moisture, but because 
<A NAME="322"></A>the segment of its circle which is above the horizon is small, and that 
<A NAME="323"></A>below it many times as large, it is impossible for the sun to be reflected 
<A NAME="324"></A>to our sight, either when it approaches the southern tropic, or at the 
<A NAME="325"></A>summer solstice. Hence in these regions it does not develop a tail at all. 
<A NAME="326"></A>But when it is visible in the north it assumes a tail because the arc above 
<A NAME="327"></A>the horizon is large and that below it small. For under these circumstances 
<A NAME="328"></A>there is nothing to prevent our vision from being reflected to the 
<A NAME="329"></A>sun.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>These views involve impossibilities, some of which are common to 
<A NAME="331"></A>all of them, while others are peculiar to some only.
<A NAME="332"></A><BR><BR>This is the case, first, with those who say that the comet is one 
<A NAME="333"></A>of the planets. For all the planets appear in the circle of the zodiac, 
<A NAME="334"></A>whereas many comets have been seen outside that circle. Again more comets 
<A NAME="335"></A>than one have often appeared simultaneously. Besides, if their tail is 
<A NAME="336"></A>due to reflection, as Aeschylus and Hippocrates say, this planet ought 
<A NAME="337"></A>sometimes to be visible without a tail since, as they it does not possess 
<A NAME="338"></A>a tail in every place in which it appears. But, as a matter of fact, no 
<A NAME="339"></A>planet has been observed besides the five. And all of them are often visible 
<A NAME="340"></A>above the horizon together at the same time. Further, comets are often 
<A NAME="341"></A>found to appear, as well when all the planets are visible as when some 
<A NAME="342"></A>are not, but are obscured by the neighbourhood of the sun. Moreover the 
<A NAME="343"></A>statement that a comet only appears in the north, with the sun at the summer 
<A NAME="344"></A>solstice, is not true either. The great comet which appeared at the time 
<A NAME="345"></A>of the earthquake in Achaea and the tidal wave rose due west; and many 
<A NAME="346"></A>have been known to appear in the south. Again in the archonship of Euclees, 
<A NAME="347"></A>son of Molon, at Athens there appeared a comet in the north in the month 
<A NAME="348"></A>Gamelion, the sun being about the winter solstice. Yet they themselves 
<A NAME="349"></A>admit that reflection over so great a space is an impossibility.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>An objection that tells equally against those who hold this theory 
<A NAME="351"></A>and those who say that comets are a coalescence of the planets is, first, 
<A NAME="352"></A>the fact that some of the fixed stars too get a tail. For this we must 
<A NAME="353"></A>not only accept the authority of the Egyptians who assert it, but we have 
<A NAME="354"></A>ourselves observed the fact. For a star in the thigh of the Dog had a tail, 
<A NAME="355"></A>though a faint one. If you fixed your sight on it its light was dim, but 
<A NAME="356"></A>if you just glanced at it, it appeared brighter. Besides, all the comets 
<A NAME="357"></A>that have been seen in our day have vanished without setting, gradually 
<A NAME="358"></A>fading away above the horizon; and they have not left behind them either 
<A NAME="359"></A>one or more stars. For instance the great comet we mentioned before appeared 
<A NAME="360"></A>to the west in winter in frosty weather when the sky was clear, in the 
<A NAME="361"></A>archonship of Asteius. On the first day it set before the sun and was then 
<A NAME="362"></A>not seen. On the next day it was seen, being ever so little behind the 
<A NAME="363"></A>sun and immediately setting. But its light extended over a third part of 
<A NAME="364"></A>the sky like a leap, so that people called it a 'path'. This comet receded 
<A NAME="365"></A>as far as Orion's belt and there dissolved. Democritus however, insists 
<A NAME="366"></A>upon the truth of his view and affirms that certain stars have been seen 
<A NAME="367"></A>when comets dissolve. But on his theory this ought not to occur occasionally 
<A NAME="368"></A>but always. Besides, the Egyptians affirm that conjunctions of the planets 
<A NAME="369"></A>with one another, and with the fixed stars, take place, and we have ourselves 
<A NAME="370"></A>observed Jupiter coinciding with one of the stars in the Twins and hiding 
<A NAME="371"></A>it, and yet no comet was formed. Further, we can also give a rational proof 
<A NAME="372"></A>of our point. It is true that some stars seem to be bigger than others, 
<A NAME="373"></A>yet each one by itself looks indivisible. Consequently, just as, if they 
<A NAME="374"></A>really had been indivisible, their conjunction could not have created any 
<A NAME="375"></A>greater magnitude, so now that they are not in fact indivisible but look 
<A NAME="376"></A>as if they were, their conjunction will not make them look any 
<A NAME="377"></A>bigger.
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>Enough has been said, without further argument, to show that the 
<A NAME="379"></A>causes brought forward to explain comets are false.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="380"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>We consider a satisfactory explanation of phenomena inaccessible 
<A NAME="382"></A>to observation to have been given when our account of them is free from 
<A NAME="383"></A>impossibilities. The observations before us suggest the following account 
<A NAME="384"></A>of the phenomena we are now considering. We know that the dry and warm 
<A NAME="385"></A>exhalation is the outermost part of the terrestrial world which falls below 
<A NAME="386"></A>the circular motion. It, and a great part of the air that is continuous 
<A NAME="387"></A>with it below, is carried round the earth by the motion of the circular 
<A NAME="388"></A>revolution. In the course of this motion it often ignites wherever it may 
<A NAME="389"></A>happen to be of the right consistency, and this we maintain to be the cause 
<A NAME="390"></A>of the 'shooting' of scattered 'stars'. We may say, then, that a comet 
<A NAME="391"></A>is formed when the upper motion introduces into a gathering of this kind 
<A NAME="392"></A>a fiery principle not of such excessive strength as to burn up much of 
<A NAME="393"></A>the material quickly, nor so weak as soon to be extinguished, but stronger 
<A NAME="394"></A>and capable of burning up much material, and when exhalation of the right 
<A NAME="395"></A>consistency rises from below and meets it. The kind of comet varies according 
<A NAME="396"></A>to the shape which the exhalation happens to take. If it is diffused equally 
<A NAME="397"></A>on every side the star is said to be fringed, if it stretches out in one 
<A NAME="398"></A>direction it is called bearded. We have seen that when a fiery principle 
<A NAME="399"></A>of this kind moves we seem to have a shooting-star: similarly when it stands 
<A NAME="400"></A>still we seem to have a star standing still. We may compare these phenomena 
<A NAME="401"></A>to a heap or mass of chaff into which a torch is thrust, or a spark thrown. 
<A NAME="402"></A>That is what a shooting-star is like. The fuel is so inflammable that the 
<A NAME="403"></A>fire runs through it quickly in a line. Now if this fire were to persist 
<A NAME="404"></A>instead of running through the fuel and perishing away, its course through 
<A NAME="405"></A>the fuel would stop at the point where the latter was densest, and then 
<A NAME="406"></A>the whole might begin to move. Such is a comet-like a shooting-star that 
<A NAME="407"></A>contains its beginning and end in itself.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>When the matter begins to gather in the lower region independently 
<A NAME="409"></A>the comet appears by itself. But when the exhalation is constituted by 
<A NAME="410"></A>one of the fixed stars or the planets, owing to their motion, one of them 
<A NAME="411"></A>becomes a comet. The fringe is not close to the stars themselves. Just 
<A NAME="412"></A>as haloes appear to follow the sun and the moon as they move, and encircle 
<A NAME="413"></A>them, when the air is dense enough for them to form along under the sun's 
<A NAME="414"></A>course, so too the fringe. It stands in the relation of a halo to the stars, 
<A NAME="415"></A>except that the colour of the halo is due to reflection, whereas in the 
<A NAME="416"></A>case of comets the colour is something that appears actually on 
<A NAME="417"></A>them.
<A NAME="418"></A><BR><BR>Now when this matter gathers in relation to a star the comet necessarily 
<A NAME="419"></A>appears to follow the same course as the star. But when the comet is formed 
<A NAME="420"></A>independently it falls behind the motion of the universe, like the rest 
<A NAME="421"></A>of the terrestrial world. It is this fact, that a comet often forms independently, 
<A NAME="422"></A>indeed oftener than round one of the regular stars, that makes it impossible 
<A NAME="423"></A>to maintain that a comet is a sort of reflection, not indeed, as Hippocrates 
<A NAME="424"></A>and his school say, to the sun, but to the very star it is alleged to accompany-in 
<A NAME="425"></A>fact, a kind of halo in the pure fuel of fire.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>As for the halo we shall explain its cause later.
<A NAME="427"></A><BR>The fact that comets when frequent foreshadow wind and drought must 
<A NAME="428"></A>be taken as an indication of their fiery constitution. For their origin 
<A NAME="429"></A>is plainly due to the plentiful supply of that secretion. Hence the air 
<A NAME="430"></A>is necessarily drier and the moist evaporation is so dissolved and dissipated 
<A NAME="431"></A>by the quantity of the hot exhalation as not readily to condense into water.-But 
<A NAME="432"></A>this phenomenon too shall be explained more clearly later when the time 
<A NAME="433"></A>comes to speak of the winds.-So when there are many comets and they are 
<A NAME="434"></A>dense, it is as we say, and the years are clearly dry and windy. When they 
<A NAME="435"></A>are fewer and fainter this effect does not appear in the same degree, though 
<A NAME="436"></A>as a rule the is found to be excessive either in duration or strength. 
<A NAME="437"></A>For instance when the stone at Aegospotami fell out of the air-it had been 
<A NAME="438"></A>carried up by a wind and fell down in the daytime-then too a comet happened 
<A NAME="439"></A>to have appeared in the west. And at the time of the great comet the winter 
<A NAME="440"></A>was dry and north winds prevailed, and the wave was due to an opposition 
<A NAME="441"></A>of winds. For in the gulf a north wind blew and outside it a violent south 
<A NAME="442"></A>wind. Again in the archonship of Nicomachus a comet appeared for a few 
<A NAME="443"></A>days about the equinoctial circle (this one had not risen in the west), 
<A NAME="444"></A>and simultaneously with it there happened the storm at 
<A NAME="445"></A>Corinth.
<A NAME="446"></A><BR><BR>That there are few comets and that they appear rarely and outside 
<A NAME="447"></A>the tropic circles more than within them is due to the motion of the sun 
<A NAME="448"></A>and the stars. For this motion does not only cause the hot principle to 
<A NAME="449"></A>be secreted but also dissolves it when it is gathering. But the chief reason 
<A NAME="450"></A>is that most of this stuff collects in the region of the milky 
<A NAME="451"></A>way.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="452"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="453"></A><BR><BR>Let us now explain the origin, cause, and nature of the milky way. 
<A NAME="454"></A>And here too let us begin by discussing the statements of others on the 
<A NAME="455"></A>subject.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>(1) Of the so-called Pythagoreans some say that this is the path 
<A NAME="457"></A>of one of the stars that fell from heaven at the time of Phaethon's downfall. 
<A NAME="458"></A>Others say that the sun used once to move in this circle and that this 
<A NAME="459"></A>region was scorched or met with some other affection of this kind, because 
<A NAME="460"></A>of the sun and its motion.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>But it is absurd not to see that if this were the reason the circle 
<A NAME="462"></A>of the Zodiac ought to be affected in the same way, and indeed more so 
<A NAME="463"></A>than that of the milky way, since not the sun only but all the planets 
<A NAME="464"></A>move in it. We can see the whole of this circle (half of it being visible 
<A NAME="465"></A>at any time of the night), but it shows no signs of any such affection 
<A NAME="466"></A>except where a part of it touches the circle of the milky 
<A NAME="467"></A>way.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR>(2) Anaxagoras, Democritus, and their schools say that the milky 
<A NAME="469"></A>way is the light of certain stars. For, they say, when the sun passes below 
<A NAME="470"></A>the earth some of the stars are hidden from it. Now the light of those 
<A NAME="471"></A>on which the sun shines is invisible, being obscured by the of the sun. 
<A NAME="472"></A>But the milky way is the peculiar light of those stars which are shaded 
<A NAME="473"></A>by the earth from the sun's rays.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>This, too, is obviously impossible. The milky way is always unchanged 
<A NAME="475"></A>and among the same constellations (for it is clearly a greatest circle), 
<A NAME="476"></A>whereas, since the sun does not remain in the same place, what is hidden 
<A NAME="477"></A>from it differs at different times. Consequently with the change of the 
<A NAME="478"></A>sun's position the milky way ought to change its position too: but we find 
<A NAME="479"></A>that this does not happen. Besides, if astronomical demonstrations are 
<A NAME="480"></A>correct and the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the 
<A NAME="481"></A>distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the 
<A NAME="482"></A>sun (just as the sun is further from the earth than the moon), then the 
<A NAME="483"></A>cone made by the rays of the sun would terminate at no great distance from 
<A NAME="484"></A>the earth, and the shadow of the earth (what we call night) would not reach 
<A NAME="485"></A>the stars. On the contrary, the sun shines on all the stars and the earth 
<A NAME="486"></A>screens none of them.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>(3) There is a third theory about the milky way. Some say that 
<A NAME="488"></A>it is a reflection of our sight to the sun, just as they say that the comet 
<A NAME="489"></A>is.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR>But this too is impossible. For if the eye and the mirror and the 
<A NAME="491"></A>whole of the object were severally at rest, then the same part of the image 
<A NAME="492"></A>would appear at the same point in the mirror. But if the mirror and the 
<A NAME="493"></A>object move, keeping the same distance from the eye which is at rest, but 
<A NAME="494"></A>at different rates of speed and so not always at the same interval from 
<A NAME="495"></A>one another, then it is impossible for the same image always to appear 
<A NAME="496"></A>in the same part of the mirror. Now the constellations included in the 
<A NAME="497"></A>circle of the milky way move; and so does the sun, the object to which 
<A NAME="498"></A>our sight is reflected; but we stand still. And the distance of those two 
<A NAME="499"></A>from us is constant and uniform, but their distance from one another varies. 
<A NAME="500"></A>For the Dolphin sometimes rises at midnight, sometimes in the morning. 
<A NAME="501"></A>But in each case the same parts of the milky way are found near it. But 
<A NAME="502"></A>if it were a reflection and not a genuine affection of these this ought 
<A NAME="503"></A>not to be the case.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>Again, we can see the milky way reflected at night in water and 
<A NAME="505"></A>similar mirrors. But under these circumstances it is impossible for our 
<A NAME="506"></A>sight to be reflected to the sun.
<A NAME="507"></A><BR><BR>These considerations show that the milky way is not the path of 
<A NAME="508"></A>one of the planets, nor the light of imperceptible stars, nor a reflection. 
<A NAME="509"></A>And those are the chief theories handed down by others 
<A NAME="510"></A>hitherto.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>Let us recall our fundamental principle and then explain our views. 
<A NAME="512"></A>We have already laid down that the outermost part of what is called the 
<A NAME="513"></A>air is potentially fire and that therefore when the air is dissolved by 
<A NAME="514"></A>motion, there is separated off a kind of matter-and of this matter we assert 
<A NAME="515"></A>that comets consist. We must suppose that what happens is the same as in 
<A NAME="516"></A>the case of the comets when the matter does not form independently but 
<A NAME="517"></A>is formed by one of the fixed stars or the planets. Then these stars appear 
<A NAME="518"></A>to be fringed, because matter of this kind follows their course. In the 
<A NAME="519"></A>same way, a certain kind of matter follows the sun, and we explain the 
<A NAME="520"></A>halo as a reflection from it when the air is of the right constitution. 
<A NAME="521"></A>Now we must assume that what happens in the case of the stars severally 
<A NAME="522"></A>happens in the case of the whole of the heavens and all the upper motion. 
<A NAME="523"></A>For it is natural to suppose that, if the motion of a single star excites 
<A NAME="524"></A>a flame, that of all the stars should have a similar result, and especially 
<A NAME="525"></A>in that region in which the stars are biggest and most numerous and nearest 
<A NAME="526"></A>to one another. Now the circle of the zodiac dissolves this kind of matter 
<A NAME="527"></A>because of the motion of the sun and the planets, and for this reason most 
<A NAME="528"></A>comets are found outside the tropic circles. Again, no fringe appears round 
<A NAME="529"></A>the sun or moon: for they dissolve such matter too quickly to admit of 
<A NAME="530"></A>its formation. But this circle in which the milky way appears to our sight 
<A NAME="531"></A>is the greatest circle, and its position is such that it extends far outside 
<A NAME="532"></A>the tropic circles. Besides the region is full of the biggest and brightest 
<A NAME="533"></A>constellations and also of what called 'scattered' stars (you have only 
<A NAME="534"></A>to look to see this clearly). So for these reasons all this matter is continually 
<A NAME="535"></A>and ceaselessly collecting there. A proof of the theory is this: In the 
<A NAME="536"></A>circle itself the light is stronger in that half where the milky way is 
<A NAME="537"></A>divided, and in it the constellations are more numerous and closer to one 
<A NAME="538"></A>another than in the other half; which shows that the cause of the light 
<A NAME="539"></A>is the motion of the constellations and nothing else. For if it is found 
<A NAME="540"></A>in the circle in which there are most constellations and at that point 
<A NAME="541"></A>in the circle at which they are densest and contain the biggest and the 
<A NAME="542"></A>most stars, it is natural to suppose that they are the true cause of the 
<A NAME="543"></A>affection in question. The circle and the constellations in it may be seen 
<A NAME="544"></A>in the diagram. The so-called 'scattered' stars it is not possible to set 
<A NAME="545"></A>down in the same way on the sphere because none of them have an evident 
<A NAME="546"></A>permanent position; but if you look up to the sky the point is clear. For 
<A NAME="547"></A>in this circle alone are the intervals full of these stars: in the other 
<A NAME="548"></A>circles there are obvious gaps. Hence if we accept the cause assigned for 
<A NAME="549"></A>the appearance of comets as plausible we must assume that the same kind 
<A NAME="550"></A>of thing holds good of the milky way. For the fringe which in the former 
<A NAME="551"></A>case is an affection of a single star here forms in the same way in relation 
<A NAME="552"></A>to a whole circle. So if we are to define the milky way we may call it 
<A NAME="553"></A>'a fringe attaching to the greatest circle, and due to the matter secreted'. 
<A NAME="554"></A>This, as we said before, explains why there are few comets and why they 
<A NAME="555"></A>appear rarely; it is because at each revolution of the heavens this matter 
<A NAME="556"></A>has always been and is always being separated off and gathered into this 
<A NAME="557"></A>region.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>We have now explained the phenomena that occur in that part of 
<A NAME="559"></A>the terrestrial world which is continuous with the motions of the heavens, 
<A NAME="560"></A>namely, shooting-stars and the burning flame, comets and the milky way, 
<A NAME="561"></A>these being the chief affections that appear in that 
<A NAME="562"></A>region.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="563"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>Let us go on to treat of the region which follows next in order 
<A NAME="565"></A>after this and which immediately surrounds the earth. It is the region 
<A NAME="566"></A>common to water and air, and the processes attending the formation of water 
<A NAME="567"></A>above take place in it. We must consider the principles and causes of all 
<A NAME="568"></A>these phenomena too as before. The efficient and chief and first cause 
<A NAME="569"></A>is the circle in which the sun moves. For the sun as it approaches or recedes, 
<A NAME="570"></A>obviously causes dissipation and condensation and so gives rise to generation 
<A NAME="571"></A>and destruction. Now the earth remains but the moisture surrounding it 
<A NAME="572"></A>is made to evaporate by the sun's rays and the other heat from above, and 
<A NAME="573"></A>rises. But when the heat which was raising it leaves it, in part dispersing 
<A NAME="574"></A>to the higher region, in part quenched through rising so far into the upper 
<A NAME="575"></A>air, then the vapour cools because its heat is gone and because the place 
<A NAME="576"></A>is cold, and condenses again and turns from air into water. And after the 
<A NAME="577"></A>water has formed it falls down again to the earth.
<A NAME="578"></A><BR><BR>The exhalation of water is vapour: air condensing into water is 
<A NAME="579"></A>cloud. Mist is what is left over when a cloud condenses into water, and 
<A NAME="580"></A>is therefore rather a sign of fine weather than of rain; for mist might 
<A NAME="581"></A>be called a barren cloud. So we get a circular process that follows the 
<A NAME="582"></A>course of the sun. For according as the sun moves to this side or that, 
<A NAME="583"></A>the moisture in this process rises or falls. We must think of it as a river 
<A NAME="584"></A>flowing up and down in a circle and made up partly of air, partly of water. 
<A NAME="585"></A>When the sun is near, the stream of vapour flows upwards; when it recedes, 
<A NAME="586"></A>the stream of water flows down: and the order of sequence, at all events, 
<A NAME="587"></A>in this process always remains the same. So if 'Oceanus' had some secret 
<A NAME="588"></A>meaning in early writers, perhaps they may have meant this river that flows 
<A NAME="589"></A>in a circle about the earth.
<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>So the moisture is always raised by the heat and descends to the 
<A NAME="591"></A>earth again when it gets cold. These processes and, in some cases, their 
<A NAME="592"></A>varieties are distinguished by special names. When the water falls in small 
<A NAME="593"></A>drops it is called a drizzle; when the drops are larger it is 
<A NAME="594"></A>rain.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="595"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>Some of the vapour that is formed by day does not rise high because 
<A NAME="597"></A>the ratio of the fire that is raising it to the water that is being raised 
<A NAME="598"></A>is small. When this cools and descends at night it is called dew and hoar-frost. 
<A NAME="599"></A>When the vapour is frozen before it has condensed to water again it is 
<A NAME="600"></A>hoar-frost; and this appears in winter and is commoner in cold places. 
<A NAME="601"></A>It is dew when the vapour has condensed into water and the heat is not 
<A NAME="602"></A>so great as to dry up the moisture that has been raised nor the cold sufficient 
<A NAME="603"></A>(owing to the warmth of the climate or season) for the vapour itself to 
<A NAME="604"></A>freeze. For dew is more commonly found when the season or the place is 
<A NAME="605"></A>warm, whereas the opposite, as has been said, is the case with hoar-frost. 
<A NAME="606"></A>For obviously vapour is warmer than water, having still the fire that raised 
<A NAME="607"></A>it: consequently more cold is needed to freeze it.
<A NAME="608"></A><BR><BR>Both dew and hoar-frost are found when the sky is clear and there 
<A NAME="609"></A>is no wind. For the vapour could not be raised unless the sky were clear, 
<A NAME="610"></A>and if a wind were blowing it could not condense.
<A NAME="611"></A><BR><BR>The fact that hoar-frost is not found on mountains contributes 
<A NAME="612"></A>to prove that these phenomena occur because the vapour does not rise high. 
<A NAME="613"></A>One reason for this is that it rises from hollow and watery places, so 
<A NAME="614"></A>that the heat that is raising it, bearing as it were too heavy a burden 
<A NAME="615"></A>cannot lift it to a great height but soon lets it fall again. A second 
<A NAME="616"></A>reason is that the motion of the air is more pronounced at a height, and 
<A NAME="617"></A>this dissolves a gathering of this kind.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR>Everywhere, except in Pontus, dew is found with south winds and 
<A NAME="619"></A>not with north winds. There the opposite is the case and it is found with 
<A NAME="620"></A>north winds and not with south. The reason is the same as that which explains 
<A NAME="621"></A>why dew is found in warm weather and not in cold. For the south wind brings 
<A NAME="622"></A>warm, and the north, wintry weather. For the north wind is cold and so 
<A NAME="623"></A>quenches the heat of the evaporation. But in Pontus the south wind does 
<A NAME="624"></A>not bring warmth enough to cause evaporation, whereas the coldness of the 
<A NAME="625"></A>north wind concentrates the heat by a sort of recoil, so that there is 
<A NAME="626"></A>more evaporation and not less. This is a thing which we can often observe 
<A NAME="627"></A>in other places too. Wells, for instance, give off more vapour in a north 
<A NAME="628"></A>than in a south wind. Only the north winds quench the heat before any considerable 
<A NAME="629"></A>quantity of vapour has gathered, while in a south wind the evaporation 
<A NAME="630"></A>is allowed to accumulate.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>Water, once formed, does not freeze on the surface of the earth, 
<A NAME="632"></A>in the way that it does in the region of the clouds.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="633"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR>From the latter there fall three bodies condensed by cold, namely 
<A NAME="635"></A>rain, snow, hail. Two of these correspond to the phenomena on the lower 
<A NAME="636"></A>level and are due to the same causes, differing from them only in degree 
<A NAME="637"></A>and quantity.
<A NAME="638"></A><BR><BR>Snow and hoar-frost are one and the same thing, and so are rain 
<A NAME="639"></A>and dew: only there is a great deal of the former and little of the latter. 
<A NAME="640"></A>For rain is due to the cooling of a great amount of vapour, for the region 
<A NAME="641"></A>from which and the time during which the vapour is collected are considerable. 
<A NAME="642"></A>But of dew there is little: for the vapour collects for it in a single 
<A NAME="643"></A>day and from a small area, as its quick formation and scanty quantity 
<A NAME="644"></A>show.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR>The relation of hoar-frost and snow is the same: when cloud freezes 
<A NAME="646"></A>there is snow, when vapour freezes there is hoar-frost. Hence snow is a 
<A NAME="647"></A>sign of a cold season or country. For a great deal of heat is still present 
<A NAME="648"></A>and unless the cold were overpowering it the cloud would not freeze. For 
<A NAME="649"></A>there still survives in it a great deal of the heat which caused the moisture 
<A NAME="650"></A>to rise as vapour from the earth.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR>Hail on the other hand is found in the upper region, but the corresponding 
<A NAME="652"></A>phenomenon in the vaporous region near the earth is lacking. For, as we 
<A NAME="653"></A>said, to snow in the upper region corresponds hoar-frost in the lower, 
<A NAME="654"></A>and to rain in the upper region, dew in the lower. But there is nothing 
<A NAME="655"></A>here to correspond to hail in the upper region. Why this is so will be 
<A NAME="656"></A>clear when we have explained the nature of hail.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="657"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>But we must go on to collect the facts bearing on the origin of 
<A NAME="659"></A>it, both those which raise no difficulties and those which seem 
<A NAME="660"></A>paradoxical.
<A NAME="661"></A><BR><BR>Hail is ice, and water freezes in winter; yet hailstorms occur 
<A NAME="662"></A>chiefly in spring and autumn and less often in the late summer, but rarely 
<A NAME="663"></A>in winter and then only when the cold is less intense. And in general hailstorms 
<A NAME="664"></A>occur in warmer, and snow in colder places. Again, there is a difficulty 
<A NAME="665"></A>about water freezing in the upper region. It cannot have frozen before 
<A NAME="666"></A>becoming water: and water cannot remain suspended in the air for any space 
<A NAME="667"></A>of time. Nor can we say that the case is like that of particles of moisture 
<A NAME="668"></A>which are carried up owing to their small size and rest on the iar (the 
<A NAME="669"></A>water swimming on the air just as small particles of earth and gold often 
<A NAME="670"></A>swim on water). In that case large drops are formed by the union of many 
<A NAME="671"></A>small, and so fall down. This cannot take place in the case of hail, since 
<A NAME="672"></A>solid bodies cannot coalesce like liquid ones. Clearly then drops of that 
<A NAME="673"></A>size were suspended in the air or else they could not have been so large 
<A NAME="674"></A>when frozen.
<A NAME="675"></A><BR><BR>Some think that the cause and origin of hail is this. The cloud 
<A NAME="676"></A>is thrust up into the upper atmosphere, which is colder because the reflection 
<A NAME="677"></A>of the sun's rays from the earth ceases there, and upon its arrival there 
<A NAME="678"></A>the water freezes. They think that this explains why hailstorms are commoner 
<A NAME="679"></A>in summer and in warm countries; the heat is greater and it thrusts the 
<A NAME="680"></A>clouds further up from the earth. But the fact is that hail does not occur 
<A NAME="681"></A>at all at a great height: yet it ought to do so, on their theory, just 
<A NAME="682"></A>as we see that snow falls most on high mountains. Again clouds have often 
<A NAME="683"></A>been observed moving with a great noise close to the earth, terrifying 
<A NAME="684"></A>those who heard and saw them as portents of some catastrophe. Sometimes, 
<A NAME="685"></A>too, when such clouds have been seen, without any noise, there follows 
<A NAME="686"></A>a violent hailstorm, and the stones are of incredible size, and angular 
<A NAME="687"></A>in shape. This shows that they have not been falling for long and that 
<A NAME="688"></A>they were frozen near to the earth, and not as that theory would have it. 
<A NAME="689"></A>Moreover, where the hailstones are large, the cause of their freezing must 
<A NAME="690"></A>be present in the highest degree: for hail is ice as every one can see. 
<A NAME="691"></A>Now those hailstones are large which are angular in shape. And this shows 
<A NAME="692"></A>that they froze close to the earth, for those that fall far are worn away 
<A NAME="693"></A>by the length of their fall and become round and smaller in 
<A NAME="694"></A>size.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>It clearly follows that the congelation does not take place because 
<A NAME="696"></A>the cloud is thrust up into the cold upper region.
<A NAME="697"></A><BR><BR>Now we see that warm and cold react upon one another by recoil. 
<A NAME="698"></A>Hence in warm weather the lower parts of the earth are cold and in a frost 
<A NAME="699"></A>they are warm. The same thing, we must suppose, happens in the air, so 
<A NAME="700"></A>that in the warmer seasons the cold is concentrated by the surrounding 
<A NAME="701"></A>heat and causes the cloud to go over into water suddenly. (For this reason 
<A NAME="702"></A>rain-drops are much larger on warm days than in winter, and showers more 
<A NAME="703"></A>violent. A shower is said to be more violent in proportion as the water 
<A NAME="704"></A>comes down in a body, and this happens when the condensation takes place 
<A NAME="705"></A>quickly,-though this is just the opposite of what Anaxagoras says. He says 
<A NAME="706"></A>that this happens when the cloud has risen into the cold air; whereas we 
<A NAME="707"></A>say that it happens when the cloud has descended into the warm air, and 
<A NAME="708"></A>that the more the further the cloud has descended). But when the cold has 
<A NAME="709"></A>been concentrated within still more by the outer heat, it freezes the water 
<A NAME="710"></A>it has formed and there is hail. We get hail when the process of freezing 
<A NAME="711"></A>is quicker than the descent of the water. For if the water falls in a certain 
<A NAME="712"></A>time and the cold is sufficient to freeze it in less, there is no difficulty 
<A NAME="713"></A>about its having frozen in the air, provided that the freezing takes place 
<A NAME="714"></A>in a shorter time than its fall. The nearer to the earth, and the more 
<A NAME="715"></A>suddenly, this process takes place, the more violent is the rain that results 
<A NAME="716"></A>and the larger the raindrops and the hailstones because of the shortness 
<A NAME="717"></A>of their fall. For the same reason large raindrops do not fall thickly. 
<A NAME="718"></A>Hail is rarer in summer than in spring and autumn, though commoner than 
<A NAME="719"></A>in winter, because the air is drier in summer, whereas in spring it is 
<A NAME="720"></A>still moist, and in autumn it is beginning to grow moist. It is for the 
<A NAME="721"></A>same reason that hailstorms sometimes occur in the late summer as we have 
<A NAME="722"></A>said.
<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>The fact that the water has previously been warmed contributes 
<A NAME="724"></A>to its freezing quickly: for so it cools sooner. Hence many people, when 
<A NAME="725"></A>they want to cool hot water quickly, begin by putting it in the sun. So 
<A NAME="726"></A>the inhabitants of Pontus when they encamp on the ice to fish (they cut 
<A NAME="727"></A>a hole in the ice and then fish) pour warm water round their reeds that 
<A NAME="728"></A>it may freeze the quicker, for they use the ice like lead to fix the reeds. 
<A NAME="729"></A>Now it is in hot countries and seasons that the water which forms soon 
<A NAME="730"></A>grows warm.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>It is for the same reason that rain falls in summer and not in 
<A NAME="732"></A>winter in Arabia and Ethiopia too, and that in torrents and repeatedly 
<A NAME="733"></A>on the same day. For the concentration or recoil due to the extreme heat 
<A NAME="734"></A>of the country cools the clouds quickly.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR><BR>So much for an account of the nature and causes of rain, dew, snow, 
<A NAME="736"></A>hoar-frost, and hail.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="737"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>Let us explain the nature of winds, and all windy vapours, also 
<A NAME="739"></A>of rivers and of the sea. But here, too, we must first discuss the difficulties 
<A NAME="740"></A>involved: for, as in other matters, so in this no theory has been handed 
<A NAME="741"></A>down to us that the most ordinary man could not have thought 
<A NAME="742"></A>of.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR>Some say that what is called air, when it is in motion and flows, 
<A NAME="744"></A>is wind, and that this same air when it condenses again becomes cloud and 
<A NAME="745"></A>water, implying that the nature of wind and water is the same. So they 
<A NAME="746"></A>define wind as a motion of the air. Hence some, wishing to say a clever 
<A NAME="747"></A>thing, assert that all the winds are one wind, because the air that moves 
<A NAME="748"></A>is in fact all of it one and the same; they maintain that the winds appear 
<A NAME="749"></A>to differ owing to the region from which the air may happen to flow on 
<A NAME="750"></A>each occasion, but really do not differ at all. This is just like thinking 
<A NAME="751"></A>that all rivers are one and the same river, and the ordinary unscientific 
<A NAME="752"></A>view is better than a scientific theory like this. If all rivers flow from 
<A NAME="753"></A>one source, and the same is true in the case of the winds, there might 
<A NAME="754"></A>be some truth in this theory; but if it is no more true in the one case 
<A NAME="755"></A>than in the other, this ingenious idea is plainly false. What requires 
<A NAME="756"></A>investigation is this: the nature of wind and how it originates, its efficient 
<A NAME="757"></A>cause and whence they derive their source; whether one ought to think of 
<A NAME="758"></A>the wind as issuing from a sort of vessel and flowing until the vessel 
<A NAME="759"></A>is empty, as if let out of a wineskin, or, as painters represent the winds, 
<A NAME="760"></A>as drawing their source from themselves.
<A NAME="761"></A><BR><BR>We find analogous views about the origin of rivers. It is thought 
<A NAME="762"></A>that the water is raised by the sun and descends in rain and gathers below 
<A NAME="763"></A>the earth and so flows from a great reservoir, all the rivers from one, 
<A NAME="764"></A>or each from a different one. No water at all is generated, but the volume 
<A NAME="765"></A>of the rivers consists of the water that is gathered into such reservoirs 
<A NAME="766"></A>in winter. Hence rivers are always fuller in winter than in summer, and 
<A NAME="767"></A>some are perennial, others not. Rivers are perennial where the reservoir 
<A NAME="768"></A>is large and so enough water has collected in it to last out and not be 
<A NAME="769"></A>used up before the winter rain returns. Where the reservoirs are smaller 
<A NAME="770"></A>there is less water in the rivers, and they are dried up and their vessel 
<A NAME="771"></A>empty before the fresh rain comes on.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR><BR>But if any one will picture to himself a reservoir adequate to 
<A NAME="773"></A>the water that is continuously flowing day by day, and consider the amount 
<A NAME="774"></A>of the water, it is obvious that a receptacle that is to contain all the 
<A NAME="775"></A>water that flows in the year would be larger than the earth, or, at any 
<A NAME="776"></A>rate, not much smaller.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR><BR>Though it is evident that many reservoirs of this kind do exist 
<A NAME="778"></A>in many parts of the earth, yet it is unreasonable for any one to refuse 
<A NAME="779"></A>to admit that air becomes water in the earth for the same reason as it 
<A NAME="780"></A>does above it. If the cold causes the vaporous air to condense into water 
<A NAME="781"></A>above the earth we must suppose the cold in the earth to produce this same 
<A NAME="782"></A>effect, and recognize that there not only exists in it and flows out of 
<A NAME="783"></A>it actually formed water, but that water is continually forming in it 
<A NAME="784"></A>too.
<A NAME="785"></A><BR><BR>Again, even in the case of the water that is not being formed from 
<A NAME="786"></A>day to day but exists as such, we must not suppose as some do that rivers 
<A NAME="787"></A>have their source in definite subterranean lakes. On the contrary, just 
<A NAME="788"></A>as above the earth small drops form and these join others, till finally 
<A NAME="789"></A>the water descends in a body as rain, so too we must suppose that in the 
<A NAME="790"></A>earth the water at first trickles together little by little, and that the 
<A NAME="791"></A>sources of the rivers drip, as it were, out of the earth and then unite. 
<A NAME="792"></A>This is proved by facts. When men construct an aqueduct they collect the 
<A NAME="793"></A>water in pipes and trenches, as if the earth in the higher ground were 
<A NAME="794"></A>sweating the water out. Hence, too, the head-waters of rivers are found 
<A NAME="795"></A>to flow from mountains, and from the greatest mountains there flow the 
<A NAME="796"></A>most numerous and greatest rivers. Again, most springs are in the neighbourhood 
<A NAME="797"></A>of mountains and of high ground, whereas if we except rivers, water rarely 
<A NAME="798"></A>appears in the plains. For mountains and high ground, suspended over the 
<A NAME="799"></A>country like a saturated sponge, make the water ooze out and trickle together 
<A NAME="800"></A>in minute quantities but in many places. They receive a great deal of water 
<A NAME="801"></A>falling as rain (for it makes no difference whether a spongy receptacle 
<A NAME="802"></A>is concave and turned up or convex and turned down: in either case it will 
<A NAME="803"></A>contain the same volume of matter) and, they also cool the vapour that 
<A NAME="804"></A>rises and condense it back into water.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>Hence, as we said, we find that the greatest rivers flow from the 
<A NAME="806"></A>greatest mountains. This can be seen by looking at itineraries: what is 
<A NAME="807"></A>recorded in them consists either of things which the writer has seen himself 
<A NAME="808"></A>or of such as he has compiled after inquiry from those who have seen 
<A NAME="809"></A>them.
<A NAME="810"></A><BR><BR>In Asia we find that the most numerous and greatest rivers flow 
<A NAME="811"></A>from the mountain called Parnassus, admittedly the greatest of all mountains 
<A NAME="812"></A>towards the south-east. When you have crossed it you see the outer ocean, 
<A NAME="813"></A>the further limit of which is unknown to the dwellers in our world. Besides 
<A NAME="814"></A>other rivers there flow from it the Bactrus, the Choaspes, the Araxes: 
<A NAME="815"></A>from the last a branch separates off and flows into lake Maeotis as the 
<A NAME="816"></A>Tanais. From it, too, flows the Indus, the volume of whose stream is greatest 
<A NAME="817"></A>of all rivers. From the Caucasus flows the Phasis, and very many other 
<A NAME="818"></A>great rivers besides. Now the Caucasus is the greatest of the mountains 
<A NAME="819"></A>that lie to the northeast, both as regards its extent and its height. A 
<A NAME="820"></A>proof of its height is the fact that it can be seen from the so-called 
<A NAME="821"></A>'deeps' and from the entrance to the lake. Again, the sun shines on its 
<A NAME="822"></A>peaks for a third part of the night before sunrise and again after sunset. 
<A NAME="823"></A>Its extent is proved by the fact that thought contains many inhabitable 
<A NAME="824"></A>regions which are occupied by many nations and in which there are said 
<A NAME="825"></A>to be great lakes, yet they say that all these regions are visible up to 
<A NAME="826"></A>the last peak. From Pyrene (this is a mountain towards the west in Celtice) 
<A NAME="827"></A>there flow the Istrus and the Tartessus. The latter flows outside the pillars, 
<A NAME="828"></A>while the Istrus flows through all Europe into the Euxine. Most of the 
<A NAME="829"></A>remaining rivers flow northwards from the Hercynian mountains, which are 
<A NAME="830"></A>the greatest in height and extent about that region. In the extreme north, 
<A NAME="831"></A>beyond furthest Scythia, are the mountains called Rhipae. The stories about 
<A NAME="832"></A>their size are altogether too fabulous: however, they say that the most 
<A NAME="833"></A>and (after the Istrus) the greatest rivers flow from them. So, too, in 
<A NAME="834"></A>Libya there flow from the Aethiopian mountains the Aegon and the Nyses; 
<A NAME="835"></A>and from the so-called Silver Mountain the two greatest of named rivers, 
<A NAME="836"></A>the river called Chremetes that flows into the outer ocean, and the main 
<A NAME="837"></A>source of the Nile. Of the rivers in the Greek world, the Achelous flows 
<A NAME="838"></A>from Pindus, the Inachus from the same mountain; the Strymon, the Nestus, 
<A NAME="839"></A>and the Hebrus all three from Scombrus; many rivers, too, flow from 
<A NAME="840"></A>Rhodope.
<A NAME="841"></A><BR><BR>All other rivers would be found to flow in the same way, but we 
<A NAME="842"></A>have mentioned these as examples. Even where rivers flow from marshes, 
<A NAME="843"></A>the marshes in almost every case are found to lie below mountains or gradually 
<A NAME="844"></A>rising ground.
<A NAME="845"></A><BR><BR>It is clear then that we must not suppose rivers to originate from 
<A NAME="846"></A>definite reservoirs: for the whole earth, we might almost say, would not 
<A NAME="847"></A>be sufficient (any more than the region of the clouds would be) if we were 
<A NAME="848"></A>to suppose that they were fed by actually existing water only and it were 
<A NAME="849"></A>not the case that as some water passed out of existence some more came 
<A NAME="850"></A>into existence, but rivers always drew their stream from an existing store. 
<A NAME="851"></A>Secondly, the fact that rivers rise at the foot of mountains proves that 
<A NAME="852"></A>a place transmits the water it contains by gradual percolation of many 
<A NAME="853"></A>drops, little by little, and that this is how the sources of rivers originate. 
<A NAME="854"></A>However, there is nothing impossible about the existence of such places 
<A NAME="855"></A>containing a quantity of water like lakes: only they cannot be big enough 
<A NAME="856"></A>to produce the supposed effect. To think that they are is just as absurd 
<A NAME="857"></A>as if one were to suppose that rivers drew all their water from the sources 
<A NAME="858"></A>we see (for most rivers do flow from springs). So it is no more reasonable 
<A NAME="859"></A>to suppose those lakes to contain the whole volume of water than these 
<A NAME="860"></A>springs.
<A NAME="861"></A><BR><BR>That there exist such chasms and cavities in the earth we are taught 
<A NAME="862"></A>by the rivers that are swallowed up. They are found in many parts of the 
<A NAME="863"></A>earth: in the Peloponnesus, for instance, there are many such rivers in 
<A NAME="864"></A>Arcadia. The reason is that Arcadia is mountainous and there are no channels 
<A NAME="865"></A>from its valleys to the sea. So these places get full of water, and this, 
<A NAME="866"></A>having no outlet, under the pressure of the water that is added above, 
<A NAME="867"></A>finds a way out for itself underground. In Greece this kind of thing happens 
<A NAME="868"></A>on quite a small scale, but the lake at the foot of the Caucasus, which 
<A NAME="869"></A>the inhabitants of these parts call a sea, is considerable. Many great 
<A NAME="870"></A>rivers fall into it and it has no visible outlet but issues below the earth 
<A NAME="871"></A>off the land of the Coraxi about the so-called 'deeps of Pontus'. This 
<A NAME="872"></A>is a place of unfathomable depth in the sea: at any rate no one has yet 
<A NAME="873"></A>been able to find bottom there by sounding. At this spot, about three hundred 
<A NAME="874"></A>stadia from land, there comes up sweet water over a large area, not all 
<A NAME="875"></A>of it together but in three places. And in Liguria a river equal in size 
<A NAME="876"></A>to the Rhodanus is swallowed up and appears again elsewhere: the Rhodanus 
<A NAME="877"></A>being a navigable river.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="878"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="879"></A><BR><BR>The same parts of the earth are not always moist or dry, but they 
<A NAME="880"></A>change according as rivers come into existence and dry up. And so the relation 
<A NAME="881"></A>of land to sea changes too and a place does not always remain land or sea 
<A NAME="882"></A>throughout all time, but where there was dry land there comes to be sea, 
<A NAME="883"></A>and where there is now sea, there one day comes to be dry land. But we 
<A NAME="884"></A>must suppose these changes to follow some order and cycle. The principle 
<A NAME="885"></A>and cause of these changes is that the interior of the earth grows and 
<A NAME="886"></A>decays, like the bodies of plants and animals. Only in the case of these 
<A NAME="887"></A>latter the process does not go on by parts, but each of them necessarily 
<A NAME="888"></A>grows or decays as a whole, whereas it does go on by parts in the case 
<A NAME="889"></A>of the earth. Here the causes are cold and heat, which increase and diminish 
<A NAME="890"></A>on account of the sun and its course. It is owing to them that the parts 
<A NAME="891"></A>of the earth come to have a different character, that some parts remain 
<A NAME="892"></A>moist for a certain time, and then dry up and grow old, while other parts 
<A NAME="893"></A>in their turn are filled with life and moisture. Now when places become 
<A NAME="894"></A>drier the springs necessarily give out, and when this happens the rivers 
<A NAME="895"></A>first decrease in size and then finally become dry; and when rivers change 
<A NAME="896"></A>and disappear in one part and come into existence correspondingly in another, 
<A NAME="897"></A>the sea must needs be affected.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR><BR>If the sea was once pushed out by rivers and encroached upon the 
<A NAME="899"></A>land anywhere, it necessarily leaves that place dry when it recedes; again, 
<A NAME="900"></A>if the dry land has encroached on the sea at all by a process of silting 
<A NAME="901"></A>set up by the rivers when at their full, the time must come when this place 
<A NAME="902"></A>will be flooded again.
<A NAME="903"></A><BR><BR>But the whole vital process of the earth takes place so gradually 
<A NAME="904"></A>and in periods of time which are so immense compared with the length of 
<A NAME="905"></A>our life, that these changes are not observed, and before their course 
<A NAME="906"></A>can be recorded from beginning to end whole nations perish and are destroyed. 
<A NAME="907"></A>Of such destructions the most utter and sudden are due to wars; but pestilence 
<A NAME="908"></A>or famine cause them too. Famines, again, are either sudden and severe 
<A NAME="909"></A>or else gradual. In the latter case the disappearance of a nation is not 
<A NAME="910"></A>noticed because some leave the country while others remain; and this goes 
<A NAME="911"></A>on until the land is unable to maintain any inhabitants at all. So a long 
<A NAME="912"></A>period of time is likely to elapse from the first departure to the last, 
<A NAME="913"></A>and no one remembers and the lapse of time destroys all record even before 
<A NAME="914"></A>the last inhabitants have disappeared. In the same way a nation must be 
<A NAME="915"></A>supposed to lose account of the time when it first settled in a land that 
<A NAME="916"></A>was changing from a marshy and watery state and becoming dry. Here, too, 
<A NAME="917"></A>the change is gradual and lasts a long time and men do not remember who 
<A NAME="918"></A>came first, or when, or what the land was like when they came. This has 
<A NAME="919"></A>been the case with Egypt. Here it is obvious that the land is continually 
<A NAME="920"></A>getting drier and that the whole country is a deposit of the river Nile. 
<A NAME="921"></A>But because the neighbouring peoples settled in the land gradually as the 
<A NAME="922"></A>marshes dried, the lapse of time has hidden the beginning of the process. 
<A NAME="923"></A>However, all the mouths of the Nile, with the single exception of that 
<A NAME="924"></A>at Canopus, are obviously artificial and not natural. And Egypt was nothing 
<A NAME="925"></A>more than what is called Thebes, as Homer, too, shows, modern though he 
<A NAME="926"></A>is in relation to such changes. For Thebes is the place that he mentions; 
<A NAME="927"></A>which implies that Memphis did not yet exist, or at any rate was not as 
<A NAME="928"></A>important as it is now. That this should be so is natural, since the lower 
<A NAME="929"></A>land came to be inhabited later than that which lay higher. For the parts 
<A NAME="930"></A>that lie nearer to the place where the river is depositing the silt are 
<A NAME="931"></A>necessarily marshy for a longer time since the water always lies most in 
<A NAME="932"></A>the newly formed land. But in time this land changes its character, and 
<A NAME="933"></A>in its turn enjoys a period of prosperity. For these places dry up and 
<A NAME="934"></A>come to be in good condition while the places that were formerly well-tempered 
<A NAME="935"></A>some day grow excessively dry and deteriorate. This happened to the land 
<A NAME="936"></A>of Argos and Mycenae in Greece. In the time of the Trojan wars the Argive 
<A NAME="937"></A>land was marshy and could only support a small population, whereas the 
<A NAME="938"></A>land of Mycenae was in good condition (and for this reason Mycenae was 
<A NAME="939"></A>the superior). But now the opposite is the case, for the reason we have 
<A NAME="940"></A>mentioned: the land of Mycenae has become completely dry and barren, while 
<A NAME="941"></A>the Argive land that was formerly barren owing to the water has now become 
<A NAME="942"></A>fruitful. Now the same process that has taken place in this small district 
<A NAME="943"></A>must be supposed to be going on over whole countries and on a large 
<A NAME="944"></A>scale.
<A NAME="945"></A><BR><BR>Men whose outlook is narrow suppose the cause of such events to 
<A NAME="946"></A>be change in the universe, in the sense of a coming to be of the world 
<A NAME="947"></A>as a whole. Hence they say that the sea being dried up and is growing less, 
<A NAME="948"></A>because this is observed to have happened in more places now than formerly. 
<A NAME="949"></A>But this is only partially true. It is true that many places are now dry, 
<A NAME="950"></A>that formerly were covered with water. But the opposite is true too: for 
<A NAME="951"></A>if they look they will find that there are many places where the sea has 
<A NAME="952"></A>invaded the land. But we must not suppose that the cause of this is that 
<A NAME="953"></A>the world is in process of becoming. For it is absurd to make the universe 
<A NAME="954"></A>to be in process because of small and trifling changes, when the bulk and 
<A NAME="955"></A>size of the earth are surely as nothing in comparison with the whole world. 
<A NAME="956"></A>Rather we must take the cause of all these changes to be that, just as 
<A NAME="957"></A>winter occurs in the seasons of the year, so in determined periods there 
<A NAME="958"></A>comes a great winter of a great year and with it excess of rain. But this 
<A NAME="959"></A>excess does not always occur in the same place. The deluge in the time 
<A NAME="960"></A>of Deucalion, for instance, took place chiefly in the Greek world and in 
<A NAME="961"></A>it especially about ancient Hellas, the country about Dodona and the Achelous, 
<A NAME="962"></A>a river which has often changed its course. Here the Selli dwelt and those 
<A NAME="963"></A>who were formerly called Graeci and now Hellenes. When, therefore, such 
<A NAME="964"></A>an excess of rain occurs we must suppose that it suffices for a long time. 
<A NAME="965"></A>We have seen that some say that the size of the subterranean cavities is 
<A NAME="966"></A>what makes some rivers perennial and others not, whereas we maintain that 
<A NAME="967"></A>the size of the mountains is the cause, and their density and coldness; 
<A NAME="968"></A>for great, dense, and cold mountains catch and keep and create most water: 
<A NAME="969"></A>whereas if the mountains that overhang the sources of rivers are small 
<A NAME="970"></A>or porous and stony and clayey, these rivers run dry earlier. We must recognize 
<A NAME="971"></A>the same kind of thing in this case too. Where such abundance of rain falls 
<A NAME="972"></A>in the great winter it tends to make the moisture of those places almost 
<A NAME="973"></A>everlasting. But as time goes on places of the latter type dry up more, 
<A NAME="974"></A>while those of the former, moist type, do so less: until at last the beginning 
<A NAME="975"></A>of the same cycle returns.
<A NAME="976"></A><BR><BR>Since there is necessarily some change in the whole world, but 
<A NAME="977"></A>not in the way of coming into existence or perishing (for the universe 
<A NAME="978"></A>is permanent), it must be, as we say, that the same places are not for 
<A NAME="979"></A>ever moist through the presence of sea and rivers, nor for ever dry. And 
<A NAME="980"></A>the facts prove this. The whole land of the Egyptians, whom we take to 
<A NAME="981"></A>be the most ancient of men, has evidently gradually come into existence 
<A NAME="982"></A>and been produced by the river. This is clear from an observation of the 
<A NAME="983"></A>country, and the facts about the Red Sea suffice to prove it too. One of 
<A NAME="984"></A>their kings tried to make a canal to it (for it would have been of no little 
<A NAME="985"></A>advantage to them for the whole region to have become navigable; Sesostris 
<A NAME="986"></A>is said to have been the first of the ancient kings to try), but he found 
<A NAME="987"></A>that the sea was higher than the land. So he first, and Darius afterwards, 
<A NAME="988"></A>stopped making the canal, lest the sea should mix with the river water 
<A NAME="989"></A>and spoil it. So it is clear that all this part was once unbroken sea. 
<A NAME="990"></A>For the same reason Libya-the country of Ammon-is, strangely enough, lower 
<A NAME="991"></A>and hollower than the land to the seaward of it. For it is clear that a 
<A NAME="992"></A>barrier of silt was formed and after it lakes and dry land, but in course 
<A NAME="993"></A>of time the water that was left behind in the lakes dried up and is now 
<A NAME="994"></A>all gone. Again the silting up of the lake Maeotis by the rivers has advanced 
<A NAME="995"></A>so much that the limit to the size of the ships which can now sail into 
<A NAME="996"></A>it to trade is much lower than it was sixty years ago. Hence it is easy 
<A NAME="997"></A>to infer that it, too, like most lakes, was originally produced by the 
<A NAME="998"></A>rivers and that it must end by drying up entirely.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR><BR>Again, this process of silting up causes a continuous current through 
<A NAME="1000"></A>the Bosporus; and in this case we can directly observe the nature of the 
<A NAME="1001"></A>process. Whenever the current from the Asiatic shore threw up a sandbank, 
<A NAME="1002"></A>there first formed a small lake behind it. Later it dried up and a second 
<A NAME="1003"></A>sandbank formed in front of the first and a second lake. This process went 
<A NAME="1004"></A>on uniformly and without interruption. Now when this has been repeated 
<A NAME="1005"></A>often enough, in the course of time the strait must become like a river, 
<A NAME="1006"></A>and in the end the river itself must dry up.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR><BR>So it is clear, since there will be no end to time and the world 
<A NAME="1008"></A>is eternal, that neither the Tanais nor the Nile has always been flowing, 
<A NAME="1009"></A>but that the region whence they flow was once dry: for their effect may 
<A NAME="1010"></A>be fulfilled, but time cannot. And this will be equally true of all other 
<A NAME="1011"></A>rivers. But if rivers come into existence and perish and the same parts 
<A NAME="1012"></A>of the earth were not always moist, the sea must needs change correspondingly. 
<A NAME="1013"></A>And if the sea is always advancing in one place and receding in another 
<A NAME="1014"></A>it is clear that the same parts of the whole earth are not always either 
<A NAME="1015"></A>sea or land, but that all this changes in course of 
<A NAME="1016"></A>time.
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR><BR>So we have explained that the same parts of the earth are not always 
<A NAME="1018"></A>land or sea and why that is so: and also why some rivers are perennial 
<A NAME="1019"></A>and others not.
