<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Now that we have stated the magnitudes, the properties, and the relative 
<A NAME="12"></A>differences of the other internal organs, it remains for us to treat of 
<A NAME="13"></A>the organs that contribute to generation. These organs in the female are 
<A NAME="14"></A>in all cases internal; in the male they present numerous 
<A NAME="15"></A>diversities.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>In the blooded animals some males are altogether devoid of testicles, 
<A NAME="17"></A>and some have the organ but situated internally; and of those males that 
<A NAME="18"></A>have the organ internally situated, some have it close to the loin in the 
<A NAME="19"></A>neighbourhood of the kidney and others close to the belly. Other males 
<A NAME="20"></A>have the organ situated externally. In the case of these last, the penis 
<A NAME="21"></A>is in some cases attached to the belly, whilst in others it is loosely 
<A NAME="22"></A>suspended, as is the case also with the testicles; and, in the cases where 
<A NAME="23"></A>the penis is attached to the belly, the attachment varies accordingly as 
<A NAME="24"></A>the animal is emprosthuretic or opisthuretic.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>No fish is furnished with testicles, nor any other creature that 
<A NAME="26"></A>has gills, nor any serpent whatever: nor, in short, any animal devoid of 
<A NAME="27"></A>feet, save such only as are viviparous within themselves. Birds are furnished 
<A NAME="28"></A>with testicles, but these are internally situated, close to the loin. The 
<A NAME="29"></A>case is similar with oviparous quadrupeds, such as the lizard, the tortoise 
<A NAME="30"></A>and the crocodile; and among the viviparous animals this peculiarity is 
<A NAME="31"></A>found in the hedgehog. Others among those creatures that have the organ 
<A NAME="32"></A>internally situated have it close to the belly, as is the case with the 
<A NAME="33"></A>dolphin amongst animals devoid of feet, and with the elephant among viviparous 
<A NAME="34"></A>quadrupeds. In other cases these organs are externally 
<A NAME="35"></A>conspicuous.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>We have already alluded to the diversities observed in the attachment 
<A NAME="37"></A>of these organs to the belly and the adjacent region; in other words, we 
<A NAME="38"></A>have stated that in some cases the testicles are tightly fastened back, 
<A NAME="39"></A>as in the pig and its allies, and that in others they are freely suspended, 
<A NAME="40"></A>as in man.
<A NAME="41"></A><BR><BR>Fishes, then, are devoid of testicles, as has been stated, and 
<A NAME="42"></A>serpents also. They are furnished, however, with two ducts connected with 
<A NAME="43"></A>the midriff and running on to either side of the backbone, coalescing into 
<A NAME="44"></A>a single duct above the outlet of the residuum, and by 'above' the outlet 
<A NAME="45"></A>I mean the region near to the spine. These ducts in the rutting season 
<A NAME="46"></A>get filled with the genital fluid, and, if the ducts be squeezed, the sperm 
<A NAME="47"></A>oozes out white in colour. As to the differences observed in male fishes 
<A NAME="48"></A>of diverse species, the reader should consult my treatise on Anatomy, and 
<A NAME="49"></A>the subject will be hereafter more fully discussed when we describe the 
<A NAME="50"></A>specific character in each case.
<A NAME="51"></A><BR><BR>The males of oviparous animals, whether biped or quadruped, are 
<A NAME="52"></A>in all cases furnished with testicles close to the loin underneath the 
<A NAME="53"></A>midriff. With some animals the organ is whitish, in others somewhat of 
<A NAME="54"></A>a sallow hue; in all cases it is entirely enveloped with minute and delicate 
<A NAME="55"></A>veins. From each of the two testicles extends a duct, and, as in the case 
<A NAME="56"></A>of fishes, the two ducts coalesce into one above the outlet of the residuum. 
<A NAME="57"></A>This constitutes the penis, which organ in the case of small ovipara is 
<A NAME="58"></A>inconspicuous; but in the case of the larger ovipara, as in the goose and 
<A NAME="59"></A>the like, the organ becomes quite visible just after 
<A NAME="60"></A>copulation.
<A NAME="61"></A><BR><BR>The ducts in the case of fishes and in biped and quadruped ovipara 
<A NAME="62"></A>are attached to the loin under the stomach and the gut, in betwixt them 
<A NAME="63"></A>and the great vein, from which ducts or blood-vessels extend, one to each 
<A NAME="64"></A>of the two testicles. And just as with fishes the male sperm is found in 
<A NAME="65"></A>the seminal ducts, and the ducts become plainly visible at the rutting 
<A NAME="66"></A>season and in some instances become invisible after the season is passed, 
<A NAME="67"></A>so also is it with the testicles of birds; before the breeding season the 
<A NAME="68"></A>organ is small in some birds and quite invisible in others, but during 
<A NAME="69"></A>the season the organ in all cases is greatly enlarged. This phenomenon 
<A NAME="70"></A>is remarkably illustrated in the ring-dove and the partridge, so much so 
<A NAME="71"></A>that some people are actually of opinion that these birds are devoid of 
<A NAME="72"></A>the organ in the winter-time.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Of male animals that have their testicles placed frontwards, some 
<A NAME="74"></A>have them inside, close to the belly, as the dolphin; some have them outside, 
<A NAME="75"></A>exposed to view, close to the lower extremity of the belly. These animals 
<A NAME="76"></A>resemble one another thus far in respect to this organ; but they differ 
<A NAME="77"></A>from one another in this fact, that some of them have their testicles situated 
<A NAME="78"></A>separately by themselves, while others, which have the organ situated externally, 
<A NAME="79"></A>have them enveloped in what is termed the scrotum.
<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>Again, in all viviparous animals furnished with feet the following 
<A NAME="81"></A>properties are observed in the testicles themselves. From the aorta there 
<A NAME="82"></A>extend vein-like ducts to the head of each of the testicles, and another 
<A NAME="83"></A>two from the kidneys; these two from the kidneys are supplied with blood, 
<A NAME="84"></A>while the two from the aorta are devoid of it. From the head of the testicle 
<A NAME="85"></A>alongside of the testicle itself is a duct, thicker and more sinewy than 
<A NAME="86"></A>the other just alluded to-a duct that bends back again at the end of the 
<A NAME="87"></A>testicle to its head; and from the head of each of the two testicles the 
<A NAME="88"></A>two ducts extend until they coalesce in front at the penis. The duct that 
<A NAME="89"></A>bends back again and that which is in contact with the testicle are enveloped 
<A NAME="90"></A>in one and the same membrane, so that, until you draw aside the membrane, 
<A NAME="91"></A>they present all the appearance of being a single undifferentiated duct. 
<A NAME="92"></A>Further, the duct in contact with the testicle has its moist content qualified 
<A NAME="93"></A>by blood, but to a comparatively less extent than in the case of the ducts 
<A NAME="94"></A>higher up which are connected with the aorta; in the ducts that bend back 
<A NAME="95"></A>towards the tube of the penis, the liquid is white-coloured. There also 
<A NAME="96"></A>runs a duct from the bladder, opening into the upper part of the canal, 
<A NAME="97"></A>around which lies, sheathwise, what is called the 'penis'.
<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>All these descriptive particulars may be regarded by the light 
<A NAME="99"></A>of the accompanying diagram; wherein the letter A marks the starting-point 
<A NAME="100"></A>of the ducts that extend from the aorta; the letters KK mark the heads 
<A NAME="101"></A>of the testicles and the ducts descending thereunto; the ducts extending 
<A NAME="102"></A>from these along the testicles are marked MM; the ducts turning back, in 
<A NAME="103"></A>which is the white fluid, are marked BB; the penis D; the bladder E; and 
<A NAME="104"></A>the testicles XX.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>(By the way, when the testicles are cut off or removed, the ducts 
<A NAME="106"></A>draw upwards by contraction. Moreover, when male animals are young, their 
<A NAME="107"></A>owner sometimes destroys the organ in them by attrition; sometimes they 
<A NAME="108"></A>castrate them at a later period. And I may here add, that a bull has been 
<A NAME="109"></A>known to serve a cow immediately after castration, and actually to impregnate 
<A NAME="110"></A>her.)
<A NAME="111"></A><BR><BR>So much then for the properties of testicles in male 
<A NAME="112"></A>animals.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR>In female animals furnished with a womb, the womb is not in all cases 
<A NAME="114"></A>the same in form or endowed with the same properties, but both in the vivipara 
<A NAME="115"></A>and the ovipara great diversities present themselves. In all creatures 
<A NAME="116"></A>that have the womb close to the genitals, the womb is two-horned, and one 
<A NAME="117"></A>horn lies to the right-hand side and the other to the left; its commencement, 
<A NAME="118"></A>however, is single, and so is the orifice, resembling in the case of the 
<A NAME="119"></A>most numerous and largest animals a tube composed of much flesh and gristle. 
<A NAME="120"></A>Of these parts one is termed the hystera or delphys, whence is derived 
<A NAME="121"></A>the word adelphos, and the other part, the tube or orifice, is termed metra. 
<A NAME="122"></A>In all biped or quadruped vivipara the womb is in all cases below the midriff, 
<A NAME="123"></A>as in man, the dog, the pig, the horse, and the ox; the same is the case 
<A NAME="124"></A>also in all horned animals. At the extremity of the so-called ceratia, 
<A NAME="125"></A>or horns, the wombs of most animals have a twist or 
<A NAME="126"></A>convolution.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>In the case of those ovipara that lay eggs externally, the wombs 
<A NAME="128"></A>are not in all cases similarly situated. Thus the wombs of birds are close 
<A NAME="129"></A>to the midriff, and the wombs of fishes down below, just like the wombs 
<A NAME="130"></A>of biped and quadruped vivipara, only that, in the case of the fish, the 
<A NAME="131"></A>wombs are delicately formed, membranous, and elongated; so much so that 
<A NAME="132"></A>in extremely small fish, each of the two bifurcated parts looks like a 
<A NAME="133"></A>single egg, and those fishes whose egg is described as crumbling would 
<A NAME="134"></A>appear to have inside them a pair of eggs, whereas in reality each of the 
<A NAME="135"></A>two sides consists not of one but of many eggs, and this accounts for their 
<A NAME="136"></A>breaking up into so many particles.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>The womb of birds has the lower and tubular portion fleshy and 
<A NAME="138"></A>firm, and the part close to the midriff membranous and exceedingly thin 
<A NAME="139"></A>and fine: so thin and fine that the eggs might seem to be outside the womb 
<A NAME="140"></A>altogether. In the larger birds the membrane is more distinctly visible, 
<A NAME="141"></A>and, if inflated through the tube, lifts and swells out; in the smaller 
<A NAME="142"></A>birds all these parts are more indistinct.
<A NAME="143"></A><BR><BR>The properties of the womb are similar in oviparous quadrupeds, 
<A NAME="144"></A>as the tortoise, the lizard, the frog and the like; for the tube below 
<A NAME="145"></A>is single and fleshy, and the cleft portion with the eggs is at the top 
<A NAME="146"></A>close to the midriff. With animals devoid of feet that are internally oviparous 
<A NAME="147"></A>and viviparous externally, as is the case with the dogfish and the other 
<A NAME="148"></A>so-called Selachians (and by this title we designate such creatures destitute 
<A NAME="149"></A>of feet and furnished with gills as are viviparous), with these animals 
<A NAME="150"></A>the womb is bifurcate, and beginning down below it extends as far as the 
<A NAME="151"></A>midriff, as in the case of birds. There is also a narrow part between the 
<A NAME="152"></A>two horns running up as far as the midriff, and the eggs are engendered 
<A NAME="153"></A>here and above at the origin of the midriff; afterwards they pass into 
<A NAME="154"></A>the wider space and turn from eggs into young animals. However, the differences 
<A NAME="155"></A>in respect to the wombs of these fishes as compared with others of their 
<A NAME="156"></A>own species or with fishes in general, would be more satisfactorily studied 
<A NAME="157"></A>in their various forms in specimens under dissection.
<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>The members of the serpent genus also present divergencies either 
<A NAME="159"></A>when compared with the above-mentioned creatures or with one another. Serpents 
<A NAME="160"></A>as a rule are oviparous, the viper being the only viviparous member of 
<A NAME="161"></A>the genus. The viper is, previously to external parturition, oviparous 
<A NAME="162"></A>internally; and owing to this perculiarity the properties of the womb in 
<A NAME="163"></A>the viper are similar to those of the womb in the selachians. The womb 
<A NAME="164"></A>of the serpent is long, in keeping with the body, and starting below from 
<A NAME="165"></A>a single duct extends continuously on both sides of the spine, so as to 
<A NAME="166"></A>give the impression of thus being a separate duct on each side of the spine, 
<A NAME="167"></A>until it reaches the midriff, where the eggs are engendered in a row; and 
<A NAME="168"></A>these eggs are laid not one by one, but all strung together. (And all animals 
<A NAME="169"></A>that are viviparous both internally and externally have the womb situated 
<A NAME="170"></A>above the stomach, and all the ovipara underneath, near to the loin. Animals 
<A NAME="171"></A>that are viviparous externally and internally oviparous present an intermediate 
<A NAME="172"></A>arrangement; for the underneath portion of the womb, in which the eggs 
<A NAME="173"></A>are, is placed near to the loin, but the part about the orifice is above 
<A NAME="174"></A>the gut.)
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>Further, there is the following diversity observable in wombs as 
<A NAME="176"></A>compared with one another: namely that the females of horned nonambidental 
<A NAME="177"></A>animals are furnished with cotyledons in the womb when they are pregnant, 
<A NAME="178"></A>and such is the case, among ambidentals, with the hare, the mouse, and 
<A NAME="179"></A>the bat; whereas all other animals that are ambidental, viviparous, and 
<A NAME="180"></A>furnished with feet, have the womb quite smooth, and in their case the 
<A NAME="181"></A>attachment of the embryo is to the womb itself and not to any cotyledon 
<A NAME="182"></A>inside it.
<A NAME="183"></A><BR><BR>The parts, then, in animals that are not homogeneous with themselves 
<A NAME="184"></A>and uniform in their texture, both parts external and parts internal, have 
<A NAME="185"></A>the properties above assigned to them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="186"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>In sanguineous animals the homogeneous or uniform part most universally 
<A NAME="188"></A>found is the blood, and its habitat the vein; next in degree of universality, 
<A NAME="189"></A>their analogues, lymph and fibre, and, that which chiefly constitutes the 
<A NAME="190"></A>frame of animals, flesh and whatsoever in the several parts is analogous 
<A NAME="191"></A>to flesh; then bone, and parts that are analogous to bone, as fish-bone 
<A NAME="192"></A>and gristle; and then, again, skin, membrane, sinew, hair, nails, and whatever 
<A NAME="193"></A>corresponds to these; and, furthermore, fat, suet, and the excretions: 
<A NAME="194"></A>and the excretions are dung, phlegm, yellow bile, and black 
<A NAME="195"></A>bile.
<A NAME="196"></A><BR><BR>Now, as the nature of blood and the nature of the veins have all 
<A NAME="197"></A>the appearance of being primitive, we must discuss their properties first 
<A NAME="198"></A>of all, and all the more as some previous writers have treated them very 
<A NAME="199"></A>unsatisfactorily. And the cause of the ignorance thus manifested is the 
<A NAME="200"></A>extreme difficulty experienced in the way of observation. For in the dead 
<A NAME="201"></A>bodies of animals the nature of the chief veins is undiscoverable, owing 
<A NAME="202"></A>to the fact that they collapse at once when the blood leaves them; for 
<A NAME="203"></A>the blood pours out of them in a stream, like liquid out of a vessel, since 
<A NAME="204"></A>there is no blood separately situated by itself, except a little in the 
<A NAME="205"></A>heart, but it is all lodged in the veins. In living animals it is impossible 
<A NAME="206"></A>to inspect these parts, for of their very nature they are situated inside 
<A NAME="207"></A>the body and out of sight. For this reason anatomists who have carried 
<A NAME="208"></A>on their investigations on dead bodies in the dissecting room have failed 
<A NAME="209"></A>to discover the chief roots of the veins, while those who have narrowly 
<A NAME="210"></A>inspected bodies of living men reduced to extreme attenuation have arrived 
<A NAME="211"></A>at conclusions regarding the origin of the veins from the manifestations 
<A NAME="212"></A>visible externally. Of these investigators, Syennesis, the physician of 
<A NAME="213"></A>Cyprus, writes as follows:-
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>'The big veins run thus:-from the navel across the loins, along 
<A NAME="215"></A>the back, past the lung, in under the breasts; one from right to left, 
<A NAME="216"></A>and the other from left to right; that from the left, through the liver 
<A NAME="217"></A>to the kidney and the testicle, that from the right, to the spleen and 
<A NAME="218"></A>kidney and testicle, and from thence to the penis.' Diogenes of Apollonia 
<A NAME="219"></A>writes thus:-
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>'The veins in man are as follows:-There are two veins pre-eminent 
<A NAME="221"></A>in magnitude. These extend through the belly along the backbone, one to 
<A NAME="222"></A>right, one to left; either one to the leg on its own side, and upwards 
<A NAME="223"></A>to the head, past the collar bones, through the throat. From these, veins 
<A NAME="224"></A>extend all over the body, from that on the right hand to the right side 
<A NAME="225"></A>and from that on the left hand to the left side; the most important ones, 
<A NAME="226"></A>two in number, to the heart in the region of the backbone; other two a 
<A NAME="227"></A>little higher up through the chest in underneath the armpit, each to the 
<A NAME="228"></A>hand on its side: of these two, one being termed the vein splenitis, and 
<A NAME="229"></A>the other the vein hepatitis. Each of the pair splits at its extremity; 
<A NAME="230"></A>the one branches in the direction of the thumb and the other in the direction 
<A NAME="231"></A>of the palm; and from these run off a number of minute veins branching 
<A NAME="232"></A>off to the fingers and to all parts of the hand. Other veins, more minute, 
<A NAME="233"></A>extend from the main veins; from that on the right towards the liver, from 
<A NAME="234"></A>that on the left towards the spleen and the kidneys. The veins that run 
<A NAME="235"></A>to the legs split at the juncture of the legs with the trunk and extend 
<A NAME="236"></A>right down the thigh. The largest of these goes down the thigh at the back 
<A NAME="237"></A>of it, and can be discerned and traced as a big one; the second one runs 
<A NAME="238"></A>inside the thigh, not quite as big as the one just mentioned. After this 
<A NAME="239"></A>they pass on along the knee to the shin and the foot (as the upper veins 
<A NAME="240"></A>were described as passing towards the hands), and arrive at the sole of 
<A NAME="241"></A>the foot, and from thence continue to the toes. Moreover, many delicate 
<A NAME="242"></A>veins separate off from the great veins towards the stomach and towards 
<A NAME="243"></A>the ribs.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>'The veins that run through the throat to the head can be discerned 
<A NAME="245"></A>and traced in the neck as large ones; and from each one of the two, where 
<A NAME="246"></A>it terminates, there branch off a number of veins to the head; some from 
<A NAME="247"></A>the right side towards the left, and some from the left side towards the 
<A NAME="248"></A>right; and the two veins terminate near to each of the two ears. There 
<A NAME="249"></A>is another pair of veins in the neck running along the big vein on either 
<A NAME="250"></A>side, slightly less in size than the pair just spoken of, and with these 
<A NAME="251"></A>the greater part of the veins in the head are connected. This other pair 
<A NAME="252"></A>runs through the throat inside; and from either one of the two there extend 
<A NAME="253"></A>veins in underneath the shoulder blade and towards the hands; and these 
<A NAME="254"></A>appear alongside the veins splenitis and hepatitis as another pair of veins 
<A NAME="255"></A>smaller in size. When there is a pain near the surface of the body, the 
<A NAME="256"></A>physician lances these two latter veins; but when the pain is within and 
<A NAME="257"></A>in the region of the stomach he lances the veins splenitis and hepatitis. 
<A NAME="258"></A>And from these, other veins depart to run below the 
<A NAME="259"></A>breasts.
<A NAME="260"></A><BR><BR>'There is also another pair running on each side through the spinal 
<A NAME="261"></A>marrow to the testicles, thin and delicate. There is, further, a pair running 
<A NAME="262"></A>a little underneath the cuticle through the flesh to the kidneys, and these 
<A NAME="263"></A>with men terminate at the testicle, and with women at the womb. These veins 
<A NAME="264"></A>are termed the spermatic veins. The veins that leave the stomach are comparatively 
<A NAME="265"></A>broad just as they leave; but they become gradually thinner, until they 
<A NAME="266"></A>change over from right to left and from left to right.
<A NAME="267"></A><BR><BR>'Blood is thickest when it is imbibed by the fleshy parts; when 
<A NAME="268"></A>it is transmitted to the organs above-mentioned, it becomes thin, warm, 
<A NAME="269"></A>and frothy.'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="270"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>Such are the accounts given by Syennesis and Diogenes. Polybus 
<A NAME="272"></A>writes to the following effect:-
<A NAME="273"></A><BR><BR>'There are four pairs of veins. The first extends from the back 
<A NAME="274"></A>of the head, through the neck on the outside, past the backbone on either 
<A NAME="275"></A>side, until it reaches the loins and passes on to the legs, after which 
<A NAME="276"></A>it goes on through the shins to the outer side of the ankles and on to 
<A NAME="277"></A>the feet. And it is on this account that surgeons, for pains in the back 
<A NAME="278"></A>and loin, bleed in the ham and in the outer side of the ankle. Another 
<A NAME="279"></A>pair of veins runs from the head, past ears, through the neck; which veins 
<A NAME="280"></A>are termed the jugular veins. This pair goes on inside along the backbone, 
<A NAME="281"></A>past the muscles of the loins, on to the testicles, and onwards to the 
<A NAME="282"></A>thighs, and through the inside of the hams and through the shins down to 
<A NAME="283"></A>the inside of the ankles and to the feet; and for this reason, surgeons, 
<A NAME="284"></A>for pains in the muscles of the loins and in the testicles, bleed on the 
<A NAME="285"></A>hams and the inner side of the ankles. The third pair extends from the 
<A NAME="286"></A>temples, through the neck, in underneath the shoulder-blades, into the 
<A NAME="287"></A>lung; those from right to left going in underneath the breast and on to 
<A NAME="288"></A>the spleen and the kidney; those from left to right running from the lung 
<A NAME="289"></A>in underneath the breast and into the liver and the kidney; and both terminate 
<A NAME="290"></A>in the fundament. The fourth pair extend from the front part of the head 
<A NAME="291"></A>and the eyes in underneath the neck and the collar-bones; from thence they 
<A NAME="292"></A>stretch on through the upper part of the upper arms to the elbows and then 
<A NAME="293"></A>through the fore-arms on to the wrists and the jointings of the fingers, 
<A NAME="294"></A>and also through the lower part of the upper-arms to the armpits, and so 
<A NAME="295"></A>on, keeping above the ribs, until one of the pair reaches the spleen and 
<A NAME="296"></A>the other reaches the liver; and after this they both pass over the stomach 
<A NAME="297"></A>and terminate at the penis.'
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>The above quotations sum up pretty well the statements of all previous 
<A NAME="299"></A>writers. Furthermore, there are some writers on Natural History who have 
<A NAME="300"></A>not ventured to lay down the law in such precise terms as regards the veins, 
<A NAME="301"></A>but who all alike agree in assigning the head and the brain as the starting-point 
<A NAME="302"></A>of the veins. And in this opinion they are mistaken.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>The investigation of such a subject, as has been remarked, is one 
<A NAME="304"></A>fraught with difficulties; but, if any one be keenly interested in the 
<A NAME="305"></A>matter, his best plan will be to allow his animals to starve to emaciation, 
<A NAME="306"></A>then to strangle them on a sudden, and thereupon to prosecute his 
<A NAME="307"></A>investigations.
<A NAME="308"></A><BR><BR>We now proceed to give particulars regarding the properties and 
<A NAME="309"></A>functions of the veins. There are two blood-vessels in the thorax by the 
<A NAME="310"></A>backbone, and lying to its inner side; and of these two the larger one 
<A NAME="311"></A>is situated to the front, and the lesser one is to the rear of it; and 
<A NAME="312"></A>the larger is situated rather to the right hand side of the body, and the 
<A NAME="313"></A>lesser one to the left; and by some this vein is termed the 'aorta', from 
<A NAME="314"></A>the fact that even in dead bodies part of it is observed to be full of 
<A NAME="315"></A>air. These blood-vessels have their origins in the heart, for they traverse 
<A NAME="316"></A>the other viscera, in whatever direction they happen to run, without in 
<A NAME="317"></A>any way losing their distinctive characteristic as blood-vessels, whereas 
<A NAME="318"></A>the heart is as it were a part of them (and that too more in respect to 
<A NAME="319"></A>the frontward and larger one of the two), owing to the fact that these 
<A NAME="320"></A>two veins are above and below, with the heart lying 
<A NAME="321"></A>midway.
<A NAME="322"></A><BR><BR>The heart in all animals has cavities inside it. In the case of 
<A NAME="323"></A>the smaller animals even the largest of the chambers is scarcely discernible; 
<A NAME="324"></A>the second larger is scarcely discernible in animals of medium size; but 
<A NAME="325"></A>in the largest animals all three chambers are distinctly seen. In the heart 
<A NAME="326"></A>then (with its pointed end directed frontwards, as has been observed) the 
<A NAME="327"></A>largest of the three chambers is on the right-hand side and highest up; 
<A NAME="328"></A>the least one is on the left-hand side; and the medium-sized one lies in 
<A NAME="329"></A>betwixt the other two; and the largest one of the three chambers is a great 
<A NAME="330"></A>deal larger than either of the two others. All three, however, are connected 
<A NAME="331"></A>with passages leading in the direction of the lung, but all these communications 
<A NAME="332"></A>are indistinctly discernible by reason of their minuteness, except 
<A NAME="333"></A>one.
<A NAME="334"></A><BR><BR>The great blood-vessel, then, is attached to the biggest of the 
<A NAME="335"></A>three chambers, the one that lies uppermost and on the right-hand side; 
<A NAME="336"></A>it then extends right through the chamber, coming out as blood-vessel again; 
<A NAME="337"></A>just as though the cavity of the heart were a part of the vessel, in which 
<A NAME="338"></A>the blood broadens its channel as a river that widens out in a lake. The 
<A NAME="339"></A>aorta is attached to the middle chamber; only, by the way, it is connected 
<A NAME="340"></A>with it by much narrower pipe.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>The great blood-vessel then passes through the heart (and runs 
<A NAME="342"></A>from the heart into the aorta). The great vessel looks as though made of 
<A NAME="343"></A>membrane or skin, while the aorta is narrower than it, and is very sinewy; 
<A NAME="344"></A>and as it stretches away to the head and to the lower parts it becomes 
<A NAME="345"></A>exceedingly narrow and sinewy.
<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>First of all, then, upwards from the heart there stretches a part 
<A NAME="347"></A>of the great blood-vessel towards the lung and the attachment of the aorta, 
<A NAME="348"></A>a part consisting of a large undivided vessel. But there split off from 
<A NAME="349"></A>it two parts; one towards the lung and the other towards the backbone and 
<A NAME="350"></A>the last vertebra of the neck.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>The vessel, then, that extends to the lung, as the lung itself 
<A NAME="352"></A>is duplicate, divides at first into two; and then extends along by every 
<A NAME="353"></A>pipe and every perforation, greater along the greater ones, lesser along 
<A NAME="354"></A>the less, so continuously that it is impossible to discern a single part 
<A NAME="355"></A>wherein there is not perforation and vein; for the extremities are indistinguishable 
<A NAME="356"></A>from their minuteness, and in point of fact the whole lung appears to be 
<A NAME="357"></A>filled with blood.
<A NAME="358"></A><BR><BR>The branches of the blood-vessels lie above the tubes that extend 
<A NAME="359"></A>from the windpipe. And that vessel which extends to the vertebra of the 
<A NAME="360"></A>neck and the backbone, stretches back again along the backbone; as Homer 
<A NAME="361"></A>represents in the lines:-
<A NAME="362"></A><BR><BR><B>(Antilochus, as Thoon turned him round),</B> <B>Transpierc'd 
<A NAME="363"></A>his back with a dishonest wound;</B> <B>The hollow vein that to the neck 
<A NAME="364"></A>extends,</B> <B>Along the chine, the eager javelin rends.</B>
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>From this vessel there extend small blood-vessels at each rib and 
<A NAME="366"></A>each vertebra; and at the vertebra above the kidneys the vessel bifurcates. 
<A NAME="367"></A>And in the above way the parts branch off from the great 
<A NAME="368"></A>blood-vessel.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>But up above all these, from that part which is connected with 
<A NAME="370"></A>the heart, the entire vein branches off in two directions. For its branches 
<A NAME="371"></A>extend to the sides and to the collarbones, and then pass on, in men through 
<A NAME="372"></A>the armpits to the arms, in quadrupeds to the forelegs, in birds to the 
<A NAME="373"></A>wings, and in fishes to the upper or pectoral fins. (See diagram.) The 
<A NAME="374"></A>trunks of these veins, where they first branch off, are called the 'jugular' 
<A NAME="375"></A>veins; and, where they branch off to the neck the great vein run alongside 
<A NAME="376"></A>the windpipe; and, occasionally, if these veins are pressed externally, 
<A NAME="377"></A>men, though not actually choked, become insensible, shut their eyes, and 
<A NAME="378"></A>fall flat on the ground. Extending in the way described and keeping the 
<A NAME="379"></A>windpipe in betwixt them, they pass on until they reach the ears at the 
<A NAME="380"></A>junction of the lower jaw with the skull. Hence again they branch off into 
<A NAME="381"></A>four veins, of which one bends back and descends through the neck and the 
<A NAME="382"></A>shoulder, and meets the previous branching off of the vein at the bend 
<A NAME="383"></A>of the arm, while the rest of it terminates at the hand and fingers. (See 
<A NAME="384"></A>diagram.)
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>Each vein of the other pair stretches from the region of the ear 
<A NAME="386"></A>to the brain, and branches off in a number of fine and delicate veins into 
<A NAME="387"></A>the so-called meninx, or membrane, which surrounds the brain. The brain 
<A NAME="388"></A>itself in all animals is destitute of blood, and no vein, great or small, 
<A NAME="389"></A>holds its course therein. But of the remaining veins that branch off from 
<A NAME="390"></A>the last mentioned vein some envelop the head, others close their courses 
<A NAME="391"></A>in the organs of sense and at the roots of the teeth in veins exceedingly 
<A NAME="392"></A>fine and minute.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="393"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="394"></A><BR><BR>And in like manner the parts of the lesser one of the two chief 
<A NAME="395"></A>blood-vessels, designated the aorta, branch off, accompanying the branches 
<A NAME="396"></A>from the big vein; only that, in regard to the aorta, the passages are 
<A NAME="397"></A>less in size, and the branches very considerably less than are those of 
<A NAME="398"></A>the great vein. So much for the veins as observed in the regions above 
<A NAME="399"></A>the heart.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>The part of the great vein that lies underneath the heart extends, 
<A NAME="401"></A>freely suspended, right through the midriff, and is united both to the 
<A NAME="402"></A>aorta and the backbone by slack membranous communications. From it one 
<A NAME="403"></A>vein, short and wide, extends through the liver, and from it a number of 
<A NAME="404"></A>minute veins branch off into the liver and disappear. From the vein that 
<A NAME="405"></A>passes through the liver two branches separate off, of which one terminates 
<A NAME="406"></A>in the diaphragm or so-called midriff, and the other runs up again through 
<A NAME="407"></A>the armpit into the right arm and unites with the other veins at the inside 
<A NAME="408"></A>of the bend of the arm; and it is in consequence of this local connexion 
<A NAME="409"></A>that, when the surgeon opens this vein in the forearm, the patient is relieved 
<A NAME="410"></A>of certain pains in the liver; and from the left-hand side of it there 
<A NAME="411"></A>extends a short but thick vein to the spleen and the little veins branching 
<A NAME="412"></A>off it disappear in that organ. Another part branches off from the left-hand 
<A NAME="413"></A>side of the great vein, and ascends, by a course similar to the course 
<A NAME="414"></A>recently described, into the left arm; only that the ascending vein in 
<A NAME="415"></A>the one case is the vein that traverses the liver, while in this case it 
<A NAME="416"></A>is distinct from the vein that runs into the spleen. Again, other veins 
<A NAME="417"></A>branch off from the big vein; one to the omentum, and another to the pancreas, 
<A NAME="418"></A>from which vein run a number of veins through the mesentery. All these 
<A NAME="419"></A>veins coalesce in a single large vein, along the entire gut and stomach 
<A NAME="420"></A>to the oesophagus; about these parts there is a great ramification of branch 
<A NAME="421"></A>veins.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>As far as the kidneys, each of the two remaining undivided, the 
<A NAME="423"></A>aorta and the big vein extend; and here they get more closely attached 
<A NAME="424"></A>to the backbone, and branch off, each of the two, into a A shape, and the 
<A NAME="425"></A>big vein gets to the rear of the aorta. But the chief attachment of the 
<A NAME="426"></A>aorta to the backbone takes place in the region of the heart; and the attachment 
<A NAME="427"></A>is effected by means of minute and sinewy vessels. The aorta, just as it 
<A NAME="428"></A>draws off from the heart, is a tube of considerable volume, but, as it 
<A NAME="429"></A>advances in its course, it gets narrower and more sinewy. And from the 
<A NAME="430"></A>aorta there extend veins to the mesentery just like the veins that extend 
<A NAME="431"></A>thither from the big vein, only that the branches in the case of the aorta 
<A NAME="432"></A>are considerably less in magnitude; they are, indeed, narrow and fibrillar, 
<A NAME="433"></A>and they end in delicate hollow fibre-like veinlets.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>There is no vessel that runs from the aorta into the liver or the 
<A NAME="435"></A>spleen.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>From each of the two great blood-vessels there extend branches 
<A NAME="437"></A>to each of the two flanks, and both branches fasten on to the bone. Vessels 
<A NAME="438"></A>also extend to the kidneys from the big vein and the aorta; only that they 
<A NAME="439"></A>do not open into the cavity of the organ, but their ramifications penetrate 
<A NAME="440"></A>into its substance. From the aorta run two other ducts to the bladder, 
<A NAME="441"></A>firm and continuous; and there are other ducts from the hollow of the kidneys, 
<A NAME="442"></A>in no way communicating with the big vein. From the centre of each of the 
<A NAME="443"></A>two kidneys springs a hollow sinewy vein, running along the backbone right 
<A NAME="444"></A>through the loins; by and by each of the two veins first disappears in 
<A NAME="445"></A>its own flank, and soon afterwards reappears stretching in the direction 
<A NAME="446"></A>of the flank. The extremities of these attach to the bladder, and also 
<A NAME="447"></A>in the male to the penis and in the female to the womb. From the big vein 
<A NAME="448"></A>no vein extends to the womb, but the organ is connected with the aorta 
<A NAME="449"></A>by veins numerous and closely packed.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore, from the aorta and the great vein at the points of 
<A NAME="451"></A>divarication there branch off other veins. Some of these run to the groins-large 
<A NAME="452"></A>hollow veins-and then pass on down through the legs and terminate in the 
<A NAME="453"></A>feet and toes. And, again, another set run through the groins and the thighs 
<A NAME="454"></A>cross-garter fashion, from right to left and from left to right, and unite 
<A NAME="455"></A>in the hams with the other veins.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>In the above description we have thrown light upon the course of 
<A NAME="457"></A>the veins and their points of departure.
<A NAME="458"></A><BR><BR>In all sanguineous animals the case stands as here set forth in 
<A NAME="459"></A>regard to the points of departure and the courses of the chief veins. But 
<A NAME="460"></A>the description does not hold equally good for the entire vein-system in 
<A NAME="461"></A>all these animals. For, in point of fact, the organs are not identically 
<A NAME="462"></A>situated in them all; and, what is more, some animals are furnished with 
<A NAME="463"></A>organs of which other animals are destitute. At the same time, while the 
<A NAME="464"></A>description so far holds good, the proof of its accuracy is not equally 
<A NAME="465"></A>easy in all cases, but is easiest in the case of animals of considerable 
<A NAME="466"></A>magnitude and supplied abundantly with blood. For in little animals and 
<A NAME="467"></A>those scantily supplied with blood, either from natural and inherent causes 
<A NAME="468"></A>or from a prevalence of fat in the body, thorough accuracy in investigation 
<A NAME="469"></A>is not equally attainable; for in the latter of these creatures the passages 
<A NAME="470"></A>get clogged, like water-channels choked with slush; and the others have 
<A NAME="471"></A>a few minute fibres to serve instead of veins. But in all cases the big 
<A NAME="472"></A>vein is plainly discernible, even in creatures of insignificant 
<A NAME="473"></A>size.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="474"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR>The sinews of animals have the following properties. For these 
<A NAME="476"></A>also the point of origin is the heart; for the heart has sinews within 
<A NAME="477"></A>itself in the largest of its three chambers, and the aorta is a sinew-like 
<A NAME="478"></A>vein; in fact, at its extremity it is actually a sinew, for it is there 
<A NAME="479"></A>no longer hollow, and is stretched like the sinews where they terminate 
<A NAME="480"></A>at the jointings of the bones. Be it remembered, however, that the sinews 
<A NAME="481"></A>do not proceed in unbroken sequence from one point of origin, as do the 
<A NAME="482"></A>blood-vessels.
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>For the veins have the shape of the entire body, like a sketch 
<A NAME="484"></A>of a mannikin; in such a way that the whole frame seems to be filled up 
<A NAME="485"></A>with little veins in attenuated subjects-for the space occupied by flesh 
<A NAME="486"></A>in fat individuals is filled with little veins in thin ones-whereas the 
<A NAME="487"></A>sinews are distributed about the joints and the flexures of the bones. 
<A NAME="488"></A>Now, if the sinews were derived in unbroken sequence from a common point 
<A NAME="489"></A>of departure, this continuity would be discernible in attenuated 
<A NAME="490"></A>specimens.
<A NAME="491"></A><BR><BR>In the ham, or the part of the frame brought into full play in 
<A NAME="492"></A>the effort of leaping, is an important system of sinews; and another sinew, 
<A NAME="493"></A>a double one, is that called 'the tendon', and others are those brought 
<A NAME="494"></A>into play when a great effort of physical strength is required; that is 
<A NAME="495"></A>to say, the epitonos or back-stay and the shoulder-sinews. Other sinews, 
<A NAME="496"></A>devoid of specific designation, are situated in the region of the flexures 
<A NAME="497"></A>of the bones; for all the bones that are attached to one another are bound 
<A NAME="498"></A>together by sinews, and a great quantity of sinews are placed in the neighbourhood 
<A NAME="499"></A>of all the bones. Only, by the way, in the head there is no sinew; but 
<A NAME="500"></A>the head is held together by the sutures of the bones.
<A NAME="501"></A><BR><BR>Sinew is fissile lengthwise, but crosswise it is not easily broken, 
<A NAME="502"></A>but admits of a considerable amount of hard tension. In connexion with 
<A NAME="503"></A>sinews a liquid mucus is developed, white and glutinous, and the organ, 
<A NAME="504"></A>in fact, is sustained by it and appears to be substantially composed of 
<A NAME="505"></A>it. Now, vein may be submitted to the actual cautery, but sinew, when submitted 
<A NAME="506"></A>to such action, shrivels up altogether; and, if sinews be cut asunder, 
<A NAME="507"></A>the severed parts will not again cohere. A feeling of numbness is incidental 
<A NAME="508"></A>only to parts of the frame where sinew is situated.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>There is a very extensive system of sinews connected severally 
<A NAME="510"></A>with the feet, the hands, the ribs, the shoulder-blades, the neck, and 
<A NAME="511"></A>the arms.
<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>All animals supplied with blood are furnished with sinews; but 
<A NAME="513"></A>in the case of animals that have no flexures to their limbs, but are, in 
<A NAME="514"></A>fact, destitute of either feet or hands, the sinews are fine and inconspicuous; 
<A NAME="515"></A>and so, as might have been anticipated, the sinews in the fish are chiefly 
<A NAME="516"></A>discernible in connexion with the fin.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="517"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="518"></A><BR><BR>The ines (or fibrous connective tissue) are a something intermediate 
<A NAME="519"></A>between sinew and vein. Some of them are supplied with fluid, the lymph; 
<A NAME="520"></A>and they pass from sinew to vein and from vein to sinew. There is another 
<A NAME="521"></A>kind of ines or fibre that is found in blood, but not in the blood of all 
<A NAME="522"></A>animals alike. If this fibre be left in the blood, the blood will coagulate; 
<A NAME="523"></A>if it be removed or extracted, the blood is found to be incapable of coagulation. 
<A NAME="524"></A>While, however, this fibrous matter is found in the blood of the great 
<A NAME="525"></A>majority of animals, it is not found in all. For instance, we fail to find 
<A NAME="526"></A>it in the blood of the deer, the roe, the antelope, and some other animals; 
<A NAME="527"></A>and, owing to this deficiency of the fibrous tissue, the blood of these 
<A NAME="528"></A>animals does not coagulate to the extent observed in the blood of other 
<A NAME="529"></A>animals. The blood of the deer coagulates to about the same extent as that 
<A NAME="530"></A>of the hare: that is to the blood in either case coagulates, but not into 
<A NAME="531"></A>a stiff or jelly-like substance, like the blood of ordinary animals, but 
<A NAME="532"></A>only into a flaccid consistency like that of milk which is not subjected 
<A NAME="533"></A>to the action of rennet. The blood of the antelope admits of a firmer consistency 
<A NAME="534"></A>in coagulation; for in this respect it resembles, or only comes a little 
<A NAME="535"></A>short of, the blood of sheep. Such are the properties of vein, sinew, and 
<A NAME="536"></A>fibrous tissue.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="537"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR>The bones in animals are all connected with one single bone, and 
<A NAME="539"></A>are interconnected, like the veins, in one unbroken sequence; and there 
<A NAME="540"></A>is no instance of a bone standing apart by itself. In all animals furnished 
<A NAME="541"></A>with bones, the spine or backbone is the point of origin for the entire 
<A NAME="542"></A>osseous system. The spine is composed of vertebrae, and it extends from 
<A NAME="543"></A>the head down to the loins. The vertebrae are all perforated, and, above, 
<A NAME="544"></A>the bony portion of the head is connected with the topmost vertebrae, and 
<A NAME="545"></A>is designated the 'skull'. And the serrated lines on the skull are termed 
<A NAME="546"></A>'sutures'.
<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>The skull is not formed alike in all animals. In some animals the 
<A NAME="548"></A>skull consists of one single undivided bone, as in the case of the dog; 
<A NAME="549"></A>in others it is composite in structure, as in man; and in the human species 
<A NAME="550"></A>the suture is circular in the female, while in the male it is made up of 
<A NAME="551"></A>three separate sutures, uniting above in three-corner fashion; and instances 
<A NAME="552"></A>have been known of a man's skull being devoid of suture altogether. The 
<A NAME="553"></A>skull is composed not of four bones, but of six; two of these are in the 
<A NAME="554"></A>region of the ears, small in comparison with the other four. From the skull 
<A NAME="555"></A>extend the jaws, constituted of bone. (Animals in general move the lower 
<A NAME="556"></A>jaw; the river crocodile is the only animal that moves the upper one.) 
<A NAME="557"></A>In the jaws is the tooth-system; and the teeth are constituted of bone, 
<A NAME="558"></A>and are half-way perforated; and the bone in question is the only kind 
<A NAME="559"></A>of bone which it is found impossible to grave with a graving 
<A NAME="560"></A>tool.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR>On the upper part of the course of the backbone are the collar-bones 
<A NAME="562"></A>and the ribs. The chest rests on ribs; and these ribs meet together, whereas 
<A NAME="563"></A>the others do not; for no animal has bone in the region of the stomach. 
<A NAME="564"></A>Then come the shoulder-bones, or blade-bones, and the arm-bones connected 
<A NAME="565"></A>with these, and the bones in the hands connected with the bones of the 
<A NAME="566"></A>arms. With animals that have forelegs, the osseous system of the foreleg 
<A NAME="567"></A>resembles that of the arm in man.
<A NAME="568"></A><BR><BR>Below the level of the backbone, after the haunch-bone, comes the 
<A NAME="569"></A>hip-socket; then the leg-bones, those in the thighs and those in the shins, 
<A NAME="570"></A>which are termed colenes or limb-bones, a part of which is the ankle, while 
<A NAME="571"></A>a part of the same is the so-called 'plectrum' in those creatures that 
<A NAME="572"></A>have an ankle; and connected with these bones are the bones in the 
<A NAME="573"></A>feet.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>Now, with all animals that are supplied with blood and furnished 
<A NAME="575"></A>with feet, and are at the same time viviparous, the bones do not differ 
<A NAME="576"></A>greatly one from another, but only in the way of relative hardness, softness, 
<A NAME="577"></A>or magnitude. A further difference, by the way, is that in one and the 
<A NAME="578"></A>same animal certain bones are supplied with marrow, while others are destitute 
<A NAME="579"></A>of it. Some animals might on casual observation appear to have no marrow 
<A NAME="580"></A>whatsoever in their bones: as is the case with the lion, owing to his having 
<A NAME="581"></A>marrow only in small amount, poor and thin, and in very few bones; for 
<A NAME="582"></A>marrow is found in his thigh and armbones. The bones of the lion are exceptionally 
<A NAME="583"></A>hard; so hard, in fact, that if they are rubbed hard against one another 
<A NAME="584"></A>they emit sparks like flint-stones. The dolphin has bones, and not 
<A NAME="585"></A>fish-spine.
<A NAME="586"></A><BR><BR>Of the other animals supplied with blood, some differ but little, 
<A NAME="587"></A>as is the case with birds; others have systems analogous, as fishes; for 
<A NAME="588"></A>viviparous fishes, such as the cartilaginous species, are gristle-spined, 
<A NAME="589"></A>while the ovipara have a spine which corresponds to the backbone in quadrupeds. 
<A NAME="590"></A>This exceptional property has been observed in fishes, that in some of 
<A NAME="591"></A>them there are found delicate spines scattered here and there throughout 
<A NAME="592"></A>the fleshy parts. The serpent is similarly constructed to the fish; in 
<A NAME="593"></A>other words, his backbone is spinous. With oviparous quadrupeds, the skeleton 
<A NAME="594"></A>of the larger ones is more or less osseous; of the smaller ones, more or 
<A NAME="595"></A>less spinous. But all sanguineous animals have a backbone of either one 
<A NAME="596"></A>kind or other: that is, composed either of bone or of 
<A NAME="597"></A>spine.
<A NAME="598"></A><BR><BR>The other portions of the skeleton are found in some animals and 
<A NAME="599"></A>not found in others, but the presence or the absence of this and that part 
<A NAME="600"></A>carries with it, as a matter of course, the presence or the absence of 
<A NAME="601"></A>the bones or the spines corresponding to this or that part. For animals 
<A NAME="602"></A>that are destitute of arms and legs cannot be furnished with limb-bones: 
<A NAME="603"></A>and in like manner with animals that have the same parts, but yet have 
<A NAME="604"></A>them unlike in form; for in these animals the corresponding bones differ 
<A NAME="605"></A>from one another in the way of relative excess or relative defect, or in 
<A NAME="606"></A>the way of analogy taking the place of identity. So much for the osseous 
<A NAME="607"></A>or spinous systems in animals.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="608"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR>Gristle is of the same nature as bone, but differs from it in the 
<A NAME="610"></A>way of relative excess or relative defect. And just like bone, cartilage 
<A NAME="611"></A>also, if cut, does not grow again. In terrestrial viviparous sanguinea 
<A NAME="612"></A>the gristle formations are unperforated, and there is no marrow in them 
<A NAME="613"></A>as there is in bones; in the selachia, however--for, be it observed, they 
<A NAME="614"></A>are gristle-spined--there is found in the case of the flat space in the 
<A NAME="615"></A>region of the backbone, a gristle-like substance analogous to bone, and 
<A NAME="616"></A>in this gristle-like substance there is a liquid resembling marrow. In 
<A NAME="617"></A>viviparous animals furnished with feet, gristle formations are found in 
<A NAME="618"></A>the region of the ears, in the nostrils, and around certain extremities 
<A NAME="619"></A>of the bones.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="620"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR>Furthermore, there are parts of other kinds, neither identical 
<A NAME="622"></A>with, nor altogether diverse from, the parts above enumerated: such as 
<A NAME="623"></A>nails, hooves, claws, and horns; and also, by the way, beaks, such as birds 
<A NAME="624"></A>are furnished with-all in the several animals that are furnished therewithal. 
<A NAME="625"></A>All these parts are flexible and fissile; but bone is neither flexible 
<A NAME="626"></A>nor fissile, but frangible.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>And the colours of horns and nails and claw and hoof follow the 
<A NAME="628"></A>colour of the skin and the hair. For according as the skin of an animal 
<A NAME="629"></A>is black, or white, or of medium hue, so are the horns, the claws, or the 
<A NAME="630"></A>hooves, as the case may be, of hue to match. And it is the same with nails. 
<A NAME="631"></A>The teeth, however, follow after the bones. Thus in black men, such as 
<A NAME="632"></A>the Aethiopians and the like, the teeth and bones are white, but the nails 
<A NAME="633"></A>are black, like the whole of the skin.
<A NAME="634"></A><BR><BR>Horns in general are hollow at their point of attachment to the 
<A NAME="635"></A>bone which juts out from the head inside the horn, but they have a solid 
<A NAME="636"></A>portion at the tip, and they are simple and undivided in structure. In 
<A NAME="637"></A>the case of the stag alone of all animals the horns are solid throughout, 
<A NAME="638"></A>and ramify into branches (or antlers). And, whereas no other animal is 
<A NAME="639"></A>known to shed its horns, the deer sheds its horns annually, unless it has 
<A NAME="640"></A>been castrated; and with regard to the effects of castration in animals 
<A NAME="641"></A>we shall have much to say hereafter. Horns attach rather to the skin than 
<A NAME="642"></A>to the bone; which will account for the fact that there are found in Phrygia 
<A NAME="643"></A>and elsewhere cattle that can move their horns as freely as their 
<A NAME="644"></A>ears.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR>Of animals furnished with nails-and, by the way, all animals have 
<A NAME="646"></A>nails that have toes, and toes that have feet, except the elephant; and 
<A NAME="647"></A>the elephant has toes undivided and slightly articulated, but has no nails 
<A NAME="648"></A>whatsoever--of animals furnished with nails, some are straight-nailed, 
<A NAME="649"></A>like man; others are crooked nailed, as the lion among animals that walk, 
<A NAME="650"></A>and the eagle among animals that fly.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="651"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="652"></A><BR><BR>The following are the properties of hair and of parts analogous 
<A NAME="653"></A>to hair, and of skin or hide. All viviparous animals furnished with feet 
<A NAME="654"></A>have hair; all oviparous animals furnished with feet have horn-like tessellates; 
<A NAME="655"></A>fishes, and fishes only, have scales-that is, such oviparous fishes as 
<A NAME="656"></A>have the crumbling egg or roe. For of the lanky fishes, the conger has 
<A NAME="657"></A>no such egg, nor the muraena, and the eel has no egg at 
<A NAME="658"></A>all.
<A NAME="659"></A><BR><BR>The hair differs in the way of thickness and fineness, and of length, 
<A NAME="660"></A>according to the locality of the part in which it is found, and according 
<A NAME="661"></A>to the quality of skin or hide on which it grows. For, as a general rule, 
<A NAME="662"></A>the thicker the hide, the harder and the thicker is the hair; and the hair 
<A NAME="663"></A>is inclined to grow in abundance and to a great length in localities of 
<A NAME="664"></A>the bodies hollow and moist, if the localities be fitted for the growth 
<A NAME="665"></A>of hair at all. The facts are similar in the case of animals whether coated 
<A NAME="666"></A>with scales or with tessellates. With soft-haired animals the hair gets 
<A NAME="667"></A>harder with good feeding, and with hard-haired or bristly animals it gets 
<A NAME="668"></A>softer and scantier from the same cause. Hair differs in quality also according 
<A NAME="669"></A>to the relative heat or warmth of the locality: just as the hair in man 
<A NAME="670"></A>is hard in warm places and soft in cold ones. Again, straight hair is inclined 
<A NAME="671"></A>to be soft, and curly hair to be bristly.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="672"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="673"></A><BR><BR>Hair is naturally fissile, and in this respect it differs in degree 
<A NAME="674"></A>in diverse animals. In some animals the hair goes on gradually hardening 
<A NAME="675"></A>into bristle until it no longer resembles hair but spine, as in the case 
<A NAME="676"></A>of the hedgehog. And in like manner with the nails; for in some animals 
<A NAME="677"></A>the nail differs as regards solidity in no way from 
<A NAME="678"></A>bone.
<A NAME="679"></A><BR><BR>Of all animals man has the most delicate skin: that is, if we take 
<A NAME="680"></A>into consideration his relative size. In the skin or hide of all animals 
<A NAME="681"></A>there is a mucous liquid, scanty in some animals and plentiful in others, 
<A NAME="682"></A>as, for instance, in the hide of the ox; for men manufacture glue out of 
<A NAME="683"></A>it. (And, by the way, in some cases glue is manufactured from fishes also.) 
<A NAME="684"></A>The skin, when cut, is in itself devoid of sensation; and this is especially 
<A NAME="685"></A>the case with the skin on the head, owing to there being no flesh between 
<A NAME="686"></A>it and the skull. And wherever the skin is quite by itself, if it be cut 
<A NAME="687"></A>asunder, it does not grow together again, as is seen in the thin part of 
<A NAME="688"></A>the jaw, in the prepuce, and the eyelid. In all animals the skin is one 
<A NAME="689"></A>of the parts that extends continuous and unbroken, and it comes to a stop 
<A NAME="690"></A>only where the natural ducts pour out their contents, and at the mouth 
<A NAME="691"></A>and nails.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR><BR>All sanguineous animals, then, have skin; but not all such animals 
<A NAME="693"></A>have hair, save only under the circumstances described above. The hair 
<A NAME="694"></A>changes its colour as animals grow old, and in man it turns white or grey. 
<A NAME="695"></A>With animals, in general, the change takes place, but not very obviously, 
<A NAME="696"></A>or not so obviously as in the case of the horse. Hair turns grey from the 
<A NAME="697"></A>point backwards to the roots. But, in the majority of cases, grey hairs 
<A NAME="698"></A>are white from the beginning; and this is a proof that greyness of hair 
<A NAME="699"></A>does not, as some believe to be the case, imply withering or decrepitude, 
<A NAME="700"></A>for no part is brought into existence in a withered or decrepit 
<A NAME="701"></A>condition.
<A NAME="702"></A><BR><BR>In the eruptive malady called the white-sickness all the hairs 
<A NAME="703"></A>get grey; and instances have been known where the hair became grey while 
<A NAME="704"></A>the patients were ill of the malady, whereas the grey hairs shed off and 
<A NAME="705"></A>black ones replaced them on their recovery. (Hair is more apt to turn grey 
<A NAME="706"></A>when it is kept covered than when exposed to the action of the outer air.) 
<A NAME="707"></A>In men, the hair over the temples is the first to turn grey, and the hair 
<A NAME="708"></A>in the front grows grey sooner than the hair at the back; and the hair 
<A NAME="709"></A>on the pubes is the last to change colour.
<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR>Some hairs are congenital, others grow after the maturity of the 
<A NAME="711"></A>animal; but this occurs in man only. The congenital hairs are on the head, 
<A NAME="712"></A>the eyelids, and the eyebrows; of the later growths the hairs on the pubes 
<A NAME="713"></A>are the first to come, then those under the armpits, and, thirdly, those 
<A NAME="714"></A>on the chin; for, singularly enough, the regions where congenital growths 
<A NAME="715"></A>and the subsequent growths are found are equal in number. The hair on the 
<A NAME="716"></A>head grows scanty and sheds out to a greater extent and sooner than all 
<A NAME="717"></A>the rest. But this remark applies only to hair in front; for no man ever 
<A NAME="718"></A>gets bald at the back of his head. Smoothness on the top of the head is 
<A NAME="719"></A>termed 'baldness', but smoothness on the eyebrows is denoted by a special 
<A NAME="720"></A>term which means 'forehead-baldness'; and neither of these conditions of 
<A NAME="721"></A>baldness supervenes in a man until he shall have come under the influence 
<A NAME="722"></A>of sexual passion. For no boy ever gets bald, no woman, and no castrated 
<A NAME="723"></A>man. In fact, if a man be castrated before reaching puberty, the later 
<A NAME="724"></A>growths of hair never come at all; and, if the operation take place subsequently, 
<A NAME="725"></A>the aftergrowths, and these only, shed off; or, rather, two of the growths 
<A NAME="726"></A>shed off, but not that on the pubes.
<A NAME="727"></A><BR><BR>Women do not grow hairs on the chin; except that a scanty beard 
<A NAME="728"></A>grows on some women after the monthly courses have stopped; and similar 
<A NAME="729"></A>phenomenon is observed at times in priestesses in Caria, but these cases 
<A NAME="730"></A>are looked upon as portentous with regard to coming events. The other after-growths 
<A NAME="731"></A>are found in women, but more scanty and sparse. Men and women are at times 
<A NAME="732"></A>born constitutionally and congenitally incapable of the after-growths; 
<A NAME="733"></A>and individuals that are destitute even of the growth upon the pubes are 
<A NAME="734"></A>constitutionally impotent.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR><BR>Hair as a rule grows more or less in length as the wearer grows 
<A NAME="736"></A>in age; chiefly the hair on the head, then that in the beard, and fine 
<A NAME="737"></A>hair grows longest of all. With some people as they grow old the eyebrows 
<A NAME="738"></A>grow thicker, to such an extent that they have to be cut off; and this 
<A NAME="739"></A>growth is owing to the fact that the eyebrows are situated at a conjuncture 
<A NAME="740"></A>of bones, and these bones, as age comes on, draw apart and exude a gradual 
<A NAME="741"></A>increase of moisture or rheum. The eyelashes do not grow in size, but they 
<A NAME="742"></A>shed when the wearer comes first under the influence of sexual feelings, 
<A NAME="743"></A>and shed all the quicker as this influence is the more powerful; and these 
<A NAME="744"></A>are the last hairs to grow grey.
<A NAME="745"></A><BR><BR>Hairs if plucked out before maturity grow again; but they do not 
<A NAME="746"></A>grow again if plucked out afterwards. Every hair is supplied with a mucous 
<A NAME="747"></A>moisture at its root, and immediately after being plucked out it can lift 
<A NAME="748"></A>light articles if it touch them with this mucus.
<A NAME="749"></A><BR><BR>Animals that admit of diversity of colour in the hair admit of 
<A NAME="750"></A>a similar diversity to start with in the skin and in the cuticle of the 
<A NAME="751"></A>tongue.
<A NAME="752"></A><BR><BR>In some cases among men the upper lip and the chin is thickly covered 
<A NAME="753"></A>with hair, and in other cases these parts are smooth and the cheeks are 
<A NAME="754"></A>hairy; and, by the way, smooth-chinned men are less inclined than bearded 
<A NAME="755"></A>men to baldness.
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>The hair is inclined to grow in certain diseases, especially in 
<A NAME="757"></A>consumption, and in old age, and after death; and under these circumstances 
<A NAME="758"></A>the hair hardens concomitantly with its growth, and the same duplicate 
<A NAME="759"></A>phenomenon is observable in respect of the nails.
<A NAME="760"></A><BR><BR>In the case of men of strong sexual passions the congenital hairs 
<A NAME="761"></A>shed the sooner, while the hairs of the after-growths are the quicker to 
<A NAME="762"></A>come. When men are afflicted with varicose veins they are less inclined 
<A NAME="763"></A>to take on baldness; and if they be bald when they become thus afflicted, 
<A NAME="764"></A>they have a tendency to get their hair again.
<A NAME="765"></A><BR><BR>If a hair be cut, it does not grow at the point of section; but 
<A NAME="766"></A>it gets longer by growing upward from below. In fishes the scales grow 
<A NAME="767"></A>harder and thicker with age, and when the amimal gets emaciated or is growing 
<A NAME="768"></A>old the scales grow harder. In quadrupeds as they grow old the hair in 
<A NAME="769"></A>some and the wool in others gets deeper but scantier in amount: and the 
<A NAME="770"></A>hooves or claws get larger in size; and the same is the case with the beaks 
<A NAME="771"></A>of birds. The claws also increase in size, as do also the 
<A NAME="772"></A>nails.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="773"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="774"></A><BR><BR>With regard to winged animals, such as birds, no creature is liable 
<A NAME="775"></A>to change of colour by reason of age, excepting the crane. The wings of 
<A NAME="776"></A>this bird are ash-coloured at first, but as it grows old the wings get 
<A NAME="777"></A>black. Again, owing to special climatic influences, as when unusual frost 
<A NAME="778"></A>prevails, a change is sometimes observed to take place in birds whose plumage 
<A NAME="779"></A>is of one uniform colour; thus, birds that have dusky or downright black 
<A NAME="780"></A>plumage turn white or grey, as the raven, the sparrow, and the swallow; 
<A NAME="781"></A>but no case has ever yet been known of a change of colour from white to 
<A NAME="782"></A>black. (Further, most birds change the colour of their plumage at different 
<A NAME="783"></A>seasons of the year, so much so that a man ignorant of their habits might 
<A NAME="784"></A>be mistaken as to their identity.) Some animals change the colour of their 
<A NAME="785"></A>hair with a change in their drinking-water, for in some countries the same 
<A NAME="786"></A>species of animal is found white in one district and black in another. 
<A NAME="787"></A>And in regard to the commerce of the sexes, water in many places is of 
<A NAME="788"></A>such peculiar quality that rams, if they have intercourse with the female 
<A NAME="789"></A>after drinking it, beget black lambs, as is the case with the water of 
<A NAME="790"></A>the Psychrus (so-called from its coldness), a river in the district of 
<A NAME="791"></A>Assyritis in the Chalcidic Peninsula, on the coast of Thrace; and in Antandria 
<A NAME="792"></A>there are two rivers of which one makes the lambs white and the other black. 
<A NAME="793"></A>The river Scamander also has the reputation of making lambs yellow, and 
<A NAME="794"></A>that is the reason, they say, why Homer designates it the 'Yellow River.' 
<A NAME="795"></A>Animals as a general rule have no hair on their internal surfaces, and, 
<A NAME="796"></A>in regard to their extremities, they have hair on the upper, but not on 
<A NAME="797"></A>the lower side.
<A NAME="798"></A><BR><BR>The hare, or dasypod, is the only animal known to have hair inside 
<A NAME="799"></A>its mouth and underneath its feet. Further, the so-called mousewhale instead 
<A NAME="800"></A>of teeth has hairs in its mouth resembling pigs' bristles.
<A NAME="801"></A><BR><BR>Hairs after being cut grow at the bottom but not at the top; if 
<A NAME="802"></A>feathers be cut off, they grow neither at top nor bottom, but shed and 
<A NAME="803"></A>fall out. Further, the bee's wing will not grow again after being plucked 
<A NAME="804"></A>off, nor will the wing of any creature that has undivided wings. Neither 
<A NAME="805"></A>will the sting grow again if the bee lose it, but the creature will die 
<A NAME="806"></A>of the loss.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="807"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR>In all sanguineous animals membranes are found. And membrane resembles 
<A NAME="809"></A>a thin close-textured skin, but its qualities are different, as it admits 
<A NAME="810"></A>neither of cleavage nor of extension. Membrane envelops each one of the 
<A NAME="811"></A>bones and each one of the viscera, both in the larger and the smaller animals; 
<A NAME="812"></A>though in the smaller animals the membranes are indiscernible from their 
<A NAME="813"></A>extreme tenuity and minuteness. The largest of all the membranes are the 
<A NAME="814"></A>two that surround the brain, and of these two the one that lines the bony 
<A NAME="815"></A>skull is stronger and thicker than the one that envelops the brain; next 
<A NAME="816"></A>in order of magnitude comes the membrane that encloses the heart. If membrane 
<A NAME="817"></A>be bared and cut asunder it will not grow together again, and the bone 
<A NAME="818"></A>thus stripped of its membrane mortifies.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="819"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR>The omentum or caul, by the way, is membrane. All sanguineous animals 
<A NAME="821"></A>are furnished with this organ; but in some animals the organ is supplied 
<A NAME="822"></A>with fat, and in others it is devoid of it. The omentum has both its starting-point 
<A NAME="823"></A>and its attachment, with ambidental vivipara, in the centre of the stomach, 
<A NAME="824"></A>where the stomach has a kind of suture; in non-ambidental vivipara it has 
<A NAME="825"></A>its starting-point and attachment in the chief of the ruminating 
<A NAME="826"></A>stomachs.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="827"></A><B>Part 15</B>

<A NAME="828"></A><BR><BR>The bladder also is of the nature of membrane, but of membrane 
<A NAME="829"></A>peculiar in kind, for it is extensile. The organ is not common to all animals, 
<A NAME="830"></A>but, while it is found in all the vivipara, the tortoise is the only oviparous 
<A NAME="831"></A>animal that is furnished therewithal. The bladder, like ordinary membrane, 
<A NAME="832"></A>if cut asunder will not grow together again, unless the section be just 
<A NAME="833"></A>at the commencement of the urethra: except indeed in very rare cases, for 
<A NAME="834"></A>instances of healing have been known to occur. After death, the organ passes 
<A NAME="835"></A>no liquid excretion; but in life, in addition to the normal liquid excretion, 
<A NAME="836"></A>it passes at times dry excretion also, which turns into stones in the case 
<A NAME="837"></A>of sufferers from that malady. Indeed, instances have been known of concretions 
<A NAME="838"></A>in the bladder so shaped as closely to resemble cockleshells.
<A NAME="839"></A><BR><BR>Such are the properties, then, of vein, sinew and skin, of fibre 
<A NAME="840"></A>and membrane, of hair, nail, claw and hoof, of horns, of teeth, of beak, 
<A NAME="841"></A>of gristle, of bones, and of parts that are analogous to any of the parts 
<A NAME="842"></A>here enumerated.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="843"></A><B>Part 16</B>

<A NAME="844"></A><BR><BR>Flesh, and that which is by nature akin to it in sanguineous animals, 
<A NAME="845"></A>is in all cases situated in between the skin and the bone, or the substance 
<A NAME="846"></A>analogous to bone; for just as spine is a counterpart of bone, so is the 
<A NAME="847"></A>flesh-like substance of animals that are constructed a spinous system the 
<A NAME="848"></A>counterpart of the flesh of animals constructed on an osseous 
<A NAME="849"></A>one.
<A NAME="850"></A><BR><BR>Flesh can be divided asunder in any direction, not lengthwise only 
<A NAME="851"></A>as is the case with sinew and vein. When animals are subjected to emaciation 
<A NAME="852"></A>the flesh disappears, and the creatures become a mass of veins and fibres; 
<A NAME="853"></A>when they are over fed, fat takes the place of flesh. Where the flesh is 
<A NAME="854"></A>abundant in an animal, its veins are somewhat small and the blood abnormally 
<A NAME="855"></A>red; the viscera also and the stomach are diminutive; whereas with animals 
<A NAME="856"></A>whose veins are large the blood is somewhat black, the viscera and the 
<A NAME="857"></A>stomach are large, and the flesh is somewhat scanty. And animals with small 
<A NAME="858"></A>stomachs are disposed to take on flesh.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="859"></A><B>Part 17</B>

<A NAME="860"></A><BR><BR>Again, fat and suet differ from one another. Suet is frangible 
<A NAME="861"></A>in all directions and congeals if subjected to extreme cold, whereas fat 
<A NAME="862"></A>can melt but cannot freeze or congeal; and soups made of the flesh of animals 
<A NAME="863"></A>supplied with fat do not congeal or coagulate, as is found with horse-flesh 
<A NAME="864"></A>and pork; but soups made from the flesh of animals supplied with suet do 
<A NAME="865"></A>coagulate, as is seen with mutton and goat's flesh. Further, fat and suet 
<A NAME="866"></A>differ as to their localities: for fat is found between the skin and flesh, 
<A NAME="867"></A>but suet is found only at the limit of the fleshy parts. Also, in animals 
<A NAME="868"></A>supplied with fat the omentum or caul is supplied with fat, and it is supplied 
<A NAME="869"></A>with suet in animals supplied with suet. Moreover, ambidental animals are 
<A NAME="870"></A>supplied with fat, and non-ambidentals with suet.
<A NAME="871"></A><BR><BR>Of the viscera the liver in some animals becomes fatty, as, among 
<A NAME="872"></A>fishes, is the case with the selachia, by the melting of whose livers an 
<A NAME="873"></A>oil is manufactured. These cartilaginous fish themselves have no free fat 
<A NAME="874"></A>at all in connexion with the flesh or with the stomach. The suet in fish 
<A NAME="875"></A>is fatty, and does not solidify or congeal. All animals are furnished with 
<A NAME="876"></A>fat, either intermingled with their flesh, or apart. Such as have no free 
<A NAME="877"></A>or separate fat are less fat than others in stomach and omentum, as the 
<A NAME="878"></A>eel; for it has only a scanty supply of suet about the omentum. Most animals 
<A NAME="879"></A>take on fat in the belly, especially such animals as are little in 
<A NAME="880"></A>motion.
<A NAME="881"></A><BR><BR>The brains of animals supplied with fat are oily, as in the pig; 
<A NAME="882"></A>of animals supplied with suet, parched and dry. But it is about the kidneys 
<A NAME="883"></A>more than any other viscera that animals are inclined to take on fat; and 
<A NAME="884"></A>the right kidney is always less supplied with fat than the left kidney, 
<A NAME="885"></A>and, be the two kidneys ever so fat, there is always a space devoid of 
<A NAME="886"></A>fat in between the two. Animals supplied with suet are specially apt to 
<A NAME="887"></A>have it about the kidneys, and especially the sheep; for this animal is 
<A NAME="888"></A>apt to die from its kidneys being entirely enveloped. Fat or suet about 
<A NAME="889"></A>the kidney is superinduced by overfeeding, as is found at Leontini in Sicily; 
<A NAME="890"></A>and consequently in this district they defer driving out sheep to pasture 
<A NAME="891"></A>until the day is well on, with the view of limiting their food by curtailment 
<A NAME="892"></A>of the hours of pasture.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="893"></A><B>Part 18</B>

<A NAME="894"></A><BR><BR>The part around the pupil of the eye is fatty in all animals, and 
<A NAME="895"></A>this part resembles suet in all animals that possess such a part and that 
<A NAME="896"></A>are not furnished with hard eyes.
<A NAME="897"></A><BR><BR>Fat animals, whether male or female, are more or less unfitted 
<A NAME="898"></A>for breeding purposes. Animals are disposed to take on fat more when old 
<A NAME="899"></A>than when young, and especially when they have attained their full breadth 
<A NAME="900"></A>and their full length and are beginning to grow depthways.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="901"></A><B>Part 19</B>

<A NAME="902"></A><BR><BR>And now to proceed to the consideration of the blood. In sanguineous 
<A NAME="903"></A>animals blood is the most universal and the most indispensable part; and 
<A NAME="904"></A>it is not an acquired or adventitious part, but it is a consubstantial 
<A NAME="905"></A>part of all animals that are not corrupt or moribund. All blood is contained 
<A NAME="906"></A>in a vascular system, to wit, the veins, and is found nowhere else, excepting 
<A NAME="907"></A>in the heart. Blood is not sensitive to touch in any animal, any more than 
<A NAME="908"></A>the excretions of the stomach; and the case is similar with the brain and 
<A NAME="909"></A>the marrow. When flesh is lacerated, blood exudes, if the animal be alive 
<A NAME="910"></A>and unless the flesh be gangrened. Blood in a healthy condition is naturally 
<A NAME="911"></A>sweet to the taste, and red in colour, blood that deteriorates from natural 
<A NAME="912"></A>decay or from disease more or less black. Blood at its best, before it 
<A NAME="913"></A>undergoes deterioration from either natural decay or from disease, is neither 
<A NAME="914"></A>very thick nor very thin. In the living animal it is always liquid and 
<A NAME="915"></A>warm, but, on issuing from the body, it coagulates in all cases except 
<A NAME="916"></A>in the case of the deer, the roe, and the like animals; for, as a general 
<A NAME="917"></A>rule, blood coagulates unless the fibres be extracted. Bull's blood is 
<A NAME="918"></A>the quickest to coagulate.
<A NAME="919"></A><BR><BR>Animals that are internally and externally viviparous are more 
<A NAME="920"></A>abundantly supplied with blood than the sanguineous ovipara. Animals that 
<A NAME="921"></A>are in good condition, either from natural causes or from their health 
<A NAME="922"></A>having been attended to, have the blood neither too abundant-as creatures 
<A NAME="923"></A>just after drinking have the liquid inside them in abundance-nor again 
<A NAME="924"></A>very scanty, as is the case with animals when exceedingly fat. For animals 
<A NAME="925"></A>in this condition have pure blood, but very little of it, and the fatter 
<A NAME="926"></A>an animal gets the less becomes its supply of blood; for whatsoever is 
<A NAME="927"></A>fat is destitute of blood.
<A NAME="928"></A><BR><BR>A fat substance is incorruptible, but blood and all things containing 
<A NAME="929"></A>it corrupt rapidly, and this property characterizes especially all parts 
<A NAME="930"></A>connected with the bones. Blood is finest and purest in man; and thickest 
<A NAME="931"></A>and blackest in the bull and the ass, of all vivipara. In the lower and 
<A NAME="932"></A>the higher parts of the body blood is thicker and blacker than in the central 
<A NAME="933"></A>parts.
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR>Blood beats or palpitates in the veins of all animals alike all 
<A NAME="935"></A>over their bodies, and blood is the only liquid that permeates the entire 
<A NAME="936"></A>frames of living animals, without exception and at all times, as long as 
<A NAME="937"></A>life lasts. Blood is developed first of all in the heart of animals before 
<A NAME="938"></A>the body is differentiated as a whole. If blood be removed or if it escape 
<A NAME="939"></A>in any considerable quantity, animals fall into a faint or swoon; if it 
<A NAME="940"></A>be removed or if it escape in an exceedingly large quantity they die. If 
<A NAME="941"></A>the blood get exceedingly liquid, animals fall sick; for the blood then 
<A NAME="942"></A>turns into something like ichor, or a liquid so thin that it at times has 
<A NAME="943"></A>been known to exude through the pores like sweat. In some cases blood, 
<A NAME="944"></A>when issuing from the veins, does not coagulate at all, or only here and 
<A NAME="945"></A>there. Whilst animals are sleeping the blood is less abundantly supplied 
<A NAME="946"></A>near the exterior surfaces, so that, if the sleeping creature be pricked 
<A NAME="947"></A>with a pin, the blood does not issue as copiously as it would if the creature 
<A NAME="948"></A>were awake. Blood is developed out of ichor by coction, and fat in like 
<A NAME="949"></A>manner out of blood. If the blood get diseased, haemorrhoids may ensue 
<A NAME="950"></A>in the nostril or at the anus, or the veins may become varicose. Blood, 
<A NAME="951"></A>if it corrupt in the body, has a tendency to turn into pus, and pus may 
<A NAME="952"></A>turn into a solid concretion.
<A NAME="953"></A><BR><BR>Blood in the female differs from that in the male, for, supposing 
<A NAME="954"></A>the male and female to be on a par as regards age and general health, the 
<A NAME="955"></A>blood in the female is thicker and blacker than in the male; and with the 
<A NAME="956"></A>female there is a comparative superabundance of it in the interior. Of 
<A NAME="957"></A>all female animals the female in man is the most richly supplied with blood, 
<A NAME="958"></A>and of all female animals the menstruous discharges are the most copious 
<A NAME="959"></A>in woman. The blood of these discharges under disease turns into flux. 
<A NAME="960"></A>Apart from the menstrual discharges, the female in the human species is 
<A NAME="961"></A>less subject to diseases of the blood than the male.
<A NAME="962"></A><BR><BR>Women are seldom afflicted with varicose veins, with haemorrhoids, 
<A NAME="963"></A>or with bleeding at the nose, and, if any of these maladies supervene, 
<A NAME="964"></A>the menses are imperfectly discharged.
<A NAME="965"></A><BR><BR>Blood differs in quantity and appearance according to age; in very 
<A NAME="966"></A>young animals it resembles ichor and is abundant, in the old it is thick 
<A NAME="967"></A>and black and scarce, and in middle-aged animals its qualities are intermediate. 
<A NAME="968"></A>In old animals the blood coagulates rapidly, even blood at the surface 
<A NAME="969"></A>of the body; but this is not the case with young animals. Ichor is, in 
<A NAME="970"></A>fact, nothing else but unconcocted blood: either blood that has not yet 
<A NAME="971"></A>been concocted, or that has become fluid again.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="972"></A><B>Part 20</B>

<A NAME="973"></A><BR><BR>We now proceed to discuss the properties of marrow; for this is 
<A NAME="974"></A>one of the liquids found in certain sanguineous animals. All the natural 
<A NAME="975"></A>liquids of the body are contained in vessels: as blood in veins, marrow 
<A NAME="976"></A>in bones other moistures in membranous structures of the 
<A NAME="977"></A>skin
<A NAME="978"></A><BR><BR>In young animals the marrow is exceedingly sanguineous, but, as 
<A NAME="979"></A>animals grow old, it becomes fatty in animals supplied with fat, and suet-like 
<A NAME="980"></A>in animals with suet. All bones, however, are not supplied with marrow, 
<A NAME="981"></A>but only the hollow ones, and not all of these. For of the bones in the 
<A NAME="982"></A>lion some contain no marrow at all, and some are only scantily supplied 
<A NAME="983"></A>therewith; and that accounts, as was previously observed, for the statement 
<A NAME="984"></A>made by certain writers that the lion is marrowless. In the bones of pigs 
<A NAME="985"></A>it is found in small quantities; and in the bones of certain animals of 
<A NAME="986"></A>this species it is not found at all.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR><BR>These liquids, then, are nearly always congenital in animals, but 
<A NAME="988"></A>milk and sperm come at a later time. Of these latter, that which, whensoever 
<A NAME="989"></A>it is present, is secreted in all cases ready-made, is the milk; sperm, 
<A NAME="990"></A>on the other hand, is not secreted out in all cases, but in some only, 
<A NAME="991"></A>as in the case of what are designated thori in fishes.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR>Whatever animals have milk, have it in their breasts. All animals 
<A NAME="993"></A>have breasts that are internally and externally viviparous, as for instance 
<A NAME="994"></A>all animals that have hair, as man and the horse; and the cetaceans, as 
<A NAME="995"></A>the dolphin, the porpoise, and the whale-for these animals have breasts 
<A NAME="996"></A>and are supplied with milk. Animals that are oviparous or only externally 
<A NAME="997"></A>viviparous have neither breasts nor milk, as the fish and the 
<A NAME="998"></A>bird.
<A NAME="999"></A><BR><BR>All milk is composed of a watery serum called 'whey', and a consistent 
<A NAME="1000"></A>substance called curd (or cheese); and the thicker the milk, the more abundant 
<A NAME="1001"></A>the curd. The milk, then, of non-ambidentals coagulates, and that is why 
<A NAME="1002"></A>cheese is made of the milk of such animals under domestication; but the 
<A NAME="1003"></A>milk of ambidentals does not coagulate, nor their fat either, and the milk 
<A NAME="1004"></A>is thin and sweet. Now the camel's milk is the thinnest, and that of the 
<A NAME="1005"></A>human species next after it, and that of the ass next again, but cow's 
<A NAME="1006"></A>milk is the thickest. Milk does not coagulate under the influence of cold, 
<A NAME="1007"></A>but rather runs to whey; but under the influence of heat it coagulates 
<A NAME="1008"></A>and thickens. As a general rule milk only comes to animals in pregnancy. 
<A NAME="1009"></A>When the animal is pregnant milk is found, but for a while it is unfit 
<A NAME="1010"></A>for use, and then after an interval of usefulness it becomes unfit for 
<A NAME="1011"></A>use again. In the case of female animals not pregnant a small quantity 
<A NAME="1012"></A>of milk has been procured by the employment of special food, and cases 
<A NAME="1013"></A>have been actually known where women advanced in years on being submitted 
<A NAME="1014"></A>to the process of milking have produced milk, and in some cases have produced 
<A NAME="1015"></A>it in sufficient quantities to enable them to suckle an 
<A NAME="1016"></A>infant.
<A NAME="1017"></A><BR><BR>The people that live on and about Mount Oeta take such she-goats 
<A NAME="1018"></A>as decline the male and rub their udders hard with nettles to cause an 
<A NAME="1019"></A>irritation amounting to pain; hereupon they milk the animals, procuring 
<A NAME="1020"></A>at first a liquid resembling blood, then a liquid mixed with purulent matter, 
<A NAME="1021"></A>and eventually milk, as freely as from females submitting to the 
<A NAME="1022"></A>male.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR><BR>As a general rule, milk is not found in the male of man or of any 
<A NAME="1024"></A>other animal, though from time to time it has been found in a male; for 
<A NAME="1025"></A>instance, once in Lemnos a he-goat was milked by its dugs (for it has, 
<A NAME="1026"></A>by the way, two dugs close to the penis), and was milked to such effect 
<A NAME="1027"></A>that cheese was made of the produce, and the same phenomenon was repeated 
<A NAME="1028"></A>in a male of its own begetting. Such occurrences, however, are regarded 
<A NAME="1029"></A>as supernatural and fraught with omen as to futurity, and in point of fact 
<A NAME="1030"></A>when the Lemnian owner of the animal inquired of the oracle, the god informed 
<A NAME="1031"></A>him that the portent foreshadowed the acquisition of a fortune. With some 
<A NAME="1032"></A>men, after puberty, milk can be produced by squeezing the breasts; cases 
<A NAME="1033"></A>have been known where on their being subjected to a prolonged milking process 
<A NAME="1034"></A>a considerable quantity of milk has been educed.
<A NAME="1035"></A><BR><BR>In milk there is a fatty element, which in clotted milk gets to 
<A NAME="1036"></A>resemble oil. Goat's milk is mixed with sheep's milk in Sicily, and wherever 
<A NAME="1037"></A>sheep's milk is abundant. The best milk for clotting is not only that where 
<A NAME="1038"></A>the cheese is most abundant, but that also where the cheese is 
<A NAME="1039"></A>driest.
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR><BR>Now some animals produce not only enough milk to rear their young, 
<A NAME="1041"></A>but a superfluous amount for general use, for cheese-making and for storage. 
<A NAME="1042"></A>This is especially the case with the sheep and the goat, and next in degree 
<A NAME="1043"></A>with the cow. Mare's milk, by the way, and milk of the she-ass are mixed 
<A NAME="1044"></A>in with Phrygian cheese. And there is more cheese in cow's milk than in 
<A NAME="1045"></A>goat's milk; for graziers tell us that from nine gallons of goat's milk 
<A NAME="1046"></A>they can get nineteen cheeses at an obol apiece, and from the same amount 
<A NAME="1047"></A>of cow's milk, thirty. Other animals give only enough of milk to rear their 
<A NAME="1048"></A>young withal, and no superfluous amount and none fitted for cheese-making, 
<A NAME="1049"></A>as is the case with all animals that have more than two breasts or dugs; 
<A NAME="1050"></A>for with none of such animals is milk produced in superabundance or used 
<A NAME="1051"></A>for the manufacture of cheese.
<A NAME="1052"></A><BR><BR>The juice of the fig and rennet are employed to curdle milk. The 
<A NAME="1053"></A>fig-juice is first squeezed out into wool; the wool is then washed and 
<A NAME="1054"></A>rinsed, and the rinsing put into a little milk, and if this be mixed with 
<A NAME="1055"></A>other milk it curdles Rennet is a kind of milk, for it is found in the 
<A NAME="1056"></A>stomach of the animal while it is yet suckling.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1057"></A><B>Part 21</B>

<A NAME="1058"></A><BR><BR>Rennet then consists of milk with an admixture of fire, which comes 
<A NAME="1059"></A>from the natural heat of the animal, as the milk is concocted. All ruminating 
<A NAME="1060"></A>animals produce rennet, and, of ambidentals, the hare. Rennet improves 
<A NAME="1061"></A>in quality the longer it is kept; and cow's rennet, after being kept a 
<A NAME="1062"></A>good while, and also hare's rennet, is good for diarrhoea, and the best 
<A NAME="1063"></A>of all rennet is that of the young deer.
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR><BR>In milk-producing animals the comparative amount of the yield varies 
<A NAME="1065"></A>with the size of the animal and the diversities of pasturage. For instance, 
<A NAME="1066"></A>there are in Phasis small cattle that in all cases give a copious supply 
<A NAME="1067"></A>of milk, and the large cows in Epirus yield each one daily some nine gallons 
<A NAME="1068"></A>of milk, and half of this from each pair of teats, and the milker has to 
<A NAME="1069"></A>stand erect, stooping forward a little, as otherwise, if he were seated, 
<A NAME="1070"></A>he would be unable to reach up to the teats. But, with the exception of 
<A NAME="1071"></A>the ass, all the quadrupeds in Epirus are of large size, and relatively, 
<A NAME="1072"></A>the cattle and the dogs are the largest. Now large animals require abundant 
<A NAME="1073"></A>pasture, and this country supplies just such pasturage, and also supplies 
<A NAME="1074"></A>diverse pasture grounds to suit the diverse seasons of the year. The cattle 
<A NAME="1075"></A>are particularly large, and likewise the sheep of the so-called Pyrrhic 
<A NAME="1076"></A>breed, the name being given in honour of King Pyrrhus.
<A NAME="1077"></A><BR><BR>Some pasture quenches milk, as Median grass or lucerne, and that 
<A NAME="1078"></A>especially in ruminants; other feeding renders it copious, as cytisus and 
<A NAME="1079"></A>vetch; only, by the way, cytisus in flower is not recommended, as it has 
<A NAME="1080"></A>burning properties, and vetch is not good for pregnant kine, as it causes 
<A NAME="1081"></A>increased difficulty in parturition. However, beasts that have access to 
<A NAME="1082"></A>good feeding, as they are benefited thereby in regard to pregnancy, so 
<A NAME="1083"></A>also being well nourished produce milk in plenty. Some of the leguminous 
<A NAME="1084"></A>plants bring milk in abundance, as for instance, a large feed of beans 
<A NAME="1085"></A>with the ewe, the common she-goat, the cow, and the small she-goat; for 
<A NAME="1086"></A>this feeding makes them drop their udders. And, by the way, the pointing 
<A NAME="1087"></A>of the udder to the ground before parturition is a sign of there being 
<A NAME="1088"></A>plenty of milk coming.
<A NAME="1089"></A><BR><BR>Milk remains for a long time in the female, if she be kept from 
<A NAME="1090"></A>the male and be properly fed, and, of quadrupeds, this is especially true 
<A NAME="1091"></A>of the ewe; for the ewe can be milked for eight months. As a general rule, 
<A NAME="1092"></A>ruminating animals give milk in abundance, and milk fitted for cheese manufacture. 
<A NAME="1093"></A>In the neighbourhood of Torone cows run dry for a few days before calving, 
<A NAME="1094"></A>and have milk all the rest of the time. In women, milk of a livid colour 
<A NAME="1095"></A>is better than white for nursing purposes; and swarthy women give healthier 
<A NAME="1096"></A>milk than fair ones. Milk that is richest in cheese is the most nutritious, 
<A NAME="1097"></A>but milk with a scanty supply of cheese is the more wholesome for 
<A NAME="1098"></A>children.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1099"></A><B>Part 22</B>

<A NAME="1100"></A><BR><BR>All sanguineous animals eject sperm. As to what, and how, it contributes 
<A NAME="1101"></A>to generation, these questions will be discussed in another treatise. Taking 
<A NAME="1102"></A>the size of his body into account, man emits more sperm than any other 
<A NAME="1103"></A>animal. In hairy-coated animals the sperm is sticky, but in other animals 
<A NAME="1104"></A>it is not so. It is white in all cases, and Herodotus is under a misapprehension 
<A NAME="1105"></A>when he states that the Aethiopians eject black sperm.
<A NAME="1106"></A><BR><BR>Sperm issues from the body white and consistent, if it be healthy, 
<A NAME="1107"></A>and after quitting the body becomes thin and black. In frosty weather it 
<A NAME="1108"></A>does not coagulate, but gets exceedingly thin and watery both in colour 
<A NAME="1109"></A>and consistency; but it coagulates and thickens under the influence of 
<A NAME="1110"></A>heat. If it be long in the womb before issuing out, it comes more than 
<A NAME="1111"></A>usually thick; and sometimes it comes out dry and compact. Sperm capable 
<A NAME="1112"></A>of impregnating or of fructification sinks in water; sperm incapable Of 
<A NAME="1113"></A>producing that result dissolves away. But there is no truth in what Ctesias 
<A NAME="1114"></A>has written about the sperm of the elephant.
