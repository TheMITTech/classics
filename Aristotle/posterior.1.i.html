<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>All instruction given or received by way of argument proceeds from pre-existent 
<A NAME="12"></A>knowledge. This becomes evident upon a survey of all the species of such 
<A NAME="13"></A>instruction. The mathematical sciences and all other speculative disciplines 
<A NAME="14"></A>are acquired in this way, and so are the two forms of dialectical reasoning, 
<A NAME="15"></A>syllogistic and inductive; for each of these latter make use of old knowledge 
<A NAME="16"></A>to impart new, the syllogism assuming an audience that accepts its premisses, 
<A NAME="17"></A>induction exhibiting the universal as implicit in the clearly known particular. 
<A NAME="18"></A>Again, the persuasion exerted by rhetorical arguments is in principle the 
<A NAME="19"></A>same, since they use either example, a kind of induction, or enthymeme, 
<A NAME="20"></A>a form of syllogism.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>The pre-existent knowledge required is of two kinds. In some cases 
<A NAME="22"></A>admission of the fact must be assumed, in others comprehension of the meaning 
<A NAME="23"></A>of the term used, and sometimes both assumptions are essential. Thus, we 
<A NAME="24"></A>assume that every predicate can be either truly affirmed or truly denied 
<A NAME="25"></A>of any subject, and that 'triangle' means so and so; as regards 'unit' 
<A NAME="26"></A>we have to make the double assumption of the meaning of the word and the 
<A NAME="27"></A>existence of the thing. The reason is that these several objects are not 
<A NAME="28"></A>equally obvious to us. Recognition of a truth may in some cases contain 
<A NAME="29"></A>as factors both previous knowledge and also knowledge acquired simultaneously 
<A NAME="30"></A>with that recognition-knowledge, this latter, of the particulars actually 
<A NAME="31"></A>falling under the universal and therein already virtually known. For example, 
<A NAME="32"></A>the student knew beforehand that the angles of every triangle are equal 
<A NAME="33"></A>to two right angles; but it was only at the actual moment at which he was 
<A NAME="34"></A>being led on to recognize this as true in the instance before him that 
<A NAME="35"></A>he came to know 'this figure inscribed in the semicircle' to be a triangle. 
<A NAME="36"></A>For some things (viz. the singulars finally reached which are not predicable 
<A NAME="37"></A>of anything else as subject) are only learnt in this way, i.e. there is 
<A NAME="38"></A>here no recognition through a middle of a minor term as subject to a major. 
<A NAME="39"></A>Before he was led on to recognition or before he actually drew a conclusion, 
<A NAME="40"></A>we should perhaps say that in a manner he knew, in a manner 
<A NAME="41"></A>not.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>If he did not in an unqualified sense of the term know the existence 
<A NAME="43"></A>of this triangle, how could he know without qualification that its angles 
<A NAME="44"></A>were equal to two right angles? No: clearly he knows not without qualification 
<A NAME="45"></A>but only in the sense that he knows universally. If this distinction is 
<A NAME="46"></A>not drawn, we are faced with the dilemma in the Meno: either a man will 
<A NAME="47"></A>learn nothing or what he already knows; for we cannot accept the solution 
<A NAME="48"></A>which some people offer. A man is asked, 'Do you, or do you not, know that 
<A NAME="49"></A>every pair is even?' He says he does know it. The questioner then produces 
<A NAME="50"></A>a particular pair, of the existence, and so a fortiori of the evenness, 
<A NAME="51"></A>of which he was unaware. The solution which some people offer is to assert 
<A NAME="52"></A>that they do not know that every pair is even, but only that everything 
<A NAME="53"></A>which they know to be a pair is even: yet what they know to be even is 
<A NAME="54"></A>that of which they have demonstrated evenness, i.e. what they made the 
<A NAME="55"></A>subject of their premiss, viz. not merely every triangle or number which 
<A NAME="56"></A>they know to be such, but any and every number or triangle without reservation. 
<A NAME="57"></A>For no premiss is ever couched in the form 'every number which you know 
<A NAME="58"></A>to be such', or 'every rectilinear figure which you know to be such': the 
<A NAME="59"></A>predicate is always construed as applicable to any and every instance of 
<A NAME="60"></A>the thing. On the other hand, I imagine there is nothing to prevent a man 
<A NAME="61"></A>in one sense knowing what he is learning, in another not knowing it. The 
<A NAME="62"></A>strange thing would be, not if in some sense he knew what he was learning, 
<A NAME="63"></A>but if he were to know it in that precise sense and manner in which he 
<A NAME="64"></A>was learning it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="65"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="66"></A><BR><BR>We suppose ourselves to possess unqualified scientific knowledge 
<A NAME="67"></A>of a thing, as opposed to knowing it in the accidental way in which the 
<A NAME="68"></A>sophist knows, when we think that we know the cause on which the fact depends, 
<A NAME="69"></A>as the cause of that fact and of no other, and, further, that the fact 
<A NAME="70"></A>could not be other than it is. Now that scientific knowing is something 
<A NAME="71"></A>of this sort is evident-witness both those who falsely claim it and those 
<A NAME="72"></A>who actually possess it, since the former merely imagine themselves to 
<A NAME="73"></A>be, while the latter are also actually, in the condition described. Consequently 
<A NAME="74"></A>the proper object of unqualified scientific knowledge is something which 
<A NAME="75"></A>cannot be other than it is.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>There may be another manner of knowing as well-that will be discussed 
<A NAME="77"></A>later. What I now assert is that at all events we do know by demonstration. 
<A NAME="78"></A>By demonstration I mean a syllogism productive of scientific knowledge, 
<A NAME="79"></A>a syllogism, that is, the grasp of which is eo ipso such knowledge. Assuming 
<A NAME="80"></A>then that my thesis as to the nature of scientific knowing is correct, 
<A NAME="81"></A>the premisses of demonstrated knowledge must be true, primary, immediate, 
<A NAME="82"></A>better known than and prior to the conclusion, which is further related 
<A NAME="83"></A>to them as effect to cause. Unless these conditions are satisfied, the 
<A NAME="84"></A>basic truths will not be 'appropriate' to the conclusion. Syllogism there 
<A NAME="85"></A>may indeed be without these conditions, but such syllogism, not being productive 
<A NAME="86"></A>of scientific knowledge, will not be demonstration. The premisses must 
<A NAME="87"></A>be true: for that which is non-existent cannot be known-we cannot know, 
<A NAME="88"></A>e.g. that the diagonal of a square is commensurate with its side. The premisses 
<A NAME="89"></A>must be primary and indemonstrable; otherwise they will require demonstration 
<A NAME="90"></A>in order to be known, since to have knowledge, if it be not accidental 
<A NAME="91"></A>knowledge, of things which are demonstrable, means precisely to have a 
<A NAME="92"></A>demonstration of them. The premisses must be the causes of the conclusion, 
<A NAME="93"></A>better known than it, and prior to it; its causes, since we possess scientific 
<A NAME="94"></A>knowledge of a thing only when we know its cause; prior, in order to be 
<A NAME="95"></A>causes; antecedently known, this antecedent knowledge being not our mere 
<A NAME="96"></A>understanding of the meaning, but knowledge of the fact as well. Now 'prior' 
<A NAME="97"></A>and 'better known' are ambiguous terms, for there is a difference between 
<A NAME="98"></A>what is prior and better known in the order of being and what is prior 
<A NAME="99"></A>and better known to man. I mean that objects nearer to sense are prior 
<A NAME="100"></A>and better known to man; objects without qualification prior and better 
<A NAME="101"></A>known are those further from sense. Now the most universal causes are furthest 
<A NAME="102"></A>from sense and particular causes are nearest to sense, and they are thus 
<A NAME="103"></A>exactly opposed to one another. In saying that the premisses of demonstrated 
<A NAME="104"></A>knowledge must be primary, I mean that they must be the 'appropriate' basic 
<A NAME="105"></A>truths, for I identify primary premiss and basic truth. A 'basic truth' 
<A NAME="106"></A>in a demonstration is an immediate proposition. An immediate proposition 
<A NAME="107"></A>is one which has no other proposition prior to it. A proposition is either 
<A NAME="108"></A>part of an enunciation, i.e. it predicates a single attribute of a single 
<A NAME="109"></A>subject. If a proposition is dialectical, it assumes either part indifferently; 
<A NAME="110"></A>if it is demonstrative, it lays down one part to the definite exclusion 
<A NAME="111"></A>of the other because that part is true. The term 'enunciation' denotes 
<A NAME="112"></A>either part of a contradiction indifferently. A contradiction is an opposition 
<A NAME="113"></A>which of its own nature excludes a middle. The part of a contradiction 
<A NAME="114"></A>which conjoins a predicate with a subject is an affirmation; the part disjoining 
<A NAME="115"></A>them is a negation. I call an immediate basic truth of syllogism a 'thesis' 
<A NAME="116"></A>when, though it is not susceptible of proof by the teacher, yet ignorance 
<A NAME="117"></A>of it does not constitute a total bar to progress on the part of the pupil: 
<A NAME="118"></A>one which the pupil must know if he is to learn anything whatever is an 
<A NAME="119"></A>axiom. I call it an axiom because there are such truths and we give them 
<A NAME="120"></A>the name of axioms par excellence. If a thesis assumes one part or the 
<A NAME="121"></A>other of an enunciation, i.e. asserts either the existence or the non-existence 
<A NAME="122"></A>of a subject, it is a hypothesis; if it does not so assert, it is a definition. 
<A NAME="123"></A>Definition is a 'thesis' or a 'laying something down', since the arithmetician 
<A NAME="124"></A>lays it down that to be a unit is to be quantitatively indivisible; but 
<A NAME="125"></A>it is not a hypothesis, for to define what a unit is is not the same as 
<A NAME="126"></A>to affirm its existence.
<A NAME="127"></A><BR><BR>Now since the required ground of our knowledge-i.e. of our conviction-of 
<A NAME="128"></A>a fact is the possession of such a syllogism as we call demonstration, 
<A NAME="129"></A>and the ground of the syllogism is the facts constituting its premisses, 
<A NAME="130"></A>we must not only know the primary premisses-some if not all of them-beforehand, 
<A NAME="131"></A>but know them better than the conclusion: for the cause of an attribute's 
<A NAME="132"></A>inherence in a subject always itself inheres in the subject more firmly 
<A NAME="133"></A>than that attribute; e.g. the cause of our loving anything is dearer to 
<A NAME="134"></A>us than the object of our love. So since the primary premisses are the 
<A NAME="135"></A>cause of our knowledge-i.e. of our conviction-it follows that we know them 
<A NAME="136"></A>better-that is, are more convinced of them-than their consequences, precisely 
<A NAME="137"></A>because of our knowledge of the latter is the effect of our knowledge of 
<A NAME="138"></A>the premisses. Now a man cannot believe in anything more than in the things 
<A NAME="139"></A>he knows, unless he has either actual knowledge of it or something better 
<A NAME="140"></A>than actual knowledge. But we are faced with this paradox if a student 
<A NAME="141"></A>whose belief rests on demonstration has not prior knowledge; a man must 
<A NAME="142"></A>believe in some, if not in all, of the basic truths more than in the conclusion. 
<A NAME="143"></A>Moreover, if a man sets out to acquire the scientific knowledge that comes 
<A NAME="144"></A>through demonstration, he must not only have a better knowledge of the 
<A NAME="145"></A>basic truths and a firmer conviction of them than of the connexion which 
<A NAME="146"></A>is being demonstrated: more than this, nothing must be more certain or 
<A NAME="147"></A>better known to him than these basic truths in their character as contradicting 
<A NAME="148"></A>the fundamental premisses which lead to the opposed and erroneous conclusion. 
<A NAME="149"></A>For indeed the conviction of pure science must be unshakable.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="150"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>Some hold that, owing to the necessity of knowing the primary premisses, 
<A NAME="152"></A>there is no scientific knowledge. Others think there is, but that all truths 
<A NAME="153"></A>are demonstrable. Neither doctrine is either true or a necessary deduction 
<A NAME="154"></A>from the premisses. The first school, assuming that there is no way of 
<A NAME="155"></A>knowing other than by demonstration, maintain that an infinite regress 
<A NAME="156"></A>is involved, on the ground that if behind the prior stands no primary, 
<A NAME="157"></A>we could not know the posterior through the prior (wherein they are right, 
<A NAME="158"></A>for one cannot traverse an infinite series): if on the other hand-they 
<A NAME="159"></A>say-the series terminates and there are primary premisses, yet these are 
<A NAME="160"></A>unknowable because incapable of demonstration, which according to them 
<A NAME="161"></A>is the only form of knowledge. And since thus one cannot know the primary 
<A NAME="162"></A>premisses, knowledge of the conclusions which follow from them is not pure 
<A NAME="163"></A>scientific knowledge nor properly knowing at all, but rests on the mere 
<A NAME="164"></A>supposition that the premisses are true. The other party agree with them 
<A NAME="165"></A>as regards knowing, holding that it is only possible by demonstration, 
<A NAME="166"></A>but they see no difficulty in holding that all truths are demonstrated, 
<A NAME="167"></A>on the ground that demonstration may be circular and 
<A NAME="168"></A>reciprocal.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>Our own doctrine is that not all knowledge is demonstrative: on 
<A NAME="170"></A>the contrary, knowledge of the immediate premisses is independent of demonstration. 
<A NAME="171"></A>(The necessity of this is obvious; for since we must know the prior premisses 
<A NAME="172"></A>from which the demonstration is drawn, and since the regress must end in 
<A NAME="173"></A>immediate truths, those truths must be indemonstrable.) Such, then, is 
<A NAME="174"></A>our doctrine, and in addition we maintain that besides scientific knowledge 
<A NAME="175"></A>there is its originative source which enables us to recognize the 
<A NAME="176"></A>definitions.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>Now demonstration must be based on premisses prior to and better 
<A NAME="178"></A>known than the conclusion; and the same things cannot simultaneously be 
<A NAME="179"></A>both prior and posterior to one another: so circular demonstration is clearly 
<A NAME="180"></A>not possible in the unqualified sense of 'demonstration', but only possible 
<A NAME="181"></A>if 'demonstration' be extended to include that other method of argument 
<A NAME="182"></A>which rests on a distinction between truths prior to us and truths without 
<A NAME="183"></A>qualification prior, i.e. the method by which induction produces knowledge. 
<A NAME="184"></A>But if we accept this extension of its meaning, our definition of unqualified 
<A NAME="185"></A>knowledge will prove faulty; for there seem to be two kinds of it. Perhaps, 
<A NAME="186"></A>however, the second form of demonstration, that which proceeds from truths 
<A NAME="187"></A>better known to us, is not demonstration in the unqualified sense of the 
<A NAME="188"></A>term.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>The advocates of circular demonstration are not only faced with 
<A NAME="190"></A>the difficulty we have just stated: in addition their theory reduces to 
<A NAME="191"></A>the mere statement that if a thing exists, then it does exist-an easy way 
<A NAME="192"></A>of proving anything. That this is so can be clearly shown by taking three 
<A NAME="193"></A>terms, for to constitute the circle it makes no difference whether many 
<A NAME="194"></A>terms or few or even only two are taken. Thus by direct proof, if A is, 
<A NAME="195"></A>B must be; if B is, C must be; therefore if A is, C must be. Since then-by 
<A NAME="196"></A>the circular proof-if A is, B must be, and if B is, A must be, A may be 
<A NAME="197"></A>substituted for C above. Then 'if B is, A must be'='if B is, C must be', 
<A NAME="198"></A>which above gave the conclusion 'if A is, C must be': but C and A have 
<A NAME="199"></A>been identified. Consequently the upholders of circular demonstration are 
<A NAME="200"></A>in the position of saying that if A is, A must be-a simple way of proving 
<A NAME="201"></A>anything. Moreover, even such circular demonstration is impossible except 
<A NAME="202"></A>in the case of attributes that imply one another, viz. 'peculiar' 
<A NAME="203"></A>properties.
<A NAME="204"></A><BR><BR>Now, it has been shown that the positing of one thing-be it one 
<A NAME="205"></A>term or one premiss-never involves a necessary consequent: two premisses 
<A NAME="206"></A>constitute the first and smallest foundation for drawing a conclusion at 
<A NAME="207"></A>all and therefore a fortiori for the demonstrative syllogism of science. 
<A NAME="208"></A>If, then, A is implied in B and C, and B and C are reciprocally implied 
<A NAME="209"></A>in one another and in A, it is possible, as has been shown in my writings 
<A NAME="210"></A>on the syllogism, to prove all the assumptions on which the original conclusion 
<A NAME="211"></A>rested, by circular demonstration in the first figure. But it has also 
<A NAME="212"></A>been shown that in the other figures either no conclusion is possible, 
<A NAME="213"></A>or at least none which proves both the original premisses. Propositions 
<A NAME="214"></A>the terms of which are not convertible cannot be circularly demonstrated 
<A NAME="215"></A>at all, and since convertible terms occur rarely in actual demonstrations, 
<A NAME="216"></A>it is clearly frivolous and impossible to say that demonstration is reciprocal 
<A NAME="217"></A>and that therefore everything can be demonstrated.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="218"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>Since the object of pure scientific knowledge cannot be other than 
<A NAME="220"></A>it is, the truth obtained by demonstrative knowledge will be necessary. 
<A NAME="221"></A>And since demonstrative knowledge is only present when we have a demonstration, 
<A NAME="222"></A>it follows that demonstration is an inference from necessary premisses. 
<A NAME="223"></A>So we must consider what are the premisses of demonstration-i.e. what is 
<A NAME="224"></A>their character: and as a preliminary, let us define what we mean by an 
<A NAME="225"></A>attribute 'true in every instance of its subject', an 'essential' attribute, 
<A NAME="226"></A>and a 'commensurate and universal' attribute. I call 'true in every instance' 
<A NAME="227"></A>what is truly predicable of all instances-not of one to the exclusion of 
<A NAME="228"></A>others-and at all times, not at this or that time only; e.g. if animal 
<A NAME="229"></A>is truly predicable of every instance of man, then if it be true to say 
<A NAME="230"></A>'this is a man', 'this is an animal' is also true, and if the one be true 
<A NAME="231"></A>now the other is true now. A corresponding account holds if point is in 
<A NAME="232"></A>every instance predicable as contained in line. There is evidence for this 
<A NAME="233"></A>in the fact that the objection we raise against a proposition put to us 
<A NAME="234"></A>as true in every instance is either an instance in which, or an occasion 
<A NAME="235"></A>on which, it is not true. Essential attributes are (1) such as belong to 
<A NAME="236"></A>their subject as elements in its essential nature (e.g. line thus belongs 
<A NAME="237"></A>to triangle, point to line; for the very being or 'substance' of triangle 
<A NAME="238"></A>and line is composed of these elements, which are contained in the formulae 
<A NAME="239"></A>defining triangle and line): (2) such that, while they belong to certain 
<A NAME="240"></A>subjects, the subjects to which they belong are contained in the attribute's 
<A NAME="241"></A>own defining formula. Thus straight and curved belong to line, odd and 
<A NAME="242"></A>even, prime and compound, square and oblong, to number; and also the formula 
<A NAME="243"></A>defining any one of these attributes contains its subject-e.g. line or 
<A NAME="244"></A>number as the case may be.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>Extending this classification to all other attributes, I distinguish 
<A NAME="246"></A>those that answer the above description as belonging essentially to their 
<A NAME="247"></A>respective subjects; whereas attributes related in neither of these two 
<A NAME="248"></A>ways to their subjects I call accidents or 'coincidents'; e.g. musical 
<A NAME="249"></A>or white is a 'coincident' of animal.
<A NAME="250"></A><BR><BR>Further (a) that is essential which is not predicated of a subject 
<A NAME="251"></A>other than itself: e.g. 'the walking [thing]' walks and is white in virtue 
<A NAME="252"></A>of being something else besides; whereas substance, in the sense of whatever 
<A NAME="253"></A>signifies a 'this somewhat', is not what it is in virtue of being something 
<A NAME="254"></A>else besides. Things, then, not predicated of a subject I call essential; 
<A NAME="255"></A>things predicated of a subject I call accidental or 
<A NAME="256"></A>'coincidental'.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>In another sense again (b) a thing consequentially connected with 
<A NAME="258"></A>anything is essential; one not so connected is 'coincidental'. An example 
<A NAME="259"></A>of the latter is 'While he was walking it lightened': the lightning was 
<A NAME="260"></A>not due to his walking; it was, we should say, a coincidence. If, on the 
<A NAME="261"></A>other hand, there is a consequential connexion, the predication is essential; 
<A NAME="262"></A>e.g. if a beast dies when its throat is being cut, then its death is also 
<A NAME="263"></A>essentially connected with the cutting, because the cutting was the cause 
<A NAME="264"></A>of death, not death a 'coincident' of the cutting.
<A NAME="265"></A><BR><BR>So far then as concerns the sphere of connexions scientifically 
<A NAME="266"></A>known in the unqualified sense of that term, all attributes which (within 
<A NAME="267"></A>that sphere) are essential either in the sense that their subjects are 
<A NAME="268"></A>contained in them, or in the sense that they are contained in their subjects, 
<A NAME="269"></A>are necessary as well as consequentially connected with their subjects. 
<A NAME="270"></A>For it is impossible for them not to inhere in their subjects either simply 
<A NAME="271"></A>or in the qualified sense that one or other of a pair of opposites must 
<A NAME="272"></A>inhere in the subject; e.g. in line must be either straightness or curvature, 
<A NAME="273"></A>in number either oddness or evenness. For within a single identical genus 
<A NAME="274"></A>the contrary of a given attribute is either its privative or its contradictory; 
<A NAME="275"></A>e.g. within number what is not odd is even, inasmuch as within this sphere 
<A NAME="276"></A>even is a necessary consequent of not-odd. So, since any given predicate 
<A NAME="277"></A>must be either affirmed or denied of any subject, essential attributes 
<A NAME="278"></A>must inhere in their subjects of necessity.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>Thus, then, we have established the distinction between the attribute 
<A NAME="280"></A>which is 'true in every instance' and the 'essential' 
<A NAME="281"></A>attribute.
<A NAME="282"></A><BR><BR>I term 'commensurately universal' an attribute which belongs to 
<A NAME="283"></A>every instance of its subject, and to every instance essentially and as 
<A NAME="284"></A>such; from which it clearly follows that all commensurate universals inhere 
<A NAME="285"></A>necessarily in their subjects. The essential attribute, and the attribute 
<A NAME="286"></A>that belongs to its subject as such, are identical. E.g. point and straight 
<A NAME="287"></A>belong to line essentially, for they belong to line as such; and triangle 
<A NAME="288"></A>as such has two right angles, for it is essentially equal to two right 
<A NAME="289"></A>angles.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>An attribute belongs commensurately and universally to a subject 
<A NAME="291"></A>when it can be shown to belong to any random instance of that subject and 
<A NAME="292"></A>when the subject is the first thing to which it can be shown to belong. 
<A NAME="293"></A>Thus, e.g. (1) the equality of its angles to two right angles is not a 
<A NAME="294"></A>commensurately universal attribute of figure. For though it is possible 
<A NAME="295"></A>to show that a figure has its angles equal to two right angles, this attribute 
<A NAME="296"></A>cannot be demonstrated of any figure selected at haphazard, nor in demonstrating 
<A NAME="297"></A>does one take a figure at random-a square is a figure but its angles are 
<A NAME="298"></A>not equal to two right angles. On the other hand, any isosceles triangle 
<A NAME="299"></A>has its angles equal to two right angles, yet isosceles triangle is not 
<A NAME="300"></A>the primary subject of this attribute but triangle is prior. So whatever 
<A NAME="301"></A>can be shown to have its angles equal to two right angles, or to possess 
<A NAME="302"></A>any other attribute, in any random instance of itself and primarily-that 
<A NAME="303"></A>is the first subject to which the predicate in question belongs commensurately 
<A NAME="304"></A>and universally, and the demonstration, in the essential sense, of any 
<A NAME="305"></A>predicate is the proof of it as belonging to this first subject commensurately 
<A NAME="306"></A>and universally: while the proof of it as belonging to the other subjects 
<A NAME="307"></A>to which it attaches is demonstration only in a secondary and unessential 
<A NAME="308"></A>sense. Nor again (2) is equality to two right angles a commensurately universal 
<A NAME="309"></A>attribute of isosceles; it is of wider application.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="310"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>We must not fail to observe that we often fall into error because 
<A NAME="312"></A>our conclusion is not in fact primary and commensurately universal in the 
<A NAME="313"></A>sense in which we think we prove it so. We make this mistake (1) when the 
<A NAME="314"></A>subject is an individual or individuals above which there is no universal 
<A NAME="315"></A>to be found: (2) when the subjects belong to different species and there 
<A NAME="316"></A>is a higher universal, but it has no name: (3) when the subject which the 
<A NAME="317"></A>demonstrator takes as a whole is really only a part of a larger whole; 
<A NAME="318"></A>for then the demonstration will be true of the individual instances within 
<A NAME="319"></A>the part and will hold in every instance of it, yet the demonstration will 
<A NAME="320"></A>not be true of this subject primarily and commensurately and universally. 
<A NAME="321"></A>When a demonstration is true of a subject primarily and commensurately 
<A NAME="322"></A>and universally, that is to be taken to mean that it is true of a given 
<A NAME="323"></A>subject primarily and as such. Case (3) may be thus exemplified. If a proof 
<A NAME="324"></A>were given that perpendiculars to the same line are parallel, it might 
<A NAME="325"></A>be supposed that lines thus perpendicular were the proper subject of the 
<A NAME="326"></A>demonstration because being parallel is true of every instance of them. 
<A NAME="327"></A>But it is not so, for the parallelism depends not on these angles being 
<A NAME="328"></A>equal to one another because each is a right angle, but simply on their 
<A NAME="329"></A>being equal to one another. An example of (1) would be as follows: if isosceles 
<A NAME="330"></A>were the only triangle, it would be thought to have its angles equal to 
<A NAME="331"></A>two right angles qua isosceles. An instance of (2) would be the law that 
<A NAME="332"></A>proportionals alternate. Alternation used to be demonstrated separately 
<A NAME="333"></A>of numbers, lines, solids, and durations, though it could have been proved 
<A NAME="334"></A>of them all by a single demonstration. Because there was no single name 
<A NAME="335"></A>to denote that in which numbers, lengths, durations, and solids are identical, 
<A NAME="336"></A>and because they differed specifically from one another, this property 
<A NAME="337"></A>was proved of each of them separately. To-day, however, the proof is commensurately 
<A NAME="338"></A>universal, for they do not possess this attribute qua lines or qua numbers, 
<A NAME="339"></A>but qua manifesting this generic character which they are postulated as 
<A NAME="340"></A>possessing universally. Hence, even if one prove of each kind of triangle 
<A NAME="341"></A>that its angles are equal to two right angles, whether by means of the 
<A NAME="342"></A>same or different proofs; still, as long as one treats separately equilateral, 
<A NAME="343"></A>scalene, and isosceles, one does not yet know, except sophistically, that 
<A NAME="344"></A>triangle has its angles equal to two right angles, nor does one yet know 
<A NAME="345"></A>that triangle has this property commensurately and universally, even if 
<A NAME="346"></A>there is no other species of triangle but these. For one does not know 
<A NAME="347"></A>that triangle as such has this property, nor even that 'all' triangles 
<A NAME="348"></A>have it-unless 'all' means 'each taken singly': if 'all' means 'as a whole 
<A NAME="349"></A>class', then, though there be none in which one does not recognize this 
<A NAME="350"></A>property, one does not know it of 'all triangles'.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>When, then, does our knowledge fail of commensurate universality, 
<A NAME="352"></A>and when it is unqualified knowledge? If triangle be identical in essence 
<A NAME="353"></A>with equilateral, i.e. with each or all equilaterals, then clearly we have 
<A NAME="354"></A>unqualified knowledge: if on the other hand it be not, and the attribute 
<A NAME="355"></A>belongs to equilateral qua triangle; then our knowledge fails of commensurate 
<A NAME="356"></A>universality. 'But', it will be asked, 'does this attribute belong to the 
<A NAME="357"></A>subject of which it has been demonstrated qua triangle or qua isosceles? 
<A NAME="358"></A>What is the point at which the subject. to which it belongs is primary? 
<A NAME="359"></A>(i.e. to what subject can it be demonstrated as belonging commensurately 
<A NAME="360"></A>and universally?)' Clearly this point is the first term in which it is 
<A NAME="361"></A>found to inhere as the elimination of inferior differentiae proceeds. Thus 
<A NAME="362"></A>the angles of a brazen isosceles triangle are equal to two right angles: 
<A NAME="363"></A>but eliminate brazen and isosceles and the attribute remains. 'But'-you 
<A NAME="364"></A>may say-'eliminate figure or limit, and the attribute vanishes.' True, 
<A NAME="365"></A>but figure and limit are not the first differentiae whose elimination destroys 
<A NAME="366"></A>the attribute. 'Then what is the first?' If it is triangle, it will be 
<A NAME="367"></A>in virtue of triangle that the attribute belongs to all the other subjects 
<A NAME="368"></A>of which it is predicable, and triangle is the subject to which it can 
<A NAME="369"></A>be demonstrated as belonging commensurately and universally.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="370"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="371"></A><BR><BR>Demonstrative knowledge must rest on necessary basic truths; for 
<A NAME="372"></A>the object of scientific knowledge cannot be other than it is. Now attributes 
<A NAME="373"></A>attaching essentially to their subjects attach necessarily to them: for 
<A NAME="374"></A>essential attributes are either elements in the essential nature of their 
<A NAME="375"></A>subjects, or contain their subjects as elements in their own essential 
<A NAME="376"></A>nature. (The pairs of opposites which the latter class includes are necessary 
<A NAME="377"></A>because one member or the other necessarily inheres.) It follows from this 
<A NAME="378"></A>that premisses of the demonstrative syllogism must be connexions essential 
<A NAME="379"></A>in the sense explained: for all attributes must inhere essentially or else 
<A NAME="380"></A>be accidental, and accidental attributes are not necessary to their 
<A NAME="381"></A>subjects.
<A NAME="382"></A><BR><BR>We must either state the case thus, or else premise that the conclusion 
<A NAME="383"></A>of demonstration is necessary and that a demonstrated conclusion cannot 
<A NAME="384"></A>be other than it is, and then infer that the conclusion must be developed 
<A NAME="385"></A>from necessary premisses. For though you may reason from true premisses 
<A NAME="386"></A>without demonstrating, yet if your premisses are necessary you will assuredly 
<A NAME="387"></A>demonstrate-in such necessity you have at once a distinctive character 
<A NAME="388"></A>of demonstration. That demonstration proceeds from necessary premisses 
<A NAME="389"></A>is also indicated by the fact that the objection we raise against a professed 
<A NAME="390"></A>demonstration is that a premiss of it is not a necessary truth-whether 
<A NAME="391"></A>we think it altogether devoid of necessity, or at any rate so far as our 
<A NAME="392"></A>opponent's previous argument goes. This shows how naive it is to suppose 
<A NAME="393"></A>one's basic truths rightly chosen if one starts with a proposition which 
<A NAME="394"></A>is (1) popularly accepted and (2) true, such as the sophists' assumption 
<A NAME="395"></A>that to know is the same as to possess knowledge. For (1) popular acceptance 
<A NAME="396"></A>or rejection is no criterion of a basic truth, which can only be the primary 
<A NAME="397"></A>law of the genus constituting the subject matter of the demonstration; 
<A NAME="398"></A>and (2) not all truth is 'appropriate'.
<A NAME="399"></A><BR><BR>A further proof that the conclusion must be the development of 
<A NAME="400"></A>necessary premisses is as follows. Where demonstration is possible, one 
<A NAME="401"></A>who can give no account which includes the cause has no scientific knowledge. 
<A NAME="402"></A>If, then, we suppose a syllogism in which, though A necessarily inheres 
<A NAME="403"></A>in C, yet B, the middle term of the demonstration, is not necessarily connected 
<A NAME="404"></A>with A and C, then the man who argues thus has no reasoned knowledge of 
<A NAME="405"></A>the conclusion, since this conclusion does not owe its necessity to the 
<A NAME="406"></A>middle term; for though the conclusion is necessary, the mediating link 
<A NAME="407"></A>is a contingent fact. Or again, if a man is without knowledge now, though 
<A NAME="408"></A>he still retains the steps of the argument, though there is no change in 
<A NAME="409"></A>himself or in the fact and no lapse of memory on his part; then neither 
<A NAME="410"></A>had he knowledge previously. But the mediating link, not being necessary, 
<A NAME="411"></A>may have perished in the interval; and if so, though there be no change 
<A NAME="412"></A>in him nor in the fact, and though he will still retain the steps of the 
<A NAME="413"></A>argument, yet he has not knowledge, and therefore had not knowledge before. 
<A NAME="414"></A>Even if the link has not actually perished but is liable to perish, this 
<A NAME="415"></A>situation is possible and might occur. But such a condition cannot be 
<A NAME="416"></A>knowledge.
<A NAME="417"></A><BR><BR>When the conclusion is necessary, the middle through which it was 
<A NAME="418"></A>proved may yet quite easily be non-necessary. You can in fact infer the 
<A NAME="419"></A>necessary even from a non-necessary premiss, just as you can infer the 
<A NAME="420"></A>true from the not true. On the other hand, when the middle is necessary 
<A NAME="421"></A>the conclusion must be necessary; just as true premisses always give a 
<A NAME="422"></A>true conclusion. Thus, if A is necessarily predicated of B and B of C, 
<A NAME="423"></A>then A is necessarily predicated of C. But when the conclusion is nonnecessary 
<A NAME="424"></A>the middle cannot be necessary either. Thus: let A be predicated non-necessarily 
<A NAME="425"></A>of C but necessarily of B, and let B be a necessary predicate of C; then 
<A NAME="426"></A>A too will be a necessary predicate of C, which by hypothesis it is 
<A NAME="427"></A>not.
<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>To sum up, then: demonstrative knowledge must be knowledge of a 
<A NAME="429"></A>necessary nexus, and therefore must clearly be obtained through a necessary 
<A NAME="430"></A>middle term; otherwise its possessor will know neither the cause nor the 
<A NAME="431"></A>fact that his conclusion is a necessary connexion. Either he will mistake 
<A NAME="432"></A>the non-necessary for the necessary and believe the necessity of the conclusion 
<A NAME="433"></A>without knowing it, or else he will not even believe it-in which case he 
<A NAME="434"></A>will be equally ignorant, whether he actually infers the mere fact through 
<A NAME="435"></A>middle terms or the reasoned fact and from immediate 
<A NAME="436"></A>premisses.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>Of accidents that are not essential according to our definition 
<A NAME="438"></A>of essential there is no demonstrative knowledge; for since an accident, 
<A NAME="439"></A>in the sense in which I here speak of it, may also not inhere, it is impossible 
<A NAME="440"></A>to prove its inherence as a necessary conclusion. A difficulty, however, 
<A NAME="441"></A>might be raised as to why in dialectic, if the conclusion is not a necessary 
<A NAME="442"></A>connexion, such and such determinate premisses should be proposed in order 
<A NAME="443"></A>to deal with such and such determinate problems. Would not the result be 
<A NAME="444"></A>the same if one asked any questions whatever and then merely stated one's 
<A NAME="445"></A>conclusion? The solution is that determinate questions have to be put, 
<A NAME="446"></A>not because the replies to them affirm facts which necessitate facts affirmed 
<A NAME="447"></A>by the conclusion, but because these answers are propositions which if 
<A NAME="448"></A>the answerer affirm, he must affirm the conclusion and affirm it with truth 
<A NAME="449"></A>if they are true.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>Since it is just those attributes within every genus which are 
<A NAME="451"></A>essential and possessed by their respective subjects as such that are necessary 
<A NAME="452"></A>it is clear that both the conclusions and the premisses of demonstrations 
<A NAME="453"></A>which produce scientific knowledge are essential. For accidents are not 
<A NAME="454"></A>necessary: and, further, since accidents are not necessary one does not 
<A NAME="455"></A>necessarily have reasoned knowledge of a conclusion drawn from them (this 
<A NAME="456"></A>is so even if the accidental premisses are invariable but not essential, 
<A NAME="457"></A>as in proofs through signs; for though the conclusion be actually essential, 
<A NAME="458"></A>one will not know it as essential nor know its reason); but to have reasoned 
<A NAME="459"></A>knowledge of a conclusion is to know it through its cause. We may conclude 
<A NAME="460"></A>that the middle must be consequentially connected with the minor, and the 
<A NAME="461"></A>major with the middle.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="462"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="463"></A><BR><BR>It follows that we cannot in demonstrating pass from one genus 
<A NAME="464"></A>to another. We cannot, for instance, prove geometrical truths by arithmetic. 
<A NAME="465"></A>For there are three elements in demonstration: (1) what is proved, the 
<A NAME="466"></A>conclusion-an attribute inhering essentially in a genus; (2) the axioms, 
<A NAME="467"></A>i.e. axioms which are premisses of demonstration; (3) the subject-genus 
<A NAME="468"></A>whose attributes, i.e. essential properties, are revealed by the demonstration. 
<A NAME="469"></A>The axioms which are premisses of demonstration may be identical in two 
<A NAME="470"></A>or more sciences: but in the case of two different genera such as arithmetic 
<A NAME="471"></A>and geometry you cannot apply arithmetical demonstration to the properties 
<A NAME="472"></A>of magnitudes unless the magnitudes in question are numbers. How in certain 
<A NAME="473"></A>cases transference is possible I will explain later.
<A NAME="474"></A><BR><BR>Arithmetical demonstration and the other sciences likewise possess, 
<A NAME="475"></A>each of them, their own genera; so that if the demonstration is to pass 
<A NAME="476"></A>from one sphere to another, the genus must be either absolutely or to some 
<A NAME="477"></A>extent the same. If this is not so, transference is clearly impossible, 
<A NAME="478"></A>because the extreme and the middle terms must be drawn from the same genus: 
<A NAME="479"></A>otherwise, as predicated, they will not be essential and will thus be accidents. 
<A NAME="480"></A>That is why it cannot be proved by geometry that opposites fall under one 
<A NAME="481"></A>science, nor even that the product of two cubes is a cube. Nor can the 
<A NAME="482"></A>theorem of any one science be demonstrated by means of another science, 
<A NAME="483"></A>unless these theorems are related as subordinate to superior (e.g. as optical 
<A NAME="484"></A>theorems to geometry or harmonic theorems to arithmetic). Geometry again 
<A NAME="485"></A>cannot prove of lines any property which they do not possess qua lines, 
<A NAME="486"></A>i.e. in virtue of the fundamental truths of their peculiar genus: it cannot 
<A NAME="487"></A>show, for example, that the straight line is the most beautiful of lines 
<A NAME="488"></A>or the contrary of the circle; for these qualities do not belong to lines 
<A NAME="489"></A>in virtue of their peculiar genus, but through some property which it shares 
<A NAME="490"></A>with other genera.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="491"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="492"></A><BR><BR>It is also clear that if the premisses from which the syllogism 
<A NAME="493"></A>proceeds are commensurately universal, the conclusion of such i.e. in the 
<A NAME="494"></A>unqualified sense-must also be eternal. Therefore no attribute can be demonstrated 
<A NAME="495"></A>nor known by strictly scientific knowledge to inhere in perishable things. 
<A NAME="496"></A>The proof can only be accidental, because the attribute's connexion with 
<A NAME="497"></A>its perishable subject is not commensurately universal but temporary and 
<A NAME="498"></A>special. If such a demonstration is made, one premiss must be perishable 
<A NAME="499"></A>and not commensurately universal (perishable because only if it is perishable 
<A NAME="500"></A>will the conclusion be perishable; not commensurately universal, because 
<A NAME="501"></A>the predicate will be predicable of some instances of the subject and not 
<A NAME="502"></A>of others); so that the conclusion can only be that a fact is true at the 
<A NAME="503"></A>moment-not commensurately and universally. The same is true of definitions, 
<A NAME="504"></A>since a definition is either a primary premiss or a conclusion of a demonstration, 
<A NAME="505"></A>or else only differs from a demonstration in the order of its terms. Demonstration 
<A NAME="506"></A>and science of merely frequent occurrences-e.g. of eclipse as happening 
<A NAME="507"></A>to the moon-are, as such, clearly eternal: whereas so far as they are not 
<A NAME="508"></A>eternal they are not fully commensurate. Other subjects too have properties 
<A NAME="509"></A>attaching to them in the same way as eclipse attaches to the 
<A NAME="510"></A>moon.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="511"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="512"></A><BR><BR>It is clear that if the conclusion is to show an attribute inhering 
<A NAME="513"></A>as such, nothing can be demonstrated except from its 'appropriate' basic 
<A NAME="514"></A>truths. Consequently a proof even from true, indemonstrable, and immediate 
<A NAME="515"></A>premisses does not constitute knowledge. Such proofs are like Bryson's 
<A NAME="516"></A>method of squaring the circle; for they operate by taking as their middle 
<A NAME="517"></A>a common character-a character, therefore, which the subject may share 
<A NAME="518"></A>with another-and consequently they apply equally to subjects different 
<A NAME="519"></A>in kind. They therefore afford knowledge of an attribute only as inhering 
<A NAME="520"></A>accidentally, not as belonging to its subject as such: otherwise they would 
<A NAME="521"></A>not have been applicable to another genus.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>Our knowledge of any attribute's connexion with a subject is accidental 
<A NAME="523"></A>unless we know that connexion through the middle term in virtue of which 
<A NAME="524"></A>it inheres, and as an inference from basic premisses essential and 'appropriate' 
<A NAME="525"></A>to the subject-unless we know, e.g. the property of possessing angles equal 
<A NAME="526"></A>to two right angles as belonging to that subject in which it inheres essentially, 
<A NAME="527"></A>and as inferred from basic premisses essential and 'appropriate' to that 
<A NAME="528"></A>subject: so that if that middle term also belongs essentially to the minor, 
<A NAME="529"></A>the middle must belong to the same kind as the major and minor terms. The 
<A NAME="530"></A>only exceptions to this rule are such cases as theorems in harmonics which 
<A NAME="531"></A>are demonstrable by arithmetic. Such theorems are proved by the same middle 
<A NAME="532"></A>terms as arithmetical properties, but with a qualification-the fact falls 
<A NAME="533"></A>under a separate science (for the subject genus is separate), but the reasoned 
<A NAME="534"></A>fact concerns the superior science, to which the attributes essentially 
<A NAME="535"></A>belong. Thus, even these apparent exceptions show that no attribute is 
<A NAME="536"></A>strictly demonstrable except from its 'appropriate' basic truths, which, 
<A NAME="537"></A>however, in the case of these sciences have the requisite identity of 
<A NAME="538"></A>character.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>It is no less evident that the peculiar basic truths of each inhering 
<A NAME="540"></A>attribute are indemonstrable; for basic truths from which they might be 
<A NAME="541"></A>deduced would be basic truths of all that is, and the science to which 
<A NAME="542"></A>they belonged would possess universal sovereignty. This is so because he 
<A NAME="543"></A>knows better whose knowledge is deduced from higher causes, for his knowledge 
<A NAME="544"></A>is from prior premisses when it derives from causes themselves uncaused: 
<A NAME="545"></A>hence, if he knows better than others or best of all, his knowledge would 
<A NAME="546"></A>be science in a higher or the highest degree. But, as things are, demonstration 
<A NAME="547"></A>is not transferable to another genus, with such exceptions as we have mentioned 
<A NAME="548"></A>of the application of geometrical demonstrations to theorems in mechanics 
<A NAME="549"></A>or optics, or of arithmetical demonstrations to those of 
<A NAME="550"></A>harmonics.
<A NAME="551"></A><BR><BR>It is hard to be sure whether one knows or not; for it is hard 
<A NAME="552"></A>to be sure whether one's knowledge is based on the basic truths appropriate 
<A NAME="553"></A>to each attribute-the differentia of true knowledge. We think we have scientific 
<A NAME="554"></A>knowledge if we have reasoned from true and primary premisses. But that 
<A NAME="555"></A>is not so: the conclusion must be homogeneous with the basic facts of the 
<A NAME="556"></A>science.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="557"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>I call the basic truths of every genus those clements in it the 
<A NAME="559"></A>existence of which cannot be proved. As regards both these primary truths 
<A NAME="560"></A>and the attributes dependent on them the meaning of the name is assumed. 
<A NAME="561"></A>The fact of their existence as regards the primary truths must be assumed; 
<A NAME="562"></A>but it has to be proved of the remainder, the attributes. Thus we assume 
<A NAME="563"></A>the meaning alike of unity, straight, and triangular; but while as regards 
<A NAME="564"></A>unity and magnitude we assume also the fact of their existence, in the 
<A NAME="565"></A>case of the remainder proof is required.
<A NAME="566"></A><BR><BR>Of the basic truths used in the demonstrative sciences some are 
<A NAME="567"></A>peculiar to each science, and some are common, but common only in the sense 
<A NAME="568"></A>of analogous, being of use only in so far as they fall within the genus 
<A NAME="569"></A>constituting the province of the science in question.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR>Peculiar truths are, e.g. the definitions of line and straight; 
<A NAME="571"></A>common truths are such as 'take equals from equals and equals remain'. 
<A NAME="572"></A>Only so much of these common truths is required as falls within the genus 
<A NAME="573"></A>in question: for a truth of this kind will have the same force even if 
<A NAME="574"></A>not used generally but applied by the geometer only to magnitudes, or by 
<A NAME="575"></A>the arithmetician only to numbers. Also peculiar to a science are the subjects 
<A NAME="576"></A>the existence as well as the meaning of which it assumes, and the essential 
<A NAME="577"></A>attributes of which it investigates, e.g. in arithmetic units, in geometry 
<A NAME="578"></A>points and lines. Both the existence and the meaning of the subjects are 
<A NAME="579"></A>assumed by these sciences; but of their essential attributes only the meaning 
<A NAME="580"></A>is assumed. For example arithmetic assumes the meaning of odd and even, 
<A NAME="581"></A>square and cube, geometry that of incommensurable, or of deflection or 
<A NAME="582"></A>verging of lines, whereas the existence of these attributes is demonstrated 
<A NAME="583"></A>by means of the axioms and from previous conclusions as premisses. Astronomy 
<A NAME="584"></A>too proceeds in the same way. For indeed every demonstrative science has 
<A NAME="585"></A>three elements: (1) that which it posits, the subject genus whose essential 
<A NAME="586"></A>attributes it examines; (2) the so-called axioms, which are primary premisses 
<A NAME="587"></A>of its demonstration; (3) the attributes, the meaning of which it assumes. 
<A NAME="588"></A>Yet some sciences may very well pass over some of these elements; e.g. 
<A NAME="589"></A>we might not expressly posit the existence of the genus if its existence 
<A NAME="590"></A>were obvious (for instance, the existence of hot and cold is more evident 
<A NAME="591"></A>than that of number); or we might omit to assume expressly the meaning 
<A NAME="592"></A>of the attributes if it were well understood. In the way the meaning of 
<A NAME="593"></A>axioms, such as 'Take equals from equals and equals remain', is well known 
<A NAME="594"></A>and so not expressly assumed. Nevertheless in the nature of the case the 
<A NAME="595"></A>essential elements of demonstration are three: the subject, the attributes, 
<A NAME="596"></A>and the basic premisses.
<A NAME="597"></A><BR><BR>That which expresses necessary self-grounded fact, and which we 
<A NAME="598"></A>must necessarily believe, is distinct both from the hypotheses of a science 
<A NAME="599"></A>and from illegitimate postulate-I say 'must believe', because all syllogism, 
<A NAME="600"></A>and therefore a fortiori demonstration, is addressed not to the spoken 
<A NAME="601"></A>word, but to the discourse within the soul, and though we can always raise 
<A NAME="602"></A>objections to the spoken word, to the inward discourse we cannot always 
<A NAME="603"></A>object. That which is capable of proof but assumed by the teacher without 
<A NAME="604"></A>proof is, if the pupil believes and accepts it, hypothesis, though only 
<A NAME="605"></A>in a limited sense hypothesis-that is, relatively to the pupil; if the 
<A NAME="606"></A>pupil has no opinion or a contrary opinion on the matter, the same assumption 
<A NAME="607"></A>is an illegitimate postulate. Therein lies the distinction between hypothesis 
<A NAME="608"></A>and illegitimate postulate: the latter is the contrary of the pupil's opinion, 
<A NAME="609"></A>demonstrable, but assumed and used without demonstration.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>The definition-viz. those which are not expressed as statements 
<A NAME="611"></A>that anything is or is not-are not hypotheses: but it is in the premisses 
<A NAME="612"></A>of a science that its hypotheses are contained. Definitions require only 
<A NAME="613"></A>to be understood, and this is not hypothesis-unless it be contended that 
<A NAME="614"></A>the pupil's hearing is also an hypothesis required by the teacher. Hypotheses, 
<A NAME="615"></A>on the contrary, postulate facts on the being of which depends the being 
<A NAME="616"></A>of the fact inferred. Nor are the geometer's hypotheses false, as some 
<A NAME="617"></A>have held, urging that one must not employ falsehood and that the geometer 
<A NAME="618"></A>is uttering falsehood in stating that the line which he draws is a foot 
<A NAME="619"></A>long or straight, when it is actually neither. The truth is that the geometer 
<A NAME="620"></A>does not draw any conclusion from the being of the particular line of which 
<A NAME="621"></A>he speaks, but from what his diagrams symbolize. A further distinction 
<A NAME="622"></A>is that all hypotheses and illegitimate postulates are either universal 
<A NAME="623"></A>or particular, whereas a definition is neither.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="624"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="625"></A><BR><BR>So demonstration does not necessarily imply the being of Forms 
<A NAME="626"></A>nor a One beside a Many, but it does necessarily imply the possibility 
<A NAME="627"></A>of truly predicating one of many; since without this possibility we cannot 
<A NAME="628"></A>save the universal, and if the universal goes, the middle term goes witb. 
<A NAME="629"></A>it, and so demonstration becomes impossible. We conclude, then, that there 
<A NAME="630"></A>must be a single identical term unequivocally predicable of a number of 
<A NAME="631"></A>individuals.
<A NAME="632"></A><BR><BR>The law that it is impossible to affirm and deny simultaneously 
<A NAME="633"></A>the same predicate of the same subject is not expressly posited by any 
<A NAME="634"></A>demonstration except when the conclusion also has to be expressed in that 
<A NAME="635"></A>form; in which case the proof lays down as its major premiss that the major 
<A NAME="636"></A>is truly affirmed of the middle but falsely denied. It makes no difference, 
<A NAME="637"></A>however, if we add to the middle, or again to the minor term, the corresponding 
<A NAME="638"></A>negative. For grant a minor term of which it is true to predicate man-even 
<A NAME="639"></A>if it be also true to predicate not-man of it--still grant simply that 
<A NAME="640"></A>man is animal and not not-animal, and the conclusion follows: for it will 
<A NAME="641"></A>still be true to say that Callias--even if it be also true to say that 
<A NAME="642"></A>not-Callias--is animal and not not-animal. The reason is that the major 
<A NAME="643"></A>term is predicable not only of the middle, but of something other than 
<A NAME="644"></A>the middle as well, being of wider application; so that the conclusion 
<A NAME="645"></A>is not affected even if the middle is extended to cover the original middle 
<A NAME="646"></A>term and also what is not the original middle term.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR>The law that every predicate can be either truly affirmed or truly 
<A NAME="648"></A>denied of every subject is posited by such demonstration as uses reductio 
<A NAME="649"></A>ad impossibile, and then not always universally, but so far as it is requisite; 
<A NAME="650"></A>within the limits, that is, of the genus-the genus, I mean (as I have already 
<A NAME="651"></A>explained), to which the man of science applies his demonstrations. In 
<A NAME="652"></A>virtue of the common elements of demonstration-I mean the common axioms 
<A NAME="653"></A>which are used as premisses of demonstration, not the subjects nor the 
<A NAME="654"></A>attributes demonstrated as belonging to them-all the sciences have communion 
<A NAME="655"></A>with one another, and in communion with them all is dialectic and any science 
<A NAME="656"></A>which might attempt a universal proof of axioms such as the law of excluded 
<A NAME="657"></A>middle, the law that the subtraction of equals from equals leaves equal 
<A NAME="658"></A>remainders, or other axioms of the same kind. Dialectic has no definite 
<A NAME="659"></A>sphere of this kind, not being confined to a single genus. Otherwise its 
<A NAME="660"></A>method would not be interrogative; for the interrogative method is barred 
<A NAME="661"></A>to the demonstrator, who cannot use the opposite facts to prove the same 
<A NAME="662"></A>nexus. This was shown in my work on the syllogism.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="663"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="664"></A><BR><BR>If a syllogistic question is equivalent to a proposition embodying 
<A NAME="665"></A>one of the two sides of a contradiction, and if each science has its peculiar 
<A NAME="666"></A>propositions from which its peculiar conclusion is developed, then there 
<A NAME="667"></A>is such a thing as a distinctively scientific question, and it is the interrogative 
<A NAME="668"></A>form of the premisses from which the 'appropriate' conclusion of each science 
<A NAME="669"></A>is developed. Hence it is clear that not every question will be relevant 
<A NAME="670"></A>to geometry, nor to medicine, nor to any other science: only those questions 
<A NAME="671"></A>will be geometrical which form premisses for the proof of the theorems 
<A NAME="672"></A>of geometry or of any other science, such as optics, which uses the same 
<A NAME="673"></A>basic truths as geometry. Of the other sciences the like is true. Of these 
<A NAME="674"></A>questions the geometer is bound to give his account, using the basic truths 
<A NAME="675"></A>of geometry in conjunction with his previous conclusions; of the basic 
<A NAME="676"></A>truths the geometer, as such, is not bound to give any account. The like 
<A NAME="677"></A>is true of the other sciences. There is a limit, then, to the questions 
<A NAME="678"></A>which we may put to each man of science; nor is each man of science bound 
<A NAME="679"></A>to answer all inquiries on each several subject, but only such as fall 
<A NAME="680"></A>within the defined field of his own science. If, then, in controversy with 
<A NAME="681"></A>a geometer qua geometer the disputant confines himself to geometry and 
<A NAME="682"></A>proves anything from geometrical premisses, he is clearly to be applauded; 
<A NAME="683"></A>if he goes outside these he will be at fault, and obviously cannot even 
<A NAME="684"></A>refute the geometer except accidentally. One should therefore not discuss 
<A NAME="685"></A>geometry among those who are not geometers, for in such a company an unsound 
<A NAME="686"></A>argument will pass unnoticed. This is correspondingly true in the other 
<A NAME="687"></A>sciences.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>Since there are 'geometrical' questions, does it follow that there 
<A NAME="689"></A>are also distinctively 'ungeometrical' questions? Further, in each special 
<A NAME="690"></A>science-geometry for instance-what kind of error is it that may vitiate 
<A NAME="691"></A>questions, and yet not exclude them from that science? Again, is the erroneous 
<A NAME="692"></A>conclusion one constructed from premisses opposite to the true premisses, 
<A NAME="693"></A>or is it formal fallacy though drawn from geometrical premisses? Or, perhaps, 
<A NAME="694"></A>the erroneous conclusion is due to the drawing of premisses from another 
<A NAME="695"></A>science; e.g. in a geometrical controversy a musical question is distinctively 
<A NAME="696"></A>ungeometrical, whereas the notion that parallels meet is in one sense geometrical, 
<A NAME="697"></A>being ungeometrical in a different fashion: the reason being that 'ungeometrical', 
<A NAME="698"></A>like 'unrhythmical', is equivocal, meaning in the one case not geometry 
<A NAME="699"></A>at all, in the other bad geometry? It is this error, i.e. error based on 
<A NAME="700"></A>premisses of this kind-'of' the science but false-that is the contrary 
<A NAME="701"></A>of science. In mathematics the formal fallacy is not so common, because 
<A NAME="702"></A>it is the middle term in which the ambiguity lies, since the major is predicated 
<A NAME="703"></A>of the whole of the middle and the middle of the whole of the minor (the 
<A NAME="704"></A>predicate of course never has the prefix 'all'); and in mathematics one 
<A NAME="705"></A>can, so to speak, see these middle terms with an intellectual vision, while 
<A NAME="706"></A>in dialectic the ambiguity may escape detection. E.g. 'Is every circle 
<A NAME="707"></A>a figure?' A diagram shows that this is so, but the minor premiss 'Are 
<A NAME="708"></A>epics circles?' is shown by the diagram to be false.
<A NAME="709"></A><BR><BR>If a proof has an inductive minor premiss, one should not bring 
<A NAME="710"></A>an 'objection' against it. For since every premiss must be applicable to 
<A NAME="711"></A>a number of cases (otherwise it will not be true in every instance, which, 
<A NAME="712"></A>since the syllogism proceeds from universals, it must be), then assuredly 
<A NAME="713"></A>the same is true of an 'objection'; since premisses and 'objections' are 
<A NAME="714"></A>so far the same that anything which can be validly advanced as an 'objection' 
<A NAME="715"></A>must be such that it could take the form of a premiss, either demonstrative 
<A NAME="716"></A>or dialectical. On the other hand, arguments formally illogical do sometimes 
<A NAME="717"></A>occur through taking as middles mere attributes of the major and minor 
<A NAME="718"></A>terms. An instance of this is Caeneus' proof that fire increases in geometrical 
<A NAME="719"></A>proportion: 'Fire', he argues, 'increases rapidly, and so does geometrical 
<A NAME="720"></A>proportion'. There is no syllogism so, but there is a syllogism if the 
<A NAME="721"></A>most rapidly increasing proportion is geometrical and the most rapidly 
<A NAME="722"></A>increasing proportion is attributable to fire in its motion. Sometimes, 
<A NAME="723"></A>no doubt, it is impossible to reason from premisses predicating mere attributes: 
<A NAME="724"></A>but sometimes it is possible, though the possibility is overlooked. If 
<A NAME="725"></A>false premisses could never give true conclusions 'resolution' would be 
<A NAME="726"></A>easy, for premisses and conclusion would in that case inevitably reciprocate. 
<A NAME="727"></A>I might then argue thus: let A be an existing fact; let the existence of 
<A NAME="728"></A>A imply such and such facts actually known to me to exist, which we may 
<A NAME="729"></A>call B. I can now, since they reciprocate, infer A from 
<A NAME="730"></A>B.
<A NAME="731"></A><BR><BR>Reciprocation of premisses and conclusion is more frequent in mathematics, 
<A NAME="732"></A>because mathematics takes definitions, but never an accident, for its premisses-a 
<A NAME="733"></A>second characteristic distinguishing mathematical reasoning from dialectical 
<A NAME="734"></A>disputations.
<A NAME="735"></A><BR><BR>A science expands not by the interposition of fresh middle terms, 
<A NAME="736"></A>but by the apposition of fresh extreme terms. E.g. A is predicated of B, 
<A NAME="737"></A>B of C, C of D, and so indefinitely. Or the expansion may be lateral: e.g. 
<A NAME="738"></A>one major A, may be proved of two minors, C and E. Thus let A represent 
<A NAME="739"></A>number-a number or number taken indeterminately; B determinate odd number; 
<A NAME="740"></A>C any particular odd number. We can then predicate A of C. Next let D represent 
<A NAME="741"></A>determinate even number, and E even number. Then A is predicable of 
<A NAME="742"></A>E.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="743"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR>Knowledge of the fact differs from knowledge of the reasoned fact. 
<A NAME="745"></A>To begin with, they differ within the same science and in two ways: (1) 
<A NAME="746"></A>when the premisses of the syllogism are not immediate (for then the proximate 
<A NAME="747"></A>cause is not contained in them-a necessary condition of knowledge of the 
<A NAME="748"></A>reasoned fact): (2) when the premisses are immediate, but instead of the 
<A NAME="749"></A>cause the better known of the two reciprocals is taken as the middle; for 
<A NAME="750"></A>of two reciprocally predicable terms the one which is not the cause may 
<A NAME="751"></A>quite easily be the better known and so become the middle term of the demonstration. 
<A NAME="752"></A>Thus (2) (a) you might prove as follows that the planets are near because 
<A NAME="753"></A>they do not twinkle: let C be the planets, B not twinkling, A proximity. 
<A NAME="754"></A>Then B is predicable of C; for the planets do not twinkle. But A is also 
<A NAME="755"></A>predicable of B, since that which does not twinkle is near--we must take 
<A NAME="756"></A>this truth as having been reached by induction or sense-perception. Therefore 
<A NAME="757"></A>A is a necessary predicate of C; so that we have demonstrated that the 
<A NAME="758"></A>planets are near. This syllogism, then, proves not the reasoned fact but 
<A NAME="759"></A>only the fact; since they are not near because they do not twinkle, but, 
<A NAME="760"></A>because they are near, do not twinkle. The major and middle of the proof, 
<A NAME="761"></A>however, may be reversed, and then the demonstration will be of the reasoned 
<A NAME="762"></A>fact. Thus: let C be the planets, B proximity, A not twinkling. Then B 
<A NAME="763"></A>is an attribute of C, and A-not twinkling-of B. Consequently A is predicable 
<A NAME="764"></A>of C, and the syllogism proves the reasoned fact, since its middle term 
<A NAME="765"></A>is the proximate cause. Another example is the inference that the moon 
<A NAME="766"></A>is spherical from its manner of waxing. Thus: since that which so waxes 
<A NAME="767"></A>is spherical, and since the moon so waxes, clearly the moon is spherical. 
<A NAME="768"></A>Put in this form, the syllogism turns out to be proof of the fact, but 
<A NAME="769"></A>if the middle and major be reversed it is proof of the reasoned fact; since 
<A NAME="770"></A>the moon is not spherical because it waxes in a certain manner, but waxes 
<A NAME="771"></A>in such a manner because it is spherical. (Let C be the moon, B spherical, 
<A NAME="772"></A>and A waxing.) Again (b), in cases where the cause and the effect are not 
<A NAME="773"></A>reciprocal and the effect is the better known, the fact is demonstrated 
<A NAME="774"></A>but not the reasoned fact. This also occurs (1) when the middle falls outside 
<A NAME="775"></A>the major and minor, for here too the strict cause is not given, and so 
<A NAME="776"></A>the demonstration is of the fact, not of the reasoned fact. For example, 
<A NAME="777"></A>the question 'Why does not a wall breathe?' might be answered, 'Because 
<A NAME="778"></A>it is not an animal'; but that answer would not give the strict cause, 
<A NAME="779"></A>because if not being an animal causes the absence of respiration, then 
<A NAME="780"></A>being an animal should be the cause of respiration, according to the rule 
<A NAME="781"></A>that if the negation of causes the non-inherence of y, the affirmation 
<A NAME="782"></A>of x causes the inherence of y; e.g. if the disproportion of the hot and 
<A NAME="783"></A>cold elements is the cause of ill health, their proportion is the cause 
<A NAME="784"></A>of health; and conversely, if the assertion of x causes the inherence of 
<A NAME="785"></A>y, the negation of x must cause y's non-inherence. But in the case given 
<A NAME="786"></A>this consequence does not result; for not every animal breathes. A syllogism 
<A NAME="787"></A>with this kind of cause takes place in the second figure. Thus: let A be 
<A NAME="788"></A>animal, B respiration, C wall. Then A is predicable of all B (for all that 
<A NAME="789"></A>breathes is animal), but of no C; and consequently B is predicable of no 
<A NAME="790"></A>C; that is, the wall does not breathe. Such causes are like far-fetched 
<A NAME="791"></A>explanations, which precisely consist in making the cause too remote, as 
<A NAME="792"></A>in Anacharsis' account of why the Scythians have no flute-players; namely 
<A NAME="793"></A>because they have no vines.
<A NAME="794"></A><BR><BR>Thus, then, do the syllogism of the fact and the syllogism of the 
<A NAME="795"></A>reasoned fact differ within one science and according to the position of 
<A NAME="796"></A>the middle terms. But there is another way too in which the fact and the 
<A NAME="797"></A>reasoned fact differ, and that is when they are investigated respectively 
<A NAME="798"></A>by different sciences. This occurs in the case of problems related to one 
<A NAME="799"></A>another as subordinate and superior, as when optical problems are subordinated 
<A NAME="800"></A>to geometry, mechanical problems to stereometry, harmonic problems to arithmetic, 
<A NAME="801"></A>the data of observation to astronomy. (Some of these sciences bear almost 
<A NAME="802"></A>the same name; e.g. mathematical and nautical astronomy, mathematical and 
<A NAME="803"></A>acoustical harmonics.) Here it is the business of the empirical observers 
<A NAME="804"></A>to know the fact, of the mathematicians to know the reasoned fact; for 
<A NAME="805"></A>the latter are in possession of the demonstrations giving the causes, and 
<A NAME="806"></A>are often ignorant of the fact: just as we have often a clear insight into 
<A NAME="807"></A>a universal, but through lack of observation are ignorant of some of its 
<A NAME="808"></A>particular instances. These connexions have a perceptible existence though 
<A NAME="809"></A>they are manifestations of forms. For the mathematical sciences concern 
<A NAME="810"></A>forms: they do not demonstrate properties of a substratum, since, even 
<A NAME="811"></A>though the geometrical subjects are predicable as properties of a perceptible 
<A NAME="812"></A>substratum, it is not as thus predicable that the mathematician demonstrates 
<A NAME="813"></A>properties of them. As optics is related to geometry, so another science 
<A NAME="814"></A>is related to optics, namely the theory of the rainbow. Here knowledge 
<A NAME="815"></A>of the fact is within the province of the natural philosopher, knowledge 
<A NAME="816"></A>of the reasoned fact within that of the optician, either qua optician or 
<A NAME="817"></A>qua mathematical optician. Many sciences not standing in this mutual relation 
<A NAME="818"></A>enter into it at points; e.g. medicine and geometry: it is the physician's 
<A NAME="819"></A>business to know that circular wounds heal more slowly, the geometer's 
<A NAME="820"></A>to know the reason why.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="821"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR>Of all the figures the most scientific is the first. Thus, it is 
<A NAME="823"></A>the vehicle of the demonstrations of all the mathematical sciences, such 
<A NAME="824"></A>as arithmetic, geometry, and optics, and practically all of all sciences 
<A NAME="825"></A>that investigate causes: for the syllogism of the reasoned fact is either 
<A NAME="826"></A>exclusively or generally speaking and in most cases in this figure-a second 
<A NAME="827"></A>proof that this figure is the most scientific; for grasp of a reasoned 
<A NAME="828"></A>conclusion is the primary condition of knowledge. Thirdly, the first is 
<A NAME="829"></A>the only figure which enables us to pursue knowledge of the essence of 
<A NAME="830"></A>a thing. In the second figure no affirmative conclusion is possible, and 
<A NAME="831"></A>knowledge of a thing's essence must be affirmative; while in the third 
<A NAME="832"></A>figure the conclusion can be affirmative, but cannot be universal, and 
<A NAME="833"></A>essence must have a universal character: e.g. man is not two-footed animal 
<A NAME="834"></A>in any qualified sense, but universally. Finally, the first figure has 
<A NAME="835"></A>no need of the others, while it is by means of the first that the other 
<A NAME="836"></A>two figures are developed, and have their intervals closepacked until immediate 
<A NAME="837"></A>premisses are reached.
<A NAME="838"></A><BR><BR>Clearly, therefore, the first figure is the primary condition of 
<A NAME="839"></A>knowledge.

<A NAME="840"></A><B>Part 15</B>

<A NAME="841"></A><BR><BR>Just as an attribute A may (as we saw) be atomically connected 
<A NAME="842"></A>with a subject B, so its disconnexion may be atomic. I call 'atomic' connexions 
<A NAME="843"></A>or disconnexions which involve no intermediate term; since in that case 
<A NAME="844"></A>the connexion or disconnexion will not be mediated by something other than 
<A NAME="845"></A>the terms themselves. It follows that if either A or B, or both A and B, 
<A NAME="846"></A>have a genus, their disconnexion cannot be primary. Thus: let C be the 
<A NAME="847"></A>genus of A. Then, if C is not the genus of B-for A may well have a genus 
<A NAME="848"></A>which is not the genus of B-there will be a syllogism proving A's disconnexion 
<A NAME="849"></A>from B thus:
<A NAME="850"></A><BR><BR><B>all A is C,</B> <B>no B is C,</B> <B>therefore no B is A.</B> 
<A NAME="851"></A>Or if it is B which has a genus D, we have
<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR><B>all B is D,</B> <B>no D is A,</B> <B>therefore no B is A, by 
<A NAME="853"></A>syllogism;</B> and the proof will be similar if both A and B have a genus. 
<A NAME="854"></A>That the genus of A need not be the genus of B and vice versa, is shown 
<A NAME="855"></A>by the existence of mutually exclusive coordinate series of predication. 
<A NAME="856"></A>If no term in the series ACD...is predicable of any term in the series 
<A NAME="857"></A>BEF...,and if G-a term in the former series-is the genus of A, clearly 
<A NAME="858"></A>G will not be the genus of B; since, if it were, the series would not be 
<A NAME="859"></A>mutually exclusive. So also if B has a genus, it will not be the genus 
<A NAME="860"></A>of A. If, on the other hand, neither A nor B has a genus and A does not 
<A NAME="861"></A>inhere in B, this disconnexion must be atomic. If there be a middle term, 
<A NAME="862"></A>one or other of them is bound to have a genus, for the syllogism will be 
<A NAME="863"></A>either in the first or the second figure. If it is in the first, B will 
<A NAME="864"></A>have a genus-for the premiss containing it must be affirmative: if in the 
<A NAME="865"></A>second, either A or B indifferently, since syllogism is possible if either 
<A NAME="866"></A>is contained in a negative premiss, but not if both premisses are 
<A NAME="867"></A>negative.
<A NAME="868"></A><BR><BR>Hence it is clear that one thing may be atomically disconnected 
<A NAME="869"></A>from another, and we have stated when and how this is 
<A NAME="870"></A>possible.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="871"></A><B>Part 16</B>

<A NAME="872"></A><BR><BR>Ignorance-defined not as the negation of knowledge but as a positive 
<A NAME="873"></A>state of mind-is error produced by inference.
<A NAME="874"></A><BR><BR>(1) Let us first consider propositions asserting a predicate's 
<A NAME="875"></A>immediate connexion with or disconnexion from a subject. Here, it is true, 
<A NAME="876"></A>positive error may befall one in alternative ways; for it may arise where 
<A NAME="877"></A>one directly believes a connexion or disconnexion as well as where one's 
<A NAME="878"></A>belief is acquired by inference. The error, however, that consists in a 
<A NAME="879"></A>direct belief is without complication; but the error resulting from inference-which 
<A NAME="880"></A>here concerns us-takes many forms. Thus, let A be atomically disconnected 
<A NAME="881"></A>from all B: then the conclusion inferred through a middle term C, that 
<A NAME="882"></A>all B is A, will be a case of error produced by syllogism. Now, two cases 
<A NAME="883"></A>are possible. Either (a) both premisses, or (b) one premiss only, may be 
<A NAME="884"></A>false. (a) If neither A is an attribute of any C nor C of any B, whereas 
<A NAME="885"></A>the contrary was posited in both cases, both premisses will be false. (C 
<A NAME="886"></A>may quite well be so related to A and B that C is neither subordinate to 
<A NAME="887"></A>A nor a universal attribute of B: for B, since A was said to be primarily 
<A NAME="888"></A>disconnected from B, cannot have a genus, and A need not necessarily be 
<A NAME="889"></A>a universal attribute of all things. Consequently both premisses may be 
<A NAME="890"></A>false.) On the other hand, (b) one of the premisses may be true, though 
<A NAME="891"></A>not either indifferently but only the major A-C since, B having no genus, 
<A NAME="892"></A>the premiss C-B will always be false, while A-C may be true. This is the 
<A NAME="893"></A>case if, for example, A is related atomically to both C and B; because 
<A NAME="894"></A>when the same term is related atomically to more terms than one, neither 
<A NAME="895"></A>of those terms will belong to the other. It is, of course, equally the 
<A NAME="896"></A>case if A-C is not atomic.
<A NAME="897"></A><BR><BR>Error of attribution, then, occurs through these causes and in 
<A NAME="898"></A>this form only-for we found that no syllogism of universal attribution 
<A NAME="899"></A>was possible in any figure but the first. On the other hand, an error of 
<A NAME="900"></A>non-attribution may occur either in the first or in the second figure. 
<A NAME="901"></A>Let us therefore first explain the various forms it takes in the first 
<A NAME="902"></A>figure and the character of the premisses in each case.
<A NAME="903"></A><BR><BR>(c) It may occur when both premisses are false; e.g. supposing 
<A NAME="904"></A>A atomically connected with both C and B, if it be then assumed that no 
<A NAME="905"></A>C is and all B is C, both premisses are false.
<A NAME="906"></A><BR><BR>(d) It is also possible when one is false. This may be either premiss 
<A NAME="907"></A>indifferently. A-C may be true, C-B false-A-C true because A is not an 
<A NAME="908"></A>attribute of all things, C-B false because C, which never has the attribute 
<A NAME="909"></A>A, cannot be an attribute of B; for if C-B were true, the premiss A-C would 
<A NAME="910"></A>no longer be true, and besides if both premisses were true, the conclusion 
<A NAME="911"></A>would be true. Or again, C-B may be true and A-C false; e.g. if both C 
<A NAME="912"></A>and A contain B as genera, one of them must be subordinate to the other, 
<A NAME="913"></A>so that if the premiss takes the form No C is A, it will be false. This 
<A NAME="914"></A>makes it clear that whether either or both premisses are false, the conclusion 
<A NAME="915"></A>will equally be false.
<A NAME="916"></A><BR><BR>In the second figure the premisses cannot both be wholly false; 
<A NAME="917"></A>for if all B is A, no middle term can be with truth universally affirmed 
<A NAME="918"></A>of one extreme and universally denied of the other: but premisses in which 
<A NAME="919"></A>the middle is affirmed of one extreme and denied of the other are the necessary 
<A NAME="920"></A>condition if one is to get a valid inference at all. Therefore if, taken 
<A NAME="921"></A>in this way, they are wholly false, their contraries conversely should 
<A NAME="922"></A>be wholly true. But this is impossible. On the other hand, there is nothing 
<A NAME="923"></A>to prevent both premisses being partially false; e.g. if actually some 
<A NAME="924"></A>A is C and some B is C, then if it is premised that all A is C and no B 
<A NAME="925"></A>is C, both premisses are false, yet partially, not wholly, false. The same 
<A NAME="926"></A>is true if the major is made negative instead of the minor. Or one premiss 
<A NAME="927"></A>may be wholly false, and it may be either of them. Thus, supposing that 
<A NAME="928"></A>actually an attribute of all A must also be an attribute of all B, then 
<A NAME="929"></A>if C is yet taken to be a universal attribute of all but universally non-attributable 
<A NAME="930"></A>to B, C-A will be true but C-B false. Again, actually that which is an 
<A NAME="931"></A>attribute of no B will not be an attribute of all A either; for if it be 
<A NAME="932"></A>an attribute of all A, it will also be an attribute of all B, which is 
<A NAME="933"></A>contrary to supposition; but if C be nevertheless assumed to be a universal 
<A NAME="934"></A>attribute of A, but an attribute of no B, then the premiss C-B is true 
<A NAME="935"></A>but the major is false. The case is similar if the major is made the negative 
<A NAME="936"></A>premiss. For in fact what is an attribute of no A will not be an attribute 
<A NAME="937"></A>of any B either; and if it be yet assumed that C is universally non-attributable 
<A NAME="938"></A>to A, but a universal attribute of B, the premiss C-A is true but the minor 
<A NAME="939"></A>wholly false. Again, in fact it is false to assume that that which is an 
<A NAME="940"></A>attribute of all B is an attribute of no A, for if it be an attribute of 
<A NAME="941"></A>all B, it must be an attribute of some A. If then C is nevertheless assumed 
<A NAME="942"></A>to be an attribute of all B but of no A, C-B will be true but C-A 
<A NAME="943"></A>false.
<A NAME="944"></A><BR><BR>It is thus clear that in the case of atomic propositions erroneous 
<A NAME="945"></A>inference will be possible not only when both premisses are false but also 
<A NAME="946"></A>when only one is false.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="947"></A><B>Part 17</B>

<A NAME="948"></A><BR><BR>In the case of attributes not atomically connected with or disconnected 
<A NAME="949"></A>from their subjects, (a) (i) as long as the false conclusion is inferred 
<A NAME="950"></A>through the 'appropriate' middle, only the major and not both premisses 
<A NAME="951"></A>can be false. By 'appropriate middle' I mean the middle term through which 
<A NAME="952"></A>the contradictory-i.e. the true-conclusion is inferrible. Thus, let A be 
<A NAME="953"></A>attributable to B through a middle term C: then, since to produce a conclusion 
<A NAME="954"></A>the premiss C-B must be taken affirmatively, it is clear that this premiss 
<A NAME="955"></A>must always be true, for its quality is not changed. But the major A-C 
<A NAME="956"></A>is false, for it is by a change in the quality of A-C that the conclusion 
<A NAME="957"></A>becomes its contradictory-i.e. true. Similarly (ii) if the middle is taken 
<A NAME="958"></A>from another series of predication; e.g. suppose D to be not only contained 
<A NAME="959"></A>within A as a part within its whole but also predicable of all B. Then 
<A NAME="960"></A>the premiss D-B must remain unchanged, but the quality of A-D must be changed; 
<A NAME="961"></A>so that D-B is always true, A-D always false. Such error is practically 
<A NAME="962"></A>identical with that which is inferred through the 'appropriate' middle. 
<A NAME="963"></A>On the other hand, (b) if the conclusion is not inferred through the 'appropriate' 
<A NAME="964"></A>middle-(i) when the middle is subordinate to A but is predicable of no 
<A NAME="965"></A>B, both premisses must be false, because if there is to be a conclusion 
<A NAME="966"></A>both must be posited as asserting the contrary of what is actually the 
<A NAME="967"></A>fact, and so posited both become false: e.g. suppose that actually all 
<A NAME="968"></A>D is A but no B is D; then if these premisses are changed in quality, a 
<A NAME="969"></A>conclusion will follow and both of the new premisses will be false. When, 
<A NAME="970"></A>however, (ii) the middle D is not subordinate to A, A-D will be true, D-B 
<A NAME="971"></A>false-A-D true because A was not subordinate to D, D-B false because if 
<A NAME="972"></A>it had been true, the conclusion too would have been true; but it is ex 
<A NAME="973"></A>hypothesi false.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR><BR>When the erroneous inference is in the second figure, both premisses 
<A NAME="975"></A>cannot be entirely false; since if B is subordinate to A, there can be 
<A NAME="976"></A>no middle predicable of all of one extreme and of none of the other, as 
<A NAME="977"></A>was stated before. One premiss, however, may be false, and it may be either 
<A NAME="978"></A>of them. Thus, if C is actually an attribute of both A and B, but is assumed 
<A NAME="979"></A>to be an attribute of A only and not of B, C-A will be true, C-B false: 
<A NAME="980"></A>or again if C be assumed to be attributable to B but to no A, C-B will 
<A NAME="981"></A>be true, C-A false.
<A NAME="982"></A><BR><BR>We have stated when and through what kinds of premisses error will 
<A NAME="983"></A>result in cases where the erroneous conclusion is negative. If the conclusion 
<A NAME="984"></A>is affirmative, (a) (i) it may be inferred through the 'appropriate' middle 
<A NAME="985"></A>term. In this case both premisses cannot be false since, as we said before, 
<A NAME="986"></A>C-B must remain unchanged if there is to be a conclusion, and consequently 
<A NAME="987"></A>A-C, the quality of which is changed, will always be false. This is equally 
<A NAME="988"></A>true if (ii) the middle is taken from another series of predication, as 
<A NAME="989"></A>was stated to be the case also with regard to negative error; for D-B must 
<A NAME="990"></A>remain unchanged, while the quality of A-D must be converted, and the type 
<A NAME="991"></A>of error is the same as before.
<A NAME="992"></A><BR><BR>(b) The middle may be inappropriate. Then (i) if D is subordinate 
<A NAME="993"></A>to A, A-D will be true, but D-B false; since A may quite well be predicable 
<A NAME="994"></A>of several terms no one of which can be subordinated to another. If, however, 
<A NAME="995"></A>(ii) D is not subordinate to A, obviously A-D, since it is affirmed, will 
<A NAME="996"></A>always be false, while D-B may be either true or false; for A may very 
<A NAME="997"></A>well be an attribute of no D, whereas all B is D, e.g. no science is animal, 
<A NAME="998"></A>all music is science. Equally well A may be an attribute of no D, and D 
<A NAME="999"></A>of no B. It emerges, then, that if the middle term is not subordinate to 
<A NAME="1000"></A>the major, not only both premisses but either singly may be 
<A NAME="1001"></A>false.
<A NAME="1002"></A><BR><BR>Thus we have made it clear how many varieties of erroneous inference 
<A NAME="1003"></A>are liable to happen and through what kinds of premisses they occur, in 
<A NAME="1004"></A>the case both of immediate and of demonstrable truths.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1005"></A><B>Part 18</B>

<A NAME="1006"></A><BR><BR>It is also clear that the loss of any one of the senses entails 
<A NAME="1007"></A>the loss of a corresponding portion of knowledge, and that, since we learn 
<A NAME="1008"></A>either by induction or by demonstration, this knowledge cannot be acquired. 
<A NAME="1009"></A>Thus demonstration develops from universals, induction from particulars; 
<A NAME="1010"></A>but since it is possible to familiarize the pupil with even the so-called 
<A NAME="1011"></A>mathematical abstractions only through induction-i.e. only because each 
<A NAME="1012"></A>subject genus possesses, in virtue of a determinate mathematical character, 
<A NAME="1013"></A>certain properties which can be treated as separate even though they do 
<A NAME="1014"></A>not exist in isolation-it is consequently impossible to come to grasp universals 
<A NAME="1015"></A>except through induction. But induction is impossible for those who have 
<A NAME="1016"></A>not sense-perception. For it is sense-perception alone which is adequate 
<A NAME="1017"></A>for grasping the particulars: they cannot be objects of scientific knowledge, 
<A NAME="1018"></A>because neither can universals give us knowledge of them without induction, 
<A NAME="1019"></A>nor can we get it through induction without sense-perception.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1020"></A><B>Part 19</B>

<A NAME="1021"></A><BR><BR>Every syllogism is effected by means of three terms. One kind of 
<A NAME="1022"></A>syllogism serves to prove that A inheres in C by showing that A inheres 
<A NAME="1023"></A>in B and B in C; the other is negative and one of its premisses asserts 
<A NAME="1024"></A>one term of another, while the other denies one term of another. It is 
<A NAME="1025"></A>clear, then, that these are the fundamentals and so-called hypotheses of 
<A NAME="1026"></A>syllogism. Assume them as they have been stated, and proof is bound to 
<A NAME="1027"></A>follow-proof that A inheres in C through B, and again that A inheres in 
<A NAME="1028"></A>B through some other middle term, and similarly that B inheres in C. If 
<A NAME="1029"></A>our reasoning aims at gaining credence and so is merely dialectical, it 
<A NAME="1030"></A>is obvious that we have only to see that our inference is based on premisses 
<A NAME="1031"></A>as credible as possible: so that if a middle term between A and B is credible 
<A NAME="1032"></A>though not real, one can reason through it and complete a dialectical syllogism. 
<A NAME="1033"></A>If, however, one is aiming at truth, one must be guided by the real connexions 
<A NAME="1034"></A>of subjects and attributes. Thus: since there are attributes which are 
<A NAME="1035"></A>predicated of a subject essentially or naturally and not coincidentally-not, 
<A NAME="1036"></A>that is, in the sense in which we say 'That white (thing) is a man', which 
<A NAME="1037"></A>is not the same mode of predication as when we say 'The man is white': 
<A NAME="1038"></A>the man is white not because he is something else but because he is man, 
<A NAME="1039"></A>but the white is man because 'being white' coincides with 'humanity' within 
<A NAME="1040"></A>one substratum-therefore there are terms such as are naturally subjects 
<A NAME="1041"></A>of predicates. Suppose, then, C such a term not itself attributable to 
<A NAME="1042"></A>anything else as to a subject, but the proximate subject of the attribute 
<A NAME="1043"></A>B--i.e. so that B-C is immediate; suppose further E related immediately 
<A NAME="1044"></A>to F, and F to B. The first question is, must this series terminate, or 
<A NAME="1045"></A>can it proceed to infinity? The second question is as follows: Suppose 
<A NAME="1046"></A>nothing is essentially predicated of A, but A is predicated primarily of 
<A NAME="1047"></A>H and of no intermediate prior term, and suppose H similarly related to 
<A NAME="1048"></A>G and G to B; then must this series also terminate, or can it too proceed 
<A NAME="1049"></A>to infinity? There is this much difference between the questions: the first 
<A NAME="1050"></A>is, is it possible to start from that which is not itself attributable 
<A NAME="1051"></A>to anything else but is the subject of attributes, and ascend to infinity? 
<A NAME="1052"></A>The second is the problem whether one can start from that which is a predicate 
<A NAME="1053"></A>but not itself a subject of predicates, and descend to infinity? A third 
<A NAME="1054"></A>question is, if the extreme terms are fixed, can there be an infinity of 
<A NAME="1055"></A>middles? I mean this: suppose for example that A inheres in C and B is 
<A NAME="1056"></A>intermediate between them, but between B and A there are other middles, 
<A NAME="1057"></A>and between these again fresh middles; can these proceed to infinity or 
<A NAME="1058"></A>can they not? This is the equivalent of inquiring, do demonstrations proceed 
<A NAME="1059"></A>to infinity, i.e. is everything demonstrable? Or do ultimate subject and 
<A NAME="1060"></A>primary attribute limit one another?
<A NAME="1061"></A><BR><BR>I hold that the same questions arise with regard to negative conclusions 
<A NAME="1062"></A>and premisses: viz. if A is attributable to no B, then either this predication 
<A NAME="1063"></A>will be primary, or there will be an intermediate term prior to B to which 
<A NAME="1064"></A>a is not attributable-G, let us say, which is attributable to all B-and 
<A NAME="1065"></A>there may still be another term H prior to G, which is attributable to 
<A NAME="1066"></A>all G. The same questions arise, I say, because in these cases too either 
<A NAME="1067"></A>the series of prior terms to which a is not attributable is infinite or 
<A NAME="1068"></A>it terminates.
<A NAME="1069"></A><BR><BR>One cannot ask the same questions in the case of reciprocating 
<A NAME="1070"></A>terms, since when subject and predicate are convertible there is neither 
<A NAME="1071"></A>primary nor ultimate subject, seeing that all the reciprocals qua subjects 
<A NAME="1072"></A>stand in the same relation to one another, whether we say that the subject 
<A NAME="1073"></A>has an infinity of attributes or that both subjects and attributes-and 
<A NAME="1074"></A>we raised the question in both cases-are infinite in number. These questions 
<A NAME="1075"></A>then cannot be asked-unless, indeed, the terms can reciprocate by two different 
<A NAME="1076"></A>modes, by accidental predication in one relation and natural predication 
<A NAME="1077"></A>in the other.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1078"></A><B>Part 20</B>

<A NAME="1079"></A><BR><BR>Now, it is clear that if the predications terminate in both the 
<A NAME="1080"></A>upward and the downward direction (by 'upward' I mean the ascent to the 
<A NAME="1081"></A>more universal, by 'downward' the descent to the more particular), the 
<A NAME="1082"></A>middle terms cannot be infinite in number. For suppose that A is predicated 
<A NAME="1083"></A>of F, and that the intermediates-call them BB'B"...-are infinite, then 
<A NAME="1084"></A>clearly you might descend from and find one term predicated of another 
<A NAME="1085"></A>ad infinitum, since you have an infinity of terms between you and F; and 
<A NAME="1086"></A>equally, if you ascend from F, there are infinite terms between you and 
<A NAME="1087"></A>A. It follows that if these processes are impossible there cannot be an 
<A NAME="1088"></A>infinity of intermediates between A and F. Nor is it of any effect to urge 
<A NAME="1089"></A>that some terms of the series AB...F are contiguous so as to exclude intermediates, 
<A NAME="1090"></A>while others cannot be taken into the argument at all: whichever terms 
<A NAME="1091"></A>of the series B...I take, the number of intermediates in the direction 
<A NAME="1092"></A>either of A or of F must be finite or infinite: where the infinite series 
<A NAME="1093"></A>starts, whether from the first term or from a lat
