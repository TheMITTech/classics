<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Let the foregoing suffice as our account of the views concerning the soul 
<A NAME="12"></A>which have been handed on by our predecessors; let us now dismiss them 
<A NAME="13"></A>and make as it were a completely fresh start, endeavouring to give a precise 
<A NAME="14"></A>answer to the question, What is soul? i.e. to formulate the most general 
<A NAME="15"></A>possible definition of it.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>We are in the habit of recognizing, as one determinate kind of 
<A NAME="17"></A>what is, substance, and that in several senses, (a) in the sense of matter 
<A NAME="18"></A>or that which in itself is not 'a this', and (b) in the sense of form or 
<A NAME="19"></A>essence, which is that precisely in virtue of which a thing is called 'a 
<A NAME="20"></A>this', and thirdly (c) in the sense of that which is compounded of both 
<A NAME="21"></A>(a) and (b). Now matter is potentiality, form actuality; of the latter 
<A NAME="22"></A>there are two grades related to one another as e.g. knowledge to the exercise 
<A NAME="23"></A>of knowledge.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>Among substances are by general consent reckoned bodies and especially 
<A NAME="25"></A>natural bodies; for they are the principles of all other bodies. Of natural 
<A NAME="26"></A>bodies some have life in them, others not; by life we mean self-nutrition 
<A NAME="27"></A>and growth (with its correlative decay). It follows that every natural 
<A NAME="28"></A>body which has life in it is a substance in the sense of a 
<A NAME="29"></A>composite.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>But since it is also a body of such and such a kind, viz. having 
<A NAME="31"></A>life, the body cannot be soul; the body is the subject or matter, not what 
<A NAME="32"></A>is attributed to it. Hence the soul must be a substance in the sense of 
<A NAME="33"></A>the form of a natural body having life potentially within it. But substance 
<A NAME="34"></A>is actuality, and thus soul is the actuality of a body as above characterized. 
<A NAME="35"></A>Now the word actuality has two senses corresponding respectively to the 
<A NAME="36"></A>possession of knowledge and the actual exercise of knowledge. It is obvious 
<A NAME="37"></A>that the soul is actuality in the first sense, viz. that of knowledge as 
<A NAME="38"></A>possessed, for both sleeping and waking presuppose the existence of soul, 
<A NAME="39"></A>and of these waking corresponds to actual knowing, sleeping to knowledge 
<A NAME="40"></A>possessed but not employed, and, in the history of the individual, knowledge 
<A NAME="41"></A>comes before its employment or exercise.
<A NAME="42"></A><BR><BR>That is why the soul is the first grade of actuality of a natural 
<A NAME="43"></A>body having life potentially in it. The body so described is a body which 
<A NAME="44"></A>is organized. The parts of plants in spite of their extreme simplicity 
<A NAME="45"></A>are 'organs'; e.g. the leaf serves to shelter the pericarp, the pericarp 
<A NAME="46"></A>to shelter the fruit, while the roots of plants are analogous to the mouth 
<A NAME="47"></A>of animals, both serving for the absorption of food. If, then, we have 
<A NAME="48"></A>to give a general formula applicable to all kinds of soul, we must describe 
<A NAME="49"></A>it as the first grade of actuality of a natural organized body. That is 
<A NAME="50"></A>why we can wholly dismiss as unnecessary the question whether the soul 
<A NAME="51"></A>and the body are one: it is as meaningless as to ask whether the wax and 
<A NAME="52"></A>the shape given to it by the stamp are one, or generally the matter of 
<A NAME="53"></A>a thing and that of which it is the matter. Unity has many senses (as many 
<A NAME="54"></A>as 'is' has), but the most proper and fundamental sense of both is the 
<A NAME="55"></A>relation of an actuality to that of which it is the actuality. We have 
<A NAME="56"></A>now given an answer to the question, What is soul?-an answer which applies 
<A NAME="57"></A>to it in its full extent. It is substance in the sense which corresponds 
<A NAME="58"></A>to the definitive formula of a thing's essence. That means that it is 'the 
<A NAME="59"></A>essential whatness' of a body of the character just assigned. Suppose that 
<A NAME="60"></A>what is literally an 'organ', like an axe, were a natural body, its 'essential 
<A NAME="61"></A>whatness', would have been its essence, and so its soul; if this disappeared 
<A NAME="62"></A>from it, it would have ceased to be an axe, except in name. As it is, it 
<A NAME="63"></A>is just an axe; it wants the character which is required to make its whatness 
<A NAME="64"></A>or formulable essence a soul; for that, it would have had to be a natural 
<A NAME="65"></A>body of a particular kind, viz. one having in itself the power of setting 
<A NAME="66"></A>itself in movement and arresting itself. Next, apply this doctrine in the 
<A NAME="67"></A>case of the 'parts' of the living body. Suppose that the eye were an animal-sight 
<A NAME="68"></A>would have been its soul, for sight is the substance or essence of the 
<A NAME="69"></A>eye which corresponds to the formula, the eye being merely the matter of 
<A NAME="70"></A>seeing; when seeing is removed the eye is no longer an eye, except in name-it 
<A NAME="71"></A>is no more a real eye than the eye of a statue or of a painted figure. 
<A NAME="72"></A>We must now extend our consideration from the 'parts' to the whole living 
<A NAME="73"></A>body; for what the departmental sense is to the bodily part which is its 
<A NAME="74"></A>organ, that the whole faculty of sense is to the whole sensitive body as 
<A NAME="75"></A>such.
<A NAME="76"></A><BR><BR>We must not understand by that which is 'potentially capable of 
<A NAME="77"></A>living' what has lost the soul it had, but only what still retains it; 
<A NAME="78"></A>but seeds and fruits are bodies which possess the qualification. Consequently, 
<A NAME="79"></A>while waking is actuality in a sense corresponding to the cutting and the 
<A NAME="80"></A>seeing, the soul is actuality in the sense corresponding to the power of 
<A NAME="81"></A>sight and the power in the tool; the body corresponds to what exists in 
<A NAME="82"></A>potentiality; as the pupil plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, 
<A NAME="83"></A>so the soul plus the body constitutes the animal.
<A NAME="84"></A><BR><BR>From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from 
<A NAME="85"></A>its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts) 
<A NAME="86"></A>for the actuality of some of them is nothing but the actualities of their 
<A NAME="87"></A>bodily parts. Yet some may be separable because they are not the actualities 
<A NAME="88"></A>of any body at all. Further, we have no light on the problem whether the 
<A NAME="89"></A>soul may not be the actuality of its body in the sense in which the sailor 
<A NAME="90"></A>is the actuality of the ship.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>This must suffice as our sketch or outline determination of the 
<A NAME="92"></A>nature of soul.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="93"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="94"></A><BR><BR>Since what is clear or logically more evident emerges from what 
<A NAME="95"></A>in itself is confused but more observable by us, we must reconsider our 
<A NAME="96"></A>results from this point of view. For it is not enough for a definitive 
<A NAME="97"></A>formula to express as most now do the mere fact; it must include and exhibit 
<A NAME="98"></A>the ground also. At present definitions are given in a form analogous to 
<A NAME="99"></A>the conclusion of a syllogism; e.g. What is squaring? The construction 
<A NAME="100"></A>of an equilateral rectangle equal to a given oblong rectangle. Such a definition 
<A NAME="101"></A>is in form equivalent to a conclusion. One that tells us that squaring 
<A NAME="102"></A>is the discovery of a line which is a mean proportional between the two 
<A NAME="103"></A>unequal sides of the given rectangle discloses the ground of what is 
<A NAME="104"></A>defined.
<A NAME="105"></A><BR><BR>We resume our inquiry from a fresh starting-point by calling attention 
<A NAME="106"></A>to the fact that what has soul in it differs from what has not, in that 
<A NAME="107"></A>the former displays life. Now this word has more than one sense, and provided 
<A NAME="108"></A>any one alone of these is found in a thing we say that thing is living. 
<A NAME="109"></A>Living, that is, may mean thinking or perception or local movement and 
<A NAME="110"></A>rest, or movement in the sense of nutrition, decay and growth. Hence we 
<A NAME="111"></A>think of plants also as living, for they are observed to possess in themselves 
<A NAME="112"></A>an originative power through which they increase or decrease in all spatial 
<A NAME="113"></A>directions; they grow up and down, and everything that grows increases 
<A NAME="114"></A>its bulk alike in both directions or indeed in all, and continues to live 
<A NAME="115"></A>so long as it can absorb nutriment.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>This power of self-nutrition can be isolated from the other powers 
<A NAME="117"></A>mentioned, but not they from it-in mortal beings at least. The fact is 
<A NAME="118"></A>obvious in plants; for it is the only psychic power they 
<A NAME="119"></A>possess.
<A NAME="120"></A><BR><BR>This is the originative power the possession of which leads us 
<A NAME="121"></A>to speak of things as living at all, but it is the possession of sensation 
<A NAME="122"></A>that leads us for the first time to speak of living things as animals; 
<A NAME="123"></A>for even those beings which possess no power of local movement but do possess 
<A NAME="124"></A>the power of sensation we call animals and not merely living 
<A NAME="125"></A>things.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>The primary form of sense is touch, which belongs to all animals. 
<A NAME="127"></A>just as the power of self-nutrition can be isolated from touch and sensation 
<A NAME="128"></A>generally, so touch can be isolated from all other forms of sense. (By 
<A NAME="129"></A>the power of self-nutrition we mean that departmental power of the soul 
<A NAME="130"></A>which is common to plants and animals: all animals whatsoever are observed 
<A NAME="131"></A>to have the sense of touch.) What the explanation of these two facts is, 
<A NAME="132"></A>we must discuss later. At present we must confine ourselves to saying that 
<A NAME="133"></A>soul is the source of these phenomena and is characterized by them, viz. 
<A NAME="134"></A>by the powers of self-nutrition, sensation, thinking, and 
<A NAME="135"></A>motivity.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>Is each of these a soul or a part of a soul? And if a part, a part 
<A NAME="137"></A>in what sense? A part merely distinguishable by definition or a part distinct 
<A NAME="138"></A>in local situation as well? In the case of certain of these powers, the 
<A NAME="139"></A>answers to these questions are easy, in the case of others we are puzzled 
<A NAME="140"></A>what to say. just as in the case of plants which when divided are observed 
<A NAME="141"></A>to continue to live though removed to a distance from one another (thus 
<A NAME="142"></A>showing that in their case the soul of each individual plant before division 
<A NAME="143"></A>was actually one, potentially many), so we notice a similar result in other 
<A NAME="144"></A>varieties of soul, i.e. in insects which have been cut in two; each of 
<A NAME="145"></A>the segments possesses both sensation and local movement; and if sensation, 
<A NAME="146"></A>necessarily also imagination and appetition; for, where there is sensation, 
<A NAME="147"></A>there is also pleasure and pain, and, where these, necessarily also 
<A NAME="148"></A>desire.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>We have no evidence as yet about mind or the power to think; it 
<A NAME="150"></A>seems to be a widely different kind of soul, differing as what is eternal 
<A NAME="151"></A>from what is perishable; it alone is capable of existence in isolation 
<A NAME="152"></A>from all other psychic powers. All the other parts of soul, it is evident 
<A NAME="153"></A>from what we have said, are, in spite of certain statements to the contrary, 
<A NAME="154"></A>incapable of separate existence though, of course, distinguishable by definition. 
<A NAME="155"></A>If opining is distinct from perceiving, to be capable of opining and to 
<A NAME="156"></A>be capable of perceiving must be distinct, and so with all the other forms 
<A NAME="157"></A>of living above enumerated. Further, some animals possess all these parts 
<A NAME="158"></A>of soul, some certain of them only, others one only (this is what enables 
<A NAME="159"></A>us to classify animals); the cause must be considered later.' A similar 
<A NAME="160"></A>arrangement is found also within the field of the senses; some classes 
<A NAME="161"></A>of animals have all the senses, some only certain of them, others only 
<A NAME="162"></A>one, the most indispensable, touch.
<A NAME="163"></A><BR><BR>Since the expression 'that whereby we live and perceive' has two 
<A NAME="164"></A>meanings, just like the expression 'that whereby we know'-that may mean 
<A NAME="165"></A>either (a) knowledge or (b) the soul, for we can speak of knowing by or 
<A NAME="166"></A>with either, and similarly that whereby we are in health may be either 
<A NAME="167"></A>(a) health or (b) the body or some part of the body; and since of the two 
<A NAME="168"></A>terms thus contrasted knowledge or health is the name of a form, essence, 
<A NAME="169"></A>or ratio, or if we so express it an actuality of a recipient matter-knowledge 
<A NAME="170"></A>of what is capable of knowing, health of what is capable of being made 
<A NAME="171"></A>healthy (for the operation of that which is capable of originating change 
<A NAME="172"></A>terminates and has its seat in what is changed or altered); further, since 
<A NAME="173"></A>it is the soul by or with which primarily we live, perceive, and think:-it 
<A NAME="174"></A>follows that the soul must be a ratio or formulable essence, not a matter 
<A NAME="175"></A>or subject. For, as we said, word substance has three meanings form, matter, 
<A NAME="176"></A>and the complex of both and of these three what is called matter is potentiality, 
<A NAME="177"></A>what is called form actuality. Since then the complex here is the living 
<A NAME="178"></A>thing, the body cannot be the actuality of the soul; it is the soul which 
<A NAME="179"></A>is the actuality of a certain kind of body. Hence the rightness of the 
<A NAME="180"></A>view that the soul cannot be without a body, while it csnnot he a body; 
<A NAME="181"></A>it is not a body but something relative to a body. That is why it is in 
<A NAME="182"></A>a body, and a body of a definite kind. It was a mistake, therefore, to 
<A NAME="183"></A>do as former thinkers did, merely to fit it into a body without adding 
<A NAME="184"></A>a definite specification of the kind or character of that body. Reflection 
<A NAME="185"></A>confirms the observed fact; the actuality of any given thing can only be 
<A NAME="186"></A>realized in what is already potentially that thing, i.e. in a matter of 
<A NAME="187"></A>its own appropriate to it. From all this it follows that soul is an actuality 
<A NAME="188"></A>or formulable essence of something that possesses a potentiality of being 
<A NAME="189"></A>besouled.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="190"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>Of the psychic powers above enumerated some kinds of living things, 
<A NAME="192"></A>as we have said, possess all, some less than all, others one only. Those 
<A NAME="193"></A>we have mentioned are the nutritive, the appetitive, the sensory, the locomotive, 
<A NAME="194"></A>and the power of thinking. Plants have none but the first, the nutritive, 
<A NAME="195"></A>while another order of living things has this plus the sensory. If any 
<A NAME="196"></A>order of living things has the sensory, it must also have the appetitive; 
<A NAME="197"></A>for appetite is the genus of which desire, passion, and wish are the species; 
<A NAME="198"></A>now all animals have one sense at least, viz. touch, and whatever has a 
<A NAME="199"></A>sense has the capacity for pleasure and pain and therefore has pleasant 
<A NAME="200"></A>and painful objects present to it, and wherever these are present, there 
<A NAME="201"></A>is desire, for desire is just appetition of what is pleasant. Further, 
<A NAME="202"></A>all animals have the sense for food (for touch is the sense for food); 
<A NAME="203"></A>the food of all living things consists of what is dry, moist, hot, cold, 
<A NAME="204"></A>and these are the qualities apprehended by touch; all other sensible qualities 
<A NAME="205"></A>are apprehended by touch only indirectly. Sounds, colours, and odours contribute 
<A NAME="206"></A>nothing to nutriment; flavours fall within the field of tangible qualities. 
<A NAME="207"></A>Hunger and thirst are forms of desire, hunger a desire for what is dry 
<A NAME="208"></A>and hot, thirst a desire for what is cold and moist; flavour is a sort 
<A NAME="209"></A>of seasoning added to both. We must later clear up these points, but at 
<A NAME="210"></A>present it may be enough to say that all animals that possess the sense 
<A NAME="211"></A>of touch have also appetition. The case of imagination is obscure; we must 
<A NAME="212"></A>examine it later. Certain kinds of animals possess in addition the power 
<A NAME="213"></A>of locomotion, and still another order of animate beings, i.e. man and 
<A NAME="214"></A>possibly another order like man or superior to him, the power of thinking, 
<A NAME="215"></A>i.e. mind. It is now evident that a single definition can be given of soul 
<A NAME="216"></A>only in the same sense as one can be given of figure. For, as in that case 
<A NAME="217"></A>there is no figure distinguishable and apart from triangle, &c., so here 
<A NAME="218"></A>there is no soul apart from the forms of soul just enumerated. It is true 
<A NAME="219"></A>that a highly general definition can be given for figure which will fit 
<A NAME="220"></A>all figures without expressing the peculiar nature of any figure. So here 
<A NAME="221"></A>in the case of soul and its specific forms. Hence it is absurd in this 
<A NAME="222"></A>and similar cases to demand an absolutely general definition which will 
<A NAME="223"></A>fail to express the peculiar nature of anything that is, or again, omitting 
<A NAME="224"></A>this, to look for separate definitions corresponding to each infima species. 
<A NAME="225"></A>The cases of figure and soul are exactly parallel; for the particulars 
<A NAME="226"></A>subsumed under the common name in both cases-figures and living beings-constitute 
<A NAME="227"></A>a series, each successive term of which potentially contains its predecessor, 
<A NAME="228"></A>e.g. the square the triangle, the sensory power the self-nutritive. Hence 
<A NAME="229"></A>we must ask in the case of each order of living things, What is its soul, 
<A NAME="230"></A>i.e. What is the soul of plant, animal, man? Why the terms are related 
<A NAME="231"></A>in this serial way must form the subject of later examination. But the 
<A NAME="232"></A>facts are that the power of perception is never found apart from the power 
<A NAME="233"></A>of self-nutrition, while-in plants-the latter is found isolated from the 
<A NAME="234"></A>former. Again, no sense is found apart from that of touch, while touch 
<A NAME="235"></A>is found by itself; many animals have neither sight, hearing, nor smell. 
<A NAME="236"></A>Again, among living things that possess sense some have the power of locomotion, 
<A NAME="237"></A>some not. Lastly, certain living beings-a small minority-possess calculation 
<A NAME="238"></A>and thought, for (among mortal beings) those which possess calculation 
<A NAME="239"></A>have all the other powers above mentioned, while the converse does not 
<A NAME="240"></A>hold-indeed some live by imagination alone, while others have not even 
<A NAME="241"></A>imagination. The mind that knows with immediate intuition presents a different 
<A NAME="242"></A>problem.
<A NAME="243"></A><BR><BR>It is evident that the way to give the most adequate definition 
<A NAME="244"></A>of soul is to seek in the case of each of its forms for the most appropriate 
<A NAME="245"></A>definition.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="246"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="247"></A><BR><BR>It is necessary for the student of these forms of soul first to 
<A NAME="248"></A>find a definition of each, expressive of what it is, and then to investigate 
<A NAME="249"></A>its derivative properties, &c. But if we are to express what each is, viz. 
<A NAME="250"></A>what the thinking power is, or the perceptive, or the nutritive, we must 
<A NAME="251"></A>go farther back and first give an account of thinking or perceiving, for 
<A NAME="252"></A>in the order of investigation the question of what an agent does precedes 
<A NAME="253"></A>the question, what enables it to do what it does. If this is correct, we 
<A NAME="254"></A>must on the same ground go yet another step farther back and have some 
<A NAME="255"></A>clear view of the objects of each; thus we must start with these objects, 
<A NAME="256"></A>e.g. with food, with what is perceptible, or with what is 
<A NAME="257"></A>intelligible.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>It follows that first of all we must treat of nutrition and reproduction, 
<A NAME="259"></A>for the nutritive soul is found along with all the others and is the most 
<A NAME="260"></A>primitive and widely distributed power of soul, being indeed that one in 
<A NAME="261"></A>virtue of which all are said to have life. The acts in which it manifests 
<A NAME="262"></A>itself are reproduction and the use of food-reproduction, I say, because 
<A NAME="263"></A>for any living thing that has reached its normal development and which 
<A NAME="264"></A>is unmutilated, and whose mode of generation is not spontaneous, the most 
<A NAME="265"></A>natural act is the production of another like itself, an animal producing 
<A NAME="266"></A>an animal, a plant a plant, in order that, as far as its nature allows, 
<A NAME="267"></A>it may partake in the eternal and divine. That is the goal towards which 
<A NAME="268"></A>all things strive, that for the sake of which they do whatsoever their 
<A NAME="269"></A>nature renders possible. The phrase 'for the sake of which' is ambiguous; 
<A NAME="270"></A>it may mean either (a) the end to achieve which, or (b) the being in whose 
<A NAME="271"></A>interest, the act is done. Since then no living thing is able to partake 
<A NAME="272"></A>in what is eternal and divine by uninterrupted continuance (for nothing 
<A NAME="273"></A>perishable can for ever remain one and the same), it tries to achieve that 
<A NAME="274"></A>end in the only way possible to it, and success is possible in varying 
<A NAME="275"></A>degrees; so it remains not indeed as the self-same individual but continues 
<A NAME="276"></A>its existence in something like itself-not numerically but specifically 
<A NAME="277"></A>one.
<A NAME="278"></A><BR><BR>The soul is the cause or source of the living body. The terms cause 
<A NAME="279"></A>and source have many senses. But the soul is the cause of its body alike 
<A NAME="280"></A>in all three senses which we explicitly recognize. It is (a) the source 
<A NAME="281"></A>or origin of movement, it is (b) the end, it is (c) the essence of the 
<A NAME="282"></A>whole living body.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>That it is the last, is clear; for in everything the essence is 
<A NAME="284"></A>identical with the ground of its being, and here, in the case of living 
<A NAME="285"></A>things, their being is to live, and of their being and their living the 
<A NAME="286"></A>soul in them is the cause or source. Further, the actuality of whatever 
<A NAME="287"></A>is potential is identical with its formulable essence.
<A NAME="288"></A><BR><BR>It is manifest that the soul is also the final cause of its body. 
<A NAME="289"></A>For Nature, like mind, always does whatever it does for the sake of something, 
<A NAME="290"></A>which something is its end. To that something corresponds in the case of 
<A NAME="291"></A>animals the soul and in this it follows the order of nature; all natural 
<A NAME="292"></A>bodies are organs of the soul. This is true of those that enter into the 
<A NAME="293"></A>constitution of plants as well as of those which enter into that of animals. 
<A NAME="294"></A>This shows that that the sake of which they are is soul. We must here recall 
<A NAME="295"></A>the two senses of 'that for the sake of which', viz. (a) the end to achieve 
<A NAME="296"></A>which, and (b) the being in whose interest, anything is or is 
<A NAME="297"></A>done.
<A NAME="298"></A><BR><BR>We must maintain, further, that the soul is also the cause of the 
<A NAME="299"></A>living body as the original source of local movement. The power of locomotion 
<A NAME="300"></A>is not found, however, in all living things. But change of quality and 
<A NAME="301"></A>change of quantity are also due to the soul. Sensation is held to be a 
<A NAME="302"></A>qualitative alteration, and nothing except what has soul in it is capable 
<A NAME="303"></A>of sensation. The same holds of the quantitative changes which constitute 
<A NAME="304"></A>growth and decay; nothing grows or decays naturally except what feeds itself, 
<A NAME="305"></A>and nothing feeds itself except what has a share of soul in 
<A NAME="306"></A>it.
<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>Empedocles is wrong in adding that growth in plants is to be explained, 
<A NAME="308"></A>the downward rooting by the natural tendency of earth to travel downwards, 
<A NAME="309"></A>and the upward branching by the similar natural tendency of fire to travel 
<A NAME="310"></A>upwards. For he misinterprets up and down; up and down are not for all 
<A NAME="311"></A>things what they are for the whole Cosmos: if we are to distinguish and 
<A NAME="312"></A>identify organs according to their functions, the roots of plants are analogous 
<A NAME="313"></A>to the head in animals. Further, we must ask what is the force that holds 
<A NAME="314"></A>together the earth and the fire which tend to travel in contrary directions; 
<A NAME="315"></A>if there is no counteracting force, they will be torn asunder; if there 
<A NAME="316"></A>is, this must be the soul and the cause of nutrition and growth. By some 
<A NAME="317"></A>the element of fire is held to be the cause of nutrition and growth, for 
<A NAME="318"></A>it alone of the primary bodies or elements is observed to feed and increase 
<A NAME="319"></A>itself. Hence the suggestion that in both plants and animals it is it which 
<A NAME="320"></A>is the operative force. A concurrent cause in a sense it certainly is, 
<A NAME="321"></A>but not the principal cause, that is rather the soul; for while the growth 
<A NAME="322"></A>of fire goes on without limit so long as there is a supply of fuel, in 
<A NAME="323"></A>the case of all complex wholes formed in the course of nature there is 
<A NAME="324"></A>a limit or ratio which determines their size and increase, and limit and 
<A NAME="325"></A>ratio are marks of soul but not of fire, and belong to the side of formulable 
<A NAME="326"></A>essence rather than that of matter.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>Nutrition and reproduction are due to one and the same psychic 
<A NAME="328"></A>power. It is necessary first to give precision to our account of food, 
<A NAME="329"></A>for it is by this function of absorbing food that this psychic power is 
<A NAME="330"></A>distinguished from all the others. The current view is that what serves 
<A NAME="331"></A>as food to a living thing is what is contrary to it-not that in every pair 
<A NAME="332"></A>of contraries each is food to the other: to be food a contrary must not 
<A NAME="333"></A>only be transformable into the other and vice versa, it must also in so 
<A NAME="334"></A>doing increase the bulk of the other. Many a contrary is transformed into 
<A NAME="335"></A>its other and vice versa, where neither is even a quantum and so cannot 
<A NAME="336"></A>increase in bulk, e.g. an invalid into a healthy subject. It is clear that 
<A NAME="337"></A>not even those contraries which satisfy both the conditions mentioned above 
<A NAME="338"></A>are food to one another in precisely the same sense; water may be said 
<A NAME="339"></A>to feed fire, but not fire water. Where the members of the pair are elementary 
<A NAME="340"></A>bodies only one of the contraries, it would appear, can be said to feed 
<A NAME="341"></A>the other. But there is a difficulty here. One set of thinkers assert that 
<A NAME="342"></A>like fed, as well as increased in amount, by like. Another set, as we have 
<A NAME="343"></A>said, maintain the very reverse, viz. that what feeds and what is fed are 
<A NAME="344"></A>contrary to one another; like, they argue, is incapable of being affected 
<A NAME="345"></A>by like; but food is changed in the process of digestion, and change is 
<A NAME="346"></A>always to what is opposite or to what is intermediate. Further, food is 
<A NAME="347"></A>acted upon by what is nourished by it, not the other way round, as timber 
<A NAME="348"></A>is worked by a carpenter and not conversely; there is a change in the carpenter 
<A NAME="349"></A>but it is merely a change from not-working to working. In answering this 
<A NAME="350"></A>problem it makes all the difference whether we mean by 'the food' the 'finished' 
<A NAME="351"></A>or the 'raw' product. If we use the word food of both, viz. of the completely 
<A NAME="352"></A>undigested and the completely digested matter, we can justify both the 
<A NAME="353"></A>rival accounts of it; taking food in the sense of undigested matter, it 
<A NAME="354"></A>is the contrary of what is fed by it, taking it as digested it is like 
<A NAME="355"></A>what is fed by it. Consequently it is clear that in a certain sense we 
<A NAME="356"></A>may say that both parties are right, both wrong.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>Since nothing except what is alive can be fed, what is fed is the 
<A NAME="358"></A>besouled body and just because it has soul in it. Hence food is essentially 
<A NAME="359"></A>related to what has soul in it. Food has a power which is other than the 
<A NAME="360"></A>power to increase the bulk of what is fed by it; so far forth as what has 
<A NAME="361"></A>soul in it is a quantum, food may increase its quantity, but it is only 
<A NAME="362"></A>so far as what has soul in it is a 'this-somewhat' or substance that food 
<A NAME="363"></A>acts as food; in that case it maintains the being of what is fed, and that 
<A NAME="364"></A>continues to be what it is so long as the process of nutrition continues. 
<A NAME="365"></A>Further, it is the agent in generation, i.e. not the generation of the 
<A NAME="366"></A>individual fed but the reproduction of another like it; the substance of 
<A NAME="367"></A>the individual fed is already in existence; the existence of no substance 
<A NAME="368"></A>is a self-generation but only a self-maintenance.
<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>Hence the psychic power which we are now studying may be described 
<A NAME="370"></A>as that which tends to maintain whatever has this power in it of continuing 
<A NAME="371"></A>such as it was, and food helps it to do its work. That is why, if deprived 
<A NAME="372"></A>of food, it must cease to be.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>The process of nutrition involves three factors, (a) what is fed, 
<A NAME="374"></A>(b) that wherewith it is fed, (c) what does the feeding; of these (c) is 
<A NAME="375"></A>the first soul, (a) the body which has that soul in it, (b) the food. But 
<A NAME="376"></A>since it is right to call things after the ends they realize, and the end 
<A NAME="377"></A>of this soul is to generate another being like that in which it is, the 
<A NAME="378"></A>first soul ought to be named the reproductive soul. The expression (b) 
<A NAME="379"></A>'wherewith it is fed' is ambiguous just as is the expression 'wherewith 
<A NAME="380"></A>the ship is steered'; that may mean either (i) the hand or (ii) the rudder, 
<A NAME="381"></A>i.e. either (i) what is moved and sets in movement, or (ii) what is merely 
<A NAME="382"></A>moved. We can apply this analogy here if we recall that all food must be 
<A NAME="383"></A>capable of being digested, and that what produces digestion is warmth; 
<A NAME="384"></A>that is why everything that has soul in it possesses 
<A NAME="385"></A>warmth.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>We have now given an outline account of the nature of food; further 
<A NAME="387"></A>details must be given in the appropriate place.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="388"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="389"></A><BR><BR>Having made these distinctions let us now speak of sensation in 
<A NAME="390"></A>the widest sense. Sensation depends, as we have said, on a process of movement 
<A NAME="391"></A>or affection from without, for it is held to be some sort of change of 
<A NAME="392"></A>quality. Now some thinkers assert that like is affected only by like; in 
<A NAME="393"></A>what sense this is possible and in what sense impossible, we have explained 
<A NAME="394"></A>in our general discussion of acting and being acted 
<A NAME="395"></A>upon.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>Here arises a problem: why do we not perceive the senses themselves 
<A NAME="397"></A>as well as the external objects of sense, or why without the stimulation 
<A NAME="398"></A>of external objects do they not produce sensation, seeing that they contain 
<A NAME="399"></A>in themselves fire, earth, and all the other elements, which are the direct 
<A NAME="400"></A>or indirect objects is so of sense? It is clear that what is sensitive 
<A NAME="401"></A>is only potentially, not actually. The power of sense is parallel to what 
<A NAME="402"></A>is combustible, for that never ignites itself spontaneously, but requires 
<A NAME="403"></A>an agent which has the power of starting ignition; otherwise it could have 
<A NAME="404"></A>set itself on fire, and would not have needed actual fire to set it 
<A NAME="405"></A>ablaze.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR>In reply we must recall that we use the word 'perceive' in two 
<A NAME="407"></A>ways, for we say (a) that what has the power to hear or see, 'sees' or 
<A NAME="408"></A>'hears', even though it is at the moment asleep, and also (b) that what 
<A NAME="409"></A>is actually seeing or hearing, 'sees' or 'hears'. Hence 'sense' too must 
<A NAME="410"></A>have two meanings, sense potential, and sense actual. Similarly 'to be 
<A NAME="411"></A>a sentient' means either (a) to have a certain power or (b) to manifest 
<A NAME="412"></A>a certain activity. To begin with, for a time, let us speak as if there 
<A NAME="413"></A>were no difference between (i) being moved or affected, and (ii) being 
<A NAME="414"></A>active, for movement is a kind of activity-an imperfect kind, as has elsewhere 
<A NAME="415"></A>been explained. Everything that is acted upon or moved is acted upon by 
<A NAME="416"></A>an agent which is actually at work. Hence it is that in one sense, as has 
<A NAME="417"></A>already been stated, what acts and what is acted upon are like, in another 
<A NAME="418"></A>unlike, i.e. prior to and during the change the two factors are unlike, 
<A NAME="419"></A>after it like.
<A NAME="420"></A><BR><BR>But we must now distinguish not only between what is potential 
<A NAME="421"></A>and what is actual but also different senses in which things can be said 
<A NAME="422"></A>to be potential or actual; up to now we have been speaking as if each of 
<A NAME="423"></A>these phrases had only one sense. We can speak of something as 'a knower' 
<A NAME="424"></A>either (a) as when we say that man is a knower, meaning that man falls 
<A NAME="425"></A>within the class of beings that know or have knowledge, or (b) as when 
<A NAME="426"></A>we are speaking of a man who possesses a knowledge of grammar; each of 
<A NAME="427"></A>these is so called as having in him a certain potentiality, but there is 
<A NAME="428"></A>a difference between their respective potentialities, the one (a) being 
<A NAME="429"></A>a potential knower, because his kind or matter is such and such, the other 
<A NAME="430"></A>(b), because he can in the absence of any external counteracting cause 
<A NAME="431"></A>realize his knowledge in actual knowing at will. This implies a third meaning 
<A NAME="432"></A>of 'a knower' (c), one who is already realizing his knowledge-he is a knower 
<A NAME="433"></A>in actuality and in the most proper sense is knowing, e.g. this A. Both 
<A NAME="434"></A>the former are potential knowers, who realize their respective potentialities, 
<A NAME="435"></A>the one (a) by change of quality, i.e. repeated transitions from one state 
<A NAME="436"></A>to its opposite under instruction, the other (b) by the transition from 
<A NAME="437"></A>the inactive possession of sense or grammar to their active exercise. The 
<A NAME="438"></A>two kinds of transition are distinct.
<A NAME="439"></A><BR><BR>Also the expression 'to be acted upon' has more than one meaning; 
<A NAME="440"></A>it may mean either (a) the extinction of one of two contraries by the other, 
<A NAME="441"></A>or (b) the maintenance of what is potential by the agency of what is actual 
<A NAME="442"></A>and already like what is acted upon, with such likeness as is compatible 
<A NAME="443"></A>with one's being actual and the other potential. For what possesses knowledge 
<A NAME="444"></A>becomes an actual knower by a transition which is either not an alteration 
<A NAME="445"></A>of it at all (being in reality a development into its true self or actuality) 
<A NAME="446"></A>or at least an alteration in a quite different sense from the usual 
<A NAME="447"></A>meaning.
<A NAME="448"></A><BR><BR>Hence it is wrong to speak of a wise man as being 'altered' when 
<A NAME="449"></A>he uses his wisdom, just as it would be absurd to speak of a builder as 
<A NAME="450"></A>being altered when he is using his skill in building a 
<A NAME="451"></A>house.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>What in the case of knowing or understanding leads from potentiality 
<A NAME="453"></A>to actuality ought not to be called teaching but something else. That which 
<A NAME="454"></A>starting with the power to know learns or acquires knowledge through the 
<A NAME="455"></A>agency of one who actually knows and has the power of teaching either (a) 
<A NAME="456"></A>ought not to be said 'to be acted upon' at all or (b) we must recognize 
<A NAME="457"></A>two senses of alteration, viz. (i) the substitution of one quality for 
<A NAME="458"></A>another, the first being the contrary of the second, or (ii) the development 
<A NAME="459"></A>of an existent quality from potentiality in the direction of fixity or 
<A NAME="460"></A>nature.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>In the case of what is to possess sense, the first transition is 
<A NAME="462"></A>due to the action of the male parent and takes place before birth so that 
<A NAME="463"></A>at birth the living thing is, in respect of sensation, at the stage which 
<A NAME="464"></A>corresponds to the possession of knowledge. Actual sensation corresponds 
<A NAME="465"></A>to the stage of the exercise of knowledge. But between the two cases compared 
<A NAME="466"></A>there is a difference; the objects that excite the sensory powers to activity, 
<A NAME="467"></A>the seen, the heard, &c., are outside. The ground of this difference is 
<A NAME="468"></A>that what actual sensation apprehends is individuals, while what knowledge 
<A NAME="469"></A>apprehends is universals, and these are in a sense within the soul. That 
<A NAME="470"></A>is why a man can exercise his knowledge when he wishes, but his sensation 
<A NAME="471"></A>does not depend upon himself a sensible object must be there. A similar 
<A NAME="472"></A>statement must be made about our knowledge of what is sensible-on the same 
<A NAME="473"></A>ground, viz. that the sensible objects are individual and 
<A NAME="474"></A>external.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR>A later more appropriate occasion may be found thoroughly to clear 
<A NAME="476"></A>up all this. At present it must be enough to recognize the distinctions 
<A NAME="477"></A>already drawn; a thing may be said to be potential in either of two senses, 
<A NAME="478"></A>(a) in the sense in which we might say of a boy that he may become a general 
<A NAME="479"></A>or (b) in the sense in which we might say the same of an adult, and there 
<A NAME="480"></A>are two corresponding senses of the term 'a potential sentient'. There 
<A NAME="481"></A>are no separate names for the two stages of potentiality; we have pointed 
<A NAME="482"></A>out that they are different and how they are different. We cannot help 
<A NAME="483"></A>using the incorrect terms 'being acted upon or altered' of the two transitions 
<A NAME="484"></A>involved. As we have said, has the power of sensation is potentially like 
<A NAME="485"></A>what the perceived object is actually; that is, while at the beginning 
<A NAME="486"></A>of the process of its being acted upon the two interacting factors are 
<A NAME="487"></A>dissimilar, at the end the one acted upon is assimilated to the other and 
<A NAME="488"></A>is identical in quality with it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="489"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR>In dealing with each of the senses we shall have first to speak 
<A NAME="491"></A>of the objects which are perceptible by each. The term 'object of sense' 
<A NAME="492"></A>covers three kinds of objects, two kinds of which are, in our language, 
<A NAME="493"></A>directly perceptible, while the remaining one is only incidentally perceptible. 
<A NAME="494"></A>Of the first two kinds one (a) consists of what is perceptible by a single 
<A NAME="495"></A>sense, the other (b) of what is perceptible by any and all of the senses. 
<A NAME="496"></A>I call by the name of special object of this or that sense that which cannot 
<A NAME="497"></A>be perceived by any other sense than that one and in respect of which no 
<A NAME="498"></A>error is possible; in this sense colour is the special object of sight, 
<A NAME="499"></A>sound of hearing, flavour of taste. Touch, indeed, discriminates more than 
<A NAME="500"></A>one set of different qualities. Each sense has one kind of object which 
<A NAME="501"></A>it discerns, and never errs in reporting that what is before it is colour 
<A NAME="502"></A>or sound (though it may err as to what it is that is coloured or where 
<A NAME="503"></A>that is, or what it is that is sounding or where that is.) Such objects 
<A NAME="504"></A>are what we propose to call the special objects of this or that 
<A NAME="505"></A>sense.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>'Common sensibles' are movement, rest, number, figure, magnitude; 
<A NAME="507"></A>these are not peculiar to any one sense, but are common to all. There are 
<A NAME="508"></A>at any rate certain kinds of movement which are perceptible both by touch 
<A NAME="509"></A>and by sight.
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>We speak of an incidental object of sense where e.g. the white 
<A NAME="511"></A>object which we see is the son of Diares; here because 'being the son of 
<A NAME="512"></A>Diares' is incidental to the directly visible white patch we speak of the 
<A NAME="513"></A>son of Diares as being (incidentally) perceived or seen by us. Because 
<A NAME="514"></A>this is only incidentally an object of sense, it in no way as such affects 
<A NAME="515"></A>the senses. Of the two former kinds, both of which are in their own nature 
<A NAME="516"></A>perceptible by sense, the first kind-that of special objects of the several 
<A NAME="517"></A>senses-constitute the objects of sense in the strictest sense of the term 
<A NAME="518"></A>and it is to them that in the nature of things the structure of each several 
<A NAME="519"></A>sense is adapted.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="520"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>The object of sight is the visible, and what is visible is (a) 
<A NAME="522"></A>colour and (b) a certain kind of object which can be described in words 
<A NAME="523"></A>but which has no single name; what we mean by (b) will be abundantly clear 
<A NAME="524"></A>as we proceed. Whatever is visible is colour and colour is what lies upon 
<A NAME="525"></A>what is in its own nature visible; 'in its own nature' here means not that 
<A NAME="526"></A>visibility is involved in the definition of what thus underlies colour, 
<A NAME="527"></A>but that that substratum contains in itself the cause of visibility. Every 
<A NAME="528"></A>colour has in it the power to set in movement what is actually transparent; 
<A NAME="529"></A>that power constitutes its very nature. That is why it is not visible except 
<A NAME="530"></A>with the help of light; it is only in light that the colour of a thing 
<A NAME="531"></A>is seen. Hence our first task is to explain what light 
<A NAME="532"></A>is.
<A NAME="533"></A><BR><BR>Now there clearly is something which is transparent, and by 'transparent' 
<A NAME="534"></A>I mean what is visible, and yet not visible in itself, but rather owing 
<A NAME="535"></A>its visibility to the colour of something else; of this character are air, 
<A NAME="536"></A>water, and many solid bodies. Neither air nor water is transparent because 
<A NAME="537"></A>it is air or water; they are transparent because each of them has contained 
<A NAME="538"></A>in it a certain substance which is the same in both and is also found in 
<A NAME="539"></A>the eternal body which constitutes the uppermost shell of the physical 
<A NAME="540"></A>Cosmos. Of this substance light is the activity-the activity of what is 
<A NAME="541"></A>transparent so far forth as it has in it the determinate power of becoming 
<A NAME="542"></A>transparent; where this power is present, there is also the potentiality 
<A NAME="543"></A>of the contrary, viz. darkness. Light is as it were the proper colour of 
<A NAME="544"></A>what is transparent, and exists whenever the potentially transparent is 
<A NAME="545"></A>excited to actuality by the influence of fire or something resembling 'the 
<A NAME="546"></A>uppermost body'; for fire too contains something which is one and the same 
<A NAME="547"></A>with the substance in question.
<A NAME="548"></A><BR><BR>We have now explained what the transparent is and what light is; 
<A NAME="549"></A>light is neither fire nor any kind whatsoever of body nor an efflux from 
<A NAME="550"></A>any kind of body (if it were, it would again itself be a kind of body)-it 
<A NAME="551"></A>is the presence of fire or something resembling fire in what is transparent. 
<A NAME="552"></A>It is certainly not a body, for two bodies cannot be present in the same 
<A NAME="553"></A>place. The opposite of light is darkness; darkness is the absence from 
<A NAME="554"></A>what is transparent of the corresponding positive state above characterized; 
<A NAME="555"></A>clearly therefore, light is just the presence of that.
<A NAME="556"></A><BR><BR>Empedocles (and with him all others who used the same forms of 
<A NAME="557"></A>expression) was wrong in speaking of light as 'travelling' or being at 
<A NAME="558"></A>a given moment between the earth and its envelope, its movement being unobservable 
<A NAME="559"></A>by us; that view is contrary both to the clear evidence of argument and 
<A NAME="560"></A>to the observed facts; if the distance traversed were short, the movement 
<A NAME="561"></A>might have been unobservable, but where the distance is from extreme East 
<A NAME="562"></A>to extreme West, the draught upon our powers of belief is too 
<A NAME="563"></A>great.
<A NAME="564"></A><BR><BR>What is capable of taking on colour is what in itself is colourless, 
<A NAME="565"></A>as what can take on sound is what is soundless; what is colourless includes 
<A NAME="566"></A>(a) what is transparent and (b) what is invisible or scarcely visible, 
<A NAME="567"></A>i.e. what is 'dark'. The latter (b) is the same as what is transparent, 
<A NAME="568"></A>when it is potentially, not of course when it is actually transparent; 
<A NAME="569"></A>it is the same substance which is now darkness, now 
<A NAME="570"></A>light.
<A NAME="571"></A><BR><BR>Not everything that is visible depends upon light for its visibility. 
<A NAME="572"></A>This is only true of the 'proper' colour of things. Some objects of sight 
<A NAME="573"></A>which in light are invisible, in darkness stimulate the sense; that is, 
<A NAME="574"></A>things that appear fiery or shining. This class of objects has no simple 
<A NAME="575"></A>common name, but instances of it are fungi, flesh, heads, scales, and eyes 
<A NAME="576"></A>of fish. In none of these is what is seen their own proper' colour. Why 
<A NAME="577"></A>we see these at all is another question. At present what is obvious is 
<A NAME="578"></A>that what is seen in light is always colour. That is why without the help 
<A NAME="579"></A>of light colour remains invisible. Its being colour at all means precisely 
<A NAME="580"></A>its having in it the power to set in movement what is already actually 
<A NAME="581"></A>transparent, and, as we have seen, the actuality of what is transparent 
<A NAME="582"></A>is just light.
<A NAME="583"></A><BR><BR>The following experiment makes the necessity of a medium clear. 
<A NAME="584"></A>If what has colour is placed in immediate contact with the eye, it cannot 
<A NAME="585"></A>be seen. Colour sets in movement not the sense organ but what is transparent, 
<A NAME="586"></A>e.g. the air, and that, extending continuously from the object to the organ, 
<A NAME="587"></A>sets the latter in movement. Democritus misrepresents the facts when he 
<A NAME="588"></A>expresses the opinion that if the interspace were empty one could distinctly 
<A NAME="589"></A>see an ant on the vault of the sky; that is an impossibility. Seeing is 
<A NAME="590"></A>due to an affection or change of what has the perceptive faculty, and it 
<A NAME="591"></A>cannot be affected by the seen colour itself; it remains that it must be 
<A NAME="592"></A>affected by what comes between. Hence it is indispensable that there be 
<A NAME="593"></A>something in between-if there were nothing, so far from seeing with greater 
<A NAME="594"></A>distinctness, we should see nothing at all.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>We have now explained the cause why colour cannot be seen otherwise 
<A NAME="596"></A>than in light. Fire on the other hand is seen both in darkness and in light; 
<A NAME="597"></A>this double possibility follows necessarily from our theory, for it is 
<A NAME="598"></A>just fire that makes what is potentially transparent actually 
<A NAME="599"></A>transparent.
<A NAME="600"></A><BR><BR>The same account holds also of sound and smell; if the object of 
<A NAME="601"></A>either of these senses is in immediate contact with the organ no sensation 
<A NAME="602"></A>is produced. In both cases the object sets in movement only what lies between, 
<A NAME="603"></A>and this in turn sets the organ in movement: if what sounds or smells is 
<A NAME="604"></A>brought into immediate contact with the organ, no sensation will be produced. 
<A NAME="605"></A>The same, in spite of all appearances, applies also to touch and taste; 
<A NAME="606"></A>why there is this apparent difference will be clear later. What comes between 
<A NAME="607"></A>in the case of sounds is air; the corresponding medium in the case of smell 
<A NAME="608"></A>has no name. But, corresponding to what is transparent in the case of colour, 
<A NAME="609"></A>there is a quality found both in air and water, which serves as a medium 
<A NAME="610"></A>for what has smell-I say 'in water' because animals that live in water 
<A NAME="611"></A>as well as those that live on land seem to possess the sense of smell, 
<A NAME="612"></A>and 'in air' because man and all other land animals that breathe, perceive 
<A NAME="613"></A>smells only when they breathe air in. The explanation of this too will 
<A NAME="614"></A>be given later.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="615"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="616"></A><BR><BR>Now let us, to begin with, make certain distinctions about sound 
<A NAME="617"></A>and hearing.
<A NAME="618"></A><BR><BR>Sound may mean either of two things (a) actual, and (b) potential, 
<A NAME="619"></A>sound. There are certain things which, as we say, 'have no sound', e.g. 
<A NAME="620"></A>sponges or wool, others which have, e.g. bronze and in general all things 
<A NAME="621"></A>which are smooth and solid-the latter are said to have a sound because 
<A NAME="622"></A>they can make a sound, i.e. can generate actual sound between themselves 
<A NAME="623"></A>and the organ of hearing.
<A NAME="624"></A><BR><BR>Actual sound requires for its occurrence (i, ii) two such bodies 
<A NAME="625"></A>and (iii) a space between them; for it is generated by an impact. Hence 
<A NAME="626"></A>it is impossible for one body only to generate a sound-there must be a 
<A NAME="627"></A>body impinging and a body impinged upon; what sounds does so by striking 
<A NAME="628"></A>against something else, and this is impossible without a movement from 
<A NAME="629"></A>place to place.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>As we have said, not all bodies can by impact on one another produce 
<A NAME="631"></A>sound; impact on wool makes no sound, while the impact on bronze or any 
<A NAME="632"></A>body which is smooth and hollow does. Bronze gives out a sound when struck 
<A NAME="633"></A>because it is smooth; bodies which are hollow owing to reflection repeat 
<A NAME="634"></A>the original impact over and over again, the body originally set in movement 
<A NAME="635"></A>being unable to escape from the concavity.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>Further, we must remark that sound is heard both in air and in 
<A NAME="637"></A>water, though less distinctly in the latter. Yet neither air nor water 
<A NAME="638"></A>is the principal cause of sound. What is required for the production of 
<A NAME="639"></A>sound is an impact of two solids against one another and against the air. 
<A NAME="640"></A>The latter condition is satisfied when the air impinged upon does not retreat 
<A NAME="641"></A>before the blow, i.e. is not dissipated by it.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR><BR>That is why it must be struck with a sudden sharp blow, if it is 
<A NAME="643"></A>to sound-the movement of the whip must outrun the dispersion of the air, 
<A NAME="644"></A>just as one might get in a stroke at a heap or whirl of sand as it was 
<A NAME="645"></A>traveling rapidly past.
<A NAME="646"></A><BR><BR>An echo occurs, when, a mass of air having been unified, bounded, 
<A NAME="647"></A>and prevented from dissipation by the containing walls of a vessel, the 
<A NAME="648"></A>air originally struck by the impinging body and set in movement by it rebounds 
<A NAME="649"></A>from this mass of air like a ball from a wall. It is probable that in all 
<A NAME="650"></A>generation of sound echo takes place, though it is frequently only indistinctly 
<A NAME="651"></A>heard. What happens here must be analogous to what happens in the case 
<A NAME="652"></A>of light; light is always reflected-otherwise it would not be diffused 
<A NAME="653"></A>and outside what was directly illuminated by the sun there would be blank 
<A NAME="654"></A>darkness; but this reflected light is not always strong enough, as it is 
<A NAME="655"></A>when it is reflected from water, bronze, and other smooth bodies, to cast 
<A NAME="656"></A>a shadow, which is the distinguishing mark by which we recognize 
<A NAME="657"></A>light.
<A NAME="658"></A><BR><BR>It is rightly said that an empty space plays the chief part in 
<A NAME="659"></A>the production of hearing, for what people mean by 'the vacuum' is the 
<A NAME="660"></A>air, which is what causes hearing, when that air is set in movement as 
<A NAME="661"></A>one continuous mass; but owing to its friability it emits no sound, being 
<A NAME="662"></A>dissipated by impinging upon any surface which is not smooth. When the 
<A NAME="663"></A>surface on which it impinges is quite smooth, what is produced by the original 
<A NAME="664"></A>impact is a united mass, a result due to the smoothness of the surface 
<A NAME="665"></A>with which the air is in contact at the other end.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR>What has the power of producing sound is what has the power of 
<A NAME="667"></A>setting in movement a single mass of air which is continuous from the impinging 
<A NAME="668"></A>body up to the organ of hearing. The organ of hearing is physically united 
<A NAME="669"></A>with air, and because it is in air, the air inside is moved concurrently 
<A NAME="670"></A>with the air outside. Hence animals do not hear with all parts of their 
<A NAME="671"></A>bodies, nor do all parts admit of the entrance of air; for even the part 
<A NAME="672"></A>which can be moved and can sound has not air everywhere in it. Air in itself 
<A NAME="673"></A>is, owing to its friability, quite soundless; only when its dissipation 
<A NAME="674"></A>is prevented is its movement sound. The air in the ear is built into a 
<A NAME="675"></A>chamber just to prevent this dissipating movement, in order that the animal 
<A NAME="676"></A>may accurately apprehend all varieties of the movements of the air outside. 
<A NAME="677"></A>That is why we hear also in water, viz. because the water cannot get into 
<A NAME="678"></A>the air chamber or even, owing to the spirals, into the outer ear. If this 
<A NAME="679"></A>does happen, hearing ceases, as it also does if the tympanic membrane is 
<A NAME="680"></A>damaged, just as sight ceases if the membrane covering the pupil is damaged. 
<A NAME="681"></A>It is also a test of deafness whether the ear does or does not reverberate 
<A NAME="682"></A>like a horn; the air inside the ear has always a movement of its own, but 
<A NAME="683"></A>the sound we hear is always the sounding of something else, not of the 
<A NAME="684"></A>organ itself. That is why we say that we hear with what is empty and echoes, 
<A NAME="685"></A>viz. because what we hear with is a chamber which contains a bounded mass 
<A NAME="686"></A>of air.
<A NAME="687"></A><BR><BR>Which is it that 'sounds', the striking body or the struck? Is 
<A NAME="688"></A>not the answer 'it is both, but each in a different way'? Sound is a movement 
<A NAME="689"></A>of what can rebound from a smooth surface when struck against it. As we 
<A NAME="690"></A>have explained' not everything sounds when it strikes or is struck, e.g. 
<A NAME="691"></A>if one needle is struck against another, neither emits any sound. In order, 
<A NAME="692"></A>therefore, that sound may be generated, what is struck must be smooth, 
<A NAME="693"></A>to enable the air to rebound and be shaken off from it in one 
<A NAME="694"></A>piece.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>The distinctions between different sounding bodies show themselves 
<A NAME="696"></A>only in actual sound; as without the help of light colours remain invisible, 
<A NAME="697"></A>so without the help of actual sound the distinctions between acute and 
<A NAME="698"></A>grave sounds remain inaudible. Acute and grave are here metaphors, transferred 
<A NAME="699"></A>from their proper sphere, viz. that of touch, where they mean respectively 
<A NAME="700"></A>(a) what moves the sense much in a short time, (b) what moves the sense 
<A NAME="701"></A>little in a long time. Not that what is sharp really moves fast, and what 
<A NAME="702"></A>is grave, slowly, but that the difference in the qualities of the one and 
<A NAME="703"></A>the other movement is due to their respective speeds. There seems to be 
<A NAME="704"></A>a sort of parallelism between what is acute or grave to hearing and what 
<A NAME="705"></A>is sharp or blunt to touch; what is sharp as it were stabs, while what 
<A NAME="706"></A>is blunt pushes, the one producing its effect in a short, the other in 
<A NAME="707"></A>a long time, so that the one is quick, the other slow.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>Let the foregoing suffice as an analysis of sound. Voice is a kind 
<A NAME="709"></A>of sound characteristic of what has soul in it; nothing that is without 
<A NAME="710"></A>soul utters voice, it being only by a metaphor that we speak of the voice 
<A NAME="711"></A>of the flute or the lyre or generally of what (being without soul) possesses 
<A NAME="712"></A>the power of producing a succession of notes which differ in length and 
<A NAME="713"></A>pitch and timbre. The metaphor is based on the fact that all these differences 
<A NAME="714"></A>are found also in voice. Many animals are voiceless, e.g. all non-sanuineous 
<A NAME="715"></A>animals and among sanguineous animals fish. This is just what we should 
<A NAME="716"></A>expect, since voice is a certain movement of air. The fish, like those 
<A NAME="717"></A>in the Achelous, which are said to have voice, really make the sounds with 
<A NAME="718"></A>their gills or some similar organ. Voice is the sound made by an animal, 
<A NAME="719"></A>and that with a special organ. As we saw, everything that makes a sound 
<A NAME="720"></A>does so by the impact of something (a) against something else, (b) across 
<A NAME="721"></A>a space, (c) filled with air; hence it is only to be expected that no animals 
<A NAME="722"></A>utter voice except those which take in air. Once air is inbreathed, Nature 
<A NAME="723"></A>uses it for two different purposes, as the tongue is used both for tasting 
<A NAME="724"></A>and for articulating; in that case of the two functions tasting is necessary 
<A NAME="725"></A>for the animal's existence (hence it is found more widely distributed), 
<A NAME="726"></A>while articulate speech is a luxury subserving its possessor's well-being; 
<A NAME="727"></A>similarly in the former case Nature employs the breath both as an indispensable 
<A NAME="728"></A>means to the regulation of the inner temperature of the living body and 
<A NAME="729"></A>also as the matter of articulate voice, in the interests of its possessor's 
<A NAME="730"></A>well-being. Why its former use is indispensable must be discussed 
<A NAME="731"></A>elsewhere.
<A NAME="732"></A><BR><BR>The organ of respiration is the windpipe, and the organ to which 
<A NAME="733"></A>this is related as means to end is the lungs. The latter is the part of 
<A NAME="734"></A>the body by which the temperature of land animals is raised above that 
<A NAME="735"></A>of all others. But what primarily requires the air drawn in by respiration 
<A NAME="736"></A>is not only this but the region surrounding the heart. That is why when 
<A NAME="737"></A>animals breathe the air must penetrate inwards.
<A NAME="738"></A><BR><BR>Voice then is the impact of the inbreathed air against the 'windpipe', 
<A NAME="739"></A>and the agent that produces the impact is the soul resident in these parts 
<A NAME="740"></A>of the body. Not every sound, as we said, made by an animal is voice (even 
<A NAME="741"></A>with the tongue we may merely make a sound which is not voice, or without 
<A NAME="742"></A>the tongue as in coughing); what produces the impact must have soul in 
<A NAME="743"></A>it and must be accompanied by an act of imagination, for voice is a sound 
<A NAME="744"></A>with a meaning, and is not merely the result of any impact of the breath 
<A NAME="745"></A>as in coughing; in voice the breath in the windpipe is used as an instrument 
<A NAME="746"></A>to knock with against the walls of the windpipe. This is confirmed by our 
<A NAME="747"></A>inability to speak when we are breathing either out or in-we can only do 
<A NAME="748"></A>so by holding our breath; we make the movements with the breath so checked. 
<A NAME="749"></A>It is clear also why fish are voiceless; they have no windpipe. And they 
<A NAME="750"></A>have no windpipe because they do not breathe or take in air. Why they do 
<A NAME="751"></A>not is a question belonging to another inquiry.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="752"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="753"></A><BR><BR>Smell and its object are much less easy to determine than what 
<A NAME="754"></A>we have hitherto discussed; the distinguishing characteristic of the object 
<A NAME="755"></A>of smell is less obvious than those of sound or colour. The ground of this 
<A NAME="756"></A>is that our power of smell is less discriminating and in general inferior 
<A NAME="757"></A>to that of many species of animals; men have a poor sense of smell and 
<A NAME="758"></A>our apprehension of its proper objects is inseparably bound up with and 
<A NAME="759"></A>so confused by pleasure and pain, which shows that in us the organ is inaccurate. 
<A NAME="760"></A>It is probable that there is a parallel failure in the perception of colour 
<A NAME="761"></A>by animals that have hard eyes: probably they discriminate differences 
<A NAME="762"></A>of colour only by the presence or absence of what excites fear, and that 
<A NAME="763"></A>it is thus that human beings distinguish smells. It seems that there is 
<A NAME="764"></A>an analogy between smell and taste, and that the species of tastes run 
<A NAME="765"></A>parallel to those of smells-the only difference being that our sense of 
<A NAME="766"></A>taste is more discriminating than our sense of smell, because the former 
<A NAME="767"></A>is a modification of touch, which reaches in man the maximum of discriminative 
<A NAME="768"></A>accuracy. While in respect of all the other senses we fall below many species 
<A NAME="769"></A>of animals, in respect of touch we far excel all other species in exactness 
<A NAME="770"></A>of discrimination. That is why man is the most intelligent of all animals. 
<A NAME="771"></A>This is confirmed by the fact that it is to differences in the organ of 
<A NAME="772"></A>touch and to nothing else that the differences between man and man in respect 
<A NAME="773"></A>of natural endowment are due; men whose flesh is hard are ill-endowed by 
<A NAME="774"></A>nature, men whose flesh is soft, wellendowed.
<A NAME="775"></A><BR><BR>As flavours may be divided into (a) sweet, (b) bitter, so with 
<A NAME="776"></A>smells. In some things the flavour and the smell have the same quality, 
<A NAME="777"></A>i.e. both are sweet or both bitter, in others they diverge. Similarly a 
<A NAME="778"></A>smell, like a flavour, may be pungent, astringent, acid, or succulent. 
<A NAME="779"></A>But, as we said, because smells are much less easy to discriminate than 
<A NAME="780"></A>flavours, the names of these varieties are applied to smells only metaphorically; 
<A NAME="781"></A>for example 'sweet' is extended from the taste to the smell of saffron 
<A NAME="782"></A>or honey, 'pungent' to that of thyme, and so on.
<A NAME="783"></A><BR><BR>In the same sense in which hearing has for its object both the 
<A NAME="784"></A>audible and the inaudible, sight both the visible and the invisible, smell 
<A NAME="785"></A>has for its object both the odorous and the inodorous. 'Inodorous' may 
<A NAME="786"></A>be either (a) what has no smell at all, or (b) what has a small or feeble 
<A NAME="787"></A>smell. The same ambiguity lurks in the word 'tasteless'.
<A NAME="788"></A><BR><BR>Smelling, like the operation of the senses previously examined, 
<A NAME="789"></A>takes place through a medium, i.e. through air or water-I add water, because 
<A NAME="790"></A>water-animals too (both sanguineous and non-sanguineous) seem to smell 
<A NAME="791"></A>just as much as land-animals; at any rate some of them make directly for 
<A NAME="792"></A>their food from a distance if it has any scent. That is why the following 
<A NAME="793"></A>facts constitute a problem for us. All animals smell in the same way, but 
<A NAME="794"></A>man smells only when he inhales; if he exhales or holds his breath, he 
<A NAME="795"></A>ceases to smell, no difference being made whether the odorous object is 
<A NAME="796"></A>distant or near, or even placed inside the nose and actually on the wall 
<A NAME="797"></A>of the nostril; it is a disability common to all the senses not to perceive 
<A NAME="798"></A>what is in immediate contact with the organ of sense, but our failure to 
<A NAME="799"></A>apprehend what is odorous without the help of inhalation is peculiar (the 
<A NAME="800"></A>fact is obvious on making the experiment). Now since bloodless animals 
<A NAME="801"></A>do not breathe, they must, it might be argued, have some novel sense not 
<A NAME="802"></A>reckoned among the usual five. Our reply must be that this is impossible, 
<A NAME="803"></A>since it is scent that is perceived; a sense that apprehends what is odorous 
<A NAME="804"></A>and what has a good or bad odour cannot be anything but smell. Further, 
<A NAME="805"></A>they are observed to be deleteriously effected by the same strong odours 
<A NAME="806"></A>as man is, e.g. bitumen, sulphur, and the like. These animals must be able 
<A NAME="807"></A>to smell without being able to breathe. The probable explanation is that 
<A NAME="808"></A>in man the organ of smell has a certain superiority over that in all other 
<A NAME="809"></A>animals just as his eyes have over those of hard-eyed animals. Man's eyes 
<A NAME="810"></A>have in the eyelids a kind of shelter or envelope, which must be shifted 
<A NAME="811"></A>or drawn back in order that we may see, while hardeyed animals have nothing 
<A NAME="812"></A>of the kind, but at once see whatever presents itself in the transparent 
<A NAME="813"></A>medium. Similarly in certain species of animals the organ of smell is like 
<A NAME="814"></A>the eye of hard-eyed animals, uncurtained, while in others which take in 
<A NAME="815"></A>air it probably has a curtain over it, which is drawn back in inhalation, 
<A NAME="816"></A>owing to the dilating of the veins or pores. That explains also why such 
<A NAME="817"></A>animals cannot smell under water; to smell they must first inhale, and 
<A NAME="818"></A>that they cannot do under water.
<A NAME="819"></A><BR><BR>Smells come from what is dry as flavours from what is moist. Consequently 
<A NAME="820"></A>the organ of smell is potentially dry.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="821"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR>What can be tasted is always something that can be touched, and 
<A NAME="823"></A>just for that reason it cannot be perceived through an interposed foreign 
<A NAME="824"></A>body, for touch means the absence of any intervening body. Further, the 
<A NAME="825"></A>flavoured and tasteable body is suspended in a liquid matter, and this 
<A NAME="826"></A>is tangible. Hence, if we lived in water, we should perceive a sweet object 
<A NAME="827"></A>introduced into the water, but the water would not be the medium through 
<A NAME="828"></A>which we perceived; our perception would be due to the solution of the 
<A NAME="829"></A>sweet substance in what we imbibed, just as if it were mixed with some 
<A NAME="830"></A>drink. There is no parallel here to the perception of colour, which is 
<A NAME="831"></A>due neither to any blending of anything with anything, nor to any efflux 
<A NAME="832"></A>of anything from anything. In the case of taste, there is nothing corresponding 
<A NAME="833"></A>to the medium in the case of the senses previously discussed; but as the 
<A NAME="834"></A>object of sight is colour, so the object of taste is flavour. But nothing 
<A NAME="835"></A>excites a perception of flavour without the help of liquid; what acts upon 
<A NAME="836"></A>the sense of taste must be either actually or potentially liquid like what 
<A NAME="837"></A>is saline; it must be both (a) itself easily dissolved, and (b) capable 
<A NAME="838"></A>of dissolving along with itself the tongue. Taste apprehends both (a) what 
<A NAME="839"></A>has taste and (b) what has no taste, if we mean by (b) what has only a 
<A NAME="840"></A>slight or feeble flavour or what tends to destroy the sense of taste. In 
<A NAME="841"></A>this it is exactly parallel to sight, which apprehends both what is visible 
<A NAME="842"></A>and what is invisible (for darkness is invisible and yet is discriminated 
<A NAME="843"></A>by sight; so is, in a different way, what is over brilliant), and to hearing, 
<A NAME="844"></A>which apprehends both sound and silence, of which the one is audible and 
<A NAME="845"></A>the other inaudible, and also over-loud sound. This corresponds in the 
<A NAME="846"></A>case of hearing to over-bright light in the case of sight. As a faint sound 
<A NAME="847"></A>is 'inaudible', so in a sense is a loud or violent sound. The word 'invisible' 
<A NAME="848"></A>and similar privative terms cover not only (a) what is simply without some 
<A NAME="849"></A>power, but also (b) what is adapted by nature to have it but has not it 
<A NAME="850"></A>or has it only in a very low degree, as when we say that a species of swallow 
<A NAME="851"></A>is 'footless' or that a variety of fruit is 'stoneless'. So too taste has 
<A NAME="852"></A>as its object both what can be tasted and the tasteless-the latter in the 
<A NAME="853"></A>sense of what has little flavour or a bad flavour or one destructive of 
<A NAME="854"></A>taste. The difference between what is tasteless and what is not seems to 
<A NAME="855"></A>rest ultimately on that between what is drinkable and what is undrinkable 
<A NAME="856"></A>both are tasteable, but the latter is bad and tends to destroy taste, while 
<A NAME="857"></A>the former is the normal stimulus of taste. What is drinkable is the common 
<A NAME="858"></A>object of both touch and taste.
<A NAME="859"></A><BR><BR>Since what can be tasted is liquid, the organ for its perception 
<A NAME="860"></A>cannot be either (a) actually liquid or (b) incapable of becoming liquid. 
<A NAME="861"></A>Tasting means a being affected by what can be tasted as such; hence the 
<A NAME="862"></A>organ of taste must be liquefied, and so to start with must be non-liquid 
<A NAME="863"></A>but capable of liquefaction without loss of its distinctive nature. This 
<A NAME="864"></A>is confirmed by the fact that the tongue cannot taste either when it is 
<A NAME="865"></A>too dry or when it is too moist; in the latter case what occurs is due 
<A NAME="866"></A>to a contact with the pre-existent moisture in the tongue itself, when 
<A NAME="867"></A>after a foretaste of some strong flavour we try to taste another flavour; 
<A NAME="868"></A>it is in this way that sick persons find everything they taste bitter, 
<A NAME="869"></A>viz. because, when they taste, their tongues are overflowing with bitter 
<A NAME="870"></A>moisture.
<A NAME="871"></A><BR><BR>The species of flavour are, as in the case of colour, (a) simple, 
<A NAME="872"></A>i.e. the two contraries, the sweet and the bitter, (b) secondary, viz. 
<A NAME="873"></A>(i) on the side of the sweet, the succulent, (ii) on the side of the bitter, 
<A NAME="874"></A>the saline, (iii) between these come the pungent, the harsh, the astringent, 
<A NAME="875"></A>and the acid; these pretty well exhaust the varieties of flavour. It follows 
<A NAME="876"></A>that what has the power of tasting is what is potentially of that kind, 
<A NAME="877"></A>and that what is tasteable is what has the power of making it actually 
<A NAME="878"></A>what it itself already is.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="879"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="880"></A><BR><BR>Whatever can be said of what is tangible, can be said of touch, 
<A NAME="881"></A>and vice versa; if touch is not a single sense but a group of senses, there 
<A NAME="882"></A>must be several kinds of what is tangible. It is a problem whether touch 
<A NAME="883"></A>is a single sense or a group of senses. It is also a problem, what is the 
<A NAME="884"></A>organ of touch; is it or is it not the flesh (including what in certain 
<A NAME="885"></A>animals is homologous with flesh)? On the second view, flesh is 'the medium' 
<A NAME="886"></A>of touch, the real organ being situated farther inward. The problem arises 
<A NAME="887"></A>because the field of each sense is according to the accepted view determined 
<A NAME="888"></A>as the range between a single pair of contraries, white and black for sight, 
<A NAME="889"></A>acute and grave for hearing, bitter and sweet for taste; but in the field 
<A NAME="890"></A>of what is tangible we find several such pairs, hot cold, dry moist, hard 
<A NAME="891"></A>soft, &c. This problem finds a partial solution, when it is recalled that 
<A NAME="892"></A>in the case of the other senses more than one pair of contraries are to 
<A NAME="893"></A>be met with, e.g. in sound not only acute and grave but loud and soft, 
<A NAME="894"></A>smooth and rough, &c.; there are similar contrasts in the field of colour. 
<A NAME="895"></A>Nevertheless we are unable clearly to detect in the case of touch what 
<A NAME="896"></A>the single subject is which underlies the contrasted qualities and corresponds 
<A NAME="897"></A>to sound in the case of hearing.
<A NAME="898"></A><BR><BR>To the question whether the organ of touch lies inward or not (i.e. 
<A NAME="899"></A>whether we need look any farther than the flesh), no indication in favour 
<A NAME="900"></A>of the second answer can be drawn from the fact that if the object comes 
<A NAME="901"></A>into contact with the flesh it is at once perceived. For even under present 
<A NAME="902"></A>conditions if the experiment is made of making a web and stretching it 
<A NAME="903"></A>tight over the flesh, as soon as this web is touched the sensation is reported 
<A NAME="904"></A>in the same manner as before, yet it is clear that the or is gan is not 
<A NAME="905"></A>in this membrane. If the membrane could be grown on to the flesh, the report 
<A NAME="906"></A>would travel still quicker. The flesh plays in touch very much the same 
<A NAME="907"></A>part as would be played in the other senses by an air-envelope growing 
<A NAME="908"></A>round our body; had we such an envelope attached to us we should have supposed 
<A NAME="909"></A>that it was by a single organ that we perceived sounds, colours, and smells, 
<A NAME="910"></A>and we should have taken sight, hearing, and smell to be a single sense. 
<A NAME="911"></A>But as it is, because that through which the different movements are transmitted 
<A NAME="912"></A>is not naturally attached to our bodies, the difference of the various 
<A NAME="913"></A>sense-organs is too plain to miss. But in the case of touch the obscurity 
<A NAME="914"></A>remains.
<A NAME="915"></A><BR><BR>There must be such a naturally attached 'medium' as flesh, for 
<A NAME="916"></A>no living body could be constructed of air or water; it must be something 
<A NAME="917"></A>solid. Consequently it must be composed of earth along with these, which 
<A NAME="918"></A>is just what flesh and its analogue in animals which have no true flesh 
<A NAME="919"></A>tend to be. Hence of necessity the medium through which are transmitted 
<A NAME="920"></A>the manifoldly contrasted tactual qualities must be a body naturally attached 
<A NAME="921"></A>to the organism. That they are manifold is clear when we consider touching 
<A NAME="922"></A>with the tongue; we apprehend at the tongue all tangible qualities as well 
<A NAME="923"></A>as flavour. Suppose all the rest of our flesh was, like the tongue, sensitive 
<A NAME="924"></A>to flavour, we should have identified the sense of taste and the sense 
<A NAME="925"></A>of touch; what saves us from this identification is the fact that touch 
<A NAME="926"></A>and taste are not always found together in the same part of the body. The 
<A NAME="927"></A>following problem might be raised. Let us assume that every body has depth, 
<A NAME="928"></A>i.e. has three dimensions, and that if two bodies have a third body between 
<A NAME="929"></A>them they cannot be in contact with one another; let us remember that what 
<A NAME="930"></A>is liquid is a body and must be or contain water, and that if two bodies 
<A NAME="931"></A>touch one another under water, their touching surfaces cannot be dry, but 
<A NAME="932"></A>must have water between, viz. the water which wets their bounding surfaces; 
<A NAME="933"></A>from all this it follows that in water two bodies cannot be in contact 
<A NAME="934"></A>with one another. The same holds of two bodies in air-air being to bodies 
<A NAME="935"></A>in air precisely what water is to bodies in water-but the facts are not 
<A NAME="936"></A>so evident to our observation, because we live in air, just as animals 
<A NAME="937"></A>that live in water would not notice that the things which touch one another 
<A NAME="938"></A>in water have wet surfaces. The problem, then, is: does the perception 
<A NAME="939"></A>of all objects of sense take place in the same way, or does it not, e.g. 
<A NAME="940"></A>taste and touch requiring contact (as they are commonly thought to do), 
<A NAME="941"></A>while all other senses perceive over a distance? The distinction is unsound; 
<A NAME="942"></A>we perceive what is hard or soft, as well as the objects of hearing, sight, 
<A NAME="943"></A>and smell, through a 'medium', only that the latter are perceived over 
<A NAME="944"></A>a greater distance than the former; that is why the facts escape our notice. 
<A NAME="945"></A>For we do perceive everything through a medium; but in these cases the 
<A NAME="946"></A>fact escapes us. Yet, to repeat what we said before, if the medium for 
<A NAME="947"></A>touch were a membrane separating us from the object without our observing 
<A NAME="948"></A>its existence, we should be relatively to it in the same condition as we 
<A NAME="949"></A>are now to air or water in which we are immersed; in their case we fancy 
<A NAME="950"></A>we can touch objects, nothing coming in between us and them. But there 
<A NAME="951"></A>remains this difference between what can be touched and what can be seen 
<A NAME="952"></A>or can sound; in the latter two cases we perceive because the medium produces 
<A NAME="953"></A>a certain effect upon us, whereas in the perception of objects of touch 
<A NAME="954"></A>we are affected not by but along with the medium; it is as if a man were 
<A NAME="955"></A>struck through his shield, where the shock is not first given to the shield 
<A NAME="956"></A>and passed on to the man, but the concussion of both is 
<A NAME="957"></A>simultaneous.
<A NAME="958"></A><BR><BR>In general, flesh and the tongue are related to the real organs 
<A NAME="959"></A>of touch and taste, as air and water are to those of sight, hearing, and 
<A NAME="960"></A>smell. Hence in neither the one case nor the other can there be any perception 
<A NAME="961"></A>of an object if it is placed immediately upon the organ, e.g. if a white 
<A NAME="962"></A>object is placed on the surface of the eye. This again shows that what 
<A NAME="963"></A>has the power of perceiving the tangible is seated inside. Only so would 
<A NAME="964"></A>there be a complete analogy with all the other senses. In their case if 
<A NAME="965"></A>you place the object on the organ it is not perceived, here if you place 
<A NAME="966"></A>it on the flesh it is perceived; therefore flesh is not the organ but the 
<A NAME="967"></A>medium of touch.
<A NAME="968"></A><BR><BR>What can be touched are distinctive qualities of body as body; 
<A NAME="969"></A>by such differences I mean those which characterize the elements, viz, 
<A NAME="970"></A>hot cold, dry moist, of which we have spoken earlier in our treatise on 
<A NAME="971"></A>the elements. The organ for the perception of these is that of touch-that 
<A NAME="972"></A>part of the body in which primarily the sense of touch resides. This is 
<A NAME="973"></A>that part which is potentially such as its object is actually: for all 
<A NAME="974"></A>sense-perception is a process of being so affected; so that that which 
<A NAME="975"></A>makes something such as it itself actually is makes the other such because 
<A NAME="976"></A>the other is already potentially such. That is why when an object of touch 
<A NAME="977"></A>is equally hot and cold or hard and soft we cannot perceive; what we perceive 
<A NAME="978"></A>must have a degree of the sensible quality lying beyond the neutral point. 
<A NAME="979"></A>This implies that the sense itself is a 'mean' between any two opposite 
<A NAME="980"></A>qualities which determine the field of that sense. It is to this that it 
<A NAME="981"></A>owes its power of discerning the objects in that field. What is 'in the 
<A NAME="982"></A>middle' is fitted to discern; relatively to either extreme it can put itself 
<A NAME="983"></A>in the place of the other. As what is to perceive both white and black 
<A NAME="984"></A>must, to begin with, be actually neither but potentially either (and so 
<A NAME="985"></A>with all the other sense-organs), so the organ of touch must be neither 
<A NAME="986"></A>hot nor cold.
<A NAME="987"></A><BR><BR>Further, as in a sense sight had for its object both what was visible 
<A NAME="988"></A>and what was invisible (and there was a parallel truth about all the other 
<A NAME="989"></A>senses discussed), so touch has for its object both what is tangible and 
<A NAME="990"></A>what is intangible. Here by 'intangible' is meant (a) what like air possesses 
<A NAME="991"></A>some quality of tangible things in a very slight degree and (b) what possesses 
<A NAME="992"></A>it in an excessive degree, as destructive things do.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR><BR>We have now given an outline account of each of the several 
<A NAME="994"></A>senses.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="995"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="996"></A><BR><BR>The following results applying to any and every sense may now be 
<A NAME="997"></A>formulated.
<A NAME="998"></A><BR><BR>(A) By a 'sense' is meant what has the power of receiving into 
<A NAME="999"></A>itself the sensible forms of things without the matter. This must be conceived 
<A NAME="1000"></A>of as taking place in the way in which a piece of wax takes on the impress 
<A NAME="1001"></A>of a signet-ring without the iron or gold; we say that what produces the 
<A NAME="1002"></A>impression is a signet of bronze or gold, but its particular metallic constitution 
<A NAME="1003"></A>makes no difference: in a similar way the sense is affected by what is 
<A NAME="1004"></A>coloured or flavoured or sounding, but it is indifferent what in each case 
<A NAME="1005"></A>the substance is; what alone matters is what quality it has, i.e. in what 
<A NAME="1006"></A>ratio its constituents are combined.
<A NAME="1007"></A><BR><BR>(B) By 'an organ of sense' is meant that in which ultimately such 
<A NAME="1008"></A>a power is seated.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR>The sense and its organ are the same in fact, but their essence 
<A NAME="1010"></A>is not the same. What perceives is, of course, a spatial magnitude, but 
<A NAME="1011"></A>we must not admit that either the having the power to perceive or the sense 
<A NAME="1012"></A>itself is a magnitude; what they are is a certain ratio or power in a magnitude. 
<A NAME="1013"></A>This enables us to explain why objects of sense which possess one of two 
<A NAME="1014"></A>opposite sensible qualities in a degree largely in excess of the other 
<A NAME="1015"></A>opposite destroy the organs of sense; if the movement set up by an object 
<A NAME="1016"></A>is too strong for the organ, the equipoise of contrary qualities in the 
<A NAME="1017"></A>organ, which just is its sensory power, is disturbed; it is precisely as 
<A NAME="1018"></A>concord and tone are destroyed by too violently twanging the strings of 
<A NAME="1019"></A>a lyre. This explains also why plants cannot perceive. in spite of their 
<A NAME="1020"></A>having a portion of soul in them and obviously being affected by tangible 
<A NAME="1021"></A>objects themselves; for undoubtedly their temperature can be lowered or 
<A NAME="1022"></A>raised. The explanation is that they have no mean of contrary qualities, 
<A NAME="1023"></A>and so no principle in them capable of taking on the forms of sensible 
<A NAME="1024"></A>objects without their matter; in the case of plants the affection is an 
<A NAME="1025"></A>affection by form-and-matter together. The problem might be raised: Can 
<A NAME="1026"></A>what cannot smell be said to be affected by smells or what cannot see by 
<A NAME="1027"></A>colours, and so on? It might be said that a smell is just what can be smelt, 
<A NAME="1028"></A>and if it produces any effect it can only be so as to make something smell 
<A NAME="1029"></A>it, and it might be argued that what cannot smell cannot be affected by 
<A NAME="1030"></A>smells and further that what can smell can be affected by it only in so 
<A NAME="1031"></A>far as it has in it the power to smell (similarly with the proper objects 
<A NAME="1032"></A>of all the other senses). Indeed that this is so is made quite evident 
<A NAME="1033"></A>as follows. Light or darkness, sounds and smells leave bodies quite unaffected; 
<A NAME="1034"></A>what does affect bodies is not these but the bodies which are their vehicles, 
<A NAME="1035"></A>e.g. what splits the trunk of a tree is not the sound of the thunder but 
<A NAME="1036"></A>the air which accompanies thunder. Yes, but, it may be objected, bodies 
<A NAME="1037"></A>are affected by what is tangible and by flavours. If not, by what are things 
<A NAME="1038"></A>that are without soul affected, i.e. altered in quality? Must we not, then, 
<A NAME="1039"></A>admit that the objects of the other senses also may affect them? Is not 
<A NAME="1040"></A>the true account this, that all bodies are capable of being affected by 
<A NAME="1041"></A>smells and sounds, but that some on being acted upon, having no boundaries 
<A NAME="1042"></A>of their own, disintegrate, as in the instance of air, which does become 
<A NAME="1043"></A>odorous, showing that some effect is produced on it by what is odorous? 
<A NAME="1044"></A>But smelling is more than such an affection by what is odorous-what more? 
<A NAME="1045"></A>Is not the answer that, while the air owing to the momentary duration of 
<A NAME="1046"></A>the action upon it of what is odorous does itself become perceptible to 
<A NAME="1047"></A>the sense of smell, smelling is an observing of the result 
<A NAME="1048"></A>produced?
