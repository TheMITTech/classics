<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Everything that is in motion must be moved by something. For if it has 
<A NAME="12"></A>not the source of its motion in itself it is evident that it is moved by 
<A NAME="13"></A>something other than itself, for there must be something else that moves 
<A NAME="14"></A>it. If on the other hand it has the source of its motion in itself, let 
<A NAME="15"></A>AB be taken to represent that which is in motion essentially of itself 
<A NAME="16"></A>and not in virtue of the fact that something belonging to it is in motion. 
<A NAME="17"></A>Now in the first place to assume that Ab, because it is in motion as a 
<A NAME="18"></A>whole and is not moved by anything external to itself, is therefore moved 
<A NAME="19"></A>by itself-this is just as if, supposing that KL is moving LM and is also 
<A NAME="20"></A>itself in motion, we were to deny that KM is moved by anything on the ground 
<A NAME="21"></A>that it is not evident which is the part that is moving it and which the 
<A NAME="22"></A>part that is moved. In the second place that which is in motion without 
<A NAME="23"></A>being moved by anything does not necessarily cease from its motion because 
<A NAME="24"></A>something else is at rest, but a thing must be moved by something if the 
<A NAME="25"></A>fact of something else having ceased from its motion causes it to be at 
<A NAME="26"></A>rest. Thus, if this is accepted, everything that is in motion must be moved 
<A NAME="27"></A>by something. For AB, which has been taken to represent that which is in 
<A NAME="28"></A>motion, must be divisible since everything that is in motion is divisible. 
<A NAME="29"></A>Let it be divided, then, at G. Now if GB is not in motion, then AB will 
<A NAME="30"></A>not be in motion: for if it is, it is clear that AG would be in motion 
<A NAME="31"></A>while BG is at rest, and thus AB cannot be in motion essentially and primarily. 
<A NAME="32"></A>But ex hypothesi AB is in motion essentially and primarily. Therefore if 
<A NAME="33"></A>GB is not in motion AB will be at rest. But we have agreed that that which 
<A NAME="34"></A>is at rest if something else is not in motion must be moved by something. 
<A NAME="35"></A>Consequently, everything that is in motion must be moved by something: 
<A NAME="36"></A>for that which is in motion will always be divisible, and if a part of 
<A NAME="37"></A>it is not in motion the whole must be at rest.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>Since everything that is in motion must be moved by something, 
<A NAME="39"></A>let us take the case in which a thing is in locomotion and is moved by 
<A NAME="40"></A>something that is itself in motion, and that again is moved by something 
<A NAME="41"></A>else that is in motion, and that by something else, and so on continually: 
<A NAME="42"></A>then the series cannot go on to infinity, but there must be some first 
<A NAME="43"></A>movent. For let us suppose that this is not so and take the series to be 
<A NAME="44"></A>infinite. Let A then be moved by B, B by G, G by D, and so on, each member 
<A NAME="45"></A>of the series being moved by that which comes next to it. Then since ex 
<A NAME="46"></A>hypothesi the movent while causing motion is also itself in motion, and 
<A NAME="47"></A>the motion of the moved and the motion of the movent must proceed simultaneously 
<A NAME="48"></A>(for the movent is causing motion and the moved is being moved simultaneously) 
<A NAME="49"></A>it is evident that the respective motions of A, B, G, and each of the other 
<A NAME="50"></A>moved movents are simultaneous. Let us take the motion of each separately 
<A NAME="51"></A>and let E be the motion of A, Z of B, and H and O respectively the motions 
<A NAME="52"></A>of G and D: for though they are all moved severally one by another, yet 
<A NAME="53"></A>we may still take the motion of each as numerically one, since every motion 
<A NAME="54"></A>is from something to something and is not infinite in respect of its extreme 
<A NAME="55"></A>points. By a motion that is numerically one I mean a motion that proceeds 
<A NAME="56"></A>from something numerically one and the same to something numerically one 
<A NAME="57"></A>and the same in a period of time numerically one and the same: for a motion 
<A NAME="58"></A>may be the same generically, specifically, or numerically: it is generically 
<A NAME="59"></A>the same if it belongs to the same category, e.g. substance or quality: 
<A NAME="60"></A>it is specifically the same if it proceeds from something specifically 
<A NAME="61"></A>the same to something specifically the same, e.g. from white to black or 
<A NAME="62"></A>from good to bad, which is not of a kind specifically distinct: it is numerically 
<A NAME="63"></A>the same if it proceeds from something numerically one to something numerically 
<A NAME="64"></A>one in the same period of time, e.g. from a particular white to a particular 
<A NAME="65"></A>black, or from a particular place to a particular place, in a particular 
<A NAME="66"></A>period of time: for if the period of time were not one and the same, the 
<A NAME="67"></A>motion would no longer be numerically one though it would still be specifically 
<A NAME="68"></A>one.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>We have dealt with this question above. Now let us further take 
<A NAME="70"></A>the time in which A has completed its motion, and let it be represented 
<A NAME="71"></A>by K. Then since the motion of A is finite the time will also be finite. 
<A NAME="72"></A>But since the movents and the things moved are infinite, the motion EZHO, 
<A NAME="73"></A>i.e. the motion that is composed of all the individual motions, must be 
<A NAME="74"></A>infinite. For the motions of A, B, and the others may be equal, or the 
<A NAME="75"></A>motions of the others may be greater: but assuming what is conceivable, 
<A NAME="76"></A>we find that whether they are equal or some are greater, in both cases 
<A NAME="77"></A>the whole motion is infinite. And since the motion of A and that of each 
<A NAME="78"></A>of the others are simultaneous, the whole motion must occupy the same time 
<A NAME="79"></A>as the motion of A: but the time occupied by the motion of A is finite: 
<A NAME="80"></A>consequently the motion will be infinite in a finite time, which is 
<A NAME="81"></A>impossible.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>It might be thought that what we set out to prove has thus been 
<A NAME="83"></A>shown, but our argument so far does not prove it, because it does not yet 
<A NAME="84"></A>prove that anything impossible results from the contrary supposition: for 
<A NAME="85"></A>in a finite time there may be an infinite motion, though not of one thing, 
<A NAME="86"></A>but of many: and in the case that we are considering this is so: for each 
<A NAME="87"></A>thing accomplishes its own motion, and there is no impossibility in many 
<A NAME="88"></A>things being in motion simultaneously. But if (as we see to be universally 
<A NAME="89"></A>the case) that which primarily is moved locally and corporeally must be 
<A NAME="90"></A>either in contact with or continuous with that which moves it, the things 
<A NAME="91"></A>moved and the movents must be continuous or in contact with one another, 
<A NAME="92"></A>so that together they all form a single unity: whether this unity is finite 
<A NAME="93"></A>or infinite makes no difference to our present argument; for in any case 
<A NAME="94"></A>since the things in motion are infinite in number the whole motion will 
<A NAME="95"></A>be infinite, if, as is theoretically possible, each motion is either equal 
<A NAME="96"></A>to or greater than that which follows it in the series: for we shall take 
<A NAME="97"></A>as actual that which is theoretically possible. If, then, A, B, G, D form 
<A NAME="98"></A>an infinite magnitude that passes through the motion EZHO in the finite 
<A NAME="99"></A>time K, this involves the conclusion that an infinite motion is passed 
<A NAME="100"></A>through in a finite time: and whether the magnitude in question is finite 
<A NAME="101"></A>or infinite this is in either case impossible. Therefore the series must 
<A NAME="102"></A>come to an end, and there must be a first movent and a first moved: for 
<A NAME="103"></A>the fact that this impossibility results only from the assumption of a 
<A NAME="104"></A>particular case is immaterial, since the case assumed is theoretically 
<A NAME="105"></A>possible, and the assumption of a theoretically possible case ought not 
<A NAME="106"></A>to give rise to any impossible result.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="107"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>That which is the first movement of a thing-in the sense that it 
<A NAME="109"></A>supplies not 'that for the sake of which' but the source of the motion-is 
<A NAME="110"></A>always together with that which is moved by it by 'together' I mean that 
<A NAME="111"></A>there is nothing intermediate between them). This is universally true wherever 
<A NAME="112"></A>one thing is moved by another. And since there are three kinds of motion, 
<A NAME="113"></A>local, qualitative, and quantitative, there must also be three kinds of 
<A NAME="114"></A>movent, that which causes locomotion, that which causes alteration, and 
<A NAME="115"></A>that which causes increase or decrease.
<A NAME="116"></A><BR><BR>Let us begin with locomotion, for this is the primary motion. Everything 
<A NAME="117"></A>that is in locomotion is moved either by itself or by something else. In 
<A NAME="118"></A>the case of things that are moved by themselves it is evident that the 
<A NAME="119"></A>moved and the movent are together: for they contain within themselves their 
<A NAME="120"></A>first movent, so that there is nothing in between. The motion of things 
<A NAME="121"></A>that are moved by something else must proceed in one of four ways: for 
<A NAME="122"></A>there are four kinds of locomotion caused by something other than that 
<A NAME="123"></A>which is in motion, viz. pulling, pushing, carrying, and twirling. All 
<A NAME="124"></A>forms of locomotion are reducible to these. Thus pushing on is a form of 
<A NAME="125"></A>pushing in which that which is causing motion away from itself follows 
<A NAME="126"></A>up that which it pushes and continues to push it: pushing off occurs when 
<A NAME="127"></A>the movent does not follow up the thing that it has moved: throwing when 
<A NAME="128"></A>the movent causes a motion away from itself more violent than the natural 
<A NAME="129"></A>locomotion of the thing moved, which continues its course so long as it 
<A NAME="130"></A>is controlled by the motion imparted to it. Again, pushing apart and pushing 
<A NAME="131"></A>together are forms respectively of pushing off and pulling: pushing apart 
<A NAME="132"></A>is pushing off, which may be a motion either away from the pusher or away 
<A NAME="133"></A>from something else, while pushing together is pulling, which may be a 
<A NAME="134"></A>motion towards something else as well as the puller. We may similarly classify 
<A NAME="135"></A>all the varieties of these last two, e.g. packing and combing: the former 
<A NAME="136"></A>is a form of pushing together, the latter a form of pushing apart. The 
<A NAME="137"></A>same is true of the other processes of combination and separation (they 
<A NAME="138"></A>will all be found to be forms of pushing apart or of pushing together), 
<A NAME="139"></A>except such as are involved in the processes of becoming and perishing. 
<A NAME="140"></A>(At same time it is evident that there is no other kind of motion but combination 
<A NAME="141"></A>and separation: for they may all be apportioned to one or other of those 
<A NAME="142"></A>already mentioned.) Again, inhaling is a form of pulling, exhaling a form 
<A NAME="143"></A>of pushing: and the same is true of spitting and of all other motions that 
<A NAME="144"></A>proceed through the body, whether secretive or assimilative, the assimilative 
<A NAME="145"></A>being forms of pulling, the secretive of pushing off. All other kinds of 
<A NAME="146"></A>locomotion must be similarly reduced, for they all fall under one or other 
<A NAME="147"></A>of our four heads. And again, of these four, carrying and twirling are 
<A NAME="148"></A>to pulling and pushing. For carrying always follows one of the other three 
<A NAME="149"></A>methods, for that which is carried is in motion accidentally, because it 
<A NAME="150"></A>is in or upon something that is in motion, and that which carries it is 
<A NAME="151"></A>in doing so being either pulled or pushed or twirled; thus carrying belongs 
<A NAME="152"></A>to all the other three kinds of motion in common. And twirling is a compound 
<A NAME="153"></A>of pulling and pushing, for that which is twirling a thing must be pulling 
<A NAME="154"></A>one part of the thing and pushing another part, since it impels one part 
<A NAME="155"></A>away from itself and another part towards itself. If, therefore, it can 
<A NAME="156"></A>be shown that that which is pushing and that which is pushing and pulling 
<A NAME="157"></A>are adjacent respectively to that which is being pushed and that which 
<A NAME="158"></A>is being pulled, it will be evident that in all locomotion there is nothing 
<A NAME="159"></A>intermediate between moved and movent. But the former fact is clear even 
<A NAME="160"></A>from the definitions of pushing and pulling, for pushing is motion to something 
<A NAME="161"></A>else from oneself or from something else, and pulling is motion from something 
<A NAME="162"></A>else to oneself or to something else, when the motion of that which is 
<A NAME="163"></A>pulling is quicker than the motion that would separate from one another 
<A NAME="164"></A>the two things that are continuous: for it is this that causes one thing 
<A NAME="165"></A>to be pulled on along with the other. (It might indeed be thought that 
<A NAME="166"></A>there is a form of pulling that arises in another way: that wood, e.g. 
<A NAME="167"></A>pulls fire in a manner different from that described above. But it makes 
<A NAME="168"></A>no difference whether that which pulls is in motion or is stationary when 
<A NAME="169"></A>it is pulling: in the latter case it pulls to the place where it is, while 
<A NAME="170"></A>in the former it pulls to the place where it was.) Now it is impossible 
<A NAME="171"></A>to move anything either from oneself to something else or something else 
<A NAME="172"></A>to oneself without being in contact with it: it is evident, therefore, 
<A NAME="173"></A>that in all locomotion there is nothing intermediate between moved and 
<A NAME="174"></A>movent.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>Nor again is there anything intermediate between that which undergoes 
<A NAME="176"></A>and that which causes alteration: this can be proved by induction: for 
<A NAME="177"></A>in every case we find that the respective extremities of that which causes 
<A NAME="178"></A>and that which undergoes alteration are adjacent. For our assumption is 
<A NAME="179"></A>that things that are undergoing alteration are altered in virtue of their 
<A NAME="180"></A>being affected in respect of their so-called affective qualities, since 
<A NAME="181"></A>that which is of a certain quality is altered in so far as it is sensible, 
<A NAME="182"></A>and the characteristics in which bodies differ from one another are sensible 
<A NAME="183"></A>characteristics: for every body differs from another in possessing a greater 
<A NAME="184"></A>or lesser number of sensible characteristics or in possessing the same 
<A NAME="185"></A>sensible characteristics in a greater or lesser degree. But the alteration 
<A NAME="186"></A>of that which undergoes alteration is also caused by the above-mentioned 
<A NAME="187"></A>characteristics, which are affections of some particular underlying quality. 
<A NAME="188"></A>Thus we say that a thing is altered by becoming hot or sweet or thick or 
<A NAME="189"></A>dry or white: and we make these assertions alike of what is inanimate and 
<A NAME="190"></A>of what is animate, and further, where animate things are in question, 
<A NAME="191"></A>we make them both of the parts that have no power of sense-perception and 
<A NAME="192"></A>of the senses themselves. For in a way even the senses undergo alteration, 
<A NAME="193"></A>since the active sense is a motion through the body in the course of which 
<A NAME="194"></A>the sense is affected in a certain way. We see, then, that the animate 
<A NAME="195"></A>is capable of every kind of alteration of which the inanimate is capable: 
<A NAME="196"></A>but the inanimate is not capable of every kind of alteration of which the 
<A NAME="197"></A>animate is capable, since it is not capable of alteration in respect of 
<A NAME="198"></A>the senses: moreover the inanimate is unconscious of being affected by 
<A NAME="199"></A>alteration, whereas the animate is conscious of it, though there is nothing 
<A NAME="200"></A>to prevent the animate also being unconscious of it when the process of 
<A NAME="201"></A>the alteration does not concern the senses. Since, then, the alteration 
<A NAME="202"></A>of that which undergoes alteration is caused by sensible things, in every 
<A NAME="203"></A>case of such alteration it is evident that the respective extremities of 
<A NAME="204"></A>that which causes and that which undergoes alteration are adjacent. Thus 
<A NAME="205"></A>the air is continuous with that which causes the alteration, and the body 
<A NAME="206"></A>that undergoes alteration is continuous with the air. Again, the colour 
<A NAME="207"></A>is continuous with the light and the light with the sight. And the same 
<A NAME="208"></A>is true of hearing and smelling: for the primary movent in respect to the 
<A NAME="209"></A>moved is the air. Similarly, in the case of tasting, the flavour is adjacent 
<A NAME="210"></A>to the sense of taste. And it is just the same in the case of things that 
<A NAME="211"></A>are inanimate and incapable of sense-perception. Thus there can be nothing 
<A NAME="212"></A>intermediate between that which undergoes and that which causes 
<A NAME="213"></A>alteration.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>Nor, again, can there be anything intermediate between that which 
<A NAME="215"></A>suffers and that which causes increase: for the part of the latter that 
<A NAME="216"></A>starts the increase does so by becoming attached in such a way to the former 
<A NAME="217"></A>that the whole becomes one. Again, the decrease of that which suffers decrease 
<A NAME="218"></A>is caused by a part of the thing becoming detached. So that which causes 
<A NAME="219"></A>increase and that which causes decrease must be continuous with that which 
<A NAME="220"></A>suffers increase and that which suffers decrease respectively: and if two 
<A NAME="221"></A>things are continuous with one another there can be nothing intermediate 
<A NAME="222"></A>between them.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>It is evident, therefore, that between the extremities of the moved 
<A NAME="224"></A>and the movent that are respectively first and last in reference to the 
<A NAME="225"></A>moved there is nothing intermediate.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="226"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>Everything, we say, that undergoes alteration is altered by sensible 
<A NAME="228"></A>causes, and there is alteration only in things that are said to be essentially 
<A NAME="229"></A>affected by sensible things. The truth of this is to be seen from the following 
<A NAME="230"></A>considerations. Of all other things it would be most natural to suppose 
<A NAME="231"></A>that there is alteration in figures and shapes, and in acquired states 
<A NAME="232"></A>and in the processes of acquiring and losing these: but as a matter of 
<A NAME="233"></A>fact in neither of these two classes of things is there 
<A NAME="234"></A>alteration.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>In the first place, when a particular formation of a thing is completed, 
<A NAME="236"></A>we do not call it by the name of its material: e.g. we do not call the 
<A NAME="237"></A>statue 'bronze' or the pyramid 'wax' or the bed 'wood', but we use a derived 
<A NAME="238"></A>expression and call them 'of bronze', 'waxen', and 'wooden' respectively. 
<A NAME="239"></A>But when a thing has been affected and altered in any way we still call 
<A NAME="240"></A>it by the original name: thus we speak of the bronze or the wax being dry 
<A NAME="241"></A>or fluid or hard or hot.
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>And not only so: we also speak of the particular fluid or hot substance 
<A NAME="243"></A>as being bronze, giving the material the same name as that which we use 
<A NAME="244"></A>to describe the affection.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>Since, therefore, having regard to the figure or shape of a thing 
<A NAME="246"></A>we no longer call that which has become of a certain figure by the name 
<A NAME="247"></A>of the material that exhibits the figure, whereas having regard to a thing's 
<A NAME="248"></A>affections or alterations we still call it by the name of its material, 
<A NAME="249"></A>it is evident that becomings of the former kind cannot be 
<A NAME="250"></A>alterations.
<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>Moreover it would seem absurd even to speak in this way, to speak, 
<A NAME="252"></A>that is to say, of a man or house or anything else that has come into existence 
<A NAME="253"></A>as having been altered. Though it may be true that every such becoming 
<A NAME="254"></A>is necessarily the result of something's being altered, the result, e.g. 
<A NAME="255"></A>of the material's being condensed or rarefied or heated or cooled, nevertheless 
<A NAME="256"></A>it is not the things that are coming into existence that are altered, and 
<A NAME="257"></A>their becoming is not an alteration.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>Again, acquired states, whether of the body or of the soul, are 
<A NAME="259"></A>not alterations. For some are excellences and others are defects, and neither 
<A NAME="260"></A>excellence nor defect is an alteration: excellence is a perfection (for 
<A NAME="261"></A>when anything acquires its proper excellence we call it perfect, since 
<A NAME="262"></A>it is then if ever that we have a thing in its natural state: e.g. we have 
<A NAME="263"></A>a perfect circle when we have one as good as possible), while defect is 
<A NAME="264"></A>a perishing of or departure from this condition. So as when speaking of 
<A NAME="265"></A>a house we do not call its arrival at perfection an alteration (for it 
<A NAME="266"></A>would be absurd to suppose that the coping or the tiling is an alteration 
<A NAME="267"></A>or that in receiving its coping or its tiling a house is altered and not 
<A NAME="268"></A>perfected), the same also holds good in the case of excellences and defects 
<A NAME="269"></A>and of the persons or things that possess or acquire them: for excellences 
<A NAME="270"></A>are perfections of a thing's nature and defects are departures from it: 
<A NAME="271"></A>consequently they are not alterations.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>Further, we say that all excellences depend upon particular relations. 
<A NAME="273"></A>Thus bodily excellences such as health and a good state of body we regard 
<A NAME="274"></A>as consisting in a blending of hot and cold elements within the body in 
<A NAME="275"></A>due proportion, in relation either to one another or to the surrounding 
<A NAME="276"></A>atmosphere: and in like manner we regard beauty, strength, and all the 
<A NAME="277"></A>other bodily excellences and defects. Each of them exists in virtue of 
<A NAME="278"></A>a particular relation and puts that which possesses it in a good or bad 
<A NAME="279"></A>condition with regard to its proper affections, where by 'proper' affections 
<A NAME="280"></A>I mean those influences that from the natural constitution of a thing tend 
<A NAME="281"></A>to promote or destroy its existence. Since then, relatives are neither 
<A NAME="282"></A>themselves alterations nor the subjects of alteration or of becoming or 
<A NAME="283"></A>in fact of any change whatever, it is evident that neither states nor the 
<A NAME="284"></A>processes of losing and acquiring states are alterations, though it may 
<A NAME="285"></A>be true that their becoming or perishing is necessarily, like the becoming 
<A NAME="286"></A>or perishing of a specific character or form, the result of the alteration 
<A NAME="287"></A>of certain other things, e.g. hot and cold or dry and wet elements or the 
<A NAME="288"></A>elements, whatever they may be, on which the states primarily depend. For 
<A NAME="289"></A>each several bodily defect or excellence involves a relation with those 
<A NAME="290"></A>things from which the possessor of the defect or excellence is naturally 
<A NAME="291"></A>subject to alteration: thus excellence disposes its possessor to be unaffected 
<A NAME="292"></A>by these influences or to be affected by those of them that ought to be 
<A NAME="293"></A>admitted, while defect disposes its possessor to be affected by them or 
<A NAME="294"></A>to be unaffected by those of them that ought to be admitted.
<A NAME="295"></A><BR><BR>And the case is similar in regard to the states of the soul, all 
<A NAME="296"></A>of which (like those of body) exist in virtue of particular relations, 
<A NAME="297"></A>the excellences being perfections of nature and the defects departures 
<A NAME="298"></A>from it: moreover, excellence puts its possessor in good condition, while 
<A NAME="299"></A>defect puts its possessor in a bad condition, to meet his proper affections. 
<A NAME="300"></A>Consequently these cannot any more than the bodily states be alterations, 
<A NAME="301"></A>nor can the processes of losing and acquiring them be so, though their 
<A NAME="302"></A>becoming is necessarily the result of an alteration of the sensitive part 
<A NAME="303"></A>of the soul, and this is altered by sensible objects: for all moral excellence 
<A NAME="304"></A>is concerned with bodily pleasures and pains, which again depend either 
<A NAME="305"></A>upon acting or upon remembering or upon anticipating. Now those that depend 
<A NAME="306"></A>upon action are determined by sense-perception, i.e. they are stimulated 
<A NAME="307"></A>by something sensible: and those that depend upon memory or anticipation 
<A NAME="308"></A>are likewise to be traced to sense-perception, for in these cases pleasure 
<A NAME="309"></A>is felt either in remembering what one has experienced or in anticipating 
<A NAME="310"></A>what one is going to experience. Thus all pleasure of this kind must be 
<A NAME="311"></A>produced by sensible things: and since the presence in any one of moral 
<A NAME="312"></A>defect or excellence involves the presence in him of pleasure or pain (with 
<A NAME="313"></A>which moral excellence and defect are always concerned), and these pleasures 
<A NAME="314"></A>and pains are alterations of the sensitive part, it is evident that the 
<A NAME="315"></A>loss and acquisition of these states no less than the loss and acquisition 
<A NAME="316"></A>of the states of the body must be the result of the alteration of something 
<A NAME="317"></A>else. Consequently, though their becoming is accompanied by an alteration, 
<A NAME="318"></A>they are not themselves alterations.
<A NAME="319"></A><BR><BR>Again, the states of the intellectual part of the soul are not 
<A NAME="320"></A>alterations, nor is there any becoming of them. In the first place it is 
<A NAME="321"></A>much more true of the possession of knowledge that it depends upon a particular 
<A NAME="322"></A>relation. And further, it is evident that there is no becoming of these 
<A NAME="323"></A>states. For that which is potentially possessed of knowledge becomes actually 
<A NAME="324"></A>possessed of it not by being set in motion at all itself but by reason 
<A NAME="325"></A>of the presence of something else: i.e. it is when it meets with the particular 
<A NAME="326"></A>object that it knows in a manner the particular through its knowledge of 
<A NAME="327"></A>the universal. (Again, there is no becoming of the actual use and activity 
<A NAME="328"></A>of these states, unless it is thought that there is a becoming of vision 
<A NAME="329"></A>and touching and that the activity in question is similar to these.) And 
<A NAME="330"></A>the original acquisition of knowledge is not a becoming or an alteration: 
<A NAME="331"></A>for the terms 'knowing' and 'understanding' imply that the intellect has 
<A NAME="332"></A>reached a state of rest and come to a standstill, and there is no becoming 
<A NAME="333"></A>that leads to a state of rest, since, as we have said above, change at 
<A NAME="334"></A>all can have a becoming. Moreover, just as to say, when any one has passed 
<A NAME="335"></A>from a state of intoxication or sleep or disease to the contrary state, 
<A NAME="336"></A>that he has become possessed of knowledge again is incorrect in spite of 
<A NAME="337"></A>the fact that he was previously incapable of using his knowledge, so, too, 
<A NAME="338"></A>when any one originally acquires the state, it is incorrect to say that 
<A NAME="339"></A>he becomes possessed of knowledge: for the possession of understanding 
<A NAME="340"></A>and knowledge is produced by the soul's settling down out of the restlessness 
<A NAME="341"></A>natural to it. Hence, too, in learning and in forming judgements on matters 
<A NAME="342"></A>relating to their sense-perceptions children are inferior to adults owing 
<A NAME="343"></A>to the great amount of restlessness and motion in their souls. Nature itself 
<A NAME="344"></A>causes the soul to settle down and come to a state of rest for the performance 
<A NAME="345"></A>of some of its functions, while for the performance of others other things 
<A NAME="346"></A>do so: but in either case the result is brought about through the alteration 
<A NAME="347"></A>of something in the body, as we see in the case of the use and activity 
<A NAME="348"></A>of the intellect arising from a man's becoming sober or being awakened. 
<A NAME="349"></A>It is evident, then, from the preceding argument that alteration and being 
<A NAME="350"></A>altered occur in sensible things and in the sensitive part of the soul, 
<A NAME="351"></A>and, except accidentally, in nothing else.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="352"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>A difficulty may be raised as to whether every motion is commensurable 
<A NAME="354"></A>with every other or not. Now if they are all commensurable and if two things 
<A NAME="355"></A>to have the same velocity must accomplish an equal motion in an equal time, 
<A NAME="356"></A>then we may have a circumference equal to a straight line, or, of course, 
<A NAME="357"></A>the one may be greater or less than the other. Further, if one thing alters 
<A NAME="358"></A>and another accomplishes a locomotion in an equal time, we may have an 
<A NAME="359"></A>alteration and a locomotion equal to one another: thus an affection will 
<A NAME="360"></A>be equal to a length, which is impossible. But is it not only when an equal 
<A NAME="361"></A>motion is accomplished by two things in an equal time that the velocities 
<A NAME="362"></A>of the two are equal? Now an affection cannot be equal to a length. Therefore 
<A NAME="363"></A>there cannot be an alteration equal to or less than a locomotion: and consequently 
<A NAME="364"></A>it is not the case that every motion is commensurable with every 
<A NAME="365"></A>other.
<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>But how will our conclusion work out in the case of the circle 
<A NAME="367"></A>and the straight line? It would be absurd to suppose that the motion of 
<A NAME="368"></A>one in a circle and of another in a straight line cannot be similar, but 
<A NAME="369"></A>that the one must inevitably move more quickly or more slowly than the 
<A NAME="370"></A>other, just as if the course of one were downhill and of the other uphill. 
<A NAME="371"></A>Moreover it does not as a matter of fact make any difference to the argument 
<A NAME="372"></A>to say that the one motion must inevitably be quicker or slower than the 
<A NAME="373"></A>other: for then the circumference can be greater or less than the straight 
<A NAME="374"></A>line; and if so it is possible for the two to be equal. For if in the time 
<A NAME="375"></A>A the quicker (B) passes over the distance B' and the slower (G) passes 
<A NAME="376"></A>over the distance G', B' will be greater than G': for this is what we took 
<A NAME="377"></A>'quicker' to mean: and so quicker motion also implies that one thing traverses 
<A NAME="378"></A>an equal distance in less time than another: consequently there will be 
<A NAME="379"></A>a part of A in which B will pass over a part of the circle equal to G', 
<A NAME="380"></A>while G will occupy the whole of A in passing over G'. None the less, if 
<A NAME="381"></A>the two motions are commensurable, we are confronted with the consequence 
<A NAME="382"></A>stated above, viz. that there may be a straight line equal to a circle. 
<A NAME="383"></A>But these are not commensurable: and so the corresponding motions are not 
<A NAME="384"></A>commensurable either.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>But may we say that things are always commensurable if the same 
<A NAME="386"></A>terms are applied to them without equivocation? e.g. a pen, a wine, and 
<A NAME="387"></A>the highest note in a scale are not commensurable: we cannot say whether 
<A NAME="388"></A>any one of them is sharper than any other: and why is this? they are incommensurable 
<A NAME="389"></A>because it is only equivocally that the same term 'sharp' is applied to 
<A NAME="390"></A>them: whereas the highest note in a scale is commensurable with the leading-note, 
<A NAME="391"></A>because the term 'sharp' has the same meaning as applied to both. Can it 
<A NAME="392"></A>be, then, that the term 'quick' has not the same meaning as applied to 
<A NAME="393"></A>straight motion and to circular motion respectively? If so, far less will 
<A NAME="394"></A>it have the same meaning as applied to alteration and to 
<A NAME="395"></A>locomotion.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>Or shall we in the first place deny that things are always commensurable 
<A NAME="397"></A>if the same terms are applied to them without equivocation? For the term 
<A NAME="398"></A>'much' has the same meaning whether applied to water or to air, yet water 
<A NAME="399"></A>and air are not commensurable in respect of it: or, if this illustration 
<A NAME="400"></A>is not considered satisfactory, 'double' at any rate would seem to have 
<A NAME="401"></A>the same meaning as applied to each (denoting in each case the proportion 
<A NAME="402"></A>of two to one), yet water and air are not commensurable in respect of it. 
<A NAME="403"></A>But here again may we not take up the same position and say that the term 
<A NAME="404"></A>'much' is equivocal? In fact there are some terms of which even the definitions 
<A NAME="405"></A>are equivocal; e.g. if 'much' were defined as 'so much and more','so much' 
<A NAME="406"></A>would mean something different in different cases: 'equal' is similarly 
<A NAME="407"></A>equivocal; and 'one' again is perhaps inevitably an equivocal term; and 
<A NAME="408"></A>if 'one' is equivocal, so is 'two'. Otherwise why is it that some things 
<A NAME="409"></A>are commensurable while others are not, if the nature of the attribute 
<A NAME="410"></A>in the two cases is really one and the same?
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>Can it be that the incommensurability of two things in respect 
<A NAME="412"></A>of any attribute is due to a difference in that which is primarily capable 
<A NAME="413"></A>of carrying the attribute? Thus horse and dog are so commensurable that 
<A NAME="414"></A>we may say which is the whiter, since that which primarily contains the 
<A NAME="415"></A>whiteness is the same in both, viz. the surface: and similarly they are 
<A NAME="416"></A>commensurable in respect of size. But water and speech are not commensurable 
<A NAME="417"></A>in respect of clearness, since that which primarily contains the attribute 
<A NAME="418"></A>is different in the two cases. It would seem, however that we must reject 
<A NAME="419"></A>this solution, since clearly we could thus make all equivocal attributes 
<A NAME="420"></A>univocal and say merely that that contains each of them is different in 
<A NAME="421"></A>different cases: thus 'equality', 'sweetness', and 'whiteness' will severally 
<A NAME="422"></A>always be the same, though that which contains them is different in different 
<A NAME="423"></A>cases. Moreover, it is not any casual thing that is capable of carrying 
<A NAME="424"></A>any attribute: each single attribute can be carried primarily only by one 
<A NAME="425"></A>single thing.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>Must we then say that, if two things are to be commensurable in 
<A NAME="427"></A>respect of any attribute, not only must the attribute in question be applicable 
<A NAME="428"></A>to both without equivocation, but there must also be no specific differences 
<A NAME="429"></A>either in the attribute itself or in that which contains the attribute-that 
<A NAME="430"></A>these, I mean, must not be divisible in the way in which colour is divided 
<A NAME="431"></A>into kinds? Thus in this respect one thing will not be commensurable with 
<A NAME="432"></A>another, i.e. we cannot say that one is more coloured than the other where 
<A NAME="433"></A>only colour in general and not any particular colour is meant; but they 
<A NAME="434"></A>are commensurable in respect of whiteness.
<A NAME="435"></A><BR><BR>Similarly in the case of motion: two things are of the same velocity 
<A NAME="436"></A>if they occupy an equal time in accomplishing a certain equal amount of 
<A NAME="437"></A>motion. Suppose, then, that in a certain time an alteration is undergone 
<A NAME="438"></A>by one half of a body's length and a locomotion is accomplished the other 
<A NAME="439"></A>half: can be say that in this case the alteration is equal to the locomotion 
<A NAME="440"></A>and of the same velocity? That would be absurd, and the reason is that 
<A NAME="441"></A>there are different species of motion. And if in consequence of this we 
<A NAME="442"></A>must say that two things are of equal velocity if they accomplish locomotion 
<A NAME="443"></A>over an equal distance in an equal time, we have to admit the equality 
<A NAME="444"></A>of a straight line and a circumference. What, then, is the reason of this? 
<A NAME="445"></A>Is it that locomotion is a genus or that line is a genus? (We may leave 
<A NAME="446"></A>the time out of account, since that is one and the same.) If the lines 
<A NAME="447"></A>are specifically different, the locomotions also differ specifically from 
<A NAME="448"></A>one another: for locomotion is specifically differentiated according to 
<A NAME="449"></A>the specific differentiation of that over which it takes place. (It is 
<A NAME="450"></A>also similarly differentiated, it would seem, accordingly as the instrument 
<A NAME="451"></A>of the locomotion is different: thus if feet are the instrument, it is 
<A NAME="452"></A>walking, if wings it is flying; but perhaps we should rather say that this 
<A NAME="453"></A>is not so, and that in this case the differences in the locomotion are 
<A NAME="454"></A>merely differences of posture in that which is in motion.) We may say, 
<A NAME="455"></A>therefore, that things are of equal velocity in an equal time they traverse 
<A NAME="456"></A>the same magnitude: and when I call it 'the same' I mean that it contains 
<A NAME="457"></A>no specific difference and therefore no difference in the motion that takes 
<A NAME="458"></A>place over it. So we have now to consider how motion is differentiated: 
<A NAME="459"></A>and this discussion serves to show that the genus is not a unity but contains 
<A NAME="460"></A>a plurality latent in it and distinct from it, and that in the case of 
<A NAME="461"></A>equivocal terms sometimes the different senses in which they are used are 
<A NAME="462"></A>far removed from one another, while sometimes there is a certain likeness 
<A NAME="463"></A>between them, and sometimes again they are nearly related either generically 
<A NAME="464"></A>or analogically, with the result that they seem not to be equivocal though 
<A NAME="465"></A>they really are.
<A NAME="466"></A><BR><BR>When, then, is there a difference of species? Is an attribute specifically 
<A NAME="467"></A>different if the subject is different while the attribute is the same, 
<A NAME="468"></A>or must the attribute itself be different as well? And how are we to define 
<A NAME="469"></A>the limits of a species? What will enable us to decide that particular 
<A NAME="470"></A>instances of whiteness or sweetness are the same or different? Is it enough 
<A NAME="471"></A>that it appears different in one subject from what appears in another? 
<A NAME="472"></A>Or must there be no sameness at all? And further, where alteration is in 
<A NAME="473"></A>question, how is one alteration to be of equal velocity with another? One 
<A NAME="474"></A>person may be cured quickly and another slowly, and cures may also be simultaneous: 
<A NAME="475"></A>so that, recovery of health being an alteration, we have here alterations 
<A NAME="476"></A>of equal velocity, since each alteration occupies an equal time. But what 
<A NAME="477"></A>alteration? We cannot here speak of an 'equal' alteration: what corresponds 
<A NAME="478"></A>in the category of quality to equality in the category of quantity is 'likeness'. 
<A NAME="479"></A>However, let us say that there is equal velocity where the same change 
<A NAME="480"></A>is accomplished in an equal time. Are we, then, to find the commensurability 
<A NAME="481"></A>in the subject of the affection or in the affection itself? In the case 
<A NAME="482"></A>that we have just been considering it is the fact that health is one and 
<A NAME="483"></A>the same that enables us to arrive at the conclusion that the one alteration 
<A NAME="484"></A>is neither more nor less than the other, but that both are alike. If on 
<A NAME="485"></A>the other hand the affection is different in the two cases, e.g. when the 
<A NAME="486"></A>alterations take the form of becoming white and becoming healthy respectively, 
<A NAME="487"></A>here there is no sameness or equality or likeness inasmuch as the difference 
<A NAME="488"></A>in the affections at once makes the alterations specifically different, 
<A NAME="489"></A>and there is no unity of alteration any more than there would be unity 
<A NAME="490"></A>of locomotion under like conditions. So we must find out how many species 
<A NAME="491"></A>there are of alteration and of locomotion respectively. Now if the things 
<A NAME="492"></A>that are in motion-that is to say, the things to which the motions belong 
<A NAME="493"></A>essentially and not accidentally-differ specifically, then their respective 
<A NAME="494"></A>motions will also differ specifically: if on the other hand they differ 
<A NAME="495"></A>generically or numerically, the motions also will differ generically or 
<A NAME="496"></A>numerically as the case may be. But there still remains the question whether, 
<A NAME="497"></A>supposing that two alterations are of equal velocity, we ought to look 
<A NAME="498"></A>for this equality in the sameness (or likeness) of the affections, or in 
<A NAME="499"></A>the things altered, to see e.g. whether a certain quantity of each has 
<A NAME="500"></A>become white. Or ought we not rather to look for it in both? That is to 
<A NAME="501"></A>say, the alterations are the same or different according as the affections 
<A NAME="502"></A>are the same or different, while they are equal or unequal according as 
<A NAME="503"></A>the things altered are equal or unequal.
<A NAME="504"></A><BR><BR>And now we must consider the same question in the case of becoming 
<A NAME="505"></A>and perishing: how is one becoming of equal velocity with another? They 
<A NAME="506"></A>are of equal velocity if in an equal time there are produced two things 
<A NAME="507"></A>that are the same and specifically inseparable, e.g. two men (not merely 
<A NAME="508"></A>generically inseparable as e.g. two animals). Similarly one is quicker 
<A NAME="509"></A>than the other if in an equal time the product is different in the two 
<A NAME="510"></A>cases. I state it thus because we have no pair of terms that will convey 
<A NAME="511"></A>this 'difference' in the way in which unlikeness is conveyed. If we adopt 
<A NAME="512"></A>the theory that it is number that constitutes being, we may indeed speak 
<A NAME="513"></A>of a 'greater number' and a 'lesser number' within the same species, but 
<A NAME="514"></A>there is no common term that will include both relations, nor are there 
<A NAME="515"></A>terms to express each of them separately in the same way as we indicate 
<A NAME="516"></A>a higher degree or preponderance of an affection by 'more', of a quantity 
<A NAME="517"></A>by 'greater.'
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="518"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="519"></A><BR><BR>Now since wherever there is a movent, its motion always acts upon 
<A NAME="520"></A>something, is always in something, and always extends to something (by 
<A NAME="521"></A>'is always in something' I mean that it occupies a time: and by 'extends 
<A NAME="522"></A>to something' I mean that it involves the traversing of a certain amount 
<A NAME="523"></A>of distance: for at any moment when a thing is causing motion, it also 
<A NAME="524"></A>has caused motion, so that there must always be a certain amount of distance 
<A NAME="525"></A>that has been traversed and a certain amount of time that has been occupied). 
<A NAME="526"></A>then, A the movement have moved B a distance G in a time D, then in the 
<A NAME="527"></A>same time the same force A will move 1/2B twice the distance G, and in 
<A NAME="528"></A>1/2D it will move 1/2B the whole distance for G: thus the rules of proportion 
<A NAME="529"></A>will be observed. Again if a given force move a given weight a certain 
<A NAME="530"></A>distance in a certain time and half the distance in half the time, half 
<A NAME="531"></A>the motive power will move half the weight the same distance in the same 
<A NAME="532"></A>time. Let E represent half the motive power A and Z half the weight B: 
<A NAME="533"></A>then the ratio between the motive power and the weight in the one case 
<A NAME="534"></A>is similar and proportionate to the ratio in the other, so that each force 
<A NAME="535"></A>will cause the same distance to be traversed in the same time. But if E 
<A NAME="536"></A>move Z a distance G in a time D, it does not necessarily follow that E 
<A NAME="537"></A>can move twice Z half the distance G in the same time. If, then, A move 
<A NAME="538"></A>B a distance G in a time D, it does not follow that E, being half of A, 
<A NAME="539"></A>will in the time D or in any fraction of it cause B to traverse a part 
<A NAME="540"></A>of G the ratio between which and the whole of G is proportionate to that 
<A NAME="541"></A>between A and E (whatever fraction of AE may be): in fact it might well 
<A NAME="542"></A>be that it will cause no motion at all; for it does not follow that, if 
<A NAME="543"></A>a given motive power causes a certain amount of motion, half that power 
<A NAME="544"></A>will cause motion either of any particular amount or in any length of time: 
<A NAME="545"></A>otherwise one man might move a ship, since both the motive power of the 
<A NAME="546"></A>ship-haulers and the distance that they all cause the ship to traverse 
<A NAME="547"></A>are divisible into as many parts as there are men. Hence Zeno's reasoning 
<A NAME="548"></A>is false when he argues that there is no part of the millet that does not 
<A NAME="549"></A>make a sound: for there is no reason why any such part should not in any 
<A NAME="550"></A>length of time fail to move the air that the whole bushel moves in falling. 
<A NAME="551"></A>In fact it does not of itself move even such a quantity of the air as it 
<A NAME="552"></A>would move if this part were by itself: for no part even exists otherwise 
<A NAME="553"></A>than potentially.
<A NAME="554"></A><BR><BR>If on the other hand we have two forces each of which separately 
<A NAME="555"></A>moves one of two weights a given distance in a given time, then the forces 
<A NAME="556"></A>in combination will move the combined weights an equal distance in an equal 
<A NAME="557"></A>time: for in this case the rules of proportion apply.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>Then does this hold good of alteration and of increase also? Surely 
<A NAME="559"></A>it does, for in any given case we have a definite thing that cause increase 
<A NAME="560"></A>and a definite thing that suffers increase, and the one causes and the 
<A NAME="561"></A>other suffers a certain amount of increase in a certain amount of time. 
<A NAME="562"></A>Similarly we have a definite thing that causes alteration and a definite 
<A NAME="563"></A>thing that undergoes alteration, and a certain amount, or rather degree, 
<A NAME="564"></A>of alteration is completed in a certain amount of time: thus in twice as 
<A NAME="565"></A>much time twice as much alteration will be completed and conversely twice 
<A NAME="566"></A>as much alteration will occupy twice as much time: and the alteration of 
<A NAME="567"></A>half of its object will occupy half as much time and in half as much time 
<A NAME="568"></A>half of the object will be altered: or again, in the same amount of time 
<A NAME="569"></A>it will be altered twice as much.
<A NAME="570"></A><BR><BR>On the other hand if that which causes alteration or increase causes 
<A NAME="571"></A>a certain amount of increase or alteration respectively in a certain amount 
<A NAME="572"></A>of time, it does not necessarily follow that half the force will occupy 
<A NAME="573"></A>twice the time in altering or increasing the object, or that in twice the 
<A NAME="574"></A>time the alteration or increase will be completed by it: it may happen 
<A NAME="575"></A>that there will be no alteration or increase at all, the case being the 
<A NAME="576"></A>same as with the weight.
