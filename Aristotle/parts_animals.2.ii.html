<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>The nature and the number of the parts of which animals are severally composed 
<A NAME="12"></A>are matters which have already been set forth in detail in the book of 
<A NAME="13"></A>Researches about Animals. We have now to inquire what are the causes that 
<A NAME="14"></A>in each case have determined this composition, a subject quite distinct 
<A NAME="15"></A>from that dealt with in the Researches.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>Now there are three degrees of composition; and of these the first 
<A NAME="17"></A>in order, as all will allow, is composition out of what some call the elements, 
<A NAME="18"></A>such as earth, air, water, fire. Perhaps, however, it would be more accurate 
<A NAME="19"></A>to say composition out of the elementary forces; nor indeed out of all 
<A NAME="20"></A>of these, but out of a limited number of them, as defined in previous treatises. 
<A NAME="21"></A>For fluid and solid, hot and cold, form the material of all composite bodies; 
<A NAME="22"></A>and all other differences are secondary to these, such differences, that 
<A NAME="23"></A>is, as heaviness or lightness, density or rarity, roughness or smoothness, 
<A NAME="24"></A>and any other such properties of matter as there may be. second degree 
<A NAME="25"></A>of composition is that by which the homogeneous parts of animals, such 
<A NAME="26"></A>as bone, flesh, and the like, are constituted out of the primary substances. 
<A NAME="27"></A>The third and last stage is the composition which forms the heterogeneous 
<A NAME="28"></A>parts, such as face, hand, and the rest.
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>Now the order of actual development and the order of logical existence 
<A NAME="30"></A>are always the inverse of each other. For that which is posterior in the 
<A NAME="31"></A>order of development is antecedent in the order of nature, and that is 
<A NAME="32"></A>genetically last which in nature is first.
<A NAME="33"></A><BR><BR>(That this is so is manifest by induction; for a house does not 
<A NAME="34"></A>exist for the sake of bricks and stones, but these materials for the sake 
<A NAME="35"></A>of the house; and the same is the case with the materials of other bodies. 
<A NAME="36"></A>Nor is induction required to show this. it is included in our conception 
<A NAME="37"></A>of generation. For generation is a process from a something to a something; 
<A NAME="38"></A>that which is generated having a cause in which it originates and a cause 
<A NAME="39"></A>in which it ends. The originating cause is the primary efficient cause, 
<A NAME="40"></A>which is something already endowed with tangible existence, while the final 
<A NAME="41"></A>cause is some definite form or similar end; for man generates man, and 
<A NAME="42"></A>plant generates plant, in each case out of the underlying 
<A NAME="43"></A>material.)
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>In order of time, then, the material and the generative process 
<A NAME="45"></A>must necessarily be anterior to the being that is generated; but in logical 
<A NAME="46"></A>order the definitive character and form of each being precedes the material. 
<A NAME="47"></A>This is evident if one only tries to define the process of formation. For 
<A NAME="48"></A>the definition of house-building includes and presupposes that of the house; 
<A NAME="49"></A>but the definition of the house does not include nor presuppose that of 
<A NAME="50"></A>house-building; and the same is true of all other productions. So that 
<A NAME="51"></A>it must necessarily be that the elementary material exists for the sake 
<A NAME="52"></A>of the homogeneous parts, seeing that these are genetically posterior to 
<A NAME="53"></A>it, just as the heterogeneous parts are posterior genetically to them. 
<A NAME="54"></A>For these heterogeneous parts have reached the end and goal, having the 
<A NAME="55"></A>third degree of composition, in which degree generation or development 
<A NAME="56"></A>often attains its final term.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>Animals, then, are composed of homogeneous parts, and are also 
<A NAME="58"></A>composed of heterogeneous parts. The former, however, exist for the sake 
<A NAME="59"></A>of the latter. For the active functions and operations of the body are 
<A NAME="60"></A>carried on by these; that is, by the heterogeneous parts, such as the eye, 
<A NAME="61"></A>the nostril, the whole face, the fingers, the hand, and the whole arm. 
<A NAME="62"></A>But inasmuch as there is a great variety in the functions and motions not 
<A NAME="63"></A>only of aggregate animals but also of the individual organs, it is necessary 
<A NAME="64"></A>that the substances out of which these are composed shall present a diversity 
<A NAME="65"></A>of properties. For some purposes softness is advantageous, for others hardness; 
<A NAME="66"></A>some parts must be capable of extension, others of flexion. Such properties, 
<A NAME="67"></A>then, are distributed separately to the different homogeneous parts, one 
<A NAME="68"></A>being soft another hard, one fluid another solid, one viscous another brittle; 
<A NAME="69"></A>whereas each of the heterogeneous parts presents a combination of multifarious 
<A NAME="70"></A>properties. For the hand, to take an example, requires one property to 
<A NAME="71"></A>enable it to effect pressure, and another and different property for simple 
<A NAME="72"></A>prehension. For this reason the active or executive parts of the body are 
<A NAME="73"></A>compounded out of bones, sinews, flesh, and the like, but not these latter 
<A NAME="74"></A>out of the former.
<A NAME="75"></A><BR><BR>So far, then, as has yet been stated, the relations between these 
<A NAME="76"></A>two orders of parts are determined by a final cause. We have, however, 
<A NAME="77"></A>to inquire whether necessity may not also have a share in the matter; and 
<A NAME="78"></A>it must be admitted that these mutual relations could not from the very 
<A NAME="79"></A>beginning have possibly been other than they are. For heterogeneous parts 
<A NAME="80"></A>can be made up out of homogeneous parts, either from a plurality of them, 
<A NAME="81"></A>or from a single one, as is the case with some of the viscera which, varying 
<A NAME="82"></A>in configuration, are yet, to speak broadly, formed from a single homogeneous 
<A NAME="83"></A>substance; but that homogeneous substances should be formed out of a combination 
<A NAME="84"></A>of heterogeneous parts is clearly an impossibility. For these causes, then, 
<A NAME="85"></A>some parts of animals are simple and homogeneous, while others are composite 
<A NAME="86"></A>and heterogeneous; and dividing the parts into the active or executive 
<A NAME="87"></A>and the sensitive, each one of the former is, as before said, heterogeneous, 
<A NAME="88"></A>and each one of the latter homogeneous. For it is in homogeneous parts 
<A NAME="89"></A>alone that sensation can occur, as the following considerations 
<A NAME="90"></A>show.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>Each sense is confined to a single order of sensibles, and its 
<A NAME="92"></A>organ must be such as to admit the action of that kind or order. But it 
<A NAME="93"></A>is only that which is endowed with a property in posse that is acted on 
<A NAME="94"></A>by that which has the like property in esse, so that the two are the same 
<A NAME="95"></A>in kind, and if the latter is single so also is the former. Thus it is 
<A NAME="96"></A>that while no physiologists ever dream of saying of the hand or face or 
<A NAME="97"></A>other such part that one is earth, another water, another fire, they couple 
<A NAME="98"></A>each separate sense-organ with a separate element, asserting this one to 
<A NAME="99"></A>be air and that other to be fire.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>Sensation, then, is confined to the simple or homogeneous parts. 
<A NAME="101"></A>But, as might reasonably be expected, the organ of touch, though still 
<A NAME="102"></A>homogeneous, is yet the least simple of all the sense-organs. For touch 
<A NAME="103"></A>more than any other sense appears to be correlated to several distinct 
<A NAME="104"></A>kinds of objects, and to recognize more than one category of contrasts, 
<A NAME="105"></A>heat and cold, for instance, solidity and fluidity, and other similar oppositions. 
<A NAME="106"></A>Accordingly, the organ which deals with these varied objects is of all 
<A NAME="107"></A>the sense-organs the most corporeal, being either the flesh, or the substance 
<A NAME="108"></A>which in some animals takes the place of flesh.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>Now as there cannot possibly be an animal without sensation, it 
<A NAME="110"></A>follows as a necessary consequence that every animal must have some homogeneous 
<A NAME="111"></A>parts; for these alone are capable of sensation, the heterogeneous parts 
<A NAME="112"></A>serving for the active functions. Again, as the sensory faculty, the motor 
<A NAME="113"></A>faculty, and the nutritive faculty are all lodged in one and the same part 
<A NAME="114"></A>of the body, as was stated in a former treatise, it is necessary that the 
<A NAME="115"></A>part which is the primary seat of these principles shall on the one hand, 
<A NAME="116"></A>in its character of general sensory recipient, be one of the simple parts; 
<A NAME="117"></A>and on the other hand shall, in its motor and active character, be one 
<A NAME="118"></A>of the heterogeneous parts. For this reason it is the heart which in sanguineous 
<A NAME="119"></A>animals constitutes this central part, and in bloodless animals it is that 
<A NAME="120"></A>which takes the place of a heart. For the heart, like the other viscera, 
<A NAME="121"></A>is one of the homogeneous parts; for, if cut up, its pieces are homogeneous 
<A NAME="122"></A>in substance with each other. But it is at the same time heterogeneous 
<A NAME="123"></A>in virtue of its definite configuration. And the same is true of the other 
<A NAME="124"></A>so-called viscera, which are indeed formed from the same material as the 
<A NAME="125"></A>heart. For all these viscera have a sanguineous character owing to their 
<A NAME="126"></A>being situated upon vascular ducts and branches. For just as a stream of 
<A NAME="127"></A>water deposits mud, so the various viscera, the heart excepted, are, as 
<A NAME="128"></A>it were, deposits from the stream of blood in the vessels. And as to the 
<A NAME="129"></A>heart, the very starting-point of the vessels, and the actual seat of the 
<A NAME="130"></A>force by which the blood is first fabricated, it is but what one would 
<A NAME="131"></A>naturally expect, that out of the selfsame nutriment of which it is the 
<A NAME="132"></A>recipient its own proper substance shall be formed. Such, then, are the 
<A NAME="133"></A>reasons why the viscera are of sanguineous aspect; and why in one point 
<A NAME="134"></A>of view they are homogeneous, in another heterogeneous.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="135"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>Of the homogeneous parts of animals, some are soft and fluid, others 
<A NAME="137"></A>hard and solid; and of the former some are fluid permanently, others only 
<A NAME="138"></A>so long as they are in the living body. Such are blood, serum, lard, suet, 
<A NAME="139"></A>marrow, semen, bile, milk when present, flesh, and their various analogues. 
<A NAME="140"></A>For the parts enumerated are not to be found in all animals, some animals 
<A NAME="141"></A>only having parts analogous to them. Of the hard and solid homogeneous 
<A NAME="142"></A>parts bone, fish-spine, sinew, blood-vessel, are examples. The last of 
<A NAME="143"></A>these points to a sub-division that may be made in the class of homogeneous 
<A NAME="144"></A>parts. For in some of them the whole and a portion of the whole in one 
<A NAME="145"></A>sense are designated by the same term-as, for example, is the case with 
<A NAME="146"></A>blood-vessel and bit of blood-vessel-while in another sense they are not; 
<A NAME="147"></A>but a portion of a heterogeneous part, such as face, in no sense has the 
<A NAME="148"></A>same designation as the whole.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>The first question to be asked is what are the causes to which 
<A NAME="150"></A>these homogeneous parts owe their existence? The causes are various; and 
<A NAME="151"></A>this whether the parts be solid or fluid. Thus one set of homogeneous parts 
<A NAME="152"></A>represent the material out of which the heterogeneous parts are formed; 
<A NAME="153"></A>for each separate organ is constructed of bones, sinews, flesh, and the 
<A NAME="154"></A>like; which are either essential elements in its formation, or contribute 
<A NAME="155"></A>to the proper discharge of its function. A second set are the nutriment 
<A NAME="156"></A>of the first, and are invariably fluid, for all growth occurs at the expense 
<A NAME="157"></A>of fluid matter; while a third set are the residue of the second. Such, 
<A NAME="158"></A>for instance, are the faeces and, in animals that have a bladder, the urine; 
<A NAME="159"></A>the former being the dregs of the solid nutriment, the latter of the 
<A NAME="160"></A>fluid.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>Even the individual homogeneous parts present variations, which 
<A NAME="162"></A>are intended in each case to render them more serviceable for their purpose. 
<A NAME="163"></A>The variations of the blood may be selected to illustrate this. For different 
<A NAME="164"></A>bloods differ in their degrees of thinness or thickness, of clearness or 
<A NAME="165"></A>turbidity, of coldness or heat; and this whether we compare the bloods 
<A NAME="166"></A>from different parts of the same individual or the bloods of different 
<A NAME="167"></A>animals. For, in the individual, all the differences just enumerated distinguish 
<A NAME="168"></A>the blood of the upper and of the lower halves of the body; and, dealing 
<A NAME="169"></A>with classes, one section of animals is sanguineous, while the other has 
<A NAME="170"></A>no blood, but only something resembling it in its place. As regards the 
<A NAME="171"></A>results of such differences, the thicker and the hotter blood is, the more 
<A NAME="172"></A>conducive is it to strength, while in proportion to its thinness and its 
<A NAME="173"></A>coldness is its suitability for sensation and intelligence. A like distinction 
<A NAME="174"></A>exists also in the fluid which is analogous to blood. This explains how 
<A NAME="175"></A>it is that bees and other similar creatures are of a more intelligent nature 
<A NAME="176"></A>than many sanguineous animals; and that, of sanguineous animals, those 
<A NAME="177"></A>are the most intelligent whose blood is thin and cold. Noblest of all are 
<A NAME="178"></A>those whose blood is hot, and at the same time thin and clear. For such 
<A NAME="179"></A>are suited alike for the development of courage and of intelligence. Accordingly, 
<A NAME="180"></A>the upper parts are superior in these respects to the lower, the male superior 
<A NAME="181"></A>to the female, and the right side to the left. As with the blood so also 
<A NAME="182"></A>with the other parts, homogeneous and heterogeneous alike. For here also 
<A NAME="183"></A>such variations as occur must be held either to be related to the essential 
<A NAME="184"></A>constitution and mode of life of the several animals, or, in other cases, 
<A NAME="185"></A>to be merely matters of slightly better or slightly worse. Two animals, 
<A NAME="186"></A>for instance, may have eyes. But in one these eyes may be of fluid consistency, 
<A NAME="187"></A>while in the other they are hard; and in one there may be eyelids, in the 
<A NAME="188"></A>other no such appendages. In such a case, the fluid consistency and the 
<A NAME="189"></A>presence of eyelids, which are intended to add to the accuracy of vision, 
<A NAME="190"></A>are differences of degree. As to why all animals must of necessity have 
<A NAME="191"></A>blood or something of a similar character, and what the nature of blood 
<A NAME="192"></A>may be, these are matters which can only be considered when we have first 
<A NAME="193"></A>discussed hot and cold. For the natural properties of many substances are 
<A NAME="194"></A>referable to these two elementary principles; and it is a matter of frequent 
<A NAME="195"></A>dispute what animals or what parts of animals are hot and what cold. For 
<A NAME="196"></A>some maintain that water animals are hotter than such as live on land, 
<A NAME="197"></A>asserting that their natural heat counterbalances the coldness of their 
<A NAME="198"></A>medium; and again, that bloodless animals are hotter than those with blood, 
<A NAME="199"></A>and females than males. Parmenides, for instance, and some others declare 
<A NAME="200"></A>that women are hotter than men, and that it is the warmth and abundance 
<A NAME="201"></A>of their blood which causes their menstrual flow, while Empedocles maintains 
<A NAME="202"></A>the opposite opinion. Again, comparing the blood and the bile, some speak 
<A NAME="203"></A>of the former as hot and of the latter as cold, while others invert the 
<A NAME="204"></A>description. If there be this endless disputing about hot and cold, which 
<A NAME="205"></A>of all things that affect our senses are the most distinct, what are we 
<A NAME="206"></A>to think as to our other sensory impressions?
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>The explanation of the difficulty appears to be that the term 'hotter' 
<A NAME="208"></A>is used in several senses; so that different statements, though in verbal 
<A NAME="209"></A>contradiction with each other, may yet all be more or less true. There 
<A NAME="210"></A>ought, then, to be some clear understanding as to the sense in which natural 
<A NAME="211"></A>substances are to be termed hot or cold, solid or fluid. For it appears 
<A NAME="212"></A>manifest that these are properties on which even life and death are largely 
<A NAME="213"></A>dependent, and that they are moreover the causes of sleep and waking, of 
<A NAME="214"></A>maturity and old age, of health and disease; while no similar influence 
<A NAME="215"></A>belongs to roughness and smoothness, to heaviness and lightness, nor, in 
<A NAME="216"></A>short, to any other such properties of matter. That this should be so is 
<A NAME="217"></A>but in accordance with rational expectation. For hot and cold, solid and 
<A NAME="218"></A>fluid, as was stated in a former treatise, are the foundations of the physical 
<A NAME="219"></A>elements.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>Is then the term hot used in one sense or in many? To answer this 
<A NAME="221"></A>we must ascertain what special effect is attributed to a hotter substance, 
<A NAME="222"></A>and if there be several such, how many these may be. A body then is in 
<A NAME="223"></A>one sense said to be hotter than another, if it impart a greater amount 
<A NAME="224"></A>of heat to an object in contact with it. In a second sense, that is said 
<A NAME="225"></A>to be hotter which causes the keener sensation when touched, and especially 
<A NAME="226"></A>if the sensation be attended with pain. This criterion, however, would 
<A NAME="227"></A>seem sometimes to be a false one; for occasionally it is the idiosyncrasy 
<A NAME="228"></A>of the individual that causes the sensation to be painful. Again, of two 
<A NAME="229"></A>things, that is the hotter which the more readily melts a fusible substance, 
<A NAME="230"></A>or sets on fire an inflammable one. Again, of two masses of one and the 
<A NAME="231"></A>same substance, the larger is said to have more heat than the smaller. 
<A NAME="232"></A>Again, of two bodies, that is said to be the hotter which takes the longer 
<A NAME="233"></A>time in cooling, as also we call that which is rapidly heated hotter than 
<A NAME="234"></A>that which is long about it; as though the rapidity implied proximity and 
<A NAME="235"></A>this again similarity of nature, while the want of rapidity implied distance 
<A NAME="236"></A>and this again dissimilarity of nature. The term hotter is used then in 
<A NAME="237"></A>all the various senses that have been mentioned, and perhaps in still more. 
<A NAME="238"></A>Now it is impossible for one body to be hotter than another in all these 
<A NAME="239"></A>different fashions. Boiling water for instance, though it is more scalding 
<A NAME="240"></A>than flame, yet has no power of burning or melting combustible or fusible 
<A NAME="241"></A>matter, while flame has. So again this boiling water is hotter than a small 
<A NAME="242"></A>fire, and yet gets cold more rapidly and completely. For in fact fire never 
<A NAME="243"></A>becomes cold; whereas water invariably does so. Boiling water, again, is 
<A NAME="244"></A>hotter to the touch than oil; yet it gets cold and solid more rapidly than 
<A NAME="245"></A>this other fluid. Blood, again, is hotter to the touch than either water 
<A NAME="246"></A>or oil, and yet coagulates before them. Iron, again, and stones and other 
<A NAME="247"></A>similar bodies are longer in getting heated than water, but when once heated 
<A NAME="248"></A>burn other substances with a much greater intensity. Another distinction 
<A NAME="249"></A>is this. In some of the bodies which are called hot the heat is derived 
<A NAME="250"></A>from without, while in others it belongs to the bodies themselves; and 
<A NAME="251"></A>it makes a most important difference whether the heat has the former or 
<A NAME="252"></A>the latter origin. For to call that one of two bodies the hotter, which 
<A NAME="253"></A>is possessed of heat, we may almost say, accidentally and not of its own 
<A NAME="254"></A>essence, is very much the same thing as if, finding that some man in a 
<A NAME="255"></A>fever was a musician, one were to say that musicians are hotter than healthy 
<A NAME="256"></A>men. Of that which is hot per se and that which is hot per accidens, the 
<A NAME="257"></A>former is the slower to cool, while not rarely the latter is the hotter 
<A NAME="258"></A>to the touch. The former again is the more burning of the two-flame, for 
<A NAME="259"></A>instance, as compared with boiling water-while the latter, as the boiling 
<A NAME="260"></A>water, which is hot per accidens, is the more heating to the touch. From 
<A NAME="261"></A>all this it is clear that it is no simple matter to decide which of two 
<A NAME="262"></A>bodies is the hotter. For the first may be the hotter in one sense, the 
<A NAME="263"></A>second the hotter in another. Indeed in some of these cases it is impossible 
<A NAME="264"></A>to say simply even whether a thing is hot or not. For the actual substratum 
<A NAME="265"></A>may not itself be hot, but may be hot when coupled witb heat as an attribute, 
<A NAME="266"></A>as would be the case if one attached a single name to hot water or hot 
<A NAME="267"></A>iron. It is after this manner that blood is hot. In such cases, in those, 
<A NAME="268"></A>that is, in which the substratum owes its heat to an external influence, 
<A NAME="269"></A>it is plain that cold is not a mere privation, but an actual 
<A NAME="270"></A>existence.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>There is no knowing but that even fire may be another of these 
<A NAME="272"></A>cases. For the substratum of fire may be smoke or charcoal, and though 
<A NAME="273"></A>the former of these is always hot, smoke being an uprising vapour, yet 
<A NAME="274"></A>the latter becomes cold when its flame is extinguished, as also would oil 
<A NAME="275"></A>and pinewood under similar circumstances. But even substances that have 
<A NAME="276"></A>been burnt nearly all possess some heat, cinders, for example, and ashes, 
<A NAME="277"></A>the dejections also of animals, and, among the excretions, bile; because 
<A NAME="278"></A>some residue of heat has been left in them after their combustion. It is 
<A NAME="279"></A>in another sense that pinewood and fat substances are hot; namely, because 
<A NAME="280"></A>they rapidly assume the actuality of fire.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>Heat appears to cause both coagulation and melting. Now such things 
<A NAME="282"></A>as are formed merely of water are solidified by cold, while such as are 
<A NAME="283"></A>formed of nothing but earth are solidified by fire. Hot substances again 
<A NAME="284"></A>are solidified by cold, and, when they consist chiefly of earth, the process 
<A NAME="285"></A>of solidification is rapid, and the resulting substance is insoluble; but, 
<A NAME="286"></A>when their main constituent is water, the solid matter is again soluble. 
<A NAME="287"></A>What kinds of substances, however, admit of being solidified, and what 
<A NAME="288"></A>are the causes of solidification, are questions that have already been 
<A NAME="289"></A>dealt with more precisely in another treatise.
<A NAME="290"></A><BR><BR>In conclusion, then, seeing that the terms hot and hotter are used 
<A NAME="291"></A>in many different senses, and that no one substance can be hotter than 
<A NAME="292"></A>others in all these senses, we must, when we attribute this character to 
<A NAME="293"></A>an object, add such further statements as that this substance is hotter 
<A NAME="294"></A>per se, though that other is often hotter per accidens; or again, that 
<A NAME="295"></A>this substance is potentially hot, that other actually so; or again, that 
<A NAME="296"></A>this substance is hotter in the sense of causing a greater feeling of heat 
<A NAME="297"></A>when touched, while that other is hotter in the sense of producing flame 
<A NAME="298"></A>and burning. The term hot being used in all these various senses, it plainly 
<A NAME="299"></A>follows that the term cold will also be used with like 
<A NAME="300"></A>ambiguity.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>So much then as to the signification of the terms hot and cold, 
<A NAME="302"></A>hotter and colder.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="303"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>In natural sequence we have next to treat of solid and fluid. These 
<A NAME="305"></A>terms are used in various senses. Sometimes, for instance, they denote 
<A NAME="306"></A>things that are potentially, at other times things that are actually, solid 
<A NAME="307"></A>or fluid. Ice for example, or any other solidified fluid, is spoken of 
<A NAME="308"></A>as being actually and accidentally solid, while potentially and essentially 
<A NAME="309"></A>it is fluid. Similarly earth and ashes and the like, when mixed with water, 
<A NAME="310"></A>are actually and accidentally fluid, but potentially and essentially are 
<A NAME="311"></A>solid. Now separate the constituents in such a mixture and you have on 
<A NAME="312"></A>the one hand the watery components to which its fluidity was due, and these 
<A NAME="313"></A>are both actually and potentially fluid, and on the other hand the earthy 
<A NAME="314"></A>components, and these are in every way solid; and it is to bodies that 
<A NAME="315"></A>are solid in this complete manner that the term 'solid' is most properly 
<A NAME="316"></A>and absolutely applicable. So also the opposite term 'fluld' is strictly 
<A NAME="317"></A>and absolutely applicable to that only which is both potentially and actually 
<A NAME="318"></A>fluid. The same remark applies also to hot bodies and to 
<A NAME="319"></A>cold.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>These distinctions, then, being laid down, it is plain that blood 
<A NAME="321"></A>is essentially hot in so far as that heat is connoted in its name; just 
<A NAME="322"></A>as if boiling water were denoted by a single term, boiling would be connoted 
<A NAME="323"></A>in that term. But the substratum of blood, that which it is in substance 
<A NAME="324"></A>while it is blood in form, is not hot. Blood then in a certain sense is 
<A NAME="325"></A>essentially hot, and in another sense is not so. For heat is included in 
<A NAME="326"></A>the definition of blood, just as whiteness is included in the definition 
<A NAME="327"></A>of a white man, and so far therefore blood is essentially hot. But so far 
<A NAME="328"></A>as blood becomes hot from some external influence, it is not hot 
<A NAME="329"></A>essentially.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>As with hot and cold, so also is it with solid and fluid. We can 
<A NAME="331"></A>therefore understand how some substances are hot and fluid so long as they 
<A NAME="332"></A>remain in the living body, but become perceptibly cold and coagulate so 
<A NAME="333"></A>soon as they are separated from it; while others are hot and consistent 
<A NAME="334"></A>while in the body, but when withdrawn under a change to the opposite condition, 
<A NAME="335"></A>and become cold and fluid. Of the former blood is an example, of the latter 
<A NAME="336"></A>bile; for while blood solidifies when thus separated, yellow bile under 
<A NAME="337"></A>the same circumstances becomes more fluid. We must attribute to such substances 
<A NAME="338"></A>the possession of opposite properties in a greater or less 
<A NAME="339"></A>degree.
<A NAME="340"></A><BR><BR>In what sense, then, the blood is hot and in what sense fluid, 
<A NAME="341"></A>and how far it partakes of the opposite properties, has now been fairly 
<A NAME="342"></A>explained. Now since everything that grows must take nourishment, and nutriment 
<A NAME="343"></A>in all cases consists of fluid and solid substances, and since it is by 
<A NAME="344"></A>the force of heat that these are concocted and changed, it follows that 
<A NAME="345"></A>all living things, animals and plants alike, must on this account, if on 
<A NAME="346"></A>no other, have a natural source of heat. This natural heat, moreover, must 
<A NAME="347"></A>belong to many parts, seeing that the organs by which the various elaborations 
<A NAME="348"></A>of the food are effected are many in number. For first of all there is 
<A NAME="349"></A>the mouth and the parts inside the mouth, on which the first share in the 
<A NAME="350"></A>duty clearly devolves, in such animals at least as live on food which requires 
<A NAME="351"></A>disintegration. The mouth, however, does not actually concoct the food, 
<A NAME="352"></A>but merely facilitates concoction; for the subdivision of the food into 
<A NAME="353"></A>small bits facilitates the action of heat upon it. After the mouth come 
<A NAME="354"></A>the upper and the lower abdominal cavities, and here it is that concoction 
<A NAME="355"></A>is effected by the aid of natural heat. Again, just as there is a channel 
<A NAME="356"></A>for the admission of the unconcocted food into the stomach, namely the 
<A NAME="357"></A>mouth, and in some animals the so-called oesophagus, which is continuous 
<A NAME="358"></A>with the mouth and reaches to the stomach, so must there also be other 
<A NAME="359"></A>and more numerous channels by which the concocted food or nutriment shall 
<A NAME="360"></A>pass out of the stomach and intestines into the body at large, and to which 
<A NAME="361"></A>these cavities shall serve as a kind of manger. For plants get their food 
<A NAME="362"></A>from the earth by means of their roots; and this food is already elaborated 
<A NAME="363"></A>when taken in, which is the reason why plants produce no excrement, the 
<A NAME="364"></A>earth and its heat serving them in the stead of a stomach. But animals, 
<A NAME="365"></A>with scarcely an exception, and conspicuously all such as are capable of 
<A NAME="366"></A>locomotion, are provided with a stomachal sac, which is as it were an internal 
<A NAME="367"></A>substitute for the earth. They must therefore have some instrument which 
<A NAME="368"></A>shall correspond to the roots of plants, with which they may absorb their 
<A NAME="369"></A>food from this sac, so that the proper end of the successive stages of 
<A NAME="370"></A>concoction may at last be attained. The mouth then, its duty done, passes 
<A NAME="371"></A>over the food to the stomach, and there must necessarily be something to 
<A NAME="372"></A>receive it in turn from this. This something is furnished by the bloodvessels, 
<A NAME="373"></A>which run throughout the whole extent of the mesentery from its lowest 
<A NAME="374"></A>part right up to the stomach. A description of these will be found in the 
<A NAME="375"></A>treatises on Anatomy and Natural History. Now as there is a receptacle 
<A NAME="376"></A>for the entire matter taken as food, and also a receptacle for its excremental 
<A NAME="377"></A>residue, and again a third receptacle, namely the vessels, which serve 
<A NAME="378"></A>as such for the blood, it is plain that this blood must be the final nutritive 
<A NAME="379"></A>material in such animals as have it; while in bloodless animals the same 
<A NAME="380"></A>is the case with the fluid which represents the blood. This explains why 
<A NAME="381"></A>the blood diminishes in quantity when no food is taken, and increases when 
<A NAME="382"></A>much is consumed, and also why it becomes healthy and unhealthy according 
<A NAME="383"></A>as the food is of the one or the other character. These facts, then, and 
<A NAME="384"></A>others of a like kind, make it plain that the purpose of the blood in sanguineous 
<A NAME="385"></A>animals is to subserve the nutrition of the body. They also explain why 
<A NAME="386"></A>no more sensation is produced by touching the blood than by touching one 
<A NAME="387"></A>of the excretions or the food, whereas when the flesh is touched sensation 
<A NAME="388"></A>is produced. For the blood is not continuous nor united by growth with 
<A NAME="389"></A>the flesh, but simply lies loose in its receptacle, that is in the heart 
<A NAME="390"></A>and vessels. The manner in which the parts grow at the expense of the blood, 
<A NAME="391"></A>and indeed the whole question of nutrition, will find a more suitable place 
<A NAME="392"></A>for exposition in the treatise on Generation, and in other writings. For 
<A NAME="393"></A>our present purpose all that need be said is that the blood exists for 
<A NAME="394"></A>the sake of nutrition, that is the nutrition of the parts; and with this 
<A NAME="395"></A>much let us therefore content ourselves.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="396"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>What are called fibres are found in the blood of some animals but 
<A NAME="398"></A>not of all. There are none, for instance, in the blood of deer and of roes; 
<A NAME="399"></A>and for this reason the blood of such animals as these never coagulates. 
<A NAME="400"></A>For one part of the blood consists mainly of water and therefore does not 
<A NAME="401"></A>coagulate, this process occurring only in the other and earthy constituent, 
<A NAME="402"></A>that is to say in the fibres, while the fluid part is 
<A NAME="403"></A>evaporating.
<A NAME="404"></A><BR><BR>Some at any rate of the animals with watery blood have a keener 
<A NAME="405"></A>intellect than those whose blood is of an earthier nature. This is due 
<A NAME="406"></A>not to the coldness of their blood, but rather to its thinness and purity; 
<A NAME="407"></A>neither of which qualities belongs to the earthy matter. For the thinner 
<A NAME="408"></A>and purer its fluid is, the more easily affected is an animal's sensibility. 
<A NAME="409"></A>Thus it is that some bloodless animals, notwithstanding their want of blood, 
<A NAME="410"></A>are yet more intelligent than some among the sanguineous kinds. Such for 
<A NAME="411"></A>instance, as already said, is the case with the bee and the tribe of ants, 
<A NAME="412"></A>and whatever other animals there may be of a like nature. At the same time 
<A NAME="413"></A>too great an excess of water makes animals timorous. For fear chills the 
<A NAME="414"></A>body; so that in animals whose heart contains so watery a mixture the way 
<A NAME="415"></A>is prepared for the operation of this emotion. For water is congealed by 
<A NAME="416"></A>cold. This also explains why bloodless animals are, as a general rule, 
<A NAME="417"></A>more timorous than such as have blood, so that they remain motionless, 
<A NAME="418"></A>when frightened, and discharge their excretions, and in some instances 
<A NAME="419"></A>change colour. Such animals, on the other hand, as have thick and abundant 
<A NAME="420"></A>fibres in their blood are of a more earthy nature, and of a choleric temperament, 
<A NAME="421"></A>and liable to bursts of passion. For anger is productive of heat; and solids, 
<A NAME="422"></A>when they have been made hot, give off more heat than fluids. The fibres 
<A NAME="423"></A>therefore, being earthy and solid, are turned into so many hot embers in 
<A NAME="424"></A>the blood, like the embers in a vapour-bath, and cause ebullition in the 
<A NAME="425"></A>fits of passion.
<A NAME="426"></A><BR><BR>This explains why bulls and boars are so choleric and so passionate. 
<A NAME="427"></A>For their blood is exceedingly rich in fibres, and the bull's at any rate 
<A NAME="428"></A>coagulates more rapidly than that of any other animal. If these fibres, 
<A NAME="429"></A>that is to say if the earthy constituents of which we are speaking, are 
<A NAME="430"></A>taken out of the blood, the fluid that remains behind will no longer coagulate; 
<A NAME="431"></A>just as the watery residue of mud will not coagulate after removal of the 
<A NAME="432"></A>earth. But if the fibres are left the fluid coagulates, as also does mud, 
<A NAME="433"></A>under the influence of cold. For when the heat is expelled by the cold, 
<A NAME="434"></A>the fluid, as has been already stated, passes off with it by evaporation, 
<A NAME="435"></A>and the residue is dried up and solidified, not by heat but by cold. So 
<A NAME="436"></A>long, however, as the blood is in the body, it is kept fluid by animal 
<A NAME="437"></A>heat.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>The character of the blood affects both the temperament and the 
<A NAME="439"></A>sensory faculties of animals in many ways. This is indeed what might reasonably 
<A NAME="440"></A>be expected, seeing that the blood is the material of which the whole body 
<A NAME="441"></A>is made. For nutriment supplies the material, and the blood is the ultimate 
<A NAME="442"></A>nutriment. It makes then a considerable difference whether the blood be 
<A NAME="443"></A>hot or cold, thin or thick, turbid or clear.
<A NAME="444"></A><BR><BR>The watery part of the blood is serum; and it is watery, either 
<A NAME="445"></A>owing to its not being yet concocted, or owing to its having become corrupted; 
<A NAME="446"></A>so that one part of the serum is the resultant of a necessary process, 
<A NAME="447"></A>while another part is material intended to serve for the formation of the 
<A NAME="448"></A>blood.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="449"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>The differences between lard and suet correspond to differences 
<A NAME="451"></A>of blood. For both are blood concocted into these forms as a result of 
<A NAME="452"></A>abundant nutrition, being that surplus blood that is not expended on the 
<A NAME="453"></A>fleshy part of the body, and is of an easily concocted and fatty character. 
<A NAME="454"></A>This is shown by the unctuous aspect of these substances; for such unctuous 
<A NAME="455"></A>aspect in fluids is due to a combination of air and fire. It follows from 
<A NAME="456"></A>what has been said that no non-sanguineous animals have either lard or 
<A NAME="457"></A>suet; for they have no blood. Among sanguineous animals those whose blood 
<A NAME="458"></A>is dense have suet rather than lard. For suet is of an earthy nature, that 
<A NAME="459"></A>is to say, it contains but a small proportion of water and is chiefly composed 
<A NAME="460"></A>of earth; and this it is that makes it coagulate, just as the fibrous matter 
<A NAME="461"></A>of blood coagulates, or broths which contain such fibrous matter. Thus 
<A NAME="462"></A>it is that in those horned animals that have no front teeth in the upper 
<A NAME="463"></A>jaw the fat consists of suet. For the very fact that they have horns and 
<A NAME="464"></A>huckle-bones shows that their composition is rich in this earthy element; 
<A NAME="465"></A>for all such appurtenances are solid and earthy in character. On the other 
<A NAME="466"></A>hand in those hornless animals that have front teeth in both jaws, and 
<A NAME="467"></A>whose feet are divided into toes, there is no suet, but in its place lard; 
<A NAME="468"></A>and this, not being of an earthy character, neither coagulates nor dries 
<A NAME="469"></A>up into a friable mass.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>Both lard and suet when present in moderate amount are beneficial; 
<A NAME="471"></A>for they contribute to health and strength, while they are no hindrance 
<A NAME="472"></A>to sensation. But when they are present in great excess, they are injurious 
<A NAME="473"></A>and destructive. For were the whole body formed of them it would perish. 
<A NAME="474"></A>For an animal is an animal in virtue of its sensory part, that is in virtue 
<A NAME="475"></A>of its flesh, or of the substance analogous to flesh. But the blood, as 
<A NAME="476"></A>before stated, is not sensitive; as therefore is neither lard nor suet, 
<A NAME="477"></A>seeing that they are nothing but concocted blood. Were then the whole body 
<A NAME="478"></A>composed of these substances, it would be utterly without sensation. Such 
<A NAME="479"></A>animals, again, as are excessively fat age rapidly. For so much of their 
<A NAME="480"></A>blood is used in forming fat, that they have but little left; and when 
<A NAME="481"></A>there is but little blood the way is already open for decay. For decay 
<A NAME="482"></A>may be said to be deficiency of blood, the scantiness of which renders 
<A NAME="483"></A>it liable, like all bodies of small bulk, to be injuriously affected by 
<A NAME="484"></A>any chance excess of heat or cold. For the same reason fat animals are 
<A NAME="485"></A>less prolific than others. For that part of the blood which should go to 
<A NAME="486"></A>form semen and seed is used up in the production of lard and suet, which 
<A NAME="487"></A>are nothing but concocted blood; so that in these animals there is either 
<A NAME="488"></A>no reproductive excretion at all, or only a scanty amount.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="489"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR>So much then of blood and serum, and of lard and suet. Each of 
<A NAME="491"></A>these has been described, and the purposes told for which they severally 
<A NAME="492"></A>exist. The marrow also is of the nature of blood, and not, as some think, 
<A NAME="493"></A>the germinal force of the semen. That this is the case is quite evident 
<A NAME="494"></A>in very young animals. For in the embryo the marrow of the bones has a 
<A NAME="495"></A>blood-like appearance, which is but natural, seeing that the parts are 
<A NAME="496"></A>all constructed out of blood, and that it is on blood that the embryo is 
<A NAME="497"></A>nourished. But, as the young animal grows up and ripens into maturity, 
<A NAME="498"></A>the marrow changes its colour, just as do the external parts and the viscera. 
<A NAME="499"></A>For the viscera also in animals, so long as they are young, have each and 
<A NAME="500"></A>all a blood-like look, owing to the large amount of this fluid which they 
<A NAME="501"></A>contain.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>The consistency of the marrow agrees with that of the fat. For 
<A NAME="503"></A>when the fat consists of lard, then the marrow also is unctuous and lard-like; 
<A NAME="504"></A>but when the blood is converted by concoction into suet, and does not assume 
<A NAME="505"></A>the form of lard, then the marrow also has a suety character. In those 
<A NAME="506"></A>animals, therefore, that have horns and are without upper front teeth, 
<A NAME="507"></A>the marrow has the character of suet; while it takes the form of lard in 
<A NAME="508"></A>those that have front teeth in both jaws, and that also have the foot divided 
<A NAME="509"></A>into toes. What has ben said hardly applies to the spinal marrow. For it 
<A NAME="510"></A>is necessary that this shall be continuous and extend without break through 
<A NAME="511"></A>the whole backbone, inasmuch as this bone consists of separate vertebrae. 
<A NAME="512"></A>But were the spinal marrow either of unctuous fat or of suet, it could 
<A NAME="513"></A>not hold together in such a continuous mass as it does, but would either 
<A NAME="514"></A>be too fluid or too frangible.
<A NAME="515"></A><BR><BR>There are some animals that can hardly be said to have any marrow. 
<A NAME="516"></A>These are those whose bones are strong and solid, as is the case with the 
<A NAME="517"></A>lion. For in this animal the marrow is so utterly insignificant that the 
<A NAME="518"></A>bones look as though they had none at all. However, as it is necessary 
<A NAME="519"></A>that animals shall have bones or something analogous to them, such as the 
<A NAME="520"></A>fish-spines of water-animals, it is also a matter of necessity that some 
<A NAME="521"></A>of these bones shall contain marrow; for the substance contained within 
<A NAME="522"></A>the bones is the nutriment out of which these are formed. Now the universal 
<A NAME="523"></A>nutriment, as already stated, is blood; and the blood within the bone, 
<A NAME="524"></A>owing to the heat which is developed in it from its being thus surrounded, 
<A NAME="525"></A>undergoes concoction, and self-concocted blood is suet or lard; so that 
<A NAME="526"></A>it is perfectly intelligible how the marrow within the bone comes to have 
<A NAME="527"></A>the character of these substances. So also it is easy to understand why, 
<A NAME="528"></A>in those animals that have strong and compact bones, some of these should 
<A NAME="529"></A>be entirely void of marrow, while the rest contain but little of it; for 
<A NAME="530"></A>here the nutriment is spent in forming the bones.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>Those animals that have fish-spines in place of bones have no other 
<A NAME="532"></A>marrow than that of the chine. For in the first place they have naturally 
<A NAME="533"></A>but a small amount of blood; and secondly the only hollow fish-spine is 
<A NAME="534"></A>that of the chine. In this then marrow is formed; this being the only spine 
<A NAME="535"></A>in which there is space for it, and, moreover, being the only one which 
<A NAME="536"></A>owing to its division into parts requires a connecting bond. This too is 
<A NAME="537"></A>the reason why the marrow of the chine, as already mentioned, is somewhat 
<A NAME="538"></A>different from that of other bones. For, having to act the part of a clasp, 
<A NAME="539"></A>it must be of glutinous character, and at the same time sinewy so as to 
<A NAME="540"></A>admit of stretching.
<A NAME="541"></A><BR><BR>Such then are the reasons for the existence of marrow, in those 
<A NAME="542"></A>animals that have any, and such its nature. It is evidently the surplus 
<A NAME="543"></A>of the sanguineous nutriment apportioned to the bones and fish-spines, 
<A NAME="544"></A>which has undergone concoction owing to its being enclosed within 
<A NAME="545"></A>them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="546"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="547"></A><BR><BR>From the marrow we pass on in natural sequence to the brain. For 
<A NAME="548"></A>there are many who think that the brain itself consists of marrow, and 
<A NAME="549"></A>that it forms the commencement of that substance, because they see that 
<A NAME="550"></A>the spinal marrow is continuous with it. In reality the two may be said 
<A NAME="551"></A>to be utterly opposite to each other in character. For of all the parts 
<A NAME="552"></A>of the body there is none so cold as the brain; whereas the marrow is of 
<A NAME="553"></A>a hot nature, as is plainly shown by its fat and unctuous character. Indeed 
<A NAME="554"></A>this is the very reason why the brain and spinal marrow are continuous 
<A NAME="555"></A>with each other. For, wherever the action of any part is in excess, nature 
<A NAME="556"></A>so contrives as to set by it another part with an excess of contrary action, 
<A NAME="557"></A>so that the excesses of the two may counterbalance each other. Now that 
<A NAME="558"></A>the marrow is hot is clearly shown by many indications. The coldness of 
<A NAME="559"></A>the brain is also manifest enough. For in the first place it is cold even 
<A NAME="560"></A>to the touch; and, secondly, of all the fluid parts of the body it is the 
<A NAME="561"></A>driest and the one that has the least blood; for in fact it has no blood 
<A NAME="562"></A>at all in its proper substance. This brain is not residual matter, nor 
<A NAME="563"></A>yet is it one of the parts which are anatomically continuous with each 
<A NAME="564"></A>other; but it has a character peculiar to itself, as might indeed be expected. 
<A NAME="565"></A>That it has no continuity with the organs of sense is plain from simple 
<A NAME="566"></A>inspection, and is still more clearly shown by the fact, that, when it 
<A NAME="567"></A>is touched, no sensation is produced; in which respect it resembles the 
<A NAME="568"></A>blood of animals and their excrement. The purpose of its presence in animals 
<A NAME="569"></A>is no less than the preservation of the whole body. For some writers assert 
<A NAME="570"></A>that the soul is fire or some such force. This, however, is but a rough 
<A NAME="571"></A>and inaccurate assertion; and it would perhaps be better to say that the 
<A NAME="572"></A>soul is incorporate in some substance of a fiery character. The reason 
<A NAME="573"></A>for this being so is that of all substances there is none so suitable for 
<A NAME="574"></A>ministering to the operations of the soul as that which is possessed of 
<A NAME="575"></A>heat. For nutrition and the imparting of motion are offices of the soul, 
<A NAME="576"></A>and it is by heat that these are most readily effected. To say then that 
<A NAME="577"></A>the soul is fire is much the same thing as to confound the auger or the 
<A NAME="578"></A>saw with the carpenter or his craft, simply because the work is wrought 
<A NAME="579"></A>by the two in conjunction. So far then this much is plain, that all animals 
<A NAME="580"></A>must necessarily have a certain amount of heat. But as all influences require 
<A NAME="581"></A>to be counterbalanced, so that they may be reduced to moderation and brought 
<A NAME="582"></A>to the mean (for in the mean, and not in either extreme, lies the true 
<A NAME="583"></A>and rational position), nature has contrived the brain as a counterpoise 
<A NAME="584"></A>to the region of the heart with its contained heat, and has given it to 
<A NAME="585"></A>animals to moderate the latter, combining in it the properties of earth 
<A NAME="586"></A>and water. For this reason it is, that every sanguineous animal has a brain; 
<A NAME="587"></A>whereas no bloodless creature has such an organ, unless indeed it be, as 
<A NAME="588"></A>the Poulp, by analogy. For where there is no blood, there in consequence 
<A NAME="589"></A>there is but little heat. The brain, then, tempers the heat and seething 
<A NAME="590"></A>of the heart. In order, however, that it may not itself be absolutely without 
<A NAME="591"></A>heat, but may have a moderate amount, branches run from both blood-vessels, 
<A NAME="592"></A>that is to say from the great vessel and from what is called the aorta, 
<A NAME="593"></A>and end in the membrane which surrounds the brain; while at the same time, 
<A NAME="594"></A>in order to prevent any injury from the heat, these encompassing vessels, 
<A NAME="595"></A>instead of being few and large, are numerous and small, and their blood 
<A NAME="596"></A>scanty and clear, instead of being abundant and thick. We can now understand 
<A NAME="597"></A>why defluxions have their origin in the head, and occur whenever the parts 
<A NAME="598"></A>about the brain have more than a due proportion of coldness. For when the 
<A NAME="599"></A>nutriment steams upwards through the blood-vessels, its refuse portion 
<A NAME="600"></A>is chilled by the influence of this region, and forms defluxions of phlegm 
<A NAME="601"></A>and serum. We must suppose, to compare small things with great, that the 
<A NAME="602"></A>like happens here as occurs in the production of showers. For when vapour 
<A NAME="603"></A>steams up from the earth and is carried by the heat into the upper regions, 
<A NAME="604"></A>so soon as it reaches the cold air that is above the earth, it condenses 
<A NAME="605"></A>again into water owing to the refrigeration, and falls back to the earth 
<A NAME="606"></A>as rain. These, however, are matters which may be suitably considered in 
<A NAME="607"></A>the Principles of Diseases, so far as natural philosophy has anything to 
<A NAME="608"></A>say to them.
<A NAME="609"></A><BR><BR>It is the brain again-or, in animals that have no brain, the part 
<A NAME="610"></A>analogous to it-which is the cause of sleep. For either by chilling the 
<A NAME="611"></A>blood that streams upwards after food, or by some other similar influences, 
<A NAME="612"></A>it produces heaviness in the region in which it lies (which is the reason 
<A NAME="613"></A>why drowsy persons hang the head), and causes the heat to escape downwards 
<A NAME="614"></A>in company with the blood. It is the accumulation of this in excess in 
<A NAME="615"></A>the lower region that produces complete sleep, taking away the power of 
<A NAME="616"></A>standing upright from those animals to whom that posture is natural, and 
<A NAME="617"></A>from the rest the power of holding up the head. These, however, are matters 
<A NAME="618"></A>which have been separately considered in the treatises on Sensation and 
<A NAME="619"></A>on Sleep.
<A NAME="620"></A><BR><BR>That the brain is a compound of earth and water is shown by what 
<A NAME="621"></A>occurs when it is boiled. For, when so treated, it turns hard and solid, 
<A NAME="622"></A>inasmuch as the water is evaporated by the heat, and leaves the earthy 
<A NAME="623"></A>part behind. Just the same occurs when pulse and other fruits are boiled. 
<A NAME="624"></A>For these also are hardened by the process, because the water which enters 
<A NAME="625"></A>into their composition is driven off and leaves the earth, which is their 
<A NAME="626"></A>main constituent, behind.
<A NAME="627"></A><BR><BR>Of all animals, man has the largest brain in proportion to his 
<A NAME="628"></A>size; and it is larger in men than in women. This is because the region 
<A NAME="629"></A>of the heart and of the lung is hotter and richer in blood in man than 
<A NAME="630"></A>in any other animal; and in men than in women. This again explains why 
<A NAME="631"></A>man, alone of animals, stands erect. For the heat, overcoming any opposite 
<A NAME="632"></A>inclination, makes growth take its own line of direction, which is from 
<A NAME="633"></A>the centre of the body upwards. It is then as a counterpoise to his excessive 
<A NAME="634"></A>heat that in man's brain there is this superabundant fluidity and coldness; 
<A NAME="635"></A>and it is again owing to this superabundance that the cranial bone, which 
<A NAME="636"></A>some call the Bregma, is the last to become solidified; so long does evaporation 
<A NAME="637"></A>continue to occur through it under the influence of heat. Man is the only 
<A NAME="638"></A>sanguineous animal in which this takes place. Man, again, has more sutures 
<A NAME="639"></A>in his skull than any other animal, and the male more than the female. 
<A NAME="640"></A>The explanation is again to be found in the greater size of the brain, 
<A NAME="641"></A>which demands free ventilation, proportionate to its bulk. For if the brain 
<A NAME="642"></A>be either too fluid or too solid, it will not perform its office, but in 
<A NAME="643"></A>the one case will freeze the blood, and in the other will not cool it at 
<A NAME="644"></A>all; and thus will cause disease, madness, and death. For the cardiac heat 
<A NAME="645"></A>and the centre of life is most delicate in its sympathies, and is immediately 
<A NAME="646"></A>sensitive to the slightest change or affection of the blood on the outer 
<A NAME="647"></A>surface of the brain.
<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR>The fluids which are present in the animal body at the time of 
<A NAME="649"></A>birth have now nearly all been considered. Amongst those that appear only 
<A NAME="650"></A>at a later period are the residua of the food, which include the deposits 
<A NAME="651"></A>of the belly and also those of the bladder. Besides these there is the 
<A NAME="652"></A>semen and the milk, one or the other of which makes its appearance in appropriate 
<A NAME="653"></A>animals. Of these fluids the excremental residua of the food may be suitably 
<A NAME="654"></A>discussed by themselves, when we come to examine and consider the subject 
<A NAME="655"></A>of nutrition. Then will be the time to explain in what animals they are 
<A NAME="656"></A>found, and what are the reasons for their presence. Similarly all questions 
<A NAME="657"></A>concerning the semen and the milk may be dealt with in the treatise on 
<A NAME="658"></A>Generation, for the former of these fluids is the very starting-point of 
<A NAME="659"></A>the generative process, and the latter has no other ground of existence 
<A NAME="660"></A>than generative purposes.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="661"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>We have now to consider the remaining homogeneous parts, and will 
<A NAME="663"></A>begin with flesh, and with the substance that, in animals that have no 
<A NAME="664"></A>flesh, takes its place. The reason for so beginning is that flesh forms 
<A NAME="665"></A>the very basis of animals, and is the essential constituent of their body. 
<A NAME="666"></A>Its right to this precedence can also be demonstrated logically. For an 
<A NAME="667"></A>animal is by our definition something that has sensibility and chief of 
<A NAME="668"></A>all the primary sensibility, which is that of Touch; and it is the flesh, 
<A NAME="669"></A>or analogous substance, which is the organ of this sense. And it is the 
<A NAME="670"></A>organ, either in the same way as the pupil is the organ of sight, that 
<A NAME="671"></A>is it constitutes the primary organ of the sense; or it is the organ and 
<A NAME="672"></A>the medium through which the object acts combined, that is it answers to 
<A NAME="673"></A>the pupil with the whole transparent medium attached to it. Now in the 
<A NAME="674"></A>case of the other senses it was impossible for nature to unite the medium 
<A NAME="675"></A>with the sense-organ, nor would such a junction have served any purpose; 
<A NAME="676"></A>but in the case of touch she was compelled by necessity to do so. For of 
<A NAME="677"></A>all the sense-organs that of touch is the only one that has corporeal substance, 
<A NAME="678"></A>or at any rate it is more corporeal than any other, and its medium must 
<A NAME="679"></A>be corporeal like itself.
<A NAME="680"></A><BR><BR>It is obvious also to sense that it is for the sake of the flesh 
<A NAME="681"></A>that all the other parts exist. By the other parts I mean the bones, the 
<A NAME="682"></A>skin, the sinews, and the blood-vessels, and, again, the hair and the various 
<A NAME="683"></A>kinds of nails, and anything else there may be of a like character. Thus 
<A NAME="684"></A>the bones are a contrivance to give security to the soft parts, to which 
<A NAME="685"></A>purpose they are adapted by their hardness; and in animals that have no 
<A NAME="686"></A>bones the same office is fulfilled by some analogous substance, as by fishspine 
<A NAME="687"></A>in some fishes, and by cartilage in others.
<A NAME="688"></A><BR><BR>Now in some animals this supporting substance is situated within 
<A NAME="689"></A>the body, while in some of the bloodless species it is placed on the outside. 
<A NAME="690"></A>The latter is the case in all the Crustacea, as the Carcini (Crabs) and 
<A NAME="691"></A>the Carabi (Prickly Lobsters); it is the case also in the Testacea, as 
<A NAME="692"></A>for instance in the several species known by the general name of oysters. 
<A NAME="693"></A>For in all these animals the fleshy substance is within, and the earthy 
<A NAME="694"></A>matter, which holds the soft parts together and keeps them from injury, 
<A NAME="695"></A>is on the outside. For the shell not only enables the soft parts to hold 
<A NAME="696"></A>together, but also, as the animal is bloodless and so has but little natural 
<A NAME="697"></A>warmth, surrounds it, as a chaufferette does the embers, and keeps in the 
<A NAME="698"></A>smouldering heat. Similar to this seems to be the arrangement in another 
<A NAME="699"></A>and distinct tribe of animals, namely the Tortoises, including the Chelone 
<A NAME="700"></A>and the several kinds of Emys. But in Insects and in Cephalopods the plan 
<A NAME="701"></A>is entirely different, there being moreover a contrast between these two 
<A NAME="702"></A>themselves. For in neither of these does there appear to be any bony or 
<A NAME="703"></A>earthy part, worthy of notice, distinctly separated from the rest of the 
<A NAME="704"></A>body. Thus in the Cephalopods the main bulk of the body consists of a soft 
<A NAME="705"></A>flesh-like substance, or rather of a substance which is intermediate to 
<A NAME="706"></A>flesh and sinew, so as not to be so readily destructible as actual flesh. 
<A NAME="707"></A>I call this substance intermediate to flesh and sinew, because it is soft 
<A NAME="708"></A>like the former, while it admits of stretching like the latter. Its cleavage, 
<A NAME="709"></A>however, is such that it splits not longitudinally, like sinew, but into 
<A NAME="710"></A>circular segments, this being the most advantageous condition, so far as 
<A NAME="711"></A>strength is concerned. These animals have also a part inside them corresponding 
<A NAME="712"></A>to the spinous bones of fishes. For instance, in the Cuttle-fishes there 
<A NAME="713"></A>is what is known as the os sepiae, and in the Calamaries there is the so-called 
<A NAME="714"></A>gladius. In the Poulps, on the other hand, there is no such internal part, 
<A NAME="715"></A>because the body, or, as it is termed in them, the head, forms but a short 
<A NAME="716"></A>sac, whereas it is of considerable length in the other two; and it was 
<A NAME="717"></A>this length which led nature to assign to them their hard support, so as 
<A NAME="718"></A>to ensure their straightness and inflexibility; just as she has assigned 
<A NAME="719"></A>to sanguineous animals their bones or their fish-spines, as the case may 
<A NAME="720"></A>be. To come now to Insects. In these the arrangement is quite different 
<A NAME="721"></A>from that of the Cephalopods; quite different also from that which obtains 
<A NAME="722"></A>in sanguineous animals, as indeed has been already stated. For in an insect 
<A NAME="723"></A>there is no distinction into soft and hard parts, but the whole body is 
<A NAME="724"></A>hard, the hardness, however, being of such a character as to be more flesh-like 
<A NAME="725"></A>than bone, and more earthy and bone-like than flesh. The purpose of this 
<A NAME="726"></A>is to make the body of the insect less liable to get broken into 
<A NAME="727"></A>pieces.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="728"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>There is a resemblance between the osseous and the vascular systems; 
<A NAME="730"></A>for each has a central part in which it begins, and each forms a continuous 
<A NAME="731"></A>whole. For no bone in the body exists as a separate thing in itself, but 
<A NAME="732"></A>each is either a portion of what may be considered a continuous whole, 
<A NAME="733"></A>or at any rate is linked with the rest by contact and by attachments; so 
<A NAME="734"></A>that nature may use adjoining bones either as though they were actually 
<A NAME="735"></A>continuous and formed a single bone, or, for purposes of flexure, as though 
<A NAME="736"></A>they were two and distinct. And similarly no blood-vessel has in itself 
<A NAME="737"></A>a separate individuality; but they all form parts of one whole. For an 
<A NAME="738"></A>isolated bone, if such there were, would in the first place be unable to 
<A NAME="739"></A>perform the office for the sake of which bones exist; for, were it discontinuous 
<A NAME="740"></A>and separated from the rest by a gap, it would be perfectly unable to produce 
<A NAME="741"></A>either flexure or extension; nor only so, but it would actually be injurious, 
<A NAME="742"></A>acting like a thorn or an arrow lodged in the flesh. Similarly if a vessel 
<A NAME="743"></A>were isolated, and not continuous with the vascular centre, it would be 
<A NAME="744"></A>unable to retain the blood within it in a proper state. For it is the warmth 
<A NAME="745"></A>derived from this centre that hinders the blood from coagulating; indeed 
<A NAME="746"></A>the blood, when withdrawn from its influence, becomes manifestly putrid. 
<A NAME="747"></A>Now the centre or origin of the blood-vessels is the heart, and the centre 
<A NAME="748"></A>or origin of the bones, in all animals that have bones, is what is called 
<A NAME="749"></A>the chine. With this all the other bones of the body are in continuity; 
<A NAME="750"></A>for it is the chine that holds together the whole length of an animal and 
<A NAME="751"></A>preserves its straightness. But since it is necessary that the body of 
<A NAME="752"></A>an animal shall bend during locomotion, this chine, while it is one in 
<A NAME="753"></A>virtue of the continuity of its parts, yet its division into vertebrae 
<A NAME="754"></A>is made to consist of many segments. It is from this chine that the bones 
<A NAME="755"></A>of the limbs, in such animals as have these parts, proceed, and with it 
<A NAME="756"></A>they are continuous, being fastened together by the sinews where the limbs 
<A NAME="757"></A>admit of flexure, and having their extremities adapted to each other, either 
<A NAME="758"></A>by the one being hollowed and the other rounded, or by both being hollowed 
<A NAME="759"></A>and including between them a hucklebone, as a connecting bolt, so as to 
<A NAME="760"></A>allow of flexure and extension. For without some such arrangement these 
<A NAME="761"></A>movements would be utterly impossible, or at any rate would be performed 
<A NAME="762"></A>with great difficulty. There are some joints, again, in which the lower 
<A NAME="763"></A>end of the one bone and the upper end of the other are alike in shape. 
<A NAME="764"></A>In these cases the bones are bound together by sinews, and cartilaginous 
<A NAME="765"></A>pieces are interposed in the joint, to serve as a kind of padding, and 
<A NAME="766"></A>prevent the two extremities from grating against each 
<A NAME="767"></A>other.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR><BR>Round about the bones, and attached to them by thin fibrous bands, 
<A NAME="769"></A>grow the fleshy parts, for the sake of which the bones themselves exist. 
<A NAME="770"></A>For just as an artist, when he is moulding an animal out of clay or other 
<A NAME="771"></A>soft substance, takes first some solid body as a basis, and round this 
<A NAME="772"></A>moulds the clay, so also has nature acted in fashioning the animal body 
<A NAME="773"></A>out of flesh. Thus we find all the fleshy parts, with one exception, supported 
<A NAME="774"></A>by bones, which serve, when the parts are organs of motion, to facilitate 
<A NAME="775"></A>flexure, and, when the parts are motionless, act as a protection. The ribs, 
<A NAME="776"></A>for example, which enclose the chest are intended to ensure the safety 
<A NAME="777"></A>of the heart and neighbouring viscera. The exception of which mention was 
<A NAME="778"></A>made is the belly. The walls of this are in all animals devoid of bones; 
<A NAME="779"></A>in order that there may be no hindrance to the expansion which necessarily 
<A NAME="780"></A>occurs in this part after a meal, nor, in females, any interference with 
<A NAME="781"></A>the growth of the foetus, which is lodged here.
<A NAME="782"></A><BR><BR>Now the bones of viviparous animals, of such, that is, as are not 
<A NAME="783"></A>merely externally but also internally viviparous, vary but very little 
<A NAME="784"></A>from each other in point of strength, which in all of them is considerable. 
<A NAME="785"></A>For the Vivipara in their bodily proportions are far above other animals, 
<A NAME="786"></A>and many of them occasionally grow to an enormous size, as is the case 
<A NAME="787"></A>in Libya and in hot and dry countries generally. But the greater the bulk 
<A NAME="788"></A>of an animal, the stronger, the bigger, and the harder, are the supports 
<A NAME="789"></A>which it requires; and comparing the big animals with each other, this 
<A NAME="790"></A>requirement will be most marked in those that live a life of rapine. Thus 
<A NAME="791"></A>it is that the bones of males are harder than those of females; and the 
<A NAME="792"></A>bones of flesh-eaters, that get their food by fighting, are harder than 
<A NAME="793"></A>those of Herbivora. Of this the Lion is an example; for so hard are its 
<A NAME="794"></A>bones, that, when struck, they give off sparks, as though they were stones. 
<A NAME="795"></A>It may be mentioned also that the Dolphin, in as much as it is viviparous, 
<A NAME="796"></A>is provided with bones and not with fish-spines.
<A NAME="797"></A><BR><BR>In those sanguineous animals, on the other hand, that are oviparous, 
<A NAME="798"></A>the bones present successive slight variations of character. Thus in Birds 
<A NAME="799"></A>there are bones, but these are not so strong as the bones of the Vivipara. 
<A NAME="800"></A>Then come the Oviparous fishes, where there is no bone, but merely fish-spine. 
<A NAME="801"></A>In the Serpents too the bones have the character of fish-spine, excepting 
<A NAME="802"></A>in the very large species, where the solid foundation of the body requires 
<A NAME="803"></A>to be stronger, in order that the animal itself may be strong, the same 
<A NAME="804"></A>reason prevailing as in the case of the Vivipara. Lastly, in the Selachia, 
<A NAME="805"></A>as they are called, the fish-spines are replaced by cartilage. For it is 
<A NAME="806"></A>necessary that the movements of these animals shall be of an undulating 
<A NAME="807"></A>character; and this again requires the framework that supports the body 
<A NAME="808"></A>to be made of a pliable and not of a brittle substance. Moreover, in these 
<A NAME="809"></A>Selachia nature has used all the earthy matter on the skin; and she is 
<A NAME="810"></A>unable to allot to many different parts one and the same superfluity of 
<A NAME="811"></A>material. Even in viviparous animals many of the bones are cartilaginous. 
<A NAME="812"></A>This happens in those parts where it is to the advantage of the surrounding 
<A NAME="813"></A>flesh that its solid base shall be soft and mucilaginous. Such, for instance, 
<A NAME="814"></A>is the case with the ears and nostrils; for in projecting parts, such as 
<A NAME="815"></A>these, brittle substances would soon get broken. Cartilage and bone are 
<A NAME="816"></A>indeed fundamentally the same thing, the differences between them being 
<A NAME="817"></A>merely matters of degree. Thus neither cartilage nor bone, when once cut 
<A NAME="818"></A>off, grows again. Now the cartilages of these land animals are without 
<A NAME="819"></A>marrow, that is without any distinctly separate marrow. For the marrow, 
<A NAME="820"></A>which in bones is distinctly separate, is here mixed up with the whole 
<A NAME="821"></A>mass, and gives a soft and mucilaginous consistence to the cartilage. But 
<A NAME="822"></A>in the Selachia the chine, though it is cartilaginous, yet contains marrow; 
<A NAME="823"></A>for here it stands in the stead of a bone.
<A NAME="824"></A><BR><BR>Very nearly resembling the bones to the touch are such parts as 
<A NAME="825"></A>nails, hoofs, whether solid or cloven, horns, and the beaks of birds, all 
<A NAME="826"></A>of which are intended to serve as means of defence. For the organs which 
<A NAME="827"></A>are made out of these substances, and which are called by the same names 
<A NAME="828"></A>as the substances themselves, the organ hoof, for instance, and the organ 
<A NAME="829"></A>horn, are contrivances to ensure the preservation of the animals to which 
<A NAME="830"></A>they severally belong. In this class too must be reckoned the teeth, which 
<A NAME="831"></A>in some animals have but a single function, namely the mastication of the 
<A NAME="832"></A>food, while in others they have an additional office, namely to serve as 
<A NAME="833"></A>weapons; as is the case with all animals that have sharp interfitting teeth 
<A NAME="834"></A>or that have tusks. All these parts are necessarily of solid and earthy 
<A NAME="835"></A>character; for the value of a weapon depends on such properties. Their 
<A NAME="836"></A>earthy character explains how it is that all such parts are more developed 
<A NAME="837"></A>in four-footed vivipara than in man. For there is always more earth in 
<A NAME="838"></A>the composition of these animals than in that of the human body. However, 
<A NAME="839"></A>not only all these parts but such others as are nearly connected with them, 
<A NAME="840"></A>skin for instance, bladder, membrane, hairs, feathers, and their analogues, 
<A NAME="841"></A>and any other similar parts that there may be, will be considered farther 
<A NAME="842"></A>on with the heterogeneous parts. There we shall inquire into the causes 
<A NAME="843"></A>which produce them, and into the objects of their presence severally in 
<A NAME="844"></A>the bodies of animals. For, as with the heterogeneous parts, so with these, 
<A NAME="845"></A>it is from a consideration of their functions that alone we can derive 
<A NAME="846"></A>any knowledge of them. The reason for dealing with them at all in this 
<A NAME="847"></A>part of the treatise, and classifying them with the homogeneous parts, 
<A NAME="848"></A>is that under one and the same name are confounded the entire organs and 
<A NAME="849"></A>the substances of which they are composed. But of all these substances 
<A NAME="850"></A>flesh and bone form the basis. Semen and milk were also passed over when 
<A NAME="851"></A>we were considering the homogeneous fluids. For the treatise on Generation 
<A NAME="852"></A>will afford a more suitable place for their examination, seeing that the 
<A NAME="853"></A>former of the two is the very foundation of the thing generated, while 
<A NAME="854"></A>the latter is its nourishment.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="855"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="856"></A><BR><BR>Let us now make, as it were, a fresh beginning, and consider the 
<A NAME="857"></A>heterogeneous parts, taking those first which are the first in importance. 
<A NAME="858"></A>For in all animals, at least in all the perfect kinds, there are two parts 
<A NAME="859"></A>more essential than the rest, namely the part which serves for the ingestion 
<A NAME="860"></A>of food, and the part which serves for the discharge of its residue. For 
<A NAME="861"></A>without food growth and even existence is impossible. Intervening again 
<A NAME="862"></A>between these two parts there is invariably a third, in which is lodged 
<A NAME="863"></A>the vital principle. As for plants, though they also are included by us 
<A NAME="864"></A>among things that have life, yet are they without any part for the discharge 
<A NAME="865"></A>of waste residue. For the food which they absorb from the ground is already 
<A NAME="866"></A>concocted, and they give off as its equivalent their seeds and fruits. 
<A NAME="867"></A>Plants, again, inasmuch as they are without locomotion, present no great 
<A NAME="868"></A>variety in their heterogeneous parts. For, where the functions are but 
<A NAME="869"></A>few, few also are the organs required to effect them. The configuration 
<A NAME="870"></A>of plants is a matter then for separate consideration. Animals, however, 
<A NAME="871"></A>that not only live but feel, present a greater multiformity of parts, and 
<A NAME="872"></A>this diversity is greater in some animals than in others, being most varied 
<A NAME="873"></A>in those to whose share has fallen not mere life but life of high degree. 
<A NAME="874"></A>Now such an animal is man. For of all living beings with which we are acquainted 
<A NAME="875"></A>man alone partakes of the divine, or at any rate partakes of it in a fuller 
<A NAME="876"></A>measure than the rest. For this reason, then, and also because his external 
<A NAME="877"></A>parts and their forms are more familiar to us than those of other animals, 
<A NAME="878"></A>we must speak of man first; and this the more fitly, because in him alone 
<A NAME="879"></A>do the natural parts hold the natural position; his upper part being turned 
<A NAME="880"></A>towards that which is upper in the universe. For, of all animals, man alone 
<A NAME="881"></A>stands erect.
<A NAME="882"></A><BR><BR>In man, then, the head is destitute of flesh; this being the necessary 
<A NAME="883"></A>consequence of what has already been stated concerning the brain. There 
<A NAME="884"></A>are, indeed, some who hold that the life of man-would be longer than it 
<A NAME="885"></A>is, were his head more abundantly furnished with flesh; and they account 
<A NAME="886"></A>for the absence of this substance by saying that it is intended to add 
<A NAME="887"></A>to the perfection of sensation. For the brain they assert to be the organ 
<A NAME="888"></A>of sensation; and sensation, they say, cannot penetrate to parts that are 
<A NAME="889"></A>too thickly covered with flesh. But neither part of this statement is true. 
<A NAME="890"></A>On the contrary, were the region of the brain thickly covered with flesh, 
<A NAME="891"></A>the very purpose for which animals are provided with a brain would be directly 
<A NAME="892"></A>contravened. For the brain would itself be heated to excess and so unable 
<A NAME="893"></A>to cool any other part; and, as to the other half of their statement, the 
<A NAME="894"></A>brain cannot be the cause of any of the sensations, seeing that it is itself 
<A NAME="895"></A>as utterly without feeling as any one of the excretions. These writers 
<A NAME="896"></A>see that certain of the senses are located in the head, and are unable 
<A NAME="897"></A>to discern the reason for this; they see also that the brain is the most 
<A NAME="898"></A>peculiar of all the animal organs; and out of these facts they form an 
<A NAME="899"></A>argument, by which they link sensation and brain together. It has, however, 
<A NAME="900"></A>already been clearly set forth in the treatise on Sensation, that it is 
<A NAME="901"></A>the region of the heart that constitutes the sensory centre. There also 
<A NAME="902"></A>it was stated that two of the senses, namely touch and taste, are manifestly 
<A NAME="903"></A>in immediate connexion with the heart; and that as regards the other three, 
<A NAME="904"></A>namely hearing, sight, and the centrally placed sense of smell, it is the 
<A NAME="905"></A>character of their sense-organs which causes them to be lodged as a rule 
<A NAME="906"></A>in the head. Vision is so placed in all animals. But such is not invariably 
<A NAME="907"></A>the case with hearing or with smell. For fishes and the like hear and smell, 
<A NAME="908"></A>and yet have no visible organs for these senses in the head; a fact which 
<A NAME="909"></A>demonstrates the accuracy of the opinion here maintained. Now that vision, 
<A NAME="910"></A>whenever it exists, should be in the neighbourhood of the brain is but 
<A NAME="911"></A>what one would rationally expect. For the brain is fluid and cold, and 
<A NAME="912"></A>vision is of the nature of water, water being of all transparent substances 
<A NAME="913"></A>the one most easily confined. Moreover it cannot but necessarily be that 
<A NAME="914"></A>the more precise senses will have their precision rendered still greater 
<A NAME="915"></A>if ministered to by parts that have the purest blood. For the motion of 
<A NAME="916"></A>the heat of blood destroys sensory activity. For these reasons the organs 
<A NAME="917"></A>of the precise senses are lodged in the head.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR><BR>It is not only the fore part of the head that is destitute of flesh, 
<A NAME="919"></A>but the hind part also. For, in all animals that have a head, it is this 
<A NAME="920"></A>head which more than any other part requires to be held up. But, were the 
<A NAME="921"></A>head heavily laden with flesh, this would be impossible; for nothing so 
<A NAME="922"></A>burdened can be held upright. This is an additional proof that the absence 
<A NAME="923"></A>of flesh from the head has no reference to brain sensation. For there is 
<A NAME="924"></A>no brain in the hinder part of the head, and yet this is as much without 
<A NAME="925"></A>flesh as is the front.
<A NAME="926"></A><BR><BR>In some animals hearing as well as vision is lodged in the region 
<A NAME="927"></A>of the head. Nor is this without a rational explanation. For what is called 
<A NAME="928"></A>the empty space is full of air, and the organ of hearing is, as we say, 
<A NAME="929"></A>of the nature of air. Now there are channels which lead from the eyes to 
<A NAME="930"></A>the blood-vessels that surround the brain; and similarly there is a channel 
<A NAME="931"></A>which leads back again from each ear and connects it with the hinder part 
<A NAME="932"></A>of the head. But no part that is without blood is endowed with sensation, 
<A NAME="933"></A>as neither is the blood itself, but only some one of the parts that are 
<A NAME="934"></A>formed of blood.
<A NAME="935"></A><BR><BR>The brain in all animals that have one is placed in the front part 
<A NAME="936"></A>of the head; because the direction in which sensation acts is in front; 
<A NAME="937"></A>and because the heart, from which sensation proceeds, is in the front part 
<A NAME="938"></A>of the body; and lastly because the instruments of sensation are the blood-containing 
<A NAME="939"></A>parts, and the cavity in the posterior part of the skull is destitute of 
<A NAME="940"></A>blood-vessels.
<A NAME="941"></A><BR><BR>As to the position of the sense-organs, they have been arranged 
<A NAME="942"></A>by nature in the following well-ordered manner. The organs of hearing are 
<A NAME="943"></A>so placed as to divide the circumference of the head into two equal halves; 
<A NAME="944"></A>for they have to hear not only sounds which are directly in line with themselves, 
<A NAME="945"></A>but sounds from all quarters. The organs of vision are placed in front, 
<A NAME="946"></A>because sight is exercised only in a straight line, and moving as we do 
<A NAME="947"></A>in a forward direction it is necessary that we should see before us, in 
<A NAME="948"></A>the direction of our motion. Lastly, the organs of smell are placed with 
<A NAME="949"></A>good reason between the eyes. For as the body consists of two parts, a 
<A NAME="950"></A>right half and a left, so also each organ of sense is double. In the case 
<A NAME="951"></A>of touch this is not apparent, the reason being that the primary organ 
<A NAME="952"></A>of this sense is not the flesh or analogous part, but lies internally. 
<A NAME="953"></A>In the case of taste, which is merely a modification of touch and which 
<A NAME="954"></A>is placed in the tongue, the fact is more apparent than in the case of 
<A NAME="955"></A>touch, but still not so manifest as in the case of the other senses. However, 
<A NAME="956"></A>even in taste it is evident enough; for in some animals the tongue is plainly 
<A NAME="957"></A>forked. The double character of the sensations is, however, more conspicuous 
<A NAME="958"></A>in the other organs of sense. For there are two ears and two eyes, and 
<A NAME="959"></A>the nostrils, though joined together, are also two. Were these latter otherwise 
<A NAME="960"></A>disposed, and separated from each other as are the ears, neither they nor 
<A NAME="961"></A>the nose in which they are placed would be able to perform their office. 
<A NAME="962"></A>For in such animals as have nostrils olfaction is effected by means of 
<A NAME="963"></A>inspiration, and the organ of inspiration is placed in front and in the 
<A NAME="964"></A>middle line. This is the reason why nature has brought the two nostrils 
<A NAME="965"></A>together and placed them as the central of the three sense-organs, setting 
<A NAME="966"></A>them side by side on a level with each other, to avail themselves of the 
<A NAME="967"></A>inspiratory motion. In other animals than man the arrangement of these 
<A NAME="968"></A>sense-organs is also such as is adapted in each case to the special 
<A NAME="969"></A>requirements.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="970"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="971"></A><BR><BR>For instance, in quadrupeds the ears stand out freely from the 
<A NAME="972"></A>head and are set to all appearance above the eyes. Not that they are in 
<A NAME="973"></A>reality above the eyes; but they seem to be so, because the animal does 
<A NAME="974"></A>not stand erect, but has its head hung downwards. This being the usual 
<A NAME="975"></A>attitude of the animal when in motion, it is of advantage that its ears 
<A NAME="976"></A>shall be high up and movable; for by turning themselves about they can 
<A NAME="977"></A>the better take in sounds from every quarter.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="978"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="979"></A><BR><BR>In birds, on the other hand, there are no ears, but only the auditory 
<A NAME="980"></A>passages. This is because their skin is hard and because they have feathers 
<A NAME="981"></A>instead of hairs, so that they have not got the proper material for the 
<A NAME="982"></A>formation of ears. Exactly the same is the case with such oviparous quadrupeds 
<A NAME="983"></A>as are clad with scaly plates, and the same explanation applies to them. 
<A NAME="984"></A>There is also one of the viviparous quadrupeds, namely the seal, that has 
<A NAME="985"></A>no ears but only the auditory passages. The explanation of this is that 
<A NAME="986"></A>the seal, though a quadruped, is a quadruped of stunted 
<A NAME="987"></A>formation.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="988"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="989"></A><BR><BR>Men, and Birds, and Quadrupeds, viviparous and oviparous alike, 
<A NAME="990"></A>have their eyes protected by lids. In the Vivipara there are two of these; 
<A NAME="991"></A>and both are used by these animals not only in closing the eyes, but also 
<A NAME="992"></A>in the act of blinking; whereas the oviparous quadrupeds, and the heavy-bodied 
<A NAME="993"></A>birds as well as some others, use only the lower lid to close the eye; 
<A NAME="994"></A>while birds blink by means of a membrane that issues from the canthus. 
<A NAME="995"></A>The reason for the eyes being thus protected is that nature has made them 
<A NAME="996"></A>of fluid consistency, in order to ensure keenness of vision. For had they 
<A NAME="997"></A>been covered with hard skin, they would, it is true, have been less liable 
<A NAME="998"></A>to get injured by anything falling into them from without, but they would 
<A NAME="999"></A>not have been sharp-sighted. It is then to ensure keenness of vision that 
<A NAME="1000"></A>the skin over the pupil is fine and delicate; while the lids are superadded 
<A NAME="1001"></A>as a protection from injury. It is as a still further safeguard that all 
<A NAME="1002"></A>these animals blink, and man most of all; this action (which is not performed 
<A NAME="1003"></A>from deliberate intention but from a natural instinct) serving to keep 
<A NAME="1004"></A>objects from falling into the eyes; and being more frequent in man than 
<A NAME="1005"></A>in the rest of these animals, because of the greater delicacy of his skin. 
<A NAME="1006"></A>These lids are made of a roll of skin; and it is because they are made 
<A NAME="1007"></A>of skin and contain no flesh that neither they, nor the similarly constructed 
<A NAME="1008"></A>prepuce, unite again when once cut.
<A NAME="1009"></A><BR><BR>As to the oviparous quadrupeds, and such birds as resemble them 
<A NAME="1010"></A>in closing the eye with the lower lid, it is the hardness of the skin of 
<A NAME="1011"></A>their heads which makes them do so. For such birds as have heavy bodies 
<A NAME="1012"></A>are not made for flight; and so the materials which would otherwise have 
<A NAME="1013"></A>gone to increase the growth of the feathers are diverted thence, and used 
<A NAME="1014"></A>to augment the thickness of the skin. Birds therefore of this kind close 
<A NAME="1015"></A>the eye with the lower lid; whereas pigeons and the like use both upper 
<A NAME="1016"></A>and lower lids for the purpose. As birds are covered with feathers, so 
<A NAME="1017"></A>oviparous quadrupeds are covered with scaly plates; and these in all their 
<A NAME="1018"></A>forms are harder than hairs, so that the skin also to which they belong 
<A NAME="1019"></A>is harder than the skin of hairy animals. In these animals, then, the skin 
<A NAME="1020"></A>on the head is hard, and so does not allow of the formation of an upper 
<A NAME="1021"></A>eyelid, whereas lower down the integument is of a flesh-like character, 
<A NAME="1022"></A>so that the lower lid can be thin and extensible.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR><BR>The act of blinking is performed by the heavy-bodied birds by means 
<A NAME="1024"></A>of the membrane already mentioned, and not by this lower lid. For in blinking 
<A NAME="1025"></A>rapid motion is required, and such is the motion of this membrane, whereas 
<A NAME="1026"></A>that of the lower lid is slow. It is from the canthus that is nearest to 
<A NAME="1027"></A>the nostrils that the membrane comes. For it is better to have one starting-point 
<A NAME="1028"></A>for nictitation than two; and in these birds this starting-point is the 
<A NAME="1029"></A>junction of eye and nostrils, an anterior starting-point being preferable 
<A NAME="1030"></A>to a lateral one. Oviparous quadrupeds do not blink in like manner as the 
<A NAME="1031"></A>birds; for, living as they do on the ground, they are free from the necessity 
<A NAME="1032"></A>of having eyes of fluid consistency and of keen sight, whereas these are 
<A NAME="1033"></A>essential requisites for birds, inasmuch as they have to use their eyes 
<A NAME="1034"></A>at long distances. This too explains why birds with talons, that have to 
<A NAME="1035"></A>search for prey by eye from aloft, and therefore soar to greater heights 
<A NAME="1036"></A>than other birds, are sharpsighted; while common fowls and the like, that 
<A NAME="1037"></A>live on the ground and are not made for flight, have no such keenness of 
<A NAME="1038"></A>vision. For there is nothing in their mode of life which imperatively requires 
<A NAME="1039"></A>it.
<A NAME="1040"></A><BR><BR>Fishes and Insects and the hard-skinned Crustacea present certain 
<A NAME="1041"></A>differences in their eyes, but so far resemble each other as that none 
<A NAME="1042"></A>of them have eyelids. As for the hard-skinned Crustacea it is utterly out 
<A NAME="1043"></A>of the question that they should have any; for an eyelid, to be of use, 
<A NAME="1044"></A>requires the action of the skin to be rapid. These animals then have no 
<A NAME="1045"></A>eyelids and, in default of this protection, their eyes are hard, just as 
<A NAME="1046"></A>though the lid were attached to the surface of the eye, and the animal 
<A NAME="1047"></A>saw through it. Inasmuch, however, as such hardness must necessarily blunt 
<A NAME="1048"></A>the sharpness of vision, nature has endowed the eyes of Insects, and still 
<A NAME="1049"></A>more those of Crustacea, with mobility (just as she has given some quadrupeds 
<A NAME="1050"></A>movable ears), in order that they may be able to turn to the light and 
<A NAME="1051"></A>catch its rays, and so see more plainly. Fishes, however, have eyes of 
<A NAME="1052"></A>a fluid consistency. For animals that move much about have to use their 
<A NAME="1053"></A>vision at considerable distances. If now they live on land, the air in 
<A NAME="1054"></A>which they move is transparent enough. But the water in which fishes live 
<A NAME="1055"></A>is a hindrance to sharp sight, though it has this advantage over the air, 
<A NAME="1056"></A>that it does not contain so many objects to knock against the eyes. The 
<A NAME="1057"></A>risk of collision being thus small, nature, who makes nothing in vain, 
<A NAME="1058"></A>has given no eyelids to fishes, while to counterbalance the opacity of 
<A NAME="1059"></A>the water she has made their eyes of fluid consistency.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1060"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="1061"></A><BR><BR>All animals that have hairs on the body have lashes on the eyelids; 
<A NAME="1062"></A>but birds and animals with scale-like plates, being hairless, have none. 
<A NAME="1063"></A>The Libyan ostrich, indeed, forms an exception; for, though a bird, it 
<A NAME="1064"></A>is furnished with eyelashes. This exception, however, will be explained 
<A NAME="1065"></A>hereafter. Of hairy animals, man alone has lashes on both lids. For in 
<A NAME="1066"></A>quadrupeds there is a greater abundance of hair on the back than on the 
<A NAME="1067"></A>under side of the body; whereas in man the contrary is the case, and the 
<A NAME="1068"></A>hair is more abundant on the front surface than on the back. The reason 
<A NAME="1069"></A>for this is that hair is intended to serve as a protection to its possessor. 
<A NAME="1070"></A>Now, in quadrupeds, owing to their inclined attitude, the under or anterior 
<A NAME="1071"></A>surface does not require so much protection as the back, and is therefore 
<A NAME="1072"></A>left comparatively bald, in spite of its being the nobler of the two sides. 
<A NAME="1073"></A>But in man, owing to his upright attitude, the anterior and posterior surfaces 
<A NAME="1074"></A>of the body are on an equality as regards need of protection. Nature therefore 
<A NAME="1075"></A>has assigned the protective covering to the nobler of the two surfaces; 
<A NAME="1076"></A>for invariably she brings about the best arrangement of such as are possible. 
<A NAME="1077"></A>This then is the reason that there is no lower eyelash in any quadruped; 
<A NAME="1078"></A>though in some a few scattered hairs sprout out under the lower lid. This 
<A NAME="1079"></A>also is the reason that they never have hair in the axillae, nor on the 
<A NAME="1080"></A>pubes, as man has. Their hair, then, instead of being collected in these 
<A NAME="1081"></A>parts, is either thickly set over the whole dorsal surface, as is the case 
<A NAME="1082"></A>for instance in dogs, or, sometimes, forms a mane, as in horses and the 
<A NAME="1083"></A>like, or as in the male lion where the mane is still more flowing and ample. 
<A NAME="1084"></A>So, again, whenever there is a tail of any length, nature decks it with 
<A
