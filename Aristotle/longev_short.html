<BR><BR>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>

<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>The reasons for some animals being long-lived and others short-lived, and, 
<A NAME="12"></A>in a word, causes of the length and brevity of life call for 
<A NAME="13"></A>investigation.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>The necessary beginning to our inquiry is a statement of the difficulties 
<A NAME="15"></A>about these points. For it is not clear whether in animals and plants universally 
<A NAME="16"></A>it is a single or diverse cause that makes some to be long-lived, others 
<A NAME="17"></A>short-lived. Plants too have in some cases a long life, while in others 
<A NAME="18"></A>it lasts but for a year.
<A NAME="19"></A><BR><BR>Further, in a natural structure are longevity and a sound constitution 
<A NAME="20"></A>coincident, or is shortness of life independent of unhealthiness? Perhaps 
<A NAME="21"></A>in the case of certain maladies a diseased state of the body and shortness 
<A NAME="22"></A>of life are interchangeable, while in the case of others ill-health is 
<A NAME="23"></A>perfectly compatible with long life.
<A NAME="24"></A><BR><BR>Of sleep and waking we have already treated; about life and death 
<A NAME="25"></A>we shall speak later on, and likewise about health and disease, in so far 
<A NAME="26"></A>as it belongs to the science of nature to do so. But at present we have 
<A NAME="27"></A>to investigate the causes of some creatures being long-lived, and others 
<A NAME="28"></A>short-lived. We find this distinction affecting not only entire genera 
<A NAME="29"></A>opposed as wholes to one another, but applying also to contrasted sets 
<A NAME="30"></A>of individuals within the same species. As an instance of the difference 
<A NAME="31"></A>applying to the genus I give man and horse (for mankind has a longer life 
<A NAME="32"></A>than the horse), while within the species there is the difference between 
<A NAME="33"></A>man and man; for of men also some are long-lived, others short-lived, differing 
<A NAME="34"></A>from each other in respect of the different regions in which they dwell. 
<A NAME="35"></A>Races inhabiting warm countries have longer life, those living in a cold 
<A NAME="36"></A>climate live a shorter time. Likewise there are similar differences among 
<A NAME="37"></A>individuals occupying the same locality.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="38"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>In order to find premisses for our argument, we must answer the 
<A NAME="40"></A>question, What is that which, in natural objects, makes them easily destroyed, 
<A NAME="41"></A>or the reverse? Since fire and water, and whatsoever is akin thereto, do 
<A NAME="42"></A>not possess identical powers they are reciprocal causes of generation and 
<A NAME="43"></A>decay. Hence it is natural to infer that everything else arising from them 
<A NAME="44"></A>and composed of them should share in the same nature, in all cases where 
<A NAME="45"></A>things are not, like a house, a composite unity formed by the synthesis 
<A NAME="46"></A>of many things.
<A NAME="47"></A><BR><BR>In other matters a different account must be given; for in many 
<A NAME="48"></A>things their mode of dissolution is something peculiar to themselves, e.g. 
<A NAME="49"></A>in knowledge and health and disease. These pass away even though the medium 
<A NAME="50"></A>in which they are found is not destroyed but continues to exist; for example, 
<A NAME="51"></A>take the termination of ignorance, which is recollection or learning, while 
<A NAME="52"></A>knowledge passes away into forgetfulness, or error. But accidentally the 
<A NAME="53"></A>disintegration of a natural object is accompanied by the destruction of 
<A NAME="54"></A>the non-physical reality; for, when the animal dies, the health or knowledge 
<A NAME="55"></A>resident in it passes away too. Hence from these considerations we may 
<A NAME="56"></A>draw a conclusion about the soul too; for, if the inherence of soul in 
<A NAME="57"></A>body is not a matter of nature but like that of knowledge in the soul, 
<A NAME="58"></A>there would be another mode of dissolution pertaining to it besides that 
<A NAME="59"></A>which occurs when the body is destroyed. But since evidently it does not 
<A NAME="60"></A>admit of this dual dissolution, the soul must stand in a different case 
<A NAME="61"></A>in respect of its union with the body.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="62"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="63"></A><BR><BR>Perhaps one might reasonably raise the question whether there is 
<A NAME="64"></A>any place where what is corruptible becomes incorruptible, as fire does 
<A NAME="65"></A>in the upper regions where it meets with no opposite. Opposites destroy 
<A NAME="66"></A>each other, and hence accidentally, by their destruction, whatsoever is 
<A NAME="67"></A>attributed to them is destroyed. But no opposite in a real substance is 
<A NAME="68"></A>accidentally destroyed, because real substance is not predicated of any 
<A NAME="69"></A>subject. Hence a thing which has no opposite, or which is situated where 
<A NAME="70"></A>it has no opposite, cannot be destroyed. For what will that be which can 
<A NAME="71"></A>destroy it, if destruction comes only through contraries, but no contrary 
<A NAME="72"></A>to it exists either absolutely or in the particular place where it is? 
<A NAME="73"></A>But perhaps this is in one sense true, in another sense not true, for it 
<A NAME="74"></A>is impossible that anything containing matter should not have in any sense 
<A NAME="75"></A>an opposite. Heat and straightness can be present in every part of a thing, 
<A NAME="76"></A>but it is impossible that the thing should be nothing but hot or white 
<A NAME="77"></A>or straight; for, if that were so, attributes would have an independent 
<A NAME="78"></A>existence. Hence if, in all cases, whenever the active and the passive 
<A NAME="79"></A>exist together, the one acts and the other is acted on, it is impossible 
<A NAME="80"></A>that no change should occur. Further, this is so if a waste product is 
<A NAME="81"></A>an opposite, and waste must always be produced; for opposition is always 
<A NAME="82"></A>the source of change, and refuse is what remains of the previous opposite. 
<A NAME="83"></A>But, after expelling everything of a nature actually opposed, would an 
<A NAME="84"></A>object in this case also be imperishable? No, it would be destroyed by 
<A NAME="85"></A>the environment.
<A NAME="86"></A><BR><BR>If then that is so, what we have said sufficiently accounts for 
<A NAME="87"></A>the change; but, if not, we must assume that something of actually opposite 
<A NAME="88"></A>character is in the changing object, and refuse is produced.
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>Hence accidentally a lesser flame is consumed by a greater one, 
<A NAME="90"></A>for the nutriment, to wit the smoke, which the former takes a long period 
<A NAME="91"></A>to expend, is used up by the big flame quickly.
<A NAME="92"></A><BR><BR>Hence [too] all things are at all times in a state of transition 
<A NAME="93"></A>and are coming into being and passing away. The environment acts on them 
<A NAME="94"></A>either favourably or antagonistically, and, owing to this, things that 
<A NAME="95"></A>change their situation become more or less enduring than their nature warrants, 
<A NAME="96"></A>but never are they eternal when they contain contrary qualities; for their 
<A NAME="97"></A>matter is an immediate source of contrariety, so that if it involves locality 
<A NAME="98"></A>they show change of situation, if quantity, increase and diminution, while 
<A NAME="99"></A>if it involves qualitative affection we find alteration of 
<A NAME="100"></A>character.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="101"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="102"></A><BR><BR>We find that a superior immunity from decay attaches neither to 
<A NAME="103"></A>the largest animals (the horse has shorter life than man) nor to those 
<A NAME="104"></A>that are small (for most insects live but for a year). Nor are plants as 
<A NAME="105"></A>a whole less liable to perish than animals (many plants are annuals), nor 
<A NAME="106"></A>have sanguineous animals the pre-eminence (for the bee is longer-lived 
<A NAME="107"></A>than certain sanguineous animals). Neither is it the bloodless animals 
<A NAME="108"></A>that live longest (for molluscs live only a year, though bloodless), nor 
<A NAME="109"></A>terrestrial organisms (there are both plants and terrestrial animals of 
<A NAME="110"></A>which a single year is the period), nor the occupants of the sea (for there 
<A NAME="111"></A>we find the crustaceans and the molluscs, which are 
<A NAME="112"></A>short-lived).
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>Speaking generally, the longest-lived things occur among the plants, 
<A NAME="114"></A>e.g. the date-palm. Next in order we find them among the sanguineous animals 
<A NAME="115"></A>rather than among the bloodless, and among those with feet rather than 
<A NAME="116"></A>among the denizens of the water. Hence, taking these two characters together, 
<A NAME="117"></A>the longest-lived animals fall among sanguineous animals which have feet, 
<A NAME="118"></A>e.g. man and elephant. As a matter of fact also it is a general rule that 
<A NAME="119"></A>the larger live longer than the smaller, for the other long-lived animals 
<A NAME="120"></A>too happen to be of a large size, as are also those I have 
<A NAME="121"></A>mentioned.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="122"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="123"></A><BR><BR>The following considerations may enable us to understand the reasons 
<A NAME="124"></A>for all these facts. We must remember that an animal is by nature humid 
<A NAME="125"></A>and warm, and to live is to be of such a constitution, while old age is 
<A NAME="126"></A>dry and cold, and so is a corpse. This is plain to observation. But the 
<A NAME="127"></A>material constituting the bodies of all things consists of the following-the 
<A NAME="128"></A>hot and the cold, the dry and the moist. Hence when they age they must 
<A NAME="129"></A>become dry, and therefore the fluid in them requires to be not easily dried 
<A NAME="130"></A>up. Thus we explain why fat things are not liable to decay. The reason 
<A NAME="131"></A>is that they contain air; now air relatively to the other elements is fire, 
<A NAME="132"></A>and fire never becomes corrupted.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>Again the humid element in animals must not be small in quantity, 
<A NAME="134"></A>for a small quantity is easily dried up. This is why both plants and animals 
<A NAME="135"></A>that are large are, as a general rule, longer-lived than the rest, as was 
<A NAME="136"></A>said before; it is to be expected that the larger should contain more moisture. 
<A NAME="137"></A>But it is not merely this that makes them longer lived; for the cause is 
<A NAME="138"></A>twofold, to wit, the quality as well as the quantity of the fluid. Hence 
<A NAME="139"></A>the moisture must be not only great in amount but also warm, in order to 
<A NAME="140"></A>be neither easily congealed nor easily dried up.
<A NAME="141"></A><BR><BR>It is for this reason also that man lives longer than some animals 
<A NAME="142"></A>which are larger; for animals live longer though there is a deficiency 
<A NAME="143"></A>in the amount of their moisture, if the ratio of its qualitative superiority 
<A NAME="144"></A>exceeds that of its quantitative deficiency.
<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>In some creatures the warm element is their fatty substance, which 
<A NAME="146"></A>prevents at once desiccation and congelation; but in others it assumes 
<A NAME="147"></A>a different flavour. Further, that which is designed to be not easily destroyed 
<A NAME="148"></A>should not yield waste products. Anything of such a nature causes death 
<A NAME="149"></A>either by disease or naturally, for the potency of the waste product works 
<A NAME="150"></A>adversely and destroys now the entire constitution, now a particular 
<A NAME="151"></A>member.
<A NAME="152"></A><BR><BR>This is why salacious animals and those abounding in seed age quickly; 
<A NAME="153"></A>the seed is a residue, and further, by being lost, it produces dryness. 
<A NAME="154"></A>Hence the mule lives longer than either the horse or the ass from which 
<A NAME="155"></A>it sprang, and females live longer than males if the males are salacious. 
<A NAME="156"></A>Accordingly cock-sparrows have a shorter life than the females. Again males 
<A NAME="157"></A>subject to great toil are short-lived and age more quickly owing to the 
<A NAME="158"></A>labour; toil produces dryness and old age is dry. But by natural constitution 
<A NAME="159"></A>and as a general rule males live longer than females, and the reason is 
<A NAME="160"></A>that the male is an animal with more warmth than the 
<A NAME="161"></A>female.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>The same kind of animals are longer-lived in warm than in cold 
<A NAME="163"></A>climates for the same reason, on account of which they are of larger size. 
<A NAME="164"></A>The size of animals of cold constitution illustrates this particularly 
<A NAME="165"></A>well, and hence snakes and lizards and scaly reptiles are of great size 
<A NAME="166"></A>in warm localities, as also are testacea in the Red Sea: the warm humidity 
<A NAME="167"></A>there is the cause equally of their augmented size and of their life. But 
<A NAME="168"></A>in cold countries the humidity in animals is more of a watery nature, and 
<A NAME="169"></A>hence is readily congealed. Consequently it happens that animals with little 
<A NAME="170"></A>or no blood are in northerly regions either entirely absent (both the land 
<A NAME="171"></A>animals with feet and the water creatures whose home is the sea) or, when 
<A NAME="172"></A>they do occur, they are smaller and have shorter life; for the frost prevents 
<A NAME="173"></A>growth.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>Both plants and animals perish if not fed, for in that case they 
<A NAME="175"></A>consume themselves; just as a large flame consumes and burns up a small 
<A NAME="176"></A>one by using up its nutriment, so the natural warmth which is the primary 
<A NAME="177"></A>cause of digestion consumes the material in which it is 
<A NAME="178"></A>located.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR>Water animals have a shorter life than terrestrial creatures, not 
<A NAME="180"></A>strictly because they are humid, but because they are watery, and watery 
<A NAME="181"></A>moisture is easily destroyed, since it is cold and readily congealed. For 
<A NAME="182"></A>the same reason bloodless animals perish readily unless protected by great 
<A NAME="183"></A>size, for there is neither fatness nor sweetness about them. In animals 
<A NAME="184"></A>fat is sweet, and hence bees are longer-lived than other animals of larger 
<A NAME="185"></A>size.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="186"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>It is amongst the plants that we find the longest life-more than 
<A NAME="188"></A>among the animals, for, in the first place, they are less watery and hence 
<A NAME="189"></A>less easily frozen. Further they have an oiliness and a viscosity which 
<A NAME="190"></A>makes them retain their moisture in a form not easily dried up, even though 
<A NAME="191"></A>they are dry and earthy.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>But we must discover the reason why trees are of an enduring constitution, 
<A NAME="193"></A>for it is peculiar to them and is not found in any animals except the 
<A NAME="194"></A>insects.
<A NAME="195"></A><BR><BR>Plants continually renew themselves and hence last for a long time. 
<A NAME="196"></A>New shoots continually come and the others grow old, and with the roots 
<A NAME="197"></A>the same thing happens. But both processes do not occur together. Rather 
<A NAME="198"></A>it happens that at one time the trunk and the branches alone die and new 
<A NAME="199"></A>ones grow up beside them, and it is only when this has taken place that 
<A NAME="200"></A>the fresh roots spring from the surviving part. Thus it continues, one 
<A NAME="201"></A>part dying and the other growing, and hence also it lives a long 
<A NAME="202"></A>time.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>There is a similarity, as has been already said, between plants 
<A NAME="204"></A>and insects, for they live, though divided, and two or more may be derived 
<A NAME="205"></A>from a single one. Insects, however, though managing to live, are not able 
<A NAME="206"></A>to do so long, for they do not possess organs; nor can the principle resident 
<A NAME="207"></A>in each of the separated parts create organs. In the case of a plant, however, 
<A NAME="208"></A>it can do so; every part of a plant contains potentially both root and 
<A NAME="209"></A>stem. Hence it is from this source that issues that continued growth when 
<A NAME="210"></A>one part is renewed and the other grows old; it is practically a case of 
<A NAME="211"></A>longevity. The taking of slips furnishes a similar instance, for we might 
<A NAME="212"></A>say that, in a way, when we take a slip the same thing happens; the shoot 
<A NAME="213"></A>cut off is part of the plant. Thus in taking slips this perpetuation of 
<A NAME="214"></A>life occurs though their connexion with the plant is severed, but in the 
<A NAME="215"></A>former case it is the continuity that is operative. The reason is that 
<A NAME="216"></A>the life principle potentially belonging to them is present in every 
<A NAME="217"></A>part.
<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>Identical phenomena are found both in plants and in animals. For 
<A NAME="219"></A>in animals the males are, in general, the longer-lived. They have their 
<A NAME="220"></A>upper parts larger than the lower (the male is more of the dwarf type of 
<A NAME="221"></A>build than the female), and it is in the upper part that warmth resides, 
<A NAME="222"></A>in the lower cold. In plants also those with great heads are longer-lived, 
<A NAME="223"></A>and such are those that are not annual but of the tree-type, for the roots 
<A NAME="224"></A>are the head and upper part of a plant, and among the annuals growth occurs 
<A NAME="225"></A>in the direction of their lower parts and the fruit.
<A NAME="226"></A><BR><BR>These matters however will be specially investigated in the work 
<A NAME="227"></A>On Plants. But this is our account of the reasons for the duration of life 
<A NAME="228"></A>and for short life in animals. It remains for us to discuss youth and age, 
<A NAME="229"></A>and life and death. To come to a definite understanding about these matters 
<A NAME="230"></A>would complete our course of study on animals.
