<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>"WE must reckon up the results arising from what has been said, 
<A NAME="13"></A>and compute the sum of them, and put the finishing touch to our inquiry. 
<A NAME="14"></A>We have said that the causes, principles, and elements of substances are 
<A NAME="15"></A>the object of our search. And some substances are recognized by every one, 
<A NAME="16"></A>but some have been advocated by particular schools. Those generally recognized 
<A NAME="17"></A>are the natural substances, i.e. fire, earth, water, air, &c., the simple 
<A NAME="18"></A>bodies; second plants and their parts, and animals and the parts of animals; 
<A NAME="19"></A>and finally the physical universe and its parts; while some particular 
<A NAME="20"></A>schools say that Forms and the objects of mathematics are substances. But 
<A NAME="21"></A>there are arguments which lead to the conclusion that there are other substances, 
<A NAME="22"></A>the essence and the substratum. Again, in another way the genus seems more 
<A NAME="23"></A>substantial than the various spccies, and the universal than the particulars. 
<A NAME="24"></A>And with the universal and the genus the Ideas are connected; it is in 
<A NAME="25"></A>virtue of the same argument that they are thought to be substances. And 
<A NAME="26"></A>since the essence is substance, and the definition is a formula of the 
<A NAME="27"></A>essence, for this reason we have discussed definition and essential predication. 
<A NAME="28"></A>Since the definition is a formula, and a formula has parts, we had to consider 
<A NAME="29"></A>also with respect to the notion of 'part', what are parts of the substance 
<A NAME="30"></A>and what are not, and whether the parts of the substance are also parts 
<A NAME="31"></A>of the definition. Further, too, neither the universal nor the genus is 
<A NAME="32"></A>a substance; we must inquire later into the Ideas and the objects of mathematics; 
<A NAME="33"></A>for some say these are substances as well as the sensible substances. <BR><BR>"But 
<A NAME="34"></A>now let us resume the discussion of the generally recognized substances. 
<A NAME="35"></A>These are the sensible substances, and sensible substances all have matter. 
<A NAME="36"></A>The substratum is substance, and this is in one sense the matter (and by 
<A NAME="37"></A>matter I mean that which, not being a 'this' actually, is potentially a 
<A NAME="38"></A>'this'), and in another sense the formula or shape (that which being a 
<A NAME="39"></A>'this' can be separately formulated), and thirdly the complex of these 
<A NAME="40"></A>two, which alone is generated and destroyed, and is, without qualification, 
<A NAME="41"></A>capable of separate existence; for of substances completely expressible 
<A NAME="42"></A>in a formula some are separable and some are separable and some are not. 
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>"But clearly matter also is substance; for in all the opposite 
<A NAME="44"></A>changes that occur there is something which underlies the changes, e.g. 
<A NAME="45"></A>in respect of place that which is now here and again elsewhere, and in 
<A NAME="46"></A>respect of increase that which is now of one size and again less or greater, 
<A NAME="47"></A>and in respect of alteration that which is now healthy and again diseased; 
<A NAME="48"></A>and similarly in respect of substance there is something that is now being 
<A NAME="49"></A>generated and again being destroyed, and now underlies the process as a 
<A NAME="50"></A>'this' and again underlies it in respect of a privation of positive character. 
<A NAME="51"></A>And in this change the others are involved. But in either one or two of 
<A NAME="52"></A>the others this is not involved; for it is not necessary if a thing has 
<A NAME="53"></A>matter for change of place that it should also have matter for generation 
<A NAME="54"></A>and destruction. <BR><BR>"The difference between becoming in the full sense 
<A NAME="55"></A>and becoming in a qualified sense has been stated in our physical 
<A NAME="56"></A>works.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="57"></A><B>Part 2</B>
<A NAME="58"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="59"></A><BR><BR>"Since the substance which exists as underlying and as matter is 
<A NAME="60"></A>generally recognized, and this that which exists potentially, it remains 
<A NAME="61"></A>for us to say what is the substance, in the sense of actuality, of sensible 
<A NAME="62"></A>things. Democritus seems to think there are three kinds of difference between 
<A NAME="63"></A>things; the underlying body, the matter, is one and the same, but they 
<A NAME="64"></A>differ either in rhythm, i.e. shape, or in turning, i.e. position, or in 
<A NAME="65"></A>inter-contact, i.e. order. But evidently there are many differences; for 
<A NAME="66"></A>instance, some things are characterized by the mode of composition of their 
<A NAME="67"></A>matter, e.g. the things formed by blending, such as honey-water; and others 
<A NAME="68"></A>by being bound together, e.g. bundle; and others by being glued together, 
<A NAME="69"></A>e.g. a book; and others by being nailed together, e.g. a casket; and others 
<A NAME="70"></A>in more than one of these ways; and others by position, e.g. threshold 
<A NAME="71"></A>and lintel (for these differ by being placed in a certain way); and others 
<A NAME="72"></A>by time, e.g. dinner and breakfast; and others by place, e.g. the winds; 
<A NAME="73"></A>and others by the affections proper to sensible things, e.g. hardness and 
<A NAME="74"></A>softness, density and rarity, dryness and wetness; and some things by some 
<A NAME="75"></A>of these qualities, others by them all, and in general some by excess and 
<A NAME="76"></A>some by defect. Clearly, then, the word 'is' has just as many meanings; 
<A NAME="77"></A>a thing is a threshold because it lies in such and such a position, and 
<A NAME="78"></A>its being means its lying in that position, while being ice means having 
<A NAME="79"></A>been solidified in such and such a way. And the being of some things will 
<A NAME="80"></A>be defined by all these qualities, because some parts of them are mixed, 
<A NAME="81"></A>others are blended, others are bound together, others are solidified, and 
<A NAME="82"></A>others use the other differentiae; e.g. the hand or the foot requires such 
<A NAME="83"></A>complex definition. We must grasp, then, the kinds of differentiae (for 
<A NAME="84"></A>these will be the principles of the being of things), e.g. the things characterized 
<A NAME="85"></A>by the more and the less, or by the dense and the rare, and by other such 
<A NAME="86"></A>qualities; for all these are forms of excess and defect. And anything that 
<A NAME="87"></A>is characterized by shape or by smoothness and roughness is characterized 
<A NAME="88"></A>by the straight and the curved. And for other things their being will mean 
<A NAME="89"></A>their being mixed, and their not being will mean the opposite. <BR><BR>"It 
<A NAME="90"></A>is clear, then, from these facts that, since its substance is the cause 
<A NAME="91"></A>of each thing's being, we must seek in these differentiae what is the cause 
<A NAME="92"></A>of the being of each of these things. Now none of these differentiae is 
<A NAME="93"></A>substance, even when coupled with matter, yet it is what is analogous to 
<A NAME="94"></A>substance in each case; and as in substances that which is predicated of 
<A NAME="95"></A>the matter is the actuality itself, in all other definitions also it is 
<A NAME="96"></A>what most resembles full actuality. E.g. if we had to define a threshold, 
<A NAME="97"></A>we should say 'wood or stone in such and such a position', and a house 
<A NAME="98"></A>we should define as 'bricks and timbers in such and such a position',(or 
<A NAME="99"></A>a purpose may exist as well in some cases), and if we had to define ice 
<A NAME="100"></A>we should say 'water frozen or solidified in such and such a way', and 
<A NAME="101"></A>harmony is 'such and such a blending of high and low'; and similarly in 
<A NAME="102"></A>all other cases. <BR><BR>"Obviously, then, the actuality or the formula 
<A NAME="103"></A>is different when the matter is different; for in some cases it is the 
<A NAME="104"></A>composition, in others the mixing, and in others some other of the attributes 
<A NAME="105"></A>we have named. And so, of the people who go in for defining, those who 
<A NAME="106"></A>define a house as stones, bricks, and timbers are speaking of the potential 
<A NAME="107"></A>house, for these are the matter; but those who propose 'a receptacle to 
<A NAME="108"></A>shelter chattels and living beings', or something of the sort, speak of 
<A NAME="109"></A>the actuality. Those who combine both of these speak of the third kind 
<A NAME="110"></A>of substance, which is composed of matter and form (for the formula that 
<A NAME="111"></A>gives the differentiae seems to be an account of the form or actuality, 
<A NAME="112"></A>while that which gives the components is rather an account of the matter); 
<A NAME="113"></A>and the same is true of the kind of definitions which Archytas used to 
<A NAME="114"></A>accept; they are accounts of the combined form and matter. E.g. what is 
<A NAME="115"></A>still weather? Absence of motion in a large expanse of air; air is the 
<A NAME="116"></A>matter, and absence of motion is the actuality and substance. What is a 
<A NAME="117"></A>calm? Smoothness of sea; the material substratum is the sea, and the actuality 
<A NAME="118"></A>or shape is smoothness. It is obvious then, from what has been said, what 
<A NAME="119"></A>sensible substance is and how it exists-one kind of it as matter, another 
<A NAME="120"></A>as form or actuality, while the third kind is that which is composed of 
<A NAME="121"></A>these two.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="122"></A><B>Part 3</B>
<A NAME="123"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="124"></A><BR><BR>"We must not fail to notice that sometimes it is not clear whether 
<A NAME="125"></A>a name means the composite substance, or the actuality or form, e.g. whether 
<A NAME="126"></A>'house' is a sign for the composite thing, 'a covering consisting of bricks 
<A NAME="127"></A>and stones laid thus and thus', or for the actuality or form, 'a covering', 
<A NAME="128"></A>and whether a line is 'twoness in length' or 'twoness', and whether an 
<A NAME="129"></A>animal is soul in a body' or 'a soul'; for soul is the substance or actuality 
<A NAME="130"></A>of some body. 'Animal' might even be applied to both, not as something 
<A NAME="131"></A>definable by one formula, but as related to a single thing. But this question, 
<A NAME="132"></A>while important for another purpose, is of no importance for the inquiry 
<A NAME="133"></A>into sensible substance; for the essence certainly attaches to the form 
<A NAME="134"></A>and the actuality. For 'soul' and 'to be soul' are the same, but 'to be 
<A NAME="135"></A>man' and 'man' are not the same, unless even the bare soul is to be called 
<A NAME="136"></A>man; and thus on one interpretation the thing is the same as its essence, 
<A NAME="137"></A>and on another it is not. <BR><BR>"If we examine we find that the syllable 
<A NAME="138"></A>does not consist of the letters + juxtaposition, nor is the house bricks 
<A NAME="139"></A>+ juxtaposition. And this is right; for the juxtaposition or mixing does 
<A NAME="140"></A>not consist of those things of which it is the juxtaposition or mixing. 
<A NAME="141"></A>And the same is true in all other cases; e.g. if the threshold is characterized 
<A NAME="142"></A>by its position, the position is not constituted by the threshold, but 
<A NAME="143"></A>rather the latter is constituted by the former. Nor is man animal + biped, 
<A NAME="144"></A>but there must be something besides these, if these are matter,-something 
<A NAME="145"></A>which is neither an element in the whole nor a compound, but is the substance; 
<A NAME="146"></A>but this people eliminate, and state only the matter. If, then, this is 
<A NAME="147"></A>the cause of the thing's being, and if the cause of its being is its substance, 
<A NAME="148"></A>they will not be stating the substance itself. <BR><BR>"(This, then, must 
<A NAME="149"></A>either be eternal or it must be destructible without being ever in course 
<A NAME="150"></A>of being destroyed, and must have come to be without ever being in course 
<A NAME="151"></A>of coming to be. But it has been proved and explained elsewhere that no 
<A NAME="152"></A>one makes or begets the form, but it is the individual that is made, i.e. 
<A NAME="153"></A>the complex of form and matter that is generated. Whether the substances 
<A NAME="154"></A>of destructible things can exist apart, is not yet at all clear; except 
<A NAME="155"></A>that obviously this is impossible in some cases-in the case of things which 
<A NAME="156"></A>cannot exist apart from the individual instances, e.g. house or utensil. 
<A NAME="157"></A>Perhaps, indeed, neither these things themselves, nor any of the other 
<A NAME="158"></A>things which are not formed by nature, are substances at all; for one might 
<A NAME="159"></A>say that the nature in natural objects is the only substance to be found 
<A NAME="160"></A>in destructible things.) <BR><BR>"Therefore the difficulty which used to 
<A NAME="161"></A>be raised by the school of Antisthenes and other such uneducated people 
<A NAME="162"></A>has a certain timeliness. They said that the 'what' cannot be defined (for 
<A NAME="163"></A>the definition so called is a 'long rigmarole') but of what sort a thing, 
<A NAME="164"></A>e.g. silver, is, they thought it possible actually to explain, not saying 
<A NAME="165"></A>what it is, but that it is like tin. Therefore one kind of substance can 
<A NAME="166"></A>be defined and formulated, i.e. the composite kind, whether it be perceptible 
<A NAME="167"></A>or intelligible; but the primary parts of which this consists cannot be 
<A NAME="168"></A>defined, since a definitory formula predicates something of something, 
<A NAME="169"></A>and one part of the definition must play the part of matter and the other 
<A NAME="170"></A>that of form. <BR><BR>"It is also obvious that, if substances are in a 
<A NAME="171"></A>sense numbers, they are so in this sense and not, as some say, as numbers 
<A NAME="172"></A>of units. For a definition is a sort of number; for (1) it is divisible, 
<A NAME="173"></A>and into indivisible parts (for definitory formulae are not infinite), 
<A NAME="174"></A>and number also is of this nature. And (2) as, when one of the parts of 
<A NAME="175"></A>which a number consists has been taken from or added to the number, it 
<A NAME="176"></A>is no longer the same number, but a different one, even if it is the very 
<A NAME="177"></A>smallest part that has been taken away or added, so the definition and 
<A NAME="178"></A>the essence will no longer remain when anything has been taken away or 
<A NAME="179"></A>added. And (3) the number must be something in virtue of which it is one, 
<A NAME="180"></A>and this these thinkers cannot state, what makes it one, if it is one (for 
<A NAME="181"></A>either it is not one but a sort of heap, or if it is, we ought to say what 
<A NAME="182"></A>it is that makes one out of many); and the definition is one, but similarly 
<A NAME="183"></A>they cannot say what makes it one. And this is a natural result; for the 
<A NAME="184"></A>same reason is applicable, and substance is one in the sense which we have 
<A NAME="185"></A>explained, and not, as some say, by being a sort of unit or point; each 
<A NAME="186"></A>is a complete reality and a definite nature. And (4) as number does not 
<A NAME="187"></A>admit of the more and the less, neither does substance, in the sense of 
<A NAME="188"></A>form, but if any substance does, it is only the substance which involves 
<A NAME="189"></A>matter. Let this, then, suffice for an account of the generation and destruction 
<A NAME="190"></A>of so-called substances in what sense it is possible and in what sense 
<A NAME="191"></A>impossible--and of the reduction of things to number.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="192"></A><B>Part 4</B>
<A NAME="193"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>"Regarding material substance we must not forget that even if all 
<A NAME="195"></A>things come from the same first cause or have the same things for their 
<A NAME="196"></A>first causes, and if the same matter serves as starting-point for their 
<A NAME="197"></A>generation, yet there is a matter proper to each, e.g. for phlegm the sweet 
<A NAME="198"></A>or the fat, and for bile the bitter, or something else; though perhaps 
<A NAME="199"></A>these come from the same original matter. And there come to be several 
<A NAME="200"></A>matters for the same thing, when the one matter is matter for the other; 
<A NAME="201"></A>e.g. phlegm comes from the fat and from the sweet, if the fat comes from 
<A NAME="202"></A>the sweet; and it comes from bile by analysis of the bile into its ultimate 
<A NAME="203"></A>matter. For one thing comes from another in two senses, either because 
<A NAME="204"></A>it will be found at a later stage, or because it is produced if the other 
<A NAME="205"></A>is analysed into its original constituents. When the matter is one, different 
<A NAME="206"></A>things may be produced owing to difference in the moving cause; e.g. from 
<A NAME="207"></A>wood may be made both a chest and a bed. But some different things must 
<A NAME="208"></A>have their matter different; e.g. a saw could not be made of wood, nor 
<A NAME="209"></A>is this in the power of the moving cause; for it could not make a saw of 
<A NAME="210"></A>wool or of wood. But if, as a matter of fact, the same thing can be made 
<A NAME="211"></A>of different material, clearly the art, i.e. the moving principle, is the 
<A NAME="212"></A>same; for if both the matter and the moving cause were different, the product 
<A NAME="213"></A>would be so too. <BR><BR>"When one inquires into the cause of something, 
<A NAME="214"></A>one should, since 'causes' are spoken of in several senses, state all the 
<A NAME="215"></A>possible causes. what is the material cause of man? Shall we say 'the menstrual 
<A NAME="216"></A>fluid'? What is moving cause? Shall we say 'the seed'? The formal cause? 
<A NAME="217"></A>His essence. The final cause? His end. But perhaps the latter two are the 
<A NAME="218"></A>same.-It is the proximate causes we must state. What is the material cause? 
<A NAME="219"></A>We must name not fire or earth, but the matter peculiar to the thing. <BR><BR>"Regarding 
<A NAME="220"></A>the substances that are natural and generable, if the causes are really 
<A NAME="221"></A>these and of this number and we have to learn the causes, we must inquire 
<A NAME="222"></A>thus, if we are to inquire rightly. But in the case of natural but eternal 
<A NAME="223"></A>substances another account must be given. For perhaps some have no matter, 
<A NAME="224"></A>or not matter of this sort but only such as can be moved in respect of 
<A NAME="225"></A>place. Nor does matter belong to those things which exist by nature but 
<A NAME="226"></A>are not substances; their substratum is the substance. E.g what is the 
<A NAME="227"></A>cause of eclipse? What is its matter? There is none; the moon is that which 
<A NAME="228"></A>suffers eclipse. What is the moving cause which extinguished the light? 
<A NAME="229"></A>The earth. The final cause perhaps does not exist. The formal principle 
<A NAME="230"></A>is the definitory formula, but this is obscure if it does not include the 
<A NAME="231"></A>cause. E.g. what is eclipse? Deprivation of light. But if we add 'by the 
<A NAME="232"></A>earth's coming in between', this is the formula which includes the cause. 
<A NAME="233"></A>In the case of sleep it is not clear what it is that proximately has this 
<A NAME="234"></A>affection. Shall we say that it is the animal? Yes, but the animal in virtue 
<A NAME="235"></A>of what, i.e. what is the proximate subject? The heart or some other part. 
<A NAME="236"></A>Next, by what is it produced? Next, what is the affection-that of the proximate 
<A NAME="237"></A>subject, not of the whole animal? Shall we say that it is immobility of 
<A NAME="238"></A>such and such a kind? Yes, but to what process in the proximate subject 
<A NAME="239"></A>is this due?

<A NAME="241"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>"Since some things are and are not, without coming to be and ceasing 
<A NAME="243"></A>to be, e.g. points, if they can be said to be, and in general forms (for 
<A NAME="244"></A>it is not 'white' comes to be, but the wood comes to be white, if everything 
<A NAME="245"></A>that comes to be comes from something and comes to be something), not all 
<A NAME="246"></A>contraries can come from one another, but it is in different senses that 
<A NAME="247"></A>a pale man comes from a dark man, and pale comes from dark. Nor has everything 
<A NAME="248"></A>matter, but only those things which come to be and change into one another. 
<A NAME="249"></A>Those things which, without ever being in course of changing, are or are 
<A NAME="250"></A>not, have no matter. <BR><BR>"There is difficulty in the question how the 
<A NAME="251"></A>matter of each thing is related to its contrary states. E.g. if the body 
<A NAME="252"></A>is potentially healthy, and disease is contrary to health, is it potentially 
<A NAME="253"></A>both healthy and diseased? And is water potentially wine and vinegar? We 
<A NAME="254"></A>answer that it is the matter of one in virtue of its positive state and 
<A NAME="255"></A>its form, and of the other in virtue of the privation of its positive state 
<A NAME="256"></A>and the corruption of it contrary to its nature. It is also hard to say 
<A NAME="257"></A>why wine is not said to be the matter of vinegar nor potentially vinegar 
<A NAME="258"></A>(though vinegar is produced from it), and why a living man is not said 
<A NAME="259"></A>to be potentially dead. In fact they are not, but the corruptions in question 
<A NAME="260"></A>are accidental, and it is the matter of the animal that is itself in virtue 
<A NAME="261"></A>of its corruption the potency and matter of a corpse, and it is water that 
<A NAME="262"></A>is the matter of vinegar. For the corpse comes from the animal, and vinegar 
<A NAME="263"></A>from wine, as night from day. And all the things which change thus into 
<A NAME="264"></A>one another must go back to their matter; e.g. if from a corpse is produced 
<A NAME="265"></A>an animal, the corpse first goes back to its matter, and only then becomes 
<A NAME="266"></A>an animal; and vinegar first goes back to water, and only then becomes 
<A NAME="267"></A>wine.

<A NAME="269"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>"To return to the difficulty which has been stated with respect 
<A NAME="271"></A>both to definitions and to numbers, what is the cause of their unity? In 
<A NAME="272"></A>the case of all things which have several parts and in which the totality 
<A NAME="273"></A>is not, as it were, a mere heap, but the whole is something beside the 
<A NAME="274"></A>parts, there is a cause; for even in bodies contact is the cause of unity 
<A NAME="275"></A>in some cases, and in others viscosity or some other such quality. And 
<A NAME="276"></A>a definition is a set of words which is one not by being connected together, 
<A NAME="277"></A>like the Iliad, but by dealing with one object.-What then, is it that makes 
<A NAME="278"></A>man one; why is he one and not many, e.g. animal + biped, especially if 
<A NAME="279"></A>there are, as some say, an animal-itself and a biped-itself? Why are not 
<A NAME="280"></A>those Forms themselves the man, so that men would exist by participation 
<A NAME="281"></A>not in man, nor in-one Form, but in two, animal and biped, and in general 
<A NAME="282"></A>man would be not one but more than one thing, animal and biped? <BR><BR>"Clearly, 
<A NAME="283"></A>then, if people proceed thus in their usual manner of definition and speech, 
<A NAME="284"></A>they cannot explain and solve the difficulty. But if, as we say, one element 
<A NAME="285"></A>is matter and another is form, and one is potentially and the other actually, 
<A NAME="286"></A>the question will no longer be thought a difficulty. For this difficulty 
<A NAME="287"></A>is the same as would arise if 'round bronze' were the definition of 'cloak'; 
<A NAME="288"></A>for this word would be a sign of the definitory formula, so that the question 
<A NAME="289"></A>is, what is the cause of the unity of 'round' and 'bronze'? The difficulty 
<A NAME="290"></A>disappears, because the one is matter, the other form. What, then, causes 
<A NAME="291"></A>this-that which was potentially to be actually-except, in the case of things 
<A NAME="292"></A>which are generated, the agent? For there is no other cause of the potential 
<A NAME="293"></A>sphere's becoming actually a sphere, but this was the essence of either. 
<A NAME="294"></A>Of matter some is intelligible, some perceptible, and in a formula there 
<A NAME="295"></A>is always an element of matter as well as one of actuality; e.g. the circle 
<A NAME="296"></A>is 'a plane figure'. But of the things which have no matter, either intelligible 
<A NAME="297"></A>or perceptible, each is by its nature essentially a kind of unity, as it 
<A NAME="298"></A>is essentially a kind of being-individual substance, quality, or quantity 
<A NAME="299"></A>(and so neither 'existent' nor 'one' is present in their definitions), 
<A NAME="300"></A>and the essence of each of them is by its very nature a kind of unity as 
<A NAME="301"></A>it is a kind of being-and so none of these has any reason outside itself, 
<A NAME="302"></A>for being one, nor for being a kind of being; for each is by its nature 
<A NAME="303"></A>a kind of being and a kind of unity, not as being in the genus 'being' 
<A NAME="304"></A>or 'one' nor in the sense that being and unity can exist apart from particulars. 
<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>"Owing to the difficulty about unity some speak of 'participation', 
<A NAME="306"></A>and raise the question, what is the cause of participation and what is 
<A NAME="307"></A>it to participate; and others speak of 'communion', as Lycophron says knowledge 
<A NAME="308"></A>is a communion of knowing with the soul; and others say life is a 'composition' 
<A NAME="309"></A>or 'connexion' of soul with body. Yet the same account applies to all cases; 
<A NAME="310"></A>for being healthy, too, will on this showing be either a 'communion' or 
<A NAME="311"></A>a 'connexion' or a 'composition' of soul and health, and the fact that 
<A NAME="312"></A>the bronze is a triangle will be a 'composition' of bronze and triangle, 
<A NAME="313"></A>and the fact that a thing is white will be a 'composition' of surface and 
<A NAME="314"></A>whiteness. The reason is that people look for a unifying formula, and a 
<A NAME="315"></A>difference, between potency and complete reality. But, as has been said, 
<A NAME="316"></A>the proximate matter and the form are one and the same thing, the one potentially, 
<A NAME="317"></A>and the other actually. Therefore it is like asking what in general is 
<A NAME="318"></A>the cause of unity and of a thing's being one; for each thing is a unity, 
<A NAME="319"></A>and the potential and the actual are somehow one. Therefore there is no 
<A NAME="320"></A>other cause here unless there is something which caused the movement from 
<A NAME="321"></A>potency into actuality. And all things which have no matter are without 
<A NAME="322"></A>qualification essentially unities.
