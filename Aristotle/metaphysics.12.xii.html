<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>"The subject of our inquiry is substance; for the principles and 
<A NAME="13"></A>the causes we are seeking are those of substances. For if the universe 
<A NAME="14"></A>is of the nature of a whole, substance is its first part; and if it coheres 
<A NAME="15"></A>merely by virtue of serial succession, on this view also substance is first, 
<A NAME="16"></A>and is succeeded by quality, and then by quantity. At the same time these 
<A NAME="17"></A>latter are not even being in the full sense, but are qualities and movements 
<A NAME="18"></A>of it,-or else even the not-white and the not-straight would be being; 
<A NAME="19"></A>at least we say even these are, e.g. 'there is a not-white'. Further, none 
<A NAME="20"></A>of the categories other than substance can exist apart. And the early philosophers 
<A NAME="21"></A>also in practice testify to the primacy of substance; for it was of substance 
<A NAME="22"></A>that they sought the principles and elements and causes. The thinkers of 
<A NAME="23"></A>the present day tend to rank universals as substances (for genera are universals, 
<A NAME="24"></A>and these they tend to describe as principles and substances, owing to 
<A NAME="25"></A>the abstract nature of their inquiry); but the thinkers of old ranked particular 
<A NAME="26"></A>things as substances, e.g. fire and earth, not what is common to both, 
<A NAME="27"></A>body. <BR><BR>"There are three kinds of substance-one that is sensible 
<A NAME="28"></A>(of which one subdivision is eternal and another is perishable; the latter 
<A NAME="29"></A>is recognized by all men, and includes e.g. plants and animals), of which 
<A NAME="30"></A>we must grasp the elements, whether one or many; and another that is immovable, 
<A NAME="31"></A>and this certain thinkers assert to be capable of existing apart, some 
<A NAME="32"></A>dividing it into two, others identifying the Forms and the objects of mathematics, 
<A NAME="33"></A>and others positing, of these two, only the objects of mathematics. The 
<A NAME="34"></A>former two kinds of substance are the subject of physics (for they imply 
<A NAME="35"></A>movement); but the third kind belongs to another science, if there is no 
<A NAME="36"></A>principle common to it and to the other kinds.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="37"></A><B>Part 2</B>
<A NAME="38"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="39"></A><BR><BR>"Sensible substance is changeable. Now if change proceeds from 
<A NAME="40"></A>opposites or from intermediates, and not from all opposites (for the voice 
<A NAME="41"></A>is not-white, (but it does not therefore change to white)), but from the 
<A NAME="42"></A>contrary, there must be something underlying which changes into the contrary 
<A NAME="43"></A>state; for the contraries do not change. Further, something persists, but 
<A NAME="44"></A>the contrary does not persist; there is, then, some third thing besides 
<A NAME="45"></A>the contraries, viz. the matter. Now since changes are of four kinds-either 
<A NAME="46"></A>in respect of the 'what' or of the quality or of the quantity or of the 
<A NAME="47"></A>place, and change in respect of 'thisness' is simple generation and destruction, 
<A NAME="48"></A>and change in quantity is increase and diminution, and change in respect 
<A NAME="49"></A>of an affection is alteration, and change of place is motion, changes will 
<A NAME="50"></A>be from given states into those contrary to them in these several respects. 
<A NAME="51"></A>The matter, then, which changes must be capable of both states. And since 
<A NAME="52"></A>that which 'is' has two senses, we must say that everything changes from 
<A NAME="53"></A>that which is potentially to that which is actually, e.g. from potentially 
<A NAME="54"></A>white to actually white, and similarly in the case of increase and diminution. 
<A NAME="55"></A>Therefore not only can a thing come to be, incidentally, out of that which 
<A NAME="56"></A>is not, but also all things come to be out of that which is, but is potentially, 
<A NAME="57"></A>and is not actually. And this is the 'One' of Anaxagoras; for instead of 
<A NAME="58"></A>'all things were together'-and the 'Mixture' of Empedocles and Anaximander 
<A NAME="59"></A>and the account given by Democritus-it is better to say 'all things were 
<A NAME="60"></A>together potentially but not actually'. Therefore these thinkers seem to 
<A NAME="61"></A>have had some notion of matter. Now all things that change have matter, 
<A NAME="62"></A>but different matter; and of eternal things those which are not generable 
<A NAME="63"></A>but are movable in space have matter-not matter for generation, however, 
<A NAME="64"></A>but for motion from one place to another. <BR><BR>"One might raise the 
<A NAME="65"></A>question from what sort of non-being generation proceeds; for 'non-being' 
<A NAME="66"></A>has three senses. If, then, one form of non-being exists potentially, still 
<A NAME="67"></A>it is not by virtue of a potentiality for any and every thing, but different 
<A NAME="68"></A>things come from different things; nor is it satisfactory to say that 'all 
<A NAME="69"></A>things were together'; for they differ in their matter, since otherwise 
<A NAME="70"></A>why did an infinity of things come to be, and not one thing? For 'reason' 
<A NAME="71"></A>is one, so that if matter also were one, that must have come to be in actuality 
<A NAME="72"></A>which the matter was in potency. The causes and the principles, then, are 
<A NAME="73"></A>three, two being the pair of contraries of which one is definition and 
<A NAME="74"></A>form and the other is privation, and the third being the 
<A NAME="75"></A>matter.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="76"></A><B>Part 3</B>
<A NAME="77"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="78"></A><BR><BR>"Note, next, that neither the matter nor the form comes to be-and 
<A NAME="79"></A>I mean the last matter and form. For everything that changes is something 
<A NAME="80"></A>and is changed by something and into something. That by which it is changed 
<A NAME="81"></A>is the immediate mover; that which is changed, the matter; that into which 
<A NAME="82"></A>it is changed, the form. The process, then, will go on to infinity, if 
<A NAME="83"></A>not only the bronze comes to be round but also the round or the bronze 
<A NAME="84"></A>comes to be; therefore there must be a stop. <BR><BR>"Note, next, that 
<A NAME="85"></A>each substance comes into being out of something that shares its name. 
<A NAME="86"></A>(Natural objects and other things both rank as substances.) For things 
<A NAME="87"></A>come into being either by art or by nature or by luck or by spontaneity. 
<A NAME="88"></A>Now art is a principle of movement in something other than the thing moved, 
<A NAME="89"></A>nature is a principle in the thing itself (for man begets man), and the 
<A NAME="90"></A>other causes are privations of these two. <BR><BR>"There are three kinds 
<A NAME="91"></A>of substance-the matter, which is a 'this' in appearance (for all things 
<A NAME="92"></A>that are characterized by contact and not, by organic unity are matter 
<A NAME="93"></A>and substratum, e.g. fire, flesh, head; for these are all matter, and the 
<A NAME="94"></A>last matter is the matter of that which is in the full sense substance); 
<A NAME="95"></A>the nature, which is a 'this' or positive state towards which movement 
<A NAME="96"></A>takes place; and again, thirdly, the particular substance which is composed 
<A NAME="97"></A>of these two, e.g. Socrates or Callias. Now in some cases the 'this' does 
<A NAME="98"></A>not exist apart from the composite substance, e.g. the form of house does 
<A NAME="99"></A>not so exist, unless the art of building exists apart (nor is there generation 
<A NAME="100"></A>and destruction of these forms, but it is in another way that the house 
<A NAME="101"></A>apart from its matter, and health, and all ideals of art, exist and do 
<A NAME="102"></A>not exist); but if the 'this' exists apart from the concrete thing, it 
<A NAME="103"></A>is only in the case of natural objects. And so Plato was not far wrong 
<A NAME="104"></A>when he said that there are as many Forms as there are kinds of natural 
<A NAME="105"></A>object (if there are Forms distinct from the things of this earth). The 
<A NAME="106"></A>moving causes exist as things preceding the effects, but causes in the 
<A NAME="107"></A>sense of definitions are simultaneous with their effects. For when a man 
<A NAME="108"></A>is healthy, then health also exists; and the shape of a bronze sphere exists 
<A NAME="109"></A>at the same time as the bronze sphere. (But we must examine whether any 
<A NAME="110"></A>form also survives afterwards. For in some cases there is nothing to prevent 
<A NAME="111"></A>this; e.g. the soul may be of this sort-not all soul but the reason; for 
<A NAME="112"></A>presumably it is impossible that all soul should survive.) Evidently then 
<A NAME="113"></A>there is no necessity, on this ground at least, for the existence of the 
<A NAME="114"></A>Ideas. For man is begotten by man, a given man by an individual father; 
<A NAME="115"></A>and similarly in the arts; for the medical art is the formal cause of 
<A NAME="116"></A>health.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="117"></A><B>Part 4</B>
<A NAME="118"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="119"></A><BR><BR>"The causes and the principles of different things are in a sense 
<A NAME="120"></A>different, but in a sense, if one speaks universally and analogically, 
<A NAME="121"></A>they are the same for all. For one might raise the question whether the 
<A NAME="122"></A>principles and elements are different or the same for substances and for 
<A NAME="123"></A>relative terms, and similarly in the case of each of the categories. But 
<A NAME="124"></A>it would be paradoxical if they were the same for all. For then from the 
<A NAME="125"></A>same elements will proceed relative terms and substances. What then will 
<A NAME="126"></A>this common element be? For (1) (a) there is nothing common to and distinct 
<A NAME="127"></A>from substance and the other categories, viz. those which are predicated; 
<A NAME="128"></A>but an element is prior to the things of which it is an element. But again 
<A NAME="129"></A>(b) substance is not an element in relative terms, nor is any of these 
<A NAME="130"></A>an element in substance. Further, (2) how can all things have the same 
<A NAME="131"></A>elements? For none of the elements can be the same as that which is composed 
<A NAME="132"></A>of elements, e.g. b or a cannot be the same as ba. (None, therefore, of 
<A NAME="133"></A>the intelligibles, e.g. being or unity, is an element; for these are predicable 
<A NAME="134"></A>of each of the compounds as well.) None of the elements, then, will be 
<A NAME="135"></A>either a substance or a relative term; but it must be one or other. All 
<A NAME="136"></A>things, then, have not the same elements. <BR><BR>"Or, as we are wont to 
<A NAME="137"></A>put it, in a sense they have and in a sense they have not; e.g. perhaps 
<A NAME="138"></A>the elements of perceptible bodies are, as form, the hot, and in another 
<A NAME="139"></A>sense the cold, which is the privation; and, as matter, that which directly 
<A NAME="140"></A>and of itself potentially has these attributes; and substances comprise 
<A NAME="141"></A>both these and the things composed of these, of which these are the principles, 
<A NAME="142"></A>or any unity which is produced out of the hot and the cold, e.g. flesh 
<A NAME="143"></A>or bone; for the product must be different from the elements. These things 
<A NAME="144"></A>then have the same elements and principles (though specifically different 
<A NAME="145"></A>things have specifically different elements); but all things have not the 
<A NAME="146"></A>same elements in this sense, but only analogically; i.e. one might say 
<A NAME="147"></A>that there are three principles-the form, the privation, and the matter. 
<A NAME="148"></A>But each of these is different for each class; e.g. in colour they are 
<A NAME="149"></A>white, black, and surface, and in day and night they are light, darkness, 
<A NAME="150"></A>and air. <BR><BR>"Since not only the elements present in a thing are causes, 
<A NAME="151"></A>but also something external, i.e. the moving cause, clearly while 'principle' 
<A NAME="152"></A>and 'element' are different both are causes, and 'principle' is divided 
<A NAME="153"></A>into these two kinds; and that which acts as producing movement or rest 
<A NAME="154"></A>is a principle and a substance. Therefore analogically there are three 
<A NAME="155"></A>elements, and four causes and principles; but the elements are different 
<A NAME="156"></A>in different things, and the proximate moving cause is different for different 
<A NAME="157"></A>things. Health, disease, body; the moving cause is the medical art. Form, 
<A NAME="158"></A>disorder of a particular kind, bricks; the moving cause is the building 
<A NAME="159"></A>art. And since the moving cause in the case of natural things is-for man, 
<A NAME="160"></A>for instance, man, and in the products of thought the form or its contrary, 
<A NAME="161"></A>there will be in a sense three causes, while in a sense there are four. 
<A NAME="162"></A>For the medical art is in some sense health, and the building art is the 
<A NAME="163"></A>form of the house, and man begets man; further, besides these there is 
<A NAME="164"></A>that which as first of all things moves all things.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="165"></A><B>Part 5</B>
<A NAME="166"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="167"></A><BR><BR>"Some things can exist apart and some cannot, and it is the former 
<A NAME="168"></A>that are substances. And therefore all things have the same causes, because, 
<A NAME="169"></A>without substances, modifications and movements do not exist. Further, 
<A NAME="170"></A>these causes will probably be soul and body, or reason and desire and body. 
<A NAME="171"></A><BR><BR>"And in yet another way, analogically identical things are principles, 
<A NAME="172"></A>i.e. actuality and potency; but these also are not only different for different 
<A NAME="173"></A>things but also apply in different ways to them. For in some cases the 
<A NAME="174"></A>same thing exists at one time actually and at another potentially, e.g. 
<A NAME="175"></A>wine or flesh or man does so. (And these too fall under the above-named 
<A NAME="176"></A>causes. For the form exists actually, if it can exist apart, and so does 
<A NAME="177"></A>the complex of form and matter, and the privation, e.g. darkness or disease; 
<A NAME="178"></A>but the matter exists potentially; for this is that which can become qualified 
<A NAME="179"></A>either by the form or by the privation.) But the distinction of actuality 
<A NAME="180"></A>and potentiality applies in another way to cases where the matter of cause 
<A NAME="181"></A>and of effect is not the same, in some of which cases the form is not the 
<A NAME="182"></A>same but different; e.g. the cause of man is (1) the elements in man (viz. 
<A NAME="183"></A>fire and earth as matter, and the peculiar form), and further (2) something 
<A NAME="184"></A>else outside, i.e. the father, and (3) besides these the sun and its oblique 
<A NAME="185"></A>course, which are neither matter nor form nor privation of man nor of the 
<A NAME="186"></A>same species with him, but moving causes. <BR><BR>"Further, one must observe 
<A NAME="187"></A>that some causes can be expressed in universal terms, and some cannot. 
<A NAME="188"></A>The proximate principles of all things are the 'this' which is proximate 
<A NAME="189"></A>in actuality, and another which is proximate in potentiality. The universal 
<A NAME="190"></A>causes, then, of which we spoke do not exist. For it is the individual 
<A NAME="191"></A>that is the originative principle of the individuals. For while man is 
<A NAME="192"></A>the originative principle of man universally, there is no universal man, 
<A NAME="193"></A>but Peleus is the originative principle of Achilles, and your father of 
<A NAME="194"></A>you, and this particular b of this particular ba, though b in general is 
<A NAME="195"></A>the originative principle of ba taken without qualification. <BR><BR>"Further, 
<A NAME="196"></A>if the causes of substances are the causes of all things, yet different 
<A NAME="197"></A>things have different causes and elements, as was said; the causes of things 
<A NAME="198"></A>that are not in the same class, e.g. of colours and sounds, of substances 
<A NAME="199"></A>and quantities, are different except in an analogical sense; and those 
<A NAME="200"></A>of things in the same species are different, not in species, but in the 
<A NAME="201"></A>sense that the causes of different individuals are different, your matter 
<A NAME="202"></A>and form and moving cause being different from mine, while in their universal 
<A NAME="203"></A>definition they are the same. And if we inquire what are the principles 
<A NAME="204"></A>or elements of substances and relations and qualities-whether they are 
<A NAME="205"></A>the same or different-clearly when the names of the causes are used in 
<A NAME="206"></A>several senses the causes of each are the same, but when the senses are 
<A NAME="207"></A>distinguished the causes are not the same but different, except that in 
<A NAME="208"></A>the following senses the causes of all are the same. They are (1) the same 
<A NAME="209"></A>or analogous in this sense, that matter, form, privation, and the moving 
<A NAME="210"></A>cause are common to all things; and (2) the causes of substances may be 
<A NAME="211"></A>treated as causes of all things in this sense, that when substances are 
<A NAME="212"></A>removed all things are removed; further, (3) that which is first in respect 
<A NAME="213"></A>of complete reality is the cause of all things. But in another sense there 
<A NAME="214"></A>are different first causes, viz. all the contraries which are neither generic 
<A NAME="215"></A>nor ambiguous terms; and, further, the matters of different things are 
<A NAME="216"></A>different. We have stated, then, what are the principles of sensible things 
<A NAME="217"></A>and how many they are, and in what sense they are the same and in what 
<A NAME="218"></A>sense different.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="219"></A><B>Part 6</B>
<A NAME="220"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>"Since there were three kinds of substance, two of them physical 
<A NAME="222"></A>and one unmovable, regarding the latter we must assert that it is necessary 
<A NAME="223"></A>that there should be an eternal unmovable substance. For substances are 
<A NAME="224"></A>the first of existing things, and if they are all destructible, all things 
<A NAME="225"></A>are destructible. But it is impossible that movement should either have 
<A NAME="226"></A>come into being or cease to be (for it must always have existed), or that 
<A NAME="227"></A>time should. For there could not be a before and an after if time did not 
<A NAME="228"></A>exist. Movement also is continuous, then, in the sense in which time is; 
<A NAME="229"></A>for time is either the same thing as movement or an attribute of movement. 
<A NAME="230"></A>And there is no continuous movement except movement in place, and of this 
<A NAME="231"></A>only that which is circular is continuous. <BR><BR>"But if there is something 
<A NAME="232"></A>which is capable of moving things or acting on them, but is not actually 
<A NAME="233"></A>doing so, there will not necessarily be movement; for that which has a 
<A NAME="234"></A>potency need not exercise it. Nothing, then, is gained even if we suppose 
<A NAME="235"></A>eternal substances, as the believers in the Forms do, unless there is to 
<A NAME="236"></A>be in them some principle which can cause change; nay, even this is not 
<A NAME="237"></A>enough, nor is another substance besides the Forms enough; for if it is 
<A NAME="238"></A>not to act, there will be no movement. Further even if it acts, this will 
<A NAME="239"></A>not be enough, if its essence is potency; for there will not be eternal 
<A NAME="240"></A>movement, since that which is potentially may possibly not be. There must, 
<A NAME="241"></A>then, be such a principle, whose very essence is actuality. Further, then, 
<A NAME="242"></A>these substances must be without matter; for they must be eternal, if anything 
<A NAME="243"></A>is eternal. Therefore they must be actuality. <BR><BR>"Yet there is a difficulty; 
<A NAME="244"></A>for it is thought that everything that acts is able to act, but that not 
<A NAME="245"></A>everything that is able to act acts, so that the potency is prior. But 
<A NAME="246"></A>if this is so, nothing that is need be; for it is possible for all things 
<A NAME="247"></A>to be capable of existing but not yet to exist. <BR><BR>"Yet if we follow 
<A NAME="248"></A>the theologians who generate the world from night, or the natural philosophers 
<A NAME="249"></A>who say that 'all things were together', the same impossible result ensues. 
<A NAME="250"></A>For how will there be movement, if there is no actually existing cause? 
<A NAME="251"></A>Wood will surely not move itself-the carpenter's art must act on it; nor 
<A NAME="252"></A>will the menstrual blood nor the earth set themselves in motion, but the 
<A NAME="253"></A>seeds must act on the earth and the semen on the menstrual blood. <BR><BR>"This 
<A NAME="254"></A>is why some suppose eternal actuality-e.g. Leucippus and Plato; for they 
<A NAME="255"></A>say there is always movement. But why and what this movement is they do 
<A NAME="256"></A>say, nor, if the world moves in this way or that, do they tell us the cause 
<A NAME="257"></A>of its doing so. Now nothing is moved at random, but there must always 
<A NAME="258"></A>be something present to move it; e.g. as a matter of fact a thing moves 
<A NAME="259"></A>in one way by nature, and in another by force or through the influence 
<A NAME="260"></A>of reason or something else. (Further, what sort of movement is primary? 
<A NAME="261"></A>This makes a vast difference.) But again for Plato, at least, it is not 
<A NAME="262"></A>permissible to name here that which he sometimes supposes to be the source 
<A NAME="263"></A>of movement-that which moves itself; for the soul is later, and coeval 
<A NAME="264"></A>with the heavens, according to his account. To suppose potency prior to 
<A NAME="265"></A>actuality, then, is in a sense right, and in a sense not; and we have specified 
<A NAME="266"></A>these senses. That actuality is prior is testified by Anaxagoras (for his 
<A NAME="267"></A>'reason' is actuality) and by Empedocles in his doctrine of love and strife, 
<A NAME="268"></A>and by those who say that there is always movement, e.g. Leucippus. Therefore 
<A NAME="269"></A>chaos or night did not exist for an infinite time, but the same things 
<A NAME="270"></A>have always existed (either passing through a cycle of changes or obeying 
<A NAME="271"></A>some other law), since actuality is prior to potency. If, then, there is 
<A NAME="272"></A>a constant cycle, something must always remain, acting in the same way. 
<A NAME="273"></A>And if there is to be generation and destruction, there must be something 
<A NAME="274"></A>else which is always acting in different ways. This must, then, act in 
<A NAME="275"></A>one way in virtue of itself, and in another in virtue of something else-either 
<A NAME="276"></A>of a third agent, therefore, or of the first. Now it must be in virtue 
<A NAME="277"></A>of the first. For otherwise this again causes the motion both of the second 
<A NAME="278"></A>agent and of the third. Therefore it is better to say 'the first'. For 
<A NAME="279"></A>it was the cause of eternal uniformity; and something else is the cause 
<A NAME="280"></A>of variety, and evidently both together are the cause of eternal variety. 
<A NAME="281"></A>This, accordingly, is the character which the motions actually exhibit. 
<A NAME="282"></A>What need then is there to seek for other principles?
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="283"></A><B>Part 7</B>
<A NAME="284"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="285"></A><BR><BR>"Since (1) this is a possible account of the matter, and (2) if 
<A NAME="286"></A>it were not true, the world would have proceeded out of night and 'all 
<A NAME="287"></A>things together' and out of non-being, these difficulties may be taken 
<A NAME="288"></A>as solved. There is, then, something which is always moved with an unceasing 
<A NAME="289"></A>motion, which is motion in a circle; and this is plain not in theory only 
<A NAME="290"></A>but in fact. Therefore the first heaven must be eternal. There is therefore 
<A NAME="291"></A>also something which moves it. And since that which moves and is moved 
<A NAME="292"></A>is intermediate, there is something which moves without being moved, being 
<A NAME="293"></A>eternal, substance, and actuality. And the object of desire and the object 
<A NAME="294"></A>of thought move in this way; they move without being moved. The primary 
<A NAME="295"></A>objects of desire and of thought are the same. For the apparent good is 
<A NAME="296"></A>the object of appetite, and the real good is the primary object of rational 
<A NAME="297"></A>wish. But desire is consequent on opinion rather than opinion on desire; 
<A NAME="298"></A>for the thinking is the starting-point. And thought is moved by the object 
<A NAME="299"></A>of thought, and one of the two columns of opposites is in itself the object 
<A NAME="300"></A>of thought; and in this, substance is first, and in substance, that which 
<A NAME="301"></A>is simple and exists actually. (The one and the simple are not the same; 
<A NAME="302"></A>for 'one' means a measure, but 'simple' means that the thing itself has 
<A NAME="303"></A>a certain nature.) But the beautiful, also, and that which is in itself 
<A NAME="304"></A>desirable are in the same column; and the first in any class is always 
<A NAME="305"></A>best, or analogous to the best. <BR><BR>"That a final cause may exist among 
<A NAME="306"></A>unchangeable entities is shown by the distinction of its meanings. For 
<A NAME="307"></A>the final cause is (a) some being for whose good an action is done, and 
<A NAME="308"></A>(b) something at which the action aims; and of these the latter exists 
<A NAME="309"></A>among unchangeable entities though the former does not. The final cause, 
<A NAME="310"></A>then, produces motion as being loved, but all other things move by being 
<A NAME="311"></A>moved. Now if something is moved it is capable of being otherwise than 
<A NAME="312"></A>as it is. Therefore if its actuality is the primary form of spatial motion, 
<A NAME="313"></A>then in so far as it is subject to change, in this respect it is capable 
<A NAME="314"></A>of being otherwise,-in place, even if not in substance. But since there 
<A NAME="315"></A>is something which moves while itself unmoved, existing actually, this 
<A NAME="316"></A>can in no way be otherwise than as it is. For motion in space is the first 
<A NAME="317"></A>of the kinds of change, and motion in a circle the first kind of spatial 
<A NAME="318"></A>motion; and this the first mover produces. The first mover, then, exists 
<A NAME="319"></A>of necessity; and in so far as it exists by necessity, its mode of being 
<A NAME="320"></A>is good, and it is in this sense a first principle. For the necessary has 
<A NAME="321"></A>all these senses-that which is necessary perforce because it is contrary 
<A NAME="322"></A>to the natural impulse, that without which the good is impossible, and 
<A NAME="323"></A>that which cannot be otherwise but can exist only in a single way. <BR><BR>"On 
<A NAME="324"></A>such a principle, then, depend the heavens and the world of nature. And 
<A NAME="325"></A>it is a life such as the best which we enjoy, and enjoy for but a short 
<A NAME="326"></A>time (for it is ever in this state, which we cannot be), since its actuality 
<A NAME="327"></A>is also pleasure. (And for this reason are waking, perception, and thinking 
<A NAME="328"></A>most pleasant, and hopes and memories are so on account of these.) And 
<A NAME="329"></A>thinking in itself deals with that which is best in itself, and that which 
<A NAME="330"></A>is thinking in the fullest sense with that which is best in the fullest 
<A NAME="331"></A>sense. And thought thinks on itself because it shares the nature of the 
<A NAME="332"></A>object of thought; for it becomes an object of thought in coming into contact 
<A NAME="333"></A>with and thinking its objects, so that thought and object of thought are 
<A NAME="334"></A>the same. For that which is capable of receiving the object of thought, 
<A NAME="335"></A>i.e. the essence, is thought. But it is active when it possesses this object. 
<A NAME="336"></A>Therefore the possession rather than the receptivity is the divine element 
<A NAME="337"></A>which thought seems to contain, and the act of contemplation is what is 
<A NAME="338"></A>most pleasant and best. If, then, God is always in that good state in which 
<A NAME="339"></A>we sometimes are, this compels our wonder; and if in a better this compels 
<A NAME="340"></A>it yet more. And God is in a better state. And life also belongs to God; 
<A NAME="341"></A>for the actuality of thought is life, and God is that actuality; and God's 
<A NAME="342"></A>self-dependent actuality is life most good and eternal. We say therefore 
<A NAME="343"></A>that God is a living being, eternal, most good, so that life and duration 
<A NAME="344"></A>continuous and eternal belong to God; for this is God. <BR><BR>"Those who 
<A NAME="345"></A>suppose, as the Pythagoreans and Speusippus do, that supreme beauty and 
<A NAME="346"></A>goodness are not present in the beginning, because the beginnings both 
<A NAME="347"></A>of plants and of animals are causes, but beauty and completeness are in 
<A NAME="348"></A>the effects of these, are wrong in their opinion. For the seed comes from 
<A NAME="349"></A>other individuals which are prior and complete, and the first thing is 
<A NAME="350"></A>not seed but the complete being; e.g. we must say that before the seed 
<A NAME="351"></A>there is a man,-not the man produced from the seed, but another from whom 
<A NAME="352"></A>the seed comes. <BR><BR>"It is clear then from what has been said that 
<A NAME="353"></A>there is a substance which is eternal and unmovable and separate from sensible 
<A NAME="354"></A>things. It has been shown also that this substance cannot have any magnitude, 
<A NAME="355"></A>but is without parts and indivisible (for it produces movement through 
<A NAME="356"></A>infinite time, but nothing finite has infinite power; and, while every 
<A NAME="357"></A>magnitude is either infinite or finite, it cannot, for the above reason, 
<A NAME="358"></A>have finite magnitude, and it cannot have infinite magnitude because there 
<A NAME="359"></A>is no infinite magnitude at all). But it has also been shown that it is 
<A NAME="360"></A>impassive and unalterable; for all the other changes are posterior to change 
<A NAME="361"></A>of place.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="362"></A><B>Part 8</B>
<A NAME="363"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>"It is clear, then, why these things are as they are. But we must 
<A NAME="365"></A>not ignore the question whether we have to suppose one such substance or 
<A NAME="366"></A>more than one, and if the latter, how many; we must also mention, regarding 
<A NAME="367"></A>the opinions expressed by others, that they have said nothing about the 
<A NAME="368"></A>number of the substances that can even be clearly stated. For the theory 
<A NAME="369"></A>of Ideas has no special discussion of the subject; for those who speak 
<A NAME="370"></A>of Ideas say the Ideas are numbers, and they speak of numbers now as unlimited, 
<A NAME="371"></A>now as limited by the number 10; but as for the reason why there should 
<A NAME="372"></A>be just so many numbers, nothing is said with any demonstrative exactness. 
<A NAME="373"></A>We however must discuss the subject, starting from the presuppositions 
<A NAME="374"></A>and distinctions we have mentioned. The first principle or primary being 
<A NAME="375"></A>is not movable either in itself or accidentally, but produces the primary 
<A NAME="376"></A>eternal and single movement. But since that which is moved must be moved 
<A NAME="377"></A>by something, and the first mover must be in itself unmovable, and eternal 
<A NAME="378"></A>movement must be produced by something eternal and a single movement by 
<A NAME="379"></A>a single thing, and since we see that besides the simple spatial movement 
<A NAME="380"></A>of the universe, which we say the first and unmovable substance produces, 
<A NAME="381"></A>there are other spatial movements-those of the planets-which are eternal 
<A NAME="382"></A>(for a body which moves in a circle is eternal and unresting; we have proved 
<A NAME="383"></A>these points in the physical treatises), each of these movements also must 
<A NAME="384"></A>be caused by a substance both unmovable in itself and eternal. For the 
<A NAME="385"></A>nature of the stars is eternal just because it is a certain kind of substance, 
<A NAME="386"></A>and the mover is eternal and prior to the moved, and that which is prior 
<A NAME="387"></A>to a substance must be a substance. Evidently, then, there must be substances 
<A NAME="388"></A>which are of the same number as the movements of the stars, and in their 
<A NAME="389"></A>nature eternal, and in themselves unmovable, and without magnitude, for 
<A NAME="390"></A>the reason before mentioned. That the movers are substances, then, and 
<A NAME="391"></A>that one of these is first and another second according to the same order 
<A NAME="392"></A>as the movements of the stars, is evident. But in the number of the movements 
<A NAME="393"></A>we reach a problem which must be treated from the standpoint of that one 
<A NAME="394"></A>of the mathematical sciences which is most akin to philosophy-viz. of astronomy; 
<A NAME="395"></A>for this science speculates about substance which is perceptible but eternal, 
<A NAME="396"></A>but the other mathematical sciences, i.e. arithmetic and geometry, treat 
<A NAME="397"></A>of no substance. That the movements are more numerous than the bodies that 
<A NAME="398"></A>are moved is evident to those who have given even moderate attention to 
<A NAME="399"></A>the matter; for each of the planets has more than one movement. But as 
<A NAME="400"></A>to the actual number of these movements, we now-to give some notion of 
<A NAME="401"></A>the subject-quote what some of the mathematicians say, that our thought 
<A NAME="402"></A>may have some definite number to grasp; but, for the rest, we must partly 
<A NAME="403"></A>investigate for ourselves, Partly learn from other investigators, and if 
<A NAME="404"></A>those who study this subject form an opinion contrary to what we have now 
<A NAME="405"></A>stated, we must esteem both parties indeed, but follow the more accurate. 
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR>"Eudoxus supposed that the motion of the sun or of the moon involves, 
<A NAME="407"></A>in either case, three spheres, of which the first is the sphere of the 
<A NAME="408"></A>fixed stars, and the second moves in the circle which runs along the middle 
<A NAME="409"></A>of the zodiac, and the third in the circle which is inclined across the 
<A NAME="410"></A>breadth of the zodiac; but the circle in which the moon moves is inclined 
<A NAME="411"></A>at a greater angle than that in which the sun moves. And the motion of 
<A NAME="412"></A>the planets involves, in each case, four spheres, and of these also the 
<A NAME="413"></A>first and second are the same as the first two mentioned above (for the 
<A NAME="414"></A>sphere of the fixed stars is that which moves all the other spheres, and 
<A NAME="415"></A>that which is placed beneath this and has its movement in the circle which 
<A NAME="416"></A>bisects the zodiac is common to all), but the poles of the third sphere 
<A NAME="417"></A>of each planet are in the circle which bisects the zodiac, and the motion 
<A NAME="418"></A>of the fourth sphere is in the circle which is inclined at an angle to 
<A NAME="419"></A>the equator of the third sphere; and the poles of the third sphere are 
<A NAME="420"></A>different for each of the other planets, but those of Venus and Mercury 
<A NAME="421"></A>are the same. <BR><BR>"Callippus made the position of the spheres the same 
<A NAME="422"></A>as Eudoxus did, but while he assigned the same number as Eudoxus did to 
<A NAME="423"></A>Jupiter and to Saturn, he thought two more spheres should be added to the 
<A NAME="424"></A>sun and two to the moon, if one is to explain the observed facts; and one 
<A NAME="425"></A>more to each of the other planets. <BR><BR>"But it is necessary, if all 
<A NAME="426"></A>the spheres combined are to explain the observed facts, that for each of 
<A NAME="427"></A>the planets there should be other spheres (one fewer than those hitherto 
<A NAME="428"></A>assigned) which counteract those already mentioned and bring back to the 
<A NAME="429"></A>same position the outermost sphere of the star which in each case is situated 
<A NAME="430"></A>below the star in question; for only thus can all the forces at work produce 
<A NAME="431"></A>the observed motion of the planets. Since, then, the spheres involved in 
<A NAME="432"></A>the movement of the planets themselves are--eight for Saturn and Jupiter 
<A NAME="433"></A>and twenty-five for the others, and of these only those involved in the 
<A NAME="434"></A>movement of the lowest-situated planet need not be counteracted the spheres 
<A NAME="435"></A>which counteract those of the outermost two planets will be six in number, 
<A NAME="436"></A>and the spheres which counteract those of the next four planets will be 
<A NAME="437"></A>sixteen; therefore the number of all the spheres--both those which move 
<A NAME="438"></A>the planets and those which counteract these--will be fifty-five. And if 
<A NAME="439"></A>one were not to add to the moon and to the sun the movements we mentioned, 
<A NAME="440"></A>the whole set of spheres will be forty-seven in number. <BR><BR>"Let this, 
<A NAME="441"></A>then, be taken as the number of the spheres, so that the unmovable substances 
<A NAME="442"></A>and principles also may probably be taken as just so many; the assertion 
<A NAME="443"></A>of necessity must be left to more powerful thinkers. But if there can be 
<A NAME="444"></A>no spatial movement which does not conduce to the moving of a star, and 
<A NAME="445"></A>if further every being and every substance which is immune from change 
<A NAME="446"></A>and in virtue of itself has attained to the best must be considered an 
<A NAME="447"></A>end, there can be no other being apart from these we have named, but this 
<A NAME="448"></A>must be the number of the substances. For if there are others, they will 
<A NAME="449"></A>cause change as being a final cause of movement; but there cannot he other 
<A NAME="450"></A>movements besides those mentioned. And it is reasonable to infer this from 
<A NAME="451"></A>a consideration of the bodies that are moved; for if everything that moves 
<A NAME="452"></A>is for the sake of that which is moved, and every movement belongs to something 
<A NAME="453"></A>that is moved, no movement can be for the sake of itself or of another 
<A NAME="454"></A>movement, but all the movements must be for the sake of the stars. For 
<A NAME="455"></A>if there is to be a movement for the sake of a movement, this latter also 
<A NAME="456"></A>will have to be for the sake of something else; so that since there cannot 
<A NAME="457"></A>be an infinite regress, the end of every movement will be one of the divine 
<A NAME="458"></A>bodies which move through the heaven. <BR><BR>"(Evidently there is but 
<A NAME="459"></A>one heaven. For if there are many heavens as there are many men, the moving 
<A NAME="460"></A>principles, of which each heaven will have one, will be one in form but 
<A NAME="461"></A>in number many. But all things that are many in number have matter; for 
<A NAME="462"></A>one and the same definition, e.g. that of man, applies to many things, 
<A NAME="463"></A>while Socrates is one. But the primary essence has not matter; for it is 
<A NAME="464"></A>complete reality. So the unmovable first mover is one both in definition 
<A NAME="465"></A>and in number; so too, therefore, is that which is moved always and continuously; 
<A NAME="466"></A>therefore there is one heaven alone.) Our forefathers in the most remote 
<A NAME="467"></A>ages have handed down to their posterity a tradition, in the form of a 
<A NAME="468"></A>myth, that these bodies are gods, and that the divine encloses the whole 
<A NAME="469"></A>of nature. The rest of the tradition has been added later in mythical form 
<A NAME="470"></A>with a view to the persuasion of the multitude and to its legal and utilitarian 
<A NAME="471"></A>expediency; they say these gods are in the form of men or like some of 
<A NAME="472"></A>the other animals, and they say other things consequent on and similar 
<A NAME="473"></A>to these which we have mentioned. But if one were to separate the first 
<A NAME="474"></A>point from these additions and take it alone-that they thought the first 
<A NAME="475"></A>substances to be gods, one must regard this as an inspired utterance, and 
<A NAME="476"></A>reflect that, while probably each art and each science has often been developed 
<A NAME="477"></A>as far as possible and has again perished, these opinions, with others, 
<A NAME="478"></A>have been preserved until the present like relics of the ancient treasure. 
<A NAME="479"></A>Only thus far, then, is the opinion of our ancestors and of our earliest 
<A NAME="480"></A>predecessors clear to us.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="481"></A><B>Part 9</B>
<A NAME="482"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>"The nature of the divine thought involves certain problems; for 
<A NAME="484"></A>while thought is held to be the most divine of things observed by us, the 
<A NAME="485"></A>question how it must be situated in order to have that character involves 
<A NAME="486"></A>difficulties. For if it thinks of nothing, what is there here of dignity? 
<A NAME="487"></A>It is just like one who sleeps. And if it thinks, but this depends on something 
<A NAME="488"></A>else, then (since that which is its substance is not the act of thinking, 
<A NAME="489"></A>but a potency) it cannot be the best substance; for it is through thinking 
<A NAME="490"></A>that its value belongs to it. Further, whether its substance is the faculty 
<A NAME="491"></A>of thought or the act of thinking, what does it think of? Either of itself 
<A NAME="492"></A>or of something else; and if of something else, either of the same thing 
<A NAME="493"></A>always or of something different. Does it matter, then, or not, whether 
<A NAME="494"></A>it thinks of the good or of any chance thing? Are there not some things 
<A NAME="495"></A>about which it is incredible that it should think? Evidently, then, it 
<A NAME="496"></A>thinks of that which is most divine and precious, and it does not change; 
<A NAME="497"></A>for change would be change for the worse, and this would be already a movement. 
<A NAME="498"></A>First, then, if 'thought' is not the act of thinking but a potency, it 
<A NAME="499"></A>would be reasonable to suppose that the continuity of its thinking is wearisome 
<A NAME="500"></A>to it. Secondly, there would evidently be something else more precious 
<A NAME="501"></A>than thought, viz. that which is thought of. For both thinking and the 
<A NAME="502"></A>act of thought will belong even to one who thinks of the worst thing in 
<A NAME="503"></A>the world, so that if this ought to be avoided (and it ought, for there 
<A NAME="504"></A>are even some things which it is better not to see than to see), the act 
<A NAME="505"></A>of thinking cannot be the best of things. Therefore it must be of itself 
<A NAME="506"></A>that the divine thought thinks (since it is the most excellent of things), 
<A NAME="507"></A>and its thinking is a thinking on thinking. <BR><BR>"But evidently knowledge 
<A NAME="508"></A>and perception and opinion and understanding have always something else 
<A NAME="509"></A>as their object, and themselves only by the way. Further, if thinking and 
<A NAME="510"></A>being thought of are different, in respect of which does goodness belong 
<A NAME="511"></A>to thought? For to he an act of thinking and to he an object of thought 
<A NAME="512"></A>are not the same thing. We answer that in some cases the knowledge is the 
<A NAME="513"></A>object. In the productive sciences it is the substance or essence of the 
<A NAME="514"></A>object, matter omitted, and in the theoretical sciences the definition 
<A NAME="515"></A>or the act of thinking is the object. Since, then, thought and the object 
<A NAME="516"></A>of thought are not different in the case of things that have not matter, 
<A NAME="517"></A>the divine thought and its object will be the same, i.e. the thinking will 
<A NAME="518"></A>be one with the object of its thought. <BR><BR>"A further question is left-whether 
<A NAME="519"></A>the object of the divine thought is composite; for if it were, thought 
<A NAME="520"></A>would change in passing from part to part of the whole. We answer that 
<A NAME="521"></A>everything which has not matter is indivisible-as human thought, or rather 
<A NAME="522"></A>the thought of composite beings, is in a certain period of time (for it 
<A NAME="523"></A>does not possess the good at this moment or at that, but its best, being 
<A NAME="524"></A>something different from it, is attained only in a whole period of time), 
<A NAME="525"></A>so throughout eternity is the thought which has itself for its 
<A NAME="526"></A>object.

<A NAME="528"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="529"></A><BR><BR>"We must consider also in which of two ways the nature of the universe 
<A NAME="530"></A>contains the good, and the highest good, whether as something separate 
<A NAME="531"></A>and by itself, or as the order of the parts. Probably in both ways, as 
<A NAME="532"></A>an army does; for its good is found both in its order and in its leader, 
<A NAME="533"></A>and more in the latter; for he does not depend on the order but it depends 
<A NAME="534"></A>on him. And all things are ordered together somehow, but not all alike,-both 
<A NAME="535"></A>fishes and fowls and plants; and the world is not such that one thing has 
<A NAME="536"></A>nothing to do with another, but they are connected. For all are ordered 
<A NAME="537"></A>together to one end, but it is as in a house, where the freemen are least 
<A NAME="538"></A>at liberty to act at random, but all things or most things are already 
<A NAME="539"></A>ordained for them, while the slaves and the animals do little for the common 
<A NAME="540"></A>good, and for the most part live at random; for this is the sort of principle 
<A NAME="541"></A>that constitutes the nature of each. I mean, for instance, that all must 
<A NAME="542"></A>at least come to be dissolved into their elements, and there are other 
<A NAME="543"></A>functions similarly in which all share for the good of the whole. <BR><BR>"We 
<A NAME="544"></A>must not fail to observe how many impossible or paradoxical results confront 
<A NAME="545"></A>those who hold different views from our own, and what are the views of 
<A NAME="546"></A>the subtler thinkers, and which views are attended by fewest difficulties. 
<A NAME="547"></A>All make all things out of contraries. But neither 'all things' nor 'out 
<A NAME="548"></A>of contraries' is right; nor do these thinkers tell us how all the things 
<A NAME="549"></A>in which the contraries are present can be made out of the contraries; 
<A NAME="550"></A>for contraries are not affected by one another. Now for us this difficulty 
<A NAME="551"></A>is solved naturally by the fact that there is a third element. These thinkers 
<A NAME="552"></A>however make one of the two contraries matter; this is done for instance 
<A NAME="553"></A>by those who make the unequal matter for the equal, or the many matter 
<A NAME="554"></A>for the one. But this also is refuted in the same way; for the one matter 
<A NAME="555"></A>which underlies any pair of contraries is contrary to nothing. Further, 
<A NAME="556"></A>all things, except the one, will, on the view we are criticizing, partake 
<A NAME="557"></A>of evil; for the bad itself is one of the two elements. But the other school 
<A NAME="558"></A>does not treat the good and the bad even as principles; yet in all things 
<A NAME="559"></A>the good is in the highest degree a principle. The school we first mentioned 
<A NAME="560"></A>is right in saying that it is a principle, but how the good is a principle 
<A NAME="561"></A>they do not say-whether as end or as mover or as form. <BR><BR>"Empedocles 
<A NAME="562"></A>also has a paradoxical view; for he identifies the good with love, but 
<A NAME="563"></A>this is a principle both as mover (for it brings things together) and as 
<A NAME="564"></A>matter (for it is part of the mixture). Now even if it happens that the 
<A NAME="565"></A>same thing is a principle both as matter and as mover, still the being, 
<A NAME="566"></A>at least, of the two is not the same. In which respect then is love a principle? 
<A NAME="567"></A>It is paradoxical also that strife should be imperishable; the nature of 
<A NAME="568"></A>his 'evil' is just strife. <BR><BR>"Anaxagoras makes the good a motive 
<A NAME="569"></A>principle; for his 'reason' moves things. But it moves them for an end, 
<A NAME="570"></A>which must be something other than it, except according to our way of stating 
<A NAME="571"></A>the case; for, on our view, the medical art is in a sense health. It is 
<A NAME="572"></A>paradoxical also not to suppose a contrary to the good, i.e. to reason. 
<A NAME="573"></A>But all who speak of the contraries make no use of the contraries, unless 
<A NAME="574"></A>we bring their views into shape. And why some things are perishable and 
<A NAME="575"></A>others imperishable, no one tells us; for they make all existing things 
<A NAME="576"></A>out of the same principles. Further, some make existing things out of the 
<A NAME="577"></A>nonexistent; and others to avoid the necessity of this make all things 
<A NAME="578"></A>one. <BR><BR>"Further, why should there always be becoming, and what is 
<A NAME="579"></A>the cause of becoming?-this no one tells us. And those who suppose two 
<A NAME="580"></A>principles must suppose another, a superior principle, and so must those 
<A NAME="581"></A>who believe in the Forms; for why did things come to participate, or why 
<A NAME="582"></A>do they participate, in the Forms? And all other thinkers are confronted 
<A NAME="583"></A>by the necessary consequence that there is something contrary to Wisdom, 
<A NAME="584"></A>i.e. to the highest knowledge; but we are not. For there is nothing contrary 
<A NAME="585"></A>to that which is primary; for all contraries have matter, and things that 
<A NAME="586"></A>have matter exist only potentially; and the ignorance which is contrary 
<A NAME="587"></A>to any knowledge leads to an object contrary to the object of the knowledge; 
<A NAME="588"></A>but what is primary has no contrary. <BR><BR>"Again, if besides sensible 
<A NAME="589"></A>things no others exist, there will be no first principle, no order, no 
<A NAME="590"></A>becoming, no heavenly bodies, but each principle will have a principle 
<A NAME="591"></A>before it, as in the accounts of the theologians and all the natural philosophers. 
<A NAME="592"></A>But if the Forms or the numbers are to exist, they will be causes of nothing; 
<A NAME="593"></A>or if not that, at least not of movement. Further, how is extension, i.e. 
<A NAME="594"></A>a continuum, to be produced out of unextended parts? For number will not, 
<A NAME="595"></A>either as mover or as form, produce a continuum. But again there cannot 
<A NAME="596"></A>be any contrary that is also essentially a productive or moving principle; 
<A NAME="597"></A>for it would be possible for it not to be. Or at least its action would 
<A NAME="598"></A>be posterior to its potency. The world, then, would not be eternal. But 
<A NAME="599"></A>it is; one of these premisses, then, must be denied. And we have said how 
<A NAME="600"></A>this must be done. Further, in virtue of what the numbers, or the soul 
<A NAME="601"></A>and the body, or in general the form and the thing, are one-of this no 
<A NAME="602"></A>one tells us anything; nor can any one tell, unless he says, as we do, 
<A NAME="603"></A>that the mover makes them one. And those who say mathematical number is 
<A NAME="604"></A>first and go on to generate one kind of substance after another and give 
<A NAME="605"></A>different principles for each, make the substance of the universe a mere 
<A NAME="606"></A>series of episodes (for one substance has no influence on another by its 
<A NAME="607"></A>existence or nonexistence), and they give us many governing principles; 
<A NAME="608"></A>but the world refuses to be governed badly. "<BR><BR>
