<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Let us explain the nature of the sea and the reason why such a large mass 
<A NAME="12"></A>of water is salt and the way in which it originally came to 
<A NAME="13"></A>be.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>The old writers who invented theogonies say that the sea has springs, 
<A NAME="15"></A>for they want earth and sea to have foundations and roots of their own. 
<A NAME="16"></A>Presumably they thought that this view was grander and more impressive 
<A NAME="17"></A>as implying that our earth was an important part of the universe. For they 
<A NAME="18"></A>believed that the whole world had been built up round our earth and for 
<A NAME="19"></A>its sake, and that the earth was the most important and primary part of 
<A NAME="20"></A>it. Others, wiser in human knowledge, give an account of its origin. At 
<A NAME="21"></A>first, they say, the earth was surrounded by moisture. Then the sun began 
<A NAME="22"></A>to dry it up, part of it evaporated and is the cause of winds and the turnings 
<A NAME="23"></A>back of the sun and the moon, while the remainder forms the sea. So the 
<A NAME="24"></A>sea is being dried up and is growing less, and will end by being some day 
<A NAME="25"></A>entirely dried up. Others say that the sea is a kind of sweat exuded by 
<A NAME="26"></A>the earth when the sun heats it, and that this explains its saltness: for 
<A NAME="27"></A>all sweat is salt. Others say that the saltness is due to the earth. Just 
<A NAME="28"></A>as water strained through ashes becomes salt, so the sea owes its saltness 
<A NAME="29"></A>to the admixture of earth with similar properties.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>We must now consider the facts which prove that the sea cannot 
<A NAME="31"></A>possibly have springs. The waters we find on the earth either flow or are 
<A NAME="32"></A>stationary. All flowing water has springs. (By a spring, as we have explained 
<A NAME="33"></A>above, we must not understand a source from which waters are ladled as 
<A NAME="34"></A>it were from a vessel, but a first point at which the water which is continually 
<A NAME="35"></A>forming and percolating gathers.) Stationary water is either that which 
<A NAME="36"></A>has collected and has been left standing, marshy pools, for instance, and 
<A NAME="37"></A>lakes, which differ merely in size, or else it comes from springs. In this 
<A NAME="38"></A>case it is always artificial, I mean as in the case of wells, otherwise 
<A NAME="39"></A>the spring would have to be above the outlet. Hence the water from fountains 
<A NAME="40"></A>and rivers flows of itself, whereas wells need to be worked artificially. 
<A NAME="41"></A>All the waters that exist belong to one or other of these 
<A NAME="42"></A>classes.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>On the basis of this division we can sec that the sea cannot have 
<A NAME="44"></A>springs. For it falls under neither of the two classes; it does not flow 
<A NAME="45"></A>and it is not artificial; whereas all water from springs must belong to 
<A NAME="46"></A>one or other of them. Natural standing water from springs is never found 
<A NAME="47"></A>on such a large scale.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>Again, there are several seas that have no communication with one 
<A NAME="49"></A>another at all. The Red Sea, for instance, communicates but slightly with 
<A NAME="50"></A>the ocean outside the straits, and the Hyrcanian and Caspian seas are distinct 
<A NAME="51"></A>from this ocean and people dwell all round them. Hence, if these seas had 
<A NAME="52"></A>had any springs anywhere they must have been discovered.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>It is true that in straits, where the land on either side contracts 
<A NAME="54"></A>an open sea into a small space, the sea appears to flow. But this is because 
<A NAME="55"></A>it is swinging to and fro. In the open sea this motion is not observed, 
<A NAME="56"></A>but where the land narrows and contracts the sea the motion that was imperceptible 
<A NAME="57"></A>in the open necessarily strikes the attention.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>The whole of the Mediterranean does actually flow. The direction 
<A NAME="59"></A>of this flow is determined by the depth of the basins and by the number 
<A NAME="60"></A>of rivers. Maeotis flows into Pontus and Pontus into the Aegean. After 
<A NAME="61"></A>that the flow of the remaining seas is not so easy to observe. The current 
<A NAME="62"></A>of Maeotis and Pontus is due to the number of rivers (more rivers flow 
<A NAME="63"></A>into the Euxine and Maeotis than into the whole Mediterranean with its 
<A NAME="64"></A>much larger basin), and to their own shallowness. For we find the sea getting 
<A NAME="65"></A>deeper and deeper. Pontus is deeper than Maeotis, the Aegean than Pontus, 
<A NAME="66"></A>the Sicilian sea than the Aegean; the Sardinian and Tyrrhenic being the 
<A NAME="67"></A>deepest of all. (Outside the pillars of Heracles the sea is shallow owing 
<A NAME="68"></A>to the mud, but calm, for it lies in a hollow.) We see, then, that just 
<A NAME="69"></A>as single rivers flow from mountains, so it is with the earth as a whole: 
<A NAME="70"></A>the greatest volume of water flows from the higher regions in the north. 
<A NAME="71"></A>Their alluvium makes the northern seas shallow, while the outer seas are 
<A NAME="72"></A>deeper. Some further evidence of the height of the northern regions of 
<A NAME="73"></A>the earth is afforded by the view of many of the ancient meteorologists. 
<A NAME="74"></A>They believed that the sun did not pass below the earth, but round its 
<A NAME="75"></A>northern part, and that it was the height of this which obscured the sun 
<A NAME="76"></A>and caused night.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>So much to prove that there cannot be sources of the sea and to 
<A NAME="78"></A>explain its observed flow.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="79"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="80"></A><BR><BR>We must now discuss the origin of the sea, if it has an origin, 
<A NAME="81"></A>and the cause of its salt and bitter taste.
<A NAME="82"></A><BR><BR>What made earlier writers consider the sea to be the original and 
<A NAME="83"></A>main body of water is this. It seems reasonable to suppose that to be the 
<A NAME="84"></A>case on the analogy of the other elements. Each of them has a main bulk 
<A NAME="85"></A>which by reason of its mass is the origin of that element, and any parts 
<A NAME="86"></A>which change and mix with the other elements come from it. Thus the main 
<A NAME="87"></A>body of fire is in the upper region; that of air occupies the place next 
<A NAME="88"></A>inside the region of fire; while the mass of the earth is that round which 
<A NAME="89"></A>the rest of the elements are seen to lie. So we must clearly look for something 
<A NAME="90"></A>analogous in the case of water. But here we can find no such single mass, 
<A NAME="91"></A>as in the case of the other elements, except the sea. River water is not 
<A NAME="92"></A>a unity, nor is it stable, but is seen to be in a continuous process of 
<A NAME="93"></A>becoming from day to day. It was this difficulty which made people regard 
<A NAME="94"></A>the sea as the origin and source of moisture and of all water. And so we 
<A NAME="95"></A>find it maintained that rivers not only flow into the sea but originate 
<A NAME="96"></A>from it, the salt water becoming sweet by filtration.
<A NAME="97"></A><BR><BR>But this view involves another difficulty. If this body of water 
<A NAME="98"></A>is the origin and source of all water, why is it salt and not sweet? The 
<A NAME="99"></A>reason for this, besides answering this question, will ensure our having 
<A NAME="100"></A>a right first conception of the nature of the sea.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>The earth is surrounded by water, just as that is by the sphere 
<A NAME="102"></A>of air, and that again by the sphere called that of fire (which is the 
<A NAME="103"></A>outermost both on the common view and on ours). Now the sun, moving as 
<A NAME="104"></A>it does, sets up processes of change and becoming and decay, and by its 
<A NAME="105"></A>agency the finest and sweetest water is every day carried up and is dissolved 
<A NAME="106"></A>into vapour and rises to the upper region, where it is condensed again 
<A NAME="107"></A>by the cold and so returns to the earth. This, as we have said before, 
<A NAME="108"></A>is the regular course of nature.
<A NAME="109"></A><BR><BR>Hence all my predecessors who supposed that the sun was nourished 
<A NAME="110"></A>by moisture are absurdly mistaken. Some go on to say that the solstices 
<A NAME="111"></A>are due to this, the reason being that the same places cannot always supply 
<A NAME="112"></A>the sun with nourishment and that without it he must perish. For the fire 
<A NAME="113"></A>we are familiar with lives as long as it is fed, and the only food for 
<A NAME="114"></A>fire is moisture. As if the moisture that is raised could reach the sun! 
<A NAME="115"></A>or this ascent were really like that performed by flame as it comes into 
<A NAME="116"></A>being, and to which they supposed the case of the sun to be analogous! 
<A NAME="117"></A>Really there is no similarity. A flame is a process of becoming, involving 
<A NAME="118"></A>a constant interchange of moist and dry. It cannot be said to be nourished 
<A NAME="119"></A>since it scarcely persists as one and the same for a moment. This cannot 
<A NAME="120"></A>be true of the sun; for if it were nourished like that, as they say it 
<A NAME="121"></A>is, we should obviously not only have a new sun every day, as Heraclitus 
<A NAME="122"></A>says, but a new sun every moment. Again, when the sun causes the moisture 
<A NAME="123"></A>to rise, this is like fire heating water. So, as the fire is not fed by 
<A NAME="124"></A>the water above it, it is absurd to suppose that the sun feeds on that 
<A NAME="125"></A>moisture, even if its heat made all the water in the world evaporate. Again, 
<A NAME="126"></A>it is absurd, considering the number and size of the stars, that these 
<A NAME="127"></A>thinkers should consider the sun only and overlook the question how the 
<A NAME="128"></A>rest of the heavenly bodies subsist. Again, they are met by the same difficulty 
<A NAME="129"></A>as those who say that at first the earth itself was moist and the world 
<A NAME="130"></A>round the earth was warmed by the sun, and so air was generated and the 
<A NAME="131"></A>whole firmament grew, and the air caused winds and solstices. The objection 
<A NAME="132"></A>is that we always plainly see the water that has been carried up coming 
<A NAME="133"></A>down again. Even if the same amount does not come back in a year or in 
<A NAME="134"></A>a given country, yet in a certain period all that has been carried up is 
<A NAME="135"></A>returned. This implies that the celestial bodies do not feed on it, and 
<A NAME="136"></A>that we cannot distinguish between some air which preserves its character 
<A NAME="137"></A>once it is generated and some other which is generated but becomes water 
<A NAME="138"></A>again and so perishes; on the contrary, all the moisture alike is dissolved 
<A NAME="139"></A>and all of it condensed back into water.
<A NAME="140"></A><BR><BR>The drinkable, sweet water, then, is light and is all of it drawn 
<A NAME="141"></A>up: the salt water is heavy and remains behind, but not in its natural 
<A NAME="142"></A>place. For this is a question which has been sufficiently discussed (I 
<A NAME="143"></A>mean about the natural place that water, like the other elements, must 
<A NAME="144"></A>in reason have), and the answer is this. The place which we see the sea 
<A NAME="145"></A>filling is not its natural place but that of water. It seems to belong 
<A NAME="146"></A>to the sea because the weight of the salt water makes it remain there, 
<A NAME="147"></A>while the sweet, drinkable water which is light is carried up. The same 
<A NAME="148"></A>thing happens in animal bodies. Here, too, the food when it enters the 
<A NAME="149"></A>body is sweet, yet the residuum and dregs of liquid food are found to be 
<A NAME="150"></A>bitter and salt. This is because the sweet and drinkable part of it has 
<A NAME="151"></A>been drawn away by the natural animal heat and has passed into the flesh 
<A NAME="152"></A>and the other parts of the body according to their several natures. Now 
<A NAME="153"></A>just as here it would be wrong for any one to refuse to call the belly 
<A NAME="154"></A>the place of liquid food because that disappears from it soon, and to call 
<A NAME="155"></A>it the place of the residuum because this is seen to remain, so in the 
<A NAME="156"></A>case of our present subject. This place, we say, is the place of water. 
<A NAME="157"></A>Hence all rivers and all the water that is generated flow into it: for 
<A NAME="158"></A>water flows into the deepest place, and the deepest part of the earth is 
<A NAME="159"></A>filled by the sea. Only all the light and sweet part of it is quickly carried 
<A NAME="160"></A>off by the sun, while herest remains for the reason we have explained. 
<A NAME="161"></A>It is quite natural that some people should have been puzzled by the old 
<A NAME="162"></A>question why such a mass of water leaves no trace anywhere (for the sea 
<A NAME="163"></A>does not increase though innumerable and vast rivers are flowing into it 
<A NAME="164"></A>every day.) But if one considers the matter the solution is easy. The same 
<A NAME="165"></A>amount of water does not take as long to dry up when it is spread out as 
<A NAME="166"></A>when it is gathered in a body, and indeed the difference is so great that 
<A NAME="167"></A>in the one case it might persist the whole day long while in the other 
<A NAME="168"></A>it might all disappear in a moment-as for instance if one were to spread 
<A NAME="169"></A>out a cup of water over a large table. This is the case with the rivers: 
<A NAME="170"></A>all the time they are flowing their water forms a compact mass, but when 
<A NAME="171"></A>it arrives at a vast wide place it quickly and imperceptibly 
<A NAME="172"></A>evaporates.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>But the theory of the Phaedo about rivers and the sea is impossible. 
<A NAME="174"></A>There it is said that the earth is pierced by intercommunicating channels 
<A NAME="175"></A>and that the original head and source of all waters is what is called Tartarus-a 
<A NAME="176"></A>mass of water about the centre, from which all waters, flowing and standing, 
<A NAME="177"></A>are derived. This primary and original water is always surging to and fro, 
<A NAME="178"></A>and so it causes the rivers to flow on this side of the earth's centre 
<A NAME="179"></A>and on that; for it has no fixed seat but is always oscillating about the 
<A NAME="180"></A>centre. Its motion up and down is what fills rivers. Many of these form 
<A NAME="181"></A>lakes in various places (our sea is an instance of one of these), but all 
<A NAME="182"></A>of them come round again in a circle to the original source of their flow, 
<A NAME="183"></A>many at the same point, but some at a point opposite to that from which 
<A NAME="184"></A>they issued; for instance, if they started from the other side of the earth's 
<A NAME="185"></A>centre, they might return from this side of it. They descend only as far 
<A NAME="186"></A>as the centre, for after that all motion is upwards. Water gets its tastes 
<A NAME="187"></A>and colours from the kind of earth the rivers happened to flow 
<A NAME="188"></A>through.
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>But on this theory rivers do not always flow in the same sense. 
<A NAME="190"></A>For since they flow to the centre from which they issue forth they will 
<A NAME="191"></A>not be flowing down any more than up, but in whatever direction the surging 
<A NAME="192"></A>of Tartarus inclines to. But at this rate we shall get the proverbial rivers 
<A NAME="193"></A>flowing upwards, which is impossible. Again, where is the water that is 
<A NAME="194"></A>generated and what goes up again as vapour to come from? For this must 
<A NAME="195"></A>all of it simply be ignored, since the quantity of water is always the 
<A NAME="196"></A>same and all the water that flows out from the original source flows back 
<A NAME="197"></A>to it again. This itself is not true, since all rivers are seen to end 
<A NAME="198"></A>in the sea except where one flows into another. Not one of them ends in 
<A NAME="199"></A>the earth, but even when one is swallowed up it comes to the surface again. 
<A NAME="200"></A>And those rivers are large which flow for a long distance through a lowying 
<A NAME="201"></A>country, for by their situation and length they cut off the course of many 
<A NAME="202"></A>others and swallow them up. This is why the Istrus and the Nile are the 
<A NAME="203"></A>greatest of the rivers which flow into our sea. Indeed, so many rivers 
<A NAME="204"></A>fall into them that there is disagreement as to the sources of them both. 
<A NAME="205"></A>All of which is plainly impossible on the theory, and the more so as it 
<A NAME="206"></A>derives the sea from Tartarus.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>Enough has been said to prove that this is the natural place of 
<A NAME="208"></A>water and not of the sea, and to explain why sweet water is only found 
<A NAME="209"></A>in rivers, while salt water is stationary, and to show that the sea is 
<A NAME="210"></A>the end rather than the source of water, analogous to the residual matter 
<A NAME="211"></A>of all food, and especially liquid food, in animal bodies.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="212"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>We must now explain why the sea is salt, and ask whether it eternally 
<A NAME="214"></A>exists as identically the same body, or whether it did not exist at all 
<A NAME="215"></A>once and some day will exist no longer, but will dry up as some people 
<A NAME="216"></A>think.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>Every one admits this, that if the whole world originated the sea 
<A NAME="218"></A>did too; for they make them come into being at the same time. It follows 
<A NAME="219"></A>that if the universe is eternal the same must be true of the sea. Any one 
<A NAME="220"></A>who thinks like Democritus that the sea is diminishing and will disappear 
<A NAME="221"></A>in the end reminds us of Aesop's tales. His story was that Charybdis had 
<A NAME="222"></A>twice sucked in the sea: the first time she made the mountains visible; 
<A NAME="223"></A>the second time the islands; and when she sucks it in for the last time 
<A NAME="224"></A>she will dry it up entirely. Such a tale is appropriate enough to Aesop 
<A NAME="225"></A>in a rage with the ferryman, but not to serious inquirers. Whatever made 
<A NAME="226"></A>the sea remain at first, whether it was its weight, as some even of those 
<A NAME="227"></A>who hold these views say (for it is easy to see the cause here), or some 
<A NAME="228"></A>other reason-clearly the same thing must make it persist for ever. They 
<A NAME="229"></A>must either deny that the water raised by the sun will return at all, or, 
<A NAME="230"></A>if it does, they must admit that the sea persists for ever or as long as 
<A NAME="231"></A>this process goes on, and again, that for the same period of time that 
<A NAME="232"></A>sweet water must have been carried up beforehand. So the sea will never 
<A NAME="233"></A>dry up: for before that can happen the water that has gone up beforehand 
<A NAME="234"></A>will return to it: for if you say that this happens once you must admit 
<A NAME="235"></A>its recurrence. If you stop the sun's course there is no drying agency. 
<A NAME="236"></A>If you let it go on it will draw up the sweet water as we have said whenever 
<A NAME="237"></A>it approaches, and let it descend again when it recedes. This notion about 
<A NAME="238"></A>the sea is derived from the fact that many places are found to be drier 
<A NAME="239"></A>now than they once were. Why this is so we have explained. The phenomenon 
<A NAME="240"></A>is due to temporary excess of rain and not to any process of becoming in 
<A NAME="241"></A>which the universe or its parts are involved. Some day the opposite will 
<A NAME="242"></A>take place and after that the earth will grow dry once again. We must recognize 
<A NAME="243"></A>that this process always goes on thus in a cycle, for that is more satisfactory 
<A NAME="244"></A>than to suppose a change in the whole world in order to explain these facts. 
<A NAME="245"></A>But we have dwelt longer on this point than it deserves.
<A NAME="246"></A><BR><BR>To return to the saltness of the sea: those who create the sea 
<A NAME="247"></A>once for all, or indeed generate it at all, cannot account for its saltness. 
<A NAME="248"></A>It makes no difference whether the sea is the residue of all the moisture 
<A NAME="249"></A>that is about the earth and has been drawn up by the sun, or whether all 
<A NAME="250"></A>the flavour existing in the whole mass of sweet water is due to the admixture 
<A NAME="251"></A>of a certain kind of earth. Since the total volume of the sea is the same 
<A NAME="252"></A>once the water that evaporated has returned, it follows that it must either 
<A NAME="253"></A>have been salt at first too, or, if not at first, then not now either. 
<A NAME="254"></A>If it was salt from the very beginning, then we want to know why that was 
<A NAME="255"></A>so; and why, if salt water was drawn up then, that is not the case 
<A NAME="256"></A>now.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>Again, if it is maintained that an admixture of earth makes the 
<A NAME="258"></A>sea salt (for they say that earth has many flavours and is washed down 
<A NAME="259"></A>by the rivers and so makes the sea salt by its admixture), it is strange 
<A NAME="260"></A>that rivers should not be salt too. How can the admixture of this earth 
<A NAME="261"></A>have such a striking effect in a great quantity of water and not in each 
<A NAME="262"></A>river singly? For the sea, differing in nothing from rivers but in being 
<A NAME="263"></A>salt, is evidently simply the totality of river water, and the rivers are 
<A NAME="264"></A>the vehicle in which that earth is carried to their common 
<A NAME="265"></A>destination.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>It is equally absurd to suppose that anything has been explained 
<A NAME="267"></A>by calling the sea 'the sweat of the earth', like Empedicles. Metaphors 
<A NAME="268"></A>are poetical and so that expression of his may satisfy the requirements 
<A NAME="269"></A>of a poem, but as a scientific theory it is unsatisfactory. Even in the 
<A NAME="270"></A>case of the body it is a question how the sweet liquid drunk becomes salt 
<A NAME="271"></A>sweat whether it is merely by the departure of some element in it which 
<A NAME="272"></A>is sweetest, or by the admixture of something, as when water is strained 
<A NAME="273"></A>through ashes. Actually the saltness seems to be due to the same cause 
<A NAME="274"></A>as in the case of the residual liquid that gathers in the bladder. That, 
<A NAME="275"></A>too, becomes bitter and salt though the liquid we drink and that contained 
<A NAME="276"></A>in our food is sweet. If then the bitterness is due in these cases (as 
<A NAME="277"></A>with the water strained through lye) to the presence of a certain sort 
<A NAME="278"></A>of stuff that is carried along by the urine (as indeed we actually find 
<A NAME="279"></A>a salt deposit settling in chamber-pots) and is secreted from the flesh 
<A NAME="280"></A>in sweat (as if the departing moisture were washing the stuff out of the 
<A NAME="281"></A>body), then no doubt the admixture of something earthy with the water is 
<A NAME="282"></A>what makes the sea salt.
<A NAME="283"></A><BR><BR>Now in the body stuff of this kind, viz. the sediment of food, 
<A NAME="284"></A>is due to failure to digest: but how there came to be any such thing in 
<A NAME="285"></A>the earth requires explanation. Besides, how can the drying and warming 
<A NAME="286"></A>of the earth cause the secretion such a great quantity of water; especially 
<A NAME="287"></A>as that must be a mere fragment of what is left in the earth? Again, waiving 
<A NAME="288"></A>the question of quantity, why does not the earth sweat now when it happens 
<A NAME="289"></A>to be in process of drying? If it did so then, it ought to do so now. But 
<A NAME="290"></A>it does not: on the contrary, when it is dry it graws moist, but when it 
<A NAME="291"></A>is moist it does not secrete anything at all. How then was it possible 
<A NAME="292"></A>for the earth at the beginning when it was moist to sweat as it grew dry? 
<A NAME="293"></A>Indeed, the theory that maintains that most of the moisture departed and 
<A NAME="294"></A>was drawn up by the sun and that what was left over is the sea is more 
<A NAME="295"></A>reasonable; but for the earth to sweat when it is moist is 
<A NAME="296"></A>impossible.
<A NAME="297"></A><BR><BR>Since all the attempts to account for the saltness of the sea seem 
<A NAME="298"></A>unsuccessful let us explain it by the help of the principle we have used 
<A NAME="299"></A>already.
<A NAME="300"></A><BR><BR>Since we recognize two kinds of evaporation, one moist, the other 
<A NAME="301"></A>dry, it is clear that the latter must be recognized as the source of phenomena 
<A NAME="302"></A>like those we are concerned with.
<A NAME="303"></A><BR><BR>But there is a question which we must discuss first. Does the sea 
<A NAME="304"></A>always remain numerically one and consisting of the same parts, or is it, 
<A NAME="305"></A>too, one in form and volume while its parts are in continual change, like 
<A NAME="306"></A>air and sweet water and fire? All of these are in a constant state of change, 
<A NAME="307"></A>but the form and the quantity of each of them are fixed, just as they are 
<A NAME="308"></A>in the case of a flowing river or a burning flame. The answer is clear, 
<A NAME="309"></A>and there is no doubt that the same account holds good of all these things 
<A NAME="310"></A>alike. They differ in that some of them change more rapidly or more slowly 
<A NAME="311"></A>than others; and they all are involved in a process of perishing and becoming 
<A NAME="312"></A>which yet affects them all in a regular course.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>This being so we must go on to try to explain why the sea is salt. 
<A NAME="314"></A>There are many facts which make it clear that this taste is due to the 
<A NAME="315"></A>admixture of something. First, in animal bodies what is least digested, 
<A NAME="316"></A>the residue of liquid food, is salt and bitter, as we said before. All 
<A NAME="317"></A>animal excreta are undigested, but especially that which gathers in the 
<A NAME="318"></A>bladder (its extreme lightness proves this; for everything that is digested 
<A NAME="319"></A>is condensed), and also sweat; in these then is excreted (along with other 
<A NAME="320"></A>matter) an identical substance to which this flavour is due. The case of 
<A NAME="321"></A>things burnt is analogous. What heat fails to assimilate becomes the excrementary 
<A NAME="322"></A>residue in animal bodies, and, in things burnt, ashes. That is why some 
<A NAME="323"></A>people say that it was burnt earth that made the sea salt. To say that 
<A NAME="324"></A>it was burnt earth is absurd; but to say that it was something like burnt 
<A NAME="325"></A>earth is true. We must suppose that just as in the cases we have described, 
<A NAME="326"></A>so in the world as a whole, everything that grows and is naturally generated 
<A NAME="327"></A>always leaves an undigested residue, like that of things burnt, consisting 
<A NAME="328"></A>of this sort of earth. All the earthy stuff in the dry exhalation is of 
<A NAME="329"></A>this nature, and it is the dry exhalation which accounts for its great 
<A NAME="330"></A>quantity. Now since, as we have said, the moist and the dry evaporations 
<A NAME="331"></A>are mixed, some quantity of this stuff must always be included in the clouds 
<A NAME="332"></A>and the water that are formed by condensation, and must redescend to the 
<A NAME="333"></A>earth in rain. This process must always go on with such regularity as the 
<A NAME="334"></A>sublunary world admits of. and it is the answer to the question how the 
<A NAME="335"></A>sea comes to be salt.
<A NAME="336"></A><BR><BR>It also explains why rain that comes from the south, and the first 
<A NAME="337"></A>rains of autumn, are brackish. The south is the warmest of winds and it 
<A NAME="338"></A>blows from dry and hot regions. Hence it carries little moist vapour and 
<A NAME="339"></A>that is why it is hot. (It makes no difference even if this is not its 
<A NAME="340"></A>true character and it is originally a cold wind, for it becomes warm on 
<A NAME="341"></A>its way by incorporating with itself a great quantity of dry evaporation 
<A NAME="342"></A>from the places it passes over.) The north wind, on the other hand, comb 
<A NAME="343"></A>ing from moist regions, is full of vapour and therefore cold. It is dry 
<A NAME="344"></A>in our part of the world because it drives the clouds away before it, but 
<A NAME="345"></A>in the south it is rainy; just as the south is a dry wind in Libya. So 
<A NAME="346"></A>the south wind charges the rain that falls with a great quantity of this 
<A NAME="347"></A>stuff. Autumn rain is brackish because the heaviest water must fall first; 
<A NAME="348"></A>so that that which contains the greatest quantity of this kind of earth 
<A NAME="349"></A>descends quickest.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>This, too, is why the sea is warm. Everything that has been exposed 
<A NAME="351"></A>to fire contains heat potentially, as we see in the case of lye and ashes 
<A NAME="352"></A>and the dry and liquid excreta of animals. Indeed those animals which are 
<A NAME="353"></A>hottest in the belly have the hottest excreta.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>The action of this cause is continually making the sea more salt, 
<A NAME="355"></A>but some part of its saltness is always being drawn up with the sweet water. 
<A NAME="356"></A>This is less than the sweet water in the same ratio in which the salt and 
<A NAME="357"></A>brackish element in rain is less than the sweet, and so the saltness of 
<A NAME="358"></A>the sea remains constant on the whole. Salt water when it turns into vapour 
<A NAME="359"></A>becomes sweet, and the vapour does not form salt water when it condenses 
<A NAME="360"></A>again. This I know by experiment. The same thing is true in every case 
<A NAME="361"></A>of the kind: wine and all fluids that evaporate and condense back into 
<A NAME="362"></A>a liquid state become water. They all are water modified by a certain admixture, 
<A NAME="363"></A>the nature of which determines their flavour. But this subject must be 
<A NAME="364"></A>considered on another more suitable occasion.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>For the present let us say this. The sea is there and some of it 
<A NAME="366"></A>is continually being drawn up and becoming sweet; this returns from above 
<A NAME="367"></A>with the rain. But it is now different from what it was when it was drawn 
<A NAME="368"></A>up, and its weight makes it sink below the sweet water. This process prevents 
<A NAME="369"></A>the sea, as it does rivers, from drying up except from local causes (this 
<A NAME="370"></A>must happen to sea and rivers alike). On the other hand the parts neither 
<A NAME="371"></A>of the earth nor of the sea remain constant but only their whole bulk. 
<A NAME="372"></A>For the same thing is true of the earth as of the sea: some of it is carried 
<A NAME="373"></A>up and some comes down with the rain, and both that which remains on the 
<A NAME="374"></A>surface and that which comes down again change their 
<A NAME="375"></A>situations.
<A NAME="376"></A><BR><BR>There is more evidence to prove that saltness is due to the admixture 
<A NAME="377"></A>of some substance, besides that which we have adduced. Make a vessel of 
<A NAME="378"></A>wax and put it in the sea, fastening its mouth in such a way as to prevent 
<A NAME="379"></A>any water getting in. Then the water that percolates through the wax sides 
<A NAME="380"></A>of the vessel is sweet, the earthy stuff, the admixture of which makes 
<A NAME="381"></A>the water salt, being separated off as it were by a filter. It is this 
<A NAME="382"></A>stuff which make salt water heavy (it weighs more than fresh water) and 
<A NAME="383"></A>thick. The difference in consistency is such that ships with the same cargo 
<A NAME="384"></A>very nearly sink in a river when they are quite fit to navigate in the 
<A NAME="385"></A>sea. This circumstance has before now caused loss to shippers freighting 
<A NAME="386"></A>their ships in a river. That the thicker consistency is due to an admixture 
<A NAME="387"></A>of something is proved by the fact that if you make strong brine by the 
<A NAME="388"></A>admixture of salt, eggs, even when they are full, float in it. It almost 
<A NAME="389"></A>becomes like mud; such a quantity of earthy matter is there in the sea. 
<A NAME="390"></A>The same thing is done in salting fish.
<A NAME="391"></A><BR><BR>Again if, as is fabled, there is a lake in Palestine, such that 
<A NAME="392"></A>if you bind a man or beast and throw it in it floats and does not sink, 
<A NAME="393"></A>this would bear out what we have said. They say that this lake is so bitter 
<A NAME="394"></A>and salt that no fish live in it and that if you soak clothes in it and 
<A NAME="395"></A>shake them it cleans them. The following facts all of them support our 
<A NAME="396"></A>theory that it is some earthy stuff in the water which makes it salt. In 
<A NAME="397"></A>Chaonia there is a spring of brackish water that flows into a neighbouring 
<A NAME="398"></A>river which is sweet but contains no fish. The local story is that when 
<A NAME="399"></A>Heracles came from Erytheia driving the oxen and gave the inhabitants the 
<A NAME="400"></A>choice, they chose salt in preference to fish. They get the salt from the 
<A NAME="401"></A>spring. They boil off some of the water and let the rest stand; when it 
<A NAME="402"></A>has cooled and the heat and moisture have evaporated together it gives 
<A NAME="403"></A>them salt, not in lumps but loose and light like snow. It is weaker than 
<A NAME="404"></A>ordinary salt and added freely gives a sweet taste, and it is not as white 
<A NAME="405"></A>as salt generally is. Another instance of this is found in Umbria. There 
<A NAME="406"></A>is a place there where reeds and rushes grow. They burn some of these, 
<A NAME="407"></A>put the ashes into water and boil it off. When a little water is left and 
<A NAME="408"></A>has cooled it gives a quantity of salt.
<A NAME="409"></A><BR><BR>Most salt rivers and springs must once have been hot. Then the 
<A NAME="410"></A>original fire in them was extinguished but the earth through which they 
<A NAME="411"></A>percolate preserves the character of lye or ashes. Springs and rivers with 
<A NAME="412"></A>all kinds of flavours are found in many places. These flavours must in 
<A NAME="413"></A>every case be due to the fire that is or was in them, for if you expose 
<A NAME="414"></A>earth to different degrees of heat it assumes various kinds and shades 
<A NAME="415"></A>of flavour. It becomes full of alum and lye and other things of the kind, 
<A NAME="416"></A>and the fresh water percolates through these and changes its character. 
<A NAME="417"></A>Sometimes it becomes acid as in Sicania, a part of Sicily. There they get 
<A NAME="418"></A>a salt and acid water which they use as vinegar to season some of their 
<A NAME="419"></A>dishes. In the neighbourhood of Lyncus, too, there is a spring of acid 
<A NAME="420"></A>water, and in Scythia a bitter spring. The water from this makes the whole 
<A NAME="421"></A>of the river into which it flows bitter. These differences are explained 
<A NAME="422"></A>by a knowledge of the particular mixtures that determine different savours. 
<A NAME="423"></A>But these have been explained in another treatise.
<A NAME="424"></A><BR><BR>We have now given an account of waters and the sea, why they persist, 
<A NAME="425"></A>how they change, what their nature is, and have explained most of their 
<A NAME="426"></A>natural operations and affections.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="427"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="428"></A><BR><BR>Let us proceed to the theory of winds. Its basis is a distinction 
<A NAME="429"></A>we have already made. We recognize two kinds of evaporation, one moist, 
<A NAME="430"></A>the other dry. The former is called vapour: for the other there is no general 
<A NAME="431"></A>name but we must call it a sort of smoke, applying to the whole of it a 
<A NAME="432"></A>word that is proper to one of its forms. The moist cannot exist without 
<A NAME="433"></A>the dry nor the dry without the moist: whenever we speak of either we mean 
<A NAME="434"></A>that it predominates. Now when the sun in its circular course approaches, 
<A NAME="435"></A>it draws up by its heat the moist evaporation: when it recedes the cold 
<A NAME="436"></A>makes the vapour that had been raised condense back into water which falls 
<A NAME="437"></A>and is distributed through the earth. (This explains why there is more 
<A NAME="438"></A>rain in winter and more by night than by day: though the fact is not recognized 
<A NAME="439"></A>because rain by night is more apt to escape observation than by day.) But 
<A NAME="440"></A>there is a great quantity of fire and heat in the earth, and the sun not 
<A NAME="441"></A>only draws up the moisture that lies on the surface of it, but warms and 
<A NAME="442"></A>dries the earth itself. Consequently, since there are two kinds of evaporation, 
<A NAME="443"></A>as we have said, one like vapour, the other like smoke, both of them are 
<A NAME="444"></A>necessarily generated. That in which moisture predominates is the source 
<A NAME="445"></A>of rain, as we explained before, while the dry evaporation is the source 
<A NAME="446"></A>and substance of all winds. That things must necessarily take this course 
<A NAME="447"></A>is clear from the resulting phenomena themselves, for the evaporation that 
<A NAME="448"></A>is to produce them must necessarily differ; and the sun and the warmth 
<A NAME="449"></A>in the earth not only can but must produce these evaporations.
<A NAME="450"></A><BR><BR>Since the two evaporations are specifically distinct, wind and 
<A NAME="451"></A>rain obviously differ and their substance is not the same, as those say 
<A NAME="452"></A>who maintain that one and the same air when in motion is wind, but when 
<A NAME="453"></A>it condenses again is water. Air, as we have explained in an earlier book, 
<A NAME="454"></A>is made up of these as constituents. Vapour is moist and cold (for its 
<A NAME="455"></A>fluidity is due to its moistness, and because it derives from water it 
<A NAME="456"></A>is naturally cold, like water that has not been warmed): whereas the smoky 
<A NAME="457"></A>evaporation is hot and dry. Hence each contributes a part, and air is moist 
<A NAME="458"></A>and hot. It is absurd that this air that surrounds us should become wind 
<A NAME="459"></A>when in motion, whatever be the source of its motion on the contrary the 
<A NAME="460"></A>case of winds is like that of rivers. We do not call water that flows anyhow 
<A NAME="461"></A>a river, even if there is a great quantity of it, but only if the flow 
<A NAME="462"></A>comes from a spring. So too with the winds; a great quantity of air might 
<A NAME="463"></A>be moved by the fall of some large object without flowing from any source 
<A NAME="464"></A>or spring.
<A NAME="465"></A><BR><BR>The facts bear out our theory. It is because the evaporation takes 
<A NAME="466"></A>place uninterruptedly but differs in degree and quantity that clouds and 
<A NAME="467"></A>winds appear in their natural proportion according to the season; and it 
<A NAME="468"></A>is because there is now a great excess of the vaporous, now of the dry 
<A NAME="469"></A>and smoky exhalation, that some years are rainy and wet, others windy and 
<A NAME="470"></A>dry. Sometimes there is much drought or rain, and it prevails over a great 
<A NAME="471"></A>and continuous stretch of country. At other times it is local; the surrounding 
<A NAME="472"></A>country often getting seasonable or even excessive rains while there is 
<A NAME="473"></A>drought in a certain part; or, contrariwise, all the surrounding country 
<A NAME="474"></A>gets little or even no rain while a certain part gets rain in abundance. 
<A NAME="475"></A>The reason for all this is that while the same affection is generally apt 
<A NAME="476"></A>to prevail over a considerable district because adjacent places (unless 
<A NAME="477"></A>there is something special to differentiate them) stand in the same relation 
<A NAME="478"></A>to the sun, yet on occasion the dry evaporation will prevail in one part 
<A NAME="479"></A>and the moist in another, or conversely. Again the reason for this latter 
<A NAME="480"></A>is that each evaporation goes over to that of the neighbouring district: 
<A NAME="481"></A>for instance, the dry evaporation circulates in its own place while the 
<A NAME="482"></A>moist migrates to the next district or is even driven by winds to some 
<A NAME="483"></A>distant place: or else the moist evaporation remains and the dry moves 
<A NAME="484"></A>away. Just as in the case of the body when the stomach is dry the lower 
<A NAME="485"></A>belly is often in the contrary state, and when it is dry the stomach is 
<A NAME="486"></A>moist and cold, so it often happens that the evaporations reciprocally 
<A NAME="487"></A>take one another's place and interchange.
<A NAME="488"></A><BR><BR>Further, after rain wind generally rises in those places where 
<A NAME="489"></A>the rain fell, and when rain has come on the wind ceases. These are necessary 
<A NAME="490"></A>effects of the principles we have explained. After rain the earth is being 
<A NAME="491"></A>dried by its own heat and that from above and gives off the evaporation 
<A NAME="492"></A>which we saw to be the material cause of. wind. Again, suppose this secretion 
<A NAME="493"></A>is present and wind prevails; the heat is continually being thrown off, 
<A NAME="494"></A>rising to the upper region, and so the wind ceases; then the fall in temperature 
<A NAME="495"></A>makes vapour form and condense into water. Water also forms and cools the 
<A NAME="496"></A>dry evaporation when the clouds are driven together and the cold concentrated 
<A NAME="497"></A>in them. These are the causes that make wind cease on the advent of rain, 
<A NAME="498"></A>and rain fall on the cessation of wind.
<A NAME="499"></A><BR><BR>The cause of the predominance of winds from the north and from 
<A NAME="500"></A>the south is the same. (Most winds, as a matter of fact, are north winds 
<A NAME="501"></A>or south winds.) These are the only regions which the sun does not visit: 
<A NAME="502"></A>it approaches them and recedes from them, but its course is always over 
<A NAME="503"></A>the-west and the east. Hence clouds collect on either side, and when the 
<A NAME="504"></A>sun approaches it provokes the moist evaporation, and when it recedes to 
<A NAME="505"></A>the opposite side there are storms and rain. So summer and winter are due 
<A NAME="506"></A>to the sun's motion to and from the solstices, and water ascends and falls 
<A NAME="507"></A>again for the same reason. Now since most rain falls in those regions towards 
<A NAME="508"></A>which and from which the sun turns and these are the north and the south, 
<A NAME="509"></A>and since most evaporation must take place where there is the greatest 
<A NAME="510"></A>rainfall, just as green wood gives most smoke, and since this evaporation 
<A NAME="511"></A>is wind, it is natural that the most and most important winds should come 
<A NAME="512"></A>from these quarters. (The winds from the north are called Boreae, those 
<A NAME="513"></A>from the south Noti.)
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR>The course of winds is oblique: for though the evaporation rises 
<A NAME="515"></A>straight up from the earth, they blow round it because all the surrounding 
<A NAME="516"></A>air follows the motion of the heavens. Hence the question might be asked 
<A NAME="517"></A>whether winds originate from above or from below. The motion comes from 
<A NAME="518"></A>above: before we feel the wind blowing the air betrays its presence if 
<A NAME="519"></A>there are clouds or a mist, for their motion shows that the wind has begun 
<A NAME="520"></A>to blow before it has actually reached us; and this implies that the source 
<A NAME="521"></A>of winds is above. But since wind is defined as 'a quantity of dry evaporation 
<A NAME="522"></A>from the earth moving round the earth', it is clear that while the origin 
<A NAME="523"></A>of the motion is from above, the matter and the generation of wind come 
<A NAME="524"></A>from below. The oblique movement of the rising evaporation is caused from 
<A NAME="525"></A>above: for the motion of the heavens determines the processes that are 
<A NAME="526"></A>at a distance from the earth, and the motion from below is vertical and 
<A NAME="527"></A>every cause is more active where it is nearest to the effect; but in its 
<A NAME="528"></A>generation and origin wind plainly derives from the 
<A NAME="529"></A>earth.
<A NAME="530"></A><BR><BR>The facts bear out the view that winds are formed by the gradual 
<A NAME="531"></A>union of many evaporations just as rivers derive their sources from the 
<A NAME="532"></A>water that oozes from the earth. Every wind is weakest in the spot from 
<A NAME="533"></A>which it blows; as they proceed and leave their source at a distance they 
<A NAME="534"></A>gather strength. Thus the winter in the north is windless and calm: that 
<A NAME="535"></A>is, in the north itself; but, the breeze that blows from there so gently 
<A NAME="536"></A>as to escape observation becomes a great wind as it passes 
<A NAME="537"></A>on.
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR>We have explained the nature and origin of wind, the occurrence 
<A NAME="539"></A>of drought and rains, the reason why rain stops wind and wind rises after 
<A NAME="540"></A>rain, the prevalence of north and south winds and also why wind moves in 
<A NAME="541"></A>the way it does.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="542"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="543"></A><BR><BR>The sun both checks the formation of winds and stimulates it. When 
<A NAME="544"></A>the evaporation is small in amount and faint the sun wastes it and dissipates 
<A NAME="545"></A>by its greater heat the lesser heat contained in the evaporation. It also 
<A NAME="546"></A>dries up the earth, the source of the evaporation, before the latter has 
<A NAME="547"></A>appeared in bulk: just as, when you throw a little fuel into a great fire, 
<A NAME="548"></A>it is often burnt up before giving off any smoke. In these ways the sun 
<A NAME="549"></A>checks winds and prevents them from rising at all: it checks them by wasting 
<A NAME="550"></A>the evaporation, and prevents their rising by drying up the earth quickly. 
<A NAME="551"></A>Hence calm is very apt to prevail about the rising of Orion and lasts until 
<A NAME="552"></A>the coming of the Etesiae and their 'forerunners'.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>Calm is due to two causes. Either cold quenches the evaporation, 
<A NAME="554"></A>for instance a sharp frost: or excessive heat wastes it. In the intermediate 
<A NAME="555"></A>periods, too, the causes are generally either that the evaporation has 
<A NAME="556"></A>not had time to develop or that it has passed away and there is none as 
<A NAME="557"></A>yet to replace it.
<A NAME="558"></A><BR><BR>Both the setting and the rising of Orion are considered to be treacherous 
<A NAME="559"></A>and stormy, because they place at a change of season (namely of summer 
<A NAME="560"></A>or winter; and because the size of the constellation makes its rise last 
<A NAME="561"></A>over many days) and a state of change is always indefinite and therefore 
<A NAME="562"></A>liable to disturbance.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>The Etesiae blow after the summer solstice and the rising of the 
<A NAME="564"></A>dog-star: not at the time when the sun is closest nor when it is distant; 
<A NAME="565"></A>and they blow by day and cease at night. The reason is that when the sun 
<A NAME="566"></A>is near it dries up the earth before evaporation has taken place, but when 
<A NAME="567"></A>it has receded a little its heat and the evaporation are present in the 
<A NAME="568"></A>right proportion; so the ice melts and the earth, dried by its own heat 
<A NAME="569"></A>and that of the sun, smokes and vapours. They abate at night because the 
<A NAME="570"></A>cold pf the nights checks the melting of the ice. What is frozen gives 
<A NAME="571"></A>off no evaporation, nor does that which contains no dryness at all: it 
<A NAME="572"></A>is only where something dry contains moisture that it gives off evaporation 
<A NAME="573"></A>under the influence of heat.
<A NAME="574"></A><BR><BR>The question is sometimes asked: why do the north winds which we 
<A NAME="575"></A>call the Etesiae blow continuously after the summer solstice, when there 
<A NAME="576"></A>are no corresponding south winds after the winter solstice? The facts are 
<A NAME="577"></A>reasonable enough: for the so-called 'white south winds' do blow at the 
<A NAME="578"></A>corresponding season, though they are not equally continuous and so escape 
<A NAME="579"></A>observation and give rise to this inquiry. The reason for this is that 
<A NAME="580"></A>the north wind I from the arctic regions which are full of water and snow. 
<A NAME="581"></A>The sun thaws them and so the Etesiae blow: after rather than at the summer 
<A NAME="582"></A>solstice. (For the greatest heat is developed not when the sun is nearest 
<A NAME="583"></A>to the north, but when its heat has been felt for a considerable period 
<A NAME="584"></A>and it has not yet receded far. The 'bird winds' blow in the same way after 
<A NAME="585"></A>the winter solstice. They, too, are weak Etesiae, but they blow less and 
<A NAME="586"></A>later than the Etesiae. They begin to blow only on the seventieth day because 
<A NAME="587"></A>the sun is distant and therefore weaker. They do not blow so continuously 
<A NAME="588"></A>because only things on the surface of the earth and offering little resistance 
<A NAME="589"></A>evaporate then, the thoroughly frozen parts requiring greater heat to melt 
<A NAME="590"></A>them. So they blow intermittently till the true Etesiae come on again at 
<A NAME="591"></A>the summer solstice: for from that time onwards the wind tends to blow 
<A NAME="592"></A>continuously.) But the south wind blows from the tropic of Cancer and not 
<A NAME="593"></A>from the antarctic region.
<A NAME="594"></A><BR><BR>There are two inhabitable sections of the earth: one near our upper, 
<A NAME="595"></A>or nothern pole, the other near the other or southern pole; and their shape 
<A NAME="596"></A>is like that of a tambourine. If you draw lines from the centre of the 
<A NAME="597"></A>earth they cut out a drum-shaped figure. The lines form two cones; the 
<A NAME="598"></A>base of the one is the tropic, of the other the ever visible circle, their 
<A NAME="599"></A>vertex is at the centre of the earth. Two other cones towards the south 
<A NAME="600"></A>pole give corresponding segments of the earth. These sections alone are 
<A NAME="601"></A>habitable. Beyond the tropics no one can live: for there the shade would 
<A NAME="602"></A>not fall to the north, whereas the earth is known to be uninhabitable before 
<A NAME="603"></A>the sun is in the zenith or the shade is thrown to the south: and the regions 
<A NAME="604"></A>below the Bear are uninhabitable because of the cold.
<A NAME="605"></A><BR><BR>(The Crown, too, moves over this region: for it is in the zenith 
<A NAME="606"></A>when it is on our meridian.)
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>So we see that the way in which they now describe the geography 
<A NAME="608"></A>of the earth is ridiculous. They depict the inhabited earth as round, but 
<A NAME="609"></A>both ascertained facts and general considerations show this to be impossible. 
<A NAME="610"></A>If we reflect we see that the inhabited region is limited in breadth, while 
<A NAME="611"></A>the climate admits of its extending all round the earth. For we meet with 
<A NAME="612"></A>no excessive heat or cold in the direction of its length but only in that 
<A NAME="613"></A>of its breadth; so that there is nothing to prevent our travelling round 
<A NAME="614"></A>the earth unless the extent of the sea presents an obstacle anywhere. The 
<A NAME="615"></A>records of journeys by sea and land bear this out. They make the length 
<A NAME="616"></A>far greater than the breadth. If we compute these voyages and journeys 
<A NAME="617"></A>the distance from the Pillars of Heracles to India exceeds that from Aethiopia 
<A NAME="618"></A>to Maeotis and the northernmost Scythians by a ratio of more than 5 to 
<A NAME="619"></A>3, as far as such matters admit of accurate statement. Yet we know the 
<A NAME="620"></A>whole breadth of the region we dwell in up to the uninhabited parts: in 
<A NAME="621"></A>one direction no one lives because of the cold, in the other because of 
<A NAME="622"></A>the heat.
<A NAME="623"></A><BR><BR>But it is the sea which divides as it seems the parts beyond India 
<A NAME="624"></A>from those beyond the Pillars of Heracles and prevents the earth from being 
<A NAME="625"></A>inhabited all round.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>Now since there must be a region bearing the same relation to the 
<A NAME="627"></A>southern pole as the place we live in bears to our pole, it will clearly 
<A NAME="628"></A>correspond in the ordering of its winds as well as in other things. So 
<A NAME="629"></A>just as we have a north wind here, they must have a corresponding wind 
<A NAME="630"></A>from the antarctic. This wind cannot reach us since our own north wind 
<A NAME="631"></A>is like a land breeze and does not even reach the limits of the region 
<A NAME="632"></A>we live in. The prevalence of north winds here is due to our lying near 
<A NAME="633"></A>the north. Yet even here they give out and fail to penetrate far: in the 
<A NAME="634"></A>southern sea beyond Libya east and west winds are always blowing alternately, 
<A NAME="635"></A>like north and south winds with us. So it is clear that the south wind 
<A NAME="636"></A>is not the wind that blows from the south pole. It is neither that nor 
<A NAME="637"></A>the wind from the winter tropic. For symmetry would require another wind 
<A NAME="638"></A>blowing from the summer tropic, which there is not, since we know that 
<A NAME="639"></A>only one wind blows from that quarter. So the south wind clearly blows 
<A NAME="640"></A>from the torrid region. Now the sun is so near to that region that it has 
<A NAME="641"></A>no water, or snow which might melt and cause Etesiae. But because that 
<A NAME="642"></A>place is far more extensive and open the south wind is greater and stronger 
<A NAME="643"></A>and warmer than the north and penetrates farther to the north than the 
<A NAME="644"></A>north wind does to the south.
<A NAME="645"></A><BR><BR>The origin of these winds and their relation to one another has 
<A NAME="646"></A>now been explained.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="647"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="648"></A><BR><BR>Let us now explain the position of the winds, their oppositions, 
<A NAME="649"></A>which can blow simultaneously with which, and which cannot, their names 
<A NAME="650"></A>and number, and any other of their affections that have not been treated 
<A NAME="651"></A>in the 'particular questions'. What we say about their position must be 
<A NAME="652"></A>followed with the help of the figure. For clearness' sake we have drawn 
<A NAME="653"></A>the circle of the horizon, which is round, but it represents the zone in 
<A NAME="654"></A>which we live; for that can be divided in the same way. Let us also begin 
<A NAME="655"></A>by laying down that those things are locally contrary which are locally 
<A NAME="656"></A>most distant from one another, just as things specifically most remote 
<A NAME="657"></A>from one another are specific contraries. Now things that face one another 
<A NAME="658"></A>from opposite ends of a diameter are locally most distant from one another. 
<A NAME="659"></A>(See diagram.)
<A NAME="660"></A><BR><BR>Let A be the point where the sun sets at the equinox and B, the 
<A NAME="661"></A>point opposite, the place where it rises at the equinox. Let there be another 
<A NAME="662"></A>diameter cutting this at right angles, and let the point H on it be the 
<A NAME="663"></A>north and its diametrical opposite O the south. Let Z be the rising of 
<A NAME="664"></A>the sun at the summer solstice and E its setting at the summer solstice; 
<A NAME="665"></A>D its rising at the winter solstice, and G its setting at the winter solstice. 
<A NAME="666"></A>Draw a diameter from Z to G from D to E. Then since those things are locally 
<A NAME="667"></A>contrary which are most distant from one another in space, and points diametrically 
<A NAME="668"></A>opposite are most distant from one another, those winds must necessarily 
<A NAME="669"></A>be contrary to one another that blow from opposite ends of a 
<A NAME="670"></A>diameter.
<A NAME="671"></A><BR><BR>The names of the winds according to their position are these. Zephyrus 
<A NAME="672"></A>is the wind that blows from A, this being the point where the sun sets 
<A NAME="673"></A>at the equinox. Its contrary is Apeliotes blowing from B the point where 
<A NAME="674"></A>the sun rises at the equinox. The wind blowing from H, the north, is the 
<A NAME="675"></A>true north wind, called Aparctias: while Notus blowing from O is its contrary; 
<A NAME="676"></A>for this point is the south and O is contrary to H, being diametrically 
<A NAME="677"></A>opposite to it. Caecias blows from Z, where the sun rises at the summer 
<A NAME="678"></A>solstice. Its contrary is not the wind blowing from E but Lips blowing 
<A NAME="679"></A>from G. For Lips blows from the point where the sun sets at the winter 
<A NAME="680"></A>solstice and is diametrically opposite to Caecias: so it is its contrary. 
<A NAME="681"></A>Eurus blows from D, coming from the point where the sun rises at the winter 
<A NAME="682"></A>solstice. It borders on Notus, and so we often find that people speak of 
<A NAME="683"></A>'Euro-Noti'. Its contrary is not Lips blowing from G but the wind that 
<A NAME="684"></A>blows from E which some call Argestes, some Olympias, and some Sciron. 
<A NAME="685"></A>This blows from the point where the sun sets at the summer solstice, and 
<A NAME="686"></A>is the only wind that is diametrically opposite to Eurus. These are the 
<A NAME="687"></A>winds that are diametrically opposite to one another and their 
<A NAME="688"></A>contraries.
<A NAME="689"></A><BR><BR>There are other winds which have no contraries. The wind they call 
<A NAME="690"></A>Thrascias, which lies between Argestes and Aparctias, blows from I; and 
<A NAME="691"></A>the wind called Meses, which lies between Caecias and Aparctias, from K. 
<A NAME="692"></A>(The line IK nearly coincides with the ever visible circle, but not quite.) 
<A NAME="693"></A>These winds have no contraries. Meses has not, or else there would be a 
<A NAME="694"></A>wind blowing from the point M which is diametrically opposite. Thrascias 
<A NAME="695"></A>corresponding to the point I has not, for then there would be a wind blowing 
<A NAME="696"></A>from N, the point which is diametrically opposite. (But perhaps a local 
<A NAME="697"></A>wind which the inhabitants of those parts call Phoenicias blows from that 
<A NAME="698"></A>point.)
<A NAME="699"></A><BR><BR>These are the most important and definite winds and these their 
<A NAME="700"></A>places.
<A NAME="701"></A><BR><BR>There are more winds from the north than from the south. The reason 
<A NAME="702"></A>for this is that the region in which we live lies nearer to the north. 
<A NAME="703"></A>Also, much more water and snow is pushed aside into this quarter because 
<A NAME="704"></A>the other lies under the sun and its course. When this thaws and soaks 
<A NAME="705"></A>into the earth and is exposed to the heat of the sun and the earth it necessarily 
<A NAME="706"></A>causes evaporation to rise in greater quantities and over a greater 
<A NAME="707"></A>space.
<A NAME="708"></A><BR><BR>Of the winds we have described Aparctias is the north wind in the 
<A NAME="709"></A>strict sense. Thrascias and Meses are north winds too. (Caecias is half 
<A NAME="710"></A>north and half east.) South are that which blows from due south and Lips. 
<A NAME="711"></A>East, the wind from the rising of the sun at the equinox and Eurus. Phoenicias 
<A NAME="712"></A>is half south and half east. West, the wind from the true west and that 
<A NAME="713"></A>called Argestes. More generally these winds are classified as northerly 
<A NAME="714"></A>or southerly. The west winds are counted as northerly, for they blow from 
<A NAME="715"></A>the place of sunset and are therefore colder; the east winds as southerly, 
<A NAME="716"></A>for they are warmer because they blow from the place of sunrise. So the 
<A NAME="717"></A>distinction of cold and hot or warm is the basis for the division of the 
<A NAME="718"></A>winds into northerly and southerly. East winds are warmer than west winds 
<A NAME="719"></A>because the sun shines on the east longer, whereas it leaves the west sooner 
<A NAME="720"></A>and reaches it later.
<A NAME="721"></A><BR><BR>Since this is the distribution of the winds it is clear that contrary 
<A NAME="722"></A>winds cannot blow simultaneously. They are diametrically opposite to one 
<A NAME="723"></A>another and one of the two must be overpowered and cease. Winds that are 
<A NAME="724"></A>not diametrically opposite to one another may blow simultaneously: for 
<A NAME="725"></A>instance the winds from Z and from D. Hence it sometimes happens that both 
<A NAME="726"></A>of them, though different winds and blowing from different quarters, are 
<A NAME="727"></A>favourable to sailors making for the same point.
<A NAME="728"></A><BR><BR>Contrary winds commonly blow at opposite seasons. Thus Caecias 
<A NAME="729"></A>and in general the winds north of the summer solstice blow about the time 
<A NAME="730"></A>of the spring equinox, but about the autumn equinox Lips; and Zephyrus 
<A NAME="731"></A>about the summer solstice, but about the winter solstice 
<A NAME="732"></A>Eurus.
<A NAME="733"></A><BR><BR>Aparctias, Thrascias, and Argestes are the winds that fall on others 
<A NAME="734"></A>most and stop them. Their source is so close to us that they are greater 
<A NAME="735"></A>and stronger than other winds. They bring fair weather most of all winds 
<A NAME="736"></A>for the same reason, for, blowing as they do, from close at hand, they 
<A NAME="737"></A>overpower the other winds and stop them; they also blow away the clouds 
<A NAME="738"></A>that are forming and leave a clear sky-unless they happen to be very cold. 
<A NAME="739"></A>Then they do not bring fair weather, but being colder than they are strong 
<A NAME="740"></A>they condense the clouds before driving them away.
<A NAME="741"></A><BR><BR>Caecias does not bring fair weather because it returns upon itself. 
<A NAME="742"></A>Hence the saying: 'Bringing it on himself as Caecias does 
<A NAME="743"></A>clouds.'
<A NAME="744"></A><BR><BR>When they cease, winds are succeeded by their neighbours in the 
<A NAME="745"></A>direction of the movement of the sun. For an effect is most apt to be produced 
<A NAME="746"></A>in the neighbourhood of its cause, and the cause of winds moves with the 
<A NAME="747"></A>sun.
<A NAME="748"></A><BR><BR>Contrary winds have either the same or contrary effects. Thus Lips 
<A NAME="749"></A>and Caecias, sometimes called Hellespontias, are both rainy gestes and 
<A NAME="750"></A>Eurus are dry: the latter being dry at first and rainy afterwards. Meses 
<A NAME="751"></A>and Aparctias are coldest and bring most snow. Aparctias, Thrascias, and 
<A NAME="752"></A>Argestes bring hail. Notus, Zephyrus, and Eurus are hot. Caecias covers 
<A NAME="753"></A>the sky with heavy clouds, Lips with lighter ones. Caecias does this because 
<A NAME="754"></A>it returns upon itself and combines the qualities of Boreas and Eurus. 
<A NAME="755"></A>By being cold it condenses and gathers the vaporous air, and because it 
<A NAME="756"></A>is easterly it carries with it and drives before it a great quantity of 
<A NAME="757"></A>such matter. Aparctias, Thrascias, and Argestes bring fair weather for 
<A NAME="758"></A>the reason we have explained before. These winds and Meses are most commonly 
<A NAME="759"></A>accompanied by lightning. They are cold because they blow from the north, 
<A NAME="760"></A>and lightning is due to cold, being ejected when the clouds contract. Some 
<A NAME="761"></A>of these same bring hail with them for the same reason; namely, that they 
<A NAME="762"></A>cause a sudden condensation.
<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>Hurricanes are commonest in autumn, and next in spring: Aparctias, 
<A NAME="764"></A>Thrascias, and Argestes give rise to them most. This is because hurricanes 
<A NAME="765"></A>are generally formed when some winds are blowing and others fall on them; 
<A NAME="766"></A>and these are the winds which are most apt to fall on others that are blowing; 
<A NAME="767"></A>the reason for which, too, we have explained before.
<A NAME="768"></A><BR><BR>The Etesiae veer round: they begin from the north, and become for 
<A NAME="769"></A>dwellers in the west Thrasciae, Argestae, and Zephyrus (for Zephyrus belongs 
<A NAME="770"></A>to the north). For dwellers in the east they veer round as far as 
<A NAME="771"></A>Apeliotes.
<A NAME="772"></A><BR><BR>So much for the winds, their origin and nature and the properties 
<A NAME="773"></A>common to them all or peculiar to each.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="774"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="775"></A><BR><BR>We must go on to discuss earthquakes next, for their cause is akin 
<A NAME="776"></A>to our last subject.
<A NAME="777"></A><BR><BR>The theories that have been put forward up to the present date 
<A NAME="778"></A>are three, and their authors three men, Anaxagoras of Clazomenae, and before 
<A NAME="779"></A>him Anaximenes of Miletus, and later Democritus of Abdera.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR><BR>Anaxagoras says that the ether, which naturally moves upwards, 
<A NAME="781"></A>is caught in hollows below the earth and so shakes it, for though the earth 
<A NAME="782"></A>is really all of it equally porous, its surface is clogged up by rain. 
<A NAME="783"></A>This implies that part of the whole sphere is 'above' and part 'below': 
<A NAME="784"></A>'above' being the part on which we live, 'below' the 
<A NAME="785"></A>other.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR><BR>This theory is perhaps too primitive to require refutation. It 
<A NAME="787"></A>is absurd to think of up and down otherwise than as meaning that heavy 
<A NAME="788"></A>bodies move to the earth from every quarter, and light ones, such as fire, 
<A NAME="789"></A>away from it; especially as we see that, as far as our knowledge of the 
<A NAME="790"></A>earth goes, the horizon always changes with a change in our position, which 
<A NAME="791"></A>proves that the earth is convex and spherical. It is absurd, too, to maintain 
<A NAME="792"></A>that the earth rests on the air because of its size, and then to say that 
<A NAME="793"></A>impact upwards from below shakes it right through. Besides he gives no 
<A NAME="794"></A>account of the circumstances attendant on earthquakes: for not every country 
<A NAME="795"></A>or every season is subject to them.
<A NAME="796"></A><BR><BR>Democritus says that the earth is full of water and that when a 
<A NAME="797"></A>quantity of rain-water is added to this an earthquake is the result. The 
<A NAME="798"></A>hollows in the earth being unable to admit the excess of water it forces 
<A NAME="799"></A>its way in and so causes an earthquake. Or again, the earth as it dries 
<A NAME="800"></A>draws the water from the fuller to the emptier parts, and the inrush of 
<A NAME="801"></A>the water as it changes its place causes the earthquake.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>Anaximenes says that the earth breaks up when it grows wet or dry, 
<A NAME="803"></A>and earthquakes are due to the fall of these masses as they break away. 
<A NAME="804"></A>Hence earthquakes take place in times of drought and again of heavy rain, 
<A NAME="805"></A>since, as we have explained, the earth grows dry in time of drought and 
<A NAME="806"></A>breaks up, whereas the rain makes it sodden and destroys its 
<A NAME="807"></A>cohesion.
<A NAME="808"></A><BR><BR>But if this were the case the earth ought to be found to be sinking 
<A NAME="809"></A>in many places. Again, why do earthquakes frequently occur in places which 
<A NAME="810"></A>are not excessively subject to drought or rain, as they ought to be on 
<A NAME="811"></A>the theory? Besides, on this view, earthquakes ought always to be getting 
<A NAME="812"></A>fewer, and should come to an end entirely some day: the notion of contraction 
<A NAME="813"></A>by packing together implies this. So this is impossible the theory must 
<A NAME="814"></A>be impossible too.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="815"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="816"></A><BR><BR>We have already shown that wet and dry must both give rise to an 
<A NAME="817"></A>evaporation: earthquakes are a necessary consequence of this fact. The 
<A NAME="818"></A>earth is essentially dry, but rain fills it with moisture. Then the sun 
<A NAME="819"></A>and its own fire warm it and give rise to a quantity of wind both outside 
<A NAME="820"></A>and inside it. This wind sometimes flows outwards in a single body, sometimes 
<A NAME="821"></A>inwards, and sometimes it is divided. All these are necessary laws. Next 
<A NAME="822"></A>we must find out what body has the greatest motive force. This will certainly 
<A NAME="823"></A>be the body that naturally moves farthest and is most violent. Now that 
<A NAME="824"></A>which has the most rapid motion is necessarily the most violent; for its 
<A NAME="825"></A>swiftness gives its impact the greatest force. Again, the rarest body, 
<A NAME="826"></A>that which can most readily pass through every other body, is that which 
<A NAME="827"></A>naturally moves farthest. Wind satisfies these conditions in the highest 
<A NAME="828"></A>degree (fire only becomes flame and moves rapidly when wind accompanies 
<A NAME="829"></A>it): so that not water nor earth is the cause of earthquakes but wind-that 
<A NAME="830"></A>is, the inrush of the external evaporation into the 
<A NAME="831"></A>earth.
<A NAME="832"></A><BR><BR>Hence, since the evaporation generally follows in a continuous 
<A NAME="833"></A>body in the direction in which it first started, and either all of it flows 
<A NAME="834"></A>inwards or all outwards, most earthquakes and the greatest are accompanied 
<A NAME="835"></A>by calm. It is true that some take place when a wind is blowing, but this 
<A NAME="836"></A>presents no difficulty. We sometimes find several winds blowing simultaneously. 
<A NAME="837"></A>If one of these enters the earth we get an earthquake attended by wind. 
<A NAME="838"></A>Only these earthquakes are less severe because their source and cause is 
<A NAME="839"></A>divided.
<A NAME="840"></A><BR><BR>Again, most earthquakes and the severest occur at night or, if 
<A NAME="841"></A>by day, about noon, that being generally the calmest part of the day. For 
<A NAME="842"></A>when the sun exerts its full power (as it does about noon) it shuts the 
<A NAME="843"></A>evaporation into the earth. Night, too, is calmer than day. The absence 
<A NAME="844"></A>of the sun makes the evaporation return into the earth like a sort of ebb 
<A NAME="845"></A>tide, corresponding to the outward flow; especially towards dawn, for the 
<A NAME="846"></A>winds, as a rule, begin to blow then, and if their source changes about 
<A NAME="847"></A>like the Euripus and flows inwards the quantity of wind in the earth is 
<A NAME="848"></A>greater and a more violent earthquake results.
<A NAME="849"></A><BR><BR>The severest earthquakes take place where the sea is full of currents 
<A NAME="850"></A>or the earth spongy and cavernous: so they occur near the Hellespont and 
<A NAME="851"></A>in Achaea and Sicily, and those parts of Euboea which correspond to our 
<A NAME="852"></A>description-where the sea is supposed to flow in channels below the earth. 
<A NAME="853"></A>The hot springs, too, near Aedepsus are due to a cause of this kind. It 
<A NAME="854"></A>is the confined character of these places that makes them so liable to 
<A NAME="855"></A>earthquakes. A great and therefore violent wind is developed, which would 
<A NAME="856"></A>naturally blow away from the earth: but the onrush of the sea in a great 
<A NAME="857"></A>mass thrusts it back into the earth. The countries that are spongy below 
<A NAME="858"></A>the surface are exposed to earthquakes because they have room for so much 
<A NAME="859"></A>wind.
<A NAME="860"></A><BR><BR>For the same reason earthquakes usually take place in spring and 
<A NAME="861"></A>autumn and in times of wet and of drought-because these are the windiest 
<A NAME="862"></A>seasons. Summer with its heat and winter with its frost cause calm: winter 
<A NAME="863"></A>is too cold, summer too dry for winds to form. In time of drought the air 
<A NAME="864"></A>is full of wind; drought is just the predominance of the dry over the moist 
<A NAME="865"></A>evaporation. Again, excessive rain causes more of the evaporation to form 
<A NAME="866"></A>in the earth. Then this secretion is shut up in a narrow compass and forced 
<A NAME="867"></A>into a smaller space by the water that fills the cavities. Thus a great 
<A NAME="868"></A>wind is compressed into a smaller space and so gets the upper hand, and 
<A NAME="869"></A>then breaks out and beats against the earth and shakes it 
<A NAME="870"></A>violently.
<A NAME="871"></A><BR><BR>We must suppose the action of the wind in the earth to be analogous 
<A NAME="872"></A>to the tremors and throbbings caused in us by the force of the wind contained 
<A NAME="873"></A>in our bodies. Thus some earthquakes are a sort of tremor, others a sort 
<A NAME="874"></A>of throbbing. Again, we must think of an earthquake as something like the 
<A NAME="875"></A>tremor that often runs through the body after passing water as the wind 
<A NAME="876"></A>returns inwards from without in one volume.
<A NAME="877"></A><BR><BR>The force wind can have may be gathered not only from what happens 
<A NAME="878"></A>in the air (where one might suppose that it owed its power to produce such 
<A NAME="879"></A>effects to its volume), but also from what is observed in animal bodies. 
<A NAME="880"></A>Tetanus and spasms are motions of wind, and their force is such that the 
<A NAME="881"></A>united efforts of many men do not succeed in overcoming the movements of 
<A NAME="882"></A>the patients. We must suppose, then (to compare great things with small), 
<A NAME="883"></A>that what happens in the earth is just like that. Our theory has been verified 
<A NAME="884"></A>by actual observation in many places. It has been known to happen that 
<A NAME="885"></A>an earthquake has continued until the wind that caused it burst through 
<A NAME="886"></A>the earth into the air and appeared visibly like a hurricane. This happened 
<A NAME="887"></A>lately near Heracleia in Pontus and some time past at the island Hiera, 
<A NAME="888"></A>one of the group called the Aeolian islands. Here a portion of the earth 
<A NAME="889"></A>swelled up and a lump like a mound rose with a noise: finally it burst, 
<A NAME="890"></A>and a great wind came out of it and threw up live cinders and ashes which 
<A NAME="891"></A>buried the neighbouring town of Lipara and reached some of the towns in 
<A NAME="892"></A>Italy. The spot where this eruption occurred is still to be 
<A NAME="893"></A>seen.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR><BR>Indeed, this must be recognized as the cause of the fire that is 
<A NAME="895"></A>generated in the earth: the air is first broken up in small particles and 
<A NAME="896"></A>then the wind is beaten about and so catches fire.
<A NAME="897"></A><BR><BR>A phenomenon in these islands affords further evidence of the fact 
<A NAME="898"></A>that winds move below the surface of the earth. When a south wind is going 
<A NAME="899"></A>to blow there is a premonitory indication: a sound is heard in the places 
<A NAME="900"></A>from which the eruptions issue. This is because the sea is being pushed 
<A NAME="901"></A>on from a distance and its advance thrusts back into the earth the wind 
<A NAME="902"></A>that was issuing from it. The reason why there is a noise and no earthquake 
<A NAME="903"></A>is that the underground spaces are so extensive in proportion to the quantity 
<A NAME="904"></A>of the air that is being driven on that the wind slips away into the void 
<A NAME="905"></A>beyond.
<A NAME="906"></A><BR><BR>Again, our theory is supported by the facts that the sun appears 
<A NAME="907"></A>hazy and is darkened in the absence of clouds, and that there is sometimes 
<A NAME="908"></A>calm and sharp frost before earthquakes at sunrise. The sun is necessarily 
<A NAME="909"></A>obscured and darkened when the evaporation which dissolves and rarefies 
<A NAME="910"></A>the air begins to withdraw into the earth. The calm, too, and the cold 
<A NAME="911"></A>towards sunrise and dawn follow from the theory. The calm we have already 
<A NAME="912"></A>explained. There must as a rule be calm because the wind flows back into 
<A NAME="913"></A>the earth: again, it must be most marked before the more violent earthquakes, 
<A NAME="914"></A>for when the wind is not part outside earth, part inside, but moves in 
<A NAME="915"></A>a single body, its strength must be greater. The cold comes because the 
<A NAME="916"></A>evaporation which is naturally and essentially hot enters the earth. (Wind 
<A NAME="917"></A>is not recognized to be hot, because it sets the air in motion, and that 
<A NAME="918"></A>is full of a quantity of cold vapour. It is the same with the breath we 
<A NAME="919"></A>blow from our mouth: close by it is warm, as it is when we breathe out 
<A NAME="920"></A>through the mouth, but there is so little of it that it is scarcely noticed, 
<A NAME="921"></A>whereas at a distance it is cold for the same reason as wind.) Well, when 
<A NAME="922"></A>this evaporation disappears into the earth the vaporous exhalation concentrates 
<A NAME="923"></A>and causes cold in any place in which this disappearance 
<A NAME="924"></A>occurs.
<A NAME="925"></A><BR><BR>A sign which sometimes precedes earthquakes can be explained in 
<A NAME="926"></A>the same way. Either by day or a little after sunset, in fine weather, 
<A NAME="927"></A>a little, light, long-drawn cloud is seen, like a long very straight line. 
<A NAME="928"></A>This is because the wind is leaving the air and dying down. Something analogous 
<A NAME="929"></A>to this happens on the sea-shore. When the sea breaks in great waves the 
<A NAME="930"></A>marks left on the sand are very thick and crooked, but when the sea is 
<A NAME="931"></A>calm they are slight and straight (because the secretion is small). As 
<A NAME="932"></A>the sea is to the shore so the wind is to the cloudy air; so, when the 
<A NAME="933"></A>wind drops, this very straight and thin cloud is left, a sort of wave-mark 
<A NAME="934"></A>in the air.
<A NAME="935"></A><BR><BR>An earthquake sometimes coincides with an eclipse of the moon for 
<A NAME="936"></A>the same reason. When the earth is on the point of being interposed, but 
<A NAME="937"></A>the light and heat of the sun has not quite vanished from the air but is 
<A NAME="938"></A>dying away, the wind which causes the earthquake before the eclipse, turns 
<A NAME="939"></A>off into the earth, and calm ensues. For there often are winds before eclipses: 
<A NAME="940"></A>at nightfall if the eclipse is at midnight, and at midnight if the eclipse 
<A NAME="941"></A>is at dawn. They are caused by the lessening of the warmth from the moon 
<A NAME="942"></A>when its sphere approaches the point at which the eclipse is going to take 
<A NAME="943"></A>place. So the influence which restrained and quieted the air weakens and 
<A NAME="944"></A>the air moves again and a wind rises, and does so later, the later the 
<A NAME="945"></A>eclipse.
<A NAME="946"></A><BR><BR>A severe earthquake does not stop at once or after a single shock, 
<A NAME="947"></A>but first the shocks go on, often for about forty days; after that, for 
<A NAME="948"></A>one or even two years it gives premonitory indications in the same place. 
<A NAME="949"></A>The severity of the earthquake is determined by the quantity of wind and 
<A NAME="950"></A>the shape of the passages through which it flows. Where it is beaten back 
<A NAME="951"></A>and cannot easily find its way out the shocks are most violent, and there 
<A NAME="952"></A>it must remain in a cramped space like water that cannot escape. Any throbbing 
<A NAME="953"></A>in the body does not cease suddenly or quickly, but by degrees according 
<A NAME="954"></A>as the affection passes off. So here the agency which created the evaporation 
<A NAME="955"></A>and gave it an impulse to motion clearly does not at once exhaust the whole 
<A NAME="956"></A>of the material from which it forms the wind which we call an earthquake. 
<A NAME="957"></A>So until the rest of this is exhausted the shocks must continue, though 
<A NAME="958"></A>more gently, and they must go on until there is too little of the evaporation 
<A NAME="959"></A>left to have any perceptible effect on the earth at 
<A NAME="960"></A>all.
<A NAME="961"></A><BR><BR>Subterranean noises, too, are due to the wind; sometimes they portend 
<A NAME="962"></A>earthquakes but sometimes they have been heard without any earthquake following. 
<A NAME="963"></A>Just as the air gives off various sounds when it is struck, so it does 
<A NAME="964"></A>when it strikes other things; for striking involves being struck and so 
<A NAME="965"></A>the two cases are the same. The sound precedes the shock because sound 
<A NAME="966"></A>is thinner and passes through things more readily than wind. But when the 
<A NAME="967"></A>wind is too weak by reason of thinness to cause an earthquake the absence 
<A NAME="968"></A>of a shock is due to its filtering through readily, though by striking 
<A NAME="969"></A>hard and hollow masses of different shapes it makes various noises, so 
<A NAME="970"></A>that the earth sometimes seems to 'bellow' as the portentmongers 
<A NAME="971"></A>say.
<A NAME="972"></A><BR><BR>Water has been known to burst out during an earthquake. But that 
<A NAME="973"></A>does not make water the cause of the earthquake. The wind is the efficient 
<A NAME="974"></A>cause whether it drives the water along the surface or up from below: just 
<A NAME="975"></A>as winds are the causes of waves and not waves of winds. Else we might 
<A NAME="976"></A>as well say that earth was the cause; for it is upset in an earthquake, 
<A NAME="977"></A>just like water (for effusion is a form of upsetting). No, earth and water 
<A NAME="978"></A>are material causes (being patients, not agents): the true cause is the 
<A NAME="979"></A>wind.
<A NAME="980"></A><BR><BR>The combination of a tidal wave with an earthquake is due to the 
<A NAME="981"></A>presence of contrary winds. It occurs when the wind which is shaking the 
<A NAME="982"></A>earth does not entirely succeed in driving off the sea which another wind 
<A NAME="983"></A>is bringing on, but pushes it back and heaps it up in a great mass in one 
<A NAME="984"></A>place. Given this situation it follows that when this wind gives way the 
<A NAME="985"></A>whole body of the sea, driven on by the other wind, will burst out and 
<A NAME="986"></A>overwhelm the land. This is what happened in Achaea. There a south wind 
<A NAME="987"></A>was blowing, but outside a north wind; then there was a calm and the wind 
<A NAME="988"></A>entered the earth, and then the tidal wave came on and simultaneously there 
<A NAME="989"></A>was an earthquake. This was the more violent as the sea allowed no exit 
<A NAME="990"></A>to the wind that had entered the earth, but shut it in. So in their struggle 
<A NAME="991"></A>with one another the wind caused the earthquake, and the wave by its settling 
<A NAME="992"></A>down the inundation.
<A NAME="993"></A><BR><BR>Earthquakes are local and often affect a small district only; whereas 
<A NAME="994"></A>winds are not local. Such phenomena are local when the evaporations at 
<A NAME="995"></A>a given place are joined by those from the next and unite; this, as we 
<A NAME="996"></A>explained, is what happens when there is drought or excessive rain locally. 
<A NAME="997"></A>Now earthquakes do come about in this way but winds do not. For earthquakes, 
<A NAME="998"></A>rains, and droughts have their source and origin inside the earth, so that 
<A NAME="999"></A>the sun is not equally able to direct all the evaporations in one direction. 
<A NAME="1000"></A>But on the evaporations in the air the sun has more influence so that, 
<A NAME="1001"></A>when once they have been given an impulse by its motion, which is determined 
<A NAME="1002"></A>by its various positions, they flow in one direction.
<A NAME="1003"></A><BR><BR>When the wind is present in sufficient quantity there is an earthquake. 
<A NAME="1004"></A>The shocks are horizontal like a tremor; except occasionally, in a few 
<A NAME="1005"></A>places, where they act vertically, upwards from below, like a throbbing. 
<A NAME="1006"></A>It is the vertical direction which makes this kind of earthquake so rare. 
<A NAME="1007"></A>The motive force does not easily accumulate in great quantity in the position 
<A NAME="1008"></A>required, since the surface of the earth secretes far more of the evaporation 
<A NAME="1009"></A>than its depths. Wherever an earthquake of this kind does occur a quantity 
<A NAME="1010"></A>of stones comes to the surface of the earth (as when you throw up things 
<A NAME="1011"></A>in a winnowing fan), as we see from Sipylus and the Phlegraean plain and 
<A NAME="1012"></A>the district in Liguria, which were devastated by this kind of 
<A NAME="1013"></A>earthquake.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>Islands in the middle of the sea are less exposed to earthquakes 
<A NAME="1015"></A>than those near land. First, the volume of the sea cools the evaporations 
<A NAME="1016"></A>and overpowers them by its weight and so crushes them. Then, currents and 
<A NAME="1017"></A>not shocks are produced in the sea by the action of the winds. Again, it 
<A NAME="1018"></A>is so extensive that evaporations do not collect in it but issue from it, 
<A NAME="1019"></A>and these draw the evaporations from the earth after them. Islands near 
<A NAME="1020"></A>the continent really form part of it: the intervening sea is not enough 
<A NAME="1021"></A>to make any difference; but those in the open sea can only be shaken if 
<A NAME="1022"></A>the whole of the sea that surrounds them is shaken too.
<A NAME="1023"></A><BR><BR>We have now explained earthquakes, their nature and cause, and 
<A NAME="1024"></A>the most important of the circumstances attendant on their 
<A NAME="1025"></A>appearance.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1026"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="1027"></A><BR><BR>Let us go on to explain lightning and thunder, and further whirlwind, 
<A NAME="1028"></A>fire-wind, and thunderbolts: for the cause of them all is the 
<A NAME="1029"></A>same.
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR><BR>As we have said, there are two kinds of exhalation, moist and dry, 
<A NAME="1031"></A>and the atmosphere contains them both potentially. It, as we have said 
<A NAME="1032"></A>before, condenses into cloud, and the density of the clouds is highest 
<A NAME="1033"></A>at their upper limit. (For they must be denser and colder on the side where 
<A NAME="1034"></A>the heat escapes to the upper region and leaves them. This explains why 
<A NAME="1035"></A>hurricanes and thunderbolts and all analogous phenomena move downwards 
<A NAME="1036"></A>in spite of the fact that everything hot has a natural tendency upwards. 
<A NAME="1037"></A>Just as the pips that we squeeze between our fingers are heavy but often 
<A NAME="1038"></A>jump upwards: so these things are necessarily squeezed out away from the 
<A NAME="1039"></A>densest part of the cloud.) Now the heat that escapes disperses to the 
<A NAME="1040"></A>up region. But if any of the dry exhalation is caught in the process as 
<A NAME="1041"></A>the air cools, it is squeezed out as the clouds contract, and collides 
<A NAME="1042"></A>in its rapid course with the neighbouring clouds, and the sound of this 
<A NAME="1043"></A>collision is what we call thunder. This collision is analogous, to compare 
<A NAME="1044"></A>small with great, to the sound we hear in a flame which men call the laughter 
<A NAME="1045"></A>or the threat of Hephaestus or of Hestia. This occurs when the wood dries 
<A NAME="1046"></A>and cracks and the exhalation rushes on the flame in a body. So in the 
<A NAME="1047"></A>clouds, the exhalation is projected and its impact on dense clouds causes 
<A NAME="1048"></A>thunder: the variety of the sound is due to the irregularity of the clouds 
<A NAME="1049"></A>and the hollows that intervene where their density is interrupted. This 
<A NAME="1050"></A>then, is thunder, and this its cause.
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR><BR>It usually happens that the exhalation that is ejected is inflamed 
<A NAME="1052"></A>and burns with a thin and faint fire: this is what we call lightning, where 
<A NAME="1053"></A>we see as it were the exhalation coloured in the act of its ejection. It 
<A NAME="1054"></A>comes into existence after the collision and the thunder, though we see 
<A NAME="1055"></A>it earlier because sight is quicker than hearing. The rowing of triremes 
<A NAME="1056"></A>illustrates this: the oars are going back again before the sound of their 
<A NAME="1057"></A>striking the water reaches us.
<A NAME="1058"></A><BR><BR>However, there are some who maintain that there is actually fire 
<A NAME="1059"></A>in the clouds. Empedocles says that it consists of some of the sun's rays 
<A NAME="1060"></A>which are intercepted: Anaxagoras that it is part of the upper ether (which 
<A NAME="1061"></A>he calls fire) which has descended from above. Lightning, then, is the 
<A NAME="1062"></A>gleam of this fire, and thunder the hissing noise of its extinction in 
<A NAME="1063"></A>the cloud.
<A NAME="1064"></A><BR><BR>But this involves the view that lightning actually is prior to 
<A NAME="1065"></A>thunder and does not merely appear to be so. Again, this intercepting of 
<A NAME="1066"></A>the fire is impossible on either theory, but especially it is said to be 
<A NAME="1067"></A>drawn down from the upper ether. Some reason ought to be given why that 
<A NAME="1068"></A>which naturally ascends should descend, and why it should not always do 
<A NAME="1069"></A>so, but only when it is cloudy. When the sky is clear there is no lightning: 
<A NAME="1070"></A>to say that there is, is altogether wanton.
<A NAME="1071"></A><BR><BR>The view that the heat of the sun's rays intercepted in the clouds 
<A NAME="1072"></A>is the cause of these phenomena is equally unattractive: this, too, is 
<A NAME="1073"></A>a most careless explanation. Thunder, lightning, and the rest must have 
<A NAME="1074"></A>a separate and determinate cause assigned to them on which they ensue. 
<A NAME="1075"></A>But this theory does nothing of the sort. It is like supposing that water, 
<A NAME="1076"></A>snow, and hail existed all along and were produced when the time came and 
<A NAME="1077"></A>not generated at all, as if the atmosphere brought each to hand out of 
<A NAME="1078"></A>its stock from time to time. They are concretions in the same way as thunder 
<A NAME="1079"></A>and lightning are discretions, so that if it is true of either that they 
<A NAME="1080"></A>are not generated but pre-exist, the same must be true of the other. Again, 
<A NAME="1081"></A>how can any distinction be made about the intercepting between this case 
<A NAME="1082"></A>and that of interception in denser substances such as water? Water, too, 
<A NAME="1083"></A>is heated by the sun and by fire: yet when it contracts again and grows 
<A NAME="1084"></A>cold and freezes no such ejection as they describe occurs, though it ought 
<A NAME="1085"></A>on their the. to take place on a proportionate scale. Boiling is due to 
<A NAME="1086"></A>the exhalation generated by fire: but it is impossible for it to exist 
<A NAME="1087"></A>in the water beforehand; and besides they call the noise 'hissing', not 
<A NAME="1088"></A>'boiling'. But hissing is really boiling on a small scale: for when that 
<A NAME="1089"></A>which is brought into contact with moisture and is in process of being 
<A NAME="1090"></A>extinguished gets the better of it, then it boils and makes the noise in 
<A NAME="1091"></A>question. Some-Cleidemus is one of them-say that lightning is nothing objective 
<A NAME="1092"></A>but merely an appearance. They compare it to what happens when you strike 
<A NAME="1093"></A>the sea with a rod by night and the water is seen to shine. They say that 
<A NAME="1094"></A>the moisture in the cloud is beaten about in the same way, and that lightning 
<A NAME="1095"></A>is the appearance of brightness that ensues.
<A NAME="1096"></A><BR><BR>This theory is due to ignorance of the theory of reflection, which 
<A NAME="1097"></A>is the real cause of that phenomenon. The water appears to shine when struck 
<A NAME="1098"></A>because our sight is reflected from it to some bright object: hence the 
<A NAME="1099"></A>phenomenon occurs mainly by night: the appearance is not seen by day because 
<A NAME="1100"></A>the daylight is too in, tense and obscures it.
<A NAME="1101"></A><BR><BR>These are the theories of others about thunder and lightning: some 
<A NAME="1102"></A>maintaining that lightning is a reflection, the others that lightning is 
<A NAME="1103"></A>fire shining through the cloud and thunder its extinction, the fire not 
<A NAME="1104"></A>being generated in each case but existing beforehand. We say that the same 
<A NAME="1105"></A>stuff is wind on the earth, and earthquake under it, and in the clouds 
<A NAME="1106"></A>thunder. The essential constituent of all these phenomena is the same: 
<A NAME="1107"></A>namely, the dry exhalation. If it flows in one direction it is wind, in 
<A NAME="1108"></A>another it causes earthquakes; in the clouds, when they are in a process 
<A NAME="1109"></A>of change and contract and condense into water, it is ejected and causes 
<A NAME="1110"></A
