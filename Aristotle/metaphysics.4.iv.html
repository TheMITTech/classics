<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>"THERE is a science which investigates being as being and the attributes 
<A NAME="13"></A>which belong to this in virtue of its own nature. Now this is not the same 
<A NAME="14"></A>as any of the so-called special sciences; for none of these others treats 
<A NAME="15"></A>universally of being as being. They cut off a part of being and investigate 
<A NAME="16"></A>the attribute of this part; this is what the mathematical sciences for 
<A NAME="17"></A>instance do. Now since we are seeking the first principles and the highest 
<A NAME="18"></A>causes, clearly there must be some thing to which these belong in virtue 
<A NAME="19"></A>of its own nature. If then those who sought the elements of existing things 
<A NAME="20"></A>were seeking these same principles, it is necessary that the elements must 
<A NAME="21"></A>be elements of being not by accident but just because it is being. Therefore 
<A NAME="22"></A>it is of being as being that we also must grasp the first causes. 
<A NAME="23"></A>"<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
<A NAME="24"></A><B>Part 2</B>
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>"There are many senses in which a thing may be said to 'be', but 
<A NAME="26"></A>all that 'is' is related to one central point, one definite kind of thing, 
<A NAME="27"></A>and is not said to 'be' by a mere ambiguity. Everything which is healthy 
<A NAME="28"></A>is related to health, one thing in the sense that it preserves health, 
<A NAME="29"></A>another in the sense that it produces it, another in the sense that it 
<A NAME="30"></A>is a symptom of health, another because it is capable of it. And that which 
<A NAME="31"></A>is medical is relative to the medical art, one thing being called medical 
<A NAME="32"></A>because it possesses it, another because it is naturally adapted to it, 
<A NAME="33"></A>another because it is a function of the medical art. And we shall find 
<A NAME="34"></A>other words used similarly to these. So, too, there are many senses in 
<A NAME="35"></A>which a thing is said to be, but all refer to one starting-point; some 
<A NAME="36"></A>things are said to be because they are substances, others because they 
<A NAME="37"></A>are affections of substance, others because they are a process towards 
<A NAME="38"></A>substance, or destructions or privations or qualities of substance, or 
<A NAME="39"></A>productive or generative of substance, or of things which are relative 
<A NAME="40"></A>to substance, or negations of one of these thing of substance itself. It 
<A NAME="41"></A>is for this reason that we say even of non-being that it is nonbeing. As, 
<A NAME="42"></A>then, there is one science which deals with all healthy things, the same 
<A NAME="43"></A>applies in the other cases also. For not only in the case of things which 
<A NAME="44"></A>have one common notion does the investigation belong to one science, but 
<A NAME="45"></A>also in the case of things which are related to one common nature; for 
<A NAME="46"></A>even these in a sense have one common notion. It is clear then that it 
<A NAME="47"></A>is the work of one science also to study the things that are, qua being.-But 
<A NAME="48"></A>everywhere science deals chiefly with that which is primary, and on which 
<A NAME="49"></A>the other things depend, and in virtue of which they get their names. If, 
<A NAME="50"></A>then, this is substance, it will be of substances that the philosopher 
<A NAME="51"></A>must grasp the principles and the causes. <BR><BR>"Now for each one class 
<A NAME="52"></A>of things, as there is one perception, so there is one science, as for 
<A NAME="53"></A>instance grammar, being one science, investigates all articulate sounds. 
<A NAME="54"></A>Hence to investigate all the species of being qua being is the work of 
<A NAME="55"></A>a science which is generically one, and to investigate the several species 
<A NAME="56"></A>is the work of the specific parts of the science. <BR><BR>"If, now, being 
<A NAME="57"></A>and unity are the same and are one thing in the sense that they are implied 
<A NAME="58"></A>in one another as principle and cause are, not in the sense that they are 
<A NAME="59"></A>explained by the same definition (though it makes no difference even if 
<A NAME="60"></A>we suppose them to be like that-in fact this would even strengthen our 
<A NAME="61"></A>case); for 'one man' and 'man' are the same thing, and so are 'existent 
<A NAME="62"></A>man' and 'man', and the doubling of the words in 'one man and one existent 
<A NAME="63"></A>man' does not express anything different (it is clear that the two things 
<A NAME="64"></A>are not separated either in coming to be or in ceasing to be); and similarly 
<A NAME="65"></A>'one existent man' adds nothing to 'existent man', and that it is obvious 
<A NAME="66"></A>that the addition in these cases means the same thing, and unity is nothing 
<A NAME="67"></A>apart from being; and if, further, the substance of each thing is one in 
<A NAME="68"></A>no merely accidental way, and similarly is from its very nature something 
<A NAME="69"></A>that is:-all this being so, there must be exactly as many species of being 
<A NAME="70"></A>as of unity. And to investigate the essence of these is the work of a science 
<A NAME="71"></A>which is generically one-I mean, for instance, the discussion of the same 
<A NAME="72"></A>and the similar and the other concepts of this sort; and nearly all contraries 
<A NAME="73"></A>may be referred to this origin; let us take them as having been investigated 
<A NAME="74"></A>in the 'Selection of Contraries'. <BR><BR>"And there are as many parts 
<A NAME="75"></A>of philosophy as there are kinds of substance, so that there must necessarily 
<A NAME="76"></A>be among them a first philosophy and one which follows this. For being 
<A NAME="77"></A>falls immediately into genera; for which reason the sciences too will correspond 
<A NAME="78"></A>to these genera. For the philosopher is like the mathematician, as that 
<A NAME="79"></A>word is used; for mathematics also has parts, and there is a first and 
<A NAME="80"></A>a second science and other successive ones within the sphere of mathematics. 
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>"Now since it is the work of one science to investigate opposites, 
<A NAME="82"></A>and plurality is opposed to unity-and it belongs to one science to investigate 
<A NAME="83"></A>the negation and the privation because in both cases we are really investigating 
<A NAME="84"></A>the one thing of which the negation or the privation is a negation or privation 
<A NAME="85"></A>(for we either say simply that that thing is not present, or that it is 
<A NAME="86"></A>not present in some particular class; in the latter case difference is 
<A NAME="87"></A>present over and above what is implied in negation; for negation means 
<A NAME="88"></A>just the absence of the thing in question, while in privation there is 
<A NAME="89"></A>also employed an underlying nature of which the privation is asserted):-in 
<A NAME="90"></A>view of all these facts, the contraries of the concepts we named above, 
<A NAME="91"></A>the other and the dissimilar and the unequal, and everything else which 
<A NAME="92"></A>is derived either from these or from plurality and unity, must fall within 
<A NAME="93"></A>the province of the science above named. And contrariety is one of these 
<A NAME="94"></A>concepts; for contrariety is a kind of difference, and difference is a 
<A NAME="95"></A>kind of otherness. Therefore, since there are many senses in which a thing 
<A NAME="96"></A>is said to be one, these terms also will have many senses, but yet it belongs 
<A NAME="97"></A>to one science to know them all; for a term belongs to different sciences 
<A NAME="98"></A>not if it has different senses, but if it has not one meaning and its definitions 
<A NAME="99"></A>cannot be referred to one central meaning. And since all things are referred 
<A NAME="100"></A>to that which is primary, as for instance all things which are called one 
<A NAME="101"></A>are referred to the primary one, we must say that this holds good also 
<A NAME="102"></A>of the same and the other and of contraries in general; so that after distinguishing 
<A NAME="103"></A>the various senses of each, we must then explain by reference to what is 
<A NAME="104"></A>primary in the case of each of the predicates in question, saying how they 
<A NAME="105"></A>are related to it; for some will be called what they are called because 
<A NAME="106"></A>they possess it, others because they produce it, and others in other such 
<A NAME="107"></A>ways. <BR><BR>"It is evident, then, that it belongs to one science to be 
<A NAME="108"></A>able to give an account of these concepts as well as of substance (this 
<A NAME="109"></A>was one of the questions in our book of problems), and that it is the function 
<A NAME="110"></A>of the philosopher to be able to investigate all things. For if it is not 
<A NAME="111"></A>the function of the philosopher, who is it who will inquire whether Socrates 
<A NAME="112"></A>and Socrates seated are the same thing, or whether one thing has one contrary, 
<A NAME="113"></A>or what contrariety is, or how many meanings it has? And similarly with 
<A NAME="114"></A>all other such questions. Since, then, these are essential modifications 
<A NAME="115"></A>of unity qua unity and of being qua being, not qua numbers or lines or 
<A NAME="116"></A>fire, it is clear that it belongs to this science to investigate both the 
<A NAME="117"></A>essence of these concepts and their properties. And those who study these 
<A NAME="118"></A>properties err not by leaving the sphere of philosophy, but by forgetting 
<A NAME="119"></A>that substance, of which they have no correct idea, is prior to these other 
<A NAME="120"></A>things. For number qua number has peculiar attributes, such as oddness 
<A NAME="121"></A>and evenness, commensurability and equality, excess and defect, and these 
<A NAME="122"></A>belong to numbers either in themselves or in relation to one another. And 
<A NAME="123"></A>similarly the solid and the motionless and that which is in motion and 
<A NAME="124"></A>the weightless and that which has weight have other peculiar properties. 
<A NAME="125"></A>So too there are certain properties peculiar to being as such, and it is 
<A NAME="126"></A>about these that the philosopher has to investigate the truth.-An indication 
<A NAME="127"></A>of this may be mentioned: dialecticians and sophists assume the same guise 
<A NAME="128"></A>as the philosopher, for sophistic is Wisdom which exists only in semblance, 
<A NAME="129"></A>and dialecticians embrace all things in their dialectic, and being is common 
<A NAME="130"></A>to all things; but evidently their dialectic embraces these subjects because 
<A NAME="131"></A>these are proper to philosophy.-For sophistic and dialectic turn on the 
<A NAME="132"></A>same class of things as philosophy, but this differs from dialectic in 
<A NAME="133"></A>the nature of the faculty required and from sophistic in respect of the 
<A NAME="134"></A>purpose of the philosophic life. Dialectic is merely critical where philosophy 
<A NAME="135"></A>claims to know, and sophistic is what appears to be philosophy but is not. 
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>"Again, in the list of contraries one of the two columns is privative, 
<A NAME="137"></A>and all contraries are reducible to being and non-being, and to unity and 
<A NAME="138"></A>plurality, as for instance rest belongs to unity and movement to plurality. 
<A NAME="139"></A>And nearly all thinkers agree that being and substance are composed of 
<A NAME="140"></A>contraries; at least all name contraries as their first principles-some 
<A NAME="141"></A>name odd and even, some hot and cold, some limit and the unlimited, some 
<A NAME="142"></A>love and strife. And all the others as well are evidently reducible to 
<A NAME="143"></A>unity and plurality (this reduction we must take for granted), and the 
<A NAME="144"></A>principles stated by other thinkers fall entirely under these as their 
<A NAME="145"></A>genera. It is obvious then from these considerations too that it belongs 
<A NAME="146"></A>to one science to examine being qua being. For all things are either contraries 
<A NAME="147"></A>or composed of contraries, and unity and plurality are the starting-points 
<A NAME="148"></A>of all contraries. And these belong to one science, whether they have or 
<A NAME="149"></A>have not one single meaning. Probably the truth is that they have not; 
<A NAME="150"></A>yet even if 'one' has several meanings, the other meanings will be related 
<A NAME="151"></A>to the primary meaning (and similarly in the case of the contraries), even 
<A NAME="152"></A>if being or unity is not a universal and the same in every instance or 
<A NAME="153"></A>is not separable from the particular instances (as in fact it probably 
<A NAME="154"></A>is not; the unity is in some cases that of common reference, in some cases 
<A NAME="155"></A>that of serial succession). And for this reason it does not belong to the 
<A NAME="156"></A>geometer to inquire what is contrariety or completeness or unity or being 
<A NAME="157"></A>or the same or the other, but only to presuppose these concepts and reason 
<A NAME="158"></A>from this starting-point.--Obviously then it is the work of one science 
<A NAME="159"></A>to examine being qua being, and the attributes which belong to it qua being, 
<A NAME="160"></A>and the same science will examine not only substances but also their attributes, 
<A NAME="161"></A>both those above named and the concepts 'prior' and 'posterior', 'genus' 
<A NAME="162"></A>and 'species', 'whole' and 'part', and the others of this 
<A NAME="163"></A>sort.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="164"></A><B>Part 3</B>
<A NAME="165"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="166"></A><BR><BR>"We must state whether it belongs to one or to different sciences 
<A NAME="167"></A>to inquire into the truths which are in mathematics called axioms, and 
<A NAME="168"></A>into substance. Evidently, the inquiry into these also belongs to one science, 
<A NAME="169"></A>and that the science of the philosopher; for these truths hold good for 
<A NAME="170"></A>everything that is, and not for some special genus apart from others. And 
<A NAME="171"></A>all men use them, because they are true of being qua being and each genus 
<A NAME="172"></A>has being. But men use them just so far as to satisfy their purposes; that 
<A NAME="173"></A>is, as far as the genus to which their demonstrations refer extends. Therefore 
<A NAME="174"></A>since these truths clearly hold good for all things qua being (for this 
<A NAME="175"></A>is what is common to them), to him who studies being qua being belongs 
<A NAME="176"></A>the inquiry into these as well. And for this reason no one who is conducting 
<A NAME="177"></A>a special inquiry tries to say anything about their truth or falsity,-neither 
<A NAME="178"></A>the geometer nor the arithmetician. Some natural philosophers indeed have 
<A NAME="179"></A>done so, and their procedure was intelligible enough; for they thought 
<A NAME="180"></A>that they alone were inquiring about the whole of nature and about being. 
<A NAME="181"></A>But since there is one kind of thinker who is above even the natural philosopher 
<A NAME="182"></A>(for nature is only one particular genus of being), the discussion of these 
<A NAME="183"></A>truths also will belong to him whose inquiry is universal and deals with 
<A NAME="184"></A>primary substance. Physics also is a kind of Wisdom, but it is not the 
<A NAME="185"></A>first kind.-And the attempts of some of those who discuss the terms on 
<A NAME="186"></A>which truth should be accepted, are due to a want of training in logic; 
<A NAME="187"></A>for they should know these things already when they come to a special study, 
<A NAME="188"></A>and not be inquiring into them while they are listening to lectures on 
<A NAME="189"></A>it. <BR><BR>"Evidently then it belongs to the philosopher, i.e. to him 
<A NAME="190"></A>who is studying the nature of all substance, to inquire also into the principles 
<A NAME="191"></A>of syllogism. But he who knows best about each genus must be able to state 
<A NAME="192"></A>the most certain principles of his subject, so that he whose subject is 
<A NAME="193"></A>existing things qua existing must be able to state the most certain principles 
<A NAME="194"></A>of all things. This is the philosopher, and the most certain principle 
<A NAME="195"></A>of all is that regarding which it is impossible to be mistaken; for such 
<A NAME="196"></A>a principle must be both the best known (for all men may be mistaken about 
<A NAME="197"></A>things which they do not know), and non-hypothetical. For a principle which 
<A NAME="198"></A>every one must have who understands anything that is, is not a hypothesis; 
<A NAME="199"></A>and that which every one must know who knows anything, he must already 
<A NAME="200"></A>have when he comes to a special study. Evidently then such a principle 
<A NAME="201"></A>is the most certain of all; which principle this is, let us proceed to 
<A NAME="202"></A>say. It is, that the same attribute cannot at the same time belong and 
<A NAME="203"></A>not belong to the same subject and in the same respect; we must presuppose, 
<A NAME="204"></A>to guard against dialectical objections, any further qualifications which 
<A NAME="205"></A>might be added. This, then, is the most certain of all principles, since 
<A NAME="206"></A>it answers to the definition given above. For it is impossible for any 
<A NAME="207"></A>one to believe the same thing to be and not to be, as some think Heraclitus 
<A NAME="208"></A>says. For what a man says, he does not necessarily believe; and if it is 
<A NAME="209"></A>impossible that contrary attributes should belong at the same time to the 
<A NAME="210"></A>same subject (the usual qualifications must be presupposed in this premiss 
<A NAME="211"></A>too), and if an opinion which contradicts another is contrary to it, obviously 
<A NAME="212"></A>it is impossible for the same man at the same time to believe the same 
<A NAME="213"></A>thing to be and not to be; for if a man were mistaken on this point he 
<A NAME="214"></A>would have contrary opinions at the same time. It is for this reason that 
<A NAME="215"></A>all who are carrying out a demonstration reduce it to this as an ultimate 
<A NAME="216"></A>belief; for this is naturally the starting-point even for all the other 
<A NAME="217"></A>axioms.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="218"></A><B>Part 4</B>
<A NAME="219"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>"There are some who, as we said, both themselves assert that it 
<A NAME="221"></A>is possible for the same thing to be and not to be, and say that people 
<A NAME="222"></A>can judge this to be the case. And among others many writers about nature 
<A NAME="223"></A>use this language. But we have now posited that it is impossible for anything 
<A NAME="224"></A>at the same time to be and not to be, and by this means have shown that 
<A NAME="225"></A>this is the most indisputable of all principles.-Some indeed demand that 
<A NAME="226"></A>even this shall be demonstrated, but this they do through want of education, 
<A NAME="227"></A>for not to know of what things one should demand demonstration, and of 
<A NAME="228"></A>what one should not, argues want of education. For it is impossible that 
<A NAME="229"></A>there should be demonstration of absolutely everything (there would be 
<A NAME="230"></A>an infinite regress, so that there would still be no demonstration); but 
<A NAME="231"></A>if there are things of which one should not demand demonstration, these 
<A NAME="232"></A>persons could not say what principle they maintain to be more self-evident 
<A NAME="233"></A>than the present one. <BR><BR>"We can, however, demonstrate negatively 
<A NAME="234"></A>even that this view is impossible, if our opponent will only say something; 
<A NAME="235"></A>and if he says nothing, it is absurd to seek to give an account of our 
<A NAME="236"></A>views to one who cannot give an account of anything, in so far as he cannot 
<A NAME="237"></A>do so. For such a man, as such, is from the start no better than a vegetable. 
<A NAME="238"></A>Now negative demonstration I distinguish from demonstration proper, because 
<A NAME="239"></A>in a demonstration one might be thought to be begging the question, but 
<A NAME="240"></A>if another person is responsible for the assumption we shall have negative 
<A NAME="241"></A>proof, not demonstration. The starting-point for all such arguments is 
<A NAME="242"></A>not the demand that our opponent shall say that something either is or 
<A NAME="243"></A>is not (for this one might perhaps take to be a begging of the question), 
<A NAME="244"></A>but that he shall say something which is significant both for himself and 
<A NAME="245"></A>for another; for this is necessary, if he really is to say anything. For, 
<A NAME="246"></A>if he means nothing, such a man will not be capable of reasoning, either 
<A NAME="247"></A>with himself or with another. But if any one grants this, demonstration 
<A NAME="248"></A>will be possible; for we shall already have something definite. The person 
<A NAME="249"></A>responsible for the proof, however, is not he who demonstrates but he who 
<A NAME="250"></A>listens; for while disowning reason he listens to reason. And again he 
<A NAME="251"></A>who admits this has admitted that something is true apart from demonstration 
<A NAME="252"></A>(so that not everything will be 'so and not so'). <BR><BR>"First then this 
<A NAME="253"></A>at least is obviously true, that the word 'be' or 'not be' has a definite 
<A NAME="254"></A>meaning, so that not everything will be 'so and not so'. Again, if 'man' 
<A NAME="255"></A>has one meaning, let this be 'two-footed animal'; by having one meaning 
<A NAME="256"></A>I understand this:-if 'man' means 'X', then if A is a man 'X' will be what 
<A NAME="257"></A>'being a man' means for him. (It makes no difference even if one were to 
<A NAME="258"></A>say a word has several meanings, if only they are limited in number; for 
<A NAME="259"></A>to each definition there might be assigned a different word. For instance, 
<A NAME="260"></A>we might say that 'man' has not one meaning but several, one of which would 
<A NAME="261"></A>have one definition, viz. 'two-footed animal', while there might be also 
<A NAME="262"></A>several other definitions if only they were limited in number; for a peculiar 
<A NAME="263"></A>name might be assigned to each of the definitions. If, however, they were 
<A NAME="264"></A>not limited but one were to say that the word has an infinite number of 
<A NAME="265"></A>meanings, obviously reasoning would be impossible; for not to have one 
<A NAME="266"></A>meaning is to have no meaning, and if words have no meaning our reasoning 
<A NAME="267"></A>with one another, and indeed with ourselves, has been annihilated; for 
<A NAME="268"></A>it is impossible to think of anything if we do not think of one thing; 
<A NAME="269"></A>but if this is possible, one name might be assigned to this thing.) <BR><BR>"Let 
<A NAME="270"></A>it be assumed then, as was said at the beginning, that the name has a meaning 
<A NAME="271"></A>and has one meaning; it is impossible, then, that 'being a man' should 
<A NAME="272"></A>mean precisely 'not being a man', if 'man' not only signifies something 
<A NAME="273"></A>about one subject but also has one significance (for we do not identify 
<A NAME="274"></A>'having one significance' with 'signifying something about one subject', 
<A NAME="275"></A>since on that assumption even 'musical' and 'white' and 'man' would have 
<A NAME="276"></A>had one significance, so that all things would have been one; for they 
<A NAME="277"></A>would all have had the same significance). <BR><BR>"And it will not be 
<A NAME="278"></A>possible to be and not to be the same thing, except in virtue of an ambiguity, 
<A NAME="279"></A>just as if one whom we call 'man', others were to call 'not-man'; but the 
<A NAME="280"></A>point in question is not this, whether the same thing can at the same time 
<A NAME="281"></A>be and not be a man in name, but whether it can in fact. Now if 'man' and 
<A NAME="282"></A>'not-man' mean nothing different, obviously 'not being a man' will mean 
<A NAME="283"></A>nothing different from 'being a man'; so that 'being a man' will be 'not 
<A NAME="284"></A>being a man'; for they will be one. For being one means this-being related 
<A NAME="285"></A>as 'raiment' and 'dress' are, if their definition is one. And if 'being 
<A NAME="286"></A>a man' and 'being a not-man' are to be one, they must mean one thing. But 
<A NAME="287"></A>it was shown earlier' that they mean different things.-Therefore, if it 
<A NAME="288"></A>is true to say of anything that it is a man, it must be a two-footed animal 
<A NAME="289"></A>(for this was what 'man' meant); and if this is necessary, it is impossible 
<A NAME="290"></A>that the same thing should not at that time be a two-footed animal; for 
<A NAME="291"></A>this is what 'being necessary' means-that it is impossible for the thing 
<A NAME="292"></A>not to be. It is, then, impossible that it should be at the same time true 
<A NAME="293"></A>to say the same thing is a man and is not a man. <BR><BR>"The same account 
<A NAME="294"></A>holds good with regard to 'not being a man', for 'being a man' and 'being 
<A NAME="295"></A>a not-man' mean different things, since even 'being white' and 'being a 
<A NAME="296"></A>man' are different; for the former terms are much more different so that 
<A NAME="297"></A>they must a fortiori mean different things. And if any one says that 'white' 
<A NAME="298"></A>means one and the same thing as 'man', again we shall say the same as what 
<A NAME="299"></A>was said before, that it would follow that all things are one, and not 
<A NAME="300"></A>only opposites. But if this is impossible, then what we have maintained 
<A NAME="301"></A>will follow, if our opponent will only answer our question. <BR><BR>"And 
<A NAME="302"></A>if, when one asks the question simply, he adds the contradictories, he 
<A NAME="303"></A>is not answering the question. For there is nothing to prevent the same 
<A NAME="304"></A>thing from being both a man and white and countless other things: but still, 
<A NAME="305"></A>if one asks whether it is or is not true to say that this is a man, our 
<A NAME="306"></A>opponent must give an answer which means one thing, and not add that 'it 
<A NAME="307"></A>is also white and large'. For, besides other reasons, it is impossible 
<A NAME="308"></A>to enumerate its accidental attributes, which are infinite in number; let 
<A NAME="309"></A>him, then, enumerate either all or none. Similarly, therefore, even if 
<A NAME="310"></A>the same thing is a thousand times a man and a not-man, he must not, in 
<A NAME="311"></A>answering the question whether this is a man, add that it is also at the 
<A NAME="312"></A>same time a not-man, unless he is bound to add also all the other accidents, 
<A NAME="313"></A>all that the subject is or is not; and if he does this, he is not observing 
<A NAME="314"></A>the rules of argument. <BR><BR>"And in general those who say this do away 
<A NAME="315"></A>with substance and essence. For they must say that all attributes are accidents, 
<A NAME="316"></A>and that there is no such thing as 'being essentially a man' or 'an animal'. 
<A NAME="317"></A>For if there is to be any such thing as 'being essentially a man' this 
<A NAME="318"></A>will not be 'being a not-man' or 'not being a man' (yet these are negations 
<A NAME="319"></A>of it); for there was one thing which it meant, and this was the substance 
<A NAME="320"></A>of something. And denoting the substance of a thing means that the essence 
<A NAME="321"></A>of the thing is nothing else. But if its being essentially a man is to 
<A NAME="322"></A>be the same as either being essentially a not-man or essentially not being 
<A NAME="323"></A>a man, then its essence will be something else. Therefore our opponents 
<A NAME="324"></A>must say that there cannot be such a definition of anything, but that all 
<A NAME="325"></A>attributes are accidental; for this is the distinction between substance 
<A NAME="326"></A>and accident-'white' is accidental to man, because though he is white, 
<A NAME="327"></A>whiteness is not his essence. But if all statements are accidental, there 
<A NAME="328"></A>will be nothing primary about which they are made, if the accidental always 
<A NAME="329"></A>implies predication about a subject. The predication, then, must go on 
<A NAME="330"></A>ad infinitum. But this is impossible; for not even more than two terms 
<A NAME="331"></A>can be combined in accidental predication. For (1) an accident is not an 
<A NAME="332"></A>accident of an accident, unless it be because both are accidents of the 
<A NAME="333"></A>same subject. I mean, for instance, that the white is musical and the latter 
<A NAME="334"></A>is white, only because both are accidental to man. But (2) Socrates is 
<A NAME="335"></A>musical, not in this sense, that both terms are accidental to something 
<A NAME="336"></A>else. Since then some predicates are accidental in this and some in that 
<A NAME="337"></A>sense, (a) those which are accidental in the latter sense, in which white 
<A NAME="338"></A>is accidental to Socrates, cannot form an infinite series in the upward 
<A NAME="339"></A>direction; e.g. Socrates the white has not yet another accident; for no 
<A NAME="340"></A>unity can be got out of such a sum. Nor again (b) will 'white' have another 
<A NAME="341"></A>term accidental to it, e.g. 'musical'. For this is no more accidental to 
<A NAME="342"></A>that than that is to this; and at the same time we have drawn the distinction, 
<A NAME="343"></A>that while some predicates are accidental in this sense, others are so 
<A NAME="344"></A>in the sense in which 'musical' is accidental to Socrates; and the accident 
<A NAME="345"></A>is an accident of an accident not in cases of the latter kind, but only 
<A NAME="346"></A>in cases of the other kind, so that not all terms will be accidental. There 
<A NAME="347"></A>must, then, even so be something which denotes substance. And if this is 
<A NAME="348"></A>so, it has been shown that contradictories cannot be predicated at the 
<A NAME="349"></A>same time. <BR><BR>"Again, if all contradictory statements are true of 
<A NAME="350"></A>the same subject at the same time, evidently all things will be one. For 
<A NAME="351"></A>the same thing will be a trireme, a wall, and a man, if of everything it 
<A NAME="352"></A>is possible either to affirm or to deny anything (and this premiss must 
<A NAME="353"></A>be accepted by those who share the views of Protagoras). For if any one 
<A NAME="354"></A>thinks that the man is not a trireme, evidently he is not a trireme; so 
<A NAME="355"></A>that he also is a trireme, if, as they say, contradictory statements are 
<A NAME="356"></A>both true. And we thus get the doctrine of Anaxagoras, that all things 
<A NAME="357"></A>are mixed together; so that nothing really exists. They seem, then, to 
<A NAME="358"></A>be speaking of the indeterminate, and, while fancying themselves to be 
<A NAME="359"></A>speaking of being, they are speaking about non-being; for it is that which 
<A NAME="360"></A>exists potentially and not in complete reality that is indeterminate. But 
<A NAME="361"></A>they must predicate of every subject the affirmation or the negation of 
<A NAME="362"></A>every attribute. For it is absurd if of each subject its own negation is 
<A NAME="363"></A>to be predicable, while the negation of something else which cannot be 
<A NAME="364"></A>predicated of it is not to be predicable of it; for instance, if it is 
<A NAME="365"></A>true to say of a man that he is not a man, evidently it is also true to 
<A NAME="366"></A>say that he is either a trireme or not a trireme. If, then, the affirmative 
<A NAME="367"></A>can be predicated, the negative must be predicable too; and if the affirmative 
<A NAME="368"></A>is not predicable, the negative, at least, will be more predicable than 
<A NAME="369"></A>the negative of the subject itself. If, then, even the latter negative 
<A NAME="370"></A>is predicable, the negative of 'trireme' will be also predicable; and, 
<A NAME="371"></A>if this is predicable, the affirmative will be so too. <BR><BR>"Those, 
<A NAME="372"></A>then, who maintain this view are driven to this conclusion, and to the 
<A NAME="373"></A>further conclusion that it is not necessary either to assert or to deny. 
<A NAME="374"></A>For if it is true that a thing is a man and a not-man, evidently also it 
<A NAME="375"></A>will be neither a man nor a not-man. For to the two assertions there answer 
<A NAME="376"></A>two negations, and if the former is treated as a single proposition compounded 
<A NAME="377"></A>out of two, the latter also is a single proposition opposite to the former. 
<A NAME="378"></A><BR><BR>"Again, either the theory is true in all cases, and a thing is 
<A NAME="379"></A>both white and not-white, and existent and non-existent, and all other 
<A NAME="380"></A>assertions and negations are similarly compatible or the theory is true 
<A NAME="381"></A>of some statements and not of others. And if not of all, the exceptions 
<A NAME="382"></A>will be contradictories of which admittedly only one is true; but if of 
<A NAME="383"></A>all, again either the negation will be true wherever the assertion is, 
<A NAME="384"></A>and the assertion true wherever the negation is, or the negation will be 
<A NAME="385"></A>true where the assertion is, but the assertion not always true where the 
<A NAME="386"></A>negation is. And (a) in the latter case there will be something which fixedly 
<A NAME="387"></A>is not, and this will be an indisputable belief; and if non-being is something 
<A NAME="388"></A>indisputable and knowable, the opposite assertion will be more knowable. 
<A NAME="389"></A>But (b) if it is equally possible also to assert all that it is possible 
<A NAME="390"></A>to deny, one must either be saying what is true when one separates the 
<A NAME="391"></A>predicates (and says, for instance, that a thing is white, and again that 
<A NAME="392"></A>it is not-white), or not. And if (i) it is not true to apply the predicates 
<A NAME="393"></A>separately, our opponent is not saying what he professes to say, and also 
<A NAME="394"></A>nothing at all exists; but how could non-existent things speak or walk, 
<A NAME="395"></A>as he does? Also all things would on this view be one, as has been already 
<A NAME="396"></A>said, and man and God and trireme and their contradictories will be the 
<A NAME="397"></A>same. For if contradictories can be predicated alike of each subject, one 
<A NAME="398"></A>thing will in no wise differ from another; for if it differ, this difference 
<A NAME="399"></A>will be something true and peculiar to it. And (ii) if one may with truth 
<A NAME="400"></A>apply the predicates separately, the above-mentioned result follows none 
<A NAME="401"></A>the less, and, further, it follows that all would then be right and all 
<A NAME="402"></A>would be in error, and our opponent himself confesses himself to be in 
<A NAME="403"></A>error.-And at the same time our discussion with him is evidently about 
<A NAME="404"></A>nothing at all; for he says nothing. For he says neither 'yes' nor 'no', 
<A NAME="405"></A>but 'yes and no'; and again he denies both of these and says 'neither yes 
<A NAME="406"></A>nor no'; for otherwise there would already be something definite. <BR><BR>"Again 
<A NAME="407"></A>if when the assertion is true, the negation is false, and when this is 
<A NAME="408"></A>true, the affirmation is false, it will not be possible to assert and deny 
<A NAME="409"></A>the same thing truly at the same time. But perhaps they might say this 
<A NAME="410"></A>was the very question at issue. <BR><BR>"Again, is he in error who judges 
<A NAME="411"></A>either that the thing is so or that it is not so, and is he right who judges 
<A NAME="412"></A>both? If he is right, what can they mean by saying that the nature of existing 
<A NAME="413"></A>things is of this kind? And if he is not right, but more right than he 
<A NAME="414"></A>who judges in the other way, being will already be of a definite nature, 
<A NAME="415"></A>and this will be true, and not at the same time also not true. But if all 
<A NAME="416"></A>are alike both wrong and right, one who is in this condition will not be 
<A NAME="417"></A>able either to speak or to say anything intelligible; for he says at the 
<A NAME="418"></A>same time both 'yes' and 'no.' And if he makes no judgement but 'thinks' 
<A NAME="419"></A>and 'does not think', indifferently, what difference will there be between 
<A NAME="420"></A>him and a vegetable?-Thus, then, it is in the highest degree evident that 
<A NAME="421"></A>neither any one of those who maintain this view nor any one else is really 
<A NAME="422"></A>in this position. For why does a man walk to Megara and not stay at home, 
<A NAME="423"></A>when he thinks he ought to be walking there? Why does he not walk early 
<A NAME="424"></A>some morning into a well or over a precipice, if one happens to be in his 
<A NAME="425"></A>way? Why do we observe him guarding against this, evidently because he 
<A NAME="426"></A>does not think that falling in is alike good and not good? Evidently, then, 
<A NAME="427"></A>he judges one thing to be better and another worse. And if this is so, 
<A NAME="428"></A>he must also judge one thing to be a man and another to be not-a-man, one 
<A NAME="429"></A>thing to be sweet and another to be not-sweet. For he does not aim at and 
<A NAME="430"></A>judge all things alike, when, thinking it desirable to drink water or to 
<A NAME="431"></A>see a man, he proceeds to aim at these things; yet he ought, if the same 
<A NAME="432"></A>thing were alike a man and not-a-man. But, as was said, there is no one 
<A NAME="433"></A>who does not obviously avoid some things and not others. Therefore, as 
<A NAME="434"></A>it seems, all men make unqualified judgements, if not about all things, 
<A NAME="435"></A>still about what is better and worse. And if this is not knowledge but 
<A NAME="436"></A>opinion, they should be all the more anxious about the truth, as a sick 
<A NAME="437"></A>man should be more anxious about his health than one who is healthy; for 
<A NAME="438"></A>he who has opinions is, in comparison with the man who knows, not in a 
<A NAME="439"></A>healthy state as far as the truth is concerned. <BR><BR>"Again, however 
<A NAME="440"></A>much all things may be 'so and not so', still there is a more and a less 
<A NAME="441"></A>in the nature of things; for we should not say that two and three are equally 
<A NAME="442"></A>even, nor is he who thinks four things are five equally wrong with him 
<A NAME="443"></A>who thinks they are a thousand. If then they are not equally wrong, obviously 
<A NAME="444"></A>one is less wrong and therefore more right. If then that which has more 
<A NAME="445"></A>of any quality is nearer the norm, there must be some truth to which the 
<A NAME="446"></A>more true is nearer. And even if there is not, still there is already something 
<A NAME="447"></A>better founded and liker the truth, and we shall have got rid of the unqualified 
<A NAME="448"></A>doctrine which would prevent us from determining anything in our 
<A NAME="449"></A>thought.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="450"></A><B>Part 5</B>
<A NAME="451"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>"From the same opinion proceeds the doctrine of Protagoras, and 
<A NAME="453"></A>both doctrines must be alike true or alike untrue. For on the one hand, 
<A NAME="454"></A>if all opinions and appearances are true, all statements must be at the 
<A NAME="455"></A>same time true and false. For many men hold beliefs in which they conflict 
<A NAME="456"></A>with one another, and think those mistaken who have not the same opinions 
<A NAME="457"></A>as themselves; so that the same thing must both be and not be. And on the 
<A NAME="458"></A>other hand, if this is so, all opinions must be true; for those who are 
<A NAME="459"></A>mistaken and those who are right are opposed to one another in their opinions; 
<A NAME="460"></A>if, then, reality is such as the view in question supposes, all will be 
<A NAME="461"></A>right in their beliefs. <BR><BR>"Evidently, then, both doctrines proceed 
<A NAME="462"></A>from the same way of thinking. But the same method of discussion must not 
<A NAME="463"></A>be used with all opponents; for some need persuasion, and others compulsion. 
<A NAME="464"></A>Those who have been driven to this position by difficulties in their thinking 
<A NAME="465"></A>can easily be cured of their ignorance; for it is not their expressed argument 
<A NAME="466"></A>but their thought that one has to meet. But those who argue for the sake 
<A NAME="467"></A>of argument can be cured only by refuting the argument as expressed in 
<A NAME="468"></A>speech and in words. <BR><BR>"Those who really feel the difficulties have 
<A NAME="469"></A>been led to this opinion by observation of the sensible world. (1) They 
<A NAME="470"></A>think that contradictories or contraries are true at the same time, because 
<A NAME="471"></A>they see contraries coming into existence out of the same thing. If, then, 
<A NAME="472"></A>that which is not cannot come to be, the thing must have existed before 
<A NAME="473"></A>as both contraries alike, as Anaxagoras says all is mixed in all, and Democritus 
<A NAME="474"></A>too; for he says the void and the full exist alike in every part, and yet 
<A NAME="475"></A>one of these is being, and the other non-being. To those, then, whose belief 
<A NAME="476"></A>rests on these grounds, we shall say that in a sense they speak rightly 
<A NAME="477"></A>and in a sense they err. For 'that which is' has two meanings, so that 
<A NAME="478"></A>in some sense a thing can come to be out of that which is not, while in 
<A NAME="479"></A>some sense it cannot, and the same thing can at the same time be in being 
<A NAME="480"></A>and not in being-but not in the same respect. For the same thing can be 
<A NAME="481"></A>potentially at the same time two contraries, but it cannot actually. And 
<A NAME="482"></A>again we shall ask them to believe that among existing things there is 
<A NAME="483"></A>also another kind of substance to which neither movement nor destruction 
<A NAME="484"></A>nor generation at all belongs. <BR><BR>"And (2) similarly some have inferred 
<A NAME="485"></A>from observation of the sensible world the truth of appearances. For they 
<A NAME="486"></A>think that the truth should not be determined by the large or small number 
<A NAME="487"></A>of those who hold a belief, and that the same thing is thought sweet by 
<A NAME="488"></A>some when they taste it, and bitter by others, so that if all were ill 
<A NAME="489"></A>or all were mad, and only two or three were well or sane, these would be 
<A NAME="490"></A>thought ill and mad, and not the others. <BR><BR>"And again, they say that 
<A NAME="491"></A>many of the other animals receive impressions contrary to ours; and that 
<A NAME="492"></A>even to the senses of each individual, things do not always seem the same. 
<A NAME="493"></A>Which, then, of these impressions are true and which are false is not obvious; 
<A NAME="494"></A>for the one set is no more true than the other, but both are alike. And 
<A NAME="495"></A>this is why Democritus, at any rate, says that either there is no truth 
<A NAME="496"></A>or to us at least it is not evident. <BR><BR>"And in general it is because 
<A NAME="497"></A>these thinkers suppose knowledge to be sensation, and this to be a physical 
<A NAME="498"></A>alteration, that they say that what appears to our senses must be true; 
<A NAME="499"></A>for it is for these reasons that both Empedocles and Democritus and, one 
<A NAME="500"></A>may almost say, all the others have fallen victims to opinions of this 
<A NAME="501"></A>sort. For Empedocles says that when men change their condition they change 
<A NAME="502"></A>their knowledge; "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="503"></A><BR><BR>"For wisdom increases in men according to what is before them. 
<A NAME="504"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="505"></A><BR><BR>"And elsewhere he says that:- "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>"So far as their nature changed, so far to them always <BR><BR>"Came 
<A NAME="507"></A>changed thoughts into mind. "<BR><BR>
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>"And Parmenides also expresses himself in the same way: 
<A NAME="509"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="510"></A><BR><BR>"For as at each time the much-bent limbs are composed, <BR><BR>"So 
<A NAME="511"></A>is the mind of men; for in each and all men <BR><BR>"'Tis one thing thinks-the 
<A NAME="512"></A>substance of their limbs: <BR><BR>"For that of which there is more is thought. 
<A NAME="513"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR>"A saying of Anaxagoras to some of his friends is also related,-that 
<A NAME="515"></A>things would be for them such as they supposed them to be. And they say 
<A NAME="516"></A>that Homer also evidently had this opinion, because he made Hector, when 
<A NAME="517"></A>he was unconscious from the blow, lie 'thinking other thoughts',-which 
<A NAME="518"></A>implies that even those who are bereft of thought have thoughts, though 
<A NAME="519"></A>not the same thoughts. Evidently, then, if both are forms of knowledge, 
<A NAME="520"></A>the real things also are at the same time 'both so and not so'. And it 
<A NAME="521"></A>is in this direction that the consequences are most difficult. For if those 
<A NAME="522"></A>who have seen most of such truth as is possible for us (and these are those 
<A NAME="523"></A>who seek and love it most)-if these have such opinions and express these 
<A NAME="524"></A>views about the truth, is it not natural that beginners in philosophy should 
<A NAME="525"></A>lose heart? For to seek the truth would be to follow flying game. <BR><BR>"But 
<A NAME="526"></A>the reason why these thinkers held this opinion is that while they were 
<A NAME="527"></A>inquiring into the truth of that which is, they thought, 'that which is' 
<A NAME="528"></A>was identical with the sensible world; in this, however, there is largely 
<A NAME="529"></A>present the nature of the indeterminate-of that which exists in the peculiar 
<A NAME="530"></A>sense which we have explained; and therefore, while they speak plausibly, 
<A NAME="531"></A>they do not say what is true (for it is fitting to put the matter so rather 
<A NAME="532"></A>than as Epicharmus put it against Xenophanes). And again, because they 
<A NAME="533"></A>saw that all this world of nature is in movement and that about that which 
<A NAME="534"></A>changes no true statement can be made, they said that of course, regarding 
<A NAME="535"></A>that which everywhere in every respect is changing, nothing could truly 
<A NAME="536"></A>be affirmed. It was this belief that blossomed into the most extreme of 
<A NAME="537"></A>the views above mentioned, that of the professed Heracliteans, such as 
<A NAME="538"></A>was held by Cratylus, who finally did not think it right to say anything 
<A NAME="539"></A>but only moved his finger, and criticized Heraclitus for saying that it 
<A NAME="540"></A>is impossible to step twice into the same river; for he thought one could 
<A NAME="541"></A>not do it even once. <BR><BR>"But we shall say in answer to this argument 
<A NAME="542"></A>also that while there is some justification for their thinking that the 
<A NAME="543"></A>changing, when it is changing, does not exist, yet it is after all disputable; 
<A NAME="544"></A>for that which is losing a quality has something of that which is being 
<A NAME="545"></A>lost, and of that which is coming to be, something must already be. And 
<A NAME="546"></A>in general if a thing is perishing, will be present something that exists; 
<A NAME="547"></A>and if a thing is coming to be, there must be something from which it comes 
<A NAME="548"></A>to be and something by which it is generated, and this process cannot go 
<A NAME="549"></A>on ad infinitum.-But, leaving these arguments, let us insist on this, that 
<A NAME="550"></A>it is not the same thing to change in quantity and in quality. Grant that 
<A NAME="551"></A>in quantity a thing is not constant; still it is in respect of its form 
<A NAME="552"></A>that we know each thing.-And again, it would be fair to criticize those 
<A NAME="553"></A>who hold this view for asserting about the whole material universe what 
<A NAME="554"></A>they saw only in a minority even of sensible things. For only that region 
<A NAME="555"></A>of the sensible world which immediately surrounds us is always in process 
<A NAME="556"></A>of destruction and generation; but this is-so to speak-not even a fraction 
<A NAME="557"></A>of the whole, so that it would have been juster to acquit this part of 
<A NAME="558"></A>the world because of the other part, than to condemn the other because 
<A NAME="559"></A>of this.-And again, obviously we shall make to them also the same reply 
<A NAME="560"></A>that we made long ago; we must show them and persuade them that there is 
<A NAME="561"></A>something whose nature is changeless. Indeed, those who say that things 
<A NAME="562"></A>at the same time are and are not, should in consequence say that all things 
<A NAME="563"></A>are at rest rather than that they are in movement; for there is nothing 
<A NAME="564"></A>into which they can change, since all attributes belong already to all 
<A NAME="565"></A>subjects. <BR><BR>"Regarding the nature of truth, we must maintain that 
<A NAME="566"></A>not everything which appears is true; firstly, because even if sensation-at 
<A NAME="567"></A>least of the object peculiar to the sense in question-is not false, still 
<A NAME="568"></A>appearance is not the same as sensation.-Again, it is fair to express surprise 
<A NAME="569"></A>at our opponents' raising the question whether magnitudes are as great, 
<A NAME="570"></A>and colours are of such a nature, as they appear to people at a distance, 
<A NAME="571"></A>or as they appear to those close at hand, and whether they are such as 
<A NAME="572"></A>they appear to the healthy or to the sick, and whether those things are 
<A NAME="573"></A>heavy which appear so to the weak or those which appear so to the strong, 
<A NAME="574"></A>and those things true which appear to the slee ing or to the waking. For 
<A NAME="575"></A>obviously they do not think these to be open questions; no one, at least, 
<A NAME="576"></A>if when he is in Libya he has fancied one night that he is in Athens, starts 
<A NAME="577"></A>for the concert hall.-And again with regard to the future, as Plato says, 
<A NAME="578"></A>surely the opinion of the physician and that of the ignorant man are not 
<A NAME="579"></A>equally weighty, for instance, on the question whether a man will get well 
<A NAME="580"></A>or not.-And again, among sensations themselves the sensation of a foreign 
<A NAME="581"></A>object and that of the appropriate object, or that of a kindred object 
<A NAME="582"></A>and that of the object of the sense in question, are not equally authoritative, 
<A NAME="583"></A>but in the case of colour sight, not taste, has the authority, and in the 
<A NAME="584"></A>case of flavour taste, not sight; each of which senses never says at the 
<A NAME="585"></A>same time of the same object that it simultaneously is 'so and not so'.-But 
<A NAME="586"></A>not even at different times does one sense disagree about the quality, 
<A NAME="587"></A>but only about that to which the quality belongs. I mean, for instance, 
<A NAME="588"></A>that the same wine might seem, if either it or one's body changed, at one 
<A NAME="589"></A>time sweet and at another time not sweet; but at least the sweet, such 
<A NAME="590"></A>as it is when it exists, has never yet changed, but one is always right 
<A NAME="591"></A>about it, and that which is to be sweet is of necessity of such and such 
<A NAME="592"></A>a nature. Yet all these views destroy this necessity, leaving nothing to 
<A NAME="593"></A>be of necessity, as they leave no essence of anything; for the necessary 
<A NAME="594"></A>cannot be in this way and also in that, so that if anything is of necessity, 
<A NAME="595"></A>it will not be 'both so and not so'. <BR><BR>"And, in general, if only 
<A NAME="596"></A>the sensible exists, there would be nothing if animate things were not; 
<A NAME="597"></A>for there would be no faculty of sense. Now the view that neither the sensible 
<A NAME="598"></A>qualities nor the sensations would exist is doubtless true (for they are 
<A NAME="599"></A>affections of the perceiver), but that the substrata which cause the sensation 
<A NAME="600"></A>should not exist even apart from sensation is impossible. For sensation 
<A NAME="601"></A>is surely not the sensation of itself, but there is something beyond the 
<A NAME="602"></A>sensation, which must be prior to the sensation; for that which moves is 
<A NAME="603"></A>prior in nature to that which is moved, and if they are correlative terms, 
<A NAME="604"></A>this is no less the case.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="605"></A><B>Part 6</B>
<A NAME="606"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="607"></A><BR><BR>"There are, both among those who have these convictions and among 
<A NAME="608"></A>those who merely profess these views, some who raise a difficulty by asking, 
<A NAME="609"></A>who is to be the judge of the healthy man, and in general who is likely 
<A NAME="610"></A>to judge rightly on each class of questions. But such inquiries are like 
<A NAME="611"></A>puzzling over the question whether we are now asleep or awake. And all 
<A NAME="612"></A>such questions have the same meaning. These people demand that a reason 
<A NAME="613"></A>shall be given for everything; for they seek a starting-point, and they 
<A NAME="614"></A>seek to get this by demonstration, while it is obvious from their actions 
<A NAME="615"></A>that they have no conviction. But their mistake is what we have stated 
<A NAME="616"></A>it to be; they seek a reason for things for which no reason can be given; 
<A NAME="617"></A>for the starting-point of demonstration is not demonstration. <BR><BR>"These, 
<A NAME="618"></A>then, might be easily persuaded of this truth, for it is not difficult 
<A NAME="619"></A>to grasp; but those who seek merely compulsion in argument seek what is 
<A NAME="620"></A>impossible; for they demand to be allowed to contradict themselves-a claim 
<A NAME="621"></A>which contradicts itself from the very first.-But if not all things are 
<A NAME="622"></A>relative, but some are self-existent, not everything that appears will 
<A NAME="623"></A>be true; for that which appears is apparent to some one; so that he who 
<A NAME="624"></A>says all things that appear are true, makes all things relative. And, therefore, 
<A NAME="625"></A>those who ask for an irresistible argument, and at the same time demand 
<A NAME="626"></A>to be called to account for their views, must guard themselves by saying 
<A NAME="627"></A>that the truth is not that what appears exists, but that what appears exists 
<A NAME="628"></A>for him to whom it appears, and when, and to the sense to which, and under 
<A NAME="629"></A>the conditions under which it appears. And if they give an account of their 
<A NAME="630"></A>view, but do not give it in this way, they will soon find themselves contradicting 
<A NAME="631"></A>themselves. For it is possible that the same thing may appear to be honey 
<A NAME="632"></A>to the sight, but not to the taste, and that, since we have two eyes, things 
<A NAME="633"></A>may not appear the same to each, if their sight is unlike. For to those 
<A NAME="634"></A>who for the reasons named some time ago say that what appears is true, 
<A NAME="635"></A>and therefore that all things are alike false and true, for things do not 
<A NAME="636"></A>appear either the same to all men or always the same to the same man, but 
<A NAME="637"></A>often have contrary appearances at the same time (for touch says there 
<A NAME="638"></A>are two objects when we cross our fingers, while sight says there is one)-to 
<A NAME="639"></A>these we shall say 'yes, but not to the same sense and in the same part 
<A NAME="640"></A>of it and under the same conditions and at the same time', so that what 
<A NAME="641"></A>appears will be with these qualifications true. But perhaps for this reason 
<A NAME="642"></A>those who argue thus not because they feel a difficulty but for the sake 
<A NAME="643"></A>of argument, should say that this is not true, but true for this man. And 
<A NAME="644"></A>as has been said before, they must make everything relative-relative to 
<A NAME="645"></A>opinion and perception, so that nothing either has come to be or will be 
<A NAME="646"></A>without some one's first thinking so. But if things have come to be or 
<A NAME="647"></A>will be, evidently not all things will be relative to opinion.-Again, if 
<A NAME="648"></A>a thing is one, it is in relation to one thing or to a definite number 
<A NAME="649"></A>of things; and if the same thing is both half and equal, it is not to the 
<A NAME="650"></A>double that the equal is correlative. If, then, in relation to that which 
<A NAME="651"></A>thinks, man and that which is thought are the same, man will not be that 
<A NAME="652"></A>which thinks, but only that which is thought. And if each thing is to be 
<A NAME="653"></A>relative to that which thinks, that which thinks will be relative to an 
<A NAME="654"></A>infinity of specifically different things. <BR><BR>"Let this, then, suffice 
<A NAME="655"></A>to show (1) that the most indisputable of all beliefs is that contradictory 
<A NAME="656"></A>statements are not at the same time true, and (2) what consequences follow 
<A NAME="657"></A>from the assertion that they are, and (3) why people do assert this. Now 
<A NAME="658"></A>since it is impossible that contradictories should be at the same time 
<A NAME="659"></A>true of the same thing, obviously contraries also cannot belong at the 
<A NAME="660"></A>same time to the same thing. For of contraries, one is a privation no less 
<A NAME="661"></A>than it is a contrary-and a privation of the essential nature; and privation 
<A NAME="662"></A>is the denial of a predicate to a determinate genus. If, then, it is impossible 
<A NAME="663"></A>to affirm and deny truly at the same time, it is also impossible that contraries 
<A NAME="664"></A>should belong to a subject at the same time, unless both belong to it in 
<A NAME="665"></A>particular relations, or one in a particular relation and one without 
<A NAME="666"></A>qualification.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="667"></A><B>Part 7</B>
<A NAME="668"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>"But on the other hand there cannot be an intermediate between 
<A NAME="670"></A>contradictories, but of one subject we must either affirm or deny any one 
<A NAME="671"></A>predicate. This is clear, in the first place, if we define what the true 
<A NAME="672"></A>and the false are. To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not 
<A NAME="673"></A>that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is 
<A NAME="674"></A>not that it is not, is true; so that he who says of anything that it is, 
<A NAME="675"></A>or that it is not, will say either what is true or what is false; but neither 
<A NAME="676"></A>what is nor what is not is said to be or not to be.-Again, the intermediate 
<A NAME="677"></A>between the contradictories will be so either in the way in which grey 
<A NAME="678"></A>is between black and white, or as that which is neither man nor horse is 
<A NAME="679"></A>between man and horse. (a) If it were of the latter kind, it could not 
<A NAME="680"></A>change into the extremes (for change is from not-good to good, or from 
<A NAME="681"></A>good to not-good), but as a matter of fact when there is an intermediate 
<A NAME="682"></A>it is always observed to change into the extremes. For there is no change 
<A NAME="683"></A>except to opposites and to their intermediates. (b) But if it is really 
<A NAME="684"></A>intermediate, in this way too there would have to be a change to white, 
<A NAME="685"></A>which was not from not-white; but as it is, this is never seen.-Again, 
<A NAME="686"></A>every object of understanding or reason the understanding either affirms 
<A NAME="687"></A>or denies-this is obvious from the definition-whenever it says what is 
<A NAME="688"></A>true or false. When it connects in one way by assertion or negation, it 
<A NAME="689"></A>says what is true, and when it does so in another way, what is false.-Again, 
<A NAME="690"></A>there must be an intermediate between all contradictories, if one is not 
<A NAME="691"></A>arguing merely for the sake of argument; so that it will be possible for 
<A NAME="692"></A>a man to say what is neither true nor untrue, and there will be a middle 
<A NAME="693"></A>between that which is and that which is not, so that there will also be 
<A NAME="694"></A>a kind of change intermediate between generation and destruction.-Again, 
<A NAME="695"></A>in all classes in which the negation of an attribute involves the assertion 
<A NAME="696"></A>of its contrary, even in these there will be an intermediate; for instance, 
<A NAME="697"></A>in the sphere of numbers there will be number which is neither odd nor 
<A NAME="698"></A>not-odd. But this is impossible, as is obvious from the definition.-Again, 
<A NAME="699"></A>the process will go on ad infinitum, and the number of realities will be 
<A NAME="700"></A>not only half as great again, but even greater. For again it will be possible 
<A NAME="701"></A>to deny this intermediate with reference both to its assertion and to its 
<A NAME="702"></A>negation, and this new term will be some definite thing; for its essence 
<A NAME="703"></A>is something different.-Again, when a man, on being asked whether a thing 
<A NAME="704"></A>is white, says 'no', he has denied nothing except that it is; and its not 
<A NAME="705"></A>being is a negation. <BR><BR>"Some people have acquired this opinion as 
<A NAME="706"></A>other paradoxical opinions have been acquired; when men cannot refute eristical 
<A NAME="707"></A>arguments, they give in to the argument and agree that the conclusion is 
<A NAME="708"></A>true. This, then, is why some express this view; others do so because they 
<A NAME="709"></A>demand a reason for everything. And the starting-point in dealing with 
<A NAME="710"></A>all such people is definition. Now the definition rests on the necessity 
<A NAME="711"></A>of their meaning something; for the form of words of which the word is 
<A NAME="712"></A>a sign will be its definition.-While the doctrine of Heraclitus, that all 
<A NAME="713"></A>things are and are not, seems to make everything true, that of Anaxagoras, 
<A NAME="714"></A>that there is an intermediate between the terms of a contradiction, seems 
<A NAME="715"></A>to make everything false; for when things are mixed, the mixture is neither 
<A NAME="716"></A>good nor not-good, so that one cannot say anything that is 
<A NAME="717"></A>true.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="718"></A><B>Part 8</B>
<A NAME="719"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR>"In view of these distinctions it is obvious that the one-sided 
<A NAME="721"></A>theories which some people express about all things cannot be valid-on 
<A NAME="722"></A>the one hand the theory that nothing is true (for, say they, there is nothing 
<A NAME="723"></A>to prevent every statement from being like the statement 'the diagonal 
<A NAME="724"></A>of a square is commensurate with the side'), on the other hand the theory 
<A NAME="725"></A>that everything is true. These views are practically the same as that of 
<A NAME="726"></A>Heraclitus; for he who says that all things are true and all are false 
<A NAME="727"></A>also makes each of these statements separately, so that since they are 
<A NAME="728"></A>impossible, the double statement must be impossible too.-Again, there are 
<A NAME="729"></A>obviously contradictories which cannot be at the same time true-nor on 
<A NAME="730"></A>the other hand can all statements be false; yet this would seem more possible 
<A NAME="731"></A>in the light of what has been said.-But against all such views we must 
<A NAME="732"></A>postulate, as we said above,' not that something is or is not, but that 
<A NAME="733"></A>something has a meaning, so that we must argue from a definition, viz. 
<A NAME="734"></A>by assuming what falsity or truth means. If that which it is true to affirm 
<A NAME="735"></A>is nothing other than that which it is false to deny, it is impossible 
<A NAME="736"></A>that all statements should be false; for one side of the contradiction 
<A NAME="737"></A>must be true. Again, if it is necessary with regard to everything either 
<A NAME="738"></A>to assert or to deny it, it is impossible that both should be false; for 
<A NAME="739"></A>it is one side of the contradiction that is false.-Therefore all such views 
<A NAME="740"></A>are also exposed to the often expressed objection, that they destroy themselves. 
<A NAME="741"></A>For he who says that everything is true makes even the statement contrary 
<A NAME="742"></A>to his own true, and therefore his own not true (for the contrary statement 
<A NAME="743"></A>denies that it is true), while he who says everything is false makes himself 
<A NAME="744"></A>also false.-And if the former person excepts the contrary statement, saying 
<A NAME="745"></A>it alone is not true, while the latter excepts his own as being not false, 
<A NAME="746"></A>none the less they are driven to postulate the truth or falsity of an infinite 
<A NAME="747"></A>number of statements; for that which says the true statement is true is 
<A NAME="748"></A>true, and this process will go on to infinity. <BR><BR>"Evidently, again, 
<A NAME="749"></A>those who say all things are at rest are not right, nor are those who say 
<A NAME="750"></A>all things are in movement. For if all things are at rest, the same statements 
<A NAME="751"></A>will always be true and the same always false,-but this obviously changes; 
<A NAME="752"></A>for he who makes a statement, himself at one time was not and again will 
<A NAME="753"></A>not be. And if all things are in motion, nothing will be true; everything 
<A NAME="754"></A>therefore will be false. But it has been shown that this is impossible. 
<A NAME="755"></A>Again, it must be that which is that changes; for change is from something 
<A NAME="756"></A>to something. But again it is not the case that all things are at rest 
<A NAME="757"></A>or in motion sometimes, and nothing for ever; for there is something which 
<A NAME="758"></A>always moves the things that are in motion, and the first mover is itself 
<A NAME="759"></A>unmoved.
