<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="12"></A><BR><BR>"THERE are several senses in which a thing may be said to 'be', 
<A NAME="13"></A>as we pointed out previously in our book on the various senses of words;' 
<A NAME="14"></A>for in one sense the 'being' meant is 'what a thing is' or a 'this', and 
<A NAME="15"></A>in another sense it means a quality or quantity or one of the other things 
<A NAME="16"></A>that are predicated as these are. While 'being' has all these senses, obviously 
<A NAME="17"></A>that which 'is' primarily is the 'what', which indicates the substance 
<A NAME="18"></A>of the thing. For when we say of what quality a thing is, we say that it 
<A NAME="19"></A>is good or bad, not that it is three cubits long or that it is a man; but 
<A NAME="20"></A>when we say what it is, we do not say 'white' or 'hot' or 'three cubits 
<A NAME="21"></A>long', but 'a man' or 'a 'god'. And all other things are said to be because 
<A NAME="22"></A>they are, some of them, quantities of that which is in this primary sense, 
<A NAME="23"></A>others qualities of it, others affections of it, and others some other 
<A NAME="24"></A>determination of it. And so one might even raise the question whether the 
<A NAME="25"></A>words 'to walk', 'to be healthy', 'to sit' imply that each of these things 
<A NAME="26"></A>is existent, and similarly in any other case of this sort; for none of 
<A NAME="27"></A>them is either self-subsistent or capable of being separated from substance, 
<A NAME="28"></A>but rather, if anything, it is that which walks or sits or is healthy that 
<A NAME="29"></A>is an existent thing. Now these are seen to be more real because there 
<A NAME="30"></A>is something definite which underlies them (i.e. the substance or individual), 
<A NAME="31"></A>which is implied in such a predicate; for we never use the word 'good' 
<A NAME="32"></A>or 'sitting' without implying this. Clearly then it is in virtue of this 
<A NAME="33"></A>category that each of the others also is. Therefore that which is primarily, 
<A NAME="34"></A>i.e. not in a qualified sense but without qualification, must be substance. 
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>"Now there are several senses in which a thing is said to be first; 
<A NAME="36"></A>yet substance is first in every sense-(1) in definition, (2) in order of 
<A NAME="37"></A>knowledge, (3) in time. For (3) of the other categories none can exist 
<A NAME="38"></A>independently, but only substance. And (1) in definition also this is first; 
<A NAME="39"></A>for in the definition of each term the definition of its substance must 
<A NAME="40"></A>be present. And (2) we think we know each thing most fully, when we know 
<A NAME="41"></A>what it is, e.g. what man is or what fire is, rather than when we know 
<A NAME="42"></A>its quality, its quantity, or its place; since we know each of these predicates 
<A NAME="43"></A>also, only when we know what the quantity or the quality is. <BR><BR>"And 
<A NAME="44"></A>indeed the question which was raised of old and is raised now and always, 
<A NAME="45"></A>and is always the subject of doubt, viz. what being is, is just the question, 
<A NAME="46"></A>what is substance? For it is this that some assert to be one, others more 
<A NAME="47"></A>than one, and that some assert to be limited in number, others unlimited. 
<A NAME="48"></A>And so we also must consider chiefly and primarily and almost exclusively 
<A NAME="49"></A>what that is which is in this sense.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="50"></A><B>Part 2</B>
<A NAME="51"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="52"></A><BR><BR>"Substance is thought to belong most obviously to bodies; and so 
<A NAME="53"></A>we say that not only animals and plants and their parts are substances, 
<A NAME="54"></A>but also natural bodies such as fire and water and earth and everything 
<A NAME="55"></A>of the sort, and all things that are either parts of these or composed 
<A NAME="56"></A>of these (either of parts or of the whole bodies), e.g. the physical universe 
<A NAME="57"></A>and its parts, stars and moon and sun. But whether these alone are substances, 
<A NAME="58"></A>or there are also others, or only some of these, or others as well, or 
<A NAME="59"></A>none of these but only some other things, are substances, must be considered. 
<A NAME="60"></A>Some think the limits of body, i.e. surface, line, point, and unit, are 
<A NAME="61"></A>substances, and more so than body or the solid. <BR><BR>"Further, some 
<A NAME="62"></A>do not think there is anything substantial besides sensible things, but 
<A NAME="63"></A>others think there are eternal substances which are more in number and 
<A NAME="64"></A>more real; e.g. Plato posited two kinds of substance-the Forms and objects 
<A NAME="65"></A>of mathematics-as well as a third kind, viz. the substance of sensible 
<A NAME="66"></A>bodies. And Speusippus made still more kinds of substance, beginning with 
<A NAME="67"></A>the One, and assuming principles for each kind of substance, one for numbers, 
<A NAME="68"></A>another for spatial magnitudes, and then another for the soul; and by going 
<A NAME="69"></A>on in this way he multiplies the kinds of substance. And some say Forms 
<A NAME="70"></A>and numbers have the same nature, and the other things come after them-lines 
<A NAME="71"></A>and planes-until we come to the substance of the material universe and 
<A NAME="72"></A>to sensible bodies. <BR><BR>"Regarding these matters, then, we must inquire 
<A NAME="73"></A>which of the common statements are right and which are not right, and what 
<A NAME="74"></A>substances there are, and whether there are or are not any besides sensible 
<A NAME="75"></A>substances, and how sensible substances exist, and whether there is a substance 
<A NAME="76"></A>capable of separate existence (and if so why and how) or no such substance, 
<A NAME="77"></A>apart from sensible substances; and we must first sketch the nature of 
<A NAME="78"></A>substance.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="79"></A><B>Part 3</B>
<A NAME="80"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="81"></A><BR><BR>"The word 'substance' is applied, if not in more senses, still 
<A NAME="82"></A>at least to four main objects; for both the essence and the universal and 
<A NAME="83"></A>the genus, are thought to be the substance of each thing, and fourthly 
<A NAME="84"></A>the substratum. Now the substratum is that of which everything else is 
<A NAME="85"></A>predicated, while it is itself not predicated of anything else. And so 
<A NAME="86"></A>we must first determine the nature of this; for that which underlies a 
<A NAME="87"></A>thing primarily is thought to be in the truest sense its substance. And 
<A NAME="88"></A>in one sense matter is said to be of the nature of substratum, in another, 
<A NAME="89"></A>shape, and in a third, the compound of these. (By the matter I mean, for 
<A NAME="90"></A>instance, the bronze, by the shape the pattern of its form, and by the 
<A NAME="91"></A>compound of these the statue, the concrete whole.) Therefore if the form 
<A NAME="92"></A>is prior to the matter and more real, it will be prior also to the compound 
<A NAME="93"></A>of both, for the same reason. <BR><BR>"We have now outlined the nature 
<A NAME="94"></A>of substance, showing that it is that which is not predicated of a stratum, 
<A NAME="95"></A>but of which all else is predicated. But we must not merely state the matter 
<A NAME="96"></A>thus; for this is not enough. The statement itself is obscure, and further, 
<A NAME="97"></A>on this view, matter becomes substance. For if this is not substance, it 
<A NAME="98"></A>baffles us to say what else is. When all else is stripped off evidently 
<A NAME="99"></A>nothing but matter remains. For while the rest are affections, products, 
<A NAME="100"></A>and potencies of bodies, length, breadth, and depth are quantities and 
<A NAME="101"></A>not substances (for a quantity is not a substance), but the substance is 
<A NAME="102"></A>rather that to which these belong primarily. But when length and breadth 
<A NAME="103"></A>and depth are taken away we see nothing left unless there is something 
<A NAME="104"></A>that is bounded by these; so that to those who consider the question thus 
<A NAME="105"></A>matter alone must seem to be substance. By matter I mean that which in 
<A NAME="106"></A>itself is neither a particular thing nor of a certain quantity nor assigned 
<A NAME="107"></A>to any other of the categories by which being is determined. For there 
<A NAME="108"></A>is something of which each of these is predicated, whose being is different 
<A NAME="109"></A>from that of each of the predicates (for the predicates other than substance 
<A NAME="110"></A>are predicated of substance, while substance is predicated of matter). 
<A NAME="111"></A>Therefore the ultimate substratum is of itself neither a particular thing 
<A NAME="112"></A>nor of a particular quantity nor otherwise positively characterized; nor 
<A NAME="113"></A>yet is it the negations of these, for negations also will belong to it 
<A NAME="114"></A>only by accident. <BR><BR>"If we adopt this point of view, then, it follows 
<A NAME="115"></A>that matter is substance. But this is impossible; for both separability 
<A NAME="116"></A>and 'thisness' are thought to belong chiefly to substance. And so form 
<A NAME="117"></A>and the compound of form and matter would be thought to be substance, rather 
<A NAME="118"></A>than matter. The substance compounded of both, i.e. of matter and shape, 
<A NAME="119"></A>may be dismissed; for it is posterior and its nature is obvious. And matter 
<A NAME="120"></A>also is in a sense manifest. But we must inquire into the third kind of 
<A NAME="121"></A>substance; for this is the most perplexing. <BR><BR>"Some of the sensible 
<A NAME="122"></A>substances are generally admitted to be substances, so that we must look 
<A NAME="123"></A>first among these. For it is an advantage to advance to that which is more 
<A NAME="124"></A>knowable. For learning proceeds for all in this way-through that which 
<A NAME="125"></A>is less knowable by nature to that which is more knowable; and just as 
<A NAME="126"></A>in conduct our task is to start from what is good for each and make what 
<A NAME="127"></A>is without qualification good good for each, so it is our task to start 
<A NAME="128"></A>from what is more knowable to oneself and make what is knowable by nature 
<A NAME="129"></A>knowable to oneself. Now what is knowable and primary for particular sets 
<A NAME="130"></A>of people is often knowable to a very small extent, and has little or nothing 
<A NAME="131"></A>of reality. But yet one must start from that which is barely knowable but 
<A NAME="132"></A>knowable to oneself, and try to know what is knowable without qualification, 
<A NAME="133"></A>passing, as has been said, by way of those very things which one does 
<A NAME="134"></A>know.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="135"></A><B>Part 4</B>
<A NAME="136"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>"Since at the start we distinguished the various marks by which 
<A NAME="138"></A>we determine substance, and one of these was thought to be the essence, 
<A NAME="139"></A>we must investigate this. And first let us make some linguistic remarks 
<A NAME="140"></A>about it. The essence of each thing is what it is said to be propter se. 
<A NAME="141"></A>For being you is not being musical, since you are not by your very nature 
<A NAME="142"></A>musical. What, then, you are by your very nature is your essence. <BR><BR>"Nor 
<A NAME="143"></A>yet is the whole of this the essence of a thing; not that which is propter 
<A NAME="144"></A>se as white is to a surface, because being a surface is not identical with 
<A NAME="145"></A>being white. But again the combination of both-'being a white surface'-is 
<A NAME="146"></A>not the essence of surface, because 'surface' itself is added. The formula, 
<A NAME="147"></A>therefore, in which the term itself is not present but its meaning is expressed, 
<A NAME="148"></A>this is the formula of the essence of each thing. Therefore if to be a 
<A NAME="149"></A>white surface is to be a smooth surface, to be white and to be smooth are 
<A NAME="150"></A>one and the same. <BR><BR>"But since there are also compounds answering 
<A NAME="151"></A>to the other categories (for there is a substratum for each category, e.g. 
<A NAME="152"></A>for quality, quantity, time, place, and motion), we must inquire whether 
<A NAME="153"></A>there is a formula of the essence of each of them, i.e. whether to these 
<A NAME="154"></A>compounds also there belongs an essence, e.g. 'white man'. Let the compound 
<A NAME="155"></A>be denoted by 'cloak'. What is the essence of cloak? But, it may be said, 
<A NAME="156"></A>this also is not a propter se expression. We reply that there are just 
<A NAME="157"></A>two ways in which a predicate may fail to be true of a subject propter 
<A NAME="158"></A>se, and one of these results from the addition, and the other from the 
<A NAME="159"></A>omission, of a determinant. One kind of predicate is not propter se because 
<A NAME="160"></A>the term that is being defined is combined with another determinant, e.g. 
<A NAME="161"></A>if in defining the essence of white one were to state the formula of white 
<A NAME="162"></A>man; the other because in the subject another determinant is combined with 
<A NAME="163"></A>that which is expressed in the formula, e.g. if 'cloak' meant 'white man', 
<A NAME="164"></A>and one were to define cloak as white; white man is white indeed, but its 
<A NAME="165"></A>essence is not to be white. <BR><BR>"But is being-a-cloak an essence at 
<A NAME="166"></A>all? Probably not. For the essence is precisely what something is; but 
<A NAME="167"></A>when an attribute is asserted of a subject other than itself, the complex 
<A NAME="168"></A>is not precisely what some 'this' is, e.g. white man is not precisely what 
<A NAME="169"></A>some 'this' is, since thisness belongs only to substances. Therefore there 
<A NAME="170"></A>is an essence only of those things whose formula is a definition. But we 
<A NAME="171"></A>have a definition not where we have a word and a formula identical in meaning 
<A NAME="172"></A>(for in that case all formulae or sets of words would be definitions; for 
<A NAME="173"></A>there will be some name for any set of words whatever, so that even the 
<A NAME="174"></A>Iliad will be a definition), but where there is a formula of something 
<A NAME="175"></A>primary; and primary things are those which do not imply the predication 
<A NAME="176"></A>of one element in them of another element. Nothing, then, which is not 
<A NAME="177"></A>a species of a genus will have an essence-only species will have it, for 
<A NAME="178"></A>these are thought to imply not merely that the subject participates in 
<A NAME="179"></A>the attribute and has it as an affection, or has it by accident; but for 
<A NAME="180"></A>ever thing else as well, if it has a name, there be a formula of its meaning-viz. 
<A NAME="181"></A>that this attribute belongs to this subject; or instead of a simple formula 
<A NAME="182"></A>we shall be able to give a more accurate one; but there will be no definition 
<A NAME="183"></A>nor essence. <BR><BR>"Or has 'definition', like 'what a thing is', several 
<A NAME="184"></A>meanings? 'What a thing is' in one sense means substance and the 'this', 
<A NAME="185"></A>in another one or other of the predicates, quantity, quality, and the like. 
<A NAME="186"></A>For as 'is' belongs to all things, not however in the same sense, but to 
<A NAME="187"></A>one sort of thing primarily and to others in a secondary way, so too 'what 
<A NAME="188"></A>a thing is' belongs in the simple sense to substance, but in a limited 
<A NAME="189"></A>sense to the other categories. For even of a quality we might ask what 
<A NAME="190"></A>it is, so that quality also is a 'what a thing is',-not in the simple sense, 
<A NAME="191"></A>however, but just as, in the case of that which is not, some say, emphasizing 
<A NAME="192"></A>the linguistic form, that that is which is not is-not is simply, but is 
<A NAME="193"></A>non-existent; so too with quality. <BR><BR>"We must no doubt inquire how 
<A NAME="194"></A>we should express ourselves on each point, but certainly not more than 
<A NAME="195"></A>how the facts actually stand. And so now also, since it is evident what 
<A NAME="196"></A>language we use, essence will belong, just as 'what a thing is' does, primarily 
<A NAME="197"></A>and in the simple sense to substance, and in a secondary way to the other 
<A NAME="198"></A>categories also,-not essence in the simple sense, but the essence of a 
<A NAME="199"></A>quality or of a quantity. For it must be either by an equivocation that 
<A NAME="200"></A>we say these are, or by adding to and taking from the meaning of 'are' 
<A NAME="201"></A>(in the way in which that which is not known may be said to be known),-the 
<A NAME="202"></A>truth being that we use the word neither ambiguously nor in the same sense, 
<A NAME="203"></A>but just as we apply the word 'medical' by virtue of a reference to one 
<A NAME="204"></A>and the same thing, not meaning one and the same thing, nor yet speaking 
<A NAME="205"></A>ambiguously; for a patient and an operation and an instrument are called 
<A NAME="206"></A>medical neither by an ambiguity nor with a single meaning, but with reference 
<A NAME="207"></A>to a common end. But it does not matter at all in which of the two ways 
<A NAME="208"></A>one likes to describe the facts; this is evident, that definition and essence 
<A NAME="209"></A>in the primary and simple sense belong to substances. Still they belong 
<A NAME="210"></A>to other things as well, only not in the primary sense. For if we suppose 
<A NAME="211"></A>this it does not follow that there is a definition of every word which 
<A NAME="212"></A>means the same as any formula; it must mean the same as a particular kind 
<A NAME="213"></A>of formula; and this condition is satisfied if it is a formula of something 
<A NAME="214"></A>which is one, not by continuity like the Iliad or the things that are one 
<A NAME="215"></A>by being bound together, but in one of the main senses of 'one', which 
<A NAME="216"></A>answer to the senses of 'is'; now 'that which is' in one sense denotes 
<A NAME="217"></A>a 'this', in another a quantity, in another a quality. And so there can 
<A NAME="218"></A>be a formula or definition even of white man, but not in the sense in which 
<A NAME="219"></A>there is a definition either of white or of a substance.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="220"></A><B>Part 5</B>
<A NAME="221"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>"It is a difficult question, if one denies that a formula with 
<A NAME="223"></A>an added determinant is a definition, whether any of the terms that are 
<A NAME="224"></A>not simple but coupled will be definable. For we must explain them by adding 
<A NAME="225"></A>a determinant. E.g. there is the nose, and concavity, and snubness, which 
<A NAME="226"></A>is compounded out of the two by the presence of the one in the other, and 
<A NAME="227"></A>it is not by accident that the nose has the attribute either of concavity 
<A NAME="228"></A>or of snubness, but in virtue of its nature; nor do they attach to it as 
<A NAME="229"></A>whiteness does to Callias, or to man (because Callias, who happens to be 
<A NAME="230"></A>a man, is white), but as 'male' attaches to animal and 'equal' to quantity, 
<A NAME="231"></A>and as all so-called 'attributes propter se' attach to their subjects. 
<A NAME="232"></A>And such attributes are those in which is involved either the formula or 
<A NAME="233"></A>the name of the subject of the particular attribute, and which cannot be 
<A NAME="234"></A>explained without this; e.g. white can be explained apart from man, but 
<A NAME="235"></A>not female apart from animal. Therefore there is either no essence and 
<A NAME="236"></A>definition of any of these things, or if there is, it is in another sense, 
<A NAME="237"></A>as we have said. <BR><BR>"But there is also a second difficulty about them. 
<A NAME="238"></A>For if snub nose and concave nose are the same thing, snub and concave 
<A NAME="239"></A>will be the thing; but if snub and concave are not the same (because it 
<A NAME="240"></A>is impossible to speak of snubness apart from the thing of which it is 
<A NAME="241"></A>an attribute propter se, for snubness is concavity-in-a-nose), either it 
<A NAME="242"></A>is impossible to say 'snub nose' or the same thing will have been said 
<A NAME="243"></A>twice, concave-nose nose; for snub nose will be concave-nose nose. And 
<A NAME="244"></A>so it is absurd that such things should have an essence; if they have, 
<A NAME="245"></A>there will be an infinite regress; for in snub-nose nose yet another 'nose' 
<A NAME="246"></A>will be involved. <BR><BR>"Clearly, then, only substance is definable. 
<A NAME="247"></A>For if the other categories also are definable, it must be by addition 
<A NAME="248"></A>of a determinant, e.g. the qualitative is defined thus, and so is the odd, 
<A NAME="249"></A>for it cannot be defined apart from number; nor can female be defined apart 
<A NAME="250"></A>from animal. (When I say 'by addition' I mean the expressions in which 
<A NAME="251"></A>it turns out that we are saying the same thing twice, as in these instances.) 
<A NAME="252"></A>And if this is true, coupled terms also, like 'odd number', will not be 
<A NAME="253"></A>definable (but this escapes our notice because our formulae are not accurate.). 
<A NAME="254"></A>But if these also are definable, either it is in some other way or, as 
<A NAME="255"></A>we definition and essence must be said to have more than one sense. Therefore 
<A NAME="256"></A>in one sense nothing will have a definition and nothing will have an essence, 
<A NAME="257"></A>except substances, but in another sense other things will have them. Clearly, 
<A NAME="258"></A>then, definition is the formula of the essence, and essence belongs to 
<A NAME="259"></A>substances either alone or chiefly and primarily and in the unqualified 
<A NAME="260"></A>sense.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="261"></A><B>Part 6</B>
<A NAME="262"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>"We must inquire whether each thing and its essence are the same 
<A NAME="264"></A>or different. This is of some use for the inquiry concerning substance; 
<A NAME="265"></A>for each thing is thought to be not different from its substance, and the 
<A NAME="266"></A>essence is said to be the substance of each thing. <BR><BR>"Now in the 
<A NAME="267"></A>case of accidental unities the two would be generally thought to be different, 
<A NAME="268"></A>e.g. white man would be thought to be different from the essence of white 
<A NAME="269"></A>man. For if they are the same, the essence of man and that of white man 
<A NAME="270"></A>are also the same; for a man and a white man are the same thing, as people 
<A NAME="271"></A>say, so that the essence of white man and that of man would be also the 
<A NAME="272"></A>same. But perhaps it does not follow that the essence of accidental unities 
<A NAME="273"></A>should be the same as that of the simple terms. For the extreme terms are 
<A NAME="274"></A>not in the same way identical with the middle term. But perhaps this might 
<A NAME="275"></A>be thought to follow, that the extreme terms, the accidents, should turn 
<A NAME="276"></A>out to be the same, e.g. the essence of white and that of musical; but 
<A NAME="277"></A>this is not actually thought to be the case. <BR><BR>"But in the case of 
<A NAME="278"></A>so-called self-subsistent things, is a thing necessarily the same as its 
<A NAME="279"></A>essence? E.g. if there are some substances which have no other substances 
<A NAME="280"></A>nor entities prior to them-substances such as some assert the Ideas to 
<A NAME="281"></A>be?-If the essence of good is to be different from good-itself, and the 
<A NAME="282"></A>essence of animal from animal-itself, and the essence of being from being-itself, 
<A NAME="283"></A>there will, firstly, be other substances and entities and Ideas besides 
<A NAME="284"></A>those which are asserted, and, secondly, these others will be prior substances, 
<A NAME="285"></A>if essence is substance. And if the posterior substances and the prior 
<A NAME="286"></A>are severed from each other, (a) there will be no knowledge of the former, 
<A NAME="287"></A>and (b) the latter will have no being. (By 'severed' I mean, if the good-itself 
<A NAME="288"></A>has not the essence of good, and the latter has not the property of being 
<A NAME="289"></A>good.) For (a) there is knowledge of each thing only when we know its essence. 
<A NAME="290"></A>And (b) the case is the same for other things as for the good; so that 
<A NAME="291"></A>if the essence of good is not good, neither is the essence of reality real, 
<A NAME="292"></A>nor the essence of unity one. And all essences alike exist or none of them 
<A NAME="293"></A>does; so that if the essence of reality is not real, neither is any of 
<A NAME="294"></A>the others. Again, that to which the essence of good does not belong is 
<A NAME="295"></A>not good.-The good, then, must be one with the essence of good, and the 
<A NAME="296"></A>beautiful with the essence of beauty, and so with all things which do not 
<A NAME="297"></A>depend on something else but are self-subsistent and primary. For it is 
<A NAME="298"></A>enough if they are this, even if they are not Forms; or rather, perhaps, 
<A NAME="299"></A>even if they are Forms. (At the same time it is clear that if there are 
<A NAME="300"></A>Ideas such as some people say there are, it will not be substratum that 
<A NAME="301"></A>is substance; for these must be substances, but not predicable of a substratum; 
<A NAME="302"></A>for if they were they would exist only by being participated in.) <BR><BR>"Each 
<A NAME="303"></A>thing itself, then, and its essence are one and the same in no merely accidental 
<A NAME="304"></A>way, as is evident both from the preceding arguments and because to know 
<A NAME="305"></A>each thing, at least, is just to know its essence, so that even by the 
<A NAME="306"></A>exhibition of instances it becomes clear that both must be one. <BR><BR>"(But 
<A NAME="307"></A>of an accidental term, e.g.'the musical' or 'the white', since it has two 
<A NAME="308"></A>meanings, it is not true to say that it itself is identical with its essence; 
<A NAME="309"></A>for both that to which the accidental quality belongs, and the accidental 
<A NAME="310"></A>quality, are white, so that in a sense the accident and its essence are 
<A NAME="311"></A>the same, and in a sense they are not; for the essence of white is not 
<A NAME="312"></A>the same as the man or the white man, but it is the same as the attribute 
<A NAME="313"></A>white.) <BR><BR>"The absurdity of the separation would appear also if one 
<A NAME="314"></A>were to assign a name to each of the essences; for there would be yet another 
<A NAME="315"></A>essence besides the original one, e.g. to the essence of horse there will 
<A NAME="316"></A>belong a second essence. Yet why should not some things be their essences 
<A NAME="317"></A>from the start, since essence is substance? But indeed not only are a thing 
<A NAME="318"></A>and its essence one, but the formula of them is also the same, as is clear 
<A NAME="319"></A>even from what has been said; for it is not by accident that the essence 
<A NAME="320"></A>of one, and the one, are one. Further, if they are to be different, the 
<A NAME="321"></A>process will go on to infinity; for we shall have (1) the essence of one, 
<A NAME="322"></A>and (2) the one, so that to terms of the former kind the same argument 
<A NAME="323"></A>will be applicable. <BR><BR>"Clearly, then, each primary and self-subsistent 
<A NAME="324"></A>thing is one and the same as its essence. The sophistical objections to 
<A NAME="325"></A>this position, and the question whether Socrates and to be Socrates are 
<A NAME="326"></A>the same thing, are obviously answered by the same solution; for there 
<A NAME="327"></A>is no difference either in the standpoint from which the question would 
<A NAME="328"></A>be asked, or in that from which one could answer it successfully. We have 
<A NAME="329"></A>explained, then, in what sense each thing is the same as its essence and 
<A NAME="330"></A>in what sense it is not.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="331"></A><B>Part 7</B>
<A NAME="332"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="333"></A><BR><BR>"Of things that come to be, some come to be by nature, some by 
<A NAME="334"></A>art, some spontaneously. Now everything that comes to be comes to be by 
<A NAME="335"></A>the agency of something and from something and comes to be something. And 
<A NAME="336"></A>the something which I say it comes to be may be found in any category; 
<A NAME="337"></A>it may come to be either a 'this' or of some size or of some quality or 
<A NAME="338"></A>somewhere. <BR><BR>"Now natural comings to be are the comings to be of 
<A NAME="339"></A>those things which come to be by nature; and that out of which they come 
<A NAME="340"></A>to be is what we call matter; and that by which they come to be is something 
<A NAME="341"></A>which exists naturally; and the something which they come to be is a man 
<A NAME="342"></A>or a plant or one of the things of this kind, which we say are substances 
<A NAME="343"></A>if anything is-all things produced either by nature or by art have matter; 
<A NAME="344"></A>for each of them is capable both of being and of not being, and this capacity 
<A NAME="345"></A>is the matter in each-and, in general, both that from which they are produced 
<A NAME="346"></A>is nature, and the type according to which they are produced is nature 
<A NAME="347"></A>(for that which is produced, e.g. a plant or an animal, has a nature), 
<A NAME="348"></A>and so is that by which they are produced--the so-called 'formal' nature, 
<A NAME="349"></A>which is specifically the same (though this is in another individual); 
<A NAME="350"></A>for man begets man. <BR><BR>"Thus, then, are natural products produced; 
<A NAME="351"></A>all other productions are called 'makings'. And all makings proceed either 
<A NAME="352"></A>from art or from a faculty or from thought. Some of them happen also spontaneously 
<A NAME="353"></A>or by luck just as natural products sometimes do; for there also the same 
<A NAME="354"></A>things sometimes are produced without seed as well as from seed. Concerning 
<A NAME="355"></A>these cases, then, we must inquire later, but from art proceed the things 
<A NAME="356"></A>of which the form is in the soul of the artist. (By form I mean the essence 
<A NAME="357"></A>of each thing and its primary substance.) For even contraries have in a 
<A NAME="358"></A>sense the same form; for the substance of a privation is the opposite substance, 
<A NAME="359"></A>e.g. health is the substance of disease (for disease is the absence of 
<A NAME="360"></A>health); and health is the formula in the soul or the knowledge of it. 
<A NAME="361"></A>The healthy subject is produced as the result of the following train of 
<A NAME="362"></A>thought:-since this is health, if the subject is to be healthy this must 
<A NAME="363"></A>first be present, e.g. a uniform state of body, and if this is to be present, 
<A NAME="364"></A>there must be heat; and the physician goes on thinking thus until he reduces 
<A NAME="365"></A>the matter to a final something which he himself can produce. Then the 
<A NAME="366"></A>process from this point onward, i.e. the process towards health, is called 
<A NAME="367"></A>a 'making'. Therefore it follows that in a sense health comes from health 
<A NAME="368"></A>and house from house, that with matter from that without matter; for the 
<A NAME="369"></A>medical art and the building art are the form of health and of the house, 
<A NAME="370"></A>and when I speak of substance without matter I mean the essence. <BR><BR>"Of 
<A NAME="371"></A>the productions or processes one part is called thinking and the other 
<A NAME="372"></A>making,-that which proceeds from the starting-point and the form is thinking, 
<A NAME="373"></A>and that which proceeds from the final step of the thinking is making. 
<A NAME="374"></A>And each of the other, intermediate, things is produced in the same way. 
<A NAME="375"></A>I mean, for instance, if the subject is to be healthy his bodily state 
<A NAME="376"></A>must be made uniform. What then does being made uniform imply? This or 
<A NAME="377"></A>that. And this depends on his being made warm. What does this imply? Something 
<A NAME="378"></A>else. And this something is present potentially; and what is present potentially 
<A NAME="379"></A>is already in the physician's power. <BR><BR>"The active principle then 
<A NAME="380"></A>and the starting point for the process of becoming healthy is, if it happens 
<A NAME="381"></A>by art, the form in the soul, and if spontaneously, it is that, whatever 
<A NAME="382"></A>it is, which starts the making, for the man who makes by art, as in healing 
<A NAME="383"></A>the starting-point is perhaps the production of warmth (and this the physician 
<A NAME="384"></A>produces by rubbing). Warmth in the body, then, is either a part of health 
<A NAME="385"></A>or is followed (either directly or through several intermediate steps) 
<A NAME="386"></A>by something similar which is a part of health; and this, viz. that which 
<A NAME="387"></A>produces the part of health, is the limiting-point--and so too with a house 
<A NAME="388"></A>(the stones are the limiting-point here) and in all other cases. Therefore, 
<A NAME="389"></A>as the saying goes, it is impossible that anything should be produced if 
<A NAME="390"></A>there were nothing existing before. Obviously then some part of the result 
<A NAME="391"></A>will pre-exist of necessity; for the matter is a part; for this is present 
<A NAME="392"></A>in the process and it is this that becomes something. But is the matter 
<A NAME="393"></A>an element even in the formula? We certainly describe in both ways what 
<A NAME="394"></A>brazen circles are; we describe both the matter by saying it is brass, 
<A NAME="395"></A>and the form by saying that it is such and such a figure; and figure is 
<A NAME="396"></A>the proximate genus in which it is placed. The brazen circle, then, has 
<A NAME="397"></A>its matter in its formula. <BR><BR>"As for that out of which as matter 
<A NAME="398"></A>they are produced, some things are said, when they have been produced, 
<A NAME="399"></A>to be not that but 'thaten'; e.g. the statue is not gold but golden. And 
<A NAME="400"></A>a healthy man is not said to be that from which he has come. The reason 
<A NAME="401"></A>is that though a thing comes both from its privation and from its substratum, 
<A NAME="402"></A>which we call its matter (e.g. what becomes healthy is both a man and an 
<A NAME="403"></A>invalid), it is said to come rather from its privation (e.g. it is from 
<A NAME="404"></A>an invalid rather than from a man that a healthy subject is produced). 
<A NAME="405"></A>And so the healthy subject is not said to he an invalid, but to be a man, 
<A NAME="406"></A>and the man is said to be healthy. But as for the things whose privation 
<A NAME="407"></A>is obscure and nameless, e.g. in brass the privation of a particular shape 
<A NAME="408"></A>or in bricks and timber the privation of arrangement as a house, the thing 
<A NAME="409"></A>is thought to be produced from these materials, as in the former case the 
<A NAME="410"></A>healthy man is produced from an invalid. And so, as there also a thing 
<A NAME="411"></A>is not said to be that from which it comes, here the statue is not said 
<A NAME="412"></A>to be wood but is said by a verbal change to be wooden, not brass but brazen, 
<A NAME="413"></A>not gold but golden, and the house is said to be not bricks but bricken 
<A NAME="414"></A>(though we should not say without qualification, if we looked at the matter 
<A NAME="415"></A>carefully, even that a statue is produced from wood or a house from bricks, 
<A NAME="416"></A>because coming to be implies change in that from which a thing comes to 
<A NAME="417"></A>be, and not permanence). It is for this reason, then, that we use this 
<A NAME="418"></A>way of speaking.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="419"></A><B>Part 8</B>
<A NAME="420"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>"Since anything which is produced is produced by something (and 
<A NAME="422"></A>this I call the starting-point of the production), and from something (and 
<A NAME="423"></A>let this be taken to be not the privation but the matter; for the meaning 
<A NAME="424"></A>we attach to this has already been explained), and since something is produced 
<A NAME="425"></A>(and this is either a sphere or a circle or whatever else it may chance 
<A NAME="426"></A>to be), just as we do not make the substratum (the brass), so we do not 
<A NAME="427"></A>make the sphere, except incidentally, because the brazen sphere is a sphere 
<A NAME="428"></A>and we make the forme. For to make a 'this' is to make a 'this' out of 
<A NAME="429"></A>the substratum in the full sense of the word. (I mean that to make the 
<A NAME="430"></A>brass round is not to make the round or the sphere, but something else, 
<A NAME="431"></A>i.e. to produce this form in something different from itself. For if we 
<A NAME="432"></A>make the form, we must make it out of something else; for this was assumed. 
<A NAME="433"></A>E.g. we make a brazen sphere; and that in the sense that out of this, which 
<A NAME="434"></A>is brass, we make this other, which is a sphere.) If, then, we also make 
<A NAME="435"></A>the substratum itself, clearly we shall make it in the same way, and the 
<A NAME="436"></A>processes of making will regress to infinity. Obviously then the form also, 
<A NAME="437"></A>or whatever we ought to call the shape present in the sensible thing, is 
<A NAME="438"></A>not produced, nor is there any production of it, nor is the essence produced; 
<A NAME="439"></A>for this is that which is made to be in something else either by art or 
<A NAME="440"></A>by nature or by some faculty. But that there is a brazen sphere, this we 
<A NAME="441"></A>make. For we make it out of brass and the sphere; we bring the form into 
<A NAME="442"></A>this particular matter, and the result is a brazen sphere. But if the essence 
<A NAME="443"></A>of sphere in general is to be produced, something must be produced out 
<A NAME="444"></A>of something. For the product will always have to be divisible, and one 
<A NAME="445"></A>part must be this and another that; I mean the one must be matter and the 
<A NAME="446"></A>other form. If, then, a sphere is 'the figure whose circumference is at 
<A NAME="447"></A>all points equidistant from the centre', part of this will be the medium 
<A NAME="448"></A>in which the thing made will be, and part will be in that medium, and the 
<A NAME="449"></A>whole will be the thing produced, which corresponds to the brazen sphere. 
<A NAME="450"></A>It is obvious, then, from what has been said, that that which is spoken 
<A NAME="451"></A>of as form or substance is not produced, but the concrete thing which gets 
<A NAME="452"></A>its name from this is produced, and that in everything which is generated 
<A NAME="453"></A>matter is present, and one part of the thing is matter and the other form. 
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>"Is there, then, a sphere apart from the individual spheres or 
<A NAME="455"></A>a house apart from the bricks? Rather we may say that no 'this' would ever 
<A NAME="456"></A>have been coming to be, if this had been so, but that the 'form' means 
<A NAME="457"></A>the 'such', and is not a 'this'-a definite thing; but the artist makes, 
<A NAME="458"></A>or the father begets, a 'such' out of a 'this'; and when it has been begotten, 
<A NAME="459"></A>it is a 'this such'. And the whole 'this', Callias or Socrates, is analogous 
<A NAME="460"></A>to 'this brazen sphere', but man and animal to 'brazen sphere' in general. 
<A NAME="461"></A>Obviously, then, the cause which consists of the Forms (taken in the sense 
<A NAME="462"></A>in which some maintain the existence of the Forms, i.e. if they are something 
<A NAME="463"></A>apart from the individuals) is useless, at least with regard to comings-to-be 
<A NAME="464"></A>and to substances; and the Forms need not, for this reason at least, be 
<A NAME="465"></A>self-subsistent substances. In some cases indeed it is even obvious that 
<A NAME="466"></A>the begetter is of the same kind as the begotten (not, however, the same 
<A NAME="467"></A>nor one in number, but in form), i.e. in the case of natural products (for 
<A NAME="468"></A>man begets man), unless something happens contrary to nature, e.g. the 
<A NAME="469"></A>production of a mule by a horse. (And even these cases are similar; for 
<A NAME="470"></A>that which would be found to be common to horse and ass, the genus next 
<A NAME="471"></A>above them, has not received a name, but it would doubtless be both in 
<A NAME="472"></A>fact something like a mule.) Obviously, therefore, it is quite unnecessary 
<A NAME="473"></A>to set up a Form as a pattern (for we should have looked for Forms in these 
<A NAME="474"></A>cases if in any; for these are substances if anything is so); the begetter 
<A NAME="475"></A>is adequate to the making of the product and to the causing of the form 
<A NAME="476"></A>in the matter. And when we have the whole, such and such a form in this 
<A NAME="477"></A>flesh and in these bones, this is Callias or Socrates; and they are different 
<A NAME="478"></A>in virtue of their matter (for that is different), but the same in form; 
<A NAME="479"></A>for their form is indivisible.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="480"></A><B>Part 9</B>
<A NAME="481"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>"The question might be raised, why some things are produced spontaneously 
<A NAME="483"></A>as well as by art, e.g. health, while others are not, e.g. a house. The 
<A NAME="484"></A>reason is that in some cases the matter which governs the production in 
<A NAME="485"></A>the making and producing of any work of art, and in which a part of the 
<A NAME="486"></A>product is present,-some matter is such as to be set in motion by itself 
<A NAME="487"></A>and some is not of this nature, and of the former kind some can move itself 
<A NAME="488"></A>in the particular way required, while other matter is incapable of this; 
<A NAME="489"></A>for many things can be set in motion by themselves but not in some particular 
<A NAME="490"></A>way, e.g. that of dancing. The things, then, whose matter is of this sort, 
<A NAME="491"></A>e.g. stones, cannot be moved in the particular way required, except by 
<A NAME="492"></A>something else, but in another way they can move themselves-and so it is 
<A NAME="493"></A>with fire. Therefore some things will not exist apart from some one who 
<A NAME="494"></A>has the art of making them, while others will; for motion will be started 
<A NAME="495"></A>by these things which have not the art but can themselves be moved by other 
<A NAME="496"></A>things which have not the art or with a motion starting from a part of 
<A NAME="497"></A>the product. <BR><BR>"And it is clear also from what has been said that 
<A NAME="498"></A>in a sense every product of art is produced from a thing which shares its 
<A NAME="499"></A>name (as natural products are produced), or from a part of itself which 
<A NAME="500"></A>shares its name (e.g. the house is produced from a house, qua produced 
<A NAME="501"></A>by reason; for the art of building is the form of the house), or from something 
<A NAME="502"></A>which contains a art of it,-if we exclude things produced by accident; 
<A NAME="503"></A>for the cause of the thing's producing the product directly per se is a 
<A NAME="504"></A>part of the product. The heat in the movement caused heat in the body, 
<A NAME="505"></A>and this is either health, or a part of health, or is followed by a part 
<A NAME="506"></A>of health or by health itself. And so it is said to cause health, because 
<A NAME="507"></A>it causes that to which health attaches as a consequence. <BR><BR>"Therefore, 
<A NAME="508"></A>as in syllogisms, substance is the starting-point of everything. It is 
<A NAME="509"></A>from 'what a thing is' that syllogisms start; and from it also we now find 
<A NAME="510"></A>processes of production to start. <BR><BR>"Things which are formed by nature 
<A NAME="511"></A>are in the same case as these products of art. For the seed is productive 
<A NAME="512"></A>in the same way as the things that work by art; for it has the form potentially, 
<A NAME="513"></A>and that from which the seed comes has in a sense the same name as the 
<A NAME="514"></A>offspring only in a sense, for we must not expect parent and offspring 
<A NAME="515"></A>always to have exactly the same name, as in the production of 'human being' 
<A NAME="516"></A>from 'human' for a 'woman' also can be produced by a 'man'-unless the offspring 
<A NAME="517"></A>be an imperfect form; which is the reason why the parent of a mule is not 
<A NAME="518"></A>a mule. The natural things which (like the artificial objects previously 
<A NAME="519"></A>considered) can be produced spontaneously are those whose matter can be 
<A NAME="520"></A>moved even by itself in the way in which the seed usually moves it; those 
<A NAME="521"></A>things which have not such matter cannot be produced except from the parent 
<A NAME="522"></A>animals themselves. <BR><BR>"But not only regarding substance does our 
<A NAME="523"></A>argument prove that its form does not come to be, but the argument applies 
<A NAME="524"></A>to all the primary classes alike, i.e. quantity, quality, and the other 
<A NAME="525"></A>categories. For as the brazen sphere comes to be, but not the sphere nor 
<A NAME="526"></A>the brass, and so too in the case of brass itself, if it comes to be, it 
<A NAME="527"></A>is its concrete unity that comes to be (for the matter and the form must 
<A NAME="528"></A>always exist before), so is it both in the case of substance and in that 
<A NAME="529"></A>of quality and quantity and the other categories likewise; for the quality 
<A NAME="530"></A>does not come to be, but the wood of that quality, and the quantity does 
<A NAME="531"></A>not come to be, but the wood or the animal of that size. But we may learn 
<A NAME="532"></A>from these instances a peculiarity of substance, that there must exist 
<A NAME="533"></A>beforehand in complete reality another substance which produces it, e.g. 
<A NAME="534"></A>an animal if an animal is produced; but it is not necessary that a quality 
<A NAME="535"></A>or quantity should pre-exist otherwise than potentially.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="536"></A><B>Part 10</B>
<A NAME="537"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="538"></A><BR><BR>"Since a definition is a formula, and every formula has parts, 
<A NAME="539"></A>and as the formula is to the thing, so is the part of the formula to the 
<A NAME="540"></A>part of the thing, the question is already being asked whether the formula 
<A NAME="541"></A>of the parts must be present in the formula of the whole or not. For in 
<A NAME="542"></A>some cases the formulae of the parts are seen to be present, and in some 
<A NAME="543"></A>not. The formula of the circle does not include that of the segments, but 
<A NAME="544"></A>that of the syllable includes that of the letters; yet the circle is divided 
<A NAME="545"></A>into segments as the syllable is into letters.-And further if the parts 
<A NAME="546"></A>are prior to the whole, and the acute angle is a part of the right angle 
<A NAME="547"></A>and the finger a part of the animal, the acute angle will be prior to the 
<A NAME="548"></A>right angle and finger to the man. But the latter are thought to be prior; 
<A NAME="549"></A>for in formula the parts are explained by reference to them, and in respect 
<A NAME="550"></A>also of the power of existing apart from each other the wholes are prior 
<A NAME="551"></A>to the parts. <BR><BR>"Perhaps we should rather say that 'part' is used 
<A NAME="552"></A>in several senses. One of these is 'that which measures another thing in 
<A NAME="553"></A>respect of quantity'. But let this sense be set aside; let us inquire about 
<A NAME="554"></A>the parts of which substance consists. If then matter is one thing, form 
<A NAME="555"></A>another, the compound of these a third, and both the matter and the form 
<A NAME="556"></A>and the compound are substance even the matter is in a sense called part 
<A NAME="557"></A>of a thing, while in a sense it is not, but only the elements of which 
<A NAME="558"></A>the formula of the form consists. E.g. of concavity flesh (for this is 
<A NAME="559"></A>the matter in which it is produced) is not a part, but of snubness it is 
<A NAME="560"></A>a part; and the bronze is a part of the concrete statue, but not of the 
<A NAME="561"></A>statue when this is spoken of in the sense of the form. (For the form, 
<A NAME="562"></A>or the thing as having form, should be said to be the thing, but the material 
<A NAME="563"></A>element by itself must never be said to be so.) And so the formula of the 
<A NAME="564"></A>circle does not include that of the segments, but the formula of the syllable 
<A NAME="565"></A>includes that of the letters; for the letters are parts of the formula 
<A NAME="566"></A>of the form, and not matter, but the segments are parts in the sense of 
<A NAME="567"></A>matter on which the form supervenes; yet they are nearer the form than 
<A NAME="568"></A>the bronze is when roundness is produced in bronze. But in a sense not 
<A NAME="569"></A>even every kind of letter will be present in the formula of the syllable, 
<A NAME="570"></A>e.g. particular waxen letters or the letters as movements in the air; for 
<A NAME="571"></A>in these also we have already something that is part of the syllable only 
<A NAME="572"></A>in the sense that it is its perceptible matter. For even if the line when 
<A NAME="573"></A>divided passes away into its halves, or the man into bones and muscles 
<A NAME="574"></A>and flesh, it does not follow that they are composed of these as parts 
<A NAME="575"></A>of their essence, but rather as matter; and these are parts of the concrete 
<A NAME="576"></A>thing, but not also of the form, i.e. of that to which the formula refers; 
<A NAME="577"></A>wherefore also they are not present in the formulae. In one kind of formula, 
<A NAME="578"></A>then, the formula of such parts will be present, but in another it must 
<A NAME="579"></A>not be present, where the formula does not refer to the concrete object. 
<A NAME="580"></A>For it is for this reason that some things have as their constituent principles 
<A NAME="581"></A>parts into which they pass away, while some have not. Those things which 
<A NAME="582"></A>are the form and the matter taken together, e.g. the snub, or the bronze 
<A NAME="583"></A>circle, pass away into these materials, and the matter is a part of them; 
<A NAME="584"></A>but those things which do not involve matter but are without matter, and 
<A NAME="585"></A>whose formulae are formulae of the form only, do not pass away,-either 
<A NAME="586"></A>not at all or at any rate not in this way. Therefore these materials are 
<A NAME="587"></A>principles and parts of the concrete things, while of the form they are 
<A NAME="588"></A>neither parts nor principles. And therefore the clay statue is resolved 
<A NAME="589"></A>into clay and the ball into bronze and Callias into flesh and bones, and 
<A NAME="590"></A>again the circle into its segments; for there is a sense of 'circle' in 
<A NAME="591"></A>which involves matter. For 'circle' is used ambiguously, meaning both the 
<A NAME="592"></A>circle, unqualified, and the individual circle, because there is no name 
<A NAME="593"></A>peculiar to the individuals. <BR><BR>"The truth has indeed now been stated, 
<A NAME="594"></A>but still let us state it yet more clearly, taking up the question again. 
<A NAME="595"></A>The parts of the formula, into which the formula is divided, are prior 
<A NAME="596"></A>to it, either all or some of them. The formula of the right angle, however, 
<A NAME="597"></A>does not include the formula of the acute, but the formula of the acute 
<A NAME="598"></A>includes that of the right angle; for he who defines the acute uses the 
<A NAME="599"></A>right angle; for the acute is 'less than a right angle'. The circle and 
<A NAME="600"></A>the semicircle also are in a like relation; for the semicircle is defined 
<A NAME="601"></A>by the circle; and so is the finger by the whole body, for a finger is 
<A NAME="602"></A>'such and such a part of a man'. Therefore the parts which are of the nature 
<A NAME="603"></A>of matter, and into which as its matter a thing is divided, are posterior; 
<A NAME="604"></A>but those which are of the nature of parts of the formula, and of the substance 
<A NAME="605"></A>according to its formula, are prior, either all or some of them. And since 
<A NAME="606"></A>the soul of animals (for this is the substance of a living being) is their 
<A NAME="607"></A>substance according to the formula, i.e. the form and the essence of a 
<A NAME="608"></A>body of a certain kind (at least we shall define each part, if we define 
<A NAME="609"></A>it well, not without reference to its function, and this cannot belong 
<A NAME="610"></A>to it without perception), so that the parts of soul are prior, either 
<A NAME="611"></A>all or some of them, to the concrete 'animal', and so too with each individual 
<A NAME="612"></A>animal; and the body and parts are posterior to this, the essential substance, 
<A NAME="613"></A>and it is not the substance but the concrete thing that is divided into 
<A NAME="614"></A>these parts as its matter:-this being so, to the concrete thing these are 
<A NAME="615"></A>in a sense prior, but in a sense they are not. For they cannot even exist 
<A NAME="616"></A>if severed from the whole; for it is not a finger in any and every state 
<A NAME="617"></A>that is the finger of a living thing, but a dead finger is a finger only 
<A NAME="618"></A>in name. Some parts are neither prior nor posterior to the whole, i.e. 
<A NAME="619"></A>those which are dominant and in which the formula, i.e. the essential substance, 
<A NAME="620"></A>is immediately present, e.g. perhaps the heart or the brain; for it does 
<A NAME="621"></A>not matter in the least which of the two has this quality. But man and 
<A NAME="622"></A>horse and terms which are thus applied to individuals, but universally, 
<A NAME="623"></A>are not substance but something composed of this particular formula and 
<A NAME="624"></A>this particular matter treated as universal; and as regards the individual, 
<A NAME="625"></A>Socrates already includes in him ultimate individual matter; and similarly 
<A NAME="626"></A>in all other cases. 'A part' may be a part either of the form (i.e. of 
<A NAME="627"></A>the essence), or of the compound of the form and the matter, or of the 
<A NAME="628"></A>matter itself. But only the parts of the form are parts of the formula, 
<A NAME="629"></A>and the formula is of the universal; for 'being a circle' is the same as 
<A NAME="630"></A>the circle, and 'being a soul' the same as the soul. But when we come to 
<A NAME="631"></A>the concrete thing, e.g. this circle, i.e. one of the individual circles, 
<A NAME="632"></A>whether perceptible or intelligible (I mean by intelligible circles the 
<A NAME="633"></A>mathematical, and by perceptible circles those of bronze and of wood),-of 
<A NAME="634"></A>these there is no definition, but they are known by the aid of intuitive 
<A NAME="635"></A>thinking or of perception; and when they pass out of this complete realization 
<A NAME="636"></A>it is not clear whether they exist or not; but they are always stated and 
<A NAME="637"></A>recognized by means of the universal formula. But matter is unknowable 
<A NAME="638"></A>in itself. And some matter is perceptible and some intelligible, perceptible 
<A NAME="639"></A>matter being for instance bronze and wood and all matter that is changeable, 
<A NAME="640"></A>and intelligible matter being that which is present in perceptible things 
<A NAME="641"></A>not qua perceptible, i.e. the objects of mathematics. <BR><BR>"We have 
<A NAME="642"></A>stated, then, how matters stand with regard to whole and part, and their 
<A NAME="643"></A>priority and posteriority. But when any one asks whether the right angle 
<A NAME="644"></A>and the circle and the animal are prior, or the things into which they 
<A NAME="645"></A>are divided and of which they consist, i.e. the parts, we must meet the 
<A NAME="646"></A>inquiry by saying that the question cannot be answered simply. For if even 
<A NAME="647"></A>bare soul is the animal or the living thing, or the soul of each individual 
<A NAME="648"></A>is the individual itself, and 'being a circle' is the circle, and 'being 
<A NAME="649"></A>a right angle' and the essence of the right angle is the right angle, then 
<A NAME="650"></A>the whole in one sense must be called posterior to the art in one sense, 
<A NAME="651"></A>i.e. to the parts included in the formula and to the parts of the individual 
<A NAME="652"></A>right angle (for both the material right angle which is made of bronze, 
<A NAME="653"></A>and that which is formed by individual lines, are posterior to their parts); 
<A NAME="654"></A>while the immaterial right angle is posterior to the parts included in 
<A NAME="655"></A>the formula, but prior to those included in the particular instance, and 
<A NAME="656"></A>the question must not be answered simply. If, however, the soul is something 
<A NAME="657"></A>different and is not identical with the animal, even so some parts must, 
<A NAME="658"></A>as we have maintained, be called prior and others must 
<A NAME="659"></A>not.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="660"></A><B>Part 11</B>
<A NAME="661"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="662"></A><BR><BR>"Another question is naturally raised, viz. what sort of parts 
<A NAME="663"></A>belong to the form and what sort not to the form, but to the concrete thing. 
<A NAME="664"></A>Yet if this is not plain it is not possible to define any thing; for definition 
<A NAME="665"></A>is of the universal and of the form. If then it is not evident what sort 
<A NAME="666"></A>of parts are of the nature of matter and what sort are not, neither will 
<A NAME="667"></A>the formula of the thing be evident. In the case of things which are found 
<A NAME="668"></A>to occur in specifically different materials, as a circle may exist in 
<A NAME="669"></A>bronze or stone or wood, it seems plain that these, the bronze or the stone, 
<A NAME="670"></A>are no part of the essence of the circle, since it is found apart from 
<A NAME="671"></A>them. Of things which are not seen to exist apart, there is no reason why 
<A NAME="672"></A>the same may not be true, just as if all circles that had ever been seen 
<A NAME="673"></A>were of bronze; for none the less the bronze would be no part of the form; 
<A NAME="674"></A>but it is hard to eliminate it in thought. E.g. the form of man is always 
<A NAME="675"></A>found in flesh and bones and parts of this kind; are these then also parts 
<A NAME="676"></A>of the form and the formula? No, they are matter; but because man is not 
<A NAME="677"></A>found also in other matters we are unable to perform the abstraction. <BR><BR>"Since 
<A NAME="678"></A>this is thought to be possible, but it is not clear when it is the case, 
<A NAME="679"></A>some people already raise the question even in the case of the circle and 
<A NAME="680"></A>the triangle, thinking that it is not right to define these by reference 
<A NAME="681"></A>to lines and to the continuous, but that all these are to the circle or 
<A NAME="682"></A>the triangle as flesh and bones are to man, and bronze or stone to the 
<A NAME="683"></A>statue; and they reduce all things to numbers, and they say the formula 
<A NAME="684"></A>of 'line' is that of 'two'. And of those who assert the Ideas some make 
<A NAME="685"></A>'two' the line-itself, and others make it the Form of the line; for in 
<A NAME="686"></A>some cases they say the Form and that of which it is the Form are the same, 
<A NAME="687"></A>e.g. 'two' and the Form of two; but in the case of 'line' they say this 
<A NAME="688"></A>is no longer so. <BR><BR>"It follows then that there is one Form for many 
<A NAME="689"></A>things whose form is evidently different (a conclusion which confronted 
<A NAME="690"></A>the Pythagoreans also); and it is possible to make one thing the Form-itself 
<A NAME="691"></A>of all, and to hold that the others are not Forms; but thus all things 
<A NAME="692"></A>will be one. <BR><BR>"We have pointed out, then, that the question of definitions 
<A NAME="693"></A>contains some difficulty, and why this is so. And so to reduce all things 
<A NAME="694"></A>thus to Forms and to eliminate the matter is useless labour; for some things 
<A NAME="695"></A>surely are a particular form in a particular matter, or particular things 
<A NAME="696"></A>in a particular state. And the comparison which Socrates the younger used 
<A NAME="697"></A>to make in the case of 'animal' is not sound; for it leads away from the 
<A NAME="698"></A>truth, and makes one suppose that man can possibly exist without his parts, 
<A NAME="699"></A>as the circle can without the bronze. But the case is not similar; for 
<A NAME="700"></A>an animal is something perceptible, and it is not possible to define it 
<A NAME="701"></A>without reference to movement-nor, therefore, without reference to the 
<A NAME="702"></A>parts' being in a certain state. For it is not a hand in any and every 
<A NAME="703"></A>state that is a part of man, but only when it can fulfil its work, and 
<A NAME="704"></A>therefore only when it is alive; if it is not alive it is not a part. <BR><BR>"Regarding 
<A NAME="705"></A>the objects of mathematics, why are the formulae of the parts not parts 
<A NAME="706"></A>of the formulae of the wholes; e.g. why are not the semicircles included 
<A NAME="707"></A>in the formula of the circle? It cannot be said, 'because these parts are 
<A NAME="708"></A>perceptible things'; for they are not. But perhaps this makes no difference; 
<A NAME="709"></A>for even some things which are not perceptible must have matter; indeed 
<A NAME="710"></A>there is some matter in everything which is not an essence and a bare form 
<A NAME="711"></A>but a 'this'. The semicircles, then, will not be parts of the universal 
<A NAME="712"></A>circle, but will be parts of the individual circles, as has been said before; 
<A NAME="713"></A>for while one kind of matter is perceptible, there is another which is 
<A NAME="714"></A>intelligible. <BR><BR>"It is clear also that the soul is the primary substance 
<A NAME="715"></A>and the body is matter, and man or animal is the compound of both taken 
<A NAME="716"></A>universally; and 'Socrates' or 'Coriscus', if even the soul of Socrates 
<A NAME="717"></A>may be called Socrates, has two meanings (for some mean by such a term 
<A NAME="718"></A>the soul, and others mean the concrete thing), but if 'Socrates' or 'Coriscus' 
<A NAME="719"></A>means simply this particular soul and this particular body, the individual 
<A NAME="720"></A>is analogous to the universal in its composition. <BR><BR>"Whether there 
<A NAME="721"></A>is, apart from the matter of such substances, another kind of matter, and 
<A NAME="722"></A>one should look for some substance other than these, e.g. numbers or something 
<A NAME="723"></A>of the sort, must be considered later. For it is for the sake of this that 
<A NAME="724"></A>we are trying to determine the nature of perceptible substances as well, 
<A NAME="725"></A>since in a sense the inquiry about perceptible substances is the work of 
<A NAME="726"></A>physics, i.e. of second philosophy; for the physicist must come to know 
<A NAME="727"></A>not only about the matter, but also about the substance expressed in the 
<A NAME="728"></A>formula, and even more than about the other. And in the case of definitions, 
<A NAME="729"></A>how the elements in the formula are parts of the definition, and why the 
<A NAME="730"></A>definition is one formula (for clearly the thing is one, but in virtue 
<A NAME="731"></A>of what is the thing one, although it has parts?),-this must be considered 
<A NAME="732"></A>later. <BR><BR>"What the essence is and in what sense it is independent, 
<A NAME="733"></A>has been stated universally in a way which is true of every case, and also 
<A NAME="734"></A>why the formula of the essence of some things contains the parts of the 
<A NAME="735"></A>thing defined, while that of others does not. And we have stated that in 
<A NAME="736"></A>the formula of the substance the material parts will not be present (for 
<A NAME="737"></A>they are not even parts of the substance in that sense, but of the concrete 
<A NAME="738"></A>substance; but of this there is in a sense a formula, and in a sense there 
<A NAME="739"></A>is not; for there is no formula of it with its matter, for this is indefinite, 
<A NAME="740"></A>but there is a formula of it with reference to its primary substance-e.g. 
<A NAME="741"></A>in the case of man the formula of the soul-, for the substance is the indwelling 
<A NAME="742"></A>form, from which and the matter the so-called concrete substance is derived; 
<A NAME="743"></A>e.g. concavity is a form of this sort, for from this and the nose arise 
<A NAME="744"></A>'snub nose' and 'snubness'); but in the concrete substance, e.g. a snub 
<A NAME="745"></A>nose or Callias, the matter also will be present. And we have stated that 
<A NAME="746"></A>the essence and the thing itself are in some cases the same; ie. in the 
<A NAME="747"></A>case of primary substances, e.g. curvature and the essence of curvature 
<A NAME="748"></A>if this is primary. (By a 'primary' substance I mean one which does not 
<A NAME="749"></A>imply the presence of something in something else, i.e. in something that 
<A NAME="750"></A>underlies it which acts as matter.) But things which are of the nature 
<A NAME="751"></A>of matter, or of wholes that include matter, are not the same as their 
<A NAME="752"></A>essences, nor are accidental unities like that of 'Socrates' and 'musical'; 
<A NAME="753"></A>for these are the same only by accident.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="754"></A><B>Part 12</B>
<A NAME="755"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="756"></A><BR><BR>"Now let us treat first of definition, in so far as we have not 
<A NAME="757"></A>treated of it in the Analytics; for the problem stated in them is useful 
<A NAME="758"></A>for our inquiries concerning substance. I mean this problem:-wherein can 
<A NAME="759"></A>consist the unity of that, the formula of which we call a definition, as 
<A NAME="760"></A>for instance, in the case of man, 'two-footed animal'; for let this be 
<A NAME="761"></A>the formula of man. Why, then, is this one, and not many, viz. 'animal' 
<A NAME="762"></A>and 'two-footed'? For in the case of 'man' and 'pale' there is a plurality 
<A NAME="763"></A>when one term does not belong to the other, but a unity when it does belong 
<A NAME="764"></A>and the subject, man, has a certain attribute; for then a unity is produced 
<A NAME="765"></A>and we have 'the pale man'. In the present case, on the other hand, one 
<A NAME="766"></A>does not share in the other; the genus is not thought to share in its differentiae 
<A NAME="767"></A>(for then the same thing would share in contraries; for the differentiae 
<A NAME="768"></A>by which the genus is divided are contrary). And even if the genus does 
<A NAME="769"></A>share in them, the same argument applies, since the differentiae present 
<A NAME="770"></A>in man are many, e.g. endowed with feet, two-footed, featherless. Why are 
<A NAME="771"></A>these one and not many? Not because they are present in one thing; for 
<A NAME="772"></A>on this principle a unity can be made out of all the attributes of a thing. 
<A NAME="773"></A>But surely all the attributes in the definition must be one; for the definition 
<A NAME="774"></A>is a single formula and a formula of substance, so that it must be a formula 
<A NAME="775"></A>of some one thing; for substance means a 'one' and a 'this', as we maintain. 
<A NAME="776"></A><BR><BR>"We must first inquire about definitions reached by the method 
<A NAME="777"></A>of divisions. There is nothing in the definition except the first-named 
<A NAME="778"></A>and the differentiae. The other genera are the first genus and along with 
<A NAME="779"></A>this the differentiae that are taken with it, e.g. the first may be 'animal', 
<A NAME="780"></A>the next 'animal which is two-footed', and again 'animal which is two-footed 
<A NAME="781"></A>and featherless', and similarly if the definition includes more terms. 
<A NAME="782"></A>And in general it makes no difference whether it includes many or few terms,-nor, 
<A NAME="783"></A>therefore, whether it includes few or simply two; and of the two the one 
<A NAME="784"></A>is differentia and the other genus; e.g. in 'two-footed animal' 'animal' 
<A NAME="785"></A>is genus, and the other is differentia. <BR><BR>"If then the genus absolutely 
<A NAME="786"></A>does not exist apart from the species-of-a-genus, or if it exists but exists 
<A NAME="787"></A>as matter (for the voice is genus and matter, but its differentiae make 
<A NAME="788"></A>the species, i.e. the letters, out of it), clearly the definition is the 
<A NAME="789"></A>formula which comprises the differentiae. <BR><BR>"But it is also necessary 
<A NAME="790"></A>that the division be by the differentia of the diferentia; e.g. 'endowed 
<A NAME="791"></A>with feet' is a differentia of 'animal'; again the differentia of 'animal 
<A NAME="792"></A>endowed with feet' must be of it qua endowed with feet. Therefore we must 
<A NAME="793"></A>not say, if we are to speak rightly, that of that which is endowed with 
<A NAME="794"></A>feet one part has feathers and one is featherless (if we do this we do 
<A NAME="795"></A>it through incapacity); we must divide it only into cloven-footed and not 
<A NAME="796"></A>cloven; for these are differentiae in the foot; cloven-footedness is a 
<A NAME="797"></A>form of footedness. And the process wants always to go on so till it reaches 
<A NAME="798"></A>the species that contain no differences. And then there will be as many 
<A NAME="799"></A>kinds of foot as there are differentiae, and the kinds of animals endowed 
<A NAME="800"></A>with feet will be equal in number to the differentiae. If then this is 
<A NAME="801"></A>so, clearly the last differentia will be the substance of the thing and 
<A NAME="802"></A>its definition, since it is not right to state the same things more than 
<A NAME="803"></A>once in our definitions; for it is superfluous. And this does happen; for 
<A NAME="804"></A>when we say 'animal endowed with feet and two-footed' we have said nothing 
<A NAME="805"></A>other than 'animal having feet, having two feet'; and if we divide this 
<A NAME="806"></A>by the proper division, we shall be saying the same thing more than once-as 
<A NAME="807"></A>many times as there are differentiae. <BR><BR>"If then a differentia of 
<A NAME="808"></A>a differentia be taken at each step, one differentia-the last-will be the 
<A NAME="809"></A>form and the substance; but if we divide according to accidental qualities, 
<A NAME="810"></A>e.g. if we were to divide that which is endowed with feet into the white 
<A NAME="811"></A>and the black, there will be as many differentiae as there are cuts. Therefore 
<A NAME="812"></A>it is plain that the definition is the formula which contains the differentiae, 
<A NAME="813"></A>or, according to the right method, the last of these. This would be evident, 
<A NAME="814"></A>if we were to change the order of such definitions, e.g. of that of man, 
<A NAME="815"></A>saying 'animal which is two-footed and endowed with feet'; for 'endowed 
<A NAME="816"></A>with feet' is superfluous when 'two-footed' has been said. But there is 
<A NAME="817"></A>no order in the substance; for how are we to think the one element posterior 
<A NAME="818"></A>and the other prior? Regarding the definitions, then, which are reached 
<A NAME="819"></A>by the method of divisions, let this suffice as our first attempt at stating 
<A NAME="820"></A>their nature.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="821"></A><B>Part 13</B>
<A NAME="822"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="823"></A><BR><BR>"Let us return to the subject of our inquiry, which is substance. 
<A NAME="824"></A>As the substratum and the essence and the compound of these are called 
<A NAME="825"></A>substance, so also is the universal. About two of these we have spoken; 
<A NAME="826"></A>both about the essence and about the substratum, of which we have said 
<A NAME="827"></A>that it underlies in two senses, either being a 'this'-which is the way 
<A NAME="828"></A>in which an animal underlies its attributes-or as the matter underlies 
<A NAME="829"></A>the complete reality. The universal also is thought by some to be in the 
<A NAME="830"></A>fullest sense a cause, and a principle; therefore let us attack the discussion 
<A NAME="831"></A>of this point also. For it seems impossible that any universal term should 
<A NAME="832"></A>be the name of a substance. For firstly the substance of each thing is 
<A NAME="833"></A>that which is peculiar to it, which does not belong to anything else; but 
<A NAME="834"></A>the universal is common, since that is called universal which is such as 
<A NAME="835"></A>to belong to more than one thing. Of which individual then will this be 
<A NAME="836"></A>the substance? Either of all or of none; but it cannot be the substance 
<A NAME="837"></A>of all. And if it is to be the substance of one, this one will be the others 
<A NAME="838"></A>also; for things whose substance is one and whose essence is one are themselves 
<A NAME="839"></A>also one. <BR><BR>"Further, substance means that which is not predicable 
<A NAME="840"></A>of a subject, but the universal is predicable of some subject always. <BR><BR>"But 
<A NAME="841"></A>perhaps the universal, while it cannot be substance in the way in which 
<A NAME="842"></A>the essence is so, can be present in this; e.g. 'animal' can be present 
<A NAME="843"></A>in 'man' and 'horse'. Then clearly it is a formula of the essence. And 
<A NAME="844"></A>it makes no difference even if it is not a formula of everything that is 
<A NAME="845"></A>in the substance; for none the less the universal will be the substance 
<A NAME="846"></A>of something, as 'man' is the substance of the individual man in whom it 
<A NAME="847"></A>is present, so that the same result will follow once more; for the universal, 
<A NAME="848"></A>e.g. 'animal', will be the substance of that in which it is present as 
<A NAME="849"></A>something peculiar to it. And further it is impossible and absurd that 
<A NAME="850"></A>the 'this', i.e. the substance, if it consists of parts, should not consist 
<A NAME="851"></A>of substances nor of what is a 'this', but of quality; for that which is 
<A NAME="852"></A>not substance, i.e. the quality, will then be prior to substance and to 
<A NAME="853"></A>the 'this'. Which is impossible; for neither in formula nor in time nor 
<A NAME="854"></A>in coming to be can the modifications be prior to the substance; for then 
<A NAME="855"></A>they will also be separable from it. Further, Socrates will contain a substance 
<A NAME="856"></A>present in a substance, so that this will be the substance of two things. 
<A NAME="857"></A>And in general it follows, if man and such things are substance, that none 
<A NAME="858"></A>of the elements in their formulae is the substance of anything, nor does 
<A NAME="859"></A>it exist apart from the species or in anything else; I mean, for instance, 
<A NAME="860"></A>that no 'animal' exists apart from the particular kinds of animal, nor 
<A NAME="861"></A>does any other of the elements present in formulae exist apart. <BR><BR>"If, 
<A NAME="862"></A>then, we view the matter from these standpoints, it is plain that no universal 
<A NAME="863"></A>attribute is a substance, and this is plain also from the fact that no 
<A NAME="864"></A>common predicate indicates a 'this', but rather a 'such'. If not, many 
<A NAME="865"></A>difficulties follow and especially the 'third man'. <BR><BR>"The conclusion 
<A NAME="866"></A>is evident also from the following consideration. A substance cannot consist 
<A NAME="867"></A>of substances present in it in complete reality; for things that are thus 
<A NAME="868"></A>in complete reality two are never in complete reality one, though if they 
<A NAME="869"></A>are potentially two, they can be one (e.g. the double line consists of 
<A NAME="870"></A>two halves-potentially; for the complete realization of the halves divides 
<A NAME="871"></A>them from one another); therefore if the substance is one, it will not 
<A NAME="872"></A>consist of substances present in it and present in this way, which Democritus 
<A NAME="873"></A>describes rightly; he says one thing cannot be made out of two nor two 
<A NAME="874"></A>out of one; for he identifies substances with his indivisible magnitudes. 
<A NAME="875"></A>It is clear therefore that the same will hold good of number, if number 
<A NAME="876"></A>is a synthesis of units, as is said by some; for two is either not one, 
<A NAME="877"></A>or there is no unit present in it in complete reality. But our result involves 
<A NAME="878"></A>a difficulty. If no substance can consist of universals because a universal 
<A NAME="879"></A>indicates a 'such', not a 'this', and if no substance can be composed of 
<A NAME="880"></A>substances existing in complete reality, every substance would be incomposite, 
<A NAME="881"></A>so that there would not even be a formula of any substance. But it is thought 
<A NAME="882"></A>by all and was stated long ago that it is either only, or primarily, substance 
<A NAME="883"></A>that can defined; yet now it seems that not even substance can. There cannot, 
<A NAME="884"></A>then, be a definition of anything; or in a sense there can be, and in a 
<A NAME="885"></A>sense there cannot. And what we are saying will be plainer from what 
<A NAME="886"></A>follows.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="887"></A><B>Part 14</B>
<A NAME="888"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="889"></A><BR><BR>"It is clear also from these very facts what consequence confronts 
<A NAME="890"></A>those who say the Ideas are substances capable of separate existence, and 
<A NAME="891"></A>at the same time make the Form consist of the genus and the differentiae. 
<A NAME="892"></A>For if the Forms exist and 'animal' is present in 'man' and 'horse', it 
<A NAME="893"></A>is either one and the same in number, or different. (In formula it is clearly 
<A NAME="894"></A>one; for he who states the formula will go through the formula in either 
<A NAME="895"></A>case.) If then there is a 'man-in-himself' who is a 'this' and exists apart, 
<A NAME="896"></A>the parts also of which he consists, e.g. 'animal' and 'two-footed', must 
<A NAME="897"></A>indicate 'thises', and be capable of separate existence, and substances; 
<A NAME="898"></A>therefore 'animal', as well as 'man', must be of this sort. <BR><BR>"Now 
<A NAME="899"></A>(1) if the 'animal' in 'the horse' and in 'man' is one and the same, as 
<A NAME="900"></A>you are with yourself, (a) how will the one in things that exist apart 
<A NAME="901"></A>be one, and how will this 'animal' escape being divided even from itself? 
<A NAME="902"></A><BR><BR>"Further, (b) if it is to share in 'two-footed' and 'many-footed', 
<A NAME="903"></A>an impossible conclusion follows; for contrary attributes will belong at 
<A NAME="904"></A>the same time to it although it is one and a 'this'. If it is not to share 
<A NAME="905"></A>in them, what is the relation implied when one says the animal is two-footed 
<A NAME="906"></A>or possessed of feet? But perhaps the two things are 'put together' and 
<A NAME="907"></A>are 'in contact', or are 'mixed'. Yet all these expressions are absurd. 
<A NAME="908"></A><BR><BR>"But (2) suppose the Form to be different in each species. Then 
<A NAME="909"></A>there will be practically an infinite number of things whose substance 
<A NAME="910"></A>is animal'; for it is not by accident that 'man' has 'animal' for one of 
<A NAME="911"></A>its elements. Further, many things will be 'animal-itself'. For (i) the 
<A NAME="912"></A>'animal' in each species will be the substance of the species; for it is 
<A NAME="913"></A>after nothing else that the species is called; if it were, that other would 
<A NAME="914"></A>be an element in 'man', i.e. would be the genus of man. And further, (ii) 
<A NAME="915"></A>all the elements of which 'man' is composed will be Ideas. None of them, 
<A NAME="916"></A>then, will be the Idea of one thing and the substance of another; this 
<A NAME="917"></A>is impossible. The 'animal', then, present in each species of animals will 
<A NAME="918"></A>be animal-itself. Further, from what is this 'animal' in each species derived, 
<A NAME="919"></A>and how will it be derived from animal-itself? Or how can this 'animal', 
<A NAME="920"></A>whose essence is simply animality, exist apart from animal-itself? <BR><BR>"Further, 
<A NAME="921"></A>(3)in the case of sensible things both these consequences and others still 
<A NAME="922"></A>more absurd follow. If, then, these consequences are impossible, clearly 
<A NAME="923"></A>there are not Forms of sensible things in the sense in which some maintain 
<A NAME="924"></A>their existence.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="925"></A><B>Part 15</B>
<A NAME="926"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="927"></A><BR><BR>"Since substance is of two kinds, the concrete thing and the formula 
<A NAME="928"></A>(I mean that one kind of substance is the formula taken with the matter, 
<A NAME="929"></A>while another kind is the formula in its generality), substances in the 
<A NAME="930"></A>former sense are capable of destruction (for they are capable also of generation), 
<A NAME="931"></A>but there is no destruction of the formula in the sense that it is ever 
<A NAME="932"></A>in course of being destroyed (for there is no generation of it either; 
<A NAME="933"></A>the being of house is not generated, but only the being of this house), 
<A NAME="934"></A>but without generation and destruction formulae are and are not; for it 
<A NAME="935"></A>has been shown that no one begets nor makes these. For this reason, also, 
<A NAME="936"></A>there is neither definition of nor demonstration about sensible individual 
<A NAME="937"></A>substances, because they have matter whose nature is such that they are 
<A NAME="938"></A>capable both of being and of not being; for which reason all the individual 
<A NAME="939"></A>instances of them are destructible. If then demonstration is of necessary 
<A NAME="940"></A>truths and definition is a scientific process, and if, just as knowledge 
<A NAME="941"></A>cannot be sometimes knowledge and sometimes ignorance, but the state which 
<A NAME="942"></A>varies thus is opinion, so too demonstration and definition cannot vary 
<A NAME="943"></A>thus, but it is opinion that deals with that which can be otherwise than 
<A NAME="944"></A>as it is, clearly there can neither be definition of nor demonstration 
<A NAME="945"></A>about sensible individuals. For perishing things are obscure to those who 
<A NAME="946"></A>have the relevant knowledge, when they have passed from our perception; 
<A NAME="947"></A>and though the formulae remain in the soul unchanged, there will no longer 
<A NAME="948"></A>be either definition or demonstration. And so when one of the definition-mongers 
<A NAME="949"></A>defines any individual, he must recognize that his definition may always 
<A NAME="950"></A>be overthrown; for it is not possible to define such things. <BR><BR>"Nor 
<A NAME="951"></A>is it possible to define any Idea. For the Idea is, as its supporters say, 
<A NAME="952"></A>an individual, and can exist apart; and the formula must consist of words; 
<A NAME="953"></A>and he who defines must not invent a word (for it would be unknown), but 
<A NAME="954"></A>the established words are common to all the members of a class; these then 
<A NAME="955"></A>must apply to something besides the thing defined; e.g. if one were defining 
<A NAME="956"></A>you, he would say 'an animal which is lean' or 'pale', or something else 
<A NAME="957"></A>which will apply also to some one other than you. If any one were to say 
<A NAME="958"></A>that perhaps all the attributes taken apart may belong to many subjects, 
<A NAME="959"></A>but together they belong only to this one, we must reply first that they 
<A NAME="960"></A>belong also to both the elements; e.g. 'two-footed animal' belongs to animal 
<A NAME="961"></A>and to the two-footed. (And in the case of eternal entities this is even 
<A NAME="962"></A>necessary, since the elements are prior to and parts of the compound; nay 
<A NAME="963"></A>more, they can also exist apart, if 'man' can exist apart. For either neither 
<A NAME="964"></A>or both can. If, then, neither can, the genus will not exist apart from 
<A NAME="965"></A>the various species; but if it does, the differentia will also.) Secondly, 
<A NAME="966"></A>we must reply that 'animal' and 'two-footed' are prior in being to 'two-footed 
<A NAME="967"></A>animal'; and things which are prior to others are not destroyed when the 
<A NAME="968"></A>others are. <BR><BR>"Again, if the Ideas consist of Ideas (as they must, 
<A NAME="969"></A>since elements are simpler than the compound), it will be further necessary 
<A NAME="970"></A>that the elements also of which the Idea consists, e.g. 'animal' and 'two-footed', 
<A NAME="971"></A>should be predicated of many subjects. If not, how will they come to be 
<A NAME="972"></A>known? For there will then be an Idea which cannot be predicated of more 
<A NAME="973"></A>subjects than one. But this is not thought possible-every Idea is thought 
<A NAME="974"></A>to be capable of being shared. <BR><BR>"As has been said, then, the impossibility 
<A NAME="975"></A>of defining individuals escapes notice in the case of eternal things, especially 
<A NAME="976"></A>those which are unique, like the sun or the moon. For people err not only 
<A NAME="977"></A>by adding attributes whose removal the sun would survive, e.g. 'going round 
<A NAME="978"></A>the earth' or 'night-hidden' (for from their view it follows that if it 
<A NAME="979"></A>stands still or is visible, it will no longer be the sun; but it is strange 
<A NAME="980"></A>if this is so; for 'the sun' means a certain substance); but also by the 
<A NAME="981"></A>mention of attributes which can belong to another subject; e.g. if another 
<A NAME="982"></A>thing with the stated attributes comes into existence, clearly it will 
<A NAME="983"></A>be a sun; the formula therefore is general. But the sun was supposed to 
<A NAME="984"></A>be an individual, like Cleon or Socrates. After all, why does not one of 
<A NAME="985"></A>the supporters of the Ideas produce a definition of an Idea? It would become 
<A NAME="986"></A>clear, if they tried, that what has now been said is 
<A NAME="987"></A>true.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="988"></A><B>Part 16</B>
<A NAME="989"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="990"></A><BR><BR>"Evidently even of the things that are thought to be substances, 
<A NAME="991"></A>most are only potencies,-both the parts of animals (for none of them exists 
<A NAME="992"></A>separately; and when they are separated, then too they exist, all of them, 
<A NAME="993"></A>merely as matter) and earth and fire and air; for none of them is a unity, 
<A NAME="994"></A>but as it were a mere heap, till they are worked up and some unity is made 
<A NAME="995"></A>out of them. One might most readily suppose the parts of living things 
<A NAME="996"></A>and the parts of the soul nearly related to them to turn out to be both, 
<A NAME="997"></A>i.e. existent in complete reality as well as in potency, because they have 
<A NAME="998"></A>sources of movement in something in their joints; for which reason some 
<A NAME="999"></A>animals live when divided. Yet all the parts must exist only potentially, 
<A NAME="1000"></A>when they are one and continuous by nature,-not by force or by growing 
<A NAME="1001"></A>into one, for such a phenomenon is an abnormality. <BR><BR>"Since the term 
<A NAME="1002"></A>'unity' is used like the term 'being', and the substance of that which 
<A NAME="1003"></A>is one is one, and things whose substance is numerically one are numerically 
<A NAME="1004"></A>one, evidently neither unity nor being can be the substance of things, 
<A NAME="1005"></A>just as being an element or a principle cannot be the substance, but we 
<A NAME="1006"></A>ask what, then, the principle is, that we may reduce the thing to something 
<A NAME="1007"></A>more knowable. Now of these concepts 'being' and 'unity' are more substantial 
<A NAME="1008"></A>than 'principle' or 'element' or 'cause', but not even the former are substance, 
<A NAME="1009"></A>since in general nothing that is common is substance; for substance does 
<A NAME="1010"></A>not belong to anything but to itself and to that which has it, of which 
<A NAME="1011"></A>it is the substance. Further, that which is one cannot be in many places 
<A NAME="1012"></A>at the same time, but that which is common is present in many places at 
<A NAME="1013"></A>the same time; so that clearly no universal exists apart from its individuals. 
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>"But those who say the Forms exist, in one respect are right, in 
<A NAME="1015"></A>giving the Forms separate existence, if they are substances; but in another 
<A NAME="1016"></A>respect they are not right, because they say the one over many is a Form. 
<A NAME="1017"></A>The reason for their doing this is that they cannot declare what are the 
<A NAME="1018"></A>substances of this sort, the imperishable substances which exist apart 
<A NAME="1019"></A>from the individual and sensible substances. They make them, then, the 
<A NAME="1020"></A>same in kind as the perishable things (for this kind of substance we know)--'man-himself' 
<A NAME="1021"></A>and 'horse-itself', adding to the sensible things the word 'itself'. Yet 
<A NAME="1022"></A>even if we had not seen the stars, none the less, I suppose, would they 
<A NAME="1023"></A>have been eternal substances apart from those which we knew; so that now 
<A NAME="1024"></A>also if we do not know what non-sensible substances there are, yet it is 
<A NAME="1025"></A>doubtless necessary that there should he some.-Clearly, then, no universal 
<A NAME="1026"></A>term is the name of a substance, and no substance is composed of 
<A NAME="1027"></A>substances.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1028"></A><B>Part 17</B>
<A NAME="1029"></A>"<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1030"></A><BR><BR>"Let us state what, i.e. what kind of thing, substance should be 
<A NAME="1031"></A>said to be, taking once more another starting-point; for perhaps from this 
<A NAME="1032"></A>we shall get a clear view also of that substance which exists apart from 
<A NAME="1033"></A>sensible substances. Since, then, substance is a principle and a cause, 
<A NAME="1034"></A>let us pursue it from this starting-point. The 'why' is always sought in 
<A NAME="1035"></A>this form--'why does one thing attach to some other?' For to inquire why 
<A NAME="1036"></A>the musical man is a musical man, is either to inquire--as we have said 
<A NAME="1037"></A>why the man is musical, or it is something else. Now 'why a thing is itself' 
<A NAME="1038"></A>is a meaningless inquiry (for (to give meaning to the question 'why') the 
<A NAME="1039"></A>fact or the existence of the thing must already be evident-e.g. that the 
<A NAME="1040"></A>moon is eclipsed-but the fact that a thing is itself is the single reason 
<A NAME="1041"></A>and the single cause to be given in answer to all such questions as why 
<A NAME="1042"></A>the man is man, or the musician musical', unless one were to answer 'because 
<A NAME="1043"></A>each thing is inseparable from itself, and its being one just meant this'; 
<A NAME="1044"></A>this, however, is common to all things and is a short and easy way with 
<A NAME="1045"></A>the question). But we can inquire why man is an animal of such and such 
<A NAME="1046"></A>a nature. This, then, is plain, that we are not inquiring why he who is 
<A NAME="1047"></A>a man is a man. We are inquiring, then, why something is predicable of 
<A NAME="1048"></A>something (that it is predicable must be clear; for if not, the inquiry 
<A NAME="1049"></A>is an inquiry into nothing). E.g. why does it thunder? This is the same 
<A NAME="1050"></A>as 'why is sound produced in the clouds?' Thus the inquiry is about the 
<A NAME="1051"></A>predication of one thing of another. And why are these things, i.e. bricks 
<A NAME="1052"></A>and stones, a house? Plainly we are seeking the cause. And this is the 
<A NAME="1053"></A>essence (to speak abstractly), which in some cases is the end, e.g. perhaps 
<A NAME="1054"></A>in the case of a house or a bed, and in some cases is the first mover; 
<A NAME="1055"></A>for this also is a cause. But while the efficient cause is sought in the 
<A NAME="1056"></A>case of genesis and destruction, the final cause is sought in the case 
<A NAME="1057"></A>of being also. <BR><BR>"The object of the inquiry is most easily overlooked 
<A NAME="1058"></A>where one term is not expressly predicated of another (e.g. when we inquire 
<A NAME="1059"></A>'what man is'), because we do not distinguish and do not say definitely 
<A NAME="1060"></A>that certain elements make up a certain whole. But we must articulate our 
<A NAME="1061"></A>meaning before we begin to inquire; if not, the inquiry is on the border-line 
<A NAME="1062"></A>between being a search for something and a search for nothing. Since we
