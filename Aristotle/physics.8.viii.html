<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>It remains to consider the following question. Was there ever a becoming 
<A NAME="12"></A>of motion before which it had no being, and is it perishing again so as 
<A NAME="13"></A>to leave nothing in motion? Or are we to say that it never had any becoming 
<A NAME="14"></A>and is not perishing, but always was and always will be? Is it in fact 
<A NAME="15"></A>an immortal never-failing property of things that are, a sort of life as 
<A NAME="16"></A>it were to all naturally constituted things?
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>Now the existence of motion is asserted by all who have anything 
<A NAME="18"></A>to say about nature, because they all concern themselves with the construction 
<A NAME="19"></A>of the world and study the question of becoming and perishing, which processes 
<A NAME="20"></A>could not come about without the existence of motion. But those who say 
<A NAME="21"></A>that there is an infinite number of worlds, some of which are in process 
<A NAME="22"></A>of becoming while others are in process of perishing, assert that there 
<A NAME="23"></A>is always motion (for these processes of becoming and perishing of the 
<A NAME="24"></A>worlds necessarily involve motion), whereas those who hold that there is 
<A NAME="25"></A>only one world, whether everlasting or not, make corresponding assumptions 
<A NAME="26"></A>in regard to motion. If then it is possible that at any time nothing should 
<A NAME="27"></A>be in motion, this must come about in one of two ways: either in the manner 
<A NAME="28"></A>described by Anaxagoras, who says that all things were together and at 
<A NAME="29"></A>rest for an infinite period of time, and that then Mind introduced motion 
<A NAME="30"></A>and separated them; or in the manner described by Empedocles, according 
<A NAME="31"></A>to whom the universe is alternately in motion and at rest-in motion, when 
<A NAME="32"></A>Love is making the one out of many, or Strife is making many out of one, 
<A NAME="33"></A>and at rest in the intermediate periods of time-his account being as 
<A NAME="34"></A>follows:
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR><B>'Since One hath learned to spring from Manifold,</B> <B>And 
<A NAME="36"></A>One disjoined makes manifold arise,</B> <B>Thus they Become, nor stable 
<A NAME="37"></A>is their life:</B> <B>But since their motion must alternate be,</B> <B>Thus 
<A NAME="38"></A>have they ever Rest upon their round':</B> for we must suppose that he 
<A NAME="39"></A>means by this that they alternate from the one motion to the other. We 
<A NAME="40"></A>must consider, then, how this matter stands, for the discovery of the truth 
<A NAME="41"></A>about it is of importance, not only for the study of nature, but also for 
<A NAME="42"></A>the investigation of the First Principle.
<A NAME="43"></A><BR><BR>Let us take our start from what we have already laid down in our 
<A NAME="44"></A>course on Physics. Motion, we say, is the fulfilment of the movable in 
<A NAME="45"></A>so far as it is movable. Each kind of motion, therefore, necessarily involves 
<A NAME="46"></A>the presence of the things that are capable of that motion. In fact, even 
<A NAME="47"></A>apart from the definition of motion, every one would admit that in each 
<A NAME="48"></A>kind of motion it is that which is capable of that motion that is in motion: 
<A NAME="49"></A>thus it is that which is capable of alteration that is altered, and that 
<A NAME="50"></A>which is capable of local change that is in locomotion: and so there must 
<A NAME="51"></A>be something capable of being burned before there can be a process of being 
<A NAME="52"></A>burned, and something capable of burning before there can be a process 
<A NAME="53"></A>of burning. Moreover, these things also must either have a beginning before 
<A NAME="54"></A>which they had no being, or they must be eternal. Now if there was a becoming 
<A NAME="55"></A>of every movable thing, it follows that before the motion in question another 
<A NAME="56"></A>change or motion must have taken place in which that which was capable 
<A NAME="57"></A>of being moved or of causing motion had its becoming. To suppose, on the 
<A NAME="58"></A>other hand, that these things were in being throughout all previous time 
<A NAME="59"></A>without there being any motion appears unreasonable on a moment's thought, 
<A NAME="60"></A>and still more unreasonable, we shall find, on further consideration. For 
<A NAME="61"></A>if we are to say that, while there are on the one hand things that are 
<A NAME="62"></A>movable, and on the other hand things that are motive, there is a time 
<A NAME="63"></A>when there is a first movent and a first moved, and another time when there 
<A NAME="64"></A>is no such thing but only something that is at rest, then this thing that 
<A NAME="65"></A>is at rest must previously have been in process of change: for there must 
<A NAME="66"></A>have been some cause of its rest, rest being the privation of motion. Therefore, 
<A NAME="67"></A>before this first change there will be a previous change. For some things 
<A NAME="68"></A>cause motion in only one way, while others can produce either of two contrary 
<A NAME="69"></A>motions: thus fire causes heating but not cooling, whereas it would seem 
<A NAME="70"></A>that knowledge may be directed to two contrary ends while remaining one 
<A NAME="71"></A>and the same. Even in the former class, however, there seems to be something 
<A NAME="72"></A>similar, for a cold thing in a sense causes heating by turning away and 
<A NAME="73"></A>retiring, just as one possessed of knowledge voluntarily makes an error 
<A NAME="74"></A>when he uses his knowledge in the reverse way. But at any rate all things 
<A NAME="75"></A>that are capable respectively of affecting and being affected, or of causing 
<A NAME="76"></A>motion and being moved, are capable of it not under all conditions, but 
<A NAME="77"></A>only when they are in a particular condition and approach one another: 
<A NAME="78"></A>so it is on the approach of one thing to another that the one causes motion 
<A NAME="79"></A>and the other is moved, and when they are present under such conditions 
<A NAME="80"></A>as rendered the one motive and the other movable. So if the motion was 
<A NAME="81"></A>not always in process, it is clear that they must have been in a condition 
<A NAME="82"></A>not such as to render them capable respectively of being moved and of causing 
<A NAME="83"></A>motion, and one or other of them must have been in process of change: for 
<A NAME="84"></A>in what is relative this is a necessary consequence: e.g. if one thing 
<A NAME="85"></A>is double another when before it was not so, one or other of them, if not 
<A NAME="86"></A>both, must have been in process of change. It follows then, that there 
<A NAME="87"></A>will be a process of change previous to the first.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>(Further, how can there be any 'before' and 'after' without the 
<A NAME="89"></A>existence of time? Or how can there be any time without the existence of 
<A NAME="90"></A>motion? If, then, time is the number of motion or itself a kind of motion, 
<A NAME="91"></A>it follows that, if there is always time, motion must also be eternal. 
<A NAME="92"></A>But so far as time is concerned we see that all with one exception are 
<A NAME="93"></A>in agreement in saying that it is uncreated: in fact, it is just this that 
<A NAME="94"></A>enables Democritus to show that all things cannot have had a becoming: 
<A NAME="95"></A>for time, he says, is uncreated. Plato alone asserts the creation of time, 
<A NAME="96"></A>saying that it had a becoming together with the universe, the universe 
<A NAME="97"></A>according to him having had a becoming. Now since time cannot exist and 
<A NAME="98"></A>is unthinkable apart from the moment, and the moment a kind of middle-point, 
<A NAME="99"></A>uniting as it does in itself both a beginning and an end, a beginning of 
<A NAME="100"></A>future time and an end of past time, it follows that there must always 
<A NAME="101"></A>be time: for the extremity of the last period of time that we take must 
<A NAME="102"></A>be found in some moment, since time contains no point of contact for us 
<A NAME="103"></A>except the moment. Therefore, since the moment is both a beginning and 
<A NAME="104"></A>an end, there must always be time on both sides of it. But if this is true 
<A NAME="105"></A>of time, it is evident that it must also be true of motion, time being 
<A NAME="106"></A>a kind of affection of motion.)
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>The same reasoning will also serve to show the imperishability 
<A NAME="108"></A>of motion: just as a becoming of motion would involve, as we saw, the existence 
<A NAME="109"></A>of a process of change previous to the first, in the same way a perishing 
<A NAME="110"></A>of motion would involve the existence of a process of change subsequent 
<A NAME="111"></A>to the last: for when a thing ceases to be moved, it does not therefore 
<A NAME="112"></A>at the same time cease to be movable-e.g. the cessation of the process 
<A NAME="113"></A>of being burned does not involve the cessation of the capacity of being 
<A NAME="114"></A>burned, since a thing may be capable of being burned without being in process 
<A NAME="115"></A>of being burned-nor, when a thing ceases to be movent, does it therefore 
<A NAME="116"></A>at the same time cease to a be motive. Again, the destructive agent will 
<A NAME="117"></A>have to be destroyed, after what it destroys has been destroyed, and then 
<A NAME="118"></A>that which has the capacity of destroying it will have to be destroyed 
<A NAME="119"></A>afterwards, (so that there will be a process of change subsequent to the 
<A NAME="120"></A>last,) for being destroyed also is a kind of change. If, then, view which 
<A NAME="121"></A>we are criticizing involves these impossible consequences, it is clear 
<A NAME="122"></A>that motion is eternal and cannot have existed at one time and not at another: 
<A NAME="123"></A>in fact such a view can hardly be described as anythling else than 
<A NAME="124"></A>fantastic.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR><BR>And much the same may be said of the view that such is the ordinance 
<A NAME="126"></A>of nature and that this must be regarded as a principle, as would seem 
<A NAME="127"></A>to be the view of Empedocles when he says that the constitution of the 
<A NAME="128"></A>world is of necessity such that Love and Strife alternately predominate 
<A NAME="129"></A>and cause motion, while in the intermediate period of time there is a state 
<A NAME="130"></A>of rest. Probably also those who like like Anaxagoras, assert a single 
<A NAME="131"></A>principle (of motion) would hold this view. But that which is produced 
<A NAME="132"></A>or directed by nature can never be anything disorderly: for nature is everywhere 
<A NAME="133"></A>the cause of order. Moreover, there is no ratio in the relation of the 
<A NAME="134"></A>infinite to the infinite, whereas order always means ratio. But if we say 
<A NAME="135"></A>that there is first a state of rest for an infinite time, and then motion 
<A NAME="136"></A>is started at some moment, and that the fact that it is this rather than 
<A NAME="137"></A>a previous moment is of no importance, and involves no order, then we can 
<A NAME="138"></A>no longer say that it is nature's work: for if anything is of a certain 
<A NAME="139"></A>character naturally, it either is so invariably and is not sometimes of 
<A NAME="140"></A>this and sometimes of another character (e.g. fire, which travels upwards 
<A NAME="141"></A>naturally, does not sometimes do so and sometimes not) or there is a ratio 
<A NAME="142"></A>in the variation. It would be better, therefore, to say with Empedocles 
<A NAME="143"></A>and any one else who may have maintained such a theory as his that the 
<A NAME="144"></A>universe is alternately at rest and in motion: for in a system of this 
<A NAME="145"></A>kind we have at once a certain order. But even here the holder of the theory 
<A NAME="146"></A>ought not only to assert the fact: he ought to explain the cause of it: 
<A NAME="147"></A>i.e. he should not make any mere assumption or lay down any gratuitous 
<A NAME="148"></A>axiom, but should employ either inductive or demonstrative reasoning. The 
<A NAME="149"></A>Love and Strife postulated by Empedocles are not in themselves causes of 
<A NAME="150"></A>the fact in question, nor is it of the essence of either that it should 
<A NAME="151"></A>be so, the essential function of the former being to unite, of the latter 
<A NAME="152"></A>to separate. If he is to go on to explain this alternate predominance, 
<A NAME="153"></A>he should adduce cases where such a state of things exists, as he points 
<A NAME="154"></A>to the fact that among mankind we have something that unites men, namely 
<A NAME="155"></A>Love, while on the other hand enemies avoid one another: thus from the 
<A NAME="156"></A>observed fact that this occurs in certain cases comes the assumption that 
<A NAME="157"></A>it occurs also in the universe. Then, again, some argument is needed to 
<A NAME="158"></A>explain why the predominance of each of the two forces lasts for an equal 
<A NAME="159"></A>period of time. But it is a wrong assumption to suppose universally that 
<A NAME="160"></A>we have an adequate first principle in virtue of the fact that something 
<A NAME="161"></A>always is so or always happens so. Thus Democritus reduces the causes that 
<A NAME="162"></A>explain nature to the fact that things happened in the past in the same 
<A NAME="163"></A>way as they happen now: but he does not think fit to seek for a first principle 
<A NAME="164"></A>to explain this 'always': so, while his theory is right in so far as it 
<A NAME="165"></A>is applied to certain individual cases, he is wrong in making it of universal 
<A NAME="166"></A>application. Thus, a triangle always has its angles equal to two right 
<A NAME="167"></A>angles, but there is nevertheless an ulterior cause of the eternity of 
<A NAME="168"></A>this truth, whereas first principles are eternal and have no ulterior cause. 
<A NAME="169"></A>Let this conclude what we have to say in support of our contention that 
<A NAME="170"></A>there never was a time when there was not motion, and never will be a time 
<A NAME="171"></A>when there will not be motion.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="172"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>The arguments that may be advanced against this position are not 
<A NAME="174"></A>difficult to dispose of. The chief considerations that might be thought 
<A NAME="175"></A>to indicate that motion may exist though at one time it had not existed 
<A NAME="176"></A>at all are the following:
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>First, it may be said that no process of change is eternal: for 
<A NAME="178"></A>the nature of all change is such that it proceeds from something to something, 
<A NAME="179"></A>so that every process of change must be bounded by the contraries that 
<A NAME="180"></A>mark its course, and no motion can go on to infinity.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>Secondly, we see that a thing that neither is in motion nor contains 
<A NAME="182"></A>any motion within itself can be set in motion; e.g. inanimate things that 
<A NAME="183"></A>are (whether the whole or some part is in question) not in motion but at 
<A NAME="184"></A>rest, are at some moment set in motion: whereas, if motion cannot have 
<A NAME="185"></A>a becoming before which it had no being, these things ought to be either 
<A NAME="186"></A>always or never in motion.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>Thirdly, the fact is evident above all in the case of animate beings: 
<A NAME="188"></A>for it sometimes happens that there is no motion in us and we are quite 
<A NAME="189"></A>still, and that nevertheless we are then at some moment set in motion, 
<A NAME="190"></A>that is to say it sometimes happens that we produce a beginning of motion 
<A NAME="191"></A>in ourselves spontaneously without anything having set us in motion from 
<A NAME="192"></A>without. We see nothing like this in the case of inanimate things, which 
<A NAME="193"></A>are always set in motion by something else from without: the animal, on 
<A NAME="194"></A>the other hand, we say, moves itself: therefore, if an animal is ever in 
<A NAME="195"></A>a state of absolute rest, we have a motionless thing in which motion can 
<A NAME="196"></A>be produced from the thing itself, and not from without. Now if this can 
<A NAME="197"></A>occur in an animal, why should not the same be true also of the universe 
<A NAME="198"></A>as a whole? If it can occur in a small world it could also occur in a great 
<A NAME="199"></A>one: and if it can occur in the world, it could also occur in the infinite; 
<A NAME="200"></A>that is, if the infinite could as a whole possibly be in motion or at 
<A NAME="201"></A>rest.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>Of these objections, then, the first-mentioned motion to opposites 
<A NAME="203"></A>is not always the same and numerically one a correct statement; in fact, 
<A NAME="204"></A>this may be said to be a necessary conclusion, provided that it is possible 
<A NAME="205"></A>for the motion of that which is one and the same to be not always one and 
<A NAME="206"></A>the same. (I mean that e.g. we may question whether the note given by a 
<A NAME="207"></A>single string is one and the same, or is different each time the string 
<A NAME="208"></A>is struck, although the string is in the same condition and is moved in 
<A NAME="209"></A>the same way.) But still, however this may be, there is nothing to prevent 
<A NAME="210"></A>there being a motion that is the same in virtue of being continuous and 
<A NAME="211"></A>eternal: we shall have something to say later that will make this point 
<A NAME="212"></A>clearer.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>As regards the second objection, no absurdity is involved in the 
<A NAME="214"></A>fact that something not in motion may be set in motion, that which caused 
<A NAME="215"></A>the motion from without being at one time present, and at another absent. 
<A NAME="216"></A>Nevertheless, how this can be so remains matter for inquiry; how it comes 
<A NAME="217"></A>about, I mean, that the same motive force at one time causes a thing to 
<A NAME="218"></A>be in motion, and at another does not do so: for the difficulty raised 
<A NAME="219"></A>by our objector really amounts to this-why is it that some things are not 
<A NAME="220"></A>always at rest, and the rest always in motion?
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>The third objection may be thought to present more difficulty than 
<A NAME="222"></A>the others, namely, that which alleges that motion arises in things in 
<A NAME="223"></A>which it did not exist before, and adduces in proof the case of animate 
<A NAME="224"></A>things: thus an animal is first at rest and afterwards walks, not having 
<A NAME="225"></A>been set in motion apparently by anything from without. This, however, 
<A NAME="226"></A>is false: for we observe that there is always some part of the animal's 
<A NAME="227"></A>organism in motion, and the cause of the motion of this part is not the 
<A NAME="228"></A>animal itself, but, it may be, its environment. Moreover, we say that the 
<A NAME="229"></A>animal itself originates not all of its motions but its locomotion. So 
<A NAME="230"></A>it may well be the case-or rather we may perhaps say that it must necessarily 
<A NAME="231"></A>be the case-that many motions are produced in the body by its environment, 
<A NAME="232"></A>and some of these set in motion the intellect or the appetite, and this 
<A NAME="233"></A>again then sets the whole animal in motion: this is what happens when animals 
<A NAME="234"></A>are asleep: though there is then no perceptive motion in them, there is 
<A NAME="235"></A>some motion that causes them to wake up again. But we will leave this point 
<A NAME="236"></A>also to be elucidated at a later stage in our discussion.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="237"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="238"></A><BR><BR>Our enquiry will resolve itself at the outset into a consideration 
<A NAME="239"></A>of the above-mentioned problem-what can be the reason why some things in 
<A NAME="240"></A>the world at one time are in motion and at another are at rest again? Now 
<A NAME="241"></A>one of three things must be true: either all things are always at rest, 
<A NAME="242"></A>or all things are always in motion, or some things are in motion and others 
<A NAME="243"></A>at rest: and in this last case again either the things that are in motion 
<A NAME="244"></A>are always in motion and the things that are at rest are always at rest, 
<A NAME="245"></A>or they are all constituted so as to be capable alike of motion and of 
<A NAME="246"></A>rest; or there is yet a third possibility remaining-it may be that some 
<A NAME="247"></A>things in the world are always motionless, others always in motion, while 
<A NAME="248"></A>others again admit of both conditions. This last is the account of the 
<A NAME="249"></A>matter that we must give: for herein lies the solution of all the difficulties 
<A NAME="250"></A>raised and the conclusion of the investigation upon which we are 
<A NAME="251"></A>engaged.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>To maintain that all things are at rest, and to disregard sense-perception 
<A NAME="253"></A>in an attempt to show the theory to be reasonable, would be an instance 
<A NAME="254"></A>of intellectual weakness: it would call in question a whole system, not 
<A NAME="255"></A>a particular detail: moreover, it would be an attack not only on the physicist 
<A NAME="256"></A>but on almost all sciences and all received opinions, since motion plays 
<A NAME="257"></A>a part in all of them. Further, just as in arguments about mathematics 
<A NAME="258"></A>objections that involve first principles do not affect the mathematician-and 
<A NAME="259"></A>the other sciences are in similar case-so, too, objections involving the 
<A NAME="260"></A>point that we have just raised do not affect the physicist: for it is a 
<A NAME="261"></A>fundamental assumption with him that motion is ultimately referable to 
<A NAME="262"></A>nature herself.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>The assertion that all things are in motion we may fairly regard 
<A NAME="264"></A>as equally false, though it is less subversive of physical science: for 
<A NAME="265"></A>though in our course on physics it was laid down that rest no less than 
<A NAME="266"></A>motion is ultimately referable to nature herself, nevertheless motion is 
<A NAME="267"></A>the characteristic fact of nature: moreover, the view is actually held 
<A NAME="268"></A>by some that not merely some things but all things in the world are in 
<A NAME="269"></A>motion and always in motion, though we cannot apprehend the fact by sense-perception. 
<A NAME="270"></A>Although the supporters of this theory do not state clearly what kind of 
<A NAME="271"></A>motion they mean, or whether they mean all kinds, it is no hard matter 
<A NAME="272"></A>to reply to them: thus we may point out that there cannot be a continuous 
<A NAME="273"></A>process either of increase or of decrease: that which comes between the 
<A NAME="274"></A>two has to be included. The theory resembles that about the stone being 
<A NAME="275"></A>worn away by the drop of water or split by plants growing out of it: if 
<A NAME="276"></A>so much has been extruded or removed by the drop, it does not follow that 
<A NAME="277"></A>half the amount has previously been extruded or removed in half the time: 
<A NAME="278"></A>the case of the hauled ship is exactly comparable: here we have so many 
<A NAME="279"></A>drops setting so much in motion, but a part of them will not set as much 
<A NAME="280"></A>in motion in any period of time. The amount removed is, it is true, divisible 
<A NAME="281"></A>into a number of parts, but no one of these was set in motion separately: 
<A NAME="282"></A>they were all set in motion together. It is evident, then, that from the 
<A NAME="283"></A>fact that the decrease is divisible into an infinite number of parts it 
<A NAME="284"></A>does not follow that some part must always be passing away: it all passes 
<A NAME="285"></A>away at a particular moment. Similarly, too, in the case of any alteration 
<A NAME="286"></A>whatever if that which suffers alteration is infinitely divisible it does 
<A NAME="287"></A>not follow from this that the same is true of the alteration itself, which 
<A NAME="288"></A>often occurs all at once, as in freezing. Again, when any one has fallen 
<A NAME="289"></A>ill, there must follow a period of time in which his restoration to health 
<A NAME="290"></A>is in the future: the process of change cannot take place in an instant: 
<A NAME="291"></A>yet the change cannot be a change to anything else but health. The assertion. 
<A NAME="292"></A>therefore, that alteration is continuous is an extravagant calling into 
<A NAME="293"></A>question of the obvious: for alteration is a change from one contrary to 
<A NAME="294"></A>another. Moreover, we notice that a stone becomes neither harder nor softer. 
<A NAME="295"></A>Again, in the matter of locomotion, it would be a strange thing if a stone 
<A NAME="296"></A>could be falling or resting on the ground without our being able to perceive 
<A NAME="297"></A>the fact. Further, it is a law of nature that earth and all other bodies 
<A NAME="298"></A>should remain in their proper places and be moved from them only by violence: 
<A NAME="299"></A>from the fact then that some of them are in their proper places it follows 
<A NAME="300"></A>that in respect of place also all things cannot be in motion. These and 
<A NAME="301"></A>other similar arguments, then, should convince us that it is impossible 
<A NAME="302"></A>either that all things are always in motion or that all things are always 
<A NAME="303"></A>at rest.
<A NAME="304"></A><BR><BR>Nor again can it be that some things are always at rest, others 
<A NAME="305"></A>always in motion, and nothing sometimes at rest and sometimes in motion. 
<A NAME="306"></A>This theory must be pronounced impossible on the same grounds as those 
<A NAME="307"></A>previously mentioned: viz. that we see the above-mentioned changes occurring 
<A NAME="308"></A>in the case of the same things. We may further point out that the defender 
<A NAME="309"></A>of this position is fighting against the obvious, for on this theory there 
<A NAME="310"></A>can be no such thing as increase: nor can there be any such thing as compulsory 
<A NAME="311"></A>motion, if it is impossible that a thing can be at rest before being set 
<A NAME="312"></A>in motion unnaturally. This theory, then, does away with becoming and perishing. 
<A NAME="313"></A>Moreover, motion, it would seem, is generally thought to be a sort of becoming 
<A NAME="314"></A>and perishing, for that to which a thing changes comes to be, or occupancy 
<A NAME="315"></A>of it comes to be, and that from which a thing changes ceases to be, or 
<A NAME="316"></A>there ceases to be occupancy of it. It is clear, therefore, that there 
<A NAME="317"></A>are cases of occasional motion and occasional rest.
<A NAME="318"></A><BR><BR>We have now to take the assertion that all things are sometimes 
<A NAME="319"></A>at rest and sometimes in motion and to confront it with the arguments previously 
<A NAME="320"></A>advanced. We must take our start as before from the possibilities that 
<A NAME="321"></A>we distinguished just above. Either all things are at rest, or all things 
<A NAME="322"></A>are in motion, or some things are at rest and others in motion. And if 
<A NAME="323"></A>some things are at rest and others in motion, then it must be that either 
<A NAME="324"></A>all things are sometimes at rest and sometimes in motion, or some things 
<A NAME="325"></A>are always at rest and the remainder always in motion, or some of the things 
<A NAME="326"></A>are always at rest and others always in motion while others again are sometimes 
<A NAME="327"></A>at rest and sometimes in motion. Now we have said before that it is impossible 
<A NAME="328"></A>that all things should be at rest: nevertheless we may now repeat that 
<A NAME="329"></A>assertion. We may point out that, even if it is really the case, as certain 
<A NAME="330"></A>persons assert, that the existent is infinite and motionless, it certainly 
<A NAME="331"></A>does not appear to be so if we follow sense-perception: many things that 
<A NAME="332"></A>exist appear to be in motion. Now if there is such a thing as false opinion 
<A NAME="333"></A>or opinion at all, there is also motion; and similarly if there is such 
<A NAME="334"></A>a thing as imagination, or if it is the case that anything seems to be 
<A NAME="335"></A>different at different times: for imagination and opinion are thought to 
<A NAME="336"></A>be motions of a kind. But to investigate this question at all-to seek a 
<A NAME="337"></A>reasoned justification of a belief with regard to which we are too well 
<A NAME="338"></A>off to require reasoned justification-implies bad judgement of what is 
<A NAME="339"></A>better and what is worse, what commends itself to belief and what does 
<A NAME="340"></A>not, what is ultimate and what is not. It is likewise impossible that all 
<A NAME="341"></A>things should be in motion or that some things should be always in motion 
<A NAME="342"></A>and the remainder always at rest. We have sufficient ground for rejecting 
<A NAME="343"></A>all these theories in the single fact that we see some things that are 
<A NAME="344"></A>sometimes in motion and sometimes at rest. It is evident, therefore, that 
<A NAME="345"></A>it is no less impossible that some things should be always in motion and 
<A NAME="346"></A>the remainder always at rest than that all things should be at rest or 
<A NAME="347"></A>that all things should be in motion continuously. It remains, then, to 
<A NAME="348"></A>consider whether all things are so constituted as to be capable both of 
<A NAME="349"></A>being in motion and of being at rest, or whether, while some things are 
<A NAME="350"></A>so constituted, some are always at rest and some are always in motion: 
<A NAME="351"></A>for it is this last view that we have to show to be 
<A NAME="352"></A>true.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="353"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>Now of things that cause motion or suffer motion, to some the motion 
<A NAME="355"></A>is accidental, to others essential: thus it is accidental to what merely 
<A NAME="356"></A>belongs to or contains as a part a thing that causes motion or suffers 
<A NAME="357"></A>motion, essential to a thing that causes motion or suffers motion not merely 
<A NAME="358"></A>by belonging to such a thing or containing it as a part.
<A NAME="359"></A><BR><BR>Of things to which the motion is essential some derive their motion 
<A NAME="360"></A>from themselves, others from something else: and in some cases their motion 
<A NAME="361"></A>is natural, in others violent and unnatural. Thus in things that derive 
<A NAME="362"></A>their motion from themselves, e.g. all animals, the motion is natural (for 
<A NAME="363"></A>when an animal is in motion its motion is derived from itself): and whenever 
<A NAME="364"></A>the source of the motion of a thing is in the thing itself we say that 
<A NAME="365"></A>the motion of that thing is natural. Therefore the animal as a whole moves 
<A NAME="366"></A>itself naturally: but the body of the animal may be in motion unnaturally 
<A NAME="367"></A>as well as naturally: it depends upon the kind of motion that it may chance 
<A NAME="368"></A>to be suffering and the kind of element of which it is composed. And the 
<A NAME="369"></A>motion of things that derive their motion from something else is in some 
<A NAME="370"></A>cases natural, in other unnatural: e.g. upward motion of earthy things 
<A NAME="371"></A>and downward motion of fire are unnatural. Moreover the parts of animals 
<A NAME="372"></A>are often in motion in an unnatural way, their positions and the character 
<A NAME="373"></A>of the motion being abnormal. The fact that a thing that is in motion derives 
<A NAME="374"></A>its motion from something is most evident in things that are in motion 
<A NAME="375"></A>unnaturally, because in such cases it is clear that the motion is derived 
<A NAME="376"></A>from something other than the thing itself. Next to things that are in 
<A NAME="377"></A>motion unnaturally those whose motion while natural is derived from themselves-e.g. 
<A NAME="378"></A>animals-make this fact clear: for here the uncertainty is not as to whether 
<A NAME="379"></A>the motion is derived from something but as to how we ought to distinguish 
<A NAME="380"></A>in the thing between the movent and the moved. It would seem that in animals, 
<A NAME="381"></A>just as in ships and things not naturally organized, that which causes 
<A NAME="382"></A>motion is separate from that which suffers motion, and that it is only 
<A NAME="383"></A>in this sense that the animal as a whole causes its own 
<A NAME="384"></A>motion.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>The greatest difficulty, however, is presented by the remaining 
<A NAME="386"></A>case of those that we last distinguished. Where things derive their motion 
<A NAME="387"></A>from something else we distinguished the cases in which the motion is unnatural: 
<A NAME="388"></A>we are left with those that are to be contrasted with the others by reason 
<A NAME="389"></A>of the fact that the motion is natural. It is in these cases that difficulty 
<A NAME="390"></A>would be experienced in deciding whence the motion is derived, e.g. in 
<A NAME="391"></A>the case of light and heavy things. When these things are in motion to 
<A NAME="392"></A>positions the reverse of those they would properly occupy, their motion 
<A NAME="393"></A>is violent: when they are in motion to their proper positions-the light 
<A NAME="394"></A>thing up and the heavy thing down-their motion is natural; but in this 
<A NAME="395"></A>latter case it is no longer evident, as it is when the motion is unnatural, 
<A NAME="396"></A>whence their motion is derived. It is impossible to say that their motion 
<A NAME="397"></A>is derived from themselves: this is a characteristic of life and peculiar 
<A NAME="398"></A>to living things. Further, if it were, it would have been in their power 
<A NAME="399"></A>to stop themselves (I mean that if e.g. a thing can cause itself to walk 
<A NAME="400"></A>it can also cause itself not to walk), and so, since on this supposition 
<A NAME="401"></A>fire itself possesses the power of upward locomotion, it is clear that 
<A NAME="402"></A>it should also possess the power of downward locomotion. Moreover if things 
<A NAME="403"></A>move themselves, it would be unreasonable to suppose that in only one kind 
<A NAME="404"></A>of motion is their motion derived from themselves. Again, how can anything 
<A NAME="405"></A>of continuous and naturally connected substance move itself? In so far 
<A NAME="406"></A>as a thing is one and continuous not merely in virtue of contact, it is 
<A NAME="407"></A>impassive: it is only in so far as a thing is divided that one part of 
<A NAME="408"></A>it is by nature active and another passive. Therefore none of the things 
<A NAME="409"></A>that we are now considering move themselves (for they are of naturally 
<A NAME="410"></A>connected substance), nor does anything else that is continuous: in each 
<A NAME="411"></A>case the movent must be separate from the moved, as we see to be the case 
<A NAME="412"></A>with inanimate things when an animate thing moves them. It is the fact 
<A NAME="413"></A>that these things also always derive their motion from something: what 
<A NAME="414"></A>it is would become evident if we were to distinguish the different kinds 
<A NAME="415"></A>of cause.
<A NAME="416"></A><BR><BR>The above-mentioned distinctions can also be made in the case of 
<A NAME="417"></A>things that cause motion: some of them are capable of causing motion unnaturally 
<A NAME="418"></A>(e.g. the lever is not naturally capable of moving the weight), others 
<A NAME="419"></A>naturally (e.g. what is actually hot is naturally capable of moving what 
<A NAME="420"></A>is potentially hot): and similarly in the case of all other things of this 
<A NAME="421"></A>kind.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>In the same way, too, what is potentially of a certain quality 
<A NAME="423"></A>or of a certain quantity in a certain place is naturally movable when it 
<A NAME="424"></A>contains the corresponding principle in itself and not accidentally (for 
<A NAME="425"></A>the same thing may be both of a certain quality and of a certain quantity, 
<A NAME="426"></A>but the one is an accidental, not an essential property of the other). 
<A NAME="427"></A>So when fire or earth is moved by something the motion is violent when 
<A NAME="428"></A>it is unnatural, and natural when it brings to actuality the proper activities 
<A NAME="429"></A>that they potentially possess. But the fact that the term 'potentially' 
<A NAME="430"></A>is used in more than one sense is the reason why it is not evident whence 
<A NAME="431"></A>such motions as the upward motion of fire and the downward motion of earth 
<A NAME="432"></A>are derived. One who is learning a science potentially knows it in a different 
<A NAME="433"></A>sense from one who while already possessing the knowledge is not actually 
<A NAME="434"></A>exercising it. Wherever we have something capable of acting and something 
<A NAME="435"></A>capable of being correspondingly acted on, in the event of any such pair 
<A NAME="436"></A>being in contact what is potential becomes at times actual: e.g. the learner 
<A NAME="437"></A>becomes from one potential something another potential something: for one 
<A NAME="438"></A>who possesses knowledge of a science but is not actually exercising it 
<A NAME="439"></A>knows the science potentially in a sense, though not in the same sense 
<A NAME="440"></A>as he knew it potentially before he learnt it. And when he is in this condition, 
<A NAME="441"></A>if something does not prevent him, he actively exercises his knowledge: 
<A NAME="442"></A>otherwise he would be in the contradictory state of not knowing. In regard 
<A NAME="443"></A>to natural bodies also the case is similar. Thus what is cold is potentially 
<A NAME="444"></A>hot: then a change takes place and it is fire, and it burns, unless something 
<A NAME="445"></A>prevents and hinders it. So, too, with heavy and light: light is generated 
<A NAME="446"></A>from heavy, e.g. air from water (for water is the first thing that is potentially 
<A NAME="447"></A>light), and air is actually light, and will at once realize its proper 
<A NAME="448"></A>activity as such unless something prevents it. The activity of lightness 
<A NAME="449"></A>consists in the light thing being in a certain situation, namely high up: 
<A NAME="450"></A>when it is in the contrary situation, it is being prevented from rising. 
<A NAME="451"></A>The case is similar also in regard to quantity and quality. But, be it 
<A NAME="452"></A>noted, this is the question we are trying to answer-how can we account 
<A NAME="453"></A>for the motion of light things and heavy things to their proper situations? 
<A NAME="454"></A>The reason for it is that they have a natural tendency respectively towards 
<A NAME="455"></A>a certain position: and this constitutes the essence of lightness and heaviness, 
<A NAME="456"></A>the former being determined by an upward, the latter by a downward, tendency. 
<A NAME="457"></A>As we have said, a thing may be potentially light or heavy in more senses 
<A NAME="458"></A>than one. Thus not only when a thing is water is it in a sense potentially 
<A NAME="459"></A>light, but when it has become air it may be still potentially light: for 
<A NAME="460"></A>it may be that through some hindrance it does not occupy an upper position, 
<A NAME="461"></A>whereas, if what hinders it is removed, it realizes its activity and continues 
<A NAME="462"></A>to rise higher. The process whereby what is of a certain quality changes 
<A NAME="463"></A>to a condition of active existence is similar: thus the exercise of knowledge 
<A NAME="464"></A>follows at once upon the possession of it unless something prevents it. 
<A NAME="465"></A>So, too, what is of a certain quantity extends itself over a certain space 
<A NAME="466"></A>unless something prevents it. The thing in a sense is and in a sense is 
<A NAME="467"></A>not moved by one who moves what is obstructing and preventing its motion 
<A NAME="468"></A>(e.g. one who pulls away a pillar from under a roof or one who removes 
<A NAME="469"></A>a stone from a wineskin in the water is the accidental cause of motion): 
<A NAME="470"></A>and in the same way the real cause of the motion of a ball rebounding from 
<A NAME="471"></A>a wall is not the wall but the thrower. So it is clear that in all these 
<A NAME="472"></A>cases the thing does not move itself, but it contains within itself the 
<A NAME="473"></A>source of motion-not of moving something or of causing motion, but of suffering 
<A NAME="474"></A>it.
<A NAME="475"></A><BR><BR>If then the motion of all things that are in motion is either natural 
<A NAME="476"></A>or unnatural and violent, and all things whose motion is violent and unnatural 
<A NAME="477"></A>are moved by something, and something other than themselves, and again 
<A NAME="478"></A>all things whose motion is natural are moved by something-both those that 
<A NAME="479"></A>are moved by themselves and those that are not moved by themselves (e.g. 
<A NAME="480"></A>light things and heavy things, which are moved either by that which brought 
<A NAME="481"></A>the thing into existence as such and made it light and heavy, or by that 
<A NAME="482"></A>which released what was hindering and preventing it); then all things that 
<A NAME="483"></A>are in motion must be moved by something.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="484"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="485"></A><BR><BR>Now this may come about in either of two ways. Either the movent 
<A NAME="486"></A>is not itself responsible for the motion, which is to be referred to something 
<A NAME="487"></A>else which moves the movent, or the movent is itself responsible for the 
<A NAME="488"></A>motion. Further, in the latter case, either the movent immediately precedes 
<A NAME="489"></A>the last thing in the series, or there may be one or more intermediate 
<A NAME="490"></A>links: e.g. the stick moves the stone and is moved by the hand, which again 
<A NAME="491"></A>is moved by the man: in the man, however, we have reached a movent that 
<A NAME="492"></A>is not so in virtue of being moved by something else. Now we say that the 
<A NAME="493"></A>thing is moved both by the last and by the first movent in the series, 
<A NAME="494"></A>but more strictly by the first, since the first movent moves the last, 
<A NAME="495"></A>whereas the last does not move the first, and the first will move the thing 
<A NAME="496"></A>without the last, but the last will not move it without the first: e.g. 
<A NAME="497"></A>the stick will not move anything unless it is itself moved by the man. 
<A NAME="498"></A>If then everything that is in motion must be moved by something, and the 
<A NAME="499"></A>movent must either itself be moved by something else or not, and in the 
<A NAME="500"></A>former case there must be some first movent that is not itself moved by 
<A NAME="501"></A>anything else, while in the case of the immediate movent being of this 
<A NAME="502"></A>kind there is no need of an intermediate movent that is also moved (for 
<A NAME="503"></A>it is impossible that there should be an infinite series of movents, each 
<A NAME="504"></A>of which is itself moved by something else, since in an infinite series 
<A NAME="505"></A>there is no first term)-if then everything that is in motion is moved by 
<A NAME="506"></A>something, and the first movent is moved but not by anything else, it much 
<A NAME="507"></A>be moved by itself.
<A NAME="508"></A><BR><BR>This same argument may also be stated in another way as follows. 
<A NAME="509"></A>Every movent moves something and moves it with something, either with itself 
<A NAME="510"></A>or with something else: e.g. a man moves a thing either himself or with 
<A NAME="511"></A>a stick, and a thing is knocked down either by the wind itself or by a 
<A NAME="512"></A>stone propelled by the wind. But it is impossible for that with which a 
<A NAME="513"></A>thing is moved to move it without being moved by that which imparts motion 
<A NAME="514"></A>by its own agency: on the other hand, if a thing imparts motion by its 
<A NAME="515"></A>own agency, it is not necessary that there should be anything else with 
<A NAME="516"></A>which it imparts motion, whereas if there is a different thing with which 
<A NAME="517"></A>it imparts motion, there must be something that imparts motion not with 
<A NAME="518"></A>something else but with itself, or else there will be an infinite series. 
<A NAME="519"></A>If, then, anything is a movent while being itself moved, the series must 
<A NAME="520"></A>stop somewhere and not be infinite. Thus, if the stick moves something 
<A NAME="521"></A>in virtue of being moved by the hand, the hand moves the stick: and if 
<A NAME="522"></A>something else moves with the hand, the hand also is moved by something 
<A NAME="523"></A>different from itself. So when motion by means of an instrument is at each 
<A NAME="524"></A>stage caused by something different from the instrument, this must always 
<A NAME="525"></A>be preceded by something else which imparts motion with itself. Therefore, 
<A NAME="526"></A>if this last movent is in motion and there is nothing else that moves it, 
<A NAME="527"></A>it must move itself. So this reasoning also shows that when a thing is 
<A NAME="528"></A>moved, if it is not moved immediately by something that moves itself, the 
<A NAME="529"></A>series brings us at some time or other to a movent of this 
<A NAME="530"></A>kind.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>And if we consider the matter in yet a third wa Ly we shall get 
<A NAME="532"></A>this same result as follows. If everything that is in motion is moved by 
<A NAME="533"></A>something that is in motion, ether this being in motion is an accidental 
<A NAME="534"></A>attribute of the movents in question, so that each of them moves something 
<A NAME="535"></A>while being itself in motion, but not always because it is itself in motion, 
<A NAME="536"></A>or it is not accidental but an essential attribute. Let us consider the 
<A NAME="537"></A>former alternative. If then it is an accidental attribute, it is not necessary 
<A NAME="538"></A>that that is in motion should be in motion: and if this is so it is clear 
<A NAME="539"></A>that there may be a time when nothing that exists is in motion, since the 
<A NAME="540"></A>accidental is not necessary but contingent. Now if we assume the existence 
<A NAME="541"></A>of a possibility, any conclusion that we thereby reach will not be an impossibility 
<A NAME="542"></A>though it may be contrary to fact. But the nonexistence of motion is an 
<A NAME="543"></A>impossibility: for we have shown above that there must always be 
<A NAME="544"></A>motion.
<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, the conclusion to which we have been led is a reasonable 
<A NAME="546"></A>one. For there must be three things-the moved, the movent, and the instrument 
<A NAME="547"></A>of motion. Now the moved must be in motion, but it need not move anything 
<A NAME="548"></A>else: the instrument of motion must both move something else and be itself 
<A NAME="549"></A>in motion (for it changes together with the moved, with which it is in 
<A NAME="550"></A>contact and continuous, as is clear in the case of things that move other 
<A NAME="551"></A>things locally, in which case the two things must up to a certain point 
<A NAME="552"></A>be in contact): and the movent-that is to say, that which causes motion 
<A NAME="553"></A>in such a manner that it is not merely the instrument of motion-must be 
<A NAME="554"></A>unmoved. Now we have visual experience of the last term in this series, 
<A NAME="555"></A>namely that which has the capacity of being in motion, but does not contain 
<A NAME="556"></A>a motive principle, and also of that which is in motion but is moved by 
<A NAME="557"></A>itself and not by anything else: it is reasonable, therefore, not to say 
<A NAME="558"></A>necessary, to suppose the existence of the third term also, that which 
<A NAME="559"></A>causes motion but is itself unmoved. So, too, Anaxagoras is right when 
<A NAME="560"></A>he says that Mind is impassive and unmixed, since he makes it the principle 
<A NAME="561"></A>of motion: for it could cause motion in this sense only by being itself 
<A NAME="562"></A>unmoved, and have supreme control only by being unmixed.
<A NAME="563"></A><BR><BR>We will now take the second alternative. If the movement is not 
<A NAME="564"></A>accidentally but necessarily in motion-so that, if it were not in motion, 
<A NAME="565"></A>it would not move anything-then the movent, in so far as it is in motion, 
<A NAME="566"></A>must be in motion in one of two ways: it is moved either as that is which 
<A NAME="567"></A>is moved with the same kind of motion, or with a different kind-either 
<A NAME="568"></A>that which is heating, I mean, is itself in process of becoming hot, that 
<A NAME="569"></A>which is making healthy in process of becoming healthy, and that which 
<A NAME="570"></A>is causing locomotion in process of locomotion, or else that which is making 
<A NAME="571"></A>healthy is, let us say, in process of locomotion, and that which is causing 
<A NAME="572"></A>locomotion in process of, say, increase. But it is evident that this is 
<A NAME="573"></A>impossible. For if we adopt the first assumption we have to make it apply 
<A NAME="574"></A>within each of the very lowest species into which motion can be divided: 
<A NAME="575"></A>e.g. we must say that if some one is teaching some lesson in geometry, 
<A NAME="576"></A>he is also in process of being taught that same lesson in geometry, and 
<A NAME="577"></A>that if he is throwing he is in process of being thrown in just the same 
<A NAME="578"></A>manner. Or if we reject this assumption we must say that one kind of motion 
<A NAME="579"></A>is derived from another; e.g. that that which is causing locomotion is 
<A NAME="580"></A>in process of increase, that which is causing this increase is in process 
<A NAME="581"></A>of being altered by something else, and that which is causing this alteration 
<A NAME="582"></A>is in process of suffering some different kind of motion. But the series 
<A NAME="583"></A>must stop somewhere, since the kinds of motion are limited; and if we say 
<A NAME="584"></A>that the process is reversible, and that that which is causing alteration 
<A NAME="585"></A>is in process of locomotion, we do no more than if we had said at the outset 
<A NAME="586"></A>that that which is causing locomotion is in process of locomotion, and 
<A NAME="587"></A>that one who is teaching is in process of being taught: for it is clear 
<A NAME="588"></A>that everything that is moved is moved by the movent that is further back 
<A NAME="589"></A>in the series as well as by that which immediately moves it: in fact the 
<A NAME="590"></A>earlier movent is that which more strictly moves it. But this is of course 
<A NAME="591"></A>impossible: for it involves the consequence that one who is teaching is 
<A NAME="592"></A>in process of learning what he is teaching, whereas teaching necessarily 
<A NAME="593"></A>implies possessing knowledge, and learning not possessing it. Still more 
<A NAME="594"></A>unreasonable is the consequence involved that, since everything that is 
<A NAME="595"></A>moved is moved by something that is itself moved by something else, everything 
<A NAME="596"></A>that has a capacity for causing motion has as such a corresponding capacity 
<A NAME="597"></A>for being moved: i.e. it will have a capacity for being moved in the sense 
<A NAME="598"></A>in which one might say that everything that has a capacity for making healthy, 
<A NAME="599"></A>and exercises that capacity, has as such a capacity for being made healthy, 
<A NAME="600"></A>and that which has a capacity for building has as such a capacity for being 
<A NAME="601"></A>built. It will have the capacity for being thus moved either immediately 
<A NAME="602"></A>or through one or more links (as it will if, while everything that has 
<A NAME="603"></A>a capacity for causing motion has as such a capacity for being moved by 
<A NAME="604"></A>something else, the motion that it has the capacity for suffering is not 
<A NAME="605"></A>that with which it affects what is next to it, but a motion of a different 
<A NAME="606"></A>kind; e.g. that which has a capacity for making healthy might as such have 
<A NAME="607"></A>a capacity for learn. the series, however, could be traced back, as we 
<A NAME="608"></A>said before, until at some time or other we arrived at the same kind of 
<A NAME="609"></A>motion). Now the first alternative is impossible, and the second is fantastic: 
<A NAME="610"></A>it is absurd that that which has a capacity for causing alteration should 
<A NAME="611"></A>as such necessarily have a capacity, let us say, for increase. It is not 
<A NAME="612"></A>necessary, therefore, that that which is moved should always be moved by 
<A NAME="613"></A>something else that is itself moved by something else: so there will be 
<A NAME="614"></A>an end to the series. Consequently the first thing that is in motion will 
<A NAME="615"></A>derive its motion either from something that is at rest or from itself. 
<A NAME="616"></A>But if there were any need to consider which of the two, that which moves 
<A NAME="617"></A>itself or that which is moved by something else, is the cause and principle 
<A NAME="618"></A>of motion, every one would decide the former: for that which is itself 
<A NAME="619"></A>independently a cause is always prior as a cause to that which is so only 
<A NAME="620"></A>in virtue of being itself dependent upon something else that makes it 
<A NAME="621"></A>so.
<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>We must therefore make a fresh start and consider the question; 
<A NAME="623"></A>if a thing moves itself, in what sense and in what manner does it do so? 
<A NAME="624"></A>Now everything that is in motion must be infinitely divisible, for it has 
<A NAME="625"></A>been shown already in our general course on Physics, that everything that 
<A NAME="626"></A>is essentially in motion is continuous. Now it is impossible that that 
<A NAME="627"></A>which moves itself should in its entirety move itself: for then, while 
<A NAME="628"></A>being specifically one and indivisible, it would as a Whole both undergo 
<A NAME="629"></A>and cause the same locomotion or alteration: thus it would at the same 
<A NAME="630"></A>time be both teaching and being taught (the same thing), or both restoring 
<A NAME="631"></A>to and being restored to the same health. Moreover, we have established 
<A NAME="632"></A>the fact that it is the movable that is moved; and this is potentially, 
<A NAME="633"></A>not actually, in motion, but the potential is in process to actuality, 
<A NAME="634"></A>and motion is an incomplete actuality of the movable. The movent on the 
<A NAME="635"></A>other hand is already in activity: e.g. it is that which is hot that produces 
<A NAME="636"></A>heat: in fact, that which produces the form is always something that possesses 
<A NAME="637"></A>it. Consequently (if a thing can move itself as a whole), the same thing 
<A NAME="638"></A>in respect of the same thing may be at the same time both hot and not hot. 
<A NAME="639"></A>So, too, in every other case where the movent must be described by the 
<A NAME="640"></A>same name in the same sense as the moved. Therefore when a thing moves 
<A NAME="641"></A>itself it is one part of it that is the movent and another part that is 
<A NAME="642"></A>moved. But it is not self-moving in the sense that each of the two parts 
<A NAME="643"></A>is moved by the other part: the following considerations make this evident. 
<A NAME="644"></A>In the first place, if each of the two parts is to move the other, there 
<A NAME="645"></A>will be no first movent. If a thing is moved by a series of movents, that 
<A NAME="646"></A>which is earlier in the series is more the cause of its being moved than 
<A NAME="647"></A>that which comes next, and will be more truly the movent: for we found 
<A NAME="648"></A>that there are two kinds of movent, that which is itself moved by something 
<A NAME="649"></A>else and that which derives its motion from itself: and that which is further 
<A NAME="650"></A>from the thing that is moved is nearer to the principle of motion than 
<A NAME="651"></A>that which is intermediate. In the second place, there is no necessity 
<A NAME="652"></A>for the movent part to be moved by anything but itself: so it can only 
<A NAME="653"></A>be accidentally that the other part moves it in return. I take then the 
<A NAME="654"></A>possible case of its not moving it: then there will be a part that is moved 
<A NAME="655"></A>and a part that is an unmoved movent. In the third place, there is no necessity 
<A NAME="656"></A>for the movent to be moved in return: on the contrary the necessity that 
<A NAME="657"></A>there should always be motion makes it necessary that there should be some 
<A NAME="658"></A>movent that is either unmoved or moved by itself. In the fourth place we 
<A NAME="659"></A>should then have a thing undergoing the same motion that it is causing-that 
<A NAME="660"></A>which is producing heat, therefore, being heated. But as a matter of fact 
<A NAME="661"></A>that which primarily moves itself cannot contain either a single part that 
<A NAME="662"></A>moves itself or a number of parts each of which moves itself. For, if the 
<A NAME="663"></A>whole is moved by itself, it must be moved either by some part of itself 
<A NAME="664"></A>or as a whole by itself as a whole. If, then, it is moved in virtue of 
<A NAME="665"></A>some part of it being moved by that part itself, it is this part that will 
<A NAME="666"></A>be the primary self-movent, since, if this part is separated from the whole, 
<A NAME="667"></A>the part will still move itself, but the whole will do so no longer. If 
<A NAME="668"></A>on the other hand the whole is moved by itself as a whole, it must be accidentally 
<A NAME="669"></A>that the parts move themselves: and therefore, their self-motion not being 
<A NAME="670"></A>necessary, we may take the case of their not being moved by themselves. 
<A NAME="671"></A>Therefore in the whole of the thing we may distinguish that which imparts 
<A NAME="672"></A>motion without itself being moved and that which is moved: for only in 
<A NAME="673"></A>this way is it possible for a thing to be self-moved. Further, if the whole 
<A NAME="674"></A>moves itself we may distinguish in it that which imparts the motion and 
<A NAME="675"></A>that which is moved: so while we say that AB is moved by itself, we may 
<A NAME="676"></A>also say that it is moved by A. And since that which imparts motion may 
<A NAME="677"></A>be either a thing that is moved by something else or a thing that is unmoved, 
<A NAME="678"></A>and that which is moved may be either a thing that imparts motion to something 
<A NAME="679"></A>else or a thing that does not, that which moves itself must be composed 
<A NAME="680"></A>of something that is unmoved but imparts motion and also of something that 
<A NAME="681"></A>is moved but does not necessarily impart motion but may or may not do so. 
<A NAME="682"></A>Thus let A be something that imparts motion but is unmoved, B something 
<A NAME="683"></A>that is moved by A and moves G, G something that is moved by B but moves 
<A NAME="684"></A>nothing (granted that we eventually arrive at G we may take it that there 
<A NAME="685"></A>is only one intermediate term, though there may be more). Then the whole 
<A NAME="686"></A>ABG moves itself. But if I take away G, AB will move itself, A imparting 
<A NAME="687"></A>motion and B being moved, whereas G will not move itself or in fact be 
<A NAME="688"></A>moved at all. Nor again will BG move itself apart from A: for B imparts 
<A NAME="689"></A>motion only through being moved by something else, not through being moved 
<A NAME="690"></A>by any part of itself. So only AB moves itself. That which moves itself, 
<A NAME="691"></A>therefore, must comprise something that imparts motion but is unmoved and 
<A NAME="692"></A>something that is moved but does not necessarily move anything else: and 
<A NAME="693"></A>each of these two things, or at any rate one of them, must be in contact 
<A NAME="694"></A>with the other. If, then, that which imparts motion is a continuous substance-that 
<A NAME="695"></A>which is moved must of course be so-it is clear that it is not through 
<A NAME="696"></A>some part of the whole being of such a nature as to be capable of moving 
<A NAME="697"></A>itself that the whole moves itself: it moves itself as a whole, both being 
<A NAME="698"></A>moved and imparting motion through containing a part that imparts motion 
<A NAME="699"></A>and a part that is moved. It does not impart motion as a whole nor is it 
<A NAME="700"></A>moved as a whole: it is A alone that imparts motion and B alone that is 
<A NAME="701"></A>moved. It is not true, further, that G is moved by A, which is 
<A NAME="702"></A>impossible.
<A NAME="703"></A><BR><BR>Here a difficulty arises: if something is taken away from A (supposing 
<A NAME="704"></A>that that which imparts motion but is unmoved is a continuous substance), 
<A NAME="705"></A>or from B the part that is moved, will the remainder of A continue to impart 
<A NAME="706"></A>motion or the remainder of B continue to be moved? If so, it will not be 
<A NAME="707"></A>AB primarily that is moved by itself, since, when something is taken away 
<A NAME="708"></A>from AB, the remainder of AB will still continue to move itself. Perhaps 
<A NAME="709"></A>we may state the case thus: there is nothing to prevent each of the two 
<A NAME="710"></A>parts, or at any rate one of them, that which is moved, being divisible 
<A NAME="711"></A>though actually undivided, so that if it is divided it will not continue 
<A NAME="712"></A>in the possession of the same capacity: and so there is nothing to prevent 
<A NAME="713"></A>self-motion residing primarily in things that are potentially 
<A NAME="714"></A>divisible.
<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>From what has been said, then, it is evident that that which primarily 
<A NAME="716"></A>imparts motion is unmoved: for, whether the series is closed at once by 
<A NAME="717"></A>that which is in motion but moved by something else deriving its motion 
<A NAME="718"></A>directly from the first unmoved, or whether the motion is derived from 
<A NAME="719"></A>what is in motion but moves itself and stops its own motion, on both suppositions 
<A NAME="720"></A>we have the result that in all cases of things being in motion that which 
<A NAME="721"></A>primarily imparts motion is unmoved.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="722"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="723"></A><BR><BR>Since there must always be motion without intermission, there must 
<A NAME="724"></A>necessarily be something, one thing or it may be a plurality, that first 
<A NAME="725"></A>imparts motion, and this first movent must be unmoved. Now the question 
<A NAME="726"></A>whether each of the things that are unmoved but impart motion is eternal 
<A NAME="727"></A>is irrelevant to our present argument: but the following considerations 
<A NAME="728"></A>will make it clear that there must necessarily be some such thing, which, 
<A NAME="729"></A>while it has the capacity of moving something else, is itself unmoved and 
<A NAME="730"></A>exempt from all change, which can affect it neither in an unqualified nor 
<A NAME="731"></A>in an accidental sense. Let us suppose, if any one likes, that in the case 
<A NAME="732"></A>of certain things it is possible for them at different times to be and 
<A NAME="733"></A>not to be, without any process of becoming and perishing (in fact it would 
<A NAME="734"></A>seem to be necessary, if a thing that has not parts at one time is and 
<A NAME="735"></A>at another time is not, that any such thing should without undergoing any 
<A NAME="736"></A>process of change at one time be and at another time not be). And let us 
<A NAME="737"></A>further suppose it possible that some principles that are unmoved but capable 
<A NAME="738"></A>of imparting motion at one time are and at another time are not. Even so, 
<A NAME="739"></A>this cannot be true of all such principles, since there must clearly be 
<A NAME="740"></A>something that causes things that move themselves at one time to be and 
<A NAME="741"></A>at another not to be. For, since nothing that has not parts can be in motion, 
<A NAME="742"></A>that which moves itself must as a whole have magnitude, though nothing 
<A NAME="743"></A>that we have said makes this necessarily true of every movent. So the fact 
<A NAME="744"></A>that some things become and others perish, and that this is so continuously, 
<A NAME="745"></A>cannot be caused by any one of those things that, though they are unmoved, 
<A NAME="746"></A>do not always exist: nor again can it be caused by any of those which move 
<A NAME="747"></A>certain particular things, while others move other things. The eternity 
<A NAME="748"></A>and continuity of the process cannot be caused either by any one of them 
<A NAME="749"></A>singly or by the sum of them, because this causal relation must be eternal 
<A NAME="750"></A>and necessary, whereas the sum of these movents is infinite and they do 
<A NAME="751"></A>not all exist together. It is clear, then, that though there may be countless 
<A NAME="752"></A>instances of the perishing of some principles that are unmoved but impart 
<A NAME="753"></A>motion, and though many things that move themselves perish and are succeeded 
<A NAME="754"></A>by others that come into being, and though one thing that is unmoved moves 
<A NAME="755"></A>one thing while another moves another, nevertheless there is something 
<A NAME="756"></A>that comprehends them all, and that as something apart from each one of 
<A NAME="757"></A>them, and this it is that is the cause of the fact that some things are 
<A NAME="758"></A>and others are not and of the continuous process of change: and this causes 
<A NAME="759"></A>the motion of the other movents, while they are the causes of the motion 
<A NAME="760"></A>of other things. Motion, then, being eternal, the first movent, if there 
<A NAME="761"></A>is but one, will be eternal also: if there are more than one, there will 
<A NAME="762"></A>be a plurality of such eternal movents. We ought, however, to suppose that 
<A NAME="763"></A>there is one rather than many, and a finite rather than an infinite number. 
<A NAME="764"></A>When the consequences of either assumption are the same, we should always 
<A NAME="765"></A>assume that things are finite rather than infinite in number, since in 
<A NAME="766"></A>things constituted by nature that which is finite and that which is better 
<A NAME="767"></A>ought, if possible, to be present rather than the reverse: and here it 
<A NAME="768"></A>is sufficient to assume only one movent, the first of unmoved things, which 
<A NAME="769"></A>being eternal will be the principle of motion to everything 
<A NAME="770"></A>else.
<A NAME="771"></A><BR><BR>The following argument also makes it evident that the first movent 
<A NAME="772"></A>must be something that is one and eternal. We have shown that there must 
<A NAME="773"></A>always be motion. That being so, motion must also be continuous, because 
<A NAME="774"></A>what is always is continuous, whereas what is merely in succession is not 
<A NAME="775"></A>continuous. But further, if motion is continuous, it is one: and it is 
<A NAME="776"></A>one only if the movent and the moved that constitute it are each of them 
<A NAME="777"></A>one, since in the event of a thing's being moved now by one thing and now 
<A NAME="778"></A>by another the whole motion will not be continuous but 
<A NAME="779"></A>successive.
<A NAME="780"></A><BR><BR>Moreover a conviction that there is a first unmoved something may 
<A NAME="781"></A>be reached not only from the foregoing arguments, but also by considering 
<A NAME="782"></A>again the principles operative in movents. Now it is evident that among 
<A NAME="783"></A>existing things there are some that are sometimes in motion and sometimes 
<A NAME="784"></A>at rest. This fact has served above to make it clear that it is not true 
<A NAME="785"></A>either that all things are in motion or that all things are at rest or 
<A NAME="786"></A>that some things are always at rest and the remainder always in motion: 
<A NAME="787"></A>on this matter proof is supplied by things that fluctuate between the two 
<A NAME="788"></A>and have the capacity of being sometimes in motion and sometimes at rest. 
<A NAME="789"></A>The existence of things of this kind is clear to all: but we wish to explain 
<A NAME="790"></A>also the nature of each of the other two kinds and show that there are 
<A NAME="791"></A>some things that are always unmoved and some things that are always in 
<A NAME="792"></A>motion. In the course of our argument directed to this end we established 
<A NAME="793"></A>the fact that everything that is in motion is moved by something, and that 
<A NAME="794"></A>the movent is either unmoved or in motion, and that, if it is in motion, 
<A NAME="795"></A>it is moved either by itself or by something else and so on throughout 
<A NAME="796"></A>the series: and so we proceeded to the position that the first principle 
<A NAME="797"></A>that directly causes things that are in motion to be moved is that which 
<A NAME="798"></A>moves itself, and the first principle of the whole series is the unmoved. 
<A NAME="799"></A>Further it is evident from actual observation that there are things that 
<A NAME="800"></A>have the characteristic of moving themselves, e.g. the animal kingdom and 
<A NAME="801"></A>the whole class of living things. This being so, then, the view was suggested 
<A NAME="802"></A>that perhaps it may be possible for motion to come to be in a thing without 
<A NAME="803"></A>having been in existence at all before, because we see this actually occurring 
<A NAME="804"></A>in animals: they are unmoved at one time and then again they are in motion, 
<A NAME="805"></A>as it seems. We must grasp the fact, therefore, that animals move themselves 
<A NAME="806"></A>only with one kind of motion, and that this is not strictly originated 
<A NAME="807"></A>by them. The cause of it is not derived from the animal itself: it is connected 
<A NAME="808"></A>with other natural motions in animals, which they do not experience through 
<A NAME="809"></A>their own instrumentality, e.g. increase, decrease, and respiration: these 
<A NAME="810"></A>are experienced by every animal while it is at rest and not in motion in 
<A NAME="811"></A>respect of the motion set up by its own agency: here the motion is caused 
<A NAME="812"></A>by the atmosphere and by many things that enter into the animal: thus in 
<A NAME="813"></A>some cases the cause is nourishment: when it is being digested animals 
<A NAME="814"></A>sleep, and when it is being distributed through the system they awake and 
<A NAME="815"></A>move themselves, the first principle of this motion being thus originally 
<A NAME="816"></A>derived from outside. Therefore animals are not always in continuous motion 
<A NAME="817"></A>by their own agency: it is something else that moves them, itself being 
<A NAME="818"></A>in motion and changing as it comes into relation with each several thing 
<A NAME="819"></A>that moves itself. (Moreover in all these self-moving things the first 
<A NAME="820"></A>movent and cause of their self-motion is itself moved by itself, though 
<A NAME="821"></A>in an accidental sense: that is to say, the body changes its place, so 
<A NAME="822"></A>that that which is in the body changes its place also and is a self-movent 
<A NAME="823"></A>through its exercise of leverage.) Hence we may confidently conclude that 
<A NAME="824"></A>if a thing belongs to the class of unmoved movents that are also themselves 
<A NAME="825"></A>moved accidentally, it is impossible that it should cause continuous motion. 
<A NAME="826"></A>So the necessity that there should be motion continuously requires that 
<A NAME="827"></A>there should be a first movent that is unmoved even accidentally, if, as 
<A NAME="828"></A>we have said, there is to be in the world of things an unceasing and undying 
<A NAME="829"></A>motion, and the world is to remain permanently self-contained and within 
<A NAME="830"></A>the same limits: for if the first principle is permanent, the universe 
<A NAME="831"></A>must also be permanent, since it is continuous with the first principle. 
<A NAME="832"></A>(We must distinguish, however, between accidental motion of a thing by 
<A NAME="833"></A>itself and such motion by something else, the former being confined to 
<A NAME="834"></A>perishable things, whereas the latter belongs also to certain first principles 
<A NAME="835"></A>of heavenly bodies, of all those, that is to say, that experience more 
<A NAME="836"></A>than one locomotion.)
<A NAME="837"></A><BR><BR>And further, if there is always something of this nature, a movent 
<A NAME="838"></A>that is itself unmoved and eternal, then that which is first moved by it 
<A NAME="839"></A>must be eternal. Indeed this is clear also from the consideration that 
<A NAME="840"></A>there would otherwise be no becoming and perishing and no change of any 
<A NAME="841"></A>kind in other things, which require something that is in motion to move 
<A NAME="842"></A>them: for the motion imparted by the unmoved will always be imparted in 
<A NAME="843"></A>the same way and be one and the same, since the unmoved does not itself 
<A NAME="844"></A>change in relation to that which is moved by it. But that which is moved 
<A NAME="845"></A>by something that, though it is in motion, is moved directly by the unmoved 
<A NAME="846"></A>stands in varying relations to the things that it moves, so that the motion 
<A NAME="847"></A>that it causes will not be always the same: by reason of the fact that 
<A NAME="848"></A>it occupies contrary positions or assumes contrary forms at different times 
<A NAME="849"></A>it will produce contrary motions in each several thing that it moves and 
<A NAME="850"></A>will cause it to be at one time at rest and at another time in 
<A NAME="851"></A>motion.
<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR>The foregoing argument, then, has served to clear up the point 
<A NAME="853"></A>about which we raised a difficulty at the outset-why is it that instead 
<A NAME="854"></A>of all things being either in motion or at rest, or some things being always 
<A NAME="855"></A>in motion and the remainder always at rest, there are things that are sometimes 
<A NAME="856"></A>in motion and sometimes not? The cause of this is now plain: it is because, 
<A NAME="857"></A>while some things are moved by an eternal unmoved movent and are therefore 
<A NAME="858"></A>always in motion, other things are moved by a movent that is in motion 
<A NAME="859"></A>and changing, so that they too must change. But the unmoved movent, as 
<A NAME="860"></A>has been said, since it remains permanently simple and unvarying and in 
<A NAME="861"></A>the same state, will cause motion that is one and simple.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="862"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="863"></A><BR><BR>This matter will be made clearer, however, if we start afresh from 
<A NAME="864"></A>another point. We must consider whether it is or is not possible that there 
<A NAME="865"></A>should be a continuous motion, and, if it is possible, which this motion 
<A NAME="866"></A>is, and which is the primary motion: for it is plain that if there must 
<A NAME="867"></A>always be motion, and a particular motion is primary and continuous, then 
<A NAME="868"></A>it is this motion that is imparted by the first movent, and so it is necessarily 
<A NAME="869"></A>one and the same and continuous and primary.
<A NAME="870"></A><BR><BR>Now of the three kinds of motion that there are-motion in respect 
<A NAME="871"></A>of magnitude, motion in respect of affection, and motion in respect of 
<A NAME="872"></A>place-it is this last, which we call locomotion, that must be primary. 
<A NAME="873"></A>This may be shown as follows. It is impossible that there should be increase 
<A NAME="874"></A>without the previous occurrence of alteration: for that which is increased, 
<A NAME="875"></A>although in a sense it is increased by what is like itself, is in a sense 
<A NAME="876"></A>increased by what is unlike itself: thus it is said that contrary is nourishment 
<A NAME="877"></A>to contrary: but growth is effected only by things becoming like to like. 
<A NAME="878"></A>There must be alteration, then, in that there is this change from contrary 
<A NAME="879"></A>to contrary. But the fact that a thing is altered requires that there should 
<A NAME="880"></A>be something that alters it, something e.g. that makes the potentially 
<A NAME="881"></A>hot into the actually hot: so it is plain that the movent does not maintain 
<A NAME="882"></A>a uniform relation to it but is at one time nearer to and at another farther 
<A NAME="883"></A>from that which is altered: and we cannot have this without locomotion. 
<A NAME="884"></A>If, therefore, there must always be motion, there must also always be locomotion 
<A NAME="885"></A>as the primary motion, and, if there is a primary as distinguished from 
<A NAME="886"></A>a secondary form of locomotion, it must be the primary form. Again, all 
<A NAME="887"></A>affections have their origin in condensation and rarefaction: thus heavy 
<A NAME="888"></A>and light, soft and hard, hot and cold, are considered to be forms of density 
<A NAME="889"></A>and rarity. But condensation and rarefaction are nothing more than combination 
<A NAME="890"></A>and separation, processes in accordance with which substances are said 
<A NAME="891"></A>to become and perish: and in being combined and separated things must change 
<A NAME="892"></A>in respect of place. And further, when a thing is increased or decreased 
<A NAME="893"></A>its magnitude changes in respect of place.
<A NAME="894"></A><BR><BR>Again, there is another point of view from which it will be clearly 
<A NAME="895"></A>seen that locomotion is primary. As in the case of other things so too 
<A NAME="896"></A>in the case of motion the word 'primary' may be used in several senses. 
<A NAME="897"></A>A thing is said to be prior to other things when, if it does not exist, 
<A NAME="898"></A>the others will not exist, whereas it can exist without the others: and 
<A NAME="899"></A>there is also priority in time and priority in perfection of existence. 
<A NAME="900"></A>Let us begin, then, with the first sense. Now there must be motion continuously, 
<A NAME="901"></A>and there may be continuously either continuous motion or successive motion, 
<A NAME="902"></A>the former, however, in a higher degree than the latter: moreover it is 
<A NAME="903"></A>better that it should be continuous rather than successive motion, and 
<A NAME="904"></A>we always assume the presence in nature of the better, if it be possible: 
<A NAME="905"></A>since, then, continuous motion is possible (this will be proved later: 
<A NAME="906"></A>for the present let us take it for granted), and no other motion can be 
<A NAME="907"></A>continuous except locomotion, locomotion must be primary. For there is 
<A NAME="908"></A>no necessity for the subject of locomotion to be the subject either of 
<A NAME="909"></A>increase or of alteration, nor need it become or perish: on the other hand 
<A NAME="910"></A>there cannot be any one of these processes without the existence of the 
<A NAME="911"></A>continuous motion imparted by the first movent.
<A NAME="912"></A><BR><BR>Secondly, locomotion must be primary in time: for this is the only 
<A NAME="913"></A>motion possible for things. It is true indeed that, in the case of any 
<A NAME="914"></A>individual thing that has a becoming, locomotion must be the last of its 
<A NAME="915"></A>motions: for after its becoming it first experiences alteration and increase, 
<A NAME="916"></A>and locomotion is a motion that belongs to such things only when they are 
<A NAME="917"></A>perfected. But there must previously be something else that is in process 
<A NAME="918"></A>of locomotion to be the cause even of the becoming of things that become, 
<A NAME="919"></A>without itself being in process of becoming, as e.g. the begotten is preceded 
<A NAME="920"></A>by what begot it: otherwise becoming might be thought to be the primary 
<A NAME="921"></A>motion on the ground that the thing must first become. But though this 
<A NAME="922"></A>is so in the case of any individual thing that becomes, nevertheless before 
<A NAME="923"></A>anything becomes, something else must be in motion, not itself becoming 
<A NAME="924"></A>but being, and before this there must again be something else. And since 
<A NAME="925"></A>becoming cannot be primary-for, if it were, everything that is in motion 
<A NAME="926"></A>would be perishable-it is plain that no one of the motions next in order 
<A NAME="927"></A>can be prior to locomotion. By the motions next in order I mean increase 
<A NAME="928"></A>and then alteration, decrease, and perishing. All these are posterior to 
<A NAME="929"></A>becoming: consequently, if not even becoming is prior to locomotion, then 
<A NAME="930"></A>no one of the other processes of change is so either.
<A NAME="931"></A><BR><BR>Thirdly, that which is in process of becoming appears universally 
<A NAME="932"></A>as something imperfect and proceeding to a first principle: and so what 
<A NAME="933"></A>is posterior in the order of becoming is prior in the order of nature. 
<A NAME="934"></A>Now all things that go through the process of becoming acquire locomotion 
<A NAME="935"></A>last. It is this that accounts for the fact that some living things, e.g. 
<A NAME="936"></A>plants and many kinds of animals, owing to lack of the requisite organ, 
<A NAME="937"></A>are entirely without motion, whereas others acquire it in the course of 
<A NAME="938"></A>their being perfected. Therefore, if the degree in which things possess 
<A NAME="939"></A>locomotion corresponds to the degree in which they have realized their 
<A NAME="940"></A>natural development, then this motion must be prior to all others in respect 
<A NAME="941"></A>of perfection of existence: and not only for this reason but also because 
<A NAME="942"></A>a thing that is in motion loses its essential character less in the process 
<A NAME="943"></A>of locomotion than in any other kind of motion: it is the only motion that 
<A NAME="944"></A>does not involve a change of being in the sense in which there is a change 
<A NAME="945"></A>in quality when a thing is altered and a change in quantity when a thing 
<A NAME="946"></A>is increased or decreased. Above all it is plain that this motion, motion 
<A NAME="947"></A>in respect of place, is what is in the strictest sense produced by that 
<A NAME="948"></A>which moves itself; but it is the self-movent that we declare to be the 
<A NAME="949"></A>first principle of things that are moved and impart motion and the primary 
<A NAME="950"></A>source to which things that are in motion are to be 
<A NAME="951"></A>referred.
<A NAME="952"></A><BR><BR>It is clear, then, from the foregoing arguments that locomotion 
<A NAME="953"></A>is the primary motion. We have now to show which kind of locomotion is 
<A NAME="954"></A>primary. The same process of reasoning will also make clear at the same 
<A NAME="955"></A>time the truth of the assumption we have made both now and at a previous 
<A NAME="956"></A>stage that it is possible that there should be a motion that is continuous 
<A NAME="957"></A>and eternal. Now it is clear from the following considerations that no 
<A NAME="958"></A>other than locomotion can be continuous. Every other motion and change 
<A NAME="959"></A>is from an opposite to an opposite: thus for the processes of becoming 
<A NAME="960"></A>and perishing the limits are the existent and the non-existent, for alteration 
<A NAME="961"></A>the various pairs of contrary affections, and for increase and decrease 
<A NAME="962"></A>either greatness and smallness or perfection and imperfection of magnitude: 
<A NAME="963"></A>and changes to the respective contraries are contrary changes. Now a thing 
<A NAME="964"></A>that is undergoing any particular kind of motion, but though previously 
<A NAME="965"></A>existent has not always undergone it, must previously have been at rest 
<A NAME="966"></A>so far as that motion is concerned. It is clear, then, that for the changing 
<A NAME="967"></A>thing the contraries will be states of rest. And we have a similar result 
<A NAME="968"></A>in the case of changes that are not motions: for becoming and perishing, 
<A NAME="969"></A>whether regarded simply as such without qualification or as affecting something 
<A NAME="970"></A>in particular, are opposites: therefore provided it is impossible for a 
<A NAME="971"></A>thing to undergo opposite changes at the same time, the change will not 
<A NAME="972"></A>be continuous, but a period of time will intervene between the opposite 
<A NAME="973"></A>processes. The question whether these contradictory changes are contraries 
<A NAME="974"></A>or not makes no difference, provided only it is impossible for them both 
<A NAME="975"></A>to be present to the same thing at the same time: the point is of no importance 
<A NAME="976"></A>to the argument. Nor does it matter if the thing need not rest in the contradictory 
<A NAME="977"></A>state, or if there is no state of rest as a contrary to the process of 
<A NAME="978"></A>change: it may be true that the non-existent is not at rest, and that perishing 
<A NAME="979"></A>is a process to the non-existent. All that matters is the intervention 
<A NAME="980"></A>of a time: it is this that prevents the change from being continuous: so, 
<A NAME="981"></A>too, in our previous instances the important thing was not the relation 
<A NAME="982"></A>of contrariety but the impossibility of the two processes being present 
<A NAME="983"></A>to a thing at the same time. And there is no need to be disturbed by the 
<A NAME="984"></A>fact that on this showing there may be more than one contrary to the same 
<A NAME="985"></A>thing, that a particular motion will be contrary both to rest and to motion 
<A NAME="986"></A>in the contrary direction. We have only to grasp the fact that a particular 
<A NAME="987"></A>motion is in a sense the opposite both of a state of rest and of the contrary 
<A NAME="988"></A>motion, in the same way as that which is of equal or standard measure is 
<A NAME="989"></A>the opposite both of that which surpasses it and of that which it surpasses, 
<A NAME="990"></A>and that it is impossible for the opposite motions or changes to be present 
<A NAME="991"></A>to a thing at the same time. Furthermore, in the case of becoming and perishing 
<A NAME="992"></A>it would seem to be an utterly absurd thing if as soon as anything has 
<A NAME="993"></A>become it must necessarily perish and cannot continue to exist for any 
<A NAME="994"></A>time: and, if this is true of becoming and perishing, we have fair grounds 
<A NAME="995"></A>for inferring the same to be true of the other kinds of change, since it 
<A NAME="996"></A>would be in the natural order of things that they should be uniform in 
<A NAME="997"></A>this respect.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="998"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="999"></A><BR><BR>Let us now proceed to maintain that it is possible that there should 
<A NAME="1000"></A>be an infinite motion that is single and continuous, and that this motion 
<A NAME="1001"></A>is rotatory motion. The motion of everything that is in process of locomotion 
<A NAME="1002"></A>is either rotatory or rectilinear or a compound of the two: consequently, 
<A NAME="1003"></A>if one of the former two is not continuous, that which is composed of them 
<A NAME="1004"></A>both cannot be continuous either. Now it is plain that if the locomotion 
<A NAME="1005"></A>of a thing is rectilinear and finite it is not continuous locomotion: for 
<A NAME="1006"></A>the thing must turn back, and that which turns back in a straight line 
<A NAME="1007"></A>undergoes two contrary locomotions, since, so far as motion in respect 
<A NAME="1008"></A>of place is concerned, upward motion is the contrary of downward motion, 
<A NAME="1009"></A>forward motion of backward motion, and motion to the left of motion to 
<A NAME="1010"></A>the right, these being the pairs of contraries in the sphere of place. 
<A NAME="1011"></A>But we have already defined single and continuous motion to be motion of 
<A NAME="1012"></A>a single thing in a single period of time and operating within a sphere 
<A NAME="1013"></A>admitting of no further specific differentiation (for we have three things 
<A NAME="1014"></A>to consider, first that which is in motion, e.g. a man or a god, secondly 
<A NAME="1015"></A>the 'when' of the motion, that is to say, the time, and thirdly the sphere 
<A NAME="1016"></A>within which it operates, which may be either place or affection or essential 
<A NAME="1017"></A>form or magnitude): and contraries are specifically not one and the same 
<A NAME="1018"></A>but distinct: and within the sphere of place we have the above-mentioned 
<A NAME="1019"></A>distinctions. Moreover we have an indication that motion from A to B is 
<A NAME="1020"></A>the contrary of motion from B to A in the fact that, if they occur at the 
<A NAME="1021"></A>same time, they arrest and stop each other. And the same is true in the 
<A NAME="1022"></A>case of a circle: the motion from A towards B is the contrary of the motion 
<A NAME="1023"></A>from A towards G: for even if they are continuous and there is no turning 
<A NAME="1024"></A>back they arrest each other, because contraries annihilate or obstruct 
<A NAME="1025"></A>one another. On the other hand lateral motion is not the contrary of upward 
<A NAME="1026"></A>motion. But what shows most clearly that rectilinear motion cannot be continuous 
<A NAME="1027"></A>is the fact that turning back necessarily implies coming to a stand, not 
<A NAME="1028"></A>only when it is a straight line that is traversed, but also in the case 
<A NAME="1029"></A>of locomotion in a circle (which is not the same thing as rotatory locomotion: 
<A NAME="1030"></A>for, when a thing merely traverses a circle, it may either proceed on its 
<A NAME="1031"></A>course without a break or turn back again when it has reached the same 
<A NAME="1032"></A>point from which it started). We may assure ourselves of the necessity 
<A NAME="1033"></A>of this coming to a stand not only on the strength of observation, but 
<A NAME="1034"></A>also on theoretical grounds. We may start as follows: we have three points, 
<A NAME="1035"></A>starting-point, middle-point, and finishing-point, of which the middle-point 
<A NAME="1036"></A>in virtue of the relations in which it stands severally to the other two 
<A NAME="1037"></A>is both a starting-point and a finishing-point, and though numerically 
<A NAME="1038"></A>one is theoretically two. We have further the distinction between the potential 
<A NAME="1039"></A>and the actual. So in the straight line in question any one of the points 
<A NAME="1040"></A>lying between the two extremes is potentially a middle-point: but it is 
<A NAME="1041"></A>not actually so unless that which is in motion divides the line by coming 
<A NAME="1042"></A>to a stand at that point and beginning its motion again: thus the middle-point 
<A NAME="1043"></A>becomes both a starting-point and a goal, the starting-point of the latter 
<A NAME="1044"></A>part and the finishing-point of the first part of the motion. This is the 
<A NAME="1045"></A>case e.g. when A in the course of its locomotion comes to a stand at B 
<A NAME="1046"></A>and starts again towards G: but when its motion is continuous A cannot 
<A NAME="1047"></A>either have come to be or have ceased to be at the point B: it can only 
<A NAME="1048"></A>have been there at the moment of passing, its passage not being contained 
<A NAME="1049"></A>within any period of time except the whole of which the particular moment 
<A NAME="1050"></A>is a dividing-point. To maintain that it has come to be and ceased to be 
<A NAME="1051"></A>there will involve the consequence that A in the course of its locomotion 
<A NAME="1052"></A>will always be coming to a stand: for it is impossible that A should simultaneously 
<A NAME="1053"></A>have come to be at B and ceased to be there, so that the two things must 
<A NAME="1054"></A>have happened at different points of time, and therefore there will be 
<A NAME="1055"></A>the intervening period of time: consequently A will be in a state of rest 
<A NAME="1056"></A>at B, and similarly at all other points, since the same reasoning holds 
<A NAME="1057"></A>good in every case. When to A, that which is in process of locomotion, 
<A NAME="1058"></A>B, the middle-point, serves both as a finishing-point and as a starting-point 
<A NAME="1059"></A>for its motion, A must come to a stand at B, because it makes it two just 
<A NAME="1060"></A>as one might do in thought. However, the point A is the real starting-point 
<A NAME="1061"></A>at which the moving body has ceased to be, and it is at G that it has really 
<A NAME="1062"></A>come to be when its course is finished and it comes to a stand. So this 
<A NAME="1063"></A>is how we must meet the difficulty that then arises, which is as follows. 
<A NAME="1064"></A>Suppose the line E is equal to the line Z, that A proceeds in continuous 
<A NAME="1065"></A>locomotion from the extreme point of E to G, and that, at the moment when 
<A NAME="1066"></A>A is at the point B, D is proceeding in uniform locomotion and with the 
<A NAME="1067"></A>same velocity as A from the extremity of Z to H: then, says the argument, 
<A NAME="1068"></A>D will have reached H before A has reached G for that which makes an earlier 
<A NAME="1069"></A>start and departure must make an earlier arrival: the reason, then, for 
<A NAME="1070"></A>the late arrival of A is that it has not simultaneously come to be and 
<A NAME="1071"></A>ceased to be at B: otherwise it will not arrive later: for this to happen 
<A NAME="1072"></A>it will be necessary that it should come to a stand there. Therefore we 
<A NAME="1073"></A>must not hold that there was a moment when A came to be at B and that at 
<A NAME="1074"></A>the same moment D was in motion from the extremity of Z: for the fact of 
<A NAME="1075"></A>A's having come to be at B will involve the fact of its also ceasing to 
<A NAME="1076"></A>be there, and the two events will not be simultaneous, whereas the truth 
<A NAME="1077"></A>is that A is at B at a s
