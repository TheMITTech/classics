<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part I</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>We have now considered the varieties of the deliberative or supreme power 
<A NAME="12"></A>in states, and the various arrangements of law-courts and state offices, 
<A NAME="13"></A>and which of them are adapted to different forms of government. We have 
<A NAME="14"></A>also spoken of the destruction and preservation of constitutions, how and 
<A NAME="15"></A>from what causes they arise.
<A NAME="16"></A><BR><BR>Of democracy and all other forms of government there are many kinds; 
<A NAME="17"></A>and it will be well to assign to them severally the modes of organization 
<A NAME="18"></A>which are proper and advantageous to each, adding what remains to be said 
<A NAME="19"></A>about them. Moreover, we ought to consider the various combinations of 
<A NAME="20"></A>these modes themselves; for such combinations make constitutions overlap 
<A NAME="21"></A>one another, so that aristocracies have an oligarchical character, and 
<A NAME="22"></A>constitutional governments incline to democracies.
<A NAME="23"></A><BR><BR>When I speak of the combinations which remain to be considered, 
<A NAME="24"></A>and thus far have not been considered by us, I mean such as these: when 
<A NAME="25"></A>the deliberative part of the government and the election of officers is 
<A NAME="26"></A>constituted oligarchically, and the law-courts aristocratically, or when 
<A NAME="27"></A>the courts and the deliberative part of the state are oligarchical, and 
<A NAME="28"></A>the election to office aristocratical, or when in any other way there is 
<A NAME="29"></A>a want of harmony in the composition of a state.
<A NAME="30"></A><BR><BR>I have shown already what forms of democracy are suited to particular 
<A NAME="31"></A>cities, and what of oligarchy to particular peoples, and to whom each of 
<A NAME="32"></A>the other forms of government is suited. Further, we must not only show 
<A NAME="33"></A>which of these governments is the best for each state, but also briefly 
<A NAME="34"></A>proceed to consider how these and other forms of government are to be 
<A NAME="35"></A>established.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>First of all let us speak of democracy, which will also bring to 
<A NAME="37"></A>light the opposite form of government commonly called oligarchy. For the 
<A NAME="38"></A>purposes of this inquiry we need to ascertain all the elements and characteristics 
<A NAME="39"></A>of democracy, since from the combinations of these the varieties of democratic 
<A NAME="40"></A>government arise. There are several of these differing from each other, 
<A NAME="41"></A>and the difference is due to two causes. One (1) has been already mentioned- 
<A NAME="42"></A>differences of population; for the popular element may consist of husbandmen, 
<A NAME="43"></A>or of mechanics, or of laborers, and if the first of these be added to 
<A NAME="44"></A>the second, or the third to the two others, not only does the democracy 
<A NAME="45"></A>become better or worse, but its very nature is changed. A second cause 
<A NAME="46"></A>(2) remains to be mentioned: the various properties and characteristics 
<A NAME="47"></A>of democracy, when variously combined, make a difference. For one democracy 
<A NAME="48"></A>will have less and another will have more, and another will have all of 
<A NAME="49"></A>these characteristics. There is an advantage in knowing them all, whether 
<A NAME="50"></A>a man wishes to establish some new form of democracy, or only to remodel 
<A NAME="51"></A>an existing one. Founders of states try to bring together all the elements 
<A NAME="52"></A>which accord with the ideas of the several constitutions; but this is a 
<A NAME="53"></A>mistake of theirs, as I have already remarked when speaking of the destruction 
<A NAME="54"></A>and preservation of states. We will now set forth the principles, characteristics, 
<A NAME="55"></A>and aims of such states.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="56"></A><B>Part II</B>

<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>The basis of a democratic state is liberty; which, according to 
<A NAME="58"></A>the common opinion of men, can only be enjoyed in such a state; this they 
<A NAME="59"></A>affirm to be the great end of every democracy. One principle of liberty 
<A NAME="60"></A>is for all to rule and be ruled in turn, and indeed democratic justice 
<A NAME="61"></A>is the application of numerical not proportionate equality; whence it follows 
<A NAME="62"></A>that the majority must be supreme, and that whatever the majority approve 
<A NAME="63"></A>must be the end and the just. Every citizen, it is said, must have equality, 
<A NAME="64"></A>and therefore in a democracy the poor have more power than the rich, because 
<A NAME="65"></A>there are more of them, and the will of the majority is supreme. This, 
<A NAME="66"></A>then, is one note of liberty which all democrats affirm to be the principle 
<A NAME="67"></A>of their state. Another is that a man should live as he likes. This, they 
<A NAME="68"></A>say, is the privilege of a freeman, since, on the other hand, not to live 
<A NAME="69"></A>as a man likes is the mark of a slave. This is the second characteristic 
<A NAME="70"></A>of democracy, whence has arisen the claim of men to be ruled by none, if 
<A NAME="71"></A>possible, or, if this is impossible, to rule and be ruled in turns; and 
<A NAME="72"></A>so it contributes to the freedom based upon equality.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Such being our foundation and such the principle from which we 
<A NAME="74"></A>start, the characteristics of democracy are as follows the election of 
<A NAME="75"></A>officers by all out of all; and that all should rule over each, and each 
<A NAME="76"></A>in his turn over all; that the appointment to all offices, or to all but 
<A NAME="77"></A>those which require experience and skill, should be made by lot; that no 
<A NAME="78"></A>property qualification should be required for offices, or only a very low 
<A NAME="79"></A>one; that a man should not hold the same office twice, or not often, or 
<A NAME="80"></A>in the case of few except military offices: that the tenure of all offices, 
<A NAME="81"></A>or of as many as possible, should be brief, that all men should sit in 
<A NAME="82"></A>judgment, or that judges selected out of all should judge, in all matters, 
<A NAME="83"></A>or in most and in the greatest and most important- such as the scrutiny 
<A NAME="84"></A>of accounts, the constitution, and private contracts; that the assembly 
<A NAME="85"></A>should be supreme over all causes, or at any rate over the most important, 
<A NAME="86"></A>and the magistrates over none or only over a very few. Of all magistracies, 
<A NAME="87"></A>a council is the most democratic when there is not the means of paying 
<A NAME="88"></A>all the citizens, but when they are paid even this is robbed of its power; 
<A NAME="89"></A>for the people then draw all cases to themselves, as I said in the previous 
<A NAME="90"></A>discussion. The next characteristic of democracy is payment for services; 
<A NAME="91"></A>assembly, law courts, magistrates, everybody receives pay, when it is to 
<A NAME="92"></A>be had; or when it is not to be had for all, then it is given to the law-courts 
<A NAME="93"></A>and to the stated assemblies, to the council and to the magistrates, or 
<A NAME="94"></A>at least to any of them who are compelled to have their meals together. 
<A NAME="95"></A>And whereas oligarchy is characterized by birth, wealth, and education, 
<A NAME="96"></A>the notes of democracy appear to be the opposite of these- low birth, poverty, 
<A NAME="97"></A>mean employment. Another note is that no magistracy is perpetual, but if 
<A NAME="98"></A>any such have survived some ancient change in the constitution it should 
<A NAME="99"></A>be stripped of its power, and the holders should be elected by lot and 
<A NAME="100"></A>no longer by vote. These are the points common to all democracies; but 
<A NAME="101"></A>democracy and demos in their truest form are based upon the recognized 
<A NAME="102"></A>principle of democratic justice, that all should count equally; for equality 
<A NAME="103"></A>implies that the poor should have no more share in the government than 
<A NAME="104"></A>the rich, and should not be the only rulers, but that all should rule equally 
<A NAME="105"></A>according to their numbers. And in this way men think that they will secure 
<A NAME="106"></A>equality and freedom in their state.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="107"></A><B>Part III</B>

<A NAME="108"></A><BR><BR>Next comes the question, how is this equality to be obtained? Are 
<A NAME="109"></A>we to assign to a thousand poor men the property qualifications of five 
<A NAME="110"></A>hundred rich men? and shall we give the thousand a power equal to that 
<A NAME="111"></A>of the five hundred? or, if this is not to be the mode, ought we, still 
<A NAME="112"></A>retaining the same ratio, to take equal numbers from each and give them 
<A NAME="113"></A>the control of the elections and of the courts?- Which, according to the 
<A NAME="114"></A>democratical notion, is the juster form of the constitution- this or one 
<A NAME="115"></A>based on numbers only? Democrats say that justice is that to which the 
<A NAME="116"></A>majority agree, oligarchs that to which the wealthier class; in their opinion 
<A NAME="117"></A>the decision should be given according to the amount of property. In both 
<A NAME="118"></A>principles there is some inequality and injustice. For if justice is the 
<A NAME="119"></A>will of the few, any one person who has more wealth than all the rest of 
<A NAME="120"></A>the rich put together, ought, upon the oligarchical principle, to have 
<A NAME="121"></A>the sole power- but this would be tyranny; or if justice is the will of 
<A NAME="122"></A>the majority, as I was before saying, they will unjustly confiscate the 
<A NAME="123"></A>property of the wealthy minority. To find a principle of equality which 
<A NAME="124"></A>they both agree we must inquire into their respective ideas of 
<A NAME="125"></A>justice.
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>Now they agree in saying that whatever is decided by the majority 
<A NAME="127"></A>of the citizens is to be deemed law. Granted: but not without some reserve; 
<A NAME="128"></A>since there are two classes out of which a state is composed- the poor 
<A NAME="129"></A>and the rich- that is to be deemed law, on which both or the greater part 
<A NAME="130"></A>of both agree; and if they disagree, that which is approved by the greater 
<A NAME="131"></A>number, and by those who have the higher qualification. For example, suppose 
<A NAME="132"></A>that there are ten rich and twenty poor, and some measure is approved by 
<A NAME="133"></A>six of the rich and is disapproved by fifteen of the poor, and the remaining 
<A NAME="134"></A>four of the rich join with the party of the poor, and the remaining five 
<A NAME="135"></A>of the poor with that of the rich; in such a case the will of those whose 
<A NAME="136"></A>qualifications, when both sides are added up, are the greatest, should 
<A NAME="137"></A>prevail. If they turn out to be equal, there is no greater difficulty than 
<A NAME="138"></A>at present, when, if the assembly or the courts are divided, recourse is 
<A NAME="139"></A>had to the lot, or to some similar expedient. But, although it may be difficult 
<A NAME="140"></A>in theory to know what is just and equal, the practical difficulty of inducing 
<A NAME="141"></A>those to forbear who can, if they like, encroach, is far greater, for the 
<A NAME="142"></A>weaker are always asking for equality and justice, but the stronger care 
<A NAME="143"></A>for none of these things.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="144"></A><B>Part IV</B>

<A NAME="145"></A><BR><BR>Of the four kinds of democracy, as was said in the in the previous 
<A NAME="146"></A>discussion, the best is that which comes first in order; it is also the 
<A NAME="147"></A>oldest of them all. I am speaking of them according to the natural classification 
<A NAME="148"></A>of their inhabitants. For the best material of democracy is an agricultural 
<A NAME="149"></A>population; there is no difficulty in forming a democracy where the mass 
<A NAME="150"></A>of the people live by agriculture or tending of cattle. Being poor, they 
<A NAME="151"></A>have no leisure, and therefore do not often attend the assembly, and not 
<A NAME="152"></A>having the necessaries of life they are always at work, and do not covet 
<A NAME="153"></A>the property of others. Indeed, they find their employment pleasanter than 
<A NAME="154"></A>the cares of government or office where no great gains can be made out 
<A NAME="155"></A>of them, for the many are more desirous of gain than of honor. A proof 
<A NAME="156"></A>is that even the ancient tyrannies were patiently endured by them, as they 
<A NAME="157"></A>still endure oligarchies, if they are allowed to work and are not deprived 
<A NAME="158"></A>of their property; for some of them grow quickly rich and the others are 
<A NAME="159"></A>well enough off. Moreover, they have the power of electing the magistrates 
<A NAME="160"></A>and calling them to account; their ambition, if they have any, is thus 
<A NAME="161"></A>satisfied; and in some democracies, although they do not all share in the 
<A NAME="162"></A>appointment of offices, except through representatives elected in turn 
<A NAME="163"></A>out of the whole people, as at Mantinea; yet, if they have the power of 
<A NAME="164"></A>deliberating, the many are contented. Even this form of government may 
<A NAME="165"></A>be regarded as a democracy, and was such at Mantinea. Hence it is both 
<A NAME="166"></A>expedient and customary in the aforementioned type of democracy that all 
<A NAME="167"></A>should elect to offices, and conduct scrutinies, and sit in the law-courts, 
<A NAME="168"></A>but that the great offices should be filled up by election and from persons 
<A NAME="169"></A>having a qualification; the greater requiring a greater qualification, 
<A NAME="170"></A>or, if there be no offices for which a qualification is required, then 
<A NAME="171"></A>those who are marked out by special ability should be appointed. Under 
<A NAME="172"></A>such a form of government the citizens are sure to be governed well (for 
<A NAME="173"></A>the offices will always be held by the best persons; the people are willing 
<A NAME="174"></A>enough to elect them and are not jealous of the good). The good and the 
<A NAME="175"></A>notables will then be satisfied, for they will not be governed by men who 
<A NAME="176"></A>are their inferiors, and the persons elected will rule justly, because 
<A NAME="177"></A>others will call them to account. Every man should be responsible to others, 
<A NAME="178"></A>nor should any one be allowed to do just as he pleases; for where absolute 
<A NAME="179"></A>freedom is allowed, there is nothing to restrain the evil which is inherent 
<A NAME="180"></A>in every man. But the principle of responsibility secures that which is 
<A NAME="181"></A>the greatest good in states; the right persons rule and are prevented from 
<A NAME="182"></A>doing wrong, and the people have their due. It is evident that this is 
<A NAME="183"></A>the best kind of democracy, and why? Because the people are drawn from 
<A NAME="184"></A>a certain class. Some of the ancient laws of most states were, all of them, 
<A NAME="185"></A>useful with a view to making the people husbandmen. They provided either 
<A NAME="186"></A>that no one should possess more than a certain quantity of land, or that, 
<A NAME="187"></A>if he did, the land should not be within a certain distance from the town 
<A NAME="188"></A>or the acropolis. Formerly in many states there was a law forbidding any 
<A NAME="189"></A>one to sell his original allotment of land. There is a similar law attributed 
<A NAME="190"></A>to Oxylus, which is to the effect that there should be a certain portion 
<A NAME="191"></A>of every man's land on which he could not borrow money. A useful corrective 
<A NAME="192"></A>to the evil of which I am speaking would be the law of the Aphytaeans, 
<A NAME="193"></A>who, although they are numerous, and do not possess much land, are all 
<A NAME="194"></A>of them husbandmen. For their properties are reckoned in the census; not 
<A NAME="195"></A>entire, but only in such small portions that even the poor may have more 
<A NAME="196"></A>than the amount required.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>Next best to an agricultural, and in many respects similar, are 
<A NAME="198"></A>a pastoral people, who live by their flocks; they are the best trained 
<A NAME="199"></A>of any for war, robust in body and able to camp out. The people of whom 
<A NAME="200"></A>other democracies consist are far inferior to them, for their life is inferior; 
<A NAME="201"></A>there is no room for moral excellence in any of their employments, whether 
<A NAME="202"></A>they be mechanics or traders or laborers. Besides, people of this class 
<A NAME="203"></A>can readily come to the assembly, because they are continually moving about 
<A NAME="204"></A>in the city and in the agora; whereas husbandmen are scattered over the 
<A NAME="205"></A>country and do not meet, or equally feel the want of assembling together. 
<A NAME="206"></A>Where the territory also happens to extend to a distance from the city, 
<A NAME="207"></A>there is no difficulty in making an excellent democracy or constitutional 
<A NAME="208"></A>government; for the people are compelled to settle in the country, and 
<A NAME="209"></A>even if there is a town population the assembly ought not to meet, in democracies, 
<A NAME="210"></A>when the country people cannot come. We have thus explained how the first 
<A NAME="211"></A>and best form of democracy should be constituted; it is clear that the 
<A NAME="212"></A>other or inferior sorts will deviate in a regular order, and the population 
<A NAME="213"></A>which is excluded will at each stage be of a lower kind.
<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>The last form of democracy, that in which all share alike, is one 
<A NAME="215"></A>which cannot be borne by all states, and will not last long unless well 
<A NAME="216"></A>regulated by laws and customs. The more general causes which tend to destroy 
<A NAME="217"></A>this or other kinds of government have been pretty fully considered. In 
<A NAME="218"></A>order to constitute such a democracy and strengthen the people, the leaders 
<A NAME="219"></A>have been in the habit including as many as they can, and making citizens 
<A NAME="220"></A>not only of those who are legitimate, but even of the illegitimate, and 
<A NAME="221"></A>of those who have only one parent a citizen, whether father or mother; 
<A NAME="222"></A>for nothing of this sort comes amiss to such a democracy. This is the way 
<A NAME="223"></A>in which demagogues proceed. Whereas the right thing would be to make no 
<A NAME="224"></A>more additions when the number of the commonalty exceeds that of the notables 
<A NAME="225"></A>and of the middle class- beyond this not to go. When in excess of this 
<A NAME="226"></A>point, the constitution becomes disorderly, and the notables grow excited 
<A NAME="227"></A>and impatient of the democracy, as in the insurrection at Cyrene; for no 
<A NAME="228"></A>notice is taken of a little evil, but when it increases it strikes the 
<A NAME="229"></A>eye. Measures like those which Cleisthenes passed when he wanted to increase 
<A NAME="230"></A>the power of the democracy at Athens, or such as were taken by the founders 
<A NAME="231"></A>of popular government at Cyrene, are useful in the extreme form of democracy. 
<A NAME="232"></A>Fresh tribes and brotherhoods should be established; the private rites 
<A NAME="233"></A>of families should be restricted and converted into public ones; in short, 
<A NAME="234"></A>every contrivance should be adopted which will mingle the citizens with 
<A NAME="235"></A>one another and get rid of old connections. Again, the measures which are 
<A NAME="236"></A>taken by tyrants appear all of them to be democratic; such, for instance, 
<A NAME="237"></A>as the license permitted to slaves (which may be to a certain extent advantageous) 
<A NAME="238"></A>and also that of women and children, and the aflowing everybody to live 
<A NAME="239"></A>as he likes. Such a government will have many supporters, for most persons 
<A NAME="240"></A>would rather live in a disorderly than in a sober manner.

<A NAME="242"></A><BR><BR>The mere establishment of a democracy is not the only or principal 
<A NAME="243"></A>business of the legislator, or of those who wish to create such a state, 
<A NAME="244"></A>for any state, however badly constituted, may last one, two, or three days; 
<A NAME="245"></A>a far greater difficulty is the preservation of it. The legislator should 
<A NAME="246"></A>therefore endeavor to have a firm foundation according to the principles 
<A NAME="247"></A>already laid down concerning the preservation and destruction of states; 
<A NAME="248"></A>he should guard against the destructive elements, and should make laws, 
<A NAME="249"></A>whether written or unwritten, which will contain all the preservatives 
<A NAME="250"></A>of states. He must not think the truly democratical or oligarchical measure 
<A NAME="251"></A>to be that which will give the greatest amount of democracy or oligarchy, 
<A NAME="252"></A>but that which will make them last longest. The demagogues of our own day 
<A NAME="253"></A>often get property confiscated in the law-courts in order to please the 
<A NAME="254"></A>people. But those who have the welfare of the state at heart should counteract 
<A NAME="255"></A>them, and make a law that the property of the condemned should not be public 
<A NAME="256"></A>and go into the treasury but be sacred. Thus offenders will be as much 
<A NAME="257"></A>afraid, for they will be punished all the same, and the people, having 
<A NAME="258"></A>nothing to gain, will not be so ready to condemn the accused. Care should 
<A NAME="259"></A>also be taken that state trials are as few as possible, and heavy penalties 
<A NAME="260"></A>should be inflicted on those who bring groundless accusations; for it is 
<A NAME="261"></A>the practice to indict, not members of the popular party, but the notables, 
<A NAME="262"></A>although the citizens ought to be all attached to the constitution as well, 
<A NAME="263"></A>or at any rate should not regard their rulers as enemies.
<A NAME="264"></A><BR><BR>Now, since in the last and worst form of democracy the citizens 
<A NAME="265"></A>are very numerous, and can hardly be made to assemble unless they are paid, 
<A NAME="266"></A>and to pay them when there are no revenues presses hardly upon the notables 
<A NAME="267"></A>(for the money must be obtained by a property tax and confiscations and 
<A NAME="268"></A>corrupt practices of the courts, things which have before now overthrown 
<A NAME="269"></A>many democracies); where, I say, there are no revenues, the government 
<A NAME="270"></A>should hold few assemblies, and the law-courts should consist of many persons, 
<A NAME="271"></A>but sit for a few days only. This system has two advantages: first, the 
<A NAME="272"></A>rich do not fear the expense, even although they are unpaid themselves 
<A NAME="273"></A>when the poor are paid; and secondly, causes are better tried, for wealthy 
<A NAME="274"></A>persons, although they do not like to be long absent from their own affairs, 
<A NAME="275"></A>do not mind going for a few days to the law-courts. Where there are revenues 
<A NAME="276"></A>the demagogues should not be allowed after their manner to distribute the 
<A NAME="277"></A>surplus; the poor are always receiving and always wanting more and more, 
<A NAME="278"></A>for such help is like water poured into a leaky cask. Yet the true friend 
<A NAME="279"></A>of the people should see that they be not too poor, for extreme poverty 
<A NAME="280"></A>lowers the character of the democracy; measures therefore should be taken 
<A NAME="281"></A>which will give them lasting prosperity; and as this is equally the interest 
<A NAME="282"></A>of all classes, the proceeds of the public revenues should be accumulated 
<A NAME="283"></A>and distributed among its poor, if possible, in such quantities as may 
<A NAME="284"></A>enable them to purchase a little farm, or, at any rate, make a beginning 
<A NAME="285"></A>in trade or husbandry. And if this benevolence cannot be extended to all, 
<A NAME="286"></A>money should be distributed in turn according to tribes or other divisions, 
<A NAME="287"></A>and in the meantime the rich should pay the fee for the attendance of the 
<A NAME="288"></A>poor at the necessary assemblies; and should in return be excused from 
<A NAME="289"></A>useless public services. By administering the state in this spirit the 
<A NAME="290"></A>Carthaginians retain the affections of the people; their policy is from 
<A NAME="291"></A>time to time to send some of them into their dependent towns, where they 
<A NAME="292"></A>grow rich. It is also worthy of a generous and sensible nobility to divide 
<A NAME="293"></A>the poor amongst them, and give them the means of going to work. The example 
<A NAME="294"></A>of the people of Tarentum is also well deserving of imitation, for, by 
<A NAME="295"></A>sharing the use of their own property with the poor, they gain their good 
<A NAME="296"></A>will. Moreover, they divide all their offices into two classes, some of 
<A NAME="297"></A>them being elected by vote, the others by lot; the latter, that the people 
<A NAME="298"></A>may participate in them, and the former, that the state may be better administered. 
<A NAME="299"></A>A like result may be gained by dividing the same offices, so as to have 
<A NAME="300"></A>two classes of magistrates, one chosen by vote, the other by 
<A NAME="301"></A>lot.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>Enough has been said of the manner in which democracies ought to 
<A NAME="303"></A>be constituted.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="304"></A><B>Part VI</B>

<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>From these considerations there will be no difficulty in seeing 
<A NAME="306"></A>what should be the constitution of oligarchies. We have only to reason 
<A NAME="307"></A>from opposites and compare each form of oligarchy with the corresponding 
<A NAME="308"></A>form of democracy.
<A NAME="309"></A><BR><BR>The first and best attempered of oligarchies is akin to a constitutional 
<A NAME="310"></A>government. In this there ought to be two standards of qualification; the 
<A NAME="311"></A>one high, the other low- the lower qualifying for the humbler yet indispensable 
<A NAME="312"></A>offices and the higher for the superior ones. He who acquires the prescribed 
<A NAME="313"></A>qualification should have the rights of citizenship. The number of those 
<A NAME="314"></A>admitted should be such as will make the entire governing body stronger 
<A NAME="315"></A>than those who are excluded, and the new citizen should be always taken 
<A NAME="316"></A>out of the better class of the people. The principle, narrowed a little, 
<A NAME="317"></A>gives another form of oligarchy; until at length we reach the most cliquish 
<A NAME="318"></A>and tyrannical of them all, answering to the extreme democracy, which, 
<A NAME="319"></A>being the worst, requires vigilance in proportion to its badness. For as 
<A NAME="320"></A>healthy bodies and ships well provided with sailors may undergo many mishaps 
<A NAME="321"></A>and survive them, whereas sickly constitutions and rotten ill-manned ships 
<A NAME="322"></A>are ruined by the very least mistake, so do the worst forms of government 
<A NAME="323"></A>require the greatest care. The populousness of democracies generally preserves 
<A NAME="324"></A>them (for e state need not be much increased,since there is no necessity 
<A NAME="325"></A>tha number is to democracy in the place of justice based on proportion); 
<A NAME="326"></A>whereas the preservation of an oligarchy clearly depends on an opposite 
<A NAME="327"></A>principle, viz., good order.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="328"></A><B>Part VII</B>

<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>As there are four chief divisions of the common people- husbandmen, 
<A NAME="330"></A>mechanics, retail traders, laborers; so also there are four kinds of military 
<A NAME="331"></A>forces- the cavalry, the heavy infantry, the light armed troops, the navy. 
<A NAME="332"></A>When the country is adapted for cavalry, then a strong oligarchy is likely 
<A NAME="333"></A>to be established. For the security of the inhabitants depends upon a force 
<A NAME="334"></A>of this sort, and only rich men can afford to keep horses. The second form 
<A NAME="335"></A>of oligarchy prevails when the country is adapted to heavy infantry; for 
<A NAME="336"></A>this service is better suited to the rich than to the poor. But the light-armed 
<A NAME="337"></A>and the naval element are wholly democratic; and nowadays, where they are 
<A NAME="338"></A>numerous, if the two parties quarrel, the oligarchy are often worsted by 
<A NAME="339"></A>them in the struggle. A remedy for this state of things may be found in 
<A NAME="340"></A>the practice of generals who combine a proper contingent of light-armed 
<A NAME="341"></A>troops with cavalry and heavy-armed. And this is the way in which the poor 
<A NAME="342"></A>get the better of the rich in civil contests; being lightly armed, they 
<A NAME="343"></A>fight with advantage against cavalry and heavy being lightly armed, they 
<A NAME="344"></A>fight with advantage against cavalry and heavy infantry. An oligarchy which 
<A NAME="345"></A>raises such a force out of the lower classes raises a power against itself. 
<A NAME="346"></A>And therefore, since the ages of the citizens vary and some are older and 
<A NAME="347"></A>some younger, the fathers should have their own sons, while they are still 
<A NAME="348"></A>young, taught the agile movements of light-armed troops; and these, when 
<A NAME="349"></A>they have been taken out of the ranks of the youth, should become light-armed 
<A NAME="350"></A>warriors in reality. The oligarchy should also yield a share in the government 
<A NAME="351"></A>to the people, either, as I said before, to those who have a property qualification, 
<A NAME="352"></A>or, as in the case of Thebes, to those who have abstained for a certain 
<A NAME="353"></A>number of years from mean employments, or, as at Massalia, to men of merit 
<A NAME="354"></A>who are selected for their worthiness, whether previously citizens or not. 
<A NAME="355"></A>The magistracies of the highest rank, which ought to be in the hands of 
<A NAME="356"></A>the governing body, should have expensive duties attached to them, and 
<A NAME="357"></A>then the people will not desire them and will take no offense at the privileges 
<A NAME="358"></A>of their rulers when they see that they pay a heavy fine for their dignity. 
<A NAME="359"></A>It is fitting also that the magistrates on entering office should offer 
<A NAME="360"></A>magnificent sacrifices or erect some public edifice, and then the people 
<A NAME="361"></A>who participate in the entertainments, and see the city decorated with 
<A NAME="362"></A>votive offerings and buildings, will not desire an alteration in the government, 
<A NAME="363"></A>and the notables will have memorials of their munificence. This, however, 
<A NAME="364"></A>is anything but the fashion of our modern oligarchs, who are as covetous 
<A NAME="365"></A>of gain as they are of honor; oligarchies like theirs may be well described 
<A NAME="366"></A>as petty democracies. Enough of the manner in which democracies and oligarchies 
<A NAME="367"></A>should be organized.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="368"></A><B>Part VIII</B>

<A NAME="369"></A><BR><BR>Next in order follows the right distribution of offices, their 
<A NAME="370"></A>number, their nature, their duties, of which indeed we have already spoken. 
<A NAME="371"></A>No state can exist not having the necessary offices, and no state can be 
<A NAME="372"></A>well administered not having the offices which tend to preserve harmony 
<A NAME="373"></A>and good order. In small states, as we have already remarked, there must 
<A NAME="374"></A>not be many of them, but in larger there must be a larger number, and we 
<A NAME="375"></A>should carefully consider which offices may properly be united and which 
<A NAME="376"></A>separated.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>First among necessary offices is that which has the care of the 
<A NAME="378"></A>market; a magistrate should be appointed to inspect contracts and to maintain 
<A NAME="379"></A>order. For in every state there must inevitably be buyers and sellers who 
<A NAME="380"></A>will supply one another's wants; this is the readiest way to make a state 
<A NAME="381"></A>self-sufficing and so fulfill the purpose for which men come together into 
<A NAME="382"></A>one state. A second office of a similar kind undertakes the supervision 
<A NAME="383"></A>and embellishment of public and private buildings, the maintaining and 
<A NAME="384"></A>repairing of houses and roads, the prevention of disputes about boundaries, 
<A NAME="385"></A>and other concerns of a like nature. This is commonly called the office 
<A NAME="386"></A>of City Warden, and has various departments, which, in more populous towns, 
<A NAME="387"></A>are shared among different persons, one, for example, taking charge of 
<A NAME="388"></A>the walls, another of the fountains, a third of harbors. There is another 
<A NAME="389"></A>equally necessary office, and of a similar kind, having to do with the 
<A NAME="390"></A>same matters without the walls and in the country- the magistrates who 
<A NAME="391"></A>hold this office are called Wardens of the country, or Inspectors of the 
<A NAME="392"></A>woods. Besides these three there is a fourth office of receivers of taxes, 
<A NAME="393"></A>who have under their charge the revenue which is distributed among the 
<A NAME="394"></A>various departments; these are called Receivers or Treasurers. Another 
<A NAME="395"></A>officer registers all private contracts, and decisions of the courts, all 
<A NAME="396"></A>public indictments, and also all preliminary proceedings. This office again 
<A NAME="397"></A>is sometimes subdivided, in which case one officer is appointed over all 
<A NAME="398"></A>the rest. These officers are called Recorders or Sacred Recorders, Presidents, 
<A NAME="399"></A>and the like.
<A NAME="400"></A><BR><BR>Next to these comes an office of which the duties are the most 
<A NAME="401"></A>necessary and also the most difficult, viz., that to which is committed 
<A NAME="402"></A>the execution of punishments, or the exaction of fines from those who are 
<A NAME="403"></A>posted up according to the registers; and also the custody of prisoners. 
<A NAME="404"></A>The difficulty of this office arises out of the odium which is attached 
<A NAME="405"></A>to it; no one will undertake it unless great profits are to be made, and 
<A NAME="406"></A>any one who does is loath to execute the law. Still the office is necessary; 
<A NAME="407"></A>for judicial decisions are useless if they take no effect; and if society 
<A NAME="408"></A>cannot exist without them, neither can it exist without the execution of 
<A NAME="409"></A>them. It is an office which, being so unpopular, should not be entrusted 
<A NAME="410"></A>to one person, but divided among several taken from different courts. In 
<A NAME="411"></A>like manner an effort should be made to distribute among different persons 
<A NAME="412"></A>the writing up of those who are on the register of public debtors. Some 
<A NAME="413"></A>sentences should be executed by the magistrates also, and in particular 
<A NAME="414"></A>penalties due to the outgoing magistrates should be exacted by the incoming 
<A NAME="415"></A>ones; and as regards those due to magistrates already in office, when one 
<A NAME="416"></A>court has given judgement, another should exact the penalty; for example, 
<A NAME="417"></A>the wardens of the city should exact the fines imposed by the wardens of 
<A NAME="418"></A>the agora, and others again should exact the fines imposed by them. For 
<A NAME="419"></A>penalties are more likely to be exacted when less odium attaches to the 
<A NAME="420"></A>exaction of them; but a double odium is incurred when the judges who have 
<A NAME="421"></A>passed also execute the sentence, and if they are always the executioners, 
<A NAME="422"></A>they will be the enemies of all.
<A NAME="423"></A><BR><BR>In many places, while one magistracy executes the sentence, another 
<A NAME="424"></A>has the custody of the prisoners, as, for example, 'the Eleven' at Athens. 
<A NAME="425"></A>It is well to separate off the jailorship also, and try by some device 
<A NAME="426"></A>to render the office less unpopular. For it is quite as necessary as that 
<A NAME="427"></A>of the executioners; but good men do all they can to avoid it, and worthless 
<A NAME="428"></A>persons cannot safely be trusted with it; for they themselves require a 
<A NAME="429"></A>guard, and are not fit to guard others. There ought not therefore to be 
<A NAME="430"></A>a single or permanent officer set apart for this duty; but it should be 
<A NAME="431"></A>entrusted to the young, wherever they are organized into a band or guard, 
<A NAME="432"></A>and different magistrates acting in turn should take charge of 
<A NAME="433"></A>it.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>These are the indispensable officers, and should be ranked first; 
<A NAME="435"></A>next in order follow others, equally necessary, but of higher rank, and 
<A NAME="436"></A>requiring great experience and fidelity. Such are the officers to which 
<A NAME="437"></A>are committed the guard of the city, and other military functions. Not 
<A NAME="438"></A>only in time of war but of peace their duty will be to defend the walls 
<A NAME="439"></A>and gates, and to muster and marshal the citizens. In some states there 
<A NAME="440"></A>are many such offices; in others there are a few only, while small states 
<A NAME="441"></A>are content with one; these officers are called generals or commanders. 
<A NAME="442"></A>Again, if a state has cavalry or light-armed troops or archers or a naval 
<A NAME="443"></A>force, it will sometimes happen that each of these departments has separate 
<A NAME="444"></A>officers, who are called admirals, or generals of cavalry or of light-armed 
<A NAME="445"></A>troops. And there are subordinate officers called naval captains, and captains 
<A NAME="446"></A>of light-armed troops and of horse; having others under them: all these 
<A NAME="447"></A>are included in the department of war. Thus much of military 
<A NAME="448"></A>command.
<A NAME="449"></A><BR><BR>But since many, not to say all, of these offices handle the public 
<A NAME="450"></A>money, there must of necessity be another office which examines and audits 
<A NAME="451"></A>them, and has no other functions. Such officers are called by various names- 
<A NAME="452"></A>Scrutineers, Auditors, Accountants, Controllers. Besides all these offices 
<A NAME="453"></A>there is another which is supreme over them, and to this is often entrusted 
<A NAME="454"></A>both the introduction and the ratification of measures, or at all events 
<A NAME="455"></A>it presides, in a democracy, over the assembly. For there must be a body 
<A NAME="456"></A>which convenes the supreme authority in the state. In some places they 
<A NAME="457"></A>are called 'probuli,' because they hold previous deliberations, but in 
<A NAME="458"></A>a democracy more commonly 'councillors.' These are the chief political 
<A NAME="459"></A>offices.
<A NAME="460"></A><BR><BR>Another set of officers is concerned with the maintenance of religion 
<A NAME="461"></A>priests and guardians see to the preservation and repair of the temples 
<A NAME="462"></A>of the Gods and to other matters of religion. One office of this sort may 
<A NAME="463"></A>be enough in small places, but in larger ones there are a great many besides 
<A NAME="464"></A>the priesthood; for example, superintendents of public worship, guardians 
<A NAME="465"></A>of shrines, treasurers of the sacred revenues. Nearly connected with these 
<A NAME="466"></A>there are also the officers appointed for the performance of the public 
<A NAME="467"></A>sacrifices, except any which the law assigns to the priests; such sacrifices 
<A NAME="468"></A>derive their dignity from the public hearth of the city. They are sometimes 
<A NAME="469"></A>called archons, sometimes kings, and sometimes prytanes.
<A NAME="470"></A><BR><BR>These, then, are the necessary offices, which may be summed up 
<A NAME="471"></A>as follows: offices concerned with matters of religion, with war, with 
<A NAME="472"></A>the revenue and expenditure, with the market, with the city, with the harbors, 
<A NAME="473"></A>with the country; also with the courts of law, with the records of contracts, 
<A NAME="474"></A>with execution of sentences, with custody of prisoners, with audits and 
<A NAME="475"></A>scrutinies and accounts of magistrates; lastly, there are those which preside 
<A NAME="476"></A>over the public deliberations of the state. There are likewise magistracies 
<A NAME="477"></A>characteristic of states which are peaceful and prosperous, and at the 
<A NAME="478"></A>same time have a regard to good order: such as the offices of guardians 
<A NAME="479"></A>of women, guardians of the law, guardians of children, and directors of 
<A NAME="480"></A>gymnastics; also superintendents of gymnastic and Dionysiac contests, and 
<A NAME="481"></A>of other similar spectacles. Some of these are clearly not democratic offices; 
<A NAME="482"></A>for example, the guardianships of women and children- the poor, not having 
<A NAME="483"></A>any slaves, must employ both their women and children as 
<A NAME="484"></A>servants.
<A NAME="485"></A><BR><BR>Once more: there are three offices according to whose directions 
<A NAME="486"></A>the highest magistrates are chosen in certain states- guardians of the 
<A NAME="487"></A>law, probuli, councillors- of these, the guardians of the law are an aristocratical, 
<A NAME="488"></A>the probuli an oligarchical, the council a democratical institution. Enough 
<A NAME="489"></A>of the different kinds of offices.
