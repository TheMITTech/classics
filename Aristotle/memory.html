<BR><BR>
<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>

<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>We have, in the next place, to treat of Memory and Remembering, considering 
<A NAME="12"></A>its nature, its cause, and the part of the soul to which this experience, 
<A NAME="13"></A>as well as that of Recollecting, belongs. For the persons who possess a 
<A NAME="14"></A>retentive memory are not identical with those who excel in power of recollection; 
<A NAME="15"></A>indeed, as a rule, slow people have a good memory, whereas those who are 
<A NAME="16"></A>quick-witted and clever are better at recollecting.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>We must first form a true conception of these objects of memory, 
<A NAME="18"></A>a point on which mistakes are often made. Now to remember the future is 
<A NAME="19"></A>not possible, but this is an object of opinion or expectation (and indeed 
<A NAME="20"></A>there might be actually a science of expectation, like that of divination, 
<A NAME="21"></A>in which some believe); nor is there memory of the present, but only sense-perception. 
<A NAME="22"></A>For by the latter we know not the future, nor the past, but the present 
<A NAME="23"></A>only. But memory relates to the past. No one would say that he remembers 
<A NAME="24"></A>the present, when it is present, e.g. a given white object at the moment 
<A NAME="25"></A>when he sees it; nor would one say that he remembers an object of scientific 
<A NAME="26"></A>contemplation at the moment when he is actually contemplating it, and has 
<A NAME="27"></A>it full before his mind;-of the former he would say only that he perceives 
<A NAME="28"></A>it, of the latter only that he knows it. But when one has scientific knowledge, 
<A NAME="29"></A>or perception, apart from the actualizations of the faculty concerned, 
<A NAME="30"></A>he thus 'remembers' (that the angles of a triangle are together equal to 
<A NAME="31"></A>two right angles); as to the former, that he learned it, or thought it 
<A NAME="32"></A>out for himself, as to the latter, that he heard, or saw, it, or had some 
<A NAME="33"></A>such sensible experience of it. For whenever one exercises the faculty 
<A NAME="34"></A>of remembering, he must say within himself, 'I formerly heard (or otherwise 
<A NAME="35"></A>perceived) this,' or 'I formerly had this thought'.
<A NAME="36"></A><BR><BR>Memory is, therefore, neither Perception nor Conception, but a 
<A NAME="37"></A>state or affection of one of these, conditioned by lapse of time. As already 
<A NAME="38"></A>observed, there is no such thing as memory of the present while present, 
<A NAME="39"></A>for the present is object only of perception, and the future, of expectation, 
<A NAME="40"></A>but the object of memory is the past. All memory, therefore, implies a 
<A NAME="41"></A>time elapsed; consequently only those animals which perceive time remember, 
<A NAME="42"></A>and the organ whereby they perceive time is also that whereby they 
<A NAME="43"></A>remember.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>The subject of 'presentation' has been already considered in our 
<A NAME="45"></A>work On the Soul. Without a presentation intellectual activity is impossible. 
<A NAME="46"></A>For there is in such activity an incidental affection identical with one 
<A NAME="47"></A>also incidental in geometrical demonstrations. For in the latter case, 
<A NAME="48"></A>though we do not for the purpose of the proof make any use of the fact 
<A NAME="49"></A>that the quantity in the triangle (for example, which we have drawn) is 
<A NAME="50"></A>determinate, we nevertheless draw it determinate in quantity. So likewise 
<A NAME="51"></A>when one exerts the intellect (e.g. on the subject of first principles), 
<A NAME="52"></A>although the object may not be quantitative, one envisages it as quantitative, 
<A NAME="53"></A>though he thinks it in abstraction from quantity; while, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="54"></A>if the object of the intellect is essentially of the class of things that 
<A NAME="55"></A>are quantitative, but indeterminate, one envisages it as if it had determinate 
<A NAME="56"></A>quantity, though subsequently, in thinking it, he abstracts from its determinateness. 
<A NAME="57"></A>Why we cannot exercise the intellect on any object absolutely apart from 
<A NAME="58"></A>the continuous, or apply it even to non-temporal things unless in connexion 
<A NAME="59"></A>with time, is another question. Now, one must cognize magnitude and motion 
<A NAME="60"></A>by means of the same faculty by which one cognizes time (i.e. by that which 
<A NAME="61"></A>is also the faculty of memory), and the presentation (involved in such 
<A NAME="62"></A>cognition) is an affection of the sensus communis; whence this follows, 
<A NAME="63"></A>viz. that the cognition of these objects (magnitude, motion time) is effected 
<A NAME="64"></A>by the (said sensus communis, i.e. the) primary faculty of perception. 
<A NAME="65"></A>Accordingly, memory (not merely of sensible, but) even of intellectual 
<A NAME="66"></A>objects involves a presentation: hence we may conclude that it belongs 
<A NAME="67"></A>to the faculty of intelligence only incidentally, while directly and essentially 
<A NAME="68"></A>it belongs to the primary faculty of sense-perception.
<A NAME="69"></A><BR><BR>Hence not only human beings and the beings which possess opinion 
<A NAME="70"></A>or intelligence, but also certain other animals, possess memory. If memory 
<A NAME="71"></A>were a function of (pure) intellect, it would not have been as it is an 
<A NAME="72"></A>attribute of many of the lower animals, but probably, in that case, no 
<A NAME="73"></A>mortal beings would have had memory; since, even as the case stands, it 
<A NAME="74"></A>is not an attribute of them all, just because all have not the faculty 
<A NAME="75"></A>of perceiving time. Whenever one actually remembers having seen or heard, 
<A NAME="76"></A>or learned, something, he includes in this act (as we have already observed) 
<A NAME="77"></A>the consciousness of 'formerly'; and the distinction of 'former' and 'latter' 
<A NAME="78"></A>is a distinction in time.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>Accordingly if asked, of which among the parts of the soul memory 
<A NAME="80"></A>is a function, we reply: manifestly of that part to which 'presentation' 
<A NAME="81"></A>appertains; and all objects capable of being presented (viz. aistheta) 
<A NAME="82"></A>are immediately and properly objects of memory, while those (viz. noeta) 
<A NAME="83"></A>which necessarily involve (but only involve) presentation are objects of 
<A NAME="84"></A>memory incidentally.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>One might ask how it is possible that though the affection (the 
<A NAME="86"></A>presentation) alone is present, and the (related) fact absent, the latter-that 
<A NAME="87"></A>which is not present-is remembered. (The question arises), because it is 
<A NAME="88"></A>clear that we must conceive that which is generated through sense-perception 
<A NAME="89"></A>in the sentient soul, and in the part of the body which is its seat-viz. 
<A NAME="90"></A>that affection the state whereof we call memory-to be some such thing as 
<A NAME="91"></A>a picture. The process of movement (sensory stimulation) involved the act 
<A NAME="92"></A>of perception stamps in, as it were, a sort of impression of the percept, 
<A NAME="93"></A>just as persons do who make an impression with a seal. This explains why, 
<A NAME="94"></A>in those who are strongly moved owing to passion, or time of life, no mnemonic 
<A NAME="95"></A>impression is formed; just as no impression would be formed if the movement 
<A NAME="96"></A>of the seal were to impinge on running water; while there are others in 
<A NAME="97"></A>whom, owing to the receiving surface being frayed, as happens to (the stucco 
<A NAME="98"></A>on) old (chamber) walls, or owing to the hardness of the receiving surface, 
<A NAME="99"></A>the requisite impression is not implanted at all. Hence both very young 
<A NAME="100"></A>and very old persons are defective in memory; they are in a state of flux, 
<A NAME="101"></A>the former because of their growth, the latter, owing to their decay. In 
<A NAME="102"></A>like manner, also, both those who are too quick and those who are too slow 
<A NAME="103"></A>have bad memories. The former are too soft, the latter too hard (in the 
<A NAME="104"></A>texture of their receiving organs), so that in the case of the former the 
<A NAME="105"></A>presented image (though imprinted) does not remain in the soul, while on 
<A NAME="106"></A>the latter it is not imprinted at all.
<A NAME="107"></A><BR><BR>But then, if this truly describes what happens in the genesis of 
<A NAME="108"></A>memory, (the question stated above arises:) when one remembers, is it this 
<A NAME="109"></A>impressed affection that he remembers, or is it the objective thing from 
<A NAME="110"></A>which this was derived? If the former, it would follow that we remember 
<A NAME="111"></A>nothing which is absent; if the latter, how is it possible that, though 
<A NAME="112"></A>perceiving directly only the impression, we remember that absent thing 
<A NAME="113"></A>which we do not perceive? Granted that there is in us something like an 
<A NAME="114"></A>impression or picture, why should the perception of the mere impression 
<A NAME="115"></A>be memory of something else, instead of being related to this impression 
<A NAME="116"></A>alone? For when one actually remembers, this impression is what he contemplates, 
<A NAME="117"></A>and this is what he perceives. How then does he remember what is not present? 
<A NAME="118"></A>One might as well suppose it possible also to see or hear that which is 
<A NAME="119"></A>not present. In reply, we suggest that this very thing is quite conceivable, 
<A NAME="120"></A>nay, actually occurs in experience. A picture painted on a panel is at 
<A NAME="121"></A>once a picture and a likeness: that is, while one and the same, it is both 
<A NAME="122"></A>of these, although the 'being' of both is not the same, and one may contemplate 
<A NAME="123"></A>it either as a picture, or as a likeness. Just in the same way we have 
<A NAME="124"></A>to conceive that the mnemonic presentation within us is something which 
<A NAME="125"></A>by itself is merely an object of contemplation, while, in-relation to something 
<A NAME="126"></A>else, it is also a presentation of that other thing. In so far as it is 
<A NAME="127"></A>regarded in itself, it is only an object of contemplation, or a presentation; 
<A NAME="128"></A>but when considered as relative to something else, e.g. as its likeness, 
<A NAME="129"></A>it is also a mnemonic token. Hence, whenever the residual sensory process 
<A NAME="130"></A>implied by it is actualized in consciousness, if the soul perceives this 
<A NAME="131"></A>in so far as it is something absolute, it appears to occur as a mere thought 
<A NAME="132"></A>or presentation; but if the soul perceives it qua related to something 
<A NAME="133"></A>else, then,-just as when one contemplates the painting in the picture as 
<A NAME="134"></A>being a likeness, and without having (at the moment) seen the actual Koriskos, 
<A NAME="135"></A>contemplates it as a likeness of Koriskos, and in that case the experience 
<A NAME="136"></A>involved in this contemplation of it (as relative) is different from what 
<A NAME="137"></A>one has when he contemplates it simply as a painted figure-(so in the case 
<A NAME="138"></A>of memory we have the analogous difference for), of the objects in the 
<A NAME="139"></A>soul, the one (the unrelated object) presents itself simply as a thought, 
<A NAME="140"></A>but the other (the related object) just because, as in the painting, it 
<A NAME="141"></A>is a likeness, presents itself as a mnemonic token.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>We can now understand why it is that sometimes, when we have such 
<A NAME="143"></A>processes, based on some former act of perception, occurring in the soul, 
<A NAME="144"></A>we do not know whether this really implies our having had perceptions corresponding 
<A NAME="145"></A>to them, and we doubt whether the case is or is not one of memory. But 
<A NAME="146"></A>occasionally it happens that (while thus doubting) we get a sudden idea 
<A NAME="147"></A>and recollect that we heard or saw something formerly. This (occurrence 
<A NAME="148"></A>of the 'sudden idea') happens whenever, from contemplating a mental object 
<A NAME="149"></A>as absolute, one changes his point of view, and regards it as relative 
<A NAME="150"></A>to something else.
<A NAME="151"></A><BR><BR>The opposite (sc. to the case of those who at first do not recognize 
<A NAME="152"></A>their phantasms as mnemonic) also occurs, as happened in the cases of Antipheron 
<A NAME="153"></A>of Oreus and others suffering from mental derangement; for they were accustomed 
<A NAME="154"></A>to speak of their mere phantasms as facts of their past experience, and 
<A NAME="155"></A>as if remembering them. This takes place whenever one contemplates what 
<A NAME="156"></A>is not a likeness as if it were a likeness.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Mnemonic exercises aim at preserving one's memory of something 
<A NAME="158"></A>by repeatedly reminding him of it; which implies nothing else (on the learner's 
<A NAME="159"></A>part) than the frequent contemplation of something (viz. the 'mnemonic', 
<A NAME="160"></A>whatever it may be) as a likeness, and not as out of 
<A NAME="161"></A>relation.
<A NAME="162"></A><BR><BR>As regards the question, therefore, what memory or remembering 
<A NAME="163"></A>is, it has now been shown that it is the state of a presentation, related 
<A NAME="164"></A>as a likeness to that of which it is a presentation; and as to the question 
<A NAME="165"></A>of which of the faculties within us memory is a function, (it has been 
<A NAME="166"></A>shown) that it is a function of the primary faculty of sense-perception, 
<A NAME="167"></A>i.e. of that faculty whereby we perceive time.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="168"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>Next comes the subject of Recollection, in dealing with which we 
<A NAME="170"></A>must assume as fundamental the truths elicited above in our introductory 
<A NAME="171"></A>discussions. For recollection is not the 'recovery' or 'acquisition' of 
<A NAME="172"></A>memory; since at the instant when one at first learns (a fact of science) 
<A NAME="173"></A>or experiences (a particular fact of sense), he does not thereby 'recover' 
<A NAME="174"></A>a memory, inasmuch as none has preceded, nor does he acquire one ab initio. 
<A NAME="175"></A>It is only at the instant when the aforesaid state or affection (of the 
<A NAME="176"></A>aisthesis or upolepsis) is implanted in the soul that memory exists, and 
<A NAME="177"></A>therefore memory is not itself implanted concurrently with the continuous 
<A NAME="178"></A>implantation of the (original) sensory experience.
<A NAME="179"></A><BR><BR><B>Further:</B> at the very individual and concluding instant when 
<A NAME="180"></A>first (the sensory experience or scientific knowledge) has been completely 
<A NAME="181"></A>implanted, there is then already established in the person affected the 
<A NAME="182"></A>(sensory) affection, or the scientific knowledge (if one ought to apply 
<A NAME="183"></A>the term 'scientific knowledge' to the (mnemonic) state or affection; and 
<A NAME="184"></A>indeed one may well remember, in the 'incidental' sense, some of the things 
<A NAME="185"></A>(i.e. ta katholou) which are properly objects of scientific knowledge); 
<A NAME="186"></A>but to remember, strictly and properly speaking, is an activity which will 
<A NAME="187"></A>not be immanent until the original experience has undergone lapse of time. 
<A NAME="188"></A>For one remembers now what one saw or otherwise experienced formerly; the 
<A NAME="189"></A>moment of the original experience and the moment of the memory of it are 
<A NAME="190"></A>never identical.
<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>Again, (even when time has elapsed, and one can be said really 
<A NAME="192"></A>to have acquired memory, this is not necessarily recollection, for firstly) 
<A NAME="193"></A>it is obviously possible, without any present act of recollection, to remember 
<A NAME="194"></A>as a continued consequence of the original perception or other experience; 
<A NAME="195"></A>whereas when (after an interval of obliviscence) one recovers some scientific 
<A NAME="196"></A>knowledge which he had before, or some perception, or some other experience, 
<A NAME="197"></A>the state of which we above declared to be memory, it is then, and then 
<A NAME="198"></A>only, that this recovery may amount to a recollection of any of the things 
<A NAME="199"></A>aforesaid. But, (though as observed above, remembering does not necessarily 
<A NAME="200"></A>imply recollecting), recollecting always implies remembering, and actualized 
<A NAME="201"></A>memory follows (upon the successful act of recollecting).
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>But secondly, even the assertion that recollection is the reinstatement 
<A NAME="203"></A>in consciousness of something which was there before but had disappeared 
<A NAME="204"></A>requires qualification. This assertion may be true, but it may also be 
<A NAME="205"></A>false; for the same person may twice learn (from some teacher), or twice 
<A NAME="206"></A>discover (i.e. excogitate), the same fact. Accordingly, the act of recollecting 
<A NAME="207"></A>ought (in its definition) to be distinguished from these acts; i.e. recollecting 
<A NAME="208"></A>must imply in those who recollect the presence of some spring over and 
<A NAME="209"></A>above that from which they originally learn.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>Acts of recollection, as they occur in experience, are due to the 
<A NAME="211"></A>fact that one movement has by nature another that succeeds it in regular 
<A NAME="212"></A>order.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>If this order be necessary, whenever a subject experiences the 
<A NAME="214"></A>former of two movements thus connected, it will (invariably) experience 
<A NAME="215"></A>the latter; if, however, the order be not necessary, but customary, only 
<A NAME="216"></A>in the majority of cases will the subject experience the latter of the 
<A NAME="217"></A>two movements. But it is a fact that there are some movements, by a single 
<A NAME="218"></A>experience of which persons take the impress of custom more deeply than 
<A NAME="219"></A>they do by experiencing others many times; hence upon seeing some things 
<A NAME="220"></A>but once we remember them better than others which we may have been 
<A NAME="221"></A>frequently.
<A NAME="222"></A><BR><BR>Whenever therefore, we are recollecting, we are experiencing certain 
<A NAME="223"></A>of the antecedent movements until finally we experience the one after which 
<A NAME="224"></A>customarily comes that which we seek. This explains why we hunt up the 
<A NAME="225"></A>series (of kineseis) having started in thought either from a present intuition 
<A NAME="226"></A>or some other, and from something either similar, or contrary, to what 
<A NAME="227"></A>we seek, or else from that which is contiguous with it. Such is the empirical 
<A NAME="228"></A>ground of the process of recollection; for the mnemonic movements involved 
<A NAME="229"></A>in these starting-points are in some cases identical, in others, again, 
<A NAME="230"></A>simultaneous, with those of the idea we seek, while in others they comprise 
<A NAME="231"></A>a portion of them, so that the remnant which one experienced after that 
<A NAME="232"></A>portion (and which still requires to be excited in memory) is comparatively 
<A NAME="233"></A>small.
<A NAME="234"></A><BR><BR>Thus, then, it is that persons seek to recollect, and thus, too, 
<A NAME="235"></A>it is that they recollect even without the effort of seeking to do so, 
<A NAME="236"></A>viz. when the movement implied in recollection has supervened on some other 
<A NAME="237"></A>which is its condition. For, as a rule, it is when antecedent movements 
<A NAME="238"></A>of the classes here described have first been excited, that the particular 
<A NAME="239"></A>movement implied in recollection follows. We need not examine a series 
<A NAME="240"></A>of which the beginning and end lie far apart, in order to see how (by recollection) 
<A NAME="241"></A>we remember; one in which they lie near one another will serve equally 
<A NAME="242"></A>well. For it is clear that the method is in each case the same, that is, 
<A NAME="243"></A>one hunts up the objective series, without any previous search or previous 
<A NAME="244"></A>recollection. For (there is, besides the natural order, viz. the order 
<A NAME="245"></A>of the pralmata, or events of the primary experience, also a customary 
<A NAME="246"></A>order, and) by the effect of custom the mnemonic movements tend to succeed 
<A NAME="247"></A>one another in a certain order. Accordingly, therefore, when one wishes 
<A NAME="248"></A>to recollect, this is what he will do: he will try to obtain a beginning 
<A NAME="249"></A>of movement whose sequel shall be the movement which he desires to reawaken. 
<A NAME="250"></A>This explains why attempts at recollection succeed soonest and best when 
<A NAME="251"></A>they start from a beginning (of some objective series). For, in order of 
<A NAME="252"></A>succession, the mnemonic movements are to one another as the objective 
<A NAME="253"></A>facts (from which they are derived). Accordingly, things arranged in a 
<A NAME="254"></A>fixed order, like the successive demonstrations in geometry, are easy to 
<A NAME="255"></A>remember (or recollect) while badly arranged subjects are remembered with 
<A NAME="256"></A>difficulty.
<A NAME="257"></A><BR><BR>Recollecting differs also in this respect from relearning, that 
<A NAME="258"></A>one who recollects will be able, somehow, to move, solely by his own effort, 
<A NAME="259"></A>to the term next after the starting-point. When one cannot do this of himself, 
<A NAME="260"></A>but only by external assistance, he no longer remembers (i.e. he has totally 
<A NAME="261"></A>forgotten, and therefore of course cannot recollect). It often happens 
<A NAME="262"></A>that, though a person cannot recollect at the moment, yet by seeking he 
<A NAME="263"></A>can do so, and discovers what he seeks. This he succeeds in doing by setting 
<A NAME="264"></A>up many movements, until finally he excites one of a kind which will have 
<A NAME="265"></A>for its sequel the fact he wishes to recollect. For remembering (which 
<A NAME="266"></A>is the condicio sine qua non of recollecting) is the existence, potentially, 
<A NAME="267"></A>in the mind of a movement capable of stimulating it to the desired movement, 
<A NAME="268"></A>and this, as has been said, in such a way that the person should be moved 
<A NAME="269"></A>(prompted to recollection) from within himself, i.e. in consequence of 
<A NAME="270"></A>movements wholly contained within himself.
<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>But one must get hold of a starting-point. This explains why it 
<A NAME="272"></A>is that persons are supposed to recollect sometimes by starting from mnemonic 
<A NAME="273"></A>loci. The cause is that they pass swiftly in thought from one point to 
<A NAME="274"></A>another, e.g. from milk to white, from white to mist, and thence to moist, 
<A NAME="275"></A>from which one remembers Autumn (the 'season of mists'), if this be the 
<A NAME="276"></A>season he is trying to recollect.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>It seems true in general that the middle point also among all things 
<A NAME="278"></A>is a good mnemonic starting-point from which to reach any of them. For 
<A NAME="279"></A>if one does not recollect before, he will do so when he has come to this, 
<A NAME="280"></A>or, if not, nothing can help him; as, e.g. if one were to have in mind 
<A NAME="281"></A>the numerical series denoted by the symbols A, B, G, D, E, Z, I, H, O. 
<A NAME="282"></A>For, if he does not remember what he wants at E, then at E he remembers 
<A NAME="283"></A>O; because from E movement in either direction is possible, to D or to 
<A NAME="284"></A>Z. But, if it is not for one of these that he is searching, he will remember 
<A NAME="285"></A>(what he is searching for) when he has come to G if he is searching for 
<A NAME="286"></A>H or I. But if (it is) not (for H or I that he is searching, but for one 
<A NAME="287"></A>of the terms that remain), he will remember by going to A, and so in all 
<A NAME="288"></A>cases (in which one starts from a middle point). The cause of one's sometimes 
<A NAME="289"></A>recollecting and sometimes not, though starting from the same point, is, 
<A NAME="290"></A>that from the same starting-point a movement can be made in several directions, 
<A NAME="291"></A>as, for instance, from G to I or to D. If, then, the mind has not (when 
<A NAME="292"></A>starting from E) moved in an old path (i.e. one in which it moved first 
<A NAME="293"></A>having the objective experience, and that, therefore, in which un-'ethized' 
<A NAME="294"></A>phusis would have it again move), it tends to move to the more customary; 
<A NAME="295"></A>for (the mind having, by chance or otherwise, missed moving in the 'old' 
<A NAME="296"></A>way) Custom now assumes the role of Nature. Hence the rapidity with which 
<A NAME="297"></A>we recollect what we frequently think about. For as regular sequence of 
<A NAME="298"></A>events is in accordance with nature, so, too, regular sequence is observed 
<A NAME="299"></A>in the actualization of kinesis (in consciousness), and here frequency 
<A NAME="300"></A>tends to produce (the regularity of) nature. And since in the realm of 
<A NAME="301"></A>nature occurrences take place which are even contrary to nature, or fortuitous, 
<A NAME="302"></A>the same happens a fortiori in the sphere swayed by custom, since in this 
<A NAME="303"></A>sphere natural law is not similarly established. Hence it is that (from 
<A NAME="304"></A>the same starting-point) the mind receives an impulse to move sometimes 
<A NAME="305"></A>in the required direction, and at other times otherwise, (doing the latter) 
<A NAME="306"></A>particularly when something else somehow deflects the mind from the right 
<A NAME="307"></A>direction and attracts it to itself. This last consideration explains too 
<A NAME="308"></A>how it happens that, when we want to remember a name, we remember one somewhat 
<A NAME="309"></A>like it, indeed, but blunder in reference to (i.e. in pronouncing) the 
<A NAME="310"></A>one we intended.
<A NAME="311"></A><BR><BR>Thus, then, recollection takes place.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR>But the point of capital importance is that (for the purpose of recollection) 
<A NAME="313"></A>one should cognize, determinately or indeterminately, the time-relation 
<A NAME="314"></A>(of that which he wishes to recollect). There is,-let it be taken as a 
<A NAME="315"></A>fact,-something by which one distinguishes a greater and a smaller time; 
<A NAME="316"></A>and it is reasonable to think that one does this in a way analogous to 
<A NAME="317"></A>that in which one discerns (spacial) magnitudes. For it is not by the mind's 
<A NAME="318"></A>reaching out towards them, as some say a visual ray from the eye does (in 
<A NAME="319"></A>seeing), that one thinks of large things at a distance in space (for even 
<A NAME="320"></A>if they are not there, one may similarly think them); but one does so by 
<A NAME="321"></A>a proportionate mental movement. For there are in the mind the like figures 
<A NAME="322"></A>and movements (i.e. 'like' to those of objects and events). Therefore, 
<A NAME="323"></A>when one thinks the greater objects, in what will his thinking those differ 
<A NAME="324"></A>from his thinking the smaller? (In nothing,) because all the internal though 
<A NAME="325"></A>smaller are as it were proportional to the external. Now, as we may assume 
<A NAME="326"></A>within a person something proportional to the forms (of distant magnitudes), 
<A NAME="327"></A>so, too, we may doubtless assume also something else proportional to their 
<A NAME="328"></A>distances. As, therefore, if one has (psychically) the movement in AB, 
<A NAME="329"></A>Be, he constructs in thought (i.e. knows objectively) GD, since AG and 
<A NAME="330"></A>Gd bear equal ratios respectively (to AB and BE), (so he who recollects 
<A NAME="331"></A>also proceeds). Why then does he construct GD rather than Zh? Is it not 
<A NAME="332"></A>because as AG is to AB, so is O to I? These movements therefore (sc. in 
<A NAME="333"></A>AB, BE, and in O:I) he has simultaneously. But if he wishes to construct 
<A NAME="334"></A>to thought ZH, he has in mind BE in like manner as before (when constructing 
<A NAME="335"></A>GD), but now, instead of (the movements of the ratio) O:I, he has in mind 
<A NAME="336"></A>(those of the ratio K:L; for K:L::ZA:BA. (See diagram.)
<A NAME="337"></A><BR><BR>When, therefore, the 'movement' corresponding to the object and 
<A NAME="338"></A>that corresponding to its time concur, then one actually remembers. If 
<A NAME="339"></A>one supposes (himself to move in these different but concurrent ways) without 
<A NAME="340"></A>really doing so, he supposes himself to remember.
<A NAME="341"></A><BR><BR>For one may be mistaken, and think that he remembers when he really 
<A NAME="342"></A>does not. But it is not possible, conversely, that when one actually remembers 
<A NAME="343"></A>he should not suppose himself to remember, but should remember unconsciously. 
<A NAME="344"></A>For remembering, as we have conceived it, essentially implies consciousness 
<A NAME="345"></A>of itself. If, however, the movement corresponding to the objective fact 
<A NAME="346"></A>takes place without that corresponding to the time, or, if the latter takes 
<A NAME="347"></A>place without the former, one does not remember.
<A NAME="348"></A><BR><BR>The movement answering to the time is of two kinds. Sometimes in 
<A NAME="349"></A>remembering a fact one has no determinate time-notion of it, no such notion 
<A NAME="350"></A>as that e.g. he did something or other on the day before yesterday; while 
<A NAME="351"></A>in other cases he has a determinate notion-of the time. Still, even though 
<A NAME="352"></A>one does not remember with actual determination of the time, he genuinely 
<A NAME="353"></A>remembers, none the less. Persons are wont to say that they remember (something), 
<A NAME="354"></A>but yet do not know when (it occurred, as happens) whenever they do not 
<A NAME="355"></A>know determinately the exact length of time implied in the 
<A NAME="356"></A>'when'.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>It has been already stated that those who have a good memory are 
<A NAME="358"></A>not identical with those who are quick at recollecting. But the act of 
<A NAME="359"></A>recollecting differs from that of remembering, not only chronologically, 
<A NAME="360"></A>but also in this, that many also of the other animals (as well as man) 
<A NAME="361"></A>have memory, but, of all that we are acquainted with, none, we venture 
<A NAME="362"></A>to say, except man, shares in the faculty of recollection. The cause of 
<A NAME="363"></A>this is that recollection is, as it were a mode of inference. For he who 
<A NAME="364"></A>endeavours to recollect infers that he formerly saw, or heard, or had some 
<A NAME="365"></A>such experience, and the process (by which he succeeds in recollecting) 
<A NAME="366"></A>is, as it were, a sort of investigation. But to investigate in this way 
<A NAME="367"></A>belongs naturally to those animals alone which are also endowed with the 
<A NAME="368"></A>faculty of deliberation; (which proves what was said above), for deliberation 
<A NAME="369"></A>is a form of inference.
<A NAME="370"></A><BR><BR>That the affection is corporeal, i.e. that recollection is a searching 
<A NAME="371"></A>for an 'image' in a corporeal substrate, is proved by the fact that in 
<A NAME="372"></A>some persons, when, despite the most strenuous application of thought, 
<A NAME="373"></A>they have been unable to recollect, it (viz. the anamnesis = the effort 
<A NAME="374"></A>at recollection) excites a feeling of discomfort, which, even though they 
<A NAME="375"></A>abandon the effort at recollection, persists in them none the less; and 
<A NAME="376"></A>especially in persons of melancholic temperament. For these are most powerfully 
<A NAME="377"></A>moved by presentations. The reason why the effort of recollection is not 
<A NAME="378"></A>under the control of their will is that, as those who throw a stone cannot 
<A NAME="379"></A>stop it at their will when thrown, so he who tries to recollect and 'hunts' 
<A NAME="380"></A>(after an idea) sets up a process in a material part, (that) in which resides 
<A NAME="381"></A>the affection. Those who have moisture around that part which is the centre 
<A NAME="382"></A>of sense-perception suffer most discomfort of this kind. For when once 
<A NAME="383"></A>the moisture has been set in motion it is not easily brought to rest, until 
<A NAME="384"></A>the idea which was sought for has again presented itself, and thus the 
<A NAME="385"></A>movement has found a straight course. For a similar reason bursts of anger 
<A NAME="386"></A>or fits of terror, when once they have excited such motions, are not at 
<A NAME="387"></A>once allayed, even though the angry or terrified persons (by efforts of 
<A NAME="388"></A>will) set up counter motions, but the passions continue to move them on, 
<A NAME="389"></A>in the same direction as at first, in opposition to such counter motions. 
<A NAME="390"></A>The affection resembles also that in the case of words, tunes, or sayings, 
<A NAME="391"></A>whenever one of them has become inveterate on the lips. People give them 
<A NAME="392"></A>up and resolve to avoid them; yet again they find themselves humming the 
<A NAME="393"></A>forbidden air, or using the prohibited word. Those whose upper parts are 
<A NAME="394"></A>abnormally large, as. is the case with dwarfs, have abnormally weak memory, 
<A NAME="395"></A>as compared with their opposites, because of the great weight which they 
<A NAME="396"></A>have resting upon the organ of perception, and because their mnemonic movements 
<A NAME="397"></A>are, from the very first, not able to keep true to a course, but are dispersed, 
<A NAME="398"></A>and because, in the effort at recollection, these movements do not easily 
<A NAME="399"></A>find a direct onward path. Infants and very old persons have bad memories, 
<A NAME="400"></A>owing to the amount of movement going on within them; for the latter are 
<A NAME="401"></A>in process of rapid decay, the former in process of vigorous growth; and 
<A NAME="402"></A>we may add that children, until considerably advanced in years, are dwarf-like 
<A NAME="403"></A>in their bodily structure. Such then is our theory as regards memory and 
<A NAME="404"></A>remembering their nature, and the particular organ of the soul by which 
<A NAME="405"></A>animals remember; also as regards recollection, its formal definition, 
<A NAME="406"></A>and the manner and causes-of its performance.
