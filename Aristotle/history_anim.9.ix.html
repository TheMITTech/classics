<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Of the animals that are comparatively obscure and short-lived the characters 
<A NAME="12"></A>or dispositions are not so obvious to recognition as are those of animals 
<A NAME="13"></A>that are longer-lived. These latter animals appear to have a natural capacity 
<A NAME="14"></A>corresponding to each of the passions: to cunning or simplicity, courage 
<A NAME="15"></A>or timidity, to good temper or to bad, and to other similar dispositions 
<A NAME="16"></A>of mind.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>Some also are capable of giving or receiving instruction-of receiving 
<A NAME="18"></A>it from one another or from man: those that have the faculty of hearing, 
<A NAME="19"></A>for instance; and, not to limit the matter to audible sound, such as can 
<A NAME="20"></A>differentiate the suggested meanings of word and gesture.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>In all genera in which the distinction of male and female is found, 
<A NAME="22"></A>Nature makes a similar differentiation in the mental characteristics of 
<A NAME="23"></A>the two sexes. This differentiation is the most obvious in the case of 
<A NAME="24"></A>human kind and in that of the larger animals and the viviparous quadrupeds. 
<A NAME="25"></A>In the case of these latter the female softer in character, is the sooner 
<A NAME="26"></A>tamed, admits more readily of caressing, is more apt in the way of learning; 
<A NAME="27"></A>as, for instance, in the Laconian breed of dogs the female is cleverer 
<A NAME="28"></A>than the male. Of the Molossian breed of dogs, such as are employed in 
<A NAME="29"></A>the chase are pretty much the same as those elsewhere; but sheep-dogs of 
<A NAME="30"></A>this breed are superior to the others in size, and in the courage with 
<A NAME="31"></A>which they face the attacks of wild animals.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>Dogs that are born of a mixed breed between these two kinds are 
<A NAME="33"></A>remarkable for courage and endurance of hard labour.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>In all cases, excepting those of the bear and leopard, the female 
<A NAME="35"></A>is less spirited than the male; in regard to the two exceptional cases, 
<A NAME="36"></A>the superiority in courage rests with the female. With all other animals 
<A NAME="37"></A>the female is softer in disposition than the male, is more mischievous, 
<A NAME="38"></A>less simple, more impulsive, and more attentive to the nurture of the young: 
<A NAME="39"></A>the male, on the other hand, is more spirited than the female, more savage, 
<A NAME="40"></A>more simple and less cunning. The traces of these differentiated characteristics 
<A NAME="41"></A>are more or less visible everywhere, but they are especially visible where 
<A NAME="42"></A>character is the more developed, and most of all in 
<A NAME="43"></A>man.
<A NAME="44"></A><BR><BR>The fact is, the nature of man is the most rounded off and complete, 
<A NAME="45"></A>and consequently in man the qualities or capacities above referred to are 
<A NAME="46"></A>found in their perfection. Hence woman is more compassionate than man, 
<A NAME="47"></A>more easily moved to tears, at the same time is more jealous, more querulous, 
<A NAME="48"></A>more apt to scold and to strike. She is, furthermore, more prone to despondency 
<A NAME="49"></A>and less hopeful than the man, more void of shame or self-respect, more 
<A NAME="50"></A>false of speech, more deceptive, and of more retentive memory. She is also 
<A NAME="51"></A>more wakeful, more shrinking, more difficult to rouse to action, and requires 
<A NAME="52"></A>a smaller quantity of nutriment.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>As was previously stated, the male is more courageous than the 
<A NAME="54"></A>female, and more sympathetic in the way of standing by to help. Even in 
<A NAME="55"></A>the case of molluscs, when the cuttle-fish is struck with the trident the 
<A NAME="56"></A>male stands by to help the female; but when the male is struck the female 
<A NAME="57"></A>runs away.
<A NAME="58"></A><BR><BR>There is enmity between such animals as dwell in the same localities 
<A NAME="59"></A>or subsist on the food. If the means of subsistence run short, creatures 
<A NAME="60"></A>of like kind will fight together. Thus it is said that seals which inhabit 
<A NAME="61"></A>one and the same district will fight, male with male, and female with female, 
<A NAME="62"></A>until one combatant kills the other, or one is driven away by the other; 
<A NAME="63"></A>and their young do even in like manner.
<A NAME="64"></A><BR><BR>All creatures are at enmity with the carnivores, and the carnivores 
<A NAME="65"></A>with all the rest, for they all subsist on living creatures. Soothsayers 
<A NAME="66"></A>take notice of cases where animals keep apart from one another, and cases 
<A NAME="67"></A>where they congregate together; calling those that live at war with one 
<A NAME="68"></A>another 'dissociates', and those that dwell in peace with one another 'associates'. 
<A NAME="69"></A>One may go so far as to say that if there were no lack or stint of food, 
<A NAME="70"></A>then those animals that are now afraid of man or are wild by nature would 
<A NAME="71"></A>be tame and familiar with him, and in like manner with one another. This 
<A NAME="72"></A>is shown by the way animals are treated in Egypt, for owing to the fact 
<A NAME="73"></A>that food is constantly supplied to them the very fiercest creatures live 
<A NAME="74"></A>peaceably together. The fact is they are tamed by kindness, and in some 
<A NAME="75"></A>places crocodiles are tame to their priestly keeper from being fed by him. 
<A NAME="76"></A>And elsewhere also the same phenomenon is to be observed.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>The eagle and the snake are enemies, for the eagle lives on snakes; 
<A NAME="78"></A>so are the ichneumon and the venom-spider, for the ichneumon preys upon 
<A NAME="79"></A>the latter. In the case of birds, there is mutual enmity between the poecilis, 
<A NAME="80"></A>the crested lark, the woodpecker (?), and the chloreus, for they devour 
<A NAME="81"></A>one another's eggs; so also between the crow and the owl; for, owing to 
<A NAME="82"></A>the fact that the owl is dim-sighted by day, the crow at midday preys upon 
<A NAME="83"></A>the owl's eggs, and the owl at night upon the crow's, each having the whip-hand 
<A NAME="84"></A>of the other, turn and turn about, night and day.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>There is enmity also between the owl and the wren; for the latter 
<A NAME="86"></A>also devours the owl's eggs. In the daytime all other little birds flutter 
<A NAME="87"></A>round the owl-a practice which is popularly termed 'admiring him'-buffet 
<A NAME="88"></A>him, and pluck out his feathers; in consequence of this habit, bird-catchers 
<A NAME="89"></A>use the owl as a decoy for catching little birds of all 
<A NAME="90"></A>kinds.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>The so-called presbys or 'old man' is at war with the weasel and 
<A NAME="92"></A>the crow, for they prey on her eggs and her brood; and so the turtle-dove 
<A NAME="93"></A>with the pyrallis, for they live in the same districts and on the same 
<A NAME="94"></A>food; and so with the green wood pecker and the libyus; and so with kite 
<A NAME="95"></A>and the raven, for, owing to his having the advantage from stronger talons 
<A NAME="96"></A>and more rapid flight the former can steal whatever the latter is holding, 
<A NAME="97"></A>so that it is food also that makes enemies of these. In like manner there 
<A NAME="98"></A>is war between birds that get their living from the sea, as between the 
<A NAME="99"></A>brenthus, the gull, and the harpe; and so between the buzzard on one side 
<A NAME="100"></A>and the toad and snake on the other, for the buzzard preys upon the eggs 
<A NAME="101"></A>of the two others; and so between the turtle-dove and the chloreus; the 
<A NAME="102"></A>chloreus kills the dove, and the crow kills the so-called 
<A NAME="103"></A>drummer-bird.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>The aegolius, and birds of prey in general, prey upon the calaris, 
<A NAME="105"></A>and consequently there is war between it and them; and so is there war 
<A NAME="106"></A>between the gecko-lizard and the spider, for the former preys upon the 
<A NAME="107"></A>latter; and so between the woodpecker and the heron, for the former preys 
<A NAME="108"></A>upon the eggs and brood of the latter. And so between the aegithus and 
<A NAME="109"></A>the ass, owing to the fact that the ass, in passing a furze-bush, rubs 
<A NAME="110"></A>its sore and itching parts against the prickles; by so doing, and all the 
<A NAME="111"></A>more if it brays, it topples the eggs and the brood out of the nest, the 
<A NAME="112"></A>young ones tumble out in fright, and the mother-bird, to avenge this wrong, 
<A NAME="113"></A>flies at the beast and pecks at his sore places.
<A NAME="114"></A><BR><BR>The wolf is at war with the ass, the bull, and the fox, for as 
<A NAME="115"></A>being a carnivore, he attacks these other animals; and so for the same 
<A NAME="116"></A>reason with the fox and the circus, for the circus, being carnivorous and 
<A NAME="117"></A>furnished with crooked talons, attacks and maims the animal. And so the 
<A NAME="118"></A>raven is at war with the bull and the ass, for it flies at them, and strikes 
<A NAME="119"></A>them, and pecks at their eyes; and so with the eagle and the heron, for 
<A NAME="120"></A>the former, having crooked talons, attacks the latter, and the latter usually 
<A NAME="121"></A>succumbs to the attack; and so the merlin with the vulture; and the crex 
<A NAME="122"></A>with the eleus-owl, the blackbird, and the oriole (of this latter bird, 
<A NAME="123"></A>by the way, the story goes that he was originally born out of a funeral 
<A NAME="124"></A>pyre): the cause of warfare is that the crex injures both them and their 
<A NAME="125"></A>young. The nuthatch and the wren are at war with the eagle; the nuthatch 
<A NAME="126"></A>breaks the eagle's eggs, so the eagle is at war with it on special grounds, 
<A NAME="127"></A>though, as a bird of prey, it carries on a general war all round. The horse 
<A NAME="128"></A>and the anthus are enemies, and the horse will drive the bird out of the 
<A NAME="129"></A>field where he is grazing: the bird feeds on grass, and sees too dimly 
<A NAME="130"></A>to foresee an attack; it mimics the whinnying of the horse, flies at him, 
<A NAME="131"></A>and tries to frighten him away; but the horse drives the bird away, and 
<A NAME="132"></A>whenever he catches it he kills it: this bird lives beside rivers or on 
<A NAME="133"></A>marsh ground; it has pretty plumage, and finds its without trouble. The 
<A NAME="134"></A>ass is at enmity with the lizard, for the lizard sleeps in his manger, 
<A NAME="135"></A>gets into his nostril, and prevents his eating.
<A NAME="136"></A><BR><BR>Of herons there are three kinds: the ash coloured, the white, and 
<A NAME="137"></A>the starry heron (or bittern). Of these the first mentioned submits with 
<A NAME="138"></A>reluctance to the duties of incubation, or to union of the sexes; in fact, 
<A NAME="139"></A>it screams during the union, and it is said drips blood from its eyes; 
<A NAME="140"></A>it lays its eggs also in an awkward manner, not unattended with pain. It 
<A NAME="141"></A>is at war with certain creatures that do it injury: with the eagle for 
<A NAME="142"></A>robbing it, with the fox for worrying it at night, and with the lark for 
<A NAME="143"></A>stealing its eggs.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>The snake is at war with the weasel and the pig; with the weasel 
<A NAME="145"></A>when they are both at home, for they live on the same food; with the pig 
<A NAME="146"></A>for preying on her kind. The merlin is at war with the fox; it strikes 
<A NAME="147"></A>and claws it, and, as it has crooked talons, it kills the animal's young. 
<A NAME="148"></A>The raven and the fox are good friends, for the raven is at enmity with 
<A NAME="149"></A>the merlin; and so when the merlin assails the fox the raven comes and 
<A NAME="150"></A>helps the animal. The vulture and the merlin are mutual enemies, as being 
<A NAME="151"></A>both furnished with crooked talons. The vulture fights with the eagle, 
<A NAME="152"></A>and so, by the way, does does swan; and the swan is often victorious: moreover, 
<A NAME="153"></A>of all birds swans are most prone to the killing of one 
<A NAME="154"></A>another.
<A NAME="155"></A><BR><BR>In regard to wild creatures, some sets are at enmity with other 
<A NAME="156"></A>sets at all times and under all circumstances; others, as in the case of 
<A NAME="157"></A>man and man, at special times and under incidental circumstances. The ass 
<A NAME="158"></A>and the acanthis are enemies; for the bird lives on thistles, and the ass 
<A NAME="159"></A>browses on thistles when they are young and tender. The anthus, the acanthis, 
<A NAME="160"></A>and the aegithus are at enmity with one another; it is said that the blood 
<A NAME="161"></A>of the anthus will not intercommingle with the blood of the aegithus. The 
<A NAME="162"></A>crow and the heron are friends, as also are the sedge-bird and lark, the 
<A NAME="163"></A>laedus and the celeus or green woodpecker; the woodpecker lives on the 
<A NAME="164"></A>banks of rivers and beside brakes, the laedus lives on rocks and bills, 
<A NAME="165"></A>and is greatly attached to its nesting-place. The piphinx, the harpe, and 
<A NAME="166"></A>the kite are friends; as are the fox and the snake, for both burrow underground; 
<A NAME="167"></A>so also are the blackbird and the turtle-dove. The lion and the thos or 
<A NAME="168"></A>civet are enemies, for both are carnivorous and live on the same food. 
<A NAME="169"></A>Elephants fight fiercely with one another, and stab one another with their 
<A NAME="170"></A>tusks; of two combatants the beaten one gets completely cowed, and dreads 
<A NAME="171"></A>the sound of his conqueror's voice. These animals differ from one another 
<A NAME="172"></A>an extraordinary extent in the way of courage. Indians employ these animals 
<A NAME="173"></A>for war purposes, irrespective of sex; the females, however, are less in 
<A NAME="174"></A>size and much inferior in point of spirit. An elephant by pushing with 
<A NAME="175"></A>his big tusks can batter down a wall, and will butt with his forehead at 
<A NAME="176"></A>a palm until he brings it down, when he stamps on it and lays it in orderly 
<A NAME="177"></A>fashion on the ground. Men hunt the elephant in the following way: they 
<A NAME="178"></A>mount tame elephants of approved spirit and proceed in quest of wild animals; 
<A NAME="179"></A>when they come up with these they bid the tame brutes to beat the wild 
<A NAME="180"></A>ones until they tire the latter completely. Hereupon the driver mounts 
<A NAME="181"></A>a wild brute and guides him with the application of his metal prong; after 
<A NAME="182"></A>this the creature soon becomes tame, and obeys guidance. Now when the driver 
<A NAME="183"></A>is on their back they are all tractable, but after he has dismounted, some 
<A NAME="184"></A>are tame and others vicious; in the case of these latter, they tie their 
<A NAME="185"></A>front-legs with ropes to keep them quiet. The animal is hunted whether 
<A NAME="186"></A>young or full grown.
<A NAME="187"></A><BR><BR>Thus we see that in the case of the creatures above mentioned their 
<A NAME="188"></A>mutual friendship or the is due to the food they feed on and the life they 
<A NAME="189"></A>lead.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="190"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="191"></A><BR><BR>Of fishes, such as swim in shoals together are friendly to one 
<A NAME="192"></A>another; such as do not so swim are enemies. Some fishes swarm during the 
<A NAME="193"></A>spawning season; others after they have spawned. To state the matter comprehensively, 
<A NAME="194"></A>we may say that the following are shoaling fish: the tunny, the maenis, 
<A NAME="195"></A>the sea-gudgeon, the bogue, the horse-mackerel, the coracine, the synodon 
<A NAME="196"></A>or dentex, the red mullet, the sphyraena, the anthias, the eleginus, the 
<A NAME="197"></A>atherine, the sarginus, the gar-fish, (the squid,) the rainbow-wrasse, 
<A NAME="198"></A>the pelamyd, the mackerel, the coly-mackerel. Of these some not only swim 
<A NAME="199"></A>in shoals, but go in pairs inside the shoal; the rest without exception 
<A NAME="200"></A>swim in pairs, and only swim in shoals at certain periods: that is, as 
<A NAME="201"></A>has been said, when they are heavy with spawn or after they have 
<A NAME="202"></A>spawned.
<A NAME="203"></A><BR><BR>The basse and the grey mullet are bitter enemies, but they swarm 
<A NAME="204"></A>together at certain times; for at times not only do fishes of the same 
<A NAME="205"></A>species swarm together, but also those whose feeding-grounds are identical 
<A NAME="206"></A>or adjacent, if the food-supply be abundant. The grey mullet is often found 
<A NAME="207"></A>alive with its tail lopped off, and the conger with all that part of its 
<A NAME="208"></A>body removed that lies to the rear of the vent; in the case of the mullet 
<A NAME="209"></A>the injury is wrought by the basse, in that of the conger-eel by the muraena. 
<A NAME="210"></A>There is war between the larger and the lesser fishes: for the big fishes 
<A NAME="211"></A>prey on the little ones. So much on the subject of marine 
<A NAME="212"></A>animals.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="213"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="214"></A><BR><BR>The characters of animals, as has been observed, differ in respect 
<A NAME="215"></A>to timidity, to gentleness, to courage, to tameness, to intelligence, and 
<A NAME="216"></A>to stupidity.
<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>The sheep is said to be naturally dull and stupid. Of all quadrupeds 
<A NAME="218"></A>it is the most foolish: it will saunter away to lonely places with no object 
<A NAME="219"></A>in view; oftentimes in stormy weather it will stray from shelter; if it 
<A NAME="220"></A>be overtaken by a snowstorm, it will stand still unless the shepherd sets 
<A NAME="221"></A>it in motion; it will stay behind and perish unless the shepherd brings 
<A NAME="222"></A>up the rams; it will then follow home.
<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>If you catch hold of a goat's beard at the extremity-the beard 
<A NAME="224"></A>is of a substance resembling hair-all the companion goats will stand stock 
<A NAME="225"></A>still, staring at this particular goat in a kind of 
<A NAME="226"></A>dumbfounderment.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>You will have a warmer bed in amongst the goats than among the 
<A NAME="228"></A>sheep, because the goats will be quieter and will creep up towards you; 
<A NAME="229"></A>for the goat is more impatient of cold than the sheep.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>Shepherds train sheep to close in together at a clap of their hands, 
<A NAME="231"></A>for if, when a thunderstorm comes on, a ewe stays behind without closing 
<A NAME="232"></A>in, the storm will kill it if it be with young; consequently if a sudden 
<A NAME="233"></A>clap or noise is made, they close in together within the sheepfold by reason 
<A NAME="234"></A>of their training.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>Even bulls, when they are roaming by themselves apart from the 
<A NAME="236"></A>herd, are killed by wild animals.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>Sheep and goats lie crowded together, kin by kin. When the sun 
<A NAME="238"></A>turns early towards its setting, the goats are said to lie no longer face 
<A NAME="239"></A>to face, but back to back.

<A NAME="241"></A><BR><BR>Cattle at pasture keep together in their accustomed herds, and 
<A NAME="242"></A>if one animal strays away the rest will follow; consequently if the herdsmen 
<A NAME="243"></A>lose one particular animal, they keep close watch on all the 
<A NAME="244"></A>rest.
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>When mares with their colts pasture together in the same field, 
<A NAME="246"></A>if one dam dies the others will take up the rearing of the colt. In point 
<A NAME="247"></A>of fact, the mare appears to be singularly prone by nature to maternal 
<A NAME="248"></A>fondness; in proof whereof a barren mare will steal the foal from its dam, 
<A NAME="249"></A>will tend it with all the solicitude of a mother, but, as it will be unprovided 
<A NAME="250"></A>with mother's milk, its solicitude will prove fatal to its 
<A NAME="251"></A>charge.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="252"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>Among wild quadrupeds the hind appears to be pre-eminently intelligent; 
<A NAME="254"></A>for example, in its habit of bringing forth its young on the sides of public 
<A NAME="255"></A>roads, where the fear of man forbids the approach of wild animals. Again, 
<A NAME="256"></A>after parturition, it first swallows the afterbirth, then goes in quest 
<A NAME="257"></A>of the seseli shrub, and after eating of it returns to its young. The mother 
<A NAME="258"></A>takes its young betimes to her lair, so leading it to know its place of 
<A NAME="259"></A>refuge in time of danger; this lair is a precipitous rock, with only one 
<A NAME="260"></A>approach, and there it is said to hold its own against all comers. The 
<A NAME="261"></A>male when it gets fat, which it does in a high degree in autumn, disappears, 
<A NAME="262"></A>abandoning its usual resorts, apparently under an idea that its fatness 
<A NAME="263"></A>facilitates its capture. They shed their horns in places difficult of access 
<A NAME="264"></A>or discovery, whence the proverbial expression of 'the place where the 
<A NAME="265"></A>stag sheds his horns'; the fact being that, as having parted with their 
<A NAME="266"></A>weapons, they take care not to be seen. The saying is that no man has ever 
<A NAME="267"></A>seen the animal's left horn; that the creature keeps it out of sight because 
<A NAME="268"></A>it possesses some medicinal property.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>In their first year stags grow no horns, but only an excrescence 
<A NAME="270"></A>indicating where horns will be, this excrescence being short and thick. 
<A NAME="271"></A>In their second year they grow their horns for the first time, straight 
<A NAME="272"></A>in shape, like pegs for hanging clothes on; and on this account they have 
<A NAME="273"></A>an appropriate nickname. In the third year the antlers are bifurcate; in 
<A NAME="274"></A>the fourth year they grow trifurcate; and so they go on increasing in complexity 
<A NAME="275"></A>until the creature is six years old: after this they grow their horns without 
<A NAME="276"></A>any specific differentiation, so that you cannot by observation of them 
<A NAME="277"></A>tell the animal's age. But the patriarchs of the herd may be told chiefly 
<A NAME="278"></A>by two signs; in the first place they have few teeth or none at all, and, 
<A NAME="279"></A>in the second place, they have ceased to grow the pointed tips to their 
<A NAME="280"></A>antlers. The forward-pointing tips of the growing horns (that is to say 
<A NAME="281"></A>the brow antlers), with which the animal meets attack, are technically 
<A NAME="282"></A>termed its 'defenders'; with these the patriarchs are unprovided, and their 
<A NAME="283"></A>antlers merely grow straight upwards. Stags shed their horns annually, 
<A NAME="284"></A>in or about the month of May; after shedding, they conceal themselves, 
<A NAME="285"></A>it is said, during the daytime, and, to avoid the flies, hide in thick 
<A NAME="286"></A>copses; during this time, until they have grown their horns, they feed 
<A NAME="287"></A>at night-time. The horns at first grow in a kind of skin envelope, and 
<A NAME="288"></A>get rough by degrees; when they reach their full size the animal basks 
<A NAME="289"></A>in the sun, to mature and dry them. When they need no longer rub them against 
<A NAME="290"></A>tree-trunks they quit their hiding places, from a sense of security based 
<A NAME="291"></A>upon the possession of arms defensive and offensive. An Achaeine stag has 
<A NAME="292"></A>been caught with a quantity of green ivy grown over its horns, it having 
<A NAME="293"></A>grown apparently, as on fresh green wood, when the horns were young and 
<A NAME="294"></A>tender. When a stag is stung by a venom-spider or similar insect, it gathers 
<A NAME="295"></A>crabs and eats them; it is said to be a good thing for man to drink the 
<A NAME="296"></A>juice, but the taste is disagreeable. The hinds after parturition at once 
<A NAME="297"></A>swallow the afterbirth, and it is impossible to secure it, for the hind 
<A NAME="298"></A>catches it before it falls to the ground: now this substance is supposed 
<A NAME="299"></A>to have medicinal properties. When hunted the creatures are caught by singing 
<A NAME="300"></A>or pipe-playing on the part of the hunters; they are so pleased with the 
<A NAME="301"></A>music that they lie down on the grass. If there be two hunters, one before 
<A NAME="302"></A>their eyes sings or plays the pipe, the other keeps out of sight and shoots, 
<A NAME="303"></A>at a signal given by the confederate. If the animal has its ears cocked, 
<A NAME="304"></A>it can hear well and you cannot escape its ken; if its ears are down, you 
<A NAME="305"></A>can.

<A NAME="306"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="307"></A><BR><BR>When bears are running away from their pursuers they push their 
<A NAME="308"></A>cubs in front of them, or take them up and carry them; when they are being 
<A NAME="309"></A>overtaken they climb up a tree. When emerging from their winter-den, they 
<A NAME="310"></A>at once take to eating cuckoo-pint, as has been said, and chew sticks of 
<A NAME="311"></A>wood as though they were cutting teeth.
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>Many other quadrupeds help themselves in clever ways. Wild goats 
<A NAME="313"></A>in Crete are said, when wounded by arrows, to go in search of dittany, 
<A NAME="314"></A>which is supposed to have the property of ejecting arrows in the body. 
<A NAME="315"></A>Dogs, when they are ill, eat some kind of grass and produce vomiting. The 
<A NAME="316"></A>panther, after eating panther's-bane, tries to find some human excrement, 
<A NAME="317"></A>which is said to heal its pain. This panther's-bane kills lions as well. 
<A NAME="318"></A>Hunters hang up human excrement in a vessel attached to the boughs of a 
<A NAME="319"></A>tree, to keep the animal from straying to any distance; the animal meets 
<A NAME="320"></A>its end in leaping up to the branch and trying to get at the medicine. 
<A NAME="321"></A>They say that the panther has found out that wild animals are fond of the 
<A NAME="322"></A>scent it emits; that, when it goes a-hunting, it hides itself; that the 
<A NAME="323"></A>other animals come nearer and nearer, and that by this stratagem it can 
<A NAME="324"></A>catch even animals as swift of foot as stags.
<A NAME="325"></A><BR><BR>The Egyptian ichneumon, when it sees the serpent called the asp, 
<A NAME="326"></A>does not attack it until it has called in other ichneumons to help; to 
<A NAME="327"></A>meet the blows and bites of their enemy the assailants beplaster themselves 
<A NAME="328"></A>with mud, by first soaking in the river and then rolling on the 
<A NAME="329"></A>ground.
<A NAME="330"></A><BR><BR>When the crocodile yawns, the trochilus flies into his mouth and 
<A NAME="331"></A>cleans his teeth. The trochilus gets his food thereby, and the crocodile 
<A NAME="332"></A>gets ease and comfort; it makes no attempt to injure its little friend, 
<A NAME="333"></A>but, when it wants it to go, it shakes its neck in warning, lest it should 
<A NAME="334"></A>accidentally bite the bird.
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>The tortoise, when it has partaken of a snake, eats marjoram; this 
<A NAME="336"></A>action has been actually observed. A man saw a tortoise perform this operation 
<A NAME="337"></A>over and over again, and every time it plucked up some marjoram go back 
<A NAME="338"></A>to partake of its prey; he thereupon pulled the marjoram up by the roots, 
<A NAME="339"></A>and the consequence was the tortoise died. The weasel, when it fights with 
<A NAME="340"></A>a snake, first eats wild rue, the smell of which is noxious to the snake. 
<A NAME="341"></A>The dragon, when it eats fruit, swallows endive-juice; it has been seen 
<A NAME="342"></A>in the act. Dogs, when they suffer from worms, eat the standing corn. Storks, 
<A NAME="343"></A>and all other birds, when they get a wound fighting, apply marjoram to 
<A NAME="344"></A>the place injured.
<A NAME="345"></A><BR><BR>Many have seen the locust, when fighting with the snake get a tight 
<A NAME="346"></A>hold of the snake by the neck. The weasel has a clever way of getting the 
<A NAME="347"></A>better of birds; it tears their throats open, as wolves do with sheep. 
<A NAME="348"></A>Weasels fight desperately with mice-catching snakes, as they both prey 
<A NAME="349"></A>on the same animal.
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>In regard to the instinct of hedgehogs, it has been observed in 
<A NAME="351"></A>many places that, when the wind is shifting from north to south, and from 
<A NAME="352"></A>south to north, they shift the outlook of their earth-holes, and those 
<A NAME="353"></A>that are kept in domestication shift over from one wall to the other. The 
<A NAME="354"></A>story goes that a man in Byzantium got into high repute for foretelling 
<A NAME="355"></A>a change of weather, all owing to his having noticed this habit of the 
<A NAME="356"></A>hedgehog.
<A NAME="357"></A><BR><BR>The polecat or marten is about as large as the smaller breed of 
<A NAME="358"></A>Maltese dogs. In the thickness of its fur, in its look, in the white of 
<A NAME="359"></A>its belly, and in its love of mischief, it resembles the weasel; it is 
<A NAME="360"></A>easily tamed; from its liking for honey it is a plague to bee-hives; it 
<A NAME="361"></A>preys on birds like the cat. Its genital organ, as has been said, consists 
<A NAME="362"></A>of bone: the organ of the male is supposed to be a cure for strangury; 
<A NAME="363"></A>doctors scrape it into powder, and administer it in that 
<A NAME="364"></A>form.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="365"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>In a general way in the lives of animals many resemblances to human 
<A NAME="367"></A>life may be observed. Pre-eminent intelligence will be seen more in small 
<A NAME="368"></A>creatures than in large ones, as is exemplified in the case of birds by 
<A NAME="369"></A>the nest building of the swallow. In the same way as men do, the bird mixes 
<A NAME="370"></A>mud and chaff together; if it runs short of mud, it souses its body in 
<A NAME="371"></A>water and rolls about in the dry dust with wet feathers; furthermore, just 
<A NAME="372"></A>as man does, it makes a bed of straw, putting hard material below for a 
<A NAME="373"></A>foundation, and adapting all to suit its own size. Both parents co-operate 
<A NAME="374"></A>in the rearing of the young; each of the parents will detect, with practised 
<A NAME="375"></A>eye, the young one that has had a helping, and will take care it is not 
<A NAME="376"></A>helped twice over; at first the parents will rid the nest of excrement, 
<A NAME="377"></A>but, when the young are grown, they will teach their young to shift their 
<A NAME="378"></A>position and let their excrement fall over the side of the 
<A NAME="379"></A>nest.
<A NAME="380"></A><BR><BR>Pigeons exhibit other phenomena with a similar likeness to the 
<A NAME="381"></A>ways of humankind. In pairing the same male and the same female keep together; 
<A NAME="382"></A>and the union is only broken by the death of one of the two parties. At 
<A NAME="383"></A>the time of parturition in the female the sympathetic attentions of the 
<A NAME="384"></A>male are extraordinary; if the female is afraid on account of the impending 
<A NAME="385"></A>parturition to enter the nest, the male will beat her and force her to 
<A NAME="386"></A>come in. When the young are born, he will take and masticate pieces of 
<A NAME="387"></A>suitable food, will open the beaks of the fledglings, and inject these 
<A NAME="388"></A>pieces, thus preparing them betimes to take food. (When the male bird is 
<A NAME="389"></A>about to expel the the young ones from the nest he cohabits with them all.) 
<A NAME="390"></A>As a general rule these birds show this conjugal fidelity, but occasionally 
<A NAME="391"></A>a female will cohabit with other than her mate. These birds are combative, 
<A NAME="392"></A>and quarrel with one another, and enter each other's nests, though this 
<A NAME="393"></A>occurs but seldom; at a distance from their nests this quarrelsomeness 
<A NAME="394"></A>is less marked, but in the close neighbourhood of their nests they will 
<A NAME="395"></A>fight desperately. A peculiarity common to the tame pigeon, the ring-dove 
<A NAME="396"></A>and the turtle-dove is that they do not lean the head back when they are 
<A NAME="397"></A>in the act of drinking, but only when they have fully quenched their thirst. 
<A NAME="398"></A>The turtle-dove and the ring-dove both have but one mate, and let no other 
<A NAME="399"></A>come nigh; both sexes co-operate in the process of incubation. It is difficult 
<A NAME="400"></A>to distinguish between the sexes except by an examination of their interiors. 
<A NAME="401"></A>Ring-doves are long-lived; cases have been known where such birds were 
<A NAME="402"></A>twenty-five years old, thirty years old, and in some cases forty. As they 
<A NAME="403"></A>grow old their claws increase in size, and pigeon-fanciers cut the claws; 
<A NAME="404"></A>as far as one can see, the birds suffer no other perceptible disfigurement 
<A NAME="405"></A>by their increase in age. Turtle-doves and pigeons that are blinded by 
<A NAME="406"></A>fanciers for use as decoys, live for eight years. Partridges live for about 
<A NAME="407"></A>fifteen years. Ring-doves and turtle-doves always build their nests in 
<A NAME="408"></A>the same place year after year. The male, as a general rule, is more long-lived 
<A NAME="409"></A>than the female; but in the case of pigeons some assert that the male dies 
<A NAME="410"></A>before the female, taking their inference from the statements of persons 
<A NAME="411"></A>who keep decoy-birds in captivity. Some declare that the male sparrow lives 
<A NAME="412"></A>only a year, pointing to the fact that early in spring the male sparrow 
<A NAME="413"></A>has no black beard, but has one later on, as though the blackbearded birds 
<A NAME="414"></A>of the last year had all died out; they also say that the females are the 
<A NAME="415"></A>longer lived, on the grounds that they are caught in amongst the young 
<A NAME="416"></A>birds and that their age is rendered manifest by the hardness about their 
<A NAME="417"></A>beaks. Turtle-doves in summer live in cold places, (and in warm places 
<A NAME="418"></A>during the winter); chaffinches affect warm habitations in summer and cold 
<A NAME="419"></A>ones in winter.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="420"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>Birds of a heavy build, such as quails, partridges, and the like, 
<A NAME="422"></A>build no nests; indeed, where they are incapable of flight, it would be 
<A NAME="423"></A>of no use if they could do so. After scraping a hole on a level piece of 
<A NAME="424"></A>ground-and it is only in such a place that they lay their eggs-they cover 
<A NAME="425"></A>it over with thorns and sticks for security against hawks and eagles, and 
<A NAME="426"></A>there lay their eggs and hatch them; after the hatching is over, they at 
<A NAME="427"></A>once lead the young out from the nest, as they are not able to fly afield 
<A NAME="428"></A>for food for them. Quails and partridges, like barn-door hens, when they 
<A NAME="429"></A>go to rest, gather their brood under their wings. Not to be discovered, 
<A NAME="430"></A>as might be the case if they stayed long in one spot, they do not hatch 
<A NAME="431"></A>the eggs where they laid them. When a man comes by chance upon a young 
<A NAME="432"></A>brood, and tries to catch them, the hen-bird rolls in front of the hunter, 
<A NAME="433"></A>pretending to be lame: the man every moment thinks he is on the point of 
<A NAME="434"></A>catching her, and so she draws him on and on, until every one of her brood 
<A NAME="435"></A>has had time to escape; hereupon she returns to the nest and calls the 
<A NAME="436"></A>young back. The partridge lays not less than ten eggs, and often lays as 
<A NAME="437"></A>many as sixteen. As has been observed, the bird has mischievous and deceitful 
<A NAME="438"></A>habits. In the spring-time, a noisy scrimmage takes place, out of which 
<A NAME="439"></A>the male-birds emerge each with a hen. Owing to the lecherous nature of 
<A NAME="440"></A>the bird, and from a dislike to the hen sitting, the males, if they find 
<A NAME="441"></A>any eggs, roll them over and over until they break them in pieces; to provide 
<A NAME="442"></A>against this the female goes to a distance and lays the eggs, and often, 
<A NAME="443"></A>under the stress of parturition, lays them in any chance spot that offers; 
<A NAME="444"></A>if the male be near at hand, then to keep the eggs intact she refrains 
<A NAME="445"></A>from visiting them. If she be seen by a man, then, just as with her fledged 
<A NAME="446"></A>brood, she entices him off by showing herself close at his feet until she 
<A NAME="447"></A>has drawn him to a distance. When the females have run away and taken to 
<A NAME="448"></A>sitting, the males in a pack take to screaming and fighting; when thus 
<A NAME="449"></A>engaged, they have the nickname of 'widowers'. The bird who is beaten follows 
<A NAME="450"></A>his victor, and submits to be covered by him only; and the beaten bird 
<A NAME="451"></A>is covered by a second one or by any other, only clandestinely without 
<A NAME="452"></A>the victor's knowledge; this is so, not at all times, but at a particular 
<A NAME="453"></A>season of the year, and with quails as well as with partridges. A similar 
<A NAME="454"></A>proceeding takes place occasionally with barn-door cocks: for in temples, 
<A NAME="455"></A>where cocks are set apart as dedicate without hens, they all as a matter 
<A NAME="456"></A>of course tread any new-comer. Tame partridges tread wild birds, pecket 
<A NAME="457"></A>their heads, and treat them with every possible outrage. The leader of 
<A NAME="458"></A>the wild birds, with a counter-note of challenge, pushes forward to attack 
<A NAME="459"></A>the decoy-bird, and after he has been netted, another advances with a similar 
<A NAME="460"></A>note. This is what is done if the decoy be a male; but if it be a female 
<A NAME="461"></A>that is the decoy and gives the note, and the leader of the wild birds 
<A NAME="462"></A>give a counter one, the rest of the males set upon him and chase him away 
<A NAME="463"></A>from the female for making advances to her instead of to them; in consequence 
<A NAME="464"></A>of this the male often advances without uttering any cry, so that no other 
<A NAME="465"></A>may hear him and come and give him battle; and experienced fowlers assert 
<A NAME="466"></A>that sometimes the male bird, when he approaches the female, makes her 
<A NAME="467"></A>keep silence, to avoid having to give battle to other males who might have 
<A NAME="468"></A>heard him. The partridge has not only the note here referred to, but also 
<A NAME="469"></A>a thin shrill cry and other notes. Oftentimes the hen-bird rises from off 
<A NAME="470"></A>her brood when she sees the male showing attentions to the female decoy; 
<A NAME="471"></A>she will give the counter note and remain still, so as to be trodden by 
<A NAME="472"></A>him and divert him from the decoy. The quail and the partridge are so intent 
<A NAME="473"></A>upon sexual union that they often come right in the way of the decoy-birds, 
<A NAME="474"></A>and not seldom alight upon their heads. So much for the sexual proclivities 
<A NAME="475"></A>of the partridge, for the way in which it is hunted, and the general nasty 
<A NAME="476"></A>habits of the bird.
<A NAME="477"></A><BR><BR>As has been said, quails and partridges build their nests upon 
<A NAME="478"></A>the ground, and so also do some of the birds that are capable of sustained 
<A NAME="479"></A>flight. Further, for instance, of such birds, the lark and the woodcock, 
<A NAME="480"></A>as well as the quail, do not perch on a branch, but squat upon the 
<A NAME="481"></A>ground.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="482"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="483"></A><BR><BR>The woodpecker does not squat on the ground, but pecks at the bark 
<A NAME="484"></A>of trees to drive out from under it maggots and gnats; when they emerge, 
<A NAME="485"></A>it licks them up with its tongue, which is large and flat. It can run up 
<A NAME="486"></A>and down a tree in any way, even with the head downwards, like the gecko-lizard. 
<A NAME="487"></A>For secure hold upon a tree, its claws are better adapted than those of 
<A NAME="488"></A>the daw; it makes its way by sticking these claws into the bark. One species 
<A NAME="489"></A>of woodpecker is smaller than a blackbird, and has small reddish speckles; 
<A NAME="490"></A>a second species is larger than the blackbird, and a third is not much 
<A NAME="491"></A>smaller than a barn-door hen. It builds a nest on trees, as has been said, 
<A NAME="492"></A>on olive trees amongst others. It feeds on the maggots and ants that are 
<A NAME="493"></A>under the bark: it is so eager in the search for maggots that it is said 
<A NAME="494"></A>sometimes to hollow a tree out to its downfall. A woodpecker once, in course 
<A NAME="495"></A>of domestication, was seen to insert an almond into a hole in a piece of 
<A NAME="496"></A>timber, so that it might remain steady under its pecking; at the third 
<A NAME="497"></A>peck it split the shell of the fruit, and then ate the 
<A NAME="498"></A>kernel.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="499"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>Many indications of high intelligence are given by cranes. They 
<A NAME="501"></A>will fly to a great distance and up in the air, to command an extensive 
<A NAME="502"></A>view; if they see clouds and signs of bad weather they fly down again and 
<A NAME="503"></A>remain still. They, furthermore, have a leader in their flight, and patrols 
<A NAME="504"></A>that scream on the confines of the flock so as to be heard by all. When 
<A NAME="505"></A>they settle down, the main body go to sleep with their heads under their 
<A NAME="506"></A>wing, standing first on one leg and then on the other, while their leader, 
<A NAME="507"></A>with his head uncovered, keeps a sharp look out, and when he sees anything 
<A NAME="508"></A>of importance signals it with a cry.
<A NAME="509"></A><BR><BR>Pelicans that live beside rivers swallow the large smooth mussel-shells: 
<A NAME="510"></A>after cooking them inside the crop that precedes the stomach, they spit 
<A NAME="511"></A>them out, so that, now when their shells are open, they may pick the flesh 
<A NAME="512"></A>out and eat it.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="513"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="514"></A><BR><BR>Of wild birds, the nests are fashioned to meet the exigencies of 
<A NAME="515"></A>existence and ensure the security of the young. Some of these birds are 
<A NAME="516"></A>fond of their young and take great care of them, others are quite the reverse; 
<A NAME="517"></A>some are clever in procuring subsistence, others are not so. Some of these 
<A NAME="518"></A>birds build in ravines and clefts, and on cliffs, as, for instance, the 
<A NAME="519"></A>so-called charadrius, or stone-curlew; this bird is in no way noteworthy 
<A NAME="520"></A>for plumage or voice; it makes an appearance at night, but in the daytime 
<A NAME="521"></A>keeps out of sight.
<A NAME="522"></A><BR><BR>The hawk also builds in inaccessible places. Although a ravenous 
<A NAME="523"></A>bird, it will never eat the heart of any bird it catches; this has been 
<A NAME="524"></A>observed in the case of the quail, the thrush, and other birds. They modify 
<A NAME="525"></A>betimes their method of hunting, for in summer they do not grab their prey 
<A NAME="526"></A>as they do at other seasons.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>Of the vulture, it is said that no one has ever seen either its 
<A NAME="528"></A>young or its nest; on this account and on the ground that all of a sudden 
<A NAME="529"></A>great numbers of them will appear without any one being able to tell from 
<A NAME="530"></A>whence they come, Herodorus, the father of Bryson the sophist, says that 
<A NAME="531"></A>it belongs to some distant and elevated land. The reason is that the bird 
<A NAME="532"></A>has its nest on inaccessible crags, and is found only in a few localities. 
<A NAME="533"></A>The female lays one egg as a rule, and two at the most.
<A NAME="534"></A><BR><BR>Some birds live on mountains or in forests, as the hoopoe and the 
<A NAME="535"></A>brenthus; this latter bird finds his food with ease and has a musical voice. 
<A NAME="536"></A>The wren lives in brakes and crevices; it is difficult of capture, keeps 
<A NAME="537"></A>out of sight, is gentle of disposition, finds its food with ease, and is 
<A NAME="538"></A>something of a mechanic. It goes by the nickname of 'old man' or 'king'; 
<A NAME="539"></A>and the story goes that for this reason the eagle is at war with 
<A NAME="540"></A>him.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="541"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="542"></A><BR><BR>Some birds live on the sea-shore, as the wagtail; the bird is of 
<A NAME="543"></A>a mischievous nature, hard to capture, but when caught capable of complete 
<A NAME="544"></A>domestication; it is a cripple, as being weak in its hinder 
<A NAME="545"></A>quarters.
<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR>Web-footed birds without exception live near the sea or rivers 
<A NAME="547"></A>or pools, as they naturally resort to places adapted to their structure. 
<A NAME="548"></A>Several birds, however, with cloven toes live near pools or marshes, as, 
<A NAME="549"></A>for instance, the anthus lives by the side of rivers; the plumage of this 
<A NAME="550"></A>bird is pretty, and it finds its food with ease. The catarrhactes lives 
<A NAME="551"></A>near the sea; when it makes a dive, it will keep under water for as long 
<A NAME="552"></A>as it would take a man to walk a furlong; it is less than the common hawk. 
<A NAME="553"></A>Swans are web-footed, and live near pools and marshes; they find their 
<A NAME="554"></A>food with ease, are good-tempered, are fond of their young, and live to 
<A NAME="555"></A>a green old age. If the eagle attacks them they will repel the attack and 
<A NAME="556"></A>get the better of their assailant, but they are never the first to attack. 
<A NAME="557"></A>They are musical, and sing chiefly at the approach of death; at this time 
<A NAME="558"></A>they fly out to sea, and men, when sailing past the coast of Libya, have 
<A NAME="559"></A>fallen in with many of them out at sea singing in mournful strains, and 
<A NAME="560"></A>have actually seen some of them dying.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR>The cymindis is seldom seen, as it lives on mountains; it is black 
<A NAME="562"></A>in colour, and about the size of the hawk called the 'dove-killer'; it 
<A NAME="563"></A>is long and slender in form. The Ionians call the bird by this name; Homer 
<A NAME="564"></A>in the Iliad mentions it in the line:
<A NAME="565"></A><BR><BR><B>Chalcis its name with those of heavenly birth,</B> <B>But called 
<A NAME="566"></A>Cymindis by the sons of earth.</B>
<A NAME="567"></A><BR><BR>The hybris, said by some to be the same as the eagle-owl, is never 
<A NAME="568"></A>seen by daylight, as it is dim-sighted, but during the night it hunts like 
<A NAME="569"></A>the eagle; it will fight the eagle with such desperation that the two combatants 
<A NAME="570"></A>are often captured alive by shepherds; it lays two eggs, and, like others 
<A NAME="571"></A>we have mentioned, it builds on rocks and in caverns. Cranes also fight 
<A NAME="572"></A>so desperately among themselves as to be caught when fighting, for they 
<A NAME="573"></A>will not leave off; the crane lays two eggs.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="574"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="575"></A><BR><BR>The jay has a great variety of notes: indeed, might almost say 
<A NAME="576"></A>it had a different note for every day in the year. It lays about nine eggs; 
<A NAME="577"></A>builds its nest on trees, out of hair and tags of wool; when acorns are 
<A NAME="578"></A>getting scarce, it lays up a store of them in hiding.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR>It is a common story of the stork that the old birds are fed by 
<A NAME="580"></A>their grateful progeny. Some tell a similar story of the bee-eater, and 
<A NAME="581"></A>declare that the parents are fed by their young not only when growing old, 
<A NAME="582"></A>but at an early period, as soon as the young are capable of feeding them; 
<A NAME="583"></A>and the parent-birds stay inside the nest. The under part of the bird's 
<A NAME="584"></A>wing is pale yellow; the upper part is dark blue, like that of the halcyon; 
<A NAME="585"></A>the tips of the wings are About autumn-time it lays six or seven eggs, 
<A NAME="586"></A>in overhanging banks where the soil is soft; there it burrows into the 
<A NAME="587"></A>ground to a depth of six feet.
<A NAME="588"></A><BR><BR>The greenfinch, so called from the colour of its belly, is as large 
<A NAME="589"></A>as a lark; it lays four or five eggs, builds its nest out of the plant 
<A NAME="590"></A>called comfrey, pulling it up by the roots, and makes an under-mattress 
<A NAME="591"></A>to lie on of hair and wool. The blackbird and the jay build their nests 
<A NAME="592"></A>after the same fashion. The nest of the penduline tit shows great mechanical 
<A NAME="593"></A>skill; it has the appearance of a ball of flax, and the hole for entry 
<A NAME="594"></A>is very small.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>People who live where the bird comes from say that there exists 
<A NAME="596"></A>a cinnamon bird which brings the cinnamon from some unknown localities, 
<A NAME="597"></A>and builds its nest out of it; it builds on high trees on the slender top 
<A NAME="598"></A>branches. They say that the inhabitants attach leaden weights to the tips 
<A NAME="599"></A>of their arrows and therewith bring down the nests, and from the intertexture 
<A NAME="600"></A>collect the cinnamon sticks.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="601"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR>The halcyon is not much larger than the sparrow. Its colour is 
<A NAME="603"></A>dark blue, green, and light purple; the whole body and wings, and especially 
<A NAME="604"></A>parts about the neck, show these colours in a mixed way, without any colour 
<A NAME="605"></A>being sharply defined; the beak is light green, long and slender: such, 
<A NAME="606"></A>then, is the look of the bird. Its nest is like sea-balls, i.e. the things 
<A NAME="607"></A>that by the name of halosachne or seafoam, only the colour is not the same. 
<A NAME="608"></A>The colour of the nest is light red, and the shape is that of the long-necked 
<A NAME="609"></A>gourd. The nests are larger than the largest sponge, though they vary in 
<A NAME="610"></A>size; they are roofed over, and great part of them is solid and great part 
<A NAME="611"></A>hollow. If you use a sharp knife it is not easy to cut the nest through; 
<A NAME="612"></A>but if you cut it, and at the same time bruise it with your hand, it will 
<A NAME="613"></A>soon crumble to pieces, like the halosachne. The opening is small, just 
<A NAME="614"></A>enough for a tiny entrance, so that even if the nest upset the sea does 
<A NAME="615"></A>not enter in; the hollow channels are like those in sponges. It is not 
<A NAME="616"></A>known for certain of what material the nest is constructed; it is possibly 
<A NAME="617"></A>made of the backbones of the gar-fish; for, by the way, the bird lives 
<A NAME="618"></A>on fish. Besides living on the shore, it ascends fresh-water streams. It 
<A NAME="619"></A>lays generally about five eggs, and lays eggs all its life long, beginning 
<A NAME="620"></A>to do so at the age of four months.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="621"></A><B>Part 15</B>

<A NAME="622"></A><BR><BR>The hoopoe usually constructs its nest out of human excrement. 
<A NAME="623"></A>It changes its appearance in summer and in winter, as in fact do the great 
<A NAME="624"></A>majority of wild birds. (The titmouse is said to lay a very large quantity 
<A NAME="625"></A>of eggs: next to the ostrich the blackheaded tit is said by some to lay 
<A NAME="626"></A>the largest number of eggs; seventeen eggs have been seen; it lays, however, 
<A NAME="627"></A>more than twenty; it is said always to lay an odd number. Like others we 
<A NAME="628"></A>have mentioned, it builds in trees; it feeds on caterpillars.) A peculiarity 
<A NAME="629"></A>of this bird and of the nightingale is that the outer extremity of the 
<A NAME="630"></A>tongue is not sharp-pointed.
<A NAME="631"></A><BR><BR>The aegithus finds its food with ease, has many young, and walks 
<A NAME="632"></A>with a limp. The golden oriole is apt at learning, is clever at making 
<A NAME="633"></A>a living, but is awkward in flight and has an ugly plumage.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="634"></A><B>Part 16</B>

<A NAME="635"></A><BR><BR>The reed-warbler makes its living as easily as any other bird, 
<A NAME="636"></A>sits in summer in a shady spot facing the wind, in winter in a sunny and 
<A NAME="637"></A>sheltered place among reeds in a marsh; it is small in size, with a pleasant 
<A NAME="638"></A>note. The so-called chatterer has a pleasant note, beautiful plumage, makes 
<A NAME="639"></A>a living cleverly, and is graceful in form; it appears to be alien to our 
<A NAME="640"></A>country; at all events it is seldom seen at a distance from its own immediate 
<A NAME="641"></A>home.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="642"></A><B>Part 17</B>

<A NAME="643"></A><BR><BR>The crake is quarrelsome, clever at making a living, but in other 
<A NAME="644"></A>ways an unlucky bird. The bird called sitta is quarrelsome, but clever 
<A NAME="645"></A>and tidy, makes its living with ease, and for its knowingness is regarded 
<A NAME="646"></A>as uncanny; it has a numerous brood, of which it is fond, and lives by 
<A NAME="647"></A>pecking the bark of trees. The aegolius-owl flies by night, is seldom seen 
<A NAME="648"></A>by day; like others we have mentioned, it lives on cliffs or in caverns; 
<A NAME="649"></A>it feeds on two kinds of food; it has a strong hold on life and is full 
<A NAME="650"></A>of resource. The tree-creeper is a little bird, of fearless disposition; 
<A NAME="651"></A>it lives among trees, feeds on caterpillars, makes a living with ease, 
<A NAME="652"></A>and has a loud clear note. The acanthis finds its food with difficulty; 
<A NAME="653"></A>its plumage is poor, but its note is musical.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="654"></A><B>Part 18</B>

<A NAME="655"></A><BR><BR>Of the herons, the ashen-coloured one, as has been said, unites 
<A NAME="656"></A>with the female not without pain; it is full of resource, carries its food 
<A NAME="657"></A>with it, is eager in the quest of it, and works by day; its plumage is 
<A NAME="658"></A>poor, and its excrement is always wet. Of the other two species-for there 
<A NAME="659"></A>are three in all-the white heron has handsome plumage, unites without harm 
<A NAME="660"></A>to itself with the female, builds a nest and lays its eggs neatly in trees; 
<A NAME="661"></A>it frequents marshes and lakes and Plains and meadow land. The speckled 
<A NAME="662"></A>heron, which is nicknamed 'the skulker', is said in folklore stories to 
<A NAME="663"></A>be of servile origin, and, as its nickname implies, it is the laziest bird 
<A NAME="664"></A>of the three species. Such are the habits of herons. The bird that is called 
<A NAME="665"></A>the poynx has this peculiarity, that it is more prone than any other bird 
<A NAME="666"></A>to peck at the eyes of an assailant or its prey; it is at war with the 
<A NAME="667"></A>harpy, as the two birds live on the same food.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="668"></A><B>Part 19</B>

<A NAME="669"></A><BR><BR>There are two kinds of owsels; the one is black, and is found everywhere, 
<A NAME="670"></A>the other is quite white, about the same size as the other, and with the 
<A NAME="671"></A>same pipe. This latter is found on Cyllene in Arcadia, and is found nowhere 
<A NAME="672"></A>else. The laius, or blue-thrush, is like the black owsel, only a little 
<A NAME="673"></A>smaller; it lives on cliffs or on tile roofings; it has not a red beak 
<A NAME="674"></A>as the black owsel has.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="675"></A><B>Part 20</B>

<A NAME="676"></A><BR><BR>Of thrushes there are three species. One is the misselthrush; it 
<A NAME="677"></A>feeds only on mistletoe and resin; it is about the size of the jay. A second 
<A NAME="678"></A>is the song-thrush; it has a sharp pipe, and is about the size of the owsel. 
<A NAME="679"></A>There is another species called the Illas; it is the smallest species of 
<A NAME="680"></A>the three, and is less variegated in plumage than the 
<A NAME="681"></A>others.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="682"></A><B>Part 21</B>

<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR>There is a bird that lives on rocks, called the blue-bird from 
<A NAME="684"></A>its colour. It is comparatively common in Nisyros, and is somewhat less 
<A NAME="685"></A>than the owsel and a little bigger than the chaffinch. It has large claws, 
<A NAME="686"></A>and climbs on the face of the rocks. It is steel-blue all over; its beak 
<A NAME="687"></A>is long and slender; its legs are short, like those of the 
<A NAME="688"></A>woodpecker.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="689"></A><B>Part 22</B>

<A NAME="690"></A><BR><BR>The oriole is yellow all over; it is not visible during winter, 
<A NAME="691"></A>but puts in an appearance about the time of the summer solstice, and departs 
<A NAME="692"></A>again at the rising of Arcturus; it is the size of the turtle-dove. The 
<A NAME="693"></A>so-called soft-head (or shrike) always settles on one and the same branch, 
<A NAME="694"></A>where it falls a prey to the birdcatcher. Its head is big, and composed 
<A NAME="695"></A>of gristle; it is a little smaller than the thrush; its beak is strong, 
<A NAME="696"></A>small, and round; it is ashen-coloured all over; is fleet of foot, but 
<A NAME="697"></A>slow of wing. The bird-catcher usually catches it by help of the 
<A NAME="698"></A>owl.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="699"></A><B>Part 23</B>

<A NAME="700"></A><BR><BR>There is also the pardalus. As a rule, it is seen in flocks and 
<A NAME="701"></A>not singly; it is ashen-coloured all over, and about the size of the birds 
<A NAME="702"></A>last described; it is fleet of foot and strong of wing, and its pipe is 
<A NAME="703"></A>loud and high-pitched. The collyrion (or fieldfare) feeds on the same food 
<A NAME="704"></A>as the owsel; is of the same size as the above mentioned birds; and is 
<A NAME="705"></A>trapped usually in the winter. All these birds are found at all times. 
<A NAME="706"></A>Further, there are the birds that live as a rule in towns, the raven and 
<A NAME="707"></A>the crow. These also are visible at all seasons, never shift their place 
<A NAME="708"></A>of abode, and never go into winter quarters.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="709"></A><B>Part 24</B>

<A NAME="710"></A><BR><BR>Of daws there are three species. One is the chough; it is as large 
<A NAME="711"></A>as the crow, but has a red beak. There is another, called the 'wolf'; and 
<A NAME="712"></A>further there is the little daw, called the 'railer'. There is another 
<A NAME="713"></A>kind of daw found in Lybia and Phrygia, which is web-footed.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="714"></A><B>Part 25</B>

<A NAME="715"></A><BR><BR>Of larks there are two kinds. One lives on the ground and has a 
<A NAME="716"></A>crest on its head; the other is gregarious, and not sporadic like the first; 
<A NAME="717"></A>it is, however, of the same coloured plumage, but is smaller, and has no 
<A NAME="718"></A>crest; it is an article of human food.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="719"></A><B>Part 26</B>

<A NAME="720"></A><BR><BR>The woodcock is caught with nets in gardens. It is about the size 
<A NAME="721"></A>of a barn-door hen; it has a long beak, and in plumage is like the francolin-partridge. 
<A NAME="722"></A>It runs quickly, and is pretty easily domesticated. The starling is speckled; 
<A NAME="723"></A>it is of the same size as the owsel.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="724"></A><B>Part 27</B>

<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR>Of the Egyptian ibis there are two kinds, the white and the black. 
<A NAME="726"></A>The white ones are found over Egypt, excepting in Pelusium; the black ones 
<A NAME="727"></A>are found in Pelusium, and nowhere else in Egypt.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="728"></A><B>Part 28</B>

<A NAME="729"></A><BR><BR>Of the little horned owls there are two kinds, and one is visible 
<A NAME="730"></A>at all seasons, and for that reason has the nickname of 'all-the-year-round 
<A NAME="731"></A>owl'; it is not sufficiently palatable to come to table; another species 
<A NAME="732"></A>makes its appearance sometimes in the autumn, is seen for a single day 
<A NAME="733"></A>or at the most for two days, and is regarded as a table delicacy; it scarcely 
<A NAME="734"></A>differs from the first species save only in being fatter; it has no note, 
<A NAME="735"></A>but the other species has. With regard to their origin, nothing is known 
<A NAME="736"></A>from ocular observation; the only fact known for certain is that they are 
<A NAME="737"></A>first seen when a west wind is blowing.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="738"></A><B>Part 29</B>

<A NAME="739"></A><BR><BR>The cuckoo, as has been said elsewhere, makes no nest, but deposits 
<A NAME="740"></A>its eggs in an alien nest, generally in the nest of the ring-dove, or on 
<A NAME="741"></A>the ground in the nest of the hypolais or lark, or on a tree in the nest 
<A NAME="742"></A>of the green linnet. it lays only one egg and does not hatch it itself, 
<A NAME="743"></A>but the mother-bird in whose nest it has deposited it hatches and rears 
<A NAME="744"></A>it; and, as they say, this mother bird, when the young cuckoo has grown 
<A NAME="745"></A>big, thrusts her own brood out of the nest and lets them perish; others 
<A NAME="746"></A>say that this mother-bird kills her own brood and gives them to the alien 
<A NAME="747"></A>to devour, despising her own young owing to the beauty of the cuckoo. Personal 
<A NAME="748"></A>observers agree in telling most of these stories, but are not in agreement 
<A NAME="749"></A>as to the instruction of the young. Some say that the mother-cuckoo comes 
<A NAME="750"></A>and devours the brood of the rearing mother; others say that the young 
<A NAME="751"></A>cuckoo from its superior size snaps up the food brought before the smaller 
<A NAME="752"></A>brood have a chance, and that in consequence the smaller brood die of hunger; 
<A NAME="753"></A>others say that, by its superior strength, it actually kills the other 
<A NAME="754"></A>ones whilst it is being reared up with them. The cuckoo shows great sagacity 
<A NAME="755"></A>in the disposal of its progeny; the fact is, the mother cuckoo is quite 
<A NAME="756"></A>conscious of her own cowardice and of the fact that she could never help 
<A NAME="757"></A>her young one in an emergency, and so, for the security of the young one, 
<A NAME="758"></A>she makes of him a supposititious child in an alien nest. The truth is, 
<A NAME="759"></A>this bird is pre-eminent among birds in the way of cowardice; it allows 
<A NAME="760"></A>itself to be pecked at by little birds, and flies away from their 
<A NAME="761"></A>attacks.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="762"></A><B>Part 30</B>

<A NAME="763"></A><BR><BR>It has already been stated that the footless bird, which some term 
<A NAME="764"></A>the cypselus, resembles the swallow; indeed, it is not easy to distinguish 
<A NAME="765"></A>between the two birds, excepting in the fact that the cypselus has feathers 
<A NAME="766"></A>on the shank. These birds rear their young in long cells made of mud, and 
<A NAME="767"></A>furnished with a hole just big enough for entry and exit; they build under 
<A NAME="768"></A>cover of some roofing-under a rock or in a cavern-for protection against 
<A NAME="769"></A>animals and men.
<A NAME="770"></A><BR><BR>The so-called goat-sucker lives on mountains; it is a little larger 
<A NAME="771"></A>than the owsel, and less than the cuckoo; it lays two eggs, or three at 
<A NAME="772"></A>the most, and is of a sluggish disposition. It flies up to the she-goat 
<A NAME="773"></A>and sucks its milk, from which habit it derives its name; it is said that, 
<A NAME="774"></A>after it has sucked the teat of the animal, the teat dries up and the animal 
<A NAME="775"></A>goes blind. It is dim-sighted in the day-time, but sees well enough by 
<A NAME="776"></A>night.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="777"></A><B>Part 31</B>

<A NAME="778"></A><BR><BR>In narrow circumscribed districts where the food would be insufficient 
<A NAME="779"></A>for more birds than two, ravens are only found in isolated pairs; when 
<A NAME="780"></A>their young are old enough to fly, the parent couple first eject them from 
<A NAME="781"></A>the nest, and by and by chase them from the neighbourhood. The raven lays 
<A NAME="782"></A>four or five eggs. About the time when the mercenaries under Medius were 
<A NAME="783"></A>slaughtered at Pharsalus, the districts about Athens and the Peloponnese 
<A NAME="784"></A>were left destitute of ravens, from which it would appear that these birds 
<A NAME="785"></A>have some means of intercommunicating with one another.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="786"></A><B>Part 32</B>

<A NAME="787"></A><BR><BR>Of eagles there are several species. One of them, called 'the white-tailed 
<A NAME="788"></A>eagle', is found on low lands, in groves, and in the neighbourhood of cities; 
<A NAME="789"></A>some call it the 'heron-killer'. It is bold enough to fly to mountains 
<A NAME="790"></A>and the interior of forests. The other eagles seldom visit groves or low-lying 
<A NAME="791"></A>land. There is another species called the 'plangus'; it ranks second in 
<A NAME="792"></A>point of size and strength; it lives in mountain combes and glens, and 
<A NAME="793"></A>by marshy lakes, and goes by the name of 'duck-killer' and 'swart-eagle.' 
<A NAME="794"></A>It is mentioned by Homer in his account of the visit made by Priam to the 
<A NAME="795"></A>tent of Achilles. There is another species with black Plumage, the smallest 
<A NAME="796"></A>but boldest of all the kinds. It dwells on mountains or in forests, and 
<A NAME="797"></A>is called 'the black-eagle' or 'the hare-killer'; it is the only eagle 
<A NAME="798"></A>that rears its young and thoroughly takes them out with it. It is swift 
<A NAME="799"></A>of flight, is neat and tidy in its habits, too proud for jealousy, fearless, 
<A NAME="800"></A>quarrelsome; it is also silent, for it neither whimpers nor screams. There 
<A NAME="801"></A>is another species, the percnopterus, very large, with white head, very 
<A NAME="802"></A>short wings, long tail-feathers, in appearance like a vulture. It goes 
<A NAME="803"></A>by the name of 'mountain-stork' or 'half-eagle'. It lives in groves; has 
<A NAME="804"></A>all the bad qualities of the other species, and none of the good ones; 
<A NAME="805"></A>for it lets itself be chased and caught by the raven and the other birds. 
<A NAME="806"></A>It is clumsy in its movements, has difficulty in procuring its food, preys 
<A NAME="807"></A>on dead animals, is always hungry, and at all times whining and screaming. 
<A NAME="808"></A>There is another species, called the 'sea-eagle' or 'osprey'. This bird 
<A NAME="809"></A>has a large thick neck, curved wings, and broad tailfeathers; it lives 
<A NAME="810"></A>near the sea, grasps its prey with its talons, and often, from inability 
<A NAME="811"></A>to carry it, tumbles down into the water. There is another species called 
<A NAME="812"></A>the 'true-bred'; people say that these are the only true-bred birds to 
<A NAME="813"></A>be found, that all other birds-eagles, hawks, and the smallest birds-are 
<A NAME="814"></A>all spoilt by the interbreeding of different species. The true-bred eagle 
<A NAME="815"></A>is the largest of all eagles; it is larger than the phene; is half as large 
<A NAME="816"></A>again as the ordinary eagle, and has yellow plumage; it is seldom seen, 
<A NAME="817"></A>as is the case with the so-called cymindis. The time for an eagle to be 
<A NAME="818"></A>on the wing in search of prey is from midday to evening; in the morning 
<A NAME="819"></A>until the market-hour it remains on the nest. In old age the upper beak 
<A NAME="820"></A>of the eagle grows gradually longer and more crooked, and the bird dies 
<A NAME="821"></A>eventually of starvation; there is a folklore story that the eagle is thus 
<A NAME="822"></A>punished because it once was a man and refused entertainment to a stranger. 
<A NAME="823"></A>The eagle puts aside its superfluous food for its young; for owing to the 
<A NAME="824"></A>difficulty in procuring food day by day, it at times may come back to the 
<A NAME="825"></A>nest with nothing. If it catch a man prowling about in the neighbourhood 
<A NAME="826"></A>of its nest, it will strike him with its wings and scratch him with its 
<A NAME="827"></A>talons. The nest is built not on low ground but on an elevated spot, generally 
<A NAME="828"></A>on an inaccessible ledge of a cliff; it does, however, build upon a tree. 
<A NAME="829"></A>The young are fed until they can fly; hereupon the parent-birds topple 
<A NAME="830"></A>them out of the nest, and chase them completely out of the locality. The 
<A NAME="831"></A>fact is that a pair of eagles demands an extensive space for its maintenance, 
<A NAME="832"></A>and consequently cannot allow other birds to quarter themselves in close 
<A NAME="833"></A>neighbourhood. They do not hunt in the vicinity of their nest, but go to 
<A NAME="834"></A>a great distance to find their prey. When the eagle has captured a beast, 
<A NAME="835"></A>it puts it down without attempting to carry it off at once; if on trial 
<A NAME="836"></A>it finds the burden too heavy, it will leave it. When it has spied a hare, 
<A NAME="837"></A>it does not swoop on it at once, but lets it go on into the open ground; 
<A NAME="838"></A>neither does it descend to the ground at one swoop, but goes gradually 
<A NAME="839"></A>down from higher flights to lower and lower: these devices it adopts by 
<A NAME="840"></A>way of security against the stratagem of the hunter. It alights on high 
<A NAME="841"></A>places by reason of the difficulty it experiences in soaring up from the 
<A NAME="842"></A>level ground; it flies high in the air to have the more extensive view; 
<A NAME="843"></A>from its high flight it is said to be the only bird that resembles the 
<A NAME="844"></A>gods. Birds of prey, as a rule, seldom alight upon rock, as the crookedness 
<A NAME="845"></A>of their talons prevents a stable footing on hard stone. The eagle hunts 
<A NAME="846"></A>hares, fawns, foxes, and in general all such animals as he can master with 
<A NAME="847"></A>ease. It is a long-lived bird, and this fact might be inferred from the 
<A NAME="848"></A>length of time during which the same nest is maintained in its 
<A NAME="849"></A>place.

<A NAME="851"></A><BR><BR>In Scythia there is found a bird as large as the great bustard. 
<A NAME="852"></A>The female lays two eggs, but does not hatch them, but hides them in the 
<A NAME="853"></A>skin of a hare or fox and leaves them there, and, when it is not in quest 
<A NAME="854"></A>of prey, it keeps a watch on them on a high tree; if any man tries to climb 
<A NAME="855"></A>the tree, it fights and strikes him with its wing, just as eagles 
<A NAME="856"></A>do.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="857"></A><B>Part 34</B>

<A NAME="858"></A><BR><BR>The owl and the night-raven and all the birds see poorly in the 
<A NAME="859"></A>daytime seek their prey in the night, but not all the night through, but 
<A NAME="860"></A>at evening and dawn. Their food consists of mice, lizards, chafers and 
<A NAME="861"></A>the like little creatures. The so-called phene, or lammergeier, is fond 
<A NAME="862"></A>of its young, provides its food with ease, fetches food to its nest, and 
<A NAME="863"></A>is of a kindly disposition. It rears its own young and those of the eagle 
<A NAME="864"></A>as well; for when the eagle ejects its young from the nest, this bird catches 
<A NAME="865"></A>them up as they fall and feeds them. For the eagle, by the way, ejects 
<A NAME="866"></A>the young birds prematurely, before they are able to feed themselves, or 
<A NAME="867"></A>to fly. It appears to do so from jealousy; for it is by nature jealous, 
<A NAME="868"></A>and is so ravenous as to grab furiously at its food; and when it does grab 
<A NAME="869"></A>at its food, it grabs it in large morsels. It is accordingly jealous of 
<A NAME="870"></A>the young birds as they approach maturity, since they are getting good 
<A NAME="871"></A>appetites, and so it scratches them with its talons. The young birds fight 
<A NAME="872"></A>also with one another, to secure a morsel of food or a comfortable position, 
<A NAME="873"></A>whereupon the mother-bird beats them and ejects them from the nest; the 
<A NAME="874"></A>young ones scream at this treatment, and the phene hearing them catches 
<A NAME="875"></A>them as they fall. The phene has a film over its eyes and sees badly, but 
<A NAME="876"></A>the sea-eagle is very keen-sighted, and before its young are fledged tries 
<A NAME="877"></A>to make them stare at the sun, and beats the one that refuses to do so, 
<A NAME="878"></A>and twists him back in the sun's direction; and if one of them gets watery 
<A NAME="879"></A>eyes in the process, it kills him, and rears the other. It lives near the 
<A NAME="880"></A>sea, and feeds, as has been said, on sea-birds; when in pursuit of them 
<A NAME="881"></A>it catches them one by one, watching the moment when the bird rises to 
<A NAME="882"></A>the surface from its dive. When a sea-bird, emerging from the water, sees 
<A NAME="883"></A>the sea-eagle, he in terror dives under, intending to rise again elsewhere; 
<A NAME="884"></A>the eagle, however, owing to its keenness of vision, keeps flying after 
<A NAME="885"></A>him until he either drowns the bird or catches him on the surface. The 
<A NAME="886"></A>eagle never attacks these birds when they are in a swarm, for they keep 
<A NAME="887"></A>him off by raising a shower of water-drops with their 
<A NAME="888"></A>wings.

<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR>The cepphus is caught by means of sea-foam; the bird snaps at the 
<A NAME="891"></A>foam, and consequently fishermen catch it by sluicing with showers of sea-water. 
<A NAME="892"></A>These birds grow to be plump and fat; their flesh has a good odour, excepting 
<A NAME="893"></A>the hinder quarters, which smell of shoreweed.

<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR>Of hawks, the strongest is the buzzard; the next in point of courage 
<A NAME="896"></A>is the merlin; and the circus ranks third; other diverse kinds are the 
<A NAME="897"></A>asterias, the pigeon-hawk, and the pternis; the broaded-winged hawk is 
<A NAME="898"></A>called the half-buzzard; others go by the name of hobby-hawk, or sparrow-hawk, 
<A NAME="899"></A>or 'smooth-feathered', or 'toad-catcher'. Birds of this latter species 
<A NAME="900"></A>find their food with very little difficulty, and flutter along the ground. 
<A NAME="901"></A>Some say that there are ten species of hawks, all differing from one another. 
<A NAME="902"></A>One hawk, they say, will strike and grab the pigeon as it rests on the 
<A NAME="903"></A>ground, but never touch it while it is in flight; another hawk attacks 
<A NAME="904"></A>the pigeon when it is perched upon a tree or any elevation, but never touches 
<A NAME="905"></A>it when it is on the ground or on the wing; other hawks attack their prey 
<A NAME="906"></A>only when it is on the wing. They say that pigeons can distinguish the 
<A NAME="907"></A>various species: so that, when a hawk is an assailant, if it be one that 
<A NAME="908"></A>attacks its prey when the prey is on the wing, the pigeon will sit still; 
<A NAME="909"></A>if it be one that attacks sitting prey, the pigeon will rise up and fly 
<A NAME="910"></A>away.
<A NAME="911"></A><BR><BR>In Thrace, in the district sometimes called that of Cedripolis, 
<A NAME="912"></A>men hunt for little birds in the marshes with the aid of hawks. The men 
<A NAME="913"></A>with sticks in their hands go beating at the reeds and brushwood to frighten 
<A NAME="914"></A>the birds out, and the hawks show themselves overhead and frighten them 
<A NAME="915"></A>down. The men then strike them with their sticks and capture them. They 
<A NAME="916"></A>give a portion of their booty to the hawks; that is, they throw some of 
<A NAME="917"></A>the birds up in the air, and the hawks catch them.
<A NAME="918"></A><BR><BR>In the neighbourhood of Lake Maeotis, it is said, wolves act in 
<A NAME="919"></A>concert with the fishermen, and if the fishermen decline to share with 
<A NAME="920"></A>them, they tear their nets in pieces as they lie drying on the shore of 
<A NAME="921"></A>the lake.

<A NAME="922"></A><B>Part 37</B>

<A NAME="923"></A><BR><BR>So much for the habits of birds.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR>In marine creatures, also, one In marine creatures, also, one may observe 
<A NAME="925"></A>many ingenious devices adapted to the circumstances of their lives. For 
<A NAME="926"></A>the accounts commonly given of the so-called fishing-frog are quite true; 
<A NAME="927"></A>as are also those given of the torpedo. The fishing-frog has a set of filaments 
<A NAME="928"></A>that project in front of its eyes; they are long and thin like hairs, and 
<A NAME="929"></A>are round at the tips; they lie on either side, and are used as baits. 
<A NAME="930"></A>Accordingly, when the animal stirs up a place full of sand and mud and 
<A NAME="931"></A>conceals itself therein, it raises the filaments, and, when the little 
<A NAME="932"></A>fish strike against them, it draws them in underneath into its mouth. The 
<A NAME="933"></A>torpedo narcotizes the creatures that it wants to catch, overpowering them 
<A NAME="934"></A>by the power of shock that is resident in its body, and feeds upon them; 
<A NAME="935"></A>it also hides in the sand and mud, and catches all the creatures that swim 
<A NAME="936"></A>in its way and come under its narcotizing influence. This phenomenon has 
<A NAME="937"></A>been actually observed in operation. The sting-ray also conceals itself, 
<A NAME="938"></A>but not exactly in the same way. That the creatures get their living by 
<A NAME="939"></A>this means is obvious from the fact that, whereas they are peculiarly inactive, 
<A NAME="940"></A>they are often caught with mullets in their interior, the swiftest of fishes. 
<A NAME="941"></A>Furthermore, the fishing-frog is unusually thin when he is caught after 
<A NAME="942"></A>losing the tips of his filaments, and the torpedo is known to cause a numbness 
<A NAME="943"></A>even in human beings. Again, the hake, the ray, the flat-fish, and the 
<A NAME="944"></A>angelfish burrow in the sand, and after concealing themselves angle with 
<A NAME="945"></A>the filaments on their mouths, that fishermen call their fishing-rods, 
<A NAME="946"></A>and the little creatures on which they feed swim up to the filaments taking 
<A NAME="947"></A>them for bits of sea-weed, such as they feed upon.
<A NAME="948"></A><BR><BR>Wherever an anthias-fish is seen, there will be no dangerous creatures 
<A NAME="949"></A>in the vicinity, and sponge-divers will dive in security, and they call 
<A NAME="950"></A>these signal-fishes 'holy-fish'. It is a sort of perpetual coincidence, 
<A NAME="951"></A>like the fact that wherever snails are present you may be sure there is 
<A NAME="952"></A>neither pig nor partridge in the neighbourhood; for both pig and partridge 
<A NAME="953"></A>eat up the snails.
<A NAME="954"></A><BR><BR>The sea-serpent resembles the conger in colour and shape, but is 
<A NAME="955"></A>of lesser bulk and more rapid in its movements. If it be caught and thrown 
<A NAME="956"></A>away, it will bore a hole with its snout and burrow rapidly in the sand; 
<A NAME="957"></A>its snout, by the way, is sharper than that of ordinary serpents. The so-called 
<A NAME="958"></A>sea-scolopendra, after swallowing the hook, turns itself inside out until 
<A NAME="959"></A>it ejects it, and then it again turns itself outside in. The sea-scolopendra, 
<A NAME="960"></A>like the land-scolopendra, will come to a savoury bait; the creature does 
<A NAME="961"></A>not bite with its teeth, but stings by contact with its entire body, like 
<A NAME="962"></A>the so-called sea-nettle. The so-called fox-shark, when it finds it has 
<A NAME="963"></A>swallowed the hook, tries to get rid of it as the scolopendra does, but 
<A NAME="964"></A>not in the same way; in other words, it runs up the fishing-line, and bites 
<A NAME="965"></A>it off short; it is caught in some districts in deep and rapid waters, 
<A NAME="966"></A>with night-lines.
<A NAME="967"></A><BR><BR>The bonitos swarm together when they espy a dangerous creature, 
<A NAME="968"></A>and the largest of them swim round it, and if it touches one of the shoal 
<A NAME="969"></A>they try to repel it; they have strong teeth. Amongst other large fish, 
<A NAME="970"></A>a lamia-shark, after falling in amongst a shoal, has been seen to be covered 
<A NAME="971"></A>with wounds.
<A NAME="972"></A><BR><BR>Of river-fish, the male of the sheat-fish is remarkably attentive 
<A NAME="973"></A>to the young. The female after parturition goes away; the male stays and 
<A NAME="974"></A>keeps on guard where the spawn is most abundant, contenting himself with 
<A NAME="975"></A>keeping off all other little fishes that might steal the spawn or fry, 
<A NAME="976"></A>and this he does for forty or fifty days, until the young are sufficiently 
<A NAME="977"></A>grown to make away from the other fishes for themselves. The fishermen 
<A NAME="978"></A>can tell where he is on guard: for, in warding off the little fishes, he 
<A NAME="979"></A>makes a rush in the water and gives utterance to a kind of muttering noise. 
<A NAME="980"></A>He is so earnest in the performance of his parental duties that the fishermen 
<A NAME="981"></A>at times, if the eggs be attached to the roots of water-plants deep in 
<A NAME="982"></A>the water, drag them into as shallow a place as possible; the male fish 
<A NAME="983"></A>will still keep by the young, and, if it so happen, will be caught by the 
<A NAME="984"></A>hook when snapping at the little fish that come by; if, however, he be 
<A NAME="985"></A>sensible by experience of the danger of the hook, he will still keep by 
<A NAME="986"></A>his charge, and with his extremely strong teeth will bite the hook in 
<A NAME="987"></A>pieces.
<A NAME="988"></A><BR><BR>All fishes, both those that wander about and those that are stationary, 
<A NAME="989"></A>occupy the districts where they were born or very similar places, for their 
<A NAME="990"></A>natural food is found there. Carnivorous fish wander most; and all fish 
<A NAME="991"></A>are carnivorous with the exception of a few, such as the mullet, the saupe, 
<A NAME="992"></A>the red mullet, and the chalcis. The so-called pholis gives out a mucous 
<A NAME="993"></A>discharge, which envelops the creature in a kind of nest. Of shell-fish, 
<A NAME="994"></A>and fish that are finless, the scallop moves with greatest force and to 
<A NAME="995"></A>the greatest distance, impelled along by some internal energy; the murex 
<A NAME="996"></A>or purple-fish, and others that resemble it, move hardly at all. Out of 
<A NAME="997"></A>the lagoon of Pyrrha all the fishes swim in winter-time, except the sea-gudgeon; 
<A NAME="998"></A>they swim out owing to the cold, for the narrow waters are colder than 
<A NAME="999"></A>the outer sea, and on the return of the early summer they all swim back 
<A NAME="1000"></A>again. In the lagoon no scarus is found, nor thritta, nor any other species 
<A NAME="1001"></A>of the spiny fish, no spotted dogfish, no spiny dogfish, no sea-crawfish, 
<A NAME="1002"></A>no octopus either of the common or the musky kinds, and certain other fish 
<A NAME="1003"></A>are also absent; but of fish that are found in the lagoon the white gudgeon 
<A NAME="1004"></A>is not a marine fish. Of fishes the oviparous are in their prime in the 
<A NAME="1005"></A>early summer until the spawning time; the viviparous in the autumn, as 
<A NAME="1006"></A>is also the case with the mullet, the red mullet, and all such fish. In 
<A NAME="1007"></A>the neighbourhood of Lesbos, the fishes of the outer sea, or of the lagoon, 
<A NAME="1008"></A>bring forth their eggs or young in the lagoon; sexual union takes place 
<A NAME="1009"></A>in the autumn, and parturition in the spring. With fishes of the cartilaginous 
<A NAME="1010"></A>kind, the males and females swarm together in the autumn for the sake of 
<A NAME="1011"></A>sexual union; in the early summer they come swimming in, and keep apart 
<A NAME="1012"></A>until after parturition; the two sexes are often taken linked together 
<A NAME="1013"></A>in sexual union.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>Of molluscs the sepia is the most cunning, and is the only species 
<A NAME="1015"></A>that employs its dark liquid for the sake of concealment as well as from 
<A NAME="1016"></A>fear: the octopus and calamary make the discharge solely from fear. These 
<A NAME="1017"></A>creatures never discharge the pigment in its entirety; and after a discharge 
<A NAME="1018"></A>the pigment accumulates again. The sepia, as has been said, often uses 
<A NAME="1019"></A>its colouring pigment for concealment; it shows itself in front of the 
<A NAME="1020"></A>pigment and then retreats back into it; it also hunts with its long tentacles 
<A NAME="1021"></A>not only little fishes, but oftentimes even mullets. The octopus is a stupid 
<A NAME="1022"></A>creature, for it will approach a man's hand if it be lowered in the water; 
<A NAME="1023"></A>but it is neat and thrifty in its habits: that is, it lays up stores in 
<A NAME="1024"></A>its nest, and, after eating up all that is eatable, it ejects the shells 
<A NAME="1025"></A>and sheaths of crabs and shell-fish, and the skeletons of little fishes. 
<A NAME="1026"></A>It seeks its prey by so changing its colour as to render it like the colour 
<A NAME="1027"></A>of the stones adjacent to it; it does so also when alarmed. By some the 
<A NAME="1028"></A>sepia is said to perform the same trick; that is, they say it can change 
<A NAME="1029"></A>its colour so as to make it resemble the colour of its habitat. The only 
<A NAME="1030"></A>fish that can do this is the angelfish, that is, it can change its colour 
<A NAME="1031"></A>like the octopus. The octopus as a rule does not live the year out. It 
<A NAME="1032"></A>has a natural tendency to run off into liquid; for, if beaten and squeezed, 
<A NAME="1033"></A>it keeps losing substance and at last disappears. The female after parturition 
<A NAME="1034"></A>is peculiarly subject to this colliquefaction; it becomes stupid; if tossed 
<A NAME="1035"></A>about by waves, it submits impassively; a man, if he dived, could catch 
<A NAME="1036"></A>it with the hand; it gets covered over with slime, and makes no effort 
<A NAME="1037"></A>to catch its wonted prey. The male becomes leathery and clammy. As a proof 
<A NAME="1038"></A>that they do not live into a second year there is the fact that, after 
<A NAME="1039"></A>the birth of the little octopuses in the late summer or beginning of autumn, 
<A NAME="1040"></A>it is seldom that a large-sized octopus is visible, whereas a little before 
<A NAME="1041"></A>this time of year the creature is at its largest. After the eggs are laid, 
<A NAME="1042"></A>they say that both the male and the female grow so old and feeble that 
<A NAME="1043"></A>they are preyed upon by little fish, and with ease dragged from their holes; 
<A NAME="1044"></A>and that this could not have been done previously; they say also that this 
<A NAME="1045"></A>is not the case with the small and young octopus, but that the young creature 
<A NAME="1046"></A>is much stronger than the grown-up one. Neither does the sepia live into 
<A NAME="1047"></A>a second year. The octopus is the only mollusc that ventures on to dry 
<A NAME="1048"></A>land; it walks by preference on rough ground; it is firm all over when 
<A NAME="1049"></A>you squeeze it, excepting in the neck. So much for the 
<A NAME="1050"></A>mollusca.
<A NAME="1051"></A><BR><BR>It is also said that they make a thin rough shell about them like 
<A NAME="1052"></A>a hard sheath, and that this is made larger and larger as the animal grows 
<A NAME="1053"></A>larger, and that it comes out of the sheath as though out of a den or dwelling 
<A NAME="1054"></A>place.
<A NAME="1055"></A><BR><BR>The nautilus (or argonaut) is a poulpe or octopus, but one peculiar 
<A NAME="1056"></A>both in its nature and its habits. It rises up from deep water and swims 
<A NAME="1057"></A>on the surface; it rises with its shell down-turned in order that it may 
<A NAME="1058"></A>rise the more easily and swim with it empty, but after reaching the surface 
<A NAME="1059"></A>it shifts the position of the shell. In between its feelers it has a certain 
<A NAME="1060"></A>amount of web-growth, resembling the substance between the toes of web-footed 
<A NAME="1061"></A>birds; only that with these latter the substance is thick, while with the 
<A NAME="1062"></A>nautilus it is thin and like a spider's web. It uses this structure, when 
<A NAME="1063"></A>a breeze is blowing, for a sail, and lets down some of its feelers alongside 
<A NAME="1064"></A>as rudder-oars. If it be frightened it fills its shell with water and sinks. 
<A NAME="1065"></A>With regard to the mode of generation and the growth of the shell knowledge 
<A NAME="1066"></A>from observation is not yet satisfactory; the shell, however, does not 
<A NAME="1067"></A>appear to be there from the beginning, but to grow in their cases as in 
<A NAME="1068"></A>that of other shell-fish; neither is it ascertained for certain whether 
<A NAME="1069"></A>the animal can live when stripped of the shell.

<A NAME="1071"></A><BR><BR>Of all insects, one may also say of all living creatures, the most 
<A NAME="1072"></A>industrious are the ant, the bee, the hornet, the wasp, and in point of 
<A NAME="1073"></A>fact all creatures akin to these; of spiders some are more skilful and 
<A NAME="1074"></A>more resourceful than others. The way in which ants work is open to ordinary 
<A NAME="1075"></A>observation; how they all march one after the other when they are engaged 
<A NAME="1076"></A>in putting away and storing up their food; all this may be seen, for they

<A NAME="1079"></A><BR><BR>Of spiders and phalangia there are many species. Of the venomous 
<A NAME="1080"></A>phalangia there are two; one that resembles the so-called wolf-spider, 
<A NAME="1081"></A>small, speckled, and tapering to a point; it moves with leaps, from which 
<A NAME="1082"></A>habit it is nicknamed 'the flea': the other kind is large, black in colour, 
<A NAME="1083"></A>with long front legs; it is heavy in its movements, walks slowly, is not 
<A NAME="1084"></A>very strong, and never leaps. (Of all the other species wherewith poison-vendors 
<A NAME="1085"></A>supply themselves, some give a weak bite, and others never bite at all. 
<A NAME="1086"></A>There is another kind, comprising the so-called wolf-spiders.) Of these 
<A NAME="1087"></A>spiders the small one weaves no web, and the large weaves a rude and poorly 
<A NAME="1088"></A>built one on the ground or on dry stone walls. It always builds its web 
<A NAME="1089"></A>over hollow places inside of which it keeps a watch on the end-threads, 
<A NAME="1090"></A>until some creature gets into the web and begins to struggle, when out 
<A NAME="1091"></A>the spider pounces. The speckled kind makes a little shabby web under 
<A NAME="1092"></A>trees.
<A NAME="1093"></A><BR><BR>There is a third species of this animal, preeminently clever and 
<A NAME="1094"></A>artistic. It first weaves a thread stretching to all the exterior ends 
<A NAME="1095"></A>of the future web; then from the centre, which it hits upon with great 
<A NAME="1096"></A>accuracy, it stretches the warp; on the warp it puts what corresponds to 
<A NAME="1097"></A>the woof, and then weaves the whole together. It sleeps and stores its 
<A NAME="1098"></A>food away from the centre, but it is at the centre that it keeps watch 
<A NAME="1099"></A>for its prey. Then, when any creature touches the web and the centre is 
<A NAME="1100"></A>set in motion, it first ties and wraps the creature round with threads 
<A NAME="1101"></A>until it renders it helpless, then lifts it and carries it off, and, if 
<A NAME="1102"></A>it happens to be hungry, sucks out the life-juices--for that is the way 
<A NAME="1103"></A>it feeds; but, if it be not hungry, it first mends any damage done and 
<A NAME="1104"></A>then hastens again to its quest of prey. If something comes meanwhile into 
<A NAME="1105"></A>the net, the spider at first makes for the centre, and then goes back to 
<A NAME="1106"></A>its entangled prey as from a fixed starting point. If any one injures a 
<A NAME="1107"></A>portion of the web, it recommences weaving at sunrise or at sunset, because 
<A NAME="1108"></A>it is chiefly at these periods that creatures are caught in the web. It 
<A NAME="1109"></A>is the female that does the weaving and the hunting, but the male takes 
<A NAME="1110"></A>a share of the booty captured.
<A NAME="1111"></A><BR><BR>Of the skilful spiders, weaving a substantial web, there are two 
<A NAME="1112"></A>kinds, the larger and the smaller. The one has long legs and keeps watch 
<A NAME="1113"></A>while swinging downwards from the web: from its large size it cannot easily 
<A NAME="1114"></A>conceal itself, and so it keeps underneath, so that its prey may not be 
<A NAME="1115"></A>frightened off, but may strike upon the web's upper surface; the less awkwardly 
<A NAME="1116"></A>formed one lies in wait on the top, using a little hole for a lurking-place. 
<A NAME="1117"></A>Spiders can spin webs from the time of their birth, not from their interior 
<A NAME="1118"></A>as a superfluity or excretion, as Democritus avers, but off their body 
<A NAME="1119"></A>as a kind of tree-bark, like the creatures that shoot out with their hair, 
<A NAME="1120"></A>as for instance the porcupine. The creature can attack animals larger than 
<A NAME="1121"></A>itself, and enwrap them with its threads: in other words, it will attack 
<A NAME="1122"></A>a small lizard, run round and draw threads about its mouth until it closes
