<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>The question whether the attribute stated is or is not a property, should 
<A NAME="12"></A>be examined by the following methods:
<A NAME="13"></A><BR><BR>Any 'property' rendered is always either essential and permanent 
<A NAME="14"></A>or relative and temporary: e.g. it is an 'essential property' of man to 
<A NAME="15"></A>be 'by nature a civilized animal': a 'relative property' is one like that 
<A NAME="16"></A>of the soul in relation to the body, viz. that the one is fitted to command, 
<A NAME="17"></A>and the other to obey: a 'permanent property' is one like the property 
<A NAME="18"></A>which belongs to God, of being an 'immortal living being': a 'temporary 
<A NAME="19"></A>property' is one like the property which belongs to any particular man 
<A NAME="20"></A>of walking in the gymnasium.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>[The rendering of a property 'relatively' gives rise either to 
<A NAME="22"></A>two problems or to four. For if he at the same time render this property 
<A NAME="23"></A>of one thing and deny it of another, only two problems arise, as in the 
<A NAME="24"></A>case of a statement that it is a property of a man, in relation to a horse, 
<A NAME="25"></A>to be a biped. For one might try both to show that a man is not a biped, 
<A NAME="26"></A>and also that a horse is a biped: in both ways the property would be upset. 
<A NAME="27"></A>If on the other hand he render one apiece of two attributes to each of 
<A NAME="28"></A>two things, and deny it in each case of the other, there will then be four 
<A NAME="29"></A>problems; as in the case of a statement that it is a property of a man 
<A NAME="30"></A>in relation to a horse for the former to be a biped and the latter a quadruped. 
<A NAME="31"></A>For then it is possible to try to show both that a man is not naturally 
<A NAME="32"></A>a biped, and that he is a quadruped, and also that the horse both is a 
<A NAME="33"></A>biped, and is not a quadruped. If you show any of these at all, the intended 
<A NAME="34"></A>attribute is demolished.]
<A NAME="35"></A><BR><BR>An 'essential' property is one which is rendered of a thing in 
<A NAME="36"></A>comparison with everything else and distinguishes the said thing from everything 
<A NAME="37"></A>else, as does 'a mortal living being capable of receiving knowledge' in 
<A NAME="38"></A>the case of man. A 'relative' property is one which separates its subject 
<A NAME="39"></A>off not from everything else but only from a particular definite thing, 
<A NAME="40"></A>as does the property which virtue possesses, in comparison with knowledge, 
<A NAME="41"></A>viz. that the former is naturally produced in more than one faculty, whereas 
<A NAME="42"></A>the latter is produced in that of reason alone, and in those who have a 
<A NAME="43"></A>reasoning faculty. A 'permanent' property is one which is true at every 
<A NAME="44"></A>time, and never fails, like being' compounded of soul and body', in the 
<A NAME="45"></A>case of a living creature. A 'temporary' property is one which is true 
<A NAME="46"></A>at some particular time, and does not of necessity always follow; as, of 
<A NAME="47"></A>some particular man, that he walks in the market-place.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>To render a property 'relatively' to something else means to state 
<A NAME="49"></A>the difference between them as it is found either universally and always, 
<A NAME="50"></A>or generally and in most cases: thus a difference that is found universally 
<A NAME="51"></A>and always, is one such as man possesses in comparison with a horse, viz. 
<A NAME="52"></A>being a biped: for a man is always and in every case a biped, whereas a 
<A NAME="53"></A>horse is never a biped at any time. On the other hand, a difference that 
<A NAME="54"></A>is found generally and in most cases, is one such as the faculty of reason 
<A NAME="55"></A>possesses in comparison with that of desire and spirit, in that the former 
<A NAME="56"></A>commands, while the latter obeys: for the reasoning faculty does not always 
<A NAME="57"></A>command, but sometimes also is under command, nor is that of desire and 
<A NAME="58"></A>spirit always under command, but also on occasion assumes the command, 
<A NAME="59"></A>whenever the soul of a man is vicious.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>Of 'properties' the most 'arguable' are the essential and permanent 
<A NAME="61"></A>and the relative. For a relative property gives rise, as we said before, 
<A NAME="62"></A>to several questions: for of necessity the questions arising are either 
<A NAME="63"></A>two or four, or that arguments in regard to these are several. An essential 
<A NAME="64"></A>and a permanent property you can discuss in relation to many things, or 
<A NAME="65"></A>can observe in relation to many periods of time: if essential', discuss 
<A NAME="66"></A>it in comparison with many things: for the property ought to belong to 
<A NAME="67"></A>its subject in comparison with every single thing that is, so that if the 
<A NAME="68"></A>subject be not distinguished by it in comparison with everything else, 
<A NAME="69"></A>the property could not have been rendered correctly. So a permanent property 
<A NAME="70"></A>you should observe in relation to many periods of time; for if it does 
<A NAME="71"></A>not or did not, or is not going to, belong, it will not be a property. 
<A NAME="72"></A>On the other hand, about a temporary property we do not inquire further 
<A NAME="73"></A>than in regard to the time called 'the present'; and so arguments in regard 
<A NAME="74"></A>to it are not many; whereas an arguable' question is one in regard to which 
<A NAME="75"></A>it is possible for arguments both numerous and good to 
<A NAME="76"></A>arise.
<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>The so-called 'relative' property, then, should be examined by 
<A NAME="78"></A>means of the commonplace arguments relating to Accident, to see whether 
<A NAME="79"></A>it belongs to the one thing and not to the other: on the other hand, permanent 
<A NAME="80"></A>and essential properties should be considered by the following 
<A NAME="81"></A>methods.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="82"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="83"></A><BR><BR>First, see whether the property has or has not been rendered correctly. 
<A NAME="84"></A>Of a rendering being incorrect or correct, one test is to see whether the 
<A NAME="85"></A>terms in which the property is stated are not or are more intelligible-for 
<A NAME="86"></A>destructive purposes, whether they are not so, and for constructive purposes, 
<A NAME="87"></A>whether they are so. Of the terms not being more intelligible, one test 
<A NAME="88"></A>is to see whether the property which he renders is altogether more unintelligible 
<A NAME="89"></A>than the subject whose property he has stated: for, if so, the property 
<A NAME="90"></A>will not have been stated correctly. For the object of getting a property 
<A NAME="91"></A>constituted is to be intelligible: the terms therefore in which it is rendered 
<A NAME="92"></A>should be more intelligible: for in that case it will be possible to conceive 
<A NAME="93"></A>it more adequately, e.g. any one who has stated that it is a property of 
<A NAME="94"></A>'fire' to 'bear a very close resemblance to the soul', uses the term 'soul', 
<A NAME="95"></A>which is less intelligible than 'fire'-for we know better what fire is 
<A NAME="96"></A>than what soul is-, and therefore a 'very close resemblance to the soul' 
<A NAME="97"></A>could not be correctly stated to be a property of fire. Another test is 
<A NAME="98"></A>to see whether the attribution of A (property) to B (subject) fails to 
<A NAME="99"></A>be more intelligible. For not only should the property be more intelligible 
<A NAME="100"></A>than its subject, but also it should be something whose attribution to 
<A NAME="101"></A>the particular subject is a more intelligible attribution. For he who does 
<A NAME="102"></A>not know whether it is an attribute of the particular subject at all, will 
<A NAME="103"></A>not know either whether it belongs to it alone, so that whichever of these 
<A NAME="104"></A>results happens, its character as a property becomes obscure. Thus (e.g.) 
<A NAME="105"></A>a man who has stated that it is a property of fire to be 'the primary element 
<A NAME="106"></A>wherein the soul is naturally found', has introduced a subject which is 
<A NAME="107"></A>less intelligible than 'fire', viz. whether the soul is found in it, and 
<A NAME="108"></A>whether it is found there primarily; and therefore to be 'the primary element 
<A NAME="109"></A>in which the soul is naturally found' could not be correctly stated to 
<A NAME="110"></A>be a property of 'fire'. On the other hand, for constructive purposes, 
<A NAME="111"></A>see whether the terms in which the property is stated are more intelligible, 
<A NAME="112"></A>and if they are more intelligible in each of the aforesaid ways. For then 
<A NAME="113"></A>the property will have been correctly stated in this respect: for of constructive 
<A NAME="114"></A>arguments, showing the correctness of a rendering, some will show the correctness 
<A NAME="115"></A>merely in this respect, while others will show it without qualification. 
<A NAME="116"></A>Thus (e.g.) a man who has said that the 'possession of sensation' is a 
<A NAME="117"></A>property of 'animal' has both used more intelligible terms and has rendered 
<A NAME="118"></A>the property more intelligible in each of the aforesaid senses; so that 
<A NAME="119"></A>to 'possess sensation' would in this respect have been correctly rendered 
<A NAME="120"></A>as a property of 'animal'.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see whether any of the terms rendered 
<A NAME="122"></A>in the property is used in more than one sense, or whether the whole expression 
<A NAME="123"></A>too signifies more than one thing. For then the property will not have 
<A NAME="124"></A>been correctly stated. Thus (e.g.) seeing that to 'being natural sentient' 
<A NAME="125"></A>signifies more than one thing, viz. (1) to possess sensation, (2) to use 
<A NAME="126"></A>one's sensation, being naturally sentient' could not be a correct statement 
<A NAME="127"></A>of a property of 'animal'. The reason why the term you use, or the whole 
<A NAME="128"></A>expression signifying the property, should not bear more than one meaning 
<A NAME="129"></A>is this, that an expression bearing more than one meaning makes the object 
<A NAME="130"></A>described obscure, because the man who is about to attempt an argument 
<A NAME="131"></A>is in doubt which of the various senses the expression bears: and this 
<A NAME="132"></A>will not do, for the object of rendering the property is that he may understand. 
<A NAME="133"></A>Moreover, in addition to this, it is inevitable that those who render a 
<A NAME="134"></A>property after this fashion should be somehow refuted whenever any one 
<A NAME="135"></A>addresses his syllogism to that one of the term's several meanings which 
<A NAME="136"></A>does not agree. For constructive purposes, on the other hand, see whether 
<A NAME="137"></A>both all the terms and also the expression as a whole avoid bearing more 
<A NAME="138"></A>than one sense: for then the property will have been correctly stated in 
<A NAME="139"></A>this respect. Thus (e.g.) seeing that 'body' does not bear several meanings, 
<A NAME="140"></A>nor quickest to move upwards in space', nor yet the whole expression made 
<A NAME="141"></A>by putting them together, it would be correct in this respect to say that 
<A NAME="142"></A>it is a property of fire to be the 'body quickest to move upwards in 
<A NAME="143"></A>space'.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see if the term of which he renders 
<A NAME="145"></A>the property is used in more than one sense, and no distinction has been 
<A NAME="146"></A>drawn as to which of them it is whose property he is stating: for then 
<A NAME="147"></A>the property will not have been correctly rendered. The reasons why this 
<A NAME="148"></A>is so are quite clear from what has been said above: for the same results 
<A NAME="149"></A>are bound to follow. Thus (e.g.) seeing that 'the knowledge of this' signifies 
<A NAME="150"></A>many things for it means (1) the possession of knowledge by it, (2) the 
<A NAME="151"></A>use of its knowledge by it, (3) the existence of knowledge about it, (4) 
<A NAME="152"></A>the use of knowledge about it-no property of the 'knowledge of this' could 
<A NAME="153"></A>be rendered correctly unless he draw a distinction as to which of these 
<A NAME="154"></A>it is whose property he is rendering. For constructive purposes, a man 
<A NAME="155"></A>should see if the term of which he is rendering the property avoids bearing 
<A NAME="156"></A>many senses and is one and simple: for then the property will have been 
<A NAME="157"></A>correctly stated in this respect. Thus (e.g.) seeing that 'man' is used 
<A NAME="158"></A>in a single sense, 'naturally civilized animal' would be correctly stated 
<A NAME="159"></A>as a property of man.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see whether the same term has been 
<A NAME="161"></A>repeated in the property. For people often do this undetected in rendering 
<A NAME="162"></A>'properties' also, just as they do in their 'definitions' as well: but 
<A NAME="163"></A>a property to which this has happened will not have been correctly stated: 
<A NAME="164"></A>for the repetition of it confuses the hearer; thus inevitably the meaning 
<A NAME="165"></A>becomes obscure, and further, such people are thought to babble. Repetition 
<A NAME="166"></A>of the same term is likely to happen in two ways; one is, when a man repeatedly 
<A NAME="167"></A>uses the same word, as would happen if any one were to render, as a property 
<A NAME="168"></A>of fire, 'the body which is the most rarefied of bodies' (for he has repeated 
<A NAME="169"></A>the word 'body'); the second is, if a man replaces words by their definitions, 
<A NAME="170"></A>as would happen if any one were to render, as a property of earth, 'the 
<A NAME="171"></A>substance which is by its nature most easily of all bodies borne downwards 
<A NAME="172"></A>in space', and were then to substitute 'substances of such and such a kind' 
<A NAME="173"></A>for the word 'bodies': for 'body' and 'a substance of such and such a kind' 
<A NAME="174"></A>mean one and the same thing. For he will have repeated the word 'substance', 
<A NAME="175"></A>and accordingly neither of the properties would be correctly stated. For 
<A NAME="176"></A>constructive purposes, on the other hand, see whether he avoids ever repeating 
<A NAME="177"></A>the same term; for then the property will in this respect have been correctly 
<A NAME="178"></A>rendered. Thus (e.g.) seeing that he who has stated 'animal capable of 
<A NAME="179"></A>acquiring knowledge' as a property of man has avoided repeating the same 
<A NAME="180"></A>term several times, the property would in this respect have been correctly 
<A NAME="181"></A>rendered of man.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see whether he has rendered in 
<A NAME="183"></A>the property any such term as is a universal attribute. For one which does 
<A NAME="184"></A>not distinguish its subject from other things is useless, and it is the 
<A NAME="185"></A>business of the language Of 'properties', as also of the language of definitions, 
<A NAME="186"></A>to distinguish. In the case contemplated, therefore, the property will 
<A NAME="187"></A>not have been correctly rendered. Thus (e.g.) a man who has stated that 
<A NAME="188"></A>it is a property of knowledge to be a 'conception incontrovertible by argument, 
<A NAME="189"></A>because of its unity', has used in the property a term of that kind, viz. 
<A NAME="190"></A>'unity', which is a universal attribute; and therefore the property of 
<A NAME="191"></A>knowledge could not have been correctly stated. For constructive purposes, 
<A NAME="192"></A>on the other hand, see whether he has avoided all terms that are common 
<A NAME="193"></A>to everything and used a term that distinguishes the subject from something: 
<A NAME="194"></A>for then the property will in this respect have been correctly stated. 
<A NAME="195"></A>Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as he who has said that it is a property of a 'living 
<A NAME="196"></A>creature' to 'have a soul' has used no term that is common to everything, 
<A NAME="197"></A>it would in this respect have been correctly stated to be a property of 
<A NAME="198"></A>a 'living creature' to 'have a soul'.
<A NAME="199"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes see whether he renders more than 
<A NAME="200"></A>one property of the same thing, without a definite proviso that he is stating 
<A NAME="201"></A>more than one: for then the property will not have been correctly stated. 
<A NAME="202"></A>For just as in the case of definitions too there should be no further addition 
<A NAME="203"></A>beside the expression which shows the essence, so too in the case of properties 
<A NAME="204"></A>nothing further should be rendered beside the expression that constitutes 
<A NAME="205"></A>the property mentioned: for such an addition is made to no purpose. Thus 
<A NAME="206"></A>(e.g.) a man who has said that it is a property of fire to be 'the most 
<A NAME="207"></A>rarefied and lightest body' has rendered more than one property (for each 
<A NAME="208"></A>term is a true predicate of fire alone); and so it could not be a correctly 
<A NAME="209"></A>stated property of fire to be 'the most rarefied and lightest body'. On 
<A NAME="210"></A>the other hand, for constructive purposes, see whether he has avoided rendering 
<A NAME="211"></A>more than one property of the same thing, and has rendered one only: for 
<A NAME="212"></A>then the property will in this respect have been correctly stated. Thus 
<A NAME="213"></A>(e.g.) a man who has said that it is a property of a liquid to be a 'body 
<A NAME="214"></A>adaptable to every shape' has rendered as its property a single character 
<A NAME="215"></A>and not several, and so the property of 'liquid' would in this respect 
<A NAME="216"></A>have been correctly stated.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="217"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="218"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see whether he has employed either 
<A NAME="219"></A>the actual subject whose property he is rendering, or any of its species: 
<A NAME="220"></A>for then the property will not have been correctly stated. For the object 
<A NAME="221"></A>of rendering the property is that people may understand: now the subject 
<A NAME="222"></A>itself is just as unintelligible as it was to start with, while any one 
<A NAME="223"></A>of its species is posterior to it, and so is no more intelligible. Accordingly 
<A NAME="224"></A>it is impossible to understand anything further by the use of these terms. 
<A NAME="225"></A>Thus (e.g.) any one who has said that it is property of 'animal' to be 
<A NAME="226"></A>'the substance to which "man" belongs as a species' has employed one of 
<A NAME="227"></A>its species, and therefore the property could not have been correctly stated. 
<A NAME="228"></A>For constructive purposes, on the other hand, see whether he avoids introducing 
<A NAME="229"></A>either the subject itself or any of its species: for then the property 
<A NAME="230"></A>will in this respect have been correctly stated. Thus (e.g.) a man who 
<A NAME="231"></A>has stated that it is a property of a living creature to be 'compounded 
<A NAME="232"></A>of soul and body' has avoided introducing among the rest either the subject 
<A NAME="233"></A>itself or any of its species, and therefore in this respect the property 
<A NAME="234"></A>of a 'living creature' would have been correctly rendered.
<A NAME="235"></A><BR><BR>You should inquire in the same way also in the case of other terms 
<A NAME="236"></A>that do or do not make the subject more intelligible: thus, for destructive 
<A NAME="237"></A>purposes, see whether he has employed anything either opposite to the subject 
<A NAME="238"></A>or, in general, anything simultaneous by nature with it or posterior to 
<A NAME="239"></A>it: for then the property will not have been correctly stated. For an opposite 
<A NAME="240"></A>is simultaneous by nature with its opposite, and what is simultaneous by 
<A NAME="241"></A>nature or is posterior to it does not make its subject more intelligible. 
<A NAME="242"></A>Thus (e.g.) any one who has said that it is a property of good to be 'the 
<A NAME="243"></A>most direct opposite of evil', has employed the opposite of good, and so 
<A NAME="244"></A>the property of good could not have been correctly rendered. For constructive 
<A NAME="245"></A>purposes, on the other hand, see whether he has avoided employing anything 
<A NAME="246"></A>either opposite to, or, in general, simultaneous by nature with the subject, 
<A NAME="247"></A>or posterior to it: for then the property will in this respect have been 
<A NAME="248"></A>correctly rendered. Thus (e.g.) a man who has stated that it is a property 
<A NAME="249"></A>of knowledge to be 'the most convincing conception' has avoided employing 
<A NAME="250"></A>anything either opposite to, or simultaneous by nature with, or posterior 
<A NAME="251"></A>to, the subject; and so the property of knowledge would in this respect 
<A NAME="252"></A>have been correctly stated.
<A NAME="253"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see whether he has rendered as 
<A NAME="254"></A>property something that does not always follow the subject but sometimes 
<A NAME="255"></A>ceases to be its property: for then the property will not have been correctly 
<A NAME="256"></A>described. For there is no necessity either that the name of the subject 
<A NAME="257"></A>must also be true of anything to which we find such an attribute belonging; 
<A NAME="258"></A>nor yet that the name of the subject will be untrue of anything to which 
<A NAME="259"></A>such an attribute is found not to belong. Moreover, in addition to this, 
<A NAME="260"></A>even after he has rendered the property it will not be clear whether it 
<A NAME="261"></A>belongs, seeing that it is the kind of attribute that may fall: and so 
<A NAME="262"></A>the property will not be clear. Thus (e.g.) a man who has stated that it 
<A NAME="263"></A>is a property of animal 'sometimes to move and sometimes to stand still' 
<A NAME="264"></A>rendered the kind of property which sometimes is not a property, and so 
<A NAME="265"></A>the property could not have been correctly stated. For constructive purposes, 
<A NAME="266"></A>on the other hand, see whether he has rendered something that of necessity 
<A NAME="267"></A>must always be a property: for then the property will have been in this 
<A NAME="268"></A>respect correctly stated. Thus (e.g.) a man who has stated that it is a 
<A NAME="269"></A>property of virtue to be 'what makes its possessor good' has rendered as 
<A NAME="270"></A>property something that always follows, and so the property of virtue would 
<A NAME="271"></A>in this respect have been correctly rendered.
<A NAME="272"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see whether in rendering the property 
<A NAME="273"></A>of the present time he has omitted to make a definite proviso that it is 
<A NAME="274"></A>the property of the present time which he is rendering: for else the property 
<A NAME="275"></A>will not have been correctly stated. For in the first place, any unusual 
<A NAME="276"></A>procedure always needs a definite proviso: and it is the usual procedure 
<A NAME="277"></A>for everybody to render as property some attribute that always follows. 
<A NAME="278"></A>In the second place, a man who omits to provide definitely whether it was 
<A NAME="279"></A>the property of the present time which he intended to state, is obscure: 
<A NAME="280"></A>and one should not give any occasion for adverse criticism. Thus (e.g.) 
<A NAME="281"></A>a man who has stated it as the property of a particular man 'to be sitting 
<A NAME="282"></A>with a particular man', states the property of the present time, and so 
<A NAME="283"></A>he cannot have rendered the property correctly, seeing that he has described 
<A NAME="284"></A>it without any definite proviso. For constructive purposes, on the other 
<A NAME="285"></A>hand, see whether, in rendering the property of the present time, he has, 
<A NAME="286"></A>in stating it, made a definite proviso that it is the property of the present 
<A NAME="287"></A>time that he is stating: for then the property will in this respect have 
<A NAME="288"></A>been correctly stated. Thus (e.g.) a man who has said that it is the property 
<A NAME="289"></A>of a particular man 'to be walking now', has made this distinction in his 
<A NAME="290"></A>statement, and so the property would have been correctly 
<A NAME="291"></A>stated.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see whether he has rendered a property 
<A NAME="293"></A>of the kind whose appropriateness is not obvious except by sensation: for 
<A NAME="294"></A>then the property will not have been correctly stated. For every sensible 
<A NAME="295"></A>attribute, once it is taken beyond the sphere of sensation, becomes uncertain. 
<A NAME="296"></A>For it is not clear whether it still belongs, because it is evidenced only 
<A NAME="297"></A>by sensation. This principle will be true in the case of any attributes 
<A NAME="298"></A>that do not always and necessarily follow. Thus (e.g.) any one who has 
<A NAME="299"></A>stated that it is a property of the sun to be 'the brightest star that 
<A NAME="300"></A>moves over the earth', has used in describing the property an expression 
<A NAME="301"></A>of that kind, viz. 'to move over the earth', which is evidenced by sensation; 
<A NAME="302"></A>and so the sun's property could not have been correctly rendered: for it 
<A NAME="303"></A>will be uncertain, whenever the sun sets, whether it continues to move 
<A NAME="304"></A>over the earth, because sensation then fails us. For constructive purposes, 
<A NAME="305"></A>on the other hand, see whether he has rendered the property of a kind that 
<A NAME="306"></A>is not obvious to sensation, or, if it be sensible, must clearly belong 
<A NAME="307"></A>of necessity: for then the property will in this respect have been correctly 
<A NAME="308"></A>stated. Thus (e.g.) a man who has stated that it is a property of a surface 
<A NAME="309"></A>to be 'the primary thing that is coloured', has introduced amongst the 
<A NAME="310"></A>rest a sensible quality, 'to be coloured', but still a quality such as 
<A NAME="311"></A>manifestly always belongs, and so the property of 'surface' would in this 
<A NAME="312"></A>respect have been correctly rendered.
<A NAME="313"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see whether he has rendered the 
<A NAME="314"></A>definition as a property: for then the property will not have been correctly 
<A NAME="315"></A>stated: for the property of a thing ought not to show its essence. Thus 
<A NAME="316"></A>(e.g.) a man who has said that it is the property of man to be 'a walking, 
<A NAME="317"></A>biped animal' has rendered a property of man so as to signify his essence, 
<A NAME="318"></A>and so the property of man could not have been correctly rendered. For 
<A NAME="319"></A>constructive purposes, on the other hand, see whether the property which 
<A NAME="320"></A>he has rendered forms a predicate convertible with its subject, without, 
<A NAME="321"></A>however, signifying its essence: for then the property will in this respect 
<A NAME="322"></A>have been correctly rendered. Thus (e.g.) he who has stated that it is 
<A NAME="323"></A>a property of man to be a 'naturally civilized animal' has rendered the 
<A NAME="324"></A>property so as to be convertible with its subject, without, however, showing 
<A NAME="325"></A>its essence, and so the property of man' would in this respect have been 
<A NAME="326"></A>correctly rendered.
<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see whether he has rendered the 
<A NAME="328"></A>property without having placed the subject within its essence. For of properties, 
<A NAME="329"></A>as also of definitions, the first term to be rendered should be the genus, 
<A NAME="330"></A>and then the rest of it should be appended immediately afterwards, and 
<A NAME="331"></A>should distinguish its subject from other things. Hence a property which 
<A NAME="332"></A>is not stated in this way could not have been correctly rendered. Thus 
<A NAME="333"></A>(e.g.) a man who has said that it is a property of a living creature to 
<A NAME="334"></A>'have a soul' has not placed 'living creature' within its essence, and 
<A NAME="335"></A>so the property of a living creature could not have been correctly stated. 
<A NAME="336"></A>For constructive purposes, on the other hand, see whether a man first places 
<A NAME="337"></A>within its essence the subject whose property he is rendering, and then 
<A NAME="338"></A>appends the rest: for then the property will in this respect have been 
<A NAME="339"></A>correctly rendered. Thus (e.g.) he who has stated that is a property of 
<A NAME="340"></A>man to be an 'animal capable of receiving knowledge', has rendered the 
<A NAME="341"></A>property after placing the subject within its essence, and so the property 
<A NAME="342"></A>of 'man' would in this respect have been correctly rendered.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="343"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>The inquiry, then, whether the property has been correctly rendered 
<A NAME="345"></A>or no, should be made by these means. The question, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="346"></A>whether what is stated is or is not a property at all, you should examine 
<A NAME="347"></A>from the following points of view. For the commonplace arguments which 
<A NAME="348"></A>establish absolutely that the property is accurately stated will be the 
<A NAME="349"></A>same as those that constitute it a property at all: accordingly they will 
<A NAME="350"></A>be described in the course of them.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>Firstly, then, for destructive purposes, take a look at each subject 
<A NAME="352"></A>of which he has rendered the property, and see (e.g.) if it fails to belong 
<A NAME="353"></A>to any of them at all, or to be true of them in that particular respect, 
<A NAME="354"></A>or to be a property of each of them in respect of that character of which 
<A NAME="355"></A>he has rendered the property: for then what is stated to be a property 
<A NAME="356"></A>will not be a property. Thus, for example, inasmuch as it is not true of 
<A NAME="357"></A>the geometrician that he 'cannot be deceived by an argument' (for a geometrician 
<A NAME="358"></A>is deceived when his figure is misdrawn), it could not be a property of 
<A NAME="359"></A>the man of science that he is not deceived by an argument. For constructive 
<A NAME="360"></A>purposes, on the other hand, see whether the property rendered be true 
<A NAME="361"></A>of every instance, and true in that particular respect: for then what is 
<A NAME="362"></A>stated not to be a property will be a property. Thus, for example, in as 
<A NAME="363"></A>much as the description 'an animal capable of receiving knowledge' is true 
<A NAME="364"></A>of every man, and true of him qua man, it would be a property of man to 
<A NAME="365"></A>be 'an animal capable of receiving knowledge'. commonplace rule means-for 
<A NAME="366"></A>destructive purposes, see if the description fails to be true of that of 
<A NAME="367"></A>which the name is true; and if the name fails to be true of that of which 
<A NAME="368"></A>the description is true: for constructive purposes, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="369"></A>see if the description too is predicated of that of which the name is predicated, 
<A NAME="370"></A>and if the name too is predicated of that of which the description is 
<A NAME="371"></A>predicated.]
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see if the description fails to 
<A NAME="373"></A>apply to that to which the name applies, and if the name fails to apply 
<A NAME="374"></A>to that to which the description applies: for then what is stated to be 
<A NAME="375"></A>a property will not be a property. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as the description 
<A NAME="376"></A>'a living being that partakes of knowledge' is true of God, while 'man' 
<A NAME="377"></A>is not predicated of God, to be a living being that partakes of knowledge' 
<A NAME="378"></A>could not be a property of man. For constructive purposes, on the other 
<A NAME="379"></A>hand, see if the name as well be predicated of that of which the description 
<A NAME="380"></A>is predicated, and if the description as well be predicated of that of 
<A NAME="381"></A>which the name is predicated. For then what is stated not to be a property 
<A NAME="382"></A>will be a property. Thus (e.g.) the predicate 'living creature' is true 
<A NAME="383"></A>of that of which 'having a soul' is true, and 'having a soul' is true of 
<A NAME="384"></A>that of which the predicate 'living creature' is true; and so 'having a 
<A NAME="385"></A>soul would be a property of 'living creature'.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see if he has rendered a subject 
<A NAME="387"></A>as a property of that which is described as 'in the subject': for then 
<A NAME="388"></A>what has been stated to be a property will not be a property. Thus (e.g.) 
<A NAME="389"></A>inasmuch as he who has rendered 'fire' as the property of 'the body with 
<A NAME="390"></A>the most rarefied particles', has rendered the subject as the property 
<A NAME="391"></A>of its predicate, 'fire' could not be a property of 'the body with the 
<A NAME="392"></A>most rarefied particles'. The reason why the subject will not be a property 
<A NAME="393"></A>of that which is found in the subject is this, that then the same thing 
<A NAME="394"></A>will be the property of a number of things that are specifically different. 
<A NAME="395"></A>For the same thing has quite a number of specifically different predicates 
<A NAME="396"></A>that belong to it alone, and the subject will be a property of all of these, 
<A NAME="397"></A>if any one states the property in this way. For constructive purposes, 
<A NAME="398"></A>on the other hand, see if he has rendered what is found in the subject 
<A NAME="399"></A>as a property of the subject: for then what has been stated not to be a 
<A NAME="400"></A>property will be a property, if it be predicated only of the things of 
<A NAME="401"></A>which it has been stated to be the property. Thus (e.g.) he who has said 
<A NAME="402"></A>that it is a property of 'earth' to be 'specifically the heaviest body' 
<A NAME="403"></A>has rendered of the subject as its property something that is said of the 
<A NAME="404"></A>thing in question alone, and is said of it in the manner in which a property 
<A NAME="405"></A>is predicated, and so the property of earth would have been rightly 
<A NAME="406"></A>stated.
<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see if he has rendered the property 
<A NAME="408"></A>as partaken of: for then what is stated to be a property will not be a 
<A NAME="409"></A>property. For an attribute of which the subject partakes is a constituent 
<A NAME="410"></A>part of its essence: and an attribute of that kind would be a differentia 
<A NAME="411"></A>applying to some one species. E.g. inasmuch as he who has said that 'walking 
<A NAME="412"></A>on two feet' is property of man has rendered the property as partaken of, 
<A NAME="413"></A>'walking on two feet' could not be a property of 'man'. For constructive 
<A NAME="414"></A>purposes, on the other hand, see if he has avoided rendering the property 
<A NAME="415"></A>as partaken of, or as showing the essence, though the subject is predicated 
<A NAME="416"></A>convertibly with it: for then what is stated not to be a property will 
<A NAME="417"></A>be a property. Thus (e.g.) he who has stated that to be 'naturally sentient' 
<A NAME="418"></A>is a property of 'animal' has rendered the property neither as partaken 
<A NAME="419"></A>of nor as showing the essence, though the subject is predicated convertibly 
<A NAME="420"></A>with it; and so to be 'naturally sentient' would be a property of 
<A NAME="421"></A>'animal'.
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see if the property cannot possibly 
<A NAME="423"></A>belong simultaneously, but must belong either as posterior or as prior 
<A NAME="424"></A>to the attribute described in the name: for then what is stated to be a 
<A NAME="425"></A>property will not be a property either never, or not always. Thus (e.g.) 
<A NAME="426"></A>inasmuch as it is possible for the attribute 'walking through the market-place' 
<A NAME="427"></A>to belong to an object as prior and as posterior to the attribute 'man', 
<A NAME="428"></A>'walking through the market-place' could not be a property of 'man' either 
<A NAME="429"></A>never, or not always. For constructive purposes, on the other hand, see 
<A NAME="430"></A>if it always and of necessity belongs simultaneously, without being either 
<A NAME="431"></A>a definition or a differentia: for then what is stated not to be a property 
<A NAME="432"></A>will be a property. Thus (e.g.) the attribute 'an animal capable of receiving 
<A NAME="433"></A>knowledge' always and of necessity belongs simultaneously with the attribute 
<A NAME="434"></A>'man', and is neither differentia nor definition of its subject, and so 
<A NAME="435"></A>'an animal capable of receiving knowledge' would be a property of 
<A NAME="436"></A>'man'.
<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see if the same thing fails to 
<A NAME="438"></A>be a property of things that are the same as the subject, so far as they 
<A NAME="439"></A>are the same: for then what is stated to be a property will not be a property. 
<A NAME="440"></A>Thus, for example, inasmuch as it is no property of a 'proper object of 
<A NAME="441"></A>pursuit' to 'appear good to certain persons', it could not be a property 
<A NAME="442"></A>of the 'desirable' either to 'appear good to certain persons': for 'proper 
<A NAME="443"></A>object of pursuit' and 'desirable' mean the same. For constructive purposes, 
<A NAME="444"></A>on the other hand, see if the same thing be a property of something that 
<A NAME="445"></A>is the same as the subject, in so far as it is the same. For then is stated 
<A NAME="446"></A>not to be a property will be a property. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as it is 
<A NAME="447"></A>called a property of a man, in so far as he is a man, 'to have a tripartite 
<A NAME="448"></A>soul', it would also be a property of a mortal, in so far as he is a mortal, 
<A NAME="449"></A>to have a tripartite soul. This commonplace rule is useful also in dealing 
<A NAME="450"></A>with Accident: for the same attributes ought either to belong or not belong 
<A NAME="451"></A>to the same things, in so far as they are the same.
<A NAME="452"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see if the property of things that 
<A NAME="453"></A>are the same in kind as the subject fails to be always the same in kind 
<A NAME="454"></A>as the alleged property: for then neither will what is stated to be the 
<A NAME="455"></A>property of the subject in question. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as a man and 
<A NAME="456"></A>a horse are the same in kind, and it is not always a property of a horse 
<A NAME="457"></A>to stand by its own initiative, it could not be a property of a man to 
<A NAME="458"></A>move by his own initiative; for to stand and to move by his own initiative 
<A NAME="459"></A>are the same in kind, because they belong to each of them in so far as 
<A NAME="460"></A>each is an 'animal'. For constructive purposes, on the other hand, see 
<A NAME="461"></A>if of things that are the same in kind as the subject the property that 
<A NAME="462"></A>is the same as the alleged property is always true: for then what is stated 
<A NAME="463"></A>not to be a property will be a property. Thus (e.g.) since it is a property 
<A NAME="464"></A>of man to be a 'walking biped,' it would also be a property of a bird to 
<A NAME="465"></A>be a 'flying biped': for each of these is the same in kind, in so far as 
<A NAME="466"></A>the one pair have the sameness of species that fall under the same genus, 
<A NAME="467"></A>being under the genus 'animal', while the other pair have that of differentiae 
<A NAME="468"></A>of the genus, viz. of 'animal'. This commonplace rule is deceptive whenever 
<A NAME="469"></A>one of the properties mentioned belongs to some one species only while 
<A NAME="470"></A>the other belongs to many, as does 'walking quadruped'.
<A NAME="471"></A><BR><BR>Inasmuch as 'same' and 'different' are terms used in several senses, 
<A NAME="472"></A>it is a job to render to a sophistical questioner a property that belongs 
<A NAME="473"></A>to one thing and that only. For an attribute that belongs to something 
<A NAME="474"></A>qualified by an accident will also belong to the accident taken along with 
<A NAME="475"></A>the subject which it qualifies; e.g. an attribute that belongs to 'man' 
<A NAME="476"></A>will belong also to 'white man', if there be a white man, and one that 
<A NAME="477"></A>belongs to 'white man' will belong also to 'man'. One might, then, bring 
<A NAME="478"></A>captious criticism against the majority of properties, by representing 
<A NAME="479"></A>the subject as being one thing in itself, and another thing when combined 
<A NAME="480"></A>with its accident, saying, for example, that 'man' is one thing, and white 
<A NAME="481"></A>man' another, and moreover by representing as different a certain state 
<A NAME="482"></A>and what is called after that state. For an attribute that belongs to the 
<A NAME="483"></A>state will belong also to what is called after that state, and one that 
<A NAME="484"></A>belongs to what is called after a state will belong also to the state: 
<A NAME="485"></A>e.g. inasmuch as the condition of the scientist is called after his science, 
<A NAME="486"></A>it could not be a property of 'science' that it is 'incontrovertible by 
<A NAME="487"></A>argument'; for then the scientist also will be incontrovertible by argument. 
<A NAME="488"></A>For constructive purposes, however, you should say that the subject of 
<A NAME="489"></A>an accident is not absolutely different from the accident taken along with 
<A NAME="490"></A>its subject; though it is called 'another' thing because the mode of being 
<A NAME="491"></A>of the two is different: for it is not the same thing for a man to be a 
<A NAME="492"></A>man and for a white man to be a white man. Moreover, you should take a 
<A NAME="493"></A>look along at the inflections, and say that the description of the man 
<A NAME="494"></A>of science is wrong: one should say not 'it' but 'he is incontrovertible 
<A NAME="495"></A>by argument'; while the description of Science is wrong too: one should 
<A NAME="496"></A>say not 'it' but 'she is incontrovertible by argument'. For against an 
<A NAME="497"></A>objector who sticks at nothing the defence should stick at 
<A NAME="498"></A>nothing.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="499"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="500"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see if, while intending to render 
<A NAME="501"></A>an attribute that naturally belongs, he states it in his language in such 
<A NAME="502"></A>a way as to indicate one that invariably belongs: for then it would be 
<A NAME="503"></A>generally agreed that what has been stated to be a property is upset. Thus 
<A NAME="504"></A>(e.g.) the man who has said that 'biped' is a property of man intends to 
<A NAME="505"></A>render the attribute that naturally belongs, but his expression actually 
<A NAME="506"></A>indicates one that invariably belongs: accordingly, 'biped' could not be 
<A NAME="507"></A>a property of man: for not every man is possessed of two feet. For constructive 
<A NAME="508"></A>purposes, on the other hand, see if he intends to render the property that 
<A NAME="509"></A>naturally belongs, and indicates it in that way in his language: for then 
<A NAME="510"></A>the property will not be upset in this respect. Thus (e.g.) he who renders 
<A NAME="511"></A>as a property of 'man' the phrase 'an animal capable of receiving knowledge' 
<A NAME="512"></A>both intends, and by his language indicates, the property that belongs 
<A NAME="513"></A>by nature, and so 'an animal capable of receiving knowledge' would not 
<A NAME="514"></A>be upset or shown in that respect not to be a property of 
<A NAME="515"></A>man.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, as regards all the things that are called as they are 
<A NAME="517"></A>primarily after something else, or primarily in themselves, it is a job 
<A NAME="518"></A>to render the property of such things. For if you render a property as 
<A NAME="519"></A>belonging to the subject that is so called after something else, then it 
<A NAME="520"></A>will be true of its primary subject as well; whereas if you state it of 
<A NAME="521"></A>its primary subject, then it will be predicated also of the thing that 
<A NAME="522"></A>is so called after this other. Thus (e.g.) if any one renders , coloured' 
<A NAME="523"></A>as the property of 'surface', 'coloured' will be true of body as well; 
<A NAME="524"></A>whereas if he render it of 'body', it will be predicated also of 'surface'. 
<A NAME="525"></A>Hence the name as well will not be true of that of which the description 
<A NAME="526"></A>is true.
<A NAME="527"></A><BR><BR>In the case of some properties it mostly happens that some error 
<A NAME="528"></A>is incurred because of a failure to define how as well as to what things 
<A NAME="529"></A>the property is stated to belong. For every one tries to render as the 
<A NAME="530"></A>property of a thing something that belongs to it either naturally, as 'biped' 
<A NAME="531"></A>belongs to 'man', or actually, as 'having four fingers' belongs to a particular 
<A NAME="532"></A>man, or specifically, as 'consisting of most rarefied particles' belongs 
<A NAME="533"></A>to 'fire', or absolutely, as 'life' to 'living being', or one that belongs 
<A NAME="534"></A>to a thing only as called after something else, as 'wisdom' to the 'soul', 
<A NAME="535"></A>or on the other hand primarily, as 'wisdom' to the 'rational faculty', 
<A NAME="536"></A>or because the thing is in a certain state, as 'incontrovertible by argument' 
<A NAME="537"></A>belongs to a 'scientist' (for simply and solely by reason of his being 
<A NAME="538"></A>in a certain state will he be 'incontrovertible by argument'), or because 
<A NAME="539"></A>it is the state possessed by something, as 'incontrovertible by argument' 
<A NAME="540"></A>belongs to 'science', or because it is partaken of, as 'sensation' belongs 
<A NAME="541"></A>to 'animal' (for other things as well have sensation, e.g. man, but they 
<A NAME="542"></A>have it because they already partake of 'animal'), or because it partakes 
<A NAME="543"></A>of something else, as 'life' belongs to a particular kind of 'living being'. 
<A NAME="544"></A>Accordingly he makes a mistake if he has failed to add the word 'naturally', 
<A NAME="545"></A>because what belongs naturally may fail to belong to the thing to which 
<A NAME="546"></A>it naturally belongs, as (e.g.) it belongs to a man to have two feet: so 
<A NAME="547"></A>too he errs if he does not make a definite proviso that he is rendering 
<A NAME="548"></A>what actually belongs, because one day that attribute will not be what 
<A NAME="549"></A>it now is, e.g. the man's possession of four fingers. So he errs if he 
<A NAME="550"></A>has not shown that he states a thing to be such and such primarily, or 
<A NAME="551"></A>that he calls it so after something else, because then its name too will 
<A NAME="552"></A>not be true of that of which the description is true, as is the case with 
<A NAME="553"></A>'coloured', whether rendered as a property of 'surface' or of 'body'. So 
<A NAME="554"></A>he errs if he has not said beforehand that he has rendered a property to 
<A NAME="555"></A>a thing either because that thing possesses a state, or because it is a 
<A NAME="556"></A>state possessed by something; because then it will not be a property. For, 
<A NAME="557"></A>supposing he renders the property to something as being a state possessed, 
<A NAME="558"></A>it will belong to what possesses that state; while supposing he renders 
<A NAME="559"></A>it to what possesses the state, it will belong to the state possessed, 
<A NAME="560"></A>as did 'incontrovertible by argument' when stated as a property of 'science' 
<A NAME="561"></A>or of the 'scientist'. So he errs if he has not indicated beforehand that 
<A NAME="562"></A>the property belongs because the thing partakes of, or is partaken of by, 
<A NAME="563"></A>something; because then the property will belong to certain other things 
<A NAME="564"></A>as well. For if he renders it because its subject is partaken of, it will 
<A NAME="565"></A>belong to the things which partake of it; whereas if he renders it because 
<A NAME="566"></A>its subject partakes of something else, it will belong to the things partaken 
<A NAME="567"></A>of, as (e.g.) if he were to state 'life' to be a property of a 'particular 
<A NAME="568"></A>kind of living being', or just of 'living being. So he errs if he has not 
<A NAME="569"></A>expressly distinguished the property that belongs specifically, because 
<A NAME="570"></A>then it will belong only to one of the things that fall under the term 
<A NAME="571"></A>of which he states the property: for the superlative belongs only to one 
<A NAME="572"></A>of them, e.g. 'lightest' as applied to 'fire'. Sometimes, too, a man may 
<A NAME="573"></A>even add the word 'specifically', and still make a mistake. For the things 
<A NAME="574"></A>in question should all be of one species, whenever the word 'specifically' 
<A NAME="575"></A>is added: and in some cases this does not occur, as it does not, in fact, 
<A NAME="576"></A>in the case of fire. For fire is not all of one species; for live coals 
<A NAME="577"></A>and flame and light are each of them 'fire', but are of different species. 
<A NAME="578"></A>The reason why, whenever 'specifically' is added, there should not be any 
<A NAME="579"></A>species other than the one mentioned, is this, that if there be, then the 
<A NAME="580"></A>property in question will belong to some of them in a greater and to others 
<A NAME="581"></A>in a less degree, as happens with 'consisting of most rarefied particles' 
<A NAME="582"></A>in the case of fire: for 'light' consists of more rarefied particles than 
<A NAME="583"></A>live coals and flame. And this should not happen unless the name too be 
<A NAME="584"></A>predicated in a greater degree of that of which the description is truer; 
<A NAME="585"></A>otherwise the rule that where the description is truer the name too should 
<A NAME="586"></A>be truer is not fulfilled. Moreover, in addition to this, the same attribute 
<A NAME="587"></A>will be the property both of the term which has it absolutely and of that 
<A NAME="588"></A>element therein which has it in the highest degree, as is the condition 
<A NAME="589"></A>of the property 'consisting of most rarefied particles' in the case of 
<A NAME="590"></A>'fire': for this same attribute will be the property of 'light' as well: 
<A NAME="591"></A>for it is 'light' that 'consists of the most rarefied particles'. If, then, 
<A NAME="592"></A>any one else renders a property in this way one should attack it; for oneself, 
<A NAME="593"></A>one should not give occasion for this objection, but should define in what 
<A NAME="594"></A>manner one states the property at the actual time of making the 
<A NAME="595"></A>statement.
<A NAME="596"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see if he has stated a thing as 
<A NAME="597"></A>a property of itself: for then what has been stated to be a property will 
<A NAME="598"></A>not be a property. For a thing itself always shows its own essence, and 
<A NAME="599"></A>what shows the essence is not a property but a definition. Thus (e.g.) 
<A NAME="600"></A>he who has said that 'becoming' is a property of 'beautiful' has rendered 
<A NAME="601"></A>the term as a property of itself (for 'beautiful' and 'becoming' are the 
<A NAME="602"></A>same); and so 'becoming' could not be a property of 'beautiful'. For constructive 
<A NAME="603"></A>purposes, on the other hand, see if he has avoided rendering a thing as 
<A NAME="604"></A>a property of itself, but has yet stated a convertible predicate: for then 
<A NAME="605"></A>what is stated not to be a property will be a property. Thus he who has 
<A NAME="606"></A>stated 'animate substance' as a property of 'living-creature' has not stated 
<A NAME="607"></A>'living-creature' as a property of itself, but has rendered a convertible 
<A NAME="608"></A>predicate, so that 'animate substance' would be a property of 
<A NAME="609"></A>'living-creature'.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>Next, in the case of things consisting of like parts, you should 
<A NAME="611"></A>look and see, for destructive purposes, if the property of the whole be 
<A NAME="612"></A>not true of the part, or if that of the part be not predicated of the whole: 
<A NAME="613"></A>for then what has been stated to be the property will not be a property. 
<A NAME="614"></A>In some cases it happens that this is so: for sometimes in rendering a 
<A NAME="615"></A>property in the case of things that consist of like parts a man may have 
<A NAME="616"></A>his eye on the whole, while sometimes he may address himself to what is 
<A NAME="617"></A>predicated of the part: and then in neither case will it have been rightly 
<A NAME="618"></A>rendered. Take an instance referring to the whole: the man who has said 
<A NAME="619"></A>that it is a property of the 'sea' to be 'the largest volume of salt water', 
<A NAME="620"></A>has stated the property of something that consists of like parts, but has 
<A NAME="621"></A>rendered an attribute of such a kind as is not true of the part (for a 
<A NAME="622"></A>particular sea is not 'the largest volume of salt water'); and so the largest 
<A NAME="623"></A>volume of salt water' could not be a property of the 'sea'. Now take one 
<A NAME="624"></A>referring to the part: the man who has stated that it is a property of 
<A NAME="625"></A>'air' to be 'breathable' has stated the property of something that consists 
<A NAME="626"></A>of like parts, but he has stated an attribute such as, though true of some 
<A NAME="627"></A>air, is still not predicable of the whole (for the whole of the air is 
<A NAME="628"></A>not breathable); and so 'breathable' could not be a property of 'air'. 
<A NAME="629"></A>For constructive purposes, on the other hand, see whether, while it is 
<A NAME="630"></A>true of each of the things with similar parts, it is on the other hand 
<A NAME="631"></A>a property of them taken as a collective whole: for then what has been 
<A NAME="632"></A>stated not to be a property will be a property. Thus (e.g.) while it is 
<A NAME="633"></A>true of earth everywhere that it naturally falls downwards, it is a property 
<A NAME="634"></A>of the various particular pieces of earth taken as 'the Earth', so that 
<A NAME="635"></A>it would be a property of 'earth' 'naturally to fall 
<A NAME="636"></A>downwards'.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="637"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="638"></A><BR><BR>Next, look from the point of view of the respective opposites, 
<A NAME="639"></A>and first (a) from that of the contraries, and see, for destructive purposes, 
<A NAME="640"></A>if the contrary of the term rendered fails to be a property of the contrary 
<A NAME="641"></A>subject. For then neither will the contrary of the first be a property 
<A NAME="642"></A>of the contrary of the second. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as injustice is contrary 
<A NAME="643"></A>to justice, and the lowest evil to the highest good, but 'to be the highest 
<A NAME="644"></A>good' is not a property of 'justice', therefore 'to be the lowest evil' 
<A NAME="645"></A>could not be a property of 'injustice'. For constructive purposes, on the 
<A NAME="646"></A>other hand, see if the contrary is the property of the contrary: for then 
<A NAME="647"></A>also the contrary of the first will be the property of the contrary of 
<A NAME="648"></A>the second. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as evil is contrary to good, and objectionable 
<A NAME="649"></A>to desirable, and 'desirable' is a property of 'good', 'objectionable' 
<A NAME="650"></A>would be a property of 'evil'.
<A NAME="651"></A><BR><BR>Secondly (h) look from the point of view of relative opposites 
<A NAME="652"></A>and see, for destructive purposes, if the correlative of the term rendered 
<A NAME="653"></A>fails to be a property of the correlative of the subject: for then neither 
<A NAME="654"></A>will the correlative of the first be a property of the correlative of the 
<A NAME="655"></A>second. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as 'double' is relative to 'half', and 'in 
<A NAME="656"></A>excess' to 'exceeded', while 'in excess' is not a property of 'double', 
<A NAME="657"></A>exceeded' could not be a property of 'half'. For constructive purposes, 
<A NAME="658"></A>on the other hand, see if the correlative of the alleged property is a 
<A NAME="659"></A>property of the subject's correlative: for then also the correlative of 
<A NAME="660"></A>the first will be a property of the correlative of the second: e.g. inasmuch 
<A NAME="661"></A>as 'double' is relative to 'half', and the proportion 1:2 is relative to 
<A NAME="662"></A>the proportion 2:1, while it is a property of 'double' to be 'in the proportion 
<A NAME="663"></A>of 2 to 1', it would be a property of 'half' to be 'in the proportion of 
<A NAME="664"></A>1 to 2'.
<A NAME="665"></A><BR><BR>Thirdly (c) for destructive purposes, see if an attribute described 
<A NAME="666"></A>in terms of a state (X) fails to be a property of the given state (Y): 
<A NAME="667"></A>for then neither will the attribute described in terms of the privation 
<A NAME="668"></A>(of X) be a property of the privation (of Y). Also if, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="669"></A>an attribute described in terms of the privation (of X) be not a property 
<A NAME="670"></A>of the given privation (of Y), neither will the attribute described in 
<A NAME="671"></A>terms of the state (X) be a property of the state (Y). Thus, for example, 
<A NAME="672"></A>inasmuch as it is not predicated as a property of 'deafness' to be a 'lack 
<A NAME="673"></A>of sensation', neither could it be a property of 'hearing' to be a 'sensation'. 
<A NAME="674"></A>For constructive purposes, on the other hand, see if an attribute described 
<A NAME="675"></A>in terms of a state (X) is a property of the given state (Y): for then 
<A NAME="676"></A>also the attribute that is described in terms of the privation (of X) will 
<A NAME="677"></A>be a property of the privation (of Y). Also, if an attribute described 
<A NAME="678"></A>in terms of a privation (of X) be a property of the privation (of Y), then 
<A NAME="679"></A>also the attribute that is described in terms of the state (X) will be 
<A NAME="680"></A>a property of the state (Y). Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as 'to see' is a property 
<A NAME="681"></A>of 'sight', inasmuch as we have sight, 'failure to see' would be a property 
<A NAME="682"></A>of 'blindness', inasmuch as we have not got the sight we should naturally 
<A NAME="683"></A>have.
<A NAME="684"></A><BR><BR>Next, look from the point of view of positive and negative terms; 
<A NAME="685"></A>and first (a) from the point of view of the predicates taken by themselves. 
<A NAME="686"></A>This common-place rule is useful only for a destructive purpose. Thus (e.g.) 
<A NAME="687"></A>see if the positive term or the attribute described in terms of it is a 
<A NAME="688"></A>property of the subject: for then the negative term or the attribute described 
<A NAME="689"></A>in terms of it will not be a property of the subject. Also if, on the other 
<A NAME="690"></A>hand, the negative term or the attribute described in terms of it is a 
<A NAME="691"></A>property of the subject, then the positive term or the attribute described 
<A NAME="692"></A>in terms of it will not be a property of the subject: e.g. inasmuch as 
<A NAME="693"></A>'animate' is a property of 'living creature', 'inanimate' could not be 
<A NAME="694"></A>a property of 'living creature'.
<A NAME="695"></A><BR><BR>Secondly (b) look from the point of view of the predicates, positive 
<A NAME="696"></A>or negative, and their respective subjects; and see, for destructive purposes, 
<A NAME="697"></A>if the positive term falls to be a property of the positive subject: for 
<A NAME="698"></A>then neither will the negative term be a property of the negative subject. 
<A NAME="699"></A>Also, if the negative term fails to be a property of the negative subject, 
<A NAME="700"></A>neither will the positive term be a property of the positive subject. Thus 
<A NAME="701"></A>(e.g.) inasmuch as 'animal' is not a property of 'man', neither could 'not-animal' 
<A NAME="702"></A>be a property of 'not-man'. Also if 'not-animal' seems not to be a property 
<A NAME="703"></A>of 'not-man', neither will 'animal' be a property of 'man'. For constructive 
<A NAME="704"></A>purposes, on the other hand, see if the positive term is a property of 
<A NAME="705"></A>the positive subject: for then the negative term will be a property of 
<A NAME="706"></A>the negative subject as well. Also if the negative term be a property of 
<A NAME="707"></A>the negative subject, the positive will be a property of the positive as 
<A NAME="708"></A>well. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as it is a property of 'not-living being' 'not 
<A NAME="709"></A>to live', it would be a property of 'living being' 'to live': also if it 
<A NAME="710"></A>seems to be a property of 'living being' 'to live', it will also seem to 
<A NAME="711"></A>be a property of 'not-living being' 'not to live'.
<A NAME="712"></A><BR><BR>Thirdly (c) look from the point of view of the subjects taken by 
<A NAME="713"></A>themselves, and see, for destructive purposes, if the property rendered 
<A NAME="714"></A>is a property of the positive subject: for then the same term will not 
<A NAME="715"></A>be a property of the negative subject as well. Also, if the term rendered 
<A NAME="716"></A>be a property of the negative subject, it will not be a property of the 
<A NAME="717"></A>positive. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as 'animate' is a property of 'living creature', 
<A NAME="718"></A>'animate' could not be a property of 'not-living creature'. For constructive 
<A NAME="719"></A>purposes, on the other hand, if the term rendered fails to be a property 
<A NAME="720"></A>of the affirmative subject it would be a property of the negative. This 
<A NAME="721"></A>commonplace rule is, however, deceptive: for a positive term is not a property 
<A NAME="722"></A>of a negative, or a negative of a positive. For a positive term does not 
<A NAME="723"></A>belong at all to a negative, while a negative term, though it belongs to 
<A NAME="724"></A>a positive, does not belong as a property.
<A NAME="725"></A><BR><BR>Next, look from the point of view of the coordinate members of 
<A NAME="726"></A>a division, and see, for destructive purposes, if none of the co-ordinate 
<A NAME="727"></A>members (parallel with the property rendered) be a property of any of the 
<A NAME="728"></A>remaining set of co-ordinate members (parallel with the subject): for then 
<A NAME="729"></A>neither will the term stated be a property of that of which it is stated 
<A NAME="730"></A>to be a property. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as 'sensible living being' is not 
<A NAME="731"></A>a property of any of the other living beings, 'intelligible living being' 
<A NAME="732"></A>could not be a property of God. For constructive purposes, on the other 
<A NAME="733"></A>hand, see if some one or other of the remaining co-ordinate members (parallel 
<A NAME="734"></A>with the property rendered) be a property of each of these co-ordinate 
<A NAME="735"></A>members (parallel with the subject): for then the remaining one too will 
<A NAME="736"></A>be a property of that of which it has been stated not to be a property. 
<A NAME="737"></A>Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as it is a property of 'wisdom' to be essentially 
<A NAME="738"></A>'the natural virtue of the rational faculty', then, taking each of the 
<A NAME="739"></A>other virtues as well in this way, it would be a property of 'temperance' 
<A NAME="740"></A>to be essentially 'the natural virtue of the faculty of 
<A NAME="741"></A>desire'.
<A NAME="742"></A><BR><BR>Next, look from the point of view of the inflexions, and see, for 
<A NAME="743"></A>destructive purposes, if the inflexion of the property rendered fails to 
<A NAME="744"></A>be a property of the inflexion of the subject: for then neither will the 
<A NAME="745"></A>other inflexion be a property of the other inflexion. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch 
<A NAME="746"></A>as 'beautifully' is not a property of 'justly', neither could 'beautiful' 
<A NAME="747"></A>be a property of 'just'. For constructive purposes, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="748"></A>see if the inflexion of the property rendered is a property of the inflexion 
<A NAME="749"></A>of the subject: for then also the other inflexion will be a property of 
<A NAME="750"></A>the other inflexion. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as 'walking biped' is a property 
<A NAME="751"></A>of man, it would also be any one's property 'as a man' to be described 
<A NAME="752"></A>'as a walking biped'. Not only in the case of the actual term mentioned 
<A NAME="753"></A>should one look at the inflexions, but also in the case of its opposites, 
<A NAME="754"></A>just as has been laid down in the case of the former commonplace rules 
<A NAME="755"></A>as well.' Thus, for destructive purposes, see if the inflexion of the opposite 
<A NAME="756"></A>of the property rendered fails to be the property of the inflexion of the 
<A NAME="757"></A>opposite of the subject: for then neither will the inflexion of the other 
<A NAME="758"></A>opposite be a property of the inflexion of the other opposite. Thus (e.g.) 
<A NAME="759"></A>inasmuch as 'well' is not a property of 'justly', neither could 'badly' 
<A NAME="760"></A>be a property of 'unjustly'. For constructive purposes, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="761"></A>see if the inflexion of the opposite of the property originally suggested 
<A NAME="762"></A>is a property of the inflexion of the opposite of the original subject: 
<A NAME="763"></A>for then also the inflexion of the other opposite will be a property of 
<A NAME="764"></A>the inflexion of the other opposite. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as 'best' is 
<A NAME="765"></A>a property of 'the good', 'worst' also will be a property of 'the 
<A NAME="766"></A>evil'.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="767"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="768"></A><BR><BR>Next, look from the point of view of things that are in a like 
<A NAME="769"></A>relation, and see, for destructive purposes, if what is in a relation like 
<A NAME="770"></A>that of the property rendered fails to be a property of what is in a relation 
<A NAME="771"></A>like that of the subject: for then neither will what is in a relation like 
<A NAME="772"></A>that of the first be a property of what is in a relation like that of the 
<A NAME="773"></A>second. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as the relation of the builder towards the 
<A NAME="774"></A>production of a house is like that of the doctor towards the production 
<A NAME="775"></A>of health, and it is not a property of a doctor to produce health, it could 
<A NAME="776"></A>not be a property of a builder to produce a house. For constructive purposes, 
<A NAME="777"></A>on the other hand, see if what is in a relation like that of the property 
<A NAME="778"></A>rendered is a property of what is in a relation like that of the subject: 
<A NAME="779"></A>for then also what is in a relation like that of the first will be a property 
<A NAME="780"></A>of what is in a relation like that of the second. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch 
<A NAME="781"></A>as the relation of a doctor towards the possession of ability to produce 
<A NAME="782"></A>health is like that of a trainer towards the possession of ability to produce 
<A NAME="783"></A>vigour, and it is a property of a trainer to possess the ability to produce 
<A NAME="784"></A>vigour, it would be a property of a doctor to possess the ability to produce 
<A NAME="785"></A>health.
<A NAME="786"></A><BR><BR>Next look from the point of view of things that are identically 
<A NAME="787"></A>related, and see, for destructive purposes, if the predicate that is identically 
<A NAME="788"></A>related towards two subjects fails to be a property of the subject which 
<A NAME="789"></A>is identically related to it as the subject in question; for then neither 
<A NAME="790"></A>will the predicate that is identically related to both subjects be a property 
<A NAME="791"></A>of the subject which is identically related to it as the first. If, on 
<A NAME="792"></A>the other hand, the predicate which is identically related to two subjects 
<A NAME="793"></A>is the property of the subject which is identically related to it as the 
<A NAME="794"></A>subject in question, then it will not be a property of that of which it 
<A NAME="795"></A>has been stated to be a property. (e.g.) inasmuch as prudence is identically 
<A NAME="796"></A>related to both the noble and the base, since it is knowledge of each of 
<A NAME="797"></A>them, and it is not a property of prudence to be knowledge of the noble, 
<A NAME="798"></A>it could not be a property of prudence to be knowledge of the base. If, 
<A NAME="799"></A>on the other hand, it is a property of prudence to be the knowledge of 
<A NAME="800"></A>the noble, it could not be a property of it to be the knowledge of the 
<A NAME="801"></A>base.] For it is impossible for the same thing to be a property of more 
<A NAME="802"></A>than one subject. For constructive purposes, on the other hand, this commonplace 
<A NAME="803"></A>rule is of no use: for what is 'identically related' is a single predicate 
<A NAME="804"></A>in process of comparison with more than one subject.
<A NAME="805"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see if the predicate qualified 
<A NAME="806"></A>by the verb 'to be' fails to be a property of the subject qualified by 
<A NAME="807"></A>the verb 'to be': for then neither will the destruction of the one be a 
<A NAME="808"></A>property of the other qualified by the verb 'to be destroyed', nor will 
<A NAME="809"></A>the 'becoming'the one be a property of the other qualified by the verb 
<A NAME="810"></A>'to become'. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as it is not a property of 'man' to be 
<A NAME="811"></A>an animal, neither could it be a property of becoming a man to become an 
<A NAME="812"></A>animal; nor could the destruction of an animal be a property of the destruction 
<A NAME="813"></A>of a man. In the same way one should derive arguments also from 'becoming' 
<A NAME="814"></A>to 'being' and 'being destroyed', and from 'being destroyed' to 'being' 
<A NAME="815"></A>and to 'becoming' exactly as they have just been given from 'being' to 
<A NAME="816"></A>'becoming' and 'being destroyed'. For constructive purposes, on the other 
<A NAME="817"></A>hand, see if the subject set down as qualified by the verb 'to be' has 
<A NAME="818"></A>the predicate set down as so qualified, as its property: for then also 
<A NAME="819"></A>the subject qualified by the very 'to become' will have the predicate qualified 
<A NAME="820"></A>by 'to become' as its property, and the subject qualified by the verb to 
<A NAME="821"></A>be destroyed' will have as its property the predicate rendered with this 
<A NAME="822"></A>qualification. Thus, for example, inasmuch as it is a property of man to 
<A NAME="823"></A>be a mortal, it would be a property of becoming a man to become a mortal, 
<A NAME="824"></A>and the destruction of a mortal would be a property of the destruction 
<A NAME="825"></A>of a man. In the same way one should derive arguments also from 'becoming' 
<A NAME="826"></A>and 'being destroyed' both to 'being' and to the conclusions that follow 
<A NAME="827"></A>from them, exactly as was directed also for the purpose of 
<A NAME="828"></A>destruction.
<A NAME="829"></A><BR><BR>Next take a look at the 'idea' of the subject stated, and see, 
<A NAME="830"></A>for destructive purposes, if the suggested property fails to belong to 
<A NAME="831"></A>the 'idea' in question, or fails to belong to it in virtue of that character 
<A NAME="832"></A>which causes it to bear the description of which the property was rendered: 
<A NAME="833"></A>for then what has been stated to be a property will not be a property. 
<A NAME="834"></A>Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as 'being motionless' does not belong to 'man-himself' 
<A NAME="835"></A>qua 'man', but qua 'idea', it could not be a property of 'man' to be motionless. 
<A NAME="836"></A>For constructive purposes, on the other hand, see if the property in question 
<A NAME="837"></A>belongs to the idea, and belongs to it in that respect in virtue of which 
<A NAME="838"></A>there is predicated of it that character of which the predicate in question 
<A NAME="839"></A>has been stated not to be a property: for then what has been stated not 
<A NAME="840"></A>to be a property will be a property. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as it belongs 
<A NAME="841"></A>to 'living-creature-itself' to be compounded of soul and body, and further 
<A NAME="842"></A>this belongs to it qua 'living-creature', it would be a property of 'living-creature' 
<A NAME="843"></A>to be compounded of soul and body.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="844"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="845"></A><BR><BR>Next look from the point of view of greater and less degrees, and 
<A NAME="846"></A>first (a) for destructive purposes, see if what is more-P fails to be a 
<A NAME="847"></A>property of what is more-S: for then neither will what is less-P be a property 
<A NAME="848"></A>of what is less-S, nor least-P of least-S, nor most-P of most-S, nor P 
<A NAME="849"></A>simply of S simply. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as being more highly coloured 
<A NAME="850"></A>is not a property of what is more a body, neither could being less highly 
<A NAME="851"></A>coloured be a property of what is less a body, nor being coloured be a 
<A NAME="852"></A>property of body at all. For constructive purposes, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="853"></A>see if what is more-P is a property of what is more-S: for then also what 
<A NAME="854"></A>is less-P will be a property of what is less S, and least-P of least-S, 
<A NAME="855"></A>and most-P of most-S, and P simply of S simply. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as 
<A NAME="856"></A>a higher degree of sensation is a property of a higher degree of life, 
<A NAME="857"></A>a lower degree of sensation also would be a property of a lower degree 
<A NAME="858"></A>of life, and the highest of the highest and the lowest of the lowest degree, 
<A NAME="859"></A>and sensation simply of life simply.
<A NAME="860"></A><BR><BR>Also you should look at the argument from a simple predication 
<A NAME="861"></A>to the same qualified types of predication, and see, for destructive purposes, 
<A NAME="862"></A>if P simply fails to be a property of S simply; for then neither will more-P 
<A NAME="863"></A>be a property of more-S, nor less-P of less-S, nor most-P of most-S, nor 
<A NAME="864"></A>least-P of least-S. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as 'virtuous' is not a property 
<A NAME="865"></A>of 'man', neither could 'more virtuous' be a property of what is 'more 
<A NAME="866"></A>human'. For constructive purposes, on the other hand, see if P simply is 
<A NAME="867"></A>a property of S simply: for then more P also will be a property of more-S, 
<A NAME="868"></A>and less-P of less-S, and least-P of least-S, and most-P of most-S. Thus 
<A NAME="869"></A>(e.g.) a tendency to move upwards by nature is a property of fire, and 
<A NAME="870"></A>so also a greater tendency to move upwards by nature would be a property 
<A NAME="871"></A>of what is more fiery. In the same way too one should look at all these 
<A NAME="872"></A>matters from the point of view of the others as well.
<A NAME="873"></A><BR><BR>Secondly (b) for destructive purposes, see if the more likely property 
<A NAME="874"></A>fails to be a property of the more likely subject: for then neither will 
<A NAME="875"></A>the less likely property be a property of the less likely subject. Thus 
<A NAME="876"></A>(e.g.) inasmuch as 'perceiving' is more likely to be a property of 'animal' 
<A NAME="877"></A>than 'knowing' of 'man', and 'perceiving' is not a property of 'animal', 
<A NAME="878"></A>'knowing' could not be a property of 'man'. For constructive purposes, 
<A NAME="879"></A>on the other hand, see if the less likely property is a property of the 
<A NAME="880"></A>less likely subject; for then too the more likely property will be a property 
<A NAME="881"></A>of the more likely subject. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as 'to be naturally civilized' 
<A NAME="882"></A>is less likely to be a property of man than 'to live' of an animal, and 
<A NAME="883"></A>it is a property of man to be naturally civilized, it would be a property 
<A NAME="884"></A>of animal to live.
<A NAME="885"></A><BR><BR>Thirdly (c) for destructive purposes, see if the predicate fails 
<A NAME="886"></A>to be a property of that of which it is more likely to be a property: for 
<A NAME="887"></A>then neither will it be a property of that of which it is less likely to 
<A NAME="888"></A>be a property: while if it is a property of the former, it will not be 
<A NAME="889"></A>a property of the latter. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as 'to be coloured' is more 
<A NAME="890"></A>likely to be a property of a 'surface' than of a 'body', and it is not 
<A NAME="891"></A>a property of a surface, 'to be coloured' could not be a property of 'body'; 
<A NAME="892"></A>while if it is a property of a 'surface', it could not be a property of 
<A NAME="893"></A>a 'body'. For constructive purposes, on the other hand, this commonplace 
<A NAME="894"></A>rule is not of any use: for it is impossible for the same thing to be a 
<A NAME="895"></A>property of more than one thing.
<A NAME="896"></A><BR><BR>Fourthly (d) for destructive purposes, see if what is more likely 
<A NAME="897"></A>to be a property of a given subject fails to be its property: for then 
<A NAME="898"></A>neither will what is less likely to be a property of it be its property. 
<A NAME="899"></A>Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as 'sensible' is more likely than 'divisible' to be 
<A NAME="900"></A>a property of 'animal', and 'sensible' is not a property of animal, 'divisible' 
<A NAME="901"></A>could not be a property of animal. For constructive purposes, on the other 
<A NAME="902"></A>hand, see if what is less likely to be a property of it is a property; 
<A NAME="903"></A>for then what is more likely to be a property of it will be a property 
<A NAME="904"></A>as well. Thus, for example, inasmuch as 'sensation' is less likely to be 
<A NAME="905"></A>a property of 'animal' than life', and 'sensation' is a property of animal, 
<A NAME="906"></A>'life' would be a property of animal.
<A NAME="907"></A><BR><BR>Next, look from the point of view of the attributes that belong 
<A NAME="908"></A>in a like manner, and first (a) for destructive purposes, see if what is 
<A NAME="909"></A>as much a property fails to be a property of that of which it is as much 
<A NAME="910"></A>a property: for then neither will that which is as much a property as it 
<A NAME="911"></A>be a property of that of which it is as much a property. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch 
<A NAME="912"></A>as 'desiring' is as much a property of the faculty of desire as reasoning' 
<A NAME="913"></A>is a property of the faculty of reason, and desiring is not a property 
<A NAME="914"></A>of the faculty of desire, reasoning could not be a property of the faculty 
<A NAME="915"></A>of reason. For constructive purposes, on the other hand, see if what is 
<A NAME="916"></A>as much a property is a property of that of which it is as much a property: 
<A NAME="917"></A>for then also what is as much a property as it will be a property of that 
<A NAME="918"></A>of which it is as much a property. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as it is as much 
<A NAME="919"></A>a property of 'the faculty of reason' to be 'the primary seat of wisdom' 
<A NAME="920"></A>as it is of 'the faculty of desire' to be 'the primary seat of temperance', 
<A NAME="921"></A>and it is a property of the faculty of reason to be the primary seat of 
<A NAME="922"></A>wisdom, it would be a property of the faculty of desire to be the primary 
<A NAME="923"></A>seat of temperance.
<A NAME="924"></A><BR><BR>Secondly (b) for destructive purposes, see if what is as much a 
<A NAME="925"></A>property of anything fails to be a property of it: for then neither will 
<A NAME="926"></A>what is as much a property be a property of it. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as 
<A NAME="927"></A>'seeing' is as much a property of man as 'hearing', and 'seeing' is not 
<A NAME="928"></A>a property of man, 'hearing' could not be a property of man. For constructive 
<A NAME="929"></A>purposes, on the other hand, see if what is as much a property of it is 
<A NAME="930"></A>its property: for then what is as much a property of it as the former will 
<A NAME="931"></A>be its property as well. Thus (e.g.) it is as much a property of the soul 
<A NAME="932"></A>to be the primary possessor of a part that desires as of a part that reasons, 
<A NAME="933"></A>and it is a property of the soul to be the primary possessor of a part 
<A NAME="934"></A>that desires, and so it be a property of the soul to be the primary possessor 
<A NAME="935"></A>of a part that reasons.
<A NAME="936"></A><BR><BR>Thirdly (c) for destructive purposes, see if it fails to be a property 
<A NAME="937"></A>of that of which it is as much a property: for then neither will it be 
<A NAME="938"></A>a property of that of which it is as much a property as of the former, 
<A NAME="939"></A>while if it be a property of the former, it will not be a property of the 
<A NAME="940"></A>other. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as 'to burn' is as much a property of 'flame' 
<A NAME="941"></A>as of 'live coals', and 'to burn' is not a property of flame, 'to burn' 
<A NAME="942"></A>could not be a property of live coals: while if it is a property of flame, 
<A NAME="943"></A>it could not be a property of live coals. For constructive purposes, on 
<A NAME="944"></A>the other hand, this commonplace rule is of no use.
<A NAME="945"></A><BR><BR>The rule based on things that are in a like relation' differs from 
<A NAME="946"></A>the rule based on attributes that belong in a like manner,' because the 
<A NAME="947"></A>former point is secured by analogy, not from reflection on the belonging 
<A NAME="948"></A>of any attribute, while the latter is judged by a comparison based on the 
<A NAME="949"></A>fact that an attribute belongs.
<A NAME="950"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see if in rendering the property 
<A NAME="951"></A>potentially, he has also through that potentiality rendered the property 
<A NAME="952"></A>relatively to something that does not exist, when the potentiality in question 
<A NAME="953"></A>cannot belong to what does not exist: for then what is stated to be a property 
<A NAME="954"></A>will not be a property. Thus (e.g.) he who has said that 'breathable' is 
<A NAME="955"></A>a property of 'air' has, on the one hand, rendered the property potentially 
<A NAME="956"></A>(for that is 'breathable' which is such as can be breathed), and on the 
<A NAME="957"></A>other hand has also rendered the property relatively to what does not exist:-for 
<A NAME="958"></A>while air may exist, even though there exist no animal so constituted as 
<A NAME="959"></A>to breathe the air, it is not possible to breathe it if no animal exist: 
<A NAME="960"></A>so that it will not, either, be a property of air to be such as can be 
<A NAME="961"></A>breathed at a time when there exists no animal such as to breathe it and 
<A NAME="962"></A>so it follows that 'breathable' could not be a property of 
<A NAME="963"></A>air.
<A NAME="964"></A><BR><BR>For constructive purposes, see if in rendering the property potentially 
<A NAME="965"></A>he renders the property either relatively to something that exists, or 
<A NAME="966"></A>to something that does not exist, when the potentiality in question can 
<A NAME="967"></A>belong to what does not exist: for then what has been stated not to be 
<A NAME="968"></A>a property will be a property. Thus e.g.) he who renders it as a property 
<A NAME="969"></A>of 'being' to be 'capable of being acted upon or of acting', in rendering 
<A NAME="970"></A>the property potentially, has rendered the property relatively to something 
<A NAME="971"></A>that exists: for when 'being' exists, it will also be capable of being 
<A NAME="972"></A>acted upon or of acting in a certain way: so that to be 'capable of being 
<A NAME="973"></A>acted upon or of acting' would be a property of 'being'.
<A NAME="974"></A><BR><BR>Next, for destructive purposes, see if he has stated the property 
<A NAME="975"></A>in the superlative: for then what has been stated to be a property will 
<A NAME="976"></A>not be a property. For people who render the property in that way find 
<A NAME="977"></A>that of the object of which the description is true, the name is not true 
<A NAME="978"></A>as well: for though the object perish the description will continue in 
<A NAME="979"></A>being none the less; for it belongs most nearly to something that is in 
<A NAME="980"></A>being. An example would be supposing any one were to render 'the lightest 
<A NAME="981"></A>body' as a property of 'fire': for, though fire perish, there eh re will 
<A NAME="982"></A>still be some form of body that is the lightest, so that 'the lightest 
<A NAME="983"></A>body' could not be a property of fire. For constructive purposes, on the 
<A NAME="984"></A>other hand, see if he has avoided rendering the property in the superlative: 
<A NAME="985"></A>for then the property will in this respect have been property of man has 
<A NAME="986"></A>not rendered the property correctly stated. Thus (e.g.) inasmuch as he 
<A NAME="987"></A>in the superlative, the property would in who states 'a naturally civilized 
<A NAME="988"></A>animal' as a this respect have been correctly stated.
