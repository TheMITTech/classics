<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>We have now discussed the physical characteristics of animals and their 
<A NAME="12"></A>methods of generation. Their habits and their modes of living vary according 
<A NAME="13"></A>to their character and their food.
<A NAME="14"></A><BR><BR>In the great majority of animals there are traces of psychical 
<A NAME="15"></A>qualities or attitudes, which qualities are more markedly differentiated 
<A NAME="16"></A>in the case of human beings. For just as we pointed out resemblances in 
<A NAME="17"></A>the physical organs, so in a number of animals we observe gentleness or 
<A NAME="18"></A>fierceness, mildness or cross temper, courage, or timidity, fear or confidence, 
<A NAME="19"></A>high spirit or low cunning, and, with regard to intelligence, something 
<A NAME="20"></A>equivalent to sagacity. Some of these qualities in man, as compared with 
<A NAME="21"></A>the corresponding qualities in animals, differ only quantitatively: that 
<A NAME="22"></A>is to say, a man has more or less of this quality, and an animal has more 
<A NAME="23"></A>or less of some other; other qualities in man are represented by analogous 
<A NAME="24"></A>and not identical qualities: for instance, just as in man we find knowledge, 
<A NAME="25"></A>wisdom, and sagacity, so in certain animals there exists some other natural 
<A NAME="26"></A>potentiality akin to these. The truth of this statement will be the more 
<A NAME="27"></A>clearly apprehended if we have regard to the phenomena of childhood: for 
<A NAME="28"></A>in children may be observed the traces and seeds of what will one day be 
<A NAME="29"></A>settled psychological habits, though psychologically a child hardly differs 
<A NAME="30"></A>for the time being from an animal; so that one is quite justified in saying 
<A NAME="31"></A>that, as regards man and animals, certain psychical qualities are identical 
<A NAME="32"></A>with one another, whilst others resemble, and others are analogous to, 
<A NAME="33"></A>each other.
<A NAME="34"></A><BR><BR>Nature proceeds little by little from things lifeless to animal 
<A NAME="35"></A>life in such a way that it is impossible to determine the exact line of 
<A NAME="36"></A>demarcation, nor on which side thereof an intermediate form should lie. 
<A NAME="37"></A>Thus, next after lifeless things in the upward scale comes the plant, and 
<A NAME="38"></A>of plants one will differ from another as to its amount of apparent vitality; 
<A NAME="39"></A>and, in a word, the whole genus of plants, whilst it is devoid of life 
<A NAME="40"></A>as compared with an animal, is endowed with life as compared with other 
<A NAME="41"></A>corporeal entities. Indeed, as we just remarked, there is observed in plants 
<A NAME="42"></A>a continuous scale of ascent towards the animal. So, in the sea, there 
<A NAME="43"></A>are certain objects concerning which one would be at a loss to determine 
<A NAME="44"></A>whether they be animal or vegetable. For instance, certain of these objects 
<A NAME="45"></A>are fairly rooted, and in several cases perish if detached; thus the pinna 
<A NAME="46"></A>is rooted to a particular spot, and the solen (or razor-shell) cannot survive 
<A NAME="47"></A>withdrawal from its burrow. Indeed, broadly speaking, the entire genus 
<A NAME="48"></A>of testaceans have a resemblance to vegetables, if they be contrasted with 
<A NAME="49"></A>such animals as are capable of progression.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>In regard to sensibility, some animals give no indication whatsoever 
<A NAME="51"></A>of it, whilst others indicate it but indistinctly. Further, the substance 
<A NAME="52"></A>of some of these intermediate creatures is fleshlike, as is the case with 
<A NAME="53"></A>the so-called tethya (or ascidians) and the acalephae (or sea-anemones); 
<A NAME="54"></A>but the sponge is in every respect like a vegetable. And so throughout 
<A NAME="55"></A>the entire animal scale there is a graduated differentiation in amount 
<A NAME="56"></A>of vitality and in capacity for motion.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>A similar statement holds good with regard to habits of life. Thus 
<A NAME="58"></A>of plants that spring from seed the one function seems to be the reproduction 
<A NAME="59"></A>of their own particular species, and the sphere of action with certain 
<A NAME="60"></A>animals is similarly limited. The faculty of reproduction, then, is common 
<A NAME="61"></A>to all alike. If sensibility be superadded, then their lives will differ 
<A NAME="62"></A>from one another in respect to sexual intercourse through the varying amount 
<A NAME="63"></A>of pleasure derived therefrom, and also in regard to modes of parturition 
<A NAME="64"></A>and ways of rearing their young. Some animals, like plants, simply procreate 
<A NAME="65"></A>their own species at definite seasons; other animals busy themselves also 
<A NAME="66"></A>in procuring food for their young, and after they are reared quit them 
<A NAME="67"></A>and have no further dealings with them; other animals are more intelligent 
<A NAME="68"></A>and endowed with memory, and they live with their offspring for a longer 
<A NAME="69"></A>period and on a more social footing.
<A NAME="70"></A><BR><BR>The life of animals, then, may be divided into two acts-procreation 
<A NAME="71"></A>and feeding; for on these two acts all their interests and life concentrate. 
<A NAME="72"></A>Their food depends chiefly on the substance of which they are severally 
<A NAME="73"></A>constituted; for the source of their growth in all cases will be this substance. 
<A NAME="74"></A>And whatsoever is in conformity with nature is pleasant, and all animals 
<A NAME="75"></A>pursue pleasure in keeping with their nature.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="76"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>Animals are also differentiated locally: that is to say, some live 
<A NAME="78"></A>upon dry land, while others live in the water. And this differentiation 
<A NAME="79"></A>may be interpreted in two different ways. Thus, some animals are termed 
<A NAME="80"></A>terrestrial as inhaling air, and others aquatic as taking in water; and 
<A NAME="81"></A>there are others which do not actually take in these elements, but nevertheless 
<A NAME="82"></A>are constitutionally adapted to the cooling influence, so far as is needful 
<A NAME="83"></A>to them, of one element or the other, and hence are called terrestrial 
<A NAME="84"></A>or aquatic though they neither breathe air nor take in water. Again, other 
<A NAME="85"></A>animals are so called from their finding their food and fixing their habitat 
<A NAME="86"></A>on land or in water: for many animals, although they inhale air and breed 
<A NAME="87"></A>on land, yet derive their food from the water, and live in water for the 
<A NAME="88"></A>greater part of their lives; and these are the only animals to which as 
<A NAME="89"></A>living in and on two elements the term 'amphibious' is applicable. There 
<A NAME="90"></A>is no animal taking in water that is terrestrial or aerial or that derives 
<A NAME="91"></A>its food from the land, whereas of the great number of land animals inhaling 
<A NAME="92"></A>air many get their food from the water; moreover some are so peculiarly 
<A NAME="93"></A>organized that if they be shut off altogether from the water they cannot 
<A NAME="94"></A>possibly live, as for instance, the so-called sea-turtle, the crocodile, 
<A NAME="95"></A>the hippopotamus, the seal, and some of the smaller creatures, such as 
<A NAME="96"></A>the fresh-water tortoise and the frog: now all these animals choke or drown 
<A NAME="97"></A>if they do not from time to time breathe atmospheric air: they breed and 
<A NAME="98"></A>rear their young on dry land, or near the land, but they pass their lives 
<A NAME="99"></A>in water.
<A NAME="100"></A><BR><BR>But the dolphin is equipped in the most remarkable way of all animals: 
<A NAME="101"></A>the dolphin and other similar aquatic animals, including the other cetaceans 
<A NAME="102"></A>which resemble it; that is to say, the whale, and all the other creatures 
<A NAME="103"></A>that are furnished with a blow-hole. One can hardly allow that such an 
<A NAME="104"></A>animal is terrestrial and terrestrial only, or aquatic and aquatic only, 
<A NAME="105"></A>if by terrestrial we mean an animal that inhales air, and if by aquatic 
<A NAME="106"></A>we mean an animal that takes in water. For the fact is the dolphin performs 
<A NAME="107"></A>both these processes: he takes in water and discharges it by his blow-hole, 
<A NAME="108"></A>and he also inhales air into his lungs; for, by the way, the creature is 
<A NAME="109"></A>furnished with this organ and respires thereby, and accordingly, when caught 
<A NAME="110"></A>in the nets, he is quickly suffocated for lack of air. He can also live 
<A NAME="111"></A>for a considerable while out of the water, but all this while he keeps 
<A NAME="112"></A>up a dull moaning sound corresponding to the noise made by air-breathing 
<A NAME="113"></A>animals in general; furthermore, when sleeping, the animal keeps his nose 
<A NAME="114"></A>above water, and he does so that he may breathe the air. Now it would be 
<A NAME="115"></A>unreasonable to assign one and the same class of animals to both categories, 
<A NAME="116"></A>terrestrial and aquatic, seeing that these categories are more or less 
<A NAME="117"></A>exclusive of one another; we must accordingly supplement our definition 
<A NAME="118"></A>of the term 'aquatic' or 'marine'. For the fact is, some aquatic animals 
<A NAME="119"></A>take in water and discharge it again, for the same reason that leads air-breathing 
<A NAME="120"></A>animals to inhale air: in other words, with the object of cooling the blood. 
<A NAME="121"></A>Others take in water as incidental to their mode of feeding; for as they 
<A NAME="122"></A>get their food in the water they cannot but take in water along with their 
<A NAME="123"></A>food, and if they take in water they must be provided with some organ for 
<A NAME="124"></A>discharging it. Those blooded animals, then, that use water for a purpose 
<A NAME="125"></A>analogous to respiration are provided with gills; and such as take in water 
<A NAME="126"></A>when catching their prey, with the blow-hole. Similar remarks are applicable 
<A NAME="127"></A>to molluscs and crustaceans; for again it is by way of procuring food that 
<A NAME="128"></A>these creatures take in water.
<A NAME="129"></A><BR><BR>Aquatic in different ways, the differences depending on bodily 
<A NAME="130"></A>relation to external temperature and on habit of life, are such animals 
<A NAME="131"></A>on the one hand as take in air but live in water, and such on the other 
<A NAME="132"></A>hand as take in water and are furnished with gills but go upon dry land 
<A NAME="133"></A>and get their living there. At present only one animal of the latter kind 
<A NAME="134"></A>is known, the so-called cordylus or water-newt; this creature is furnished 
<A NAME="135"></A>not with lungs but with gills, but for all that it is a quadruped and fitted 
<A NAME="136"></A>for walking on dry land.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>In the case of all these animals their nature appears in some kind 
<A NAME="138"></A>of a way to have got warped, just as some male animals get to resemble 
<A NAME="139"></A>the female, and some female animals the male. The fact is that animals, 
<A NAME="140"></A>if they be subjected to a modification in minute organs, are liable to 
<A NAME="141"></A>immense modifications in their general configuration. This phenomenon may 
<A NAME="142"></A>be observed in the case of gelded animals: only a minute organ of the animal 
<A NAME="143"></A>is mutilated, and the creature passes from the male to the female form. 
<A NAME="144"></A>We may infer, then, that if in the primary conformation of the embryo an 
<A NAME="145"></A>infinitesimally minute but absolutely essential organ sustain a change 
<A NAME="146"></A>of magnitude one way or the other, the animal will in one case turn to 
<A NAME="147"></A>male and in the other to female; and also that, if the said organ be obliterated 
<A NAME="148"></A>altogether, the animal will be of neither one sex nor the other. And so 
<A NAME="149"></A>by the occurrence of modification in minute organs it comes to pass that 
<A NAME="150"></A>one animal is terrestrial and another aquatic, in both senses of these 
<A NAME="151"></A>terms. And, again, some animals are amphibious whilst other animals are 
<A NAME="152"></A>not amphibious, owing to the circumstance that in their conformation while 
<A NAME="153"></A>in the embryonic condition there got intermixed into them some portion 
<A NAME="154"></A>of the matter of which their subsequent food is constituted; for, as was 
<A NAME="155"></A>said above, what is in conformity with nature is to every single animal 
<A NAME="156"></A>pleasant and agreeable.
<A NAME="157"></A><BR><BR>Animals then have been categorized into terrestrial and aquatic 
<A NAME="158"></A>in three ways, according to their assumption of air or of water, the temperament 
<A NAME="159"></A>of their bodies, or the character of their food; and the mode of life of 
<A NAME="160"></A>an animal corresponds to the category in which it is found. That is to 
<A NAME="161"></A>say, in some cases the animal depends for its terrestrial or aquatic nature 
<A NAME="162"></A>on temperament and diet combined, as well as upon its method of respiration; 
<A NAME="163"></A>and sometimes on temperament and habits alone.
<A NAME="164"></A><BR><BR>Of testaceans, some, that are incapable of motion, subsist on fresh 
<A NAME="165"></A>water, for, as the sea water dissolves into its constituents, the fresh 
<A NAME="166"></A>water from its greater thinness percolates through the grosser parts; in 
<A NAME="167"></A>fact, they live on fresh water just as they were originally engendered 
<A NAME="168"></A>from the same. Now that fresh water is contained in the sea and can be 
<A NAME="169"></A>strained off from it can be proved in a thoroughly practical way. Take 
<A NAME="170"></A>a thin vessel of moulded wax, attach a cord to it, and let it down quite 
<A NAME="171"></A>empty into the sea: in twenty-four hours it will be found to contain a 
<A NAME="172"></A>quantity of water, and the water will be fresh and drinkable.
<A NAME="173"></A><BR><BR>Sea-anemones feed on such small fishes as come in their way. The 
<A NAME="174"></A>mouth of this creature is in the middle of its body; and this fact may 
<A NAME="175"></A>be clearly observed in the case of the larger varieties. Like the oyster 
<A NAME="176"></A>it has a duct for the outlet of the residuum; and this duct is at the top 
<A NAME="177"></A>of the animal. In other words, the sea-anemone corresponds to the inner 
<A NAME="178"></A>fleshy part of the oyster, and the stone to which the one creature clings 
<A NAME="179"></A>corresponds to the shell which encases the other.
<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>The limpet detaches itself from the rock and goes about in quest 
<A NAME="181"></A>of food. Of shell-fish that are mobile, some are carnivorous and live on 
<A NAME="182"></A>little fishes, as for instance, the purple murex-and there can be no doubt 
<A NAME="183"></A>that the purple murex is carnivorous, as it is caught by a bait of fish; 
<A NAME="184"></A>others are carnivorous, but feed also on marine vegetation.
<A NAME="185"></A><BR><BR>The sea-turtles feed on shell-fish-for, by the way, their mouths 
<A NAME="186"></A>are extraordinarily hard; whatever object it seizes, stone or other, it 
<A NAME="187"></A>crunches into bits, but when it leaves the water for dry land it browses 
<A NAME="188"></A>on grass). These creatures suffer greatly, and oftentimes die when they 
<A NAME="189"></A>lie on the surface of the water exposed to a scorching sun; for, when once 
<A NAME="190"></A>they have risen to the surface, they find a difficulty in sinking 
<A NAME="191"></A>again.
<A NAME="192"></A><BR><BR>Crustaceans feed in like manner. They are omnivorous; that is to 
<A NAME="193"></A>say, they live on stones, slime, sea-weed, and excrement-as for instance 
<A NAME="194"></A>the rock-crab-and are also carnivorous. The crawfish or spiny-lobster can 
<A NAME="195"></A>get the better of fishes even of the larger species, though in some of 
<A NAME="196"></A>them it occasionally finds more than its match. Thus, this animal is so 
<A NAME="197"></A>overmastered and cowed by the octopus that it dies of terror if it become 
<A NAME="198"></A>aware of an octopus in the same net with itself. The crawfish can master 
<A NAME="199"></A>the conger-eel, for owing to the rough spines of the crawfish the eel cannot 
<A NAME="200"></A>slip away and elude its hold. The conger-eel, however, devours the octopus, 
<A NAME="201"></A>for owing to the slipperiness of its antagonist the octopus can make nothing 
<A NAME="202"></A>of it. The crawfish feeds on little fish, capturing them beside its hole 
<A NAME="203"></A>or dwelling place; for, by the way, it is found out at sea on rough and 
<A NAME="204"></A>stony bottoms, and in such places it makes its den. Whatever it catches, 
<A NAME="205"></A>it puts into its mouth with its pincer-like claws, like the common crab. 
<A NAME="206"></A>Its nature is to walk straight forward when it has nothing to fear, with 
<A NAME="207"></A>its feelers hanging sideways; if it be frightened, it makes its escape 
<A NAME="208"></A>backwards, darting off to a great distance. These animals fight one another 
<A NAME="209"></A>with their claws, just as rams fight with their horns, raising them and 
<A NAME="210"></A>striking their opponents; they are often also seen crowded together in 
<A NAME="211"></A>herds. So much for the mode of life of the crustacean.
<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>Molluscs are all carnivorous; and of molluscs the calamary and 
<A NAME="213"></A>the sepia are more than a match for fishes even of the large species. The 
<A NAME="214"></A>octopus for the most part gathers shellfish, extracts the flesh, and feeds 
<A NAME="215"></A>on that; in fact, fishermen recognize their holes by the number of shells 
<A NAME="216"></A>lying about. Some say that the octopus devours its own species, but this 
<A NAME="217"></A>statement is incorrect; it is doubtless founded on the fact that the creature 
<A NAME="218"></A>is often found with its tentacles removed, which tentacles have really 
<A NAME="219"></A>been eaten off by the conger.
<A NAME="220"></A><BR><BR>Fishes, all without exception, feed on spawn in the spawning season; 
<A NAME="221"></A>but in other respects the food varies with the varying species. Some fishes 
<A NAME="222"></A>are exclusively carnivorous, as the cartilaginous genus, the conger, the 
<A NAME="223"></A>channa or Serranus, the tunny, the bass, the synodon or Dentex, the amia, 
<A NAME="224"></A>the sea-perch, and the muraena. The red mullet is carnivorous, but feeds 
<A NAME="225"></A>also on sea-weed, on shell-fish, and on mud. The grey mullet feeds on mud, 
<A NAME="226"></A>the dascyllus on mud and offal, the scarus or parrot-fish and the melanurus 
<A NAME="227"></A>on sea-weed, the saupe on offal and sea-weed; the saupe feeds also on zostera, 
<A NAME="228"></A>and is the only fish that is captured with a gourd. All fishes devour their 
<A NAME="229"></A>own species, with the single exception of the cestreus or mullet; and the 
<A NAME="230"></A>conger is especially ravenous in this respect. The cephalus and the mullet 
<A NAME="231"></A>in general are the only fish that eat no flesh; this may be inferred from 
<A NAME="232"></A>the facts that when caught they are never found with flesh in their intestines, 
<A NAME="233"></A>and that the bait used to catch them is not flesh but barley-cake. Every 
<A NAME="234"></A>fish of the mullet-kind lives on sea-weed and sand. The cephalus, called 
<A NAME="235"></A>by some the 'chelon', keeps near in to the shore, the peraeas keeps out 
<A NAME="236"></A>at a distance from it, and feeds on a mucous substance exuding from itself, 
<A NAME="237"></A>and consequently is always in a starved condition. The cephalus lives in 
<A NAME="238"></A>mud, and is in consequence heavy and slimy; it never feeds on any other 
<A NAME="239"></A>fish. As it lives in mud, it has every now and then to make a leap upwards 
<A NAME="240"></A>out of the mud so as to wash the slime from off its body. There is no creature 
<A NAME="241"></A>known to prey upon the spawn of the cephalus, so that the species is exceedingly 
<A NAME="242"></A>numerous; when, however, the is full-grown it is preyed upon by a number 
<A NAME="243"></A>of fishes, and especially by the acharnas or bass. Of all fishes the mullet 
<A NAME="244"></A>is the most voracious and insatiable, and in consequence its belly is kept 
<A NAME="245"></A>at full stretch; whenever it is not starving, it may be considered as out 
<A NAME="246"></A>of condition. When it is frightened, it hides its head in mud, under the 
<A NAME="247"></A>notion that it is hiding its whole body. The synodon is carnivorous and 
<A NAME="248"></A>feeds on molluscs. Very often the synodon and the channa cast up their 
<A NAME="249"></A>stomachs while chasing smaller fishes; for, be it remembered, fishes have 
<A NAME="250"></A>their stomachs close to the mouth, and are not furnished with a 
<A NAME="251"></A>gullet.
<A NAME="252"></A><BR><BR>Some fishes then, as has been stated, are carnivorous, and carnivorous 
<A NAME="253"></A>only, as the dolphin, the synodon, the gilt-head, the selachians, and the 
<A NAME="254"></A>molluscs. Other fishes feed habitually on mud or sea-weed or sea-moss or 
<A NAME="255"></A>the so-called stalk-weed or growing plants; as for instance, the phycis, 
<A NAME="256"></A>the goby, and the rock-fish; and, by the way, the only meat that the phycis 
<A NAME="257"></A>will touch is that of prawns. Very often, however, as has been stated, 
<A NAME="258"></A>they devour one another, and especially do the larger ones devour the smaller. 
<A NAME="259"></A>The proof of their being carnivorous is the fact that they can be caught 
<A NAME="260"></A>with flesh for a bait. The mackerel, the tunny, and the bass are for the 
<A NAME="261"></A>most part carnivorous, but they do occasionally feed on sea-weed. The sargue 
<A NAME="262"></A>feeds on the leavings of the trigle or red mullet. The red mullet burrows 
<A NAME="263"></A>in the mud, when it sets the mud in motion and quits its haunt, the sargue 
<A NAME="264"></A>settles down into the place and feeds on what is left behind, and prevents 
<A NAME="265"></A>any smaller fish from settling in the immediate vicinity.
<A NAME="266"></A><BR><BR>Of all fishes the so-called scarus, or parrot, wrasse, is the only 
<A NAME="267"></A>one known to chew the cud like a quadruped.
<A NAME="268"></A><BR><BR>As a general rule the larger fishes catch the smaller ones in their 
<A NAME="269"></A>mouths whilst swimming straight after them in the ordinary position; but 
<A NAME="270"></A>the selachians, the dolphin, and all the cetacea must first turn over on 
<A NAME="271"></A>their backs, as their mouths are placed down below; this allows a fair 
<A NAME="272"></A>chance of escape to the smaller fishes, and, indeed, if it were not so, 
<A NAME="273"></A>there would be very few of the little fishes left, for the speed and voracity 
<A NAME="274"></A>of the dolphin is something marvellous.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>Of eels a few here and there feed on mud and on chance morsels 
<A NAME="276"></A>of food thrown to them; the greater part of them subsist on fresh water. 
<A NAME="277"></A>Eel-breeders are particularly careful to have the water kept perfectly 
<A NAME="278"></A>clear, by its perpetually flowing on to flat slabs of stone and then flowing 
<A NAME="279"></A>off again; sometimes they coat the eel-tanks with plaster. The fact is 
<A NAME="280"></A>that the eel will soon choke if the water is not clear as his gills are 
<A NAME="281"></A>peculiarly small. On this account, when fishing for eels, they disturb 
<A NAME="282"></A>the water. In the river Strymon eel-fishing takes place at the rising of 
<A NAME="283"></A>the Pleiads, because at this period the water is troubled and the mud raised 
<A NAME="284"></A>up by contrary winds; unless the water be in this condition, it is as well 
<A NAME="285"></A>to leave the eels alone. When dead the eel, unlike the majority of fishes, 
<A NAME="286"></A>neither floats on nor rises to the surface; and this is owing to the smallness 
<A NAME="287"></A>of the stomach. A few eels are supplied with fat, but the greater part 
<A NAME="288"></A>have no fat whatsoever. When removed from the water they can live for five 
<A NAME="289"></A>or six days; for a longer period if north winds prevail, for a shorter 
<A NAME="290"></A>if south winds. If they are removed in summer from the pools to the tanks 
<A NAME="291"></A>they will die; but not so if removed in the winter. They are not capable 
<A NAME="292"></A>of holding out against any abrupt change; consequently they often die in 
<A NAME="293"></A>large numbers when men engaged in transporting them from one place to another 
<A NAME="294"></A>dip them into water particularly cold. They will also die of suffocation 
<A NAME="295"></A>if they be kept in a scanty supply of water. This same remark will hold 
<A NAME="296"></A>good for fishes in general; for they are suffocated if they be long confined 
<A NAME="297"></A>in a short supply of water, with the water kept unchanged-just as animals 
<A NAME="298"></A>that respire are suffocated if they be shut up with a scanty supply of 
<A NAME="299"></A>air. The eel in some cases lives for seven or eight years. The river-eel 
<A NAME="300"></A>feeds on his own species, on grass, or on roots, or on any chance food 
<A NAME="301"></A>found in the mud. Their usual feeding-time is at night, and during the 
<A NAME="302"></A>day-time they retreat into deep water. And so much for the food of 
<A NAME="303"></A>fishes.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="304"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="305"></A><BR><BR>Of birds, such as have crooked talons are carnivorous without exception, 
<A NAME="306"></A>and cannot swallow corn or bread-food even if it be put into their bills 
<A NAME="307"></A>in tit-bits; as for instance, the eagle of every variety, the kite, the 
<A NAME="308"></A>two species of hawks, to wit, the dove-hawk and the sparrow-hawk-and, by 
<A NAME="309"></A>the way, these two hawks differ greatly in size from one another-and the 
<A NAME="310"></A>buzzard. The buzzard is of the same size as the kite, and is visible at 
<A NAME="311"></A>all seasons of the year. There is also the phene (or lammergeier) and the 
<A NAME="312"></A>vulture. The phene is larger than the common eagle and is ashen in colour. 
<A NAME="313"></A>Of the vulture there are two varieties: one small and whitish, the other 
<A NAME="314"></A>comparatively large and rather more ashen-coloured than white. Further, 
<A NAME="315"></A>of birds that fly by night, some have crooked talons, such as the night-raven, 
<A NAME="316"></A>the owl, and the eagle-owl. The eagle-owl resembles the common owl in shape, 
<A NAME="317"></A>but it is quite as large as the eagle. Again, there is the eleus, the Aegolian 
<A NAME="318"></A>owl, and the little horned owl. Of these birds, the eleus is somewhat larger 
<A NAME="319"></A>than the barn-door cock, and the Aegolian owl is of about the same size 
<A NAME="320"></A>as the eleus, and both these birds hunt the jay; the little horned owl 
<A NAME="321"></A>is smaller than the common owl. All these three birds are alike in appearance, 
<A NAME="322"></A>and all three are carnivorous.
<A NAME="323"></A><BR><BR>Again, of birds that have not crooked talons some are carnivorous, 
<A NAME="324"></A>such as the swallow. Others feed on grubs, such as the chaffinch, the sparrow, 
<A NAME="325"></A>the 'batis', the green linnet, and the titmouse. Of the titmouse there 
<A NAME="326"></A>are three varieties. The largest is the finch-titmouse--for it is about 
<A NAME="327"></A>the size of a finch; the second has a long tail, and from its habitat is 
<A NAME="328"></A>called the hill-titmouse; the third resembles the other two in appearance, 
<A NAME="329"></A>but is less in size than either of them. Then come the becca-fico, the 
<A NAME="330"></A>black-cap, the bull-finch, the robin, the epilais, the midget-bird, and 
<A NAME="331"></A>the golden-crested wren. This wren is little larger than a locust, has 
<A NAME="332"></A>a crest of bright red gold, and is in every way a beautiful and graceful 
<A NAME="333"></A>little bird. Then the anthus, a bird about the size of a finch; and the 
<A NAME="334"></A>mountain-finch, which resembles a finch and is of much the same size, but 
<A NAME="335"></A>its neck is blue, and it is named from its habitat; and lastly the wren 
<A NAME="336"></A>and the rook. The above-enumerated birds and the like of them feed either 
<A NAME="337"></A>wholly or for the most part on grubs, but the following and the like feed 
<A NAME="338"></A>on thistles; to wit, the linnet, the thraupis, and the goldfinch. All these 
<A NAME="339"></A>birds feed on thistles, but never on grubs or any living thing whatever; 
<A NAME="340"></A>they live and roost also on the plants from which they derive their 
<A NAME="341"></A>food.
<A NAME="342"></A><BR><BR>There are other birds whose favourite food consists of insects 
<A NAME="343"></A>found beneath the bark of trees; as for instance, the great and the small 
<A NAME="344"></A>pie, which are nicknamed the woodpeckers. These two birds resemble one 
<A NAME="345"></A>another in plumage and in note, only that the note of the larger bird is 
<A NAME="346"></A>the louder of the two; they both frequent the trunks of trees in quest 
<A NAME="347"></A>of food. There is also the greenpie, a bird about the size of a turtle-dove, 
<A NAME="348"></A>green-coloured all over, that pecks at the bark of trees with extraordinary 
<A NAME="349"></A>vigour, lives generally on the branch of a tree, has a loud note, and is 
<A NAME="350"></A>mostly found in the Peloponnese. There is another bird called the 'grub-picker' 
<A NAME="351"></A>(or tree-creeper), about as small as the penduline titmouse, with speckled 
<A NAME="352"></A>plumage of an ashen colour, and with a poor note; it is a variety of the 
<A NAME="353"></A>woodpecker.
<A NAME="354"></A><BR><BR>There are other birds that live on fruit and herbage, such as the 
<A NAME="355"></A>wild pigeon or ringdove, the common pigeon, the rock-dove, and the turtle-dove. 
<A NAME="356"></A>The ring-dove and the common pigeon are visible at all seasons; the turtledove 
<A NAME="357"></A>only in the summer, for in winter it lurks in some hole or other and is 
<A NAME="358"></A>never seen. The rock-dove is chiefly visible in the autumn, and is caught 
<A NAME="359"></A>at that season; it is larger than the common pigeon but smaller than the 
<A NAME="360"></A>wild one; it is generally caught while drinking. These pigeons bring their 
<A NAME="361"></A>young ones with them when they visit this country. All our other birds 
<A NAME="362"></A>come to us in the early summer and build their nests here, and the greater 
<A NAME="363"></A>part of them rear their young on animal food, with the sole exception of 
<A NAME="364"></A>the pigeon and its varieties.
<A NAME="365"></A><BR><BR>The whole genus of birds may be pretty well divided into such as 
<A NAME="366"></A>procure their food on dry land, such as frequent rivers and lakes, and 
<A NAME="367"></A>such as live on or by the sea.
<A NAME="368"></A><BR><BR>Of water-birds such as are web-footed live actually on the water, 
<A NAME="369"></A>while such as are split-footed live by the edge of it-and, by the way, 
<A NAME="370"></A>water-birds that are not carnivorous live on water-plants, (but most of 
<A NAME="371"></A>them live on fish), like the heron and the spoonbill that frequent the 
<A NAME="372"></A>banks of lakes and rivers; and the spoonbill, by the way, is less than 
<A NAME="373"></A>the common heron, and has a long flat bill. There are furthermore the stork 
<A NAME="374"></A>and the seamew; and the seamew, by the way, is ashen-coloured. There is 
<A NAME="375"></A>also the schoenilus, the cinclus, and the white-rump. Of these smaller 
<A NAME="376"></A>birds the last mentioned is the largest, being about the size of the common 
<A NAME="377"></A>thrush; all three may be described as 'wag-tails'. Then there is the scalidris, 
<A NAME="378"></A>with plumage ashen-grey, but speckled. Moreover, the family of the halcyons 
<A NAME="379"></A>or kingfishers live by the waterside. Of kingfishers there are two varieties; 
<A NAME="380"></A>one that sits on reeds and sings; the other, the larger of the two, is 
<A NAME="381"></A>without a note. Both these varieties are blue on the back. There is also 
<A NAME="382"></A>the trochilus (or sandpiper). The halcyon also, including a variety termed 
<A NAME="383"></A>the cerylus, is found near the seaside. The crow also feeds on such animal 
<A NAME="384"></A>life as is cast up on the beach, for the bird is omnivorous. There are 
<A NAME="385"></A>also the white gull, the cepphus, the aethyia, and the 
<A NAME="386"></A>charadrius.
<A NAME="387"></A><BR><BR>Of web-footed birds, the larger species live on the banks of rivers 
<A NAME="388"></A>and lakes; as the swan, the duck, the coot, the grebe, and the teal-a bird 
<A NAME="389"></A>resembling the duck but less in size-and the water-raven or cormorant. 
<A NAME="390"></A>This bird is the size of a stork, only that its legs are shorter; it is 
<A NAME="391"></A>web-footed and is a good swimmer; its plumage is black. It roosts on trees, 
<A NAME="392"></A>and is the only one of all such birds as these that is found to build its 
<A NAME="393"></A>nest in a tree. Further there is the large goose, the little gregarious 
<A NAME="394"></A>goose, the vulpanser, the horned grebe, and the penelops. The sea-eagle 
<A NAME="395"></A>lives in the neighbourhood of the sea and seeks its quarry in 
<A NAME="396"></A>lagoons.
<A NAME="397"></A><BR><BR>A great number of birds are omnivorous. Birds of prey feed on any 
<A NAME="398"></A>animal or bird, other than a bird of prey, that they may catch. These birds 
<A NAME="399"></A>never touch one of their own genus, whereas fishes often devour members 
<A NAME="400"></A>actually of their own species.
<A NAME="401"></A><BR><BR>Birds, as a rule, are very spare drinkers. In fact birds of prey 
<A NAME="402"></A>never drink at all, excepting a very few, and these drink very rarely; 
<A NAME="403"></A>and this last observation is peculiarly applicable to the kestrel. The 
<A NAME="404"></A>kite has been seen to drink, but he certainly drinks very 
<A NAME="405"></A>seldom.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="406"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="407"></A><BR><BR>Animals that are coated with tessellates-such as the lizard and 
<A NAME="408"></A>the other quadrupeds, and the serpents-are omnivorous: at all events they 
<A NAME="409"></A>are carnivorous and graminivorous; and serpents, by the way, are of all 
<A NAME="410"></A>animals the greatest gluttons.
<A NAME="411"></A><BR><BR>Tessellated animals are spare drinkers, as are also all such animals 
<A NAME="412"></A>as have a spongy lung, and such a lung, scantily supplied with blood, is 
<A NAME="413"></A>found in all oviparous animals. Serpents, by the by, have an insatiate 
<A NAME="414"></A>appetite for wine; consequently, at times men hunt for snakes by pouring 
<A NAME="415"></A>wine into saucers and putting them into the interstices of walls, and the 
<A NAME="416"></A>creatures are caught when inebriated. Serpents are carnivorous, and whenever 
<A NAME="417"></A>they catch an animal they extract all its juices and eject the creature 
<A NAME="418"></A>whole. And, by the way, this is done by all other creatures of similar 
<A NAME="419"></A>habits, as for instance the spider; only that the spider sucks out the 
<A NAME="420"></A>juices of its prey outside, and the serpent does so in its belly. The serpent 
<A NAME="421"></A>takes any food presented to him, eats birds and animals, and swallows eggs 
<A NAME="422"></A>entire. But after taking his prey he stretches himself until he stands 
<A NAME="423"></A>straight out to the very tip, and then he contracts and squeezes himself 
<A NAME="424"></A>into little compass, so that the swallowed mass may pass down his outstretched 
<A NAME="425"></A>body; and this action on his part is due to the tenuity and length of his 
<A NAME="426"></A>gullet. Spiders and snakes can both go without food for a long time; and 
<A NAME="427"></A>this remark may be verified by observation of specimens kept alive in the 
<A NAME="428"></A>shops of the apothecaries.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="429"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="430"></A><BR><BR>Of viviparous quadrupeds such as are fierce and jag-toothed are 
<A NAME="431"></A>without exception carnivorous; though, by the way, it is stated of the 
<A NAME="432"></A>wolf, but of no other animal, that in extremity of hunger it will eat a 
<A NAME="433"></A>certain kind of earth. These carnivorous animals never eat grass except 
<A NAME="434"></A>when they are sick, just as dogs bring on a vomit by eating grass and thereby 
<A NAME="435"></A>purge themselves.
<A NAME="436"></A><BR><BR>The solitary wolf is more apt to attack man than the wolf that 
<A NAME="437"></A>goes with a pack.
<A NAME="438"></A><BR><BR>The animal called 'glanus' by some and 'hyaena' by others is as 
<A NAME="439"></A>large as a wolf, with a mane like a horse, only that the hair is stiffer 
<A NAME="440"></A>and longer and extends over the entire length of the chine. It will lie 
<A NAME="441"></A>in wait for a man and chase him, and will inveigle a dog within its reach 
<A NAME="442"></A>by making a noise that resembles the retching noise of a man vomiting. 
<A NAME="443"></A>It is exceedingly fond of putrefied flesh, and will burrow in a graveyard 
<A NAME="444"></A>to gratify this propensity.
<A NAME="445"></A><BR><BR>The bear is omnivorous. It eats fruit, and is enabled by the suppleness 
<A NAME="446"></A>of its body to climb a tree; it also eats vegetables, and it will break 
<A NAME="447"></A>up a hive to get at the honey; it eats crabs and ants also, and is in a 
<A NAME="448"></A>general way carnivorous. It is so powerful that it will attack not only 
<A NAME="449"></A>the deer but the wild boar, if it can take it unawares, and also the bull. 
<A NAME="450"></A>After coming to close quarters with the bull it falls on its back in front 
<A NAME="451"></A>of the animal, and, when the bull proceeds to butt, the bear seizes hold 
<A NAME="452"></A>of the bull's horns with its front paws, fastens its teeth into his shoulder, 
<A NAME="453"></A>and drags him down to the ground. For a short time together it can walk 
<A NAME="454"></A>erect on its hind legs. All the flesh it eats it first allows to become 
<A NAME="455"></A>carrion.
<A NAME="456"></A><BR><BR>The lion, like all other savage and jag-toothed animals, is carnivorous. 
<A NAME="457"></A>It devours its food greedily and fiercely, and often swallows its prey 
<A NAME="458"></A>entire without rending it at all; it will then go fasting for two or three 
<A NAME="459"></A>days together, being rendered capable of this abstinence by its previous 
<A NAME="460"></A>surfeit. It is a spare drinker. It discharges the solid residuum in small 
<A NAME="461"></A>quantities, about every other day or at irregular intervals, and the substance 
<A NAME="462"></A>of it is hard and dry like the excrement of a dog. The wind discharged 
<A NAME="463"></A>from off its stomach is pungent, and its urine emits a strong odour, a 
<A NAME="464"></A>phenomenon which, in the case of dogs, accounts for their habit of sniffing 
<A NAME="465"></A>at trees; for, by the way, the lion, like the dog, lifts its leg to void 
<A NAME="466"></A>its urine. It infects the food it eats with a strong smell by breathing 
<A NAME="467"></A>on it, and when the animal is cut open an overpowering vapour exhales from 
<A NAME="468"></A>its inside.
<A NAME="469"></A><BR><BR>Some wild quadrupeds feed in lakes and rivers; the seal is the 
<A NAME="470"></A>only one that gets its living on the sea. To the former class of animals 
<A NAME="471"></A>belong the so-called castor, the satyrium, the otter, and the so-called 
<A NAME="472"></A>latax, or beaver. The beaver is flatter than the otter and has strong teeth; 
<A NAME="473"></A>it often at night-time emerges from the water and goes nibbling at the 
<A NAME="474"></A>bark of the aspens that fringe the riversides. The otter will bite a man, 
<A NAME="475"></A>and it is said that whenever it bites it will never let go until it hears 
<A NAME="476"></A>a bone crack. The hair of the beaver is rough, intermediate in appearance 
<A NAME="477"></A>between the hair of the seal and the hair of the deer.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="478"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="479"></A><BR><BR>Jag-toothed animals drink by lapping, as do also some animals with 
<A NAME="480"></A>teeth differently formed, as the mouse. Animals whose upper and lower teeth 
<A NAME="481"></A>meet evenly drink by suction, as the horse and the ox; the bear neither 
<A NAME="482"></A>laps nor sucks, but gulps down his drink. Birds, a rule, drink by suction, 
<A NAME="483"></A>but the long necked birds stop and elevate their heads at intervals; the 
<A NAME="484"></A>purple coot is the only one (of the long-necked birds) that swallows water 
<A NAME="485"></A>by gulps.
<A NAME="486"></A><BR><BR>Horned animals, domesticated or wild, and all such as are not jag-toothed, 
<A NAME="487"></A>are all frugivorous and graminivorous, save under great stress of hunger. 
<A NAME="488"></A>The pig is an exception, it cares little for grass or fruit, but of all 
<A NAME="489"></A>animals it is the fondest of roots, owing to the fact that its snout is 
<A NAME="490"></A>peculiarly adapted for digging them out of the ground; it is also of all 
<A NAME="491"></A>animals the most easily pleased in the matter of food. It takes on fat 
<A NAME="492"></A>more rapidly in proportion to its size than any other animal; in fact, 
<A NAME="493"></A>a pig can be fattened for the market in sixty days. Pig-dealers can tell 
<A NAME="494"></A>the amount of flesh taken on, by having first weighed the animal while 
<A NAME="495"></A>it was being starved. Before the fattening process begins, the creature 
<A NAME="496"></A>must be starved for three days; and, by the way, animals in general will 
<A NAME="497"></A>take on fat if subjected previously to a course of starvation; after the 
<A NAME="498"></A>three days of starvation, pig-breeders feed the animal lavishly. Breeders 
<A NAME="499"></A>in Thrace, when fattening pigs, give them a drink on the first day; then 
<A NAME="500"></A>they miss one, and then two days, then three and four, until the interval 
<A NAME="501"></A>extends over seven days. The pigs' meat used for fattening is composed 
<A NAME="502"></A>of barley, millet, figs, acorns, wild pears, and cucumbers. These animals-and 
<A NAME="503"></A>other animals that have warm bellies-are fattened by repose. (Pigs also 
<A NAME="504"></A>fatten the better by being allowed to wallow in mud. They like to feed 
<A NAME="505"></A>in batches of the same age. A pig will give battle even to a wolf.) If 
<A NAME="506"></A>a pig be weighed when living, you may calculate that after death its flesh 
<A NAME="507"></A>will weigh five-sixths of that weight, and the hair, the blood, and the 
<A NAME="508"></A>rest will weigh the other sixth. When suckling their young, swinelike all 
<A NAME="509"></A>other animals-get attenuated. So much for these animals.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="510"></A><B>Part 7</B>

<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>Cattle feed on corn and grass, and fatten on vegetables that tend 
<A NAME="512"></A>to cause flatulency, such as bitter vetch or bruised beans or bean-stalks. 
<A NAME="513"></A>The older ones also will fatten if they be fed up after an incision has 
<A NAME="514"></A>been made into their hide, and air blown thereinto. Cattle will fatten 
<A NAME="515"></A>also on barley in its natural state or on barley finely winnowed, or on 
<A NAME="516"></A>sweet food, such as figs, or pulp from the wine-press, or on elm-leaves. 
<A NAME="517"></A>But nothing is so fattening as the heat of the sun and wallowing in warm 
<A NAME="518"></A>waters. If the horns of young cattle be smeared with hot wax, you may mold 
<A NAME="519"></A>them to any shape you please, and cattle are less subject to disease of 
<A NAME="520"></A>the hoof if you smear the horny parts with wax, pitch, or olive oil. Herded 
<A NAME="521"></A>cattle suffer more when they are forced to change their pasture ground 
<A NAME="522"></A>by frost than when snow is the cause of change. Cattle grow all the more 
<A NAME="523"></A>in size when they are kept from sexual commerce over a number of years; 
<A NAME="524"></A>and it is with a view to growth in size that in Epirus the so-called Pyrrhic 
<A NAME="525"></A>kine are not allowed intercourse with the bull until they are nine years 
<A NAME="526"></A>old; from which circumstance they are nicknamed the 'unbulled' kine. Of 
<A NAME="527"></A>these Pyrrhic cattle, by the way, they say that there are only about four 
<A NAME="528"></A>hundred in the world, that they are the private property of the Epirote 
<A NAME="529"></A>royal family, that they cannot thrive out of Epirus, and that people elsewhere 
<A NAME="530"></A>have tried to rear them, but without success.

<A NAME="531"></A><B>Part 8</B>

<A NAME="532"></A><BR><BR>Horses, mules, and asses feed on corn and grass, but are fattened 
<A NAME="533"></A>chiefly by drink. Just in proportion as beasts of burden drink water, so 
<A NAME="534"></A>will they more or less enjoy their food, and a place will give good or 
<A NAME="535"></A>bad feeding according as the water is good or bad. Green corn, while ripening, 
<A NAME="536"></A>will give a smooth coat; but such corn is injurious if the spikes are too 
<A NAME="537"></A>stiff and sharp. The first crop of clover is unwholesome, and so is clover 
<A NAME="538"></A>over which ill-scented water runs; for the clover is sure to get the taint 
<A NAME="539"></A>of the water. Cattle like clear water for drinking; but the horse in this 
<A NAME="540"></A>respect resembles the camel, for the camel likes turbid and thick water, 
<A NAME="541"></A>and will never drink from a stream until he has trampled it into a turbid 
<A NAME="542"></A>condition. And, by the way, the camel can go without water for as much 
<A NAME="543"></A>as four days, but after that when he drinks, he drinks in immense 
<A NAME="544"></A>quantities.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="545"></A><B>Part 9</B>

<A NAME="546"></A><BR><BR>The elephant at the most can eat nine Macedonian medimni of fodder 
<A NAME="547"></A>at one meal; but so large an amount is unwholesome. As a general rule it 
<A NAME="548"></A>can take six or seven medimni of fodder, five medimni of wheat, and five 
<A NAME="549"></A>mareis of wine-six cotylae going to the maris. An elephant has been known 
<A NAME="550"></A>to drink right off fourteen Macedonian metretae of water, and another metretae 
<A NAME="551"></A>later in the day.
<A NAME="552"></A><BR><BR>Camels live for about thirty years; in some exceptional cases they 
<A NAME="553"></A>live much longer, and instances have been known of their living to the 
<A NAME="554"></A>age of a hundred. The elephant is said by some to live for about two hundred 
<A NAME="555"></A>years; by others, for three hundred.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="556"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="557"></A><BR><BR>Sheep and goats are graminivorous, but sheep browse assiduously 
<A NAME="558"></A>and steadily, whereas goats shift their ground rapidly, and browse only 
<A NAME="559"></A>on the tips of the herbage. Sheep are much improved in condition by drinking, 
<A NAME="560"></A>and accordingly they give the flocks salt every five days in summer, to 
<A NAME="561"></A>the extent of one medimnus to the hundred sheep, and this is found to render 
<A NAME="562"></A>a flock healthier and fatter. In fact they mix salt with the greater part 
<A NAME="563"></A>of their food; a large amount of salt is mixed into their bran (for the 
<A NAME="564"></A>reason that they drink more when thirsty), and in autumn they get cucumbers 
<A NAME="565"></A>with a sprinkling of salt on them; this admixture of salt in their food 
<A NAME="566"></A>tends also to increase the quantity of milk in the ewes. If sheep be kept 
<A NAME="567"></A>on the move at midday they will drink more copiously towards evening; and 
<A NAME="568"></A>if the ewes be fed with salted food as the lambing season draws near they 
<A NAME="569"></A>will get larger udders. Sheep are fattened by twigs of the olive or of 
<A NAME="570"></A>the oleaster, by vetch, and bran of every kind; and these articles of food 
<A NAME="571"></A>fatten all the more if they be first sprinkled with brine. Sheep will take 
<A NAME="572"></A>on flesh all the better if they be first put for three days through a process 
<A NAME="573"></A>of starving. In autumn, water from the north is more wholesome for sheep 
<A NAME="574"></A>than water from the south. Pasture grounds are all the better if they have 
<A NAME="575"></A>a westerly aspect.
<A NAME="576"></A><BR><BR>Sheep will lose flesh if they be kept overmuch on the move or be 
<A NAME="577"></A>subjected to any hardship. In winter time shepherds can easily distinguish 
<A NAME="578"></A>the vigorous sheep from the weakly, from the fact that the vigorous sheep 
<A NAME="579"></A>are covered with hoar-frost while the weakly ones are quite free of it; 
<A NAME="580"></A>the fact being that the weakly ones feeling oppressed with the burden shake 
<A NAME="581"></A>themselves and so get rid of it. The flesh of all quadrupeds deteriorates 
<A NAME="582"></A>in marshy pastures, and is the better on high grounds. Sheep that have 
<A NAME="583"></A>flat tails can stand the winter better than long-tailed sheep, and short-fleeced 
<A NAME="584"></A>sheep than the shaggy-fleeced; and sheep with crisp wool stand the rigour 
<A NAME="585"></A>of winter very poorly. Sheep are healthier than goats, but goats are stronger 
<A NAME="586"></A>than sheep. (The fleeces and the wool of sheep that have been killed by 
<A NAME="587"></A>wolves, as also the clothes made from them, are exceptionally infested 
<A NAME="588"></A>with lice.)
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="589"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="590"></A><BR><BR>Of insects, such as have teeth are omnivorous; such as have a tongue 
<A NAME="591"></A>feed on liquids only, extracting with that organ juices from all quarters. 
<A NAME="592"></A>And of these latter some may be called omnivorous, inasmuch as they feed 
<A NAME="593"></A>on every kind of juice, as for instance, the common fly; others are blood-suckers, 
<A NAME="594"></A>such as the gadfly and the horse-fly, others again live on the juices of 
<A NAME="595"></A>fruits and plants. The bee is the only insect that invariably eschews whatever 
<A NAME="596"></A>is rotten; it will touch no article of food unless it have a sweet-tasting 
<A NAME="597"></A>juice, and it is particularly fond of drinking water if it be found bubbling 
<A NAME="598"></A>up clear from a spring underground.
<A NAME="599"></A><BR><BR>So much for the food of animals of the leading 
<A NAME="600"></A>genera.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="601"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="602"></A><BR><BR>The habits of animals are all connected with either breeding and 
<A NAME="603"></A>the rearing of young, or with the procuring a due supply of food; and these 
<A NAME="604"></A>habits are modified so as to suit cold and heat and the variations of the 
<A NAME="605"></A>seasons. For all animals have an instinctive perception of the changes 
<A NAME="606"></A>of temperature, and, just as men seek shelter in houses in winter, or as 
<A NAME="607"></A>men of great possessions spend their summer in cool places and their winter 
<A NAME="608"></A>in sunny ones, so also all animals that can do so shift their habitat at 
<A NAME="609"></A>various seasons.
<A NAME="610"></A><BR><BR>Some creatures can make provision against change without stirring 
<A NAME="611"></A>from their ordinary haunts; others migrate, quitting Pontus and the cold 
<A NAME="612"></A>countries after the autumnal equinox to avoid the approaching winter, and 
<A NAME="613"></A>after the spring equinox migrating from warm lands to cool lands to avoid 
<A NAME="614"></A>the coming heat. In some cases they migrate from places near at hand, in 
<A NAME="615"></A>others they may be said to come from the ends of the world, as in the case 
<A NAME="616"></A>of the crane; for these birds migrate from the steppes of Scythia to the 
<A NAME="617"></A>marshlands south of Egypt where the Nile has its source. And it is here, 
<A NAME="618"></A>by the way, that they are said to fight with the pygmies; and the story 
<A NAME="619"></A>is not fabulous, but there is in reality a race of dwarfish men, and the 
<A NAME="620"></A>horses are little in proportion, and the men live in caves underground. 
<A NAME="621"></A>Pelicans also migrate, and fly from the Strymon to the Ister, and breed 
<A NAME="622"></A>on the banks of this river. They depart in flocks, and the birds in front 
<A NAME="623"></A>wait for those in the rear, owing to the fact that when the flock is passing 
<A NAME="624"></A>over the intervening mountain range, the birds in the rear lose sight of 
<A NAME="625"></A>their companions in the van.
<A NAME="626"></A><BR><BR>Fishes also in a similar manner shift their habitat now out of 
<A NAME="627"></A>the Euxine and now into it. In winter they move from the outer sea in towards 
<A NAME="628"></A>land in quest of heat; in summer they shift from shallow waters to the 
<A NAME="629"></A>deep sea to escape the heat.
<A NAME="630"></A><BR><BR>Weakly birds in winter and in frosty weather come down to the plains 
<A NAME="631"></A>for warmth, and in summer migrate to the hills for coolness. The more weakly 
<A NAME="632"></A>an animal is the greater hurry will it be in to migrate on account of extremes 
<A NAME="633"></A>of temperature, either hot or cold; thus the mackerel migrates in advance 
<A NAME="634"></A>of the tunnies, and the quail in advance of the cranes. The former migrates 
<A NAME="635"></A>in the month of Boedromion, and the latter in the month of Maemacterion. 
<A NAME="636"></A>All creatures are fatter in migrating from cold to heat than in migrating 
<A NAME="637"></A>from heat to cold; thus the quail is fatter when he emigrates in autumn 
<A NAME="638"></A>than when he arrives in spring. The migration from cold countries is contemporaneous 
<A NAME="639"></A>with the close of the hot season. Animals are in better trim for breeding 
<A NAME="640"></A>purposes in spring-time, when they change from hot to cool 
<A NAME="641"></A>lands.
<A NAME="642"></A><BR><BR>Of birds, the crane, as has been said, migrates from one end of 
<A NAME="643"></A>the world to the other; they fly against the wind. The story told about 
<A NAME="644"></A>the stone is untrue: to wit, that the bird, so the story goes, carries 
<A NAME="645"></A>in its inside a stone by way of ballast, and that the stone when vomited 
<A NAME="646"></A>up is a touchstone for gold.
<A NAME="647"></A><BR><BR>The cushat and the rock-dove migrate, and never winter in our country, 
<A NAME="648"></A>as is the case also with the turtle-dove; the common pigeon, however, stays 
<A NAME="649"></A>behind. The quail also migrates; only, by the way, a few quails and turtle-doves 
<A NAME="650"></A>may stay behind here and there in sunny districts. Cushats and turtle-doves 
<A NAME="651"></A>flock together, both when they arrive and when the season for migration 
<A NAME="652"></A>comes round again. When quails come to land, if it be fair weather or if 
<A NAME="653"></A>a north wind is blowing, they will pair off and manage pretty comfortably; 
<A NAME="654"></A>but if a southerly wind prevail they are greatly distressed owing to the 
<A NAME="655"></A>difficulties in the way of flight, for a southerly wind is wet and violent. 
<A NAME="656"></A>For this reason bird-catchers are never on the alert for these birds during 
<A NAME="657"></A>fine weather, but only during the prevalence of southerly winds, when the 
<A NAME="658"></A>bird from the violence of the wind is unable to fly. And, by the way, it 
<A NAME="659"></A>is owing to the distress occasioned by the bulkiness of its body that the 
<A NAME="660"></A>bird always screams while flying: for the labour is severe. When the quails 
<A NAME="661"></A>come from abroad they have no leaders, but when they migrate hence, the 
<A NAME="662"></A>glottis flits along with them, as does also the landrail, and the eared 
<A NAME="663"></A>owl, and the corncrake. The corncrake calls them in the night, and when 
<A NAME="664"></A>the birdcatchers hear the croak of the bird in the nighttime they know 
<A NAME="665"></A>that the quails are on the move. The landrail is like a marsh bird, and 
<A NAME="666"></A>the glottis has a tongue that can project far out of its beak. The eared 
<A NAME="667"></A>owl is like an ordinary owl, only that it has feathers about its ears; 
<A NAME="668"></A>by some it is called the night-raven. It is a great rogue of a bird, and 
<A NAME="669"></A>is a capital mimic; a bird-catcher will dance before it and, while the 
<A NAME="670"></A>bird is mimicking his gestures, the accomplice comes behind and catches 
<A NAME="671"></A>it. The common owl is caught by a similar trick.
<A NAME="672"></A><BR><BR>As a general rule all birds with crooked talons are short-necked, 
<A NAME="673"></A>flat-tongued, and disposed to mimicry. The Indian bird, the parrot, which 
<A NAME="674"></A>is said to have a man's tongue, answers to this description; and, by the 
<A NAME="675"></A>way, after drinking wine, the parrot becomes more saucy than 
<A NAME="676"></A>ever.
<A NAME="677"></A><BR><BR>Of birds, the following are migratory-the crane, the swan, the 
<A NAME="678"></A>pelican, and the lesser goose.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="679"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="680"></A><BR><BR>Of fishes, some, as has been observed, migrate from the outer seas 
<A NAME="681"></A>in towards shore, and from the shore towards the outer seas, to avoid the 
<A NAME="682"></A>extremes of cold and heat.
<A NAME="683"></A><BR><BR>Fish living near to the shore are better eating than deep-sea fish. 
<A NAME="684"></A>The fact is they have more abundant and better feeding, for wherever the 
<A NAME="685"></A>sun's heat can reach vegetation is more abundant, better in quality, and 
<A NAME="686"></A>more delicate, as is seen in any ordinary garden. Further, the black shore-weed 
<A NAME="687"></A>grows near to shore; the other shore-weed is like wild weed. Besides, the 
<A NAME="688"></A>parts of the sea near to shore are subjected to a more equable temperature; 
<A NAME="689"></A>and consequently the flesh of shallow-water fishes is firm and consistent, 
<A NAME="690"></A>whereas the flesh of deep-water fishes is flaccid and 
<A NAME="691"></A>watery.
<A NAME="692"></A><BR><BR>The following fishes are found near into the shore-the synodon, 
<A NAME="693"></A>the black bream, the merou, the gilthead, the mullet, the red mullet, the 
<A NAME="694"></A>wrasse, the weaver, the callionymus, the goby, and rock-fishes of all kinds. 
<A NAME="695"></A>The following are deep-sea fishes--the trygon, the cartilaginous fishes, 
<A NAME="696"></A>the white conger, the serranus, the erythrinus, and the glaucus. The braize, 
<A NAME="697"></A>the sea-scorpion, the black conger, the muraena, and the piper or sea-cuckoo 
<A NAME="698"></A>are found alike in shallow and deep waters. These fishes, however, vary 
<A NAME="699"></A>for various localities; for instance, the goby and all rock-fish are fat 
<A NAME="700"></A>off the coast of Crete. Again, the tunny is out of season in summer, when 
<A NAME="701"></A>it is being preyed on by its own peculiar louse-parasite, but after the 
<A NAME="702"></A>rising of Arcturus, when the parasite has left it, it comes into season 
<A NAME="703"></A>again. A number of fish also are found in sea-estuaries; such as the saupe, 
<A NAME="704"></A>the gilthead, the red mullet, and, in point of fact, the greater part of 
<A NAME="705"></A>the gregarious fishes. The bonito also is found in such waters, as, for 
<A NAME="706"></A>instance, off the coast of Alopeconnesus; and most species of fishes are 
<A NAME="707"></A>found in Lake Bistonis. The coly-mackerel as a rule does not enter the 
<A NAME="708"></A>Euxine, but passes the summer in the Propontis, where it spawns, and winters 
<A NAME="709"></A>in the Aegean. The tunny proper, the pelamys, and the bonito penetrate 
<A NAME="710"></A>into the Euxine in summer and pass the summer there; as do also the greater 
<A NAME="711"></A>part of such fish as swim in shoals with the currents, or congregate in 
<A NAME="712"></A>shoals together. And most fish congregate in shoals, and shoal-fishes in 
<A NAME="713"></A>all cases have leaders.
<A NAME="714"></A><BR><BR>Fish penetrate into the Euxine for two reasons, and firstly for 
<A NAME="715"></A>food. For the feeding is more abundant and better in quality owing to the 
<A NAME="716"></A>amount of fresh river-water that discharges into the sea, and moreover, 
<A NAME="717"></A>the large fishes of this inland sea are smaller than the large fishes of 
<A NAME="718"></A>the outer sea. In point of fact, there is no large fish in the Euxine excepting 
<A NAME="719"></A>the dolphin and the porpoise, and the dolphin is a small variety; but as 
<A NAME="720"></A>soon as you get into the outer sea the big fishes are on the big scale. 
<A NAME="721"></A>Furthermore, fish penetrate into this sea for the purpose of breeding; 
<A NAME="722"></A>for there are recesses there favourable for spawning, and the fresh and 
<A NAME="723"></A>exceptionally sweet water has an invigorating effect upon the spawn. After 
<A NAME="724"></A>spawning, when the young fishes have attained some size, the parent fish 
<A NAME="725"></A>swim out of the Euxine immediately after the rising of the Pleiads. If 
<A NAME="726"></A>winter comes in with a southerly wind, they swim out with more or less 
<A NAME="727"></A>of deliberation; but, if a north wind be blowing, they swim out with greater 
<A NAME="728"></A>rapidity, from the fact that the breeze is favourable to their own course. 
<A NAME="729"></A>And, by the way, the young fish are caught about this time in the neighbourhood 
<A NAME="730"></A>of Byzantium very small in size, as might have been expected from the shortness 
<A NAME="731"></A>of their sojourn in the Euxine. The shoals in general are visible both 
<A NAME="732"></A>as they quit and enter the Euxine. The trichiae, however, only can be caught 
<A NAME="733"></A>during their entry, but are never visible during their exit; in point of 
<A NAME="734"></A>fact, when a trichia is caught running outwards in the neighbourhood of 
<A NAME="735"></A>Byzantium, the fishermen are particularly careful to cleanse their nets, 
<A NAME="736"></A>as the circumstance is so singular and exceptional. The way of accounting 
<A NAME="737"></A>for this phenomenon is that this fish, and this one only, swims northwards 
<A NAME="738"></A>into the Danube, and then at the point of its bifurcation swims down southwards 
<A NAME="739"></A>into the Adriatic. And, as a proof that this theory is correct, the very 
<A NAME="740"></A>opposite phenomenon presents itself in the Adriatic; that is to say, they 
<A NAME="741"></A>are not caught in that sea during their entry, but are caught during their 
<A NAME="742"></A>exit.
<A NAME="743"></A><BR><BR>Tunny-fish swim into the Euxine keeping the shore on their right, 
<A NAME="744"></A>and swim out of it with the shore upon their left. It is stated that they 
<A NAME="745"></A>do so as being naturally weak-sighted, and seeing better with the right 
<A NAME="746"></A>eye.
<A NAME="747"></A><BR><BR>During the daytime shoal-fish continue on their way, but during 
<A NAME="748"></A>the night they rest and feed. But if there be moonlight, they continue 
<A NAME="749"></A>their journey without resting at all. Some people accustomed to sea-life 
<A NAME="750"></A>assert that shoal-fish at the period of the winter solstice never move 
<A NAME="751"></A>at all, but keep perfectly still wherever they may happen to have been 
<A NAME="752"></A>overtaken by the solstice, and this lasts until the 
<A NAME="753"></A>equinox.
<A NAME="754"></A><BR><BR>The coly-mackerel is caught more frequently on entering than on 
<A NAME="755"></A>quitting the Euxine. And in the Propontis the fish is at its best before 
<A NAME="756"></A>the spawning season. Shoal-fish, as a rule, are caught in greater quantities 
<A NAME="757"></A>as they leave the Euxine, and at that season they are in the best condition. 
<A NAME="758"></A>At the time of their entrance they are caught in very plump condition close 
<A NAME="759"></A>to shore, but those are in comparatively poor condition that are caught 
<A NAME="760"></A>farther out to sea. Very often, when the coly-mackerel and the mackerel 
<A NAME="761"></A>are met by a south wind in their exit, there are better catches to the 
<A NAME="762"></A>southward than in the neighbourhood of Byzantium. So much then for the 
<A NAME="763"></A>phenomenon of migration of fishes.
<A NAME="764"></A><BR><BR>Now the same phenomenon is observed in fishes as in terrestrial 
<A NAME="765"></A>animals in regard to hibernation: in other words, during winter fishes 
<A NAME="766"></A>take to concealing themselves in out of the way places, and quit their 
<A NAME="767"></A>places of concealment in the warmer season. But, by the way, animals go 
<A NAME="768"></A>into concealment by way of refuge against extreme heat, as well as against 
<A NAME="769"></A>extreme cold. Sometimes an entire genus will thus seek concealment; in 
<A NAME="770"></A>other cases some species will do so and others will not. For instance, 
<A NAME="771"></A>the shell-fish seek concealment without exception, as is seen in the case 
<A NAME="772"></A>of those dwelling in the sea, the purple murex, the ceryx, and all such 
<A NAME="773"></A>like; but though in the case of the detached species the phenomenon is 
<A NAME="774"></A>obvious-for they hide themselves, as is seen in the scallop, or they are 
<A NAME="775"></A>provided with an operculum on the free surface, as in the case of land 
<A NAME="776"></A>snails-in the case of the non-detached the concealment is not so clearly 
<A NAME="777"></A>observed. They do not go into hiding at one and the same season; but the 
<A NAME="778"></A>snails go in winter, the purple murex and the ceryx for about thirty days 
<A NAME="779"></A>at the rising of the Dog-star, and the scallop at about the same period. 
<A NAME="780"></A>But for the most part they go into concealment when the weather is either 
<A NAME="781"></A>extremely cold or extremely hot.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="782"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="783"></A><BR><BR>Insects almost all go into hiding, with the exception of such of 
<A NAME="784"></A>them as live in human habitations or perish before the completion of the 
<A NAME="785"></A>year. They hide in the winter; some of them for several days, others for 
<A NAME="786"></A>only the coldest days, as the bee. For the bee also goes into hiding: and 
<A NAME="787"></A>the proof that it does so is that during a certain period bees never touch 
<A NAME="788"></A>the food set before them, and if a bee creeps out of the hive, it is quite 
<A NAME="789"></A>transparent, with nothing whatsoever in its stomach; and the period of 
<A NAME="790"></A>its rest and hiding lasts from the setting of the Pleiads until 
<A NAME="791"></A>springtime.
<A NAME="792"></A><BR><BR>Animals take their winter-sleep or summer-sleep by concealing themselves 
<A NAME="793"></A>in warm places, or in places where they have been used to lie 
<A NAME="794"></A>concealed.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="795"></A><B>Part 15</B>

<A NAME="796"></A><BR><BR>Several blooded animals take this sleep, such as the pholidotes 
<A NAME="797"></A>or tessellates, namely, the serpent, the lizard, the gecko, and the river. 
<A NAME="798"></A>crocodile, all of which go into hiding for four months in the depth of 
<A NAME="799"></A>winter, and during that time eat nothing. Serpents in general burrow under 
<A NAME="800"></A>ground for this purpose; the viper conceals itself under a 
<A NAME="801"></A>stone.
<A NAME="802"></A><BR><BR>A great number of fishes also take this sleep, and notably, the 
<A NAME="803"></A>hippurus and coracinus in winter time; for, whereas fish in general may 
<A NAME="804"></A>be caught at all periods of the year more or less, there is this singularity 
<A NAME="805"></A>observed in these fishes, that they are caught within a certain fixed period 
<A NAME="806"></A>of the year, and never by any chance out of it. The muraena also hides, 
<A NAME="807"></A>and the orphus or sea-perch, and the conger. Rock-fish pair off, male and 
<A NAME="808"></A>female, for hiding (just as for breeding); as is observed in the case of 
<A NAME="809"></A>the species of wrasse called the thrush and the owzel, and in the 
<A NAME="810"></A>perch.
<A NAME="811"></A><BR><BR>The tunny also takes a sleep in winter in deep waters, and gets 
<A NAME="812"></A>exceedingly fat after the sleep. The fishing season for the tunny begins 
<A NAME="813"></A>at the rising of the Pleiads and lasts, at the longest, down to the setting 
<A NAME="814"></A>of Arcturus; during the rest of the year they are hid and enjoying immunity. 
<A NAME="815"></A>About the time of hibernation a few tunnies or other hibernating fishes 
<A NAME="816"></A>are caught while swimming about, in particularly warm localities and in 
<A NAME="817"></A>exceptionally fine weather, or on nights of full moon; for the fishes are 
<A NAME="818"></A>induced (by the warmth or the light) to emerge for a while from their lair 
<A NAME="819"></A>in quest of food.
<A NAME="820"></A><BR><BR>Most fishes are at their best for the table during the summer or 
<A NAME="821"></A>winter sleep.
<A NAME="822"></A><BR><BR>The primas-tunny conceals itself in the mud; this may be inferred 
<A NAME="823"></A>from the fact that during a particular period the fish is never caught, 
<A NAME="824"></A>and that, when it is caught after that period, it is covered with mud and 
<A NAME="825"></A>has its fins damaged. In the spring these tunnies get in motion and proceed 
<A NAME="826"></A>towards the coast, coupling and breeding, and the females are now caught 
<A NAME="827"></A>full of spawn. At this time they are considered as in season, but in autumn 
<A NAME="828"></A>and in winter as of inferior quality; at this time also the males are full 
<A NAME="829"></A>of milt. When the spawn is small, the fish is hard to catch, but it is 
<A NAME="830"></A>easily caught when the spawn gets large, as the fish is then infested by 
<A NAME="831"></A>its parasite. Some fish burrow for sleep in the sand and some in mud, just 
<A NAME="832"></A>keeping their mouths outside.
<A NAME="833"></A><BR><BR>Most fishes hide, then, during the winter only, but crustaceans, 
<A NAME="834"></A>the rock-fish, the ray, and the cartilaginous species hide only during 
<A NAME="835"></A>extremely severe weather, and this may be inferred from the fact that these 
<A NAME="836"></A>fishes are never by any chance caught when the weather is extremely cold. 
<A NAME="837"></A>Some fishes, however, hide during the summer, as the glaucus or grey-back; 
<A NAME="838"></A>this fish hides in summer for about sixty days. The hake also and the gilthead 
<A NAME="839"></A>hide; and we infer that the hake hides over a lengthened period from the 
<A NAME="840"></A>fact that it is only caught at long intervals. We are led also to infer 
<A NAME="841"></A>that fishes hide in summer from the circumstance that the takes of certain 
<A NAME="842"></A>fish are made between the rise and setting of certain constellations: of 
<A NAME="843"></A>the Dog-star in particular, the sea at this period being upturned from 
<A NAME="844"></A>the lower depths. This phenomenon may be observed to best advantage in 
<A NAME="845"></A>the Bosporus; for the mud is there brought up to the surface and the fish 
<A NAME="846"></A>are brought up along with it. They say also that very often, when the sea-bottom 
<A NAME="847"></A>is dredged, more fish will be caught by the second haul than by the first 
<A NAME="848"></A>one. Furthermore, after very heavy rains numerous specimens become visible 
<A NAME="849"></A>of creatures that at other times are never seen at all or seen only at 
<A NAME="850"></A>intervals.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="851"></A><B>Part 16</B>

<A NAME="852"></A><BR><BR>A great number of birds also go into hiding; they do not all migrate, 
<A NAME="853"></A>as is generally supposed, to warmer countries. Thus, certain birds (as 
<A NAME="854"></A>the kite and the swallow) when they are not far off from places of this 
<A NAME="855"></A>kind, in which they have their permanent abode, betake themselves thither; 
<A NAME="856"></A>others, that are at a distance from such places, decline the trouble of 
<A NAME="857"></A>migration and simply hide themselves where they are. Swallows, for instance, 
<A NAME="858"></A>have been often found in holes, quite denuded of their feathers, and the 
<A NAME="859"></A>kite on its first emergence from torpidity has been seen to fly from out 
<A NAME="860"></A>some such hiding-place. And with regard to this phenomenon of periodic 
<A NAME="861"></A>torpor there is no distinction observed, whether the talons of a bird be 
<A NAME="862"></A>crooked or straight; for instance, the stork, the owzel, the turtle-dove, 
<A NAME="863"></A>and the lark, all go into hiding. The case of the turtledove is the most 
<A NAME="864"></A>notorious of all, for we would defy any one to assert that he had anywhere 
<A NAME="865"></A>seen a turtle-dove in winter-time; at the beginning of the hiding time 
<A NAME="866"></A>it is exceedingly plump, and during this period it moults, but retains 
<A NAME="867"></A>its plumpness. Some cushats hide; others, instead of hiding, migrate at 
<A NAME="868"></A>the same time as the swallow. The thrush and the starling hide; and of 
<A NAME="869"></A>birds with crooked talons the kite and the owl hide for a few 
<A NAME="870"></A>days.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="871"></A><B>Part 17</B>

<A NAME="872"></A><BR><BR>Of viviparous quadrupeds the porcupine and the bear retire into 
<A NAME="873"></A>concealment. The fact that the bear hides is well established, but there 
<A NAME="874"></A>are doubts as to its motive for so doing, whether it be by reason of the 
<A NAME="875"></A>cold or from some other cause. About this period the male and the female 
<A NAME="876"></A>become so fat as to be hardly capable of motion. The female brings forth 
<A NAME="877"></A>her young at this time, and remains in concealment until it is time to 
<A NAME="878"></A>bring the cubs out; and she brings them out in spring, about three months 
<A NAME="879"></A>after the winter solstice. The bear hides for at least forty days; during 
<A NAME="880"></A>fourteen of these days it is said not to move at all, but during most of 
<A NAME="881"></A>the subsequent days it moves, and from time to time wakes up. A she-bear 
<A NAME="882"></A>in pregnancy has either never been caught at all or has been caught very 
<A NAME="883"></A>seldom. There can be no doubt but that during this period they eat nothing; 
<A NAME="884"></A>for in the first place they never emerge from their hiding-place, and further, 
<A NAME="885"></A>when they are caught, their belly and intestines are found to be quite 
<A NAME="886"></A>empty. It is also said that from no food being taken the gut almost closes 
<A NAME="887"></A>up, and that in consequence the animal on first emerging takes to eating 
<A NAME="888"></A>arum with the view of opening up and distending the 
<A NAME="889"></A>gut.
<A NAME="890"></A><BR><BR>The dormouse actually hides in a tree, and gets very fat at that 
<A NAME="891"></A>period; as does also the white mouse of Pontus.
<A NAME="892"></A><BR><BR>(Of animals that hide or go torpid some slough off what is called 
<A NAME="893"></A>their 'old-age'. This name is applied to the outermost skin, and to the 
<A NAME="894"></A>casing that envelops the developing organism.)
<A NAME="895"></A><BR><BR>In discussing the case of terrestrial vivipara we stated that the 
<A NAME="896"></A>reason for the bear's seeking concealment is an open question. We now proceed 
<A NAME="897"></A>to treat of the tessellates. The tessellates for the most part go into 
<A NAME="898"></A>hiding, and if their skin is soft they slough off their 'old-age', but 
<A NAME="899"></A>not if the skin is shell-like, as is the shell of the tortoise-for, by 
<A NAME="900"></A>the way, the tortoise and the fresh water tortoise belong to the tessellates. 
<A NAME="901"></A>Thus, the old-age is sloughed off by the gecko, the lizard, and above all, 
<A NAME="902"></A>by serpents; and they slough off the skin in springtime when emerging from 
<A NAME="903"></A>their torpor, and again in the autumn. Vipers also slough off their skin 
<A NAME="904"></A>both in spring and in autumn, and it is not the case, as some aver, that 
<A NAME="905"></A>this species of the serpent family is exceptional in not sloughing. When 
<A NAME="906"></A>the serpent begins to slough, the skin peels off at first from the eyes, 
<A NAME="907"></A>so that any one ignorant of the phenomenon would suppose the animal were 
<A NAME="908"></A>going blind; after that it peels off the head, and so on, until the creature 
<A NAME="909"></A>presents to view only a white surface all over. The sloughing goes on for 
<A NAME="910"></A>a day and a night, beginning with the head and ending with the tail. During 
<A NAME="911"></A>the sloughing of the skin an inner layer comes to the surface, for the 
<A NAME="912"></A>creature emerges just as the embryo from its afterbirth.
<A NAME="913"></A><BR><BR>All insects that slough at all slough in the same way; as the silphe, 
<A NAME="914"></A>and the empis or midge, and all the coleoptera, as for instance the cantharus-beetle. 
<A NAME="915"></A>They all slough after the period of development; for just as the afterbirth 
<A NAME="916"></A>breaks from off the young of the vivipara so the outer husk breaks off 
<A NAME="917"></A>from around the young of the vermipara, in the same way both with the bee 
<A NAME="918"></A>and the grasshopper. The cicada the moment after issuing from the husk 
<A NAME="919"></A>goes and sits upon an olive tree or a reed; after the breaking up of the 
<A NAME="920"></A>husk the creature issues out, leaving a little moisture behind, and after 
<A NAME="921"></A>a short interval flies up into the air and sets a. chirping.
<A NAME="922"></A><BR><BR>Of marine animals the crawfish and the lobster slough sometimes 
<A NAME="923"></A>in the spring, and sometimes in autumn after parturition. Lobsters have 
<A NAME="924"></A>been caught occasionally with the parts about the thorax soft, from the 
<A NAME="925"></A>shell having there peeled off, and the lower parts hard, from the shell 
<A NAME="926"></A>having not yet peeled off there; for, by the way, they do not slough in 
<A NAME="927"></A>the same manner as the serpent. The crawfish hides for about five months. 
<A NAME="928"></A>Crabs also slough off their old-age; this is generally allowed with regard 
<A NAME="929"></A>to the soft-shelled crabs, and it is said to be the case with the testaceous 
<A NAME="930"></A>kind, as for instance with the large 'granny' crab. When these animals 
<A NAME="931"></A>slough their shell becomes soft all over, and as for the crab, it can scarcely 
<A NAME="932"></A>crawl. These animals also do not cast their skins once and for all, but 
<A NAME="933"></A>over and over again.
<A NAME="934"></A><BR><BR>So much for the animals that go into hiding or torpidity, for the 
<A NAME="935"></A>times at which, and the ways in which, they go; and so much also for the 
<A NAME="936"></A>animals that slough off their old-age, and for the times at which they 
<A NAME="937"></A>undergo the process.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="938"></A><B>Part 18</B>

<A NAME="939"></A><BR><BR>Animals do not all thrive at the same seasons, nor do they thrive 
<A NAME="940"></A>alike during all extremes of weather. Further animals of diverse species 
<A NAME="941"></A>are in a diverse way healthy or sickly at certain seasons; and, in point 
<A NAME="942"></A>of fact, some animals have ailments that are unknown to others. Birds thrive 
<A NAME="943"></A>in times of drought, both in their general health and in regard to parturition, 
<A NAME="944"></A>and this is especially the case with the cushat; fishes, however, with 
<A NAME="945"></A>a few exceptions, thrive best in rainy weather; on the contrary rainy seasons 
<A NAME="946"></A>are bad for birds-and so by the way is much drinking-and drought is bad 
<A NAME="947"></A>for fishes. Birds of prey, as has been already stated, may in a general 
<A NAME="948"></A>way be said never to drink at all, though Hesiod appears to have been ignorant 
<A NAME="949"></A>of the fact, for in his story about the siege of Ninus he represents the 
<A NAME="950"></A>eagle that presided over the auguries as in the act of drinking; all other 
<A NAME="951"></A>birds drink, but drink sparingly, as is the case also with all other spongy-lunged 
<A NAME="952"></A>oviparous animals. Sickness in birds may be diagnosed from their plumage, 
<A NAME="953"></A>which is ruffled when they are sickly instead of lying smooth as when they 
<A NAME="954"></A>are well.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="955"></A><B>Part 19</B>

<A NAME="956"></A><BR><BR>The majority of fishes, as has been stated, thrive best in rainy 
<A NAME="957"></A>seasons. Not only have they food in greater abundance at this time, but 
<A NAME="958"></A>in a general way rain is wholesome for them just as it is for vegetation-for, 
<A NAME="959"></A>by the way, kitchen vegetables, though artificially watered, derive benefit 
<A NAME="960"></A>from rain; and the same remark applies even to reeds that grow in marshes, 
<A NAME="961"></A>as they hardly grow at all without a rainfall. That rain is good for fishes 
<A NAME="962"></A>may be inferred from the fact that most fishes migrate to the Euxine for 
<A NAME="963"></A>the summer; for owing to the number of the rivers that discharge into this 
<A NAME="964"></A>sea its water is exceptionally fresh, and the rivers bring down a large 
<A NAME="965"></A>supply of food. Besides, a great number of fishes, such as the bonito and 
<A NAME="966"></A>the mullet, swim up the rivers and thrive in the rivers and marshes. The 
<A NAME="967"></A>sea-gudgeon also fattens in the rivers, and, as a rule, countries abounding 
<A NAME="968"></A>in lagoons furnish unusually excellent fish. While most fishes, then, are 
<A NAME="969"></A>benefited by rain, they are chiefly benefited by summer rain; or we may 
<A NAME="970"></A>state the case thus, that rain is good for fishes in spring, summer, and 
<A NAME="971"></A>autumn, and fine dry weather in winter. As a general rule what is good 
<A NAME="972"></A>for men is good for fishes also.
<A NAME="973"></A><BR><BR>Fishes do not thrive in cold places, and those fishes suffer most 
<A NAME="974"></A>in severe winters that have a stone in their head, as the chromis, the 
<A NAME="975"></A>basse, the sciaena, and the braize; for owing to the stone they get frozen 
<A NAME="976"></A>with the cold, and are thrown up on shore.
<A NAME="977"></A><BR><BR>Whilst rain is wholesome for most fishes, it is, on the contrary, 
<A NAME="978"></A>unwholesome for the mullet, the cephalus, and the so-called marinus, for 
<A NAME="979"></A>rain superinduces blindness in most of these fishes, and all the more rapidly 
<A NAME="980"></A>if the rainfall be superabundant. The cephalus is peculiarly subject to 
<A NAME="981"></A>this malady in severe winters; their eyes grow white, and when caught they 
<A NAME="982"></A>are in poor condition, and eventually the disease kills them. It would 
<A NAME="983"></A>appear that this disease is due to extreme cold even more than to an excessive 
<A NAME="984"></A>rainfall; for instance, in many places and more especially in shallows 
<A NAME="985"></A>off the coast of Nauplia, in the Argolid, a number of fishes have been 
<A NAME="986"></A>known to be caught out at sea in seasons of severe cold. The gilthead also 
<A NAME="987"></A>suffers in winter; the acharnas suffers in summer, and loses condition. 
<A NAME="988"></A>The coracine is exceptional among fishes in deriving benefit from drought, 
<A NAME="989"></A>and this is due to the fact that heat and drought are apt to come 
<A NAME="990"></A>together.
<A NAME="991"></A><BR><BR>Particular places suit particular fishes; some are naturally fishes 
<A NAME="992"></A>of the shore, and some of the deep sea, and some are at home in one or 
<A NAME="993"></A>the other of these regions, and others are common to the two and are at 
<A NAME="994"></A>home in both. Some fishes will thrive in one particular spot, and in that 
<A NAME="995"></A>spot only. As a general rule it may be said that places abounding in weeds 
<A NAME="996"></A>are wholesome; at all events, fishes caught in such places are exceptionally 
<A NAME="997"></A>fat: that is, such fishes a a habit all sorts of localities as well. The 
<A NAME="998"></A>fact is that weed-eating fishes find abundance of their special food in 
<A NAME="999"></A>such localities, and carnivorous fish find an unusually large number of 
<A NAME="1000"></A>smaller fish. It matters also whether the wind be from the north or south: 
<A NAME="1001"></A>the longer fish thrive better when a north wind prevails, and in summer 
<A NAME="1002"></A>at one and the same spot more long fish will be caught than flat fish with 
<A NAME="1003"></A>a north wind blowing.
<A NAME="1004"></A><BR><BR>The tunny and the sword-fish are infested with a parasite about 
<A NAME="1005"></A>the rising of the Dog-star; that is to say, about this time both these 
<A NAME="1006"></A>fishes have a grub beside their fins that is nicknamed the 'gadfly'. It 
<A NAME="1007"></A>resembles the scorpion in shape, and is about the size of the spider. So 
<A NAME="1008"></A>acute is the pain it inflicts that the sword-fish will often leap as high 
<A NAME="1009"></A>out of the water as a dolphin; in fact, it sometimes leaps over the bulwarks 
<A NAME="1010"></A>of a vessel and falls back on the deck. The tunny delights more than any 
<A NAME="1011"></A>other fish in the heat of the sun. It will burrow for warmth in the sand 
<A NAME="1012"></A>in shallow waters near to shore, or will, because it is warm, disport itself 
<A NAME="1013"></A>on the surface of the sea.
<A NAME="1014"></A><BR><BR>The fry of little fishes escape by being overlooked, for it is 
<A NAME="1015"></A>only the larger ones of the small species that fishes of the large species 
<A NAME="1016"></A>will pursue. The greater part of the spawn and the fry of fishes is destroyed 
<A NAME="1017"></A>by the heat of the sun, for whatever of them the sun reaches it 
<A NAME="1018"></A>spoils.
<A NAME="1019"></A><BR><BR>Fishes are caught in greatest abundance before sunrise and after 
<A NAME="1020"></A>sunset, or, speaking generally, just about sunset and sunrise. Fishermen 
<A NAME="1021"></A>haul up their nets at these times, and speak of the hauls then made as 
<A NAME="1022"></A>the 'nick-of-time' hauls. The fact is, that at these times fishes are particularly 
<A NAME="1023"></A>weak-sighted; at night they are at rest, and as the light grows stronger 
<A NAME="1024"></A>they see comparatively well.
<A NAME="1025"></A><BR><BR>We know of no pestilential malady attacking fishes, such as those 
<A NAME="1026"></A>which attack man, and horses and oxen among the quadrupedal vivipara, and 
<A NAME="1027"></A>certain species of other genera, domesticated and wild; but fishes do seem 
<A NAME="1028"></A>to suffer from sickness; and fishermen infer this from the fact that at 
<A NAME="1029"></A>times fishes in poor condition, and looking as though they were sick, and 
<A NAME="1030"></A>of altered colour, are caught in a large haul of well-conditioned fish 
<A NAME="1031"></A>of their own species. So much for sea-fishes.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1032"></A><B>Part 20</B>

<A NAME="1033"></A><BR><BR>River-fish and lake-fish also are exempt from diseases of a pestilential 
<A NAME="1034"></A>character, but certain species are subject to special and peculiar maladies. 
<A NAME="1035"></A>For instance, the sheat-fish just before the rising of the Dog-star, owing 
<A NAME="1036"></A>to its swimming near the surface of the water, is liable to sunstroke, 
<A NAME="1037"></A>and is paralysed by a loud peal of thunder. The carp is subject to the 
<A NAME="1038"></A>same eventualities  but in a lesser degree. The sheatfish is destroyed 
<A NAME="1039"></A>in great quantities in shallow waters by the serpent called the dragon. 
<A NAME="1040"></A>In the balerus and tilon a worm is engendered about the rising of the Dog-star, 
<A NAME="1041"></A>that sickens these fish and causes them to rise towards the surface, where 
<A NAME="1042"></A>they are killed by the excessive heat. The chalcis is subject to a very 
<A NAME="1043"></A>violent malady; lice are engendered underneath their gills in great numbers, 
<A NAME="1044"></A>and cause destruction among them; but no other species of fish is subject 
<A NAME="1045"></A>to any such malady.
<A NAME="1046"></A><BR><BR>If mullein be introduced into water it will kill fish in its vicinity. 
<A NAME="1047"></A>It is used extensively for catching fish in rivers and ponds; by the Phoenicians 
<A NAME="1048"></A>it is made use of also in the sea.
<A NAME="1049"></A><BR><BR>There are two other methods employed for catch-fish. It is a known 
<A NAME="1050"></A>fact that in winter fishes emerge from the deep parts of rivers and, by 
<A NAME="1051"></A>the way, at all seasons fresh water is tolerably cold. A trench accordingly 
<A NAME="1052"></A>is dug leading into a river, and wattled at the river end with reeds and 
<A NAME="1053"></A>stones, an aperture being left in the wattling through which the river 
<A NAME="1054"></A>water flows into the trench; when the frost comes on the fish can be taken 
<A NAME="1055"></A>out of the trench in weels. Another method is adopted in summer and winter 
<A NAME="1056"></A>alike. They run across a stream a dam composed of brushwood and stones 
<A NAME="1057"></A>leaving a small open space, and in this space they insert a weel; they 
<A NAME="1058"></A>then coop the fish in towards this place, and draw them up in the weel 
<A NAME="1059"></A>as they swim through the open space.
<A NAME="1060"></A><BR><BR>Shell-fish, as a rule, are benefited by rainy weather. The purple 
<A NAME="1061"></A>murex is an exception; if it be placed on a shore near to where a river 
<A NAME="1062"></A>discharges, it will die within a day after tasting the fresh water. The 
<A NAME="1063"></A>murex lives for about fifty days after capture; during this period they 
<A NAME="1064"></A>feed off one another, as there grows on the shell a kind of sea-weed or 
<A NAME="1065"></A>sea-moss; if any food is thrown to them during this period, it is said 
<A NAME="1066"></A>to be done not to keep them alive, but to make them weigh 
<A NAME="1067"></A>more.
<A NAME="1068"></A><BR><BR>To shell-fish in general drought is unwholesome. During dry weather 
<A NAME="1069"></A>they decrease in size and degenerate in quality; and it is during such 
<A NAME="1070"></A>weather that the red scallop is found in more than usual abundance. In 
<A NAME="1071"></A>the Pyrrhaean Strait the clam was exterminated, partly by the dredging-machine 
<A NAME="1072"></A>used in their capture, and partly by long-continued droughts. Rainy weather 
<A NAME="1073"></A>is wholesome to the generality of shellfish owing to the fact that the 
<A NAME="1074"></A>sea-water then becomes exceptionally sweet. In the Euxine, owing to the 
<A NAME="1075"></A>coldness of the climate, shellfish are not found: nor yet in rivers, excepting 
<A NAME="1076"></A>a few bivalves here and there. Univalves, by the way, are very apt to freeze 
<A NAME="1077"></A>to death in extremely cold weather. So much for animals that live in 
<A NAME="1078"></A>water.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="1079"></A><B>Part 21</B>

<A NAME="1080"></A><BR><BR>To turn to quadrupeds, the pig suffers from three diseases, one 
<A NAME="1081"></A>of which is called branchos, a disease attended with swellings about the 
<A NAME="1082"></A>windpipe and the jaws. It may break out in any part of the body; very often 
<A NAME="1083"></A>it attacks the foot, and occasionally the ear; the neighbouring parts also 
<A NAME="1084"></A>soon rot, and the decay goes on until it reaches the lungs, when the animal 
<A NAME="1085"></A>succumbs. The disease develops with great rapidity, and the moment it sets 
<A NAME="1086"></A>in the animal gives up eating. The swineherds know but one way to cure 
<A NAME="1087"></A>it, namely, by complete excision, when they detect the first signs of the 
<A NAME="1088"></A>disease. There are two other diseases, which are both alike termed craurus. 
<A NAME="1089"></A>The one is attended with pain and heaviness in the head, and this is the 
<A NAME="1090"></A>commoner of the two, the other with diarrhoea. The latter is incurable, 
<A NAME="1091"></A>the former is treated by applying wine fomentations to the snout and rinsing 
<A NAME="1092"></A>the nostrils with wine. Even this disease is very hard to cure; it has 
<A NAME="1093"></A>been known to kill within three or four days. The animal is chiefly subject 
<A NAME="1094"></A>to branchos when it gets extremely fat, and when the heat has brought a 
<A NAME="1095"></A>good supply of figs. The treatment is to feed on mashed mulberries, to 
<A NAME="1096"></A>give repeated warm baths, and to lance the under part of the 
<A NAME="1097"></A>tongue.

<A NAME="1099"></A>and shoulders, for the pimples develop chiefly in these parts. If the pimples 
<A NAME="1100"></A>are few in number the flesh is comparatively sweet, but if they be numerous 
<A NAME="1101"></A>it gets watery and flaccid. The symptoms of measles are obvious, for the 
<A NAME="1102"></A>pimples show chiefly on the under side of the tongue, and if you pluck 
<A NAME="1103"></A>the bristles off the chine the skin will appear suffused with blood, and 
<A NAME="1104"></A>further the animal will be unable to keep its hind-feet at rest. Pigs never 
<A NAME="1105"></A>take this disease while they are mere sucklings. The pimples may be got 
<A NAME="1106"></A>rid of by feeding on this kind of spelt called tiphe; and this spelt, by 
<A NAME="1107"></A>the way, is very good for ordinary food. The best food for rearing and
