<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part XII</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>The parts of Tragedy which must be treated as elements of the whole have 
<A NAME="12"></A>been already mentioned. We now come to the quantitative parts- the separate 
<A NAME="13"></A>parts into which Tragedy is divided- namely, Prologue, Episode, Exode, 
<A NAME="14"></A>Choric song; this last being divided into Parode and Stasimon. These are 
<A NAME="15"></A>common to all plays: peculiar to some are the songs of actors from the 
<A NAME="16"></A>stage and the Commoi.
<A NAME="17"></A><BR><BR>The Prologue is that entire part of a tragedy which precedes the 
<A NAME="18"></A>Parode of the Chorus. The Episode is that entire part of a tragedy which 
<A NAME="19"></A>is between complete choric songs. The Exode is that entire part of a tragedy 
<A NAME="20"></A>which has no choric song after it. Of the Choric part the Parode is the 
<A NAME="21"></A>first undivided utterance of the Chorus: the Stasimon is a Choric ode without 
<A NAME="22"></A>anapaests or trochaic tetrameters: the Commos is a joint lamentation of 
<A NAME="23"></A>Chorus and actors. The parts of Tragedy which must be treated as elements 
<A NAME="24"></A>of the whole have been already mentioned. The quantitative parts- the separate 
<A NAME="25"></A>parts into which it is divided- are here enumerated.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="26"></A><B>Part XIII</B>

<A NAME="27"></A><BR><BR>As the sequel to what has already been said, we must proceed to 
<A NAME="28"></A>consider what the poet should aim at, and what he should avoid, in constructing 
<A NAME="29"></A>his plots; and by what means the specific effect of Tragedy will be 
<A NAME="30"></A>produced.
<A NAME="31"></A><BR><BR>A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the 
<A NAME="32"></A>simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which 
<A NAME="33"></A>excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. 
<A NAME="34"></A>It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented 
<A NAME="35"></A>must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to 
<A NAME="36"></A>adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us. Nor, 
<A NAME="37"></A>again, that of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity: for nothing 
<A NAME="38"></A>can be more alien to the spirit of Tragedy; it possesses no single tragic 
<A NAME="39"></A>quality; it neither satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear. 
<A NAME="40"></A>Nor, again, should the downfall of the utter villain be exhibited. A plot 
<A NAME="41"></A>of this kind would, doubtless, satisfy the moral sense, but it would inspire 
<A NAME="42"></A>neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear 
<A NAME="43"></A>by the misfortune of a man like ourselves. Such an event, therefore, will 
<A NAME="44"></A>be neither pitiful nor terrible. There remains, then, the character between 
<A NAME="45"></A>these two extremes- that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet 
<A NAME="46"></A>whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some 
<A NAME="47"></A>error or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous- 
<A NAME="48"></A>a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such 
<A NAME="49"></A>families.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, 
<A NAME="51"></A>rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not 
<A NAME="52"></A>from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about 
<A NAME="53"></A>as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character 
<A NAME="54"></A>either such as we have described, or better rather than worse. The practice 
<A NAME="55"></A>of the stage bears out our view. At first the poets recounted any legend 
<A NAME="56"></A>that came in their way. Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story 
<A NAME="57"></A>of a few houses- on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, 
<A NAME="58"></A>Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done  or suffered something 
<A NAME="59"></A>terrible. A tragedy, then, to be perfect according to the rules of art 
<A NAME="60"></A>should be of this construction. Hence they are in error who censure Euripides 
<A NAME="61"></A>just because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end 
<A NAME="62"></A>unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending. The best proof is 
<A NAME="63"></A>that on the stage and in dramatic competition, such plays, if well worked 
<A NAME="64"></A>out, are the most tragic in effect; and Euripides, faulty though he may 
<A NAME="65"></A>be in the general management of his subject, yet is felt to be the most 
<A NAME="66"></A>tragic of the poets.
<A NAME="67"></A><BR><BR>In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. 
<A NAME="68"></A>Like the Odyssey, it has a double thread of plot, and also an opposite 
<A NAME="69"></A>catastrophe for the good and for the bad. It is accounted the best because 
<A NAME="70"></A>of the weakness of the spectators; for the poet is guided in what he writes 
<A NAME="71"></A>by the wishes of his audience. The pleasure, however, thence derived is 
<A NAME="72"></A>not the true tragic pleasure. It is proper rather to Comedy, where those 
<A NAME="73"></A>who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies- like Orestes and Aegisthus- 
<A NAME="74"></A>quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is 
<A NAME="75"></A>slain.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="76"></A><B>Part XIV</B>

<A NAME="77"></A><BR><BR>Fear and pity may be aroused by spectacular means; but they may 
<A NAME="78"></A>also result from the inner structure of the piece, which is the better 
<A NAME="79"></A>way, and indicates a superior poet. For the plot ought to be so constructed 
<A NAME="80"></A>that, even without the aid of the eye, he who hears the tale told will 
<A NAME="81"></A>thrill with horror and melt to pity at what takes Place. This is the impression 
<A NAME="82"></A>we should receive from hearing the story of the Oedipus. But to produce 
<A NAME="83"></A>this effect by the mere spectacle is a less artistic method, and dependent 
<A NAME="84"></A>on extraneous aids. Those who employ spectacular means to create a sense 
<A NAME="85"></A>not of the terrible but only of the monstrous, are strangers to the purpose 
<A NAME="86"></A>of Tragedy; for we must not demand of Tragedy any and every kind of pleasure, 
<A NAME="87"></A>but only that which is proper to it. And since the pleasure which the poet 
<A NAME="88"></A>should afford is that which comes from pity and fear through imitation, 
<A NAME="89"></A>it is evident that this quality must be impressed upon the 
<A NAME="90"></A>incidents.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>Let us then determine what are the circumstances which strike us 
<A NAME="92"></A>as terrible or pitiful.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>Actions capable of this effect must happen between persons who 
<A NAME="94"></A>are either friends or enemies or indifferent to one another. If an enemy 
<A NAME="95"></A>kills an enemy, there is nothing to excite pity either in the act or the 
<A NAME="96"></A>intention- except so far as the suffering in itself is pitiful. So again 
<A NAME="97"></A>with indifferent persons. But when the tragic incident occurs between those 
<A NAME="98"></A>who are near or dear to one another- if, for example, a brother kills, 
<A NAME="99"></A>or intends to kill, a brother, a son his father, a mother her son, a son 
<A NAME="100"></A>his mother, or any other deed of the kind is done- these are the situations 
<A NAME="101"></A>to be looked for by the poet. He may not indeed destroy the framework of 
<A NAME="102"></A>the received legends- the fact, for instance, that Clytemnestra was slain 
<A NAME="103"></A>by Orestes and Eriphyle by Alcmaeon- but he ought to show of his own, and 
<A NAME="104"></A>skilfully handle the traditional. material. Let us explain more clearly 
<A NAME="105"></A>what is meant by skilful handling.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>The action may be done consciously and with knowledge of the persons, 
<A NAME="107"></A>in the manner of the older poets. It is thus too that Euripides makes Medea 
<A NAME="108"></A>slay her children. Or, again, the deed of horror may be done, but done 
<A NAME="109"></A> in ignorance, and the tie of kinship or friendship be discovered afterwards. 
<A NAME="110"></A>The Oedipus of Sophocles is an example. Here, indeed, the incident is outside 
<A NAME="111"></A>the drama proper; but cases occur where it falls within the action of the 
<A NAME="112"></A>play: one may cite the Alcmaeon of Astydamas, or Telegonus in the Wounded 
<A NAME="113"></A>Odysseus. Again, there is a third case- [to be about to act with knowledge 
<A NAME="114"></A>of the persons and then not to act. The fourth case] is when some one is 
<A NAME="115"></A>about to do an irreparable deed through ignorance, and makes the discovery 
<A NAME="116"></A>before it is done. These are the only possible ways. For the deed must 
<A NAME="117"></A>either be done  or not done- and that wittingly or unwittingly. But of 
<A NAME="118"></A>all these ways, to be about to act knowing the persons, and then not to 
<A NAME="119"></A>act, is the worst. It is shocking without being tragic, for no disaster 
<A NAME="120"></A>follows It is, therefore, never, or very rarely, found in poetry. One instance, 
<A NAME="121"></A>however, is in the Antigone, where Haemon threatens to kill Creon. The 
<A NAME="122"></A>next and better way is that the deed should be perpetrated. Still better, 
<A NAME="123"></A>that it should be perpetrated in ignorance, and the discovery made afterwards. 
<A NAME="124"></A>There is then nothing to shock us, while the discovery produces a startling 
<A NAME="125"></A>effect. The last case is the best, as when in the Cresphontes Merope is 
<A NAME="126"></A>about to slay her son, but, recognizing who he is, spares his life. So 
<A NAME="127"></A>in the Iphigenia, the sister recognizes the brother just in time. Again 
<A NAME="128"></A>in the Helle, the son recognizes the mother when on the point of giving 
<A NAME="129"></A>her up. This, then, is why a few families only, as has been already observed, 
<A NAME="130"></A>furnish the subjects of tragedy. It was not art, but happy chance, that 
<A NAME="131"></A>led the poets in search of subjects to impress the tragic quality upon 
<A NAME="132"></A>their plots. They are compelled, therefore, to have recourse to those houses 
<A NAME="133"></A>whose history contains moving incidents like these.
<A NAME="134"></A><BR><BR>Enough has now been said concerning the structure of the incidents, 
<A NAME="135"></A>and the right kind of plot.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="136"></A><B>Part XV</B>

<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>In respect of Character there are four things to be aimed at. First, 
<A NAME="138"></A>and most important, it must be good. Now any speech or action that manifests 
<A NAME="139"></A>moral purpose of any kind will be expressive of character: the character 
<A NAME="140"></A>will be good if the purpose is good. This rule is relative to each class. 
<A NAME="141"></A>Even a woman may be good, and also a slave; though the woman may be said 
<A NAME="142"></A>to be an inferior being, and the slave quite worthless. The second thing 
<A NAME="143"></A>to aim at is propriety. There is a type of manly valor; but valor in a 
<A NAME="144"></A>woman, or unscrupulous cleverness is inappropriate. Thirdly, character 
<A NAME="145"></A>must be true to life: for this is a distinct thing from goodness and propriety, 
<A NAME="146"></A>as here described. The fourth point is consistency: for though the subject 
<A NAME="147"></A>of the imitation, who suggested the type, be inconsistent, still he must 
<A NAME="148"></A>be consistently inconsistent. As an example of motiveless degradation of 
<A NAME="149"></A>character, we have Menelaus in the Orestes; of character indecorous and 
<A NAME="150"></A>inappropriate, the lament of Odysseus in the Scylla, and the speech of 
<A NAME="151"></A>Melanippe; of inconsistency, the Iphigenia at Aulis- for Iphigenia the 
<A NAME="152"></A>suppliant in no way resembles her later self.
<A NAME="153"></A><BR><BR>As in the structure of the plot, so too in the portraiture of character, 
<A NAME="154"></A>the poet should always aim either at the necessary or the probable. Thus 
<A NAME="155"></A>a person of a given character should speak or act in a given way, by the 
<A NAME="156"></A>rule either of necessity or of probability; just as this event should follow 
<A NAME="157"></A>that by necessary or probable sequence. It is therefore evident that the 
<A NAME="158"></A>unraveling of the plot, no less than the complication, must arise out of 
<A NAME="159"></A>the plot itself, it must not be brought about by the Deus ex Machina- as 
<A NAME="160"></A>in the Medea, or in the return of the Greeks in the Iliad. The Deus ex 
<A NAME="161"></A>Machina should be employed only for events external to the drama- for antecedent 
<A NAME="162"></A>or subsequent events, which lie beyond the range of human knowledge, and 
<A NAME="163"></A>which require to be reported or foretold; for to the gods we ascribe the 
<A NAME="164"></A>power of seeing all things. Within the action there must be nothing irrational. 
<A NAME="165"></A>If the irrational cannot be excluded, it should be outside the scope of 
<A NAME="166"></A>the tragedy. Such is the irrational element the Oedipus of 
<A NAME="167"></A>Sophocles.
<A NAME="168"></A><BR><BR>Again, since Tragedy is an imitation of persons who are above the 
<A NAME="169"></A>common level, the example of good portrait painters should be followed. 
<A NAME="170"></A>They, while reproducing the distinctive form of the original, make a likeness 
<A NAME="171"></A>which is true to life and yet more beautiful. So too the poet, in representing 
<A NAME="172"></A>men who are irascible or indolent, or have other defects of character, 
<A NAME="173"></A>should preserve the type and yet ennoble it. In this way Achilles is portrayed 
<A NAME="174"></A>by Agathon and Homer.
<A NAME="175"></A><BR><BR>These then are rules the poet should observe. Nor should he neglect 
<A NAME="176"></A>those appeals to the senses, which, though not among the essentials, are 
<A NAME="177"></A>the concomitants of poetry; for here too there is much room for error. 
<A NAME="178"></A>But of this enough has been said in our published treatises.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="179"></A><B>Part XVI</B>

<A NAME="180"></A><BR><BR>What Recognition is has been already explained. We will now enumerate 
<A NAME="181"></A>its kinds.
<A NAME="182"></A><BR><BR>First, the least artistic form, which, from poverty of wit, is 
<A NAME="183"></A>most commonly employed- recognition by signs. Of these some are congenital- 
<A NAME="184"></A>such as 'the spear which the earth-born race bear on their bodies,' or 
<A NAME="185"></A>the stars introduced by Carcinus in his Thyestes. Others are acquired after 
<A NAME="186"></A>birth; and of these some are bodily marks, as scars; some external tokens, 
<A NAME="187"></A>as necklaces, or the little ark in the Tyro by which the discovery is effected. 
<A NAME="188"></A>Even these admit of more or less skilful treatment. Thus in the recognition 
<A NAME="189"></A>of Odysseus by his scar, the discovery is made in one way by the nurse, 
<A NAME="190"></A>in another by the swineherds. The use of tokens for the express purpose 
<A NAME="191"></A>of proof- and, indeed, any formal proof with or without tokens- is a less 
<A NAME="192"></A>artistic mode of recognition. A better kind is that which comes about by 
<A NAME="193"></A>a turn of incident, as in the Bath Scene in the Odyssey.
<A NAME="194"></A><BR><BR>Next come the recognitions invented at will by the poet, and on 
<A NAME="195"></A>that account wanting in art. For example, Orestes in the Iphigenia reveals 
<A NAME="196"></A>the fact that he is Orestes. She, indeed, makes herself known by the letter; 
<A NAME="197"></A>but he, by speaking himself, and saying what the poet, not what the plot 
<A NAME="198"></A>requires. This, therefore, is nearly allied to the fault above mentioned- 
<A NAME="199"></A>for Orestes might as well have brought tokens with him. Another similar 
<A NAME="200"></A>instance is the 'voice of the shuttle' in the Tereus of 
<A NAME="201"></A>Sophocles.
<A NAME="202"></A><BR><BR>The third kind depends on memory when the sight of some object 
<A NAME="203"></A>awakens a feeling: as in the Cyprians of Dicaeogenes, where the hero breaks 
<A NAME="204"></A>into tears on seeing the picture; or again in the Lay of Alcinous, where 
<A NAME="205"></A>Odysseus, hearing the minstrel play the lyre, recalls the past and weeps; 
<A NAME="206"></A>and hence the recognition.
<A NAME="207"></A><BR><BR>The fourth kind is by process of reasoning. Thus in the Choephori: 
<A NAME="208"></A>'Some one resembling me has come: no one resembles me but Orestes: therefore 
<A NAME="209"></A>Orestes has come.' Such too is the discovery made by Iphigenia in the play 
<A NAME="210"></A>of Polyidus the Sophist. It was a natural reflection for Orestes to make, 
<A NAME="211"></A>'So I too must die at the altar like my sister.' So, again, in the Tydeus 
<A NAME="212"></A>of Theodectes, the father says, 'I came to find my son, and I lose my own 
<A NAME="213"></A>life.' So too in the Phineidae: the women, on seeing the place, inferred 
<A NAME="214"></A>their fate- 'Here we are doomed to die, for here we were cast forth.' Again, 
<A NAME="215"></A>there is a composite kind of recognition involving false inference on the 
<A NAME="216"></A>part of one of the characters, as in the Odysseus Disguised as a Messenger. 
<A NAME="217"></A>A said [that no one else was able to bend the bow; ... hence B (the disguised 
<A NAME="218"></A>Odysseus) imagined that A would] recognize the bow which, in fact, he had 
<A NAME="219"></A>not seen; and to bring about a recognition by this means- the expectation 
<A NAME="220"></A>that A would recognize the bow- is false inference.
<A NAME="221"></A><BR><BR>But, of all recognitions, the best is that which arises from the 
<A NAME="222"></A>incidents themselves, where the startling discovery is made by natural 
<A NAME="223"></A>means. Such is that in the Oedipus of Sophocles, and in the Iphigenia; 
<A NAME="224"></A>for it was natural that Iphigenia should wish to dispatch a letter. These 
<A NAME="225"></A>recognitions alone dispense with the artificial aid of tokens or amulets. 
<A NAME="226"></A>Next come the recognitions by process of reasoning.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="227"></A><B>Part XVII</B>

<A NAME="228"></A><BR><BR>In constructing the plot and working it out with the proper diction, 
<A NAME="229"></A>the poet should place the scene, as far as possible, before his eyes. In 
<A NAME="230"></A>this way, seeing everything with the utmost vividness, as if he were a 
<A NAME="231"></A>spectator of the action, he will discover what is in keeping with it, and 
<A NAME="232"></A>be most unlikely to overlook inconsistencies. The need of such a rule is 
<A NAME="233"></A>shown by the fault found in Carcinus. Amphiaraus was on his way from the 
<A NAME="234"></A>temple. This fact escaped the observation of one who did not see the situation. 
<A NAME="235"></A>On the stage, however, the Piece failed, the audience being offended at 
<A NAME="236"></A>the oversight.
<A NAME="237"></A><BR><BR>Again, the poet should work out his play, to the best of his power, 
<A NAME="238"></A>with appropriate gestures; for those who feel emotion are most convincing 
<A NAME="239"></A>through natural sympathy with the characters they represent; and one who 
<A NAME="240"></A>is agitated storms, one who is angry rages, with the most lifelike reality. 
<A NAME="241"></A>Hence poetry implies either a happy gift of nature or a strain of madness. 
<A NAME="242"></A>In the one case a man can take the mould of any character; in the other, 
<A NAME="243"></A>he is lifted out of his proper self.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>As for the story, whether the poet takes it ready made or constructs 
<A NAME="245"></A>it for himself, he should first sketch its general outline, and then fill 
<A NAME="246"></A>in the episodes and amplify in detail. The general plan may be illustrated 
<A NAME="247"></A>by the Iphigenia. A young girl is sacrificed; she disappears mysteriously 
<A NAME="248"></A>from the eyes of those who sacrificed her; she is transported to another 
<A NAME="249"></A>country, where the custom is to offer up an strangers to the goddess. To 
<A NAME="250"></A>this ministry she is appointed. Some time later her own brother chances 
<A NAME="251"></A>to arrive. The fact that the oracle for some reason ordered him to go there, 
<A NAME="252"></A>is outside the general plan of the play. The purpose, again, of his coming 
<A NAME="253"></A>is outside the action proper. However, he comes, he is seized, and, when 
<A NAME="254"></A>on the point of being sacrificed, reveals who he is. The mode of recognition 
<A NAME="255"></A>may be either that of Euripides or of Polyidus, in whose play he exclaims 
<A NAME="256"></A>very naturally: 'So it was not my sister only, but I too, who was doomed 
<A NAME="257"></A>to be sacrificed'; and by that remark he is saved.
<A NAME="258"></A><BR><BR>After this, the names being once given, it remains to fill in the 
<A NAME="259"></A>episodes. We must see that they are relevant to the action. In the case 
<A NAME="260"></A>of Orestes, for example, there is the madness which led to his capture, 
<A NAME="261"></A>and his deliverance by means of the purificatory rite. In the drama, the 
<A NAME="262"></A>episodes are short, but it is these that give extension to Epic poetry. 
<A NAME="263"></A>Thus the story of the Odyssey can be stated briefly. A certain man is absent 
<A NAME="264"></A>from home for many years; he is jealously watched by Poseidon, and left 
<A NAME="265"></A>desolate. Meanwhile his home is in a wretched plight- suitors are wasting 
<A NAME="266"></A>his substance and plotting against his son. At length, tempest-tost, he 
<A NAME="267"></A>himself arrives; he makes certain persons acquainted with him; he attacks 
<A NAME="268"></A>the suitors with his own hand, and is himself preserved while he destroys 
<A NAME="269"></A>them. This is the essence of the plot; the rest is episode.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="270"></A><B>Part XVIII</B>

<A NAME="271"></A><BR><BR>Every tragedy falls into two parts- Complication  and Unraveling 
<A NAME="272"></A>or Denouement. Incidents extraneous to the action are frequently combined 
<A NAME="273"></A>with a portion of the action proper, to form the Complication; the rest 
<A NAME="274"></A>is the Unraveling. By the Complication I mean all that extends from the 
<A NAME="275"></A>beginning of the action to the part which marks the turning-point to good 
<A NAME="276"></A>or bad fortune. The Unraveling is that which extends from the beginning 
<A NAME="277"></A>of the change to the end. Thus, in the Lynceus of Theodectes, the Complication 
<A NAME="278"></A>consists of the incidents presupposed in the drama, the seizure of the 
<A NAME="279"></A>child, and then again ... [the Unraveling] extends from the accusation 
<A NAME="280"></A>of murder to
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>There are four kinds of Tragedy: the Complex, depending entirely 
<A NAME="282"></A>on Reversal of the Situation and Recognition; the Pathetic (where the motive 
<A NAME="283"></A>is passion)- such as the tragedies on Ajax and Ixion; the Ethical (where 
<A NAME="284"></A>the motives are ethical)- such as the Phthiotides and the Peleus. The fourth 
<A NAME="285"></A>kind is the Simple. [We here exclude the purely spectacular element], exemplified 
<A NAME="286"></A>by the Phorcides, the Prometheus, and scenes laid in Hades. The poet should 
<A NAME="287"></A>endeavor, if possible, to combine all poetic elements; or failing that, 
<A NAME="288"></A>the greatest number and those the most important; the more so, in face 
<A NAME="289"></A>of the caviling criticism of the day. For whereas there have hitherto been 
<A NAME="290"></A>good poets, each in his own branch, the critics now expect one man to surpass 
<A NAME="291"></A>all others in their several lines of excellence.
<A NAME="292"></A><BR><BR>In speaking of a tragedy as the same or different, the best test 
<A NAME="293"></A>to take is the plot. Identity exists where the Complication and Unraveling 
<A NAME="294"></A>are the same. Many poets tie the knot well, but unravel it Both arts, however, 
<A NAME="295"></A>should always be mastered.
<A NAME="296"></A><BR><BR>Again, the poet should remember what has been often said, and not 
<A NAME="297"></A>make an Epic structure into a tragedy- by an Epic structure I mean one 
<A NAME="298"></A>with a multiplicity of plots- as if, for instance, you were to make a tragedy 
<A NAME="299"></A>out of the entire story of the Iliad. In the Epic poem, owing to its length, 
<A NAME="300"></A>each part assumes its proper magnitude. In the drama the result is far 
<A NAME="301"></A>from answering to the poet's expectation. The proof is that the poets who 
<A NAME="302"></A>have dramatized the whole story of the Fall of Troy, instead of selecting 
<A NAME="303"></A>portions, like Euripides; or who have taken the whole tale of Niobe, and 
<A NAME="304"></A>not a part of her story, like Aeschylus, either fail utterly or meet with 
<A NAME="305"></A>poor success on the stage. Even Agathon has been known to fail from this 
<A NAME="306"></A>one defect. In his Reversals of the Situation, however, he shows a marvelous 
<A NAME="307"></A>skill in the effort to hit the popular taste- to produce a tragic effect 
<A NAME="308"></A>that satisfies the moral sense. This effect is produced when the clever 
<A NAME="309"></A>rogue, like Sisyphus, is outwitted, or the brave villain defeated. Such 
<A NAME="310"></A>an event is probable in Agathon's sense of the word: 'is probable,' he 
<A NAME="311"></A>says, 'that many things should happen contrary to probability.'
<A NAME="312"></A><BR><BR>The Chorus too should be regarded as one of the actors; it should 
<A NAME="313"></A>be an integral part of the whole, and share in the action, in the manner 
<A NAME="314"></A>not of Euripides but of Sophocles. As for the later poets, their choral 
<A NAME="315"></A>songs pertain as little to the subject of the piece as to that of any other 
<A NAME="316"></A>tragedy. They are, therefore, sung as mere interludes- a practice first 
<A NAME="317"></A>begun by Agathon. Yet what difference is there between introducing such 
<A NAME="318"></A>choral interludes, and transferring a speech, or even a whole act, from 
<A NAME="319"></A>one play to another.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="320"></A><B>Part XIX</B>

<A NAME="321"></A><BR><BR>It remains to speak of Diction and Thought, the other parts of 
<A NAME="322"></A>Tragedy having been already discussed. concerning Thought, we may assume 
<A NAME="323"></A>what is said in the Rhetoric, to which inquiry the subject more strictly 
<A NAME="324"></A>belongs. Under Thought is included every effect which has to be produced 
<A NAME="325"></A>by speech, the subdivisions being: proof and refutation; the excitation 
<A NAME="326"></A>of the feelings, such as pity, fear, anger, and the like; the suggestion 
<A NAME="327"></A>of importance or its opposite. Now, it is evident that the dramatic incidents 
<A NAME="328"></A>must be treated from the same points of view as the dramatic speeches, 
<A NAME="329"></A>when the object is to evoke the sense of pity, fear, importance, or probability. 
<A NAME="330"></A>The only difference is that the incidents should speak for themselves without 
<A NAME="331"></A>verbal exposition; while effects aimed at in should be produced by the 
<A NAME="332"></A>speaker, and as a result of the speech. For what were the business of a 
<A NAME="333"></A>speaker, if the Thought were revealed quite apart from what he 
<A NAME="334"></A>says?
<A NAME="335"></A><BR><BR>Next, as regards Diction. One branch of the inquiry treats of the 
<A NAME="336"></A>Modes of Utterance. But this province of knowledge belongs to the art of 
<A NAME="337"></A>Delivery and to the masters of that science. It includes, for instance- 
<A NAME="338"></A>what is a command, a prayer, a statement, a threat, a question, an answer, 
<A NAME="339"></A>and so forth. To know or not to know these things involves no serious censure 
<A NAME="340"></A>upon the poet's art. For who can admit the fault imputed to Homer by Protagoras- 
<A NAME="341"></A>that in the words, 'Sing, goddess, of the wrath, he gives a command under 
<A NAME="342"></A>the idea that he utters a prayer? For to tell some one to do a thing or 
<A NAME="343"></A>not to do it is, he says, a command. We may, therefore, pass this over 
<A NAME="344"></A>as an inquiry that belongs to another art, not to poetry.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="345"></A><B>Part XX</B>

<A NAME="346"></A><BR><BR>Language in general includes the following parts: Letter, Syllable, 
<A NAME="347"></A>Connecting Word, Noun, Verb, Inflection or Case, Sentence or 
<A NAME="348"></A>Phrase.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>A Letter is an indivisible sound, yet not every such sound, but 
<A NAME="350"></A>only one which can form part of a group of sounds. For even brutes utter 
<A NAME="351"></A>indivisible sounds, none of which I call a letter. The sound I mean may 
<A NAME="352"></A>be either a vowel, a semivowel, or a mute. A vowel is that which without 
<A NAME="353"></A>impact of tongue or lip has an audible sound. A semivowel that which with 
<A NAME="354"></A>such impact has an audible sound, as S and R. A mute, that which with such 
<A NAME="355"></A>impact has by itself no sound, but joined to a vowel sound becomes audible, 
<A NAME="356"></A>as G and D. These are distinguished according to the form assumed by the 
<A NAME="357"></A>mouth and the place where they are produced; according as they are aspirated 
<A NAME="358"></A>or smooth, long or short; as they are acute, grave, or of an intermediate 
<A NAME="359"></A>tone; which inquiry belongs in detail to the writers on 
<A NAME="360"></A>meter.
<A NAME="361"></A><BR><BR>A Syllable is a nonsignificant sound, composed of a mute and a 
<A NAME="362"></A>vowel: for GR without A is a syllable, as also with A- GRA. But the investigation 
<A NAME="363"></A>of these differences belongs also to metrical science.
<A NAME="364"></A><BR><BR>A Connecting Word is a nonsignificant sound, which neither causes 
<A NAME="365"></A>nor hinders the union of many sounds into one significant sound; it may 
<A NAME="366"></A>be placed at either end or in the middle of a sentence. Or, a nonsignificant 
<A NAME="367"></A>sound, which out of several sounds, each of them significant, is capable 
<A NAME="368"></A>of forming one significant sound- as amphi, peri, and the like. Or, a nonsignificant 
<A NAME="369"></A>sound, which marks the beginning, end, or division of a sentence; such, 
<A NAME="370"></A>however, that it cannot correctly stand by itself at the beginning of a 
<A NAME="371"></A>sentence- as men, etoi, de.
<A NAME="372"></A><BR><BR>A Noun is a composite significant sound, not marking time, of which 
<A NAME="373"></A>no part is in itself significant: for in double or compound words we do 
<A NAME="374"></A>not employ the separate parts as if each were in itself significant. Thus 
<A NAME="375"></A>in Theodorus, 'god-given,' the doron or 'gift' is not in itself 
<A NAME="376"></A>significant.
<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>A Verb is a composite significant sound, marking time, in which, 
<A NAME="378"></A>as in the noun, no part is in itself significant. For 'man' or 'white' 
<A NAME="379"></A>does not express the idea of 'when'; but 'he walks' or 'he has walked' 
<A NAME="380"></A>does connote time, present or past.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>Inflection belongs both to the noun and verb, and expresses either 
<A NAME="382"></A>the relation 'of,' 'to,' or the like; or that of number, whether one or 
<A NAME="383"></A>many, as 'man' or 'men'; or the modes or tones in actual delivery, e.g., 
<A NAME="384"></A>a question or a command. 'Did he go?' and 'go' are verbal inflections of 
<A NAME="385"></A>this kind.
<A NAME="386"></A><BR><BR>A Sentence or Phrase is a composite significant sound, some at 
<A NAME="387"></A>least of whose parts are in themselves significant; for not every such 
<A NAME="388"></A>group of words consists of verbs and nouns- 'the definition of man,' for 
<A NAME="389"></A>example- but it may dispense even with the verb. Still it will always have 
<A NAME="390"></A>some significant part, as 'in walking,' or 'Cleon son of Cleon.' A sentence 
<A NAME="391"></A>or phrase may form a unity in two ways- either as signifying one thing, 
<A NAME="392"></A>or as consisting of several parts linked together. Thus the Iliad is one 
<A NAME="393"></A>by the linking together of parts, the definition of man by the unity of 
<A NAME="394"></A>the thing signified.
