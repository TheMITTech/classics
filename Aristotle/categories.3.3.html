<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 9</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Action and affection both admit of contraries and also of variation of 
<A NAME="12"></A>degree. Heating is the contrary of cooling, being heated of being cooled, 
<A NAME="13"></A>being glad of being vexed. Thus they admit of contraries. They also admit 
<A NAME="14"></A>of variation of degree: for it is possible to heat in a greater or less 
<A NAME="15"></A>degree; also to be heated in a greater or less degree. Thus action and 
<A NAME="16"></A>affection also admit of variation of degree. So much, then, is stated with 
<A NAME="17"></A>regard to these categories.
<A NAME="18"></A><BR><BR>We spoke, moreover, of the category of position when we were dealing 
<A NAME="19"></A>with that of relation, and stated that such terms derived their names from 
<A NAME="20"></A>those of the corresponding attitudes.
<A NAME="21"></A><BR><BR>As for the rest, time, place, state, since they are easily intelligible, 
<A NAME="22"></A>I say no more about them than was said at the beginning, that in the category 
<A NAME="23"></A>of state are included such states as 'shod', 'armed', in that of place 
<A NAME="24"></A>'in the Lyceum' and so on, as was explained before.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="25"></A><B>Part 10</B>

<A NAME="26"></A><BR><BR>The proposed categories have, then, been adequately dealt 
<A NAME="27"></A>with.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR>We must next explain the various senses in which the term 'opposite' 
<A NAME="29"></A>is used. Things are said to be opposed in four senses: (i) as correlatives 
<A NAME="30"></A>to one another, (ii) as contraries to one another, (iii) as privatives 
<A NAME="31"></A>to positives, (iv) as affirmatives to negatives.
<A NAME="32"></A><BR><BR>Let me sketch my meaning in outline. An instance of the use of 
<A NAME="33"></A>the word 'opposite' with reference to correlatives is afforded by the expressions 
<A NAME="34"></A>'double' and 'half'; with reference to contraries by 'bad' and 'good'. 
<A NAME="35"></A>Opposites in the sense of 'privatives' and 'positives' are' blindness' 
<A NAME="36"></A>and 'sight'; in the sense of affirmatives and negatives, the propositions 
<A NAME="37"></A>'he sits', 'he does not sit'.
<A NAME="38"></A><BR><BR>(i) Pairs of opposites which fall under the category of relation 
<A NAME="39"></A>are explained by a reference of the one to the other, the reference being 
<A NAME="40"></A>indicated by the preposition 'of' or by some other preposition. Thus, double 
<A NAME="41"></A>is a relative term, for that which is double is explained as the double 
<A NAME="42"></A>of something. Knowledge, again, is the opposite of the thing known, in 
<A NAME="43"></A>the same sense; and the thing known also is explained by its relation to 
<A NAME="44"></A>its opposite, knowledge. For the thing known is explained as that which 
<A NAME="45"></A>is known by something, that is, by knowledge. Such things, then, as are 
<A NAME="46"></A>opposite the one to the other in the sense of being correlatives are explained 
<A NAME="47"></A>by a reference of the one to the other.
<A NAME="48"></A><BR><BR>(ii) Pairs of opposites which are contraries are not in any way 
<A NAME="49"></A>interdependent, but are contrary the one to the other. The good is not 
<A NAME="50"></A>spoken of as the good of the had, but as the contrary of the bad, nor is 
<A NAME="51"></A>white spoken of as the white of the black, but as the contrary of the black. 
<A NAME="52"></A>These two types of opposition are therefore distinct. Those contraries 
<A NAME="53"></A>which are such that the subjects in which they are naturally present, or 
<A NAME="54"></A>of which they are predicated, must necessarily contain either the one or 
<A NAME="55"></A>the other of them, have no intermediate, but those in the case of which 
<A NAME="56"></A>no such necessity obtains, always have an intermediate. Thus disease and 
<A NAME="57"></A>health are naturally present in the body of an animal, and it is necessary 
<A NAME="58"></A>that either the one or the other should be present in the body of an animal. 
<A NAME="59"></A>Odd and even, again, are predicated of number, and it is necessary that 
<A NAME="60"></A>the one or the other should be present in numbers. Now there is no intermediate 
<A NAME="61"></A>between the terms of either of these two pairs. On the other hand, in those 
<A NAME="62"></A>contraries with regard to which no such necessity obtains, we find an intermediate. 
<A NAME="63"></A>Blackness and whiteness are naturally present in the body, but it is not 
<A NAME="64"></A>necessary that either the one or the other should be present in the body, 
<A NAME="65"></A>inasmuch as it is not true to say that everybody must be white or black. 
<A NAME="66"></A>Badness and goodness, again, are predicated of man, and of many other things, 
<A NAME="67"></A>but it is not necessary that either the one quality or the other should 
<A NAME="68"></A>be present in that of which they are predicated: it is not true to say 
<A NAME="69"></A>that everything that may be good or bad must be either good or bad. These 
<A NAME="70"></A>pairs of contraries have intermediates: the intermediates between white 
<A NAME="71"></A>and black are grey, sallow, and all the other colours that come between; 
<A NAME="72"></A>the intermediate between good and bad is that which is neither the one 
<A NAME="73"></A>nor the other.
<A NAME="74"></A><BR><BR>Some intermediate qualities have names, such as grey and sallow 
<A NAME="75"></A>and all the other colours that come between white and black; in other cases, 
<A NAME="76"></A>however, it is not easy to name the intermediate, but we must define it 
<A NAME="77"></A>as that which is not either extreme, as in the case of that which is neither 
<A NAME="78"></A>good nor bad, neither just nor unjust.
<A NAME="79"></A><BR><BR>(iii) 'privatives' and 'Positives' have reference to the same subject. 
<A NAME="80"></A>Thus, sight and blindness have reference to the eye. It is a universal 
<A NAME="81"></A>rule that each of a pair of opposites of this type has reference to that 
<A NAME="82"></A>to which the particular 'positive' is natural. We say that that is capable 
<A NAME="83"></A>of some particular faculty or possession has suffered privation when the 
<A NAME="84"></A>faculty or possession in question is in no way present in that in which, 
<A NAME="85"></A>and at the time at which, it should naturally be present. We do not call 
<A NAME="86"></A>that toothless which has not teeth, or that blind which has not sight, 
<A NAME="87"></A>but rather that which has not teeth or sight at the time when by nature 
<A NAME="88"></A>it should. For there are some creatures which from birth are without sight, 
<A NAME="89"></A>or without teeth, but these are not called toothless or 
<A NAME="90"></A>blind.
<A NAME="91"></A><BR><BR>To be without some faculty or to possess it is not the same as 
<A NAME="92"></A>the corresponding 'privative' or 'positive'. 'Sight' is a 'positive', 'blindness' 
<A NAME="93"></A>a 'privative', but 'to possess sight' is not equivalent to 'sight', 'to 
<A NAME="94"></A>be blind' is not equivalent to 'blindness'. Blindness is a 'privative', 
<A NAME="95"></A>to be blind is to be in a state of privation, but is not a 'privative'. 
<A NAME="96"></A>Moreover, if 'blindness' were equivalent to 'being blind', both would be 
<A NAME="97"></A>predicated of the same subject; but though a man is said to be blind, he 
<A NAME="98"></A>is by no means said to be blindness.
<A NAME="99"></A><BR><BR>To be in a state of 'possession' is, it appears, the opposite of 
<A NAME="100"></A>being in a state of 'privation', just as 'positives' and 'privatives' themselves 
<A NAME="101"></A>are opposite. There is the same type of antithesis in both cases; for just 
<A NAME="102"></A>as blindness is opposed to sight, so is being blind opposed to having 
<A NAME="103"></A>sight.
<A NAME="104"></A><BR><BR>That which is affirmed or denied is not itself affirmation or denial. 
<A NAME="105"></A>By 'affirmation' we mean an affirmative proposition, by 'denial' a negative. 
<A NAME="106"></A>Now, those facts which form the matter of the affirmation or denial are 
<A NAME="107"></A>not propositions; yet these two are said to be opposed in the same sense 
<A NAME="108"></A>as the affirmation and denial, for in this case also the type of antithesis 
<A NAME="109"></A>is the same. For as the affirmation is opposed to the denial, as in the 
<A NAME="110"></A>two propositions 'he sits', 'he does not sit', so also the fact which constitutes 
<A NAME="111"></A>the matter of the proposition in one case is opposed to that in the other, 
<A NAME="112"></A>his sitting, that is to say, to his not sitting.
<A NAME="113"></A><BR><BR>It is evident that 'positives' and 'privatives' are not opposed 
<A NAME="114"></A>each to each in the same sense as relatives. The one is not explained by 
<A NAME="115"></A>reference to the other; sight is not sight of blindness, nor is any other 
<A NAME="116"></A>preposition used to indicate the relation. Similarly blindness is not said 
<A NAME="117"></A>to be blindness of sight, but rather, privation of sight. Relatives, moreover, 
<A NAME="118"></A>reciprocate; if blindness, therefore, were a relative, there would be a 
<A NAME="119"></A>reciprocity of relation between it and that with which it was correlative. 
<A NAME="120"></A>But this is not the case. Sight is not called the sight of 
<A NAME="121"></A>blindness.
<A NAME="122"></A><BR><BR>That those terms which fall under the heads of 'positives' and 
<A NAME="123"></A>'privatives' are not opposed each to each as contraries, either, is plain 
<A NAME="124"></A>from the following facts: Of a pair of contraries such that they have no 
<A NAME="125"></A>intermediate, one or the other must needs be present in the subject in 
<A NAME="126"></A>which they naturally subsist, or of which they are predicated; for it is 
<A NAME="127"></A>those, as we proved,' in the case of which this necessity obtains, that 
<A NAME="128"></A>have no intermediate. Moreover, we cited health and disease, odd and even, 
<A NAME="129"></A>as instances. But those contraries which have an intermediate are not subject 
<A NAME="130"></A>to any such necessity. It is not necessary that every substance, receptive 
<A NAME="131"></A>of such qualities, should be either black or white, cold or hot, for something 
<A NAME="132"></A>intermediate between these contraries may very well be present in the subject. 
<A NAME="133"></A>We proved, moreover, that those contraries have an intermediate in the 
<A NAME="134"></A>case of which the said necessity does not obtain. Yet when one of the two 
<A NAME="135"></A>contraries is a constitutive property of the subject, as it is a constitutive 
<A NAME="136"></A>property of fire to be hot, of snow to be white, it is necessary determinately 
<A NAME="137"></A>that one of the two contraries, not one or the other, should be present 
<A NAME="138"></A>in the subject; for fire cannot be cold, or snow black. Thus, it is not 
<A NAME="139"></A>the case here that one of the two must needs be present in every subject 
<A NAME="140"></A>receptive of these qualities, but only in that subject of which the one 
<A NAME="141"></A>forms a constitutive property. Moreover, in such cases it is one member 
<A NAME="142"></A>of the pair determinately, and not either the one or the other, which must 
<A NAME="143"></A>be present.
<A NAME="144"></A><BR><BR>In the case of 'positives' and 'privatives', on the other hand, 
<A NAME="145"></A>neither of the aforesaid statements holds good. For it is not necessary 
<A NAME="146"></A>that a subject receptive of the qualities should always have either the 
<A NAME="147"></A>one or the other; that which has not yet advanced to the state when sight 
<A NAME="148"></A>is natural is not said either to be blind or to see. Thus 'positives' and 
<A NAME="149"></A>'privatives' do not belong to that class of contraries which consists of 
<A NAME="150"></A>those which have no intermediate. On the other hand, they do not belong 
<A NAME="151"></A>either to that class which consists of contraries which have an intermediate. 
<A NAME="152"></A>For under certain conditions it is necessary that either the one or the 
<A NAME="153"></A>other should form part of the constitution of every appropriate subject. 
<A NAME="154"></A>For when a thing has reached the stage when it is by nature capable of 
<A NAME="155"></A>sight, it will be said either to see or to be blind, and that in an indeterminate 
<A NAME="156"></A>sense, signifying that the capacity may be either present or absent; for 
<A NAME="157"></A>it is not necessary either that it should see or that it should be blind, 
<A NAME="158"></A>but that it should be either in the one state or in the other. Yet in the 
<A NAME="159"></A>case of those contraries which have an intermediate we found that it was 
<A NAME="160"></A>never necessary that either the one or the other should be present in every 
<A NAME="161"></A>appropriate subject, but only that in certain subjects one of the pair 
<A NAME="162"></A>should be present, and that in a determinate sense. It is, therefore, plain 
<A NAME="163"></A>that 'positives' and 'privatives' are not opposed each to each in either 
<A NAME="164"></A>of the senses in which contraries are opposed.
<A NAME="165"></A><BR><BR>Again, in the case of contraries, it is possible that there should 
<A NAME="166"></A>be changes from either into the other, while the subject retains its identity, 
<A NAME="167"></A>unless indeed one of the contraries is a constitutive property of that 
<A NAME="168"></A>subject, as heat is of fire. For it is possible that that that which is 
<A NAME="169"></A>healthy should become diseased, that which is white, black, that which 
<A NAME="170"></A>is cold, hot, that which is good, bad, that which is bad, good. The bad 
<A NAME="171"></A>man, if he is being brought into a better way of life and thought, may 
<A NAME="172"></A>make some advance, however slight, and if he should once improve, even 
<A NAME="173"></A>ever so little, it is plain that he might change completely, or at any 
<A NAME="174"></A>rate make very great progress; for a man becomes more and more easily moved 
<A NAME="175"></A>to virtue, however small the improvement was at first. It is, therefore, 
<A NAME="176"></A>natural to suppose that he will make yet greater progress than he has made 
<A NAME="177"></A>in the past; and as this process goes on, it will change him completely 
<A NAME="178"></A>and establish him in the contrary state, provided he is not hindered by 
<A NAME="179"></A>lack of time. In the case of 'positives' and 'privatives', however, change 
<A NAME="180"></A>in both directions is impossible. There may be a change from possession 
<A NAME="181"></A>to privation, but not from privation to possession. The man who has become 
<A NAME="182"></A>blind does not regain his sight; the man who has become bald does not regain 
<A NAME="183"></A>his hair; the man who has lost his teeth does not grow his grow a new set. 
<A NAME="184"></A>(iv) Statements opposed as affirmation and negation belong manifestly to 
<A NAME="185"></A>a class which is distinct, for in this case, and in this case only, it 
<A NAME="186"></A>is necessary for the one opposite to be true and the other 
<A NAME="187"></A>false.
<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>Neither in the case of contraries, nor in the case of correlatives, 
<A NAME="189"></A>nor in the case of 'positives' and 'privatives', is it necessary for one 
<A NAME="190"></A>to be true and the other false. Health and disease are contraries: neither 
<A NAME="191"></A>of them is true or false. 'Double' and 'half' are opposed to each other 
<A NAME="192"></A>as correlatives: neither of them is true or false. The case is the same, 
<A NAME="193"></A>of course, with regard to 'positives' and 'privatives' such as 'sight' 
<A NAME="194"></A>and 'blindness'. In short, where there is no sort of combination of words, 
<A NAME="195"></A>truth and falsity have no place, and all the opposites we have mentioned 
<A NAME="196"></A>so far consist of simple words.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>At the same time, when the words which enter into opposed statements 
<A NAME="198"></A>are contraries, these, more than any other set of opposites, would seem 
<A NAME="199"></A>to claim this characteristic. 'Socrates is ill' is the contrary of 'Socrates 
<A NAME="200"></A>is well', but not even of such composite expressions is it true to say 
<A NAME="201"></A>that one of the pair must always be true and the other false. For if Socrates 
<A NAME="202"></A>exists, one will be true and the other false, but if he does not exist, 
<A NAME="203"></A>both will be false; for neither 'Socrates is ill' nor 'Socrates is well' 
<A NAME="204"></A>is true, if Socrates does not exist at all.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>In the case of 'positives' and 'privatives', if the subject does 
<A NAME="206"></A>not exist at all, neither proposition is true, but even if the subject 
<A NAME="207"></A>exists, it is not always the fact that one is true and the other false. 
<A NAME="208"></A>For 'Socrates has sight' is the opposite of 'Socrates is blind' in the 
<A NAME="209"></A>sense of the word 'opposite' which applies to possession and privation. 
<A NAME="210"></A>Now if Socrates exists, it is not necessary that one should be true and 
<A NAME="211"></A>the other false, for when he is not yet able to acquire the power of vision, 
<A NAME="212"></A>both are false, as also if Socrates is altogether non-existent.
<A NAME="213"></A><BR><BR>But in the case of affirmation and negation, whether the subject 
<A NAME="214"></A>exists or not, one is always false and the other true. For manifestly, 
<A NAME="215"></A>if Socrates exists, one of the two propositions 'Socrates is ill', 'Socrates 
<A NAME="216"></A>is not ill', is true, and the other false. This is likewise the case if 
<A NAME="217"></A>he does not exist; for if he does not exist, to say that he is ill is false, 
<A NAME="218"></A>to say that he is not ill is true. Thus it is in the case of those opposites 
<A NAME="219"></A>only, which are opposite in the sense in which the term is used with reference 
<A NAME="220"></A>to affirmation and negation, that the rule holds good, that one of the 
<A NAME="221"></A>pair must be true and the other false.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="222"></A><B>Part 11</B>

<A NAME="223"></A><BR><BR>That the contrary of a good is an evil is shown by induction: the 
<A NAME="224"></A>contrary of health is disease, of courage, cowardice, and so on. But the 
<A NAME="225"></A>contrary of an evil is sometimes a good, sometimes an evil. For defect, 
<A NAME="226"></A>which is an evil, has excess for its contrary, this also being an evil, 
<A NAME="227"></A>and the mean. which is a good, is equally the contrary of the one and of 
<A NAME="228"></A>the other. It is only in a few cases, however, that we see instances of 
<A NAME="229"></A>this: in most, the contrary of an evil is a good.
<A NAME="230"></A><BR><BR>In the case of contraries, it is not always necessary that if one 
<A NAME="231"></A>exists the other should also exist: for if all become healthy there will 
<A NAME="232"></A>be health and no disease, and again, if everything turns white, there will 
<A NAME="233"></A>be white, but no black. Again, since the fact that Socrates is ill is the 
<A NAME="234"></A>contrary of the fact that Socrates is well, and two contrary conditions 
<A NAME="235"></A>cannot both obtain in one and the same individual at the same time, both 
<A NAME="236"></A>these contraries could not exist at once: for if that Socrates was well 
<A NAME="237"></A>was a fact, then that Socrates was ill could not possibly be 
<A NAME="238"></A>one.
<A NAME="239"></A><BR><BR>It is plain that contrary attributes must needs be present in subjects 
<A NAME="240"></A>which belong to the same species or genus. Disease and health require as 
<A NAME="241"></A>their subject the body of an animal; white and black require a body, without 
<A NAME="242"></A>further qualification; justice and injustice require as their subject the 
<A NAME="243"></A>human soul.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, it is necessary that pairs of contraries should in all 
<A NAME="245"></A>cases either belong to the same genus or belong to contrary genera or be 
<A NAME="246"></A>themselves genera. White and black belong to the same genus, colour; justice 
<A NAME="247"></A>and injustice, to contrary genera, virtue and vice; while good and evil 
<A NAME="248"></A>do not belong to genera, but are themselves actual genera, with terms under 
<A NAME="249"></A>them.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="250"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="251"></A><BR><BR>There are four senses in which one thing can be said to be 'prior' 
<A NAME="252"></A>to another. Primarily and most properly the term has reference to time: 
<A NAME="253"></A>in this sense the word is used to indicate that one thing is older or more 
<A NAME="254"></A>ancient than another, for the expressions 'older' and 'more ancient' imply 
<A NAME="255"></A>greater length of time.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>Secondly, one thing is said to be 'prior' to another when the sequence 
<A NAME="257"></A>of their being cannot be reversed. In this sense 'one' is 'prior' to 'two'. 
<A NAME="258"></A>For if 'two' exists, it follows directly that 'one' must exist, but if 
<A NAME="259"></A>'one' exists, it does not follow necessarily that 'two' exists: thus the 
<A NAME="260"></A>sequence subsisting cannot be reversed. It is agreed, then, that when the 
<A NAME="261"></A>sequence of two things cannot be reversed, then that one on which the other 
<A NAME="262"></A>depends is called 'prior' to that other.
<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>In the third place, the term 'prior' is used with reference to 
<A NAME="264"></A>any order, as in the case of science and of oratory. For in sciences which 
<A NAME="265"></A>use demonstration there is that which is prior and that which is posterior 
<A NAME="266"></A>in order; in geometry, the elements are prior to the propositions; in reading 
<A NAME="267"></A>and writing, the letters of the alphabet are prior to the syllables. Similarly, 
<A NAME="268"></A>in the case of speeches, the exordium is prior in order to the 
<A NAME="269"></A>narrative.
<A NAME="270"></A><BR><BR>Besides these senses of the word, there is a fourth. That which 
<A NAME="271"></A>is better and more honourable is said to have a natural priority. In common 
<A NAME="272"></A>parlance men speak of those whom they honour and love as 'coming first' 
<A NAME="273"></A>with them. This sense of the word is perhaps the most 
<A NAME="274"></A>far-fetched.
<A NAME="275"></A><BR><BR>Such, then, are the different senses in which the term 'prior' 
<A NAME="276"></A>is used.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>Yet it would seem that besides those mentioned there is yet another. 
<A NAME="278"></A>For in those things, the being of each of which implies that of the other, 
<A NAME="279"></A>that which is in any way the cause may reasonably be said to be by nature 
<A NAME="280"></A>'prior' to the effect. It is plain that there are instances of this. The 
<A NAME="281"></A>fact of the being of a man carries with it the truth of the proposition 
<A NAME="282"></A>that he is, and the implication is reciprocal: for if a man is, the proposition 
<A NAME="283"></A>wherein we allege that he is true, and conversely, if the proposition wherein 
<A NAME="284"></A>we allege that he is true, then he is. The true proposition, however, is 
<A NAME="285"></A>in no way the cause of the being of the man, but the fact of the man's 
<A NAME="286"></A>being does seem somehow to be the cause of the truth of the proposition, 
<A NAME="287"></A>for the truth or falsity of the proposition depends on the fact of the 
<A NAME="288"></A>man's being or not being.
<A NAME="289"></A><BR><BR>Thus the word 'prior' may be used in five senses.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="290"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="291"></A><BR><BR>The term 'simultaneous' is primarily and most appropriately applied 
<A NAME="292"></A>to those things the genesis of the one of which is simultaneous with that 
<A NAME="293"></A>of the other; for in such cases neither is prior or posterior to the other. 
<A NAME="294"></A>Such things are said to be simultaneous in point of time. Those things, 
<A NAME="295"></A>again, are 'simultaneous' in point of nature, the being of each of which 
<A NAME="296"></A>involves that of the other, while at the same time neither is the cause 
<A NAME="297"></A>of the other's being. This is the case with regard to the double and the 
<A NAME="298"></A>half, for these are reciprocally dependent, since, if there is a double, 
<A NAME="299"></A>there is also a half, and if there is a half, there is also a double, while 
<A NAME="300"></A>at the same time neither is the cause of the being of the 
<A NAME="301"></A>other.
<A NAME="302"></A><BR><BR>Again, those species which are distinguished one from another and 
<A NAME="303"></A>opposed one to another within the same genus are said to be 'simultaneous' 
<A NAME="304"></A>in nature. I mean those species which are distinguished each from each 
<A NAME="305"></A>by one and the same method of division. Thus the 'winged' species is simultaneous 
<A NAME="306"></A>with the 'terrestrial' and the 'water' species. These are distinguished 
<A NAME="307"></A>within the same genus, and are opposed each to each, for the genus 'animal' 
<A NAME="308"></A>has the 'winged', the 'terrestrial', and the 'water' species, and no one 
<A NAME="309"></A>of these is prior or posterior to another; on the contrary, all such things 
<A NAME="310"></A>appear to be 'simultaneous' in nature. Each of these also, the terrestrial, 
<A NAME="311"></A>the winged, and the water species, can be divided again into subspecies. 
<A NAME="312"></A>Those species, then, also will be 'simultaneous' point of nature, which, 
<A NAME="313"></A>belonging to the same genus, are distinguished each from each by one and 
<A NAME="314"></A>the same method of differentiation.
<A NAME="315"></A><BR><BR>But genera are prior to species, for the sequence of their being 
<A NAME="316"></A>cannot be reversed. If there is the species 'water-animal', there will 
<A NAME="317"></A>be the genus 'animal', but granted the being of the genus 'animal', it 
<A NAME="318"></A>does not follow necessarily that there will be the species 
<A NAME="319"></A>'water-animal'.
<A NAME="320"></A><BR><BR>Those things, therefore, are said to be 'simultaneous' in nature, 
<A NAME="321"></A>the being of each of which involves that of the other, while at the same 
<A NAME="322"></A>time neither is in any way the cause of the other's being; those species, 
<A NAME="323"></A>also, which are distinguished each from each and opposed within the same 
<A NAME="324"></A>genus. Those things, moreover, are 'simultaneous' in the unqualified sense 
<A NAME="325"></A>of the word which come into being at the same time.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="326"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="327"></A><BR><BR>There are six sorts of movement: generation, destruction, increase, 
<A NAME="328"></A>diminution, alteration, and change of place.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>It is evident in all but one case that all these sorts of movement 
<A NAME="330"></A>are distinct each from each. Generation is distinct from destruction, increase 
<A NAME="331"></A>and change of place from diminution, and so on. But in the case of alteration 
<A NAME="332"></A>it may be argued that the process necessarily implies one or other of the 
<A NAME="333"></A>other five sorts of motion. This is not true, for we may say that all affections, 
<A NAME="334"></A>or nearly all, produce in us an alteration which is distinct from all other 
<A NAME="335"></A>sorts of motion, for that which is affected need not suffer either increase 
<A NAME="336"></A>or diminution or any of the other sorts of motion. Thus alteration is a 
<A NAME="337"></A>distinct sort of motion; for, if it were not, the thing altered would not 
<A NAME="338"></A>only be altered, but would forthwith necessarily suffer increase or diminution 
<A NAME="339"></A>or some one of the other sorts of motion in addition; which as a matter 
<A NAME="340"></A>of fact is not the case. Similarly that which was undergoing the process 
<A NAME="341"></A>of increase or was subject to some other sort of motion would, if alteration 
<A NAME="342"></A>were not a distinct form of motion, necessarily be subject to alteration 
<A NAME="343"></A>also. But there are some things which undergo increase but yet not alteration. 
<A NAME="344"></A>The square, for instance, if a gnomon is applied to it, undergoes increase 
<A NAME="345"></A>but not alteration, and so it is with all other figures of this sort. Alteration 
<A NAME="346"></A>and increase, therefore, are distinct.
<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>Speaking generally, rest is the contrary of motion. But the different 
<A NAME="348"></A>forms of motion have their own contraries in other forms; thus destruction 
<A NAME="349"></A>is the contrary of generation, diminution of increase, rest in a place, 
<A NAME="350"></A>of change of place. As for this last, change in the reverse direction would 
<A NAME="351"></A>seem to be most truly its contrary; thus motion upwards is the contrary 
<A NAME="352"></A>of motion downwards and vice versa.
<A NAME="353"></A><BR><BR>In the case of that sort of motion which yet remains, of those 
<A NAME="354"></A>that have been enumerated, it is not easy to state what is its contrary. 
<A NAME="355"></A>It appears to have no contrary, unless one should define the contrary here 
<A NAME="356"></A>also either as 'rest in its quality' or as 'change in the direction of 
<A NAME="357"></A>the contrary quality', just as we defined the contrary of change of place 
<A NAME="358"></A>either as rest in a place or as change in the reverse direction. For a 
<A NAME="359"></A>thing is altered when change of quality takes place; therefore either rest 
<A NAME="360"></A>in its quality or change in the direction of the contrary may be called 
<A NAME="361"></A>the contrary of this qualitative form of motion. In this way becoming white 
<A NAME="362"></A>is the contrary of becoming black; there is alteration in the contrary 
<A NAME="363"></A>direction, since a change of a qualitative nature takes 
<A NAME="364"></A>place.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="365"></A><B>Part 15</B>

<A NAME="366"></A><BR><BR>The term 'to have' is used in various senses. In the first place 
<A NAME="367"></A>it is used with reference to habit or disposition or any other quality, 
<A NAME="368"></A>for we are said to 'have' a piece of knowledge or a virtue. Then, again, 
<A NAME="369"></A>it has reference to quantity, as, for instance, in the case of a man's 
<A NAME="370"></A>height; for he is said to 'have' a height of three or four cubits. It is 
<A NAME="371"></A>used, moreover, with regard to apparel, a man being said to 'have' a coat 
<A NAME="372"></A>or tunic; or in respect of something which we have on a part of ourselves, 
<A NAME="373"></A>as a ring on the hand: or in respect of something which is a part of us, 
<A NAME="374"></A>as hand or foot. The term refers also to content, as in the case of a vessel 
<A NAME="375"></A>and wheat, or of a jar and wine; a jar is said to 'have' wine, and a corn-measure 
<A NAME="376"></A>wheat. The expression in such cases has reference to content. Or it refers 
<A NAME="377"></A>to that which has been acquired; we are said to 'have' a house or a field. 
<A NAME="378"></A>A man is also said to 'have' a wife, and a wife a husband, and this appears 
<A NAME="379"></A>to be the most remote meaning of the term, for by the use of it we mean 
<A NAME="380"></A>simply that the husband lives with the wife.
<A NAME="381"></A><BR><BR>Other senses of the word might perhaps be found, but the most ordinary 
<A NAME="382"></A>ones have all been enumerated.
