<A NAME="10"></A><B>Part 1</B>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Let us explain the remaining operations of this secretion in the same way 
<A NAME="12"></A>as we have treated the rest. When this exhalation is secreted in small 
<A NAME="13"></A>and scattered quantities and frequently, and is transitory, and its constitution 
<A NAME="14"></A>rare, it gives rise to thunder and lightning. But if it is secreted in 
<A NAME="15"></A>a body and is denser, that is, less rare, we get a hurricane. The fact 
<A NAME="16"></A>that it issues in body explains its violence: it is due to the rapidity 
<A NAME="17"></A>of the secretion. Now when this secretion issues in a great and continuous 
<A NAME="18"></A>current the result corresponds to what we get when the opposite development 
<A NAME="19"></A>takes place and rain and a quantity of water are produced. As far as the 
<A NAME="20"></A>matter from which they are developed goes both sets of phenomena are the 
<A NAME="21"></A>same. As soon as a stimulus to the development of either potentiality appears, 
<A NAME="22"></A>that of which there is the greater quantity present in the cloud is at 
<A NAME="23"></A>once secreted from it, and there results either rain, or, if the other 
<A NAME="24"></A>exhalation prevails, a hurricane.
<A NAME="25"></A><BR><BR>Sometimes the exhalation in the cloud, when it is being secreted, 
<A NAME="26"></A>collides with another under circumstances like those found when a wind 
<A NAME="27"></A>is forced from an open into a narrow space in a gateway or a road. It often 
<A NAME="28"></A>happens in such cases that the first part of the moving body is deflected 
<A NAME="29"></A>because of the resistance due either to the narrowness or to a contrary 
<A NAME="30"></A>current, and so the wind forms a circle and eddy. It is prevented from 
<A NAME="31"></A>advancing in a straight line: at the same time it is pushed on from behind; 
<A NAME="32"></A>so it is compelled to move sideways in the direction of least resistance. 
<A NAME="33"></A>The same thing happens to the next part, and the next, and so on, till 
<A NAME="34"></A>the series becomes one, that is, till a circle is formed: for if a figure 
<A NAME="35"></A>is described by a single motion that figure must itself be one. This is 
<A NAME="36"></A>how eddies are generated on the earth, and the case is the same in the 
<A NAME="37"></A>clouds as far as the beginning of them goes. Only here (as in the case 
<A NAME="38"></A>of the hurricane which shakes off the cloud without cessation and becomes 
<A NAME="39"></A>a continuous wind) the cloud follows the exhalation unbroken, and the exhalation, 
<A NAME="40"></A>failing to break away from the cloud because of its density, first moves 
<A NAME="41"></A>in a circle for the reason given and then descends, because clouds are 
<A NAME="42"></A>always densest on the side where the heat escapes. This phenomenon is called 
<A NAME="43"></A>a whirlwind when it is colourless; and it is a sort of undigested hurricane. 
<A NAME="44"></A>There is never a whirlwind when the weather is northerly, nor a hurricane 
<A NAME="45"></A>when there is snow. The reason is that all these phenomena are 'wind', 
<A NAME="46"></A>and wind is a dry and warm evaporation. Now frost and cold prevail over 
<A NAME="47"></A>this principle and quench it at its birth: that they do prevail is clear 
<A NAME="48"></A>or there could be no snow or northerly rain, since these occur when the 
<A NAME="49"></A>cold does prevail.
<A NAME="50"></A><BR><BR>So the whirlwind originates in the failure of an incipient hurricane 
<A NAME="51"></A>to escape from its cloud: it is due to the resistance which generates the 
<A NAME="52"></A>eddy, and it consists in the spiral which descends to the earth and drags 
<A NAME="53"></A>with it the cloud which it cannot shake off. It moves things by its wind 
<A NAME="54"></A>in the direction in which it is blowing in a straight line, and whirls 
<A NAME="55"></A>round by its circular motion and forcibly snatches up whatever it 
<A NAME="56"></A>meets.
<A NAME="57"></A><BR><BR>When the cloud burns as it is drawn downwards, that is, when the 
<A NAME="58"></A>exhalation becomes rarer, it is called a fire-wind, for its fire colours 
<A NAME="59"></A>the neighbouring air and inflames it.
<A NAME="60"></A><BR><BR>When there is a great quantity of exhalation and it is rare and 
<A NAME="61"></A>is squeezed out in the cloud itself we get a thunderbolt. If the exhalation 
<A NAME="62"></A>is exceedingly rare this rareness prevents the thunderbolt from scorching 
<A NAME="63"></A>and the poets call it 'bright': if the rareness is less it does scorch 
<A NAME="64"></A>and they call it 'smoky'. The former moves rapidly because of its rareness, 
<A NAME="65"></A>and because of its rapidity passes through an object before setting fire 
<A NAME="66"></A>to it or dwelling on it so as to blacken it: the slower one does blacken 
<A NAME="67"></A>the object, but passes through it before it can actually burn it. Further, 
<A NAME="68"></A>resisting substances are affected, unresisting ones are not. For instance, 
<A NAME="69"></A>it has happened that the bronze of a shield has been melted while the woodwork 
<A NAME="70"></A>remained intact because its texture was so loose that the exhalation filtered 
<A NAME="71"></A>through without affecting it. So it has passed through clothes, too, without 
<A NAME="72"></A>burning them, and has merely reduced them to shreds.
<A NAME="73"></A><BR><BR>Such evidence is enough by itself to show that the exhalation is 
<A NAME="74"></A>at work in all these cases, but we sometimes get direct evidence as well, 
<A NAME="75"></A>as in the case of the conflagration of the temple at Ephesus which we lately 
<A NAME="76"></A>witnessed. There independent sheets of flame left the main fire and were 
<A NAME="77"></A>carried bodily in many directions. Now that smoke is exhalation and that 
<A NAME="78"></A>smoke burns is certain, and has been stated in another place before; but 
<A NAME="79"></A>when the flame moves bodily, then we have ocular proof that smoke is exhalation. 
<A NAME="80"></A>On this occasion what is seen in small fires appeared on a much larger 
<A NAME="81"></A>scale because of the quantity of matter that was burning. The beams which 
<A NAME="82"></A>were the source of the exhalation split, and a quantity of it rushed in 
<A NAME="83"></A>a body from the place from which it issued forth and went up in a blaze: 
<A NAME="84"></A>so that the flame was actually seen moving through the air away and falling 
<A NAME="85"></A>on the houses. For we must recognize that exhalation accompanies and precedes 
<A NAME="86"></A>thunderbolts though it is colourless and so invisible. Hence, where the 
<A NAME="87"></A>thunderbolt is going to strike, the object moves before it is struck, showing 
<A NAME="88"></A>that the exhalation leads the way and falls on the object first. Thunder, 
<A NAME="89"></A>too, splits things not by its noise but because the exhalation that strikes 
<A NAME="90"></A>the object and that which makes the noise are ejected simultaneously. This 
<A NAME="91"></A>exhalation splits the thing it strikes but does not scorch it at 
<A NAME="92"></A>all.
<A NAME="93"></A><BR><BR>We have now explained thunder and lightning and hurricane, and 
<A NAME="94"></A>further firewinds, whirlwinds, and thunderbolts, and shown that they are 
<A NAME="95"></A>all of them forms of the same thing and wherein they all 
<A NAME="96"></A>differ.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="97"></A><B>Part 2</B>

<A NAME="98"></A><BR><BR>Let us now explain the nature and cause of halo, rainbow, mock 
<A NAME="99"></A>suns, and rods, since the same account applies to them 
<A NAME="100"></A>all.
<A NAME="101"></A><BR><BR>We must first describe the phenomena and the circumstances in which 
<A NAME="102"></A>each of them occurs. The halo often appears as a complete circle: it is 
<A NAME="103"></A>seen round the sun and the moon and bright stars, by night as well as by 
<A NAME="104"></A>day, and at midday or in the afternoon, more rarely about sunrise or 
<A NAME="105"></A>sunset.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>The rainbow never forms a full circle, nor any segment greater 
<A NAME="107"></A>than a semicircle. At sunset and sunrise the circle is smallest and the 
<A NAME="108"></A>segment largest: as the sun rises higher the circle is larger and the segment 
<A NAME="109"></A>smaller. After the autumn equinox in the shorter days it is seen at every 
<A NAME="110"></A>hour of the day, in the summer not about midday. There are never more than 
<A NAME="111"></A>two rainbows at one time. Each of them is three-coloured; the colours are 
<A NAME="112"></A>the same in both and their number is the same, but in the outer rainbow 
<A NAME="113"></A>they are fainter and their position is reversed. In the inner rainbow the 
<A NAME="114"></A>first and largest band is red; in the outer rainbow the band that is nearest 
<A NAME="115"></A>to this one and smallest is of the same colour: the other bands correspond 
<A NAME="116"></A>on the same principle. These are almost the only colours which painters 
<A NAME="117"></A>cannot manufacture: for there are colours which they create by mixing, 
<A NAME="118"></A>but no mixing will give red, green, or purple. These are the colours of 
<A NAME="119"></A>the rainbow, though between the red and the green an orange colour is often 
<A NAME="120"></A>seen.
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Mock suns and rods are always seen by the side of the sun, not 
<A NAME="122"></A>above or below it nor in the opposite quarter of the sky. They are not 
<A NAME="123"></A>seen at night but always in the neighbourhood of the sun, either as it 
<A NAME="124"></A>is rising or setting but more commonly towards sunset. They have scarcely 
<A NAME="125"></A>ever appeared when the sun was on the meridian, though this once happened 
<A NAME="126"></A>in Bosporus where two mock suns rose with the sun and followed it all through 
<A NAME="127"></A>the day till sunset.
<A NAME="128"></A><BR><BR>These are the facts about each of these phenomena: the cause of 
<A NAME="129"></A>them all is the same, for they are all reflections. But they are different 
<A NAME="130"></A>varieties, and are distinguished by the surface from which and the way 
<A NAME="131"></A>in which the reflection to the sun or some other bright object takes 
<A NAME="132"></A>place.
<A NAME="133"></A><BR><BR>The rainbow is seen by day, and it was formerly thought that it 
<A NAME="134"></A>never appeared by night as a moon rainbow. This opinion was due to the 
<A NAME="135"></A>rarity of the occurrence: it was not observed, for though it does happen 
<A NAME="136"></A>it does so rarely. The reason is that the colours are not so easy to see 
<A NAME="137"></A>in the dark and that many other conditions must coincide, and all that 
<A NAME="138"></A>in a single day in the month. For if there is to be one it must be at full 
<A NAME="139"></A>moon, and then as the moon is either rising or setting. So we have only 
<A NAME="140"></A>met with two instances of a moon rainbow in more than fifty 
<A NAME="141"></A>years.
<A NAME="142"></A><BR><BR>We must accept from the theory of optics the fact that sight is 
<A NAME="143"></A>reflected from air and any object with a smooth surface just as it is from 
<A NAME="144"></A>water; also that in some mirrors the forms of things are reflected, in 
<A NAME="145"></A>others only their colours. Of the latter kind are those mirrors which are 
<A NAME="146"></A>so small as to be indivisible for sense. It is impossible that the figure 
<A NAME="147"></A>of a thing should be reflected in them, for if it is the mirror will be 
<A NAME="148"></A>sensibly divisible since divisibility is involved in the notion of figure. 
<A NAME="149"></A>But since something must be reflected in them and figure cannot be, it 
<A NAME="150"></A>remains that colour alone should be reflected. The colour of a bright object 
<A NAME="151"></A>sometimes appears bright in the reflection, but it sometimes, either owing 
<A NAME="152"></A>to the admixture of the colour of the mirror or to weakness of sight, gives 
<A NAME="153"></A>rise to the appearance of another colour.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>However, we must accept the account we have given of these things 
<A NAME="155"></A>in the theory of sensation, and take some things for granted while we explain 
<A NAME="156"></A>others.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="157"></A><B>Part 3</B>

<A NAME="158"></A><BR><BR>Let us begin by explaining the shape of the halo; why it is a circle 
<A NAME="159"></A>and why it appears round the sun or the moon or one of the other stars: 
<A NAME="160"></A>the explanation being in all these cases the same.
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>Sight is reflected in this way when air and vapour are condensed 
<A NAME="162"></A>into a cloud and the condensed matter is uniform and consists of small 
<A NAME="163"></A>parts. Hence in itself it is a sign of rain, but if it fades away, of fine 
<A NAME="164"></A>weather, if it is broken up, of wind. For if it does not fade away and 
<A NAME="165"></A>is not broken up but is allowed to attain its normal state, it is naturally 
<A NAME="166"></A>a sign of rain since it shows that a process of condensation is proceeding 
<A NAME="167"></A>which must, when it is carried to an end, result in rain. For the same 
<A NAME="168"></A>reason these haloes are the darkest. It is a sign of wind when it is broken 
<A NAME="169"></A>up because its breaking up is due to a wind which exists there but has 
<A NAME="170"></A>not reached us. This view finds support in the fact that the wind blows 
<A NAME="171"></A>from the quarter in which the main division appears in the halo. Its fading 
<A NAME="172"></A>away is a sign of fine weather because if the air is not yet in a state 
<A NAME="173"></A>to get the better of the heat it contains and proceed to condense into 
<A NAME="174"></A>water, this shows that the moist vapour has not yet separated from the 
<A NAME="175"></A>dry and firelike exhalation: and this is the cause of fine 
<A NAME="176"></A>weather.
<A NAME="177"></A><BR><BR>So much for the atmospheric conditions under which the reflection 
<A NAME="178"></A>takes place. The reflection is from the mist that forms round the sun or 
<A NAME="179"></A>the moon, and that is why the halo is not seen opposite the sun like the 
<A NAME="180"></A>rainbow.
<A NAME="181"></A><BR><BR>Since the reflection takes place in the same way from every point 
<A NAME="182"></A>the result is necessarily a circle or a segment of a circle: for if the 
<A NAME="183"></A>lines start from the same point and end at the same point and are equal, 
<A NAME="184"></A>the points where they form an angle will always lie on a 
<A NAME="185"></A>circle.
<A NAME="186"></A><BR><BR>Let AGB and AZB and ADB be lines each of which goes from the point 
<A NAME="187"></A>A to the point B and forms an angle. Let the lines AG, AZ, AD be equal 
<A NAME="188"></A>and those at B, GB, ZB, DB equal too. (See diagram.)
<A NAME="189"></A><BR><BR>Draw the line AEB. Then the triangles are equal; for their base 
<A NAME="190"></A>Aeb is equal. Draw perpendiculars to AEB from the angles; GE from G, Ze 
<A NAME="191"></A>from Z, DE from D. Then these perpendiculars are equal, being in equal 
<A NAME="192"></A>triangles. And they are all in one plane, being all at right angles to 
<A NAME="193"></A>AEB and meeting at a single point E. So if you draw the line it will be 
<A NAME="194"></A>a circle and E its centre. Now B is the sun, A the eye, and the circumference 
<A NAME="195"></A>passing through the points GZD the cloud from which the line of sight is 
<A NAME="196"></A>reflected to the sun.
<A NAME="197"></A><BR><BR>The mirrors must be thought of as contiguous: each of them is too 
<A NAME="198"></A>small to be visible, but their contiguity makes the whole made up of them 
<A NAME="199"></A>all to seem one. The bright band is the sun, which is seen as a circle, 
<A NAME="200"></A>appearing successively in each of the mirrors as a point indivisible to 
<A NAME="201"></A>sense. The band of cloud next to it is black, its colour being intensified 
<A NAME="202"></A>by contrast with the brightness of the halo. The halo is formed rather 
<A NAME="203"></A>near the earth because that is calmer: for where there is wind it is clear 
<A NAME="204"></A>that no halo can maintain its position.
<A NAME="205"></A><BR><BR>Haloes are commoner round the moon because the greater heat of 
<A NAME="206"></A>the sun dissolves the condensations of the air more 
<A NAME="207"></A>rapidly.
<A NAME="208"></A><BR><BR>Haloes are formed round stars for the same reasons, but they are 
<A NAME="209"></A>not prognostic in the same way because the condensation they imply is so 
<A NAME="210"></A>insignificant as to be barren.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="211"></A><B>Part 4</B>

<A NAME="212"></A><BR><BR>We have already stated that the rainbow is a reflection: we have 
<A NAME="213"></A>now to explain what sort of reflection it is, to describe its various concomitants, 
<A NAME="214"></A>and to assign their causes.
<A NAME="215"></A><BR><BR>Sight is reflected from all smooth surfaces, such as are air and 
<A NAME="216"></A>water among others. Air must be condensed if it is to act as a mirror, 
<A NAME="217"></A>though it often gives a reflection even uncondensed when the sight is weak. 
<A NAME="218"></A>Such was the case of a man whose sight was faint and indistinct. He always 
<A NAME="219"></A>saw an image in front of him and facing him as he walked. This was because 
<A NAME="220"></A>his sight was reflected back to him. Its morbid condition made it so weak 
<A NAME="221"></A>and delicate that the air close by acted as a mirror, just as distant and 
<A NAME="222"></A>condensed air normally does, and his sight could not push it back. So promontories 
<A NAME="223"></A>in the sea 'loom' when there is a south-east wind, and everything seems 
<A NAME="224"></A>bigger, and in a mist, too, things seem bigger: so, too, the sun and the 
<A NAME="225"></A>stars seem bigger when rising and setting than on the meridian. But things 
<A NAME="226"></A>are best reflected from water, and even in process of formation it is a 
<A NAME="227"></A>better mirror than air, for each of the particles, the union of which constitutes 
<A NAME="228"></A>a raindrop, is necessarily a better mirror than mist. Now it is obvious 
<A NAME="229"></A>and has already been stated that a mirror of this kind renders the colour 
<A NAME="230"></A>of an object only, but not its shape. Hence it follows that when it is 
<A NAME="231"></A>on the point of raining and the air in the clouds is in process of forming 
<A NAME="232"></A>into raindrops but the rain is not yet actually there, if the sun is opposite, 
<A NAME="233"></A>or any other object bright enough to make the cloud a mirror and cause 
<A NAME="234"></A>the sight to be reflected to the object then the reflection must render 
<A NAME="235"></A>the colour of the object without its shape. Since each of the mirrors is 
<A NAME="236"></A>so small as to be invisible and what we see is the continuous magnitude 
<A NAME="237"></A>made up of them all, the reflection necessarily gives us a continuous magnitude 
<A NAME="238"></A>made up of one colour; each of the mirrors contributing the same colour 
<A NAME="239"></A>to the whole. We may deduce that since these conditions are realizable 
<A NAME="240"></A>there will be an appearance due to reflection whenever the sun and the 
<A NAME="241"></A>cloud are related in the way described and we are between them. But these 
<A NAME="242"></A>are just the conditions under which the rainbow appears. So it is clear 
<A NAME="243"></A>that the rainbow is a reflection of sight to the sun.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>So the rainbow always appears opposite the sun whereas the halo 
<A NAME="245"></A>is round it. They are both reflections, but the rainbow is distinguished 
<A NAME="246"></A>by the variety of its colours. The reflection in the one case is from water 
<A NAME="247"></A>which is dark and from a distance; in the other from air which is nearer 
<A NAME="248"></A>and lighter in colour. White light through a dark medium or on a dark surface 
<A NAME="249"></A>(it makes no difference) looks red. We know how red the flame of green 
<A NAME="250"></A>wood is: this is because so much smoke is mixed with the bright white firelight: 
<A NAME="251"></A>so, too, the sun appears red through smoke and mist. That is why in the 
<A NAME="252"></A>rainbow reflection the outer circumference is red (the reflection being 
<A NAME="253"></A>from small particles of water), but not in the case of the halo. The other 
<A NAME="254"></A>colours shall be explained later. Again, a condensation of this kind cannot 
<A NAME="255"></A>persist in the neighbourhood of the sun: it must either turn to rain or 
<A NAME="256"></A>be dissolved, but opposite to the sun there is an interval during which 
<A NAME="257"></A>the water is formed. If there were not this distinction haloes would be 
<A NAME="258"></A>coloured like the rainbow. Actually no complete or circular halo presents 
<A NAME="259"></A>this colour, only small and fragmentary appearances called 'rods'. But 
<A NAME="260"></A>if a haze due to water or any other dark substance formed there we should 
<A NAME="261"></A>have had, as we maintain, a complete rainbow like that which we do find 
<A NAME="262"></A>lamps. A rainbow appears round these in winter, generally with southerly 
<A NAME="263"></A>winds. Persons whose eyes are moist see it most clearly because their sight 
<A NAME="264"></A>is weak and easily reflected. It is due to the moistness of the air and 
<A NAME="265"></A>the soot which the flame gives off and which mixes with the air and makes 
<A NAME="266"></A>it a mirror, and to the blackness which that mirror derives from the smoky 
<A NAME="267"></A>nature of the soot. The light of the lamp appears as a circle which is 
<A NAME="268"></A>not white but purple. It shows the colours of the rainbow; but because 
<A NAME="269"></A>the sight that is reflected is too weak and the mirror too dark, red is 
<A NAME="270"></A>absent. The rainbow that is seen when oars are raised out of the sea involves 
<A NAME="271"></A>the same relative positions as that in the sky, but its colour is more 
<A NAME="272"></A>like that round the lamps, being purple rather than red. The reflection 
<A NAME="273"></A>is from very small particles continuous with one another, and in this case 
<A NAME="274"></A>the particles are fully formed water. We get a rainbow, too, if a man sprinkles 
<A NAME="275"></A>fine drops in a room turned to the sun so that the sun is shining in part 
<A NAME="276"></A>of the room and throwing a shadow in the rest. Then if one man sprinkles 
<A NAME="277"></A>in the room, another, standing outside, sees a rainbow where the sun's 
<A NAME="278"></A>rays cease and make the shadow. Its nature and colour is like that from 
<A NAME="279"></A>the oars and its cause is the same, for the sprinkling hand corresponds 
<A NAME="280"></A>to the oar.
<A NAME="281"></A><BR><BR>That the colours of the rainbow are those we described and how 
<A NAME="282"></A>the other colours come to appear in it will be clear from the following 
<A NAME="283"></A>considerations. We must recognize, as we have said, and lay down: first, 
<A NAME="284"></A>that white colour on a black surface or seen through a black medium gives 
<A NAME="285"></A>red; second, that sight when strained to a distance becomes weaker and 
<A NAME="286"></A>less; third, that black is in a sort the negation of sight: an object is 
<A NAME="287"></A>black because sight fails; so everything at a distance looks blacker, because 
<A NAME="288"></A>sight does not reach it. The theory of these matters belongs to the account 
<A NAME="289"></A>of the senses, which are the proper subjects of such an inquiry; we need 
<A NAME="290"></A>only state about them what is necessary for us. At all events, that is 
<A NAME="291"></A>the reason why distant objects and objects seen in a mirror look darker 
<A NAME="292"></A>and smaller and smoother, why the reflection of clouds in water is darker 
<A NAME="293"></A>than the clouds themselves. This latter is clearly the case: the reflection 
<A NAME="294"></A>diminishes the sight that reaches them. It makes no difference whether 
<A NAME="295"></A>the change is in the object seen or. in the sight, the result being in 
<A NAME="296"></A>either case the same. The following fact further is worth noticing. When 
<A NAME="297"></A>there is a cloud near the sun and we look at it does not look coloured 
<A NAME="298"></A>at all but white, but when we look at the same cloud in water it shows 
<A NAME="299"></A>a trace of rainbow colouring. Clearly, then, when sight is reflected it 
<A NAME="300"></A>is weakened and, as it makes dark look darker, so it makes white look less 
<A NAME="301"></A>white, changing it and bringing it nearer to black. When the sight is relatively 
<A NAME="302"></A>strong the change is to red; the next stage is green, and a further degree 
<A NAME="303"></A>of weakness gives violet. No further change is visible, but three completes 
<A NAME="304"></A>the series of colours (as we find three does in most other things), and 
<A NAME="305"></A>the change into the rest is imperceptible to sense. Hence also the rainbow 
<A NAME="306"></A>appears with three colours; this is true of each of the two, but in a contrary 
<A NAME="307"></A>way. The outer band of the primary rainbow is red: for the largest band 
<A NAME="308"></A>reflects most sight to the sun, and the outer band is largest. The middle 
<A NAME="309"></A>band and the third go on the same principle. So if the principles we laid 
<A NAME="310"></A>down about the appearance of colours are true the rainbow necessarily has 
<A NAME="311"></A>three colours, and these three and no others. The appearance of yellow 
<A NAME="312"></A>is due to contrast, for the red is whitened by its juxtaposition with green. 
<A NAME="313"></A>We can see this from the fact that the rainbow is purest when the cloud 
<A NAME="314"></A>is blackest; and then the red shows most yellow. (Yellow in the rainbow 
<A NAME="315"></A>comes between red and green.) So the whole of the red shows white by contrast 
<A NAME="316"></A>with the blackness of the cloud around: for it is white compared to the 
<A NAME="317"></A>cloud and the green. Again, when the rainbow is fading away and the red 
<A NAME="318"></A>is dissolving, the white cloud is brought into contact with the green and 
<A NAME="319"></A>becomes yellow. But the moon rainbow affords the best instance of this 
<A NAME="320"></A>colour contrast. It looks quite white: this is because it appears on the 
<A NAME="321"></A>dark cloud and at night. So, just as fire is intensified by added fire, 
<A NAME="322"></A>black beside black makes that which is in some degree white look quite 
<A NAME="323"></A>white. Bright dyes too show the effect of contrast. In woven and embroidered 
<A NAME="324"></A>stuffs the appearance of colours is profoundly affected by their juxtaposition 
<A NAME="325"></A>with one another (purple, for instance, appears different on white and 
<A NAME="326"></A>on black wool), and also by differences of illumination. Thus embroiderers 
<A NAME="327"></A>say that they often make mistakes in their colours when they work by lamplight, 
<A NAME="328"></A>and use the wrong ones.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>We have now shown why the rainbow has three colours and that these 
<A NAME="330"></A>are its only colours. The same cause explains the double rainbow and the 
<A NAME="331"></A>faintness of the colours in the outer one and their inverted order. When 
<A NAME="332"></A>sight is strained to a great distance the appearance of the distant object 
<A NAME="333"></A>is affected in a certain way: and the same thing holds good here. So the 
<A NAME="334"></A>reflection from the outer rainbow is weaker because it takes place from 
<A NAME="335"></A>a greater distance and less of it reaches the sun, and so the colours seen 
<A NAME="336"></A>are fainter. Their order is reversed because more reflection reaches the 
<A NAME="337"></A>sun from the smaller, inner band. For that reflection is nearer to our 
<A NAME="338"></A>sight which is reflected from the band which is nearest to the primary 
<A NAME="339"></A>rainbow. Now the smallest band in the outer rainbow is that which is nearest, 
<A NAME="340"></A>and so it will be red; and the second and the third will follow the same 
<A NAME="341"></A>principle. Let B be the outer rainbow, A the inner one; let R stand for 
<A NAME="342"></A>the red colour, G for green, V for violet; yellow appears at the point 
<A NAME="343"></A>Y. Three rainbows or more are not found because even the second is fainter, 
<A NAME="344"></A>so that the third reflection can have no strength whatever and cannot reach 
<A NAME="345"></A>the sun at all. (See diagram.)
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="346"></A><B>Part 5</B>

<A NAME="347"></A><BR><BR>The rainbow can never be a circle nor a segment of a circle greater 
<A NAME="348"></A>than a semicircle. The consideration of the diagram will prove this and 
<A NAME="349"></A>the other properties of the rainbow. (See diagram.)
<A NAME="350"></A><BR><BR>Let A be a hemisphere resting on the circle of the horizon, let 
<A NAME="351"></A>its centre be K and let H be another point appearing on the horizon. Then, 
<A NAME="352"></A>if the lines that fall in a cone from K have HK as their axis, and, K and 
<A NAME="353"></A>M being joined, the lines KM are reflected from the hemisphere to H over 
<A NAME="354"></A>the greater angle, the lines from K will fall on the circumference of a 
<A NAME="355"></A>circle. If the reflection takes place when the luminous body is rising 
<A NAME="356"></A>or setting the segment of the circle above the earth which is cut off by 
<A NAME="357"></A>the horizon will be a semi-circle; if the luminous body is above the horizon 
<A NAME="358"></A>it will always be less than a semicircle, and it will be smallest when 
<A NAME="359"></A>the luminous body culminates. First let the luminous body be appearing 
<A NAME="360"></A>on the horizon at the point H, and let KM be reflected to H, and let the 
<A NAME="361"></A>plane in which A is, determined by the triangle HKM, be produced. Then 
<A NAME="362"></A>the section of the sphere will be a great circle. Let it be A (for it makes 
<A NAME="363"></A>no difference which of the planes passing through the line HK and determined 
<A NAME="364"></A>by the triangle KMH is produced). Now the lines drawn from H and K to a 
<A NAME="365"></A>point on the semicircle A are in a certain ratio to one another, and no 
<A NAME="366"></A>lines drawn from the same points to another point on that semicircle can 
<A NAME="367"></A>have the same ratio. For since both the points H and K and the line KH 
<A NAME="368"></A>are given, the line MH will be given too; consequently the ratio of the 
<A NAME="369"></A>line MH to the line MK will be given too. So M will touch a given circumference. 
<A NAME="370"></A>Let this be NM. Then the intersection of the circumferences is given, and 
<A NAME="371"></A>the same ratio cannot hold between lines in the same plane drawn from the 
<A NAME="372"></A>same points to any other circumference but MN.
<A NAME="373"></A><BR><BR>Draw a line DB outside of the figure and divide it so that D:B=MH:MK. 
<A NAME="374"></A>But MH is greater than MK since the reflection of the cone is over the 
<A NAME="375"></A>greater angle (for it subtends the greater angle of the triangle KMH). 
<A NAME="376"></A>Therefore D is greater than B. Then add to B a line Z such that B+Z:D=D:B. 
<A NAME="377"></A>Then make another line having the same ratio to B as KH has to Z, and join 
<A NAME="378"></A>MI.
<A NAME="379"></A><BR><BR>Then I is the pole of the circle on which the lines from K fall. 
<A NAME="380"></A>For the ratio of D to IM is the same as that of Z to KH and of B to KI. 
<A NAME="381"></A>If not, let D be in the same ratio to a line indifferently lesser or greater 
<A NAME="382"></A>than IM, and let this line be IP. Then HK and KI and IP will have the same 
<A NAME="383"></A>ratios to one another as Z, B, and D. But the ratios between Z, B, and 
<A NAME="384"></A>D were such that Z+B:D=D: B. Therefore Ih:IP=IP:IK. Now, if the points 
<A NAME="385"></A>K, H be joined with the point P by the lines HP, KP, these lines will be 
<A NAME="386"></A>to one another as IH is to IP, for the sides of the triangles HIP, KPI 
<A NAME="387"></A>about the angle I are homologous. Therefore, HP too will be to KP as HI 
<A NAME="388"></A>is to IP. But this is also the ratio of MH to MK, for the ratio both of 
<A NAME="389"></A>HI to IP and of Mh to MK is the same as that of D to B. Therefore, from 
<A NAME="390"></A>the points H, K there will have been drawn lines with the same ratio to 
<A NAME="391"></A>one another, not only to the circumference MN but to another point as well, 
<A NAME="392"></A>which is impossible. Since then D cannot bear that ratio to any line either 
<A NAME="393"></A>lesser or greater than IM (the proof being in either case the same), it 
<A NAME="394"></A>follows that it must stand in that ratio to MI itself. Therefore as MI 
<A NAME="395"></A>is to IK so IH will be to MI and finally MH to Mk.
<A NAME="396"></A><BR><BR>If, then, a circle be described with I as pole at the distance 
<A NAME="397"></A>MI it will touch all the angles which the lines from H and K make by their 
<A NAME="398"></A>reflection. If not, it can be shown, as before, that lines drawn to different 
<A NAME="399"></A>points in the semicircle will have the same ratio to one another, which 
<A NAME="400"></A>was impossible. If, then, the semicircle A be revolved about the diameter 
<A NAME="401"></A>HKI, the lines reflected from the points H, K at the point M will have 
<A NAME="402"></A>the same ratio, and will make the angle KMH equal, in every plane. Further, 
<A NAME="403"></A>the angle which HM and MI make with HI will always be the same. So there 
<A NAME="404"></A>are a number of triangles on HI and KI equal to the triangles HMI and KMI. 
<A NAME="405"></A>Their perpendiculars will fall on HI at the same point and will be equal. 
<A NAME="406"></A>Let O be the point on which they fall. Then O is the centre of the circle, 
<A NAME="407"></A>half of which, MN, is cut off by the horizon. (See diagram.)
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>Next let the horizon be ABG but let H have risen above the horizon. 
<A NAME="409"></A>Let the axis now be HI. The proof will be the same for the rest as before, 
<A NAME="410"></A>but the pole I of the circle will be below the horizon Ag since the point 
<A NAME="411"></A>H has risen above the horizon. But the pole, and the centre of the circle, 
<A NAME="412"></A>and the centre of that circle (namely HI) which now determines the position 
<A NAME="413"></A>of the sun are on the same line. But since KH lies above the diameter AG, 
<A NAME="414"></A>the centre will be at O on the line KI below the plane of the circle AG 
<A NAME="415"></A>determined the position of the sun before. So the segment YX which is above 
<A NAME="416"></A>the horizon will be less than a semicircle. For YXM was a semicircle and 
<A NAME="417"></A>it has now been cut off by the horizon AG. So part of it, YM, will be invisible 
<A NAME="418"></A>when the sun has risen above the horizon, and the segment visible will 
<A NAME="419"></A>be smallest when the sun is on the meridian; for the higher H is the lower 
<A NAME="420"></A>the pole and the centre of the circle will be.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>In the shorter days after the autumn equinox there may be a rainbow 
<A NAME="422"></A>at any time of the day, but in the longer days from the spring to the autumn 
<A NAME="423"></A>equinox there cannot be a rainbow about midday. The reason for this is 
<A NAME="424"></A>that when the sun is north of the equator the visible arcs of its course 
<A NAME="425"></A>are all greater than a semicircle, and go on increasing, while the invisible 
<A NAME="426"></A>arc is small, but when the sun is south of the equator the visible arc 
<A NAME="427"></A>is small and the invisible arc great, and the farther the sun moves south 
<A NAME="428"></A>of the equator the greater is the invisible arc. Consequently, in the days 
<A NAME="429"></A>near the summer solstice, the size of the visible arc is such that before 
<A NAME="430"></A>the point H reaches the middle of that arc, that is its point of culmination, 
<A NAME="431"></A>the point is well below the horizon; the reason for this being the great 
<A NAME="432"></A>size of the visible arc, and the consequent distance of the point of culmination 
<A NAME="433"></A>from the earth. But in the days near the winter solstice the visible arcs 
<A NAME="434"></A>are small, and the contrary is necessarily the case: for the sun is on 
<A NAME="435"></A>the meridian before the point H has risen far.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="436"></A><B>Part 6</B>

<A NAME="437"></A><BR><BR>Mock suns, and rods too, are due to the causes we have described. 
<A NAME="438"></A>A mock sun is caused by the reflection of sight to the sun. Rods are seen 
<A NAME="439"></A>when sight reaches the sun under circumstances like those which we described, 
<A NAME="440"></A>when there are clouds near the sun and sight is reflected from some liquid 
<A NAME="441"></A>surface to the cloud. Here the clouds themselves are colourless when you 
<A NAME="442"></A>look at them directly, but in the water they are full of rods. The only 
<A NAME="443"></A>difference is that in this latter case the colour of the cloud seems to 
<A NAME="444"></A>reside in the water, but in the case of rods on the cloud itself. Rods 
<A NAME="445"></A>appear when the composition of the cloud is uneven, dense in part and in 
<A NAME="446"></A>part rare, and more and less watery in different parts. Then the sight 
<A NAME="447"></A>is reflected to the sun: the mirrors are too small for the shape of the 
<A NAME="448"></A>sun to appear, but, the bright white light of the sun, to which the sight 
<A NAME="449"></A>is reflected, being seen on the uneven mirror, its colour appears partly 
<A NAME="450"></A>red, partly green or yellow. It makes no difference whether sight passes 
<A NAME="451"></A>through or is reflected from a medium of that kind; the colour is the same 
<A NAME="452"></A>in both cases; if it is red in the first case it must be the same in the 
<A NAME="453"></A>other.
<A NAME="454"></A><BR><BR>Rods then are occasioned by the unevenness of the mirror-as regards 
<A NAME="455"></A>colour, not form. The mock sun, on the contrary, appears when the air is 
<A NAME="456"></A>very uniform, and of the same density throughout. This is why it is white: 
<A NAME="457"></A>the uniform character of the mirror gives the reflection in it a single 
<A NAME="458"></A>colour, while the fact that the sight is reflected in a body and is thrown 
<A NAME="459"></A>on the sun all together by the mist, which is dense and watery though not 
<A NAME="460"></A>yet quite water, causes the sun's true colour to appear just as it does 
<A NAME="461"></A>when the reflection is from the dense, smooth surface of copper. So the 
<A NAME="462"></A>sun's colour being white, the mock sun is white too. This, too, is the 
<A NAME="463"></A>reason why the mock sun is a surer sign of rain than the rods; it indicates, 
<A NAME="464"></A>more than they do, that the air is ripe for the production of water. Further 
<A NAME="465"></A>a mock sun to the south is a surer sign of rain than one to the north, 
<A NAME="466"></A>for the air in the south is readier to turn into water than that in the 
<A NAME="467"></A>north.
<A NAME="468"></A><BR><BR>Mock suns and rods are found, as we stated, about sunset and sunrise, 
<A NAME="469"></A>not above the sun nor below it, but beside it. They are not found very 
<A NAME="470"></A>close to the sun, nor very far from it, for the sun dissolves the cloud 
<A NAME="471"></A>if it is near, but if it is far off the reflection cannot take place, since 
<A NAME="472"></A>sight weakens when it is reflected from a small mirror to a very distant 
<A NAME="473"></A>object. (This is why a halo is never found opposite to the sun.) If the 
<A NAME="474"></A>cloud is above the sun and close to it the sun will dissolve it; if it 
<A NAME="475"></A>is above the sun but at a distance the sight is too weak for the reflection 
<A NAME="476"></A>to take place, and so it will not reach the sun. But at the side of the 
<A NAME="477"></A>sun, it is possible for the mirror to be at such an interval that the sun 
<A NAME="478"></A>does not dissolve the cloud, and yet sight reaches it undiminished because 
<A NAME="479"></A>it moves close to the earth and is not dissipated in the immensity of space. 
<A NAME="480"></A>It cannot subsist below the sun because close to the earth the sun's rays 
<A NAME="481"></A>would dissolve it, but if it were high up and the sun in the middle of 
<A NAME="482"></A>the heavens, sight would be dissipated. Indeed, even by the side of the 
<A NAME="483"></A>sun, it is not found when the sun is in the middle of the sky, for then 
<A NAME="484"></A>the line of vision is not close to the earth, and so but little sight reaches 
<A NAME="485"></A>the mirror and the reflection from it is altogether 
<A NAME="486"></A>feeble.
<A NAME="487"></A><BR><BR>Some account has now been given of the effects of the secretion 
<A NAME="488"></A>above the surface of the earth; we must go on to describe its operations 
<A NAME="489"></A>below, when it is shut up in the parts of the earth.
<A NAME="490"></A><BR><BR>Just as its twofold nature gives rise to various effects in the 
<A NAME="491"></A>upper region, so here it causes two varieties of bodies. We maintain that 
<A NAME="492"></A>there are two exhalations, one vaporous the other smoky, and there correspond 
<A NAME="493"></A>two kinds of bodies that originate in the earth, 'fossiles' and metals. 
<A NAME="494"></A>The heat of the dry exhalation is the cause of all 'fossiles'. Such are 
<A NAME="495"></A>the kinds of stones that cannot be melted, and realgar, and ochre, and 
<A NAME="496"></A>ruddle, and sulphur, and the other things of that kind, most 'fossiles' 
<A NAME="497"></A>being either coloured lye or, like cinnabar, a stone compounded of it. 
<A NAME="498"></A>The vaporous exhalation is the cause of all metals, those bodies which 
<A NAME="499"></A>are either fusible or malleable such as iron, copper, gold. All these originate 
<A NAME="500"></A>from the imprisonment of the vaporous exhalation in the earth, and especially 
<A NAME="501"></A>in stones. Their dryness compresses it, and it congeals just as dew or 
<A NAME="502"></A>hoar-frost does when it has been separated off, though in the present case 
<A NAME="503"></A>the metals are generated before that segregation occurs. Hence, they are 
<A NAME="504"></A>water in a sense, and in a sense not. Their matter was that which might 
<A NAME="505"></A>have become water, but it can no longer do so: nor are they, like savours, 
<A NAME="506"></A>due to a qualitative change in actual water. Copper and gold are not formed 
<A NAME="507"></A>like that, but in every case the evaporation congealed before water was 
<A NAME="508"></A>formed. Hence, they all (except gold) are affected by fire, and they possess 
<A NAME="509"></A>an admixture of earth; for they still contain the dry 
<A NAME="510"></A>exhalation.
<A NAME="511"></A><BR><BR>This is the general theory of all these bodies, but we must take 
<A NAME="512"></A>up each kind of them and discuss it separately.
