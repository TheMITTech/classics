<A NAME="start"></A>

<A NAME="10"></A>1
<A NAME="11"></A><BR><BR>Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, 
<A NAME="12"></A>is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the good has rightly 
<A NAME="13"></A>been declared to be that at which all things aim. But a certain difference 
<A NAME="14"></A>is found among ends; some are activities, others are products apart from 
<A NAME="15"></A>the activities that produce them. Where there are ends apart from the actions, 
<A NAME="16"></A>it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities. Now, 
<A NAME="17"></A>as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends also are many; 
<A NAME="18"></A>the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that 
<A NAME="19"></A>of strategy victory, that of economics wealth. But where such arts fall 
<A NAME="20"></A>under a single capacity- as bridle-making and the other arts concerned 
<A NAME="21"></A>with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and 
<A NAME="22"></A>every military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall under 
<A NAME="23"></A>yet others- in all of these the ends of the master arts are to be preferred 
<A NAME="24"></A>to all the subordinate ends; for it is for the sake of the former that 
<A NAME="25"></A>the latter are pursued. It makes no difference whether the activities themselves 
<A NAME="26"></A>are the ends of the actions, or something else apart from the activities, 
<A NAME="27"></A>as in the case of the sciences just mentioned.
<A NAME="28"></A><BR><BR>2
<A NAME="29"></A><BR><BR>If, then, there is some end of the things we do, which we desire 
<A NAME="30"></A>for its own sake (everything else being desired for the sake of this), 
<A NAME="31"></A>and if we do not choose everything for the sake of something else (for 
<A NAME="32"></A>at that rate the process would go on to infinity, so that our desire would 
<A NAME="33"></A>be empty and vain), clearly this must be the good and the chief good. Will 
<A NAME="34"></A>not the knowledge of it, then, have a great influence on life? Shall we 
<A NAME="35"></A>not, like archers who have a mark to aim at, be more likely to hit upon 
<A NAME="36"></A>what is right? If so, we must try, in outline at least, to determine what 
<A NAME="37"></A>it is, and of which of the sciences or capacities it is the object. It 
<A NAME="38"></A>would seem to belong to the most authoritative art and that which is most 
<A NAME="39"></A>truly the master art. And politics appears to be of this nature; for it 
<A NAME="40"></A>is this that ordains which of the sciences should be studied in a state, 
<A NAME="41"></A>and which each class of citizens should learn and up to what point they 
<A NAME="42"></A>should learn them; and we see even the most highly esteemed of capacities 
<A NAME="43"></A>to fall under this, e.g. strategy, economics, rhetoric; now, since politics 
<A NAME="44"></A>uses the rest of the sciences, and since, again, it legislates as to what 
<A NAME="45"></A>we are to do and what we are to abstain from, the end of this science must 
<A NAME="46"></A>include those of the others, so that this end must be the good for man. 
<A NAME="47"></A>For even if the end is the same for a single man and for a state, that 
<A NAME="48"></A>of the state seems at all events something greater and more complete whether 
<A NAME="49"></A>to attain or to preserve; though it is worth while to attain the end merely 
<A NAME="50"></A>for one man, it is finer and more godlike to attain it for a nation or 
<A NAME="51"></A>for city-states. These, then, are the ends at which our inquiry aims, since 
<A NAME="52"></A>it is political science, in one sense of that term.
<A NAME="53"></A><BR><BR>3
<A NAME="54"></A><BR><BR>Our discussion will be adequate if it has as much clearness as 
<A NAME="55"></A>the subject-matter admits of, for precision is not to be sought for alike 
<A NAME="56"></A>in all discussions, any more than in all the products of the crafts. Now 
<A NAME="57"></A>fine and just actions, which political science investigates, admit of much 
<A NAME="58"></A>variety and fluctuation of opinion, so that they may be thought to exist 
<A NAME="59"></A>only by convention, and not by nature. And goods also give rise to a similar 
<A NAME="60"></A>fluctuation because they bring harm to many people; for before now men 
<A NAME="61"></A>have been undone by reason of their wealth, and others by reason of their 
<A NAME="62"></A>courage. We must be content, then, in speaking of such subjects and with 
<A NAME="63"></A>such premisses to indicate the truth roughly and in outline, and in speaking 
<A NAME="64"></A>about things which are only for the most part true and with premisses of 
<A NAME="65"></A>the same kind to reach conclusions that are no better. In the same spirit, 
<A NAME="66"></A>therefore, should each type of statement be received; for it is the mark 
<A NAME="67"></A>of an educated man to look for precision in each class of things just so 
<A NAME="68"></A>far as the nature of the subject admits; it is evidently equally foolish 
<A NAME="69"></A>to accept probable reasoning from a mathematician and to demand from a 
<A NAME="70"></A>rhetorician scientific proofs.
<A NAME="71"></A><BR><BR>Now each man judges well the things he knows, and of these he is 
<A NAME="72"></A>a good judge. And so the man who has been educated in a subject is a good 
<A NAME="73"></A>judge of that subject, and the man who has received an all-round education 
<A NAME="74"></A>is a good judge in general. Hence a young man is not a proper hearer of 
<A NAME="75"></A>lectures on political science; for he is inexperienced in the actions that 
<A NAME="76"></A>occur in life, but its discussions start from these and are about these; 
<A NAME="77"></A>and, further, since he tends to follow his passions, his study will be 
<A NAME="78"></A>vain and unprofitable, because the end aimed at is not knowledge but action. 
<A NAME="79"></A>And it makes no difference whether he is young in years or youthful in 
<A NAME="80"></A>character; the defect does not depend on time, but on his living, and pursuing 
<A NAME="81"></A>each successive object, as passion directs. For to such persons, as to 
<A NAME="82"></A>the incontinent, knowledge brings no profit; but to those who desire and 
<A NAME="83"></A>act in accordance with a rational principle knowledge about such matters 
<A NAME="84"></A>will be of great benefit.
<A NAME="85"></A><BR><BR>These remarks about the student, the sort of treatment to be expected, 
<A NAME="86"></A>and the purpose of the inquiry, may be taken as our 
<A NAME="87"></A>preface.
<A NAME="88"></A><BR><BR>4
<A NAME="89"></A><BR><BR>Let us resume our inquiry and state, in view of the fact that all 
<A NAME="90"></A>knowledge and every pursuit aims at some good, what it is that we say political 
<A NAME="91"></A>science aims at and what is the highest of all goods achievable by action. 
<A NAME="92"></A>Verbally there is very general agreement; for both the general run of men 
<A NAME="93"></A>and people of superior refinement say that it is happiness, and identify 
<A NAME="94"></A>living well and doing well with being happy; but with regard to what happiness 
<A NAME="95"></A>is they differ, and the many do not give the same account as the wise. 
<A NAME="96"></A>For the former think it is some plain and obvious thing, like pleasure, 
<A NAME="97"></A>wealth, or honour; they differ, however, from one another- and often even 
<A NAME="98"></A>the same man identifies it with different things, with health when he is 
<A NAME="99"></A>ill, with wealth when he is poor; but, conscious of their ignorance, they 
<A NAME="100"></A>admire those who proclaim some great ideal that is above their comprehension. 
<A NAME="101"></A>Now some thought that apart from these many goods there is another which 
<A NAME="102"></A>is self-subsistent and causes the goodness of all these as well. To examine 
<A NAME="103"></A>all the opinions that have been held were perhaps somewhat fruitless; enough 
<A NAME="104"></A>to examine those that are most prevalent or that seem to be 
<A NAME="105"></A>arguable.
<A NAME="106"></A><BR><BR>Let us not fail to notice, however, that there is a difference 
<A NAME="107"></A>between arguments from and those to the first principles. For Plato, too, 
<A NAME="108"></A>was right in raising this question and asking, as he used to do, 'are we 
<A NAME="109"></A>on the way from or to the first principles?' There is a difference, as 
<A NAME="110"></A>there is in a race-course between the course from the judges to the turning-point 
<A NAME="111"></A>and the way back. For, while we must begin with what is known, things are 
<A NAME="112"></A>objects of knowledge in two senses- some to us, some without qualification. 
<A NAME="113"></A>Presumably, then, we must begin with things known to us. Hence any one 
<A NAME="114"></A>who is to listen intelligently to lectures about what is noble and just, 
<A NAME="115"></A>and generally, about the subjects of political science must have been brought 
<A NAME="116"></A>up in good habits. For the fact is the starting-point, and if this is sufficiently 
<A NAME="117"></A>plain to him, he will not at the start need the reason as well; and the 
<A NAME="118"></A>man who has been well brought up has or can easily get startingpoints. 
<A NAME="119"></A>And as for him who neither has nor can get them, let him hear the words 
<A NAME="120"></A>of Hesiod:
<A NAME="121"></A><BR><BR>Far best is he who knows all things himself;
<A NAME="122"></A><BR>Good, he that hearkens when men counsel right;
<A NAME="123"></A><BR>But he who neither knows, nor lays to heart
<A NAME="124"></A><BR>Another's wisdom, is a useless wight.
<A NAME="125"></A><BR>5
<A NAME="126"></A><BR><BR>Let us, however, resume our discussion from the point at which 
<A NAME="127"></A>we digressed. To judge from the lives that men lead, most men, and men 
<A NAME="128"></A>of the most vulgar type, seem (not without some ground) to identify the 
<A NAME="129"></A>good, or happiness, with pleasure; which is the reason why they love the 
<A NAME="130"></A>life of enjoyment. For there are, we may say, three prominent types of 
<A NAME="131"></A>life- that just mentioned, the political, and thirdly the contemplative 
<A NAME="132"></A>life. Now the mass of mankind are evidently quite slavish in their tastes, 
<A NAME="133"></A>preferring a life suitable to beasts, but they get some ground for their 
<A NAME="134"></A>view from the fact that many of those in high places share the tastes of 
<A NAME="135"></A>Sardanapallus. A consideration of the prominent types of life shows that 
<A NAME="136"></A>people of superior refinement and of active disposition identify happiness 
<A NAME="137"></A>with honour; for this is, roughly speaking, the end of the political life. 
<A NAME="138"></A>But it seems too superficial to be what we are looking for, since it is 
<A NAME="139"></A>thought to depend on those who bestow honour rather than on him who receives 
<A NAME="140"></A>it, but the good we divine to be something proper to a man and not easily 
<A NAME="141"></A>taken from him. Further, men seem to pursue honour in order that they may 
<A NAME="142"></A>be assured of their goodness; at least it is by men of practical wisdom 
<A NAME="143"></A>that they seek to be honoured, and among those who know them, and on the 
<A NAME="144"></A>ground of their virtue; clearly, then, according to them, at any rate, 
<A NAME="145"></A>virtue is better. And perhaps one might even suppose this to be, rather 
<A NAME="146"></A>than honour, the end of the political life. But even this appears somewhat 
<A NAME="147"></A>incomplete; for possession of virtue seems actually compatible with being 
<A NAME="148"></A>asleep, or with lifelong inactivity, and, further, with the greatest sufferings 
<A NAME="149"></A>and misfortunes; but a man who was living so no one would call happy, unless 
<A NAME="150"></A>he were maintaining a thesis at all costs. But enough of this; for the 
<A NAME="151"></A>subject has been sufficiently treated even in the current discussions. 
<A NAME="152"></A>Third comes the contemplative life, which we shall consider 
<A NAME="153"></A>later.
<A NAME="154"></A><BR><BR>The life of money-making is one undertaken under compulsion, and 
<A NAME="155"></A>wealth is evidently not the good we are seeking; for it is merely useful 
<A NAME="156"></A>and for the sake of something else. And so one might rather take the aforenamed 
<A NAME="157"></A>objects to be ends; for they are loved for themselves. But it is evident 
<A NAME="158"></A>that not even these are ends; yet many arguments have been thrown away 
<A NAME="159"></A>in support of them. Let us leave this subject, then.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>6
<A NAME="161"></A><BR><BR>We had perhaps better consider the universal good and discuss thoroughly 
<A NAME="162"></A>what is meant by it, although such an inquiry is made an uphill one by 
<A NAME="163"></A>the fact that the Forms have been introduced by friends of our own. Yet 
<A NAME="164"></A>it would perhaps be thought to be better, indeed to be our duty, for the 
<A NAME="165"></A>sake of maintaining the truth even to destroy what touches us closely, 
<A NAME="166"></A>especially as we are philosophers or lovers of wisdom; for, while both 
<A NAME="167"></A>are dear, piety requires us to honour truth above our 
<A NAME="168"></A>friends.
<A NAME="169"></A><BR><BR>The men who introduced this doctrine did not posit Ideas of classes 
<A NAME="170"></A>within which they recognized priority and posteriority (which is the reason 
<A NAME="171"></A>why they did not maintain the existence of an Idea embracing all numbers); 
<A NAME="172"></A>but the term 'good' is used both in the category of substance and in that 
<A NAME="173"></A>of quality and in that of relation, and that which is per se, i.e. substance, 
<A NAME="174"></A>is prior in nature to the relative (for the latter is like an off shoot 
<A NAME="175"></A>and accident of being); so that there could not be a common Idea set over 
<A NAME="176"></A>all these goods. Further, since 'good' has as many senses as 'being' (for 
<A NAME="177"></A>it is predicated both in the category of substance, as of God and of reason, 
<A NAME="178"></A>and in quality, i.e. of the virtues, and in quantity, i.e. of that which 
<A NAME="179"></A>is moderate, and in relation, i.e. of the useful, and in time, i.e. of 
<A NAME="180"></A>the right opportunity, and in place, i.e. of the right locality and the 
<A NAME="181"></A>like), clearly it cannot be something universally present in all cases 
<A NAME="182"></A>and single; for then it could not have been predicated in all the categories 
<A NAME="183"></A>but in one only. Further, since of the things answering to one Idea there 
<A NAME="184"></A>is one science, there would have been one science of all the goods; but 
<A NAME="185"></A>as it is there are many sciences even of the things that fall under one 
<A NAME="186"></A>category, e.g. of opportunity, for opportunity in war is studied by strategics 
<A NAME="187"></A>and in disease by medicine, and the moderate in food is studied by medicine 
<A NAME="188"></A>and in exercise by the science of gymnastics. And one might ask the question, 
<A NAME="189"></A>what in the world they mean by 'a thing itself', is (as is the case) in 
<A NAME="190"></A>'man himself' and in a particular man the account of man is one and the 
<A NAME="191"></A>same. For in so far as they are man, they will in no respect differ; and 
<A NAME="192"></A>if this is so, neither will 'good itself' and particular goods, in so far 
<A NAME="193"></A>as they are good. But again it will not be good any the more for being 
<A NAME="194"></A>eternal, since that which lasts long is no whiter than that which perishes 
<A NAME="195"></A>in a day. The Pythagoreans seem to give a more plausible account of the 
<A NAME="196"></A>good, when they place the one in the column of goods; and it is they that 
<A NAME="197"></A>Speusippus seems to have followed.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>But let us discuss these matters elsewhere; an objection to what 
<A NAME="199"></A>we have said, however, may be discerned in the fact that the Platonists 
<A NAME="200"></A>have not been speaking about all goods, and that the goods that are pursued 
<A NAME="201"></A>and loved for themselves are called good by reference to a single Form, 
<A NAME="202"></A>while those which tend to produce or to preserve these somehow or to prevent 
<A NAME="203"></A>their contraries are called so by reference to these, and in a secondary 
<A NAME="204"></A>sense. Clearly, then, goods must be spoken of in two ways, and some must 
<A NAME="205"></A>be good in themselves, the others by reason of these. Let us separate, 
<A NAME="206"></A>then, things good in themselves from things useful, and consider whether 
<A NAME="207"></A>the former are called good by reference to a single Idea. What sort of 
<A NAME="208"></A>goods would one call good in themselves? Is it those that are pursued even 
<A NAME="209"></A>when isolated from others, such as intelligence, sight, and certain pleasures 
<A NAME="210"></A>and honours? Certainly, if we pursue these also for the sake of something 
<A NAME="211"></A>else, yet one would place them among things good in themselves. Or is nothing 
<A NAME="212"></A>other than the Idea of good good in itself? In that case the Form will 
<A NAME="213"></A>be empty. But if the things we have named are also things good in themselves, 
<A NAME="214"></A>the account of the good will have to appear as something identical in them 
<A NAME="215"></A>all, as that of whiteness is identical in snow and in white lead. But of 
<A NAME="216"></A>honour, wisdom, and pleasure, just in respect of their goodness, the accounts 
<A NAME="217"></A>are distinct and diverse. The good, therefore, is not some common element 
<A NAME="218"></A>answering to one Idea.
<A NAME="219"></A><BR><BR>But what then do we mean by the good? It is surely not like the 
<A NAME="220"></A>things that only chance to have the same name. Are goods one, then, by 
<A NAME="221"></A>being derived from one good or by all contributing to one good, or are 
<A NAME="222"></A>they rather one by analogy? Certainly as sight is in the body, so is reason 
<A NAME="223"></A>in the soul, and so on in other cases. But perhaps these subjects had better 
<A NAME="224"></A>be dismissed for the present; for perfect precision about them would be 
<A NAME="225"></A>more appropriate to another branch of philosophy. And similarly with regard 
<A NAME="226"></A>to the Idea; even if there is some one good which is universally predicable 
<A NAME="227"></A>of goods or is capable of separate and independent existence, clearly it 
<A NAME="228"></A>could not be achieved or attained by man; but we are now seeking something 
<A NAME="229"></A>attainable. Perhaps, however, some one might think it worth while to recognize 
<A NAME="230"></A>this with a view to the goods that are attainable and achievable; for having 
<A NAME="231"></A>this as a sort of pattern we shall know better the goods that are good 
<A NAME="232"></A>for us, and if we know them shall attain them. This argument has some plausibility, 
<A NAME="233"></A>but seems to clash with the procedure of the sciences; for all of these, 
<A NAME="234"></A>though they aim at some good and seek to supply the deficiency of it, leave 
<A NAME="235"></A>on one side the knowledge of the good. Yet that all the exponents of the 
<A NAME="236"></A>arts should be ignorant of, and should not even seek, so great an aid is 
<A NAME="237"></A>not probable. It is hard, too, to see how a weaver or a carpenter will 
<A NAME="238"></A>be benefited in regard to his own craft by knowing this 'good itself', 
<A NAME="239"></A>or how the man who has viewed the Idea itself will be a better doctor or 
<A NAME="240"></A>general thereby. For a doctor seems not even to study health in this way, 
<A NAME="241"></A>but the health of man, or perhaps rather the health of a particular man; 
<A NAME="242"></A>it is individuals that he is healing. But enough of these 
<A NAME="243"></A>topics.
<A NAME="244"></A><BR><BR>7
<A NAME="245"></A><BR><BR>Let us again return to the good we are seeking, and ask what it 
<A NAME="246"></A>can be. It seems different in different actions and arts; it is different 
<A NAME="247"></A>in medicine, in strategy, and in the other arts likewise. What then is 
<A NAME="248"></A>the good of each? Surely that for whose sake everything else is done. In 
<A NAME="249"></A>medicine this is health, in strategy victory, in architecture a house, 
<A NAME="250"></A>in any other sphere something else, and in every action and pursuit the 
<A NAME="251"></A>end; for it is for the sake of this that all men do whatever else they 
<A NAME="252"></A>do. Therefore, if there is an end for all that we do, this will be the 
<A NAME="253"></A>good achievable by action, and if there are more than one, these will be 
<A NAME="254"></A>the goods achievable by action.
<A NAME="255"></A><BR><BR>So the argument has by a different course reached the same point; 
<A NAME="256"></A>but we must try to state this even more clearly. Since there are evidently 
<A NAME="257"></A>more than one end, and we choose some of these (e.g. wealth, flutes, and 
<A NAME="258"></A>in general instruments) for the sake of something else, clearly not all 
<A NAME="259"></A>ends are final ends; but the chief good is evidently something final. Therefore, 
<A NAME="260"></A>if there is only one final end, this will be what we are seeking, and if 
<A NAME="261"></A>there are more than one, the most final of these will be what we are seeking. 
<A NAME="262"></A>Now we call that which is in itself worthy of pursuit more final than that 
<A NAME="263"></A>which is worthy of pursuit for the sake of something else, and that which 
<A NAME="264"></A>is never desirable for the sake of something else more final than the things 
<A NAME="265"></A>that are desirable both in themselves and for the sake of that other thing, 
<A NAME="266"></A>and therefore we call final without qualification that which is always 
<A NAME="267"></A>desirable in itself and never for the sake of something 
<A NAME="268"></A>else.
<A NAME="269"></A><BR><BR>Now such a thing happiness, above all else, is held to be; for 
<A NAME="270"></A>this we choose always for self and never for the sake of something else, 
<A NAME="271"></A>but honour, pleasure, reason, and every virtue we choose indeed for themselves 
<A NAME="272"></A>(for if nothing resulted from them we should still choose each of them), 
<A NAME="273"></A>but we choose them also for the sake of happiness, judging that by means 
<A NAME="274"></A>of them we shall be happy. Happiness, on the other hand, no one chooses 
<A NAME="275"></A>for the sake of these, nor, in general, for anything other than 
<A NAME="276"></A>itself.
<A NAME="277"></A><BR><BR>From the point of view of self-sufficiency the same result seems 
<A NAME="278"></A>to follow; for the final good is thought to be self-sufficient. Now by 
<A NAME="279"></A>self-sufficient we do not mean that which is sufficient for a man by himself, 
<A NAME="280"></A>for one who lives a solitary life, but also for parents, children, wife, 
<A NAME="281"></A>and in general for his friends and fellow citizens, since man is born for 
<A NAME="282"></A>citizenship. But some limit must be set to this; for if we extend our requirement 
<A NAME="283"></A>to ancestors and descendants and friends' friends we are in for an infinite 
<A NAME="284"></A>series. Let us examine this question, however, on another occasion; the 
<A NAME="285"></A>self-sufficient we now define as that which when isolated makes life desirable 
<A NAME="286"></A>and lacking in nothing; and such we think happiness to be; and further 
<A NAME="287"></A>we think it most desirable of all things, without being counted as one 
<A NAME="288"></A>good thing among others- if it were so counted it would clearly be made 
<A NAME="289"></A>more desirable by the addition of even the least of goods; for that which 
<A NAME="290"></A>is added becomes an excess of goods, and of goods the greater is always 
<A NAME="291"></A>more desirable. Happiness, then, is something final and self-sufficient, 
<A NAME="292"></A>and is the end of action.
<A NAME="293"></A><BR><BR>Presumably, however, to say that happiness is the chief good seems 
<A NAME="294"></A>a platitude, and a clearer account of what it is still desired. This might 
<A NAME="295"></A>perhaps be given, if we could first ascertain the function of man. For 
<A NAME="296"></A>just as for a flute-player, a sculptor, or an artist, and, in general, 
<A NAME="297"></A>for all things that have a function or activity, the good and the 'well' 
<A NAME="298"></A>is thought to reside in the function, so would it seem to be for man, if 
<A NAME="299"></A>he has a function. Have the carpenter, then, and the tanner certain functions 
<A NAME="300"></A>or activities, and has man none? Is he born without a function? Or as eye, 
<A NAME="301"></A>hand, foot, and in general each of the parts evidently has a function, 
<A NAME="302"></A>may one lay it down that man similarly has a function apart from all these? 
<A NAME="303"></A>What then can this be? Life seems to be common even to plants, but we are 
<A NAME="304"></A>seeking what is peculiar to man. Let us exclude, therefore, the life of 
<A NAME="305"></A>nutrition and growth. Next there would be a life of perception, but it 
<A NAME="306"></A>also seems to be common even to the horse, the ox, and every animal. There 
<A NAME="307"></A>remains, then, an active life of the element that has a rational principle; 
<A NAME="308"></A>of this, one part has such a principle in the sense of being obedient to 
<A NAME="309"></A>one, the other in the sense of possessing one and exercising thought. And, 
<A NAME="310"></A>as 'life of the rational element' also has two meanings, we must state 
<A NAME="311"></A>that life in the sense of activity is what we mean; for this seems to be 
<A NAME="312"></A>the more proper sense of the term. Now if the function of man is an activity 
<A NAME="313"></A>of soul which follows or implies a rational principle, and if we say 'so-and-so-and 
<A NAME="314"></A>'a good so-and-so' have a function which is the same in kind, e.g. a lyre, 
<A NAME="315"></A>and a good lyre-player, and so without qualification in all cases, eminence 
<A NAME="316"></A>in respect of goodness being idded to the name of the function (for the 
<A NAME="317"></A>function of a lyre-player is to play the lyre, and that of a good lyre-player 
<A NAME="318"></A>is to do so well): if this is the case, and we state the function of man 
<A NAME="319"></A>to be a certain kind of life, and this to be an activity or actions of 
<A NAME="320"></A>the soul implying a rational principle, and the function of a good man 
<A NAME="321"></A>to be the good and noble performance of these, and if any action is well 
<A NAME="322"></A>performed when it is performed in accordance with the appropriate excellence: 
<A NAME="323"></A>if this is the case, human good turns out to be activity of soul in accordance 
<A NAME="324"></A>with virtue, and if there are more than one virtue, in accordance with 
<A NAME="325"></A>the best and most complete.
<A NAME="326"></A><BR><BR>But we must add 'in a complete life.' For one swallow does not 
<A NAME="327"></A>make a summer, nor does one day; and so too one day, or a short time, does 
<A NAME="328"></A>not make a man blessed and happy.
<A NAME="329"></A><BR><BR>Let this serve as an outline of the good; for we must presumably 
<A NAME="330"></A>first sketch it roughly, and then later fill in the details. But it would 
<A NAME="331"></A>seem that any one is capable of carrying on and articulating what has once 
<A NAME="332"></A>been well outlined, and that time is a good discoverer or partner in such 
<A NAME="333"></A>a work; to which facts the advances of the arts are due; for any one can 
<A NAME="334"></A>add what is lacking. And we must also remember what has been said before, 
<A NAME="335"></A>and not look for precision in all things alike, but in each class of things 
<A NAME="336"></A>such precision as accords with the subject-matter, and so much as is appropriate 
<A NAME="337"></A>to the inquiry. For a carpenter and a geometer investigate the right angle 
<A NAME="338"></A>in different ways; the former does so in so far as the right angle is useful 
<A NAME="339"></A>for his work, while the latter inquires what it is or what sort of thing 
<A NAME="340"></A>it is; for he is a spectator of the truth. We must act in the same way, 
<A NAME="341"></A>then, in all other matters as well, that our main task may not be subordinated 
<A NAME="342"></A>to minor questions. Nor must we demand the cause in all matters alike; 
<A NAME="343"></A>it is enough in some cases that the fact be well established, as in the 
<A NAME="344"></A>case of the first principles; the fact is the primary thing or first principle. 
<A NAME="345"></A>Now of first principles we see some by induction, some by perception, some 
<A NAME="346"></A>by a certain habituation, and others too in other ways. But each set of 
<A NAME="347"></A>principles we must try to investigate in the natural way, and we must take 
<A NAME="348"></A>pains to state them definitely, since they have a great influence on what 
<A NAME="349"></A>follows. For the beginning is thought to be more than half of the whole, 
<A NAME="350"></A>and many of the questions we ask are cleared up by it.
<A NAME="351"></A><BR><BR>8
<A NAME="352"></A><BR><BR>We must consider it, however, in the light not only of our conclusion 
<A NAME="353"></A>and our premisses, but also of what is commonly said about it; for with 
<A NAME="354"></A>a true view all the data harmonize, but with a false one the facts soon 
<A NAME="355"></A>clash. Now goods have been divided into three classes, and some are described 
<A NAME="356"></A>as external, others as relating to soul or to body; we call those that 
<A NAME="357"></A>relate to soul most properly and truly goods, and psychical actions and 
<A NAME="358"></A>activities we class as relating to soul. Therefore our account must be 
<A NAME="359"></A>sound, at least according to this view, which is an old one and agreed 
<A NAME="360"></A>on by philosophers. It is correct also in that we identify the end with 
<A NAME="361"></A>certain actions and activities; for thus it falls among goods of the soul 
<A NAME="362"></A>and not among external goods. Another belief which harmonizes with our 
<A NAME="363"></A>account is that the happy man lives well and does well; for we have practically 
<A NAME="364"></A>defined happiness as a sort of good life and good action. The characteristics 
<A NAME="365"></A>that are looked for in happiness seem also, all of them, to belong to what 
<A NAME="366"></A>we have defined happiness as being. For some identify happiness with virtue, 
<A NAME="367"></A>some with practical wisdom, others with a kind of philosophic wisdom, others 
<A NAME="368"></A>with these, or one of these, accompanied by pleasure or not without pleasure; 
<A NAME="369"></A>while others include also external prosperity. Now some of these views 
<A NAME="370"></A>have been held by many men and men of old, others by a few eminent persons; 
<A NAME="371"></A>and it is not probable that either of these should be entirely mistaken, 
<A NAME="372"></A>but rather that they should be right in at least some one respect or even 
<A NAME="373"></A>in most respects.
<A NAME="374"></A><BR><BR>With those who identify happiness with virtue or some one virtue 
<A NAME="375"></A>our account is in harmony; for to virtue belongs virtuous activity. But 
<A NAME="376"></A>it makes, perhaps, no small difference whether we place the chief good 
<A NAME="377"></A>in possession or in use, in state of mind or in activity. For the state 
<A NAME="378"></A>of mind may exist without producing any good result, as in a man who is 
<A NAME="379"></A>asleep or in some other way quite inactive, but the activity cannot; for 
<A NAME="380"></A>one who has the activity will of necessity be acting, and acting well. 
<A NAME="381"></A>And as in the Olympic Games it is not the most beautiful and the strongest 
<A NAME="382"></A>that are crowned but those who compete (for it is some of these that are 
<A NAME="383"></A>victorious), so those who act win, and rightly win, the noble and good 
<A NAME="384"></A>things in life.
<A NAME="385"></A><BR><BR>Their life is also in itself pleasant. For pleasure is a state 
<A NAME="386"></A>of soul, and to each man that which he is said to be a lover of is pleasant; 
<A NAME="387"></A>e.g. not only is a horse pleasant to the lover of horses, and a spectacle 
<A NAME="388"></A>to the lover of sights, but also in the same way just acts are pleasant 
<A NAME="389"></A>to the lover of justice and in general virtuous acts to the lover of virtue. 
<A NAME="390"></A>Now for most men their pleasures are in conflict with one another because 
<A NAME="391"></A>these are not by nature pleasant, but the lovers of what is noble find 
<A NAME="392"></A>pleasant the things that are by nature pleasant; and virtuous actions are 
<A NAME="393"></A>such, so that these are pleasant for such men as well as in their own nature. 
<A NAME="394"></A>Their life, therefore, has no further need of pleasure as a sort of adventitious 
<A NAME="395"></A>charm, but has its pleasure in itself. For, besides what we have said, 
<A NAME="396"></A>the man who does not rejoice in noble actions is not even good; since no 
<A NAME="397"></A>one would call a man just who did not enjoy acting justly, nor any man 
<A NAME="398"></A>liberal who did not enjoy liberal actions; and similarly in all other cases. 
<A NAME="399"></A>If this is so, virtuous actions must be in themselves pleasant. But they 
<A NAME="400"></A>are also good and noble, and have each of these attributes in the highest 
<A NAME="401"></A>degree, since the good man judges well about these attributes; his judgement 
<A NAME="402"></A>is such as we have described. Happiness then is the best, noblest, and 
<A NAME="403"></A>most pleasant thing in the world, and these attributes are not severed 
<A NAME="404"></A>as in the inscription at Delos-
<A NAME="405"></A><BR><BR>Most noble is that which is justest, and best is 
<A NAME="406"></A>health;
<A NAME="407"></A><BR>But pleasantest is it to win what we love.
<A NAME="408"></A><BR><BR>For all these properties belong to the best activities; and these, 
<A NAME="409"></A>or one- the best- of these, we identify with happiness.
<A NAME="410"></A><BR><BR>Yet evidently, as we said, it needs the external goods as well; 
<A NAME="411"></A>for it is impossible, or not easy, to do noble acts without the proper 
<A NAME="412"></A>equipment. In many actions we use friends and riches and political power 
<A NAME="413"></A>as instruments; and there are some things the lack of which takes the lustre 
<A NAME="414"></A>from happiness, as good birth, goodly children, beauty; for the man who 
<A NAME="415"></A>is very ugly in appearance or ill-born or solitary and childless is not 
<A NAME="416"></A>very likely to be happy, and perhaps a man would be still less likely if 
<A NAME="417"></A>he had thoroughly bad children or friends or had lost good children or 
<A NAME="418"></A>friends by death. As we said, then, happiness seems to need this sort of 
<A NAME="419"></A>prosperity in addition; for which reason some identify happiness with good 
<A NAME="420"></A>fortune, though others identify it with virtue.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>9
<A NAME="422"></A><BR><BR>For this reason also the question is asked, whether happiness is 
<A NAME="423"></A>to be acquired by learning or by habituation or some other sort of training, 
<A NAME="424"></A>or comes in virtue of some divine providence or again by chance. Now if 
<A NAME="425"></A>there is any gift of the gods to men, it is reasonable that happiness should 
<A NAME="426"></A>be god-given, and most surely god-given of all human things inasmuch as 
<A NAME="427"></A>it is the best. But this question would perhaps be more appropriate to 
<A NAME="428"></A>another inquiry; happiness seems, however, even if it is not god-sent but 
<A NAME="429"></A>comes as a result of virtue and some process of learning or training, to 
<A NAME="430"></A>be among the most godlike things; for that which is the prize and end of 
<A NAME="431"></A>virtue seems to be the best thing in the world, and something godlike and 
<A NAME="432"></A>blessed.
<A NAME="433"></A><BR><BR>It will also on this view be very generally shared; for all who 
<A NAME="434"></A>are not maimed as regards their potentiality for virtue may win it by a 
<A NAME="435"></A>certain kind of study and care. But if it is better to be happy thus than 
<A NAME="436"></A>by chance, it is reasonable that the facts should be so, since everything 
<A NAME="437"></A>that depends on the action of nature is by nature as good as it can be, 
<A NAME="438"></A>and similarly everything that depends on art or any rational cause, and 
<A NAME="439"></A>especially if it depends on the best of all causes. To entrust to chance 
<A NAME="440"></A>what is greatest and most noble would be a very defective 
<A NAME="441"></A>arrangement.
<A NAME="442"></A><BR><BR>The answer to the question we are asking is plain also from the 
<A NAME="443"></A>definition of happiness; for it has been said to be a virtuous activity 
<A NAME="444"></A>of soul, of a certain kind. Of the remaining goods, some must necessarily 
<A NAME="445"></A>pre-exist as conditions of happiness, and others are naturally co-operative 
<A NAME="446"></A>and useful as instruments. And this will be found to agree with what we 
<A NAME="447"></A>said at the outset; for we stated the end of political science to be the 
<A NAME="448"></A>best end, and political science spends most of its pains on making the 
<A NAME="449"></A>citizens to be of a certain character, viz. good and capable of noble 
<A NAME="450"></A>acts.
<A NAME="451"></A><BR><BR>It is natural, then, that we call neither ox nor horse nor any 
<A NAME="452"></A>other of the animals happy; for none of them is capable of sharing in such 
<A NAME="453"></A>activity. For this reason also a boy is not happy; for he is not yet capable 
<A NAME="454"></A>of such acts, owing to his age; and boys who are called happy are being 
<A NAME="455"></A>congratulated by reason of the hopes we have for them. For there is required, 
<A NAME="456"></A>as we said, not only complete virtue but also a complete life, since many 
<A NAME="457"></A>changes occur in life, and all manner of chances, and the most prosperous 
<A NAME="458"></A>may fall into great misfortunes in old age, as is told of Priam in the 
<A NAME="459"></A>Trojan Cycle; and one who has experienced such chances and has ended wretchedly 
<A NAME="460"></A>no one calls happy.
<A NAME="461"></A><BR><BR>10
<A NAME="462"></A><BR><BR>Must no one at all, then, be called happy while he lives; must 
<A NAME="463"></A>we, as Solon says, see the end? Even if we are to lay down this doctrine, 
<A NAME="464"></A>is it also the case that a man is happy when he is dead? Or is not this 
<A NAME="465"></A>quite absurd, especially for us who say that happiness is an activity? 
<A NAME="466"></A>But if we do not call the dead man happy, and if Solon does not mean this, 
<A NAME="467"></A>but that one can then safely call a man blessed as being at last beyond 
<A NAME="468"></A>evils and misfortunes, this also affords matter for discussion; for both 
<A NAME="469"></A>evil and good are thought to exist for a dead man, as much as for one who 
<A NAME="470"></A>is alive but not aware of them; e.g. honours and dishonours and the good 
<A NAME="471"></A>or bad fortunes of children and in general of descendants. And this also 
<A NAME="472"></A>presents a problem; for though a man has lived happily up to old age and 
<A NAME="473"></A>has had a death worthy of his life, many reverses may befall his descendants- 
<A NAME="474"></A>some of them may be good and attain the life they deserve, while with others 
<A NAME="475"></A>the opposite may be the case; and clearly too the degrees of relationship 
<A NAME="476"></A>between them and their ancestors may vary indefinitely. It would be odd, 
<A NAME="477"></A>then, if the dead man were to share in these changes and become at one 
<A NAME="478"></A>time happy, at another wretched; while it would also be odd if the fortunes 
<A NAME="479"></A>of the descendants did not for some time have some effect on the happiness 
<A NAME="480"></A>of their ancestors.
<A NAME="481"></A><BR><BR>But we must return to our first difficulty; for perhaps by a consideration 
<A NAME="482"></A>of it our present problem might be solved. Now if we must see the end and 
<A NAME="483"></A>only then call a man happy, not as being happy but as having been so before, 
<A NAME="484"></A>surely this is a paradox, that when he is happy the attribute that belongs 
<A NAME="485"></A>to him is not to be truly predicated of him because we do not wish to call 
<A NAME="486"></A>living men happy, on account of the changes that may befall them, and because 
<A NAME="487"></A>we have assumed happiness to be something permanent and by no means easily 
<A NAME="488"></A>changed, while a single man may suffer many turns of fortune's wheel. For 
<A NAME="489"></A>clearly if we were to keep pace with his fortunes, we should often call 
<A NAME="490"></A>the same man happy and again wretched, making the happy man out to be chameleon 
<A NAME="491"></A>and insecurely based. Or is this keeping pace with his fortunes quite wrong? 
<A NAME="492"></A>Success or failure in life does not depend on these, but human life, as 
<A NAME="493"></A>we said, needs these as mere additions, while virtuous activities or their 
<A NAME="494"></A>opposites are what constitute happiness or the reverse.
<A NAME="495"></A><BR><BR>The question we have now discussed confirms our definition. For 
<A NAME="496"></A>no function of man has so much permanence as virtuous activities (these 
<A NAME="497"></A>are thought to be more durable even than knowledge of the sciences), and 
<A NAME="498"></A>of these themselves the most valuable are more durable because those who 
<A NAME="499"></A>are happy spend their life most readily and most continuously in these; 
<A NAME="500"></A>for this seems to be the reason why we do not forget them. The attribute 
<A NAME="501"></A>in question, then, will belong to the happy man, and he will be happy throughout 
<A NAME="502"></A>his life; for always, or by preference to everything else, he will be engaged 
<A NAME="503"></A>in virtuous action and contemplation, and he will bear the chances of life 
<A NAME="504"></A>most nobly and altogether decorously, if he is 'truly good' and 'foursquare 
<A NAME="505"></A>beyond reproach'.
<A NAME="506"></A><BR><BR>Now many events happen by chance, and events differing in importance; 
<A NAME="507"></A>small pieces of good fortune or of its opposite clearly do not weigh down 
<A NAME="508"></A>the scales of life one way or the other, but a multitude of great events 
<A NAME="509"></A>if they turn out well will make life happier (for not only are they themselves 
<A NAME="510"></A>such as to add beauty to life, but the way a man deals with them may be 
<A NAME="511"></A>noble and good), while if they turn out ill they crush and maim happiness; 
<A NAME="512"></A>for they both bring pain with them and hinder many activities. Yet even 
<A NAME="513"></A>in these nobility shines through, when a man bears with resignation many 
<A NAME="514"></A>great misfortunes, not through insensibility to pain but through nobility 
<A NAME="515"></A>and greatness of soul.
<A NAME="516"></A><BR><BR>If activities are, as we said, what gives life its character, no 
<A NAME="517"></A>happy man can become miserable; for he will never do the acts that are 
<A NAME="518"></A>hateful and mean. For the man who is truly good and wise, we think, bears 
<A NAME="519"></A>all the chances life becomingly and always makes the best of circumstances, 
<A NAME="520"></A>as a good general makes the best military use of the army at his command 
<A NAME="521"></A>and a good shoemaker makes the best shoes out of the hides that are given 
<A NAME="522"></A>him; and so with all other craftsmen. And if this is the case, the happy 
<A NAME="523"></A>man can never become miserable; though he will not reach blessedness, if 
<A NAME="524"></A>he meet with fortunes like those of Priam.
<A NAME="525"></A><BR><BR>Nor, again, is he many-coloured and changeable; for neither will 
<A NAME="526"></A>he be moved from his happy state easily or by any ordinary misadventures, 
<A NAME="527"></A>but only by many great ones, nor, if he has had many great misadventures, 
<A NAME="528"></A>will he recover his happiness in a short time, but if at all, only in a 
<A NAME="529"></A>long and complete one in which he has attained many splendid 
<A NAME="530"></A>successes.
<A NAME="531"></A><BR><BR>When then should we not say that he is happy who is active in accordance 
<A NAME="532"></A>with complete virtue and is sufficiently equipped with external goods, 
<A NAME="533"></A>not for some chance period but throughout a complete life? Or must we add 
<A NAME="534"></A>'and who is destined to live thus and die as befits his life'? Certainly 
<A NAME="535"></A>the future is obscure to us, while happiness, we claim, is an end and something 
<A NAME="536"></A>in every way final. If so, we shall call happy those among living men in 
<A NAME="537"></A>whom these conditions are, and are to be, fulfilled- but happy men. So 
<A NAME="538"></A>much for these questions.
<A NAME="539"></A><BR><BR>11
<A NAME="540"></A><BR><BR>That the fortunes of descendants and of all a man's friends should 
<A NAME="541"></A>not affect his happiness at all seems a very unfriendly doctrine, and one 
<A NAME="542"></A>opposed to the opinions men hold; but since the events that happen are 
<A NAME="543"></A>numerous and admit of all sorts of difference, and some come more near 
<A NAME="544"></A>to us and others less so, it seems a long- nay, an infinite- task to discuss 
<A NAME="545"></A>each in detail; a general outline will perhaps suffice. If, then, as some 
<A NAME="546"></A>of a man's own misadventures have a certain weight and influence on life 
<A NAME="547"></A>while others are, as it were, lighter, so too there are differences among 
<A NAME="548"></A>the misadventures of our friends taken as a whole, and it makes a difference 
<A NAME="549"></A>whether the various suffering befall the living or the dead (much more 
<A NAME="550"></A>even than whether lawless and terrible deeds are presupposed in a tragedy 
<A NAME="551"></A>or done on the stage), this difference also must be taken into account; 
<A NAME="552"></A>or rather, perhaps, the fact that doubt is felt whether the dead share 
<A NAME="553"></A>in any good or evil. For it seems, from these considerations, that even 
<A NAME="554"></A>if anything whether good or evil penetrates to them, it must be something 
<A NAME="555"></A>weak and negligible, either in itself or for them, or if not, at least 
<A NAME="556"></A>it must be such in degree and kind as not to make happy those who are not 
<A NAME="557"></A>happy nor to take away their blessedness from those who are. The good or 
<A NAME="558"></A>bad fortunes of friends, then, seem to have some effects on the dead, but 
<A NAME="559"></A>effects of such a kind and degree as neither to make the happy unhappy 
<A NAME="560"></A>nor to produce any other change of the kind.
<A NAME="561"></A><BR><BR>12
<A NAME="562"></A><BR><BR>These questions having been definitely answered, let us consider 
<A NAME="563"></A>whether happiness is among the things that are praised or rather among 
<A NAME="564"></A>the things that are prized; for clearly it is not to be placed among potentialities. 
<A NAME="565"></A>Everything that is praised seems to be praised because it is of a certain 
<A NAME="566"></A>kind and is related somehow to something else; for we praise the just or 
<A NAME="567"></A>brave man and in general both the good man and virtue itself because of 
<A NAME="568"></A>the actions and functions involved, and we praise the strong man, the good 
<A NAME="569"></A>runner, and so on, because he is of a certain kind and is related in a 
<A NAME="570"></A>certain way to something good and important. This is clear also from the 
<A NAME="571"></A>praises of the gods; for it seems absurd that the gods should be referred 
<A NAME="572"></A>to our standard, but this is done because praise involves a reference, 
<A NAME="573"></A>to something else. But if if praise is for things such as we have described, 
<A NAME="574"></A>clearly what applies to the best things is not praise, but something greater 
<A NAME="575"></A>and better, as is indeed obvious; for what we do to the gods and the most 
<A NAME="576"></A>godlike of men is to call them blessed and happy. And so too with good 
<A NAME="577"></A>things; no one praises happiness as he does justice, but rather calls it 
<A NAME="578"></A>blessed, as being something more divine and better.
<A NAME="579"></A><BR><BR>Eudoxus also seems to have been right in his method of advocating 
<A NAME="580"></A>the supremacy of pleasure; he thought that the fact that, though a good, 
<A NAME="581"></A>it is not praised indicated it to be better than the things that are praised, 
<A NAME="582"></A>and that this is what God and the good are; for by reference to these all 
<A NAME="583"></A>other things are judged. Praise is appropriate to virtue, for as a result 
<A NAME="584"></A>of virtue men tend to do noble deeds, but encomia are bestowed on acts, 
<A NAME="585"></A>whether of the body or of the soul. But perhaps nicety in these matters 
<A NAME="586"></A>is more proper to those who have made a study of encomia; to us it is clear 
<A NAME="587"></A>from what has been said that happiness is among the things that are prized 
<A NAME="588"></A>and perfect. It seems to be so also from the fact that it is a first principle; 
<A NAME="589"></A>for it is for the sake of this that we all do all that we do, and the first 
<A NAME="590"></A>principle and cause of goods is, we claim, something prized and 
<A NAME="591"></A>divine.
<A NAME="592"></A><BR><BR>13
<A NAME="593"></A><BR><BR>Since happiness is an activity of soul in accordance with perfect 
<A NAME="594"></A>virtue, we must consider the nature of virtue; for perhaps we shall thus 
<A NAME="595"></A>see better the nature of happiness. The true student of politics, too, 
<A NAME="596"></A>is thought to have studied virtue above all things; for he wishes to make 
<A NAME="597"></A>his fellow citizens good and obedient to the laws. As an example of this 
<A NAME="598"></A>we have the lawgivers of the Cretans and the Spartans, and any others of 
<A NAME="599"></A>the kind that there may have been. And if this inquiry belongs to political 
<A NAME="600"></A>science, clearly the pursuit of it will be in accordance with our original 
<A NAME="601"></A>plan. But clearly the virtue we must study is human virtue; for the good 
<A NAME="602"></A>we were seeking was human good and the happiness human happiness. By human 
<A NAME="603"></A>virtue we mean not that of the body but that of the soul; and happiness 
<A NAME="604"></A>also we call an activity of soul. But if this is so, clearly the student 
<A NAME="605"></A>of politics must know somehow the facts about soul, as the man who is to 
<A NAME="606"></A>heal the eyes or the body as a whole must know about the eyes or the body; 
<A NAME="607"></A>and all the more since politics is more prized and better than medicine; 
<A NAME="608"></A>but even among doctors the best educated spend much labour on acquiring 
<A NAME="609"></A>knowledge of the body. The student of politics, then, must study the soul, 
<A NAME="610"></A>and must study it with these objects in view, and do so just to the extent 
<A NAME="611"></A>which is sufficient for the questions we are discussing; for further precision 
<A NAME="612"></A>is perhaps something more laborious than our purposes 
<A NAME="613"></A>require.
<A NAME="614"></A><BR><BR>Some things are said about it, adequately enough, even in the discussions 
<A NAME="615"></A>outside our school, and we must use these; e.g. that one element in the 
<A NAME="616"></A>soul is irrational and one has a rational principle. Whether these are 
<A NAME="617"></A>separated as the parts of the body or of anything divisible are, or are 
<A NAME="618"></A>distinct by definition but by nature inseparable, like convex and concave 
<A NAME="619"></A>in the circumference of a circle, does not affect the present 
<A NAME="620"></A>question.
<A NAME="621"></A><BR><BR>Of the irrational element one division seems to be widely distributed, 
<A NAME="622"></A>and vegetative in its nature, I mean that which causes nutrition and growth; 
<A NAME="623"></A>for it is this kind of power of the soul that one must assign to all nurslings 
<A NAME="624"></A>and to embryos, and this same power to fullgrown creatures; this is more 
<A NAME="625"></A>reasonable than to assign some different power to them. Now the excellence 
<A NAME="626"></A>of this seems to be common to all species and not specifically human; for 
<A NAME="627"></A>this part or faculty seems to function most in sleep, while goodness and 
<A NAME="628"></A>badness are least manifest in sleep (whence comes the saying that the happy 
<A NAME="629"></A>are not better off than the wretched for half their lives; and this happens 
<A NAME="630"></A>naturally enough, since sleep is an inactivity of the soul in that respect 
<A NAME="631"></A>in which it is called good or bad), unless perhaps to a small extent some 
<A NAME="632"></A>of the movements actually penetrate to the soul, and in this respect the 
<A NAME="633"></A>dreams of good men are better than those of ordinary people. Enough of 
<A NAME="634"></A>this subject, however; let us leave the nutritive faculty alone, since 
<A NAME="635"></A>it has by its nature no share in human excellence.
<A NAME="636"></A><BR><BR>There seems to be also another irrational element in the soul-one 
<A NAME="637"></A>which in a sense, however, shares in a rational principle. For we praise 
<A NAME="638"></A>the rational principle of the continent man and of the incontinent, and 
<A NAME="639"></A>the part of their soul that has such a principle, since it urges them aright 
<A NAME="640"></A>and towards the best objects; but there is found in them also another element 
<A NAME="641"></A>naturally opposed to the rational principle, which fights against and resists 
<A NAME="642"></A>that principle. For exactly as paralysed limbs when we intend to move them 
<A NAME="643"></A>to the right turn on the contrary to the left, so is it with the soul; 
<A NAME="644"></A>the impulses of incontinent people move in contrary directions. But while 
<A NAME="645"></A>in the body we see that which moves astray, in the soul we do not. No doubt, 
<A NAME="646"></A>however, we must none the less suppose that in the soul too there is something 
<A NAME="647"></A>contrary to the rational principle, resisting and opposing it. In what 
<A NAME="648"></A>sense it is distinct from the other elements does not concern us. Now even 
<A NAME="649"></A>this seems to have a share in a rational principle, as we said; at any 
<A NAME="650"></A>rate in the continent man it obeys the rational principle and presumably 
<A NAME="651"></A>in the temperate and brave man it is still more obedient; for in him it 
<A NAME="652"></A>speaks, on all matters, with the same voice as the rational 
<A NAME="653"></A>principle.
<A NAME="654"></A><BR><BR>Therefore the irrational element also appears to be two-fold. For 
<A NAME="655"></A>the vegetative element in no way shares in a rational principle, but the 
<A NAME="656"></A>appetitive and in general the desiring element in a sense shares in it, 
<A NAME="657"></A>in so far as it listens to and obeys it; this is the sense in which we 
<A NAME="658"></A>speak of 'taking account' of one's father or one's friends, not that in 
<A NAME="659"></A>which we speak of 'accounting for a mathematical property. That the irrational 
<A NAME="660"></A>element is in some sense persuaded by a rational principle is indicated 
<A NAME="661"></A>also by the giving of advice and by all reproof and exhortation. And if 
<A NAME="662"></A>this element also must be said to have a rational principle, that which 
<A NAME="663"></A>has a rational principle (as well as that which has not) will be twofold, 
<A NAME="664"></A>one subdivision having it in the strict sense and in itself, and the other 
<A NAME="665"></A>having a tendency to obey as one does one's father.
<A NAME="666"></A><BR><BR>Virtue too is distinguished into kinds in accordance with this 
<A NAME="667"></A>difference; for we say that some of the virtues are intellectual and others 
<A NAME="668"></A>moral, philosophic wisdom and understanding and practical wisdom being 
<A NAME="669"></A>intellectual, liberality and temperance moral. For in speaking about a 
<A NAME="670"></A>man's character we do not say that he is wise or has understanding but 
<A NAME="671"></A>that he is good-tempered or temperate; yet we praise the wise man also 
<A NAME="672"></A>with respect to his state of mind; and of states of mind we call those 
<A NAME="673"></A>which merit praise virtues.
