<BR><BR>
<A NAME="11"></A>Moreover, to claim a 'Yes' or 'No' answer is the business not of a man 
<A NAME="12"></A>who is showing something, but of one who is holding an examination. For 
<A NAME="13"></A>the art of examining is a branch of dialectic and has in view not the man 
<A NAME="14"></A>who has knowledge, but the ignorant pretender. He, then, is a dialectician 
<A NAME="15"></A>who regards the common principles with their application to the particular 
<A NAME="16"></A>matter in hand, while he who only appears to do this is a sophist. Now 
<A NAME="17"></A>for contentious and sophistical reasoning: (1) one such is a merely apparent 
<A NAME="18"></A>reasoning, on subjects on which dialectical reasoning is the proper method 
<A NAME="19"></A>of examination, even though its conclusion be true: for it misleads us 
<A NAME="20"></A>in regard to the cause: also (2) there are those misreasonings which do 
<A NAME="21"></A>not conform to the line of inquiry proper to the particular subject, but 
<A NAME="22"></A>are generally thought to conform to the art in question. For false diagrams 
<A NAME="23"></A>of geometrical figures are not contentious (for the resulting fallacies 
<A NAME="24"></A>conform to the subject of the art)-any more than is any false diagram that 
<A NAME="25"></A>may be offered in proof of a truth-e.g. Hippocrates' figure or the squaring 
<A NAME="26"></A>of the circle by means of the lunules. But Bryson's method of squaring 
<A NAME="27"></A>the circle, even if the circle is thereby squared, is still sophistical 
<A NAME="28"></A>because it does not conform to the subject in hand. So, then, any merely 
<A NAME="29"></A>apparent reasoning about these things is a contentious argument, and any 
<A NAME="30"></A>reasoning that merely appears to conform to the subject in hand, even though 
<A NAME="31"></A>it be genuine reasoning, is a contentious argument: for it is merely apparent 
<A NAME="32"></A>in its conformity to the subject-matter, so that it is deceptive and plays 
<A NAME="33"></A>foul. For just as a foul in a race is a definite type of fault, and is 
<A NAME="34"></A>a kind of foul fighting, so the art of contentious reasoning is foul fighting 
<A NAME="35"></A>in disputation: for in the former case those who are resolved to win at 
<A NAME="36"></A>all costs snatch at everything, and so in the latter case do contentious 
<A NAME="37"></A>reasoners. Those, then, who do this in order to win the mere victory are 
<A NAME="38"></A>generally considered to be contentious and quarrelsome persons, while those 
<A NAME="39"></A>who do it to win a reputation with a view to making money are sophistical. 
<A NAME="40"></A>For the art of sophistry is, as we said,' a kind of art of money-making 
<A NAME="41"></A>from a merely apparent wisdom, and this is why they aim at a merely apparent 
<A NAME="42"></A>demonstration: and quarrelsome persons and sophists both employ the same 
<A NAME="43"></A>arguments, but not with the same motives: and the same argument will be 
<A NAME="44"></A>sophistical and contentious, but not in the same respect; rather, it will 
<A NAME="45"></A>be contentious in so far as its aim is an apparent victory, while in so 
<A NAME="46"></A>far as its aim is an apparent wisdom, it will be sophistical: for the art 
<A NAME="47"></A>of sophistry is a certain appearance of wisdom without the reality. The 
<A NAME="48"></A>contentious argument stands in somewhat the same relation to the dialectical 
<A NAME="49"></A>as the drawer of false diagrams to the geometrician; for it beguiles by 
<A NAME="50"></A>misreasoning from the same principles as dialectic uses, just as the drawer 
<A NAME="51"></A>of a false diagram beguiles the geometrician. But whereas the latter is 
<A NAME="52"></A>not a contentious reasoner, because he bases his false diagram on the principles 
<A NAME="53"></A>and conclusions that fall under the art of geometry, the argument which 
<A NAME="54"></A>is subordinate to the principles of dialectic will yet clearly be contentious 
<A NAME="55"></A>as regards other subjects. Thus, e.g. though the squaring of the circle 
<A NAME="56"></A>by means of the lunules is not contentious, Bryson's solution is contentious: 
<A NAME="57"></A>and the former argument cannot be adapted to any subject except geometry, 
<A NAME="58"></A>because it proceeds from principles that are peculiar to geometry, whereas 
<A NAME="59"></A>the latter can be adapted as an argument against all the number of people 
<A NAME="60"></A>who do not know what is or is not possible in each particular context: 
<A NAME="61"></A>for it will apply to them all. Or there is the method whereby Antiphon 
<A NAME="62"></A>squared the circle. Or again, an argument which denied that it was better 
<A NAME="63"></A>to take a walk after dinner, because of Zeno's argument, would not be a 
<A NAME="64"></A>proper argument for a doctor, because Zeno's argument is of general application. 
<A NAME="65"></A>If, then, the relation of the contentious argument to the dialectical were 
<A NAME="66"></A>exactly like that of the drawer of false diagrams to the geometrician, 
<A NAME="67"></A>a contentious argument upon the aforesaid subjects could not have existed. 
<A NAME="68"></A>But, as it is, the dialectical argument is not concerned with any definite 
<A NAME="69"></A>kind of being, nor does it show anything, nor is it even an argument such 
<A NAME="70"></A>as we find in the general philosophy of being. For all beings are not contained 
<A NAME="71"></A>in any one kind, nor, if they were, could they possibly fall under the 
<A NAME="72"></A>same principles. Accordingly, no art that is a method of showing the nature 
<A NAME="73"></A>of anything proceeds by asking questions: for it does not permit a man 
<A NAME="74"></A>to grant whichever he likes of the two alternatives in the question: for 
<A NAME="75"></A>they will not both of them yield a proof. Dialectic, on the other hand, 
<A NAME="76"></A>does proceed by questioning, whereas if it were concerned to show things, 
<A NAME="77"></A>it would have refrained from putting questions, even if not about everything, 
<A NAME="78"></A>at least about the first principles and the special principles that apply 
<A NAME="79"></A>to the particular subject in hand. For suppose the answerer not to grant 
<A NAME="80"></A>these, it would then no longer have had any grounds from which to argue 
<A NAME="81"></A>any longer against the objection. Dialectic is at the same time a mode 
<A NAME="82"></A>of examination as well. For neither is the art of examination an accomplishment 
<A NAME="83"></A>of the same kind as geometry, but one which a man may possess, even though 
<A NAME="84"></A>he has not knowledge. For it is possible even for one without knowledge 
<A NAME="85"></A>to hold an examination of one who is without knowledge, if also the latter 
<A NAME="86"></A>grants him points taken not from thing that he knows or from the special 
<A NAME="87"></A>principles of the subject under discussion but from all that range of consequences 
<A NAME="88"></A>attaching to the subject which a man may indeed know without knowing the 
<A NAME="89"></A>theory of the subject, but which if he do not know, he is bound to be ignorant 
<A NAME="90"></A>of the theory. So then clearly the art of examining does not consist in 
<A NAME="91"></A>knowledge of any definite subject. For this reason, too, it deals with 
<A NAME="92"></A>everything: for every 'theory' of anything employs also certain common 
<A NAME="93"></A>principles. Hence everybody, including even amateurs, makes use in a way 
<A NAME="94"></A>of dialectic and the practice of examining: for all undertake to some extent 
<A NAME="95"></A>a rough trial of those who profess to know things. What serves them here 
<A NAME="96"></A>is the general principles: for they know these of themselves just as well 
<A NAME="97"></A>as the scientist, even if in what they say they seem to the latter to go 
<A NAME="98"></A>wildly astray from them. All, then, are engaged in refutation; for they 
<A NAME="99"></A>take a hand as amateurs in the same task with which dialectic is concerned 
<A NAME="100"></A>professionally; and he is a dialectician who examines by the help of a 
<A NAME="101"></A>theory of reasoning. Now there are many identical principles which are 
<A NAME="102"></A>true of everything, though they are not such as to constitute a particular 
<A NAME="103"></A>nature, i.e. a particular kind of being, but are like negative terms, while 
<A NAME="104"></A>other principles are not of this kind but are special to particular subjects; 
<A NAME="105"></A>accordingly it is possible from these general principles to hold an examination 
<A NAME="106"></A>on everything, and that there should be a definite art of so doing, and, 
<A NAME="107"></A>moreover, an art which is not of the same kind as those which demonstrate. 
<A NAME="108"></A>This is why the contentious reasoner does not stand in the same condition 
<A NAME="109"></A>in all respects as the drawer of a false diagram: for the contentious reasoner 
<A NAME="110"></A>will not be given to misreasoning from any definite class of principles, 
<A NAME="111"></A>but will deal with every class.
<A NAME="112"></A><BR><BR>These, then, are the types of sophistical refutations: and that 
<A NAME="113"></A>it belongs to the dialectician to study these, and to be able to effect 
<A NAME="114"></A>them, is not difficult to see: for the investigation of premisses comprises 
<A NAME="115"></A>the whole of this study.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="116"></A><B>Part 12</B>

<A NAME="117"></A><BR><BR>So much, then, for apparent refutations. As for showing that the 
<A NAME="118"></A>answerer is committing some fallacy, and drawing his argument into paradox-for 
<A NAME="119"></A>this was the second item of the sophist's programme-in the first place, 
<A NAME="120"></A>then, this is best brought about by a certain manner of questioning and 
<A NAME="121"></A>through the question. For to put the question without framing it with reference 
<A NAME="122"></A>to any definite subject is a good bait for these purposes: for people are 
<A NAME="123"></A>more inclined to make mistakes when they talk at large, and they talk at 
<A NAME="124"></A>large when they have no definite subject before them. Also the putting 
<A NAME="125"></A>of several questions, even though the position against which one is arguing 
<A NAME="126"></A>be quite definite, and the claim that he shall say only what he thinks, 
<A NAME="127"></A>create abundant opportunity for drawing him into paradox or fallacy, and 
<A NAME="128"></A>also, whether to any of these questions he replies 'Yes' or replies 'No', 
<A NAME="129"></A>of leading him on to statements against which one is well off for a line 
<A NAME="130"></A>of attack. Nowadays, however, men are less able to play foul by these means 
<A NAME="131"></A>than they were formerly: for people rejoin with the question, 'What has 
<A NAME="132"></A>that to do with the original subject?' It is, too, an elementary rule for 
<A NAME="133"></A>eliciting some fallacy or paradox that one should never put a controversial 
<A NAME="134"></A>question straight away, but say that one puts it from the wish for information: 
<A NAME="135"></A>for the process of inquiry thus invited gives room for an 
<A NAME="136"></A>attack.
<A NAME="137"></A><BR><BR>A rule specially appropriate for showing up a fallacy is the sophistic 
<A NAME="138"></A>rule, that one should draw the answerer on to the kind of statements against 
<A NAME="139"></A>which one is well supplied with arguments: this can be done both properly 
<A NAME="140"></A>and improperly, as was said before.' Again, to draw a paradoxical statement, 
<A NAME="141"></A>look and see to what school of philosophers the person arguing with you 
<A NAME="142"></A>belongs, and then question him as to some point wherein their doctrine 
<A NAME="143"></A>is paradoxical to most people: for with every school there is some point 
<A NAME="144"></A>of that kind. It is an elementary rule in these matters to have a collection 
<A NAME="145"></A>of the special 'theses' of the various schools among your propositions. 
<A NAME="146"></A>The solution recommended as appropriate here, too, is to point out that 
<A NAME="147"></A>the paradox does not come about because of the argument: whereas this is 
<A NAME="148"></A>what his opponent always really wants.
<A NAME="149"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, argue from men's wishes and their professed opinions. 
<A NAME="150"></A>For people do not wish the same things as they say they wish: they say 
<A NAME="151"></A>what will look best, whereas they wish what appears to be to their interest: 
<A NAME="152"></A>e.g. they say that a man ought to die nobly rather than to live in pleasure, 
<A NAME="153"></A>and to live in honest poverty rather than in dishonourable riches; but 
<A NAME="154"></A>they wish the opposite. Accordingly, a man who speaks according to his 
<A NAME="155"></A>wishes must be led into stating the professed opinions of people, while 
<A NAME="156"></A>he who speaks according to these must be led into admitting those that 
<A NAME="157"></A>people keep hidden away: for in either case they are bound to introduce 
<A NAME="158"></A>a paradox; for they will speak contrary either to men's professed or to 
<A NAME="159"></A>their hidden opinions.
<A NAME="160"></A><BR><BR>The widest range of common-place argument for leading men into 
<A NAME="161"></A>paradoxical statement is that which depends on the standards of Nature 
<A NAME="162"></A>and of the Law: it is so that both Callicles is drawn as arguing in the 
<A NAME="163"></A>Gorgias, and that all the men of old supposed the result to come about: 
<A NAME="164"></A>for nature (they said) and law are opposites, and justice is a fine thing 
<A NAME="165"></A>by a legal standard, but not by that of nature. Accordingly, they said, 
<A NAME="166"></A>the man whose statement agrees with the standard of nature you should meet 
<A NAME="167"></A>by the standard of the law, but the man who agrees with the law by leading 
<A NAME="168"></A>him to the facts of nature: for in both ways paradoxical statements may 
<A NAME="169"></A>be committed. In their view the standard of nature was the truth, while 
<A NAME="170"></A>that of the law was the opinion held by the majority. So that it is clear 
<A NAME="171"></A>that they, too, used to try either to refute the answerer or to make him 
<A NAME="172"></A>make paradoxical statements, just as the men of to-day do as 
<A NAME="173"></A>well.
<A NAME="174"></A><BR><BR>Some questions are such that in both forms the answer is paradoxical; 
<A NAME="175"></A>e.g. 'Ought one to obey the wise or one's father?' and 'Ought one to do 
<A NAME="176"></A>what is expedient or what is just?' and 'Is it preferable to suffer injustice 
<A NAME="177"></A>or to do an injury?' You should lead people, then, into views opposite 
<A NAME="178"></A>to the majority and to the philosophers; if any one speaks as do the expert 
<A NAME="179"></A>reasoners, lead him into opposition to the majority, while if he speaks 
<A NAME="180"></A>as do the majority, then into opposition to the reasoners. For some say 
<A NAME="181"></A>that of necessity the happy man is just, whereas it is paradoxical to the 
<A NAME="182"></A>many that a king should be happy. To lead a man into paradoxes of this 
<A NAME="183"></A>sort is the same as to lead him into the opposition of the standards of 
<A NAME="184"></A>nature and law: for the law represents the opinion of the majority, whereas 
<A NAME="185"></A>philosophers speak according to the standard of nature and the 
<A NAME="186"></A>truth.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="187"></A><B>Part 13</B>

<A NAME="188"></A><BR><BR>Paradoxes, then, you should seek to elicit by means of these common-place 
<A NAME="189"></A>rules. Now as for making any one babble, we have already said what we mean 
<A NAME="190"></A>by 'to babble'. This is the object in view in all arguments of the following 
<A NAME="191"></A>kind: If it is all the same to state a term and to state its definition, 
<A NAME="192"></A>the 'double' and 'double of half' are the same: if then 'double' be the 
<A NAME="193"></A>'double of half', it will be the 'double of half of half'. And if, instead 
<A NAME="194"></A>of 'double', 'double of half' be again put, then the same expression will 
<A NAME="195"></A>be repeated three times, 'double of half of half of half'. Also 'desire 
<A NAME="196"></A>is of the pleasant, isn't it?' desire is conation for the pleasant: accordingly, 
<A NAME="197"></A>'desire' is 'conation for the pleasant for the pleasant'.
<A NAME="198"></A><BR><BR>All arguments of this kind occur in dealing (1) with any relative 
<A NAME="199"></A>terms which not only have relative genera, but are also themselves relative, 
<A NAME="200"></A>and are rendered in relation to one and the same thing, as e.g. conation 
<A NAME="201"></A>is conation for something, and desire is desire of something, and double 
<A NAME="202"></A>is double of something, i.e. double of half: also in dealing (2) with any 
<A NAME="203"></A>terms which, though they be not relative terms at all, yet have their substance, 
<A NAME="204"></A>viz. the things of which they are the states or affections or what not, 
<A NAME="205"></A>indicated as well in their definition, they being predicated of these things. 
<A NAME="206"></A>Thus e.g. 'odd' is a 'number containing a middle': but there is an 'odd 
<A NAME="207"></A>number': therefore there is a 'number-containing-a-middle number'. Also, 
<A NAME="208"></A>if snubness be a concavity of the nose, and there be a snub nose, there 
<A NAME="209"></A>is therefore a 'concave-nose nose'.
<A NAME="210"></A><BR><BR>People sometimes appear to produce this result, without really 
<A NAME="211"></A>producing it, because they do not add the question whether the expression 
<A NAME="212"></A>'double', just by itself, has any meaning or no, and if so, whether it 
<A NAME="213"></A>has the same meaning, or a different one; but they draw their conclusion 
<A NAME="214"></A>straight away. Still it seems, inasmuch as the word is the same, to have 
<A NAME="215"></A>the same meaning as well.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="216"></A><B>Part 14</B>

<A NAME="217"></A><BR><BR>We have said before what kind of thing 'solecism' is.' It is possible 
<A NAME="218"></A>both to commit it, and to seem to do so without doing so, and to do so 
<A NAME="219"></A>without seeming to do so. Suppose, as Protagoras used to say that menis 
<A NAME="220"></A>('wrath') and pelex ('helmet') are masculine: according to him a man who 
<A NAME="221"></A>calls wrath a 'destructress' (oulomenen) commits a solecism, though he 
<A NAME="222"></A>does not seem to do so to other people, where he who calls it a 'destructor' 
<A NAME="223"></A>(oulomenon) commits no solecism though he seems to do so. It is clear, 
<A NAME="224"></A>then, that any one could produce this effect by art as well: and for this 
<A NAME="225"></A>reason many arguments seem to lead to solecism which do not really do so, 
<A NAME="226"></A>as happens in the case of refutations.
<A NAME="227"></A><BR><BR>Almost all apparent solecisms depend upon the word 'this' (tode), 
<A NAME="228"></A>and upon occasions when the inflection denotes neither a masculine nor 
<A NAME="229"></A>a feminine object but a neuter. For 'he' (outos) signifies a masculine, 
<A NAME="230"></A>and 'she' (aute) feminine; but 'this' (touto), though meant to signify 
<A NAME="231"></A>a neuter, often also signifies one or other of the former: e.g. 'What is 
<A NAME="232"></A>this?' 'It is Calliope'; 'it is a log'; 'it is Coriscus'. Now in the masculine 
<A NAME="233"></A>and feminine the inflections are all different, whereas in the neuter some 
<A NAME="234"></A>are and some are not. Often, then, when 'this' (touto) has been granted, 
<A NAME="235"></A>people reason as if 'him' (touton) had been said: and likewise also they 
<A NAME="236"></A>substitute one inflection for another. The fallacy comes about because 
<A NAME="237"></A>'this' (touto) is a common form of several inflections: for 'this' signifies 
<A NAME="238"></A>sometimes 'he' (outos) and sometimes 'him' (touton). It should signify 
<A NAME="239"></A>them alternately; when combined with 'is' (esti) it should be 'he', while 
<A NAME="240"></A>with 'being' it should be 'him': e.g. 'Coriscus (Kopiskos) is', but 'being 
<A NAME="241"></A>Coriscus' (Kopiskon). It happens in the same way in the case of feminine 
<A NAME="242"></A>nouns as well, and in the case of the so-called 'chattels' that have feminine 
<A NAME="243"></A>or masculine designations. For only those names which end in o and n, have 
<A NAME="244"></A>the designation proper to a chattel, e.g. xulon ('log'), schoinion ('rope'); 
<A NAME="245"></A>those which do not end so have that of a masculine or feminine object, 
<A NAME="246"></A>though some of them we apply to chattels: e.g. askos ('wineskin') is a 
<A NAME="247"></A>masculine noun, and kline ('bed') a feminine. For this reason in cases 
<A NAME="248"></A>of this kind as well there will be a difference of the same sort between 
<A NAME="249"></A>a construction with 'is' (esti) or with 'being' (to einai). Also, Solecism 
<A NAME="250"></A>resembles in a certain way those refutations which are said to depend on 
<A NAME="251"></A>the like expression of unlike things. For, just as there we come upon a 
<A NAME="252"></A>material solecism, so here we come upon a verbal: for 'man' is both a 'matter' 
<A NAME="253"></A>for expression and also a 'word': and so is white'.
<A NAME="254"></A><BR><BR>It is clear, then, that for solecisms we must try to construct 
<A NAME="255"></A>our argument out of the aforesaid inflections.
<A NAME="256"></A><BR><BR>These, then, are the types of contentious arguments, and the subdivisions 
<A NAME="257"></A>of those types, and the methods for conducting them aforesaid. But it makes 
<A NAME="258"></A>no little difference if the materials for putting the question be arranged 
<A NAME="259"></A>in a certain manner with a view to concealment, as in the case of dialectics. 
<A NAME="260"></A>Following then upon what we have said, this must be discussed 
<A NAME="261"></A>first.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="262"></A><B>Part 15</B>

<A NAME="263"></A><BR><BR>With a view then to refutation, one resource is length-for it is 
<A NAME="264"></A>difficult to keep several things in view at once; and to secure length 
<A NAME="265"></A>the elementary rules that have been stated before' should be employed. 
<A NAME="266"></A>One resource, on the other hand, is speed; for when people are left behind 
<A NAME="267"></A>they look ahead less. Moreover, there is anger and contentiousness, for 
<A NAME="268"></A>when agitated everybody is less able to take care of himself. Elementary 
<A NAME="269"></A>rules for producing anger are to make a show of the wish to play foul, 
<A NAME="270"></A>and to be altogether shameless. Moreover, there is the putting of one's 
<A NAME="271"></A>questions alternately, whether one has more than one argument leading to 
<A NAME="272"></A>the same conclusion, or whether one has arguments to show both that something 
<A NAME="273"></A>is so, and that it is not so: for the result is that he has to be on his 
<A NAME="274"></A>guard at the same time either against more than one line, or against contrary 
<A NAME="275"></A>lines, of argument. In general, all the methods described before of producing 
<A NAME="276"></A>concealment are useful also for purposes of contentious argument: for the 
<A NAME="277"></A>object of concealment is to avoid detection, and the object of this is 
<A NAME="278"></A>to deceive.
<A NAME="279"></A><BR><BR>To counter those who refuse to grant whatever they suppose to help 
<A NAME="280"></A>one's argument, one should put the question negatively, as though desirous 
<A NAME="281"></A>of the opposite answer, or at any rate as though one put the question without 
<A NAME="282"></A>prejudice; for when it is obscure what answer one wants to secure, people 
<A NAME="283"></A>are less refractory. Also when, in dealing with particulars, a man grants 
<A NAME="284"></A>the individual case, when the induction is done you should often not put 
<A NAME="285"></A>the universal as a question, but take it for granted and use it: for sometimes 
<A NAME="286"></A>people themselves suppose that they have granted it, and also appear to 
<A NAME="287"></A>the audience to have done so, for they remember the induction and assume 
<A NAME="288"></A>that the questions could not have been put for nothing. In cases where 
<A NAME="289"></A>there is no term to indicate the universal, still you should avail yourself 
<A NAME="290"></A>of the resemblance of the particulars to suit your purpose; for resemblance 
<A NAME="291"></A>often escapes detection. Also, with a view to obtaining your premiss, you 
<A NAME="292"></A>ought to put it in your question side by side with its contrary. E.g. if 
<A NAME="293"></A>it were necessary to secure the admission that 'A man should obey his father 
<A NAME="294"></A>in everything', ask 'Should a man obey his parents in everything, or disobey 
<A NAME="295"></A>them in everything?'; and to secure that 'A number multiplied by a large 
<A NAME="296"></A>number is a large number', ask 'Should one agree that it is a large number 
<A NAME="297"></A>or a small one?' For then, if compelled to choose, one will be more inclined 
<A NAME="298"></A>to think it a large one: for the placing of their contraries close beside 
<A NAME="299"></A>them makes things look big to men, both relatively and absolutely, and 
<A NAME="300"></A>worse and better.
<A NAME="301"></A><BR><BR>A strong appearance of having been refuted is often produced by 
<A NAME="302"></A>the most highly sophistical of all the unfair tricks of questioners, when 
<A NAME="303"></A>without proving anything, instead of putting their final proposition as 
<A NAME="304"></A>a question, they state it as a conclusion, as though they had proved that 
<A NAME="305"></A>'Therefore so-and-so is not true'
<A NAME="306"></A><BR><BR>It is also a sophistical trick, when a paradox has been laid down, 
<A NAME="307"></A>first to propose at the start some view that is generally accepted, and 
<A NAME="308"></A>then claim that the answerer shall answer what he thinks about it, and 
<A NAME="309"></A>to put one's question on matters of that kind in the form 'Do you think 
<A NAME="310"></A>that...?' For then, if the question be taken as one of the premisses of 
<A NAME="311"></A>one's argument, either a refutation or a paradox is bound to result; if 
<A NAME="312"></A>he grants the view, a refutation; if he refuses to grant it or even to 
<A NAME="313"></A>admit it as the received opinion, a paradox; if he refuses to grant it, 
<A NAME="314"></A>but admits that it is the received opinion, something very like a refutation, 
<A NAME="315"></A>results.
<A NAME="316"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, just as in rhetorical discourses, so also in those aimed 
<A NAME="317"></A>at refutation, you should examine the discrepancies of the answerer's position 
<A NAME="318"></A>either with his own statements, or with those of persons whom he admits 
<A NAME="319"></A>to say and do aright, moreover with those of people who are generally supposed 
<A NAME="320"></A>to bear that kind of character, or who are like them, or with those of 
<A NAME="321"></A>the majority or of all men. Also just as answerers, too, often, when they 
<A NAME="322"></A>are in process of being confuted, draw a distinction, if their confutation 
<A NAME="323"></A>is just about to take place, so questioners also should resort to this 
<A NAME="324"></A>from time to time to counter objectors, pointing out, supposing that against 
<A NAME="325"></A>one sense of the words the objection holds, but not against the other, 
<A NAME="326"></A>that they have taken it in the latter sense, as e.g. Cleophon does in the 
<A NAME="327"></A>Mandrobulus. They should also break off their argument and cut down their 
<A NAME="328"></A>other lines of attack, while in answering, if a man perceives this being 
<A NAME="329"></A>done beforehand, he should put in his objection and have his say first. 
<A NAME="330"></A>One should also lead attacks sometimes against positions other than the 
<A NAME="331"></A>one stated, on the understood condition that one cannot find lines of attack 
<A NAME="332"></A>against the view laid down, as Lycophron did when ordered to deliver a 
<A NAME="333"></A>eulogy upon the lyre. To counter those who demand 'Against what are you 
<A NAME="334"></A>directing your effort?', since one is generally thought bound to state 
<A NAME="335"></A>the charge made, while, on the other hand, some ways of stating it make 
<A NAME="336"></A>the defence too easy, you should state as your aim only the general result 
<A NAME="337"></A>that always happens in refutations, namely the contradiction of his thesis 
<A NAME="338"></A>-viz. that your effort is to deny what he has affirmed, or to affirm what 
<A NAME="339"></A>he denied: don't say that you are trying to show that the knowledge of 
<A NAME="340"></A>contraries is, or is not, the same. One must not ask one's conclusion in 
<A NAME="341"></A>the form of a premiss, while some conclusions should not even be put as 
<A NAME="342"></A>questions at all; one should take and use it as granted.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="343"></A><B>Part 16</B>

<A NAME="344"></A><BR><BR>We have now therefore dealt with the sources of questions, and 
<A NAME="345"></A>the methods of questioning in contentious disputations: next we have to 
<A NAME="346"></A>speak of answering, and of how solutions should be made, and of what requires 
<A NAME="347"></A>them, and of what use is served by arguments of this 
<A NAME="348"></A>kind.
<A NAME="349"></A><BR><BR>The use of them, then, is, for philosophy, twofold. For in the 
<A NAME="350"></A>first place, since for the most part they depend upon the expression, they 
<A NAME="351"></A>put us in a better condition for seeing in how many senses any term is 
<A NAME="352"></A>used, and what kind of resemblances and what kind of differences occur 
<A NAME="353"></A>between things and between their names. In the second place they are useful 
<A NAME="354"></A>for one's own personal researches; for the man who is easily committed 
<A NAME="355"></A>to a fallacy by some one else, and does not perceive it, is likely to incur 
<A NAME="356"></A>this fate of himself also on many occasions. Thirdly and lastly, they further 
<A NAME="357"></A>contribute to one's reputation, viz. the reputation of being well trained 
<A NAME="358"></A>in everything, and not inexperienced in anything: for that a party to arguments 
<A NAME="359"></A>should find fault with them, if he cannot definitely point out their weakness, 
<A NAME="360"></A>creates a suspicion, making it seem as though it were not the truth of 
<A NAME="361"></A>the matter but merely inexperience that put him out of 
<A NAME="362"></A>temper.
<A NAME="363"></A><BR><BR>Answerers may clearly see how to meet arguments of this kind, if 
<A NAME="364"></A>our previous account was right of the sources whence fallacies came, and 
<A NAME="365"></A>also our distinctions adequate of the forms of dishonesty in putting questions. 
<A NAME="366"></A>But it is not the same thing take an argument in one's hand and then to 
<A NAME="367"></A>see and solve its faults, as it is to be able to meet it quickly while 
<A NAME="368"></A>being subjected to questions: for what we know, we often do not know in 
<A NAME="369"></A>a different context. Moreover, just as in other things speed is enhanced 
<A NAME="370"></A>by training, so it is with arguments too, so that supposing we are unpractised, 
<A NAME="371"></A>even though a point be clear to us, we are often too late for the right 
<A NAME="372"></A>moment. Sometimes too it happens as with diagrams; for there we can sometimes 
<A NAME="373"></A>analyse the figure, but not construct it again: so too in refutations, 
<A NAME="374"></A>though we know the thing on which the connexion of the argument depends, 
<A NAME="375"></A>we still are at a loss to split the argument apart.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="376"></A><B>Part 17</B>

<A NAME="377"></A><BR><BR>First then, just as we say that we ought sometimes to choose to 
<A NAME="378"></A>prove something in the general estimation rather than in truth, so also 
<A NAME="379"></A>we have sometimes to solve arguments rather in the general estimation than 
<A NAME="380"></A>according to the truth. For it is a general rule in fighting contentious 
<A NAME="381"></A>persons, to treat them not as refuting, but as merely appearing to refute: 
<A NAME="382"></A>for we say that they don't really prove their case, so that our object 
<A NAME="383"></A>in correcting them must be to dispel the appearance of it. For if refutation 
<A NAME="384"></A>be an unambiguous contradiction arrived at from certain views, there could 
<A NAME="385"></A>be no need to draw distinctions against amphiboly and ambiguity: they do 
<A NAME="386"></A>not effect a proof. The only motive for drawing further distinctions is 
<A NAME="387"></A>that the conclusion reached looks like a refutation. What, then, we have 
<A NAME="388"></A>to beware of, is not being refuted, but seeming to be, because of course 
<A NAME="389"></A>the asking of amphibolies and of questions that turn upon ambiguity, and 
<A NAME="390"></A>all the other tricks of that kind, conceal even a genuine refutation, and 
<A NAME="391"></A>make it uncertain who is refuted and who is not. For since one has the 
<A NAME="392"></A>right at the end, when the conclusion is drawn, to say that the only denial 
<A NAME="393"></A>made of One's statement is ambiguous, no matter how precisely he may have 
<A NAME="394"></A>addressed his argument to the very same point as oneself, it is not clear 
<A NAME="395"></A>whether one has been refuted: for it is not clear whether at the moment 
<A NAME="396"></A>one is speaking the truth. If, on the other hand, one had drawn a distinction, 
<A NAME="397"></A>and questioned him on the ambiguous term or the amphiboly, the refutation 
<A NAME="398"></A>would not have been a matter of uncertainty. Also what is incidentally 
<A NAME="399"></A>the object of contentious arguers, though less so nowadays than formerly, 
<A NAME="400"></A>would have been fulfilled, namely that the person questioned should answer 
<A NAME="401"></A>either 'Yes' or 'No': whereas nowadays the improper forms in which questioners 
<A NAME="402"></A>put their questions compel the party questioned to add something to his 
<A NAME="403"></A>answer in correction of the faultiness of the proposition as put: for certainly, 
<A NAME="404"></A>if the questioner distinguishes his meaning adequately, the answerer is 
<A NAME="405"></A>bound to reply either 'Yes' or 'No'.
<A NAME="406"></A><BR><BR>If any one is going to suppose that an argument which turns upon 
<A NAME="407"></A>ambiguity is a refutation, it will be impossible for an answerer to escape 
<A NAME="408"></A>being refuted in a sense: for in the case of visible objects one is bound 
<A NAME="409"></A>of necessity to deny the term one has asserted, and to assert what one 
<A NAME="410"></A>has denied. For the remedy which some people have for this is quite unavailing. 
<A NAME="411"></A>They say, not that Coriscus is both musical and unmusical, but that this 
<A NAME="412"></A>Coriscus is musical and this Coriscus unmusical. But this will not do, 
<A NAME="413"></A>for to say 'this Coriscus is unmusical', or 'musical', and to say 'this 
<A NAME="414"></A>Coriscus' is so, is to use the same expression: and this he is both affirming 
<A NAME="415"></A>and denying at once. 'But perhaps they do not mean the same.' Well, nor 
<A NAME="416"></A>did the simple name in the former case: so where is the difference? If, 
<A NAME="417"></A>however, he is to ascribe to the one person the simple title 'Coriscus', 
<A NAME="418"></A>while to the other he is to add the prefix 'one' or 'this', he commits 
<A NAME="419"></A>an absurdity: for the latter is no more applicable to the one than to the 
<A NAME="420"></A>other: for to whichever he adds it, it makes no difference.
<A NAME="421"></A><BR><BR>All the same, since if a man does not distinguish the senses of 
<A NAME="422"></A>an amphiboly, it is not clear whether he has been confuted or has not been 
<A NAME="423"></A>confuted, and since in arguments the right to distinguish them is granted, 
<A NAME="424"></A>it is evident that to grant the question simply without drawing any distinction 
<A NAME="425"></A>is a mistake, so that, even if not the man himself, at any rate his argument 
<A NAME="426"></A>looks as though it had been refuted. It often happens, however, that, though 
<A NAME="427"></A>they see the amphiboly, people hesitate to draw such distinctions, because 
<A NAME="428"></A>of the dense crowd of persons who propose questions of the kind, in order 
<A NAME="429"></A>that they may not be thought to be obstructionists at every turn: then, 
<A NAME="430"></A>though they would never have supposed that that was the point on which 
<A NAME="431"></A>the argument turned, they often find themselves faced by a paradox. Accordingly, 
<A NAME="432"></A>since the right of drawing the distinction is granted, one should not hesitate, 
<A NAME="433"></A>as has been said before.
<A NAME="434"></A><BR><BR>If people never made two questions into one question, the fallacy 
<A NAME="435"></A>that turns upon ambiguity and amphiboly would not have existed either, 
<A NAME="436"></A>but either genuine refutation or none. For what is the difference between 
<A NAME="437"></A>asking 'Are Callias and Themistocles musical?' and what one might have 
<A NAME="438"></A>asked if they, being different, had had one name? For if the term applied 
<A NAME="439"></A>means more than one thing, he has asked more than one question. If then 
<A NAME="440"></A>it be not right to demand simply to be given a single answer to two questions, 
<A NAME="441"></A>it is evident that it is not proper to give a simple answer to any ambiguous 
<A NAME="442"></A>question, not even if the predicate be true of all the subjects, as some 
<A NAME="443"></A>claim that one should. For this is exactly as though he had asked 'Are 
<A NAME="444"></A>Coriscus and Callias at home or not at home?', supposing them to be both 
<A NAME="445"></A>in or both out: for in both cases there is a number of propositions: for 
<A NAME="446"></A>though the simple answer be true, that does not make the question one. 
<A NAME="447"></A>For it is possible for it to be true to answer even countless different 
<A NAME="448"></A>questions when put to one, all together with either a 'Yes' or a 'No': 
<A NAME="449"></A>but still one should not answer them with a single answer: for that is 
<A NAME="450"></A>the death of discussion. Rather, the case is like as though different things 
<A NAME="451"></A>has actually had the same name applied to them. If then, one should not 
<A NAME="452"></A>give a single answer to two questions, it is evident that we should not 
<A NAME="453"></A>say simply 'Yes' or 'No' in the case of ambiguous terms either: for the 
<A NAME="454"></A>remark is simply a remark, not an answer at all, although among disputants 
<A NAME="455"></A>such remarks are loosely deemed to be answers, because they do not see 
<A NAME="456"></A>what the consequence is.
<A NAME="457"></A><BR><BR>As we said, then, inasmuch as certain refutations are generally 
<A NAME="458"></A>taken for such, though not such really, in the same way also certain solutions 
<A NAME="459"></A>will be generally taken for solutions, though not really such. Now these, 
<A NAME="460"></A>we say, must sometimes be advanced rather than the true solutions in contentious 
<A NAME="461"></A>reasonings and in the encounter with ambiguity. The proper answer in saying 
<A NAME="462"></A>what one thinks is to say 'Granted'; for in that way the likelihood of 
<A NAME="463"></A>being refuted on a side issue is minimized. If, on the other hand, one 
<A NAME="464"></A>is compelled to say something paradoxical, one should then be most careful 
<A NAME="465"></A>to add that 'it seems' so: for in that way one avoids the impression of 
<A NAME="466"></A>being either refuted or paradoxical. Since it is clear what is meant by 
<A NAME="467"></A>'begging the original question', and people think that they must at all 
<A NAME="468"></A>costs overthrow the premisses that lie near the conclusion, and plead in 
<A NAME="469"></A>excuse for refusing to grant him some of them that he is begging the original 
<A NAME="470"></A>question, so whenever any one claims from us a point such as is bound to 
<A NAME="471"></A>follow as a consequence from our thesis, but is false or paradoxical, we 
<A NAME="472"></A>must plead the same: for the necessary consequences are generally held 
<A NAME="473"></A>to be a part of the thesis itself. Moreover, whenever the universal has 
<A NAME="474"></A>been secured not under a definite name, but by a comparison of instances, 
<A NAME="475"></A>one should say that the questioner assumes it not in the sense in which 
<A NAME="476"></A>it was granted nor in which he proposed it in the premiss: for this too 
<A NAME="477"></A>is a point upon which a refutation often depends.
<A NAME="478"></A><BR><BR>If one is debarred from these defences one must pass to the argument 
<A NAME="479"></A>that the conclusion has not been properly shown, approaching it in the 
<A NAME="480"></A>light of the aforesaid distinction between the different kinds of 
<A NAME="481"></A>fallacy.
<A NAME="482"></A><BR><BR>In the case, then, of names that are used literally one is bound 
<A NAME="483"></A>to answer either simply or by drawing a distinction: the tacit understandings 
<A NAME="484"></A>implied in our statements, e.g. in answer to questions that are not put 
<A NAME="485"></A>clearly but elliptically-it is upon this that the consequent refutation 
<A NAME="486"></A>depends. For example, 'Is what belongs to Athenians the property of Athenians?' 
<A NAME="487"></A>Yes. 'And so it is likewise in other cases. But observe; man belongs to 
<A NAME="488"></A>the animal kingdom, doesn't he?' Yes. 'Then man is the property of the 
<A NAME="489"></A>animal kingdom.' But this is a fallacy: for we say that man 'belongs to' 
<A NAME="490"></A>the animal kingdom because he is an animal, just as we say that Lysander 
<A NAME="491"></A>'belongs to' the Spartans, because he is a Spartan. It is evident, then, 
<A NAME="492"></A>that where the premiss put forward is not clear, one must not grant it 
<A NAME="493"></A>simply.
<A NAME="494"></A><BR><BR>Whenever of two things it is generally thought that if the one 
<A NAME="495"></A>is true the other is true of necessity, whereas, if the other is true, 
<A NAME="496"></A>the first is not true of necessity, one should, if asked which of them 
<A NAME="497"></A>is true, grant the smaller one: for the larger the number of premisses, 
<A NAME="498"></A>the harder it is to draw a conclusion from them. If, again, the sophist 
<A NAME="499"></A>tries to secure that has a contrary while B has not, suppose what he says 
<A NAME="500"></A>is true, you should say that each has a contrary, only for the one there 
<A NAME="501"></A>is no established name.
<A NAME="502"></A><BR><BR>Since, again, in regard to some of the views they express, most 
<A NAME="503"></A>people would say that any one who did not admit them was telling a falsehood, 
<A NAME="504"></A>while they would not say this in regard to some, e.g. to any matters whereon 
<A NAME="505"></A>opinion is divided (for most people have no distinct view whether the soul 
<A NAME="506"></A>of animals is destructible or immortal), accordingly (1) it is uncertain 
<A NAME="507"></A>in which of two senses the premiss proposed is usually meant-whether as 
<A NAME="508"></A>maxims are (for people call by the name of 'maxims' both true opinions 
<A NAME="509"></A>and general assertions) or like the doctrine 'the diagonal of a square 
<A NAME="510"></A>is incommensurate with its side': and moreover (2) whenever opinions are 
<A NAME="511"></A>divided as to the truth, we then have subjects of which it is very easy 
<A NAME="512"></A>to change the terminology undetected. For because of the uncertainty in 
<A NAME="513"></A>which of the two senses the premiss contains the truth, one will not be 
<A NAME="514"></A>thought to be playing any trick, while because of the division of opinion, 
<A NAME="515"></A>one will not be thought to be telling a falsehood. Change the terminology 
<A NAME="516"></A>therefore, for the change will make the position irrefutable.
<A NAME="517"></A><BR><BR>Moreover, whenever one foresees any question coming, one should 
<A NAME="518"></A>put in one's objection and have one's say beforehand: for by doing so one 
<A NAME="519"></A>is likely to embarrass the questioner most effectually.

<A NAME="521"></A><BR><BR>Inasmuch as a proper solution is an exposure of false reasoning, 
<A NAME="522"></A>showing on what kind of question the falsity depends, and whereas 'false 
<A NAME="523"></A>reasoning' has a double meaning-for it is used either if a false conclusion 
<A NAME="524"></A>has been proved, or if there is only an apparent proof and no real one-there 
<A NAME="525"></A>must be both the kind of solution just described,' and also the correction 
<A NAME="526"></A>of a merely apparent proof, so as to show upon which of the questions the 
<A NAME="527"></A>appearance depends. Thus it comes about that one solves arguments that 
<A NAME="528"></A>are properly reasoned by demolishing them, whereas one solves merely apparent 
<A NAME="529"></A>arguments by drawing distinctions. Again, inasmuch as of arguments that 
<A NAME="530"></A>are properly reasoned some have a true and others a false conclusion, those 
<A NAME="531"></A>that are false in respect of their conclusion it is possible to solve in 
<A NAME="532"></A>two ways; for it is possible both by demolishing one of the premisses asked, 
<A NAME="533"></A>and by showing that the conclusion is not the real state of the case: those, 
<A NAME="534"></A>on the other hand, that are false in respect of the premisses can be solved 
<A NAME="535"></A>only by a demolition of one of them; for the conclusion is true. So that 
<A NAME="536"></A>those who wish to solve an argument should in the first place look and 
<A NAME="537"></A>see if it is properly reasoned, or is unreasoned; and next, whether the 
<A NAME="538"></A>conclusion be true or false, in order that we may effect the solution either 
<A NAME="539"></A>by drawing some distinction or by demolishing something, and demolishing 
<A NAME="540"></A>it either in this way or in that, as was laid down before. There is a very 
<A NAME="541"></A>great deal of difference between solving an argument when being subjected 
<A NAME="542"></A>to questions and when not: for to foresee traps is difficult, whereas to 
<A NAME="543"></A>see them at one's leisure is easier.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="544"></A><B>Part 19</B>

<A NAME="545"></A><BR><BR>Of the refutations, then, that depend upon ambiguity and amphiboly 
<A NAME="546"></A>some contain some question with more than one meaning, while others contain 
<A NAME="547"></A>a conclusion bearing a number of senses: e.g. in the proof that 'speaking 
<A NAME="548"></A>of the silent' is possible, the conclusion has a double meaning, while 
<A NAME="549"></A>in the proof that 'he who knows does not understand what he knows' one 
<A NAME="550"></A>of the questions contains an amphiboly. Also the double-edged saying is 
<A NAME="551"></A>true in one context but not in another: it means something that is and 
<A NAME="552"></A>something that is not.
<A NAME="553"></A><BR><BR>Whenever, then, the many senses lie in the conclusion no refutation 
<A NAME="554"></A>takes place unless the sophist secures as well the contradiction of the 
<A NAME="555"></A>conclusion he means to prove; e.g. in the proof that 'seeing of the blind' 
<A NAME="556"></A>is possible: for without the contradiction there was no refutation. Whenever, 
<A NAME="557"></A>on the other hand, the many senses lie in the questions, there is no necessity 
<A NAME="558"></A>to begin by denying the double-edged premiss: for this was not the goal 
<A NAME="559"></A>of the argument but only its support. At the start, then, one should reply 
<A NAME="560"></A>with regard to an ambiguity, whether of a term or of a phrase, in this 
<A NAME="561"></A>manner, that 'in one sense it is so, and in another not so', as e.g. that 
<A NAME="562"></A>'speaking of the silent' is in one sense possible but in another not possible: 
<A NAME="563"></A>also that in one sense 'one should do what must needs be done', but not 
<A NAME="564"></A>in another: for 'what must needs be' bears a number of senses. If, however, 
<A NAME="565"></A>the ambiguity escapes one, one should correct it at the end by making an 
<A NAME="566"></A>addition to the question: 'Is speaking of the silent possible?' 'No, but 
<A NAME="567"></A>to speak of while he is silent is possible.' Also, in cases which contain 
<A NAME="568"></A>the ambiguity in their premisses, one should reply in like manner: 'Do 
<A NAME="569"></A>people-then not understand what they know? "Yes, but not those who know 
<A NAME="570"></A>it in the manner described': for it is not the same thing to say that 'those 
<A NAME="571"></A>who know cannot understand what they know', and to say that 'those who 
<A NAME="572"></A>know something in this particular manner cannot do so'. In general, too, 
<A NAME="573"></A>even though he draws his conclusion in a quite unambiguous manner, one 
<A NAME="574"></A>should contend that what he has negated is not the fact which one has asserted 
<A NAME="575"></A>but only its name; and that therefore there is no refutation.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="576"></A><B>Part 20</B>

<A NAME="577"></A><BR><BR>It is evident also how one should solve those refutations that 
<A NAME="578"></A>depend upon the division and combination of words: for if the expression 
<A NAME="579"></A>means something different when divided and when combined, as soon as one's 
<A NAME="580"></A>opponent draws his conclusion one should take the expression in the contrary 
<A NAME="581"></A>way. All such expressions as the following depend upon the combination 
<A NAME="582"></A>or division of the words: 'Was X being beaten with that with which you 
<A NAME="583"></A>saw him being beaten?' and 'Did you see him being beaten with that with 
<A NAME="584"></A>which he was being beaten?' This fallacy has also in it an element of amphiboly 
<A NAME="585"></A>in the questions, but it really depends upon combination. For the meaning 
<A NAME="586"></A>that depends upon the division of the words is not really a double meaning 
<A NAME="587"></A>(for the expression when divided is not the same), unless also the word 
<A NAME="588"></A>that is pronounced, according to its breathing, as eros and eros is a case 
<A NAME="589"></A>of double meaning. (In writing, indeed, a word is the same whenever it 
<A NAME="590"></A>is written of the same letters and in the same manner- and even there people 
<A NAME="591"></A>nowadays put marks at the side to show the pronunciation- but the spoken 
<A NAME="592"></A>words are not the same.) Accordingly an expression that depends upon division 
<A NAME="593"></A>is not an ambiguous one. It is evident also that not all refutations depend 
<A NAME="594"></A>upon ambiguity as some people say they do.
<A NAME="595"></A><BR><BR>The answerer, then, must divide the expression: for 'I-saw-a-man-being-beaten 
<A NAME="596"></A>with my eyes' is not the same as to say 'I saw a man being-beaten-with-my-eyes'. 
<A NAME="597"></A>Also there is the argument of Euthydemus proving 'Then you know now in 
<A NAME="598"></A>Sicily that there are triremes in Piraeus': and again, 'Can a good man 
<A NAME="599"></A>who is a cobbler be bad?' 'No.' 'But a good man may be a bad cobbler: therefore 
<A NAME="600"></A>a good cobbler will be bad.' Again, 'Things the knowledge of which is good, 
<A NAME="601"></A>are good things to learn, aren't they?' 'Yes.' 'The knowledge, however, 
<A NAME="602"></A>of evil is good: therefore evil is a good thing to know.' 'Yes. But, you 
<A NAME="603"></A>see, evil is both evil and a thing-to-learn, so that evil is an evil-thing-to-learn, 
<A NAME="604"></A>although the knowledge of evils is good.' Again, 'Is it true to say in 
<A NAME="605"></A>the present moment that you are born?' 'Yes.' 'Then you are born in the 
<A NAME="606"></A>present moment.' 'No; the expression as divided has a different meaning: 
<A NAME="607"></A>for it is true to say-in-the-present-moment that "you are born", but not 
<A NAME="608"></A>"You are born-in-the-present-moment".' Again, 'Could you do what you can, 
<A NAME="609"></A>and as you can?' 'Yes.' 'But when not harping, you have the power to harp: 
<A NAME="610"></A>and therefore you could harp when not harping.' 'No: he has not the power 
<A NAME="611"></A>to harp-while-not-harping; merely, when he is not doing it, he has the 
<A NAME="612"></A>power to do it.' Some people solve this last refutation in another way 
<A NAME="613"></A>as well. For, they say, if he has granted that he can do anything in the 
<A NAME="614"></A>way he can, still it does not follow that he can harp when not harping: 
<A NAME="615"></A>for it has not been granted that he will do anything in every way in which 
<A NAME="616"></A>he can; and it is not the same thing' to do a thing in the way he can' 
<A NAME="617"></A>and 'to do it in every way in which he can'. But evidently they do not 
<A NAME="618"></A>solve it properly: for of arguments that depend upon the same point the 
<A NAME="619"></A>solution is the same, whereas this will not fit all cases of the kind nor 
<A NAME="620"></A>yet all ways of putting the questions: it is valid against the questioner, 
<A NAME="621"></A>but not against his argument.
